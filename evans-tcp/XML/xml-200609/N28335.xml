<HEAD>TO THE LADY OF THE PRESIDENT VON DER WENSE, OF THE FAMILY OF AHLEFELD.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been often said, that poetry and love obey no or∣ders. It is not true, my most amiable friend; since, if your memory is faithful in respect to trifles, you will recollect that this play has to thank your commands alone for its existence.</P>
<P>On a dark and rainy evening in Pyrmont, which pro∣hibited the enjoyment of the charms of nature, you took refuge in the temple of Thalia. Nauman's opera of Cora was the piece performed. The performers were bad, and my only pleasure arose from being placed behind you and partaking at times of your conversation. Among other observations you remarked, "that this opera con∣tained an excellent subject for a play."</P>
<P>I felt that this idea would have originated with me, if I had not been situated exactly as I was: however, I seiz∣ed it with avidity, and entreated you to command the execution. This was long refused. Commands are not the language of my friend. However, I insisted upon a positive command.</P>
<P>"Well, then, I command it," you said at length, with a naiveté all your own. I bowed—and behold, here stands my "Virgin of the Sun." At your command the poor maiden appears trembling in your anti-chamber. Give permission that she may enter, and attend your toi∣lette with downcast eyes, until you beckon her forward with the smile of friendship.</P>
<P>"Approach, my child! Thou shalt be welcome to me for thy father's sake, who possesses my friendship, and from whom I would now be far from withdrawing the least of his joys, since so little remains in this world for him to lose."</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="037763_0005_100F0972C15E4010"/>
Alas! it is too true! I possessed a treasure once that might have been compared to you—for she was the best of wives and of mothers. She has gone to the house of her father, to mingle with her sister angels. You drop∣ped a tear over my sorrows. For that tear my heart still thanks you, and impels my pen to this open declaration of my highest esteem and admiration.</P>

<HEAD>SCENE FIRST.</HEAD>
<STAGE>The stage represents a wild and woody country, in the vicinity of the Temple of the Sun; on one side the cave of Rolla, on the other a rocky and tow∣ering hill. The outer wall surrounding the tem∣ple is seen at a little distance through the trees, with a breach which has been made in it by an earthquake. Further back the cupola of the tem∣ple appears rising above the trees. Time, evening.</STAGE>
<STAGE>ROLLA <HI>and the</HI> HIGH PRIEST OF THE SUN <HI>come down the stage from behind the hill.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>THIS, then, is the way to Rolla's dwell∣ing?—Alas! as wild, as inaccessible as the way to Rolla's heart!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Spare me, uncle! I entreat you! spare me, and leave me!—If you could understand me—could conceive—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thinkest thou I do not? But to under∣stand thee means—to worship thy idol. To con∣ceive thee aright is—to flatter thy passion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wretch that I am!—I am a being without kindred or associate!—A drop with which no other drop shall ever mingle or flow;—a lonely voice,
<PB N="8" REF="037763_0009_100F097A9133D2E8"/>
which finds no echo through the vast expanse of ani∣mated nature. The pigmy worm that crawls upon this leaf—see! already comes its mate to meet him—but I! I alone—O, ye gods! it is your mighty will, that I in the immensity of your creation, I only should be left alone!—Then man—man leave me alone!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rolla, I love thee as a father!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, be the repose of thy son dear to thee! Suffer him to live according to his own pleasure. Be this cave my tomb. One promise, alone, would I exact from thee: on some dark and troubled day, lead Cora to the entrance of this cavern, show her the remains of Rolla, as he, upon the damp and cold earth, breathed forth his life and her name together. Then, perhaps, touch∣ed by this spectacle, she may stand near, and drop a flower—or a tear on my corse!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Young man, young man, remember what thou hast been, and be ashamed: remember what thou oughtest to be, and blush. Endowed with energies for the noblest deeds, perhaps to bless a world, thou contractest thy circle of action—to the limits of a cave.—Inca! born of the race of the children of the sun, entitled to stand the first bulwark of the throne—thou fliest to a cave:—Chieftain! called to lead the armies of thy country—thou buriest thyself in a cave!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would you entice me to boast of my deeds?—As Inca and as chieftain I have done my duty, covered with wounds and victories. I have prov∣ed my zeal and my valor in many a well-sought field—I proved them more especially on that day when the throne of Ataliba shook beneath the pow∣er of Iluascar, and Rolla's sword enriched the fields
<PB N="9" REF="037763_0010_100F097C1368CFA0"/>
of Tumibamba with the blood of his sovereign's enemies. But for whom should I now fight?—Whose heart will leap with joy as Rolla ascends the road to fame?—Cora loves me not!—I have neither father or mother—neither brother or sister!—I am alone in the world!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. P.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>(Clasping him in his arms)</HI> My son! my son!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Leave me, uncle; leave me! I cannot return this love. You—with those venerable locks; those reverend robes—you cannot be the confidant of my heart. O, that I had a mother! that I had a father!—But the love of no one rests upon me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fly, then, to the gods!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rol.</SPEAKER>
<P>The gods hate me, because I love a maid∣en who is devoted to their service: because I love this maiden more than the gods themselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>May the gods pardon this enthusiasm! Rolla, it is thus that mortals always desire most ardently that which is unattainable. Cora, the maiden had only pleased you: Cora, the virgin of the sun you love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rol.</SPEAKER>
<P>What? <HI>(He casts a look of displeasure on the High Priest.)</HI> Good night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whither, young man? Has, then, thy friend no influence over thee? Live as seems good to thee. Retire when thou wilt from society, but leave this desert where wild images disorder thy soul as the wild thorn tears thy body. Come to my dwelling: there no intruders shall disturb thy dreams. Even to me may thy doors be closed—mine ever are open to thee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rol.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you. I feel that your intentions are kind. But Rolla is resolved to live and die in
<PB N="10" REF="037763_0011_100F097ED7EE53D8"/>
this cave. There, where the cupola of the tem∣ple towers above the trees—there lives Cora. And here will Rolla live and die.—Good night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Obstinate man! Yet, remember your duties in the solemnities of to-morrow. The great festival of the sun requires your presence in the palace and in the temple.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Excuse me. Say what you will to the king—tell him, Rolla is dead!—I come no more among men. Yet, to-morrow morning will I sa∣crifice to the gods—The temple and the cavern are alike to them. Good night.</P>

<SPEAKER>Dieg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right path! Who told you that I was in the wrong path? It were a good joke if a man of my civilization had come among savages for instruction. My lord, the high priest of the tem∣ple of the sun, you are, St. Peter pardon me the comparison, a sort of a pope among these lizards and rattle-snakes; yet give me leave to tell you, that there is not a muleteer in Andalusia who is not a better catholic than you are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. P.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>(Smiling.)</HI> I believe it. But, prythee, explain to me this riddle. How is it that I find you here by night, and yet in the right way? Are you alone? or is your master at hand? for I can never believe, that you came hither among these thistles and thorns merely for a walk.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dieg.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>(Hesitating.)</HI> Since you press me so close∣ly—why—why—I must confess—though it is so long since I have been at confession, that it comes rather aukward—I—I am in love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. P.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>(Smiling.)</HI> You are in love?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dieg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, to desperation! I am tortured with jealousy! Almost driven to madness! Some∣times I am hurried to the mountain's top; some∣times precipitated into the deepest caverns!—At present I find myself—<HI>here</HI>—all among the bushes—murmuring with turtle-doves, and talking with your holiness. Here will I tell my sorrows to the trees, and waft my sighs in anguish to the moon.</P>
</SP>

<P>You are a coxcomb.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>

<P>A coxcomb?—So much the worse for you. For in that case, the great high priest of the sun has been made a fool of by a coxcomb. Wit forever! say I. It is worth its value in the new world as well as in the old.—But is he really gone? Yes: I hear nothing more. Hist! hist!</P>

<P>Diego, are we safe?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dieg.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very pretty question. Yes, we are as safe as men can be, who are wandering about a forest at the dead of night, and under the airy canopy of heaven; running after, saving your ho∣nor's presence, a piece of knavery. By St. Bar∣nabas, I believe we are about as safe as a drunkard who shall attempt to cross the river of Amazons upon a wire.</P>

<P>The high priest? What could have brought him here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dieg.</SPEAKER>
<P>He came, sir, out of pure kindness to me—to put me in the right path. I find it's the same here as in all other countries; priests are the only people who are able to lead us into the right path.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Al.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what motive could lead him into the wilderness?—Speak, Velasquez.</P>

<P>Do speak, sir—speak, I entreat you!—When it is dark I always love to hear talking.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, be it so. If it be only to kill time for you, Alonzo, until your star rises. Time is always a tedious companion when one is waiting for the fulfilment of a tender appointment. I will, therefore, talk until you shall cry silence, and my text shall be—Friend! this adventure bodes thee no good! Believe me, it bodes no good!</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Al.</SPEAKER>
<P>A strange discourse in thy mouth! When did Don Juan Velasquez turn his back upon an adventure because it was dangerous?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juan.</SPEAKER>
<P>There it is!—Hark you, Alonzo! if you were capable of doubting my courage, I might en∣gage the next rattle-snake we meet to convince you.—You know my principles. I do not value my life more highly than a moment of happiness, and happy is every moment <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I sacrifice to friend∣ship. If you love me, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> more of this. My life is my friend's.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juan.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Alonzo, Alonzo, the happiness I mean is inseparable from virtue; it lives but in the health of the soul. Lay your hand upon your heart and tell me; what are your sensations in the moments of temperance and reflection? Don Alonzo Molina quitted the savage followers of Pizarro, because he abhorred their barbarities—because he saw in every Indian an unoffending brother. That was noble! "I will go," said he, "among these well-deserving people, and be their friend and instructor." This was worthy of my friend!—You put in execution your benevolent plan. You were received—beloved—honored—and cherished. What followed? On one of their solemn festivals, my noble friend Alonzo beholds in the temple a priestess of the sun, as she presents the bread of sacrifice to the king. She is young—she is lovely. The heart of my friend is in∣flamed—suddenly all his great designs are lost in the sea of oblivion; and the champion of the rights of humanity slumbers on his post.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Away with that menacing look! It be∣comes thee not. The man that dares to become angry should have a pure conscience. Wonder not, that the gay Velasquez should turn preacher. Velasquez is gay because he is honest. You, Alon∣zo, by whom every article of popular faith was once deemed sacred, because on each hung the repose of some well-meaning man: you rashly throw aside the most holy tenet of a whole nation, and seduce a chaste virgin from the service of her gods.</P>
</SP>

<P>Thou art unmerciful, Velasquez. Believe me, my conscience sleeps not. I see my dan∣ger—</P>

<P>The devil! Is not that enough?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juan.</SPEAKER>
<P>But Cora hazards all—her fame, her fa∣ther's blessing, her hopes of eternal happiness—And the death she must suffer, according to the laws of the country, is shocking beyond mortal endurance. Living must she be entombed. Bu∣ried alive in the vaulted earth, which will be closed above her, she will gasp for air, until hunger and despair shall end her miserable existence—</P>

<P><HI>(Shaking his hand.)</HI> Alonzo—when I see a boy struggling in the water, it is not my practice to call to him—" You should not have fallen in." I draw him out, if I can.—But here, we are fairly in the mire, and the devil fetch me if I see the way to get out of it. If we had a ship, or a conjur∣er's cloak, to whisk us off through the air, Don Juan Velasquez would not be the last among the fugitives. But, as it is—arm thyself with courage Velasquez—wrap thyself up to the teeth in thy cloak, and let the thunder and lightning come when it will.</P>

<P>Well, let nobody tell me again, that sound is nothing. Here has the reverend Don Juan Ve∣lasquez been preaching like a bishop; yet scarcely does the sound produced by the clapping of two heathenish hands reach the culprit who was doing penance under the lecture, but all the moralizing is lost in the air, and the penitent skips off to fit him∣self for another confession.</P>

<P>Were I in the place of the most valiant and noble knight Don Juan Velasquez, I would, in the first place, deliver a sermon pretty much as he has done; and, if it produced no effect, as is usual, I would then say, my dear friend, Alonzo, or Don Alonzo, or Don Alonzo De Molina, you cannot expect in reason that I should stay here to be roasted alive for your sake. You will be burnt at the stake, without doubt: farewell—I wish you much pleasure.—I shall return home, and take ho∣nest Diego, or trusty Diego, or our trusty and well-beloved friend Diego with me—And when Diego and I, or I and Diego, are safe in Madrid, we will say a prayer to help you out of your diffi∣culties.</P>

<P>Give me leave to observe, sir, that ac∣cording to the opinions of the wisest among the an∣cient philosophers, night was formed for the pur∣poses of rest; and if the man himself does not go to sleep in the dark, his courage always takes that opportunity of enjoying a nap.

<STAGE>ALONZO <HI>springs over the ruins of the wall, and as∣sists</HI> CORA <HI>to do the same.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Al.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only one little jump, dear Cora! Throw yourself boldly into my arms!—At length I have thee again in my embrace. It is now three long weeks—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only three weeks?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Al.</SPEAKER>
<P>Months to love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.</SPEAKER>
<P>Years to my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Al.</SPEAKER>
<P>Each evening with the twilight has Alonzo visited this spot, and anxiously waited and listened to hear the signal which should summon him to his Cora.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.</SPEAKER>
<P>And every evening has Cora wept that she could not meet her Alonzo.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Al.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have not been ill I hope?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas, I am always ill when I am not with you. It was not thus with me formerly. I used to be gentle and quiet; but now I am ever discon∣tented—I am not the same good Cora. Now when I sit at my daily work, and spin or weave, if on∣ly a thread breaks, I become so peevish, that I sometimes am frightened with myself. Tell me, Alonzo, does love make us better or worse?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Al.</SPEAKER>
<P>True love makes us better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh no! no! True love dwells in my heart, and yet I am worse than I was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="20" REF="037763_0021_100F09941F095FA0"/>
<SPEAKER>Al.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, indeed. A strange but pleasing sad∣ness has taken possession of my heart. When, at the last festival, I adorned the porch of the temple with flowers, I saw upon the steps a young woman lying asleep, and on her breast lay a little lovely angel, which smiled as it looked in my face. My full heart melted—I stretched out my arms to the child—I wished softly to steal it from its mo∣ther, and press it to my throbbing bosom. But what is so easily broken as the slumbers of a ten∣der mother? Hardly had I touched the child, ere she sprung anxiously up, clasped her treasure close to her heart, and darted in my face a look of displeasure and distrust. Alonzo, is it not ho∣norable to be a mother?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Al.</SPEAKER>
<P>Cora! Cora!—Do you not know what you swore when this image of the sun was placed on your breast.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.</SPEAKER>
<P>To obey the mandates of our temple.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Al.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what do they enjoin?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not. My father told me that by whomsoever virtue was held sacred, its precepts would be fulfilled without particular instructions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Al.</SPEAKER>
<P>And know you then what constitutes vir∣tue? Alas! you know not the terrible distinction between virtue as founded on the eternal principles of nature, and virtue as fashioned by the distorted imaginations of erring men. O Cora! Cora! The most horrible of deaths awaits you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.</SPEAKER>
<P>Death!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Al.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I—I am your murderer!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why do you torment yourself thus with∣out cause? Who will put me to death? And why?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Al.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your priests will say you have offended the gods.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="21" REF="037763_0022_100F0996B9080578"/>
<SPEAKER>Co.</SPEAKER>
<P>I offend the gods?—No, Alonzo, I love the gods.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Al.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet will you be the victim of ancient su∣perstition. No safety remains to us but flight—flight—whither fly? a stranger—in a foreign land!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dearest self-tormentor! I have thought of a way to set your heart at rest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Al.</SPEAKER>
<P>If so, it must be suggested by heaven.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is sure and simple. Yes, the rising of this morning's sun, shall show, whether the feel∣ings of my heart deceive me, whether the gods are displeased or not with Cora. Hitherto the moon and stars alone have been the witnesses of our love; but the sun himself, the greatest of our gods, shall now be the witness and the judge. We will ascend yonder hill together. We will turn our faces towards the east, and joining hand in hand, as a token of our union, boldly await the rising of our god. If Cora have done evil, either the sun will veil himself from her sight, or the first ray of his light which falls upon her, will annihilate the criminal. Soon will his beams ap∣pear above the horizon; hasten, hasten to ascend the hill! <HI>(She ascends the hill, Alonzo follows her.)</HI> Behold!—A minute longer and we had been too late—see how the east is streaked with gold! Oh! rejoice, Alonzo! No cloud troubles the serenity of my god—he is not offended! <HI>(She kneels.)</HI> Father, I thank thee!—Oh! if what I feel is sin∣ful, be thy glorious countenance veiled in dark∣ness as a token of thy wrath!—No! See, Alon∣zo, he smiles! he blesses your Cora!—O, my heart is full of joy and gratitude! Kneel with me, Alonzo, and let us offer our prayers and our thanks.</P>

years have I only at awful distance gazed at the virgin of the sun.—Now—I behold Cora again!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hear him, Alonzo. Hear how kind, how good is Rolla. My mother used ever to say—"Rolla is good; love him, become his wife, and I shall die in peace."—But my poor mother died, and Rolla was gone to the wars, and a sacred flame was kindled in my bosom. He came back, but I could not love him. My heart listened only to the gods, and I sighed for the day on which I should be wedded to the sun.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rol.</SPEAKER>
<P>But enthusiasm has at length yielded to nature—You love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Co.</SPEAKER>
<P>I love! Yes, Rolla, I love this young man. I saw him for the first time in the temple. He stood by the side of the king. I trembled, and the offering almost fell from my hand. His ardent looks, rivetted on me, told me his heart was mine. The gods saw, and pitied us. You must well re∣member those awful days, when for several months the mountains shot forth fire; the sea boiled; and the earth quaked—When our buildings were laid in ruins, and even the holy temple of the sun was burst in two several places, and the sacred walls which surround it were rent in twain. We, poor terror-struck creatures, ran from the death that threatened us in our cells—but, under the wide canopy of heaven, still death pursued us. The earth yawned—the walls crash'd—we mingled our shrieks with the groans of suffering nature. Alon∣zo, ever watchful, perceived the breach in the wall, and boldly rushed among the ruins. There opened the earth, and here my arms, to receive him. He gave me life; I gave him love.</P>

<P>They were not in the temple.</P>

<P>What, then, had they flown over the high walls into the garden?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ida.</SPEAKER>
<P>They were not in the garden.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ama.</SPEAKER>
<P>But they might have come in as easily as we got out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. P's.</SPEAKER>
<P>You got out of the garden? And how could that be managed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ida.</SPEAKER>
<P>According to your orders we went to look for Cora. We ran hither and thither, and called her by her name, but to no purpose; till, at last, as we were looking about and listening, we thought we heard voices on the other side of the wall, just by the arbour, where the little stream is lost in the wood. We followed the sound, and crept softly through the thick bushes, till, at length, we came to a great, great rent in the wall, from the top to the bottom, and so broad that Amazili and I could easily go through it, and we had only to step over a few stones to get quite on the outside.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. P's.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you did step over the stones and get on the outside?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Else we should not have found Cora.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. P's.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! What, she too had stepped over the stones?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ida.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and was talking with the Spaniards. At first we thought they were men, and were go∣ing to run away; but they entreated us very ear∣nestly to stay: and, as we found they really were only Spaniards, we thought there could be no harm in complying with them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ama.</SPEAKER>
<P>And they wanted us to promise that we would come again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. P's.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which promise you made?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ida.</SPEAKER>

<P>Two years ago was I here with daugh∣ter Cora, I devoted her to the service of the gods, because it was her wish. It was a heavy blow to my age; truth demands the confession.

Oh! had you known me in youth, you would have seen one more eager to brandish the sword in the face of my country's enemies, than to hold the knife to the throat of the lambs and turtle doves of the altar. Believe me, few are the men who stand in

<P>Rolla, Rolla, I can no longer endure the chilling frown upon thy brow, and the cold contempt of thine eye. Thou—the only being on whom my love hangs, the only being for whose love I pant! Listen to my mournful story! Alas, it nearly resembles thine own.—My sorrows are the sorrows of the heart! my sufferings are the sufferings of hopeless love! I also loved a virgin of the sun.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rol.</SPEAKER>
<P>How!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>As high priest I had free access at all times to the house of the stars. My eyes roved at pleasure among the blossoms which were daily unfolded within its walls. This long remained a mere amusement to the eye, in which the heart took no part. At length Zulma shone forth in the midst of her sisters, an image of the god she served. I saw and loved her: struggled with my passion, but could not overcome. I was soon convinced that her heart beat responsively to mine. The voice of reason and duty was listened to no longer—passion was ascendant in our bosoms—and—Rolla, you are my son!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Old man! You mock me!</P>

<SPEAKER>Rol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have I then ever communicated the throbs of transport to any human breast? My father! O this name is so new—and these feelings are so new.—O my father! Why did you so long con∣ceal yourself from a heart like mine, a heart so destitute of joy?</P>

<P>What would have been impossible to another, was to the high priest easy. You were sent, as soon as born, to my brother, the governor of a distant province, and educated as his son.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Rol.</SPEAKER>
<P>And have I indeed a father! one whose heart will sympathize with mine?—Yes, I shall yet be happy. We will fly this place, my father,—Cora and Alonzo shall accompany us, and—</P>

See this youth, full of strength and love for his native land, con∣demned to die because he is your brother—both, both murdered by the daughter's and sister's hand—and, worse than death, dragged to the grave with shame as their companion! <HI>(Cora sinks on the ground.

How did my young heart leap, while I longed to be an Alonzo! Fool that I was! His deeds were the work of chance, and himself as weak as the rest of mankind!

In climbing the lofty heights of honor, still love has been my conductor. It was my companion in the day of danger; and, in the field of battle, the only word I heard was Cora.—O Inca! shew that you have the feelings of a man!

<P>Call me what you please!—Yet, if I be an enthu∣siast, think not that I am suddenly become so. This heart was born to be the seat of mighty passions.—To the common swarm of emmets which bustle about the world, I had an aversion, even as a boy. When my play∣mates were merry and sportive around me, I played it is true, but I always found it irksome, though I never could precisely ascertain to what cause that feeling might be as∣cribed. But when storms lowered around the horizon, when our mountains vomitted forth flames at midnight, or
<PB N="76" REF="037763_0077_100F0A0CB0369B08"/>
subterraneous groanings announced an approaching earth∣quake, then my heart felt elevated; my languishing spi∣rit revived; the withered plant again reared its head. As I advanced in life, no female attractions had power to charm my eyes;—they remained stedfastly and eagerly fixed on the more brilliant rays of honor. Blinded to every beauty of Nature, my heart, my throbbing heart, burned solely to run the career of same and glory; while each victory that I obtained, far from proving an assuag∣ing drop to mitigate the flame, served only to increase its ardor.—Then it was that I saw Cora again!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>And the flame which at first burst out with a force that promised its eternal duration, was instantly ex∣tinguished!—Extinguished as a lamp by the breath of a child.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rol.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, not so!—The flame continued to burn, it only found a different species of nourishment. What was before a wild and all-consuming blaze, was changed into a gentle, genial warmth. Honor gave way to love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. P.</SPEAKER>

<P>If, therefore, thou hast any regard for me, no more of this!—My arm, my sword are devoted to thy service—I have followed thee blindly into the laby∣rinth in which we are now involved; but I must still be permitted to think, that we do not give any proof of our wisdom in groping our way here, when we might be more advantageously employed.</P>

<SPEAKER>Al.</SPEAKER>
<P>More advantageously?—let me hear in what way?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juan.</SPEAKER>
<P>He who is doing ill, may always be more ad∣vantageously employed; and by the blood of all the knights that does or does not flow in my veins, I think we are now cursedly in the wrong. I say nothing of the sword suspended by a thread over our heads—affection takes precedence of life—you love Cora—I have the strongest attachment for you, and Diego is attached to both.</P>

<P>Certainly, certainly, sir!—but—notwithstand∣ing—pray don't take it amiss, if I think that life has pre∣cedence of affection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Granted, therefore, that the prosecution of this enterprize should prove the means of shortening the du∣ration of our lives; yet we, perhaps, only give up some years of unhappiness ourselves, to purchase the happiness of a friend. And since they have lived long who have lived happily, and he only can be esteemed to have lived happily, who has died so; what better can we wish, or how can we end our lives more satisfactorily, than in of∣fering them up a sacrifice to friendship."</P>

<P><HI>(Raising his hands towards heaven.)</HI> Oh! Father above, do thou then interpose and save her! Suffer not the most perfect work upon which thy rays ever shone to be destroyed, but, to the confusion of these unfeeling priests, save her!—Oh, how could I expect to find a heart of sensibility within such a shell!—the heart that beats be∣neath those garments never can have any feeling, except for vain and senseless customs; it dissembles towards its god, and is blood-thirsty as a tyger's.</P>

<P>Oh Rolla, you know not how much you wrong me!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Carefully instructed by your fathers and mothers to pluck every flower which might lie in your way—to wring the neck of every bird which might fall into your hands—from your infancy, each avenue in your hearts has been closed against humanity; while he, who could, with the greatest composure, perform such ignoble ac∣tions, was considered as bearing in his bosom the germs of the future high priest.</P>

<SPEAKER>H. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>This from you, Rolla?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Beloved and pampered self is the sole object of your attention—beauty is to you as a blunted arrow—and love appears an absurd romance. A shake of the head is the utmost tribute you can pay to the suffering of a brother; nor does the tear of sympathy ever <HI>start</HI> into your eyes it only quivers there by compulsion. No emotion of concern would intrude into your breast, were the world itself to be laid in ruins, provided <HI>you</HI> were spared and could continue to live in ease and affluence."</P>

<P>Since she immediately began to avoid me, I saw that the effort was painful, that love and duty were at war in her bosom, and, desirous to render the conflict less severe, I determined equally to avoid her. Many months lingered on in this miserable situation, while both endured the keenest torments of hopeless passion: our cheeks grew pale; our eyes became hollow and sunk; despair reigned in every feature; till at length Zulma's weaker frame could no longer support such complicated sorrow—she was attacked with a violent illness, and lay at the point of death; while I—Rolla, you seem af∣fected!</P>

<SPEAKER>Rol.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>(Holding out his hand to him with averted eyes.)</HI> Oh, how unjust have I beean!—I am ashamed!—pardon me!—and—proceed, uncle—tell me she died!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hastened to her assistance—day and night I climbed the most rugged rocks, or ranged the forests, to seek medicinal herbs for her restoration. I summoned to∣gether the oldest priests in the kingdom who were cele∣brated for their skill in the medical science; and at length, by our unwearied exertions, the lovely Zulma was saved. She sunk in my arms overpowered with gratitude—not a word was spoken by either, we explained ourselves only by the expressive language of tears—<HI>(He appears extremely affected.)</HI> Oh, Rolla! I am now grown old, yet see how the recollection of this scene still shakes me.</P>

<P>The messenger was in great haste.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Xai.</SPEAKER>
<P>Probably the king wished to talk with him about the sentence—perhaps to consult with him on the possi∣bility of mitigating the punishment. Ah, my friends, I fear that this Inca is not eager in promoting the ven∣geance due to our offended gods. Didn't you remark with what reluctance he consented to Zorai's being put in irons?—with what compassion he looked upon the stranger?—nay, that he even degraded his dignity, so far as to speak to him?—His father was a very different sort of man!</P>

<SPEAKER>Xai.</SPEAKER>
<P>He cast down his eyes with awe, where his son looks up and smiles with thoughtless levity—exacted the strictest justice, where his son would show mercy. But who are we to condemn?—who, but his tutor?—the man to whom his education was entrusted?—in short the high priest. I will not say more now, this is neither the place nor the time for long harangues; however, I know his principles. Take heed!—be on your guard!—"</P>

<P>And would you then sanction the licentious con∣duct that must inevitably ensue, should indulgence be shewn in the present instance?</P>

<P>At the source of a clear stream, we do not think of the mud by which it may be contaminated in its

course. I entreat you, let us be true to our vocation, let us resemble the god whom we serve, whose rays dif∣fuse light and heat over all! Let us acquit Cora!—It will then lie in the king's bosom to act as he shall judge right, either by confirming or reversing our sentence; and should it be reversed, we shall, at least, have done our duty, in shewing a disposition to clemency, while the hapless victim will breathe her last sighs in gratitude for our intended mercy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Xai.</SPEAKER>
<P>What would you require of me?—You speak as if the decision of this point rested upon me alone. Are not you high priest?—Do not the duties of your office demand that you lay the case before the whole assembly of the priests, in which I have but a single voice?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know well, that in representing this affair to the assembly, I am forbidden by our laws to employ any persuasions of eloquence—what I am to say, must be expressed in the fewest and simplest words; and I am, therefore, precluded from the power of influencing the auditors. You, it is true, have only one voice; but you are the oldest of the order, next to me, and successor to the high priesthood at my death. To you, therefore, all the young priests, look up, and will incline which way soever they shall see you inclined.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Xai.</SPEAKER>
<P>This case may be rightly stated as to what con∣cerns yourself, but it is otherwise with the Inca, who has always power to grant a pardon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>But when has this power been exercised?—Has not every Inca, from father to son, for centuries past, uniformly confirmed the sentence of the priests?—Will Ataliba, think you, venture to deviate from the practice of his ancestors?"</P>
