<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH they who are departed hence in the Lord, can receive no ad∣dition to their happiness by any testimonial of their surviving friends, however just; yet to the wise in heart, precious is the memory of the truly pious and upright, whose hum∣ble walking in the fear of God has livingly witnessed against the appearance of evil in its various transformations; their confor∣mity in spirit and practice to the holy law of the Lord, evincing the delight and be∣nefit to be found therein; for
<Q>Verily there is a reward for the righteous, verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.</Q>
Psalm lviii, verse 11.</P>
<P><Q>What scene in this life more dignifies humanity? what school is more profita∣bly instructive than the death-bed of the righteous, impressing the understanding with a convincing evidence, that they have not followed cunningly devised fa∣bles, but solid substantial truth; that there is a measure of divine light and grace in man, which if duly minded and obeyed, is sufficient to preserve thro' all the vicissitudes in life, to give him the vic∣tory
<PB N="iv" REF="020377_0003_0FAF095CB99800D8"/>
over his spiritual enemies, and in the end over death, hell, and the grave?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of James Gough, page 53.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>It is right therefore, that the remembrance of those should be preserved, whose lights have so shone before men as to excite the beholders of their good works to glorify God, the original, and source from whom all good is derived, that tho' being dead, the lustre of their pious example through life, and on the approach of death, may con∣tinue to speak the inviting language,
<Q>Fol∣low us as we have followed Christ.</Q></P>
<P>With this view, our yearly-meeting con∣sidering that many memorials of our depart∣ed friends lay dormant on the records, di∣rected a Collection to be made of such of them as were most likely to be of general benefit by publication, which the committee appointed for the service having performed to the best of their judgment, it is now pre∣sented to the readers, some of whom will be reminded of the sincere piety and virtue of their ancestors, who through the dangers and difficulties to which they were subjected, in their removal from their native land, and forming a new settlement in a wilderness, were happily preserved in a steady attention to their religious duty, and many of them faithfully engaged in promoting the cause of truth and righteousness among mankind, to whom others succeeded, who through obedience to the powerful influence of Di∣vine grace, became alike eminent in their day, and serviceable in the church.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="020377_0004_0FAF095D73C33498"/>The following Collection is affectionately recommended to the descendants of those worthies, to the readers in general, and particularly to the youth, who may derive profitable instruction by a serious observa∣tion of the happy effects of an early devoti∣on of heart, and the inexpressible advant∣ages of embracing the merciful visitation of the Most-High, to secure their true comfort in this life, and enduring felicity in that which is to come.</P>
<P>Though the language and style of these memorials may not be calculated to please such curious readers who in their estimate of the value of a Book, are too much amus∣ed by the display of wit and literary accom∣plishments in the composition, to give due attention to the instructive import of an art∣less account of the christian experiences of those, who have not been so solicitous for the approbation of men, as to be found humble followers of Christ, their meek and lowly pattern and redeemer; but it is hop∣ed, that there are many to whom the con∣tents of this Collection will afford informa∣tion, edification, and encouragement in the pursuit of their most substantial interest, a life of true wisdom, piety, and virtue; and that the number of such may increase is the design of the following publication.</P>

<HEAD>A COLLECTION OF MEMORIALS or TESTIMONIES CONCERNING Divers MINISTERS and ELDERS deceased.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="testimony">
<HEAD>An abstract of <HI>Nicholas Waln's</HI> Testimony, concerning that faithful servant of the Lord, <HI>CUTHBERT HAYHURST,</HI> who departed this life, at his own house in the county of <HI>Bucks,</HI> in <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> about the <HI>5</HI>th of the first month, <HI>1682-3,</HI> near the fiftieth year of his age.</HEAD>
<P>HE was born at Easington, in Bolland in the county of York, in Old England, and was one of the worthies in Israel. My spirit is comforted in a sense of that power, which did attend him in our meetings, for many years in the land of our nativity, and also after he came into these parts; having been a valiant soldier for the truth, and bore a faithful testimony to the same, in
<PB N="2" REF="020377_0009_0FAF0963453129A0"/>
word, life and conversation. He went through many great exercises and imprisonments, and was a comfort unto the faithful and true believers, who <HI>follow the Lamb through many tribulations.</HI> He was a worthy instru∣ment in the Lord's hand, against the false teachers and hirelings, going several times to their steeple-houses, and testifying against their deceiving the people. He also went to several market towns, and at their crosses, declared and published the truth as it is in Jesus: I accompanied him and his dear wife at one of them, where he faithfully warned the people and exhorted them to repentance; the divine power and presence eminently at∣tending him, which my soul was made sen∣sible of to my comfort and satisfaction. I can say he was of great service to me and many others, being instrumental in bring∣ing us near unto the Lord, whose name over all we have cause to bless on his behalf; and although his body is gone to the earth, his memorial liveth among the righteous, and I am persuaded his soul is in the enjoyment of peace with the Lord. I was often with him in the time of his sick∣ness, and beheld his meek, innocent and lamb-like deportment; being also by his bed-side when he departed, which was in a quiet and truly resigned frame, like one fall∣ing into a sweet sleep; so that I have great cause to believe he is one of those <HI>that died in the Lord, and is at rest with him forever.</HI></P>

<P>HE was one of the Lord's worthies, strong and steadfast in the faith, very zealous for the truth and careful for the church; his life being hid with God in Christ. His ministry stood not in the wisdom of the flesh, but in the power of God. It was the birth born from above, that could receive him and was refreshed by him. In a word, he was a Jew inward whose praise is not of men but of God. And forasmuch as he was a man thus qualified, I could not well be satisfied that so worthy a man as dear Christopher Taylor, should be buried in ob∣livion. His chiefest joy was to feel friends in the invisible life; and although many exer∣cises did attend him for the truth's sake, he was <HI>faithful unto the death, and so has receiv∣ed a crown of life</HI>; and though his departure from us is our loss, yet it is his gain; for <HI>blessed are the dead which die in the Lord, they rest from their labours and their works do fol∣low them.</HI></P>

<P>It appears our said friend came from Old England, his native country, on a religious visit to New England, in the year 1675; af∣terwards into Pennsylvania, among the first English, and settled at Philadelphia. He was

<P>HE was born at Longworth, near Bolton in Lancashire. We were well acquaint∣ed with him almost from the time of his convincement, being a man of a peaceable disposition, gentle and mild, ready and will∣ing to serve his friend to the utmost of his ability, and a very diligent labourer in the work of the Lord, willing to spend and be spent, not counting any thing in this world too dear to part with, for the same. The Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id eminently bless his ministry, where∣unto he was called about the year 1672, and travelled sometimes in that work, in his own country until 1675; after which time he was wholly given up and devoted to the service of the Lord, travelling much in England, where he suffered imprison∣ment in several places; six times he passed through Holland, and some others of those provinces; also part of Germany and there∣about, several times as far as Dantzick, where he laboured much for the release of
<PB N="5" REF="020377_0012_0FAF0965526D6C28"/>
friends, who then were prisoners there, writ∣ing to the king, magistrates and officers on their behalf. At Embden, where friends were sufferers, he laboured for their freedom, and it being a time of hot persecution, went through the streets, warning the people to repent of their wickedness, where they kept him two nights a prisoner: At another time in the said place, he delivered a paper to the council, relating to the liberty of friends; after the reading whereof, he was called in to the council room and received in a friend∣ly manner, with promises of freedom to the people called Quakers, in matters of faith and worship; he also had good service with magistrates, lawyers, priests and collegians, and was several times a prisoner in those parts. Five times he passed through Ireland, visiting friends, where he had good service, sometimes among the Irish when at mass. Once he passed through part of Scotland, twice at Barbados, once through New En∣gland and Virginia, twice in Maryland and the Jerseys, and twice at Pennsylvania; hav∣ing travelled by land above 20,000 miles, his travels by water, not being much less: And though he was often in storms and tempests at sea, perils by land, and met with bad spirits and exercises of divers kinds, yet the Lord stood by him and made him a successful instrument in his hand: Cheerfully passing through them all, by the power of him that called him thereto, not being slack to labour in word and doc∣trine,

wherever he came, to the edifying of the brethren, and reconciling things where he found them amiss: Settling and esta∣blishing meetings in many parts where he came, to the great comfort and refreshment of the upright in heart, by which he got a name amongst the ancients, and is recorded among the worthies of the Lord. Not long after his arrival in Pennsylvania, he was taken ill with a fever; his distemper was violent upon him, yet he bore it patiently and passed away like a lamb, leaving a good savour. And though <HI>the name of the wicked shall rot, yet the righteous shall be had in ever∣lasting remembrance.</HI></P>

Having experienced the work of regeneration in himself, he be∣came qualified to strengthen the brethren, and went forth in the ministry and word of life, preaching the everlasting gospel of Christ Jesus; having freely received he free∣ly gave, not fearing man but obeying God, who had committed a large measure, and clear manifestation of his spirit unto him, not only for his own profit and benefit, but many others received comfort thereby; for his doctrine dropped as the rain, and his speech distilled as the dew, to the renewing and refreshing the seed and plant of God.</P>
<P>Thus he went forth in the name of the Lord, and was valiant for truth upon earth; and though many weapons were formed, and many tongues rose up against him, yet the divine power which stopped the mouths of lions, and quenched the violence of fire, girded him with strength and valour, where∣by he was enabled to encounter all his ene∣mies, and such as endeavoured to stop the work which God has begun in the earth. After some time, he with his wife and two children came into this country, and whilst here, he bore a living, sound and faithful testimony for the Lord God, to the great satisfaction and comfort of the faithful in this wilderness, where his lot did fall. For having had the opportunity of being with

After he was taken sick, he grew weaker until his departure, saying "The will of the Lord be done." His short continuance here caused many to mourn when he was taken from them, yet not as those that mourn without hope, for tho' he be dead, yet he lives, and tho' his removal is our loss, it is his gain.</P>

In 1682 we came into this country, with one consent, and in the unity of our dear friends and brethren, who gave a good testimony for us, by a certificate from their monthly meeting; and my soul hath good cause to bless the Lord, and to prize his mercies, whose presence was with us by sea and land.

He was a tender husband, ready to encourage and strengthen me in that which is good. About the latter end of the fifth month 1687, he was taken with the ague and fever, which much weakned his body, in which he con∣tinued a considerable time; being well con∣tent with the dealings of the Lord: His heart was often opened in prayer and sup∣plication unto his God, to preserve him in patience unto the end of his days, and that none of us might think hard of any of those exercises that he is pleased to try us withal.

But this my friend received the truth with a ready mind and gladness of heart, and thought nothing too dear to part with for it, yea it was precious to him as <HI>the pearl of great price,</HI> and it wrought effectually in him, not only in opening his understanding, but also in its various operations, both to wound and to heal, to purge out the old leaven and to leaven anew into its holy nature and qua∣lity: And as the Lord had made him a living witness of the power and life of truth in himself, he called him to bear a testimo∣ny to the truth as he had received it, and also against the false ways and worships that were then extant in the world; for which he suffered several imprisonments, bearing the burden and heat of the day, being one of the first that received and bore witness to the truth in those parts. He was very serviceable in his public testimony, not on∣ly in convincing but also to the edification of many; yea he was a great stay and sup∣port to friends in the parts near where he lived: For he was an instrument of great service in the Lord's hand, being much esteemed for his works sake, not only at home but in other places where he travelled in truth's service.</P>

In short, as he was a sensible, so he was a serviceable mem∣ber of the body, having a sense of and share in whatever tended to the strength and benefit thereof; as on the other hand, if any thing happened that caused grief or trouble, he bore his part of it.</P>
<P>He was a man of sound judgment and good understanding, not being drawn aside by any false spirit that hath risen in our day, nor joined with any that broke forth into separation, or sought to divide or make schisms in the body, either in England or America.

<HEAD>A Testimony from the Monthly-Meeting of <HI>Haverford</HI> in <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> concerning THOMAS LLOYD.</HEAD>
<P>THE love of God and the regard we have to the blessed truth, constrains us to give forth this testimony, concerning our dear friend Thomas Lloyd, many of us having had long acquaintance with him, both in Wales, where he formerly lived, and also in Pennsylvania, where he finished his course, and laid down his head in peace with the Lord, and is at rest and joy with him for∣evermore.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="020377_0029_0FAF09764B903868"/>He was by birth of them who are called the gentry, his father being a man of a considerable estate and of great esteem in his time, of an ancient house and estate called Dolobran, in Montgomeryshire in Wales. He was brought up at the most noted schools, and from thence went to one of the universities; and because of his su∣perior, natural and acquired parts, many of account in the world had an eye of re∣gard towards him: Being offered degrees and places of preferments, he refused them all: The Lord beginning his work in him, and causing a measure of his light to shine out of darkness, in his heart, which gave him a sight of the vain forms, customs and tra∣ditions of the schools and colleges: And hearing of a poor despised people called Quakers, he went to hear them, and the Lord's power reached unto him and came over him, to the humbling and bowing his heart and spirit; so that he was convinced of God's everlasting truth, and received it in the love of it, and was made willing, like meek Moses, to choose rather to suffer affliction with the people of the Lord, than the honours, preferments and riches of this world. The earthly wisdom came to be of no reputation with him, but he became a fool, both to it and his former associates, and through self denial, and taking up the daily cross of Christ Jesus, which crucified his natural will, affections and pleasures, he came to be a scholar in Christ's school,
<PB N="23" REF="020377_0030_0FAF0976F0395E10"/>
and to learn the true wisdom which is from above. Thus by departing from the vani∣ties and iniquities of the world, and follow∣ing the leadings, guidance and instructions of the divine light, grace and spirit of Christ, he came more and more to have an understanding in the mysteries of God's kingdom, and was made an able minister of the everlasting gospel of peace and salvation; his acquired parts being sanctified to the service of truth.</P>
<P>His sound and effectual ministry, his godly conversation, meek and lamb-like spirit, great patience, temperance, humility, and slowness to wrath; his love to the bre∣thren, his godly care in the church of Christ, that all things might be kept sweet, savoury and in good order; his helping hand to the weak, and gentle admonitions, we are fully satisfied have a seal and witness in the hearts of all faithful friends who knew him, both in the land of his nativity and in these American parts. We may in truth say, he sought not himself, nor the riches of this world, but his eye was to that which is everlasting, being given up to spend and be spent for the truth and the sake of friends.</P>
<P>He never turned his back on the truth, nor was weary in his travels Sion-wards, but remained a sound pillar in the spiritual building. He had many disputes with the clergy and some called peers in England, and also suffered imprisonments and much loss of outward substance, to the honour of

truth, and stopping in measure, the mouths of gainsayers and persecutors. Yet these ex∣ercises and trials in the land of his nativity, which he sustained through the ability God gave him, were small and not to be com∣pared to the many and great exercises, griefs and sorrows he met withal and went thro' in Pennsylvania, from that miserable apo∣state George Keith and his deluded compa∣ny. Oh the revilings, the great provocati∣ons, the bitter and wicked language, and rude behaviour which the Lord gave him patience to bear and overcome. He reviled not again, nor took any advantage, but loved his enemies, and prayed for them that despitefully abused him. His love to the Lord, his truth and people was sincere to the last. He was taken with a malignant fever, the 5<HI>th</HI> of the seventh month 1694, and tho' his bodily pain was great, he bore it with much patience. Not long before his departure, some friends being with him, he said,
<Q>Friends, I love you all, I am go∣ing from you, and I die in unity and love with all faithful friends: I have fought a good fight and kept the faith, which stands not in the wisdom of words, but in the power of God: I have fought, not for strife and contention, but for the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the simplicity of the gospel. I lay down my head in peace and desire you may all do so; friends, farewell all.</Q>
He further said to Griffith Owen, a friend then intending for
<PB N="25" REF="020377_0032_0FAF0978CECC6FD8"/>
England,
<Q>I desire thee to mind my love to friends in England, if thou lives to go over to see them; I have lived in unity with them, and do end my days in unity with them; and desire the Lord to keep them all faithful to the end, in the simplicity of the gospel.</Q>
On the 10<HI>th</HI> day of the seventh month aforesaid, being the 6<HI>th</HI> day of his sick∣ness, it pleased the Lord to remove him from the many trials, temptations, sorrows and troubles of this world, to the kingdom of ever∣lasting joy and peace; but the remembrance of his innocent life and meek spirit lives with us, and his memorial is, and will remain to be sweet and comfortable to the faithful.</P>
<P>He was buried in friends burial-ground in Philadelphia, aged about forty-five years, having been several years president and de∣puty governor of Pennsylvania.</P>

loved and highly esteemed him for his works sake, being an able minister of the gospel, sound in doctrine, endowed with wisdom and a ready utterance; and favour'd with openings into the mysteries of the things of God's kingdom. He was not forward to offer his gift, having a true regard to the giver, who said formerly, "Cast the net on the right side of the ship:" Therefore his "Bow abode in strength." And tho' the Lord had furnished him with such excellent qualifications, he had so learned self-denial as not to glory therein; but was ready to prefer his friends before himself, and give them the right hand of fellowship; being careful to keep the testimony of truth clear on all accounts, saying, "Those that ap∣pear in public, are doubly bound so to do." He was of a cheerful and peaceable temper, and innocent and blameless in life. As the Lord had bestowed on him a gift of the ministry, beyond many of his fellows, so he was careful to improve it to his honour and the comfort of his people, labouring therein, not only here in Pennsylvania and New-Jersey, but he also several times visit∣ed the churches in New-England, Rhode-Island, Long-Island and Maryland, and lastly he went on that service to Old-En∣gland, where he finished his course. And tho' our loss of him is great, we are satis∣fied he hath his portion, among <HI>those that turn many to righteousness, and shine as the stars forever and ever.</HI></P>

In 1683 he came with his family into Pennsylvania: And in 1695 he went in company with Griffith Owen, to visit his brethren in England; where, in the course of his travels, he was taken ill at Hitchin; and two of his relations from Cheshire, going thither to visit him, he said to one of them,
<Q>It is some exercise to think of being taken away so far from my home and family, and also from my friends and relations in Cheshire. My care hath been for my sons, that they may be kept in the fear of God: I have been a good example to them. I have a care upon me, that they may be kept humble while they are young, that they may bend their necks under the yoke of Christ. If I am taken away, I am very clear in my spirit, I have answered the requir∣ings of God. I have been faithful in my day, and I have nothing that troubles my spirit; my spirit is very clear.</Q>
He also expressed his concern for his brethren of the ministry, especially the young, that they might observe the leadings of God's spirit in their ministry, and not lean upon their own natural parts. After this, he re∣covered

so as to be able to get down into Cheshire; but after some time his disorder returning, he said to his sister,
<Q>If it be the will of God, that I be taken away now, I am well content.</Q>
He departed in much quietness of mind, the 12<HI>th</HI> of the twelfth month 1696, and was buried the 15<HI>th</HI> of the same month, in friends bury∣ing place in Cheshire. Aged sixty-three years. A public minister 41 years.</P>

<P>WHEN I think of former times and days that are over and gone, where∣in the Lord visited a remnant by the gather∣ing hand of his power, in the land of our nativity, to wait for the renewing of his love from one meeting to another, to our great refreshment and daily encouragement, to run our race through many trials within and without: The Lord whom we waited for, hath been the strength of his people in this our age and generation, as in all by past ages. So the remembrance of those days and times, and that near fellowship which was between the little remnant in that part of the country, is at present brought to my view; tho' most of the ancients that bore the heat of the day are now removed, yet methinks their names and worthy acts should be had in remembrance, that gene∣rations to come might see and understand, by what instruments the Lord was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eased to carry on his work, by making <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar discovery of the good way on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ost <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the night of apostacy; amongst whom were my dear friends Robert Owen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> his wife.

<P><PB N="33" REF="020377_0040_0FAF097FF0AB2310"/>He was descended of a very ancient and (according to the worlds account) one of the greatest families in those parts, having by his father a competent inheritance, and in all his time had the right hand among his equals; brought up a scholar, quick in apprehension, and whatever he took in hand he did it with all his might. He was zeal∣ously devoted to religion, and a great search∣er for the pearl of great price; being one of the first in our parts who sought after it; and having found it, he sold all to purchase the same.</P>
<P>After King Charles II came to the crown, he suffered five years close imprisonment, for not taking the oath of allegiance and supremacy, being confined at the town of Dolgelly, in Merionethshire, North Wales, within about a mile from his dwell∣ing house, to which he was not permitted to go during the said time: And it was ob∣served, that the person who had the great∣est hand in prosecuting him, was visited with sickness, when remorse of conscience seized so hard upon him, that he could find neither rest nor ease, until he sent a special messenger to release him.</P>

<P>TRUTH in the inward parts God loves, and those that love it and give way to the operation thereof, are made precious and lovely in the sight of God, and he makes them instrumental in his hand for the good of others; among whom was my dear friend and brother Hugh Roberts de∣ceased, who was qualified by God's power, to be a serviceable instrument to the church∣es of Christ in our parts of America. He came to this country about 18 years since; we were near neighbours and entirely loved each other, not having had a cross word, nor I believe an hard thought one of ano∣ther, at any time since our first acquaint∣ance.
<PB N="35" REF="020377_0042_0FAF0981A3702C90"/>
Having passed through many trials and exercises, he could by experience speak a word in season for the encouragement of weary travellers; his doctrine often "drop∣ping as the dew, and distilling as the small rain upon the tender plants," for in the openings of life, "things new and old" came forth of the treasury of wisdom, which gladned our hearts and comforted our spi∣rits in a sense of God's love, who is the author of all good to his people. He was zealous for good order in the church, ser∣viceable in the discipline, and skilful in ac∣commodating differences. And it is my de∣sire, that we, especially of that meeting he belonged to, and the adjacent meetings, which mostly received the benefit and ad∣vantage of his labour of love, may lay to heart and consider our loss of him, and in the sense thereof, may breathe and cry un∣to the Lord, who is the repairer of breach∣es, to raise up instruments in his room, for carrying on of his great work that he hath begun in the earth, to his own praise, who is alone worthy of the same forever.— I was twice with him over sea, and in many places in our native land, also in Maryland, and in his last journey to visit friends on Long-Island, Rhode-Island and New-Eng∣land, where he had good service. And though he was often very weakly, yet his heart was bent to accomplish the work the Lord laid upon him, which he was enabled to perform to his great comfort and satis∣faction.</P>

His persecutors at different times, distrain∣ed from him to the amount of several hun∣dred pounds sterling, for preaching; taking nineteen cattle at one time, and twelve at another, besides corn, cheese, and other goods; all which he bore patiently. Once when they were driving away his cows, his servant maid, who did not profess amongst friends, said to him, "Master, how can you stand by and see them drive away so many cattle?"

<P>In the time of his last sickness, he appear'd to be in a heavenly frame of mind, and ut∣ter'd many lively expressions: At one time he said,

And now I may say in truth, that I have kept this living faith, in which my soul hath renewed cause to magnify the name of my holy Redeemer, and powerful Saviour Christ Jesus, in whom my faith hath been made strong at this time.</Q>
The day before his departure, his wife and son, with some other friends be∣ing present, he bore a living testimony to the

Being taking sick, he was visited by many friends; and about two d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ys before his departure, being asked how he did, he answered,
<Q>I am very poorly and weak indeed, but much easier than I have been, for I was extreme ill, so sick and full of pain, such as I never had under∣gone before; so tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I could not retire in my mind to God, my extremity was so great; but now the Lord has been pleas∣ed to give me ease, so that I can stay my mind on him, for which I am truly thank∣ful: And now I feel the fresh remem∣brance or renewings of the love of God,

Shortly after, a friend taking leave of him, asked him if he thought he should recover,
<Q>That (said he) I am not worthy to know, however I am con∣tent; and this I know, that if we abide faithful to God to the end, we shall re∣ceive a godly portion, so farewell, and the Lord go along with thee.</Q>
At ano∣ther time he said,

Afterwards adding,
<Q>Do not mourn for me, but be still and quiet, and let me pass away quietly, that so my soul may enter into God's everlasting rest; for my conscience is clear from guilt in the face of all men.</Q>
Saying,

<Q>If the Lord has any more work for me to do, he can raise me up again; otherwise I am easy and freely resigned to his will.</Q>
To a beloved relation she said,
<Q>Dear cousin, thou art bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh; live in the fear of the Lord, that every high thought may be brought down.</Q>
To two friends belonging to a distant meeting which she had often visited, she said,
<Q>I have not ceased to admonish you heretofore, and now again desire you would be valiant for the truth and walk steadily therein, and remember my dear love to friends of the meeting to which you belong.</Q>
She often spoke to friends,

<HEAD>An account of <HI>ELLIS PUGH,</HI> extracted from a testimony from <HI>Gwynedd</HI> Monthly-Meeting concerning him, and also from a short sum∣mary of his life, both of which are prefixed to a book he wrote, called <HI>A salutation to the Britons,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>ELLIS PUGH was born in the parish of Dolgelly, in the county of Merion∣eth, and dominion of Wales, in the sixth month 1656. His parents were religious people; but his father died before he was born, and his mother a few days after. In the days of his youth, when going with the multitude into folly, it pleased God by his judgment, to stand in his way, and caused him to consider the things that be∣longed to his soul's everlasting peace. And in the eighteenth year of his age, the Lord visited him more eminently, kindling a zeal in him to serve his Creator more diligently; having been also reached by the testimony of John-ap-John, one of the people called Quakers.</P>
<P>God who promised to be a father to the fatherless, took care of him; and about the year 1680, gave him a part in the ministry of the gospel of Christ, (notwithstanding he was not one of the wise of this world, nor had human learning) yet he was made a profitable instrument to turn divers from vanity, and to exhort and strengthen many
<PB N="49" REF="020377_0056_0FAF098EF376F510"/>
in their spiritual journey, in his native land, and also in this country where he finished his course.</P>
<P>In the year 1686, he and his family, with divers of his acquaintance prepared to come over to Pennsylvania, and whilst they wait∣ed for the ship to be ready, there came great trouble and exercise upon him, so that he was sick for some days; in which strait the Lord shewed him, that they should meet with troubles and exercises in their way, and that he had a work for him in that country, and must return again to his native land. After they sailed, they met with storms, straits and troubles; and having been upon the tempestuous sea all winter, they arrived at Barbados, where they were joyfully and lovingly received by their friends, and the summer following, in the year 1687, they arrived in Pennsylvania; where this our friend was a serviceable instrument in the Lord's hand, to cherish and instruct us, in meekness and tendern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss, to obey that which God made known unto us of his will, and to follow and understand the operation of his spirit, discovering to us the snares of the enemy of our souls. His pious labours (among others that were fitted for the same service) have been profitable in directing and edifying us in the way of truth; for by the tenderness and influence which came as dew upon our souls while we sat under his ministry, we believed his doctrine was of God.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="020377_0057_0FAF098FCF685218"/>In the year 1706 he was engaged to visit the inhabitants of his native country, ac∣cording to what the Lord revealed unto him before he came from thence; which service he performed to the benefit and acceptance of many, and returned to his family in 1708. After he came home, three of his children, in the flower of their age, who from their youth walked orderly and were hopeful, died within one month; in the time of which trial the Lord was near un∣to him; he mourned not as one without hope. Strength was given him to bear his affliction. He said in a public meeting "If he could bear his affliction acceptably in the sight of God, it would be as marrow to his bones:" Which testimony, amongst several other things, was to the edification and comfort of the hearers. His residence was then nearer to us than before, which render'd his life and conversation more con∣spicuous, and his fellowship more known unto us. His ministry was living, profit∣able and to edification. He was of a meek and quiet spirit, considerate and solid in his judgment, of few words, honest and care∣ful in his calling; and several were induced to speak of the benefit they received by his chaste conversation, and his loving and com∣fortable expressions while he was amongst them in their families. He was honourable among his friends and of good report among all people generally, therefore his memory will not soon wear out.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="020377_0058_0FAF0990BA2C3A28"/>He was in a declining state of bodily health about a year and three months before his decease, so that he was not well able to follow his calling; but his candle shined brighter, as may be seen by perusing his treatise, called
<Q>A salutation to the Bri∣tains;</Q>
which he wrote in his own lan∣guage, in the time of his long sickness, when his view was towards that which pertains to eternity, more especially to those, or for the sake of those to whom the salutation of his life reached over sea and land, for the encouragement and instruction of them that were seeking the way to Sion, the New Je∣rusalem, the city of the Great King, whose walls and bulwarks are salvation.</P>
<P>The last meeting he was at among us, he was weak in body, but fervent in spirit, as one taking his last leave in a great deal of love and tenderness, saying, that the Lord granted him his desire to come and visit us once more; putting us in mind to live in love and unity, and to keep out from amongst us as much as we could, all strife and dis∣cord; and when any thing appeared which had a tendency thereunto, that hands should be laid without delay to end it, and that none should depend upon his own hand, eye, or balance in judgment.—He was fit∣ted to counsel others, because his life and conversation was answerable to his testimo∣ny; amongst his family tender and careful to counsel them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in the fear of God.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="020377_0059_0FAF09912D4F8878"/>We looked upon him as one who had finished his work, that the time of his dis∣solution drew nigh: And that he might say in the words of Paul, according to his mea∣sure,
<Q>I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith. Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day; and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.</Q></P>
<P>Being patient in his tedious indisposition, and contented to wait the Lord's time; he slept with his fathers on the 3<HI>d</HI> day of the tenth month 1718, in favour with God.</P>

<HEAD>The following Testimony concerning <HI>WILLIAM HAIG,</HI> was furnished by a committee of the Yearly-Meeting of <HI>North-Carolina.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WILLIAM HAIG senior of Pasquo∣tank county, who removed from Antigua with his family and settled in this province, was of a loving and sweet spirit. In his last sickness, as some friends were sit∣ting by him, he was filled with heavenly joy, and said,
<Q>Friends I am glad of your company, I feel so much of the blessed truth, as I hope will carry me into that joy where I shall praise the Lord amongst the redeemed. I hear that truth prospers mightily in England, blessed be the Lord
<PB N="53" REF="020377_0060_0FAF0993A9FAEAF0"/>
for it.</Q>
He exhorted all his children with many heavenly expressions, took his solemn leave of them, and in a living sense of truth, prayed to God for his blessing upon them; charging them
<Q>to love and obey their mother, learn their books and keep to the truth.</Q>
He said to his wife,
<Q>My dear, thou hast been a true wife unto me; when my mind was drawn to love thee, I did not inquire what thou hadst, nor thou what I had, but we came together in love and we have lived in love.</Q>
And when his speech was very low, he spake to hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wife thus,
<Q>The Lord bless thee and my children, God Almighty protect you.</Q>
To a young woman who came to visit him he said,
<Q>Fear God, keep to the truth, never turn thy back upon it, lest the days come in which thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them: As for me, I am going to my place, and I hope it will be in ever∣lasting rest.</Q>
To another who had been visited with great sickness, he said,
<Q>It had been better for thee to have died in thy sickness, than to live to forget God.</Q>
He prayed that God would remember all his people, and that their dwelling might be with the Lord, adding,
<Q>But what shall I say, there are too many that tread the testimony of truth under foot; O! gather them into thy fold of rest, I pray thee O Lord!</Q>
To a friend of the ministry he said,
<Q>Thou art of the ministry and hast been a great while, and I am but
<PB N="54" REF="020377_0061_0FAF0994B4BC9088"/>
young, but. I would advise thee to be careful in thy testimony, not to enlarge beyond thy gift or concern; and have a care, thou do not stand in the way of others, or speak any thing to hurt others that may be but small or tender; but wait until thou art filled and then be humble, and not puffed up with pride, for pride goeth before a fall.</Q>
After praying unto the Lord to settle him upon the sure foundation and rock that can never be removed, he quietly departed this life, at his own house, on the 6<HI>th</HI> of the eleventh month 1718, and now rests in joy.</P>

<HEAD>A Testimony from the same committee concerning <HI>MARY HAIG,</HI> wife of the aforesaid <HI>Wil∣liam Haig.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SHE was a woman of an exemplary life and conversation, of a sweet and loving behaviour, and was favoured with a gift in the ministry. In her last sickness, after im∣parting her mind to a friend about her out∣ward concerns, she spoke as follows,
<Q>Ac∣cording to my small gift, I have discharg∣ed myself, so that nothing lieth at my door. O! that the people would remember the words that I have spoken among them, and that this young generation would come up in truth. As for me, I had ne∣ver left the island of Antigua, if it were
<PB N="55" REF="020377_0062_0FAF0994F95834D0"/>
not that I might have my poor children amongst faithful friends: I have seen the wonders of the Lord in the deep ocean, and witnessed his delivering arm in many exercises, and he hath kept me sweet and clean all along since I knew the truth. Oh! that my children may remember the advice they have received of their father and me; I am clear, having done my duty.</Q>
And praised God; also uttered many sweet and comfortable expressions. At another time, she said to some friends,
<Q>When I was but nine years old, the Lord made himself known unto me, but I then lived where there were no friends; and after some time, I went to Pennsylvania, and there met with friends, but some were loose and light, others were solid and weighty, and with these I joined, and received much benefit from the family of the Lloyd's. After I was married, we went to Antigua, and there in the first meeting, the power of the Lord was great∣ly with me, insomuch that the peoples expectations were upon me for words; but soon after it pleased the Lord to send two of his servants, Josiah Langdale and Thomas Thomson, to visit the island, when the power of the Lord did break in upon me like thunder:</Q>
And signified she had been faithful ever since in her mea∣sure, in giving up to the work of the Lord. On the day of her decease, she said to some present,
<Q>Friends, be loving one to ano∣ther,
<PB N="56" REF="020377_0063_0FAF0995ADD40288"/>
that the Lord may bless you. The love that I feel in my heart is inexpres∣sible.</Q>
After a while she desired a friend to remember her love to Lydia Lancaster, Elizabeth Rawlinson and friends generally, adding,
<Q>Tell them, I die in unity with all faithful friends.</Q>
Afterwards she said,
<Q>My husband is gone, but I shall not be long a sorrowful widow; yet not my will but thine be done; my speech fails apace, sweet Lord Jesus, thou hast loved me from a child, and I have loved thee ever since I knew thee, and my case is no doubtful case, I come, I come, hasten thou my journey.</Q></P>

<HEAD>A Testimony from the aforesaid committee, con∣cerning <HI>JOSEPH GLAISTER.</HI></HEAD>
<P>JOSEPH GLAISTER of Pasquotank county, formerly of Cumberland in Great-Britain, who removed with his fami∣ly and settled in North-Carolina, was a valuable minister, and very serviceable in discipline, being well qualified therefor; a constant attender of meetings with his fami∣ly, and one who travelled much for the spreading of truth. In his last sickness, he said to some friends that visited him,
<Q>I am very ill, but am out of all doubt of
<PB N="57" REF="020377_0064_0FAF099674C5CBD0"/>
my salvation, being well assured of it.</Q>
Two other friends coming in, he added,
<Q>Now I think I have most of the chief friends about me that I desired; dear friends, give me up freely, that I may not be kept longer in misery, for I can say with one of old, Lord I have long wait∣ed for thy salvation, and now have an assurance of it, and altho' the pains are great, yet the comfort and pleasure I see before me do outbalance them all.</Q>
— Again he said,
<Q>He hoped that friends might keep their places in being faithful, and not to shrink one from another when troubles or differences may arise in the church, or amongst neighbours, by any evil spirit that may get into any unfaith∣ful one, for want of a due, true and faith∣ful watch; and then if any such thing do happen, pray friends, I hope that such as now are, or may then be, do stand firm together, and give judgment in or by a living, fresh and divine spirit, and keep constant in mind, and thereby the trans∣gressor or transgressors may be judged down and not able to resist; but if you see in them any thing tender, then dear friends, turn to them with bowels of love and perhaps in so doing, you may gain such as in time past may have gone astray.</Q>
He went on speaking of the great love and unity, and the many good times he had had with us; having his spirit borne up by the ancient arm that had been from time to time
<PB N="58" REF="020377_0065_0FAF099766978440"/>
his great support. Near his end, we were sensible of his being engaged in prayer, but being almost spent we could not hear every word so as to pen it down. Thus this good man ended his life, with a sense of the great love of God to his soul, on the 31<HI>st</HI> of the eleventh month 1718, aged about forty-five years, and a minister about 24 years.</P>

<HEAD>A Testimony from <HI>Kennet</HI> Monthly-Meeting in <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> concerning <HI>VINCENT CALD∣WELL.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HE was born in Derbyshire Great-Bri∣tain, and was convinced about the 17<HI>th</HI> or 18<HI>th</HI> year of his age, by the mini∣stry of John Gratton; having received the truth in the love of it and continuing faith∣ful, the Lord was pleased to commit to him a dispensation of the gospel, so that he had to declare to others of the goodness of God to his soul. He came over into Pennsyl∣vania, and after his marriage settled in East Marlborough in Chester county. His mi∣nistry was sound and edifying, being at∣tended with the power of truth and adorn∣ed with an exemplary conversation; in the exercise whereof he twice visited the meet∣ings of friends in the southern provinces, and once in divers of the West-India islands, where he was made instrumental to the con∣vincing of many; for tho' he had but little
<PB N="59" REF="020377_0066_0FAF099816D4FC68"/>
school-learning, yet being as a good Scribe, well instructed unto the kingdom, did at times bring forth out of the treasury things new and old.</P>
<P>His last sickness continued about six days, wherein he was preserved in a sweet, sensi∣ble and tender frame of spirit, and at times spoke in substance as follows, viz. The doc∣tor coming to visit him, he said with cheer∣fulness,
<Q>I would have thee speak thy mind freely concerning me, for I am not afraid to die.</Q>
The doctor after some pause, signified the doubt he had of his re∣covery; which bringing an awful silence over his mind, he broke forth in earnest sup∣plication to the Lord for the welfare of Sion, and exhorted friends present to love and unity, and to beware of that spirit which would lead into a separation. He spoke clearly to the states of some, warning them to fear the Lord and walk humbly before him, and then they would be made parta∣kers of his divine and heavenly blessing. He prayed the Lord to prosper his work, and said, "The Lord will cause his glori∣ous truth to break forth in the north coun∣try, and among the Ethiopians," In a sight and sense whereof he rejoiced. Another time, his wife sitting by him, he look'd earnestly at her and said, "My dear, don't be surprised, for in time thou wilt come in∣to that rest that I am going into." She queried, "Dost thou think so?" He said "I have no doubt of it." Then taking
<PB N="60" REF="020377_0067_0FAF0998AD4464E8"/>
leave of her, he said, "Thou hast been a loving wife, a tender mother and a good neighbour." Taking leave of his children one by one, he charg'd them to be loving and obedient to their mother, and not to go out in their marriages. He prayed the Lord to make his passage easy, and receive him graciously into his arms of rest and peace forever; and desired his love to friends in general at their monthly, quarterly and yearly meetings, and meeting of ministers. After which, being sensible his end drew near, he said,
<Q>Give me a little water, and I think I shall not want any more, till I drink at that fountain which springs up into eternal life.</Q>
—Thus in a resigned frame of mind, he finished his course, the 10<HI>th</HI> day of the first month 1719-20, in the forty-sixth year of his age, and was in∣terr'd in friends burying-ground at Kennet. Concerning whom we believe, he is entered into the mansions of glory, where "The wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest."</P>

He was advanced to his forty-seventh year when he engaged in this service, and having a pros∣pect of a great work before him, requiring his close application, he drew his worldly business into a narrow compass, and devoted his time principally to the service of truth; not only visiting neighbouring meetings, but also travelled through New-Jersey, Long-Island, Rhode-Island, New-England and Maryland; and about the year 1715 per∣form'd a visit to friends in South-Britain. He was early appointed clerk of our month∣ly-meeting which service he performed ma∣ny years to satisfaction; being zealous and serviceable in the discipline, a diligent at∣tender of all our religious meetings, care∣ful in observing the time appointed and of∣ten concern'd to exhort such to amendment as were remiss herein.</P>
<P>In the eighth month 1721 his speech was much affected by frequent attacks of a pa∣ralytick disorder, but his understanding re∣maining clear, and being favour'd with the enjoyment of divine love, he was enabled to utter some sentences to those that visited him, saying,

Yet express'd his free resignation to the will of God, and in an humble tender frame of

And he now said,
<Q>I never thought to see thee more, but am glad to see thee.</Q>
I stayed there all night and in the morning we had a com∣fortable heart-melting time together, in which was revived the remembrance of the many favourable seasons of God's love we had enjoy'd in our travels in the work of the ministry of the gospel of Christ, and we tenderly prayed if we never met more in this world, we might meet in that which is to come, where we might never part more, but might forever live to sing with all the saints and holy angels, hallelujah to God and the Lamb.</P>

<HEAD>A Testimony from <HI>Salem</HI> Monthly-Meeting in <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> concerning <HI>JAMES DANIEL senior.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE memory of the righteous cannot soon be forgotten by those who follow their footsteps, but are as memorials, deep∣ly engraven on their minds, and are worthy to be had in remembrance, of which num∣ber was that steady friend and exemplary elder James Daniel, whose pious life and savoury conversation is fresh in some of our memories.</P>
<P>He was born in Ireland about the year 1675; his father Neal Daniel brought him over sea when about five years of age, and settled in Alloway's-Creek township in the county of Salem West-Jersey; at which time the white people were but few, and the natives a multitude. He learned their language perfectly, and has frequently said, that at that time the natives were a sober,
<PB N="66" REF="020377_0073_0FAF099EDD3B71B8"/>
grave and temperate people, and used no manner of oath in their speech. About the 15<HI>th</HI> year of his age his father died, leav∣ing him in the care of friends to be educat∣ed in the way of truth, which he embra∣ced in the love of it; and as he grew in age, he grew in experience and divine favour, and had a share of the oversight of the flock and eldership conferred upon him, which he faithfully performed in the spirit of love and meekness, thereby rendering his service acceptable and obtaining a good report. He ruled his own house well, having his children in subjection: Diligent in attending meet∣ings for worship and discipline, altho' for many years with difficulty, the country be∣ing new and roads not made; but after∣wards he, with considerable cost and labour, got bridges erected over some creeks and a public road made near his own house. His house and heart were open to entertain friends according to his ability; was zeal∣ously concerned for the honour of God and promotion of truth. He often lamented that as the country grew older the people grew worse, and had corrupted the natives in their morals, teaching them bad words and the excessive use of strong drink, which he, during many years in the latter part of his time, for example's sake took none of, and frequently admonished such as were in the use thereof, to observe great temperance.</P>
<P>In the latter years of his life, he desired his eldest sons to take the care of his tempo∣ral
<PB N="67" REF="020377_0074_0FAF09A2555E5A28"/>
concerns upon them, for his mind seem∣ed divested therefrom as much as tho' he possessed nothing, (a good example for all elders; for sorrowful experience shews us, that too many as they grow in years, grow more closely attached to the earth; which is a sorrowful prospect and poor example to the rising generation) but devoted his mind and time to truth's service, often accom∣panying friends in their religious engage∣ments, to his great satisfaction.</P>
<P>Whilst in health, the Lord gave him a sense that his departure drew near; soon af∣terwards he was taken with the pleurisy and lay about eight days, during which time he gave much good advice to his family, friends and neighbours that came to see him, to whom he also gave evident proofs of a happy exit. The day before his departure, many friends and neighbours came and had a religious meeting, after which, several taking leave, he said,
<Q>I am glad of this visit and of the meeting, but I have a great concern on my mind for this gene∣ration,</Q>
mentioning many growing evils then prevalent, and said,
<Q>Many of the elders are called away and more must soon; but I hope the Lord will raise up some that shall be faithful and zealous.</Q>

<HEAD>A Testimony from the Monthly-Meeting of <HI>Phi∣ladelphia,</HI> concerning <HI>HANNAH HILL.</HI></HEAD>
<P>OUR worthy and much esteemed friend Hannah Hill, wife of Richard Hill, and daughter of Thomas Lloyd (formerly governor of this province) by Mary the daughter of Gilbert Jones, of Welchpool, was born in Montgomeryshire North Wales, at the seat of her ancestors called Dolobran, the 21<HI>st</HI> of the seventh month 1666. She was a woman highly favoured of the Lord, possessed many excellent christian virtues, as well as natural accomplishments: Com∣ing over into this country with her parents when young; soon after their arrival it pleased the Lord to remove her pious mo∣ther by death, when the care of the younger children devolved upon her: This close tri∣al in the earlier part of her time, was abun∣dantly sanctified to her; for her mind be∣ing engaged to seek the Lord for her porti∣on, and her father's God for the lot of her inheritance, he was graciously pleased, not only to favour her with the knowledge of himself and the enjoyment of his living presence in the days of her youth, but also
<PB N="71" REF="020377_0078_0FAF09A4B4802F80"/>
made her a singular instrument of good, and a blessing to her father's family. As she grew in years, her conspicuous virtues, join∣ed with a courteous deportment, justly gain∣ed the esteem and favour of most if not all with whom she conversed. Being earnestly solicited in marriage by John Delaval, who (tho' a worthy man) was not at that time of the same religious communion, she, by her prudent conduct and pious resolution to maintain the principles she professed with∣out deviating therefrom in a matter of such importance, did not agree thereto; until he after some time embraced the truth in since∣rity of heart, and bore his cross like an humble follower of Christ; he received a gift in the ministry, and continued faithful therein to his death: Concerning whom she gave this testimony, viz. "That he never used to her an expression of anger, or the product of a disturbed mind." The decease of her said husband proved to her a time of deep probation, having been heard to say, that in eight weeks time she lost eight of her family by death, beginning with the decease of her beloved husband, and ending with that of her only child: Under which afflict∣ing circumstances, as well as what attend∣ed her the remaining part of her life (of which she had a large share) she approved herself a shining example of patience in tribulation, and a meek, humble, self-de∣nying follower of Christ.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="020377_0079_0FAF09A5C1419050"/>In the affluent station wherein divine pro∣vidence had placed her, her benevolent dis∣position was conspicuous in administring to the necessities of the indigent, her charity not being limited to those of her own pro∣fession. She was a true servant of the church, and in the sense of the apostle's ex∣pressions, "One that washed the saints feet," receiving with joy into her house, the mi∣nisters and messengers of the gospel, for whom her love was great: The low, the poor and the mean, were objects of her pe∣culiar care.</P>
<P>In her younger years she received a gift in the ministry, which she retained with faithfulness to the end; and tho' not large in her appearance, yet with great modesty and soundness of expression, "Her doctrine drop∣ped as the dew, and distilled as the small rain," and was therefore truly acceptable. She travelled in the service of the gospel, to New-England and divers other parts of this con∣tinent, and was also concern'd for the good order and discipline of the church, having for a number of years, served in the station of clerk of the women's monthly, quarterly and yearly meetings, wherein she gave satis∣faction.</P>
<P>Although bodily weakness frequently at∣tended her in the latter years of her life, it did not abate her love and zeal for the ever∣lasting truth, which she experienced to be her support in every time of trial; and when her dissolution drew near, she made divers
<PB N="73" REF="020377_0080_0FAF09A960EC3900"/>
seasonable remarks and observations, also signified her acquiescence with the divine will, in the dispensations of his providence towards her; at one time particularly men∣tioning the expressions of the apostle,
<Q>That no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous, nevertheless, after∣ward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exer∣cised thereby.</Q>
This was her happy ex∣perience; and after a well-spent life, inter∣spersed with a variety of exercising vicisi∣tudes, she exchanged this state of existence (no doubt) for a blessed immortality in the regions of unmixed felicity; after about three weeks illness, on the 25<HI>th</HI> of the twelfth month 1726-7, in the sixty-first year of her age. Her corpse was respectfully at∣tended by a large number of friends and others, to the High-street meeting-house in Philadelphia, where divers living testimonies were borne, after which it was interr'd in friends burial ground.</P>

<P>ON second-day the 25<HI>th</HI> of the seventh month 1727, I had the sorrowful ti∣dings of the death of my beloved friend James Lord; who, on his death-bed, desired that I might be sent for to his burial.

<HEAD>Some account of <HI>JOHN BEVAN,</HI> copied from a manuscript, appearing to be a testimony from a meeting in <HI>Wales</HI> concerning him, the con∣clusion of which is wanting. And tho' he was born and died in that country, yet hav∣ing lived many years in <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> the following memorial is thought not improper to be inserted in this Collection.</HEAD>
<P>OUR deceased friend John Bevan, the worthy subject of our testimony, hav∣ing deserved to have his name transmitted to posterity, for his pious life and conversati∣on, the following account of him, proba∣bly, will not only be satisfactory to his re∣lations, friends and acquaintance, but af∣ford edification and comfort to those who knew him not.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="020377_0083_0FAF09AB7329EE50"/>He was born about 1646, and well de∣scended; his parents died when he was very young, leaving five children, of whom he was the eldest. In 1665 he married a reli∣gious woman. His father had left him a considerable estate, but the rest of the chil∣dren were unprovided for; he therefore, when he came of age, (his sister being dead before) portioned all his brothers, and gave them a helpful subsistence in the world. Some years after, he was convinced of the blessed truth as it is in Jesus, the manner whereof, as he himself hath left it in writ∣ing, was thus,</P>
<P><Q>My wife was religiously inclined in her young years, and zealously concerned to observe the ceremonies of the church of England, and I believe (as she has often told me) she aimed sincerely therein at God's glory and the salvation of her im∣mortal soul. After we were joined in mar∣riage, she continued very zealous in that way; but when a weighty concern came upon my mind for the well-being of my immortal soul, I saw it very needful for me to make a narrow search after the best way, and those people who performed that worship and service that was accept∣able before God; and being in a weighty frame of spirit, the people called Quakers came before the view of my mind; and hearing of a book of George Fox the younger's, to be at a relation's house, I was willing to go thither for it, and in the
<PB N="77" REF="020377_0084_0FAF09AC2E5F27A0"/>
reading thereof, I was so well satisfied, that I can truly say, what I then read, answered the witness of God in my own bosom, as "Face answereth face in a glass:" But soon after I came home, my wife per∣ceiving me to be more serious and weigh∣ty in my spirit than formerly, was jealous I had an inclination towards that way which the people called Quakers made profession of; and finding I had the said book, came up to the chamber where I was, and cautioned me not to be beguil∣ed: I spoke to her in simplicity and much brokenness of heart, of the sense and sa∣tisfaction I had, that those who were faith∣ful to that divine principle which the people called Quakers bore testimony to, were the people God owned, or to that import; and it reached to God's witness in her, that we parted in much tenderness at that time. However she continued some∣what zealous in her way still, and would be often arguing with me in vindication thereof, much about twelve months; but at one time, when she was at their wor∣ship, the Priest denounced his excommu∣nication against me, and she being in a seat just under him, it came so near her that she was nigh to faint away; when their worship was over, she went to the Priest and spoke somewhat home to him, and that she thought she deserved more civility, at least so much as to know afore∣hand of their excommunication, for he
<PB N="78" REF="020377_0085_0FAF09AD0D556FD8"/>
might know that she sincerely loved her husband tho' he dissented from her in judgment. And after that time, she be∣came more willing to search closely into the weighty work of the salvation of her immortal soul; and the Lord's love was manifested to her, that in a little while af∣ter, her understanding came to be opened, and she came to be convinced of God's everlasting truth, that was promised
<Q>To lead into all truth.</Q>
And having tasted of that living bread that gives life to the soul, she came withal to see there was no need of the outward bread, which formerly she was zealous and conscientious in the observa∣tion of, to commemorate the death and passion of our Lord Jesus Christ; the true remembrancer being come and witnessed, even he
<Q>Who stands at the door of men's hearts for an entrance, that he may come to sup with them and they with him.</Q></Q></P>
<P><Q>Soon after our convincement, the ene∣my of souls mustered his forces, and en∣deavoured to stifle our convictions, and we were hard put to it both within and without, but as our eyes were to the Lord, and in poverty and humility of spirit we leaned upon him, he made the hard things easy, and in the sense of his divine love which was often shed abroad in our hearts, we were made willing to deny ourselves, to take up the cross, and to despise the shame. And tho' we were but a few, we thought it convenient to meet together to
<PB N="79" REF="020377_0086_0FAF09AF75DE0618"/>
wait upon the Lord, being fully satisfied it was a duty incumbent upon his people in all ages; and in the performance of our duty herein in the year 1675, several friends were taken from our house at two several times, and brought before two justices of the peace, who tendered the oath of allegiance and supremacy to them, and because, for conscience sake, they could not break the command of Christ who said "Swear not at all," they were committed to prison, where they remain∣ed about fourteen weeks, and then were set at liberty; ever since which, the meet∣ing has been kept either at our house or at the meeting-house, quietly without any more disturbance.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Sometime before the year 1683, we heard that our esteemed friend William Penn, had a patent from king Charles the second, for that province in America call∣ed Pennsylvania; and my wife had a great inclination to go thither, and thought it might be a good place to train up children amongst sober people, and to prevent the corruption of them here, by the loose be∣haviour of the youth and the bad example of too many of those of riper years; she ac∣quainted me therewith, but I then thought it not likely to take effect for several reasons; but as I was sensible her aim was upright on account of our children, I was willing to weigh the matter in a true balance; and I can truly say, my way was made
<PB N="80" REF="020377_0087_0FAF09B06623CB40"/>
easy and clear to go thither, beyond my expectation; and it was the Lord's great mercy to preserve us over the great deep to our desired port: And what hardships we met at the beginning of our settlement, the Lord was our helper and support to go through: And I can in a sweet re∣membrance say, many were the blessed sea∣sons we had with God's people in that re∣mote country, and I believe and am well satisfied that the Lord has a remnant there, that sincerely aim at his glory and the prosperity of his truth, blessed and prais∣ed be his holy name forever.</Q></P>
<P><Q>We staid there many years, and had four of our children married with our consent, and they had several children, and the aim intended by my wife, was in a good measure answered.—When a weigh∣ty concern came upon my mind to return to my native country, and that chiefly on truth's account. I laid it before my wife, and she could not be easy to stay behind me, and we came over in the year 1704; and through the Lord's great mercy we were preserved in that tedious voyage, north about Scotland through many difficulties, and from the cruelties also of the pri∣vateers, of which there were many then on that coast, as we were afterward in∣formed.— This wonderful preservation de∣serves to be remembered with thanksgiv∣ing; having lost the fleet, we were only four ships coming together from Virginia,
<PB N="81" REF="020377_0088_0FAF09B1B39F8F98"/>
and one of them belonging to Bristol, we thought to remove to that ship, because Bristol was nearer to our habitation in Wales than London, whither our vessel was bound; we agreed with the master for our passage, and next morning we were to go on board, but that night I was un∣der a weighty exercise about our removal, but in the morning it happened to be so stormy that he could not take us in, so he parted from us, and bore his course to∣wards Bristol; then the weight I was un∣der was removed, and I was very easy in my spirit; and as I was afterward inform∣ed, that ship was taken near to Lundy Island: This deliverance therefore and preservation of us, I ascribe to the Lord's great favour and mercy towards us, thanks, honour and praises be rendered and ascribed to him for the same and all other mercies forever.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In this voyage, our youngest daughter Barbara Bevan accompanied us, and she was of good service on truth's account, the short time she remained in the body; her innocency and sweet behaviour preach∣ed truth wherever she came. It is my comfort and great satisfaction, that she left a good savour, and has finished her course in peace with her maker, and is gone to her eternal rest in the mansions of bliss and joy, to laud and magnify him forever.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">A short testimony concerning her, worthy of perusal, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> printed in the 5th part of Piety Promoted.</NOTE></Q></P>

<Q>We landed at last at Shields in North∣umberland, and staid over the meeting on first-day, where we were comforted with friends; next day we set forward toward our habitation in Wales, having near three hundred miles to travel. We had several good meetings in our way, and about the beginning of the eighth month 1704, we came to our home at Treveyricke; and from that time forward my dear wife was given up as before, to be serviceable on truth's account, and so continued during her pilgrimage here, being six years and upwards. Her house and heart since her convincement, were open to receive the Lord's messengers, both here and in Ameri∣ca, and she was very careful and open hearted to help the poor and weak, both amongst us and others. In her last sick∣ness, she was sensible she was not like to recover out of it, and she was satisfied and contented therein to submit to the Lord's will; speaking to me, she said,
<Q>I take it as a great mercy that I am to go before thee, we are upwards of forty-five years married, and our love is rather more now towards one another, than at the be∣ginning, yet I am willing to part with all, for the Lord is better than all.</Q></Q>

And the young friend being of an innocent and good life and conversation, was well beloved amongst them; and fur∣ther, that the father and daughter had re∣ceived a gift of the ministry, which had been to the comfort and edification of the churches thereaway.—We heard he visited New-England in particular with our friend Hugh Roberts, about the year 1701.—Soon after he returned from Pennsylvania, he and his daughter visited together several meetings of friends in South and North Wales, and were eminently favoured there∣in with the divine presence.—His sufferings, considering his faithfulness and the time he lived in, were not very many; his relations at times diverting the strokes from him; however after a long prosecution by the Vicar of the parish for his pretended dues, he was at last confined to Cardiff goal in 1721, upon an excommunicatio capiendo, but there being some error in it, he was dis∣charged the following sessions, and ever af∣ter left unmolested.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="020377_0091_0FAF09B3C14604F0"/>He was endued with a good understand∣ing in things spiritual and temporal, discreet and prudent in his ways, of an unspotted life and conversation, grave and solid in his deportment, and careful to keep concord and unity among friends, constant and un∣moveable against that which would divide and rend, yet labouring to restore those that were beguiled thereby. In his last sickness, he had no small conflict, but he was favour∣ed with much patience and possessed his soul therein, and bore his indisposition to admi∣ration. —At one time he said,

Oh! the cry that ran through my soul, and in the anguish and bitterness of my spirit, I said, <HI>Lord what will thou do with friends children when we are gone off the stage of this world; will thou raise up children, and not those of be∣lieving parents?</HI> And this was the word that livingly sprung up in my soul. <HI>They reject my counsel and cast my law behind their backs, and will have none of my reproofs, and tho' my hand be stretched forth all the day long, yet they will not hear, but go after their own hearts lust.</HI> Then I said in my heart, <HI>Lord are they all so?</HI> The answer was, <HI>there are some that are innocent, whom I will bless with a blessing from me, and they shall shine forth to my praise.</HI> And now, Oh friends! that you may dwell and abide in the innocent life, that so the blessing of the Lord you

may feel daily to descend upon you. But as for you that "Reject the counsel of the Lord and cast his law behind your backs, and will have none of his reproofs," which are sorrowful sayings concerning you who are the children of believing parents, you who are under the profession of the truth, which will do you no good, unless you re∣turn unto the Lord; therefore I desire you may all return unto him, whilst the day of a long-suffering merciful God lasteth: But if you still reject the counsel of the Lord, the many faithful warnings you have had, how will you answer it in the day when he cometh, "To render unto every one accord∣ing to their deeds?" And now, something further is with me to parents of children. Dear friends, you that have been convinced of God's unchangeable truth, and have known the work and operation of it, work∣ing out and bringing down that which was of a contrary nature to it. And Oh! that we may all abide faithful in his work, and retain our integrity to the Lord, then let our breathing cries and prayers be offered up to the Lord for our children, that he would be pleased to look down in mercy upon them, and visit them as he did our souls. But as David said, "If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me;" so I desire we may all be clear in our offerings before the Lord, that he may smell a sweet savour from them.</P>

And to his praise we can say, he hath been with us since we came to this country, and hath preserv∣ed us through many and various exercises, both inwardly and outwardly.

truth by his worthy parents, who lived to see the religion of his education become that of his choice and practice in his mature years, in which he was preserved to the last, without wavering, in great peace with the Lord and unity of his brethren.</P>
<P>He was an hospitable man, very ready to entertain strangers, especially the Lord's messengers, whom he treated with great re∣spect and affection, honouring them for their work's sake; being also charitable to the poor, and as a man of trade and com∣merce, obtained a good reputation, having declared he had never wronged any man knowingly in all his life.</P>
<P>In the time of his illness, which continu∣ed about two weeks, he seemed very patient and resigned to the will of God, and much concerned for the everlasting welfare of his children, which he expressed in a lively manner; and often in fervent prayer, de∣sired they might be preserved from the vanities and corruptions of this world, and that they might love and fear the Lord in their youth, saying at one time, "O Lord preserve my flock, let them never go astray, nor forget thee nor one another: O my God! hold them in thy arms that none of them be lost, let not the enemy prevail over them:" Being humbly thankful and blessed God, that he had been pleased to support him through every dispensation of his pro∣vidence to that time.

<HEAD>A Testimony from <HI>Gwynedd</HI> Monthly-Meeting in <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> concerning <HI>ROWLAND ELLIS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>OUR ancient and esteemed friend Row∣land Ellis, was born in the year 1650, in Merionethshire North Wales, convinced of the truth about the twenty-second year of his age, suffered several years imprison∣ment with constancy on account of his testi∣mony, it being then a time of sore perse∣cution; the two judges who committed him with many others for refusing to take the oath of allegiance and supremacy, declared openly at the assizes, "That in case they refused a second time to take it, they should be proceeded against as traitors, the men hanged and quartered, and the women burn∣ed." In 1686 he came over into Pennsyl∣vania to prepare for a settlement for his wife and family, with whom he return'd in 1697. He was endued with a gift in the ministry, and tho' not very frequent in appearance therein, his service was acceptable and to edification; being of sound judgment, rea∣dy and willing to assist his neighbours and friends in all cases civil or religious when
<PB N="92" REF="020377_0099_0FAF0847413CCD90"/>
desired. He was zealous for supporting our christian discipline, and exemplary in con∣ducting himself agreeable therewith, some∣times saying "If the hedge of discipline was not kept up, the labour of the husband∣man would soon be laid waste." He was careful in educating his children religiously, by timely endeavouring to inculcate in them the principles of piety and virtue; a practice of his tending thereto, was, having meet∣ings frequently in his family, which he long continued. In the last monthly-meeting he attended he was taken unwell, but after∣wards said to divers friends present, "I am glad I was here to day, for I had a lively meeting, and though I now feel much weak∣ness and the infirmities attending my ad∣vanced age, yet I can say, truth is as dear and as sweet as ever." He also said,
<Q>Sa∣tan sometimes lies in wait like a roaring lion to devour me, but I find he is chain∣ed by a secret hand which limits his pow∣er, so that he cannot harm me.</Q>
His in∣disposition continued a few days, which he bore with christian patience, expressing "His sense of his near arrival at the ha∣ven of rest and quiet, where none could make him afraid." He expired at the house of his son-in-law John Evans, in the eighti∣eth year of his age, and was interr'd in friends burying-ground at Plymouth, (to which particular meeting he belonged) in the seventh month 1729. Concerning whom we trust it may be said, <HI>he rests, enjoying the re∣ward of the righteous, and his works do follow.</HI></P>

<P>In the year 1699, he was convinced by the ministry of Thomas Story, who left this testimony respecting him, "That he was the most sober and knowing person in those parts."

<P>SHE appeared in the ministry in her youthful days, and continuing faithful, she travelled on that account, several times through New-England, the Jerseys, Penn∣sylvania, Maryland and Virginia in Ameri∣ca, and through England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales in Europe; her ministry being savoury and to edification.

<Q>I have travelled a pretty deal in my time, and, according to my ability, have laboured in the love of God (in the service of truth, and good∣will to all men) which springs in my bo∣som now as fresh as ever; blessed be his name. And I desire thee (if I go) by a few lines, to remember my kind love to friends, desiring they may stand in the counsel of God; for I have often rejoiced and been glad, to see friends stand in his counsel and keep their places in the truth; and on the contrary, it has often wound∣ed my spirit, to see those that have made a profession of the truth, (and some of them children of good parents) take un∣due liberty, taking pleasure in vanity and folly, and neglecting that which would be to their everlasting peace. It is my advice to friends, that they stand in the counsel of God, which will be to them as a mighty rock in a weary land, and enable them to wade through the various exercises and troubles which may fall to their share to meet with in this trouble∣some world. I have found it by experi∣ence to be a sure help in every needful and difficult time, when exercises seemed to surround me on every hand like the billows of the main, then I found, to stand in the counsel of God, was the on∣ly place of refuge that I could retire unto, where I found safety, and was often re∣freshed,

strengthened and comforted by the influence of the love of God in me; and I would counsel and advise, that all friends keep close to meetings, and pa∣tiently wait to feel their strength renewed in God. And as it has been the desire and labour of my spirit, that friends should keep up their meetings in good order, and in the wisdom of truth; so I recommend it as my advice and counsel to friends, to be careful to keep to meet∣ings, and patiently wait to feel the over∣shadowing power of truth, to strengthen and renew their hope in God, which brings down and abases every thing that would exalt itself above the peaceable government of truth.</Q>
After having lain sometime in great stillness, she, in fervent prayer, besought the Lord,

A good example in attending meetings, a faithful labourer therein, and careful in keeping to the hour appointed. He was industrious in outward affairs, tho' cheerfully given up to answer the requirings of truth; visiting the meet∣ings of friends in Pennsylvania, as also in New-Jersey and Maryland generally. He was gifted in discipline, and likewise quali∣fied for the service of visiting families, wherein he was engaged the last time he was absent from home, within the limits of Bush-River and Deer-Creek particular meet∣ings;

<Q>There was an unusual weight over his spirit, and a cloud that he could not see beyond, which made him think his days work was nearly over.</Q>
The night he return'd home, he was affected with sickness and much pain, which con∣tinued several days, bearing the same with exemplary patience. Afterwards growing weaker but remaining sensible, he often ex∣pressed,

<P>HE was born in Nancemond county in Virginia, in the year 1695, being the third son of Robert Jordan, as well as one
<PB N="100" REF="020377_0107_0FAF084EB294BEE8"/>
of the third generation who have walked in the truth. He was of a sprightly genius, affable disposition, and even temper, which, as he grew to manhood, gave him easy ac∣cess to company, esteemed the better sort. A visitation of divine love being extended to him about the twenty-second year of his age, he like Zaccheus, made haste, and with joy embraced, both the message and the messenger of salvation: And being endued with a gift in the ministry, acquitted him∣self "As a workman that need not be ashamed," and had great place in the minds of men. Altho' he had not much school literature, yet he might be said to have had the tongue of the learned, being both cor∣rect and concise in speaking the word in sea∣son, insomuch that divers have confessed to the truth and embraced the doctrine he preached. Being patient in tribulation, he was favour'd with that hope which affords content and solace of mind. After labour∣ing in the gospel in his own country and the adjacent provinces, he visited most parts of England, Ireland, and divers parts of Holland; being absent on this service above three years, he returned with peace, and found his presence necessary at home; for his father being deceased, and his brother Robert then absent, the care of the family devolved upon him, which trust he discharg∣ed with judgment, being a good oecono∣mist, kind neighbour and steady friend.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="020377_0108_0FAF084F737F6920"/>He often intimated that he should not continue long, and was therefore concern'd to use diligence. Not long before his de∣cease, he visited friends in Virginia and North-Carolina, edifying them with his gift; and in the beginning of the month in which he died, (tho' very weak in body) attended their quarterly meeting, signifying at his return, his great satisfaction therein, be∣lieving it would be the last meeting of the kind he should ever be at, and accordingly he never afterwards went from home, except to a week-day meeting in the neighbour∣hood.</P>
<P>On the morning of the day of his disso∣lution, he uttered many savoury expressions, saying to some young ministers,
<Q>Mind your gifts and the Lord will bless you, and you will be a blessing to the church. Be humble and obedient; obedience brings sweet peace. I have a great desire there might be a right ministry continued in the church, for there are many not strict∣ly of this fold, who in due time the Lord will bring in: And as you come to have an experience of the work of truth in your own hearts, you will be able to con∣fute them who persuade themselves there is no living without sin in this world. I am not in a condition to speak much, neither is it, I hope, very needful; as you are thus taught of the Lord, you will have cause to rejoice in him on whom you have believed.</Q></P>

<P>HE was born in Yorkshire Old England, of parents who were members of the church of England. In his youth he was inclined to vanity, but his mind being reached thro' the visitation of divine grace. When he grew up, he joined in fellowship with friends; and came to America in 1712,

<P>He began the world with little, but being industrious in the creation, and concern'd for truth's prosperity, the Lord blessed his labours, so that he lived comfortably and maintained his family reputably, support∣ing the character of an honest peaceable man, and was often instrumental in restor∣ing peace amongst others.

<P>HE was a member of our monthly-meet∣ing above forty years, so that some of us had opportunities of being intimately ac∣quainted

<P>By which it will appear, that he was, in the early part of his life, sensibly affected with the visitation of divine life and grace, and, by adhering thereunto, was preserved from the vanities and follies, which often divert and alienate the minds of youth from the due remembrance and awful regard of their creator; so that he was enabled to bear a testimony of christian patience and self-denial in his youthful days, and, by keep∣ing under that exercise, as he advanced in years, attained to further knowledge and experience in the work of religion, in which he had a sight of the necessity of keeping in a state of humility, and of bearing the cross of Christ, which mortified him to the world; so that the loss many sustain by the anxious pursuit of the lawful things thereof appear∣ing to him, he was concerned to avoid it, and in obedience to the precept of Christ, to <HI>seek first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness,</HI> having faith in his promise, <HI>that all these things</HI> (necessary for him) <HI>should be added.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the love of God influencing his mind, and opening his understanding, he
<PB N="105" REF="020377_0112_0FAF0854A314A2F8"/>
became concerned for the general good of mankind, and received a gift of the mini∣stry of the gospel of Christ, before he had attained the age of twenty-one years; in the public exercise of which, he soon after travelled thro' many parts of England, and into Scotland, and the next year, being 1697, he came to visit friends in this and the ad∣jacent provinces of America, where his mi∣nistry and conversation were to the comfort and edification of the faithful, (as some of us can with satisfaction declare, from our knowledge and remembrance of him at that time) and the near fellowship and union he then had with friends here (we believe) con∣tributed to his more speedy determination of settling among us, which he afterwards thought it his duty to do, tho' the leaving his parents and relations (as he afterwards expressed) was no small cross to him, being of a dutiful and affectionate disposition.</P>
<P>After fixing his residence among us, he persever'd in his concern and labour for the edification of the churches, and gathering people to faith and dependance on the in∣ward teachings of Christ, and for that pur∣pose only he travelled many long journies and voyages through the several English colonies on this continent, and most of the islands in the West-Indies, and in Europe, through England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Holland, Frizeland, and several parts of Germany, and the adjacent northern king∣doms; and in many of these places his mi∣nistry
<PB N="106" REF="020377_0113_0FAF0854C36C4050"/>
and religious labours were blessed with the desired success, of which there are yet some witnesses living, and others, who were convinced of the principles of truth by his means, became serviceable members of the church, and continued therein to the end of their lives.</P>
<P>But as the wise king Solomon formerly observed, that <HI>one event cometh to the righte∣ous, and to the wicked,</HI> so it happened to this good man, who met with various losses and disappointments in his temporal estate; af∣ter which, the circumstances of his affairs engaged him to undertake some business, in the management of which he was obliged to cross the seas frequently: This, however, did not abate his zeal and religious care to make use of all opportunities of visiting the meetings of friends when among them, and of calling, at other times, to such who might be accounted as <HI>the outcast of Israel, and the dispersed of Judah, or as sheep not yet of the fold of Christ;</HI> and his services of that kind are worthy to be commemorated, having been often productive of good effects.</P>
<P>His patience was remarkable in disap∣pointments and afflictions, of which he had a large share; and his meekness, humility and circumspection, in the general course of his life and conversation, were conspicu∣ous and exemplary; and as he frequently exhorted and admonished others to the ob∣servation and practice of the many excellent precepts and rules of Christ, our Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd

lawgiver, and more especially those express∣ed in his sermon on the mount (which con∣tains the sum of our moral and religious duties) so he manifested himself to be one of that number, whom Christ compared to the wise builder, who laid a sure foundati∣on; so that his building stood unshaken by the various floods and winds of tribulations and temptations he met with, both from within and without.</P>
<P>He was a lover of unity amongst bre∣thren, and careful to promote and maintain it, shewing the example of a meek, courte∣ous, and loving deportment, not only to friends, but to all others, with whom he had conversation or dealings; so that it may be truly said, that <HI>few have lived so universal∣ly beloved and respected among us</HI>: And it was manifest this did not proceed from a desire of being popular, or to be seen of man: For his love and regard to peace did not divert him from the discharge of his duty in a faithful testimony to those that professed the truth, that they ought to be careful to maintain good works; and he was often concerned zealously to incite and press friends to the exercise of the good or∣der and discipline established in the wisdom of truth, by admonishing, warning, and timely treating with such as fell short of their duty therein, and by testifying against those who, after loving and brotherly care and endeavours, could not be brought to
<PB N="108" REF="020377_0115_0FAF0856392931A8"/>
the sense and practice of their duty; and thereby he sometimes shar'd the ill-will and resentment of such persons.</P>
<P>The several Essays he wrote on religious subjects at sea, are further proofs that his mind was principally engaged in the great business and concern of religion; and as he continued under the same engagement to the end, we are fully persuaded the words with which he concluded his last public testimony on the island of Tortola, may be truly and properly applied to him, <HI>that he had fought a good fight, and had kept the faith, and</HI> we doubt not, <HI>he now enjoys a crown of righteousness.</HI></P>
<P>Much more might be truly said of his in∣tegrity, faithfulness and worth, but we do not think it necessary; our chief intention being to express our respectful remembrance of him, and our unity with his labours and services; and we are sincerely desirous, that the glory of every good and perfect work may be attributed to that divine power alone, which can qualify others to supply the places of those faithful ministers and servants of Christ, who have been of late years removed from among us, and are of that number, of whom it is written, <HI>blessed are the dead, which die in the Lord, from hence∣forth, yea, saith the spirit, that they may rest from their labours, and their works do follow them.</HI></P>
<P>He departed this life on the island of Tor∣tola (where he was engaged on a religious visit) the 4<HI>th</HI> day of the ninth month 1741, aged upwards of sixty-six years.</P>

<P><Q>I early found a concern on my mind to visit friends in Maryland, which I did on both sides of the bay (Cheasapeak) in fear and trembling, being young and weak, and the work very exercising by reason of an obvious declension, which occasioned me much exercise in speaking and writing against the spirit of liberty, superfluity, and conformity to the world, for a testimony against which, in many particulars, ancient friends suffered much; but now, with many is the offence of that cross ceased, and friend's sufferings tram∣pled upon, to the great grief of my spirit, respecting tythes, apparel &amp;c. And as the Lord hath been pleased to commit a part of the ministry to me, and of that part which is more necessary than desirable, in this age of the church, he hath been graciously pleased hitherto to furnish with a suitable ability for his honour, and my faithful discharge of duty; for, as before my ap∣pearance I was long under the concern, being fully convinced it was required of me, but giving way to reasonings, the suggestions and buffetings of Satan, I was likely to lose my condition, had not the Lord been very gracious, who knew that I did not hold back obstinately, but thro' human weakness, and contempt of my∣self for such a weighty service; so in a

deep travail of soul once in a meeting, breathing for strength to bring forth, I desired, that the Lord would commit the hardest part of the work to my charge, which I think was granted, and a hard travail I had in my first appearance; but it fared otherwise with my brother, whom I prefer, he was not disobedient to the heavenly vision, submitting speedily to the call, and has been very prosperous hitherto; may the Lord preserve us stea∣dy and faithful to the end.</Q></P>
<P><Q>After this, we travelled together in Maryland, visiting friends on each side of the bay, and at the yearly-meeting near Choptank, having meetings also in the way on our return, and were frequently employed and zealously concerned in the Lord's work; blessed be his name who hath called us out of darkness, and with the day spring from on high visited our souls, accounting us worthy of this high vocation, even to hold forth the glory of this gospel day, giving encouragement and enlargement of heart in the mysteries and doctrines of his kingdom, so that in the ability of divine faith, we frequently travelled about, both in Virginia and Carolina, while young; but as there is a diversity of gifts, so there is of operation, according to the good pleasure of our great benefactor, and the emergency of times and occasions; so let not us of the mini∣stry, imitate one another in this respect,

but be careful, dear friends, to keep to our true guide, the holy spirit, for youth is warm, zealous, and without seasonable caution and watchfulness, apt to exceed ability and experience, and so may be over∣strained, and sustain loss and injury.</Q></P>
<P>In the year 1722, he performed a religious visit as far as New-England, which employ∣ed him about ten months, and on his return home, he was sued in the beginning of the following year for priests wages, and for his refusal to comply with the demand, he of∣fered to the magistrates in writing, sundry considerations, which being taken amiss, he was, after some time, indicted by the grand jury, and summoned before the go∣vernor and council; in this time of trial (he says)
<Q>Some forsook me as being asham∣ed of my testimony, and of my sufferings for it; at my first appearance the fierce∣ness of the dragon was felt, his dark pow∣er seeming to be great and terrible, as though he would have swallowed me up quick, and truth's adversaries seemed to rejoice, for I was made to stand like a fool for them to glory over me; however my mind being composed, and stayed in still∣ness on the Lord, with earnest breathings for divine aid in this his cause, for which and myself, I found it safest to say little at that time, being greatly desirous that I might not give way one jot from my tes∣timony, through fear even of death itself, for I thought I felt the bitterness of it strike at my natural life.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="020377_0120_0FAF085C8B6196E8"/>
<Q>On the day when final judgment on the case was to be given, I was brought before them the third time, and they demanded what I had further to say before sentence was passed; I then desired liberty to make my defence, and to give my sense on the contents of my paper, the commissary or chief priest having perverted my meaning, which request the governor seemed dis∣posed to allow, but it was afterwards de∣nied, as I apprehend, through the influ∣ence of the priest, howbeit I told them I remembred to have read a proviso of an act of parliament, that no man should be punished for any offence against the act, unless he was prosecuted within three months after the fact, but this, said I, was about seven months after; but some of the court resolving on severity to in∣duce me to submit, they proceeded to give sentence of a years imprisonment, or bonds with security for good behaviour &amp;c. when with a composed mind and an audible voice, I said, <HI>this is an hard sentence and I pray God to forgive mine adversaries,</HI> which affected divers of the bystanders with tears, and one in particular, a judge, and man of note, was much affected, made him∣self acquainted, and conversed with me more than once, appears to be a tender man, and well convinced, having since gladly received meetings into his house, and as he has told me, laid down his commission.—</Q></P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="020377_0121_0FAF085DA67CFF30"/>
<Q>Being committed to prison, I was first placed in the debtors apartment, but in a few days was removed into the common side, where condemned persons are kept, and for sometime had not the privilege of seeing any body, except a negro who once a day brought water to the prisoners; this place was so dark, that I could not see to read even at noon, without creeping to small holes in the door; being also very noisome, the infectious air brought on me the flux, that, had not the Lord been pleased to have sustained me by his invi∣sible hand, I had there lost my life; the governor was made acquainted with my condition, and I believe used his endea∣vours for my liberty: The commissary vi∣sited me more than once under a shew of friendship, but with a view to ensnare me, and I was very weary of him. I wrote again to the governor, to acquaint him of my situation; so after a confinement of three weeks, I was discharged, without any acknowledgment or compliance, and this brought me into an acquaintance, and ready admittance to the governor, who said I was a meek man &amp;c.—Thus I returned home with praise and thanksgiv∣ing in my heart to the Lord, who had caused his truth to triumph over the strong efforts of man and the powers of the earth.</Q></P>
<P>In the year 1725, accompanied by Tho∣mas Pleasants, he again visited friends in Maryland, and the yearly-meeting near
<PB N="115" REF="020377_0122_0FAF085DC7BE96F8"/>
Choptank. My concern here (he says)
<Q>Was principally to labour for the restoration of wholesome discipline, the neglect whereof I conceive has been a great cause of the disorder and undue liberty prevailing among the professors of truth there, and when the service of this meeting was over, we visited the meetings on the western shore, and returned home, having left an example of that useful and necessary prac∣tice of visiting families, joining friends therein for sometime; we are, thanks be to God, come and coming into the same in Virginia, which, with some assistance, I have pretty generally performed through our monthly-meeting, and never, I think, was more sensible of the company and ability of truth in any service, according to the dignity of it.</Q></P>
<P>A malicious person getting into his pos∣session, the judgment obtained against him for the demand of tythes before mentioned, had seven of his cattle seized and appraised, but deferred taking them away until about two years after, when he procured a new action against him, alledging, but not prov∣ing, that Robert had converted at least a part of them to his own use, and so manag∣ed the matter in his absence, as to make the debt amount to twenty-pounds, tho' the demand was but eight-pounds, and serving the execution on his body, he was again committed to prison in the twelfth month 1727, where being confined fifteen weeks,
<PB N="116" REF="020377_0123_0FAF085E72912508"/>
he was at length discharged, without any person paying any thing for him, which he would not suffer.</P>
<P>Soon after he was brought under a trial, with others of his friends, by the operati∣in of a militia-law, whereupon they address∣ed governor Gooch on his arrival, represent∣ing to him their sufferings by spoil of goods and imprisonment, which, with the friends who attended on the occasion, he received with kindness.</P>
<P><Q>Having this year (he remarks) suffered persecution in body and estate, as a pre∣parative to a greater affliction, (all which doth and will work for good) my dear af∣fectionate wife was called away.</Q></P>
<P>The next year 1728, he embark'd for Great-Britain, with our friend Samuel Bow∣nas, who had accomplished his journeys on this continent in the service of the gospel; and after performing a religious visit to the meetings of friends in England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland, he proceeded to Barba∣dos, and arrived from thence in this city in 1730, then went to Virginia, and in the same year performed a visit as far eastward as Rhode-Island, accompanied by his inti∣mate friend Caleb <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>per of Burlington.</P>
<P>The following year intermarrying with Mary the widow of Richard Hill, he became a member of our monthly-meeting, and after a visit to the meetings of friends in Maryland and Virginia, he embark'd on a second visit to Great-Britain, from whence
<PB N="117" REF="020377_0124_0FAF085F35C601A8"/>
he returned in the summer of 1734, between which time and the year 1738, he perform∣ed another visit eastward, and three to the southern provinces, besides one to South-Ca∣rolina and Georgia, and from thence proceed∣ed to Rhode-Island, and to Boston, and in 1740 he went on a second visit to Barbados, and in the succeeding year, accompanied by Caleb Raper, he accomplished his last visit eastward as far as Boston.</P>
<P>Hereby we may observe his unwearied ap∣plication and exercise, to fulfill the ministry which he had received of the Lord. He was a member of this meeting above ten years, and tho' his time was much employed in his religious duties abroad, he did not omit the adjacent meetings, being industrious and laborious for the general welfare and prosperity of the churches; for the promoti∣on whereof he was, through the divine anointing, eminently qualified.</P>
<P>His ministry being convincing and con∣solatory, his delivery graceful but unaffect∣ed; in prayer he was solemn and reverent; he delighted in meditation, recommending by example, religious retirement in his familiar visits among his friends; in his sen∣timents he was generous and charitable, yet a firm opposer of obstinate libertines in principles or practice, demonstrating his love to the cause of Religion and righteous∣ness above all other considerations, being careful to adorn the doctrine of the gospel, by a life of piety and benevolence, and we

have ground to hope and believe he was, prepared for the sudden summons from his pilgrimage here, which was on the fifth day of the eighth month O. S. 1742, when be∣ing at the house of one of his most intimate friends on the third day of the week in the morning, waiting for the hour of meeting, he was seized with a fit of the apoplexy, which very soon deprived him of speech, and he died about midnight following, in the forty-ninth year of his age, being a minister about 24 years; his burial on the 7<HI>th</HI> of the same month was attended by a great number of his fellow-citizens, to our meeting-house in High-street, and thence to the grave-yard.</P>

<P>HE was convinced of the principle of truth when young, and underwent many deep baptizing seasons, by which, it is believed, he was in a good degree made an overcomer. He travelled much in the exercise of his gift in the ministry, having visited his brethren in truth's service, in most or all parts of this continent where friends then resided; and crossed the seas twice to Europe on the same account, and once to the island of Barbados. In which concern he was always careful to have the

He was also serviceable amongst us in meetings of disci∣pline. His last visit was to the island of Tortola, in company with our worthy friend John Estaugh. He was taken unwell on his passage thither, yet when he landed, pro∣ceeded in the service he went upon, to the satisfaction of friends there, as appears from accounts sent hither by a friend of that island.

<P>THE remembrance of our dear deceased friend John Estaugh, remains as a good savour on many of our minds. He was born in Keldevon in Essex in Great-Britain, on the 23<HI>d</HI> of the second month 1676. In the year 1700, he came over to America on a religious visit, which he performed to the great satisfaction of friends; after which, he settled at Haddonfield, in the county of Gloucester, and western division of New-Jersey. He has been heard to say, that when he first settled in our parts, he was
<PB N="120" REF="020377_0127_0FAF08619E4027E8"/>
nearly united to a solid remnant of friends that then belonged to Newtown-meeting, and that he had been careful to feel the draw∣ings of the father's love in visiting neigh∣bouring meetings, in many of which, he was favoured to minister suitably to the states and conditions of those that heard him; he being as a scribe well instructed, who brought forth out of the heavenly trea∣sury, things both new and old.—Since his first settlement among us, he visited friends in England, Ireland, New-England and some of the West-India-Islands, several times. He was an humble minded exemplary friend, solid and grave in his deportment, well be∣coming a minister of Christ, zealous for pre∣serving good order in the church, and main∣taining love and unity, that badge of true discipleship, remarkably careful in his con∣versation among men, his words being few and savoury. The last visit which he made was to the island of Tortola, where after his service was over, he was taken sick, and departed this life: And we doubt not but that he is in the fruition of that glory and happiness which will never have an end.</P>

<HEAD>An Abstract from <HI>Elizabeth Estaugh's</HI> Testimo∣ny, concerning her beloved husband <HI>JOHN ESTAUGH</HI> deceased, prefixed to a treatise of his, entitled <HI>"A call to the unfaithful professors of truth.</HI>"</HEAD>
<P>SINCE it pleased divine providence so highly to favour me, with being the near companion of this dear worthy, I can∣not be altogether silent, but must give some small account of the early working of truth in him. He was born of religious parents, but grew uneasy with the religious professions of both father and mother who were of dif∣ferent persuasions, and being a seeker, fell in with the baptists, and liked them so well he was near joining them. But a neighbour who was a friend, being dead, he was in∣vited to the burial, where that worthy mi∣nister of the gospel, Francis Stamper of London, being led to speak with life and power directly to his state, it made such deep impressions on his tender mind, that put him upon search into the principles of friends, and being fully satisfied, joined with them in the seventeenth year of his age.</P>
<P>About the eighteenth year of his age, he came forth in the ministry, and being faith∣ful he grew in his gift, so that in some time he travelled to visit friends in the north of England, and Scotland, and in the year 1700 came over on a visit to friends in America. We were married on the first day of the tenth
<PB N="122" REF="020377_0129_0FAF08651E46B3B0"/>
month 1702, and settled at Haddonfield in New-Jersey. In the fore part of his time he travelled pretty much; but in the latter part he was prevented therefrom by an infirmity of body; and his good master, who requires no impossibilities of his servants, favoured him with being easy at home; where thro' mercy, we lived very comfortably; few, if any, in a married state, ever lived in sweet∣er harmony than we did. He was a pattern of moderation in all things; not lifted up with any enjoyments, nor cast down at dis∣appointments; a man endowed with many good gifts, which rendered him very agree∣able to his friends, and much more to me, his wife.</P>
<P>After some years of indisposition, (as be∣fore is observed) it pleased the Lord to re∣store him to a state of health; and soo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> af∣ter he had a concern to visit friends at Tor∣tola. This brought on him a deep exercise, but when he was confirmed it was really re∣quired of him, he gave up to it; and was then weaned from home, and the company there which used to be so pleasant to him. He first wrote to friends on that island; but finding that would not excuse him, he durst no longer delay; so, on the 13<HI>th</HI> of the eighth month 1742, we parted in the aboundings of love and affection. And now, the most acceptable account I can give of his service in Tortola, is extracted from two letters which I received from a friend of that place, directed to me, and to the following effect, viz.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="020377_0130_0FAF0865872DA580"/>
<Q>On the eighth of the ninth month 1742, he arrived at the house of John Pickering with his companion John Cadwalader, where they were received with much love and great joy, being made to rejoice together in the tender mercies and love of God, which was greatly manifested that day, to the honour and praise of his great name, and also to the comforting of his poor peo∣ple. The testimonies of these servants of the Lord were with life and power, and were as clouds fill'd with rain upon a thir∣sty land.—</Q></P>
<P><Q>But to be more particular concerning thy dear husband, whose memory is dear and precious to me, and many more whose hearts were open to receive the glad-ti∣dings which he brought. His godly life and conversation spoke him to be a true follower of the the Lamb, and minister of Jesus Christ, whom he freely preached, and by the effectual power of whose di∣vine love, was he called forth to our as∣sistance, for which we bless, praise and magnify the God of all our mercies: And as a faithful messenger, with much love, in a tender frame of spirit, would he in∣vite all to the fountain which had healed him. O! the deep humility that appear∣ed in him in the time of his public testi∣mony; and when in private conversation with his near and dear friends, as he of∣ten said we were to him, how cheerful and pleasant would he be, in that blessed free∣dom
<PB N="124" REF="020377_0131_0FAF08669CA4C380"/>
wherein Christ had made him free, Innocent, harmless, of a cheerful coun∣tenance, yet not without a christian gra∣vity well becoming the doctrine he preach∣ed. He was valiant for the truth to the last, and tho' he is gone to his grave, his memory is sweet and precious.</Q></P>
<P><Q>He had his health very well until the death of his dear companion; but going to his burial, we were caught in a shower of rain, which we and he believed was the occasion of his illness. However, he was mightily favoured with the divine presence, which enabled him to answer the service of that day; and the next, be∣ing the first day of the week, we had a blessed meeting, the Lord's presence ac∣companying us; and tho' thy dear hus∣band was so near his end, his candle shin'd as bright as ever, and many that beheld it were made to glorify God on his behalf, This was the last opportunity on this island, save his farewell upon his dying bed, where he both preached and prayed, a lit∣tle before his departure.</Q></P>
<P><Q>On the next day, being the second day of the week, he went to a little island call∣ed Jos Vandicks, accompanied with seve∣ral friends; but on the 3<HI>d</HI> day in the morning he complained very much, yet was enabled to go to meeting, where a pretty many people were assembled, and a blessed opportunity we had together, to the tendring and melting our hearts into a heavenly frame.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="020377_0132_0FAF0866B87B4250"/>
<Q>But he who never spared his labour whilst amongst us, extending his voice as a trumpet of the Lord's own sounding, was so inwardly spent he was ready to faint. However, he went on board the sloop that afternoon, and next morning came ashore at our house; where he had not been long before a shivering fit seized him, and a fever soon followed, which kept its constant course every day. This being the 1<HI>st</HI> day of the tenth month, he took great notice that it ended forty years since his marriage with thee; that during that time you had lived in much love, and parted in the same; and that thou wast his greatest concern of all outward enjoy∣ments. And tho' the last two days he was in much pain, yet he was preserved under it in much patience and resignation, and had his perfect senses to the last, exhort∣ing friends to faithfulness, &amp;c. And on, the 6<HI>th</HI> day of the tenth month, about six-o'clock at night, he went away like a lamb, with praises and thanksgivings in his lips but about two minutes before.</Q>
Thus far from the said letters.</P>
<P>And thus finished this dear worthy in the sixty-seventh year of his age; highly fa∣voured by his great and good master in the very extreme moments; the consideration whereof, and the account given of his ser∣vice, afford me, at times, some relief. And I have a secret satisfaction in that I was en∣abled to give him up (tho' so dear to me)

unto the service into which he was called. This is a hint for those who may be under the like exercise and trial, that they may not hold back, but submit, and freely give up their all, leaving the consequence to the wise disposing hand, who knows for what cause it is, he is pleased so nearly to try his people.</P>

<P>HE was the eldest son of John and Do∣rothy Pleasants, and born the 3<HI>d</HI> of the ninth month 1695; being a youth of good natural parts, and well instructed in school-learning. His father dying whilst he was young, he was deprived of the additi∣onal advantage, of the admonitions and re∣straints of a worthy parent, so beneficial to the forming the minds of youth: Neverthe∣less he had an eye to the recompence of re∣ward, and about the twenty-ninth year of his age was called to the work of the mini∣stry, in which he laboured both amongst friends and other people much to satisfacti∣on, having meetings where none had been held before. Once, in company with his brother Robert Jordan, he visited friends on the western shore of Maryland, and also at∣tended the yearly-meeting at Choptank, on the eastern shore. His services seemed much confined to his own country, where, tho' the number of friends was small, he was not discouraged thereat, but endeavoured to discharge his duty amongst them, not only at the adjacent meetings but those more at a distance, and was made instrumental in convincing several in the upper parts of the colony, as well as in settling two or three meetings. A few years before his de∣cease, he wrote an epistle, directed to friends
<PB N="129" REF="020377_0136_0FAF0869F192EEE8"/>
in every station, but more particularly to the ministers, thereby further demonstra∣ting that his diligence and labours proceed∣ed from an earnest concern for the promo∣tion of truth and a right gospel ministry. He was indeed a man much devoted to the service of truth, and a considerable sufferer for bearing his testimony against priests-wages, having once been a prisoner on that account. He married Mary the daughter of Robert Jordan of Nancemond county, and left a numerous offspring, some of them young, for whose eternal welfare he was particularly solicitous; being once on a visit to friends at some distance from home, he was taken very ill, and seemed desirous that he might finish his course among his dear children, in order that he might have an opportunity at that awful period, of enfor∣cing his experienced advices to them, and promoting the cause of God to which he was much devoted to the last. Accordingly he departed this life at his own house the 24<HI>th</HI> of the eleventh month 1744, and on the 28<HI>th</HI> of the same month was interr'd in the family burying-ground at Curles, attended by a numerous company of friends and neighbours.</P>

<HEAD>A Testimony from <HI>Gwynedd</HI> Monthly-Meeting in <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> concerning <HI>CADWALLA∣DER EVANS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HE was a native of the principality of Wales, and arrived in Pennsylvania in the year 1698. And altho' he was not then in profession with friends, yet he soon after entered into close fellowship with them, and continued stedfast to his end. He was a diligent and seasonable attender of our re∣ligious meetings: On first days particular∣ly, he was ready an hour before the time appointed, and then read several chapters in the bible or some religious book: As the time approached, he would frequently ob∣serve the time of day, and by means of such watchful care, he was seated in meet∣ings one of the first, and scarcely ever af∣ter the time appointed. The gravity and composure of his countenance as he sat in silence, was no less remarkable than his punctual attendance, and bespoke such in∣ward recollection and divine engagement of mind, as often attracted the eyes and affected the hearts of others.</P>
<P>He received a gift in the ministry, in the exercise whereof, he was generally led to speak of his own experience in religion and the christian warfare; and his testimony, tho' short, was instructive, lively, and ma∣nifestly attended with divine sweetness: Notwithstanding it was always acceptable,
<PB N="131" REF="020377_0138_0FAF086B348B4370"/>
he was very cautious of appearing, lest any, as he often said, should be drawn from a right concern of mind, to place their de∣pendance on words.</P>
<P>He was zealously concerned for the ho∣nour and promotion of truth, and support of our christian discipline; and being en∣dued with discerning, and clear judgment tempered with charity, he was very useful in many services of the church, especially that weighty one of visiting friends in their families. And altho' he was naturally of a warm disposition, yet a tender regard to the service of truth, and a continual awe of the divine presence presided in his heart, insomuch that meekness and condescention were conspicuous in his conduct.</P>
<P>There was a freedom and affability in his behaviour and conversation, which indicat∣ed a benevolence of heart, and endeared him, not only to the <HI>houshold of faith,</HI> but also to the profligate and vain; rendering him serviceable in composing differences, and in comforting the sick and afflicted; and par∣ticularly in that skilful and tender office of healing discord in private families, wherein his endeavours were remarkably successful. In such services, he spent much of the lat∣ter part of his life, riding about from one house to another; and where no cause of re∣prehension appeared, he interspersed his dis∣course on common affairs, with useful hints, solid remarks, and lessons of instruction. But where admonition or comfort were ne∣cessary,

the propriety of his advice and the uprightness of his life, added weight to his labours, and seldom failed of good effects.</P>
<P>In private life, few had a better claim to the virtues of temperance, justice, industry and frugality, and as he well knew how advan∣tageous it was, "To train up a child in the way he should walk," he took frequent op∣portunities to drop his experienced advice among those under his care. It was his practice, in winter evenings especially, to read the holy scriptures in his family, and was particularly careful that neither child nor servant should be from home at unsea∣sonable hours▪ being highly sensible how slippery the paths of youth are, and how numerous the snares which attend them.</P>
<P>He was greatly favoured in the use of his natural abilities, and enjoyed an uncommon share of health until his last illness, which was short; during that time, very many came to see him, who shewed great marks of esteem and affection; and even libertines whom he had often rebuked and treated with, were deeply affected with sorrow: In∣deed it was rare to see so many tears shed at a sick bed, more especially of one of his years, which gave a proof that he had not outlived his services. His soul overflowed with love to God and man, and being fa∣voured in his last moments, with a blessed hope and confidence, he was going to that place which God had prepared for those that

<HEAD>A Testimony from <HI>Kennet</HI> Monthly-Meeting in <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> concerning <HI>WILLIAM LEVIS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WILLIAM LEVIS, of Kennet in Chester county Pennsylvania, son of Samuel Levis an early settler in Spring∣field in said county, was born in Spring∣field aforesaid, about the year 1688, and removed to Kennet about 1718. By giv∣ing heed to the measure of grace bestowed upon him, he became a serviceable friend in the society in divers respects; was a good neighbour, kind and open hearted to his friends, and has left a good report.</P>
<P>His last sickness was the small pox, which was heavy upon him, but he bore it with much patience and resignation of mind to the last; saying, that when the distemper came into the house, it was no surprize to him, for he was freely resigned, and thank∣ful he was so, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or he could not of himself. The same evening he was taken sick, he signed his will, and remark'd how good it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a to be contented to bear affliction. One night, as those that watched with him were preparing something for him to take, he said, 'You shall see your endeavours for me will
<PB N="134" REF="020377_0141_0FAF087013710148"/>
avail nothing.' He continued in a state of resignation and appeared cheerful in the time of his illness. When nearer his end, he was concern'd that others might do their duty faithfully according to the best of their understanding, saying,
<Q>I have often thought at other times as at this, of the shortness of our lives and time here, and the uncertainty thereof, which ought to engage us to circumspection and faith∣fulness to the Lord, and I charge you here that are elders, to discharge your trust faithfully in the sight of the Lord, having your eye single to him, and let nothing of self rule, and then his work will be car∣ried on in love and patience. I could be glad to have an opportunity once more with my friends, but if I should not, I would have those present, to acquaint them with what I have to say, and press it home to the elders, that they may faith∣fully discharge their duty, and acquit themselves of that charge wherewith they are entrusted; and also that parents of children and heads of families, may faith∣fully discharge that great duty which is laid upon them, not only in being good examples to their children and families, but also to be concerned that they follow their footsteps, adding, it was a noble testimony that God gave of Abraham, <HI>I know him, that he will command his chil∣dren and his houshold after him.</HI> And if parents were concerned to teach their chil∣dren
<PB N="135" REF="020377_0142_0FAF087075D1D500"/>
and bring them up in the way of their duty to God, and less concern'd to deck and set them off, and provide things to make them look great in the world, it would be of far more benefit to them. And my desire is, that elders may walk faithfully as good stewards, not only in their own families, but to the flock which they have the oversight of; that so they may leave a good savour to the rising and succeeding generation. I am sensible that all those who are rightly concerned for the discipline and promotion of truth, will meet with trials from that libertine spirit which would lay all waste; these will say, that religion consists not in such small things; but I have observed, that one small thing makes way for another, and greater things will take place; and if there is not a careful watching against these small things, the eye that should be kept open to see the evil of them, will become darkened. But keep ye your places, and labour in faithfulness with such, if possi∣ble to gain them; but if after friends la∣bour, they will not be gathered, friends will be clear and have peace in themselves; but a blast will come on such troublesome spirits. And as friends faithfully main∣tain this their discipline, the Lord will preserve them, but if they neglect it they will surely suffer loss.</Q>
To some present who had been engaged in the service of visit∣ing families, he said
<Q>It was a good work
<PB N="136" REF="020377_0143_0FAF0871538B4BC0"/>
and desired it might not be forgotten.</Q>
At another time, being in a weighty frame of mind, he said,
<Q>There is an enemy bu∣sy to accuse the innocent, and prompts on the wicked in their wickedness.</Q>
See∣ing his affectionate wife and sister with some neighbours weeping, he said,
<Q>Don't weep for me, but be you faithful, and we shall meet again, for it is the hardest of all to see you weep.</Q></P>
<P>The morning before he died, he desired to be helped to the chamber where his eldest son lay ill of the same disorder, and sitting down by him, he charged his children to be dutiful to their mother, and have a care of doing any thing that would be a trouble to her, but mind to take her advice, and desired a blessing might attend them; ad∣ding,
<Q>My race is almost run, and I shall lay down my head in peace with the Lord; and if you are faithful (meaning his wife and children) and live in the fear of God, he will bless you.</Q>
After some time of silence, he said,
<Q>Farewell my son, the Lord bless thee my child, and thine after thee.</Q>
Being then helped down stairs, he sat in his chair, and after a time of silence, clasp∣ed his hands together, saying with a com∣posed countenance, 'I bless thee O Lord' Afterwards laying still in a quiet composed frame of mind, he grew weaker and weak∣er, and about the ninth hour in the even∣ing, departed without sigh or groan, like

<HEAD>A Testimony from <HI>Gwynedd</HI> Monthly-Meeing in <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> concerning <HI>EVAN EVANS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HE was born in Merionethshire, in the principality of Wales, in the year 1684, and came to Pennsylvania with his parents in 1698; under whom he received a sober religious education; but, being ear∣ly in life convinced, that a form of godli∣ness, without the real enjoyment of the quickening principle of grace and truth, would not afford solid and lasting peace to his soul, he therefore sought earnestly after it, and resigned his heart to the baptizing power of God, which fitted him for eminent services in the church.</P>
<P>In his constant attendance at our religi∣ous meetings, he was a remarkable example of unaffected piety; for whilst he sat in silence, the earnestness wherewith his soul "wrestled for a blessing," was obvious in the steady engaged appearance of his counte∣nance. He was favoured with an excellent gift in the ministry, which he exercised in solemn dread and reverence; and as he al∣ways
<PB N="138" REF="020377_0145_0FAF0872B9549708"/>
retained an awful sense of appearing in public testimony, he was particularly cautious and watchful, not to presume to speak without assurance of a necessity being laid upon him, and equally careful to at∣tend to the continuance of it: And there∣fore his "Preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in the demon∣stration of the spirit and of power." His service was rendered more effectual, by the distinguishing marks which he bore, of "An Israelite indeed, in whom was no guile," a plainness and simplicity of manner in word and deed, with a zeal seasoned witb divine love; and as he had large experience in the work of regeneration and the myste∣ries of the heavenly kingdom, as well as the snares of the world, he was thereby well qualified to administer to the states of the people.</P>
<P>He travelled through many of these colo∣nies in the service of the ministry, in com∣pany with his relation and dear friend John Evans. Their friendship was pure, fer∣vent, and lasting as their lives, and their separation a wound to the latter, the re∣membrance of which he never wholly sur∣vived. He also frequently visited the seve∣ral counties in this province, and more par∣ticularly many of the adjacent meetings in their infancy; wherein his unwearied la∣bours of love, tended much to their com∣fort, growth, and establishment in the truth.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="020377_0146_0FAF0873A42D0838"/>He was religiously concerned for the sup∣port of our christian discipline; and as he was always diffident of himself, he labour∣ed faithfully for the discovery of truth and a disposition of mind to embrace it; where∣by he was often enabled to lay "Judgment to the line, and righteousness to the plum∣met," whether in reproof to the obdurate, or instruction and comfort to the penitent. In visiting friends families his service was great; for being endued with a spirit of dis∣cerning and the authority of truth, his ad∣vice was adapted with great propriety and advantage, to the particular states and con∣ditions of persons and families. His con∣duct and conversation in common life, adorn∣ed the doctrine he preached, being a good example of plainness, moderation, and up∣rightness of heart.</P>
<P>He was abroad in the service of truth when attacked with his last illness; and as the disorder was slow and tedious, he attend∣ed several meetings in the forepart thereof; in some of which, his lively powerful testi∣monies clearly manifested, that the God of his youth who had raised him up an instru∣ment in his hand, and on whom he had relied all his life, continued to be his shield and support in the evening of his days and period of life; which was on the 24<HI>th</HI> of the fifth month 1747.

<P>HE was born at or near Tiverton in Old England, being a descendant of friends: His father died while he was young, and his mother brought him up to useful learning, being naturally of a quick and cheerful dis∣position, and his capacity large and exten∣sive. The prime and strength of his days, was, much of it, spent in folly and vanity, until it pleased the Lord effectually to touch his heart, and favour him with a close vi∣sitation of his blessed truth, which wrought a willingness in him to take up the cross, and submit to the Lord's righteous judg∣ments, whereby he came to witness a being redeemed from his former conversation, and was often zealously concerned to tell others, what the Lord had done for his soul. He was frequent and diligent in the exercise of his gift in the ministry, which was accept∣able; often signifying he was as one born out of due time: He was zealous in main∣taining the discipline of the church, where∣in he was clear and his labour very helpful and serviceable; very diligent in attending meetings for worship and discipline, where∣in he was exemplary by his steady waiting and lively labour that life might be wit∣nessed.</P>

<P>ALICE GRIFFITH, late wife of Hugh Griffith, of North Wales in the county of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, was one that feared the Lord from her youth, re∣markable for her modesty and plainness. When she was married and settled, she de∣monstrated a religious concern for the ad∣vancement of truth and welfare of the professors thereof; and being a woman of great integrity and uprightness of heart, became very serviceable in divers respects; zealous for maintaining good order and christian discipline in the church.</P>
<P>She was well qualified for that weigh service of visiting families, having, at such opportunities, to communicate of her own experience, and tell what God had done for

her soul; and under a good degree of divine influence, would often be drawn forth in opening divine mysteries, as if she had been in a large assembly, as many witnesses can testify, that have been sensibly reached, yea baptized by her religious visits; at which she was mostly full of good matter, well adapted and suitable to the different circum∣stances of individuals and families.</P>
<P>She was often concern'd to stir up her friends, to a close attendance of meetings, both on first and other days, as also to ob∣serve the hour appointed, being herself a good example therein, until, by old age and infirmity of body she was disabled, which was about three years before her re∣moval. And notwithstanding the circum∣spect life and watchful state she was observ∣ed to be in, yet in the time of her weakness, she was visited with great discouragements and dejections, as may appear by her follow∣ing expressions.</P>
<P>At a certain time she was heard to say,
<Q>Lord how long wilt thou withdraw thyself from me, and not shew for what cause I am thus afflicted; I have been ac∣quainted with thy righteous judgments, which were ever mixed with mercy; but now, my trouble is more than I am well able to bear, being almost ready to sink.</Q>
Again was heard to say,
<Q>Lord, where∣in have I offended thee; what part of my duty have I neglected, that thou shouldst thus hide thy face from me? Time was,

when my hope in full assurance was to rest in thee, but now I fear I shall become a cast-away.</Q>
At another time she said,
<Q>What have I done that I should be thus afflicted, Lord shall there be any end of my sorrow? Many sweet times and op∣portunities I have had when alone, but now am left as in the dark, fearing to make one step forward lest I stumble, he that once was my guide has now left me.</Q>
Again said,
<Q>I still desire to be willing to suffer whilst in this body, any thing thou mayest please to bring upon me, be the exercise of what kind soever, if thou wilt favour me with thy living presence; then Lord, shall not any thing be too near or dear to part with, or to suffer for thy name∣sake. Yea Lord, if thou should see meet to deprive me of my sight or hearing, health or speech, let me never murmur, but Oh! give patience to bear this inex∣pressible exercise to the end.</Q>
One morn∣ing, after calling her two daughters, she said,

<Q>Look on me doctor, I am like a bud cropt from the vine before it is fully blown, yet young as I am, I have something to repent of, which in health and strength we are apt to overlook, and flatter ourselves is no crime, which is, I have been too much giv∣en to laughter and jesting with those of my companions who fondly embraced and re∣turned the same,</Q>
naming one in particular, whom she expressed a great desire to see be∣fore she died, that she might warn her of the weight she now felt, not only in these two things, but in a third, which was, tak∣ing too much delight in dress. Then di∣recting her discourse to the doctor, she said,
<Q>Nothing, else have I to charge myself with, yet, dear doctor, I find it enough, there∣fore let me prevail with thee to take warn∣ing by me; I am sensible that some things thou art in the practice of, are full as dan∣gerous, if not more so, than those which now lay so heavy on me; that of drink∣ing to excess to oblige company, as thy excuse and many others is, yet thou wilt find it of greater weight when thou comes to lay in the condition I now am in, than now thou may think possible, thou wilt surely wish it had been left undone, with

About the twenty-first year of his age, he received a gift in the ministry, in which he was frequently exercised during the course of his life. His ministry was sound and savoury, attended with a good degree of that life and power "By which the dead are raised, and without which all preaching is vain." He was not tedious or burden∣some, but often very reaching and edifying to his hearers. In his life and conversation he was grave, yet innocently cheerful, and strictly just in his dealings, also a lover and promoter of peace, unity, and brotherly love amongst friends, of which himself was a good pattern. He was generally beloved during his life, and at his death left a good savour.

useful in her generation and a blessing to many. Her love and companion for the widow, the fatherless, and others in afflic∣tion, appeared by her often visiting them: She was one of the wise in heart, who was favoured to foresee the enemy in his ap∣proaches, and would rouse and excite her fellow-soldiers to use their utmost endea∣vours to repel his attempts, which was of∣ten done with desirable. success. She was also zealously concern'd for maintaining christian discipline in the church.</P>
<P>She was rightly qualified for the weighty service of visiting friends families, and at those opportunities was frequently favoured with something suitable to every state and condition, which was attended with bene∣ficial effects, especially on the youth. But such indeed was the divine savour which usually accompanied her discourse and con∣versation, one could rarely be an hour with her without sensible edification.</P>
<P>Her first coming to reside among us was seasonable, for we having but few ministers, the field before her was extensive, in which she laboured fervently, tenderly inviting those afar off to draw nigh, and querying with them, whether they knew what the Lord had for them to do. By the visitati∣ons of heaven and a blessing on her labours, many came to have their mouths opened to speak of God's goodness to their souls; whereby was verified, what she had declar∣ed at our meeting before she came to dwell
<PB N="151" REF="020377_0158_0FAF088153CD0BC8"/>
among us, though it then seemed improba∣ble, and some doubted the accomplishment thereof. To these babes in the ministry, she who had a large share of experience in the work, was not wanting to administer suitable precaution and advice.</P>
<P>She went pretty much abroad, visiting friends in this and the adjacent provinces, to wit, the Jerseys, Maryland, Virginia and Carolina, accompanied to the remotest parts by her near and dear friend Susanna Mor∣ris. In her more advanced years she visited Great-Britain, accompanied by our esteem∣ed friend Mary Pennel, between whom a near and strict union was preserved through∣out their travels; and she brought home very clear and comfortable accounts of her acceptable service in the gospel ministry, and her godly conversation in Christ.</P>
<P>After her return from Great-Britain, she met with great difficulties in respect to her outward circumstances, which she sustained with christian fortitude. A near friend of hers asking her how she felt under it, she replied,
<Q>While I keep my eye steadily di∣rected to the object worthy of our chief regard, it seems as if a wall was on each side; all is calm, and nothing hurts or annoys: But if I suffer my eye to wander to the right hand or the left, the enemy breaks in upon me like a torrent, which hurries me away, and it is with great difficulty I recover myself.</Q>
After this, she met with a very heavy affliction in the
<PB N="152" REF="020377_0159_0FAF0881FB2FC390"/>
loss of her husband, which she likewise bore with becoming resignation and com∣posure of mind. In a few months after∣wards, she fell into a lingering disorder; (the dropsy) and as in time of health she preferred the prosperity of truth to her chief joy, so in her illness she rejoiced much to hear of any young people ap∣pearing hopeful in the ministry. On the other hand, she would, even in time of great weakness, lament with anxiety of mind the low situation of the seed, and say Oh! what will become of us? Will this dark cloud which hangs over our as∣semblies, terminate in a boisterous storm to try the foundations of the children of men?</P>
<P>By the long continuance of her disorder, she was reduced to great weakness sometime before her end; yet it was evident, that charity, (to wit) Love to God and his peo∣ple, continued with her to the last.</P>
<P>She died on the 9<HI>th</HI> day of the fourth month 1750, in the seventy-third year of her age, having been a minister 50 years, and was buried at Gwynedd aforesaid; on which solemn occasion we had a good meet∣ing, the extendings of divine love being witnessed.</P>

<P>She was indeed a living minister, an hum∣ble tender hearted friend, a true sympathi∣zer with those in affliction, and as a nurs∣ing mother to those that were young in the ministry, her service was truly very ac∣ceptable, and her memory still remains as a sweet savour.</P>

<P>HE was born in Old-England, in the year 1683, and educated in the profes∣sion of the church of England; but as he grew up, he became uneasy with the ways and cere∣monies thereof; and being a diligent seeker after the true way of worship, in a short time joined with friends; soon after which, he left his native country, being but a young man altho' married, and coming over to Pennsylvania, settled in Chester county, and after some time, received a gift in the mini∣stry; by keeping low and humble, and at∣tending thereto, he became an able minister, having a particular gift in quoting the scrip∣tures and explaining them clearly to the un∣derstandings of the people. About the year 1738, he removed within the limits of our monthly-meeting, where his service was very considerable, being well qualified for the discipline of the church, and very ex∣emplary in attending meetings both for worship and discipline, and an humble wait∣er therein.

<P>We are concerned to give forth this testi∣mony concerning our ancient and worthy deceased friend Susanna Morris, late wife of Morris Morris, who was a member of our monthly-meeting near fifteen years of the latter part of her time: Her memory still lives, and yields a precious savour to those who are measurably sharers of that divine love and life with which she in an eminent degree was endowed, and was frequently made an instrument to communicate it to others, by a living and powerful ministry,
<PB N="164" REF="020377_0171_0FAF088CF1C80C90"/>
in which she faithfully laboured with un∣wearied diligence both at home and abroad, for the space of forty years and upwards, having travelled much in the service of the gospel both in America and Europe, made three voyages over the seas to visit the meet∣ings of friends in Great-Britain, and twice through Ireland and Holland; in which voyages and travels, the gracious arm of di∣vine providence was evidently manifested, in preserving and supporting her through divers remarkable perils and dangers, which she ever reverently remembred and grateful∣ly acknowledged.</P>
<P>Her life and conversation was innocent and agreeable, seasoned with christian gra∣vity; was a bright example of plainness, temperance, and self-denial; devoted to the service of truth and the propagating of re∣ligion and piety amongst mankind: In which ardent love and zeal she continued, until it pleased her great Lord and master in his wis∣dom to put a period to all her pious labours and travels, and to take her to himself, as a shock of corn gathered in due season, after a short illness of nine days continuance, within which time, on a first day of the week, friends at her request, held an evening meeting in her room, wherein she was wonderfully strength∣ened to bear a lively testimony to the ever∣lasting truth, setting forth, the ground work of true religion and divine worship, con∣cluding with a fervent prayer to the father of all our mercies, for the continuance of

<P>HE was born at Sandwich, the 28<HI>th</HI> of the eighth month 1690, but lived the greatest part of his days in Dartmouth and Rochester. He came forth with a living testimony in the ministry, before he was twenty years old, in which he grew very fast, and soon became an able skilful mini∣ster of the gospel, dividing the word of truth aright; zealous against obstinate of∣fenders, but to those under affliction, his words were as healing balsam, and his speech as dew on the tender grass. He strove to live in peace with all men, and was gene∣rally well beloved by his acquaintance and neighbours, more especially his brethren of the same religious denomination. He tra∣velled much in visiting friends in New-En∣gland, was very serviceable in strengthen∣ing them, and also made instrumental in convincing some of the blessed truth. A
<PB N="166" REF="020377_0173_0FAF088EC340E6A8"/>
diligent and seasonable attender of meet∣ings, and a lover of the honest hearted, but always hated hypocrisy in any. He twice visited friends in the western parts of America, going once as far as North-Carolina.—Before he proceeded on his last journey into those parts, he appeared resigned to the will of God, and much weaned from the things of this world; his kinsman Adam Mott accompanied him, and by testimonials receiv'd from several meetings, their service was well accepted. On his way homeward, he was taken sick at Oblong in New-York government, bearing his pain with great patience to the last; and whilst his understanding was clear, often mention'd his concern for the prosperity of truth. In the time of his sickness he wrote a letter to his wife, wherein he express'd his submission to the will of God whether in life or death, desiring she might experi∣ence the same; and in an especial manner requested her care in the education of their children, to bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord; keep them from hurtful and unprofitable company, and endeavour to instil into their minds the christian principles of patience, temperance, meekness and sobriety, that so they might be made fit vessels for the holiest to dwell in. In another letter wrote to his children, in the time of his sickness, we find these words,
<Q>I hereby let you know, that as I am doubtful whether I shall ever see you more, there rests something on my mind
<PB N="167" REF="020377_0174_0FAF088F35BE58B8"/>
to write to you by way of advice, which I greatly desire may not be forgotten, and that is, as you have a tender affectionate mother, who is desirous you may do well, therefore dear children, be obedient to her in all things in the Lord, and submit to her counsel and advice at all times in love to her, and also endeavour to live in love and peace one with another at all times, and let not any contentions or hard thoughts arise one against another by any means, but be helpful one to another, and be exceeding careful to attend week-day meetings, and encourage others also, and endeavour to let all things be in good or∣der in the church.</Q>
He would sometimes desire those about him to be still and quiet, that they might have a time to wait on the Lord in silence, and several times opened his mouth in prayer and supplication in a living and powerful manner; also exhorted the by-standers in the same life and power. Thus he finished his course at Oblong afore∣said, on the 7<HI>th</HI> of the tenth month 1755, in the sixty-fifth year of his age; and we believe he is admitted

<P>He was careful to attend meetings for worship and discipline, and when there, ma∣nifested a real concern to wait upon God for strength and wisdom, that so our meet∣ings might be truly profitable.

<P>His engagements in the exercise of the ministry, occasioned him to be much from home, yet his regard to his family was be∣coming his station both as a husband and a father; it was his frequent practice to fit down with them to wait upon the Lord, and we believe his faithfulness therein, was of considerable service.</P>

<P>OUR dear friend Peter Andrews, from West-Jersey in North-America, being on a religious visit to friends in this nation, deceased in this city; and the lively sense of his services, and the regard we bear to his memory, engages us to transmit the following testimony concerning him.</P>
<P>His first visit to us was in the eleventh month 1755, and his service and exemplary deportment will remain as a lasting testimo∣ny for him, and to the truth he preached, in the minds of many; and we have good reason to believe he was made instrumental, in a very particular manner, to the help and furtherance of some amongst us, whom it had pleased the Lord to visit with a fresh visit∣ation of his love. And by the information of other friends, who well knew him, and particularly our friend Edmund Peckover, who frequently accompanied him, as well as from our own knowledge, we are enabled to give the following brief account of his labours and travels, from the time of his arrival to his death.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="020377_0177_0FAF089396962E48"/>He landed in the south part of England, in or about the sixth month 1755, and came directly up to London, where he was kindly received by friends, and had very good ser∣vice during a short stay there; but being de∣sirous of being at the quarterly-meeting to be held at York, in company with several friends of London, he went as directly to the said city as he could well do, being near two hundred miles, and reached there by the 24<HI>th</HI> of the sixth month, at which time began the quarterly-meeting; and this our dear friend had a very memorable and weigh∣ty opportunity in ministry, in the meeting of ministers and elders at the opening there∣of; but, in the succeeding meetings for worship, was mostly silent; yet in those for discipline, was divinely led to set forth the na∣ture, good end and tendency of the same, and very zealously pressed to the keeping them up, in the same wisdom and power in which they were first established; evidently setting forth,
<Q>that they proceeded from that which gathered our fore-fathers to be as a pecu∣liar people unto God;</Q>
to the no small edi∣fication and comfort of many sincere hearts, who rejoiced greatly in having his company, which remains fresh in their remembrance; his services being as bread cast upon the waters, which, according to the wise man's observation, <HI>shall be found after many days.</HI></P>
<P>After the quarterly-meeting was ended he went to Pickering, where a very large meet∣ing is kept annually for worship, and had
<PB N="171" REF="020377_0178_0FAF0893B2B8D530"/>
seasonable and profitable service. He tra∣velled to many other places in that county, and friends were greatly refreshed and edi∣fied by his christian visit, though not always attended by public declarations in their re∣ligious meetings appointed on his account, which were mostly very large, and expecta∣tions high, yet his eye was to his great ma∣ster's putting forth. He often was led to famish that too eager desire after words; and in several public meetings he had nothing to say amongst them; which tho' a great dis∣appointment to many for the present, yet there afterwards appeared a signal service in it.</P>
<P>He was at Yarm, Stockton, Bainbrig, and several other meetings in and about the Dales; then came to Leeds, Bradford, Wakefield, Doncaster, and so into Lincolnshire; which county he visited pretty generally, also the isle of Ely, and came into Norfolk, and to this place in the eleventh month 1755, as afore-mentioned; was at most, if not all, of friends meetings in our county; then went into Suffolk and Essex, and returned to Lon∣don the latter end of the first month 1756, where he remained a few weeks, being ex∣ceeding ill; yet was at most of the meet∣ings in that city, and was very serviceable, with many other friends, in affairs particu∣larly relating to the society in Pennsylvania at that time.</P>
<P>He went back again into Essex, and so for Hertfordshire, some parts of Buckingham∣shire,
<PB N="172" REF="020377_0179_0FAF089474C22E08"/>
Oxfordshire, Gloucestershire, and to the yearly-meeting at Bristol in the fifth month 1756; and had good service both in meetings for worship and discipline, which was well received, and, it is hoped, made lasting impressions on the minds of many who had the opportunity of being present.</P>
<P>His indisposition still continued, but did not hinder him from travelling: From Bris∣tol he passed through some part of Glouces∣tershire, Wiltshire, and Oxfordshire, and got to the yearly-meeting at London in the sixth month, and altho' his illness continued up∣on him, was enabled to bear several living testimonies, in the demonstration of the spi∣rit and of power.</P>
<P>After the said yearly-meeting was ended, he came down to the yearly-meetings at Colchester and Woodbridge, where he was eminently supported to be serviceable in the churches. At Woodbridge he was strengthened to bear a large, powerful and affecting testimony in the last meeting of worship, to the tendering of many hearts, whose states were so effectually spoken to, as that it may be fitly compared to the ex∣cellency, and glorious situation which the Psalmist described, when he says,
<Q>How good, and how pleasant a thing it is, for brethren to dwell together in unity! It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aa∣ron's beard, that went down to the skirts of his garments: As the dew of Hermon,
<PB N="173" REF="020377_0180_0FAF089531A628C8"/>
and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion; for there the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for evermore,</Q>
Psalm cxxxiii. 1, 2, 3. It was indeed a most heavenly, precious, bap∣tizing season, (this being the last public op∣portunity our dear friend had) in which he was wonderfully led to set forth the progres∣sive steps the Almighty was pleased to make use of, in appearing to Gideon, confirming him in the certainty of his requirings, con∣descending to grant his requests in a very peculiar manner, and sealing them with his presence, and giving him victory over his enemies, as he was faithful to follow the blessed author that pointed forth the begin∣ning as well as finishing that great work, to which that extraordinary servant of God, Gideon, in his day was called; which me∣morable service of our dear friend, there is great reason to believe the great Lord, who prepared him for the same, was graciously pleased to fix as a nail in a sure place; and may it so continue in the remembrance of those then present, who are left for a small space yet in mutability.</P>
<P>He continued very weak in body all his stay in Woodbridge, being above five days, and no persuasions could prevail with him to hinder his setting forward for his jour∣ney, having strong desires in his mind to see friends in this place again; and to a par∣ticular friend he expressed his love so great to us,
<Q>That he thought he could willingly
<PB N="174" REF="020377_0181_0FAF0896399A98E8"/>
die with us.</Q>
He was favoured to accom∣plish it in two days after he left Woodbridge, though with great difficulty, and lodged at the house of our friend John Oxley, as he had done before, but took to his bed soon after he got in, to which, the remaining part of his time, he was mostly confined.</P>
<P>It being the time of our yearly-meeting, many friends went often to visit him, and he expressed to some,
<Q>That he was satisfied he was in his place, in giving up to follow the requiring of the Lord, in leaving his outward habitation, and those near bles∣sings of a most tender affectionate wife and dutiful children.</Q></P>
<P>The severity of his illness kept him most∣ly delirious, yet he was favour'd with some clear intervals; in one of which, being in a sweet heavenly frame of mind, he broke forth in the following fervent supplication, viz.
<Q>Oh! this poor soul hath been for many days on the brink of the pit of distress; but thou, dear father, dost not afflict thy children willingly, but for some great and good cause known only to thyself: Dear father! suffer not thy children ever to de∣spair of thy mercies, but that we may be helpful, as much as may be in our pow∣er, to one another in all such times of trouble.

<HEAD>A Testimony from <HI>Gwynedd</HI> Monthly-Meeting in <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> concerning <HI>JOHN EVANS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HE was born in Denbighshire, in the principality of Wales, in the year 1689, and arrived in Pennsylvania with his parents in 1698, under whom he received a pious education.—He was a man of good natural understanding and favoured early in life to see the necessity of a diligent attention to the voice of divine wisdom, to establish and preserve him in peace with God; and by a steady adherence to it, he became honour∣able in society and eminently serviceable in the church of Christ.—In the twenty-third year of his age he appeared in the ministry
<PB N="176" REF="020377_0183_0FAF0898EE384298"/>
of the gospel, his deportment therein was reverent as became a mind sensible of the awful importance of the service. He had a clear engaging manner of delivery, was deep in heavenly mysteries, and plain in de∣claring them; being well acquainted with the holy scriptures, he was made skilful in opening the doctrines therein contain'd, and was often led to draw lively and instructive similitudes from the visible creation. He travelled through most of the northern co∣lonies in the service of truth, and several times thro' this province.—He was often drawn to attend general meetings, funerals and other public occasions, particularly the adjacent meetings after their first establish∣ment, over which he had a tender fatherly care, as a good shepherd taking heed to the flock;—and the great shepherd of Israel blessed his labours, and afforded him at times great satisfaction and comfort.—The latter part of his time, the visible declensi∣on of many from the life and power of truth, frequently made sorrow and deep lamentation his portion.—His labours were fervent with the youth, in much love and zeal, that they might come to know God for themselves, bow their necks to the yoke, and lay their shoulders to the work, saying,
<Q>That their remembering their creator in the days of their youth, would be as mar∣row to his bones.</Q>
It was indeed his great joy to behold the peaceable fruits of righteousness, and his labours for the pro∣motion
<PB N="177" REF="020377_0184_0FAF0899EA1EE5E0"/>
thereof made him honourable a∣mongst men of various ranks and professi∣ons, and his testimony generally acceptable to them.</P>
<P>In the support of our christian discipline, he was zealous, active and unwearied, and favoured with qualification to advise in dif∣ficult cases, which seldom failed of succeed∣ing. His testimony was close against hypo∣crisy and an outside shew of religion only, but full of parternal tenderness to the af∣flicted, weak, or diffident in spirit; of sound judgment, and deep in divine expe∣rience, yet modest and condescending, and being favoured with the descendings of the father's love, that at times appeared to clothe him as with a mantle; he had an open-door in the hearts of his friends, and an ascend∣ency over the spirits of gainsayers.—He was a zealous promoter of visiting friends in their families, was many times engaged therein, and his labours were awakening and useful; often employ'd in visiting the sick, the widow, and the fatherless and others in affliction; on these occasions he was sel∣dom large in expression, but his silent sym∣pathy and secret breathing for their relief, were more consolatory than many words; a considerable part of his time was spent in assisting widows, and the guardianship of orphans, which, though laborious to him, was of much advantage to them.</P>
<P>The importance of love and peace to ci∣vil and religious society he was deeply sen∣sible

of, diligent in promoting them both by precept and example, and successful in re∣storing harmony where any violation of it appear'd.—His conduct and conversation in private life was exemplary, and such as im∣plied an inward close inspection into the secret operations of his own heart.</P>
<P>He was apprehensive of his approaching end for sometime before his last illness, and told a friend,
<Q>He should not survive one year,</Q>
who admir'd he was so positive; but he made no further reply than,
<Q>See what will follow.</Q>
In his public testimony also, he frequently said,
<Q>He had but an inch of time to treat with us.</Q>
In the first part of his illness, he went to some meetings, one whereof was large, and he was favour'd with strength to speak in a powerful and in∣structive manner to the youth, for whose welfare his desires were ardent.—His disor∣der was slow and lingering, wherein he was favour'd with his understanding almost to the last; and altho', at some seasons, he was much concern'd on account of the gloomi∣ness of the times in religious and civil re∣spects, yet in general he possess'd a very great degree of calmness and serenity of mind, with a perfect resignation to the will of God, whether life or death should be his portion. On the day of his departure, ob∣serving his wife troubled, he said with a cheerful countenance,
<Q>I am easy, I am ea∣sy, and desir'd her to be easy also;</Q>
indeed it appear'd that the Lord had strengthened

And thus hav∣ing served God in his generation, he depart∣ed the 23<HI>d</HI> day of the ninth month 1756, aged sixty-seven years; having, we hope, shaken himself from the dust, put on his beautiful garments, and enter'd the wed∣ding chamber of the bridegroom of his soul, and enjoys the reward of his faithful la∣bours; was buried on the 25<HI>th</HI> day of the same month, in friends burying-ground at Gwynedd.</P>

<P>HE was born in Barking, in the county of Essex, Great-Britain, on the 1<HI>st</HI> of the ninth month 1696, came whilst young with his parents into this province, and lived some time in this city, from whence he removed with them to Plumstead in Bucks county, where he first appeared in the mi∣nistry; some years after which, he settled in this city. His gift in the ministry was liv∣ing, deep, and very edifying; and in the exercise thereof, he was remarkable for an awful care, not to appear without clear and renewed evidence of the motion of life for that service: And though not a man of li∣terature, was often led into sublime matter, which was convincing and persuasive, in set∣ting
<PB N="180" REF="020377_0187_0FAF089BF13A10E8"/>
forth the dignity and excellence of the christian religion, yet was very attentive that those heighths should not detain him beyond his proper gift, but to close in and with the life, which made his ministry al∣ways acceptable to the living and judicious. Although he was not led to visit the church∣es in distant parts, yet was sometimes con∣cern'd to attend some of the neighbouring meetings, of two of which he has preserv'd some minutes, which being a lively de∣scription of his concern of mind for the promotion of the cause of truth, it is thought well to subjoin them here in his own words.</P>
<P><Q>1756, eighth month 9<HI>th,</HI> I went to Con∣cord quarterly-meeting, but found no cause to espouse the cause of God in a public manner that day. The next day went to the youth's meeting at Kennet, which was to great satisfaction; my soul was so bended towards the people, that I could scarcely leave them, being engaged in a stream of the ministry, to extol the divinity of that religion that is breathed from heaven, and which arrays the soul of its possessor with degrees of the divini∣ty of Christ, and entitles them to an eter∣nal inheritance; also introduces a lan∣guage, intelligible only to the converted souls which have access to a celestial foun∣tain, which is no less than a foretaste of eternal joy, to support them in their jour∣ney towards the regions above, where re∣ligion has room to breathe in its divine

excellencies in the soul; here it is instruct∣ed in the melody of that harmonious song of the redeemed, where the morning stars sing together, and the sons of God shout for joy.—</Q></P>
<P><Q>1756, the 29<HI>th</HI> of the eighth month, I visited Gwynedd-meeting, where in wait∣ing in nothingness before God, without seeking or striving to awake my beloved before the time, by degrees my soul be∣came invested with that concern that the gospel introduces, with an opening in
<Q>these words; I think it may conduce to my peace, to stand up, and engage in a cause dignified with immortality and crowned with eternal life.</Q>
The subject raised higher and brighter until my soul was transported on the mount of God in degree, and beheld his glory; where I was favoured to treat on the exalted stati∣on of the redeemed church, which stands in the election of grace, where my soul rejoiced with transcendent joy and adored God. Returned home in peace.</Q></P>
<P>His conduct and conversation was inno∣cent and edifying, being much weaned from the world and the spirit of it. He was care∣ful not to engage in worldly concerns so as to encumber his mind, and draw it off from that religious contemplation, in which was his chief delight; which happy state of mind he maintained to the last, as evident∣ly appeared to those friends who were with
<PB N="182" REF="020377_0189_0FAF089D75D908C0"/>
him towards his conclusion; to some of whom he expressed himself in the following manner, viz.</P>
<P><Q>I am fine and easy, and don't know but what I may recover; but if I should, I expect to see many a gloomy day, but nevertheless I am willing to live longer, if I might be a means of exalting religion, that the gift bestowed on me, might shine brighter than it hath ever yet done, or else I had abundance better go now; for I think I have shone but glimmeringly to what I might have done, had I been still more faithful; tho' I cannot charge my∣self with a presumptuous temper, nor wil∣ful disobedience; but I can say, it has of∣ten happened with me, as with the poor man at the pool of Bethesda, whilst I was making ready another has stepped in. I am sensible that my gift has been different from some of my brethren, I have not been led so much into little things, but I am far from judging them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I have often to pass through the valley of the shadow of death, and have experi∣enced the possibility of a soul's subsisting the full space of forty days without re∣ceiving any thing, only living by faith and not by sight, provided they keep up∣on the foundation of convincement and conviction, and not turn aside to take a prospect of the world, and desire to draw their comfort from visibles; they will be supported by an invisible yet invincible

power; for he will be sure to appear, and when he doth appear at times, doth rend the vail from the top to the bottom, with an invitation, as Samuel used to say (mean∣ing Samuel Fothergill)
<Q>Come up hither, and behold the bride the lamb's wife;</Q>
then the soul will have to enjoy, and see things beyond expressing; my tongue can do little or nothing at setting it forth. The soul will be filled with holy admirati∣on, and say,
<Q>Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners.</Q></Q></P>
<P><Q>Although the soul has at times to be∣hold the glory, splendor and magnitude of the true church or spouse of Christ, yet those extraordinary sights are but seldom, not often: Though I have had at times, cause to espouse the cause of God, yet there are times that the soul is so veiled, and surrounded with temptations and fiery trials, and all out of sight, that I have wondered that I was made choice of; but I have experienced, that they that would reign with Christ must suffer with him; I never expect to get beyond it, while I am ;cloathed with this clog of mortality.</Q></P>
<P><Q>People may have a regular outside, and be diligent in attending meetings, and yet know little or nothing of it; for formality and externals are nothing; religion is an in∣ternal subject, subsisting between Christ and the soul: I don't confine it to our name,
<PB N="184" REF="020377_0191_0FAF08A0C57C82B0"/>
but amongst the different names there are, that my soul is nearly united to, who are in a good degree, I do believe, in possession of that religion which is revealed from heaven: And I am in the faith, that there will be them raised up, that will shine as bright stars, and religion will grow and prosper, and the holy flame rise to a great∣er height than it hath ever yet done. I can say with the holy apostle,
<Q>I have nothing to boast of, save my infirmities,</Q>
yet thus much I venture to say, that if I die now, I die a lover of God and religion.</Q>
And af∣ter expressing a compassionate sympathy with the poor afflicted churches up and down, con∣cluded with this saying,
<Q>Be of good cheer little flock, for greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.</Q></P>

about the year 1683, who settled in Thorn∣bury aforesaid. She was married to Vin∣cent Caldwell in 1703, and soon after they settled in Marlborough, Chester county, where she continued, and belonged to Kennet meet∣ing, till a few years before her death, when she removed to Wilmington. She was from her youth, remarkably exemplary for plain∣ness and sobriety, much concern'd for peace in the church and amongst neighbours, la∣bouring to restore it according to ability as occasions required, often with the desired success. She was very serviceable in that weighty work of visiting friends families, in which she had at times to impart to others, of her own experience in the work of religion, and to exhort to faithfulness and obedience to what the Lord requires; was a constant at∣tender of meetings, and exemplary for solid and humble waiting therein, and much con∣cern'd that her children might walk in the truth. After the death of her husband in 1720, she had the care of the family upon herself, remaining in a state of widowhood upwards of 37 years, in which station she behaved with such prudence and circum∣spection, that her conduct, in bringing up her children without much correction, is worthy of imitation; which together with her pious concern for the welfare of the church, entitled her to be accounted of the number of the "Widows indeed."

<P>HE was born in Bucks county, Pennsyl∣vania, of parents professing the truth as held by us the people called Quakers. About nine months after his birth his father dying, and his mother sometime after mar∣rying from among friends, exposed him to a loose irregular education; about ten years of age being put apprentice, where through eleven years servitude, he suffered great bodily hardship, and much greater danger as to the better part; yet (says he in a manu∣script lest for the use of his children)
<Q>I took delight in my bible, and believe the good hand was with me, that inclined my

mind thereto.—Tho' I followed lying va∣nities, and so forsook my own mercies, yet I could say my prayers every night, till I grew afraid to say them any more, and seemed like one abandoned from good for several years.</Q>
Having served his time out, he providentially became a resident in Benjamin Clark's family at Stony-brook, who were exemplary and kind to him;
<Q>I thought (says he) they were the best people in the world, careful in their words, yet cheer∣ful and pleasant, so that I thought I must be a Quaker.</Q>
And Edward Andrews, from Eggharbour, being at a quarterly meet∣ing at Crosswicks,
<Q>He came (adds he) with power to give me my awakening call; I was much reached, but after the manner of the world, looking at the man, gave him the praise, viz. he is a brave man, he preaches well, I wish I lived near him, I would go to hear him every first day; at same time not minding what he direct∣ed to, Christ in ourselves, the true teach∣er, that will not be removed till we re∣move from him; in us is the place he has ordained to reveal himself.—I afterwards went more to friends meetings than I had done before, and read much in friends books, but was yet in the dark, the time of my deliverance was not come, the sins of the Amorites were not full; I was un∣der Moses in the wilderness, come out of Egypt, but Joshua's time was not come, the Saviour, the warrior that brings

through judgment, and makes war with the old inhabitants; yet I sometimes long∣ed for something which I could not find, a lot in the good land. I think this year Thomas Willson and James Dickenson, came into the country, and sometime af∣terwards to visit the meeting of friends at Crosswicks, I happened to be at the meeting before they came in; the sight of them struck me, the heavenly frame of mind which their countenances manifested, and the awe they seemed to sit under, brought a stillness over my mind, and I was as ground prepared to receive the seed: James stood up in the authority of the gospel, and in it he was led to unravel me and all my works from top to bottom, so that I looked on myself like a man dissected or pulled to pieces, all my religion as well as all my sins were set forth in such a light that I thought myself undone: Af∣ter he sat down, Thomas stood up and brought me together again, I mean what was to be raised, bone to his bone, with, the sinews and strength that would con∣stitute a christian; I almost thought myself new born, the old man destroyed and the new man made up, concluding I should never be bad again, that my sins were forgiven, and I should have nothing to do but to do good; I thought I had got∣ten my lot in the good land, and might sit now under my own vine and fig tree, and nothing more should make me afraid.

Poor creature! I had only a sight, I did not yet think what powerful adversaries I had to war with; this has been the mise∣rable case of many, they have sat down under a convincement, and in a form of religion, some depending on former expe∣rience or former openings, some on their education, some a bare belief, and know∣ledge historical of the scriptures and prin∣ciple of truth.—Thus tho' I received the truth, yet I was like the stony ground; I received it with joy, but had not root in myself, my heart grew hard again, for when tribulations, persecutions, tempta∣tions and trials came upon me, I fell. Oh! how I moped at times and wandered about as a prisoner at large, I would have run, but I could not, my offended judge, my accuser was in me, I could not fly from him; yet, great goodness was near, and his power kept me from gross evils in a great degree.—I kept pretty much to meet∣ings, but there was such a mixture of un∣digested matter in me, it was not to be soon separated. Oh! the necessity there was, and still is of a continual watch against our soul's enemies both within and without.</Q></P>
<P>Having passed thro' various probations, he had considerable openings of the divine sense of the scriptures, and also saw that the Lord had a work for him to do, to which he at length gave up, and being faithful therein, was made helpful to many, being

enlarged and sound in testimony, and at times very particularly led to explain pas∣sages in the scriptures, to the comfort and information of hearers.</P>
<P>He was an affectionate husband and pa∣rent, diligent in attending meetings for worship and discipline, and manifested there∣in a zealous concern for the promotion and honour of truth, waiting for wisdom to see his duty, and strength to perform it.—He divers times travelled abroad on this conti∣nent in the service of truth, and frequently to the neighbouring meetings to satisfaction; his outward circumstances being at times difficult, gave him an opportunity to shew an example of christian resignation, and to see its effects in divers providential assistances.</P>
<P>In 1756 he laid before this meeting a re∣ligious concern to visit friends in Great-Bri∣tain, which had been on his mind upwards of ten years, wherewith the meeting con∣curring, he had our certificate, and embark∣ing, landed in Ireland; and after visiting the meetings in that country, arrived in England and performed his religious visit in several counties, but was taken ill, and died in London the 26<HI>th</HI> of the first month 1758; finishing his days work with a firm assurance that the gates of Heaven were opened to him; very acceptable accounts of his ser∣vices both in England and Ireland have been received, as are more fully set forth in the annexed testimony of Devonshire house monthly-meeting concerning him.</P>

in this city, his labour of love in the work of the ministry, being to edification and comfort, was truly acceptable.—After at∣tending the yearly-meetings of Colchester, Woodbridge, Norwich and the quarterly-meeting of York, he visited many meetings in the northern and midland counties, from whence good accounts have been received of his weighty and affecting labours. He return¦ed to London the lattter end of the twelfth month 1757. Having travelled with great diligence and laboured fervently, his health was impaired; nevertheless he attended meet∣ings till his disorder increased so as to render him incapable of further service.</P>
<P>As this our dear friend spent but little time in this city, we cannot from knowledge and experience give such a testimony con∣cerning him as might be thought requisite; yet, as some of us partook of the benefit of his religious labours, we find ourselves engaged to give forth this testimony con∣cerning him.</P>

<P>He was strong in judgment, found in doctrine, deep in divine things; often ex∣plaining, in a clear and lively manner, the hidden misteries wrapt up in the sayings of Christ, the prophets and apostles; and it
<PB N="193" REF="020377_0200_0FAF0779107EBF70"/>
may truly be said, he was well instructed in the kingdom, bringing forth, out of his treasure, things new and old.</P>
<P>His ministry was in plainness of speech, and attended with divine authority, reach∣ing the witness of God in man, and to the habitation of the mourners in Zion; fre∣quently pointing out, in a lively manner, the paths of the exercised travellers, and the steps of heavenly pilgrims; by which he was made helpful to such as are seeking the true rest, which the Lord hath prepared for his people. It may truly be said, he was eminently gifted for the work of the present day, remarkably qualified to expose the mystery of iniquity, and to point out wherein true godliness consisted.</P>
<P>His distemper increasing, he was confined to his bed, at the house of our friend Tho∣mas Jackson, in Devonshire-square, where all necessary care was taken of him. Du∣ring his illness, he was very sweet and ten∣der in his spirit, and remarkably patient. He uttered many comfortable and heavenly expressions, and several times said,
<Q>He apprehended his time in this world would be but short;</Q>
and seemed fully resigned to quit mortality, having an evidence,
<Q>That he should be clothed upon with immorta∣lity, and be united to the heavenly host.</Q></P>
<P>He had frequently been heard to say, in time of health,
<Q>That he thought he should lay down his body in this nation, and not see his friends in America more;</Q>
to which

Being taken with an excess of bleeding at the nose, she was thereby so weakened that for some months before her decease, she did not go from home nor much out of doors; she apprehended her end was near, and when it was proposed to send to a doctor for help, she said, 'It seemed need∣less, for I am in the hands of the great phy∣sician who knows what is best for me.'

<P>JANE JONES, wife of John Jones of Montgomery township, was educated amongst friends, and as she grew in years, she increased in divine knowledge, and be∣came a serviceable member of the church. The affability and sweetness of her dispositi∣on, and her love to all, render'd her very near, not only to the faithful, but many others also. As a parent, she was much more concern'd for her children's eternal welfare, than for their acquiring of wealth or preferments in this world. And as she possessed affluence and plenty herself, the sensibility of her heart towards the needy, would not permit her to eat her morsel alone. She sought for the poor, and distributed bountifully to their wants. As she advanc∣ed to old age, she became frail, and subject to pain and disorders, which disabled her from attending meetings as duly as she de∣sired; nevertheless her love to truth and the prosperity of Zion brightened and increased, and she bore her weakness with patience, as a dispensation permitted for her probation.</P>

As he grew in years, he became more and more serviceable amongst friends, being several years an overseer of Haddonfield meeting, and likewise an elder; careful to maintain the discipline.

She was a minister above seventy years; her testimony, tho' generally short, was mostly to satisfaction and edification; and in her declining age, when nature seem∣ed almost spent, she appeared more divinely favoured than common, to the admiration of some.

<P>HE was born the 27<HI>th</HI> of the first month 1687, near Bala, in Merionethshire, in the principality of Wales, and removed with his parents into Pennsylvania about the year 1697; soon after their arrival, he was placed with a friend until he came of age, in this time of his youth, he was naturally very wild and airy, and delighted much in vain company, until by convictions he broke off from his companions. In the year 1710 he married, and soon after settled at Uwch∣lan in Chester county, where he remained until his decease.

Although she did not travel much abroad, yet she was diligent in attending meetings at and about home, being endued with a sound and living ministry, clear and distinct in her testimony, whereby many were alarmed, some convinced, strengthen∣ed and confirmed in the faith through a blessing on her labours. She was much en∣gaged in silent humble waiting on the Lord, who was pleased to own her, and often raise in her memorials and songs of thanksgiving to the God of all mercies, who never for∣sook his people in the deep, nor left them to perish in the wilderness, but was faithful and true, and failed not to bring to the pro∣mised land. The gospel truths she was en∣abled to open, were so affecting to many, that some who were prejudiced against wo∣men's preaching, have been heard to say,
<Q>If such a thing could be, she was a true gospel minister.</Q></P>
<P>She was a pattern of humility, not seek∣ing applause, nor forward in her public ap∣pearances, and tho' sometimes large, was

But being of a backward spirit, from a sense of her own weakness, was loath to give up to travel in truth's ser∣vice, which often brought her very low un∣der such exercises. She sometimes travelled in Pennsylvania and Maryland, of which service we had comfortable accounts, and was also useful in building up the church within the limits of our monthly-meeting.</P>
<P>She was very lively to the last, and her testimonies were accompanied with power that made them truly seasonable to the au∣ditory, the divine presence being sensibly with her, under a sense whereof she was very much resigned, and rather desirous to depart and be at rest with the Lord. On being asked how she was, she answered with much calmness,
<Q>I am in great pain of bo∣dy, but quite easy in mind, free to depart and be released from my various exercises; and feel as if my day's work was done, and that I might lay down this tabernacle in peace. But Oh! the pain at times is so great, nature is ready to shrink, and am

<P>ELEANOR SHOTWELL, late wife of Jacob Shotwell of Rahway, was a ten∣der hearted friend, and encouraged such as sought the Lord. She was an elder of sound judgment, concern'd for the church's wel∣fare, and that Zion might be restored to her primitive beauty, and was a pattern of plain∣ness and self-denial. In the ninth month 1762, being on her journey to attend the year∣ly-meeting at Philadelphia, a friend mention∣ed the danger of going to said city, on account of an infectious distemper then prevalent there; to which she replied,
<Q>She had no fear on that account, and that it was no matter where we departed the world, so that we were in our duty.</Q>
She according∣ly went to the meeting and attended the sit∣tings of it, until she was suddenly seized with a violent disorder, attended with ex∣treme pain near three days, which she bore with a calm and even mind. To a friend who visited her, she said,
<Q>She was almost gone, and in great pain of body, but ex∣ceeding peace of mind.</Q>
At another time said,
<Q>It was satisfactory that her peace was made with the Lord, and that it would be terrible to have a wounded conscience at such a time to struggle with.</Q>
Concerning her husband and children whom she dearly
<PB N="217" REF="020377_0224_0FAF078EB82C0140"/>
loved, she said,
<Q>Though she was not like to see them more, she was glad in the Lord, that she had given up to attend the yearly-meeting;</Q>
expressing her desire,
<Q>That her offspring should be brought up in plain∣ness, and that friends watchful care might be over them; and that her husband might be preserved in self-denial, and humble re∣signation to the Lord's will in all his trials.</Q></P>
<P>She departed this life, on the 2<HI>d</HI> day of the tenth month 1762, in the forty-sixth year of her age, and was interr'd in friends burying-ground at Philadelphia.</P>

<HEAD>A Testimony from <HI>Burlington</HI> Monthly-Meeting in <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> concerning <HI>PETER FEARON.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HE was the son of John and Elizabeth Fearon, of Great-Broughton, in Cum∣berland, and born in or about the year 1683. He came amongst friends on a prin∣ciple of convincement, during his appren∣ticeship with his uncle Peter Fearon, and appeared in a few words in meetings before he was twenty years of age. In the latter end of 1703, with the concurrence of friends, he left England, and landed in Virginia, where he staid about three months, then came to Burlington in the second month 1704, and from that time until his decease, he was a useful member of this meeting.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="020377_0225_0FAF07919C55DC48"/>Between the years 1704 and 1730, he travelled in the service of the gospel, through most parts of this continent where meetings were then settled, and to some provinces se∣veral times; and employed above two years in visiting friends in England, Scotland and Ireland; returning with satisfactory certifi∣cates of the approbation and unity of friends with his religions labours.</P>
<P>After those travels, his worldly circum∣stances being attended with difficulties, and his desires earnest that he might get through them with credit, he went many voyages to sea as a factor, chiefly to Boston and the island of Barbados; and thro' many diffi∣culties, he was enabled to pay his debts, and to save sufficient, with industry and care, to yield a comfortable subsistance in old age, and to be helpful to some others. In those undertakings he took certificates, and re∣turned such as were very satisfactory, both of his diligence in his outward business, and of his care to edify the churches with the gift of ministry which had been committed to him. Whilst in Barbados in the begin∣ning of 1746, a concern came upon him to visit friends on Tortola, which by their large and full certificate, appears to have been very seasonable; and was the first after our worthy friends Thomas Chalkley, John Cadwallader and John Estaugh, had laid down their heads in peace among them. They say,
<Q>He came in a needful time, as
<PB N="219" REF="020377_0226_0FAF07928E844F00"/>
a cloud full of rain upon a thirsty land, greatly to our mutual comfort and joy in the Lord, and in one another.</Q></P>
<P>One of his last voyages by sea, was in 1750, and on purpose to perform a religious visit to friends in Barbados and Tortola, having our friend Thomas Lancaster for his companion; and when they had performed their service, the said friend was, after a sharp sickness, removed by death at sea. Besides this, he met with other sore trials in his pilgrimage through life, particularly in the long confinement of his wife, who was seized with the palsy five years before her death, and lay most of that time entirely helpless. His behaviour towards her, was as an affectionate husband, with much ten∣derness and care; and indeed his frequent practice of visiting the sick and afflicted, evidenced a sympathizing heart, and was very becoming his station.</P>
<P>He was preserved in the exercise of his ministry, in much love and gospel simplici∣ty. And his sense of the nature and spirit in which the discipline should be managed, is thus express'd in an epistle which he wrote to friends on Tortola, viz.
<Q>That you may grow up together a spiritual house that holiness becomes, and a care according to gospel order may be kept to amongst you, and that no harshness be used one towards another, but tender and helpful, and not apt to judge or censure one another, that you may be kept in that universal spirit
<PB N="220" REF="020377_0227_0FAF0793CB9F6338"/>
of love, that seeks the good of all and hurt of none, and yet gives all their due, and what is right and just.</Q></P>
<P>His diligence in attending religious meet∣ings was remarkable, for though he lived three miles from the particular meeting of Burlington to which he belonged, it was very uncommon for bodily infirmities, or any extremities of weather to keep him at home on meeting days; and the year before his decease, he visited several general meet∣ings both in this and the neighbouring pro∣vinces.</P>
<P>A life so spent in fervent endeavours to promote truth and righteousness among man∣kind, was, we have cause to hope, in a suita∣ble preparation to be closed at a short warn∣ing. He was seized with a fit by his own fire side, which quickly deprived him of understanding, and about three days after he breathed his last, on the 21<HI>st</HI> of the twelfth month 1762, in the seventy-ninth year of his age, having been a minister about 60 years. He was interr'd on the 23<HI>d</HI> in friends burying-ground at Burlington, after a solid meeting held on the occasion.</P>
<P>Having observed strict temperance and moderation, he finished his course in a good old age; being an example of prudence and steadiness, which we desire may be often remembred, and usefully improved to the advantage of such as are left behind.</P>

<P>ON the 4<HI>th</HI> day of the first month 1763, died our friend Thomas Tilton, in the seventy-ninth year of his age. Some of whose last expressions were as follows, viz.</P>
<P><Q>That his passage was very long and hard, and many times prayed God to car∣ry him through, that his poor wife's trou∣ble was greater for him than she could well endure, and that he was not insensi∣ble, she laboured for him both in body and mind.</Q>
Some time after he said,
<Q>It was a comfort to him to see his children concerned for themselves,</Q>
and desired them,
<Q>To keep to their duties, for there was a falling away of some, but that they might not neglect theirs; that they would live in love and in the fear of the Lord, which would be to their advantage, but to live loose and wanton would make hard work on a dying bed;</Q>
observing,
<Q>That people thought too little of their latter end, although they think of it sometimes, it soon goes out of their minds.</Q>
Then pray∣ed,
<Q>That the Lord would carry him through,</Q>
saying,
<Q>His passage was very hard, and his pain and affliction great; yet his peace was steady, for the Lord did not charge him with any thing.</Q></P>

<HEAD>A Testimony from <HI>Rahway</HI> Monthly-Meeting in <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> concerning <HI>ELIZABETH HAY∣DOCK.</HI></HEAD>
<P>OUR friend Elizabeth Haydock, late wife of James Haydock, of Rahway, was religiously inclined from her youths and an early pattern of self-denial and plainness to those of her age and sex. Being called to the work of the ministry, it became a trial to her, and such a cross to her own will to give up to the Lord's work, that she was ready to give way to consultations, and on account of her own incapacity and frailties, to question its being his call; so that (as she expressed) could she have found peace, she would rather have chosen death than obedience; but finding the love of God, as it is abode in, to be stronger than the world, she yielded thereto; and confiding in the Lord alone, came forth an instrument of his own preparing; and continuing to walk in the way of self-denial, she grew in her gift, increasing both in understanding and utterance to the close of her days.</P>
<P>In her last illness, she signified,
<Q>She had near done with time, and was fully resign∣ed;</Q>
and departed this life, in the seventh month 1763, in the twenty-seventh year of her age, and the 4<HI>th</HI> of her ministry.</P>

<HEAD>A Testimony from <HI>Exeter</HI> Monthly-Meeting in <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> concerning <HI>ELLIS HUGH.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THOUGH few of us were personally ac∣quainted with this our dear ancient friend in the early part of his life, yet as we have information by good authorities, of some things remarkable therein, we think it not amiss to transmit some hints of them, with what hath fallen out within the com∣pass of our knowledge concerning him.</P>
<P>He was born in Merionethshire, in the principality of Wales, and came over with his parents into Pennsylvania, when about twelve years of age.</P>
<P>He was naturally of a very cheerful dis∣position, and for some time indulged himself in keeping company with such, whose con∣versation and conduct were unprofitable and vain, for which, though we do not under∣stand he was guilty of immoral practices, he was closely reproved by the witness of God in secret, and his condition being thereby plainly manifested to him, as likewise the danger of pursuing such courses, he did not dare to go any longer in vanity: but sub∣mitting to the reproofs of instruction, was brought under great exercise and godly sor∣row; in which state, the conversation of his former companions, once his delight, be∣came a burden and increased his distress; but avoiding to feed their light airy disposi∣tions, keeping his mind retired, and read∣ing
<PB N="224" REF="020377_0231_0FAF0796421831A0"/>
the holy scriptures, when they sought to entice him, had such an effect, that they forsook him, which was a great ease to his mind, in that it afforded him opportunity for a further search after the will of him, who in mercy had called him to glory and virtue. As he was thus engaged, after many deep baptisms and trials, it pleased the Lord, about the thirty-fourth year of his age, to call him to the work of the ministry; which was an exceeding humbling exercise to him, and many sore conflicts he had therein, through the buffetings of Satan; but by en∣deavouring to follow the Lord in the way of his requirings, help was administred, so that he at times, had to experience, that he gives
<Q>The oil of joy for mourning, and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.</Q></P>
<P>His chief inducement to come and set∣tle in these parts, was a strong draught of love attending his mind, which however he did not hastily give way to, having felt drawings hither near eight years before he came; of so great moment did the removing himself and family appear to him.</P>
<P>He was a diligent attender of first and week day meetings for worship, as also of our monthly, quarterly and yearly meet∣ings, even when age and infirmity of body rendered travelling very difficult to him. He likewise visited some of the neighbour∣ing provinces on truth's service, with the unity of friends; and by accounts which
<PB N="225" REF="020377_0232_0FAF0797352EFD80"/>
we have had from the places he visited, his labours of love were well received and ser∣viceable.</P>
<P>From the time of his coming amongst us, he was always one of the number, who went on the visit to friends families; which weighty work he undertook in much diffi∣dence of himself, and fear of a forward spirit, often saying,
<Q>That former appoint∣ments and engagements thereto, were of no account for future services; but that such as went, must wait for renewed qualifications to enter upon that work,</Q>
which he used to say,
<Q>He thought must be a good one, since it occasioned greater nearness, and was a renewal of love, both among visitors and visited:</Q>
And by ac∣counts received, it was so in a good degree.</P>
<P>In meetings for worship he was a good example in silent patient waiting upon the Lord, and when raised to bear a public testimony, it was with that power and authority, which accompanies a true gospel minister, and hath made lasting impressions upon some minds. Though he was of an exceeding tender disposition, yet being a lover of good order in the church, and well knowing the dangerous tendency of undue liberty, he both by precept and example, endeavoured to promote the former and dis∣courage the latter; in which he gave repeated proofs, that the near connections of natural kindred did not bias his judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="020377_0233_0FAF079822A47C08"/>His deportment being meek and loving, and his conversation familiar and instruc∣tively cheerful, gained him the esteem of most who knew him, of different ranks and religious persuasions. He was a nursing father in the church, and particularly so to divers whom the Lord had visited that were under affliction, whether of body or mind; nor was his charity in this respect confined to the members of our society.</P>
<P>He was an affectionate husband, a tender parent, a kind master; and having, by the blessing of divine providence on his honest industry, obtained a competency of the ne∣cessaries of life, was very hospitable, enter∣taining both friends and others freely and kindly, not with ostentation or for applause, but for the promotion of piety and virtue, and the good of mankind.</P>
<P>As his natural strength abated in the last years of his life, he appeared more bright and lively in his public ministry, both at home and abroad; and the day he was taken ill of his last sickness, at the funeral of one of his sons, which was the last meeting he was at, he was remarkably favoured in his public testimony to a large gathering of peo∣ple; and in supplication at the same meet∣ing, his great Lord and master was pleased to favour him with a transcendent view in∣to the beauty of holiness, crowning; a life, a great part of which had been, according to the measure received, devoted to his ho∣nour, with evident tokens of his being near
<PB N="227" REF="020377_0234_0FAF0798718E14B8"/>
to the kingdom of rest and peace everlasting. And the same evening he was taken ill at his own house in Exeter aforesaid, and con∣tinued for about eleven days, mostly in ex∣treme pain, yet bore it with patience and resignation to the divine will; and though he inclined much to be still and quiet, utter∣ed many comfortable expressions, some of which were taken down in writing. At one time he said,
<Q>It is a fine thing to have a clear conscience.</Q>
And one morning,
<Q>Here is another day, Lord so preserve me through it, that I may do nothing to of∣fend thee.</Q>
In the evening he said,
<Q>Lord bless this night to me.</Q>
And taking some∣thing to give him ease, he said.
<Q>He that turned water into wine is able to give a blessing.</Q>
After laying still some time, said,
<Q>Sorrow at night, but joy cometh in the morning.</Q>
And in the morning he said,
<Q>I remember a dream I had about fifty years ago, I thought I was in a room alone, just going to die, and as I was much con∣cerned and troubled because there was no one present to see me die, I thought the great physician of value stood by me and said, <HI>I will be with thee;</HI> and I have a lit∣tle faith, that he will be with me, and if I am favoured with my senses, hope I shall not give over wrestling for a blessing.</Q>
A little before noon he said,
<Q>Lord, this is the way of mortal men, when they come to lie on a sick bed, they crave thy favour, though at other times many are forgetful
<PB N="228" REF="020377_0235_0FAF079985B1C380"/>
of thee.</Q>
At another time he said,
<Q>Though affliction may not seem pleasant during its continuance, yet it worketh an exceed∣ing great joy to them that love and fear God.</Q>
And in the evening, being in great bodily pain, said,
<Q>Lord give me ease if it be thy blessed will.</Q>
The next day be∣ing the first day of the week, several friends came to see him before meeting, to whom he said,
<Q>Fear God and serve him, and his regard will be unto you, but if you neglect to worship him, he will cast you off for∣ever,</Q>
or words nearly to that import. And being fearful they would over stay the time for meeting, inquired what hour, saying to them,
<Q>Don't neglect the business of the Lord:</Q>
And when they were going, de∣sired,
<Q>They would remember him when it was well with them.</Q>
In the evening inquiring what sort of a meeting they had that day, and being answered, a good meet∣ing; he said with seeming joy,
<Q>The Lord is not limited to persons, but all that wor∣ship him aright shall be accepted of him,</Q>
or words to that effect. A little after mid∣night, being in great bodily pain, and from the symptoms, it was thought for about an hour he was departing, during which he appeared to have his mind retired to the Lord, and then reviving a little said,
<Q>This has been a blessed meeting.</Q>
The next morning taking leave of a neighbour, he said,
<Q>Farewell, and if we never meet again in this world, I hope we shall meet in a
<PB N="229" REF="020377_0236_0FAF079C14AB88D0"/>
more glorious place among the righteous.</Q>
The day before his departure his speech fail∣ed much, tho' he remained very sensible; and the last words he was heard to say, were, 'Lord in heaven receive my soul.' Then growing weaker until the third hour next morning, being the 11<HI>th</HI> of the first month 1764, he departed this life, in a quiet frame of mind, aged seventy-six years and some months. His corps was interr'd in friends burying-ground at Exeter aforesaid, accom∣panied by a large number of his friends and neighbours.</P>

<P>SHE was born in Radnorshire, in Wales, and educated by her parents in the pro∣fession of the church of England. About the thirteenth year of her age, going with her elder sister to a meeting of friends, who were sitting in awful silence, with tears drop∣ping down the cheeks of divers, it made such religious impression on her tender mind, that she thereby became in some de∣gree, convinced of the truth. About the sixteenth year of her age, she arrived in Pennsylvania, where living in a friend's family, and experiencing the renewed visits of truth, she became willing to come more closely under the discipline of the cross, and

Being di∣vers years under a weighty exercise to appear in public ministry, about the year 1722, she gave up thereto, and increasing in her gift, had in time, a refreshing edifying tes∣timony; being well approved by her friends at home, and frequently led into the states of meetings where her lot was cast; in the exercise of the ministry she travelled into the eastern provinces, also into Great-Bri∣tain and Ireland, where in divers places, she had acceptable service, to the strengthening some tender minds in the way and work of truth. Afterwards removing with her hus∣band to East Caln, they resided there the re∣mainder of their time; and several years before her decease, her understanding by reason of age, became weak, yet she was preserv'd in much innocency, having a love and regard to friends, and was always pleas∣ed with their visits.</P>

At a certain time giving some account of her own convincement, she said,
<Q>In her very young days, she was a watch∣ful observer of the conduct of friends at markets and public places, that she might see whether in their dealings they kept to the principle of truth, of which she was convinced; and seeing their words were few and savoury, their countenances and behaviour weighty, and that they were just and upright in their commerce a∣mongst men, it had a great tendency to confirm and establish her mind in the truth she had embraced.</Q></P>

<P>SHE was born at Burlington, in West-New-Jersey, in the year 1691, being the daughter of Charles Read, who was one of the early settlers of Pennsylvania under

the grant to William Penn. It pleased the Lord to extend his gracious visitation to her in her tender age, which as she submitted to and abode under, she happily experienced to lead her into a life of righteousness and great circumspection. About the eighteenth year of her age, she was married to our worthy friend Israel Pemberton, who united with her in a pious concern for the prosperi∣ty and prevalence of the cause of truth, her sincere love to which and the friends there∣of, she uniformly manifested by her kind sympathetic care as a "Mother in Israel." She usefully filled the station of an overseer and elder, being carefully concerned to rule her own family well, and that her offspring might have a portion in that treasure which faileth not. She was a true sympathizer with those under affliction of body or mind, de∣monstrating her sensibility herein, by her frequent visits to such, which were weighty and comforting, her conversation being so∣lid and instructive.</P>
<P>In the first month 1754, it pleased divine providence to deprive her of her beloved husband, in whom was removed, a father, a friend, and counsellor to her and the church; which close trial (after 40 years living toge∣ther in much harmony) she was enabled to bear with christian calmness and resignati∣on; having often to experience the reality of that truth left upon record,
<Q>A father to the fatherless, and a judge for the wi∣dow, is God in his holy habitation.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="020377_0240_0FAF079EB6F922A8"/>She continued her house open for the re∣ception of friends near and from remote parts, as it had been in her husband's time, particularly for the entertainment of those who came from Europe on religious visits to America, with whom she was often dipt in∣to much feeling sympathy under their weigh∣ty travel and exercise.</P>
<P>Few have been more zealously concerned, and diligent in the attendance of religious meetings, seldom allowing the inclemency of weather to prevent her; and continu∣ed to manifest the like concern when very feeble; which diligence, was, in the time of her confinement and languishing state, a satisfactory reflection to her, as her attend∣ance had been from a real sense and persua∣sion of duty.</P>

<HEAD>A Testimony from <HI>Gwynedd</HI> Monthly-Meeting in <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> concerning <HI>ELLEN EVANS,</HI> an elder of said meeting.</HEAD>
<P>SHE was the daughter of Rowland and Margaret Ellis, born near Dollegelle, in the principality of Wales, in the year 1685. She was favoured with a good understand∣ing, which being improved by a religious education and strict attention to the dictates of divine grace, soon distinguished her as one seeking after heavenly treasure, which made her in riper years, an honourable member of society.</P>
<P>She married our worthy and much esteem∣ed friend John Evans, of this place, to whom she was truly a help-meet, more especially in public religious services; for whenever she discovered the least inclination in him, to visit the meetings of friends whether far or near, she did all in her power to cherish and encourage the motion; she was also a great support and comfort to him under his spiritual conflicts about the time of his appearing first in a public testimony.</P>
<P>In her family, she was an example of piety and industry, rising early in the morning,
<PB N="235" REF="020377_0242_0FAF07A00DE839F8"/>
and encouraging others so to do, often observ∣ing that those who lay late, lost the youthful beauty of the day, and wasted the most precious part of their time; that the sun was the candle of the world, which called upon us to arise and apply to our several duties. When the affairs of the morning were transacted it was almost her invaria∣ble practice, except on meeting days, to retire about noon, with the bible or some religious book; where a portion of her time was spent alone; from which retirement she often returned with evident tokens, that her eyes had been bathed in tears.</P>
<P>She was remarkably well acquainted with the holy scriptures, as also the writings and characters of our ancient worthy friends, together with those of her own time; fre∣quently expressing,
<Q>The many advantages she reaped from often conversing with the dead and absent; endeavouring to cultivate the same disposition in her family, by often calling them together in the winter even∣ings, and requiring one of her children to read audibly in the bible or some other reli∣gious book;</Q>
repeatedly observing to them,
<Q>The benefit which attended preserving the characters of those faithful ministers and elders in the church, whose pious lives and happy dissolution, if held up to the view of posterity, might be a likely means of kindling the same holy zeal, and resoluti∣on to tread in their footsteps.</Q>
And as ministring friends (whom she truly loved
<PB N="236" REF="020377_0243_0FAF07A0BB0B2878"/>
from her infancy as brethren and sisters in gospel fellowship) in the course of their visits came this way, generally lodged at their house, at which times she seldom miss∣ed to prepare her family, and inform the neighbourhood of an intention to sit a while together in the evening; which select oppor∣tunities, many can yet remember, were of∣ten singularly blessed with divine comfort and edification.</P>
<P>Her diligence in attending meetings for religious worship, was no less manifest than her steady zeal for supporting our christian discipline, and that we might adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things: Ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was her zeal mixed with charity, for b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing long experienced how few were qualified to lay justice precisely to the line and righteousness to the plumbline, she thought it safest rather to incline to the mer∣ciful side; firmly believing that the grace of God which bringeth salvation, had appeared unto all men; delighting to converse with our uninstructed Indians about their senti∣ments of the supreme being; and often said,

<P>In her friendships she was warm and stea∣dy, and on her death bed earnestly pressed her children,

<Q>That if God whom she loved all her life long, had not enabled her to sustain it, she must have sunk under it.</Q>
This dispensation of providence weaned her from all tempo∣ral enjoyments. She continued attending meetings, and frequently visiting the sick and afflicted while her strength permitted, and when that failed, much of her time was spent in reading the holy scriptures and in meditation.</P>
<P>The early state of religion in this pro∣vince was a grateful subject of conversati∣on to her in the evening of her day, but upon turning her eye to the present time, she would say with a deep sigh,
<Q>Oh! what is become of the morning dew and celesti∣al rain, that used to fall and rest upon our assemblies.</Q>
For herself, she often prayed,
<Q>That she might possess a lively relish of truth to the last, and retain the greenness of youth in old age, which God was gra∣ciously pleased to favour her with.</Q></P>
<P>Her last illness began about a year before her decease, in the forepart thereof she felt a lowness and depression of mind, that caus∣ed her to cry,
<Q>Tell me, Oh! thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flocks to rest at noon.</Q>
But after some time, this cloud was remov∣ed,
<PB N="238" REF="020377_0245_0FAF07A27481A680"/>
and she was enabled to say,
<Q>He brought me to the banqueting house, and his ban∣ner over me was love.</Q></P>
<P>And thus, by remembring her creator in the days of her youth, and a steady perse∣verance therein, she was enabled to meet the king of terrors with a serene counte∣nance, and resigned her breath without a sigh or groan, the 29<HI>th</HI> day of the fourth month, and was buried at Gwynedd, the 2<HI>d</HI> of the fifth month 1765; being, we trust, admitted to the general assembly and church of the first born, which are written in heaven.</P>

<HEAD>A Testimony from <HI>Kingwood</HI> Monthly-Meeting in <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> concerning <HI>SAMUEL LARGE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>OUR ancient friend Samuel Large, de∣parted this life, the 9<HI>th</HI> of the sixth month 1765, and was buried the 11<HI>th</HI> of said month, in friends burying-ground at King∣wood, aged about, seventy-seven years, hav∣ing been a minister upwards of 40 years. He was religiously inclined when young, insomuch (as he related) that at times he thought he could freely declare to others of the goodness and merciful deal∣ings of God to his soul; but for want of giving diligent heed to the inshinings of that divine light which had measurably

redeemed him, he suffered a loss of that sweet and heavenly communion which he had been made a sharer of, and began to join with folly and vanity, which youth are apt to do; but in process of time, being revisited by an all-merciful God, he gave up to bear the cross; and about the thirtieth year of his age, was made willing to bear a public testimony, and declare to others what God had done for him; which testi∣mony was living and powerful, and tended to the refreshing and watering the Lord's heritage and people; being often concern'd where his lot was cast, to invite and per∣suade people to seek the Lord for them∣selves, that they might know the work of regeneration wrought and compleated in and for themselves. He freely gave up to spend both time and substance on truth's account when called thereto, having visited several provinces on this continent, and some of them divers times. He was a ge∣nerous kind friend, ready to do good to all, especially the household of faith, very ready in assisting the servants and messengers of Christ when travelling on that account; bringing up his children in the principles of the christian religion, and in plainness of speech and apparel, a great encourager of his family and others in attending meet∣ings, that they might discharge their du∣ties which they owed to their maker. In the latter part of his days, when old and infirm, he met with exercises and difficul∣ties,
<PB N="240" REF="020377_0247_0FAF07A5CCF63108"/>
yet we have good reason to believe, he was carried through them all, and died in peace with the Lord and goodwill to all mankind, and is enter'd into rest, and reaps the reward of the faithful, where trouble and exercise are at an end. He had a sight of his approaching exit, and gave orders that his burial should be plain. Some of the last words he utter'd, were to his wife, a few hours before he expired, when he said,
<Q>All is done that is needful, now I must leave thee.</Q></P>

Two days after∣wards, some friends going to visit him, he
<PB N="241" REF="020377_0248_0FAF07A6F55A3FB8"/>
mention'd his desire of having a time of retirement together, in which opportunity he express'd in a lively and sensible manner, his resignation to the will of God respecting his indisposition, and spoke of the great ad∣vantage it would be to the members of our society, if they were more drawn from the spirit and friendship of the world, and the eager pursuit after the riches and grandeur thereof; saying, that the professors of truth suffered great loss in a spiritual sense, for want of being often deeply inward, when about their lawful callings, labouring to have their minds retired, where true com∣fort and instruction is to be witnessed; and that friends who are heads of families, ought to wait for the movings of truth, to make way for them to call their children and servants together; and if this was but the engagement of their minds, way would be made for such opportunities beyond their expectation. On which and some other sub∣jects, he, at that time, spoke in a sensible humble manner.</P>
<P>At other times he frequently mention'd his uneasiness in beholding, that many of the professors of truth did not keep within the bounds of true moderation respecting cloathing and furniture, but rather pleased the natural disposition, to no real advantage, and consumed much precious time that might be profitably spent in doing good among mankind; saying, that if friends lived near enough to the inward teacher

that discovers things to be as they really are; there are many things amongst us termed small or trifling, which would ap∣pear inconsistent with the pure truth.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding his affliction was great, yet he bore it with remarkable patience, ap∣pearing more concern'd for the glory of God and the good of his church and people, than any temporal considerations: And fre∣quently express'd his resignation to the di∣vine will, being freely given up either for life or death.

<HEAD>A Testimony from the Quarterly-Meeting of <HI>Phi∣ladelphia,</HI> concerning our esteemed friend <HI>MARGARET ELLIS,</HI> late of <HI>Radnor</HI> meet∣ing, deceased.</HEAD>
<P>SHE was born in the principality of Wales, of parents professing episcopacy, and religious in that way. By a short me∣morial she hath left, of some occurrences in her life, we find, she was early visited by the almighty, which she expresses in this manner.
<Q>At fourteen years of age, the call of the Lord was to me, when seeing some of my companions carri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the grave, a concern came over my mind, with a consideration, whither their souls were gone, and where mine would be, if I should then be taken away; and that followed and remained with me for many days:</Q>
But being young and not willing to bear the cross, the witness for God was so far suppressed, that she gave way to fol∣low the vanities and diversions of the world; yet the Lord did not forget her; but some years after, the visitation was renewed, and then, she says,
<Q>I returned in earnest to look within, to my own state and con∣dition, and to the anointing mentioned by the apostle John, which opened clearly in my mind.</Q>
This brought her to a close exercise, and often in secret prayer, that the Lord would be pleased to manifest her duty. Soon after this, she went to visit a
<PB N="244" REF="020377_0251_0FAF07A90BE6B120"/>
brother at Dolobran, who had a short time before joined in communion with friends; and being at a meeting, she was further reached unto, and the thoughts of her heart declared by a worthy minister then present. Her father took pains to dissuade her from joining friends, and got several priests to assist him with their endeavours, but being enlightened to see the formality and dead∣ness of the profession of religion in which she had been educated, and the blindness and emptiness of their priests, she aquaint∣ed her father,
<Q>She would never come more to their church, unless it was to his and her mother's burial.</Q></P>
<P>In a few years after this, she found a con∣cern to appear in public testimony in friends meetings, and soon afterwards removed to this province; in which she apprehended a divine direction, believing the Lord would go along with her, which she experienced to her comfort, and was cordially received by friends; increasing in the gift bestowed on her.</P>
<P>She passed through various baptisms and trials in her young years in her native land, and many conflicts and exercises afterwards, yet experien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the arm of the Lord revealed for her help and support.</P>
<P>She was a sincere hearted woman, diligent in the exercise of her gift, which was in much plainness and simplicity. She visited the meetings frequently in some parts of this province and New-Jersey; and in the
<PB N="245" REF="020377_0252_0FAF07AA446E3378"/>
year 1752, with the concurrence of friends, embarked in order to visit friends in some parts of Great-Britain, which she perform∣ed, and was in several places engaged to vi∣sit many of the families of friends; which as we have understood, were acceptable and ser∣viceable. She was favoured to return, and continued lively in the exercise of her gift.</P>
<P>Being taken ill in Philadelphia, in the eleventh month 1765, immediately after our quarterly-meeting which she attended, after a few days illness, she departed this life. She had divers times, to her particular friends, expressed her desire, if it was the Lord's will, to finish her days in this city; and in her sickness expressed her willingness to depart, but requested she might be fa∣voured with some interval of ease from ex∣treme pain, that she might take her leave of her friends, which was granted her. She uttered many lively and savoury expressions in her sickness, was favoured with an evi∣dence of her future well-being, and as she lived in the fear of God, we doubt not she was accepted of him, and enjoys the reward of her faithfulness.</P>
<P>She died the 13<HI>th</HI> of the eleventh month 1765, in a good old age; her body was car∣ried to our meeting-house in High-Street, and after a solid meeting, buried the 15<HI>th</HI> in friends grave-yard.</P>

<P>SHE was born the 7<HI>th</HI> of the sixth month 1699, near Chester, in the county of Chester in Pennsylvania. When she was about five years old, her parents John and Hannah Churchman, removed and settled at Nottingham, in the county aforesaid; and she being religiously educated by them, soon became inwardly sensible of the blessed truth; and taking heed to its teaching, was early a∣dorned thereby with a meek and quiet spirit; was a great lover of meetings for the wor∣ship of God, and a humble exemplary wait∣er therein. About the thirty-fourth year of her age she appeared in the ministry, and being faithful in her gift, though she did not increase in many words, and but seldom appeared therein, being rather a pattern of awful silence, yet her testimony when she did appear, was remarkably seasoned with the baptising power of the spirit, which made it truly acceptable to friends. She was often heard to express her apprehension of the danger of words increasing in the church, without sufficient weight and aw∣fulness; and at different times, especially in the latter years of her life, both in pub∣lic testimony and in private, she spoke of a winnowing time at hand, wherein she ap∣prehended the chaff was to be blown away,
<PB N="247" REF="020377_0254_0FAF07AB2F2B0708"/>
and the church restored to as great, if not a greater degree of purity than heretofore; which is now fresh in the memory of divers persons.</P>
<P>She was an example of plainness herself, and careful prudently to suppress the con∣trary in her children, as long as they re∣mained under her immediate care, meekly dissuading in a moving manner, against any appearance of corruption in conversation, as well as the world's vain fashions and su∣perfluity in dress; firmly maintaining pa∣rental authority in this steady resolution which she never departed from, viz. that while her children were clothed at her ex∣pence, they should submit to have their clothes fashioned agreeable to her mind. She was no less remarkable for humility and charity, a promoter of good order in the church, and of true peace upon the right foundation; for which virtues she gained the general esteem of her friends and others.</P>
<P>Between the years 1742 and 1754, she visited most of the meetings of friends in Pennsylvania, New-Jersey, Long-Island and the Eastern-shore of Maryland. Her care to attend meetings was memorable and worthy of imitation, even when under great bodily weakness and infirmity, as she was for ma∣ny years in the latter part of her life, se∣veral of her joints being greatly affected with the violence of rheumatic pains; all which she bore with such patience and hum∣ble resignation of mind, as truly becomes a

<P>She was at meeting a few weeks before her decease, but feeling much bodily weak∣ness, she expressed her doubt of ever coming again; having at divers times before mani∣fested a sense of her end being near. About five days before her decease she was seized with a fever and inward pains, which weak∣ened her very fast. The night before she died she had several refreshing naps of sleep, and on awaking was often heard quietly to repeat these words,
<Q>A happy change, a happy change;</Q>
and about the 8<HI>th</HI> hour on the 1<HI>st</HI> of the first month 1766, she quietly departed, as one falling asleep, be∣ing cheerful and sensible almost to the last mo∣ments of life; in the sixty-seventh year of her age, a minister about 33 years; and on the 3<HI>d</HI> of the same month, was interr'd in the burying-ground of friends at East-Not∣tingham.</P>

<Q>Friends, if you love God, he will love you, and if you do not love God, how can you expect to be beloved of him?</Q>
Adding,
<Q>If you would gather your families more often together, and sit down in his fear, and wait in true silence, to have your minds drawn from this world, you would grow in the truth,</Q>

<P>He came over to Pennsylvania, in the year 1709, and some time after settled at Uwch∣lan aforesaid, and soon joined in society with friends, having for divers years before been under some convincement of the prin∣ciple of truth as held by us; and being measurably faithful to the manifestation of grace received, the Lord was pleased to be∣stow upon him a dispensation of the gospel to preach, in which we believe he laboured faithfully, and became a sound and able minister: His sitting in meetings for divine worship was solid and exemplary, often in silence, tho' at times when moved thereto, doctrine hath dropped from him as the dew, and his speech distilled as the small rain, to the refreshing the hungry and thirsty soul.</P>
<P>He was an example of plainness and mo∣deration, his conversation weighty and in∣structive, also very encouraging to such as were well minded; and divers small pieces sound among his papers, which appear as the produce of his private meditations, ma∣nifest that his conversation was often in heaven, and his meditation on heavenly things.</P>

<P>About the twenty-second year of his age, he bore a testimony against wars and fight∣ings, for which he was fined and suffered seven months imprisonment.

About the year 1714, a meeting for worship was settled at his house, which continued until a meeting-house was built in London-Grove township not far distant.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="020377_0262_0FAF07B39F9FFA50"/>He was one whom we think dwelt near the truth, having received the same in the love of it.

About the year 1697, he came over to Pennsylvania, and for some time resided near Derby, where he enter'd into a married state, and in a few years afterwards removed to the forks of Brandywine, then a new settled part of the country, the nearest meeting being about eleven miles, which he seldom missed at∣tending when of ability of body; he was also instrumental in settling this called Bradford meeting, within the compass of which he resided the remainder of his days. He was an example of plainness and self denial, and concern'd for the support of the discipline. He travelled into New-Jersey and the southern provinces where his ser∣vice in the ministry was acceptable, his doctrine being sound, and his life, conver∣sation and deportment adorning the same. When far advanced in age, his hearing and memory failing, render'd his usefulness not so extensive as in his younger years. For some time before his decease, he seemed very desirous of his change, often expressing,

after three or four weeks illness or rather growing weaker with age, he de∣parted in a composed frame of mind, on the 17<HI>th</HI> of the twelfth month 1767, and on the 20<HI>th</HI> was interr'd in friends burying-ground at Bradford.

<P>HE was early visited, and reached unto by the reproofs of divine light and grace, for those youthful vanities and cor∣rupt conversation, which by nature he was
<PB N="260" REF="020377_0267_0FAF07BAF9448D90"/>
prone to and pursued, to the grief of his pious mother, who was religiously concern∣ed to restrain him; but as he became obedi∣ent to the renewed visitations of the heaven∣ly call, denying himself of those things he was reproved for, he not only learned to cease from doing evil, but to live in the practice of doing well; and continuing faith∣ful, became an example of plainness and self-denial, for which he suffered much scoffing and mocking of those who had been his companions in folly; yet he neither fainted nor was turned aside by the reproach∣es of the ungodly, which thus fell to his lot, for his plain testimony against their evil conduct.</P>
<P>In the twenty-sixth year of his age, he appeared in the work of the ministry, and laboured therein in much plainness and godly sincerity, adorning the doctrine he preached, by a humble circumspect life and conversation, being exemplary in his dili∣gence and industry to labour honestly for a livelihood, though often in much bodily infirmity and weakness, desiring, as he some∣times expressed, that he might owe no man any thing but love. His inoffensive open∣ness and affability, drawing many of dif∣ferent denominations to converse with him, he had some seasonable opportunities of ad∣monishing and rebuking the evil doer and evil speaker, which he did, in the plainness of an upright zeal for the promotion of pie∣ty and virtue, tempered with true brotherly

kindness and charity; respecting not the person of the proud nor of the rich, be∣cause of his riches, but with christian free∣dom, declaring the truth to his neighbour, and was thus in private as well as public, a preacher of righteousness.</P>
<P>In his public ministry he was zealous against errors both in principle and practice, and constantly concerned to press the ne∣cessity of obedience to the principle of divine grace; a manifestation of which is given to every man; knowing, from his own ex∣perience, that it bringeth salvation to all them that obey and follow its teachings, and was frequently enabled with energy and power to bear testimony to the outward coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, his mira∣culous birth, his holy example in his life and precepts, and his death and sufferings at Jerusalem, by which he hath obtained e∣ternal redemption for us.</P>
<P>In his public testimony a little before his last sickness, he expressed his apprehen∣sions, that his time among us would be short, and fervently exhorted to watchfulness and care, to keep our lamps trimmed, and our lights burning, and urged the necessity of being prepared to meet the bridegroom, as not knowing at what hour he will come.</P>
<P>He travelled several times, and visited most of the meetings of friends in this pro∣vince and New-Jersey, and some in the ad∣jacent provinces, but was not much from home; being upwards of forty years a dili∣gent

<P>Afflictions of divers kinds, and some very deep and exercising, fell to his lot through the course of his life, which he was enabled to bear with exemplary patience and resig∣nation, and particularly through his last ill∣ness, in which, for upwards of six weeks, he underwent great difficulty and pain, be∣ing afflicted with the asthma and dropsy, so that he suffered much, yet was never heard to utter a murmur or complaint, but fre∣quently expressed his thankfulness, that he had not more pain, and often engaged in prayer, that he might be preserved in pati∣ence to the end, which was graciously grant∣ed him; so that he was capable of speaking to the comfort and edification of those who visited him; and from the fervent love of the brethren, which evidently appeared thro' his life, and most conspicuously during his last illness, and even in the hour of his death, we have a well-grounded assurance that he is passed unto life, and hath receiv∣ed the reward of the righteouss.</P>

<P>HE was born in Merionethshire, in the principality of Wales, in the third month 1687, and came into Pennsylvania about the twelfth year of his age; was early convinced of the principle of truth as held forth by friends, with whom he joined in communion, and by his godly life and con∣versation through the course of his time, was nearly united to them. His ministry was attended with divine sweetness and ener∣gy, labouring faithfully therein to the com∣fort and edification of the living whilst health and bodily ability continued; being a lively example of humility, plainness, temperance, meekness and charity, and of justice and up∣rightness in his dealings amongst men, which gained him the love and esteem of people of all denominations. He was a tender affec∣tionate husband and father, earnestly con∣cern'd to train up his children and family in the fear of God, and example and in∣struct them in the paths of virtue, and also manifested a true zeal for promoting and

<P>OUR said friend was born in England, of parents not professing with us, who brought him over with them when very young, and resided in New-Jersey in the early settlement of that province. Soon af∣ter he became capable of religious considera∣tion, he was convinced of the principle of truth as professed by us, on which account he underwent the displeasure of, and some severities from his father, but being steady and prudent in conduct, and faithful to his convincement, he at length so gained on his father's affections, that after some time he became reconciled and friendly to him▪</P>
<P>He became a member of this monthly, and of Abington particular meeting, on or about the thirtieth year of his age, and so continued to the end of his life, being al∣ways, when at home and in health, a con∣stant attender of those meetings, tho' living at a considerable distance therefrom.</P>
<P>When about forty-eight years of age, he appeared in the ministry, and became a faithful labourer therein according to abili∣ty. He had little or no school learning, yet delighted much in hearing the scriptures read, and often promoted the reading of them in his family; by means whereof and a retentive memory, he sometimes, thro' the assistance of divine grace, quoted texts
<PB N="267" REF="020377_0274_0FAF07C1F5712ED0"/>
from them in his ministry, which was not in the enticing words of man's wisdom, but in the demonstration of the spirit, often ad∣ministring comfort to, and true sympathy with, the afflicted and mourners in Zion.</P>
<P>He divers times visited most of the distant meetings of friends on this continent, and on his return produced satisfactory accounts of his services in those visits. He often communicated good and wholesome advice to his neighbours of other religious deno∣minations, amongst whom he was generally respected, as a good neighbour, and an ho∣nest, innocent, inoffensive man.</P>
<P>Altho' he did not appear to be much gift∣ed for the exercise of the discipline, yet be∣ing a constant attender of meetings appoint∣ed for that purpose, and a diligent waiter therein, there was a language intelligible in his solid silence, which communicated in∣struction to his friends, who were always well pleased with his company.</P>
<P>He was a promoter of that weighty ser∣vice of visiting friends families, wherein he was usefully engaged, even when thro' old age and bodily weakness, it appear'd to human probability too hard and arduous an undertaking; but having discovered a willingness to make trial, he joined with some other friends, and was supported with inward and outward strength to go through the service, to his own and his friends great satisfaction. After which his strength and faculties declining, he was mostly confined

<HEAD>A Testimony from <HI>Abington</HI> Monthly-Meeting in <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> concerning <HI>ISAAC CHILD.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THOSE who die in the Lord, cease from their labours and the troubles of this life, and ascend to the heavenly man∣sions, where they are forever blessed: And all that can be said on their behalf, cannot in any degree advance their happiness nor add to their worth; yet there is something due to the memory of the righteous, such whose lives have been conspicuously virtu∣ous, who have laid down their heads in peace, are gone from works to rewards, and left a sweet savour.</P>
<P>Our dear and well esteemed friend Isaac Child, having departed this life, we find a freedom to give the following testimony con∣cerning him while amongst us.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="020377_0276_0FAF07C3F1F1F708"/>In the year 1764, he, with his wife and two children, came well recommended to us from Buckingham monthly-meeting; when he found a draught and freedom to come and settle amongst us, and a favourable op∣portunity presenting, he was not hasty in his determination, but, agreeable to the good and wholesome rule of our discipline, laid the matter before the monthly-meeting he then belonged to, for their advice.</P>
<P>This worthy friend approved himself to be one who had submitted to the yoke and cross of Christ in his youth, and by the in∣fluence and operation of truth upon him, was made sensible of the necessity of living a circumspect and self-denying-life; and as he yielded obedience to the dictates of grace, being thereby subjected to the divine will and requirings, the Lord was pleased to employ him in his vineyard, and to qualify him for service therein, both in the exercise of the discipline of the church, and as a minister of the gospel.</P>
<P>He was exemplary in life and conversati∣on, his deportment being meek, humble and innocently cheerful, yet guarding against any thing that would tend to lightness in behaviour, his company was pleasant, and his words savoury and edifying: A tender affectionate husband and parent, a kind friend and neighbour; not of a murmuring disposition when he met with disappoint∣ments and afflictions, but freely submitted to what was permitted to come upon him.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="020377_0277_0FAF07C4AFE19950"/>He was zealous for the cause of God, and the support of christian discipline in its va∣rious branches, not hasty in giving his sen∣timents on matters relative thereto; but af∣ter deliberately waiting for a proper quali∣fication, he mostly spake close and pertinent, with clearness and soundness of judgment. He was concern'd for the close and due exer∣cise of the discipline against offenders, not willing that any part of it should be dispensed with, through partial favour or affection, but that true judgment, according to their trans∣gressions, should be placed upon them, the church cleansed from defilements and re∣proaches, and that the libertine professor and the circumspect walker might be truly distinguished. Yet he was at times, led in∣to sympathy and travel of soul for such who through inadvertency had missed their way, and were in some measure sensible of their error; to those he some times extended private admonition and counsel, in love to their souls, and with desires for their resto∣ration. It may truly be said, he was en∣dowed with a large share of natural under∣standing, which being sanctified by divine grace, he became well qualified for service in the church.</P>
<P>As a minister, be approved himself one rightly called to the work, having experi∣enced a growth from a good beginning to a large advancement, and at times, thro' di∣vine aid was enabled to deliver much ex∣cellent doctrine to the comfort and edifica∣tion
<PB N="271" REF="020377_0278_0FAF07C5AD2B3B80"/>
of such whose minds were gathered in∣to a true inward worship of God in spirit: And the negligent were exhorted to more at∣tention in the great work of religion and their souls salvation.</P>
<P>He often sounded an alarm to the rebel∣lious and gainsayers, with a warning to re∣pent and amend their ways, that their souls might be saved in the day of trouble. He had a clear delivery and ready utterance, his stile being familiar to the lowest capacities, his matter well connected, his doctrine sound, his powerful ministry having a great reach upon the people. He frequently at∣tended burials, both within the compass of our own meeting, and some more distant, saying,
<Q>It was better for him to go to the house of mourning than the house of mirth;</Q>
at which times there was often large gatherings of divers sorts of christian professors, where he frequently appeared in testimony, much to their satisfaction; being favour'd with a clear sight of the states of the people, and enabled faithfully to speak what was given him, in a close searching manner, without affectation, and in that universal love which wishes well to all men.</P>
<P>He travelled abroad but little, except to some neighbouring yearly-meetings and some other meetings adjacent. In his last public testimony, which was in our month∣ly-meeting, he was led to speak of the val∣lies that were to be raised and the hills brought down; that when the Lord was
<PB N="272" REF="020377_0279_0FAF07C889D7CE50"/>
pleased to raise some as out of the low val∣lies and adorn them with his jewels, it made t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m appear above their brethren; but when those jewels were taken off, they were then on a level; this was agreeable to his own experience, he having at times witnessed a being baptised into lowliness of mind and nothingness of self; under which he appeared much resigned to the divine will, often sitting in silence, as one who had neither call nor commission to speak; for he never discover∣ed a desire to be heard in words, until he had received a renewed qualification, in pure love, to speak to the people, and, as upon the walls of Zion, to proclaim the everlasting gospel of peace, and the means of salvation through Christ our Saviour.</P>
<P>In the time of his last sickness (which was about nine days) he was preserved in pati∣ence and resignation of mind; and near the morning before his departure, being clear in his understanding, and sensible or death approaching, he was drawn forth in fervent supplication to the Almighty: After which laying still for some time, he departed like a lamb, without sigh or groan, on the 5<HI>th</HI> of the fourth month 1769, aged thirty-five years, having been a minister about 11 years, and a member of our meeting near 5 years. A large number of friends and others paid their last office of love towards him, in at∣tending his interment at friends burying-ground at Abington, on the 8<HI>th</HI> of the said month, at which time a solid meeting was held.</P>

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING our much e∣steemed friend Isaac Child, removed himself and family from within the compass of our monthly-meeting near five years be∣fore his decease, yet we find freedom to give this short testimony concerning him, having been favoured to sit under many living and powerful testimonies deliver'd by him whilst among us.</P>
<P>We are fully satisfied he was one whom the Lord in his wisdom saw meet to make use of for the work of the gospel, having fitted, qualified and called him forth when but young, to publish the glad tidings there∣of; to which divine call and holy requiring, he gave up in obedience, and suffered not the things of this world to take up his mind, but in true fervency of zeal and love for the cause of truth, he spent much time in its service. His testimony was living, sound and delivered with divine authority; for he handled not the word deceitfully, nor en∣deavoured to please itching ears; but as a true servant of Jesus, waited to be renewed∣ly endowed with power from on high, where∣by he was directed to divide the word aright, and speak home to the states and conditions of the people: He was also zealously con∣cerned for the promotion of discipline and
<PB N="274" REF="020377_0281_0FAF07CB17A68508"/>
good order in the church; and for the ma∣nagement of the affairs thereof, he appear∣ed remarkably well qualified; his weighty admonitions being enforced by a pious life and conversation. May we, under the con∣sideration of the great loss the church has sustained by his and some others decease, be excited so to follow their footsteps, that with them we may be partakers of that in∣corruptible inheritance which is reserved for the righteous, when time here shall be no more.</P>

<P>HE was born of honest parents, and educated within the compass of this meeting; in his youth was somewhat airy, but when arrived to riper years he embraced the truth and appeared closely to follow the dictates thereof to the end of his life.</P>
<P>About the year 1740 he appeared in the ministry and experiencing a growth therein, he at different times visited most of the nor∣thern colonies, in which services he always had our concurrence, and at his return pro∣duced certificates of friends unity with his ministry and labours of love; the remem∣brance whereof yet lives as a memorial in the minds of many.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="020377_0282_0FAF07CB74CAD8C8"/>He earnestly laboured for the good and salvation of men, and tho' not learned, spoke with great propriety, yet plain and familiar, his doctrine being sound, lively and edifying, which being adorned by a pious life and innocent conversation, season∣ed with true charity, made him justly e∣steemed by people of all denominations.</P>
<P>He was steadily concern'd to promote good order and discipline, and therein to act uprightly for truth's cause without par∣tiality. With great cheerfulness giving up much of his time, and labouring for the restoration of such who had miss'd their way; and altho' he used great plainness in admonishing transgressors, seldom gave of∣fence; being a man of remarkable self-de∣nial and endued with much mildness, made him very serviceable in the affairs of the church in general, and tended to support the authority of truth.</P>
<P>In his declining years he was affected with bodily weakness, yet his zeal for the cause of truth did not abate, but the life and power usually attending his ministry rather increased. In his last testimony at our meeting, he was highly favoured, the power of truth rising into dominion; with much salutary counsel and fatherly admo∣nition he seemed to take a final farewell of his brethren, and fervently prayed for our preservation. As his departure drew nigh, he often express'd his willingness to leave this world, saying,
<Q>He did not know any

He departed this life, the 5<HI>th</HI> of the fifth month 1769, in the sixty-sixth year of his age; and as a good and faithful servant, we doubt not, is entered into everlasting joy and happiness.

<P>SHE was born in Philadelphia, in or about the year 1695, her father dying when she was young, she was educated by her mother in the principle of truth as pro∣fessed among us; in her young years she was sober and grave in her behaviour and deportment; and about the time she came forth in the ministry, she went through close trials and deep conflicts, as we have frequently heard her relate, in which the divine arm was her support, brought her through, and qualified her for religious ser∣vice.</P>
<P>In the year 1736, she was married to our worthy friend Owen Evans, and thereby be∣came a member of this meeting. Her pub∣lic appearances were not very frequent, but
<PB N="277" REF="020377_0284_0FAF07CD021084C8"/>
when she spoke, her testimony was fervent, sound and edifying, her conduct and con∣versation being agreeable to her religious profession. She was several times drawn forth in the love of the gospel, to visit friends in most of the provinces on this continent, also the Island of Tortola, which she undertook with the unity of her friends at home, and returned with clear and satis∣factory accounts of her labours amongst those whom she visited. She was a lover and promoter of peace and good order in the church and amongst her neighbours, and was frequently engaged in that weighty service of visiting friends families, to good satisfaction. In the year 1757, she met with a close exercise, in the loss of her hus∣band, who was removed from her by death, which she bore with becoming resignation. After which, she lived some years with her daughter, who was married and settled in Philadelphia; but returned back again with∣in the compass of this meeting, frequently saying,

labouring faithfully, as one that foresaw her time was short. Her last illness was lingering, which she bore with becoming resignation; a few days before her death, some friends had a sitting with her in her chamber, when notwithstanding she was weak in body, she was enabled to speak for a considerable time, in a lively and instructive manner, much to their satis∣faction.

As she advanced in years, she grew in religi∣on, and became very serviceable in divers stations in the church. About the year 1745 she first appear'd in the ministry, in the ex∣ercise whereof she was acceptable and edi∣fying,
<PB N="279" REF="020377_0286_0FAF07CE726AC8B8"/>
exhortimg all to the true love and fear of God, and a humble attention to the divine principle of truth in themselves; adorning her doctrine by a life and conver∣sation answerable thereto. The latter part of her time, when more disengaged from the cares of a family, she was much devoted to the service of truth, and occasionally vi∣sited many of the meetings of friends in our own and several of the neighbouring pro∣vinces.</P>
<P>She was a peaceable kind neighbour, a visitor and sympathizer with the sick and afflicted whether in body or mind; and ap∣pear'd eminently qualified for that weighty service of visiting families, in which she was often engaged, not only within the compass of our own particular meeting, but of di∣vers others, to general satisfaction.</P>
<P>Having lived in much love and unity with friends, she had to reflect thereon with great peace and satisfaction of mind in her last illness, during which she was sig∣nally favoured with the incomes of divine love and heavenly consolation; in the a∣boundings whereof, she was frequently drawn forth in thanksgivings and living high praises to the Lord.</P>

<P>HE was born in Rhode-Island, of honest parents, who died whilst he was young, from which time until he came to man's estate, we have no account of him, only that some of us have heard him say, he was much delighted with mirth and vanity. Soon after his arrival at manhood, he came into New-Jersey, where he married, and settled at Evesham; not long afterwards he was convinced, and effectually reached with the power of truth, through the living mi∣nistry of that eminent minister of Christ Jesus, Thomas Wilson; and by the operati∣on of divine grace in his heart, he gradually experienced a growth therein. Thus ad∣vancing in true obedience, he witnessed an overcoming of his own strong will (as some of us have heard him relate with awful gratitude to the divine hand) and in due time he became a father and elder in the church; being tenderly concerned for the promotion of the truth, which had in mea∣sure set him free from the body of sin and death, communicating suitable advice and counsel to such as were tender, and a sharp reprover of obstinate sinners; his advice being much enforced by his upright uni∣form conduct.</P>
<P>In conversation he was free and open, and easy of access: In meetings for worship and
<PB N="281" REF="020377_0288_0FAF07CFF79E6F10"/>
discipline (which he diligently attended whilst of ability) his deportment was aw∣ful, reverent and unaffectedly grave, wait∣ing for the arising of life, which qualified him to be of great service in the society. He was of a benevolent disposition, his heart and house being open to entertain strangers, especially travelling friends; nor was his benevolence confined to those of our own society; for, being blessed with afflu∣ence, many widows and fatherless received his hearty assistance. He was well beloved by most or all who were acquainted with him; his conversation and conduct truly demonstrated, that he had learn'd to do to others, as he would be done unto; which is truly worthy the imitation of all. Being desirous to retire from the cares of the world, he removed to Mount-Holly, where he re∣sided until he was taken with a paralytick disorder, which much impaired his natural faculties, after which he return'd to his former settlement at Evesham under the care of his son. Altho' his disorder render'd him incapable of much conversation, yet he gave evident signs of a lively sense of di∣vine goodness accompanying him to the last; and quietly departed this life, the 9<HI>th</HI> of the first month 1770, in the eighty-eighth year of his age, and was buried the 11<HI>th</HI> of the same month at Evesham.</P>

<HEAD>A Testimony from the Monthly-Meeting of Friends in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> concerning <HI>DANIEL STANTON.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEN John the Divine was in exile in the isle of Patmos,
<Q>He heard a voice from Heaven, saying, write,— blessed are the dead, who die in the Lord, from henceforth, yea saith the spirit, that they may rest from their labours, and their works do follow them;</Q>
which we believe now is the portion of our worthy friend, concerning whose faithful services we are engaged from the united motives of love and duty, to give this testimony; de∣siring, that all who read it, and more especi∣ally the youth, may be excited, by his ex∣ample, to seek an early acquaintance with the Lord, and to take up their daily cross in the prime of their days. Thus, they al∣so, may become shining lights and instru∣ments of good to others.</P>
<P>He was born in this city, in the year 1708, and his father dying before his birth, and his mother a few years after, he suffer∣ed great trials and hardships when very young: Being early concerned to seek the knowledge of God, he had a fervent desire to attend religious meetings, though sub∣jected to many difficulties and discourage∣ments, before that privilege was allowed him; yet, being earnest in his desires to ob∣tain divine favour, he was eminently sup∣ported
<PB N="283" REF="020377_0290_0FAF07D1731C2310"/>
under great conflicts and probations, and, continuing faithful to the degrees of light and grace communicated, a dispensati- of the gospel ministry was committed to him, sometime before the term of his ap∣prenticeship was expired; and abiding un∣der the sanctifying power of truth, he grew in his gift, and became a zealous faithful minister.</P>
<P>He was very exemplary in his industry and diligence, in labouring faithfully at his trade, to provide for his own support, and after he married, and had children, for their maintenance; and was often concerned to advise others to the same necessary care; yet he continued fervent in spirit for the promotion of truth and righteousness, so that he was soon engaged to leave home, and the nearest connections of nature, to publish the glad tidings of the gospel, and frequently visited most of the meetings of friends in this and the adjacent provinces, and several times as far as the eastern parts of New-England. Having thus honestly discharged his duty among us above twenty years, and feeling his mind constrained in the love of the gospel, to visit the few friends who remained in some of the West-India islands, and from thence the meetings of friends in general through Great-Britain and Ireland, he communicated his concern to a few of his most intimate friends, who having unity therewith, he was encouraged to lay it before our monthly-meeting. Before he
<PB N="284" REF="020377_0291_0FAF07D2363C71F8"/>
entered on this weighty service, he passed through a near trial and affliction in the death of his beloved wife; under which exercise he was graciously supported by the arm of divine strength, which had often been revealed for his help, in times of in∣ward conflicts and outward distresses.</P>
<P>His concern to travel in the service of truth continuing, and the meeting having full unity with him therein, he embarked in the fifth month 1748, accompanied by our dear friend, Samuel Nottingham, in a vessel bound for Barbados, and having vi∣sited the few meetings in that island, they went by way of Antigua to Tortola, where they continued sometime, having some dif∣ficulty to get a passage to Europe; and their voyage thither was attended with some sin∣gular hazards and dangers, which occasion∣ed their landing in Ireland; where our friend Daniel continued some months, visiting the meetings of friends in that kingdom; and after he apprehended himself clear, went over to England, and visited the meetings generally in that nation, and in Wales and Scotland, where his meek circumspect con∣duct and conversation, and lively edifying ministry, rendered his visit very acceptable, and his memory precious.</P>
<P>In his return home, and for sometime af∣ter, he was in a low afflicted state of mind; being apprehensive, that through diffidence, and the want of perfect resignation to the divine will, he had omitted fully perform∣ing
<PB N="285" REF="020377_0292_0FAF07D2EF009F90"/>
the service required of him, by not vi∣siting the few friends in Holland: Yet he was mercifully preserved, and after a time of deep exercise, raised again to sing of the mercies and loving-kindness of God on the banks of deliverance.</P>
<P>He several times, with other friends ap∣pointed to that service, visited the families of friends in this city, and between the years 1757 and 1760, being accompanied by our friend John Pemberton, he visited the families of friends generally within the limits of our meeting; which weighty ex∣ercising service, he was enabled to perform to our edification and satisfaction. After which, he was frequently engaged to excite friends to this useful and edifying practice.</P>
<P>In the twelfth month 1760, he set out on a visit to the meetings in the western parts of this province, and from thence in Mary∣land, Virginia, and North and South-Caro∣lina, and returned in the sixth month fol∣lowing; since which he frequently visited many of the meetings near home, and some as far as Long-Island, and other parts of the province of New-York. Within the last two years, he visited the families of friends of some of the meetings in West-Jersey, in the city of New-York, and part of Long-Island; and after his return from this service, with great peace and satisfaction, he expressed his appre∣hension that he was now clear of all places, and that his stay here was near over; having
<PB N="286" REF="020377_0293_0FAF07D59B84E818"/>
an evidence, that he had been faithfully con∣cerned from his youth to fear and serve God.</P>
<P>His chief labour and religious exercises were in this city, where he was a diligent attender of all our meetings, and often on committees appointed on the services of the church; in which he was solid and weighty in spirit, waiting for the springing up of life, being steadily concerned both in and out of meetings, to live near the divine foun∣tain: Thus he was very frequently qualifi∣ed, and enabled to stir up the pure mind, and to recount the gracious dealings of God to mankind, and as a faithful embassador to warn the negligent to flee from the wrath to come, and to excite the people to bring forth fruits answerable to the great mercies graciously bestowed on us; and was some∣times constrained to declare in a prophetic manner, a day of trial, in divers instances, very shortly before such a season came to pass.</P>
<P>He was of late deeply exercised in con∣sideration of the evils of the horse races, stage plays, drunkenness, and other gross enormities encouraged and increasing in this city; closely exhorting our youth against those pernicious and destructive devices of the enemy of mankind; and under the aw∣ful sense that God will judge and punish the wicked and evil doers, he was often fervent in public supplications, that the Lord would lengthen out the day of his merciful visitati∣on,
<PB N="287" REF="020377_0294_0FAF07D7A90C1A38"/>
and yet try the people longer; which seasons were solemn and humblingly affect∣ing; manifesting, that although he was very close and sharp in reproof against evil, yet most tenderly concerned, that the transgres∣sors of the righteous law of God might be prevailed with to repent, return, and live.</P>
<P>His love for the rising generation was ve∣ry great; which he manifested by his affec∣tionate notice of them, and especially of those who were religiously inclined, and his house was open to receive such, his conver∣sation with them being seasoned with grace, and his counsel instructive and helpful to those who had seeking desires after the knowledge of truth, often lovingly inviting them to come, taste, and see, that the Lord is good; greatly desiring, that all who pro∣fess the truth, might walk agreeable to its dictates and be led thereby, as our worthy predecessors were, into that meekness, hu∣mility, and godly simplicity and plainness, which rendered them conspicuous and shi∣ning examples, and that none might rest short of the enjoyment of the life or religi∣on, his zeal being great against such, who have the form of godliness, and by their actions manifest they have not the power thereof; and he often fervently advis'd and cautioned those who are eagerly pursuing the world, and by the surfeiting cares, and grasping after earthly treasures, frustrate the good purpose of the visitation of divine grace to them, and closely reminded those, who
<PB N="288" REF="020377_0295_0FAF07D896B55AC0"/>
in their small beginnings were low and hum∣ble, that now they were abundantly favour∣ed, they should not set their affections on things below, but remember the rock from whence they were hewn; and his concern was great that those who had the glad tidings of the gospel to publish, might be true ex∣amples to the flock, and adorn the doctrine they had to deliver by a circumspect life and conversation, and where any by not steadily keeping to that which would have preserved them, had involved themselves in difficulties, either by letting their minds out to the gains and profits of this world, or otherwise, his travail was great for such that they might be brought through, and every cloud and mist removed.</P>
<P>He was much employed in visiting the sick and afflicted, to whom he administered his spiritual advice and experience, and of∣ten engaged in humble prayer for their sup∣port; and in the distributing to the necessit∣ous according to his circumstances, he ma∣nifested his benevolent disposition.</P>
<P>As he had been many years under great exercise and suffering of spirit on account of the slavery of the poor Africans, and frequently bore testimony against that un∣righteous gain of oppression, he was of late somewhat relieved, as he found the eyes of the people become more open to see the in∣iquity of the practice; and he died in faith, that the light of the gospel will so general∣ly prevail, that the professors of christianity
<PB N="289" REF="020377_0296_0FAF07D90DA85680"/>
will find it their duty to restore to these peo∣ple their natural right to liberty, and to in∣struct them in the principles of the christian religion.</P>
<P>On the 5<HI>th</HI> day of the fifth month, he was violently seized with the bilious cholic, and continued in great pain several days; but afterwards being somewhat easier, he was at our morning and evening meetings on firstday, the 13<HI>th</HI> of the month, in which he was much favoured in his public mini∣stry, and expressed that he thought his time would not be long with us. After this day's labour, he was again confined, yet being a little recovered he was at our meeting on fifth∣day, the 24<HI>th</HI> of the month, which being small, he expressed his sorrow for it, and encouraged friends to diligence in the at∣tendance of week day meetings, the benefit of a faithful discharge of duty therein be∣ing great; the next day he was at our monthly-meeting, and to his own and our admiration was enabled to stay through both our sittings, though the last of them was longer than usual, and he afterwards ex∣pressed that he thought himself better in the meeting than when out; it was a season of divine favour, and some weighty matters being before the meeting, he with great openness spoke pertinently and clearly to them, encouraging friends to the supporting and maintaining our christian testimony, against all that is contrary to i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the last public meeting he was a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne
<PB N="290" REF="020377_0297_0FAF07D9B43B3740"/>
next morning early seized with a renewed attack of the same disorder, which increas∣ed on him several days, and was so fixed, that all the endeavours of several skilful physicians and tender nurses, were not ef∣fectual to remove it, tho' in some measure to mitigate the pain, that he suffered much, not being able to lie down in his bed several weeks, yet thro' all he was mercifully sup∣ported, in much resignation, and patience, rather inclining, if it was the Lord's will, to be released.</P>
<P>For two or three weeks before his sickness, he appeared very desirous of settling every thing he had to do respecting the affairs of this life, and desired a friend to review and transcribe the short memoirs he hath left of his travels and religious services, and to write his will, which he executed the day before he was first taken sick, and then appeared easy in his mind.</P>
<P>During the time of his sickness he often expressed his concern lest his friends should be too anxious for his recovery, saying, if he should live longer, and thro' any human frailty or infirmity occasion any reproach, it would be a cause of sorrow to them.</P>
<P>By the desire of his friends who attended him, he rode out several times, tho' not without much difficulty, and spent the two last days of his life at the houses of two of his intimate friends. As he drew near his end, the strength of his love to mankind in general, and his friends in particular, evi∣dently
<PB N="291" REF="020377_0298_0FAF07DA7B071968"/>
increased, much desiring the prospe∣rity of truth, and when a meeting time came had an earnest desire to be with friends, and particularly the day before his departure.</P>
<P>During his sickness, he frequently ex∣pressed himself in a very seasonable, instruc∣tive, and affecting manner; and the even∣ing of the firstday before he died, several friends coming in to see him, he spoke a co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>siderable time to them, having before bee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> desirous of such an opportunity of the company of his friends, to sit down and wait upon God, which was his gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> delight.</P>
<P>The last day of his life he sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt at the house of his friend Israel Pemberton, at Ger∣mantown, and was unusually free and cheer∣ful, even till ten o'clock at night, when he undressed himself, and went into bed, re∣marking on lying down, that he had not before been able to do so, for five weeks or upwards, and he soon after fell asleep, but in a short time was awakened by the return of pain and difficulty of breathing, which thro' his illness he had been much afflicted with, so that he was oblig'd to set up in bed, and thus continued, at intervals freely con∣versing with our said friend, who sat up with him, and he expressed his great thank∣fulness that his head was preserved free from pain and his understanding clear, and that though it had been a time of close trial and deep probation, he could say he felt the evidence of divine support still to attend him. After which, his pains increasing he
<PB N="292" REF="020377_0299_0FAF0682F8F085D8"/>
got up and dressed himself, and walking about the room sometime, sat down in an easy chair, in which he fell into a sweet sleep, and in about three hours departed without sigh or groan.</P>
<P>Thus died this righteous man, who hav∣ing fought the good fight and kept the faith, finished his course in full unity with us, and universally beloved by his fellow citizens, on the 28<HI>th</HI> day of the sixth month 1770, in the sixty-second year of his age and 43<HI>d</HI> of his ministry. His body was the next day attended by a large number of people of di∣vers religious denominations to our meeting-house, and afterwards interr'd in friends burial-ground in this city.</P>

<P>HE was born in Chester county Penn∣sylvania, in the year 1716, of believ∣ing parents, and being religiously inclined from his youth, he received a part in the mi∣nistry, whereto being faithful, he experi∣enced a growth therein. In the year 1766, he removed with his family, and settled in Warrington Township, York county, with∣in the limits of our meeting: And tho' his time among us was short, yet we have this testimony to bear concerning him; that his
<PB N="293" REF="020377_0300_0FAF0683C7B18B20"/>
labours of love, accompanied with an ex∣emplary conduct, were comfortable and instructing to us.</P>
<P>In his last illness (which was a consumpti∣on) he, at times in the beginning of it, complained to some of his intimate friends, of great poverty of spirit, and seemed deep∣ly engaged to wrestle for strength, to bear with patience the present dispensation: And in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me it pleased the father of mercies who hears the secret cries of his depending children, to cause the mists to be dispelled, so that, in an opportunity which some friends had with him some little time before his departure, he was much favoured, and drawn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orth to

saying,
<Q>He had loved the Lord from his youth, that he had a small gift in the ministry bestowed upon him, in which he had been concerned to be faith∣ful, and now he felt the comfort of it; feeling the ownings of the divine presence, whereby he was enabled to bear with pa∣tience his bodily affliction; having an as∣surance of immortal rest; and that tho' in the beginning of his illness, from the poverty of spirit that attended him, he was ready to conclude that the Lord had forsaken him, but now he answered him to the joy of his heart, and he had to
<PB N="294" REF="020377_0301_0FAF06848C5EE2A8"/>
magnify his goodness, seeing his wisdom therein, in weaning his affections more thoroughly from all lower enjoyments, and placing them on things above.</Q></P>
<P>He advised friends to humility, saying,
<Q>The time draws near, that my body must go down to the grave, wherein is no ex∣altation; and I have this testimony to bear for the Lord, that as I have been engaged to love him and walk humbly before him, desiring he might give me strength, not having any dependance on my own wis∣dom, I have found him to strengthen me, and now find him to be near me in this pinching time, and comfort me with the joys of his presence.</Q>
Many and com∣fortable were the expressions which flowed from him, tho' weak in body, and scarcely able to speak intelligibly, yet strong and lively in the inward man. In great sweet∣ness of spirit he departed this life, the 9<HI>th</HI> of the fifth month 1771, and on the 11<HI>th</HI> of the said month, his corps, accompanied by a large number of friends and others, was interr'd in friends burying-ground at Warrington, a solemn meeting being held, and divers living testimonies borne, to the efficacy of that divine power which gives victory over the world.</P>

<P>FROM a motive of love and esteem, to the memory of this our ancient wor∣thy friend, and that survivors may be en∣couraged by such pious examples, to em∣brace the truth and persevere in the way to salvation, we give forth this testimony.</P>
<P>She was the daughter of Henry and Eli∣zabeth Burr, by whom she was religiously educated, we believe to good effect; for in her very young years, she closed in with the love and mercy of God extended to her, and did not incline to vanity and lightness, but was a good example to other youths.</P>
<P>She married young, and with her hus∣band Jacob Lippincott, settled among us. Her exemplary conduct, as a wife and when a widow, both in the church, in her family, and her neighbourhood gained our great esteem; being given to hospitality and li∣beral to the poor.</P>
<P>She was an earnest traveller in spirit for the cause of truth on earth, solid and weigh∣ty in her deportment, affable and instructive in conversation, frequently imparting sea∣sonable admonition and counsel to her chil∣dren and others, and tho' endowed with superior natural understanding, was not exalted therewith.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="020377_0303_0FAF0686BA6E0DB8"/>In the decline of life, she underwent much bodily infirmity, yet diligently attended meetings when of ability, where she was a humble waiter for the arising of the pure truth, travelling in the deeps for the exalta∣tion thereof; well qualified for services in the church, a true mourner in Zion, being grieved for the corruptions, vain fashions, and customs of the times, and in observing the gaiety and lightness apparent in some, when they came to places for worship. It fell to her lot in the course of her time, to meet with a large share of exercises and tri∣als, which she bore with great resignation; and was a true sympathizer with those un∣der affliction in body or mind whom she often visited. Sometime before her last sick∣ness, she signified her apprehension, that her day's work was near over; and departed this life, the 9<HI>th</HI> of the first month 1771, and on the 12<HI>th</HI> was interr'd in friends bury∣ing-ground at Pilesgrove; in the seventy-third year of her age, having been an elder many years.</P>

<PB N="297" REF="020377_0304_0FAF0686DBC28970"/>
Thomas Thornborough, of the same place, being on a religious visit to friends of this nation, departed this life, at the house of a friend near New-Castle upon Tyne. The deep regard we bear to his memory and eminent services, engageth us to transmit the following testimony concerning him.</P>
<P>They arrived in London about a week af∣ter the yearly-meeting 1771, and attending several meetings in that city, proceeded northward, visiting friends in divers coun∣ties in England, and also in Scotland. The ensuing winter was spent in visiting York∣shire, Lancashire and Ireland, returning to London in time to attend the yearly-meet∣ing there in 1772; then attending the year∣ly-meetings in Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk, and proceeding through Lincolnshire to Hull, they took shipping for Holland, and after visiting the few friends there, they embarked for Scarborough, but by contrary winds landed at Shields, the 25<HI>th</HI> of the eighth month, and after being at their meet∣ing on the 26<HI>th</HI> came that afternoon to the house of a friend near New-Castle upon Tyne.</P>
<P>From accounts received, and our own knowledge of his conduct and ministry, we have good cause to believe, that in all his travels in Europe, he behaved as a faithful minister of Christ, exemplary and uniform in conduct, of a weighty deportment and retired spirit, his conversation was grave and instructive, seasoned with love and
<PB N="298" REF="020377_0305_0FAF068775BA5D30"/>
sweetness, which rendered his company both profitable and desirable, his ministry was living and powerful, deep and search∣ing, an excellent example in patiently wait∣ing for the clear manifestation of the divine will, and careful to move accordingly, so that his appearances in meetings were most∣ly accompanied with great solemnity, in which he skilfully divided the word, being to the unfaithful as a two edged sword, but to the honest hearted travellers in Zion, and to such as were seeking the way to God's kingdom, his doctrine was truly refreshing. He was a man of sound judgment, quick of apprehension, and deep in religious ex∣perience; and altho' he was only in the thirty-ninth year of his age, yet such was his experience and stability, that he stood as an elder and a father in the church, worthy of double honour.</P>
<P>He attended the meeting at New-Castle, on the 27<HI>th</HI> of the eighth month 1772, in which he delivered a short and living testimony in the love of the gospel to his friends of that place; that afternoon he was cheerful, and expressed his satisfaction in being there, and upon being asked what place they intended for next, he replied, he saw no further at present than New-Castle. Next day he was taken ill, which was not apprehended to be the small pox 'till the fourth day of his ill∣ness; when the eruption appeared, he said to his companion,
<Q>This sickness is nigh unto death if not quite;</Q>
his companion
<PB N="299" REF="020377_0306_0FAF068847A43510"/>
signified his hope that it might not be so, he replied,
<Q>My coming hither seems to be providential, and when I wait I am in∣closed and see no further.</Q>
At another time he made the same remark to a friend, say∣ing,
<Q>It will be a sore trial to my compani∣on if I am now removed.</Q>
He also men∣tioned in an affectionate manner his dear wife and children to a friend who attended him, and requested some counsel and advice (which he then communicated) might be transmitted to them, if it should please the Lord to remove him, which was according∣ly done.</P>
<P>On the third day of his illness, two friends from the country came to visit him, to whom he thus expressed himself, viz.
<Q>I have longed to see you and be with you, but was put by,</Q>
one of them said, I hope we shall have thee with us yet; he answered, 'That must be left;' the friend said, that whatever affliction we are tried with, we may yet see cause of thankfulness; he repli∣ed,
<Q>Great cause indeed, I never saw it clearer, O the wisdom! the wisdom and goodness, the mercy and kindness has ap∣peared to me wonderful, and the further and deeper we go, the more we wonder; I have admired since I was cast upon this bed, that all the world does not seek after the truth, it so far transcends all other things.</Q>
Two friends from Northumber∣land coming to visit him, he said,
<Q>The Lord knows how I have loved you from
<PB N="300" REF="020377_0307_0FAF068AE71FA3E8"/>
our first acquaintance, and longed for your growth and establishment in the blessed truth; and now I feel the same renewed afresh;</Q>
and said,
<Q>He much desired they might fill up the places Providence intend∣ed, and lay up treasure in Heaven,</Q>
adding,
<Q>What would a thousand worlds avail me now?</Q></P>
<P>The disorder was very heavy upon him, having a load of eruption, under which he shewed great fortitude and patience even to the admiration of the physician and surgeon who attended him; his mind being merci∣fully preserved calm, and resigned to his master's will, whose presence he found to be near him in the needful time, saying,
<Q>It is enough, my master is here;</Q>
and again,
<Q>He that laid the foundation of the moun∣tans knows this, if it pleases him he can remove it;</Q>
at another time he said with great composure,
<Q>The Lord knows best, I am in his hands, let him do what he pleases.</Q></P>
<P>Perceiving a friend to be diligent and at∣tentive to do what she could for him, he said,
<Q>The Lord refresh thy spirit, for thou hast often refreshed this body, and whether I live or die, thou wilt get thy reward.</Q></P>
<P>After the second fever came on, finding himself worse, he said,
<Q>My life hangs upon a thread.</Q>
The doctor being sent for, he said,
<Q>They are all physicians of no value without the great Physician.</Q>
A friend said, I know thy dependence is on him, he an∣swered,
<PB N="301" REF="020377_0308_0FAF068BF9C4DD38"/>
'Entirely.' Understanding that two friends who had sat much by him, did not intend to leave him that night, he very sweetly said,
<Q>And will you watch with me one night more?</Q></P>
<P>On being asked how he did, he said,
<Q>I am here pent up and confined in a narrow compass, this is a trying time, but my mind is above it all;</Q>
which was evident to those about him, who were sensible of praises and sweet melody in his heart when few words were expressed.</P>
<P>A little before he died, he said trium∣phantly, 'Friends, truth is over all;' so in great peace departed this life, the 9<HI>th</HI> day of the ninth month 1772, and was interr'd in friends burying-ground in New-Castle upon Tyne, the 11<HI>th</HI> of the same month, accompanied by many friends; upon which occasion a solemn meeting was held, and divers testimonies borne to the truth, in the service of which he lived and died, an ex∣ample to many brethren.

<HEAD>A Testimony from <HI>Burlington</HI> Monthly-Meeting in <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> concerning <HI>JOHN WOOL∣MAN.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HE was born in Northampton, in the county of Burlington, and province of West-New-Jersey, in the eighth month 1720,
<PB N="302" REF="020377_0309_0FAF068CE71FAFA0"/>
of religious parents, who instructed him very early in the principles of the christian religi∣on, as professed by the people called Quakers, which he esteemed a blessing to him, even in his young years, tending to preserve him from the infection of wicked children; but through the workings of the enemy, and le∣vity incident to youth, he frequently deviated from those parental precepts, by which he laid a renewed foundation for repentance, that was finally succeeded by a godly sorrow not to be repented of, and so became ac∣quainted with that sanctifying power which qualifies for true gospel ministry, into which he was called about the twenty-second year of his age, and by a faithful use of the ta∣lents committed to him, he experienced an increase, until he arrived at the state of a fa∣ther, capable of dividing the word aright to the different states he ministered unto; dis∣pensing. milk to babes, and meat to those of riper years. Thus he found the efficacy of that power to arise, which in his own ex∣pressions,
<Q>Prepares the creature to stand like a trumpet through which the Lord speaks to his people.</Q>
He was a loving husband, a tender father, and very humane to every part of the creation under his care.</P>
<P>His concern for the poor and those in af∣fliction was evident by his visits to them; whom he frequently relieved by his assistance and charity. He was for many years deeply exercised on account of the poor enslaved A∣fricans, whose cause, as he sometimes men∣tioned,
<PB N="303" REF="020377_0310_0FAF068D929389F8"/>
lay almost continually upon him, and to obtain liberty to those captives, he la∣boured both in public and private; and was favoured to see his endeavours crowned with considerable success. He was particularly desirous that friends should not be instru∣mental to lay burthens on this oppressed peo∣ple, but remember the days of suffering from which they had been providentially delivered, that if times of trouble should return, no in∣justice dealt to those in slavery might rise in judgment against us, but, being clear, we might on such occasions address the Almigh∣ty with a degree of confidence, for his inter∣position and relief, being particularly careful as to himself, not to countenance slavery even by the use of those conveniencies of life which were furnished by their labour.</P>
<P>He was desirous to have his own, and the minds of others, redeemed from the pleasures, and immoderate profits of this world, and to fix them on those joys which fade not away; his principal care being after a life of purity, endeavouring to avoid not only the grosser pollutions, but those also which, appearing in a more refined dress, are not sufficiently guarded against by some well disposed peo∣ple. In the latter part of his life he was re∣markable for the plainness and simplicity of his dress, and as much as possible, avoided the use of plate, costly furniture and feasting; thereby endeavouring to become an example of temperance and self-denial, which, he be∣lieved himself called unto; and was favour∣ed
<PB N="304" REF="020377_0311_0FAF068E36271150"/>
with peace therein, altho' it carried the appearance of great austerity in the view of some. He was very moderate in his charges in the way of business, and in his desires af∣ter gain; and tho' a man of industry, avoid∣ed, and strove much to lead others out of ex∣treme labour, and anxiousness after perisha∣ble things; being desirous that the strength of our bodies might not be spent in procuring things unprofitable, and that we might use moderation and kindness to the brute ani∣mals under our care, to prize the use of them as a great favour, and by no means abuse them; that the gifts of Providence should be thankfully received and applied to the uses they were designed.</P>
<P>He several times opened a school at Mount-Holly, for the instruction of poor friends children and others, being concerned for their help and improvement therein: His love and care for the rising youth among us was truly great, recommending to parents and those who have the charge of them, to chuse conscientious and pious tutors, saying,
<Q>It is a lovely sight to behold innocent chil∣dren,</Q>
and that
<Q>To labour for their help against that which would marr the beauty of their minds, is a debt we owe them.</Q></P>
<P>His ministry was sound, very deep and penetrating, sometimes pointing out the dan∣gerous situation which indulgence and cus∣tom leads into; frequently exhorting others, especially the youth, not to be discouraged at the difficulties which occur, but press af∣ter
<PB N="305" REF="020377_0312_0FAF068F0AB925D0"/>
purity. He often expressed an earnest en∣gagement that pure wisdom should be at∣tended to, which would lead into lowliness of mind and resignation to the divine will, in which state small possessions here would be sufficient.</P>
<P>In transacting the affairs of discipline, his judgment was sound and clear, and he was very useful in treating with those who had done amiss; he visited such in a private way in that plainness which truth dictates, shewing great tenderness and christian for∣bearance. He was a constant attender of our yearly-meeting, in which he was a good ex∣ample, and particularly useful; assisting in the business thereof with great weight and at∣tention. He several times visited most of the meetings of friends in this and the neigh∣bouring provinces, with the concurrence of the monthly-meeting to which he belonged, and we have reason to believe had good ser∣vice therein, generally or always expressing at his return how it had fared with him, and the evidence of peace in his mind for thus performing his duty. He was often concern∣ed with other friends in the important ser∣vice of visiting families, which he was ena∣bled to go through to satisfaction.</P>
<P>In the minutes of the meeting of ministers and elders for this quarter, at the foot of a list of the members of that meeting, made about five years before his death, we find in his hand-writing the following observation and reflections.</P>

<P>In the twelfth month 1771, he acquainted this meeting that he found his mind drawn towards a religious visit to friends in some parts of England, particularly in Yorkshire. In the first month 1772, he obtained our cer∣tificate, which was approved and endorsed by our quarterly-meeting, and by the half year's meeting of ministers and elders at Philadelphia. He embarked on his voyage in the fifth and arrived in London in the sixth month following, at the time of their annual meeting in that city. During his short visit to friends in that kingdom, we are informed that his services were accepta∣ble and edifying. In his last illness he ut∣tered many lively and comfortable expressi∣ons, being
<Q>Perfectly resigned, having no will either to live or die,</Q>
as appears by the testimony of friends at York in Great-Bri∣tain, in the suburbs whereof at the house

<HEAD>A Testimony from the Quarterly-Meeting at <HI>York</HI> in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> concerning <HI>JOHN WOOLMAN.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS our valuable friend having been under a religious engagement for some time, to visit friends in this nation, and more especially us in the northern parts, undertook the same in full concurrence and near sympathy with his friends and bre∣thren at home, as appeared by certificates from the monthly and quarterly-meetings to which he belonged, and from the spring-meeting of ministers and elders, held at Philadelphia, for Pennsylvania and New-Jersey.</P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="020377_0315_0FAF06912F6D76D8"/>He arrived in the city of London the be∣ginning of the last yearly-meeting, and after attending that meeting travelled northward, visiting the quarterly-meetings of Hertford∣shire, Buckinghamshire, Northamptonshire, Oxfordshire and Worcestershire, and divers particular meetings in his way.</P>
<P>He visited many meetings on the west-side of this county, also some in Lancashire and Westmoreland, from whence he came to our quarterly-meeting in the last ninth month, and though much out of health, yet was en∣abled to attend all the sittings of that meet∣ing except the last.</P>
<P>His disorder then, which proved the small-pox, increased speedily upon him, and was very afflicting; under which he was support∣ed in much meekness, patience, and christi∣an fortitude; to those who attended him in his illness, his mind appeared to be centered in divine love; under the precious influence whereof, we believe he finished his course, and entered into the mansions of everlasting rest.</P>
<P>In the early part of his illness he requested a friend to write and he broke forth thus.</P>
<P><Q>O Lord my God! the amazing horrors of darkness were gathered around me and covered me all over, and I saw no way to go forth; I felt the misery of my fellow creatures separated from the divine har∣mony and it was heavier than I could bear, and I was crushed down under it; I lifted up my hand, and stretched out my
<PB N="309" REF="020377_0316_0FAF0694CE046CB8"/>
arm, but there was none to help me; I looked round about and was amazed: In the depths of misery, O Lord! I remem∣bred that thou art omnipotent, that I had called thee father, and I felt that I loved thee, and I was made quiet in thy will, and I waited for deliverance from thee; thou hadst pity upon me, when no man could help me; I saw that meekness under suffering was shewed to us in the most af∣fecting example of thy son, and thou wast teaching me to follow him, and I said, thy will O father, be done.</Q></P>
<P>Many more of his weighty expressions might have been inserted here, but it was deemed unnecessary, they being already published in print.</P>
<P>He was a man endued with a large natu∣ral capacity, and being obedient to the ma∣nifestations of divine grace, having in pati∣ence and humility endured many deep bap∣tisms, he became thereby sanctified and fitted for the Lord's work, and was truly service∣able in his church; dwelling in awful fear and watchfulness, he was careful in his pub∣lic appearances to feel the putting forth of the divine hand, so that the spring of the gospel ministry often flowed through him with great sweetness and purity, as a refresh∣ing stream to the weary travellers towards the city of God: Skilful in dividing the word, he was furnished by him in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and know∣ledge, to communicate freely to the several
<PB N="310" REF="020377_0317_0FAF0695D7A2A0F0"/>
states of the people where his lot was cast. His conduct at other times was seasoned with the like watchful circumspection and attention to the guidance of divine wisdom, which rendered his whole conversation uni∣formly edifying.</P>
<P>He was fully persuaded that as the life of Christ comes to reign in the earth, all abuse and unnecessary oppression, both of the hu∣man and brute creation will come to an end; but under the sense of a deep revolt, and an overflowing stream of unrighteousness, his life has been often a life of mourning.</P>
<P>He was deeply concerned on account of that inhuman and iniquitous practice of making slaves of the people of Africa, or holding them in that state; and on that ac∣count we understand he hath not only wrote some books, but travelled much on the con∣tinent of America, in order to make the Ne∣gro masters (especially those in profession with us) sensible of the evil of such a prac∣tice; and though in this journey to England, he was far removed from the outward sight of their sufferings, yet his deep exercise of mind remained, as appears by a short trea∣tise he wrote in this journey, and his fre∣quent concern to open the miserable state of this deeply injured people: His testimony in the last meeting he attended was on this sub∣ject, wherein he remarked, that as we as a society, when under outward sufferings, had often found it our concern to lay them before those in authority, and thereby in
<PB N="311" REF="020377_0318_0FAF0696A9065990"/>
the Lord's time, had obtained relief, so he recommended this oppressed part of the cre∣ation to our notice, that we may as way may open, represent their sufferings in an individual, if not a society, capacity to those in authority.</P>
<P>Deeply sensible that the desire to gratify people's inclinations in luxury and superflui∣ties, is the principal ground of oppression, and the occasion of many unnecessary wants, he believed it to be his duty to be a pattern of great self-denial, with respect to the things of this life, and earnestly to labour with friends in the meekness of wisdom, to im∣press on their minds the great importance of our testimony in these things, recommending to the guidance of the blessed truth in this and all other concerns, and cautioning such as are experienced therein, against contenting themselves with acting up to the standard of others, but to be careful to make the stand∣ard of truth manifested to them, the measure of their obedience; for said he,
<Q>That pu∣rity of life which proceeds from faithful∣ness in following the spirit of truth, that state where our minds are devoted to serve God, and all our wants are bounded by his wisdom; this habitation has often, been opened before me as a place of re∣tirement for the children of the light, where they may stand separated from that which disordereth and confuseth the affairs of society, and where we may have a testi∣mony of our innocence in the hearts of those who behold us.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="312" REF="020377_0319_0FAF069733F9DCC8"/>We conclude with fervent desires, that we as a people may thus, by our example, promote the Lord's work in the earth; and our hearts being prepared, may unite in prayer to the great Lord of the harvest, that as in his infinite wisdom he hath greatly stripped the church, by removing of late divers faithful ministers and elders, he may be pleased to send forth many more faithful labourers into his harvest.</P>

<HEAD>The following Minutes of some of his Expressions in the time of his sickness, were preserved by our friend <HI>Thomas Priestman</HI> and others who attended him, <HI>viz.</HI></HEAD>
<P>FOURTH-DAY morning, 30<HI>th</HI> of the ninth month 1772, being asked how he felt himself, he meekly answered, I don't know that I have slept this night, I feel the disorder making its progress, but my mind is mercifully preserved in stillness and peace: Sometime after he said he was sensible the pains of death must be hard to bear, but if he escaped them now, he must sometime pass thro' them, and he did not know that he could be better prepared, but had no will in it. He said he had settled his outward af∣fairs to his mind, had taken leave of his wife and family as never to return, leaving them to the divine protection; adding, and tho' I feel them near to me at this time, yet I free∣ly give them up, having a hope that they
<PB N="313" REF="020377_0320_0FAF0697F7353978"/>
will be provided for. And a little after said, This trial is made easier than I could have thought, my will being wholly taken away; for if I was anxious for the event it would have been harder, but I am not, and my mind enjoys a perfect calm.</P>
<P>In the night a young woman having giv∣en him something to drink, he said, My child thou seems very kind to me a poor creature, the Lord will reward thee for it. Awhile af∣ter he cried out with great earnestness of spi∣rit, Oh my father! my father! and soon af∣ter he said, Oh my father! my father! how comfortable art thou to my soul in this try∣ing season. Being asked if he could take a little nourishment; after some pause he re∣plied, my child I cannot tell what to say to it; I seem nearly arrived where my soul shall have rest from all its troubles. After giving in something to be inserted in his journal, he said, I believe the Lord will now excuse me from exercises of this kind; and I see no work but one which is to be the last wrought by me in this world, the messenger will come that will release me from all these troubles; but it must be in the Lord's time, which I am waiting for. He said he had laboured to do whatever was required, according to the ability received, in the remembrance of which he had peace; and tho' the disorder was strong at times, and would like a whirl∣wind come over his mind; yet it had hither∣to been kept steady and center'd in everlast∣ing love; adding, and if that be mercifully
<PB N="314" REF="020377_0321_0FAF0698E432A5B8"/>
continued, I ask nor desire no more. An∣other time he said, he had long had a view of visiting this nation, and sometime before he came had a dream, in which he saw himself in the northern parts of it, and that the spring of the gospel was opened in him much as in the beginning of friends, such as George Fox and William Dewsbury, and he saw the different states of the people, as clear as he had everseen flowers in a garden; but in his going along he was suddenly stopt, tho' he could not see for what end; but looking towards home, fell into a flood of tears, which waked him.</P>
<P>At another time he said, my draught seem∣ed strongest towards the north, and I men∣tioned in my own monthly-meeting, that attending the quarterly-meeting at York, and being there looked like home to me.</P>
<P>Fifth-day night, having repeatedly con∣sented to take medicine with a view to settle his stomach, but without effect; the friend then waiting on him, said thro' distress, what shall I do now? He answered with great composure, Rejoice evermore, and in every thing give thanks; but added a little after, this is sometimes hard to come at.</P>
<P>Sixth-day morning he broke forth early in supplication on this wise, O Lord it was thy power that enabled me to forsake sin in my youth, and I have felt thy bruises for dis∣obedience; but as I bowed under them thou healed me, continuing a father and a friend; I feel thy power now, and I beg that in the
<PB N="315" REF="020377_0322_0FAF06999C63DA50"/>
approaching trying moment thou wilt keep my heart stedfast unto thee. Upon his giv∣ing directions to a friend concerning some little things, she said I will take care, but hope thou wilt live to order them thyself; he reply'd, my hope is in Christ, and tho' I may seem a little better, a change in the dis∣order may soon happen, and my little strength be dissolved, and if it so happens, I shall be gathered to my everlasting rest. On her say∣ing she did not doubt that, but could not help mourning to see so many faithful ser∣vants removed at so low a time; he said all good cometh from the Lord, whose power is the same, and can work as he sees best. The same day he had given directions about wrapping his corpse; perceiving a friend to weep, he said I would rather thou wouldst guard against weeping for me, my sister, I sorrow not, tho' I have had some painful con∣flicts, but now they seem over and matters well settled, and I look at the face of my dear redeemer, for sweet is his voice and his countenance is comely.</P>
<P>First-day, 4<HI>th</HI> of the tenth month, being very weak and in general difficult to be un∣derstood, he uttered a few words in comme∣moration of the Lord's goodness; and add∣ed, how tenderly have I been waited on in this time of affliction, in which I may say in Job's words, Tedious days and wearisome nights are appointed unto me, and how ma∣ny are spending their time and money in vanity and superfluities, while thousands
<PB N="316" REF="020377_0323_0FAF069A3271DD38"/>
and tens of thousands want the necessaries of life, who might be relieved by them, and their distresses at such a time as this, in some degree softened by the administring suitable things.</P>
<P>Second-day morning the apothecary who appeared very anxious to assist him, being present, he queried about the probability of such a load of matter being thrown off his weak body, and the apothecary making some remarks implying he thought it might; he spoke with an audible voice on this wise, My dependance is on the Lord Jesus, who I trust will forgive my sins, which is all I hope for, and if it be his will to raise up this body again, I am content; and if to die, I am re∣signed; and if thou canst not be easy with∣out trying to assist nature, I submit. After which his throat was so much affected, that it was very difficult for him to speak so as to be understood, and frequently wrote when he wanted any thing. About the second hour on fourth-day morning he asked for pen and ink, and at several times with much difficulty wrote thus, I believe my being here is in the wisdom of Christ, I know not as to life or death.</P>
<P>About a quarter before six the same morn∣ing he seemed to fall into an easy sleep, which continued about half an hour, when seeming to awake, he breathed a few times with more difficulty, and expired without sigh, groan, or struggle.</P>

<P>OUR worthy and much esteemed friend John Vail, was born at West-Chester, in the province of New-York, and removed from thence while young to Woodbridge, where he settled and married. He was when a youth, reached by the power of truth,

and submitting to the cross, he became so∣ber and religious; and continuing faithful and obedient to what he believed to be his duty, the Lord in infinite mercy, was pleased to bestow on him, a gift in the gos∣pel ministry, and he proving faithful with the one talent, witnessed an increase and growth in the truth, and was enlarged in his public testimony, whereby the church was edified, and the faithful comforted. Having a regard to the putting forth of the divine hand, he waited in meetings for pro∣per qualifications to minister in the ability that God gives, whereby he was often ena∣bled, not only to reprove the unrighteous∣ness of men, but to speak comfortably to those who mourned for the pride and abo∣minations of the times. He often mention∣ed the plainness and simplicity which our forefathers appeared in, and was sorrow∣fully affected for many of the present gene∣ration, in that they slighted their good ex∣amples, and indulged themselves in many things which those worthy men bore a faith∣ful testimony against. He was a diligent attender of meetings, and very exemplary in being early there, even to old age, when of ability of body; often exciting friends to that duty, not as formalists, but patient∣ly to wait for qualification to perform ac∣ceptable worship to the Almighty. His out∣ward circumstances being low, he was ve∣ry industrious, labouring with his hands for the support of himself and family, to

<P>He was exemplary himself, and careful to bring up his family in the practice of at∣tending meetings on the first and other days of the week; was zealous in promoting and faithful in performing that good work of vi∣siting friends families: His ministry was sound and edifying, being in the demonstra∣tion of the spirit and power; and he may be said to be of the number of them that through saith have obtained a good report.</P>
<P>The last year of his life, he was prevented from travelling far abroad, by reason of a lingering and painful disorder, but when a∣ble to attend his own meeting, he frequent∣ly appeared in the ministry, tho' under much bodily infirmity. And altho' he was

as a shock of corn fully ripe, gathered in its season, yet we are sensible of the loss the church has sustained by his removal; but we trust it is his everlasting gain, and that he now enjoys the fruits of his labours. His last expressions were,
<Q>Lord Jesus receive my soul.</Q></P>
<P>He departed this life, the 16<HI>th</HI> of the fourth month 1775, and was buried in friends burying-ground at Goshen, on the 19<HI>th</HI> of the same, aged eighty-one years, and a minister about 41 years.</P>

<HEAD>A Testimony from <HI>Nottingham</HI> Monthly-Meet∣ing in <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> concerning <HI>JOHN CHURCHMAN.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HE was born at Nottingham in Chester county, Pennsylvania, the 4<HI>th</HI> of the sixth month 1705, of religious parents, John and Hannah Churchman; and by his own account, was remarkably reached and made sensible of the inward appearance of grace and truth when very young; but through inattention thereto, suffered loss. About the twentieth year of his age, thro' the great loving kindness of a merciful God, the divine visitation was again renewed wherewith he closing in, became subject to the Lord's hand, who was about to prepare him as a chosen instrument for service. In his twen∣ty-fifth year he married, and soon after was
<PB N="324" REF="020377_0331_0FAF06A2AAB81C88"/>
recommended to the station of an elder, wherein we find, he acted with great cauti∣on, humility and fear, and being qualified for the service of visiting families, was em∣ployed therein.</P>
<P>His first appearance in public ministry, was in the year 1733, and by humble obe∣dience to the giver, he improved in the gift, and became an able minister of the gospel; in which service he travelled much, having visited the meetings of friends in this and several of the adjacent provinces, mostly se∣veral times; and in the summer 1742, he perform'd a religious visit to friends in New-England, and the year following to New-York and parts adjacent, which he repeated in 1774. In the year 1750 a concern ripen∣ed, which he expressed had for some years before, at times, rested with weight on his mind, to cross the seas in the service of the gospel, wherewith he had the free concur∣rence of his brethren at home (being always very careful in that respect;) and spent up∣wards of four years on a general visit to the meetings of friends in England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland and Holland, and also to the particular families of friends within the compass of divers meetings in different parts of Europe; and by several certificates pro∣duced to our meeting after his return, the unity and satisfaction of friends in those Eu∣ropean countries with his exemplary con∣duct and religious labours were fully ex∣pressed.</P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="020377_0332_0FAF06A33176B458"/>Although he was of a weakly constituti∣on, and often infirm, especially in the latter part of his life, yet he appeared to be much devoted to the service of truth and the good of mankind, and gave up his time for that purpose, when he apprehended it was requir∣ed of him, being favoured with a sufficiency of outward things, and we believe he stood loose from the world and its connections, not seeking, but refraining opportunities he might have had to get outward riches; he visited neighbouring yearly, quarterly, and other meetings of friends at times to his last year, and was truly useful in the discipline of the church, being eminently qualified for that service, and was a good example in a diligent care to attend all the meetings both for worship and discipline to which he be∣longed, cautious of being forward in his public appearances, and for the most part exampled us to silence in our meetings at home, especially in the latter part of his time; yet when he did appear in testimony, we think it may be truly said, his doctrine dropt as the dew, being lively and edifying to the honest hearted, tho' close and searching to the careless professors, as well as to the pro∣fane and hypocritical. The elders who have ruled well are to be accounted honorable, so the remembrance of the fatherly, diligent, humble, upright, honest, and self-denying example of this our deceased friend, as also his various services in our meetings and neighbourhood remain fresh, and of a plea∣sant savour to many minds.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="020377_0333_0FAF06A3F3917638"/>In his last illness, which held him up∣wards of three weeks, he appeared mostly sensible, and manifested much patience and resignation, uttering many lively expressions to those attending him, and to divers friends who came to see him; some of which being taken down in writing, are hereunto sub∣joined, viz.</P>

<HEAD>Some Account of the last illness of our friend <HI>John Churchman,</HI> and of divers of his weighty expressions, near the close of life.</HEAD>
<P>ON the 11<HI>th</HI> of the sixth month 1775, he return'd home, after performing his last journey, on a visit to most of the meetings on the Eastern-Shore of Maryland, and attending the yearly-meeting at Third-Haven in Talbot county. On the 14<HI>th</HI> of the same month, he went to the weekday meeting at London-Grove, to meet with a committee of our quarterly-meeting on par∣ticular business, and returned to our meet∣ing at Nottingham the next day, on the first day of the week following was there also, in the same week he attended our preparative and monthly-meetings, but a fever daily in∣creasing upon him, he was afterwards chief∣ly confined at home.</P>
<P>On the 4<HI>th</HI> of the seventh month he expressed himself thus,
<Q>I am glad that I am at home, I have ever found it best when my service abroad was over, to get home as quick as
<PB N="327" REF="020377_0334_0FAF06A4B1C881C0"/>
might be, and though I have felt great in∣ward poverty and weakness since my last journey, so that I can neither see my be∣ginning nor ending, but seem as if all were hidden, yet I hope if Providence shall see meet to remove me at this time, some light will appear again, and that it will be otherwise before I go.</Q></P>
<P>At another time he spake to this purpose,
<Q>I have found myself much stripped as to a sense of good, and tried with poverty ma∣ny days. I suppose I have been accounted by some, as one of the better sort of peo∣ple, but have seen great occasion to beware of a disposition that would seek to feed up∣on the praise or commendations of others; a carnal selfish spirit is very apt to present, and creep in here if possible, and I have seen it hurt many who have had right be∣ginnings, it always introduceth dimness, and oppression, to the pure, precious, in∣nocent life of truth, which only groweth up into dominion, through deep abase∣ment of soul, and the entire death of self.</Q></P>
<P>At several other times he signified to this effect,
<Q>My present baptism of affliction hath tended to the further refinement of my nature, and to the bringing me more perfectly into the image of my master.</Q></P>
<P>He frequently expressed his full submissi∣on to the divine will either respecting life or death, several times saying,
<Q>I now expe∣rience my life and my will to be slain, and I have no will left.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="020377_0335_0FAF06A7440FD350"/>In the two last weeks of his time it ap∣peared that his desire and hope, mentioned in the forepart of his illness, for light again to appear, was fully answered by the fresh in∣fluence thereof, so that altho' his pain was often great, he would many times in a day break forth into a kind of melody with his voice, without uttering words, which as he sometimes intimated, was an involuntary as∣piration of his soul in praise to the Lord, who had again been pleased to shine forth in brightness after many days of poverty and deep baptism, which tho' painful, had prov∣ed beneficial to him, being a means of fur∣ther purifying from the dregs of nature, say∣ing he was at times afraid to discover that melody in the hearing of some that visited him, lest they could not comprehend its meaning, and might therefore misconstrue it.</P>
<P>On second day morning the 17<HI>th</HI> of the seventh month, being asked by a friend how he was, he replied,
<Q>I am here in the body yet, and when I go out of it I hope there is nothing but peace,</Q>
and soon after fur∣ther said,
<Q>I have seen that all the bustles, and noises that are now in the world will end in confusion, and our young men that know not an establishment in the truth and the Lord's fear for a ballast, will be caught in a trying moment.</Q>
At another time he said,
<Q>I feel nothing but peace, hav∣ing endeavoured honestly to discharge my∣self
<PB N="329" REF="020377_0336_0FAF06A8354807A8"/>
in public, and privately to individu∣als as I apprehended was required, and if it be the Lord's will that I should go now, I shall be released from a great deal of trouble and exercise, which I believe friends who are left behind will have to pass through.</Q></P>
<P>On the 20<HI>th</HI> of the same month he thus expressed himself,
<Q>I love friends who abide in the truth as much as ever I did, and I feel earnest breathings to the Lord, that there may be such raised up in the church who may go forth in humility, sweetness, and life, clear of all superfluity in expressi∣ons and otherwise, standing for the testi∣mony, that they may be useful to the church in these difficult times.</Q></P>
<P>About three days before his death, several friends being in his room, he spake as follows,
<Q>Friends in the beginning, if they had health and liberty, were not easily divert∣ed from paying their tribute of worship to the Almighty on week days as well as first-days, but after awhile when outward sufferings ceased, life and zeal decaying, ease and the spirit of the world took place with many, and thus it became customa∣ry for one or two out of a family to attend meetings, and to leave their children much at home; parents also if worldly concerns were in the way could neglect their week day meetings sometimes, yet be willing to hold the name, and plead excuse because of a busy time, or the like, but I believe
<PB N="330" REF="020377_0337_0FAF06A98D1FBDC0"/>
that such a departure from primitive inte∣grity ever did, and ever will, occasion a withering from the life of true religion.</Q></P>
<P>To a friend who came to visit him on the 21<HI>st</HI> of the seventh month he said,
<Q>I feel that which lives beyond death and the grave, which is now an inexpressible com∣fort to me after a time of deep baptism that I have passed through, I believe my being continued here is in the will of Pro∣vidence, and I am fully resigned.</Q></P>
<P>His illness increasing he said but little on seventh-day the 22<HI>d</HI>; in the afternoon he was very low, and speechless about twelve hours; early on first-day morning he recruit∣ed a little, and gave directions about his coffin to a friend who sat up with him, being a joiner; continuing rather easier the fore∣part of that day and appearing cheerful, he expressed divers weighty sentences like fare∣well exhortations to some who came to see him; on second-day morning he sat up a considerable time, in the afternoon he ap∣peared lively and sensible, tho' very weak, thus expressing himself,
<Q>I am much re∣freshed with my master's sweet air, I feel more life, more light, more love and sweetness than ever before,</Q>
and often men∣tioned the divine refreshment and comfort he felt flowing like a pure stream to his in∣ward man, saying to those who were with him,
<Q>I may tell you of it, but you cannot feel it as I do.</Q></P>
<P>In the evening a young person coming in∣to the room, looking at her earnestly and af∣fectionately,
<PB N="331" REF="020377_0338_0FAF06A9F2785D48"/>
he said,
<Q>Deborah arose a mo∣ther in Israel,</Q>
and shortly after,
<Q>The sweetness that I feel;</Q>
then his difficulty of breathing increased, and being turned once or twice, he requested to be helped up, and was placed in his chair, in which he ex∣pired about the ninth hour on second-day night the 24<HI>th</HI> of the seventh month 1775, be∣ing aged near seventy, and a minister about 42 years, and was buried on the 26<HI>th</HI> in friends grave-yard at East-Nottingham, a large con∣course of people attending, after which a so∣lemn meeting was held.</P>

<P>SHE was religiously inclined from her youth, and when married, was a good example in her family as a wife and a parent, of an inoffensive life and conversation, and a diligent attender of religious meetings, until prevented by age and bodily infirmity: Her appearances as a minister were not fre∣quent, but savoury and in few expressions.</P>
<P>In her last illness she seem'd resigned ei∣ther to live or die, and by her sensible ex∣pressions and good advice to her children and others, she appeared in a living humble frame of mind, and signified,

<P>HE was born of religious parents, early settlers of Gwynedd, from whom he received a pious education, to which, with the visitation of divine grace, he so far at∣tended from early youth, that in the several characters of husband, father, master, and neighbour, with his hospitality and charita∣ble disposition to the poor, he was much en∣deared to his family, friends and neighbours. Being a man of integrity and a lover of peace, he endeavoured to promote it in others, and was remarkably <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndued with a happy talent

<P>In the stations of an elder and overseer which he filled for a number of years, he was exemplary and serviceable.

<P>The day before his decease, a friend who visited him, mentioned, what a comfortable reflection it must be to him, when drawing near to the close of life, that he had filled up the station alloted him in a good degree of faithfulness; he replied,

<HEAD>A Testimony from the Monthly-Meeting of <HI>Phi∣ladelphia,</HI> concerning <HI>SARAH MORRIS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SHE was born in this city, being the daughter of our ancient friends Anthony and Elizabeth Morris, who were careful to instruct her in the fear of the Lord, a dili∣gent attendance of our religious meetings, and an early acquaintance with the holy scriptures; the advantage whereof she at times expressed to be a great comfort to her∣self, and of benefit to others. Her father di∣ed when she was about seventeen years of age, and near his end gave this testimony respecting her,
<Q>That she had never disobey∣ed him, and was his comfort;</Q>
which we insert with desires it may so impress the minds of youth, that by duly regarding the divine command of obedience to parents, they may be their comfort, merit the like testimony, and secure peace to their own minds. She was endued with understand∣ing superior to many, which, with her soci∣able, agreeable disposition, occasioned her conversation in the younger part of her life to be sought and acceptable to such who were accounted wise in the estimation of the world; but from her religious inclination prefering the company of those who exceeded her in age and experience, she was mercifully pre∣served from the snares and temptations to levity and vanity by which many of the youth are too readily captivated.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="020377_0342_0FAF06ACF0DEB630"/>The state of mind and religious exercise she was brought under, through the early visitations of divine grace, being sensibly ex∣pressed in a short account written by herself, we think worthy to be preserved, directed as follows,</P>
<P><Q>To all to whose hands this may come, be it known,</Q></P>
<P><Q>That, I having been one who was born of religious parents, was by that means fa∣voured with a sober and virtuous educa∣tion, but what was far beyond all outward blessings, the Lord in his mercy was pleas∣ed to make very early impressions of reli∣gion on my soul, by his immediate grace and good spirit, and made me sensible of the touches of divine love when very young, and at times these merciful visita∣tions were continued from my very infan∣cy (and through every part of life) by which I was in a good degree preserved from the evils and vanities of the world, and not only so, but comforted and sup∣ported in every time of trouble and diffi∣culty, as there was a secret regard to that good hand which is, and ever will be the help of all those who put their trust in it. But tho' the Lord had so favoured me that I was made capable of being in some re∣spects serviceable amongst my acquaintance and friends, from a propensity in my na∣tural disposition (which is likewise a bless∣ing from Heaven) to assist or oblige those with whom I conversed; yet after it pleas∣ed
<PB N="336" REF="020377_0343_0FAF06ADDB7F6DC0"/>
God, by the death of a sister whom I entirely loved, to give me a fresh instance of the uncertainty and unsatisfactoriness of all temporal blessings, he was pleased to strengthen my desires after the enjoy∣ment of that which is eternal and fadeth not away; and strong cries were raised in my soul that I might be brought to a near∣er acquaintance, and a more constant a∣biding with him who is the beloved of souls, and who, by the secret touches of divine goodness, had raised such a hunger and thirst after righteousness, that my soul could not be satisfied short of it: I say, af∣ter it had pleased God thus to incline my mind to seek after a more full enjoyment of that inward life and virtue which is communicated and conveyed to the soul through the illumination of the holy spi∣rit, I was visited with sickness, in which I had so a near a prospect of eternity, that I seemed just entering into it; O! then, the emptiness and vanity of all the world; the pleasures and friendships of it appear∣ed in a clear and strong light; nothing then but the hope of an entrance into the kingdom of Heaven seemed of any value, and that hope the Lord was at that time pleased in some degree to afford me; but yet I thought I saw a great deficiency, and was made to desire of the Lord, that if it was his will to restore me, he might ena∣ble me to live more close to his teachings, and follow him more fully than I had hi∣therto
<PB N="337" REF="020377_0344_0FAF06AECD3A46B8"/>
done; but in order to this, a work of greater mortification than ever had been experienced by me, was necessary. Great distress of soul and affliction of bo∣dy was I brought into, insomuch that I knew not where, or what I was; such temptations and buffetings of Satan that I had till now been a stranger to, were suffered to beset me, in the absence of spi∣ritual comfort: and refreshment, yet in all this the Lord was very merciful, and let me see that his dealings with my soul were in order to qualify and fit for some fur∣ther service; O! then the solemn engage∣ments my soul was willing to enter into at this Bethel! If thou O Lord! will be with me in the way that I go, and give me bread to eat and raiment to put on, in a spiritual sense, and bring me to my hea∣venly father's house in peace, thou shalt be my God, and I will serve thee! And the Lord, who knew the tenderness of my heart (at that time, for it was his own work) was pleased graciously to shower down of the heavenly rain of his king∣dom, by which my soul was greatly com∣forted and refreshed in his presence; and in a true sight and sense of my own no∣thingness and inability to do any thing that was acceptable in the sight of God without his assistance, was my spirit great∣ly humbled before him, and a resignation wrought in my will to be given up in all things to him, who had thus enabled my
<PB N="338" REF="020377_0345_0FAF06AF44389CB8"/>
soul to praise his name upon the banks of deliverance from great and sore conflicts and troubles, which were unknown to any in that day, for then was the Lord my refuge and sure hiding place, and under the shadow of his wing was I kept, and in the sweet enjoyment of divine love, light and life, at times was made to say, surely nothing shall ever be able to make a separation from the love of God in Christ Jesus: But alas! this lasted not long, for when it was clearly shewn me what was required of my hands, which was to bear a public testimony for God, and to declare unto others what he had done for my soul, then consultations with flesh and blood began, tho' the merciful visitations of love were long continued unto me; yet doubts, fears and reasonings increased, so that great darkness and distress came upon me, nor could I now apply with that confi∣dence and trust as formerly, to him a∣lone who can help, but began to disclose something of my condition to others, from which time I was sensible that my strength decreased; yet all this while I was willing to hope that a fresh visitation might be sometime afforded, for without it, I saw my state very dangerous; what would I not then have done to have reco∣vered my former condition? I went un∣der great distress and perplexity day and night for some months, the comfortable refreshments and divine opening with
<PB N="339" REF="020377_0346_0FAF06B1CA4F7338"/>
which I had been so plentifully favoured, were withdrawn, and I left in unspeakable anguish and distress; under this sense of terror I cried to the Lord to shew me his will and enable me to perform it, but the sense of his love was so far withdrawn, and fears and doubts had so prevailed, that I began to question every thing, and by de∣grees the unwearied adversary hath so pre∣vailed, or it is so suffered for ends I know not, that I am at this time, according to my weak apprehension, left very much to myself without the sensation of divine love upon my soul, or the ability to seek after it, or rightly to wait for it, or to stir or move any way as to my soul, but, in a stupidity not to be described, stript of all inward comfort, and not able to take plea∣sure in any thing this world can afford.</Q></P>
<P>Being, through the mercy of the Lord, preserved under this close probation, and, in his time, graciously relieved by the quicken∣ing virtue of his divine presence and power, she, in great abasement and humiliation, be∣came resigned to his holy requirings, and appeared in public testimony in one of our religious meetings; being thus brought forth in the ministry, through great mortification of her own will, her appearance was much to the comfort and satisfaction of friends, it being evident to the sensible and judicious members of the church, that she was right∣ly called to this weighty work; and divers nearly sympa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>izing with her, were spiritual

helpers, watching over her in much love and tenderness; and through faithfulness to her gift, she increased in knowledge and experi∣ence, and became an able gospel minister, being found in doctrine, pertinent in ex∣hortation, clear and audible in utterance, and careful to adorn the doctrine she preach∣ed by a pious exemplary life and conversa∣tion.</P>
<P>Her first journey in the service of truth was to some adjacent meetings as companion to our valuable friend Margaret Ellis; being afterwards, through the efficacy of divine love, drawn forth to visit many of the meet∣ings in this province, New-Jersey and the yearly-meetings in Maryland and Long-Is∣land; and in the year 1764, in company with our friends Joyce Bene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et and Eliza∣beth Smith, attended that at Rhode-Island; though her religious labours were chiefly in this city, manifesting among us a steady uniform concern for the cause of truth, and preservation of true christian fellowship, not only in the exercise of her gift in the public ministry, wherein she was eminently favour∣ed, but also of our christian discipline among friends of her own sex, for which she was well qualified and of real use.</P>

in Great-Britain now reviving, the weight of the service, and her apprehension of be∣ing disqualified therefor, affected her so deeply, that she was reduced to such a low state of mind and body, her recovery ap∣peared doubtful; but after a distressing season of conflict, she was favoured with strength to communicate her concern to this meeting, and obtaining a certificate of the near sym∣pathy and concurrence of friends, she was left to proceed, with their free approbation, as the Lord might be pleased to furnish abi∣lity; and her affectionate niece Deborah Morris's offer to accompany her, being also concurred with, they embarked for London, in the third month 1772, where being ar∣rived, tho' continuing in a weak state of health, she was enabled to perform her visit to friends in most of the principal counties and towns from Exeter in the west as far north as Cumberland, and those called the Eastern-Counties; attending two yearly-meetings in London, and divers general meetings in other parts of the nation; and being favoured with strength beyond expec∣tation, and with that wisdom which truth gives to those who faithfully resign to its holy requirings, discharged her religious du∣ty to the edification of the churches and her own peace; returning h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e in the ninth month 1773, accompanied by her said niece, who had been truly helpful to her, and three friends from Great-Britain on a religious visit; her having been thus mercifully sustain∣ed

<P>Having, soon after her return, attended the general meeting at Shrewsbury, the quar∣terly-meeting of Bucks and some other meet∣ings, she united that winter with our valu∣able friends, M.

<P>In the fifth month 1774, she visited friends at New-York and Long-Island, attending the yearly-meeting there, and divers others; and in the same summer and fall, visited some meetings in New-Jersey and this province, besides diligently attending those in this city as she was enabled, being favoured in most of them with a lively edifying testimony.</P>
<P>For about six months before her departure, a dropsical disorder subjected her to great bodily weakness; yet her love to God, his truth and people, was so prevalent, that when unable to walk to a meeting, she was divers times carried to her seat; one of the last she attended in public, was on the 4<HI>th</HI> of the sixth month 1775, to which she was with great difficulty brought, and was ena∣bled to bear a lively testimony; affection∣ately expressing her great concern for the

It makes us humble, meek and wise, it is this teacher that cannot be removed; a guide into that righteous way, which if but lived in, would have kept off this impending storm. O! that they would even now but humbly seek to learn the christian warfare, and be earnestly engaged to fight under the ban∣ner of Christ, to know their own hearts lusts totally subdued.</Q>
At another time being in great pain, she cried out,
<Q>O sweet Lord Jesus, that thou wouldst be pleased to give me a little ease, who am an unwor∣thy creature, undeserving thy sweet pre∣sence; but thou art merciful, and thou, 0 Lord! knowest that nothing less can ease and comfort me; thy living presence is all I want.</Q>
And after the favour was
<PB N="344" REF="020377_0351_0FAF06B5FB84C930"/>
granted, which for an hour she enjoyed, she said,
<Q>Oh! how good is my God, thus to hear my feeble cry; O how sweet is this ease! All my pains are eased by one secret look from thee; O! that I could be thank∣ful enough for this favour; this sweet tho' short quiet, which we cannot get at but when thou, O father! pleases. O! that the people would but believe, that in thy peace their strength consists; and that they would more generally seek to know it be∣fore it is too late; but too many are con∣tented without witnessing the frequent re∣newings of divine love, in which only there is life, if they are but preserved from gross evils and go on in prosperity, they sit down easy and think all is well; but O! that they may not too late find their mistake, and that they have pleased themselves with favours which they have unthankfully received, and so stopt short of greater, by not desiring them, and more frequently than the day, waiting to know the renewings of that life, without which there is no life to the truly begotten children, and which would shew them, not only what they ought to do, but would give them strength to do it.</Q></P>
<P>Seventh month 2<HI>d</HI>; in a quiet sitting of some friends in her room, she said in sub∣stance,
<Q>If I may take the freedom to ex∣press my experiences of the Lord's graci∣ous dealings with me, when in a land of darkness and drought, where no water is,
<PB N="345" REF="020377_0352_0FAF06B6B3DF8698"/>
a land of pitts and deserts, beset as with noxious creatures, and amongst serpents and scorpions, from whence none could deliver but him who can open and none can shut; I have seen the necessity, after having done the will of God, to wait with patience to receive the promise of him who is the same to-day as yesterday, and will so continue forever. Many are the comfortable assurances in holy writ to those who keep the word of his patience;
<Q>I will keep such in the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the earth, to try them that dwell therein;</Q>
I have many times, my dear, may I not say my beloved friends, for so at seasons you have been to me, tho' at other times I hardly dare say so; I have many times been glad to feel a little opening of strength with my friends, and may say, I am thankful for this quiet solemn opportunity, for great have been and still are my trials, and close may be your provings; I don't speak it to discourage any, but I find without the re∣newings of divine love and life, we are incapable of keeping the word of his pa∣tience, being so frequently beset and sur∣rounded with weakness and infirmities; O! may you, my dear friends, who have been called and anointed for services, wit∣ness a renewed supply of holy oil, where∣by your lamps may be kept burning, and your lights shining; and experience the law to go forth, from Zion, and the word
<PB N="346" REF="020377_0353_0FAF06B7BA057C30"/>
of the Lord from Jerusalem, and remem∣ber your covenants made in the day of deep distress; may you be supported thro' every future difficulty and trial, and I thro' the present conflict; that when eve∣ry pool and channel of comfort shall be dried up, and all human help found un∣availing, we may witness him to be near, who hath promised, for the cry of the poor and for the sighing of the needy he would arise; therefore, cry mightily to him, that we may know him to do so for us; for I find, without sensibly feeling the drawing cords of his love, which opens and enlarges the heart, we cannot apply those gracious promises to our comfort; and when he draws, let not the cares of this life, nor slavish and unnecessary fears, prevent your following him faithfully, whatever afflictions may attend; O! may we be so preserved in his holy hand, as that nothing may be suffered to pluck us out of it, and so assisted to conduct, as to be found among that happy number who have come through many tribulations, where all sorrows and sighing will be done away and all tears wiped from our eyes, to join those who can acceptably sing the song of praise, having had their robes washed in the blood of the lamb and made white.</Q>
And on the 3<HI>d,</HI> tho' with some difficulty of utterance, said,
<Q>Though the floods beat high at times, and the waves roared, she was then sensible of the divine
<PB N="347" REF="020377_0354_0FAF06BA595605E0"/>
love being present, and in that love saluted her friends, as she hoped each one there had in a greater or lesser degree, known the sanctifying power of religion on their minds; she very earnestly and affection∣ately urged them to a more close and so∣lemn attention to this important work, not to rest satisfied short of witnessing daily advancing forward on the way; that when this earthly tabernacle was dissolved, we might have a well grounded hope of a house eternal in the Heavens, whose maker and builder was God. That our blessed Saviour had told his immediate followers, in his father's house were many mansions, and that he went to prepare a place for them, that where he was they might be also; and that tho' the sensible enjoyment of divine love was much withdrawn from many who had formerly been eminently favoured with its living influence; yet not to be discouraged, as living faith in Christ Jesus (tho' but in a small degree) was abundantly sufficient for our strength and safety; and as his divine love still continu∣ed with those who are far advanced and as on the verge of time, it would also be the guide and blessed guardian of the younger in years, as they humbly and steadily kept upon their watch, and paid a due obedience to the divine instructions of his holy spirit.</Q></P>
<P>The last night of her life, being in bodily pain, and under some discouragement of
<PB N="348" REF="020377_0355_0FAF06BA76891328"/>
mind, she was reminded of some late fa∣vours or divine love extended to her; after laying sometime in awful silence, she replied,
<Q>Now I see it to my comfort, that the Lord hath been with me through all this illness, and I, at times, knew it not, such was my distressed situation, it was hard for me to believe it.</Q>
Afterwards falling into a sweet sleep, she in about two hours awaked much refreshed, and remarked, she had not slept so sweetly in all her illness, for she had been in company with her father's God, mother's God and her God; asked her niece (Deborah Morris) who had with abundant care at∣tended on her, if she thought life would hold all night, who answering, she thought it might, as the night was far spent, she desi∣red her said niece would sit by her until the Lord came, (meaning to close her life) then slumbered again, and awakening, ad∣mired, saying,
<Q>It is strange I should sleep at such a time as this.</Q>
Being told her work was done, and it was a favour to her she could sleep, she replied,
<Q>I believe it is, and am thankful;</Q>
inquiring what time it was, on being told it was after three o'clock, she lifted up her hands as engaged in mental prayer; soon after uttered some words but not intelligibly, and seeming again to drop into a sweet sleep, neither stirred or spoke more, but continuing till between eight and nine o'clock, passed easily away, on the 24<HI>th</HI> of the tenth month 1775, in the se∣venty-second year of her age, and 31<HI>st</HI> of

<P>HE appeared early in the ministry, con∣tinued faithful, and died in good uni∣ty with the church. His ministry was live∣ly and edifying, in the exercise whereof, he several times travelled through this and the neighbouring colonies: And at the age of near seventy-years, performed a religious visit to the Delaware Indians, residing to the westward of Pennsylvania, which visit was cordially received, as appears from a copy of a speech made by one of their chiefs (captain White Eyes) and the delivery of a belt at the same time in token of friendship, at a meeting for worship in their town on the river Muskingum, which were produced to our meeting at his return.</P>
<P>In his last illness, he expressed his satis∣faction with the dutiful deportment of his children towards him as a parent, and gave
<PB N="350" REF="020377_0357_0FAF06BD19F979A0"/>
them salutary advice; exhorting them,
<Q>Not to give their minds too much to temporal things, nor seek after worldly enjoyments, but learn to get wisdom and understand∣ing, which would make them shine as stars in the firmament; and to remember their several duties, and be ready at the cock-crow, or at midnight; praying his God and father to be with them and bless them.</Q>
After a time of silence, he said,
<Q>I am at peace with all men. Lord thou hast been with me in times past, be with me in my last moments, and I pray my God and father, that he will bear me up as in the hollow of his hand, to my ever∣lasting home.</Q></P>
<P>In regard to outward affairs, he expressed himself in the following manner,
<Q>If the world would have lived in love and unity one with another, it appears to me, that no good thing would have been withhold∣en from us, but it seems to be dark times, and things lay very wide. But it looketh to me, there will be a gathering home from off the barren mountains and desert hills, of them that are little thought of at this time. Lord, let thy will be done and not mine. If it be thy will that I must depart from my brethren in the time of their trouble, I willingly yield in obedi∣ence. If it be thy will that I should be spared a while longer, I willingly bear my part of the burdens whatsoever thou pleasest to lay upon me.</Q>

<HEAD>A Testimony from <HI>Kingwood</HI> Monthly-Meeting in <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> concerning <HI>MARY HORNER.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SHE was born at Mansfield, in the coun∣ty of Burlington, New-Jersey, in the year 1736, of parents in membership with friends, and was educated in the profession of the truth as held by us. Her tender mind while in her minority, was sensibly reached with a divine visitation of the love of God, and as she grew to riper years, she was preserved in a good degree of circum∣spect walking in the fear of the Lord; her conversation being serious, sensible and guarded, and oftentimes her grave deport∣ment was useful as a check to her compani∣ons. In the year 1757 she was married to Isaac Horner, and filled the station of a faithful and prudent wife and mother. In the beginning of the year 1768, she appear∣ed in public as a minister, her testimony being short and lively. In the year 1770, she removed with her husband and family, to settle within the compass of this meeting,
<PB N="352" REF="020377_0359_0FAF06BE54799F78"/>
and has since resided among us. She was remarkable for her unreserved charitable openness and innocent freedom of deport∣ment towards all; and through the influ∣ence of the love of God shed abroad in her heart, by a life of unaffected piety, and a godly circumspection of conduct and de∣portment, she obtained a good report. She was divers times, with the concurrence of her friends, engaged in gospel love, in visit∣ing meetings abroad, and had good service in visiting families, not only within the com∣pass of this monthly-meeting, but others.</P>
<P>Having taken a cold, it brought on a de∣cay, under which she languished upwards of eight months, near half of which time she nevertheless attended meetings. During her indisposition, her quiet composure of spirit, and cheerful resignation to the will of her heavenly master was truly edifying. She told a friend who visited her not long before her departure, that
<Q>Though death appear∣ed a dark passage, yet all was light beyond it.</Q>
And to another, who at parting, bid her farewell, she said,
<Q>I shall fare well when I am rid of this body.</Q>
She was remarkably clear in her understanding, and said,
<Q>Though bodily weakness prevail∣ed, yet her spirit felt no diminution of strength;</Q>
and exhorted those about her, to place their reliance on the Lord alone, 'A confidence,' said she,
<Q>In which I have never been disappointed.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="353" REF="020377_0360_0FAF06BEF1C72230"/>One evening near her close, she broke forth into expressions of praise to the Almighty, and humble acknowledgments,
<Q>That he had to her, performed all his promises, had prepared and sanctified her, and brought her to that hour; and that she should praise him as long as she continued in the body, and at the conclusion, cheer∣fully surrender husband and children, and all that he had given her, into his hands.</Q></P>
<P>In or near her last hour, she beckoned her husband, to come and take his leave of her, and then composedly said,
<Q>Thou art a welcome messenger, thou art welcome, take me quickly.</Q></P>
<P>She died the 31<HI>st</HI> of the fifth month 1776, in the fortieth year of her age, having been engaged in the ministry upwards of 8 years.</P>

<P>HE was born of pious parents, and there∣by knew the advantage of a religious education, which he frequently expressed by way of encouragement to parents and youth, as a means by which he had in a good degree been guarded in the time of his youth, from the vanities of the world. Yet as he grew in years he clearly saw he wanted the experimental part of the christi∣an religion, without which he could not at∣tain
<PB N="354" REF="020377_0361_0FAF06BFB06E21E0"/>
to that which his soul exceedingly long∣ed for; and under a sense of this want, was brought at times very low, and for some years had to pass through a state of mourn∣ing and deep exercise, being baptized as un∣der the cloud and in the sea in a spiritual sense; which brought him to a passive sub∣mission to the divine will, so that it pleased the Lord, in the returns of his favour, to visit him with the day spring from on high; and having learned obedience through the things that he suffered, he gave up to the heavenly vision, and came forth in the mi∣nistry in a few words, mostly in scripture language, in great simplicity; and altho' not eloquent, yet being faithful in the little, he became much enlarged in his gift, having clear openings in the scriptures, and at times much favoured with clear prospects of the states of meetings and individuals, that he had to speak to secret and hidden things, in the demonstration of the spirit and with power, which reached the witness in many hearts. He was a father to the young in experience, and zealous to reprove lightness and vanity where he saw occasion.</P>
<P>He travelled in the work of the ministry, in several of the American provinces, and once to England, of which services we had comfortable accounts. He was zealous for the support of our christian discipline, was favoured with a good understanding, exem∣plary in his life and conversation, and lived much in the simplicity of the truth, which
<PB N="355" REF="020377_0362_0FAF06C0B693DCE0"/>
made him near to his friends, and a useful member in society. Being weak in body, a considerable time before his decease, he said,
<Q>It seemed as if his day's work was done, and nothing lay upon him;</Q>
observ∣ing that some worthy friends had of late been removed without much foresight of their latter end, and had not much to com∣municate, he said,
<Q>If it should be his case, he would not have it looked upon as in displeasure, for he was clear and easy in his mind, and that he believed his stay would not be long;</Q>
which proved accord∣ing to his prospect; for being taken with something of a quinsy followed by an ague, he said,
<Q>He thought that would be his last illness,</Q>
adding,
<Q>I have never been de∣sirous to know when my time was near at an end, but have long been desirous to live so as to be ready, and I think I am ready. I have endeavoured to be faithful in the discharge of my duty in every re∣spect, and have nothing lies against me, but seem at quiet. I have in other illnesses been pretty much resigned, yet there seem∣ed something of a choice to live, but in this I have not that choice, but I am rea∣dy.</Q>
He quietly passed away, after a short illness of about fifteen hours, on the 18<HI>th</HI> of the twelfth month 1776; aged seven∣ty-two years. Having been a minister about 40 years.</P>

<HEAD>A Testimony from <HI>Evesham</HI> Monthly-Meeting in <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> concerning <HI>HANNAH FOSTER.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SHE was the daughter of Enoch and Sarah Core, of Evesham aforesaid, and was born the 17<HI>th</HI> day of the tenth month 1710; her father dying while she was very young, left her and three other children un∣der the care of their mother, whose religi∣ous concern for them was very great; as some of us have heard our said friend often express both in public and private.</P>
<P>She was naturally of a cheerful dispositi∣on, and at times when young in years, she suffered an airy spirit to prevail so far as to lead her into lightness, yet, thro' divine fa∣vour, the solid instruction and example of her mother, had such influence on her mind, as to preserve her from gross evils; which we have often heard her express with awful reverence.</P>
<P>In the year 1729, she was married to our friend William Foster, and entered into the care of a family, at which time, the cares of this world had great effect on her mind, as some of her last expressions herein after mentioned will more clearly evince.</P>
<P>Some time after her marriage, it pleased the Lord to renew his visitation of love to her soul, and to shew her the vanity of all temporal enjoyments without his love; and she yielding obedience to the heavenly vision, and being given up to serve the Lord, had
<PB N="357" REF="020377_0364_0FB087E0812AEB70"/>
a gift in the ministry committed to her, in which we have reason to believe, she was in a good degree faithful to improve, and through divine aid, became a lively minister.</P>
<P>She visited most of the meetings on the continent of America, except some part of Virginia and Carolina; and the accounts received of her religious labour in the mini∣stry, were comfortable and satisfactory. Her humble awful waiting in religious meetings was edifying; she was much con∣cerned that good order might be preserved, and careful to example and admonish her offspring in the fear of the Lord, more than to influence their minds to seek after the treasures that are transitory and perishing. A near sympathizer with the afflicted, either in body or mind, often visiting such and administring to their relief.</P>
<P>Towards the latter part of her time, her health was much impaired, yet she grew more lively in the ministry, and in some of the last meetings she attended, was en∣abled in a solemn manner, to invite the youth to join the heavenly call of God, and to be faithful in their gifts, and then they would be raised like an army in his power, to subdue the works of darkness, which she saw much prevailed amongst them; remarking some parts of the epistle from our last yearly-meeting, respecting some hopeful youths who attended that solemn, service.</P>
<P><PB N="358" REF="020377_0365_0FAF06C563C05BE8"/>In her last sickness, which tho' short, was sharp, she was preserved in much patience and stillness; and when it was apprehended she was near expiring, a friend who came to visit her, taking leave of those attending her, she held out her hand to the said friend and desired to be raised up, when with con∣siderable difficulty she said,
<Q>That there was a time when her heart and mind was much set on the world and the things of it, and it prospered with her according to her desire; but she blessed the name of the Lord, who soon let her see the vanity and emptiness of all worldly treasure, and that she was thankful he had enabled her to yield obedience to the heavenly visitati∣on, and in some degree to answer his re∣quirings, for it now yielded her more peace, than if she had possession of the whole world, if it was of tenfold more value than it is; and that her prayers had often been to the Lord, that he might yet favour the rising generation with the like visitation of his love,</Q>
with some other words which could not be understood. She appeared in a sweet frame of mind, and af∣ter a short pause, took her solemn leave of the said friend; after which she lay still, and in a few hours quietly departed this life, on the 14<HI>th</HI> of the first month 1777, and was buried in friends burying-ground at Evesham the 17<HI>th</HI> of the same, where a so∣lemn meeting was held; aged sixty-six and a minister upwards of 40 years.</P>

<HEAD>A Testimony from the <HI>Falls</HI> Monthly-Meeting in <HI>Bucks</HI> county, concerning <HI>JOSEPH WHITE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AS the memory of the just is pronounced blessed, we think it expedient to give forth a testimony concerning this our e∣steemed friend.</P>
<P>He was born at the Falls the 28<HI>th</HI> of the eleventh month 1712-13; being young when his father died, he was brought up under the care of his relations and friends: And through the early extendings of hea∣venly regard whilst young, and attending to the teachings of divine grace, he was led and preserved from many of the follies and extravagances incident to unthinking youth. About the twentieth year of his age he ap∣peared in public testimony in our religious meetings, and continuing in a good degree faithful to the measure of light and grace communicated, he grew in his gift, and be∣came a lively and able minister.</P>
<P>He was naturally of an open cheerful disposition, and honestly concerned for the promotion of piety and virtue, and for the support and maintenance of good order in the church; for which service he was emi∣nently gifted, and truly serviceable amongst us, being often concerned that the authority of truth might be kept up in all our meet∣ings of discipline, and that true judgment might be placed upon the disorderly and irreclaimable. He was exemplary in his
<PB N="360" REF="020377_0367_0FAF06C6805FE6C8"/>
life and conversation, a diligent and timely attender of our religious meetings when health of body permitted; and was often favoured therein in public testimony and supplication, much to the comfort and edi∣fication of the truly humble waiters. And altho' he had a large gift in the ministry, he many times sat meetings in silence, wait∣ing upon the Lord, not being hasty or for∣ward in the exercise of his gift; but careful not to minister without the heavenly life and power that first raised him up in the ministry, whereby his public service was greatly to the consolation and refreshment of many.</P>
<P>He several times had a concern to visit the churches abroad, and with the concur∣rence of this meeting, visited many of the meetings of friends in this and several of the adjacent provinces, and once through some parts ot Maryland, Virginia and North-Carolina: And having for some considera∣ble time been under a weighty concern to pay a religious visit to friends in several parts of Europe, he with the concurrence and unity of his friends took shipping for that purpose in the year 1758, and after a short passage landed in England, and having pretty generally visited friends meetings in England and Ireland, and some parts of Wales, he returned to his family and friends, having been from home in truth's service near three years: And at his return from
<PB N="361" REF="020377_0368_0FAF06C746E90EE8"/>
these visits produced certificates of friends unity and good satisfaction with him, and his public service amongst them.</P>
<P>He was divers times appointed and en∣gaged in the service of visiting families, be∣ing well qualified for that weighty service.</P>
<P>He much loved the company and conver∣sation of his friends; was a loving and af∣fectionate husband, a tender parent and a good neighbour, generally beloved by his friends and others that knew him, being in several respects useful and serviceable in the neighbourhood where he lived.</P>
<P>He was attended from his youth at times, with a pain at his breast, with intermissions of health, sometimes for years, and at other times but short; but as he advanced further in age, intermissions of health grew short and pain increased, which brought on other bodily infirmities, which he bore with pa∣tience and resignation, often craving he might not be off his watch when his pains were exquisite, nor his faith fail in the time of trial, believing it to be the goodness of God, through his thus dealing with him, more and more to wean him from all out∣ward connections and nearest ties of nature, that being as the pure gold, refined through the furnace, he might with triumph join the redeemed that were gone before, which he at times had a foretaste and evidence of; but the time when, as he himself sometimes expressed, he did not then see, believing it to be consistent with divine wisdom to keep it hid from him.</P>
<P><PB N="362" REF="020377_0369_0FAF06C827E12310"/>The latter part of his time for several months, he slept but litte in the night sea∣son, being at times engaged in reverent in∣tercessions and divine contemplation, and appeared to be waiting for the solemn mo∣ment.</P>
<P>He lived in the compass of the Falls par∣ticular meeting until a few years before his death, and then removed to Makefield, (a branch of the same monthly-meeting,) and having for some months felt strong desires (if favoured with health) to go to the Falls meeting, and on a monthly-meeting day set out to go there; but the weather being cold and he in a weak state of health, soon found himself unable to perform the journey, and returned home. But sometime after feeling his bodily strength somewhat restored, and love renewed, he set out, in company with his wife, one first-day morning, and got to the meeting where he was favoured with an open time in public testimony, much to the satisfaction of those present. After the meet∣ing was over and friends gone out, a friend being desirous of speaking to him, not seeing him out of doors, returned into the house, and found him sitting on a seat, unable to move without help; the friend assisted him, and took him to his house, where he was taken care of: The fit being of the paraly∣tick kind, was much more favourable than at some other times, tho' it continued eb∣bing and flowing for several hours; in which
<PB N="363" REF="020377_0370_0FAF06C91C5B3378"/>
time he expressed several things, some of which being then taken down, are nearly as follows.</P>
<P>Being asked by his son Samuel how it was with him; he answered,
<Q>I dont know but that I am near my end. My desire at this time for thee is, that thou seek unto the Lord for assistance, to govern thee in thy conduct in this fluctuating life, for I have found him to be a sure help and counsellor to me; and if thou follow after him in truth and sincerity, as I have endeavoured to do, he will be unto thee a sufficient director, a teacher that cannot be removed into a corner: I have not been anxious to gather a portion of this world, nor make to myself mammon of unrighteousness, for I think I have seen a snare that has at∣tended many young people on these ac∣counts. I have ever from my youth had a desire to be more in substance than in shew: Let me appear as I might in the sight of men, their praise I sought not for; but I have sought the honour of God, therefore there is a place where no trouble shall annoy, prepared for me as a reward for obedience: You that stay, be more humble, and when trouble awaits you, look not upon nor trust to the arm of flesh for assistance, but stay yourselves upon him who suffered for you, for me, and for all mankind; for I have for sometime believed, and lived in the hopes thereof, and am now in measure confirmed, of
<PB N="364" REF="020377_0371_0FAF06C9B7158448"/>
more glorious things yet to be revealed to the church of Christ, and that further and greater discoveries will yet be made, with respect to the christian religion than ever yet has been since the apostasy.</Q></P>
<P>And after a short pause he broke forth in these expressions,
<Q>The door is open, I see an innumerable company of saints, of an∣gels, and of the spirits of just men, which I long to be unbodied to be with, but not my will, but thy will be done O Lord! I cannot utter nor my tongue express, what I feel of that light, life and love that at∣tends me, which the world cannot give, neither can it take away from me. My sins are washed away by the blood of the Lamb that was slain from the foundation of the world: All rags and filthiness are taken away, and in room thereof love and good will for all mankind: O that we may become more united in the church mili∣tant, and nearer resemble the church triumphant! O that we all might make such an end as I have in prospect, for its all light, all life, all love and all peace, the light that I see is more glorious than the sun in the firmament; come Lord Je∣sus Christ, come when thou pleases, thy servant is ready and willing; into thy hands I commit my spirit, not my will, but thy will be done O Lord! Let this mortal body be committed to the dust, be with me, with my children and my grand∣children; be with all them that love thee,
<PB N="365" REF="020377_0372_0FAF06CC5B12C558"/>
that love thy appearance. O the pains that I feel, that attend this mortal body, they are more comely to me than jewels! I rejoice in my sighs and groans, for to me they are most melodious; I am near to enter that harmony with Moses and the Lamb, where they cry holy, holy, holy, I cannot express the joy I feel. My heart (if it were possible) would break for joy: If any inquire after me, after my end, let them know all is well with me.</Q></P>
<P>Many more weighty expressions he spoke, which not being taken down, cannot be re∣collected.</P>
<P>The next day his pain abating, and find∣ing himself somewhat relieved from his dis∣order, he was taken to his own house, where he remained in a weak state of health for sometime, being unable to go much abroad. And one night some short time before his death, his pain had been sharp the forepart of the night, but the latter part it abating, his wife lay down by him, and fell asleep, but he as usual slept not, but after some∣time called to his wife in these words:
<Q>My dear, I believe I must take my leave of thee. I have never seen my end till now, and now I see it is near, and the holy an∣gels enclose me around, waiting to receive me;</Q>
his wife asked him if she should call up the children, he said, he did not see any thing further he had to say to them, except to his son Joseph, who being called, and he having exprest what he had on his mind,
<PB N="366" REF="020377_0373_0FAF06CC7979BAD8"/>
was much spent, and appeared as tho' he was near his desired port; but after some∣time he revived, with these words,
<Q>Life is yet strong in me and will not yield;</Q>
thus he continued the few concluding days, waiting in resignation and retiredness of mind, until the repeated returns of the pa∣ralytick complaint reduced his faculties and senses so, that he knew not what was done for some days, and departed in much still∣ness as in a sleep, the 10<HI>th</HI> day of the third month 1777, and was decently interr'd in friends burying-ground at the Falls meet∣ing-house, the 12<HI>th</HI> of the same; his body being attended to the grave by a number of friends and neighbours.</P>
<P>May we under the consideration of our great loss of him, and many other faithful labourers in the Lord's vineyard, now re∣moved from us, be excited so to follow their footsteps, that with them, we may be par∣takers of that incorruptible inheritance, which is reserved for the righteous, when time here shall be no more.</P>

<P>PRECIOUS is the memory of the righ∣teous, those who have been bright ex∣amples of holiness in their day, and therein preachers to others in life and conversation: It lives in our hearts to give this short testi∣mony, that such was our ancient and be∣loved friend Joseph Gibson, an elder of this meeting. He was born at Woodbury in the year 1690, and became early acquainted with the seasoning virtue of truth, which pre∣served him in a good degree, from the vani∣ties of youth, and made him in love with plainness and sobriety while young; by a watchful attention to this divine principle, he attained a pious and innocent stability of conduct through life, not often equalled; that it may be justly said, he was
<Q>An Is∣raelite indeed in whom there was no guile.</Q>
A diligent attender of meetings, and a lively example there, in awful hum∣ble labour for that bread which strengthens and nourishes the soul; wherein he continu∣ed steadfast to his concluding period. We could enlarge, but conclude with the words of the Psalmist,
<Q>Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace;</Q>
which we believe was in an eminent degree the case of this our friend, who "Being dead, yet speaketh."</P>

<P>She was religiously inclined when young; and about the fifteenth year of her age, by a fresh visitation of divine love, was en∣gaged to seek after divine wisdom; so that she became an early example of piety and virtue; an encourager and promoter of vir∣tuous inclinations in her companions and acquaintance; her steady conduct, and kind and exemplary conversation, gained the love and esteem of her friends and neighbours▪</P>
<P>After her marriage, which was near the beginning of the twenty-third year of her age, she continued a diligent attender of

meetings for worship and discipline when ability of body would admit; and when there, was of an exemplary solid deportment, so that she was favoured to become a useful member of society, of sound judgment.</P>
<P>She first appeared in the ministry in the second month 1771, and tho' not large was pertinent in testimony; often admonishing such as were forgetful of their known duties, and sharply reproving where a wrong spirit prevailed: Yet frequently speaking com∣fortably to the bowed down mourners in Zion, with whom she often travelled in spi∣rit, endeavouring according to her ability, to lend a hand of help to such.</P>
<P>The last meeting she was at, was on a first-day, about a week before she died, in which she was much favoured, and spake concerning Israel's journey from Egypt to Canaan, advising not to settle short of a pos∣session in the promised land. As she was walking home with her husband in a solid frame of mind, she said,
<Q>In my father's house are many mansions;</Q>
signifying,
<Q>If she might be favoured with one of the least of them, she would be content.</Q></P>
<P>She departed this life, the 19<HI>th</HI> of the fourth month 1777, and was interr'd in the family burying-ground on the 21<HI>st</HI> of the same month; in the fortieth year of her age and 7<HI>th</HI> of her ministry.</P>

<P>About the year 1728, a remarkable vi∣sitation being extended to friends in this city, the hearts of divers were humbled, and, in the efficacy of divine love, several were constrained to open their mouths in our re∣ligious assemblies, in public testimony, and acknowledgments of the Lord's goodness and gracious dealings with their souls.</P>
<P>Our worthy friend Daniel Stanton, in his journal, mentions this as a memorable time, and names the several friends who then came forth in the ministry, of which num∣ber this friend was one; who being faith∣ful, grew in her gift, and not only laboured in this city, but divers times was drawn forth in the love of the gospel, to visit the meetings in other parts of Pennsylvania and New-Jersey. And in the year 1744, in com∣pany with our dear friend Mary Evans, vi∣sited the meetings of friends in New-En∣gland; and was several times engaged with others in the weighty and profitable work of visiting the familes of friends in this city, and through divers meetings in the country;
<PB N="371" REF="020377_0378_0FAF06D0845AF5B0"/>
in which services, her labours were accepta∣ble, being qualified in a peculiar manner for that work.</P>
<P>Her ministry was lively, and delivered in much innocency and brokenness of spirit. Being a woman of integrity, she loved chris∣tian candor and plain dealing, and was preserved clear in her understanding, and in her love to truth. During her illness, which was short, she was favoured with an earnest of that divine peace and rest which is prepared for the righteous.</P>

<P>OUR beloved friend Elizabeth Shipley, daughter of Samuel Levis, was born in the Township of Springfield, and county of Chester in Pennsylvania, on the 26<HI>th</HI> day of the tenth month 1690.

She travelled in the service thereof in this land, both southward and northward in the early part of her time, and visited Barbados in company with Jane F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nn, in the year 1725; but as she kept few minutes, we have little account of her labours abroad.</P>
<P>In the year 1728, she was married to William Shipley, near Springfield aforesaid, where they lived until the year 1736, about which time they removed with their family to this place; and we believe she was an in∣strument in the Lord's hand, to settle a meeting here, and gather many to it. In 1743, she embark'd for England with our friend Esther White, and the vessel going by way of North-Carolina, while there, they visited some meetings in that province; after which they sailed again, and arrived at Liverpool on the 26<HI>th</HI> of the seventh month, and in gospel love, visited general∣ly the meetings of friends in England, Scot∣land and Ireland, to their own satisfaction; and, as appears by accounts from friends there, to the comfort of many. She also made several short visits to the neighbouring provinces; and in the seventieth year of her age, in company with our friend Hannah Foster, visited several of the northern pro∣vinces.

<P>Her deportment in meetings was grave and solid, her gift in the ministry lively and edifying, in prayer awful and weighty, not being forward in appearing.</P>
<P>Although her natural strength was much abated in the latter part of her time, yet her faculties remained bright, and her ministry accompanied with life and power.</P>
<P>In the time of her last illness, as several friends who came to visit her were sitting by her, she appeared filled with divine pow∣er, and spoke in a lively manner, of the drawings of the father's love to bring her to settle in this place, and said, that his pro∣mises had been fulfilled to her; advising to faithfulness in doing the work of their day; that for her own part, she was as a shock of corn fully ripe, and should shortly be gathered to the haven of rest.</P>

<P>OUR beloved friend Esther White, daughter of Thomas Canby, of the county of Bucks in Pennsylvania, was born in the second month 1700. In her young years she loved to attend religious meetings, and to see friends behave solid therein, being herself an example of piety. She married John Stapler, of the county aforesaid; and being called to the work of the ministry, she became a faithful labourer. About the thirty-fourth year of her age, her husband was removed by death; after which she married John White, and in the year 1739 removed with their family to this place.</P>
<P>In the spring of the year 1743, she, in company with our friend Elizabeth Shipley, sailed for England by way of North-Caro∣lina, and while there, visited some meetings in that province, then embarked, and ar∣rived at Liverpool in the seventh month fol∣lowing, and in gospel love, visited the meet∣ings of friends generally through England, Ireland and Scotland, to their own satisfacti∣on, and, as appears by accounts received, to the comfort and edification of many; and returned home in the latter part of the year 1745, to the joy of her friends and family.</P>
<P>In the year 1750, she visited most of the meetings of friends in Maryland, Virginia
<PB N="375" REF="020377_0382_0FAF06D3424C0340"/>

<P>She was an useful member of society, and a woman of uncommon cheerfulness of spi∣rit, although largely experienced in afflicti∣ons; through which she was mercifully sup∣ported by divine sufficiency; and being in∣structed in sorrow, had a sympathizing heart with the afflictions of others, and was rea∣dy to communicate to their relief both in spirituals and temporals. Her deportment was grave and solid, her ministry lively and edifying, even to old age. She was frequent in exhorting and encouraging friends to faithfulness in these times of great trial and outward commotion; that they might, with the wise builder, dig deep, and experience their foundation to be laid sure, that neither winds nor floods might move them. She was careful to maintain brotherly love, sometimes saying, that
<Q>Love was her life, that she could not live without it;</Q>
and being livingly sensible of the preciousness thereof, was desirous to promote it in others.</P>
<P><PB N="376" REF="020377_0383_0FAF06D5C990E5F8"/>After a life in which she had to endure several long and trying seasons of sickness, and to pass through many deep baptisms of sorrow, through which she was supported with becoming cheerfulness, patience and resignation; she departed this life, on the 5<HI>th</HI> day of the twelfth month 1777, in the seventy-eighth year of her age, having been a minister upwards of 50 years; and on the 7<HI>th</HI> of the same month and 1<HI>st</HI> of the week, was interr'd in friends burying-ground in Wilmington; being much beloved by her neighbours, her funeral was accompanied by many friends and others, and was a so∣lemn opportunity.</P>

<P>HE was born in the city of Worcester, in Old-England, in the year 1686. His parents being of the church of England, educated him in that way during his abode with them, which was until he was about fourteen years of age. In the year 1700 he
<PB N="377" REF="020377_0384_0FAF06D6B6ABBE28"/>
arrived at Philadelphia, and going into New-Jersey, there resided until twenty-one years of age.</P>
<P>He was convinced of the truth about the year 1708, and in 1712 appeared in the ministry, being then in the twenty-sixth year of his age: Having, since his convince∣ment, undergone many sore conflicts, by reason of a backwardness to comply with the Lord's requirings whereunto he had di∣vers times been disobedient through diffi∣dence and weakness, but at length he gave up, and therein found peace.</P>
<P>After his marriage, he resided about twelve years at Nottingham, in Chester coun∣ty Pennsylvania, and then removed to Deer-Creek where he continued. He was of an innocent life and harmless conversation; and in him were blended those truly chris∣tian virtues which render religion lovely and desirable; even the irreligious esteemed him an ornament to the christian profession. Being very conversant in the holy scriptures, and favoured with a retentive memory, he was enabled to quote them with propriety, and very often suitably apply them to in∣struction and edification.</P>
<P>Divine love, as witnessed by the believers in Christ, was a subject upon which he fre∣quently expressed himself, in engaging and persuasive terms; inviting others to come and be made partakers of so glorious a trea∣sure; adding,
<Q>It had been the crown and

<P>Of earthly treasure he possessed little, but he appeared to be one of those poor of this world, whom the apostle James mentions, as
<Q>Chosen by God, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom, which he hath promised to them that love him.</Q>
In this happy situation he was supported with christian fortitude, through times of adversity and deep affliction.</P>
<P>His wife dying in the ninth month 1777, to whom he had been an affectionate com∣panion upwards of sixty years, he did not long survive her, but, about four months afterwards, was visited with his last illness, in which he suffered much pain, but was composed; some days before his departure he grew easy, and in his latter moments, when exhausted nature scarcely left him strength to utter himself intelligibly, he la∣mented the state of the careless and uncon∣cerned, who did not duly and timely con∣sider their latter end.</P>
<P>He seemed very desirous to be dissolved and be with Christ; and on the 8<HI>th</HI> of the first month 1778, as a shock of corn fully ripe, he was removed from works to rewards, in the ninety-third year of his age; leaving behind him the savour of a good name, be∣ing generally beloved by people of all ranks and denominations who knew him.

<P>HE was born (by his own account) in Pembrokeshire, in the principality of Wales, in the year 1683, and was in his youth an earnest seeker after righteousness among divers forms of religion, until he became measurably convinced of the prin∣ciple of truth as held by friends, by pe∣rusing William Penn's key to christian knowledge, before he had much if any out∣ward acquaintance with them: And coming over to this country when a young man, he soon after joined with friends in religious fellowship; and being faithful to the ma∣nifestations of divine grace in his heart, he had a gift in the ministry bestowed upon him; and tho' not large, was savoury and edifying; which, together with his exem∣plary life and conversation, manifested him to be an heavenly minded man, much re∣deemed from the love and spirit of this world.</P>
<P>He was not anxious about the increase of outward riches, but easy and content with a small share thereof; so much as served for bodily support in great simplicity and plain∣ness, he thankfully received; having a tes∣timony against all superfluity, and every thing tending to exalt the mind of man, or
<PB N="380" REF="020377_0387_0FAF06D94249EC18"/>
promote worldly greatness in any degree; seeking above all, the kingdom of Heaven and the righteousness thereof.</P>
<P>He was a lover of peace amongst brethren and in his neighbourhood; and by precept and example, laboured to promote it; being at times concerned to travel about on foot, even in advanced age, to his friends houses, and pay short visits in true christian love, and drop weighty and edifying hints, tend∣ing to stir up the pure mind; and scarcely any thing was said by him at any time but what had a tendency that way.</P>
<P>He was a remarkable and worthy exam∣ple, in constantly and early attending our religious meetings, until upwards of ninety years of age; when through weakness and infirmity, he was confined at home, and underwent great bodily affliction with true christian fortitude and resignation to the di∣vine will, patiently waiting his change; which was on the 29<HI>th</HI> of the sixth month 1778; aged about ninety-five, and a mini∣ster near 70 years.</P>

<PB N="381" REF="020377_0388_0FAF06D9FA052640"/>
among us according to ability, in the sup∣port of the discipline; of a meek and quiet spirit, careful not to give just occasion of offence to any. He was appointed an elder in the year 1772, in which station he con∣ducted to good satisfaction.</P>
<P>In the early part of the eighth month 1777, he was taken unwell, and being un∣der great bodily pain, often begged for pa∣tience, saying, he was afraid to ask for any thing else. After he had been confined a∣bout two weeks, his pain somewhat abating, he called his children together, and spoke to them as follows:
<Q>It looks as if I may shortly be taken from you, and I think I have nothing to charge myself with, in regard to bringing you up; I have with great care watched over your morals, and anxiously endeavoured by example, to teach you to walk in the fear of the Lord; but a backward disposition prevailing, which I fear, has sometimes kept me from doing the good I might have done in the world, has at times, when my heart has been earnestly engaged for you, caused me to keep silence, when it might have been profitable to have thus addressed you: Look to the Lord my children, and ask of him to direct your ways. He must be the support of youth as well as of old age. It is him, and him alone you must cleave to, if ever you expect to find peace that will be lasting. It is not moral rectitude, go∣ing to meeting, or any outward acts of
<PB N="382" REF="020377_0389_0FAF06DAB1A968D0"/>
devotion only, that will do for you. Reli∣gion is an inward work, and true worship must be performed in the heart, by quiet∣ly waiting on him who is the rock of ages. I know by experience what I say, there∣fore earnestly desire you to look to the Lord, live near him, and let his fear di∣rect you in all you undertake. Keep out of the noises and confusions that are in the world, 'tis all delusion. To be blest with the presence of the Lord in a dunge∣on, is preferable to liberty enjoyed in palaces without it. And if it should please the Lord to take me from you, tho' we may part for a season, yet if we walk in his ways, we shall hereafter meet in eter∣nal bliss.</Q></P>
<P>His disorder increasing, his pain at times was very great, which he was enabled to bear with a good degree of christian resig∣nation; often desiring he might be endued with patience to hold out to the end. And altho' his outward tabernacle gradually de∣cayed, yet the seasonable and lively expressi∣ons which he at times uttered, evidenced that his inward man was frequently re∣newed.</P>
<P>A few weeks before his departure, several friends coming to visit him, after a seasona∣ble time of silence, he spoke as follows.</P>
<P><Q>I have often of late been led to examine myself, to see what it is that keeps me back, sometimes I think I see death ad∣vancing swift, and at other times quite
<PB N="383" REF="020377_0390_0FAF06DB7A3590C8"/>
gone; at this time in particular, I have been led to consider whether there remains any thing for me to do, and if I have any thing in my heart against any person, that my love is not yet perfect; and upon a strict examination, I find nothing but love to mankind universally. I have been great∣ly tried with pain of body, and poverty and barrenness of spirit, but through mer∣cy have been preserved from murmuring; and I have a hope, that when I put off this body, I shall be at rest; and that hope is an anchor to the soul.</Q></P>
<P>A day or two before his departure, his pain much abated, and tho' he was reduced very low, yet was preserved in much calm∣ness and serenity of mind, saying,
<Q>He thought his dissolution was near; that he had done with every thing below, and ex∣pected the change to him would be a hap∣py one, believing a place of rest was pre∣pared for him.</Q></P>

Some years afterwards he was concerned that a meeting might be settled, which was allowed to be held at his house at times for several years; when the number of friends increasing, they concluded to build a meeting house, which our said friend zealously promoted.

He was much concerned for the welfare of the young and rising generation, often cau∣tioning and exhorting friends in their seve∣ral stations, strictly to examine the great duty and charge committed to their trust; and in a particular manner, his offspring, that they would mutually live in love with each other, and that they might be careful to bring up their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</P>

<HEAD>A Testimony from the Monthly-Meeting of <HI>Phila∣delphia,</HI> concerning <HI>MARY PEMBERTON.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SHE was the daughter of Nathan and Mary Stanbury, of this city, who were removed by death in her tender age, after which she was put under the care of our friends Richard and Hannah Hill, by whom she was religiously educated: She was en∣dued with good natural understanding, and being obedient to the discoveries of divine grace in her own mind, she experienced a growth and advancement in the life of reli∣gion, and through its gradual work, be∣came a useful and active member in the church, being many years in the station of an elder and overseer. Her conversation was lively and instructive, her deportment solid and exemplary, and in our religious meetings, it was often apparent she was fa∣voured with the preparation of a broken heart and contrite spirit for the solemn per∣formance of divine worship. She felt the affliction of others with tender sympathy, and was enabled through divine help to bear her own, which were various and proving, with great resignation and christian forti∣tude. She was first joined in marriage to Richard Hill; and sometime after his de∣cease, to our worthy friend Robert Jordan; and lastly, in the year 1747, to our valued friend Israel Pemberton lately deceased; and
<PB N="387" REF="020377_0394_0FAF06E10BC127C0"/>
through the several vicissitudes of life, she was favoured to persevere with great stability and prudence.</P>
<P>The following was found among her pa∣pers after her decease, by the date whereof it is supposed to have been wrote on an oc∣casion of very deep and uncommon afflic∣tion.</P>
<P><Q>Fourth month 16<HI>th</HI> 1761. This being a day of great salvation, wherein the di∣vine power hath manifestly appeared in bringing relief and succour to my distress∣ed soul, and working deliverance for me which no human means could have effect∣ed; I earnestly desire, in the depth of hu∣mility and awful reverence, that it may be a day never forgotten by me, but that thanksgivings and living-praises may fill my heart to the Lord Jehovah, in whom is everlasting strength, whose arm alone hath brought salvation, blessed be his name, his faithfulness faileth not those whose trust and confidence is in him.</Q></P>
<P>The removal of her dear husband, into a state of exile in the ninth month 1777, was a renewed affliction to her, which she ap∣prehended, as she expressed to a friend, might tend to shorten her stay in this world.</P>
<P>She fell into a gradual decline and weak∣ness of body during his absence, which, though it increased upon her, she did not keep her bed but about four or five weeks, in which time she often expressed herself in a lively manner. On the 23<HI>d</HI> of the ninth
<PB N="388" REF="020377_0395_0FAF06E173EF45D8"/>
month in the morning, her husband sitting with her, she said,
<Q>It is now evident to me, my dear, we must soon part, we have passed through many deep trials; there is nothing between us but true love and great affection, I hope thou wilt be kept in true resignation; I had some hope of continuing sometime longer, both on thy account and for the sake of our dear grand-daughter, but I am not solicitous about it, not very solicitous.</Q></P>
<P>The afternoon of the same day, being in a sweet frame of mind, she said,
<Q>They who live near the spring of life, are sensi∣ble their change will be for the better, a happy change from a state of deep afflic∣tion;</Q>
and sometime after said,
<Q>The spring of life is often opened for the re∣freshment of the weary travellers.</Q></P>
<P>Tenth month 17<HI>th.</HI> Being low in body and mind, one of her daughters present, she said,
<Q>Whenever my mind is turned to think of getting better, I am engaged to desire to be kept under the Lord's notice, who hath been good to me; the wonder∣ful counsellor, the everlasting father, the prince of peace; few women, have had such s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enes to pass through as I have had, but I have been favoured beyond what I expected.</Q>
About an hour before her de∣parture, she said,
<Q>Blessed father, look down upon me if it be thy holy will.</Q>
And shortly after said,
<Q>Dearest Lord, take me to thyself; there is joy in Heaven, there
<PB N="389" REF="020377_0396_0FAF06E238AC1E20"/>
is joy in Heaven.</Q>
After which she fell into a sweet sleep, and peacefully breathed her last, on the 25<HI>th</HI> of the tenth month 1778, aged seventy-four years. And on the 27<HI>th</HI> was interr'd in friends burying-ground in this city.</P>

<HEAD>A Testimony from <HI>Wilmington</HI> Monthly-Meeting in the county of <HI>New-Castle</HI> on <HI>Delaware,</HI> concerning <HI>DAVID FERRIS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HE was the son of Zachariah and Sarah Ferris, and was born in Stratford, in Connecticut government, New-England, the 10<HI>th</HI> of the third month 1707. His parents being presbyterians, brought him up in that way, his mother being religiously disposed, and much concerned for her offspring, fre∣quently gave them good advice and admo∣nition, which had some good effect with this our friend, as he hath often been heard to express.</P>
<P>We find by some remarks he left, that about the twelfth year of his age, he was frequently visited and called unto by the divine monitor in his heart, to forsake evil and youthful vanities which he delighted in, and by being in a good degree faithful there∣to, was for a time, preserved from them; but for want of attending to that which would have continued to preserve him, the pleasures and vanities of this world got hold of his mind, so that he took much delight in airy and vain company, musick and dancing, and such like amusements, until about the twentieth year of his age; when
<PB N="391" REF="020377_0398_0FAF06E3D56831B0"/>
it pleased the Lord to visit him with a sore fit of sickness, which proved of lasting ad∣vantage to him, as it occasioned him to take up a fresh resolution, to forsake the evil of his ways, and turn to the Lord with full purpose of heart, which he was, thro' mer∣cy, favoured with ability in measure to perform.</P>
<P>He still continued in profession with the presbyterians, not having any knowledge of friends; although by attending to the teach∣ings of divine grace, he became convinced of the principle we profess; and hearing of a yearly-meeting of friends to be held on Long-Island, went to it, with desires to dis∣cover whether they were a living people or not, for such he desired to find; where he met with what he often longed for, (a peo∣ple that worshipped God in spirit and in truth) which was a great strength and con∣firmation to him, in forsaking the errors of his youth, and by yielding obedience to these inward motions, he gained strength, and was more and more enabled to bear a faithful testimony to the truth as it was made known to him.</P>
<P>In the sixth month 1733, he removed to Philadelphia, where he joined in religious fellowship with friends; in 1735 he married Mary the daughter of Samuel and Sarah Massey; and in 1737 removed to Wilming∣ton in New-Castle county, where he resided the remainder of his days.</P>
<P><PB N="392" REF="020377_0399_0FAF05AEB2E04EA8"/>He made some appearance in the ministry about the year 1734, but through unfaith∣fulness to the divine call, he from time to time put it off, and remained in a neglect of duty therein upwards of twenty years; altho' he was often warned both immediate∣ly and instrumentally in a remarkable man∣ner, which at length produced a submission to the divine will, so that in the year 1755, he was made willing to give up thereto, and therein found great peace.</P>
<P>He travelled thro' divers parts of this continent in the work of the ministry, and by certificates produced on his return home, it appeared, that his conduct, conversation, and labours abroad were exemplary and edifying, tending to the advancement of truth and righteousness. His doctrine was sound, and acceptable to the honest hearted, tho' sharp against the hypocrite and rebel∣lious, yet tender to the mourners and dis∣consolate.</P>
<P>He was very serviceable in our meetings for discipline, which, with other meetings, he diligently attended, not suffering his out∣ward affairs to hinder him from what he be∣lieved to be his religious duty. And altho' he followed shop-keeping for a living, it was his practice to shut up his shop and take his family with him to week day meetings, often expressing for the encouragement of others, that he believed it was attended with a blessing. He was free and open hearted to entertain friends, and concerned to bring
<PB N="393" REF="020377_0400_0FAF05AF78BDE8D0"/>
up his children in plainness, and instruct them in the fear of the word, believing that to be the best portion they could inherit; remarkably charitable to the poor, and of∣ten administred to their necessities.</P>
<P>Bodily weakness attended him during the last three years of his life, and near the close of his days, he was much afflicted with sickness, which he bore with patience, often expressing his prospect of his approaching end, and his resignation therein; saying, 'All is well.' Several friends being present, after a time of silence, he in a lively manner repeated the expressions of the apostle,
<Q>To me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.</Q></P>
<P>He departed this life, the 5<HI>th</HI> of the twelfth month 1779, aged upwards of se∣venty-two, a minister about 24 years; on the 7<HI>th</HI> of the same month, his corps was interr'd in our burying-ground in Wilming∣ton.</P>

<P>HE was born in the Township of Edge∣mont, in Chester county Pennsylvania, the 27<HI>th</HI> of the twelfth month 1707-8, and continued a member of this monthly-meet∣ing to his end. In the days of his youth he had a strong bias to the diversions of the
<PB N="394" REF="020377_0401_0FAF05B087C53260"/>
times, which when given way to, he felt the secret reproofs of divine grace accom∣panied with great fervency of spirit, to wit∣ness forgiveness through Christ Jesus, by the operation of whose spirit, he obtained so great a victory, that he was (after a season of probation) entrusted with a dispensation of the gospel ministry, in the exercise of which, his doctrine was sharp against a state of lukewarmness about religion as well as open profaneness, seasonably instructive to the sincere seekers, exhorting them not to be satisfied short of witnessing a state of re∣generation. He was often led to sympathize with the afflicted in spirit, unto whom his doctrine dropt as the dew, and was by ma∣ny esteemed a nursing father in the meeting to which he belonged. He several times, with the concurrence of his friends, visited the churches in this and the adjacent go∣vernments; was zealously concerned that meetings for discipline might be maintained in the same authority wherein they were first established; and divers times was en∣gaged in visiting families, for which weigh∣ty service he was well qualified. His con∣cern for his children was great, which at times he expressed under the power of di∣vine love, adopting the language of David, viz.
<Q>My children, know ye the God of your fathers, and serve him with a per∣fect heart and willing mind; if ye seek him, he will be found of you, but if ye forsake him, he will cast you off forever.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="395" REF="020377_0402_0FAF05B3CEE9BFC0"/>For several years of the latter part of his life, he was afflicted with weakness of body, but not so as wholly to prevent his attending meetings, in which he was at times, power∣fully drawn forth in testimony, and public∣ly expressed at Middletown a few weeks be∣fore his confinement, an apprehension that his work was nearly over. He was confined at home near three months, in which time he was visited by many friends, often had refreshing opportunities in his room; in one of which, (being about a week after his confinement) he was led to speak of the precious effects of unity; at another time, divers friends being present, after some si∣lence, he expressed himself on this wise,
<Q>How many opportunities of this sort I may yet have is unknown to me; this morning as I lay in bed, meditating on the things of God, it appeared to me as tho' my time in this world would be but short;</Q>
earnestly exhorting those present, to labour that they and their children might be prepared to meet with death. At several times he signified,
<Q>He was like one that was waiting for his change,</Q>
expressing his resignation, and said,
<Q>Whenever he turn∣ed his mind inward he felt great peace, and that the thoughts of the grave was no terror to him.</Q>
He graduall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> weaken∣ed without much pain, till about two days before his departure, and continued sensible to the last, which was on the 10<HI>th</HI> day of the first month 1780, and on the 13<HI>th</HI> his

<HEAD>A Testimony from <HI>Nottingham</HI> Monthly-Meeting in <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> concerning <HI>RACHEL BROWN.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SHE was the wife of Thomas Brown, of West-Nottingham, in Chester county Pennsylvania, and daughter of Ralph and Phebe Needham, of Kent county on Dela∣ware, educated amongst friends, shewing in her younger years an inclination towards piety, and after her marriage was concerned at times to speak in testimony in our religi∣ous meetings, and tho' not large, yet fre∣quently, especially in the latter part of her time, her appearances were attended with a lively favour, which, with her exemplary conduct, and zeal for the attendance of our meetings for public worship and maintain∣ing good order in the church, rendered her services useful and acceptable among us; and towards the conclusion of her life, she appeared to be favoured with an increase of solidity and weight.</P>
<P>In her last illness which continued about three weeks, we believe she was much bless∣ed with the incomes of divine love, uttering many weighty expressions, some of which
<PB N="397" REF="020377_0404_0FAF05B66E082E00"/>
being wrote down, are in substance as fol∣lows;
<Q>Oh! that I had but power to ex∣press the love I feel to flow towards the church, and those who are really joined thereto. Oh! the wonderful love of the father which I feel to flow even to the out∣casts of the house of Israel.</Q>
At another time,
<Q>Oh! the straitness and refinedness of the path that leads to life and happiness,</Q>
repeating her sense of the wonderful love of our Lord Jesus Christ to his church, which seemed then remarkably opened to her, in an explanation of those expressions in the eighth verse of the fourth chapter of Solo∣mon's Song,
<Q>Come with me from Leba∣non, my spouse, with me from Lebanon; look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the Lions dens, from the mountains of the Leopards;</Q>
the mystery of which invita∣tion, we understand she spoke of at divers times in her sickness in a lively manner, as it appeared to her applicable to the divine call of our Saviour to his followers, to come out of all high things, and for his sake who was plain, meek and lowly, to leave or forsake the loftiness and grandeur of this world, things desirable to the proud fleshly part in us, to cease also from spotted things, and those of a fierce devouring nature: And, as her last testimony against the superfluity crept in among friends in relation to coffins and dressing the bodies of the dead, she
<PB N="398" REF="020377_0405_0FAF05B7080832B8"/>
earnestly desired that her coffin might be quite plain, and that no needless things might be put on or about her.</P>
<P>She desired her love to her friends, saying,
<Q>I have frequently desired your prayers for me, that I might have an easy passage, and now I am resigned, and desire to have no will of my own, but to wait with pa∣tience the Lord's time, and also for his salvation.</Q>
Remaining sensible after her speech failed, she quietly departed this life, the 11<HI>th</HI> of the fifth month 1780, in the fifty-third year of her age, and was interr'd in friends burying-ground at East-Notting∣ham on the 13<HI>th</HI> of the same month.</P>

<P>OUR said friend was born the 29<HI>th</HI> day of the eighth month 1695, and his parents settling somewhat remote from the then settlement of white inhabitants, it ap∣pears by a manuscript account he has left, that he used to walk on foot about ten miles to meeting, and being faithful to the mani∣festations of truth in his young years, was enabled to encourage his brothers to go with him to wait upon the Lord.</P>
<P>He makes mention of divers besetments and exercises he met with in his spiritual
<PB N="399" REF="020377_0406_0FAF05B7C598FFA8"/>
journey, but by waiting in stillness upon the Lord, he was pleased to appear for his help; and he was often drawn to retire in the woods and solitary places, when his mind was at times enlarged in prayer for himself and mankind universally.</P>
<P>He was a diligent attender of religious meetings whilst of ability of body, seldom suffering the extremity of weather or his temporal concerns to prevent him from the discharge of his duty in this respect, altho' he lived at a considerable distance from the particular meeting to which he belonged, and was an exemplary humble waiter there∣in, for the arising of that life which is the crown of our assemblies.</P>
<P>He was an appointed elder for the meet∣ing at Haddonfield, and conducted upright∣ly in his station, which rendered him ac∣ceptable to his friends, being often employed in the affairs of truth; and was several times engaged in that weighty service of visiting families, in the performance whereof, he was sometimes fervently and awfully drawn forth in supplication to the father of mercies.</P>
<P>He was just in his dealings among men, remarkably cautious in expression, which, joined with a meek and pious life, rendered him a pattern among his fellow-believers worthy of imitation; and his light so shined forth before men, that others seeing his good works, were made to acknowledge he had attained the marks of a true disciple and believer in Christ.</P>

<P>BY accounts we have had, she was born at Grange, in the county of Antrim, in the North of Ireland, the 10<HI>th</HI> of the first month (old stile) 1719-20, descended of re∣ligious parents professing the truth (John and Margaret Hudson.) Her father dying in low circumstances when she was young, she was placed out by her mother to earn her living by her own labour; who never∣theless sought a portion in the truth for her daughter, esteeming it the best riches; and lived to see the desire of her heart in that respect in a degree accomplished; for the tendering visitations of divine love being mercifully extended to this our dear friend
<PB N="401" REF="020377_0408_0FAF05B940C69BC0"/>
early in life, she happily closed in therewith, and witnessed an advancement in piety and godliness; such was her love to the truth and zeal for the attendance of meetings when young, she would go many miles on foot to them, and being an honest servant, laboured hard to make up the time to her employer. In these times, her cup was of∣ten made to overflow with the goodness of the Lord to her soul, which she has fre∣quently been heard to speak of with tender∣ness of spirit, for the encouragement of ser∣vants and others in low circumstances; and that the rich and full who have horses to ride on, and are blessed both with the ne∣cessaries and conveniences of life, might prize their time and privileges, and bring forth fruits adequate to the favours confer∣red on them.</P>
<P>A dispensation of the gospel was commit∣ted to her to preach, to which she gave up in the seventeenth year of her age; and we have reason to think, she grew therein as a willow by the water course; for in the ex∣ercise thereof, with the unity of her friends at home, she came over to this country with Ruth Courtny, in the latter part of the year 1737, and paid a religious visit to friends generally on this continent, we believe to good satisfaction; some of us having cause to remember her, and the sweetness of her spirit at that time. With the same friend she also travelled in England and Wales, in
<PB N="402" REF="020377_0409_0FAF05BA80D132B0"/>
1740, spending upwards of fifteen months there in the service of truth.</P>
<P>On the 25<HI>th</HI> of the ninth month 1742, she was married to Jesse Hatton; in which state, she for many years, underwent great outward difficulties, as well as inward exer∣cises and trials on account of the cause and testimony of truth which she had espoused, and was favoured with firmness to hold her integrity thereto; which she has been heard to commemorate with thankfulness to the Lord her deliverer, rendering the praise to him alone, who, even during that trying dispensation, opened her way to labour con∣siderably in his cause in many places, as in Ireland, Scotland, and again in England.</P>
<P>About the year 1754, she removed with her husband and family, and settled in Wa∣terford, where she was made truly near to friends and useful in the Lord's hand.</P>
<P>In the year 1759 her husband died; and in 1760, being constrained by the love of truth, and having the concurrence of her friends at home and of the meeting of mi∣nisters and elders in London, she entered on a second visit to America, which for many years had rested weightily on her mind. In the ninth month of the same year she ar∣rived here, and visited friends meetings ge∣generally throughout this continent, as far southward as Charleston, in South-Caro∣lina, and to the eastern parts of New-En∣gland, to the comfort and satisfaction of friends, leaving seals of her ministry in
<PB N="403" REF="020377_0410_0FAF05BAB51F7108"/>
many places; and after a labour of upwards of two years, embarked for England. In the summer following she visited Munster province in Ireland. And on the 25<HI>th</HI> of the ninth month 1763, she was married to our friend Thomas Lightfoot; and continu∣ing servent in spirit for the discharge of her religious duties, finished her visit to that nation by midsummer following.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the eighth month 1764, she embarked at Cork with her hus∣band and family in order to settle here, and arrived in the ninth month following, from which time she belonged to our monthly-meeting, whereof she was a serviceable mem∣ber; likewise was engaged in the love of the gospel, to visit many of the meetings of friends in this and the adjacent governments, also the neighbouring yearly-meetings, and in the year 1774, went into New-England, with our friend Elizabeth Robinson from Great-Britain; in which visits her company and services were weighty, strengthening and establishing to friends.</P>
<P>At divers meetings previous to the break∣ing forth of the present calamity, she had, in an awful manner, to proclaim the ap∣proach of a stormy day, which would shake the sandy foundations of men; and many of the formal professors in our society should be blown away.</P>
<P>The last journey she took, was to the year∣ly-meeting at Third-Haven, in Maryland, held in the sixth month 1779, wherein deep
<PB N="404" REF="020377_0411_0FAF05BB8F12B038"/>
wading and wasting exercise, with feeble∣ness of body was her lot. Soon after her return home, a fit of illness contributed much to the breaking of her constitution; but the balm of sweet peace of mind was still her comfort and support. She recover∣ed so as to get abroad again to her own and many other meetings about the country, and to our last yearly-meeting in Philadel∣phia, tho' in a weak state of health; the last she attended was our select meeting at Uwchlan, the 27<HI>th</HI> of the first month 1781, under an increasing weakness of body, but to the comfort of friends then assembled.</P>
<P>She was an excellent example of steady waiting upon the Lord in silence, and out of meetings solid and grave in her deport∣ment, instructive and weighty in conversa∣tion, watchful over her own family for their good, bearing her testimony against wrong things in them as well as others; of a dis∣cerning spirit; and when her lot was cast in families as well as meetings, was often led to feel for and sympathize with the hidden suffering seed. Having passed through the deep waters of affliction herself, her eye was not unused to drop a tear for, and with others in distress either in body or mind, and she rejoiced in comforting and doing them good.</P>
<P>She was a living and powerful minister of the word, careful not to break silence in meetings, until favoured with a fresh anoint∣ing from the holy one, whereby she was
<PB N="405" REF="020377_0412_0FAF05BC4A028000"/>
preserved clear in her openings, awful and weighty in prayer, her voice being solemn and awakening under the baptizing power of truth.</P>
<P>Many were the heavenly seasons with which she was favoured during a lingering illness, in some of which she was led to ex∣press herself in a lively edifying manner, and often, with divine pertinence to the states of those who were present; as also her belief that she should join the spirits of the just made perfect, in that city whose walls are salvation, and her gates praise.</P>
<P>One evening, after a solemn silence, she broke forth in a sweet melody, saying,
<Q>I have had a prospect this evening, of join∣ing the heavenly host, in singing praises to Zions king, for which favour my soul and all that is sensible within me, magni∣fies that arm which hath been with me from my infant days, and cast up a way where there was no way, both by sea and land.</Q>
She then signified what an exercise she had laboured under for the good of souls, and how it wounded her very life, to behold the professors of christianity acting incon∣sistent with the example of a crucified Sa∣viour.</P>
<P>She frequently supplicated the Lord for the continuance of his help, and that she might be endued with patience, adding,
<Q>Oh! what would become of me now, if I had a wounded conscience? The work with me is not now to do: This winnow∣ing
<PB N="406" REF="020377_0413_0FAF05BCF201DD58"/>
day must come closer to the dwellings of some than ever it has done, even to the shaking of them from the gods of silver and of gold, hay or stubble.</Q></P>
<P>The quarterly-meeting being nigh, she urged her husband to leave her, saying,
<Q>There is nothing yields such comfort on a languishing bed as an evidence of hav∣ing performed our religious duties to the best of our understanding, I can speak it at this time by experience.</Q>
She spoke of the necessity there was for friends to guard against keeping in their families persons of corrupt morals and evil communication, which hath a tendency to poison the tender minds of their children; and signified her apprehension, that some parents were stain∣ed with the blood of their offspring there∣by. At another time, she encouraged some that were present, to be faithful to the Lord, and to keep to their gifts, adding,
<Q>Oh! what a fine thing it is to sit lively in meet∣ings, and to witness the holy oil to run as from vessel to vessel.</Q>
Feeling herself grow worse, she gave directions about the laying-out her body, that it should be with exem∣plary plainness.</P>
<P>One morning, in the hearing of a few friends, she cautioned against a light chaffy spirit getting up in a shew of religion, and was led in a remarkable manner, to utter reproofs against the ungodly Quaker, signi∣fying a terrible day would sooner or later overtake such.</P>
<P><PB N="407" REF="020377_0414_0FAF05BDCC0D9A10"/>She expressed herself one day nearly as follows,
<Q>When I have sat down in our meetings, and cast my eye over the peo∣ple, how have I been grieved to see the haughtiness of the young men, and the folly of the young women, looking one upon another, as if there was nothing to do; coming to meetings just to see and be seen: Oh! will not the Lord visit for these things? Yea, surely he will, and call to an account those haughty sons and for∣getful daughters; I have been grieved with it when I have sat as with my lips sealed; and yet there is a remnant that are near to my life among the youth.</Q></P>
<P>At another time, being raised by divine aid from great weakness, she thus expressed herself,
<Q>The Lord will search Jerusalem, he will blow away the chaff; but the wheat, Oh! the weighty wheat he will gather into his holy garner.
It seems to
me, that many of the better sort are hast∣ening to their graves. I do not repine at my afflictions, for how small are they, compared with his who suffered for us all, when he said, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" Oh the professors of truth! How often have I thought of their great privileges! How often have they been called unto and watered! And yet remain unredeemed; there is much impurity about the skirts of some; if they refuse they will be rejected and others called in; he will have his table filled, he
<PB N="408" REF="020377_0415_0FAF05BE70D098E8"/>
will have a people that will stand for his name.</Q>
After sometime, asking for a friend, she said,
<Q>I have something to say to thee about the city; the folly, I would not willingly call it iniquity, but upon a strict examination I believe it may be so called, of laying out their dead, has been a burden to me many times of late when I have been there, I have wondered at the pomp and vanity, and the cost, how much for no good purpose at all, but to be buri∣ed with the mouldering body. How much better it would be, to spare this expence for the benefit of some poor families? I did not know but I should have mention∣ed it at the yearly-meeting, but I got en∣feebled, and I prayed it might rest on some others, that it might be done then or at some other time.</Q></P>
<P>In the afternoon of the same day, she mentioned some of the words of Amos,
<Q>I was no prophet, nor a prophet's son, but I was a gatherer of sycamore fruit;</Q>
<Q>low employments, said she,
<Q>But the Lord raiseth the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill to set them among princes.</Q>
I have been one of sorrows, and much acquainted with grief. It is true, this has been a pleasant spot to live in, and with an agreeable companion, and it was nothing short of the good hand that thus provided for me, but I have never forgot the wormwood and the gall.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="409" REF="020377_0416_0FAF05C1E2EA8D88"/>She continued quiet and sensible the re∣mainder of her time, saying,
<Q>Oh dearest Lord! take me to thyself, even into thy heavenly kingdom; take me into Paradise, for I long to be with thee there.</Q>
After expressing the desire of her soul respecting one of her sons, she took leave of her hus∣band and others present with a look of en∣dearing love, and expired about the fourth hour in the morning, like one falling into an easy slumber, on the 8<HI>th</HI> of the fifth month 1781, and was interr'd the 11<HI>th</HI> at Uwchlan, attended by a very great con∣course of people; on which occasion a meet∣ing was held, and was indeed a good meet∣ing, agreeable to a prospect she had in the early part of her illness; aged sixty-one, and a minister 44 years.</P>

<HEAD>A Testimony from <HI>Evesham</HI> Monthly-Meeting in <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> concerning <HI>THOMAS EVANS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HE was born the 12<HI>th</HI> day of the second month 1693, and descended from pa∣rents professing the truth, whose religious care over him, co-operating with the prin∣ciple of divine grace implanted in his mind, was the happy means of fixing his attention, not on a corruptible inheritance, but on that which is incorruptible, eternal in the hea∣vens, and fadeth not away. And as he was in a good degree faithful to the manifestati∣on
<PB N="410" REF="020377_0417_0FAF05C2D0CCE358"/>
of light afforded him, about the twenty-fifth year of his age, he entered on the work of the ministry, in which he diligently la∣boured, visiting, with the concurrence of his friends, divers parts of this continent. He was often led sensibly to declare of the love and goodness of the Lord to those who diligently wait upon and seek him; and is worthy of remembrance for his steady ex∣ample in the attendance of meetings.</P>
<P>In his advanced years, he had divers pain∣ful times of illness, but was admirably pre∣served through them without the help of medicine. He was temperate in his living; and that innocency of life, meekness and love which attended him in his early years, shined clear in his latter days, being often favoured (when his understanding in world∣ly matters appeared to fail him) in a lively manner to speak to the states of the people when religiously assembled, which made him near to many friends. He was a peace∣maker amongst his neighbours and friends, and earnestly engaged for the universal ad∣vancement of true peace amongst mankind; bearing a faithful testimony against war, and against the unnecessary distillation and use of spirituous liquors, and the prevail∣ing and foolish customs and fashions of the world.</P>
<P>In his last illness, he was preserved in great patience and resignation through much bodily pain, signifying his
<Q>Satisfaction in having discharged his religious duty; and
<PB N="411" REF="020377_0418_0FAF05C45BFD8700"/>
that all looked pleasant before him, and nothing remained for him to do, unless the Lord should again please to raise him, which was hid from his sight, but that he was quite resigned to his will in all things.</Q></P>
<P>In these trying hours, wherein he was enabled to drop many comfortable and edi∣fying sentences to those who visited him, he appeared to be favoured with a foretaste of that true peace which is laid up in store for all them who hold out to the end in well-doing.</P>
<P>He departed this life, the 21<HI>st</HI> of the first month 1783, and was interr'd at Evesham on the 24<HI>th,</HI> aged near ninety, and a mini∣ster about 65 years.</P>

<P>ON this occasion, we may pertinently adopt the lamenting address of the disciples at Joppa, to the apostle Peter, on the death of Dorcas their sister, who had been
<Q>Full of good works, and alms deeds which she had done. And all the widows stood by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas had made while she was with them.</Q>
Acts ix. 37.39.</P>
<P><PB N="412" REF="020377_0419_0FAF05C47981E0C8"/>He was born in France, at a town named St. Quintin, in the province of Picardy, on the 31<HI>st</HI> of that now called the first month, 1713. At which time romish bigotry and superstition subjected the protestants in that kingdom to very rigorous persecutions, which occasioned many thousands of them to leave it, among whom were the parents of our deceased friend, who removed from thence on the 3<HI>d</HI> of the second month called February, 1715, and after spending a few months in Holland, proceeded to London, where they resided about sixteen years, and in the month called November, 1731, they arrived in this city, being well recommend∣ed by divers friends.</P>
<P>In the fifth month, 1736, he was married to our friend Joyce Marriott, of this city, in whom he experienced a truly religious help-meet, almost to the end of forty-eight years. Being dissatisfied with following mercantile business, to which he was brought up, he declined that occupation and sought other employments for the maintenance of his family, and they also engaging more of his time and attention than he found consistent with his peace of mind, he willingly em∣braced an opportunity which offered favour∣able to his inclination and concern for the instruction of youth in useful learning, by supplying a vacancy which happened in the year 1742 in the English-school under the direction of friends in this city; which by their encouragement he undertook, and con∣tinued
<PB N="413" REF="020377_0420_0FAF05C5398D6600"/>
in this employment through the re∣maining part of his life, except a small in∣termission of less than two years which he spent at Burlington, where he sought for greater retirement, and more leisure to at∣tend to his religious concern for the general good of mankind: But did not find his mind at the ease he desired, until he return∣ed to resume his employment of school-keeping in this city▪ where he experienced greater opportunity of extensive usefulness, in which he was assiduously diligent, suf∣fering a small portion of natural rest to sa∣tisfy him; employing his pen day and night in the compilation of books and other writ∣ings for profitable instruction on religious subjects, chiefly extracted from various au∣thors of eminence, particularly to inculcate the peaceable temper and doctrines of the gospel, in opposition to the spirit of war and bloodshed, as also to expose the flagrant in∣justice of slavery and the abomination of the African-trade; lamenting the sorrowful defection of professed christians in these re∣spects, which deeply grieved his tender heart. The distribution of his labours have been found productive of much good, to render which more extensive, he held a cor∣respondence with such persons in various parts of Europe and America, as united with him in the like concern, or were so circumstanced as to be likely to promote his pious well-meant views.</P>
<P><PB N="414" REF="020377_0421_0FAF05C607FAA9E0"/>On the late cessation of war between Great-Britain and America, apprehending the revival of commerce would be likely to renew the ignominious trade to Africa for slaves, which had been in some measure ob∣structed, among other endeavours to disuade from this cruel traffic, and having enter∣tained a favourable opinion of the dispo∣sition and sentiments of the queen of Great-Britain, hoping her influence might be useful to discourage it, he was religiously induced to transmit her a letter in 1783 on the subject, with a present of a few books of a pious tendency, which he committed to the care of two of his friends in London, to deliver in such manner as they should judge to be most suitable; this service being performed soon after his decease; one of them, by a letter received within a few days past, informs his friend here, that the letter from him with the books, had been deliver∣ed to the queen, who on her reading it, ex∣pressed her persuasion,
<Q>That the writer was truly a good man, and that she kind∣ly accepted his present,</Q>
engaging also to read the books.</P>
<P><HI>(A copy of the letter is hereunto annexed.)</HI></P>
<P>He was employed the two last years of his life, as teacher in the school for the in∣struction of the black-people and their off∣spring, established and supported by the voluntary contributions of friends in this city, which by the indisposition of the form∣er
<PB N="415" REF="020377_0422_0FAF05C6C144DC10"/>
teacher, had lain sometime vacant, un∣dertaking this employment from an appre∣hension of religious duty, and an earnest solicitude that they might be better qualifi∣ed rightly to enjoy the freedom to which great numbers of them had been of late re∣stored; for which purpose he surrendered, with the consent of his friends, his other school, though to the manifest disadvantage of his worldly interest.</P>
<P>His confinement by his last illness was not of long continuance, although he had not been in perfect health for more than a year before, but being of a lively disposition, and remarkably temperate in his food, which was principally vegetables, he attended his school and other affairs until the increase of his disorder disabled him.</P>
<P>He endured the bodily pains he suffered with much patience, and was favoured with great calmness and composure, being sensi∣ble of his approaching dissolution, receiv∣ing his numerous visitors with much kind∣ness, but expressed little to any of them con∣cerning himself, abiding under that humble diffidence which was conspicuous in his con∣duct through life, considering himself but as an unprofitable servant. A short time before his confinement, in a familiar con∣versation, he took occasion to remark, that had he attended with due care to the pros∣pects of duty given <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in his younger years, he thought it was probable he might
<PB N="416" REF="020377_0423_0FAF05C793734750"/>
have been made instrumental for more ex∣tensive usefulness to mankind.</P>
<P>On the day preceeding his death he took an affecting farewell of his wife, who was then also in a weak infirm state, when he reminded her of the affection and concord which had been maintained between them through the course of their union; and having sometime before reviewed and exe∣cuted his will, in which he had devised his whole estate to her during her natural life, (excepting his small library and other books) and on her decease to certain trustees, the income thereof to be applied to the use and support of the Negro-school. He had in the time of his illness added a codicil, confirm∣ing the same, with a reservation of some small legacies to a few of his relations, in∣digent widows, and other poor persons; and having copies transcribed, with instructions for the distribution of the books he had on hand, and for binding divers tracts on re∣ligious subjects which remained in sheets, he delivered them to some of his executors for their government; the last of which he put into the hands of one of them not more than three hours before he departed, which was about sun-set on the 3<HI>d</HI> day of the fifth month 1784, being the day of our quarter∣ly-meeting; and on the 5<HI>th</HI> day of the same he was buried in our grave-yard in this ci∣ty; on which solemn occasion, a great concourse of inhabitants of all ranks and professions attended, manifesting the uni∣versal
<PB N="417" REF="020377_0424_0FAF05C8551819C8"/>
esteem in which he was held, among whom also several hundred black-people in like manner testified the grateful sense they had of the benefits derived to them, through his acts of friendship and pious labours on their behalf.</P>
<P>Unwearied in his endeavours to promote the essential interest and well-being of men, it seemed as his 'Meat and drink' to tread the path of his divine master, in
<Q>Going about, doing good.</Q>
His labours for the relief of the afflicted and oppressed, particu∣larly that much injured people, the enslaved Africans and their descendants, having been unabated and successful, beyond almost any advocate they have had in his time, devo∣ting no small portion of his life and worldly substance, in vindication of their violated rights as men, and their instruction in things relating to their temporal and everlasting interest.</P>
<P>By an innocent unreserved affability, he gained esteem and acceptance among all classes of men; that love of his neighbour which was conspicuous throughout his com∣munication, having a softening effect, even on rough untractable spirits, and so general∣ly did his useful life and inoffensive de∣meanour engage the affections and regard of all ranks of the people among whom he dwelt, that at his decease, they seemed to unite in one common sentiment and declara∣tion, of
<Q>Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="418" REF="020377_0425_0FAF05C94B29DD48"/>He wanted neither abilities nor opportu∣nity for using endeavours in the acquire∣ment of wealth; but his moderation in this as in other respects, was uniformly manifest to all observers; being with little more than a bare competency, rich and liberal beyond most of those who are encumbered with the superabundant goods of this life.</P>
<P>This is a summary narrative of the useful life of our valuable friend, and as we mean not to extol the instrument, but to render to the Lord our creator the praise of his own works; let this account suffice, and ex∣cite in each mind a due observance of that gospel monition,
<Q>Go and do thou like∣wise.</Q></P>
<P>The following is a copy of his letter to the queen, mentioned in the foregoing tes∣timony, viz.
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>To</HI> CHARLOTTE, <HI>Queen of Great-Britain.</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IMPRESSED with a sense of religious duty, and encouraged by the opinion gene∣rally entertained of thy benevolent dispositi∣on to succour the distressed, I take the liber∣ty, very respectfully, to offer to thy perusal some tracts which I believe faithfully de∣scribe the suffering condition of many hun∣dred thousands of our fellow creatures of the African race, great numbers of whom, rent from every tender connection in life, are annually taken from their native land, to endure in the American islands and plan∣tations,
<PB N="419" REF="020377_0426_0FAF05C9D1C506C8"/>
a most rigorous and cruel slavery, whereby many, very many of them, are brought to a melancholy and untimely end.</P>
<P>When it is considered, that the inhabi∣tants of Britain, who are themselves so emi∣nently blessed in the enjoyment of religious and civil liberty, have long been, and yet are, very deeply concerned in this flagrant violation of the common rights of mankind, and that even its national authority is ex∣erted in support of the African slave-trade, there is much reason to apprehend, that this has been, and as long as the evil exists will continue to be, an occasion of drawing down the divine displeasure on the nation and its dependencies. May these considerations in∣duce thee to interpose thy kind endeavours on behalf of this greatly oppressed people, whose abject situation gives them an additi∣onal claim to the pity and assistance of the generous mind; inasmuch as they are alto∣gether deprived of the means of soliciting effectual relief for themselves. That so thou may not only be a blessed instrument in the hand of him
<Q>By whom kings reign, and princes decree justice,</Q>
to avert the awful judgments by which the empire has already been so remarkably shaken, but that the blessings of thousands ready to perish, may come upon thee, at a time when the superior advantages attendant on thy situation in this world, will no longer be of any avail to thy consolation and support.</P>
<P><PB N="420" REF="020377_0427_0FAF05CA82ED34E0"/>To the tracts on the subject to which I have thus ventured to crave thy particular attention, I have added some others, which at different times, I have believed it my du∣ty to publish, and which I trust will afford thee some satisfaction; their design being for the furtherance of that universal peace and good-will amongst men, which the gospel was intended to introduce.</P>
<P>I hope thou will kindly excuse the free∣dom used on this occasion, by an ancient man, whose mind for more than forty years past, has been much separated from the common course of the world, and long pain∣fully exercised in the consideration of the miseries under which so large a part of man∣kind equally with us the objects of redeem∣ing love, are suffering the most unjust and grievous oppression, and who sincerely de∣sires the temporal and eternal felicity of the queen and her royal consort.</P>

<HEAD>A Testimony from <HI>Concord</HI> Monthly-Meeting in <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> concerning <HI>PHEBE TRIMBLE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE memory of the just is pronounced "Blessed;" which we wish to be verifi∣ed in the following memorial of this our
<PB N="421" REF="020377_0428_0FAF05CB99C19508"/>
esteemed friend, by affording an excitement to survivors to walk in her steps.</P>
<P>The days of her youth and early periods of maturer age, were attended with close trials, stripping seasons, and deep baptisms, through all which the Lord her gracious helper (whose tender regard is ever manifest∣ed towards his humble depending children) preserved her, and raised her up to be a vessel in his house. About the forty-second year of her age, being in 1759, she settled with her husband William Trimble within the limits of this meeting, to which she was recommended by certificate from Goshen monthly-meeting, as an approved minister, which character she justly retained during her stay in mutability.</P>
<P>Her public appearances, tho' generally in few words, were truly acceptable and edify∣ing, being clear, pertinent, comprehensive and savoury, and accompanied with deep humility and gravity of deportment. She was not forward in the exercise of her gift, but appeared desirous to proceed therein under divine direction. At two different times she visited friends in Maryland and Virginia, and once in North and South-Carolina, in which visits her gospel labours were well received.</P>
<P>Her common deportment was instructive; evidencing lowliness, meekness and self-de∣nial; that it may just be said, her
<Q>Adorn∣ing was that of a meek and quiet spirit.</Q>
Her conversation, tho' pleasant and cheer∣ful, was accompanied with that sweetness
<PB N="422" REF="020377_0429_0FAF05CC33EB4668"/>
and gravity which rendered it both agreea∣ble and profitable. Her heart and house were open to the reception and entertain∣ment of her friends; nor was her benevo∣lence and humane feelings circumscribed to those in religious communion with her; but the poor, we believe, of all denominations in the neighbourhood where she lived, par∣took of her kindness, and by her removal have lost a sympathizing friend.</P>
<P>During the time of her last illness, she was much given to stillness and retiredness of mind, being sometimes uneasy with friends conversing on temporal subjects in her presence. Her hope and faith in her dear redeemer, we believe did not fail her in this her last and trying period; though she was very lowly and humble in her own estimation, and at times almost diffident of her being worthy of divine regard: Thus in her case may be applicably revived, the an∣cient interrogation,
<Q>If the righteous scarce∣ly be saved, where shall the ungodly and sinner appear?</Q>
May this awaken profita∣ble reflections in the minds of all, especially the careless and indifferent.</P>
<P>On the 14<HI>th</HI> of the sixth month 1784, she quietly departed this life, in the sixty-seventh year of her age; and on the 16<HI>th</HI> was buri∣ed at Concord, attended by many friends and others, at which time was held a large and solemn meeting. And we doubt not but she is gone from works to an happy reward.</P>

<HEAD>A Testimony from the Monthly-Meeting of Friends of <HI>Philadelphia</HI> for the <HI>Southern-District,</HI> concerning <HI>JOHN REYNELL.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THOUGH none of us were acquainted with him whilst he resided in Great-Britain, the land of his nativity, yet we have cause to believe, from what himself has ex∣pressed, that he was early visited with the offers of divine love, and by wisely closing in therewith, he came to experience preser∣vation from many temptations and allure∣ments wherewith the minds of unwary youth are liable to be ensnared.</P>
<P>To several of his particular friends, he, at times, mentioned some transactions pre∣vious to his coming to this country, which containing matter of encouragement to faithfulness in others, we apprehend may not improperly be here inserted, viz.</P>
<P>When about eighteen years of age, pur∣posing to embark on a voyage to Jamaica, and being thoughtful lest he might lay down the body at that place, as had been the case with many, he received, as he believed, a divine assurance that his life should be pre∣served. During his residence there, he had a sight given him, of a grievous calamity by means of a violent hurricane, to befall the inhabitants of the Island as a chastise∣ment for their iniquities, which came to pass according to his prospect. Soon after∣wards an occurrence happening which oc∣casioned
<PB N="424" REF="020377_0431_0FAF05D0F5D1A620"/>
his being called upon to give evi∣dence in a court of judicature, he was re∣quired to take an oath, which he conscienti∣ously refusing, it proved for a time, no small trial of his faithfulness; and although he had few or none outwardly to look to for strength and encouragement under that ex∣ercise, he was nevertheless favoured to ex∣perience divine support to be near, so that neither threatning nor persuasion could pre∣vail on him to deviate from our christian testimony in that respect. Very few of the members of our religious society then resided on that Island, yet a meeting-house belong∣ing to friends still remaining in Kingston, he was not easy to omit attending at the times appointed for meeting, though he sometimes sat alone therein.</P>
<P>About the twentieth year of his age he came to Pennsylvania, and after settling in this city, he became a serviceable member among us both in a religious and civil capaci∣ty, cheerfully employing his talents and much of his time to beneficial and laudable purposes, and was often engaged as a peace∣maker in reconciling differences.</P>
<P>As an elder, he approved himself in faith∣fulness and uprightness in the discharge of that important trust, being well qualified for the station he filled. A good example in diligently attending our religious meetings as long as ability of body permitted, and very useful in the exercise of the discipline. A man of integrity and sound judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="425" REF="020377_0432_0FAF05D1EF23CB78"/>Being favoured with an affluence of tem∣poral riches, he endeavoured to fulfil his duty as a good steward, by liberally com∣municating of his substance to such as stood in need. Besides his repeated acts of liberali∣ty throughout the course of his life, the many charitable legacies he bequeathed by his will, are further proofs of his benevo∣lent disposition. So that we believe it may justly be said, he was one that
<Q>Feared God and hated covetousness.</Q></P>
<P>In the spring of the year 1784, his natu∣ral strength evidently impairing, he beheld the prospect of his approaching dissolution with the serenity and composure of a chris∣tian; and continued gradually declining for several months, during which time he did not impart much respecting his own spiritual state, being desirous to be more in substance than shew, yet found it needful to keep up a steady watch until his warfare should be accomplished. Two friends visiting him one evening, he mentioned,
<Q>That on look∣ing over his past life, he was sensible of many deficiencies,</Q>
yet expressed
<Q>A hope that all would be well.</Q>
On the evening previous to his departure, he said,
<Q>I am ready. I feel myself happy, and surround∣ed with divine glory;</Q>
and expired the 3<HI>d</HI> of the ninth month 1784, aged seventy-six years. His corps being interr'd the day fol∣lowing in friends burying-ground in this city, a solemnity covered the minds of ma∣ny at the grave which was truly consolatory.</P>

<HEAD>A Testimony from <HI>New-Garden</HI> Monthly-Meet∣ing in <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> concerning <HI>WILLIAM</HI> and <HI>KATHARINE JACKSON.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THEY were born in Ireland, came into this country with their parents, and settled within the limits of New-Garden meeting. About the year 1733 they were joined in marriage, proving true help-meets to each other; and as they advanced in age, grew in grace, and a qualification for ser∣vice in the church in the prime of life, be∣ing of a meek and inoffensive disposition, well beloved and truly useful members in the meeting to which they belonged; in dealing with offenders, endeavouring to con∣vince and restore, yet careful that the testi∣mony of truth might be preserved blameless.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding their beginning in the world was small, a blessing attending their industry and frugality, they got a comfort∣able subsistance for themselves, and to bring up their family; cheerfully and kindly en∣tertaining many friends in those early days, and having a near sympathy with the mes∣sengers and servants of the Lord, who were tried and proved with humbling baptizing seasons, were often enabled to speak a word of comfort and encouragement to such; af∣fectionate and helpful to those in affliction, charitable and considerate to the poor, many partaking of their bounty, they were nearly united with friends.</P>
<P><PB N="427" REF="020377_0434_0FAF05D2C080F3B8"/>Their care over their family, and concern to bring up their children in plainness, sim∣plicity, industry, and the attendance of re∣ligious meetings, was great. Katharine thro' weakness and infirmity, particularly in old age, often endured much pain in riding to meetings, yet when there, her solid innocent countenance and deportment therein were edifying. When near her end, during several weeks painful sickness, she retained her in∣nocent sweetness of disposition, expressing resignation to her allotment; often advising her children and those about her to live in love. Some of her last expressions that could be understood, were,
<Q>There is rest and peace prepared for me, where I shall sing hallelujahs to the highest!</Q>
And after a lit∣tle pause, said,
<Q>Thy sweetness, O Lord! is great.</Q>
She quietly departed the 2<HI>d</HI> of the fourth month 1781, in the sixty-eighth year of her age, and on the 5<HI>th</HI> was interr'd in friends burying-ground at New-Garden.</P>
<P>William was supported under the trial of this separation, with becoming resignation to the divine will; having through life been an example of punctuality, justice, temper∣ance and brotherly kindness.</P>
<P>On account of bodily infirmity, which at times made riding hard to bear, he often went on foot, when above seventy-five years of age, upwards of four miles to meeting; his faithfulness and example wherein, the becoming manner of his sitting there, evi∣dencing a watchful solid frame of mind,
<PB N="428" REF="020377_0435_0FAF05D3895E50C0"/>
was very instructive. On the 22<HI>d</HI> of the tenth month 1785 (having been for some∣time much confined at home) he was taken ill, and tho' afflicted with much pain of bo∣dy, his understanding was preserved sound, and faculties clear. In the morning of the 23<HI>d</HI> to two of his children he said,
<Q>There is always something comes to take us out of the world, and if we are but prepared it is the less matter;</Q>
one of them expressing a hope that he did not feel any thing to the contrary; he replied
<Q>No, no, I don't, I have a comfortable hope and belief that all will be well.</Q>
Remarking some little time af∣ter, on the settlement of his affairs, his small beginning, and how he had been favoured through life; he expressed his concern and sympathy for divers friends in straitened circumstances, and that he had been much exercised at times on account of many in society who appeared forward and zealous, but thro' neglect or mismanagement of their outward affairs, had ministered cause of re∣proach; observing that it was wisdom not to appear in shew more than in substance, either in our religious or temporal concerns. The night of the 25<HI>th</HI> he communicated to some of his children much seasonable and heart-tendering advice; recommending a∣bove all things to strive for an everlasting inheritance, whereinto they might enter when done with time; concluding in these words,
<Q>Love truth, love one another, love friends and all good people, even all man∣kind,
<PB N="429" REF="020377_0436_0FAF05D438365D98"/>
and be careful to hurt none, no not the very meanest, if ye can do them no good, ye should do them no harm.</Q>
Then mentioning the uncertainty of his continu∣ance here, gave directions that his coffin should be plain, no polish or stain upon it.</P>
<P>Being very low on the 28<HI>th</HI> and apprehen∣sive of his end being near, he spoke to some of his children, desiring, when the change came, all might keep still and quiet; ad∣ding, it was an awful time, and ought to be so to those about him. Some hours af∣ter, saying, it would be a relief if he might be favoured in his passage, his bodily di∣stress being great;
<Q>But I must not com∣plain, it don't become us to complain, but we may tell each other of our afflictions without complaining or murmuring; for the Almighty has been good to me in my affliction, so that we have great cause to love him.</Q>
A few hours after said,
<Q>What manner of persons ought we to be, to bear every dispensation of affliction and trial that comes upon us, as we ought to do?</Q>
Saying at another time,
<Q>Many tedious days and wearisome nights had been his lot these eighteen months past.</Q>
His son ex∣pressing his belief that rest would be very acceptable, he replied,
<Q>Yes, an everlasting rest.</Q>
On the 13<HI>th</HI> of the eleventh month he uttered the following supplication,
<Q>O Lord God Almighty! if it be thy blessed will, mitigate my affliction, and relieve me in my distress; not my will but thine
<PB N="430" REF="020377_0437_0FAF05D50F593300"/>
be done.</Q>
And a little after said,
<Q>The appointed time will come, and it must be waited for, he knows best the right time; his wisdom is very great, and care and providence over his poor creatures very great indeed.</Q>
To one of his children, taking leave of him, he said, in substance,
<Q>There is great corruption in the world amongst mankind, and need there is of care in bringing up children, and young people, to restrain them; for many are running as the wild asses upon the moun∣tains.</Q>
A few days before he departed he said,
<Q>It is a comfort to me to have my children with me, and it may be a satis∣faction to them to see me go; I feel easy in mind on looking backward and for∣ward, I see nothing in my way, the Lord has been good to us, and especially to me in my affliction.</Q>
Much more he express∣ed at sundry times, continuing sensible, but gradually weakening, he departed this life, on the 24<HI>th</HI> of the eleventh month 1785, in the eighty-first year of his age, having been an elder upwards of 40 years, and having ruled well was worthy of double honour, his memory being of good savour. On the 27<HI>th</HI> he was interr'd in friends burying-ground at New-Garden; attended by a large number of people, with whom a solid meet∣ing was held.</P>

<P>A CONSIDERABLE time before his de∣cease, when in health, he sometimes mentioned to his friends, and frequently to his wife, his prospect that his time would not be long here, and in or near his last sickness, told her that he felt easy, and be∣lieved he should soon be taken from her. Some days before his death he appeared ex∣ceeding low in mind attended with many doubts respecting his past and then situ∣ation, remaining several days in great di∣stress; after which it pleased the Lord to manifest himself to him in so extraordinary a manner, that his wife perceiving a change, asked him how he was; he answered I am better than I expected ever to be, my mind is now relieved, and, as a morning without clouds, all appears sushine, mentioning to her and a friend present, many trials and temptations he had experienced; at another time saying, deep has been the baptism I have passed through, my soul hath been dipt into a feeling sense of the state of un∣believers, yea, I have passed through the valley of the shadow of death, which I am now convinced we must do before we can experience a glorious resurrection unto eter∣nal

life. And frequently said, my dear I feel thy sympathy and love, and ah! how precious do I feel the unity of the church; often mentioning divers of his near friends, and continuing in a sweet frame of mind, not complaining of pain (tho' the nature of his disease must have occasioned much) his countenance remaining serene and pleasant to the last; a few minutes before his death he spoke to this purpose,
<Q>Give my dear love to friends, and tell them I die in the faith which I lived in, and firmly believe I shall soon enter into the mansions of eter∣nal happiness prepared for the true believ∣ers in Christ; and altho' I never did much for the cause and testimony of truth, I shall be with the believers, and that is enough;</Q>
soon after which he quietly de∣parted this life, on the 6<HI>th</HI> day of the fifth month 1786, about the fiftieth year of his age; being the next day interr'd in friends burying-ground at Deer-Creek.</P>

he arrived to man's estate, having been con∣vinced of the principle of truth while young, more by inward conviction than instrumental means, as he was educated in the way of the episcopal church (so called) and even when a lad, had to pass through many trials under his father, for declining that way of wor∣ship; and (as he related to his wife and others) he frequently felt great tenderness towards the negro children with whom he was brought up, from the prospect of their state of slavery, which much affected him at times before he was ten years of age. He conducted with reputation and stability as a useful friend, manifesting a lively un∣shaken concern for the maintenance of our discipline, the furtherance of our testimony against an hireling-ministry, and slave-hold∣ing, as well as for the doctrine of peace, especially thro' the difficulties which occur∣red in the late times of public requisitions for the purposes of war; shewing christian fortitude, humility and resignation under sufferings and close trials of different kinds which fell to his lot. Sometime before his decease he appeared in public testimony, in which he was not forward, but mostly brief, pertinent and acceptable to friends; being remarkably open to receive counsel as well as to give; we find the remembrance of his disposition and service is satisfactory, both among the members of the monthly-meet∣ing he belonged to, and this meeting.</P>

<HEAD>Abstract from the Testimony of <HI>Concord</HI> Month∣ly-Meeting as read and approved by <HI>Chester</HI> Quarterly-Meeting, held at <HI>Concord</HI> the <HI>14</HI>th of the fifth month <HI>1787,</HI> concerning our dear friend <HI>EDITH SHARPLES,</HI> deceased.</HEAD>
<P>SHE was born the 13<HI>th</HI> day of the fifth month 1743; her parents Nathan and Rachel Yarnall, members of Middletown particular meeting, having been careful to educate her in plainness and a diligent at∣tendance of religious meetings, she retain∣ing a thankful remembrance of their care over her, has been often heard to bless the Lord on their account, as by their good counsel and wholesome restraint, they con∣tributed to her preservation out of the vain fashions and customs of the world.</P>
<P>By her own account, her mind was early in life accompanied with earnest desires af∣ter the knowledge of truth, and that she might never do any thing to offend him whom she often found near to her comfort, or that might bring a reproach on the pro∣fession she made; but giving way to her na∣tural vivacity, she frequently indulged her∣self in what with some is accounted i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cent pastime, for which she was often b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ght under condemnation; and about the twen∣ty-fourth year of her age was plunged into great distress, being closely beset with the wiles of an unwearied adversary; but the Lord, who will not suffer his people to be
<PB N="435" REF="020377_0442_0FAF05DC8A066418"/>
tempted beyond what they thro' his grace are enabled to bear, made way for her escape from under the power of temptation, for which she had, in that day, as on the banks of deliverance, to sing to the praise of his holy name; saying,
<Q>It is in my heart to praise thee O my deliverer! for thy ma∣nifold kindnesses unto me a poor un∣worthy worm; for altho', for disobedi∣ence, thou hast seen meet t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hide thy face for a moment; yet my s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s hum∣bly bowed before thee, rendering unto thee the praise of all thy works; having witnessed the fulfilling of thy promise.</Q>
<Q>But with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee saith the Lord thy re∣deemer.</Q></P>
<P>In the twenty-sixth year of her age she was married to Joshua Sharples, settled within the compass of New-Garden month∣ly-meeting, of which she became a useful member, being qualified for service in the church, whereto she attended with much satisfaction to friends, filling the stations of overseer and elder with diffidence under a sense of the weight thereof.</P>
<P>In the thirty-first year of her age she ap∣peared in the ministry, and being faithful, grew in her gift, was sound in doctrine, accompanied with a degree of heart-tendering authority to the careless and indolent, yet edifying and consolatory to the refreshment of the mourners in Zion.
<PB N="436" REF="020377_0443_0FAF05DD313EF2E8"/>
In her approaches to the throne of grace in public supplication, she was awfully attend∣ed with deep solemnity.</P>
<P>She was a great lover of the scriptures, and well qualified to apply them to edifica∣tion and instruction, being concerned to invite friends and others to a more frequent reading of them. The doctrines of the principle of truth as held by friends she was skilful in explaining, and was often exercised therein in mixed auditories, endeavouring to lead out of forms to the substance of true religion. Much of her time was thus em∣ployed in the public service of her Lord and master, cheerfully giving up to his holy re∣quirings, but carefully concerned to wait for his putting forth.</P>
<P>Having peculiar service in visiting fami∣lies, she was often usefully engaged there∣in; and about the year 1778 with divers other friends under appointment from the Western quarterly-meeting, in a general vi∣sit to all the meetings belonging thereto, she was exercised under a deep concern to labour that a reformation in life and manners might be really effected amongst the professors of truth. Soon after, being removed within the compass of our meeting, she engaged in a like visit to the meetings in our quarter, wherein, as in other of her gospel labours, she manifested an ardent desire for the pro∣motion of the cause of truth, and that she might be favoured to do her days work in the day-time. And since, with the concur∣rence
<PB N="437" REF="020377_0444_0FAF05DE00D3DA60"/>
of friends, visited most of the meet∣ings in the Southern governments; be∣ing diligent in the improvement of her time for the service of truth, often drawn into family visits, and to the afflicted either in body or mind, who experienced the con∣soling sympathy of her tender spirit, in which and other gospel labours she reaped the reward of peace and comfort to her own mind. When at home she was not only di∣ligent in attending meetings herself, but careful to encourage and assist her family in their duty therein; in herself an example of plainness, and mindful to promote a like simplicity in those under her direction, ma∣nifesting much concern that her children might be brought up in the truth, frequent∣ly retiring with them for their improvement, her faithfulness against wrong things in them being consistent with the tenderness of an affectionate mother. Great was her ex∣ercise for the rising generation, that their hearts might be early dedicated to the Lord, and they thereby preserved in a conduct consistent with our holy profession. Open and hospitable in her house, a true help-meet and affectionate wife.</P>
<P>Shortly after her return from a visit to friends on the Eastern-Shore of Maryland, in the sixth month 1786, she was brought very low thro' bodily indisposition, but fa∣voured with inward consolation and true peace, expressing that she felt her mind much weaned from the things of this world,
<PB N="438" REF="020377_0445_0FAF05DEF4B0AD90"/>
and if it should please the Lord to call her hence she found nothing in her way. On a first-day afternoon, divers friends being present, after a time of silence, she spoke to this effect,
<Q>I am glad of this opportunity; as I lay on the bed this morning, my mind was carried away to meeting with friends, and I thought if I had wings I could have flown thither for the great love I feel for the members of that meeting. Indeed we have had many favoured opportunities to∣gether; and you see I am in a poor weak way, and whether I shall get out again I have not seen, but am resigned, and feel the reward of peace; but if some friends of that meeting are not more faithful to the many gracious visitations which have been in mercy to them extended, weak∣ness will overtake them, and they be in danger of missing the answer of well done.</Q>
She recovered and afterwards had many heart-tendering opportunities with friends there, and others not in membership with us, toward whom she was remarkably led in testimony, in order that they might be gathered to the fold of rest.</P>
<P>About two weeks before her decease she attended several of the neighbouring meet∣ings, expressing her satisfaction therewith; and on the first-day before her departure, was at New-Garden meeting and had ac∣ceptable service, having also a favoured op∣portunity the same evening in a friends fa∣mily where she lodged on her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> home,
<PB N="439" REF="020377_0446_0FAF05DFE40B0530"/>
at which time she was concerned to revive these expressions of the Psalmist,
<Q>Lord make me to know mine end, and the mea∣sure of my days, what it is, that I may know how frail I am: Behold thou hast made my days as an hands breadth, and mine age is as nothing before thee.</Q>
Which she enlarged on to edification. Next day she got home somewhat indisposed, but held up till the day following in the evening of the 16<HI>th</HI> of the first month 1787, when she was confined to her bed, and lay in a sensible resigned frame of mind, being, as we believe, well prepared for her awful change, appearing to have nothing to do but to die. Some of the last words she was heard to say were, 'I believe I am going,' and in about fifteen minutes after, quietly breathed her last on the 18<HI>th,</HI> and on the 20<HI>th</HI> was interr'd at Birmingham, aged forty-three years and seven months, a mini∣ster upwards of 12 years.</P>
