<HEAD><HI>NARRATIVE,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>ON the 29th of March I was prevented from going on with my Character for the Evening, by a Part of the Audience calling for Mrs. <HI>Hallam,</HI> formerly an Actress in the Company, but who, for Reasons which will hereafter appear, was no longer under any En∣gagements. Mrs. <HI>Hallam,</HI> contrary to the Regulations of the Theatre, and to an express Article signed by Mr. <HI>Hallam,</HI> came through the private Door into the Theatre, and, on the Stage, where she was supported by Mr. <HI>Hallam,</HI> a Performer and principal Proprietor of the Theatre, who addressed the Audience, and obtained Permission for her to read a Paper intended for their hearing; the Purport of which was, a Complaint of having been <HI>driven</HI> unjustly from the Stage, after having been ten Years on it, without any <HI>sufficient</HI> Cause; intimating all this had been effected by my Agency. In the Confusion which followed, I was not allowed to justify myself. After some Time, I submitted, engaging to exculpate myself by a Publication in the Papers, or elsewhere.</P>
<P>THE Proceedings of this Evening, in Connection with what had passed in the Course of the Winter, left no Room to doubt of Concert between some of the Spec∣tators and Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Hallam.</HI></P>
<P>ON the 31st, a still larger Party attended the Repre∣sentation at the Theatre, with an apparent Determination to prejudge and condem me. Marks of this Determi∣nation were so renew'd and repeated, that I thought it no longer possible for me to continue on the Stage. It re∣mains for me to fulfil my Engagement with the Public: For this Purpose I shall exhibit a brief Narrative of my whole Connection with the American Theatres. The
<PB N="4" REF="032263_0003_0FF1AEF378F03BA0"/>
Result will shew, that so far from having conducted un∣justly towards Mrs. <HI>Hallam,</HI> and the Public, in Regard to her, that she has been the Source of the principal Troubles which have arisen: that my Conduct in this Respect, at least, has been becoming my Situation, and that it is I, and not she or Mr. <HI>Hallam,</HI> who have been injured on the present Occasion.</P>
<P>I was engaged from one of the first Theatres in Eng∣land, by the late Mr. <HI>John Henry,</HI> as a principal Per∣former for the New-York and Philadelphia Theatres, and arrived in this Country September 5th, 1792. An Idea instilled into me, that every Article of Life was full as cheap again here as there, made me accept a more moderate Salary than I should have done, had I been rightly informed. I was to remain for two Years and six Months, at three Guineas and a Half weekly; to be secured to me for ten Months in the Year. This Con∣tract I fulfilled on my Part, though violated in several Instances by the Managers, <HI>Hallam</HI> and <HI>Henry,</HI> and eleven Weeks of Salary due at this Hour to me and my Family from them, on my original Agreements.</P>
<P>I found the Theatre under Regulations widely dif∣ferent from my Expectations; the Managers and their Families did not know each other out of the Profession; and when they met in it, their whole Study seemed to be the sowing Dissentions and creating different Interests —a System of Government avowed and recommended by Mr. <HI>Hallam.</HI> The Consequence of this was <HI>Neg∣ligence, Party,</HI> and <HI>Strife.</HI> I soon was given to under∣stand that this had <HI>always</HI> been the Case. Mr. <HI>Henry</HI>'s Conduct and Behaviour seemed so different from the Gentleman, I had conversed with in England, that I could not avoid forming Prejudices against him, and in favour of <HI>Hallam.</HI> This Mr. <HI>Henry</HI> saw, and took an Opportunity of telling me I misjudg'd him; and that Mr. <HI>Hallam,</HI> though appearing perfectly mild and can∣did, secretly gave him every Disquiet and Misery, and had utterly broke his Temper. The Want of Unani∣mity
<PB N="5" REF="032263_0004_0FF1AEF51D9B6820"/>
at <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to a total Subversion of all Order: Pieces were given out, and no Manager attended to point a single Direction. The Orchestra was composed of about six Musicians, some of whom were incapable of their Business, and had I not been induced by Consider∣ations for my own Reputation as an Actor, to take Care that the Stage Department was not totally destroyed where I was concern'd, this neglect would have been more apparent than it was! Notwithstanding my Exertions, the Theatre was nearly deserted. Mr. <HI>Henry</HI> said he could not exist under such Torment longer, and offered to sell his Share of the Property. I urged Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> to negotiate for it, and offered to become a Purchaser after∣ward from him, and that I would undertake the conduct∣ing of the Theatre. The Terms of Sale were left for Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> to arrange with a Friend of Mr. <HI>Henry</HI>'s; and at this Period I saw a Letter of his, requesting a speedy End to the Business; for that, sooner than be concerned any longer where Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> was, he would transport himself to Botany Bay. I deemed this the Effect of violent Anger or Prejudice, and suffered it to make no Impression on my Mind at the Time.</P>
<P>IN the Month of May, 1794, Mr. <HI>Henry</HI> sold to Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> all his Share of the theatrical Property within the United States of America, for £ 4000, payable by four annual Instalments of £ 1000 each.</P>
<P>IN the same Month, I purchased from <HI>Lewis Hallam</HI> one Half the Property of the Old American Company within the United States, for £ 4000, payable by four annual Instalments of £ 1000 each.</P>
<P>DURING the Summer, I endeavoured to make such Ad∣ditions to the Company as were necessary; and on the 22d of September commenced my unfortunate Career as a Manager and Proprietor in the City of Philadelphia. On the 20th October, Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> performed Lady Rackett, in too degraded a State to be seen; and on observing that some of the Ladies of the Theatre noticed her Situation, gave them ill Language, and finished with this Expression —"Wretches that I support by my Labours!"</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="032263_0005_0FF1AEF6D374C620"/>ON the 27th of October, in a violent Fit of Intem∣perance, Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> was quarreling with Mr. <HI>Ashton,</HI> a Member of the Company; and as the Performance of "Wild Oats," was then proceeding, I mildly interfered, and begged her for the Present to treat whatever the Matter was as not worth her Notice. She immediately commenced a strain of Invective and Abuse, such as I had never heard, or ever did expect to hear, from the Mouth of a Female <HI>Rascal! Scoundrel! Swindler</HI> of her Husband's Property! and other Epithets equally unjust, for two Hours was I baited with; and during the Per∣formance of the After-piece, "Don Juan," every Mock and Ridicule that could be was cast on my Endeavours to conduct so troublesome a Pantomime to its Close. Some of the Performers then with us, still remain.</P>
<P>ON the Morning of the 28th, I wrote Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> a Letter to the following Effect: "That having taken twelve Hours to pause on the unmerited Treatment I had received, I must beg to decline any further official Capacity in the Old American Company: observing, that the Property had been so little a Time in my Hands; Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> could receive no Inconveniency by accept∣ing it back on the same Terms I had purchased; that I had no Wish to distress him by an immediate Re∣moval, but would stay with him upon the Fulfilment of my original Engagements to the Expiration of them, or the conclusion of the following York Season." To this Letter Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> wrote the following:
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I cannot answer you—I have not closed my Eyes from the Circumstance of last Night—Will you meet me at <HI>Oell<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> Tavern, and we will dine alone?</P>
</LETTER></P>
<P>I want as usual, to the Theatre, to conduct the Re∣hearsal, and in some little Time after my Arrival there <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Message from Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI>—that she was at my <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to see me. I returned for answer,
<PB N="7" REF="032263_0006_0FF1AEF9928A3B28"/>
I was at the Theatre, and could not attend Mrs. <HI>Hallam.</HI> She sent my Servant back to say she must see me, and that if I would not wait on her then, she would remain till I should come Home. I determined on seeing her: She began with Tears, a very strong Apology for her Con∣duct, and said she was utterly ruined with Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> if I persisted in resigning the Property. I asked her if she remembered the Events of the preceding Evening? She replied, she had no Recollection of them, and that my Letter to her Husband was a Thunderbolt to her. I repeated the Epithets she had made use of, and she <HI>seemed</HI> very much shock'd. She begged my forgetfulness of the past, solemnly asserting she should look upon herself as the veriest Wretch existing, should she ever, by similar Imprudence, risk a future Misunderstanding. I forgave her sincerely, and we parted. I dined the same Day at a Tavern, with Mr. <HI>Hallam,</HI> according to his Appoint∣ment, who seemed, and I believe was most sensibly affect∣ed, and I recollect made use of the following Expression:
<Q>I know that Girl so well, I'm sure she never will for∣give herself, or drink any Thing but Water as long as she lives.</Q>
I told Mr. <HI>Hallam,</HI> it was a Failing that, if not put an effectual Stop to, would destroy every Pos∣sibility of my Continuance in the Company, or Manage∣ment. I proceeded, as usual, in my Capacity of Acting-Manager, and on the 14th of November she was again intemperate and abusive when performing Lady Fan∣court, in the Comedy of "Love's Frailties." My Wife also now began to feel the Effects of her Pride, and was frequently treated with every Contempt. I closed that Theatre on the 4th of December, after ten Weeks of woeful managerial Experience.</P>
<P>I commenced in New-York, December 15th, and on the 20th Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> was again in a State which incapacitated her for performing Miss Walsingham, in the "School for Wives," in a suitable Manner. On the 29th she was considerably worse in the Character of Marianne, in the "Dramatist." On the 5th of January,
<PB N="8" REF="032263_0007_0FF1AEFC6705F1C8"/>
1795, we performed "Percy," and in the Fight with Douglas, I, by Accident, cut Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI>'s Hand: Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> came behind the Scenes in a violent Rage, and on being asked what had disturbed her, replied, "Why! that damn'd Butcher has cut Mr. <HI>Hallam!</HI>" On the 6th of January, I wrote Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> the following Letter:
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON so disagreeable a Business, as it is my Duty to come to a perfect Explanation with you, I was in hope I might gain an Opportunity of personal Remon∣strance: But no—you seem to shun me! I had adopted a certainty that after the very unmerited and illiberal Language heaped on my by Mrs. <HI>Hallam,</HI> in Philadelphia, and her solemn Oath, I never should hear a Repetition, it would have ceased. Why, Sir, am I so frequently the Cause of her present Vengeance? And why do you not take Measures to prevent such Conduct? Is it because every Moment of my Life is dedicated to promoting our mutual Interest? Is it be∣cause I am incessantly studying to make the Theatre respectable, and increase your Welfare and Prosperity? Why, Sir, last Night, for an Accident of trivial Na∣ture, had I the very delicate Term of <HI>Butcher</HI> applied to me? And why, a few Evenings back again, that of <HI>Swindler</HI> and <HI>Rascal?</HI> Good God, Sir, if either have a Claim on the other for Gratitude, I think it is due from you, and that your Property by this Time, had I not stepped in and prop'd it, would have fallen to the Ground. It becomes no Plea to assert that <HI>Reason</HI> has no Share in these Declarations: They are private Sentiments, which Reason smoothers, and that banish'd, the Soul is thrown open undisguised. I feel your Situation, Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI>: I am cut to the Heart to see it, but I cannot, will not, remain indif∣ferent to my own. My Wife, Sir, is not permitted nor does she endeavour or wish to know more of Bu∣siness
<PB N="9" REF="032263_0008_0FF1AEFE1933D010"/>
than I casually communicate; and as I cannot compliment Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> with a better Head than my own, I dont think she can fairly judge my Actions, and I am certain you <HI>ought</HI> not to permit her; at any Rate I <HI>will</HI> not; and I think it but honest to inform you, the next Time I hear <HI>her</HI> make Use of my Name undeservedly, I will immediately throw up the Business, and call the Public as an Umpire between us. Let Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> vent illiberal Language on her Dependants, if she must use it; I am <HI>none:</HI> And as to the Property which she is weak enough to imagine so infallible, I would rather give it up than have another Hour's concern where she is or will be a Meddler.— Sir, we are a City Talk; and it would certainly be better to endeavour that Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> should be kept at Home, than suffered to expose us and herself, when so unfit to be seen. I know, Sir, I am speaking in plain Terms; I think it my Duty to do so. Delica∣cy, when we throw apart ourselves, we cannot expect others to preserve for us: * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Once more, Sir, be assured, my Friendship and good Wishes are undiminished; so much so, that I con∣ceive it an indispensable Duty to use no Reserve; but, pointing out the Obstacles that destroy our Harmony, give an Opportunity of removing them, or breaking the Whole at once.</P>

<NOTE N="☞" PLACE="foot">There is an Omission in the Letter, where the Stars are. The Part left out, related entirely to his Son; and as he is no Way impli∣cated in this Controversy, it would not be proper to mention it.</NOTE>
<P><PB N="10" REF="032263_0009_0FF1AF0133E27498"/>THIS Letter I received no Answer to, but was in∣formed Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> seemed much concerned on perusing it. On the 10th of January, Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> (again in a State of partial Intoxication) performed Lady Euston, in "I'll tell you What." On the 28th equally so in the Marchioness Merida, "Child of Nature." On the 25th February, I brought forward the Comedy of the "<HI>Jew,</HI>" for the first Time in this Theatre; and in the elegant chaste Character of Eliza Ratcliffe, the Audience witnessed an Exhibition too disgustful to remember, and too disgraceful to the Stage to be dwelt upon. The general Cry seemed to be—"She must insult us no more!" I informed Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> of this, in Company with a Gentleman who has been long his Friend, and both our Opinions were, that if Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> risked ano∣ther Appearance, the People would shew their Resent∣ment. Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> determined on withdrawing her, and begged from me the disagreeable Office of communicat∣ing to her the Resolution. I undertook this, and a Scene so distressing, so harrassing to the Feelings, I scarce ever did witness, and hope never may again. She was from before the Public one Month, and the The∣atre progressed with every possible Harmony and Credit. During this Time, a Report was industriously circulated that Laudanum was the Cause of Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI>'s frequent Incapability. The Public Voice turned, and there was a Wish to see her again. Convinced, <HI>whatever was the Cause,</HI> it would be her Study in future to avoid that <HI>particu∣lar</HI> Thing, which brought her Weakness before the Public Eye, I took Advantage of this Prepossession, and told Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> I was certain, if she appeared, she would be greatly received. I did this because I felt Conviction her late Mortification must have been a strong Monitor, and possibly a Reformation must ensue, both in Conduct behind the Scenes and on the Stage. On the 25th of March she reassumed her Profession in Lady Teazle. The second Character she represented was Cordelia, March 30th, in which she was not perfectly herself. On
<PB N="11" REF="032263_0010_0FF1AF0469920760"/>
the 10th of April she performed Louisa, in the "World in a Village," and several People in Disgust left the Theatre. On the 11th of May she performed Miss Ne∣ville, in "Know your own Mind," a Comedy got up by me, about a Fortnight before, for Mrs. <HI>Hodgkinson</HI>'s Benefit. My Wife dressed in the same Room, and a little Time after Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI>'s Arrival, she commenced her abuse of me, and of the Character she was going to represent; and, looking in my Wife's Face, cried, "Damn the Play; damn the Person who got it up, and damn the Person for whom it <HI>was</HI> got up." The next Day I requested Mrs. <HI>Hodgkinson</HI> to quit that Room. I then wrote to Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> the following Letter:
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have delayed, till Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI>'s Benefit was past, communicating my Determination on our future Con∣nection. After the most minute Investigation on the Possibility of Friendship or Harmony existing, I find none. There are Obstacles insurmountable. I have combated them in Hope; I have borne them from sincere Attachment. When I became a Partner in this Theatre, it was not with the Hope of bettering my Situation: It was to make it permanent; it was to support, as far as I could, <HI>you</HI>; because I conceived you injured and oppressed by your former Connection. My Opinion now is, that whatever might have been Mr. <HI>Henry</HI>'s other Failings, he saw you your own Enemy, and was convinced an unworthy Influence made you other People's. I will not dwell on what, with me, is fix'd as Fate: We must separate. I am anxious to regain that Peace which as a private Indivi∣dual no Man possessed in a higher Degree. I wish to resign the Management. If you will not take the Property on the Valuation of three unprejudiced Per∣sons, I will certainly advertise my Share to the highest Bidder. Mr. <HI>C</HI>— is in full Possession of my Senti∣ments.
<PB N="12" REF="032263_0011_0FF1AF0A02B96728"/>
I would wish you to advise with him on the best and most peaceable Mode of transacting this Busi∣ness, and or acquainting our Subscribers to the new Theatre.</P>

</LETTER></P>
<P>ON Monday, May 18th, the Comedy of "Which is the Man?" was performed; and the Hair-Dresser who attended Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> came to my Room to say that it was impossible for her to go on the Stage that Night, for she was so senseless she could not sit in her Chair! It was a Benefit, and therefore the Audience could not well be dismissed. When the Hour of com∣mencing arrived, I was requested, three several Times, to delay the Performance, while she had Vinegar and strong Green Tea given, to restore her as much as possi∣ble. When she did come forward, let those who wit∣nessed the Spectacle declare the Shame of it.</P>
<P>I had soon after a Meeting with Mr. <HI>Hallam,</HI> at the House of one of the most respectable Characters in this City; and two other Gentlemen, as mutual Friends, attended to give their Advice. I stated my Grievances plainly before them, and they uniformly agreed it was impossible for me to remain any longer in the Theatre if Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> did; and one of them observed,—
<Q>Mr. <HI>Hallam,</HI> I have heretofore been anxious to suppress and do away Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI>'s Misfortune, as a Calum∣ny; but, Sir, I was present at the Representation of <HI>Which is the Man?</HI> and when I saw her come on the Stage, I immediately left the House; and had any one plunged a Sword through my Heart, it could not have given me a keener Pang than I felt at that Mo∣ment.</Q>
Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> said he had no Reply to make▪ he could not deny any Thing I had asserted, and that he knew my Situation to be dreadful! I offered him, once
<PB N="13" REF="032263_0012_0FF1AF0D2B2C4EA0"/>
more, the Property on the same Terms that I had pur∣chased it. This he declined, and promised, before the Gentlemen who had interested themselves, to withdraw Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> from the Stage totally at the Conclusion of the Season; commissioning me, at the same Time, to procure an Actress in her Place from England. I wrote, by the earliest Vessel, for Mrs. <HI>Johnson,</HI> and she arrived here on the first of October following. The Calamity that afflicted this City in the Autumn of 1795 compelled us to make a Treaty for the Boston Theatre; and I was not a little surprised, while in Hartford, to hear that Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> had returned to the Stage, and was performing at Providence, with Mr. <HI>Hallam.</HI> Some few Days after our arrival in Boston, Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> waited on me, to say, that he should make his first Essay before that Audience in Lord Ogleby, and that Mrs. <HI>Hallam must</HI> perform the Character of Miss Sterling! I made no Reply; I was too much astonished! I parted with him to reflect on what had passed. I made Enquiries of the Performers respecting Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI>'s Conduct at Providence. They were all agreed it had, if possible, been worse than ever. I felt shock'd at Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI>'s Duplicity: a manifest Vio∣lation of his Word, without even an Attempt at Apolo∣gy; without any Reason but "it must be so!" Entire Strangers, as we were, a Misunderstanding, immediately on our Appearance before the Public, would have been Ruin. I submitted in Silence. In the mean Time I stood highly implicated to Mrs. <HI>Johnson</HI>▪ who had come three thousand Miles to supply a Line of Characters Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI>'s Insincerity would deprive her of. Mrs. <HI>John∣son,</HI> however, with the greatest Generosity, in Part re∣lieved me, by saying that Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> might retain all the Characters she <HI>had</HI> performed: but that, in the Ar∣rangement of new Pieces, she should expect her Engage∣ment fulfilled, by being given the elegant Characters in Comedy. This I not only promised, but stood pledged to. My Situation as Manager now became more irk∣some than ever. Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> quarrelled with me because
<PB N="14" REF="032263_0013_0FF1AF0ECA980D28"/>
he did not perform many of the young, First Rate Cha∣racters, which he said he had supplied since his first Ar∣rival in America, and that he had not resigned them, nor ever would. Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> poured on me every odious Epithet that Intemperance could suggest. An Opportu∣nity offered of releasing myself from this Misery, by an Offer of Connection with the Boston Theatre; but, after some Reflection, my Respect for the Patronage I had experienced from the Citizens of New-York determined me on not accepting it. Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> was taken ill, and I felt some Alarm, that as yet he had never conveyed my Share of the Property to me, though I had frequently so∣licited to have it done, and had paid a Part of the Pur∣chase Money. He recovered, and I again applied. He begged it might be postponed till our Arrival in New-York. I agreed reluctantly. When we <HI>did</HI> arrive in New-York, I repeated my Request. I was not success∣ful, till, finally, I sent Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> Word I would not enter the Theatre till the Deeds were executed. I got legal Possession last March, 22 Months after the Pur∣chase had been made. I think it but Justice to declare, that I was <HI>informed</HI> this Conduct was not Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI>'s Will, but that Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> could not be prevailed on to sign. I had frequently conversed with Mr. <HI>Dunlap,</HI> re∣specting my Situation, and the Torture I laboured un∣der; and as I knew him to be attached to the Theatre, in one of our Conversations, I offered to sell him Half my Share, if he would undertake the Acting Manage∣ment; for that I had more Labour than the Mind or Body could possibly sustain. I had applied to Mr. <HI>Hallam,</HI> to know what he meant to allow me for my ex∣traordinary Fatigue, and he had peremptorily refused any Compensation; which I thought hard, because, on the first Commencement of Theatrical Business after our Partnership, we had paid a Gentleman <HI>One Hundred Pounds</HI> for acting as Treasurer and Book-keeper only ten Weeks. And here I hope it will not be deemed an un∣necessary Digression, if I mention what my Situation
<PB N="15" REF="032263_0014_0FF1AF11FB543F68"/>
exactly was. I had to cast and arrange the Business of every Play brought forward. I had the various Tem∣pers, Rivalships, and Ambitions of thirty or forty Peo∣ple to encounter and please. I kept all the Accounts; I made all Disbursements, and was made, in all Money Transactions, solely responsible. My professional La∣bours were extreme, and I never finished them for the Evening that I did not attend to take the State of each Night's Receipts. Nay, instead of enjoying my com∣fortable Hour of social Intercourse with my Family, on my Arrival Home, I had a Check Account to take, and to make the regular Entries in my Books. I wrote and corrected every Play-Bill for the Printer. I planned and copied every Scene-Plot for the Carpenter. I attended every Rehearsal, to give Directions. I went through a varied and extensive Line of Characters on the Stage. I found principally my own Wardrobe for them; and my Salary, for all this, was twenty Dollars per Week, paid only when we performed! Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> received the same, and had no Share in the Fatigue. His Answer to me, on Application to know what he would allow me, was, that "he would quit the Theatre the Moment any Man received a Shilling more than him." An idea exceed∣ingly unjust; for at the Time of his Purchase from <HI>John Henry,</HI> the Shares were, Mr. <HI>Henry</HI> Four and a Half, Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> Three and a Half; and when Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> agreed with me, he reserved the Difference: for the whole Property being equally divided between us, Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> gained a Sixteenth; as he paid Mr. <HI>Henry</HI> no more for Four and a Half Shares, than I did him (Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI>) for Four Shares.</P>
<P>To return to my Narrative: Mr. <HI>Dunlap</HI> seemed in∣clined to treat with me, and finally was introduced, as Acting Manager, into the Theatre, with the Concur∣rence of Mr. <HI>Hallam,</HI> and to receive my Assistance. I flattered myself I was now some little Distance removed from my Disquiets; but I was disappointed. Mr. <HI>Dunlap</HI>'s
<PB N="16" REF="032263_0015_0FF1AF152E0FCF20"/>
Inexperience compell'd me still to be the Director in the Stage Department, according to Agreement, and I never gave an Order in Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI>'s hearing that she did not pointedly ridicule and insult me. My Wife never pass'd her, that she was not treated with every Mark of Con∣tempt; and those who may lack Information on this Part, or labor under a different Impression, I here inform, that she never made one Word of Reply. I now ac∣quainted Mr. <HI>Dunlap,</HI> it was impossible for me to stay and perform my Agreements with him; and a very, very irksome and disagreeable Correspondence took Place, between us in Consequence: I offer'd to sell him the remaining Share I held, or to put it into his Hands as a Trust and Security, that he should not be a Loser by my Absence: He accepted the latter, and I wrote to the Philadelphia Managers my Resolution, and of my Wish to gain a Situation in their Theatre. They, I presume, thought my Services of some Value for both arriv'd Post here, and convers'd personally with me on the Business. I asked my Terms, and to their Honor let me thus publicly declare, I never did experience in any Negociation more Candor and Liberality; and had I left New-York, their Acquiescence in my Demands must have prov'd to me and my Family infinitely more valua∣ble than any Thing I ever did, or probably may hereafter attain. About this Time Mr. <HI>Dunlap</HI> waited on me, to say, that if I could not remain in the Company, and per∣form my first Contracts with him, he must relinquish his Purchase, tho' subjected to very great Loss and Incon∣venience thereby: He also informed me, he had <HI>written Mr.</HI> Hallam, <HI>that Mrs.</HI> Hallam<HI>'s Continuance in the Theatre was an insuperable Objection to his making any Arrangement with him.</HI> I replied, I <HI>could</HI> not—I <HI>would</HI> not stay; and that I preferr'd retiring peaceably, to waging open Controversy with Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI>; who, in my Opinion, from his long Services, had an unquestionable prior Right to his Situation:—that I felt the Injuries of Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> and his Family forcibly; but that I was
<PB N="17" REF="032263_0016_0FF1AF16CB80EA70"/>
better able to provide for, and bear the Evils of Separa∣tion, than he was, and I would not retaliate. I relin∣quish'd the Sale I had made to Mr. <HI>Dunlap,</HI> and he quitted the Business. On the 17th of June last, I wrote Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> the following Letter:
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Season approaching to a Conclusion, it is necessary that the State in which our Property will be involv'd by a Separation, should be accurately deter∣min'd and finally put to Agreement. Our Continu∣ance of Partnership is impossible—and therefore it behoves both of us to promptly act as mutual Justice may demand:—Repeated Insult and Injury have steel'd me against further Connection; and I have only left to make such Arrangements as will secure to me a Prevention of total Loss, in what I have taken so much Pains to uphold and increase. You are not ignorant that the Theatres, belonging to us, cannot be justly employed bv either without the Consent of his equal. It is not my Wish that the Property should go to ruin: I Wish it to be prosperous: I have brought it to that Permanency and Respectability that Miscon∣duct alone can make it otherwise. Your Resources, by the Return of Capt. <HI>Adamson,</HI> will be encreased: [here follow'd the Names of some Performers ex∣pected over]—These, with what you will have left, and in your Power to retain, will form a good Com∣pany;—and the following are Terms on which I will leave you in peaceable Possession of the Whole, or on which I will take the Management myself; each per∣mitting the other to make use of his Talents in any future Way or Situation he may chuse. I will <HI>give you</HI> Two Thousand Five Hundred Dollars, for the Use of your Share and Property, till the First of next May; I taking all Profits that may accrue up to that Time, &amp;c.—This Agreement reservable only at the Option of the Parties.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Philip Ten Eyck,</HI> was kind enough to bear this Let∣ter; and some Time after I met him in Broadway, when I was in Company with an Agent, who had arriv'd from Philadelphia to complete my Engagements for that City: I enquir'd Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI>'s Determination, and was told he wished some Days for Consideration. I inform'd Mr. <HI>Ten Eyck,</HI> that my peculiar Situation requir'd an Answer on the following Morning; and that I could not wait longer than that Period. I urg'd Mr. <HI>Ten Eyck</HI> to return to Mr. <HI>Hallam,</HI> and he did so: Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> then pro∣mised a definitive Answer by Mr. <HI>Ten Eyck</HI> the next Day. At the appointed Hour▪ Mr. <HI>Ten Eyck</HI> waited on me, and found at my House Mr. <HI>Dunlap,</HI> and the Agent from Philadelphia. Mr. <HI>Ten Eyck</HI> observed, that Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> had commissioned him to say, that
<Q>he knew the Cause of our Differences, but they should cease; for he would withdraw Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> from the Stage, which he presumed would reconcile the Whole.</Q>
I an∣swered Mr. <HI>Ten Eyck,</HI> that it would not; that Mrs. <HI>Hal∣lam</HI>'s being withdrawn was no Stipulation of mine; for as Mr. <HI>Hallam,</HI> had once before openly broke his Word with me on that Score, I had thought it needless to men∣tion as a Difficulty, what if promis'd to be remov'd, would not be long maintained: That Mr. <HI>Dunlap,</HI> I believed, had quitted the Theatre, upon finding it im∣possible
<PB N="19" REF="032263_0018_0FF1AF1A18ED87E0"/>
to conduct it with Propriety, if Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> continued, and had written Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> a Letter to that Effect: That Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI>'s last Difficulty with me was, his having laid Claim to many of the most principal and youthful Characters in the Drama, which I thought he had resigned long ago, such as Hamlet, Ranger, Zanga, Orestes, Benedick, Don John, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> and his informing Mr. <HI>Dunlap</HI> that I had injured him, by not giving him out for them; but that now he expected them to be brought forward; and that all that I wanted from Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> now, was an Answer respecting my Proposal of our Property. Mr. <HI>Ten Eyck</HI> observed, he was no Way privileged to speak on that, as he had sup∣posed Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> the great Objection. I replied, she was so; but remarked again, I had conceived no Use in mentioning an Impossibility. Mr. <HI>Ten Eyck</HI> requested Mr. <HI>Dunlap</HI> to accompany him to Mr. <HI>Hallam:</HI> They went together, and, some Time after, Mr. <HI>Dunlap</HI> re∣turned, with Information, that Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> was not only willing to take Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> from the Stage, but to leave the casting of all Pieces to his (<HI>Dunlap</HI>'s) Judgment; and that he was willing to enter <HI>into Contracts,</HI> with <HI>any Penalty,</HI> for the Performance of what should be agreed on, as the best Mode to secure our future Peace. I ob∣served, that, wearied by my repeated Disappointments, I wished no further Connection with Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI>; and that I conceived I had proceeded too far in my Philadelphia Engagement to honourably recede. Mr. <HI>Dunlap</HI> dif∣fered with me in this, and remarked, that he had quit∣ted a Business, in Part, to purchase my Property; and that he must inevitably experience great Loss by my De∣parture: That while he saw no Prospect of my Griev∣ances being redressed, he was content to submit; but, now that there was a Certainty of their being remedied, he must in Duty call on me to fulfil my Engagements wih him, or that he should be compelled to seek for Restitution in some other Way. Finally, I broke off my Philadelphia Negociation, and concluded to remain
<PB N="20" REF="032263_0019_0FF1AEECE3DF6150"/>
once more. Contracts were ordered to be drawn up; and I inquired of Mr. <HI>Dunlap,</HI> if Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI>'s Name was to be inserted? He replied, it would be more deli∣cate to omit her Name, as they could be made equally forcible, without mentioning <HI>her.</HI> I applauded the Idea. The following are the Articles, which Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> had three Days in his Possession, previous to signing; and they were made to extend to <HI>Two Years, at his own Request</HI></P>

<P><PB N="23" REF="032263_0022_0FF1AF25EBA7C030"/>IN the Course of the present Winter, Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> has appeared much dissatisfied. It was many Times ru∣moured that he intended to force his Wife on the Stage: But about the 9th or 10th of February, Mr. <HI>Dunlap</HI> in∣formed me, that Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> had called on him, to let him know that Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> ought to be engaged: And on Mr. <HI>Dunlap</HI>'s replying, that he thought "that Mat∣ter had been settled in June last," had only answered by charging me with sending him in an Account of Money due to me; and by asserting the Injuries done to his Wife; concluding with saying, that—<HI>he had prevented Disturbances in the Theatre; but he would do so no longer.</HI></P>
<P>ABOUT the 14th of February, Mr. <HI>Dunlap</HI> informed me that he had waited on Mr. <HI>Hallam,</HI> having requested a Gentleman to witness the Conversation; when Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> confirmed the above Determination; and, on being reminded of his Engagements, said, "I did tell Mr. <HI>Ten Eyck</HI> that I would withdraw Mrs. <HI>Hallam,—but I did not say for how long</HI>:" That he told Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> that he should consider his Attempt to force Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> on the Stage as a Violation of the Articles; and was an∣swered, <HI>he might</HI> THINK <HI>as he pleased:</HI> That he told Mr. <HI>Hallam,</HI> that if there was any Disturbance in the The∣atre, on Account of Mrs. <HI>Hallam,</HI> after the Avowal that she had waited upon a Number of Ladies, who had espoused her Quarrel, he should consider him <HI>(Hallam)</HI> as the Cause; and was answered, <HI>he might</HI> THINK <HI>as he pleased:</HI> That on saying he <HI>(Dunlap)</HI> must take Mea∣sures for the Security of his Property, he was answered, <HI>he might</HI> DO <HI>as he pleased.</HI></P>
<P>FINDING that the Dissatisfactions of Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> con∣tinued; hearing that he intended to introduce his Wife on the Stage, during the Benefits; and convinced that the Dissolution of the Company must be the Conse∣quence, to the great Injury of the Performers, as well as of the Proprietors; I determined, with the Concur∣rence of Mr. <HI>Dunlap,</HI> and the Advice of Gentlemen whom I supposed Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI>'s Friends, to make him
<PB N="24" REF="032263_0023_0FF1AF2856215438"/>
Proposals that might prevent Violence, and terminate all Differences to his Satisfaction. Many Modes were premised by these Friends, and they can vouch I did not, I would not listen to any, that had not for its End the <HI>future Comfort and Independence of Mr. Hallam.</HI>— With this View the following Letter was sent to him:

<P>THAT <HI>Lewis Hallam</HI> shall sell his Theatrical Pro∣perty, known by the Name of "Property of the Old American Company," at such Price, and on such Terms, as may be hereafter determined; quitting, by such Sale, all Claim or Title whatsoever on said Com∣pany or Property, to <HI>William Dunlap</HI> and <HI>John Hodg∣kinson</HI>; they giving satisfactory Security for the Ful∣filment of the Terms of Sale; and, <HI>moreover,</HI> agree∣ing <HI>to pay to Lewis Hallam One Fourth of the Profits aris∣ing from the Exhibitions of said Company, in any Part of the United States of America, or any Denomination whatsoever, during the Period of the natural Life of Lewis Hallam, to be paid yearly, on the first Day of May:</HI> And this in Consideration of the Good-Will of the said <HI>Lewis Hallam</HI> toward said Property or Busi∣ness, according to the Usage of Men retiring and giving up any fixed Business to other Men.</P>

<P><PB N="25" REF="032263_0024_0FF1AF2B6B24E430"/>TO this Letter Mr. <HI>Dunlap</HI> received no Answer, ex∣cept, that, in a Conversation which took Place between Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> and me, on (I think) the 20th of March, he said, he did not know that he should <HI>sell his Property at all</HI>; and, if he accepted a Sinecure, it must not only be a <HI>certain, but a large one!</HI> On being asked how he could expect a <HI>large Certainty?</HI> he replied, the United States were peculiarly situated: A War might take Place, and the Theatres be either shut up, or, from Distress, deserted.</P>

<P><PB N="26" REF="032263_0025_0FF1AF31B50C7990"/>ON the Monday Evening following, Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> came into my Dressing-Room, and told me he did not chuse to comply with those Rules. I told him I was sorry to hear it, and that I supposed he could not violate them, without violating also the Contracts that existed between us! He replied, he chose to violate them, and that he had torn them down, and set us at Defiance.</P>
<P>THE Wednesday following, the Transaction took Place which I have briefly stated as the Motive for this Narrative, in which I trust it will appear,—1st, That, by Articles entered into voluntarily by Mr. <HI>Hallam,</HI> the Purport of which was known to him, and to which he was explicitly advised by his Friends, Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> had no Right to come on the Stage, or Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> to demand it: —2d, That Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> had not been withdrawn by any Stipulation of mine, at the Time of the present Agree∣ment; but by Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI>'s own free Offer and apparent Conviction, that her Conduct had made it improper for her to remain before the Public, and impossible for a respectable Stage to be where she was a Performer:— 3d, That Mr. <HI>Hallam,</HI> in favouring the Attempt to re∣produce Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> on the Stage, and in attempting himself to introduce her; as well as by tearing down the Regulations of the Acting-Manager; has not only vio∣lated his Contracts, but treated the Public with Disre∣spect, and the other Proprietors with Injustice.</P>
<P>IN Regard to the Proceedings of the 29th and 31st of March, I can only observe, the Prejudice and Misrepre∣sentation that unhappily prevailed, have compelled me to the <HI>most painful and irksome</HI> Mode of justifying myself— that of exposing <HI>many</HI> Transactions, to public View, which none but the Parties concerned ever ought to have been made acquainted with, or interested in; and I trust my prior Determinations of quitting my Situation, rather than make this Exposure, will convince every Reader, the Differences stated would never have been known thro' me, had not every Means been tried to render my Conduct completely odious to the Parties who came
<PB N="27" REF="032263_0026_0FF1AF3361C7F300"/>
forward on this Occasion, that <HI>Calumny</HI> could suggest. I have been made <HI>accountable</HI> for an Action I was not concerned in, or in my Power solely to remedy! as a second Perusal of our Contracts will <HI>convince.</HI> It has been also asserted, that Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> only <HI>applied</HI> to have Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> perform at his Benefit: This is not a Fact.— Mr. HALLAM <HI>has never</HI> made <HI>any</HI> Application, but that to Mr. <HI>Dunlap,</HI> in which he stated Mrs. HALLAM <HI>ought to be engaged in the Company!</HI> His Son applied on his own account, but Mr. <HI>Hallam,</HI> sen, was never mentioned.</P>
<P>I beg Leave also further to remark, that the Situation I was placed in was so peculiarly trying, none but an Actor, or a Person who has made himself responsible for a <HI>well regulated Entertainment,</HI> can possibly feel or judge.</P>
<P>I was received, for the first Time in my Life, with pointed disapprobation, before I could even speak. A Person who had no Connection with the Stage, whose own Faults had deservedly banished her from it—was called for—was secreted, ready to burst forward—was protected—supported by her own Husband, in direct Violation of his most solemn Contracts—was allowed to address the Audience—and I not suffered to explain or to defend myself, when I was the Party, and the only Party injured! If, at such a Crisis, I betrayed any im∣proper Marks of Impatience, I trust they were such as few Men could refrain from, under such distressing Cir∣cumstances.</P>
<P>THE Situation of a Theatrical Performer seems here to be peculiarly unfortunate: Strong Prejudices are en∣tertained against the Profession, and against the Drama itself, by many. There are also those who consider Actors as Public Slaves, who are to have no Will of their own, but are bound to be the obedient and submissive Victims of their Caprice; and so wide is the Prepossession against the Calling, that <HI>many</HI> look upon an Actor as Something different from his fellow Men.</P>
<P>IN Consequence of these Prejudices, that is deemed <HI>Insolence</HI> in an Actor, which would scarcely be called
<PB N="28" REF="032263_0027_0FF1AF356EE83978"/>
Spirit in another Man; and thus a Profession, which, to excel in, requires the Union of many Talents and Ac∣complishments, and in particular <HI>Feeling,</HI> the Professor, on some Occasions, is not allowed to <HI>feel at all.</HI> But this is certainly unjust: Resentment should always be measured by the Nature of the Injury, not the <HI>Profession,</HI> of the In∣dividual. I felt myself aggrieved: I was not allowed to defend myself: Few Men are so much Masters of their Temper, as to conduct with perfect Propriety in such Circumstances! I might fail in this; if I did, it must be ascribed to the peculiar Irritation of the Moment; for I hope I scarce need add, I could never entertain an Idea, of treating with indecorum, that Public, from whom I have receiv'd the most constant and flattering Marks of Approbation—to whose Justice I now make my last Ap∣peal▪ Whose Candor will, I am convinced, acquit me after this hearing, and whose</P>
