<HEAD>THE VILLAGE MERCHANT: A POEM.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>SPRUNG from a race that long had till'd the soil</L>
<L>And first dis-rob'd it of its native trees,</L>
<L>He chose to heir their lands, but not their toil,</L>
<L>And thought the ploughman's life no life of ease—</L>
<L>"'Tis wrong (thought he) these pretty hands to wound</L>
<L>"With felling oaks, or delving in the ground:</L>
<L>"I who, at least have forty pounds in cash</L>
<L>"And in a country store might cut a dash,</L>
<L>"Why should I till these barren fields (he said)</L>
<L>("I who have learnt to cypher, write, and read)</L>
<L>"These fields that shrubs, and weeds, and brambles bear,</L>
<L>"That pay me not, and only bring me care?"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some thoughts had he, long while, to quit the sod</L>
<L>In sea-port towns to try his luck in trade,</L>
<L>But then their ways of living seem'd most odd —</L>
<L>For dusty streets to leave his native shade,</L>
<L>From grassy plats to pebbled walks remov'd—</L>
<L>The more he thought of them the less he lov'd:</L>
<L>The city-springs he could not drink; and still</L>
<L>Preferr'd the fountain, underneath the hill.—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="027019_0003_0FD33035E5EEB568"/>
<L>And yet no splendid objects there were seen</L>
<L>No distant scenes in gaudy colours clad,</L>
<L>Look where you wou'd the prospect still was mean,</L>
<L>Scrub-oaks, and scatter'd pines, and aspins sad—</L>
<L>Banks of a shallow river stain'd with mud;</L>
<L>A stream where never swell'd the tide of flood,</L>
<L>No lofty ship her topsails did unloose,</L>
<L>Nor sailor sail'd —except in log-canoes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It would have puzzled Faustus to have told,</L>
<L>What did attach him to this paltry spot</L>
<L>Where even the house he heir'd was very old,</L>
<L>And half his fences hardly worth a groat:</L>
<L>Yet so it was, the fancy took his brain</L>
<L>A country shop might here some custom gain:—</L>
<L>Whiskey, he knew, would always be in vogue</L>
<L>While there are country squires to take a cogue,</L>
<L>Laces and lawns would draw each rural maid,</L>
<L>And one must have her <HI>shawl,</HI> and one her <HI>shade.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hard by the road a pigmy building stood,</L>
<L>Thatch'd was its roof, and earthen were its floors:</L>
<L>So small its size, that (in a jesting mood)</L>
<L>It might he call'd a house turn'd out of doors—</L>
<L>Yet here, adjacent to an aged oak</L>
<L>Full fifty years <HI>old dad</HI> his hams did smoke,</L>
<L>Nor ceas'd the trade, till worn with years, and spent,</L>
<L>To Pluto's smoke-house he himself was sent.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hither our merchant turn'd his curious eye</L>
<L>And mus'd awhile upon this fable shell▪</L>
<L><HI>Here father smoak'd his hogs</HI> (he said) <HI>and why,</HI></L>
<L><HI>In truth, may not our garret do as well?</HI>—</L>
<L>So down he took his hams and bacon flitches,</L>
<L>Resolv'd to fill the place with other riches:</L>
<L>From every hole and cranny brush'd the soot,</L>
<L>And fix'd up shelves throughout the crazy hut:</L>
<L>A counter, too, most cunningly was plann'd</L>
<L>Behind whose breast-work none but he might stand,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="027019_0004_0FD330376793F158"/>Excepting now and then (by special grace)</L>
<L>Some brother merchant from some other place—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now, muster'd up his cash, and said his prayers,</L>
<L>In Sunday suit he rigs himself for town.</L>
<L>Two raw-bon'd steeds (design'd for great affairs)</L>
<L>Are to the waggon hitch'd, old Bay and Brown;</L>
<L>Who ne'er had been, before, a league from home,</L>
<L>But now are doom'd full many a mile to roam,</L>
<L>Like merchant ships, a various freight to bring</L>
<L>Of ribbons, lawns, and many a tawdry thing.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Molasses</HI> too (blest sweet) was not forgot,</L>
<L>And island <HI>rum,</HI> that every taste delights—</L>
<L>And <HI>teas,</HI> for maid and matron, must be bought,</L>
<L>Rosin and cat-gut strings for fiddling wights—</L>
<L>But why should I his invoice here repeat?</L>
<L>'T would be like counting grains in pecks of wheat;</L>
<L>Half Europe's list was on his invoice found,</L>
<L>And all was to be bought with—<HI>forty pound</HI>!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Soon as the early dawn proclaim'd the day</L>
<L>He cock'd his hat with pins, and comb'd his hair,</L>
<L>Curious it was, and laughable, to see</L>
<L>The <HI>village-merchant</HI> mounted in his chair:</L>
<L>Shelves pil'd with lawns and linens, in his head,</L>
<L>Coatings, and stuffs, and cloths, and scarlets <HI>red</HI>—</L>
<L>All that would suit man, woman, girl, or boy,</L>
<L>Muslins, and muslinets, jeans, grograms, corduroy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Alack! said I—he little, little dreams</L>
<L>That all the cash he guards with mickle care—</L>
<L>His cash!—the mother of a thousand schemes,</L>
<L>Will hardly buy—a load of earthen ware!</L>
<L>But why should I excite the hidden tear</L>
<L>By whispering truths, ungrateful to his ear?</L>
<L>Still let him travel on, with heart elate,</L>
<L>As <HI>Disappointment never comes too late.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="027019_0005_0FD3303966295D08"/>
<L>Though woods obscure and dull perplexing ways</L>
<L>Slow and alone he urg'd the clumsy wheel;</L>
<L>Now stopping short, to let his horses graze,</L>
<L>Now treating them with straw and Indian meal:</L>
<L>At length a lofty steeple caught his eye,</L>
<L>"Higher (thought he) than ever kite did fly:—</L>
<L>"But so it is, these churchmen are so proud</L>
<L>"They ever will be tip-toe with a cloud:</L>
<L>"Bound on a sky-blue cruise, they always rig</L>
<L>"The longest steeple and the largest wig."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now safe arrived upon the pebbled way</L>
<L>Where well-born steeds the rattling coaches trail,</L>
<L>Where shops on shops are seen—and ladies gay</L>
<L>Walk, with their <HI>curtains</HI> some; and some their veil;</L>
<L>Where sons of art their various labours show,</L>
<L>And one cries, <HI>fish!</HI> and one cries, <HI>muffins, ho</HI>!</L>
<L>Amaz'd alike, the merchant and his pair</L>
<L>Of scare-crow steeds, did nothing else but stare;</L>
<L>So new was all the scene, that, smit with awe,</L>
<L>They grinn'd, and gaz'd, and gap'd at all they saw,</L>
<L>And often stopp'd, to ask at every door,</L>
<L><HI>"Sirs, can you tell us where's the cheapest store?"</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"The cheapest store! (a sly retailer said)</L>
<L>"Cheaper than cheap, <HI>guid faith,</HI> I have to sell;</L>
<L>"Here are some colour'd cloth's that never fade:</L>
<L>"No other shop can serve you half so well.</L>
<L>"Wanting some money, now, to pay my rent,</L>
<L>"I'll sell them at a loss of <HI>one per cent.</HI>—</L>
<L>"<HI>Hum-hums</HI> are here,—and muslins—what you please—</L>
<L>"Bandanas, baftas, <HI>pull-cats,</HI>—India teas</L>
<L>"Improv'd by age, and now grown very old,</L>
<L>"And given away—you may depend not sold!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lur'd by the bait the wiley trader laid,</L>
<L>He gave his steeds their mess of straw and meal,</L>
<L>Then, gazing round the shop, thus cautious, said,</L>
<L>"Well, if you sell so cheap, I think we'll deal,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="027019_0006_0FD3303A7800E230"/>"But pray remember, 'tis for <HI>goods</HI> I come</L>
<L>"For, as to <HI>pole-cats,</HI> we've enough at home:—</L>
<L>"Full <HI>forty-pounds</HI> I'am worth—and that in gold,</L>
<L>"(Enough to make a trading man look bold)</L>
<L>"Unrig your shelves, and let me take a peep;</L>
<L>"'Tis odds I leave them bare—you sell so cheap,"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The city merchant stood, with lengthen'd jaws,</L>
<L>And star'd awhile—then made this short repiy—</L>
<L>"You clear my shelves! (he said)—This shelf of gauze</L>
<L>"Is more than all your <HI>forty pounds</HI> can buy—</L>
<L>"On yonder board, whose burthen seems so small</L>
<L>"That one man's pocket might contain it all.</L>
<L>"More value lies, than you, and all your race</L>
<L>"From Adam down, did purchase or possess."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Convinc'd, he turn'd him to another street</L>
<L>Where humbler shop-men from the croud retreat:</L>
<L>Here, caught his eye coarse callicoes and crape,</L>
<L>Pipes and tobacco, ticklenburgs, and tape,</L>
<L>Pitchers and pots—of value not so high</L>
<L>But he might sell—and FORTY POUNDS would buy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some jugs, some pots, some fifty ells of tape,</L>
<L>A keg of wine, a cask of low-proof rum</L>
<L>Bung'd close—for fear the <HI>spirit</HI> should escape</L>
<L>That many a sot was waiting for at home;</L>
<L>A gross of pipes, a case of home-made gin;</L>
<L>Tea, powder, shot—small parcels he laid in;</L>
<L>Molasses too, for <HI>swichell</HI>-loving wights,</L>
<L>(<HI>Swichell,</HI> that wings dull <HI>Whaacum's</HI> boldest flights</L>
<L>When <HI>Echoed</HI> forth, the wild ideas roll,</L>
<L>Flash'd from that farthing candle, call'd his soul:)</L>
<L>All these he bought, and would have purchas'd more</L>
<L>To furnish out his Lilliputian store;</L>
<L>But cash fell short—and <HI>they</HI> who smil'd while yet</L>
<L>The cash remain'd—now took a serious fit—</L>
<L>No more the shop-girl could his talk endure</L>
<L>But, like her cat, sat sullen and demure—</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="027019_0007_0FD3303CCEB92E28"/>The dull retailer found no more to say,</L>
<L>But bow'd his head and wish'd to sneak away;</L>
<L>Leaving his house-dog <HI>now</HI> to make reply,</L>
<L>And watch the counter with a lynx's eye—</L>
<L>Our merchant took the hint; and off he went,</L>
<L>Resolv'd to sell at—<HI>twenty five per cent.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Returning far o'er many a hill and stone</L>
<L>And much in dread his earthen-ware would break</L>
<L>Thoughtful he rode, and uttering many a groan</L>
<L>Lest at some worm-hole vent his cask should leak—</L>
<L>His cask, that held the joys of rural squire,</L>
<L>Which even ('twas said) the parson did admire,</L>
<L>And valued more than all the dusty pages</L>
<L>That Calvin writ, and fifty other sages;—</L>
<L>Once highly priz'd—be prais'd in verse and prose,</L>
<L>But now unthumb'd, <HI>enjoy a safe repose.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At dusk of eve he reach'd his old abode</L>
<L>Around him quick his anxious townsmen came</L>
<L>One ask'd what luck had happ'd him on the road,</L>
<L>And one ungeer'd the mud-bespattered team:</L>
<L>While on his casks each glanc'd a loving eye,</L>
<L>Patient, to all he gave a brief reply—</L>
<L>Told all that had befall'n him on the way,</L>
<L>What wonders in the town detain'd his stay,—</L>
<L>"Houses as high as yonder whiteoak tree,</L>
<L>"And boats of monstrous size, that go to sea:</L>
<L>"Streets throng'd with busy folk, like swarming hive</L>
<L>"The lord knows how they all contrive to live—</L>
<L>"No ploughs I saw no hoes; no care; no charge,</L>
<L>"In fact, they all are gentlemen at large;</L>
<L>"And <HI>goods</HI> so thick on every window lie,</L>
<L>"They all seem born to sell—and none to buy."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A lack a day! on life's uncertrin road</L>
<L>How many pleagues, what evils must befal;</L>
<L>Jove has on none unmingled bliss bestow'd,</L>
<L>But disappointment is the lot of all:</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="027019_0008_0FD3304135183D48"/>Thieves rob our stores, in spite of locks and keys;</L>
<L>Cats steal our cream, and rats infest our cheese,</L>
<L>The finest coat a grease spot may assail,</L>
<L>Or Susan pin a dish-clout to its tail!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our Village Merchant (trust me) had his share</L>
<L>Of vile mishaps—for now the <HI>goods</HI> unpack'd,</L>
<L>Discover'd what might make a deacon swear,</L>
<L>Jugs, cream-pots, pipes and grog-bowls sadly crackt—</L>
<L>A general groan through all the crowd was heard</L>
<L>Most pitied him, and some his ruin fear'd:</L>
<L>Poor wight! 'twas sad to see him fret and chafe,</L>
<L>While each enquir'd—<HI>Sir, is the rum cask safe?</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Alas! even <HI>that</HI> some mischief had endur'd—</L>
<L>One rascal hoop had started, near the chine!—</L>
<L>Then curiously the bung-hole they explor'd</L>
<L>With stem of pipe, the leakage to define.—</L>
<L><HI>"Five gallons must be charg'd to loss and gain!"</HI></L>
<L>"—<HI>Five gallons!</HI>" (said the merchant) writh'd with pain—</L>
<L>"Now may the cooper never see full flask</L>
<L>"But still be driving at an empty cask—</L>
<L>"Five gallons might have mellow'd down the squire,</L>
<L>"And made the captain strut a full inch higher</L>
<L>"Five gallons might have prompted many a song,</L>
<L>"And made a frolic more than five days long—</L>
<L>"Five gallons now are lost—and, sad to think,</L>
<L>"That when they leak'd, no soul was there to drink!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now slightly treated with a proof-glass dram,</L>
<L>Each neighbour took his leave, and mov'd to bed,</L>
<L>All but the merchant!—he, with grief o'ercome,</L>
<L>Revolv'd strange notions in his scheming head—</L>
<L>"For losses, such as these, (thought he) 'tis meant</L>
<L>"That <HI>goods</HI> are sold at twenty-five per cent—</L>
<L>"(No doubt, your trading men know what is just)</L>
<L>"'Tis <HI>twenty-five times what they cost at first.</HI>"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="10" REF="027019_0009_0FD32FCEEDDE6E80"/>
<L>So rigging off his shelves by light of candle,</L>
<L>The ancient smoak-house walls began to shine:</L>
<L>Here stood his tea pots (some without a handle)—</L>
<L>A broken jar—and there a keg of wine,—</L>
<L>Pipes, many a dozen (ordered in a row)—</L>
<L>Jugs—mugs—and grog-bowls—less for <HI>sale</HI> than <HI>shew</HI>—</L>
<L>The leaky cask—replenish'd from the well,</L>
<L>Roll'd to its birth—but we no tales will tell—</L>
<L>Catching the eye in elegant display,</L>
<L>All was arrang'd, and snug, by break of day:</L>
<L>The blue-dram bottle on the counter plac'd,</L>
<L>Stood, all prepar'd for <HI>him that buys</HI> to taste—</L>
<L>Sure bait! by which the man of cash is taken,</L>
<L>As rats are caught by cheese, or scraps of bacon.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Well—strange it is that fools will still apply</L>
<L>Things to themselves, that authors never meant;</L>
<L>Each country shop-man asks me, "<HI>Is it I</HI></L>
<L><HI>On whom your rhiming ridicule is spent?</HI></L>
<L>Friends, hold your tongues—Such myriads of your race</L>
<L>Adorn Columbia's fertile, favoured climes</L>
<L>A man might rove seven years from place to place</L>
<L>Ere he would find the <HI>subject</HI> of my rhymes—</L>
<L>Perhaps in Georgia is this creature known,</L>
<L>Perhaps Rhode-Island claims him for her own:</L>
<L>And if from fancy's world this wight I drew.</L>
<L>What is the imagin'd character to you?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now, from all parts the rural people ran</L>
<L>With ready cash to buy what might be bought;</L>
<L>One went to chuse a pot, and one a pan,</L>
<L>And they that had no cash their <HI>produce</HI> brought,</L>
<L>A hog, a calf, safe halter'd by the neck,</L>
<L>Potatoes (Ireland's glory) many a peck;</L>
<L>Bacon and cheese, of real value more</L>
<L>Than India's gems, or all Potosi's ore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some questions ask'd, the folks began to stare—</L>
<L>No sole would purchase, pipe, nor pot, nor pan,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="027019_0010_0FD330441C6EB3A8"/>Each shook his head— hung back— <HI>your goods so dear!</HI></L>
<L><HI>In fact</HI> (said they) <HI>the devil's in the man</HI>"</L>
<L>"Rum ne'er shall meet my lips (said honest Sam)</L>
<L>"In shape of toddy, punch, grog, sling, or dram,"</L>
<L>"No cash of mine you'll get (said pouting Kate)</L>
<L>"While gauze is valued at so dear a rate."—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus things dragg'd on for many a tedious day,</L>
<L>No custom came, and naught but discontent</L>
<L>Gloom'd through the shop—"<HI>Well let them have their way</HI></L>
<L>(The merchant said) <HI>I'll sell at</HI> cent per cent;</L>
<L><HI>By which 'tis plain I scarce myself shall save,</HI></L>
<L><HI>For</HI> cent per cent <HI>is just the price I gave.</HI>"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Aye (said the 'squire, who still had kept his pence</L>
<L>"Now, sir, you reason like a man of sense!—</L>
<L>"<HI>Custom</HI> will now from every quarter come;</L>
<L>"In ceaseless streams shall flow the inspiring rum,</L>
<L>"Till every soul in pleasing dreams is sunk—</L>
<L>"And even our <HI>Socrates</HI>—himself—is drunk!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Soon were the shelves disburthen'd of their load;</L>
<L>In three short hours the keg of wine ran dry—</L>
<L>Swift from its source even dull molasses flow'd—</L>
<L>Each saw the rum-cask wasting with a sigh:—</L>
<L>"<HI>Here lies a worthy corpse (Sangrado</HI> said)</L>
<L>"Its debt <HI>to drunkards</HI> now, no doubt, is paid—</L>
<L>"Well—'twas a vile disease that kill'd, it fure;</L>
<L>"A quick <HI>consumption,</HI> that no art could cure!</L>
<L>"Thus shall we all, when life's vain dream is out,</L>
<L>"Be lodg'd in corners dark, or kick'd about!</L>
<L>"Time is the tapster of our race below,</L>
<L>"That turns they key, and bids the juices flow—</L>
<L>"Quitting my books, henceforth be mine the task</L>
<L>"To moralize upon this EMPTY CASK—</L>
<L>"Thank heaven, we've had the taste—so far 'twas well—</L>
<L>"And still, thro' mercy, may enjoy the smell!</L>

<HEAD>Description of his Village.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>BESIDE a stream that never yet ran dry,</L>
<L>There stands, a TOWN, not high advanced in fame;</L>
<L>Tho' few its buildings, rais'd to please the eye,</L>
<L>Still this proud title it may fairly claim;</L>
<L>A <HI>Tavern</HI> (its first requisite) is there,</L>
<L>A <HI>mill</HI> a <HI>black-smith's shop,</HI> a <HI>house of prayer.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nay, more—a little market-house is seen</L>
<L>And iron hooks where beef was never hung,</L>
<L>Nor pork, nor bacon, poultry fat or lean,</L>
<L>Pigs head, or sausage link, or bullock's tongue:</L>
<L>Look when you will, you see the vacant bench</L>
<L>No butcher seated there, no country wench.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Great aims were his, who first contriv'd this town;</L>
<L>A market he would have,—but, humbled now,</L>
<L>Sighing we see its fabrick mouldring down,</L>
<L>That only serves at night to pen the cow:</L>
<L>And hence, by way of jesting, may be said,</L>
<L>That beef is there, tho' never beef that's dead.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="13" REF="027019_0012_0FD33048EBCB8470"/>
<L>A breast the inn—a tree before the door,</L>
<L>A Printing-Office lifts its humble head,</L>
<L>Where master <HI>Type</HI> old journals doth explore</L>
<L>For news that is thro' all the village read;</L>
<L>Who, year from year, (so cruel is his lot)</L>
<L>Is author, pressman, devil—and what not?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fame says he is an odd and curious wight,</L>
<L>Fond to distraction of his native place</L>
<L>In sense not very dull nor very bright,</L>
<L>Yet shows some marks of humour in his face,</L>
<L>One who can pen an anecdote complete,</L>
<L>Or plague the parson with the mackled sheet.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Three times a week by nimble geldings drawn</L>
<L>A stage arrives but scarcely deigns to stop,</L>
<L>Unless the driver far in liquor gone</L>
<L>Has made some business for the black-smith-shop,</L>
<L>Then comes this printer's harvest-time of news,</L>
<L>Welcome alike from Christians, Turks, or Jews.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>All is not <HI>Truth</HI> ('tis said) that travellers tell—</L>
<L>So much the better for this man of news:</L>
<L>For hence, the country round that know him well,</L>
<L>Will, if he prints some lies, his lies excuse.</L>
<L>Earthquakes, and battles, shipwrecks, myriads slain—</L>
<L>If false or true—alike to him are gain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But if this motley tribe say nothing new,</L>
<L>Then many a lazy, longing look is cast</L>
<L>To watch the weary post-boy travelling through,</L>
<L>On horse's rump, his budget buckled fast;</L>
<L>With letters safe in leathern prison pent</L>
<L>And wet from press, full many a packet sent.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not Argus with his fifty pair of eyes,</L>
<L>Look'd sharper for his prey than honest TYPE</L>
<L>Explores each package, of aluring size,</L>
<L>Prepar'd to seize them with a nimble gripe,</L>
<L>Did not the post-boy watch his goods and swear</L>
<L>That village TYPE should only have his share.</L>

<L>Ask you what <HI>matter</HI> fills his various page?</L>
<L>A mere farrago 'tis of mingled things;</L>
<L>What'er is done, on madam TERRA's stage</L>
<L>He to the knowledg of his townsmen brings:</L>
<L>One while, he tells of monarchs run away;</L>
<L>And now, of witches drown'd in Buzzard's bay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some miracles he makes, and some he steals;</L>
<L>Half nature's works are giants in his eyes:</L>
<L>Much, very much, in wonderment he deals,—</L>
<L>New-Hampshire apples grown to pompkins size</L>
<L>Pompkins almost as large as country inns</L>
<L>And ladies bearing, each—three lovely twins!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He, births and deaths with cold indifference views;</L>
<L>A paragraph from him is all they claim;</L>
<L>And here the rural squire, amongst the news</L>
<L>Sees she fair record of his father's fame;</L>
<L>All that was good, minutely brought to light▪</L>
<L>All that was ill,—concealed from vulgar sight!</L>

<HEAD>THE OFFICE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>Source of the wisdom of the country round,</L>
<L>Again I turn to that poor lonely <HI>shed</HI>▪</L>
<L>Where many an author all his fame has found,</L>
<L>And wretched proofs by candle-light are read,</L>
<L>Inverted letters; left the page to grace,</L>
<L>Colons derang'd, and commas out of place.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Beneath this roof the Muses chose their home;—</L>
<L>Sad was their choice, less bookish ladies say,</L>
<L>Since from the blessed hour they deign'd to come</L>
<L>One single cob-web was not brush'd away:—</L>
<L>Fate early had pronounc'd this building's doom</L>
<L>Ne'er to be plagu'd with boonder, brush, or broom.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here, full in view, the ink-bespangled press</L>
<L>Gives to the world its children, with a groan,</L>
<L>Some born to live a month—a day—some less.</L>
<L>Some, why they live at all, not clearly known,</L>
<L><HI>All that are born must die</HI>—TYPE well knows that—</L>
<L>The <HI>almanack's</HI> his longest-living brat.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="15" REF="027019_0014_0FD3304B9AB864A0"/>
<L>Here lie the types, in curious order rang'd</L>
<L>Ready alike to imprint your prose or verse;</L>
<L>Ready to speak [their order only chang'd]</L>
<L>Creek-Indian Lingo, Dutch, or Highland erse;</L>
<L>These types have printed Erskin's <HI>Gospel Treat.</HI></L>
<L>Tom Durfy's songs, and Bunyan's works complete.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But faded are their charms—their beauty fled!</L>
<L>No more their work your nicer eyes admire;</L>
<L>Hence, from this press no courtly stuff is read</L>
<L>But almanacks and ballads for the Squire,</L>
<L>Dull paragraphs in homely language dress'd.</L>
<L>The pedlars bill, and sermons by request.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here doom'd the fortune of the press to try</L>
<L>From year to year poor TYPE his trade pursues—</L>
<L>With anxious care and circumspective eye</L>
<L>He dresses out his little sheet of news;</L>
<L>Now laughing at the world now looking grave,</L>
<L>At once the Muse's midwife—and her slave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thou, who art placed in some more favour'd spot,</L>
<L>Where spires ascend, and ships from every clime</L>
<L>Discharge their freights—despise thou not the lot</L>
<L>Of master TYPE, who here has pass'd his prime</L>
<L>At case and press has labour'd many a day</L>
<L>But now, with years, is verging to decay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He, in his time, the patriot of his town</L>
<L>With Press and Pen attack'd the royal side,</L>
<L>Did what he could to pull their Lyon down,</L>
<L>Clipp'd at his tail, and twitch'd his <HI>sacred</HI> hide.</L>
<L>Mimick'd his roarings; trod upon his toes,</L>
<L>Pelted young whelps, and tweak'd the old one's nose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Rous'd by his page, at church or Court-House read,</L>
<L>From depths of woods the willing rustics ran,</L>
<L>Now by a priest, and now some deacon led</L>
<L>With clubs and spits to guard the rights of man;</L>
<L>Lads from the spade, the pick-ax, or the plough</L>
<L>Marching afar, to fight <HI>Burgoyne</HI> or <HI>Howe.</HI></L>

<L>Where are they now?—the Village asks with grief,</L>
<L>What were their toils, their conquests, or their gains?—</L>
<L>Perhaps, they near some State-House beg relief,</L>
<L>Perhaps, they sleep on Saratoga's plains;</L>
<L>Doom'd not to live, their country to reproach</L>
<L>For seven-years pay transferr'd to Mammon's coach.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye <HI>Guardians</HI> of your country and her laws!</L>
<L>Since to the pen and press so much we owe</L>
<L>Still bid them favour freedom's sacred cause</L>
<L>From this pure source, let streams unsullied flow;</L>
<L>Hence, a new order grows from reason's plan,</L>
<L>And turns the fierce barbarian into—man.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Child of the earth, of rude materials fram'd,</L>
<L>Man always found a tyrant or a slave,</L>
<L>Fond to be honour'd, valued, rich, or fam'd</L>
<L>Roves o'er the earth, and subjugates the wave:</L>
<L>Despots and kings this restless race may share,—</L>
<L>But knowledge only makes them worth <HI>your</HI> care!</L>
