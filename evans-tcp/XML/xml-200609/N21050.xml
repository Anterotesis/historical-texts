<HEAD>NEW SONG, Sung by Mr. Darby, jun. in the Pantomimical Dance, called The Sailor's Landlady. WORDS BY MRS. ROWSON. MUSIC BY MR. REINAGLE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>HOW blest the life a sailor leads,</L>
<L>From clime to clime still ranging,</L>
<L>For as the calm the storm succeeds,</L>
<L>The scene delights by changing.</L>
<L>When tempests howl along the main,</L>
<L>Some object will remind us,</L>
<L>And cheer, with hopes to meet again,</L>
<L>The friends we left behind us.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>CHORUS.</HEAD>
<L>For, under snug sail, we laugh at the gale;</L>
<L>And, tho' landsmen look pale, never heed 'em;</L>
<L>But toss off the glass, to a favourite lass,</L>
<L>To America, commerce, and freedom.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And when arriv'd in sight of land,</L>
<L>Or safe in port rejoicing,</L>
<L>Our ship we moor, our sails we hand,</L>
<L>Whilst out the boat is hoisting.</L>
<L>With chearful hearts the shore we reach;</L>
<L>Our friends, delighted, greet us;</L>
<L>And tripping lightly o'er the beach,</L>
<L>The pretty lasses meet us.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>CHORUS.</HEAD>
<L>When the full flowing bowl enlivens the soul,</L>
<L>To foot it we merrily lead 'em;</L>
<L>And each bonny lass will drink off her glass,</L>
<L>To America, commerce, and freedom.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our prizes sold, the chink we share,</L>
<L>And gladly we receive it;</L>
<L>And when we meet a brother tar</L>
<L>That wants, we freely give it:</L>
<L>No free-born sailor yet had store,</L>
<L>But chearfully would lend it:</L>
<L>And when 'tis gone, to sea for more;</L>
<L>We earn it, but to spend it.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>CHORUS.</HEAD>
<L>Then drink round, my boys; 'tis the first of our joys</L>
<L>To relieve the distress'd, clothe, and feed 'em;</L>
<L>'Tis a duty we share, with the brave and the fair,</L>
<L>In this land of commerce and freedom.</L>
