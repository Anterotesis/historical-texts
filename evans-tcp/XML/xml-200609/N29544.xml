<HEAD>His Excellency, The Earl of BELLOMONT'S SPEECH TO THE General Assembly of His Majesties Province, Conven'd at <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> on Munday,
<DATE><HI>August</HI> 7. 1699.</DATE></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have Call'd you together at this time to give you an Op∣portunity of Serving the Common Interest of your Country, by Redressing the Grievances this Province lies under, and of making such Laws, as may by the Blessing of God, Esta∣blish you in safety and happiness for the time to come.</P>
<P>I am very sensible of the great Sufferings you sustained all this last War, by this Province's being a Frontier towards the Eastern Indians, a cruel and perfidious Enemy in their own nature, but taught and incouraged to be more so by the Jesuits, and other Popish Missionaries from <HI>France,</HI> who were not more industrious during the War, to instigate their Indian Disciples, and Prose∣lytes (as they are pleas'd to call 'em) to Kill your people trea∣cherously, than they have been since the Peace, to debauch those Indians from their former Subjection to the Crown of <HI>England</HI>: Insomuch as at present they seem to have departed from their Allegiance to the Crown, and Revolted to the <HI>French.</HI> I have taken such measures as quickly to find out whether those In∣dians will return to their Obedience to the Crown or no: if they do not, and that they Commit any Hostilities upon you; I doubt not but to find an easy way of subduing them.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="039348_0002_10141E80969CE508"/>Upon the Report of His Majesties Engineer, whom I sent to view the Fort on the Great Island, and the Harbour of this Town, I find the Scituation is naturally well dispos'd, but the Fort so very weak and untenable, that it requires the Building a new substantial one, to secure you in time of War. You will do well to take this matter into Consideration as soon as may be. This Province is well Seated for Trade, and your Har∣bour here on <HI>Piscataqua</HI> River so <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> good that a Fort to secure it would invite people to come and settle among you, and as you grow in number, so will your Trade advance and flou∣rish: and you will be useful to <HI>England,</HI> which you ought to covet above all things, not only as it is your duty, but as it will also be for your Glory and Interest. Such a KING as GOD has bless'd us with at present, and such a Nation as that of <HI>England</HI> ought to excite in us a noble ambition to be reli∣giously faithful to the First, and zealously subservient to the Interest of the Latter.</P>
<P>I Recommend to you Gentlemen of the House of Repre∣sentatives, the providing for the necessary Support of the Go∣vernment, you being best able to judge what the Charge will be, and it belonging to you of right to provide the means to defray that Charge.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>You will do well to think of every thing that may conduce to your own happiness and advantage <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> you may depend <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> you, for I have all the disposition imaginable to do the KING and this Country the best Service I am Capable of.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Ordered by the House of Representatives, that His Excellency's Speech be Printed. <HI>Samuel Penhallow,</HI> Speaker.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
