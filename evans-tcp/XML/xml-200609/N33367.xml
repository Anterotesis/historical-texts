<HEAD>DESCRIPTION OF THE SUFFERINGS OF THOSE WHO WERE ON BOARD THE JERSEY AND OTHER PRISON SHIPS IN THE HARBOUR OF NEW-YORK, DURING THE STRUGGLE FOR OUR GLORIOUS INDEPENDENCE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY AN AMERICAN who was a Prisoner on board of one of them.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>The various horrors of these HULKS to tell,</L>
<L>These PRISON SHIPS where pain and penance dwell,</L>
<L>Where death in tenfold vengeance hold his reign,</L>
<L>And injur'd ghosts, yet unaveng'd complain.</L>
<L>This be my task, ungenerous BRITAINS you</L>
<L>Conspire to murder whom you can't subdue.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Two HULKS on Hudson's <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> bosom lie,</L>
<L>Two on the <HI>East</HI> alarm the pitying eye;</L>
<L>There the black SCORPION at her mooring rides,</L>
<L>There STROMBOLO swings, yielding to the tides;</L>
<L>Here, bulky JERSEY fills a larger space</L>
<L>And HUNTER, to all hospitals disgrace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'No masts or sails these <HI>crowded</HI> ships adorn,</L>
<L>Dismal to view, neglected and forlorn:</L>
<L>Here mighty ills oppressed the imprison'd throng,</L>
<L>Dull were our slumbers and our nights were long.—</L>
<L>From morn to eve along the decks we lay,</L>
<L>Scorch'd into fevers by the solar ray;</L>
<L>No friendly <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ning</HI> cast a welcome shade,</L>
<L>Once was it promis'd and was never made;</L>
<L>No favours could these sons of death bestow,</L>
<L>'T was endless vengeance and unceasing woe.</L>
<L>Immortal hatred does their breasts engage</L>
<L>And this lost empire swells their souls with rage.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thou <HI>Scorpion,</HI> fatal to thy crowded throng;</L>
<L>Dire <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of horror and Plutonian song,</L>
<L>Requir'st my lay—thy sultry decks I know,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></L>
<L>The briny wave that Hudsons bosom fills,</L>
<L>Dripp'd through her bottom in a thousand rills:</L>
<L>Rotten and old, replete with sighs and groans,</L>
<L>Scarce on the waters she sustain'd her bones;</L>
<L>Here, doom'd to toil, or founder in the tide,</L>
<L>At the moist pumps incessantly we ply'd,</L>
<L>Here, doom'd to starve, like famish'd dogs, we tore</L>
<L>The scant allowance, that our tyrants bore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Remembrance shudders at this scene of fears—</L>
<L>Still in my view some tyrant chief appears,</L>
<L>Some base born Hessian slave walks threatening by,</L>
<L>Some <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Scot, with murder in his eye,</L>
<L>Still haunts my sight as vainly they bemoan</L>
<L><HI>Rebellions</HI> manag'd so unlike their own!</L>
<L>O may I never feel the poignant pain</L>
<L>To live subjected to such fiends again,</L>
<L><HI>Stewards</HI> and <HI>Mates,</HI> that hostile Britain bore,</L>
<L>Cut from the gallows on their native shore;</L>
<L>Their ghastly looks and vengeance-beaming eyes</L>
<L>Still to my view in dismal visions rise—</L>
<L>O may I ne'er review these dire abodes,</L>
<L>These piles for slaughter, floating on the floods,—</L>
<L>And you, that o'er the troubled ocean go,</L>
<L>Strike not your standards to this venom'd foe,</L>
<L>Better the greedy wave should swallow all,</L>
<L>Better to meet the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> conducting ball,</L>
<L>Better to sleep on ocean's <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> bed,</L>
<L>At once destroy'd and number'd with the dead,</L>
<L>Then thus to perish in the face of day</L>
<L>Where twice ten thousand deaths one death delay</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When to the ocean sinks the western sun,</L>
<L>And the sco<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch'd Torie<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fire their evening gun,</L>
<L>"Down, rebels, down!" the angry Scotchmen cry,</L>
<L>"Base dogs, desc<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d, or by our broad swords die!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hail dark abode! what can with the compare—</L>
<L>Heat, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ness, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, death, and stagnant air—</L>
<L>Pandor<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> box, from whence all mischiefs flew,</L>
<L>Here real found, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ments mankind anew!—</L>
<L>Swift from the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> decks we rush'd along,</L>
<L>And vainly <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, so vast our throng;</L>
<L>Three hundred wretches here, denied all light,</L>
<L>In crowded <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pass the infernal night,</L>
<L>Some for a bed their tatter'd vestments join,</L>
<L>And some on <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and some on floors recline;</L>
<L>Shut from the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> air</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we lay with mingled corpses there,</L>
<L>Meagre and wa<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and scorch'd with heat, below,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> like ghosts, ere death had made us so—</L>
<L>How could we <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, where heat and hunger join'd</L>
<L>Thus to debase <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> body and the mind,—</L>
<L>Where cruel thir<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the patching throat invades,</L>
<L>Dries up the man, and fits him for the shades.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No waters laded from the bubbling spring</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> these dire ships these little tyrants bring—</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> p<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nk and ponderous beams completely wall'd</L>
<L>In vain for water and in vain we call'd—</L>
<L>No <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was granted to the midnight prayer,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>rebels</HI> in these regions of despair!</L>
<L>The loathsome c<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sk a deadly dose contains,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> poison <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> through the languid veins;</L>
<L>"Here, <HI>generous,</HI> Britons, generous, as you say,</L>

<L>"Nor one tormentor like your <HI>David <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>"</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Dull flew the hours till from the east display'd,</L>
<L>Sweet morn dispell'd the horrors of the shade;</L>
<L>On every side di<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e objects meet the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ght.</L>
<L>And pall<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d forms and murders of the night.</L>
<L>The dead were past their pain! the living groan,</L>
<L>Nor dare to hope another morn their own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Hunger and thirst to work our woe, combine,</L>
<L>And mouldy br<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d, and flesh of rotten swine.</L>
<L>The mangled carcase and the batter'd brain,</L>
<L>The doctor's poison, and the captain's cane.</L>
<L>The soldier's <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>squet, and the steward's debt,</L>
<L>The ev'ning shackle and the noon-day threat.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'While yet they deign'd that healthsome balm to lade</L>
<L>The <HI>putrid water</HI> felt its powerful aid.</L>
<L>But when refused to aggravate<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> our pains,</L>
<L>Then fevers rag'd and revel'd through our veins,</L>
<L>Throughout my frame I felt its deadly heat,</L>
<L>I felt my pulse with quicker motions beat:</L>
<L>A pallid hue o'er every face was spread,</L>
<L>Unusual pains attack<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the fainting head;</L>
<L>No physic here, no doctor to assist,</L>
<L>With oaths they plac'd <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on the sick man's list.</L>
<L>Twelve wretches mo<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the same dark symptoms took,</L>
<L>And these were enter'd on the doctor's book;</L>
<L>The loathsome HUNTER was our destin'd place,</L>
<L>The HUNTER to all hospitals disgrace.</L>
<L>With soldiers sent to guard us on our road,</L>
<L>Joyful we le<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dire abode.</L>
<L>Some tears we shed for <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> remaining crew,</L>
<L>Then curs'd the HULK, and from her <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ides withdrew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now tow'rds the HUNTER's gloomy decks we came,</L>
<L>A slaughter house, yet <HI>hospital</HI> in name;</L>
<L>For none came there, 'till ruin'd with their fees,</L>
<L>And half consum'd, and dying of disease;—</L>
<L>But when too near, with labouring oars we ply'd</L>
<L>The <HI>Mate,</HI> with curses, drove us from the side;</L>
<L>That wretch who, banish'd from the navy crew,</L>
<L>Grown old in blood, did here his trade renew,</L>
<L>His rancorous tongue, when on his <HI>charge</HI> let loose,</L>
<L>Utter'd reproaches, scandal, and abuse,</L>
<L>Gave all to hell, who <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> disown,</L>
<L>An<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wore mankind <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>George</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</L>
<L>A <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ousand times, to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> woe,</L>
<L>He <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ish'd us founder'd <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the gulph below;</L>
<L>A thousand times, he brandish'd high his stick,</L>
<L>And swore as often that we were not sick—</L>
<L>And yet so pale!—that we were thought by some</L>
<L>A freight of ghosts from <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eath's dominions come—</L>
<L>But calm'd at length—<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> who can always rage,</L>
<L>Or the fierce war of boundless passion wage,</L>
<L>He pointed to the stairs that led below</L>
<L>To damps, disease, and varied shapes of woe—</L>
<L>Down to the gloom I took my pensive way,</L>
<L>Along the decks the dying captives lay;</L>
<L>Some struck with madness some with scurvy pain'd,</L>
<L>But still of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fevers most complain'd!</L>
<L>On the hard <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> these <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> objects laid,</L>
<L>There toss'd and tumbled <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the dismal shade,</L>
<L>There no soft voice their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itter <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> bemoan'd,</L>
<L>And death trode stately, while the victims groan'd;</L>
<L>Of leaky deck<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I heard them long complain,</L>
<L>D<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>own'd as they were in deluges of rain,</L>
<L>Deny'd the comforts of a dying bed,</L>
<L>And not a pillow to support the head—</L>
<L>How could they else but pi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and grieve, and sigh,</L>
<L>Detest a wretched life—and wish to die.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Scarce had I mingled with this dismal band</L>
<L>When a thin victim seiz'd me by the hand</L>
<L>"And art thou come," (death heavy on his eyes)</L>
<L>"And art thou come to those abodes,—(he cries;)</L>
<L>Why didst thou leave the <HI>Scorpion's</HI> dark retreat,</L>
<L>And hither haste, a surer death to meet?</L>
<L>Why didst thou leave thy damp infected cell—</L>
<L>If <HI>that</HI> was purgatory, this is hell,</L>
<L>We, too, grown weary of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> shade</L>
<L>Petition'd early for the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>;</L>
<L>His aid denied, more <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> came,</L>
<L>Weak, and yet weaker, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> vital flame;</L>
<L>And when disease had <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> so low</L>
<L>That few could tell if we were ghosts, or no,</L>
<L>And all asserted death would be our fate—</L>
<L>Then to the doctor we were sent—too late.</L>
<L>Here wastes away <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> the brave,</L>
<L>Here young <HI>Palemon</HI> finds a watery grave,</L>
<L>Here lov'd <HI>Aleander,</HI> now <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as! no more,</L>
<L>Dies, far sequester'd from <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s native shore;</L>
<L>He late, perhaps, too eager for the fray,</L>
<L>Chac'd the proud Briton o'er the watery way,</L>
<L>'Till fortune, jealous, bade <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> clouds appear,</L>
<L>Turn'd hostile to his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame, and brought him <HI>here.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus do our warriors, this our heroes fall,</L>
<L>Imprison'd here, sure ruin meets them all,</L>
<L>Or, sent afar to Britain's barbarous shore,</L>
<L>There pine neglected, and return no more.—</L>
<L>Ah rest in peace, each injur'd, parted shade,</L>
<L>By cruel hands in death's dark weeds array'd."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'From Brooklyn heigh<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Hessian doctor came,</L>
<L>Not great his skill, nor greater much his fame!</L>
<L>Fair science never call'd the wretch her son,</L>
<L>And Art disdain'd the stupid man to own!</L>
<L>Yet still he put his genius to the rack,</L>
<L>And, as you may suppose, was own'd a QUACK.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'He on his charge the healing work begun,</L>
<L>With <HI>antimonial</HI> mixtures by <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he tun,</L>
<L><HI>Ten minutes</HI> was the time he deign'd to stay,</L>
<L>The time of grace allotted once a day,</L>
<L>He drench'd us well with bitter draughts tis true,</L>
<L>Nostrums from hell, and cortex from Peru.</L>
<L>Some with his pills he sent to Pluto's reign,</L>
<L>And some he blister'd with his <HI>sties of Spain;</HI></L>
<L>His tartar doses walked their deadly round,</L>
<L>Till the lean patient at the potion frown'd</L>
<L>And swore that hemlock, death, or what you will,</L>
<L>Were nonsense to the drugs that stuff'd his bill.</L>
<L>On those refusing he bestow'd a kick,</L>
<L>Or <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> vengeance with his walking stick.</L>
<L>Here uncontroul'd he exercis'd his trade,</L>
<L>And grew experienc'd by the deaths he made;</L>
<L>By frequent blows we from his cane endur'd,</L>
<L>He kill'd at least, as many as he cur'd.</L>
<L>On our lost comrades built his future fame,</L>
<L>And scatter'd fate where'er his footsteps came;</L>
<L>Some did not bend submissive to his skill,</L>
<L>And swore he mingled poison with his pill.</L>
<L>But I acquit him by a fair confession</L>
<L>He was no Myrmidon—he was a Hessian.</L>
<L>Although a dunce he had some sense of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></L>
<L>Or else the Lord knows where we now had been;</L>
<L>No doubt in that far country sent to range</L>
<L>Where never prisoner meets with an exchange.—</L>
<L>No centries stand to guard the midnight post,</L>
<L><HI>Nor <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eal down hatch-ways on a crowd of ghosts.</HI></L>
<L>Knave though he was, yet candour must confess,</L>
<L>Not chief physician was this man of Hesse.</L>
<L>One master o'er the murdering tribe was plac'd,</L>
<L>By him the rest were honour'd or disgrac'd,</L>
<L>Once, and but once, by some strange <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</L>
<L>He came to see the dying and the dead;</L>
<L>He came; but <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> deform'd his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</L>
<L>And such a faulchion glitter'd on his thigh</L>
<L>And such a gloom his visage darken'd o'er,</L>
<L>And two such pistols in his hands he bore,</L>
<L>That by the Gods! with such a load of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</L>
<L>He came we thought to murder, not to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</L>
<L>Rage in his heart, and mischief in his head,</L>
<L>He gloom'd destruction—and had smote <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dead;</L>
<L>Had he so dar'd—but fear withheld his hand,</L>
<L>He came—blasphem'd and turn'd again to land.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From this poor vessel, and her sickly crew</L>
<L>A British seaman all his titles drew,</L>
<L>Captain, esquire, commander, too, in chief,</L>
<L>And hence he gain'd his bread, and hence his beef,</L>
<L>But, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, you might have search'd creation round</L>
<L>And such another russian not have found—</L>
<L>Though unprovok'd, an angry face he bore,</L>
<L>All were astonish'd at the oaths he swore;</L>
<L>He swore, till every prisoner stood aghast,</L>
<L>And thought him Satan in a brimstone blast;</L>
<L>He wish'd us banish'd from the public light,</L>
<L>He wish'd us shrouded in perpetual night!</L>
<L>That were <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> king, no mercy would he show,</L>
<L>But drive all <HI>rebels</HI> to the world below;</L>
<L>That if we <HI>scoundrels</HI> did not scrub the decks</L>
<L>His staff should break our base <HI>rebellious</HI> necks;—</L>
<L>He swore, besides, that should the ship take fire</L>
<L>We too must in the pitchy flames expire;</L>
<L>And meant it so—this tyrant, I engage,</L>
<L>Had lost his life, to gratify his rage.—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If where he walk'd a murdered carcase lay,</L>
<L>Still dreadful was the language of the day—</L>
<L>He call'd us dogs, and would have held us so,</L>
<L>But terror check'd the meditated blow,</L>
<L>Of vengeance, from our injur'd nation due</L>
<L>To him, and all the base unmanly crew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such food they sent, to make complete our woes,</L>
<L>It look'd like carrion torn from hungry crows.</L>
<L>Such vermin vile on every joint were seen,</L>
<L>So black, corrupted, mortified, and lean,</L>
<L>That once we try'd to move our flinty chief.</L>
<L>And thus address'd him, holding up the beef;</L>
