<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lowing local piece (The Disappointment, or, the Force of Credulity,) was originally written for the amuse∣ment of myself and a few of my particular friends, who were pleased to signify their approbation of it in such a manner, as to en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ross a considerable part of the conversation of all ranks of people, who expressed their desire to see it and have it publish∣ed.—Under these circumstances, I was greatly at a loss how to proceed, (as I could discover little merit in it and never intended it for the press) I was loth to expose it to the criticisms of cri∣tics in dramatic or scholastic knowledge, to ridicule my ignorance, or condescend to those, who I thought were no better judges than myself, and who might, perhaps, out of compliment, or flattery to me, or to gratify their own de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>es, have represented it in a more favourable light than it really deserves.—Conscious therefore of its insufficiency, I determined to excuse myself to all, and in this determination persisted for some time, till at length wearied out with fresh and repeated solicitations I was obliged to surrender on the following stipulations.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The infrequency of dramatic compositions in America.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The necessity of contributing to the entertainment of the city.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. To put a stop (if possible) to the foolish and pernicious practice of searching after supposed hidden treasure.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Many people to this day, are possessed with a foolish notion of the Pirates burying money along the river-side, and are so infatuated with the hopes of obtaining it, that they neglect their business by day with the thoughts of it, by which means their families suffer, and at night, like so many m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>schievous musk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ats, spoil the meadows and banks to the very great injury of their respective owners.</NOTE></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>These terms, I have with reluctance been forced to submit for I am therefore obliged to assure the public, that the story is founded on fact, transacted near this city not long since and re∣cent in the memory of thousands, and for the truth of which I appeal to my fellow citizens.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="030036_0005_0FE40B48C0619860"/>But in order to give strangers, and others unacquainted with the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ory, some idea of it, the following short history is thought necessary.</P>
<P>The scheme was planned by four humorous gentlemen, Hum, Parchment▪ Quadrant, and Rattletrap, to divert them∣sel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, and friends and to try what lengths credulity and the love of money would carry me▪—</P>
<P>In order to put their scheme in execution they framed a plau∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ble, well connected, story of hidden treasure, and to gloss the matter, adapted sundry papers to their purpose and pitched upon two suitable old fellows▪ Washball and Raccoon (as principal dupes, with others, who had all been at times on seve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al digging ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ursions) to try the success of their scheme, and put (if possible) a final stop to such ridiculous practices in future, which had the desired effect. The moral shews the folly of an over cre∣dulity and desire of money, and how apt men are (especially old men) to be unwarily drawn into such schemes, where there is but a shadow of gain, and concludes with love and virtue well rewarded, and these observations, that mankind ought to be con∣tented with their respective stations, to follow their different vocations with honesty and industry, the only sure and reputable way to gain riches.</P>
<P>I do not figure to myself the least advantage accruing from it but the satisfaction of contributing my m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te to stop the current of such folly.—Such as it is, I submit to the public for their sanc∣tion or condemnation, and should any merit appear in the per∣formance, I shall not vainly attribute it to myself, but place it to the credit of mere chance.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<L>THO' distant far, from fam'd Britannia's isle.</L>
<L>Where comic scenes call cynics forth to smile.</L>
<L>Our artless muse, hath made her first essay▪</L>
<L>T' instruct and please you with a modern play.</L>
<L>Theatric bus'ness was, and still should be</L>
<L>To point out vice in its deformity;</L>
<L>Make virtue fair! shine eminently bright,</L>
<L>Rapture the breast and captivate the sight!</L>
<L>No matter which, the pulpit or the stage,</L>
<L>Condemn the vice and folly of the age;</L>
<L>These are our boast and on sure ground we stand</L>
<L>Plead virtue's cause, throughout this infant land.</L>
<L>We mount the stage and lend an helping hand.</L>
<L>Wits, fools, a knave and conjuror to night,</L>
<L>The objects make both of your ears and sight,</L>
<L>A band of dupes are humm'd with idle schemes▪</L>
<L>Quit solid sense for any golden dreams,</L>
<L>Who boldly venture on enchanted ground,</L>
<L>And dig in mystic mud, no treasure found,</L>
<L>Still fondly hope, to plunder that old thief</L>
<L>BLACKBEARD! who plunder'd thousands, pirate chief!</L>
<L>Till disappointed, tho' they labour'd hard</L>
<L>For shadows, stones, and anguish, their reward!</L>
<L>Our flatt'ring muse thinks she's some merit gain'd</L>
<L>Pursuing truth and things like truth, well feign'd.</L>
<L>The subject suited to our present times,</L>
<L>No person's touch'd, altho' she lash their crimes;</L>
<L>Nor gall, nor venom tincture her design,</L>
<L>But gay good humour, breathe in ev'ry line.</L>
<L>If you condemn her,—she for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ensure stands;</L>
<L>But if applaud!—then thund'ring clap your hands!</L>

<P>Very good,—so far we have sailed propitiously, and I have not been idle, for I've drawn in Buckram, Trushoop, and Trowell, they are perpetually at my house—I can scarce do a stroke of work for one or other of them—I wish the matter spee∣dily settled, for faith! they're so elevated, I'm affraid they'll run crazy. He, he, he! Trushoop talks of building a chappel at his own expence and of employing a score or two of priests to keep up a continual rotation of prayers for the repose of the souls of those poor fellows who buried the money, As for Buckram he intends to knock off bus'ness, go to London and purchase a title.

<P>Very good! What do you think? Ha! ha! I just now saw brother Raccoon, with a long catalogue of all his military achievements, both in Jamaica and on the Continent, together with a Treatise he wrote on Tactics, last war, for the instruction not only of our militia, but the regular officers likewise. The same he exhibited in the Coffee-house—you remember it—I cou'd scarcely refrain from laughing, while he was so earnest in explaining to me de hollow square, and de ebolutions, as he call'd 'em. He's gone in great haste, to lay 'em before the Governor, to procure his recommendation to the Secretary at War, for a Kurnel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s Commission, as he term'd it.

<P>I can't bear the thoughts of dividing, not I! division! why I cou'd never learn it at school! but, addition and multiplication, were always my darlings!

I can count a hundred as fast as any of 'em, and they can't cheat me! Charity begins at home, and he must be the greatest fool on earth, that cheats himself; I never could forgive my self for such a sin as that, I think I am old enough to have more wit. He that cheats another, can wipe off the sin, by restoring four-fold, but he that cheats himself; poor soul! the sin will lie at his own door, and it will never be in his power to make himself restitution! no, no, I know better; that must be the crying, that is spoken of by Lazarus, Nicodemus, Judas, or some other prophet, I forget who now; alack! its many years ago, since I read the bible, no matter.
