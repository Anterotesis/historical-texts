<HEAD>Barlow's Letter. From the CONNECTICUT COURANT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Messrs.</HI> HUDSON &amp; GOODWIN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE inclosed pamphlet was printed at <HI>Matthew Ly<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'s</HI> p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s in Fairhaven. He entitles it "Copy of a Letter from an <HI>Ameri∣can Diplomatic</HI> Character in France to a member of Congress in Philadelphia." Some of the most offensive parts of this letter were recited in the indictment of Lyon, the pub∣lishing of which (i. e. the reading the whole letter to large collections of people in a great many towers in his district, drawn together for the purpo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e) was the subject of the <HI>se∣cond</HI> count, and the "printing" it of the <HI>third</HI> count in the indictment.—[The sub∣ject of the <HI>first</HI> count was a letter from Lyon to Mr. Spooner, the printer of the Windsor paper.]</P>
<P>Lyon told the court that the first knowledge he had of it was hearing general <HI>Mason,</HI> a senator from Virginia, read it to a number of gentlemen in Philadelphia last summer; that he applied to Mr. <HI>Baldwin,</HI> to whom it was addressed, for liberty to take a copy it, to which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e consented, upon condition that Lyon should shew it to his friends in Ver∣mont, particularly governor Robinson and general Bradley, but not to suffer any co∣pies of it to be taken, nor to have it printed, to which Lyon said he solemnly agreed.— How he came to <HI>print</HI> it in fact, however, in violation of his "solemn agreement," he did not inform the court.</P>
<P>Several gentlemen who have seen it, and who are acquainted with Mr. Barlow, have expressed their decided opinions that he never wrote it. The public may rest assured, how∣ever, that the thing, infamous as it is, was really written by <HI>Joel Barlow,</HI> and sent by the hand of a Mr. <HI>Lee</HI> to <HI>Abraham Baldwin.</HI> The most indisputable testimony of the fact can be laid before the public if necessary.— Those who recollect what Mr. Barlow <HI>once was</HI>—those who <HI>once</HI> respected and loved him for his amiable dispositions, his talents, and his supposed pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty, will exclaim "O! how fallen!" They will discover new evi∣dence, if possible, of the accursed demoralizing powers of that modern French philosophy which has made of Europe a charnel house, and which Mr Barlow has been long known to have embraced with enthusiastic ardor. But who could have expected from <HI>him</HI> such displays of hatred to his native country!— Who could expect that Joel Barlow would have become the slanderer of WASHINGTON and ADAMS! The true lover of his coun∣try will mourn that so many of her children a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> become her most unnatural foes, and aim with parricidal aim, the fatal dagger at her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. I supply the names, "Lee," "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>," "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>," on the authority of the gentleman who enables me to assert the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the letter—they were left blanks in the pamphlet.</P>

<P>The misunderstanding between the two Governments has become extremely alarm∣ing—Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> completely destroyed.— Mistrusts, Jealousy, and a disposition to a wrong attribution of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are so appa∣rent, as to require the utmost caution in every word and action that are to come from your Executive: I mean if your object is to avoid hostilities. Had this truth been understood with you before the recal of <HI>Mun∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>,</HI> before the coming and second coming of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; had it guided the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n that wrote the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> speech of your President, and stupid answer of your Senate, at the opening of Congress in November last, I should pro∣bably have had no occasion to address you this letter.</P>
<P>To point out a remedy for the evil at it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> present <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ght, if indeed a remedy can be found, it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> necessary to call to mind the cau∣se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that have produced it; for these causes are many; and some of the operative ones are generally overlooked by the most atten∣tive observer, on your side the water—that act of submission to the British government, commonly called Jay's treaty, is usually con∣sidered both by its friends and enemies as the sol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cause, or at least the great cause of the present hostile disposition of the French <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> towards the United States. This opinion i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> erroneous, other causes, and those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> public discussion, have had a much more decided effect. It is true that consid∣ering the circumstances under which the trea∣ty was made, when England was flying, and the coalition <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rumbling before the armies of Fra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce, it served to humble us in the eyes of all Europe. It is true that the manner in which it was thrust down the throats of the people of America, by the man whose mon∣strous influence formed an inexplicable con∣trast with the weakness of his political tal∣ent, has effectually humbled u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur own eyes, and has taught our citizens to pride themselves in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enunciation of national dig∣nity; it is likewise true, that as the treaty affected France, it was a serious and undis∣guised attack upon her interests; it was gi∣ving the lie to all our professions of friend∣ship and sympathy with her, in he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> distress∣ed situation, it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rrowing the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reedom of commerce, multiplying the ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>les of contraband, and throwing every a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vantage of solving the frightful problem of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>presen∣tative democracy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> that problem as already <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lved by us; our ener∣gy was praised, our wisdom ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gerated, our example quoted by them on all occasions. GEORGE WASHINGTON, a name at that time dear to liberty, was placed at the head we could throw, into the hand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of her ene∣mies; in all th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> and many other respects the treaty with England has not yet been, nor never will be censured as much as it de∣serves; it was a measure substantially hostile, and ostentatiously irritating to our best friends. But it often happens, in public as well as in private affairs, that the greatest injuries are forgiven or excused, while slighter ones, such as border on contempt, excite the most ungovernable resentment, and lead to the greatest acts of vengeance; a striking example of this has fallen under my observation in the conduct of these two re∣publics: at the moment when the old gov∣ernment of France was shaken to its founda∣tion, the new government of the United States was consolidated and was beginning its operations under the most favorable aus∣pices. A great revolution in America had completed its work, it convinced the world of the solidity of its principles, and held up to view an unexampled prospect of public happiness. A much greater revolution in France was opening its career. Its authors and conductors, though frightened at the imm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsity of the undertaking, from the task of our administration, and his election was known to be unanimous; the French theer¦fore saw in WASHINGTON, the people of the United States; they counted on his friend∣ship, they drew consolation from his suppos∣ed sympathy, while their principles were ca∣lumniated and the nation threatened with war by all the cabinets of Europe. They grew strong from a sense of danger, and they were proud of the reproaches of prin∣ces, because they were confident of the ap∣probation of the American people, the elder sons of liberty.</P>
<P>It is difficult for you to conceive to what a degree their sensibility was carried on this subject, at the beginning of the revolution; it was clear that a sensibility of such force, must be the foundation of the most extrava∣gant affection; if properly nourished, it would have beg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t a con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> without bou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds; if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, or ans<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>d with indif∣ference, it mus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> jealousy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> by the rule<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of justice, and blind to the light of truth. And w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t was the conduct of your President? <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Jeff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> your Ambassador in France, where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> talents, and republican principles, had render∣ed him exceeding dear to all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of liber∣ty. It was well known here, that his int<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on was to remain at this place during the revolution. They wished it exceedingly, be∣cause both he and they were sensible that he would be able to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nder the most essential services to both countries, by remaining in Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is during a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of such momentous ex∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tations; no one will deny, that the oc∣casion and the place, called for the first di∣plomatic talents, and the purest republican virtue that the United States could afford. <HI>Jefferson</HI> went from Paris on a short leave of absence, with a fixed determination to re∣turn as soon as possible, but the President ordered it otherwise, and the French believ∣ed it was from a disapprobation of <HI>Jefferson's</HI> attachment to the cause of liberty in France. This opinion may be hastily formed, but they were confirmed in it by the President's na∣ming to the same place, <HI>Govern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur Morris,</HI> who for two winters past, had filled Paris with invectives against every principle of li∣berty, who was previously detested by all the leaders of the revolution; who was known to be the broker, protector, and correspon∣dent of the most obnoxious emigrants. It is possible, that <HI>Washington,</HI> in suffering <HI>Jef∣ferson</HI> to return, might have acted from o∣ther motives than those of enmity to the French revolution, though no other motives appear; but his naming <HI>Morris,</HI> was an in∣sult that admits of no palliative; it is in vain to say he was ignorant of the character that this man bore in Paris: he was a wide-mouth bawle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and had been for two years the exaggerating echo of all the abuse in all Burke's pamphlets, and the worst papers in London.</P>
<P>This seene was continued here, to the a∣stonishment of all Europe for three years, his business was to mislead the President, with respect to what was going on in France, to insult the French nation and as far as possi∣ble to betray them, for it was universally be∣lieved, and I have no doubt of the fact, that after the English and Austrian ambassadors retired from Paris, <HI>Morris</HI> acted as secret a∣gent and spy for those two cabinets. A has∣ty word or action co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing from an ambassa∣dor, though malicious in itself, is not always interpreted to be the language of the govern∣ment that sent him; but a series of ostenta∣tious abuse continued for three years, be∣comes unequivocal. All Europe leagued a∣gainst liberty, considered America already in the coalition; and France would at that time have grouped you among her enemies, had it not been for several circumstance, wholly adventitious or foreign to the conduct of your cabinet.</P>
<P N="1">1. Some Americans in Paris, of character far more respectable than that of <HI>Morris,</HI> endeavored, and with a momentary su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cess, to convince the leaders here, that his con∣duct when known in America, must be dis∣approved.</P>
<P N="2">2. France was in want of the trade and provisions of the United States, both for her colonies and herself, it would therefore be inconvenient at that time to have them for enemies.</P>
<P N="3">3. The conduct of <HI>C. Genet,</HI> a subject of so much triumph to your cabinet and that of St. James's, was one of the causes that saved you from a war at that time. Genet had been sent by Brissot; Brissot was now fallen, it was for this reason that the con∣duct of Genet was disapproved, and that of the American government passed over in si∣lence, though a silence marked with resent∣ment and contempt.</P>
<P>When after every remonstrance, and a formal demand from this government your executive was pleased to remove Morris from his ostensible situation in Paris, he e∣migrated, that is, he went and joined the e∣migrants in Germany, and has been ever since among the enemies of France. But this is not all, a letter from Washington to Morris,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>We have never before heard of any such letter, and believe none such ever exi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted; it is unquestionably</HI> one <HI>of the million of ja∣cobinic lies invented with design to make our beloved WASHINGTON odious to his country∣men.</HI></NOTE> dated in the latter end of the year 1795, intercepted, and now in the hands of the directory, gives him a commission as a secret agent to the cabinet of London, to transact business so apparently hostile to the interest of France, that I am assured this let∣ter has sharpened the edge of resentment here, more than the whole of Jay's treaty. This and other circumstances have given full credit to the opinion here, that a journey which Morris took from London to Berlin, in the year 1796, was a mission on the part of the British government to engage the king of Prussia to rejoin the coalition against France. Another fact, though of less con∣sequence, could not escape the animadversi∣on of the French government. John Parish, American consul at Hamburg, was employ∣ed by the English government as their agent for transmitting the subsidies and loans, to the Emperor, and the King of Prussia, for the war against France; and to freight and fit out vessels for the transporting troops to the West-Indies. It may be said that the American government were not answerable for a thing of this sort, of which they could have no knowledge; but this has not pre∣vented the fact from being recognized among the proofs of an unfriendly disposition on your side, and certainly great allowances ought to be made for the jealousy of a na∣tion g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ded by all Europe, tormented by her own traitors, and standing alone, in a cause in which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he expected, at least a friendly countenance from us, if not an active sup∣port. She looked upon the cause of liberty as our cause; and though she did not require us to take arms, she considered herself as fighting our battles in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r own.</P>
<P>Much has be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n said on the subject of na∣tional gratitude, and to ascertain how much, or whether any was due from us to France, for the part she took in the American war. I will not add to the observations that have been made on this head, but it is clearly my opinion, that she has rendered us more solid service by establishing the principle of repre∣sentative government in Europe, than by aiding us in America.</P>
<P>I shall say very little on the mission of Monroe, because I take it for granted, from what I have heard, that he has already told his own story in print. I will only say that in the midst of all difficulties created by the madness of his predecessor, the continued fol∣ly of your Executive, the unfortunate con∣clusion and ratification of the English treaty, he conducted himself in such a manner as to form by his single character a counterpoise to all the weight of resentment from this go∣vernment; nobody doubts here, but that he would have continued to do so to the end of the war, if your cabinet had let him alone, and confined their blunders to their own continent, What must then have been the astonishment of all our friends, and the ex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ltation of the court of London, to see him recalled in the most abrupt and censorious manner.</P>
<P>For the personal qualities of Gen. Pinck∣ney, because they had little or nothing to do with his being refused here, as the successor of Monroe▪ I will excuse him for writing weak and idle letters, but I will not excuse your executive for printing them.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>We trust our Executive will</HI> try <HI>to get along without the great Mr. Barlow's excuse.</HI></NOTE> Being rejected as ambassador, he went to spend the winter in Holland; and all the world knows how many carriage wheels it cost him, to make these journies through this frightful re∣publican territory; Nothwithstanding all these evils, both real and imaginary, there still remained one more—to the patience of his very impatient gove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nment, they knew that Washington was in the dotage of his natural life, and near the close of his politi∣cal career; they indulged the hope that when he should be out of office, the American peo∣ple would come to their senses, or, at least, they saw that the character of the new Pre∣sident would be a criterion by which the de∣cided friendship or enmity of the United States would be clearly seen. The candidates were Adams and Jefferson; the one a re∣puted Royalist, and enemy to France; the other an eminent Republican, and a friend to the cause of liberty in all countries. The sentiments of these two men were not yet known here; those of the people were not yet known, because it was supposed that the general idolatry for Washington had prevent∣ed them from being freely uttered; these were the reasons why the Directory determin∣ed to take no decided step in consequence of Monroe's recal, until the public voice should decide between these two candidates. <HI>This accounts for the interest which the French seemed to take in the event of that election. Their wishing you to elect</HI> JEFFERSON, <HI>proves that they did not want to quarrel with you, and that they still hoped that the people of America were friends to liberty.</HI> The government have waited the event. This was an awful pause in the American affairs in Europe; and it is astonishing to me how you could fail to view it in that light in America, and to take the measure which the the most moderate share of common sense, and the most palpable self interest, pointed out.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>We had the unbroken <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of</HI> Indepen∣dent Americans, <HI>and dared to act in confor∣mity to it, the</HI> "diplomatic skill" <HI>of France notwithstanding.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>When the election of Adams was announ∣ced here, it produced the order of the 2d of March, which was meant to be little short of a declaration of war; but it was so far short of it as to leave room on your side to come forward with an additional project of nego∣ciation, if you wished to avoid that calam∣ity.</P>
<P>The enmity of the old President towards France, was now considered as nationalized in America, and the government here was determined to fleece you of your property, to a sufficient degree to bring you to your feel∣ing in the only nerve in which it was presum∣ed your sensibility lay, which was your pecu∣niary interest.</P>
<P>This uncomplying disposition of the Di∣rectory induced Mr. Adams to call an extra∣ordinary meeting of Congress, and conse∣quently to make a speech.</P>
<P>To a man who had the least pretensions to prudence, there were but two courses to be taken; one was to declare war if he wished to ruin his country; the other was, if he wished to save it, to offer to negociate by send∣ing some man or men that he knew would be agreeable to France; or, at least, not to play the bully, by forcing a man back, who had just been driven out of Paris. The true policy would have been, to retrieve the mis∣take of Washington, by sending back Mon∣roe. You cannot imagine the effect produc∣ed here by the name only of a known friend to liberty in America. A report prevailed here for a few days, that Madison was nam∣ed to this mission;—it almost disarmed the government of all resentment. Had the the news proved true, and Madison arrived, the business would have been settled in 24 hours.</P>
<P>But Adams to attain his object, whatever it might be, found out a third course, which discovers more invention than I supposed him to possess: he formed a commission of three to make the people of the United States believe that a negociation was offered on their part, and then filled it up with names from which there could not be the least ex∣pectation of success. The first was a man who had just been refused, and could not be offered again without an insult: sending him back, was undoubtedly intended as an insult, and it was so received: the second was a man whose effigy had been burnt in Virgi∣nia, for his violent defence of the British treaty—at least it was so reported and be∣lieved here: the third was a little <HI>make-weight</HI> man, appointed with the intention that he should have no influence:—and yet, to prove to you the facility of this govern∣ment, after all that had passed, I am able to assure you, from the best authority, that if Gerry had been sent alone, and not shackled with the other two, the directory would have negociated with him, without any difficulty; at present, the three have been here five months, without being received or rejected; and a new law is made, by which an additi∣onal number of neutral vessels will fall into the hands of the French.</P>
<P>I shall hardly gain credit with you were I to state on how small a pivot the fate of na∣tions turns in Paris at this moment.</P>
<P>The speech of John Adams, at the open∣ing of Congress in November, was waited for here with as much expectation as if peace or war depended upon it. It was hoped that after he had sent his commissioners, he would at least avoid the use of insulting lan∣guage against the nation with whom he was pretending to treat. But when we found him borrowing the language of Edmund Burke, and telling the world that, although he should succeed in treating with the French, there was no dependence to be placed on any of their engagements; that their re∣ligion and morality were at an end; that they had turned pirates and plunderers, and it would be necessary to be perpetually armed against them, though you were at peace— we wondered that the answer of both houses had not been an order to send him to a mad∣house. Instead of this, the Senate have echoed the speech with more serv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lity than ever George the third experienced from either house of Parliament. Read over the para∣graph that speaks of France; his bringing in of the word Europe, under pretence of generalizing it, is so flimsy a cover for his attack on thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> nation, that it only adds to the abuse, by attempting to impose on the understanding; he certainly could not mean the English, for he brags in the next para∣graph how well they keep their treaty. He could certainly mean nobody but the French, for no other nation have overturned religion. Had this speech borne a friendly aspect, or had the paragraph in question been similar to the one inserted in the speech of governor M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fflin, on the same subject, it would have facilitated the negociation, and probably saved millions to the United States.</P>
<P>In enumerating the causes which have brought the two republics to the brink of war, several memorable speeches in your house of representatives, must not be forgot∣ten. One of your orators calls the French government a <HI>five headed monster</HI>—another says, Barras, when he pronounced his farewell speech to Monroe, must have been drunk or mad. These gentlemen forget that Barras reads their speeches; and that the five head∣ed monster, when it shall have devoured the fry of Europe, may possibly shark them in their turn.</P>
<P>Another subject of complaint, and that not the least, is the scurrility of many of your newspapers, against the republic: among the most abusive i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES, which is considered here as an official paper, or printed under the eye and pa∣tronage of the government. The office of foreign affairs receives these papers regularly; and you cannot suppose that any of these in∣sults pass unnoticed. It is remarked here, and with great truth, that there is more dir∣ty calumny against the French in American than in the London papers.</P>
<P>But it is in vain to amuse ourselves in de∣scribing the nature of the disease, unless there be a remedy within our reach. In my opi∣nion there is one, but I have scarcely any hope that you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wise men will stumble upon it. Acknowledge your error in sending Pinckney and Marshall to this country;— recall them, and perhaps Gerry with them— name and send Madison or Monroe to take their place, and let the President in his mes∣sage to the Senate acknowledging the nomi∣nation, utter sentiments full of friendship to the French nation, government, and cause— let him acknowledge that the principles of liberty are equally dear to the two countries —and deprecate the idea of gratifying the tyrants of the world, by exhibiting the two great republics, whose existence they strove in vain to prevent, now tearing out each others vitals.</P>
<P>I perceive that much stress is laid by your President, and your other leaders, on the conduct of this Government, in refusing to receive your ambassador Pinckney. I wish those gentlem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n could some how or other be made acquainted with the following history. I hope you will not suppose, by inserting it here, my intention is to justify the French government: No, my object will be truly to serve my country, and to vindicate the ho∣honor of all the ardent spirits among you, if they should neglect this opportunity of going to war for the three broken wheels of Gen. Pinckney's carriage.</P>
<P>In the year 1796, the Swedish ambassador here, the Baron de Stahl, obtained leave of absence, and presented his secretary as charge d'affaires, who had the king's commission for that purpose. This man was refused, on which de Stahl presented a note to the mini∣ster of foreign relations, desiring him to as∣sign the reasons, that the king might know in what he had offended the republic, since he had been the first in Europe to acknow∣ledge it, and the most ardent to deserve its friendship. The answer to this note was, an order to the new charge d'affaires to quit the republic, and a recall of the French am∣bassador from Stockholm. As soon as cou∣riers could pass to Sweden and back, the mat∣ter was accommodated, by the King's re∣newing the Baron de Stahl, who was agreea∣ble to the French.</P>
<P>About the same time the Ambassador of Tuscany, while in peaceable exercise of his functions, was ordered by the government to quit Paris in 24 hours, and the republic in 8 days, without any reasons assigned. He obeyed, and the Grand Duke very com∣plaisantly sent another.</P>
<P>The ambassadors of Portugal and Rome, who were in full credence and activity a few weeks ago, are now in prison in Paris. It is true that this was in consequence of a rup∣ture between this government and each of theirs. But the fate of agents in such cases, used to be, to be sent away, and not to be imprisoned.</P>
<P>The king of Spain lately sent a new ambas∣sador here, in great pomp, who is refused, and ordered to quit the country, without reasons publicly assigned.</P>
<P>You will remark, that in this light the Spanish and Swedish are cases in point, for your Pinckney. But their poor Kings had not learned the etiquette of John Adams, to name and send back the same man who had been refused. Kings, at this day, have no notion of a rupture with France.</P>
<P>Another event has lately happened to the Baron de Stahl, which makes the Swedish case, taken altogether, different from the A∣merican. (God grant that the American may never come to it, as long as you have loving couples to send on these missions.) The wife of Baron Stahl is just sent out of the republic on a suspi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion of conspiracy; while the husband occupies his post. What would the Columbian blood <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay to this? Let <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hear none of your wicked bachelors remark, that this order was solicited by the husband; no such reason is assigned. In∣deed, had the Baron obtained the order, he ought to have obtained leave to clamor a∣gainst it afterwards; decency seemed to re∣quire it, and yet he has not done it. Had it been an American ambassador, and had the American been me, I should have tried hard to get my case inserted in a speech of John Adams, or a letter of Timothy Pickering. I repeat to you, that I am not undertaking the hopeless and useless task of vindicating all the measures that the violent convulsions of the revolution have induced this people to adopt. But when Mr. Adams shall hear of the sending away of his ambassador, I would advise him, and all those who are concerned in his wounded honor, to club that commo∣dity with the kings, princes, and states a∣bove mentioned, and to try to bear their part with a patience becoming a government that ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> merited this sort of chastisement more than all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eir fellow sufferers put together.</P>
<P>Your three commissioners will doubtless seize this occasion, by Mr. Lee, to forward their dispatches. These will probably be of a nature to induce the President to take some decisive step; and I am in trembling expec∣tation of seeing him give another desperate leap into the regions of madnes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Without knowing precisely the face that the commis∣sioners will put to the business, I will ven∣ture to affirm, that the <HI>answer propre</HI> will contribute more than its due share to the coloring. A manly and independent style of writing appears not to belong to their char∣acter.</P>
<P>Were I to write their letters to the exec∣utive, it should be in language like this. —"The French have many reasons for be∣ing offended with the American government; these reasons are exaggerated by their jea∣lousy, and other other strong passions inse∣parable from the revolution. This is an un∣favorable moment, and we are improper per∣sons, to attempt to explain away the imagi∣nary wrongs on which a great part of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> resentment is founded. We advise you to recall us three, and at the same time to re∣place us with one or more persons whose cha∣racters are well known and approved by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he French; such as Madison or Monroe. If you wish to terminate these disputes by ne∣gociation, you must be prepared for consid∣erable sacrifice; such as a loan of money similar to what this nation m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de to you last war; such as a modification of the Bri∣tish treaty, or at least a new treaty with France, giving her more advantages than that treaty gives to England. It is possible that on conditions of this kind, you may ob∣tain some indemnification for the spoilations on your commerce; somewhat in the man∣ner provided for with the English in Mr. Jay's treaty.</P>
<P>"It is scarcely necessary for us to observe that your commission, considering the dis∣tance between the two countries, must no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be straitened in its powers, as in this affair so much depends on the <HI>manne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> The Presi∣dent will excuse us if we insist on the necessi∣ty of using the utmost precaution in his pub∣lic speeches relative to this country and of the revolution, the magnanimity of the na∣tion, the sacrifices they have made in the ge∣neral cause of liberty; the French are ex∣tremely sensible on this subject."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>And if they had suffered you to write in that style, or had written to themselves, they would have dec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ved and received the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> American.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>I do not know that a letter of this kind would produce any effect with you; but I beg you to remember the warning I now give you, that if your executive is inaccessable to sentiments like these, you are very soon at war with the conquerors of Europe.</P>
<P>So much depends on the measures to be taken in consequence of the dispatches which I suppose will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>company this letter, that I could not rest easy without communicating my sentiments to some one who would be likely to make a good use of them. I was going to address them to Jefferson, or to —, but I thought they would be safest and best in the hands of my oldest and best friend.</P>
<P>You will naturally conclude, that some credit is due to my opinions, when you re∣flect that they have been formed on a close observation of every stage of the revolution, and an intimate relation with every set of leaders. The present directory are but the successors and sub-successors of my fellow-la∣borers in the days of my activity; for the political generations have passed away with such rapidity, that in every thing, but wis∣dom, I am one of the worst or best of the present race.</P>
<P>From the manner in which your present commission was composed, there is very lit∣tle doubt in my mind, and there certainly is none in the minds of the Directory, that the emb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssy was really intended for Lewis the XVIIIth. Your Executive did not foresee the 18th Fructidor. When, in God's name are we to expect any just ideas from Ameri∣ca, relative to France? Look for a Repub∣lic in England, but do not, I beseech you, look for a Monarchy in France!</P>
<P N="12">12 <HI>March</HI>—Since writing this letter, I reflect that you may be gone to Georgia be∣fore it arrives; anxious of giving it a chance of doing some good, I send a copy of the most substantial parts of it to —</P>
