<PB REF="034600_0004_0FFF13EDDDCD70B8"/>
<HEAD><HI>Introduction,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>SOMETIMES human beings are unreasonably charmed with novelty; and at other times reject that which is use∣ful and good without sufficient trial. What has appeared wrong, on account of some adventitious circumstances, has been rejected, as wrong in its own nature. This has been exactly the case with school exhibitions—They are in themselves exceedingly useful—When they are proper∣ly conducted they enlarge the ideas and polish the man∣ners of students. They show an example of moral precepts represented in real life—But by means of some injudicious attempts, the public mind seems greatly prejudiced against them. It is said
<Q>they are expensive, that they encour∣age profanity and vice; that the feelings of students are often hurt by the distribution of parts—or their parents cruelly mortified—that students acquire by them an in∣decent confidence, and that they intrude upon studies more necessary and useful than rhetoric—and they are imitations of a theatre, which is always a seminary of vice.</Q>
Yet we believe, that they may be so managed as not to be chargeable with any of these evils; but be pro∣ductive of a most innocent and rational amusement, and not only improve the outward carriage of the students; but implant the most useful morals in them; and in the minds of their friends, who attend their performances. And the design of the introduction of this work, is to show how this may be done. For perspicuity's sake I shall consid∣er myself as speaking to a person who wishes to know my sentiments of an exhibition.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I. OF GUARDING AGAINST PREJUDICES.</HEAD>
<P>IT is vain for a student, new from a university, to think of confronting the prejudices of a people by mere asser∣tions; and confidently reprobating their opinions—Man∣kind
<PB N="8" REF="034600_0005_0FFF10A45BBD5D38"/>
resent such treatment; and the prejudice is the stron∣ger from that very cause. It is best to begin with a small exhibition, and only ask to show a few pieces—Peo∣ple are afraid of what is done in the dark—for that reason get some popular person or persons to look over your pieces before exhibition, and show the utmost readiness to have them rejected if thought improper. Then tell those, who inspect your pieces, by no means to admit such as they dislike. And if there be a single word, or phrase, which offends, let it be struck out without mercy. If they should reject all but simple dialogues, be content. But exhibit them in the most advantageous manner.</P>
<P>When the audience can bear dialogues, the number of dialogists may be increased, and soon it will be found that dramas, if not in themselves offensive to religion and mor∣als, will be perfectly harmless—Adhere to the system of correcting them perfectly before they are given out to the students, by yourself and by others. Women are gen∣erally better judges of the delicacy of writings than men. —Apply then to some of the most sensible, and best edu∣cated ladies, in the town, or district, where you keep a school; and desire that they will examine your pieces, and note every passage which offends them. Such passages must all be sacrificed, and there is no loss in the case —You will probably substitute better phrases in the room of those excepted against, get a character for modesty, and acquire a purity of stile in your original compositions.</P>
<P>Do not imagine that your pieces in order to please must be calculated, to excite laughter. Those which excite the loudest peals of mirth o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ten please the least on the whole. —People often laugh at buffoonery, and when they go away from the scene, where they saw it, are angry with, and condemn themselves for being pleased, even for a mo∣ment. You may insert diverting p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ces, and it is generally best in the course of an exhibition, to have one or two that are laughable, but it is not advisable to have your pieces mostly of that cast. Those which are sublime, which waken the mind and benevolent affections▪ which excite the sentiments of piety or shew moral principles to advantage, will please all people who are not ideots or totally cor∣rupted in their mental taste. Most of the pieces performed at an exhibition should decidedly be of the useful kind▪ and those which are more diverting, should be perfectly harm∣less
<PB N="9" REF="034600_0006_0FFF13F20B9D7AF0"/>
—It is best never to descend lower than those which pro∣mote politeness and good humor.</P>
<P>Another thing should be attended to with great care. That none of the pieces be of such a nature as to bear even a plausible application to any person in the town, or dis∣trict▪ where you are, in the way of ridicule—The wounds of ridicule are incurable, and the attempt of taking off in∣dividuals, is never forgiven.—Rather drop a diverting piece, or let vice pass unpunished, than offer a direct affront to any person by an exhibition. And avoid all general satire —It can never be just—If a married man be a ridiculous character; let it be, because he abuses his wife or his chil∣dren—If an old bachelor, because he is mischievous and ill-natured—an old maid because she is vicious, and disturbs the peace of families—a lawyer for knavery—a priest for keeping low company—a merchant for cheating—is lawful prize for ridicule. But nothing that is good or useful, or even harmless should be ridiculed—And good men and women are found in all the lawful employments of life— above all things religion—marriage—and necessary and useful labor, should be exempted from ridicule.</P>
<P>Let not exhibitions be too expensive—People are gener∣ally hurt by expence, and will not long love that which draws their money from them—In some instances, bands of music have been hired, a great expence has been incurred for dresses, decorations for a stage, machines, and what not. Exhibitions can never become customary with all these appendages—They would banish themselves by the mere cost of maintaining them—Only reflect that you are at the head of a school, and are not the manager of a theatre, and you will avoid those extremes—The object of speaking in schools is, to use the student to a clear, and judicious mode of expression, and action, on all the occasions of life, and business. This may be provided for at a very small expence, as we shall show in another place.</P>
<P>Be very careful that the sentiments contained in your pieces be just and philosophically true—that they be whol∣ly purified from all prophane, obscene and low, black-guardly sentiments, and phrases—and that the phrases which express humor, as those peculiar to clowns, cits, sailors, soldiers &amp;c. be such, as will not offend persons of mod∣esty and good taste. By these means you will avoid hav∣ing a bad impression on the minds of the audience in the
<PB N="10" REF="034600_0007_0FFF10A6DBB9D2F8"/>
first and most simple performances of rhetoric, and if they be performed well it will create a desire to hear those which are more perfect till at last you may freely exhibit what∣ever is promotive of piety or morals, and be only the more approved as the performances are more complete—But we must now describe the apparatus and manner of an exhibition.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION II. OF NECESSARY PREPARATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>IT is necessary in your schoolhouse, to have a small es∣planade, or stage. If no one be made in the construction of the house you may erect a temporary one. It will be very convenient to have a room behind the stage, to which the performers can withdraw, when they should be sup∣posed absent. About this stage, on a frame erected for the purpose, you may draw curtains, to conceal the stage, oc∣casionally▪ from the audience. This will give opportunity to represent different scenes of action. Then by tables, books, &amp;c. the stage may represent a study—by national arms, and emblems &amp;c. a court—by military trophies, an encampment or field of war—by means of shackles, chains &amp;c. a prison—by handsome furniture, a gentleman's parlor—by cheap furniture, of the rural kind, a cottage or shepherd's tent &amp;c. Thus on a stage of no more than twelve feet by eight—by such judicious alterations, ef∣fects may be produced on the imagination, which are truly surprizing, if we consider the cause, and it may be done without any extraordinary expense.</P>
<P>Beside the curtains which are drawn around the stage, there should be one drawn across from side to side, which may totally hide the back-scene, and be so contrived, as to open at the end, and in the middle. Persons engaged in opposite parties, sentiments, or interests, or who are any way at variance, should enter on opposite sides of the stage. If during the representations they be not reconciled they should also depart on opposite sides, if they become friends they should go off on the same side &amp;c. while the others are performing; they, who are to follow, must remain concealed behind the back curtain, if there be no drawing
<PB N="11" REF="034600_0008_0FFF13F3A0DA4F10"/>
room behind. If there be a drawing room behind, that is properly the place for the performers who are waiting— the curtain opens in the middle to receive some grand or august character—Or opening into another room, it may represent objects at a distance—Or it may represent an action which is seen from one room into another. As in the "<HI>Orphan of China,</HI>" the opening of the curtain in the middle, and the ladies closing the door by standing close together, while the children, threatened to be kil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed by the Tartars, are behind them, produces a striking effect on the imagination and feelings of the audience. And this back curtain will be found of great use in all representations of the dramatic kind—Such an appara<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s as this will cost lit∣tle or nothing, and will be found sufficient for any thing which can be well represented by the boys and girls of a school. Being thus furnished with a stage, next it must be our care to furnish the stage with performers. Masks, dresses arms, emblems, professional implements, may easily and occasionally be procured, as they may be of use, by bor∣rowing them of the owners.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION III. OF SELECTING THE PERFORMERS.</HEAD>
<P>IT should be a capital maxim in selecting the persons to perform, that they be heartily willing for the enterprize and desirous of distinguishing themselves —Unless your superiors or employers require, never take any person who expresses reluctance to be a speaker. Such will never perform well. And be assured that the parents or guar∣dians of each student, approve of his being instructed in rhetoric, before you bestow your pains upon him. By these precautions you will not only avoid blame; but es∣cape a derangement of your exhibition after it is formed.</P>
<P>You will also have a set of lively, animated acto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>—and have them perfectly at your own command—advise the best speakers to undertake parts, but compel none—advise, if you fear having too many, the poorer speakers not to take parts—but if they be greatly desirous, accept them. And let them begin with the shorter parts, and those which require the least skill in speaking—And it may be ques∣tioned
<PB N="12" REF="034600_0009_0FFF13B999D232F0"/>
whether an exhibition appears so well, to have all the parts uniformly executed according to the strict rules of good speaking; as it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to have the principal parts, exceedingly well performed, and the under parts with less skill—Cicero observes that the Greek players who had un∣der parts purposely fell short in some degree, of what they could perform, that the principal parts might appear to greater advantage—The less able speakers may not be useless to you.</P>
<P>In this first selection by these means you will have a lively spirited corps of volunteers for your exhibition— and you will have no guardian or parent blaming you for compelling his boys or girls to speak against their wills and exposing their weakness, in case they should be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>suc∣cessful.</P>
<P>Before you distribute the parts other points are to be considered—It must not be thought that you intend to mark the foibles or vices of any of your performers in pub∣lic. Should you assign the part of a clown, to a person nat∣urally clumsy and awkward, he, and his parents, might think you meant it as a stigma upon him, or the family. Should you assign the part of a rogue, to a boy who is known to be such a character; it will give offence. And neither of the parts would be performed well; thro an un∣easy consciousness which would attend the performance. If you would escape the uneasiness of relations or discontent in your school, all assignments which would carry a pointed reflection on individuals or families must be avoided—And there are certain principles which may help you out of all difficulty.</P>
<P>Scholar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> uniformly perform best in the character which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to them, or that which is directly the opposite. When the part which is natural to any one is a good part, and represents a good, or harmless character, you may assign it to him without scruple—He will perform well because <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is in his own natural way—But the character of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ue is best performed by a very honest person, provided he understands the business of taking off characters well. The honest man's aversion to a rogue causes him to ob∣serve the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar features of the character. From which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he will strike it off in a lively manner, and feel no kind of fear lest it should be applied to himself—Also a person who when he pleases can behave very gentcelly, yet
<PB N="13" REF="034600_0010_0FFF13F531D37A58"/>
possesses a good imitative faculty best performs the char∣acter of a clown, and the best tempered girl in your school should have the part of Keensight in "The Mother of a Fam∣ily"—The part of an old maid should go to a girl in the school who is most popular among the young gentlemen— The principle is, we perform well in the character which is natural to us▪ because we are then in our own way, and we observe most the traits of that character which is most contrary to us, and therefore can counterfeit it the easiest.</P>
<P>But, as to grave and serious characters being good, they must be assigned to grave and serious persons—Merry or cheerful characters to persons of the same cast. A gen∣eral is ill personated by a palefaced boy—He should be a large man and a noble figure—A magistrate the same, when he appears in his proper character—A Lady of em∣inence should be represented by one tall, well proportion∣ed, and pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>onable—And it would be most absurd to repre∣sent a shepherdess the Venus of the groves but by a girl who is beautiful in reality.</P>
<P>And it may not be amiss in many cases to let the schol∣ars chuse the parts for themselves or draw them out by lot in case there is like to be a competition—And it may be settled also as a principle after the parts are assigned that any who please may change between themselves, if both may thereby be suited better. And to conclude this section in a few words—Endeavor to designate your per∣formers in such a manner as to have them easy and satis∣fied, and if possible let none of their friends be discontent∣ed—For it is often from the resentment of persons who think themselves hurt; that clamors have been raised against the study of rhetoric, which is by good judges tho't a necessary part of education <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a free state.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION IV. OF DISTRIBUTING THE PARTS.</HEAD>
<P>FOR the principal character in each piece you will doubtless select a speaker on whom you can depend for steadiness of temper, and complete self command—You
<PB N="14" REF="034600_0011_0FFF13BB5F660660"/>
will do the same for any persons who will perform the single pieces. If you have a single piece to begin your exhibition, let it be given to a person of great firmness. For complete coolness, and selfcommand, are in no part of an exhibition, so necessary as in the first piece that is spoken. The first piece, spoken well, gives such a spring to the spirits of the performers who are to follow; as will carry with it the most happy effects, thro the whole exhi∣bition—And in fact the first performance is the most dif∣ficult and most trying to the feelings of the performer. If it should fail it will sink the spirits of the other performers, and probably spoil the whole exhibition. For performing the last piece which should be a single one, and an epi∣logue to the whole, you should have that speaker in your school, who has the most sweet and harmonious voice, with the most easy and gentle manners, and in every view the most pleasing speaker. For this part should make the audience feel intensely, and as it was said of Pericles the Orator, should leave the sting of pleasure in the hearts of the hearers. If you have an intermediate single piece, any good and clear speaker may have it and we shall show hereafter of what advantage such a piece may be—The rest of the parts may be disposed of according to your discret∣ion. Only due regard should be had to the voice and manner of performing.—A slow mournful voice suits a melancholy part; a voice hard and sharp an angry charac∣ter, a soft and sweet voice and manners agree to a father of a family, a lover, a flatterer &amp;c. a lively sharp voice to a merry character &amp;c. but a little attention and experience is worth more than a thousand rules.</P>
<P>To avoid giving offence by distributing the parts; take notice how many performers you have, and let the single pieces be considered. Let each student who desires it have nearly as many lines to speak, as they who perform the single pieces—the least offensive way of disposing of the single pieces which are considered as most <HI>honorary</HI> because in them the whole attention of the audience is turned on the speaker—is to dispose of them in the school by <HI>ballot.</HI> Let the students ballot for the persons to perform them— while the precep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or holds a negative upon their choice in case they choose wrong—In this way all odium of partial∣ity is avoided. And let the highest candidates, who miss o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> single pieces, have the principal parts in the other per∣formances
<PB N="15" REF="034600_0012_0FFF13F805F87CF8"/>
—there is no danger in this way. A school <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill seldom choose wrong. The preceptor is never considered as in the fault. The scholars are pleased, and easy among themselves. And it is a good exercise to train them up to act the part of judicious electors in a free state. If those who must take under parts be good speakers, and desire it, give them a duplicate of parts—that is, two parts, each making up in the whole, nearly as great a number of lines as those have who have single parts or principal parts in dialogues—those who are content with short parts, leave content, and urge no more upon them.</P>
<P>As to the quality of the parts assigned, some will show the speaker to advantage, and some will not—the expres∣sion of a vicious character is generally bad—to assign an immodest or profane part to any scholar, male, or female, is wrong. There should be no such in school—such par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> as while they are performing put a modest, and conscien∣tious mind in pain, should be industriously avoided.</P>
<P>But it is necessary sometimes to represent vicious parts, else the virtuous characters would not appear to advantage. Much of the admiration of virtue depends on its being contrasted with vice—such passions as jealousy, discontent, ill humor, &amp;c. must be represented. The repre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entation of them th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not agreeable, yet is not disgusting, neither in a moderate degree does it excite horror. They may therefore make a part in a school exhibition without any impro∣priety.</P>
<P>Now as the base passions give a person a disagreeable appear∣ance, if you assign only a part which represents a scholar in a disagreeable view to the audience, you mortify the scholar, and give pain to his relations and friends. For this reason the most disagreeable parts should be assigned to those who, in the other part of the duplicate, have the most agreeable —never assign two very agreeable parts, or two very dis∣agreeable once to the same scholar but treat the parts, as Laban did his daughters; make the good ones put off the bad—two parts of middling length, or goodness, may be assigned together, or otherwise, let a good and a bad, a long and a short one, go together. By this method your scholars will be satisfied, and you will have the credit of acting impartially.</P>

<PB N="16" REF="034600_0013_0FFF13BEA13F5E28"/>
<HEAD>SECTION V. THE ARRANGEMENT OF AN EXHIBITION.</HEAD>
<P>BEING stored with single pieces, dialogues, dramas, and all legitimate materials of an exhibition—nothing pro∣fane or indecent being admitted—having also digested righteous principles of assigning parts in your mind and compleated that difficult work; it now remains, to arrange those parts so, as to constitute an agreeable whole—the first thing is to determine how many single pieces you will have. You may think it an arbitrary matter, but it is not—there ought to be two, three, or five—one single piece makes the exhibition appear odd▪ It must then have a head without feet, or feet without a head—two sin∣gle pieces convey an idea of a beginning and end, in regu∣lar method—but such an exhibition, tho it may not offend, because it is regular, will not please in the highest degree, because it does not excite an idea of variety which is suffi∣ciently clear—five single pieces, unless you mean to have a very long exhibition, will be out of all proportion with the other parts—and four exactly divides the exhibition into halves, and annihilates the pleasing idea of variety in the general arrangement.</P>
<P>Three single pieces seem then to be the number most convenient, and we shall call them the prologue, the inter∣mediate, and the epilogue.—Very much of the eclat of an exhibition depends on these—we shall therefore describe them in their order with the parts which should come be∣tween them.</P>
<P N="1">1. The PROLOGUE or introductory piece should al∣ways be assumed from some topic which is calculated to waken the tender feelings of the audience, and dispose them to candor—the tender sensibility of youth, their de∣sire to please, their expectations of kindness from their par∣ents and friends, are suitable ideas for a <HI>prologue.</HI> And these may be mixed with any other which may prepare the au∣dience to receive the exhibition kindly—It should be spok∣en generally in a rather low pitch of the voice and with the air of diffidence, expressive of the modesty of the students and the respect which they feel for the audience.
<PB N="17" REF="034600_0014_0FFF13FB46884590"/>
Nothing is more absurd than blustering, and towering rhetoric in a prologue.</P>
<P>If there be any serious business of the school, such as ex∣amination of scholars in reading, philosophy, or any branch of science, it best comes in immediately after the prologue, and while the attention of the audience is not yet fatigued. But if every thing of this kind has been transacted before;-let the most serious and sublime pieces follow the prologue. While the attention is not yet fatigued the serious and the sublime strike the mind with much the greatest advantage. Matters which are weighty and apply to the judgment, are ill introduced after the mind is already overcharged. They cannot be received with the approbation they de∣serve, and consequently will be thought to be dull, and insipid.</P>
<P>It is a mistake to suppose an audience will not relish seri∣ous matter—Variety is pleasing to the human mind; and that exhibition will please most, which has some pieces se∣rious, some highly argumentative and rational, some pa∣thetic, some merely interesting, some highly diverting.— But most exhibitors err in forever aiming to excite a laugh. They are often unsuccessful, and then it occasions disgust. —And they are in danger of making the whole a scene of low buffoonery.</P>
<P>When the dialogists have transacted all matters of the most serious and solid kind, it will be best to vary the ex∣ercises, and bring in the</P>
<P N="2">2. INTERMEDIATE—a single piece, taken from any top∣ic which is amusing. It should be a piece which requires no great attention of the mind to understand it; and it ought not by any means to be pathetic or sublime; but some pretty speech, which shall relieve the attention, and give the mind opportunity to recruit itself for the Dramas which are to follow. The fable of the Two Ladies, the Florist and the Bear, is a good example. The character∣istic of this part is that it entertains the mind without fa∣tiguing it, and leaves all the stronger passions unengaged for the pathetic scenes which are to follow. Next after the intermediate should come in the most interesting and pas∣sionate pieces which you have to exhibit. These will take less, if exhibited after the audience have been raised to a high pitch of mirth. Then to conclude the dialogistic rep∣resentation,
<PB N="18" REF="034600_0015_0FFF13C12E4A3070"/>
introduce a piece which is highly diverting▪ and thus the mind will find itself agreeably relieved from the intensity of the passions, and you will then, to conclude your exhibition, only want a good▪</P>
<P N="3">3. EPILOGUE or concluding part. This part will con∣tain many interesting matters; compliments to the audi∣ence, for their candor and attention; thanks to the parents and guardians for affording the means of instruction; ad∣dresses to amicable and parental affections; school mates taking leave of each other, &amp;c.—And indeed polite and genteel address and compliments to several parts of the as∣sembly, will make the varied substance of this part. A well written Epilogue, in which all the ornament and pomp of verse may be shown, all the graces of the most refined elocution should be displayed, pronounced in a mixt school by some elegant young lady, will give such a finishing stroke to the whole, as to leave the audience little power or will to criticise upon the performances. And they must go away pronouncing it a good exhibition. If they find their feelings are not shocked, or their reason affronted, but with the entertainment they have received good prin∣ciples, which remain fixed in their memories, they will not long be enemies to exhibitions.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION VI. OF THE LENGTH AND QUANTITY OF AN EX∣HIBITION.</HEAD>
<P>THE time of an exhibition ought not to exceed four hours and half, or at the most five hours. Lengthy enter∣tainments, where the audience are so confined, will necess∣arily grow tiresome: and the best pieces, after the hear∣ers are tired, make no favorable impression. Four or six dramatic pieces are enough. Let two of four and three of six dramatic pieces precede the intermediate, and the same numbers follow it: thus you will have either seven or nine pieces in the whole; and the odd numbers are best, because they remove the idea of uniformity, which is tire∣some when carried to an excess.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION VII. REMARKS ON ATTITUDES, GESTURES &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE first thing necessary for a person performing well is, that which is necessary to all polite behavior in gen∣teel companies. It is to enter an audience or company in an easy and graceful manner, and leave it in the same stile. The gentleman or lady who is to perform, must be able to enter without trembling and extreme agitation—with a steady countenance, suited to the part to be performed— and must do the honors of entrance, in a bow or courtesy, in an easy and elegant manner, whenever that is required. —And even in burlesque or passionate parts, the entrance or exit must be suited to and entirely governed by the part to which it belongs.</P>
<P>To bring your scholars to act thus easily and genteely, attend first to the neatness of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir persons. See that they be cleanly, and neat in their dress, that they be well washed and combed every day. This done will give them genteel feelings, which will express themselves in genteel airs. Allow no scholar to affect oddity or to dress in an absurd, and uncouth manner. Use them to decent and handsome positions in reading—correct them if they hang their heads down on their bosoms or on one side, if they stoop forward or strut back immoderately. Suffer them not to lounge and loll about, to distort their faces, or limbs, to roll their eyes about, or make any awkward or disagreeable motion, with them.</P>
<P>Instruct them how to come into a room and how to go out—Let a young gentleman always stand firmly on his feet to make a bow, and learn to bring up his feet to a firm position—without appearing to design it—When a man beings up his right foot so that the heel of it shall be two or three inches distant from the buckle or shoetye of the left, he stands in a good position to make a bow—He should take off his hat, raising his hand to his head in a spiral line —not catching it off, in a direct line, either sideways, or before. He should bend his body not in one point only, but its flexture should begin from the neck and proceed from thence gradually downward—And a bow to express rev∣erence,
<PB N="20" REF="034600_0017_0FFF13C56410A698"/>
should at least be so low, that the eyes in their nat∣ural position in the head, should be directed to the feet of the person to whom the bow is made. However it must be varied according to the greater or less degree of respect to be expressed by it—There should be no toss of the head, no hitch, or jerk in making a bow. But the motion of it, should always be smooth and easy both in falling and raising of the body—The hat should be put on with the hand mo∣ving in a spiral line, as in taking it off—and in taking off the hat, and putting it on, you should never bring your hat between your face, and the face of the person to whom your speech is directed—The arms should, in entering a room, hang easy by the sides, neither extended in any direction nor hanging exactly parallel to the sides of the body.</P>
<P>A young Lady should in general enter a room with a steady modest countenance. She should bring up her feet to a firm position to make a courtesy. Perhaps as good a one for general use as any is to have the heel of the left foot at a moderate distance from the shoetye of the right, and govern her motions with her right foot; or if a lady does not find this easy, let her take the reverse, or any position in which she can stand firm to command her motions, and her figure not be ungraceful—It is very graceful to bring her clothes forward by a small almost imperceptible motion, so as to hide the flexure of her limbs, before she lets herself down— Then she should appear to sink with an easy motion, as low as intended, and if she can add a very small motion, as if withdrawing thro modesty from the object to which she addresses herself, it will make her appear very graceful. She should with an easy motion, rise to her natural mode of standing—Here let it be observed that her arms should not be folded on her lap; but hang in an easy manner, at the sides. And the withdrawing motion, should be very small, in all instances. And by persons who naturally stoop forward it had better be wholly omitted. Nay it had bet∣ter be omitted by all who cannot perform it gracefully.</P>
<P>If your scholars have had the advantage of a good dancing school, it will save you much attention to these matters—but if they have had no instruction of this kind, it must be given, or you never will have a good exhibition.</P>
<P>The main difficulty is to get a scholar into the habit of entering into and going out of a room with perfect com∣posure and ease of mind. For this end it will be useful to
<PB N="21" REF="034600_0018_0FFF1401130DA3C8"/>
let your scholars, taking their turns, go out of the school room, speaking something to the student, as "ladies, or gentlemen," (as the case may be) "we wish you a happy day" or in entering— saying "gentlemen or ladies I am very happy to see you" or any other civil sentence or phrase— this should be done while they are conscious of being observed by the school. And when they are able to do this composedly, you will soon find them able to per∣form any thing with composure, which you can wish them to perform.</P>
<P>For the movements of the hands, &amp;c. &amp;c. and how the passions are expressed— you may look into any of the com∣mon books on this subject. The "Art of Speaking" says as much on that head▪ as is useful, and even more. As to the expression of the passions in the countenance, the <HI>Plate of the passions</HI> in the English "Preceptor;" or in <HI>Hogarth's "Analysis of Beauty,</HI>" will teach more than all the written precepts in the world.</P>
<P>But the rhetoric of young ladies should be suitable to their sex. It should never be violent. A lady should never extend her arms at full length, or strike her bosom with her hands, or raise her hand aloft, above her head — a lady in any violent passion should not give it full vent; but appear to be endeavoring to suppress it.—And never even till death should lose her care for decency—And a lady should never address an assembly at large; but may speak to her parents, her guardian, her school mates, &amp;c. And of all things a lady should never address herself to the young men. It should always be considered that a young lady in a school is not actress but merely a scholar. Her object is learning. She should behave exactly as we might rationally suppose a genteel lady would behave in such a situation—except only in burlesque parts, and in them no lady should trespass upon decency.</P>
<P>All the performers in dialogues should appear to ad∣dress each other, and to take no kind of notice of the audi∣ence, unless the parts they are performing requires it —The performers should move about on the stage as the action of the piece requires —neither should they stand toe to toe like boxers, nor should they move but with reason, and to heighten the effect of the piece.</P>
<P>As much of gesture as can be applied with reason; as much motion on the stage, as is proper and natural, should
<PB N="22" REF="034600_0019_0FFF13C849AA9FE8"/>
be used. It makes the pieces lively, and is very interesting to the audience—But more should not by any means be admitted.</P>
<P>It is foreign to the purpose of a school to overload exhi∣bitions with music and adventitious ornaments; they cover the faults of a bad exhibition but spoil a good one by drawing off the attention of the audience from the speaking and manners of the students to other objects—the elocu∣tion and polite behavior of the students are the grand points to be regarded —yet a few musical pieces may be admmitted if properly applied.</P>
<P>In their behavior the young ladies should be guarded from mincing fidgetry and all silly coquettish airs; should use no affected graces, nor should they be allowed to use any familiarity with the young men, which might offend the nicest taste.</P>
<P>The young gentlemen should behave properly to the ladies, treat them respectfully and offer them no rude or even familiar behavior, so as in the least to offend persons of delicacy—A young gentleman acting a rational part should always address a lady standing at her left hand, and bearing his weight on the foot next to her, to give himself the air of tenderness and respect—A young gentleman may kiss the hand of a lady in token of respect; or he may support her with her arm. But proper amorous kissing, embracing, are things which nature never meant to be ex∣hibited in public.</P>
<P>And tho the practice of modern theatres may be otherwise, it is a rule given by Horace in his "Art of Poetry," that no savage murders or peculiarly shocking barbarities be rep∣resented on the stage—Every thing of that kind if supposed at all should be imagined to be done at a distance.</P>
<P>The dresses should be suited to the character, but they need not be expensive. A simple wreath of laurel may de∣note a conqueror, a diadem a monarch; his badge of of∣fice any magistrate. We know so little of the dress of an∣tient and foreign nations, that any very simple device answers to convey the idea of office.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION VIII. OF REHEARSALS; AND HOW TO KNOW WHEN THE STUDENTS ARE FIT FOR EX∣HIBITION.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY thing which is absurd in action or speech strikes any person instantaneously who has but a little knowledge of what is right; let your scholars in a great measure cor∣rect one another. As to entrances and exits, practise your scholars to go in turns and make their exit and entrance under the observance of the school, till, on the perform∣ance, the looks of the school testify approbation—For if there be the least awkwardness, those who are observers will perceive it, and it will affect them very strongly—Tho they mean to be extremely kind to one another, they will not be able to suppress a laugh. But when all are come to the point that they perform passably, they will mutu∣ally show their approbation in their countenance—The like may be said of gesture. When one part of the school are spectators and the other part performers, those gestures which affect the spectators agreeably, are with very few exceptions good. Those which affect them disagreea∣bly, bad—The principles of these affections are properly natural.</P>
<P>IT is generally best, if your school be large, to divide it, and not always have the whole school together at rehear∣sals. And especially, if you, to save the time of your scholars and prevent the study of rhetoric from intruding on other studies, have your rehearsals in the evening; it will be best to divide the school, that the scholars may not be kept out too late in the evening and incur censure on that account.</P>
<P>In your rehearsals, correct all false pronunciation first. Make them recite and pronounce the pieces well. Then add gradually the graces of motion, and corporal gesture. And when you find that while one party of your scholars is performing, the rest who make a little audience are prop∣erly affected—you have obtained your aim. If the gen∣teel scenes produce strong expressions of approbation—if the ridiculous parts readily and promptly excite laughter— if the pathetic ones bring tears into the eyes of the audit∣ors;
<PB N="24" REF="034600_0021_0FFF13CAB1A80558"/>
then your pieces are ripe for exhibition. And to de∣lay it longer would be to let the ardor of your scholars abate; and, consequently, to lose in some measure, the life of your exhibition.</P>
<P>It is a great point both at rehearsals, and exhibitions, to keep up the courage of your scholars. Always correct them, unless they show obstinacy, in a mild tone of voice. Assure them that they will soon overcome all difficulties, and do very well—you must possess their confidence else you cannot inspire them with courage—frequently talk with them about speaking, and gesture, and show that you mean never to hurt their feelings if you can possibly avoid it. Yet correct every instance punctually in which your scholars fail; and assure them, that it is necessary to give them a good appearance, and make them eminent speakers, and in prompting both at rehearsals and exhibitions, al∣ways speak very distinctly, but in a soft and encouraging tone of voice, that your scholars may not lose the com∣mand of feeling, by apprehension of your displeasure.</P>
<P>If any of your scholars make an absolute <HI>sauxpas</HI> and get entirely out; by a <HI>preconcerted sign,</HI> let them retire, say∣ing nothing about it —say not a word to them of disap∣probation; but encourage them, and bring them on again in another place—by this device you may in many instan∣ces conceal the fault from the audience, or you may pre∣vent its being very sensibly felt.</P>
<P>Yet the scholars should understand that they have the utmost displeasure of their preceptor to fear, if they wilfully do any thing that is improper at an exhibition. For un∣less he be able to command the prompt obedience of his scholars, it will be absolutely unjust that he should be an∣swerable for the event.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION IX. OF THE BENEFIT OF SCHOOL EXHIBITIONS.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN school exhibitions are regulated by reason, di∣vested of extreme expense, and conducted with propriety they are of very great use— they awaken the ambition of students, and they become desirous of behaving in a ration∣al manner. We suppose in saying this, that the parts they
<PB N="25" REF="034600_0022_0FFF140491BBB028"/>
have performed be such as reason and religion do not disapprove. That they are replete with good sentiments, and promotive of good morals. It has often been observed, that where there have been in the same town, schools on the same footing in other respects, yet some have had exhibitions and others not, that the schools in which there have been exhibitions, have not only excelled in the point of exhibit∣ions but in every other. The rudest nymphs or swains by practising on rhetoric will soon acquire polite manners, for they will often personate the most polite characters. And tho the surly majesty of some male despots among us, may envy the graces of rhetoric to women, because they find themselves already outdone by women in every other ex∣cellence; yet it is certain, that a clear, genteel manner of expressing themselves, is a vast advantage to women, in forming that important alliance, which is to last for life.—And in the marriage state the mother who has been taught to read and speak with propriety▪ will be of unspeak∣able advantage to her children in forming their elocution in early life. And we know that bad habits formed in childhood, stick to many gentlemen of the court the pulpit, and the bar▪ all their lives. Let school exhibitions consist of laudable materials, and be managed with prudence, they will be of great advantage to both sexes, and form for all hearers an useful and instructive entertainment.</P>

<PB REF="034600_0024_0FFF140D5D0978C0"/>
<HEAD>Preface to the Dialogues.</HEAD>
<P>IN the following dialogues the author has aimed to ex∣emplify the principal virtues and vices of human beings, some times a moral principle, is best represented affir∣matively; the principle stated and the example given. An instance of this kind you have in <HI>Lucy,</HI> the principal charac∣ter in the first Dialogue—Here the principle is set forth, directly in an example of virtue—Sometimes the necessity of a virtue is shown, by the embarrassments attending the opposite vice—As in the character of Fieldfare in the Foundling, or of Amesa in Scanderbeg—This resembles the <HI>Reductio ad abs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rdum</HI> so familiarly known in Logic and Mathematics—The Author thinks that neither of these procedures can be objected to on just principles, for we may practice virtue directly on its own principles, or may set ourselves right by avoiding that which is wrong.</P>
<P>It may possibly be objected, that some of the characters are too high charged and exceed any thing found in real life—The character of <HI>Nelly</HI> in the "Mother of a Family," and of <HI>Butterford</HI> in "The Maid of the groves," and of <HI>Puffpaste</HI> in the 'Founding,' if any, will be tho't of this kind — But the author had his reasons for this seeming excess. In the character of <HI>Nelly</HI> he would represent the prodigious disadvantage, under which even a woman of a good mind may appear, totally destitute of proper education—In that of Butterford he would show how extremely disagreeable a man of fortune is, void of virtue and good breeding—In the character of Puffpaste he would show that an honest well meaning man, will, notwithstanding the utmost disad∣vantages, with respect to external appearances, have some∣thing entertaining and agreeable about him, and will in fact appear superior to a man of the greatest refinement of education who yet neglects virtue—These characters are so exaggerated that young persons, who are always want∣ing in experience, may the better discern the intention of them.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="034600_0025_0FFF13CC96442260"/>It may be said that some of the pieces cannot pretend to originality—That there is a resemblance between "The Triumph of Temper" and Shakespear's "Taming of the Shrew;" between the "Father of a Family—and the "Pere de Famille" of Diederot. That the "Little Box" is partly taken from the "Cistellaria" and partly from the "Poenus" of Plautus—That the "Captive" savours strongly of the "Capteivi of the last mentioned author. That the "Or∣phan of China" has been better dramatized by Voltaire and Dr. Murphy. That the "Discontented" wife, is but the enlargement of the "UxorMempsigamos" of Erasmus. The author will deny nothing of this; but say that he has given those pieces a cast better fitted for schools than their originals, and they are so far new that he believes that there is not a correspondent page between his book and any other book now in print.</P>
<P>Should the critics of the age make any remarks upon this; or any of the author's works, he means to profit by it—He will be ready if his work should outlive the present edition to alter any sentiments, word, or phrase, that proves to be wrong, as his aim is to gain esteem, if he gains it at all, by fair means—and he would do as much good as he is able in the short space of life allotted to man—Wishing, he confesses, for some degree of approbation for wellmean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> endeavors, he resigns himself to the candid and impartial public.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL what do you think of our Lucy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is very singular, she acts precisely, and by rule, yet with ease—It is the native goodness of her heart which guides her, she wishes to do right, and that guides her to do it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is surprising to see how she is liked by the young gentlemen. The most artful women, who sometimes please the men, and sometimes plague them, are nothing to her for gaining their esteem.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suspect one reason why many women are not pleasing to men is because all their conduct favors of arti∣fice, and indicates want of good principles—I do not think that men in general are very fond of coquetry in women.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then women are generally mistaken. And their education is often conducted wrong. Many are brought up to act the coquette from their cradles. Miss Lizard says that to hold a lover long, you must hold him <HI>uneasy.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Either her system is not good, or she does not use it, for she has had six new suitors in six months, and the last is said to have left her much against her will. But my cousin Fidelia says the best way to keep a lover is to make him <HI>contented</HI> with his choice, and to <HI>improve</HI> one's self <HI>con∣tinually,</HI> so that the last interview shall always be the most agreeable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Much Fidelia knows about it, she never had but one suitor in her life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not think that against her; for she has always kept him; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e as the needle to the pole-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar.

<P>Then they will be disgusted with each other soon —They cannot always live upon sweetmeats, I am sure.</P>

<P>Longer than you imagine. They intend to try it for life. He has purchased a house, and her household furniture is all ready.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well this is a pretty affair indeed that such girls as Fidelia and Lucy, who can boast of nothing but beauty, good sense, education, and virtue, should gain the confidence of the finest gentlemen; and be married just when they please. When we that are rich, &amp; can dress fine, and under∣stand exactly all the arts of gaining the affections, must sit by. And if we can be bridemaids, it is a great honor.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Soph.</SPEAKER>
<P>We must bear it, for the present, with patience; and establish some principles which will cause our acquain∣tance to place confidence in us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>As much as I hate reading, I would study For∣dyce, Addison, and all the moral writers, a twelve month, to get such a name as Lucy has. A gentleman said this morning—"That he should depend on her promise, as much as on the rising of the sun—and were he to love her, and be denied; he would go strait to the river, and take his plunge at once—and once for all, for he should not expect to move her, by art, or persuasion, any more than to move the earth from its centre."</P>

<P>Why?</P>

<P>I do not love to be trusted with so much wick∣edness. He has engaged the hearts of a number of wom∣en, and then left them to miserable disappointment.</P>

<P>Then you ought to expose him publicly.</P>

<P>Have you promised him secrecy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>No, I never did, nor laid myself under any obli∣gation to him; but I shall not like to have the name of betraying conversation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tukely.</SPEAKER>
<P>I find he has marked out my sister for his game. I shall prevent him there. For I will kill him, right or wrong, before he shall win my sister, and bring infamy on our family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was never ambitious of conquest among the la∣dies. Loss of reputation is worse than death to them; and occasions great misery among their near relations, howev∣er innocent. I cannot build my happiness on the misery of others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tukely.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I think a man of your blunt honesty ought to expose the Captain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall not speak of his gallantries which have been confided to me; at least not publickly. There is a tacit reliance on one's secrecy in matters which affect reputation, whether we have promised secrecy or not.</P>

<P>Capt. Flash takes his stand commonly near the ever green hedge by Rosamond's pond. It is a spot very convenient to talk wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> people aside.</P>

<P>Every human being has some vices.

How shall we cure, or alleviate those vices in our near relations—by mildness or severity?—is not mildness most likely to gain the heart, and consequently to give us the greatest influence?</P>

<P>Why, had I not a right to curse her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Pau.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps not—You had a right to think she was a silly girl. For it is a great folly in young people to reject that counsel of elder persons which is the effect of experience, and count it as nothing. But your daughter was free, and what avails liberty if we cannot use it in that concern which is dearest to the human heart? So you may say she was silly; and had a right to think so, and place the less confidence in her on that account. But how she could be so guilty as to deserve an irrevocable curse I cannot comprehend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. Leer.</SPEAKER>
<P>But she ought to have heard to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Pau.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is very true, and she was a silly girl that she did not. But perhaps not guilty of any real crime. There are in the human constitution remarkable and un∣conquerable attachments and aversions—The convictions of the mind will not always bear sway, much less take advice from others—What would you do if any person should put a cat under your table or under your pillow—What would you say?</P>

<P>O my dear, my wife—I will not be unkind; but I am distracted; I am certainly undone, I have lost all the money I had raised from your box of jewels—O that I could die with innocence; then I should be glad to die.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Kep.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, die, because you have lost your money: fie my husband, fie upon it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Kep.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have now lost every thing, and have com∣pletely ruined you, as well as myself; we are as poor as the poorest beggars—My dear, were it not that I would live as a mere servant to you, I could wish to die.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Kep.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you not recollect that when my mother opposed our marriage you told me, in one of your ardent raptures, nay you solemnly declared, that you could be happy even in the meanest cottage, and to live by the hardest labor, if you could only live with me—I laid that up in my heart.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Kep.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was not the effect of rapture. It was my serious sentiment, and I think so now.</P>

<P>Then we have lost nothing; only leave gam∣ing, and we shall be happy.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Keen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why should I not think you happy? I wonder you do not die outright with vexation—You work extreme∣ly hard, and have to pay the severest attention from night to day, and from day to night—Your children are the most disorderly crew that ever were hatched, when they are out of humor they are always a bawling—There will be half a dozen of them tuning up at once—They are ever fighting and clawing one another—When they are in good humor they play with execessive noise and violence as if the house were going out at the windows—Then they are upsetting every thing thro the whole house—They are ever breaking their own shins or one anothers noses—They are ever losing their hats and their shoes—One falls down stairs and is tak∣en up half dead—One is burnt and another is scalded— Another cuts his leg, or his hand, and is bleeding to death. Then you are all in tears—and—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>And can you think of nothing farther? You have not told me half of the truth yet. I have seen and suffe∣red ten times as much as you have any idea of; and yet I am not unhappy—I have a very kind husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Keen.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, yes, I suppose that kind husband makes up for all—He pretends to be fond of you, and flatters you—He is cunning enough for himself. You place entire confi∣dence in him. Were he to tell you that a bedlam was a palace, you would believe him. After your children had worried you all day, on seeing your husband come home at night I have seen you shed tears of joy—and you had to wait on him two hours. I really felt ashamed for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Good.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a simplicity you are sister, with all your boasted sense.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Simplicity I will be then—your husband by being so obstinate has brought a lawsuit upon himself, which ma∣ny people say will ruin him. I expect in a few days to see you turned out of house and home.

<P>I wish you would try, for she is so awkward now that I am quite ashamed of her and she is ashamed of her∣self.

Now girls let me give you one piece of advice. Above all do you avoid being mar∣ried. It is the worst of all evils. You see what a deplora∣ble situation your mother is in. Her eldest son is going to be expelled from the college—There is one child dy∣ing of the apoplexy. Another has broke his arm, one girl so awkward and so vicious that she plagues her heart out. Her husband absent, and must lose his estate before he comes back. Now young ladies fix the matter in your own minds that you never will be married. Then let the men coax and teaze, and plead, and flatter, and caress you ever so much, be steady, let them know you won't, and that's enough.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mith.</SPEAKER>
<P>The first point it to avoid indolence and luxury —Chuse to labor for others rather than that they should labor for you. And excell all others in those things in which they most excell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cyr.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never could bear to be outdone in any thing. I can live without sleep. I watched three whole days and nights with my grandfather, when he was sick in Media. I can endure the want of food—I have hunted often from break of day till evening and ate nothing but a piece of dry bread, and a bunch of cresses pulled out of a brook.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mith.</SPEAKER>
<P>These are true signs of future greatness. But chastity in love affairs is very necessary—If you would be happy you must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave but one wife.</P>

</SP>

<SPEAKER>Mith.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not good for themselves. Love is most hap∣py, when directed to a single object—as a river flowing compact is noble, and dispenses a thousand blessings; di∣vided, it sinks in mean rivulets, and dirty puddles—divid∣ed love has ruined most of the princes of the east.</P>

<SPEAKER>Field.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, but a wretched dependent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, such is exactly the freedom which a man en∣joys who refuses marriage, except that it is neither so in∣nocent, nor so reputable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Field.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you think the acquisition of valuable prop∣erty makes no man the less free.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Much less does the acquisition of valuable friends. All that liberty is worth is that we may gain such possessions, and serve them; but the evil of want of principle, is great. It hurts many persons who ought to be happy.</P>

<P>No, I do not for a woman to leave the company of her husband, and the care of her children; to go to some public house, and pass the evening at cards—where, if suc∣cessful she stays late—if unfortunate she comes home peev∣ish—and the worst company imaginable to her family.</P>

<P>You have given a ridiculous turn to the sentiment. But let me express it and see if it can be despised. It is dangerous for a woman to be a gamester. She will lose her character, her husband's affections, and the respect of her children, and then she cannot be happy.</P>

<P>True, I know no difference but on the best side.— Mr. Allworthy has ever been more kind and more attentive to me since we were married than before. The truth is, he always was a proper gentleman.</P>

<P>To be serious then, all I know of it is this, that I first considered whether Mr. Allworthy were a reasonable man.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>All.</SPEAKER>
<P>Human life has thorns enough without making any artificial ones—And is it not a fact, that both men and wo∣men are most attached where they feel most happy? They are most easy in their minds where they are best treated, and enjoy the pleasure of self esteem. I consider vice and folly as out of the question.</P>

</SP>

<P>It is as delicate as to torment him.

In that consists the whole secret —and tho you do it by design, a man who loves you, will always think you do it from the native goodness of your heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eight.</SPEAKER>
<P>If that be the way I shall let him pass, I am determined they shall love me for my beauty and my fine accomplishments: and if ever I be married I will do as I please, that is positive.</P>

<P><STAGE>[Making a very awkward bow]</STAGE>
GOOD evening, Madam, How do ye do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Iron.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well I'm glad to see you—Why I hardly know how I do do—but I'm fain to do whatever I have to do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where's Jule, is she to home?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Iron.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes she is stept out, and will be in, in a min∣ute—I don't know what makes her stay. Juley!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Coming soon ma'am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Well how does Jule do now—I'm going to make her my offers. Do you think she'll bite sharp. No man can give a better astayte than I. —</P>

<P>Coming ma'am very soon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Iron.</SPEAKER>
<P>She's not quite dressed I suppose. These girls have a despot notion of rigging up—when they are to meet a spark: that's quite natural d'ye see — I told Juley you'd got a new suit—It seemed to make her quite merry. —Juley!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Coming soon ma'am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then she was merry to think I had got these clothes —I hope that is a good sign. If I could make Jule have me I should be <HI>possed</HI> glad—Then I'd sit in my great chair and tell her to bring this and carry that—Then I'd laugh in my sleeve to see how obedient she'd be—and when she waited on me like a little spaniel — and I'd speak sharp and make her tremble and fly—and a man would come in and say what a sweet pretty wise you have, Mr. Butterford— Then I give him a tuck in the ribs—Hah! old fellow, why you fool, way could'nt you get such a wise hoh! hoh! hoh!</P>

lady whose character was suspected, walked barefoot among red hot ploughshares, with scarcely room to set her feet to the ground; and if she burned her feet in the least, it was concluded that she was guilty. Such is the life of a Minister of a parish. Manly is a person whom I truly like, tho his estate is but moderate. Butterford is a proper clown, and a vicious fellow. The families both treat me well. The blacksmith and his wife are singular, but they are kind to me—They wish me to advise Juliet, my amia∣ble pupil, to marry Butterford. Can I in justice do it? Certainly not. This is an ugly affair—Let me think— won't this do? Mother Ironside loves to talk morals and have all the talk to herself—Suppose I let her go her own length, till she his confuted herself—Will any call that priestcraft?

<P>MY amiable pupil almost as dear to me as a daughter —I have received a letter, from your father that he shall not soon return. He has received a letter which states that you died the 12th of July last—On which he orders me to sell his estate, and he is about to embark for the East-Indies.</P>

This last stroke is Butterford's work. I am confi∣dent, he hires a base fellow to write for him. He forged a letter yesterday to Mr. Daffodil, to slander Miss May∣flower and signed it with my name to involve me in a quarrel with Miss Mayflower and her family.

A woman deserted by a man once engaged to her, is subject to many censures, and dangerous suspicions.

So a lover suitable to my taste, must broil with resentment, must be roasted with anger, must be baked by the heat of constant affection, must boil with jealousy, must be smoked with contempt—and his very marrow must be dried up with anxious expectation. If I afford him any attention he must be elated to the highest degree of joy.

He caught a severe cold, and was confined a fortnight—An∣other time she pretended that she took a new beaver hat from him, and burnt it—but she kept it and changed it for an umbrella. She frequently makes him do the meanest errands for her—send him all over town, to buy a penny-worth of needles, half a knot of thread, and half a yard of tape.

I have treasured many of these maxims in my mind —to me if it ever fall to my lot, I intend it shall be the school of wisdom—and prepare my mind for the various duties of domestic life.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>There you differ from me — The sentiments of people who are not of our own age may be of great use to us. They can give us credit and a good name—But I doubt whether it is right to seek the particular admiration of many persons of our own age at once.</P>

when one can get nothing else. It is more pleasing to hear good sense, or what we call good sense; but I had rather men would flatter me than say nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>The whole business is commonly artificial. A man uses flattery as musicians do the fa, sol, la, me, of their gamut, to put their voices into tune.

<P>These ladies are a curious-contrast: their reading is as singular as their conduct.

<P>Let us not have any words, my dear, on that matter—you was as fond of her learning music as I, but we were both much to blame.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Why I have always told her she must not pretend to like any of the young fellows without my leave; and I have never given her any leave about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Girls do not always wait for their mothers leave in those matters. But we were more to blame than she, to hire him into the house and let him have access to her at all hours.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Tart.</SPEAKER>
<P>But girls need not throw themselves away neither, if their parents do give them liberties.</P>
</SP>

<P>It is possible they may be affected with kind, and tender attentions as well as men. I have no disposition to quarrel with her.</P>

<P>I'd quarrel with him then, and I say again, if I could not make him leave her otherwise, I'd break his back.</P>
</SP>

<P>It is my serious opinion that the parents who take a gay young man into the family as an instructor to their daughters, are more to blame than their daughters, if con∣sequences should not be agreeable—But I shall use my best endeavor, to remove the evil, and in the easiest man∣ner possible.</P>

<P>It has often given me the most serious concern— for I perceive that I cannot resign him without pain—yet I have had many serious hours of reflection, if he does not apply himself to any steady business how we shall be able to live in any credit, or reputation—and indeed, how we shall be able to live at all—for my fortune is not so great as to last forever, without any further income.</P>

<P>NOW from my soul I wish he had less reason, then I could suppose he had more love—He is as cool in his courtship as if he were casting up a column of figures— He is a worthy man, but after all not at all to my taste.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fore.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Madam you really appear melancholy.</P>

<P>I am so—I find I have left my morning's work to do in the afternoon, I am vexed with myself.</P>

<P>I do not comprehend your meaning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Haw.</SPEAKER>
<P>The truth is, when I was young, from twenty to thirty, I had a number of very good offers for marriage, but full of the love of liberty &amp; dissipation, I declined them,

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fore.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is an exact gentleman, to be sure.</P>

<P>Exact! All system, method and order; I do not love to be measured by the square and compass.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Fore.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is a very virtuous man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Haw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I esteem him, and yet after all I don't like him—He makes love by calculation,—besides he is eight years older than I.</P>
</SP>

<P>He must be old then, with an emphasis.</P>

<P>I suppose not—But he is very much engaged with Miss Emily Howard.</P>

<SPEAKER>Haw.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is an easy remedy for that; I could fright her out of that fancy in five minutes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fore.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not so certain of that—Those modest girls, when they once get engaged, are commonly engaged to purpose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Haw.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can easily fright her out of the project. She is afraid of her own shadow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fore.</SPEAKER>
<P>She may be afraid of a shadow, and have no ob∣jection to the substance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Haw.</SPEAKER>
<P>O I can manage the matter with her. There is Mrs. Easy,—She had a most wretched husband, and if she were to talk with Emily about the men, she would half fright her to death in ten minutes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fore.</SPEAKER>
<P>Much I doubt that. But I have no objection to your trying the experiment.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE QUARRELS OF MARRIED PERSONS ARE GENERALLY FRIVOLOUS.</HEAD>
<P>IT is generally very idle for people in the vicinity, to interpose in the quarrels of married persons. Marriage obliges, and almost necessitates, a man and his wife, to be of a mind, in things of great consequence—Their quarrels arise from some tri∣fles: a mere momentary humor, or accidental word, and counter passions, have more influence in re∣conciling them, than their reason. Hence this important moral arises; that married persons never make complaints of each other abroad, and that their neighbors interpose in none of their differences—lest work be made for repentance.</P>

<P>You would not wish for such humiliation in your husband, would you degrade the man whom you are to love? more than this, if he can find that you will see him; he will come to see you this very day—and if he can reconcile matters at home, he means to resign his commission; if not he means to march in three days.</P>

<P>IT is very pernicious to families, when parents form designs which produce mistrust among their children —or children pursue schemes of their own, without the intelligence of their parents.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">DISPLAYING THE WEAKNESS OF THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN FORTUNE-TELLERS.</HEAD>
<P>THE rage of curiosity, enquiring into future events, has been a vice of mankind in every age. There is more wickedness in this vice, than every one is aware of. It implies impatience, under the pres∣ent dispensations of Divine Providence, and dis∣trust for the future—It often excites delusive hopes— at other times, fills the mind with needless anguish and terror—And it greatly injures society, by sup∣porting a number of idle, unprincipled wretches, who make a fortune, in earnest, from the purses of the credulous.</P>

<P>HAVE you seen any thing of a roan mare who strayed away, or was stolen from my pasture yesterday?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralph.</SPEAKER>
<P>What were her marks?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Farm.</SPEAKER>
<P>She had three white feet, trotted very square; and had a blaze in her forehead.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralph.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not seen such a mare—but I believe my master can tell you of her—He understands such things well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Farm.</SPEAKER>
<P>They say he understands the art of conjuring; and can find los<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralph.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has got the true Elixir Planetarium a liquor which distills from the moon—and is squeezed out of the moss which grows on the tops of old "ruined castles and moss grown steeples." It resembles some of the finer wines —but the taste of it is very fine—And if any one tastes it, it makes him sensible of the influence of the stars, he can tell peoples fortune's—declare the place of lost goods—and indeed every thing one wants to know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Farm.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how came your master by this liquor?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralph.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has a bottle of it which was owned by Peter the Hermit, who preached up the Crusades for the recove∣ry of Jerusalem. It descended from him to Dr. Faustus— and from him to the famous Radcliffe of London—and it comes by inheritance to my master, who is the seventh son of a seventh son.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Farm.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's very strange I'll say for't. And can't he tell what has become of my mare?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralph.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am confident he can, for he can tell almost ev∣ery thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Farm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you know of particular cases in which he has told the truth?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, there was a girl in our neighborhood had a swee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heart, who was tho't to love her, very much. But
<PB N="303" REF="034600_0295_0FFF34A828A65388"/>
she said—Now my market is made—and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he grew sluttish, and careless and fancy. My master told her fortune, that she would grow careless and he would be sick of her and leave her—and that she would be miserable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Farm.</SPEAKER>
<P>How did the matter end?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralph</SPEAKER>
<P>Just as my master told in every particular. You would be surprized to find how exact he is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Farm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that is good guessing I count—But one in∣stance not enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralph.</SPEAKER>
<P>There was a young man, who courted a very in∣dustrious girl—He disliked her and left her, because she had a hard hand, and the ends of her fingers were rough by being pricked with a needle; and the mark of a thimble spoiled the beauty of one of her fingers—after he had left her he came to have his fortune told.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Farm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Immediately after leaving this girl?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralph.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, but he was then courting another, whose hands were as soft as paste—and there was not the least mark of a needle, thimble, or any blemish to be seen on her hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Farm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Could your master tell his fortune?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, he told him that he would marry an idle wife who would dissipate his fortune. And it turned out just so, in every particular.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Farm.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is reason in that—I guess your master is no common conjuror.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralph.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is an extraordinary man—One more instance I will tell, which must surprize you—For, I assure you, that bottle of my master's is brimful of wisdom—A young lady of our village trusted a gentleman his mere word for the security of her reputation—She came to my master to tell her fortune—He told her that the wretch would nev∣er marry her, and it turned out just so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Farm.</SPEAKER>
<P>How under the heavens could he know that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralph.</SPEAKER>
<P>He would know it above the heavens. Assoon as he tastes the Elixir Planetarium he becomes acquainted with the whole circuit of the stars—with all ther aspects and in∣fluence on the earth—and I have often heard him say that if a woman trust her reputation, to the mere word of a man —eight times out of twelve she will repent her confidence.</P>
</SP>

<P>It was all Rosina's contrivance, she loves frolicks, and is a perfect witch at intrigue to get young people to∣gether in the absence of the elder ones; that they may take the more liberty together.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>He will not like it. He says the amusements of young people should not exclude the observation of the elder—Because the observations of the elder persons in∣spire the young ones with a sense of decency—and the aged by sympathy enjoy over again the delights of youth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pom.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I suppose contributed to the happiness of both—I've heard him say that in Switzerland they dance after prayers in the evening, and the elder people wait on the young ones—I don't like this creeping into houses, in the absence of their owners—A shyness between the elder people, and the younger ones, denotes vulgarism in man∣ners and a low state of society.</P>

<P>Brushwood; a very remote part of the state.</P>

<P>You are the fellow I have been hearing of a num∣ber of days past—they told me there was a strange, wood∣enheaded fellow coming from Brushwood, a dark obscure hole, and that he had no more manners than a bear.</P>

<SP>

<P>Well what do you think of him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Think of you—Why as to your own proper self, you look passably well—But then how you dress, all as far from the fashion as from Nova Scotia to Georgia—What do you mean by wearing that old bayonet-hat—Your coat is half a yard too short—oh! fun indeed! this is pretty! what a coat!—and then your hair tied up with a leather— whang — You like old Jeremy—fact!—Why sir, what sort of people are they at Brushwood?</P>

he came from—they tell him he is a fellow they have heard of before—that he is a strange wondenheaded fellow, with no more manners than a bear—then they examine his per∣son, and tell him he looks passably, but his dress is out of fashion—his hat is not right, and his coat is half a yard too long or too short—they find fault with the tying of his hair, and ask what sort of people they were in the town from whence he came.</P>

<P>You lie. Those are not the manners of the peo∣ple at Brushwood.</P>

A charge of blasphemy is brought against me in the court of Areopagus —for teaching that there is but one God. I can demonstrate this truth But that avails nothing. The court are superstitious. I expect they will condemn me. But I will have one excercise more, before my death, to try the genius of some of my best scholars—and show the value of learning.

<P>YOUNG Gentlemen, I am happy in your presence. I have tho't of a question on which I desire you, as a trial of genius, to express severally your opinions.

<HEAD>MONEY.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phoc.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am, at present, pesuaded that it is money.— Whatever is the object of purchase, may be procured by money—Money has an amazing influence in deciding the opinions of men. Give a man a large sum on one side of a question; and nothing on the other—It is a wonder if he does not see all things right on that side where the mo∣ney lies. What <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and fatigues, will not a man undergo for the sake of money? Money procures trust and favor, preferment and elegance of life. Money wins the favor of the great; favor which cannot be purchased by merit. How easily will a rich man, by means of the favors which he confers on the poor, gain admittance to places of profit, and trust. The poor man's wisdom, (be he ever so wise,) is despised. But the man who has money has credit for every human faculty—He has wit, at least in estimation. His poorest observations are recommended, his flattest jests are laughed at, and applauded. The ladies love him, and their hearts own the sovereign power of gold. Lawyers for gold pervert law—Priests for gold have perverted re∣ligion—In fine, What will not money do? It is the God of this world—In my opinion money has the geeatest in∣fluence on the concerns of men.</P>

<HEAD>PLEASURE.</HEAD>

<P>I CAN by no means agree with the preceeding speaker—My opinion is that pleasure has the greatest in∣fluence over the concerns of men. For what purpose is money desirable, but that we may thereby procure plea∣sure—Money purchases houses, furniture, fields and gar∣dens; for what end, but that we may take our pleasure in
<PB N="403" REF="034600_0394_0FFF1166255CC9F0"/>
them. For what end do men ply themselves with strong liquors, but for the pleasures that are attendant on appe∣tite? Have you never known, how many votes are gained by certain persons, in our popular elections by distributing wines and sweet meats among the people? And what is the object of all learning: and of the curious arts but for the pleasure either of body, or mind, that they procure? The reputable matron, or honest householder, take pleasure in a beautiful and well ordered family, and in sincere, and delicious friendship, of which virtue alone is capable: from a mistaken idea of pleasure also, some youth of both sexes plunge themselves into the most infamous excesses, and by their miseries they discover how propense the human heart is to pleasure, that it will risk any thing for the prospect of it—In fine all happiness is pleasure in one sense or another; as the pursuit of all mankind is happiness, I determine that pleasure is that which has the greatest influence in all affairs of men.</P>

<P>MEN'S opinions are as various as their constitu∣tions. I must dissent from from both of my friends, who have spoken before me. My opinion is that, of all things, the civil power has the greatest influence over the con∣cerns of men—Who is equal to the chief ruler of any king∣dom, who can resist the supreme authority? It disposeth of persons and property, of the lives and virtues of citizens, which way soever the sovereign power shall turn itself; all must bend before it—In a state when the sovereignty is in the people, as it is in our commonwealth, the voice of the people carries every thing: you may as well put a stop to the swelling of the ocean, as resist the popular will—Hence it is said that the voice of the people is the voice of God, because it comes with irresistible power: in monarchies tho the sovreignty is supposed to have been tranferred from the people, to the monarch, and he on account of the dis∣potic power he possesses is feared, and honored as the vice-general of God—The supreme law is the safety of the state: this respects the whole, and not any particular mem∣ber of the commonwealth—Therefore I say, the civil pow∣er, has the greatest influence on the affairs of men.</P>

<PB N="404" REF="034600_0395_0FFF35A10E58DA00"/>
found—as to matters merely belonging to this world I af∣firm in opposition to the opinions already advanced—that women have more influence that money, pleasure, or the civil power—they compel us to love them, and we cannot help it. We love more than pleasure would dictate, we behold them with lively admiration, with the most intense respect, we consider our happiness as involved in theirs. Have you never heard of the Jewish tradition, that man, when first formed was placed in a garden beautiful as Elysian fields; yet would not be content without the society of a woman? Have you not also read in the tradition of an∣tient Greece—that Jupiter being offended with the man, and his wife, for stealing golden apples from the Hesperi∣an gardens, separated them from each other and placed his eagle between them, with a thunder bolt in his talons —The woman being afraid, fled and hid herself in the groves of Arcadia—the man watched the eagle for fifteen successive days and nights, till the eagle fell asleep, thro long watching, and dropped the thunderbolt from his tal∣ons—then flew the man to the groves and spoke to his wife in the language of love—Jupiter then declared that he would suffer their society, since there was no way to prevent it; but to strike them out of being.</P>
<P>Without saying any thing of the actual truth of these transactions, they prove that the connection of the sexes on the principles of virtue is natural and inviolable, and that this has ever been the tho't of men—whatever a man gains by study or labor, the spoils of war, and the profits of peace—the reward of genius, and ways of in∣dustry—are bro't by him, and freely bestowed on his wife. Happy, if by any means, he make her contented, and share the blessing of her smile — That women are slaves to gold, is a slander: we know them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, in contempt of riches, to give their hands and ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, to men of genius and merit—They are more powerful than princes, and kings; for our fathers have told us how at the court of Persia, the princess Apame being denied her request by the king— she took the crown from his head; gave him a slap on the cheek, and told him he should not have his crown again till he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> grant her request—the king laughing, turned the whole affair into a just, and granted her desire. But truth is powerful above all things. Money gotten by falshood shall never prosper in the
<PB N="405" REF="034600_0396_0FFF1167F1990580"/>
hands of its owner—the pleasure that is taken in false pur∣suits is unsatisfying to the mind, and lays the foundation of the most dreadful remorse. Power founded on fals∣hood and perfidy, tumbles violently into ruin—and even women if they forsake the ways of virtue, and act not agreeably to truth and reason—soon sink into contempt— truth prevents all wrong, and sits every thing right—truth therefore is greater and more influential than all things else, and the prudent man will always submit to truth.</P>

<P>Well now, young gentlemen my worthy pupils, this is my result on our question, Xenophon judged rightest. Of all things external to men's selves in this world women have the greatest influence over men's affairs. Men will give their money freely to their wives, they will sacrifice all other pleasures to the happiness of living with them. Without women there would be no commonwealth, consequently no civil power—but truth has more influence than women, in fine, women lose their influence at once, when they de∣part from virtue and truth, I have always loved truth and endeavored to serve God, and do good to men, to the utmost of my power. This is my consolation, now I hope I shall be accepted—I advise you always, my dear pupils, to do the same, you will find the comfort of it in life, and in death—To be stable in our sentiments and to possess true grandeur of soul, despising mean things and things un∣just, we must lay hold on the arms of him who sustains the pillars of the universe, or in plain words to believe all he orders for us to be the best. God is one, his power and

presence are every where—His faithfulness is steadier than the course of the sun—His truth is firmer than the rocks of Atlas—His power is more irrisistible than the winds or the waves, or the rapid force of thunder—His immensity exceeds the space of Heaven— His goodness milder than the rays of the morning. These are clear demonstrable tru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hs—as the moon derives her light from the sun.

<P>You will accuse me my friend Constantia!

but one God the Creator and Preserver of all whom the christians call by the endearing name of Father. They reveren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Jesus not as a man; but as the word and wis∣dom of God; and to promote the glory of the Father; for the word and wisdom of God dwelt in him.

<SP>

<P>Most certainly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Then I know most certainly that the wisdom of God dwelt in Jesus of Nazareth, because in opposition to the darkness of the world, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unk into vice and superstition, he taught us to adore one God▪ in whom we live, move, and have our being; to love him sincerely and obey him from the heart.

<P>According to their works do you say? I should not think that to be a very comfortable doctrine for you and me.</P>

<SP>

<P>Had you tho't of the matter at all you must have known; but to deal plainly with you, your head was always filled with court-intrigues. Your religion debases the idea of God, and degrades man. Jupiter, whom your poets stile father of Gods and men, is said to have many vices. According to your own writers he changed himself into a brute, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he might run away with Europa. At the same time he had, they say, a wife of his own.

Does not every man of honor and sobriety fly from a worshipper of Venus as from the plague? Is that religion, which ruins the morals of the people? Is not ill-nature itself adored in D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ana of Ephesus? Your own favorite, Homer, calls her the tygress of her sex.

<P>I never listened to discourses on this subject like my brother. My mother used to instruct us both. Con∣stantine was always a serious youth.

</SP>
<SP>

<P>Not so well as with it I believe. The Christians have a curious system, let it come from the Jews, or from any other nation.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arp.</SPEAKER>
<P>What say you? Can that be?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes I affirm that it will be greatly for the interest of our sex to have it prevail.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arp.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why for the interest of our sex?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>No system treats them with so much tenderness and respect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arp.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can you make that appear?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tha.</SPEAKER>
<P>By a fair comparison of facts—You know that women have been abused in various parts of the globe. The Christians say this was predicted from the time that Eve stole the forbidden apples of paradise. Except in Greece, which has always been the seat of learning and politeness; women have been subjected to the arbitrary disposal of the men. And even among them they are by no means so free, as among the Christians.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are they more generous in their principles than our noble Romans?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, the noblest of our Romans claim the right of arbitrary divorce and some of our most celebrated characters have alienated their wives to strangers. In Ger∣many and other nothern nations they are treated as slaves and subjected to the scource. In Asia they are sold like common animals in the market. In Africa they are slaves of a most slavish people.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arp.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how do you know that it is not even so amongst the Christians?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tha.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are several ladies of my acquaintance who have married Christian husbands. They appear very hap∣py—This led me to enquire into their principles, and cus∣toms.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arp.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did you find any thing worthy of notice?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tha</SPEAKER>
<P>I sound, what I thought worthy of notice They maintain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as a principle that woman was created from the substance of ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ and therefore it must be unnatural to abuse her. That marriage is no human law, but a di∣vine
<PB N="420" REF="034600_0410_0FFF35B365E51490"/>
ordinance previous to all human laws. That divorce can never be lawful; but in case of manifest infidelity.— That by marriage a man becomes one, with his wife, in heart, mind, and soul.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arp.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a very happy doctrine; for there are one half of our Romans who treat their wives with less com∣plaisance than they would treat strangers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tha.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is generally the case with ignorant and fool∣ish people. But the Christians teach, That he who loveth his wife, loveth himself; and that he should no more use her ill, than he would abuse himself. That he should be willing to expose his life for her sake, even as Christ died for his church. That he must not give her pain not so much, as by bitter, and reproachful words.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arp.</SPEAKER>
<P>This certainly deserves our attention—A revolu∣tion in religion will be for the interest of our sex—It will be greatly in their favor—That is always good which does good—I will try my influence over some of the young senators—But are you fully informed of this matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tha.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may rest assured that I am, I have spared no pains for information. And I find that the more a christian is attached to his religion the more kind he is to his wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then this shall be the ladies' religion—It will be the happiest of all events for society, and prove of great advantage to our sex, till the latest periods of time.</P>

<HEAD>ANECDOTES—LEADING TO THE UNDERSTAND∣ING OF THE PIECE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>ZENOBIA</HI> was Queen of <HI>Palmyra</HI> — a woman of high spirit, bordering on pride. She was a person of most sub∣lime morals, and fond of her husband to enthusiasm—yet ever declared her attachment was solely founded on his virtues. She was remarkable for her maternal affection, and sense of gratitude. Her husband, perishing in the wars, left her kingdom in a very flourishing condition, which she greatly strengthened by an alliance with the Arabians and Persians. Becoming wealthy and prosperous, she declared herself Queen of the East, and defied the Roman power. The Emperor, after various efforts to gain her to the in∣terests of Rome, subdued her in war; led her in triumph in golden chains, and allowed her to reside a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> one of his vil∣las at <HI>Tibur</HI> in <HI>Italy;</HI> where soon she died of grief and mortification. By the general testimony of historians, AURELIAN had no other cause for making war against her, but her prosperity and grandeur; and by his conduct to her he brought an indelible stain on his memory.</P>
<P><HI>LONGINUS,</HI> her prime minister, was a person no less remarkable. Acquainted with science in general—Versed in all the eminent Pagan and Christian writers—An admir∣er of Moses and St. Paul. He wrote the famous treatise on the Sublime, which has ever since his day been the stan∣dard of criticism, of which POPE gives the following char∣acter—
<Q><L>Thee, bold Longinus, all the Nine inspire;</L>
<L>And fill the critic with a poet's fire.</L>
<L>An ardent judge, who zealous in his trust,</L>
<L>With warmth gives sentence, yet is alway just.</L>
<L>His own example strengthens all his laws;</L>
<L>And is, himself, the great Sublime he draws.</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>PALMYRA</HI> was built by SOLOMON, and by him called <HI>Tadmor.</HI> It was situated in the east part of <HI>Syria,</HI> bordering
<PB N="429" REF="034600_0419_0FFF357D3654C870"/>
on <HI>Chaldea.</HI> Many highways between great and flourishing states▪ centered in this city; which caused it to be a place of great trade. From the fine natural groves around it, preserved for timber, it was antiently called <HI>Tadmor in the Wilderness.</HI> The Romans ruined this city in the year of CHRIST 273—Yet certain ruins, supposed to be of ZENO∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>IA's palace, to this day, astonish beholders with their mag∣nificence, and are esteemed among the greatest curiosities in the world.</P>

<HEAD>Preface TO THE SINGLE PIECES.</HEAD>
<P>THE Editor of this work, having always found it to be one of the most difficult things attending an exhibition, to obtain suitable occasional pieces; whether for the in∣troduction, intermediate speech, or conclusion; thought it best to insert in his book a number of these kinds—Indeed he publishes all that he can collect, at present, of those which he has used.</P>
<P>It is as much impossible to avoid a sameness in the in∣troductory and concluding pieces, as in ordination or elec∣tion sermons, or commencement orations—the intermedi∣ates are not liable to this inconvenience. They may be varied without end—but only one or two of the prologues, or epilogues are used in a year, the sameness may only ap∣pear as they stand in the book, and not in the public use of them.</P>
<P>He has also tho't proper to publish the names of the students to whom single pieces have been assigned, because it would be doing them honor, as none can perform them but such as are, in many respects, good scholars—and none but those of unblemished moral character can have them. The insertion of their names does homage to their genius, improvements, and virtue; and may give them a degree of celebrity, which one day or another may be of use to them. It may also excite ambition of succeeding students, whose performances <HI>may</HI> be published in a second volume.</P>
<P>There will be a seeming inequality among the pieces here given—but both single and dramatic compositions appear differently, publicly performed, from what they do when read in silence—If any do not strike the reader much in private, let him consider, that public representa∣tion is the only test of their merit.</P>
<P><PB N="480" REF="034600_0469_0FFF36039A8B2698"/>The Editor has taken great gains, and even gained the assistance of ladies of learning and approved character, to clear his pieces of all offensive words and passages—yet if one word or passage of this kind shall remain after all, he disavows it—and desires every one who shall make use of his book; to render delicate any passage that offends, as in so doing he will fulfil the intention of the publisher.</P>

our guardians, our brethren, our sisters, and our friends—We have assembled every relation, which is dear to the human heart. It is no vain presumption, which urges us to appear in this place. It is our desire to give you some specimens of those instructions which we have lately received, and we hope to convince you, that we have not wasted our opportunities, and our time. We hope then that you will give us a candid hearing; and that you will not forget, on this occasion those maxims of kindness, on which you have founded the other actions of your lives.</P>
<P>Venerable Matrons and Fathers of families—You will here receive our dutiful acknowledgements, for that pro∣vision, which is made by your generosity, for opening to our minds the treasures of knowledge—Were we capable of the odius vice of ingratitude, we must detest ourselves— We cannot have derived, from you, hearts, that are so de∣generate. Nor have we so little profited by our studies. No, Sires, we reflect on you at one and the same time with love, with reverence, and joy—we hope in some degree, to represent the virtues of our ancestors—But the idea of an∣other part of the assembly, lies very deep in our hearts, and to them, by your permission, we will address ourselves.</P>

<P>The decorum of your sex will not permit you to direct an adress to us collectively in any public place. Happy are we, that we are not restrained by any such decorum from addressing you—The more public our respects are to you, the more fond we are of showing them—Perhaps we may a little regret, that our example in point of learning, and virtues, is not more brilliant; but be assured Ladies, if you will lead in any worthy cause, we shall be happy to follow you. May your smiles this day be the pure eman∣ations of your usual candor and good will Quick as elec∣tric influence, the marks of your approbation will affect every heart with the most lively joy; but we deprecate your frowns, they will blast all our hopes in a moment— We trust, you are never severe but by the commands of virtue—As our present request opposes no principles of delicacy, we trust it will be granted—You will hear us with candor, and will encourage us in every worthy pur∣suit.</P>

You cannot easily blame our emotions— You have loved them; and you know they deserved it— They have doubtless, caused you many a delightful hour— But perhaps the remaining part of their life is more in∣teresting to us than to you. It will add to the felicity of virtue to travel her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aths, in the most delightful company.</P>

<HEAD>THE RESTORATION OF ABDERA. A POEM, Spoken by way of <HI>PROLOGUE,</HI> to the <HI>EXHIBITION,</HI>
<DATE>Sept. <HI>26. 1794.</HI></DATE>
At the end of the <HI>SUMMER TERM.</HI></HEAD>
<BYLINE>By Miss SUSANNA UNDERWOOD.</BYLINE>
<L>IN ancient Greece, so much in story famed,</L>
<L>A ruinous city stood, Abdera named.</L>
<L>Its people, most degenerate and base,</L>
<L>Were tho't a scandal to the human race.</L>
<L>For murders, poisons; and all deeds of spite.</L>
<L>One could not walk by day—'twas worse by night.</L>
<L>Great Sophocles, skilled in poetic art,</L>
<L>To warm the fancy, and to mend the heart;</L>
<L>Saw his vile citizens with keenest grief,</L>
<L>Determined on a sudden, sure relief.</L>
<L>High in the public forum of the town,</L>
<L>With lyre in hand, and poet's laurel crown,</L>
<L>He stood; while near him crowds impatient move,</L>
<L>And sung in verse divine the POWER OF LOVE.</L>
<L>He sung its tender influence on the heart,</L>
<L>The soft infection of the gentle dart;</L>
<L>Its power to change the fiercest human breast;</L>
<L><PB N="485" REF="034600_0474_0FFF363F9AD70478"/>Forming a man, where first he found a beast;</L>
<L>How the rough warrior leaves the fields of death,</L>
<L>Rejects the laurel, for the myrtle wreath;</L>
<L>To ravished sceptres and false glory blind,</L>
<L>Adopts a mate, and edifies mankind.</L>
<L>The fine poetic thro th' assembly ran,</L>
<L>The magic power, was caught from man to man.</L>
<L>Soft gentle sighs were breathed from hearts sincere;</L>
<L>On every cheek was seen the tender tear.</L>
<L>The poet ceased. All to their homes returned,</L>
<L>Yet in their breasts still love impatient burned.</L>
<L>Till Hymen came to vanquish all their cares,</L>
<L>And bind the gentle, softened race, in pairs.</L>
<L>As from soft showers expands the blooming rose,</L>
<L>Thus fair Abdera from her ruin shows.</L>
<L>How changed, how bright, the gladsome city shone!</L>
<L>Murders and deeds of malice all were flown.</L>
<L>Poisons no more conveyed the secret death,</L>
<L>And useless daggers rusted in the sheath.</L>
<L>To deeds malicious, not a heart could move;</L>
<L>For how should malice dwell with gentle love?</L>
<L>Oft in the street were seen the sportive throng,</L>
<L>The wedding feast was ranged, the birthday song</L>
<L>Was heard melodious. All the arts revive;</L>
<L>Those arts by which a family might thrive.</L>
<L>Dire wars no more were heard. 'Twas all their care,</L>
<L>To cheer a wife, a family to rear.</L>
<L>Wealth with vast stores on industry awaits;</L>
<L>And swarms of people pour from all her states.</L>
<L>Abdera, famed to earth's remotest ends,</L>
<L>To distant climes her colonies extends.</L>
<L>Her offspring, who to farthest regions rove,</L>
<L>Spread wide the blessings of the arts, and love.</L>
<L>Such our brave fathers, who from distant lands,</L>
<L>Avoiding persecution's iron bands,</L>
<L>To fair Columbia's distant plains repair,</L>
<L>While human happiness was all their care.</L>
<L>First 'twas their view that virtues plant their breast,</L>
<L>Next, each shares equal freedom with the rest.</L>
<L>Then to bind f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st the sacred bands of love;</L>
<L>And teach the passion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, by just laws, to move.</L>

<L>Whence beauty's blossoms open to the day,</L>
<L>Whence the strong youth who fates of nation's sway.</L>
<L>While all the arts, whence men their fortunes share,</L>
<L>In full, and splendid m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>jesty appear.</L>
<L>To west, departing from the rising morn,</L>
<L>No happy lands the spacious globe adorn.</L>
<L>Where fuller blossoms of fair science rise,</L>
<L>Or sweeter female forms delight our eyes,</L>
<L>Or bolder youth bright freedom's cause to own,</L>
<L>And dash the frowning tyrant from his throne?</L>
<L>So falls each public foe beneath their stroke,</L>
<L>As the fierce thunder fells the mountain oak—</L>
<L>Thus love and arts proceeding hand in hand,</L>
<L>Form the vast glories of our native land—</L>
<L>Yet, pardon, Sophocles our bard excels,</L>
<L>Presents the real fact, not simply tells—</L>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MOST RESPECTABLE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF we do not address you at this time, with extreme timidity, if we do not discover that anxiety, which your respectability appears sufficient to inspire—it is not from any want of respect to you. But it is owing to that per∣fect liberality and candor with which you have favored our performances in time past, we have hearts full of senti∣ments towards you, such as become the most favored children—but we do not fear, that on any trifling fault you will manifest the expressions of anger or contempt. Yet your sentiments are by no means indifferent to us—It is one of the greatest pleasures of our life to merit your approbation. Our youthful hearts are elate with the pros∣pect, that by means of your kind parental care, (Heaven forbid that we ever should abuse it,) we shall so conduct ourselves, as to increase your happiness—that we not only have your approbation in these exercises, but that you may highly enjoy our behavior in all the scenes of life.</P>
<P>Life indeed is sweet, and it is pleasant to the eyes to behold the sun, and survey the various beauties of nature— hence we freely own that the debt, due to a parent, for mere existence, and early nutrition, is more than any child can pay—But, how immense is the obligation to parents

—who take all imaginable pains to make their children happy—who afford them the most rational pleasures; and the most sublime enjoyments of life—Compare my worthy seniors, and most respected ladies, the girl who is the mere child of simplicity—of unformed sentiments and manners, with one who has been favored with a good ed∣ucation—compare such an one with those, who lately, in this place, displayed a variety of brilliant performances— Who completely sustained the most amiable and polite characters—who fastened your attention, and left you no power to recall it, and gave you the <HI>graces</HI> and the <HI>morals</HI> united in the most charming alliance—make the compar∣ison—then let any one, if he can, deny the advantages of education.</P>
<P>At present indulge us, worthy parents, to speak to those who are delightful to us—This evening we are deprived of your most pleasing company and assistance in our per∣formances, yet still you are near to our hearts and live in them—your presence excites our lively ambition—we shall read the expression of your countenances and the lan∣guage of your eyes with modest fear of being unaccepta∣ble; and with lively joy, if we discern your approbation.</P>
<P>Happy are they, and the happiest of human kind—who unite the love of virtue and goodness with their mutual affections; and form a lasting alliance—to know this we need only consider the respectable lives of the matron<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in this assembly—their full praise we leave to their husbands, tho as children, with promptest hearts, we rise up and call them blessed: their various duties discharged with so much fidelity and attention—cannot but be attended with the most delightful reflections.</P>
<P>Now parents, brethren, sisters and friends, favor us with your usual candor, politeness and attention—and we will not only endeavor to escape your censure, but we shall (for our ambition is great) even hope to gain your appro∣bation.</P>

<L>Who wears sweet majesty and looks at heaven.</L>
<L>Ah! lives there one, who with capricious deed</L>
<L>Would wound those hearts where youth and softness bleed;</L>
<L>Where each attractive grace, and fenceless charm,</L>
<L>Seeks the protection of a stronger arm?</L>

<L>Each parent, brother, sister, lover, friend—</L>

<P>IT is with the sincerest gratitude to our worthy parents; that we now present ourselves in this place—<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was the first time that the Gentlemen and Ladies were allowed to exhibit together.</NOTE> Nothing could afford greater satisfaction to the young gentlemen of this society, than the confidence reposed in us by the par∣ents

of those amiable beings who are now permitted to unite their studious excercises with ours—We realize, most intensely, this delicate trust—and we pledge ourselves to you that we will not abuse it—We cannot wonder at the precaution, with which you granted this indulgence—It is certainly right to be careful of riches, whose value cannot be estimated—and which <HI>once lost</HI> can never be recovered— We shall convince you that you may safely trust with us what is most valuable to you—It would be just, should we be forever unhappy, if we deceive you—Neither shall the amiable manners of our young ladies, be in the least im∣paired by their associating with us—nor their minds be perverted by the exercises of this place—Our object is, not to present to you dry precepts; but living images of vir∣tue—to show you its effects, in real life. Will the behav∣ior of our young ladies disgust you if they behave, as dis∣creet, virtuous, and polite ladies do in the course of a prof∣itable life? If they do, then virtue itself is disgusting.</P>
<P>Or if we in any instance represent vice, it shall bear its characteristic marks of odium, and there shall be no dan∣ger of its being imitated—we shall endeavor to abstain from every thing, which may offend the nicest delicacy, or the purest virtue—however we intreat all reasonable candor—we ask that we may not be judged by harsher maxims, than are generally adopted by persons of a just sense of piety, virtue, and good breeding—we must still represent human beings and human passions. Some of the characters we represent must appear subject to the common f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ibles of human nature—but we trust that if nothing is spoken which wounds the ear of modesty—if no action be shown which offends the zealous votaries of virtue—if the pieces shall each contain traits of the most useful moral and religious instruction—besides many just and instructive representations of human nature and the passion; if the fair blossoms of beauty be not sullied by any thing that is rude and unbecoming; but preserve their perfect sweetness; after exhibiting innumerable charms of personal elegance, of genius, learning, and graceful motion—if these things shall be as we trust we can show you the fact—we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave the ambitious hope, that we shall not only escape censure—but even secure your servent approbation.</P>

<L>MY gentle Sires now shall a little maid,</L>
<L>Tho much indulged, yet more than half afraid,</L>
<L>Approach your presence. Let her modest prayer</L>
<L>Now reach your hearts, and find indulgence there:</L>
<L>Let me with all this timerous, lovely band</L>
<L>Your wonted candor, and regard demand.</L>
<L>Cherished by you, we show in virtue's line</L>
<L>How heaven hath blessed your generous design,</L>
<L>While you the means of learning shall impart,</L>
<L>A thousand virtues fill the female heart.</L>
<L>Where knowledge shall disclose her plenteous store,</L>
<L>There, lovely woman stoops to vice no more.</L>
<L>If hireling actresses their scenes have shamed;</L>
<L>And woman's virtue is by them defamed.</L>
<L>What's that to us; who neither say nor do,</L>
<L>What might offend the purest souls like you—</L>
<L>If frowning critics would our souls affright,</L>
<L>And say we boldly rush upon your sight,</L>
<L>Nay, but we follow honor's, duty's, call,</L>
<L>And, not invited, should not come at all.</L>
<L>For us the kindest cares when parents show,</L>
<L>Past every doubt; they have a right to know,</L>
<L>If all their kindest, worthiest deeds are vain—</L>
<L>Or they a parent's just applause may gain.</L>
<L>To virtue only we attention claim,</L>
<L>Our stage is but the path to honest fame.</L>
<L>Attention then we ask, if that we gain,</L>
<L>The liveliest pleasure pays our studious pain—</L>
<L>Not eager censure then shall find a place,</L>
<L>Nor blush of shame shall stain the fairest face;</L>
<L>If every word, which shall our tho't display,</L>
<L>Be soft as dews of heaven, and pure as they.</L>
<L>On your kind hearts our hopes securely rest,</L>
<L>Soft pity always fills a mother's breast—</L>

<L>And share a daughter's bliss, or daughter's woe.</L>
<L>Your gentle smiles will our young hearts assure,</L>
<L>That they the terrors of their task endure.</L>
<L>Your countenance shall smooth the critic's frown,</L>
<L>Till just success the lovely band shall crown.</L>
<L>Your hearts shall throb with pleasures sweet and new,</L>
<L>To see your virtues rise again to view.</L>
<L>And the fair daughter of a beauteous wife,</L>

<L>Who blessed our youth with parents, good and wise.</L>
<L>Who rear their offspring with the kindest care,</L>
<L>Nor cast their blossoms to the desart air.</L>
<L>To show'r his blessings on each parent head,</L>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE, to the <HI>WINTER EXHIBITION, 1797.</HI></HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MR. JOSEPH RUSSELL, of Weston.</BYLINE>
<P>PERMIT me, with that modesty which becomes a youth, to state the plan of our present Exhibition—We do not ex∣pert to excell, in the art of speaking, those who have made it their business and profession—Nor is the mere entertain∣ment of the audience, our principal object. Those persons mistake us extremely who think we mean to be imitators of a theatre—Indeed we speak &amp; have dramatic pieces; so they have on the theatre. On the theatre also men walk &amp; breathe. But is it a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ime to walk or breathe, because actors and actresses breathe and walk, as well as others—No, nor is it a crime to speak a piece in dramatic form if the object be good—The object of a theatre is amusement; that of a
<PB N="494" REF="034600_0483_0FFF36179AC59788"/>
school should always be instruction. All our performances are intended to illustrate certain important principles of morality; and to show what virtue is my means of living examples—While we are doing this, we hope to make some progress in the art of speaking—Of this we readily allow there is great necessity.</P>
<P>Did you here behold a set of actors who profess to en∣tertain the public, you might have both right and cause for criticism; but here you have a set of modest timid scholars who have passed but little time in the pursuits of learning—Yet they are willing to perform as well as they can; that their friends may be able to discern whether they have, or have not, improved their means and advan∣tages.</P>
<P>Bearing this in mind, you will make great allowance for the extreme youth and inexperience of the students. Our pieces at this time, are not the most diverting; but such as best illustrate the moral sentiments which we would impress upon the young mind, and which may give a proper direction to the movements of the youthful heart.</P>
<P>We are encouraged in our arduous enterprize by con∣sidering the characters of which this audience is composed. Those respectable ladies whom we call by the endeared name of mother, will have no disposition to damp our spir∣its, or fully our performances: kindness is the ruling pas∣sions of your hearts, and the same tender affection will be∣friend us here; which bore with the patience of the saints, the cares which attended our infancy &amp; the petulance and follies of our childhood—You will now look with charity on the imperfect performances of our youth, you will be exceedingly pleased if we do well; and this encourages the attempt— Not that we can recompense you for your good∣ness—That must he left to Him, whose goodness is abso∣lutely without bounds.</P>
<P>Deign, venerable fathers, to soften for a moment the gravity of age; and unbend the awful brow of parental authority, that you smile on the children of your care—If you set the example to all the people of this assembly of keeping us in spirit and encouraging our endeavors, we hope to perform something that will please you.</P>

<BYLINE>By MR. NATHAN MERIAM.</BYLINE>
<P>NO person can reasonably wonder that we should be in∣timidated by your presence. If you find us fearful and dis∣concerted in coming before persons of so august an appear∣ance, we trust you will not blame us—We are as you see, many of us young scholars, young indeed to pretend to give an exhibition to such an assembly—You will find ma∣ny things in our performances which will need excuse, some perhaps which you can only pardon; and yet we hope you will find some that will please you.</P>
<P>We doubt not, venerable fathers, of your affection—You naturally wish to find us doing right—The care which you have shewn that your children be educated in a manner becoming to themselves and useful to society, is a pledge of your kind regards to us this moment.</P>
<P>There is a pleasure in this idea, that we have an oppor∣tunity to recommend ourselves to you; and this pleasure in good degree takes away the sense of fear. How happy shall we be, to hear you say hereafter, that your children are less a burden than a pleasure to you; and that you have been the happier, by such blessings—as many would willingly refuse.</P>
<P>And surely we must not forget those who are as much interested in our being, and happiness, as you—You, virtu∣ous and amiable ladies, are extremely dear to us—and you command the sublime respect of all who are knowing to your virtues—We have a great resource for courage—We are assured that you will not blame any thing which you can excuse—the maternal heart will never change—We shall find you benevolent, ready to extenuate our failures, and to mag∣nify our merits—We hope for the happiness of being agree∣able to you.</P>
<P>You will not oblige us to forget those who are the pride and ornament of your respectable families and of this semi∣nary of learning—Such as <HI>you</HI> ever have been and ever
<PB N="496" REF="034600_0485_0FFF361B082F17C0"/>
will be the delight of human kind. Never shall your prai∣ses be passed over in silence. Never shall your smiles or tokens of complacency be despised, till time shall be no more—Beauty united with virtue such as you possess; and are determined you always will possess; will have its influ∣ence till the universe shall die—Order must cease in crea∣tion; and all sense of excellence be lost, among intelligent beings; before the beauty, and virtues of such as you, shall cease to he admired; or any of your brilliant and useful qualities be forgotten. I am sensible I speak with ardor— Yet ardor becomes a youth in addressing himself to you. It is even more decent than the cold correctness of a phi∣losopher—but not the most correct or coldest philosopher can blame our lively emotions in addressing ourselves to you. To objects, to persons, so worthy of the most interesting re∣gards of human kind.</P>
<P>My fellow students, we are young, unpractised scholars —but let us have courage. These persons come to see us with the most benevolent designs—They wish to see us perform well—They will I trust do nothing which shall prevent it—They will regard us with the most friendly countenances—And let us beseech you—our friends of the assembly; that if you shall hear any thing which▪ shall displease you; that you would repress, for the moment, all visible tokens of dislike—and till you have seen the whole of the exercises, occasional tokens of contempt shown in an audience, damp the firmest performer; and put out of coun∣tenance all who come after him; your candor and polite∣ness will induce you to refrain. Then, with all our hearts, we will use our utmost endeavor to please you.</P>

<HEAD>AN APOLOGY FOR STUDIOUS LADIES, At the <HI>LADIES' EXHIBITION</HI>

<OPENER><SALUTE>RESPECTABLE GENTLEMEN, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Addressed to the visitors of the school.</NOTE></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is not unknown to you, how much wit has been scat∣tered on the subject of the loquacity of women—and how
<PB N="499" REF="034600_0488_0FFF36510534BF98"/>
much satire expended in ridiculing ladies who have a taste for learning—but if an eminent faculty of speech be pos∣sessed by women, for once let it be employed to a good purpose—let us plead the cause of a sex, who by nature are too feeble to employ force; and by principle too vir∣tuous to use fraud, to accomplish their designs. My apology is for those young ladies, who wish to excel in endowments of the mind—will it be thought a crime, or a breach of modesty to enquire; why such an attempt should be liable to censure—especially as it cannot arise from mal∣ice to any person whatever—if we be exposed to at least an equal share of the miseries of life, ought we to be sep∣arated from its most sublime, and most constant delights? Does not the condition of a lady require, as much as any, the delightful amusement of elegant essays, of poetry and music? Has she no need of that firmness of mind which philosophy inspires? Would not the sublime consolations of religion greatly increase her happiness? But these are enjoyed in their full force only by an enlightened mind —In a rural retirement, a solitary dwelling, and silence all around her, her most agreeable friends being abroad on business, to have these ideas crowd upon the mind, with which she has been inspired by the fine arts, by philoso∣phy and religion, must assuredly be a great consolation.</P>
<P>But it is said, that it will make all our women dissipat∣ed and idle—how does this apear? Do men who have wives well educated in point of learning prosper in their affairs less than others—ask those gentlemen of this assem∣dly whose wives have been the best educated, whether they find them to be less attentive to domestic concerns, or worse economists than the others—May not more women be trusted with knowledge, as well as these. Or is there any fear that women shall gain too much influence; and be∣come mistressess of the world in spite of man? When we shall quit our domestic employments, put on offensive armor, and become fond of the art of war, then such an event may be feared; and not till then—Power derived from force is denied to women by the God of Nature.</P>
<P>The graces, the virtues, the art of pleasing, are the on∣ly ways by which women can influence the minds and actions of men—the fear of those who hold learning to be d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gerou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to ladies amounts to this—that they are afraid that they shall be too much attracted; that their reason
<PB N="500" REF="034600_0489_0FFF367BCBB25E98"/>
will force them to approve of the conduct of the ladies, and that they shall be attached to the ladies, even against their own inclination. If the ladies then wish to indulge a stroke of policy let it be this: to gain the approbation of those who censure us; &amp; to make even satirists confess, that we act with propriety—this is perfectly consistent with our principles—and there is nothing more conducive to this purpose than the information, which the arts afford—we may safely acquire as much knowledge, as our situation in life will admit, opposing to the geniuses of the age, who ridicule the studies of women, the sentiment of Cicero;
<Q>While other pursuits suit not to all ages, and stations; that of learning agrees to all. It strengthens the minds of youth, and gives joy in old age—It adorns prosperity, and comforts us in affliction—at home it is delightful, and it is a help to business abroad—it attends us in our travels, and is the joy of our rural retirements—and tho we ourselves were incapable of the arts, we should still admire them, and be captivated with their charms, when we beheld them in others.</Q></P>

<L>WHAT! then, I see your eyes are turned on me—</L>
<L>And you may wonder well, at what you see.</L>
<L>What means this little fairy—Has she to do</L>
<L>A dialogue, or make a speech that's new?</L>
<L>Fine times indeed when such are bro't to view.</L>
<L>I come indeed to speak; but what to say,</L>
<L>Aye there's the task—Suppose I talk away</L>
<L>Of marriage, husbands, wives, the virtuous joy</L>
<L>Of hopeful families, which their minds employ—</L>
<L>Indeed dear Sirs—'tis all beyond my line—</L>
<L>But if I talk it answers my design.</L>

<L><PB N="501" REF="034600_0490_0FFF36A08A9EB830"/>They're serpents all and thou the tempted Eve.</L>
<L>On this by rote I any thing can say;</L>

<L>Indeed I am a prudent mistress quite,</L>
<L>For if I think on't, I'll do what is right.</L>
<L>Be prudent grand ma'am says, should be my song,</L>

<L>Or if I act the prude—Then I can feign,</L>

<L>Then I'll pretend I never can abide,</L>
<L>A whining lover canting at my side—</L>
<L>Can turn my nose up, if a swain goes by,</L>
<L>Yet when he's past can cast an anxious eye.</L>
<L>Or be a lady quite in love; and then</L>
<L>Nothing's so dear as that sweet gentleman—</L>
<L>O happy me! my fortune could I try,</L>
<L>With such a lovely swain to live, and die—</L>
<L>Ah me, I feel the force of Cupid's dart—</L>
<L>The charming shepherd! O! I've lost my heart.</L>
<L>My Papa frowns—What lost your heart, my dear?</L>
<L>O no, dear sir, here 'tis, I feel it here.</L>
<L>Now for a change, like lady Smart I'll be—</L>
<L>There's not a swain that's good enough for me.</L>
<L>I'll dance, dress fine, and all must please me still,</L>

<L>And if I wed I'll manage to perfection—</L>

<HEAD>THE BENEFITS OF LEARNING ARE AB∣SOLUTE. The <HI>INTERMEDIATE SPEECH</HI> at the <HI>GENTLEMEN'S EXHIBITION,</HI>
<DATE>March <HI>25</HI>th, <HI>1795.</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MR. CHARLES WHEELER.</BYLINE>
<P>IT becomes my duty now to present myself before you; and perhaps I cannot do it better than to show the merits of learning—This subject has been variously treated by others; but I propose to myself a track, new and untrod∣den before. My design is not to prove that learning is a benefit, but that it is necessary—I shall not pretend to show that we can do very well with it; but we cannot do with∣out it—whatever a man learns is a part of learning—And I leave you to judge whether a man can render himself conspicuous or useful without learning any <HI>thing</HI>—For he who learns one thing, to say that what another learns is useless—is judging out of his line, and is, probaby, judg∣ing wrong.</P>
<P>There are two means by which men become conspicuous in the world: one is by gifts of nature, and the other by suit∣able education—mere natural qualities without education, have indeed an intrinsic value, but like a diamond, rude from the mine, are rough and unpleasing, while education without natural powers, is weak and ineffectual—but when to good natural qualities there succeeds a good and prop∣er education, that presents human nature in its brightest glory.</P>
<P>Alas, what is man, divested of the sciences and all those arts for which learning is necessary—a stupid staring, un∣couth animal, centred in himself and selfish gratifications. Say that he can neither write, nor read, that he knows nothing of numbers, and that he cannot speak without offending the hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er—divest him also of the mechanic arts; for they originate in philosophy, and skill in hus∣bandry, for that also is a branch of learning—what is he? a mere savage, a kind of brute, a little handsomer in∣deed, than his brother bears in the woods—but as much
<PB N="503" REF="034600_0492_0FFF116CB4395AB0"/>
without morals, as much a prey to his passions; what would distinguish him chiefly from them, is, that he is ca∣pable of improvement.</P>
<P>Surely then, the consequence is obtained by clear reason∣ing that he ought to be improved; and the benefit of making progress is as easily discernible—if one degree of knowledge (supposing a man's heart innocent) makes him better, another makes him better still; and so on to infin∣ity.</P>
<P>What is the reason, that we are so unfeeling to each others rights, and so often injure each other in society—it is because we are deficient in two points of learning—1st we have never learned to govern ourselves—next because we have never been taught to respect one another. There is not a single virtue, but must first be known before it can be practised—nor a single vice which we shall avoid unless we know how it is done.</P>
<P>It is a very great error in any person to suppose, that the gratifications of mere corporeal senses are superior to the pleasures of the mind and imagination—that they ex∣ceed the sublime delights of intense friendship, of sincere and virtuous love, the noble flights of the imagination, the pleasure of useful knowledge, and the heartfelt whis∣pers of an approving conscience—yet this error, is com∣mon to men in a rude uncultivated state, the gross indul∣gence of appetite, and the unbounded rage of their passions, being almost the only delights of which they form any idea.</P>
<P>But, if the ardor for knowledge which at present exists in our nation shall continue—we hope soon to see the day, when it shall be rare to see a youth deliver himself up to riot, and inebriation—when the instance shall be still rarer, that under the color of love and good will—he shall in∣troduce vice and contamination into a once innocent and happy family, and when to get an office, in order, to be∣tray the public, shall be utterly unknown—we hope that education shall have such force, that the objects of desire, shall be perfectly innocent and harmless enjoyments—that the intention of wealth shall be usefulness; when love shall bless the object of its flame; and ambition shall aim at the good of a nation, and at mankind.</P>

<P>I HOPE to meet with the countenance &amp; encouragement of this assembly, while I attempt a theme of which, I trust, all will confess the utility. I would speak the praises of a long and heavy purse—Well stuffed with substantial coin— While Orations are made on all other subjects of all kinds
<PB N="507" REF="034600_0496_0FFF365376B42298"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it seems quite improper that this should be neglected. The present scarcity of cash, must give peculiar force to the arguments with which this theme abounds—It is gener∣ally the scarcity of any thing, which is valuable, which ef∣fectually teaches us to esteem it—Who then can be more sensible than we are of the value of that ready assistant in all manner of business? Some have asserted that it is in the power of money to do anything—That it can change vice into imaginary virtue, and deformity into beauty—But while we are speaking in this respectable assembly; we have nothing to say of vice, but that it exists not here—and while we are addressing this lovely choir of ladies, to mention de∣formity would be straying wide from the purpose— It will not be denied, that with the perfection of beauty, it is very well to possess a handsome interest in pecuniary matters—It makes the heart cheerful, and the business of life easy—It is written of Mrs. Primrose the celebrated wife of the Vicar of Wakefield, that she would have her daughters each carry in her pocket a guinea, without ever changing it, to keep them in spirits. If a single guinea has such virtue, what may not be expected from a long and heavy purse, well stuffed with them? It must doubtless do wonders. There are those who maintain that many evils arise from the length, and heaviness of the purse—That it makes prodigals of young heirs; and instigates them to all manner of excesses. But that their purse is not to be blamed may readily be proved from o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e easy supposition. Money is just as willing to do good as to do evil, nay it answers its own purpose best by being the instrument of happiness to human-kind—If it does, a man's money is no more to blame for his crimes than his bodily strength for his committing murder— For my part tho I have never experienced so much of the benefit of money, as some men have, yet the little I have had has done me so much good, that I most earnestly desire to have more, and I shall think it strange if you doubt of my sincerity in this assertion—I have a strong imagination that if I had a great fortune I should do much good with it—And if I could handsomely come to the possession of an affluent estate—I have so much confidence in my own integrity, that I should not be afraid to trust myself with it. And while I am wishing for a great plenty of money myself, I cannot help wishing that my neighbors had more
<PB N="508" REF="034600_0497_0FFF3688B89F6C20"/>
than they have, and in this respect I hope I have the hap∣piness of coinciding with their own ideas. I will allow that virtue is of more value than money—for virtue can procure money, but money cannot buy virtue—I will also allow health to be better than cash: because without health we cannot enjoy our money—but money is the third great blessing of human life. Therefore, Ladies and gentlemen —that you may all have the consolations of virtue—the blessings of health, and the convenience of a plenty of Dol∣lars—and that I may have my full share of each, is the hearty desire of your very humble Servant.</P>

<L>THE summer's pleasing season now is past,</L>
<L>And autumn chills us with his rigid blast;</L>
<L>Let us reflect what prudence we have learned—</L>
<L>What wisdom in the summer months discerned.</L>
<L>I've heard a tragic tale—Tho grief remain,</L>
<L>Yet if we learn discretion that is gain.</L>
<L>Two LILLIES of the fairest virgin hue,</L>
<L>In the same vale nigh to each other grew;</L>
<L>One gave her beauties to the blaze of day,</L>
<L>From the bold gaze the other turned way;</L>
<L>And if a savage figure chanced to pass,</L>
<L>Would veil her beauties in surrounding grass;</L>
<L>Thro this same vale one most unhappy day,</L>
<L>A lordly BEAR, slow sauntering, found his way.</L>
<L>The forward flower, impatient to be seen,</L>
<L>Displayed the beauties of her shape and mein.</L>
<L>Turned on her stem to meet his haughty eyes,</L>
<L>And bade the sweetest gales of fragrance rise.</L>
<L>A leaf he cropped, but scarcely owned 'twas sweet,</L>
<L>Then trod the beauteous flower beneath his feet.</L>
<L><PB N="509" REF="034600_0498_0FFF3655F33E5CC8"/>Warned by her sister's fate, the living flower</L>
<L>Grew still more cautious each succeeding hour;</L>
<L>And if a brutal creature came in sight,</L>
<L>Would close her leaves, and veil her beauties quite.</L>
<L>At last a FLORSIT came, the meads to trace;</L>
<L>True friend to flowers, and guardian of their race.</L>
<L>She heard his honest fame in whispering gales,</L>
<L>Which bore the fragrance of the blossomed vales.</L>
<L>'Tis true, each bee, each bird, each insect said,</L>
<L>Which on the sweetness of his garden fed.</L>
<L>As gently he drew nigh, with looks serene,</L>
<L>The flower, tho modest, ventured to be seen.</L>
<L>With gentle touch, and gentler breath, it's true,</L>
<L>Partly, her beauties met his raptured view,</L>
<L>Her lovely colors beaming on his sight,</L>
<L>Her fragrance filled his sense with keen delight.</L>
<L>With gentlest hand he reared her tender head;</L>
<L>And soon transplanted to his choicest bed.</L>
<L>Where nursed with all his cares by days and hours,</L>
<L>She filled his garden with the sweetest flowers.</L>
<L>Ye LILLIES sweet, of fair Columbia's vale,</L>
<L>Learn safe instruction from the moral tale.</L>
<L>Let modest caution always be your care—</L>
<L>And tho you love a FLORIST, shun a BEAR.</L>

<HEAD>VALEDICTORY ADDRESS, at the <HI>YOUNG GENTLEMEN'S EXHIBITION,</HI>

<BYLINE>By MR. SAMUEL HOAR.</BYLINE>
<OPENER><SALUTE>RESPECTABLE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THIS ASSEMBLY.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS band of Brothers, the young gentlemen of the school▪ now present to you their most sincere thanks, for the candid and pleasing attention with which you have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avored our performances.</P>
<P>We shall believe that you love virtue, and are disposed to encourage learning; by the friendly countenance which you have given to both—It is the intention of the young gentlemen ever to deserve your approbation. Permit me, my bretheren, to express what I believe to be your senti∣ments, to this assembly—You are determined to pursue those methods of life; by which you may be respectable in yourselves, and useful to society—We will ever (I trust you will support me in the assertion) maintain a grateful sense of the various means by which our kind parents have la∣bored for our happiness. The fair advantages for acquir∣ing useful knowledge, the kind instructions we have receiv∣ed from our nearest relations, and from this school, lead us to virtue, and to real praise. We do not place our happi∣ness, worthy parents and friends, in riot, and debauchery
<PB N="515" REF="034600_0504_0FFF365BC599BF10"/>
—We have no imagination, that noisy revels, gaming par∣ties, scenes of lewdness, or low knavery, are calculated to convey joy and happiness to the soul—We do not im∣agine that to despise the counsels of parents, to contract habits of impiety and profanity, which are always attended with savageness of manners, are ways to gain esteem Nor have we formed any idea of happiness as existing in tran∣sient sensations of joy, or mirth succeeded by the severest remorse—No—We suppose that probity is honor, and that virtue is happiness.</P>
<P>Speaking of happiness, an idea occurs intima<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly connec∣ted therewith. It is that of conversing with those whose gra∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s &amp; virtues and beauties necessarily excite felicity—we be∣lieve the sacred text, which saith, that after the supreme had formed ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, he from the substance of the man, and from materials taken <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear his heart, formed another being more beautiful, more graceful, more lovely— We believe it for we feel to this day the sensible anguish of that primi∣tive wound, nor do we expect that our hearts shall know settled tranquility, or we have permanent happiness of the soul, till the materials, ravished by the divine hand, from the very springs of life, be restored to their native seat—We hope, ladies, to convince you, that to be near our heats, is to live at your proper home.</P>
<P>Yet think not, therefore, that those here present, whose families are illuminated with many of those brightest gems of beauty, need secure those treasures from our approach. Need you defend them by bolts, or bars, or brazen walls? We have no idea that there can be love, where there is a de∣sign to destroy: we suppose that it might as truly be said of the hawk that he loves the trembling bird, whom he pierces with his cruel talons—of the wolf that he loves the lamb when he sucks her reeking blood—as that the perfidious traitor loves the innocent and blooming maiden; when he seeks to ruin her best interests, and to fully her spotless fame. Let that heart perish which harbors a savave selfish desire, burning only to destroy. Our idea of love is that of a most innocent harmless kind affection; seeking always the good of its object, like that of the guardian angel over the precious saint, by heaven committed to his care— In respect to these amiable beings, whom we must ever ad∣mire and esteem, you will ever, I trust, find our conduct to be void of blame.</P>
<P><PB N="516" REF="034600_0505_0FFF36951FAD11E0"/>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w young ladies, you perceive, that we have entirely cut ourselves off from the refuge of lies, we have been telling your parents, a precious plausible story, how good, how honest and how harmless we mean to be, in all our conver∣sation with you—It happens that you are so near as to hear every word—we have now no advantage to deceive you; and should we attempt any wicked sophistry—you would confute us from our own mouths—yes, ladies, you have that advantage over us, nor do we wish to recal it: keep it and make the utmost of it, you can. We will further tell you, and our hearts witness it to be true,—that every injury from a man to a woman, proceeds from open, or secret contempt; from a mind careless of your best interests, and actuated by mean and selfish motives—reverence your∣selves ladies, and it will be impossible that we should not respect and love you.</P>
<P>But need we become your advisers—you know these things; these sentiments are conformable to your daily practice. What respect, what admiration have not your accomplishments, your graces and virtues, inspired. All eyes, ranks acd professions, of men, speak of you with pleasure and say—How accomplished and how virtu∣ous are the young ladies of these days—We hope the time is rapidly advancing, when the parents shall no more shed bitter tears for the weakness of a daughter; nor a brother, by a sister's fault, feel the venomed sting of infamy in his heart—When there shall be no more hurting or destroying, in all the land, of innocent and virtuous love.</P>
<P>FRIENDS OF THE ASSEMBLY, AT LARGE,</P>
<P>The moral, all the social and virtuous affections, are strengthened by the cultivation of the liberal arts—Nay, by education we may turn the whole force of habit, on the side of virtue, and real religion. This matter seems to be better understood now than formerly, and instead of mere language &amp; the more abstract sciences, it becomes more generally the practice in schools to instill into the minds of youth the principles of religion and morals. Instead of considering religion and virtue as the restraints and let∣ters of the mind—they are regarded as the helm and com∣pass, to convey us to happiness, thro the boisterous ocean of human affairs. The moral part of science; and those which affect the heart▪ are much more studied than in former times—and the charming sex are advancing from a state of
<PB N="517" REF="034600_0506_0FFF366029041770"/>
comparative slavery thro want of education, to be the eq∣ual friends and companions of men—They are now treated as the sisters and not the slaves of the other sex—May the great God of heaven preserve us from the horrid calami∣ties of war; and give our plans of education time to ripen, and be pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fected▪ and we trust that the rising states of Am∣erica shall eclipse in ther glory all the nations of the east —and be a name and praise to God, in the earth.</P>

<P>THE manner of your receiving the performances of this evening, sufficiently demonstrates that your disposition to favor the enterprizings of learning remains unchanged— We repay your candor with the most fervent gratitude.</P>
<P>The politeness of our visiting assemblies is a comfort and encouragement to the students. We feel a delightful security that those who are our observers will receive with pleasure every thing that is well performed, and with ten∣derness
<PB N="522" REF="034600_0511_0FFF369AA6867510"/>
of heart regard all our defects. Happy children, whom a gracious providence has provided with parents of such a temper. We should be unworthy the name of hu∣manity, if we should be ungrateful for such a blessing.</P>
<P>We feel a disadvantage by way of comparison—only a few weeks ago you saw on this stage, such performances as had a peculiar advantage to attract the attention. We can∣not doubt that the benign countenance of so full an audience was greatly owing to the assistance of those amiable young ladies, who then united the sublime and beautiful in their performances.</P>
<P>Animated by your presence; assisted by all that was amiable; we exceeded our proper selves, and shone with the reflected rays of genius and beauty. All experiments, ladies, prove that we cannot attain our proper perfection without your society. This day have we been destitute of that advantageous assistance. It made us deeply feel our solitude. But the countenance you have maintained to∣wards us, hath been a delicious consolation. It is your faculty, ladies, to indulge a kind and benevolent heart, and to make many happy without the least departure from true dignity. These and a thousand other agreeable qualities, are daily increasing your influence on our hearts.</P>
<P>We trust, respected fathers and mothers of families, that you will not blame us for regarding our once charming companions in our studies. You will readily believe, that their society must be pleasing to us: but your wisdom hath determined, that in some instances, we should be de∣prived of their society; and that they shall not mix the common course of their studies with ours. But without any impeachment of your wisdom, we cannot but rejoice, that there is a way, in which we may attain the permanent blessings of their society, without injury to them; and we humbly hope, without offence to you.</P>
<P>My brethren of the school—we have lived together in the course of this term, in delightful harmony and good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r—most remarkable, considering the number of stu∣dents collected from various towns—and the length of the term. We have been engaged together in the most hon∣orable pursuits. To separate, to leave our favorite studies, and dissolve our favorite society, must be painful to the heart of sensibility: yet we have this comfort, that our so∣ciety is not wholly dissolved—the root of it remains, and
<PB N="523" REF="034600_0512_0FFF3665AE4F02D0"/>
when we please we can make it fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urish again. The insti∣tutions of the school form all the gentlemen and ladies in the town, who have been students, or those who wish to join them into a permanent society, for their improvement in learning, in politeness, and virtue, and all that is com∣mendable. I must now, compelled by the desires of the students, and sufficiently prompted by my own heart, re∣turn the fervent thanks of the school▪ to all the ladies and gentlemen, who have been present, for their polite and consoling countenances, which they have given us this evening. Your looks have shown, as in a mirror, the be∣nevolence of your hearts, and we trust that the respecta∣ble gentlemen, visitors of the school, if we may conjecture from the countenance they have preserved, in their result on our performances, will raise our hearts to the highest pitch of gladness they can at present receive.</P>

<L>When spring delights us, with the voice of love.</L>

<L>MINDS give the only joy which time defies,</L>
<L>Within our souls the source of pleasure lies.</L>

<L>'Tis all in vain, the mental charm away—</L>
<L>We curse the star, which sheds delusive day.</L>
<L>Without the mind, the sense of pleasure flies,</L>
<L>Without the mind, the charm of beauty dies.</L>
<L>But let the soul exert her angel power,</L>
<L>Each scene is lovely, blest is every hour,</L>

<P>THE kind attention with which you have been pleased to hear our performances, excites the most agreeable sensations in our hearts. The countenance of the assem∣bly has given us courage and enabled us to please—praise to the youthful heart attempting worthy deeds is like dew upon the springing grass. If thus you cherish the sensa∣tions of the youthful heart, and fan the rising ardor of vir∣tue—your institutions of learning must prosper even be∣yond your most brilliant expectations.</P>
<P>The giving of this most brilliant part of your exhibit∣ion to a person, not an inhabitant of your town—shows the liberality of your institutions—and the impartiality reigning in the school—the way to be conspicuous in any branch, is open to any one who has a passion for laudable improvement—I would willingly convince you, that the love of learning flourishes in other places, and other towns, as well as yours.
<PB N="529" REF="034600_0518_0FFF366E2A4EF690"/>
Shall I not in my addresses to the several parts of the as∣sembly begin with the most deserving? We must then pay our devoirs to our respectable Matrons here present—Our hearts will will not suffer us to omit this; which is both our duty and pleasure—You have done us the honor to think our performances worthy of your attention—And be assured, in proportion as our minds expand to receive knowledge; they will increase in respect to you—That mind must be stupid which thinks not with gratitude on the painful duties and attentions of a mother—Happy the youth who has one, who delights in his accomplishments— No means will be left unessayed that he may have them in perfection.</P>
<P>Yet while we remember matronal dignity, &amp; recompence with gratitude maternal care, we cannot forget the agree∣able young ladies, who, tho they study not with us, are related to us, in the privileges of the school—You hide our faults from them, that they may respect us; you discipline them not in our presence, lest their delicate minds should not support the mortification—Yet in the assembly of the dance—or harmless evening amusement—you permit us to have their society. Thus from early life you cherish mu∣tual respect and esteem between the sexes—Young as we are, our hearts already begin to bless you.</P>
<P>My heart delights to address you, young Ladies, for who can be insensible to your approbation—Who be indifferent to your beauties and accomplishments—The heart which is cherished by you; must learn the virtues from your con∣duct of life—The mind contemplates your beauties, ad∣mires your graces, and prefers your virtues—Nothing could console us in leaving your animating presence, but the hope of being reunited, with our dearest domestic friends.</P>
<P>My delightful associates, and fellow students—permit my address to you—If the ladies have our love—and we can∣not recal it; our friendship is left for you. We have passed our winter in learning and in pleasure—In pleasure not deserving reprobation—but which every noble mind must approve—The pleasures of learning and of virtue— We would wish such society to last forever—And now shall these hearts pure from the pollution of the world receive the first impressions of vice—No if we be tempted to de∣part
<PB N="530" REF="034600_0519_0FFF36A3DB323438"/>
from truth, from elegance and from virtue—we will think of these amiable beings—these exemplary young la∣dies, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey will recall our minds to all that is worthy the pursuit of human kind—May the heavens smile on these m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nds, who are devoted to the useful arts—Virtue and happiness will establish their rule in this house. We shall always remember with pleasure the days we have passed together—We thank our parents for their attention to our improvement—We thank the Patrons and Instructors of this assembly—We thank the ladies for their politeness, &amp; candor. We thank the Almighty Father both for wisdom and happiness—Our hearts are full of gratitude to Him, that is above us; and to all and every being around us— May the choicest of heaven's blessings, rest on you, respecta∣ble matron —Our venerable fathers, our associates, and friends, forever, may you possess all the happiness, that the mind can imagine, or the heart can desire—and may that happiness be absolutely without end.</P>

<L>Fine speech and simple truth will scarce agree.</L>
<L>Indeed what would, or can, we say; but this,</L>
<L>Your favor is our greatest earthly bliss.</L>
<L>Tho this we've said full many times before,</L>
<L>The more 'tis said, our pleasure is the more,</L>

<L>Or seek for them a life which shall not end.</L>

<HEAD>Conclusion.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author, having completed the plan of his work, would take a decent farewell of his readers. He has en∣deavored to set in a clear light, in his Dialogues, some of the most necessary and useful principles of morality, and religion; and to awaken, and exemplify, those decent and tender affections, which form the felicity of domestic life— these are more level to the comprehension of persons under twenty years of age—than the speeches of generals at the head of armies, or the high wrought satires▪ which find acceptance in old and corrupted courts: and the author supposes they have a better effect on the hearts of young persons of both sexes. And are more suitable to the sim∣plicity of manners generally prevailing in our common∣wealth—He condemns not other men's works however—all may be useful in their place.</P>
<P>The manuscript copy of this wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k, contained about 1,100 pages in quarto, close<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y written, and the book was printed wholly from the manuscript. It may be tho't not strange therefore, that there should be some errata in it—the au∣thor supposes that half the errors arose from his manu∣script. The printer will not then be chargeable, with any great number. The following he thinks ought to be no∣ticed because they confound the sense of the passages in which they are found.</P>

<P>The Author readers his most sincere thanks to the en∣couragers and patrons of his work. Several Towns in the country, have each subscribed for more than an hundred copies—Perhaps never was a more respectable subscription. But it is not in the Author's power to give a list of the Subscribers; for not one half of the Papers are returned. If the work lives to another edition, the Author will treat all his encouragers with due honors; and will publish a correct list of the Subscribers. But if the work must die in the infancy of its existence, the Subscribers may think it best, that their names were not annexed to it. The type is smaller than the Author at first intended—but on that account the book contains more matter; which, in a book of this kind, is an advantage—A larger type with the same materials must have made a book out of all proportion for a duodecimo—and the Author could not have afforded it at the assigned price. Wishing his Patrons, and his Read∣ers, all happiness in this, and the better life—he remains their sincere friend and</P>
