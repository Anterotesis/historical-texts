The Reasons here<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> follow.</P>
<P N="1">1. Because these Words are used in Scripture not to express God's absolut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Eternity, such as 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 6.16. but even in relation to us his Decree is but (<HI>Gr.) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tωn Aiωnωn,</HI> Eph. 3.11. that is, of the Ages, and not eternal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></P>
<P N="2">2. Because as here the Predetermination of the Ages is made in Christ so (no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>Cosms</HI> or <HI>Worlds,</HI>) but <HI>Aiωnes,</HI> or <HI>the Ages</HI> are made by Christ, <HI>Heb.</HI> 1.2. an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as these Texts are of Ages past, or <HI>a parte ante,</HI> so is also <HI>Col.</HI> 1.26. where <HI>Aiωn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> also thus signifies, and is englished, the Ages.</P>
<P N="3">3. Because <HI>Aiωnios</HI> also being made an Epithite to <HI>Chronos</HI> plurally, <HI>Rom.</HI> 16.2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.9. <HI>Tit.</HI> 1.2. is yet more evidently made not to signify, <HI>a parte ante,</HI> an other than what is temporal, for so it is also used with a Greek <HI>pro,</HI> i. e. <HI>before.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4.

<P N="5">5.

<P N="6">6.

<P>And thus it may be herewith also farther supposed that Christ did actually feel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> undergo, for all fallen Mankind, all that Death, all those Deaths in the several <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of them, which were threatned against Sin and Sinners, even the whole <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> full Wrath of God due to Sin, even the very Torments, as some apprehend,
<PB N="5" REF="039269_0005_1013FA591E0852F0"/>
of Hell; or else, that however his Soul was sorrowful unto Death, wherein h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> might and did undergoe the sorrows of Death and Hell, as <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.17. &amp; 3.15. with <HI>Psal.</HI> 18.5, 6. <HI>Mat.</HI> 26.38. <HI>Mark</HI> 14.34. <HI>Luke</HI> 22.44. <HI>Act.</HI> 2.31. <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.10, 13. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.22. 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 22.5, 6. and <HI>Psal.</HI> 19.4, 5.</P>
<P>Neither is the Everlastingness of the Torments to be suffered in <HI>Hell,</HI> as some suppose, or in the Lake of Fire, any part of the Penalty threatned by way of Sa∣tisfaction to infinite Justice. For so, God's infinite Justice could never be fully sa∣tisfied, no not by the endless Torments of the Damned, if they were to be endless▪ for more and more Justice would still call for further Satisfaction, which meer Man can never fully satisfy, by all his Sufferings; but rather, that full Satisfaction was an Effect of somewhat annext to infinite Justice, the Punishment it self in the whole of it, being not endurable by any meer guilty Creature; and thus the long-lastingness of the Torment in <HI>Hell</HI> hath no place, where that which is full Punishment for Sin, is actually born, and fully satisfied, as that was which was performed in and by Christ, so that henceforth on this account no Man therefore was or now is, or shall be tormented in <HI>Hell,</HI> for want of a Re∣medy, but only for rejecting the one only Remedy, <HI>Heb.</HI> 2.3. Such things which may be well proved and cleared by Scripture, may help to a right Determination in the Case. For Christ's Kingdom is that which is age-wise, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.11. and yet not of this World, <HI>John</HI> 18.36. and must at last have an end, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.24. and yet then first bring forth Judgment unto Victo∣ry, in the moment when that which is perfect shall come, <HI>Matth.</HI> 12.20. with 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.10. after all its encrease, <HI>Isa.</HI> 9.7. that corruption shall thus in a moment, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t last, put on incorruption, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.51, 52, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the Triumph be then ac∣cordingly, <HI>ver.</HI> 54, 55, 56. with <HI>ver.</HI> 57. and thus shall Christ reign, till he make all his Enemies his Foot-stool, <HI>ver.</HI> 24, 26. he exercising, doing, or executing all his victorious Judgment, <HI>John</HI> 5.22, 27. in humane nature, and to the especial ho∣nour of his Saints in this World, <HI>Psal.</HI> 149. last; that when God's Judgments shall be thus in the Earth, the Inhabitants (not of the Earth only, but) of the World may learn Righteousness, <HI>Isa.</HI> 26.9. and thus Christ be glorified and admi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed in his most believing Saints, 2 <HI>Thess.</HI> 1.10. to the benefit of all Crea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ures every where, as <HI>Rev.</HI> 5.10, 14.</P>

<P><HI>Arg.</HI> 5.

<P><HI>Arg.</HI> 6. I argue it from the New Covenant, about the New Creation that is to be established, thorow and by means of, and upon the taking away of the first old Covenant, <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.31, &amp;c. <HI>Heb.</HI> 8.8, &amp;c. <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.9. and that unto the making, not only of a new Heaven and Ear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h according to Promise, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.13. <HI>Rev.</HI> 21.1. but to the making of all Things new, <HI>v.</HI> 5. So that God causing so great a shaking, as well in Heaven as in Earth, most remarkably: Why is there so great a shaking, [thereby to remove that which is shaken] but in order to establish that which can∣not be shaken, that that may remain in the room and stead of that, which being shaken, is to give place, and to be no more, and all this for encouragement to serve God acceptably and aright, <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.26, 27, 28, 29. And therefore it is all spo∣ken of, as assuredly as if already done, how that with respect had to the New Creature in Christ, all old Things are done away, and all Things become New, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.17, 18.</P>
<P>Therefore if the first old decayed World, and this corrupt Creation-state of things shall be but near an hundred such Generations, as <HI>Psal.</HI> 90. <HI>v.</HI> 10. or accord∣ing to the seven days of its Creation-week, <HI>Gen.</HI> 1<HI>st,</HI> 2<HI>d,</HI> 3<HI>d,</HI> Chapters, with 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 5.8.

For did not <HI>Methuselah,</HI> in a World destroyed, live near a thou∣sand Years? which may have something of Type in it, there being to be a Season, wherein a hundred Years shall be but an Infants Age, <HI>Isa.</HI> 65.20. And at the latter end of this World, when the Beast and False Prophet shall suffer, shall not the suffering Saints reign then a thousand Years, <HI>Rev.</HI> 19. lat. with <HI>Rev.</HI> 20.4? And is not all this something to intimate, that Christ's Age-wise special Kingdom, in Type and Antitype both, shall be more than a thousand thousand Years? And in all this time, and at the end of it, such as at the last Change, shall not Judgment, for and in the behalf of Incorruption, be indeed victorious: as 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.51, &amp;c. with <HI>Matth.</HI> 12.20. that there may be a deliverance out of the hands of all Enemies, <HI>Luke</HI> 1.74. and there be then also no more curse, <HI>Rev.</HI> 22.3. but Sin it self, or Sins be made an end of, <HI>Dan.</HI> 9.24. and so the very inferior Creature also be no more made Subject to the vanity which it is at present groaning under, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.21, 22?</P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> 7. Lastly, I argue it from the final destruction of Death, the Gulph, Hell it self, and the very Abyss or Deep, which is become the special place of the great Leviathan, spoken of as the Dragon in the Sea. For what though gradual Death was threatned, <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.17. (<HI>Heb.</HI>) yet this shall not pre∣vent Death, the last Enemy, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.26. but this second Death at last, after all the time of the first Death and <HI>Hell,</HI> before the last Judgment unaccomplished and unfixt, shall become Death to the very last change of all Creatures, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.51. with <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.21. even till then a Death of Deaths, a Hell-death, the Death of Hell, made up of the two special Ingredients; the one Ingredient of and from that of the former first Death, and of and from the other this of <HI>Hell,</HI> as it was before unfixed, as if then formerly it had been in the Air, and Sea, or Abysse, ra∣ther than in <HI>Gehenna,</HI> or the Lake of Fire and Brimstone on Earth, in that which is in respect of the Holy City and its Appurtenances, called the <HI>without,</HI> Rev. 22.15. And how is this place of outward and utter darkness decyphered or deno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, in its Type or Antitype, as before, but as 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.26. <HI>Rev.</HI> 1.18, &amp; 2.11. &amp; 20.1, 10, 14. &amp; 12.8. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 28.10. &amp; 32.21.24 — 32. &amp; 18.23. &amp; 33.11. with 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.16, 17. and the like.</P>
<P>But yet shall it not however be a Death, as great and long a Death and as long as it is, and shall endure, that shall be final and destroyed? And therefore shall there not be a season when the Sea it self shall be no more, and that as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. 1 end, as an earnest of a full issue, to what results from thence, which is therefore the more considerable, according to <HI>Isa.</HI> 27.1, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with the end of the former Chap∣ter, and with <HI>Isa.</HI> 57.20, 21. and so with <HI>Rev.</HI> 13.1. &amp; 11.7. &amp; 17.8. &amp; 20.1, 3. &amp; 9.1, 2, 11. <HI>Luke</HI> 8.31. <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.7. <HI>Deut.</HI> 30.12. and the like.

For who would not conceive the Soul here in this of the <HI>Psalmist,</HI> to be distinct from the Flesh, in the former verse; and if then the Flesh may be understood of the Body in the Grave, where bodily corruption is usually suffered, how can the Soul be understood but of the incor∣ruptible part of Christ's Humanity, even of his inward man elsewhere? For, did not his Soul continue elsewhere separate from his Body all the time his Flesh or Body was in the Grave? Surely his Flesh, or Body and Soul, may not both of them be thought to have their being and abode, after his Death till his Resurrection, in the same place, till the very hour of his Resurrection, or the third day. But this will ap∣pear more evidently from the following 56th verse, where Sin, as the cause mostly and principally of <HI>Hell's</HI> Victory, is therefore most directly triumphed against, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat as to its Sting, which is not without torment, whereas the Flesh or Body hath no torment at all, or sensible suffering in the Grave. Nay, there also in that same verse, the Law it self, that of Nature, and of the first Covenant broken, yea and of both Covenants not continued in, or of what ever is Law, and is transgressed, and become any way the strength of Sin, is here explicated, and that also under this head of Triumph, which is the Triumph that is here made against all the greatest and most powerful Enemies of the Creature, and therefore against <HI>Hell it self,</HI> as an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nemy, that all will confess doth last longer than the first Death, and also than the Grave; and that is that which doth take in all Deads, otherwise than the Grave <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oth.
