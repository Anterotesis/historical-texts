<HEAD>ELEGY, On the DEATH of MR. BUCKINGHAM ST. JOHN, TUTOR of YALE COLLEGE, who was drowned in his Passage from <HI>New-Haven</HI> to <HI>Norwalk,</HI>
<DATE><HI>May</HI> the 5th, 1771.</DATE></HEAD>
<L>THE world now yields to night's returning sway;</L>
<L>The deeper glooms lead on the solemn hour,</L>
<L>And call my steps, beneath the moon's pale ray,</L>
<L>To roam in sadness on the sea-beat shore.</L>
<L>Now glide the unconstant shadows o'er the plain,</L>
<L>The broad moon swimming thro' the broken clouds,</L>
<L>The gleam of waters brightens on the main,</L>
<L>And anchor'd navies lift their waving shrouds.</L>
<L>Deep silence reigns, save on the moory ground,</L>
<L>The long reed rustling to the passing gales,</L>
<L>The noise of dashing waves, and hollow sound</L>
<L>Of rushing winds that murmur thro' the sails.</L>
<L>Far hence, ye pleasures of a mind at ease,</L>
<L>The sprightly joys that rural scenes can yield,</L>
<L>When spring, led jocund by the soft'ning breeze</L>
<L>Wakes the glad morn and robes the dewy field.</L>
<L>Far be the giddy raptures of the gay,</L>
<L>The midnight joys licentious youth can share,</L>
<L>While Ruin, smiling o'er her destin'd prey,</L>
<L>In sweet allurements hides her deadly snare.</L>
<L>Mine be the music of the rolling wave,</L>
<L>The moonlight shadows and surrounding gloom,</L>
<L>Mine the dread haunts of Contemplation grave,</L>
<L>That lift the soul to scenes beyond the tomb.</L>
<L>Here while deep midnight hold her silent reign,</L>
<L>And fancy bears the ravish'd thought along,</L>
<L>Dark Melancholy spreads her airy train,</L>
<L>And Friendship calls and Grief inspires the song.</L>
<L>As thro' these mournful glooms I stretch my sight,</L>
<L>Mid sounds of death that bid the soul attend,</L>
<L>Mid empty forms and fleeting shapes of night,</L>
<L>Slowly I view a whiterobed shade ascend.</L>
<L>That says, "I once was St. John! from the bounds</L>
<L>Of unknown realms beneath the dreary wave,</L>
<L>Where ever-restless floods in nightly rounds,</L>
<L>Roll their dark surges o'er my watry grave.</L>
<L>From seats which, near to mortal sight display'd,</L>
<L>The gates of vast eternity surround,</L>
<L>In night conceal'd and death's impervious shade,</L>
<L>My voice ascends! attend the warning sound.</L>
<L>Oh, thou attend! who flush'd with early bloom,</L>
<L>In life's new spring and vernal sweetness gay,</L>
<L>Mindless of fate, that must thy branch entomb,</L>
<L>Spread'st thy green blossoms to the morning ray.</L>
<L>With thee how late, how like alas, to thee,</L>
<L>To mortal joys by opening youth beguil'd,</L>
<L>I stretch'd my airy wish, and follow'd free,</L>
<L>Where pleasure triumph'd and where fancy smil'd.</L>
<L>Then while fond Hope her glitt'ring pinions spread,</L>
<L>Pointing to climes beyond the distant wave,</L>
<L>Ev'n then unnoticed o'er my destined head</L>
<L>Hung Death's dire form and seal'd me for the grave.</L>
<L>How vain the thought for many a joyous morn,</L>
<L>To taste of raptures unallay'd by woe!</L>
<L>At once from life and every pleasure torn,</L>
<L>From all I wish'd and all I loved below.</L>
<L>The faithless morning, on our opening sails,</L>
<L>Smiled out serene and smooth'd our gliding way,</L>
<L>While the gay vessel, fann'd by breathing gales,</L>
<L>Play'd on the placid bosom of the sea.</L>
<L>When lo, descending on the dark'ning wind,</L>
<L>Burst the dire storm—and feeble to sustain</L>
<L>The rushing blasts in warring fury join'd,</L>
<L>The frail skiff sinks beneath the surging main.</L>
<L>And see, afar the oarless boat conveys</L>
<L>The trembling sailors to the distant shore;</L>
<L>Alone, of aid bereft, with one last gaze,</L>
<L>I sunk in deeps and sunk to rise no more.</L>
<L>In that sad hour, what fearful scenes arise,</L>
<L>What pangs distress, what unknown fears dismay,</L>
<L>When future worlds disclosing on our eyes,</L>
<L>The trembling soul forsakes her kindred clay!</L>
<L>Before the awful bar, th' almighty throne,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> read, I've stood th' Eternal Judge to see,</L>
<L>And fix'd in bliss, or doom'd to endless moan,</L>
<L>Have heard the long, the unrevers'd decree:</L>
<L>Nor earth must know the rest"—Where art thou now,</L>
<L>In youthful joys my partner and my friend,</L>
<L>Of those blest hours thy fortune gave below,</L>
<L>Of all our hopes is this the fatal end?</L>
<L>Oh what avail'd that energy of mind,</L>
<L>For distant realms of science to explore,</L>
<L>That early led where Genius unconfin'd</L>
<L>Spreads her glad feast and opes her clasic store?</L>
<L>Ah what avail'd, mid earthly hopes so frail,</L>
<L>The same gay-dawning on thy rising years?</L>
<L>Ah what avail'd (for what could then avail?)</L>
<L>Thy friend's deep sorrow, or thy country's tears?</L>
<L>In pleasure's paths, where vivid fancy led,</L>
<L>Mid ev'ry hope that blooming worth could raise,</L>
<L>The wings of death, with fatal horror spread,</L>
<L>Blank'd the bright promise of thy future days.</L>
<L>So from the lowring west the darkened clouds</L>
<L>Rush on the sun and dim his orient ray,</L>
<L>And hateful night in glooms untimely shrouds</L>
<L>Th' ascending glories of the vernal day.</L>
<L>Adieu, my friend, so dear in vain, adieu,</L>
<L>Till some short days their fleeting courses roll,</L>
<L>Soon shall our steps thine earlier fate pursue,</L>
<L>Moved in the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ace and crowding to the goal.</L>
<L>Th' approaching hour shall see the sun no more</L>
<L>Wheel his long course, or spread his golden ray;</L>
<L>Soon shall the dream of mortal life be o'er,</L>
<L>The brightness dawning of celestial day.</L>
<L>Then join'd in bliss, as once in friendship join'd,</L>
<L>May pitying heav'n our purer spirits raise,</L>
<L>Each crime atoned, each virtue well refined,</L>
<L>To pass a blest eternity of praise.</L>
