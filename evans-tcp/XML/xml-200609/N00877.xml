<HEAD>THE LOYAL ADDRESS OF THE Clergy of Virginia.</HEAD>
<L>MAY it please you dread Sir, we the Clerks of <HI>Virginia,</HI></L>
<L>Who pray for Tobacco, and Preach for a Guinea,</L>
<L>Patroon'd to Contempt, and by favour made Elves,</L>
<L>For Troopers are Listed and pay Tythes to our Selves.</L>
<L>The meanest Brigade of Your Majesties <HI>Grubstreets,</HI></L>
<L>Tho' Late; not least Loyal of Your Clerical Subjects,</L>
<L>Among Crouds of <HI>True Hearts</HI> that of late do Address You,</L>
<L>In our humble Phrase do Crave Leave to Carress You</L>
<L>To shew for Your Safety how with Zeal we burn all,</L>
<L>Under the Reverend <HI>James Blare</HI> our Collonel.</L>
<L>And here we cann't choose but proclaim our Resentment,</L>
<L>That we mar'l what the Devil the Politick <HI>French</HI> meant:</L>
<L>In Affront to Your Person, and the Throne that You sit on,</L>
<L>To Dub the Young <HI>Bricklair</HI> the King of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></L>
<L>Tho' we are not with some so high pufft with the Ptysick,</L>
<L>As to say 'tis a Breach of the Treaty of <HI>Reswick</HI>;</L>
<L>Yet we boldly averr, and by Words do assure it</L>
<L>To be such a Contempt, we can never indure it:</L>
<L>Wherefore if Your Foes do persist for to slight You,</L>
<L>We will all of us Pray, nay and some of us Fight too:</L>
<L>For like <HI>Hogans</HI> half drunk, Your Polemicks I fancy</L>
<L>Can Club prety well when Inspir'd with <HI>Nantsy,</HI></L>
<L>Among all the Black Guard You Cann't miss of an Hector,</L>
<L>Unless You chance light on the <HI>Williamburg</HI> Rector:</L>
<L>Yet we'll favour the <HI>French</HI> if we find they'l be Civil,</L>
<L>For be it known that we fear 'em no more than the Devil:</L>
<L>However we chan huff it, if they never come near us,</L>
<L>If they should I am afraid they would damnably scare us▪</L>
<L>Then to save our own Skins, and to silence Gainsaiers,</L>
<L>We'll leave of our bouncing and fall to our Prayers.</L>
<L>May kind Heavens preserve long Your Majesties good Soul,</L>
<L>And bring <HI>Lewis</HI> to beg a loath'd life at Your Footstool:</L>
<L>May <HI>Mantanoon</HI> Pox his Black Soul to the Devil,</L>
<L>And <HI>Burgundy</HI> Rot with his putred Kings Evil:</L>
<L>May young D' <HI>Anjoy</HI> be trust at the arm of the Main-yard,</L>
<L>And <HI>Austria</HI> possess the Command of the <HI>Spaniard:</HI></L>
<L>May all Factious Distinctions henceforth be forgotten,</L>
<L>Nor Your Spiritual Pedlers be Contrould by a <HI>Scotch</HI> one:</L>
<L>May your Health in your College go Loyally Round,</L>
<L>And all your Leige People have Twelve-pence a Pound.</L>
