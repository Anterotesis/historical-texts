<HEAD>A NEW Proclamation!</HEAD>
<L>By THOMAS GAGE, whom British frenzy,</L>
<L>Stil'd honourable and Excellency,</L>
<L>O'er Massachusett's sent to stand here</L>
<L>Vice Admiral and Chief Commander;</L>
<L>Whose power Gubernatorial still</L>
<L>Extends as far as Bunker's-Hill,</L>
<L>Whose Admiralty reaches clever,</L>
<L>Full half a mile up Mistic river,</L>
<L>Let ev'ry clime and ev'ry nation</L>
<L>Attend once more—A PROCLAMATION.</L>
<L>WHEREAS th' infatuated creatures,</L>
<L>Still led by folks whom we call traitors,</L>
<L>(Whom had we dar'd, we'd have you know,</L>
<L>We should have hang'd a year ago)</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="014526_0002_0F92FD467212F458"/>Advancing in progression fatal</L>
<L>Have now proceeded to give battle,</L>
<L>And with deep wounds, that fate portend,</L>
<L>Gall'd many a Reg'lars <HI>latter</HI> end;</L>
<L>And all the good effects we hop'd,</L>
<L>From fear and patience now are drop'd,</L>
<L>The good effects we mean, of gaining,</L>
<L>Whate'er you had was worth obtaining,</L>
<L>The good effects we saw in visions,</L>
<L>Of Lordships, Pensions, Posts, Commissions,</L>
<L>All which by following these same elves,</L>
<L>You've kept most wisely for yourselves;</L>
<L>It but remains for us, who stand</L>
<L>Invested with supreme command,</L>
<L>To prove we do not bear, or show you</L>
<L>The sword in vain—So woe be to you!</L>
<L>But first 'tis fit it should be seen,</L>
<L>What arrant knaves ye all have been</L>
<L>What dreadful crimes you've been committing,</L>
<L>'Gainst parliament and crown of Britain,</L>
<L>Denied their sacred rights to these,</L>
<L>Of calmly robbing whom they please,</L>
<L>And trait'rously combin'd your forces</L>
<L>To save your consciences and purses;</L>
<L>That any man with half an eye</L>
<L>Your plots and mischiefs might espy,</L>
<L>And by the pains you took to hide 'em,</L>
<L>Discern your knav'ries e'er you tried 'em,</L>
<L>Did ye not fright each public press,</L>
<L>And make e'en RIVINGTON confess,</L>
<L>Scare ev'ry Printer bold and wise,</L>
<L>Who dar'd to publish Tory lies?</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="014526_0003_0F92FD472CC9DDB8"/>Nay, when myself in Proclamation,</L>
<L>Spread wholesome falshoods through the nation,</L>
<L>Altho' the lies I used to scatter,</L>
<L>Were of the noblest size, no matter;</L>
<L>Did ye not all refuse to credit,</L>
<L>As if some common lyar had said it?</L>
<L>Did not my scribbler general strain hard,</L>
<L>My Massachusettensis, L—d,</L>
<L>Write every moment he could spare</L>
<L>From cards, and barbers, and the fair,</L>
<L>To argue, wheedle, coax and frighten</L>
<L>Your hardy rogues from schemes of fighting,</L>
<L>Scrawl'd, till he muddled quite his head;</L>
<L>And did you mind one word he said?</L>
<L>Did not my grave Judge S—l hit,</L>
<L>The summit of news-paper wit,</L>
<L>Fill every leaf, and every paper,</L>
<L>Of MILLS and HICKS, and Mother DRAPER,</L>
<L>Draw proclamations, works of toil,</L>
<L>In true sublime of scare-crow style.</L>
<L>Write farces too 'gainst right and freedom,</L>
<L>All for your good—and none would read 'em,</L>
<L>My friends at York did ye not hamper,</L>
<L>And make each Tory scribbler scamper,</L>
<L>From COOPER, that right reverend Ribald;</L>
<L>By Phebus' self, inspir'd to quibble,</L>
<L>Down to th' unmeaning, senseless prater,</L>
<L>From folly's rear guard, stiled MERCATOR;</L>
<L>Raise such a tumult, bluster, jarring,</L>
<L>That midst the clash of tempests warring,</L>
<L>L—w's weathercock, with veers forlorn,</L>
<L>Could hardly tell which way to turn?</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="014526_0004_0F92FC011CF44310"/>And did ye not in the same shallow way,</L>
<L>Fright my poor Pennsylvanian G—y?</L>
<L>What ropes and halters did ye send</L>
<L>To mind him of his latter end?</L>
<L>Till least he'd hang in more than effigy,</L>
<L>Fled in a fog the trembling refugee?</L>
<L>What disappointments sad, and bilkings,</L>
<L>Awaited poor departing WILKINS?</L>
<L>What wild confusion, rout and hobble, you▪</L>
<L>Made with the Farmer, Don A. W.</L>
<L>How did you 'fore committees drag it,</L>
<L>And answer it with fire and faggot?</L>
<L>Still bent your own side to advance,</L>
<L>You never gave us equal chance,</L>
<L>That all the world might see and tell,</L>
<L>Which party beat at <HI>lying well.</HI></L>
<L>From whence the point is very clear,</L>
<L>You did not dare the truth to hear;</L>
<L>But fearful lest the world should guess it,</L>
<L>Took all this trouble to suppress it.</L>
<L>Did ye not prate of law and right,</L>
<L>And stir your Yankies up to fight,</L>
<L>Apply the animating lays</L>
<L>Of freedom's sons in antient days,</L>
<L>Altho you could not fail to know</L>
<L>Those days were thousand years ago?</L>
<L>Did not your clergy, all as one,</L>
<L>Vile Protestants each mother's son,</L>
<L>Tho' miracles have left in lurch,</L>
<L>All men, but our true Cath'lic church,</L>
<L>Engage your knaves in treasons stout,</L>
<L>And tell them heav'n would help you out,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="014526_0005_0F92FBFF6A2A1140"/>That providence subscrib'd the league,</L>
<L>And angels carried, on th' intrigue,</L>
<L>Till proud such aid was on your side,</L>
<L>You all our mortal pow'r defied;</L>
<L>While every sermon beat alarms,</L>
<L>And ev'ry pulpit beat to arms?</L>
<L>And now to tell the things that past,</L>
<L>The nineteenth day of April last▪</L>
<L>Of your arm'd men, some twenty dozens,</L>
<L>Whom our fears multiplied to thousands,</L>
<L>(For fear supplies in ways right able</L>
<L>The whole of old Pythog'ras' table;)</L>
<L>Attack'd the peaceful troops I sent,</L>
<L>For plunder, not for slaughter meant;</L>
<L>Who little mischief then had done,</L>
<L>But kill'd eight men at Lexington;</L>
<L>This shew'd their love to peace and virtue,</L>
<L>And prov'd they'd no intent to hurt you;</L>
<L>For did not ev'ry Reg'lar run,</L>
<L>As soon as e'er you fired a gun?</L>
<L>And fearful if they staid for sport,</L>
<L>You might by accident be hurt,</L>
<L>Convey themselves with speed away,</L>
<L>Full twenty miles in half a day;</L>
<L>Run till their legs were grown so weary,</L>
<L>They scarce suffic'd their weight to carry?</L>
<L>While you unmov'd by all this kindness,</L>
<L>Pursu'd, like tygers, still behind us;</L>
<L>And since assuming airs so tall</L>
<L>Because we did not kill you all,</L>
<L>You've dared with jibes and jeers confounded,</L>
<L>T' insult the brave, whose backs ye wounded;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="014526_0006_0F92FD4852D54DE8"/>(Tho' valour would with shame have burn'd.</L>
<L>To shoot at men whose backs were turned)</L>
<L>And bragging <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igh, as though you beat us,</L>
<L>No more mind Reg'lars than musquitoes,</L>
<L>Fire on us at your will, and shut</L>
<L>The town, as tho' ye'd starve us out,</L>
<L>And with parade prepost'rous hedg'd,</L>
<L>Affect to hold us here besieg'd;</L>
<L>Tho' we who still command the seas,</L>
<L>Can run away when e'er we please,</L>
<L>Scare all the Tories into town,</L>
<L>And burn their hay and houses down,</L>
<L>And threaten high unless we flee,</L>
<L>To drive us headlong in the sea;</L>
<L>As once to faithless Jews a sign,</L>
<L>The De'el turn'd Hogreeve, did the swine▪</L>
<L>At any rate, I'm now content to</L>
<L>Avoid the scrape I have got into,</L>
<L>And publish'd here my resolution</L>
<L>Of blood to spare the least effusion:</L>
<L>For fast proceeding in this pickle,</L>
<L>Who knows whose blood the next may trickle,</L>
<L>'Tis time in faith to cry enough;</L>
<L>Heav'n prosper those who now leave off.</L>
<L>Those that in peace will henceforth live,</L>
<L>I, and his Majesty forgive.</L>
<L>No more the Yankies I contemn;</L>
<L>Let me alone, and I'll let them,</L>
<L>All but that arch rogue, and first grand cock,</L>
<L>Your <HI>Samuel Adams</HI> and <HI>John Hancock,</HI></L>
<L>Whose crimes are grown to that degree,</L>
<L>I must hang them, or they'll hang me.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="014526_0007_0F92FD48A2207EF8"/>But farther to explain to th' end,</L>
<L>That none may ignorance pretend,</L>
<L>I, <HI>ex cathedra,</HI> each mal-feazance</L>
<L>That follows rank with blackest treasons,</L>
<L>Whoe'er shall henceforth, without more said,</L>
<L>Associate with those knaves aforesaid,</L>
<L>Take arms to fight, or to conceal</L>
<L>Such Traitors 'gainst the common weal,</L>
<L>Aid them with money, arms, provision,</L>
<L>Goods, carriages, or ammunition,</L>
<L>Assist their onset, or retreat,</L>
<L>And help them, or to fight, or eat,</L>
<L>Hold correspondence, us to weaken,</L>
<L>By letter, message, sign or beacon;</L>
<L>Know they, as traitors we shall watch 'em,</L>
<L>And hang they shall, if I can catch 'em.</L>
<L>And now (for bravely we come on,</L>
<L>One more <HI>Whereas,</HI> and then we've done)</L>
<L>WHEREAS as long as we shall dwell on</L>
<L>This strange, <HI>unnatural rebellion,</HI></L>
<L>For all rebellion, to a notch</L>
<L>Is nat'ral, only to the Scotch,</L>
<L>Tho' parliament have done their share,</L>
<L>To nat'ralize it ev'ry where)</L>
<L>Since justice cannot take its course,</L>
<L>And common law's kick'd out of doors;</L>
<L>I by the pow'r your charters grant,</L>
<L>(Find ye out how, for faith, I can't)</L>
<L>Prescribe, to keep all rogues in awe,</L>
<L>The constant use of Martial Law,</L>
<L>So long and in such quantities,</L>
<L>As my great wisdom shall devise;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="014526_0008_0F92FD49627401E0"/>Then without noise, or grumbling take it,</L>
<L>And ropes shall trick the knaves who break it.</L>
<L>But putting off this rage and fury,</L>
<L>I'm twice as glad again, t'assure you,</L>
<L>That all who in this trying crisis,</L>
<L>Shall heed my peaceable advices,</L>
<L>Submit to me in ev'ry thing,</L>
<L>And lose their rights to please the King,</L>
<L>Shall from my arm, which is not short,</L>
<L>Obtain protection and support;</L>
<L>Such as I give the Boston Tories</L>
<L>Who starve for heeding thus my stories,</L>
<L>Or venture each his worthless head,</L>
<L>Condemn'd to list, and fight for bread.</L>
<L>And all the Tory refugees</L>
<L>May now go home whene'er they please;</L>
<L>We've no occasion for such stuff;</L>
<L>We've British fools and knaves enough.</L>
<L>Whene'er they dare without remissness,</L>
<L>Let them walk out about their business;</L>
<L>Yet not with Whigs and Rebels link't,</L>
<L>But still stand sep'rate and distinct,</L>
<L>Till mercy aid your country undone,</L>
<L>And heav'n dispatch me back to LONDON</L>
