<HEAD>EDITORS PREFACE TO THE AMERICAN EDITION, WITH PLATES.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Poem was first publish∣ed in 1782, in the state of Connecticut, where the Author was born, and received his education, and where he now resides. It has passed through several impressions in this country, and Great-Britain, and has obtained universal celebrity.</P>
<P>In 1792 a splendid edition of it appear∣ed in London, with explanatory notes. So far as these notes contain facts, and serve to elucidate passages, which would be otherwise obscure, they are <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="iv" REF="029659_0004_0FE212A7810CFB60"/>
in this edition: But as that London edi∣tion was published to answer the purposes of a party, and the Editor has taken the liberty to misrepresent the views of the Author, the preface and such of the notes as were inserted for that purpose, are here omitted. This is done at the re∣quest of the author, with whose permissi∣on, this edition is offered to the Ameri∣can public.</P>
<P>The design of the Poem will best ap∣pear from its general tenor. The Au∣thor, at the time the opposition of Ame∣rica to the unjust claims of the British Parliament, was maturing into system, liv∣ed in Boston with one of the principal projectors of American Independence. He espoused the cause of his country, and became intimately acquainted with the transactions of the early revolutionists, and all the measures of the British agents, to counter-act the opposition. This appears by a number of Anecdotes, very humor∣ously related, in the course of the Poem.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="029659_0005_0FE212A9E7BA93F8"/>That the Author is a warm friend of American Independence, is obvious, from the whole tenor of the work; and the principal scope of the Poem seems to have been, to ridicule the claims of the Bri∣tish Parliament, and the measures pursued to enforce those claims. At the same time, the absurdities and misconduct of his own countrymen have not escaped his no∣tice.</P>
<P>The Author is no friend to monarchy, nor aristocracy; nor is he a raving de∣mocrat. He is a friend of republican go∣vernment, and rational liberty—that liber∣ty which is secured by just laws, and a steady administration of justice. But it is not true that the Poem was written with the sole view to ridicule any particular form of government.</P>
<P>The scene of the Poem is laid in Massa∣chusetts, where the Revolution originated. The time is in 1775. M'FINGAL the hero, is designed to represent the tory fac∣tion
<PB N="vi" REF="029659_0006_0FE212AC5156FED0"/>
in general: and HONORIUS, the whigs.</P>
<P>It is unnecessary to say any thing of the merit of the Poem. This is universally acknowledged; and the Poem will conti∣nue to be read and admired, while true taste and science adorn the civilized world. The Philosopher in his closet, the travel∣ler on his voyage, and the man of busi∣ness at his fire-side, will always find M'FINGAL, an instructive friend, and a pleasant companion.</P>
<P>The Editors have taken particular pains, to render this edition, worthy of public patronage. The explanatory notes will give this impression a great advantage over any American edition. Indeed with∣out them, many passages alluding to lo∣cal customs, or descriptive of local transac∣tions, could not be understood by a great proportion of readers.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Plates</HI> added to this edition, are an improvement on all former ones,
<PB N="vii" REF="029659_0007_0FE212AFF0FE30C8"/>
and cannot sail to give it a decided pre∣ference.</P>
<P>In every respect the Editors flatter them∣selves, the elegance of the work will do justice to this admired Poem; and they confide in the liberality of their country∣men, to give due encouragement to this specimen of American genius and industry.</P>
<P>THE Notes in this Edition marked with in∣verted Commas, were inserted by the Author in the first Edition; those that are not so marked, are principally extracted and altered from a London Edition, Printed in the Year 1792.</P>

<L>From Boston, in his best array,</L>
<L>Great 'Squire, M'Fingal, took his way,</L>

<L>Which great M'Pherson, with submission,</L>

<L>His fathers flourish'd in the Highlands</L>
<L>Of Scotia's fog-benighted islands;</L>
<L>Whence gain'd our 'Squire two gifts by right,</L>
<L>Rebellion and the Second-sight.</L>
<L>Of these the first, in ancient days,</L>
<L>Had gain'd the noblest palms of praise,</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="029659_0010_0FE212B787AD2620"/>'Gainst Kings stood forth, and many a crown'd head</L>
<L>With terror <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> its might confounded;</L>
<L>Till rose a King with potent charm</L>
<L>His foes by goodness to disarm;</L>
<L>Whom ev'ry Scot and Jacobite</L>
<L>Strait fell in love with—at first sight;</L>
<L>Whose gracious speech, with aid of pensions,</L>
<L>Hush'd down all murmers of dissentions,</L>
<L>And with the sound of potent metal,</L>
<L>Brought all their blust'ring swarms to settle;</L>
<L>Who rain'd his ministerial mannas,</L>
<L>Till loud Sedition sung Hosannas;</L>
<L>The good Lords-Bishops and the Kirk</L>
<L>United in the public-work;</L>
<L>Rebellion from the northern regions,</L>
<L>With Bute and Mansfield swore allegiance,</L>
<L>And all combin'd to raze as nuisance,</L>
<L>Of church and state, the constitutions;</L>
<L>Pull down the empire on whose ruins</L>
<L>They meant to edify their new ones;</L>
<L>Enslave the Amer'can wildernesses,</L>
<L>And tear the provinces in pieces.</L>
<L>For these our 'Squire, among the valant'st,</L>
<L>Employ'd his time and tools and talents;</L>
<L>And in their cause, with manly zeal,</L>
<L>Us'd his first virtue to rebel;</L>
<L>And sound this new rebellion pleasing</L>
<L>As his old king destroying treason.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="029659_0011_0FE212BE49511220"/>Nor less avail'd his optic sleight,</L>
<L>And Scotish gift of second-sight.</L>
<L>No ancient sybil, fam'd in rhyme,</L>
<L>Saw deeper in the womb of time;</L>
<L>No block in old Dodona's grove,</L>
<L>Could ever more orac'lar prove.</L>
<L>Nor only saw he all that was,</L>
<L>But much that never came to pass;</L>
<L>Whereby all Prophets far out-went he,</L>
<L>Tho' former days produc'd a plenty:</L>
<L>For any man with half an eye,</L>
<L>What stands before him may espy;</L>
<L>But optics sharp it needs, I ween,</L>
<L>To see what is not to be seen.</L>
<L>As in the days of ancient fame</L>
<L>Prophets and poets were the same,</L>
<L>And all the praise that poets gain</L>
<L>Is but for what th' invent and feign:</L>
<L>So gain'd our 'Squire his fame by seeing</L>
<L>Such things as never would have being.</L>
<L>Whence he for oracles was grown</L>
<L>The very <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"The Tripod was a sacred three-legged stool, from which the ancient priests uttered their oracles."</NOTE> tripod of his town.</L>
<L>Gazettes no sooner rose a lye in,</L>

This, however, cannot be the fault of our Hero, but rather the British Minister, who left off the war before the work was completed.</NOTE>.</L>
<L>All this, with spirit energetic,</L>
<L>He did by second-sight prophetic.</L>
<L>Thus stor'd with intellectual riches,</L>
<L>Skill'd was our 'Squire in making speeches,</L>
<L>Where strength of brains united centers</L>
<L>With strength of lungs surpassing Stentor's.</L>
<L>But as some muskets so contrive it,</L>
<L>As oft to miss the mark they drive at,</L>
<L>And tho' well aim'd at duck or plover,</L>
<L>Bear wide, and kick their owners over:</L>
<L>So far'd our 'Squire, whose reas'ning toil</L>
<L>Would often on himself recoil,</L>
<L>And so much injur'd more his side,</L>
<L>The stronger arg'ments he apply'd;</L>
<L>As old war elephants, dismay'd,</L>
<L>Trode down the troops they came to aid,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="029659_0013_0FE212C16516C428"/>And hurt their own side more in battle</L>

<L>Yet at town-meetings ev'ry chief</L>
<L>Pinn'd faith on great M'Fingal's sleeve,</L>
<L>And, as he motioned all by rote</L>
<L>Rais'd sympathetic hands to vote.</L>
<L>The town, our Hero's scene of action,</L>
<L>Had long been torn by feuds of faction;</L>
<L>And as each party's strength prevails,</L>
<L>It turn'd up diff'rent heads or tails;</L>
<L>With constant ratt'ling, in a trice</L>
<L>Show'd various sides, as oft as dice:</L>
<L>As that fam'd weaver, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Homers Odyssey</NOTE> wife t'Ulysses,</L>
<L>By night each day's-work pick'd in pieces;</L>
<L>And tho' she stoutly did bestir her,</L>
<L>Its finishing was ne'er the nearer:</L>
<L>So did this town with stedfast zeal</L>
<L>Weave cob-webs for the public weal,</L>
<L>Which when completed, or before,</L>
<L>A second vote in pieces tore.</L>
<L>They met, made speeches full long-winded,</L>
<L>Resolv'd, protested, and rescinded;</L>
<L>Addresses sign'd, then chose Committees,</L>

<L>But tho' so bright her sun might shine,</L>
<L>'Twas quickly hasting to decline,</L>
<L>With feeble rays, too weak t' assuage,</L>

<L>"For states, like men, are doom'd as well</L>

But the instigators wishing the Americans to be the aggressors, used the following stratagem to compleat their purpose.</P>
<P>On the first of May, 1775, the king's standard was to be erected at Worcester, fifty miles from Boston, when Lieutenant Colonel Nesbitt immortalized himself by executing this plan to promote the quarrel, and give the army an opportunity of their desired revenge.</P>
<P>A soldier, according to his directions, sold an old rusty musket to a countryman for three dollars, who brought vegetables to market. This could be no crime in the market-man, who had an undoubted right to purchase, and bear arms. He was, notwithstanding, immedi∣ately seized by Nesbitt, and conveyed to the guard-house, where he was confined all night. Early the next morning they stripped him naked, covere him with warm tar, and then with feathers, and conducted him to the north end of the town, then to the south end, and as far as Liberty-Tree, where they dismissed the man, through fear of the people, (who by this time had collected in large numbers,) and made a retreat to their barracks.</P>
<P>The party consisted of about thirty grenadiers of the 47th regiment with fixed bayonets, 20 drums and fifes playing the rogue's march, headed by Nesbitt with a drawn sword.</P>
<P>The magistrates of the town waited on General Gage with a com∣plaint of this outrage; he pretended disapprobation; but took no steps to censure the conduct of Nesbitt, or to do justice to the man who had suffered the violence.</P></NOTE>,</L>

When the people felt these particular acts of oppression from a power three thousand miles distant, their only method of redress was, to prevent any person from accepting an office, or from exercising its functions, under such an act. This expedient had been successful in the case of the Stamp-act a few years before; and the people now ap∣plied to Judge Oliver, requesting him to resign an office, the new ar∣rangement of which so manifestly struck at the foundation of their li∣berty.

Malcolm, the gallows-taught prophet, in pre∣paring the mind of M'Fingal to contemplate, with proper in∣telligence, the various scenes that are to rise successively to view in the course of the Vision, glances over the Continent, and mentions in this passage the principal scenes of action, from the expedition into Canada in 1775. to the capture of Lord Corn∣wallis in 1781. The concluding part of his speech is therefore a kind of <HI>argument</HI> to this whole book of Vision; in which the same objects are unfolded at large with their attendant circum∣stances; in order that they may make a proper impression on the elevated mind of the great M'Fingal. It is thus that our Poet, like Homer, in his Iliad, seizes all occasions to do honour to his principal hero. By supposing him already possessed of all natural and political knowledge that could be obtained by mortal study and experience, he makes him, like Achilles, capable of receiv∣ing instruction only by the agency of a super-terrestial power.

It accordingly passed an act repealing all the acts of which the Ameri∣cans complained, provided we would rescind our declaration of Inde∣pendence, and continue to be their colonies. The Ministry then sent over three Commissioners, Mr. Johnstone, Mr. Eden, and Lord Car∣lisle.
