<L>RANTING topers, midnight rovers,</L>

<L>Fix your thoughts on heavenly treasure,</L>

<LG>
<L>IN the first stillness of the even,</L>
<L>When blushing day began to close,</L>
<L>In the blissful bowers of Eden,</L>
<L>Our chaste Grand Parents sought repose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No pair to act love's glowing passion,</L>
<L>So fit, in these late days, are seen;</L>
<L>Since girls shapes are spoil'd by fashion,</L>
<L>And man's nerves unstrung by sin.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Eve,</HI> the fairest child of nature,</L>
<L>In naked beauty stood reveal'd,</L>
<L>Exposing every limb and feature,</L>
<L>Save those her jetty locks conceal'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Light and wanton curl'd her tresses</L>
<L>Where each sprouting lock should grow,</L>
<L>Her bosom, heaving for caresses,</L>
<L>Seem'd blushing berries cast on snow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Adam,</HI> got by lusty nature,</L>
<L>Form'd to delight a woman's eyes,</L>
<L>Stood confest in manly stature,</L>
<L>The first of men in shape and size!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="5" REF="026290_0004_0FCF8AE0752116E8"/>
<L>As <HI>Eve</HI> cast her arms so slender,</L>
<L>His brawny chest to fondly stroke;</L>
<L>She seem'd an ivy tendril tender</L>
<L>Sporting round a sturdy oak.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Innocent of nuptial blisses,</L>
<L>Unknown to him the balm of life;</L>
<L>With unmeaning, wild caresses,</L>
<L>Adam teaz'd his virgin wife.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As her arm Eve held him hard in,</L>
<L>And toy'd him with her roving hand,</L>
<L>In the middle of Love's Garden,</L>
<L>She saw the Tree of Knowledge stand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Stately grew the tree forbidden,</L>
<L>Rich curling tendrils grac'd its root;</L>
<L>In its airy pods, half hidden,</L>
<L>Hung the luscious, tempting fruit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With Love's coyest leer she view'd it,</L>
<L>Then touch'd it with her glowing hand;</L>
<L>Did just touch, but not renew'd it,</L>
<L>Restrain'd by the divine command.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="026290_0005_0FCFA92B6CB6ABA8"/>
<L>At her guilty touch the tree seem'd</L>
<L>Against the blue arch'd sky to knock;</L>
<L>With nervous vigour every branch beam'd,</L>
<L>And swell'd the sturdy solid stock.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Softly sigh'd the rib-form'd beauty,</L>
<L>"How love does new desires produce?</L>
<L>"This pendant fruit o'ercomes my duty,</L>
<L>"I pant to suck its balmy juice.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Why was this tall tree forbidden,</L>
<L>"So sweet and pleasant to my eyes,</L>
<L>"Food so fit for hungry women,</L>
<L>"Much desir'd to make me wise?"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With sweet blandishment so civil,</L>
<L>She finger'd soft its velvet pods;</L>
<L>"Let us now know good from evil,</L>
<L>"Dear Adam, let us be like Gods."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With burning cheeks and eyes of fire,</L>
<L>Raving and raging for the bliss,</L>
<L>Blushing and panting with desire,</L>
<L>She glue'd her glowing lips to his.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="026290_0006_0FCF8B039F47B890"/>
<L>"Threaten'd death will soon o'ertake me,</L>
<L>"If this forbidden tree I pluck,</L>
<L>"But life itself will soon forsake me,</L>
<L>"Unless its cordial juice I suck."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Her soft hand then half embrac'd it,</L>
<L>Her heaving breasts to his inclin'd,</L>
<L>She op'd her coral lips to taste it,</L>
<L>But first she peel'd its russet rind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In her lips she scarcely put it,</L>
<L>And nibbl'd 'till its sweets she found,</L>
<L>Then like eager glutton took it,</L>
<L>And, gorg'd with bliss, sunk on the ground.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At that hour, through all creation,</L>
<L>Rode Love sublime in triumph then,</L>
<L>Earth, Sea, Air, gave gratulation,</L>
<L>And all their offspring joy'd like them.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fish that sported in the Gihon,</L>
<L>Soaring Eagles, cooing Doves,</L>
<L>Leopard, Panther, Wolf and Lion,</L>
<L>Reptile and Insect joy'd their loves.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="026290_0007_0FCF8ADEE59060F8"/>
<L>Love's fierce fire seiz'd e'en the posies,</L>
<L>Which deck'd the gay enamell'd mead,</L>
<L>Amorous pinks and wanton roses,</L>
<L>Dissolv'd in love, all shed their seed!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Eve, transported beyond measure,</L>
<L>Stretch'd in every vital part;</L>
<L>Fainting with excess of pleasure,</L>
<L>For mighty knowledge rift her heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But when its nectar'd juice she tasted,</L>
<L>Dissolving Eve could only sigh;</L>
<L>"I feel—I feel, my life is wasted,</L>
<L>"This hour I eat, and now I die."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But when she saw the tree so lofty,</L>
<L>Sapless and shrunk in size so small;</L>
<L>Pointing;—she whisper'd Adam softly:</L>
<L>"See! there is DEATH! and there's the FALL!"</L>
