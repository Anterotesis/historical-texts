<STAGE>Jacob <HI>and</HI> George Friendly sens.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Friend. sen.</SPEAKER>
<P>YOU and I, brother, ne∣ver did, or ever will agree on this subject. You know the terms upon which I took your son; I adopted him as my own child, and hold myself responsible for his conduct.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. Friend. sen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Little dost thou know his cha∣racter, and much do I repent of putting him under thy direction; it will be the ruin of him, soul and body.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Friend. sen.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Sdeath, Jacob, what do you mean by such reflections? They are enough to make one quarrel with you outright. After all the expense I have been at, in giving him the first-rate education, don't he possess all those neces∣sary accomplishments which constitute the agree∣able
<PB N="14" REF="029129_0011_0FDFA8DBE761FC48"/>
companion▪—and yet you say I have ruin∣ed him, soul and body.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. Friend. sen.</SPEAKER>
<P>What thou doth call accom∣plishments, brother, are what lead him the broad∣way to destruction; there is scarce a night but I hear of his disorderly behaviour; dost thou not think that these reports hurt me, who am the father of the young man?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Friend. sen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Parents often create themselves unnecessary trouble by being too particular with their children—you multiply all the foibles of your son into vices, and make no allowances for the sprightly sallies of youth; we will see which will turn out the cleverest fellow, him or your primitive son, whom you are bringing up in the straight path.
<STAGE>(Ironically.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. Friend. sen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would that George was like unto Jacob! What a consolation would it be to my mind! It would be a healing comfort, bro∣ther.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Friend. sen.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I am sure it would be mortifying to me if George was like unto, Ja∣cob; I mean him for a different sphere in life, and trust some of those days he will make a fi∣gure; I know him—the seeds of greatness are planted in his breast, and time and reflection will make them blossom fair to the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>J. Friend. sen.</SPEAKER>
<P>The great danger is, that the rank weeds of vice will overgrow the seeds of virtue: thou hast been too indulgent to him; and where thou hast been most to blame, was in making him too independent of thee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>Brother, these are narrow, contrac∣ted notions; it is destroying every idea of
<PB N="15" REF="029129_0012_0FDFA8DD9B0A8BE0"/>
independence to have a person hanging on one, a wretched dependant; I have placed George in easy circumstances: I know he will be grateful, and make use of his money like a gentleman; come let us go and see Hannah and Rachel.</P>

<SPEAKER>G. Friend. jun.</SPEAKER>
<P>There goes the hope of the fa∣mily—daddy's pet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major Manly.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is a good kind of a lad.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Friend. jun.</SPEAKER>
<P>A sly fellow, depend on't— Harry, methinks you look very brilliant; this has been a grand parade day—a fine sparkling hilted sword—now tell me truly is there not vanity in dangling that fine affair by your side?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major Manly.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, George, not a particle; but I feel a conscious pride in wearing it, for
<PB N="16" REF="029129_0013_0FDFA8DFDA1ECC50"/>
these reasons:—it has been my trusty friend in the hour of danger; and the first moment I gir∣ded it on this side, I subscribed my name to our glorious independence, which I will support while I have breath.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Friend. jun.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a Don Quixote in po∣litics! you were always an enthusiast in that way, Harry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major Manly.</SPEAKER>
<P>I glory in being an enthusiast in the cause of liberty and my country; and esteem it the most fortunate circumstance of my life, that I have been instrumental in effecting a re∣volution which has given freedom to millions living, and will secure it to millions yet unborn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Friend. jun.</SPEAKER>
<P>A political prophet, too—I hope you will not prove a false one. Our national go∣vernment has its enemies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major Manly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not a great many: it is the nature of a popular government, like ours, for party-spirit to prevail.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Friend. jun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some will tell you it is the life and soul of a republican government: it kept the lamp of liberty burning at Rome a long time, but, unfortunately, extinguished it at last.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major Manly.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have nothing of that kind to fear among us: a great majority of the citi∣zens of the united states are sufficiently enlight∣ened to judge for themselves: they will not be led away or imposed upon by designing men of any description whatever: they, I trust, set a just value upon one of the best constitutions that ever was framed for the government of man. What people on earth, save ourselves, can boast of so free and equal a representation, or of choosing
<PB N="17" REF="029129_0014_0FDFA8E62F029778"/>
their chief magistrate? What people under hea∣ven enjoy civil and religious liberty with that pu∣rity we do? With such advantages, and under such a government, how can we but be happy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Friend. jun.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is no doubt but we are, and may continue to be the happiest people on the face of the globe; but let us throw politics aside, and converse about the affairs of the world in general. Have you heard any thing that is wonderful through the day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major Manly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not a sentence: methinks the town seems very dull.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Friend. jun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha! dull indeed. Where have you concealed yourself?—Here man—see what a volume of invitations I have: I am engaged to dinners, tea-parties, and balls, for the month to come.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major Manly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really, really, Friendly, you are in great demand;—much in fashion among the belles; I wonder you don't single out one from the fair flock for matrimony.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Friend. jun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Matrimony, eh!—no, no, Har∣ry;—as the song goes,
<Q><L><STAGE>(Sings.)</STAGE>
I'll kiss and hug,</L>
<L>And shake a brogue,
<STAGE>(dances)</STAGE></L>
<L>Like a merry, merry rogue,</L>
<L>But hang me if I marry.</L></Q></P>
<P>No, no, Harry, hang me if I marry—unless I could have a thousand wives.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major Manly.</SPEAKER>
<P>What an extravagant rogue thou art! I should think myself supremely blest with one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Friend. jun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Apropos, Major: how do you
<PB N="18" REF="029129_0015_0FDFA8E89F97CC90"/>
come on in that business?—won't father give consent?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major Manly.</SPEAKER>
<P>He will not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Friend. jun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Run away with her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major Manly.</SPEAKER>
<P>That would be dishonourable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Friend. jun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha, honour indeed! do you talk of honour in love matters? Love is not to be restricted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Major Manly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, rational love may be; though your sister is the dear and first object of my affections, and one in whom all my earthly happiness is centered, yet such are my no∣tions of honour, that were she to put herself under my protection, I think I could not basely steal her from her parents.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G. Friend. jun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Harke, Major, you have ac∣quired much reputation under the banner of Mars, but I am afraid you have too much ho∣nour to make any great figure under that of Venus.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Trifle.</SPEAKER>
<P>George, my worthy fellow, how are you? Major, most noble Major, I kiss your hand. The news, gentlemen, tell me at once; I am on the wing in pursuit of the finest girl that ever was viewed by mortal man.</P>

<P>I lost her by the strangest accident that ever happened to man: I will tell you the whole story. As I was addressing her in her own lan∣guage, you know I speak French very well, while I was holding her in conversation, a dog was chasing a monstrous great hog, just out of the wallow,—and what must the damn'd brute do, but run between my legs, and throw me off my centre, to the great mirth of the spectators.</P>

<P>I am confident thou art actuated by no other motive. I am sensible of Manly's worth; and was I at liberty to act for myself▪ he would be my choice: but my parents are to be satisfied upon that point; and such are the

<P>The indignant flash from her eye, shot presumption dead. I have got myself into a pretty scrape: to what lengths has my vanity carried me! by heaven it was ill done; a lady, who is a pattern of virtue; one who al∣ways treated me with the utmost hospitality: what the devil could possess me to put such a vicious construction upon her prudent injunc∣tion.
<STAGE>(<HI>Walks in agitation</HI>)</STAGE>
I see now the whole affair. Peevish has become jealous of his wife, without just cause, I am sure. He, in order to come at her supposed inconstancy, has affected to prosecute a journey, but in fact has remain∣ed in town, and assumed the dress of a woman, lurked about the house, to be a ready spy upon the actions of his lady.
<STAGE>(<HI>pauses</HI>)</STAGE>
How am I to act in this affair? I must write a penitent letter to Mrs. Peevish; but what the devil shall I say to Peevish? I will go and beg his pardon for the dishonor intended him. If he should require other satisfaction, I shall be rendered extremely unhappy, though not afraid to meet him; yet as I have been the aggressor, it would be adding injury to insult. Peevish is a man of understan∣ding, though of a fretful temper. I hope he will be satisfied with due concessions, and the mat∣ter be hushed: thus I go on sinning and repen∣ting, repenting and sinning.

He was as jealous of her as the de∣vil could make him, and now he is as fond of her as if she was not his wife; and she hangs upon him as if she loved him from the bottom of her shoul.

Depend up∣on it, too constant a repetition of those mid∣night revels, will neither promote your health, nor establish you a fair reputation in the world. To be serious with you, George, I wish you to enter into the banns of wedlock. Cast your eyes around you. Single out some lady, whom you may think worthy of your affection. It mat∣ters not, whether she has wealth, provided she has merit. For my part, I would rather have you form a connection with a woman of a mo∣derate share of beauty, with good sense, and an amiable disposition, if she had not a second change, than to one that would bring you thousands, and lead you a termagant life.</P>

<P>Now, Pat, you have got a wife. Tho' I am made extramely happy by being married to Jenny; yet it occasions me some sorrowful thoughts. Now, the great question is, how I am to kape her and the children alive. By my shoul, I never wished to be rich before.—I ne∣ver did like kaping company with those four-footed bastes: besides, it is a devil of a hard life. One is oblaged to turn out in the snow and cold at very unshasonably hours, and there is no grate dale got by it after all. One may be riding about the whole yare, and at the end of it, be just where they walked off from, without a farthing the better. Now, I think, if I had about three, or two hundred dollars, I could shut up a grate store; and it appares clare to me, I could make a grate dale of money. Jen∣ny tells me, that many of my countrymen came here very poor, and have made grate fortunes out of nothing at all at all; and with the bles∣sings of heaven, Pat will do it too.
