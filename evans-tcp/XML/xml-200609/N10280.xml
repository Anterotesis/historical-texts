<P>"PRAY what does the author mean?" is the first question most readers will ask, and the last they are able to answer. Therefore in a word I will explain the subject and design of the following poem.</P>
<P>The subject is the state of the times in regard to literature and religion. The author was prompt∣ed to write by a hope that it might be of use to point out, in a clear, concise, and striking manner, those general errors, that hinder the advantages of education, and the growth of piety. The subject is inexhaustible; nor is my design yet completed. This first part describes the principal mistakes in one course of life, and exemplifies the following well-known truth, That to the frequent scandal, as well of religion, as learning, a fellow, without any share of genius, or application to study, may pass with credit through life, receive the honors of a liberal education, and be admitted to the right hand of fellowship among ministers of the gospel. That, except in one neighbouring province, ignorance wanders unmolested at our colleges, examinations are dwindled to mere form and ceremony, and after four years dozing there, no one is ever refused the honors of a degree, on account of dulness and in∣sufficiency. That the <HI>meer</HI> knowledge of antient
<PB N="vi" REF="013050_0004_0F8FF665397EA0C0"/>
languages, of the abstruser parts of mathematics, and the dark researches of metaphysics, is of little advantage in any business or profession in life. That it would be more beneficial, in every place of public education, to take pains in teaching the elements of oratory, the grammar of the English tongue, and the elegancies of style, and composi∣tion. That in numberless instances throughout these colonies, sufficient care hath not been taken to exclude the ignorant and irreligious, from the sacred desk. That this tenderness to the unde∣serving, tends to debase the dignity of the clergy, and to hinder many worthy men from undertaking the office of the ministry. And that the virulent controversies of the present day concerning reli∣gious, or in many cases, meerly speculative opi∣nions, savouring so highly of vanity and ostenta∣tion, and breathing a spirit so opposite to chris∣tian benevolence, have done more hurt to the cause of religion, than all the malice, the ridicule, and the folly of its enemies.</P>

<HEAD>THE PROGRESS OF DULNESS.</HEAD>
<L>"OUR <HI>Tom</HI> is grown a sturdy boy;</L>
<L>His progress fills my heart with joy;</L>
<L>A steady soul that yields to rule,</L>
<L>And quite ingenious too, at school.</L>
<L>Our master says, (I'm sure he's right)</L>
<L>There's not a lad in town so bright.</L>
<L>He'll cypher bravely, write and read,</L>
<L>And say his catechism and creed,</L>
<L>And scorns to hesitate or faulter</L>
<L>In primmer, spelling-book or psalter.</L>
<L>Hard work indeed—he does not love it;</L>
<L>His genius is too much above it.</L>
<L>Give him a good substantial teacher,</L>
<L>I'll lay he makes a special preacher.</L>
<L>I've lov'd good learning all my life:</L>
<L>We'll send the lad to college, wife."</L>
<L>Thus sway'd by fond and sightless passion,</L>
<L>His parents hold a consultation:</L>
<L>If on their couch, or round their fire,</L>
<L>I need not tell, nor you enquire.</L>
<L>The point's agreed; the boy well pleas'd,</L>
<L>From country cares and labour eas'd;</L>
<L>No more to rise by break of day</L>
<L>To drive home cows, or deal out hay;</L>
<L>To work no more in snow or hail,</L>
<L>And blow his fingers o'er the flail,</L>
<L>Or mid the toils of harvest sweat</L>
<L>Beneath the summer's sultry heat.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="013050_0006_0F8FF66690931290"/>Serene, he bids the farm, good-bye,</L>
<L>And quits the plow without a sigh.</L>
<L>Propitious to their constant friend,</L>
<L>The pow'rs of idleness attend.</L>
<L>So to the priest in form he goes,</L>
<L>Prepar'd to study and to doze.</L>
<L>The Parson in his youth before,</L>
<L>Had run the same dull progress o'er:</L>
<L>His sole concern to see with care</L>
<L>His church, and farm in good repair.</L>
<L>His skill in tongues, that once he knew,</L>
<L>Had bid him long, a last adieu;</L>
<L>Away his latin rules had fled,</L>
<L>And Greek had vanish'd from his head.</L>
<L>Then view our youth with grammar teazing.</L>
<L>Untaught in meaning, sense or reason;</L>
<L>Of knowledge e'er he gain his fill, he</L>
<L>Must diet long on husks of <HI>Lillie,</HI></L>
<L>Drudge on for weary months in vain,</L>
<L>By mem'ry's strength, and dint of brain;</L>
<L>From thence to murd'ring <HI>Virgil</HI>'s verse,</L>
<L>And construing <HI>Tully</HI> into farce,</L>
<L>Or lab'ring with his grave preceptor,</L>
<L>In Greek to blunder o'er a chapter.</L>
<L>The latin testament affords</L>
<L>The needed help of ready words;</L>
<L>At hand the dictionary laid,</L>
<L>Gives up it's page in frequent aid;</L>
<L>Hard by the lexicon and grammar,</L>
<L>Those helps for mem'ry when they stammer;</L>
<L>The lesson's short; the priest contented;</L>
<L>His task to hear is sooner ended.</L>
<L>He lets him mind his own concerns,</L>
<L>Then tells his parents how he learns.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="013050_0007_0F8FF66856912920"/>A year thus spent in gathering knowledge,</L>
<L>The lad sets forth t' unlade at college,</L>
<L>While down his sire and priest attend him,</L>
<L>To introduce and recommend him:</L>
<L>Or if detain'd, a letter's sent</L>
<L>Of much apocryphal content,</L>
<L>To set him forth, (how dull soever)</L>
<L>As very learn'd and very clever;</L>
<L>A genius of the first emission,</L>
<L>With burning love for erudition;</L>
<L>So studious he'll outwatch the moon</L>
<L>And think the planets set too soon;</L>
<L>He had but little time to fit in;</L>
<L>Examination too must frighten;</L>
<L>Depend upon't he must do well,</L>
<L>He knows much more than he can tell;</L>
<L>Admit him, and in little space</L>
<L>He'll beat his rivals in the race;</L>
<L>His father's incomes are but small,</L>
<L>He comes now, if he comes at all.</L>
<L>So said, so done, at college now</L>
<L>He enters well—no matter how—</L>
<L>New scenes awhile his fancy please,</L>
<L>But all must yield to love of ease.</L>
<L>In the same round condemn'd each day,</L>
<L>To study, read, recite and pray;</L>
<L>To make his hours of business double—</L>
<L>He can't endure th' increasing trouble:</L>
<L>And finds at length, as times grow pressing,</L>
<L>All plagues are easier than his lesson.</L>
<L>With sleepy eyes and count'nance heavy,</L>
<L>With much excuse of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Non paravi,</HI> I have not prepared for recitation. An excuse commonly given.</NOTE> <HI>non paravi,</HI></L>

<L>The college-evil on him seizes.</L>
<L>Then ev'ry book, which ought to please,</L>

<L>Greek spoils his eyes (the print's so fine)</L>
<L>Grown dim with study—and with wine;</L>
<L>Of <HI>Tully's</HI> latin much afraid,</L>
<L>Each page, he calls the doctor's aid;</L>
<L>While geometry, with lines so crooked,</L>
<L>Sprains all his wits to overlook it.</L>
<L>His sickness puts on every name.</L>
<L>It's cause and uses still the same;</L>
<L>'Tis tooth-ach, cholic, gout or stone,</L>
<L>With phases various as the moon:</L>
<L>But though through all the body spread,</L>
<L>Still makes its cap'tal seat, the head.</L>
<L>In all diseases, 'tis expected,</L>
<L>The weakest parts be most infected.</L>

<L>Who mid the still and dreary bound,</L>

<L>Thy vot'ries bid a bold defiance</L>
<L>To all the calls and threats of science,</L>
<L>Slight learning human and divine,</L>
<L>And hear no prayers, and fear no fine.</L>
<L>And yet how oft the studious gain,</L>
<L>The dulness of a letter'd brain;</L>
<L>Despising such low things the while</L>
<L>As English grammar, phrase and style;</L>

<L>Your highborn dignity attend,</L>
<L>And view your origin and end.</L>
<L>While human souls are all your care,</L>
<L>By warnings, counsels, preaching, prayer,</L>
<L>In bands of christian friendship join'd,</L>
<L>Where pure affection warms the mind,</L>
<L>While each performs the pious race,</L>
<L>Nor dulness e'er usurps a place;</L>
<L>No vice shall brave your awful test,</L>
<L>Nor folly dare to broach the jest,</L>
<L>Each waiting eye shall humbly bend,</L>
<L>And rev'rence on your steps attend.</L>
<L>But when each point of serious weight,</L>
<L>Is torne with wrangling and debate,</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="013050_0017_0F8FF6728F082118"/>When truth, mid rage of dire divisions,</L>
<L>Is left, to fight for definitions,</L>
<L>And fools assume your sacred place,</L>
<L>It threats your order with disgrace;</L>
<L>Bids genius from your seats withdraw,</L>
<L>And seek the pert, loquacious law;</L>
<L>Or deign in physic's paths to rank,</L>
<L>With ev'ry quack and mountebank;</L>
<L>Or in the ways of trade content,</L>
<L>Plod ledgers o'er of <HI>cent. per cent.</HI></L>
<L>While in your seats so sacred, whence</L>
<L>We look for piety and sense,</L>
<L>Pert dulness raves in school-boy style;</L>
<L>Your friends must blush, your foes will smile.</L>
<L>While men, who teach the glorious way,</L>
<L>Where heav'n unfolds celestial day,</L>
<L>Assume the task sublime, to bring</L>
<L>The message of th' eternal King,</L>
<L>Disgrace those honors they receive,</L>
<L>And want that sense, they aim to give.</L>
<L>Now in the desk with solemn air,</L>
<L>Our hero makes his audience stare;</L>
<L>Asserts with all dogmatic boldness,</L>
<L>Where impudence is yok'd to dulness;</L>
<L>Reads o'er his notes with halting pace,</L>
<L>Mask'd in the stiffness of his face;</L>
<L>With gestures such as might become</L>
<L>Those statues once that spoke at <HI>Rome,</HI></L>
<L>Or <HI>Livy</HI>'s ox, that to the state</L>
<L>Declar'd the oracles of fate,</L>
<L>In awkward tones, nor said, nor sung,</L>
<L>Slow-rumbling o'er the faltring tongue,</L>
<L>Two hours his drawling speech holds on,</L>
<L>And names it preaching when he's done.</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="013050_0018_0F8FF6729E44A840"/>With roving tir'd, he fixes down</L>
<L>For life, in some unsettled town.</L>
<L>People and priest full well agree;</L>
<L>For why—they know no more than he.</L>
<L>Vast tracts of unknown lands he gains,</L>
<L>Better than those the moon contains:</L>
<L>There deals in preaching and in prayer,</L>
<L>And starves on sixty pounds a year,</L>
<L>And culls his texts, and tills his farm,</L>
<L>And does no good, and little harm;</L>
<L>On sunday, in his best array,</L>
<L>Deals forth the dulness of the day;</L>
<L>And while above he spends his breath,</L>
<L>The yawning audience nod beneath.</L>
<L>Thus glib-tongu'd <HI>Merc'ry</HI> in his hand</L>
<L>Stretch'd forth the sleep-compelling wand,</L>
<L>Each eye in endless doze to keep—</L>
<L>The God of speaking, and of sleep.</L>
