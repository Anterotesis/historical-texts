<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author of this and former essays may be charged by some with presumption; from the harsh critic and illiberal classic, he expects but little mercy: on the other hand, he looks for every indulgence from the liberal critic and generous clas∣sic. The author does not presume to rank himself among the learned; he is sensible of the disadvan∣tages he labours under in point of education and situation in life; he, however, will not give up the right of defending himself against the assertions of two partial and narrow-minded men. That he has been most shamefully treated by the managers of the new theatre, he will make appear to the Reader, by the following circumstances: ......</P>
<P>The <HI>Triumphs of Love</HI> was brought before the bar of the Public, on friday evening, May <HI>22</HI>d, <HI>1795,</HI> and acquitted with as much honour, as the Au∣thor could wish (considering the curtailed manner in which it was performed.) At the instance of a number of gentlemen the piece was printed. On the opening of the theatre the ensuing season, the Author requested the managers to give it a second represen∣tation,.....they refused,.....the Author appealed to the Public,.....they replied,.....he replied in turn, but the
<PB N="iv" REF="038011_0003_100FB8ECEE159F68"/>
doors of the press were shut against him (he believ∣ed) through the influence of the managers.</P>
<P>The following are the pieces alluded to:

<SALUTE>MR. BROWN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Knowing that a great number of the citizens are daily expecting to hear the <HI>Triumphs of Love, or the Happy Reconconciliation,</HI> announced for per∣formance, it is requisite that they should be inform∣ed how that piece is situated, by A FAIR RECITAL OF FACTS.</P>
<P>Occasionally visiting the theatre, I was, at times, much disgusted, to see and hear pieces performed, so foreign to the circumstances of a republican peo∣ple; which prompted me, at my leisure moments, to throw my ideas into a proper train to produce a drama, which would be more consonanant to the ears of Americans. Upon accomplishing a piece, and aware of the foible common to human nature, of being too partial to what originates with our∣selves, I put it, for perusal, into the hands of seve∣ral persons, whom I know to be judges of that pe∣culiar species of writing: it was returned by them with high encomiums. I was requested by them to submit it to the managers of the new theatre: pur∣suing their advice, I did. Some weeks it lay with them; they finally rejected it. I informed the gentlemen of their dicision, they were not a little surprised, and expressed themselves in terms of in∣dignation; there matters rested. The piece was
<PB N="v" REF="038011_0004_100FB8EE72BC6358"/>
thrown aside to sleep, as I supposed the sleep of death. The flower was born, and as I expected, to blush unseen forever from the public eye: but upon the opening of the new theatre on the ensuing sea∣son, I was again requested by the alluded to friends of the piece to present it once more to the managers. I replied, it was in vain; comparatively speaking, it would be like opposing a feather to a strong north-wester. I told them I thought I dis∣covered a confirmed temper in the managers to tram∣ple on native productions. They wished me to give it up to them, and leave it to their manage∣ment. I accordingly did. They waited upon the managers with it, were promised by them to pay it due attention. There it remained a length of time, without receiving a direct answer, though they were frequently importuned to give one, or return the play. At last, beyond the eleventh hour, it was shoved into the world, unmercifully dissected by, (what was called by the managers) necessary ex∣pungings. Notwithstanding its mutilated state, it was received with the strongest marks of approba∣tion, by one of the most respectable audiences the house ever contained. That, and the flattering compliments I had paid me the next day, joined with the desire of many, induced me to have it pub∣lished: by so doing, I am out of pocket. Some∣time ago, I sent the managers a second composition, an after-piece in two acts; informed them how I was circumstanced with respect to the first; observed that if the two were played in concert, there was no doubt but in all human probability they would have
<PB N="vi" REF="038011_0005_100FB8EFF958B9A0"/>
an overflowing house, and it would give a start to the sale of my first piece. But they were not disposed to perform either; the reasons given, were not of the most forcible kind......I shall conclude, by asserting to the managers, in the full face of the Public, that the <HI>Triumphs of Love, or Happy Reconciliation,</HI> with all the imperfections which they or those who influ∣enced them, may charge it with, as it was well re∣ceived in the first instance, has an undoubted right of taking its place or chance with other pieces in the early part of the season.</P>

<P>The following answer appeared in the same gazette, the next evening:
<LETTER>
<P>The essay by the Author of the <HI>Triumphs of Love, or Happy Reconciliation,</HI> in the gazette of yes∣terday, cannot (a correspondent remarks) carry with it, to a judicious Public, any reflections on the mana∣gers of the new theatre. That Author certainly mis∣placed his abilities when they were employed in the production of a dramatic performance.....of this, the citizens had an opportunity of judging last season, at the theatre. The <HI>Happy Reconciliation</HI> has been published, and few who have read it would wish to spend an evening to see it represented. It is absurd to suppose the managers have an inclination to trample on native productions, when they possess merit. The managers have embarked in a business which is attended with a very heavy expense, and it is their duty to bring forward the most celebrated
<PB N="vii" REF="038011_0006_100FB8F2ADE5D508"/>
pieces which are to be found in the English language, whether American or English productions.</P>
</LETTER></P>
<P>The proceeding answer was handed to Mr. <HI>Brown:</HI>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MR. BROWN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Want of time prevented me from replying to a correspondent in your paper of the 25th instant, who has undertaken to espouse the cause of the man∣agers of the new theatre.... The correspondent takes a stride over a greater part of what he calls, the Au∣thor's essay, without answering his complaints against them, but throws them upon the mercy of the Pub∣lic. The correspondent observes, "The Author certainly misplaced his abilities when employed in the dramatic line, of that, the citizens had an op∣portunity of judging last season, at the theatre."..... What would the correspondent be at; what is his inference? Surely he will not be so bold as to insin∣uate that the comedy was not well received; or does he suppose that a piece performed amid the plaudits of a numerous and a respectable assembly was not some evidence of its merit? Is this handsome of the managers, is it fair in their agent, the correspon∣dent? With respect to the Author's misplacing his talent, as the correspondent remarks, he has no rea∣son to believe he has; it is one of Nature's choicest gifts, which he will cultivate at convenient seasons: perhaps the time will come when we shall have man∣agers of more enlarged minds. The correspondent takes notice that "The <HI>Happy Reconciliation</HI> has been
<PB N="viii" REF="038011_0007_100FB8F7B97F7798"/>
published, and few who have read it, would wish to spend an evening to see it performed." What a limping assertion is that.....how has the correspon∣dent obtained his information? Has he heard the general opinion of those who have read the piece, or does he according to the countryman's phrase, mea∣sure other people's corn by his bushel. The cor∣respondent concludes by observing, "It is the duty of the managers to bring forward pieces of merit whe∣ther of American or European production." To che∣rish native productions is evidently their duty, but it is doubted by some, whether they conceive it to be their interest. It is believed by many, that while ever they can play off their old threadbare pieces, or new ones which they have nothing but the trouble of bringing up, the poor native dramatist may throw his mantle over his head, and mourn in silence. No premiums, no benefits to be given for imported dra∣mas The fear of a benefit is the rub which star∣tles the managers and makes their souls shrink within them. The Author again concludes with the corre∣spondent as he did with the managers; as the <HI>Tri∣uphs of Love, or the Happy Reconcilition</HI> was cor∣dially received on its first appearance, according to European usages it has a positive right to a second representation.</P>
</LETTER></P>
<P>This answer, Mr. <HI>Brown</HI> refused to insert: the Author then carried it to Mr. <HI>Bache</HI> (who had ex∣tracted the managers' reply from Mr. <HI>Brown's</HI> paper) he also refused to insert it.</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="038011_0008_100FB8F944D749D0"/>The Author will make further remarks on the last part of the managers' reply. They say, "They conceive it their duty to bring forward the most cele∣brated pieces which are to be found in the English language." This they have not done; they have im∣posed a number of plays on the American Public, which were with much difficulty dragged over the English stage. I could instance many, but will confine myself to two, viz. <HI>Cheap Living;</HI> and <HI>Knave or not.</HI></P>

<P>The principal novelty in this piece is the cha∣racter of Sir Edward Bloomsly, a boy of the age of sixteen, who is not only completely versed in all the scenes of dissipation; but is endowed also with a greater portion of wisdom than generally falls to the lot of men of double his age: we cannot approve of this delineation, which we consider as improbable and unnatural, and liable to do mischief to the rising generation: we think the present mode of education is too liable already, to tempt inexperienced youth to tread the path of folly, where their virtue and pro∣perty are too often lost: we therefore consider the performance as having an immoral tendency.</P>

<P>This comedy has both merits and defects. The drift of the piece is favourable to virtue; but the sa∣tire is rather that of Juvenal than Horace, and hard∣ly that of the comic muse: in the grave scenes, the language is vigorous and animated; but the comic ones want sprightfulness and elegance. As a per∣formance which has a tendency to make mankind dissatisfied with each other, by the gloomy view it gives of human nature, we are not surprised at the cold reception it met with.</P>

<P>This piece, which was performed to a very re∣spectable audience, on monday evening, is certain∣ly one of the most servile and insipid productions that ever disgraced the boards of a well regulated theatre: respecting it, any exertion of impartial criticism would be needless; it is composed of ma∣terials so repugnant to genius, and so diffusive of dul∣ness that submitting to the obscurity it must soon be inevitably doomed to, we shall add no other eu∣logiums on its sublimity, than to acknowledge it must be seen to be admired, heard to be understood.</P>

<P>Such are the choice comedies which the managers bring forward to an American audience, as the most celebrated pieces which are to be found in the Eng∣lish language, so much for that assertion.....Again.... It is absurd (say these self-important gentlemen) to sup∣pose the managers have an inclination to trample on na∣tive productions, when they possess merit. What is cal∣led refusing to perform a second time, a native piece, which was well received on the first representation; does not this appear like trampling on native productions. The managers may say they have lately given a proof to the contrary, by giving several representations to a new comedy, entitled the <HI>Wedding in Wales,</HI> said to be writ∣ten by a citizen of Philadelphia, which has been called a native production: true, the piece may have been written in Philadelphia, but the author might as well have wrote it in Wales, or any other part of England, and presented it to the managers in London, for representation, where it might have met the same fate as the above-mentioned pie∣ces, and afterwards ushered upon our stage, as one of the most celebrated pieces to be found in the English language. The Author takes the liberty of extracting (from <HI>Brown</HI>'s gazette of March the <HI>11</HI>th last) some thoughts on the piece before it was acted.</P>

<P>The friends of taste and the drama, will learn with pleasure, that an original performance is an∣nounced for representation. The genius of Ameri∣ca has too long been reproached with the poverty and sterility of its productions. Few persons have been sufficiently bold to appear before the Public as candidates for literary fame; and it is to be regret∣ted, that among those, some, whose productions have merited a better fate, have been treated with indif∣ference or neglect.</P>
<P>The dignity of the American theatre, has too long been impaired by the almost exclusive representa∣tion of foreign plays, which, however well adapted they may be to the state of European manners, lose much of that interes there which they excited in the places of their nativity; nothing perhaps, has more repressed the reputation of dramatic amuse∣ments in this country, than total reliance on foreign productions: and it may not be incorrect to assert that no theatre merits extensive patronage, which does not excite and cherish the cultivation and exer∣cise of domestic talents.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>This writer no doubt had an intention to serve the Author of the <HI>Wedding in Wales:</HI> but unfortunately, his observation are against him, and operate most forcibly against the managers. He observes, "the dignity of the American theatre has too long been impaired by the, almost exclusive representation of foreign plays, which
<PB N="xiii" REF="038011_0012_100FB932982B2628"/>
however well adapted they may be to the state of Euro∣pean manners, lose much of that interest here, which they excited in the places of their nativity." It may be enqui∣red, whether the <HI>Wedding in Wales,</HI> is not as foreign in its nature, as any play that ever appeared on our stage?</P>
<P>The Author takes the liberty of introducing an abridg∣ment of strictures on the <HI>Wedding in Wales</HI> (as they appeared in Mr <HI>Brown</HI>'s gazette of the <HI>15</HI>th of March last, signed Neander) from <HI>Porcupine</HI>'s gazette of March <HI>16</HI>th the whole being too lengthy.</P>

<HEAD>THE WEDDING IN WALES.</HEAD>
<P>The interest of the piece commences with the introduction of Maria, and is from thence strongly kept up to the conclusion: but this interest is exci∣ted and supported more by the peculiar situation of the parties, than by any powerful poetic skill, or those feeling touches and irresistable applications to the human heart, in which Shakespeare so abounds. Human misery ever excites human sympathy, with∣out the assistance of poetry; and it is no difficult thing to bring people into trouble: a distracted, in∣jured woman, with dishevelled hair; an old, worthy and unfortunate man, exposed to a pitiless storm; and an innocent, helpless and friendless infant, are easily imagined, and cannot fail to excite interest. If we think of Lear in the same situation, Llowell∣en claims but little of our attention.</P>
<P>The story of Maria is interesting and affecting, but I find very little novelty in it. The principal incidents, and even some of the more minute ones,
<PB N="xiv" REF="038011_0013_100FB905CA463FC0"/>
such as the real priest and license having been used instead of a false one, through the agency of the servant of a perfidious master, is an old contrivance. Sometime since, I accidentally picked up on my kitchen table, a little book, entitled "The History of the Farmer's Daughter," in which the history of Maria is, among other things, very strongly pour∣trayed; we there find this same deception practised by a servant on his master, respecting the priest and the license; and the circumstance of the ap∣prehension of Maria, as a vagrant may also be found in it. As I have never seen this book any where else, and as it is very coarsely written, I sup∣pose its circulation is principally among chamber∣maids.</P>
<P>It will not I think, be contested, that the play has any originality of character or much skill in the conduct and contrivance of the plot: of wit and humour it is almost entirely destitute.</P>
<P>It is confidently asserted, that the piece has been written for the performers, and the several charac∣ters drawn and cast for their supposed particular merits: I know not if the fact be so, but nothing can be more contemptible, nothing more certainly ensures a speedy death to a play: it has incorpo∣rated with it the seeds of its own dissolution. A play should be written after nature, and not after players...... to see a poet descending to take mea∣sure of an actor, and cast out his performance accordingly, instead of the actor adapting himself
<PB N="xv" REF="038011_0014_100FB9347A0729E0"/>
to the poet, is a ridiculous, unpardonable inversion of every thing honourable or dignified in authorship.</P>

<P>On friday evening was performed a comedy (said to be written by a citizen of Philadelphia) called the <HI>Triumphs of Love, or the Happy Reconciliation.</HI> The piece, though wanting in incident to make it inte∣resting, has some degree of merit. Sambo and Pa∣trick, are characters calculated to irritate the risible muscles; they were happily conceived, and sup∣ported with tolerable point and humour.

<P>On friday evening, a first representation was given of the new comedy of the <HI>Triumphs of Love,</HI> written by an American citizen. The writer has
<PB N="xvi" REF="038011_0015_100FB9074F2D6040"/>
endeavoured to expose the folly of too much re∣straint in the education of youth, and the impro∣priety of a practice among the religious society cal∣led Friends, to discourage alliances between their children and those without the pale of their church. In this comedy are interwoven sentiments that do honour to the writer's heart, both as a man and as a citizen, on several interesting topics, such as ne∣gro slavery, and our glorious revolution. The lan∣guage throughout the piece, is pure and appropri∣ate, but the plot wants interest and incident,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The most interesting and incidental parts of the piece were expunged by the managers, unknown to the Author.</NOTE> the sentiments are also rather trite. It shews the wri∣ter a man of feeling, and some observation, but who wants that knowledge of the stage, necessary to suc∣ceed in dramatic composition. The <HI>Triumphs of Love</HI> has much of nature in it, but it is plain, sober nature, without that point required to command the attention and interest the feelings, and that relief necessary for stage effect. The audience received it with their wonted indulgence, and applauded it much throughout.</P>

Prefer Miss S. it is true she is a mad-cap, but a few years of matrimony will cool her, but as for the other, with all her fortune, she will be a bad bargain, she will lead you a hell of a life, she is the damndest vixen that ever was born, but by the by, I shall venture upon her, I have her at my option, as you observe, the great fortune is a great object, I shall have a devil of a job to tame the

<P>My dear Vainly, I am to acknowledge your's of the present day, you say you are engaged to go to the circus with Miss P. and Miss S. that you are in an un∣fortunate predicament with those two ladies, that you have reason to believe they are both in love with you, that you have a partiality for Miss S. but the great fortune of Miss P. is an object, and that you want my advice: I'll give it you. Pre∣fer Miss S. it is true she is a mad-cap, but a few years of matrimony will cool her, but as for the other, with all her fortune, she will be a bad bar∣gain, she will lead you a hell of a life, she is the damndest vixen that ever was born, but by the by, I shall venture upon her, I have her at my option, as you observe, the great fortune is a great object, I shall have a devil of a job to tame the shrew, but I'll make her say, before I have done with her, that the moon is a pancake.</P>
