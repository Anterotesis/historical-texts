<P>When <HI>Moses</HI> returned from the Mount, unto this Idolatrous People, this was One of the awful Demands, which he brought from Heaven unto them; <HI>Therefore now Put off thy Ornament from thee.</HI> The Chaldee reads it; <HI>Put off thy Armour.</HI> And, if it be so read, it seems the Language of a Provoked General, Ordering the <HI>Rebellious Legions</HI>▪ to be <HI>Dis∣armed,</HI> that so he may proceed unto what Punishment he please upon them. Or, if we rather say, <HI>Put off thy Ornaments,</HI> it looks like a Master Ordering a <HI>Slave</HI> to be Stript, that he may then Resolve, Whether to Punish him or no, according to his Demerits. It administers occasion, by the way, to let fall an Admonition concerning a Fault which is too common among us; On our Dayes of HUMILIATION many of our People ap∣pear with too gay <HI>Ornaments</HI> upon them. If <HI>Sack cloth</HI> of old, (the same with <HI>Sagum,</HI>) a <HI>Black rough Garment</HI> made of <HI>coarse</HI> Wooll, (called, <HI>The Garment of Sorrow</HI>) was thought the only <HI>Suitable Habit</HI> for such Dayes, I would bespeak your Plainest, Meannest, Humblest Habit for them. When such Dayes arrive; Christians, Don't Affront Heaven with any <HI>Bravery,</HI> but, <HI>Put off your Ornaments.</HI> What I have now to Observe is this. <HI>To Put off their Ornaments,</HI> is here

Enjoyned upon the People, as an Expression of <HI>Repentance.</HI> There is a <HI>Confession</HI> im∣plied in this Expression. The <HI>Confession</HI> is of this importance; <HI>Lord, We have Stript our selves of all real Ornaments; No real Ornaments do now belong unto us.</HI> They were to <HI>Put off their Ornaments,</HI> in token of what they now Saw and Own'd themselves to be Really be∣fore the Lord; A Ragged, Squalid, Horrid Spectacle! They were to own it, and they did so, with a Wonderful contrition before the Lord.</P>
<P>I lay hold on this Intention. There is a Doctrine, which I may very <HI>Properly</HI> incul∣cate on my Children; Oh! That I may do it as <HI>Pungently</HI>; and very Profitably!</P>
<L>Sinful Men, do by their Sins, Miserably</L>
<L>Strip themselves of Ornaments.</L>
<P>They that are in ill Terms with Heaven, by being yet in their <HI>Sins,</HI> have cause to ap∣prehend themselves really and utterly desti∣tute of all Real <HI>Ornaments.</HI> A Sinner, however he may be adorned▪ Spoils, and Wounds, and Loses all his <HI>Ornaments.</HI> Ah, Sinner, <HI>Put off thy Ornaments.</HI> Do not pretend to be an Owner of any <HI>Orna∣ments</HI>! I have these things to say upon it.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Ʋngodly People</HI> may have those things, which may be Esteemed <HI>Ornaments.</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="001314_0003_0FB276E08C94F280"/>
Many choice <HI>Endowments</HI> &amp; <HI>Ornaments</HI> may be bestow'd upon <HI>Ʋngodly People.</HI> There are Per∣sons, whose <HI>Names</HI> God has not <HI>Written in the Book of Life</HI>: Persons, whom God has <HI>rejected</HI> from His Eternal Purposes of Mercy; Persons, that continue in a State of <HI>Enmity</HI> to God; And yet, the Great GOD, <HI>Adorns</HI> these Per∣sons, with many and lovely <HI>Ornaments.</HI> They that are <HI>Loathsome</HI> to God; the Peo∣ple of whom the word of God assures us, <HI>The Lord Abhors them.</HI> Yet God may bestow those <HI>Ornaments</HI> on these People, which may mightily Set them off in the Eyes of the World. The <HI>Image</HI> of God, wholly does consist of <HI>Ornaments.</HI> There may be seen <HI>Remainders</HI> of the <HI>Image of GOD,</HI> in un∣godly People. Those in whom the <HI>Image of GOD</HI> is not <HI>Restored</HI> by a Saving Work of Heaven upon them, Yet have something of it <HI>Remaining</HI> in them. There was one shut out from the <HI>Kingdom of God</HI>; One who <HI>Lack∣ed that <HI>One thing</HI>,</HI> which is the <HI>Chief Orna∣ment</HI> of all: Yet such were his <HI>Ornaments,</HI> that we read; Mark 10.21. <HI>Jesus beholding him, Loved him.</HI></P>
<P>There may be <HI>Internal Ornaments,</HI> up∣on those, who yet upon other accounts are <HI>within full of all Hypocrisy and Iniquity. Inter∣nal Ornaments</HI> are the <HI>Gifts</HI> of the Holy Spi∣rit of God. There are <HI>Common Gifts</HI> of the Holy Spirit, granted unto <HI>Reprobates:</HI> They are not the <HI>Better things which accompany Sal∣vation.</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="001314_0004_0FB276E210085AD8"/>
We read concerning a Wicked man, 1 Sam. 10.9, 10. <HI>God gave him another Heart; the Spirit of God came upon him.</HI> Rare <HI>Ta∣lents</HI> may be Conferred on Persons who are <HI>Haters of God,</HI> and whom God <HI>Hates,</HI> as the <HI>Workers of Iniquity.</HI></P>
<P>And there may be many <HI>External Or∣naments</HI> Enjoy'd by them, who have no∣thing but what is meerly <HI>External</HI> to boast of. The <HI>Providence</HI> of God may <HI>Enrich</HI> those, who are <HI>Internally</HI> very <HI>Poor Creatures.</HI> It may <HI>Advance</HI> those, who are <HI>Internally</HI> the <HI>Basest of Men.</HI> It may give a <HI>Fair Skin,</HI> a <HI>Speckled Coat,</HI> unto those who are <HI>Internally</HI> full of <HI>Deadly Poison.</HI> We read concerning the most Unhappy Fools; Psal. 49 14 They have <HI>a Beauty, that shall Consume in the Grave.</HI></P>
<P>In the world before the Flood, we read of <HI>Two</HI> Generations. There were the Children of <HI>Cain,</HI> &amp; there were the Children of <HI>Seth.</HI> Among the <HI>Cainites,</HI> we read of Notable <HI>Artists</HI>; We read of them that Built and Own'd whole <HI>Cities</HI>; we read of <HI>Women</HI> that were very Beautiful. Among the <HI>Sethites,</HI> we read not of such things; but we read of Men <HI>Walking with God,</HI> and then <HI>Taken</HI> by Him. The Ancient Writers of <HI>Primitive Christianity</HI> make an Illustrious <HI>Type</HI> of this matter. The <HI>Cainites</HI> are a <HI>Type</HI> of the Men of this World, or▪ of the Kingdom of Satan in this World. The <HI>Sethites</HI> are a <HI>Type</HI> of the Godly, who are called out of this World, into the King∣dom
<PB N="7" REF="001314_0005_0FB276E80D992BB0"/>
of God. Even among the <HI>Cainites,</HI> there may be Great <HI>Hero</HI>'s, there may be Great <HI>Scholars,</HI> there may be Wealthy <HI>Landlords</HI>; and there may be those who may have all the Charms of <HI>Nature</HI> upon them.</P>
<P>There is the Unaccountable <HI>Sovereignty</HI> of GOD, in Ordering of it. All the Children of men must Confess unto the Lord, Isa. 64.8. <HI>O Lord, We are the Clay, and thou art our Potter.</HI> The <HI>Sovereign</HI> Maker of men, may set off His <HI>Clay Vessels</HI> with whatever <HI>Or∣naments</HI> He pleases. The <HI>Vessels,</HI> which He will at last make <HI>Vessels of Wrath,</HI> He may now set them off with very <HI>Fine Figures,</HI> &amp; fill them with what may give a grateful En∣tertainment. It is even so; <HI>Lord of Heaven and Earth, Because it pleases thee!</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Compassion</HI> of Heaven also does Con∣sult the Welfare of <HI>Humane Society</HI> in thus Ordering of it. The Compassionate Lord, has a mighty Tenderness for <HI>Humane Society.</HI> The <HI>Ornaments</HI> of Ungodly Men, are made unspeakably Serviceable, incredibly Beneficial, to <HI>Humane Society.</HI> The <HI>World,</HI> yea, and the <HI>Church</HI> of God in the world, fares the better, for the <HI>Ornaments</HI> of Un∣godly People. God makes a <HI>Good Ʋse</HI> of <HI>Ill People.</HI> He furnishes <HI>Ill People</HI> with abun∣dance of <HI>Good,</HI> because He will Employ them to <HI>Do</HI> abundance of <HI>Good.</HI> He Lodges <HI>Good Qualities,</HI> and Brave, and Neat <HI>Ornaments</HI> in <HI>Bad People,</HI> because He will make use of
<PB N="8" REF="001314_0006_0FB276EEE4963600"/>
them for the <HI>Good</HI> of others. Oh! The Good∣ness of God! <HI>How Great is His Goodness and His Beauty!</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. There is a Wondrous, an Hideous, <HI>Ʋgliness</HI> in all Ungodly People, notwith∣standing all their Esteemed <HI>Ornaments.</HI> Hear this O Proud and Vain and Self-ap∣plauding Sinner: There is not one <HI>Ʋngodly</HI> Sinner, but what is a Prodigy of <HI>Deformity. Abominable Men,</HI> who <HI>Drink in Iniquity like Water</HI>! The Person who for many Ages was the Greatest Person in <HI>Europe,</HI> is called, Dan. 11.21. <HI>A Vile Person.</HI> Why? He is the <HI>Man of Sin. <HI>Sin, Sin</HI>,</HI> always makes a <HI>Vile Per∣son</HI>▪ [Compare, Psal. 15.4] We read, — and Oh! What Pumice stones are our Eyes, that we can read it with <HI>Dry Eyes</HI>! Psal. 14.1, 3. <HI>They are Corrupt, they have done abomina∣ble Works, they are all together become Filthy.</HI> Tis the Description of all Ungodly People. <HI>Hear this, O all ye People, every one of You.</HI></P>
<P>We read of an <HI>Adorned Sepulchre.</HI> What is an <HI>Adorned Sinner</HI> but an <HI>Adorned Sepulchre</HI>? Let never such <HI>Ornaments</HI> appear upon him▪ he is a Collection of Loathsom <HI>Filthi∣ness</HI> and <HI>Rottenness</HI> Come with me, Mise∣rable Wretch: Come along with me; and I will show thee what thou art. The <HI>Word</HI> of God is Compared unto a <HI>Glass.</HI> Thou shalt be showen unto thy self in that <HI>Glass.</HI> Oh! Be not that <HI>Forgetful Hearer,</HI> that will <HI>go a∣way,
<PB N="9" REF="001314_0007_0FB276F152BB70D0"/>
and Straight-way forget</HI> what manner of thing thou art. Look into the <HI>Third Chap∣ter</HI> to the <HI>Romans,</HI> and Read, from the <HI>Twelfth</HI> Verse to the <HI>Eighteenth.</HI> Read, and <HI>be Con∣founded, and never open thy Mouth any more, because of thy Shame.</HI> [Turn to the Place, and Read it with Deliberation.]</P>
<P><HI>Original Sin,</HI> Our <HI>Original Sin</HI> has brought us under an <HI>Ʋniversal Depravation</HI>▪ it has depraved us with an <HI>Ʋniversal Defor∣mity.</HI> By losing the <HI>Image</HI> of GOD, we have Lost our <HI>Ornaments.</HI> By having the <HI>Sa∣tanick Image</HI> upon us, which are made most <HI>horrible Objects.</HI> — But I anticipate my self; My Discourse is yet but coming to that Ex∣tremity.</P>
<P>I must first say; To be born a <HI>Sinner,</HI> is to be born a <HI>Monster.</HI> Tis as Odious, as Frightful, as to be born with the Scales of the <HI>Leviathan</HI>; to be born with the <HI>Belly</HI> where the <HI>Head</HI> should be; with <HI>Eyes</HI> in the Back-part of the Head; with the <HI>Hands</HI> growing to the Mouth; with the <HI>Feet</HI> made for ever to go awry every Step. I Speak Significantly; Sinner, such, even such a <HI>Monster</HI> would be thy very <HI>Em∣blem.</HI> There is no Sinner, but from his very <HI>Birth,</HI> every thing is <HI>Out of Order</HI> with him.</P>
<P>Is not an <HI>Hater of God,</HI> an <HI>horrible Object</HI>? No Good Man can without Horror think of such an Object. But such an one is every Unrenewed Sinner, every Unrepenting Sin∣ner. We read, Rom. 1.30. They are
<PB N="10" REF="001314_0008_0FB276F357ED7148"/>
<HI>Haters of God.</HI> Vile Things are to be spoken of thee, O Thou <HI>Hater of God,</HI> thou <HI>Monster</HI> of the World!</P>
<P>We generally decry a man, who <HI>Loves none but himself.</HI> A Sinner not changed by Grace, comes under this Character. He sets up <HI>himself</HI> at his GOD. He does nothing but for <HI>himself. Self, Self</HI> lies at the bottom of all his <HI>Designs,</HI> all his <HI>Actions,</HI> all his <HI>Friend∣ship.</HI></P>
<P>We generally decry a man who is <HI>Ingrate∣ful</HI> to his Benefactor. This is the Black Character of a Sinner, whom Grace has not made a change upon. His <HI>Ingratitude</HI> unto GOD, who <HI>Keeps</HI> him, who <HI>Feeds</HI> him, who, <HI>daily Loads him with his Benefits,</HI> tis the most abominable Thing that ever was heard of. He is alwayes <HI>Reproaching the Lord,</HI> whom every Moment he lives upon.</P>
<P>How <HI>Deformed</HI> were a <HI>Man</HI> turn'd into a <HI>Dog,</HI> a <HI>Swine,</HI> a <HI>Serpent!</HI> So is the Unrenewed Sinner Painted in the Book of God! A Creature full of <HI>Ornaments</HI> indeed! <HI>Born a Wild Asses Colt!</HI> A curious Creature truly▪</P>
<P>But I must at last bring the matter to the Extremity. Certainly▪ a <HI>Devil</HI> is an ugly Thing▪ The <HI>Image</HI> of the <HI>Devil</HI> is all over <HI>Ʋgly.</HI> Sinner, Tis thy <HI>Image.</HI> The word of God has called such as thou art; 1 Joh. 3.10. <HI>The Children of the Devil.</HI> Oh! horrible De∣formity!</P>
<P>In fine; How do all ungodly People ap∣pear
<PB N="11" REF="001314_0009_0FB276F581ADDAF8"/>
to all the <HI>Angels</HI> in Heaven? Verily, Those Holy <HI>Angels</HI> look upon the Unrenew∣ed Sinner, with Astonishment, with Detesta∣tion; they look upon him as you do upon a <HI>Toad.</HI> An <HI>Ʋngodly World</HI> is that rueful and hateful Sight, at which the <HI>Angels</HI> of Heaven are thus call'd upon; Jer. 2.12. <HI>Be astonished, O ye Heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye very desolate, saith the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. The <HI>Ornaments</HI> on <HI>Ʋngodly</HI> People, the very <HI>Ornaments</HI> themselves, thro' their <HI>Ʋngodliness,</HI> do even cease to be <HI>Ornaments</HI>▪ As we read; Rom. 2.25. <HI>If thou be a breaker of the Law, thy Circumcision is made Ʋncircum∣cision.</HI> Even so, If thou art an ungodly Per∣son, thy <HI>Ornaments are made no Ornaments.</HI> Ah, Unregenerate and Unreconciled Sinner▪ whatever may be thy pretended <HI>Ornaments</HI>; E'en make no pretensions to any <HI>Orna∣ments</HI>; thy Sins, thy Sins, have ruined all thy <HI>Ornaments.</HI> It was a sore Ballance to the <HI>Ornaments</HI> of <HI>Naaman</HI>; 2 King▪ 5.1. <HI>He was an honourable man; he was also a migh∣ty man in Valour; but he was a Leper.</HI> But all the <HI>Ornaments</HI> of any Person, are much more heavily over-ballanced, if there be this Dead Weight on the other side; <HI>But <HI>he is a Sinner</HI>; But <HI>he has no Fear of God:</HI> But <HI>he is a Stranger to Serious Piety</HI>; But <HI>he is destitute of that Holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord.</HI></HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="001314_0010_0FB276F648B7B850"/>We will Enumerate the <HI>Principal <HI>Orna∣ments</HI>,</HI> that are found on any <HI>Ʋngodly</HI> Peo∣ple, and see how they are <HI>Eclips'd, Absorb'd,</HI> even <HI>Destroy'd</HI> by their <HI>Ʋngodliness.</HI></P>
<P>First. Some are <HI>Adorned</HI> with <HI>Wit,</HI> with <HI>Knowledge,</HI> with <HI>Learning</HI>; Their <HI>Natu∣ral Abilities</HI> are very Pregnant; Their <HI>Acqui∣red Abilities</HI> are very shining. They have Sharp <HI>Ʋnderstandings,</HI> Quick <HI>Inventions,</HI> Strong <HI>Memories.</HI> These are admirable <HI>Orna∣ments.</HI> These <HI>Ornaments</HI> may be found in some that yet are not <HI>Wise unto Salvation.</HI> But, Ah, Witty Sinner; What will become of thy <HI>Wit,</HI> when in thy <HI>Later End</HI> thou shalt be found a <HI>Fool,</HI> and thou wilt call thy self a <HI>Fool</HI> World without End? Count not thy self a <HI>Wise Man.</HI> Thou art One of those, of whom the Oracles of Wisdom declare, <HI>There is no Wisdom in them.</HI> An Unconverted Sin∣ner is a <HI>Fool.</HI> He does nothing, but what calls for that Acknowledgment; 2 Sam. 24.<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0. <HI>I have done very foolishly.</HI> The whole course of a Sinner is, <HI>To go astray in the great∣ness of his Folly.</HI> What <HI>Wisdom</HI> is there in a Sinner? There is not yet in him so much as the <HI>Beginning of Wisdom.</HI> Until a man has the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> he has not the <HI>Beginning of Wisdom.</HI> What Signify the brightest Ac∣complishments &amp; Embellishments of Mind, in that Man, who is all the while a <HI>Mad-man</HI>? He that is not a <HI>Good Man</HI> is a <HI>Mad-man.</HI> We read, Eccl. 9.3. <HI>Madness is in their hearts.</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="001314_0011_0FB276F9C5606B48"/>
Ah, Foolish Sinner! He has the <HI>Wit</HI> to do &amp; Speak ingenious things without Number: But he has not the <HI>Wit,</HI> to Encounter the <HI>De∣vices of Satan</HI> against him. He may be a <HI>Knowing</HI> Person; But he <HI>Knows not</HI> the Things <HI>of his Everlasting Peace.</HI> He may be a <HI>Learn∣ed</HI> Person; But he has not <HI>Learn't</HI> the skill of <HI>Living unto God.</HI> He may be reckon'd a <HI>Wise Man</HI>; but he never did <HI>One Wise Act</HI> in all his Life. A <HI>Wise Man</HI>! Alas, he is a <HI>Mad∣man</HI>! He Sells a <HI>Soul</HI> for a <HI>Song.</HI> He parts with <HI>Eternal Pleasures,</HI> for some Shadow of a <HI>Delight,</HI> which Expires in a <HI>Moment.</HI> He con∣tends with an <HI>Almighty</HI> GOD, who can crush him in a Moment! Fool, <HI>Put off thy Or∣naments.</HI> A <HI>Fools Coat</HI> belongs unto thee.</P>
<P>Secondly: Some are <HI>Adorned</HI> with a <HI>Sweet∣ness of Temper</HI> They are so Good-natu∣red, so Good-humoured, so Obliging, that they may be styled, as One was, <HI>Delicium humani generis</HI>; The <HI>Delight</HI> of all that Converse with them. A Courteous▪ Officious, Condescend∣ing Temper, is an <HI>Ornament,</HI> which every body commends. It commands Commenda∣tion, Every bodies Commendation. But, Oh, Sweet tempered Child; If thou art yet in thy Sins, the greatest <HI>Baseness of Temper</HI> in the World, is to be charg'd upon thee. A Glo∣rious CHRIST has dyed for thee; has En∣treated thee, Requested thee, Importuned thee, long waited on thee, to become <HI>His.</HI> Thou takest no notice of Him. Nothing
<PB N="14" REF="001314_0012_0FB276FBA4F99F38"/>
will win upon thee. A Dying Saviour will not win upon thee. Base-tempered Wretch; All Heaven cryes out upon thee. Thou art an <HI>Enemy</HI> to GOD; That is to be an <HI>Enemy</HI> to Infinite <HI>Goodness.</HI> Is this the <HI>Goodness</HI> of thy <HI>Temper?</HI> To Abuse <HI>Goodness</HI> it self! Thou art a most <HI>Ʋnthankful</HI> Creature. The Complaint which the Blessed GOD makes over thee, is that; Isa. 1.2 <HI>I have nou∣rished, and brought up Children and they have Re∣belled against me.</HI> The Blessed GOD even courts thee, with His Blessings. Thy Heart beats not so many <HI>Pulses,</HI> as a Good GOD heaps Blessings of Goodness upon thee. All these Kindnesses will not perswade thee to Love Him. After all these Kindnesses, thou dost continue in Arms against Him. Verily, Every Person in a <HI>State of Nature,</HI> is a very <HI>ill-natured</HI> Person. Hard-hearted Sinner; <HI>Put off thy Ornaments.</HI> Dost thou <HI>thus Requite the Lord?</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. Some are <HI>Adorned</HI> with a Noble <HI>Courage</HI> and <HI>Valour</HI>; a Courageous, Vali∣ant, Undaunted <HI>Magnanimity.</HI> They are, as it was said about certain Men of <HI>Moab; Lion-like Men.</HI> They are men of <HI>Resolution.</HI> They Enjoy a <HI>Presence of Mind</HI> among Showers of Bullets; amidst the Thunder of the Armies and their Shouting, as well as in their Closets. This is a very Sparkling <HI>Ornament.</HI> But if this <HI>Resolute</HI> Man be one that is not <HI>Resolved</HI> for the Service of GOD, he is a <HI>Coward.</HI> We
<PB N="15" REF="001314_0013_0FB2770073BFE108"/>
read, who Leads the <HI>Van,</HI> in the <HI>Host,</HI> of them that are the <HI>Children of Perdition</HI>; Rev. 21.8. <HI>The Fearful. Fool-hardy</HI> Sinner; He is found a <HI>Fighter against GOD. Faint-hearted</HI> Sinner; He is <HI>Afraid</HI> of Engaging in the Strict wayes of Religion; He is <HI>Afraid</HI> of coming under Obligations to cross his Fleshly Inclinations. He is <HI>Afraid</HI> of Suffering a little <HI>Persecution,</HI> a little <HI>Disadvantage,</HI> perhaps a little <HI>Derision,</HI> for the Cause of GOD. Coward, <HI>Put off thy Ornaments,</HI> Thou art <HI>Afraid of a Shadow</HI>▪</P>
<P>Fourthly. Some are <HI>Adorned</HI> with <HI>Good Breeding</HI>; They have been <HI>Well-bred</HI>; have had a <HI>Polite Education.</HI> They have a Civil, a Decent, in one Word, which comprehends <HI>all the Rules of Behaviour,</HI> A MODEST Be∣haviour; They Behave themselves Hand∣somely, that is to say, <HI>Modestly,</HI> on all occa∣sions. A very taking <HI>Ornament</HI>! An Handsome Carriage. But what becomes of the <HI>Good Manners,</HI> where the People do no∣thing but <HI>Miscarry</HI> every day? They whose <HI>Manner</HI> it is, to do nothing but <HI>Sin,</HI> are guilty of <HI>Ill-Manners.</HI> The <HI>Manners</HI> of all Impious People, are the worst of <HI>Manners.</HI> They <HI>Corrupt Good Manners</HI>; they <HI>Cast off Good Manners,</HI> and the thing that is <HI>Good.</HI> It may be said unto them; Jer. 22 21. <HI>This hath been thy manner from thy Youth, that thou Obeyed not my Voice.</HI> Ah, <HI>Ill bred</HI> Sinner! A Sinner that Misbehaves himself in every <HI>Business</HI>; in every <HI>Company.</HI> A Sinner that goes about
<PB N="16" REF="001314_0014_0FB2770458C2D248"/>
every Good Thing, with a very <HI>Misbecoming</HI> Awkwardness. Oh! Thou <HI>Accustomed to do Evil; <HI>Put off thy Ornaments.</HI></HI> Thou dost nothing <HI>Right</HI>!</P>
<P>Fifthly. There are Some <HI>Adorned</HI> with <HI>Riches</HI> in Abundance; <HI>Riches,</HI> which the Sons of <HI>Laban</HI> count their <HI>Glory.</HI> They have <HI>Silver</HI> and <HI>Gold</HI> enough to make them <HI>Glitter.</HI> They have <HI>Wealth</HI> enough to dazzle the Eyes of the Beholders. <HI>Riches</HI> are commonly E∣steemed <HI>Ornaments.</HI> Men Esteem them∣selves for them; Expect Esteem from others; Reckon themselves <HI>Endowed</HI> with them. To little Purpose, if they are not <HI>Rich towards God.</HI> A <HI>Wealthy</HI> man, if he be a <HI>Wicked</HI> man, he is worth <HI>nothing.</HI> A <HI>Rich</HI> man, that has made no Provision for <HI>Eternity,</HI> may under∣go a <HI>Laodicean</HI> Rebuke; Rev. 3.17. <HI>Thou sayest, I am Rich; &amp; knowest not, that thou art Wretched &amp; Miserable, and Poor, and Blind, and Naked.</HI> We may, unto such a Sinner, Invert the Words to the Angel of <HI>Smyrna; I know thy Riches, but thou art Poor.</HI> A <HI>Lazarus</HI> is <HI>Richer</HI> than the <HI>Richest</HI> Sinner in the World: A <HI>Rich Man,</HI> but a <HI>Rich Fool</HI>! A <HI>Rich Man,</HI> but one that has a <HI>Poor,</HI> Needy, Starving Soul within him; A <HI>Rich Man,</HI> but One that may <HI>Dy this Night,</HI> and leave all, and he has laid up nothing for Eternity! Such a <HI>Craesus</HI> is but a Wretched <HI>Beggar.</HI> The Emperour <HI>Basilius</HI> with his two hundred thousand Ta∣lents of <HI>Gold,</HI> (according to <HI>Zonaras,</HI> which
<PB N="17" REF="001314_0015_0FB2770749E20780"/>
<HI>Lipsius</HI> computes, at a thousand and two hundred Millions of Money) besides Num∣berless Heaps of <HI>Silver,</HI> and numerous chests of <HI>Jewels</HI>; while he was a <HI>Wicked Man,</HI> a <HI>Wise</HI> One has told us, He was <HI>Little Worth. Thou Fool, <HI>Put off thy Ornaments.</HI></HI> Thy <HI>Poor, Poor, Poor</HI> Soul, is a <HI>Prisoner in a Dungeon</HI>!</P>
<P>Sixthly. There are Some <HI>Adorned</HI> with <HI>Honourable Relations</HI>; They are well <HI>Related</HI>; They have <HI>Relatives</HI> of some Account. They are of <HI>Credible Families.</HI> Their <HI>Ancestors</HI> were Persons of Renown. They are Allied unto Persons of Con∣siderable Interest. Such <HI>Escutcheons</HI> are <HI>Ornaments.</HI> But▪ my Friend; There is a desperate <HI>Blot</HI> in them, if thou art not a <HI>Child of God.</HI> It was a sad Word, Spoken to Some, that boasted what <HI>Family</HI> they were of; Joh. 8 44 <HI>Ye are of your Father the Devil.</HI> What Signifies a Mans being of a <HI>Good House</HI>; if he belong to <HI>the House of the Wicked</HI>! What Signifies the <HI>Generation</HI> a man is of, if he be One of <HI>the Generation of the Wrath of GOD</HI>? If thy Progenitors have been Eminent Per∣sons, their <HI>Eminency</HI> will be but an Aggrava∣tion of thy <HI>Degeneracy. — At non ille Satum, quo te mentiris.</HI> — A <HI>Sinful Offspring</HI> of some gracious Progenitors, make themselves viler than a <HI>Spurious Offspring.</HI> Silly Trifler; <HI>Put off thy Ornaments.</HI> If <HI>Satan</HI> be thy <HI>Father,</HI> and all the <HI>Slaves of Satan</HI> be thy <HI>Bre∣thren,</HI> tis no matter who else may be thy <HI>Relatives.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="001314_0016_0FB2770A8A424C08"/>Seventhly. There are Some <HI>Adorned</HI> with <HI>Beauty:</HI> They are very <HI>Beautiful</HI>; Their <HI>Complexion,</HI> their <HI>Proportion,</HI> their <HI>Aspect,</HI> is very grateful. All that are not <HI>Blind,</HI> Look upon this as an <HI>Ornament.</HI> But I remem∣ber a most humbling Word; Prov. 11.22. <HI>As a Jewel of Gold in a Swines Snout, so is a fair Woman without Discretion.</HI> An <HI>Adorned Swine!</HI> What an <HI>Ʋncouth Sight</HI> is That? They that are not yet <HI>Renewed in the Spirit of their Mind,</HI> alas, they have Sinned away all their <HI>Beauty.</HI> Every thing is <HI>Irregular</HI> in them. Their <HI>Eyes</HI> are closed with <HI>Filthy Hu∣mours.</HI> They are so <HI>Lame,</HI> that they take none but <HI>Wrong Steps</HI>; they are ever <HI>Stum∣bling.</HI> They have a nasty <HI>Leprosy</HI> on them; from the <HI>Crown of the Head to the Sole of the Foot, nothing but Wounds, and Bruises, and Pu∣trifying Sores▪ Crookedness</HI> is Look'd on as an <HI>Ʋnshapeliness.</HI> Many a <HI>Crooked</HI> Person, is highly to be valued, for being among the <HI>Ʋpright in Heart.</HI> But a <HI>Well shaped Body</HI> will not cover thy Disgrace, Child, if thou art One of the <HI>Crooked, and Perverse Nation. Stammering,</HI> tis a very abasing Imperfection; a very uneasy Infirmity. Our Saviour <HI>Sigh'd,</HI> when he saw a man Troubled with it. A Learned Man has Written a Discourse to prove, That it was the Great Apostles, <HI>Thorn in the Flesh</HI> But the Sinner, who does not <HI>Keep his Tongue from Evil,</HI> is much worse than any <HI>Stammerer.</HI> Uncomely Sinner; <HI>Put
<PB N="19" REF="001314_0017_0FB2770C09D10BD8"/>
off thy Ornaments</HI>; Thy <HI>Sin</HI> puts all out of <HI>Shape.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly; I leave to the <HI>Last</HI> of all, that which is truly to all Judicious People the <HI>Least</HI> of all; There are Some <HI>Adorned</HI> with <HI>Splen∣did Apparrel.</HI> Their <HI>Garments</HI> are their <HI>Ornaments.</HI> The <HI>Meanest</HI> of all <HI>Orna∣ments</HI> are perhaps their <HI>Only <HI>Ornaments.</HI></HI> Perhaps they count some things to be <HI>Or∣naments,</HI> which the Sober and the Vertuous in all Ages have decried, as not being the <HI>Spots of the Children of God.</HI> Particularly, The <HI>Spots</HI> which disfigure the Faces of so many Gentlewomen in our Days, have in all former Ages been decried by all Pious Per∣sons, as <HI>Blemishes,</HI> and <HI>Vanities,</HI> altogether misbecoming the <HI>Children of God</HI>: altogether improper for <HI>Baptised Faces</HI>! Children, Wash them off, with the <HI>Tears</HI> of true Devotion. Those <HI>Tears</HI> would certainly do it. Per∣haps the <HI>Costly Rigging</HI> of some at one time upon them, is more than they have laid out for the <HI>Special Service of God,</HI> in many years together. Alas, what is the Lady <HI>Bernice,</HI> in her <HI>Great Pomp,</HI> with all her <HI>Jewels</HI> upon her? A meer <HI>Shining</HI> piece of <HI>Rottenness.</HI> But the Word of God has told you of <HI>Better Ornaments</HI>; 1 Pet. 3 4, <HI>The Ornaments of the Interiour, — the Spirit; which are of great price in the Sight of God.</HI> Children, If you are without those <HI>Ornaments,</HI> You are as bad as without all <HI>Ornaments.</HI> While you are
<PB N="20" REF="001314_0018_0FB2771256720C48"/>
<HI>in your Sins,</HI> You are clothed with <HI>Filthy Rags.</HI> Till you have <HI>Put on the Lord</HI> JESUS CHRIST, you are without the only <HI>Gar∣ments</HI> that can Commend you to Heaven, or Defend you from the Wrath of Heaven. Art thou not yet <HI>Cloathed</HI> with the <HI>Righteous∣ness</HI> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST? Sinner, <HI>Put off thy Ornaments.</HI> Thy Soul is <HI>Na∣ked,</HI> is <HI>Forlorn,</HI> has nothing upon it, but what proclames thee Miserable.</P>

<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>AND now, <HI>Hear the Conclusion of the Mat∣ter.</HI> My Children, Be prevailed withal to Seek the <HI>Best Ornaments</HI>; The <HI>Orna∣ments</HI> without which, you Forfeit, and Con∣found, and Blemish, and for ever Nullify all your other <HI>Ornaments.</HI></P>
<P>My Hearers, Will you mind what I say?</P>
<P>I say, First; That you must not value your selves on any <HI>Pretended <HI>Ornaments</HI>,</HI> while you are <HI>Yet in your Sins.</HI> No; See your selves; Loathe your selves; Be not Angry if <HI>Others</HI> cast much <HI>Contempt</HI> upon you. Make those <HI>Lamentations</HI>; Lam. 5 16. <HI>The Crown is fallen from our Head, wo unto us that we have Sinned.</HI> Retire, Ponder, Fall into Heart-breaking Soliloquies;
<Q><HI>Lord, what am I</HI>? Nothing but a Lump of <HI>Deformity</HI>; No∣thing but an heap of <HI>Abomination</HI>!</Q></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="001314_0019_0FB277138BC07410"/>I say, Secondly: That if you make but a little Show of <HI>Other <HI>Ornaments</HI>,</HI> yet <HI>Seri∣ous Piety</HI> will make you Incomparable Crea∣tures. <HI>Holiness,</HI> t'will make you the <HI>Excellent of the Earth.</HI> So we are taught; Prov. 12.26. <HI>The Righteous is more Excellent than his Neighbour.</HI> Suppose a Person to be of the <HI>Common Rank,</HI> of no Secular Advantages; but One that betimes turns to God; an Ex∣ample of <HI>Early Religion</HI>; One Devout, Watch∣ful, Prayerful; <HI>Ready to every Good Work</HI>; One Humble, Honest, Industrious; full of all Goodness, and Kindness to all about him. Truly, the <HI>Ornaments</HI> of such an One, will bespeak an uncommon Respect for him a∣mong the People of God. Verily, Such Persons are themselves the <HI>Ornaments</HI> of the Societies whereto they belong; They are, (as a Good Man was once called, <HI>Monile Ecclesiae</HI>) the <HI>Jewels</HI> of the Church; they are the <HI>Stars</HI> of the World.</P>
<P>I say, Lastly. Then, <HI>Children,</HI> make your <HI>Choice.</HI> We read, Psal. 45.13. Of, <HI>A Kings Daughter all glorious within.</HI> The <HI>Ornaments</HI> which will render you <HI>all glorious Within</HI>; Oh! make <HI>Choice</HI> of these; your Choice of them will render you the <HI>Adorned</HI> Children of God. Let the <HI>Ornaments</HI> that you will Chuse and Seek, be, The <HI>Knowledge</HI> of a Glorious CHRIST: A <HI>Resemblance</HI> to that Glorious Lord; An <HI>Obedience</HI> to that
<PB N="22" REF="001314_0020_0FB277170B6C7810"/>
Glorious Lord; A <HI>Patience</HI> under all His Mortifying Dispensations; An <HI>Abhorrence</HI> of all <HI>Sin</HI> against Him; A <HI>Disposition to <HI>Do Good</HI>,</HI> and Know no <HI>Pleasure</HI> equal to <HI>That.</HI> You are called upon; Phil 4.8. <HI>Whatsoever Things are Lovely! Think on these things.</HI> Children, These things are <HI>Lovely,</HI> and will make you <HI>Lovely.</HI> Go to the Glorious LORD for such <HI>Ornaments.</HI> Ask them of Him, who gives them <HI>Liberally,</HI> to them that ask them. Ask His <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> which He <HI>Gives to them that ask Him,</HI> and then you have them Liberally. Be importunate in your Supplications; <HI>Oh! my God, Let thy Holy Spirit, Possess me, Renew me, Incline me, and Adorn me wonderfully.</HI> My Child; The next Smile of Heaven upon thee, will be that; Isa. 60.1. <HI>Arise, and Shine; for thy Light is Come; and the Glory of the Lord is Risen upon thee</HI>: Thy <HI>Ornaments</HI> are <HI>Won∣derful!</HI></P>
