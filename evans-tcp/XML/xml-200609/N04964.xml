<HEAD>PHILADELPHIA, January 2. By Capt. <HI>Gantony,</HI> arrived at <HI>Wilmington</HI> from <HI>St. Eustatia,</HI> we have the following Extracts. A letter from a Gentleman at <HI>Eustatia</HI> to his Friend here, dated
<DATE>De∣cember 1, 1747.</DATE></HEAD>
<Q><P>I Make no Doubt but you have heard, long ere now, of the Suc∣cess of Admiral <HI>Hawke</HI>; who having fell in with a large Fleet of <HI>French</HI> Merchantmen, under Convoy of 9 Men of War of the line [<HI>suppos'd in the Bay of</HI> Biscay] has taken the following Ships, <HI>viz.</HI>
<LIST>
<HEAD>Names. Guns.</HEAD>

</LIST></P>
<P>One Ship of 84 Guns, and another of 74, put back to <HI>France</HI> in a shatter'd Condition.
And,</P>
<P>One 64 Gun Ship and a Frigate, proceeded with 260 Sail of Merchantmen for the West-Indies.</P></Q>
<P>We likewise hear, that Adm. <HI>Hawke</HI> having dispatch'd an Advice-Boat to the <HI>W. Indies,</HI> to inform the Men of War and Privateers there, of his Success in taking the Convoy, in Order that they might be up∣on the Watch to intercept the Merchantmen; and that they according∣ly were out, and have taken several, who are arrived at Antigua.</P>
<P>By a Letter from Capt. <HI>Bowne,</HI> of the Privateer Brigt. <HI>Trembleur,</HI> of this Port, we learn, That on the 1st of <HI>Nov.</HI> last, he fell in with and took a <HI>Spanish</HI> Privateer Sloop, of 6 Carriage Guns, 6 Pounders, 12 Swivels, Blunderbusses, Lances, with other Small-Arms, and 140 Men, after a very obstinate Engagement; the Enemy, when they struck, not having one Sail nor Rope left whole, and their Boom and Bow-sprit shot to Pieces; Capt. Bowne (who had one Man killed in the Engagement, and his Sails and Rigging much damaged) took her in Tow, and carried her into <HI>St. Thomas</HI>; and was, on the Date of his Letter, going in Company with the <HI>Castor</HI> Privateer of <HI>New-York,</HI> off <HI>Martineco,</HI> to wait for a <HI>French</HI> Fleet daily expected there, very probably that mention'd above. Capt. <HI>Bowne</HI> had but 89 Men,</P>
