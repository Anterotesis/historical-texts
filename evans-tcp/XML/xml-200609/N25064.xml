<P>Concuring with the author of the preceding quo∣tation, I am induced to put this my first, and (con∣sequently) darling offspring under your auspices; confident that if cherished by you, it cannot fail of be∣coming popular, since the general opinion in works of this kind will ever be guided by your taste, which unquestionably is the best criterion.</P>

<L>TO night, kind patrons of Columbian taste,</L>
<L>Our drama shines, by native genius grac'd;</L>
<L>A town bred Muse, unschool'd in scenic art,</L>
<L>Contented in her little sphere, the heart;</L>
<L>And scorning all the spurious tricks of show,</L>
<L>The ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rish pageant of dramatic woe;</L>
<L><HI>Domestic</HI> grief's ideal scenes essays;</L>
<L>Yet <HI>truth</HI> may weep, tho' <HI>Fiction's</HI> hand portrays.</L>
<L>IF <HI>Fancy</HI> frolic for the moral weal,</L>
<L>And cheat the senses, that the heart may feel;</L>
<L>If in the mimic life, by genius penn'd,</L>
<L><HI>Vice</HI> lose a charm, and <HI>Virtue</HI> gain a friend;</L>
<L>Each manly bosom will the tale approve,</L>
<L>Tho' guileless beauty mourn disastrous love.</L>
<L>Such are the v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ands, which our bard doth cater;</L>
<L>—He boasts no <HI>steward,</HI> but—"<HI>dear goddess Nature:</HI>"</L>
<L>But not <HI>that Nature,</HI> that cold vestal saint,</L>
<L>That puritanic dame, which poets paint;</L>
<L>Our Author quite a different being forms her,</L>
<L>Inspires with <HI>Virtues,</HI> yet with <HI>Passions</HI> warms her;</L>
<L>Chaste as the hooded nymph, at vespers pale,</L>
<L>Yet not a NUN, for NATURE <HI>wears no veil</HI>!</L>
<L>Right reverend Critics, met in sage divan,</L>

<L>Your <HI>well-s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arch'd</HI> features are the best—to <HI>simper!</HI></L>
<L>Then yield a generous ear;—our drama's cause</L>
<L>In treats indulgence—not demands applause.</L>
<L>And if thro' five grave acts, with many a tear,</L>
<L>Not once you're taken, tripping at a <HI>sneer</HI>;</L>
<L>May fortune, on whose <HI>manna</HI> poets live,</L>
<L>To each kind critic's arms, in justice, give</L>
<L>A <HI>wealthier</HI> mistress, than the <HI>Muse,</HI> for life,</L>
<L>For she is <HI>much too poor,</HI>—to be a WIFE!!</L>
<L>With cordial candor, then, your hearts expand;</L>
<L>The plant of genius needs a nurturing hand.</L>
<L>Its infant germ, if censure's frost be keen,</L>
<L>May droop beneath the <HI>winter</HI> of your spleen;</L>
<L>But, blest by your kind culture, it will bloom,</L>
<L>Each bud a blossom, and each leaf perfume.</L>

<L>[<HI>Love's region</HI> borders on the <HI>realm of wit,</HI>]</L>

<L>And prove that <HI>Beauty,</HI> like the <HI>Sun,</HI> whose ray</L>

<SPEAKER>Danfred.</SPEAKER>
<L>INTESTINE misery each day brings forth,</L>
<L>Disturbing ev'ry avenue to quiet.</L>
<L>Oh do not Albert agitate my thoughts,</L>
<L>On the detested subject of my son;</L>
<L>Whose vile transgression, and abhorr'd neglect</L>
<L>Of the advice his infant years received,</L>
<L>Entitle him to fate's severest rigour.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Alb.</SPEAKER>
<L>Can you then heedlessly behold his grief?</L>
<L>Without compassion count the numerous tears,</L>
<L>Which daily sully the fair, manly cheek</L>
<L>Of spirited Orlando!</L>
<L>Think of his youth;—how warm his heart was fraught</L>
<L>With vehemence of passion, and his mind,</L>
<L>(Turn'd to the beauteous object) so engross'd,</L>
<L>That reason cou'd not have its usual sway.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dan.</SPEAKER>
<L>How hard thou lab'rest to redeem thy friend,</L>
<L>In my esteem, and make me turn towards him;</L>
<L>But 'tis in vain. My heart is fix'd too firm</L>
<L>In lasting hate!—</L>
<L>For shou'd the fairest angel, e'er bless'd man,</L>
<L>Humble herself a prostrate suppliant;</L>
<L>Break forth in all the eloquence, that e'er</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="033216_0008_0FF675C625569BE8"/>Warbled from tender sounds of melting pity,</L>
<L>I'd hear invulnerable, the sorrowing tale,</L>
<L>Unmov'd by soft persuasion, and remain</L>
<L>Deaf to distress, and callous to his woes.</L>

<SPEAKER>Alb.</SPEAKER>
<L>Impossible!</L>
<L>You cou'd not rise superior to the quick,</L>
<L>The tender sense which nature here demands▪</L>
<L>Philosophy herself, wou'd own her weakness,</L>
<L>And childishly irresolute let fall a tear.—</L>
<L>O cou'd a Parent then behold his son,</L>

<L>Once was my soul bent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow'rds him with un∣bounded</L>
<L>Rapture, and admiration!—Then indeed</L>

<L>How can you then so ill repay the gift,</L>

<L>Mistaken man! Those days will ne'er return,</L>
<L>In which my heart was wrapt with such affection.</L>
<L>He was the only object, that my wishes</L>
<L>Sought to enrich; Albert, each sigh, each grief,</L>
<L>Burst but for him, and all the world besides,</L>
<L>Shrunk when compar'd with his superior worth;</L>

<L>Deserted, and forlorn, no friend to help thee;</L>
<L>Did such a situation ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thy rest,</L>
<L>How eager wou'd your duteous son then fly,</L>
<L>To risk his life, and forfeit all to save thee;</L>
<L>Alas, his generous heart expands itself,</L>
<L>Susceptible of every noble virtue.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dan.</SPEAKER>
<L>Dost thou upbraid my heart with being void,</L>
<L>Even of the common sympathy, that lives,</L>
<L>Amidst the lowest reptiles of mankind?</L>
<L>False is the imputation, falser still,</L>
<L>The tongue that dares to utter it.</L>

<L>Nay, cease thine anger Danfred—If you dare</L>
<L>Deny the accusation, shew some proof,</L>
<L>Whose test will contradict my bold assertion;</L>
<L>But while the access to your mercy's shut,</L>

<L>Behold the naked form of wretchedness</L>
<L>Without a single sigh;—See thy son droop;—</L>

<L>Excessive friendship, and th'afflicting state,</L>
<L>In which I found the object whom I love,</L>
<L>Destroy'd my sense, and baffled all my reason.</L>
<L>Oh had you witness'd half the poignancy,</L>
<L>Which haunts his dwelling, and corrodes his peace,</L>
<L>It must have sway'd thy stubborn heart, and wak'd</L>
<L>Within thy breast one interval of sorrow.</L>
<L>Ev'n brutes themselves, wou'd shew on this occasion,</L>

<L>Be gone. If what thou say'st be true,</L>
<L>My heart exults in it; for Oh! Orlando,</L>

<HEAD>THE AUTHOR TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>AS an apology for the many inaccuraces that may be found in this juvenile production, the reader will please to consider it as the offspring of a pen, inexperienc'd in the field of literature; that it was composed in the short space of six weeks, during intervals from mercantile em∣ployment, and at those hours, generally dedicated to the <HI>drowsy god.</HI> It is hop'd these circumstances will in some measure plead for its imperfections and avert in a degree that severity of critism justifiable when exercis'd towards more experienc'd writers.</P>
