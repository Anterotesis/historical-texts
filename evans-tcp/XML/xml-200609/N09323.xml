<OPENER><SALUTE>MY FRIENDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF the Intention of your frequent Meetings is rightly comprehended, it refers to the Amendment of an Agreement which had been <HI>too precipitately</HI> entered into, and not to the Dissolution as some vaguely imagine; I would therefore wish to recommend one Matter to your Notice at these Meetings, which a Forgetfulness of at present, may, in Time, lay you under the troublesome Necessity of amending your new Engagement.—The Matter is, a serious Consideration of the Manufactures now carrying on in this Province, and the Propriety of objecting to such Articles as can be fabricated amongst yourselves in any proportionate Equality, both in Cheapness and Goodness, to the <HI>European</HI> or <HI>East-Indian</HI>; you will thereby attract the Attention of <HI>British</HI> Adventurers, and hold out an alluring Enticement to able Mechanics and Artificers to settle amongst you.—True Patriotism is not to be found in Clamour, but in Actions that will bear the Test of Examination; I do not propose however to dictate, but submissively to hint at an apparent Advantage now offering to <HI>America</HI> in general through the Medium of your prudent Resolves.</P>
