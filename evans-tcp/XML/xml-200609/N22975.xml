<HEAD>The journall of JAMES DERKINDEREN, whome was taken on the 10 of the month comonly calld June, 1759, at Hallifax, by 6 Indians, whome shot and barbarously scalped them two before mine eyes the 3 others a little distance.—</HEAD>
<P>THIS 10 of the month I went to the go∣vernours iseland to bring up brush for to kiver my <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to spread fish on to dry, it being the Sabbath day, contrary to law or gospell, in a littell schooner who was loded with codfiish But when we got down on the beech somebody called out Indian! whome appeared with their musgets loaded and primed to our great surprise: for my own part I James Derkinderen run into the sea, the salt water as I opened my mouth went into my belly, calling to my Maker to have mercy on me: whome methinks heares the cryes of the poor and distressed now, as in old times, and will not leave us or forsake when we humble cry to him, who has all power both in heaven and earth. Those savages or Indiens pointing their muskets at us, and commanded us to cum into the wood, 2 of them fired at us. and Christoper Dyer of Casco bay was shott and an other man, with buck shott, many in them, and bleed∣ing very fast: those Indians came to them and struck the little ax in there heads, and sculped them before my eyes; O dredfull to

behold! as for the boy he run a way, but one Joseph ketched him and brought him back, and then stripped those dying men: pressent∣ly I heard the other Indiens fire, and brought the other sculps to us, and their cloaths, lea∣ving them on the ground, whome I had to beg for quarters as I had of the others; now thos thre and the other two made 5 sculps a bloody conquest endeed. Loaded their musquets and so sat of I knuw not whither, as it appered for their wigwoms; their 2 cunnoas being halled up into the woods—3 in one, and my self and the boy in the other, those sculps in the bottom of the connoa to sitt on, a bloody carpett indeed, both ter∣rable and fritefull—a time of mourning. Presently we landed on an iseland, kitched some birds egs but no appetite to eate—they gave me and the boy some—Lying on our bellyes and mourning much, and weeping bitterly; about an hour after we went on the sea, padling along untill we came to a run of water, waided and got over. We herd there was some Inglish connoes therea∣bouts—our lndens loaded their guns, tell∣ing me if they saw those connoas they would kill me, but we seed them not—Sometime they cought some trowts, they gave me some, a little left for our support more than they could eate. Parting the trees and brushes to get thru, and so 4 days before we gott to their wigwoms. Setting up a strong current

then they fireed of their guns, sot up a hol∣loing to let their people know off the blody conquest. Their wigwoms appeared and a number of Indians on a point of land. They took me to the Indians wigwam my master, and the boy to an other, about 2 days after they sold the boys unto the French; so left alone they herd there was an Englis frigate there in the gut of Cancer, but was not. As for my self I was obliged to scrap their scins—being constantly employed. And in a gust obliged with my burch hatt to stand under the trees, and very wett untill I gott a little furder, where we made a fier and so got some sleep. We came to a little town of Indians, who sot me down dancing and singing against the sun expecting to or not knowing how soone the little ax would com upon my head. But blessed be the Lord that can deliver by a small thing as well as a big: a small shower coming on they went into their wigwoms; but it seemed to me the buchers were re∣strained by an invisable power, and did not sculp me: blessed be my mercifull preserver. So those Indians came about 20 in number and toock me away by fors, but the old In∣dians would have me sculped, as sone as I got over I kissed the old Indians hand to show my thankfullnes: but it was the kind preservor that showed mercy on me, thanks and praises be to his holy name. We got to there wigwams about 20 in number

and full of Indiens, I was takeen to mr. Josephs and their boy unto cap. John Bap∣tisto. I must remark the way of keching salmon, an Indian and squa would go with theire connow and a flamboy to give light in the water and strike their speer in the salmon and ketch 20 or 30 salmon, and so divide them amongst their familyes &amp;c. When don and koocked them hollowing and rejoycing much I suppose by the way of thanksgiving. O dear friend many that is rich forgets the poor, fairing sumptuosly every day, what will become of those rich? A woman &amp;c. came padling a long shore, I walked up to them and talking to her in Inglish, my Indien mistress came behind me and box∣ed my ears sevarely. O the just judg∣ment of my God, just and equall in all his dispensations towards us. Two of the Indiens went to make a bargain for us—we went on board to fit out the schooner. When we were at their town the Indiens advised me to rite to St. Johns which I did, commanded by Adlam, a coppy of a letter sorrowing for me much, and advised the French to take me to cape Britton, which they did and so gott clear for the bargain the French with the Indians was about £10 sterling, but the French demanded £35 for me and the boy, which sum Adlam would not pay them and so came home—his advise to carry us to cape Brittoon and then the governor would

pay for us, in the gut of Cancer the Indians had killed one man and like to have taken a sloop, those Indians lay as a decay in the gutt of Cancer but got clear with the sloop into cape Britton giveing them 6 months provisions to bring in those Indians and be∣comb peasable. Dearly beloved take notes and see how that Almighty can work for the deliverance of his poor cretures man rather than deliver him to everlasting destrucktion O thou beloved of my soul praise ye the Lord and all that is within prays ye the Lord—O my soule praise the Lord for his mercy en∣dureth for ever amen.</P>
<P>Telling me to go over to our Indiens a∣cross the water and so I kissed the captains hand as if he resqued me, the old Indien women thursted I veryly believe for my blod presently the connows went into the sea and so thru the gutt leaving the high bluff of lands untill we got into a beech where we got over, keched lobsters and flat fish and crabs so got provisions; fireed of their guns and prepeared them if they should see any of the Inglish counoes, but no appearance of them, which I was very thankfull off; got to the Indians and then appeared on the land or on the point of land, a number of them meakeing me fetch water and lay down the brass kittle on my—by me while at sup∣plycating for mercy O my dr. friend the bow∣edness of the distress I was in both in boddy

and soule, neeiling on my neess on a roten tree for a fut stool a long by the beeach tree I nealed against, did you know the humble supplications I put to my mercifull preservor you would pitty men soul and bowed down in debth of adoration that this may be sang∣tifyed for the honour of God and the good of may poor soul, is the humble prayer of James Derkinderen a poor slave. O the equity and justis of a merciful God O let e∣very thing that has breath prais the Lord, for he is good and his mercyes endureth for ever, prais ye the Lord, let every thing that hath breath prais him for he is good and his mercyes endureth for ever—The leaves of this beech tree made me sick but he cured me without mony but a thankful heart—from thence we got safe to the town or to the Indians settellment and there we was untill we had like to have been set again to Halli∣fax, but I discoraged them had I a gon I veryly believe we should have had som more prissiners, about 2 or 3 days they went to the gut of Cancer but no ships there. The boy I mean Cristoper Dyer to be ransomed, thanks be to our preserver amen then got over this dismoll arrand.</P>
