<P>IT is a dangerous thing to meddle with a Metaphor. Much knowledge of crit∣icism, and with writers on rhetoric, and much good reading, are requisite. A figure proves frequently too much for a young writer to cope with; and ought to be handled with cau∣tion: hence scribblers would not often cut such droll <HI>figures</HI> in their <HI>metaphors.</HI></P>

<P>WHEN we look over the works of the antient Eastern writers, we find a great sameness in authors who were unknown to each other. Virtues and vices, the passions and inclinations, were likened to objects that surrounded, and to the various operations of nature. A man of integrity was like a <HI>rock</HI> in the sea, unmoved with the <HI>waves</HI> of vice, or the <HI>storms</HI> of adversity. Anger, like a <HI>whirlwind,</HI> destroyed whatever opposed its fury. An army <HI>poured</HI> like a torrent. The horsemen <HI>flew</HI> over the plain. Love <HI>grew,</HI> Friendship <HI>died.</HI> And benevolence <HI>scattered</HI> blessings.</P>
<P>NATURE presents nearly the same ob∣jects in all parts of the world: hence the comparisons and figures of the first rude writers of any country have so much sim∣ilarity. The Rhetoric of OSSIAN differs but little from that of the Persian po∣ets, or the Jewish prophets. Much original∣ity may be seen in all their writings. But
<PB N="7" REF="032708_0005_0FF42BC3F4725C70"/>
when writers multiplied, and Criticism be∣gan to enact her laws, impose her regulations, and set bounds to the irregular sallies of imagination, originality of sentiment was in a great measure wanting. The Poet read the Iliad; observed what ARISTOTLE or LON∣GINUS condemned, and imitated his beauties, but scarcely dared to wander from his path, lest the Critic should censure his deviations. Fancy, who, with pleasure, before wantoned in the garden of rhetoric, collected her odoriferous flowers, or strayed to neighbor∣ing groves, or clumb the distant mount, to scan the beautiful and sublime of nature, was now arrested in her career. Criticism built her fences and made her enclosures, planted her vineyards and laid out her alleys; and ordered fancy never to tread prohibited grounds, nor wander from her sight.</P>

<P>I HAVE often thought that the fear of appearing before the bar of criticism, has been of essential disservice to a young genius. Tho
<PB N="8" REF="032708_0006_0FF43405A57927A8"/>
less correct, the lucubrations of a young writer display a noble wildness, and a pleasing in∣coherency. A superiority of fire and inven∣tion, mark the works of all writers who were unacquainted with the laws of criticism.</P>
<P>TO the censures of the critic, I always op∣pose the authority of the poet. The world may consider it as a happiness, that ADDISON and VOLTAIRE past not their strictures on MIL∣TON and SHAKESPEARE, before their immortal works had gained universal applause. Sin and Death would have been struck out from <HI>Paradise Lost,</HI> and the plays of SHAKESPEARE been so mangled by the amendments of VOLTAIRE, that the Frenchified Bard of AVON would hardly have thanked the philosopher of FERNEY, for his undeserved kindness.</P>

<P>A BAD writer is always a bad critic. True Taste is as uncommon as an original writer. Some men possess good taste in some branches of literature, and are deficient in others. One judges well of
<PB N="9" REF="032708_0007_0FF43407CEECDCA0"/>
prosaic composition, on one subject, another on another. Few are capable of criticising accurately on all. He that is a great proficient in grammar determines the merit of a piece by the accuracy of the spelling or the gram∣mar. Another by the style. One is pleased with the pathetic only, another with wit; one is delighted with sublimity, and another with rural simplicity. The souls of but few are possessed with apartments for a compre∣hensive satisfaction in all. I know a man who reads POPE, but never perceives any thing pleasing in MILTON. I know another who is pleased with all POPE's writings, who dispises BUTLER's HUDIBRAS or TRUMBUL's M'FINGAL. This difference of sentiment arises wholly from a want of true Taste.</P>

<P>EVERY man is a Critic; from him, whose whole life has been a continued pur∣suit of literary acquirements, to him, who was never conversant with any work but the Bible

and Pilgrim's Progress. A certain Justice of Peace, who is master of the "Town Of∣ficer," and has half a dozen old volumes in his library, is considered as an accurate judge of composition. His word sanctions the worth of every performance, in the opinion of many. The freshman, who has just gone thro VIRGIL, and has seen the works of the English poets, determines correctly the ex∣act quantum of merit in each. When he arrives to his junior year, he either grows more modest, or becomes an arrant pedant. I have seen four or five discoursing on Mr. PAINE's Prologue; the finest allegory in the English language (the allusion to the deluge) was condemned as nonsensical and incorrect. On asking their reasons for such a decision: "Why," said they, "the stage was not erected, till long after the flood, and NOAH on mount <HI>Arrarat</HI> has certainly no connection with the Theatre." Yet these gentlemen were <HI>great scholars,</HI> and could manage a knotty syllogism, or demonstrate the most intricate lemma in <HI>Enfield.</HI></P>

<P>MANY people imagine that Poetry consists entirely in a knack at rhyming; and on this presumption have often become, in their own opinions, poets of the first rate. 'Tis difficult to give a true definition of this art. Its foundation is a lively imagination. An original manner of conception and ex∣pression, a knowledge of grammar and metre, an intimate acquaintance with the passions and feelings, a correct judgment, long prac∣tice, much reading, and above all a good nat∣ural understanding, are essentially necessary. Scribblers being possessed of some, yet defic∣ient in most of these requisites, what time has been spent, what paper has been wasted, what pains have been taken, for the obtain∣ment of chagrin, disappointment and ridi∣cule, poverty and disgrace. Volumes have opened their eyes to infamy and closed them in eternal oblivion. The world is stocked with poetry, and poetry with nonsense or plagiarism.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="032708_0010_0FF4340DADD67388"/>Satires, songs, sonnets, odes, elegies, acros∣tics, penegyrics, pastorals, invocations, &amp;c. with neither wit, fancy, sweetness, elegance, pathos, beauty, sublimity, nor simplicity, are written for amusement and fame; printed to patronise dullness; read and admired by igno∣rance, affectation and vanity. Poems like these frequently appear in volumes, more frequently in pamphlets, but without num∣ber in magazines and newspapers. For the exemplification of this, I shall take indis∣criminately an <HI>intended</HI> elegy from a Boston paper of Nov. 1795, and point out its deficien∣ces, in grammar, in metre, in poetical expres∣sion and conception, together with the in∣sipidity and incoherency of the ideas.</P>

<P>INACCURACIES of thought, occasion∣ed by a carelessness, common with great writers in a noble frenzy of ideas, when war∣med with the subject, and anxious to com∣pleat the sentiments, unless they are very fre∣quent, the true critic always expects to find, and is never greatly displeased.

<P>MUCH has been said, and much has been written, on stile. A diversity of stile exists both in poetry and prose; but mostly in poetry. The <HI>nervous, dry, laconic, flowery,</HI> &amp;c. are equally seen in both; added to which there arises in poetry a great variety, which depends on the construction of poetical sen∣tences, the metre, tranposition and rhyme. Every one is apt to degrade the stile he is un∣able to reach. One speaks highly of the ease, nature and simplicity of Addison.
<PB N="22" REF="032708_0020_0FF4342DF7A577D8"/>
Another recommends Gibbon and Johnson. The stately stiffness, the labored elegance of periods, wound off <HI>in rotundo,</HI> so common in Gibbon's Roman History, are admired by writers, who approximate to his manner, and condemned by those who are unable to com∣mand a pompous grandeur of periods. The Prompter laughs at Doctor Johnson: but his Lives of the Poets, while it discovers all the Critic, and all the Biographer, with re∣gard to stile, is the first prose performance in the English language. But the formation of a stile engages so much of the attention of many, that sentiment is often entirely ex∣cluded. Many measure the merit of a per∣formance entirely by its stile. I have read over <HI>orations</HI> and <HI>poems,</HI> a few obsolete obser∣vations, properly repeated, diversified and spun out, are sufficient to gain admiration. Sentence succeeds sentence, beneath my eye, a gorgeous troop of <HI>dwarfs,</HI> in <HI>giant apparel.</HI> I would rather see <HI>sentiment,</HI> with not a rag to her back, than such an awkward abun∣dance of <HI>fine clothes,</HI> with nobody to wear them.</P>

<P>SO much attention is paid and so much care taken to form a stile similar to some em∣inent writer, that the cultivation of language, rather than of ideas, becomes the study of those who are anxious to distinguish them∣selves in the literary world. Stile is not a matter of such importance as supposed by many. No man was less attentive to stile than Swift; yet the prose works of but few are more admired. There is a mechanical manner of constructing sentences, of which some have availed themselves. The triad so frequent in Johnson's works, the insertion of an adjective, before almost every substantive, commencing a sentence with a participle or adjective, the transposition of sentences in imitation of the Latins; and every one's read∣ing will furnish him with a variety of other ways to raise and embellish the ideas. But by a continual repetition the art is seen and displeases. And unless the sentiments are equal to the stile, it resembles a splendid
<PB N="24" REF="032708_0022_0FF43433CA189070"/>
palace without furniture, or a table of ele∣gant dishes or rich plate but nothing to eat.</P>
<P>IN poetry, the language must never fal∣ter; the dignity is lost when it fails, whatever the sentiments. But there is such a charm in metre and poetical language, that the weak∣est of matter is often so graced in rhyme, as to command commendation from the uncriti∣cal multitude. Hence poetry becomes more often the refuge of dullness, than the tongue of genius.</P>

<P>THE stile of Milton's Paradise Lost, is vastly superior to any other poetical work in our language. When I read Pope, Addison, Hayley, &amp;c. I am obliged to forget Milton, or I cannot relish them. There is in Milton such a nobleness and independence of expres∣sion that every sentiment seems an hero, com∣manding his little company of words, ever ready and suitable.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="032708_0023_0FF434381AE74888"/>THE stile of poetry is varied by the rhyme. The double endings or Hudibrastic metre, are become quite common in writings of humor and satire. Butler has the honor of invention. Imitations have been frequent and sometimes successful. Trumbul's M'Fin∣gal is by no means inferior. There are but few who are not pleased with the double end∣ing: it is perfectly suitable to low subjects.</P>

<P>NO rule that will universally hold good can be given for puctuation.

<P>THE arts of embellishing poetry are innumerable. Some men devoid of genius endeavor to become poets by art. Vol∣umes are read; lines are remembered; trans∣positions, aliterations, figures &amp;c. With a heteroneous collection of unmethodised assist∣ants one sallies into rhyme; scrapes an unwel∣come acquaintance with the muses; is insen∣sible of the coolness with which he is treated; waves the banners of poetry, and considers himself as one of the first bards of the age.

<PB N="28" REF="032708_0026_0FF434418D0E1A20"/>
the improvement of the art ought to be more thoroughly attended to and understood. I impose on myself the following simple, uni∣versal rule, viz: that all words ought ever to be divided as pronounced; and all the letters, or combination of signs to express sounds, ought ever to be joined to that sylla∣ble to which they naturally belong.</P>
<P>WHEN I first attended school, words end∣ing in <HI>tion, sion,</HI> &amp;c. were spelt as two sylla∣bles. The reformation was not complete when those were united in one.</P>
<P>WE approve of, and believe true, too much of what we are taught, for habit has often the force of nature. In the word <HI>vision,</HI> s has the sound of zh, and i that of y; and the sound of zh is in the first syllable; the word ought therefore to be divided thus, <HI>vis∣ion.</HI></P>
<P>T has sometimes the sound of sh, but never of zh. Edition ought to be divided e-dit-ion: certainly if t has the sound of sh, it should be joined to the second syllable, as there it is pronounced.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER II. ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF WAR.</HEAD>
<P>IN turning over the eternal pages of sac∣red History, we are enabled to collect some few hints about the first war, that ever was undertaken, namely, the wars of heaven. That this war was a blessing to mankind may be proved from the authority of the knowing &amp; divine MILTON; for tho some of the foolish angels were rather worsted in the encounter, yet says he, to supply the place of those that were sent to chew their brim∣stone in misery, and to repeople the abode of those, whose places at their departure now became vacant, heaven thought sit to create a new world, and a new set of beings, called man; and certainly man's existence was a blessing, or it would never have been grant∣ed.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="032708_0035_0FF42C29B941F198"/>WHEN, from the bosom of savage bar∣barity began to arise societies and kingdoms; when man left the field of hunting and be∣gan to cultivate the arts of peace; from these reformations sprang wars and bloodshed. Had all lived in peace all would have been ig∣norant; all would have been on a level with the beasts; all would have been as savage as the tygers they hunted. War brought con∣quest, conquest reduction, reduction obedi∣ence, obedience emulation, emulation envy and malice, and malice again brought war. The transition has been constant and always will remain.</P>
<P>WAR carries of the dregs of society. How many, whose lives are a curse to the world and themselves, sneak out of existence with all the honors of heroes defending their country. We all must have our exit; and in the great day of reckoning what will be the difference, whether we die by the dagger, the dungeon, or the disentery? To the sound of the trumpet flock the lovers from the frowns of the fair, and rush indifferently to glory or death. At the sound of the
<PB N="38" REF="032708_0036_0FF4346178940628"/>
trumpet flock the disappointed statesman, the ambitious youth, and the veteran hero. The loud clangor of the horn, the piercing shrill∣ness of the fife, the animating pulse of the drum, the sudden whiz of the bullet, the ex∣plosion of the deep gulleted cannon, the other filled with smoke, the dying groans of the wounded, the spouting blood, the clot∣ted gore, and the mountains of departed ene∣mies, are objects, that yield the sublimest ideas, that give the mind the most horrid satisfaction, that waken revenge, push to glory, honor and happiness. Such is man, and in such barbarous scenes his soul delights, and that which he delights in is his blessing.</P>
<P>WAR has been an established kind of di∣version from the remotest days of antiquity; and would it not be highly satirizing the wis∣dom of mankind, to say that from time im∣memorial they have been ignorant of their du∣ty or have not fully known that war was a manly, rational entertainment and exercise, from the sloth and luxury of peace? Moreo∣ver, by a long continuance in the army, a soldier may learn an easy address, a graceful

step, an easy swim of movement, and a reg∣ularity of deportment, which may gain him much honor among the ladies, in an assem∣bly, or at a town meeting.</P>

<P>I SHALL conclude with a solemn invoca∣tion, that the time may soon approach, when the voice of peace shall no more be heard in our borders, when every man shall lift up his sword against his neighbor; when the prun∣ing hook shall be beat up into spears, and the ploughshare into daggers; the shovel and tongs into swords and cutlasses; old iron into fieldpieces, and old pewter into bullets; and that wars, fightings, bloodshed, devasta∣tion and destruction, shall so overrun the world, that the whole human race may fin∣ally be extirpated from existence.</P>

<P>SO numerous and unrestrained are those rougher passions of the soul, that inveigle the ear of mankind from the neglected voice of reason and conscience, that while we exercise our commiseration we may in a great measure suppress our astonishment, when we see men so anxiously solicitous to wield the sceptre of power, or loll in the chariot of lux∣ury, with all their concomitant diseases, and cares.</P>
<P>How often do we see men, without one longing or regretful look, abandon the humble vale of competence, desert the abodes of con∣tentment, and forever forget the quiet couch of repose, and the very bosom of peaceful enjoyment, to climb the craggy steeps of perilous ambition, never secure from the delusive windings of error, and the poisonous bites of the serpents of envy, and ever look∣ing with an eye of fearful apprehension on the rocks of infamy and disgrace beneath.</P>

But in the bowers of peaceful contentment and competence, unsolicitous of honors, unam∣bitious of wealth, lie more true pleasures and enjoyments, than under the tiara of papal sanctity, the crowns of monarchs sur∣rounded with flattering courtiers, the fame of philosophers with systems ill received, or the favorites of APOLLO, persecuted by igno∣rant critics, or led by the hand of poverty to the cold, damp mansions of the gloomy prison.</P>

<P>MUSIC, whether considered as a source of pleasure and rational entertainment, or as an ennobling duty in religious societies, may with propriety be denominated the sweetest rose in the garden of the polite arts. It has little connection with any of the other arts except poetry, between these there is the closest affinity.</P>
<P>EXCELLENCY in music depends on the
<PB N="47" REF="032708_0045_0FF42C1BD0CC79E0"/>
natural delicacy and conformity of the or∣gans. The same may be said with regard to a nice and intimate knowledge of accent, quantity and harmony, in poetic num∣bers.</P>
<P>As eminence in these arts depends pri∣marily on nature, and secondly on a suitable cultivation of original powers, it has been the lot of but a proportionably small part of man∣kind to distinguish themselves very greatly in the world. Hence many a HANDEL never touched an organ; and many a MIL∣TON never learned to read.</P>
<P>Though few persons ever become nice and accurate judges of music, yet the pleas∣ure derived from it is almost universal.

<P><PB N="48" REF="032708_0046_0FF434822305F140"/>A NEGLECT of music may in some sense be considered a neglect of moral duty. The ruder principles of music are found in many of the brutal and inferior parts of creation. The feathered songsters, while sporting from spray to spray, chant forth their Maker's praise. The readbreast mourns in solitary strains her absent mate: or when some un∣lucky boy has robbed her nest, and from her love and protection torn her tender young; she flutters round; and in the musical moan of grief and despair, curses the wretch, and bids and begs the pilfering hand to spare her unfledged offspring. The humming bird has music in his wings. The beauti∣ful Canary clings to the grates of his unwel∣come prison; and, in notes of lively horror, seems to implore, at least—the liberty of the yard. Nor birds alone. The regal lion stalks his lordly round, and pours his thun∣dering <HI>base</HI> to distant wilds. In vain the bleating lamb, with mild, yet melancholy cry, asks the unfeeling butcher to stay his hand. Nay, even the surly bullfrog of the meadow, in homely, yet regular notes, con∣gratulates
<PB N="49" REF="032708_0047_0FF434845E442370"/>
his companions afar off, and ban∣ishes the solemn silence of the summer's night. And shall man, endowed with such superior faculties, and capable of heaving to the high∣est pitch of human perfection the powers of harmony, shall man be silent?</P>
<P>IN all nations and all ages of the world, attention has ever been paid to music. Its first appearance, we may suppose, was exhib∣ited in the rude tunes of the shepherd while tending his flock, or in songs sung to cele∣brate the triumphs of a victor, or the down∣fal of a hero.</P>
<P>THE general regard that is now paid to music gives us the highest reason to believe that this country, ere long, will not blush at a comparison with the elder nations of the world. While the Columbian muse is lead∣ing her sons to the pinnacle of poetical excel∣lence, equal in height to the Grecian or Ro∣man name; we hope the sister art of music will not be slow in gathering her votaries, and diffusing those charms of which she is so amply possest. Wherever a genius for music
<PB N="50" REF="032708_0048_0FF42C2832C1E580"/>
is found, it deserves our greatest encourage∣ment. Shall we be inattentive to its beauties and excellencies, while according to MILTON, the very demons in the infernal regions con∣soled by its powers their horrid condition, and solaced by the notes of the harp, their grief and torment, while <HI>Satan,</HI> on the grand expe∣dition of Adam's ruin, was exploring his way thro <HI>Chaos</HI> and <HI>old night.</HI></P>

when soft music glides from her mellifflu∣ous tongue, he catches the ardor of angels, and his bosom swells with ecstacy.</P>
<P>THE towering notes of the <HI>counter,</HI> the swel∣ling sound of the <HI>tenor,</HI> the shrill animating <HI>treble,</HI> the grand majestic <HI>bass,</HI> all conspiring in glorious concord, afford the soul such rapture as the tongue is unable to describe. Such pleasing sounds throw off our cares, exalt our expectations, banish our anxieties, add ecsta∣cy to love, and awaken the most grateful and tender emotions of the breast. Such are the powers of the various modulations of harmony. Is it not then strange that so little attention is paid, and so little pains taken in many societies to become proficients in so divine an art? One reason we may assign. In many places, some elderly people, who, when young▪ had attended to some particular tunes, once much in vogue, for which they still re∣tain a superstitious fondness, continue to praise the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, in strains of <HI>nasal twang,</HI> offensive to the ears of common delicacy.

<PB N="52" REF="032708_0050_0FF4348E9F744AB8"/>
to attend. The tunes they use are the same their good old grandmothers sung in their youth; and thus, having gained a kind of hereditary approbation, still stand high in their opinion. Thus the versification of the psalms by Sternhold and Hopkins, as they were a long time printed at the end of the bible, led many to believe that the very rhymes were indited by inspiration. Hence it was with the greatest difficulty that the foolish prejudice of many could be so far overcome, as to introduce in our churches the far supe∣rior versification of Tate and Brady, or Watts. And, not many years since, the introduction of the pitchpipe, and the raising and falling of the hands for the preservation of time, were by many considered as useless and unhappy ceremonies, tending in a great measure to in∣troduce Popery among us.</P>
<P>INSTRUMENTAL music is certainly a great addition to vocal, and has the happiest effect upon it. Yet there are some, even to this day, who are unwilling to admit into public worship the bass viol, which adds so much so∣lemnity to vocal music. The reason prof∣fered
<PB N="53" REF="032708_0051_0FF42C4FC8EE7408"/>
by some is, that the bass viol looks so much like the common violin, and the common violin is commonly called a fiddle, and a fid∣dle is commonly made use of to assist in danc∣ing; therefore, the bass viol in religions soci∣eties would be apt to make the young men and women think of a fiddle, and a fiddle would lead to dancing: and thus carry their thoughts from religious meditations to danc∣ing, fiddling, and other worldly and unsuita∣ble contemplations. For which reasons the bass viol is by them inadmissible. Arguing thus—why should a man carry his legs to meeting on sunday, when perhaps those same legs carried him to a tavern the day before? The truth is, a man's legs may be of great service to him on sunday as well as week days; so may the violin contribute greatly to the innocent amusements of dancing, and yet add solemnity to church music in the house of God.</P>

<P>FASHION establishes a thousand ri∣diculous practices. I have doubted whether nature teaches the shaking of hands on find∣ing a friend that has been absent. It is a custom of four thousand years standing. At the siege of Troy, Homer fequently mentions it. One of my neighbors, who sees me gen∣erally three or four times a day, always shakes hands with me, and twitches with such violence, as to put my wrist frequently in great pain. I see no propriety in this prac∣tice. Were it customary on finding a friend to kick his shins, who would be backward in following the fashion? And there is in nature as much propriety in one practice as the other.</P>

<P><PB N="55" REF="032708_0053_0FF434947944D3E0"/>THE custom of drinking healths is not only foolish, as it answers no good purpose but is a plague.

P—, who is excessively polite, and has not been out of Boston, that sink of complaisance, more than two years, takes hold of the tankard and begins Mr.— your good health, Mr. yours, and Mr. till I find it is coming to me, and I am obliged to swallow a mouthful of roast beef, before it is half chewed; and sometimes it is my turn to say "I thank you, sir," before it is half down, and then out comes the beef on my plate again. This last practice is growing out of use, and I hope will soon be discontinued.

<P>REPETITION of old maxims often an∣swers a good purpose. I don't like to hear a clergyman repeat his text an hundred times, however, in a forenoon's discourse. The <HI>Lay Preacher</HI> is an admirable writer as well as myself, but he repeats his text too often, and interperses his sermons with too many quotations for a writer, whose fertility of in∣vention would supply him with sentences far superior to those which his universal reading affords.</P>
<P><HI>Contentment is better than riches.</HI> This is my text. Ponder it well, and there will be no necessity of repeating it. When I was at college, a rich classmate could give a Profes∣sor a beaver hat, and he in return deliver an English oration. I was poor, but contented myself with the thoughts of being able to <HI>write</HI> a better one, tho I could not <HI>buy</HI> it.

him from contempt. Money seldom accompanies merit. I would not advise a man to be very rich. It exposes him to very many inconveniences. 'Tis a plague to a wise man. Get enough to live on comforta∣bly, to treat your friends with, and lend a little to the poor, and Heaven will pay you compound interest. Be contented and easy with a little, for with bags full you cannot be <HI>more</HI> than contented.</P>
<P>IF you have a scolding wife, and can't keep her tongue still till she is in the grave, be contented; for you might as well try to remove mountains as to prevent it.</P>
<P>IF your husband gets drunk at the tavern and reproof answers no end: don't whine and cry: let him go till he kills himself and look out better next time, for another husband.</P>

<P>I PASSED by the door of a very rich man. To supply his coffers, the widow had been defrauded; the face of the poor had been ground. His house was elegant and costly; his gardens and his orchards were delightful. Every thing appeared calculated to communicate happiness. But peace nev∣er dwelt in his habitation, nor was his con∣science ever free from reproof. The son of his benefactor was the lowest menial of his kitchen. The virgins whom he had deprived of their chastity, were become common pros∣titutes. The sordid ambition, the base pleas∣ure of accumulating property, not to assist his neighbors, not to benefit a friend, not to

<P>As I was riding by, I saw his dog on his door stone; I was immediately led into a train of reflections on the dog and his master. The dog ever performed the duty of his sta∣tion according to the best of his knowledge and abilities, and always appeared contented and blest. The master never did any thing right, but thro mistake or to benefit his in∣terest. Is it not rational to believe the dog the happiest and most noble of the two ani∣mals.</P>
<P>THE next house I passed by was that of a man who was the owner of a small farm. His children were barefoot, playing round the door; his wife was spinning, and he in∣dustriously at work on his farm. He was always easy, always in good spirits, always contented. His land was well cultured, and supplied him with most of the necessaries of life. The rich man with all his lands, his farm, &amp;c. received not half so much of the good things of this world

<P>I HAVE sometimes wished that my great grandfather had left an entailed estate, and I should not as now, be obliged to earn my bread with so much difficulty. But upon mature deliberation, I am convinced that en∣tailed estates are detrimental to a republic.— Strong men, says Solomon, retain riches. Look to the men who have a strong hold in the banks. They receive 18 per cent for their money, and that by the same law which calls it usury in other men. Thus strong men retain riches and grow stronger. These banks together with the democratic societies, have a greater tendency to introduce aristoc∣racy

than all the ideal, self created British juntoes, that have been mentioned in the Chronicle, these ten years.

<Q>"Know thine own self."</Q>

<P>THIS was the precept of a certain Greek Philosopher, enforced by POPE and MASON, and acknowledged by all men to be both useful and necessary.</P>
<P>IT is the first "thing needful" to know one's self, but it is almost equally important for worldly happiness, to know other men.</P>
<P>SOME preach up the propriety of mind∣ing our own business, and not concerning ourselves in the affairs of others. This doc∣trine is not totally good. The characters of all men ought to be open to investigation: and censure, when just, ought never to be withheld. Even the name of WASHING∣TON is not sacred, and never ought to be: yet the ungrounded, malicious calumnies that have been uttered against him have made

<P>THE characters of men, after their de∣cease, are never beyond the scrutiny of truth. The old adage. <HI>Nil de mortuis nisi bonum,</HI> 'Say nothing of the dead except in their favor,' is wholly unreasonable. What shall the honest historion say of NERO? He must pass over him in silence; for not one good deed ever recommended him to notice.</P>

I rather think the Apostle had particular ref∣erence to those jacobinical preachers, who, friends of liberty and equality, take the <HI>liberty</HI> to preach without knowledge or virtue, and consider themselves as <HI>equal</HI> to the most en∣lightened divines; and thus, by good words and fair speeches, deceiving the hearts of the simple.</P>

<P>ON sunday evening last, departed this life, after a long and painful sickness, occa∣sioned by a redundancy of gall, a most ex∣cellent saddlehorse, late the property of Doc∣tor JOHN P—S—Esq. As it has been an invariable custom, almost from time immemorial, to endeavor to transmit to pos∣terity the names of those illustrious charac∣ters who have deserved well of their coun∣try, no one, I presume, will take it amiss, if I employ the attention of my readers a few moments, while I endeavor to relate the at∣chievements and delineate the most striking features of her character.</P>
<P>SHE received from nature an excellent disposition of mind, as well as great strength and stability of soul. Tho she was never in∣structed in the precepts of any religion, she
<PB N="69" REF="032708_0067_0FF42C6D4DF91660"/>
possessed many Christians virtues; such as long suffering under affliction, and patience when heavy laden, which she discovered in transporting meal bags, and performing long journies.</P>
<P>SHE was not addicted to drink, except on warm days after much labor and fatigue. During her whole life 'tis not known that she acquired a single bad habit. The vices most common to beasts of this kind, are biting, kicking, and turning over carriages. But thoughts like thee never touched her spot∣less imagination. During her illness she dis∣covered no signs of remorse, but seemed to be reflecting with pleasure that she had acted well in her sphere; and that her work was done, and well done: no guilty conscience planted her dying couch with thorns; not one tear trickled down her death pale nostrils; not one sigh escaped from her peaceful bo∣som.</P>
<P>As she was fond of company, and fre∣quently grazed, and clubed with her com∣panions in the same pasture, some inconsid∣erate
<PB N="70" REF="032708_0068_0FF434BE7A416BF0"/>
persons have villified her name by representing her to be a rank jacobin. But may that villain be the heir of eternal infamy, who could thus wantonly asperse the charac∣ter of so amiable a creature.</P>
<P>After having escaped the SCYLLA of the Botts, &amp; the Charybdis of the horse distemper, she was sucked in by the vortex of a redundant gall, and resigned her soul with composure, on sunday the 20 day of december, in the year of our LORD 1792, in the 19th year of the independence of the United States of A∣merica, aged 24 years, 5 months and 10 days, and in the 21st year of her usefulness.</P>

<L>BACK in the wilderness afar,</L>
<L>From town and city, noise and jar,</L>
<L>There went I forth with eager grade,</L>
<L>By some superior sybil led;</L>
<L>Such as Aeneas led, of yore,</L>
<L>To where he never was before,</L>
<L>Showing their judges, states and laws,</L>
<L>Returned him safe as e'er he was▪</L>
<L>Beyond the common lot of men,</L>
<L>He went, and he returned again—</L>
<L>Not so our moderns—down they go,</L>
<L>But the way back they never know.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AROUND the wilderness were seen,</L>
<L>Nor rose, nor shrub, nor feet of men;</L>
<L>But blackest trees that grew on high,</L>
<L>A thousand furlongs up the sky,</L>
<L>Beyond the ken of mortal eye:</L>
<L>Each frightful leaf on limbs grown over head</L>
<L>Extended broader than a coverlid:</L>
<L>Whene'er a breath of air appeared,</L>
<L>Ten thousand hurricanes were heard.</L>
<L>Whene'er it rained, the flood in torrents</L>
<L>Poured down their overflowing currents.</L>
<L>The sun could never pierce the leaves:</L>
<L>To other realms his rays he gives.</L>
<L><PB N="109" REF="032708_0107_0FF4342BB8DB9A60"/>Birds thrice as large as great Goliah,</L>
<L>The trees of dreadful height oft fly o'er,</L>
<L>Or light among the branches round,</L>
<L>Or skim along the trembling ground;</L>
<L>Vast whirlwinds from their wings proceed,</L>
<L>And many a mile around 'em spread.</L>
<L>Here beasts of size more bulky far,</L>
<L>Than mamouths or than mountains are;</L>
<L>Whose mouths like caverns oped, whose throats</L>
<L>Would thousand bushels hold of oats;</L>
<L>Whose tails would sweep away an army;</L>
<L>In whose long fur you well might warm you.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>ALL these were by the sybil shown;</L>
<L>While I with straightened hairs looked on—</L>
<L>Nor birds, nor beasts nor trees obstructed,</L>
<L>While by the sybil still conducted,</L>
<L>Mile after mile we travelled on,</L>
<L>Without the aid of burning sun,</L>
<L>For darkness only round us shone.</L>
<L>And now appears a horrid hole,</L>
<L>That into jelly turned my soul.</L>
<L>The sybil saw my fearful looks</L>
<L>And thus my tim'rousness rebukes;</L>

<L>WHAT awes you now? why filled with fear?</L>
<L>Undaunted tread, no harm is near.</L>
<L>This is Avernus' throat before us,</L>
<L>Of which you've heard such frightful stories:</L>
<L>'Twas Satan's feet first trod this ground,</L>
<L>Satan, thro hell's wide realms renowned,</L>
<L>No hurt can come while I am with you;</L>
<L>With bolder pace advance then prithee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOW nearer to the hole we come;</L>
<L>The smell of brimstone, hot as rum,</L>
<L>Our noses filled; and flames of fire</L>
<L>Before us rose in many a gyre.</L>
<L>Here hideous, hissing hydras creep all,</L>
<L>Whose tails wound off like meetinghouse steeple,</L>
<L>Whose eyes in bloody basons rolled;</L>
<L>At whom ev'n devils were appalled.</L>
<L>Here bloodhounds barked with iron jaws,</L>
<L>And raked the ground with angry paws.</L>
<L>With teeth of brass here redhaired cats,</L>

<L>Here was, in short, each living creature</L>

<L>Tempestuous winds about us whirl on;</L>
<L>Rocks, seas, fire, air, confound each other,</L>
<L>And rage, and roar, and make a pother.</L>
<L>These seemed the clouds of hell's broad sky,</L>
<L>Remnants, of chaos, ne'er to die —</L>
<L>Thro these we pass unhurt to flames,</L>
<L>And fires, that never yet had names—</L>
<L>On a steep, sulphurous mount we fall;</L>
<L>Down which, on hands and knees we crawl.</L>
<L>A spacious plain before us lay,</L>
<L>Red grass thereon, as dry as hay.</L>
<L>Far off a city grand was seen</L>
<L>Th' abode of Satan and his Queen,</L>
<L>Each part the knowing sybil shows,</L>
<L>And thus the explanation goes—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THIS was by Satan's order made;</L>
<L>With various tools, saw, axe and spade.</L>
<L>Now see yon towers, upraised on high,</L>
<L>And all those spires, that prick the sky:</L>

<L>You see that round them winds, the wall.</L>

<L>On him his fawning servants wait,</L>
<L>Pride, Envy, Insolence and Hate.</L>
<L>This is the work of Moloch's power,</L>
<L>Uptossed and fashioned in one hour.</L>
<L>He called together all his fellows,</L>
<L>And took a monstrous pair of bellows,</L>
<L>The nose fixed in the ground, he blew,</L>
<L>And like a mighty jug, up flew</L>
<L>That noble pile; while very warm,</L>
<L>They mould it to it's present form:</L>
<L>All done, to see't came Satan running,</L>
<L>And laught at crafty Moloch's cunning;</L>
<L>And laught so loud, as many tell,</L>
<L>He roused the lowest dephs of hell.</L>
<L>For this was Moloch raised to quality,</L>
<L>And rides the song of immortality.</L>
<L>Those other towers, in grand parade,</L>
<L>For Satan's waiting slaves were made.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>LO at the city gate the place,</L>
<L>Where tried are all the human race:</L>

<L>For some new excellence their bosoms glow,</L>
<L>And see the <HI>witling</HI> sprouting from the <HI>beau,</HI></L>

<L>Waked from dull sleep of long unnumbered years,</L>
<L>Fancy with taste in HOMER's lyre appears;</L>
<L>JOVE's messenger of both to man below.</L>
<L>Rapid and full the heavenly numbers flow;</L>
<L>Strength, fire, invention mark the rolling verse.</L>

<L>It chanced, the back part got one side on,</L>
<L>And, gravitation's centre lost,</L>
<L>The car was on the axle tost.</L>
<L>Great was his talent money getting;</L>
<L><PB N="156" REF="032708_0154_0FF42C66143781B0"/>But greater far was that of eating;</L>
<L>For here he out did every one,</L>
<L>Still eating when the rest had done,</L>
<L>Great was his skill in mathematicks,</L>
<L>In which he'd very often play tricks.</L>
<L>So much of algebra he knew,</L>
<L>He'd prove 6 minus 4 was two;</L>
<L>Could prove all <HI>Euclid's</HI> propositions,</L>
<L>Well as the best of math'maticians.</L>
<L>Deep learned, deep read in politics,</L>
<L>He knew all parliament'ry tricks;</L>
<L>He saw of councellers and kings,</L>
<L>The motions and the secret things;</L>
<L>Could o'er th' Atlantic cast his eye,</L>
<L>And ev'ry act and thought descry,</L>
<L>Would talk ten hours to only win one</L>
<L>O'er to the right side—his opinion.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Great was his skill in prophecies,</L>
<L>No man had more prophetic eyes.</L>
<L>When east the wind began to blow,</L>
<L>He always knew it would be so:</L>
<L>Predicted every coming shower,</L>
<L>But never till 'twas come, or o'er.</L>
<L>Foretold the glory of these regions</L>
<L>Would rise as high as larks or pigeons,</L>

<L>Since day of Independence shone:</L>
<L>Nay, by the day light of the skies,</L>
<L>Predicted oft the sun would rise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>RELIGION was his great <HI>chaef d' aeuvre,</HI></L>
<L>In every kind a firm believer.</L>
<L>All books religious he o'erhauled,</L>
<L>Thence culinary virtues culled,</L>
<L>Thinking by confidence in all,</L>
<L>He must be orthodoxical:</L>
<L>Moreover that perhaps there might,</L>
<L>Among so many, be one right;</L>
<L>And that a better chance he run,</L>
<L>Than those who but believed in one.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HIS skill in Latin was at best</L>
<L>Contained this side of <HI>sum es est,</HI></L>
<L>Of Greek he knew that <HI>kai</HI> was <HI>and,</HI></L>
<L>But further could not understand:</L>
<L>And yet so great in both his skill was,</L>
<L>Confuting coblers, taylors, millers,</L>
<L>Some tho't him one of learnings' pillars.</L>
<L>Of <HI>Bunyan</HI> too so great a lover,</L>

<L>And <HI>Perry's</HI> dictionary too,</L>

<L>These books his library composed,</L>
<L>And on them hours and days he dozed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now his pedigree we'll trace,</L>
<L>As far up as we can his race.</L>
<L>Than him in youth none e'er was greater,</L>
<L>A scullion boy t' a corporal's waiter.</L>
<L>In camp his fame began to grow,</L>
<L>Was corporal made, and sergeant too.</L>
<L>But happening once to be in battle,</L>
<L>He did not like the dangerous rattle,</L>
<L>Fearing dire wounds in such dire fray.</L>
<L>He took t' his heels and ran away.</L>
<L>Then with a cobler lived a while,</L>
<L>Two or three years in humble stile,</L>
<L>Then sat up for himself, and now</L>
<L>Tow'rd Gentleman Cobler 'gan to grow.</L>
<L>Noted for length of nose and ears,</L>
<L><PB N="159" REF="032708_0157_0FF434C1A77F9E38"/>And wig that well became his years;</L>
<L>Known by the short coat which he wore,</L>
<L>And breeches with the kneebands tore;</L>
<L>Known by the shortness of his shoestrings,</L>
<L>And stockings always tied with two strings;</L>
<L>Known by his shrugging up of shoulders,</L>
<L>And eyeballs glaring on beholders.</L>
<L>Known better by his yellow beard,</L>
<L>Than any thing we yet have heard.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet such indeed his virtuous worth,</L>
<L>His wit, his learning, and so forth,</L>
<L>So much did ev'ry man admire him,</L>
<L>The Governor thought best to Squire him.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now sixty years in care and strife,</L>
<L>The 'Squire had lived without a wife.</L>
<L>And now what time love's flames and fires</L>
<L>Began to kindle warm desires,</L>
<L>Lamenting that his life thus far</L>
<L>He'd spent, nor once in Venus' war,</L>
<L>A single battle dared to enter on,</L>
<L>On which he'd seen so many venturing;</L>
<L>Determining to lay aside</L>
<L>His cold indifference and pride,</L>
<L>And hatred for the other sex,</L>
<L><PB N="160" REF="032708_0158_0FF42C74D9E4DC48"/>Born as he swore to only vex,</L>

<L>Shall <HI>Wuttle</HI> live a single life,</L>
<L>Unblest with children or with wife;</L>
<L>No, I have got a maid in view,</L>
<L>A rich young girl, if fame be true,</L>
<L>Some twenty miles or more from hence,</L>
<L>In beauty great, and great in pence:</L>
<L>And tho' she's very young, no matter,</L>
<L>If I can cleverly get at her,</L>
<L>She's now just twenty six, they say,</L>
<L>And growing older ev'ry day,</L>
<L>Now split the difference and you'll see.</L>
<L>That I am only forty three.</L>
<L>Now JOHN if I could come acrost her,</L>
<L>And in smooth lover's tone accost her;</L>
<L>If, like a snake, I could but charm her,</L>
<L>A daughter of a rich old farmer,</L>
<L>If I could, by sly circumspection,</L>
<L>Wriggle me into her affection,</L>
<L>Or, with close care and cunning art,</L>
<L>Contrive a mouse trap for her heart;</L>

<L>I make no doubt I'll gain my end.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I THINK it will our best way be,</L>
<L>To hire a hack; the hack for me.</L>
<L>And next, that all may suit my mind,</L>
<L>You get a horse and ride behind.</L>
<L>Be sure, however ne'er to own</L>

<L>I think 'twould be a great deal best,</L>
<L>To have my head combed, powdered, drest▪</L>
<L>That is, my wig; for wigs you know</L>
<L>Are calculated for a show.</L>
<L>But now no more, go, do your errand,</L>
<L>And my success I dare to warrant.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE coach arrived; the wig well powdered,</L>
<L>And all his dress compleat accoutered;</L>
<L>At three o'clock in hack he got,</L>
<L>And swiftly made his horse to trot.</L>
<L>Not <HI>Phoebus,</HI> lolling in his car,</L>

<L>He stops, and <HI>John,</HI> than light'ning faster,</L>
<L>Let down the coach steps for his master;</L>
<L>But, no brass knocker on the door,</L>

<L>And drink some brandy, wine or gin.</L>
<L>So in walked <HI>Wuttle,</HI> in walked <HI>John</HI>;</L>
<L>And all their chairs sat down upon.</L>
<L>Silence ensued for half an hour,</L>
<L>The 'Squire of utterance had not power.</L>
<L>But, without having more demurrage,</L>
<L>He drank a dram to stir his courage;</L>
<L>Then, rising slowly from his chair,</L>
<L>In language high addressed the fair.</L>

<P>My name is Clarisa Farster—I was this evening walking home with my mother, when two mendevils snatched me form her— muffled my face and brought me here. In this dark chamber, sobs and sighs availed nothing—I fainted—and by the cursed mead of man's superior strength I lost—what can never be recovered—The villain (for one went out and shut the fatal key upon the door)
