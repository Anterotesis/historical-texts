<HEAD>PROLOGUE to the FATAL EF∣FECTS of SEDUCTION.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Spoken by MARTIN HARMON.</BYLINE>
<L>TO tender sympathy t' awake the soul,</L>
<L>To raise the genius and the will controul;</L>
<L>To shew the tendency of guilty love</L>
<L>And from the face of vice the mask remove;</L>
<L>To guide the steps of youth in virtue's way</L>
<L>And bar the paths in which they're apt to stray;</L>
<L>For this, when poets exercise the pen,</L>
<L>They claim the plaudits of the best of men.</L>
<L>Virtue resplendent, sheds her brilliant rays.</L>
<L>And vice, her hedious native form displays.</L>
<L>Long has the stage, in regal pomp array'd,</L>
<L>Grand scenes of suffering majesty display'd:</L>
<L>The deep distress of royalty made known,</L>
<L>Which scarcely bear the likeness of our own;</L>
<L>The gazing crowd with admiration view</L>
<L>The gaudy trapings of the pompous shew:</L>
<L>While scarce a sentiment the scenes impart</L>
<L>To raise the genius or amend the heart.</L>
<L>Our poet of to-night presents a play,</L>
<L>Form'd on the occurrence of a recent day;</L>
<L>A scene of sorrow acted in our land,</L>
<L>Which scarce a child can fail to understand:</L>
<L>He brings the troubles of a youthful maid,</L>
<L>Her virtue lost; Her innocence betray'd:</L>
<L>A scene ye fair, which for your use is pen'd,</L>
<L>By a (perhaps too bold, but) real friend:</L>
<L>Whose only aim was simply to pourtray,</L>
<L>The sad effects, when artful men betray;</L>
<L>To shew whereto such guilty pleasures lead,</L>
<L>How strict a guard the inclinations need,</L>
<L>And what sad scenes from rashness may proceed.</L>
<L><PB N="iv" REF="021815_0002_0FB5AFB5DE0B73B8"/>Critics be dumb; be wishes not applause.</L>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="act">
<STAGE><HI>Scene</HI> Sophia<HI>'s Chamber,</HI> Severus<HI>'s House, in BOSTON.</HI></STAGE>
<STAGE>SOPHIA sitting in a melancholly posture, a book in her hand. After a solemn pause she rises and speaks.</STAGE>
<L>WHAT is this world and all its fleeting joys,—</L>
<L>To me the lustre of its charms are fled▪</L>
<L>And nought remains but sorrow and repentance:</L>
<L>My father, rash <HI>Severus,</HI> has determin'd</L>
<L>To call me to a strict account to-morrow,</L>
<L>For all the sorrow bro't upon his house,</L>
<L>All the dishonor cast upon his name,</L>
<L>By my accurst seduction.</L>
<L>"Where is to-morrow? In another world!</L>
<L>"To many this is certain: The reverse is</L>
<L>"Sure to none."</L>
<L>To me, alas! to-morrow seems to open,</L>
<L>On that tremendous scene eternity!</L>
<L>But oh! the sad necessity, that urges</L>
<L>My trembling hand to cut the thread of life,</L>
<L>And put a period to mine own existence.</L>
<L>Dishonored, hasty father, didst thou know,</L>
<L>The dread of heaping sorrow upon sorrow,</L>
<L>Or adding blackness to the infamy</L>
<L>That stains the sullied honor of thy name,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="021815_0004_0FB5AFB9F8E9CB30"/>And robs thee of thy peace:</L>
<L>Oh! didst thou know, that this, and this alone,</L>
<L>Urg'd thine unhappy daughter, to conceal</L>
<L>The name and character of her seducer,</L>
<L>Thou wouldst not rashly urge her to a deed,</L>
<L>Vile as she is, must wring thine aching heart,</L>
<L>And drive her aged mother near distraction.</L>
<L>Her sister too, her lovely injured sister.</L>
<L>But hark! Methinks I hear <HI>Lysander</HI>'s step.</L>
<L>He comes this way: Oh! that we both had died,</L>
<L>E'er guilty love had cover'd us with shame.</L>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Lysander.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lysan.</SPEAKER>
<L>When I behold thy weeping eyes, <HI>Sophia,</HI></L>
<L>I sink with shame, I feel the pungent grief,</L>
<L>That wrings thy tender heart almost to bursting.</L>
<L>But well indeed might I thy sorrows feel,</L>
<L>Since mine own wickedness and indiscretion,</L>
<L>Is the accursed source from whence they sprung.</L>
<L>Yet curse me not, I am too curst already!</L>
<L>I feel the hand of Heaven bear heavy on me,</L>
<L>And trembling own my punishment is just.</L>
<L>Yet dear <HI>Sophia,</HI> if it be possible,</L>
<L>Avoid the task of publishing our guilt:</L>
<L>In pity to thy sister,—mother,—father,—</L>
<L>Conceal the name of thine accurst seducer.</L>

<SPEAKER>Sophia.</SPEAKER>
<L>Oh! <HI>Lysander,</HI> hadst thou been form'd</L>
<L>With all the softness of a fickle woman,</L>
<L>Hadst thou been form'd a woman, and a man,</L>
<L>Lovely, intrigueing, artful as thy self,</L>
<L>Had led thy youth astray; despoil'd thy virtue;</L>
<L>Had plung'd thee in the gulph of infamy,</L>
<L>And then requested thee to hide his shame;</L>
<L>While a stern father offered his protection,</L>
<L>Upon no terms but naming thy seducer,</L>
<L>Threat'ned to disinherit and abandon</L>
<L>Thee and thy guiltless child to misery</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="021815_0005_0FB5AFBB6D0669B8"/>In case thou didst conceal it;</L>
<L>How wouldst thou then conduct?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lysan.</SPEAKER>
<L>Tis difficult to answer thee <HI>Sophia</HI>;</L>
<L>Were I alone to suffer in this case,</L>
<L>Were it not deeply to affect thy parents,</L>
<L>Thy steady friend my much dishonored wife,</L>
<L>And give a licence to malignant breath,</L>
<L>To blast their reputation with my own;</L>
<L>I would advise thee, frankly to confess</L>
<L>The author of thy shame before the world▪</L>
<L>Yes, tho' black infamy and foul dishonor</L>
<L>Should blast my reputation; tho' the world</L>
<L>Should hoot me from their converse; as a wretch</L>
<L>Too vile to taint with my polluted breath</L>
<L>The common air; and spurn me as a ruffian;</L>
<L>I think, without repining, I'd endure</L>
<L>This heavy curse to mitigate thy sorrows.</L>
<L>But when I think upon the shame awaits</L>
<L>The circle of our friends, should the sad story</L>
<L>Of our incestuous, unexampled crimes,</L>
<L>Be blazon'd to a rude, unfeeling world;</L>
<L>When I conceive the trembling horror of a</L>
<L>Virtuous wife; too innocent and lovely to endure</L>
<L>So rude a shock of sorrow for my guilt:</L>
<L>A sudden terror seizes on my soul;</L>
<L>Affrighted fancy represents to view,</L>
<L>My dear <HI>Rosanna</HI> sinking to the grave,</L>
<L>That grave the untimely product of my guilt:</L>
<L>My tender offspring too—our lovely children,</L>
<L>Unconscious of the nature of their woe,</L>
<L>Raise their swoln eyes toward all-righteous heaven,</L>
<L>And plead for vengeance on the guilty cause:</L>
<L>That cause their wretched father!</L>
<L>Oh Gracious God! oh virtue! virtue! virtue!</L>
<L>What are all earthly joys compar'd to thee!</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="021815_0006_0FB5AFC55698F150"/>Possest of thee the soul can find a palace</L>
<L>In a dungeon. When thou art fled,</L>
<L>And leav'st the active conscience</L>
<L>Not callous to contempt and infamy,</L>

<L>To bouy the mind or keep the heart from sinking.</L>
<L>The soul has lost its ballance, and the wretch,</L>

<L>To recompence thy firmness by forgiveness.</L>
<L>O may its dreadful anger be appeas'd</L>
<L>By our unfeigned sorrow and repentance:</L>
<L>And may the temporal punishment, decreed</L>
<L>As chastisement for our detested crimes,</L>
<L>Escape thy head, and fail on thy seducer.</L>

<L><HI>Lysander,</HI> though I have ever wish'd</L>
<L>To bid you welcome to my house; and ever</L>
<L>Found your welfare pleasing to my heart;</L>
<L>Yet, for the present, I sincerely wish,</L>
<L>You, and all other of my friends, to leave</L>
<L>This foul polluter of her father's blood</L>
<L>To solitude and her own meditations.</L>
<L>Perhaps some spark of virtue may lie dormant</L>
<L>In her polluted breast—That spark enkindled,</L>
<L>May light her steps to tread the paths of duty;</L>
<L>Force her to yield obedience to a father,</L>
<L>And let him know the author of his shame.</L>
<L>A few short hours alone can intervene,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="021815_0007_0FB5AFC77376B690"/>Between the present instant, and the time</L>

<L>Forgive me, oh! my father,</L>
<L>While I dare, in very bitterness of soul, remonstrate,</L>
<L>Against this seeming rash determination.</L>
<L>In the events of life, ofttimes it happens,</L>
<L>The greatest sages labour under error;</L>
<L>Perhaps the penetration of my father,</L>
<L>In wisdom more than years, by far, superior</L>
<L>To him who dares call his resolve in question,</L>
<L>May labor under error in this case.</L>
<L>Should you proceed with less precipitation</L>
<L>Some happier hour may lead her to comply</L>
<L>And make the author of her ruin known.</L>
<L>Or time may show it was not stubbornness</L>
<L>Or disaffection, but pity to yourself,</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Spoken by <HI>WILLIAM GRISWOLD,</HI> in his female dress.</BYLINE>
<L><HI>LADIES</HI> and Gentlemen, with leave, I'd say,</L>
<L>A word or two, to Epilogue the play.</L>
<L>Our Poet, (I beseech his worship's grace,</L>
<L>Perhaps I'm blaming him before his face):</L>
<L>But to my youthful fancy it appears,</L>
<L>Tho' his sad scenes may leave the house in tears.</L>
<L>He in the plot, or execution, errs.</L>
<L>For instance, does a single scene disclose</L>
<L>The stratagems produc'd <HI>Sophia's</HI> woes?</L>
<L>Or does the Poet paint <HI>Lysander's</HI> wiles,</L>
<L>By which, at length, her virtue be beguiles;</L>
<L>Or show the noble struglings of her soul,</L>
<L>While gentle virtue bore supreme controul,</L>
<L>Ere vice had cast its shade upon the whole?</L>
<L>Had he done this, it might have taught the fair</L>
<L>Of projects similar to have been aware:</L>
<L>And when, in future, artful men had strove</L>
<L>To urge them on to scenes of lawless love,</L>
<L>Forewarn'd, they likewise might have been forearm'd,</L>
<L>Vice dropt its mask, and virtue stood alarm'd.</L>
<L>But, stop—methinks I hear the scribler say—</L>
<L>Softly young miss,—let reason have fair play,</L>
<L>I've shown <HI>Lysander</HI> was a man of parts,</L>
<L>Form'd, (if inclin'd) to endanger female hearts:</L>
<L>Handsome, engaging, artful, debonaire,</L>
<L>The very thing the incautious to ensnare;</L>
