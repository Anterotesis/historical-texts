<P>PRESERVATION; OR, THE HOVEL OF THE ROCKS. A PLAY, IN FIVE ACTS; INTERSPERSED WITH PART OF LILLO's DRAMA, IN THREE ACTS, CALLED "FATAL CURIOSITY."</P>
<P>BY J. B. WILLIAMSON, DIRECTOR OF THE THEATRE IN CHARLESTON.</P>
<P>Performed in LONDON, and at BOSTON (Massachusetts) with the most flattering Success.</P>

<HEAD>Prefatory Address.</HEAD>
<P>ENGAGED, professionally, for a number of years in the direction of theatres, an intimate acquaintance with dramatic authors, early as well as modern, was an unavoidable consequence: the plays of Lillo, preeminently claim attention; the pure ethics, the striking example, the power∣ful sympathy, inculcated and excited in them, together with the sublime and nervous simplicity of his language, and pathos of his characters, rank him high as a dramatist: an elegant <HI>French Critic</HI> quotes some scenes of Lillo's <HI>George Barnwell,</HI> as "a standard of dramatic writing." To the mutations of manners, in part, and to the improved state of the English stage, are ascribable, that extreme sensibility, and refine∣ment of taste, which condemn the plays of this author to the closet: to purge the passions by scenes of terror and agony, is no longer held as an es∣sential of the Tragic Muse! The Play of "<HI>Fatal Curiosity</HI>" has been frequently exhibited under the direction of that excellent critic, the
<PB N="vi" REF="039110_0004_10139D2B9E67B4E8"/>
late Mr. Colman; but the sombre tints of the subject, the undivided interest of the incidents, chaining the mind to the heart-rending catas∣trophe, (after repeated efforts, on the part of the public, to relish the bold, but terrific colour∣ing of Lillo) returned it to the shelf; sealed up from future representations, by faintings, groans, and every other possible expression of agony, in the audience.</P>
<P>Impressed with its merit, and sedulously pur∣suing every research for the public amusement, I took the Play to pieces, and interwove with it an episodical plot; with a view, by dividing the at∣tention, without weakening the interest of the original, to relieve the incidents; and the course of events opening a probable medium for chang∣ing the catastrophe, I adopted, it:—In the per∣formance it has answered my most sanguine ex∣pectations.</P>
<P>If the admirers of Lillo, in his majestic ter∣rors, will forgive the freedom I have used; if the public can reap one additiona gratification at the theatre from my labours, my object is com∣pletely attained. I write not for applause; my
<PB N="vii" REF="039110_0005_10139D2D229996F8"/>
end is not fame: Lost, alas! is that talent, for which I was covetous of praise—mute is the voice, which, from the rapturous applause of theatres, caught not the estimation of its own value, half so much, as from the reflected expression of my gratitude.—Peace, gentle Shade! yet, sweetly embalmed in the memory of an enlightened public.</P>

<L>HOW fierce and stormy night comes blust'ring on!</L>
<L>The bending welkin threatens; and the wind</L>

<L>As if no change could ruffle her smooth reign.</L>
<L>Sad emblem of my life! Whose op'ning dawn</L>

<L>Bliss of my youth and comfort of my age!</L>

<L>Let penitence atone our dark design,</L>

<SPEAKER>Y. WILMOT.</SPEAKER>
<L>In bliss unutterable! Nay, dry those tears—</L>
<L>My ever honor'd—my beloved parents!—</L>
<STAGE>(Kneels and kisses them.)</STAGE>
<L>And that I live, next to the care of Heaven,</L>
<L>Is owing to my father's guardian arm:—</L>
<L>That villain else—that most unnat'ral villain!</L>
<STAGE>(Pointing to Malign.)</STAGE>
<L>Who has confess'd, spite of the ties of blood,</L>
<L>And laws divine and human that he sought</L>
<L>My life—had stol'n on my defenceless sleep,</L>
<L>And dealt on me that death—his just reward.</L>

<SPEAKER>MALIGN.</SPEAKER>
<L>I own my crime—nay more, my folly too!)</L>
<L>Had I, with patience, waited the event,</L>
<L>The father's desp'rate hand had done the deed,</L>
<L>And slaughter'd his own son!—I overheard,</L>
<L>But fear'd his resolution.—May this awake</L>
<L>Fell rancour 'twixt your souls—and hence may feuds</L>
<L>Spread discord through your families forever!</L>
<L>I die! Wilmot, remember this—the blow,</L>
<L>That's mortal here—thy parents meant for thee.</L>

<SPEAKER>O. WILMOT.</SPEAKER>
<L>Not so, my son!</L>
<L>Thy parents kneel, and ask of thee forgiveness,</L>
<L>And intercession, at the Throne of Mercy,</L>
<L>For their acknowledg'd guilt!—Yet, let me say,</L>
<L>And 'tis but justice—that the guilty thought,</L>
<L>Whose soul conception punishes itself,</L>
<L>Was not imagin'd, thinking you our son.</L>
<L>That were impossible!—Heav'n made our guilt</L>
<L>Thy preservation! When most offended,</L>
<L>Restrain'd the self-inflicted scourge, and bid</L>
<L>Its amplest mercy beam upon our fault!—</L>
<L>Can'st thou forgive?—</L>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Y. WILMOT.</SPEAKER>
<L>My ever honor'd parents!</L>
<L>This posture fits not you—O, rise! And let</L>
<L>No thought of sorrows past, o'er cloud the joy,</L>
<L>That waits to crown us thro' our lives to come!—</L>
<L>Heav'n weighs our trials, and compares our strength;—</L>
<L>And proves, in its vast mercies, it accepts</L>
<L>The sacrifice of penitence sincere.—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARNOLD.</SPEAKER>
<L>Nay, multiplies our joys, by its afflictions!—</L>
<L>For know, thou happy father, it is thine,</L>
<L>Twice t'have preserv'd the valued life you gave.</L>
<L>Let that appease each self-accusing thought:</L>

<L>The objects of your charitable succour</L>

<L>We have escap'd! Yet had we been forsaken,</L>
<L>As I, too oft, have impiously urg'd,</L>

<L>To spread, by heart-adorning sympathy,</L>
<L>The bliss, which each in this fond circle feels;</L>
