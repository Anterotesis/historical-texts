<HEAD>PREFACE▪ To the Second Part.</HEAD>
<P>THE design of this Part of the Institute, is to frame a Grammar of our own language upon its true principles, and calculate it for the benefit of common English schools. No Grammar, that has hitherto appeared, seems well adapted to answer this particular purpose. Mr. Dilworth's, which has had the most general circulation in America, is not con∣structed upon the principles of the English language; it is, to use the words of an eminent scholar and critic, "A mere Latin Grammar, very indifferent∣ly translated." As to those articles in which all languages agree, such as the general definition of nouns, adjectives, &amp;c. he is usually right; but wherever our language is built upon principles pe∣culiar to itself, he is invariably wrong. We are apt to be surprised, that men who made the languages their principal study, and during their whole lives, were employed in teaching youth, should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dis∣cover that the Grammar of one language would not answer for another; but our wonder will cease when we reflect, that the English nation a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> large have, till very lately, entertained the idea that our lan∣guage was incapable of being reduced to a sy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of rules; and that even now many men of much classical learning warmly contend that the only way of ac∣quiring, a grammatical knowledge of the <HI>English Tongue,</HI> is first to learn a <HI>Latin Grammar,</HI> That such a stupid opinion should ever have prevailed in the English nation—that it should still have advo∣cates—nay that it should still be carried into prac∣tice, can be resolved into no cause <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the amazing influence of habit upon the human mind.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="018871_0003_0FA8213734DD4788"/>Our language has now arrived to a great degree of purity: and many writers of the last and present age have, both in elegance and sublimity of style, equaled, if not surpassed the Roman authors of the Augustan age. To frame such a Grammar as to in∣struct our own youth, as well as foreigners, in this purity of style, is the business of a Grammarian— a business that appears to be not yet accomplished.</P>
<P>Dr. Lowth was well acquainted with the origin and genius of the language; and his <HI>Short Introduc∣tion to English Grammar,</HI> which is an original per∣formance, cannot be studied with too much atten∣tion. But his style and method, are not suited to the capacities of youth; his treatise was expressly designed for a <HI>private and domestic use,</HI> and is exceed∣ingly well calculated for this particular purpose, as well as for schools of a higher class. But with re∣spect to the Imperative Mode, the Passive Verb and some other matters of less moment, he seems to have fallen into obvious mistakes; and in the in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>exion of verbs he is exceedingly defective.</P>
<P>Mr. B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hanan, a later and much celebrated Gram∣marian, has given the world a <HI>Regular English Syn∣tax</HI>▪ he has improved upon Dr. Lowth's method and made many judicious remarks upon the con∣struction and arrangement of periods: But in the particulars above mentioned, he is liable to the same exceptions as his predecessor.</P>
<P>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ash has corrected some errors and supplied some defects of these Authors; but has omitted other articles of equal importance.</P>
<P>In the short treatise here presented to the public, I have endeavoured to throw the principles of our language into a style and method suited to the most ordinary capacities. I have generally adhered to the systems of the respectable authorities above mentioned: Whenever I have deviated, it was with reluctance, but with the fullest persuasion that I was
<PB N="5" REF="018871_0004_0FA821386615F448"/>
warranted by the nature and idioms of the lan∣guage.</P>
<P>In that new and complicated subject, the illustra∣tion of our helping verbs o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> auxiliary signs, I was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bliged to struggle with a multitude of embarrass∣ments almost insuperable. And after my most la∣borious efforts to define their several meanings and explain their various combinations with accuracy and perspicuity, I must confess the execution of the design is scarcely satisfactory even to myself. I was under a necessity of introducing a variety of distinc∣tions and terms unknown to former Grammars, which may possibly offend those who are firmly at∣tached to the rules and forms of antiquity. But something of this kind is certainly wanted: Our auxiliary signs enable us to express the circumstances of time and mode, of power, liberty, necessity, obli∣gation, promise, determination and inclination, with greater clearness and precision, than can be done in any other language with which we are acquainted. But we have no Grammar that unfolds this intricate subject; and though we are enabled to learn our own language by the ear, yet foreigners seldom or never acquire such a knowledge of our verbs as to use them with tolerable propriety. I have attended to their investigation with uncommon assiduity and in my researches, have perhaps found more difficulties than I am able to remove. I flatter myself, however, that upon strict examination, it will be judged that I have introduced no distinction without a differ∣ence, and that the propriety of any deviation from the received rules of former Grammars, is supported by the established principles of the language.</P>
<P>The prosody of our language has been neglected or mistaken as much as any part of Grammar. That master-key to the pronunciation of English, the sylla∣bic accent, has been very little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nderstood. Mr. Sheridan is the first who has been sensible of
<PB N="6" REF="018871_0005_0FA82138DDF97640"/>
its importance, and he is perhaps better acquaint∣ed with its utility in prose than in verse. An at∣tempt to investigate the rules of numerous compo∣sition and illustrate them by examples from the best authorities, seemed necessary to complete this Part of the Institute.</P>
<P>In all the rules, definitions and illustrations, accu∣racy and perspicuity have been my principal study; and I cannot but think that this will be sufficient to justify the length of the Dissertation on the Auxilia∣ries, as well as several repetitions in the examples of false construction and inelegant arrangement.</P>

<HEAD>OF GRAMMAR.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Grammar consists of four parts; viz. Orthography, Pros∣ody, analogy and Syntax. Orthography teaches to spell and write words with proper letters. Prosody teaches a true pronunciation of words. Analogy or Etymology teaches the derivation and declension of words. Syntax teaches the proper arrangement of words in Sentences. Orthography and Prosody in general, are the subject of the first part of this Institute. Prosody, appli∣ed to verse; Analogy and Syntax are the subjects of this second Part or Grammar.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P><HI>What is Grammar?</HI> GRAMMAR is the art of speaking and writing our thoughts with propriety.</P>
<P><HI>What is the subject of Grammar?</HI> Grammar treats of Letters, Syllables, Words and Sentences.</P>
<P><HI>What is a Letter?</HI>A <HI>Letter</HI> is a mark of a simple found, of which there are twenty six in English. We have also seve∣ral simple sounds expressed by double Letters.</P>
<P><HI>What is a Syllable?</HI> A <HI>Syllable</HI> is one letter, or a union of so many let∣ters as can be pronounced at one breath. A <HI>vowel</HI> may make a syllable of itself; but consonant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣out vowels, cannot make a syllable; except the half-vowels, which may make an imperfect syllable of themselves.</P>

<HEAD>Of WORDS.</HEAD>
<P><HI>What are Words?</HI> Words are articulate sounds used by common consent as signs of ideas or notions.</P>
<P><HI>Written words</HI> are composed of letters to which custom has affixed certain sounds.</P>
<P><HI>How many sorts of words are there?</HI> Three, primitive, derivative, and compound.</P>
<P><HI>What is a primitive word?</HI> A primitive or simple word is such as is not derived and can not be separated into parts without destroy∣ing the word; as, man, hope, good, bless, agree.</P>
<P><HI>What is a derivative word?</HI> A derivative is a primitive word, with the addi∣tion of one or more syllables; as, man-ly, hope-less, good-ness, bless-ing, agree-able.</P>
<P><HI>What is a compound word?</HI> A compound word is formed of two or more sim∣ple words; as, country-man, gold-smith, ink-horn; or of a simple word and a preposition; as, over-come, with-draw, dis-engage.</P>
<P><HI>How must derivative words be spelled?</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> general the primitive word must be preserved en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; as, turn-ed, nation-al, book-ish, learn-ing; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he following exceptions must be observed.</P>
<P>1. When the primitive word ends with a vowel and the syllable that is added, begins with a vowel, the first vowel must be dropped; as in the following.</P>

<P><HI>How is a noun divided?</HI> Nouns are either <HI>proper</HI> or <HI>common.</HI></P>
<P><HI>What is a proper noun?</HI> A proper noun is the name of an individual, when there is but one thing of that kind; as, <HI>George, Phila∣delphia, Missisippi.</HI></P>

The reason is, because without articles the names are as certain and determinate as they can be.</P>
<P><HI>Will proper nouns admit of the plural number?</HI> Never, except when there are two persons of the same name; as, "the two <HI>Howes;</HI>" and in this case, they seem to become common nouns. But we can not say "the two <HI>Bostons,</HI>" because there is but one.</P>

<HEAD>VERB.</HEAD>
<P><HI>What is a verb?</HI> A <HI>verb</HI> is a part of speech that signifies <HI>being</HI> or <HI>doing.</HI></P>
<P><HI>How many kinds of verbs are there?</HI> Two, transitive and intransitive<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This is the most accurate and unexceptionable division of verbs; the common division into <HI>active, passive</HI> and <HI>neu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er</HI> is faulty. Many verbs commonly called <HI>active,</HI> imply no action at all, or of the mind only; as, to <HI>see,</HI> to <HI>desire,</HI> to <HI>feel;</HI> while some that are ranked under the term <HI>neuter,</HI> imply <HI>action</HI> merely; as, to <HI>run,</HI> to <HI>fly,</HI> &amp;c. The division into transitive and intransitive, admits of no exception.</P>
<P>As to <HI>passive</HI> verbs, we have no such thing in the language. I cannot better express my ideas on this subject, than in the words of Dr. Ash, in a Grammar prefixed to his Dictionary. He ob∣serves that "Properly speaking, there is no <HI>passive</HI> verb in the English language; for though, <HI>I am loved,</HI> is commonly called a <HI>passive</HI> verb, yet <HI>love</HI> is no part of the <HI>verb,</HI> but a <HI>participle</HI> or <HI>adjective</HI> derived of the verb, <HI>love.</HI>" "I am very sensible that the greatest man<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Lowth, followed by Buchanan.</NOTE>, perhaps, that ever wrote on the subject, is of a different opinion. He says, "There are three kinds of verbs active, <HI>passive</HI> and neuter." And when he comes to the gram∣matical resolution of this sentence, "<HI>In whom I am well pleased;</HI>" he tells us that <HI>am</HI> is "The indicative mode, present time, and first person singular of the neuter verb <HI>to be; well</HI> an adverb; <HI>pleased</HI> the passive participle of the verb <HI>to please,</HI> making with the aux∣iliary verb <HI>am,</HI> a <HI>passive</HI> verb." The consideration of this, I must confess, could by no means induce me to suppress the above note. In parsing every word should be considered as a distinct part of speech; for though two or more words may be united to form a mode, a tense or a comparison; yet, it seems quite im∣proper to unite two or more words to make a noun, a verb or an adjective, &amp;c."</P>
<P>I am happy to find my own opinion supported by so respectable an authority as Dr. Ash; both with regard to the passive verb and the i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>perative mode. Grammarians, conforming to the inflection of Latin verbs, without attending to the principles of our own language, have considered the verb <HI>let</HI> merely as an aux∣iliary sign and have used it to form the first and third Persons of the imperative mode. It may be doubted whether, in any case, the imperative admits of these persons; the second person only being the object of command or exhortation. But in most cases, <HI>let</HI> is certainly a principal verb, of the same import as <HI>permit</HI> or <HI>suffer,</HI> and used in the second person of the imperative mode. These expressions therefore, <HI>let me write, let him write,</HI> so far from being the first and third persons, are in fact the second per∣son of the imperative. In some instances, they are merely ad∣visory, but in many cases, they imply a command, directed to a second person.</P>
<P>If a person hold me fast and I say to him, <HI>let me go,</HI> I presume no one will contend that this is a command or exhortation di∣rected to myself. In the first person plural, <HI>let us go,</HI> has the force of advice and exhortation to a number, among whom, the speaker includes himself, and this may possibly be called the first person of the imperative; but, <HI>let me, let him</HI> and <HI>let them,</HI> must be considered as the second person, implying the same as <HI>suffer</HI> or <HI>permit</HI> me, &amp;c. The Romans used the first person of the sub∣junctive mode for the purpose of exhorting; not having any first person in the imperative. The French imperative has all persons, except the first of the singular. The English imperative has no person but the second; to supply the place of the first and third in other languages, we use the verb <HI>let,</HI> with a pronoun in the objective case and a verb in the infinitive.</P></NOTE>. A transitive verb implies some action that passes over from the
<PB N="20" REF="018871_0019_0FA82143D8225070"/>
agent to the object; as, <HI>he loves virtue.</HI> Here the action of <HI>loving</HI> passes from the agent <HI>he</HI> to the ob∣ject <HI>virtue.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="018871_0020_0FA821448C006728"/>
<HI>What is an intransitive verb?</HI> An intransitive verb implies <HI>action</HI> or <HI>being</HI> which is all confined to the agent or nominative word; therefore an object can follow the verb; as, <HI>I remain —he liv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s—it dies —we run.</HI></P>
<P><HI>How do we know a transitive verb from an intransitive?</HI> If a verb will admit an object after it, it is transi∣tive; as, "I admire fidelity." "I abhor treachery." If a verb will not admit an object after it, it is in∣transitive; as, "I remain him" "I cease vice." The impropriety of these last expressions, shows that the verbs <HI>remain</HI> and <HI>cease,</HI> are intransitive.</P>
<P>Verbs intransitive admit objective words after them of the same signification; as, "to live a life of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>." "to dream a dream, &amp;c."</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> verbs are to be considered, the persons, num∣ber<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, modes and tenses.</P>
<P><HI>How many persons are there?</HI> Three, in each number, <HI>I, thou,</HI> and <HI>he, she</HI> or <HI>it</HI> in the singular number; <HI>we, ye</HI> or <HI>you,</HI> and <HI>they</HI> in the plural. These are the agents or nominative words to verbs.</P>
<P><HI>How many numbers are there?</HI> Two, the singular, and plural, as in nouns.</P>
<P>The modes and tenses are explained in the disser∣tation.</P>
<P><HI>What are participles?</HI> Participles are words derived of verbs, and have the nature of verbs, adjectives or nouns. They al∣ways end in <HI>ing, d, t, n</HI> or <HI>ght</HI>▪ as from the verbs, <HI>move, dwell, write, teach,</HI> are derived the participles, <HI>moving, moved, dwelt, written, taught</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The division of participles into active, perfect and passive, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by no means accurate; and that into, present, perfect and passive, in wholly de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ive.

<HI>How do the English form the different modes, tenses and persons of the verbs?</HI> Principally by the help of several small words which are called, from their use, <HI>auxiliaries,</HI> that is, helpers.</P>
<P>The proper uses of the English auxiliaries being so intricate and embarrassing, especially to foreign∣ers, and so little understood even by those to whom the language is vernacular, I shall attempt a critical investigation of the subject in the following DISSERTATION.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD> MODE.</HEAD>
<P>Mode is the manner of representing a being or action.</P>
<P>The Modes are five; the Infinitive, Indicative, Imperative, Potential and Subjunctive. The infini∣tive expresses an action or being indefinitely, with∣out regard to number or person; as, <HI>to see, to learn.</HI></P>
<P>The indicative <HI>declares</HI> some action absolutuly or asks a question in order to obtain a declaration; as, <HI>I see, do I see</HI>?</P>
<P>The imperative commands and exhorts; as, <HI>see, do thou see.</HI></P>
<P>The potential declares the <HI>liberty, power, necessity, inclination</HI> and <HI>obligation</HI> of the agents, which are ex∣pressed
<PB N="23" REF="018871_0022_0FA82147FB59F070"/>
by the signs, <HI>may, can, must, would, should,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The subjunctive represents an action under some <HI>condition</HI> or <HI>limitation,</HI> or else <HI>doubtful</HI>; and is always preceded by a verb or some conjunction; as, <HI>if, though, unless, whether,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>TENSE.</HEAD>
<P>Tense is the time of an action or being.</P>
<P>Time is, strictly speaking, divided only into present, past, and future. But as we have occasion to point out the time of action with more precision, we are obliged to use other artificial tenses both simple and compound. I shall therefore divide the tenses as usual into present, imperfect, perfect, pluperfect, and future, with the compound perfect and future.</P>
<P>The present tense represents an action as now performing; as, <HI>I write.</HI></P>
<P>The imperfect expresses an action that is past; as, <HI>I wrote.</HI></P>
<P>The perfect represents an action as past and com∣pleted; as, <HI>I have written.</HI></P>
<P>The pluperfect represents an action as past, prior to some period of time specified in the sentence; as, "<HI>I had written,</HI> when he came in."</P>
<P>The future represents an action as yet to come; as, <HI>I shall write.</HI></P>
<P>We use a tense compounded of the perfect and fu∣ture, which I call the compound future: this denotes that at some time specified, an action will be past; as, "when you have supped, <HI>I shall have finished</HI> my business."</P>
<P>The expression, <HI>I may have written,</HI> seems, to be a compound of the present and perfect, in the poten∣tial mode. It expresses a <HI>present</HI> possibility that an action has been done in some <HI>past</HI> time: This I call the compound perfect.</P>
<P>But there is another important distinction of tenses, peculiar to the English Language, viz. into <HI>indefinite</HI> and <HI>definite.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="018871_0023_0FA8214941BDCD00"/>The indefinite tenses represent an action as present, past or future, in a vague indeterminate manner; the definite, ascertain some particular time or circum∣stances of action.</P>
<P>The definite tenses are formed by the verb <HI>to be</HI> and the participle in <HI>ing</HI>; as, <HI>I am writing.</HI> The dif∣ference in the use of these tenses, requires particular explanation.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>Present Indefinite.
<LIST>
<LABEL>I love. I write.</LABEL>
<ITEM>These expressions, though evidently in the present tense, do not denote any par∣ticular exercise of body or mind now per∣forming or existing—they convey general and vague ideas.

<HEAD>AUXILIARY SIGNS OR HELPING VERBS.</HEAD>
<P>The English auxiliary signs are, do, be, have, shall, will, may, can, should, would, might, could, and must, with their variations.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="verb">
<HEAD>DO.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Do</HI> which makes <HI>did</HI> in the past time, is used either as a transitive verb, or as an auxiliary. As a tran∣sitive verb, it signifies <HI>to perform,</HI> and is varied in all modes and tenses, with the help of the auxiliary signs and its participle <HI>done;</HI> as, I have done, I might have done, &amp;c. But as an auxiliary, it is used only in the present and imperfect tenses, to answer the following purposes:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. To express emphasis; as, "Perdition catch my soul, but I <HI>do</HI> love thee."</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. To save the repetition of another verb; as, "you write better than I <HI>do:</HI> that is, than I write."</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. To ask questions; as, <HI>do</HI> I write? or express command; as, <HI>do</HI> you write.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>In all other cases, it seems to be inelegant and ob∣solete.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="verb">
<HEAD>BE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Be</HI> is either a principal verb or an auxiliary. When a principal verb, it is intransitive, signifying
<PB N="27" REF="018871_0026_0FA8214B5A854A98"/>
merely <HI>being</HI> or <HI>existence,</HI> and is varied in all modes and tenses with the auxiliaries and its participle <HI>been</HI>; as, I have been, I could have been, &amp;c. As an auxiliary, it is merely a sign of time, and assists in forming the various modes and tenses of our prin∣cipal verbs, as will be hereafter explained.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="verb">
<HEAD>HAVE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Have</HI> is both a principal verb and an auxiliary. When a principal verb, it is transitive and signifies to <HI>hold</HI> or <HI>possess.</HI> It is used in all modes and tenses with the other auxiliaries; as, <HI>I have, I shall have, I had had;</HI> in which last expression, the first <HI>had</HI> is an auxiliary, and merely a sign of the pluperfect tense, and the last, a transitive verb, denoting posses∣sion.</P>
<P>As an auxiliary, it is merely a sign of time.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="verb">
<HEAD>SHALL.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Shall</HI> is always a sign of the future tense.</P>
<P>In the first person, both singular and plural▪ shall simply foretells an event; as, "I or we <HI>shall</HI> go to∣morrow."</P>
<P>But in the second and third persons, it promises; as, "you shall have your money to-morrow;" or, it implies determination or threatning in the speaker; as, "he <HI>shall</HI> go, or I will punish him."</P>
<P>The several significations of <HI>shall</HI> are also variously affected by the manner in which it is uttered. In the first person without emphasis, it foretells; but when uttered with emphasis, it expresses a much greater degree of certainty; as, "I <HI>shall</HI> be there, you may depend on it." In the second and third persons, without emphasis, it barely promises; as, "he shall be paid:" but with emphasis, it promises with determination; as, "he <HI>shall</HI> have his money at all events;" or it has the force of a threatning or command; as, "you <HI>shall</HI> behave better; the boys <HI>shall</HI> study, or I will punish them."</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="verb">
<PB N="28" REF="018871_0027_0FA8214C1A209170"/>
<HEAD>WILL.</HEAD>
<P>This is also a sign of the future tense; but for the most part, is directly the reverse of <HI>shall;</HI> that is, it has the same force or meaning as <HI>shall,</HI> but in differ∣ent persons. In the first person, it promises; as, "I will write:" In the second and third, it simply foretells; as, "you will or he will go to Philadel∣phia." An emphasis, in the first person, adds force to a promise and amounts to a determination in the person promising; as, "I <HI>will</HI> come, upon my hon∣our; I <HI>will</HI> go, at all events." An emphasis in the second and third persons foretells an event with greater assurance.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="verb">
<HEAD>MAY.</HEAD>
<P><HI>May</HI> expresses <HI>possibility</HI> or <HI>liberty,</HI> and properly be∣longs to the present tense of the potential mode. It denotes possibility; as, "I may go perhaps, but it is uncertain;" or it denotes liberty; as, "Master tells me that I may go;" and it is always absolute or unconditional.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="verb">
<HEAD>CAN.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Can</HI> expresses <HI>power</HI> solely; as, "I can go, if I please." It belongs to the present tense of the po∣tential mode, and is always absolute or unconditional.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="verb">
<HEAD>SHOULD.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Should</HI> has various uses. It belongs to all tenses indifferently, and signifies obligation, event or de∣termination. In the first person, should, without emphasis, expresses event conditionally; as, "I should go, if it did not rain." With emphasis, it expresses obligation; as, "my friend is in distress, and I <HI>should</HI> help him." In the second and third persons it expresses obligation without emphasis; as, "you saw your freind in distress and should have relieved him." He saw, &amp;c. But with emphasis, it expresses the resolution of the speaker; as, "had I been there, he <HI>should</HI> have gone at all events;" im∣plying a right in the speaker to command him. But
<PB N="29" REF="018871_0028_0FA8214CCD088470"/>
<HI>should</HI> especially in the first person plural, is often used to express obligation without emphasis.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="verb">
<HEAD>WOULD.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Would</HI> in the first person, without emphasis, is used to express a promise or intention conditionally; as, "I would go, if I had a horse." With emphasis, it imports a resolution of the speaker, which upon certain conditions, he was determined to carry into effect; as, "I <HI>would</HI> have gone, had I been in your place." In the second and third persons, without emphasis, it denotes intention or inclination or even event conditionally; as, "you would purchase, if you were able." With emphasis, it carries an idea of the settled purpose or determination of the person spoken of; as, "he <HI>would</HI> rule, if he could;" in which case <HI>could</HI> is also emphatical.</P>
<P><HI>Would</HI> in the second and third persons is also used to denote the certainty of an event which depended on the will of another person, who, unless some cir∣cumstances had prevented, would surely have carri∣ed his purpose into effect; as, "you <HI>would</HI> have gone, if I had had the care of you." "He, <HI>would</HI> behave better, if his master were present."</P>
<P>In this phrase "I would advise my friend to accept of the offer," there is no condition expressed, but the sense evidently implies one. If I mean to give my advice absolutely, I express myself thus, "I ad∣vise or do advise him;" but "I would advise," im∣plies a condition that "if I were a proper person," or "if my advice were asked," then, &amp;c. But <HI>would</HI> has, in many cases, usurped the place of <HI>do</HI> and is used to express a positive declaration; I think im∣properly; as when a person is asked if he will drink a glass of wine and he replies, "I <HI>would</HI> not chuse any." He means absolutely, "he <HI>does</HI> not chuse any" and absurdly uses a conditional form of ex∣pression.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="verb">
<PB N="30" REF="018871_0029_0FA8214D8CBFBF88"/>
<HEAD>MIGHT.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Might</HI> is derived from <HI>may,</HI> but differs from it in this; <HI>may</HI> is an unconditional declaration of possi∣bility or liberty; <HI>might</HI> expresses the same possibility or liberty under a condition, which defeats the ef∣fect; as, "I might go, if my master would permit." It is used in both the present and past tenses. In the present tense it is always conditional; as in the foregoing example. In the past tense, it is either absolute or conditional: <HI>Absolute;</HI> as, "I might have gone then, but had no inclination;" <HI>condition∣al</HI>; as, "I might have gone, if business had not de∣tained me."</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="verb">
<HEAD>COULD.</HEAD>
<P>The same observations apply to <HI>could,</HI> which is derived from <HI>can</HI> and expresses the power of doing an action. In the present tense it is always con∣ditional; in the past tense, either absolute or con∣ditional.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="verb">
<HEAD>MUST.</HEAD>
<P>This auxiliary denotes necessity. It has no variation, but is used in almost all tenses of the potential mode.</P>
<P>Some Grammarians, if not all, have used <HI>might, could, would,</HI> and <HI>should,</HI> as signs of the imperfect tense only of the subjunctive mode and made little or no difference between the subjunctive and poten∣tial. In both these particulars they appear to me to be inaccurate. The foregoing auxiliary signs are more frequently used in the present tense than in the imperfect. In the present tense they are always conditional—in the past tense either absolute or con∣ditional, according to the nature of the sentence. "I might go, if I had a horse" is present time and conditional; "I might not go yesterday, but may go to day," are absolute declarations; the first in the past time and the last in the present.</P>
<P>In the subjunctive mode they are also used as signs of the imperfect tense; as, "I told him that I could
<PB N="31" REF="018871_0030_0FA8214EE472BBF8"/>
go; you said that I might go, &amp;c." As to a dis∣tinction between the potential and subjunctive modes, it appears to me as real and important, as any dis∣tinction in Grammar. Whenever there is a decla∣ration that something is or is not so, it is called the indicative mode. When there is a declaration, not that an action is done or not, but that there is a power, liberty &amp;c. of doing it, it is called with pro∣priety the potential mode. These modes are inde∣pendent of all others and may stand alone, except the conditional tenses of the potential, which have a necessary connexion with some other mode, which is usually the subjunctive. But the subjunctive mode, is always dependent either on some conjunc∣tion or some preceding verb The dependence of the modes upon each other may be thus explained.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="examples">
<P>1. The absolute tenses of the potential mode may stand alone; but when they have any connexion with another mode, they are preceded or followed by an absolute declaration in the indicative mode, or a doubtful tense of the subjunctive.</P>

<P>2. The conditional tenses of the potential, always im¦ply a subjunctive, though it is very often omitted. But if they are preceded or followed by any verb, it must be by a conditional tense of the potential, or hypothetical tense of the subjunctive.</P>

<P>These are invariable rules; as will appear by unit∣ing

the absolute tenses with the conditional. Thus "I can write, but I would not;" "I can write, if I pleased;" "I could write, if I please," are evident improprieties. It is true we say, "I could write, but I will not," but here is a condition implied; viz. "I could write <HI>if I pleased;</HI> but I will not."</P>
<P>It must be further observed that when I speak of the conditional tenses of the potential, I do not mean that the condition is contained in this mode; for, <HI>might, would, could,</HI> and <HI>should,</HI> are all absolute, unless they are rendered conditional by some phrase in the subjunctive mode, either expressed or understood.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>INTERROGATIVE SENTENCES.</HEAD>

<P><HI>Would</HI> never asks questions in the first person. It is sometimes used by way of echo, when we repeat a question asked by another; as, "would you pur∣chase that lot of goods?" The person not distinctly hearing the question, repeats it, <HI>would I?</HI> But this is an affront both to grammar and to good manners.</P>
<P><HI>Would you write?</HI> is both present and past time; but most commonly present, it refers to the inclina∣tion of the person addressed, provided he were in the place of the person speaking, or in some other particular circumstances, and is answered by a con∣ditional promise, <HI>I would;</HI> that is, "if you were in my situation, <HI>would you sell your house?</HI>" The answer is, "if I were in your situation, <HI>I would, or would not sell my house.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Would he write?</HI> refers to the inclination of a third person, upon condition he were in certain circum∣stances. It supposes the person enquired of, knows what the inclination of the person spoken of, would be under those circumstances; and his answer, grounded upon that supposition, is expressive of the event of that disposition, <HI>he would.</HI></P>

<DIV3 TYPE="verb">

<P><HI>Should I write?</HI> This enquires whether it is my duty to write, either positively or conditionally; and is answered by <HI>you should,</HI> which, without em∣phasis, always expresses obligation.</P>

Without emphasis it enquires concerning an event merely and is answered by <HI>I should,</HI> which declares what my conduct would be under certain circum∣stances. But with emphasis it either expresses a stronger assurance of an event, or a person's obli∣gation; in which case, the answer is also emphatical.</P>
<P><HI>Should he write?</HI> without emphasis, refers mere∣ly to the obligation of the person, and the answer is declaratory of that obligation, <HI>he should.</HI> But with emphasis, it refers to the determination of another per∣son, which is expressed by an emphatical answer, <HI>he should.</HI></P>

<P>N. B. Some Grammarians, particularly Mr. Buchanan, have placed this tense in the subjunctive mode; but with what propriety, I cannot conceive. It is as positive, unconditional a declaration, as any expression in the language; and appears to belong to the indicative mode, as much as the future simple or any other tense.</P>

<P>Some writers upon this subject, have introduced this form of expression, "I might <HI>have had</HI> learned," as a pluperfect of the potential mode; a phrase that does not belong to the language, and I presume, is found in a few Grammars only: There being no possible case in which the same word can be used as an auxiliary twice in the same phrase.</P>

<HEAD>SUBJUNCTIVE MODE.</HEAD>
<P>This mode is used to express something of a doubt∣ful, contingent, or indeterminate nature. It is al∣ways preceded by some other verb on which it has dependence; or by some conjunction, implying <HI>condition, supposition,</HI> &amp;c. as, <HI>if, unless, though, whether, lest</HI> or <HI>except.</HI> Its tenses seem to require a curious distinction which I have never seen sufficiently il∣lustrated. Whenever we speak of a matter of cer∣tainty, we use the indicative mode after any of the foregoing conjunctions. For example, "<HI>though</HI> Ar∣nold <HI>was</HI> an American by birth, yet he betrayed his country." Here is no doubt with respect to the fact; we therefore use the indicative mode <HI>was,</HI> after <HI>though.</HI> But when there is any doubt or condition with respect to the fact, we use the subjunctive mode; as, "though he <HI>slay</HI> me yet will I put my trust in him." Job xiii.15. Here is a condition implied; it would therefore be improper to use the indicative, "though he <HI>slays</HI> me, &amp;c. But in this
<PB N="41" REF="018871_0040_0FA82159C562AD68"/>
mode we use another tense, which has not been no∣ticed; and which implies the supposition of a fact di∣rectly the reverse of what is mentioned. That is, an affirmative sentence amounts to a full declaration in the negative; and a negative sentence implies a declaration or confession of the affirmative. Thus, "if I were in Charlestown," supposes I am not in Charlestown; but, "if I were not in Hartford," im∣plies a full certainty that I am in Hartford. This tense which, in principal verbs, is the same as the imperfect of the indicative mode, I shall denominate <HI>hypothetical;</HI> the other, the doubtful tense.</P>
<P>When we speak of a fact certain in our own minds or granted by all parties, we use the indicative; as, "if I <HI>am</HI> writing, it is not your concern."</P>
<P>When we speak of a doubtful matter, we use the subjunctive mode; "if I be writing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At least this was formerly the case. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seems to be now custom∣ary to use the i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tive to express a doubt; and probably custom will in time get the better of the ancient rules of propriety and banish the doubtful tenses of the subjunctive mode from the lan∣guage. We say, <HI>if he is, if you are,</HI> in cases of uncertainty, and <HI>you be, I be,</HI> in declaratory phrases. This is however an error and a real misfortune to the language, because it destroys a dis∣tinction that is essential and ought to be preserved.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>When we speak of a fact which we allow is not so, but if it were, we want to inform what the consequence would be, we use the imperfect tense of the indicative mode; as, "if I were writing;" or rather, "if I <HI>wrote</HI> as well as you do, I should think myself an excellent penman." This phrase thus used, becomes present time and belongs to the sub∣junctive mode. This perhaps will hardly be admit∣ted; and yet it is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> much used as any in the language. The phrases, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld go, if it <HI>did</HI> not rain;" "I would walk, if I <HI>were</HI> not lame;" "I would ride, if I <HI>had</HI> a horse;" "if he <HI>attended</HI> to his studies, he would make a figure, in the literary world;" are as frequent as any in the language;
<PB N="42" REF="018871_0041_0FA8215A4A380720"/>
they are evidently present time and deserve a sepa∣rate place in Grammar. It is needless to enquire how this came to be the case or to object to its pro∣priety. Custom is sovereign in the use of language; and when universal invariable custom has introduced and established any form of expression, we may pos∣sibly doubt its analogy to the rules of other languages, but ought not to scruple its propriety in our own.</P>

<P>This tense is preceded or followed by the condi∣tional form of the potential; as, "if I learned as fast as he does, I <HI>should be</HI> as great a scholar."</P>
<P>This same form of expression, which is used as a hypothetical tense in present time, is also used as the imperfect tense doubtful. For example, "if I <HI>learned</HI> wit when young, I shall be prudent in old age." This is evidently past time and implies uncer∣tainty. That it is a distinct form of expression from the present hypothetical, is evident from this con∣sideration, that it is attended with an absolute decla∣ration;
<PB N="43" REF="018871_0042_0FA8215CB844ADA8"/>
whereas the hypothetical is always attended with a conditional declaration. Thus, "if I learned as fast as you do, I <HI>should</HI> be a scholar," is hypotheti∣cal; but "if I learned when young, I <HI>shall</HI> be wise in old age," is doubtful. The first is attended with a conditional sign, <HI>should;</HI> the last with a positive declaration, <HI>shall.</HI></P>
<P>The same distinction of <HI>doubtful</HI> and <HI>hypothetical,</HI> runs through all the several modes of expressing power, liberty, obligation, &amp;c. The auxiliaries <HI>may, can, must,</HI> form the doubtful tenses; and <HI>might, would, could,</HI> and <HI>should,</HI> the hypothetical.

<P>This tense, in the affirmative form, supposes that I have not learned and in the negative form, supposes that I have learned. It is always followed by the
<PB N="45" REF="018871_0044_0FA8215E72D39CA8"/>
conditional tenses of the potential mode; as, "if I had learned wit when young, I <HI>should be</HI> more pru∣dent." "If I had not read Virgil when young, I <HI>would</HI> read him now." The first is affirmative and supposes that I did not learn wit when I was young; the last is negative and supposes I did read Virgil when I was young.</P>
<P>This same tense, when followed by a positive declaration, is used as a pluperfect; as, "though he had learned to read, yet he was no penman." But this implies a certainty or concession of the fact, and seems rather the indicative mode.</P>
<P>The foregoing past tense refers to a fact merely; but when there is a reference to the <HI>liberty, power, inclination, necessity</HI> or <HI>obligation,</HI> to do an action, it is expressed by the past tense of the potential mode, subjoined to a conjunction.</P>

<P>This tense signifies, that upon condition, at a cer∣tain future time, an action shall be past, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Both futures are followed by conditional forms of expression.</P>
<P>Note, The conjunction is very often omitted and the nominative placed after the verb or auxiliary; as, "were I present," instead of, "if I were present;" "had I been learned," instead of, "if I had been learned." This is a common mode of expression and by no means in elegant.</P>
<P>In the inflection of the foregoing regular verb, the several combinations of auxiliaries have been deline∣ated, and their uses explained. But it has been re∣marked before, that <HI>be, do</HI> and <HI>have</HI> are often princi∣pal verbs; the first intransitive and the two last, transitive; for which reason it is necessary to decline them at large, in all modes and tenses.</P>
<P>The English not having any passive verb, make use of the verb <HI>be,</HI> joined with the participle in <HI>ed,

en, t,</HI> or <HI>ght,</HI> derived of transitive verbs, or what has been called the passive participle; which form of expression precisely answers to the Latin and Greek passive verb.

<P>The remarks made under the subjunctive of <HI>be</HI> and <HI>do,</HI> with respect to the doubtful and hypothetical forms of <HI>power,</HI> &amp;c. apply to this verb.</P>
<P>In the foregoing analysis of verbs in the Subjunc∣tive mode, I have explained them according to their usual sense, when preceded by the conjunction <HI>if.</HI> But when preceded by other conjunctions, the phrases vary their meaning according to the purport of the conjunction. The difference however is im∣material and will lead into no sensible errors.</P>
<P>With respect to the auxiliaries, it is to be further observed, that <HI>have</HI> is used only before the participles ending in <HI>ed, t,</HI> or <HI>n. Be</HI> is used before all participles. All the other auxiliaries are used only before the verb in its original form; and the past time will ad∣mit no preceding auxiliary. For example.</P>

<P>Here it is observable that <HI>may, can, &amp;c.</HI> are em∣ployed before the present tense <HI>do</HI> or the verb in its
<PB N="56" REF="018871_0055_0FA82166716BCB60"/>
original form. The past time <HI>did</HI> admits no auxiliary. The participle <HI>done</HI> is used after <HI>have</HI> and <HI>be,</HI> but <HI>be</HI> only is used with <HI>doing.</HI></P>
<P>When an auxiliary is joined to a verb, the auxilia∣ry only is varied; as, "I <HI>shall</HI> do, thou <HI>shalt</HI> do," &amp;c.</P>
<P>When two or more auxiliaries are joined to a verb, the first auxiliary only is varied; as, "I <HI>have</HI> been learned, thou <HI>hast</HI> been learned," &amp;c.</P>
<P>Intransitive verbs will very seldom admit of the passive form; in some instances they will—and when this is the case, the participle, joined with the aux∣iliary <HI>be,</HI> becomes a mere adjective, and the verb is intransitive; as, "I am fallen, I am grown," &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>IRREGULAR VERBS.</HEAD>
<P>All English verbs that make the past time and par∣ticiple in <HI>ed,</HI> are accounted regular: All that vary from this rule may be called irregular. I shall rank the whole of our irregular verbs under three heads; first those that make the present tense, past and par∣ticiple all alike; as,

</TABLE></P>
<P>Of this kind are the following: beat, burst, cast, cost, cut, heat, hit, knit, let, put, read, rent, rid, set, shed, shred, shut, slit, split, spread, thrust, wet.</P>
<P>The addition of <HI>ed</HI> after <HI>d</HI> or <HI>t,</HI> would render the sound of the word disagreeable; as, <HI>hitted, putted, &amp;c.</HI> for which reason it is omitted.</P>
<P>Note, <HI>Beat</HI> sometimes makes <HI>beaten</HI> in the parti∣ciple, and <HI>heat, heated.</HI></P>

<P>For the rules of forming regular participles, both in <HI>ed</HI> and <HI>ing,</HI> see pages eighth and ninth.</P>
<P>Here let it be again observed that no auxiliaries can with propriety be joined with the past time. The expressions, <HI>I have wrote, I have bare, I have be∣gan, I have drove,</HI> &amp;c. which are so much in vogue, are shocking improprieties: The childish phrases, <HI>you am, I is,</HI> &amp;c. are not more repugnant to the rules of Grammar.</P>
<P>And yet men of the first reputation, will indulge fashionable errors, which they know have a tenden∣cy to embarrass a language built on the simplest prin∣ciples, and eventually to destroy all rules of analogy. An ancient Roman would be startled to hear a Latin Grammarian use <HI>ille fuit amatus est</HI>▪ a Frenchman, to hear, <HI>il a punit</HI>—and the most unlettered English∣man would laugh to hear another say, <HI>he has went,</HI> or <HI>it will be gave;</HI> and yet, <HI>I have wrote, have drove,</HI> &amp;c. which are quite as improper, have become so familiar to our ears, that we can every hour hear them uttered by some of our best Grammarians without a smile of ridicule. <HI>I have written, have driv∣en,</HI> &amp;c. are as easy to be learned and employed as the past tense <HI>wrote</HI> and <HI>drove;</HI> and it is inexcusable to sacrifice propriety to any consideration whatever.</P>
<P>As no abuses of language are more frequent than those of joining our auxiliaries <HI>have</HI> and <HI>be,</HI> wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h the past tense of our irregular verbs, I will set an exam∣ple in all modes and tenses.</P>

<P>To a verb; as, "he reads <HI>properly,</HI> you run <HI>slowly;</HI>" here <HI>properly</HI> and <HI>slowly</HI> are adverbs, modifying the verbs, <HI>read</HI> and <HI>run.</HI></P>
<P>To an adjective; as, "the boy is <HI>very</HI> studious;" here <HI>very</HI> is an <HI>adverb,</HI> pointing out the degree of studiousness.</P>
<P>To another adverb; as, "I heard <HI>very attentively;</HI>" here <HI>very attentively</HI> are <HI>adverbs; attentively</HI> shows the <HI>manner</HI> in which I heard, viz. with attention; and <HI>very</HI> expresses the degree of that attention.</P>
<P><HI>Have adverbs any variation?</HI> A few only are varied, like adjectives, to express degrees of comparison; as, <HI>soon, sooner, soonest; often, oftener, oftenest▪ well, better, best.</HI></P>
<P>Adverbs which are derived of adjectives, and re∣spect the qualities of things, may all be compared by <HI>more</HI> and <HI>most</HI>; as, <HI>wisely, more wisely, most wisely.</HI></P>

never, now, often, perhaps, rather, seldom, then, thence, there, very, when, where, whether whilst, yes, yesterday.</P>
<P>All adjectives may be made adverbs, by adding <HI>ly:</HI> as, honest, honestly<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We are apt to use adjectives instead of adverbs, as in the fol∣lowing expressions; "extreme cold; exceeding fine; indiffer∣ent well;" all which are very improper and ungrammatical.

<P>N. B. The nominative to a verb is found by asking a question, who or what? Example: "A clear conscience, which we ought carefully to pre∣serve, in every station of life, and which will secure to us a perpetual source of inward tranquillity, will also be our principal guard against the abuses of ma∣levolence.." Here the question occurs, what will be our guard? &amp;c. the answer is, a clear <HI>conscience;</HI>
<PB N="68" REF="018871_0067_0FA821724ED38070"/>
which is therefore the nominative word to the verb <HI>be.</HI> The noun to which an adjective refers, is found in the same manner. Example: "A man in office, to whom some important trust is committed, ought to be exceedingly cautious in his behaviour." Ask the question, who ought to be <HI>cautious</HI>? the answer is, a <HI>man</HI> in office; <HI>man</HI> therefore is the noun, to which the adjective <HI>cautious</HI> refers.</P>

For example; "The western limit of the United States ex∣tends along the middle of the river Missisippi, <HI>to where</HI> it intersects the thirty-first degree of north latitude;" that is, to the <HI>place where.</HI> But the phrase is by no means elegant.</P>
<P>Note further, that prepositions are often placed af∣ter verbs and become a part of them; being es∣sential to the meaning. Thus, in the phrases, <HI>to fall on, to give over, to cast up</HI> (an account) the particles <HI>on, over, up,</HI> are essential to the verbs to which they are annexed, because on them depends the meaning of the phrases. This sort of verbs is purely Saxon and they seem to be growing into disuse; but they are often very significant and their place cannot always be sup∣plied by any single word.</P>

<P>It may also be remarked in general, that senten∣ces ought not to close with <HI>adverbs, relatives,</HI> or <HI>particles.</HI> Little unimportant words; as, <HI>to, for, with, it,</HI> &amp;c. close a period without force and leave a feeble impression upon the mind.

<HEAD>REDUNDANCY of WORDS.</HEAD>
<P>It has been remarked, in the first part of this In∣stitute, that the present English language is derived principally from two sources, the Saxon and the Roman; the Saxon words forming the language of the common people; and the Roman, the learn∣ed and sublime style. For this reason, we may ob∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erve

that, to express the same idea, we have at lest two words, the one of Saxon, and the other of Roman original. That this is the case with respect to the common ideas of mankind, will appear from the following comparison.</P>

<P>The words, <HI>veracitas, conversatio</HI> &amp;c. in the La∣tin language, conveyed the same ideas as <HI>truth, talk</HI> &amp;c. in the Saxon and in the modern English. Where the Latin has not furnished us with a conve∣nient word, we have borrowed from the Greek and French, and sometimes from the modern German. This in one respect is a real advantage to the lan∣guage; as it affords a variety of words to express our ideas, and prevents the necessity of repeating the same words, as was the case with some of the anci∣ent oriental languages. At the same time, it leads ignorant and half-learned people into the frequent and disagreeable use of synonymous terms. Thus we often hear it said that "he is a man of <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>veracity,</HI>" which is saying no more than that he is a man of <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>truth.</HI> In the solemn act of prayer, we often hear the Deity intreated to <HI>keep</HI> and <HI>preserve</HI> us; which, by any explication, will amount to no more than an intercession to <HI>keep</HI> and <HI>keep</HI> us.</P>
<P>The Hebrew language, at the time the scripures
<PB N="113" REF="018871_0112_0FA820E84BA47800"/>
were written, consisted of few words<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is said to consist of about two thousand words. The Eng∣lish contains twenty thousand; besides the singular advantage of composition, which by prefixing to words certain particles and annexing terminations of determinate and known significa∣tions, renders the language capable of an endless variety.</NOTE>, and in or∣der to express ideas with uncommon energy, the writers were obliged to use repetitions. But the, copiousness of our language supersedes the necessi∣ty and consequently the propriety of using two or three synonymous terms to express any idea, how∣ever forcible: And in expressing the common un∣important ideas of mankind, every word that does not add somethig to the meaning of a phrase, must be considered as superfluous and detracting from the beauty of style. To set this impropriety in a striking point of light, I will insert a passage from the Spectator, No. 302, and add a great number of synonymous terms to the original.</P>
<P>"Who ever beheld <HI>and saw</HI> the charming Emi∣lia without feeling in his breast at once the glow <HI>and ardour</HI> of love, and the tenderness of virtuous friend∣ship. The unstudied <HI>and natural</HI> graces of her be∣haviour and the pleasing <HI>and agreeable</HI> accents of her tongue, insensibly <HI>and imperceptibly</HI> draw you on to wish for a nearer enjoyment of them; but even her smiles carry in them a silent reproof to the impulses of licentious <HI>and lawless</HI> love. Thus, though the attractives of her beauty play almost irresistibly up∣on you and create <HI>and give birth to</HI> desire, you im∣mediately stand corrected, not by the severity <HI>and rigour,</HI> but by the decency of her virtue. That sweetness and good humour, which is so visible <HI>and apparent</HI> in her face <HI>and countenance,</HI> naturally dif∣fuses <HI>and spreads</HI> itself into every word and action. A man must be a savage who, at the sight <HI>and view</HI> of Emilia, is not more inclined <HI>and disposed</HI> to do her good than to gratify himself. Her person, as it is
<PB N="114" REF="018871_0113_0FA820E91B1F15B0"/>
thus studiously embellished <HI>and ornamented</HI> by na∣ture, thus adorned with unpremeditated <HI>and unstudi∣ed</HI> graces, is a fit <HI>and proper</HI> lodging <HI>and habitation</HI> for a mind so fair and lovely, <HI>handsome and amiable;</HI> there dwell <HI>and reside</HI> rational piety, modest hope, and cheerful resignation. Were I to relate that part of Emilia's life which has given <HI>and granted</HI> her an opportunity <HI>and occasion</HI> of exerting the he∣roism <HI>and fortitude</HI> of christianity, it would make <HI>and form</HI> too sad <HI>and sorrowful,</HI> too tender <HI>and af∣fecting</HI> a story: But when I consider her done in the midst of her distresses <HI>and sufferings,</HI> looking be∣yond this gloomy <HI>and dark</HI> vale of affliction and sor∣row into the joys of Heaven and immortality, and when I see <HI>and view</HI> her in conversation <HI>and discourse</HI> thoughtless and easy, as if she were the most happy creature in the world, I am transported <HI>and carried away</HI> with admiration <HI>and wonder,</HI>"</P>
<P>In this beautiful description of female excellence, the words in Italics are superfluous: Let them be omitted and we have the passage in the original style, which is pure and elegant.</P>
<P>But it must be remarked that custom has affixed very different meanings to the same words and ve∣ry often different from the original sense. Thus <HI>freedom</HI> is much more general in its signification, than <HI>exemption.</HI> To say a man is <HI>free</HI> from trouble and <HI>exempt</HI> from trouble, is saying the same thing: But the phrase <HI>political exemption</HI> is not admissible; though <HI>political freedom</HI> is as common and proper as any phrase in the language. When therefore I say that two words of the same import ought not to be used at the same time, I would be understood to mean, that they ought not to be used to convey ex∣actly the same idea.</P>
<P>For examples of the needless use of synonymous terms, see Spectator No. 352.</P>
<P>In discourse and familiar writings, I would gene∣rally
<PB N="115" REF="018871_0114_0FA820EA1190EAF0"/>
prefer the Saxon to the Roman words. Ma∣ny of the Saxon words and phrases have a particular force or beauty that is lost in Roman words of cor∣respondent import. But many Saxon words which were used in the time of Spencer and Chaucer are now become obsolete; others are grown vulgar; and the prevailing taste of the English seems to be, to neglect their native tongue in complaisance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the ancient Roman and modern French and Italian.</P>

<P>Many of these compound adjectives, in the sub∣lime style, acquire a beauty and force that would be entirely lost in a circumlocution.

<HEAD>PROSODY or An attempt to investigate the rules of English Verse; with some preliminary observations on Accent and Emphasis.</HEAD>
<P>The precise definition of the terms <HI>accent</HI> and <HI>emphasis,</HI> in our language, seems never to have been settled. This has given rise to various disputes among Grammarians.</P>
<P>Accent has been generally used to signify the pe∣culiar stress of the voice on a particular syllable, in words of more syllables than one: Emphasis, to de∣note the peculiar stress of the voice, on a particular word in a sentence. According to these definitions, no monosyllable can have any accent; and emphasis is limited to one kind.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan, who has taken more pains to regu∣late the pronunciation of the English language, than any other writer, defines accent to be the stress of voice on a particular letter of a syllable, which dis∣tinguishes it from the rest; and confines emphasis to those particular words in a sentence, which de∣mand, not only a greater stress, but a change of tone in the voice.</P>
<P>This definition of accent appears to be more ac∣curate and useful, than the former, especially as it enables us to make, in all words, the necessary dis∣tinction
<PB N="120" REF="018871_0119_0FA820ED8A2B9F58"/>
between accented vowels and accented con∣sonants.</P>
<P>But this is not perfectly accurate; for by this rule, no word consisting of more letters than one, can be unaccented; and he calls the particles <HI>of, at, in, to,</HI> &amp;c. unaccented by mistake; while the pro∣noun <HI>I,</HI> which often requires great stress of voice, without change of note, can have no accent, because it has but one letter.</P>
<P>Perhaps the following definitions may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rly ex∣plain the distinctions.</P>
<P>In every word in the English language, there is some particular letter on which the stress of the voice falls in pronouncing it. This stress of the voice, regulated merely by the rule of pronunciation, I would call <HI>accent.</HI> Emphasis is a stress of voice, regulated only by the sense and importance of the word; but it always falls on the accented letter.</P>
<P>Emphasis is of two kinds; the first I call the <HI>natu∣ral</HI> emphasis, as it is constant and invariable, and de∣pends on the importance of the word with respect to the idea it conveys, without regarding its relation to other words in the sentence.</P>
<P>Thus the words <HI>man, house, strength,</HI> are in their nature important and consequently emphatical in any sentence where they can be placed. They will naturally be pronounced with more force than the particles, <HI>at, of, in,</HI> &amp;c. which instead of being <HI>unac∣cented,</HI> as Mr. Sheridan calls them, are more properly <HI>unemphatical.</HI> All nouns and principal verbs have this emphasis in the highest degree—all adjective<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> participles and adverbs, in a less degree—pronouns though they supply the place of nouns, are generally deprived of emphasis in pronunciation. Conjunc∣tions, interjections, prepositions, auxiliaries and ar∣ticles, are in their nature unemphatical. This kind of emphasis requires no change of tone, but only that natural force of voice with which we pronounce important words.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="018871_0120_0FA820F0B316E738"/>The other kind of emphasis, which is the most forcible, depends merely on the importance of the word on which it falls, in the particular sentence where it is used. It often determines the sense of the phrase, and usually requires a change of tone as well as stress of voice on the accented letter. This emphasis, which may be called <HI>accidental,</HI> being regulated entirely by the sense, may fall on any word in the language and cause particles to be pronounced with the highest stress of voice.</P>
<P>Scarcely any subject has been less attended to than English Prosody. Grammarians have gone no farther than to divide the kinds of verse into the iambic, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and anapaestic, and to distinguish them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> number of syllables in each line. The rule laid down generally for the heroic measure, is, that it consists of five feet and that to make a perfectly regular verse, these ought to be all iambic, with this exception only that the first foot may some∣times be a trochee. All variations from the iambic in the subsequent feet, are considered as defects in the structure of the verse.</P>
<P>These rules have taught all common readers of poetry to affect the placing of the accent or empha∣sis on every second syllable, which makes our versi∣fication thus pronounced, the most monotonous and ridiculous of all poetry in the world. But the truth is, our heroic iambic verse admits of a greater varie∣ty of feet, than the heroic measure of any language with which I am acquainted. The Latin and Greek, as it is well known, admit but two, the dactyl and spondee, except only that the last foot may be a trochee; which however in that place can hardly be perceived by the ear.</P>
<P>In order to explain the nature of English verse, it is necessary to give some rules concerning long and short syllables in our language, which has not yet been attempted on its true principles—the Latin
<PB N="122" REF="018871_0121_0FA820F1E7B89828"/>
prosody having nothing to do with the English lan∣guage.</P>
<P N="1">1st. Every accented syllable is long. This has never been doubted, where the accent falls on a vowel; as, <HI>glo-ry, ho-ly.</HI> Where the accent falls on a consonant, as in <HI>hab-it, bat-tle,</HI> the preceding vowel is undoubtedly short; but the syllable is neverthe∣less long. Thus in the syllable <HI>prac,</HI> the vowel is as short as possible, the syllable being closed by a pure mute consonant; but when we join to it another syllable, if it begin with a consonant; as, <HI>prac-tice,</HI> the time required to place the organs of speech in a position to pronounce the consonants, renders the syllable as long as if the accent lay on the vowel. And if the following syllable begin with a vowel, we cannot avoid joining to it the last consonant, which is the same as doubling the consonant; for the words <HI>hab-it</HI> and <HI>hab-bit</HI> are pronounced precise∣ly alike and in the same space of time. And I ap∣peal to the most accurate ear, whether there be any difference in the ordinary pronunciation of these words <HI>glo-ry, ho-ly, hab-it, prac-tice.</HI></P>
<P>This difference however must be observed, that all accented syllables are not equally long, for all are not equally accented. In many polysyllables, be∣sides the principal accent, there is a weaker accent on another syllable, which may with propriety be called the half accent. Thus in the word <HI>ex-pos-tu-la-to-ry,</HI> the full accent is on the second syllable and the half accent on the fifth; this syllable is longer and more distinctly articulated than the unaccented syllables, though it is not so long as the second, on which lies the principal accent.</P>
<P>The half accent, especially when it follows the full accent, renders such words ungraceful in poetry, except in one single place in the verse; for the half accent may fall gracefully upon the last syllable but two, as in these lines of an anonymous writer:
<Q><PB N="123" REF="018871_0122_0FA820F217A9B188"/>
<L>"A new disgrace inevitably sheds."</L>
<L>"Gives the keen curse accumulated gall."</L></Q></P>
<P>When the half accent precedes the full accent, it is stronger—indeed in many words there are two accents almost equal; as, exaltation, explanation, commutation; and such words, if they exceed not four syllables, are graceful in poetry</P>
<P N="2">2d. Every emphatical syllable is long. This rule applies to all monosyllable nouns and all other mono∣syllables used emphatically. In these lines of Pope's,
<Q><L>"Respecting man, whatever <HI>wrong</HI> we call</L>
<L><HI>May, must</HI> be <HI>right,</HI> as relative to all."</L></Q>
The monosyllables <HI>wrong, right, may, must,</HI> the two former of which being adjectives, are naturally em∣phatical; and the two last which are auxiliaries, and accidentally so—are all important—and in pronun∣ciation are equally long.</P>
<P N="3">3d. All unaccented syllables are, in our language, naturally short. The voice is to dwell on there no longer than is necessary to pronounce distinctly the combination of letters of which they are composed. And although some of them, having more conso∣nants, require more time in pronouncing than others, yet this makes no difference in their use or effect in poetry.</P>
<P N="4">4th. All unemphatical monosyllables are naturally short; as, prepositions, conjunctions, adverbs and articles.</P>
<P>From the foregoing rules, it appears that the move∣ment of our verse is regulated by accent and empha∣sis<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">That the movement of our verse depends not on the length of the vowels, is evident from this; that our longest vowels and diphthongs are often thrown into the shortest place in the line and that without injuring the versification.
<Q><P>"Above, how high, progressive lif: <HI>may</HI> go!"</P>
<BIBL>Pope.</BIBL></Q>
<HI>May</HI> is long, but arbitrarily shortened; <HI>may go,</HI> not forming a spondee.</NOTE>
Whether the accented syllables and emphati∣cal monosyllables are all really long, in the same
<PB N="124" REF="018871_0123_0FA820F318B1E640"/>
sense as syllables are denominated long in the Greek and Roman languages, is a dispute of little conse∣quence. All accented syllables and all monosylla∣bles either naturally or accidentally emphatical, are important—on these depend the dignity and harmo∣ny of verse—and by these, the prosody of our lan∣guage, with all its variety, may be reduced to rules as simple and at the same time as accurate, as those of any other language<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">According to the rules of English prosodians, the mono∣syllables, <HI>strength, health, thrust, thick,</HI> are short syllables; for the vowels are as short as possible. But the fact is, they are some of the longest syllables in the language; and the word <HI>language,</HI> in which there is no long vowel, requires as much time to be pro∣nounced distinctly, as many words of three syllables. In learn∣ing our language, it is of the highest importance to know the long vowels from the short; but in investigating the rules of verse, we are to attend less to the length of the vowels than to that of the syllables, which depends much upon the combination of consonants and the force of utterance.</NOTE></P>
<P>In illustrating the rules of metrical composition, for want of proper types, I shall use figures to repre∣sent the length of the syllables—the long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> impor∣tant syllables, by the figure 1; the short or unim∣portant, by the figure 2. The syllables, which ex∣emplify the rules, are printed in Italics.</P>

strongest accent is on the first syllable: So a mono∣syllable adjective has less emphasis than a noun. A noun and a verb are nearly equal in emphasis natu∣rally, yet the sense will ever determine one to be more emphatical than the other, These ought to be so managed that the most strongly accented sylla∣ble or the most emphatical should be the last of the foot; unless it stand in the first place, where the contrary is equally graceful; as,

<P>To end a line with a trissyllable, the last syllable of which has the half accent or none at all, though sometimes practised by our best Poets, is subversive of all harmony and contrary to the genius of our poetry.</P>
<Q><L>"Th' eternal art, educing good from ill,</L>
<L>Grafts on this passion, our best <HI>principle.</HI>"</L>
<BIBL>POPE.</BIBL>
<L>"The first of men in sovereign <HI>misery.</HI>"</L>
<BIBL>POPE.</BIBL></Q>
<P>In these cases, <HI>y</HI> is made to rhyme sometimes with long <HI>I</HI> and sometimes with long <HI>e,</HI> neither of which is the proper sound of the vowel <HI>y,</HI> in unaccented syllables.</P>
<Q><L>"Blest are the saints who sit on high</L>
<L>Around thy throne of <HI>majesty.</HI>"</L>
<BIBL>WATTS.</BIBL>
<L>"Till a wise care of <HI>piety</HI></L>
<L>Fit us to die and dwell with thee."</L>
<BIBL>WATTS.</BIBL></Q>
<P>It is a pity that such improprieties should be min∣gled with the best productions in the language.</P>
<P>It is to be remarked that the rules given above ap∣ply particularly to rhyme; for in blank verse, a much greater licence may be indulged without injuring the verification.</P>
<P>It would exceed the limits of my design to enter into a particular explanation of the other kinds of English verse; and it is rather unnecessary, as they depend much upon the same principles as the iam∣bic measure.</P>
<P>The trochaic measure, consisting of three, five or seven syllables, the lines beginning with an accented syllable, is but an elliptical form of the iambic; for by prefixing a short syllable to each line, the verse becomes purely iambic; as,
<Q><L><HI>A</HI> "Little Siren of the Stage,</L>
<L><HI>The</HI> "Charmer of an idle age,</L>
<L><HI>An</HI> "Empty warbler, breathing lyre</L>
<L><HI>The</HI> "Wanton gale of fond desire.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="018871_0130_0FA820F8D66611E0"/>In the anapaestic measure, every third syllable is accented, and the multitude of short syllables gives the verse an air of li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eliness, well suited to cheerful subjects; as,
<Q><P>"Not<SUP>2</SUP> a<SUP>2</SUP> pine<SUP>1</SUP> in<SUP>2</SUP> my<SUP>2</SUP> grove<SUP>1</SUP> is<SUP>2</SUP> there<SUP>2</SUP> seen<SUP>1</SUP></P>

<BIBL>SHENSTONE.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Sometimes a syllable is omitted in the first foot; as,
<Q>"Old<SUP>2</SUP> Plato<SUP>1</SUP> <SUP>2</SUP> that<SUP>2</SUP> learned<SUP>1</SUP> <SUP>2</SUP> divine."<SUP>2</SUP> <SUP>1</SUP></Q></P>
<P>An alexandrine is a heroic verse of twelve sylla∣bles and is of the iambic measure; as,
<Q><P>"Who guides the vengeance of mechanic power, To<SUP>2</SUP> blast<SUP>1</SUP>—the<SUP>2</SUP> wa<SUP>1</SUP>—tery<SUP>2</SUP> <SUP>2</SUP> world<SUP>1</SUP>—and<SUP>2</SUP> guard<SUP>1</SUP>—the<SUP>2</SUP> peace∣ful<SUP>1</SUP> <SUP>2</SUP> shore."<SUP>1</SUP></P>
<BIBL>Prospect of Peace.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>With respect to the pauses of our verse, which constitute an essential article, I shall only observe that they are of two kinds; the cesural pause, and the final.</P>
<P>The cesural pause happens in almost every line of heroic verse and after almost every syllable: But it is most graceful after the 4th, 5th, 6th or 7th syllables.</P>
<P>After the fourth; as,
<Q><P>"Know then thyself; presume not God to scan."</P>
<BIBL>POPE.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>After the 5th, 6th and 7th in the following lines;
<Q><L>"Men would be angels, angels would be Gods.</L>
<L>Aspiring to be Gods, if angels fell;</L>
<L>Aspiring to be angels, men rebel."</L>
<BIBL>POPE.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>And it very frequently happens that either the sense or harmony or both require two or more semi-pauses; as,
<Q><L>"To him no high, no low, no great, no small;</L>
<L>He fills, he bounds, connects, and equals all."</L>
<BIBL>POPE.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="018871_0131_0FA820F998105AC8"/>The final pause must be observed at the end of every line, whether there be a stop in the sense or not. Thus in reading these lines
<Q><L>"And who but wishes to invert the laws</L>
<L>Of order, sins against th' eternal cause."</L></Q>
The voice must be suspended at the close of the first line, but not elevated or depressed. And it may be observed that in the second line, there is a pause af∣ter the third syllable.</P>
<P>The nature of the cesural pause is well considere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in Kaim's Elements of Criticism; and the final pause, in Sheridan's Rhetorical Grammar.</P>
<P>To read verse with propriety, let the following rules be observed.</P>
<P N="1">1. All the words should be pronounced just as they are in prose.</P>
<P N="2">2. The voice should bound from accent to accent, and no stress should be laid on unaccented syllables.</P>
<P N="3">3. The emphasis should be observed as in prose.</P>
<P>The pauses, which are marked by the sense, and may be called <HI>sentential,</HI> should be observed as in prose. But the cesural and final pauses, which are designed merely to add harmony to verse, and de∣pend on the structure of it, require only a suspension of the voice without elevation or depression. Where these points are observed in reciting verse, if it then be ungraceful, it is the author's fault, not the read∣er's.</P>

<HEAD>PUNCTUATION. Abridged from Dr. Lowth.</HEAD>
<P>Punctuation is the art of marking in writing the several pauses or rests between sentences and the parts of sentences.</P>
<P>As the several articulate sounds, the syllables and words, of which sentences consist, are marked by letters; so the pauses, between sentences and their parts, are marked by points.</P>
<P>The different degrees of connection between the
<PB N="133" REF="018871_0132_0FA820FA4EB18538"/>
parts of sentences, require a great variety of pauses o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> different lengths; yet, to express this variety, we use only four points. For this reason the doctrine of punctuation must necessarily be imperfect and not reducible to precise rules.</P>
<P>But a few general remarks on this subject may be useful in directing the judgment of the learner.</P>
<P>The points used to make the pauses between sentences and their several parts, are the period, co∣lon, semicolon, and comma. The proportional quantity of time between these may be, as, six, four, two and one.</P>
<P>The period is the whole sentence complete in itself, wanting nothing to make a full and perfect sense, and not connected in construction with a subsequent sentence.</P>
<P>The colon or member, is a chief constructive part, or greater division of a sentence.</P>
<P>The semicolon or half member, is a less construc∣tive part or subdivision of a sentence or member.</P>
<P>A sentence or member is again subdivided into commas or segments; which are the least construc∣tive sense of a sentence or member, in this way of considering it; for the next subdivision would be the resolution of it into phrases and words.</P>
<P>In order the more clearly to determine the proper application of the point which marks it, we must distinguish between an imperfect phrase, a simple sentence, and a compound sentence.</P>
<P>An imperfect phrase contains no assertion, or does not amount to a proposition or sentence.</P>
<P>A simple sentence has but one subject, and one fi∣nite verb.</P>
<P>A compounded sentence has more than one sub∣ject, or one finite verb, either expressed or under∣stood; or it consists of two or more simple sentences connected together.</P>
<P>In a sentence, the subject and the verb may be each
<PB N="134" REF="018871_0133_0FA820FB0F726050"/>
of them accompanied with several adjuncts; as the object, the end, the circumstance of time, place, and manner, and the like : and this, either immediately, or mediately; that is, by being connected with something which is connected with some other; and so on.</P>
<P>If the several adjuncts affect the subject or the verb in a different manner, they are only so many imperfect phrases; and the sentence is simple.</P>
<P>A simple sentence admits of no point by which it may be divided, or distinguished into parts.</P>
<P>If the several adjuncts affect the verb in the same manner, they may be resolved into so many simple sentences; the sentence then becomes compounded, and it must be divided into its parts by points.</P>
<P>For, if there are several subjects belonging in the same manner to one verb, or several verbs belonging in the same manner to one subject, the subjects and verbs, are still to be accounted equal in number: for every verb must have its subject, and every subject its verb; and every one of the subjects or verbs; should or may have its point of distinction.</P>
<P>EXAMPLES.</P>
<P>"The passion for praise produces excellent effects in women of sense." Addison, Spect. No. 73. In this sentence <HI>passion</HI> is the subject, and <HI>produces</HI> the verb: Each of which is accompanied and connected with its adjuncts. The subject is not passion in general, but a particular passion determined by its adjunct of specification, as we may call it, the passion <HI>for praise.</HI> So likewise the verb is immediately connected with its object, <HI>excellent effects</HI>▪ and me∣diately, that is, by the intervention of the word <HI>ef∣fects,</HI> with <HI>women,</HI> the subject in which these effects are produced; which again is connected with its adjunct of specification; for it is not meant of wo∣men in general, but of women <HI>of sense</HI> only. Last∣ly, it is to be observed, that the verb is connected
<PB N="135" REF="018871_0134_0FA820FBEB8C3568"/>
with each of these several adjuncts in a different manner; namely, with <HI>effects,</HI> as the object; with <HI>women,</HI> as the subject of them; with <HI>sense,</HI> as the quality or characteristic of those women. The ad∣juncts therefore are only so many imperfect phrases; the sentence is a simple sentence, and admits of no point, by which it may be distinguished into parts.</P>
<P>"The passion for praise, which is so very vehe∣ment in the fair sex, produces excellent effects in women of sense." Here a new verb is introduced, accompanied with adjuncts of its own; and the sub∣ject is repeated by the relative pronoun <HI>which.</HI> It now becomes a compounded sentence, made up of two simple sentences, one of which is inserted in the middle of the other; it must therefore be distin∣guished into its component parts by a point placed on each side of the additional sentence.</P>
<Q><P>"How many instances have we [in the fair sex] of chastity, fidelity, devotion? How many ladies distinguish themselves by the education of their chil∣dren, care of their family, and love of their husbands; which are the great qualities and atchievements of woman kind; as the making of war, the carrying on of traffic, the administration of justice, are those by which men grow famous, and get themselves a name."</P>
<BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></Q>
<P>In the first of these two sentences, the adjuncts <HI>chastity, fidelity, devotion,</HI> are connected with the verb by the word <HI>instances</HI> in the same manner, and in effect make so many distinct sentences: "How many instances have we of chastity? How many in∣stances have we of fidelity? How many instances have we of devotion?" They must therefore be sepa∣rated from one another by a point. The same may be said of the adjuncts, "education of their chil∣dren, &amp;c" in the former part of the next sentence: as likewise of the several subjects, "the making of war, &amp;c." in the latter part, which have in effect
<PB N="136" REF="018871_0135_0FA820FF052974F8"/>
each their verb; for each of these "is an atchieve∣ment by which men grow famous."</P>
<P>As sentences themselves are divided into simple and compounded, so the members of sentences may be divided into simple and compounded members: for whose sentences, whether compounded or un∣compounded, may become members of other sen∣tences, by means of some additional connection.</P>
<P>Simple members of sentences closely connected together in one compounded member, or sentence, are distinguished or separated by a comma: as in the foregoing examples.</P>
<P>So likewise, the case absolute; nouns in apposi∣tion, when consisting of many terms; the participle with something depending on it; are to be distin∣guished by the comma: for they may be resolved into simple members.</P>
<P>When an address is made to a person; the noun, answering to the vocative case in Latin, is distin∣guished by a comma.</P>
<P>EXAMPLES.</P>
<Q><L>"This sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> he form'd thee, Adam; thee, O man, Dust of the ground."</L>
<L>"Now morn, her rosy steps in th' eastern clime,</L>
<L>Advancing, sow'd the earth with orient pearl."</L>
<BIBL>Milton.</BIBL></Q>
<P>Two nouns, or two adjectives, connected by a single copulative or disjunctive, are not separated by a point; but when there are more than two, or where the conjunction is understood, they must be distinguished by a comma.</P>
<P>Simple members connected by relatives, and com∣paratives, are for the most part distinguished by a comma, but when the members are short, in com∣parative sentences; and when two members are closely connected by a relative restraining the gene∣ral notion of the antecedent to a particular sense; the pause becomes almost insensible, and the comma is better omitted.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="018871_0136_0FA82100301478C0"/>EXAMPLES.</P>
<Q><P>"Raptures, transports, and extasies, are the re∣wards which they confer: sighs and tears, prayers and broken hearts, are the offerings which are paid to them."</P>
<BIBL>Addison, Ibid.</BIBL>
<P>"Gods partial, changeful, passionate, unjust; Whose attributes were rage, revenge, or lust."</P>
<BIBL>Pope.</BIBL>
<P>"What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a lion?"</P></Q>
<P>A circumstance of importance, though no more than an imperfect phrase, may be set off with a com∣ma on each side, to give it greater force and distinc∣tion.</P>
<P>EXAMPLE.</P>
<Q><P>"The principle may be defective or faulty; but the consequences it produces are so good, that, for the benefit of mankind, it ought not to be extin∣guished."</P>
<BIBL>Addison, Ibid.</BIBL></Q>
<P>A member of a sentence, whether simple or com∣pounded, that requires a greater pause than a com∣ma, yet does not of itself make a complete sentence, but is followed by something closely depending on it, may be distinguished by a semicolon.</P>
<P>EXAMPLE.</P>
<Q><P>"But as this passion for admiration, when it works according to reason, improves the beautiful part of our species in every thing that is laudable; so nothing is more destructive to them, when it is governed by vanity and folly."</P>
<BIBL>Addison, Ibid.</BIBL></Q>
<P>Here the whole sentence is divided into two parts by the semicolon; each of which parts is a com∣pounded member, divided into its simple members by the comma.</P>
<P>A member of a sentence, whether simple or com∣pounded, which of itself would make a complete sen∣tence, and so requires a greater pause than a semi∣colon, yet is followed by an additional part, making
<PB N="138" REF="018871_0137_0FA821005E590718"/>
a more full and perfect sense, may be distinguished by a colon.</P>
<P>EXAMPLE.</P>
<Q><P>"Were all books reduced to their quintessence, many a bulky author would make his appearance in a penny paper: there would be scarce any such thing in nature as a folio: the works of an age would be contained on a few shelves: not to mention millions of volumes, that would be utterly annihilated."</P>
<BIBL>Addison, Spect. No. 124.</BIBL></Q>
<P>Here the whole sentence is divided into four parts by colons: the first and last of which are compound∣ed members, each divided by a comma; the second and third are simple members.</P>
<P>When a semicolon has preceded, and a greater pause is still necessary; a colon may be employed, though the sentence be incomplete.</P>
<P>The colon is also commonly used, when an exam∣ple, or a speech is introduced.</P>
<P>When a sentence is so far perfectly finished, as not to be connected in construction with the following sentence, it is marked with a period.</P>
<P>In all cases, the proportion of the several points in respect to one another, is rather to be regarded, than their supposed precise quantity, or proper office, when taken separately.</P>
<P>Beside the points, which mark the pauses in dis∣course, there are others which denote a different modulation of the voice in corresponding with the sense. These are

<P>The interrogation and exclamation points are suf∣ficiently explained by their names: they are inde∣terminate as to their quantity or time, and may be equivalent in that respect to a semicolon, a colon, or a period, as the sense requires. They mark an ele∣vation of the voice.</P>
