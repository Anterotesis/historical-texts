<HEAD>A Narrative &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Thursday August</HI> 14. 1746.</P>
<P>I Left <HI>Fort-Shirley</HI> in Company with Dr. <HI>Williams,</HI> and about fourteen of the Soldiers; we went to <HI>Pelham-Fort,</HI> and from thence to Capt. <HI>Rice</HI>'s, where we lodged that Night.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> 15. We went from thence to <HI>Fort-Massa∣chusetts,</HI> where I design'd to have tarried about a Month.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday</HI> 16. The Dr. with fourteen Men went off for <HI>Deerfield,</HI> and left in the Fort Serjeant <HI>John Hawks,</HI> with twenty Soldiers, about half of them sick with the bloody Flux : Mr. <HI>Hawks</HI> sent a Letter by the Dr. to the Captain, supposing that he was then at <HI>Deerfield,</HI> desiring he would speedily send up some Stores to the Fort, being very short on it for Ammunition, &amp; having discovered some Signs of the Enemy; but the Letter did not get to the Captain seasonably. This Day also two of our Men being out a few Miles distant from the Fort, discovered the Tracks of some of the Enemy.</P>
<P><HI>Lord's-Day &amp; Monday</HI> 17, 18. We met with no Disturbance, nor did we discover any Enemy; but the Sickness was very distressing, for tho' some began to amend, yet there were more taken sick; eleven of our Men were sick, and scarcely one of us in perfect Health,
<PB N="4" REF="006211_0003_10280BB439C8D4D8"/>
almost every Man was troubled with the Griping and Flux.</P>
<P><HI>Tuesday</HI> 19. Between eight &amp; nine o'Clock in the Morning, when thro' the good Providence of God, we were all in the Fort, twenty two Men, three Women, and five Children, there appeared an Army of French and Indians, eight or nine Hundred in Number, com∣manded by Monsieur <HI>Regand de Vaudrüle</HI>; who hav∣ing surrounded the Fort on every Side, began with hideous Acclamations to rush forward upon the Fort, firing incessantly upon us on every Side. Mr. <HI>Hawks</HI> our Officer, ordered that we should let them come without firing at all at them, until they should approach within a suitable Distance, that we might have a good Prospect of doing Execution. We suffered them to come up in a Body 'till they were within twenty Rods of us, and then we fired; upon which the Enemy soon betook themselves to Trees, Stumps &amp; Logs; where they lay and fired incessantly upon us, some taking Opportunity to run from one Tree and Stump to another, and so drew nearer to the Fort: This they did in a very subtil Manner, running so crooked, that it was very difficult to shoot at them with any good Prospect of Success, until we observed that when they came to a Stump, they would fall down; which we observing, prepared to catch them there as they fell down by the Stumps; and this we did probably with Success; for they soon left off this Method. About this Time we saw several of the Enemy fall and rise no more, among which was the Captain of the <HI>St. Francois</HI> Indians, who was one of the foremast, and called upon the rest to press on upon the Fort; Serj. <HI>Hawks</HI> got in Opportunity to shoot him into the Breast, which ended <HI>his</HI> Days.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="006211_0004_10280BF02EEFD2C8"/>At the Beginning of the Engagement, the General sent his Ensign with his Standard (which he standing behind a Tree about thirty Rods distant from the Fort displayed,) the General also walked up the Hill within about forty Rods of the Fort, where he stood, and gave his Orders, but being discovered he had a Shot or two fired at him; upon which he moved off, but presently after comes to his Ensign, where be∣ing discovered, he received a Shot in his Arm, which made him retreat with his Ensign to their Camp. The Enemy still continued to fire almost incessantly upon us, and many of them crept up within a dozen Rods of the Fort. We were straitned for want of Shot; several of our Men being newly come into the Service, and for want of Bullet Moulds, had not prepared for any long Engagement; and therefore the Serjeant or∣dered some of our sick Men to make Bullets, and another to run some Shot, having Shot-Moulds. This put him upon taking particular Notice of the Ammu∣nition, and he found it to be very short, and therefore gave Orders that we should not fire any more than we thought necessary to hold the Enemy back, unless when we had a very good Opportunity and fair Pros∣pect of doing Execution; so that we fired but lit∣tle. We had sometimes very fair Shots, and had Success; we saw several fall, who we are per∣swaded never rose again: We might have shot at the Enemy almost any Time in the Day, who were in open view of the Fort, within fifty or sixty Rods of the same, and sometimes within forty and less, the Officers sometimes walking about Sword in Hand, viewing of us, and others walking back &amp; forth as they had Oc∣casion, without Molestation, for we dare not spend our
<PB N="6" REF="006211_0005_10280BB773077618"/>
Ammunition upon them that were at such a Distance. Towards Evening the Enemy began to use their Axes and Hatchets; some were thoughtful that they were preparing Ladders in order to Storm the Fort in the Night; but afterward we found our Mistake, for they were preparing Faggots in order to burn it. This Day they wounded two of our Men, <HI>viz. John Aldrich</HI> they shot thro' the Foot, and <HI>Jonathan Bridgman</HI> with a Flesh Wound the back Side of his Hip. When the Evening came on, the Serjeant gave Orders that all the Tubs, Pails and Vessels of every Sort, in every Room, should be filled with Water, and went himself to see it done; he also looked to the Doors, that they were made as fast as possible: He like wise cut a Pas∣sage from one Room to another; that he might put the Fort into as good a Posture of Defence as might be, in Case they should attempt to Storm it. He distributed the Men also into the several Rooms: While he was thus preparing, he kept two Men in the Northwest-Mount, and some in the great House the Southeast Corner of the Fort, to Watch the Enemy and keep them back. I was in the Mount all the Evening, it was cloudy and very dark the Beginning of the Evening: The Enemy kept a constant Fire upon us, and as I thought, approached nearer and in greater Numbers than they had in the Day time. We had but little Encouragement to fire upon the Enemy, having nothing but the Light of their Fire to direct us, yet we dare not wholly omit it, lest they should be embolden'd to Storm the Fort: We fired Buck-Shot at them, and have Reason to hope we did some Exe∣cution, for the Enemy complained of our shooting Buck-shot at that Time, which they could not have known had
<PB N="7" REF="006211_0006_10280BB5C52732D8"/>
they not felt some of them. They continued thus to fire upon us, until between eight &amp; nine at Night; and then the whole Army (as we suppose) surrounded the Fort, shouted, or rather yelled with the most hideous Out-cries all round the Fort; this they repeated <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or four Times: We expected they would have fol∣lowed this with a Storm; but were mistaken, for they directly set their Watch all round the Fort; and be∣sides their Watch, they sent some to creep up as near to the Fort as they could, to observe whether any Per∣sons attempted to make their Escape, to carry Tidings to <HI>New-England.</HI> The Body of the Army then drew back to their Camps, some in the Swamp West of the Fort, the other Part to the South-East by the River Side: We then considered what was best to be done, whether to send a Post down to <HI>Deerfield</HI> or not. We looked upon it very improbable, if not morally im∣possible for any Man to get off undiscovered; and therefore the Serjeant would not lay his Commands up∣on any to go, but he proposed it to several, desired and encouraged them, as far as he tho't convenient; but there was not a Man willing to venture out: So the Serjeant having placed the Men in every Part of the Fort, he ordered all the sick &amp; feeble Men to get what Rest they could, and not to regard the Enemies Acclamations, but to lie still all Night, unless he should call for them. Of those that were in Health, some were ordered to keep the Watch, and some lay down, and endeavoured to get some Rest, lying down in our Cloaths with our Arms by us; I lay down the Fore∣part of the Night; we got little or no Rest, the Enemy frequently raised us by their hideous Out-cries, as tho' they were about to attack us; the latter Part of the Night I kept the Watch.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="006211_0007_10280BB925B15A60"/><HI>Wednesday</HI> 20. As soon as it began to be Light the Enemy shouted and began to fire upon us for a few Minutes, and then ceased for a little Time. The Serj. ordered every Man to his Place, and sent two Men up into the Watch-Box: The Enemy came into the Field of Corn to the South &amp; South-East of the Fort, and fought against that Side of the Fort harder than they did the Day before; but unto the Northwest Side they did not approach so near as they had the first Day, yet they kept a continual Fire on that Side: A Num∣ber went up also unto the Mountain North of the Fort, where they could shoot over the North-Side of the Fort into the middle of the Parade: A considerable Number of the Enemy also kept their Axes and Hat∣chets continually at Work, preparing Faggots, and their stubbing Hows and Spades, &amp;c. in order to burn the Fort. About eleven o'Clock <HI>Thomas Knowlton,</HI> one of our Men, being in the Watch-Box, was shot thro' the Head, so that some of his Brains came out, yet Life remained in him for some Hours.</P>
<P>About twelve o'Clock the Enemy desir'd to Parley: We agreed to it, and when we came to General <HI>De Voudriúle,</HI> he promised us good Quarter if we would surrender; otherwise he should endeavour to take us by Force: The Serjeant told him, he should have an Answer within two Hours. We came into the Fort, and examined the State of it: The Whole of our Ammunition we did not judge to be above three or four Pounds of Powder, and not more Lead: And after Prayer unto God for Wisdom &amp; Direction, we considered our Case, whether there was any Probabi∣lity of our being able to withstand the Enemy or not; for we supposed that they would not leave us till they
<PB N="9" REF="006211_0008_10280BF1B7194920"/>
had made a vigorous Attempt upon us; and if they did, we knew our Ammunition would be spent in a few Minutes Time, and then we should be obliged to lay at their Mercy: Had we all been in Health, or had there been only those eight of us that were in Health, I believe every Man would willingly have stood it out to the last; for my Part I should; but we feared, that if we were taken by Violence, the Sick, the Wounded, and the Women, would most, if not all of them die by the Hands of the Salvages, there∣fore our Officer concluded to Surrender on the best Terms he could get: Which were,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. <HI>That we should be all Prisoners to the French, the General promising that the Salvages should have nothing to do with any of us.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. <HI>That the Children should all live with their Pa∣rents during the Time of their Captivity.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>III. <HI>That we should all have the Priviledge of being exchanged the first Opportunity that presented.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Besides these Particulars, the General promised that all the Prisoners should have all Christian Care and Charity exercised towards them; that those who were weak and unable to travel, should be carried in their Journey, that we should all be allowed to keep our Cloathing; and that we might leave a few Lines to inform our Friends what was become of us.</P>
<P>About three of the Clock we admitted the Gene∣ral and a Number of his Officers into the Fort: Upon which he set up his Standard: The Gate was not opened to the rest; the Gentlemen spake com∣fortably to our People; and on our Petition that the dead Corpse might not be abused, but buried; they said, that it should be buried: But the Indians seeing
<PB N="10" REF="006211_0009_10280BBC2EE5A168"/>
that they were shut out, soon fell to pulling out the Underpining of the Fort, and crept into it; opened the Gates; so that the Parade was quickly full: they shouted as soon as they saw the Blood of the dead Corpse under the Watch-Box, but the French kept them down for some Time, &amp; did not suffer them to meddle with it: After some Time the Indians seem'd to be in a Ruffle; and presently rushed up into the Watch-Box, bro't down the dead Corpse, carried it out of the Fort, scalpt it, and cut off the Head and Arms: A young Frenchman took one of the Arms And flay'd it, roasted the Flesh, and offer'd some of it to <HI>Daniel Smeed,</HI> one of the Prisoners, to eat; but he refused it: The Frenchman dressed the Skin of the Arm (as we afterwards heard) and made a Tobacco Pouch of it. After they had plundered the Fort, they set it on Fire, and led us out to <HI>their</HI> Camp.</P>
<P>We had been at the Camp but a little Time, when Mons. <HI>Doty,</HI> the General's Interpreter, called me aside, and desired me to speak to our Soldiers &amp; perswade them to go with the Indians; for he said, the Indi∣ans were desirous that some of them should go with them; and said, that Serj. <HI>Hawks,</HI> myself, and the Families should go with the French Officers. I ans∣wer'd him, that it was contrary to our Agreement, and the General's Promise; and wou'd be to throw away the Lives of some of our Men, who were sick and wounded: He said, no, but the Indians would be kind to them; and tho' they were all Prisoners to the French yet he hoped some of them would be willing to go with the Indians. We spoke to Serj. <HI>Hawks,</HI> and he urged it upon him. We proposed it to some of our Men who were in Health, whether
<PB N="11" REF="006211_0010_10280BF4C9129220"/>
they were willing to go or not, but they were utterly unwilling. I returned to <HI>Doty,</HI> and told him that we should by Means consent that any of our Men should go with the Indians, we took the General to be a Man of Honour; and we hop'd to find him so; we knew that it was the Manner of the Indians to abuse their Prisoners; and sometimes to kill those that failed in travelling, and carrying Packs, which we knew that some of our Men could not do; and we thought it but little better for the General to deliver them to the Indians, than it would be to abuse them himself; and had I tho't that the General would have delivered any of our Men to the Salvages, I should have strenuously opposed the Surrender of the Fort, for I had rather have died in Fight, than to see any of our Men killed, while we had no Op∣portunity to resist. He said, that the General would see, that they should not be abused; and he did not like it that I was so jealous and afraid: I told him, I was not the Officer, but as he spake to me, so I had freely spoken my Mind, and discharged my Duty in it; and he had no Reason to be offended, and I hoped the General would not insist on this Thing, but would make good his promise to all the Prisoners. He went to the General, and after a little Time, the Officers came and took away <HI>John Perry</HI> &amp; his Wife, and all the Soldiers, but Serj. <HI>Hawk, John Smeed</HI> and <HI>Moses Scot</HI> and their Families, and distributed them among the Indians; some French Officers took the Care of the Families, viz. <HI>Smeed's</HI> and <HI>Scot's</HI>; and Mons. <HI>Demuy</HI> took me with him, and <HI>M. St. Luc Lacorn</HI> took Serj. <HI>Hawks</HI> with him; and so we re∣posed that Night, having a strong Guard set over us.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="006211_0011_10280BC0C0846688"/><HI>Thursday</HI> 21. In the Morning I obtained Liberty to go to the Place of the Fort, and set up a Letter, which I did, with a Frenchman and some Indians in Company: I nailed the Letter up on the Well Post. This Morning I saw <HI>Josiah Reed,</HI> who was very weak and feeble by Reason of his long &amp; tedious Sickness; I interceeded with the General for him, that he would not send him with the Indians, but could not prevail; I also interceeded with the General for <HI>John Aldrich,</HI> who being wounded in the Foot was notable to travel; but the Interpreter told me they must go with the Indians, but they should not be hurt; and that they had Canoes a little down the River, in which the Weak and Feeble should be carried: We then put up our Things, and set out on our March for <HI>Crown-Point,</HI> going down the River in <HI>Hoosuck</HI> Road: I was toward the Front, and within about half a Mile. I overtook <HI>John Perry</HI>'s Wife, I pass'd by her, M. <HI>Demuy</HI> travelling a-pace; I spoke with her, and ask'd her, how she did? She told me, <HI>That her Strength failed her in travelling so sast.</HI> I told her, <HI>God was able to strengthen her; in Him she must put her Trust; and I hoped she was ready for whatever God had to call her to.</HI> I had Opportunity to say no more. We went about four Miles to the Place where the Army en∣camped the Night before they came upon us: Here I overtook Neighbour <HI>Perry,</HI> which surprized me, for I tho't he had been behind me with the French, but he was with the Indians. I asked him after his Health, he said, <HI>That he was better than he had been.</HI> I inquired after his Wife, he said, <HI>he did not know where she was; but was somewhere with the Indians:</HI> Which surprized me very much, for I tho't till then
<PB N="13" REF="006211_0012_10280BFBC46EAC90"/>
she was with the French. Here we sat down for a considerable Time: my Heart was filled with Sor∣row, expecting that many of our weak and feeble People would fall by the merciless Hands of the E∣nemy: And as I frequently heard the Salvages shout∣ing &amp; yelling, I trembled, concluding that they then murdered some of our People: And this was my only Comfort, that they could do nothing against us, but what God in his holy Providence permitted 'em; but was fill'd with Admiration when I saw all the Prisoners come up with us, and <HI>John Aldrich</HI> carry'd upon the Back of his Indian Master. We set out again, and had gone but a little Way before we came up with <HI>Josiah Reed,</HI> who gave out: I expected they would have knock'd him on the Head &amp; kill'd him, but an Indian carried him on his Back. We made several Stops, and after we had travelled about eight Miles, we made a considerable Stay; where we re∣freshed our selves; and I had an Opportunity to speak to several of the Prisoners, especially <HI>John Smeed</HI> and his Wife, who being near her Time, was filled with Admiration at the Goodness of GOD in strength∣ning her to travel so far. I saw <HI>John Perry</HI>'s Wife; she complained that she was almost ready to give out; she complained also of the Indian that she went with, that he threatned her. I talked with a French Officer; and he said, that she need not fear, for he would not be allowed to hurt her. Mons. <HI>Demuy</HI> with a Number of Men set out before the Army, and so I took my Leave of her, fearing I should never see her more. After this Serj <HI>Hawks</HI> went to the General, and represented her Case to him; so <HI>he</HI> went and talked to the Indian, and he was kind to her after
<PB N="14" REF="006211_0013_10280BC41C936E00"/>
this. After we had travelled round the Fields, I tho't he was about to leave the River, which increased my Fears; but I found out the Reason, for they only went to look some Buildings to plunder &amp; burn 'em. A little before Sun-set we arrived at <HI>Vandeverickes</HI> Place, where we found some of the Army, who had arriv'd before us, but most of them were still behind; and I had the Comfort to see the greatest Part of the Prisoners come up; God having wonderfully strength∣ned many who were Weak, the French carrying the Women: There were some few that tarried behind about two Miles; where Mrs. <HI>Smeed</HI> was taken in Travail; and some of the French made a Seat for her to sit upon, and bro't her to the Camp; where about ten o'Clock she was graciously delivered of a Daughter, and was remarkably well; the Child also was well; but this Night <HI>Josiah Reed,</HI> being very ill, either died of his Illness, or else was kill'd by the Enemy; which, I never could certainly know, but I fear he was murdered.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> 22. This Morning I baptized <HI>John Smeed</HI>'s Child, he called its Name <HI>Captivity.</HI> The French then made a Frame like a Bier, and laced a Buckskin and Bearskin upon it, and lay'd Mrs. <HI>Smeed</HI> with her Infant thereon; and so two Men at a Time carried them: They also carried <HI>Moses Scot</HI>'s Wife &amp; two Children, &amp; another of <HI>Smeed</HI>'s Children; the Indians also carry'd in their Canoes Br. <HI>Simon</HI> &amp; <HI>John Aldrich,</HI> and <HI>Perry</HI>'s Wife down the River about ten Miles. We had remarkable Smiles of Providence; our Men that had been sick, grew better, &amp; recover'd Strength; the Enemy killed some Cattle, which they found in the Meadows, so that we had plenty of fresh Provi∣ons
<PB N="15" REF="006211_0014_1027DA448FCA1958"/>
and Broth, which was very beneficial to the Sick. I then expressed a Concern for the feeble People, un∣derstanding that we were to leave the River, and travel thro' the Wilderness near sixty Miles; but M. <HI>Demuy</HI> told me I need not fear, for the General had promised those Indians a Reward who had the Care of the feeble Persons, if they would be Kind &amp; carry them thro' the Journey. This Night I visited most of the Prisoners: This Night also died two Indians of their Wounds. The Enemy had got four Horses.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday</HI> 23. This Morning the General sent off an Officer with some Men to carry News to <HI>Canada.</HI> This Day we left the River &amp; travelled in the Wil∣derness in something of a Path, and good travelling for the Wilderness, something East of North, about fifteen Miles, the French still carrying <HI>Smeed</HI>'s and <HI>Scot</HI>'s Wives &amp; Children, the Indians finding Horses for Br. <HI>Simon</HI> &amp; <HI>John Aldrich; Perry</HI> being released from his Pack was allowed to help his Wife, &amp; carry her when she was weary. About three in the After∣noon, they were alarmed by discovering the Tracts of a Scout from <HI>Sarratogo</HI>; this put them into a consi∣derable Ruffle, fearing that there might be an Army after them; but I presumed that they need not be concerned about it; the Body of the Army lodged between two Ponds, but Part with a Number of the Prisoners were sent forward about two Miles 'till they cross'd <HI>Sarratago-River</HI>; it is there 20 Rods wide, but shallow Water. This Night died two more In∣dians of their Wounds.</P>
<P><HI>Lord's-Day</HI> 24. This Day we set out in the Morn∣ing, and came to <HI>Sarratago-River,</HI> cross'd it, and came to our Company, which had been before us;
<PB N="16" REF="006211_0015_10280BC8FB329E08"/>
here we came to a rich Piece of Meadow-Ground, and travelled in it about five Miles: We had good travelling this Day: We cross'd several Pieces of good Meadow-Land: We went about eighteen Miles. <HI>John Perry</HI>'s Wife performed this Day's Journey without Help from any. Our sick &amp; feeble Persons were remarkably preserved to Day; for about two o'Clock in the Afternoon there fell a very heavy Shower of Rain, which wet us thro' all our Cloaths. Mrs. <HI>Smeed</HI> was as wet as any of us, and it being the third Day after her Delivery, we were concerned a∣bout the Event, but thro' the good Providence of GOD she never perceived any Harm by it, nor did any other Person, but <HI>Miriam</HI> the Wife of <HI>Moses Scot,</HI> who hereby catch'd a grievous Cold. This Night we lodg'd in a Meadow, where was a Run of Water, which makes a Part of <HI>Wood-Creek.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday</HI> 25. This Morning we set out and tra∣velled about eleven Miles: We had something rough travelling to Day; we quickly left the small Stream we lodged by at our right Hand to the East of us, and travelling a few Miles over some small Hills and Ledges, came to a Stream running from East to West, about two or three Rods in Width, and about two Feet deep; we cross'd it, our general Course being North; we travelled about two or three Miles farther, and came to a Stream running from South-West to North-East, about six Rods in Width, which we cross'd; and this Stream (which we suppose to be <HI>Wood-Creek</HI>) according to the best of my Remem∣brance, and according to the short Minute that I made of this Day's travel) we left at our right Hand to the East of us; but Serjeant <HI>Hawks</HI> thinks I am
<PB N="17" REF="006211_0016_10280BFD49B6F428"/>
mistaken, and that we cross'd it again, and left it at the left Hand West of us: I won't be certain, but I can't perswade my self that I am mistaken. The French and Indians helping our feeble People, we all arrived well at our Camp, which was by a cou∣ple of Ponds; some few who were before us went to the drowned Land.</P>
<P><HI>Tuesday</HI> 26. This Day we took our Journey; our Course in the Morning something West of North; in travelling about three or four Miles we came to a Mountain a steep Ascent about eighty or a hundred Rods, but not rocky; after we past this Mountain, our Course was about West five or six Miles, 'till we came to the drowned Land: When we came to the Canoes, the Stream ran from North East to South West; we embarked about two o'clock, the Stream quickly turned, and ran to the North; we sailed about 18 or 20 Miles that Night, and en∣camped on the East Side of the Water.</P>
<P><HI>Wednesday</HI> 23. We embarked about nine o'Clock and sailed to <HI>Crown-Point,</HI> something better than 20 Miles; some of the Army went in the Night before, and some before the Body of the Army. The Sails were pulled down, and the Canoes bro't up a-breast and passed by the Fort over to the North East Point saluting the Fort with three Volleys, as we pass'd by it; the Fort returning the Salute by the discharge of the Cannon: This was about twelve o'Clock. Here we tarried 'till the 4th of <HI>September.</HI> I lodged in an House on the North East Point. We all arriv'd better in Health, than when we were first taken.</P>
<P><HI>Thursday</HI> 28. This Day I was invited by Monsieur <HI>Demuy</HI> to go over and see the Fort, which I did:

It is something an irregular Form, having five Sides to it, the Rampers twenty Feet thick, the Breast-Work two Feet &amp; half, the whole about twenty Feet high; there were 21 or 22 Guns upon the Wall, some four &amp; six Pounders, and there may be some as large as nine Pounders; the Citadel an Octagon built, three Stories high, fifty or 60 FeetDiameter, built with Stone laid in Lime, the Wall six or seven Feet thick, arched over the second &amp; third Stories for Bomb-Proof; in the Chambers 9 or 10 Guns, some of 'em may be 9 Pounders, and I believe none less than six, &amp; near 20 Patararoes; but as my Time was short, I can't be very particular: They have Stores of small Arms, as Blunderbusses, Pistols, &amp; Muskets. This Night prov'd very cold and stormy.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> 29. This Morning <HI>Smeed</HI>'s &amp; <HI>Scot</HI>'s Fami∣lies were bro't out of their Tents into the House, that they might be the more comfortable: it rained, and was very cold all the Day, and at Night the Wind was very high.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday</HI> 30. Was something warmer.</P>
<P><HI>Lord's-Day</HI> 31. We had the Liberty of worship∣ping GOD together in a Room by our selves. This Day about 12 o'Clock the Enemy who went off from us from <HI>Hoosuck</HI> the Morning after we were taken, re∣turned and brought in six scalps, viz. <HI>Samuel Allen, Eleazer Hawks,</HI> Jun. two <HI>Amsdell's,</HI> all of <HI>Deedfield, Adonijah Gillet</HI> of <HI>Colchester, Constant Bliss</HI> of <HI>Hebron</HI>; and one Captive, viz <HI>Samuel Allen,</HI> Son to him who was kill'd; he was taken with his Father &amp; <HI>Eliazer Hawks</HI>; the <HI>Amsdells</HI> and <HI>Gillet</HI> were kill'd in <HI>Deer∣field South-Meadow August</HI> 25; the Indians also ac∣knowledged they lost one Man there. This Lad

told us they had not then heard in <HI>Deerfield</HI> of their taking <HI>Fort-Massachusetts</HI>; a young <HI>Hatacook</HI> Indian was his Master, and carried him to <HI>St. Francois.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday Sept.</HI> 1. <HI>Tuesday</HI> 2. <HI>Wednesday</HI> 3. We tarried still at <HI>Crown-Point.</HI> The Weather was some∣thing lowry but warm: I lived with the General and about half a dozen more Officers, who lodg'd in the same House; our Diet was very good, it being chiefly fresh Meat &amp; Broth, which was a great Benefit to me: We had also plenty of <HI>Bourdeaux</HI> Wine, which being of an astringent Nature, was a great Kindness to me (having at that Time something of the Grip∣ing and bloody Flux) While we lay here, we wrote a Letter to the Hon. <HI>John Stoddard,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> at <HI>Northampton,</HI> to give him a particular Account of our Fight and Surrender; as also some other private Letters; the French Gentlemen giving us Encouragement that they would send them down by some of their Scouts, to some Part of our Frontiers, and leave them so that they should be found; but I have not heard of them since, and conclude that they destroyed them.</P>
<P><HI>Thursday</HI> 4. We embarked for <HI>Canada,</HI> about ten o'Clock, and sailed about 15 Miles; our Course I judged to be North about ten Degrees East, which I take to be the general Course from <HI>Crown-Point</HI> to <HI>Champlain.</HI> Towards Night we turned into a Cove the East Side of the Lake, and encamped, having the Land upon the South West South &amp; East of us: Here we were to wait for General <HI>De Vaudriüle,</HI> whom we left at <HI>Crown-Point,</HI> and expected would come to us this Night, or in the Morning; but the Night proved very stormy.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="006211_0019_10280BCD8B96B0A8"/><HI>Friday</HI> 5. The Wind blowing hard from the North, and some Rain, we lay by to Day</P>
<P><HI>Saturday</HI> 6. About nine o'Clock this Morning the General came up with us; then we embark'd and sailed with a pretty good Wind the bigger Part of the Day: Towards Night we saw a few Houses on the West Side of the Lake, but I suppose that they were deserted. We sailed at least three score Miles this Day; we came too where the Lake was but a few Miles in Width, and encamped on the East Shore, where there was a Wind-Mill &amp; a few Houses, but were all deserted.</P>
<P><HI>Lords's-Day</HI> 7. We rose early and set sail as soon as it was fair Day-Light, having a good Wind, but the Wind fell about eight o'Clock, that they were obliged to ply their Paddles. When we came to the End of the Lake about eleven o'Clock, and were entring <HI>Champlain-River,</HI> we met a Boat with three Men in it, who brought a Packet of Letters for the Officers in the Army; they gave one or two to Mons. <HI>Demuy</HI>: After reading the Letters he told me the News he had by them, <HI>viz.</HI> 'That there were a Number of Ships arriv'd from <HI>France</HI> to <HI>Que∣bec,</HI> who had brought them plenty of Stores; that they came in Company with a Fleet of 40 large Men of War from the <HI>Brest</HI> &amp; <HI>Toulon</HI> Squadron, and gave the following Account; that the <HI>English</HI> Fleet having blocked up the <HI>Brest</HI> Squadron in the Harbour, the Admiral of the <HI>Brest</HI> Squadron wrote to the Ad∣mirals of the <HI>Toulon</HI> &amp; <HI>Rochfort</HI> Squadrons to come to his Assistance; who coming on the Back of the English Fleet, and the <HI>Brest</HI> Squadron issuing out at the same Time against them, there ensued a terrible
<PB N="21" REF="006211_0020_10280C04B272B410"/>
Fight, in which the <HI>French</HI> prevailed, and sunk one half of the <HI>English</HI> Ships, and put the rest to Flight, and then they sailed for <HI>North-America</HI>; that the King sent with them 12 Merchant Ships with Stores of Ammunition, Cloathing, Wine &amp; Brandy, and a thousand Soldiers to strengthen <HI>Canada</HI>; that the Men of War were divided into two Fleets, one of which did now block up <HI>Louisbourg,</HI> &amp; were fighting against it; and the other Part of the Fleet was gone for <HI>Boston:</HI> He said that their King was very angry with <HI>New-England</HI> for their taking <HI>Cape-Breton</HI>; and it was probable he would bring them into Subjection: He told me also that they bro't News that <HI>Edward Stuart</HI> the Pretender's youngest Son was in the North of <HI>England,</HI> and had a powerful Army; &amp; that great Numbers of <HI>English</HI> resorted to him daily, &amp; it was probable he would prevail to dethrone King <HI>George.</HI>' I told him that as for <HI>this</HI> and the <HI>Fight at Sea,</HI> I had good Reason to think they were false, for I had News from <HI>England</HI> since the <HI>Brest</HI> Fleet had failed out, and there was no Account of these Things, but the con∣trary. He told me also that Prince <HI>William</HI> the Duke of <HI>Cumberland</HI> was kill'd in Battle at <HI>Culloden-Muir,</HI> and that he was the only Person of the House of <HI>Ha∣nover</HI> which the <HI>English</HI> Nation loved; so that altho' the King's Army got the Victory, yet it was a Loss to his Interest, for the Duke being dead, the <HI>English</HI> Nation would revolt from the House of <HI>Hanover,</HI> be∣ing weary of it, and turn to the House of <HI>Stuart's.</HI>' But I told him, that the <HI>Duke of Cumberland</HI> was yet alive, and as he had been a Scourge &amp; Terror to the King's Enemies, so we had Reason to hope he would still be; he grew warm in his Debate, call'd the King
<PB N="22" REF="006211_0021_1027DA42B8654950"/>
a Usurper, the Nation in bringing of him in, <HI>Cromell's</HI> Faction; and many other Things: Upon which we had a considerable Debate, until he grew more mild, and began to flatter, and told me, what an amiable Man the <HI>Pretender</HI> was, and what good Times it would be if he came to the Throne of <HI>England,</HI> giv∣ing free Liberty of Conscience to all his Subjects, and he did not doubt but that they would return to the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> which was the true Church: Our Children, he believ'd would come to a good Union in Religion.</P>
<P>We went on Shore at the first House about three Miles above the Fort; where they were called toge∣ther, and said their Prayers; and as soon as they had done, Mons. <HI>Demuy</HI> read his Letter; upon which, they all shouted, crying <HI>Vive le Roy:</HI> q. d. <HI>Let the King live.</HI> Upon which, several of the young Men came laughing to me, and by Signs endeavoured to inform me what the News was. I concluded that these fine Tales were framed and sent to meet the Army, in order to keep up the Courage of the com∣mon People and of the Indians, who seemed to re∣pent of their engaging in the War, and to grow very weary of it: Tho' I found afterwards that the <HI>Brest</HI> Fleet was actually come over, with a Design against <HI>New-England.</HI> From thence we travelled down to <HI>Champlain</HI>; where the Gentlemen set up their Tents, and we had great Numbers to visit us of both Sexes: There I expected we should have tarried that Night, but a little before the Sun-setting M. <HI>Demuy</HI> came and ordered his Canoe's Company to embark, &amp; go down the River, and told me, I must go with them, and whatever I stood in Need of, his People would
<PB N="23" REF="006211_0022_10280C063687E660"/>
give me: And indeed I wanted nothing, having good fresh Provisions, and plenty of Wine to drink; but was something surpriz'd at this sudden Remove, and could never know the Reason of it, unless it was this, <HI>viz▪</HI> Some of the French &amp; Indians going out from <HI>Crown-Point</HI> while I lay there, fell on a Number of our Men near <HI>Sarratago</HI>; had killed some &amp; taken some Prisoners, and were come to <HI>Champlain</HI> with one of them; and they wanted to get what News from him they could; and so chose to get me out of the Way, &amp; some others, lest we might give him a Caution; and he really wanted a Caution, for he told them that which he had better have kept to himself, <HI>viz.</HI> the miserable Circumstances of <HI>Sarra∣tago</HI> Fort. We failed down the River about three Miles, and lodged at a poor Man's House, who ac∣cording to his Ability, was courteous to me: I lodged with him in his own Bed; which was the first Bed I had lodged in since my Captivity; and tho' it was a hard Bed, and destitute of Linnen, yet it was very comfortable to me.</P>
<P><HI>Monday</HI> 8. This Morning there came an English∣man to seeme, his Name <HI>Littlefield</HI>: He was taken a Lad from <HI>Piscataqua,</HI> and so continued with the French, and lived, having a Family, at <HI>Champlain</HI>: We had considerable Discourse together. About eight o'Clock we embarked; some Canoes passing down the River on the opposite Side. We sailed over the River, and met with Mons. <HI>Demuy,</HI> &amp; took him in: We sailed down the River about 15 Miles, and dined with a Priest. The Country on <HI>Champlain-River</HI> appeared very poor, it being cold sour Land; it is inhabited on each Side, but the Buildings are
<PB N="24" REF="006211_0023_10280BD44583F4F0"/>
generally but poor Hutts. This Day Mons. <HI>Demuy</HI> tells me another Piece of News, <HI>viz.</HI> 'That one of their Men of War had taken an Englishman of War near <HI>Louisbourg,</HI> after a whole Day's Engagement; that the Blood was Mid-Leg deep upon the Englishman's Deck when he surrendered.' I told him, they fought Courageously: He said, true, but they were taken notwithstanding: He said, they had taken three Hundred &amp; twenty Men out of her, who were com∣ing up to <HI>Quebec,</HI> where I should meet them.' This was nothing but the <HI>Albany</HI> Sloop, one of the Men of War's Tenders, which Governour <HI>Knowles</HI> sent with a Pacquet from <HI>Louisbourg</HI> for <HI>Boston</HI>: There were but seventy Men in her; she was taken by a French Man of War near <HI>Jebucta.</HI> About two o' Clock it began to Rain, and continued a cold Rain all the rest of the Day. We sailed down the River between 30 and 40 Miles, and then carried over our Canoes &amp; Packs across the Land to <HI>St. Lawrence,</HI> which was about three Miles, and we came to it above <HI>Lozel,</HI> and there we lodged that Night in a French House.</P>
<P><HI>Tuesday</HI> 9. This Morning being something lowry, we did not set out very early: The Wind was North∣easterly and pretty high: About nine o'Clock we set Sail up the River for <HI>Mountreal</HI>; it was good sailing; we dined at a French Gentleman's House on the Eastern Shore: There was an Irish Doctor came and dined with us. his Name <HI>O Sullivan:</HI> He pre∣tended a great deal of Respect for me, &amp; Compassion towards all the Prisoners; a great deal of Friendship to the English Nation, and especially for the House of <HI>Hanover</HI>; and he inquired after the State of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and pretended to rejoyce that the <HI>Duke of
<PB N="25" REF="006211_0024_10280C07BAB06618"/>
Cumberland</HI> had got such a Victory over the Pretender and the Rebels; but I presently found he grew weary in hearing the Particulars; and therefore to mortify him the more, I told him all that I could; then we set sail, and went within about five Miles of <HI>Mount-Real</HI>; the Weather was something tedious; and it rained in the Afternoon.</P>
<P><HI>Wednesday</HI> 10 This Morning it rained very hard 'till near ten o'Clock; about which Time the Gene∣ral and some others passed by us, and we embark'd directly upon it, and arrived at <HI>Mount Real,</HI> about twelve o'Clock. Mons. <HI>Demuy,</HI> took me to the Go∣vernour's: He said but little to me; he only told me, that for the Time I tarried at <HI>Mount-Real.</HI> I should keep at Mons. <HI>Demuy</HI>'s, but that after a few Days he must send me, with the rest of the Prisoners, to <HI>Quebec.</HI> I went with Mons. <HI>Demuy</HI> and was courteously en∣tertained by him for the Time I tarried at <HI>Mount-Real</HI>: In the Afternoon came an English Wo∣man to visit me; she was I judged between 60 and 70 Years of Age; she was taken when a Child from <HI>Merrimack-River,</HI> her Name <HI>Hannah Rie</HI>; she had been married to a Frenchman, by whom she had four Children, three Sons &amp; one Daughter; her Daughter was married and had several Children, and came to see me; I saw also one of her Sons; she had been a Widow about 14 Years, but was under very com∣fortable Circumstances. There was another English-Woman came to see me who was taken from the East∣ward, but I have forgot both her Name, and Place where she was taken from.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> 11. This Day I tarried at Mons. <HI>Demuy's</HI>: Where the Major of the Town visited me; he told
<PB N="26" REF="006211_0025_10280BD85BCE7820"/>
me that he married an English Woman whose Name was <HI>Storer,</HI> she was taken when a Child by Indians, from <HI>Piscataqua</HI>; that one of his Sons was down at the taking of us. Mrs. <HI>St. La Germine,</HI> one of his Wife's Cousins, who was also taken with her, came with the Major, and was able to discourse in the English Tongue; she told me that the Reverend Mr. <HI>Storer</HI> of <HI>Watertown</HI> was her Brother, and that she wanted to hear from her Friends; but I was not ac∣quainted with any of them.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> 12. This Day about two o'Clock in the Afternoon, we embarked in Boats, and set out for <HI>Que∣bec,</HI> and sailed down the River about five Leagues: There were all that were taken with me but six Men who were yet with the Indians, and <HI>John Perry's</HI> Wife who was at the Three-Rivers; there were also four Dutch with us, who were taken near <HI>Sarratago.</HI> We lodged in a House upon the North West Side of <HI>St. Lawrence's River.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday</HI> 13. This Day we had a fair Wind, and sail'd down the River twenty five Leagues, when we arrived at the Three-Rivers. We went into an Inn: The General &amp; some others of the Gentlemen which went down with us, presently went out to the Gover∣nor's, leaving only their Soldiers to guard us. And after a little Time the Governor sent for Serj. <HI>Hawks</HI> and me, to come &amp; Sup with him: accordingly we went, &amp; were courteously &amp; sumptuously entertained by him; and while we sat at Supper, the Gentlemen fell into Discourse about the Wars, and about the Wounds they had received; the General's Wound was discours'd upon; and the Governor desir'd Serj. <HI>Hawks</HI> to shew his Scars, which he did. The Gover∣nour
<PB N="27" REF="006211_0026_10280D7F57EC92A0"/>
then inform'd us of a Fight he had been in at Sea in former Wars, in which he received 15 Wounds, and he shew'd us several Scars: This I tho't was a very remarkable Thing, that he should receive so many Wounds, and yet have his Life spar'd. This Night <HI>John Perry's</HI> Wife was also bro't to us, and added to our Number.</P>
<P><HI>Lord's-Day</HI> 14. We set sail, but received little Help from the Wind; the Soldiers were obliged to row the greatest Part of the Day; but at Night the Tide favouring of us, we sail'd 'till 2 or 3 o'Clock in the Morning: We sailed in the Day &amp; Night 23 Leagues; then we went on Shore the N-West Side of the River, &amp; lodged at a House in a small Village.</P>
<P><HI>Monday</HI> 15. This Day we sailed seven Leagues and came to <HI>Quebec</HI>; we were landed at the East Point of the Town, where <HI>St. Lawrence</HI> meets with <HI>Loretto,</HI> and were conducted up by a Number of Sol∣diers thro' the lower Town, to the Governour-Gene∣ral's, where I was taken into his private Room, and he desired me to tell him what News we had in <HI>New-England</HI>; I told him of considerable News we had from <HI>Europe</HI> concerning the Duke of <HI>Cumberland</HI>'s Vic∣tory over the Rebels: He seem'd to have a great Mind to perswade me that the <HI>Duke</HI> was kill'd; but I told him he was alive &amp; well: I told him of several other Pieces of News, but none very good for the French: He told me he had heard that we designed an Ex∣pedition against <HI>Canada</HI>: He asked me what there was in it: I told him that I liv'd at a great Distance from <HI>Boston,</HI> and could say but little about it; I had heard that his Majesty had sent over to some of the Governors in <HI>America,</HI> that he had Tho'ts of an Ex∣pedition
<PB N="28" REF="006211_0027_10280BD9E22ADB50"/>
against <HI>Canada,</HI> and would have them in Readiness to assist him in Case he should send a Fleet over: He inquired what it was that had put it by, something he said was the Matter: I told him, I could not tell; so he seemed to be pretty easy. After this I was conducted to the Lord Intendant's, who inquired also after News both of me and Serj. <HI>Hawks</HI>; after which he gave us a Glass of Wine: Then we were conducted to the Prisoners House, which is a Guard-House standing by a Battery to∣wards the South-West-End of the Town about 150 Feet in Length and twenty in Width, and two Story high; and we made to the Number of 105 Prisoners. Here we had the free Liberty of the Exercise of our Religion together, which was Matter of Comfort to us in our Affliction: Serj. <HI>Hawks</HI> and my self were put into the Captain's Room, where we found three English Masters of Vessels, <HI>viz.</HI> Mr. <HI>Wm. Chapman</HI> of <HI>Maryland,</HI> Mr. <HI>James Southerland</HI> of <HI>Cape-Cod,</HI> and Capt. <HI>William Pote</HI> of <HI>Casco-Bay,</HI> who had all been Prisoners near sixteen Months.</P>
<P><HI>Tuesday</HI> 16. This Day there came some Gentlemen to see me, among whom was Mr. <HI>Joseph Portois,</HI> who understands the English Tongue; and Mr. <HI>Pais,</HI> who Mr. <HI>Portois</HI> told me was his Kinsman, and that he was a Protestant, &amp; came on Purpose to see me, and to shew me a Kindness: He gave me 24 Livres in Cash. From this Time to the 23d there was nothing remarkable happened but only this, that the Jesuits and some unknown Gentlemen, understanding I was short on it for Cloathing, sent me several Shirts, a good Winter Coat, some Caps, a pair of Stockings, and a few Handkerchiefs, which were very acceptable.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="006211_0028_1027DA51692E05D0"/><HI>Tuesday</HI> 23. Capt. <HI>William Pote</HI> was taken ill with the Fever &amp; Flux; <HI>Jacob Reed</HI> was also taken with the same. This Day came into Prison two of our Men who had been with the Indians, viz. <HI>David Warren</HI> and <HI>Pheneas Forbush,</HI> who informed that <HI>John Aldrich</HI> was in the Hospital at <HI>Mount-Real:</HI> They informed us also concerning some other Pri∣soners who were taken from <HI>New-England,</HI> and were with the Indians.</P>
<P><HI>Wednesday</HI> 24. There came into Prison forty three new Prisoners, who were taken at Sea, by a couple of French Men of War; among whom, was Mr <HI>Wm. Lam∣bert,</HI> Master of the Billinder, one of the Men of War's Tenders, who was taken near <HI>Jebucta,</HI> as she was going from <HI>Louisbourg</HI> to <HI>Boston</HI>; &amp; <HI>Zephaniah Pinkham</HI> Master of a Whaling-Sloop from <HI>Nantucket</HI>; &amp; <HI>John Phillips</HI> Master of a fishing Schooner from <HI>Marblehead.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thursday &amp; Friday</HI> 25.26. There came in about 74 Prisoners, all taken at Sea by the aforesaid Men of War, among whom were several Masters of Vessels: This Day there also came in <HI>Jacob Shepherd,</HI> who was taken with me, and had been with the Indians; and one Widow <HI>Briant,</HI> taken the Spring before near <HI>Casco-Bay.</HI> There was nothing further Remarkable in this Month; so that we were by this Time in∣creased to the Number of two Hundred twenty six.</P>
<P><HI>Lord's-Day October</HI> 5. There came in 17 Priso∣ners, <HI>viz.</HI> Three of our Men, <HI>Nath, Hitchcock, Stephen Scot,</HI> and <HI>John Aldrich</HI>; two taken by Indians at the Eastward, <HI>viz Richard Stubs,</HI> &amp; <HI>Pike Gordon</HI>; and twelve from the <HI>Bay Verde.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lord's Day</HI> 12 There came in 24 Men taken at Sea by the <HI>Lazora</HI> and <HI>Le Castore</HI> Men of War.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="006211_0029_10280BDCE1F4B020"/><HI>Wednesday</HI> 22. I sent a Petition to his Lordship the General of <HI>Canada</HI> or <HI>New-France,</HI> to permit me to go home to <HI>New-England,</HI> upon a Parole of Ho∣nour, setting me a suitable Time, and I would re∣turn again to him; but I could not prevail.</P>
<P><HI>Thursday</HI> 23. <HI>Edward Cloutman</HI> and <HI>Robert Dun∣bar,</HI> two Prisoners, broke Prison, and made their Escape; but it was found out the next Morning, and we were upon it threatned to be confined to our Rooms, but this Threatning was never executed, the only Consequent in Respect to us was to have a stricter Guard kept about us; but they sent out a Number of Men in pursuit after them.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> 31. Mr. <HI>Phillips</HI> and Mr. <HI>Pinkham,</HI> with about a Dozen of their Men went out from us in or∣der to return Home; but they went by the Way of the <HI>West-Indies.</HI></P>
<P>Here I shall speak of the Sickness that prevail'd among the Prisoners: It had generally been very healthy in the Prison before this Fall; for tho' there had been some Prisoners there sixteen Months, and about 50, nine Months, yet there had but two died; the first—</P>
<P><HI>Lawrence Platter,</HI> he was taken at <HI>Sarratago, Nov.</HI> 17. 1745, and died the Winter following.</P>
<P>—<HI>Johnes,</HI> taken at <HI>Contoocook</HI> in the Summer 1746, and died in <HI>August</HI> following.</P>
<P>But our People who were taken at Sea by the two French Men of War, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Larora,</HI> &amp; <HI>Le Castore,</HI> found a very mortal epidemical Fever raged among the French on board their Ships, of which many of them died: The Prisoners took the Infection, and the greatest Part of them were sick, while they lay
<PB N="31" REF="006211_0030_10280C0B1AB616C8"/>
in <HI>Jebucta</HI> Harbour; yet but one or two of them died of it; and when they set out from thence for <HI>Menis,</HI> some of them were sick, and some they left sick at <HI>Menis</HI> when they set out for <HI>Canada</HI>; some of them were taken with the Distemper upon their Passage to <HI>Canada,</HI> and so brought the Infection into the Prison; and the Fever being epidemical, soon spread it self in the Prison, to our great Distress: Those who bro't it into the Prison mostly recovered, and so there were many others, that had it &amp; recover∣ed; but the Recovery of some was but for a Time, many of them relapsed, and died: It put me in Mind of that Text, Jude ver. 5. <HI>I will therefore put you in Remembrance, tho' ye once knew this, how that the Lord having saved the People out of the Land of Egypt after∣wards destroyed them that believed not.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that I have any Reason to think ill of those upon whom the Sickness fell, and who died with it: Man of them, I hope, were truly pious and godly Persons.

<P>The sickness increasing and spreading it self so greatly, we sent a very humble Petition to his Lord∣ship the Governor-General, intreating that the Sick might be removed out to the Hospital, least the whole Prison should be infected; but he refused to lead our People to the Hospital, for they told us, that their Hospital was full of their own Sick; yet he did not wholly neglect our Petition, but ordered that one of the most convenient Rooms in the Prison should be assigned for the Sick, where they should be all carried, and have their Attendance, and this was directly done, and the Sick were all brought in.</P>

<P>The 28th of this Instant, when the Prisoners were all confined in their Rooms, but one or two in the lower Room cooking the Pot, the Prison House took Fire; it began on the Ridge; we suppose that it catch'd by Sparks lighting upon it, it being very dry and something windy; it soon spread upon the House, and we could not come at it hav∣ing no Ladder, to quench it. There were no Lives lost, but many lost their Bedding and Cloathing.</P>
<P>We were conducted by a strong Guard to the Governor's Yard, where we were kept 'till near Night, when we were conducted to the Back of the Town to the old Wall in a Bow of which they had set up some Plank Tents something like Sheeps-Pens; we had Boards flung down to lay our Beds up∣on, but the Tents generally leaked so much in wet Weather, that none of us could lie dry; and had much wet Weather this Month.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen of our Room sent in a Petition the Be∣ginning of <HI>May,</HI> that they might be removed to some more convenient Place; upon which we had a House built for us in the Prisoners Yard, about 20 Feet Square, into which we were removed the 23d Instant.
