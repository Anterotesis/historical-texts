<P>AT this important crisis, GEORGE WASHINGTON having declined to serve as President of the United States, after the 4th of March next, and JOHN ADAMS having been held up as a candidate to succeed him in that office, it is conceived a duty to submit to the consideration of the citizens of the United States, sundry political doctrines and opinions on government, written by Mr. ADAMS, whilst Minister at the court of London, in his book, entitled, <HI>"A Defence of the American Constitution."</HI></P>
<P>Let the independent Citizens of America, now determine how far Mr. ADAMS has apostatized from all his former sen∣timents in favor of American liberty and independence, by writing this Eulogium of Monarchy and the British Consti∣tution, and consequently, how far he is to be regarded as a fit person to be elected President of the United States.</P>
