<HEAD>REV. MR. <HI>WEST</HI>'S SERMON, AT HIS INSTALMENT.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">C</SEG>HRISTIANITY is the method devised by infinite wisdom and goodness to effect the salvation and hap∣piness of fallen man. The execution of this gracious plan is committed to JESUS CHRIST the Son of GOD; who, as he fulfilled his Ministry on earth, raised up and commissioned chos∣en men, whom he named Apostles, to com∣plete the establishment of his spiritual kingdom here below, and the sacred vol∣ume agreeable to which it is to be govern∣ed. Which being accomplished, the Min∣isters of CHRIST receive their authority
<PB N="4" REF="022275_0003_0FB7ACC1588A8C08"/>
from him indeed, but in the way of his common providence, and under the gener∣al direction of his SPIRIT. How men are invested with that office—the difficulties which attend it—and the motives which should engage them to diligence and per∣severance in it, will form the subject of the following discourse, founded on those words:
<Q><BIBL>II. CORINTHIANS, iv.1.</BIBL>
<P>THEREFORE, SEEING WE HAVE THIS MINISTRY, AS WE HAVE RECEIVED MERCY, WE FAINT NOT.</P></Q></P>
<P>THE Apostle concludes the preceding chapter with representing the great effect of Christianity, as producing the image of GOD in the hearts of men; from whence he infers the dignity and importance of the Gospel Ministry. <HI>Therefore, seeing we have,</HI> &amp;c. That is, Since the great design and effect of the Gospel is to restore de∣praved human nature to the lost image, forfeited favour and enjoyment of GOD, how interesting and important is the Min∣istry of CHRIST! And as it has pleased him in his distinguishing mercy, to invest us with, and to support us in that office, so, under all the difficulties which we meet with, far from being discouraged, we pur∣sue
<PB N="5" REF="022275_0004_0FB7ACC4019A2BE8"/>
it, with a zeal and resolution propor∣tioned to the greatness of its object, the glory of CHRIST, and the salvation of the souls of men.</P>
<P>IT would be arrogance in the ordinary Ministers of the Gospel to assume the stile of the Apostles, or apply to themselves what was only intended of those primitive and inspired Preachers of Christianity. But, as the Ministers of CHRIST in every age derive their authority from him, as they are engaged in the same cause, serve the same Divine Master, from whose gracious hand they expect their final reward; so the same grateful ardour becomes them, and the same animating motives should excite their zeal and diligence, in pursuing the great ends of their Ministry.</P>
<P>AS GOD originally produced the grand system of nature by an immediate exercise of his almighty power; but, when pro∣duced, governs it in the course of his com∣mon providence, agreeable to certain stated laws: So, when by the miraculous exercise of the same almighty power, he had intro∣duced and established his spiritual kingdom among men, he left it to be governed by the same universal providence, under the direction of his SPIRIT, and agreeable to the dictates of his holy word.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="022275_0005_0FB7ACC6330D84E0"/>JESUS CHRIST administers the govern∣ment of providence. He is in particular that King whom GOD hath anointed upon his holy hill of Sion, and who is therefore head over all things to his Church. JESUS CHRIST raises up and qualifies some for the work of the Ministry, by bestowing upon them those natural and intellectual talents, a competent share of which is evidently necessary to the purpose. For whilst we readily acknowledge on the one hand, that the most shining talents are not essential to the work of the Ministry, it cannot be supposed on the other, agreeable to the mind of CHRIST, that persons should be appointed to that office to whom he has denied the abilities necessary to the proper discharge of the common affairs of life. If shining talents are not indispensable, they are at least ornamental to the Ministry and useful to the Church.</P>
<P>THE same all disposing Providence fa∣vours some with advantages for acquiring such degrees of learning as are, if not es∣sential, greatly conducive to the ends of the Ministry. An acquaintance with sci∣ence has a happy effect on the characters of men: It enlarges the mind, softens the manners, and furnishes with a variety, both of sentiment and language, for the instruc∣tion of others. Learning is not, by any
<PB N="7" REF="022275_0006_0FB7ACCB18CEFB90"/>
means, to be set in competition with an experimental acquaintance with true re∣ligion. Nor do we pretend that it neces∣sarily tends to render men pious or virtu∣ous. Like all other temporal advantages it is very liable to be abused as the occa∣sion of pride and self sufficiency; and is, perhaps, as often perverted in this manner as any distinction which one man possesses above another. But when consecrated by divine grace to the honour and service of CHRIST, it becomes not only an ornament to the office, but tends to the accomplish∣ment of its great design; and is a qualifi∣cation nearly indispensable, in those who are set for the defence of the Gospel.</P>
<P>BUT CHRIST designates or points out some for the work of the Ministry in a more direct way, by the effectual teachings of his HOLY SPIRIT; leading them into an acquaintance with the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven; enabling them to re∣alize the truth of his doctrines, the excel∣lency of his character, the beauties of ho∣liness, and the grandeur of those prospects which are opened, through him, into the eternal world.</P>
<P>WHATEVER natural talents a man may possess—whatever learning he may have acquired, we must insist upon it, that the
<PB N="8" REF="022275_0007_0FB7ACCC95E2FF30"/>
effectual teachings of the blessed SPIRIT of GOD, or that spiritual discernment which distinguishes spiritual things, is necessary to the work of the Ministry; and that it cannot be the mind of the great Head of the Church, that men should be appointed to that office, whose commission has not thus (if you will indulge the expression) been sealed with his own hand; that is, who are not partakers of his spirit and a∣dorned with his image. Is that man prop∣erly qualified to urge others to accept of CHRIST, who has not himself accepted him? Will he be likely to recommend the Gos∣pel to others, who has not embraced it himself?—Will he be a good soldier of JESUS CHRIST, who has never given his al∣legiance to that Divine Master?—Will he pursue his Ministry with proper zeal and perseverance, through all the difficulties with which it is attended, who has no sense of the excellency of the Gospel, or the worth of souls, and is a stranger to those hopes which should warm the heart and animate the services of the Minister of CHRIST?—In a word, is he qualified to take care of and watch for the souls of oth∣ers, who has neglected his own soul?— You will readily acknowledge the absurdi∣ty of the above suppositions, and of conse∣quence, how necessary it is, that the Min∣isters
<PB N="9" REF="022275_0008_0FB7ACCE152B9228"/>
of CHRIST should be partakers of the spirit of CHRIST.</P>
<P>BUT we do not suppose, that a man's pos∣sessing the above qualifications, in the most extensive manner, implies that he is under any obligation to engage in the work of the Ministry. There ought to be a partic∣ular inclination of the heart to it, attended with a persuasion of the mind, that GOD requires it of him, and that, of consequence, it is his duty thus to serve the LORD CHRIST. When the above mentioned particulars meet with the acceptance and approbation of the Church and People of GOD, there is an evident designation to office, and such men are called of GOD, as really, though in a different way, as those primitive preach∣ers, whom he pointed out by the miracu∣lous gifts of his HOLY SPIRIT.</P>
<P>WE do not consider the ministerial office as necessarily assumed for life; many cir∣cumstances may concur to render a contin∣uance in it improper, and even impracti∣cable. The same leading Providence which has pointed out the expediency of taking it up, may, with equal evidence, convince us that it is proper to relinquish it.</P>
<P>AS the work of the Ministry is import∣ant, so, like most other interesting pursuits, it is attended with many difficulties and
<PB N="10" REF="022275_0009_0FB7ACD3D92D5FA0"/>
discouragements. It affords but little pros∣pect of worldly advantage, less than either of the other learned professions, whilst the service which it requires is equal, or, per∣haps, greater. And as for the pleasures and honours of science, the man who faith∣fully attends to his duty, as a Minister of CHRIST, will find but little leisure to in∣dulge in curious learned disquisitions; or, if he does so, there is great reason to fear, it must be at the expense of, what is infi∣nitely more important, a proper attention to the duties of his office and the salvation of souls. That man makes a wretched ex∣change, who forfeits the favour of his Di∣vine Master and endangers the souls of men, for the sake of enjoying the pleasures of learning or obtaining the honours of a literary character.</P>
<P>THE good Minister will find much dis∣couragement from the imperfections of his own heart: His office renders it necessary that he should be much engaged in the ex∣ercises of piety and in religious conversa∣tion; but alas! how difficult does he find it, always to keep alive that spirit of relig∣ion, without which, the exercises of piety and religious conversation, become a pain∣ful, instead of a pleasing service. He wish∣es to exemplify in his own temper and con∣duct, that religion which he preaches to
<PB N="11" REF="022275_0010_0FB7ACD59B643118"/>
others; but upon trial he finds, with pain∣ful regret, that, in many instances, this is impracticable. He is obliged to plead the sincerity of his intentions, to excuse the de∣ficiencies of his conduct with men; whilst, with respect to his Maker, he considers the sacrifice of JESUS as the ground of his own as well as his people's hope of pardon, sal∣vation and happiness.</P>
<P>THERE is much discouragement arising to the faithful Minister of CHRIST, from the froward humours of mankind. He is often censured where he ought to have met with commendation—and discharging the most difficult office of friendship, reprov∣ing the faults of men, though done with exquisite caution, will often forfeit their friendship, and convert it to the cruelest hatred. Those in whose service he has la∣boured with the most painful assiduity, will, when unreasonably offended, reward him with the most bitter reproaches. He frequently finds reason to adopt the com∣plaint of his Divine Master, that he has <HI>laboured in vain, and spent his strength for naught and in vain.</HI> To which we may add the awful apprehension of bringing on himself the blood of souls who may perish through his neglect. These are some of the discouragements which attend the work of the Ministry. They are formidable in∣deed;
<PB N="12" REF="022275_0011_0FB7ACD71487EF88"/>
but the faithful Ministers of CHRIST may notwithstanding adopt the language of the text, <HI>we faint not.</HI> The same mercy of GOD which has honoured us, putting us into that office and has hitherto sup∣ported, will still support us whilst we con∣tinue faithful to him.</P>
<P>THERE are many considerations to en∣courage the heart and animate the labours of the faithful Minister. He is engaged in a service which claims the attention of all holy and good beings, whether on earth or in heaven. He is a worker together with GOD, and so long as he studies to shew himself approved unto GOD, he is sure of his gracious presence. His office, to speak modestly of it, is of great importance to mankind, and has therefore been held in high repute by the wise and the good of every age. It is an office well adapted to gratify the benevolent affections of the hu∣man heart. The very design of it is the happiness of mankind—to second the views of the compassionate SAVIOUR of the world —to save those who are lost—to open the prison doors to those who are bound—to release the captive from his chains—to comfort the mourner and to heal the broken heart—to instruct the ignorant—reclaim the wanderer to the paths of virtue—and encourage the disciples of JESUS in their
<PB N="13" REF="022275_0012_0FB7ACDCC1F1C5B0"/>
fidelity to him and perseverance in his ser∣vice.—Pleasing office! where the heart is engaged in it, and where success attends our labours, and we are instrumental, in the hands of CHRIST, in promoting the salvation and happiness of the souls of men. We serve a gracious Master, who is as willing as he is able to afford us every needed support, and whose address to us is the same which silenced the fears of the Apostle Paul, <HI>My grace is sufficient for you.</HI> We act always under his eye; a pow∣erful motive to exertion, as we are sure no instance of it, however inconsiderable in itself, or unknown to the world, will pass unnoticed or unrewarded by him. We act with a view to eternity, and in pros∣pect of the rewards of our fidelity and zeal at the end of our warfare, when <HI>they who have turned many unto righteousness shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and as the stars forever and ever.</HI> How well adapted are such views as these to lighten every burden, to reconcile us to every trial, and to call forth every exertion? Who would not cheerfully spend and be spent for such a Master and in such a service? Blessed JE∣SUS, our faith looks to thee, through the vale of death, and anticipates the all im∣portant moment when we shall hear from thy gracious lips, <HI>Well done good and faith∣ful servants, enter ye into the joys of your LORD.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="022275_0013_0FB7ACDDD9588680"/>WE infer, from what has been said, that the Ministry of the Gospel is a painful and laborious service; that it is ill suited to the indulgence of sloth and dissipation. <HI>Much study is a weariness to the flesh</HI>: The solicitude which the good Minister feels for the proper discharge of his duty, and the success of his Ministry, is much more painful. His hands and his heart will be constantly employed, and the affectionate manner in which he pursues his Ministry in private, will discover itself in the warmth of his publick addresses; and one spirit of rational, consistent and animated zeal will give life and ornament to every duty.</P>
<P>I ADDRESS myself, with great affection, to the Church and Society who have, with such unanimity, invited me to the pastoral office among them, and to whose service I am this day consecrating myself in a pub∣lick manner.</P>
<P>MEN AND BRETHREN,</P>
<P>THE Minister of CHRIST is the servant of his Church, and his labours, as to time and place, ought to be regulated by the prospect of doing good, or promoting the interests of religion. But when by mutu∣al agreement, a relation is formed between him and a particular people, it becomes exceeding near and interesting; their hap∣piness
<PB N="15" REF="022275_0014_0FB7ACDF8B24EF90"/>
is closely connected. The relation ought never to be dissolved but upon the most urgent necessity—it never can be dis∣solved but with the most painful sensa∣tions. Friendship is balm to a pained heart—The affectionate manner in which you have received me, the kind attention with which you have treated me, are ex∣ceedingly soothing, and afford the most pleasing and flattering prospect. But you will allow me to observe, that it is your conduct towards our Divine Master, for which I ought to be principally concerned. Would you give me the greatest pleasure, it must be by a serious attention to the in∣stitutions of religion, and practice of its duties. I expect, indeed, as I stand in need of your candour towards me, that you will not lightly admit a prejudice against me, and that you will give me the first op∣portunity of explaining for myself, what∣ever may need explanation, either in my preaching or conduct. I was going to ask your prayers—but I am sure you will not cease to pray for the success of my Minis∣try, with which your own and your chil∣dren's happiness is so nearly connected.— This much depends upon the countenance and encouragement which I shall receive from the principal members of the society, who, I am persuaded, will not fail to sec∣ond
<PB N="16" REF="022275_0015_0FB7ACE3AF801478"/>
my endeavours to promote the cause of piety and virtue among us. May the GOD of peace dwell with us—his glory be advanced by us—and his blessing rest up∣on us.</P>
<P>I CANNOT omit this opportunity of paying my grateful acknowledgments to the inhabitants of the town in general, and to my brethren in the Ministry in par∣ticular, for the very obliging manner in which they have received me, and the kind attention which they have paid to me, since I have been among them.—With respect to my brethren in the Ministry, I can with great propriety adopt the words of St. Paul, <HI>These are my fellow workers to the kingdom of GOD, who have been a comfort unto me.</HI> I greatly rejoice in that spirit of candour which at present prevails between Minis∣ters of different denominations: May it more and more prevail, that, united by that <HI>charity which is the bond of perfectness,</HI> in∣stead of dividing upon circumstantials, we may use our joint endeavours for promot∣ing the great essentials of our holy religion.</P>
<P>I PROMISE myself great pleasure and ad∣vantage from my connexion with persons of such amiable characters. May we en∣courage each other in the service of our common Master, and long know <HI>how good
<PB N="17" REF="022275_0016_0FB7ACE556E40410"/>
and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity.</HI></P>
<P>LASTLY,</P>
<P>I ADDRESS myself in a few pathetick words to this great and very respectable assembly.—If an heathen monarch, as an∣cient history informs us, once wept over a numerous concourse of his fellow crea∣tures, on reflecting that they must soon become the prey of death, how much more does this tear of tenderness become the eye of one, who is professedly the Minister of the GOD of mercy and the compassionate SAVIOUR of the world.</P>
<P>IT is to that SAVIOUR I would now direct your views; <HI>Behold the LAMB of GOD, which taketh away the sin of the world.</HI> Are you desirous of obtaining happiness? Yes, for what child of Adam is not? In JESUS CHRIST all fulness dwells: He is that <HI>wisdom, which is a tree of life to them who lay hold upon her; and happy is every one that retaineth her; whose ways are pleasantness and all whose paths are peace.</HI> JESUS CHRIST can and will sup∣ply every real want, and satisfy every rea∣sonable desire. But where shall we find, and how shall we secure an interest in this inestimable friend? Attend to his address; <HI>Behold I stand at the door and knock: If any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will
<PB N="18" REF="022275_0017_0FB7ACE6D46FE348"/>
come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.</HI> You will easily recollect, that from your earliest remembrance, CHRIST has been urging this admission to your hearts; or, which is the same thing, he has by a gentle, but powerful influence, been pointing you to religion as the only means of happiness; saying, <HI>This is the way, walk ye in it.</HI> Admit him then into your hearts, make him the ground of your trust, the object of your affections, and he will be the source of your joys; <HI>the peace of GOD which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through CHRIST JESUS.</HI></P>
<P>THE kingdom of CHRIST <HI>is an everlast∣ing kingdom, and his dominion ruleth over all.</HI> His subjects are partakers with him in the glory and happiness of his reign. <HI>Lift up your heads</HI> therefore <HI>and rejoice,</HI> ye servants of CHRIST, <HI>for your redemption draweth nigh. Sorrow may endure for a night, but joy com∣eth in the morning. You shall return and come, with singing, unto Sion, and ever∣lasting joy shall be upon your heads. You shall obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and mourning shall flee away.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE CHARGE, GIVEN TO THE REV. MR. <HI>WEST,</HI> BY THE REV. MR. <HI>BELKNAP.</HI></HEAD>
<P>TO form the character of a Minis∣ter of JESUS CHRIST, it is necessary that he be first qualified, with gifts and graces, proper for the discharge of his office, and then that he be regularly called to exercise them.</P>
<P>CHURCHES have a right to elect their own Pastors; but before they exercise this right, it becomes them, impartially and devoutly, to look into the word of GOD, to see what qualifications are required in a Gospel Minister; and then charitably to judge, whether the person whom they are desir∣ous of appointing to this office, be possessed of those qualifications; if they find a cor∣respondence between the marks there laid down, and the character which he exhib∣its, they have a sufficient warrant to call him to officiate; because they may on good grounds be satisfied that the HOLY GHOST has fitted him to be an Overseer of the Church of GOD.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="022275_0019_0FB7ACEF0CA5EA40"/>IT does not become <HI>the children of light</HI> to involve in clouds of mystery, that which ought to appear void of all ambiguity. As far as Ordination, in the primitive times, was the conferring a gift or ability to ex∣ercise powers peculiar to the state of the Church in that age, we have nothing to do with it; but as far as it is the designation or appointment of a qualified person to the office of teaching and ruling in the Church of GOD, according to his word, there is nothing mysterious in it. The concurrence of neighbouring Ministers and Churches in the publick investiture is but an act of communion and a testimony of their broth∣erly love.</P>
<P>IF the Apostles were endowed with ex∣traordinary powers, those powers have ceased with their personal Ministry. We know of no successors to them in their a∣postolick character, nor do we conceive that there is the least necessity for such a suc∣cession, while they themselves are present with us for all the purposes of christian edification, in their valuable writings. From them we learn the characters and duties of Gospel Ministers: By them Churches are to govern themselves in their choice, and Ministers in the exercise of their gifts: By an appeal to them we may regulate all our proceedings; and the nearer we conform
<PB N="21" REF="022275_0020_0FB7ACEFD83B0C78"/>
to the simplicity, the better shall we pre∣serve the purity of divine institutions. Let the Apostles then be heard speaking in the name of their Master and of ours; and let no assumption of spiritual power interpose itself, as a medium, between CHRIST and his Church. The sheep will hear the voice of their own shepherd; but <HI>they know not the voice of strangers.</HI></P>
<P>WE claim no sacerdotal rights by virtue of any real or supposed uninterrupted suc∣cession from the Apostles. With equal propriety might we seek for evidence of our descent from Adam, to prove ourselves hu∣man beings, as call over the roll of Bish∣ops from the Apostles to this day, to entitle us to the character of Christian Ministers. As there are indubitable marks by which it is manifest that we are of the human race, without the former; so we conceive there are equally distinguishing and satisfactory marks of the Ministers of CHRIST, without the latter. The children of GOD are made such, by the efficacious influence of his word and SPIRIT; from the same source are derived the qualifica∣tions for the Gospel Ministry; and the Churches of CHRIST have a right to call to the exercise of this office him whom they charitably judge the SPIRIT of GOD has qualified for it.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="022275_0021_0FB7ACF15443C650"/>ON such an occasion, it is the duty and pleasure of his brethren, while they bid him welcome as a labourer in the vineyard of their common LORD, to put him in mind of that solemn CHARGE which the HOLY GHOST, in the writings of the Apostles, has given to him and to themselves.</P>
<P>YOU will therefore, my dear Brother, permit me (though your inferiour in age, as well as in other respects) to call your attention, at this time, to those sacred in∣junctions which are given by the HOLY GHOST to you and to us.—They are these:</P>
<P>"PREACH the word. Be instant, in sea∣son, out of season. Reprove, rebuke, ex∣hort, with all long suffering and doctrine.</P>
<P>"HOLD fast the faithful word, as thou hast been taught; and the form of sound words which thou hast heard, in faith and love which is in CHRIST JESUS.</P>
<P>"WATCH thou in all things, endure af∣flictions, make full proof of thy Ministry.</P>
<P>"STUDY to shew thyself approved unto GOD, a workman that needeth not to be a∣shamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.</P>
<P>"BE gentle to all men, apt to teach, pa∣tient, in meekness instructing those who oppose themselves.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="022275_0022_0FB7ACF7134F9E68"/>"FOLLOW after righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them who call on the LORD out of a pure heart.</P>
<P>"BE not ashamed of the testimony of the LORD; but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the Gospel according to the power of GOD.</P>
<P>"BE strong in the grace which is in CHRIST JESUS, and endure hardness as a good soldier of JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>"LET no man despise thee, but be thou an example to the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.</P>
<P>"GIVE attention to reading, to exhorta∣tion, to doctrine. Neglect not the gift that is in thee, but meditate on these things, give thyself wholly to them, that thy prof∣iting may appear unto all.</P>
<P>"TAKE heed to thyself and to thy doc∣trine, continue in them; for in so doing thou shalt both save thyself and them who hear thee.</P>
<P>"THOSE who sin, rebuke before all, that others also may fear. Do nothing by par∣tiality. Lay hands suddenly on no man. Be not partaker of other men's sins. Keep thyself pure.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="022275_0023_0FB7ACF8ED0E1E60"/>"FEED the flock of GOD, taking the o∣versight of it, not by constraint, but will∣ingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; neither as being lord over GOD'S heritage, but as an example to the flock.</P>
<P>"TAKE heed therefore to thyself and to all the flock over which the HOLY GHOST hath made thee an overseer, to feed the Church of GOD which he hath purchased with his own blood.</P>
<P>FINALLY—Remember that the HOLY GHOST, by the pen of the inspired Apostle Paul, "giveth thee in charge in the sight of GOD, who quickeneth all things, and be∣fore JESUS CHRIST, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession; that thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukeable, until the appearing of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the KING of Kings, and LORD of Lords, who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach, whom no man hath seen nor can see; to whom be honour and power everlasting."</P>

<HEAD>THE RIGHT HAND OF FELLOWSHIP,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY THE REV. MR. <HI>ECKLEY.</HI></BYLINE>
<P>THE grand design of the Gospel is to give us information respecting another world, and teach us to find our way to heaven; where, as the friends and disciples of the Son of GOD, we may hold commu∣nion with him in glory;—where, fed forev∣er upon truth, and transported with the displays of the divine majesty and beauty, we may spend our time with holy angels; with prophets and apostles; with martyrs and all our fellow saints, in wonder, love and praise.</P>
<P>THE hopes of Christians in relation to these their future enjoyments, rest not how∣ever on the writings of the Gospel, exclu∣sive of other aid. It pleases their indul∣gent Parent, when they sincerely apply their hearts and minds to the study or his religion, to annex such delight to their meditations, that their present joy serves to
<PB N="26" REF="022275_0025_0FB7ACFC07C10028"/>
corroborate their faith, and is an internal and most convincing evidence of the reali∣ty of things which are unseen, and ever∣lasting in the heavens.</P>
<P>TO promote the study of divine truth;— to improve the Christian's graces and in∣crease his joys, it has seemed good to the great Head over all things, to organize the members of his Church by certain estab∣lished laws;—<HI>giving some, Apostles; and some, Prophets; and some, Evangelists; and some, Pastors and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the Ministry, for the edifying of the body of CHRIST.</HI></P>
<P>CONSIDERING that we are all seeking the same heavenly home;—that we all ac∣knowledge the same Master, and profess our hopes and joys to be of the same kind— how much does it become the members of CHRIST'S Church, who are now necessarily divided into many distinct societies, to ven∣erate and esteem each other!—Yet not more than it becomes the Ministers of our common LORD, who are alike engaged in one honourable employment, and when faithful, are alike depending on one re∣ward.</P>
<P>IN order to encourage this affection be∣tween the Churches and their Pastors, it has been a custom in our Ecclesiastical
<PB N="27" REF="022275_0026_0FB7AD031CCF80E8"/>
Councils at the Ordination or Instalment of a Minister, that one of the members should publickly declare their communion and friendship with him. This agreeable part of the solemnity of the day, by choice of the venerable Council, is devolved on me.</P>
<P>WITH pleasure therefore, <HI>Reverend and dear Sir,</HI> I perform the service, by which the Churches and their Pastors here con∣vened, openly acknowledge your relation to them as a Christian;—receive you as the regularly initiated Pastor of this Church, and bid you welcome as their esteemed brother and respected friend.—Accept my right hand as the token of our affection.— GOD almighty vouchsafe to bless and smile upon you.—With the work of the Gos∣pel Ministry you are already acquainted, having served with reputation and honour in another part of the Christian Church. As by divine Providence you are now call∣ed to officiate to this people, we implore the sovereign Ruler of the universe, to sanctify your labours to them, for their spiritual and eternal good.—May <HI>you,</HI> my dear Sir, and the <HI>rest of us</HI> in the Gos∣pel Ministry, be instrumental in turning many sinners unto righteousness;—and af∣ter having lived together as Christians, as Brethren, and as good Ministers in the
<PB N="28" REF="022275_0027_0FB7AD0417D011C0"/>
present world, may we be so happy as to meet in a better, and hear our SAVIOUR pronounce unto us, <HI>Well done good and faith∣ful servants; enter ye into the joy of your LORD.</HI></P>
<P>WILL you permit me now, <HI>my Brethren of this Christian Society,</HI> to address myself to you also on this agreeable occasion.</P>
<P>THE connexion which existed between us some time ago, as it will not be forgot∣ten on my part, neither will it, I trust, on yours also.—Often have we mingled our souls together at the same Church, in hum∣ble adoration of the GOD of heaven;—oft∣en have we sat as brethren around the same table of our SAVIOUR, when in his course of duty, your late worthy and pious Pas∣tor, has carried our spirits to the Almigh∣ty's throne, and in able, solemn and pa∣thetick prayer, presented us before the LORD.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">AFTER the Church in Hollis Street was destroyed by the fire in 1787, the greater part of the society assembled at the Old South Church, where the two congregations unit∣ed in the worship, and the Rev. Mr. Wight, who is the gentleman here referred to, assisted at times, in performing the publick service.</NOTE></P>
<P>YOU will allow me thus to pay my tribute of respect to a much esteemed brother, and beloved friend. Since in the providence of GOD, he is deprived of
<PB N="29" REF="022275_0028_0FB7AD05D62B8D68"/>
his health, and on this account, in conse∣quence of his desire and your consent, his connexion with you is closed, we rejoice and congratulate you this day, my Christ∣ian friends, that you have found another Pastor in whom you so well unite; who is able to serve you in the duties of his pro∣fession, and whose praise is in the Churches.</P>
<P>WE shall not forget the time when the edifice wherein you formerly worshipped on this spot, was wrapt in flames;—when the houses in which you dwelled, were laid in ashes by the fire, and many a heart was swelled with terrour at the sight, and many an eye was bathed with tears.—We behold already a great reverse of scenes;—and whilst the elegant and goodly fabrick in which we are now assembled, affords a very pleasing specimen of the taste and genius of the gentleman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MR. Charles Bulfinch.</NOTE> who gave the plan, it is a monument to you, my friends, of the great goodness of almighty GOD, who in his providence has assisted you to repair the waste places, and after your dispersion, enabled you to worship him in the spot where his name was known before.</P>
<P>NOR will it be amiss, if, when sitting in this building, and happening at some min∣ute or other to be reflecting on its superi∣ority
<PB N="30" REF="022275_0029_0FB7AD0AE0EB4EA0"/>
in comparison with the one which was lost by fire, you allow the circumstance to remind you of that vastly more agreea∣ble and beneficial exchange to be made on the august and important day, when all the faithful friends of the REDEEMER shall be admitted into the temple of GOD above, not made with hands, which, for external beauty and advantage, inconceivably sur∣passes any thing that is known on earth, but much more excels in glory, by reason of the perfect spirituality of its worship, the unmingled zeal and affection of the inhab∣itants, and that exalted holiness which ever gives rise to the most enraptured Alleluias, and the profoundest praise.—For this celestial employment, may you here acquire a preparation.—To these blessed mansions, may you be received in the proper time, and so be ever with the LORD.</P>
<P>FINALLY—LET all of us who are pres∣ent on this occasion, reflect seriously on the mutablity of all earthly things; the design of our existence here below, and the necessity of living in a constant state of readiness for our own great change.—It is to be remembered that the period of probation will speedily have a close, and the day of the LORD is fast approaching, when our hopes and expectations of happiness will be put to a trial, conformably to the laws of
<PB N="31" REF="022275_0030_0FB7AD0E382980A0"/>
divine writ, by which we must infallibly abide.</P>
<P>THROUGH sincere repentance for our sins, and faith in JESUS CHRIST, may we be prepared for his coming. <HI>Then</HI>—when as we once saw the former Church upon this ground encircled with the flames, we shall behold a general conflagration all a∣round us;—when the whole world shall be on fire, and the elements melting with fervent heat, may we shout aloud, for our redemption draweth nigh.—Secured by our station near the Son of GOD, may we stand unmoved amidst the wreck of time; and with the ransomed of the LORD—with songs, and everlasting joy upon our heads, be received into the new heavens and the new earth which are prepared for the saints; where righteousness, peace and love shall be the ingredients of our felicity, and we shall sing the new anthem, <HI>To him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, and hath made us kings and priests unto GOD and his Father; to him be glory and dominion, forever and ever.</HI></P>
