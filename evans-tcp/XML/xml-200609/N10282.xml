<P>NOTHING gives more convincing proof of deficiency in judgment or malevo∣lence of heart in an Author, than general, undistinguishing satire, levelled at an order of men, at a sex, or at human nature. Most writers, who have taken the Fair Sex as their subject, have treated them without proper dis∣tinction, and either deified them without ex∣ceptions, or condemned them without mercy; and scarcely have the Ladies been more ex∣posed by ridiculous flattery, than injured by undeserved censure. The Roman Poet, <HI>Ju∣venal,</HI> who gave the lead to these Lampooners, hath railed at the Sex in a very long satire, the most witty and injudicious of all his pro∣ductions. The Essay on the Characters of Women by <HI>Pope,</HI> notwithstanding the capri∣cious praises of his whimsical Editor, is one of his least meritorious performances, and was justly received with coldness by the public. <HI>Swift,</HI> tho' he hath shown far greater know∣lege of human nature, hath debased all his
<PB N="vi" REF="013052_0004_0F8FF5F9D5ED3090"/>
satires on the Ladies, by the most general as∣persions and dirty raillery. <HI>Young,</HI> inferior perhaps to the two last in genius, hath display∣ed much more judgment and true wit on these subjects. His satires I would recommend to the perusal of my fair readers, as the reproofs and corrections of a friend. The man, who only insults over vice and folly, without shew∣ing their causes, or pointing out the remedy, employs his pen to very little purpose: like a physician, who should prove you had a mor∣tal disease, and yet through malice or igno∣rance should refuse a prescription.</P>
<P>My design in this Poem is to shew, that all the foibles we discover in the Fair Sex arise principally from the neglect of their educati∣on, and the mistaken notions they imbibe in their early youth. This naturally introduced a description of these foibles, which I have endeavoured to laugh at with good humour, and to expose without malevolence. Had I only consulted my own taste, I would have preferred sense and spirit with a style more e∣levated and poetical, to a perpetual drollery, and the affectation of wit: but I have found by experience in the second part of this work, that it is not so agreeable to the bulk of my readers; and I wished in the last production I shall probably offer the public to have the good fortune of general approbation. I have endeavoured to avoid unseasonable seve∣rity, and hope, in that point, I am pretty clear of censure; especially as some of my good friends in these parts have lately made
<PB N="vii" REF="013052_0005_0F8FF5FA9C2B8470"/>
a discovery that severity is not my talent, and there is nothing to be feared from the strokes of my satire; a discovery, that on this head hath given me no small consolation. In the following poem, my design is so apparent, that I am not much afraid of general misre∣presentation; and I hope there are no grave folks, who will think it trifling or unimpor∣tant. I expect however, from the treatment I have already received in regard to the for∣mer parts of this work, as well as some later and more fugitive productions, that my de∣signs will by many be ignorantly or wilfully misunderstood. I shall rest satisfied with the consciousness that a desire to promote the in∣terests of learning and morality was the prin∣cipal motive, that influenced me in these writ∣ings; judging as I did, that unless I attempt∣ed something in this way, that might conduce to the service of mankind, I had spent much time in the studies of the Muses in vain.</P>
<P>Polite literature hath within a few years made very considerable advances in <HI>America.</HI> Mankind in general seem sensible of the im∣portance and advantages of learning. Female Education hath been most neglected; and I wish this small performance may have some tendency to encourage and promote it. The sprightliness of Female genius, and the excel∣lence of that Sex in their proper walks of sci∣ence are by no means inferior to the accom∣plishments of Men. And although the course of their education ought to be different, and writing is not so peculiarly the business of the
<PB N="viii" REF="013052_0006_0F8FF5FB51729D20"/>
sex, yet I cannot but hope hereafter to see the accomplishment of my prediction in their favor.</P>
<L>Her Daughters too this happy land shall grace</L>
<L>With pow'rs of genius, as with charms of face:</L>
<L>Blest with the softness of the female mind,</L>
<L>With fancy blooming, and with taste refin'd,</L>
<L>Some <HI>Rowe</HI> shall rise and wrest with daring pen,</L>
<L>The pride of genius from assuming men;</L>
<L>While each bright line a polish'd beauty wears;</L>
<L>For ev'ry Muse and ev'ry Grace are theirs.</L>

<HEAD>The Progress of Coquetry.</HEAD>
<L>"COME hither, <HI>Harriet,</HI> pretty Miss,</L>
<L>Come hither; give your aunt a kiss.</L>
<L>What, blushing? fye, hold up your head.</L>
<L>Full six years old, and yet afraid!</L>
<L>With such a form, an air, a grace,</L>
<L>You're not asham'd to shew your face!</L>
<L>Look like a Lady—bold—my Child—</L>
<L>Why, Ma'am, your <HI>Harriet</HI> will be spoil'd.</L>
<L>What pity 'tis, a girl so sprightly</L>
<L>Should hang her head so unpolitely?</L>
<L>And sure there's nothing worth a rush in</L>
<L>That odd, unnatural trick of blushing;</L>
<L>It marks one ungenteelly bred,</L>
<L>And shows she's mischief in her head.</L>
<L>I've heard <HI>Dick Hairbrain</HI> prove from <HI>Paul,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Eve</HI> never blush'd before the fall.</L>
<L>'Tis said indeed, in later days,</L>
<L>It gain'd our grandmothers some praise;</L>
<L>Perhaps it suited well enough</L>
<L>With hoop and fardingale and ruff;</L>
<L>But this politer generation</L>
<L>Hold ruffs and blushes out of fashion.</L>
<L>And what can mean that gown so odd?</L>
<L>You ought to dress her in the mode,</L>
<L>To teach her how to make a figure;</L>
<L>Or she'll be awkward when she's bigger,</L>
<L>And look as queer as <HI>Joan of Nokes,</HI></L>
<L>And never rig like other folks;</L>
<L>Her cloaths will trail all fashion lost,</L>
<L>As if she hung them on a post,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="013052_0008_0F8FF5FEA04A0D60"/>And sit as awkwardly as <HI>Eve</HI>'s</L>
<L>First peagreen petticoat of leaves.</L>
<L>And what can mean your simple whim here</L>
<L>To keep her poring on her primmer?</L>
<L>'Tis quite enough for girls to know,</L>
<L>If she can read a billet-doux,</L>
<L>Or write a line you'd understand</L>
<L>Without an alphabet o'th' hand.</L>
<L>Why needs she learn to write, or spell?</L>
<L>A pothook-scrawl is just as well;</L>
<L>It ranks her with the better sort,</L>
<L>For 'tis the reigning mode at court.</L>
<L>And why should girls be learn'd or wise?</L>
<L>Books only serve to spoil their eyes.</L>
<L>The studious eye but faintly twinkles,</L>
<L>And reading paves the way to wrinkles.</L>
<L>In vain may learning fill the head full:</L>
<L>'Tis Beauty that's the one thing needful;</L>
<L>Beauty, our sex's sole pretence,</L>
<L>The best receipt for female sense,</L>
<L>The charm, that turns all words to witty,</L>
<L>And makes the silliest speeches pretty.</L>
<L>Ev'n folly borrows killing graces</L>
<L>From ruby lips and roseate faces.</L>
<L>Give airs and beauty to your daughter,</L>
<L>And sense and wit will follow after."</L>
<L>Thus round the infant Miss in state</L>
<L>The council of the Ladies meet,</L>
<L>And gay in modern style and fashion</L>
<L>Prescribe their rules of education.</L>
<L>The Mother, once herself a toast,</L>
<L>Prays for her child the self-same post;</L>
<L>The Father hates the toil and pother,</L>
<L>And leaves his daughters to their mother;</L>
<L>A proper hand their youth to guide,</L>
<L>And o'er their studies to preside;</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="013052_0009_0F8FF5FFCB01E2E8"/>From whom her faults, that never vary,</L>
<L>May come by right hereditary,</L>
<L>Follies be multiplied with quickness,</L>
<L>And whims keep up the family likeness.</L>
<L>Ye Parents, shall those forms so fair,</L>
<L>The Graces might be proud to wear,</L>
<L>The charms those speaking eyes display,</L>
<L>Where passion sits in ev'ry ray,</L>
<L>Th' expressive glance, the air refin'd,</L>
<L>That sweet vivacity of mind,</L>
<L>Be doom'd for life to folly's sway,</L>
<L>By trifles lur'd, to fops a prey,</L>
<L>Blank all the pow'rs that nature gave,</L>
<L>To dress and tinsel-show the slave!</L>
<L>Say, can ye think that charms so bright,</L>
<L>Were giv'n alone to please the sight,</L>
<L>Or like the moon, that forms so fine</L>
<L>Were made for nothing but to shine?</L>
<L>With lips of rose and cheeks of cherry,</L>
<L>Out go the works of statuary?</L>
<L>And gain the prize of show, as victors</L>
<L>O'er busts and effigies and pictures?</L>
<L>Can female Sense no trophies raise?</L>
<L>Are dress and beauty all their praise?</L>
<L>And does no lover hope to find</L>
<L>An angel in his charmer's mind?</L>
<L>First from the dust our sex began.</L>
<L>But woman was refin'd from man;</L>
<L>Receiv'd again, with softer air,</L>
<L>The great Creator's forming care.</L>
<L>And shall it no attention claim</L>
<L>Their beauteous infant souls to frame▪</L>
<L>Shall half your precepts tend the while</L>
<L>Fair nature's lovely work to spoil,</L>
<L>The native innocence deface,</L>
<L>The glowing blush, the modest grace,</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="013052_0010_0F8FF5FFD9909DE0"/>On follies fix their young desire,</L>
<L>To trifles bid their souls aspire,</L>
<L>Fill their gay heads with whims of fashion,</L>
<L>And slight all other cultivation,</L>
<L>Let ev'ry useless barren weed</L>
<L>Of foolish fancy run to seed,</L>
<L>And make their minds the receptacle</L>
<L>Of ev'ry thing that's false and fickle,</L>
<L>Where gay Caprice with wanton air,</L>
<L>And Vanity keep constant fair,</L>
<L>Where ribbands, laces, patches, puffs,</L>
<L>Caps, jewels, ruffles, tippets, muffs,</L>
<L>With gaudy whims of vain parade,</L>
<L>Croud each apartment of the head,</L>
<L>Where stands display'd with costly pains</L>
<L>The toyshop of Coquettish brains,</L>
<L>And high-crown'd caps hang out the sign,</L>
<L>And beaus, as customers throng in;</L>
<L>Whence Sense is banish'd in disgrace,</L>
<L>Where Wisdom dares not shew her face,</L>
<L>Where calm Reflection cannot live,</L>
<L>Nor thought sublime an hour survive;</L>
<L>Where the light head and vacant brain</L>
<L>Spoil all ideas they contain,</L>
<L>As th' airpump kills in half a minute</L>
<L>Each living thing you put within it.</L>
<L>It must be so; by antient rule</L>
<L>The Fair are nurst in Folly's school,</L>
<L>And all their education done</L>
<L>Is none at all, or worse than none;</L>
<L>Whence still proceed in maid or wife,</L>
<L>The follies and the ills of life.</L>
<L>Learning is call'd our mental diet,</L>
<L>That serves the hungry mind to quiet,</L>
<L>That gives the genius fresh supplies,</L>
<L>Till souls grow up to common size:</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="013052_0011_0F8FF600F40250D8"/>But here, despising sense refin'd,</L>
<L>Gay trifles feed the youthful mind.</L>
<L>Chamaeleons thus, whose colours airy</L>
<L>As often as Coquettes can vary,</L>
<L>Despise all dishes rich and rare,</L>
<L>And diet wholly on the air;</L>
<L>Think fogs blest eating, nothing finer,</L>
<L>And can on whirlwinds make a dinner▪</L>
<L>And thronging all to feast together,</L>
<L>Fare daintily in blustring weather.</L>
<L>Here to the Fair alone remain</L>
<L>Long years of action spent in vain;</L>
<L>In numbers little skill it shows</L>
<L>To cast the sum of all she knows.</L>
<L>Perhaps she learns (what can she less?)</L>
<L>The arts of dancing and of dress.</L>
<L>But dress and dancing are to women,</L>
<L>Their education mint and cummin;</L>
<L>These lighter graces should be taught,</L>
<L>And weightier matters not forgot.</L>
<L>For there, where only these are shown,</L>
<L>The soul will fix on these alone.</L>
<L>Then most the fineries of dress</L>
<L>Her thoughts, her wish and time possess;</L>
<L>She values only to be gay,</L>
<L>And works to rig herself for play;</L>
<L>Weaves scores of caps with diff'rent spires,</L>
<L>And all varieties of wires;</L>
<L>Gay ruffles varying just as flow'd</L>
<L>The tides and ebbings of the mode;</L>
<L>Bright flow'rs, and topknots waving high,</L>
<L>That float, like streamers in the sky;</L>
<L>Work'd catgut handkerchiefs, whose flaws</L>
<L>Display the neck, as well as gauze;</L>
<L>Or network aprons somewhat thinnish,</L>
<L>That cost but six weeks time to finish,</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="013052_0012_0F8FF60154DA16C8"/>And yet so neat, as you must own</L>
<L>You could not buy for half a crown—</L>
<L>Perhaps in youth (for country-fashions</L>
<L>Prescrib'd that mode of educations)</L>
<L>She wastes long months in still more tawdry,</L>
<L>And useless labours of embroid'ry;</L>
<L>With toil weaves up for chairs together,</L>
<L>Six bottoms quite as good as leather;</L>
<L>A set of curtains tap'stry work,</L>
<L>The figures frowning like the Turk;</L>
<L>A tentstitch picture, work of folly,</L>
<L>With portraits wrought of <HI>Dick</HI> and <HI>Polly</HI>;</L>
<L>A coat of arms, that mark'd her house,</L>
<L>Three owls rampant, the crest a goose:</L>
<L>Or shews in waxwork Goodman <HI>Adam,</HI></L>
<L>And Serpent gay, gallanting Madam,</L>
<L>A woeful mimickry of <HI>Eden,</HI></L>
<L>With fruit, that needs not be forbidden:</L>
<L>All useless works, that fill for Beauties</L>
<L>Of time and sense their vast vacuities;</L>
<L>Of sense, which reading might bestow,</L>
<L>And time, whose worth they never know.</L>
<L>Now to some pop'lous city sent,</L>
<L>She comes back prouder than she went;</L>
<L>Few months in vain parade she spares,</L>
<L>Nor learns, but apes, politer airs;</L>
<L>So formal acts, with such a set air,</L>
<L>That country-manners far were better.</L>
<L>This springs from want of just discerning,</L>
<L>As pedantry from want of learning;</L>
<L>And proves this maxim true to sight,</L>
<L>The half-genteel are least polite.</L>
<L>Yet still that active spark, the mind</L>
<L>Employment constantly will find,</L>
<L>And when on trifles most 'tis bent,</L>
<L>Is always found most diligent;</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="013052_0013_0F8FF60211A68630"/>For, weighty works men shew most sloth in,</L>
<L>But labour hard at <HI>Doing Nothing,</HI></L>
<L>A trade, that needs no deep concern,</L>
<L>Or long apprenticeship to learn,</L>
<L>To which mankind at first apply</L>
<L>As naturally as to cry,</L>
<L>Till at the last their latest groan</L>
<L>Proclaims their idleness is done.</L>
<L>Good sense, like fruits, is rais'd by toil;</L>
<L>But follies sprout in ev'ry soil,</L>
<L>And where no tillage finds a place,</L>
<L>They grow, like tares, the more apace,</L>
<L>Nor culture, pains, nor planting need,</L>
<L>As moss and mushrooms have no seed.</L>
<L>Thus <HI>Harriet,</HI> rising on the stage,</L>

<L>The trade and politics of fashion:</L>
