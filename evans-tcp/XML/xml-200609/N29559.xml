<P>WHEREAS the Holy and Righteous GOD, is awfully threatning to interrupt and take away the present Peace, and Tranquillity of this Province, by fresh Molesta∣tions, and troubles feared to arise from the Heathen; which with divers other Solemn Considerations, of the apparent just Provocations found in the midst thereof: And the sore and bitter persecutions wherewith the People of God in <HI>France,</HI> and in some other parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> are grievously harrassed and oppressed, for the profession of Christ, and His Truth, do call upon us to deep Humiliation, with Humble Confessions, and Supplications unto God.</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> Do therefore by and with the Advice and Consent of His Majesties Council, and at the desire of the Assembly now Sitting, Order and Appoint, That a General <HI>FAST</HI> be kept throughout this Province, upon <HI>Thursday</HI> the Twenty-Fifth of <HI>April</HI> next. And that therein Humble Confessions, with Earnest and Fervent Supplications be Offered up unto Almighty GOD, by all Ministers and People within the same, in their Respective Congregations, and Assemblies: That God would be graciously pleased to blast and defeat the Evil designs, and purposes of all that hate <HI>Zion</HI>; Bless all Counsels and Means that have been or shall be taken and used, for averting and preventing of the present threatned Danger: That Peace may be continued and Confirmed: That the Gospel may obtain great Success: That the Husbandry, and other Affayrs of this Province may be Smiled upon in the Ensuing year: That our Gracious Lord the <HI>KING</HI> may be Preserved, and Blessed with long Life, to be a Glorious Instrument of further Advancing the Prosperity, and Reformation of the Kingdoms, and Dominions under His Rule and Government: That the Kingdom of our Blessed Lord and Saviour <HI>JESUS CHRIST,</HI> may be Enlarged throughout the Earth; and a Glorious Salvation and Deliverance, Speedily arise to His poor Distressed and Persecuted Church. And all Servile Labour on said Day is hereby forbidden.</P>
