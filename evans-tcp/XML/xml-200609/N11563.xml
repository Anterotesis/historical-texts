<SPEAKER>SIMPLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>I KNOW not what to think of these sad times,</L>

Push'd into place,—a place I ne'er expected,</L>
<L>My bounding heart leapt in my feeble breast.</L>
<L>And extasies entranc'd my slender brain.—</L>
<L>But yet, e're this I hop'd more solid gains,</L>
<L>As my low purse demands a quick supply.—</L>
<L>Poor Sylvia weeps,—and urges my return</L>
<L>To rural peace and humble happiness,</L>
<L>As my ambition beggars all her babes.</L>

<SPEAKER>CRUSTY.</SPEAKER>
<L>When first I listed in the desp'rate cause,</L>
<L>And blindly swore obedience to his will,</L>
<L>So wise, so just, so good I thought RAPATIO,</L>
<L>That if salvation rested on his word</L>
<L>I'd pin my faith, and risk my hopes thereon.</L>

<SPEAKER>CRUSTY.</SPEAKER>
<L>Himself—his perfidy appears—</L>
<L>It is too plain he has betray'd his country;</L>
<L>And we're the wretched tools by him mark'd out</L>
<L>To seal its ruins—tear up the ancient forms,</L>
<L>And every vestige treacherously destroy,</L>
<L>Nor leave a trait of freedom in the land.</L>
<L>Nor did I think hard fate wou'd call me up</L>
<L>From drudging o'er my acres,</L>
<L>Treading the glade, and sweating at the plough,</L>
<L>To dangle at the tables of the great;</L>
<L>At bowls and cards to spend my frozen years;</L>
<L>To sell my friends, my country, and my conscience;</L>
<L>Prophane the sacred sabbaths of my God;</L>

<SPEAKER>HAZLEROD.</SPEAKER>
<L>Pho—what misgivings—why these idle qualms,</L>
<L>This skrinking backwards at the bugbear conscience;</L>
<L>In early life I heard the phantom nam'd,</L>
<L>And the grave sages prate of moral sense</L>
<L>Presiding in the bosom of the just;</L>
<L>Or planting thongs about the guilty heart.</L>
<L>Bound by these shackles, long my lab'ring mind,</L>
<L>Obscurely trod the lower walks of life,</L>
<L>In hopes by honesty my bread to gain;</L>
<L>But neither commerce, or my conjuring rods,</L>
<L>Nor yet mechanics, or new fangled drills,</L>
<L>Or all the iron-monger's curious arts,</L>
<L>Gave me a competence of shining ore,</L>
<L>Or gratify'd my itching palm for more;</L>
<L>Till I dismiss'd the bold intruding guest,</L>
<L>And banish'd conscience from my wounded breast.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CRUSTY.</SPEAKER>
<L>Happy expedient!—Could I gain the art,</L>
<L>Then balmy sleep might sooth my waking lids,</L>
<L>And rest once more refresh my weary soul.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HAZLEROD.</SPEAKER>
<L>Resolv'd more rapidly to gain my point,</L>
<L>I mounted high in justice's sacred seat,</L>
<L>With flowing robes, and head equip'd without,</L>
<L>A heart unfeeling and a stubborn soul,</L>
<L>As qualify'd as e'er a JEFFERIES was;</L>
<L>Save in the knotty rudiments of law,</L>
<L>The smallest requisite for modern times,</L>
<L>When wisdom, law and justice, are supply'd</L>
<L>By swords, dragoons, and ministerial nods,</L>
<L>Sanctions most sacred in the Pander's creed,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="014613_0007_0F943418506BBC40"/>
I sold my country for a splended bribe.</L>
<L>Now let her sink—and all the dire alarms</L>
<L>Of war, confusion, pestilence and blood,</L>
<L>And tenfold mis'ry be her future doom—</L>
<L>Let civil discord lift her sword on high,</L>
<L>Nay sheath its hilt e'en in my brother's blood;</L>
<L>It ne'er shall move the purpose of my soul;</L>
<L>Tho' once I trembled at a thought so bold;</L>

<L>We may live Demons, as we die like brutes,</L>

<L>Curse on their coward fears, and daftard souls,</L>

<L>Though blood and carnage spread thro' all the land;</L>
<L>Till streaming purple tinge the verdant turf,</L>
<L>Till ev'ry street shall float with human gore,</L>

<SPEAKER>SIMPLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>I fear the brave, the injur'd multitude,</L>
<L>Repeated wrongs, arouse them to resent,</L>
<L>And every patriot like old Brutus stands,</L>
<L>The shining steel half drawn—its glitt'ring point</L>
<L>Scarce hid beneath the scabbard's friendly cell,</L>

<L>On quick destruction, misery and death;</L>

<L>Estates confiscate, slav'ry and despair,</L>
<L>Wrecks, halters, axes, gibbeting and chains,</L>

<L>The weeping maid thrown helpless on the world,</L>
<L>Her sire cut off.—Her orphan brothers stand,</L>
<L>While the big tear roll's down the manly cheek.</L>
<L>Robb'd of maternal care by grief's keen shaft,</L>
<L>The sorrowing mother mourns her starving babes,</L>
<L>Her murder'd lord torn guiltless from her side,</L>
<L>And flees for shelter to the pitying grave</L>
<L>To skreen at once from slavery and pain.</L>

<STAGE>The scene changes to a large dining room. The table furnished with bowles, bottles, glasses and cards — The Group appear sitting round in a restless attitude. In one corner of the room is discovered a small cabinet of books, for the use of the studious and contemplative: containing, Hobbs's Leviathan, Sipthorp's Sermons, Hutchinson's History, Fable of the Bees, Philalethes on Philanthropy, with an appendix by Massachusettentis, Hoyl on Whist, Lives of the Stuarts, Statutes of Henry the eighth, and William the Conqueror, Wedderburne's speeches, and acts of Parliament, for 1774.</STAGE>

<SPEAKER>SCRIBLERIUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>—THY toast Monsieur,</L>
<L>Pray, why that solemn phiz:—</L>
<L>Art thou, too, balancing 'twixt right and wrong?</L>
<L>Hast thou a thought so mean as to give up</L>
<L>Thy present good, for promise in reversion?</L>
<L>'Tis true hereafter has some feeble terrors,</L>
<L>But 'ere our grizley heads are wrapt in clay</L>
<L>We may compound, and make our peace with Heav'n.</L>

<SPEAKER>MONSIEUR.</SPEAKER>
<L>Could I give up the dread of retribution,</L>
<L>The awful reck'ning of some future day,</L>
<L>Like surly Hateall I might curse mankind,</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="014613_0011_0F94341B3484C748"/>
And dare the threat'ned vengeance of the skies.</L>
<L>Or like yon apostate—[<HI>Pointing to Hazlerod, retir'd to a corner to read Massachusettensis.</HI>]</L>
<L>Feel but slight remorse</L>
<L>To sell my country for a grasp of gold.</L>
<L>But the impressions of my early youth,</L>
<L>Infix'd by precepts of my pious sire,</L>
<L>Are stings and scorpions in my goaded breast;</L>
<L>Oft have I hung upon my parent's knee</L>
<L>And heard him tell of his escape from France;</L>
<L>He left the land of slaves, and wooden shoes;</L>
<L>From place to place he sought a safe retroat,</L>
<L>Till fair Bostonia stretch'd her friendly arm</L>
<L>And gave the refugee both bread and peace;</L>
<L>(Shall I ungrateful 'rase the sacred bonds,</L>
<L>And help to clank the tyrant's iron chains</L>
<L>O'er these bleft shores—once the sure affylum</L>
<L>From all the ills of arbitrary sway)</L>
<L>With his expiring breath he bade his sons,</L>
<L>If e'er oppression reach'd the western world,</L>
<L>Resist its force, and break the servile yoke.</L>

<SPEAKER>SCRIBLERIUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Well quit thy posts;—Go make thy flatt'ring court</L>
<L>To Freedom's Sons and tell thy baby fears;</L>
<L>Shew the foot traces in thy puny heart,</L>
<L>Made by the trembling tongue and quiv'ring lip</L>
<L>Of an old gransire's superstitious whims.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MONSIEUR.</SPEAKER>
<L>No,—I never can—</L>
<L>So great the itch I feel for titl'd place</L>
<L>Some honorary post, some small distinction,</L>
<L>To save my name from dark oblivion's jaws,</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="014613_0012_0F94341FC14A0848"/>
I'll hazard all, but ne'er give up my place;</L>

<SPEAKER>BEAU TRUMPS.</SPEAKER>
<L>—That's right Monsieur,</L>
<L>There's nought on earth that has such tempting charms</L>
<L>As rank and show, and pomp, and glitt'ring dress,</L>
<L>Save the dear counters at belov'd Quadril,</L>
<L>Viner unsoil'd, and Littleton, may sleep,</L>
<L>And Coke lie mould'ring on the dusty shelf,</L>
<L>If I by shuffling draw some lucky card</L>
<L>That wins the livres, or lurative place.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>HUM HUMBUG.</SPEAKER>
<L>When sly Rapatio shew'd his friends the scroll,</L>
<L>I wonder'd much to see thy patriot name</L>
<L>Among the list of rebels to the state,</L>
<L>I thought thee one of Rusticus's sworn friends.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEAU TRUMPS.</SPEAKER>
<L>When first I enter'd on the public stage</L>
<L>My country groan'd beneath base Brundo's hand,</L>
<L>Virtue look'd fair and beckon'd to her lure,</L>
<L>Thro' truth's bright mirror I beheld her charms</L>
<L>And wish'd to tread the patriotic path</L>
<L>And wear the laurels that adorn his fame;</L>
<L>I walk'd a while and tasted solid peace</L>
<L>With Cassius, Rusticus, and good Hortensius,</L>
<L>And many more, whose names will be rever'd</L>
<L>When you, and I, and all the venal herd,</L>
<L>Weigh'd in Nemesis, just impartial scale,</L>
<L>Are mark'd with infamy, till time blot out</L>
<L>And in oblivion sink our hated names.</L>
<L>But 'twas a poor unprositable path,</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="014613_0013_0F943420B7047130"/>
Nought to be gain'd, save solid peace of mind,</L>
<L>No pensions, place or title there I found;</L>
<L>I saw Rapatio's arts had struck so deep</L>
<L>And giv'n his country such a fatal wound,</L>
<L>None but his foes promotion could expect;</L>
<L>I trim'd, and pimp'd, and veer'd, and wav'ring stood,</L>
<L>But half resolv'd to show myself a knave,</L>
<L>Till the Arch Traitor prowling round for aid</L>
<L>Saw my suspense and bade me doubt no more;—</L>
<L>He gently bow'd, and smiling took my hand,</L>
<L>And whispering softly in my list'ning ear,</L>
<L>Shew'd me my name among his chosen band,</L>
<L>And laugh'd at virtue dignifi'd by fools,</L>
<L>Clear'd all my doubts, and bade me persevere</L>
<L>In spite of the restraints, or hourly checks</L>
<L>Of wounded friendship, and a goaded mind,</L>
<L>Or all the sacred ties of truth and honour.</L>

<L>Come 'mongst ourselves we'll e'en speak out the truth.</L>
<L>Can you suppose there yet is such a dupe</L>
<L>As still believes that wretch an honest man?</L>
<L>The later strokes of his serpentine brain</L>
<L>Outvie the arts of Machiavel himself,</L>
<L>His Borgian model here is realiz'd</L>
<L>And the stale tricks of politicians play'd</L>
<L>Beneath a vizard fair—</L>

<SPEAKER>BEAU TRUMPS.</SPEAKER>
<L>I think with you—</L>
<L>—unparallelled his effront'ry,</L>
<L>When by chican'ry and specious art,</L>
<L>Mid'st the distress in which he'd brought the city,</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="014613_0014_0F9434214E1911E0"/>
He found a few, (by artifice and cunning,</L>
<L>By much industry of his wily friend</L>
<L>The false Philanthrop—sly undermining tool,</L>
<L>Who with the Syren's voice—</L>
<L>Deals daily round the poison of his tongue,)</L>
<L>To speak him fair—and overlook his guilt.</L>
<L>They by reiterated promise made</L>
<L>To stand his friend at Britains's mighty court,</L>
<L>And vindicate his native injur'd land,</L>
<L>Lent him their names to sanctify his deeds.</L>
<L>But mark the traitor—his high crimes gloss'd o'er</L>
<L>Conceals the tender feelings of the man,</L>
<L>The social ties that bind the human heart;</L>
<L>He strikes a bargain with his country's foes,</L>
<L>And joins to wrap America in flames.</L>
<L>Yet with feign'd pity, and Satanic grin,</L>
<L>As if more deep to fix the keen insult,</L>
<L>Or make his life a farce still more compleat,</L>
<L>He sends a groan across the broad Atlantic,</L>
<L>And with a phiz of Crocodilian stamp,</L>
<L>Can weep, and wreathe, still hoping to deceive,</L>
<L>He cries the gath'ring clouds hang thick about her,</L>
<L>But laughs within—then sobs—</L>
<L>—Alas! my country?</L>

<L>Against the man who made thee what thou art?</L>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>BEAU TRUMPS.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L>I know his guilt,—I ever knew the man,</L>
<L>Thy father knew him e'er we trod the stage;</L>
<L>I only speak to such as know him well;</L>
<L>Abroad I tell the world he is a saint,</L>
<L>But as for int'rest I betray'd my own</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="014613_0015_0F943421F7C44E60"/>
With the same views, I rank'd among his friends;</L>
<L>But my ambition sighs for something more.</L>
<L>What merits has sir Sparrow of his own,</L>
<L>And yet a feather graces the fools cap:</L>
<L>Which did he wear for what himself atchiev'd,</L>
<L>'Twould stamp some honour on his latest heir—</L>
<L>But I'll suspend my murm'ring care awhile;</L>
<L>Come, t'other glass—and try our luck at Loo,</L>
<L>And if before the dawn your gold I win,</L>
<L>Or e'er bright Phaebus does his course begin,</L>
<L>The eastern breeze from Britain's hostile shore</L>
<L>Should waft her lofty floating towers o'er,</L>
<L>Whose waving pendants sweep the wat'ry main,</L>
<L>Dip their proud beaks and dance towards the plain,</L>
<L>The destin'd plains of slaughter and distress,</L>
<L>Laden with troops from Hanover and Hess,</L>
<L>It would invigorate my sinking soul,</L>
<L>For then the continent we might controul;</L>
<L>Not all the millions that she vainly boasts</L>
<L>Can cope with Veteran Barbarian hosts;—</L>
<L>But the brave sons of Albion's warlike race,</L>
<L>Their arms, and honours, never can disgrace,</L>
<L>Or draw their swords in such a hated cause,</L>
<L>In blood to seal a N—'s oppressive laws,</L>
<L>They'll spurn the service;—Britions must recoil,</L>
<L>And show themselves the natives of an isle</L>
<L>Who fought for freedom, in the worst of times</L>
<L>Produc'd her Hampdens, Fairfaxes and Pyms.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But if by carnage we should win the game,</L>
<L>Perhaps by my abilities and fame;</L>
<L>I might attain a splendid glitt'ring car,</L>
<L>And mount aloft, and sail in liquid air.</L>
<L>Like Phaeton, I'd then out-strip the wind,</L>
<L>And leave my low competitors behind.</L>
