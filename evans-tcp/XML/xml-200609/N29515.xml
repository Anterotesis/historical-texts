<P>Yes, Child, and younger too, than thou art: Worth Mr. <HI>Janeway</HI> tells us of a Poor Child, not above five years old, who minded the good of his Soul more then all things in the World; and was greatly affected, by Consider∣ing what would become of him when he should die; and his Dis∣course made Christians stand a∣stonished: He was wonderfully swallowed up with t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e love of Christ, in dying for Sinners, and with Tears would speak of it; be∣fore he was six years old, he made Conscience of secret Duties. And when he prayed, it was with such extraordinary meltings, that his Eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> looked red and sore with weeping for his Sins.</P>
<P>The same Minister gives us an account of another Child, who
<PB N="31" REF="039314_0040_1013FC7647FFBEA8"/>
when she was about four years old had a great sence of her Du∣ty to her Parents, because the Commandment saith, <HI>Honour thy Father and thy Mother.</HI> She would weep if she saw her Parents trou∣bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, (though her self had been no occasion of it) and would of∣ten get into one hole or another to pray, with Tears in his Eyes: She said she believed in Christ, and desired and longed to be with him.</P>
<P>Moreover, He tells us of ano∣ther Child about nine years old whom God graciously wrought upon; her name was <HI>Sarah Hum∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y:</HI> She was very much in secret Prayer; she could scarce speak of sin (or be spoken to abou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it) b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t her Heart was ready to me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he spent much time in reading, and was exceeding dutiful to her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arents; She abhorred Lying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd allowed her self in no know<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

Sin: After she had long waited for an Answer of Prayer, she said, <HI>Well, I will venture my Soul upon Christ.</HI></P>
<P>Nay, He speaks of one that God wrought upon, that was not above three or four years old: This Child, he saith, would often∣times complain of the naughti∣ness of his Heart, and was trou∣bled for his w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing thoughts: He was very fearful<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of wicked Company: When he had com∣mitted a Fault, he was easily con∣vinced of it, and would get in some corner or secret place, and with Tears beg pardon of God. This Child also abhorred Lying with his Soul: When other Chil∣dren were a playing, he would many times and oft be a Pray¦ing.</P>

<P>Yea, doubtless God hath allowed of some Ornament, <HI>Gen.</HI> 24. 23. <HI>Isai.</HI> 61.10. But what∣ever pretends to Ornament, which is inconsistent with <HI>Modesty, Gra∣vity</HI> and <HI>Sobriety,</HI> or is not accor∣ding to <HI>Godliness,</HI> is instead of an Ornament, a Defilement. <HI>Mo∣desty</HI> will teach you not to expose those parts to view, which no necessity, no good end nor use can justifie: Who dares <HI>plead</HI> for that which exposeth persons to S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ares and Temptations, and Religion to shame and reproch? Some now-a-days that attend on Ser∣mons in Christian Assemblies, do more become Play Houses, and yet brasen it out in the face of the Pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cher! O horrid Impudence! <HI>Godliness</HI> teaches not to lay out so much Money to adorn the Body,
<PB N="44" REF="039314_0053_1013FCDA6CCE0FF0"/>
when so many poor Families want Bread; and not to expend foo∣lishly on Superfluities on the Car∣kass, when some poor Children of Christian People want neces∣sary Cloathing. Besides, all Chil∣dren should be contented to go in Apparel, according to the De∣gree, Quality and Ability of their Parents.</P>
<P>My Daughters, and such of you that fear God, pray consider the Rule laid down by the Apostle, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.2, 3, 4. for Regulating Ornaments, is, That they be con∣sistent with a chast Conversation; may, visibly consistent: <HI>Whilst they behold your chaste Conversation, &amp;c.</HI> That pure vestal fire (saith one) of <HI>Chastity,</HI> that burns upon the Altar of a holy Heart, must flame out and shine in <HI>Chastity</HI> of Words, Actions, Cloathings, and Orna∣ments: For when God commands Chastity, he commands whatso∣ever

<P>No degree of Wealth can justifie those Garbs which speaks out Pride and vain-glory; yet Richer (if comely) Ornaments may be lawful in some, that are not in anothers: But let the Rich see they are Rich in good Works▪ and that they do not shew they love their Sons and Daughters more then Christ: Some care not what they bestow on their Chil∣dren who can spare but little to Christs Poor, his Church, and painful Ministers.</P>
<P>But I hope I need say no more of this, concern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng vain Garbs and Fashions to some of you; for it rejoyces my Heart to see how you labour to adorn your Profes∣sion
<PB N="46" REF="039314_0055_1013FCDDE25CD830"/>
in every respect. But as for you, my little Daughters, I have many thoughts and fears concer∣ning you and shall, till I see Christ formed in you. I exhort you to remember what I have said to your Brothers; and endeavor to learn of one <HI>Mary Warren,</HI> born in <HI>May</HI> 1651. aged ten years, who had a blessed Work of Grace begun upon her Soul, and gave clear evidence of a victory over Sin and Satan; who when she was asked, whether she was willing to die? replyed, <HI>Ay, very willing; for then I shall sin no more: For (said she) I know Christs Blood hath made satisfaction for my Sins, &amp;c. I am a Brand pluckt out of the fire, and Christ will put on me his Robes of Righteous∣ness.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, there was one <HI>Mary</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not five years old, who was greatly affected in hearing the
<PB N="47" REF="039314_0056_1013FC9021B23C68"/>
Word of God, and would weep bitterly to think what would be∣come of her Soul in another World: She was often observed to be in secret Duty, and many times came off of her knees with tears: she was also (saith my Author) greatly afraid of Hypo∣crisie, and of doing any thing to be seen of Men to get Commenda∣tion or Praise: Her Book was her delight; and O that this little Book may be so to you! She was greatly concerned for the Souls of others, to think of their mise∣rable condition; and wonderful∣ly affected with the love of God to her. Come, my Children here are Examples for you; one of you is much older then she was; but how little do you mind these things! What pity is it that such tender Branches as you are, when grown up, should go to Hell! Ah! that you would remember
<PB N="48" REF="039314_0057_1013FCE0A77D4C78"/>
why you were made, and why re∣deemed by Christ's most precious Blood! My Prayers are and shall be to God for you. Moreover, I would have you get that little Book, called, <HI>A Token for Children,</HI> and another, called, <HI>A Looking Glass for Children:</HI> Next to your Bible, pray read in them pretty Books.</P>

<PB N="56" REF="039314_0065_1013FCEF2849F700"/>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then Father, if you please to hear me, It is clear and evi∣dent, since Miracles are no where to be found, if the Scripture be not our Rule, or of Divine Au∣thority, God has left us no cer∣tain Rule at all; and that infinite Wisdom should deal thus with Mankind, is absurd and unreason∣able to conceive. But I have one Argument more: If the Scrip∣tures be not the Invention of Men, then it must be from God alone: If of Men, they must either be good Men or bad Men. Good Men they could not be; for no∣thing could be more opposite to Goodness, nay to common Hone∣sty, than to assume the Name of God, and falsly feign Miracles, and cheat People of their Souls. Again, on the other hand, bad Men could not be the Devisers of so holy a Book; can any Man think, that wicked Deceivers
<PB N="57" REF="039314_0066_1013FC9EA1CFB748"/>
would so highly advance the Glo∣ry of God? Would they so abase themselves, and brand and stig∣matize their own Practices? Could such an admirable Righte∣ousness, and Self-denial, as runs through a very vein of the Scrip∣tures, proceed from the Inven∣tion of wicked Men? Would they have laid such a design against the Flesh and all worldly Happiness? Now if we can't gather Grapes of Thornes, nor Figgs of Thi∣stles, then we may be sure no ill Men had any hand in writing and promoting this Good and Holy Bible.</P>

<HEAD>Concerning Prayer.</HEAD>
<P>Quest. <HI>WHat is Prayer?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Prayer is the pouring forth of the Desires of the Soul to Almighty God, or an hum∣ble asking of God such things as we need, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 1.15.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>What Rule hath God given to direct his People in Prayer?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> The whole <HI>Word of God</HI> is of use to direct us in <HI>Prayer,</HI> but the special Rule is that form of Prayer which Jesus Christ taught his Dis∣ciples, <HI>Mat.</HI> 9.6.</P>
<P>Qu. <HI>May all Persons (Sinners as well as Saints) use those words, or pray so as Christ taught his Disciples?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> No verily, Ungodly and Sinners ought not so to Pray.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>Why so?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Because they cannot go to God as to a Father, they may Pray
<PB N="105" REF="039314_0114_1013FD77D6398F58"/>
to him as to a Merciful Creator; but not as to a Father, because they are not his Children; also, they cannot Pray, <HI>Forgive us our Trespasses, as we forgive them that Trespass against us,</HI> because many of them do not forgive such who Trespass against them.</P>
<P>Qu· <HI>Must Children Pray to God?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Yea, they and all others by all means ought to pray, for Prayer is a Branch of Natural Religion.</P>
<P>Qu. <HI>Ought Parents to Teach their Children a form of Prayer?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Parents ought to give Di∣rections to their <HI>Children</HI> how they should Pray, and what they should Pray for, &amp; exhort them to Pray; but we do not read in Scripture, that any of Gods Servants taught their Children a form of Prayer.</P>
<P>Qu. <HI>What kind of Directions are necessary for Parents to give their Children upon this account?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> They ought to command
<PB N="106" REF="039314_0115_1013FD39DF6D8458"/>
them to Cry to the Real and Mer∣ciful God, in a Humble and Reve∣rent manner to shew them their lost &amp; undone Condition without Christ, and to give them Wisdom and his Heavenly Grace to renew his Image in them, lost by the Fall of <HI>Adam,</HI> and to bestow these and all other good things upon them for Christs sake.</P>
<P>Qu. <HI>How should God's Children Pray, according to those Directions given in the Lord's Prayer?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> From the Preface, <HI>Our Fa∣ther which art in Heaven</HI>; we learn to draw near to God with holy Reverence, as Children to a Fa∣ther, able and ready to help us; and that we ought to Pray for all God's Children likewise; 'tis not said, <HI>O Father,</HI> nor <HI>my Father,</HI> but <HI>Our Father</HI>; we must bear all the Saints upon our Hearts when we Pray, <HI>Psal</HI> 64.1.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>What are we taught to Pray for in the first Petition?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="039314_0116_1013FD7DE00CE908"/><HI>Ans.</HI> In these words, <HI>Hallowed be thy Name,</HI> we are taught to glo∣rifie God in all his Attributes, or howsoever else he is made known to us and that every thing may ten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to his own Glory, and to seek his Glory before our own good.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>What do we desire in the second Petition?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> In the second petition <HI>Thy Kingdom come,</HI> we are taught to Pray that God would destroy the the Kingdom of Satan, that so the Kingdom of Grace may come with power upon our Hearts; and that rhe Kingdom of Glory, or God's Visible Kingdom may be hastened and set up with power in the World, <HI>Psal.</HI> 68.1. <HI>Psal.</HI> 51.18▪ <HI>Dan.</HI> 7.27.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>What are we directed to to pray for in the third Petition?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> In the third Petition, <HI>Thy Will be done,</HI> we are taught to Pray that God by Grace would help us
<PB N="108" REF="039314_0117_1013FD3EF9759840"/>
to do (and submit to) his Will in all things, as the Angels do it in Heaven.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>What is it we desire or are to Pray for in the fourth Petition?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> In the fourth Petition, <HI>Give us this day our daily Bread,</HI> we are taught to Pray that God would give us all things which are needful for us in this Life; by which we acknowledge God to be the Fountain of all Earthly Mercies of Good Things, as well as of Spiri∣tual, <HI>Psal.</HI> 90.17. <HI>Acts</HI> 1.727.</P>
<P>Quest <HI>What do we Pray for in the fifth Petition?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> In the fifth Petition, <HI>And forgive us our Trespasses, as we forgive them that Trespass against us,</HI> we are taught to ask Forgiveness or Pardon of God, <HI>viz.</HI> that he would through the Attonement Christ hath made by his Blood, forgive us all our Sins, and impute Christs Righteousness to us by Faith, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.23. and not only to beg pardon,
<PB N="109" REF="039314_0118_1013FD7F6445E768"/>
but also the sence or sight of Par∣don and Forgiveness.</P>
<P><HI>Quest. What do we ask of God in the sixth Petition?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> In the sixth Petition we are taught to beg of God that he would not suffer us to fall into such a State or Company, that may <HI>lead us into Temptation</HI> to Sin a∣gainst God.</P>
<P>Qu. <HI>What doth the Conclusion of this Prayer teach us?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> The Conclusion of this Prayer which runs thus, <HI>For thine is the Kingdom, the Power and the Glory for ever, Amen,</HI> doth teach us to ascribe all Praise and Glory to God, whose Power, Kingdom &amp; Glory is over all for ever and ever, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.20. 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 29.11. 2 <HI>Tim</HI> 2.13</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>How oughtest thou to Pray then, doest thou learn from hence and other Scriptures in general?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> I learn▪ that we ought to
<PB N="110" REF="039314_0119_1013FD4083E7D508"/>
Pray in the Spirit, that my Spirit must Pray; &amp; that too, by the help of the holy Spirit of God; ad that I ought to Pray with Under∣standing. And moreover, we must Pray in Truth, <HI>viz.</HI> Speak no more with our Tongues, then doth agree with our Hearts; and that we ought to lift up holy Hands, Pray with an Heart set against, hating and loathing all manner of Sin and Evil, &amp; to Pray fervently, in Faith, Constantly, and to Pray according to the Will of God, &amp; to put up all Prayer in the Name of Jesus Christ. And lastly, That we ought in the first place to seek the Honour of God before our one good, and to seek the good of our Souls before the good of our Bodies; and that we should in Prayer design &amp; seek the good of others, as well as our own good.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>How is Jesus Christ Our
<PB N="111" REF="039314_0120_1013FD8103E36450"/>
Mediator made known or manifested to us?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Negatively, our Mediator is not made known by the Works of Creation, nor by the Light which is in all men; by the visible things that are made, we may know there is a Creator, yet hereby we can't know there is a Redeemer or Mediator, who was Born of the Virgin, Crucified, Dead and Buried, Raised again, and ascended into Heaven; there∣fore in the Affirmative, Christ (as our Redeemer) is only made known by the Divine Revelation of the holy Scripture.</P>

Infinit and Admirable Essence, and is unspeakably Glorious in all his Attributes; who by his mighty Power and Wisdom made Heaven &amp; Earth &amp; all things therein.</P>
<P>I also believe in Jesus Christ our Lord, who is the only begotten Son of God, being the brightness of his Glory, &amp; the express Image of his Person; and as he is verily God of the Substance of the Father, so he is truly Man; he took on him the Seed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> being concei∣ved by the holy Ghost; he was Born of the <HI>Virgin Mary,</HI> and was Condemned by <HI>Pontius Pilate,</HI> &amp; that he suffered Death to Redeem me and all those who truly believe in him, and that there is no Re∣mission of Sin but by his Blood; I also believe he Rose again the Third Day, and Ascended into Heaven above, and sitteth now at the right hand of God, to make Intercession for us; and that from

thence he shall come again at the End of the World, to be the judge of the quick and dead.</P>
<P>I also believe in God the holy Ghost, who is one with the Father &amp; the Son, proceeding from them, who is my Sanctifier, &amp; the Sancti∣fier of all the Elect People of God.</P>
<P>I believe likewise that God hath one Holy and Blessed Church on Earth (who are a select People seperated from the evil customs &amp; worships of the World) and I believe the Resurrection of the Dead, the Eternal Judgment with the Life everlasting, <HI>Amen</HI></P>

<HEAD>Of Numeration.</HEAD>
<P>NUmeration teaches how to set down any Number spoken of or proposed; to read it truly when written. To which purpose you are to take notice, that we com∣monly express all <HI>Numbers</HI> by these nine Figures, 1 <HI>One,</HI> 2 <HI>two,</HI> 3 <HI>three,</HI> 4 <HI>four,</HI> 5 <HI>five,</HI> 6 <HI>six,</HI> 7 <HI>seven,</HI> 8 <HI>eight</HI> 9 <HI>nine,</HI> and 0, which is called a <HI>Cypher,</HI> and by some <HI>Nought,</HI> be∣cause of it self it stands for <HI>nothing,</HI> yet encreases the Value of other Figures that stand behind it, in the same manner. Every Figure aug∣ments its proper Value, according to the place it happens to be in, except the first.</P>
<P>Any of the <HI>Nine Figures</HI> in the first place, signifies only its own single <HI>value</HI>; in the second place, so many times <HI>Ten</HI>; in the third place, so many <HI>Hundreds</HI>; in the
<PB N="124" REF="039314_0133_1013FD54A9C68CB0"/>
fourth place so many <HI>Thousands</HI>; in the fifth place, so many <HI>ten Thou∣sands</HI>; in th sixth place, so many <HI>hundred Thousands</HI>; and in the 7th place, so many <HI>Millions.</HI></P>
<P>As for <HI>Example,</HI> In this Num∣ber 1234567, the 7 is barely seven <HI>Ʋnites</HI> or <HI>Ones</HI>; but the 6 in the second place, is <HI>six</HI> times <HI>ten,</HI> that is, <HI>sixty</HI>; the 5 in the third place, is <HI>one hundred Times five,</HI> that is, <HI>five hundred</HI>; the 4, a <HI>thousand times four,</HI> or <HI>four thousand</HI>; the 3, <HI>three times ten thousand</HI>; that is, <HI>Thirty Thousand</HI>; the 2 in the sixth place, is <HI>two hundred Thousand</HI>; and the 1 in the 7th place, is <HI>one ten hundred Thousand,</HI> or a <HI>Thousand Thousand,</HI> which is <HI>one Million.</HI></P>
<P>All which being put together in your Understanding, you must read the aforesaid sum (1234567) thus, <HI>One Million, two hundred thirty four Thousand, five hundred sixty seven.</HI> But this Number, 7654321 (which
<PB N="125" REF="039314_0134_1013FD9240D19458" MS="y"/>
consists of the same Figures, but contrary wise placed) must be read <HI>Seven Millions, six hundred fifty four Thousand, three hundred twenty one</HI>; so 9010400, is <HI>Nine Millions, ten Thousand, four Hundred.</HI></P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>Of Addition.</HEAD>
<P>ADdition is that part of Arith∣metick, which shews to col∣lect or add divers Sums together▪ and to express their total Value in one Sum.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Example</HI>; Suppose you had disbursed for your Master the Sums of Money following; as,

</LIST></P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="039314_0135_1013FD562DC214B0"/>Now to know how much the Total of this is, you must add them up together, beginning at the bottom, say, 2 &amp; 3 makes 5, &amp; 4 is 9, &amp; 5 is 14, which set down underneath; &amp; by that it appears you have disbursed 14 Pounds.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subtraction">
<HEAD>Of Substraction.</HEAD>
<P>THis Rule teacheth to substract a lesser Sum from a greater, and then to know what remains; as suppose you have received of your Master 120 <HI>l.</HI> and have dis∣bursed 75 <HI>l.</HI> &amp; would know what is remaining in your hands: To do this you must first set down the 120 <HI>l.</HI> and under that the 75 <HI>l.</HI> and say, 5 from 0 I cannot, but 5 from 10, and there remains 5: Then say, 1 which I borrowed &amp; 7 is 8, 8 from 12, and there remains 4, which set down; &amp; thereby it will appear you have remaining in your hands 45 <HI>l.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Common <HI>Stops,</HI> to be observed in Writing and Reading.</HEAD>
<P>TRue Pointing is necessary in Writing, to prevent Confu∣sion, and therefore I have set down the most usual Stops or Points, as followeth:</P>
<P>A <HI>Comma</HI> [,] is a Note of sho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> stay or stop in reading.</P>
<P>A <HI>Colon</HI> [:] is a Note of perfect sence, but not of a perfect sentence, because there is more of it behind▪ As for <HI>Example,</HI> Psal. 22.28. <HI>For the Kingdom is the Lords: And he is Governor among t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Nations.</HI> This requires a longer stop or pause than a Comma.</P>
<P>A <HI>Semi-colon</HI> [;] differs not much▪ from a <HI>Colon,</HI> but requires some-what a shorter pause. <HI>E. G.</HI> Psal. 3.5. <HI>I laid me down and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ept; I awaked, for the Lord sustained me.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Period</HI> [.] is a full stop, and is placed at the close of a sentence. As, <HI>Rejoyce evermore. Pray without
<PB N="831" REF="039314_0140_1013FD988CEA2700"/>
ceasing.</HI> Here the stop or pause must be longer, that the Reader may recover his breath, and the Hearer have time to reflect a little on what is delivered, before they proceed to new matter.</P>
<P>An <HI>Interrogation</HI> Point, [?] is placed after the asking a Question. As, <HI>Why do the Heathen rage? And the people imagine a vain thing?</HI> In reading, make near as long a pause here, as at a Period.</P>
<P>A <HI>Parenthesis</HI> () is put to inclose any new clause or matter that is added before a man hath fully ex∣pressed his Mind, the sence being good, if that which is added were left out. As where <HI>Paul</HI> says, <HI>For I know in me, (that is, in my flesh) dwelleth no good.</HI></P>
<P>An <HI>Admiration</HI> [!] is put after words that express something strange, or to be wondered at, as, <HI>O the depth of the Riches, both of the Wisdom and Knowledge of God!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="039314_0141_1013FD5C792800F8"/>The <HI>Apostrophe</HI> ['] is a point made▪ as you see) like a <HI>Comma,</HI> &amp; is set over the place where a <HI>Vowel</HI> is left out, which you often meet with in Verse, to shorten the feet, or to make it run smooth. As <HI>penn'd, heav'ns, sin'd, th'other, 'twas, 'tis,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>A <HI>Hyphen</HI> [-] is a note of Con∣nexion, as, <HI>Law-giver, Pen-men.</HI></P>
<P>An <HI>Index,</HI> thus ☞ is to note something remarkable.</P>
