viewed the Garrison at <HI>Schenectady,</HI> put <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> that night.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 21. The praying <HI>Mohaques</HI> desired Audience of his Excellency, and presented to him the French man, who was then Prisoner, as a par∣ticular Mark of their Affection. In the after-noon his Excellency re∣turned his Answer, and gave them Kettles, Knives, Rum, Drink, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to refresh themselves.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 22. Two <HI>Schackhook Indians</HI> that were sent last fall to the <HI>Ono∣gungoes</HI> with a Belt of Wampum, to with-draw their Hatchets from against the <HI>English,</HI> and turn them against the <HI>French</HI> in <HI>Canada,</HI> came to his Excellency, presenting to him a round Plat of Wampum, with four spots in it, signifying four Castles, and four Propositions which they had to offer.</P>
<P>The <HI>first</HI> was, That the Plat of Wampum came from four Castles of the <HI>Onogungoes,</HI> that there was twelve more, who made one Nation with them, and that they would communicate the Message to the other twelve Castles, and give an answer in the fall.</P>
<P>The <HI>second,</HI> That they were a free People, and do not depend upon the <HI>French,</HI> nor any other Nation: That a French Priest had been among them, desiring them to come over to <HI>Mont. Royal,</HI> and assist the <HI>French</HI> against the <HI>Indians</HI> of the five Nations in this Province, and that they did refuse it, because they had received Protection and former Kind∣nesses from the <HI>Indians</HI> of the <HI>five Nations</HI> and <HI>Christians</HI> of <HI>Albany.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>third,</HI> That they cannot tell how to trust the People of <HI>New-England</HI> when they speak of Peace, and therefore propose it to his Ex∣cellency, the Governour of this Province, to whom they have more faith and credit.</P>
<P>The <HI>last,</HI> They desire his Excellency will please to send a Token, wherein their Agents will confide, and be assured of safety in treating here with his Excellency the next Fall.</P>
<P>Whereupon his Excellency gave them a large Belt of Wampum, wrought with the figure of a Tree at one end, and an Ox at the other, in signification of Protection and Plenty, which they were ordered to present to the sixteen Castles of <HI>Onogungoes.</HI></P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 25 Major <HI>Wessells</HI> returned, with a Letter from Coll. <HI>Pincheon,</HI> and the Depositions of some Women, who had their Scalps taken off by some <HI>Indians,</HI> which were very positive against the Prisoners, and said the People of <HI>New-England</HI> were violent and stiff in their Opinions against them.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 26 His Excellency went and viewed the Garrison at the Flats, gave Orders, and returned in the Evening.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 28. His Excellency having received further satisfaction of the Innocency of our <HI>Indians</HI> from the Murder at <HI>Deerfield,</HI> sent a second Express, with Letters, to Sir <HI>William Phipps</HI> &amp; Coll. <HI>Pincheon</HI> for their Releasement.</P>

<P>I Did not expect to see you before the arrival of the other four Nations, but perceiving you are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> our Affection and Zeal to the service of the great King &amp; Queen of <HI>England</HI>▪ &amp; gratitude for those Marks of favour you have received from their Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esties, I am heartily glad to see you, and well satisfied with the service you have done against the <HI>French</HI> and their <HI>Indians,</HI> by which I perceive you have not lost the antient Courage, since you dare attack them in the face of their Castles.</P>
<P>I am come up according to my Promise, to strengthen the Fronteers, to condole the Dead, and give you more Marks of their Majesties Favour to you, but shall defer the giving those Presents until the other four Nations are come. I accept the Prisoner from you, and shall be always willing that the War be made with Honour, and no Prisoners put to death, but in the heat of Action, unless for such Crimes as do deserve it by Martial Law. I have sent to <HI>New-England</HI> for those of your Nation detained Prisoners there, and hope they vvill be returned.</P>
<P>You may always depend upon my readiness to assist you, if you give me such Notice that I may have time enough to come up to you; You must consider the length of the way, it is 150 Miles by Water, and the Journey depends upon the chance of Winds and Tide, therefore be sure give early Notice.

<P>WHen I saw you in this place last <HI>February,</HI> I proposed to be here early in the Summer, at the time the Bark would run, as you desired. In this I was disappointed, by the Commands of the great King and Queen of <HI>England, &amp;c.</HI> who were graciously pleased to send their Royal Mandate, requiring me, upon receipt of it, to repair unto <HI>Pennsilvania,</HI> and take that Province into their Majesties immediate Care and Government.</P>
<P>I received this Commission in <HI>April,</HI> and the Execution of it took up the remainder of that Month, &amp; all the Month of <HI>May.</HI> At my Return to <HI>New-York,</HI> I found my self indisposed, but in six days I was ready for this Journey. I have taken care to strengthen our Fronteers, with Recruits of Christian Souldiers, and War-like Necessaries.</P>
<P>I formerly told you, and must tell you again, That our Enemies cannot easily hurt us, unless you are careless, and by your Drunkenness <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ble your selves; This is a Vice strictly to be proh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bited and

punished. It is a greater in me to Martial Men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> their Sleep like Death, and so they become an easie Prey <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> though weak Enemy. Let me th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fore desire you to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er and vigilent, then you will alw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a condition to make good your ground, till Relief come, or at least to retreat with Arms in your hand</P>
<P>The Blow you received last Winter, is fresh in our Memories; y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u know it came by a supine watchless Humor of the Brethren the <HI>Mohaq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>,</HI> you also know I marched into Sch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="8 letters" DISP="〈8 letters〉"/>, the same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Enemy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> defeated, not far from it; but that is over, let it c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>on you to for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> future; could I have joyned you before the Engagement, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> appearance, very few, if any, had escaped.</P>
<P>In my last Conference with you, I told you, that some of your Yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Men had killed several Horses of ours near <HI>Sch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nectady</HI>▪ you prom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed me that satisfaction should be made, and that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> should be restrained for the future, in which I hope you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> effectual Care.</P>
<P>In my way to this place I met Intelligence of a b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Murder committed at <HI>Deerfield</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> and that three <HI>Indian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> with this Government were imprisoned there upon suspicion of the Fact; I caused the matter immediately to be examined, and have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> two Expresses to <HI>New-England,</HI> to give them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he best satisfaction that I can gather by such Evidence as appears to me here.</P>
<P>Since my arrival two small parties of the <HI>Mohaques</HI> came in from <HI>Canada,</HI> with some Marks of their Success, by which I observe they retain that Courage, for which they have been so long famed: They brought in one <HI>French</HI> Prisoner, whom they have presented unto me, he informs me, that the Enemy lost eighty men of that party which they had sent last Winter to destroy the <HI>Mohaques</HI> Castles, and that thirty three more wounded were brought into <HI>Mount Royal,</HI> several whereof since dyed, and that the French were upon quitting all their small Forts, to strengthen their great Ones, and withal that they intended to Re-inforce <HI>Cadara<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>qui.</HI></P>
<P>I have receiv'd an Information as if some of the Brethren are wavering, and inclined to a Peace with the common Enemy, I desire to know the truth of that matter, and am assured that such Thoughts must only arise from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>stigation of the Jesuite <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>let,</HI> which some of the Brethren have so long suffered to live amongst them, and whose only Practice i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to delude and betray them, let me therefore advise you to remove that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll Person from amongst you.</P>
<P>I am now come to condole your Dead, and to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you of the Favour of Their Sacred Majesties, the great King and Queen of <HI>England, Scotland, France</HI> and <HI>Ireland, &amp;c.</HI> and in their Royal Names, as their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ervant and Lieutenant here to renew and confirm the antient Covenant Chain not only in behalf of this Province, but those of <HI>New England, Virginia, Maryland</HI> and <HI>Pennsilvania</HI>; and as a Mark of their sacred Majesties Esteem and Value which they have for your Courage and steady Ad∣herence to Their Interest; and as a Seal to this Covenant Chain, which must ever be preserved Inviolable, I have brought you Presents from Their Majesties.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Brother Cajenquirago;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE are involved in a Bloody War, which causes us to sit i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sorrow and grief: And since we are about to speak o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Matters of Import, we clear the Mouth and Throat of the Interpretess, that she may speak our meaning plainly and truly to you. Do therefore give her three Beavers.</P>
<P>Then having repeated some part of his Excellency's Speech to them yesterday, said,</P>
<P><HI>Brother Cajenquiragoe,</HI> We are much rejoyced that the great King and Queen of <HI>England</HI> do take notice of us, so far as to extend their gracious Favours to us, by so considerable a Present, for which we return our hearty Thanks, and more especially for the Guns and Ammunition.</P>
<P>We are glad that our <HI>Brother Cajenquirago</HI> renews and confirms the Covenant Chain, not only between us and this Government, but also for <HI>New-England, Virginia, Maryland</HI> and <HI>Pennsilvania,</HI> which Covenant shall forever be kept inviolable by all the Five Nations as long as the SUN shall Shine. We pray that our <HI>Brother Cajenquirago</HI> may have a watchful Eye, that none of those Collonies hold correspondence with the common Enemy, but use their endeavours to destroy them.</P>
<P>We heard nothing of that which you proposed yesterday concerning the Priest <HI>Millet</HI> living in <HI>Oneyde,</HI> until we came to this Town; we forth∣with made inquiry amongst our Brethren the <HI>Oneydes,</HI> who told us there was an <HI>Indian</HI> sent with Letters to <HI>Canada</HI> by <HI>Millet</HI> the Priest, which surprized us very much.</P>
<P><HI>Brother Cajenquirago</HI>; You are our great Tree, whose Roots extend themselves to the utmost parts of the Government. We desire you may not be disturbed when any of our Prisoners, who are our Slaves, do mis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave themselves, for it shall never be countenanced by us, but all proper Methods shall be taken to prevent the like Mis-behaviour for the future. And in like manner we beg, that care may be taken, that none of the Prisoners you have do any harm, or correspond with the Enemy, as we suspect was done by <HI>Chav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leer Deaux,</HI> and that he was sent to <HI>Canada</HI> with Letters, by some of our Brethren.</P>
<P><HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>other Cajenquirago,</HI> In former times our Propositions were quite otherwi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>: Our Discourses were then of Peace, and giving of Presents to one another, but now the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase is altered. Our Speeches are now of no∣thing but War, prompting one another to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: As for our parts we are resolved to stick close by the War to the last drop of our Blood; and though we are tossed to and fro we will remain stedfast to the last Man, according to our first Conclusion.

<P><HI>Brother Cajenquirago,</HI> You are the great flourishing Tree of our shelter, that keeps the Covenant Chain bright, we have one Request to make, which is, that you will be pleased to stay with us, and not return to <HI>England,</HI> since you are acquainted with our ways and methods; and if there be any thing you have to acquaint the great King &amp; Queen withal, you may write to them, and not go from us, for the King knows you to be a Wise man, and therefore will believe you.</P>
<P><HI>Brother Cajenquiragoe</HI>; We are very glad that the Province of <HI>Penn∣silvania</HI> is come under your Government▪ We pray that you would bring some of their Men hither with their Bowes and Arrows, and Hatchets in their heads; for this is the place of Action which ought to be defended</P>
<P>We are glad that the <HI>Showannoes</HI> (who were our Enemies) d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d make their application to you last Fall for Protection, and that you sent them hither to endeavour a Peace with us, as also, that you have been pleased to send Christians along with them to their Country to conduct them back again; we wish they were come to assist us against the common Enemy.</P>
<P><HI>Brother Cajenquirago</HI>; We beg of you to let us have a Smith and Gun∣stock maker in our Castle, to mend our Arms when they are broken.</P>
<P>Now we have done, only must tell you again, that we are extreamly glad, and roul and tumble in Joy that our great King and Queen have been pleased to enlarge their Favours to us in our greatest Necessities, and that there is so much Unity amongst all the Brethren.</P>

<P>His Excellency also bid them be mindful of what he said to them, and true to the Covenant they have renewed. Which they all promised to observe and keep inviolable.

<P>It was particularly observed, that <HI>Odongaowa,</HI> the long <HI>Oneyde,</HI> who was the only suspected <HI>Indian,</HI> and the most particular Friend of the Jesuite, did rise up, and sing a Song of War, (which after their way is the same with a Vow) that he would now presently go and fight the French, Praying Indians of <HI>Canada,</HI> and promised further to his Excel∣lency, that he would take particular care that no Letters from <HI>Canada</HI> should come to the Priests hands, but would have them secured at their first coming, and sent down to his Excellency to be read, that the Poyson may be discovered, which is hid therein.

<P>Then relating to the Priest <HI>Millet</HI> at <HI>Oneyde,</HI> whom the Brethren of <HI>Oneyde</HI> do still harbour among them.

<P>After the private Conference, his Excellency this Morning did further recommend to the chief Sachims and Captains of the five Nations the necessity of their speedy return to their several Castles, their keep∣ing continual Scouts to observe the Enemy's Motion.</P>

<P>That h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Excellency did not know whether the Enemy's design was to make an Attempt against the uppermost Nations, the <HI>Onondages</HI>▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>neks,</HI> or upon the lowermost, the <HI>Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aques</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.

<P>His Excellency wished them a safe Return and good Success in all their Undertakings against the common Enemy, assuring them of the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat King and Queens Favour; nothing doubting but that all of them,

as Men of Courage and Honour, will stick close to their Majesties Interest, as they have alwayes done since the first settlement of this Country, equal to their Promises, and the Covenant Chain, which they have now renewed; And bid them Farewell.</P>
<P>Whereupon the Speaker of the five Nations, in behalf of them, re∣turned hearty Thanks for his Excellency's great Favours, and his care for their Safety, assuring his Excellency, <HI>That they would strictly observe his Commends, and by their future <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ss and Behaviour against <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Enemy, manifest their true Affections and Z<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> to his Excellency's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Government.</HI> And thereupon made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve Shouts, and took leave</P>

<P>THis is the first time I have seen you since my coming to the Go∣vernment, tho' you are seated near this Garrison, and derive your Protection from it.</P>

<P>But on the other hand, its very unlike Souldiers and dutiful Children, to draw out the whole Force of your Castles to h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t leaving your Women and Children exposed to the Accidents and Hardships which attend a Country engaged in War against so watchful an Enemy as this is.</P>
