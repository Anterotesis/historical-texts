in the Temple, wherein we may take notice of Three things.</P>
<P N="1">1. Here is set forth <HI>the Time</HI> when it was that Christ Preached this Sermon; It's said, <HI>The Last Day, that Great Day of the Fea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t.</HI> What Feast? Why the Feast of Taberna∣cles, that Christ did Preach this Ser∣mon▪ and tis said, <HI>The Last Day, &amp; Great Day of the Feast.</HI></P>
<P>Observe it, The Feast of Taber∣nacles was not kept only One Day, but Many Dayes, even Seven Dayes together. Lev. 23.34. <HI>And the Lord spake unto Moses saying, Speak unto t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Children of Israel, the Fifteenth Day of the Seven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h Month shall be a Feast of Tabernacles for Seven Dayes unto the Lord.</HI> The Fifteenth Day of the Se∣venth Month, which is our <HI>Septem∣ber.</HI> Now for these seven Dayes, the first and the last were kept i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a solemn manner; in the other Day<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

they did Servile work, but not on the first and last Day: And so in <HI>Nehe∣miahs</HI> time, they kept the last Day of the Feast very solemnly: Neh. 8 8 <HI>And they kept the Feast Seven dayes, &amp; on the Eighth day was a solemn Assem∣bly, according to the manner.</HI> The last day, then the People came ge∣nerally into the Temple to hear the Law read unto them, and therefore that last Day was called, <HI>The Great Day of the Feast</HI>: For the People on the morrow were to depart into all parts of the Countrey, as they came from all parts: So here on the las<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Day, the great Day of the Feast, Christ Preached unto them on this Subject.</P>
<P N="2">2. 'Tis set forth by the <HI>Manner of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> in what manner Christ did Preach this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ermon to them. There is a double Circumstance in the Preach∣ing of this Sermon; It's said, Christ

stood, but ordinarily Christ is sai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to sit down: As He sat down in the Ship, but here tis said He stood, that He might be better heard &amp; seen of the multitude. And another thing about the manner of it is, He stood and cryed with a mighty Voice; He did <HI>Extend His Voice</HI> so as all might hear, there being a great Concourse of People; and likewise intimating that He was not afraid of the Peo∣ple, He goes up into the Temple, and there He Cryes it, intimating also that the matter was a weighty matter, which He had then to speak unto them; As if He had said, Now take this word with you, tis a mat∣ter of great Concernment. And that is the Second thing here in the Text.</P>
<P N="3">3. The matter of His Sermon when He stood &amp; cryed so, what He did speak or say? Why this it was, <HI>If any man Thirst, let him come <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto me &amp;

Drink.</HI> This was the sum of His Sermon that He stood up and Cryed or Preached unto the People. Where∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> we have these two particulars.</P>

There is a great deal of the Gospel here in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hese Words, in this general Pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lamation, <HI>If any man be Athirst, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and Drink.</HI> Then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></P>

<P>Whoever being Athirst doth come unto Christ, he shall have a supply, he shall have a full supply; he shall not only taste and sip, but drink a full Draught, his belly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so filled, that as the Word saith, <HI>Out of his belly shall flow Rivers of Living Water</HI>; &amp; not only so, but he shall have a full supply most <HI>freely,</HI> drink most <HI>freely</HI>; He doth not desire Money or Price, but according to that Proclamation, which you have to this purpose, Isa. 55.1. <HI>He every one that Thirsteth, Come ye to the Waters, and he that hath no Money, Come Buy and Eat, yea, Come buy Wine and Milk without Money &amp; without Price.</HI> Come and ye shall

Drink freely, and that for nothing, without Money and without Price. And so, Rev. 22.17. <HI>And the Spirit an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Bride say, Come, &amp; let him that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eareth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay, Come, and let him that is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> come, and whosoever will, let him take of the water of Life freely.</HI> And the Spirit and the Bride say, Come▪ this is held forth freely, to drink freely, and it shall cost you nothing. As now a man that should hold forth Proclamation to all that would come to him and drink what they would, they might come, and might drink freely without charge to them: So here, Our Saviour <HI>Christ</HI> clearly holds forth Grace and Sal∣vation freely; whosoever comes they shall have it freely. Briefly, to open the point and shew;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>What manner of Thirst it is that Chri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t speaks of?</HI> What Thirst is it?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>What is that same coming?</HI> Or,
<PB N="14" REF="039417_0008_1014711EADC22450"/>
How may one that is Athirst come to Christ? You will say, Suppose it be Athirst after the Water of Life, how may I come, or in what way may I come? Or in what way ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I come to Christ? And then;</P>
<P N="3">3. Shew you, <HI>That th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se who being thirsty do come unto Christ, they shall certainly be supplyed to the full</HI>: They shall have drink given them freely, most freely. I shall desire to have respect to the season, and apply my self accordingly, to shew you what we are to understand by this same Thirst: <HI>If any man be athirst, let him come and drink</HI>: What manner of thirst is it?</P>
<P>We are not here to understand it to be a Bodily Thirst, but we are to understand it of a Spiritual Thirst, a thirsting of the Soul, as <HI>David</HI> faith, <HI>My Soul thirsteth for thee, O God, for the living God,</HI> Psal. 42.2. There's
<PB N="15" REF="039417_0008_1014711EADC22450"/>
a thirst of the Soul, as well as a thirst of the Body, &amp; a t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st of the Soul is set forth by the similitude or re∣semblance of the Body; and so by what this thirst of the Body is, we may better understand the resem∣blance of the thirst of the Soul.</P>
<P>There are two things in a Bo∣dily Thirst.</P>
<P N="1">1. There is a sense that the Body feels of want; there is not only a want of moisture, but the Body is sensible of it, it is such a want as is an afflictive want, in the want of it the Body stands in need of a supply: And so you may read concerning <HI>Hagar,</HI> the water being out, she did not know what to do for water, and away▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e goes Crying for her Child▪ and her Child Cryes too, and even ready to pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h for want of water. And so <HI>Sam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> after he had made a great slaughter of the <HI>Philistins,</HI> saith
<PB N="16" REF="039417_0009_101471206E874140"/>
he, <HI>What shall this victory do me good▪ if I want water</HI>? So that it is the sense of the want of something that is needful; and as there is a sense of something, so an ardent and vehe∣ment desire, and longing after th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fulness of that desire: As you read of <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sera, Judg.</HI> 4. that great Gene∣ral begged a draught of water being very thirsty.</P>
<P N="2">2. In the Thirst of the Body, there are not only longing desires, vehe∣ment earnest desires for a supply, but it is altogether unsatisfied till it have something of water or moisture to supply its thirst. As the <HI>Israe∣lites</HI> they must have water whatever comes of it, they must have water, and <HI>Moses</HI> smites the Rock &amp; fetcht water out of it for them. Why;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>First of all,</HI> In the Thirst of the Soul, the Soul is sensible of some Spi∣ritual good thing, he is not only

wanting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and without it, but he is sensible of it: In this thirst of the Soul, there is a deep sense of the want of some spiritual Good thing. <HI>Psal</HI> 63.1, 2, 3 <HI>David</HI> being banish∣ed from the Tabernacle, from the Publick Worship, Oh! saith he, <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Soul thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>steth for God</HI>: He wanted the Ordinances, as he used to have had the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; <HI>That I may see thy Glory in thy Sanctuary</HI> In Isa. 41▪ 17. <HI>Whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the poor and needy seek water, &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is none, &amp; th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir tongue faileth for thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> (a gracious Promise,) s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e what w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt there is when the Soul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> such a case, being so sensible th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is even faint and failing, <HI>I the Lord will hear them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them.</HI> And th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪</P>

So when the Soul that hath wanted some Spiritual Good thing, (being a∣thirst) hath longed vehemently, &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rongly, and been very earnest for it. And then, again;</P>
<P N="3">3. When th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itu∣ally

Thirsty, it is not satisfied with any thing short of that which it finds it stands in need of, of that Spiritual Good Thing, of that Spi∣ritual Mercy. As <HI>Abraham,</HI> he was athirst, his Soul was athirst for the accomplishment of the Promise; well, <HI>Abraham</HI> goes a long while be∣fore the accomplishment of the Pro∣mise, Twenty Years or better, and in the mean while God gives <HI>Abra∣ham</HI> other Promises, but yet he is not satisfied; saith God to <HI>Abraham, Behold, Abraham, I am thy Shield &amp; thine exceeding great<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Reward</HI>: What could <HI>Abraham</HI> desire more than God to be his great Reward, even all▪ and yet saith <HI>Abraham, Lord, what wilt thou give me, and I go Childless</HI>▪ Nothing else but what God promi∣sed him will satisfie him.

<PB N="20" REF="039417_0011_1014712584C47580"/>
One thing have I desired, and that will I seek, it is that which I have thirsted after, and longed for, and nothing shall satisfie me till I have my longing, I have made it the main of my desires, and I will still desir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it. Even as the Woman of <HI>Canaan,</HI> she desired mercy for her Daughter that was possessed of a Devil, she had other mercies, yet she would not be satisfied without she had that Mercy.

the World, suppose he Thirsts for Health, and Strength, or the Life of Relations, or suppose it may be for some Spiritual Mercy, the Perfor∣mance of Spiritual Duties, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ke; whatsoever a man Thirsts for must it be given him?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> It is true indeed, it's not here exprest for whatsoever a man doth Thirst: I suppose Christ doth not mean whosoever Thirsts for the World, or worldly Comforts, or for Spiritual Gifts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for Carnal ends; but Christ means such Mer∣cies &amp; Blessings as do accompany and necessarily tend to the Salvati∣on of the Soul; if any man Thirst for such a Mercy, for that which he calls in the next verse, <HI>The Water of Life,</HI> out of his belly shall flow Ri∣vers of Living Water, who Thirsts so: And He doth more plainly Ex∣press it, ver. 39. <HI>This He spake of the

will not stir a step after him for Cure. Those that are truly Thirsty &amp; have not wherewithal to supply themselves, they are they that will come to Christ. And hence it is that when Christ would stir up those of <HI>Laodicea</HI> to come unto Him, He doth it by shewing them their Spi∣ritual wants; <HI>Thou saist,</HI> saith He, <HI>that thou Standest in need of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n thing, that thou art full, and standest in need of nothing; But I say,</HI> saith Christ, <HI>that thou art Blind, Miserable, and Naked.</HI> First, Christ doth convince them (as it were) of their need of a Thirst, and then holds forth the Water of Life.

Let not any here move Contention, and say, what do you bid us come to Christ, why this holds forth Free Will? Why, know that such Ex∣hortations usually and frequently are in all the Duties that the Holy Ghost requires of us, which He knows we have no strength to do: The Lord calls us to Pray, and it is our Duty so to do; and to Believe, but we have no strength and power of our selves; but we must not stand upon Cavelling and say, it is but Folly for us to be striving, seeing we can do nothing, but it is our Du∣ty to be doing what lies in us to the performance, and wait upon the Lord for His coming in with Powe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. to enable us to perform.

to rely and trust upon Christ in His Grace▪ and in His Promise to have a supply of this same Water of Life, and not to give over &amp; cavil. That is a Second, to shew what way the Soul that is truly Athirst should come to Christ. Then,</P>

And to go no further than the Text, there are Two Things that may help us to discern it, and One is this;</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That if ever the Soul hath drank of the Waters of Life that are held forth, then it was once a Thirst for Christ. For here the offer that Christ makes is to Thirsty Souls, and those who Thirst no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> will not care for coming. And,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Not only Thirsty, but they must also come to Christ. And therefore briefly to hint what I have spoken before.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="32" REF="039417_0017_101471351A540550"/>1. <HI>Consider whether ever you have been truly Thirsty.</HI> And by that you may see &amp; know whether you have truly Drank of this Water of Life. Consider it every one, Hath my Soul been truly Thirsty? The Soul that is truly Thirsty is really sen∣sible of some Spiritual want, that he wants some Spiritual mercy; so sen∣sible as to be Spiritually affected, yea afflicted with the sense of it. As a man that is Thirsty for water, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is so sensible that if he have it not be is afflicted for it; why so let every Soul consider, Well, hath my Soul ever been really sensible of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt of some Saving Mercy, or Truth? Hath my Soul been ever sensible of it? I pray consider it with your own Souls; What saving Grace is it that your Souls have been sen∣sible for the want of? Even afflicted for the want of it? I' ever you
<PB N="33" REF="039417_0017_101471351A540550"/>
have been greatly Thirsty in your Bodies, you have been very sensible. I pray consider, Can you remember that ever your Souls were really sen∣sible so as to be afflicted for the want of some Spiritual Saving Mercy from God?</P>
<P N="2">2. Again; <HI>Consider, if you have b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en Thirsty, whether you have ever found that same strong, ardent, and longing desire after a supply of that spi∣ritual want you are in?</HI> As Pardon of Sin, or Saving Grace: Have your Souls not only been affected, but afflicted from the sense of the want of Grace, being ardently, vehement∣ly, and earnestly longing after it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n you remember at such a time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Body was Thirsty, and you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for Water, and could have drank puddle water, by a good to∣ken, and cannot you remember that your Souls have been longing ve∣hemently
<PB N="34" REF="039417_0018_10147137ACF56E10"/>
longing, most earnestly longing after, and panting after this Spiritual Water of Life, and to have been altogether unsatisfied, without you might have that Spiritual Grace and Mercy, which you have longed for? If a man be Thirsty, he will not be satisfied with a Song, you may sing him a Song, but that will not satisfie him, and give him what you will, he must have that which he longs for, and that which he de∣sires, or nothing. And hath it been thus with your Souls? Consider what I say; Can you say, you have longed for this Grace and the other, for Saving Grace, and the lik<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ Well, but have you not been s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦fied with something else?

of. And then then take that along with all, viz.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Conside<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whether ever you have truly come to Christ?</HI> Suppose you have longed for this and that Mercy, and have been unsatisfied for want of this Mercy, consider of it, Did you ever truly come to Christ? Have you ever been Athirst? Have you ever come to Christ in His Or∣dinances for a supply?

come thus to Christ, even as the Saints have been won<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to come to the Or∣dinances, with a sense of their Spi∣ritual wants? <HI>I will hearken and hear what God the Lord will speak to me for He will speak Peace.</HI> He wanted peace, and he had the sense of the want of peace upon him, now saith he, God will speak peace.

<PB N="37" REF="039417_0019_10146A35251E80A0"/>
When you came this day before the Lord, can you say (between the Lord &amp; your own Souls,) that you came upon the sense of some Spiritual want for your Souls unto the Lord in this Ordinance? Why Brethren, it is a rare thing for to come to Christ in the way of His Ordinances, in the sense of the want of some Spiritual mercy. But,</P>
<P N="4">4. Again, <HI>Consider, have you ever come to Christ in a way of Prayer to ask a Spiritual Mercy &amp; Blessing?</HI> It is true indeed, you will say, you go to God every day for the pardon of sin, &amp; assurance of it; but now have you come to the Lord &amp; asked this Spi∣ritual Mercy &amp; the other, as a Thir∣sty man that is even ready to perish for want of Drink, and to take no∣thing in a way of satisfaction, (what∣soever you have besides,) without you have that you are so sensible of▪</P>
<P N="5">5. And then, <HI>Consider whether you
<PB N="38" REF="039417_0020_1014713CD0C62C98"/>
have ever come to Christ in a way of Faith</HI>? There is the coming to Christ indeed: If ever you would drink of the waters of Life, you must come in a way of Faith. Tho' you have come to the Word, &amp; come in a way of Prayer, yet have you come in a way of Faith, relying and resting &amp; rolling upon Christ in a way of Faith, to be accepted of the Father thro' Him, and so for remission of sins, &amp; whatever saving Benefits you stand in need of? Have you ever came to Christ thus, relying upon Him in his Word, in the invitation He makes there, and in His Promise? This is the way to come to CHRIST. <HI>He that believeth on me, out of his belly shall flow Rivers of living water.</HI> Let us consider of it between the Lord and our own Souls, whether ever we have come to Christ, and so drank of the waters of Life?

Jesus Christ is a full supply, &amp; tho' we may have a notion that in Jesus Christ their is a full supply, yet we have a principle &amp; notion in us, that we have some supply in our selves.

if so be that Jesus Christ were full of the Spirit, and full of Grace, — yet if He were not full as a Fountain, He could not communicate; look now as it is with a Bucket, tho' it may be full of water yet notwithstanding i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hath not the fulness of a Fountain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as it doth supply any it hath so much the less; but Christ now being a Fountain-fulness, tho' he communi∣cate never so much, yet still there is the same fulness.

as before. And so the Saints some of them have been full of the Holy Ghost, (as <HI>Stephen,</HI>) tho' yet notwithstanding, their fulness is not the fulness of a Fountain, and so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey cannot supply the want of o∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hers: As the Wise Virgins, when the Foolish Virgins wanted Oyl, &amp; their Lamps were out, they would have had Oyl of the Wise, but say they, We have none to spare, none to communicate: Why?

unto Christ, &amp; thereupon they have a Communication of His fulness from Union, for Union is the cause of Communication.

As the Head, it is the seat of all the Sensitive &amp; Animal Spirits, &amp; the Head being united to the Body, there is a communication of all the Senses, from the Head to every Member, according to its ca∣pacity. Why now, Jesus Christ He is the Head, we are His Members, Flesh of His Flesh, Bone of His

Bone; we are Members of Him be∣ing joyned to him, and they that are joyned to the Lord are one Spirit: we are by Faith joyned to the Lord; and Jesus Christ is said to dwell in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by Faith. There is a nearer U∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on that the believing Soul hath with Jesus Christ, than any Member hath to the Natural Body, than any Branch hath to a Natural Tree, yea, than our Souls and Bodies have to each other, Joh. 6.56. <HI>He that eat∣eth my Flesh, and drinketh my Blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</HI> Now the nearer we be to a Fountain, the nearer a supply.

it must needs receive a f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll <HI>supply</HI> unto all its wants. That is a Second Demonstration. To take up <HI>one</HI> more.</P>

<PB N="53" REF="039417_0027_10147152E407FFC0"/>
so God hath made the Sun to be Light, not to be Light to its self only, but to communicate and give Light to the World. Why now, there is a full supply in Jesus Christ, He being filled with all ful∣ness, (from the Father,) for this end, to give out to others, to com∣municate. <HI>From His Fulness we have all received Grace for Grace.</HI> He is full of Grace and Truth; Ay, but to what end is He full of Grace and Truth?

And therefore saith the Psalmist, <HI>Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n He ascended on High, He led captivity captive, and received Gifts for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, even for the Rebellious.</HI> He re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ired them for Men, for Rebellious Men, for Enemies unto God, to give <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t and communicate of Grace, as He was Mediator; and therefore now Jesus Christ gives out Grace freely and▪
<PB N="54" REF="039417_0028_1014715489B4E4D0"/>
largely, because it is for that very end He had all fulness given to Him; so that now there is a full supply to be had for all that come to Christ: Christ will fully supply all that come to Him to Drink of the Water <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Life, and He hath never a whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> less. O Brethren, that you were fully perswaded of this Truth, that He is the fulness of all Grace, that so we might know whether to go to be supplyed in all our Spiritual wants: for we are ready to go to oth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r things, rather than unto Christ, to our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and <HI>Duties</HI>▪ and the like, but these are to be used only as <HI>Con∣duits,</HI> to convey supply to us, but not as the supply; but to look unto Christ who hath all supplies, that we may go unto Him to supply us, who only is able to supply us, and fill us to the full with all Grace, whatso∣ever we stand in need of. And then

again, We shall not only have a full supply, but we shall have a supply f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly; Christ will not ask any thing at all of any that comes to Him, but they shall be suppl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed freely from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s fulness.

What shall we say then, that those that make such complaints as these are not true Believers? No, God forbid. Or shall we say that this Truth that Je∣sus Christ hath spoken is not Truth?

And be∣cause I would not speak it a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine own words alone, I speak it as the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> did, when the Angel came to her, Luk. 1.38. <HI>Then said</HI> Mary, <HI>Behold the Servant of the Lord, be it unto me according to thy word.</HI> This was now a Believing, a Trust∣ing, and Relying on the word of

the Lord. She was a Virgin, and the Angel answered her in that, as she had no more to say, but to rely upon the word of Promise, <HI>Behold the Handmaid of the Lord, be it unto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> according <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o thy word.</HI> Whence was it? It was from this Speech, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> holy Confidence and Expectation of the fulfilling of that Promise to her. And so, Effectual Calling is an hearkening unto the Lords Call, the Soul being perswaded to receive the Word, closing with, returning answer to the Word, then the Soul is Eff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctually Called. So also there is an Effectual Call, unto which the Soul doth not answer, but looks up∣on the word of the Lord by His Servants, as words of wind, and words of course: But as this same accepting of this gracious Invitation and Promise, which He holds forth,
<PB N="87" REF="039417_0044_1014717C77B3D3A0"/>
is Effectu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l Calling; why so, I say, the neglecting of these, is a refusing to hear Him that speaks from Heaven. <HI>Take heed that you do not re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>use Him that speaks from Heaven</HI>: That is, Now when the Lord speaks in His Invitation, by Gifts and Outward Calling. This invitation being pro∣pounded and made, and men make light of it, it is an Effectual Calling; so now when upon the invitation of the Call of the Lord in His Promise, there is a yielding Obedience unto that Call in Faith, it's called, <HI>The O∣bedience of Faith</HI>▪ Rom. 16.26. When the Soul doth yield unto the Lord in the voice of the Promise, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>se withal, and receive and embrace it, looking upon it as worthy of all ac∣ceptation, receiving i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with both hands, as it were: When the Soul doth thus venture to rely upon the Word, venturing it self upon the

Lord in His Promise, that if I Pe∣rish I will Perish there, I will venture my self upon the Lords Word and Faithfulness; this is Effectual Calling. 2. Tim 1.12. <HI>I know,</HI> saith <HI>Paul, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whom I have Believed, and I am per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>swaded that He will keep that good t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which I have committed unto Him, a∣gainst that Day</HI>: I have committed my Soul concernments unto Him, and I trust them in His Arms. When the Soul doth venture thus upon His Gracious Word of invitation, doth receive it, and committeth it self unto the Lord in it▪ this is a closing with Christ, and the answer of the heart unto the Lords call, and this is a coming unto Christ. So that when you venture upon the Lord in His word, you close with Him in it; it is soon said▪ yea soon done, the Soul may come <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> close with Christ in the Promise, and that
<PB N="89" REF="039417_0045_1014717ECACC82D8"/>
soon too: so pass from Death unto Life. Therefore ask your own hearts in the presence of the Lord, seeing Jesus Christ doth make such a gracious invitation for to come <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto Him, and venture upon Him in His Word, whether it can be free and ready to say, <HI>Now, Lord let it be according to thy W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd to me.</HI> Say in this manner, as in the presence of the Lord; Lord, Upon this Gra∣cious invitation of thine in the Gos∣pel, I desire to rest and hope upon the Faithfulness of thy Word, and to accept thereof, and trust in it: Can you say it in the presence of the Lord? You, whosoever you are that seem to be afar off, tho' you might have had some glimmering hopes, hoping sometimes that the Lord would be merciful to <HI>you,</HI> &amp; pre∣sently fearing your Eternal condi∣tion.
