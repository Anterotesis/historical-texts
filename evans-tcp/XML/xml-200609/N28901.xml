<HEAD>THE NARRATIVE OF MR. JOHN SOREN.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>☞ IT has seldom happened that the wrongs of an Individual have had a greater claim to the attention of the Public than those which are the subject of the following Narrative. The generous and disinterested conduct of the benefactor has never been more strikingly contrasted with the ingratitude and persidy of the object of his humanity: the national character of Englishmen was never more dishonoured than in the character of Captain Potter of the <HI>Isabella;</HI> and the credit of Government was never more deeply interested in any thing than in taking care that the injuries of <HI>Mr. SOREN</HI> shall not remain unredressed.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. JOHN SOREN, a native of Boston, in the state of Massachusetts, a citizen of the United States of America, and a partner in the house of Holyoke and Soren, in Boston, being, in the month of November, in the year 1795, at Ham∣burgh, freighted an American ship called the <HI>Enterprise,</HI> then lying there, of the burthen of 170 lasts, or 340 tons, on a voyage from thence to Surinam, and from Surinam back to Hamburgh. The ship was the property of Mr. Clough, of Witchcasset, in the state of Massachusetts, also a native and citizen of America. The charter-party was made between Mr. Soren, on behalf of Mr, Holyoke and himself, as freighters, and Wyatt St. Barbe, a native of England, and
<PB N="4" REF="038531_0003_10125093D1776F80"/>
30 years a citizen of America, but then residing at Ham∣burgh, as master and commander of the ship, on behalf of the owner. By that charter-party <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> the Charter-party, Appendix, No. 1.</NOTE>, dated the 24th of Novem∣ber 1795, and regularly attested by a notary-public, the freighters engaged to ship on board the vessel, on her safe ar∣rival at Surinam, a full convenient cargo of West-Indian products, to be brought back to the port of Hamburgh, and to make the Captain's allowance of privilege, as in similar cases: the stipulated freight for the outward and homeward voyage was 2600<HI>l.</HI> sterling, with 15<HI>l.</HI> per cent. primage for the whole ship's hold. The object of Mr. Soren was, to ship at Hamburgh a sufficient cargo fit for the market at Su∣rinam; and, by the produce of that cargo, and by means of letters of credit which he had obtained on Surinam, to the amount of nearly 15,000<HI>l.</HI> sterling in the whole, to purchase, at Surinam, coffee sufficient to load, not only the <HI>Enterprise,</HI> but several other ships, which he intended to freight at Suri∣nam or other ports, the comparative prices of that article, at Surinam and at Hamburgh, at that time affording him the best ground to expect that his adventure would prove a very profitable speculation. In prosecution of this object, he ship∣ped on board the <HI>Enterprise,</HI> at Hamburgh, goods to the amount, in prime cost, of 3200<HI>l.</HI> and upwards<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> the Bills of Lading and Invoice, No. 2 and 3 in the Appendix.</NOTE>, and caused insurances to be effected on them, and on the supposed pro∣fits, by underwriters at Hamburgh, to the amount of 5000<HI>l.</HI> and upwards. Captain St. Barbe at the same time shipped linen, groceries, liquors and glass, on account of himself and Messrs. Furst and Co. citizens and burghers of Hamburgh, to the amount, in prime cost, of 901<HI>l.</HI> 8s. 11d. sterling.</P>
<P>On or about the 5th of February 1796, Mr. Soren sail∣ed in the <HI>Enterprise</HI> on his intended voyage. On the 25th of the same month, being in latitude 44° 1′ north, longitude 18° 35′ west, at one <HI>p. m.</HI> Captain St. Barbe and Mr. So∣ren observed a ship towards the south-west, with an English ensign <HI>reversed,</HI> which they considered as a signal of distress▪ they sailed towards her, and about four o'clock <HI>p. m.</HI> came up with her, and learned she was the <HI>Isabella,</HI> belonging to Messrs.
<PB N="5" REF="038531_0004_101250964319ABB0"/>
Tarleton and Backhouse, of Liverpool, Charles Potter com∣mander; that she had a letter of marque, and had been freighted by the British Transport-office to carry nearly 300 troops from Cork to Barbadoes: she was in a very leaky and almost sinking condition, both pumps incessantly going. The Captain, with one of his mates, came on board the <HI>Enterprise;</HI> and, having shortly informed Captain St. Barbe and Mr. So∣ren of the perilous situation in which he found himself, re∣quested them to see him into Lisbon or Corunna: Captain St. Barbe replied, that to go to either of those places, would be too great a deviation from his voyage; but that, with Mr. Soren's approbation, he would with much pleasure accompany him to Madeira, Teneriffe, or any of the Windward Islands; and render him every service in his power, consistently with the duty he owed to the owners and proprietors of his ship and cargo: Mr. Soren readily assented. Potter seemed re∣joiced at the proposition, and said he would send on board his own ship for the approbation of the commander of the troops<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Captain Mansergh, now Major Mansergh.</NOTE>: he sent his mate accordingly; but not to communicate to the commander of the troops, or to his crew, the humane offer of Mr. Soren and Mr. St. Barbe! The reader will be startled at the relation which follows; he will with difficulty con∣ceive the possibility of a transaction so replete with perfidy and ingratitude: it is nevertheless true, and can be established be∣yond contradiction by the testimony of all the officers of the troops then on board the <HI>Isabella</HI> who are now alive: This monster in human shape, without a shadow of proof, without the slightest ground of suspicion, without having seen a single article of the cargo, or a single paper, without having had any communication with any one on board but Captain St. Barbe and Mr. Soren, at the very moment when he was expressing his thanks for their kindness, which was to rescue him, his passengers and crew, from almost inevitable destruction, had conceived the diabolical project of making prisoners of his benefactors, and seizing their ship as a prize! He whispered to his mate; the mate obeyed the suggestion: he returned on board the <HI>Isabella</HI>; he brought back with him on board the
<PB N="6" REF="038531_0005_10125098AAF8A410"/>
<HI>Enterprise</HI> a party of soldiers and sailors, with musquets and bayonets fixed: Potter, on their arrival, insisted the ship was French; that the cargo consisted of French and Dutch pro∣perty; that the Captain must be a Frenchman, because his name was "<HI>St. Barbe;</HI>" and that Mr. Soren had two sets of papers! Remonstrance was vain: the miscreant took pos∣session of the ship as a prize; made Mr. Soren and the chief mate, the carpenter, and eight of the seamen, prisoners; and drove them, with pistols cocked at their breasts, and at the point of the bayonet, out of their own ship into the <HI>Isabella,</HI> which was every moment in danger of sinking!</P>
<P>It was afterwards learned, that Captain Potter, when the <HI>Enterprise</HI> approached the <HI>Isabella,</HI> represented to the officers of the King's troops that she was an enemy, and was bear∣ing down upon them in order to attack; that the officers, ob∣serving her inferior size, the small number of men on board, and no appearance of guns or of warlike preparation, reasoned with him against this representation; that, nevertheless, and notwithstanding the perilous condition of his own ship, he or∣dered the guns to be got ready, and the soldiers to be arrayed on deck, ready for an attack; and that it was this circum∣stance which enabled him, with such promptitude and facili∣ty, to obtain from the officers the party of soldiers who took possession of the <HI>Enterprise.</HI></P>
<P>When Mr. Soren arrived on board the <HI>Isabella,</HI> and stated the circumstances of his situation, and the manner in which he had been treated by Potter, the officers of the troops, whose humanity and polite attention to the sufferers reflects on them the highest honour, reprobated in the severest terms the in∣human conduct of Potter; and Captain Mansergh, the com∣manding officer, declared, that had he known the real cir∣cumstances of the case when Potter sent to him for a detach∣ment, he would not have permitted it to go.</P>
<P>Potter having, in the manner before stated, taken possession of the <HI>Enterprise,</HI> continued on board her till the following day, when he obliged Captain St. Barbe to deliver up to him, as well the greatest part of the ship's papers, and those relating to the cargo, as many others of a private nature: after ex∣amining them, he began to rummage the hold; and, after
<PB N="7" REF="038531_0006_1012509B14D5FC00"/>
breaking open several cases and boxes, took out gin, provisions, and whatever he thought proper, and afterwards gave them to the guard of soldiers, in whose charge he left the ship.</P>
<P>When he returned on board the <HI>Isabella,</HI> the officers of the troops remonstrated with him on the impropriety of his con∣duct, and advised him to release the <HI>Enterprise,</HI> as there was not the slightest colour for his taking her as prize: he told them that it was no business of theirs; that they were only passengers; produced his letter of marque, which, however, only comprehended <HI>French</HI> property; that his owners, Messrs. Tarleton and Backhouse, were persons of property, and were responsible for his conduct; and that, if, through the inter∣position of the officers, he should be obliged to part with his prize, they must answer to his owners. In addition to what he had said the day before, he declared, what was most cer∣tainly false, "that he knew St. Barbe well, that he was a rogue, and that, if he had him in England, he had papers sufficient to hang him."</P>
<P>Mr. Soren represented to him, that after the humanity of Mr. St. Barbe, manifested to him and nearly 300 persons on board his vessel, his conduct was reprehensible in the ex∣treme; and requested, as he was completely in his power, that he might be permitted to return to the <HI>Enterprise,</HI> rather than remain, on board the <HI>Isabella:</HI> Potter replied, that Mr. Soren was his prisoner, and that he would conduct the two ships to the Rock of Lisbon, and from thence send the <HI>Enter∣prise</HI> to Barbadoes for condemnation. Mr. Soren then repre∣sented to him, that he acted in open defiance of the law of na∣tions, and in direct violation of the treaty lately concluded between Great Britain and America; and desired that he would, as he proposed, direct the ship's course to Lisbon, where they might both have ample justice done to their cause. Potter then shifted his ground; he pretended that he could not reach Lisbon. The officers of the troops desired that he would steer for Madeira, to which Captain St. Barbe had at first offered to accompany him: to this he apparently agreed; but steered to Teneriffe.</P>
<P>When arrived at Teneriffe, Mr. Soren requested his per∣mission to go on shore: the answer was, "You may jump in∣to
<PB N="8" REF="038531_0007_1012509CD56E7EF8"/>
the sea, if you like it; but neither you nor Captain St. Barbe shall go on shore till the arrival of the British Consul." That gentleman was then at the Grand Canary. Captain Mansergh interposed, and almost by force took Mr. St. Barbe on shore with him in his boat; they applied to the Governor of Teneriffe, and, by their representation, obtained an order for Mr. Soren's being also permitted to land. In consequence of this order, Mr. Soren, after having been detained upwards of twenty-four hours, landed on Teneriffe, literally a stranger, without money, without friends, stripped of every thing, his gold watch<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The watch was afterwards restored, with five guineas of his money, by the good offices of Captain Mansergh.</NOTE>, his cash, all his private property, except a few articles of wearing apparel!</P>
<P>In a few days, the British ship <HI>Isabella</HI> was condemned, as incapable of proceeding on her voyage. The fact, on inquiry, turns out to be, that this ship was upwards of thirty years old, and, at the time when she was freighted to Government, was unfit to be sent to sea; and had it not been for the continued exertions of the soldiers at the pumps, and, even notwith∣standing those exertions, had she met with a severe gale of wind, she must have gone to the bottom.</P>
<P>On the second day after the arrival at Teneriffe, Captain Potter began to tranship from on board the <HI>Isabella,</HI> on board the <HI>Enterprise,</HI> military stores and baggage, and to unstow the cargo of the <HI>Enterprise,</HI> breaking open some packages, and starting others, for the purpose of sitting up births for the ac∣commodation of the soldiers, who, to the number of 150, with women and children, beside the crew of the <HI>Isabella,</HI> were afterwards embarked on board the <HI>Enterprise,</HI> on which Porter hoisted the British jack ensign and flag. During the detention of the <HI>Enterprise</HI> at Teneriffe, through the wanton∣ness of Potter and his crew, she experienced almost every spe∣cies of injury, and was so much damaged, that when she ar∣rived at Barbadoes she was much reduced in value.</P>
<P>While at Teneriffe, application was made by Captain St. Barbe to Peter Favene, Esq. the British Consul there, for an investigation of Potter's conduct. That gentleman, though fully satisfied, from the perusal of the documents produced,
<PB N="9" REF="038531_0008_1012509F9B816990"/>
that there was no foundation for seizing the <HI>Enterprise</HI> as a prize, and though he strongly reprobated the conduct of Pot∣ter, yet declined to interpose, from an opinion that, as Con∣sul, he had no power to make the required investigation; and referred the parties to a regular Court of Admiralty at Barbadoes, whither Potter said he intended to carry the ship for condemnation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Mr. Favene's Letter to Charles Long, Esq. Secretary to the Trea∣sury.—Appendix, No. 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On the voyage to Teneriffe, Potter, by plying the sailors of the <HI>Enterprise</HI> with liquor, and by promises, endeavoured to prevail on them to give evidence that the <HI>Enterprise</HI> was a French or Dutch ship. Finding his atttempts by entreaties ineffectual, he put them on an allowance of bread and wa∣ter, and, even of these, a <HI>scanty</HI> allowance. By this treat∣ment the health of the mariners was much injured, and more particularly that of the carpenter, who, in addition to other ill-treatment, was kept in irons, as a punishment for refusing to swear to the effect Potter wished him to do. With two only was he able to succeed, who afterwards declared they were induced from threats and ill treatment, and that what they had been prevailed upon to depose was false, and extort∣ed from them in the hopes of obtaining an alleviation of their sufferings.—As a proof that his understanding was as weak as his heart was wicked, he also attempted to tarnish the honour of the British military, who certainly do not hold in light estimation that delicate point, by promising them a share of the prize, as he termed it, with him; they disdainfully re∣fused his offer, and expressed their united disapprobation of his conduct in manly and unequivocal terms.</P>
<P>Previous to the departure of the <HI>Enterprise</HI> for Barbadoes, Mr. Soren requested Potter to permit him to have his private effects, not forming a part of the cargo: he refused to restore a single article, except some private letters of trifling import∣ance. He carried his brutality farther: he refused Mr. So∣ren a passage to Barbadoes, "unless he would go in the <HI>com∣mon way;</HI>" in other words, "unless he would go in the steer∣age; and he turned Mr. St. Barbe, who, with Mr. Harlow his mate, proceeded to Barbadoes, out of his state room, not∣withstanding
<PB N="10" REF="038531_0009_101250A2CB772E40"/>
the remonstrances of the British officers that he ought to be permitted to remain in possession of it.</P>
<P>Mr. Soren being refused a passage in the <HI>Enterprise</HI> in a decent way, was advised by Captains Mansergh and Thomas to leave the conduct of the business at Barbadoes to Mr. St. Barbe, and to come himself to England, where it was sup∣posed he might obtain redress for the injuries he had sustain∣ed. How far this supposition was well-founded, will be seen in the sequel.</P>
<P>On the 25th of March 1796, Potter sailed in the <HI>Enter∣prise</HI> from Teneriffe, and, on the 16th of April following, arrived in Carlisle Bay, Barbadoes. Potter then exhibited a libel against the ship and cargo, as prize, in the Vice-Admir∣alty Court there; to which a claim was entered by Captain St. Barbe, on behalf of himself and the owner of the ship, and the several persons interested in her cargo; and a petition was preferred by him to the Judge of the Court, praying that the libellant might be compelled to give security for costs, in case the ship and cargo should not be condemned as good and law∣ful prize. This petition, after argument of counsel, was granted, and Potter not giving security as ordered, the libel was dismissed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> the Proceedings of the Court, Appendix, No. 5, (A.)</NOTE>; on which Mr. St. Barbe petitioned the Court for damages. Potter filed a petition, praying that an attachment might issue against the ship and cargo, alleging that sufficient evidence had been obtained to prove them the property of an enemy, until he or the King's Advocate-Ge∣neral should proceed further against them: this petition being granted, a libel was filed by the King's Advocate-General against the ship and cargo as a droit of the Admiralty; and this on the very day appointed for the investigation of the merits of Captain St. Barbe's petition for damages <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> the Affidavit of Captain St. Barbe, Appendix, No. 6.</NOTE>. To this libel Captain St. Barbe also put in his claim on behalf of himself and the owner of the ship and proprietors of the cargo; and the case being heard, the ship and cargo were ordered to be restored <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> the Proceedings of the Court, Appendix, No. 5, (B.)</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="038531_0010_101250A53095A328"/>Captain St. Barbe wished then to renew his petition for damages; but he was advised by his counsel that it would be to no purpose, as Potter had in the mean time absconded, and had no property within the reach of the Court, and as the King's Advocate paid no damages <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Captain St. Barbe's Affidavit, Appendix, No. 6.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It has been stated that Potter had plundered the ship; he had expended a great quantity of the stores; many perishable articles were completely spoiled; the dry goods which remain∣ed unplundered, were much damaged; the ship had been robbed of great part of her materials, and was otherwise much injured; the worm had got into her bottom; and Captain St. Barbe found it absolutely necessary to proceed to Alexandria in America, to have her sheathed and repaired. When she had undergone such repairs, which amounted to between 3000<HI>l.</HI> and 4000<HI>l.,</HI> he returned with her to Hamburgh, the place to which she was to have returned after she should have made her voyage to Surinam.</P>
<P>Before the ship's departure from Barbadoes, the remainder of her cargo, from the depredations of Potter, was sold for 2779<HI>l.</HI> 8<HI>s.</HI> 0¾<HI>d.</HI>; from which, deducting the expences of sale, amounting to 270<HI>l.</HI> 3<HI>s.</HI> 1½<HI>d.</HI> there remained the sum of 2509<HI>l.</HI> 5<HI>s.</HI> 5¼<HI>d.</HI> Barbadoes currency; in sterling money, 1756<HI>l.</HI> 9<HI>s.</HI> 9¾<HI>d.</HI>; a loss being thus sustained of 2349<HI>l.</HI> 12<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> on the prime cost of the cargo at Hamburgh. The loss on the whole of this transaction, to Captain St. Barbe and his owner, and to Mr. Soren and his partner, amounted in the whole to 11,553<HI>l.</HI> 19<HI>s.</HI> 8½<HI>d.</HI> sterling <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> the Statement in the Appendix, No. 7.</NOTE>, independently of the loss of the voyage, and the probable advantage which might have accrued from it.</P>
<P>When Mr. Soren was informed of what had passed in the Vice-Admiralty Court at Barbadoes, he directed Captain St. Barbe to apply to the Underwriters at Hamburgh, from whom he received the following answer:—
<Q>You are not entitled to recover, inasmuch as, having borne down to the relief of his Majesty's transport, laden with troops, in distress, you altered the ship's regular course, and deviated from
<PB N="12" REF="038531_0011_101250A79B8D6BC8"/>
the voyage on which you made the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>urance.</Q>
—To the credit of the character of the British merchants, Mr. Soren has been informed by several Gentlemen at Lloyd's, that he would not have received such an answer from the Under∣writers at that place.</P>
<P>Mr. Soren was now advised to have his case drawn up, and submitted to the opinion of Counsel. A case was ac∣cordingly prepared, and laid before Mr. Gibbs, one of His Majesty's Counsel: In this case it was stated, that, on the sailing of a letter of marque, security is given for any damage or injury which may be done to any of His Majesty's subjects, or of foreign states in amity with His Majesty; and that, in the case of the <HI>Isabella,</HI> a bond had been given in the penalty of 1500l.—and the following Query was put:</P>
<P><Q>What steps ought the unfortunate sufferers to pursue to seek redress for their several injuries? Must such redress be sought by actions at law against Messrs. Tarleton and Backhouse, the owners of the letter of marque, as Potter, the commander of her, is run away? And will such actions lie? And in that case, and on separate actions being com∣menced, cannot Soren, St. Barbe, and Clough, be evidence for each other, as to the extent of the injuries suffered se∣verally? And is the bond for 1500l., given by Jordan, Kembie, and Sowerby, assignable for the benefit of the sufferers? And, ought an application to be made to the Lords of the Admiralty in this case, or whom else, by pe∣tition or otherwise, to direct the same to be put in suit? And, upon the whole, point out what steps they ought to take to seek effectual redress; and, if actions are maintain∣able, what evidence will be necessary to support such actions.</Q></P>
<P>The following is a copy of Mr. Gibbs's answer:—
<LETTER>
<P>This is a case of most dreadful hardship upon those whose property has been thus attacked; but it appears to me that the Vice-Admiralty Court at Barbadoes, when they determined that the ship and cargo were no prize, and ordered them to be restored, ought to have decreed a com∣pensation for the loss sustained by the capture; and after the case of Le Caux and Eden <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Doug. Rep. 57<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> (594.)</NOTE> in Douglas, I take it to

have been settled, that no action will lie in any of our Common-Law Courts for the recovery of such compensa∣tion. The question of <HI>Prize or no Prize?</HI> is exclusively of Admiralty jurisdiction, and draws with it, as an inci∣dent, the question of compensation for the injury occasion∣ed by the capture. I think that this objection extends also to the suit on the bond.</P>

<P>The statement of the case was also laid before Sir William Scott, then the King's Advocate-General, who gave his opi∣nion in the following terms:—</P>
<Q><TEXT>
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="opinion">
<P>The application of the parties in this case ought to have been to the Court of Vice-Admiralty for costs and damages, it being the proper duty of that Court, not only to make restitution where it is due, but likewise to decree costs and damages when the capture was grossly improper. If the Judge refuse improperly to decree costs and damages, an appeal lies from that refusal; but I do not think that any common law jurisdiction either can or will examine the question whether the capture was unjust or not: it is a question merely of Admiralty cognizance; and if the Court of Admiralty or Court of Appeals has not decreed it to be an illegal seizure, a Court of Common Law will not take upon itself to pronounce such a judgment. I must observe, that a decree of restitution does by no means infer that the original seizure was illegal and violent; for there may be just cause of seizure, although the property may, upon further inquiry, be restored.</P>
<P>I am of opinion that the decree, standing as it does, unaccompanied with costs and damages, must be taken <HI>in all Courts</HI> to imply that costs and damages were not due; and this imputation is the stronger against the claimants for their not demanding them; for, if they did not demand costs and damages in the proper jurisdiction in which they ought to be awarded, the inference would be, not only that costs and damages were not due, but that they were not due <HI>in the opinion of the claimants themselves,</HI> who did not so much as venture to ask them.—Upon these grounds, I am

<P>In consequence of these opinions, Mr. Soren was advised to lay his case in the form of a petition before his Majesty in Council, A petition was accordingly prepared<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Appendix, No. 8.</NOTE>, and sent to Lord Grenville, inclosed in a letter from Mr. King<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Appendix, No. 9.</NOTE>, the American Minister: his Lordship laid it before the Privy Council, who considered the case as a case of peculiar hard∣ship, and that Mr. Soren was well entitled to some compen∣sation for his loss; but they were of opinion that the applica∣tion ought to have been made to the Lords of the Treasury. This being communicated to Mr. Soren, he prepared another petition to the same effect, and, through the medium of Mr. King, procured it to be laid before the latter Board: he was constant in his attendance every Board-day for six months; at the expiration of which time, the case was referred by the Lords of the Treasury to the Commissioners of the Transport-Office, who made a most extraordinary report to Charles Long, Esq. of the Treasury:
<Q>That the ship called the <HI>Isa∣bella</HI> was not a <HI>regular</HI> transport in the service of Govern∣ment, but only <HI>freighted</HI> by them to carry troops to Bar∣badoes; and that, therefore, their department, or their agents, were not responsible, but the master of the <HI>Isabella</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Lord Grenville's letter to Mr. King, Appendix, No. 10.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>It is difficult to comprehend how the distinction between "a <HI>regular</HI> transport in the <HI>service</HI> of Government," and
"a ship only <HI>freighted</HI> by them to carry troops,"
could affect the claim of Mr. Soren, or of the master or the owner of the <HI>En∣terprise,</HI> on the <HI>justice</HI> of Government for a compensation for the loss they had sustained by means of the iniquitous con∣duct of a man certainly in the <HI>service</HI> of Government; or the right of the <HI>owner</HI> of the <HI>Enterprise,</HI> to the proportion of <HI>freight,</HI> at <HI>least,</HI> for the conveyance of the troops from Tene∣riffe to Barbadoes.</P>
<P>It has been mentioned, that Mr. King inclosed Mr. Soren's
<PB N="15" REF="038531_0014_101250AED34D6030"/>
petition in a note to Lord Grenville: His Lordship transmit∣ed it to Sir William Scott, who returned an answer to his Lordship, in which he stated, "that he was no further ac∣qainted with the merits of the case than as they had appeared to him in a statement of the circumstances which had been submitted to him on the part of the American owners for his opinion, and in the papers then transmitted to him by his Lordship;" and concluded by observing, "that if the course of law had applied an adequate remedy for injuries, and the parties entitled to it had, for some reason or other, <HI>declined</HI> to resort to it, it could not found any claim upon the justice of that Government under which an injury of that species had been committed without being followed by its proper satisfac∣tion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Sir W. Scott's Letter to Lord Grenville, Appendix, No. 11.</NOTE>"</P>
<P>Mr. Soren learned that Messrs. Tarleton and Backhouse, the owners of the <HI>Isabella,</HI> had applied to the Transport Board for an indemnification for the loss of the ships in the service of Government, and that, in the statement of the loss sustain∣ed by them, they had charged 750l. for the conveyance of the troops from Teneriffe to the West Indies in the <HI>Enterprise.</HI> As he had in fact received no remuneration from Messrs. Tarleton and Backhouse, or any other person, for that con∣veyance, he laid his case with this additional circumstance be∣fore Dr. Nicholl, now the King's Advocate in Dolor's Com∣mons, who gave an opinion, of which the following is a copy:</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="opinion">
<P>This vessel having been seized as prize, and proceeded against as such in a regular Court of Vice-Admiralty, any demand for costs and damages, arising out of that seizure, could only be set up under those proceedings; and a sen∣tence of restitution having taken place, unaccompanied by a decree of costs and damages, and that sentence not hav∣ing been appealed from, I am of opinion that the parties are precluded from setting up any demand of costs and da∣mages, either in a Court of Admiralty, or by any other judicial proceeding.</P>

<P>In the month of September 1798, Mr. Soren was ad∣vised to make another application to Lord Grenville indivi∣dually, requesting his Lordship's interposition in his favour: this he did in a letter <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Mr. Soren's letter to Lord Grenville, Appendix, No. 12.</NOTE> which he procured to be delivered to his Lordship through the medium of Mr. King. What step was taken by his Lordship in consequence of this applica∣tion, he could not learn, till after an attendance of several months on his Lordship's Secretary, Mr. Hammond, by whom he was at last informed, that his Lordship had written on the subject to the Right Hon. Henry Dundas, who was then in the country, and for whose return Mr. Soren was under the necessity of waiting till the month of March 1799.</P>
<P>In the month of October 1798, Mr. Soren being informed that Messrs. Tarleton and Backhouse were men of great pro∣perty, was advised to go down to Liverpool, and make personal application to them for some relief; and, having, as before stated, been informed that they had received from Govern∣ment the freight of the troops to Barbadoes, to ascertain whe∣ther he could, by any means, or in any shape, proceed against them in case of their refusal.</P>
<P>Soon after his arrival at Liverpool, he had an interview with Mr. Backhouse, who seemed to pity his case, and dis∣posed to do something for him: he reprobated the conduct of Potter in merited terms, and said "he wished he had hold of him for Mr. Soren's sake;" but at the same time he inform∣ed him that Mr. Tarleton was out of town, and that nothing could be done without his presence and consent.</P>
<P>Mr. John Tarleton arrived, and Mr. Soren waited on
<PB N="17" REF="038531_0016_101250B365087FD0"/>
him; but what was his surprise when he found that Mr. Tarleton attempted to justify the conduct of Potter; said he was perfectly right, and insisted that Mr. Soren was loaded with enemies' property!</P>
<P>In what terms can the conduct of that man be adequately reprehended, who could justify a miscreant who had committed a piracy which disgraces humanity?—Mr. Soren pities Mr. John Tarleton, and would not exchange situations with him, were his fortune ten times what it is; and, with this obser∣vation, let Mr. John Tarleton be dismissed.</P>
<P>In consequence of the suggestions of some professional men at Liverpool, Mr. Soren entertained some hope, that all legal redress against Messrs. Tarleton and Backhouse was not abso∣lutely shut against him: he therefore laid his case, with some additional circumstances and observations, before Mr. Park, who considered it as a case of much compassion; but his opi∣nion was equally unfavourable to Mr. Soren's claim to <HI>legal</HI> redress with those which had preceded it.</P>
<P>Mr. Park's opinion was in the following words:</P>
<Q><TEXT>
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="opinion">
<P>I have perused all the papers laid before me with consi∣derable attention; and although I think it a case of unpa∣ralleled hardship, and infamous misconduct, yet I am sorry to say, that as these proceedings have taken place <HI>under colour of prize,</HI> and as a Court of Admiralty has already taken cognizance of, and come to an adjudication upon, the principal matter, I am of opinion the misconduct of the Captain, either by an action against him or his owners, is not now triable in Great Britain in a Court of <HI>municipal law.</HI> I am aware that Mr. Soren was not personally pre∣sent, to lay his claim before the Vice-Admiralty Court of Barbadoes: but I think that makes no difference; for, in contemplation of the law of England, the sentence of a Court of Admiralty binds every man; and the Captain, though not specially so constituted, was the agent of all parties as to this purpose.</P>
<P>I have also attentively read the case of Le Caux <HI>v.</HI> Eden, referred to in the opinion given by Mr. Gibbs; and I am clearly of opinion, that although the circumstances of that case are very different from, and not to be compared in
<PB N="18" REF="038531_0017_101250B75F9FBFB8"/>
enormity with, those of the present, the principle of that de∣cision, and of others therein cited, applies most strongly to the present. The general principle there established, as well as in Rous <HI>v.</HI> Hassard, and in Livingston <HI>v.</HI> Welch, is, that although an action of trespass would lie for <HI>taking a ship or goods,</HI> or imprisoning, or otherwise cruelly treating a man on the <HI>high seas</HI>; yet, when it is taken as prize, though taken wrongfully, though it be restored, though there be no colour for the taking (as here), the Judge of the Ad∣miralty must judge of all the aggravation and consequences, as well as of the principal matter; and if an action were brought in a Court of common law in England, the plain∣tiff could not recover.</P>
<P>What redress Mr. Soren can obtain in a Court of Ad∣miralty in the present stage of the business, he has already been informed by men very competent to advise him; and I fear he can have no other remedy than by an application to the favour of the British Government, whose subject has behaved in a most oppressive, wicked, and inhuman manner.</P>

<P>My Lord Grenville had, soon after the receipt of Mr. Soren's letter, transmitted it to Sir William Scott, in a note, desiring him to report the circumstances of the case, and the grounds on which legal redress was rendered impossible.</P>
<P>Sir William returned the following answer:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I am honoured with your Lordship's letter, dated Sep∣tember 21, inclosing the copy of a letter received from Mr. Soren, and desiring me to report to your Lordship the cir∣cumstances of the case, and the grounds on which legal re∣dress is rendered impossible. In obedience to your Lord∣ship's request, I have considered the same; and report to your Lordship, that the ship <HI>Enterprise,</HI> belonging to Mr. Soren, an American subject, was taken and carried into Barbadoes by the British letter of marque ship <HI>Isabella,</HI> in a
<PB N="19" REF="038531_0018_101250B8FA326060"/>
manner, as Mr. Soren has uniformly represented it, very inconsistent with justice and good faith. That proceedings were commenced in the Vice-Admiralty Court of that island, by the decree of which the vessel was finally liber∣ated; but, that no costs and damages were awarded—none having been proved on the part of the owner. That all avenue to legal redress is irrevocably closed, by this omission on the part of the owner, or his agent; for, that a simple restitution having been accepted in the Court below, the proceedings there were completely finished, and cannot be revived by a new demand for costs and damages, which had never been urged in the original cause: and, for the same reason, no such demand can be addressed to the Court of Appeals; the sentence having been accepted by the owner or his agent in an unqualified manner, and without any ul∣terior demand, from the rejection of which he might legally have appealed. And as to a Court of common law, to which he was advised to resort, it is sufficient to observe, that that Court has no jurisdiction upon subjects of this na∣ture; but that the matter of prize, with all its conse∣quences, as well of costs and damages, as of every other spe∣cies, belongs, altogether and exclusively, to the Courts of Admiralty.</P>
<P>Your Lordship will, therefore, be pleased to observe, that the hardship of this case, whatever may be its extent, arises entirely from the neglect of the owner or his agent; which Mr. Soren justifies or excuses, by imputing it to ill advice administered in the island. One certain hardship I have already pointed out to be the entire loss of legal redress; and with respect to redress of an equitable nature, it is not perhaps too harsh to remark, that if a country provides Courts of Justice and a regular course of legal proceedings for the reparation of wrongs done by its subjects to the sub∣jects of foreign powers, it has done all that the intercourse of nations requires; and that the dereliction of such legal remedies, under the plea of private ill advice which the par∣ties have received to that effect, has not been held, as far as I know, to found a demand upon the equity of the public Government of the country. It is, however, due to the
<PB N="20" REF="038531_0019_101250BB62CF9348"/>
claimant to remark, that he has, in his present application, stated a public service of considerable merit towards the King's Government, in the conveyance of His Majesty's forces, on board his vessel, to the island of Barbadoes, when the <HI>Isabella</HI> transport was incapable of conveying them; and I submit to your Lordship's judgment, how far the proof of such a fact, aided by such circumstances of the case as address themselves to compassion, may entitle the party to be favourably considered by his Majesty's Government.</P>

<P>On the 12th of March Mr. Dundas sent a letter to the Commissioners of the Transport Board, of which the follow∣ing is a copy:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Downing-street,</HI>
<DATE><HI>March</HI> 12, 1799.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The case of Mr. Soren, freighter of the American ship <HI>Enterprise,</HI> with which you are already fully acquainted, and to which the inclosed papers relate, is so singularly hard, and so peculiarly entitled to relief, that I have re∣ceived his Majesty's commands to desire that you will cause to be paid to him, as owner of the ship <HI>Enterprise, the same allowance of freight and passage-money for every British officer and soldier received by him from on board the</HI> Isabella, <HI>and landed at Barbadoes, as he would have been entitled to, had he received them on board in England, and conveyed them to that island in safety,</HI> upon his producing sufficient certificates of the service having been performed in the manner he has
<PB N="21" REF="038531_0020_101250BEDDB0C8C8"/>
stated: this allowance to be made according to the rate of the contract made with the owners of the <HI>Isabella</HI>: and I hope, for every reason, that this affair may be concluded with as little delay as possible.</P>
<P>At the same time I cannot avoid suggesting the pro∣priety of your endeavouring to ascertain how far it may be possible to recover, from the owners of the <HI>Isabella,</HI> the amount, or any part, of what has been paid to them for this service, which they certainly did not duly perform</P>

<POSTSCRIPT>
<P>Commissioners of Transports.</P>
</POSTSCRIPT></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>In consequence of information received by Mr. Soren, that my Lord Grenville, as well as Mr. Dundas, were favourably disposed to him, and had actually interfered on his behalf and that a correspondence had been held by letter on the sub∣ject, with others of his Majesty's Ministers, he was advised to endeavour to obtain copies of such correspondence; and ac∣cordingly he made application at the Transport-Office, from which, on the 7th of April last, he obtained, among others, copies of the above three letters.</P>
<P>What report the Commissioners of the Transport-office made in consequence of Mr. Dundas's recommendation of the case to their consideration, Mr. Soren has not learned; but he was informed at that office, that it was the opinion of some persons there that the Lords of the Treasury ought to cause to be paid to him, the amount of the loss sustained on his cargo, as well as the freight for the conveyance of the troops. He renewed his attendance at the Treasury, and continued it every Board-day till the month of July following, when he was informed by Mr. Long, that the Lords of the Treasury had directed the Transport-office to pay him 500l. This ra∣ther surprised him, as Messrs. Tarleton and Backhouse had paid for the conveyance of about 60 of the troops in the <HI>Te∣neriffe Packet</HI> the sum of 1500l. and at that rate the convey∣ance of the remaining 150 in the <HI>Enterprize</HI> would amount to 3750l. Mr. Soren, therefore, took the liberty of remon∣strating
<PB N="22" REF="038531_0021_101250C07B751990"/>
with Mr. Long on the smallness of the sum, when that gentleman assured him that was the whole that was or∣dered him, and intimated, that unless he accepted the sum then offered, he had to expect nothing. The difficulties in which Mr. Soren had been involved, from the total ruin of his fortune, and the disappointment of the very flattering pro∣spects he had reasonably formed from the event of his voy∣age, the distress he had suffered from the great length of time which had clapsed from the period when his ship was seized, and the dread that Mr. Long's intimation might be realized, induced him to accept the proffered sum; and it seems he has but small foundation to hope for any further compensation for his loss, and the injury he has sustained, unless the preceding simple narrative of his case should happen to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the eye of those members of Administration who appear to have formed a just estimation of the gross injustice of the capture, and the unparalleled circumstances of wickedness and oppression with which it was accompanied.</P>
<P>The objection to Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> claim of compensation is, that he has let pass the proper time for making that claim.— It is certainly true that a Court of Admiralty has the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the question, "<HI>Prize or no prize?</HI>" and that, having cognizance of the <HI>principal</HI> question, it has also the power, and the <HI>exclusive</HI> power, of awarding costs and damages to the full extent, to the captured, where the cir∣cumstances of the case warrant such a decree. It must be ad∣mitted, that a decree of restitution by no means implies that the captured are entitled, as a matter of course, to a decree of costs and damages: there may have been <HI>probable</HI> grounds of seizure, though, on a full investigation, the ship and cargo seized may be justly restored. It must also be admitted, that where the parties libelled, omit, in the proper stage of the pro∣ceedings, to pray for costs and damages, the fair inference, in the first instance is, that they are satisfied their case does not entitle them to demand them: and it cannot be denied, that, in a legal point of view, Mr. St. Barbe was Mr. Soren's agent, though not specially constituted such; and that Mr. Soren was, in the same point of view, bound by his acts or omissions; but neither can it be denied, that a man may
<PB N="23" REF="038531_0022_101250C21BBB9FE8"/>
suffer great injustice, and sustain most grievous hardships, from the default of his agent, without being justly charged with the consciousness of the want of merit in his cause, and that he may, by accident or misfortune, or by the artful ma∣nagement of his opponent, be completely shut out from <HI>legal</HI> redress, without forfeiting his claim to compensation from that Government, by the nefarious acts of whose <HI>servant</HI> he has been reduced to ruin.</P>
<P>This is <HI>peculiarly</HI> the case of Mr. Soren: he exercised an act of the most benevolent nature towards a ship in distress, in the danger of every moment going to the bottom of the ocean; this ship, and its commander, were in the <HI>service</HI> of the Government of Great Britain: he received a most un∣grateful requital; his ship and cargo were seized as prize, without the most distant shadow of a cause; he was cruelly put in a situation which prevented him, but under the most mortifying circumstances, from following his property to the place where he might in person have claimed the protection and justice of the proper jurisdiction. There does not even seem to have been any censurable default in his agent. Mr. St. Barbe did, in fact, in the proper stage of the proceeding, petition for costs and damages; this was rendered nugatory by the management of Potter, who procured the ship and cargo to be libelled as a droit of Admiralty at the suit of the King's advocate, on the very day when his petition was to be taken into consideration. Before the second libel could be disposed of, Potter, against whom alone the decree of costs and damages could be pronounced, absconded, leaving no pro∣perty against which such a decree could attach: the King's Advocate pays no costs or damages: in the present case he acted merely in an official capacity, on the suggestion of Pot∣ter: it is therefore to be attributed to accident, or at the most an excusable want of foresight on the part of Mr. St Barbe or his advisers, or to the guilty management of Potter, that the proper time for demanding legal redress has passed.</P>
<P>Had the <HI>Enterprise</HI> been captured by a person armed with a mere letter of marque, or even by a King's ship in the or∣dinary course of warfare on the seas, without the circumstance of her having fallen into the snare by an act of benevolence
<PB N="24" REF="038531_0023_101250C497643860"/>
on the part of her commander and supercargo; though there had been no <HI>colour</HI> for the capture, though there had been no circumstance of suspicion to <HI>justify</HI> the capture, though there had been a decree of restitution on the fullest and clearest evi∣dence that she was not a fit subject of seizure, though it must have been manifest to all the world, that if a petition for costs and damages had been preferred, it must have been decreed; yet if the parties interested had, in the proper stage of the pro∣ceedings, through ignorance, or accident, or ill advice, or any other cause, omitted to claim those costs and damages, it is not contended that there would have been any moral obligation on the Government, under the sanction of whose flag the injury had been committed, to refund the injured party the loss he had sustained.</P>
<P>In the present case, it is not contended that Government were bound, by any rule of strict moral obligation, to com∣pensate Mr. Soren for any disappointment in his expectation of <HI>speculative</HI> gain on the event of his voyage; but, on an at∣tentive perusal of his case, it is hardly to be supposed that the impartial reader will think it unreasonable or too sanguine in him to have hoped that he would have been reimbursed the difference between the prime cost of his cargo and the produce of the remains which escaped the hands of his plundering captor, together with the full freight for the troops conveyed in his ship from Teneriffe to Barbadoes. His right to the <HI>latter</HI> can hardly be disputed on strict <HI>legal</HI> principles; though, perhaps, he might not be able, in any form of action, to re∣cover against the Commissioners of Transports, because he had no contract with them. This right must indeed be con∣sidered as acknowledged by those who ordered the payment of the 500<HI>l.</HI>; for it seems to have been ordered, not as an of∣fering of generosity in compassion to the hardships of his case, but as an equivalent for the freight of the troops: it was, in fact, by no means an equivalent according to the usual rate in such cases. By what hidden influence so small a sum was ordered, it is difficult to conjecture: it is manifest, from the letters of Lord Grenville and Mr. Dundas, that it was the wish of both those ministers that Mr. Soren should have an ample compensation.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="038531_0024_101250C70760F250"/>The contrast between Mr. Soren's present situation, and what it might have been, had he been fortunate enough not to have fallen in with the <HI>Isabella,</HI> is most distressing. From Hamburgh he failed with a cargo, the prime cost of which ex∣ceeded 3000<HI>l.</HI>: it consisted of articles which would have been of high value in the place to which they were destined; the pro∣fits would have been large; the produce was to have been laid out in the purchase of an article which might probably have been sold at Hamburgh at double the original price; and to this was to be added the profit arising from so much more of the same article as could have been purchased at Su∣rinam for 15,000<HI>l.</HI>; for to that extent Mr. Soren had letters of credit on that place: the whole profits of his voyage must have placed him in a state of enviable independence. He is now stripped of every thing; he has wasted four years of the prime of life in fruitless solicitation; he has again to begin his career of industry, with a wife and three infant children, without the aid of capital, though not perhaps without friends. His case is respectfully submitted to the attentive perusal of the Public, but more particularly of those whose situation in life, or the situation of whose friends and relatives, may pos∣sibly expose them to the same kind of distress which he has experienced.</P>

<HEAD>No. I. Copy of Charter-party.</HEAD>
<P>BY this present charter-party be it known unto whom it may concern, that on Tuesday the 24th day of November, in the year of our Lord 1795, before me, Charles Conrad Frederic Hartman, notary-public by Imperial authority law∣fully admitted and sworn, dwelling and practising in the free imperial city of Hamburgh, personally came and appeared Messrs. Holyoke and Soren, of Boston, but now of this city, merchants, affreighters, of the one part, and Captain Wyatt St. Barbe, master or commander of the American ship or vessel called the Enterprise, of the burden of 170 lasts, or there∣abouts, letter, of the other part; who declared, that by the interposition of Mr. Peter Sprinkhorn, of Hamburgh, sworn ship's-broker, they had covenanted and agreed on the freight∣ing and letting the said vessel for a voyage from hence to Surinam and back to this port, on the terms as follow; that is to say:</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="28" REF="038531_0026_101250CC9E924758"/>1st, Captain Wyatt St. Barbe is obliged to proceed, with∣in thirty days, from hence, either in ballastor with permitted goods, to Surinam, and there to let and deliver his said ship tight and staunch, well caulked, tackled, apparelled, manned, and provided with every thing else necessary for the perform∣ing of the said loading and voyage, as also with the proper ship's papers, to the sole use and free disposition of the freighters, (the proper place for putting in the sails, cables and provisions, as also the necessary room for the crew, ex∣cepted, as being for the ship's use,) he not being permitted to load any goods or merchandizes for whomsoever, without the consent of the freighters, on pain of forfeiting the freight-money agreed upon for such goods, except three tons per hundred, which the captain may have on board for his own account, according to the custom of America.</P>
<P N="2">2d, The freighter's promise to cause to be shipped on board the said vessel, on her safe arrival at Surinam afore∣said, a full convenient cargo of West Indian products; but the captain is allowed three tons per hundred, as he is privi∣leged according to the custom of America; with which cargo the captain, as soon as he shall be dispatched by the shippers, is to depart immediately, wind and weather permitting it, and to proceed on his voyage directly to this port of Ham∣burgh.</P>
<P N="3">3d, On the ship's safe arrival at the unloading place, and the captain having well and faithfully delivered the cargo ac∣cording to the bills of lading by him signed, (save that he shall not be answerable for the risks and damages of the sea,) the freighters are obliged to cause to be paid unto the said captain, or to his order, exactly, and without exception, his freight-money, stipulated at the rate of two thousand six hundred pounds sterling, good and lawful money of Great Britain, with fifteen per cent. primage for the whole ship's hold, and the performance of both voyages. On account of which freight, the captain is to be furnished at Surinam with what money he may be in need of, the extraordinary average which
<PB N="29" REF="038531_0027_101250D0261ECA00"/>
might happen on this intended voyage being to be regulated and paid according to the custom of the sea.</P>
<P N="4">4th, For loading at Surinam, forty running days, and for delivering here, thirty running days, in all, are agreed, be∣ginning at Surinam aforesaid as soon as the captain shall have advertised the shipper of his ship's being ready to receive the cargo on board, and continuing here the day after the said ship's being reported at the Customhouse, and the captain's having informed the consignees of the cargo of his being pre∣pared to deliver the same. If detained longer, the freighters are to pay him six pounds lawful British sterling money de∣murrage, for every day so detained, day by day, as it becomes due.</P>
<P N="5">5th, The freighters cause the cargo to be shipped on board, and so likewise landed, free of any expences to the captain, provided his ship be moored at proper places, so as the depth of the water will permit it; but the captain is obliged to assist with his boats and people in taking in the cargo at Surinam aforesaid.</P>
<P N="6">6th, The Custom-house duties for the cargo shall be cleared by the freighters, and those for the ship by the cap∣tain▪</P>
<P N="7">7th, In case the ship should happen to be lost on her homeward passage, which God forbid, the freighters are bound to pay for the outward voyage to Mr. St. Barbe, or Messrs. Parish and Co. his correspondents here, one thousand two hundred pounds sterling, good and lawful money of Great Britain, with fifteen per cent. primage, after deducting the money which the captain may have received at Surinam as aforesaid.</P>
<P>And for the true performance of all and singular the above covenants and agreements, the said parties do hereby mutually bind themselves, especially the freighters engaging the said
<PB N="30" REF="038531_0028_101250D1F6169A78"/>
cargo, and the said captain, his ship and freight, submitting the same to the laws and practice of the sea, all upon faith and honesty, and without any fraud or collusion: In witness whereof, both parties above named have hereunto set their hands in my registry in Hamburgh, the day and year afore∣said.</P>

<HEAD>No. IV. Letter from <HI>PETER FAVENC,</HI> Consul-General for the Canary Islands, to <HI>CHARLES LONG,</HI> Esq.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The motive of troubling you with this letter is at the re∣quest of Mr. Soren, relative to a transaction that took place in the year 1796. In the month of March, in the said year, arrived in Santa Cruz, in the island of Teneriffe, an English vessel, commanded by a man of the name of Charles Potter; she was from Cork, with troops on board, bound to the island of Barbadoes. On her arrival, through the channel of one of my agents, the said Potter applied to me for my advice and assistance, as his vessel was very leaky, and totally unfit to pro∣ceed on her voyage; indeed, by his own confession, had he not had the good fortune to fall in with the American ship, the Enterprize, bound from Hamburgh to the island of De∣marara, he would, in all probability, never have reached Te∣neriffe, or any other port. Happening at that period to be in the island of Grand Canary, with some friends, I immediate∣ly came over to aid him in the best manner I was able. He stated to me the service Captain St. Barbe and Mr. Soren had rendered him, in bearing down when he hoisted signals of distress; but, waving the gratitude he should have felt for what in all probability was the preservation of his life, and of those entrusted to his care, he proclaimed the American ship a lawful prize, having naval stores on board, and being bound to an enemy's port: Of this I had great doubt, from the documents he produced; and from the event I am justi∣fied. He was pressing with me to condemn her; but this I could not, it not laying solely in my breast—I advised him carrying her down to some island where there was a regular Court of Admiralty established.</P>
<P>His own vessel, the Isabella, having been condemned and sold, it was necessary for him, the said Potter, to devise some plan for the conveying these troops to their destination. As
<PB N="34" REF="038531_0032_101250DB5C7E8E40"/>
many as he could, he put on board the Enterprise; and hav∣ing freighted a brig called the Teneriffe Packet, he in these two vessels conveyed the troops, which all arrived safe, and without the least accident. In regard to Potter's conduct, I think it was totally unjustifiable, with respect to Mr. Soren, Captain St. Barbe, and the proprietors of the goods on board the Enterprise, he having acted towards them with the greatest ingratitude; and not having it in his power to make them the proper retribution, I think, from the service the country has received in these troops being so soon forwarded to Barbadoes, to which place much time would have elapsed before their ar∣rival, had the Enterprise not been seized upon in the very cruel manner she was, some adequate compensation for the loss sustained by the parties interested ought to be made: but this it does not become me to point out; to superior judgment I leave that.</P>
<P>If it would not be inconvenient to you, Sir, or intruding too much on your time, I should feel myself honoured in half an hour's conversation with you on the subject of Messrs. Tarleton and Backhouse, of Liverpool, whose conduct, in some part of this transaction, I think, should be condemned.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>With respect, I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, PETER FAVENC, Consul-General for the Canary Islands.</SIGNED>

<P>Wyatt St. Barbe, a citizen of the United States of Ameri∣ca, and late master of the ship Enterprise, maketh oath and faith, that when the libel preferred by Charles Potter, before the Vice-Admiralty Court of Barbadoes, against his said ship, was dismissed by the said Court, this deponent petitioned the said Court of Vice-Admiralty, for damages; that on the day appointed to investigate the merits of the said petition, the said ship Enterprise was again libelled by Matthew Coulthurst, Esq. the King's Advocate, as a droit of Admiralty, under pretence of the ship and cargo being Dutch property; that af∣ter hearing counsel, and finding that the said ship and cargo were wholly the property of American citizens, and that the commission of the said Charles Potter extended only to the capture of French property, the Judge of the said Court of Vice-Admiralty ordered the ship, and what remained unplun∣dered of the cargo, to be restored to this deponent. And this deponent further saith, that his counsel, Messrs. Robert Wim∣berley, jun. and Edward Applethwaite, and his proctor, Mr. Thomas Went, all concurred in advising him not to petition
<PB N="38" REF="038531_0036_101250E3B223B950"/>
again for damages, as the said Charles Potter had run away from the said island, leaving no effects behind him, and as the King's Advocate pays no damages: and the said counsel and proctor further advised this deponent to go away with his said ship Enterprise, and appeal to the High Court of Admi∣ralty in England for redress.</P>

<HEAD>No. VIII. PETITION TO HIS MAJESTY.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To the <HI>KING'S</HI> Most Excellent Majesty in Council, The Humble Petition of <HI>JOHN SOREN,</HI> of Boston, in North America, merchant, partner in the house of Holyoke and So∣ren, of Boston aforesaid, and <HI>WYATT ST. BARBE,</HI> captain of the American ship Enterprise, belonging to Clough, of Witchcasset, Massachusets, in North America aforesaid, SHEWETH,</OPENER>
<P>That your petitioners entered into a charter-party, or agree∣ment together, bearing date at Hamburgh the 24th of No∣vember 1795, whereby it was agreed that your Petitioner, Captain Wyatt St. Barbe, should proceed from Hamburgh aforesaid, with the said ship, either in ballast or permitted goods, to Surinam; and your Petitioner, John Soren, agreed to ship on board the said vessel, at Surinam aforesaid, a full cargo of West India products, on the terms therein men∣tioned.</P>
<P>That your Petitioner, John Soren, shipped a cargo on the said vessel, consisting of linen, cheese, bacon, and other goods, which he purchased at Hamburgh, for the sum of 3204<HI>l.</HI> 3<HI>s.</HI> 4<HI>d.</HI> of sterling money of Great Britain; and your petiti∣oner, Wyatt St. Barbe, also shipped a quantity of linen, gro∣ceries, liquors, and glass, on account of himself and Messrs. Furst and Co. citizens and burghers of Hamburgh, to the value of 901<HI>l.</HI> 8<HI>s.</HI> 11<HI>d.</HI> of like sterling money.</P>
<P>That your Petitioners set sail in the said ship, on the 5th day of February 1796, from Hamburgh, to Surinam, there to dispose of their said cargo; and your Petitioner, John So∣ren, also intended to take in another cargo of coffee at Suri∣nam, upon his own account.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="038531_0038_101250E88AEDDA00"/>That your Petitioners, on the 25th day of February 1796, the said ship Enterprise being in latitude 44° 1′ N. and lon∣gitude 18° 35′ W. on her said voyage, discovered a ship with an English ensign reversed, hoisted as a signal of dis∣tress: Your Petitioners, therefore, immediately made sail for her, and came up with and spoke her, and found her to be a British vessel, called the Isabella letter of marque, belonging to Messrs. Tarleton and Backhouse, of the port of Liverpool commanded by Captain Charles Potter, and chartered as a transport-ship by the British Government, and was then on a voyage from Cork to the island of Barbadoes, with a consider∣able number of your Majesty's troops on board. Your Peti∣tioners found her in a very leaky and disabled condition, and in great distress and danger, and both pumps going incessantly. Captain Potter, of the Isabella, came on board your Petition∣er's vessel, and, after representing to your Petitioner, Captain St. Barbe, the extreme perilous situation of his ship and com∣pany, entreated your said Petitioner to accompany him, and see him safe into Lisbon or Corunna; in answer to which, your Petitioner, Captain St. Barbe, observed, that having freighted his own ship, the Enterprise, for Surinam, his going with her to Lisbon or Corunna would be so great a deviation from his own voyage, that it would be thereby destroyed; but that, on account of the very distressed situation of the Isabella and her crew, he would accompany them to Madeira, Te∣neriffe, or any of the Windward Islands, and would accom∣modate the officers and as many of your Majesty's troops as he could in his own vessel, and would also render every other assistance in his power. To all which your Petitioner John Soren also most readily gave his consent.</P>
<P>That Captain Potter appeared to your Petitioners to be very well pleased and satisfied with the humane offer of your Petitioners, and said he would immediately send on board his own vessel for the approbation of the colonel and other offi∣cers of your Majesty's troops. He accordingly sent his own mate, who had come on board your Petitioner's ship along with him, to his own vessel, in order to communicate, as your
<PB N="41" REF="038531_0039_101250EAF23CD318"/>
Petitioners understood, the very obliging offer made by your Petitioners, as before-mentioned: but, instead of this, with an ingratitude and treachery scarcely to be paralleled, he desired his mate to bring along with him a party of the ship Isabella's armed force, for the purpose of capturing your Petitioner's said ship, the Enterprise, notwithstanding she belonged to, and was freighted and commanded by, the citizens of the United States of America, a country at peace with your Majesty, had nothing but neutral goods on board, purchased at Hamburgh for sale at Surinam aforesaid, notwithstanding the offers made by your Petitioners to Captain Potter, to see the Isabella and her company safe at Madeira or Teneriffe, or any of the Windward Islands, as aforesaid, and notwithstanding your Petitioners had sailed a considerable way out of their own track for the purpose of saving the said ship Isabella from being lost, which in all probability would have happened but for the timely interference of your Petitioners.</P>
<P>That the said mate returned with a party of armed soldiers and sailors from the Isabella, and seized your Petitioner's said ship and cargo as a prize, and made your Petitioners and the crew prisoners, and forced your Petitioner, John Soren, with the chief mate and crew, out of their own ship into a boat, and put them on board the Isabella, though she was still in the most dangerous and distressed condition, as if for the very purpose of sacrificing them to that fate from which your Petitioners had saved them.</P>
<P>That when your Petitioner John Soren arrived on board the Isabella, he stated the circumstances to the officers of your Majesty's troops on board, and they reprobated, in the strong∣est terms, the shocking and inhumane conduct of Captain Potter.</P>
<P>That Captain Potter obliged your Petitioner Captain St. Barbe to give him up all his papers, and broke open several cases and boxes, and took thereout part of the cargo, what∣ever he thought proper.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="038531_0040_101250ECA5FE5568"/>That Captain Potter proceeded with both vessels to St. Croix, Teneriffe, and then transhipt military stores and bag∣gage from the Isabella (she being entirely unfit for sea service, and accordingly condemned) to your Petitioner's ship, the Enterprise, and broke open some other packages, and started others, for the purpose of fitting up births for the accommo∣dation of the soldiers, who, to the number of 150, with wo∣men and children, besides the Isabella's crew, were embarked on board the Enterprise.</P>
<P>That during their stay at Teneriffe, your Petitioner, John Soren, frequently requested Captain Potter permission to go on shore, that he might apply to the British Consul there for an investigation of Captain Potter's proceedings, which Captain Potter refused; and your Petitioner, John Soren, was detained a prisoner on board the Isabella, until he was liberated by order of the Governor of the island—but he was not then permitted to carry on shore any of his private property.</P>
<P>That Captain Potter sailed from Teneriffe with your Pe∣titioners' said ship, the Enterprise, and your Petitioner, Cap∣tain St. Barbe, on board her, but leaving your Petitioner, John Soren, at Teneriffe; and your Petitioners' said vessel arrived in Carlisle-bay, Barbadoes, on the 16th day of April 1796.</P>
<P>That during the voyage of the said ship from Teneriffe to Barbadoes, Captain Potter endeavoured to seduce and corrupt the sailors of the Enterprise, by giving them liquors, making them great promises, and otherwise, to induce them to swear that the ship and cargo were French and Dutch property; but finding such attempts ineffectual, he put them upon a very scanty allowance of bread and water, by which the health of the seamen was greatly injured, particularly of the carpenter, who was likewise kept in chains.</P>
<P>That upon the arrival of the ship Enterprise at Barbadoes, Captain Potter instituted a libel against her and the cargo, as
<PB N="43" REF="038531_0041_101250F0F5527F58"/>
a prize, in the Court of Vice-Admiralty in Barbadoes; to which a claim was entered by your Petitioner, Captain St. Barbe, on behalf of himself and the owners of the said ship and cargo; and an order was made, on the application of your said Petitioner, that Captain Potter should give security for costs, in case the said ship should not be condemned:— Potter did not give security as ordered, but absconded; and the libel was dismissed.</P>
<P>That, very soon afterwards, a libel was filed by the Ad∣vocate-General against the ship and cargo, as a droit of Admi∣ralty; to which a claim was also put in by your Petitioner, Captain St. Barbe, on behalf of the ship's owners and the persons interested in her cargo; and proceedings being had and examinations taken in the said cause, the same was, on the 8th of September 1796, heard before the Hon. Jonathan Blenman, sole Judge of the said Court; and upon such hear∣ing, the said libel was dismissed, and the ship and cargo or∣dered and adjudged to be restored to your Petitioner, Cap∣tain St. Barbe, as the claimant of the same.</P>
<P>That your Petitioner, Captain St. Barbe, on the said ship being delivered up to him, and such part of the cargo as had not been taken out of the said vessel, during the time she re∣mained in possession of the said Captain Potter, sold and dis∣posed of such remaining cargo, by auction, for the net sum of 1756<HI>l.</HI> 9<HI>s.</HI> 9¾<HI>d.</HI>; which occasions a loss to your Petitioners of the sum of 2349<HI>l.</HI> 12<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> sterling, upon the cost price of the articles purchased at Hamburgh.</P>
<P>That your Petitioners have annexed hereunto an account of the actual loss sustained by themselves and the other owners of the said ship and her cargo.</P>
<P>That the owners of the Enterprise and her cargo, but for the detention aforesaid, would have gained a considerable profit upon the sale of the cargo at Surinam; and your Petitioner, John Soren, had likewise engaged, by the charter-party, to freight the said vessel with coffee, at Surinam, to the amount,
<PB N="44" REF="038531_0042_101250F29DAAECC8"/>
in weight, of 600,000<HI>lb.</HI>; upon which, with other coffee he had intended to ship for Europe, a considerable profit would have arisen.</P>
<P>That the said vessel, during the time she was in the hands of the said Captain Potter, was robbed of great part of her tackling and apparel, and the worms had eat her bottom, and she was otherwise so much damaged, that your Petitioner ne∣cessarily expended large sums in repairing her.</P>
<P>That your Petitioners did not apply to the Vice-Admiralty Court of Barbadoes for the payment of their said damages and costs, because, before the dismissal of the second libel insti∣tuted by your Majesty's Advocate-General against the said ship and cargo, Captain Potter had actually absconded from the island of Barbadoes, and no damages or costs, as your Pe∣titioners are informed, are paid in prosecuting in your Ma∣jesty's name.</P>
<P>That your Petitioners, since their arrival in England, have been advised by Sir William Scott and Mr. Gibbs, one of your Majesty's counsel, that your Petitioners cannot obtain any redress or compensation in any of the courts of law in this Kingdom, for the damages and costs which they have sustained by the premises, either from Messrs. Tarleton and Backhouse, the owners of Captain Potter's vessel, or from the said Captain Potter, who hath absconded.</P>
<P>Your Petitioners, therefore, most humbly pray Your Ma∣jesty will be graciously pleased to take the aforesaid matters and things into your royal consideration, and grant to your Petitioners such relief as Your Majesty in the exercise of your royal wisdom and bounty shall think fit and expedient.</P>

<P>Lord Grenville's compliments to Mr. King, and has the honour of transmitting him an extract of a letter from the Transport Board to Mr. Long, on the subject of the memo∣rial of Messrs. Soren and St. Barbe.</P>
<P>"Having considered the papers referred to us by the Lords Commissioners of his Majesty's Treasury, and contained in your letter to us of the▪ 8th inst. relative to the complaint of John Soren, of Boston, in North America, and Wyatt St. Barbe, captain of the ship Enterprise, against Charles Potter, master of the Isabella of Liverpool, employed in the service of Government, who is stated to have taken forcible pos∣session of the said ship Enterprise, to the great loss of the owners; we humbly beg leave to report to their Lordships, that the said ship Isabella was not a regular transport in his

Majesty's service, but engaged to take upon <HI>freight only,</HI> in the month of September 1795, a certain number of troops from Cork to the West Indies; that, under the circum∣stances of this ship engaged only upon freight, and therefore acting by no means under the direction of this Board, further than the perfecting her engagement of conveying troops from Cork to the West Indies, the capture of the Enterprise be∣came the act and deed of the master of the Isabella, for which he stands responsible, and not this department or its agents."</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I am honoured with your Lordship's letter, dated De∣cember 29th, inclosing a copy of a note received from Mr. King, together with its inclosure, relative to the ship En∣terprise, and requesting me to report to your Lordship my opinion on the merits of the case, as far as I might be in∣formed thereupon. In obedience to your Lordship's request, I have considered the same, and report to your Lordship, that I am no further acquainted with the merits of the case, than as they have appeared to me in a statement of the cir∣cumstances which was submitted to me on the part of the American owners for my opinion, and in the papers now transmitted to me by your Lordship—That, according to the representations contained therein, the American owners have sustained a very considerable loss, in consequence of the mis∣conduct of the privateer; but that the law had offered a re∣medy for the injury, by giving them a demand for costs and damages against Captain Potter, or, in case of his insolvency, against his securities, and against his owners, who were all answerable to the extent of the damages that might have been awarded against him—That this demand ought to have been made in the Vice-Admiralty Court, and was not in the least degree precluded by the subsequent proceedings carried
<PB N="47" REF="038531_0045_101250FB0D4BD6D0"/>
on in his Majesty's name against this ship and her cargo— That the American owners made no such demand, and must therefore, in all <HI>legal</HI> consideration, be presumed to have ac∣quiesced in the justice of a simple restitution, without costs and damages; and, by that acquiescence they stand barred from the possibility of obtaining a <HI>legal</HI> relief, either in Courts of Admiralty or in courts of any other species. What other re∣lief they are desirous of obtaining in consequence of their present application, they do not define in the prayer of their petition: but I must submit generally, that if the course of law has applied an adequate remedy for injuries, and the par∣ties entitled to it have for some reason or other declined to resort to it, it cannot found any claim upon the justice of that government under which an injury of that species has been committed without being followed by its proper satisfaction.</P>

<HEAD>No. XII. Letter from Mr. Soren to Lord Grenville.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>My disagreeable situation in this country, arising from the circumstance of having administered to the relief of the Bri∣tish ship Isabella letter of marque, commanded by Captain Charles Potter, obliges me to apply to your Lordship for that redress and assistance the forms of law here deny me.</P>
<P>I beg leave to bring to your Lordship's recollection an application made on my behalf as freighter of the American ship Enterprise, Captain Wyatt St. Barbe, by Mr. King, the American minister, to your Lordship. The answers I have had the honour to receive, have been wholly against any <HI>legal</HI> claim upon my part, by reason of non-application
<PB N="48" REF="038531_0046_101250FCA91C5E48"/>
for damages, upon the acquittal of the Enterprise, libelled by Captain Potter in the Vice-Admiralty Court at Barbadoes as a prize. The reasons the Captain of the Enterprise assigns for such non-application for damages are, that his counsel at Barbadoes advised him to apply for damages in England, be∣cause Potter had absented himself from the island, and there was not any person within the jurisdiction of the Admiralty Court against whom damages could be awarded, and as the owners of the Isabella, Messrs Tarleton and Backhouse, re∣sided at Liverpool, in England.</P>
<P>I have procured the several opinions of Sir William Scott, Dr. Nicholls, and Mr. Gibbs, one of his Majesty's counsel, who inform me no redress can be had by application either in the Admiralty or common law courts here. It falls, my Lord, hard indeed upon me. I shall, unless I have a claim upon the humanity and accustomed generosity of the British Government, be utterly ruined—hard, my Lord, because I had no opportunity hitherto of making any effectual application for redress. Having been left by Captain Potter at the island of Teneriffe, and wholly unable to proceed to Barbadoes, to prosecute my case in the Admiralty Court there in person, I proceeded to England, (all my property withheld from me, and consequently with much inconve∣nience), to lay my case before the British Government. I have been in this country upwards of two years, solely upon this business; and I assure your Lordship, from the circum∣stance of being, by such capture, stripped of the greatest part of my property, that I have, during my residence here, un∣dergone much personal inconvenience.</P>
<P>The Isabella had on board near 300 troops for the West Indies. Humanity, my Lord, induced me to relieve the ship, and by the assistance I rendered, the majority of those persons were conveyed in the Enterprise to the places of their destination. This, my Lord, Captain Potter would not deny, was he in this country. Some recompense I submit, should be made, for forcing me out of my ship at the point
<PB N="49" REF="038531_0047_1012299CCC0DF7D0"/>
of the bayonet, after having offered, to render any assistance in my power to Captain Potter; for sending me on board the Isabella in the miserable condition she was; but certainly, my Lord, for forcibly taking possession of a neutral ship, and expending my property. I only ask similar humanity to be shewn towards me, for my preservation, as I extended to the persons on board the Isabella; for I am at this mo∣ment without the prospect of placing myself in a situation to enable me to provide for my support. The British Govern∣ment has in fact had the use of the Enterprise to forward the troops: I submit, my Lord, whether some compensation ought not to be awarded for my assistance in that respect. My voyage to Surinam for coffee is entirely lost, and I have been unable to fulfil my mercantile engagements—Unable to pro∣ceed to Barbadoes, I did, as I thought, and still think, all in my power to seek redress, by sailing for England to make application there. No one, my Lord, upon examination of my case, can doubt the hardship of it; and the only ar∣gument to be alleged against my application is, that Captain St. Barbe (being advised by his counsel at Barbadoes) did not petition for damages there upon the acquittal of the ship, at which place I am now even shut out from applying for redress; nor was there a possibility of ever applying on my part. How hard your Lordship sees these circumstances are upon me. I humbly conceive the British Government has, in many cases, assisted persons who do not stand in a situation to make legal demands, but whose claims are equitable and com∣passionate. Such, my Lord, I apprehend is my case: and as I have hitherto had no opportunity of prosecuting my case in person, I have to request such assistance and redress, through your Lordship's means, as from the circumstance of having relieved a British ship in distress, with his Majesty's troops on board, which has brought me into my present con∣dition, the equity of my case, and my distressed situation, demand.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Soon after the receipt of your late letter, recapitulating the oppressive circumstances of the capture of your vessel and cargo, I sent it enclosed in a note to the Treasury, with a view of assisting you in obtaining the difference between the sum you had received, and that which had been earned by your vessel, according to the usual rate of compensation in the transport service; and I am sorry to inform you that the an∣swer which I have received affords me no reason to believe that this moderate demand will be satisfied. According to the legal opinions which you have taken, you can have no remedy in the ordinary course of justice, and the result of my applications convinces me that so far from obtaining from the English Government indemnity for your losses, it is not likely that you will receive the residue of the compensation due for the use of your vessel in the transportation of a number of the King's troops to the West Indies. Under these circumstances, I think it my duty to recommend to you to relinquish all farther solicitation, and to return home without delay.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Hungerford Coffee-house, Strand,</HI>
<DATE><HI>London,</HI> 4<HI>th of May,</HI> 1800.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have perused the narrative relative to the conduct of Captain Potter, with respect to the American ship Enterprise, and find the statement true and correct, to the time when that ship arrived at Barbadoes: In a few days afterwards I went with the regiment to which I belonged to St. Domingo.</P>
<P>The attention of myself and brother officers to you and your ship's company, which you have mentioned in such hand∣some terms, was no more than was due to people who had so humanely come to the relief of a ship in the miserable and distressed condition in which the Isabella transport then was; and I should think it a want of justice and candour not to acknowledge in this public manner, the obligation I and those under my command were under to you and Captain St. Barbe, for saving us in all probability from destruction.</P>
<P>When Captain Potter insisted upon making prize of your ship, I interceded with him as much as in my power, repre∣senting to him that he could not condemn her; and that even if he could, (<HI>even if she belonged to our most inveterate enemy), yet, on account of the humane and generous manner in which you and Captain St. Barbe had behaved to us, she ought to be re∣stored.</HI> Finding I could make no impression on him by calm remonstrances, I assumed a tone of authority, and <HI>in∣sisted</HI> he should: on which he produced to me a letter of marque, and declared that if I interposed in liberating his prize, I must be answerable to his owners.</P>
<P>When at Teneriffe, I again urged him to discharge the Enterprise; at the same time informing him, that as there
<PB N="52" REF="038531_0050_101251066AE05568"/>
was no other ship to be had at the island, and as I con∣ceived from the situation of public affairs a rupture between Great Britain and Spain might be apprehended, in which case the troops under my command might be detained pri∣soners of war, I would take upon myself, with the consent of you and Captain St. Barbe, to charter that ship in the name of Government, to carry as many of the detachment as she could to Barbadoes. He peremptorily refused to relinquish her as prize: on which I told him I was much concerned at being obliged to be witness of his infamous conduct, and that I was certain his owners, as well as every other person in England who should hear of the transaction, would highly condemn him.</P>
<P>At Teneriffe I reported his conduct to Mr. Favene, the British Consul there; and at Barbadoes to Admiral Sir John Laforey, commander in chief of his Majesty's fleet at that island, and also to his Excellency Governor Ricketts, who all expressed their opinions, that his treatment of you and Cap∣tain St. Barbe was cruel and oppressive in the extreme; and further, when at Barbadoes, I made an affidavit of the facts before a magistrate, in which I was joined by Captain Davis, and should also have been joined by Captain Thomas, but he was prevented, being obliged to go on board a ship which was under way for St. Domingo.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, I trust it will be manifest to all who shall read the narrative of your sufferings, that those who had the best opportunity of observation, were perfectly satisfied of the iniquity of Captain Potter's conduct. As to myself, I shall ever retain the most grateful remembrance of the obligation I owe to you and Captain St. Barbe; and am, Sir,</P>

<P>Being called upon by Mr. Soren, proprietor of the cargo of the ship Enterprise, which was taken possession of by the Isabella letter of marque, conveying troops to the West Indies, to state circumstances relative to the capture of the said ship, on or about the 23d of February, 1796: I do hereby affirm, that the ship Isabella was in the greatest distress at that period, having sprung a dangerous leak, in consequence of which it was deemed expedient to make signals of distress to a ship in sight, which proved to be the Enterprise; the Captain of which ship, (in my opinion, prompted by humanity alone, as he might easily have avoided us by superior sailing,) came down to our relief. Captain Potter, commanding the Isa∣bella, seized the American ship and took her into Teneriffe, on pretence of her having enemy's property on board. The Isabella being then condemned, the Enterprise was fitted up as a transport, and in that capacity conveyed, to the best of my recollection, about 150 soldiers to Barbadoes.</P>
