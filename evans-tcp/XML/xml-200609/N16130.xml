<L>From shades of death does neighbour <HI>John</HI> arise?</L>
<L>Ingenious <HI>John!</HI> whose death we vainly mourn'd,</L>
<L>From nine long years captivity return'd!</L>

<LG>
<L>Thrice welcome <HI>John!</HI> while joy his voice sur∣press'd,</L>
<L>He said; and ardent seiz'd him to his breast;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="020676_0003_0FB0A3B3EB923490"/>
To break the silence each essay'd in vain,</L>
<L>And tears of joy descend like show'rs of rain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then to salute him each in turn came nigh;</L>
<L>The briny dew descends from ev'ry eye;</L>
<L>(More grateful welcome, to a generous mind</L>
<L>Than all the forms of complaisance refin'd!)</L>
<L>Affecting scene! a pause of silence reigns,</L>
<L>That sympathetic feeling best explains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>William</HI> at length with feeble utt'rance cries,</L>
<L>And dost thou live! and dost thou bless my eyes!</L>
<L>We, since the bloody fight, have thought thee dead,</L>
<L>And for thee many bitter tears have shed.</L>
<L>Compose your throbbing bosom and relate</L>
<L>If ought you know of little <HI>Nelly'</HI>s fate:</L>
<L>And how your presence operates at home,</L>
<L>For, by your course, from there you seem'd to come.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>John</HI> slowly then his answer thus address'd;</L>
<L>What various passions labour in my breast!</L>
<L>To see you I dissolve in joys excess;</L>
<L>But my domestic woes you well may guess!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My <HI>Nelly</HI> is return'd, from regions wild:</L>
<L>I savage hands, I found my darling child:</L>
<L>I, with emotions quite unknown before,</L>
<L>With her this morning enter'd at my door:</L>
<L>My extacy improv'd my <HI>Phebe'</HI>s charms,</L>
<L>Who, screeching, threw herself into my arms;</L>
<L>We eagerly prolong the fond embrace,</L>
<L>And silent tears descend from either face:</L>
<L>The dear extatic scene no words can show,</L>
<L>And none but by experiment can know.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then I present her <HI>Nelly</HI> to her view,</L>
<L>Who now by certain marks alone she knew;</L>
<L>The child with melting ardour she caress'd;</L>
<L>Dissolv'd in transport held her to her breast.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="020676_0004_0FB0A3B72D9484A0"/>
And yet it seem'd my eye could plainly trace</L>
<L>Some bitter agitation in her face.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now to my neighbour <HI>Charles</HI> I gave my hand,</L>
<L>Who seem'd in discomposure strange to stand;</L>
<L>But when his lips declare the dreadful tale</L>
<L>With horror chill'd my feeble sinews fail!</L>
<L>My charming fair! my soul's delight and pride!</L>
<L>No longer mine; but <HI>Charles'</HI>s wedded bride!</L>
<L>Inur'd to woes of almost every kind,</L>
<L>Nought else methought could have depress'd my mind;</L>
<L>My fundamental comfort from me torn,</L>
<L>The world appear'd a wilderness forlorn!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I sat me down, with dumb amazement press'd,</L>
<L>Contending passions boiling in my breast;</L>
<L>My wife's inconstancy at length reprove,</L>
<L>And angrily upbraid the fair I love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then she, pale, trembling, with a piteous air,</L>
<L>My dearest spouse awhile your censure spare!</L>
<L>Hear my defence (I sink with woe oppress'd)</L>
<L>Nor more, but fainting, lean'd upon my breast:</L>
<L>In livid paleness cold, and void of breath,</L>
<L>Her eyes were fix'd, as in the sleep of death:</L>
<L>Remorse, love, pity, all my bosom tear.</L>
<L>While on her couch I place the breathless fair:</L>
<L>For her recov'ry ev'ry measure try'd;</L>
<L>While deedless <HI>Charles</HI> remain'd as petrify'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now she almost seem'd to gain her breath:</L>
<L>Now seem'd declining, near the verge of death:</L>
<L>But when her vital warmth return'd apace,</L>
<L>From sweat profuse, I gently wip'd her face.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then she at length reviving, turn'd her head</L>
<L>And with a melting look, she sweetly said:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Was it, my <HI>John,</HI> your kind officious care,</L>
<L>Recall'd my spirit to the vital air:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="020676_0005_0FB0A3B96C738828"/>
With joy I see you still regard your wife;</L>
<L>Who cannot cease to love you more than life.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When <HI>William</HI> came, your fate to let me know,</L>
<L>And though in tears, yet strove to soothe my woe:</L>
<L>How could I doubt? for to confirm the news,</L>
<L>He bro't your stockings, writings, coat, and shoes;</L>
<L>Bought by <HI>Skenevus,</HI> in the fatal wood;</L>
<L>From him who boasted he had shed your blood.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Each foll'wing circumstance confirm'd the same:</L>
<L>Letters, returns of war, and common fame,</L>
<L>By all with utmost confidence believ'd,</L>
<L>Till I this morning your approach perceiv'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My woes to tell, would be a grievous tale!</L>
<L>My spirits at the recollection fail!</L>
<L>A pause ensues, and tears of silence flow:</L>
<L>Then she again resumes her strain of woe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My sorrow pierc'd my soul with deadly smart:</L>
<L>I mourn'd in bitter anguish of my heart:</L>
<L>My spouse no more, and ev'ry comfort <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led:</L>
<L>My tears bedew'd my solitary bed:</L>
<L>Your cruel slaughter on my spirit preys,</L>
<L>Long wakeful nights, and melancholy days.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At length the foe, by frequent inroads wide,</L>
<L>Spread fire and slaughter round, on ev'ry side,</L>
<L>When by their flight I lose my choicest friends,</L>
<L>Each to his own his whole attention bends;</L>
<L>Forlorn, abandon'd, wretched, was my case!</L>
<L>Destruction yawning, star'd me in the face!</L>
<L>No sustenance to take! nor pow'r to fly!</L>
<L>My own, and tender daughter's fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e seem'd nigh!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now haply did our neighbour <HI>James</HI> appear;</L>
<L>With wife and family he shelter'd here;</L>
<L>Too poor to journey from his native place,</L>
<L>'Mong strangers to support his num'rous race;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="020676_0006_0FB0A3BAEB390870"/>
Together long in safety we abide,</L>
<L>By slaught'ring bands alarm'd on ev'ry side.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But when I lost my dear, my only child,</L>
<L>With sorrow stung, with dire distraction wild,</L>
<L>I bid adieu to ev'ry comfort here:</L>
<L>No hope remain'd, nor ought remain'd to fear:</L>
<L>My spirits fail'd: my wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sting frame decay'd:</L>
<L>While death invok'd in vain, withheld his aid▪</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But fortitude at length on mis'ry grows,</L>
<L>And ours abate by seeing others woes:</L>
<L>So time in part assuag'd my grief again;</L>
<L>As reason reasum'd her wonted reign:</L>
<L>And num'rous instances around the land,</L>
<L>Of neighbours murder'd by the vengeful hand;</L>
<L>Where children, matron, husband, aged sire,</L>
<L>By unrelenting slaughterers expire,</L>
<L>Made me forget my private grief in part;</L>
<L>While sympathetic horror fill'd my heart:</L>
<L>Such was my case while circling seasons roll,</L>
<L>The recollection rankles in my soul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now at length the bloody contest ends:</L>
<L>Again I see my dear returning friends;</L>
<L><HI>James,</HI> and his family recross the plain;</L>
<L>In solitude I sit me down again;</L>
<L>No husband, friend, nor sire, to till my land,</L>
<L>'Till <HI>Charles</HI> atlength extends the helping hand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To hymenial bands he woo'd me long,</L>
<L>With tender care and importuning tongue:</L>
<L>Long time his suit I firmly did withstand,</L>
<L>But through advice I lately gave my hand:</L>
<L><HI>William</HI> advis'd the deed; of him inquire:</L>
<L>Your heart with love and pity, he'll inspire;</L>
<L>As your return my melting soul does move,</L>
<L>And lights up more than all my former love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="020676_0007_0FB0A3BC24291868"/>
<L><HI>Charles</HI> interrupting angrily replies,</L>
<L>Ungrateful woman! fickle, and unwise!</L>
<L>Does his return your love of me destroy?</L>
<L>And must my absence then complete your joy?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Know <HI>John</HI> you cannot hunt me from the place,</L>
<L>Like guilty fugitive, or fellon base;</L>
<L>But if my presence much offend your eyes;</L>
<L>As none a rival's company can prize,</L>
<L>Go visit <HI>William,</HI> once your dearest friend;</L>
<L>This afternoon I'll also there attend;</L>
<L>In him no partiality has place:</L>
<L>On his arbitrament I'll risk the case.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When with returning strength my <HI>Phebe</HI> rose,</L>
<L>To shun his presence, with his terms I close:</L>
<L>For though my soul adores the blameless fair;</L>
<L>What husband can a rival husband bear?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>You know the case, then <HI>William</HI> frank replies,</L>
<L>None was to blame, none need apologize;</L>
<L>Though for this sad event, your grief I share;</L>
<L>Your faithful spouse the error will repair,</L>
<L>And though your rival's lot must galling be,</L>
<L>Her choice is final, and her will is free.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now they dine, the table richly stor'd;</L>
<L>Their guest partakes the dainties of their board,</L>
<L>His soul revived, his failing strength increas'd,</L>
<L>And social conversation crowns the feast.</L>
</LG>

<L>They sated rose when <HI>Sol,</HI> with potent ray,</L>
<L>Two hours had journey'd on his evening way;</L>
<L>Then <HI>William,</HI> smiling on his welcome guest,</L>
<L>These words with free benevolence expres'd;</L>
<L>Since we, beyond our utmost hope, obtain</L>
<L>The happiness of seeing you again,</L>
<L>We yield this evening, with attentive ear,</L>

<L><PB N="9" REF="020676_0008_0FB0A3BDD2769000"/>
Nor will it your tranquillity destroy,</L>
<L>For mis'ries wholly past are present joy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Says <HI>John,</HI> tho' pleasant 'tis to know them past,</L>
<L>The dread ideas will forever last;</L>
<L>When silent night her sable curtain spreads,</L>
<L>And balmy sleep his kind oblivion sheds,</L>
<L>Their images horrific rise in view,</L>
<L>And all the frightful tragedy renew;</L>

<LG>
<L>THE time, and place of our unhappy fight,</L>
<L>To you at large were needless to recite:</L>
<L>When in the wood our fierce inhuman foes,</L>
<L>With piercing yell from circling ambush rose:</L>
<L>A sudden volley rends the vaulted sky;</L>
<L>Their painted bodies hideous to the eye;</L>
<L>They rush, like hellish furies on our bands,</L>
<L>Their slaughter weapons brandish'd in their hands.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then we with equal fury join th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> fight,</L>
<L>E'er <HI>Phebus</HI> gain'd his full meridian height:</L>
<L>Nor ceas'd the horrors of the bloody fray,</L>
<L>Till he had journey'd half his evening way.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now hand to hand, the contest is for life,</L>
<L>With bay'net, tom'kawk, sword, and scalping knife:</L>
<L>Now more remote the work of death we ply,</L>
<L>And thick as ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l the show'ring bullets fly:</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="020676_0009_0FB0A3BF2363A970"/>
Full many a hardy warrior sinks supine,</L>
<L>Yells, shrieks, groans, shouts, and thund'ring vol∣lies join;</L>
<L>The dismal din the ringing forest fills,</L>
<L>The sounding echo roars along the hills.</L>
<L>Our friends and foes lie struggling in their blood,</L>
<L>An undistinguish'd carnage strews the wood;</L>
<L>And ev'ry streamlet drinks the crimson flood.</L>
<L>True valour, stubbornness, and fury here,</L>
<L>There fell revenge, despair and spite appear;</L>
<L>Long rag'd surrounding death, and no deliv'r∣ance near,</L>
<L>While mangled friends, nor fated yet to die,</L>
<L>Implore our aid in vain with feeble cry.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of two departments were the assailing fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></L>
<L>Wild savage natives lead the first of those;</L>
<L>Their almost naked frames, of various dies,</L>
<L>And rings of black, and red, surround their eyes:</L>
<L>On one side they present a shaven head;</L>
<L>The naked half of the vermillion red;</L>
<L>In spots the party-colour'd face they drew,</L>
<L>Beyond description horrible to view;</L>
<L>Their ebon looks in braid, with paint o'er spread;</L>
<L>The sliver'd ears depending from the head;</L>
<L>Their gaudry my descriptive pow'r exceeds,</L>
<L>In plumes of feathers, glitt'ring plates, and beeds.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With them of parricides a bloody band,</L>
<L>Assist the ravage of their parent land:</L>
<L>With equal dress, and arms, and savage arts;</L>
<L>But more than savage rancour in their hearts.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>These for the first attack their force unite;</L>
<L>And most sustain the fury of the sight;</L>
<L>Their rule of warfare, devastation dire,</L>
<L>By undistinguish'd plunder, death, and fire;</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="020676_0010_0FB0A3C2C1BADF00"/>
They torture man and beast, with barb'rous rage,</L>
<L>Nor tender infant spare, nor rev'rend sage.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O'er them a horrid monster bore command,</L>
<L>Whose inauspicious birth disgrac'd our land,</L>
<L>By malice urg'd to ev'ry barb'rous art;</L>
<L>Of cruel temper; but of coward heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The second was a reneg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> crew,</L>
<L>Who arm, and dress as Christian nations do,</L>
<L>Led by a chief who bore the first command;</L>
<L>A bold invader of his native land.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such was the bloody fight: and such the foe:</L>
<L>Our smaller force return'd them blow for blow,</L>
<L>By turns successfully their force defy'd;</L>
<L>And conquest wav'ring seem'd from side to side.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But on the horrid fight I dwell no more,</L>
<L>Which from returning friends you've heard before,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At length too far advent'ring from the ground,</L>
<L>The savages encircled me around:</L>
<L>Each grisly monster drew his bloody dart;</L>
<L>My hair stood up and terror froze my heart:</L>
<L>To one I yield, a chief of vissage mild;</L>
<L>The aged chief receives me as his child,</L>
<L>Repress'd the fury of the circling band,</L>
<L>And warded ev'ry blow with guardian hand:</L>
<L>While I, aghast, and shiv'ring at their sight,</L>
<L>To my deliv'rer clung with mortal fright.</L>

<L>A hemlock shade impervious to the day;</L>

<LG>
<L>(And when a monster of the associate band,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>They left him and return'd to join the fight,</L>
<L>He struggled long, then rose at length upright;</L>
<L>I slowly walk'd before my guardian guide,</L>
<L>The bloody victim halting at my side;</L>
<L>At length he faintly realing to and fro,</L>
<L>A passing savage gave the final blow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then next we pass a gloomy thicket near,</L>
<L>(The distant battle sounding in the ear)</L>
<L>There sat the premier of the scalping bands,</L>
<L>His head reclining on his trembling hands;</L>
<L>He fierce menaces vents, with brow severe,</L>
<L>And villain, dog and rebel, fill my ear;</L>
<L>But I proceeded with my friendly guide,</L>
<L>Nor answer'd aught, nor turn'd my head aside.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Soon we o'ertook a herd of black, and white,</L>
<L>Who bore a wounded officer from fight:</L>
<L>Another guard, with pris'ners I espy,</L>

<L>The guard receiv'd us in the open wood;</L>

<L>The briars my painful, naked limbs had torn;</L>

<L>My dear unhappy spouse, and darling child,</L>

<L>The combatants returning, 'camp around;</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not half the savages return'd from fight;</L>
<L>They to their native wilds had sped their flight;</L>
<L>Those that remain'd a long encampment made,</L>
<L>And rising fires illumin'd all the shade:</L>
<L>In vengeance for their num'rous brothers slain,</L>
<L>For torture sundry pris'ners they retain;</L>
<L>And three fell monsters, horrible to view,</L>

<L>I saw the Gen'ral slowly passing by,</L>

With lifted cane the Gen'ral thus replies,</L>

<L>For help the wretched victim vainly cries,</L>
<L>With supplicating voice and ardent eyes;</L>
<L>With horror chill'd, I turn away my face,</L>
<L>While instantly they bear him from the place.</L>
<L>Dread scene! with anguish stung <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iely groan,</L>

<L>When through the grove the flaming fires arise,</L>
<L>And loud resound the tortur'd pris'ners cries;</L>
<L>Still as their pangs are more or less extreme,</L>
<L>The bitter groan is heard, or sudden scream:</L>

<LG>
<L>Now from this awful region of the dead</L>

<L>Some friendly shallop thither waft me o'er!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Methought a rugged hilloc was my bed;</L>
<L>A rocky fragment underneath my head;</L>
<L>A bloody savage crew beside me stood;</L>
<L>Behind me lay a howling desert wood;</L>

<L>When now <HI>Aurora</HI> spangled o'er the skies,</L>
<L>From gentle sleep we hastily arise;</L>
<L>The blazing fire again prepare with haste,</L>
<L>And each again partakes a full repast:</L>
<L>Bright <HI>Phebus</HI> climbs, along his morning way;</L>
<L>And darts across the wood his genial ray;</L>
<L>The birds, with songs, awake the sounding plains,</L>
<L>And chant along the hill, melodious strains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then on we journey, as the day before,</L>
<L>Fair winding streams, and spacious deserts o'er,</L>
<L>Nor e'er the lengthy, weary journey close,</L>
<L>Till flaming <HI>Sol</HI> had three times set and rose;</L>
<L>Inflam'd by sultry heat each tedious day,</L>
<L>And chill'd in open air each night we lay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Extended swamps we pass, and thickets drear;</L>
<L>And flow'ry lawns where savage huts appear;</L>
<L>And plains, and heaths, and fertile vallies wide,</L>
<L>Where deep, majestic rivers gentle glide,</L>
<L>Thro' groves of pine we go, and hemlock shades,</L>
<L>O'er bogs, and sable rills, and grassy glades;</L>
<L>Meandring brooks, by willows overhung,</L>
<L>Where little warblers tune the charming song;</L>
<L>And now a path obscure describ'd our way;</L>
<L>And now o'er trackless heights our journey lay;</L>
<L>At length we from a hill their village spy,</L>
<L>A rising green, delightful to the eye:</L>
<L>An ample lake before in prospect lays,</L>
<L>Beside a silver stream meandring strays,</L>
<L>There spacious fields of corn the eye delight,</L>
<L>And fair extensive meadows charm the sight.</L>

<L>My keeper gently struck, then urg'd my flight,</L>
<L>Between the ranks I fled with all my might.</L>

<L>As when some farmer blest with plenteous yield,</L>

These thoughts incessant did my bosom rend,</L>

<L>One morning, with <HI>Aurora</HI> streak'd the skies,</L>
<L>By hunger pinch'd, from slumber I arise;</L>
<L>With musket walking forth, a fawn I slew,</L>
<L>With joy the spotted victim home I drew,</L>
<L>They quickly dress it, and a part they boil,</L>
<L>And all approve my conduct with a smile,</L>
<L>Then when our plentiful repast was o'er,</L>
<L>By words and signs they bid me seek for more;</L>
<L>I took my gun and cross'd the narrow plain,</L>
<L>Determining to not return again,</L>

<L>But now I soon the pleasant walk forsake,</L>
<L>And o'er the hill my speedy journey take,</L>

<L>With eager haste I journey'd all the day;</L>
<L>Hope urg'd my flight, and terror wing'd my way:</L>

<L>I doubted not they there would shed my blood;</L>
<L>I sweat like rain, with burning heat oppress'd,</L>
<L>With palpitation heav'd my panting breast.</L>

<L>At length departing <HI>Sol</HI> with milder blaze,</L>

<L>A porcupine I happen'd now to slay,</L>
<L>To one with hunger spent, a welcome prey.</L>
</LG>

<L>Beneath the covert of a woody hill,</L>
<L>Where through the herbage creeps a silent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill,</L>

<L>Of barks and broken limbs a fire I make;</L>
<L><PB N="28" REF="020676_0027_0FB0A3E06E1666A0"/>
With eager haste my bleeding prey I dress'd,</L>

<L>A gazing row around the fire there stood;</L>
<L>The rising flame illumin'd all the wood:</L>

<L>My native tongue I scarcely had retain'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With him once walking forth at early day,</L>
<L>O'er savage hills to hunt the savage prey,</L>
<L>Through craggy ways our leisure walk we take,</L>
<L>Where on the mountain lies a chrystal lake;</L>
<L>Loud winds of autumn sweep the dreary skies,</L>
<L>Beneath the blast the raging billows rise,</L>
<L>With broken surge the roaring water toils,</L>
<L>On lonely shores and solitary isles;</L>
<L>The vapours grimly gather in the skies,</L>
<L>Along the wood the snowy tempest flies;</L>
<L>The chilling gale, inclement, loud and strong,</L>
<L>The naked forest lashing howls along;</L>
<L>But we array'd in savage garments warm,</L>
<L>With ease sustain the sury of the storm.</L>

<LG>
<L>And now the snowy clouds, o'erblown at last,</L>

<L>Serene and mild appears the face of day;</L>
<L>And <HI>Sol</HI> in splendor journeys on his way.</L>

<L>Then we the mountain's head sublime ascend,</L>

<L>And on the thirtieth day complete their toils,</L>

<L>The fierce invading foe, with slaught'ring hand,</L>

Among the guards, my rifle greets my sight,</L>
<L>Prize once to him who took me in the fight:</L>
<L>My anxious eye then hastily surveys,</L>
<L>The savage captive, by the rising blaze;</L>
<L>In him, with agitation, lo I trace,</L>
<L>The features of that gen'rous warrior's face!</L>
<L>What various grief at once my bosom rends!</L>
<L>My country, consort, child, and suff'ring friends!</L>
<L>My agitation kindles in my face,</L>
<L>The guard with fury spurn me from the place.</L>
<L>The shades of night had now involv'd the sky,</L>
<L>I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o my neighb'ring hut all trembling fly;</L>
<L>Shall I, I cry'd, a wretched slave remain?</L>
<L>My child unfoster'd wear the captive chain?</L>
<L>My spouse bewail our fate with wringing hands?</L>
<L>And these, my friends, be slain by tort'ring bands!</L>
<L>One desp'rate stratagem, I dare to try,</L>
<L>Retrieve our fortune, or in tortures die.</L>
<L>Adjoining mine a spacious hut there lay,</L>
<L>Where they had stow'd their choicest spoils away;</L>
<L>The sides were wood the roof was thatch'd with hay;</L>
<L>With throbbing bosom, and with trembling hand,</L>
<L>Upon its roof I plac'd a flaming brand;</L>
<L>With growing force, the curling flames arise;</L>
<L>The savages collect, with wild surprise;</L>
<L>The pris'ners safe, the guards assisting came,</L>
<L>To save their precious plunder from the flame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With nimble hand I cut the pris'ners free;</L>
<L>Then running forth, I bade them follow me;</L>
<L>Toward the river, we direct our flight;</L>

A lengthy paddle in its bottom lay;</L>
<L>The knot too tight, we jerk the stake away;</L>
<L>We hurry in, and shoot along the stream;</L>
<L>Our heaving bosoms swell with joy extreme.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The aged chief, in transport of his joys,</L>
<L>Triumphant rais'd aloud his shouting voice,</L>
<L>Through all the vale the ringing echo flew;</L>
<L>The foe attend, they answer and pursue:</L>
<L>In vain along the shore a search they made:</L>
<L>In vain they shot amid the sable shade;</L>
<L>Along the raging stream we silent steer,</L>
<L>Their distant clamour dying in the ear;</L>
<L>Congratulate each other with delight,</L>
<L>And urge, with ev'ry limb, our rapid flight.</L>
<L>The thankful chief caress'd me, though unknown;</L>
<L>Then I to him my obligation own;</L>
<L>My gifts and me he recollects with joy,</L>
<L>And mutual gratitude our tongues employ.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Gay shone the starry pavement of the sky,</L>
<L>No other light, as yet, inform'd the eye:</L>
<L>On either side we just descry the shore,</L>
<L>The precipices seem'd high jutting o'er;</L>
<L>Through all the pass the raging torrent roars,</L>
<L>The stormy current thunders on the shores.</L>
<L>The chief the dang'rous pass well understood,</L>
<L>And kept, with artful hand, the middle flood;</L>
<L>While with the paddle he directs our course,</L>
<L>We ply by turns the stake with all our force.</L>
<L>And now, no more the rocky shores arise,</L>

<L>We tread the plain, the bending stream forsake,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now again we took our hasty way;</L>
<L>Again along a path our journey lay;</L>
<L>A tedious plain we tread with toil oppress'd,</L>
<L>Till <HI>Phebus</HI> low descended in the west;</L>
<L>At length the village greets our longing eyes,</L>
<L>Beside a spacious, fertile mead it lies;</L>
<L>A river winds along the flow'ry vale,</L>
<L>With bord'ring willows waving in the gale.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As near the town, the pleasant path we go,</L>
<L>Along the shore, with weary steps and slow;</L>
<L>The chief we seek perchance toward us stalks,</L>
<L>And sundry little ones attend his walks;</L>
<L>His stature huge, and as in thought profound,</L>
<L>His jetty eyes were turn'd toward the ground.</L>
<L>But when he cast his eyes along the shore,</L>
<L>And saw his friend he thought to see no more,</L>
<L>With shouts of joy he leaps along the strand;</L>
<L>With answ'ring joy his friend extends the hand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our leader now again relates in brief,</L>
<L>His journey, suff'rings, danger, and relief:</L>
<L>And then, his interesting tale to close,</L>
<L>His fellow suff'rer and deliv'rer shows:</L>
<L>The stranger view'd us, with attentive face,</L>
<L>And shook us by the hand, with friendly grace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I view his little train, with strange surprise,</L>
<L>A girl surpassing fair attracts my eyes;</L>
<L>Her pretty mein, and open vissage mild,</L>
<L>Awoke the dear remembrance of my child;</L>
<L>The scar upon her wrist I then survey'd,</L>
<L>And mark beneath her chin, by nature made;</L>

<HI>George</HI> to behold my consternation smil'd,</L>
<L>Confirming her indeed to be my child,</L>
<L>Through all my soul what melting passions reign!</L>
<L>Paternal fondness glows in ev'ry vein;</L>
<L>I seize my lovely child in strict embrace;</L>
<L>With tears of joy bedew her blooming face;</L>
<L>When she by struggles, trembling with surprise,</L>
<L>Escapes my arms, and to the village flies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The stranger at my conduct seem'd to stare:</L>
<L>Our chief inform'd him of my errand there:</L>
<L>My purpos'd journey homeward through the wild:</L>
<L>My spouse at home, and this my only child:</L>
<L>Relates my captivation by his hands:</L>
<L>My tedious servitude in foreign lands:</L>
<L>His obligations to me for his life:</L>
<L>And wish to help me to my child and wife.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then he shall have his child, the chief reply'd,</L>
<L>And all assistance I can give beside:</L>
<L>Her captivator lives not far away,</L>
<L>To him her ransom I will freely pay.</L>

<L>Two days we journey'd through a fertile wild,</L>

<L>When weary now, I lead her by the hand;</L>
<L>With frequent tears she left the savage land.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The second day when <HI>Sol</HI> forsakes our eyes,</L>
<L>Along a little stream our journey lies;</L>
<L>Surrounding lawns and trees for fruit declare,</L>
<L>Some savage tribe did once inhabit there;</L>
<L>A lofty pile of stones engag'd our view,</L>
<L>Our guards each one a stone upon it threw:</L>
<L>It seem'd a tomb had there of old been rear'd;</L>
<L>And on a stone of state these lines appear'd,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" Beneath this earthy mound, in solemn shade,</L>
<L>The lovliest form of nature's work is laid:</L>
<L>Of open soul, estrang'd to specious rule:</L>
<L>Of simple manners, learn'd in nature's school:</L>
<L>Who by the hand of murder lost her breath,</L>
<L>To save a wretched captive slave from death:</L>
<L>" The slave detain'd in savage wilds unknown,</L>
<L>Through gratitude and love, inscrib'd this stone;</L>
<L>Dissolv'd in tears, erects it o'er her head,</L>
<L>With longings to partake her lowly bed:</L>
<L>Some future bard may weep these lines to read;</L>
<L>And to succeeding ages tell the deed."</L>
<L>Not far from there a cooling fountain flows,</L>
<L>Where we prepare to take our night's repose:</L>
<L>I ask'd the senior if the cause was known,</L>
<L>Of this huge pile and monumental stone.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" His venerable father, he reply'd,</L>
<L>A gallant warrior knew these regions wide;</L>
<L><PB N="52" REF="020676_0051_0FB0A4159854D220"/>
And often said that in his younger days,</L>
<L>A sachem this huge monument did raise:</L>
<L>That when this sachem and his warring band,</L>
<L>Had fought the whites, far in the southern land,</L>
<L>A beauteous youth they captive hither led,</L>
<L>Intent to sacrifice him to their dead:</L>
<L>The sachem's wife was of the christian race;</L>
<L>But took when young and foster'd in this place;</L>
<L>Their blooming daughter lov'd the captive swain,</L>
<L>And tenderly releas'd him from his chain;</L>
<L>Her treachery the warriors quickly found;</L>
<L>And shed her blood in vengeance on the ground:</L>
<L>The warriors took the beauteous youth again;</L>
<L>The chief with cost his respite did obtain:</L>
<L>The lovely virgin in the dust was laid,</L>
<L>And o'er her head a mound of earth was made;</L>
<L>The captive youth, with many a tear and groan,</L>
<L>Upon her tomb erects this sable stone;</L>
<L>Then leaning o'er her grave, with flowing tears,</L>
<L>The brother of the warrior slain appears;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The warrior slain in the fight in which he was taken.</NOTE></L>
<L>The youth beneath his vengeful weapon bled,</L>
<L>And on the tomb reclin'd his dying head;</L>
<L>The chief the youth beside his daughter laid,</L>
<L>And o'er them both a common tomb he made;</L>
<L>Then plac'd the sable stone above her head,</L>
<L>That future ages might revere the dead."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Through pathless woods from here we took our way,</L>
<L>Until the evening of the second day;</L>
<L>When now a narrow lake salutes our eyes,</L>
<L>And fires along its further shore arise;</L>
<L>Across the glossy flood our eyes survey,</L>
<L>The purple west reflects departing day;</L>

Pale <HI>Cynthia</HI> smiling shows her silver horn,</L>
<L>Far o'er the western gloomy wood forlorn:</L>
<L>Our lodging here, in usual form, we take,</L>
<L>High on a bank that overlooks the lake.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next morn o'er rising ground we took our way;</L>
<L>A savage town in distant prospect lay;</L>
<L>Nor human tracts, nor dwellings more appear,</L>
<L>While through a spacious wilderness we steer:</L>

<L>We view the habitations of the white.</L>

<L>Though urg'd to tarry, on the following day,</L>

<L>We slowly on our journey pass'd,</L>
<L>And safely at the port arriv'd at last;</L>
<L>Where, though remote from home and quite un∣known,</L>
<L>We readily obtain a sum on loan;</L>

<L>" I speed my way, by silver <HI>Luna</HI>'s beams,</L>
<L>O'er floating bridges, meads, and turbib streams:</L>
<L>The midnight breeze a fearful whisp'ring made,</L>
<L>Through rustling alders in the dreary shade;</L>
<L>The bord'ring pines beside the lonely vale,</L>
<L>With solemn murmurs load the hollow gale;</L>
<L>I trace the river's solitary shore,</L>
<L>The fire directs me through my open door;</L>
<L>In bed my sleeping <HI>Nelly</HI> I survey;</L>
<L>Prone on the floor my breathless <HI>Phebe</HI> lay,</L>
<L>In vain, with tears I shake your lifeless clay!</L>
<L>Through all my soul what sudden horrors dart!</L>
<L>I call my fair in anguish of my heart!</L>
<L>A scream ensues! I shudd'ring stand with fears!</L>
<L>Before my eyes your gliding ghost appears;</L>
<L>Though pale and trembling, lovely to my sight,</L>
<L>In winding-sheet array'd, of purest white!</L>
<L>By terror fix'd, to move, in vain I try'd;</L>
<L>" I come to bid a long farewel," you cry'd,</L>
<L>" A flash of light'ning justly struck me dead,</L>
<L>For having took a rival to your bed;</L>
<L>I well deserv'd your wrath, that caus'd my smart,</L>
<L>Nor was your frown unjust that pierc'd my heart;</L>
<L>Your dear possession is by fate denied,</L>
<L>For which with ever longing soul I sigh'd;</L>
<L>May ev'ry blessing all your days attend,</L>
<L>And guardian powers my tender child befriend;"</L>
<L>Dissolv'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> tears, I cry'd with grievous smart,</L>
<L>Forgive my cruel rage that wrung your heart;</L>
<L>My constant fair is blameless in my sight!</L>
<L>How can I thus survive my soul's delight?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" Thus while I spake, you glide to yonder vale;</L>
<L>A tender screech is heard along the gale,</L>
<L><PB N="59" REF="020676_0058_0FB0A4269E027AD8"/>
In bitter grief of heart, aloud I weep,</L>
<L>And steep'd in briny tears awake from sleep.</L>
<L>With boding fears I trembling rose forlorn,</L>
<L>When chanticleer foretold the coming morn."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" In flood of tears," replies his anxious spouse,</L>
<L>(Nor further utterance her grief allows)</L>
<L>" Though 'scap'd the dreadful night! till morning fair!</L>
<L>What pangs of keen regret my bosom tear!</L>
<L>By thoughts of your descease, beguil'd to wed,</L>
<L>Too late, I mourn the honour of my bed:</L>
<L>Nor <HI>Charles'</HI>s grief can I unpitying see;</L>
<L>The heavy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he guiltless bears for me!</L>
<L>His tender care! his generous desert!</L>
<L>Have made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> impression on my heart!</L>
<L>But he return'd who most my soul ador'd!</L>
<L>My ever gentle, ever faithful lord!</L>
<L>Endearing partner of my golden years!</L>
<L>Long mourn'd with bleeding heart and streaming tears!</L>
<L>And with him too my <HI>Nelly,</HI> wept in vain!</L>
<L>Our common care, our life, our union chain!</L>
<L>The flame anew through all my bosom glows!</L>
<L>My ravish'd soul no other passion knows!</L>
<L>And is my faithful <HI>John,</HI> long suff'rings past,</L>
<L>So ill requited by his spouse at last!</L>
<L>And have I thus dishonour'd his reward!</L>
<L>And marr'd the future bliss we might have shar'd?"</L>
<L>Then <HI>William</HI> thus to <HI>Charles:</HI> "surpr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se your care;</L>

<L>She cleaves to him a fond and faithful wife!</L>
<L>His tragic death we all with sorrow heard,</L>

<L>Yet, since he lives, her choice is wholly free:</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Charles</HI> then responsive, wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h indignant air:</L>
<L>No longer I'll obstruct the fawning pair;</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> me her faithless passion to regain</L>
<L>Entreaty low and blandishment were vain!</L>
<L>My ills are unforeseen event in part,</L>
<L>But just resentment rises in my heart:</L>
<L>My hared presence, does but give offence,</L>
<L>And wife, and friend, and rival, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hence:</L>

<L>And now fulfilling what his tongue declares,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for departure hastily prepares,</L>
<L>Though fortify'd by rage, he yields to woe;</L>
<L>At <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> tears of silence flow.</L>
<L>His piercing grief! they sympathizing spy,</L>
<L>The pitying tear distils from ev'ry eye,</L>
<L><HI>John,</HI> holding forth his watch, began to say,</L>
<L>" Accept this humble pledge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> attend your way,</L>
<L>Then let us part renew'd in friendship's flame,</L>
<L>Who hapless rivals guiltlessly became!"</L>

<LG>
<L><HI>Charles</HI> with neglect the offer'd present views,</L>
<L>And silently his hasty way pursues:</L>
<L>Their kind expostulation scorns to hear;</L>
<L>Nor reason's voice would penetrate his ear!</L>
<L><HI>William</HI> congratulates the constant pair:</L>
<L>And happiness succeeds their length of care!</L>
