<HEAD>THE AMERICAN VILLAGE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHERE yonder stream divides the fertile plain,</L>
<L>Made fertile by the labours of the swain;</L>
<L>And hills and woods high tow'ring o'er the rest,</L>
<L>Behold a village with fair plenty blest:</L>
<L>Each year tall harvests crown the happy field;</L>
<L>Each year the meads their stores of fragrance yield,</L>
<L>And ev'ry joy and ev'ry bliss is there,</L>
<L>And healthful labour crowns the flowing year.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THOUGH <HI>Goldsmith</HI> weeps in melancholy strains,</L>
<L>Deserted Auburn and forsaken plains,</L>
<L>And mourns his village with a patriot sigh,</L>
<L>And in that village sees Britannia die:</L>
<L>Yet shall this land with rising pomp divine,</L>
<L>In it's own splendor and Britannia's shine.</L>
<L>O muse, forget to paint her ancient woes,</L>
<L>Her Indian battles, or her Gallic foes;</L>
<L>Resume the pleasures of the rural scene,</L>
<L>Describe the village rising on the green,</L>
<L>It's harmless people, born to small command,</L>
<L>Lost in the bosom of this western land:</L>

So shall my verse run gentle as the floods,</L>
<L>So answer all ye hills, and echo all ye woods;</L>
<L>So glide ye streams in hollow channels pent,</L>
<L>Forever wasting, yet not ever spent.</L>
<L>Ye clust'ring boughs by hoary thickets bore!</L>
<L>Ye fields high waving with eternal corn!</L>
<L>Ye woodland nymphs the tender tale rehearse,</L>
<L>The fabled authors of immortal verse:</L>
<L>Ye Dryads fair, attend the scene I love,</L>
<L>And Heav'n shall centre in yon' blooming grove.</L>
<L>What tho' thy woods, AMERICA, contain</L>
<L>The howling forest, and the tiger's den,</L>
<L>The dang'rous serpent, and the beast of prey,</L>
<L>Men are more fierce, more terrible than they.</L>
<L>No monster with it's vile contagious breath,</L>
<L>No flying scorpion darting instant death;</L>
<L>No pois'nous adder, burning to enrage,</L>
<L>Has half the venom or has half the rage.</L>
<L>What tho' the Turk protests to heav'n his ire,</L>
<L>With lift up hand amidst his realms of fire;</L>
<L>And Russia's Empress sends her fleets afar,</L>
<L>To aid the havock of the burning war:</L>
<L>Their rage dismays not, and their arms in vain,</L>
<L>In dreadful fury bathe with blood the plain;</L>
<L>Their terrors harmless, tho' their story heard,</L>
<L>How this one conquer'd or was nobly spar'd:</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="012397_0004_0F893F5FE5BDBE40"/>
Vain is their rage, to us their anger vain,</L>
<L>The deep Atlantic raves and roars between.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To yonder village then will I descend,</L>
<L>There spend my days, and there my ev'nings spend;</L>
<L>Sweet haunt of peace whose mud' wall'd sides delight,</L>
<L>The rural mind beyond the city bright:</L>
<L>Their tops with hazles or with alders wove,</L>
<L>Remurmur magic to the neighb'ring grove;</L>
<L>And each one lab'ring in his own employ,</L>
<L>Comes weary home at night, but comes with joy:</L>
<L>The soil which lay for many thousand years</L>
<L>O'er run by woods, by thickets and by bears;</L>
<L>Now reft of trees, admits the chearful light,</L>
<L>And leaves long prospects to the piercing sight;</L>
<L>Where once the lynx nocturnal sallies made,</L>
<L>And the tall chesnut cast a dreadful shade:</L>
<L>No more the panther stalks his bloody rounds,</L>
<L>Nor bird of night her hateful note resounds;</L>
<L>Nor howling wolves roar to the rising moon,</L>
<L>As pale arose she o'er yon eastern down.</L>
<L>Some prune their trees, a larger load to bear</L>
<L>Of fruits nectarine blooming once a year:</L>
<L>See groaning waggons to the village come</L>
<L>Fill'd with the apple, apricot or plumb;</L>
<L>And heavy beams suspended from a tree,</L>
<L>To press their juice against the winter's day:</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="012397_0005_0F893F60A672FCB0"/>
Or see the plough torn through the new made field,</L>
<L>Ordain'd a harvest, yet unknown to yield.</L>
<L>The rising barn whose spacious floor receives</L>
<L>The welcome thousands of the wheaten sheaves,</L>
<L>And spreads it's arms to take the plenteous store,</L>
<L>Sufficient for its master and the poor:</L>
<L>For as Eumoeus us'd his beggar guest</L>
<L>The great Ulysses in his tatters drest:</L>
<L>So here fair Charity puts forth her hand,</L>
<L>And pours her blessings o'er the greatful land:</L>
<L>No needy wretch the rage of winter fears,</L>
<L>Secure he sits and spends his aged years,</L>
<L>With thankful heart to gen'rous souls and kind,</L>
<L>That save him from the winter and the wind.</L>

<L>A LOVELY island once adorn'd the sea,</L>
<L>Between New-Albion and the Mexic' Bay;</L>
<L>Whose sandy sides wash'd by the ocean wave,</L>
<L>Scarce heard a murmur but what the ocean gave:</L>
<L>Small it's circumference, or high it's coast,</L>
<L>But shady woods the happy isle could boast;</L>
<L>On ev'ry side new prospects catch'd the eye,</L>
<L>There rose blue mountains to the arched sky:</L>
<L>Here thunder'd ocean in conclusive throws,</L>
<L>And dash'd the island as it's waters rose:</L>
<L>Yet peaceful all within, no tumults there,</L>
<L>But fearless steps of the unhunted hare;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="012397_0006_0F893F62913906F0"/>
And nightly chauntings of the fearless dove,</L>
<L>Or blackbird's note, the harbinger of love.</L>
<L>So peaceful was this haunt that nature gave,</L>
<L>Still as the stars, and silent as the grave;</L>
<L>No loud applause there rais'd the patriot breast,</L>
<L>No shouting armies their mad joy confest,</L>
<L>For battles gain'd, or trophies nobly won,</L>
<L>Or nations conquer'd near the rising sun;</L>
<L>No clam'rous, crews, or wild nocturnal cheer,</L>
<L>Or murd' rous russians for no men were here.</L>
<L>On it's east end a grove of oak was seen,</L>
<L>And shrubby hazels fill'd the space between;</L>
<L>Dry alders too, and aspin leaves that shook</L>
<L>With ev'ry wind, conspir'd to shade a brook,</L>
<L>Whose gentle stream just bubbling from the ground,</L>
<L>Was quickly in the falter ocean drown'd.</L>
<L>Beyond whose fount, the center of the isle,</L>
<L>Wild plumb trees flourishe'd on the shaded soil.</L>
<L>In the dark bosom of this sacred wood,</L>
<L>Had fate but smil'd, some village might have stood</L>
<L>Secluded from the world, and all it's own,</L>
<L>Of other lands unknowing, and unknown.</L>
<L>Here might the hunter have destroy'd his prey,</L>
<L>Transfix'd the goat before the dawn of day;</L>
<L>And trudging homeward with his welcome load,</L>
<L>The fruit of wand'rings thro' each by-way road:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="012397_0007_0F893F62E65B5218"/>
Thrown down his burthen with the needless sigh,</L>
<L>And gladly feasted his small family.</L>
<L>Small fields had shen suffic'd, and grateful they,</L>
<L>The annual labours of his hands to pay;</L>
<L>And free his right to search the briny flood</L>
<L>For fish, or slay the creatures of the wood.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THUS spent his days in labour's pleasant, pain,</L>
<L>Had liv'd and dy'd the homely shepherd swain:</L>
<L>Had seen his children and his children's heirs,</L>
<L>The fruit of love and memory of years</L>
<L>To agriculture's first fair service bent,</L>
<L>The work of mortals, and their great intent,</L>
<L>So had the Sire his days of pleasure known,</L>
<L>And wish'd to change no country for his own:</L>
<L>So had he with his fair endearing wife,</L>
<L>Pass'd the slow circle of a harmless life;</L>
<L>With happy ignorance divinely blest,</L>
<L>The path, the centre and the home of rest.</L>
<L>Long might the sun have run his bright career,</L>
<L>And long the moon her mantled visage rear;</L>
<L>And long the stars their nightly vigils kept,</L>
<L>And spheres harmonious either sung or wept:</L>
<L>He had not dream'd of worlds besides his own,</L>
<L>And thought them only stars, beyond the moon;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="012397_0008_0F893F63A6EC4B60"/>
Enjoy'd himself, nor hear'd of future hell,</L>
<L>Or heav'n, the recompence of doing well;</L>
<L>Had scarcely thought of an eternal-state,</L>
<L>And left his being in the hands of fate.—</L>
<L>O had this isle such souls sublime contain'd,</L>
<L>And there for ages future sons remain'd,</L>
<L>But envious time conspiring with the sea,</L>
<L>Wash'd all it's landscapes, and it's groves away.</L>
<L>It's trees declining, stretch'd upon the sand,</L>
<L>No more their shadows throw across the land.</L>
<L>It's vines no more their clust'ring beauty show,</L>
<L>Nor sturdy oaks embrace the mountain's brow.</L>
<L>Bare sands alone now overwhelm the coast,</L>
<L>Lost in it's grandeur, and it's beauty lost.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THUS, tho' my fav'rite isle to ruin gone,</L>
<L>Inspires my sorrow, and demands my moon;</L>
<L>Yet this wide land it's place can well supply</L>
<L>With landscapes, hills and grassy mountains high.</L>
<L>O HUDSON! thy fair flood shall be my theme,</L>
<L>Thy winding river, or thy glassy stream;</L>
<L>On whose tall banks tremendous rocks I spy,</L>
<L>Dread nature in primaeval majesty.</L>
<L>Rocks, to whose summits clouds eternal cling,</L>
<L>Or clust'ring birds in their wild wood notes sing.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="012397_0009_0F893F64677885D0"/>
Hills, from whose sides the mountain echo roars,</L>
<L>Rebounding dreadful from the distant shores;</L>
<L>Or vallies, where refreshing breezes blow,</L>
<L>And rustic huts in fair confusion grow,</L>
<L>Safe from the winds, secur'd by mountains high,</L>
<L>That seem to hide the concave of the sky;</L>
<L>To whose top oft' the curious hind ascends,</L>
<L>And wonders where the arch'd horizon bends;</L>
<L>Pleas'd with the distant prospects rising new,</L>
<L>And hills o'er hills, a never ending view.</L>
<L>Through various paths with hasty step he scours,</L>
<L>And breathes the odours of surrounding flow'rs,</L>
<L>Caught from their bosoms by the fragrant breath,</L>
<L>Of western breezes, or the gale of death.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">South wind.</NOTE></L>
<L>Then low descending, seeks the humble dome,</L>
<L>And centres all his pleasures in his home,</L>
<L>'Till day returning, brings the welcome toil,</L>
<L>To clear the forest, or to tame the soil;</L>
<L>To burn the woods, or catch the tim'rous deer,</L>
<L>To scour the thicket, or contrive the snare.</L>

<L>SUCH was the life our great fore-fathers led,</L>
<L>The golden season now from BRITAIN fled,</L>
<L>E'er since dread commerce stretch'd the nimble sail,</L>
<L>And sent her wealth with ev'ry foreign gale.—</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="012397_0010_0F893F6529398338"/>
Strange fate, but yet to ev'ry county known,</L>
<L>To love all other riches but it's own.</L>
<L>Thus fell the mistress of the conquer'd earth,</L>
<L>Great ROME, who ow'd to ROMULUS her birth,</L>
<L>Fell to the monster Luxury, a prey,</L>
<L>Who forc'd a hundred nations to obey.</L>
<L>She whom nor mighty CARTHAGE could withstand,</L>
<L>Nor strong JUDEA'S once thrice holy land:</L>
<L>She all the west, and BRITAIN could subdue,</L>
<L>While vict'ry with the ROMAN eagles flew;</L>
<L>She, she herself eternal years deny'd,</L>
<L>Like ROME she conquer'd, but by ROME she dy'd:</L>
<L>But if AMERICA, by this decay,</L>
<L>The world itself must fall as well as she.</L>
<L>No other regions latent yet remain,</L>
<L>This spacious globe has been research'd in vain.</L>
<L>Round it's whole circle oft' have navies gone,</L>
<L>And found but sea or lands already known.</L>
<L>When she has seen her empires, cities, kings,</L>
<L>Time must begin to flap his weary wings;</L>
<L>The earth itself to brighter days aspire,</L>
<L>And wish to feel the purifying fire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOR think this mighty land of old contain'd</L>
<L>The plund'ring wretch, or man of bloody mind:</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="012397_0011_0F893F65E71124F8"/>
Renowned SACHEMS once their empires rais'd</L>
<L>On wholesome laws; and sacrifices blaz'd.</L>
<L>The gen'rous soul inspir'd the honest breast,</L>
<L>And to be free, was doubly to be blest:</L>
<L>'Till the east winds did here COLUMBUS blow,</L>
<L>And wond'ring nations saw his canvas flow.</L>
<L>'Till her CABOT descended on the strand,</L>
<L>And hail'd the beauties of the unknown land;</L>
<L>And rav'nous nations with industrious toil,</L>
<L>Conspir'd to rob them of their native soil:</L>
<L>Then bloody wars, and death and rage arose,</L>
<L>And ev'ry tribe resolv'd to be our foes.</L>
<L>Full many a feat of them I could rehearse,</L>
<L>And actions worthy of immortal verse:</L>
<L>Deeds ever glorious to the INDIAN name,</L>
<L>And fit to rival GREEK or ROMAN fame.</L>
<L>But one sad story shall my Muse relate,</L>
<L>Full of paternal love, and full of fate;</L>
<L>Which when ev'n yet the northern shepherd hears,</L>
<L>It swells his breast, and bathes his face in tears,</L>
<L>Prompts the deep groan, and lifts the heaving sigh,</L>
<L>Or brings soft torrents from the female eye.</L>

<L>FAR in the arctic skies, where HUDSON'S BAY</L>
<L>Rolls it's cold wave, and combats with the sea,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="012397_0012_0F893F66AAC4A778"/>
A dreary region lifts it's dismal head,</L>
<L>True sister to the regions of the dead.</L>
<L>Here thund'ring storms continue half the year,</L>
<L>Or deep-laid snows their joyless visage rear:</L>
<L>Eternal rocks, from whose prodigious steep</L>
<L>The angry tiger stuns the neighb'ring deep;</L>
<L>While through the wild wood, or the shrouded plain,</L>
<L>The moose deer seeks his food, but often seeks in vain.</L>
<L>Yet in this land, froze by inclement skies,</L>
<L>The Indian huts in wild succession rise;</L>
<L>And daily hunting, when the short-liv'd spring</L>
<L>Shoots joyous forth, th' industrious people bring</L>
<L>Their beaver spoils beneath another sky,</L>
<L>PORT NELSON, and each BRITISH factory:</L>
<L>In slender boats from distant lands they sail,</L>
<L>Their small masts bending to the inland gale,</L>
<L>On traffic sent to gain the little store,</L>
<L>Which keeps them plenteous, tho' it keeps them poor.</L>
<L>Hither CAFFRARO in his slighty boat,</L>
<L>One hapless spring his furry riches brought;</L>
<L>And with him came, for fail'd he not alone,</L>
<L>His consort COLMA, and his little son.</L>
<L>While yet from land o'er the deep wave he plough'd,</L>
<L>And tow'rds the shore with manly prowess row'd.</L>
<L>His barque unfaithful to it's trusted freight,</L>
<L>Sprung the large leak, the messenger of fate;</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="012397_0013_0F893F684C511F38"/>
But no lament or female cry was heard,</L>
<L>Each for their fate most manfully prepar'd,</L>
<L>From bubbling waves to send the parting breath</L>
<L>To lands of shadows, and the shade of death.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O FATE! unworthy such a tender train,</L>
<L>O day, lamented by the Indian swain!</L>
<L>Full oft' of it the strippling youth shall hear,</L>
<L>And sadly mourn their fortune with a tear:</L>
<L>The Indian maids full oft' the tale attend,</L>
<L>And mourn their COLMA as they'd mourn a friend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now while in waves the barque demerg'd, they strive,</L>
<L>Dead with despair, tho' nature yet alive:</L>
<L>Forth from the shore a friendly brother flew,</L>
<L>In one small boat, to save the drowning crew.</L>
<L>He came, but in his barque of trifling freight,</L>
<L>Could save but two, and one must yield to fate.</L>
<L>O dear CAFFRARO, said the hapless wife,</L>
<L>O save our son, and save thy dearer life:</L>
<L>'Tis thou canst teach him how to hunt the doe,</L>
<L>Transfix the buck, or tread the mountain snow.</L>
<L>Let me the sentence of my fate receive,</L>
<L>And to thy care my tender infant leave.</L>
<L>He sigh'd nor answer'd, but as firm as death,</L>
<L>Resolv'd to save her with his latest breath:</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="012397_0014_0F893F68EA776DF0"/>
And as suspended by the barque's low side,</L>
<L>He rais'd the infant from the chilling tide,</L>
<L>And plac'd it safe; he forc'd his COLMA too</L>
<L>To save herself, what more could mortal do?</L>
<L>But nobly scorning life, she rais'd her head</L>
<L>From the flush'd wave, and thus divinely said:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>OF life regardless, I to fate resign,</L>
<L>But thou, CAFFRARO, art forever mine.</L>
<L>O let thy arms no future bride embrace,</L>
<L>Remember COLMA, and her beauteous face,</L>
<L>Which won thee youthful in thy gayest pride,</L>
<L>With captives, trophies, victors at thy side;</L>
<L>Now I shall quick to blooming regions fly,</L>
<L>A spring eternal, and a nightless sky,</L>
<L>Far to the west, where radiant Sol descends,</L>
<L>And wonders where the arch'd horizon ends:</L>
<L>There shall my soul thy lov'd idea keep;</L>
<L>And 'till thy image comes, unceasing weep.</L>
<L>There, tho' the tiger is but all a shade,</L>
<L>And mighty panthers but the name they had;</L>
<L>And proudest hills, and lofty mountains there,</L>
<L>Light as the wind, and yielding as the air;</L>
<L>Yet shall our souls their ancient feelings have,</L>
<L>More strong, more noble than this side the grave.</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="012397_0015_0F893F69AA6C4290"/>
There lovely blossoms blow throughout the year,</L>
<L>And airy harvests rise without our care:</L>
<L>And all our fires and mighty ancestors,</L>
<L>Renown'd for battles and successful wars,</L>
<L>Behold their sons in fair succession rise,</L>
<L>And hail them happy to serener skies.</L>
<L>There shall I see thee too, and see with joy</L>
<L>Thy future charge, my much lov'd Indian boy:</L>
<L>The thoughtless infant, whom with tears I see,</L>
<L>Once sought my breast, or hung upon my knee;</L>
<L>Tell him, ah tell him, when in manly years,</L>
<L>His dauntless mind, nor death nor danger fears,</L>
<L>Tell him, ah tell him, how thy COLMA dy'd</L>
<L>His fondest mother, and thy youthful bride:</L>
<L>Point to my tomb thro' yonder furzy glade,</L>
<L>And show where thou thy much lov'd COLMA laid.</L>
<L>O may I soon thy blest resemblance see,</L>
<L>And my sweet infant all reviv'd in thee.</L>
<L>'Till then I'll haunt the bow'r or lonely shade,</L>
<L>Or airy hills for contemplation made,</L>
<L>And think I see thee in each ghostly shoal,</L>
<L>And think I clasp thee to my weary soul.</L>
<L>Oft, oft thy form to my expecting eye,</L>
<L>Shall come in dreams with gentle majesty;</L>
<L>Then shall I joy to find my bliss began</L>
<L>To love an angel, whom I lov'd a man!</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="012397_0016_0F893F6A6EEC0A08"/>
She said, and downward in the hoary deep</L>
<L>Plung'd her far form to everlasting sleep;</L>
<L>Her parting soul it's latest struggle gave,</L>
<L>And her last breath came bubbling thro' the wave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THEN sad CAFFRARO all his grief declares,</L>
<L>And swells the torrent of the gulph with tears;</L>
<L>And senseless stupid to the shore is borne</L>
<L>In death-like slumbers, 'till the rising morn,</L>
<L>Then sorrowing, to the sea his course he bent</L>
<L>Full sad, but knew not for what cause he went,</L>
<L>'Till, sight distressing, from the lonely strand,</L>
<L>He saw dead COLMA wafting to the land.</L>
<L>Then in a stupid agony of pray'r,</L>
<L>He rent his mantle, and he tore his hair;</L>
<L>Sigh'd to the stars, and shook his honour'd head,</L>
<L>And only wish'd a place among the dead!</L>
<L>O had the winds been sensible of grief,</L>
<L>Or whisp'ring angels come to his relief;</L>
<L>Then had the rocks not echo'd to his pain,</L>
<L>Nor hollow mountains answer'd him again:</L>
<L>Then had the floods their peaceful courses kept,</L>
<L>Nor the sad pine in all it's murmurs wept;</L>
<L>Nor pensive deer stray'd through the lonely grove,</L>
<L>Nor sadly wept the sympathising dove.—</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="012397_0017_0F893F6B2CB96AC8"/>
Thus far'd the fire through his long days of pain,</L>
<L>Or with his offspring rov'd the silent plain;</L>
<L>'Till years approaching, bow'd his sacred head</L>
<L>Deep in the dust, and sent him to the dead:</L>
<L>Where now perhaps in some strange fancy'd land,</L>
<L>He grasps the airy bow, and flies across the strand;</L>
<L>Or with his COLMA shares the fragrant grove,</L>
<L>It's vernal blessings, and the bliss of love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FAREWELL lamented paid, and whate'er state</L>
<L>Now class you round, and sinks you deep in fate;</L>
<L>Whether the firey kingdom of the sun,</L>

<L>Now fairest village of the fertile plain,</L>
<L>Made fertile by the labours of the swain;</L>
<L>Who first my drowsy spirit did inspire,</L>
<L>To sing of woods, and strike the rural lyre:</L>
<L>Who last shou'd see He wand'ring from thy cells,</L>
<L>And groves of oak where contemplation dwells.</L>
<L>Wou'd fate but raise me o'er the smaller cares,</L>
<L>Of Life unwelcome and distressful years,</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="012397_0018_0F893F6BEAD14208"/>
Pedantic labours and a hateful ease,</L>
<L>Which scarce the hoary wrinkled sage cou'd please.</L>
<L>Hence springs each grief, each long reflective sigh,</L>
<L>And not one comfort left but poetry.</L>
<L>Long, long ago with her I could have stray'd,</L>
<L>To woods, to thickets or the mountain shade;</L>
<L>Unfit for cities and the noisy throng,</L>
<L>The drunken revel and the midnight song;</L>
<L>The gilded beau and scenes of empty joy,</L>
<L>Which please a moment and forever die.</L>
<L>Here then shall center ev'ry wish, and all</L>
<L>The tempting beauties of this spacious ball:</L>
<L>No thought ambitious, and no bold design,</L>
<L>But heaven born contemplation shall be mine.</L>
<L>In yonder village shall my fancy stray,</L>
<L>Nor rove beyond the confines of to-day;</L>
<L>The aged volumes of some plain divine,</L>
<L>In broken order round my hut shou'd shine;</L>
<L>Whose solemn lines should soften all my cares,</L>
<L>And sound devotion to th' eternal stars:</L>
<L>And if one fin my rigid breast did stain,</L>
<L>Thou poetry shou'dst be the darling sin;</L>
<L>Which heav'n without repentance might forgive,</L>
<L>And which an angel might commit and live:</L>
<L>And where yon' wave of silent water falls,</L>
<L>O'er the smooth rock or Adamantine walls:</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="012397_0019_0F893F6CAEDB54B0"/>
The summer morns and vernal eves should see,</L>
<L>MILTON, immortal bard my company;</L>
<L>Or SHAKESPEARE, DRYDEN, each high sounding name,</L>
<L>The pride of BRITAIN, and one half her fame:</L>
<L>Or him who wak'd the fairy muse of old,</L>
<L>And pleasing tales of lands inchanted told.</L>
<L>Still in my hand, he his soft verse shou'd find</L>
<L>His verse, the picture of the poets mind:</L>
<L>Or heav'nly POPS, who now harmonious mourns,</L>
<L>"Like the rapt seraph that adores and burns."</L>
<L>Then in sharp satire, with a giant's might,</L>
<L>Forbids the blockhead and the fool to write:</L>
<L>And in the centre of the bards be shown</L>
<L>The deathless lines of godlike ADDISON;</L>
<L>Who, bard thrice glorious, all delightful flows,</L>
<L>And wrapt the soul of poetry in prose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOW cease, O muse, thy tender tale to chaunt,</L>
<L>The smiling village, or the rural haunt;</L>
<L>New scenes invite me, and no more I rove,</L>
<L>To tell of shepherds, or the vernal grove.</L>

<HEAD>THE FARMER'S WINTER EVENING, A POEM. To the NYMPH I never saw.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>FAR be the pleasures of the day,</L>
<L>And mirth and festive joy from me,</L>
<L>When cold December nips the plains,</L>
<L>Or frozen January reigns.</L>
<L>Far be the hunts-man's noisy horn,</L>
<L>And coursers fleet thro' thickets borne,</L>
<L>Swift as the wind, and far the sight,</L>
<L>Of snowy mountains, sadly white;</L>
<L>But thou, O night, with sober charms,</L>
<L>Shall clasp me in thy sable arms.</L>
<L>For thee I love the winter eve,</L>
<L>The noisy day for thee I leave.</L>
<L>Beneath some mountain's tow'ring height,</L>

<L>Where jovial swains, with heart sincere,</L>

Each tells his tale, or chaunts a song</L>
<L>Of her for whom he sigh'd so long;</L>
<L>Of CLARA fair, or FLORA coy,</L>
<L>Disdaining still her shepherd boy,</L>
<L>While near the hoary headed sage,</L>

<L>Describes his course of manly years,</L>

<L>How champion he with champions met,</L>

<L>And feats fit for renown in story.—</L>
<L>Thus spent in tales the ev'ning hour,</L>
<L>And quaffing juice of sober pow'r,</L>
<L>Which handsome KATE with malt did steep,</L>
<L>To lead on balmy visag'd sleep,</L>
<L>While her neat hand the milk pail strains,</L>
<L>A sav'ry supper for the swains.</L>

<L>In beechen bowl, to bring on sleep;</L>
<L>Love hath my mind in shackles kept,</L>

<L>Of rivers wide, and castles rare,</L>

<L>"A larger draught is yet in store,</L>

<HEAD>THE MISERABLE LIFE OF A PEDAGOGUE.</HEAD>
<L>To form the manners of our youth,</L>
<L>To guide them in the way of truth,</L>
<L>To lead them through the jarring schools,</L>
<L>Arts, sciences, and grammar rules;</L>
<L>Is certainly an arduous work,</L>

<L><PB N="23" REF="012397_0024_0F893F712BB7CD90"/>
And make a christian bite his nails,</L>
<L>For do his best, he surely fails;</L>
<L>And spite of all that some may say,</L>
<L>His praise is trifling as his pay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FOR my part I, tho' vers'd in booking,</L>
<L>Still sav'd my carcase from such cooking;</L>
<L>And always slyly shunn'd a trade,</L>
<L>Too trifling as I thought and said;</L>
<L>But at a certain crazy season,</L>
<L>When men have neither sense or reason:</L>
<L>By some confounded misadventure,</L>
<L>I found myself just in it's centre.</L>

And swift to execute the blow,</L>

</LG>

<L>Now I am ask'd a thousand questions,</L>
<L>Of ALEXANDERS and EPHESTIONS;</L>
<L>With fly design to know if I</L>
<L>Am vers'd in GRECIAN history;</L>
<L>And then again my time destroy,</L>
<L>With aukward grace to tell of TROY:</L>
<L>From that huge giant POLYPHEMUS,</L>
<L>Quite down to ROMULVS and REMUS.</L>
<L>Then I'm oblig'd to give them lectures,</L>

<L>Teach him the doctrine of the sphere,</L>

<L>AND there a city dame approaches,</L>
<L>Known by her horsemen, chairs and coaches:</L>
<L>"Sir, here's my son, teach him to speak</L>
<L>The Hebrew, Latin, and the Greek:</L>
<L>And this I half forgot, pray teach</L>
<L>My tender boy—the parts of speech—</L>
<L>But never let this son of me,</L>
<L>Learn that vile thing Astronomy:</L>

<L>O I'm your humble servant ma'am.</L>
<L>There certainly is something, in it—</L>
<L>"Boy, drive the coach off in a minute."</L>
<L>And thus I'm left in street or road,</L>
<L>A laughing stock to half the crowd,</L>
<L>To argue with myself the case,</L>
<L>And prove its being to my face.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A plague I say on such employment,</L>
<L>Where's neither pleasure nor enjoyment:</L>
<L>Whoe'er to such a life is ty'd,</L>

<L>BEHOLD this antique dome by envious time,</L>
<L>Grown crazy, and in ev'ry part decay'd;</L>
<L>Full well, alas, it claims my humble rhyme,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah see the hearth, where once the chearful fire!</L>
<L>Blaz'd high, and warm'd the winter trav'lers toes;</L>
<L>And see the walls, which once did high aspire,</L>
<L>Admit the storms, and ev'ry wind that blows.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In yonder corner, now to ruin gone,</L>
<L>The ancient housewife's curtain'd bed appear'd,</L>
<L>Where she and her man JOHN did sleep alone,</L>
<L>Nor nightly robber, nor the screach owl fear'd.</L>

There did they snore full oft' the whole night out,</L>
<L>Smoking the sable pipe, 'till that did fall,</L>
<L>Rest from their jaws by Somnus' sleepy rout,</L>
<L>And on their faces pour'd its scorched gall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And in the compass of yon' smaller gang,</L>
<L>The swain BATAVIAN once his courtship made,</L>

<L>"And let us for the bridal bed prepare;</L>

<L>My strong, my hearty, and industrious wife."</L>

<L>Thus they—but eating ruin now hath spread</L>
<L>Its wings destructive o'er the antique dome;</L>
<L>The mighty fabrick now is all a shed,</L>
<L>Scarce fit to be the wand'ring beggar's home.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And none but me it's piteous fate lament,</L>
<L>None, none but me o'er it's sad ashes mourn,</L>
