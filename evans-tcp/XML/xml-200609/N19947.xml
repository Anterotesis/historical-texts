<P>THE YORKER'S STRATAGEM; OR BANANA'S WEDDING. A FARCE, IN TWO ACTS. AS PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE IN NEW-YORK, BY THE Old American Company of Comedians, WITH UNIVERSAL APPLAUSE.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author of the following little Piece is sensible of its numerous defects—it was got up in a hurry, and under many disadvanta∣ges. The very flattering marks of approbation, however, with which it was received, together with the pressing importunities of many friends, have led him to suppose that a publication of it would not be unpleasing.</P>
<P>To the generous Patrons of the Drama, and to the worthy Sons of Columbia who feel an in∣terest in the welfare of the American Stage, the <HI>YORKER'S STRATAGEM</HI> is most respectfully de∣dicated: and the Author is not without hopes, that this feeble attempt, defective as it is, will meet an apology from every generous heart for its introduction into the world.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL, Captain, here are we arrived in the West-Indies, the climate for life, luxury and fashion; do you not think I have chose a pretty fancy dress to come ashore in?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Captain.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly, Sir, there are two things which appear very odd to me, and which I own give rise to strange conjectures.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>What are they?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Captain.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the first place, why you should prefer this out-bay, where there are but a few fishing-huts and two or three stores, to your chance of a market at the princi∣pal town; and secondly, your coming ashore in this dis∣guise has something tha appearance of a spy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my dear fellow, to clear your suspicions I will fully acquaint you with my design in coming here, and the story that gave rise to it—It is almost need∣less for me to request your secrecy and assistance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Captain.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may depend on me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>In our conversations about the fair sex, you have frequently heard me dwell with rapture on the vir∣tues and beauty of a young lady with whom I got ac∣quainted when she was at a boarding-school in York.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Captain.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have, Sir, and wish'd to ask you particu∣larly about her, but was afraid it might offend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="026103_0005_0FCF8C9D9D0248E8"/>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her name is Sophia Bellange, a native of this country; her parents are lately dead. 'Tis a letter from her since her arrival here that was the cause of my clos∣ing my affairs at home, and undertaking this journey. She describes her guardian to be avaricious, and totally destitute of principle, constantly employed in every war∣rantable theft that the simplicity or imprudence of his neighbours will permit him to practise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Captain.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, how do you intend to meet him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>With his own weapons, artifice and chicane. You must introduce me as supercargo, a true Yankey, sent out by daddy with a cargo of lumber, hogs and poultry, to make daddy's own son a 'squire. My ap∣parent simplicity will ensure him a gull, and me an op∣portunity of seeing my mistress, and contriving some means to get her and her fortune out of his hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Captain.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what part am I to take in this scheme?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must say as little as possible, appear al∣most as ignorant as myself, and depend on me for in∣structions as we go on. Suppose we call in the landlord and make some enquiry about the old gentleman?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Captain.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think it will be necessary. But are you Jonathan here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>In every place 'till I get into the arms of my mistress.
<STAGE>(Mimicks)</STAGE>
House, house, who keeps house here? Won't that do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Captain.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, very well.</P>

<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Acid.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Acid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you please to want any thing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't you think, Captain, that we two might make out with a little apple toddy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Acid.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is, Sir, you want a bowl of punch, and a slice of pine-apple in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>You be drot, do you think I came all the way from Stony-Town, and not know that apples don't grow on pine-trees, and that punch aint toddy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Acid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg your pardon, Sir, we have no other ap∣ple here except the coushooe.</P>

<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't tell me about your cow shoe, nor your horse shoe, I'll not put up with any of your half laughs, I'll be dur if I do, and that's point blank.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Acid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I wou'd not wish to offend any gentleman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you do think I am a gentleman?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Acid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure you look very like one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, friend, to shew you I don't belie my looks I'll be generous, and treat Nathan hear to a bottle of wine; and do you hear, bring a jug of cool water—this country seems hot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Acid.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE>
Hot enough to sweat your plank and salt fish, or I'm mistaken. Madeira, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Captain.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, to be sure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, an't you a pretty sort of a landlord and don't know that gentlemen drink French wine?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Acid.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE>
Lord! Lord! what an ass you are.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Captain.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you play Jonathan better than I ex∣pected.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis my surest card; ten to one if our land∣lord is not the first to make a report to the old gentleman of the simplicity of his guests.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Captain.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have christen'd me too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes, remember you are Nathan Goslin, and I am Jonathan Norrard.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Acid, <HI>with bottle, glasses, &amp;c.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, now, that's ship-shape, as our mate says. Come, landlord, won't you take a glass? Come, be bold, I don't value a glass of wine a corn-cob, not I. Sit down; it's as cheap sitting as standing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Acid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, you are very polite.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, so our neighbours' daughters tell me; and now, since I've cross'd the seas, I intend to be a great man before I go back to daddy. Pray, friend, do you know one Mr. Fingercash, some place about here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Acid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, he's my neighbour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>They talk in our parts that he buys super-cargoes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="026103_0007_0FCF8C9A23299A28"/>
<SPEAKER>Acid.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE>
He'll buy and sell you if you fall into his clutches. Yes, Sir, he purchases cargoes of all sorts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I think I can suit him to a notch—Pray what sort of a man is he to deal with?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Acid.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to his honesty, I would vouch for it as soon as for my own—He's my particular friend; if you please, Sir, I'll introduce you to him; he is vastly hospitable to strangers: you have never seen him, I presume?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I should not know the man if I was to meet him in my mush; but I'll be bound he knows daddy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Acid.</SPEAKER>
<P>What may his name be, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! do'nt you know he? I did'nt think there was a dog in the parish but knew Old-Caleb at the saw-mill.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Acid.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you please to favour me with his sirname—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>His brother Epram drives more hogs to the market than any five men in our county. The old 'squire used to say that Epram Norrard's word was as good as any man's bond.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Acid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Norrard,
<STAGE>(takes him by the hand)</STAGE>
I am very proud, I assure you, to see you under my roof: how lucky you was in happening to call here: my good friend, make yourself at home, be perfectly easy about every thing; Mr. Fingercash and I will take a pleasure in get∣ting your cargo off your hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not the least doubt of that.
<STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE>
But how the plague did you make out to know my name? I'll swear you must be a witch.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Acid.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Sir, I am not unacquainted with the fame and respectability of your family. Your own cha∣racter is now perfectly known to me, and you may rest satisfied I shall make it my study to profit by so valuable an acquaintance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not so much as you imagine.
<STAGE>(Aside)</STAGE>
Then you think I may do in this country?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Acid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Undoubtedly, my dear friend; come along with me, and I'll put you in a way of doing for your∣self in a very little time. Oh you cursed jack-ass!</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fingercash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, what's this business?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fingercash.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is simply this; we have both agreed not to give our daughter a farthing of portion, till our death, and as the young fellows now a days will not take a girl without a fortune, I think it adviseable to strike with Mrs. Banana's proposal of a match between our daughter and her son: he has got a fine estate, and however defective he may be with regard to education, and that bauble sentiment, it will be amply made up for by his cash and canefields.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fingercash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, husband, do as you will.

<P>Something is in the wind; Acid is always on the look-out; quick in scent, sure of his game. Go, go wise, break the match to your young pullet, and I'll go and pluck the Yankey geese.</P>
</SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stop, friend, few words are best; but if you go to that, daddy won't turn his back on any man in our parts, from a cedar shingle to a two-inch plank, and I can prove it down right point blank upon the nail.</P>

<P>Any good puncheon staves?</P>

<P>Yes, the 'squire of our town did ship a few casks of choice salt fish, I'm a sheep's-head if there is better between this and Cape-Cod. Smell that.
<STAGE>(Knocks the fish against his nose.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fingercash.</SPEAKER>
<P>It smells well; but that's a rough manner of producing your sample.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I don't make many compliments, not I; the plain thing is the plain thing, and so sister told Nicka∣damus, when she broke his face last husking time.</P>

<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my angel, I read my welcome in those beauteous eyes, true to the dictates of a heart where love and candour only dwell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Bellange.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, my Amant! what have I not suf∣fered since the sad event that drew me from you!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>My soul felt all your anguish; by the strong power of sympathetic love I shared in all your sorrows, and now am come to sooth the sad remembrance, to be your friend, your father, and your —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Bellange.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know the other title you would claim, but am afraid there is an insurmountable obstacle in your way to that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>In surmountable, Madam, did you say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Bellange.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why do you start? you know my heart is only yours, but fortune —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, what of fortune?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Bellange.</SPEAKER>
<P>Makes it —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>What?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Bellange.</SPEAKER>
<P>Impossible I can be yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>And are my flattering hopes thus blasted? Have I then quit my home in expectation of exalted bliss, to meet the most aggravating of disappointments?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Bellange.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are in an error—do not give way to the impetuosity of your temper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heavens, Madam! is it possible I could with patience meet such an unexpected reception?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Bellange.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sure you do not doubt my sincerity?</P>

<PB N="14" REF="026103_0013_0FCFAD56A9211168"/>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never did till you began to speak of obstacles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Bellange.</SPEAKER>
<P>But do you know what they are?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are acquainted with them, and that I suppose is sufficient.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Bellange.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will you but hear me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, to make me more distracted than I am?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Bellange.</SPEAKER>
<P>This, Sir, is a specimen of your tem∣per I never thought of seeing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a trial I thought it beyond the power of fortune to put it to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, I see there is a misunderstanding be∣tween you, and as it is a relation of mine that is the cause of it, I'll endeavour to clear it up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>A brother, I presume? Cursed fortune!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, it is my father, without whose con∣sent she cannot give away her hand; and her fortune, (which altho' he says is small) has too many charms for him to resign in a hurry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! my Sophia, and is that the only bar that can impede my happiness?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Bellange.</SPEAKER>
<P>The sole one; and do you not think the want of fortune is a strong one?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>By heaven if there was any circumstance on earth could make me love you more, it would be to la∣bour against difficulties to make you happy; but surely my fortune, and abilities in business, are by no means so despicable as to take away from my felicity with the woman that could return my love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Bellange.</SPEAKER>
<P>And where is the woman that would not make a return to such a generous heart? Take then my hand, and let your counsel guide my will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I am completely happy; secure in your affections, if I even fail in procuring the old gentleman's consent I shall possess a treasure which, in my estimation, is richer than all these Indies can bestow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louisa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, please to lay aside your love and sentiment for a period that I hope is not far off, and re-assume your character of Jonathan, which you person∣ate

so well; a thought has struck me, that with the assist∣ance of a dying swain (who I will this moment intro∣duce you to) we may all of us be enabled to set sail for your country, where Virtue gives distinction, Industry wealth; and where, like Majesty Divine, the hand that can deal thunder to usurping foes, distributes the bles∣sings of Liberty and Concord to his fellow citizens, by the justice and wisdom of his laws.</P>

<P>Yes, faith, but the Frenchman's' intrigue crowns all; that secret will command what terms I please for myself, and Ledger too I hope. He has wrote to the Governor on the tyranny of the old gentleman's forcing his daughter to a preposterous match with Bana∣na,

<SPEAKER>Mr. Fingercash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hey day! in the name of wonder, who are you, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>My name is Amant, a favoured admirer of this lady's, whose fortune I now demand; my right of claim to it being your and her consent to our union.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Fingercash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, this makes good the old saying, that a true bred Yankey is a match for the devil:—But you'll find yourself mistaken in her fortune—I have large demands against the estate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>How justly founded my friend Ledger can explain—You see I'm a match for you every way— Remember you said I was the boy for your purpose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Governor.</SPEAKER>
<P>You find, Sir, from your ungovernable de∣sire of riches, you not only put people upon their guard against you, but oblige them to descend to the lowest arts, to defeat you in your villainy. To such a degrad∣ing state of infamy did you lower yourself, that you made even your wife and child abhor you as a monster that knew no distinction of either appetite or sentiment: that abhorrence gave rise to inconstancy in the one, and disobedience in the other. The only atonement you can now make for your past errors, is to return to the paths of honour and honesty, and by your endeavours to make your family happy, be reinstated in their loves.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Fingercash.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your words are backed with truth and sound reason, and I'm become their convert. I humbly beg pardon for the trouble I have given you: But if you and this good company will bury in oblivion my past errors, and those of the YORKER'S STRATAGEM, I shall for the future only exist in meriting your—no—
