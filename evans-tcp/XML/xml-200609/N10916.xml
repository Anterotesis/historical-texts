To the INHABITANTS of ANNE-ARUNDEL county.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU are requested to meet at the city of Annapolis, on Monday the 16th instant, to nominate deputies to attend, on behalf of this county, at the next provincial con∣vention, and to chuse a committee of observation; permit me to offer to your con∣sideration, the reasons, which induce me to solicit your attendance on that day. The incon∣venience arising from the season of the year, I am satisfied, will not prevent you, if convin∣ced, that your duty to your country requires your attendance. You have always distinguished <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>selve<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> cause of liberty, and never been exceeded by any county, in zeal and public spirit.</P>
<P>Your liberty and happiness, and that of your posterity, depend on the event of the pre∣sent struggle with the British ministry: they seem determined to make you slaves, you are resolved to be free: the American congress has pointed out the means of preserving free∣dom: a suspension of your trade;—and the necessary preparations to enable you to repel force by force, if that should be employed to subvert your rights and liberties: these are the means recommended by the united opinion and advice of America. The freedom of mil∣lions, the political salvation of all British America, can only be secured by executing with fi∣delity and resolution the advice of the congress.</P>
<P>A strict compliance with the association and resolves of our late provincial convention, d∣pends in great measure on a prudent and wise choice of your committee of observation: I would recommend it to consist of a considerable number of gentlemen of the best understand∣ing, fortune, and influence in the county, without any regard to profession, religion, or resi∣dence; men able to speak your sense on any question, and to whose resolutions you would wish to give that weight, which their utility, and the public good might require.</P>
<P>The appointment of deputies, to represent this county, at the next convention, in April; which will not be held, if American grievances should in the mean time be redressed, appears to me of the greatest consequence, and to demand your most deliberate attention: If the British ministry should continue deaf to our complaints, and to the voice of reason, of policy, and justice, and and should determine to enforce, at all events, its arbitrary decrees, how dreadful would be our situation, in the midst of all the horrors and calamities of civil war! We scorn, we reject with contempt, the base humiliating conditions of slavery—We are determined to resist even unto death, to save our country, or bravely perish in her ruins. If American griev∣ances should not be redressed (and I fear they will not) questions of such a magnitude and difficulty <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> arise, as to require the united wisdom, knowledge, and fortitude of this province. Your virtue will then be put to a severe trial—Consider then with attention, the nature and importance of the trust, and to whom you delegate your power at this very critical and alarming crisis of your affairs.—You never were called on to exercise your great constitutional right of electing your representatives, at a time which required more judgment in your choice. I would recommend but one <HI>TEST—an honest man with ability and resolu∣tion.</HI>—</P>
<P>"The Congress thought themselves bound in duty to observe to the colonies, that the schemes agitated against them had been so conducted as to render it prudent, <HI>that they should extend their views to the most unhappy events, and be in all respects prepared for every contingency.</HI>" The necessary means of preparation were left to each province, as best acquainted with their own peculiar circumstances.—Your deputies met in provincial convention were of opinion, that a well regulated militia is the natural strength and only stable security of a free government, and <HI>unanimously</HI> recommended to the freemen of this province to form themselves into companies, chuse their officers, learn the military exercise, be pro∣vided with arms and ammunition, in readiness to act on any emergency, and to raise money for the purchase of arms and ammunition: They entreated, they conjured every man by his duty to God, his country, and his posterity, cordially to unite in defence of our common rights and liberties. I want no argument to convince me of the immediate necessity of putting this province in a posture of defence. If any one should object to the measure, I would answer, THE CONGRESS ADVISED IT:—<HI>The deputies of all the counties of this province unanimously recommended it</HI>: The first with me is sufficient, the latter conclusive: The deputies were gentlemen of the first fortunes, ability, and knowledge, well acquainted with our circumstances, and undoubtedly spoke the sense of the whole province. The private opinions of some few indi∣viduals, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> respectable for integrity of character, soundness of judgement, and their at∣tachment to the cause of America, ought to have little weight in opposition to the advice of the continental congress, and the recommendation of your own provincial convention.</P>
<P>I have not the least doubt that this county will inviolably observe and execute the associa∣tion, and the resolves of the province: I question not but a very great majority of you will form yourselves into a militia, and liberally contribute for the purchase of arms and ammuni∣tion. Every man is bound to serve his country; all are obliged, or none. Every man is bound to contribute his endeavours to advance and secure the general good. This county is called
<PB REF="013816_0002_0F91EC5B0D11DEF8"/>
on by the province to raise £. 866, for the purchase of arms and ammunition. Every man then in this county is bound to contribute in some proportion to the property which he holds, and the more his property is worth, the more he ought to pay for the security of it. But there are a few among you (I rejoice but a few) who, in this time of public danger and cala∣mity, separate themselves from their country, and though blessed with very ample fortunes, refuse, or decline, to contribute any part thereof, to the support of the public cause, or to unite in defence of our common rights and liberties.—Our convention in June recommended contributions for the support of our distressed brethren in Boston; not one farth<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> was given by the same gentlemen; a congress was deemed proper to collect the sense of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> same persons did not contribute to the support of your delegates: the congress <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the colonies to arm in defence of their liberties; your late convention <HI>unanimously</HI> recommended a militia, and subscriptions to raise money for the purchase of arms and ammunition; the same men, persevering in the same line of conduct, have declined to comply with either of the requisitions; they withdraw their persons and their fortunes from the service of their country: but they are as much interested, and have as deep a stake to lose as any other men in the province; they, and their posterity are to enjoy, with you, all advantages arising from the success of the present contest with Great-Britain; they must be involved with you in all the consequences of a slavish subjection; liberty procured by you will be equally enjoyed by them; slavery fixed on you will be equally intailed on them and their posterity.—If such indeed was their situation, it would be difficult to account for their conduct.—In truth, if Ame∣rica succeeds, they will be benefitted as much as any men in the province, without contributing any part of their property, without any risque of forfeitures, and with safety to their persons; their present behaviour may entitle them to the protection of the ministry. If we fail, they will pos∣sess their estates, and enjoy their offices; promotion may reward their present conduct, and their resentment may be gratified by seeing some of your best and firmest friends, executed as re∣bels and traitors.—Such is the double, crafty, and, in their opinion, secure game played by some few among you. Place, therefore, no confidence in such men, view them as foes to the rights of British America, let their names be published to the world, that they may be uni∣versally contemned, as the enemies of American liberty; let them be the object of your con∣tempt, but let them not feel the force of your resentment.</P>
<P>I cannot conclude without once more earnestly requesting a full meeting of the county: numbers will command respect, and give weight to your resolutions.</P>
