<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>A REVISAL and correction of "E∣rastus," literally translated by a native of Germany, lately arrived in Pennsyl∣vania, gave rise to the following piece. The happy simplicity of the German original, written in one act by the ce∣lebrated Gesner, suggested an enlarge∣ment of the plan. A new character is added, songs are introduced, and the dialogue so modelled, as to be ren∣dered (it is presumed) pleasing to an American ear.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="022638_0004_0FBA8F2350205B60"/>Those, who understand the German and English languages, will, on com∣paring the two pieces, readily perceive the difference between them. To their candor, and to the indulgence of the public, "the RECONCILIATION, &amp;c." is submited.</P>

<P>MERCY on me! what is become of Simon? Some bad accident or other has happened to the poor, dear fellow. What shall we do, if he should never return? No victuals in the house; no messenger to go for any, and little, very little mo∣ney remaining. I never suspected, when I turn∣ed cook, that things would come to this pass. Our family at times might as well have a coach with a fifth wheel to it, as a cook. Now and then we get a comfortable meal; now and then, I say. But in general we lead the life of a dog—hunger and ease.—False-hearted Simon! thou worst of cannibals! thus to desert master and mistress, our promising young gentleman, and thy own Debby—The fellow is certainly taking his swing in some tavern or other, drinking, and gormandizing; or perhaps making love to some draggled-tail'd—But I'll match him; I'll match him.</P>

<P>Exposed to the chilling damps of the morning, and to the scorching rays of the noon-day sun, I have unceasingly wandered in pursuit of food for my family—but in vain. The distresses of my mind affect my bodily faculties. My once uner∣ring hands have forgot their office. The birds ho∣ver over my head, as if unapprehensive of my gun, whilst the deer, no longer timid, feed in securi∣ty, and seem to defy my feeble efforts. Once more let me enter my cottage; the abode—O Heaven!—the abode of innocence and afflic∣tion.</P>

<P>Incomparable woman! how piously resigned to, the will of Heaven! Alone, she indulges in the extreme of sorrow; but at my approach the smiles of conjugal affection add new lustre to her charms. Joy seems to triumph on her countenance, lest grief should lour on mine. The wife is studious to cheer the bosom of her desponding husband, whilst the woman and the mother feels internally all the horrors of her situation. Such virtue is entitled to reward. But as for me, O! that dis∣tress were my lot only!—that I alone were doom∣ed to misery—provided that she and my son were happy! Our poverty increases. Age, accelerated by grief and sickness, advances with rapid strides. My money is nearly exhausted; and alas! I have no credit. Deserted by my father, from whom can
<PB N="13" REF="022638_0010_0FB9B6911AF0A6F8"/>
I expect relief? The exertions of my industry have been destroyed by the late storm. Twelve years have elapsed, since I entreated forgiveness from my father in a letter fraught with filial con∣trition. Alas! can the fault, which I have com∣mitted, excuse his severity? Detesting treachery towards a woman, who united herself to me in consequence of my most solemn promises, I have discharged the duty of a man of honour, although in so doing I acted contrary to his commands. Not all the glare of riches, not all the pride of dominion, could have soothed the horrors of my mind, had I consigned to obloquy and disgrace a woman, who justly lays claim to universal esteem. But let me not despond. Nature will as∣sert her rights, and the heart of my father must at length relent. My son approaches! Gracious Heaven! to what misery may he not be exposed! I will conceal my sorrow, and assume the sem∣blance of contentment, whilst anguish preys upon my heart. Hitherto secluded from the world, his conversation is necessarily puerile, but his heart, I trust, is good, and his understanding not defective.</P>

<P>Your self-reproaches are injurious to my love. Most solemnly I declare, that the serenity of my countenance is the true picture of the tranquility of my heart. Whilst possessed of you, I am tru∣ly happy. Bereft of you, no earthly considerati∣on could afford me any comfort.</P>

<SPEAKER>AMELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Discontent and grief are ever strangers to my bosom, 'till I observe, that they disturb your qui∣et. Reflect on those, whose distresses are by far greater than ours. Shall we, who boast the bless∣ings of education, suffer by a comparison with such? As we know more than they, let our know∣ledge teach us greater resignation.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>They more unhappy than we!—Less fortunate than a bird of prey, I have in vain this after∣noon traversed those mountains in pursuit of game. As I departed, I return—utterly unprovided. My own sufferings I could bear, especially as your resignation furnishes a bright example.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMELIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Best of husbands! why should you give way to despondence, since the extremity of distress is as yet at a distance? Fruits at least we may reason∣ably expect from our son at his return. But should

<P>If he follows virtue, she will conduct him to happiness.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>The prospect, at least with regard to this world, is gloomy. Few are the comforts, which virtue communicates to those who are oppressed by pover∣ty. Not only his immediate wants, but his future destiny excite apprehension. Doomed to pover∣ty, how fortunate will he be, should he remain uninfected by the vices of the outcasts of society. O my father! may thy heart be a stranger to such sorrow, as I now experience, even should thy offspring, unpitied and unknown, be compel∣led to beg a morsel of bread at thy door.</P>

I'll be hanged, if there is any crime at all in it. Yet— I do not know how it happens—I tremble in eve∣ry limb, as if I deserved to be hanged indeed. I would not for the world old Deborah should see me. She would swear the gallows was in my face.
<STAGE>(Taking a purse out of his pocket.)</STAGE>
Here is the ri∣no!—What charming music it makes in the old green purse! This will put Debby in tune, and make her pot boil merrily for some weeks at least. But it was obtained unjustly—and on the high-way too—if I had tricked a man out of it in the way of a bargain, there would have been no harm done— But to act so barefacedly!—Simon! you old knave! you will certainly pay for this one day or another. Good Mr. Conscience! forgive me for this time—it is my first offence—and I will never do so any more. You pull an honest fellow's heart∣strings so severely, that I vow and protest, it is better to die peaceably with hunger, than to live in luxury after having once offended you. It is very true, that, because our worthy family are in a starving condition, I did presume to ask a traveller—perhaps rather in a peremptory style—for
<PB N="23" REF="022638_0020_0FB9B6B0AF8DF728"/>
a trifle, of which he can be in no great want. He will soon have recourse to his bureau, which will make him ample amends for the pityful sum I bor∣rowed from him. But after all is it not a burning shame, that the rich should wallow in excess, whilst my worthy master, his charming Amelia, the young gentleman, their son; and honest Si∣mon, not forgetting greasy Deborah—are ready at times to perish with hunger in these regions of misery? I say, it is a scandalous thing; and who dares say to tne contrary?—O Lud! O Lud!— I hear somebody coming.—No—What a simple∣ton I am!—Simon! take heart; you have given proofs of courage; you must now display your wisdom. But, as I hate to be cross-questioned, let me think on what I may safely say.—Honest Simon! stick to the truth.—You old fool! do you mean to tie the rope about your own neck?—A hard tax upon my veracity!—I'll tell him—what? That will never do—worse, and worse, you block-head!—I am at my wits ends. I'll tell him—yes— this will do; now I have it. I'll tell him, that a great man, whom I do not know, met me—I have forgot where—and asked me, if I was yet in Mr. George Wilson's service; told me, that he had heard lately of his distressed circumstances; piti∣ed him much—and a great deal more to the same purpose—and so—this good, worthy gentleman— Who is coming?—Only Mr. William—I am so stinted in time, that I fear I shall make but a sor∣ry piece of work of it. Whilst I am thinking of a plausible story, I will trifle away a minute or two with this over-grown boy, who knows no more of the world, than if he did not belong to it.—Honest Simon, I fear after all, you will turn out but a pitiful liar, and a paltry politician.</P>

<SPEAKER>WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>This news, Simon! will be of great comfort to father and mother. Till you came, we had not a morsel in the house. To-day, I saw mother in tears, as she was at work. She did not see me, but she sighed and wept in such a manner, that I could not help weeping too. As she turned round, she perceived me, and then wiped her eyes, be∣cause she did not wish I should see her tears; but I saw them plain enough. Simon! pray, tell
<PB N="25" REF="022638_0022_0FB9B6B45A16A278"/>
me what makes father and mother weep so much. It always makes me sad to see them so sorrowful.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIMON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am inclined to think, it is because they are poor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>They poor! Our neighbours in the mountains may be poor; but that is not our case, I am certain.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>If we can be said to be poor at all, it is but for a little while. This morning we were in a sad condition; but now we have victuals enough, and some to spare.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIMON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Charming youth! excellent reasoning!
<STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE>
I fancy, Mr. William, you will be a philosopher— ha! ha! ha!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>What makes you so merry, Simon? Those, I think, who suffer no want, cannot be said to be poor. We have enough for to-day, and to-mor∣row, and next day too.</P>

<P>But, Simon! if we are poor, how do the rich live?</P>

<P>Why, in abundance to be sure; they have more than they know what to do with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>But of what use is it to them to have too much?</P>

<P>No improper question!—Yet these people are still grasping after more riches, and are often more unhappy than the poor.</P>

<SPEAKER>WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is very extraordinary—Do they never share with the poor?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIMON.</SPEAKER>
<P>They share with the poor!—not they truly; they would rather take from the poor what little they have, and add it to their own monstrous heaps.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can this be possible?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIMON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very possible, I assure you; and what is more, it is very common.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Simon! you certainly wish to deceive me. Don't you know you must never tell a fib?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIMON.</SPEAKER>
<P>A fib!—I never told a greater truth in my life. The town swarms with such sort of gentry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>For my part, if I could afford it, I would do as father and mother do, and share with the poor. I can't tell how it happens, but joy makes me cry, whenever a poor body thanks us and prays to God to bless us for any trifle, which we can well enough spare.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIMON.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is because you are young, and tender-hearted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why should I not be always tender-hearted?</P>

<P>Perhaps you may— <STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE> unless you take after the old rogue, your grand-father.</P>

<P>Worthy creature! Now may I indulge the plea∣sing hope of being enabled to reward his services. The letter is begun, and shall be finished this e∣vening. How tormenting is doubt! how enchant∣ing is hope! My rapture will exceed all bounds, should the answer to it speak the language of pa∣ternal love.

answer no good purpose; and, as he has hitherto been educated in extreme simplicity, his ignorance of the world, although he is not deficient in natu∣ral good sense, might expose him to irreparable evils.

<P>What! did you take it by force?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIMON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be patient, Sir—and I shall relate to you eve∣ry circumstance of the affair.—In crossing those solitary mountains on my return to our dreary abode, casting my eyes towards the city, I be∣held those lofty mansions, whose roofs are lost in the clouds; and called to mind the debaucheries of their owners, who live as if fortune were at their beck; lavishing their ill-gotten wealth in a most scandalous manner, whilst their unhappy fel∣low-creatures are suffered to perish at their doors, unpitied and even despised.</P>

<PB N="35" REF="022638_0032_0FB9B6D265305ED8"/>
<SPEAKER>SIMON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grew angry—very angry, Sir—when I recol∣lected, that such should engross the good things of the world, whilst the finest, the wisest, and the most virtuous man on earth—whom, at present, I shall not presume to name—together with the best, and most accomplished of her sex—meaning your lady, Sir—should live in want and misery.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>A truce with compliments—proceed—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIMON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I took a survey of our deplorable situation, and was reminded by an importunate, but faithful, mo∣nitor near my heart—I mean, Sir, my stomach— that we were often without a morsel of bread in the house, whilst many an idle profligate fellow— not worthy to clean your honor's shoes—is living in a palace in riot and profusion, and often risques on a single card more money than a so∣ber pains-taking labourer can earn all his life. Your honour knows I tell nothing but the truth. They storm at a poor man worse than a mercena∣ry magistrate, when asked for a penny by the old, the lame, or the blind. Your honour also knows, when they want to trick an innocent mai∣den out of her virtue, they spend more money, than would suffice to fill the bellies of a large fa∣mily for a twelvemonth.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are in a moralizing humour—but go on—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIMON.</SPEAKER>
<P>With these thoughts in my head, I could not help losing my temper. Is it right, says I—is it right that such knaves should possess almost all the gifts of nature, in which their fellow-creatures ought to share? Shall one man waste what would be enough for thousands? My heart ready to
<PB N="36" REF="022638_0033_0FB9B6D3F764AA00"/>
break, I took up my burthen, and jogging on in a very bad humour saw a well dressed man in a cross-road on horse-back, advancing towards me. Suppose, thought I on a sudden, I should fright∣en this fine spark into a little charity? He might very well share with me his superfluities; and where there is no harm done—there can be no injury received. In this manner I reasoned.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WILSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>An acute logician!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIMON.</SPEAKER>
<P>Courage told me to accost him boldly; but conscience wanted to make a coward of me. Af∣ter some altercation, I compromised the matter between them in this manner. One half of his money, says I to courage, swearing like a troop∣er, he shall give me. The other half, whispered I to conscience, he may keep. I want the means of subsistence, not wealth; and it is a great pity, so many worthy people—including myself—should perish with hunger.</P>

<P>I then threw my bundle amongst the bushes, and felt—as the man on horse-back approached me—I can't tell you how I felt. At one time I was as bold as a lion, and then again I trembled like a hare. "Please to stop a little," cried I, taking hold of the bridle with my left hand, whilst I <HI>accidentally</HI> flourished my cudgel with my right; "be so kind as to lend me half of your money; and do not keep me long waiting, for I am in a confounded hurry. My friends expect me." His courage was certainly less than mine; otherwise he would have seen my confusion and tremor, as I held the bridle. In short he threw down this

old green purse. I took it into the wood, and after some time, seemed as if just awaking from a dream.—Now, Sir, if you will condescend to consider all the circumstances of this affair, I humbly presume you will by no means condemn honest Simon to the gallows.</P>

<P>I am—as you see, Sir—overwhelmed with shame and sorrow. Be pleased to receive what desperati∣on and the dread of starving compelled me to take from you. Alas! Sir, I was driven to undertake this business, by no means suited to my talents, by my master—I mean, Sir—by my master's dis∣tresses, and those of his family. Heaven, I hope, as well as your worship, will pardon me for an action, which I abhor in my heart. Here is

<P>I have misconceived, Sir, your character. Pardon my error. I now find, that you have eve∣ry claim to compassion and relief. Oblige me in accepting this trifle. Nay, Sir—I am in earnest. A larger sum should be at your service; but a traveller is seldom overburthened with money.</P>

<P>How enviable is your situation! I am rich, ve∣ry rich; yet would I part with all my possessions in exchange for tranquility of mind.

<P>You are yet young. Listen to the advice of an old man, who counsels you to lay up in your youth the treasure of a good conscience, as the chief comfort of your age.
