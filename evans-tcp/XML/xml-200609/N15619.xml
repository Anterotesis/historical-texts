<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IMPROVEMENT in Elocution, for a select number of students, at a public school, was one principal design of the author, when he began the following piece.—How far he succeeded in that design, must be left to those who are ac∣quainted with the circumstances to judge—And how far he may now succeed in gaining the approbation of the public, time must determine.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Doubtless, those who are professed enemies to the Drama, in whatever garb it may appear, if they pay any attention to this, will wholly condemn it;—and perhaps, those who are friendly to performances of the kind, and judges of their merit, not without reason, will do the same.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Should the morose, uncandid Critic, who subsists on the faults, and follies of others, be at leisure, and not think this piece be∣neath his notice, he may on a slight examination, find it a very proper, and salutary morsel, just to alleviate the cravings of his voracious appetite, till he can meet with something more sub∣stantial to feed upon.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The author's most sanguine hopes, have never led him to expect that this performance would escape the attack of the Critic, any other way, than by his supposing it unworthy his notice, and therefore turning his exertions to some other perfor∣mances of more merit.</HI></P>
<P><HI>'Tis allowed that the motives of Theatrical performances, ought, by striking representations, to hold up Virtue, or vir∣tuous actions, in a beautiful point of light—and, to represent Vice in its most odious colours, and vicious actions meeting condign punishment:—So far as these motives, or the effects of them are inverted, 'tis generally allowed that performances of this kind become detrimental. How far this rule is adherea to in the following pages, must be determined by the judgment of those who peruse them.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="019922_0003_0FAD44C306145DB0"/>
<HI>The subject is what every person, in the United States, ar∣rived to years of understanding, is well acquainted with; and a subject, in which every one, in the time the transactions referred to took place, thought themselves deeply interested.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It will perhaps be said, that a performance of this kind if ever proper and suitable, would have been much more so, just at the close of the war, when these matters were fresh in the minds of all; but that now, there is no propriety in it, since other matters must necessarily have occupied the minds of peo∣ple; while the former, are almost obliterated.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This objection, if it be one, was a principal motive which induced the author to publish the piece.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It is well known that the estimate we set on what we possess, is in a great measure proportion'd to the arduous exer∣tions we have made use of in obtaining it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If a man by a perilous undertaking, and the most painful struggles, at the risque of his life and property, has obtained a valuable prize, so long at least, as the danger to which he was exposed, and the earnest efforts he made in the acquisition are fresh in his memory, we may be sure he will carefully preserve and defend it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ought we not to esteem most sacredly, that freedom and in∣dependence secur'd to us by the late important revolution?—Ought we ever to forget those arduous, those bloody struggles we endured in that dangerous contest?—a contest in which thousands of our dear friends yielded up their lives on the san∣guine plains. And shall we, who are enjoying the blessings for which they fought 'till their last breath, forget to celebrate those transactions?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ought we not, on the other hand, ever to bear them on our minds, and endeavour to impress on the minds of the rising generation, the inestimable value of the liberties they possess, and the dangerous struggles their predecessors endured to secure to them those invaluable blessings?</HI></P>
<P><HI>These considerations, with that of the improvement of youth
<PB N="5" REF="019922_0004_0FAD44C444B82CF8"/>
in Elocution, first induced the author to choose this subject, and have now induced him to present this little performance to the public.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He is sensible that he has not pursued the common mode of procedure in Theatrical performances—nor was that his in∣tention:—'Tis hoped however, that the candid will over-look many imperfections, when they consider the great difficulty of bringing a subject so copious and extensive, into the narrow limits necessary for a performance of this kind.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The real characters here represented under fictitious names, are left for the readers to apply.—Many important trans∣actions during the war, are wholly omitted, and only some, and those very few of the most important, just glanced at:—Had this not been the case, the piece would have swelled far beyond the size of a common pamphlet,—which was not intended.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To conclude this preface, already much too long;—the piece, some what singular of its kind, and doubtless containing many inaccuracies, is now, with a solicitation of candour, pre∣sented to the public, by one who will ever esteem it his duty, and highest happiness to promote the welfare of his country.</HI></P>

<L>FROM regions long unknown, from pathless wilds</L>

<L>I come: long hid from every eye, save those</L>

<L>Nature fix'd upon me.—</L>
<L>No chearing symphony of harp or song</L>

<L>No friendly intercourse e'er taught my heart</L>
<L>The gentle sigh of sympathy, or wak'd</L>
<L>The tender passions of my soul:—</L>
<L>Nor did bright science, with her chearing beams,</L>
<L>Nor, education point the way to bliss:</L>
<L>But to the rough savage destin'd,</L>
<L>Long time in gloomy silence I remain'd:</L>
<L>In vain the genial sun roll'd through the skies,</L>
<L>Or gentle showers refresh'd the fertile glebe,</L>
<L>Heaven's bounties unimprov'd were lavish thrown,</L>

<L>That since Columbia, now so much enlarg'd,</L>
<L>By recent conquest, and extent of bounds,</L>
<L>Be somewhat check'd—</L>

<L>Remind her of the vast expence of blood,</L>

And treasure, which Britannia has lost,</L>

<L>Has she not shown her loyalty and valour,</L>
<L>Most conspicuous, in the late unhappy</L>

For my single self, I must declare,</L>
<L>I've ever thought Columbia loyal.—</L>

<LG>
<L>As for coercive measures, which my lord</L>
<L>Was pleas'd to mention,—</L>
<L>I shudder at the thought!—'Tis big with</L>
<L>Horror and destruction!—</L>
<L>Too well Columbia knows the worth of freedom,</L>
<L>Tamely to resign it.—</L>
<L>If by coercive measures his lordship means,</L>
<L>To tear from her by force, those sacred rights,</L>
<L>Which heaven has given, and great Britannia</L>
<L>Has acknowledg'd hers—Be cautious—</L>
<L>I think his lordship would do well to prove</L>

<L>Before he urge their execution.—</L>

<LG>
<L>Columbia truly wears the specious</L>
<L>Face of loyalty, and well she may,</L>

<L>But, my lords, she cherishes the</L>

<L>She secretly aspires to break the league</L>

<L>Submit to what?—to just and wholesome laws?</L>
<L>No, my lords, to laws repugnant to the rights</L>

At this important Crisis for Columbia:—</L>
<L>We think it absolutely right and just;</L>
<L>And what will best promote her interest,</L>
<L>That she should wholly separate from Britannia,—</L>
<L>And openly declare herself entirely free</L>
<L>From all relation, and connexion with the parent state.</L>
<L>Has not Britannia already forfeited</L>

<L>She has—and may she never more obtain it.—</L>

<L>But pray, Arator, can we be supported</L>
