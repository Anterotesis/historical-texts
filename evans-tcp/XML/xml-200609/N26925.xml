<P>THE following production is one of my favorite children; it speaks to the heart, and without ornament, or personal beauty, is recommended by all the chaste virtues, and interesting attributes, of the most favored mortal.</P>
<P>I know not any individual, to whom a model of conjugal excellence, of refined understanding, and at∣tractive accomplishments, can with more propriety be devoted, than to the confided friend, the cultivated companion, the amiable partner, of a character, in which <HI>America</HI> glories, and whom the world venerates.</P>
<P>Yet the writer of these pages supplicates no patron∣age, and solicits no support, except the flattery of your esteem, the encouragement of your approbation; and is less influenced by the benefit she may derive, than by the emulation she feels, in expressing the high re∣spect and admiration, with which she has the honor to consider herself</P>

<HEAD>Advertisement.</HEAD>
<P>IF in a former publication the Author of these pages has attempted to portray the sublime Virtues of Nature—with more solicitude, though with less encour∣agement, she ventures on the present occasion to sup∣port, by a brilliant example, that the higher grades of civilized Society are no less productive of the pre-eminent qualities of fidelity and magnanimity, than the unspoiled and uncultivated communities of the forest.</P>
<P>The subject, founded upon a pathetic occurrence of the American Revolution, is principally selected from a little book, containing letters of General Burgoyne: deeply affected by the interesting recital, the Author has not de∣spaired of inspiring the same sympathy in others; and, under that impression, again presumes to appear before the public tribunal.</P>
<P>The leading features of the following sketch are literally drawn agreeably to the few characteristic outlines, which could be obtained; and the ornaments of Poetry have added but little to the description of a patient, persevering, <HI>fortitude,</HI> which, in displaying the individual, ennobles the whole species.</P>

<L>LET the proud Bard of ancient virtue tell,</L>
<L>How <HI>Arria</HI> lived, and <HI>Laodonia</HI> <SUP>a</SUP> fell;</L>
<L>How the fair queen,<SUP>b</SUP> whom asian realms adored,</L>
<L>In her own breast ensbrined her lifeless lord,</L>
<L>On his lost form with daily fondness fed,</L>
<L>And mix'd her breathing relics with the dead;</L>

<L>Adventurous beauty, love's inspiring flame,</L>
<L>Beyond the storied page of fabling fame.</L>

<L>HARRIET, the titled grace of Britain's shore,</L>
<L>A high-born nymph in lordly nuptials bore,</L>
<L>Her form, by nature's cunning hand array'd,</L>
<L>Each blending beauty of her soul portray'd,</L>
<L>The modest blush, the genius-speaking eye,</L>
<L>The thrilling smile of blest benignity,</L>
<L>Where chaste, attractive, elegance combined</L>
<L>A cherub's softness with an angel's mind;</L>
<L>'Twas hers adown the graceful dance to glide,</L>
<L>Light as the buoyant swan, that skims the tide,</L>
<L>O'er the high harp her polish'd fingers fling,</L>
<L>And touch to eloquence the speaking string,</L>
<L>With liquid throat to pour the lover's pain</L>
<L>In the sweet warble of <HI>Italia</HI>'s strain;</L>
<L>Beneath her magic pencil's forming wand</L>
<L>New villas rise, and greener woods expand,</L>
<L>While to her tutor'd rhetoric was given</L>

<L>Hers was the power, in prosperous fortune blest,</L>
<L>To calm the cares, that rend the widow's breast,</L>
<L>To feed pale want, repining grief to cheer,</L>

<L>Such <HI>Harriet</HI> was—by polish'd care refined,—</L>
<L>Her form the herald of her nobler mind,</L>
<L>At the dread hour, when angry fate unfurl'd</L>
<L>War's crimson standard round the <HI>Younger World;</HI></L>
<L>Ere the train'd warriors of the sea-girt plain</L>
<L>Left their loved home to plough the western main,</L>

<L>The noblest, bravest, of <HI>Britannia</HI>'s blood;</L>
<L>While many a peer, and many a beauteous dame,</L>

<L>But chiefly his, who, foremost of the train,</L>
<L>Led his <HI>tall hundreds</HI><SUP>c</SUP> o'er the portion'd plain,</L>
<L>ACKLAND, whose brow the blazing helmet bears,</L>
<L>And seems <HI>Apollo</HI> in the garb of <HI>Mars,</HI></L>
<L>To <HI>Harriet</HI> seems all, that her dazzled view</L>
<L>In the bright hour of picturing fancy drew.—</L>
<L>With troubled transport, and disorder'd charms,</L>
<L>The fluttering voice its kindred heart alarms,</L>
<L>Through the fair frame betrays the latent fire,</L>
<L>Each hope is mutual, and each young desire</L>
<L>Flows from the soul in many a balmy sigh,</L>
<L>Or beams expression from the meeting eye.—</L>
<L>—Though Britain-born, the suppliant youth appears</L>
<L>A kneeling slave, with all a coward's fears—<SUP>d</SUP></L>
<L>—Thus where the prisoning cage its pass extends,</L>
<L>O'er the loved bait the hovering songster bends,</L>
<L>For yet untasted sweets, with furling wing,</L>
<L>Braves the bright bondage, and elastic string,</L>
<L>Quits his clear heaven abroad, his free command,</L>
<L>For the soft shelter, and the feeding hand,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="035844_0008_1006E8A957E3EFB0"/>Forgets the range, that roving youth required,</L>
<L>And all the charms his changeful heart admired,</L>
<L>On the smooth perch to wake the matin strain,</L>
<L>Pleased with his sateless feast, aad silken chain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But when compell'd to quit the brilliant plains,</L>
<L>Oppress'd by absence, languor, doubts and pains,</L>
<L>The pleading votary to his charmer flies,</L>
<L>And reads his sentence in her pardoning eyes,</L>
<L>Soon at her feet the welcome youth is found,</L>
<L>And soon chaste love the gordian chaplet bound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In vain the fondness of paternal care</L>
<L>Urged the dire evils of revolting war,</L>
<L>And still with many a boding sigh deplores</L>
<L>The armied ocean, and the bleeding shores,</L>
<L>Still press'd the stubborn beauty to remain</L>
<L>In the proud palace, and the green domain,</L>
<L>Of peaceful <HI>Albion</HI>'s bliss-encircled isle,</L>
<L>Where the arts flourish, and the pleasures smile.</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="035844_0009_1006E8AC778DF838"/>The enamour'd fair each social boon disdains,</L>
<L>Give me, she cries, the thunder of the plains,</L>
<L>Wide wasting famine, danger's worst alarms,</L>
<L>But give the shelter of my <HI>Ackland</HI>'s arms:</L>
<L>Not all the joys luxuriant scenes afford,</L>
<L>The festal banquet, and the costly board,</L>
<L>Not the soft soothings of the caroll'd lay,</L>
<L>Nor strains, that charm the ravish'd sense away,</L>
<L>Not peace, nor wealth, nor flattery's siren art,</L>
<L>Shall lure me from the monarch of my heart,</L>
<L>Shall give my hours in pamper'd ease to rest,</L>
<L>Torn from his view, and exiled from his breast.—</L>
<L>Thus scorning ills, superior to control,</L>
<L>With one triumphant passion in her soul,</L>
<L>She dreams of bliss, unsparing war defies,</L>
<L>And feels her fondness with her danger rise,</L>
<L>Nor heeds the hovering storm, whose ruthless sway</L>
<L>Will bid the vision'd landscape fade away.—</L>
<L>—So on the bowery margin of the deep,</L>
<L>When all the winds, save gentle zephyr, sleep,</L>
<L>Delusive scenes attract the raptured eye,</L>

<L>To the fond view the painted prospects die,</L>
<L>And flowers, and flocks, and trees, in blotted ruin lie.</L>

<L>Where polar tempests freeze the weeping skies,</L>
<L>Where giant-mountains lift their wreathless brows,</L>
<L>O'er tardy spring the blast of winter blows,</L>
<L>And <HI>brineless</HI> seas their nodding banks display</L>
<L>With sullen woods, that mock the solar ray:—</L>

<L>Rule the wide range—and, with alternate reign,</L>
<L>Pile the white clift, or fill the golden grain;</L>

<LG>
<L>Now to the melancholy noon of night</L>
<L>The black-wing'd hours had stretch'd their rapid flight,</L>

<L><HI>Harriet,</HI> the softest, fairest of her kind,</L>

<L>While the steep waves in moving mountains rose,</L>
<L>And the chill stars their heavy eyelids close,</L>
<L>On her sunk head the liquid tempest fell,</L>
<L>And the near torrent flung its dreadful yell,</L>
<L>Aghast, and trembling on the rocky coast,</L>
<L>By the sad view in breathless terror lost,</L>
<L><PB N="25" REF="035844_0024_1006E8EC350D7F48"/>Down her cold cheek forbidden sorrows roll,</L>
<L>And all <HI>the woman</HI> waken'd in her soul;</L>

<L>And smooth a passage o'er the surgy way;</L>
<L>The starting <HI>Harriet</HI> rushes from the shore,</L>
<L>And owns the guidance of the LEADING POWER.—</L>
<L>—So from the coast, where old <HI>Abydos</HI> stood,</L>
<L><HI>Leander</HI> ponder'd on the breaking flood,</L>
<L>Saw the storm thicken, and the billows rise,</L>
<L>Till the curved ocean met the scowling skies,</L>

<L>Enamour'd fancy brought the <HI>sestian tower,</HI></L>
<L>Triumphant love the warring winds defied,</L>
<L>And gave him guardless to the whelming tide.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now swift rebounding from the sheltery shore,</L>
<L>The patient sailor plies the sweeping oar,</L>
<L>Drunk with the gale, the staggering bark is tost</L>
<L>On every wave, that breaks the shelving coast,</L>
<L><PB N="26" REF="035844_0025_1006E8F2B2F570D0"/>Deep on its bulk the heavy rain descends,</L>
<L>On every side the tottering concave bends,</L>
<L>Yet Heaven, regardful of the prize it bore,</L>
<L>Guides the weak fabric to the distant shore,</L>
<L>Where, at the opening mountain's shaggy swell,</L>
<L>Stalks the tall, hardy, watchful sentinel;</L>
<L>When, dark descending on his mazed sight,</L>
<L>Like some dull bird, that haunts the omen'd night,</L>
<L>Doubtful he gazed, in wrapt suspension stood,</L>
<L>While the full wonder wore the labouring flood,</L>
<L>And through the surly deep's tumultuous roar,</L>
<L>Glides the weak whisper of the tapering oar;</L>
<L>On his waked thought unnumber'd fantoms grow,</L>
<L>The secret treason—The recruited foe—</L>
<L>The quiver'd chief, whose darts unerring fly—</L>
<L>Or the deep purpose of the fraudful spy—</L>
<L>Then with strong voice, hoarse quivering through the gales,</L>
<L>The heaving bark, and dripping seamen, hails—</L>
<L>—What are ye? whither come? as foe or friend?</L>
<L>Who thus mysterious through the clouds descend?</L>
<L>Spirits? or men more damn'd, in night's attire?</L>
<L>Say—or this tube shall speak in words of fire.—</L>
<L><PB N="27" REF="035844_0026_1006E8F62AEC8A68"/>Borne on the blast, the lessening accents fly,</L>
<L>And on the drowning waves in muttering murmurs die.—</L>

<L>When on his ear no answering sound returns,</L>

<L>From his fierce arm the ready tube extends,</L>

<L>Thank Heaven 'tis past, the matchless sufferer cries,</L>

<L>Then with firm mind, and trembling fingers, bound</L>
<L>Her snowy kerchief to the humid wound;</L>
<L>Patient and plaintless, while, in clamorous strain,</L>
<L>The shouting seamen strike the echoing main,</L>
<L>And soon, with nervous arm, and stretching oar,</L>
<L>Approach the shallows of the sandy shore;</L>
<L>There the mild son of Heaven benignant bends,</L>
<L>And from his arm the suppliant flag suspends,</L>

<L>The threatening guard her lifted step restrains,</L>
<L>And blocks her passage to the hostile plains;</L>
<L>Though grieved her guiltless sufferings to behold,</L>
<L>By prayers unmelted, and unmoved by gold,—</L>
<L>Here thou must stay—with martial voice exclaims,</L>
<L>Till o'er yon hills the kindling morning flames,</L>

<L>She hears unanswering, uncomplaining bears</L>
<L>The throb of anguish, and the weight of fears,</L>
<L>Till, round the rising mountain's verdant way,</L>
<L>The pale star purples with auspicious ray,</L>
<L>Sacred to Venus—and to Love benign,</L>
<L>Dispels the storm, and bids the landscape shine;</L>
<L>Then from the plains, along the brightening coast,</L>
<L>Extends a rude, inquiring, wondering host▪</L>
<L>Soon from the leader of the gazing band,</L>
<L>Flies the swift herald, and the mild command,</L>

<L>E'er felt the rapture of auspicious love,</L>

<L>To the poor hut, where wounded <HI>Ackland</HI> lies,</L>
<L>Lead my weak steps, and guide my searching eyes:</L>

<L>A willing captive to your hostile shore,</L>
<L>Deign to defend, and, dearer far than life,</L>
<L>To the brave husband give the banish'd wife.—</L>
<L>—The polish'd chief with soothing voice complied,</L>
<L>Commands the rapid car, and cautious guide,</L>
<L>And oft the melancholy beauty prest</L>
<L>To cheer the sadness of her boding breast:—</L>
<L>Grateful she hears, with pensive smile replies,</L>
<L>While doubts, and fears, and hopes, alternate rise,</L>
<L><PB N="31" REF="035844_0030_1006E907CD50C0A0"/>Her soft, imploring eye, with upward gaze,</L>
<L>Rests on high Heaven, and mingles grief with praise—</L>
<L>—Thus some fair youth, whom cruel avarice dooms,</L>

<L>To lose his days,—if generous pity see</L>
<L>His pleading tears, and bid the wretch go free,</L>
