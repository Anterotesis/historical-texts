<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HEre are present of His Majesties <HI>Council,</HI> Several of this place, besides whom there are <HI>other</HI> Gentlemen whom we have desired to be here as <HI>Witnesses</HI> of what we have in Charge to declare unto you.</P>
<P>And <HI>First,</HI> I must aquaint you, that we may take you <HI>now</HI> only for such as you <HI>are,</HI> (viz.) <HI>considerable Gentlemen</HI> of this place, &amp; <HI>Inhabitants</HI> of all parts of the Countrey, and <HI>so</HI> a <HI>proper</HI> Assembly to have His Majesties Commands Communicated to you, and under <HI>that</HI> Notion we treat with you, we may not deal with you as a <HI>Governour and Company</HI> any more.</P>
<P><PB REF="039235_0003_101808BEA85BF090"/>The <HI>first</HI> Thing we notifie to you is the <HI>Exemplification of a Judgement</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntered on His Majesties behalf, given in His <HI>High Court of Chauncery</HI> against <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he <HI>Charter</HI> and <HI>Government</HI> of this place; We are commanded to make <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t known to His Majesties Subjects here, and we are willing to do it first to <HI>yourselves.</HI> From your Attourney (while you were in Being) I had a Co∣py of it, and it was communicated to the <HI>Council</HI> here, read in the <HI>House of Magistra<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es</HI> and in the <HI>House of Deput<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es,</HI> the Difference between them is in these words [<HI>Where a Copy of the</HI> INSPEXIMUS <HI>was read</HI>] I leave it with you to be added to what I formerly gave you: If any Gentlemen desire further Satisfaction, there will be an <HI>Office</HI> open suddenly where it may be seen.</P>
<P>The <HI>next</HI> Thing is, <HI>His Majesties pleasure to settle a</HI> GOVERNMENT <HI>here</HI>; The Copy of His Royal COMMISSION for that end we sent to you and understand it has been Communicated. We are next to notifie unto you His Majesties GRACE and FAVOUR for the En∣couragement of Trade, in Settling a VICE-ADMIRALTY here, with Power and Authority to extend from the Territory of <HI>New-York</HI> to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he utmost bounds of His Majesties Dominion <HI>Eastward,</HI> the Management of which is to be in <HI>this</HI> place, each Page is Signed with His Majesties <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wn Hand,</HI> (His <HI>Majesty</HI> being pleas'd to manage the <HI>ADMIRALTY</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n His own Royal Person) and I here present you with the Sight of it.</P>
<P>We have further, Letters from <HI>His Majesty</HI> and the Honourable the <HI>Lords Committees</HI> for <HI>Forreign Plantations,</HI> and I am willing His Majesties <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ubjects here should know (so farr <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> concerns them) the <HI>Directions</HI> and <HI>Instructions</HI> therein Contained. And we have other <HI>particular</HI> Instruct<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions for His Majesties Service; but if any be so <HI>hardy</HI> (as is said) to <HI>object</HI> to any Clauses in His Majesties <HI>Commission,</HI> we have no Direction or Allow∣ance to capitulate with you about His Majesties Command therein. We hope you will not <HI>ask</HI> things of <HI>us,</HI> we are not allowed to argue, Such most apply themselves immediately to <HI>His Majesty.</HI></P>
<P>It may be thought the Unkindness of This good People, and the many In∣juries they have done me may have put me forward to doe more in this matter than other-wise I would have done▪ I will endeavour, and (I will assure you) I will pray to God to enable me I may <HI>forget</HI> all Injuries and and prejudices, and if I can do any thing towards an <HI>Idulgence</HI> in matters of Religion, and put forward the Good of this Place, and represent their Griev∣ances (when I shall orderly know them) I shall be glad to serve you as well as ever I have done and more.</P>
<P>The <HI>Address</HI> of this Countryes Governour and Company could not come to the King's ear, nor obtain the sight of His Majesty, but if these Gentlemen whose <HI>Estates</HI> and <HI>Interests</HI> are here amongst you can assist to the advance∣ing of any thing that can secure you, or represent your <HI>Interest</HI> to the King, His Majesty has allowed us and graciously <HI>commanded</HI> us so to doe; and there will be alwaies something for you to <HI>ask</HI> which cannot be laid before His Majesty but by the humble Address of the Persons <HI>now</HI> betrusted, and you need not <HI>sollicit</HI> them to assist in what they know requisite for this Peoples Good.</P>
<P><HI>Mr.</HI> Danforth. <HI>I suppose you expect no Reply from the Court?</HI></P>
