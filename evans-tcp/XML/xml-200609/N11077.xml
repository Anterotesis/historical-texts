<HEAD>General GAGE's Confession, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>COMPASSION—'tis a stranger to my heart,</L>
<L>Or if it comes—un welcome guest depart,—</L>
<L>Boston farewel, thy final doom is pass'd,</L>
<L><HI>North</HI> hears my prayers, and I'm recall'd at last;</L>
<L>Sailor on high thy canvas wings display,</L>
<L>Howl ye West winds and hurry me away;</L>
<L>Rise boisterous clouds and bellowing from on high,</L>
<L>Whisk me along, ye tyrants of the sky—</L>
<L>Quick, let me leave these friendless shores that shed,</L>
<L>Ten thousand curses on my hated head—</L>
<L>But why so swift, why ask I gales so strong,</L>
<L>Since conscience, cruel conscience goes along,</L>
<L>Must conscience rack my bosom o'er the deep?</L>
<L>I live in hell while she forbears to sleep;</L>
<L>Come father <HI>Francis,</HI> be my heart display'd,</L>
<L>My burden'd conscience asks thy pious aid;</L>
<L>Come, if confession can discharge my sin,</L>
<L>I will confess till hell itself shall grin,</L>
<L>And own the world has found in me again,</L>
<L>A second <HI>Nero,</HI> nay another <HI>Cain.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>FRIAR.</HEAD>
<L>Why swells thy breast with such distressing woe?</L>
<L>Your honour surely has the sense to know,</L>
<L>Your sins are veneal—trust me when I say,</L>
<L>Your deepest sins may all be purg'd away—</L>
<L>But if misfortunes rouse this mighty grief,</L>
<L>Sure friar <HI>Francis</HI> can afford relief:</L>
<L>I thought e're this that leaders of renown,</L>
<L>Would scorn to bow to giddy fortune's frown,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="014039_0003_0F92AC039D79CE90"/>
See yon bright Star (the dewy eve begun)</L>
<L>Walks his gay round and sparkles in the sun;</L>
<L>Faints not, encircled by the ambient blaze,</L>
<L>Tho' pestring clouds may sometimes blunt its rays</L>
<L>But come, confession makes the conscience light,</L>
<L>Confess, my son, and be absolv'd this night.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>GAGE.</HEAD>
<L>First of the first, I tell it in your ear</L>
<L>(For tho' we whisper, heaven you know can hear)</L>
<L>This faultless country ne'er deserv'd my hate,</L>
<L>Just are its pleas; unmerited its fate.</L>
<L>When <HI>North</HI> ordained me to this thankless place,</L>
<L>My conscience rose and star'd me in the face,</L>
<L>And spite of all I did to quench its flame,</L>
<L>Convinc'd me I was wrong before I came—</L>
<L>But what alas, can mortal heroes do,</L>
<L>They are but men, as sacred writings shew—</L>
<L>Tho' I refus'd they urged me yet the more,</L>
<L>Nay, even the king descended to implore,</L>
<L>And often with him in his closet pent,</L>
<L>Was plagu'd to death to rule this armament,</L>
<L>Who could a monarch's favourite wish deny?</L>
<L>I yielded just for peace—ay faith did I—</L>
<L>If this be sin, O tell me, reverend sage,</L>
<L>What will alas, become of guilty <HI>Gage?</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>FRIAR.</HEAD>
<L>If this be sin—'tis sin I make no doubt,</L>
<L>But trust me honour'd sir, I'll help you out,</L>
<L>Even tho' your arms had rag'd from town to town,</L>
<L>And mow'd like flags these rebel nations down,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="014039_0004_0F92AC045CB80D00"/>
And joyful hell return'd the murdering din,</L>
<L>And you yourself the master butcher been—</L>
<L>All should be well—from sins like this, I ween,</L>
<L>A dozen masses shall discharge you clean,</L>
<L>Small pains in purgatory you'll endure,</L>
<L>And hell you know is only for the poor,</L>
<L>Pay well the priest and fear no station there,</L>
<L>For heaven must yield to vehemence of prayer.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>GAGE.</HEAD>
<L>Heaven grant that this may be my smallest sin,</L>
<L>Alas, good friar, I'm yet deeper in—</L>
<L>Come, round my bed, with friendly groans condole,</L>
<L>To gratify my paunch, I've wrong'd my soul;</L>
<L>Arms I may wield and murder by command,</L>
<L>Spread devastation thro' a guiltless land,</L>
<L>Whole ranks to Hell with howling cannon sweep—</L>
<L>But what had I to do with stealing sheep?</L>
<L>I've read my orders, conn'd them o'er with care,</L>
<L>But not a word of stealing sheep is there;</L>
<L>Come, holy friar, can you make a shift,</L>
<L>To help a sinner at so dead a lift?</L>
<L>Or must I onward to perdition go,</L>
<L>With theft and murder to complete my woe?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>FRIAR.</HEAD>
<L>Murder—nay, hold—your honour is too sad,</L>
<L>Things are not yet I hope become so bad,</L>
<L>Murder, indeed—you've stole and that I know,</L>
<L>But, sir, believe me, you've not struck a blow,</L>
<L>Some few Americans have bled, 'tis true,</L>
<L>But 'twas the soldiers kill'd them, and not you.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="014039_0005_0F92AC05176092C8"/>
<HEAD>GAGE.</HEAD>
<L>Well said, but will this subtil reasoning stand,</L>
<L>Did not the soldiers murder by command,</L>
<L>By my command?—Friar, they did I swear,</L>
<L>And I must answer for their deeds I fear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>FRIAR.</HEAD>
<L>Let each man answer for his proper deed,</L>
<L>From sins of murder I pronounce you freed,</L>
<L>And this same reasoning will your honour keep,</L>
<L>From imputations of purloining sheep:</L>
<L><HI>Wallace,</HI> for this to <HI>Rome</HI> shall post away</L>
<L>And for this crying sin severely pay,</L>
<L>And tho' his zeal may think his penance slight,</L>
<L>Hair cloth and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shall be his bed at night,</L>
<L>Coarse fare by day—till his repeated groans</L>
<L>Convince the world he for this sin atones.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>GAGE.</HEAD>
<L>Alas, poor <HI>Wallace,</HI> how I pity thee?—</L>
<L>But let him go—'tis better him than me—</L>
<L>Yes let him harbour in some convent there,</L>
<L>And fleas monastic bite him till he swear—</L>
<L>But friar have you patience for the rest,</L>
<L>Half my transgressions are not yet confest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>FRIAR.</HEAD>
<L>Not half—you are a harmless man I'm told—</L>
<L>Pray cut them short—the supper will be cold.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>GAGE.</HEAD>
<L>Some devil regardless of exalted station,</L>
<L>In evil hour assail'd me with temptation,</L>
<L>To issue forth a damned proclamation,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="014039_0006_0F92AC060CDC82D0"/>
What prince, what king, from <HI>Belzebub</HI> is free,</L>
<L>He tempted <HI>Judas,</HI> and has tempted me!</L>
<L>This, this O friar was a deadly flaw,</L>
<L>This for the civil, founded martial law,</L>
<L>This crime will <HI>Gage</HI> to <HI>Lucifer</HI> consign,</L>
<L>And purgatory must for this be mine.</L>
<L>Next—and for this I breathe my deepest sigh,</L>
<L>Ah cruel, flinty, hard remorseless I—</L>
<L>How could I crowd my dungeons dark and low,</L>
<L>With wounded captives of our injur'd foe,</L>
<L>How could my heart more hard than hardned steel,</L>
<L>Laugh at the pangs that mangled captives feel?</L>
<L>Why sneer'd I at may fellow men distrest,</L>
<L>Why banish'd pity from this iron breast!</L>
<L>O Friar, could heaven approve my acting so,</L>
<L>Heaven still to mercy swift, to vengeance slow?—</L>
<L>O no—you say, then cease your soothing chat,</L>
<L>Cowards are cruel, I can instance that—</L>
<L>But hold, why did I, when the fact was done,</L>
<L>Deny it all to gallant WASHINGTON,</L>
<L>Why did I stuff th' epistolary page,</L>
<L>With vile invectives, only worthy <HI>Gage?</HI></L>
<L>Come friar help—shall I recant and say,</L>
<L>I writ my letter on a druken day?</L>
<L>How will it sound, if men should chance to tell</L>
<L>A drunken hero can compose so well?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>FRIAR.</HEAD>
<L>Your fears are groundless, give me all the blame,</L>
<L>I writ the letter, you but sign'd your Name,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="014039_0007_0F92AC069C93FE88"/>
Nor let the proclamation cloud your mind,</L>
<L>'T was I compos'd it and you only sign'd—</L>
<L>I friar <HI>Francis</HI>—papist tho' I be,</L>
<L>You private papists can't but value me;</L>
<L>Your sins in <HI>Lethe</HI> shall be swallowed up,</L>
<L>I'll clear you if you please before we sup.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>GAGE.</HEAD>
<L>Nay, clear me not—tho' I should cross the brine,</L>
<L>And pay my vows in distant <HI>Palestine,</HI></L>
<L>Or land in <HI>Spain</HI> a stranger poor and bare,</L>
<L>and rove on foot a wretched pilgrim there,</L>
<L>And let my eyes in streams perpetual flow,</L>
<L>Where great MESSIAH dy'd so long ago,</L>
<L>And wash his sacred footsteps with my tears,</L>
<L>And pay for masses fifty thousand years,</L>
<L>All would not do—my monarch I've obey'd,</L>
<L>And now go home, perhaps to lose my head—</L>
<L>Pride sent me here, pride blasted in the bud,</L>
<L>Which if it can, will build it's throne in blood,</L>
<L>With slaughter'd millions glut it tearless eyes,</L>
<L>And make all nature fall that it may rise,—</L>
<L>Come let's embark, your holy whining cease,</L>
<L>Come let's away, I'll hang myself for peace:</L>
<L>So <HI>Pontius Pilate</HI> for his murder'd Lord,</L>
<L>In his own bosom sheath'd the deadly sword—</L>
<L>Tho' he confess'd and wash'd his hands beside,</L>
<L>His heart condemn'd him, and the monster dy'd.</L>
