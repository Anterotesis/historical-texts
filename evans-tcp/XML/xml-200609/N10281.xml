<P>IT is become an universal custom for every Author, before he gives himself up to the fury of the Critics, to make his dying speech in a Preface; in which, according to the usu∣al style of criminals, he confesses his faults, tells the temptations that led him to the crime of scribbling, gives good advice to the rest of his fraternity, and throws himself upon the mercy of the Court. These speeches are com∣monly addressed to a sort of imaginary being, called the <HI>kind, courteous, candid</HI> and sometimes, <HI>benevolent Reader.</HI> Not that I would deny the existence of such a being, as an Epicurean once did of the soul, because he could not find an account of it, in the complete zoology of animals. The first part of this Poem met with very kind reception from many of this class: nor am I concerned least the second should receive any ill usage from them. Au∣thors have much more to fear from readers of a different stamp; and though we are usually loth to speak out so plainly, the truth is, we should not make such long prologues to the Candid, were we assured of our safety from the attacks of the Malicious. For my own part, being an enemy to ceremony and circumlocution, and having moreover some outstanding accounts to settle, I shall directly address myself to this last kind of Critic;
<PB N="vi" REF="013051_0004_0F8FF6765FD4A6B0"/>
assuring him however, upon my word of ho∣nour, that I was not moved to do him this homage, as the Indians are to worship the de∣vil, out of any fear of his power to do mis∣chief; since I have already experienced that his malice has its proper antidote in his im∣potence.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>To the Envious and Malicious Reader.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<HEAD>May it please your Worship, or your Reve∣rence; or your Illnature, by what title so∣ever dignified and distinguished:</HEAD>
<P><HI>AS you have expressed great resentment a∣gainst the first part of this Poem and its Author, you might perchance think your∣self slighted, if I should let the second come abroad without paying you my proper acknowledgements. I own myself much your debtor; and am only sorry that the number of your brotherhood is so inconsiderable, that the world may perhaps think this dedication almost entirely needless. Had a grea∣ter number shown themselves affected, I should have had more grounds to hope that the Poem might be useful. Satire is a medicine very salutary in its effects, but quite unpleasant in its operation; nor do I know a more evident symptom that the potion has taken its proper effect, than the groans and distortions of the Patient.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I had the pleasure, my Illnatured Reader, on the first publication of my poem, to hear the re∣marks made upon it by a cluster of your fraternity, who might each of them have sate for the picture of</HI> Tom Brainless. <HI>And as you may have fre∣quent
<PB N="vii" REF="013051_0005_0F8FF67716531680"/>
occasion to talk against it yourself, and yet be at some loss what to alledge in its reproach, I will do you the favor to acquaint you with the re∣sult of their criticisms; in order to save you the trouble of so much thinking, and assist you a little in the style and expression of your resentments.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It was determined by the meeting,</HI> nem. con. <HI>that the whole piece was low, paltry stuff, and both scurrilous in the sentiments and dirty in the style; that it was evident, the Author knew no∣thing of language, or versification, and was inca∣pable of writing with any degree of elegance; that he was an open reviler of the Clergy, and an enemy to truth and learning; that his apparent design was to ridicule religion, disgrace morality, sneer at the present methods of education, and in short, write a satire upon</HI> Yale-College <HI>and the ten commandments; that he treated the subject in the most partial and prejudiced manner, and must certainly be either a Separatist, or a Sandemanian. Though the truth of the assertions in the poem could not so conveniently be denied, yet much was said against the intention of the Author; and it was affirmed that if indeed the world in one or two points was not quite so good, as they could wish it, yet things in the present state could never be altered for the better, and it was folly, or mad∣ness alone could propose it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Now to give you as much light as possible into this matter, I would assure you, the Author had very little hopes that the world would, in his day, arrive at the point of perfection, from which it is at present he knows not how many leagues distant; and his expectations are not very sanguine, that
<PB N="viii" REF="013051_0006_0F8FF677D8F196F0"/>
these pictures of the modern defective manners will do much service. He is fully sensible, that the moral World is as difficult to be moved out of its course, as the natural; that there is in it as much power of resistance or</HI> vis inertiae, <HI>as the Philo∣sophers term it; and that the projectors are e∣qually at a loss for engines and foothold. He is as much satisfied that the present year hath borne a sufficient number of fools to keep up the breed, as that there has been a tolerable crop produced every season, for these forty years past. But he thought, though perhaps the picture might not reclaim ma∣ny, there could be no harm in trying his hand at the draught: In which, if the good people, who sate for the painting, have the ill hap to find them∣selves drawn with a wide mouth, a long nose, or a blear eye, he begs of them to get a little acquain∣ted with their own faces, and see whether these be not their real defects of nature, before they begin to rail at the Painter, for the badness of their re∣semblance.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I am fully sensible, my Illnatured Reader, that you have good reasons in your own breast, to ac∣count for your resentment against my first essay, and direct you in the manner of your remarks. You ought in gratitude to defend that carelessness in the examination of Candidates for preaching, to which it is not at all impossible, but you may yourself be indebted for your reverence and your band. Justly may you despise the study of those finer Arts and Sciences, of which, in a smooth journey through life, you never once knew the want, or perceived the advantages: justly should you undervalue them in comparison with that antient Learning, which
<PB N="ix" REF="013051_0007_0F8FF6789938D150"/>
from experience you rightly term</HI> Solid, <HI>as your own wits were never able to penetrate it. With good reason also do you affirm the satire to be level∣led at the Clergy in general, since that assertion is the best method of preventing the public from drag∣ging to view those particular men, at whom it is, and ought to be, pointed; though you might dis∣cern, with any other eye than that of wilful pre∣judice, that the Author hath the highest veneration for the ministerial robe, or he would never thus trouble himself about the spots that defile it. As for those,</HI> however dignified in station, <HI>who rail at the Progress of Dulness, to gain favour with a particular party, or order of men, he thinks them unworthy the notice of an answer. He would hint only to such as hope to screen themselves in the croud, and draw on him the resentment of those he esteems, by affirming the satire to be general, that he would thank them, if they would so far throw off the mask, that by acquiring a right to their names, he may have an opportunity hereafter to render it more particular. He especially recom∣mends this hint to two Persons, the haughtiest Dullard, and the most impertinent Coxcomb of this age; from whom he has already received number∣less favours, and who by their future good conduct may stand a chance, at some fortunate period, to figure at the head of a Dedication to the first and second parts of the Progress of Dulness.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And new, my Evil Reader, with regard to the Poem before you, which is properly a counterpart to the other, I design pretty much to let it speak for itself. Perhaps, since I have now endeavour∣ed to ridicule and explode both extremes, this se∣cond part may assist you a little to judge what are
<PB N="x" REF="013051_0008_0F8FF6795043DD38"/>
the sentiments I would wish to enforce: but in plain truth, I have very little hopes of you. Ne∣vertheless before I leave you, I will tell you one secret, and give you a few words of advice. The secret, which I am sure you would never have been able to discover, is this; In conformity to the de∣licacy of your taste, I have raised the style of this part, about two degrees by the scale, higher than the other. The advice is, that it will be no unwise proceedure in you to hint that the spirit of the piece is not well supported, nor this part half so good as the first: and an observation, or two, upon the Author's impudence, seasonably introduced, might not be wholly without effect. But as to the old trite way of calling men, Heretics, Deists and Ar∣minians, it hath been lately so much hackneyed and worn out by some Reverend Gentlemen, that I cannot promise it would do you any manner of service.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I cannot conclude without declaring to the world in this public manner, that whoever shall take on himself this character, by criticizing on these Poems in the method above specified, shall have my free licence and permission to appropriate to himself the whole of this dedication, and be distinguished for the future by the title of my Envious and Ma∣licious Reader: and I do assure him that this pre∣face was written purposely for him; not designing however to exclude from a proper share every one, who shall join with him in those sentiments, from this first day of January, new style, A. D.</HI> 1773, <HI>henceforth, and as long as the world shall endure, be the same term longer or shorter.</HI></P>
<CLOSER>Witness my hand, <SIGNED>THE AUTHOR.</SIGNED>

<L>'TWAS in a town remote (the place</L>
<L>We leave the reader wise to guess;</L>
<L>For readers wise can guess full well,</L>
<L>What authors never meant to tell)</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>There dwelt secure a Country-clown,</L>
<L>The wealthiest Farmer of the town;</L>
<L>Tho' rich by villainy and cheats,</L>
<L>He bought respect by frequent treats;</L>
<L>Gain'd offices by constant seeking,</L>
<L>Squire, Captain, <HI>Deputy</HI> and Deacon;</L>
<L>Great was his pow'r; his pride as arrant:</L>
<L>One only Son his heir apparent.</L>
<L>He thought the Stripling's parts were quick,</L>
<L>And vow'd to make a man of <HI>Dick;</HI></L>
<L>Bless'd the pert dunce, and prais'd his looks,</L>
<L>And put him early to his books.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>More oaths than words <HI>Dick</HI> learn'd to speak,</L>
<L>And studied knav'ry more than greek;</L>
<L>Three years at school, as usual, spent,</L>
<L>Then all equipt to College went,</L>
<L>And pleas'd in prospect, thus bestow'd</L>
<L>His meditations, as he rode.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"All hail, unvex'd with care and strife,</L>
<L>The bliss of Academic Lfe;</L>
<L>Where kind repose protracts the span,</L>
<L>While Childhood ripens into man;</L>
<L>Where no hard parent's dreaded rage</L>
<L>Curbs the gay sports of youthful age;</L>
<L>Where no vile fear the Genius awes</L>
<L>With grim severity of laws;</L>

Where annual troops of Bucks come down,</L>
<L>The flow'r of ev'ry neighb'ring town;</L>
<L>Where wealth and pride and riot wait,</L>
<L>And ev'ry rogue may find his mate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Far from those walls, from pleasure's eye,</L>
<L>Let care and grief and labour fly,</L>
<L>The toil to gain the laurel-prize.</L>
<L>That dims the anxious student's eyes,</L>
<L>The pedant-air of learned looks,</L>
<L>And long fatigue of turning books.</L>
<L>Let poor, dull rogues, with weary pains,</L>
<L>To college come to mend their brains,</L>
<L>And drudge four years, with grave concern,</L>
<L>How they may wiser grow and learn.</L>
<L>Is wealth of indolence afraid,</L>
<L>Or does wit need pedantic aid?</L>
<L>The man of wealth the world descries,</L>
<L>Without the help of learning, wise;</L>
<L>The magic pow'rs of gold, with ease,</L>
<L>Transform us to what shape we please,</L>
<L>Give knowledge bright and courage brave,</L>
<L>And wits, that nature never gave.</L>
<L>But nought avails the hoarded treasure;</L>
<L>In spending only lies the pleasure.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>There Vice shall lavish all her charms,</L>
<L>And Rapture fold us in her arms,</L>
<L>Riot shall court the frolic soul,</L>
<L>And Swearing crown the sparkling bowl;</L>
<L>While Wit shall sport with vast applause,</L>
<L>And scorn the feeble tie of laws;</L>
<L>Our midnight joys no rule shall bound,</L>
<L>While games and dalliance revel round.</L>
<L>Such pleasures youthful years can know,</L>
<L>And Schools there are, that such bestow.</L>

<L>By <HI>Venus'</HI> nunn'ries circled round;</L>
<L>Where not, like monks, in durance hard,</L>
<L>From all the joys of love debarr'd,</L>
<L>The solitary Youth in pain</L>
<L>For rapture sighs, yet sighs in vain:</L>

<L>The half heard compliments, whose note</L>

<L>That all the Country-fop express,</L>
<L>The suit right gay, tho' much belated,</L>

<L>The watch, depending far in state,</L>
<L>Whose iron chain might form a grate;</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="013051_0013_0F8FF67E9477CAB8"/>
The silver buckle, dread to view,</L>
<L>O'ershad'wing all the clumsy shoe;</L>
<L>The white-glov'd hand, that tries to peep</L>
<L>From ruffle, full five inches deep;</L>
<L>With fifty odd affairs beside,</L>
<L>The foppishness of country-pride.</L>

<L>Poor <HI>Dick!</HI> tho' first thy airs provoke</L>
<L>Th' obstrep'rous laugh and scornful joke,</L>
<L>Doom'd all the ridicule to stand,</L>

<L>To shine a Witling and a Fop.</L>
<L>Blest impudence the prize shall gain,</L>
<L>And bid thee sigh no more in vain.</L>
<L>Thy varied dress shall quickly show</L>
<L>At once the spendthrift and the Beau.</L>
<L>With pert address and noisy tongue,</L>
<L>That scorns the fear of prating wrong,</L>
<L>'Mongst listning coxcombs shalt thou shine,</L>
<L>And ev'ry voice shall echo thine.</L>
<L>As when, disjointed from the stock,</L>
<L>We view with scorn the shapeless block,</L>

<L>The wood in any form he chuses;</L>

The lowest dunce, without despairing,</L>

<L>The heroism of brazen lungs,</L>

<L>The ruffle, where from open'd vest</L>
<L>The rubied brooch adorns the breast;</L>
<L>The coat with length'ning waist behind,</L>
<L>Whose short skirts dangle in the wind;</L>
<L>The modish hat, whose breadth contains</L>

<L>He struts in all the joys of show,</L>
<L>That Tailors give, or Beaus can know.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And who for Beauty need repine,</L>
<L>That's sold at ev'ry Barber's sign;</L>

Pleas'd, while he thus in form addrest her,</L>
<L>With his own gracefulness of gesture,</L>
<L>And gaudy flatt'ry, that displays</L>
<L>A studied elegance of phrase.</L>
<L>So gay at balls the Coxcomb shone,</L>
<L>He thought the Female world his own.</L>
<L>By beauty's charms he ne'er was fir'd;</L>
<L>He flatter'd where the world admir'd.</L>
<L>Himself (so well he priz'd desert)</L>
<L>Possest his own unrivall'd heart;</L>
<L>Nor charms, nor chance, nor change could move</L>
<L>The firm foundations of his love:</L>
<L>His heart, so constant and so wise,</L>
<L>Pursued what Sages old advise,</L>
<L>Bade others seek for fame or pelf;</L>
<L>His only study was Himself.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet <HI>Dick</HI> allow'd the Fair, desert,</L>
<L>Nor wholly scorn'd them in his heart;</L>
<L>There was an end (as oft he said)</L>
<L>For which alone the Sex were made,</L>
<L>Whereto, of nature's rules observant,</L>
<L>He strove to render them subservient;</L>
<L>And held the Fair by inclination,</L>

<L>Her lodging in a female mind;</L>
<L>Quoted from <HI>Pope,</HI> in phrase so smart,</L>
<L>That all the Sex are "rakes at heart,"</L>
<L>And prais'd <HI>Mahomet'</HI>s sense, who holds</L>
<L>That Women ne'er were born with souls.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus blest, our Hero saw his name</L>
<L>Rank'd in the foremot lists of fame.</L>

<L><PB N="25" REF="013051_0023_0F8FF689EF82C3F8"/>
What tho' the Fair, of higher mind,</L>
<L>With brighter thought and sense refin'd,</L>
<L>Whose fancy rose on nobler wing,</L>
<L>Scorn'd the vain, gilt, gay, noisy thing!</L>
<L>Each light Coquette spread forth her charms,</L>
<L>And lur'd the Hero to her arms.</L>
<L>For Beaus and light Coquettes, by fate</L>
<L>Were each design'd the other's mate,</L>
<L>By instinct love, for each may find</L>

<L>Then let the wiser sort desert 'em,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor did the coxcomb-loving climate</L>
<L>To these alone his praises limit.</L>
<L>Each gayer Fop of modern days</L>
<L>Allow'd to <HI>Dick</HI> the foremost praise,</L>
<L>Borrow'd his style, his airs, grimace,</L>
<L>And aped his modish form of dress.</L>
<L>Ev'n Some, with sense endued, felt hopes</L>
<L>And rais'd ambition to be fops:</L>
<L>But Men of sense, 'tis fix'd by fate,</L>
<L>Are Coxcombs but of second rate.</L>
<L>The pert and lively <HI>Dunce</HI> alone</L>

<L>The lively Dunce alone can climb</L>
<L>The summit, where he shines sublime.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But ah! how short the fairest name</L>
<L>Stands on the slipp'ry steep of fame!</L>
<L>The noblest heights we're soonest giddy on:</L>
<L>The sun ne'er stays in his meridian;</L>
<L>The brightest stars must quickly set;</L>
<L>And <HI>Dick</HI> has deeply run in debt.</L>

<L><PB N="26" REF="013051_0024_0F8FF68B4980C510"/>
Not all his oaths can Duns dismay,</L>
<L>Or deadly Bailiffs fright away;</L>
<L>Not all his compliments can bail,</L>
<L>Or minuets dance him from the jail.</L>
<L>Law not the least respect can give</L>
<L>To the laced coat, or ruffled sleeve.</L>
<L>Off fly at once, in saddest woe,</L>
<L>The dress and trappings of the Beau;</L>
<L>His splendid ornaments must fall,</L>
<L>And all is lost; for these were all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What then remains? in health's decline,</L>
<L>By lewdness, luxury and wine,</L>
<L>Worn by disease, with purse too shallow,</L>
<L>To lead in fashions, or to follow,</L>
<L>The meteor's gaudy light is gone;</L>
<L>Lone Age with hasty step comes on;</L>
<L>The charms he once with pride display'd,</L>
<L>All vanish'd into empty shade;</L>
<L>And only left, in tawdry show,</L>
<L>The superannuated Beau.</L>
<L>How pale the palsied Fop appears,</L>
<L>Low-shivring in the vale of years;</L>
<L>The ghost of all his former days,</L>
<L>When folly lent the ear of praise.</L>
<L>And Beaus with pleas'd attention hung</L>
<L>On accents of his chatt'ring tongue.</L>
<L>Now all those days of pleasure o'er,</L>
<L>That chatt'ring tongue must prate no more.</L>
<L>From ev'ry place, that bless'd his hopes,</L>
<L>He's elbow'd out by younger Fops.</L>
<L>Each pleasing thought unknown, that chears</L>
<L>The sadness of declining years,</L>
<L>In lonely age he sinks forlorn,</L>
<L>Of all, and ev'n himself, the scorn.</L>

<L>The Coxcomb's course were wondrous clever,</L>
<L>Would health and money last forever,</L>
<L>Did Conscience never break the charm,</L>
<L>Nor fears of future worlds alarm.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But oh, since youth and years decay,</L>
<L>And life's vain follies fleet away,</L>
<L>Since Age has no respect for Beaus,</L>
<L>And Death the gaudy scene must close,</L>
<L>Happy the Man, whose early bloom</L>
<L>Provides for endless years to come;</L>
<L>That learning seeks, whose useful gain</L>
<L>Repays the course of studious pain,</L>
<L>Whose fame the thankful age shall raise,</L>
<L>And future times repeat its praise;</L>
<L>Attains that heart-felt peace of mind,</L>
<L>To all the will of heav'n resign'd,</L>
<L>Which calms in youth, the blast of rage,</L>
<L>Adds sweetest hope to sinking age,</L>
<L>With valued use prolongs the breath,</L>
<L>And gives a placid smile to death.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then let us scorn the praise that springs</L>
<L>From gaudy, sublunary things.</L>
<L>Hate the vain joys, that vice can claim,</L>
<L>To nobler thoughts exalt our aim,</L>
<L>With ardour seek th' immortal prize,</L>
<L>And seize our portion in the skies.</L>
