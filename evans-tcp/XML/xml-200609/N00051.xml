<L>FRom Honour into Honour go (the Lord thus calling thee)</L>
<L>To higher Honour, then there could on Earth obtained bee.</L>
<L>Heav'n is the Seat of Honour for those whom he Crowns with Grace;</L>
<L>For the most honourable Crowns, Heav'n is the onely place.</L>
<L>By men that are most ignorant of Gods revealed Will,</L>
<L>Thou may'st be miserable thought; for so they construe still</L>
<L>(Like bruitish ones) the mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de of God if Saints die in a swoo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</L>
<L>As if their Sun, all bright before, Were now gone down at Noon.</L>
<L>As if their case were now by farre the more to be deplor'd,</L>
<L>As that which doth but little hope (or none) of Bliss afford.</L>
<L>Yea, holy <HI>Job</HI> his Friends to this did too-too much incline,</L>
<L>[<HI>That sudden Changes, such us his, do argue Wrath divine.</HI>]</L>
<L>But when the Saints do perish thus (as foolish men conceive)</L>
<L>That is the time, and means whereby more Honour they receive,</L>
<L>As being Crown'd with Royal Crowns which are at Gods right hand.</L>
<L>Like <HI>Joseph</HI> from his Dungeon rais'd by the Kings Command.</L>
<L>T w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> a translation marvellous which did <HI>En<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch</HI> re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ove</L>
<L>From out this sinful world, to be crown'd in the Heav'ns above,</L>
<L>Where now he lives, &amp; reigns, with heaps of highest honour fill'd,</L>
<L>All his Predictions to be from time to time fulfill'd.</L>
<L>An unexpected death did seize on <HI>Jobs</HI> posteritie,</L>
<L>But in the Heav'ns a glorious Lot for them prep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r'd did lie.</L>
<L><HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> when as they had suffer'd much, were bid</L>
<L>As 't were, before their time to die (as in their Mounts they did)</L>
<L>What if the Land of <HI>Canaan</HI> they might not visit? yet</L>
<L>A place more glorious in the Heav'ns they, both of them, did get.</L>
<L>In flaming fiery-Charet wrapt from earth <HI>Elijah</HI> was,</L>
<L>And by the same convey'd he was unto his bliss-ful place.</L>
<L>Be it that good <HI>Josiah</HI> were cut off with suddain stroke,</L>
<L>He dy'd in peace, and unto rest eternal was he t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke.</L>
<L>No funeral to Sion was as his so lamentable,</L>
<L>Yet was his death as well as life to him most honourable.</L>
<L>Theirs was the griefe, the joy was his, God highly honourd him,</L>
<L>Although his death to carnal eyes might miserable seem.</L>
<L>The cursed executioner cut off <HI>John Baptist'</HI>s head,</L>
<L>But how did Jesus honour him both when alive, and dead.</L>
<L>The Crowned Martyr holy <HI>Stephen</HI> in cruel wise was ston'd,</L>
<L>But by his ble<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed Saviour's most sweet i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>braces own'd.</L>
<L>Yea, Christ himself, Gods own dear Son, whose death more woeful was</L>
<L>Yet from his cross how soon advanc'd to that most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lorious place!</L>
<L>So God his Christ with honour crown'd; So Christ doth honour his,</L>
<L>To whom Gods Honour, and his Christ's, most dear and precious is.</L>
<L>And such an one our <HI>Norton</HI> was whose death we so lament,</L>
<L>Whose whole desire was upon Christ and on his glory bent</L>
<L>None can deny it good nor bad, like as to <HI>Samuel</HI></L>
<L>They all were forced to confess he had done all things well,</L>
<L>If any one should have an heart with envy fill'd so much</L>
<L>As unto him his honour due malignantly to gru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch</L>
<L><PB REF="000090_0005_0FA01447000D9490"/>
Yet this will adde unto the weight of his most glorious Crown,</L>
<L>And both in sight of God and men increase his high renown.</L>
<L>Tis true: he was a man, and none himself abhorred more;</L>
<L>But none did more the Lords free grace in Jesus Christ adore.</L>
<L>Nothing but this, to know, or preach, or share in did he with</L>
<L>This was on Earth, as 'tis in Heav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n his blessed Paradice.</L>
<L>To Honour Christ he was content as well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, as Land,</L>
<L>His Life to venture, yea his ALL, was All at Christ's Command.</L>
<L>The care of all His Churches-dear lay heavy on his heart,</L>
<L>As he did ever, but at last, most fully it impart.</L>
<L>His life was nothing but of death a daily meditation,</L>
<L>And to his happy end, at last, a solemn preparation.</L>
<L>He was a man (if any were) that loved truth, and peace,</L>
<L>Which to promote, in every kinde he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all did cease.</L>
<L>An Orthodox Divine he was (his writings all do show,)</L>

<L>Decrying every sect, but most abhorring <HI>Quakerisme.</HI></L>
<L>His last both words, and works (like Davids) were the best</L>
<L>And as his death more neer approach'd more lively then the rest.</L>

<HEAD>SION the Out-cast healed of her Wounds. BEING THE FIRST SERMON: AND Preached at the COURT of ELECTION, MAY XXII. 1661.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>

<Q><HI>For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the Lord; because they called thee an Out-cast, saying, This is Sion, whom no man seeketh after.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THis Text may be called <HI>A Divine Plaister for a Sin∣sick Out-cast:</HI> in other words it is <HI>Gods C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re of</HI> Sion, <HI>when incurably Wounded.</HI> You have here the Patient described from divers Adjuncts: some Inherent, a∣biding in the Patient; some Extrinsecal, relating to the Patient. That which is Abiding, is that she is an Out-cast, Wounded, and Sick: That which is Extrinsecal, relateth either to the Specta∣tors, or to the Physician. To the Beholders: and there you have their disaffection, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>They called thee an Out-cast, saying, &amp;c.</HI> To the Physician: and there you have his affection, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>I will restore health to thee, and will heal thee of thy wounds:</HI> which Af∣fection is amplified, 1. From the Cause, <HI>Because they called thee an Out-cast, therefore will I heal thee.</HI> 2. From the Infallibility of it, upon the testimony of this Physician; <HI>Thus saith the Lord.</HI> They say, <HI>Thou art an Out-cast:</HI> the Lord saith, <HI>He will restore her.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="000090_0007_0FA014488DB59520"/>
To open the words briefly. The <HI>Patient,</HI> Here you finde, 1. An [<HI>Out-cast</HI>] It doth immediately look to the good Figs that were in <HI>Babylon,</HI> and they were in a manner voluntary Exiles, they yielded themselves to go: and such an Out-cast is here meant, as is not onely cast out of the Country, but out of the hearts and affections of others. Several Comparisons there are, that set forth this <HI>Out-cast;</HI> as, that of a menstruous woman, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>am.</HI> 1.17. of the person cast out of the Synagogue, <HI>Ezra</HI> 10 8. <HI>Ioh.</HI> 9. 22. and that of the Leper, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 26.21. he dwells in an house apart; and as <HI>Iephthah,</HI> thrust and expelled out of his Fathers house; cast out of doors, and out of hearts and esteem. 2. But not onely is <HI>Sion</HI> an Out-cast, but an Out-cast [<HI>Wounded</HI>] and it is <HI>Laesio ad mortem,</HI> a deadly wound; and an incurable wound, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er.</HI> 30.12. <HI>i.e.</HI> according to man: And not a green Wound, but an Ulcer, a festered Wound and Sore; and no wonder then she is also sick. And if we look to the Extrinsecal Adjuncts which accom∣pany this Patient, there is that which relates unto</P>
<P N="1">1. The Beholders: They say [<HI>This is Sion, whom no man seek∣eth after.</HI>] They did reproach her, and there was no denial of it; <HI>Is not this</HI> Sion! 'tis spoken in way of derision: the sarcasm of an Enemy. <HI>Sion</HI> was a word of honour, but they here relate to the Notation of the Hebrew word, from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Siccitas,</HI> as being a dry, withered, sapless thing; a barren, and forsaken, and undesirable place and society. And further [<HI>Whom no man seek∣eth after</HI>] Neither this sort of men, nor that sort of men; none hath any care of her welfare.</P>
<P N="2">2. A second kinde of Extrinsecal Adjuncts relate unto the Physician; [<HI>Therefore I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee.</HI>] Now God will apply a sanative Cataplasm, an healing Plaister: This is Repentance, and Restitution, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er.</HI> 31.9. Re∣pentance, and their Return, make up the sanative Plaister. In respect of her self, there was need of Repentance; in respect of the adversary, there was need of Reduction. And the Cause of it, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> [<HI>Because they called thee an Out-cast</HI>] as who should say, I am sensible of all thy case, and the opprobrie thou hast suffered, therefore will I restore thee. But shall not this fail?
<PB REF="000090_0008_0FA014496A87D910"/>
No, Jehovah's word is engaged for it, <HI>Thus saith the Lord.</HI></P>
<Q>Doct. When Sion for its sin is become an Out-cast (a subject of contempt) God takes occasion from her Calamity to give her Repentance, that so he may bring upon her the Blessing of his own People.</Q>
<P>I will not more then intimate to you the Paradoxes that the Text doth abound with. <HI>Sion,</HI> and acknowledged, and yet no man careth for her. A People, none neglected like them; a People, none beloved like them: Neglected, if you look at men; beloved, if you look at God. A People, whose very adversaries are instrumental to their prosperity. These are such Riddles, as we may truely say Gods grace onely makes. A strange occasion may that seem to be, which God takes for the healing of his People in <HI>Isa.</HI> 57.17,18. <HI>I have seen his wayes</HI> (<HI>i. e</HI> his froward∣ness and covetousness) <HI>and will heal him.</HI> Ezek. 11. 15, 16, 17. <HI>Thy brethren, even thy brethren, &amp;c. they say, Ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> ye farre from the Lord, unto us is the land given in possession: Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord, although I have cast them farre off, &amp;c. though I have scattered them, &amp;c. yet will I be a little Sanctuary unto them—I will gather you, &amp;c.</HI> Zech.3.2. <HI>The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan, even the Lord that hath chosen Jerusalem: Is not this a brand pluckt out of the fire?</HI> They had been in the Furnace long enough. As the Lord dealeth thus with his people, so <HI>David</HI> maketh use of the like in his personal case, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 16. 12. <HI>It may be the Lord will look upon mine affliction, and requite me good, &amp;c. bless me, because of his cursing.</HI></P>
<P>The Reasons of the point, are:</P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 1. From the Sympathy that there is between the Head and the Members. Christ is sensible of the sufferings of his Out∣cast. It is true, that the Out-cast doth suffer; it is a greater truth, that the God of the Out-cast suffereth. Isa. 63. 9. <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all their affliction, he was afflicted:</HI> it relateth to Israel in <HI>Egypt.</HI> Zech. 2.8. <HI>He that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of his Eye:</HI> it relateth to the good Figs in exile. It is no little ease that our sorrows
<PB N="4" REF="000090_0009_0FA0144A0D8E1BA8"/>
touch Christ, according to <HI>Hel.</HI> 4. 15. <HI>We have not an high Priest that cannot be touched, &amp;c.</HI> What though the Out-cast suffereth for sin, yet he hath a sufferer with him: and in this respect what <HI>Paul</HI> said to his Corinthians, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.2. that doth Christ say to his Out-cast, <HI>If I make you sorry, who is he that maketh me glad, but the same that are made sorry by me?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 2. Because that Gods Name suffereth, while his Out-casts do thus suffer. <HI>Exod.</HI> 32.12. if God should destroy Israel, the Egyptians will say, <HI>For mischief hath he brought them, &amp;c.</HI> Deut.32.27. <HI>Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and say, Our hand is high, and the Lord hath not done all this.</HI> You remember the argu∣ment which <HI>Ioshua</HI> useth, Chap.7,8,9. <HI>When Israel falleth before the enemy, what wilt thou do to thy great Name?</HI> The destruction of Israel would raise a scandal to Religion, and the God of Israel.</P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 3. To capacitate the Out-cast to receive the benediction of a Father, the actual blessing of his People. To be Gods peo∣ple, is one thing; but to be made meet to receive the blessing of his people, is another thing. <HI>Zech.</HI> 3. 2. <HI>The Lord, even the Lord that hath chosen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erusalem, &amp;c.</HI> God in election hath made them his people, and determined to bless them: 'tis this that doth pluck the brand out of the fire. Ier. 24. 5,6,7. <HI>I will set mine eyes upon them for good, I will bring them again, I will build them, I will give them an heart to know me, &amp;c.</HI> Ier.30.22. &amp; 31.33. <HI>I will be their God, and they shall be my people:</HI> and vers.9. <HI>Ye shall come with weep∣ing and supplications, &amp;c. [Ye shall come]</HI> there is their Return; [<HI>with weeping and supplications</HI>] there is their Repentance: and the Lord hath undertaken for it; <HI>I am a father to</HI> Israel, <HI>and</HI> Ephraim (as bad as he is) <HI>is my first-born.</HI> The cause of their being his people, a penitent people, a blessed people, is his fatherly relation to them, Ier.32.38,39. Ier.30.7. <HI>Alas, it is the time of</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acobs <HI>trouble, but he shall be saved out of it.</HI></P>

I may men∣tion notwithstanding, the Polititians observation concerning the stage of action usually changed in thirty years; because the persons that make the <HI>major</HI> vote, are usually changed, and gone by that time. Something about that time, hath our time been in this land, now perhaps the <HI>major</HI> vote is changed; you may say in such and such a case many a time, and had such been alive, these actions, and those, in Church or Court, would not have been so carried on. But I will not dwell here. I wish we might learn such in∣stances from some other example, and not from our selves.</P>
<P><HI>Instr.</HI> 2. <HI>Sions</HI> Apostacy brings upon <HI>Sion</HI> sad Calamity. 'Tis a truth, that Israel embraceth not God, til God first embrace Israel: 'tis also a truth, that God forsaketh not Israel, till Israel first for∣sake him. <HI>Ier.</HI> 5. 25. <HI>If good things be withheld from us, Iniquity is the cause. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>am.</HI> 3. 39. if evil things be brought upon us, the cause is sin.

Isai,</HI> 63. 17. you that think you have a new man, do not forget that you have within you also an old man, and calamity will not re∣move it.

<P><HI>Instr.</HI> 4. Though <HI>Sions</HI> malady be such, as that, lookt at in it self, it cannot be cured, yet looks at in Gods promise, and it cannot want a cure. Look upon it in it-self, and it seems incurable, look't at in the Physician, and it cannot but be cured. <HI>Jeremiah</HI> looking at his sufferings, he will speak no more; but looking at Gods promise, and it is as fire in his bones, he cannot but speak. 2. <HI>King.</HI> 8. 10. there is a quaerie put to the Prophet, whether <HI>Benhadad shall live;</HI> the prophet answers, <HI>He may certainly recover, howbeit, the Lord hath shewed me, he shall surely dye, i. e.</HI> the disease was not such but the might have recovered: so may I by allusion invert and say, <HI>Sions</HI> disease is incurable, but yet she shall certainly recover. Look at <HI>Sion</HI> in the glass of Providence, and she is as a woman forsaken, and grieved in spirit, <HI>Isai.</HI> 54. 5,6. <HI>&amp;</HI> 66. 4. hus∣bandless, as to reproach; and yet at the same time <HI>thy Maker is thy husband:</HI> if we look <HI>at Sion</HI> in the glass of the Promise, this Out-cast is both <HI>Marah,</HI> and <HI>Hephzibah,</HI> both a <HI>Widow,</HI> and <HI>Beulah.</HI> Look at the Out-casts tears, as an effect of mans not caring for her, but as an occasion, and demonstration of Gods care for her, <HI>Psal.</HI> 126. 5,6. that <HI>Sion</HI> sheddeth tears, denominateth her <HI>Marah;</HI> that <HI>Sions</HI> tears are seed, denominateth her <HI>Hephzibah.

<P><HI>Instr.</HI> 5. Gods touching an impenitent Out-cast with repen∣tance, is a signal of Gods having mercy thereon. <HI>Sions</HI> recovery by repentance from her backsliding, is an effect of grace, and a fore-runner of the set time of <HI>Sions</HI> mercy <HI>Sions</HI> impenitency, is

The enemy is never harder-hearted to <HI>Sion,</HI> then when <HI>Sion</HI> is hard-hearted to her God. Their affliction was not the hardness of the Babylonians hearts, but <HI>Lord, why hast thou hardned our hearts: Isai</HI> 63. 17. when the Out-casts return to <HI>Sion, they shall goe weep∣ing with their faces th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>herward, Jer.</HI> 50. 4,5.</P>

God proposeth to us Remedy, or Calamity: we have our option, whether that of the plaister, or of the sore; make we our choice. If we accept the plaister, the time of mercy, even the set time is come; if you do not accept it, you may look at it as the beginning of sorrow. That we are Out-casts, this doth speak us sick; but our not accept∣ing the remedy, speaks our sickness incurable. To be Out-casts, this argues that we are cast off by men; but our not accepting the remedy, speaketh us cast off by God: the condition of an Out-cast supposeth us sinners; but the rejection of the remedy doth say that we are castawayes: for an Out-cast to need a medicine, is common to good and bad; to accept it, is proper to the good.</P>
<P>Let us then accept the Lords Plaister. As an Ingredient there∣to, I shall propose this Direction; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P N="1">1. Learn we to judge aright of Liberty; Scripture-liberty. Gal. 5. 1. <HI>Paul</HI> biddeth us <HI>stand fast in our liberty:</HI> and those ac∣cursed ones he looks unto, Chap. 1. who also pleaded for liberty, and whom the Assertors of true Liberty should accordingly pro∣nounce accursed. Blessed men plead for liberty, and cursed men plead for liberty. The Gn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stick in 2 <HI>Pe.</HI> 2. 19. doth plead for liberty: Good men plead for liberty, and bad men plead for li∣berty: the best men plead for liberty, and the worst men plead for liberty. If you ask what Liberty is? you may look at it as a Power, as to any external restraint, or obstruction on mans part, to walk in the Faith, Worship, Doctrine and Discipline of the Gospel, according to the Order of the Gospel. When you hear
<PB N="8" REF="000090_0013_0FA0144D079C7898"/>
men plead for Liberty, see that it be not Liberty falsly so called.</P>
<P N="2">2. Acknowledge Order Divine, and in particular in that great Point of a Ministerial Judge. There are that make little of Or∣der, and yet we may think, not any made so little, as <HI>'Paul</HI> made much of it: <HI>Let All things be done in Order.</HI> 1 Cor. 14. 40. it seemeth an Apostolical spirit doth conclude, that sometimes better such a thing not done, then not orderly done. There is a judge∣ment Discretive, which belongeth to every Believer; there is a judgement Authoritative, that belongs unto the Church, and is set therein by God; and also there is a judgement Decisive, which belongs unto the Council: Onely remember, that the <HI>Supreme Judge</HI> is either 1. Authentick, <HI>i. e.</HI> Jesus Christ: or 2. Regu∣lative, <HI>i. e.</HI> the Scripture: or 3. Ministerial, <HI>i. e.</HI> the Council. This Question concerning a Ministerial Judge in matters of Reli∣gion, is that which hath greatly exercised the Christian world; insomuch that both Protestants and Papists agree, That the Reso∣lution of this Controversie is of so great moment, as that here∣upon depends the Resolution of all Controversies. When a Con∣troversie ariseth in a Church (differences must not alwayes con∣tinue) what shall resolve the same, if a Ministerial Judge be not ad∣mitted? Take away this Order, and how shall Peace, or the So∣ciety continue? This truth of a Ministerial Judge, is reckoned a∣mong the Fundamentals—<HI>Secundario,</HI> because it doth tend to the preservation of all that else is of the Foundation. You shall finde this Truth impleaded throughout all generations, since the Primi∣tive times, and pleaded for by all the Orthodox in all the Centu∣ries. Deut 17. 12. <HI>Standum senten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oe summi judicis:</HI> Israel must stand to this; if it be in matters of Religion, there is the Priest; if in matters Civil, there is the Magistrate, and be that stands not, or submits not to the Sentence of these, <HI>let him be cut off from Israel:</HI> so requisite a thing is Order. <HI>Acts</HI> 15. there is no rest in such a case; what now do they, but refer it to a Council, and that doth determine it. 1. Cor. 14. 32. <HI>The Spirit of the Prophets is subject to the Prophets.</HI> I will not acknowledge him a Prophet, that is not subject to the Prophets. Let not any one therefore under pretence
<PB N="9" REF="000090_0014_0FA0144DBB510730"/>
of a Prophet, or whatever Inspiration or Perswasion soever, ex∣empt themselves from subjection to Order.</P>
<P>Obj. <HI>The major part may erre, and is not alwayes the melior part: Councils and Churches may erre, and have erred.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. But is it not true, that the Objector may erre? The <HI>major</HI> part may erre; so saith the Delinquent standing before the Church, and must that evacuate all Church-power? 2. 'Tis more likely that truth should be with many Orthodox, Pious, Orderly, <HI>&amp;c. In the multitude of Counsellors</HI> (was anciently said, <HI>Prov.</HI> 11. 14.) <HI>there is safety.</HI> The Objector is one to many, and he is in his own case a Judge, but a Council in other mens. But if that be not a truth, that [<HI>We must subject to Order</HI>] because the <HI>major</HI> part may erre, then put an end to Church-administrations, there will be no end of Controversies. But distinguish we con∣cerning Councils. There is a Council Regular, of Orthodox and meet Members orderly gathered: There is a Council that is Ir∣regular, and abusive, as in times of Popery. When the Ark was taken by the Philistims, no marvel it was not Oraculous to Israel; but what Israelite refused to consult the Ark of God after its re∣turn from the Philistims, because they had abused it? You tell us, that Popish Councils have erred; and therefore must we forget that the Councils of the Orthodox have maintained the Truth, and have been the support of Religion in former times? Look to the <HI>Ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ene,</HI> and other Councils. Councils have been sometimes among the Philistims, among the Papists, and for so long a time; but shall we esteem the less of Orthodox Councils because of that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 3. Distinguish between the Truth of Order, and Truth Positive. <HI>John</HI> 8. 17. <HI>The testimony of two men is true:</HI> this is what God hath appointed for the Preservation of Society Humane and Christian. That is a truth <HI>in foro,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> in Church or Court, which may not be the truth positive. The God of Truth hath made it for to keep Societies in peace; and if it were not for this Institution, there could be no sitting in Judgement, or any Polity a∣mong men. 4. Remember that <HI>the Spirits of the Prophets are subject to the Prophet,</HI> 1. Cor 14. 32. the Spirits of the Elders are subject to the Elders, &amp;c. If this be not attended, there can be
<PB N="10" REF="000090_0015_0FA0144E83751DD8"/>
no Administration, or else there must needs be a meer rixation and chiding-administration. Where there is liberty and the Old man, there must needs be much Controversie; 'twere more sad if there were no Remedy. The non-admission of this help, renders the Churches, in case of Non-action, like the field of the sleeping Husbandman, <HI>Matth.</HI> 13. 25. or else like the Meeting of Israel at <HI>Meribah;</HI> either no Administrations, or manifold Alterations. 'Tis true, a Ship may live longer in a Calm, then in a Storm, but yet your Ship may be so long becalmed, that all the Provision may be spent, and so perish in time; and it may be better perish∣ing in a Storm, then in a Calm: a Storm is swifter to perishing, but both destructive. Either this Disease or that is mortal; the difference may be, that the one is Chronical, the other Acute: both the killing.

Obj. <HI>May not a good man suffer by this means? Answ.</HI> Sometimes we are called to suffer; and subjection to Order may be accompanied with suf∣fering for the Truth: and better an innocent and good man suffer, then Order, for that preserves the whole.</P>

Are there not those who labour to bereave us of our Liberties? Let us Sanctifie the Name of God herein.</P>
<P N="4">4. Attend we the Examples of the godly wise, for the con∣tinuing of our Liberty, in like cases. You will say, What is that? I answer, An Address to the Supreme Authority, and a just Apologie. If any say, What Example in Scripture have we

for an Address? Let such look to 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 4. 13. <HI>Wouldst thou be spoken for to the King?</HI> This did not unbecome the Prophet to propound to her.

To make an Address then is not that which is not according to Scripture. The like I might say relating to an Apologie.</P>
<P N="5">5. Let us walk in the use of our Liberty with innocency, and without offence. To differ from our Orthodox Pious, and Learned Brethren, is such an affliction to a Christian and inge∣nuous Spirit, as nothing but love to the Truth could arm a man of peace against: Our Profession being in a way differing from these and those, it doth the more concern us that our walking be very cautelous, and that it be without giving any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> offence. There will offence enough be taken at the Profession of the Truth, though the Professors thereof give none. The Profession of the Truth draweth upon us enmity, but errour in our Profession, and offensive walking, delivereth and betrayeth us into the hand of the enemy. And give me leave to speak freely, Let us see that we walk without offence toward Civil Authority: Suffer not your mindes to be prejudiced against the present, and ancient Govern∣ment of our Nation: Isa. 49. 23. <HI>Kings shall be thy N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sing-fathers, and Queen thy N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sing-mothers:</HI> 'tis spoken of Gospel-times.

It is but wisdome to give no cause, especially such as our own Consciences cannot testifie for, and such as all Orthodox Churches in the Protestant world will testifie against. In matters of the State-Civil, and of the Church, let it be shewn that we are his Disciples, who (<HI>Matth.</HI> 22. 21.) said, <HI>Give unto Cesar the things that are Cesars, and unto God the things that are Gods:</HI> and in mat∣ters of Religion, let it be known that we are for Reformation, and not for Separation.</P>
<P N="6">6. Lastly, Take care thar the Order of the Gospel may have a free passage in the Churches; I mean, that our Practice may effectually answer our Doctrine, in that Book entituled [<HI>The Platform of Church-Discipline</HI>] 'Tis that for which we are Out-casts at this day; that (for the substance of it) is it that sheweth what <HI>New-England</HI> is.

As concerning the Church-government according to the <HI>Platform of Discipline,</HI> the practice of which doctrine who careth for? is not this that truth which the Synod, Churches, the General Court sometime made a good Confession of, and that now no man comparatively careth for? <HI>Ezra</HI> 4. 8. <HI>Rehum</HI> cares not for it: <HI>ver.</HI> 23. <HI>Artaxerxes</HI> careth not for it: <HI>Nehem.</HI> 4. <HI>Sanballat,</HI> and <HI>Tobiah</HI> care not for it: the <HI>Episcopal</HI> man, the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> care not for it, the <HI>Morellian</HI> careth not for it: the <HI>Merchant,</HI> the <HI>Souldier,</HI> the <HI>Husbandman,</HI> the <HI>Labourer</HI> careth not for it. <HI>Haggai</HI> 1. <HI>The people of Jerusalem,</HI> the Church-members care not for it. I am apt sometimes to think that <HI>Aaron</HI> may be under a temptation of irregular complyance; but minde, <HI>Jer.</HI> 15. 19. <HI>Let them return unto thee, but return not thou unto them:</HI> I may say thus much (and pardon my speech) <HI>A more yeilding Ministry unto the People, I believe is not in the World.</HI> I beseech you let not <HI>Cesar</HI> be killed in the Senate, after he hath fought it out, and conquered in the Field: let us acknowledge the Order of the Eldership in our Churches in their way, and the Order of Coun∣cils in their way, duely back'd and encouraged; without which, Experience will witness that these Churches cannot long consist.</P>
<P>God hath opened the mouth of the Speaker to you this day, it being a day wherein after so many attempts and feares, you are betrusted with your Liberties for another year. You have this years oportunity, and at such a time, and blessed be the Lord God of our Fathers, who hath put such a thing in the Kings heart, so farre to accept your Application to his Majesty, as not onely to

give you the oportunity of the year present, but also encourage∣ment for many years to come. Let all of us be stirred up by the Lord, and at such a time, to strengthen the hand of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ubbable,</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> by your professed subjection to the Gospel of Christ. Do not betray liberty, under the pretence of liberty. You that are in the honoured Magistracy, remember <HI>Davids</HI> troubles, <HI>Psal.</HI> 132. 1,5. he could not rest till the Ark had rest. And those that are in the Ministry, remember <HI>Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'s</HI> troubles, and what his cares were, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. 28. Let us all minde what were the troubles and thoughts of heart that were in them that lived in the dayes of <HI>Malachi,</HI> Chap 3. 16. But are there not many that minde onely their cieled houses, &amp;c? and how much doth the work of the Out-cast lye unattempted, witness the sick estate of the Churches: and how can it be remedied, if we will not acknowledge Order? and shall I say that we are real therein? You have brought upon your selves real troubles, and likewise upon your Relations and Friends in <HI>England,</HI> and those here that suffer with you in this Exile: See then that you be not hypocritical, but real to the Truth which you have professed. I could tell you, and you must not forget it, That there have been <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n of Renown,</HI> as they are called <HI>Numb.</HI> 16. 2. <HI>Famous in the Congregation of Israel,</HI> that did go out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> but yet could not endure the Order of God in the wilderness. Let us shew it, that we mistook not our selves, pretending to come into this Wilderness to live under the Order of the Gospel. We are Out-casts indeed, and reproached; but let us be such Out-casts as are caring for the Truth, and therefore not to neglect an Apologie: it doth become, and greatly concern Gods Out-casts to minde it. You know there are those who represent you as disaffected to Government, and as Sectaries, and Schisma∣ticks, and as Fanaticks: you see cause to Apologize therein. And for that term of [<HI>Fanatick</HI>] you must remember it is not of yesterday, however it be now used or abused. You may learn the original use of it from that distribution of Professors, in relation to Church-government, in former times, into four sorts, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>Orthodax<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Pontificti, Rationales,</HI> and <HI>Fanatic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> But I trust that God doth, and Angles and Men shall know that we are Orthodox.
<PB N="15" REF="000090_0020_0FA01456D6924260"/>
Gods Out-casts are not Fanaticks. The Woman in the wilder∣ness may have the vomit of the Dragon cast in her face, if you let it lye on, you will suffer; wash it off therefore by an Apo∣logie. Thus did <HI>jusim <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Teru <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el,</HI> and others in their time. Give not the advantage of interpreting Silence as Consent, nor think it labour lost if an Apologie will wash your face. And though we may be cast out by men, yet may we hope that God will look after his Our-cast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and care for us, being Out-casts for the Truth. Let it appear that we are such Out casts, to whom the calamity and temptations of Out-casts are sanctified; Out-casts healed: Out-casts that care for the truth, and then Out-casts on which God will bring the blessing of his own people. If this plaister findeth acceptance with you, you shall finde esteem, and acceptance, and favour from God and man. Let us all labour so to carry it, as that we may have this <HI>Rejoycing of a good Cons∣cience</HI> to sweeten that bottle full of tears shed in your Out-cast condition in this wilderness, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That we came into it, not onely with a Spirit testifying, according to the Scriptures, against the Inventions of men, but also that we do come up unto the Institu∣tions of Christ; that as we have departed from Inventions Hu∣mane, so we may not be found to be, or here continue opposers against Institutions Divine; that we are not negligent of, but faithful to that Order of the Gospel which we are Out-casts for.</P>

<HEAD>THE BELIEVERS CONSOLATION, In the Remembrance of his Heavenly Mansion prepared for him by CHRIST. BEING THE SECOND SERMON: AND Preached on the LORDS-DAY, MARCH XXIX. 1663.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>John 14. 3.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>And if I go to prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you to my self, that where I am, there you may be also.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THis Verse, and the former, holds forth a double Con∣solation, to support the Disciples against the suffering which they were to conflict with, either <HI>In the way of Truth,</HI> or <HI>For the way of Truth.</HI> This Verse holds forth the second Argument of Consolation; the former you have in the second Verse: it is taken from the <HI>Place</HI> they were to be taken to after Death. And this Argument in this Verse is taken from the <HI>Company</HI> they shall have in that place; and that is his Personal Presence, his full and clear Presence: <HI>Where I am, there you shall be also.</HI></P>
<P>Now this Argument of Consolation is described, 1. From the <HI>Scope</HI> of Christ in preparing such a place for them; and it was, that he and they might be there together: <HI>I go to prepare a
<PB N="17" REF="000090_0022_0FA01458438EB4A0"/>
place for you, that where I am, there you may be also.</HI> 2. It is de∣clared from the <HI>Time</HI> when they must expect their being taken to Christ; and that is, when he comes again: <HI>I will come again, and receive you to my self.</HI> 3. It is declared from the <HI>Efficient</HI> of it, the Undertaker of this; and that is Himself: <HI>I will come again, and receive you to my self.</HI></P>
<P>To open the words thus resolved.</P>
<P N="1">1. Touching the Presence of Christ and Believers together [<HI>That where I am, there you may be also</HI>] you must understand this (of his Presence emphatically so called) of his Presence in the place of Blessedness: <HI>In thy Presence is fulness of joy,</HI> Psal. 16. 11. There is a double Presence of Christ, but he means here his Presence in Glory, where <HI>we shall see him as he is,</HI> 1 Joh. 3. 2. I said, this Argument of their Consolation was declared from the <HI>Scope</HI> of it; <HI>I go to prepare a place for you, that where I am, there you may be also:</HI> it was one great end of his being a Fore-runner. Secondly, he should fail of his Fidelity and Ability, if there should be a disappointment.</P>
<P N="2">2. From the <HI>Time</HI> [<HI>When I come again</HI>] Christs coming is either his last Coming or his coming by Death. Of his last coming you reade 1 <HI>Thess.</HI> 4. 18. Of his coming by Death, you reade <HI>Luke</HI> 23. 43. <HI>To day thou shalt be with me in Paradice.</HI> Now the Soul goes to Christ, when He comes to us by Death: at his last coming both Soul and Body shall be together with him.</P>
<P N="3">3. This Argument of Consolation is described by the <HI>Efficient</HI> of it, or Undertaker, [<HI>I will receive you to my self</HI>] We may doubt how our Souls, when we dye, shall come to Heaven: why, saith Christ, <HI>I will come, and receive you to my self.</HI> They therefore say properly, when they dye, that say, <HI>Into thy hands I commend my Spirit,</HI> Psal. 31. 5. it is a proper saying so to speak, because Christ he doth receive them. And <HI>Steven</HI> (again) he speaks, <HI>Acts</HI> 7. 59. <HI>Lord Jesus receive my Spirit.</HI> It is a blessed thing to commit our Souls by Faith to Christ, when they go out of the Body. He comes by the ministry of his Angels, or otherwise as he please: <HI>I will come again, and receive you to my self.</HI> You may remember the words of <HI>Steven,</HI> he dying, <HI>called upon God, and said, Lord
<PB N="18" REF="000090_0023_0FA01458FB618DA8"/>
Jesus receive my Spirit:</HI> we receive Christ, and we receive the Spi∣rit of Christ; <HI>Now to as many as received him, to them gave he power, &amp;c.</HI> Joh. 1. 12. Christ receives our Spirits (then:) If we receive his Spirit now, he will receive our Spirits then; <HI>I will receive you to my self.</HI></P>
<Q>Doct. That the effectual Remembrance, that at Death Christ will receive our Souls unto Himself, is a Soveraign Preservative to quiet our Souls throughout all the Sufferings we meet with, either In the way of Truth, and For the way of Truth, during this life.</Q>
<P>You shall finde in <HI>Iob</HI> 19. 25. saith he, <HI>I know that my Re∣deemer liveth:</HI> He might say, I know my Estate is gone, and I see that my Friends are gone, and my Children be gone, and my Health and Strength is gone, and the Grave is ready for me; but what stayes <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>obs</HI> heart now? <HI>I know that my Redeemer lives.</HI> This is a living truth for a dying man; <HI>I know that my Redeemer lives, and that he shall stand in the latter day upon the earth, and I shall see him, &amp;c.</HI> This was now <HI>In the way of Truth,</HI> for you cannot say that <HI>Iob</HI> was persecuted <HI>For the way of Truth.</HI> But you shall finde in a way of suffering for the way of Truth, <HI>Phil.</HI> 1. 23. <HI>I desire to be dissolved, and to be with Christ:</HI> Having passed through many troubles, I would be out of the body and freed from the body of death; <HI>I desire to depart, and to be with Christ.</HI> 2. Cor. 5. 8. <HI>We are confident, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and present with the Lord.</HI> You must either be absent from the body, or absent from the Lord; it is an hard thing to be absent from the body, but not comparatively: <HI>We desire rather to be ab∣sent from the body, and present with the Lord: We shall meet the Lord, and shall ever be with the Lord.</HI> What is the use of this, 1 <HI>Thess,</HI> 4. 18. <HI>Comfort one another with these words:</HI> what are these Comforts? They are nothing but Promises; Promises rightly applied, these are the Comforts of the holy Ghost: they hold forth more good, then the affliction doth evil. If you would comfort one another, bring out the Promise, that is comfortable and seasonable. <HI>Comfort
<PB N="19" REF="000090_0024_0FA01459BAEECEA8"/>
one another:</HI> with what? <HI>with these words;</HI> for in them the Com∣forter doth come and apply comfort.</P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 1. Because hereby we are made fit for this rest, fit to be with Christ; that is, by our trouble, &amp; by this remembrance. Mixing this remembrance with our trouble, doth fit us for this place. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. 5. <HI>He that worketh us to the self-same thing, is God.</HI> For what thing? for our heavenly house, our <HI>house not made with hands:</HI> he that fits us for these things, is God. And thus doth he fit us by trouble, by these matters of groaning that do pass over us from day to day. This should be a great incouragement; <HI>There is a place prepared for you,</HI> but remember you must be fit for your place: you are not fit for your place, in that you are meerly Regenerate, but you must pass through such a measure of Obedience both active and passive that is appointed for you, that by this means <HI>you may be meet for the inheritance of the Saints in light.</HI> The place is fit for us already, but we are not fit for it as soon as we are Regenerate. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. he doth there instance in the troubles of the body, the grief of the outward man: we are burthened with our body, but all this while a fitting for our place. If you belong to God, he is working you <HI>to the self-same thing;</HI> be your trouble this or that (the Cholick, Palsie, Stone, or whatever) he is working us <HI>for the self-same thing:</HI> This is a great matter in our troubles, to consider that God by them is fitting us for our place in Heaven.</P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 2. From the Quality of the Undertaker, that hath un∣dertaken the reception of our Souls to himself; <HI>I will come, and receive you to my self.</HI> If it be so, let us <HI>that suffer according to the will of God</HI> (1 Pet. 4. 19.) <HI>commit the keeping of our Souls to him:</HI> you may boldly do it, he sends a fiery Chariot for <HI>Elijah;</HI> likely it was an Angel, <HI>He makes his Angels spirits, his Ministers a flame of fire,</HI> Heb. 1. 7. Christ hath his way to carry your Souls to Hea∣ven: you do not believe what a condition your Souls will be in, as soon as ever they are out of the body: do but think what a meet∣ing here is; but we believe not these things. As Christ, when he sent to his Disciples to comfort them, (<HI>Luke</HI> 24. 11.) they thought they were <HI>idle tales:</HI> so when we hear of these things, we look at them but as <HI>idle tales;</HI> but, saith Christ, <HI>I will come, and receive you to my self.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="000090_0025_0FA0146001A1B1B0"/>
<HI>Reas.</HI> 3. Taken from the Person we shall be with, namely, Christ. Phil. 1. 23. <HI>You shall be with Christ, which is best of all,</HI> or <HI>which is farre better:</HI> There is no better House then this Mansion, there is no better Presence then his Presence; therefore will might he say, <HI>I. is best of all,</HI> or <HI>farre better.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Instruction</HI> 1. Learn from hence, that the most and the greatest Communion that we have with Christ in this life, still leaves us in a condition of absence from Christ, compared with that Commu∣nion we shall have with him after death: So saith the Apostle, 2. Cor. 5. 8. <HI>We are willing to be absent from the body, and present with the Lord;</HI> ver. 6. <HI>for while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:</HI> It is a place of absence form the Lord, that is, compared with what we shall have after death. If you think of <HI>Paul,</HI> Who did enjoy Christ more then <HI>Paul</HI> did? Did not <HI>Paul</HI> enjoy Church-communion? Yes; but notwithstanding this was a place of <HI>absence from the Lord,</HI> compared with the society that by death he should be in. Was not <HI>Paul</HI> acquainted with any godly men? you know what he saith of <HI>Timothy;</HI> but yet (saith he) <HI>I am absent from mine own people.</HI> The word that is here translated [<HI>Absent</HI>] signifies <HI>Absence from his own people:</HI> he loved <HI>Timothy</HI> well, but he thinks <HI>the Spirits of just men made per∣fect,</HI> exceed the Spirit of <HI>Timothy:</HI> Here is no Companion that is like the Company there; here is no Communion will satisfie here. Where most of Christ is, it is best, but yet it is <HI>absence</HI> compara∣tively; <HI>We are absent from the Lord.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Instr.</HI> 2. The New man (the Believer) is never at rest till he is with Christ in his Mansion-house. If you never finde any such thing in you, but that, if you might have your desire, you would be here alwayes, believe it you have not this New man in you: this New man never is at rest, till it comes to Christ. It is true, there is weakness in the best, and unbelief may prevail too-too much, but I speak of this new Nature that is in these, and reigns in these that are Regenerate. You know how it is with those that love one another: after that <HI>Jacob</HI> knew what was become of <HI>Joseph,</HI> there was no staying of <HI>Jacob; Let me go and see him before I dye,</HI> Gen. 45,28. What was the reason of it? there was
<PB N="21" REF="000090_0026_0FA014614687FB58"/>
an intire love one unto another. You know how it is with those that do indeed love one another, that have been long absent one from another, they cannot rest until they meet: Was there any did ever love another, as the New man loves Christ? The New man loves him with a divine love, <HI>the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame,</HI> Cant 8. 6. There are some on earth that do long after Christ; there are those on earth that do desire after Heaven: and do any love another, as Jesus Christ loves the New man? There must be a meeting between these two Lovers; <HI>I will come, and receive you to my self.</HI> Mark how <HI>John</HI> concludes the <HI>Revelations,</HI> Chap. 22. ver. 21. <HI>Behold I come,</HI> saith Christ: <HI>He that testifieth of these things, saith, I come; Amen, even so come Lord I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sus.</HI> Here is a longing to be with Christ. In any of your quaeries concerning Christ, you are never at rest till you come to Heaven: it is the proper Being of the Sun to be in motion; this New man is a divine man, and his motion is still unto, and after Christ.</P>
<P><HI>Instruction</HI> 3. The death of the Believer, it is a reception of the Soul by Christ Jesus. Christ receiving of our Soules at Death, is an incouragement to strengthen us against the fear of Death. Are you affraid of going to your Mansion house? are you affraid of going to Christ? Mark what the Apostle saith, <HI>Phil.</HI> 1. 23. <HI>I desire to depart, and to be with Christ.</HI> The Greek word is a Marriners Phrase, and signifies as much as to set sayle from the shore: I desire my time were come to be loosed that I might go to my Mansion. There are three Cords or Bonds that do Intangle us, the loosing from which doth sweeten Death to us: 1. The Bond of the Cross; I desire to be dissolved, and loosed from the afflictions and miseries of this present life: This is in it's place a lawful thing to desire in Gods time. 2. There is a Bond of Corruption, the body of Death; this I desire to be loosed from: <HI>O <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this Death! Rom.</HI> 7. 24. There are pan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in the Best; But if you have the new man in you, you cannot bear them: There is Vain-glory there, and there is impatience there, and there is Envy there, and Unspiritualness, which the Believer cannot
<PB N="22" REF="000090_0027_0FA0146201547C10"/>
bear; I desire therefore to be loosed from the Body. It is said of one, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Mezentius.</HI></NOTE> that he would bind a dead Corpse to a living man, and so he would torture them. This new man is bound to a dead Corps: there is no part of the Understanding, Will, or Aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctions, throughout the whole man, but this dead Corpse is there. 3. There is the Cord of our absence from Christ: that he ex∣presseth, as if it did in an especial manner move with him to be <HI>with Christ, which is the best of all. Simeon</HI> speaking of death, <HI>Lord, now lettest thou thy Servant depart in peace, Luk.</HI> 2. 29. as if he should say, Give me my dismission (as we use to speak, from one Church to another: so here) from a Society Militant, to a Society Triumphant: So you see here he calls it but a dismission; <HI>it came to pass when the time was come that he should be received up, Luk,</HI> 9. 51. relating to his death: if you did but think that this were the great business when you dye, namely, the receiving of your Soules, you would not be troubled: you cannot give up your Soules into better hands. <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hn</HI> 5. 24. you shall there finde it is called a passage from one Room to another, he is passed from death to life: it is like a passing from one room into another. Look at death as in the Curse, and what more terrible? But look at it in the Promise, and it hath another kind of aspect. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15. 43. you see there it is compared to sowing; <HI>it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power.</HI> This is now with relation to the body, it is but sowing of it, it shall rise again, and that with ad∣vantage: you are not affraid of sowing your seed, that will bring a glad harvest. It is a going from those that are not our own people, to those that are our own people, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. 6,8. it may be you have a friend here, but it is not an ordinary thing to meet with a <HI>Jonathan</HI> here. It is but a going from them who are not our people, whom we cannot so fully close with; nay you cannot close with your own souls fully, while here; but you are going from those <HI>who are not your people,</HI> to those <HI>who are your people,</HI> where you shall find perfect closing with this new man; you are come to <HI>the spirits of just men ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> perfect.</HI> Would you see what <HI>Peter</HI> saith concern∣ing death, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 14. <HI>I must put off my tabernacle:</HI> it is a strange <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> he makes no more of it, then for <HI>Elijah</HI> to put off his

mantle. What a thing was it for <HI>Elijah</HI> to let his mantle fall, he gets him up into his Chariot and lets go his mantle: I speak this, that you may see what expressions the Scripture gives concerning death: <HI>O let my last end be like his!</HI> I tell you it is a lovely thing, <HI>Let me dye the death of the Righteous, let my last end be like his:</HI> I tell you there is another good in their last end, that the unbeleiver is not aware of. It is but a going out of one place to another. I have done with this, when I have minded you of that place, 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 4. 14. They sleep, and they sleep in Jesus: <HI>They also that sleep in Jesus shall God bring with him:</HI> you see two bodies lye by the wall, and they look both alike, but (believe it) they are not both alike in the Promise; if one be a Believer, and the other an Unbeliever, one is gone to this Mansion place, the other not.</P>
<P><HI>Instr.</HI> 4. The presence of Jesus is the place of blessedness: So saith Christ here, <HI>I will take you to my self, and you shall be where I am.</HI> We shall see him, we shall be inlightned by him, we shall be satisfied in him, and blessed with him.</P>
<P N="1">1. We shall see him: 1 <HI>Ioh.</HI> 3. 2. <HI>We shall see him as he is.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. We shall see him, so as to be <HI>inlightned by him.</HI> Psal. 36. 9. <HI>In thy Light we shall see light:</HI> They are marvellous Lights, that are in the place of Blessedness.</P>
<P N="3">3. We shall be <HI>satisfied in him.</HI> Psal. 17. 15. <HI>As for me, when I awake I shall be satisfied with thy likeness.</HI> A satisfaction there will be at our Dissolution, though more fully at the Resur∣rection.</P>
<P N="4">4. We shall be <HI>Blessed with him. Blessed are the pure in heart,</HI> (Mat. 5. 8.) <HI>for they shall see God.</HI> Then you that hear me, look to your hearts, for it is not whether you are rich or poor; but, <HI>Bles∣sed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</HI> But what is it to see God? <HI>I shall see my Redeemer,</HI> saith <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ob:</HI> and that is true, the eyes of our bodies may see the body of Christ; but <HI>you shall see God,</HI> you shall <HI>see him face to face,</HI> you shall <HI>see him as he is.</HI> I tell you, the soul of man is never at rest till it sees God. Some shall never see God &amp; therefore never be at rest; <HI>There is no peace, no rest to the wicked,</HI> Isa 57. 21. <HI>Saith my God.</HI> But now the soul it rests when it comes to <HI>see God:</HI>

He is such an Object, as nothing without him will satisfie our Souls: may be they may be pleased, as children with a Rattle, for a while here, but nor satisfied without him; therefore know it, there Souls of ours are more worth then we are apt to think of, prize them how you will.</P>
<P>Unto the <HI>seeing of God</HI> (to speak plainly) there are three things that are required:</P>

<P><HI>Exhort.</HI> 1. It is abundantly to incourage every Christian to constancy in the profession of the truth, notwithstanding all the suffering we may meet with, either <HI>in the way of truth,</HI> or <HI>for the way of truth.</HI> This is that which <HI>John</HI> makes use of, 1 <HI>Iohn</HI> 3. 2. <HI>We shall see him as he is;</HI> and, <HI>He that hath this hope to see God, purifieth himself, even as he is part, ver.</HI> 3. Do you say you have hope to see God? this is a very purifying meditation. Can you endure any impurity, and yet maintain this hope in you to see Christ? <HI>Acts</HI> 24. 15,16. mark there how it did work with him; <HI>And have hope towards God, which themselves also allow:</HI> I have hope that I shall see God, and that there is such a truth as the resurrection; <HI>here∣in do I exercise my self, to have alwayes a Conscience void of offence, both towards God and towards Man:</HI> they that are false to his truth, they shall not see him, that dye without Repentance of it: herein do I labour to keep alwayes a Conscience clear both towards God and man, that this may not hinder me from a sight of this Mansion: 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. 8,9. speaking to the same purpose, <HI>We desire to be with the Lord: wherefore we labour, that whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.</HI> Thus you see what this meditation doth call for: this makes a man or woman of a labouring spirit, it calls for adherence to the truth: And more particularly, consider then what it is to be a Christian in earnest, to be such a Christian as walks in that way, wherein they walk that have the Promise to go to Christ, when their Soules go out of the body; these are such as the eleven were, not such as <HI>Iuda<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> was; he went the other way, he went <HI>to his own place.</HI> You must be such Christians as the Apostles were, that is, such as do continue with Christ in the profession of his truth, that you may

be Conquerours in holding on in your Profession.</P>
<P N="2">2. Consider what you must expect while you are in your way; you must expect such troubles, as nothing will quiet you, but the exercise of Faith in Christ Jesus. Your hearts they will be as∣saulted, but <HI>let not your hearts be troubled:</HI> the Truth it will cause trouble to you, though you think of carrying of it never so in∣offensively, and amiably among m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n. Christ, by all his good carriage, could not reconcile those that hated the truth: Hence those that profess the truth, let them not think strange if they meet with trouble. <HI>Then</HI> (Acts 9. 31.) <HI>had the Churches rest:</HI> Other places have rest very frequently; but for the Churches, those that profess the Truth to have rest, is a special favour of God.</P>
<P N="3">3. Your troubles here, while you carry it with a Christian Spirit, they shall fit you for this blessed estate; as it is said 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5 5. [<HI>He that worketh us to the self-same thing.</HI>] You may think God means evil to you, when you meet with affliction and trouble; but, provided you are <HI>in the way of Truth,</HI> or be it <HI>For the way of Truth,</HI> that which God ayms at, is to fit you for your Mansion-place. Christ would fit us to be in the body, and he would fit us to go out of the body; <HI>He works us to the self-same thing.</HI> If you have a strong body, he would fit you for that bo∣dy to walk with him in that body. Saith <HI>Caleb,</HI> Josh. 14. 11. <HI>I have as strong a body, as in the day that Moses sent me.</HI> Now as it is a great matter to have such a body, so it is a great matter to walk with God in such a body: if you have an healthful body, he would fit you to walk with him in that body, that <HI>you may know how to possess your vessel in Sanctification and honour:</HI> not that your body should be the slave of filthy lusts. Suppose you have a sickly body, 2 Cor. 4. 16. <HI>Our outward man decayes, but our inward man is renewed day by day:</HI> and he <HI>worketh us to the self-same thing,</HI> by fitting us to go out of the body; <HI>Acts</HI> 20. 24. <HI>that I may finish my course with joy, and the Ministry that I have received.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Concurre with God in this scope of his Providence to you; he is fitting of you to walk with God. If he fit you to go

out of the body, or to be in the body, close with him, as the Patient closeth with the Physician; interpret the Changes that are upon you, of one nature or of another, interpret them as dispensations whereby God works to fit you to be with him in the body, or to go to him when you go out of the body. Let us work together with him; <HI>I did it to humble them, Deut.</HI> 8. 16. then close with him, and say, This is his end; and for that end joyn with him. You shall finde more trouble then rest, while you are <HI>In the way;</HI> you shall finde more rest then trouble, when you are at the <HI>end of your way.</HI> You that are lovers of truth, more then of the pleasures of Sin, you shall finde more trouble then rest while you are in the way; but when you are out of the body, you shall have full rest without any trouble: you shall have Truth enough, and Peace enough. That which is hard to gain now, is Union in the Truth; but then you shall have Union enough, and Truth enough: you shall finde Christ making good that truth to you, that <HI>He will come, and receive you to himself.</HI> When <HI>Noah</HI> put forth his hand, and received the Dove into the Ark, it was a welcome ease: so will it be to your Souls when they have been wearied with so many troubles, and Christ Jesus shall come, <HI>and receive you to himself,</HI> when your Souls go out of the body; for otherwise the Devil will be ready to receive them, and to carry them to Hell. Whither went <HI>Dives</HI> Soul when it went out of his body? you that are now in Pleasures, whither went <HI>Dives</HI> Soul? it is not said he was an Adulterer, or a Drunkard; but he was a man of Pleasures, [<HI>In thy life time then hadst thy good things,</HI> Luke 16. 25.] But what became of his Soul when it went out of the body? <HI>And being in Hell, he lift up his eyes in torments, &amp;c.</HI> ver. 23. <HI>Gen.</HI> 46. when <HI>Joseph</HI> received <HI>Jacob,</HI> and his Brethren, after so long an absence, judge what a contentment there was: <HI>Jacob</HI> fell upon <HI>Josephs</HI> neck, and <HI>Joseph</HI> fell upon <HI>Jacobs</HI> neck: but their embraces are not to be mentioned with the embraces of Christ and the Soul. <HI>Do good, that when you dye, the good you have done may receive you into everlasting habitations.

<HEAD>THE EVANGELICAL WORSHIPPER, Subjecting to the Prescription and Soveraignty of Scripture-patern. BEING THE THIRD SERMON: AND Preached on the LECTURE-DAY, APRIL II. 1663.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>Heb. 8. 5.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Who serve unto the Example and shadow of Heavenly things; as</HI> Moses <HI>was admonished of God, when he was about to make the Tabernacle: for see (saith he) that thou make all things ac∣cording to the patern shewed to thee in the Mount.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THis Verse illustrates the Argument mentioned in the foregoing words, from an adjunct, or accident ac∣companying the Legal Priest-hood: The Argument there used to prove that the Priest-hood of Christ excelled that priest-hood which was after the Order of <HI>Aaron,</HI> was, because they which were of that Priesthood ministred on Earth, but Christ ministreth in Heaven: He was a Minister of the true Tabernacle while he was on Earth, and he still officiates in his Priestly Office now he is in Heaven; the Tabernacle which they ministred in, was upon the Earth, and was made of earthly things, and it was a figure or shadow of heavenly things: he de∣clares that that Tabernacle was a worldly Tabernacle or Sanctuary,
<PB N="30" REF="000090_0035_0FA0146C4DE98DD0"/>
1. From the quality of it; it was onely <HI>a shadow,</HI> or example <HI>of heavenly things,</HI> and it was a type; but Christ was a Minister of the true Tabernacle. 2. It is declared from the certainty of it, for He saith this: But how doth that appear? It appears from a Divine Testimony; <HI>For see (saith he) that thou make all things according to the Patern shewed to thee in the Mount.</HI></P>
<P>For the opening of the words. First, we are to consider what these heavenly things are: They are called in Chap. 9. 11. <HI>Good things to come.</HI> In a word, it means Christ, with all his Be∣nefits; these are the <HI>Heavenly things,</HI> that the other were but <HI>Shadows of.</HI> Therefore it is truely said, that the Ceremonial Law holds forth Christ, <HI>i. e.</HI> it makes known the Gospel (being rightly understood) but after a Legal dispensation.</P>
<P>Secondly, it was <HI>a shadow of good things,</HI> i. e. it was a patern that did shadow out <HI>Heavenly things.</HI> God shewed <HI>Moses</HI> a Patern, or Type, in a Vision, according to which the Taber∣nacle was to be farmed, and <HI>Moses</HI> acts accordingly. The word translated [<HI>Patern</HI>] intends as much as a likeness, or example, or a figure. As for the Divine Testimony, you may see it in <HI>Exodus</HI> 25. 9. <HI>According to all that I shew thee, after the patern of the Tabernacle, and the patern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall ye make it.</HI> And in Chap. 39. this testimony is often given, that <HI>All things were done as the Lord had commanded Mo∣ses.</HI> But Christ was the Minister of another Tabernacle, <HI>i. e.</HI> of his Body, the true Tabernacle.</P>
<Q>Doct. Great care must be had in matters of Divine Worship, (or Divine Administrations) that all things proceed accord∣ing to the Prescript Word of God. Or, That all things be exactly corresponding to the Prescript of Gods Word, He∣brews 7. 14.</Q>
<P>For it is evident, that our Lord sprang out of <HI>Iudah,</HI> of which Tribe <HI>Moses</HI> spake nothing concerning the Priesthood. The Apostle thinks he argueth well, and conclusively, That Christ was not of the Levitical Order, because nothing was spo∣ken concerning it of that Tribe. This is a good Argument in
<PB N="31" REF="000090_0036_0FA0146D8AFE1A28"/>
Divinity to say, That there is nothing in Gods Word why you should act such or such a thing: it is not enough to say that there is nothing expresly against it; the truth is, there is enough against it, if there be nothing for it. The Tribe of <HI>Iudah</HI> must not med∣dle with the matters of the Priesthood: Why so? because <HI>Moses</HI> spake nothing of them in that respect: and in <HI>Exod.</HI> 25. 9. <HI>Moses</HI> himself was to act nothing that he found not in the Patern. <HI>Exod.</HI> 26. 30. <HI>And thou shalt rear up the Tabernacle according to the fashion thereof, which was shewed thee in the Mount:</HI> He must act nothing that he doth not finde in the Patern. It is true, <HI>David</HI> (for some just cause) made some alteration in the Worship of God; for the state of <HI>Temple-worship,</HI> compared with <HI>Tabernacle∣worship,</HI> did call for a change. But how did <HI>David</HI> proceed in it? 1 Chron. 28. 19. <HI>All this</HI> (saith <HI>David) the Lord made me un∣derstand in writing, by his hand upon me, even all the works of this patern:</HI> He made no alteration in Gods Worship, but it was also by a Patern given to him by God. And for <HI>Solomon,</HI> you finde that <HI>David</HI> gave him the Patern, <HI>ver.</HI> 11. to build the Temple according thereunto. And relating to Gospel-times, the time of the Mes∣sias, you have an eminent text in <HI>Ezek</HI> 43. 10,11. <HI>Thou Son of man, shew the house to the House of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities, and let them measure the patern; and if they be ashamed of all that they have done, shew them the form of the house, and the fashion, and the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms thereof, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 1. Because it is the acknowledgement of the Prerogative of Jesus Christ; I mean that he alone hath the honour to institute Divine Worship: He in truth was the Author of the Tabernacle, &amp; of the Temple and yet he was the Tabernacle, and the Temple, <HI>i. e.</HI> the true Tabernacle and Temple. The power of the Keyes, <HI>i. e.</HI> the instituted Worship under the Gospel, you shall finde Christ is the maker and disposer of those Keyes, <HI>Mat.</HI> 16. 19. It is not for man to make a Key to open Heaven, he will never be able to pick that lock. <HI>Ye shall reverence my Sanctuary</HI> (saith God, <HI>Levit.</HI> 26. 2.) and why so? <HI>I am the Lord:</HI> (make a pause here) <HI>i. e.</HI> it's no less then the Attribute of his Lordship that is demon∣strated
<PB N="32" REF="000090_0037_0FA0146F758435E8"/>
in the matters of his Worship: as for instance, <HI>Korah</HI> was very near unto the Priesthood, <HI>Numb.</HI> 16. 1. and yet inferiour to the Priesthood, (and it may be that was some tempta∣tion to him to be so near it, and yet inferiour to it) but he must not offer Incense, <HI>Numb.</HI> 16. 40. but the Priests, which are the Sons of <HI>Aaron,</HI> may: Why may not <HI>Korah?</HI> the reason is, <HI>I am the Lord,</HI> I will have this act to be matter of Divine Worship, and not another, and I will have this man to act, and not another; <HI>I am the Lord.</HI> Might not any man take a little perfume, and sprinkle it on the coals? No, God will institute what acts, and what persons he pleaseth. I have heard (I think) some say, that any man may adminster Baptism, or the Lords Supper; and I say it may be a Childe is able to do it: what then? But we must re∣member what God saith, <HI>I am the Lord;</HI> and he will be owned in his Institutions. <HI>Uzzah</HI> was a good man, yet he may not touch the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; why not? <HI>I am the Lord,</HI> 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 6. It is one of the holy Institutions of God, <HI>Ye shall all reverence my Sanctuary.</HI> Hence it is, that to the holy things of God, reverence is a great part of duty: and if this or that be Gods Worship, remember Gods Lordship is in his own Institutions, and he will make a difference as he pleaseth: not that <HI>Aaron</HI> or <HI>Moses</HI> are better then others in themselves, they may be worse, but God will have his Lordship appear in these his holy things. Therefore it is that we must be conscientious in our reverence of the holy things of God, even in regard of bodily reverence by comely gestures, for <HI>our bodyes are the Lords,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6. Hence [<HI>Sitting</HI>] is not a Prayer-gesture; it is true, if there be great weakness or infirmity of body, &amp;c. that may give an ex∣cuse for <HI>the Lord will have mercy,</HI> in case <HI>rather then Sacrifice.</HI> And therefore also it is that Christ stood up when he read the word, <HI>Luk.</HI> 4. 16. and in <HI>Neh.</HI> 8. 5. <HI>they stood up at the hearing of the Wordread.</HI> We should shew reverence at the holy things of God, because they are his Institutions, and <HI>he is the Lord.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 2. Because in Divine Worship we acknowledge God to be our Soveraign Lord, and that we owe unto him absolute Subje∣ction and Obedience, and we acknowledge our selves to be his ab∣solute Subjects. The act of Worship is an acknowledgement both
<PB N="33" REF="000090_0038_0FA0146F805BC430"/>
of his Soveraignty, and of our meanness: <HI>Who am I, that am but dust and ashes, that I should take upon me to speak unto the Lord?</HI> Gen. 18. In acts of Worship we must exalt Christ, and depress man. Many in these dayes are against Forms, but in the mean time let us not forget Worship. For Israel to wait upon a Rock, was a despicable thing to the Nations; to see so many thousands come and stand about the Rock was strange, but that Rock was Christ: this is nothing else but the acknowledgement of God, who will be known in his own way. And this let me say, Christ him∣self, that was not onely Man but God, attended the Ordinances while he was here on earth, and so did his Apostles: this is to shew the disevangelical spirit of those that do object against ex∣ternal Worship.</P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 3. Because Divine external Worship is a means of con∣ferring heavenly things. The Keyes of the Kingdome of Heaven open or shut Heaven, <HI>Mat.</HI> 16. 19. <HI>Naaman</HI> must know (if he be cured) whence the Cure comes; he must acknowledge the Waters of <HI>lord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n,</HI> and he must acknowledge the Prophet: God could have cured him without either, but he was not pleased so to do. You feed your Hens and Chickens, but you throw their meat upon the ground, and make them take it from thence: so God feeds us with heavenly food but we must receive it in a lowly manner. You can have no Faith to expect Gods blessing in any way but his own; any Institutions, so farre as they are Humane, you cannot have Faith for Gods blessing to go with them.</P>
<P><HI>Instructions.</HI> 1. The Ceremonial Law understood, teacheth Christ; the truths of Christ are laid up under the types of the Ce∣remonial Law. When you reade the Ceremonial Law, if you un∣derstood it, you would see Christ through it; as for instance, <HI>Heb.</HI> 9. the Tabernacle was a figure of Christs Body, and so was the Vail: <HI>Heb.</HI> 10. 20. when they went into the first Court, they re∣membred the Incarnation of the Messias, and so when they looked on the Vail, &amp;c. they who looked on these types, whose eyes were opened, they saw Christ. Reade <HI>Lev.</HI> 16. 15. compared with <HI>Heb.</HI> 9. 24. 26. As Christ shed his blood, and so entred into Heaven, so the High-priest slew the Sacrifice, and then entred into the holy of
<PB N="34" REF="000090_0039_0FA0147057BE0890"/>
holies. And the efficacy of the Merit of Christ, was figured in the incense: this is to let us see, how clearly we are taught the same truths above what they of old were, comparing our times with theirs.</P>
<P><HI>Instr.</HI> 2. It is the part of those who are Conscientious, to keep themselves unto Scripture-bounds in holy, or Church-admini∣strations. 2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 10. 13. the Apostle would have them walk by a line (it relates to the Graecian exercises, to which the Apostle doth delight to allude:) it comes to one with that which the Apostle doth elsewhere say, (<ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> 2. <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. 5.) <HI>He that striveth is not Crowned, except he strive lawfully.</HI> There is a line of motion to regulate all administrations, especially Church-administrations; there is a line that doth regulate the Eldership, and a line also to regulate the Brotherhood: so that all Church administrations, are to be carried on according to that line. This was <HI>Moses</HI> his charge; <HI>See thou make all things according to the patern;</HI> and do you think there is not as much Conscience to be made of it now under the Gospel, to make all things according to the patern, as in the dayes of the Legal dispensation? 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14. 40. <HI>Let all things be done according to Order:</HI> the case may be so, that though a thing be done, that is for the matter of it good, there may yet be more hurt in the disorder of it, then there is good in the doing of it. If we exercise our own Notions and Apprehensions in matters of Worship, this is Will-worship. <HI>Mat.</HI> 15. 9. <HI>In vain do they Wor∣ship me, teaching for Doctrines the traditions of men.</HI> Mark the op∣position [<HI>Me,</HI>] and [<HI>Men</HI>]: can mens traditions be an act of Divine Worship? No, its but Will-worship, <HI>Col.</HI> 2. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>3. there may be that which is plausible to man, yet it's but Will-worship; there may be parts, and excellencies, but if they are out of place, it is that which God will not bear with: <HI>Exod.</HI> 20. 25. <HI>He that lifts up his tool upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Altar hath polluted it:</HI> it is enough to pollute it, because it is a mans tool: we must not turn to the right hand nor to the left, but keep our way right on. The <HI>Corinthians</HI> turned to the left hand, when they would not Excommunicate the incestuous person; and they turned to the right hand, when they would not receive him in, being a penitent: it was an errour on the right hand,

<P><HI>Instr.</HI> 3. A Religious Worshipper, or a man truly religious, doth not rest in this, That externals do answer the Prescript Rule of the Word, without proceeding to internal Worship. You finde that God doth not onely bear testimony against our Worship, but also against hypocritical Worship. First, against our Worship, or our Administrations; that (as you see) is Will-worship, and it is vain Worship, all the Institutions of men are so; they are Will-wor∣ship, <HI>i. e.</HI> there is sin and defilement in them: we must not set our posts by Gods posts. But then suppose we are brought to external worship, doth God rest here? no: do you think that God liveth on goat's bloud? <HI>Psal.</HI> 50. 13. And hence also, <HI>Amos</HI> 5. 25. saith the Lord, <HI>you did not offer unto me your sacrifices during the space of fourty years.</HI> speaking of the time in the Wilderness: It is like there was a cessation, in respect of the condition that they were in; as who should say, then I can be without Sacrifices. <HI>Ier.</HI> 7. 22,23.

it ought indeed to be according to the Rule, but this may be, and yet as it is in <HI>Isai.</HI> 1. 13,14,15. <HI>Your Incense is an abomination, and your solemn meetings iniqui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, my soul hates them, saith the Lord, they are a trouble unto me, and when ye make many Prayers I will not hear them, your hands are full of blood, &amp;c.</HI> It would be a dreadful thing if God should say to any of us that are full of duties, and concerning our Sabbaths, Lords Supper, our Fasts, our Feasts, <HI>I am weary of your Worship, bring no more vain Oblations, &amp;c.</HI> God forbid that we should forget the internal part of worship, whilest we are exercised in the external. <HI>Amos</HI> 5. 21. <HI>I hate and despise your feasts, I will not smell in your solemn Assemblies.</HI> Look not onely to external regularity, but look we unto inward piety, lest God hate and despise our Worship. <HI>Joshua</HI> (saith God) <HI>Why lyest thou upon the ground? Chap.</HI> 7. 10,11. <HI>Israel hath sinned, and trans∣gressed my Covenant, &amp;c.</HI> we have been much in fastings, and in external duties many years, but what reformation is there? are we brought sny more unto the Rule in Church and State? I beseech you know, that God aimes at Obedience as the internal substantial part of his Worship.</P>
<P><HI>Instr.</HI> 4. That the external Order of the Gospel (Church-or∣der) is no other then the external Throne of Christ Jesus. Wor∣ship that is mixt, partly Divine, and partly Humane, this is so much defilement in Gods Worship; but when it is according to the Rule, that is Christs Throne. Satan hath his throne, that is where Antichrist reignes; and Christ hath his Throne, that is where his Institutions are in force: there Christ fits as Lord. If the Polity be according to the Gospel, Jesus Christ is there ac∣knowledged Lord, and there is never a Member but is a Subject: there must be an Order, and according to that Order there must be subjection: do you think it an easy thing to be subject to Order? Remember it was matter of tryal to those that-came out of Egypt, and through the Sea (as we have done) yet there were <HI>men of re∣nown</HI> that could not bear Church-Order. Let me tell you, it is a greater matter to be subject to Order, then to come over the Seas, or to endure the troubles of a Wilderness; many will bear a Prison, before they will endure the Government of Christ, and Gospel∣order in his Church.</P>

<HI>Use</HI> 2. Of Exhortation to us all (in our Churches especially) to sanctifie God according to this truth, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That our polity may be a Gospel-polity, and may be compleat according to the Scrip∣tures, answering fully the Word of God: this is the work of our generation, and the very work we engaged for into this Wilderness; this is the scope and end of it, that which is written upon the forehead of <HI>New-England,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>The compleat walking in the Faith of the Gospel, according to the Order of the Gospel.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. And for your direction; first, remember that we have the pa∣tern in the mount; I mean, we have the Scripture as a Rule, and you have the <HI>Platform of Church-Discipline</HI> given to you in way of Council, as the Confession of our Faith to this way of Church∣government: you know in what manner it was; that which (for the substance of it) ownes the cause Congregational: if any are departed from it, let them look to it, I know none of the Elders that have receded from it. It was given many years ago as the Confession of our Faith, to this Country, and to the World: it is distinct from the <HI>Episcopacy,</HI> and from the <HI>Presbyterian way,</HI> form the <HI>Morellian way,</HI> from that of <HI>Separatism:</HI> and it is for the sub∣stance of it precisely the way Congregational. And as <HI>David</HI> said to <HI>Solomon,</HI> 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 28. 10,11. <HI>I give unto thee the patern of the House of God, &amp;c.</HI> what God will do with us he knows best; <HI>David</HI> lived not to build the Temple himself, but he left the patern thereof to his Son <HI>Solomon:</HI> And so we have the patern, only this is complained of, that it is not practised, though we have had it many years ago; now practice is the end of Doctrine.</P>
<P N="2">2. Consider, that we are all concerned in this service, I mean in setting up the Throne of Christ. <HI>Moses</HI> is concerned, and it is his commendation that he was a man of God, who erected the Tabernacle, and set up the Worship of God according to the Pa∣tern in the Mount: and so <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Solomon</HI> &amp;c. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Solomon my Son, if thou doest hold here, the Lord will be with thee</HI> (and let the Churches look to it, we are all concerned herein, our Fidelity in this cause is our Crown; see that it be not taken from us.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is a matter of very good Policy; times of trouble &amp; danger may approach: and we read in <HI>Ezr.</HI> 3. 3. that <HI>they set the Altar upon

its Bases, for fear was upon them, because of the people of the land:</HI> one means to secure them from fear in time of trouble, was with the first to proceed with the things of Religion, and to be in good earnest to settle them. 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 28. 20,21. <HI>Do it</HI> (saith <HI>David</HI> unto <HI>Solomon) and the Lord God, even my God will be with thee:</HI> and not only so, but <HI>the priests, &amp; the princes, &amp; the people will be with thee, &amp;c.</HI> But when <HI>Solomon</HI> falls off from God's Worship, then ariseth against him the spirit of <HI>Hadad,</HI> and the spirit of <HI>Rezin,</HI> and the spirit of <HI>Ierob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>am</HI> &amp;c. 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 11. It is a great point of policy, in troublesome times, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the attending to the Cause of Religion, Without Order the Ark could not move in <HI>Davids</HI> time, but you see what trouble follows upon it; and Churches cannot like∣wise move, untill the Order of the Churches be proportionably settled: <HI>Haggai</HI> 1. 5,6. <HI>Now therefore saith the Lord of Hosts, con∣sider your wayes;</HI> when the Worship of God was neglected, things went ill with them; <HI>You have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough;</HI> and again <HI>ver.</HI> 7<SUP>th</SUP>. <HI>Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, consider your wayes:</HI> and in <HI>Chap.</HI> second, they do hearken to him, the Lord stirred up the spirit of <HI>Zerubbabel,</HI> and <HI>Josuah,</HI> and from the time that they set themselves about the work of the Lord, all things went well with them. How farre the drought, and the last years and other troubles are here considerable, refer∣ring to our selves, let the Scripture be the interpreter. The mat∣ters of outward prosperity have much dependance upon the car∣rying on the cause of Religion, and that according to the Order of the Gospel, or by the Scripture-patern; our safety lies in keeping there, not turning to the right hand, nor turning to the left hand. In <HI>Exod.</HI> 39. you have it mentioned about ten times in that Chapter in way of Commendation, that what was done was so <HI>according as the Lord had Commanded Moses.</HI> Let this stand with us I beseech you (beloved) that for the motion of Elders, of Brethren, of Councils, of Magistrates, of Churches, settle the same as the Lord hath Commanded, <HI>i. e.</HI> according to Scripture-pre∣script and patern; we are then a safe People.</P>
