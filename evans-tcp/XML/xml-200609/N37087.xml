<STAGE>Mary enters, lifts up a tambour frame which appears to have been thrown down, picks up the span∣gles, silks, &amp;c,—She speaks.</STAGE>
<P>SO Miss Juliet has been here, I see!—What put her into a rage with her tambour, I wonder?—Oh! I see, this rose-bud does not look well, so down it went, I'll warrant it, and here lie the span∣gles and twist thrown all over the floor. For my part, I wonder the

<SPEAKER>Mary.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Miss, not since breakfast.</P>

<SPEAKER>Paulina.</SPEAKER>
<P>I left her here at her tambour frame—She said she would work while I read to her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mary.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, Miss, but some∣thing has gone wrong since that.—Here I found the frame, and there lay the silks—Truly, I'm glad I was not here, they'd have been thrown at my head.</P>

<P>Perhaps she is gone to her own room, I'll seek her; if she comes there in the mean time, Mary tell her I am up stairs.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mary.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know, Ma'am, not I, she is in one of her passions to-day; every thing goes wrong with her; she was ready to fight with the looking-glass, while I dressed her this morning, and I don't know how many pinches I got for not being quick enough to please her.</P>

<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I'm a going, so miss asked me to play wi' she, for she said his honour was gone out and Madam Selwyn wa'nt up, and Master Charles was gone to school, and Miss Paulina was up stairs, and she did not know what to do wi' herself.</P>

<P>Ah! You do not know half how naughty I have been: I pinched Mary, I beat Fanny Wood!—What is it makes me so wicked, Paulina? I always know when I am so, and I am unhappy, then I fret, and do wrong again.</P>

<P>I can easily conceive

all that, you are greatly to be piti∣ed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juliet.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you are the only person (except my father) who e∣ver speaks to me as if I had com∣mon sense!—Mary shrugs up her shoulders and leaves me as soon as she can.—Mrs. Selwyn laughs at me and treats me like a baby. It was but just now she bade me <HI>"look how my doll stared at me!"</HI> And that put me into such a pas∣sion, that I threw my doll across the room.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paulina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly Mrs. Sel∣wyn does not treat you properly, but that does not justify you. You are now, my dear, more than twelve years old; at that age, though children, we are no longer babies, but you do not seek to improve yourself. You read, indeed, be∣cause you love reading, but not
<PB N="19" REF="048579_0020_1025A1A9A84F03F8"/>
with a steady view to your own improvement, and almost all the remainder of your time is spent in dressing your doll and playing with Fanny Wood, who is too ignorant to be a proper companion for you; thus you tempt others to treat you like a baby.—I do not offend you?</P>

<P>No, no,—I like to hear you because you speak to me gently, and I feel what you say. Pray, dear Paulina, tell me what I must do to be like you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paulina.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Juliet, I wish you a better example;—if you were with us, mama would soon teach you to be all your friends could wish.—But Juliet, with the understanding nature has given you, you may do much for yourself. In the words of a very great author I will tell you that
<Q><PB N="20" REF="048579_0021_1025A1ABF67669D0"/>
<L>—"There is no soul</L>
<L>More able to direct you than yourself.</L>
<L>If with the sap of Reason you would quench</L>
<L>Or but allay the Fire of Passion!"—</L></Q></P>
<P>Read more, and reflect—When∣ever you find yourself getting an∣gry leave the cause of your dis∣pleasure, take a book which amu∣ses you, and read till you find your∣self calm and easy. Struggle with your violent passions, and think to what dreadful consequences they will lead if you indulge them.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juliet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Consequences!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paulina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my dear cousin, I know not to what an excess they may transport you in time, if they are not now opposed.—My mother told me, the other day, she had just read the history of a man, who, when a boy, squeezed his squirrel to death
<PB N="21" REF="048579_0022_1025A1AE4EE90828"/>
as you did your bird, and when he grew up, after various crimes, be∣ing angry with his wife, his child, who was in her arms, happened to cry while he was speaking and, in a fit of passion, he laid his hand on it, and strangled it in a moment!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Juliet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! Heaven, how shocking; do you think it <HI>possible,</HI> Paulina, do you think it <HI>possible</HI> I should ever do so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paulina.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is impossible to say to what extravagance passion may lead!—But yesterday you would have detested the idea of injuring your bird—and are we not told in the Bible, that when the Prophet foretold to Hazael <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sec 8th Chapter of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Book of Kings.</NOTE> the miseries he would bring on his country, and the cruelties of which he would be

daughter you loved so tenderly!—Wretched girl!—Why do I ever, for a moment, forget the character which my father drew of my mother when he gave me this picture,—"Be like your mo∣ther, my Juliet; she was mild and gentle to all, she was beloved by every one who knew her! her dy∣ing wish was, that you might be virtuous!—My child, be worthy of your mother!—Yes, those were exactly his words. Ah! how little do I fulfil her wishes!—I, who ill-treat the servant to whose care she intrusted my infancy—Who a∣buse a poor child whose situation should make me pity her!—I whom every body hates!—Torn by contrary feelings!—Capable of knowing when I do wrong, yet yielding to the next temptation.—In spite of my faults, am I not to be pitied?</P>

<P>Miss Juliet seems very unhappy to-day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paulina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, she has naturally a strong sense of what is right; she feels that she is wrong, and of course is unhappy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mary.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot help loving her, though she is sometimes so much out of the way. She was a sweet child before she grew so passionate, and she has a great deal of good about her still. How my poor lady would have grieved had she lived to see her so head-strong.</P>

<SPEAKER>Paulina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Had it pleased Hea∣ven to spare Mrs. Beecher, Juliet would probably have been a very

different character; she has an ad∣mirable understanding, but she is ill educated.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mary.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true, indeed, miss. I take the liberty of speak∣ing to you because you know how I love all this family, and that I have lived in it long enough to know something about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paulina.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Mary, you may speak to me without fear; I know your attachment to your late lady and all that belonged to her.</P>

<SPEAKER>Paulina.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true indeed.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mary.</SPEAKER>
<P>She sets her no example but laziness, and she teazes her out of her wits;—if you had but heard her this morning—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paulina.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see it with pain. She has no command over my cou∣sin, because she puts herself on a le∣vel with her by mean teazing and raillery;—a passionate temper was never mended by irritation.—By the way, I don't much like this scheme of playing with Charles; Juliet and he always quarrel, and I am afraid he will overthrow all her good resolutions. I mean to speak to my uncle, to-night, about Mrs.
