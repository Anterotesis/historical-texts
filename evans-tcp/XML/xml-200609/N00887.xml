<L>The <HI>flame,</HI> the <HI>sparks, light, heat,</HI> and <HI>motion,</HI></L>
<L>Are <HI>Metamorphosed</HI> to <HI>Devotion.</HI></L>

<HEAD>THE INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>ONE of the <HI>Best</HI> Things, that can be done for other men, by any man, who would make it his Business to Do <HI>Good</HI> unto all, is to suggest and supply Good Thoughts unto them. Tho it may be disputed, whether this be the <HI>First Proposition,</HI> whereof any man can be certain, as a New <HI>Philosophy</HI> has taught us, <HI>I think, therefore I am;</HI> yet it is no <HI>New Divinity</HI> to teach, that <HI>As Men Think, so they are.</HI> That Noble Faculty of <HI>Thinking,</HI> wherewith a man is enabled, and enobled above the <HI>Beasts of the Field,</HI> being well or ill employ'd, will either turn men into <HI>Fellows</HI> for <HI>Angels,</HI> or make men worse <HI>than the Beasts that perish.</HI> The Infinite <HI>Perfections</HI> of God, the Wonderful <HI>Mysteries</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, the amazing <HI>Circumstances</HI> of the Future State, the various <HI>Preparations</HI> of men in this world, and other <HI>Circumstances</HI> referring to that <HI>State;</HI> the Il∣lustrious <HI>Operations</HI> of the Almighty both in Creation, and in Government; and His various <HI>Dispensations</HI> towards our Selves in
<PB N="8" REF="001067_0008_0FAEF2381DF77E58"/>
particular; such things as these, are most pro∣per, and worthy, and useful for a Rational and a Renewed Soul to <HI>Think</HI> upon. And a man full of <HI>Good,</HI> and <HI>Wise,</HI> and <HI>Right Thoughts</HI> upon these <HI>Great Themes,</HI> will be a <HI>Good man,</HI> and furnished for the Doing of much <HI>Good</HI> unto many others.</P>
<P>Meditation is therefore a Duty of so much Evidence and Consequence in <HI>Christia∣nity,</HI> that they can be no <HI>Christians,</HI> nor ac∣quainted in the least measure with the Di∣vine Oracles, who do not confess their Obli∣gations unto it: And yet it must be confes∣sed, That one grand cause why <HI>Christianity</HI> so much Languishes, is because that so few <HI>Chri∣stains</HI> duly practice it. Our Bible very fre∣quently commends unto us, Consideration, and a <HI>Meditating</HI> on <HI>God,</HI> and on His <HI>Laws:</HI> And thro' the want of this <HI>Meditation</HI> it is that all the <HI>Ordinances</HI> and all the <HI>Providences</HI> of God, are so ineffectual unto the most of men, and they continue so much without <HI>Life,</HI> and <HI>Light,</HI> and <HI>Peace</HI> all their dayes, and at last perish among those who do not <HI>Consi∣der their Latter End.</HI></P>
<P>One main Objection, which the <HI>Slothful</HI> Hearts of men make (tho' indeed their <HI>Sloth fulness</HI> be the main Objection!) against the Exercise of Meditation, is, their Ignorance of a good <HI>Method,</HI> for the Exercise. Now for a more Fired meditation, there is
<PB N="9" REF="001067_0009_0FAEF23967E0FFE8"/>
room in Truth for a vast variety of <HI>Method.</HI> For a <HI>Rumination</HI> on the <HI>Word</HI> of God, after the <HI>Reading</HI> or the <HI>Hearing</HI> of it, (which if we use not, what sort of <HI>Creatures</HI> are we?) there needs no other <HI>Method,</HI> but only that of the <HI>Word</HI> it self, which we have <HI>Read</HI> or <HI>Heard.</HI> But then there is a further <HI>Meditati∣on,</HI> for which a Christian should now and then <HI>Retire,</HI> that he may therein Enjoy a glorious Conversation with the <HI>God of the Spi∣rits of all Flesh:</HI> and there is one <HI>General Rule,</HI> to be offered about our proceeding in it. That is This; Let the <HI>Meditation</HI> be sure to consist of <HI>Two Parts:</HI> Let the first part be, to <HI>Inform</HI> our selves, and let the second part be to <HI>Affect</HI> our selves. In the first part, of our <HI>Medi∣tation,</HI> we may either Handle a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ert, or we may Answer a Case, in both of which, the <HI>Method</HI> is only, to speak unto it as well as we can; or else we may Discourse on a thing, whereon if we would manage our Discourse to purpose, we may observe, In the first place. The nature, (or Definition) of the Thing; and the Titles which the Scripture puts up∣on it: Next the Destribution of the Thing; Thirdly, the Causes of it; Fourthly, the effects of it; Fifthly, the Subjects of it; Sixthly, the Adjuncts of it; Seventhly, the Opposites of it; &amp; Eighthly, the Compari∣sons of it. In the Second Part of our <HI>Meditation,</HI> Let there be always these three
<PB N="10" REF="001067_0010_0FAEF239F4A3C8C8"/>
Steps First, An Examination, of our own <HI>Hearts,</HI> and <HI>Lives,</HI> relating to what we are upon: Secondly, An Expostulation with our selves to Quicken our Better Conduct; Thirdly, A Resolution of a Better Conduct in certain special Instances of Obedience. Let numberless <HI>Ejaculations</HI> be intermixed through∣out the whole Exercise; &amp; then let all Expire in a more <HI>Set Prayer,</HI> for such <HI>Graces</HI> of Heaven, as may be most agreeable to our <HI>Meditation.</HI></P>
<P>A Christian, that would conscientiously maintain a course of such <HI>Meditation,</HI> [Sup∣pose, for the most part, a Quarter of an Hour, or more, every Evening,] would find incredible Advantages arising from it. The Advantages would be such, that from a sense of them, I remember with what a <HI>Pathos,</HI> the famous Dr. <HI>Hall</HI> concludes his Exhortation of his Reader to the chearful practice of it; <HI>Let him Curse me upon his Death Bed</HI> (says he) <HI>if looking back from thence, to the bestowing of his former times, he acknowledge not these Hours, placed the most happily in his whole Life; if he then wish not, he had worn out more Dayes in so profitable and Heavenly a work.</HI></P>
<P>But then there is another sort of more Transient Meditation, wherein the Christi∣an that shall accustome himself unto it, will find a <HI>Lasting Satisfaction.</HI> All the <HI>Creatures of</HI> God about us, are so many <HI>Preachers</HI> from God unto us: and there is <HI>no Speech nor Lan∣guage,
<PB N="11" REF="001067_0011_0FAEF23A8B22A1B8"/>
where their voice</HI> might not be <HI>heard,</HI> if men who <HI>have Ears to bear,</HI> would but <HI>hear it.</HI> As there are <HI>Footsteps</HI> of the Divine <HI>Power,</HI> and <HI>Wisdom,</HI> and <HI>Goodness,</HI> to be seen upon all the Creatures, <HI>Praesentemque docet quaelibet Herb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Deum;</HI> so there are also Numberless Lessons of <HI>Morality,</HI> which by the Help of the <HI>Analo∣gy</HI> between the <HI>Natural</HI> and <HI>Spiritual</HI> World, (that, if we may use a Jewish phrase, are <HI>both Sealed with the same Seal,)</HI> we may learn from them. That passage of the Psalmist. Psal.119. 99. <HI>I have more understanding than all my Teachers, for thy Testimonies are my Medita∣tion:</HI> I remember, in the <HI>Pirke Avoth,</HI> one <HI>Ben Zoma</HI> so reads it, <HI>I learn understanding from all my Teachers.</HI> Truly, we have a world of <HI>Teachers</HI> about us; and if we were duly dispo∣sed unto <HI>Meditation</HI> on the <HI>Testimonies</HI> of God, it would be a Delight unto us, to be <HI>Learning understanding from them all.</HI> To fetch excel∣lent, and enriching <HI>Instructions</HI> out of the <HI>Creatures,</HI> that surround us, is most certainly one of the <HI>Highest Uses</HI> that we can put them unto; Yea, we are in a inexpressible man∣ner, the <HI>Candidates</HI> of the <HI>World to come,</HI> when we put the <HI>Creatures</HI> unto such <HI>Blessed Uses:</HI> And we have this <HI>Liberty of the Sons of God,</HI> that whoever be the <HI>Possessors</HI> of the <HI>Creatures,</HI> we may even without asking the <HI>Owners leave,</HI> or breaking the <HI>Eighth Commandment,</HI> thus <HI>use</HI> all that we <HI>see,</HI> and make it perhaps a thou∣sand
<PB N="12" REF="001067_0012_0FAEF23B69A35CE0"/>
times more serviceable unto us, than it is unto him that <HI>possesses</HI> it. It can't but be a great <HI>Sign,</HI> and <HI>Cause,</HI> and <HI>Fruit</HI> of <HI>Spiritual Mindedness</HI> in a Christian, to have a mind set upon <HI>Spiritualizing</HI> the most <HI>Earthly Objects</HI> that are before him: And if it <HI>Require</HI> not, yet it will <HI>Produce,</HI> not only <HI>Spirituality,</HI> but also <HI>Ingenuity,</HI> more than a little, thus to set all the <HI>Creatures</HI> of God on speaking unto us. <HI>Truly the Light is sweet;</HI> but usually a <HI>Ray</HI> of <HI>Light</HI> is much the <HI>Sweeter,</HI> for descending from Heaven unto us, in some <HI>Earthly Gar∣ments</HI> of <HI>Similitude.</HI> And if also we may be Foolishly Impatient at the <HI>Reproofs</HI> of our Neighbours, and by that Impatience perhaps may discourage them from doing us the <HI>kind∣ness</HI> of their <HI>wise Reproofs,</HI> we may now obtain those to <HI>Reprove</HI> us, that cannot <HI>Offend</HI> us. What an admirable, what a profitable Chy∣mistry, Syrs, have we now before us! A <HI>Chymistry,</HI> by which we may turn the mean∣nest Objects whatsoever, into what is far <HI>better than Gold, than much fine Gold!</HI> And <HI>for</HI> this <HI>Chy∣mistry,</HI> we have indeed one singular Advantage; That <HI>no Employment, no Company, no Place,</HI> need hinder us from it. We may any where, every where, Apply our selves unto it; and especially in the little <HI>Fragments of Time,</HI> that intervene between our more <HI>Stated Businesses.</HI> There will also be this very notable of it. That when-ever we have been at the pains to
<PB N="13" REF="001067_0013_0FAEF23C08434BA0"/>
make any Occasional Reflections on any thing, there are not only <HI>Good Thoughts</HI> for the present raised in us, but the <HI>Sight</HI> of those Things upon any occasion afterwards, will be ready to raise the same <HI>Good Thoughts</HI> again, and make our <HI>mind,</HI> for the <HI>continual Feast</HI> of it, as that of the <HI>Righteous</HI> is: For, <HI>Anima Justi Caelum est.</HI> Let no man be so vainly Impertinent, as to deride the <HI>Art,</HI> (&amp; <HI>Heart,</HI>) of making these Occasional Reflections. We have not only the Writings of the In∣comparable <HI>Robert Boyl,</HI> of Sr. <HI>William Wal∣ler,</HI> of Dr. <HI>Spurstow,</HI> and other persons of the <HI>finest Heart strings,</HI> recommending this <HI>Art</HI> un∣to us; but we have above all the most unex∣ceptionable Example of our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, to recommend it. Our Glo∣rious Lord Jesus Christ; when He saw a <HI>Vine,</HI> or a <HI>Field,</HI> or the <HI>Bread</HI> on the <HI>Table,</HI> or a stately <HI>House,</HI> or but an <HI>Hen and Chickens,</HI> His Holy Soul presently Sally'd forth to some Occasi∣onal Reflections thereupon, which had much of <HI>Admonition</HI> in them. To <HI>abound in these works of the Lord,</HI> will be no small <HI>Conformity</HI> to our most <HI>Exemplary Saviour:</HI> and it will therewithal most gloriously transfer this World, from the <HI>First,</HI> unto that <HI>Second Adam.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Method</HI> of proceeding in our Occasi∣onal Reflections, needs not be tied up unto many strict <HI>Rules</HI> about it. I remember, <HI>Hu∣go de Sancto Victore</HI> tells us, That there is a <HI>Three fold Voice</HI> of all the <HI>Creatures</HI> unto us,
<PB N="14" REF="001067_0014_0FAEF23CF501B3C0"/>
<HI>Accipe, Redde, Fuge.</HI> All <HI>Creatures</HI> may put us, in mind, first of something that we do Re∣ceive of God, in them; next, of something that we should Return to God for them; and thirdly, of something that we should Avoid, both of <HI>Transgression</HI> in them, and so of <HI>Punishment</HI> from them. And it were a very sutiable <HI>Method of Thinking,</HI> to touch upon each of those <HI>Three Heads</HI> in our Occa∣sional Reflections Or at lest, we may do well to oblige our selves unto the forming of a certain <HI>Triangle</HI> in them, with first, Going <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to observe the <HI>properties</HI> of the <HI>Creatures</HI> themselves; then Coming back to Advise our selves, with <HI>Instructions</HI> brought from them; and Lastly, Darting up to Him that Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>teth in the Heavens, our <HI>Petitions,</HI> for such Compassion and Assistance, so we now see we need.</P>
<P>Behold, Reader, a Book of Occasional Reflections, all made upon one of those <HI>Creatures,</HI> that we have daily before us: And if <HI>one</HI> of them, could afford so many <HI>Good Thoughts,</HI> unto one of so <HI>dull,</HI> and so <HI>vain</HI> a mind, as that which the Author of this Book, has to complain of (and yet <HI>he himself</HI> now finds, it might have easily afforded him as <HI>many more!</HI>) What an Immense Treasure of <HI>Good Thoughts</HI> might we find in all the rest?

<P>The <HI>Time</HI> of our Lords being Arraign'd, and Condemn'd, for us, had this Remark up∣on it; <HI>It was Cold.</HI> May that Circumstance add some <HI>warmth</HI> unto our Meditations on the Sufferings of our Lord. When we Re∣member, that the Agonies which our Lord in a <HI>Cold Night</HI> Endured for us, were such as notwithstanding His then Lying on the <HI>Cold Ground,</HI> threw Him into a bloody <HI>Sweat,</HI> it may well make us cry out, <HI>Lord, what means the Heat of this Anger?</HI> And beholding the <HI>Love</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ unto us, in these His direful <HI>Agonies,</HI> we must acknow∣ledge, <HI>The Coals of this Love, were Coals of Fire, having a most vehement Flame.</HI> What a deplo∣rable Thing is it, that a Disciple, who had newly seen these <HI>Agonies</HI> of his Lords <HI>Love</HI> unto Him, should when <HI>Warming himself by a Fire of Coals,</HI> in that very Night, find his own <HI>Love</HI> unto his Lord so <HI>Cold,</HI> as to <HI>Deny</HI> Him!</P>
<P>That this Time should be so <HI>Cold,</HI> may be perhaps by some a little wondred at, because the <HI>Spring</HI> was now advancing; the month of <HI>March</HI> was now begun▪ the <HI>Harvest</HI> in that

warm Climate was at hand. Our <HI>Biddulph,</HI> a famous English Traveller being in <HI>Jerusa∣lem,</HI> at this very Time of the year, found the <HI>Day</HI> so hot, that he wondred how <HI>Peter</HI> could now be so <HI>Cold,</HI> as to creep unto the <HI>Fire side;</HI> but when the <HI>Night</HI> arrived, he found such misty, damp and chill <HI>Dews</HI> fall, as resolved his Doubt; for it was very <HI>Cold</HI> indeed. And the Jewish Rabbi's, in some of their <HI>Canons,</HI> do suppose <HI>Frost</HI> and <HI>Snow</HI> sometimes happening, at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oming in of <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>san,</HI> a little before the <HI>Passover.</HI> Tis true, the Greek word here used for <HI>Cold,</HI> is used in profane Authors, to signifie the Intensest <HI>cold</HI> of the <HI>Winter;</HI> but here, if it signify no other than the wet <HI>cold</HI> of the <HI>AEquinoctial Nights,</HI> that was <HI>cold</HI> enough, to call for a <HI>Fire</HI> among men that valued their <HI>Health;</HI> And <HI>Austin</HI> therefore gives this Account of it, <HI>Non Hyems erat, et tamen Frigus erat, quale solet etiam aequinoctio verno aliquan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o contingere.</HI></P>
<P>It was one pungent Article, in the Suffer∣ings of our Lord, That He was <HI>Deny'd</HI> and Reproach'd by one of His own <HI>Disciples;</HI> even by a <HI>Peter,</HI> one of the most considerable a∣mong all His <HI>Disciples.</HI> The <HI>First Adam</HI> Sinn'd, by <HI>Denying</HI> of <HI>God;</HI> the <HI>Second Adam</HI> Suffer'd, by being <HI>Denyed</HI> of <HI>man.</HI> And it seems, one circumstance which led <HI>Peter</HI> unto this Transgression, of <HI>Denying</HI> his Lord, was the occasion, which the <HI>Cold</HI> gave him, to <HI>warm himself</HI> among those that were no Friends unto his Lord.</P>

<P>The Denyal of the Lord JESUS CHRIST by <HI>Peter,</HI> is Reported by all the <HI>Four</HI> Evange∣lists, among the <HI>Sufferings</HI> of our Lord. For indeed the <HI>Sufferings</HI> of our Lord thereby, were not a little aggravated: That one, who should have appeared as a witness to the <HI>In∣nocency</HI> of his Lord, should now so Desert Him, and so Deny Him, and so Adjure Him.
<PB N="21" REF="001067_0021_0FAEF2445E4CA720"/>
No doubt, it made the Enemies of our Lord, the more to insult over Him, and flout, <HI>See how bravely this Doctor hath instructed his Dis∣ciples!</HI> This doubtless hardened those Enemies in what they were about: And our Lord o∣ver hearing the speeches of <HI>Peter,</HI> therefore look'd back with inexpressible <HI>Grief</HI> upon him. In the mean Time, sit still with admiration at the <HI>Flaming Love</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ. He was now <HI>Suffering</HI> for them that were at this Time <HI>Sinning.</HI> Tho' our Lord were sen∣sible, that <HI>Peter</HI> were now <HI>Denying</HI> of Him, yet He would not give over the work of <HI>Dy∣ing</HI> for <HI>Peter,</HI> to save <HI>Peter</HI> from the Sin of his <HI>Denyal,</HI> that <HI>Peter</HI> might not be <HI>Deny'd</HI> by the merciful God of Heaven, that the plagues which <HI>Peter</HI> was wickedly wishing to himself might not come upon him, according to his wicked wishes. Behold, Syrs, Behold, a <HI>Love</HI> the <HI>Flames</HI> whereof are more ardent, than those at which you would now <HI>warm</HI> your selves. But I am very prone to suspect, that there was a further special Design of all the Evangelists, in reporting <HI>Peters</HI> Denyal of the Lord; and I believe <HI>Peter</HI> himself did, for that among other causes, desire every one of them, and <HI>Mark</HI> above the rest, that they would particularly tell the Story of his mis∣carriage in their Gospels. Tis This; <HI>Peters Denying</HI> of our Lord, gives an irrefragable and ungainsayable <HI>Demonstration,</HI> to the <HI>Truth</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="001067_0022_0FAEF2452B4F6AE8"/>
of what he asserted afterwards in <HI>witnessing</HI> for our Lord. By <HI>Peters Denying</HI> our Lord' before He <HI>Dyed,</HI> there is produced an irresisti∣ble proof of the <HI>Truth</HI> in his Testimony that our Lord <HI>Rose</HI> from the <HI>Dead.</HI> Had our Lord continued in the State of <HI>Death,</HI> you may be sure, <HI>Peter</HI> would have persisted in his <HI>Denial</HI> of Him. If our Lord had been found an <HI>Impostor,</HI> by His remaining under the Bands of <HI>Death, Peter</HI> having thus <HI>Deny'd</HI> Him, would have gone on to <HI>Deny</HI> Him, and Re∣vile Him all his dayes. But now, instead of This; you have this very <HI>Peter</HI> afterwards writing two <HI>Epistles,</HI> and Preaching more than two thousand <HI>Sermons,</HI> and Exposing himself to more than ten thousand <HI>Torments,</HI> that he might assure the world, of his Lords <HI>Resurre∣ction from the Dead.</HI> When <HI>Peter</HI> went about every where commending and proclaiming, and adoring his Dearest JESUS, as the <HI>Mes∣siah</HI> of God, it was a mighty Confirmation to the Truth of his Testimony, to Remem∣ber, <HI>This is the man, who once Deny'd and Fore∣swore that JESUS, whom he now so magnifies!</HI> Thus our Incontestable Religion, like the <HI>Fire</HI> before you, will fetch <HI>Fuel</HI> and <HI>Support</HI> from every thing.

<P>The Narrative of this unhappy Business,
<PB N="23" REF="001067_0023_0FAEF245C6A2AB60"/>
the <HI>Denyal</HI> of our Lord, by <HI>Peter,</HI> is given us by the Four Evangelists, with some variety. They all reckon up <HI>Three</HI> several Times of <HI>Peters Denying</HI> the Lord; and the first of the <HI>Three</HI> which was on the challenge of a <HI>Damosel,</HI> is very variously described. The Reconcilation is easy: Several Speeches were uttered by the <HI>Damosel</HI> unto <HI>Peter,</HI> and about him; and <HI>Peter</HI> made several Answers, whereof one of the Gospels does Relate one, and Another, another. The <HI>Damosel</HI> first says to the Standers by, (as <HI>Luke</HI> hath it,) <HI>This man also was with Him;</HI> And then turning to <HI>Peter,</HI> she says (as <HI>John</HI> hath it,) <HI>Art not thou one of this mans Dis∣ciples?</HI> Whereupon she peremptorily affirms, that she had seen <HI>Peter</HI> with Him, saying, (as <HI>Matthew</HI> and <HI>Mark</HI> have it,) <HI>Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.</HI> This drew out the several Answers of <HI>Peter,</HI> which the E∣vangelists have severally Recorded; All which together make up the <HI>First</HI> Action of <HI>Peter</HI> in <HI>Denying</HI> his Lord; and <HI>That</HI> where with our Discourse is now more im∣mediately concerned. All this occurr'd, at <HI>Peters</HI> first coming to the <HI>Fire side.</HI></P>
<P>Now, tho' we should be by the <HI>Fire side,</HI> where the <HI>Cold</HI> would not make us to <HI>shake,</HI> yet it might make us even <HI>Shake,</HI> to consi∣der the Horror of the Fact by <HI>Peter</HI> there

committed. There were horrible Aggrava∣tions of it!</P>
<P>For a <HI>Peter,</HI> to Deny his Lord! A <HI>Peter,</HI> Who was a Disciple, yea, an Apostle, yea, a principal one! A <HI>Peter,</HI> who had lately made an Eminent Confession of the Blessed <HI>Jesus,</HI> as being, <HI>The Christ, the Son of the Living God!</HI> A <HI>Peter,</HI> who had seen the Caelestial <HI>Transfigu∣ration</HI> of the Blessed <HI>Jesus</HI> in the Mount, and heard a voice from the <HI>Excellent Glory</HI> proclaim∣ing Him, <HI>The Beloved Son of God!</HI> A <HI>Peter,</HI> who had been a famous Preacher of the Blessed <HI>Jesus,</HI> and from Him Received a power to work <HI>Miracles</HI> in His Name! For such a <HI>Pe∣ter to Deny</HI> His Lord! O most amazing! And for him to Deny <HI>such</HI> a Lord! still worse; to <HI>Deny</HI> the Lord, of whom he had a little before, upon thorough Conviction said, <HI>Lord, Thou hast the words of Eternal Life; we believe, and are sure, that thou art that Christ, the Son of the Living God!</HI> To <HI>Deny</HI> the Lord, that was now undergoing all sorts of Sufferings and Miseries for him; yea, to <HI>Deny</HI> Him, with a complica∣tion of <HI>Impiety?</HI> To cast off all Dependence upon God, and upon His Providence and Faithfulness, and look on all our Lords Prae∣dictions, as Impostures! To be run down by a sorry, silly, little <HI>Door Keeper,</HI> and be more afraid of a little <HI>Maid,</HI> than of the God, who <HI>Made</HI> the World, and of the Lord, who shall <HI>Judge</HI> the World!

positive <HI>Promise</HI> of <HI>Dying</HI> for Him, and in a few Hours to break this <HI>promise,</HI> and not so much as venture on <HI>Speaking</HI> for Him!

<P>Upon the Fall of <HI>Peter,</HI> the general Refle∣ction to be made, is That which the Ancients made upon the Fall of <HI>David; Non Cadendi, sed Resurgendi Exemplum, in illo nobis est propo∣situm: audiant qui non ceciderunt, ne cadant; audiant qui ceciderunt, ut surg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt: non sint delect atio minorum, Lapsus majorum; sed sit Tremor minorum Lapsus majorum.</HI> Let the <HI>Fall</HI> of such a man, teach them that are not <HI>Fallen,</HI> how to prevent <HI>Falling</HI> and them that are <HI>Fallen,</HI> how to Rise out of their <HI>Falls.</HI> The <HI>Fall</HI> of so great a man, is a matter, not of

<HI>Pleasure,</HI> but of <HI>Terror,</HI> to them that are <HI>Less</HI> than he.</P>
<P>But let us descend unto a few more <HI>particu∣lar Admonitions.</HI></P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="reflection">
<HEAD>Reflection I.</HEAD>
<P>A very grievous <HI>Apostasy,</HI> tho' not a <HI>Total</HI> Apostasy, not a <HI>Final</HI> Apostasy, may befal a man of <HI>Real Christianity.</HI> The <HI>Christianity</HI> of <HI>Peter,</HI> was not utterly extinct, nor utterly did his <HI>Faith fail,</HI> when he fell into the Action of <HI>Denying the Lord that bought him.</HI> It was by the <HI>Fire-side,</HI> that <HI>Peter</HI> was guil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of this Act∣ion; and by the <HI>Fire side</HI> sometimes we may see an Emblem of his Condition in it. You may think, there is no <HI>Fire</HI> left, when yet you'l find raked up in the <HI>Embers, a Coal,</HI> that will be afterwards improved into a migh∣ty <HI>Flame.</HI> The Faith of <HI>Peter</HI> was a <HI>Coal</HI> co∣vered in the <HI>Embers;</HI> he still had a principle of <HI>Christianity</HI> in him, which was ready, when the present <HI>Sifting</HI> was over, to have asserted, as once he did, his <HI>Jesus,</HI> to be, <HI>The Christ, the Son of the Living God.</HI> Nevertheless, it was a terrible <HI>Swoon</HI> of <HI>Apostasy,</HI> which this famous Christian was fallen into. The <HI>Perseverance of the Faithful,</HI> is an Illustrious and Important Article of, <HI>The Faith once deliverd unto the Saints.</HI> To Deny the <HI>Perseverance of the Faithful,</HI> or, to affirm, That every <HI>Believer</HI> shall not cer∣tainly <HI>persevere in the Faith,</HI> is a very dange∣rous <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>resy,</HI> of men that are <HI>not found in the
<PB N="27" REF="001067_0027_0FAEF24A4A857370"/>
Faith.</HI> It must be granted, That <HI>Hypocrites</HI> may prove <HI>Apostates.</HI> There is a <HI>Show of Grace,</HI> that may be <HI>Lost;</HI> a <HI>Seeming</HI> that may be <HI>taken away.</HI> A <HI>Temporary Faith</HI> will prove no more than <HI>Temporary.</HI> [See Heb.6.4] Yea, it must be granted, That if the <HI>Saints</HI> were <HI>Left unto themselves,</HI> they would fall a∣way <HI>Totally</HI> and <HI>Finally. Angels</HI> themselves did so. The <HI>Dragon</HI> would sweep down <HI>Stars from Heaven,</HI> if they were not <HI>kept there, by the mighty power of God.</HI> But for all this, <HI>The Perseverance of the Saints,</HI> is infallibly secured. The Great <HI>God of Truth,</HI> has both <HI>Declared,</HI> and <HI>Promised,</HI> the <HI>Perseverance of the Faithful</HI> in their <HI>Faith.</HI> It is <HI>declared,</HI> in 1 Joh.3.9. <HI>Wha∣tsoever is Born of God, his seed remaineth in him.</HI> It is <HI>promised,</HI> in Joh.10.28. <HI>My Sheep shall never perish, neither shall any pluck them out of my Hand.</HI> Again, The <HI>Eternal Election</HI> of God, assures the <HI>Eternal Perseverance</HI> of the Faithful. All the Faithful are <HI>Ordained unto Eternal Life,</HI> [Act.13.48.] Now if any that are <HI>Ordained unto Eternal Life,</HI> should fall short of it, or lose their <HI>Faith,</HI> it would be a Disappointment unto the <HI>Decree</HI> of God; The <HI>Decree</HI> of God would be Defeated; yea, the very <HI>Knowledge</HI> of God, would be Deceived. This were impossible: 'Twere <HI>Blasphemy</HI> to imagine it. [See 2 Tim.2.19] Once more; The Faithful are <HI>purchased</HI> by the Lord Jesus Christ, and <HI>United</HI> to Him. Should they not <HI>persevere,</HI> the <HI>Death</HI> of the

<P>Nevertheless, 'Tis very sadly true, That Believers may in <HI>some degree,</HI> and a <HI>sad</HI> one, become <HI>Apostates. Grace</HI> may decline and wither grievously, in a true Child of God. Some that have a <HI>Saving Faith</HI> in their Hearts may yet grievously fall away from some anci∣ent and vigorous efforts of that <HI>Faith.</HI></P>

<P>First, It is plain, That <HI>Peter</HI> had been too <HI>Confident,</HI> and <HI>Arrogant.</HI> What <HI>Confidence</HI> was it in him, to say, Luk.22.23. <HI>Lord, I am rea∣dy to go with thee, both into Prison, and unto Death!</HI> What <HI>Arrogance,</HI> to say, Matth.26 33. <HI>Tho' all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended!</HI> The Ancients De∣scant with much Ingenuity, on <HI>Peters pride, as</HI> the cause of <HI>Peters fall.</HI> And at last <HI>Bernard</HI> concludes with this Instruction, <HI>Sibi ipsi fiders, non Fidei sed perfidiae est, nec-confidentiae sed Diffidentiae magis in seipso habere Fiduciam.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is also plain, That our Lord Jesus Christ had given this Admonition unto <HI>Peter;</HI> Mat.26 41. <HI>Watch and pray, that ye en∣ter not into Temptation.</HI> But <HI>Peter</HI> shamefully neglected the Duty of <HI>Praying</HI> with <HI>Watching,</HI> whereto he had been Admonished. This Negligence exposed him: and it will expose all that are guilty of it: He that keeps not much on his <HI>Knees,</HI> is not far from a <HI>Fall.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is likewise plain, That <HI>Peter,</HI> tho' he had promised, <HI>I will never be offended,</HI> was now <HI>offended,</HI> at the Disasters befalling our Lord Jesus Christ. When <HI>Peter</HI> saw the Enemies of our Lord <HI>falling backward,</HI> at His Voice, Now, who so mettlesome as <HI>he!</HI> But when <HI>Peter</HI> saw our Lord fall into the hands of His Enemies, and Led away by

them to all sorts of Miseries, <HI>Then</HI> he has no more to say, but, <HI>I know Him not!</HI> It is a grie∣vous thing to take up any <HI>prejudices</HI> against the Lord Jesus Christ, and His Truths, and Wayes, from the <HI>Afflictions</HI> that we see atten∣ding of them. Our Lord therefore said, Mat.26.31. <HI>All ye will be offended because of me.</HI></P>

<P>To chuse <HI>Evil Company,</HI> is a Folly, that will be <HI>Accompanied</HI> with a world of <HI>Evil.</HI> What was it that betray'd <HI>Peter?</HI> It was his falling into <HI>Evil Company.</HI> He who does <HI>That,</HI> knows not into what he shall <HI>Fall.</HI> We read, Luk.22.55. <HI>When they had kindled a Fire, and were sat down together,</HI> Peter <HI>sat down among them,</HI> And by <HI>Sitting down among</HI> those, who Blas∣phemed and Reviled the Lord Jesus Christ, where he durst not Reprove them, he came at length to do like the rest of the <HI>Company.</HI> It was a Note long ago made upon this mat∣ter; <HI>Vide quam noxia sint prav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rum Colloquia, quae cogunt Petrum, ut neget Christum, quem inter Discipulos Confessus erat Dei Filium.</HI> Alas, The Devil has not a stronger <HI>Enchantment</HI> for the Children of men, than <HI>Evil Company.</HI> Syrs, If you would be preserved from De∣nying of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, and from Destroying your own SOULS, be very cautious of your <HI>Company;</HI> under the

Fall of <HI>Peter,</HI> as one of the Terriblest Things, that ever we heard. But what a wonderful Thing is This!

We read, Mat.26.75. <HI>He wept bitterly:</HI> The Ancients add, until his <HI>Tears</HI> had worn Furrowes in his <HI>Cheeks.</HI> Oh! the astonishment, and indignation of Soul, wherewith he now cried out of himself, <HI>What have I done!

with Disposition, to Repeat his Affection to Him, [yea, and this by the <HI>Fire side</HI> also! See Joh.21.9] as often as his <HI>Denial</HI> of Him had been Repeated. Yea, This very <HI>Peter</HI> was afterwards made a worker of glorious <HI>Miracles;</HI> He who might admire that the Lord had not struck him Dead, for sinning so atrociously against Him, was used by the Lord for to <HI>Strike</HI> other Sinners <HI>Dead;</HI> yea, and for to <HI>Raise</HI> others from the <HI>Dead.</HI> And he who had by <HI>Sin given Scandal</HI> both to <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> was used, first as a most successful Preacher of the Gospel to the <HI>Jews,</HI> and afterwards, he was the first that Preached the <HI>Gospel of Salvation from Sin,</HI> unto the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> Yea, that very <HI>Peter,</HI> who with his <HI>Tongue,</HI> had horribly denyed the Lord Jesus Christ, and obeyed the <HI>Evil Spirit,</HI> by the <HI>Fire side.</HI> (and that he might be quietly by the <HI>Fire!</HI>) had the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> by the Lord Jesus Christ, within a little while bestowed upon him, with a Symbol of a <HI>Fie∣ry Tongue,</HI> enabling him to speak in many an <HI>Unknown Tongue,</HI> the <HI>Magnalia Dei,</HI> before thousands of Witnesses!

<HEAD>Our Second Observation.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Sometimes the Cold of the Weather, and the Winter, proves to men an Occasion, of their Denying the Lord, who made the Cold, and all our Succours against the Cold.</HEAD>
<P><PB N="36" REF="001067_0036_0FAEF566CA5877D0"/>
<HI>Quid prosuit Petro Exterius manus pidesq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ad Ignem Calefeciffe, animo interim interius obri∣guisse!</HI> Says one upon it. What <HI>Good</HI> got <HI>Pe∣ter</HI> by the <HI>Fire,</HI> when he did so much <HI>Ill</HI> at the <HI>Fire!</HI> and what signified his <HI>warming</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his <HI>Hands</HI> and his <HI>Feet,</HI> while the zeal of his <HI>Heart</HI> for his Lord, had such a <HI>Cold</HI> upon it. Alas, The <HI>Cold</HI> of the <HI>Weather,</HI> and the Win∣ter, often betrays us into a <HI>Moral Cold,</HI> which is infinitely worse than the <HI>Natural;</HI> and our want of being at the <HI>Fire,</HI> puts out the <HI>Fire</HI> of Religion in us. The Psalmist could say, Psal.147.18. <HI>Who can stand before Gods Cold!</HI> E∣ven the <HI>Constancy</HI> of our Souls, in the Service of God, is often impaired and impeded by <HI>His Cold;</HI> tho' methinks, its being <HI>His Cold,</HI> should rather <HI>pinch</HI> us to the doing of our Du∣ty in some respects, than <HI>chill;</HI> us from it.</P>
<P>We will briefly, and as the <HI>Cold</HI> now upon us, will allow us, Enquire,</P>
<P>First, <HI>How do men sometimes Deny the Lord on the Occasion of the Cold?</HI></P>
<P>Know it, Syrs, That when <HI>Duty</HI> to the Lord, is omitted, by reason of the <HI>Cold,</HI> then the Lord is <HI>Denyed</HI> for the <HI>Cold.</HI> The Neg∣lect of Christian Duties, is called, <HI>A Denial of the only Lord God, even of our Lord Jesus Christ.</HI> We read of some, who, <HI>In works Deny Him.</HI> When the <HI>Cold</HI> puts us by the Doing of such <HI>Good Works,</HI> as might be done by us notwith∣standing
<PB N="37" REF="001067_0037_0FAEF567B811BE98"/>
the <HI>Cold,</HI> we practically, <HI>Deny</HI> the Lord, <HI>because it is Cold.</HI> We <HI>Deny</HI> that our Lord Jesus Christ is our <HI>Saviour,</HI> we <HI>Deny</HI> that He is our <HI>Sovereign,</HI> we <HI>Deny,</HI> that He is our <HI>Example,</HI> when we <HI>Deny</HI> to keep the <HI>Precepts</HI> which He has <HI>commanded us to keep with Dili∣gence.</HI> Impiety is called, 1 Tim.5.8. <HI>A De∣nying of the Faith.</HI> If we are Impious, we are <HI>Denyers</HI> of the Lord.</P>
<P>Now the <HI>Cold</HI> is often made an unjust, and an undue <HI>pretence</HI> for mens omitting of their <HI>Duty.</HI> Many a man is that <HI>Sluggard,</HI> who, (Prov.20.4) <HI>will not plough</HI> (nor do many another Duty) <HI>by reason of the Cold.</HI> Some∣times, <HI>by reason of the cold,</HI> we omit the Duties of <HI>Piety.</HI> Our <HI>Supplications</HI> are <HI>Frozen,</HI> when the <HI>Frost</HI> has taken every thing else: Our <HI>Meditations</HI> are <HI>sapless,</HI> when the <HI>Sap</HI> is gone from all the Fields about us; we needlesly ab∣sent our selves from the <HI>House of God,</HI> when we can be warmer in our <HI>own Houses;</HI> and object the Snow, or the Wet, as a <HI>Lion, in the way:</HI> We lay aside <HI>Working about our own Sal∣vation,</HI> when our Hands are <HI>Sealed up</HI> from doing our <HI>other work:</HI> We lay aside the <HI>Wars of the Lord,</HI> or our combate with our interior Adversaries, when Retired into our <HI>Winter Quarters. Piety</HI> cools, with every thing else.</P>
<P>Again, Sometimes <HI>by reason of the cold,</HI> we omit the Duties of <HI>Charity,</HI> Our <HI>Charity</HI> is often as <HI>cold,</HI> as the <HI>Time,</HI> and <HI>because of the
<PB N="38" REF="001067_0038_0FAEF56A529C30D0"/>
Time.</HI> When we are <HI>Eating</HI> and <HI>Drinking</HI> at our <HI>Winter Tables,</HI> we are not grieved for those that want <HI>Meat</HI> or <HI>Drink:</HI> Nor are we <HI>grieved for the poor,</HI> who have <HI>no Covering,</HI> while we are <HI>well Covered,</HI> and are Shivering over a <HI>Brands End</HI> or two, (the <HI>Widows Fire,</HI>) while we are more than sufficiently <HI>Warmed,</HI> Our own circumstances, that should rather <HI>Excite</HI> us, to do all the Good we can, <HI>unto</HI> those that are not so well circumstanced, <HI>con∣geal</HI> us rather into an Insensibility of other peoples; and the <HI>Love of many waxes cold.</HI></P>
<P>Once more; Don't we often <HI>mispend</HI> our Hours, <HI>by reason of the cold?</HI> Is not advantage taken, when our <HI>Clocks</HI> won't <HI>go,</HI> for such a mispence of <HI>Time,</HI> as if we dream the <HI>Time</HI> also Stood <HI>still!</HI> What <HI>Gaming,</HI> what <HI>Supersti∣tion,</HI> what <HI>Profanity,</HI> and (which is to say <HI>All</HI> the <HI>rest,</HI> and <HI>All</HI> the <HI>worst!</HI>) What <HI>Evil Com∣pany,</HI> is the <HI>Winter</HI> often made an occasion for? Truly, Our Lord Jesus Christ, is in some degree <HI>Denied,</HI> by a such miscarriages.</P>
<P>We will then Enquire,</P>
<P>Secondly. <HI>How men may come rather to con∣fess, than to deny the Lord, on the occasion of the Cold?</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Croud</HI> will do best in the <HI>Cold,</HI> I will <HI>croud</HI> close together a few Instructions.</P>
<P>First, Consider, O Christians, That the more <HI>Self denial</HI> you undergo, for the <HI>Serving</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, under the Obstructi∣ons
<PB N="39" REF="001067_0039_0FAEF56B3880BCA8"/>
of the <HI>Cold,</HI> the greater will be the <HI>Re∣compence</HI> which the Lord Jesus Christ will be∣stow upon you, at the <HI>Spring</HI> of Heavenly and Eternal Glory, The more that our Devoti∣ons do cost us, the greater is the <HI>comfort</HI> and <HI>sweetness</HI> of them, even in this world▪ and the greater the <HI>Reward</HI> that is to come, in the World to come. The <HI>Martyrs,</HI> that were <HI>Frozen to Death,</HI> went unto the pleasant Cli∣mate of Paradise. Even those <HI>Bodies,</HI> that have suffered the Hardships of <HI>Cold,</HI> in the Service of the Lord, shall one day be made <HI>Chariots of Fire,</HI> for the <HI>Spirits</HI> of the Faithful. Syrs, I say unto you, 1 Cor.15.58. <HI>Your la∣bour shall not be in vain in the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Consider also, That there is a worse <HI>cold,</HI> than that of the <HI>Winter,</HI> against which we are to be fortified and cautioned. There is the <HI>Cold</HI> of our <HI>Formality,</HI> against which our wish must be, <HI>Oh! That I may be servant in Spirit, serving the Lord!</HI> And, there is the <HI>Cold</HI> of our <HI>Unregeneracy,</HI> against which, our wish must be, <HI>Oh! That this dark time of my Inacti∣vity for serving the Lord, were over with me!</HI> But, Let us nextly, Beware of perverting and abusing the <HI>Dispensation</HI> which God gives us, because of the <HI>Cold.</HI> Because our Lord hath said, Mar.9.13. <HI>I will have mercy and not sa∣crifice;</HI> Let us not upon the Excuse of show∣ing <HI>mercy</HI> to our selves, defraud the Lord of that <HI>Sacrifice,</HI> which we may be able to bring
<PB N="40" REF="001067_0040_0FAEF56B499F6CB8"/>
unto Him. Deal fairly with Heaven; And let us not be so <HI>unmerciful</HI> unto our selves, [for in the issue, we prove so!] as to with∣hold from the Lord, what we may, without any bearing against the <HI>Sixth Commandment,</HI> bear to do f or Him, left we <HI>Sacrifice</HI> our selves unto His terrible <HI>Justice,</HI> who will <HI>not be mocked!</HI></P>
<P>Finally; When we are <HI>Warming our selves by the Fire,</HI> like <HI>Peter,</HI> because of the <HI>Cold,</HI> Let us be <HI>warming our selves,</HI> with suitable <HI>Reflecti∣ons.</HI> The Psalmist could say, Psal.39.3. <HI>While I was musing, the Fire burned.</HI> Syrs, While we have the <HI>Fire burning</HI> on the Hearth before us, let us be <HI>musing,</HI> on such things, as may cause another <HI>Fire to Burn</HI> within us; even a <HI>Fire</HI> of <HI>Zeal</HI> for the Lord Jesus Christ, and the concerns of the Caelestial Kingdom. Even the <HI>Fire</HI> it self may be made a notable mat∣ter, for abundance of Holy, and Useful, and Ingenious <HI>Reflections.</HI> When we behold the <HI>Fire</HI> before us, there are very many points of <HI>Christianity,</HI> which we may fetch out of it. I call to mind, That there is a call given, Psal. 148 8. <HI>Praise the Lord, o fire.</HI> I now say, <HI>Praise the Lord, O Christian;</HI> and let the <HI>Fire</HI> cause thee to <HI>Praise the Lord,</HI> and make thee a <HI>better Christian.</HI> I have met with a Note in the Incomparable <HI>Alsted; That as the Lion fears nothing so much as the Fire, so the Devil fears nothing so much as our Godliness, which is
<PB N="41" REF="001067_0041_0FAEF56C224FEF80"/>
the true Fire of the Soul.</HI> Well, but now I may tell you, That the <HI>Fire on the Hearth,</HI> may be made very subservient unto that <HI>Fire of the Soul,</HI> and help to keep alive our <HI>Godliness.</HI> The <HI>Spirit</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ, carries us along thro' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Godliness,</HI> by being a <HI>Spirit of Burning within us.</HI> Oh! Beware of <HI>Quenching that Spirit,</HI> by Disobedience or Sensuality, more than you would beware of leaving your selves utterly without <HI>Fire,</HI> in the sharpest <HI>Winter.</HI> But be sensible, That very particular∣ly, by the <HI>Good Thoughts</HI> extracted out of the <HI>Fire</HI> it self, the <HI>Spirit</HI> of the Lord, may do ve∣ry much of the Office, of a <HI>Spirit of Burning</HI> upon us.</P>

<P>We have not so <HI>learned Christ,</HI> as to have our <HI>Idolatrous, Fire places.</HI> But we shall <HI>Serve Christ</HI> if our <HI>Ordinary Fire places</HI> become Serviceable to us, on <HI>Religious</HI> Accounts, as well as <HI>Natural</HI> Ones.

<P>This Meditation carries me to consider, <HI>How do I know the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament to be the Word of God!</HI> And that which makes the consideration more agreea∣ble, is, That this <HI>Word,</HI> is called, Jer.20 9. <HI>A Burning Fire.</HI> It is a Thing of more than or∣dinary consequence unto every Christian, to be well established in this point, <HI>How may a Christian indeed know, That our Bible is the Word of God, or, a Book of Truth, and a Rule of Life, given by Inspiration from Heaven?</HI> For, the in∣fluence of the <HI>Bible,</HI> on our whole <HI>Behaviour</HI> here, and <HI>Blessedness</HI> hereafter, depends on our <HI>Faith</HI> of this point; &amp; our grand Enemy labours nothing more, than to keep our <HI>Faith</HI> hereof as Feeble as ever he can To confirm our <HI>Faith</HI> of our <HI>Bibles</HI> being the <HI>Word of God,</HI> we are, not unfurnished with moral <HI>Arguments</HI> enough to silence <HI>the contradiction of Sinners.</HI> It is in∣finitely reasonable to Believe, That the most High God has committed unto Writing, some where or other, what He would have us <HI>Think,</HI> and to <HI>Do,</HI> in order to our <HI>Glorifying</HI> of Him.
<PB N="45" REF="001067_0045_0FAEF570E0257248"/>
Now, if our <HI>Bible,</HI> be not the <HI>Writing,</HI> where in the Will of God is to be found, it is no where to be found at all; for there is none that can stand in competition with i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there is no where else to be met withal, any <HI>Scheme</HI> of the way for our coming to the Enjoyment of God, that can give any tolerable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is acti∣on to a Reasonable mind And who else but God, could be the Author of it? <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> men,</HI> and <HI>Ill Angels,</HI> would never have conceived a <HI>Sy∣stem</HI> of such an Holy and Heavenly Tenour, and so opposite, yea so Torturous, unto their own vicious Inclinations. <HI>Good men,</HI> and <HI>Good Angels</HI> would not have <HI>Lyed</HI> for God, and have imposed their own Inventions upon their Maker. And indeed, the Remarkable Pro∣vidence of God, in preserving our <HI>Bible,</HI> so uncorrupt for so many Ages, notwithstand∣ing the horrible plots of Earth and Hell, to have utterly extinguished it, (which can't be said of any other Composure) This proclaims, That it is dear to <HI>God,</HI> yea, that <HI>God</HI> Himself espouses it, as being the Author of it. The <HI>Bible</HI> testifies very many other Things, and at the same time testifies to its own <HI>Divine Ori∣ginal:</HI> Tis found infallibly True in all its o∣ther Testimonies; it is a <HI>Tried Word,</HI> and it never fails: Why should it not then be own'd as True in this one Article also, when it as∣serts its own Divinity? But after all, the main proof which a Christian has, for his <HI>Bibles</HI> be∣ing
<PB N="46" REF="001067_0046_0FAEF571D916ED88"/>
the <HI>Word of God,</HI> is of that sort, that assures him, The <HI>Fire</HI> is indeed the <HI>Fire;</HI> even a <HI>Self∣evidencing, and scarce utterable Demonstration.</HI> The Sacred Writings, carry with them, and in them, a Demonstration of their <HI>Divine O∣riginal</HI> and <HI>Authority,</HI> unto the Souls of the <HI>Faithful,</HI> wherein it appears to them, with no less clearness than the <HI>Light</HI> and the <HI>Heat</HI> of the <HI>Fire</HI> before them The Holy Spirit of God, working on the Hearts of the Faithful, causes them to <HI>see</HI> (or, I should rather say, to <HI>feel,</HI>) such a <HI>Majesty</HI> in the <HI>Bible,</HI> such a glorious Constellation of Noble and Charm∣ing <HI>Mysteries,</HI> and such a Directing, such a Sanctifying, such a Strengthening and Com∣forting <HI>Efficacy,</HI> that they are certain, it could proceed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> none but the Holy Spirit of God. Their Hearts are accordingly, so struck, and warm'd, and mov'd, and chang'd by the Holy Spirit of God, breathing in and from the <HI>Bible,</HI> upon them, that tho' perhaps they can't always put their <HI>Arguments</HI> for it into <HI>Form,</HI> yet they are sure, <HI>(Fire is Fire)</HI> it can be no other than the <HI>Word of God;</HI> and what∣ever <HI>Arguments</HI> may be produced unto the contrary, they will keep to their conclusion, and <HI>rather Dy, than give up the Cause.</HI></P>
<P>But as the <HI>Fire</HI> passes from one <HI>Billet</HI> unto another, so let my <HI>Thoughts</HI> here, in passing along, at least glance upon one Subject more.</P>
<P>There are certain Enjoyments with which
<PB N="47" REF="001067_0047_0FAEF572D21E1790"/>
the Spirit of God favours the Souls of His Faithful People; and especially the perswasi∣ons of a <HI>particular Faith,</HI> which they some∣times Enjoy, in their <HI>Prayers,</HI> for this or that particular <HI>Smile</HI> of God on their Affayrs. This <HI>particular Faith,</HI> is not so much the <HI>Duty,</HI> as the <HI>Dignity,</HI> and <HI>Priviledge,</HI> of the Faithful, and not granted unto <HI>all,</HI> but here and there, according to the Sovereign pleasure of Hea∣ven, gloriously irradiating their minds, and with a certain powerful, Heart mel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing, Hea∣venly <HI>Afflatus,</HI> assuring of them, <HI>That God hath granted the Thing, which they have asked of Him.</HI> Well, tho' this <HI>particular Faith,</HI> has a counter∣feit, wherein many have been deceived; yet such a Thing there is, that is a special <HI>Opera∣tion of the Spirit of God,</HI> and perhaps of His Holy Angels, on the minds of His Holy <HI>Chil∣dren.</HI> The Question is, <HI>How do I know this Operation from a counterfeit?</HI> My Answer is, That no words of mine can answer the Que∣stion; I <HI>know</HI> it, as I know the <HI>Fire</HI> to be the <HI>Fire;</HI> I <HI>feel</HI> it, but no words of mine can ex∣press, how it <HI>feels.</HI></P>

<P>In the <HI>Accommodation,</HI> which my <HI>Fire</HI> gives to very many of my circumstances, I enjoy great <HI>Blessings</HI> of God. Tho' my <HI>Fire</HI> has

not immediately come down from Heaven, to me, like that upon the <HI>Israelitish Altars:</HI> Yet I can, by ascending but a very few Steps of contemplation, see the God of Heaven bestow∣ing my <HI>Fire</HI> upon me. Those <HI>Igneous particles,</HI> which when more loosely Diffused, make <HI>Heat,</HI> and when more closely collected and compacted, make <HI>Flame,</HI> are a creature of <HI>God,</HI> and no inconsiderable part of <HI>His</HI> Creation. The <HI>Fuel,</HI> which gathers these <HI>Igneous particles</HI> together, and puts them, and feeds them, in their <HI>motion,</HI> for my present Comfort, is be∣stow'd upon me, by the Kindness of <HI>God:</HI> nor should I be able to subsist, if <HI>He</HI> had not been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Kind unto me.</P>
<P>I could but pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty the poor <HI>Indians</HI> in the <HI>Marian</HI> Islands, when I found <HI>Le Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ten</HI> in his late History of those Islands, reporting, That before the Arrival of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> there, they had never seen any <HI>Fire;</HI> and the First <HI>Fire</HI> that <HI>Magellan</HI> kindled, they look'd on, as a terrible Animal, which devoured the wood, and kept at an huge Distance from it for fear it should Hurt them.

<P>And now, I cannot but observe; <HI>There is utterly a Fault among us.</HI> This is, That the more Common, and Customary, Obvious and Ordinary <HI>Mercies</HI> of our Lives, are least of all Acknowledged. If a Religious Man. were Admitted unto a <HI>Fire,</HI> but once or Twice in a year, how thankfully would he take Notice of it, and say, <HI>O my good God, I thank thee, for this Relief<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>!</HI> But because we come to the <HI>Fire</HI> every Day, and every Hour of the Day, our <HI>good God,</HI> has few or no particular <HI>Thanks</HI> for His <HI>Goodness</HI> in it. O Stupid Ingratitude! Why should a Succour in certain peculiar &amp; unusual <HI>Exigencies,</HI> produce our <HI>Thanksgiving</HI> to God; and yet God be Honoured with no <HI>Thanks∣giving</HI> for those Enjoyments, wherein we are continually Succoured against all the Danger of those <HI>Exigencies!</HI> Oh, That my <HI>Fire</HI> might now Warm this dull Heart of mine, to Resolve upon more Explicit <HI>Praises</HI> of God, as well for my <HI>Fire,</HI> as for those other Mercies which have nothing in them to <HI>Lessen</HI> them, except what indeed should rather <HI>Heighten</HI> them unto me; namely, Their being <HI>Daily Mercies.</HI></P>
<P>The Salvages of these Regions, have thought, the <HI>Fire,</HI> must needs be a <HI>God,</HI> because

when a poor man is ready to perish with <HI>Cold</HI> in the <HI>Winter,</HI> one <HI>Spark</HI> of it, will in a few Minutes blaze out so Serviceably, as to Save his Life.

<P>WHile I am thus Writing on the <HI>Benefits</HI> of the <HI>Fire</HI> in General, Methinks, I am called upon thereby, not only to be <HI>Thankful</HI> for the <HI>Fire,</HI> but also to be <HI>Useful</HI> like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.

<P>It was justly ask'd, <HI>Can a man be profitable unto God?</HI> No, That he cannot; And when he has done all that he can do, (were it a Million times more than it is,) he must own, <HI>Lord, I am an unprofitable Servant.</HI> The most glorious <HI>Use,</HI> that I can be put unto, is, To be made a Subject of those <HI>Graces,</HI> and a Doer of those Gracious <HI>Actions,</HI> which the ever blessed God, who makes me so, shall Behold with Delight, and which may Excite all other Be∣holders to magnify Him for ever.</P>

<HEAD>On the Light cast by the Fire upon the Ob∣jects about it.</HEAD>

<PB N="54" REF="001067_0054_0FAEF5798A6DD878"/>
thereof, they have a particular <HI>Brightness,</HI> and Beauty upon them.</P>
<P>When I see the <HI>Reflection</HI> of the <HI>Light,</HI> on the Objects about the <HI>Fire,</HI> methinks, I am furnished with <HI>Light</HI> enough, to make a <HI>Re∣flection</HI> of my own upon it. This <HI>Light</HI> leads me unto that <HI>Glory,</HI> that shall be Enjoy'd by the Saints in the Heavenly World; and unto the very <HI>Fountain</HI> of all their <HI>Glory.</HI> If unto the <HI>Fire,</HI> I should Resemble the Glorious Lord JESUS CHRIST, who shall one day appear in <HI>Flaming Fire,</HI> the Resemblance, might with many Good Thoughts be prosecuted. It is enough, that our Lord, the <HI>Sun of Righteous∣ness,</HI> is compared unto the <HI>Sun,</HI> which is an <HI>Ocean of Fire;</HI> and that Caelestial and Wonder∣ful <HI>Fire ball,</HI> corresponding with the little Fla∣shes on my Hearth, in the property of <HI>Lumi∣nositie,</HI> the comparison that is now to be made, will be sufficiently vindicated. Nor will it be unserviceable unto this purpose, to remark, that in some Languages (particularly the <HI>Syriac</HI> and <HI>Chaldee</HI>) the same word that is used for <HI>Fire,</HI> is used also for <HI>Light.</HI> The Splendor of my <HI>Fire,</HI> tho' so sparkling and so dazzling, that the most lively Limner can't paint it out unto the Life, is but a <HI>black Sha∣dow,</HI> of the <HI>Glory</HI> which the Disciples in the <HI>Holy Mountain,</HI> saw resting on the Transfigur∣ed <HI>Lord of Glory.</HI> One of them that saw it, has reported unto us.

<HEAD>On the Mending of the Fire.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Fire</HI> in a little while I see falls into circumstances, that call upon the Com∣pany, <HI>Will some body please to mend the Fire?</HI> The <HI>Materials</HI> that supply the <HI>Fire</HI> with <HI>Fuel,</HI> are in a little while so wasted, that the <HI>Re∣mainders</HI> of those Materials fall into <HI>Dis∣order;</HI> if the <HI>Fire</HI> be not <HI>mended,</HI> it will soon be <HI>ended;</HI> and if thing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be not quick∣ly restored, and repaired into a <HI>better Or∣der</HI> about the <HI>Fire,</HI> it will not be long, be∣fore none will be the better for it.</P>
<P>But when I see some body going to <HI>Mend the Fire,</HI> I think we that Sit by it, want <HI>mending</HI> much more than the <HI>Fire</HI> it self. That Call, <HI>Mend the Fire,</HI> is not of a millionth part
<PB N="61" REF="001067_0061_0FAEF57EC73EB898"/>
of so much importance, as that call, Jer. 7 3, 5. <HI>Amend your Wayes and your Doings;</HI> and a∣gain, <HI>Throughly Amend your Wayes and your Do∣ings.</HI> I am sensible, <HI>[My God, make me more Sensible!]</HI> That there is very much <HI>Amiss</HI> in my <HI>Heart,</HI> and in my <HI>Life,</HI> much that wants to be <HI>mended.</HI> I have heard a great and a just cry made, for, <HI>A Reformation</HI> The me∣thod of obtaining a general <HI>Reformation,</HI> would be for every one, to <HI>mend one.</HI> A whole Ar∣my is presently <HI>Turn'd</HI> about, when every man in the Army <HI>Turns</HI> himself.</P>
<P>Wherefore, <HI>What shall I do?</HI> The first thing to be done, in answer to that Question, is for every man to put another Question; even that, <HI>What have I done?</HI> It would be an agree∣able thing, for a man to take a well express'd Catalogue of Things <HI>Required</HI> &amp; of Things <HI>Forbidden,</HI> in the Ten Commandments of God. Beholding himself in that <HI>Glass,</HI> a man may come to see his own criminal <HI>Omissions,</HI> and <HI>Commissions,</HI> and know what there is to be <HI>mended</HI> in him. When a man has gone thus far towards the <HI>mending</HI> of himself, let not his <HI>next work</HI> be, according to the <HI>preposterous Di∣vinity</HI> of our Dayes, to make <HI>Vows,</HI> That he will do no more <HI>Amiss.</HI> Those ill timed <HI>Vows</HI> will be broken on the next <HI>Opportunity,</HI> or <HI>Temptation</HI> to break them.

And until God be <HI>Reconciled</HI> unto a man, thro' the <HI>Atonement</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ applied unto him, he will remain a <HI>Slave</HI> to the Lusts, into the dreadful Hands whereof, he is put over by the spotless Justice of Heaven. While a Sinner is in this <HI>unpardon'd,</HI> and unhappy State, all hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Resolutions</HI> to <HI>Amend</HI> what is <HI>Amiss</HI> with him, will signify no more, than the <HI>Green Wythes,</HI> which once bound the Champion: without passing from the <HI>Fire,</HI> to come at a similitude for them, They will be <HI>as a Threed of Tow is broken, when it toucheth the Fire.</HI> But having sought the <HI>Pardon</HI> of what we find <HI>A∣miss</HI> with us, Then 'tis time to proceed, and purpose, and resolve against our miscarriages, We must humbly ask of God, the Help of His Grace, to <HI>Amend</HI> what is <HI>Amiss</HI> with us, under this encouragement, That our Lord Je∣sus Christ has <HI>purchased</HI> this <HI>Grace</HI> for us, and His New Covenant has <HI>promised</HI> it. Encoura∣ged and Fortified with this consideration, a man may do well considerately to <HI>Draw up,</HI>
<PB N="63" REF="001067_0063_0FAEF582363EAC48"/>
the several Points of Amendment, that he would propound unto himself. Let a man distinctly <HI>Contrive,</HI> what points he will desire to <HI>Amend,</HI> in his <HI>Thoughts,</HI> in his <HI>Words,</HI> in his <HI>Calling,</HI> in his <HI>Family,</HI> in his <HI>Company,</HI> and in the several <HI>Relations</HI> that are stain'd by him: Let him think, <HI>How would I be, or do better in each of these points?</HI> and have <HI>Written Memo∣rials</HI> of them, to be afterwards Reflected up∣on.</P>
<P>There are many <HI>Seasons</HI> very proper to be taken, for this our Self=Amendment. It is especially seasonable, when a Christian has heard a good <HI>Sermon,</HI> then to Retire, and Ponder, <HI>What am I call'd upon to Amend, by the Sermon that I have heard?</HI> One being ask'd, <HI>What can you Remember of the last Sermon?</HI> Replied, I <HI>can't Remember so much as I would; but I do not Forget, that I was told of a Fault, which I hope, 'twill be my care to Amend</HI> Ex∣cellently well <HI>Remembred!</HI> And it would be a thing further seasonable, and very serviceable, for a Christian sometimes to set apart a <HI>whole Day</HI> for Devotions in <HI>secret places;</HI> and make it not only a Day of <HI>Humiliations</HI> for what is <HI>Amiss</HI> in us, but also a Day of <HI>Reformations.</HI> A Christian does never keep such a <HI>Day,</HI> but the <HI>Fire is mended</HI> with him; every thing lies abundantly more to Rights, and his <HI>Love,</HI> and <HI>Zeal</HI> is in a more <HI>flaming ardour.</HI> Neverthe∣less, As our <HI>Fire</HI> must be often <HI>mended;</HI> after
<PB N="64" REF="001067_0064_0FAEF58290DB8958"/>
the first <HI>mending</HI> of it, there will soon be oc∣casion to <HI>mend</HI> it over and over again; so a Christian will assuredly find, that when he has rectifyed himself into the best <HI>Self Amend∣ment</HI> that he can he will soon grow out of frame; it won<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be long before he must over and over again, be at pains to <HI>Reform</HI> what is <HI>Amiss.</HI></P>
<P>In fine, I can't see the <HI>Fire mended,</HI> without that wish, which is more <HI>Charitable</HI> than <HI>Cen∣sorious; Lord mend us all!</HI> But I must add, <HI>Lord, no man wants it more than my self!</HI></P>

as well as little <HI>Cottages;</HI> And the Multiplica∣tion of such Disasters and Destructions, in our Age, (especially by the Arms, of a cer∣tain, OG, or, <HI>Burner,</HI>) has been thought by some, to be somewhat praesagious of that <HI>Con∣flagration,</HI> which the Oracles of Heaven fore∣tel to our Sinful Earth. Whether such Deso∣lations by <HI>Fire,</HI> be any <HI>Proesage</HI> of this Grand one, I am sure, those little ones that are on my <HI>Hearth,</HI> will serve as a <HI>Figure</HI> of it, and lead a Devout mind unto the Contemplation of an Universal <HI>Conflagration.</HI></P>
<P>May the cry of <HI>Fire!</HI> now Awaken my Soul, unto some serious Thoughts on the <HI>Fla∣ming Fire,</HI> wherein our Lord is e're long to be <HI>Revealed from Heaven!</HI> There is, in the Creation of God, a Creature called, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire; which is a certain Fluid, consisting of parts extreamly small, and light and very su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ile, active and susceptive of motion. An <HI>Aggre∣gate</HI> of these parts, in such a Number, as to be <HI>visible</HI> unto the <HI>Eye,</HI> is what we call, <HI>Fire,</HI> and <HI>Flame;</HI> a lesser, thinner, and more dispersed <HI>Collection</HI> of them, is <HI>Heat,</HI> and <HI>Warmth. Fire</HI> and <HI>Heat,</HI> only differ in that circumstance. The <HI>Fire</HI> on the <HI>Hearth,</HI> is but an Assembly of these <HI>Igneous</HI> particles, which, as by a sor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <HI>magnetism,</HI> naturally come together, where they have once begun to assemble, and put on the Figure that we see, when they <HI>operate</HI> upon combustible matter, to <HI>separate</HI> the parts
<PB N="66" REF="001067_0066_0FAEF5841619BED0"/>
of it. Now, there is a nearly uniform, and perpetual <HI>Fire,</HI> disseminated thro' the Body of the <HI>Earth,</HI> and especially the <HI>interior parts</HI> of it; and unto this <HI>Fire</HI> are to be ascribed, not a few of those <HI>Phoenomena,</HI> which our <HI>Terra∣queous Globe</HI> hath within it, or upon it. A∣mong other things, done by this <HI>Fire,</HI> one is, that it bears up the <HI>Water</HI> of the <HI>Abyss,</HI> every where towards the Surface of the <HI>Globe,</HI> as near as possible in <HI>right Lines,</HI> unless where the Denser <HI>Strata</HI> thereof do more intercept the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and there it passes thro' but very slowly, and the rest gl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s along, till it find Apertures convenient for it. When this <HI>Fire,</HI> being diverted from is ordinary course, is Assembled in a greater quantity than is usual, it causes an unusual Intumescence in the <HI>Wa∣ter</HI> of the <HI>Abyss,</HI> which pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s it into very great Commotions: and making at the same time, the like Effort upon the <HI>Earth,</HI> which is ex∣panded upon the Face of the <HI>Abyss;</HI> it occasi∣ons that Agitation of it, that we call, <HI>An Earthquake;</HI> whereby the superincumbent <HI>Strata,</HI> are horribly shockt, and rent, and the very Foundations of them are undermined, and perhaps whole Cities, and Mountains, and Countreys do sink down to rights into the <HI>Abyss</HI> underneath, and the Rising Water, makes a <HI>Lake,</HI> where those Countreys were Formerly Inhabited.

<P>But that which I hasten to observe is, That there is a Terrible, and an Amazing Use, which the God of Heaven, will make of the <HI>Subterraneous Fire,</HI> to bring a <HI>Conflagration</HI> up∣on <HI>Earth,</HI> when the <HI>Time for the Restitution of all things,</HI> is arrived.

who have taken <HI>Innocent</HI> men, yea, very <HI>Ver∣tuous</HI> ones, and have <HI>Rosted</HI> them to Death in the <HI>Fire,</HI> with lingring and horrid Agonies, and Exercised a thousand other exquisite Cru∣elties upon them.

But which yet more evidently proclaims the <HI>punishment</HI> of the <HI>Damned</HI> in the <HI>Fire</HI> of <HI>Hell</HI> to be <HI>intole∣rable,</HI> is, the <HI>Nature,</HI> and <HI>Author,</HI> of the <HI>punish∣ment.</HI> Now the <HI>principal punishment</HI> in the <HI>Fire</HI> of <HI>Hell,</HI> is the <HI>Wrath</HI> of the Infinite GOD, immediately smiting of the <HI>Soul.</HI> The <HI>Conscience</HI> of a Sinner, which is a Fa∣culty by his Creator put into him, to be a special Instrument of Him that Created it, <HI>This</HI> being set on <HI>Fire,</HI> by immediate Impres∣sions, from the Wrath of God upon it, will fill the Sinner with terrible Dolour, and Hor∣ror, and Anguish throughout Eternal Ages.

<P>THere was once a Prince in the <HI>English</HI> Nation, concerning whom it was thought by some, that some <HI>words</HI> which he <HI>spoke,</HI> hastened upon him the Fate that made him <HI>Speechless.</HI> Among the memorable words of that Prince, I have read, that being invited unto a Merchants House, where he saw a great pair of <HI>Brass And Irons,</HI> he had this Reflection thereup∣on. <HI>These gaudy Appearances of shining Brass, are not the Pillars that h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld up the Fire; (as your Bishops and your Doctors are not:) but they are the little Creepers of Iron which bear up the Fire.

<HEAD>On the Lighting of a Candle at the Fire.</HEAD>
<P>GOing this Evening, to write a short Re∣flection upon my <HI>Fire,</HI> it was necessary my <HI>Candle</HI> should first be <HI>Lighted,</HI> and it being at the <HI>Fire</HI> it self that it was <HI>Lighted,</HI> this very circumstance affords me something to Reflect upon.</P>
<P>If I compare <HI>Contention</HI> unto the <HI>Fire,</HI> I shall have Scripture and Reason enough, to justify the comparison. And now, though I hope, I shall not be a <HI>man of Contention</HI> my self, yet I would fain fetch <HI>Light</HI> from the <HI>Contention</HI> wherein I see other men engaged. Let the <HI>Heat</HI> of <HI>Contentious</HI> people afford <HI>Light</HI> unto me, and let me Learn many <HI>Instructions of Wisdom,</HI> out of their <HI>Foolish Contentions.</HI></P>
<P>Whatever <HI>Contentions</HI> do happen, they may soon Teach me, <HI>What</HI> a strange Efficacy <HI>Sa∣tan</HI> has, upon Humane Spirits and Affayrs, when God shall permit a <HI>perverse Spirit</HI> for to be mingled in a Neighbourhood, or in a Na∣tion: And, <HI>How</HI> Selfish men are, how Ab∣surd, how Froward, how deaf unto Reason, and how little sense they have of their own Mortality, when once <HI>Passion</HI> has got the <HI>Up∣per hand</HI> of them in their little Quarrels, wherein they strive to get the <HI>Upper hand</HI> of

It was a Saving of R. <HI>Sole∣lomen, Cum Deus Judicium facit in Justis, ti∣metur et Laudatur; nam fi in illis hoe facit, quanto magis in Impiis?</HI> Let me with an Hum∣bling and Trembling Heart, confess before the Lord; <HI>Lord, Thy Fiery Rebukes are dispensed unto far more Holy and Useful men than I am; I adore thy Sovereignty, that such a Dry Stick as I, be not presently consumed in the Fire of thy Wrath: And I would walk in Fear before thee: my Flesh trembles for fear of thee, and I am a∣fraid of thy Judgments.</HI></P>
<P>When I see any thing of a <HI>Green Tree</HI> laid on the <HI>Fire,</HI> I would call to mind those words of the Apostle, 1 Pet. 4. 18 <HI>If the Righteous scarcely are saved, where shall the Ungodly and the Sinner appear?</HI> The sin∣ful Wretches that Sin has made so combu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tible.

<HEAD>On throwing a piece of Leather into the Fire.</HEAD>
<P>ONE casting into the <HI>Fire,</HI> a bit of <HI>Lea∣ther,</HI> its moving, its wriggling, its twist∣ing one way and another, carried some show of <HI>Sense</HI> with it: It seemed as if it had the same <HI>sense</HI> in it, which there would have been in the Creature to which it once belonged: One is ready to expect a <HI>Cry</HI> from it. A thing wholly <HI>Insensible,</HI> does in the <HI>Fire</HI> I see, put on a Semblance of mighty <HI>Sensibility.</HI></P>
<P>An <HI>Hypocrite</HI> is one without a principle of <HI>Life:</HI> He is one altogether destitute of that <HI>Life,</HI> wherein God is Known, and Serv'd, and Glorified. He has no <HI>Living Sense</HI> of Spiri∣tual and Eternal Objects. But when an <HI>Hy∣pocrite</HI> is cast into the <HI>Fire</HI> of some <HI>Affliction,</HI> he seems as if he had some <HI>Life</HI> in him: his <HI>Prayers,</HI> and his <HI>Vows,</HI> and his <HI>Devout Resoluti∣ons,</HI> and various <HI>Devotions,</HI> look very <HI>Sensibly,</HI> when some Grief or Fear is <HI>Afflicting</HI> of him. One would think, who but a <HI>Child of God,</HI> could be so serious, and so <HI>Sensible,</HI> as we see this <HI>Afflicted Hypocrite?</HI> Oh, There's no Re∣lying

on the <HI>Showes,</HI> that men make in their <HI>Affliction.</HI> I will mention but one Observati∣on to confirm it. I have often been concer∣ned with Criminals under the Sentence of <HI>Death,</HI> having their Souls in a <HI>Fire</HI> of Agony. In this <HI>Fire,</HI> and <HI>Fright,</HI> Oh, the sorrow for <HI>Sin,</HI> and hatred of it, Oh, the hope in Christ, and love to God, and re∣solutions never to Sin on any Terms any more, which these Wretches have now <HI>Show'd</HI> unto me. I could scarce imagine it possible for any but Regenerate Souls to speak so sen∣sibly well; many of these have been <HI>Repriev∣ed,</HI> and <HI>Pardoned</HI> by the Government; but of them all I never knew two, but what proved afterwards meer <HI>Devils Incarnate.</HI> All I will add is This; If men be not Religious in <HI>Pro∣sperity,</HI> as well as in <HI>Adversity,</HI> there is no true <HI>Life</HI> of Religion in them. They that never <HI>stir,</HI> but in the <HI>Fire,</HI> let them then <HI>stir</HI> never so pro∣misingly, are yet <HI>alienated from the Life of God.</HI> O my Soul, Read, Psal. 78. 34, 36.</P>

<HEAD>On the Fate of the Wood successively Laid on the Fire.</HEAD>
<P>I Call to mind a Remarkable thing prophe∣cied and promised, Zech. 12 6 <HI>I will make the Governours of Judah, like an Hearth of Fire among the Wood, and they shall devour all the peo∣ple
<PB N="90" REF="001067_0090_0FAEF59C51499920"/>
round about.</HI> Many Sticks and Logs of <HI>Wood,</HI> cast on an <HI>Hearth of Fire,</HI> seem to threa∣ten the Suppression and Extinction of the <HI>Fire.</HI> But the <HI>Fire</HI> is not so to be suppressed; no, the <HI>Wood</HI> it self shall be consumed; and let never so many parcels of it be brought one after another, they shall all be in like manner consumed.</P>
<P>The Enemies of the Church, are cast by Satan, upon it, with an Intention to suppress it, cover it, bury it, and smother it for ever. But all the Enemies, whether <HI>Seducers,</HI> or <HI>Oppressors,</HI> that are by Satan cast upon it, shall be but like Sticks and Logs of <HI>Wood,</HI> thrown upon an <HI>Hearth of Fire;</HI> instead of putting out the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ, they shall be destroy'd every one of them. The Experience of all Ages, has notably demon∣strated, and Illustrated this Observation; That the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ, has been like an <HI>Hearth of Fire,</HI> unto all its Adversaries; They that have Adversaried the Church, have but cast themselves like <HI>Wood upon an Hearth of Fire:</HI> At the long run, they have put out nothing; but been them∣selves Devoured.</P>
<P>If my Friends now <HI>Sitting by the Fire side,</HI> will pursue this observation, by falling into a Discourse upon the <HI>History,</HI> that will verify it, they will fall upon a Noble Subject, and Employ themselves a thousand times more
<PB N="91" REF="001067_0091_0FAEF59EC25C10A0"/>
profitably then if they should make <HI>Slanders</HI> or <HI>Satyrs</HI> upon their absent <HI>Neighbours</HI> to be their Entertainment.</P>
<P>I will only add; That <HI>Governours</HI> (or per∣sons in Authority) appearing for the Evange∣lical Interests, have a very particular Encou∣ragement, in this Oracle of God. They, a∣bove others, must expect, That many pieces of <HI>Wood</HI> will fall upon them. Yet let them not be discouraged, for, <HI>They who fight against them, shall not prevail against them.</HI> Reform∣ing Magistrates, and all Eminent Reformers, will, thro' the wonderful Providence of God, prove like an <HI>Hearth of Fire,</HI> to the <HI>Wood</HI> that goes to keep them under.</P>

<P>WHen I Sit by a very <HI>Strong Fire,</HI> and see and feel the Terrible <HI>Glowing</HI> of it, I call to mind the most memorable Story of the <HI>Three Worthies,</HI> who, because they would not worship <HI>Nebuchadnezzars</HI> Golden Image, (perhaps a remembrance of the Image, by which the <HI>Four Monarchies</HI> has been in his Dream represented unto him) were cast into
<PB N="92" REF="001067_0092_0FAEF59FBA2475E0"/>
a <HI>Fiery Furnace,</HI> made seven times more <HI>Fiery</HI> than ordinary: But, behold! The astonished Emperour, observing the effect of his own cruel Edict, cried out, <HI>Lo, I see Four men loose, walking in the midst of the Fire, and they have no Hurt; and the Form of the Fourth, is like the Son of God.</HI> If any ask, where was <HI>Daniel</HI> himself at this time, that he should bear no part in the <HI>Miracle?</HI> I find this Question ask'd in the <HI>Jewish Talmuds,</HI> and one Answer there given, is, That he was then sent into <HI>Egypt,</HI> upon a public Negotiation. But now, while I behold the Fierceness of the <HI>Fire</HI> on my <HI>Hearth,</HI> [or in the Stove] Heated beyond what is use to be, and how Unhabitable, and Intolerable a place, the midst of that <HI>Fire is,</HI> I will a little Divert my self with a <HI>Meditati∣on,</HI> on the <HI>Miracle</HI> thus wrought in that <HI>Fiery Furnace,</HI> where the <HI>Three Martyrs,</HI> as the Apo∣stle speaks, Heb. 11. 34. <HI>Quenched the violence of Fire.</HI> And here in the first place, I cannot but Enquire, Whom did the <HI>Chaldean</HI> Empe∣rour understand by, <HI>The Son of God,</HI> when he so called the Illustrious person, that he saw in the midst of the <HI>Fire?</HI> Now, for the satisfa∣ction of this Enquiry, I am informed, That the Learned <HI>Gentiles</HI> of old, illuminated with such a Tradition from the <HI>Jews,</HI> had some Apprehensions, not only of <HI>One</HI> Supream <HI>Deity,</HI> but also of a <HI>Trinity</HI> in this <HI>Deity.</HI> The <HI>Chal∣deans</HI> particularly had some rude Apprehensi∣ons
<PB N="93" REF="001067_0093_0FAEF59FCCF13F68"/>
of this Mystery, and their King was doubtless well versed in their Mysterious Do∣ctrine. <HI>Pythagoras</HI> that Lived among them, owns it: and the <HI>Oracles</HI> of the <HI>Chaldoeans,</HI> the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> mentioned by <HI>Hierocles, Damasci∣us, Porphyrie,</HI> and other profess'd Pagans assert. That the World was made by <HI>Three,</HI> and that a <HI>Trinity,</HI> whose <HI>Head</HI> was an <HI>Unity Shines thro' all things.</HI> The Names by which they distinguished the <HI>Three,</HI> in this <HI>Trinity,</HI> were, <HI>Oromasdes,</HI> (whom they expresly call'd, <HI>The Father,</HI> which implies, <HI>A Son,</HI>) and <HI>Mithras,</HI> (which they sometimes called, <HI>Mether,</HI> &amp; <HI>Ma∣ther,</HI>) &amp; <HI>Arimanes,</HI> (which they also called <HI>Armi∣anius,</HI>) on each of which they look'd, as on <HI>God Almighty,</HI> &amp; the <HI>Creator</HI> of the World. Antiquity assures us, That from the <HI>Mithras,</HI> (whom they styled, <HI>The Second Mind</HI>) the <HI>Persians</HI> did use to call any <HI>Mediator</HI> by that very Name. I will not recite here, what notable hints we find in <HI>Plutarch</HI> particularly, concerning these things. I hasten to add, They often understood the <HI>Sun</HI> by <HI>Mithras;</HI> but then they had yet an higher Notion of him, as, <HI>The Maker of all things,</HI> and therefore of the <HI>Sun</HI> it self. They distinguished between, <HI>The Intellectual Sun,</HI> and, <HI>The Visible Sun;</HI> as 'tis evident from the Orations of <HI>Julian,</HI> who calls the <HI>Second</HI> in their <HI>Trinity,</HI> by the Name of, <HI>The Sun.</HI> Com∣pare Mal 4. 2.] They fancied the <HI>Sun</HI> to be the Representation of that <HI>Second,</HI> as the <HI>Fire</HI>
<PB N="94" REF="001067_0094_0FAEF5A09640E640"/>
to be the Representation of the <HI>Sun.</HI> 'Tis probable, That <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> in his Image did represent the <HI>Sun,</HI> the usual <HI>Idol</HI> of the <HI>Babylonians;</HI> &amp; that the Representation might be the more compleat, the <HI>Fire</HI> of an horri∣ble <HI>Furnace</HI> (devoted unto the Service of that <HI>Idol</HI>) was added hereunto. Those that would not worship the <HI>Sun,</HI> the Idolaters of those A∣ges, did use to cast into the <HI>Fire:</HI> and the <HI>Jews</HI> tell us, that <HI>Abrahams</HI> coming out of <HI>Ur,</HI> was his being delivered out of this <HI>Fiery Trial.</HI> Such a <HI>Fire</HI> was now near unto the <HI>Image</HI> Erected by <HI>Nebuchadnezzar;</HI> and pro∣bably the Idolaters, would have them to be worship'd <HI>Both together:</HI> for which cause the Three Confessors here answered, <HI>We will not Serve thy Gods,</HI> in the plural Number. Now <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> seeing in the <HI>Furnace,</HI> a Fourth, who was of a glorious Appearance, a Tran∣scendent Majesty, a Countenance more than Humane, he might imagine, That this was most likely to be the <HI>Intellectual Sun,</HI> the <HI>Second Principle</HI> of their <HI>Trinity;</HI> whom his Coun∣try men, as <HI>Porphyrie</HI> in the Life of <HI>Pythagoras</HI> tells us, held for to be like <HI>Light</HI> without, &amp; like <HI>Truth</HI> within; and the <HI>Mediator</HI> between <HI>Spirit</HI> and <HI>Matter.</HI> Hence, 'twas very Na∣tural for him to cry out, <HI>The Form of the Fourth, is like the Son of God.</HI> But lest it be thought, that the glare of that <HI>Fire</HI> has <HI>daz∣zled</HI> me, I will now pass on to observe, what
<PB N="95" REF="001067_0095_0FAEF5A18D942688"/>
it is that preserves, and supports, and upholds the people of God, when they are cast into the most <HI>Heated Fire</HI> of <HI>Affliction:</HI> It is the <HI>Special Presence</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ. The Lord Jesus Christ, the <HI>Son of God,</HI> by His Ho∣ly <HI>Spirit,</HI> wonderfully visits the Hearts of His Children, when they are in the <HI>Hottest Fire</HI> of <HI>Affliction,</HI> and especially when their <HI>Afflicti∣on</HI> is that of <HI>Persecution</HI> for their Fidelity to their Lord. It is one of His promises, Isai. 43. 2. <HI>I will be with thee; when thou walkest thro' the Fire, thou shalt not be burnt, neither shall the Flame kindle upon thee.</HI> Our Lord Jesus Christ being thus <HI>present</HI> with His Faithful Ones, by His Holy <HI>Spirit,</HI> applying His Pro∣mises to them, &amp; injecting of Divine Consolati∣ons into their minds, they don't feel the force of the <HI>Fire,</HI> they are as if nothing ail'd them, &amp; they Enjoy more of true <HI>Liberty,</HI> than if they were out of the Furnace. <HI>The Divine Consolations of the Martyrs,</HI> are the wonder and the proverb of Christianity: The <HI>Martyr Books</HI> are filled with amazing Instances. We find some of them, Triumphing in the midst of horrid <HI>Flames;</HI> and I have had the pleasure to be acquainted with a <HI>French Protestant,</HI> who from the midst of a thousand inexpressible miseries, at the bottom of a doleful and a dismal Dun∣geon, in <HI>France,</HI> wrote this among very many charming passages to his Wife, then in this Countrey, <Q>My Soul is swallowed up in a

<P>We are to suppose a stately <HI>Edifice;</HI> the <HI>Walls</HI> whereof are of <HI>Marble</HI> and <HI>precious Stones;</HI> the <HI>Pillars</HI> are partly of <HI>Gold,</HI> and partly of <HI>Silver;</HI> the <HI>Boards</HI> are of choice <HI>Wood.</HI> Tho' the <HI>Roof</HI> of such an <HI>Edifice,</HI> do not use to be Thatch'd with <HI>Hay and Stubble,</HI> yet such may be the Fault of the <HI>Teachers</HI> in the Churches, as to make it so.</P>
<P>Now the <HI>Work,</HI> that men have thus been doing about the <HI>Doctrine</HI> of Christianity. <HI>The Day shall declare it.</HI></P>

<P>And now, <HI>O my Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> I make it my earnest <HI>Prayer</HI> unto Thee, That if thou Accept me, and Employ me, to write <HI>Books</HI> for the Service of thy Churches, Thou wouldst mercifully preserve me from writing any thing, that will not <HI>Endure the Fire.</HI> Let me never Advance any thing as a Doctrine of Christianity, that shall be <HI>Hay and Stubble;</HI> but what shall remain Eternal <HI>Gold,</HI> after the most Critical, Accurate, Exquisite, and <HI>Fiery</HI> Examination of it.</P>

<HEAD>On the Torment of the fire.</HEAD>
<P>I Do not Approach to the <HI>Fire,</HI> so near as to meddle with it, without being made sensible, That the <HI>Torment</HI> of being Burnt in the <HI>Fire,</HI> is very Terrible; perhaps no <HI>Torment</HI> so very Terrible! Being sensible hereof, I cannot but give Thanks to God, for preserving <HI>me</HI> and <HI>mine,</HI> from the painful Affliction of being scorch'd in the <HI>Fire;</HI> which is an Affliction, that from one Disaster or another, men do often fall into. But then, I do also with Astonishment call to mind, the Courage of those <HI>Martyrs,</HI> who have courageously and cheerfully undergone the Torment of <HI>Burning,</HI> for their Faithfulness to the Truths and Wayes of our Lord Jesus Christ. It was of old said, <HI>Isa. 24. 15. Glori∣fie ye the Lord in the Fires, even the Name of the Lord God of Israel in the Isles of the Sea.</HI> Truly, in the <HI>British Isles of the Sea,</HI> more than on any part of the Earth beside, there have been called forth <HI>Martyrs,</HI> in the strictest sense, to <HI>Glorifie the Lord in the Fires.</HI> The popish and monstrous Figment of <HI>Transsub∣stantiation,</HI> and the Abominable Doctrines depending on it, was formerly endeavoured there to be thrust down the Throats of Good men with <HI>Burning Five brands.</HI> That Sham

It was a wonderful Operation of the Holy Spi∣rit, on the minds of those brave Christians, That rather than they would pollute their Souls, by Denying the Evangelical <HI>Truths,</HI> wherewith Heaven had illuminated them, or by practising the Antichristian <HI>Wayes</HI> of Ido∣latry, they would Expose their <HI>Flesh</HI> to all the horrible Torment of <HI>Burning</HI> to Death. Cer∣tainly, these <HI>Heroic</HI> Souls had a very power∣ful <HI>Fear</HI> of the Divine Anger, to avoid which they were not <HI>Afraid</HI> of the cruel <HI>Flames;</HI> and certainly, they had a very powerful <HI>Faith</HI> of their own Resurrection from the <HI>Ashes,</HI> &amp; of a State of Heavenly <HI>Blessedness</HI> both before and after the <HI>Resurrection,</HI> or they would not so cheerfully have gone to the <HI>Flames</HI> that made <HI>Ashes</HI> of them. The Martyr <HI>Bilney,</HI> the Night before his <HI>Burning,</HI> thrust his Finger into the <HI>Fire,</HI> to try whether it could be born or no. Now I am Sitting before my <HI>Fire,</HI> I am Trying, whether I should be able to bear <HI>Burning</HI> for the Cause of God. <HI>Lord, I can∣not, I cannot! except thy Spirit strengthen me: But, O Omnipotent Spirit, thro' thee strengthening of me, I can do all Things,</HI> And I do also
<PB N="101" REF="001067_0101_0FAEF5A74B0A08D8"/>
think, 'Tis Better to <HI>Burn</HI> for the Sake of the Lord Jesus Christ, than to incur the Fate of that Apostate, who gave that as the Reason for his Apostasy, <HI>I cannot Burn, I cannot Burn!</HI> and behold he was quickly <HI>Burnt</HI> unto Death in his own House casually <HI>Fired</HI> over his Head. Nor may I forget the words of the Martyr <HI>Hooper</HI> the Night before be dyed: <HI>When I think of the Fire. I begin to be afraid, for I fear how the Fire will burn; but when I think of the Fire of Hell; the Fear of Eternal Fire, makes me willing to Endure a Temporary Fire!</HI> While I adore the Almighty <HI>Spirit,</HI> Which <HI>possessing</HI> of the <HI>Martyrs,</HI> carried them forth unto this Elevated pitch of Christianity, I cannot but make some Reflection upon a∣nother Wonder, which is also to be ascribed unto a <HI>Possession</HI> of the same <HI>Spirit of God, and of Glory</HI> When the Martyr <HI>Hawks</HI> gave to his Distressed Friends, a sign that he found the <HI>Flames</HI> to be Tolerable enough, it present∣ly turn'd their Distress, into a Rapture of Admiration and Satisfaction. But then, with what surprize must one have heard the <HI>Mar∣tyr Baynham</HI> in the <HI>Flames</HI> cry out, <HI>I feel no more pain, than if you strow'd Roses under my feet!</HI> Indeed some of the Martyrs, especial∣ly <HI>Hooper</HI> and <HI>Ridley,</HI> (who had once been too <HI>Fiery</HI> in their treating one another,) felt <HI>Anguish</HI> enough in the <HI>Fire.</HI> But some of them it seems had such an <HI>Efficacy</HI> from Hea∣ven

<P>Indeed the Ancients considered an Higher Mystery in this <HI>Burning Bush;</HI> They consider∣ed it, as a Figure of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> wherein the <HI>Bush</HI> of His Humanity, is possessed, and yet not consumed, by His <HI>Divinity,</HI> which is, <HI>A Consuming Fire.</HI> Thus <HI>'tis Gregories</HI> gloss up∣on it, <HI>Per Succensum Rubum ostensum est, quod ex illo populo exiret, qui Igne Deitatis carnis no∣stroe Naturam, quasi Rubi Spinam, acciperet; et inconsumptam Humanitatis substantiam, in ip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Divinitatis Flamma servaret.</HI></P>
<P>But we will at present, rather take this <HI>Burning Bush,</HI> to be the <HI>Church</HI> of the <HI>Messiah;</HI> and we will now say with <HI>Moses, I will now turn aside, and see this Great Sight.</HI> The Thing which is to be seen, is This; <HI>That although the Church of our Lord Jesus Christ, be like a Bush all on Fire, yet this Glorious Bush will never be consumed, but be gloriously Preserved, Rescued, and Enlarged.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Church</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ, is on a diverse account fitly compared unto a <HI>Bush.</HI> Particularly, There is much <HI>Lowness,</HI> much Meanness, much Contempt, Commonly at∣tending
<PB N="104" REF="001067_0104_0FAEF5A989263960"/>
the <HI>Church</HI> of our Lord. It is called, <HI>A Low Tree.</HI> Tho' the <HI>Church</HI> have no less a Lustre than that of the <HI>Moon</HI> in Heaven, be∣longing to it; yet in outward Appearance, and in vulgar, Opinion, the <HI>Church</HI> is a poor <HI>Bush;</HI> yea, the All wise Dispensations of Hea∣ven, towards the Church on Earth, have u∣sually been such, that there has been room for that Complaint, <HI>We are brought very Low.</HI> The <HI>Church</HI> is therefore in the Visions of <HI>Ze∣chariah styled, A Myrtle grove; a Myrtle</HI> is but a low and a mean sort of a <HI>Shrub.</HI> As the <HI>Church</HI> has but low and mean thoughts of it self, and the Members thereof do not aspire to be in Worldly Grandure, like the proud <HI>Oaks of Bashan,</HI> so Worldly people have but low and mean thoughts of the Church, and look upon it, like the proud King, upon, <HI>The Thistle in Lebanon.</HI></P>
<P>Again, 'Tis a <HI>Dangerous</HI> thing, for any to fall foul on the <HI>Church</HI> of our Lord. The <HI>Bush</HI> wherein there was given a picture of the <HI>Church,</HI> was one, as the Hebrew word intimates, that had <HI>prickles</HI> on it: And we are told by Travellers, the <HI>Bushes</HI> thereabouts, are so <HI>prick∣ly,</HI> that if a <HI>Bird</HI> Light on one of them, he can hardly scape without a Deplumation. This we may be sure of; They that go to wrong the <HI>Church</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, will find it a <HI>prickly,</HI> tearing and wounding thing. Indeed, it is not the Disposition of them
<PB N="105" REF="001067_0105_0FAEF5AA51F74DE0"/>
that are the genuine Children of the Church, to do Hurt for Harm; and much less to be, <HI>as Thorns, which the man that shall touch, must be fenced with Iron, and the Staff of a Spear.</HI> But it is the happiness and privi∣ledge of the <HI>Church,</HI> that through the jealous Care of God concerning it, its Adversaries do not find it safe to meddle with it; its <HI>Motto</HI> is, <HI>Nemo me impune Lacessit.</HI> A certain little <HI>Benjamite,</HI> was once <HI>Ravening like a Wolf</HI> on the Church of our Lord; but he was told from Heaven, <HI>That he was kicking against the pricks.</HI> Many a man sets himself to molest the <HI>Church</HI> of God; he thinks, He'll <HI>handle them without Mittens!</HI> But those fool hardy creatures procure miserable Scratches to them∣selves, by what they do. All that have hi∣therto gone to damnify this <HI>Bush,</HI> tho' as big men, as <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> or a <HI>Senacherib,</HI> the <HI>Bush</HI> hath scratch'd them to Death; yea, the Al∣mighty God has taken this <HI>Bush</HI> and scourg'd its Adversaries to Death, with its <HI>Tribulations.</HI> Vain men! Lay Hands on this <HI>Bush,</HI> if you Dare: Consider what you do; 'Twill <HI>tear you to pieces,</HI> and there shall <HI>be none to deliver you.</HI></P>
<P>But we past on to observe, That the <HI>Church</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ, is a <HI>Bush on Fire: Lord, preserve me from ever adding Oyl unto the Flame!</HI> For, first, there is the <HI>Fire</HI> of <HI>Affliction,</HI> which the <HI>Church</HI> of our Lord must Encoun∣ter withal all <HI>Affliction</HI> is compared unto
<PB N="106" REF="001067_0106_0FAEF5AD23B799B8"/>
<HI>Fire;</HI> but especially, an <HI>Affliction</HI> by the Judg∣ments of God rendred <HI>Epidemical: which sets people on Fire round about and burneth them:</HI> And most of all, <HI>Persecution;</HI> wherein men are <HI>Scorched,</HI> and <HI>Fall by Flame.</HI> Now, the Name of the <HI>Church</HI> all along hath been, <HI>O Thou Afflicted:</HI> And there never was a Time, wherein they that would <HI>Live Godlily,</HI> did not in some respect or other, <HI>Suffer</HI> P<HI>ersecuti∣on.</HI> The <HI>Church</HI> must not, <HI>think strange of a Fiery Trial.</HI> If I am never so little a Twig of the <HI>Burning Bush,</HI> I must have the Sanctify∣ing <HI>Fire of Affliction</HI> on my Enjoyments; I must at last Fly into Heaven out of such a <HI>Fire,</HI> if ever I would <HI>Enter into Life.</HI> There is also the <HI>Fire</HI> of <HI>Contention,</HI> wherein the <HI>Church</HI> of our Lord is too often Embroiled. When a <HI>Strife</HI> arises any where, there is a <HI>Fire</HI> in that <HI>Strife.</HI> There is a certain <HI>Heat</HI> of Spirit, and an <HI>Heart-burn,</HI> enkindled among those that Quarrel with one another; and in their <HI>Lips, there is as Burning Fire.</HI> Alas, for the <HI>Flames,</HI> that have all along Raged in the <HI>Church</HI> of God! The scandalous <HI>Contention,</HI> that hath set the Church on <HI>Fire</HI> in every pe∣riod! We cannot all see with the same eyes; and God for Holy Ends, has left His people to buffet one another in the dark. I am sor∣ry to say it, but it is too notorious to be de∣nied, (and the <HI>Jews</HI> themselves have taken so much Notice of it, as to pretend, that this
<PB N="107" REF="001067_0107_0FAEF5AE15789500"/>
is one thing that prejudices them against Christianity) the <HI>Church</HI> has generally been under the Reproach of that wretchedness, <HI>Thro' the Wrath of the Lord of Hosts, the Land is darkened, and the people shall be as the Fuel of the Fire.</HI> Old <HI>Adams</HI> World must have <HI>Thorns</HI> in it: and that we may remember, we are not arrived unto the Second <HI>Adams</HI> World, the <HI>Church</HI> must have its <HI>Thorns,</HI> in the Treats, which we rashly give to one another. Yea, the <HI>Bush</HI> of the Lord has been, in its <HI>Dayes of Temptation,</HI> too like a <HI>Bramble bush,</HI> from whence a <HI>Fire has gone forth to devour the Cedars of Lebanon.</HI> In the Primitive <HI>Church</HI> of the New-Testament, how early did the Apostles complain, <HI>I hear there are Divisions among you!</HI> It was not long before they fell to <HI>Haeretica∣ting</HI> and <HI>Excommunicating</HI> one another; and the <HI>Schisms</HI> arose, that Burn, like the unquen∣chable <HI>Fire of Hell,</HI> to this very day. Even in the <HI>Church</HI> of the Reformation, how ma∣ny <HI>Divisions</HI> have arisen, which have been managed with so much <HI>Fire,</HI> that as the Jesuite writes, concerning the Books of the <HI>Lutherans</HI> against the <HI>Calvinists, You would think you saw, not men, but so many Devils engaging one another!</HI> Lord, make me a man of a <HI>cool Spirit,</HI> and, <HI>Libera me ab implacabilibus Theologorum Odijs.</HI></P>
<P>And now, Let me <HI>behold</HI> the <HI>Church</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, as a <HI>Bush not consumed,</HI> but gloriously preserved in the midst of the <HI>Fire,</HI>
<PB N="108" REF="001067_0108_0FAEF5AF18EF7BE0"/>
and give to the Churches Lord, the Glory of its preservation. It is <HI>de facto,</HI> sensible unto us, That our Lord has at this day a <HI>Church</HI> on Earth, yea, this <HI>Church</HI> has been in some degree always <HI>visible.</HI> I would, <HI>behold this great sight,</HI> with raptures and wonders, and thousands of Praises to that Lord, of whom <HI>having obtained Help the Church continues to this day.</HI> But why is not the <HI>Bush consumed?</HI> When the <HI>Bush</HI> was once all on a Light <HI>Fire,</HI> it gave this Account of it, <HI>It is of the Lords mercies, that we are not consumed.</HI> The <HI>presence</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, with His <HI>Church,</HI> is the <HI>Churches grand preservative.</HI> When the <HI>Burning Bush</HI> was <HI>not consumed,</HI> we read, there was, <HI>The Angel of the Lord,</HI> in that <HI>Flame of Fire.</HI> It seems to have been, that <HI>Angel,</HI> who is, <HI>The Lord;</HI> even our Lord <HI>Messiah</HI> Himself; an <HI>Angel,</HI> whose Name is, <HI>Jehovah,</HI> and, <HI>I am that I am,</HI> There is no Fear, the <HI>Church</HI> will be <HI>Consumed.</HI> so long as it has the <HI>presence</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, for the Safeguard of it. We read, of, <HI>The Good will of Him that dwelt in the Bush.</HI> I would sing of that <HI>Good Will,</HI> as the <HI>First Cause,</HI> why the <HI>Bush</HI> is <HI>not consumed.</HI> This <HI>Bush</HI> we have an order to Sing unto it, as unto that <HI>Vine, I the Lord keep it! I will keep it night and day.</HI> The <HI>Church</HI> is no other than that Number of men. Whom God the Father has given unto the <HI>Messiah,</HI> to be the Spectators, and Partakers of His <HI>Glory.</HI>
<PB N="109" REF="001067_0109_0FAEF5B058931788"/>
The Spirit of the <HI>Messiah</HI> is therefore, always at Work, to maintain this Church of His; and can it be lost? No; All the <HI>High Trees</HI> in the World, have been and shall be <HI>consumed,</HI> but,<HI>O Bush of the Lord, Thou shalt Endure, and thy years shall have no End.</HI> Why, Because thy Lord Himself <HI>Endures:</HI> The Name of the <HI>Bush is Jehovah Shammah.</HI> And, <HI>Si nos rui∣mus, ruit et Christ us.</HI></P>
<P>But then the <HI>Angels</HI> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, are the <HI>Guardians</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> &amp; the <HI>Instruments</HI> of preserving it. They were on Mount Sinai, and are on <HI>Mount Sion!</HI> Tho the <HI>Angels</HI> are <HI>Seraphims,</HI> or <HI>Burners,</HI> they help to keep the <HI>Bush,</HI> that it shall not be <HI>Burnt.</HI> A notable piece of the <HI>Bush,</HI> namely, <HI>Daniel,</HI> had been <HI>Consumed;</HI> if it had not been for <HI>Angels.</HI> Though the <HI>Bush</HI> be among <HI>Lions,</HI> that would pull it up by the Roots, and may say, <HI>I ly among them that are set on Fire,</HI> yet the <HI>Angels</HI> defend it. The <HI>Burning Bush</HI> is not <HI>consumed,</HI> because the <HI>Angels</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, are a <HI>Wall of Fire</HI> about it: <HI>Hezekiah</HI> saw once, what one <HI>Angel</HI> was able to do: <HI>One Angel</HI> gave Daniel to see him do great Things for the Bush. Did not an <HI>Angel</HI> once hew down an huge <HI>Tree,</HI> that hurt the B<HI>ush!</HI> And what can't the vast Legions, and Armies of those bright Spirits do?</P>
<P>I would no more then, be discouraged; but Hopefully and Joyfully Believe, That the
<PB N="110" REF="001067_0110_0FAEF5B06575C090"/>
<HI>Church</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ shall be still preserved. <HI>Uzziahs</HI> unbelief about the <HI>Ark</HI> I would not admit about the Bush. No, I expect, That the B<HI>urning</HI> B<HI>ush</HI> will very quick∣ly become a <HI>Tree,</HI> the <HI>Heighth whereof will reach to Heaven, and the sight thereof to the End of all the Earth.</HI> Most certainly, The Day is at Hand, where the <HI>Bush of God, will take deep Root, and fill the Earth; Hills will be covered with the Shadow of it, and the Boughs thereof will be like the Goodly Cedars</HI> But then 'tis al∣so to be expected. That the Implacable Ad∣versaries of the B<HI>urning</HI> B<HI>ush,</HI> will be them▪ selves consumed, by the B<HI>urning Wrath</HI> of God.

<HEAD>On the Kindling of a Fire in the Lords Day.</HEAD>
<P>If Works of <HI>Necessity</HI> and of <HI>Compassion,</HI> may be done on the Sabbath, which is a Day set apart for the <HI>Services of Religion,</HI> and not allowing <HI>Servile Offices</HI> to be done upon it; the <HI>Kindling</HI> of my <HI>Fire</HI> this Day, which is our <HI>Christian Sabbath,</HI> altho' it were done for the Relict of my <HI>Flesh,</HI> is not to be Num∣bred
<PB N="111" REF="001067_0111_0FAEF5B111BF7118"/>
among the <HI>Works of the</HI> F<HI>lesh:</HI> If there were a <HI>Necessity</HI> of my Attending the <HI>Services of Religion</HI> this Day, there was a <HI>Necessity</HI> of my defending my self by a <HI>Fire</HI> against the <HI>Cold,</HI> that would else have crampt those Holy <HI>Services:</HI> And while I am En∣gaged herein, such is the <HI>Compassion</HI> of the Lord, who will have <HI>Mercy rather than Sacri∣fice,</HI> that He permits my Interior to treat my Exterior, with the <HI>Compassion</HI> of a <HI>Fire</HI> pro∣vided, without which my <HI>Sacrifice</HI> had been that of a F<HI>ool.</HI> But if it were proper to <HI>Kin∣dle</HI> a F<HI>ire,</HI> on the <HI>Sabbath,</HI> I am sure, it will not be less proper to Employ and Apply my F<HI>ire</HI> unto the Sacred purposes, which are most of all proper to the <HI>Sabbath;</HI> and let the F<HI>ire kindle</HI> in my Soul, those <HI>Thoughts,</HI> by which the <HI>Sabbath</HI> will be Sanctifyed.</P>
<P>Now the first Entertainment, offered unto my Thoughts on this occasion, is, that prohi∣bition, which the Lord gave, in Exod. 35. 3. <HI>ye shall kindle no</HI> F<HI>ire, throughout your Habitati∣ons upon the Sabbath Day.</HI> I might have known, tho' <HI>Munster</HI> had not informed me, that the <HI>Jews</HI> take this precept in the Letter, &amp; there∣fore Hire <HI>Christians</HI> to kindle their F<HI>ire</HI> on the <HI>Sabbath.</HI> But I remember, That the <HI>Priests</HI> were to Burn the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of the <HI>Sabbath,</HI> which could not be done without the kindling of a F<HI>ire;</HI> for tho' the F<HI>ire</HI> which came down from Heaven was constantly upon the <HI>Altar,</HI>
<PB N="112" REF="001067_0112_0FAEF5B1CBACA5C0"/>
where it continued until it was Renewed in the <HI>Temple,</HI> which they call'd, <HI>The House of E∣ternity;</HI> yet by a daily supply of <HI>New</HI>F<HI>uel,</HI> was that F<HI>ire</HI> maintained. The <HI>Priests</HI> were to <HI>Lay Wood every morning</HI> on it, and so soon as the <HI>Old</HI> F<HI>ire</HI> had scattered the particles which it prey'd upon, a <HI>New</HI> F<HI>ire</HI> must needs be kindled. The Remembrance hereof in∣clines me to the Judgment of some Learned men; <Q>That the Text under consideration must not be taken in that Latitude, which at the first view it seems to have. And if it must have some limitation, it cannot better be Restrained than to what is Expressed in the Context. The Thing treated of, is, <HI>The Work of the Tabernacle.</HI> Though many Cautions had been given, concerning the Forbearance of <HI>Servile Work</HI> on the <HI>Sabbath</HI> upon any private Account, yet some would be ready to think, that work tending to the preparing of Materials for the composing of that Sacred Thing, the <HI>Tabernacle,</HI> might be lawful. For the prevention of such Thoughts, before the Description of what was Requisite, in Entred upon, this precept is laid down, That in order to any such Work, whether the melting of Silver, Gold, or any other Metal, which might be neces∣sary about the <HI>Sanctuary,</HI> not to much as a F<HI>ire</HI> should be kindled.</Q></P>
<P>But be this prohibition understood, one

way or t'other, as the different Inclination of mens <HI>Understanding</HI> may carry them; 'Tis evident from it, That a <HI>Sabbath</HI> is to be <HI>San∣ctified.</HI> We are assured, <HI>Gen.</HI> 2 3. That from the <HI>Creation</HI> of the World, God <HI>Sanctified the Seventh Day,</HI> or commanded that it should be Separated, and Dedicated, unto Sacred Ser∣vices, How? Surely not meerly be ordering that it should be kept Holy by the little Na∣tion of <HI>Israel,</HI> twenty four hundred years af∣terwards. No, the Patriarchs long before <HI>Is∣rael.</HI> did use to keep an Holy Sabbath, Even, [Heb. 4. 11.] <HI>from the Foundations of the World.</HI> And some think, that <HI>Noah</HI> in the <HI>Ark,</HI> [Gen.8. 8, 10, 12.] had respect unto such an <HI>Holy Sabbath.</HI> Very Positive is the <HI>Fourth Commandment</HI> in the <HI>Law</HI> of our God, <HI>Remember the Sabbath Day to keep it Holy;</HI> But how often must a <HI>Sabbath Day</HI> Recur? It fol∣lows; <HI>Six Dayes thou shalt labour, and do all thy work, but the Seventh Day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God.</HI> It must be <HI>One Day in Seven;</HI> but the Specification of which Day, must be Left unto the <HI>Lord our God:</HI> the Command∣ment refers no more to the <HI>Saturday Sabbath,</HI> than to the <HI>Sunday Sabbath.</HI> There is cause to suspect, That the <HI>Weekly Sabbath</HI> was utter∣ly lost, among the <HI>Israelites,</HI> in the Time of their <HI>Egyptian</HI> Captivity and Idolatry; and by consequence, that the true <HI>Seventh Day</HI> from the Creation, could not easily be Reco∣vered,
<PB N="114" REF="001067_0114_0FAEF5B3485E9FB8"/>
for do but Read the <HI>Stromes of Clemens Alexandrinus,</HI> and you will be satisfied, That no Nation but <HI>Israel,</HI> for many Ages after the Dayes of <HI>Moses,</HI> had any such measure of Time, as that of <HI>Weeks,</HI> among them, When the Great <HI>Lord of Time,</HI> Revived a∣mong His People, the observation of an <HI>Ho∣ly Time</HI> unto Himself, in a <HI>Weekly Sabbath,</HI> it was the <HI>Seventh Day,</HI> from the Falling of <HI>Man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> in the Desert; and from thence for∣ward, the <HI>Seventh Day</HI> as often as it recurred, was to be the <HI>Weekly Sabbath,</HI> in the Church of God; until the Coming of Him, in whom the <HI>Man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> hath its Antitype. The Sovereign <HI>Lord,</HI> who hath Honoured the Number <HI>Se∣ven,</HI> with Great <HI>Mysteries</HI> and <HI>Periods</HI> running upon it, hath required a <HI>Seventh part</HI> of our <HI>Time</HI> to be kept <HI>Holy</HI> unto Himself. But our Lord JESUS CHRIST, who is the <HI>Lord of the Sabbath,</HI> and of that Grand <HI>Millennial Sabbatism,</HI> whereof our <HI>Weekly Sabbath,</HI> is a praefiguration, hath directed us, now to keep for our <HI>Weekly Sabbath,</HI> another Day, even the Day following that which the <HI>Israelites</HI> were directed unto: and we are not <HI>sure,</HI> that those Learned men are mistaken, who <HI>think,</HI> that this our <HI>Christian Sabbath,</HI> is the true <HI>Seventh Day</HI> from the <HI>Creation.</HI> Our Lord Jesus Christ lay in His Grave, all the Day of the <HI>Jewish Sabbath,</HI> and in that <HI>Grave</HI> it was Buried for ever; His <HI>Rising</HI> out of His <HI>Grave,</HI>

No; There is a <HI>Day</HI> of the Week, which the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> hath expresly called, [Rev. 1. 10.] <HI>The Lords Day.</HI> That by the LORDS DAY, is meant no other than the same <HI>Day</HI> of the Week,
<PB N="116" REF="001067_0116_0FAEF5B4F2882C28"/>
which we now call so, we have as much E∣vidence, as that HMEPA KYPIAKH signi∣fies, <HI>The Lords Day;</HI> the Evidence of <HI>Inconte∣stable Tradition. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> therefore in his E∣pistle to the <HI>Magn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/></HI> which was written within Eight or Ten Years, after <HI>Johns</HI> Wri∣ting his <HI>Revelation,</HI> has these memorable words, <HI>That instead of the Jewish Sabbaths, we should keep the</HI> LORDS DAY, <HI>on which our Life Ros<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from the Dead.</HI> And this Day, can be called, <HI>The Lords Day,</HI> for no other cause but because it is to be <HI>kept Holy unto the Lord,</HI></P>
<P>Well then; If it were <HI>no Fault</HI> in me, to kindle my <HI>Fire</HI> on the <HI>Lords-Day,</HI> certainly 'twill be <HI>no Fault</HI> in me, if my zeal to keep the <HI>Lords Day,</HI> be now enkindled into a <HI>vehe∣ment Flame.</HI> If the Question were put unto a Christian in the Primitive Times, <HI>Domini∣sum Servasts?</HI> Do you keep the <HI>Lords Day?</HI> His Answer would be, <HI>Christianus sum, inter∣mittere non possum,</HI> I am a <HI>Christian,</HI> and there∣fore I dare do no other. Truly our <HI>Christia∣nity</HI> obliges us to keep the <HI>Lords-Day;</HI> and our <HI>Christianity</HI> will either Flourish or Wither, ac∣cording to our keeping of it. While I have my <HI>Fire</HI> now before me, to preserve me from chilling in the Devotions of the <HI>Lords Day,</HI> I will venture to say, The <HI>Lords Day,</HI> is as a <HI>Fire</HI> unto all our other Devotions. It is a sad Remark, to be made upon too many Church∣es of the <HI>Reformation,</HI> which in this point want
<PB N="117" REF="001067_0117_0FAEF5B807EBC948"/>
still very much to be <HI>Reformed.</HI> They indulge themselves in loose <HI>Principles,</HI> and in loose <HI>Practices,</HI> about the <HI>Lords Day;</HI> and it is to be observed, That the Holy <HI>Religion</HI> of our Lord, which is this Day, most of all to be <HI>Inculcated</HI> as well as <HI>Exemplified,</HI> has by this <HI>loosness</HI> of theirs been exceedingly damni∣fied; There is too little of the <HI>Power of God∣liness</HI> to be seen in those Churches, tho' the <HI>Doctrine of Godliness</HI> be still held and preach'd among them. They have called, The strict Celebration of the <HI>Lords; Day, Figmentum Angli∣canum,</HI> an <HI>English Fiction.</HI> But it is no <HI>Fiction,</HI> that <HI>England</HI> &amp; <HI>Scotland</HI> where the <HI>Lords Day</HI> is kept better than in the other Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> have had more of the <HI>Power of Godliness,</HI> than all the other Nations. And those other Nations, as they have broken <HI>Gods Rest,</HI> so God has bro∣ken <HI>Theirs;</HI> astonishing plagues have been <HI>dis∣resting,</HI> and <HI>distressing</HI> of them. A Worthy Divine, as many years ago as the Dayes of my Grandfather, seeing in Print, an humble Confession of the Sins, that had brought up∣on <HI>Germany</HI> the Troubles then harassing of it, said, <HI>I see the Troubles of</HI> Germany <HI>are not over yet, I see no Confession of their Sabbath breaking!</HI> And the Event has confirmed it. If we would Thrive on <HI>Temporal</HI> Accounts, we shall find the due Celebration of the <HI>Lords Day</HI> ve∣ry much contribute unto it. It is said, <HI>If thou call the Sabbath a Delight, and the Holy of
<PB N="118" REF="001067_0118_0FAEF5B8F7967418"/>
the Lord, I will cause thee to Ride upon the Migh places of the Earth.</HI> It has been the Remark of some Judicious Observers, That their <HI>Suc∣cess</HI> usually is as their <HI>Sabbath</HI> is, and from their keeping of the <HI>Lords Day,</HI> they can form a probable conjecture, how it will fare with them all the Ensuing <HI>Week.</HI> But much more, if we would Thrive on <HI>Spiritual</HI> Accounts, Let us be <HI>in the Spirit on the Lords Day,</HI> and our <HI>Spirits</HI> will reap an incredible advantage from it. We shall be <HI>made Joyful in the House of Prayer,</HI> by vast accessions of Light, and Life, and Joy, unto our Souls, if we duely improve the <HI>Market</HI> for such Good Things, which is on the <HI>Lords-Day</HI> held among us. What shall I say more? May I believe that word of God, Isa.56. 2. <HI>Blessed is the man who keeps my Sabbath, from polluting of it.</HI> The Sin of <HI>Sabbath breaking</HI> should be terrible to me, since I hear that Thunder once utter∣ed from Heaven, by the God of Heaven, <HI>Ye bring fierce wrath, by profaning the Sabbath.</HI> I am now sitting by the <HI>Fire</HI> kindled on the <HI>Sabbath;</HI> but I am led now to think on a <HI>Fire</HI> to be kindled against them, who break the <HI>Sabbath:</HI> I find it threatned, Jer. 17. 22. <HI>If you will not hearken unto me, to Sanctifie the Sabbath day, Then will I kindle a Fire, and it shall devour, and it shall not be quenched.</HI></P>
<P>May I then have my Heart <HI>Inflamed</HI> with an <HI>Holy Zeal,</HI> to keep the <HI>Lords-Day</HI> with an
<PB N="119" REF="001067_0119_0FAEF5BA07047A70"/>
Exemplary <HI>Holiness.</HI> Let me on this <HI>High Day</HI> not allow my self in <HI>Low</HI> Employments; but let me Employ my self in <HI>Heavenly</HI> Ex∣ercises and <HI>Meditations;</HI> and as far as I can, let me be <HI>in the Spirit on the Lords-Day.</HI></P>
<P>But one of the <HI>Meditations</HI> wherewith es∣pecially I would Entertain my self on, <HI>The Lords Day,</HI> shall be, <HI>That Sabbatism,</HI> whereof our <HI>Weekly Sabbath</HI> is a Figure, and a Sym∣bol: Even that <HI>Sabbatism,</HI> whereof one of the glorious Characters will be, <HI>That no Fire shall be kindled on it:</HI> all <HI>War</HI> shall then cease; and there will be an uninterrupted, and in∣terminable <HI>peace,</HI> among the people of God. Until the arrival of that Blessed <HI>Sabbatism,</HI> there will always be much <HI>Fire</HI> in the world; yea, and in the <HI>Church;</HI> Even that worst <HI>Fire</HI> of Contention. But in that <HI>Sabbatism,</HI> they <HI>Learn War no more;</HI> The Holy <HI>Spirit</HI> of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> will then marvellously possess, and instruct, and unite, His people: Yea, the <HI>Prince of Peace</HI> Himself, will visibly appear, at the Beginning of that <HI>Sabbatism,</HI> and the <HI>Sign of the Son of Man appearing,</HI> all Nations will <HI>with one accord,</HI> yield Subjection to the <HI>Father</HI> of that <HI>World to come.</HI> It is an Incompara∣ble, and a most agreeable <HI>Sabbath Work,</HI> to be swallow'd up with Contemplations of that great <HI>Sabbatism:</HI> the Approach of it, the Nature of it.

<HEAD>On the Coals.</HEAD>
<P>I Know not, whether there are more <HI>Coals</HI> at this Time, in my <HI>Fire,</HI> than there are <HI>Thoughts,</HI> in my mind, which may take <HI>Fire</HI> from them. <HI>Lord, Graciously and Mercifully Touch my Pen with a Coal from thine Altar, that so it may in an Holy strain write some of those Things, which a polluted Sinner, that yet serves at thine Altar, is now for that Service Meditating.</HI></P>
<P>And now, first, Methinks, I should be as loth to commit a <HI>Sin,</HI> as to handle a <HI>Coal.</HI> If I should go to take up a <HI>Coal</HI> in my Hand, it would both <HI>Smutt</HI> me, and <HI>Scorch</HI>me. I am certain, a <HI>Sin</HI> taken into my Heart, would have the like, and worse effects upon me. E∣very <HI>Sin</HI> is of a <HI>Filthy</HI> consequence, and by it, even the <HI>Conscience is defiled.</HI> And <HI>Sin</HI> ad∣mitted, and allowed, will scald the <HI>Conscience,</HI> at last into as much anguish, as ever the bloo∣dy hand of <HI>Ravilliac,</HI> burning with his Knife in it, suffered at his Execution. Oh, that I were now as much afraid of every
<PB N="121" REF="001067_0121_0FAEF5BB8E4749E8"/>
<HI>Sin,</HI> and all the <HI>Works of the Flesh,</HI> as of a <HI>Coal</HI> to be clapt upon my <HI>Flesh.</HI> The Purest Na∣zarites, once contaminated with <HI>Sins</HI> against the Holy Laws of God, may have that <HI>La∣mentation</HI> made upon them, Lam. 4 8. <HI>Their Visage is now blacker than a Coal.</HI> Wherefore, Let me take heed, lest I Blacken my self by the <HI>Coals,</HI> and not <HI>Abhorring that which is E∣vil,</HI> It is the Wise mans Disswasive, relating to the particular Sins of <HI>Unchastity,</HI> Prov. 6. 27, 28. <HI>Can a man take Fire in his Bosom, and his Cloaths not be burnt? Can one go upon hot Coals, and his Feet not be burnt? So,</HI>—Now let me by this Consideration, be Disswaded and Affrighted from all other <HI>Sins. They are so many Coals; why should I meddle with them!</HI> I remember Old <HI>Mela,</HI> in his Book, <HI>De Situ Orbis,</HI> tells of a silly people, who had not known <HI>Fire,</HI> and when they first saw it, they were so taken with it, as to <HI>Embrace</HI> it, until it horribly burnt 'em. O my Soul, Thou knowest, that <HI>Sin</HI> is a <HI>Coal;</HI> it will infalliby do thee a <HI>Damage;</HI> be not then like that sil∣ly people; keep at a due distance from such a Dangerous Evil. What a Frozen Creature am I? A principle, as cold, as the Venemous Juice, with which the <HI>Salamander</HI> does Extin∣guish the ardent <HI>Coals</HI> on which it is cast, [whence the <HI>Vulgar Error,</HI> of its Living in the <HI>Fire]</HI> surely hath possession of me, or else I should esteem every Sin, too dangerous a
<PB N="122" REF="001067_0122_0FAEF5BC535DAFF8"/>
Thing for me to be free withal. It surpriz∣es the Spectators, to see Jugglers, put ardent <HI>Coals</HI> into their <HI>Mouths:</HI> But is it not more surprizing, that mens <HI>mouths</HI> are filled with Offences against the Holy God! There are Contrivances, which the Writers of such Cu∣riosies do suggest; How men may with∣out Harm take up ardent <HI>Coals</HI> into their <HI>Hands:</HI> But I never could see it contrived, how men may <HI>Work Wickedness</HI> with their <HI>Hands</HI> &amp; not bring upon themselves a mischief,</P>
<P>While I am in this Meditation, I call to mind, the parable, by which the Sins of <HI>Di∣shonesty,</HI> have been sometimes painted out un∣to us. To carry <HI>Burning Coals into his Nest,</HI> was in the issue, no Advantage to the <HI>Thievish Bird of Prey.</HI> Should I convey an Handful of these <HI>Burning Coals,</HI> into the Boxes, where∣ly my Papers, and the best of my other Trea∣sures, what mad work should I make! Truly, those men, that add unto their Estates, by Fraudulence, by Oppression, by any <HI>Dishone∣sty,</HI> do but convey <HI>Burning Coals</HI> among all their Treasures; and what, may we foresee, will be the Issue? <HI>He gets Riches, and not by Right, He shall leave them in the midst of his Days, and at his End shall be a Fool.</HI></P>
<P>And yet, there is a sort of <HI>Coals,</HI> that we may become free withal. 'Tis required, Prov. 25. 21, 22, [And repeated, Rom. 12. 20.] <HI>If thine Enemy be Hungry, give him Bread
<PB N="123" REF="001067_0123_0FAEF5BD37A32230"/>
to eat; and if he be Thirsty, give him Water to Drink; for thou shalt heap Coals of Fire on his Head, and the Lord shall Reward thee.</HI> The Lord help his poor Servant, ever to avoid all <HI>Revenge</HI> upon <HI>Personal Enemies;</HI> but rather to Wish them, and Do them, all the <HI>Good</HI> that is possible for their <HI>Evil</HI> It were a very lamentable Thing, for a Christian who hath suffered any <HI>Injuries,</HI> and <HI>Reproaches,</HI> to mani∣fest his Forgiving of his <HI>Personal Enemies,</HI> by making those very <HI>Injuries,</HI> to be the occasions of his <HI>Praying</HI> by Name for <HI>them,</HI> for whom it may be, he never so pray'd before. And Christianity will be further Exemplified, if we don't <HI>Shun,</HI> but rather <HI>Watch,</HI> all opportuni∣ties to show <HI>Kindnesses</HI> unto them, that have been most <HI>Unkind</HI> unto us. But how will this, <HI>Heap Coals of Fire on the Heads of</HI> of my Adversaries? If I should Answer, That then the <HI>Righteous God,</HI> will take my Adversaries into His Hand, and <HI>Revenge</HI> the wrongs done to me, with Judgments that shall fall as <HI>Burn∣ing Coals</HI> upon them that have wronged me, the Answer would be true; but I must have a care of having this Intention, in my silence, my patience, my forbearing to <HI>Retaliate.</HI> Wherefore, I will rather put a sweeter sense upon it. My <HI>Gentleness</HI> towards my Adver∣saries, will perhaps <HI>melt</HI> their <HI>Hearts,</HI> as much as if <HI>Coals of Fire</HI> were thrown upon them; and the <HI>Envy</HI> and <HI>Maliee,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

treat me, will become as uneasy to themselves as if <HI>Coals of Fire</HI> were Lying on their <HI>Heads,</HI> and the Torment which a Reflection on their own past <HI>Baseness</HI> towards me, will give unto them, will be as bad as if <HI>Coals of Fire</HI> were vexing of them. All I shall add, is, That it is an hard Lesson, which is now prescribed unto me; &amp; therefore, even with the ardour of <HI>Coals of Fire,</HI> I would pray, as the Dis∣ciples of our Lord once did, on the Hearing of this Lesson, <HI>Lord, Increase my Faith.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Upon some Dead Coals.</HEAD>
<P>THough the <HI>Dead Coals</HI> on the <HI>Hearth,</HI> will not <HI>Warm</HI> ones <HI>Exteriour,</HI> I will try whe∣ther my <HI>Interiour</HI> can't fetch as much <HI>Warmth</HI> from them, as from the <HI>Living</HI> ones. I am therefore from these <HI>Dead Coals,</HI> to receive some <HI>Living Admonitions.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Dead Coal,</HI> would first most naturally put one in mind, of a <HI>Dead man.</HI> The <HI>Extinction</HI> of a <HI>Coal,</HI> does (at least as with a Coal) draw a Picture of <HI>Mortality.</HI> And she that had but one Son, being afraid of his <HI>Death,</HI> Expressed her Fear, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 14. 7. of <HI>Quenching the Coal that was left.</HI> Now, when I see how much longer some <HI>Coals</HI> do last, than others, it in∣vites me to think, how <HI>Long Lived</HI> some, in
<PB N="125" REF="001067_0125_0FAEF5C1D4EF40C0"/>
comparison of others, are. Since the unac∣countable <HI>Abbreviation</HI> of Humane Life, unto the Term, at which it hath stood for near Four Thousand years, we see, That while some <HI>Coals</HI> are put out by thousands of Accidents, <HI>before their Time,</HI> there are men who not only Live to the Term of <HI>Threescore years and Ten,</HI> but also keep some Light and Heat, unto a much Greater Age; yea, and this although they never took such a <HI>Temperate &amp; Accurate</HI> way of Living, as did the famous <HI>Cornaro,</HI> to <HI>prolong their Lives.</HI> Though the Countreyes where they Live most meanly and hardly, are the Countreys where they generally live the longest; and hence the Gentleman, who this present year [1700.] Published, An Account of the Islands of <HI>Orkney,</HI> mentions it as no rare thing for People <HI>there</HI> to live unto a very great Age; and that among other Instances which are no Rarities, a Gentleman is yet living at <HI>Strousa</HI> there, whose Father begat him, when he was One hundred years old, and lived until he saw this mans Children: Yet all Coun∣treys have afforded some Exemples of <HI>Long<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣vity.</HI> To Recite the <HI>Exemples,</HI> would be to transcribe and pillage, whole Chapters, from those who have written <HI>Curiosities.</HI> I will only make just so much Improvement of this Re∣flection, as to say, That for the Duration of my <HI>Life,</HI> I entirely Refer it, and Submit it, unto the God of <HI>my Life,</HI> the God, who is the
<PB N="126" REF="001067_0126_0FAEF5C2E6CAAA00"/>
Author and Giver of my <HI>Life.</HI> So far as the <HI>Fear of God</HI> will <HI>prolong my Life,</HI> and so far as <HI>Abstinence,</HI> and <HI>Patience,</HI> will (as beyond all <HI>Elixirs</HI> they will!) contribute unto it, I am desirous to make use thereof. But, I am far from Desirous, to be so long from the Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>(where to be is by far the best of all, 7128)</HI> as I see some of my pious Neighbours are; And I am very Desirous that my <HI>Life</HI> may not last any longer than my <HI>Work.</HI> Where∣as also my <HI>Broken Health</HI> Exceedingly forbids me the least Expectation of being a <HI>Macrobius,</HI> and, <HI>Non Annis sed Factis vivunt mortales, tis my</HI> earnest Prayer, <HI>Lord, let me live long in a little Time!</HI> and if I am to Dy quickly, I wish I may be worthy of that Epitaph, <HI>Diu vixit, licet non diu fuit.</HI></P>
<P>But seeing a <HI>Dead Coal,</HI> I enquire, what made it so? And this <HI>Enkindles</HI> another Thought. If the <HI>Dead Coal</HI> were lying among the <HI>Living</HI> ones, it would be no longer so <HI>Dead. Lively Christians</HI> in like manner (say I) keep one another <HI>Alive,</HI> by being <HI>Together.</HI> The <HI>Company</HI> and the <HI>Conference</HI> of <HI>Lively Christians,</HI> has a mighty Tendency to keep Christianity <HI>Alive</HI> among them. A <HI>Dead,</HI> Stu∣pid, Formal Frame of Spirit, is the usual Effect of keeping at a Distance from the Society of <HI>Lively Christians.</HI> It has been particularly found, that <HI>Religious Meetings</HI> wisely managed, have had a more than ordinary tendency to
<PB N="127" REF="001067_0127_0FAEF5C30B9F4010"/>
preserve the <HI>Life</HI> of <HI>Religion</HI> among a People. Wherefore, let those <HI>Pastors,</HI> that would ap∣prove themselves Faithful unto the Interests of <HI>Religion</HI> in their Flocks, Countenance and En∣courage <HI>Religious Meetings,</HI> for <HI>Prayers,</HI> and <HI>Re∣peting of Sermons,</HI> and for <HI>Discoursing</HI> on the Things of God. And let them very peculiarly direct and Excite their <HI>Young People,</HI> to the maintaining of such <HI>Meetings.</HI> It will be found that the <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> of <HI>Godliness</HI> will be marvellously maintained by such Things, And it will be found, That where persons withdraw from the Fellowship of <HI>Lively Christians,</HI> and <HI>Forsake the Assembling of them∣selves together,</HI> it won't be long before the <HI>Coals goe out.</HI> May I value and enjoy the <HI>Fel∣lowship</HI> of <HI>Lively Christians;</HI> and may I, by Se∣rious and Modest, and Fruitful <HI>Speeches</HI> in their Fellowship, both have and give those things, upon which it shall be said, <HI>While we spoke, did not our Hearts burn within us!</HI></P>

<HI>Blowing,</HI> it seems, the <HI>Fire</HI> will not <HI>Burn.</HI> I suppose it will be allow'd me, That the <HI>Fire</HI> shall be a <HI>lively Metaphor</HI> of <HI>Prayer,</HI> be∣cause it is a <HI>Divine</HI> One. In allusion to the <HI>Fire</HI> on the <HI>Altars,</HI> it was said, <HI>The Smoke of the Incense, which came with the Prayers of the Saints, ascended up before God:</HI> And alluding to that Morning a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>! Evening <HI>Fire,</HI> it is Enjoin∣ed on the Masters of Families, <HI>Continue in Prayer.</HI> The <HI>Warmth</HI> requisite unto <HI>Prayer,</HI> and the <HI>Heaven ward motion</HI> of it, [For, What is <HI>Prayer,</HI> but, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>;] are e∣nough to <HI>Embolden</HI> the <HI>Metaphor.</HI> But alas, what ado must there be, to make this <HI>Fire</HI> burn? There must be a deal of <HI>Blowing</HI> up∣on me, as by the <HI>Providence</HI> of God, so by His Holy <HI>Spirit,</HI> before by <HI>Prayer</HI> will be in∣flamed into a proper <HI>Ardor.</HI> This Thought falls in well enough. The <HI>Spirit</HI> of God, is by the <HI>Son</HI> of God, <HI>from whom</HI> He does <HI>pro∣ceed,</HI> compared unto the <HI>Wind,</HI> and there are many Elegancies, to favour the Comparison. There must now be a work of that Holy <HI>Spirit</HI> on a man, before it can be said of the man, <HI>Behold he prays!</HI> And <HI>He</HI> is, for that Reason styled, <HI>The Spirit of Prayer;</HI> and it is assigned, as <HI>His</HI> Office, to <HI>Help our Infirmities</HI> in that eminent Act of Religion. I am sure, There is need enough, of such a work: For I shall not see the <HI>Excellency</HI> and <HI>Necessity</HI> of the Good Things, for which I am to <HI>Pray,</HI>
<PB N="129" REF="001067_0129_0FAEF5C48F1294E0"/>
except the Holy <HI>Spirit Convince</HI> me thereof; nor shall I Exert those <HI>Graces,</HI> wherewith God in the Lord Jesus Christ is to be acknow∣ledged when I <HI>Pray,</HI> except the Holy <HI>Spirit</HI> both Infuse those <HI>Graces,</HI> and Excite them and Assist them. We are commanded ex∣pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, <HI>To pray by the Holy Spirit;</HI> which if it had been a Gift <HI>Miraculous</HI> or <HI>Extraordinary,</HI> or to cease after the Apostolical Age, the A∣postle would never have Exhorted <HI>All Chri∣stians</HI> to Exercise it. For any to <HI>Deride, Pray∣ing by the Holy Spirit;</HI> cannot but be very dangerously to <HI>Blaspheme</HI> one of His peculiar Operations. I wish, that my <HI>Prayers</HI> then may be such, as <HI>Nazi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nzen</HI> relates the <HI>Prayers</HI> of his Father made at the <HI>Eucharist,</HI> were; <HI>Made by the Holy Spirit of God</HI> And, <HI>Lord, keep me from grieving, and vexing thy Holy Spirit, by indulging my self in Sin, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t He withdrawing from me, leave me under all the Calamities of a Prayerless and a Frozen Soul! But, Oh, Thou Holy Spirit, Blow thou upon this Dead Heart of mine: and, Quicken me, that I may call upon thy Name.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Blast</HI> of this Meditation is no soener over, but another succeeds. Having only a little <HI>Coal,</HI> and indeed scarce a <HI>Coal,</HI> but a <HI>Spark,</HI> before me, to <HI>Blow,</HI> I find, That if I <HI>Blow</HI> it with <HI>Fury</HI> and <HI>Fierceness,</HI> I shall utterly Lose it. But I must therefore <HI>Blow</HI> it very Gently; and with a little <HI>Gentleness</HI> in my

<P>In this Thing I have an Admonition gi∣ven me, How <HI>Reproofs</HI> are often to be mana∣ged: Even like the <HI>Bellows,</HI> with a <HI>Gentle Blast.</HI> When our Neighbours do amiss, 'tis our Duty to Advise them, caution them, and <HI>Reprove</HI> them.

<HEAD>On the Flame.</HEAD>
<P>To Look much on the <HI>Flame,</HI> is perhaps not Good for the <HI>Eyes;</HI> but it will be Good for my Soul, when Looking on the <HI>Flame,</HI> to think on that Glorious Lord, in the Description of whom, 'tis one Article, <HI>Rev.</HI>1. 14 <HI>His Eyes are as a Flame of Fire.</HI> Indeed, our Lord JESUS CHRIST is repre∣sented, as <HI>Cloathed with Fire.</HI> For when we read, in the Vision which the Prophet <HI>Ezeki∣el</HI> had of Him, <HI>From the Appearance of His Loins even upward, and from the Appearance of His Loins even downward, I saw as it were the Appearance of Fire;</HI> I do with <HI>Vitringa</HI> under∣stand it, of the Flammeous Colour and As∣pect, of the <HI>Toga Talaris,</HI> or long Priestly Gar∣ment, wherein our Lord appeared. And, <HI>Omnia Dei sunt Flammea.</HI> Accordingly, as it would put out my <HI>Eyes,</HI> if I pore too near the <HI>Fire</HI> with them, so it would be as peril∣lous as Criminal a <HI>Curiosity</HI> in me, to approach too near unto the <HI>Divine Majesty</HI> of the Son of God; with presumptuous Enquiri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s after what is not Revealed: And, <HI>Scrutator Maje∣statis opprimetur a gloria.</HI> But that the <HI>Eyes</HI> of our Illustrious Lord are more peculiarly compared unto a <HI>Flame of Fire,</HI> This is a Thing that af∣fords
<PB N="132" REF="001067_0132_0FAEF49B891B6BC0"/>
peculiar Instructions unto us. And there are especially two Things wherein I am here instructed. First, I am to Remem∣ber, That the <HI>Eyes</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, penetrate into the most secret Recesses ima∣ginable. The <HI>Eyes</HI> of that <HI>Omniscient Lord,</HI> penetrate like <HI>Lightning,</HI> which is a <HI>Flame of Fire,</HI> into the most Remote and Hidden Cor∣ners in the World. He needs no other <HI>Light,</HI> but that of His own <HI>Eyes</HI> which are a <HI>Flame of Fire,</HI> to discover the darkest matters. Oh, let me Study to Approve my Heart, with all Sincerity, unto that Lord, who because <HI>He hath Eyes like a Flame of Fire,</HI> will <HI>make all the Churches to know, that He Searches the Reins and the Hearts of the</HI> Children of men. I am al∣so to Remember, That there will be no Stan∣ding for Wicked men or Things, before the <HI>Eyes</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ. The <HI>Eyes</HI> of that <HI>Omnipotent Lord,</HI> will dart forth Judg∣ments, like a <HI>Flame of</HI> F<HI>ire,</HI> upon those that shall oppose His Interests. Great Wrath will, as both <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> take notice of it, produce a F<HI>lame of Fire</HI> in the <HI>Eyes.</HI> Let me take he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d of provoking the Lord Jesus Christ, lest He that has <HI>Eyes like a Flame of Fire,</HI> do Revenge the provocations, by shoot∣ing forth <HI>Fiery</HI> Emanations of His Displea∣sure.</P>
<P><HI>Teach me,</HI> O L<HI>ord, always to behave my self as before the Eyes of a Lord, that hath Eyes like a Flame of Fire</HI></P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="001067_0133_0FAEF49C694D9008"/>
But I may, without any Difficulty in the <HI>Transition,</HI> pass over from hence to a Contem∣plation of those Blessed Spirits, the ANGELS, of whom it is said, Heb. 17. <HI>They are a</HI> F<HI>lame of Fire:</HI> And this the rather, because it is also said, of <HI>Them,</HI> Zech. 4. 10. <HI>They are the Eyes of the Lord.</HI> The <HI>Angels</HI> of God, even those Wonderful and Excellent Spirits, which com∣pose the <HI>Heavenly Host,</HI> are very fitly called, <HI>Seraphim,</HI> or, Burners, for their F<HI>laming Zeal,</HI> as well as upon other accounts. And he that would approve himself an <HI>Angelical</HI> man, (which the <HI>Pastors</HI> of Churches, who are cal∣led <HI>Angels,</HI> are concerned above others to do) must be a man of a F<HI>laming Zeal</HI> for God, and for His Truths, and for His Wayes, and a∣gainst the Sin that is Offensive to Him. 'Tis very certain, That there are <HI>Good Angels,</HI> e∣ven Rational Substances, which are Spirits, that were made by God, in the Beginning of Time, for His own more special Service and Honour. This is doubted by none, but men under an horrible possession of the <HI>Evil</HI> Ones. That there are <HI>Evil Angels,</HI> we have had a∣mong our selves more than Mathematical De∣monstration; and this is an Irrefragable De∣monstration, That there are <HI>Good</HI> Ones too. Tho' <HI>Moses</HI> do not expresly mention the <HI>An∣gels,</HI> in his History of the Creation. yet the Repetition of that History in the Hundred and Fourth Psalm seems to make an Express
<PB N="134" REF="001067_0134_0FAEF49D05E24960"/>
mention of them. Indeed, the Nature, the Office, the Degrees of <HI>Angels,</HI> do come on to our observation, by slow Degrees in the Book of God. The Story of the Bible is carried on Two Thousand years, even as far down as the Dayes of <HI>Abraham,</HI> e're we find any <HI>Angels</HI> visibly Exhibiting themselves unto the World. The Coming of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> the Lord of <HI>Angels,</HI> is in the Sacred Story, made somewhat plain, before the <HI>Angels</HI> themselves are much Exhibited in these Oracles. And possibly, towards the End of the World, the Truths concerning <HI>Angels,</HI> will be marvellously recovered, out of the <HI>Darkness</HI> as yet upon them, and more Discovered unto the People of God, than ever since the World began. However the <HI>Angels</HI> are now mentioned a∣bove two Hundred and sixty times in the <HI>Bible</HI> of God; and it becomes all that Enjoy the <HI>Bible,</HI> not only to Believe, but also to Study, with a due Modesty, the Ministry of <HI>Angels</HI> for the Chosen of God, under the Conduct of our Lord Jesus Christ. Now, in the <HI>Scrip∣tures of Truth,</HI> 'tis abundantly intimated, That the <HI>Good Angels</HI> do compose an <HI>Heavenly Army,</HI> and there is a most <HI>Heavenly Order</HI> in that <HI>Army.</HI> Possibly the <HI>Order</HI> wherein the <HI>Army</HI> of <HI>Israel</HI> in the Wilderness, was disposed, might be a little imitation of it; and the Al∣mighty God might be called, <HI>The Lord of Hosts,</HI> with relation unto both. The <HI>Traditio∣nal</HI>

and <HI>Platenical</HI> Spec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ations o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>Ancients,</HI> and the Vanity of the Schoolmen, who are <HI>vainly puff'd up in their fleshly mind,</HI> in their Determinations, about the <HI>Angels,</HI> afford a poor Direction to our Thoughts upon them. If we <HI>Speak not according to the Testimony</HI> of the <HI>Scripture,</HI> when we Speak about the <HI>Angels of Light,</HI> it is because <HI>there is no</HI> L<HI>ight in us</HI> Now the <HI>Scripture</HI> doth assure us, That there is at¦least one <HI>Archangel,</HI> and the Name of that <HI>Archangel,</HI> is <HI>Michael,</HI> a Confession of the matchless Majesty in God. But some appre∣hend, no less than <HI>Seven Archangels,</HI> [From Rev 3. 1.] and I do my self incline to that Apprehension. There are <HI>Angels</HI> also that seem to be under the more Influences of these <HI>Leaders,</HI> who with their <HI>Leaders,</HI> are all un∣der the Command of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, the <HI>Lord of Glory.</HI> Yea, there are <HI>Multitudes,</HI> vast <HI>Myriads</HI> and <HI>Millions</HI> of them: <HI>An Innumerable Company.</HI> If the <HI>Saints</HI> of God, who are to fill up the Room left in Heaven, by the <HI>Fallen Angels,</HI> be a <HI>Great mul∣titude, which no man can number,</HI> what may we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ustly suppose the <HI>Number</HI> of the <HI>Good Angels?</HI> The <HI>Bad Angels</HI> are so many, that sometimes a <HI>Numerous Crue,</HI> have been at Liesure to vex one miserable man How <HI>Numberless</HI> then may we suppose the <HI>Good Angels,</HI> from whom these are but a <HI>Crue of Deserters</HI> and <HI>Revolters?</HI> When our Lord spoke of His Father sending

<HI>Twelve</HI> L<HI>egions</HI> of <HI>Angels,</HI> it was not because His Father had no more; but only because there was none but Himself, and His Eleven Disciples, to be then protected, and a <HI>Legion</HI> a piece, every one would own, was Protecti∣on enough. Now a <HI>Legion</HI> according to <HI>Ve∣getius,</HI> did consist of 6100 Footmen, and 726 Horsemen, Here then are supposed more than Fourscore Thousand <HI>Angels.</HI> But in∣deed, There are <HI>Thousands of Thousands!</HI> And so many, that without making any Breach, upon that vast Congregation of <HI>Angels,</HI> which are Day and Night about the Lord in His Temple, every <HI>Elect person</HI> may have at least <HI>One Angel,</HI> (whether always the same, or no, is questionable) by the special Deputation of Heaven, to be with him, Defend him, Direct him all the Dayes of his Pilgrimage. The Scripture is plain, for their having <HI>Their An∣gels;</HI> and the Church of God in the First Ages, were fully of this Opinion. Well then, If I give Thanks to God, for the Bene∣fits which I receive in the <HI>Flames</HI> on my <HI>Hearth,</HI> what Thanks do I owe unto God, for these <HI>Heavenly Flames of Fire,</HI> which are the Ministers, from whom His Faithful Servants do receive inestimable <HI>Benefits?</HI> The <HI>Good Angels,</HI> consider, That their Everlasting Lord is a <HI>Man,</HI> yea, that it is a <HI>Man</HI> United unto the <HI>Second Person</HI> in God, and Lying in the Bosom of the Infinite God for ever: and that
<PB N="137" REF="001067_0137_0FAEF4A1C12CB478"/>
the <HI>Welfare</HI> of <HI>man,</HI> is a thing full of Satisfaction to that <HI>man,</HI> who is God as well as man, Accordingly, at the Command of the Lord Jesus Christ, they Fly swiftly, like <HI>Flames</HI> of rapid <HI>Fire,</HI> to do for His people, those <HI>Good Offices,</HI> About which they will more fully inform us, when we shortly a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tive a∣mong them. There are many <HI>Evil Disasters,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en as many as <HI>Jobs</HI> of old, whereto we should be Exposed, if there were not the <HI>An∣gels of the Lord</HI> Encamping about us. How comes the Church in general to be <HI>Preserved?</HI> The Lord of old promised, <HI>A Wall of Fire;</HI> The meaning of That is, <HI>A Guard of Angels.</HI> They put many <HI>Good Notions,</HI> and <HI>Good Motions</HI> into our Minds, dissolving therewithal the <HI>Enchantments</HI> of the <HI>Wicked One,</HI> that else would be too hard for us. They prevent our Sinning against their and our <HI>Good God;</HI> and rate off the <HI>Lions</HI> that would else make a prey of us. They comfort us in our <HI>Dying Hours,</HI> and at our Death, carry off our Souls unto <HI>Paradise,</HI> in spite of the Efforts of the <HI>Prince of the power of the Air</HI> to imprison us; and at the <HI>Resurrection,</HI> they will be in yet more in∣conceivable wayes comfortable and servicea∣ble to us. The stupid Mortals, who are in∣sensible of such <HI>Good Offices,</HI> to be done by the <HI>Angels</HI> of God, for His <HI>Children,</HI> do <HI>Err, not knowing the Scriptures,</HI> Now the <HI>Angels</HI> do not expect our Thanks, unto <HI>Them,</HI> for
<PB N="138" REF="001067_0138_0FAEF4A24C814758"/>
these <HI>Good Offices,</HI> but unto the Lord Jesus Christ for them. Oh, that my Heart were more <HI>Inflamed</HI> with Gratitude unto the Lord, whose Goodness has favoured us, with such <HI>Flames of Fire,</HI> to be <HI> Ministring Spirits, sent forth to minister for them. Who shall be Heirs of Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>But then, how much concerned ought I to be, lest I provoke the <HI>Good Angels,</HI> and ren∣der my self obnexious to terrible strokes from these <HI>Flames of Fire.</HI> To forfeit their Assist∣ance, is calamity enough; What will it be then, to Incur their <HI>Displeasure?</HI> They are <HI>Mighty Angels,</HI> and one of them, has before now, made <HI>Mighty Armies,</HI> and <HI>Mighty Mo∣narchs,</HI> to fall before him; and it has been thereat cried out, <HI>Who among us shall dwell with the Devouring Fire? Who among us shall dwell with Everlasting Burnings?</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore, Let me avoid all <HI>Unholiness,</HI> lest the <HI>Holy Angel;</HI> be offended at me, It is a good Note of <HI>Chemnitius, Caveamus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e vit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> lmpuritate, hosce Sanctos Custodes a nob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s abiga∣mus.</HI> And now, Let behave my self as under the <HI>Eye of Angels;</HI> putting this unto my Conscience when I am tempted unto any vile Thing; <HI>Would I venture to do this, if an Angel clothed with a Flame of Fire, were visibly before me.</HI> Let me also labour to be <HI>Like</HI> the <HI>Angels,</HI> wholly Dedicated unto God, alwayes at work for God, and like a <HI>Flame of Fire,</HI> in

<P>We read of an <HI>Angel with a Flaming Sword.</HI> It is particularly said, Gen.3. 24.

<HEAD>On the Nimbleness of the Flame.</HEAD>
<P>I am looking after some <HI>Qualities</HI> of the <HI>Flame,</HI> to consider, with such <HI>Reflections,</HI> as may have a Tendency to encourage Good <HI>Qualities</HI> in us that are about it. And me∣thinks, the <HI>Nimbleness</HI> of it, gets before its o∣ther <HI>Qualities,</HI> and first offers it self to be con∣sidered. How <HI>Nimbly</HI> it moves? How <HI>Swift∣ly</HI> it proceeds! How <HI>Swiftly</HI> it Ascends! and gets beyond its <HI>Pyramidical</HI> Bounds, into the <HI>Invisible World!</HI> The <HI>Swiftness</HI> required unto the Pronunciation of that Verse, in the <HI>Dactyls</HI> whereof an Ingenious Person, did Poetically <HI>Limn</HI> out, (or, <HI>Sound</HI> out) the <HI>Nimble Flame, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erne Levem Stipulam <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>repitantibus urere flammis,</HI></P>

<P><HI>Delay</HI> not, O <HI>my Soul,</HI> to Reflect agreeably, My Work is to move and mount <HI>Upwards,</HI> until I am carried at length, into the <HI>Upper</HI> World, where the <HI>Eyes of Flesh</HI> that have seen me, shall see me no more; and the <HI>Ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> of these motions, is to be found in the <HI>Command∣ments</HI> of God, Let me now be <HI>Nimble</HI> in my Obedience to those Divine <HI>Commandments,</HI> and obey them with a Velocity, like that of <HI>Abra∣ham</HI>

of whom it was said, <HI>me rose Early to comply with the calls of Heaven,</HI> and of <HI>David,</HI> by whom it was said, <HI>I made Hast, and did not Delay,</HI> It hath been the Observation of some Eminent Preachers, That they rarely Preach with more <HI>Success,</HI> than when they Preach a∣bout the Danger and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lly, of mens <HI>Delay</HI> to Turn unto God. <HI>Lord, I mourn, that I have been so slow, and made it so long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re may Soul be∣gan to move upwara<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> I must with shame con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess <HI>Nimis Sero Te amav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> But since I am now,<HI>by the Grace of God, what I am,</HI> let me by the most Lively Sermons and Visits, labour to Quicken my Neighbours, unto the Activity of a <HI>Flame,</HI> in their Conversion to the Lord Je∣sus Christ.

<HEAD>On the Purity of the Flame.</HEAD>
<P>I must not yet lay aside my Conference, with the <HI>Flame. Its Purity,</HI> which admits nothing Heterogeneous, to lodge in it, would <HI>Stir up a pure mind,</HI> unto the <HI>Remembrance,</HI> of something that is much to be Desired. So <HI>Pure</HI> indeed is the <HI>Flame,</HI> that our English word <HI>Pure,</HI> seems derived from the Greek word of the same sound, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, which signifies, <HI>Fyre;</HI> and possibly the old Saxon word, <HI>Fyre,</HI> may be of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat Original. The <HI>Flame</HI> is <HI>Pure;</HI> and, <HI>Oh, that I were so too!</HI> The <HI>Purity</HI> of the <HI>Ascending Flame,</HI> does put one in mind, of a passage, in the famous <HI>Catechisim of David;</HI></P>
<P>Q.<HI>Who shall Ascend into the H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll of the Lord?</HI></P>
<P>A. <HI>He that hath a Pure Heart.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Pure Heart,</HI> like a <HI>Pure Flame,</HI> will admit nothing to be lodged in it, but what shall be of an Heavenly Tendency, and pleasing to the God of Heaven. And when I Learn from the Oracles of God, of what consequence it is to have, <HI>A pure Heart;</HI> particularly, <HI>That it shall be Blessed with the Sight of God;</HI> I will no

longer count it a Disgrace, to be, <HI>A Puritan.</HI></P>
<P>I have within me a <HI>Conscience,</HI> whereof, if I make, the <HI>Flame</HI> to be a Picture, I draw it by the <HI>Light</HI> of a Proverb, that fell from the Pen of <HI>Solomon, The Spirit of a man is the Candle of the Lord.</HI> But then I read of some, <HI>Whose Conscience is Defiled.</HI> Every <HI>Sin</HI> is a discompo∣sing of that <HI>Flame,</HI> with some Vile Pollution cast into it: And if <HI>Sin</HI> be not pardoned, and Removed, with the <HI>Blood</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ cast into the <HI>Flame,</HI> the <HI>Polluted Con∣science,</HI> will but Burn the more fiercely for it, throughout Eternal Ages.

<HEAD>On the Ascending of the Flame.</HEAD>
<P>ONe of the most visible Things about the F<HI>ire,</HI> is the F<HI>lame;</HI> and one of the most sensible Things about the F<HI>lame,</HI> is the <HI>Motion</HI> and <HI>Ascent</HI> of it. But our Hissing F<HI>lame,</HI> does not <HI>move upward,</HI> without calling upon us, as the Primitive Christians, when they were be∣ginning
<PB N="144" REF="001067_0144_0FAEF4A8ECB5E858"/>
their Acts of publick Worship, did use to be called upon, <HI>Sursum Corda!</HI> or, Let your <HI>Hearts move upward!</HI> If naturally the F<HI>lat side</HI> of my <HI>Heart</HI> Ly towards <HI>Heaven,</HI> and the <HI>Sharp side</HI> of it Ly towards <HI>Earth,</HI> I wish my <HI>Heart</HI> may be <HI>turned,</HI> even turned into the contrary posture of the F<HI>lame,</HI> which I am now thinking on. An <HI>Heavenly Tendency</HI> is the property of every Godly man; <HI>His Conversation is in Heaven</HI> May I now ex∣press it, in my own Desire and purpose to la∣bour after that property.</P>
<P>The <HI>motion</HI> of the Heart, is in its <HI>Thoughts,</HI> its Loves, its <HI>Hopes</HI> an its <HI>Joyes.</HI> May mine always be <HI>upward,</HI> and <HI>Heavenward Lord; Enflame this miserable Heart of mine, with thy Love, and it will be so!</HI></P>
<P>But a Christian that would keep a constant F<HI>lame</HI> of Devotion in his Heart, always <HI>As∣cending</HI> towards God and Christ and Heaven, cannot more effectually do so, than by filling every day of his Life, with that sort of <HI>Pray∣ers,</HI> which we call Ejacul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. By the Daily and Hourly Use of <HI>Ejaculatory Prayers,</HI> a Christian may have his Heart, like a F<HI>lame,</HI> continually mounting <HI>upward,</HI> unto the Hea∣vens, and <HI>Our Father which is in the Heavens.</HI></P>
<P>Now, It is impossible for me to mention all the Numerous, and indeed Numberless, <HI>Occasions,</HI> for <HI>Ejaculatory Prayers;</HI> but if a Christian will <HI>Watchfully</HI> improve such <HI>Occasi∣ons,</HI>
<PB N="145" REF="001067_0145_0FAEF4AA70750780"/>
as are now to be mentioned, he will be <HI>Taught of God,</HI> how to improve the rest.</P>
<P>A Christian has abundant <HI>Occasions</HI> for <HI>Eja∣culatory Petitions,</HI> both on the behalf of <HI>himself</HI> and of <HI>others.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Favours</HI> of God, for our <HI>Inward man,</HI> may on many <HI>Occasions</HI> be supplicated with our Ejaculations. As now; we may take Oc∣casions for such Ejaculations and <HI>Supplications,</HI> from the <HI>Ordinances</HI> of God. Before we set upon any signal <HI>Exercise</HI> of Religion, there is <HI>Occasion</HI> for some such <HI>Ejaculations,</HI> as That; O <HI>Lord, Assist me to draw water out of this Well of Salvation; or, Let the words of my mouth. and the thoughts of heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord.</HI> And all the while, we are in the <HI>Exercise,</HI> there is <HI>Occasion</HI> for multiplied <HI>Ejacu∣lations.</HI> While we are joining with another in <HI>Social Praying,</HI> we may fix our wandring hearts, by annexing such a pertinent <HI>Ejacula∣tion</HI> unto all that he utters, as, <HI>Lord, I own it!</HI> or, <HI>Lord, I ask it!</HI> When the Congregation that sat under our Lords Ministry, heard <HI>Him,</HI> (who was <HI>It</HI>) speaking about the <HI>Bread of Life,</HI> they presently made an <HI>Ejaculation</HI> upon it; <HI>Lord, give us this Bread for ever.</HI> Thus in the Hearing of a Good <HI>Sermon,</HI> a Studious <HI>Head,</HI> and a Gracious <HI>Heart,</HI> may tack a seri∣ous <HI>Ejaculation</HI> upon every thing that shall be offered.

<P>Furthermore, We may Supplicate the Fa∣vours of God, for our <HI>Outward man,</HI> by our <HI>Ejaculations</HI> on many <HI>Occasions.</HI> Every new matter of <HI>Care</HI> brings with it a new matter of <HI>Prayer.</HI> What shall we do, but by a short E∣<HI>jaculation</HI> carry it unto the Lord?

<P>To proceed; It is not seldom, that we have <HI>Occasions</HI> of <HI>Ejaculations</HI> for the Whole <HI>Church</HI> of God; That <HI>Ejaculation Lord, Save thy Peo∣ple; or, Lord, Let thine Enemies be scattered!</HI> how often is it called for? <HI>Elder</HI> persons may ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly Bless the <HI>Younger,</HI> with <HI>Ejaculations</HI> over them.

<P>A Christian has abundant <HI>Occasions</HI> for <HI>Eja∣culatory Thanksgivings</HI> too.

And every <HI>Dispensation</HI> of God, may be an <HI>Occasion</HI> of some <HI>Ejaculation</HI> to Him from us. The Primitive Believers, when they talk'd of their Sufferings, they did it with such an <HI>Ejaculation</HI> thereupon, as, <HI>Deo Gratias,</HI> or, <HI>The Lord be thanked!</HI> And shall not we then talk of our <HI>Enjoyments</HI> in such a Strain! When any conspicuous <HI>Mercy</HI> is bestowed upon us, then certainly we may discover our gratitude by some grateful <HI>Ejaculation</HI> immediately up∣on it, saying, <HI>Lord, Thou art Good, and thou dost Good!</HI> Yea, whenever any <HI>Attribute</HI> of God, is by an Effect, manifested unto us, we may by Some adapted <HI>Ejaculation</HI> celebrate

that <HI>Attribute.</HI> Straitways then direct such an <HI>Ejaculation,</HI> as, <HI>Lord, How great is thy Power, thy Wisdom, thy Justice, thy Soveraignty, and thy Bounty!</HI></P>
<P>And this is one Remarkable <HI>Expedient,</HI> whereby, whether we E<HI>at</HI> or <HI>Drink,</HI> or what∣ever we <HI>Do,</HI> we may <HI>Do all to the glory of God.</HI> We may string every distinct <HI>Action</HI> of our Lives, upon a Threed of <HI>Holiness,</HI> by such an <HI>Ejaculation</HI> over it, <HI>Lord, may this be done for thy Glory.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Meditation XXVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD>On Passing through the Fire.</HEAD>
<P><HI>SItting by the Fire,</HI> I call to mind frequent passages in the Divine Oracles about, <HI>Passing through the Fire:</HI> and I call to mind especially that prohibition, Lev. 18. 21. <HI>Thou shalt not let any of thy Seed pass thro' the Fire, to</HI> Moloch. It would now by the <HI>Fire side,</HI> be Edifying and Entertaining, to Enquire after the meaning of this matter.</P>
<P>And in the first place, we may Enquire, <HI>Who was Moloch?</HI> Now, I will not with <HI>Sel∣den,</HI> and <HI>Grot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us,</HI> and others, urge, that <HI>Moloch</HI> was the same with <HI>Saturn,</HI> the Daemon whom the <HI>Phoenicians</HI> chiefly served with their hor∣rible <HI>Technothysies.</HI> I will not with <HI>K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cher</HI> say, that <HI>Moloch</HI> was the same with <HI>Mars,</HI> tho' he might have a Coptical Commentary, where the Names of all the <HI>Planets</HI> being re∣cited in order, in the place of <HI>Mars</HI> there is
<PB N="153" REF="001067_0153_0FAEF4B2E4722F58"/>
<HI>Moloch.</HI> I will not say with <HI>Arias Montanus,</HI> That <HI>Moloch</HI> was the same with <HI>Mercury;</HI> though <HI>Malach</HI> do signify, what they made <HI>Mercury,</HI> a <HI>Messenger.</HI> Nor will I say with <HI>Cyril,</HI> that <HI>Venus</HI> was by the Ancients worship∣ped under the Name of <HI>Moloch;</HI> nor with <HI>Sanctius,</HI> that <HI>Moloch</HI> was an Idol peculiar to the <HI>Ammonites;</HI> nor with some others, That some certain <HI>King,</HI> by way of Eminency cal∣led so, (which <HI>Moloch</HI> signifies) tho' the par∣ticular Name of the Gentleman be now for∣gotten, were intended. I will rather <HI>concur</HI> with the Learned <HI>Spencer</HI> (however in the main Design for which he has Employ'd his Learning, I <HI>differ</HI> from him;) That <HI>Moloch</HI> was a Name common to all the Gods, (espe∣cially, <HI>The</HI> Sun) worshipped in the Images of the ancient Pagans. And therefore <HI>Baal,</HI> which was also a Name common for all False Gods, is promiscuously used for <HI>Moloch.</HI> [Com∣pare, Jer. 19. 5. with Jer. 32 35.] Indeed, there is extant at this day, an ancient Inscrip∣tion, which in the word, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, brings both Names into <HI>One. Moloch</HI> signifies a <HI>King,</HI> and it imports <HI>Government,</HI> and <HI>Maje∣sty:</HI> whereof, 'tis no wonder, if the <HI>Devil</HI> is ambitious. But it is also likely, that <HI>Malach,</HI> the root of his Name, signifies, to <HI>Worship,</HI> to <HI>Adore,</HI> to reckon as a <HI>God;</HI> for tho' the <HI>Lexi∣cons</HI> take no notice of such a sense, yet the E∣thiopic Language countenances it. Thus the
<PB N="154" REF="001067_0154_0FAEF4B390912278"/>
<HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>Hamath</HI> and <HI>Arphad,</HI> are called, <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Gods</HI> of <HI>Hamath</HI> and <HI>Arphad;</HI> [Isa 37. 13, with Isa 36. 19.] And <HI>Hercules,</HI> when called, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <HI>Melicertoe,</HI> by the <HI>Sidonians,</HI> was originally, <HI>Melech Kirtha,</HI> or, The Tutelar <HI>God of the City.</HI></P>
<P>But we will in the next place, Enquire, What was <HI>passing thro' the Fire to this Molech?</HI> Now, 'tis very certain, That some of the Pa∣gans, especially when certain Distresses were upon them, did use an <HI>Immolation</HI> of their Children unto <HI>Moloch.</HI> [Ponder, Ezek. 16 20, 21. with Jer. 7 31. and Jer. 32. 35. There I shall see the signification of <HI>Passing thro' the Fire.</HI>] As we read of the <HI>Sepharvites,</HI> [2 King. 17. 31.] That they <HI>Burnt their Children</HI> unto <HI>Adramelech,</HI> [or, <HI>Deus potens:</HI>] and <HI>Ana∣melech,</HI> [or <HI>Deus respondens.</HI>] Thus, other Hi∣storians, and particularly <HI>Josephus,</HI> relate such horrid practices to have been usual among the <HI>Canaanites;</HI> whom therefore the <HI>Book of Wisdom,</HI> calls, <HI>Unmerciful Murderers of their Children.</HI> The <HI>Ambiguity</HI> of the Diabolical Oracle requiring this Rite, may have been one thing that betray'd the woful people into it. As when <HI>Apollo</HI> demanded of the <HI>Pelasgians, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,</HI> which might signify, either, <HI>A man,</HI> or, <HI>A Torch:</HI> So very ambiguous was the phrase of, <HI>passing thro' the Fire.</HI> And therefore, the <HI>Hard Word,</HI> which the Elder Ages had under∣stood in the <HI>Harder Sense</HI> of <HI>Combustion,</HI> the
<PB N="155" REF="001067_0155_0FAEF4B446E3BF88"/>
Later Ages, found out a <HI>Softer Sense</HI> of <HI>Purga∣tion,</HI> for it; and they began to think, that <HI>Moloch</HI> would be content, as <HI>Tertullian</HI> speaks, <HI>Traducto Corpore</HI> F<HI>lamma.</HI> For this <HI>Februation</HI> of the Children to <HI>Moloch,</HI> two pyles were kindled, and persons were carried thro' them, in token of their consecration to <HI>Moloch.</HI> And thus tho' tis said of <HI>Ahaz,</HI> 2 King. 16. 3. <HI>He caused his Son to pass thro' the Fire;</HI> yet it seems, we find the Son surviving this <HI>Tra∣duction;</HI> it being that very <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ezekiah,</HI> who af∣terwards proved [<HI>O the Soveraign Grace of Heaven!</HI>] Such a notable Destroyer of these Idolatries. <HI>Theodoret</HI> is of this Opinion; who adds, <Q>I my self have seen it in some Cities, that once in a year they kindle <HI>Bonfires</HI> in the Streets, and not only <HI>Boyes,</HI> but <HI>Men,</HI> do Leap thro' those <HI>Fires,</HI> and <HI>Children</HI> are by their <HI>Mothers</HI> carried thro' them; and it ap∣peared a sort of <HI>Expiation.</HI></Q> Perhaps, this Remark by the way, might raise in ones mind, some Thoughts upon the Rites of <HI>Bon∣fires</HI> in our Days; especially, when we find them so condemned by the primitive Christi∣ans; and we find the <HI>Pagans</HI> confessing with <HI>Varro, Ignem magnum transiliunt, his pal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>libus se expiari credentes;</HI> and <HI>Ovid.</HI></P>

Children,</HI> was abominable unto God; so He forbad their <HI>Dragging of their Children through the Fire</HI> to <HI>Moloch;</HI> which they did, that they might not be obnoxious to the Strokes of any <HI>Doemon,</HI> or any <HI>Ill Eye,</HI> by their native Impurities, or to <HI>Dedicate them,</HI> and <HI>Initiate</HI> them unto the Service of the Idol; and express their Worship, first of the <HI>Fire,</HI> and then of the <HI>Sun,</HI> as a <HI>God.</HI></P>
<P>But could the Idolaters offer up their Chil∣dren to <HI>Moloch</HI> in the <HI>Fire?</HI> O my Lord Jesus Christ; If thou ever bestow <HI>Children</HI> upon me, I will offer them up unto thee, in a <HI>Flame</HI> of <HI>Love.</HI> They shall be thine; And, I pray, that thy <HI>Spirit,</HI> as a S<HI>pirit of Burning,</HI> may pu∣rify them for thy self.</P>

<HEAD>On the Sparks issuing from the Fire.</HEAD>
<P>BEholding the <HI>Sparks</HI> to ascend in such Number, and with such Briskness, from the <HI>Fire,</HI> what can I so readily think upon, as those words of <HI>Eliphaz,</HI> Job 5. 7. <HI>Man is born unto Trouble, as the Sparks fly upward!</HI> The first Thought, which at the first View, now natural∣ly rises like a <HI>Spark</HI> from the <HI>Fire,</HI> in the mind of a Devout Reader, would be This; That it is not more Natural for the <HI>Sons of the Burning Coal</HI> (as the <HI>Sparks</HI> are called here) to <HI>fly up∣ward,</HI>
<PB N="157" REF="001067_0157_0FAEF4B5D0331458"/>
than it is for the <HI>Sons of Sinful man</HI> to run into <HI>Trouble.</HI> It becomes me therefore to live to the continual Expectation of <HI>Troubles;</HI> yea, as many <HI>Sparks</HI> do arise together from the <HI>Fire,</HI> and these do no sooner disappear, but as many more <HI>Sparks</HI> do succeed, so I must Ex∣pect a Succession of <HI>Troubles:</HI> And it will not be unprofitable for me, to consider <HI>Sin,</HI> as the <HI>Fire</HI> at the Bottom, from which all these <HI>Trou∣bles</HI> are produced. We need not quote any Pagan <HI>Authority</HI> to prove, <HI>Natum in curas ho∣minum genus.</HI> General <HI>Experience</HI> gives us proof Enough.

Levity of <HI>Mans best Estate,</HI> in this World, that some (as <HI>De Dieu</HI>) thus read the Text before us; <HI>Man is born unto Trouble, and the very Sparks</HI> (not only the <HI>Fire,</HI> which, <HI>Levia Sursum secum r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pit,</HI> but even the <HI>Sparks</HI> themselves, are e∣nough to) <HI>carry him up.</HI></P>

<P>I call'd now to mind, that charge of God, Lev. 19. 17. <HI>Thou shalt not hat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e thy Brother in thy Heart; Thou shalt in any wise Rebuke thy

<HEAD>On Labouring in the Fire.</HEAD>
<P>SOmetimes I see a <HI>Writing,</HI> or some other curious, and perhaps tedious, Effect of <HI>Labour,</HI> thrown into the <HI>Fire;</HI> and then what becomes of all the <HI>Labour?</HI> This however shall come of it! It shall engage me in a short Me∣ditation, on those words of the Prophet, Hab. 2 13 <HI>Behold, is it not of the Lord of Hosts, that the people shall Labour in the very Fire, and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity?</HI></P>
<P>The Spirit of Prophecy here foretells the Downfal of <HI>Babylon:</HI> but it looks thorough &amp;
<PB N="163" REF="001067_0163_0FAEF4BD49DB9EE0"/>
beyond the Downfal of the Literal <HI>Babylon,</HI> down as far as that of the <HI>Mystical;</HI> the <HI>Town built with Blood,</HI> the <HI>City established by Iniquity,</HI> the Sorceress that <HI>makes the Neighbours Drunk,</HI> and <HI>Entices</HI> them into the <HI>Fornication</HI> of her <HI>I∣dolatries.</HI> The Oracle now before us, reports one special and signal character of the <HI>Time,</HI> when this Blessed Revolution is at the Door▪ And the general Importance of the Oracle, is, That an extraordinary, and an Astonishing <HI>Disappointment,</HI> shall attend the expectations of people in all their Affairs. The wrath of God, like a <HI>Fire,</HI> shall so devour the Effects of all their <HI>Labour,</HI> that when men have never so much <HI>wearied</HI> themselves, to bring about their purposes, they shall find nothing but <HI>Vanity</HI> frustrating all that they have purposed. Peo∣ple shall be strangely unprosperous in their most Hopeful, and most Likely Affairs, and have all their Hopes from very promising Ob∣jects evaporated into nothing.</P>
<P>Indeed, all the <HI>Labour</HI> wherein we do not Serve our Lord Jesus Christ, is <HI>Labour in the Fire:</HI> 'Tis but <HI>lost Labour</HI> all of it. But now even in my <HI>Labour</HI> for the Lord Jesus Christ, there are two Unhappinesses of <HI>Labour in the Fire,</HI> which I would very warmly deprecate.</P>
<P>First, I wish, that I may not <HI>Labour in the Fire,</HI> in regard of <HI>Unsuccessfulness</HI> attending my <HI>Labour,</HI> and so sad a Fate of the Souls under my Ministry, that they shall <HI>perish</HI> in the End∣less
<PB N="164" REF="001067_0164_0FAEF4BE17B722F0"/>
and Easeless <HI>Fire,</HI> of the Divine Indignati∣on, from whence the <HI>Smoke of the Torment as∣cends for ever and ever.</HI> Oh! Let not this be the upshot of all my <HI>Labour</HI> to Teach, and Charge, &amp; Warn the Souls under my Charge; that they shall be thrown into that <HI>Fire,</HI> where they shall cry out, with him, Luk. 16. 24. <HI>I am Tormented in this Flame!</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, I wish that I may not <HI>Labour in the Fire,</HI> in regard of the <HI>Unusefulness</HI> of the Things done by my <HI>Labour,</HI> and their being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it for nothing but the <HI>Fire</HI> We read, 1 Cor. 3 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>5. <HI>If any mans wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> shall be Burnt, he shall suffer loss; but he himself shall be saved yet so as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Fire Bel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>armine</HI> himself confesses, a <HI>Difficul∣ty,</HI> thro' an <HI>Al legory,</HI> in these words, tho' this <HI>Allegory</HI> is the main Foundation on which the Papists build such <HI>Hay and Stubble,</HI> as their Fig∣ment of <HI>Purgatory.</HI> The Apostle would have Pastors careful, how they Built up their Chur∣ches; whether with such <HI>Good Persons,</HI> &amp; such <HI>pure Doctrines,</HI> as would Endure the <HI>Fire</HI> of Tribulation and Persecution, and the <HI>Examen</HI> of the Holy Spirit of God.

<P>WE know, That <HI>Air</HI> is necessary to <HI>Flame.</HI> And our knowledge of it, is notably confirmed, by the Experiment of the <HI>Air <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ump,</HI> where <HI>Gunpowder</HI> it self, cast upon <HI>Hot Iron,</HI> will only <HI>melt</HI> and not <HI>flash</HI> in the Exhausted <HI>Receiver.</HI> And possibly to this may be owing the Experiment mentioned by my Lord <HI>Bacon,</HI> That if you hold an Arrow in the Flame for ten pulses, you shall find those parts of the Arrow which were on the <HI>Out side</HI> of the Flame far more burned and blacked, when that <HI>in the midst</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <HI>Flame,</HI> will be as if the <HI>Fire</HI> had hardly touched it. Yea, the Divine Oracles, [for such is the <HI>Fulness</HI> of them!] do seem to take notice of this Experiment, in Ezek. 15: 4 Where, first, <HI>Both Ends of the Vine stalk are devour'd and then the midst of it is burnt.</HI> But without those Experiments, we have e∣nough of it every day, when our <HI>Fire</HI> will not burn, because the <HI>Wood lies too close</HI> The <HI>Fire</HI> will be smothered and obstructed, if the <HI>Air</HI> have not Access unto it.</P>
<P>This thought invites me, in the first place,
<PB N="166" REF="001067_0166_0FAEF4BF88543F78"/>
to consider the Necessity of <HI>Air</HI> to <HI>Life</HI> in our selves: For, tho' I am not such a <HI>Psychopyrist</HI> as to call the <HI>Soul,</HI> a <HI>Fire,</HI> yet, I see not why <HI>Life</HI> may not be called so; and without <HI>Air,</HI> we see (howbeit there have been some rare Instances of persons that have <HI>Lived Breathless</HI> for many days together; it may be, <HI>Sal Ar∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oniack</HI> has revived the <HI>Flame;</HI>) that it will be soon extinguished. I would therefore give Thanks to the Good God, who by His <HI>Air</HI> does <HI>uphold my Soul in Life;</HI> and I would look upon it, as a very signal point of <HI>Health</HI> for me to be cautious, what <HI>Air</HI> I choose to be much conversant in; and not look to survive any long while, because none of my caution can secure me from the unseen <HI>Miasmata</HI> of the <HI>Air,</HI> which will damp all before them.</P>
<P>Dismissing of this Thought, I presently fall into another; Namely, That S<HI>mothered Griefs,</HI> are worse things than S<HI>mothered Fires,</HI> and not so likely to go out. If a man have any <HI>Griefs,</HI> or <HI>Fears,</HI> or <HI>Cares</HI> upon his mind, let them have <HI>Air,</HI> and they will the sooner evaporate. All will be the more <HI>Lightsome</HI> with us, if we don't let them L<HI>y too close</HI> upon our mind. He that has any Remarkable Guilt, lying with distress upon his Conscience, let him single out some <HI>Faithful Pastor,</HI> to whom what he confesses will be as it were but confessed unto the Lord. The <HI>Reveling</HI> of the matter, and his ensuing <HI>Prayers,</HI> and Counsils, and Cordials, will be of
<PB N="167" REF="001067_0167_0FAEF4C0A62384F0"/>
a blessed consequence unto <HI>an Heart that will be Hot, thro' a Fire burning in it, until it hath spoken with the Tongue.</HI> And let him that has any other Anguish, afford <HI>Vent</HI> and <HI>Air</HI> unto it, by some Agreeable Expressions of it: The <HI>Air</HI> will be a kindness to the <HI>Fire</HI> in the Soul; and all things will be the Better, and the Brighter for an Anguish not <HI>Lying too close</HI> upon it.</P>

the Statutes of God,</HI> as to give any real occasion for the Reproachful to <HI>pursue</HI> them, with their Calumnies. But leaving this Reflection, and finding the S<HI>moke</HI> to be very troubles me and vexations when it strikes into the Room, I call to mind those words of the Wise man, Prov. 10 26 <HI>As Smoke to the Eyes, so is the sluggard unto them that send him:</HI> that is to say, 'Tis a very great vexation. But then think I; L<HI>ord, How much mayst thou be offended at me, who am the worst Sluggard in the world, about the Errand upon which thou didst send me into the world! Thou hast sent me hither, to Glorifie thee, and to Testifie unto all the Truths and Wayes of thy Holy Religi∣on: But like a vile Sluggard, I have used shame∣ful Delayes about it.</HI> While I thus charge my self with such Wickedness, I behold in the <HI>Smoke,</HI> an Emblem of the Condition that is threatned unto the <HI>Wicked:</HI> For we read, <HI>As the Smoke is driven away, so shall they be;</HI> and, <HI>Into Smoke they shall consume away;</HI> yea, <HI>The Smoke of their Torment shall ascend for ever and ever.</HI> That I may be Saved, from this confu∣sion, which I have deserved, I de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire to repai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> unto the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of my Lord Jesus Christ; who in the Sufferings which he underwent for me, speaks of Himself, as, <HI>Dried in the Smoke.</HI></P>
<P>I remember a condition of much Affliction, is thus painted out. Isa. 14. 31; <HI>There shall come a Smoke.</HI> And when I see, the solid <HI>Wood</HI> on the F<HI>ire,</HI> evaporating into <HI>Smoke,</HI> which <HI>Mounts

<P>Methinks, in the <HI>Smoke</HI> I see likewise the picture of <HI>Pride:</HI> For it so bad, and ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and black a thing as the <HI>Smoke</HI> proceed from the brightest <HI>Fire,</HI> so does <HI>Pride</HI> from our brightest and bravest Excellencies: but when a man thro' his <HI>Pride</HI> is got unto the highest, all pre∣sently vanishes into Nothing Reader, Which is it, <HI>Smoke</HI> or <HI>Pride,</HI> that is intended in this Description? <HI>Sese Erigit, sed mox deficiens, quasi n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n fuerit, evanescit, et cum e rerum opulentia in∣tuneseat, in altum elata, quasi Exhalans, Evapo∣rata ac dispersa, in Nihilum convertitur.</HI></P>

<P>M<HI>Etals</HI> are not the only Things that are <HI>Tried</HI> by the <HI>Fire;</HI> All <HI>Bodies</HI> have their <HI>Trials</HI> in it: The <HI>Fire</HI> will discover the Na∣ture, the Texture, and the Temper of what is put into it.

<P>It becomes me, in the first place, to put my self as into the F<HI>ire,</HI> by a serious, frequent, ex∣act <HI>Self-Examination.</HI> It is very certain, That I am fully <HI>known</HI> unto that God, whose <HI>Eyes behold, and whose Eye lids try, the Children of men,</HI> and of whom it is an Assertion, perhaps more than seven times repeated in His Ora∣cles <HI>That He Tries the Hearts and the Reins.</HI> But it is of unspeakable consequence unto me, That <HI>I know my self;</HI> and that I may do so, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as much consequence, That I <HI>Try my self.</HI> To be very sollicitous, in <HI>Self Examination,</HI> would be both a <HI>Sign,</HI> and a <HI>Cause,</HI> of <HI>Sincerity.</HI> Hence, as when I have the Word of God

<P><Q>I feel none, like <HI>That</HI> of the S<HI>in</HI> remain∣ing in me, which indisposes me to <HI>Glorify</HI> my Lord Jesus Christ; and which Grieves His <HI>Holy Spirit.</HI></Q></P>

<P>But then, in the next place, I am to Re∣member, That the Blessed God, by the <HI>Afflict∣ion,</HI> which He sends upon me, does cast me into the <HI>Fire,</HI> to manifest what I am. <HI>Afflicti∣on</HI> is a <HI>Trial;</HI> Yea, I can find, where the Book which miscalls nothing, has called it, <HI>A Fiery Trial.</HI> And thus we read, 1 Pet. 1. 6, 7. <HI>Ye are in Heaviness, thro' many Temptations, that the Trial of your Faith, being much more precious than that of Gold which perisheth, tho' it be tried with fire, may be found unto praise</HI> A <HI>Sickness</HI> is a <HI>Fire,</HI> a <HI>Reproach</HI> is a <HI>Fire,</HI> a <HI>Loss</HI> is a <HI>Fire,</HI> (and the uneasiness thereby given to our Spi∣rit makes the comparison too sensible;) in which a <HI>Trial</HI> is made of us, whether we have the <HI>Spirit,</HI> not of <HI>Bastards,</HI> but of <HI>Children</HI> in
<PB N="180" REF="001067_0180_0FAEF4D0CF8B7A18"/>
us. Let this consideration mightily <HI>Enflame</HI> the zeal of my Soul, to be very watchful over my self, when I am in any <HI>Affliction.</HI> Let me now Remember, be the <HI>Affliction</HI> what it will, That the <HI>Heart searching</HI> Lord, is now <HI>Trying</HI> what is in my <HI>Heart;</HI> and let me therefore by Repentance, by Patience, by Humility, and Resignation, and by the Exercise of a Lively Faith, approve my <HI>Heart</HI> unto Him. Let it be my prayer and care, that under <HI>Affliction</HI> my conduct may be such, as that it may be said, <HI>Now I know, that thou Fearest God!</HI></P>
<P>But likening my <HI>Affliction</HI> to <HI>Fire,</HI> for its <HI>pro∣batory Vertue,</HI> I hope, I shall also find it like <HI>Fire,</HI> for its <HI>purifying Vertue. Ovid</HI> Sings, <HI>Om∣nia purga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>dax Ignis.</HI> And the F<HI>ire</HI> was, for its <HI>purifying vertue,</HI> used in the <HI>Lustrations</HI> of the Pagans. Now, If the <HI>Fire</HI> do consume the <HI>Filth</HI> of those things that are cast into it, and <HI>purge</HI> them, and <HI>cleanse</HI> them, <HI>Affliction</HI> will do so too: Tis a mighty <HI>purifyer:</HI> We read, Dan. 11. 35. <HI>It is to purge, and make white;</HI> we read, <HI>Isa.</HI> 27 9 <HI>By this Iniquity is purged.</HI> In∣deed, it is not in the power of <HI>Affliction</HI> it self to <HI>purify</HI> them that are in it: We see <HI>That,</HI> in a sad Experience. But the <HI>Grace</HI> of God, co-operating in and with an <HI>Affliction,</HI> will have this Effect upon His Chosen: [<HI>Lord, may it have so, upon my Defiled Soul!</HI>] To <HI>purify</HI> us from all <HI>Filthiness of Flesh and Spirit,</HI> and <HI>per∣fect our Holiness in the Fear of God.</HI> I wish
<PB N="181" REF="001067_0181_0FAEF4D188519F98"/>
that <HI>Affliction</HI> may serve only, to make me more <HI>pure in Heart,</HI> and more full of, and set for, <HI>Whatsoever things are pure.</HI> 'Tis a deplorable thing, to be cast into a F<HI>ire</HI> of <HI>Affliction,</HI> and not gain much <HI>Purity,</HI> and <HI>Sanctity,</HI> by being there. I would there∣fore lay it as a charge upon my self, That whatever <HI>Affliction</HI> befals me, I must seriously <HI>Consider,</HI> [<HI>In the Day of Adversity consider!] O my Soul, In what point of Holiness, must thou be more purified and advanced by means of this Affliction!</HI></P>
<P>But I will a little shift the comparison, and compare <HI>Grace</HI> if self unto the <HI>Fire.</HI> Without reading of <HI>Plutarch,</HI> who takes notice of that circumstance, it is noted by every body, That the <HI>Fire</HI> burns clearest and hottest, in the shar∣pest <HI>cold</HI> of the <HI>Winter. Adversity</HI> is a sort of a <HI>Winter;</HI> and the sharper the <HI>Winter</HI> of <HI>Ad∣versity</HI> may be upon me, I wish, That <HI>Grace</HI> may burn in me, with the more sensible and powerful Operation.</P>

<HEAD>On the Ashes.</HEAD>
<P>MY <HI>Hearth</HI> has now an heap of <HI>Ashes</HI> up∣on it. But can my <HI>Heart</HI> Read no∣thing there? Methinks, I can Read several Admonitions written in the <HI>Ashes,</HI> though no one has formed any distinct characters on

<P>Out of the <HI>Ashes,</HI> 'tis well known, we make the S<HI>oap</HI> wherewith our <HI>Cloaths</HI> are cleansed. On that passage in Luk. 14. 34, 35. <HI>The Salt is Good; but if the</HI> S<HI>alt have lost its savour, wherewith shall it be seasoned? It is neither fit for the Land, nor for the Dunghil, but men cast it out.</HI> I remember, Mon∣sieur <HI>Le Cler<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> thinks 'tis not <HI>Salt</HI> properly so called, that is there spoken of. He says, That <HI>Salt</HI> loses not its <HI>Savour;</HI> and that <HI>Salt</HI> which keeps its S<HI>avour</HI> is neither fit for the <HI>Land,</HI> nor for the <HI>Dunghill;</HI> and that if it keeps not its S<HI>avour,</HI> yet it is not <HI>cast out.</HI> He therefore supposes, That the Husbandmen call'd <HI>Ashes</HI> for <HI>Lye</HI> (which have the <HI>Salt</HI> of the <HI>Wood</HI> therein) by the Name of <HI>Salt.</HI> The <HI>Ashes</HI> 'tis very sure, lose their <HI>Savour,</HI> when they are diluted with <HI>Washing,</HI> and they did so, when of old they washed their <HI>Linnen</HI> in them. And being thus diluted, they are not fit either to manure the Ground alone, or mixed with <HI>Dung;</HI> for they have lost the S<HI>alt</HI> with which they were impregnated. Then indeed they are fit for nothing, but for to be <HI>cast</HI> out into the High way.

of that Gentleman are not always infallible. All I will say upon it, is this. Whether they wash'd their <HI>Cloaths</HI> with <HI>Ashes</HI> of old, or no, we'l see whether we can't wash our <HI>Hearts</HI> with 'em. They shall then do us more good, than a <HI>Washing with Nitre, and with much</HI> S<HI>oap.</HI></P>
<P>And first, <HI>I</HI> remember, the famous <HI>Querceta∣nus,</HI> together with other <HI>Labourers in the Fire,</HI> have told us, That they can take a <HI>plant</HI> in its more vigorous consistence, and after a due <HI>Maceration, Fermentation,</HI> and S<HI>eparation,</HI> Ex∣tract the S<HI>alt</HI> of that <HI>plant,</HI> which, as it were, in a <HI>Chaos,</HI> invisibly reserves the Form of the whole, with its vital principle; and that keep∣ing the S<HI>alt</HI> in a <HI>glass</HI> Hermetically Sealed, they can, by applying a S<HI>oft Fire</HI> to the <HI>glass,</HI> make the <HI>Vegetable</HI> rise by little and little out of its <HI>Ashes,</HI> to surprize the Spectators. I am not sure, That this Report is to be Relied upon, and much less am I sure, of what they further tell us, That the <HI>Essential</HI> S<HI>alt</HI> of <HI>Animals</HI> being thus prepared and preserved, an ingenious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> might raise the shape of them, at his pleasure.

<P>But now dismissing that Thought, the <HI>Ashes</HI> of my <HI>Fire,</HI> cause me to think, on the Terms wherein the <HI>Father of the Faithful</HI> addressed the God of Heaven, Gen. 18 27. <HI>Behold now I have taken upon me, to speak unto the Lord who am but Dust and Ashes.</HI> Well may Sinful man appear as <HI>Dust and Ashes,</HI> when he ap∣pears before that Infinite Majesty, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a <HI>Consuming Fire.</HI> The Holy God had <HI>not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> from <HI>Abraham,</HI> that He was going to Lay the Wicked Cities in <HI>Dust and Ashes,</HI> by F<HI>ire</HI> from
<PB N="185" REF="001067_0185_0FAEF4D486623F30"/>
Heaven. And now says <HI>Abraham, Lord, I de∣serve my self to be by Fire from Heaven, struck into Dust and Ashes!</HI> Truly, When I see the <HI>Ashes</HI> before me, I must confess, that I am worthy my self to be made <HI>Ashes</HI> immediately by the <HI>Fire</HI> of the Divine Indignation. <HI>Lord, If Sin can render any thing soon incinerable, I may wonder that I am yet any thing but a little Heap of Ashes.</HI> Yea, the best of men, when making their Prayers to God for the <HI>Worst of men,</HI> must confess, That the <HI>Fate</HI> and <HI>Fire</HI> of the <HI>worst of men,</HI> might justly be dispensed unto them.</P>
<P>Another thing observable to me in the <HI>Ashes,</HI> is, That tho' the <HI>Wood</HI> was of several sorts, <HI>di∣stinguishable</HI> one from another, yea, <HI>preferrible</HI> one to another, yet now they are all in <HI>Ashes,</HI> there is no sensible <HI>Distinction</HI> of them, they ly together <HI>undistinguished.</HI> Behold, O my Soul, Behold the Effect of <HI>Mortality.

<P>Indeed, I have Read concerning a <HI>Diffe∣rence</HI> in <HI>Dust;</HI> namely, the powder of <HI>Dia∣monds,</HI> or princely Dust: <HI>Gold Dust,</HI> or the Remains of Noblemen; <HI>Pin Dust,</HI> or the Re∣mains of Trades men; <HI>Saw Dust;</HI> or the Re∣mains of Mechanicks; and <HI>Common Dust,</HI> or the Remains of the more unobserved sort of people. Yet even here 'tis confest, All is <HI>Dust.</HI> But in <HI>Ashes</HI> there is not so much Dif∣ference to be discerned. All that we can al∣low, is, That our Lord Jesus Christ, at the <HI>Resurrection of the Just,</HI> will distinguish the <HI>Ashes</HI> of the Saints, which are United unto Himself, from those of other men; more Ef∣fectually, than a <HI>Load stone</HI> would any Filings of <HI>Steel,</HI> mixed with the common <HI>Ashes.</HI> Were I all this while seeking satisfaction, in Creatures, I should be doing what the Ora∣cles of God most expressively call, <HI>Feeding on Ashes.</HI> But while we are thu<HI>s Thinking on Ash∣es,</HI> and learning the Instructions of Piety from them, I hope we are not <HI>Feeding on Ashes.</HI></P>
<P>Nay, there is a notable <HI>Encouragement</HI> I now call to mind, afforded by the <HI>Ashes</HI> themselves, for that very Undertaking wherein we are now Engaged. But I will choose to recite it (which indeed may add unto the <HI>Encourage∣ment</HI>) in the words of the Excellent <HI>Boyl;</HI>

<P><Q>Tho' Grains of <HI>Sand</HI> and <HI>Ashes</HI> be but of a despicable smallness, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et the skilful Artificer brings Numbers of these, to afford him that noble Substance, Glass; by whose Help, we may see our selves, as in <HI>Looking Glasses,</HI> and discern Caelestial Objects, as with <HI>Tele∣scopes;</HI> and with the Sun beams kindle dispo∣sed Materials, as with <HI>Burning Glasses.</HI></Q></P>
<P>While we have been bringing of <HI>Lessons</HI> from the <HI>Ashes,</HI> we have been as good as ma∣king of <HI>Glasses</HI> from them, for all those Uses. My <HI>Ashes</HI> undergo an happy and useful <HI>Vitri∣fication,</HI> when they yield these <HI>Lessons</HI> unto us.</P>

<HEAD>On the Fire brands.</HEAD>
<P>REtiring to my Rest, I am very particular∣ly careful, That the <HI>Fire brands</HI> do no <HI>mischiefs.</HI> How carefully do I separate these F<HI>ire brands,</HI> and Lodge them in several places and postures, and perhaps cover some of them

<P>Of all the Things in the world, I do most heartily wish, <HI>That I may not be a Fire brand.</HI> Indeed, when the Grace of God saved me from the Errors and the Dangers of my Unregene∣rate State, it might be said of me, as of <HI>Jo∣shua,</HI> when saved from those of <HI>Babylon;</HI> Zech. 3 2. <HI>Is not this a Brand pluckt out of the</HI> F<HI>ire?</HI> And it is my Happiness to be such a <HI>Fire brand.</HI> But a <HI>Fire brand,</HI> is in our com∣mon Dialect, become a phrase for a <HI>Contentious</HI> man; one that bree<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <HI>Quarrels</HI> where he comes.

<HEAD>On the Fire's going out.</HEAD>
<P>THE Wood on my <HI>Fire,</HI> was in a mighty <HI>Blaze,</HI> that seemed as if it would have been a lasting one, at its first Blowing up: Nevertheless, the <HI>Bellows</HI> giving over to <HI>Blow,</HI> the <HI>Fire</HI> gave over to <HI>Burn</HI> immediately. Me∣thoughts, I now saw an Emblem of that <HI>A∣postasy,</HI> which often attends <HI>Good Beginnings</HI> in Religion, where the Grace of the Lord Jesus Christ (that Heavenly F<HI>ire</HI>) never took yet an <HI>Effectual Hold</HI> upon the Soul. Many <HI>Be∣ginners,</HI> in Religion, and <HI>Professors</HI> of it, seem very forward for the Services of Christianity, and make a mighty <HI>Blaze</HI> of Profession; but it is not a Lasting one: <HI>It goeth away.</HI> May the God of all Grace, make all our Young People, exceedingly apprehensive of, <HI>The</HI> A<HI>po∣states Doom,</HI> and afraid of <HI>Turning aside unto crooked wayes,</HI> thro' the Influences of <HI>Evil Com∣pany,</HI> or any other Temptation, after they have made <HI>Good Beginnings</HI> in Religion, lest they have that awful word fulfill'd upon them, <HI>If any man draw back, my</HI> S<HI>oul shall have no plea∣sure in him.</HI></P>
<P>Hereupon Resuming the <HI>Bellows</HI> for a <HI>Se∣cond
<PB N="191" REF="001067_0191_0FAEF4D90C9E0E88"/>
Blast,</HI> I Reserve and Revived the <HI>Fire,</HI> until it so arrested the <HI>Wood,</HI> as to carry all before it. And this put me in mind of an A∣stonishing Favour, which I had <HI>my self</HI> Re∣ceived from Heaven, and which <HI>many more</HI> of the Elect have likewise Received. It is very commonly so, That the <HI>Elect</HI> of God, which enjoy a Religious Education, have by the Spi∣rit of God excited in them, very <HI>Fervent</HI> In∣clinations to piety, while they are in their <HI>Childhood:</HI> But when they advance into more of <HI>Youth,</HI> Temptation so prevails upon them, that for a while, all seems to be <HI>Gone out,</HI> and their former Inclinations are hardly to be dis∣cerned: Nevertheless the Spirit of God will not let their <HI>Youth</HI> proceed very far, before He, who had been <HI>Grieved</HI> and <HI>Quenched</HI> by their Vanities, [L<HI>ord, can I write this, and not mingle my Tears with my Ink!</HI>] does again <HI>Bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w</HI> upon their Souls. A <HI>Fire</HI> is then Recovered, that shall never be extinguished!</P>
<P>Once indeed, Sitting by a F<HI>ire,</HI> where a <HI>Pot</HI> boiled over, I observed, That the <HI>Boiling</HI> over of the <HI>Pot</HI> put out the <HI>Fire,</HI> and left the <HI>Pot</HI> without likelihood of <HI>Boiling</HI> over any more: But therewithal I could not miss Re∣flecting, That there is a very wonderful Pro∣vidence of God, often doing a thing of this Importance. God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> permits the <HI>Fiery Lusts</HI> of men (whether of A<HI>nger,</HI> or of <HI>Am∣bition,</HI> or of <HI>Unchastity</HI>) to <HI>Boil</HI> over, in some
<PB N="192" REF="001067_0192_0FAEF4D9F1DC5FB0"/>
<HI>Scandalous</HI> Excesses, and Actions. But God improves this B<HI>oiling over</HI> of their <HI>Lusts,</HI> to mortify the <HI>Lusts</HI> themselves, and put out the <HI>Fires</HI> of Sin and Hell in their Souls. Many a mans <HI>Boiling over</HI> and Breaking forth into Scandals, proves the occasion of his being a more mortified man, even in those very points all the rest of his Dayes. <HI>Austins</HI> Exemplary Chastity was the fruit of his having once <HI>Boiled over.</HI></P>
<P>At last, While I was minding other matters, the F<HI>ire</HI> on my <HI>Hearth,</HI> was upon the point of Expiring, meerly because the <HI>Fuel</HI> was all spent, that should have supported it. I have been told, that <HI>Vulcan</HI> was of old feigned <HI>Lame</HI> for this reason; The <HI>Wood</HI> on the <HI>Fire,</HI> is the <HI>Staff</HI> which he is always calling for. I now Thought of several Things, that Need <HI>Recruits,</HI> if we would keep them from Expira∣tion; But I thought of one among the rest, which I wish'd might never be Recruited. Sinful <HI>Contention</HI> is a sort of a <HI>Fire;</HI> and it is said of a <HI>Contentious</HI> man, (which, L<HI>ord,</HI> Let me neither Be, or Bear!) <HI>He is an Ungodly man who diggeth up Evil and in his Lips there is, as a burning Fire</HI> And it is said, <HI>As Coals are to Bur∣ning Coals, so is a Contentious man to kindle Strife.</HI> Now 'tis among the Observations of Wisdom, in Prov. 26. 20, 21. <HI>Where no Wood is, there the Fire goeth out; So where there is no Tale bearer, the Strife ceaseth.</HI> Wherefore, as

<P>If a <HI>Quarrelsome Disposition</HI> be mischievous any where, tis in the <HI>Married Life,</HI> in the <HI>Conjugal-State.</HI> And upon the mention of This, I call to mind a Rabbinical Fancy: <HI>Isch</HI> signifies, <HI>A Man; Ischah</HI> signifies, <HI>A Woman;</HI> Hence they Note, In the Name of the <HI>Man,</HI> there is <HI>Jod,</HI> which is not in the Name of the <HI>Woman;</HI> In the Name of the <HI>Woman,</HI> is <HI>He,</HI> which is not in the Name of the <HI>Man:</HI> These two Letters make <HI>Jab,</HI> which is the Name of God; and these be∣ing taken away, there is nothing but <HI>Esch,</HI> in both Names; and that signifies <HI>Fire;</HI> This is to shew (they say) that as long as Man &amp; Wife agree, <HI>God is with them;</HI> when God is not with them, and when they disagree, there is nothing but <HI>Fire</HI> in the House.

<HEAD>On throwing my Pen into the Fire. Dec. 31. 1700.</HEAD>
<P>THus at length, in the <HI>Thirty Eighth</HI> year of my Age, I have Resumed and Finished the Reflections which I had begun, (and writ∣ten many of them,) and then thrown by, ma∣ny years ago. And having made an End of Writing my Reflections on the <HI>Fire,</HI> the old and worn <HI>Pen,</HI> with which I wrote the last of them, shall be thrown into the <HI>Fire.</HI> But before it goes, it shall enter for me a very Solemn <HI>Ad∣monition.</HI></P>
<P>There are <HI>Men,</HI> (as well as <HI>Pens,</HI>) who have written man, Good Things &amp; thereby done con∣siderable Service for the Churches of the Lord; but have been cast into the <HI>Fire</HI> after all: God has cast them into the <HI>Fire that never shall be Quenched.</HI> Many Learned, yea, many Devout, Writers have been <HI>Cast aways:</HI> because they have contented themselves with a meer <HI>Pen-and-Paper Piety:</HI> and going down to the <HI>Unquench∣able</HI> and <HI>Everlasting Fire</HI> have had cause to say, <HI>Surgunt ind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cti e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> rapiunt coelum; n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, cum <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Doctrina, mergimur in Infernum.</HI> Some writers have the Fancy to place their <HI>Pictures</HI> before the Title page of their Books; but they that write
<PB N="195" REF="001067_0195_0FAEF4DF8E88D728"/>
of <HI>Piety,</HI> should have their Books themselves to be their <HI>Pictures:</HI> They have no other way to prevent being thrown into the <HI>Fire.</HI></P>
<P>I do therefore, with an Humble and a Trem∣bling Supplication, beseech of thee, <HI>O my God, in my Lord Jesus Christ!</HI> That I may not only <HI>Write</HI> Good Things, but also <HI>Do</HI> what I <HI>Write,</HI> lest my <HI>Writings</HI> be made but the Fuel of the <HI>Fire</HI> that would be the just punishment of my <HI>Hypocrisy. Lord,</HI> Help me to <HI>Transcribe</HI> my Writings into my <HI>Life,</HI> lest I be all this while writing my own <HI>Condemnation to Death:</HI> and let thy Grace Help me not only to <HI>Write well,</HI> but also to <HI>Live well;</HI> that so instead of being thrown into the <HI>Fire,</HI> I may have a place in the <HI>Wings</HI> of the <HI>Heavenly Armies.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Upon a Stove.</HEAD>
<P>GOing out of my Study, to take some No∣tice of my <HI>Little Folks</HI> in a Room accom∣modated with that great convenience for a Fa∣mily of <HI>Little Folks,</HI> A Stove, I saw occasion to take another Pen in hand, for some Reflecti∣on. A <HI>Stove</HI> has no little Advantages of <HI>Cheap∣ness,</HI> &amp; <HI>Neatness</HI> &amp; <HI>Safety,</HI> and Uniform warmth, in any part of the Room, at any time of the year, for to <HI>Recommend</HI> it; nor is there any thing, that I know of, in the Objection of its
<PB N="196" REF="001067_0196_0FAEF4DFCC3DE170"/>
being <HI>Unwholesome</HI> (if it be not <HI>overheated,</HI>) for to <HI>Discommend</HI> it. But as my <HI>Stove</HI> has done me many another Service, it shall now Serve me with a Reflection, and Instruction of Christianity.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fire</HI> in my <HI>Stove</HI> does abundance of Ser∣vice, to all about it, yea, (as it is placed,) in two Rooms at once. My House is not now a <HI>Beth∣zenun,</HI> or <HI>place of Cold,</HI> (as the Jews called the Country that lay near the <HI>Snows</HI> of <HI>Lebanon:</HI>) but I have an <HI>April,</HI> or <HI>September</HI> there, in the midst of <HI>January:</HI> and yet the <HI>Fire</HI> which does all that Service, keeps out of <HI>Sight;</HI> no body <HI>Sees</HI> it; People <HI>feel</HI> the <HI>Effect,</HI> while they <HI>see</HI> not the <HI>Cause.</HI></P>
<P>Methinks, It advises me, to <HI>Do Good,</HI> and yet <HI>Ly Hid,</HI> as much as ever I can. There are cer∣tain points of <HI>Religion,</HI> wherein the <HI>Religion</HI> will be very much lost, if the circumstances of <HI>Se∣crecy</HI> &amp; <HI>Concealment,</HI> be not observed. Our Sa∣viour says, <HI>Let thine Alms be in Secret;</HI> &amp; again, <HI>Pray to thy Father in Secret;</HI> and once more, <HI>When thou Fastest appear not unto men to Fast</HI> An Affectation to have our doing such Duties di∣vulged, will be a <HI>Dead Flie,</HI> to spoil the Savour of the Duties, And very particularly, To give no <HI>Alms,</HI> but what shall be <HI>Seen,</HI> Savours of too much <HI>Hypocrisy.</HI> Tis true, That Good (<HI>quod fit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>videtu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI>) which is <HI>Seen</HI> to be <HI>done,</HI> is not al∣ways to blame; our <HI>Light</HI> should <HI>shine before men:</HI> But, (<HI>quod fit ut videatur</HI>) what is <HI>done</HI> to be <HI>Seen,</HI>
<PB N="197" REF="001067_0197_0FAEF4E091E3B640"/>
is indeed <HI>thrown away.</HI> The Hypocritical Jews, themselves, who laboured under an Invincible <HI>Itch,</HI> to have all their <HI>Alms</HI> as publick as they could, yet had their <HI>Conscience</HI> calling them, to more of <HI>Concealment.</HI> Hence, <HI>The Treasury of the Silent,</HI> where some good men, silently &amp; privately conveyed their Charity for maintaining the Children of the Poor, was a Treasury of the most famous Account in the Temple. And hence it was a Proverb among them, <HI>He that doth Alms in Secret, is greater than our master</HI> Mo∣ses <HI>himself.</HI> Briefly, An Humble Christian, will watch opportunities, to <HI>Do Good;</HI> but he cares not, whether there ever be in this world the least <HI>Notice</HI> taken of it. He will <HI>Pray</HI> for many and many a man by <HI>Name</HI> and yet the obliged man himself shall never know of it. He will convey <HI>Reliefs</HI> to the Needy, and yet the Needy themselves perhaps will never know from whence they came. He will a thousand other ways it may be, seek to be a Blessing unto his Neighbours, but never seek for them to <HI>Bless</HI> him, or know his Influences.</P>
<P>And now, to have done, Sirs, Let my <HI>Stove</HI> afford an Apology for my <HI>Nameless Writing.</HI> I am in hopes, That this little Book, may like a <HI>Stove,</HI> dispense a little <HI>Warmth</HI> of <HI>Religion</HI> unto them, that shall allow it near enough. <HI>Luther</HI> complain'd of the <HI>Religion</HI> in his Time, <HI>Deest Ignis, Deest Ignis!</HI> It wants more <HI>Heat!</HI> May not we make the same complaint of ours? It
<PB N="198" REF="001067_0198_0FAEF4E1648A08D0"/>
may be, this Essay, may Revive something of our Languishing <HI>Heat!</HI> We read Job 28. 5. Of, <HI>A Land,</HI> out of which <HI>cometh Bread; &amp; under it is turned up as it were Fire.</HI> (Perhaps, <HI>Paradise,</HI> with the <HI>Volcano's</HI> which vomited out <HI>Fire</HI> near it, may be referr'd unto!) I have been endea∣vouring a <HI>Book,</HI> out of which there may <HI>come Food,</HI> for the minds of the Faithful; and under it, <HI>all turns upon Fire.</HI> But I do for many Rea∣sons, now (as well as often heretofore,) choose to write <HI>Anonymously.</HI> And hereby, t'will come to pass, that tho' the Author will be unavoidably known unto many in the next Vicinity, (which also he could be glad, he were not!) yet he will be preserved from the knowledge of the <HI>most</HI> in places that are further off. The Author most sincerely wishes that with as much <HI>Useful∣ness</HI> (according to his mean capacity,) as may be, he may enjoy the Satisfaction of one, <HI>Bene qui latuit;</HI> and be as Remote from View, as the <HI>Fire</HI> in the <HI>Stove.</HI> If any <HI>Good</HI> be done, I be∣seech you, Sirs; Let <HI>Man</HI> be <HI>Nothing;</HI> Let GOD, and CHRIST, and GRACE, have all the <HI>Glory.</HI></P>

He says, That <HI>Red-hot stones</HI> were much improved in the <HI>Fires</HI> of the Ancients, to forward the various Designs upon which the <HI>Fires</HI> were kindled; and that there were such <HI>Red-hot stones</HI> upon the <HI>Altar,</HI> to help forward the Con∣sumption of the Sacrifices.</P>
<P>Perhaps our <HI>Meditations</HI> may lye like <HI>Red hot-Stones</HI> in the Readers <HI>Fire</HI> And now, to lay the <HI>Red-hot Stones</HI> together in an <HI>Heap,</HI> that the Reader may take out which of them he please, at any time, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Touch his own Heart withal. Behold, the <HI>Contents.</HI></P>
