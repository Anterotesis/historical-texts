first glance of their eye will be upon the Lord Jesus Christ when they see him yet afar off cloathed with such brightness and beauty: never did their eye behold such an object be∣fore: they admired to see the Saints, and to see themselves so transform'd, but how will they admire to see the Lord in such glory? if so be that some of his Disciples did gaze af∣ter him with wonder, when he was taken from them, and ascended into Heaven, <HI>Acts</HI> 1. 11. With what wonder will all his Disciples (most of which never saw him in the flesh, none of which saw him in such glory) then gaze upon him when he shall come down from Heaven? <HI>Ye men of G</HI>alilee, <HI>why stand ye gazing back into Heaven?</HI> say the Angels, <HI>this same</HI> J<HI>esus which is taken up from you into Heaven, shall so come in like manner, as ye have seen him go into Heaven;</HI> If you look and wonder now at his going, how will you look and won∣der at his coming▪ which will be as surely, but far more gloriously?

O how would they be overwhelmed with this sight, and utterly unable to bear it, if they were not strengthened beyond their present capacity! <HI>And is this the Saviour and Redeemer of the World? O glorious</HI> S<HI>on of Righteousness! did this most excellent person, who thus appears in the brightness of his Father, and is now come down from his glorious habitation, with such a glorious train of Angels, once vouchsafe to dwell with men, and vail his glory in the flesh? did this eternal son of God stoop so low as to take upon him our nature, yea to take upon him the form of a servant? did he live in such meaness and obscurity, and endure such hardship, contradicti∣on, reproach and injury, when he was upon the Earth? O infinite condescention! did this Lord of Life and glory in the days of his flesh so Weep and Pray, and cry: sweat and bleed, and dye, though with such pain, anguish and disgrace: yet with such willingness and patience in our steads▪ that he might redeem us from sin and death, and wrath to come: that we might not perish but have everlasting life?

Is this he who cloathed us when we were naked, even with the Robes of his own righteousness? that washed us when we were defiled, even in the fountain of his own blood? that cheared us when we were troubled, even with the comforts of his own spirit? that strengthened us when we were weak, even with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his might and glorious power in our inner-man? was i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from this Person that we received our Pardon, and Peace, our Supports our Graces▪ our Encouragements, and all the sweet re∣freshments we have found in Ordinances.</HI></P>
<P>Is this the advocate we made choice of, relied, and trust∣ed upon for life and salvation? Is this the master whom we followed, and whose work we were employed about?

<P>If so be that the Saints do now love Christ, whom they never saw, only have heard of, and believed the report of the World; how will they love him when they have this

sight of him, and see a thousand fold more beauty in him than was reported, or could be imagined? if so be that now sometimes they rejoyce, with glorious and unspeakable joy in believing, what will they do when they come to see him in his glory: if they can now rejoyce in tribulation, and take pleasure in the Cross and reproach of Christ, what will they find in their Masters joy, and the Crown which he now comes to put on their heads? O how glad will they be that they have been counted worthy to suffer any thing for such a Saviour▪ It will be a joyful time indeed unto the Saints when they are caught up in the Clouds to meet the Lord in the Air.</P>
<P>And the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oy of Christ will be no less, to meet with them; O with what an eye will he view them, when they are arising and descending with so much of his beauty and lustre upon them! none can conceive the love and delight which the Lord Jesus will take in them at that day: He will look upon them as those who were beloved by the Fa∣ther and himself from all eternity; as those who fetch him out of Heaven, before to Redeem them, and now to Glori∣fie them; he will look upon them as the travel of his soul; as the price of his blood; He will look upon them as the Jewels: as spoils taken out of the hands of his Enemies; he will look upon them as Plats grown up unto perfection; as servants who have done their work; as those who have kept up his honour in the World, he will look upon them as Members of his Body; he will look upon them as his dearest spouse and most beautiful Bride, who now cometh to be joyned to him more nearly, and to live with him for ever. O the love and joy of Christ at his meeting! if so be that Christ so dearly loved his spouse, and could delight in her too, when she was black and sooty, when her cloaths were spotted and stained, when her affections were weak, low and inconstant; how will he love and rejoyce in her when she is made perfectly like to himself, and so beautiful with his comliness? when her stains are all wa∣shed off, and she is presented before him without spot, or wrinkle, blemish, or any such thing: when she shall be

So much concerning the more im∣mediate Antecedents of the Judgment of the Righteous.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<P>THe second thing is to speak concerning the Judgment it self of the righteous. And there are two things the Scriptures speaks of, which Christ will do at his se∣cond appearance in the judgment of the righteous.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>He will take an account of them.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>He will pronounce the sentence upon them</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Christ will take an account of the righteous▪ <HI>Rom</HI> 4. 10, 12. <HI>We shall all stand before the Judgment</HI> S<HI>eat of Christ, and every one of us shall give an account of himself unto God;</HI> though the righteous shall not be brought to condemnation, yet they shall be brought into judgment, which will be for their Masters honour and their own: especially of those who can give a good account of the Tallents their Lord hath entrusted them withal.</P>
<P>I know it is a question among Divines, whether the sins of Gods people will be mentioned: and made manifest at the day of Judgment; I shall not determine the question, since the Scripture is not so plain; possibly the Lord having par∣doned them, covered, blotted them out of the Book of his remembrance, he will not mention them on that day; but sure I am, if they should be mentioned▪ it will not be to
<PB N="33" REF="039280_0036_1033C37A5F22A848"/>
their disgrace and grief, but to their more abundant joy in the Lord who hath forgiven them: If they should read their sins in the Book of Gods remembrance; they will find them like so many debts crossed out with the red lines of Christs blood: if the Devil should be permitted to accuse them at that time, who is now the Ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>user of the Brethren, and rip up their secret faults, the Lord himself will stand up and plead for them: he will make known the sufficient value of his Merits for their Ransome, and publickly acquit them from all guilt and condemnation: <HI>Who shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect it is God that justifieth: who is he that shall condemn? it is Christ that died for them,</HI> Rom: 8. 33, 34.</P>
<P>But these four things Christ will take an account of, in the judgment of the righteous.</P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>He will take an account of their Graces</HI> The vessels of the Virgins will be lookt into, what O I they have got, the hearts of the Saints will be lookt into, what graces they have obtained. Christ will then take notice what Godly sorrow they have had for sin, their secret weeping &amp; mourn∣ing, will then be made manifest; he will take notice what humility and meekness, what self-denial and patience they have had, especially what faith, and love, and hope, and spiritual joy they have had, and all their raised affections to∣ward<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> himself, and Heavenly things, in his Ordinances, and his judgment of grace will not be according to the ap∣pearance and shew which hath been, but according to truth: and then the Saints shall be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ancked, not according to their esteem and dignity in the World, but according to the mea∣sure of the graces they have attained.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Christ will take an account of the improvement of the ta∣lents of graces and gifts, and opportunities of service which he hath intrusted them with all, Mat</HI> 25. 19. And Christ will then take chief notice of those which have been most indu∣strious and faithful, and instrumental for doing most good, and bringing most glory to his Name, and though all shall have a full reward that are found truly faithful, and shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ter into their Masters Joy; yet they shall have a more full
<PB N="34" REF="039280_0037_1033C37C1C7821B8"/>
reward, and be capable of more joy and glory than the o∣ther.</P>
<P N="3">3. And especially, <HI>He will take an account of their works of Mercy, Mat.</HI> 25. 35, 36. <HI>I was hungry, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink:</HI> I <HI>was a stranger, &amp; ye took me in: naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye vi∣sited me, I was in Prison, and ye came unto me,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>It will even astonish and confound the righteous to hear such language as this from the Lord Jesus Christ: when he appears in such glory, they will be ready to question, when he was in any want, and received relief at their hands: <HI>When saw we thee an hungry, or a thirst, or naked, and ministred any help.</HI> We received all from thee, but we could give no∣thing to thee: thou didst relieve us, and redeem us out of the deepest poverty and misery in which we were sunk, and should have perished without thy help: but what relief hadst thou from us; <HI>Then the King will answer and say unto them, v.</HI> 40. <HI>Verily I say unto you, in as much as ye have done it</HI> to <HI>one of the least of these my Brethren, ye have done it unto me.</HI> At such a time and such a time, the poor came to you for relief making use of my name, whose backs for my sake ye cloathed, and whose bellies you refreshed, and whose ne∣cessities you supplied, that was done unto me; though they were poor, they were my brethren: some of my servants were brought into straights for Conscience sake, and you re∣ceived them, or sent help to them: you received me then, and gave help to me, and I am come to give you a thou∣sand sold reward. Were this truth more effectually believ∣ed, what a forwardness would there be in Christians to works of mercy: surely they would look upon that part of their estate as best improved: which in such works is be∣stowed. Christ doth not mention any other use which they put their mony unto, which if worthy to be compared, would be made mentioned of▪ he doth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> speak of so much laid out in building, so much laid out in cloathing, so much laid out for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so much laid up in portions for Chil∣dren: all this the wicked can do: but so much laid out to the poor, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in them, which is the only part ye have
<PB N="35" REF="039280_0038_1033C36A3A32F0E8"/>
laid up for your selves: and which I am now come to re∣turn you with usury.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Christ will take an account of the afflictions which the righ∣teous have endured:</HI> especially, of their sufferings for his sake: such reproaches, such losses, imprisonments, banish∣ments▪ buffetings: but if they have suffered death, with what honour will this be made mention of? with what great e∣steem will he receive and speak unto them which have come out of great tribulation▪ and O the Joy in this morning, after the tears of the night▪ then they will find that their <HI>light affliction which they have endured for a moment, hath wrought for them a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor:</HI> 4. 17,</P>
<P N="2">2. The second thing in Christs judgment of the Saints, is the Sentence which he will pronounce upon them, which will be a most glorious Invitation of them to take possession of the Kingdom of Heaven which he hath prepared for them. <HI>Mat</HI> 25. 34. <HI>Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand▪ Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the World.</HI></P>
<P>All Christs invitations in Scripture are very sweet, <HI>Come unto me all ye that labour▪ and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest, Mat.</HI> 11. 28. How sweet is this to a troubled Consci∣ence, and an oppressed spirit, ready to sink under the bur∣then of sin? <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> every one that thirsteth, come to the waters: and be that hath no mony, come buy wine and milk without mo∣ney, and without price, Isa.</HI> 55. 1. O what sweet words are these to those which are parched, and pained, and ready to dye with spiritual thirst, and can find nothing in the crea∣tures which can give them any satisfaction or ease? But of all the words that ever Christ did speak, of all the invitations that ever Christ did make, this will be the sweetest, which he will give to his Disciples at the last day, <HI>Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you, from the foun∣dation of the World. Come ye blessed and happy ones,</HI> however accounted miserable ones by men, yet blessed of my Fa∣ther, <HI>Come inherit the Kingdom prepared for you, from the foun∣dation of the World.</HI> Take possession of your eternal inhe∣ritance:
<PB N="36" REF="039280_0039_1033C37DD2575BB8"/>
Come enter into the Kingdom of Glory, which the Father hath chosen you unto, and called you unto, and which I have purchased, and now fitted and made ready for you: Come along with me, and <HI>I</HI> will shew you my glory: and where I am, there ye shall be also. Come along, with me into Heaven, and ye shall live and reign with me for ever and ever. Come along, and enter now into your Ma∣sters joy: come and <HI>I</HI> will shew you the Father, and bring you into his House and presence, where there is fulness of joy, and pleasures for evermore. And now Beloved, think with your selves, what joyes! what exhaltation! what clap∣ping of hands! what shoutings! what Hallelujahs! what Hosannahs! what triumphing acclamations the Saints will make upon the hearing of these words <HI>B</HI>ut here words fail, conceptions fall short, Who can utter what the affe∣ctions and behaviour of the righteous will be, when they have their sentence, and hear such sweet and gracious words from the mouth of their Judge and Redeemer.</P>

<P N="1">1. <HI>The immediate antecedents of the Judgment of the wicked will be,</HI></P>

are <HI>clapt up in the Prison of the Grave,</HI> where they rot and putrifie under the chains of death, which are laid upon them, and their souls are <HI>shut down into the Prison of Hell,</HI> where they are bound in chains of darkness, and wo, and reserved unto the judgment of the great day; when the Lord Jesus shall appear to judge the World, he will bring the keys of Death and Hell along with him, and open both these Prison doors, not to give liberty and release to the Prisoners, but as Prisons are opened at assizes, to bring them forth to Judgment; he will open the Prison of Hell, and all the souls of the wicked shall come forth like so ma∣ny <HI>L</HI>ocusts out of the bottomless Pit: and he will open the Prison of the Grave, and all their bodies shall creep like so many ugly Toads out of the Earth: and then soul and bo∣dy shall be joyned together again, and this meeting will be sad, beyond expression: the meeting of the souls and bodies of the righteous will not be more joyful, than the meeting of the souls and bodies of the wicked will be doleful: possi∣bly some of the wicked had no hands in their death, and their souls went forth of their bodies without much pain or fear; but their entrance▪ into their bodies again, will be with un∣expressible horrour: and if some of the wicked had their Consciences awakened at death, and they lay down with tor∣rour: when they awake and rise again from the dead, it will be far greater terrour. The old World dyed in a fright with the Deluge of water, which overwhelmed them, <HI>Corah, Dathan,</HI> and <HI>Abiram,</HI> with their Company, died in a fright, at the cleaving and opening of the Earths mouth, which swallowed them up: <HI>Judas</HI> and other despairing souls died in a fright, at the apprehensions of the open mouth of Hell, ready to receive their guilty spirits: but none of the wicked could go forth of their bodies in such a fright as they will enter into them again at the last day: The damned souls have been lying in Hell many years, full of anguish in their separation, and they know that their anguish will be increa∣sed by the torment of their bodies in their union: and no wonder if they be exceedingly unwilling and fearful to en∣ter into their old lodging: their bodies have been sleeping

all this while in the Dust, and have felt no pam at all: and O how unwelcome a guest will their Souls then be: Never was Death so terrible unto them, as <HI>L</HI>ife will be at that day: they had rather sleep still in their Grave, and continue in their rottenness and corruption: they had rather lie hid for ever in the dust of oblivion, or be quite annihilated like Beasts, than to rise again unto such torments: as now they must undergo: but they must arise, willing or unwilling: It is said that the <HI>vile bodies</HI> of the righteous <HI>shall at the last day be fashioned like unto Christs glorious body, Phil.</HI> 3. 21. They shall be made like unto Christs body in beauty and glory: but the bodies of the wicked will have another hue and fashion: i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it were possible to fashion bodies like Devils, those impure and foul spirits, such spiritual bodies the wicked should have: be sure their bodies shall have no glory put upon them: but they lay down vile bodies, they shall rise up more vile: they lay down in dishonour, and they shall be raised in far greater dishonour: indeed they will be raised incorruptible and Immortal: but this will not be for their glory, but that they may be capable of the greater and longer torment and misery: their bodies will be so far from being made beau∣tiful like unto Christs, that I believe they will not regain that natural beauty which they had here upon the Earth: now some of them out-shine Gods own Children (whose chief beauty lies inward) in external comliness: then none but the Bodies of Gods Children will shine: And then the bodies of the wicked most probable will be swarthy, black, ugly monstrous bodies: if there be a ghastliness upon the bodies of the most beautiful, when they are dead, what ghastliness will there be upon the bodies of all the wicked, when the second death shall seize upon them? were their bodies never so beautiful in themselves, yet their features would quickly be altered by the horrible passions of their mind: the blackness and dread of the soul would quickly appear in their countenance: besides the im∣pressions which the Fire of Hell will have upon them.

of its anguish: it will return into the Body as in a Prison or Dungeon, where there is no pleasure to be found, and if the body be black, how black will the soul be, after so long aboad with foul Devils in the lower Region of dark∣ness? And when such soul souls and such vile bodies meet What a meeting! What a greeting will there be! We may fancy a kind of language to be between them, at that day. The soul to the body, <HI>come out of thy hole thou filthy dunghil flesh, for the pampering and pleasing of whom,</HI> I <HI>have lost my self for ever: who hast stoln away my time, and thoughts, and heart from God and Christ, and Heavenly things, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eed, and cloath, and cherish thee, and make provisions to satisfie thy base deceitful lusts: when I should have been making provision for thine and mine everlasting happiness.

2. <HI>The second Antecedent to the judgment of the wicked, will be their meeting with Devils:</HI> the righteous will meet with Angels to welcome them out of their Graves; the wicked will meet with Devils to entertain them at their resurrecti∣on: and then they will not appear to them, like Angels of light, as sometimes here they have done; but like foul An∣gels of darkness, as they ever were since their first fall: they will not then entertain the wicked with pleasing baits, and sweet alluring temptations, and pretend to be their friends, who consult their good and satisfaction, beyond God him∣self, the chief good of mankind; as they did when their a∣bode was in the world before: but they will spit forth their venome, and malice, then, in their faces; possibly they may buffet their bodies, and lay painful strokes upon them; surely they will terrify their soules for those sins which they have drawn them unto the commission of; O how will they mock, and deride their folly, and madness for opening their eares to their whispers, for opening their heart so freely, when they have knockt at the door, and entised them unto sin? then the damned will perceive that the Devils design was their ruine and misery, when the pretence and show was consultation for their good and happiness; that he laboured to please and delight them, not out of love, but malice, that he might undoe them: that he lul'd them asleep, that they might not perceive their misery, till it was too late; that poyson was in his sweetest baits; and that their softest plea∣sures were Sathans silken cord<HI>s,</HI> by which he was drawing them unto endless wo and bitterness: then they will per∣ceive how the Prince of Darkness hath blinded their eyes, &amp; deluded them; how the old Serpent hath beguiled them through his subtilty, and deceived them▪ how they have been gull'd of a Crown and Kingdome they had the proffers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and were in a capacity to obtain: then they will per∣ceive whose slaves they have been, whilst they were serving divers lusts: that the Devil was their Lord and Master, and led them captive at his will; and now they will meet with

<P N="1">1. <HI>The Scriptures have clearly revealed and foretold Christs second appearance to Judgment.</HI> It is not a truth written in the Book of nature, it is not to be found in the writings of the Philosophers, and those who have had the highest speculations of natural causes, and effects, and products; this is a mysterie which the world by wisdom could never find out; it is a secret which hath been hid in God, and is revealed by his Spirit in his Word: this coming of Christ was foretold by <HI>Enoch Jude</HI> 14,15. <HI>And Enoch also the seventh from Adam prophesied, Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousand of his Saints, to execute judgement upon all, &amp;c.</HI> So that it is of ancient, revelation.

However God hath put characters of himself in the Book of, the Creatures to be read of all, making known by his Works his eternal Beeing, his infinite Power, Wisdom and Goodness; yet most of the wisest Men, who have lived in the Heathen World, and have been the greatest Students of the Book of the Creatures, and have had no view of the Book of the Scriptures, have been so gross in their conceptions of God, that as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣postle said, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1,22,23. <HI>When they professed themselves to be wise, they became fools; and changed the Glory of the incor∣ruptible God, into an Image made like to corruptible Man, and to Birds, and four footed Beasts, and creeping things;</HI> They have figured to themselves and worshipped many Gods, unto the dishonour of the true God: And if some of them have arrived by the light of nature, unto the notion of one God; yet their conceptions of him have been low, mean, and unworthy of him: and in no Book in the World is God set forth so fully and highly in his glorious attributes, and superlative excellencies, as he hath set forth himself in the Book of the Scriptures. We may finde in heathen Writers high Elogi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m's and Panegyricks of some men and Women, famous in their time, for their valour, and so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> moral vertues, whom they have deified in after ages, and given room amongst their feigned Gods and Goddesses, de∣dicating Temples, and giving worship unto them: but in no Heathen writings shall we finde the praises of the true God, and rules given for the service and worship of him a∣lone, as we shall finde in the Scriptures. Large Volumes some Heathens have left behind them, the design of which hath been their own glory, and (as much as in them lay) the eternizing their Fame, which is an evidence that themselves were Authors of them; because we cannot rationally think
<PB N="140" REF="039280_0143_1033B2AB35108C88"/>
that any motive should induce others to make, and put forth Books in their names, that they might obtain glory for them unto whom it did not belong: so this little volume of the Scriptures, designing the glory of God, and the promo∣ting of his Interest in the hearts of Men, and the Pen-men employed in the writing thereof, not in the least pretending, that what they wrote, was the invention of their own brain, doth evidence God himself to be the Author of this Book. Wherefore the Scriptures being so clear in their discoveries of the one true God, and setting him forth more gloriously than any other Book, and ascribing all praise and honour to him, and appointing all religious worship to be given to him only, and designing his glory throughout the whole, doth evince that the Scriptures are indeed the Word of God.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The second Character of Divinity in the Scriptures is, the sublime mysteries therein revealed;</HI> namely concerning the Trinity of Persons in one nature and essence of God; the hypostatical union of the two natures of God and Man in one person of Christ; the mystical union of Christ and his mem∣bers, and the like; which mysteries are so sublime, so high, that no mortal Man of the highest reason, and most elevated understanding could possibly invent, in as much as now they are revealed, they exceed the capacity of the most en∣lightned to understand: especially if we further consider by whom these mysteries were revealed; not by the great Schollars, and subtle Philosophers of the World; not by them who were brought up in Schools, and had conversed with Books and learned Men; not by Men of high parts, who had polished their reason, and heightned their under∣standings by all possible humane helps; but the most of the Pen-men of Scripture, especially those by whom the greatest mysteries are revealed, were Fisher-men, Publicans, and the like; Men of mean education, illiterate Men; Men of no reading, and of but m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an natural abilities; as appears not only by the history, but also by the stile of their writings; which hath not that politeness as is to be found in many humane Authors; which doth not run in such a golden stream of eloquence, neither is dressed wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h▪
<PB N="141" REF="039280_0144_1033B2A9B2872E40"/>
such nea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nesses of Wit, nor garnished with such flowers of Rhetorick; which is not methodized by the rules of Lo∣gick, nor enterl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rded with any peepings of humane wis∣dome; which doth not favour of high parts, and great na∣tural ingenuity, or give the least suspicion of cunning, and subtilty, which these Men had above others; But some of highest mysteries of divinity are set forth by these Pen-men in a passing-mean and home-spun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dress; yea they are left even naked and bare of such apparel, as the ingenuous Men of the World have cloathed their matter withall, which hath given the light of the most glorious truths and mysteries more evident discovery▪ not but that some parts of the Scriptures have such a strain of divine eloquence, as doth exdeed humane writings; but the plainness of the stile, especially of the Apostle <HI>John</HI> in his Gospel, and <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thew,</HI> &amp;c. Doth evince that what they delivered was not their own invention, but that they were acted by another spirit in the writing of them, even by the Spirit of God, who did re∣veal all the mysteries, which they speak of in whole, unto them.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>A third Character of Divinity in the Scriptures is the wisdome which there doth appear, especially the wonderful cor∣ty<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vement of God's wisdome in Mans redemption and salvation by Jesus Christ, which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there made known;</HI> No Book in the World doth shine with such beames of wisdome, as the Word doth; it doth teach Men wisdom, spiritual and divine wisdom, in comparison with which all the wisdome of the World is but foolishness; It doth irradiate the minde with the most glorious light, and proposet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> to the understanding the most noble objects; it discovers the greatest truths of the greatest concernment; it she we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h the way to avoid the most dreadful effects which sin will produce, and to obtain the highest happiness which humane nature is capable of; which is one part of its divine stamp. Moreover the Scriptures do set forth the infinite wisdome of God, in the wonderful Contrivement of the Salvation of fallen Man by his only Son the Lord Jesus Christ, the only Saviour of Man-kind, which wisdome
<PB N="142" REF="039280_0145_1033B2A7D18D8F90"/>
being so transcendent, doth evidence both the Contrive∣ment thereof in Mans salvation, and the discovery thereof in the Scriptures to be from himself: so that as by the light of the Word we may know what this wisdome was, even so by this wisdome we may know the Word to be the Word of God.</P>
<P>To clear this Argument, I shall show, 1. That the way of Mans salvation by Jesus Christ, which the Scriptures re∣veal, must needs be the contrivement of Gods wisdome. 2. That the revelation of this contrivement must, needs be from God, which I suppose will be an evident demonstra∣tion of the Divine Authority of the Scriptures.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That the way of Mans Salvation by Jesus Christ was the contrivement of Gods wisdome,</HI> will appear, because it was impossible for any Man of the most searching brain, and most notable invention to have imagined it. Man being guilty of sin against the Law of God, inscribed upon the hearts of all Men, which natural Conscience will accuse of, if sinners listen thereunto; and Gods Justice being engag∣ed to inflict a punishment proportionable unto the crime without a satisfaction, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight reason will say is but reasonable; and this Justice of God being infinite; must in reason require an infinite satisfaction; Now what created understanding could of it self have contrived or conceived, a way how this should be done? Every thing that hath a being, is either God or a Creature; all the Creatures are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nice in their Beeings and Actions, and therefore could not make an infinite satisfaction; It is God only who is infinite, and he being the party offended could not make satisfaction to his own justice, especially since his justice requires pun∣ishment for satisfaction, which God as God, being impas∣sible, is uncapable of; not to say any thing that the same nature which did commit sin should in justice suffer the punishment; would not reason now conclude, that it were impossible for this satisfaction to be made? Surely it was none but the wisdom of God that could contrive the way of satisfaction to his justice, by the incarnation of his Son, by the union of the divine nature in the second Person of
<PB N="143" REF="039280_0146_1033B2A61E8677E8"/>
the Trinity, unto the humane nature in the Person of Christ that so by vertue of the hypostatical union, the humane nature might not only be strength<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to undergo the wrath of God, which was due for the sins of Men, in the suffer∣ings which he endured before, and upon the Cross; but also that through the communication of attributes, the sufferings of Christ might be of infinite value, because the sufferings of such a Person as was God, as well as Man, that so they might be a full satisfaction unto Gods justice for sin; and through Gods Covenant, with him, and gra∣cious acceptation of this satisfaction from the surety, instead of the offenders themselves, the sins of Men might be par∣doned and their souls saved. <HI>O the depth of the Wisdom of God!</HI> here is the wisdom of God in a <HI>mystery!</HI> surely they are blinded and hoodwinked by the Devil who do not acknowledge that this was the con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rivement of Gods wisdom.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Revelation of this Contrivement of wisdom, was from God:</HI> will appear in that none could know the mind of the Lord herein, unless he himself had discovered it; <HI>What Man,</HI> said the Apostle, <HI>knoweth the things of Man, but the spirit of Man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no Man but the spirit of God.</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2. 11. And <HI>the spirit of God searcheth all things, even the deep things of God;</HI> and unless the spirit had revealed these things, we must have remained in our ignorance of them, since it could not have entered into our hearts to have conceived them: seeing then none could have discovered the deep contrivements of Gods wisdom, unless God by his spirit had revealed them, and seeing these contrivements are revealed in no other Book, but the Book of the Scriptures, it is evident that the Scrip∣tures must needs be the Word of God: which also will further appear, if we consider the manner of the Revelati∣on of the mystery of Mans redemption and salvation by Je∣sus Christ, that it was revealed by pieces, and more ob∣scurely at first; and that divers Men were made use of in the discovery thereof in divers ages, who spake hereof most∣ly in dark sayings; and where they spake most clearly, yet
<PB N="144" REF="039280_0147_1033B2A46BE06FE8"/>
themselves had not a clear understanging of what they were moved to speak by the Holy Ghost; but searched what, and what manner of time the Holy Ghost which was in them did signify, when it testified of the sufferings of Christ, &amp; the design of them; whence it is evident that they were not, neither could be the Contrivers of what they revealed, but that the Revelation was from the spirit of God, which did inspire the Prophets, and was the same in all the Pen-men of the holy Scriptures, whom Men of insight in the Scrip∣tures may plainly perceive to be guided and acted by the same spirit in their Revelation of the contriv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ment and way of Mans salvation by Jesus Christ.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>A Fourth Character of Divinity in the Scriptures is the Furity and Holiness of them;</HI> the Scriptures, are like Silver of Gold purified, and seven times tried in the Fire, where∣in no dross doth remain, <HI>Psal.</HI> 12. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Scriptures are pure and holy, from the beginning of them to the end: In do Histories shall we find such examples of holiness, as the Scriptures do record; in no Writings of moral Philoso∣phers, shall we find such precepts of holiness, as in the Scriptures are enjoyned: Indeed, the light of nature hath been improved by some Heathens so far, that they have given excellent rules for the restraining of vice, and ob∣taining of moral vertues, and the ordering their conversa∣tions in such a vertuous way, that those persons, who have observed these rules, have been illustrious in their gene∣rations, and have shined with some kind of brightness in the dark places where they have lived; but in no Book that ever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssued from the brain of man shall we find such exact rules for holy living as in the Book of the Scriptures: In this Book we find the moral Law summarily, comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣hended in the Ten Commandements, which was written by God himself on the Tables of Stone, when <HI>Moses</HI> was with, him in the Mount; in which there are such holy pre∣cepts, as no Heathen Author can show the like; the Hea∣thens were blind, as to the duties of the first Table of the Law, which have a reference unto God, and in obser∣vance of which, man holiness doth chiefly consist; in the
<PB N="145" REF="039280_0148_1033B2A2E748D2E0"/>
second Table duties they had some understanding, yet they were much mistaken is some things, accounting some sin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s ambition, self-murder in some cases, and the like, to be vertues; and they had not so deep an insight into sin, they did not apprehend the inclination of the heart, and the pre∣vious motions to the consent of the will to evil, (which the Scriptures do discover) to be sinful and offensive in the eyes of a pure and holy God.</P>
<P><HI>Moreover, in the Scriptures we find the holy precepts of the Gospel, which the Heathens were strangers, unto; and a way dis∣covered not only for the obtaining the pardon of for, but also for the subduing and mortifying of sin: where means are made a known, not only for the restraining of a vicious nature, but also for the changing of it, for the regenerating of the soul of man, and form∣ing it after the Image of the holy God, in knowledge, righteous∣ness, and ture holiness, the making men partakers of the di∣vine nature, which Heathens never understood the meaning of; the Scriptures show the way of obtaining the sanctifying graces of Gods Spirit; which do further exceed the morall virtues of the Heathen in lustre, than the Sun doth exceed the lesser Stars in brightness and glory.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Marvellous is the purity and holiness of the word, such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> doth not savour of any thing terrene and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; yea, it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> such as is directly opposite to the natural b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ss of the hearts of all men and woman in the world, whilst they are in a state of nature; such as doth contradict carnal affections, and against which the carnal mind hath a natural enmity; and unto which all such and none but such have a liking and love, as are re∣generated by the Spirit of God; whence it strongly follows, that the Scriptures could not proceed from men, but that this holy Book did proceed from the immediate inspiration of the holy Ghost, in those holy men which were the Pen men thereof.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It will appear that the Scriptures are the word of God from the marvellous power and efficacy of them.</HI> Such a pow∣er and Spirit hath and doth accompany the preaching <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Gospel, which in the Scriptures is contained, as do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="146" REF="039280_0149_1033B2A12FA5C100"/>
evidence them to be from God alone: we read 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 12. of them which preached the Gospel with the holy Ghost sent down from Heaven. This hath been, this is unto this day.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The wonderful power of the Gospel in the first preaching of it, doth evince that it was from God, when so great a part of the world was in so short a time subdued unto the obedience thereof; when the Gospel prevailed not only amongst many of the Jews after Christ Ascension, and the effusion of the holy Ghost more largely upon the Apostles, so that three thousand people were converted to the faith by one Sermon of the Apostle Peter. Acts</HI> 2. 41. <HI>and five thousand more, Act.</HI> 4. 4. <HI>but especially, in that it prevailed amongst the Gentiles and Heathens, and so many Churches of Christ were planted and brought, not by carnal weapons but by Spiritual, to the subjection and obedience of the Lord Jesus.</HI> This power will appear to have been from God, if we consider,</P>
<P N="1">1. How <HI>few</HI> men were employed in the first preaching thereof; there were not many which we read of, besides <HI>Paul &amp; Barnabas</HI> who preached unto the <HI>Gentiles</HI> at the first. If there had been multitudes of witnesses, it might have given the more credit to the Doctrine, when the testimony of a few is not easily believed and received.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That these men were but of little esteem in the World;</HI> that they were Jews whom the Gentiles had an antipathy against; and so were not so ready to believe there report, and entertain their message; that their persons were con∣temptible in their eyes; that they were like crucified per∣sons to the world, and therefore unlikely to find accep∣tation.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That whatever humane Learning and Wisdom any of them were endowed withall, yet they did not make use of it in their preaching, they did not come with excellency of speech and wis∣dom in declaring the testimony of God, but used all plainness, which was not likely in it self to produce such great effects.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>That the doctrine which they preached was,</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>New</HI> to the world, and tended directly to pull down the old religion, and superstitious worship of the Heathenish
<PB N="147" REF="039280_0150_1033B29F4B45D188"/>
gods, which they had brought up in, and wedded unto, which could not be done by any humane power.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Strange,</HI> they preached such things as were above rea∣son, and therefore the world might have had much show and pretence of reason, to have excused themselves from yielding obedience thereunto.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Strict,</HI> severe, and contrary unto natural inclination and interest, they taught the world to deny themselves, to cruci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ie the flesh, to mortifie the deeds of the body, to take up the cross, to mourn and weep for sin, to endure hardship, to forsake father, and mother, and wife, and chil∣dren, and houses, and lands, if they stood in competition with Jesus Christ; to venture imprisonments, yea to lay down their life for Christ, as many of necessity must and did d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that would be Christians indeed in those dayes; and when the Doctrine of the Gospel was such, surely it was not likely of it self to receive entertainment, unless the power of God, had accompanied it.</P>
<P N="5">5. The power of the Gospel in the first preaching appears, <HI>in that it met with so much opposition; the Devil</HI> stirred up it struments against <HI>it, the powers of the Earth</HI> were against it, as well as <HI>the powers of Hell! great men</HI> did oppose it, <HI>Philosophers</HI> were against it, <HI>Learned men</HI> did oppose it; the <HI>Jews</HI> were against it, and raised up persecution against the Apostles, and <HI>the hearts of all men</HI> naturally were against it; and when there was such an opposition against it; surely it was none but the power of God which could cause it to prevaile and conquer, and cause so many Nations to bow and yield obedience hereunto.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The wonderful power and efficacy of the word, where it is preached unto this day,</HI> is a strong Argument that it is the Word of God.</P>
<P N="1">1. The power of the Word the <HI>search the heart, and con∣vince of sin. Heb.</HI> 4. 12. <HI>The word of God is quick and power∣ful and sharper than any two-edged Sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of the soul and spirit, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the hearts;</HI> there is a <HI>light</HI> in the Word, which discovereth the dark filthy corners of the heart,
<PB N="148" REF="039280_0151_1033B29D9A2E6480"/>
and convinceth of secret sins; and there is a <HI>sharp edge</HI> in the Word to cut and wound; no word in the world search∣eth and pierceth, like the word in the Scriptures.</P>
<P N="2">2. And especially the power of the Word doth appear in the work of <HI>Conversion and Regeneration,</HI> which it effecteth; it is called the <HI>incorruptible seed, by which men are born again <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Pet.</HI> 1. 23. <HI>Of his own will begat he us by the word of truth.

<P N="3">3. The Word is powerful, not only for the first working of grace, but also for <HI>the increase</HI> thereof, for the building up believers▪ <HI>Acts</HI> 20 32. for the perfecting of the Saints, and the edifying the body of Christ; there is Milk in the Word for babes▪ and strong meat for strong men; whol∣some words, which have much spiritual nourishing vertue in them: the Word is powerful, for the quenching Sathans fiery darts, for the repelling and driving back the tempter; for the comforting and rejoycing of distressed and disconso∣late souls, when they are brought even to the brink of de∣spair; there are no such joyes in the world, as those joyes which Christians sometimes finde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the reading and applying the Word, when they mingle it with faith, and have the breathings of the Spirit therewith; and there is no Book in the world that can produce such powerful effects, as the Scriptures do, wherefore it must needs follow, that these Scriptures are indeed the Word of God.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Scriptures appear to be the word of God▪ from the Historical relation in them of Prophecies fulfilled, &amp; of miracles,
<PB N="149" REF="039280_0152_1033B29C16C85A08"/>
whereby they were confirmed, and the rationally unquestionable certainty of this History, as it is handed down to posterity.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. In the Scriptures we have relation of <HI>Prophecies,</HI> and the <HI>fulfilling</HI> of them which doth prove those writings to be from God alone; because he alone can certainly foretell future things, indeed wise men may guess, and through prudence foresee the effects of some things in their causes, and foretell some things that are not very far off, yet not certainly, and with all their circumstances; But it is Gods prerogative to foresee and foretell such things (cer∣tainly, and with their circumstances; and long before the time) for which no cause in nature can be assigned, such as many of the Prophesies of the Scriptures were. By this Argument God doth by the Prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> prove the Hea∣thenish gods to be no gods, because they could not fore∣tell future events. <HI>Isai.</HI> 41. 21, 22 23. <HI>Produce your cause saith the Lord, bring forth your strong reasons: Let them shew is what shall happen, and declare to us things to come: shew the things which are to come hereafter, that we may know, that ye are Gods.

It would take up two much room in this small Treatise, to enumerate all the Prophesies of Scripture; take two or three instances. See <HI>Gen.</HI> 15. 13, 14. God foretelling to <HI>Abraham</HI> that his seed should be strangers in a Land, which was not theirs, and serve them, &amp; be afflicted by them <HI>four hundred years,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that afterward they, should come forth with great sub∣stance.

<P N="2">2. In the Scripture we have relation of <HI>Miracles,</HI> where∣by they were confirmed: such as the Plague of <HI>Egypt;</HI> the dividing of the Sea for the <HI>Israclites</HI> to pass thorow; the raining of Manna from Heaven; the standing still, and going back of the Sun: the preservation of the three Chil∣dren in the fiery Furnace, and the like, in the old Testa∣ment; especially the Miracles wrought by our Saviour and his Disciples, which the new Testament do record, such as healing the sick, the lame, blind, deaf, leprous, by a word, the feeding many thousands with a few Loaves of bread, the calming of the Sea, the raising of the dead after burial, and the like, all which did exceed the power of nature; and however wonderful things, might be wrought by Men in a praestigiatory way, which God may permit some to be delu∣ded withall; yet all true Miracles, as these were, could be wrought by none without his immediate power, which he would never put forth for the confirmation of lies and de∣ceits; therefore we may strongly argue from hence, that the Scriptures which have been confirmed by these Miracles, are indeed the Word of God. I know the great question then will be, whether there were ever such Miracles wrought, which the Scriptures makes mention of, whether the historical relation both of Prophesies and Miracles be not a forgery, for the introduction of the worship, which the Scriptures calls for? therefore,</P>
<P N="3">3. I might show at large the rationally unquestionable certainty of Scripture-History, as handed to posterity; But in brief, when these things were so notable, and remarked in their times; when they were not done in corners; when

they were▪ the object of sense; when they were so many; when they had so many spectators and witnesses; when there are divers records of the same things, and all in the main agreeing; when the way they are declared i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, speaking so much simplicity in the relators; when there were so many Copies of the Records dispersed into so many divers places; when Enemies could not deny the truth of things recorded, only imputed them to other causes; when mention is made of these things in profane Histories; when we have the Writ∣ings of the ancient Fathers by us, who lived in all the Centuries between us, and the time of Christ, and wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h one consent acknowledge these things, who might easily have found ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the deceit, had there been any, when they lived some of them so neer to the days wherein the chief of these things were done; when we cannot rationally assign an end, which should move Christians to deceive themselves and posterity, since they expose themselves to such losses, per∣secutions, reproaches and afflictions by their profession of Christianity; neither can we rationally imagine how all the Christians in the World could meet together from so ma∣ny Countries, for the forging of things which were never done; much less how they should agree together about it; and least of all how they should keep this secret, but their adversaries would have found it out, and made it known, some hint of it would have been given in History; all these things being laid together, we may rationally conclude, that the History of the Scripture is as certain, yea more certain than any profane History, which we have the least doubt of; and if the Histories of Prophesies fulfilled, and Miracles wrought be true, it is a strong Argument that the Scriptures which hereby are confirmed, are indeed the word of God. These Arguments for the Divine Authority of the Scriptures may be sufficient to stop the mouths of gain-sayets, but without the testimony of the spirit in and by them, none will be sufficient to effect a saving faith. Thus it is evident from the truth, and divine Authority of the Scriptures, which do so clearly reveal and foretel it, that the Lord Jesus Christ will certainly appear to Judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="039280_0155_1033B296E61033A0"/>
The second Argument to prove the certainty of Christs ap∣pearance, may be drawn from the certainty of the Resur∣rection.</P>
<P N="2">2. Argu. <HI>If all the dead shall certainly be raised at the last day, and the Lord Jesus Christ shall raise them, then the appear∣ance of the Lord Jesus Christ to do it is certain; but all the dead shall certainly be raised at the last day, and the Lord Je∣sus Christ shall raise them, therefore the appearance of the Lord Jesus Christ is certain.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. That all the dead, which are or shall be brought into that state, shall be raised at the last day, is a truth so clear in the Scripture, that nothing is more clear. The general Resurrection of the dead is one great Article of our Christi∣an Faith; one Principle of the Doctrine of Christ made mention of by the Apostle: <HI>Heb.</HI> 6▪ 1, 2. The dead <HI>small &amp; great</HI> shall be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atsed, and stand before God: <HI>Rev.</HI> 20. 12. We read of the Resurrection of the <HI>Just▪ Luke</HI> 14. 14. Of the Re∣surrection of the <HI>Just and Unjust▪ Acts</HI> 24. 15. I might mul∣tiply many Scriptures to prove this Doctrine of the Resurrecti∣on, but I shall further speak but of two places which pur∣posely treat thereof, and being so full of Arguments, I shall make use of no other than there I find for the evidencing of this truth.</P>
<P N="1">1. The former Scripture is in <HI>Matth.</HI> 22. from <HI>verse.</HI> 23. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the 34. <HI>The same day came the Saddnces to him, which say there is no Resurrection, and asked him▪ saying Master, Moses said, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f a Man die having no Children his Brother shall marry his Wife, and raise up Seed to his Brother. Now there were with we seven brethren, and the first when be had married a Wife, deceased, and having no issue, left his Wife unto his Brother. Likewise the second also, and the third unto the seventh; And last of all the Woman dyed also. Therefore in the Resurrection, whose wife shall she be of the seven▪ for they all had her: Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do erre, not knowing the Scrip∣tures, nor the power of God: For in the Resurrection, they nei∣ther marry nor are given in marriage, but are like the Angels
<PB N="153" REF="039280_0156_1033B2951A4D5E30"/>
of God in Heaven. But as touching the Resurrection of the dead, have yee not read that which was spoken unto you by God▪ say∣ing, I am the God of Abraham▪ and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing. And when the mullitude heard this, they were astonish∣ed at his Doctrine.</HI> And verse 34. it is said, <HI>He put the Sadduces to silence.</HI></P>
<P>Here we have a Disputation concerning the Doctrine of the Resurrection, wherein we may take notice of,</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>opponents,</HI> and they were the <HI>Sadduces,</HI> who denied the Resurrection, they denyed the immortality of the Soul, for they said there was no Angel nor Spirit: <HI>Acts</HI> 23. 8. And they denyed the Resurrection of the body.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Respondent;</HI> and that was the <HI>Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> the wisdome of the Father; he that when he was but twelve years old, did dispute with the Doctors in the Temple, and filled all that heard him with astonishment at his understand∣ing and answers, <HI>Luke</HI> 2 46, 47. And much more now, when he was so much encreased in wisdom, was he able to deal with the <HI>Sadduces,</HI> and answer them about this truth, of which (he coming out of the bosome of the Father, and being ac∣quainted with his secrets) he had so perfect knowledge; he had answered the <HI>Herodians</HI> before most wisely to their ensnaring question, whether it were lawful to pay tribute to <HI>Coe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar;</HI> and he was able to give answer to the <HI>Sadduces</HI> about the Resurrection.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Objection</HI> of the <HI>Sadduces.</HI> Master, <HI>Moses</HI> said, &amp;c. their Argument against the Resurrection, is this: If there were a Resurrection, then there would be a confusion in Relati∣ons, insomuch as seven Men having been in this World married to one Woman, all of them would claim a propriety in her, and to whom should she belong, would not this breed a discord? Must not six of them with grief be deprived of her, who once was their Wife? And could this agree with the state of perfection and happiness, in which all the just should be raised? The <HI>Sadduces</HI> thought now they had out Saviour upon the hip; they thought now it is likely, that they should confound him with this Argument, that they
<PB N="154" REF="039280_0157_1033B2939568F118"/>
should gravel him and shame him before the People; they could not answer it themselves, and they thought that our Saviour could not answer it neither; and truly the ob∣jection hath subtilty in it.</P>
<P N="4">4. The <HI>answer</HI> of our Saviour lies in vers. 30 <HI>In the Resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like the Angels of God in Heaven.</HI> Hereby he gives them to understand that there would be no confusion in Relati∣ons at the Resurrection, that there would be no enjoyment or deprivation of conjugal Relations there, because such Relati∣ons would then cease; and Men and Women would then be like Angels, which neither have such Relations, neither do stand in need of them; the end of such Relations will then cease, and the Relation will cease too.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>One end of the conjugal Relation here, is, the propagation of Man kind insomuch as the number is incompleat, and will be incompleat till the end of the World, and the number is com∣pleating by Generation▪ but at the Resurrection the number of Man kind will be compleat; the number of the Elect will be perfect, and in this regard they will be like to Angels▪ whose number was compleat at the first and therefore this end of mar∣riage ceasing, the Relation should cease also.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Another end of marriage is mutual help; and this end also will cease; at the Resurrection the wicked they shall have no help, the righteous shall have no need of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from such Relati∣ons; God will supply All, they will be perfect in him; God will be All, and in All: God will be instead of Father, Mo∣ther, Husband, Wife, and all unto them, like Angels they shall behold the Face of their Father, and have no need of conjugal Relations.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. And with this Answer to the <HI>Sadduces</HI> Objection, we may take notice of Christs Discovery of their <HI>errour,</HI> and the grounds thereof, namely their ignorance of the Scrip∣tures, and the power of God; whereby, our Saviour doth suggest a strong Argument, to prove the Doctrine of the Resurrection, drawn from the power of God, and the Scrip∣tures; the Argument is this. <HI>If there be power in God to raise the Dead, and in the Scriptures he hath revealed that he
<PB N="155" REF="039280_0158_1033B291E1DBD0F0"/>
will do it, then there will certainly be a Resurrection of the Dead; But there is power in God to raise the dead, and in the Scriptures he hath revealed that he will do it.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That there is Power in God to raise the Dead, is evident, and none which acknowledge his Deity can rationally deny; he that had power to make the World out of nothing, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ath power to raise the Dead out of their Graves; he that had power to give life, hath power to restore it; he that hath all power, hath this power; he who is infinite in power, who is omnipotent, unto whom nothing is difficult, he can raise the dead, and joyn soul and body together after a long separation. There is little doubt, but God can raise the dead▪ but the great question lyes in his will, whether he will or no, Therefore,</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Scriptures reveal his will herein; be that in the Scrip∣tures hath promised that he will raise the dead, being (o pow∣erful and faithful, he will certainly do it; but God hath pro∣mised in the Scriptures, that he will raise the dead. And though in the old Testament the Doctrine of the Resurrection be spoken of more obscurely yet our Saviour fetcheth a proof of the Doctrine out of the Book of Moses, which the Sadduces (as is observed) did only acknowledge. Vers.</HI> 31, 32 <HI>As touching the Resurrection of the Dead have y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e not read what was said to you by God, I am the God of Abraham, &amp;c. God is not the God of the dead, but of the living; our Saviour proves the Doctrine by strong inference drawn from this place, which needs a little opening to perceive the Argument.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It is not unlikely but our Saviour cleared the thing in more words, (for we have but the heads in Scripture of many things which were delivered in large discourses) he made it so clear that it fatisfied the people, and silenced the Sadduces.</HI></P>
<P>The Argument formed up is this: If God be the God of <HI>Abraham,</HI> and the God of <HI>Isaac,</HI> and the God of <HI>Jacob,</HI> when they are dead, then <HI>Abraham, Isaac, &amp; Jacob</HI> will rise again from the dead; and so there shall be a Resurrection from the dead; but God calls himself the God of <HI>Abraham,</HI> and the God of <HI>Isaac;</HI> and the God of <HI>Jacob,</HI> when they are dead, as they were, when he spake those words to <HI>Moses</HI> out of the bush; therefore they shall rise from the dead.
<PB N="156" REF="039280_0159_1033B28FD1421F10"/>
The consequence our Saviour proves, because he is the God of the living, and not of the dead <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> if that <HI>Abraham, &amp; Isaac, &amp; Jacob,</HI> be living before God, in regard of his purpose to raise them from the dead, because he is their God, when their bodies lie rotting in the grave, and there∣fore they may be called living when dead, <HI>by him who quick∣neth the dead, and causeth those things which are not</HI> (but shall be) <HI>as though they were. Rom.</HI> 4. 17. then <HI>Abraham, &amp; Isaac, &amp; Jaoob</HI> shall be raised from the dead, as certain∣ly as if they were actually living; but they are living be∣for God, in regard of his purpose and promise to make them alive; which is evident from the nature of the co∣venant which he hath made with them, which doth include a promise of blessedness, and perfect happiness, which he will give unto them. If God be the <HI>God of Abraham, &amp; the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob,</HI> he is their God in covenant, and by consequence will make them perfectly happy, not only in regard of their souls, by receiving them into glory, when they dy; but also in regard of their bodies too, by raising them from the dead at the last day, till which time their happiness is but in part, and imper∣fect; and therefore hence may strongly be inferred▪ that they shall be raised; and by consequence all in covenant shall be raised, to receive the perfect happiness promised in the covenant; and by parity of reason, that all out of covenant shall be raised to receive the compleat punish∣ment threatned to sinners for their sins; and by conse∣quence that there shall be a general Resurrection. Thus our Saviour confirms this great doctrine of the Resurrection, whereby he stopped the mouths of the Sadduces; his an∣swer made the people astonished, and the Sadduces con∣founded; they came with their mouths open, but they went away with their mouths shut; they came with full cry, but they went away in silence; he put the Sadduces to silence.</P>
<P N="2">2. The second Scripture to prove the Resurrection, is in 1 <HI>Cor. Cap.</HI> 15. thorowout; It seemeth, that some a∣mongst the <HI>Corinthians</HI> who called themselves Christians▪ did
<PB N="157" REF="039280_0160_1033B28E4E467EC8"/>
deny the Resurrection; now the scope of the Chapter is to refute this dangerous errour, and to prove the truth, which the Apostle doth by several Arguments.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The first Argument is drawn from the Resurrection of Christ;</HI> If Christ be risen from the dead, then believers which are his members, shall be raised also; he will not suffer his members to lie for ever rotten in the grave, because his mystle I body then would never he grown up unto per∣fection: Christ is the first fruits of them that sleep, <HI>V.</HI> 10. As certainly as he was awakened out of his sleep in the grave on the third day, so certainly shall all those that do, or shall sleep in Jesus, be awakened out of their grave at the last day: But Christ is certainly risen from the dead, which the Apostle proves,</P>
<P N="1">1. From the Prediction thereof in the Scriptures, as his death was foretold, so also his resurrection was foretold in the type of <HI>Jonab's</HI> being cast out of the belly of the whole on the third day.</P>
<P N="2">2. From the testimony of those persons to whom the Lord Jesus Christ did appear after his Resurrection, namely of <HI>Cephas,</HI> all the Apostles, above five hundred brethren at once, who law him before his Ascension; and last of all, in that he was seen by himself upon the way to <HI>Damascus</HI> after his Ascensi∣on: all which witnesses did with one mouth confirm the truth of Christs Resurrection.</P>
<P N="3">3. From the absurdities which would follow if Christ were not risen.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Apostles would then be found false witnesses and the Spirit of God which spake in them, would be a false spirit, which is impossible.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Then their preaching would be in vain, and the whole doctrine of Christianity, which was built partly upon this founda∣tion, would fall to the ground.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Then their faith would be i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> vain: because if Christ were still dead, he would not be a meet object for their faith, for then he could not be the Son of God, nor a Mediatour between God and man.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Then Believers would be yet in their sins; their sins would
<PB N="158" REF="039280_0161_1033B28CCAF636A0"/>
remain un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ardoned; because satisfaction to Gods justice would not have been compleated, had the bonds of death still held our Saviour.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Then they which were fallen asleep in Christ would be pe∣rished in regard of their bodies, like the beasts when they die; because if Christ were not risen, it would be impossible that they should ever rise any more.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Then believers should have hope only in this life; be∣cause if Christ were not risen and ascended into Heaven, to pre∣pare room for them there, they could not have any good-grounded hope of ever being received into that place; and by consequence it would follow, that believers, the best of men, upon the earth, would be the most miserable men of all others, because they are exposed to so many sufferings for the sake of Jesus Christ: If they had hope only in this life, they would be most miserable in regard of sorrow, (though not in regard of sin) for their hopes of future glory do support and comfort them under all their af∣flictions; if they should loose their hopes, they would loose their comforts, and be of all others the most forlorn and sorrowful; it would break their hearts, and bring them to despair. Cer∣tainly then Christ is risen, and as certainly shall the dead be raised.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The second Argument whereby the Apostle proves the Resurrection, is drawn from the Paralel between the <HI>first Adam,</HI> and Christ the <HI>second Adam,</HI> V. 21. &amp;c. <HI>Since by man came death by man also shall come the Resurrection; for as in Adam all die, so in Christ shall all be made alive.</HI> By <HI>Adam</HI> sin came into the world, and death by sin, and death passed upon all his posterity, because all have sinned, at least in him: By Christ came righteousness into the world, and by righteousness life▪ and all his posterity shall be raised by him unto eternal life at the last day, because all are partakers of his righteousness.</P>
<P N="3">3. The third Argument is drawn from the reign of Christ at the right hand of the Father, until all his enemies be put under his feet; and the last enemy which shall be destroyed is Death; and death is no wayes perfectly destroy∣ed, but by the Resurrection of the dead out of their graves,
<PB N="159" REF="039280_0162_1033B28AE7A66018"/>
and the putting immortality upon the body: then when this corruptible shall put on incorruption, and this mortal shall put on immortality, death shall be swallowed up in victory; therefore since death, with other enemies, shall be put under Christ's feet, it is of necessity that there should be a Resurrection.</P>
<P N="4">4. The fourth Argument is in <HI>V.</HI> 29. <HI>Else what shall they do that are baptized for the dead: if the dead rise not, why are they baptized for the dead?</HI> The words are diffi∣cult; various are the interpretations which are given; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> like <HI>Caloins</HI> best; if it will hold with the words, Why are they baptized for the dead, or for dead? that is, why are they that are dying, and given over for dead? baptized? if the dead rise not; why will any when they are going one of the world be baptized in the name of Christ? if they did not hope for a Resurrection at the last; that as they are buried with him by baptism unto death, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they should rise with him not only unto newness of life here, but also unto everlasting life and glory hereafter.</P>
<P N="5">5. The fifth Argument is drawn from the Jeopardie and sufferings of Christians, which they would not undergoe unless they had hopes of the Resurrection.</P>
<P N="6">6. The denial of this Doctrine opens a door to Licenci∣ousness. People would eat and drink▪ and let loose the reigns to sensual delights, and commit sin with greediness, if they must die, and there were no hopes of a Resurrection to glory and happiness, and no fears of a Resurrection to torment and misery.</P>
<P><HI>Besides Scripture testimony and Argument, which is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> firm proof of the Resurrection. I might add for illustration, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me. Emblems of the Resurrection in nature▪</HI></P>
<P>Naturalists tell us of a <HI>Phoenix</HI> which riseth out of the shes, into which she had burned her self before; but i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> more certain, that some birds lie in holes dead all the win∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and get life again in the Summer; we see Plants, Herbs, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lowers, and the like wither in the Winter, and spring forth gain when the cold weather is gone; we see the Sun <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> night, and arise again in the morning; and we ourselves
<PB N="160" REF="039280_0163_1033B288CF01FAE0"/>
as we have an Emblem of death upon us when we are asleep, so our awaking again, and arising from our beds, it an Emblem of our Resurrection at the last day. It is certain that the dead shall be raised▪ which hath been proved.</P>
<P N="2">2. And secondly, it is as certain that Christ shall raise them. <HI>I will raise them at the last day. Joh.</HI> 6. 40. this is spoken of believers; but it is spoken also of all, <HI>Joh</HI> 5. 28,29. <HI>The hour is coming, in which all that are in their graves; shall hear his voice and come forth: they that have done good to the Resur∣rection of life, and they that have done evil, to the Resurrection of damnation.</HI></P>
<P>Hence it strongly follows, If the dead shall certainly be raised, and the Lord Jesus shall raise them, that the appear∣ance of Christ to do it, is certain.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Argu.</HI> The third Argument to prove the certainty of Christ's second appearance may be drawn from the certainty of the last general Judgment.</P>
<P><HI>If there will certainly be a day of general Judgment, and the Lord Jesus Christ will be the Judge; then the second appear∣ance of Christ is certain: But there will be certainly a day of general Judgment, and the Lord Jesus Christ will be the Judge; therefore Christs appearance is certain.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The certainty of the last judgment is evident from Scripture, <HI>Heb</HI> 6 2. 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3. 9. <HI>Rom</HI> 25,6,7. and elsewhere frequently, and I shall further prove it by Scripture Ar∣guments.</P>
<P>It doth appear there will be a day of Judgment,</P>
<P N="1">1. From Gods <HI>appointment. Acts</HI> 17. 31. <HI>He hath appointed a day wherein he will Judge the world in righteousness.</HI> God appointed the Creation of the world, which accordingly he effected: he appointed the reconciliation of the world to himself, which he brought to pass; and having appointed the Judgment of the world it shall as certainly be brought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pass in its day. Nothing can frustrate God's appoint∣ments, God being so infinite in wisdom, doth not appoint any thing about which there shall be any reason to alter his de∣termination;
<PB N="161" REF="039280_0164_1033B28749F18C28"/>
and God being so infinite in power, nothing can hinder the effecting of what he hath determined shall be done.</P>
<P N="2">2. From Gods <HI>Supreme and Universal Soveraignty;</HI> he is the blessed and the great Potentate, which rules over all the Kingdoms of the earth; <HI>He is the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,</HI> 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 6. 15. All the children of men are not only his creatures, but also his subjects. As it is the work of earthly Kings to judge their subjects, and to dispense re∣wards and punishments: so God being the supreme Sove∣raign, will judge all his subjects; Kings are but Gods Vice∣gerents, they rule under him, and they must give an ac∣count unto him; God will judge the judges of the Earth; men do often judge unrighteously, sometimes through their own wickedness and partiality; sometimes through igno∣rance and false information; the righteous are condemned by some, and notorious offenders are acquitted; and those which judge most righteously, cannot find out all that should fall under the lash of he Law, and the strictest laws of men do not reach all offences against God; therefore there is need that the Soveraign Lord and King should call the whole world to another judgement, which will be at the last day.</P>
<P N="3">3. From Gods most <HI>excellent Wisdom</HI> in the mannagement of his government over the children of men; the wisdom of God now is much out of sight, and is little taken notice of in the world: there seems now to be a great disorder and confusion in the government of men; the most faithful subjects of the King of Heaven in most places are trodden un∣der foot, and have many bitter cups put into their hands; and the most vile Traitors and Rebels▪ against the highest Majesty, are lifted up into the seat of honour, and spend much of their dayes in mirth and jollity; we read in Scrip∣ture of the various and great afflictions of Gods People. <HI>Heb.</HI> 11. 36 37. Some there were <HI>mocked, and scourged, and tortured, they were sawen asunder, they were slain with the Sword. they wandered about in Sheep-skins, and Goat skins, being destitute, afflicted and tormented,</HI> and yet such as the <HI>World was not worthy of;</HI> whereas it is said of the wicked, <HI>Psal.</HI> 73 5,7,10.
<PB N="162" REF="039280_0165_1033B285C6E07F80"/>
<HI>Their eyes stand out with fatness, they have more than heart could wish, and Waters of a full Cup are wrung out unto them; and they are not in trouble like other Men, neither are they plagued like other Men. S</HI>ee also <HI>Psal.</HI> 17. 14. <HI>Job.</HI> 21. <HI>from the</HI> 7 <HI>vers. to the</HI> 14<HI>th.</HI></P>
<P>So that if there were not another Judgment, God would seem to have been an ill-contriver of Government for the welfare of his people, and to have ill-consulted his own glory in the World; yea his enemies would seem to have out∣witted him; therefore it is needful there should be a day of Judgment, when all things shall be set at rights, and put in order▪ when Gods wisdom all along shall plainly appear in the view of all, and his glory be made manifest; when his people shall be exalted, and his enemies debased.</P>
<P N="4">4. From the infinite holiness of God, now the holiness of God i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> trampled under foot by ungodly sinners; they scorn and deride it, where ever they see any Image or appear∣ance thereof; they scoff at the name of a Saint; they hate holiness, and many do their uttermost to banish it the World; which is a high affront, which such Persons offer to the highest Majesty in this high attribute; it is therefore ne∣cessary that there should be a day of Judgment, that God may redeem the honour of his holiness, which now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s under such contempt; then he will make his holiness to shine with an amazing excellency in the eyes of all those that did dispise it.</P>
<P N="5">5. From Gods <HI>justice and Righteousness;</HI> God hath given unto Man a most just and righteous Law, and annexed threatnings of everlasting punishment, which he will inflict upon the breakers thereof; Gods justice cannot be satisfied without execution of his vengeance in the punishment of all transgressors, except it be of such who have an interest in the satisfaction, which was made by the Lord Jesus Christ; and all the Children of <HI>Adam</HI> being transgressours, and very few of them having an in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> in Christ and his merits, and none receiving condigne punishment for their sins in this life; therefore there will be a day for the revelation of the just and righteous judgment of God, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2. 5. This righte∣ousness
<PB N="163" REF="039280_0166_1033B283C644FEE8"/>
of God doth engage him not to punish the wicked for their sins, but also to give his people that reward which the Lord Jesus Christ hath purchased and prepared for them; therefore there must be a day for him to do it in.</P>
<P>Thus it doth appear, that there will be a day of gene∣ral Judgment.</P>
<P N="2">2. That Christ will be the Judge▪ is also evident from Scripture, <HI>Acts</HI> 17. 31. <HI>He hath appointed▪ a day wherein <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e will judge the World in righteousness by the Man whom he hath ordained, whereof he hath given assurance unto all Men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.</HI> And <HI>Rom.</HI> 14. 10. <HI>We shall all stand before the Judgment Seat of Christ.</HI> And 2 <HI>Cor</HI> 5. 10. <HI>For we must all appear before the judgment Seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in this body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</HI> And Christs judicial proceedings is set forth at large, <HI>Matth.</HI> 25. Hence then it follows, that the Lord Jesus Christ shall certainly appear to Judgment. I might add other Argu∣ments drawn from the faith, and hope, and expectations of the righteous, and Christs faithfulness, love, and the engage∣ment of his honour to appear again, but so much con∣cerning the certainty of Christs second appearance.</P>

There∣fore

our dayes are called <HI>the last dayes.</HI> 2 <HI>Tim</HI> 3 1. <HI>And upon us the ends of the World are come,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10, 11. We live in the end of the World, in the last dayes, in the old age thereof. The World hath as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were three ages, the youth, the middle age, and the old age 3. the Youth of the World was from the creation to the Flood, the middle age from the Flood to the first coming of Christ; the old A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> from the first coming of Christ to the second▪ com∣ing, the old age and last dayes of the World began in the Apostles time, now many of them are spent, and we are come not only to the declining years, but also to the decrepit age of the World; and if the Lord Jesus Christ were to come shortly in the dayes of the Apostle, much, more shortly will he come now, when so many years are past since the Scripture was writ, and these things foretold.</P>
<P>If any should doubt of the certainty of Christs appear∣ance, because the Scripture speaks of the speediniss thereof, as if Christ had been in those dayes presently to come, and yet above sixteen hundred years are past, since the pro∣mise was made.</P>
<P>I answer, that the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> who in his first Epistle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the <HI>Thessalonians</HI> spake of Christs coming as if it might be in his time, 1. <HI>Thess.</HI> 4. 16, 17. <HI>The Lord himself will descend from Heaven with a shout, &amp;c. And the dead in Christ shall rise first; then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up in the Clouds, &amp;c.</HI> The same Apostle tells the <HI>Thessalonians</HI> in his second Epistle, <HI>Chap.</HI> 2. 3. <HI>That the day of the Lord should not come till there was a falling away, and the Man of sin should be revealed, &amp;c.</HI> And <HI>vers.</HI> 7. That there was then a lett to the Revelation of the Man of sin, which was the Heathenish <HI>Romane</HI> Empire which lett was not likely in haste, neither was removed till some hundred of years after; and therefore it is evident from that place, that the coming of the Lord was not to be until several ages after the writing of the Scriptures. This may be sufficient to give satisfaction concerning the length of time, since the Scripture tells us that the Lord Jesus would quickly appear.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="039280_0168_1033B2805C00E648"/>
If any profane Mockers shall scoff at this answer, and say, where is the Promise of his coming? Do not all things remain as they were since the Creation? Do not the Sun, and Moon, and Stars keep their constant course? And what likelihood of the darkning of the Sun, and falling of the Stars, and the passing away of the Heavens with a great noise? Is not the Earth established upon sure foundations, and what likelihood of moving it and burning it, with the works which are upon it? and if Christ would have come so quickly, would not he have been here before now? I answer,</P>
<P N="1">1. That the <HI>Apostle Peter</HI> foretels, that in the last days such scoffers should arise. 2. <HI>Pet.</HI> 3. 3,4.</P>
<P N="2">2. That all things are not as they were from the Creation, for the World in the time of <HI>Noah</HI> was drowned with the Flood, <HI>Noah</HI> only excepted, and those which were with him▪ in the Ark; surely there was a great transformation of things in that age, <HI>Vers.</HI> 5,6.</P>
<P N="3">3. That by the same word of command, whereby the old World was drowned with Water, by the same Word, the World that now is shall be burned with <HI>Fire at the day of Judgment and perdition of the ungodly, Vers.</HI> 7.</P>
<P N="4">4. That though many hundred years be past since the promise, that the Lord would come quickly, yet there is not a failure, in regard of God; for though the time be long, in regard of our account, who are of so short continuance; and time seems tedious to us, because of the miseries of our short life; yet in regard of the eternal God, the time is but short, for in his sight <HI>a thousand years is out as one day, and by that account there are not yet two dayes past since the promise. Vers.</HI> 8.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>The reason of Gods protracting this appearance of Jesus Christ to Judgment, is for our sakes; it is from his long∣suffering to us ward, that hereby he might lead us unto repen∣tance, Verse.</HI> 9. The Lord hath a number to be called, some of which may be unborn, others not yet new-born, but scatterred amongst the wicked; but when the Elect▪ are all called, and perswaded to repent, and believe, and
<PB N="166" REF="039280_0169_1033B27ECF7D64A0"/>
are gathered into Gods Family, I doubt not but the Lord Jesus Christ will be here immediately. The Lord Jesus surely now will come within a short time; the certain time of his appearance is unknown, <HI>Matth.</HI> 24. 36. <HI>But of the day and hour knoweth no Man, no not the Angels, but the Father only;</HI> this is a secret which God hath locked up in his own breast, it is written in the Book of this Decree, and however other things are revealed and unfolded to Men, yet the leaf where this i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> written is folded up and sealed, so that none can read it; yet surely it cannot be long before the mystery be finished, and Christ be revealed from Heaven; yet a little while and he will be here, he stands at the Door, and the Door will quickly be opened, and then he will make his appearance.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Lord Jesus Christ will come quickly, that is sud∣denly, and unexpectedly, especially in regard of the ungodly World. <HI>The day of the Lord will come as a snare upon all them that dwelt on the face of the whole Earth: Luke</HI> 21.34.35. <HI>And sudden destruction will then come upon the wicked, as pains on a Woman with Child:</HI> 1 <HI>Thess.</HI> 5 3 <HI>The Lord will come in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye;</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15. 52. <HI>As light∣ning cometh out of the East and shineth unto the West, so shall the coming of the Son of Man be: Matth</HI> 24. 27. Further, this coming of the Lord Jesus is set forth in Scripture.</P>

Men do not think of, they do not know of, they are not aware of, they do not desire the coming of Thieves: so the Lord will come at a time, which Men do not know of; when they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not think of it, when they are not aware of it; and he
<PB N="167" REF="039280_0170_1033B27CEA73FB20"/>
will be more unwelcome at his second appearance to the greatest part of the World, than a Thief, who comes sudden∣ly in the night, and breaks in upon their Houses, to steal their goods▪ and take away their lives; when the Lord Jesus shall suddenly unfold the Doors of Heaven, and come down in his glory, and summon the wicked to Judgment, how will they start, and be affrighted out of their deep sleep of security, and be filled with horrour and amazement!</P>
<P N="2">2. Christs coming is set forth by the coming of a Bride∣groom at midnight, in the Parable of the ten Virgins, <HI>Matth</HI> 25 6. <HI>At midnight there was a cry made, Behold the Bride∣groom cometh, go yee forth to meet him.</HI> The Virgins were all asleep, the Wise as well as the foolish, they did not expect the Bridegroom at that time; the coming of Christ will be sudden and unexpected, as to the particular time unto his own Disciples; yet they will quickly arise, and trim their Lamps▪ and receive him with joy, when the Lamps of the foolish Virgins, for want of Oyl, will go out, and they shall be shut out of the Bride-chamber of Heaven for ever.</P>
<P N="3">3. Christs coming is set forth by the coming of the Flood upon the old World, and <HI>Noah's</HI> entering into the Ark: <HI>Luke</HI> 17. 26,27. <HI>And as it was in the dayes of Noah, so shall it be in the dayes of the Son of Man; They did eat, they drank, they married Wives; they were given in marriage, untill the day that Noah entered into the Ark, and the Flood came and destroyed them all.</HI> The old World was very licentious, and secure in the dayes of <HI>Noah;</HI> though universal ruines and destruction were so near, yet it being a thing which was unseen, they did not expect it, nor take any care to prevent it. It is said of <HI>Noah, Heb.</HI> 11. 7. <HI>That by faith being warned of God; of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, he prepared an Ark to the saving of his house:</HI> By faith he knew that the Flood▪ would come, when there was no appearance of it, nor possibi∣lity, in regard of the ordinary way of the working of second causes; he believed it, because God who could effect it, and who cannot lie, had foretold it; and therefore he prepa∣red, according to Gods direction, this great Vessel, to defend himself and Family, and some living Creatures of every kind▪
<PB N="168" REF="039280_0171_1033B27B67C71EE8"/>
against the Waters, which he foresaw were coming upon the Earth; but the ungodly World, having no eye of saith, could not discern this unseen thing; it is most likely they heard often of it by <HI>Noah,</HI> who was a Preacher of righteousness; but they did not believe it, therefore they did not expect it, nor fear it, nor prepare for it: they a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and drank, and slept, &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d as if no such thing had been coming upon them: It is likely, when they saw <HI>Noah</HI> build the Ark, such a large and capacious Vessel, on the dry Land, that they scoffed at him, and accounted him no better than a mad-man, as we should do a Man that should build a Ship on the top of a Mountain, and expect that Waters should come up thither, and waft it away.</P>
<P>But when the dayes of a hundred and twenty years, which the Lord had appointed the old World to continue, after his threatning of their destruction, were expired; when the de∣cree had brought forth, and the year of Gods recompence was come, and the day of his fierce anger, wherein he sent the Flood upon the Earth, O the terrour and amazement which did surprize the secure sinners of the World at that time! when the Windows of Heaven were opened from above, out of which God looked forth upon sinners, with such a furi∣ous countenance, and poured forth his anger in such streames of water; and the Fountains of the great deep were opened from beneath, and the Flood began to arise, and lif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> up the head, and swell about them; when the Valleys were filled with running Waters, and the Plains were covered, as if they had been a S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>; when this enemy did combine so many For∣ces together (having a Commission from God to destroy) and strengthned it self on every side, and environed these rebellious sinners round about, and assailed them in every quarter; when not only smaller Cottages were over turned, but also the streames brake in with irresistible force upon the strongest and greatest edifices; when great Doors were lifted off of their hinges, or broken to pieces, and the Water (like a Thief) climbed in at the Windows, and roaring all about with a hideous noise, pursued those which fled from it, fol∣lowing them up stiars, even to the highest room until it had

Thus will it be at the second comming of the Lord Jesus Christ to judgement, his coming will be sudden and unex∣pected: the wicked of the earth will be eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage; they will be as sensual &amp; sinful, and as secure withal, as they are at this day; they are told frequently, by the preaching of the word, that the day of Judgement is appointed, and that it hastneth greatly; that the Lord Jesus Christ will come, and that he will come quickly; but they want faith to believe it, and therefore they do not expect it, nor fear it, nor prepare for it: It is said, <HI>Luke</HI> 18. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>When the Son of Man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?</HI> Some interpret this place as spoken not of Christs second personal coming to judgment; but of his comming in a way of eminent deliverance of his people from the cruelty and oppression of their enemies, which will be so strange and unexpected, because they shall be brought so low, insomuch that there will hardly be faith in any to believe a deliverance. Others interpret this place, as spea∣king of Christs last appearance to judgment; that the earth will then be generally secure▪ and that wicked men, and unbelievers, and oppressours of Gods people will abound, &amp; that true believers will be rare, and very hardly to be sound: I shall not determine which is the true sense of the place, but sure I am the wicked will be many, and very secure at the day of Christ's appearance; though the wicked be forewarned of this day, yet they do not believe this thing, than which nothing is more certain; the wicked, which are mingled amongst Gods people, think strange that they do not run with them unto the same excess of riot; they look up∣on them as no better than fools, and people besides them∣selves, when they see them deny themselves, sleight the plea∣sures and profits, and vanities of the world, and are so solli∣citous above all other things to prepare and Ark for the saving of their souls, to get an interest in Jesus Christ, typified by the Ark, that under his shelter they may be defended from the storm of Gods wrath, which shall beat upon the head of the wicked at the last day.

4.

Then all the sin∣ners of the place, whose sins before went up with such a loud cry into the ears of God, what a loud cry did they send forth out of every house under the sense of their torments? then the sons in law of <HI>Lot,</HI> who were forewarned, I beleive, were above others perplexed and filled with unspeakable vexation, that they did not hearken to the voice of their Fa∣ther, and remove with him from that place before the Fire came; then they knew he did not mock them, but was in good earnest, and that his words were not idle tales, but the truth of Gods intention, which he was sent to give them no∣tice of: <HI>Sodom</HI> is now made a fiery Furnace, and all the wicked of the place are consumed together suddenly and un∣expectedly.</P>

The world is very wicked, and the longer it doth continue, the worse it grows; the fins of the wicked world, like the sins of <HI>Sodom</HI> have gone up with a loud Cry of God; and the Lord hath exercised his patience a long time to lead them unto re∣pentance; and if there had not been some righteous persons on the Earth, the day of Judgment would have been long ago; if there had not been some <HI>Lots</HI> in <HI>Sodom,</HI> I mean some Elect Persons in their sins▪ that are yet to be called, and some as yet un-born, that must be gathered, the World would ere this have been consumed for the wickedness thereof; there is a measure appointed for the Worlds sins, which will be filled up▪ and there is a number appointed of chosen Persons, who ere long will be brought in, and so soon as <HI>Lot</HI> is got into <HI>Zoar, G</HI>od rains Fire and Brimstone on <HI>Sodom;</HI> and I con∣ceive that so soon as all the Elect Persons are got into Christ, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> then Christ will appear to Judgment; and as it was in the dayes of <HI>Lot,</HI> so will it be on the day of Christs appearance; the wicked of the World will be secure, eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building.</P>

The day before Christ cometh will be a <HI>merry day</HI> with some ungodly sinners, they will be eating and drinking, feasting and carouzing, singing and rejoycing, and putting the evil day far from them; even when it is so very neer▪ but how will their chear be changed the next morning▪ how will their singing be turned into howling, and their joy into heaviness and dreadful terrour?</P>
<P>The day before will be a <HI>gainfull day,</HI> it may be with many in their buying and selling, possibly they may have got a good bargain in their buying and got good profit in their selling; and it may be a <HI>busie day</HI> with others in their planting and building, which may fill their time and thoughts with Worldly, care and contrivements for many years to come, little thinking that the World is not of a years, nor two dayes standing longer, but O what terrour will seize upon these Worldings the next morning, when Christ doth appear to judge them! and they find, that whilst they have gained something in the World, which they cannot now keep, and will yield no profit in this day of wrath, that then have lost their souls and happiness for ever, which they cannot regain; that whilst they have been busie about trifles, they have neglected the one thing necessary; then they will wish, that instead of planting Trees in their Ground, they had spent their time in getting grace planted in their hearts; that in∣stead of building Houses for their bodies, they had laid a good foundation for this time, and got a title to the building of God, the House not made with hands, which is durable and eternal.</P>
<P>The day before Christs coming will be a <HI>sinning day</HI> with all the wicked, and a <HI>day of general security;</HI> some will be swearing and cursing, others will be oppressing and grinding the faces of the poor, others will be reproaching and per∣secuting of Gods people; and the very night before, it may be many wicked Persons may be got together Carding, and Dicing, and Drinking all night unto Drunkenness, and others may be got into the unclean Bed, and there lie in their filthiness, and all will be sleeping in sin and security; but the sound of the last Trumpet will startle and awaken them

repent until hereafter, a pardon will be unattainable; there, will remain no sacrifice for sin; then the day of grace will be quite spent; and the Door of mercy will be fast shut: then Jesus Christ will have finished his interceding work, and it will be impossible to obtain remission.</P>
<P N="4">4. If you repent of sin now, <HI>you may get strength against sin; you shall be delivered from the reigning power of sin present∣ly and you shall be freed from the rage and tyranny of sin by degrees and at the last you shall obtain a perfect freedome from the being of sin, and be wholly delivered from the bondage of cor∣ruption.

but in order unto your comfort, and therefore it shall not be of long continuance; your grief for sin doth make way for spiritual comforts, for the joyes of the holy Ghost, which after sorrowing times the Lord doth often give in a∣bundantly unto his Children in this World; in which they finde incomparably more sweetness, than ever they could finde sweetness in sin, or bitterness in sorrow; they have pleasures of a higher and more transcendent nature; be sure your grief for sin will make way for your everlasting joyes in Heaven, where all teares shall be wiped away from your eyes, and all sorrow and sighing shall be removed from your hearts, and you shall obtain gladnesse unspeakable &amp; everlasting But if you do not repent until hereafter, as the pleasures which you finde in sin▪ will be but for a season, and your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng but short, Death be sure will put a conclusion unto all: so your grief for sin then will be long, the dayes of darkness and sorrow will be many, yea your grief will be eternal.</P>

<P N="2">2. If you defer your repentance, <HI>it is a thousand to one that you never repent as long as you live,</HI> If your life should continue many years; because not one in a thousand that defer their repentance, do afterwards repent; there are millions in Hell that lived under the light of the Gospel who intended to repent, but were prevented by death before they were aware; and it is a thousand to one if you defer any longer, but ere long you will be received into their num∣ber; have not you deferred your repentance before this till such a time and such a time? and yet when such times

<P N="3">3 The longer you defer your repentance, <HI>the more difficult will you finde the work to be</HI> because you will be the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ster bound in Sathans chains, and not so easily loosn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>; because you will be the faster asleep in sin, and not so easily a∣wakened; because your hearts will grow the harder by the long practice of sin, and not so easily broken; because your sins will be more encreased which you must repent of; be∣cause your time will be the more decreased which you are to repent in; so that if it should come to passe (which is a thou∣sand to one) that you should repent after procrastination or deferring repentance; yet you will finde the work to be very difficult.</P>
<P N="4">4. Think <HI>what glory you may bring to God,</HI> what service you may do if you repent and reform presently; all which time, whilest you defer repentance, is spent in the service of the Devil and your own lusts, unto the dishonour of God.</P>
<P N="5">5. Think <HI>what measures of grace and comfort you may at∣tain here, and what degrees of Glory you may attain hereafter, if you repent without delay, which by deferring the work, you are like to lose.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. If you defer Repentance, <HI>it is a question whether your last repentance will be true;</HI> and if it should be true it is a question whether ever you shall obtain the evidence of the truth thereof.</P>
<P N="7">7. And lastly, If you defer your Repentance, <HI>God may never call you to repentance;</HI> yea, he may give you up to a judiciary hardness<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and seal you up unto condemnati∣on, swearing in his wrath that you shall never enter in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his Rest. Thus much for the exhortation of Sinners to repent.</P>

</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>For the Tryal of Believers;</HI> the Doctrine of Christs cer∣tain and sudden appearance to Judgment, is a m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st dread∣ful Doctrine to sinners, which are <HI>in sin;</HI> and it is a most comfortable Doctrine to believers, which are <HI>in Christ:</HI> but because many sinners, which are still held fast in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ond of iniquity, and are under the reigning power of some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ns, are art to mistake, and without good ground do per∣swade themselves that they are believers, who at the last day will be found to be hypocrites; and through their mis∣take of their state do ward off those strokes of Gods threat∣nings which are made at them, and themselves hereby from those terrible apprehensions of Christs appearance to Judge and condemn them, which did they entertain, might be a meanes to startle them, and awaken them to take an effectual and speedy course for the salvation of themselves from future vengeance; and because many true believers, who are really united unto Christ by faith, are apt also through the temptation of Sathan, and their own ignorance, and doubting misgiving-heart, to mistake themselves, and look upon themselves to be hypocrites, and therefore fear

that when Christ doth appear, that they shall be condem∣ned by him, being so ready to condemn themselves, and therefore gather matter for trouble from this Doctrine, which indeed is matter of the greatest comfort; therefore it will be needful for the undeceiving of the former, that they may not falsly apply comfort, and the rectifying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he mistakes of the latter, that they may not put off comfort, to make some tryal of true believers: It would be too large to present to you all the character which we may finde in the Word of God of true believers: therefore I shall make mention but of one, which the Text holds forth, and is the second Doctrine observed from the Words, in the begining of our Discourse.</P>
<P>DOCT. 2. <HI>That there is an earnest desire in the Church, or true Believers, after the second appearance of the Lord Je∣sus Christ</HI></P>
<P>You may try your selves whether you are true Belie∣vers by your desires after Christs appearance; this is the Character which the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> giveth of Believers, that they are such as love, and by consequence desire the appear∣ance of the Lord Jesus Christ: 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 8. <HI>Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteousness, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Lord, the Righteous Judge shall give me at that day; and not to me only, but also to all them that love his appearance:</HI> All such, and none but such shall have a Crown of Righteous∣ness, who love Christs appearing; Believers are said to look for Christs coming, <HI>Heb.</HI> 9 28. <HI>Unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time, without sin unto salvati∣on.</HI> He will appear unto all, but only to them that look for him, will he appear unto salvation. Believers look for Christs appearance, with an <HI>eye of faith, of hope, and of desire.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Believers look for Christs appearance with <HI>an eye of faith;</HI> they expect it as sure as death, yea as more s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re, because the death of some will be prevented by it; it is not impossible that the Lord Jesus should come in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> days: they surely believe that the Lord will come.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="208" REF="039280_0211_1033B30D9A5881C0"/>
2. Believers look for the appearance of Christ with <HI>an eye of hope; Tit.</HI> 2 13 <HI>Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearance of the great God, and our Saviour.</HI> As they have hopes of the glory of Heaven, so they have hopes of the coming of Christ, who will receive them into glory, who will put the Crown upon their Heads, and bring them with Tri∣umph unto the new <HI>Jerusalem.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3 Believers look for the appearance of Christ with <HI>an eye of love and desire;</HI> they love and long for his appearance, they look with many a glance of love towards the Pallace above, where their Lord is, and they have many a longing wish, that he would come forth, and come down, and receive them unto himselfe, that where he is, there they may be also. The Bride saith <HI>come,</HI> and the desire of the Spouse is <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke haste my beloved and be as a Roe noon the Mountains of Spines: Cant</HI> 8. 14. Believers pray, Thy <HI>Kingdome come,</HI> in the Lords Prayer, which he taught his Disciples, they desire the com∣ing, not only of the Kingdome of grace, but also of the King∣dome of glory; and in the Text, the Church breathes forth, this desire, after Christs appearance, <HI>Amen, even So come Lord Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>Now examine your selves whether you are true believers by this Character. Do you love and desire Christs appear∣ance?</P>
<P>Object. <HI>If any object against themselves, and say, alas! we fear then we are no true believers, because we cannot say that we love and desire Christs appearance, we are so far from de∣siring it, that we are afraid of it, and it is matter of the great∣est trouble unto us to think of it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 1. See you to that, many go under the name of believers, which have only the name; take heed that none of you Be found in the number of such, at the last day.</P>
<P N="2">2. Possibly some of you may condemn your selves without reason, as Gods Children are more forward to do than hypo∣crites, who have the most reason; It may be you do not desire that Christ should come immediately, but do not you desire that Christ should come at all? a Wife may sin∣cerely and greatly desire the coming home of her Husband,

<P>Quest <HI>How shall we know whether our desires after Christs coming be sincere?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. If you love Christs person, it is a sign your desires after his coming are sincere; we desire the com∣ing of friends to us, whome we love; Do you love Christ in sincerity? Do you love him for himself, for his own ex∣cellencies, this loveliness, his love, and spiritual love-tokens? do you love him upon a spiritual account?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>If you do sincerely desire the coming of Christ into your hearts in regard of his Spirit and grace it is a sign you have sincere desires after his coming in glory; when grace will arrive to its perfection; Can you understandingly and heartily <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Thy: Kingdom come; I mean, that Christ's Kingdom of Grace should be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrected in your hearts: and are sincerely de∣si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous to have all things within you brought into subjection and o∣bedience thereunto?
