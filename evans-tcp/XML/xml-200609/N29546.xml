<HEAD>A Congratulatory Address, Of the House of Representatives of His Majesties Province of New-Hampshire, Conven'd in General Assembly, August 7th. Anno Domini. 1699. To His Excellency RICHARD, Earl of BELLOMONT, Captain General and Governour in Chief of His Majesties Provinces of the Massachusetts Bay, New-York, and New-Hampshire, in New-England, and Vice Admiral of the same.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please Your Excellency,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE His Majesties most Loyal and Dutiful Sub∣jects the Representatives of this Province, being deeply sensible of the many hazards which attended Your Noble Person both by Sea and Land; cannot but acknowledge the Benign Influences of Heaven in bringing Your Excellency safe unto this part of Your Government.</P>
<P>Particularly that it hath pleased Almighty GOD to incline the Heart of our gracious Sovereign, to Commissionate one of so great and deserving a Character as Your Lordship; and Your Self SIR, in the acceptance thereof, under whose Administration, we promise our selves an impartial managment of Affairs.</P>
<P>More especially considering the late irregular Methods transacted among us; when such only for the most part have been advanced unto Office, whose Fortunes have been desperate, Sacrificing the Publick to a private interest.</P>
<P>No wonder therefore if some Male-contents have represented us to Your Lordship, under the Character of an uneasy and ungovernable People, the contrary of which will soon be evinced by our inviolable Loyalty to His Sacred Majesty, Submissive and hearty Obedience to all Your Excellencies Commands.</P>
<P>Your Excellency's great zeal and integrity in promoting the privi∣ledges of our <HI>English</HI> Nation, and Your steady Conduct in the Go∣vernment of Affairs in the Neighbouring Provinces; together with Your great Prudence exercised since Your Lordships Arrival here; do give a lively prospect of some more than ordinary Blessing to at∣tend us.</P>
<P>Our daily Prayers shall therefore be, that His Majesties Reign may be long and prosperous, that Your Excellency's Government over us may be continued, Your Health increased, and that Heavens Bene∣diction be bestowed on Your Noble Person and Family.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED><HI>By Order, and in behalf of the House of Representatives.</HI> Samuel Penhallow, <HI>Speaker,</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
