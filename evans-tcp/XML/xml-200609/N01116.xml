<HEAD>The Epistle DEDICATORY TO THE Congregation Lately under the PASTORAL CARE Of the <HI>Reverend</HI> Mr. SAMUEL WILLARD.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR FRIENDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>THE Great God,</HI> who is the only <HI>Fountain</HI> of true <HI>Honour,</HI> has imprinted that Majesty and Beauty on true Excellency &amp; Piety, that they command E∣steem and Reverence from all that observe them. And the more Eminent any are in Intellectual or Moral Perfections, the more diffusive in their Goodness; the greater Ho∣nour is due to them when <HI>Living,</HI> &amp; when <HI>Dead.</HI> Such as have been Publick Benefact∣ors to the World by their Worthy Deeds,
<PB REF="001329_0003_0FB27D7089A55088"/>
challenge the most Publick Acknowledge∣ments. And to deny their Memory this just Tribute, will argue an heavy Imputati∣on of Ingratitude and Injustice, both to God and Them. This seems agreeable to the <HI>Natural Notices</HI> of what is Good and Excellent, which are ingraven on the Minds of all men.</P>
<P>Hence the <HI>Very Unletter'd Nations</HI> have had many Contrivances, some odd enough, to Eternize the Memory of their admired <HI>Hero's.</HI></P>
<P>That Part of the <HI>Heathen World,</HI> that has been <HI>better Disciplined,</HI> has always had an Honourable Regard to the Names of their Departed Friends, who either for Wisdom, or Courage, or Vertue, did singularly de∣serve of the Publick. <HI>Funeral Panegyricks</HI> were made to Celebrate their Praise; &amp; the greatest Care was used to transmit their Names with all Marks of Honour to their <HI>Latest Posterity.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The People of God</HI> themselves have in all Ages accounted it a part of Piety, Justice and Charity to pay deserved Respects to the Memory of Great and Good men.</P>
<P><HI>The Jews</HI> were famous for this: They were wont to prepare the Bodies of their Worthy's for their Funeral by Costly Spices,
<PB REF="001329_0004_0FB27D72035CE2B8"/>
Rich Odours and Perfumes. This we have an account of at the Death of <HI>Asa.</HI> 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 16.14. To which Custome possibly the Wise man alludes, when he tells us, <HI>A Good Name is better than precious Oyntment, Eccl.</HI> 7.1. <HI>De∣cent Sepulchres</HI> were provided for their In∣terment; and <HI>Funeral Elegies</HI> made in their Praise. Their Names were not mentioned without a <HI>Blessing on their Memory</HI>: And a∣greeably the <HI>Rabbins</HI> seldome quote any Person of this Figure, but with that Form of Honourable Commemoration, <HI>viz. Such an One of Blessed Memory.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Primitive Christians</HI> accounted it no small part of their Religion, to do Suitable Honour to the Memory of their Deceased Saints, especially <HI>Martyrs,</HI> and faithful <HI>Past∣ors.</HI> They took care that the very Ashes of their Martyrs should not be treated as Com∣mon Dust: They were wont to Enshrine their Remains of Mortality <HI>in Tombs,</HI> &amp; Erect Mo∣numents, on which were Inscribed their Names, Quality and Character. <HI>Funeral O∣rations</HI> were made upon them: And they had Publick Records, called their <HI>Diptychs,</HI> in which their Names were Enrolled with all Circumstances of Honour. And in a lit∣tle time they were prone to pay a Reverence,
<PB REF="001329_0005_0FB27D738173F2C0"/>
<HI>to a fault great,</HI> to the very Dormitorys of those that Slept in Jesus. To be sure in a few Ages they came to pay undue Honour to their Memory; which open'd the way to that <HI>Superstition,</HI> and <HI>Idolatry</HI> in their Invo∣cation, and Worship of Saints, which the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> has been for many Ages Infamous for.</P>
<P>And tho' it becomes us to avoid all that was <HI>Superstitious,</HI> and <HI>faulty</HI> herein practised either by Jew or Gentile, Christian or Infi∣del; yet it seems agreeable to the Light of Reason &amp; Revelation to perpetuate the Me∣mory of our Worthies, and to mention their Names with due Respect. The Wise man tells us, Prov. 10.7. <HI>That the Memory of the Just shall be blessed</HI>; i. e. <HI>shall be praised as some; or shall be with praises, as others read it.</HI> And it is a <HI>Command given,</HI> Heb. 13.7. <HI>Remember them that have the Rule over you, who have spoken to you the Word of God, whose faith follow, considering the end of their Con∣versation. Indeed</HI> a great care is necessary that in all the Praises we give to departed Saints, we ultimately respect the Glory of God, who was the <HI>Giver</HI> of all their Valuable Endowments: Their Worthy Actions must be set forth in a manner suitable, and with a
<PB REF="001329_0006_0FB27D7A72036FB0"/>
just design, to incite the <HI>Living</HI> to an Honou∣rable Imitation of them. And thus there will be no real Inconsistency, but an admira∣ble Harmony, between <HI>Praising the Dead,</HI> &amp; <HI>Instructing the Living.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot therefore but think that I have done but my Duty, what Christianity allows, &amp; In∣vites to, in giving some Account of the Gifts &amp; Graces of that Excellent Person, who was late∣ly Serving God, and the Interest of this Con∣gregation here below; but is now giving his Attendance on the Throne of the Lamb Above: And am perswaded it may be many ways ad∣vantageous, especially to this Flock of Christ; to gratify the desires of many, by a Publication of what of his Character was deliver'd in the following Sermon, in which I have the satis∣faction to have said <HI>Less,</HI> than I am fully per∣swaded, was his <HI>Due.</HI> And sure I am, this short account of this Servant of God may, thro' the Blessing of Heaven, be of considerable Service to us, that have so long Sat under his Shadow, and have had our Souls, if not our own fault, often refreshed with his Dispensations.</P>
<P>The <HI>Great</HI> &amp; <HI>Good</HI> things that are justly spo∣ken of him, should lead us to magnify Christ the <HI>Fountain</HI> from whence all his Accomplish∣ments were derived; and teach us what Hon∣our is due to God in whom all Perfections do Concenter. They tend to inspire us with Gra∣titude
<PB REF="001329_0007_0FB27D7BC3CDE850"/>
to Heaven for the bestowment of so <HI>Rich</HI> a <HI>Blessing</HI> on us, and for the Continuance of the same for so long a season; and so to breathe in∣to us the <HI>Spirit</HI> and <HI>Temper</HI> of Holy <HI>Bernard,</HI> who on the Death of his Brother <HI>Gerard</HI> broke out into that flight:
<Q>Lord, Thou hast given, and Thou hast taken away; tho' we grieve that Thou hast Taken away, yet we cannot forget that Thou didst give him.</Q>
His <HI>Character</HI> may Excite us to a strict Examination of our selves, whether our Im∣provement of so great a Blessing has been pro∣portionable to our advantages, which hereby have been singular; and may lead us to a so∣lemn Consideration of that <HI>Awful Account</HI> we have to give up to God of so <HI>Rich a Price</HI> we have had in our hands; &amp; how Speechless we shall be found if at the last we appear Strangers to <HI>Christ,</HI> and his <HI>Holiness.</HI> It may serve to pro∣mote our Humiliation, and Repentance for our past barrenness under such Manuring, as Hea∣ven has afforded us, by the Care, Wisdom and Fidelity of This his Servant: It may direct our Endeavours after, and Prayers for a <HI>Successor,</HI> that may Enjoy a double Portion of his Gifts and Graces, to fit him to Stand in the Gap that is made in our Hedge. In a word, it may ani∣mate us to a due Imitation of his Holy Exam∣ple, and to a just value for, and holy Improve∣ment of what of his WORKS are left in our Hands, by which tho' DEAD, He yet Speak∣eth aloud to us.</P>
<P><PB REF="001329_0008_0FB27D7D642EF468"/>By his <HI>Printed Works</HI> He has Erected himself a <HI>Monument,</HI> that will Endure when the <HI>Famed</HI> MAUSOLEUM's of the World shall moulder down, and be buryed in their own Ruines. These will render his <HI>Name</HI> a Rich Perfume to such as are acquainted with them, and have a true Relish for Pure and Undefiled Religion. These contain a Rich Treasure of Gospel Truths, which are adapted to advance our Chri∣stian Knowledge and Practice. In Them we have the Depths of Divine Wisdom and Grace, in the Salvation of Sinners discover'd, from its first Design and Projection in the Dayes of E∣ternity, to the Consummation of the Redeem∣eds Blessedness in the Kingdom of Glory, where Hope shall be turned into Fruition, and Faith into Open Vision.</P>

restored.

<P>The <HI>Valuable Treatises,</HI> in which we have these Heavenly Lessons; together with a considerable number of Choice <HI>Sermons</HI> on particular Occa∣sions, are Improvable Talents, which we must Account for before the Judge of the World. And it becomes us to take these, and improve them, as <HI>Elisha</HI> did <HI>Elijah's</HI> Mantle, which dropt from him on his Translation; and see what Won∣ders of Grace, may, thro' the Spirit of Bles∣sing, be done by them on our Hearts.</P>
<P>And, I Trust, the <HI>Relation</HI> I stand in to you will allow me with importunity to press on you, as well as on my own Soul, Some few Words of Counsel and Admonition, which our departed Pastor often inculcated in the Course of his Ministry, &amp; which are worthy to be Writ∣ten on our Souls with Indelible Characters. <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="001329_0011_0FB27D8583625928"/>Let us Labour to lay a good Foundation of <HI>Christian Knowledge,</HI> as the foundation of Practi∣cal Religion. His whole Ministry was wisely fitted to lay this foundation in us; and the want of it in many of his Charge he was wont pathe∣tically to Lament. This Knowledge we must Endeavour to get, and improve in: which is ne∣cessary both to Truth and Growth in Grace. Without it our Affections are but blind Powers: they may be moved, and made Tumultuous, but not well regulated, and all the Impressions made on them will soon be Effaced.</P>
<P>Let us take care that all our <HI>Knowledge</HI> be <HI>Practical.</HI> To this End he open'd the Mysteri∣ous Doctrines of Religion; and set forth Christ in his Mediatorial Al-sufficiency; That we might be Encouraged to Duty by that Provision made for our Assistance, and Acceptance in Obedience.</P>
<P>Let us be Admonished not to Abuse the Doctrine of that <HI>Spiritual Impotence,</HI> which has invaded Humane Nature, to <HI>Sloth</HI> and <HI>Negli∣gence.</HI> He with Sorrow observed in Conversing with Sinners, how they would fly to this as an Excuse for their being Strangers to the Power of Godliness. But we must remember, our Weakness lyes in our Wills, it is chosen &amp; ob∣stinate; and is seen in resisting the Grace which is offered, and which is sufficient for us; and therefore can never Excuse in the Eyes of an Impartial Judge.</P>
<P><PB REF="001329_0012_0FB27D8821A8CE58"/>Let us Use utmost Caution that we do not take up with a <HI>Presumptuous Confidence</HI> for <HI>true Faith.</HI> This is a Rock on which Millions have been dasht to pieces. This Servant of God was frequent in Warning against this, and in assert∣ing the purifying influence of Saving Faith; and that an Unholy Believer was the greatest of Contradictions. Let us see then that our Faith do not separate Christ's Ephod from his Scepter: That it be not a Dead, but a Living Faith; that will purify the heart, work by love, and overcome the World.</P>
<P>Let us be careful how we take our State to be <HI>Regenerate</HI> without <HI>Examination</HI>: Too many it is to be feared, think they were Converted at such a Season, when they were under Legal Terrors, and afterward had some sensible Con∣solation; and they have recourse to this ever after, without trying themselves by their After Lives, which have the black Marks of the Un∣sanctifyed upon them. This cheat we have been often warn'd not to put on our own Souls.</P>
<P>Let us be careful to <HI>Sanctify</HI> the <HI>Sabbath</HI> of God. The Observation of which will have a great influence upon the whole of our Religion, as has been often Inculcated on us.</P>
<P>Let us remember the Solemn Cautions En∣ter'd in the Name of Christ against <HI>Apostacy,</HI> &amp; all approaches to it, either in Principle or Practice.</P>
<P>Let us be careful, in the discharge of the <HI>Du∣ties</HI> of our several <HI>Relations,</HI> to Adorn the Doct∣rine of God our Saviour.</P>
<P><PB REF="001329_0013_0FB27D8EC967E9C8"/>Let us take the Counsels of God, which cal∣led us to <HI>Proficiency</HI> in the School of Christ, to be Stedfast, Immoveable, alwayes Abounding in the Work of the Lord, knowing our La∣bour will not be in vain.</P>
<P><HI>These things,</HI> and many more, which we have Learned, Received, and seen in him, Let us do; and the God of Peace will be with us. The Great Shepherd of the Sheep will feed, lead, and defend this Flock.</P>
<P>In this way we shall Erect for him the most Honourable Monuments in our hearts; &amp; his Memory will be always fresh, and his Name pleasant to us thro' the Dayes of Eternity.</P>
<P><HI>I shall not</HI> add, But that the GREAT LORD and <HI>Head</HI> of the CHURCH may Shower down all Spiritual Blessings on <HI>This Congregation</HI>; That the Kingdom of Christ be here advanced by the Conversion of the Unbelieving, and Improve∣ment of the Believing in Holiness: That you may always Enjoy the Means of Grace, &amp; Di∣vine Influences on them; that your Breach may be well Repaired; that your Houses may be <HI>Be∣thels</HI>; and every Soul a <HI>Living Temple</HI>; &amp; that we may all meet together at last in the HOLY of HOLIES Above, and be FOR EVER with THE LORD.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>Matthew XXIV.45, 46.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Who then is a faithful and wise Servant whom his Lord hath made Ruler over his Hous∣hold, to give them meat in due season?</P>
<P>Blessed is that Servant, whom his Lord when he cometh shall find so doing.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the Conclusion of the former Chapter, our Lord-Redeemer entertains his Dis∣ciples with a <HI>Praediction</HI> of those Deso∣lations, that were coming upon the Jew∣ish Nation; In the final Destruction of their <HI>City</HI> and <HI>Temple,</HI> their <HI>Polity</HI> and <HI>Worship</HI>; in which He would appear in the visible ter∣rors of his Wrath, and the Triumphs of his Pow∣er
<PB N="2" REF="001329_0017_0FB27D9C39E0F888"/>
and Justice: and is therefore stiled his <HI>Com∣ing.</HI> Upon this Praediction his Disciples came to Him as He sat on the Mount of <HI>Olives,</HI> and put two Queries to Him, <HI>viz. When shall these things be?</HI> i. e When will the final Ruin of <HI>Je∣rusalem</HI> Commence? The other Enquiry was, <HI>What shall be the sign of thy Coming, and of the End of the World</HI>? This I understand to be distinct from the former; and to refer to the <HI>Final Judg∣ment.</HI> The reason why the Disciples joyn these two Queries together, may be this, <HI>viz.</HI> They had haply Entertained that Mistake, which prevailed in that day, that the End of the World, or Final Judgment, would either Syn∣chronise with, or immediately follow upon, <HI>Je∣rusalems</HI> Destruction. Our Saviour returns an Answer to both these Questions; which tho' not fitted to gratify their Curiosity, yet was wisely adapted to promote their praeparation for these his Awful Appearances. He particu∣larly acquaints them with some of the infalli∣ble Prognosticks and Fore-runners of his Ap∣pearance in the Clouds of Heaven, to Judge the <HI>Quick</HI> and <HI>Dead.</HI> For I can by no means perswade my self to subscribe the Opinion of some <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Grotius,</HI> Dr. <HI>Hammond.</HI></NOTE> Criticks of no common figure in the Learned World, who look upon the whole of our Saviours Discourse in this Chapter, to look no further than the Destruction of <HI>Jerusa∣lem</HI>: But must think that a great part of this
<PB N="3" REF="001329_0018_0FB27D9E493139C8"/>
Discourse has a principal aspect upon the Fi∣nal Judgment. Now Christ applies the Doct∣rine of this his Personal Appearance to Judge the World, to Engage them to greater diligence and watchfulness, in their preparation to meet Him, when He shall be revealed from Heaven in flaming fire, and with the Retinue of Migh∣ty Angels. This their preparation He further Excites them to, from two Considerations, the <HI>Suddenness</HI> of his Appearance, and the certain <HI>Blessedness</HI> of such as shall be found diligent and faithful in their Masters Work at his Coming▪ The latter of which Arguments is contained in our Text. The words read, tho' in their ge∣neral scope are applicable to all Believers; yet nextly and peculiarly they belong to Christ's Faithful Ministers; who are in an ap∣propriate sense the Servants of his House, the Stewards of his Family, and the Shepherds of his Flock. In them we may observe two prin∣cipal parts.</P>
<P N="1">1. We have the Character of a true Gospel Minister; which is drawn.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) From his Relation to Christ. He is Christ's <HI>Servant,</HI> and Christ is his Lord. And every Gospel Minister is his Servant, not only by the common profession of Christianity, but special designation; by their particular as well as general Calling.</P>

of a Steward in a Family, to assign to eve∣ry Servant his Work and Provision. He has the Care and Order of the other Servants com∣mitted to him. The Church is Christ's own House, the Houshold of Faith; and this must be cared for: fed with the Word and Bread of Life; govern'd &amp; order'd according to Christ's Institutions, who is the Great LORD of the Houshold.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) From those Vertues and Endowments which qualifie him for his Post, and which are to be Exercised in the discharge of the Duties thereof, <HI>viz. Fidelity</HI> and <HI>Wisdom.</HI> He must be a <HI>Faithful</HI> and <HI>Wise</HI> Servant; faithful to keep the charge and trust committed to him; and wise to discharge it in the best manner, so as best to serve the end of it; the Good of Christ's Family, and the Honour of the Great Master of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. We have the reward of that Servant, who is wise and faithful in the Service assigned him. He shall be <HI>Blessed</HI> when his Lord comes; which undoubtedly intends not barely that he shall obtain true blessedness, but an <HI>Eminent degree</HI> thereof, in proportion to his wisdom and fi∣delity.</P>
<P>I shall not Endeavour to grasp all these things into one Doctrine; But shall consider them di∣stinctly in that order in which they have been observed to lie in our Text. So that there are these four things to be considered.</P>

<P N="4">4. The <HI>Distinguishing</HI> Reward, that shall be given unto him, by his Lord at his Coming.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> We are to Consider the Relation that an Evangelical Pastor stands in to Christ: He is the Servant of Christ. The Great Doctor of the Gentiles glories in this Relation, and challenges the acknowledgment of it from others, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.1. <HI>Let a man account of us as the Ministers of Christ, &amp; the Stewards of the Mysteries of God.</HI> The Honour of this Relation belongs not only to the Exalted Station of an Apostle; but to the meanest in the Sacred Function in the Successive Ages of the Church.</P>
<P>It must be acknowledged that there are seve∣ral Wayes in which Men, and other Creatures, may truely come under this Denomination. By <HI>Creation,</HI> all Creatures are his Servants: For He is Lord of Heaven and Earth: He has an unalienable Propriety in, and an absolute Su∣preamacy over all Creatures therein, as they are the Works of his hands. Subjection to his Go∣vernment well becomes the State of the highest Order of Created Beings. The bright Angels.
<PB N="6" REF="001329_0021_0FB27DA3817D4190"/>
of Light, who Excel in Strength, are at his Command, and obey his Will. He stands at the Head of the Lower Creation, and leads forth Creatures Animate, &amp; Inanimate to Serve him, at his Pleasure. The Sun, Moon, and Stars in their Courses; Stormy Wind, Hail, Snow and Vapour, in their places are under his Command, and fulfill his Will. Thus all men as they are the Creatures of God, are his Servants. He spake the Word, and we Started into Being at his Cre∣ating Call: <HI>He made us, and not we our selves; Let us come before the Lord our Maker, and give him the Glory due to his Name.</HI></P>
<P>All professed Christians are his Servants by <HI>External Vocation</HI>; visible <HI>Dedication,</HI> and solemn <HI>Stipulation.</HI> In Baptism we are openly conse∣crated to the Service of the Living JEHOVAH: And did solemnly renounce all other Service, unless in Subordination to Christ: And so we stand obliged to Christ as our Master by our own free Consent and Compact; to which Heaven and Earth are Witnesses.</P>
<P>All Believers are the Servants of Christ by <HI>Redemption,</HI> and the UNCTION of the HOLY ONE. They are not their Own, for they are bought with a price, their Spirits and Bodies are his Propriety. He has formed them for himself; and their Ears are bored to the Posts of his Door. And these are of his Family.</P>
<P>But in a more <HI>Appropriate Sence,</HI> Evangelical Pastors are the Servants of Christ's Family, by a peculiar Separation to Special Service;
<PB N="7" REF="001329_0022_0FB27DAA96DA1900"/>
by which they are distinguished not only from the World, but from the rest of Christs own Houshold. By a special <HI>Deputation</HI> He has Set them over his house; He has given them a Commission to represent his Person, and Prae∣side under him in the great Affairs of his Visible Kingdom, Worship and Service. To be sepa∣rated to the Work of the Gospel is not the pe∣culiar priviledge of an Apostle, but common to every ordinary Gospel Minister. Christ has not left the Work of his House in <HI>Common,</HI> but has drawn a Sacred <HI>Inclosure</HI> about it, to keep out vain pretenders, that would take this Honour to themselves. A <HI>Liberty</HI> of <HI>Prophesying,</HI> as asserted by some, is indeed but a liberty to overturn the Order of the Gospel. All are intruders, and guilty of an Invasion upon the Sacred Office of the Ministry, that have not their <HI>Mission</HI> from Christ. For how shall they Preach unless they be sent? And who shall send them but Christ whose Ambassadors they are? No man taketh this Honour to himself, but he that is Called as was <HI>Aaron.</HI> This authority the Apostles, who were the first Heralds of the Everlasting Gospel, were immediately by Christ invested with: But this is mediately communicated to Christs ordi∣nary Ministers, as their Successors. And these are not <HI>of men,</HI> tho' they are <HI>by men,</HI> by whom they are authorised to dispense the Unsearchable riches of Christ. Their <HI>Message</HI> they receive from Christ, whose Messengers they are. Their
<PB N="8" REF="001329_0023_0FB27DAD23CC8530"/>
solemn <HI>Charge</HI> is given in his Name, and by his Authority they act. Agreeable hereto the El∣ders of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> tho' appointed by an ordinary Call, are said to be made <HI>Overseers</HI> of <HI>the Flock</HI> by <HI>the Holy Ghost,</HI> the Spirit of Christ, <HI>Act.</HI> 20.28. And none but such can Administer the Word and Sacraments with Authority, or a rea∣sonable prospect of Success. The Service that every Gospel Minister is Engaged in has an im∣mediate respect to Christ: He assigns them their Work: Of his Revenue they are Maintained; and to him they must finally give up an account. Thus in a peculiar sence they are the Ministers of Christ; and only the Servants of their People for Christs sake. They are the <HI>Stewards</HI> of his Houshold; <HI>Labourers</HI> in his Vineyard &amp; Harvest; Whose Province is to Sow, Plant, Cultivate and Manure the Soil of the Church, that Garden of Christ. And this their Relation to Christ tells us that their <HI>Station</HI> is high and honourable; their <HI>Charge</HI> most important; and their <HI>Account</HI> awful: That to contemn, insult, and outrage their Character, will be interpreted as an insuf∣ferable Indignity offer'd to Christ himself; and that their <HI>Master will highly resent it as such.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> In the Second place we are to Consider the <HI>Work</HI> of Gospel Ministers. The relation of Servants necessarily infers Work, and Service for their Lord. And the special Service, which they are called to, is to <HI>Feed, Rule</HI> and <HI>Order Christs Fa∣mily.</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="001329_0024_0FB27DAE0D6F9EF8"/>
They are <HI>Rulers</HI> over his <HI>Houshold</HI> to give them their <HI>Meat</HI> in due Season. How honoura∣ble is their Work! How difficult their Post, and the Service thereof! The dignity of their Sta∣tion and Employment would well become the Excellency, and its difficulty requires the power, purity, and activity of the Highest Angels, that incircle the Throne of God. Their Work con∣sists of two parts, and we may Consider them distinctly.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Work of an Evangelical Minister is to <HI>Feed Christ's Family.</HI> Christ's Flock must be fed, and his Houshold must have suitable Pro∣vision made for them. And this by Office be∣longs to Christ's Servants, to whom he has com∣mitted the Word of Reconciliation. These are under the most Solemn Obligations, and awful charge to take care of this; as they would not be found Idle Shepherds, Slothful Servants, and Unfaithful Stewards, by their Lord <HI>at His Coming</HI>; and be Animadverted on as such. What Christ pathetically inculcates upon <HI>Peter,</HI> has a respect to all the Messengers of Peace, <HI>John</HI> 21.15, 16, 17. Simon Son of Jonas lovest thou me more than these? — <HI>Feed my Lambs— Feed my Sheep— Feed my Sheep.</HI> The same address He makes to every Pastor with the like Expressions of En∣dearment. This therefore is a principal, and essential part of their Office Work, to give the other Servants of God's Family their Food.</P>
<P>This Food must be Spiritual: Such a Provi∣sion
<PB N="10" REF="001329_0025_0FB27DB02409C4E0"/>
as may be a proper Entertainment for the Soul: as may be suited to the Nature, Necessi∣ties, Spiritual Appetite, and Cravings of an Im∣mortal Spirit, As bodily Food does answer the wants of the Body. Proper Food is <HI>Pabulum Vitae.</HI> It is necessary to the preservation, growth and nourishment of the outward man: It is suita∣ble in its nature and design, to confirm and en∣crease the strength and health of the Body: To repair the decayes of Nature, and maintain it in a due Temperature and disposition to dis∣charge the proper functions of life. Now in <HI>Analogy</HI> to this: Spiritual Food is whatever tends to beget, maintain and improve the true spiritual life of man. To nourish the Soul with Divine Knowledge, which is the proper food of the Understanding; to beget and strength∣en, to encrease and nourish the Divine Princi∣ples of Grace and Vertue in the heart; to ad∣vance the Soul from one degree of Vertue to another; from it's Infant to a more virile State; To restore it from it's decayes and spi∣ritual languishments to an athletick and healthy Condition; This is to afford it suitable food. And this is the business of the Stewards of Gospel Mysteries. Christ sends his Servants on this very Errand to open blind eyes, to soften hard Hearts, to awaken secure Consciences, and Edify the Body of Christ. And to feed Christ's Flock is to instruct their ignorance, in∣lighten their darkness, to nourish them with
<PB N="11" REF="001329_0026_0FB27DB15112BE28"/>
spiritual wisdom and vertue; to use proper methods to render their knowledge productive of an Heavenly Conversation, and to turn the principles of Truth into living principles of Action: It is to heal the wounded spirit, to com∣fort the Disconsolate, to raise up the Dejected, to encourage the Fearful, confirm the Waver∣ing, reduce the Straying, to spur up the Loyte∣ring, and strengthen the Weak, that they may advance to higher degrees of the Divine Na∣ture and Life. The Servants of Christ cannot indeed by any vertue of their own, or by the proper force of their Dispensations convey life and strength to the Soul: <HI>Paul may plant, and Apollos water, but God gives the increase</HI>: He bles∣ses Zion's <HI>Provision,</HI> and cloaths her <HI>Priests</HI> with Salvation. They therefore are said to feed Christ's Family, when they use the Means Or∣dained for their Spiritual Nourishment. Now there are several Duties, in the discharge where∣of, this food and nourishment is to be afforded to a People.</P>
<P>To this end the Word of Truth must be dis∣pensed, and applyed. In which the mysterious methods of <HI>Divine Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Grace</HI> must be display'd, and unfolded: By this the knowledge of God and Christ is to be propagated, whom to know is Life Eternal. The <HI>Preaching of the Gospel</HI> is a wise and condescending method in which Christ is pleased to carry on a Treaty of Peace with Rebel Sinners. It is a proper
<PB N="12" REF="001329_0027_0FB27DB8373ADAE0"/>
Remedy for the spiritual ignorance and blind∣ness, the forgetfulness and inconsiderateness of men. It is admirably adapted to rouze the se∣cure and stupid out of their Spiritual Lethargy; to convince them of their sin and misery; to turn them from the Error of their wayes, and transform them into the Image of Divine Purity. It is fitted to build up Saints in Faith, Holiness and Comfort. Agreeably we have this Enco∣mium given of this Word of Grace, the Dis∣pensation whereof is committed to the Gospel Ministry: 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.15, 16. It is able to make Wise to Salvation: <HI>It is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Instruction in Righteousness.</HI> This is the <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 4.15.</NOTE> good Seed by which Sinners are begotten, and translated into the Kingdom of Light and Grace. By this Saints are <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. 2.2▪</NOTE> nou∣rished, and made to thrive in all the dispositions of Holiness. In this the Wells of Salvation are open'd, whence the disconsolate may draw Wa∣ter with Joy. And in the right dispensation of this the Servants of Christ are helpers of the Believers Joy <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 1.24.</NOTE>. This Word they are oblig'd to dispense as they have Opportunity in their Private Applications to their People; and in the Publick Service of Gods house.</P>
<P>Again, they are to Feed the Houshold of Christ by a due Administration of the <HI>Seals</HI> of
<PB N="13" REF="001329_0028_0FB27DBA203214A8"/>
the <HI>Covenant,</HI> the <HI>Sacraments</HI> of BAPTISM and the LORD's SUPPER.</P>
<P>They are Authorized to <HI>Baptize: Mat.</HI> 28.19. By <HI>Baptism</HI> they Enroll Souls in the Number of Christs Servants, and acknowledge them as the visible Subjects of his Kingdom. Hereby they bring them under the Wings and Bonds of the Covenant; under the Care and Government of Gods Family; and intitule them to the provisi∣on of his Domesticks.</P>
<P>By a due Administration also of the <HI>Sacrament</HI> of the <HI>Lords Supper</HI> these Shepherds are to Feed the <HI>Flock</HI> of Christ. Herein Christ himself is set forth as the proper <HI>Food</HI> of Souls. <HI>His Flesh is Meat indeed, &amp; his Blood is Drink indeed</HI>; &amp; these are here under the sensible and lively Symbols of Bread &amp; Wine, Exhibited for the nourishment of Grace. Christ's Ministers are to prepare their People for this Spiritual Banquet; lead them to it, that there they may be Royally Entertained with the Hea∣venly Manna, the Bread of Angels; which tho' not suited to the Gust of a Carnal Appetite; yet affords Superiour Satisfaction to the Spiritu∣al Senses of the Divine Nature in the renew'd; and it is Wisely designed by it's Author to Main∣tain, Strengthen, and Perfect the Divine Life. And hereby we are to be sustained in our pas∣sage thro' this Wilderness, till we shall arrive safe at the good Land of Promise.</P>
<P>Again, Ministers must feed their People by
<PB N="14" REF="001329_0029_0FB27DBB82B40828"/>
their <HI>Prayers,</HI> both <HI>Publick</HI> and <HI>Private.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Minister will do more good, sayes <HI>Austin, Pietate Orationis, quam facultate dicendi.</HI></NOTE> By their private and secret <HI>addresses</HI> to God for their Charge, and the success of their work. For this they must daily bend their Knees before the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and in an holy agony, wrestle with God to obtain the best of Blessings for themselves, and for their Flock.</P>
<P><HI>Jacob's</HI> Ladder on which Angels were seen to ascend and descend, is thought to be a lively Emblem of a Gospel Minister; who is first to ascend to Heaven in holy Meditation &amp; Pray∣er; and then to descend in holy Dispensations to his people. In this way they are to storm Heaven, and with holy violence wrest down the Blessing; give God no Rest till he comes and breathes his Holy Spirit upon them.</P>
<P>Ministers are also to nourish their People by their <HI>Publick Prayers.</HI> But then they must see that they be proper for nourishment: Not dark, mysterious, and unintelligible discourses; but proper addresses to Heaven, suitable to the Ma∣jesty, and Purity of the Presence they approach; and the state, wants and circumstances of Im∣mortal Souls, whose Case they are to carry be∣fore the Throne of Grace. Their Prayers must not be <HI>Doctrinal,</HI> but <HI>Devotional</HI>: Thus there must be a care that they do not give their people
<PB N="15" REF="001329_0030_0FB27DBE2092C690"/>
<HI>Stones</HI> instead of <HI>Bread.</HI> And by these well or∣der'd Prayers, they will afford true food to Souls. And not only as these Prayers are Means Sanctify'd, and approved to procure the Dews of Divine Grace: But also as they have a natural tendency to refresh and cherish the Souls of Gods People. These have a proper aptitude to inkindle Divine Breathings in their hearts; to inspire them with the true spirit of Devotion, to refine and purifie their carnal af∣fections, to help them to some spiritual views of the beauty and excellency of Christ, and thereby to cherish the vital flame of Grace, and make it burn with greater heat and light. The experience of the Faithful will set a seal to this; that their hearts have been many times by the Prayers of their Pastors, rapt up to Heaven in Holy ardours, dissolved in love; their Souls pleased, and profited to no common degree.</P>
<P>In fine, they are to feed them by their <HI>Good Example.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Copia Operum Egregia Copia fandi.
<BIBL><HI>Austin.</HI></BIBL></NOTE> They are under the awe of a strict Command from their Lord, to be Examples to the Flock; In <HI>Word,</HI> in <HI>Conversation,</HI> in <HI>Charity,</HI> in <HI>Spi∣rit,</HI> in <HI>Faith,</HI> in <HI>Purity,</HI> 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.12. The want of this in Ministers has a fatal tendency to destroy Souls; to harden the prophane and dissolute, to make them think all Religion to be no bet∣ter then a cheat and fiction; and it tends to
<PB N="16" REF="001329_0031_0FB27DC3C41F63B0"/>
make the more serious to stumble, and despise the Altar of the Lord. The wicked Lives of such will read loud Lectures of Atheism and Irreligion; while in their Discourses they talk like Angels of Light. And many will give more credit to the Life they live, than to the Doctrine they Preach. Their good Example will be many ways beneficial: This will inform others in their duty, in their spiritual danger, and proper remedy: and Examples are the most easie and compendious way of Instruction: This will afford motive and incentive to en∣courage and inflame persons to press forward in the Service of God, and pursuit of the Heaven∣ly Prize. Hence it is given as the property of the good Shepherd, <HI>that He goes before the Sheep. Joh.</HI> 10.4. They must labour to go before them in all parts of the Christian Life, and thereby recommend it to their choice and practice, they must be, as far as may be, instances of the comforts and joyes of Religion. Thus they are in all things to imitate the Great Shepherd of the Sheep; and this will be a Noble and Di∣vine way of feeding the Flock of Christ. These are the several ways in which the Servants of Christ are to feed his Houshold; and if they neglect it, they must do it at their <HI>Utmost Peril,</HI> and know they must answer for it at the <HI>Grand Visitation</HI> of the <HI>Great Shepherd</HI> and <HI>Bishop of Souls,</HI> which is expected.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="17" REF="001329_0032_0FB27DC542AFBE80"/>2. We must consider the other part of their work: Which is to <HI>Rule, Inspect</HI> and <HI>Order</HI> the <HI>Houshold.</HI> As the Church is a Society distinct from the World, so it must be under a distinct Polity. A Government suitable to it's Nature, Constitution, &amp; End, was undoubtedly appoint∣ed for it. A Society without Government will be but an Ephesian Rout. There can be no Unity or Harmony between the parts of a Body Politick, if all its Members are in a State of <HI>E∣quality,</HI> and of the same <HI>Use</HI> &amp; <HI>Service</HI>; But Con∣fusion &amp; Disorder will devour all that is good &amp; beautiful without a Miraculous Interposition of Heaven. And this can on no terms be allow'd to be the State of the Church; that <HI>House</HI> and <HI>Temple</HI> of the <HI>Living God;</HI> who is a God not of <HI>Confusion</HI> but of <HI>Order.</HI> Now this Government lyes prima∣rily upon the Shoulders of the Lord Jesus Christ; who is <HI>King of Zion,</HI> and Head of his Church. By his governing Providence he preserves and defends it against all the assaults of the combined force and malice of Earth &amp; Hell. He has fixed it on a Rock, and the Gates of Hell shall never move it. By the Secret Power of his Word, and the unconquerable influence of his Spirit He rules in the Hearts of his People. And as the Great Law-giver of his Church. He has or∣dained <HI>Laws, Orders, Ordinances, Sacraments</HI> and <HI>Censures.</HI> All which are appointed for the due regulation of this Special Society. He does not Administer these in his own Person, for He is long

since with drawn as to Bodily Presence from his Militant Flock; and appears at the head of his Triumphant People in Glory: And has ap∣pointed Officers, who, during his absence, are to act in his Name, and to see that his Laws, and Orders, made for the Government of his Visible Kingdom, be observed and executed; and the charge of these is committed to the Evangelical Pastors. I shall not here dispute who are the <HI>First Recipients</HI> of the <HI>Keyes</HI> of Christ's Kingdom. Thus much seems evident beyond contradiction, that it belongs to the Ministers by <HI>Office</HI> to Exert this Power; that by their hands the <HI>Keyes</HI> are to be turned both in <HI>Opening</HI> and <HI>Shutting</HI> the Kingdom of Heaven; that they act herein under Christ, by a power derived from him, what subordinate Helps to them, or what concurrence soever of others with them, in the Exercise of this power, may be thought requisite. The Pastor is therefore in our Text styled a Ruler over Christ's Houshold: And submission to Spi∣ritual Guides as such, is an indispensible duty. Heb. 13.17. <HI>Obey them that Rule over you in the Lord; who watch for Souls, as those that must give an account.</HI> Their Power is not <HI>Secular</HI> but <HI>Spi∣ritual.</HI> The Rods, Axes and Swords of Civil Government, are not the <HI>Instruments</HI> of their <HI>Government.</HI> Their <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 10.4.</NOTE> Weapons are not <HI>Carnal,</HI>

but <HI>Spiritual;</HI> yet mighty thro' God to dismantle the <HI>Strong holds</HI> of the Kingdom of Darkness.

<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> We must consider those <HI>Vertues</HI> and <HI>Endowments</HI> which qualifie Ministers for their Station and Work, and are to be exercised in the discharge of the duties of it.

Now this Fide∣lity obliges, and disposes to the observation of such Rules as these, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Fidelity</HI> obliges the Gospel Minister to make the <HI>Honour of Christ,</HI> and the <HI>good of Souls,</HI> the <HI>governing design</HI> of his Ministry: The End is the Rule to direct our judgment and choice of means: A corrupt design in Spiritual Guides will corrupt their whole Ministry; For that will be correspondent to that which is their primary intention, and last design in their work. If a Minister be under the governing influence of a worldly or ambitious spirit, all his admi∣nistrations will, in probability, be suited to the depraved inclinations of that evil spirit: This will prophane his most solemn and sacred performances. There will be infinite hazard that his Doctrine, his Conversation, and Dis∣cipline be all prostituted to base selfish designs; and that the whole of his Ministerial Dispen∣sations be calculated to the Meridian of Ho∣nour or Gain; which he makes his ruling In∣terests.
<PB N="21" REF="001329_0036_0FB27DD085F6DB00"/>
If it will serve this worldly design, he will appear like an Angel of Light, all flame and zeal in the Cause of God; he will speak like an Apostle with <HI>Fiery Tongues,</HI> as if he had been filled with the Holy Ghost: But if a∣nother scene be open'd; and he perceive that zeal for the purity of Gospel Truth, for the chastity of Divine Worship, and beauty of Holiness, will not advance, but contradict his carnal designs; no wonder if we should see his zeal chill'd, and a time-serving indifferency take its place, and his courage wholly Exstin∣guished by a pretended Discretion. There will be great danger that such will disguise Truth, varnish over Error, and rebate the edge of the Word, that <HI>Sword</HI> of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> lest presumptu∣ous haughty Sinners be too deeply wounded. There is nothing tends more to corrupt the Fidelity of Ministers, than false ends; for this will be a false byass to disorder them in their whole Walk: Hence they are solemnly charged to take the oversight of Christ's Flock, not for <HI>Filthy lucre:</HI> 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 5.3.

For all seek their own, and not the things that are Jesus Christs.</HI> Christ's Servants if faithful, must be inspired with purity of in∣tention in their Dispensation of the Means of Grace: They must imitate the good example of the ancient Stewards of the Mysteries of God; who could say, as 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.5. <HI>We preach not our selves,</HI> but <HI>Jesus Christ the Lord,</HI> and <HI>our selves</HI> your <HI>Servants for Christs sake.</HI> Thus Fi∣delity requires that they have the Honour of God, and the Eternal Salvation of Souls, al∣ways in their <HI>Last View</HI>; and then all their En∣deavours will be levelled to promote these bles∣sed designs: and this will not permit them to debase their <HI>Heavenly Calling</HI> to mean, earthly de∣signs.

Thus with the Flames of Zeal and Love, and with the strength of unbroken resolution, they must prosecute their Masters Work; that they may

save Sinners from Death, enlarge the Kingdom, and extend the Empire of Christ over the lost Rebel Sons of <HI>Adam.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Fidelity</HI> requires the Servants of Christ to furnish their own minds with a suitable mea∣sure of Divine Knowledge. <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Mal. 2.7.</NOTE> <HI>The Priests lips are to preserve knowledge,</HI> and we <HI>must ask the law at his mouth.</HI> Ministers are appointed Guides to direct lost Souls to Glory: but if the blind lead the blind, the issue will be unsafe; they may both expect to fall into the pit of Everlasting Dark∣ness. An Ignorant Minister cannot be faith∣ful: A Sun without Light, is not a greater So∣laecism, than such an one: He must know every part of his duty, otherwise He can∣not do it faithfully. Evangelical Pastors are to be <HI>Ready Scribes,</HI> well instructed for the King∣dom of Heaven; they are to be like the good <HI>Housholder</HI> that brings out of his treasure things new and old. <HI>Mat.</HI> 13.52. It is not a small de∣gree of knowledge that will be sufficient to quality a person for the faithful discharge of the Ministerial Office. There must be a consi∣derable acquaintance with the Learned Tongues, and Liberal Arts, which are subservient to Di∣vinity: And a good Divine will make it his great care to transfer the spoils of other Arts, to the Service of the Temple. It was a Bar∣barous Age when there was reason of that com∣plaint,
<PB N="24" REF="001329_0039_0FB27DD8064BE0A0"/>
<HI>viz. Graece nosse suspectum Erat, Hebrai<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e prope Haereticum</HI>; and such ignorance will make it a dark Day with the Church of God: It will be cover'd with Clouds of Error &amp; Ignorance. It was a Comprehensive Petition which was once made by a Grave Divine, when taking his farewell, for his bereav'd Flock, <HI>viz.</HI> That God would not leave them under the influence of a <HI>Dark Lanthorn,</HI> nor yet under the false light of an <HI>Erratick Fire;</HI> which would bewilder them in the by-paths of simplicity. Ministerial Fi∣delity will engage persons to use utmost care to be neither of these; that the light they give may not be <HI>faint</HI> thro' want of due knowledge, nor <HI>false</HI> thro' Error.</P>
<P>This Knowledge must be attained in an ordinary way, by much Study, Meditation and Prayer: For we are not born with it: Nor in this Age can we expect to be qualify'd for this Work by a Miraculous <HI>Descent</HI> of the HOLY GHOST in Tongues of fire, which was the priviledge of the Apostles on the Day of <HI>Pentecost.</HI> We may not without daring presumption depend on <HI>Extraordinary Visions,</HI> nor <HI>Immediate Inspiration;</HI> but on the blessing of God on our Endeavours. This Faithfulness must govern us in our Study, as well as in the Pulpit. And the care any take to accomplish themselves with knowledge to an uncommon degree, is to be esteemed true fidelity to those under their Pastoral Care;
<PB N="25" REF="001329_0040_0FB27DD98AD66230"/>
whose Service they are thus preparing them∣selves for. All Ministers should labour to de∣serve the Character of <HI>Apollos,</HI> a man <HI>Eloquent,</HI> and <HI>mighty</HI> in the Scriptures: They should fear to run like <HI>Ahimaaz,</HI> on a Message, without suitable tidings to carry to a people. They that are faithful will dread that Charge, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.7. <HI>who are desirous to be teachers of others, un∣derstanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Fidelity</HI> requires that they keep not back any part of the <HI>Counsel of God</HI> from their Flock. A Steward cannot be faithful, if he with-hold any part of that portion, which belongs to the Servants of the Family: What Christ has ap∣pointed for them, they must give them in due season. The Holy Scriptures are a Sacred Re∣pository of Divine Truths; they are compre∣hensive of all Articles of Faith, and Rules of Duty; and these must be open'd. The Truth as it is in JESUS, is perfective of the Understand∣ing in Divine Knowledge, and Directive of the Christians practice: And no essential part of this can be concealed, without the guilt of <HI>Sa∣criledge</HI> to God, and <HI>Injustice</HI> to the Souls of men; and both will infer unfaithfulness. The great design of Divine Revelation, is to retrieve Sinners from their state of sin and misery, and advance them to a state of Holiness, and compleat Blessedness: The whole Counsel of God is of Service to carry on this design of Grace.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="001329_0041_0FB27DDB0F830220"/>It is to this end requisite that men be informed what was that state of Honour, Ho∣liness and Perfection, in which Man was at first Created; How he was placed at the Head of the Visible Creation as Lord of the Lower World; How bright with the Beauty of Holi∣ness, and Glory of the Divine Image, and what happiness he stood a Candidate for. They must be acquainted how this glorious <HI>Son</HI> of the <HI>Morning</HI> is fallen, his pomp and glory laid in the dust: How he revolted from God as his Sovereign Lord, and Supream Good; and put himself under a foreign Jurisdiction: What per∣manent Depravation and disorder in all his po∣wers is contracted; What impotency has inva∣ded his Nature, and what Treasures of Divine Wrath he is become Heir of; How the Infect∣ion and Pollution, together with the guilt of the first transgression is intailed as a cursed In∣heritance upon all the Progeny of Apostate man.</P>
<P>They must be instructed in the blessed design of God to raise up, out of the corrupt mass, &amp; rubbish of the Apostacy, some Glorious Monu∣ments to illustrate the Honour of Sovereign Grace: The method in which this great affair was carried on to success, according to the In∣fallible Counsel of God: The Scheme of A∣postate mans Recovery, which was projected, and methodized by Unerring Wisdom; How all the Divine Attributes herein meet in an adorable Harmony, and have a favourable aspect upon

There must be a discovery how the <HI>Three Persons</HI> in the GODHEAD do concur in this Design; and what part of mans Salvation is in the Word of God assigned to the distinct Agency of each Person. Ministerial Fidelity requires a Decla∣ration of the nature of man's Redemption, the method in which it was impe<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rated, and must be apply'd. To this end Sinners must be infor∣med in the Doctrine of Christ's Person, who was true God, and real man; In the Doctrine of his Offices; in the truth, necessity and per∣fection of his Satisfaction, and the prevalency of his Intercession; In the extent and power of his Government; in the light and wisdom of his Instructions. To this end they must be in∣structed in the Doctrine of the Person and Of∣fice of the Blessed Spirit: In the nature and necessity of Regeneration, without which there can be no application of Redemption to Cap∣tive man.</P>
<P>The tenour of the Covenant of Reconcilia∣tion must be laid open; the duties it enjoins, the demands it makes of Sinners, the Blessings it offers; and the inseparable connexion be∣tween the duties and promises of this Covenant must be declared: And the nature, design and import of the Seals of the Covenant, Baptism, and the Lords-Supper, must be unfolded.</P>
<P><HI>In fine,</HI> The Servants of Christ must labour
<PB N="28" REF="001329_0043_0FB27DE502CAD030"/>
to give Sinners a true view of the <HI>UNSEEN WORLD</HI>: They must set before them Future Misery in its Reality, Extremity, and Intermi∣nable Duration: And Future Blessedness in its Fullness and Certainty, Excellency and Eter∣nity. Thus Fidelity requires that Articles of Faith, and Rules of Life, Promises and Threat∣nings, be dispensed according to Divine Reve∣lation: And this gave the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> bold∣ness in making his Appeal to those that had been under his Tuition, and to take his Leave of them with this solemn address. <HI>Ye know—How I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you; wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am</HI> PURE <HI>from the</HI> BLOOD <HI>of all men; for I have not shunned to declare unto you all the</HI> COUNSEL <HI>of God,</HI> Acts 20.20. and 26, 27.</P>

First to form a <HI>Module</HI> of Notions in their own heads, and then to strain Scripture to approve their <HI>preconceiv'd Schemes,</HI> to torture it to confess truths it is a stranger to; this is every way unworthy the Character of a Gospel Minister, and is most prejudicial to the Sacred Interest of the Gospel: Fidelity commands here a Caution; how else can they come with a, <HI>THUS SAITH THE LORD.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. It requires that they Employ all their <HI>Ta∣lents</HI> in this Work. Our great Lord has distribu∣ted his Talents among his Servants with an admi∣rable variety according to his Sovereign pleasure: and none has reason of just Complaint; for he is Lord of his own, and is a debtor to no man. <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 12.7.</NOTE> There are Diversities of Gifts, tho' the same Spirit.

All the <HI>Stars</HI> that appear in the Firmament of the Church, are not of equal <HI>Magnitude,</HI> nor do they shine with equal brightness. There is a vast difference as to the Opportunities of Exercising these different En∣dowments, which arises from their several Sta∣tions, or parts of the Vineyard they are Set to labour in. There is a great difference also as to their Name, and repute in the World, and con∣sequently, as to their Interest, Influence, and Authority over others. Now all these are im∣proveable in their Masters Service, which they are to Occupy for his Honour, till He come▪ And they cannot be Faithful if they do not im∣prove all these, in their just proportion, to the advancement of the great Work they are En∣gaged in. For to <HI>whom</HI> God has <HI>given much, He requires the more.</HI> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Luke 12.48.</NOTE> God expects a proportion between mens Receipts and Returns. Hence it is not sufficient for one Servant to say, he does as much as some others, who are undoubtedly faithful, whereas he ought to do more Service than they, who have not equal Ability and Op∣portunity.

None of their Talents are to lye by without improve∣ment; none must be imbezled, or misplaced upon other things, neither upon affairs of State, nor Trade. For tho' men may not be able to charge them with neglect of their duty, yet they will fall under the charge of Christ, who has given them their Abilities.</P>
<P>All the Talents committed to the Ministers of Christ are consecrated to the Service of Christ in his Church: and what is it less than <HI>Sacriledge</HI> to alienate them?

to Persons of differing Characters, there may, &amp; many times ought to be a Difference, but not as to the <HI>Matter.</HI> The High &amp; Low, the Master and Servant have one and the same Rule of Life: They must enter the same Strait Gate, and walk in the same Narrow Way, if ever they arrive safe at the Port of Blessedness. The Gospel has not made that Sin in the Poor, which is not (<HI>Caeteris Paribus</HI>) in the Rich. All Souls are of equal price in the Sight of Christ, and ought to be so in ours.

<P N="7">7. It requires <HI>Unwearied Application,</HI> and <HI>Un∣stinting Resolution</HI> in the Discharge of the duties of their Post. The Honour of their Lord, the Excellency of Immortal Souls, that are in the last hazard of Eternal Perdition, the solemn Charge they are under, and the strict account they must live in expectation of, do demand, and are pressing arguments to move them to the greatest watchfulness, diligence and con∣stancy in their work. The necessities of their Flock do importune and challenge this of them. Without this application they can have no good prospect that their work will be crowned with success; but have reason to fear lest their la∣bour should be under the blast of Heaven. Sloth and negligence is inconsistent with Fidelity. To do the work of the Lord <HI>Negligently,</HI> is to do it <HI>Deceitfully</HI>; and such as are thus guilty, will never fullfil their Ministry.

<PB N="35" REF="001329_0050_0FB27DFA48B19600"/>
World and Devil are joyned in a cursed Con∣cert to ruine their work, and to deface all good impressions that at any time are made upon the hearts of their People: And their diligence is equal to their policy and malignity in counter-working Christ's Labourers. Worldly cares and carnal pleasures easily divert the thoughts of the awakened Soul, and so damp and stifle the Convictions, with great difficulty and labour wrought within them: Satan like a <HI>Bird</HI> of <HI>Prey</HI> watches the seed of the Word as soon as sown, and picks it up, that it may not take root; and is ready to sow tares in the room of good Seed. The greatest diligence and watchful∣ness is necessary to prevent his ill designs. By sloth and negligence there is advantage given to the Evil One: while the Labourer <HI>slept, the Enemy soweth Tares,</HI> Mat. 13.25. When a Holy Spark is struck into the Soul, either by publick or private addresses; and seems to have taken hold, how soon is it quenched? Good resolu∣tions are easily dampt; devout desires and af∣fections chill'd; and the Heart that seem'd to melt and flow at the Presence of God in an Or∣dinance, is often by the next Ordinance grown as hard as the adamant: And thus the work of Christ's Ministers is often undone, nay, goes backward, rather than forward. And what re∣solution and pains are enough to withstand and vanquish this opposition, and carry on the de∣sired work to success? Sure we may be, that
<PB N="36" REF="001329_0051_0FB27DFC34D27DD0"/>
the work is like to be left undone, unless God's Servants are patient, unwearied, &amp; faint not in their labours. Hence the Apostle with the greatest solemnity, and authority lays this charge upon them, 2 Tim. 4.1, 2. <HI>I charge thee before the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the Quick and Dead at his Appearance and Kingdom, Preach the Word, be instant in season, and out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine.</HI> This diligence and application must be exerci∣sed in their preparations for their publick Dis∣pensations; without which they can't well expect to prosper. It was an awful word spoken <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>She∣pard Camb.</HI></NOTE> by an Excellent Per∣son, whose praise has been thro' out these Churches: <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q>;God will curse that mans Labours, who lumbers up and down in the World all the week; and then on Satur∣day afternoon goes to his Study.</Q></P>
<P>There must be also the Exercise of an inde∣fatigable Spirit in all their applications to their Flock, if they would maintain their Fidelity. They must give way to no discouragements. Want of success and reproach, hopes and fears must not move them from their duty. No pre∣sent Evil, or Advantage must prevail upon them to stand still, and see the Truths of the Gospel undermined, or adulterated; but must coura∣giously make head against the most popular Errors, and common Immoralities, in the face of the greatest outward danger. Truths must
<PB N="37" REF="001329_0052_0FB27DFD8A08C578"/>
not be concealed, nor the strictness of Gospel precept relaxed to gain the favour of men, of what figure soever; for thus their trust would be betrayed. The Temper and Resolution of the Apostle will well become every Servant in Christ's Family. Acts 20.<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>4. <HI>None of these things move me, neither count I my life dear to my self, so that I may finish my Course with joy, and the Mini∣stry that I have received of the Lord Jesus.</HI> This Resolution and Application to their work is necessary, that they may stand before Christ's Tribunal <HI>Pure</HI> from the <HI>Blood</HI> of <HI>Souls.</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>Prudence</HI> is another Vertue that is a ne∣cessary qualification of the Stewards over Christ's Houshold, which must be exercised in the dis∣charge of every part of their Function. They must be <HI>Wise,</HI> as well as <HI>Faithful</HI>: This is a per∣fection, by which we not only consider and judge aright of things in their general nature, and understand Truth and Error, Vertue and Vice; but also it enables to take a view of things in their various circumstances, and to form a right judgment of particular cases, and well to determine what is most fit, proper, and expe∣dient to be done in that variety of Cases, which are to be expected when we come to practice. When the right end is fixed, Wisdom directs in the choice of those means that are best adapted to attain the design: And agreeably, <NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>Aquinas.</HI></NOTE> the

There are vile arts of insinuation, which suit well enough the Character of the Emissaries of Hell, who are cunning to deceive; which must not be accounted any part of the Character of the Ministers of Truth, who must be <HI>wise to win Souls.</HI> They must not only consider what is duty, but also in what <HI>method</HI> this may be done to the greatest success. Prudence includes great <HI>Praecaution</HI> to obviate difficulties, and evils that may threaten their work with unsuccess∣fulness; and <HI>Sagacity</HI> to espy and improve all advantages to carry on their laudable designs. It is impossible for me fully to set forth this vertue in its nature, excellency and power; or in that influence it ought to have upon this <HI>Sacred Order</HI> of men, in their faithful discharge of the duties of their Place. I shall only hint
<PB N="39" REF="001329_0054_0FB27E009490B5A0"/>
at a few <HI>Cardinal points,</HI> to which Ministerial Prudence must always have respect, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Ministerial Wisdom</HI> must be Exercised in a suitable Care and Caution not to <HI>Expose</HI> their <HI>Character</HI> to Contempt. There is a just <HI>Reverence</HI> due to the Character of God's Ambassadors, which cannot be lost without Evident dammage to their Masters Service. Few People are so <HI>Metaphysical</HI> as to abstract the <HI>Calling</HI> from the <HI>Person:</HI> to contemn the Person of a Minister &amp; yet reverence his Office. It must be allowed therefore as a standing Maxim of Wisdom, that Ministers must be careful to Maintain that Re∣verence, which is due to them for their Work sake. Indeed many times Vile and Profligate men will load them with contempt tho they are never so circumspect: Their very Character is enough to Expose them to the scorn and banter of some, whose Vices have sunk them below the vilest parts of the Creation, who are lost to all sense of what is virtuous, good and sacred▪ But they must be careful not to deserve such rude treatment. That by their foolish anguard∣ed Conversation, they do not invite the Profane to ridicule and insult them. And it must be ac∣knowledged that they are the Criminal Occa∣sions too often of that Contempt and Indignity which is cast on them. Hence we have that ad∣vice given to <HI>Titus,</HI> and to every Minister in him, Tit. 2.15. <HI>Let no man despise thee.</HI> Which Pre∣cept must be observed by avoiding every thing
<PB N="40" REF="001329_0055_0FB27E0218A5FF60"/>
that will make them appear <HI>Vile, Mean</HI> &amp; <HI>Little</HI> in the eye of the World. And this Prudence is to be seen in.</P>
<P>To this End Prudence directs and requires Ministers to avoid <HI>Vice</HI> and <HI>Immorality.</HI> For this will wound the best Reputation, and Expose to Contempt. And renders these Servants of God in a peculiar manner <HI>Vile.</HI> Thus <HI>Eli</HI>'s Sons ren∣dred themselves <HI>Vile.</HI> This will darken the LIGHTS of the World; and render the SALT of the Earth insipid; and no Wonder then they are of no Account.</P>
<P>To this End they must take heed of <HI>Ignorance.</HI> Knowledge is a good Medium to preseve their Character; but Ignorance will render them con∣temptible in the Eyes of Good and Bad. This may sometimes be from want of Natural Abili∣ties; and the defects of Nature are not to be <HI>Exposed,</HI> but <HI>Pitied.</HI> But this defect should keep them from invading that Office, where Know∣ledge is necessary; and Ignorance challenges Contempt, being Exposed to open view. There is good instruction in that Admonition that dropt from a Witty Pen,
<Q>If Owls would not be hooted at, let them keep close within the Tree, and not Perch upon the upper bows.</Q></P>
<P>Again, To this End Wisdom directs to avoid every thing that will argue a <HI>Servility</HI> of <HI>Temper</HI>: All Sordid Complyances with men of Corrupt Affections. They must take heed not to use any mean Acts of flattery to insinuate themselves into

the favour of Men. They must not stoop to any thing below the Dignity of their Station, to gain the Esteem of the World. All Methods of <HI>Dissimulation</HI> and <HI>Flattery</HI> argue a mean and lit∣tle Spirit, which is the proper object of Contempt. Thus they must Watch against every thing that is contrary to true <HI>Generosity,</HI> or <HI>Greatness</HI> of Soul▪ which should appear in their whole Deport∣ment; and which will make them <HI>Venerable</HI> in the Eyes of the World. They must avoid all Actions that will argue them to be under the influence of <HI>Narrow</HI> and <HI>Stingy Principles.</HI> Fear and Cowardise, an immoderate Opinion of, and Fondness for the Pomp and Grandeur of the World; Too nice a regard to circumstances, &amp; Shadows, and a disregard of Substantial Realities, will Tarnish the Glory of the brightest Cha∣racter, and invite the Contempt due to a <HI>Little</HI> and <HI>Mean</HI> Soul.</P>
<P>To this End they must be careful not to go to the <HI>Utmost Limits</HI> of what is Lawful. What others may do without Scandal and Reproach, Mini∣sters many times may not without <HI>Exposing their Character.</HI> Thus also all affectation, affected <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Modes of Speech, Gesture, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And a Spirit of Popularity are to be shun'd, if they would ob∣serve the Rules of true Prudence: For all these debase the <HI>High Calling</HI> of the Ministry, and de∣stroy that Respect and Reverence, which is requisite to a succesful discharge of their Office.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="42" REF="001329_0057_0FB27E0B50A66BB0"/>2. Prudence must be Exercised in forming a <HI>Right Judgment</HI> of <HI>Things, Persons,</HI> and <HI>Seasons,</HI> for the more Succesful discharge of the several parts of their Trust. There is a great variety of Cir∣cumstances which may have an aspect upon each of these, which must be understood in order to our carrying on our Work to the best advantage.</P>
<P>There must be a right Judgment of <HI>Actions and Things.</HI> The Apostle layes it down as a ne∣cessary point of true Knowledge and Judgment to <HI>Approve the things that are Excellent,</HI> or which differ, <HI>Phil.</HI> 1.10. There is a vast difference be∣tween things, and without the knowledge here∣of we can never make a Wise choice, which should be made according to the value, and rate that things bear. Some things are <HI>Essential</HI> and <HI>Fundamental,</HI> without which neither Grace here, nor Glory hereafter can be Expected; other things are <HI>Circumstantial</HI>: Some things are Du∣ties by <HI>Divine Institution,</HI> other things are so on∣ly from <HI>Principles</HI> of <HI>meer Prudence</HI>: Some things are the <HI>Weightier Matters of the Law,</HI> other things are but as the <HI>Tithings of Mint &amp; Cummin</HI>: Some are <HI>Gnaws,</HI> others <HI>Camels</HI>▪ Some are <HI>Moats,</HI> and others <HI>Beams,</HI> as our Saviour calls them: Some are indispensibly <HI>Necessary,</HI> other things are <HI>Ex∣pedient Pro hic ad nunc.</HI> And most frequently the Moral denomination of Actions, and especi∣ally as to their degree, does depend upon cir∣cumstances, which are Variable. Now Wisdom must discern between these, and the judgment
<PB N="43" REF="001329_0058_0FB27E0DC1343A40"/>
must conclude and determine accordingly. For things must be pressed, insisted on in pro∣portion to their necessity and excellency. The want of Prudence to make this judgment, is many times highly prejudicial to the Work of the Ministry.</P>
<P>Again, there must be a right judgment of <HI>Persons.</HI> Without this they can never divide e∣very one his <HI>Portion</HI> aright. All <HI>respect to Persons</HI> is not a <HI>Criminal Partiality</HI>; but there is a consi∣deration of <HI>Persons,</HI> and a distinguishing regard to them, which will argue no common Wisdom in the discharge of their Pastoral Care. There is a great difference in the <HI>Tempers</HI> of <HI>Persons</HI> to be treated with; nay a great variety is observa∣ble in the <HI>Frames</HI> and <HI>Dispositions</HI> of the same Person at different Seasons. That address that may be suitable to Melt one, may Exasperate another; that, which may be fit to <HI>Gain</HI> a man at one time, may have a tendency to <HI>Alienate</HI> him at another, and to fill him with prejudice against the Truth. Every man has some <HI>Qua∣lity,</HI> that renders him <HI>Accessable,</HI> and capable of perswasion, which if understood and wisely ad∣dressed would afford an happy prospect of Suc∣cess. And tho' Religion will not allow Mini∣sters to gratify the Vitious humours of men, yet Wisdom requires that care be taken to improve their tempers to the best advantage, to recover them from the Error of their Wayes. Wisdom requires a <HI>Distinction</HI> to be made between these
<PB N="44" REF="001329_0059_0FB27E0EC7E81028"/>
that are of a different <HI>Growth and Improvement</HI> in the School of Christ. <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Heb. 5.12.</NOTE> Some are <HI>Children</HI> and they must be fed with <HI>Milk</HI>; Some are <HI>Strong Men,</HI> and they can bear Strong <HI>Meat.</HI> <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Isa. 4<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.11.</NOTE> Some are <HI>Lambs</HI> in Christs Flock, and these must be gather'd with our Arms, and carryed in our Bo∣somes; Some are <HI>with Young,</HI> and these must be led with great tenderness, gentleness and com∣passion▪ There is a great difference in the diseases that Christs Flock may be infected with; which requires a different application▪ What is <HI>Obstinacy</HI> in one, is a <HI>Pitiable Infirmity</HI> in another; and the obstinate are to be sharply re∣proved; and the Weak to be pityed, and by de∣grees strengthen'd.</P>
<P>There is a difference to be observed between the <HI>Civil Characters</HI> of men, which Ministerial Wisdom directs to a due care not to make a breach upon in treating with them. They are not to be soothed up in any Evil wayes; Sin must not be suffer'd to ly upon these; the Rich and High are to be charged in the Name of Christ to perform the Duties, and shun the Sins, of their Station; their Sins are to be reproved▪ but Prudence directs that all this be done in a way consistent with that distinction that Provi∣dence has made. <HI>Nathan</HI> in reproving <HI>David</HI> has Set Ministers a Pattern to Write after. Su∣periors must not be insulted, nor exposed to the
<PB N="45" REF="001329_0060_0FB27E111FE28D48"/>
Contempt of those that are under them: The reproofs given them must not be <HI>Satyr</HI> which will Sting, but such Wise <HI>Remonstrance</HI> of their reproveable Actions, as shall at once convince of their own Error, and the respect and love of him that makes it.</P>
<P>Again, Wisdom requires a right <HI>Discerning</HI> of <HI>Times,</HI> and to act according to a true judgment of them. It is the Character of the Wise man, <HI>That his heart discerneth time and judgment,</HI> Eccles. 8.5. One season may afford an happy Conjun∣ction of favourable Circumstances, which may promise Christ's Ministers greater success in one part of their work, than another season may. Now a <HI>Word spoken in season</HI> has its peculiar <HI>beau∣ty</HI> and <HI>advantage.</HI> Ministers are not to be <HI>Time-servers</HI> to promote their own secular designs; but they must be <HI>Time-servers</HI> in suiting their Dispensations to the advantages that every sea∣son may peculiarly afford them to do good to Souls. A word seasonable at one time may not be so at another. Providences which are vari∣ous, call for that at one time, which they do not at another. And Wisdom obliges to a right Consideration, and Application proper to a day of Adversity, and to what is proper for a day of Prosperity. There are <HI>Truths of the day</HI> to be open'd and defended; <HI>Errors of the day</HI> to be de∣tected and confuted; <HI>Sins of the day</HI> to be Wit∣nessed against. And Prudence directs the Ser∣vants of God to a regard to these. There are
<PB N="46" REF="001329_0061_0FB27E14D7EB8518" MS="y"/>
some Seasons more proper than others to treat with the same Persons; and these must be watch'd for, and improved. This point of Wis∣dom <HI>Abigail</HI> critically observed in her treatment with the Churl <HI>Nabal.</HI> And <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the want of this many times <HI>Pearls are Exposed before Swine, and Holy things are thrown to Dogs.</HI> In these things therefore Ministers are to Exercise a dis∣cerning judgment: and so approve themselves Wise as well as Faithful.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Prudence</HI> must <HI>temper, regulate and proportion the expressions of their Zeal.</HI> Zeal is a Grace ne∣cessary to every Christian; and is required to an Eminent degree of those that <HI>watch for Souls.</HI> These are stiled <HI>Angels,</HI> who are <HI>Flames of Fire</HI>: They are to be like them in a warm Indignati∣on against Sin, in a burning love to Christ and Immortal Souls, and in holy ardours in the Ser∣vice of God. Lukewarmness and indifferency of spirit in the Cause of Christ, and of perish∣ing Souls, will be a reproach to their Work, and Master; and tends to make Sinners indif∣ferent and careless about the great interest of Eternity: whereas a well regulated zeal in the Advocates for God and Souls, will be a proper medium to make Sinners <HI>in earnest</HI> in working out their own Salvation. But all is not true zeal that men call so; what many times assumes the name is but a degenerate passion, a fury raised in their own cause, and not in Gods: It
<PB N="47" REF="001329_0062_0FB27E1641AEDCC8"/>
is a fire indeed, but an unhallowed one, not kindled at Gods Altar, that neither came from Heaven, nor ascends thither. It is therefore requisite that this affection be under an holy Goverment; which must be managed by that true wisdom <HI>that comes from Above.</HI> Prudence must direct it to a <HI>Right Object</HI>; for without that it will be a zeal not according to knowledge: the matter of it must be good; it must be pla∣ced upon true <HI>Catholick Christianity</HI>; and not on the <HI>Religion of a Party.</HI> It must be founded up∣on right and durable <HI>Principles,</HI> which right Rea∣son, and the Holy Word of God will justifie; and not built upon unaccountable <HI>Impulses,</HI> nor designed to serve the Interests of any particular party; <HI>Prudence here is profitable to direct.</HI></P>
<P>Again, Wisdom will see that it be exercised in ways consistent with Charity and Christi∣an Compassion; and not with the corrupt fer∣ment of wrath and bitterness to the persons of any. It must also <HI>Regulate the Measure</HI> and de∣gree of this affection. It must take care that it be only in proportion to the value and impor∣tance of the thing, about which zeal is exerci∣sed. It must not with the same heat be exer∣cised about <HI>Modes</HI> and disputable <HI>Rites,</HI> as about the <HI>Essentials</HI> of our <HI>Christian Faith,</HI> and <HI>Practice.</HI> The same degree of zeal is not due to Tithing Annise, Mint and Cummin, as to Righteous∣ness, Mercy and Peace, which are the weigh∣tier matters of the Law; and the very vitals of
<PB N="48" REF="001329_0063_0FB27E1D211FC838"/>
and undefiled Religion. Herein therefore Wis∣dom teaches them to make a difference in the expressions of their zeal; and not to pursue e∣very thing with equal heat, earnestness and pas∣sion. And this zeal, thus attemper'd and pro∣portioned to the weight of objects, and accord∣ing to these rules directed by Prudence, will help Christ's Ambassadors to carry on the <HI>Trea∣ty of Peace</HI> with Sinners to advantage.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Prudence</HI> is to direct them in the right ma∣nagement of their <HI>addresses</HI> to men. And there is a great degree of Prudence necessary to the right ordering of the Publick Discourses of Christ's Messengers: That they may know <HI>what to say,</HI> and <HI>what not</HI>; to determine in what <HI>Order, Method</HI> and <HI>Manner</HI> to treat of Divine Truths, that they may have the best influence upon their <HI>Audience.</HI> The Understanding is the <HI>Leading Faculty</HI> in the Soul, under the in∣fluence of its Light and Conduct the Will, Af∣fections, and all the executive powers are to be exercised. Hence Religion must first in order of nature have possession of this power; and consequently this Faculty must be first informed, and Wisdom will direct the Servants of God, like wise <HI>Master Builders</HI> to lay here the Foundation of true Divine Knowledge.</P>
<P>It will also instruct what things are to be taught in the <HI>First Place,</HI> and what <HI>Principally</HI> to be insisted on, with greatest frequency and inculcation. It must direct in the <HI>Choice of
<PB N="49" REF="001329_0064_0FB27E1F457EEFC8"/>
Subjects suitable to the state and necessities of a Peo∣ple.</HI></P>
<P>Wisdom must teach also in what <HI>Manner</HI> the <HI>Truths</HI> and <HI>Laws of Heaven</HI> are to be promulga∣ted. That they be dispensed with <HI>Gravity,</HI> without <HI>Affectation;</HI> with <HI>Zeal</HI> and <HI>Courage</HI> without <HI>Temerity;</HI> with <HI>Authority</HI> without <HI>Usur∣pation;</HI> with <HI>Tenderness</HI> and <HI>Affection</HI> without the <HI>Weakness</HI> of humane Passion. It must direct in the <HI>Dress</HI> and <HI>Language</HI> of their Discourses. This must be <HI>Intelligible, Pertinent,</HI> neither <HI>too La∣boured</HI> nor too <HI>Negligent,</HI> most expressive of the notions to be communicated, and free from that <HI>Pomp of Words</HI> that will obscure the Matter discoursed of: this latter must be avoided, left there be reason to say of a Discourse, as the Philosopher did of a Tragedy: <HI>It was a good One, if a man could have seen it for words.</HI> And as to the <HI>Language of Discourses,</HI> a difference must be allow'd, and is proper on several accounts: One Subject will allow greater Ornament of Language without any ostentation, than ano∣ther; an Address to the Affections will admit that Language which may not be so proper when the Understanding for its information is immediately apply'd to; there is a difference here also to be allowed between one Auditory and another; between common Discourses, and such as are made on some special Occasi∣on; and there is a difference between the Na∣tural and Acquired Gifts of Preachers, some
<PB N="50" REF="001329_0065_0FB27E2246401130"/>
being able to speak with greater <HI>Strength,</HI> others with more of <HI>Ornament</HI> and <HI>Politeness.</HI> Now Wisdom is to consider these different circum∣stances, to suit the Language to the <HI>Subject, Occasion,</HI> and <HI>End.</HI></P>
<P>Again, This must direct to the best <HI>method</HI> of discoursing: This can't be always the same, a variety of Subjects to be treated on, will not allow it. But Prudence will teach that Discour∣ses be made always in the most easy, natural, and intelligible method, that the matter will allow. This will be not only helpful to the <HI>Memory</HI> in <HI>retaining,</HI> but to the <HI>Understanding</HI> in taking a just view of things.</P>
<P>In all these things the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of the Heralds of the Everlasting Gospel is to be displayed, to promote the good Entertainment of their Mes∣sage.</P>
<P>And thus we have finished the Consideration of their Qualifications. We proceed to the last thing.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>IV.</HI> Lastly, We are to Consider that <HI>Distin∣guishing Reward</HI> that will be given them when their work is done. <HI>They shall be Blessed.</HI> Here two things.</P>
<P N="1">1. They shall obtain the <HI>Reward</HI> of <HI>Blessedness.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. This their Reward shall be <HI>distinguishingly great.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Wise</HI> and <HI>Faithful Servant</HI> shall obtain the <HI>Reward</HI> of <HI>Blessedness.</HI> This reward com∣prehends
<PB N="51" REF="001329_0066_0FB27E23C9BCBCA0"/>
in it a perfect freedom from all dis∣quieting Evils, and the full possession of all Sa∣tisfying Good. The <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Excellency,</HI> of this reward, we are not able in our present Embodied State, to take a comprehensive view of. We have not Faculties enlarged to that <HI>Ca∣pacity,</HI> nor refined to that <HI>Purity,</HI> and <HI>Clearness,</HI> nor Exalted to that <HI>Strength</HI> and <HI>Vigour,</HI> which are necessary to Entertain, and bear an <HI>Open View</HI> of Future Glory. The Object is too Vast and Bright, and our Understanding too weak, narrow, and earthy. A Sight of it in its true beauty, brightness and fullness, would dazle, confound and overpower the mind; &amp; Mor∣tality must sink under the very sight of that weight of Glory. God has seen meet in con∣descention to our Infirmity, to represent this under the shadow of such Earthly Things which have most of <HI>Profit, Pleasure</HI> and <HI>Honour</HI> in them: But after all, the Reward is Great and Excellent, beyond thought and expression.</P>
<P>This however we may be sure of is contain∣ed in it, <HI>viz.</HI> That these <HI>Blessed Ones,</HI> during their State of Separation from the Body, shall be safely lodged by their Lord, who has the KEYS of the INVISIBLE WORLD, in the <HI>Paradise</HI> of God, a place of inconceivable <HI>Re∣freshment;</HI> a Place so bright and serene, as not to need either <HI>Sun</HI> or <HI>Moon</HI> to Enlighten it. <HI>Where</HI> they shall Enjoy the happy <HI>Society</HI> of An∣gels and Perfected Spirits; nay, of CHRIST
<PB N="52" REF="001329_0067_0FB27E2A82130568"/>
himself; with whom they shall live in the Ex∣ercise of the wisest acts of Endearment, and in the highest Expressions of mutual Love and Friendship. <HI>There</HI> their Employ will be that of Angels, every way suited to the Perfection of Glorify'd Saints. <HI>There</HI> they shall be fully freed from all that Sin that here infested them; from all those sufferings that here griev'd them; from all those Labours that here wasted their Spirits; from all those Enemies that were here shooting their envenom'd arrows to wound their peace. <HI>There</HI> the <HI>Divine Image</HI> which was here begun, will receive its finishing strokes: Their knowledge will be without Error, or faulty Ignorance; their Holiness without De∣fect; their Love in its Perfection; and their Joy in its Fullness: and all their Enjoyments will be agreeable, not to a <HI>State of Tryal,</HI> which is now over, but to a <HI>Life</HI> of <HI>Rewards.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Day</HI> of the <HI>Final Judgment</HI> they shall appear as true CHILDREN OF THE RESUR∣RECTION: Their Bodies shall be <HI>Transfigured</HI> according to the Glory, Purity &amp; Perfection of the Resurrection Body of the Son of God. They shall appear in all circumstances of Honour before the General Assembly of Hell, Earth and Heaven▪ And when the affairs of this Day are finished, they shall ascend with their Glorify'd Master, above the visible Heavens; and with Him En∣ter in Triumph into the <HI>City of God;</HI> and shall Sit down with him upon his Throne, &amp; shall
<PB N="53" REF="001329_0068_0FB27E2C019DC1E0"/>
be FOR EVER WITH HIM to behold and Par∣take in his Glory. But after all, <HI>How small a Por∣tion is Known of it!</HI> tho' more than enough to pronounce them <HI>Blessed.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Reward</HI> of Wise and Faithful Mini∣sters shall be <HI>Distinguishingly Great.</HI> I am not ig∣norant that the Doctrine of <HI>Degrees of Glory</HI> has been holy disputed in the <HI>Schools.</HI> The <HI>Affirmative</HI> seems so agreeable to the Principles of Right Reason, and so clearly revealed in the infallible Oracles of Truth; that to me it appears more than <HI>Problematical.</HI> The <HI>Schoolmen</HI> indeed and <HI>Doctors</HI> in the <HI>Church of Rome</HI> build this upon a rotten Foundation, <HI>viz.</HI> The different degrees of Merit in Good Works. But their Error ought not to shake the true foundation of this Doctrine; which appears with a clear Light in the <HI>Sure Word of Prophesy.</HI> Here we are taught to distin∣guish between the <HI>Reward</HI> of a <HI>Prophet,</HI> and the <HI>Reward</HI> of a <HI>Righteous</HI> Man, <HI>Mat.</HI> 10.41, 42. The Parable of the Talents appears to assert &amp; justi∣fy different degrees of Glory: <HI>Luke</HI> 19.16, 17, 18, 19. Where we find every Servant received from his Lord in proportion to his Improvement of what had been committed to him. And the Truth flows not from a bare <HI>Circumstance</HI> of the Parable; but from the <HI>Main Scope</HI> of it, which was to Excite Christians to an Improvement of their Talents in proportion to what they had re∣ceived; and the Argument to engage to it is that their <HI>Reward</HI> shall be <HI>Proportionable.</HI> He that
<PB N="54" REF="001329_0069_0FB27E30B58A9AA0"/>
gains ten Pounds shall be Ruler over ten Cities; and he that gains five shall Rule over five Cities. This Doctrine also is asserted by the Apostle as an Argument to engage the Corinthians to abound in Works of Charity &amp; Liberality, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9.6. <HI>He that Soweth Sparingly shall reap Sparingly; But he that Soweth Bountifully, shall reap Bountifully.</HI> In which there would be no force or motive if there be not a Distinction between the Rewards of the blessed. And this point seems still to be set in a fuller Light, in the 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.41, 42. There is one <HI>Glory</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> another of the <HI>Moon</HI>; a∣nother <HI>Glory</HI> of the <HI>Stars</HI>; for one <HI>Star</HI> differeth from another Star in <HI>Glory: So</HI> also is the <HI>Resur∣rection</HI> of the <HI>Dead.</HI> Many other places might have been brought to have given in their Testi∣mony to confirm the Doctrine asserted; but it seems needless, Scripture appears for it, and has nothing, that I know of, against it: Nor do any of the pretended Arguments against it seem to be of any force. This will not infer a real <HI>Im∣perfection</HI> in the blessedness of such Saints as En∣joy a <HI>Less Degree</HI> of Glory. A <HI>Star</HI> is as perfect in its order as the <HI>Sun,</HI> yet they shine with a dif∣ferent Lustre. And I do not at present see any Absurdity in allowing a different Strength and Capacity in the blessed. Every Soul shall be full of Glory, but One may be capable to con∣tain more than another. Saints are not Imper∣fect when they first Enter upon their Inheri∣tance; yet a growth and improvement seems
<PB N="55" REF="001329_0070_0FB27E32CB1F2EE8"/>
reasonable to be allow'd them. Knowledge is an Essential part of their happiness; and in this undoubtedly they will be always making Ad∣vances. The knowledge of Angels to be sure was improved by the Coming of Christ, and the Gospel Revelation made to the Church, <HI>Eph.</HI> 3.10. And yet before that, they were perfectly blessed; tho' this their increase of knowledge must add to their Glory.</P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> This will not conclude any <HI>Imperfecti∣on</HI> in the <HI>Interest</HI> that the Least Saint has in the <HI>Merits of Christ,</HI> which purchased this Glory, and the highest Degrees of it. The <HI>Graces</HI> of <HI>Sancti∣fication</HI> in this Life are the purchase of Christs Righteousness; yet there is not an <HI>Equality</HI> of these conferred upon believers here. And <HI>Dif∣ferent Degrees of Grace</HI> in this Life seem as incon∣sistent with an Equal Interest in the Merits of Christ, as <HI>Different Degrees of Glory</HI> in the Next. But the Truth appears to me to lye thus. The Meritorious Obedience and Sufferings of Christ were a <HI>Refusable Price</HI> in themselves, which God was at Liberty to accept or refuse, antecedently to his own Promise: And so was at liberty to accept it for <HI>Whom,</HI> and to <HI>what Degree</HI> He saw meet. By free Compact between the Father and Son it was agreed to be accepted for the full Pardon, Justification and Happiness of all God's Chosen and Sanctifyed, and for the pur∣chase of a greater degree of Glory for some, that should distinguish themselves in higher degrees of
<PB N="56" REF="001329_0071_0FB27E344AC80668"/>
Holiness. And all this may be and yet an <HI>Equa∣lity</HI> be asserted in their <HI>Election, Adoption,</HI> and <HI>Justification.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Now,</HI> if there be such a gradual difference in the Glory that shall be revealed in the Saints; Doubtless, those that have been <HI>Wise</HI> and <HI>Faith∣ful Stewards</HI> in Gods House here, will obtain a proportionable Exaltation in the Kingdom of Glory. Their Lord will distinguish them by Particular Marks of Honour there, as they have distinguished themselves here in Zeal and Fidelity in his Service. The Service they are now called to is Honourable, Great, and Diffi∣cult; the Discouragements they meet with, the Temptations they conflict with, the Self-denyal they must Exercise, are all <HI>Peculiarly</HI> great; if therefore under all they maintain their Post, are Wise and Faithful, their Reward will be as <HI>Pecu∣liar.</HI> They are now placed in a Station of Ho∣nour and Dignity, if they are Faithful to their Trust, Christ will not <HI>Degrade</HI> them in the other World. And this distinguishing Glory the Pro∣phet <HI>Daniel</HI> refers to, Dan. 12.3. <HI>And they that are Wise shall shine as the Bightness of the Firmament; and they that turn many to Righteousness as the Stars for Ever and Ever.</HI></P>

with them. To Rule and Feed Christ's Flock, is a Work, which who is sufficient for? The dreadful Office of Watching, not only for their own, but the Souls of others, is enough to make the most Strong and Perfect of meer men to tremble. And if we add to these the considera∣tion of their own Weakness, Sins, and Imper∣fections; the obstinacy of Secure, Proud Sin∣ners, that they have to do with; the many strong Temptations that continually assault them, &amp; the many circumstances of discourage∣ment they are under; we must conclude that without a Superior Influence to Sustain, Encou∣rage, and Strengthen them, they will infalli∣bly faint in their Work: and resolve with the Prophet to Speak no more in the Name of the Lord.

<P><HI>USE. III.</HI> This sets before <HI>Christ's Labour∣ers</HI> the Strongest Motives to be diligent in their Masters Vineyard. Ministers ordinarily have little or nothing on this side Eternity to encou∣rage them, but much on the contrary; there is the frowardness of some, the wickedness of o∣thers, and the difficulty of their work at the best, which if flesh and blood were consulted with, would make them lay down their Office: But they have a glorious Prospect beyond the Grave. They have the Promise of a Reward that will infinitely compensate all they undergo in their Masters Service. And are assured that the Ho∣nour done them at last will be in proportion to their Diligence &amp; Application to the Work of the Lord. And surely the Prospect of this is suffici∣ent to inspire them with Zeal, Courage, Vigour and Unfainting Resolution.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="001329_0074_0FB27E41DC1BDCA0"/><HI>USE IV.</HI> This affords both <HI>Direction,</HI> and <HI>Incentive</HI> to the People of God, in <HI>Praying</HI> for their Ministers.</P>
<P>It <HI>directs</HI> a People to Pray that God would qualifie them for their work, and assist and prosper them in the discharge of it: That they may find <HI>Mercy</HI> to be faithful and wise in Feeding &amp; Ruling Christ's Houshold: that those Gifts and Graces may be multiplied upon them; in the faithful improvement where∣of they may <HI>Save their own Souls,</HI> and the <HI>Souls of them that hear them.</HI></P>
<P>It affords also the most <HI>Moving Arguments</HI> to Engage a People to the constant Exercise of this duty of Prayer for their Pastors. For if <HI>this</HI> be their <HI>Work,</HI> which has been now laid down; if <HI>these</HI> the <HI>Qualifications</HI> necessary to the due discharge of the duties of their Function; then we may be sure they need much of the <HI>Divine Presence</HI> and <HI>Blessing,</HI> and much of the Prayers of their People, as a medium to obtain these. The very nature of their work contains in it the most powerful motives and perswasives hereto. It tells a People that if they have any tender regard to the honour of Christ, if any Love to his Spirit, if any true Compassion to their own Souls, and the Souls of others; if any respect and tenderness for Christ's Messen∣gers, they must with the most pressing instan∣ces, constantly address the Throne of Grace in their behalf.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="001329_0075_0FB27E434612AC18"/>Let then the consideration of these things move this <HI>Assembly</HI> before the Lord this Day, to lift up their Hearts and Eyes with the greatest efforts of Faith, and ardours of Devotion to God for his Blessing upon all his Servants; and in especial manner for that <HI>Un∣worthy Person,</HI> who now addresses you in the Name of the Lord. Pray with incessant im∣portunity, that God would give him a <HI>Double Portion</HI> of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> Gifts and Graces of his <HI>As∣cended Master and Father,</HI> who has lately been snatcht from his <HI>Head</HI>; That he may enjoy the Presence of Christ with him, to assist &amp; streng∣then him to his work; to make him faithful to Christ, and wise to win Souls; that he may fulfil his Ministry, and give up his Account with joy to the Great <HI>Bishop of Souls.</HI> Suffer therefore that address made by the Apostle, <HI>Rom.</HI> 15.30. <HI>Now I beseech you Brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of his Spirit, that ye strive together with me, in your Prayers to God for ME.</HI></P>
<P><HI>USE V.</HI> Hence the <HI>Death</HI> of WISE and FAITHFUL MINISTERS is a great <HI>Judgment,</HI> which calls for deep <HI>Resentment.</HI> These are to be number'd among the <HI>First Rate</HI> Blessings of a People. They are the <HI>Purchase</HI> of the Death, and the <HI>Gifts</HI> of the Ascention of our <HI>Enthroned Jesus.</HI> And in proportion to their value, must the loss of them be rated. God threatens his
<PB N="61" REF="001329_0076_0FB27E44C27CAC48"/>
People to take away the <HI>Prophet,</HI> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Isai. 3.2.</NOTE> as one of the highest Expressions of his anger. When therefore he comes and executes that threaten∣ing, he expects it be suitably resented: and it will be laid to heart by every Soul whose <HI>flesh trembleth for fear of God, and is afraid of his Judg∣ments.</HI></P>
<P>THIS necessarily brings me to the SORROW∣FUL SUBJECT, which has been the occasion of my present Meditations: To take a view of that <HI>Awful Rebuke of Heaven</HI> upon this <HI>Whole LAND,</HI> &amp; on <HI>this CONGREGATION</HI> in particular, in the sudden Departure of that Eminent MAN OF GOD, who has been for so long a time the Light, Joy and Glory of this Place: By whose Trans∣lation God has given us reason to a great de∣gree to take up that Lamentation; <HI>The joy of our heart is ceased, our Dance is turned into Mourn∣ing; The Crown is fallen from our heads; For</HI> THIS <HI>our heart is faint, and our eyes are dim.</HI></P>
<P>I must freely confess, I never had any fond∣ness for <HI>Funeral Encomiums;</HI> unless when Gifts and Graces have been Eminent &amp; Distinguish∣ing; when the Honour of Christ the fountain from whence they flow'd, Justice to the Dead, and the Good of the Living, do demand them; and when the Merits of the Departed leave no room, at least no necessity for the paint of Flattery.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="001329_0077_0FB27E48994836B8"/><HI>Sure I am,</HI> on this present Melancholly Oc∣casion, the just sense I have of my own <HI>Pecu∣liar Share</HI> in this Loss, makes it more eligible to take my place in the <HI>Silent Train of Mourners,</HI> that nothing might interrupt the Sighs &amp; Tears of a wounded Spirit; than to appear in this <HI>Desk.</HI> But the Duties of my Station require, that at present I chain up my passions, suppress my own sorrows, and bank up the swelling Tide of Grief; that it may not disturb me, while I am paying to the <HI>Memory</HI> of my Trans∣lated Father, that <HI>Just Tribute,</HI> which all, but the Ignorant and Envious, will acknowledge due by all the Laws of Justice and Gratitude.</P>
<P>I am deeply sensible how every way Une∣qual I am to my present Province, to do his Memory justice; and what danger I am in of slurring his Character by my unskilful hand. I have neither Art to draw his Picture, nor yet to set it, when drawn, in a true Light, that it may be seen to advantage. What <HI>Livy</HI> says of the <HI>Roman Orator,</HI> discourages me: That to give <HI>Cicero</HI> his just Encomium, <HI>Cicerone Lauda∣tore opus est.</HI> To give a Great man his just praises, requires the skill of One as Great. However, Duty to Christ, whose Servant he was, and with whose Gifts and Graces he was conspicuously adorned; a just honour for the Memory of a Prophet of no common Figure, a Pastor, Father and Friend, do constrain me to rise up and <HI>Call him Blessed</HI>; and command me to Essay his CHARACTER.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="001329_0078_0FB27E4AD20812D8"/>His DESCENT was <HI>Honourable,</HI> from a Sage Patriot in our Israel; whose Wisdom assigned him a Seat at the <HI>Council-Board,</HI> and his Military Skill, and Martial Spirit intituled him to the Chief Place in the <HI>Field</HI>: But in no External regard could be more Honourable than in be∣ing the FATHER of such a SON.</P>
<P>In Him Bountiful Heaven was pleased to cause a Concurrence of all those Natural and Acquired, Moral and Spiritual Excellencies, which are necessary to constitute a <HI>Great Man,</HI> a profound <HI>Divine,</HI> a very considerable <HI>Scholar,</HI> and an Heavenly <HI>Christian.</HI> In the light and influence of these Perfections he appeared as a Star of the First Magnitude in the Orb of the Church.</P>
<P>The God of Nature was pleased with a <HI>Liberal Hand</HI> to bestow on him those Natural Intellectu∣al Endowments, which laid the Foundation of Great Improvement in Knowledge. And did from his Youth praesage <HI>Uncommon</HI> Service for God and his People, which his Master had de∣signed him for. In Natural Endowments, he appeared as the <HI>Elder Son</HI> among many Brethren: In these very few, if any, could pretend to stand upon a Level with him. The Natural Capacity of his Soul was of that <HI>Distinction,</HI> that it seem'd an undeniable Confutation of the Doctrine of the <HI>Equality</HI> of Souls; and left it no longer Pro∣blematical.</P>
<P>His <HI>Phansy</HI> was Copious, tho' not Luxuriant,
<PB N="64" REF="001329_0079_0FB27E4C445953B8"/>
but most Correct, being Obsequious to the Dictates, and kep't under the Strict Guard of a well poised judgment: By which it was restrained from those lawless Luxuriances &amp; Ex∣travagances, which this power is Subject to, when it has broken loose from the Government of a well-informed Understanding. His <HI>Apprehension</HI> was quick, his <HI>Reason</HI> bright, and his <HI>Judgment</HI> exact and solid: which made him banish such things as trivial, as were not capable of Im∣provement to advance his Soul, either in its <HI>Intellectual</HI> or <HI>Moral Perfection.</HI> His <HI>Understand∣ing</HI> was of Great Prospect: His mind filled with bright Images of things; inricht with a vast number of noble Ideas, and knew well their several Connexions, Relations and Dependen∣cies, how to separate, and how to unite them in deep searches after Truth. He had a deep thought, and penetrating <HI>Sagacity</HI> to make a just Estimate of things on sudden Emergencies; which made him justly Esteem'd One of the <HI>Wisest Men,</HI> that has been known, of his <HI>Order,</HI> in Our Land. His <HI>Natural Genius</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> seem'd superior to all narrow selfish Interests; not govern'd by Rules of Carnal Policy, nor byast by private views; but appear'd almost uncapable to be under the commanding influ∣ence of any thing, but what appeared Great, Good and Honourable. He had a <HI>Native Mo∣desty,</HI> which continued in his advanced years, seldom known in Conjunction with Gifts of
<PB N="65" REF="001329_0080_0FB27E4E95C2EC40"/>
so Conspicuous an Elevation; which might seem to some to <HI>Vail</HI> the Brightness of some of his Publick Appearances; tho' in the Opinion of others was but a <HI>Foil</HI> to his greater Excel∣lencies.</P>
<P>These <HI>Gifts of Nature</HI> in him were Advanced and rendred more bright by Great Improvements of Hard Study, Intimate Acquaintance with Many of the most Celebrated Authors in the Learned World, by long Experience and Con∣stant Prayer. He was well Versed in the Prin∣cipal parts of <HI>Substantial Learning</HI>; which fur∣nished him with that Knowledge, which was re∣quisite for a <HI>Wise Master Builder in the House and Temple of the Living God.</HI> He always affected that Learning, which was least for <HI>Pomp</HI> and <HI>Ostentation,</HI> &amp; most for <HI>Service</HI>; the Knowledge of Things more than of empty Words &amp; Names: And he must be allowed the Character of an <HI>Uncom∣mon Schollar</HI>; If the Knowledge of those things, which perfect the Understanding, may be al∣lowed Worthy of the title of <HI>Learning.</HI> And I think it is High Time to reject other Knowledge, which does not <HI>Better</HI> or <HI>Improve</HI> the <HI>Mind,</HI> which does not <HI>Profit,</HI> but only <HI>Amuse,</HI> as Unworthy of the <HI>Specious Title,</HI> at least unfit to IMPRO∣PRIATE the Name of <HI>Learning.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Divinity</HI> was his Favourite Study; and in the pursuit of this most Excellent &amp; Divine Know∣ledge, he engaged not only from Duty, but Incli∣nation. And Excelled to an Eminent degree in the
<PB N="66" REF="001329_0081_0FB27E55098ED2B8"/>
Knowledge of the most Abstruse parts of Theo∣logy. And a Great Divine must of necessity be a Great Clerk.</P>
<P>He was a <HI>Judicious Textuary.</HI> Like Apollos a Man mighty in the Scripture. His common Publick Discourses were a Demonstration of this; but especially those <HI>Judicious</HI> and <HI>Elaborate</HI> COMMENTARIES, made in the <HI>School of the Prophets,</HI> upon several whole Books of the Divine Oracles, remain as a Lasting Monument of this skill.</P>
<P>His Knowledge in <HI>Systematical Divinity</HI> was celebrated by all. He had a Body of Divinity well digested in his head. And was careful to hold fast the Form of Sound Words. His Know∣ledge was not like a Light in a Dark Lanthorn: But out of the Treasury of his Head and Heart was able to communicate to others. He had a great Dexterity in confirming Truths by Incon∣testible Arguments, and to Set them in an Ad∣vantagious Light; to Explain them fully, and Apply them with the greatest Clossness and Per∣tinency. This was observable in the Discharge of the Common Duties of his Pastoral Care: But this his Knowledge appeared with a pecu∣liar Lustre in his CATECHETICAL LECTURES, which if Published, would be found One of the best Bodies of Divinity, that has been known.</P>
<P>In <HI>Controversy</HI> he was a Champion, a Worthy of the First Stength, Skill, and Courage. He
<PB N="67" REF="001329_0082_0FB27E57A46BB718"/>
was qualifyed for it by a clear Head, a cool Thought, and Inflexible Principles. He was able to weild the Sword of the Spirit to the Ter∣rour of Gainsayers; to their Confutation, tho' not always to their Conviction: And has once and again sheathed this Sword of the Spirit in the Bowels of Triumphant Errors. And was every way fit to be Set for <HI>the Defence of the Gospel.</HI></P>
<P>He was an <HI>Excellent Casuist.</HI> Where the Per∣plexed and Scrupulous might have their diffi∣culties Eased, their doubts resolved with Safety. When any Cases of Conscience came under his thought, he was wont to handle them with Wise Caution, and admirable Compassion; He deli∣berated Maturely on all circumstances, and laid the Whole by the Unerring Rule, and with great judgment determined agreeably.</P>
<P>All that knew him, and were Competent judges of his Worth, must do him the Honour and Justice, to Acknowledge these Gifts were Eminent in him. And these rendred him as Capable as any man to direct the <HI>Sons of the Pro∣phets,</HI> and <HI>Young Divines</HI> in their <HI>Theological Stu∣dies</HI>; &amp; I believe was as oft as any addressed to on this Head. His DIRECTIONS to the <HI>Can∣didates of the Ministry,</HI> left in the hands of many, are of great Value and Service, and will be a Testimony how Safe and Skilful a <HI>Guide</HI> he was.</P>
<P>As he was Excelling in <HI>Gifts,</HI> so he was no
<PB N="68" REF="001329_0083_0FB27E593848FF20"/>
less Eminent in the <HI>Graces of Christ.</HI> He had A Sanctifyed Heart as well as a Well-Regulated, Logical Head; and was a Scholar of great Pro∣ficiency in the School of Christ. His <HI>Graces</HI> Consecrated his Gifts, and made them appear with a more observable lustre, with Life as well as Light. All the Vertues of the Divine Nature and Life were visible in his Holy Walk: Which openly discover'd his Soul to be A LIVING TEMPLE of the LORD JEHOVAH, where his Throne was prepared, his Image set up, and his Spirit dwelt. With what warm Transports of Affection and Admiration would he discourse, or hear of the <HI>Wonders</HI> of Divine Grace Unveil'd in the whole Method of the Redemption of man? How low did he bow in profound Re∣verence and Adoration of the Spotless Sove∣reignty of God in the Mysterious Dispensati∣ons of the Kingdom both of Grace and Provi∣dence? How jealous was he in his whole Con∣versation of the Honour of Sovereign Grace? How fearful lest any thing should betray it, or cloud its Glory? How thoughtful also least Grace should be abused unto Wantonness? And how careful in all his Dispensations to guard against this Mystery of Iniquity, and to set out the Glory of Divine Grace, and the Beauty of Holiness in their proper Lustre and Admirable Harmony? His <HI>Zeal</HI> was what became an A∣postle; tho' flaming in the Cause of Christ, yet was temper'd by Love, and guided by Pru∣dence.
<PB N="69" REF="001329_0084_0FB27E5B51F2BA00"/>
No pretence could make him trans∣gress his own Line; and from the duties of his own Post nothing could move him. His Spirit was truly <HI>Pacifick;</HI> and could sacrifice every thing but Duty for Peace: And accounted no∣thing too dear, but Truth and Holiness, for the purchase of it. He was a Lively Example of Self-denyal, and seperation from the World, of Patience under the reproaches of men, and Suf∣ferings from God, and of Resignation to the <HI>Absolute Supremacy</HI> of Heaven under the Darkest Dispensations. The most black and sorrowful Providence never caused him to <HI>hang his Harp</HI> on the Willows, or so put him out of <HI>Tune,</HI> as to unfit him to Sing a <HI>Zions Song of Praise</HI>: But he could discourse of, nay realize, the Excel∣lency and Glory, the Majesty, Righteousness and Grace of his Masters Kingdom, even when <HI>Clouds and Darkness were about his Throne.</HI></P>
<P>No man had a deeper sense of the Poverty, Impotency and Depravation of Humane Na∣ture by the Apostacy; nor any a clearer view of the <HI>Fulness of that Provision</HI> made in <HI>Christ</HI> for the Sinners Righteousness and Salvation. The <HI>Body of Sin</HI> was his constant Burden, which he bewailed, groaned under, &amp; expressed his long∣ing desire to be freed from in some of his latest hours. <HI>Meditation,</HI> which gives Life and Power to Grace, was his Exercise and Delight; and to what good purpose he performed this, may be seen in many SACRAMENTAL MEDI∣TATIONS,
<PB N="70" REF="001329_0085_0FB27E5F4844D628"/>
penned for his own Use, which are left behind him. He undoubtedly lived un∣der the View of the UNSEEN WORLD, which he is now gone to, &amp; is filled with the Glory of.</P>
<P>These <HI>Gifts</HI> and <HI>Graces</HI> in Conjunction made him in a great degree Equal to the <HI>Station</HI> his Lord had fixed him in. And this was the Stage on which they appeared with beauty, and acted their Part with Glory. All that has been said, in describing the <HI>Evangelical Pastor</HI> under the Doctrine, belong to his Character: whose Pic∣ture therein I was designedly drawing. And his <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Fidelity</HI> in their most comprehensive sense, in Feeding and Ruling the House of God, are justly Celebrated thro' these Churches.</P>
<P>At <HI>first</HI> in his younger Years, his Master com∣mitted to his Pastoral Care a Flock in a more obscure part of this Wilderness: But so great a Light was soon observed thro' the whole Land: And his Lord did not design to bury him in ob∣scurity, but to place him in a more Eminent Station, which he was qualifyed for. The Providence that occasioned his Removal to this Place was an <HI>Awful Judgment</HI> upon the whole Land; yet was Eventually a <HI>Mercy</HI> in this re∣spect, that it made way for the Translation of this Bright Star to a more Conspicuous Orb; where his Influence was more Extensive and Beneficial; and in this it was a great <HI>Blessing</HI> to this <HI>Congregation,</HI> to this <HI>Town,</HI> nay, to all <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="001329_0086_0FB27E62B7E353C8"/>With what <HI>Prudence</HI> and <HI>Faithfulness, Diligence</HI> and <HI>Impartiality,</HI> he discharged the duties of his Pastoral Office to this Flock, GOD, CHRIST and ANGELS are Witnesses; and I doubt not but he has received the Testimony hereof from many in the World of <HI>Perfected Spirits,</HI> who have been Blessing God for him, as the Instrument by whom they have been led to Glory: And I trust there are many yet <HI>Living,</HI> and now <HI>Stand∣ing before God,</HI> who are the <HI>Seals</HI> of his Ministry, and will be his CROWN and JOY in the Day of the Lord. In his whole Ministry he expres∣sed a true love and zeal for Christ, and tender compassion to Immortal Souls: There was light, heat and life in all his Addresses to them, which argued he well understood the worth of Souls, and had a just sense of their miserable Apostate Circumstances.</P>
<P>His <HI>Discourses</HI> were all Elaborate, Acute and Judicious; Smelt of the Lamp, &amp; had nothing <HI>Mean</HI> in them. His Common Sermons might have been pronounced with Applause before an Assembly of the Greatest Divines. The <HI>Matter</HI> of his Publick Discourses was alwayes weighty; His Subjects well Chosen; suited to the State of his Flock, and every way adapted to make them Wiser and Better. The <HI>Articles of Faith</HI> he Opened and Confirmed; The <HI>Du∣ties of Holiness</HI> he Explained, and Enforced with the most powerful Arguments; and with an <HI>Address</HI> suited to melt the Rocky Heart, to bow
<PB N="72" REF="001329_0087_0FB27E64B5156E88"/>
the Stubborn Will, to humble the proudest Sin∣ner, and charm the deafest Adder. The <HI>Man∣ner</HI> in which he deliver'd his Discourses was a∣greeable to the Matter. In respect of both he Spoke as became the ORACLES of GOD: With Gravity, Courage, Zeal and Prudence, and with tender Bowels to perishing Souls. His <HI>Language</HI> was always good; His Stile Mascu∣line, not Perplexed, but Easy as well as Strong. And when the Matter required it, no man could speak with a greater <HI>Pathos</HI> and <HI>Pungency.</HI></P>
<P>He applyed himself to <HI>Wounded Consciences</HI> with great Skill, Faithfulness and Tenderness. He searcht their Wounds to the bottom, and made Application of <HI>Terror</HI> or <HI>Comfort,</HI> as their State called for, and as became a Wise, Tender and Faithful Physician: And he knew how to be a <HI>Son of Thunder</HI> to the Secure and Hardened; and a <HI>Son of Consolation</HI> to the Contrite and Bro∣ken in Spirit.</P>
<P>His <HI>Publick Prayers</HI> were always Pertinent and Pathetical, animated with the Spirit of Devo∣tion; and in them an <HI>Uncommon Compass of Thought was observable.</HI> In the Whole of his Work he was Laborious, careful to redeem time, and was instant in season and out of season in his Masters Service.</P>
<P>His Affection &amp; Tenderness to THIS HIS DEAR FLOCK was singular. He might have said with the Apostle, that he could have impart∣ed with the GOSPEL his own SOUL to them.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="001329_0088_0FB27E669E7CF650" MS="y"/>As a Wise and Faithful Steward over this House of Christ, he gave every man his Portion in due Season. And might at his Departure have called Heaven and Earth to Record, That he had not shun'd to declare the Whole <HI>Counsel of God,</HI> and was <HI>Pure</HI> from the <HI>Blood</HI> of all men.</P>
<P>He went before this Flock as a Good She∣pherd, Gathering the <HI>Lambs</HI> with his <HI>Arm,</HI> car∣rying them in his <HI>Bosome,</HI> and <HI>Gently</HI> driving those that are <HI>With Young</HI>: And is now gone to the GREAT <HI>Shepherd</HI> of the SHEEP; whose Flock he here Watch't over, Lead, Fed and Defended.</P>
<P>He took his FAREWELL of us at the TA∣BLE of the LORD; and shall Enjoy no more such Fellowship with him, till we come to Eat Bread and Drink New Wine with Him; in our Fathers Presence.</P>
<P>AND how deeply should we resent the hand of God herein Stretch't out against us?</P>
<P>GOD Calls this Whole People to lay it to Heart, and to improve this Awful Providence to awaken to Repentance.</P>
<P><HI>His Removal</HI> is a Great Judgment upon the whole Land. He was a Great Blessing to it by his Faithful Warnings, Counsels, Prayers and Tears, Life and Doctrine. He was a Main Pil∣lar in our Building, which is Weakened by his fall; A Main Stake in our Hedge is pluck't up, which has made a wide Gap, &amp; made the whole

Wall about this Vineyard to totter. He was a Great part of the Chariots and Horse-men of our Israel; A Faithful Watchman, <HI>Quick</HI> to espy danger, and <HI>Faithful</HI> to Sound an Alarm: And has often Warned this People of Evils Ap∣proaching, and against their Sins the procuring Cause of them. He was alwayes ready to stand in the <HI>Gap</HI> in times of greatest hazard.</P>
<P>And it ought never to be forgotten, with what Prudence, Courage and Zeal he appeared for the good of this People, <HI>In that Dark and Mysterious Season,</HI> when we were assaulted from the Invisible World. And how Singularly In∣strumental he was in discovering the Cheats and Delusions of Satan, which <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> stained our Land with Blood, and did threaten to deluge it with all manner of Woes.</P>
<P>It is a <HI>Critical Season</HI> he is removed in; as dark a Day as ever passed over this Land; and it is well, if it be not a <HI>Praesage</HI> of greater dark∣ness; I am Sure the Setting of so Bright a Star will make it so.</P>
<P>We had scarce dry'd our Eyes for the loss of One <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Reverend Mr. <HI>Samuel Torrey.</HI></NOTE> SAMUEL, but Providence opens anew the Fountain of our Tears by Afflicting us with the Death of ANOTHER. It is well if the Conjunction of their Funerals be not Por∣tentous of further, and greater Calamities: I am sure it will be so if it be not laid to heart.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="001329_0090_0FB27E6EE293EDC0"/>It is a <HI>Humbling Rebuke</HI> to the Whole <HI>Ministry.</HI> By this Stroke of Heaven a Considerable part of their Strength, Wisdom, and Beauty is Gone; and a Cloud drawn over their Glory.

These he cherish't under his Wings, and was tender of their Persons and good Names: And often in∣terposed to put by those Thrusts that were made to Wound their Reputation; and they have now lost the Best Friend that Many of them ever had a this side Heaven.</P>
<P>His Removal is a <HI>Frown upon the School of the Prophets,</HI> which has been for several years un∣der his Faithful and Prudent Inspection. And God has now come to the <HI>Sons</HI> of the <HI>Prophets,</HI> and taken their MASTER from their Head.

<P>But we must remember, we must not <HI>Weep for them,</HI> but for <HI>our selves.</HI> Our Loss is their Gain: They have run their Race, finished their Course, and have laid hold of Eternal Life: They Dyed in the Lord and are Blessed. The thoughts of what State of Happiness they are gone to, should mix joy with our deepest grief. Love to them would not allow us, were it pos∣sible, to pluck them out of the <HI>Arms of their Re∣deemer,</HI> where they are solacing themselves; to call them back to this World of Sin and Dark∣ness, which we our selves are groaning for a Deliverance from.</P>
<P>Let this therefore asswage our griefs for the Death of that <HI>Prophet,</HI> over whose Tomb we have been now dropping our Tears.</P>
<P>He is Enter'd into his Masters Joy, and is possest of that immarcessable Crown of Glory, which with patience and agony of Soul he has been contending for. He is now free from the
<PB N="78" REF="001329_0093_0FB27E74C181D188"/>
stains of Sins, and pains of Suffering: He will never more cry out under the Weight of a Body of Death, nor ever-more be assaulted by the Grand Adversary of Souls. His Righteous Soul will be no more grieved with the impure Con∣versation of the Wicked; nor wounded with his own Infirmities. His Knowledge of God and Christ, his Love, Holiness and Joy are now in their Perfection. The Reward he has receiv∣ed is undoubtedly of <HI>Great Distinction,</HI> in propor∣tion to his Prudence, Zeal, Diligence and Fide∣lity in his Masters Service.</P>
<P>And will not this relieve our mournful thoughts? Is it no Consolation, for us to re∣flect on that State of Unstained Purity, Perfe∣ction, and full Satisfaction he is advanced to? Is it no Comfort under our Sorrows, to think, with what Congratulations of Triumphant Joy <HI>many</HI> of his <HI>Spiritual Children</HI> did welcome his safe Arrival to those Bright Realms of Light? And how all Heaven rung with new Anthems of Praise on this Occasion? To think what Honour was done him at his Admission into the Heavenly City by his Lord-Redeemer, An∣ge<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and the whole Assembly of the First-born? Is it no Joy to us to take a view of that Ocean of Delight he Swims in? What Bread of Angels he feeds on? How Bright and Massy the Crown his Master has fixed on his Head? Surely it cannot but please us to realize, that he that a few days since was with us viewing God and
<PB N="79" REF="001329_0094_0FB27E765B920B60"/>
Christ in the <HI>Dark Glass of Ordinances,</HI> is now Standing in his Masters Presence, and has a Sa∣tisfying, &amp; Transforming View of his FACE <HI>and</HI> GLORY. To consider with what fullness of Desire &amp; Satisfaction his Purify'd, Strengthen'd and Enlarged Powers behold the Glory of God, and drink down full draughts of those Ri∣vers of Truth, Goodness and Delight, that flow from the LIGHT of his COUNTENANCE: With what Transports of Soul he flings himself, and lays down his Crown before the THRONE of GOD and the LAMB; This cannot but af∣ford us some present Refreshment.</P>
<P>Do we not Rejoyce? When we Consider what <HI>Society</HI> he <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Associated with, who are most Knowing and Friendly; What <HI>Noble Service</HI> he is Employed in: While with Angels &amp; Crown∣ed Saints, he is Shouting forth HALLILUJAHS to the Honour of the LAMB that was Slain, who Redeem'd him, and Washed him in his Blood, &amp; has now presented him without SPOT before the Throne of God.</P>
<P>These thoughts should in some <HI>measure</HI> dry up our Tears; at least should <HI>turn</HI> our Grief into the Chanel of Godly Sorrow.</P>
<P><HI>What Remains</HI> but that we <HI>follow this</HI> Ser∣vant of God, as he followed Christ: <HI>That</HI> we
<PB N="80" REF="001329_0095_0FB27E7D12334188"/>
Imitate his Love, his Faith, Holiness and Pati∣ence in Well-doing. We have the Same Mas∣ter to Serve▪ the Same Spirit to assist us, and the Same Glory to Entertain us, if we are faith∣ful to the Death.</P>
<P>Thus let us prepare to follow: And this will give us a Comfortable Prospect, that when the time of our <HI>Dissolution</HI> shall come, we shall Goe to HIM, nay to CHRIST, which is infinitely better; And shall have our part in the WORK, and REWARDS of our Father's Kingdom.</P>
<P><HI>Let us now therefore Comfort our selves and one another with</HI> THESE THINGS.</P>
