<HEAD>AN ADDRESS, &amp;c.
<Q><HI>Resolved,</HI> Nem. Con. Dic. That the keeping a Standing Army in these Colonies, in Times of Peace, without the Consent of the Legis∣lature of the Colony in which such Army is kept, is against Law.</Q>
<BIBL><HI>Proc. of the Continental Congress.</HI></BIBL></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Brethren, Friends, and Countrymen.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE sanguinary schemes of the present Admi∣nistration have been sealed with the appro∣bation of the late ministerial Parliament. Every vessel that came to this, or the neighbouring ports, since the proceedings of our late Congress were published in London, brought us fresh intelligence of the hostile measures resolved on against us.—More regiments are to be sent over, some of which will be stationed in this metropolis, and in New-Jersey, to support the <HI>King's friends,</HI> to intimidate, and divide us, to be a check on the southern Colonies, and if judged practicable, to <HI>prevent</HI> their relieving our suffering brethren of the Massachusetts-Bay.</P>
<P>These particulars, and many more have, doubtless, come to the knowledge of that <HI>body,</HI> commonly stiled our <HI>Representatives</HI>:—And yet, amongst the objects of <HI>real</HI> complaint, <HI>resolved</HI> as such by that Assembly, in their late catalogue of grievances, we do not read any of the ruinous consequences of an act of Parliament, which was <HI>solely</HI> machinated to <HI>extort</HI> the submission of <HI>all</HI> the British Colonies to every parliamentary, or, what is synonimous, to every ministerial mandate,
<PB N="4" REF="014351_0003_0F91ECFB98D42BB0"/>
though ever so ruinous! But it may be predicted that, sooner or later, this act will have the intended effect, should its not appearing to press upon us <HI>in a direct manner,</HI> render us so inattentive, or so very selfish as to suffer its <HI>continuing</HI> to be enforced WITH IMPUNITY.</P>
<P>This introduction must point out to you, that the act, or rather edict here alluded to, is THAT, which was made <HI>for extending</HI> to <HI>all</HI> the British Colonies on this Continent, the acts of Parliament <HI>relating</HI> to mu∣tiny and desertion <HI>in Great Britain,</HI> as likewise, to maintain the discipline of <HI>his Majesty's army,</HI> so stiled, <HI>instead</HI> of its true <HI>descriptive</HI> name, <HI>the British,</HI> or <HI>National army</HI>:—An impropriety of the greatest im∣portance to a free people, justly jealous of their ho∣nour, and conscious of their real dignity! But, to the manifest danger of the national Liberty, this is little attended to, by military men; too many of whom, from a Field-Marshal to a drummer, <HI>mistake</HI> the true sense of that phraseology, which, when at first used, was meant but as a <HI>compliment,</HI> and appeared, as it really was, perfectly harmless, <HI>before</HI> our Kings kept a <HI>standing army.</HI> Erroneous notions on this head are now big with ruin, it being not unfrequent to find in the military order, a <HI>commissioned,</HI> as well as a <HI>non-commissioned</HI> varlet, ignorant enough to believe, that he <HI>eats</HI> the <HI>King's bread,</HI> and <HI>is bound,</HI> for that very reason, implicitly <HI>to obey any command</HI> he receives from his superiors, who <HI>eat</HI> the <HI>same</HI> bread! As men of this stamp never inquire with <HI>whose bread</HI> the King, himself, is fed, it is judged very necessary, at <HI>this</HI> critical juncture, to awake the attention and sensibility of many men of liberal principles, who serve in the <HI>British army</HI> and <HI>navy,</HI> some of whom in∣advertently <HI>mention</HI> the King, and even <HI>address</HI> him, as <HI>their master.</HI></P>
<P>The enemies to our constitution, well knowing the fatal effects of the illusion, which this old prejudice never fails to produce in the minds of the vulgar, sur∣reptitiously
<PB N="5" REF="014351_0004_0F91ECFC55A02200"/>
<HI>provided</HI> themselves with the <HI>extension edict,</HI> before [though <HI>not long before</HI>] the late Parliament issued their <HI>inquisitorial</HI> sentences against the people of the Massachusetts-Bay. That edict demonstrates to you, by what means the Ministry have determined to conduct their CONSPIRACY against our Liberty.— Surely, this is a <HI>grievance</HI> of the first magnitude!</P>
<P>The American news papers have informed you since that time, that Courts-Martial have dared to de∣cree <HI>various</HI> punishments, which have been <HI>inflicted</HI> on soldiers in America;—but, tho' such Courts Martial acted under colour of that same <HI>illegal</HI> edict▪ we do not learn that any of their members, or the deluded victims that became their accomplices, by executing the <HI>felonious</HI> sentences, have been indicted for their respective crimes! Nay, have not such unlawful Courts-Martial been suffered in our metropolis, to ex∣ercise the same illegal authority?</P>
<P>About the beginning of the last war, an Admini∣stration which had formed no design against our liberty, acted on very different principles, to prevent the mutiny and desertion of the <HI>British</HI> forces in North America! The minister sent circular directions to most of the American Governors, for procuring <HI>tem∣porary Acts,</HI> which, as they manifestly tended to the welfare and safety of the whole British empire, were cheerfully <HI>granted.</HI> The legislatures to which such applications were made, <HI>extended</HI> to their respective territories, the acts of Parliament for punishing mu∣tiny and desertion, &amp;c. Those acts, afterwards, <HI>re∣ceived</HI> the <HI>royal assent</HI>:—But the legal force of every such temporary act has long since expired. They were granted with the same caution, that acts of a similar nature pass in Great-Britain, where the Lords and Com∣mons know, that the national liberty might be easily destroyed, should they declare acts of such importance, PERPETUAL. The Legislature can give no <HI>lawful</HI> autho∣rity to such acts of <HI>perpetual</HI> duration, any more than they
<PB N="6" REF="014351_0005_0F91ECFD12ED0820"/>
can lawfully surrender the liberties of the people. These have, in reserve, an <HI>unalienable</HI> right to <HI>ratify,</HI> or <HI>annul,</HI> every act of their Delegates to legislative Assemblies.</P>
<P>The fair proceedings of the Administration above mentioned, are of public notoriety. They <HI>not only</HI> prove, in the most authentic manner, that Admini∣stration <HI>then believed</HI> the British Parliament had <HI>no right</HI> to bind us, in <HI>all cases whatsoever</HI>—but that <HI>the King and his Ministers</HI> were solicitous to demon∣strate the uprightness of their intentions—that they would <HI>not</HI> violate <HI>any</HI> of our <HI>constitutional</HI> rights, by attempting to bind us, in <HI>any case whatsoever, without</HI> our legal consent.</P>
<P>The Anti-British junto, being sensible the <HI>legal expiration</HI> of those <HI>temporary acts</HI> of the Colonies was an invincible obstacle to their projects of <HI>depredation,</HI> so artfully conducted themselves in, and out of Parli∣ament that their dark designs were not suspected. For this reason, the patriotic Minority, who did not think that more regiments were <HI>intended</HI> to be sent over to America, made little or no opposition to the extension edict.—This shows you, my brethren, how cautious you ought to be of your friends, themselves. They may be sincere—but, they do not feel!</P>
<P>Let us see now, what our late venerable Congress did for us—they who <HI>felt</HI> with us, the innumerable evils, that are inseparable from a standing army, <HI>not</HI> dependent on ourselves!—Their ninth resolve ex∣pressly declares, that to keep such army, is un∣lawful, and consequently proclaims the <HI>nullity</HI> of the <HI>extension edict,</HI> in the comprehensive words, which are prefixed to this address, although the <HI>consequence</HI> which results from the truth contained in them, being founded on the self-evident principles of universal jurisprudence, that respectable authority might have been omitted here, without the least danger. This consequence is ac∣knowledged by the uniform proceedings of every
<PB N="7" REF="014351_0006_0F91ECFDCB98F2C8"/>
civilized country relative to distributive justice, as well as in the judgment of every person, who is not in a state of insanity. <HI>Whatever is done anywhere against law, cannot be supported there, by law.</HI> It is a mere <HI>nullity.</HI></P>
<P>We have often been astonished at the superlative effrontery of ministerial hirelings; and yet, it is im∣probable any caviller of that tribe, will be so irreve∣rent and scurrilous as to urge, that the ninth resolve of the Congress does not affect the Extension Edict.— However, should you meet with that wretch, read to him, and intrench yourselves <HI>within</HI> the tenth resolve in their <HI>bill of rights,</HI> from which the following quo∣tation is inserted here, to support the ninth resolve, and several other parts of this Address; to wit,</P>
<P>"All and each of which," (that is to say, <HI>the rights mentioned in the nine preceding resolves,</HI>) <Q>the aforesaid Deputies in behalf of themselves, and their consti∣tuents, do claim, demand, and insist on, as their in∣dubitable Rights and Liberties; which cannot be le∣gally taken from them, altered or abridged by any power whatever, without their own consent, by their representatives, in their several Provincial Legislatures.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In the course of our enquiry we find many infringe∣ments and violations of the foregoing rights; which, from an ardent desire that harmony and a mutual intercourse of affection and interest may be restored, we pass over for the present, and proceed to state such acts and measures as have been adopted since the last war, which demonstrate a system formed to enslave America.</Q></P>
<P>Now, can a <HI>fair</HI> reasoner assert, that, notwithstand∣ing the <HI>declared illegality</HI> of the infringements alluded to in the preceding quotation, the declaration implies, that the Congress admitted the <HI>legal</HI> operation of any such act, <HI>till</HI> it should be <HI>repealed?</HI>—That it is to be so understood, though the whole of the proceedings
<PB N="8" REF="014351_0007_0F91ECFE8BA28400"/>
shows, that <HI>it is feared</HI> there will be <HI>a civil war, un∣less they be repealed</HI>?—Though the repeal be solicited, <HI>not to annul</HI> such acts, they being all <HI>illegal,</HI> and <HI>every one of them,</HI> whether <HI>enumerated or not,</HI> being conse∣quently <HI>null and void,</HI>—BUT "to restore harmony," <HI>that is,</HI> to <HI>prevent</HI> that civil war, which is justly <HI>feared, unless</HI> the violences which have been <HI>already</HI> commit∣ted, <HI>to enforce</HI> those <HI>unlawful, illegal,</HI> and NULL acts, be <HI>discontinued</HI>?</P>
<P>If those men, who solemnly appealing to God and the equity of mankind, for the justice of our cause, de∣clared to you and the other members of the British nation, that "to keep a Standing Army in these colo∣nies, without our consent," <HI>is against law,</HI> had justi∣fied the least suspicion of their admitting <HI>that it was not against law to punish, without our consent,</HI> mutiny and desertion in such <HI>unlawful</HI> Standing Army—Believe me, my dear, devoted coun∣try men, the most iniquitous Administration, that can be conceived—the <HI>present</HI> Administration itself, never would wish to obstruct their proceedings.</P>
<P>The Extension Act is <HI>unlawful, illegal</HI> and <HI>null,</HI> being made to support the discipline of an <HI>unlawful</HI> standing army: And should a standing army be made <HI>lawful</HI> in any colony, which God avert! the Extension Act would, nevertheless, remain <HI>unlawful, illegal,</HI> and <HI>null</HI> in that colony, until the legislature should have given it <HI>there,</HI> local <HI>lawfulness, legality,</HI> and therefore <HI>existence.</HI> But, you have do reason to fear this; for <HI>self-preservation</HI> will effectually prevent the most aban∣doned traitor from making a motion of that tendency, in any American legislative assembly, against the safe∣ty of a people, protected by the British constitution.</P>
<P>Regardless of every principle of justice and policy, the British Parliament are trying against our Liberty, experiments which, if hazarded against the people un∣der their immediate legislative authority, would infal∣libly involve Great-Britain in a civil war, and might
<PB N="9" REF="014351_0008_0F91ECFF4D1146A0"/>
produce <HI>another</HI> revolution there. The king is vest∣ed with the supreme command of all the forces of the nation, wherever they may be stationed; but he has no legal coercive authority any where, over the soldiers or sailors, otherwise than by local laws, made from time to time, to that effect. And, as the safety of every constitutional right depends on the limita∣tion of that authority, the other branches of the le∣gislature grant him but temporary acts, for maintain∣ing the discipline of the Army and Navy, by coercive laws, and for restraining or enlarging the power of Courts-Martial in both these departments, within the limits of that legislature by which they are granted.</P>
<P>The limited duration of those laws being as short as it appears from occasional circumstances, to be consis∣tent with public safety, the <HI>treasonable</HI> designs of Ad∣ministration may be counteracted with more facility, <HI>than</HI> if such laws were <HI>perpetual. After</HI> the legal expiration of those acts, the King's lawful authority over the national forces, expiring of course, can he <HI>punish,</HI> or <HI>detain</HI> any body in <HI>that</HI> service, since Courts-Martial are <HI>abolished</HI> by law, as they <HI>now</HI> are <HI>in the British Colonies</HI>? And, if the King would attempt to retain them in <HI>his own</HI> service, how could he accom∣plish it, before he had usurped an arbitrary power over the purses of the people?—Could he satisfy capricious demands, which would increase in pro∣portion to the knowledge that every man in <HI>his</HI> army and navy would have of the embarrassments of <HI>their master</HI>?—No—for, those salutary limitations are <HI>solely</HI> intended to preserve inviolate, our rights of opening or shutting up our purses, as we think fit. They have, till now, prevented such usurpations, which, to ex∣ercise with safety, is the ultimate end of <HI>every other</HI> usurpation that ever was exercised by any tyrant in the world.—It was but to attain <HI>that end,</HI> the <HI>selfish</HI> Parliament of Great-Britain have so flagitiously ex∣ceeded the limits of lawful power.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="014351_0009_0F91ED000CEB7AD8"/>If you admit as lawful, the extension illegally de∣creed by a ministerial Parliament, and machinated, but as a <HI>provisional edict,</HI> to insure the success of mea∣sures resolved on, relatively to the proscription of the Bostonians, and other proscriptions <HI>in petto.</HI> If you <HI>only</HI> tolerate its illegal operation any longer, the king will not experience those difficulties, which would thwart his arbitrary projects in Great Britain, were his usurpations to begin there. <HI>His</HI> Parliament might pay us the compliment of renewing the Extension, and other Temporary Acts of their own sole legis∣lation, for the sole purpose of raising a Revenue, to lighten their own burthens, which luxury and cor∣ruption have already prodigiously increased, and which your tameness will increase to a degree, which it is now beyond the power of calculators to ascertain.— But, you may rest assured that, in a very short time, Administration will sport with your Liberties, and soon after, with those of the whole British Empire.— The opprobrious and degrading denomination of <HI>pro∣vince,</HI> which now is but an innocent and unmeant mis∣application of a foreign word adopted in our lan∣guage, will significantly describe the real state of every British Colony, and indeed, of every shire in Great-Britain and Ireland!—Never forget that about two years ago, a Crowned Miscreant compelled the States of Sweden, the Parliament of that Country, to release him from his Coronation Oath! His success may tempt others to commit the same sacrilege.</P>
<P>Our enemies are now terrified at the superiority of strength, which the justice of our cause gives us over them, in the present contest. They will be amazed at the effect of their slimsey artifices, if, by tolerating the Extension Edict, we stupidly subject ourselves to a set of men, upon whom we can have no check;— who having exempted themselves and their tools, from the power of our tribunals, will drag before theirs, such of us, who may indicate the least inclina∣tion
<PB N="11" REF="014351_0010_0F91ED00CBD95340"/>
to a better change. Then, our disguised friends, and our open foes, united in the British Parliament, will, with iron hands and unfeeling hearts, "bind us in all cases whatsoever." We shall be in the condition of the Swedes, French, Spaniards, and most other na∣tions, where now and then, an honest man may regret the loss of his natural Rights, but where, an attempt to recover them would be next to madness.</P>
<P>It will be a melancholy reflection to us, perhaps for many years! that no strictures have yet been tender∣ed, respecting the destructive tendency of the Exten∣sion Edict. It is expected that the tried Patriotism of our ablest Writers will inspire them to hold it to public view, in its most minute circumstances. The silence now complained of dismays our friends, and secretly elates our enemies, on the other side of the water: It may, in some measure, exculpate the Ma∣gistrates and Grand Juries, who have not yet brought to justice, any of the persons who are liable to be prosecuted in their respective Districts, for crimes committed there, under the unlawful sanction of Par∣liamentary Edicts.</P>
<P>But, every such Edict, or illegal Act of Parliament, being void and null in law, respecting its operation amongst us, it clearly follows, That all the robberies and burglaries committed by Custom-house Officers and others, under colour of several Edicts of a simi∣lar nullity:—That all the murders and violences, perpetrated under the directions of illegal Courts-Martial.—That the oppression of the soldiers, who now are, legally, under the sole protection of the civil power of the British Colonies on this continent, where they are unlawfully stationed by a despotic Admini∣stration: And that, the enormities which Custom-house Officers, and illegal Courts of Admiralty or Vice-Admiralty, or which the deluded soldiery in the ministerial service, have already committed, or may hereafter commit, shall be wholly chargeable to the
<PB N="12" REF="014351_0011_0F91ED018B64BB98"/>
pusillanimous, or treasonable connivance of the Colo∣nists themselves, if such crimes remain unnoticed by those, whose sworn, and therefore, whose indispensa∣ble duty it is to bring them to light and trial.</P>
<P>O my countrymen! Will you cease to incur the contempt of the world? Will you no longer continue the jest of your enemies?—Listen no more to trem∣bling delinquents, who artfully whisper to you, that your Courts of Justice would quash such indict∣ments.—For God's sake! Do justice to the un∣derstanding and integrity of your Judges. Con∣sider, and you will clearly see that, were they as corrupt as we know them to be otherwise, they would not dare, at this juncture, to betray their in∣iquitous partiality. Nay, the most profligate mem∣ber of our Assembly, though he could depend on the concurrence of a majority, of the same corrupt principles, would not dare now, to abuse representa∣tion so far, as to move for a Bill, tending to skreen, directly or indirectly, under the illusory declaration of your assent, manifested by them only, <HI>any</HI> of the ob∣noxious Acts, which the late Congress reprobated, as demonstratory of "A system formed to enslave America.</P>
<P>Timid well-wishers to their country may object, that our zeal will be frustrated by an unprincipled Governor; that, not daring with a high hand, to im∣pede the prosecution of criminals, protected by him∣self, he will stretch prerogative, even to the pardon of <HI>irremissible</HI> crimes, none of which are more so than those, by which our sacred constitution is endangered. But, may not the well-known fate of a PORTEUS check traitors, by convincing them, that they cannot always shelter themselves under the wings of prerogative? And, should this prove ineffectual, our holy re∣ligion teaches us, that no worldly consideration ought to deter the just from doing his duty. Our committees, and what is much safer, Colonial Conventions, vested
<PB N="13" REF="014351_0012_0F91ED024C44E268"/>
with discretionary powers, will, at last, baffle the arts of ministerial tools, and work our political salvation.</P>
<P>If there be amongst us a conscientious lawyer, he certainly will point out to the officers of the unlawful standing army, stationed in the British colonies, the imminent danger they run, by detaining soldiers in North-America, under the illegal extension edict. As to pettifoggers, we know they are seduced by the pros∣pect of a plentiful harvest; and that, self-interest, not justice, determines them to act, whatever side they undertake to defend. If the minister do not value these enough to retain them in his service, for supporting the unlawful acts, they will, of course, rejoice at the almost innumerable actions of a civil nature, which may be grounded on the local nullity of parlia∣mentary edicts, and commenced by soldiers, for unjust detention, loss of time, and unpaid labour; or for various trespasses, unjustifiable before tribunals, which follow the British system of law.</P>
<P>All injuries sustained by any person in this colony, in consequence of the same unlawful sanction, may be redressed, and the same offences will be prevented for the future, if we have but sense and firmness enough to apply as we should, and where we should. It is ne∣ver too late to do our duty; let us trust the event to the omnipotent ruler of the universe, and he will reward our perseverance.</P>
<P>If through ignorance, or inattention, any of you ever gave a verdict, in contradiction to the fundamentals of justice; if he admitted the force of any act of Parlia∣ment, to which your own colonial laws have given no such force, that man must be very unhappy, whene∣ver he reflects on the injustice he has occasioned; but he is guiltless—he deserves compassion.—It is far diffe∣rent with jurymen, who knew the local nullity of acts of Parliament, and by their verdicts, authorised their illegal operation!—Those jurymen, and the judges who designedly suffered it—who have suppressed the
<PB N="14" REF="014351_0013_0F91ED030CFB74B0"/>
warnings and instructions which they ought to have given, and strengthened with their eloquence, have been bribed. Whether hope, feare avarice, or any other worldly motive influenced such judges and jury∣men—they have been <HI>bribed.</HI>—They stand <HI>guilty,</HI> be∣fore God and man, of wilful and corrupt perjury.</P>
<P>Do not believe, my dear countrymen, that infatuated as the junto may be, they hope that the Continental Association can be dissolved, by the external, the seem∣ing defection of any colony, were it even <HI>ours,</HI> which is nearly central, and the most liable to such suspicions. A Governor may bribe the majority of an assembly, who fancy that they represent a people, not virtuous enough to exercise their rights of choosing their re∣presentatives and elective officers, by ballot. Illegal warrants may be issued, and remain unquashed, for a considerable time, to bewilder the bulk of the people with the innumerable doubts, which, it is evident, will arise from the untried illegality of those proceed∣ings;—to intimidate and oppress, till the bench de∣termine the question;—and, in the mean while, to deter the injured from prosecuting such daring con∣spirators.</P>
<P>He may bribe a few trading justices, and seduce other sons of corruption and power, who hold, or expect to hold magistracy, or other offices, during pleasure, and are as much afraid of colonial conven∣tions, as the minister is of Continental Congresses:— But he cannot bribe the body of the people, in whom, originally, and finally, lies the sovereign power▪ re∣presented for their benefit only, by <HI>one</HI> single person.</P>
<P>All the Colonies, nay, the internal force of any single colony can punish a few venal officers, for abu∣sing the authority with which they are intrusted by their superiors, who are, themselves, subordinate to <HI>another</HI> superior, likewise intrusted by, and, as glori∣ous experience shows, accountable, as well as every one of his dependents, <HI>to the people</HI> at large, whether they
<PB N="15" REF="014351_0014_0F91ED03CBF76678"/>
meet in one single spot, or in their respective districts. The patriotic spirit of the American Britons cannot be subdued. They will exercise their constitutional right to hold conventions for their safety; a right, which cannot be questioned, without openly denying the legal title of the Hanoverian line of our Kings, to the British crown. Therefore, my dear countrymen, do not basely relinquish that sacred right, when you ought to exercise it. You know that, should you be oppres∣sed by a wicked knot of traitors, you will be delivered by your happier neighbours, as soon as their assistance is required.</P>
<P>The arch-fiend to our constitution knows all this: The Colonies which delegated members to the late Congress, have already appalled him, that insolent, cruel, and cowardly wretch, who, a year ago, decla∣red by his wicked trumpet, that he would not relent, "till he saw you prostrate at his feet!" Your Con∣gress made him stoop to proposals, which he well knows you will reject with disdain. He means but to divide and betray you, whom he despairs to subju∣gate by force. However, he will send more troops, more indeed, than he thinks it is prudent now to di∣vulge. But it is not solely in that reinforcement he confides. Will you believe it, my dear, devoted coun∣trymen, it is in his opinion of your folly! I shall re∣veal to you his grand secret— the only resource left him to extort your compliance.</P>
<P>Now that the vices of the nation have reduced to a state of impotence, the small portion of virtue which still remains in the British Parliament, he hopes that a superstitious reverence for that body, degenerate as it is, will continue to betray you into absurdities, and an in∣consistent passiveness! He still hopes that your <HI>inattenti∣on</HI> to the <HI>Extension Edict</HI> will enable him at last to defeat your united forces. Your supineness justifies him in believing, and persuading his associates, that you will always tolerate the operation of that destructive Edict,
<PB N="16" REF="014351_0015_0F91ED048B359548"/>
which is sufficient in itself, to put all the others in force.</P>
<P>Can we, without feeling the severest stings of self-reproach, reflect on the many crimes, which, since the Extension Act was quietly enforced, our inatten∣tion has emboldened Custom-house Officers, and other sons of tyranny to commit? Oh! had criminal prose∣cutions been instituted in that country, where the first felony, or the first degradation of human nature was committed, in defiance of our laws, and under the usurped authority of Courts-Martial, or rather, imme∣diately after their first unwarrantable sentence was known!—Had soldiers been duly protected against their tyrannical masters, robberies and murders might have been prevented; our brethren at BOSTON could not be dragooned; we might long ago have de∣fied the combinations of the parricidal junto, whose aim is to destroy our constitution!—We should no longer fear their dethroning our King, and fixing his Crown on the head of a race of tyrants, whom a pa∣triotic Parliament justly proscribed, about ninety years ago, as irreconcileable foes to the natural rights of the British Nation! With truth and security we might tell the arch-fiend "What do you think of Venal Parliaments NOW?"</P>
<P>Since no sophistry can delude an incorrupted Ame∣rican Jury; since the joint efforts of the Ministerial hirelings cannot, without our connivance, hold up be∣fore the eyes of the soldiers, the veil which hides from them the knowledge of their civil rights, let us instruct those deluded victims; let us openly protect them against their oppressors. If we adopt this paci∣fie mode of resistance, which no political casu∣ist, who has subscribed to the revolution Creed, can disapprove, the minister may send over as many regi∣ments as he pleases; the intended instruments of our ruin will but add to our strength add prosperity. As soon as they know it is against law to detain
<PB N="17" REF="014351_0016_0F91ED054B6F5A58"/>
them in the army, the ministerial army, there will be no obstacle to their desertion. Then, but not be∣fore, Sycophants, paid to calumniate and betray the British colonies, will in vain attempt to persuade the instructed, and less credulous soldiers, that we shall deliver them up to facilitate our reconciliation with the British Parliament, who will not hear of any proposal of accommodation, unless this, their <HI>sine qua non</HI> condition, be first complied with. If we adopt this generous measure, we shall enjoy the purest pleasure that can affect freemen—that of res∣cuing our fellow creatures, our brethren, from dis∣graceful bondage. And, if experience can teach us wisdom, we shall so cautiously grant temporary acts, for preventing mutiny and desertion, should ever the safety of the British Empire make it again necessary to grant such acts, that the abominable project of re∣ducing us into a state of Slavery, by the means of a standing army, cannot enter the head of any fu∣ture minister.</P>
<P>The virtuous part of the British Officers, them∣selves, impatiently wait for this manifestation of our prudence. They will secretly rejoice, as Britons, at the mutiny and desertion of whole Battalions, what∣ever they may do in their public character, to the contrary. And General Gage, whom his weakness and incapacity recommended to a perfidious Admini∣stration, who emulously extol his abilities, though they would not have employed him, if a sensible man of an established military reputation, had accepted the dishonourable command—That General, whom they have decorated but as a bound victim, may be brought to justice, and answer for the many crimes, which his thirst of power, inspired him to perpetrate, or patro∣nise, as the most acceptable offerings, which could pro∣pitiate to him his tutelar Deity at St. James's.</P>
<P>It is not yet too late to pursue this plan of philan∣thropy and self-defence; but we must exert ourselves

with activity and constancy. If we lose time, the soldiers, not knowing the local nullity of an Edict, made for the purpose of detaining them against law, on an unnatural service which they abhor, will be afraid of being treacherously delivered up, in case they desert. They will not cease to be awed by illegal Courts-Martial, though if they were proper∣ly instructed, they would not fear, but despise the authority usurped by those Courts; and the soldiers who have been injured by them, or by any military officer, would obtain legal redress, should they make proper application.</P>
<P>If we suffer them to be misled by a sacrilegious in∣terpretation of their military oath, from which they are released as soon as the army is kept against law: If we scandalously forsake them, in vain shall we cry out to them, in the strain of the Roman Patriot,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Quò quò Scelesti ruitis?</L>
