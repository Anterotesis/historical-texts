<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>A BOOK without a preface is like a face without a nose. Let the other features be ever so agreeable and well poportioned, it is looked on with detestation and horror if this material ornament be wanting.</P>
<P>Or rather, a book is like a house: The grand portico is the dedication; the flagged pavement is an humble address to the reader, in order to <HI>pave</HI> the way for a kind reception of the work; the front door with its fluted pillars, pediment, trigliffs and modillions are the title page with its motto, author's name and titles, date of the year, &amp;c. The entry is the preface (oftentimes of a tedious length) and the several apartments and closets are the chapters and sections of the work itself.</P>
<P>As I am but a clumsy carpenter at best, I shall not attempt to decorate my little cottage with any <HI>out of door</HI> ornaments; but as it would be inconvenient and uncomfortable to have my front door open immediately into the apartments of my house, I have made this pre∣face by way of entry.</P>
<P>And now, gentle reader, if you should think my entry too plain and simple you may set your
<PB REF="013339_0003_0F8FFC44C6352068"/>
imagination to work, and furnish it with a grand staircase, with cornices, stucco and paint∣ings. That is, you may suppose that I entered very unwillingly upon this work, being compel∣led to it by a chain of unforeseen circumstances: That it was written in the midst of a great hurry of other business, and under particular disadvantages of time and place, and that it was only intended for the inspection of a few friends, without any expectations of ever seeing it in the Press.</P>
<P>You may, kind reader, go on to suppose that when my friends perused my work, they were struck with the energy of my genius, and insisted that the public ought not to be deprived of such a fund of amusement and improvement through my obstinate modesty; and that after many soli∣citations and powerful persuasions I had been prevailed upon to bless mankind with the fruits of my labour.</P>
<P>Or, if you like not this, you may suppose that the following sheets were found in the cabinet of some deceased gentleman; or that they were dug out of an ancient ruins, or discovered in a Her∣mit's Cave, or dropped from the clouds in a hail storm. In short, you may suppose just what you please. And when, by the help of imagination, you have seasoned the preface to your palate, you may turn over this leaf, and feast upon the body of the work itself.</P>

<HEAD>A PRETTY STORY.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>ONCE upon a time, a great while ago, there lived a certain Nobleman, who had long possessed a very valua∣ble farm, and had a great number of children and grandchildren.</P>
<P>BESIDES the annual profits of his land, which were very considerable, he kept a large shop of goods; and being very success∣ful in trade, he became, in process of time, exceeding rich and powerful; insomuch that all his neighbours feared and respected him.</P>
<P>WITH respect to the management of his family, it was thought he had adopted the most perfect mode that could be devised, for he had been at the pains to examine the oeco∣nomy of all his neighbours, and had select∣ed from their plans all such parts as appear∣ed to be equitable and beneficial, and omit∣ted those which from experience were found
<PB N="6" REF="013339_0005_0F90552AA82924A8"/>
to be inconvenient. Or rather, by blend∣ing their several constitutions together he had so ingeniously counterbalanced the evils of one mode of government with the bene∣fits of another, that the advantages were richly enjoyed, and the inconveniencies scarcely felt. In short, his family was thought to be the best ordered of any in his neighbourhood.</P>
<P>HE never exercised any undue authority over his children or servants; neither in∣deed could he oppress them if he was so dis∣posed; for it was particularly covenanted in his marriage articles that he should not at any time impose any tasks or hardships whatever upon his children without the free consent of his wife.</P>
<P>NOW the custom in his family was this, that at the end of every seven years his mar∣riage became of course null and void; at which time his children and grandchildren met together and chose another wife for him, whom the old gentleman was obliged to marry under the same articles and restricti∣ons as before. If his late wife had conduct∣ed herself, during her seven years marriage, with mildness, discretion, and integrity, she was re-elected; if otherwise, deposed: By which means the chidren had always a
<PB N="7" REF="013339_0006_0F90552D24723728"/>
great interest in their mother in law; and through her, a reasonable check upon their father's temper. For besides that he could do nothing material respecting his children without her approbation, she was sole mis∣tress of the purse strings; and gave him out, from time to time, such sums of money as she thought necessary for the expences of his family.</P>
<P>BEING one day in a very extraordinary good humour, he gave his children a writ∣ing under his hand and seal, by which he released them from many badges of depen∣dance, and confirmed to them several very important privileges. The chief were the two following, viz. That none of his chil∣dren should be punished for any offence, or supposed offence, until his brethren had first declared him worthy of such punishment; and secondly, he gave fresh assurances that he would impose no hardships upon them without the consent of their mother in law.</P>
<P>THIS writing, on account of its singular importance, was called THE GREAT PAPER. After it was executed with the utmost so∣lemnity, he caused his Chaplain to publish a dire <HI>Anathema</HI> against all who should attempt to violate the articles of the <HI>Great Paper,</HI> in the words following.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="013339_0007_0F90552D9B676568"/>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>NOW it came to pass that this Noble∣man had, by some means or other, obtained a right to an immense tract of wild uncultivated country at a vast distance from his mansion house. But he set little store by this acquisition, as it yielded him no pro∣fit, nor was it likely to do so, being not only difficult of access on account of the dis∣tance, but was also overrun with innume∣rable wild beasts very fierce and savage; so that it would be extremely dangerous to at∣tempt taking possession of it.</P>
<P>IN process of time, however, some of his children, more stout and enterprising than the rest, requested leave of their father to go and settle on this distant tract of land. Leave was readily obtained; but before they set out certain agreements were stipulated be∣tween them—the principal were—the old Gentleman, on his part, engaged to protect and defend the adventurers in their new set∣tlements; to assist them in chacing away the wild beasts, and to extend to them all the benefits of the government under which they were born: Assuring them that al∣though they should be removed so far from his presence they should nevertheless be con∣sidered
<PB N="10" REF="013339_0009_0F90553073DDAA08"/>
as the children of his family, and treated accordingly. At the same time he gave each of them a bond for the faithful performance of these promises; in which, among other things, it was covenanted that they should, each of them in their several fa∣milies, have a liberty of making such rules and regulations for their own good govern∣ment as they should find convenient; pro∣vided these rules and regulations should not contradict or be inconsistent with the gene∣ral standing orders established in his farm.</P>
<P>IN return for these favours he insisted that they, on their parts, should at all times ac∣knowledge him to be their father; that they should not deal with their neighbours with∣out his leave, but send to his shop only for such merchandize as they should want. But in order to enable them to pay for such goods as they should purchase, they were permitted to sell the produce of their lands to certain of his neighbours.</P>
<P>THESE preliminaries being duly adjust∣ed, our adventurers bid adieu to the com∣forts and conveniencies of their father's house, and set off on their journey.—Many and great were the difficulties they encoun∣tered on their way: But many more and much greater had they to combat on their
<PB N="11" REF="013339_0010_0F9055309CF61BB8"/>
arrival in the new country. Here they found nothing but wild nature. Mountains overgrown with inaccessible soliage, and plains steeped in stagnated waters. Their ears are no longer attentive to the repeated strokes of industrious labour, and the busy hum of men, instead of these, the roaring tempest and incessant howlings of the beasts of prey fill their minds with horror and dis∣may. The needful comforts of life are no longer in their power—no friendly roof to shelter them from inclement skies; no for∣tress to protect them from surrounding dangers. Unaccustomed as they were to hardships like these, some were cut off by sickness and disease, and others snatched away by the hands of barbarity. They be∣gan however, with great perseverance, to clear the land of encumbering rubbish, and the woods resound with the strokes of la∣bour; they drain the waters from the sedged morass, and pour the sun beams on the reek∣ing soil; they are forced to exercise all the powers of industry and oeconomy for bare subsistence, and like their first parent, when driven from Paradise, to earn their bread with the sweat of their brows. In this work they were frequently interrupted by the in∣cursions of the wild beasts, against whom they defended themselves with heroic prow∣ess and magnanimity.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="013339_0011_0F90553160990050"/>AFTER sometime, however, by dint of indefatigable perseverance, they found them∣selves comfortably settled in this new farm; and had the delightful prospect of vast tracts of land waving with luxuriant harvests, and perfuming the air with delicious fruits, which before had been a dreary wilderness, unfit for the habitation of men.</P>
<P>IN the mean time they kept up a constant correspondence with their father's family, and at a great expence provided waggons, horses and drivers to bring from his shop such goods and merchandize as they wanted, for which they paid out of the produce of their lands.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P>NOW the new settlers had adopted a mode of government in their several families similar to that their father had esta∣blished in the old farm; in taking a new wife at the end of certain periods of time; which wife was chosen for them by their children, and without whose consent they could do nothing material in the conduct of their affairs. Under these circumstances they thrived exceedingly, and became very numerous; living in great harmony amongst
<PB N="13" REF="013339_0012_0F905532813E92B0"/>
themselves, and in constitutional obedience to their father and his wife.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING their successful pro∣gress, however, they were frequently annoy∣ed by the wild beasts, which were not yet expelled the country; and were moreover troubled by some of their neighbours who wanted to drive them off the land, and take possession of it themselves.</P>
<P>TO assist them in these difficulties, and protect them from danger, the old Noble∣man sent over several of his servants, who with the help of the new settlers drove away their enemies. But then he required that they should reimburse him for the expence and trouble he was at in their behalf; this they did with great chearfulness, by applying from time to time to their respective wives, who always commanded their cash.</P>
<P>THUS did matters go on for a considerable time, to their mutual happiness and benefit. But now the Nobleman's wife began to cast an avaricious eye upon the new settlers; saying to herself, if by the natural conse∣quence of their intercourse with us my wealth and power are so much increased, how much more would they accumulate if I can persuade them that all they have be∣longed
<PB N="14" REF="013339_0013_0F905533D0C716F8"/>
to us, and therefore I may at any time demand from them such part of their earnings as I please. At the same time she was fully sensible of the promises and agree∣ments her husband had made when they left the old farm, and the tenor and purport of the <HI>great paper.</HI> She therefore thought it necessary to proceed with great caution and art, and endeavoured to gain her point by imperceptible steps.</P>
<P>IN order to this, she first issued an edict setting forth, That whereas the tailors of her family were greatly injured by the people of the new farm, inasmuch as they presu∣med to make their own clothes whereby the said tailors were deprived of the benefit of their custom; it was therefore ordained that for the future the new settlers should not be permitted to have amongst them any shears or scissars larger than a certain fixed size. In consequence of this, our adven∣turers were compelled to have their clothes made by their father's tailors: But out of regard to the old gentleman, they patiently submitted to this grievance.</P>
<P>ENCOURAGED by this success, she pro∣ceeded in her plan. Observing that the new settlers, were very fond of a particular kind of cyder which they purchased of a
<PB N="15" REF="013339_0014_0F9055345A52C8E8"/>
neighbour who was in friendishp with their father (the apples proper for making this cyder not growing on their own farm) she published another edict, obliging them to pay her a certain stipend for every barrel of cyder used in their families! To this like∣wise they submitted: Not yet seeing the scope of her designs against them.</P>
<P>AFTER this manner she proceeded, im∣posing taxes on them on various pretences, and receiving the fruits of their industry with both hands. Moreover she persuaded her husband to send amongst them from time to time a number of the most lazy and useless of his servants, under the specious, pretext of defending them in their settlements and of assisting to destroy the wild beasts; but in fact to rid his own house of their com∣pany, not having employment for them; and at the same time to be a watch and a check upon the people of the new farm.</P>
<P>IT was likewise ordered that these pro∣tectors as they were called, should be sup∣plied with bread and butter cut in a parti∣cular form: But the head of one of the fa∣milies refused to comply with this order. He engaged to give the guests, thus forced upon him, bread and butter sufficient; but insisted that his wife should have the liberty of cutting it in what shape she pleased.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="013339_0015_0F90553745F51DB0"/>THIS put the old Nobleman into a vio∣lent passion, insomuch that he had his son's wife put into gaol for presuming to cut her loaf otherwise than as had been directed.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>AS the old Gentleman advanced in years he began to neglect the affairs of his family, leaving them chiefly to the management of his steward. Now the steward had debauched his wife, and by that means gained an entire ascendancy over her. She no longer deliberated what would most benefit either the old farm or the new; but said and did whatever the steward pleased. Nay so much was she in∣fluenced by him that she could neither utter <HI>Ay</HI> or <HI>No</HI> but as he directed. For he had cunningly persuaded her that it was very fashionable for women to wear padlocks on their lips, and that he was sure they would become her exceedingly. He therefore fast∣ened a padlock to each corner of her mouth; when the one was open, she could only say <HI>Ay</HI>; and when the other was loosed, could only cry <HI>No.</HI> He took care to keep the keys of these locks himself; so that her will became entirely subject to his power.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="013339_0016_0F90553761D34D40"/>NOW the old Lady and the steward had set themselves against the people of the new farm; and began to devise ways and means to impoverish and distress them.</P>
<P>THEY prevailed on the Nobleman to sign an edict against the new settlers, in which it was declared that it was their duty as children to pay something towards the sup∣plying their fathers table with provisions, and to the supporting the dignity of his fa∣mily; for that purpose it was ordained that all their spoons, knives and forks, plates and porringers, should be marked with a certain mark, by officers appointed for that end; for which marking they were to pay a cer∣tain stipend: and that they should not, un∣der severe penalties, presume to make use of any spoon, knife or fork, plate or porringer, before it had been so marked, and the said stipend paid to the officer.</P>
<P>THE inhabitants of the new farm began to see that their father's affections were alie∣nated from them; and that their mother was but a base mother-in-law debauched by their enemy the steward. They were thrown into great confusion and distress. They wrote the most supplicating letters to the old Gentleman, in which they acknow∣ledged him to be their father in terms of the
<PB N="18" REF="013339_0017_0F90553911612C48"/>
greatest respect and affection—they recount∣ed to him the hardships and dfficulties they had suffered in settling his new farm; and pointed out the great addition of wealth and power his family had acquired by the im∣provement of that wilderness; and shewed him that all the fruits of their labours must in the natural course of things unite, in the long run, in his money box. They also, in humble terms reminded him of his pro∣mises and engagements on their leaving home, and of the bonds he had given them; of the solemnity and importance of the <HI>Great Paper</HI> with the curse annexed. They acknowledged that he ought to be reimburs∣ed the expences he was at on their account, and that it was their duty to assist in support∣ing the dignity of his family. All this they declared they were ready and willing to do; but requested that they might do it agreea∣ble to the purport of the <HI>Great Paper,</HI> by ap∣plying to their several wives for the keys of their money boxes and furnishing him from thence; and not to be subject to the tyran∣ny and caprice of an avaricious mother-in-law, whom they had never chosen, and of a steward who was their declared enemy.</P>
<P>SOME of these letters were intercepted by the steward; others were delivered to the old Gentleman, who was at the same time
<PB N="19" REF="013339_0018_0F905539A1EB9800"/>
persuaded to take no notice of them; but, on the contrary, to insist the more strenu∣ously upon the right his wife claimed of marking their spoons, knives and forks, plates and porringers.</P>
<P>THE new settlers observing how matters were conducted in their father's family be∣came exceedingly distressed and mortified. They met together and agreed one and all that they would no longer submit to the ar∣bitrary impositions of their mother-in-law, and their enemy the steward. They deter∣mined to pay no manner of regard to the new decree, considering it as a violation of the <HI>Great Paper.</HI> But to go on and eat their broth and pudding as usual. The cooks also and butlers served up their spoons, knives and forks, plates and porrin∣gers without having them marked by the new officers.</P>
<P>THE Nobleman at length thought fit to reverse the order which had been made re∣specting the spoons, knives and forks, plates and porringers of the new settlers. But he did this with a very ill grace: for he, at the same time avowed and declared that he and his wife had a right to mark all their furniture, if they pleased, from the silver tankard down to the very chamber pots: that as he was their father he had an abso∣lute
<PB N="20" REF="013339_0019_0F90553A5D718578"/>
controul over them, and that their li∣berties, lives, and properties were at the en∣tire disposal of him and his wife: that it was not fit that he who was allowed to be <HI>omni∣present, immortal,</HI> and <HI>incapable of error,</HI> should be confined by the shackles of the <HI>Great Paper</HI>; or obliged to fulfil the bonds he had given them, which he averred he had a right to cancel whenever he pleased.</P>
<P>HIS wife also became intoxicated with vanity. The steward had told her that she was an <HI>omnipotent</HI> Goddess, and ought to be worshipped as such: that it was the height of impudence and disobedience in the new settlers to dispute her authority, which with respect to them, was unlimited: that as they had removed from their father's family, they had forfeited all pretensions of being consi∣dered as his children, and lost the privileges of the <HI>Great Paper</HI>: that, therefore, she might look on them only as tenants at will upon her husband's farm, and exact from them what rent she pleased.</P>
<P>ALL this was perfectly agreeable to Ma∣dam, who admitted this new doctrine in its full sense.</P>
<P>THE people of the new farm however took little notice of these pompous declara∣tions.
<PB N="21" REF="013339_0020_0F90553B1DF3D4D8"/>
They were glad the marking decree was reversed, and were in hopes that things would gradually settle into their former channel.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<P>IN the mean time the new settlers increased exceedingly, and as they increased, their dealings at their father's shop were propor∣tionably enlarged.</P>
<P>IT is true they suffered some inconvenien∣cies from the protectors that had been sent amongst them, who became very trouble∣some in their houses: They seduced their daughters; introduced riot and intemperance into their families, and derided and insulted the orders and regulations they had made for their own good government. Moreover the old Nobleman had sent amongst them a great number of thieves, ravishers and murderers, who did a great deal of mischief by practising those crimes for which they had been banished the old farm. But they bore these grievances with as much patience as could be expected; not chosing to trou∣ble their aged father with complaints, unless in cases of important necessity.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="013339_0021_0F90553BF05371D8"/>NOW the steward continued to hate the new settlers with exceeding great hatred, and determined to renew his attack upon their peace and happiness. He artfully in∣sinuated to the old Gentleman and his fool∣ish wife, that it was very mean and unbe∣coming in them to receive the contributi∣ons of the people of the new farm, towards supporting the dignity of his family, through the hands of their respective wives: that upon this footing it would be in their pow∣er to refuse his requisitions whenever they should be thought to be unreasonable, of which they would pretend to be judges themselves; and that it was high time they should be compelled to acknowledge his ar∣bitrary power, and his wife's <HI>Omnipotence.</HI></P>
<P>FOR this purpose, another decree was prepared and published, ordering that the new settlers should pay a certain stipend up∣on particular goods, which they were not allowed to purchase any where but at their father's shop; and that this stipend should not be deemed an advance upon the original price of the goods, but be paid on their ar∣rival at the new farm, for the express pur∣pose of supporting the dignity of the old Gentleman's family, and of defraying the expences he affected to afford them.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="013339_0022_0F90553D5E479258"/>THIS new decree gave our adventurers the utmost uneasiness. They saw that the steward and their mother-in-law were de∣termined to oppress and enslave them. They again met together and wrote to their fa∣ther, as before, the most humble and per∣suasive letters; but to little purpose: A deaf ear was turned to all their remonstran∣ces; and their dutiful requests treated with contempt.</P>
<P>FINDING this moderate and decent con∣duct brought them no relief, they had re∣course to another expedient. They bound themselves in a solemn engagement not to deal any more at their father's shop until this unconstitutional decree should be re∣versed; which they declared to be a viola∣tion of the <HI>Great Paper.</HI></P>
<P>THIS agreement was so strictly adhered to, that in a few months the clerks and ap∣prentices in the old Gentleman's shop began to make a sad outcry. They declared that their master's trade was declining exceed∣ingly, and that his wife and steward would, by their mischievious machinations, ruin the whole farm; they forthwith sharpened their pens and attacked the steward, and even the old Lady herself with great severity. Inso∣much that it was thought proper to with∣draw
<PB N="24" REF="013339_0023_0F90553D811D1090"/>
this attempt likewise upon the rights and liberties of the new settlers. One part only of the new decree remained unrevers∣ed—viz. the tax upon <HI>Water Gruel.</HI></P>
<P>NOW there were certain men on the old farm who had obtained from the Nobleman an exclusive right of selling <HI>Water Gruel.</HI> Vast quantities of this <HI>Gruel</HI> were vended amongst the new settlers; for it became very fashionable for them to use it in their families in great abundance. They did not however trouble themselves much about the tax on <HI>Water Gruel</HI>: they were well pleas∣ed with the reversal of the other parts of the decree, and considering <HI>Gruel</HI> as not abso∣lutely necessary to the comfort of life, they were determined to endeavour to do without it, and by that means avoid the remaining effects of the new decree.</P>
<P>THE steward found his designs once more frustrated; but was not discouraged by this disappointment. He formed ano∣ther scheme so artfully contrived that he thought himself sure of success. He sent for the persons who had the sole right of vending <HI>Water Gruel,</HI> and after reminding them of the obligations they were under to the Nobleman and his wife for their ex∣clusive privilege, he desired that they would
<PB N="25" REF="013339_0024_0F90553E1A61FF70"/>
send sundry waggon loads of <HI>Gruel</HI> to the new farm, promising that the accustomed duty which they paid for their exclusive right should be taken off from all the <HI>Gruel</HI> they should send amongst the new settlers: And that in case their cargoes should come to any damage, he would take care that the loss should be repaired out of the old Gentleman's coffers.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Gruel</HI> merchants readily consented to this proposal, knowing that if their car∣goes were sold, they would reap considera∣ble profits; and if they failed, the steward was to make good the damage. On the other hand the steward concluded that the new settlers could not resist purchasing the <HI>Gruel</HI> to which they had been so long ac∣customed; and if they did purchase it when subject to the tax aforesaid, this would be an avowed acknowledgment on their parts that their father and his wife had a right to break through the tenor of the <HI>Great Paper,</HI> and to lay on them what impositions they pleased, without the consent of their respective wives.</P>
<P>BUT the new settlers were well aware of this decoy. They saw clearly that the <HI>Gruel</HI> was not sent to accommodate, but to enslave them; and that if they suffered any
<PB N="26" REF="013339_0025_0F9055409938B5F8"/>
part of it to be sold amongst them, it would be deemed a submission to the assumed <HI>Om∣nipotence</HI> of the <HI>Great Madam.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<P>ON the arrival of the <HI>Water Gruel,</HI> the people of the new farm were again thrown into great alarms and confusions. Some of them would not suffer the waggons to be unloaded at all, but sent them imme∣diately back to the <HI>Gruel</HI> merchants: others permitted the waggons to unload, but would not touch the hateful commodity; so that it lay neglected about their roads and high∣ways until it grew sour and spoiled. But one of the new settlers, whose name was <HI>Jack,</HI> either from a keener sense of the inju∣ries attempted against him, or from the ne∣cessity of his situation, which was such that he could not send back the <HI>Gruel</HI> be∣cause of a number of mercenaries whom his father had stationed before his house to watch and be a check upon his conduct: he, I say, being almost driven to dispair, fell to work, and with great zeal stove to pieces the casks of <HI>Gruel,</HI> which had been sent him, and ut∣terly demolished the whole cargoe.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="013339_0026_0F905541D4C98C68"/>THESE proceedings were soon known at the old farm. Great and terrible was the uproar there. The old Gentleman fell in∣to great wrath, declaring that his absent children meant to throw off all dependence upon him, and to become altogether diso∣bedient. His wife also tore the padlocks from her lips, and raved and stormed like a Billinsgate. The steward lost all patience and moderation, swearing most prophanely that he would leave no stone unturned 'till he had <HI>humbled the settlers of the new farm at his feet,</HI> and caused their father to trample on their necks. Moreover the <HI>Gruel</HI> mer∣chants roared and bellowed for the loss of their <HI>Gruel</HI>; and the clerks and apprentices were in the utmost consternation lest the people of the new farm should again agree to have no dealings with their father's shop. —Vengeance was immediately set on foot particularly against <HI>Jack.</HI> With him they determined to begin; hoping that by mak∣ing an example of him they should so terri∣fy the other families of the new settlers, that they would all submit to the designs of the steward, and the <HI>Omnipotence</HI> of the old Lady.</P>
<P>A VERY large <HI>Padlock</HI> was, accordingly, prepared to be fastened upon <HI>Jack's</HI> great gate; the key of which was to be given to
<PB N="28" REF="013339_0027_0F905541F078B4E8"/>
the old Gentleman; who was not to open it again until he had paid for the <HI>Gruel</HI> he had spilt, and resigned all claim to the privi∣leges of the <HI>Great Paper</HI>: nor then neither unless he thought fit. Secondly, a decree was made to new model the regulations and oeconomy of <HI>Jack's</HI> family in such man∣ner that they might for the future be more subject to the will of the steward: and, thirdly, a large gallows was erected before the mansion house in the old farm, and an order made that if any of <HI>Jack's</HI> children or servants should be suspected of misbehaviour, they should not be convicted or acquitted by the consent of their brethren, agreeable to the purport of the <HI>Great Paper,</HI> but be tied neck and heels and dragged to the gallows at the mansion house, and there be hanged withot mercy.</P>
<P>NO sooner did tidings of this undue seve∣rity reach the new farm, but the people were almost ready to dispair. They were altogether at a loss how to act, or by what means they should avert the vengeance to which they were doomed: but the old La∣dy and steward soon determined the matter▪ for the <HI>Padlock</HI> was sent over, and without ceremony fastened upon <HI>Jack</HI>'s great gate. They did not wait to know whether he would pay for the <HI>Gruel</HI> or not, or make the requir∣ed
<PB N="29" REF="013339_0028_0F905542A49BE320"/>
acknowledgments; nor give him the least opportunity to make his defence— The great gate was locked, and the key given to the old Nobleman, as had been determined.</P>
<P>POOR <HI>Jack</HI> found himself in a most de∣plorable condition. The great inlet to his farm was entirely blocked up, so that he could neither carry out the produce of his land for sale, nor receive from abroad the necessaries for his family.</P>
<P>BUT this was not all—His father, along with the <HI>Padlock</HI> aforesaid, had sent an over∣seer to hector and domineer over him and his family; and to endeavour to break his spirit by exercising every possible severity: for which purpose he was attended by a great number of mercenaries, and armed with more than common authorities.</P>
<P>ON his first arrival in <HI>Jack</HI>'s family he was received with considerable respect, be∣cause he was the delegate of their aged fa∣ther: for, notwithstanding all that had past, the people of the new settlements loved and revered the old Gentleman with a truly fi∣lial attachment: attributing his unkindness entirely to the intrigues of their enemy the steward. But this fair weather did not last
<PB N="30" REF="013339_0029_0F9055437358CA68"/>
long. The new overseer took the first op∣portunity of shewing that he had no inten∣tions of living in harmony and friendship with the family. Some of <HI>Jack</HI>'s domes∣ticks had put on their Sunday clothes, and attended the overseer in the great parlour, in order to pay him their compliments on his arrival, and to request his assistance in reconciling them to their father: but he rudely stopped them short in the midst of their speech; called them a parcel of disobe∣dient scoundrels, and bid them go about their business. So saying, he turned upon his heel, and with great contempt left the room.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<P>NOW <HI>Jack</HI> and his family finding themselves oppressed, insulted, and tyrannised over in the most cruel and arbi∣trary manner, advised with their brethren what measures should be adopted to relieve them from their intolerable grievances. Their brethren, one and all, united in sym∣pathising with their afflictions; they advis∣ed them to bear their sufferings with forti∣tude for a time, assuring them that they looked on the punishments and insults laid
<PB N="31" REF="013339_0030_0F905544274F08B8"/>
upon them with the same indignation as if they had been inflicted on themselves, and that they would stand by and support them to the last. But, above all, earnestly recom∣mended it to them to be firm and steady in the cause of liberty and justice, and never ac∣knowledge the <HI>Omnipotence</HI> of their mother-in-law; nor yield to the machinations of their enemy the steward.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, lest <HI>Jack</HI>'s family should suffer for want of necessaries, their great gate being fast locked, liberal and very generous contributions were raised among the several families of the new settlements for their pre∣sent relief. This seasonable bounty was handed to <HI>Jack</HI> over the garden wall—all ac∣cess to the front of his house being shut up.</P>
<P>NOW the overseer observed that the chil∣dren and domesticks of <HI>Jack</HI>'s family had frequent meetings and consultations toge∣ther; sometimes in the garret, and some∣times in the stable: understanding, like∣wise, that an agreement not to deal in their father's shop, until their grievances should be redressed, was much talked of amongst them, he wrote a thundering prohibition, much like a Pope's Bull, which he caused to be pasted up in every room of the house: in which he declared and protested that these
<PB N="32" REF="013339_0031_0F8FFC48056C4E40" MS="y"/>
meetings were treasonable, traiterous, and rebellious; contrary to the dignity of their father, and inconsistent with the <HI>Omnipo∣tence</HI> of their mother-in-law: denouncing also terrible punishments against any two of the family who should from thenceforth be seen whispering together, and strictly forbidding the domesticks to hold any more meetings in the garret or stable.</P>
<P>THESE harsh and unconstitutional pro∣ceedings irritated <HI>Jack</HI> and the other inha∣bitants of the new farm to such a degree that</P>
