<HEAD>By a Friend, in Commendation of these <HI>Poems.</HI></HEAD>
<L>MY Muse is dull, although I have a will</L>

<L>I know not how its worth for to declare,</L>
<L>Few <HI>Poems</HI> doubtless, with it compare;</L>
<L>Not for rare elegent Scholastik strains,</L>
<L>Which flow alone from those quick witted brains▪</L>
<L>Who with their Rhetorick and curious Art</L>
<L>Strive to effect the fancy, not the Heart.</L>
<L>This <HI>Treatise</HI> read (kind Friend) and thou shalt see,</L>
<L>'Tis cheifly fill'd with choice Divinity,</L>
<L>The Author soars on high, his main design</L>
<L>Is to instruct that precious Soul of thine</L>
<L>I'th' path Caelestial, shews thee very plain,</L>
<L>How thou in Christ an Int'rest may'st obtain,</L>
<L>Or i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in Christ thy Soul has got a place,</L>
<L>He, to thy Joy, shews forth thy happy case;</L>
<L>This <HI>Poem's</HI> like a messenger sent forth,</L>
<L>To give a visit to the drouzy Earth;</L>
<L>The sluggish Soul it strives for to awake,</L>
<L>Before it drops into the fiery Lake.</L>
<L>There's very few on Earth do live,</L>

<HEAD>To the Reader; in Vindication of this Book.</HEAD>
<L>ONe or two lines to thee I'll here Commend,</L>
<L>This honest POEM to defend</L>
<L>From Calumny, because at this day,</L>
<L>All Poetry there's many do gain-say,</L>
<L>And very much condemn, as if the same</L>
<L>Did worthily deserve reproach and blame.</L>
<L>If any Book in Verse, they chance to spy,</L>
<L>Away Prophane, they presently do cry:</L>
<L>But tho' this kind of Writing some dispraise,</L>
<L>Sith Men so captious are in these our days;</L>
<L>Yet I dare say, how e'er the scruple rose,</L>
<L>Verse hath express'd as secret things as Prose.</L>
<L><PB REF="001207_0005_0FB1330EC5B8C478"/>Though some there be that Poetry abuse,</L>
<L>Must we therefore, not the same method use?</L>
<L>Yea, sure, for of my Conscience 'tis the best,</L>
<L>And doth deserve more honour then the rest:</L>
<L>For 'tis no humane knowledge gain'd by Art,</L>
<L>But rather 'tis inspir'd into the Heart</L>
<L>By Divine means; for true Divinity</L>
<L>Hath with this Science great Affinity:</L>
<L>Though some through Ignorance, do it oppose,</L>
<L>Many do it esteem, far more then Prose:</L>
<L>And find also that unto them it brings</L>
<L>Content, and hath been the delight of Kings.</L>
<L><HI>David,</HI> altho' a King, yet was a Poet,</L>
<L>And <HI>Solomon</HI> also, the Scriptures show it.</L>
<L>Then what if for all this some should abuse it?</L>
<L>I'me apt to think that Angels do embrace it,</L>
<L>And though God giv't here but in Part to some,</L>
<L>Saints shall hav't perfect in the World to come.</L>

<L>THe Sun doth now begin to shine,</L>

<L>As when the chirping Birds do sing;</L>

<L>There was no Spark nor Light in me.</L>
<L>My Spring it was the Winter-time,</L>

<L>The Sun was gone out of my Clime,</L>
<L>And also I do now remember</L>
<L>My heart was cold like any stone,</L>

<L>God is a Sun, a shield also,</L>

<L>And shineth in our Horizon,</L>
<L>To th' clearing of the cloudy Skies!</L>
<L>The misty Fogs by this strong Light</L>

<L>The light from darkness clearly part,</L>
<L>And makes in me rare shining days.</L>
<L>Though fogs appear and clouds do rise,</L>

<L>What dark confusion would be here!</L>
<L>If God should quite the Sun remove,</L>
<L>How would the Sea-man do to steer!</L>
<L>My Soul's the World, and Christ's the Sun,</L>

<L>No wicked or malicious men could ever</L>

<L>It turns them from those cursed ways of sin,</L>

<L>And did affirm it was made up with Lyes.</L>
<L>Yet has it made them howl at last, and cry,</L>
<L><HI>We are undone to all ETERNITY.</HI></L>
<L>'Twas like unto the writing on the VVall,</L>
<L>VVhich did fore-tell profane <HI>Belshazzer's</HI> fall</L>
<L>VVhich was so terrible, yea, and so strange,</L>

<L>But an Interpreter; his heart did burn,</L>
<L>His tremling knees smote one against another,</L>
