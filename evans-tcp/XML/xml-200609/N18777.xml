<HEAD>MISCELLANEOUS ESSAYS.</HEAD>
<P>☞ THE author used to amuse himself with writing, occasional∣ly, little essays for the <HI>Pennsylvania Magazine,</HI> published at Phila∣delphia in the years 1775 and 1776, by Mr. <HI>Robert Ait<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en.</HI> The following are some of his contributions to that work.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="essay">
<HEAD>TO THE PUBLISHER OF THE PENNSYLVANIA MAGAZINE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS much pleased when I heard of your in∣tention to publish a Magazine o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Monthly Miscella∣ny. For you must know, Mr. Aitken, that I have long had an earnest desire to appear as an author before the respectable public. When I walk out a∣lone, which I frequently do, observations and senti∣ments arise in my mind, which appear to me as wise and important as many of those which the press is continually obtruding upon the public notice.</P>
<P>TRUE it is, I have never yet been able to collect
<PB N="2" REF="024407_0006_0FC70B0E68E68CF0"/>
a sufficient number of these bright ideas to form a regular piece of composition: but I had great hopes, that if a proper occasion should offer, I might be able to furnish a short essay upon some subject or other.</P>
<P>YOU may wonder, perhaps, why I have not tri∣ed my hand in some of the public newspapers; but the truth is, that what with your <HI>Citizens,</HI> your <HI>Philadelphians,</HI> your <HI>Lovers of Liberty,</HI> your <HI>Mode∣rate Men,</HI> and your <HI>Immoderate Men,</HI> there is no getting a word or two in, edge-ways, amongst them. Now, I look upon your proposed magazine as a pleasant little path, where a man may take an agreeable walk with a few orderly and agreeable friends, without the danger of being jostled to death in a crowd.</P>
<P>I DETERMINED, therefore, to make my appear∣ance in your first number; and, for this purpose, I sat whole hours alone in my chamber: I took solitary walks, and implored every muse to assist me.—But all in vain.—Those hard-hearted god∣desses were deaf to my earnest invocations, and absolutely refused to attend me, either in their bet∣termost suits of flowing rhyme, or in their common dress of home-spun prose.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="024407_0007_0FC70B102BB85260"/>THE first important difficulty I met with was the choice of a subject; much fruitless time was wasted in this pursuit. The whole train of sciences passed in review before me; I chose, and rejected, my choice; I determined, and altered lay determi∣nation; so many enticing objects courted my atten∣tion, that fancy hovered over them like a bird, un∣determined where to settle.</P>
<P>Having, one evening, wearied myself with this mental exercise, I retired to rest. During the si∣lent hours of night, when the powers of my soul, no longer subjected to the directions of my will, were resigned to the influences of the spiritual world, I was entertained with the following very EXTRAORDINARY DREAM.</P>
<P>I FOUND myself in a place where a thick fog surrounded me, and screened every object from my view. The exerted powers of vision could extend no farther than a few yards round me.</P>
<P>AT length I perceived a dense and sutty cloud, gradually descend and rest before me. I attended its motions with earnest application. I observed that it boiled in circling eddies, and laboured with in∣testine conflict; it burst with a peal of thunder, and
<PB N="4" REF="024407_0008_0FC70B15EDBFF9A0"/>
vanished in thin air: and I saw an angelic form of exquisite beauty standing before me. She was clad in flowing robes, white as the new fallen snow, and was invested with an atmosphere of lambent glory. She addressed me in words to this effect:
<Q>Happy art thou, oh mortal! and highly favoured in this interview! I am TRUTH; and as thou art in the earnest pursuit of knowledge, I am come to impress upon thy mind, by sensible objects, a comprehensive view of human wisdom.</Q>
Say∣ing this, she waved her right hand, and the fog dispersed. I then perceived that I was standing on a beautiful eminence, which commanded an unin∣terrupted view of a very extensive garden. Three sides of this garden were bounded by a lofty and substantial wall; the fourth was washed by the wa∣ters of the ocean.</P>
<P><Q>WHAT thou seest before thee, (said my divine companion,) <HI>is the garden of human knowledge.</HI> It is surrounded by a high wall, because the wis∣dom of finite beings must be finite; and it lies on the banks of the ocean of <HI>eternity.</HI> You may observe, that it has but one gate, leading into a long and narrow <HI>path,</HI> on which nothing grows but a few nutritious fruits and salutary herbs. After this, innumerable walks and alleys branch
<PB N="5" REF="024407_0009_0FC70B181F2B37B0"/>
out, directing to the several departments of the garden.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I SEE your eyes are fixed upon that remarka∣ble tree in the middle of this spacious garden. It does indeed make a very singular appearance now; but it was once the glory of the whole scene. It is the tree of <HI>religion,</HI> and its fruit is the most delicious and salutary that can be found in the whole garden. The folly of mankind hath reduced it to the deplorable situation in which you now see it. Some thought its branches were too large, and spread too far: and lest their shade should stint the growth of the paltry weeds they had planted under them, they lopt off many of them close to the stock. Others, on the con∣trary, concluded that, as it was so beneficial a tree, there could not be too much of it, and therefore permitted the suckers to grow round its roots; and moreover, brought cions from other trees and grafted them on the stock. Some learned botanists insisted that all the virtues of this tree were contained in the fruit, and would have all the leaves stripped off, as being of no use; whilst others, as learned, contended, that if the leaves were preserved, it signified nothing whether it bore fruit or not. Thus by their se∣veral <HI>systems</HI> and <HI>improvements,</HI> they would re∣duce
<PB N="6" REF="024407_0010_0FC70B19A5D0B9A0"/>
it to a mutilated, useless, and deformed trunk.</Q></P>
<P><Q>TURN your attention now to yonder labyrinth. That is the LAW department in the garden of knowledge. In the centre stands an elegant statue of <HI>Justice:</HI> but the ways that lead to it are so intricate, and the paths so narrow and inter∣woven with each other, that by the time those who reach it have got half through the puzzle, they become more anxious to find their way back than to proceed. For you must know, that the alleys are formed by stone walls and wooden fences stuck full with nails and tenter-hooks; so that, if the bold adventurer should even reach the statue, he gets there in a most ragged, and, sometimes, naked condition. Moreover, the en∣trances to all these paths and alleys were much encumbered with weeds, brush, and thorns; but a celebrated modern <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Blackstone.</NOTE> hath taken the pains to clear away a great deal of the rubbish, and has drawn a plan of the several windings and intrica∣cies of this labyrinth for the benefit of mankind, yet the tenter-hooks remain in the walls as nume∣rous as ever.</Q></P>
<P><Q>YONDER large department is the district of
<PB N="7" REF="024407_0011_0FC70B1C143C5410"/>
PHYSIC. It abounds, indeed, with a great varie∣ty of medicinal herbs and plants; but the mis∣fortune is, that the misapplication of their powers and qualities by unskilful pretenders, hath been the source of much misery to mankind. Add to this, that the affectation of pomp and mystery, and the fopperies of fashion, have too frequently rendered this important branch of knowledge ridiculous in the eye of truth.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THAT secluded corner,
<L>'Dark with the cedar grove;</L>
<L>'Where fragrant spices bloom,</L>
<L>'And amorous turtles love</L>
<L>'Beneath the pleasing gloom,'</L>
is devoted to the fine arts, PAINTING, POETRY, MUSIC, &amp;c. It was once enriched with a great profusion of fruits and flowers of exquisite scent and varied hues: but these have long since been gathered by the artists of former days. It is kept, however, in neat order, and furnishes many gay garlands and agreeable nosegays. It must be owned too, that a modern poet <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Shakespeare.</NOTE> cultivated here a number of flowers and ever-greens, with uncommon success.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="024407_0012_0FC70B2711F45810"/>HERE I interrupted my kind instructor, by ask∣ing, what that strange looking place, near the walls of the garden, might signify.</P>
<P><Q>THAT place, (said she) is a swamp, overgrown with briars and thorns. It is the department of LOGIC; and the most useless and untoward spot in the whole garden of knowledge. Neverthe∣less, there are not wanting some who take delight in cultivating it. You see what odd nooks and angles form the outward boundaries; and the in∣ternal parts are also cut by a thousand crooked paths, turning and winding, dividing and subdi∣viding, and all to no purpose.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE proprietors of this swamp have, in vain, endeavoured to drain it, as it lies lower than all the neighbouring ground. They have, however, somewhat improved it by shutting up the most useless paths, and throwing bridges and cause-ways over the marshy places. They have been pleased to dedicate their labours to me; but I should be sorry if any of my votaries should so far mispend their time, as to seek for me amidst the trifling intricacies of that barren place.</Q></P>
<P><Q>NEAR to this swamp you see METAPHYSICS; but this department lies so close to the wall
<PB N="9" REF="024407_0013_0FC70B28BAD59D70"/>
which bounds all human knowledge, and is so shadowed thereby, that it produces very few plants whose virtues can be depended upon. The labourers in this ground are continually endea∣vouring to make peep-holes through the wall, by which they may discover the adjacent country: but the materials of which that wall is made are too hard to yield to any tools they can work with.</Q></P>
<P>HERE my divine instructor turned to me, and said:
<Q>I would willingly point out to you the situ∣ation and destination of all the other parts of the garden; but I perceive that by the natural course of your constitution, your spirit will soon be again subject to your will, and of consequence plunged in the vortex of the busy world. I hasten, therefore, to communicate to you some very important intelligence, respecting both the spiritual and material kingdoms. Truths be∣yond the reach of human investigation, which will tend to enlarge your mind, and give you the most exalted ideas of the Omnipotent Author of nature.</Q></P>
<P><Q>ALL that extensive part of the garden which is bounded by the ocean, is assigned for the several branches of NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. You may
<PB N="10" REF="024407_0014_0FC70B2A1D43D628"/>
observe, that a great<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>deal of it is beneficially cul∣tivated, but much the greatest part of it remains yet unexplored. By the study of natural philo∣sophy and astronomy men acquire some know∣ledge of the oeconomy of the <HI>Great Supreme.</HI> In some instances demonstration and fact confirm the truths discovered; but, in others, fanciful hypotheses are substituted for truth, and errors become sanctified by system, and habitual by edu∣cation. My present design is to remove some of these prejudices from your mind, and to en∣rich your understanding with <HI>true philosophy.</HI></Q></P>
<P>"KNOW, then, and observe it well, that"—At this instant, my servant knocked at my chamber-door, and told me that the barber waited for me. Think, Mr. Aitken, what a mortifica∣tion it was to me to be so unseasonably interrupted, when I was just going to receive the secrets of na∣ture from the lips of truth. Instead of conversing further with that divine personage, I was obliged to attend the impatience of Mons. le Friseur; who, without ceremony began to smeer my face with nasty soap-suds. I heartily wished him in the ocean of eternity.</P>
<P>I MUST not forget, however, to tell you, that in a pleasant corner of the garden of knowledge,
<PB N="11" REF="024407_0015_0FC70B2BB9850960"/>
I saw a neat little fountain of simple architecture, from which issued several streams of pure water. On a handsome pediment in the front of this foun∣tain I saw inscribed THE PENNSYLVANIA M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>GA∣ZINE.</P>

<HEAD>For the Pennsylvania Magazine. AN IMPROVED PLAN OF EDUCATION.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are few objects in life of greater im∣portance than the proper culture and instruc∣tion of those who must in time supply the places of the present generation.</P>
<P>VERY arduous is the task of education, both to the industrious teacher and his assiduous disciples. What thanks then will be due to him who shall contribute any thing towards rendering the road to science easy and pleasant, or shorten the tedious length of the journey.</P>
<P>MANY schemes have been formed by ingenious men for this good purpose, in which they have endeavoured to blend the <HI>utile</HI> with the <HI>dulce,</HI> in so intimate a connection, that the pupil becomes insensibly instructed, whilst he thinks he is only a∣musing himself.</P>
<P>AS I am quite disposed to allow every person the praise due to his ingenuity, I readily acknow∣ledge the usefulness of their several devices: such
<PB N="13" REF="024407_0017_0FC70B3335545418"/>
as teaching <HI>geography</HI> by maps pasted on thin boards, and cut into pieces, according to the divi∣sions of counties or kingdoms: <HI>commerce,</HI> by a te-to-tum: <HI>history</HI> and <HI>chronology,</HI> by a pack of cards: and <HI>Euclid's elements,</HI> by figures cut out of box-wood, with many other similar inventions, by which science is planted in the minds of youth by the fair hand of innocent pleasure.</P>
<P>THE improvement I have made on this idea, ap∣pears to me so important, that I cannot forbear of∣fering it to the public for general use; heartily re∣commending my plan to the trustees of our college, and to the patronage of the legislature. I have, here∣in, not only united instruction with delight, but added also the invaluable blessing of <HI>health</HI>; making these desireable acquisitions to go hand in hand, mutually improving and strengthening both mind and body, by one amusing process.</P>
<P>IN order to execute my plan, it will be necessary to purchase about twenty acres of level ground, which must be well cleared of all incumbrances; and, if laid out in a circular form, it may be called the <HI>whole circle of sciences.</HI></P>
<P>TO begin with <HI>grammar,</HI> which costs the poor boys much trouble and painful attention: I beg
<PB N="14" REF="024407_0018_0FC70B34A71347D8"/>
leave to quote a passage from a late humorous no∣vel; from which, I must in justice acknowledge, I took the hint of my improved plan of education. The passage I allude to is this.</P>
<P>"HERE, <HI>Jackey,</HI> let the gentleman <HI>see</HI> you de∣cline the pronoun article <HI>hic, haec, hoc.</HI> Master Jackey immediately began hopping about the room, repeating <HI>hic, haec, hoc;</HI> genitive, <HI>hujus,</HI> dative, <HI>huic;</HI> uccusative, <HI>hunc, haec, hoc;</HI> vocative, <HI>caret;</HI> ablative, <HI>hoc, haec hoc.</HI> There now, says <HI>Selkirk,</HI> in this manner I teach him the whole grammar. I make eight boys represent the eight parts of speech. The <HI>noun substantive</HI> stands by himself; the <HI>adjec∣tive</HI> has another boy to support him; the <HI>nomina∣tive case</HI> carries a little wand before the <HI>verb;</HI> the <HI>accusative case</HI> walks after and supports his train; I let the <HI>four conjugations</HI> make a party at whist, and the <HI>three concords</HI> dance the hay together, and so on."</P>
<P>BY this contrivance, the common exercise of <HI>hop-step</HI> and <HI>jump</HI> is rendered truly grammatical, and the head and the heels are improved by one operation.</P>
<P>IN like manner, may the young scholar be in∣structed in <HI>arithmetic,</HI> by the healthful play of
<PB N="15" REF="024407_0019_0FC70B3B0260EAD0"/>
<HI>hop-scot;</HI> wherein certain squares are delineated on the ground, and each superscribed with numerical figures: the dexterity consists in hopping about on one foot, and kicking a piece of potsherd or oyster∣shell into such squares as shall produce the greatest amount of figures.</P>
<P>IT is easy to see that in such a commodious piece of ground the several branches of mathematics, as <HI>trigonometry, surveying, navigation,</HI> &amp;c. may be ac∣quired by actual exercise, in a mode very amusing to the student.</P>
<P><HI>NATURAL philosophy</HI> may also be taught by the sports in common use amongst boys. The <HI>vis iner∣tiae</HI> of matter, <HI>elasticity,</HI> and the general laws of <HI>motion</HI> may be evidenced in playing <HI>marbles, fives,</HI> and <HI>bandy-wicket.</HI> The doctrine of projectiles, the accelerated velocity of falling bodies, and the <HI>pa∣rabolic curve,</HI> the <HI>centrifugal force,</HI> and the laws of <HI>gravitation,</HI> may be understood by shooting arrows, slinging stones, and throwing snow-balls. <HI>Pneu∣matics</HI> will be taught in the use of the <HI>pop-gun,</HI> flying of kites, blowing bladders, and lifting stones with a piece of wet leather and string: and <HI>hydrostatics</HI> may be illustrated by the <HI>squirt</HI> and other aquatic amusements.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="024407_0020_0FC70B3C401397A0"/>A SUFFICIENT knowledge of <HI>logic</HI> may be acqui∣red by the same healthful and entertaining means. Let a large boy represent the <HI>major proposition;</HI> a small boy the <HI>minor;</HI> and a middle sized lad the <HI>conclusion</HI>: and let these three play at <HI>hide and seek.</HI> A <HI>sorites</HI> may be very aptly represented by <HI>thread my needle nan;</HI> and a <HI>dilemma</HI> by <HI>blind buck and Davy.</HI> Every species of syllogisms may be exem∣plified by devices of the like kind.</P>
<P>THUS far the common sports of boys may be made the vehicles of instruction; but some ingenu∣ity on the part of the tutor will be requisite to teach them <HI>moral philosophy</HI> and <HI>astronomy.</HI> In order to the first, I would propose that the several <HI>passions</HI> and <HI>affections</HI> of the mind be represented by as many boys, each of whom should have his destined course and distance assigned by the tutor, who should himself represent <HI>reason.</HI> These boys should all be blindfolded, and started as for a race; and whilst they are running, <HI>helter-skelter,</HI> in full ca∣reer, the tutor should exert himself with great vociferation to direct them to keep in their several courses: calling out to one to stop, to another to to push forward, and to all of them not to jostle or interfere with each other. It would be proper that the stoutest and most active boys should personate the <HI>passions,</HI> and that the cooler <HI>affections</HI> of the
<PB N="17" REF="024407_0021_0FC70B3DAADF43F8"/>
mind should be assigned to the young, weak, and tardy. Large stumbling-blocks should also be pla∣ced at the end of their respective courses, which will probably break the shins of those who attempt to pass their limits, and will give some idea of the office of <HI>conscience:</HI> and it would be better still, if an impetuous disciple, blundering over his stum∣bling-block, should find himself entangled amongst briars and thorns, previously disposed for the pur∣pose. The head-scholar should be seated on high as judge of the race, representing the <HI>understand∣ing:</HI> and the strongest lad start the racers, emble∣matical of the <HI>will.</HI></P>
<P>TO teach <HI>astronomy,</HI> it will be necessary to make use of the whole twenty acres of ground: which must be divided by concentric circles, at proportio∣nal distances, for the orbits of the planets. Let the tutor place himself as the sun, in the centre: the larger boys representing the primary planets, and the small ones attending them as satellites. The tutor, by the help of a speaking trumpet, must direct them how to perform their several revolutions in due order of time and place; which cannot fail giving these peripatetic philosophers a competent idea of the solar system.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="024407_0022_0FC70B3F9F9F8908"/>THIS is my proposed plan of education, and I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of seeing it put in practice.</P>
<P>WHAT a glorious entertainment must it be to <HI>see</HI> a whole school of boys practising and actually performing their several exercises. Some <HI>hopping</HI> over a grammar lesson; <HI>stepping</HI> by mood and tense, and <HI>jumping</HI> over nouns and pronouns, verbs and adverbs? If the young student should happen to lean too much on one side, he may be said to be <HI>declining;</HI> and if he should actually fall, he will probably be in the <HI>vocative.</HI> There is no lover of learning but must be delighted with such an ex∣hibition.</P>

<HEAD>CONSOLATION FOR THE OLD BACHELOR.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A paper, under the title of <HI>The Old Bachelor,</HI> had been insti∣tuted in the Pennsylvania Magazine.</NOTE></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. Aitken,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR <HI>Old Bachelor</HI> having pathetically re∣presented the miseries of his solitary situation, se∣verely reproaching himself for having neglected to marry in his younger days; I would fain alle∣viate his distress, by shewing that it is <HI>possible</HI> he might have been as unhappy—even in the honour∣able state of matrimony.</P>
<P>I am a shoemaker in this city, and by my indus∣try and attention have been enabled to maintain my wife and a daughter, now six years old, in comfort and respect; and to lay by a little at the year's end, against a rainy day.</P>
<P>MY good wife had long teased me to take her to New York, in order to visit <HI>Mrs. Snip,</HI> the la∣dy of an eminent taylor in that city, and her cou∣sin; from whom she had received many pressing invitations.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="024407_0025_0FC70B4EE64FC128"/>THIS jaunt had been the daily subject of discus∣sion at breakfast, dinner, and supper for a month before the time fixed upon for putting it in execu∣tion. As our daughter <HI>Jenny</HI> could by no means be left at home, many and great were the prepa∣tions to equip Miss and her Mamma for this impor∣tant journey; and yet, as my wife assured me, there was nothing provided but what was <HI>absolute∣ly necessary,</HI> and which we could not possibly do without—My purse sweat at every pore.</P>
<P>AT last, the long expected day arrived, preceded by a very restless night. For, as my wife could not sleep for thinking on the approaching jaunt, nei∣ther would she suffer me to repose in quiet. If I happened through wearisomeness to fall into a slumber, she immediately roused me by some un∣seasonable question or remark: frequently ask∣ing if I was sure the apprentice had greased the chair-wheels, and seen that the harness was clean and in good order; often observing how surprised her cousin Snip would be to see us; and as often wondering how poor dear Miss <HI>Jenny</HI> would bear the fatigue of the journey—Thus past the night in delightful discourse, if that can with propriety be called a discourse, wherein my wife was the only speaker—my replies never exceeding the mo∣nosyllables
<PB N="22" REF="024407_0026_0FC70B5064C86990"/>
<HI>yes</HI> or <HI>no,</HI> murmured between sleeping and waking.</P>
<P>NO sooner was it fair day-light, but up started my notable wife, and soon roused the whole fami∣ly. The little trunk was stuffed with baggage, even to bursting, and tied behind the chair, and the chair-box was crammed with trumpery which <HI>we could not possibly do without.</HI> Miss <HI>Jenny</HI> was drest, and breakfast devoured in haste: the old ne∣gro wench was called in, and the charge of the house committed to her care; and the two appren∣tices and the hired maid received many whole∣some cautions and instructions for their conduct during our absence, all which they most liberally promised to observe; whilst I attended, with infi∣nite patience, the adjustment of these preliminaries.</P>
<P>AT length, however, we set off, and, turning the first corner, lost sight of our habitation, with great regret on my part, and no less joy on the part of Miss <HI>Jenny</HI> and her Mamma.</P>
<P>WHEN we got to Poole's Bridge, there hap∣pened to be a great concourse of waggons, carts, &amp;c. so that we could not pass for some time— Miss <HI>Jenny</HI> frightened—my wife very impatient and uneasy—wondered I did not call out to those
<PB N="23" REF="024407_0027_0FC70B51DEDE1D68"/>
impudent fellows to make way for us; observing that I had not the spirit of a louse. Having got through this difficulty, we proceeded without ob∣struction—my wife in good humour again—Miss <HI>Jenny</HI> in high spirits. At <HI>Kensington</HI> fresh trou∣bles arise—Bless me, Miss <HI>Jenny,</HI> says my wife, where is the band-box? I don't know, Mamma; the last time I saw it, it was on the table in your room—What's to be done? the band-box is left behind—it contains Miss <HI>Jenny's</HI> new wire-cap— there is no possibility of doing without it—As well no New York as no wire-cap—there is no alternative, we must e'en go back for it. Teased and mortified as I was, my good wife administer∣ed consolation by observing,
<Q>That it was my business to see that every thing was put into the chair that ought to be, but there was no depend∣ing upon me for any thing; and that she plainly saw I undertoook this journey with an ill-will, merely because she had set her heart upon it.</Q>
Silent patience was my only remedy. An hour and an half restored to us this essential requisite—the wire-cap, and brought us back to the place where we first missed it.</P>
<P>AFTER innumerable difficulties and unparalleled dangers, occasioned by ruts, stumps, and tremen∣dous bridges, we arrived at Neshamony ferry: but
<PB N="24" REF="024407_0028_0FC70B57E09C34A0"/>
how to cross it was the question. My wife pro∣tested that neither she nor <HI>Jenny</HI> would go over in the boat with the horse. I assured her that there was not the least danger; that the horse was as quiet as a dog, and that I would hold him by the bridle all the way. These assurances had little weight: the most forcible argument was that she must go that way or not at all, for there was no other boat to be had. Thus persuaded, she ventured in—The flies were troublesome—the horse kicked—my wife in panics—Miss <HI>Jenny</HI> in tears.—<HI>Ditto</HI> at <HI>Trenton-ferry.</HI></P>
<P>AS we started pretty early, and as the days were long, we reached Trenton by two o'clock. Here we dined. My wife found fault with every thing; and whilst she disposed of what I thought a tolera∣ble hearty meal, declared there was nothing fit to eat. Matters, however, would have gone on pret∣ty well, but Miss <HI>Jenny</HI> began to cry with the tooth-ach—sad lamentations over Miss <HI>Jenny</HI>—all my fault, because I had not made the glazier re∣place a broken pane in her chamber window. N. B. I had been twice for him, and he promised to come, but was not so good as his word.</P>
<P>AFTER dinner we again entered upon our jour∣ney—my wife in good humour—Miss <HI>Jenny's</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="024407_0029_0FC70B5C1E62C730"/>
tooth-ache much easier—various chat—I acknow∣ledge every thing my wife says for fear of dis∣composing her. We arrive in good time at <HI>Princetown.</HI> My wife and daughter admire the College. We refresh ourselves with tea, and go to bed early, in order to be up by times for the next day's expedition.</P>
<P>IN the morning we set off again in tolerable good humour, and proceeded happily as far as <HI>Rocky-hill.</HI> Here my wife's fears and terrors re∣turned with great force. I drove as carefully as possible; but coming to a place where one of the wheels must unavoidably go over the point of a small rock, my wife, in a great fright, seized hold of one of the reins, which happening to be the wrong one, she pulled the horse so as to force the wheel higher up the rock than it would otherwise have gone, and overset the chair. We were all tumbled <HI>hickledy-pickledy,</HI> into the road—Miss <HI>Jenny's</HI> face all bloody—the woods echo to her cries—my wife in a fainting fit—and I in great mi∣sery; secretly and most devoutly wishing cousin <HI>Snip</HI> at the devil. Matters begin to mend—my wife recovers—Miss <HI>Jenny</HI> has only received a slight scratch on one of her cheeks—the horse stands quite still, and none of the harness broke. Mat∣ters grew worse again; the twine with which the
<PB N="26" REF="024407_0030_0FC70B60DDC039E8"/>
band-box was tied had broke in the fall, and the aforesaid wire-cap lay soaking in a nasty mud-puddle—grievous lamentations over the wire-cap —all my fault because I did not tie it better—no remedy—no wire-caps to be bought at <HI>Rocky-hill.</HI> At night my wife discovered a small bruise on her hip—was apprehensive it might mortify—did not know but the bone might be broken or splintered— many instances of mortifications occasioned by small injuries.</P>
<P>AFTER passing unhurt over the imminent dangers of <HI>Passayack</HI> and <HI>Hackensack</HI> rivers, and the yet more tremendous horrors of <HI>Pawlas-hook</HI> ferry, we arrived, at the close of the third day, at cou∣sin <HI>Snip's</HI> in the city of New York.</P>
<P>HERE we sojourned a tedious week; my wife spent as much money as would have maintained my family for a month at home, in purchasing a hundred useless articles <HI>which we could not possibly do without;</HI> and every night when we went to bed fatigued me with encomiums on her cousin <HI>Snip</HI>; leading to a history of the former grandeur of her family, and concluding with insinuations that I did not treat her with the attention and re∣spect I ought.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="024407_0031_0FC70B64F0D59E10"/>ON the seventh day my wife and cousin <HI>Snip</HI> had a pretty warm altercation respecting the com∣parative elegancies and advantages of New York and Philadelphia. The dispute ran high, and ma∣ny aggravating words past between the two advo∣cates. The next morning, my wife declared that my business would not admit of a longer absence from home—and so after much ceremonious com∣plaisance, in which my wife was by no means ex∣ceeded by her very polite cousin, we left the fa∣mous city of New York; and I with heart-felt satisfaction looked forward to the happy period of our safe arrival in Water-street, Philadelphia.</P>
<P>BUT this blessing was not to be obtained with∣out much vexation and trouble—but lest I should seem tedious I shall not recount the adventures of our return—how we were caught in a thunder storm—how our horse failed, by which we were benighted three miles from our stage—how my wife's panics returned—how Miss <HI>Jenny</HI> howled, and how very miserable I was made. Suffice it to say, that, after many distressing disasters, we arrived at the door of our own habitation in Wa∣ter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>street.</P>
<P>NO sooner had we entered the house, but we were informed that one of my apprentices had
<PB N="28" REF="024407_0032_0FC70B6627E40170"/>
ran away with the hired-maid, no body knew where; the old negro had got drunk, fallen into the fire, and burnt out one of her eyes; and our best china-bowl was broken.</P>
<P>MY good wife contrived, with her usual inge∣nuity, to throw the blame of all these misfortunes upon me. As this was a consolation to which I had been long accustomed in all untoward cases, I had recourse to my usual remedy, viz. silent pa∣tience. After sincerely praying that I might ne∣ver more see cousin <HI>Snip,</HI> I sat industriously down to my trade, in order to retrieve my manifold losses.</P>
<P>THIS is only a miniature picture of the married state, which I present to your <HI>Old Bachelor,</HI> in hopes it may abate his choler, and reconcile him to a single life. But, if this opiate should not be suffi∣cient to give him some ease, I may, perhaps, send him a stronger dose hereafter.</P>

<HEAD>THE OLD BACHELOR, N<SUP>o</SUP> VI.</HEAD>
<P>—OH, that I had been made an oyster!— that I had been stationed in the bottom of the sea —the winds might have blown and swelled the waves mountains high; I should not have heeded them. Mankind might have satiated themselves with folly, iniquity and deceit; it would not have troubled me. But, what is better than all, I should have propagated my species by a numerous off∣spring, without the cares, without the plagues, without the expences of a female assistant.</P>
<P>HERE some journeyman philosopher would interrupt me with a learned dissertation on sexes; and prove, by a chain of irrefragible sup∣positions, that oysters are male and female.— What's that to you, sir? Who asked your opinion? The deuce is in these coxcombs, that they cannot let a man go on in his own way, but they must be throwing straws across his path.—Go, Mr. Philo∣sopher, go, catch butterflies, and search for the pineal gland of a musketoe.</P>
<P>OH, that I had been an oyster!—'Tis true I should not have known what are called the
<PB N="30" REF="024407_0034_0FC70B6925F233F0"/>
joys of life; that is, I should not have eaten turtle-soup and venison till I nauseated both, nor have drank Madeira till I loathed it.—True,—neither should I be tormented with the treachery of ser∣vants, the hypocrisy of relations, or the insults and sarcasms of my fellow oysters.</P>
<P>YOU should have heard from me before this, Mr. Aitken, but I have been sick, very sick,—al∣most at the point of death; I caught cold by put∣ting on a damp shirt.—If I had been married, my wife, perhaps, would have taken care that my linen should have been well aired—perhaps not. Be this as it may, I caught cold, and was very sick. Nobody troubled their heads about me; I lay helpless, languishing and neglected above; my servants rioted and plundered below; every thing ran into confusion. The common comforts of the sick were not administered to me; I lay many hours alone, brooding over my own melancholy reflecti∣ons. I thought I should die—I supposed myself dead—I saw my own funeral—Not a single tear to embalm my memory. A few strag∣gling neighbours attend the scanty procession, conversing on politics, or the current news of the day, as they follow me to the grave. The day after the funeral, some person of the next street asks one of my near neighbours, "Pray,
<PB N="31" REF="024407_0035_0FC70B70C62A79D8"/>
how does the Old Bachelor? I hear he is sick." "He was sick, but he is well enough now—he was buried yesterday."—"Dear me! I never heard of it—and how has the old curmudgeon left his estate?—"To the Pennsylvania Hospital." No more is said about me—they pass on to other chat. After three days, I am no more thought of than if I had never existed, except by the managers of the Pennsylvania Hospital. No widow to be visited and comforted for the loss of me—no chil∣dren to keep my name and memory alive in the world, and to talk of their dear father, some ten or a dozen years after my decease. No elegy in verse or prose to celebrate the virtues I never possessed, or palliate the faults I really had. Not even a para∣graph in the newspaper to announce my departure —Yes—I had some comfort in supposing that my name might creep into the fag-end of your Maga∣zine, under the list of deaths, with a declaration that I had charitably left my estate to the Pennsyl∣vania Hospital.</P>
<P>SUCH was the dismal train of ideas that present∣ed to my imagination. My disorder encreased, my life was despaired of. Some half a dozen second and third cousins came to see me. They disgusted me with their officious and overacted kindnesses. "Why did you not send, my dear cousin, to let
<PB N="32" REF="024407_0036_0FC70B721CFAC320"/>
me know you was sick?" "I never heard a word of it till this morning, and I came the moment I was informed of your danger." Says another,— "Do take this."—" Pray try that."—"There is nothing better for a fever, I have known it to do wonders." Another of my very loving cousins sat down by my bedside, and with a doleful coun∣tenance began a lecture upon the uncertainty of life, and the certainty of death. After a few com∣mon place observations he came to the point he had in view. "I hope, my dear cousin, (said he) that you have settled your worldly affairs; your loving relations expect it of you; I hope you have made your will; these things had better not be delayed; it will be an ease to your mind when that necessary business is over, and you will not die an hour the sooner for having completed it. We all hope you may recover; God grant you may! But, as we are all mortal, and know not how soon we may be called upon, it is prudent to pro∣vide against the worst." I told him that my will was already made, and that I had no inclination to alter it. My cousins continued to tease me with unremitting cruelty; my strength was so exhausted that I could not scold, storm and swear, as I wish∣ed to do. I fretted inwardly; my physician, too, was in league with my cousins; he denied me every thing I desired, and forced upon me every
<PB N="33" REF="024407_0037_0FC70B79B3BBF520"/>
thing I loathed and abhorred; my situation was truly deplorable. I earnestly longed for a draught of cold water; I requested it in terms of the most pathetic solicitation; but to no purpose.—At length I prevailed upon an old negro wench, who is not worth a farthing, and yet the most valuable servant I have got, to bring me, privately, a tan∣kard of water fresh from the pump. I drank it off greedily. It threw me into a profuse sweat and deep sleep—it saved my life—I began to recover. No sooner was I out of danger, but my loving cou∣sins, whom I had not seen for four years before my illness, left me with one consent: and it is more than probable, that they will not visit me again for four years to come—Heaven grant they may not! But I fancy I need be under no apprehensions on that account, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they will discover by this pa∣per that I mean to leave my estate to the Pennsyl∣vania Hospital.</P>
<P>SUCH is the forlorn state of an <HI>Old Bachelor.</HI> Sick or well there is none will do him a service, or even an act of charity, but from interested mo∣tives. I sometimes wish I had married when I was young; but when I look round amongst my ac∣quaintance, and see a tyrannical and extravagant wife, a reprobate spendthrift son, and a daughter, running off with the first vagabond that offers, I
<PB N="34" REF="024407_0038_0FC70B7C801AEAA0"/>
hug myself in my solitary state, and bless my stars that I did not marry when I was young.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, <HI>I find</HI> so many reasons to wish myself a married man; and <HI>see</HI> so many reasons to rejoice that I am not; that my mind is like the pendulum of a clock hanging in suspense, and per∣petually vibrating between two opinions.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING all the fine things that have been said, time out of mind, about the married state, I am persuaded that he who marries must venture boldly. It is not a subject that will bear much reasoning upon. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred it is <HI>passion,</HI> or <HI>interest,</HI> not <HI>reason,</HI> that points to matrimony. Should a man, before he engages, call up to view all the disasters, troubles, and inconveniences, some of which probably may, and others certainly will, occur in the married state, he would never have the courage to engage in it. In my youthful days I fancied myself in love two or three times; I even made some advances to∣wards a courtship: but I <HI>reasoned</HI> too much on the consequences, and therefore I remain, as you see, a <HI>fretful Old Bachelor.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE BACHELOR, N<SUP>o</SUP>. VIII.</HEAD>
<P>—I might have sat in my elbow chair till dooms∣day, and revolved the matter over and over again, till my brain had become as dry as a box of Scotch snuff. I might have wasted the midnight lamp; read all the works of the learned, and of the unlearned, upon the subject; and even out-studied <HI>Duns Scotus,</HI> without being able to determine the point. 'Tis very strange, said I, that any speculation what∣ever, should be supported and contradicted, esta∣blished and confuted by reasons so exactly balancing each other as to leave the judgement hanging in suspence like Mahomet's coffin. The hundred-thousandth part of a grain would set all agoing; and yet I cannot throw that hundred-thousandth part of a grain into one scale, but I find just as much hath dropped into the opposite. In a word, I found it impossible to determine, whether I had better marry or not.</P>
<P>AT last, <HI>an accident</HI>—who would have thought it!—<HI>an accident</HI> settled this important question; broke down the dam which I had been so many years building up, strengthening and repairing, and let out all my objections at once in a torrent. It
<PB N="36" REF="024407_0040_0FC70B8038698F10"/>
would have surprised any body to see how many prudential motives, self-love, avarice, pride, pecu∣liarities of opinion, &amp;c. tumbled out, helter skel∣ter, head-over-heels, in the gushing stream. Here lay <HI>Pride,</HI> bouncing and flouncing indignant through the foaming tide; there lay <HI>Avarice,</HI> wriggling and twisting in mud and slime—On one side, <HI>Self-love,</HI> like a tortoise, collected within its own unsocial shell; on the other, thousands of odd notions and <HI>peculiarities of opinion</HI> crawling about like snails, tad-poles, and unformed vermin.</P>
<P>BUT the accident, which occasioned this ex∣traordinary revolution, is worth relating—</P>
<P>I acquainted you in a former letter, with my ill∣ness and recovery. For the better establishment of my health, exercise and air were much recom∣mended. I made it a practice, therefore, when∣ever the weather was suitable, to walk two or three miles before dinner. One day, as I was taking my usual excursion along the road that leads to the lower ferry on Schulkyl, two women passed me in a chair. The youngest of the two drew the attention of a momentary glance. I thought I saw something in her that made me wish for a longer view. They had not proceeded above an hun∣dred yards when their horse took fright, ran up
<PB N="37" REF="024407_0041_0FC70B8124724E98"/>
against the fence, and overset the chair. I made all possible haste to the assistance of the unfortu∣nate ladies. The elder seemed to have received no great injury; but the young lady, either from the force of the fall, or through fear, had fainted away. I took her in my arms; her head reclined upon my bosom—she was delicate—she was lovely: I felt an anxiety I never felt before. Love, though I knew it not, stole into my heart under the disguise of compassion. I chased her temples, her wrists, and the palms of her hands. The soft touch thrilled through every vein, and awakened unusual sensibilities. She recovered, and, observing her situation, with a gentle effort, disengaged herself from my arms, and thanked me for my care with graceful ease and a lunguishing voice. The el∣der lady, who was her mother, joined in acknow∣ledgements. The horse and broken chair were left at a neighbouring house, and I insisted on conduct∣ing the ladies home.</P>
<P>LITTLE passed during this walk but thankful expressions on the part of the ladies, and polite as∣surances on mine. I did not fail, however, to examine the young lady's person and deportment with great attention, and the more I observed the more I was pleased with her. As they were both much discomposed by the accident, I did not think
<PB N="38" REF="024407_0042_0FC70B858FAF9060"/>
it proper to intrude upon them at that time; but took my leave at the door, with a promise to wait upon them the next day to enquire after their health.</P>
<P>WHEN I returned home, this adventure engross∣ed all my thoughts; I secretly wished myself some twenty years younger, that I might with proprie∣ty make this aimable young woman all my own. What a treasure, said I, must she be to a man of sense and delicacy: How happy should I be at this time if I had, in the earlier part of my life, con∣nected myself with such a sweet companion—but I have missed the golden opportunity, and must e'en fret out the remainder of my days as well as I can.</P>
<P>THE day was long—the night longer. The next morning was chiefly spent in preparations for my afternoon's visit. I was uncommonly particu∣lar about my dress, although I had no deter∣mined object in view. The barber had express orders respecting the dressing of my wig; my best suit of broad-cloth was taken out of the press, and my new beaver neatly and carefully brushed. In short, I was more attentive to my preparations for this visit than I had been for many years. But I
<PB N="39" REF="024407_0043_0FC70B86916E47C0"/>
placed all to the account of politeness and ci∣vility.</P>
<P>WHEN all was ready, I went to the glass to ad∣just my wig. I thought I looked uncommonly well—at least I observed a neatness in my dress and a vivacity in my countenance to which I had long been unaccustomed. Certain reflections arose in my mind which I could not then suppress. And thus I reasoned with myself. Few men carry their age better than I do—this must be owing to the temperance and regularity of my pass'd life. A discreet man of fifty hath the powers of life in greater vigour than a debauchee of twenty-five. Who knows what may happen?—perhaps—Oh! the enchanting idea!—stranger things have come to pass—my fortune is unexceptionable—my per∣son, I think, not disagreeable, and my constitu∣tion rather better since my late illness than be∣fore. At this instant I took up my hat which lay on the table close by an old quarto Family Bible, the corner of my hat, in lifting it, took hold of the upper cover of the Bible and threw it back—when behold! on the first leaf of the aforesaid Bible, these words, in very legible characters, saluted my eye—
<Q>George, the son of Thomas and Alice San∣by, was born in the city of London, on the 10th day of October anno Domini ****</Q>
—I need
<PB N="40" REF="024407_0044_0FC70B895BF17528"/>
not give you the figures—suffice it to say, that this malicious accident had a great effect on my mind. It struck the top-sails of my vanity in a mo∣ment, and dispersed all the gay ideas I had conju∣red up. I left home somewhat disconcerted; and many jarring sensibilities distracted my mind till I got to the house where I was to make my visit.</P>
<P>IT is time to inform you that the mother of this young lady keeps shop in—street: upon the profits of which, and the interest of a thousand pounds left her by her deceased husband, she sup∣ports herself and her only daughter—Her husband had been a merchant of some note; but partly by loses in trade, and chiefly by living too expen∣sively for his income, had it not in his power to leave any thing considerable to his family. This intelligence I artfully obtained from an acquain∣tance in the common way of chat.</P>
<P>I was received by my new friends with great cordiality. The mother was all complaisance and civility, the daughter all sweetness and innocence. Our discourse first turned upon the accident of the preceding day. I was happy in finding it attended with no bad consequences; and happier still (as I took occasion to observe) it had been the means of introducing me to such an agreeable family; declar∣ing
<PB N="41" REF="024407_0045_0FC70B939C372CD0"/>
my intention to take advantage of it by occasi∣nal visits. To this a reply was made quite to my satisfaction. I spent the afternoon and a good part of the evening most agreeably. I returned home in high spirits, and much enamoured with the young lady. I thought no more of the accident of the family Bible, but indulged myself for the re∣mainder of the night in a thousand golden dreams.</P>
<P>NOW, if ever you expect to hear from me a∣gain, I insist that you do not entitle this, or any subsequent letter from me, <HI>The Old Bachelor.</HI> I am not so old perhaps as you may imagine. I dare say <HI>Methuselah</HI> was in leading-strings at my age, or just beginning to cut his teeth. A man so hearty and ruddy as I am, cannot with any propriety be called <HI>Old—Old</HI> philosopher, <HI>Old</HI> hermit, <HI>Old</HI> mar∣ried men, <HI>Old</HI> widower, may be well enough—but <HI>old</HI> should never be applied to a bachelor until he is a great deal older than I am yet—thank God! You may alledge that in some of my letters I have called myself an <HI>Old Bachelor</HI>—but I was not well then, and somewhat low spirited—I did myself great injustice, and have a right to recall the ex∣pression—which I now do—Indulge me in this par∣ticular, and perhaps you may hear from me again.</P>

<P>I WAS much entertained by your friend's expla∣nation of the devices and mottos which distinguish our continental bills of credit. When a motto ac∣companies a device, there should be such a connec∣tion between them that the one should be explana∣tory of the other, so that a little knowledge of the language from which the motto is selected, should be sufficient for a discovery of the author's sen∣timent. But I have often puzzled my brains to no purpose to translate some of the mottos in he∣raldry; there being seldom any connection between the device and the inscription. And as the gram∣mar of the motto is almost always incomplete, I have been inclined to think that the words were only intended as ornamental, in filling up the va∣cant space of a handsome scroll.</P>
<P>YOUR writers of essays and pamphlets are gene∣rally very fond of mottos—as well no title-page as no motto. The person amongst the Indians who acts in the capacity of physician and magician (for they always unite these characters) wears a leaf of some plant on his forehead or breast, to indicate
<PB N="43" REF="024407_0047_0FC70B9A0FBD82B0"/>
his knowledge in the medicinal qualities of herbs; just so a fragment from Virgil or Horace is fre∣quently stuck in the title-page of a pamphlet, mere∣ly to shew that the author understands Latin.</P>
<P>IT is curious to observe how the works of the ancients have been frittered into scraps for this use, and how strangely they have been misapplied. Three or four detached words, having the least seeming analogy with the subject in hand, are ea∣gerly seized upon for a motto: whereas, perhaps, upon examining the passage from which these words have been plundered, and observing what precedes and what follows, we may find a senti∣ment very different from that to which the modern author hath applied them, if not directly contrary to it.</P>
<P>BY the same management passages in Holy Writ may be adduced as authorities for every species of immorality and wickedness. For example, if I wanted a motto in favour of

<P>ABSURD as these applications of scripture may appear, I have known learned preachers almost as much out of the way in handling a text. A text is a motto of the first rank, as it is, or ought to be, the sole business of the subsequent discourse to ex∣plain
<PB N="46" REF="024407_0050_0FC70BA9A320B0E8"/>
and enforce it to the improvement of the hear∣ers. How many sermons fall short of this end? How frequently is a text to a sermon, what a motto is to a coat of arms—mere matter of decoration? Or, which is much worse, how often do preachers distort and misapply texts of scripture to favour some new doctrine or erroneous dogma?</P>
<P>THERE is no doubt but that mottos may be used to advantage, when they are selected with judg∣ment, and applied as an authority or elucidation of the subject in hand. They are with more propriety prefixed to short essays than to prolix and elaborate works; because the general sense of a concise per∣formance may be condensed into a few words more easily than can be expected of a diffuse and volu∣minous work.</P>

<HEAD>THE AMBIGUITY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.</HEAD>
<P>I AM by birth a foreigner, have been some years in the mercantile way, and by a successful attention to business have acquired a handsome fortune for a single man. Content with my acquisitions I closed all accounts, and resolved to travel, and set∣tle wherever my inclination should determine. This city, for many reasons, became the place of my choice. I found it absolutely necessary to devote some time to the study of the English language; and for this purpose I purchased grammars, dictio∣naries, and some of the most approved authors in prose and verse; all which I studied with no small assiduity. I thought, at length, that I had made a considerable proficiency; but either I was deceiv∣ed, or the language itself must be in the fault.</P>
<P>PRECISION in terms, is certainly an important perfection in any language: but, in this, the En∣glish tongue seems to be very deficient; witness the opportunity it affords to your demi-witlings to quibble and pun upon every occasion; owing, as I apprehend, to the ambiguity of the language: many words having the same pronunciation, but
<PB N="48" REF="024407_0052_0FC70BABE3E3ED60"/>
widely differing in signification; and many of which are both pronounced and spelt precisely alike, are made to answer to very different ideas; hence the noble art of <HI>punning,</HI> to which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e English are more addicted than any other nation.</P>
<P>THIS want of precision in a language may some∣times be productive of real inconveniences and serious mistakes, as I know by woeful experience. I will relate a few of the grievances I have suffered on this account; which may amuse you, but were, at the time they happened, truly vexatious to me.</P>
<P>HAVING a desire that my best room should be genteely furnished, I wrote to my correspondent in London for the purpose; and amongst other arti∣cles, req<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sted him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd me a handsome pair of <HI>dogs,</HI> and half a dozen of the most fashionable <HI>chairs.</HI> He replied, that he had endeavoured to comply with my order. That the dogs he had shipped were of an excellent breed, and were thought to be very great beauties, and that he had sent me as handsome a sedan as could be made; apologizing that the other five could not be got ready in time for that conveyance, but should be forwarded as soon as completed. Judge of my disappointment when a pair of beagles came yelp∣ing up from the ship. Besides the first purchase, I
<PB N="49" REF="024407_0053_0FC70BB3E577A8D8"/>
had two guineas to pay for their passage, when I would not have given five shillings for their whole race. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o add t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my mortification, whilst I was unpackin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my sedan chair, one of my witty neighbours observed, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I was determined to have good <HI>cheer,</HI> let the world go as it would; and then making three loud huzzas, said there were three <HI>cheers</HI> more at my service. I wished the chair at the devil, and cursed the language that was liable to so much ambiguity. I sold this chair for less than it cost me, and had just time to coun∣termand the five others my correspondent was preparing to forward.</P>
<P>HAVING accidentally broke a lady's <HI>fan,</HI> I ordered my servant, the next morning▪ to look for and pur∣chase the best and handsomest <HI>fan</HI> he could get, and carry it to the lady with my compliments. My ser∣vant returned, after an absence of two hours, and told me that the lady refused to receive the <HI>fan</HI>; saying, that he must certainly be mistaken; that it could not be intended for her; and that she had no use for such a thing. I was surprised, and asked my servant what he had done with it.— "Sir, I have brought it home with me."—"Well, and where is it?"—"At the door in a cart."— "In a cart!—A fan in a cart!"—I ran to the win∣dow,
<PB N="50" REF="024407_0054_0FC70BB4ED848EB0"/>
and saw a huge <HI>Dutch fan</HI> for winnowing corn.</P>
<P>AT another time, I wanted to rack off some wine, and sent my blundering servant to buy a <HI>crane</HI> for the purpose. After a long stay, he came back and told me he could not find one in the whole market, but had bought a turkey worth half a dozen <HI>cranes;</HI> very wisely observing, that cranes were but poor eating. In like manner, when I once sent him to buy a <HI>goose,</HI> he brought home a taylor's <HI>iron goose</HI> for my dinner. There is no end to my vexations of this kind. Having an inclination to ride out, I ordered him to saddle and bridle the <HI>horse:</HI> but he came into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, sometime after, with the bridle in his hand, and with an embarrassed countenance declared he did not know how to put it on the horse. I called him a blockhead, and went out to shew him how it should be done; when, behold, he had contrived to fasten my sad∣dle on the <HI>wood-horse,</HI> and had been puzzling him∣self with the bridle, not knowing where to fix it. At last I got myself properly equipt; and intending to visit a friend a few miles out of town, I stopped a man on the road, and asked for directions to my friend's house. He told me that I must go on about a mile farther, and I should see a large house on the left hand, and must go in at a great gate.
<PB N="51" REF="024407_0055_0FC70BB67ACF8AC0"/>
Accordingly, as soon as I came in sight of the house, I put spurs to my horse, and rode full gal∣lop up to the door. The family were all greatly alarmed, as I had like to have ran over one of the children in my way, and they were, moreover, ap∣prehensive of sudden bad news. I told them that I had only observed the directions that had been given me, viz. to go in at <HI>a great gait;</HI> but they informed me, that the <HI>gate</HI> at the end of the lane was meant, and not the <HI>gait</HI> of my horse.</P>
<P>ONE of my friends having bought a fine mare for me, I told my servant to go and fetch the mare. By and by comes the worshipful the <HI>mayor</HI> of the city to know what particular business I had with him. I was confounded with shame, and had a thousand apologies to make.</P>
<P>BUT it would be too tedious to recount all the blunders, mistakes, and crosses that have occurred to me in consequence of the duplicity of the En∣glish tongue.</P>
<P>TO render a language precise and determinate, every thing should have its proper <HI>name;</HI> which should differ from all other names as really as the thing to which it belongs differs from all other
<PB N="52" REF="024407_0056_0FC70BC3AD0091A0"/>
things. By applying the same appellation to differ∣ent subjects, we are under the necessity of adding some explanatory word for the sake of distinction: which is not only a troublesome multiplication of words, but a clog to the language, and greatly diminishes its force and elegance. Thus, we are obliged to say, a <HI>bottle-crane,</HI> a <HI>wood-horse,</HI> a <HI>fire-engine,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. Would it not be much better if each <HI>thing</HI> had a <HI>name</HI> peculiar to itself, by which it might, in one word, be known and dis∣tinguished from all other <HI>things?</HI></P>

<HEAD>ON ADVERSITY.</HEAD>
<P>THE least attention will satisfy the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nquiring mind, that the present state of man is not final, but preparatory to a future existence; the happiness or misery of which will not be determined by the unalterable decree of the omnipotent Crea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or, but will more probably depend on the temper and ca∣pacity of the soul of each individual to become an angel of light, or a fiend of darkness. We cannot reasonably suppose that God will forcibly compel any man to be either happy or miserable. Good and evil are set before us, and our own wills must determine the choice. Such, indeed, are the in∣firmities of our nature, that without divine assist∣ance we are unable to persevere in the paths of righteousness. This assistance, however, is gra∣ciously promised to those who sincerely desire it. To <HI>will,</HI> or <HI>not to will,</HI> to be good and happy is in our own power; but really to be so, is the gift of God. He doth indeed continually incite men to a happy choice by the various dispensations of his Providence: either by an accumulation of benefits, which ought to engage their love and gratitude; or by suffering them to experience
<PB N="54" REF="024407_0058_0FC70BC6F00A9198"/>
the trials of adversity, that they may see the va∣nity of temporal enjoyments, and turn their views to more substantial happiness. Yet so entirely free is man, that he too often suffers neither of these powerful inducements to influence his mind as they ought. The smiles of prosperity frequent∣ly producing arrogance, self-sufficiency, immora∣lity, and excess: and the wholesome chastisements of an affectionate Father frequently creating mur∣murings and discontent.</P>
<P>IN the early periods of life, our senses alone are the touch-stones of good and evil. Whatever is grateful and pleasant to them we denominate <HI>good;</HI> whatever is painful and uneasy, we denominate <HI>evil.</HI> This simple distinction is sufficient for the state of infancy, when the nurture and security of the body is the chief concern: but when the mind comes to be enlightened by reason and religion, it will easily perceive, that an undue attention to present enjoyments, or a misapplication of them, may be productive of much future misery; and that temporal crosses and afflictions fit the soul for eternal happiness and glory.</P>
<P>HUMAN nature hath a strong abhorrence of pain, grief, and care. Were it otherwise they
<PB N="55" REF="024407_0059_0FC70BCF8B9633A8"/>
would be of no use in weaning the affections from the vanities of the world. Most medicines are nauseous to the palate and severe in their operation. In this their virtue consists. Affliction is the me∣dicine of the soul. It softens the obdurate heart, and renders it susceptible of good impressions. When we are in pain and sorrow, we learn to feel for the distress of others, and are prompted to acts of charity. When we find that the pleasures of the world cannot give solid, permanent satisfaction— cannot gratify <HI>all</HI> our desires, we are induced to turn to that only Being who is the source of true felicity, and in whom alone there is fulness of joy. In the time of distress <HI>we feel</HI> and <HI>know</HI> what we only had, perhaps, a transient idea of before, that the Christian graces and virtues are the only true sources of happiness; and will be our comfort in the last inevitable hour: when all the palliating vanities of the world, and the anodynes of plea∣sure, must entirely lose their effect. The sensibi∣lities attendant on affliction and distress, are too strong to be continued through the common course of life. The wounds of the mind will heal as well as those of the body. But if afflictions produce their proper effect, the mind, ever remembering that those things may be, will acquire a calm and steady adherence to the dictates of conscience and the practice of virtue: not as a task imposed by
<PB N="56" REF="024407_0060_0FC70BD0F5AB78B0"/>
a superior power whose wrath he would deprecate; but as the highest gratification to himself. He will become habituated to do good; and what is <HI>duty</HI> in others will be <HI>nature</HI> in him.</P>
<P>THUS it is that the calamities of life may become real blessings, if a right use be made of them. If the smiles of prosperity do not fill the soul with gra∣titude, love, and religious joy; they will produce arrogance, self-sufficiency and pride: If pain, dis∣tress, and disappointment, the loss of those we love, and injuries from those who love not us, do not wean the heart from too strong an attachment to the transitory pleasures of life, and direct our views to better hopes; they will either plunge us in the gid∣dy eddies of vicious enjoyments, to drown every painful sensibility, or will throw the mind into a wicked despondency, and occasion profane mur∣murings against the Author of our existence, or fix us in a gross and sinful infidelity.</P>
<P>I may, perhaps, in some parts of this paper, have left open a door for controversy. But I shall not enter the lists with any one. I would rather spend my time in the most unmeaning amusements, than corrupt my heart with the pride and obstinacy of what is called <HI>religious</HI> disputation.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="024407_0061_0FC70BDD45E36E58"/>PLACED, as we are, in a transitory scene of proba∣tion; drawing nigher still and nigher, day by day, to that interesting crisis which must introduce us into a new system of things; ought it not to be our principal concern to use every means that may have a tendency to fit us for that heaven we hope to enjoy? This cannot be done by speculative opi∣nions or ingenious theories; but by habituating the heart to devout sensibilities, and making <HI>that,</HI> rather than the <HI>head,</HI> the seat of virtue.</P>
<P>DRY and unfruitful reasonings, on the one hand, and the enthusiastic rambles of unbridled imagina∣tions on the other, have been the sources of much error to mankind in religious matters. We are not <HI>all</HI> capable of understanding the casuistical re∣finements of the book-learned, neither can we all follow the extravagant sallies of over-heated brains; but we <HI>all</HI> know, or may know, the unquestion∣able path of virtue. Let us pursue that path with unremitting diligence: performing the du∣ties of our respective stations in life with a cheerful activity; enjoying the world without being wedded to its follies, and prepared to leave it when the awful summons shall arrive.</P>

<HEAD>A REVERY.</HEAD>
<P>I ACCIDENTALLY opened the 35th No. of <HI>the Guardian,</HI> wherein a correspondent informs the Author, that some learned men having determined the <HI>pineal gland</HI> to be chief seat of the soul's resi∣dence, he had procured from a great philosopher a box of snuff, which had this remarkable pro∣perty, that a pinch of it, duly administered, would so affect his pineal gland as to enable his soul to leave her residence for a while, and enter that of any other person; where she, in a moment, be∣come acquainted with all the stranger's ideas, knowledge, and pursuits, by mere intuition.</P>
<P>AFTER reading the paper, I closed the book, and reflecting on the singularity of the thought, I fell into one of those deep reveries in which the mind is entirely absorbed, and rendered for a while to∣tally inattentive to the objects of the senses; form∣ing a kind of waking dream.</P>
<P>I fancied myself possessed of some of this ex∣traordinary snuff, and enabled thereby to examine a variety of characters, divested of all dissimula∣tion.
<PB N="59" REF="024407_0063_0FC70BDEE8A3BB78"/>
My heated imagination led me a long chace through the intricate windings of the human heart. The rapidity of my progress made it impossible to delineate my observations on paper: for it takes a great deal more time <HI>to write</HI> than to <HI>think.</HI> But I will try to recollect two or three of my ex∣cursions for your amusement.</P>
<P>AFTER taking a view of many capricious cha∣racters, I entered the pineal gland of <HI>a miser,</HI> I found his soul seated on her throne, with a large family of domestics around her: some waiting the orders of her <HI>will,</HI> and others executing her purposes with the utmost attention and assiduity.</P>
<P><Q>You see, (said she) with what industry I am labouring to fulfil the designs of our great Cre∣ator. You know that he has assigned us our re∣spective little dominions here, that by a proper direction of the <HI>will,</HI> left free for that purpose, we may attain <HI>happiness.</HI> I cannot indeed say that I have as yet quite answered this benevolent end; but I am striving for it with all possible as∣siduity. I have, by unremitting care and atten∣tion, acquired a large portion of wealth, which would, I believe, make me very happy, were it not for two terrible apprehensions. One is, lest, by some unforeseen accident, I should be de∣prived
<PB N="60" REF="024407_0064_0FC70BE06393FC88"/>
of the fruit of my long labour; and the other is, lest an awful summons should remove me from this government, and compel me to leave all my hard earned acquisitions behind. I en∣deavour to guard against the first of these evils by continually making such additions to my stock as to render it improbable that any one casualty should deprive me of the whole: and as the other is without remedy, I endeavour to think of it as little as possible.</Q></P>
<P>I now took a view of her family, which I found in a deplorable condition indeed—and no wonder— since <HI>Avarice</HI> was prime minister, and had gain∣ed an entire ascendency over the soul. I saw <HI>Ho∣nesty</HI> languishing under an incurable hectic: <HI>Con∣science</HI> dying of her wounds: and <HI>Honour</HI> lay gas∣ping for breath, and as cold as a stone; all the noble passions were benummed and <HI>frost-bitten</HI>; and as for <HI>Religion,</HI> she was close confined under a suspicion of disaffection to the present government, and of having formed a traitorous design to obstruct the soul in her pursuit of happiness. I enquired for <HI>Charity;</HI> but was told that she died an em∣bryo: her body, however, had been preserved in spirit, and was shown to me as a great curiosity— Natural affection, sympathy, compassion, and all the social feelings were crawling about naked and almost starved to death. In the midst, sat the soul herself,
<PB N="61" REF="024407_0065_0FC70BE26C048E00"/>
sullen, fearful, and deeply anxious. She was nei∣ther clothed with the robes of knowledge, nor de∣corated with the jewels of fancy. In vain did <HI>Me∣mory</HI> strive to sooth her melancholy, by recounting the transactions of former times; and <HI>Hope,</HI> who should have sung of joys to come, had got so bad a cold that she could not sing at all. Her palace was in no better condition than her family. The necessary repairs were refused or neglected—deco∣rations it had none. Within and without it exhi∣bited the appearances of extreme poverty. Num∣berless fine aqueducts were entirely dried up and in a ruinous condition: others were choaked up with undigested crudities, and the animal spirits were in∣spissated by long inactivity, and lazily crept through their rusty channels—Even the throne itself, the pi∣neal gland, had shrunk into less than ordinary size; from whence it had been concluded, that <HI>the man</HI> had a <HI>little soul</HI>—but erroneously, for, in fact, souls are of no size at all.</P>
<P>FROM this odious habitation I flew on the wings of thought to a character the very reverse. I en∣tered the pineal gland of a Libertine. Here all was uproar and confusion: the soul seemed to have lost her command. Her unruly passions had wrested the government from her hand, and tyrannised over her domestics with unlimited sway;
<PB N="62" REF="024407_0066_0FC70BE84CCA71D0"/>
whilst the soul sat upon her throne in stupid a∣mazement. <HI>Religion</HI> lay in a deep trance; <HI>Conscience</HI> was dosing under repeated anodynes; and the the voice of <HI>Charity</HI> could not be heard in the tu∣mult. <HI>Hope</HI> was wasting in a deep consumption; and <HI>Fear</HI> lay, with her throat cut, a ghastly sight, but as the wound was not mortal, she made fre∣quent and dreadful struggles for life. <HI>Ambition</HI> was in a state of insanity, and played off a thousand ridiculous gambols; <HI>Love</HI> lay groveling in the mire, with his wings clipt, and all his fine feathers sullied with mud and filth; and <HI>Honour</HI> had be∣come so whimsical and captious, that she was per∣petually embroiled in quarrels and disputes. As to the palace itself, it was so filled with combusti∣bles that I expected every minute it would take fire and be entirely consumed. I left it therefore as speedily as possible, and by an easy transition, found myself in the pineal gland of <HI>a sot.</HI></P>
<P>HERE I found the soul sitting solitary on her throne, abridged of almost all her domestics, and divested of almost all her powers. She was af∣flicted with a deep and incurable lethargy, near∣ly approaching to absolute annihilation. She might have found some degree of satisfaction even in her insensibility, but that <HI>Truth,</HI> whose voice she could not silence, frequently reminded her, that
<PB N="63" REF="024407_0067_0FC70BEC9E648C50"/>
the dissolution of her dominion was near at hand, when the domestics she had now dismissed would return, and become her perpetual tormentors. I observed, with great surprise, that she had lost much of the spirituality of her nature, and seemed to be condensed into an almost palpable and visible mass of matter. I scarcely knew her to be one of us—her habitation, for it could not be called a pa∣lace, was in a most alarming condition. An inun∣dation, highly corrosive, had insinuated itself into every department, defiled the very seat of majesty, and undermined the foundation of the building, so that it tottered on its base, and seemed just ready to fall in ruins.</P>
<P>HAVING gone thus far, I had an inclination to visit a body after the soul had left it. By an effort of imagination, I pierced the grave, and entered the pineal gland of a corpse newly i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er∣red. But description would here be highly dis∣gusting. Every thing I saw inspired aversion and horror. The hissings of putrid fermentation— the cracking of the cordage, and the bursting of cataracts, sounded through the hollow fabric, and filled me with inconceivable terror and dismay. But what alarmed me most, I perceived a gentle oscillation beginning in the heart, and felt myself constrained by a potent influence, like a person op∣prest

<HEAD>A PRETTY STORY: Written in the year 1774.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>ONCE upon a time, a great while ago, there lived a certain nobleman, who had long possessed a very valuable farm, and had a great number of children and grand-children.</P>
<P>BESIDES the annual profits of his farm, which were very considerable, he kept a large shop of goods; and being very successful in trade, he be∣came in process of time exceeding rich and power∣ful, insomuch that all his neighbours feared and respected him.</P>
<P>HE had examined all the known systems of oeconomy, and selected from them, for the govern∣ment of his own family, all such parts as appeared to be equitable and beneficial, and omitted those which experience had shown to be inconvenient or prejudicial: or rather, by blending their several constitutions together, he had so ingeniously coun∣ter-balanced
<PB N="66" REF="024407_0070_0FC70BF66E2E0580"/>
the evils of one by the benefits of another, that the advantages were fully enjoyed, and the inconveniences scarcely felt.</P>
<P>HE never exercised any undue authority over his children or servants; neither indeed could he greatly oppress them, if he was ever so disposed; for it was particularly covenanted in his marriage arti∣cles, that he should never impose any task or hard∣ships upon his children without the consent of his wife.</P>
<P>Now the custom in his family was this:—that at the end of every seven years his marriage be∣came null and void, at which time his children and grand-children met together and chose another wife for him, whom the old gentleman was oblig∣ed to marry under the same articles and restrictions as before. By this means the children had always a great interest in their mother-in-law, and through her a reasonable check upon their father's temper. For, besides that he could do nothing material re∣specting them without her approbation, she was sole mistress of the purse-strings, and gave him from time to time such sums as <HI>she</HI> thought necessary for the expences of his family.</P>
<P>BEING one day in a very extraordinary good
<PB N="67" REF="024407_0071_0FC70BF7A6C4D5D0"/>
humour, he gave his children a writing under hand and seal, by which he released them from many badges of dependence, and confirmed to them several very important privileges. The chief of these were, that none of his children should be punished for any offence, or supposed offence, until twelve of his brethren had examined the facts, and declared him subject to such punish∣ment; and, secondly, he renewed his assurances that no tasks or hardships should be imposed upon them without the consent of their mother-in-law.</P>
<P>THIS writing, on account of its singular impor∣tance, was called THE GREAT PAPER. After it was executed with the utmost solemnity, he caused his chaplain to publish a dire anathema against all who should attempt to violate the articles of the <HI>Great Paper,</HI> in the words following:</P>
<P>"In the name of the <HI>Father, Son,</HI> and <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> Amen! Whereas our Lord and Master, to the honour of God, and for the common profit of this farm, hath granted for him and his heirs for ever, these articles above-written; I his chaplain and spiritual pastor of all this farm, do admonish the people of this farm, <HI>once, twice,</HI> and <HI>thrice.</HI>— Because that shortness will not suffer so much delay as to give knowledge to the people of these pre∣sents
<PB N="68" REF="024407_0072_0FC70BF9201E2718"/>
in writing: I therefore enjoin all persons, of what estate soever they be, that they, and every of them, as much as in them is, shall uphold and maintain these articles, granted by our Lord and Master, in all points. And all those that in any point do resist, or break, or in any manner, hereafter procure, counsel, or any ways assent to, resist, or break these ordinances, or go about it by word or deed, openly or privately, by any manner of pretence or colour; I, the aforesaid chaplain, by my authority, do <HI>excommunicate</HI> and <HI>accurse;</HI> and from the body of our Lord Jesus Christ, and from all the company of heaven, and from all the sacraments of holy church, do <HI>sequester</HI> and <HI>ex∣clude.</HI>"</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>NOW it came to pass, that this nobleman had, by some means or other, acquired a right to an immense tract: of wild, uncultivated country, at a vast distance from his mansion-house. But he set little store by this estate, as it yielded him no pro∣fit, nor was it likely so to do; being not only dif∣ficult of access on account of the distance, but was inhabited by numerous wild beasts, very fierce and savage, so as to render it very dangerous to at∣tempt taking possession of it.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="024407_0073_0FC70C0006694028"/>IN process of time, however, some of his chil∣dren, more stout and enterprising than the rest, requested leave of their father to go and settle in this distant country. Leave was readily obtained: but before they set out, certain articles were stipu∣lated between them. The old gentleman engaged on his part to protect the adventurers in their new settlement; to assist them in chasing away the wild beasts; and to extend to them all the essential pri∣vileges and benefits of the government under which they were born: assuring them, that although they would be removed so far from his presence, they should always be considered as the children of his family. At the same time he gave each of them a bond<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charters.</NOTE> for the faithful performance of these promises: in which it was moreover covenanted, that they should have the privilege of making such rules and regulations for the good government of their respective families as they should find most convenient: provided only, that these rules and regulations should not be contradictory to, or in∣consistent with, the general established orders of his houshold.</P>
<P>IN return, he insisted that they, on their parts, should at all times acknowledge him to be their
<PB N="70" REF="024407_0074_0FC70C0280D4EFB8"/>
father; that they should not deal with others with∣out his leave, but send to his shop for what they might want, and not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell the produce of their lands to any but those he should point out.</P>
<P>THESE preliminaries being duly adjusted, our adventurers bid adieu to the comforts and conve∣niences of their father's house. Many and great were the difficulties and dangers they encounter∣red on the way; but many more, and much grea∣ter, on their arrival in the new country. There they found mountains covered with impervious forests, and plains steeped in stagnated waters—no friend∣ly roof to shelter them from the roaring tem∣pest—no fortress to protect them from surroun∣ding dangers—many sunk under sickness and dis∣ease, and others fell a prey to the barbarous na∣tives of the country.</P>
<P>THEY began, however, under all disadvantages to clear the land. The woods resound with the strokes of the ax—they drain the waters from the sedged morass, and pour the sun beams on the reek∣ing soil. They are compelled to exert all the powers of industry and oeconomy for bare subsi∣stence; and, like their first parents, when driven from paradise, to earn their bread with the sweat
<PB N="71" REF="024407_0075_0FC70C03E8891340"/>
of their brows. In this work they were frequently interrupted by the incursions of the savages, a∣gainst whom they defended themselves with great magnanimity.</P>
<P>AFTER some time, however, by their indefati∣gable perseverance they found themselves comfor∣tably settled, and had the delightful prospect of fields waving with luxuriant harvests, and orchards, glowing with the fruits of their labour.</P>
<P>IN the mean while they kept up a constant cor∣respondence with their father's family; and provid∣ed, at a great expence, the means of procuring from his shop such goods and merchandizes as they wanted, for which they duly paid out of the produce of their lands, and the fruits of their industry.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P>NOW the new settlers had adopted a mode of government in their several families similar to that to which they had been acustomed in their father's house: particularly in taking a new wife at the end of certain periods of time, without whose consent they could do nothing material in the conduct of their affairs. Under these circumstances, they
<PB N="72" REF="024407_0076_0FC70C08A8E661F8"/>
thrived exceedingly, and became very numerous, living in great harmony with each other, and in constitutional obedience to their father's wife.</P>
<P>TO protect them against the incursions of the bar∣barous natives, and the attacks of some of their neighbours, the old nobleman sent a number of his servants, but then he required that they should reimburse him for the trouble and expence he was at in furnishing this assistance; and this they cheer∣fully did, by applying from time to time to their respective wives for the necessary cash.</P>
<P>THUS did matters go on for a considerable time, to the mutual benefit of the old and new farms. But at last the nobleman's wife began to look with an avaricious eye towards the new settlers; saying to herself, if by the natural consequence of their friendly intercourse with us, and constitutional de∣pendence on me our wealth and power are so much encreased, how much more would they accumu∣late, if I can persuade them, that all they possess belonged originally to me, and that I may, in right of my prerogative, demand of them such por∣tions of their earnings as I please. At the same time, being well aware of the promises and agree∣ments her husband had made, and of the tenor and force of the <HI>Great Paper,</HI> she thought it best to pro∣ceed
<PB N="73" REF="024407_0077_0FC70C0FE7AEAD18"/>
with great caution, and determined to gain her point, if possible, by subtile and impercep∣tible steps.</P>
<P>FOR this purpose, she first issued an edict, set∣ting forth—That whereas the taylors of her fami∣ly were greatly injured by the people of the new farm, inasmuch as they undertook to make up their own clothes, whereby the said taylors were depri∣ved of the benefits that should arise from their trade: it was ordained, that for the future, the new settlers should not be permitted to have any <HI>shears</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prohibition of splitting-mills.</NOTE> or scis∣sars in their families, under severe penalties. In con∣sequence of this, our adventurers were obliged to have their clothes made up by the taylors of the old farm, although they were well able to make them up themselves. Nevertheless, out of respect to the old gentleman, they patiently submitted to this im∣position.</P>
<P>OBSERVING also, that the new settlers were ve∣ry fond of a kind of cyder, which they purchased of a person in friendship with their father (the fruit proper for making this cyder not growing on their own grounds), she issued another edict<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Duty on wines.</NOTE>, obliging them to pay her a certain stipend on every barrel
<PB N="74" REF="024407_0078_0FC70C11265BF240"/>
of this cyder used in their families—To this they likewise submitted; not yet seeing the scope of her designs against them.</P>
<P>THUS she gradually proceeded in her plan, im∣posing internal taxes on the new settlers, under various pretences, and receiving the fruits of their toil with both hands: moreover she persuaded her husband to send amongst them, from time to time, a number of the most lazy and worthless of his servants, under the specious pretext of defending them in their settlements; but, in fact, to rid his house of their company, not having employment for them at home: and more especially to be a watch and a check upon the people of the new farm. He had also ordered that these <HI>protec∣tors,</HI> as they were called, should be supplied by the new settlers with bread and butter, cut in a parti∣cular form. But the head of one of the families, refused to comply with this whimsical order. He engaged to give the guests, thus forced upon him, bread and butter sufficient, but insisted that his wife should cut it in what shape she pleased. This put the old nobleman in a violent passion, inso∣much that he had his son's wife put into jail <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Suspension of the legislature of New York, for supplying the army with pepper and vinegar, by act of assembly.</NOTE>, for
<PB N="75" REF="024407_0079_0FC70C129D94A5A8"/>
presuming to cut her own loaf according to her own mind.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>AS the old nobleman advanced in years, he ne∣glected the affairs of his family; leaving them chiefly to the management of his steward. Now the steward had actually debauched his wife, and gained an entire ascendency over her. She no longer deliberated upon measures that might best promote the prosperity of the old farm or the new; but said and did whatever the steward put into her head. Nay, so entirely was she under his influence, that she could not utter even <HI>aye</HI> or <HI>no</HI> but as he directed her. For he had cunningly persuaded her, that it was very fashionable for wo∣men of quality to wear padlocks on their lips; and he accordingly fastened a small padlock to each cor∣ner of her mouth: when the one was open she could only cry <HI>aye;</HI> and when the other was un∣locked she could only say <HI>no.</HI> And he took care to keep the keys of these padlocks in his own pocket; so that her words were the expressions of his will rather than of her own.</P>
<P>NOW the old lady and the steward had set themselves strenuously against the people of the
<PB N="76" REF="024407_0080_0FC70C142636F580"/>
new farm; and began to devise ways and means for their total and unconditional subjection. And to this end they prevailed on the nobleman to sign an edict against the new settlers; in which it was declared, that, as children, it was their duty to contribute towards supplying their father's table with provisions, and towards the support of the dignity of his family; for which purposes it was ordained, that all their spoons, knives and forks, plates and porringers, should be marked <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Stamp act.</NOTE> with a certain mark by officers he should appoint for the purpose; for which marking they should pay certain fees into his strong box: and it was or∣dained, that they should not, under severe penal∣ties, presume to use any spoon, knife, fork, plate or porringer before it had been so marked by the officer, and the fees paid.</P>
<P>THE inhabitants of the new farm began now to see that their father's affections were alienated from them; and that their mother was but a base mother-in-law, governed by their enemy the stew∣ard. They were thrown into great confusion and distress by this discovery. They wrote the most supplicating letters to their father; in which they acknowledged their dependence upon him in terms
<PB N="77" REF="024407_0081_0FC70C1A3907C6F8"/>
of the most sincere affection and respect. They reminded him of the difficulties and hardships they had suffered in settling this new farm; and point∣ed out the great addition of wealth and power his family had acquired by their improvement of an unprofitable wilderness; and showed him that all the fruits of their labour must, by a natural cir∣culation, finally enrich his money-box. They mentioned, in terms of humility, his promises and engagements to them when they left home, and the bonds <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charters.</NOTE> he had given them; and held up in a strong point of view, the solemnity and impor∣tance of the <HI>Great Paper.</HI> They acknowledged that he ought to be re-imbursed the expences he had incurred upon their account; and that it was their duty to assist in supporting the dignity of the family. All this they declared they were willing and ready to do; but requested that they might do it in the manner pointed out by the <HI>Great Paper;</HI> by applying to their respective wives for the keys of their money-boxes, and furnishing him from thence: but earnestly prayed that they might not be subjected to the caprice and tyranny of an avaricious mother-in-law, whom they had never chosen, and of a steward, who was their declared enemy.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="024407_0082_0FC70C1D1DD6C370"/>SOME of these letters were intercepted by the steward; others indeed were delivered to the no∣bleman: but he was persuaded not only to treat them with contempt, but to insist the more stre∣nuously on the right his wife claimed to mark the knives and forks, plates and porringers, of the new settlers.</P>
<P>WHEN the people of the new farm heard of the ill success of their letters, and understood how matters were conducted in their father's fa∣mily, they were exceedingly alarmed and distressed. They consulted together on the situation of affairs, and determined that they would no longer submit to the arbitrary impositions of their mother-in-law, and of their enemy the steward; that they consi∣dered the new decree as a direct violation of the <HI>Great Paper;</HI> and would not pay obedience to it, but would sup their broth and eat their pudding as usual, without having their spoons, knives and forks, plates or porringers, marked by the new officers.</P>
<P>THE old nobleman and his wife, finding that the new decree could not be established without actual force, and fearing the consequences of an open contest, thought fit to annul the offensive
<PB N="79" REF="024407_0083_0FC70C1EAC2BE838"/>
edict, under the pretence of <HI>mere expediency;</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Declaratory Act.</NOTE> de∣claring and protesting, at the same time, that he and his wife had an undoubted right to mark all the furniture of the new settlers, if they pleased, from the silver tankard in the closet to the cham∣ber-pot under the bed: that, with respect to them, he was not bound by the shackles of the <HI>Great Pa∣per;</HI> and in a word, that he and wife had, and ought to have, an uncontroled power over them, their lives, liberties, and property.</P>
<P>THE people, however, took little notice of these pompous declarations. They were glad that the marking decree was annulled; and were in hopes that by degrees things would settle in their former course, and mutual affection be again restored.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<P>IN the mean time the new settlers encreased ex∣ceedingly, their dealings at their father's shop be∣came proportionably enlarged, and their partia∣lity for their brethren of the old farm was sincere and manifest. They suffered, indeed, some in conveniences from the <HI>protectors</HI> which had been stationed amongst them, who became very trou∣blesome
<PB N="80" REF="024407_0084_0FC70C210721DDE0"/>
in their houses. They introduced riot and intemperance into their families, debauched their daughters, and derided the orders they had made for their own good government. Moreover, the old nobleman had, at different times, sent over to them a great number of thieves, murderers, and robbers, who did much mischief by practising those crimes for which they had been banished from the old farm. But they bore those evils with as much patience as could be expected; not chusing to trouble their old father with complaints, unless in cases of important necessity.</P>
<P>NOW the steward began to hate the new settlers with exceeding great hatred, and determined to renew his attack upon their peace and happiness. He artfully insinuated to the nobleman and his foolish wife, that it was very mean, and unbecom∣ing their greatness, to receive the contributions of the people of the new farm through the consent of their respective wives: that upon this footing they might some time or other refuse to comply with his requisitions, if they should take into their heads to think them oppressive and unreasonable; and that it was high time they should be compelled to acknowledge his unlimited power and his wife's <HI>omnipotence,</HI> which, if not enforced now, they would soon be able to resist, as they were daily encreasing in numbers and strength.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="024407_0085_0FC70C2A528DBD98"/>ANOTHER decree was, therefore, prepared and published, directing that the people of the new farm should pay a certain stipend upon particular goods,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Painter's colours, glass▪ &amp;c.</NOTE> which they were not allowed to purchase any where but at their father's shop; specifying that this imposition should not be laid as an ad∣vance upon the original price of these goods, but should be paid as a tax on their arrival in the new farm; for the express purpose of supporting the dignity of the nobleman's family, and for re-im∣bursing the expences he pretended to have been at on their account.</P>
<P>THIS new decree occasioned great uneasiness. The people saw plainly that the steward and their mother-in-law were determined to enslave and ruin them. They again consulted together, and wrote, as before, the most dutiful and persuasive letters to their father—but to no purpose—a deaf ear was turned against all their remonstrances, and their humble requests rejected with contempt.</P>
<P>FINDING that this moderate and decent conduct brought them no relief, they had recourse to ano∣ther expedient: they bound themselves to each other in a solemn engagement,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Non-importation agreement.</NOTE> not to deal any
<PB N="82" REF="024407_0086_0FC70C2B6E2CA208"/>
more at their father's shop, until this unconstitu∣tional decree should be repealed, which they one and all declared to be a direct violation of the <HI>Great Paper.</HI></P>
<P>THIS agreement was so strictly observed, that in a few months the clerks and apprentices in the old gentleman's shop began to raise a terrible outcry. They declared, that their master's trade was de∣clining exceedingly, and that his wife and steward would by their mischievous machinations ruin the whole farm. They sharpened their pens, and at∣tacked the steward, and even the old lady herself, with great severity: insomuch, that it was thought proper to withdraw this attempt also, upon the rights and liberties of the new settlers. One part only of the decree was left still in force, viz. the tax upon <HI>water-gruel.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tea.</NOTE></P>
<P>NOW there were certain men <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The India company.</NOTE> in the old farm, who had obtained an exclusive right of selling <HI>wa∣ter-gruel.</HI> Vast quantities of this gruel were vend∣ed amongst the new settlers, as they were extreme∣ly fond of it, and used it universally in their families. They did not, however, trouble themselves much about the tax on <HI>water-gruel;</HI> they were well
<PB N="83" REF="024407_0087_0FC70C2CDDB8E6E8"/>
pleased with the repeal of the other parts of the decree, and fond as they were of this gruel, they considered it as not absolutely necessary to the comfort of life, and determined to give up the use of it in their families, and so avoid the effects of that part of the decree.</P>
<P>THE steward found his designs again frustrated: but was not discouraged by the disappointment. He devised another scheme, so artfully contrived, that he thought himself sure of success. He sent for the persons who had the sole right of vending <HI>water-gruel;</HI> and after reminding them of the o∣bligations they were under to the nobleman and his wife for the exclusive privilege they enjoyed, he requested that they would send sundry waggons la∣den with gruel to the new farm; promising that the accustomed duty which they paid for their exclusive right should be taken off from all the gruel they should so send amongst the new settlers; and that in case their cargoes should come to any damage, the loss should be made good to them out of his master's coffers.</P>
<P>THE gruel-merchants readily consented to this proposal; considering that if their cargoes were sold, their profits would be very great; and if they failed, the steward was to pay the damage.
<PB N="84" REF="024407_0088_0FC70C2E6FCEE058"/>
On the other hand, the steward hoped that the new settlers would not be able to resist a tempta∣tion, thus thrown in their way, of purchasing their favourite gruel, to which they had been so long accustomed; and if they did use it, subject to the tax aforesaid, he would consider this as a vo∣luntary acknowledgement that the nobleman and his wife had a right to lay upon them what imposi∣tions they pleased, and as a resignation of the pri∣vileges of the <HI>Great Paper.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the new settlers were well aware of this decoy. They saw plainly that the gruel was not sent for their accommodation; and that if they su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ered any part of it to be sold amongst them, subject to the tax imposed by the new de∣cree, it would be considered as a willing submis∣sion to the assumed omnipotence of their mother-in-law, and a precedent for future unlimited impo∣sitions. Some, therefore, would not permit the wag∣gons to be unladen at all; but sent them back un∣touched to the gruel-merchants; and others suf∣fered them to unload, but would not touch the dangerous commodity; so that it lay neglected a∣bout the roads and high-ways till it was quite spoiled. But one of the new settlers, whose name was JACK, either from a keener sense of the in∣juries intended, or from the necessity of his situa∣tion,
<PB N="85" REF="024407_0089_0FC70C34AD6BD690"/>
which was such that he could not send back the gruel, because of a number of mercena∣ries <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Board of Commissioners.</NOTE> whom his father had stationed in his house to be a watch over him—he, I say, being almost driven to despair, stove <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Destruction of the tea at Boston.</NOTE> to pieces the casks of gru∣el which had been sent him, and utterly destroyed the whole cargo.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<P>THESE violent proceedings were soon known at the old farm. Great was the uproar there. The old nobleman fell into a furious passion, de∣claring that the new settlers meant to throw off all dependence upon him, and rebel against his authori∣ty. His wife also tore the padlocks from her lips, and raved and stormed like a Billingsgate, and the steward lost all patience and moderation—swearing most profanely, <HI>that he would leave no stone un∣turned, till he had humbled the settlers of the new farm at his feet, and caused their father to tread upon their necks.</HI> Moreover, the gruel-merchants roared and bellowed for the loss of their gruel; and the clerks and apprentices were in the utmost consternation lest the people of the new farm should again agree to have no dealings with their father's shop.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="024407_0090_0FC70C375EEF9DE0"/>VENGEANCE was forthwith prepared, especially against <HI>Jack.</HI> With him they determined to be∣gin; hoping that by making a severe example of him, they should so terrify the other families, that they would all submit to the power of the stew∣ard and acknowledge the omnipotence of the <HI>great Madam.</HI></P>
<P>A very large padlock <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Boston Port-bill.</NOTE> was sent over to be fastened on <HI>Jack's</HI> great gate; the key of which was given to the old nobleman, who was not to suffer it to be opened until <HI>Jack</HI> had paid for the gruel he had spilt, and resigned all claim to the privileges of the <HI>Great Paper</HI>—nor even then, unless he should think fit. Secondly, A decree was made to new model the regulations and oeconomy of <HI>Jack's</HI> family, in such manner that they might in future be more subjected to the will of the steward. And, thirdly, A large gallows was erected before the mansion-house in the old farm, that if any of Jack's children should be suspected of misbehaviour, they should not be convicted or acquitted by the voice of their bre∣thren, according to the purport of the <HI>Great Paper,</HI> but he tied neck and heels, and sent over to be hanged on this gallows.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="024407_0091_0FC70C38DE476760"/>ON hearing of these severities, the people were highly enraged. They were at a loss how to act, or by what means they should avoid the threat∣ened vengeance. But the old lady and the steward persisted. The great padlock was fastened on <HI>Jack's</HI> gate, and the key given to the nobleman as had been determined on; without waiting to know whether <HI>Jack</HI> would pay for the gruel, or allowing him an opportunity to make any apology or defence.</P>
<P>POOR <HI>Jack</HI> was now in a deplorable condition indeed: The great inlet to his farm was entirely shut up; so that he could neither carry out the produce of his land for sale, nor receive from abroad the necessaries for his family.</P>
<P>BUT this was not all—The old nobleman, a∣long with the padlock aforesaid, had sent an over∣seer <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">General Gage, made Governor of the province.</NOTE> to hector and domineer over <HI>Jack</HI> and his family, and to endeavour to break his spirits by every possible severity; for which purpose, this overseer was attended by a great number of mer∣cenaries, and armed with more than common au∣thorities.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="024407_0092_0FC70C42FB09DC70"/>WHEN the overseer first arrived in <HI>Jack's</HI> fa∣mily, he was received with great respect, because he was the delegate of their aged father. For, notwithstanding all that had past, the people of the new farm loved and revered the old nobleman with true filial affection: and attributed his un∣kindness entirely to the intrigues of the steward.</P>
<P>BUT this fair weather did not last long. The new overseer took the first opportunity to show that he had no intention of living in harmony and friendship with the family—Some of <HI>Jack's</HI> do∣mestics had put on their Sunday clothes, and waited on the overseer in the great parlour, to pay him their compliments on his arrival <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Address to General Gage.</NOTE>; and to request his assistance in reconciling their father to them, and restoring peace and cordiality between the old and new farms. But he, in a most abrupt and rude manner, stopped them short in the midst of their address; called them a parcel of disobedient scoun∣drels; bid them go about their business; and tur∣ning round on his heel, left the room with an air of contempt and disdain.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<P>THE people of the new farm seeing the im∣portance of their situation, had appointed a grand committee, consisting of some of the most respect∣able characters from each family, to manage their affairs in this difficult crisis. <HI>Jack,</HI> thus oppressed and insulted, requested the advice <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Boston consults the congress of the states.</NOTE> of the grand committee as to his conduct. This committee in their answer, sympathized cordially with him in his afflictions—they exhorted him to bear his suffering with fortitude for a time; assuring him, that they looked upon the insults and punishments inflicted on him with the same indignation as if they had been inflicted on themselves; and promised to stand by and support him to the last—They recommended it to him to be firm and steady in the cause of liberty and their just rights, and never to acknow∣ledge the <HI>omnipotence</HI> of their mother-in-law, nor submit to the machinations of their enemy the steward.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, lest <HI>Jack's</HI> family should suffer for want of necessaries, his great gate being fast locked, contributions were raised for his re∣lief

<P>THE new overseer still persisted in his hostile be∣haviour, taking every opportunity to mortify and insult <HI>Jack</HI> and his family—observing that some of the children and domestics held frequent meetings and consultations together, sometimes in the garret, and sometimes in the stable, and understanding that an agreement not to deal with their father's shop, until their grievances should be redressed, was a∣gain talked of, he wrote a thundering prohibition<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Proclamation at Boston forbidding town meetings.</NOTE>, much like a pope's bull, which he caused to be pasted up in every room of the house—In which he declared and protested, that such meetings were treasonable, traitorous, and rebellious, contrary to the dignity of his master, the no∣bleman, and inconsistent with the duty they owed to his <HI>omnipotent</HI> wife: and threatened that if two of the family should be found whispering together, they should be sent over in chains to the old farm, and hanged upon the great gallows be∣fore the mansion-house.</P>

<HEAD>A PROPHECY: Written in 1776.</HEAD>
<P>NOW it shall come to pass in the latter days, that a new people shall rise up in a far country, and they shall increase exceedingly, and many shall flock unto them; and they shall build cities in the wilderness, and cultivate their lands with the hand of industry, and the fame of them shall spread far and near.</P>
<P>AND it shall be that the king of islands shall send over and plant in the midst of them a certain tree. Its blossoms shall be delightful to the eye; its fruit pleasant to the taste, and its leaves shall heal them of all manner of diseases. And the people shall cultivate this tree with all possible care, and they shall live under the shadow of its bran∣ches, and shall worship it as a God.</P>
<P>BUT in process of time, there shall arise a <HI>North</HI> wind, and shall blast the tree, so that it shall no longer yield its fruit, or afford shelter to the
<PB N="93" REF="024407_0097_0FC70C4F5D1A7080"/>
people, but it shall become rotten at the heart; and the <HI>North</HI> wind will break the branches thereof, and they shall fall upon the heads of the people, and wound many.</P>
<P>THEN a prophet <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. F—n.</NOTE> shall arise from amongst this people, and he shall exhort them, and instruct them in all manner of wisdom, and many shall be∣lieve in him; and he shall wear spectacles upon his nose; and reverence and esteem shall rest upon his brow. And he will cry aloud, and say—Seeing that this tree hath no strength in it, and that it can no longer shelter us from the winds of the <HI>North,</HI> but is become rotten in the heart; behold now, let us cut it down and remove it from us: And in its place we will plant another tree, young and vigorous; and we will water it, and it shall grow, and spread its branches abroad. And moreover, we will build an high wall to defend it from the winds of the <HI>North</HI>: that it may be well with us, and our children, and our children's children.</P>
<P>AND the people shall hearken to the voice of their prophet, for his sayings shall be good in their eyes. And they shall take up every man his spade and his ax, and shall prepare to dig up and cut
<PB N="94" REF="024407_0098_0FC70881F8FD6E88"/>
away the shattered remains of the blasted and rot∣ten tree, according to the words of their prophet.</P>
<P>THEN a certain wise man shall arise, and shall himself CATO<NOTE PLACE="foot">Dr. S—h.</NOTE>; and he shall strive to persuade the people to put their trust in the rotten tree, and not to dig it up, or remove it from its place. And he shall harangue with great vehemence, and shall tell them that a rotten tree is better than a sound one; and that it is for the benefit of the people that the <HI>North</HI> wind should blow upon it, and that the bran∣ches thereof should be broken and fall upon and crush them.</P>
<P>AND he shall receive from the king of the is∣lands, fetters of gold and chains of silver; and he shall have hopes of great reward if he will fasten them on the necks of the people, and chain them to the trunk of the rotten tree. And this he shall strive to do by every insinuating art in his power. And shall tell the people, that they are not fetters and chains, but shall be as bracelets of gold on their wrists, and rings of silver on their necks, to orna∣ment and decorate them and their children. And his words shall be sweet in the mouth, but very bitter in the belly.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="024407_0099_0FC708837896E870"/>MOREOVER, he will threaten them, that if they will not obey his voice, he will whistle with his lips, and <HI>raw-head</HI> and <HI>bloody-bones</HI> shall come out of <HI>France</HI> to devour them and their little ones; and he will blow with his horn, and the wild bull of <HI>Spain</HI> will come and gore them with his horns, and trample upon them with his hoofs, even until they die. And he shall stand upon <HI>Mount-seir,</HI> and shall pun upon Mount-seir in the face of all the people. And all the people shall laugh him to scorn.</P>
<P>AND it shall come to pass that certain other wise men shall also stand up and oppose themselves to <HI>Cato</HI>; and shall warn the people not to trust in the allurements of his voice, nor be terrified with his threats, and to hearken to his puns no more. And they shall encourage the people to go on with the work they had taken in hand, according to the words of their prophet. And they shall earnestly exhort the people to despise and reject the fetters of gold and the chains of silver, which the king of the islands would fasten upon them.</P>
<P>AND one of these wise men shall call himself CASSANDRA, and the other shall call himself THE FORESTER: and they shall fall upon <HI>Cato,</HI> and
<PB N="96" REF="024407_0100_0FC7088506730BF8"/>
shall strip him of every disguise, and shew him na∣ked before all the people. And <HI>Cassandra</HI> shall tie him up, and the <HI>Forester</HI> shall scourge him until he shall become exceeding sore. Never∣theless, <HI>Cato</HI> shall not repent, but shall harden his heart, and become very stubborn, and shall be vexed till he die. And when he shall be dead, his funeral oration shall be pronounced. And the heads of the people shall order that his funeral oration be printed; that all men may know of his death. Howbeit, in those days, it shall not be customary for the heads of the people to desire that funeral orations should be printed; yet that all men may know of <HI>Cato's</HI> death, and that the people may be delivered from the fear of the raw-head and bloody-bones of <HI>France,</HI> and the wild bull of <HI>Spain,</HI> his funeral oration shall be printed.</P>
<P>AND in process of time, the people shall root up the rotten tree, and in its place they shall plant a young and vigourous tree, and shall effectually defend it from the winds of the <HI>North</HI> by an high wall. And they shall dress it, and prune it, and cultivate it to their own good liking. And the young tree shall grow and flourish and spread its branches far abroad: and the people shall dwell under the shadow of its branches, and shall become
<PB N="97" REF="024407_0101_0FC708866F4D5448"/>
an exceeding great, powerful, and happy nation. And of their encrease there shall be no end.</P>
<P>AND <HI>Cato</HI> and his works shall be no more re∣membered amongst them. For <HI>Cato</HI> shall die, and his works shall follow him.</P>

<HEAD>TRANSLATION OF A LETTER, WRITTEN BY A FOREIGNER ON HIS TRAVELS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>London,
<DATE>Dec. 3, 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR COUNT,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE now been six months in England, and eight weeks in this metropolis. You should have heard from me before; but my frequent avoca∣tions, as well as the want of a suitable opportunity, have prevented. Agreeably to my promise, however, I now sit down to give you some ac∣count of the character and politics of this strange people. So copious a subject cannot be discussed in one letter; but you shall hear from me again, when further observation shall have enabled me to be more particular.</P>
<P>THE general character of the English is certain∣ly the most fantastic and absurd that ever fell to the lot of any known nation. As they are made up of contradictions, it would be unjust to give them any uniform designation. There is scarce a
<PB N="99" REF="024407_0103_0FC70898E57C6B98"/>
virtue that adorns the mind, or a vice that disgraces human nature, but may be ascribed to them as part of their national character. But the former are often rendered ineffectual by misapplication, and the latter qualified by a levity of manners, which shews them not to be constitutionally preva∣lent. An Englishman will treat his enemy with great generosity, and his friend with ingratitude and inhumanity. He will be lavish of his wealth when he has but little of it, and become a miserly wretch when fortune pours her favours into his purse. He will brave th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ost hardships, and encounter the severest trials with heroic fortitude; and will drown or hang himself because the wind is in the east. He will lend large sums to a stranger on the slightest security, and refuse his nearest relation the means of subsistence. To-day, his heart expands with social benevolence; to-morrow, he is cold, sullen and morose—To-day, he possesses the wealth of a nabob; to-morrow, he refuses a six-pence to a beggar, lest he should himself be reduced to the want of that six-pence. In a word, contradiction and absurdity make an Englishman.</P>
<P>DURING the last century, this people hath risen in wealth, power, and prosperity; but the insta∣bility of their temper will not permit them to en∣joy with content any blessing in possession—At
<PB N="100" REF="024407_0104_0FC708A889280E20"/>
peace with all the world—feared and respected by their neighbours—an established policy, reformed religion, and extensive commerce, are circum∣stances sufficient, one would suppose, to render any people happy. But the thirst of lawless ambi∣bition can never be satisfied. The English assume to themselves the character of being the most just, generous, and humane nation in the world, and yet they encourage the <HI>African trade</HI>—a trade attended with circumstances of injustice, cruelty, and horror, that disgrace human nature; where∣by they fasten for life, the chains of servitude the most abject, and misery the most complete, on many hundreds of their fellow creatures every year.</P>
<P>THIS just and humane nation also sent one <HI>Clive</HI> to the East Indies, to secure a dominion for them there. A country which, it should seem, the Creator never intended for the English, because he had placed it on the opposite side of the globe, and made the inhabitants of a quite different com∣plexion. This <HI>Clive,</HI> however, arrived with his forces in the East Indies, and under the sanction of his most <HI>gracious</HI> Britannic majesty and <HI>a free</HI> parliament, put to death some hundred thousands of the inoffensive inhabitants, by the sword, by fa∣mine, and the most attrocious cruelties—After
<PB N="101" REF="024407_0105_0FC708A9AED43860"/>
which he retured to England with immense ri∣ches, and a wife set in diamonds, and was made a <HI>Lord</HI>—and then cut his throat with a penknife.</P>
<P>YOU will be surprised at this; but the people here were not surprised at all. It is no uncommon thing to spend an evening with a man, in all the easy gaiety of social life, and to hear next morning that he hanged himself in a stable, or practised phlebotomy on his own jugular vein with a razor.</P>
<P>THE English now govern in the East Indies with a tyranny so pure, so unadulterated with any mixture of justice or humanity, as could not have been exceeded in the reigns of the twelve Caesars.</P>
<P>THIS best of all kings has now turned his at∣tention to AMERICA. There he had three mil∣lions of subjects, who loved, honored, and obeyed him. He governed them by officers of his own ap∣pointment: he had the whole regulation of their commerce; and the over-flowings of their wealth were conducted, by easy channels, into his coffers, and into the purses of the merchants and manu∣facturers of his kingdom. But he has quarrelled with these loyal and beneficial subjects, because they
<PB N="102" REF="024407_0106_0FC708AB45C0ABE8"/>
are so obstinate that they will not acknowledge that <HI>two and two make five.</HI> Whole volumes have been written on this subject, and all the force of rea∣son and eloquence exerted to convince this wise king that he is in an error. The Americans have most emphatically beseeched him to accept of the undissembled loyalty of their hearts; de∣claring that they are satisfied that the fruits of their industry should center with him and his people, as heretofore, to enrich and aggrandise them; but humbly pray that they may not be compelled to acknowledge that <HI>two and two make five,</HI> which would be to them a most dangerous and distressing violation of truth. But this wise and humane monarch is far from being disposed to give up the point. He has rejected their pe∣titions with scorn, and spurned at their offers of affection and fidelity; and declares, that he will even risk the crown of his ancestors, but he will make the obstinate Americans subscribe to his new dogma.</P>
<P>TO this end he hath sent over, not only his own fleets and armies, but has hired a banditti of foreign mercenaries from a petty prince, who sup∣ports the splendor of his court by selling the blood of his subjects; and he has also employed negroes and wild Indians to persecute the poor Americans
<PB N="103" REF="024407_0107_0FC708B9A8BC0E08"/>
without mercy, until they shall acknowledge that <HI>two and two make five.</HI></P>
<P>AMERICA is at this time a scene of desolation and distress; a theatre whereon is acted a real tragedy, exhibiting every species of cruelty and injustice. The royal army of this most enlight∣ened of all nations are ravishing the women, mur∣dering the men, and laying waste that fertile and beautiful country, under the conduct of Lord and General <HI>Howe;</HI> who are executing their bloody mandate, with all the composure in the world. His most gracious majesty receives, from time to time, such accounts of their proceedings as they please to give him, and is as happy as such a mo∣narch can be.</P>
<P>WHO would have thought that the peaceful plains of America would be desolated because the inhabitants will not believe that <HI>two and two make five,</HI> when their good king and his wise parliament require them so to do.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, the Americans, highly resent∣ting this treatment, have declared, that they will no longer be pensioners of the smiles of such a king, or submit to a government in which they have no share, and over which they have no con∣trol,
<PB N="104" REF="024407_0108_0FC708BAEDDD93C0"/>
and which is therefore, with respect to them, a government of mere will and pleasure. They have determined to be henceforth a <HI>free</HI> peo∣ple; and have publicly avowed that they will en∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oy the inestimable, privileges of believing, and say∣ing, that <HI>two and two make only four,</HI> according to the common sense of mankind.</P>
<P>HOW this affair will terminate, God only knows: but it seems very probable, that the king of England will lose the most valuable jewel of his crown, in the pursuit of his present views.</P>
<P>YOU will say, perhaps, that the king could not act so absurdly were he not countenanced and supported in his folly by the assent of his people. But the truth is that the king, by means of his ministers hath gained such an ascendency over the parliament, which is the constitutional voice of the people, that he can obtain their sanction for any project in which their rights are not openly and directly attacked. As to the people at large, they do not trouble themselves about the right or wrong of the matter in contest. America is a great way off, and they have no feelings for what is pas∣sing there. They grumble, indeed, about the dimi∣nution of their trade in consequence of this war, but leave the discussion of national politics to their
<PB N="105" REF="024407_0109_0FC708BC82561D30"/>
parliament. The crown hath imperceptibly ex∣tended its prerogative so as to destroy the boasted balance of the British constitution; and if the king's power should be further strengthened by the subjugation of America, the people of England may bid adieu to their constitutional freedom. Some of the wisest amongst them see this, and have openly declared, that the salvation of Eng∣land depends upon the success of the Americans in the present war.</P>
<P>THIS infatuated people have wearied the world, for these hundred years with loud eulogiums liberty and their constitution; and yet they see that constitution languishing in a deep decay, with∣out making any efforts for its recovery. Amused with trifles, and accustomed to venality and cor∣ruption, they are not alarmed at the consequences of their supineness. They love to talk of their glorious constitution, because the idea is agree∣able, and they are satisfied with the idea, and they honour their king, because it is the fashion to honour the king. Half the loyalty of the nation is sup∣ported by two popular songs. viz. "<HI>Britons strike home; and God save the king.</HI> These are vo∣ciferated at taverns, over porter, punch and wine, till the imagination is heated, and the blood in a ferment, and then these pot-valiant patriots sal∣ly
<PB N="106" REF="024407_0110_0FC708C92B03B800"/>
forth and commit all manner of riot and excess in honour of their king and country.</P>
<P>THERE are fanatics in politics as well as in re∣ligion, and both are managed in the same way, viz. by keeping up the delusion in which they delight The men in power well know the weak∣ness of the multitude, and when they observe them to grow uneasy under the too barefaced en∣croachments of prerogative, they get half a do∣zen of court scribblers to expatiate on the glories of the British constitution, and to sing the sweet Lullaby of Liberty to the people—and all is well. Just so a nurse rattles three pieces of tin in a little rush basket to amuse her crying child. The poor infant thinks it has the world in possession, and is satisfied.</P>
<P>THE extreme ignorance of the common peo∣ple of this civilized country can scarce be cre∣dited. In general they know nothing beyond the particular branch of business which their parents or the parish happened to chuse for them. This, in∣deed, they practise with unremitting diligence; but never think of extending their knowledge farther.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="024407_0111_0FC708CD254584E8"/>A manufacturer has been brought up a maker of pin-heads: He has been at this business forty years, and of course makes pin-heads with great dexterity; but he cannot make a whole pin for his life. He thinks it is the perfection of hu∣man nature to make pin-heads. He leaves other matters to inferior abilities. It is enough for him, that he believes in the <HI>Athanasian Creed,</HI> re∣verences the splendor of the court, and makes pin-heads. This he conceives to be the sum-total of religion, politics, and trade. He is sure that London is the finest city in the world; black-friars bridge the most superb of all possible brid∣ges; and the river Thames, the largest river in universe. It is in vain to tell him that there are many rivers in America, in comparison of which the Thames is but a ditch; that there are single provinces there larger than all England; and that the colonies, formerly belonging to Great-Britain, now <HI>independant states,</HI> are vastly more exten∣sive than England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland, taken all together—He cannot conceive this. He goes into his best parlour, and looks on a map of England, four feet square▪ on the other side of the room he sees a map of <HI>North</HI> and South America, not more than two feet square, and exclaims— How can these things be!—It is altogether impossi∣ble! He has read the Arabian Nights Entertain∣ment,
<PB N="108" REF="024407_0112_0FC708D85FCEBEF8"/>
and he hears this wonderful account of America—he believes the one as much as the other—That a giant should rise out of the sea, or that the Delaware should be larger than the Thames, are equally incredible to him. Talk to him of the British constitution, he will tell you it is a glorious constitution—Ask him what it is, and he is ignorant of its first principles; but he is sure that he can make and sell pin-heads under it. Mention the freedom of elections, and he will tell that he does not meddle in these matters; that he lives in a borough; and that it is impossible but that squire <HI>Goose-Cap</HI> must represent that borough in parliament—because Squire <HI>Goose-Cap</HI> is ac∣quainted with the prime minister, and his Lady comes every Sunday to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e parish church in a brocaded gown; and sits in a pew lined with green cloth—How then can it be otherwise—but these are things in which he is not concerned. He believes in the Athanasian Creed, honours the king, and makes pin-heads—and what more can be expected of man.</P>
<P>IT is not so in <HI>America.</HI> The lowest tradesman there is not without some degree of general know∣ledge. They turn their hands to every thing; their situation obliges theim to do so. A farmer there cannot run to an artist upon every trifling occa∣sion—He must make and mend and contrive for
<PB N="109" REF="024407_0113_0FC708DC4D6D5CD8"/>
himself. This, I observed in my travels through that country. In many towns, and in every city, they have public libraries. Not a tradesman but will find time to read. He acquires knowledge imperceptibly. He is amused with voyages and travels, and becomes acquainted with the geogra∣phy, customs, and commerce of other countries. He reads political disquisitions, and learns the great out-lines of his rights as a man and as a citizen— He dips a little into philosophy, and knows that the apparent motion of the sun is occasioned by the real motion of the earth—In a word, he is sure that, notwithstanding the determination of king, lords, and commons to the contrary, <HI>two and two</HI> can <HI>never make five.</HI></P>
<P>SUCH are the people of England, and such the people of America. These nations are now at daggers drawn. At first, the Americans knew little or nothing of the art of war, but they im∣prove daily. The British troops are teaching them how to conquer; and they find them very apt scholars. The probable consequence is, that England will lose, and America gain, an empire. If <HI>George the Third</HI> should subjugate America on his present principles, all good men will abhor him as a tyrant; if he should fail in his project, all wise men will despise him for risking the immense
<PB N="110" REF="024407_0114_0FC708DDB8B38890"/>
advantages he derived from a friendly connection with that country.</P>

<HEAD>A POLITICAL CATECHISM: Written in 1777.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Question.</HI> WHAT is WAR?</P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> The curse of mankind; the mother of famine and pestilence; the source of compli∣cated miseries; and the undistinguishing destroy∣er of the human species.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> How is war divided?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Into <HI>offensive</HI> and <HI>defensive.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What is the general object of an offensive war?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Sometimes it is to regain by the sword what had been unjustly taken from the rightful pos∣sessor: Sometimes to prevent impending dangers, which cannot be avoided by other means: But, for the most part, it is undertaken to gratify the ambition of a prince, who wishes to subject to his arbitrary will a people whom God created free,
<PB N="112" REF="024407_0116_0FC708E4ECDD88E0"/>
and to gain an uncontrolled dominion over their rights and property.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Are there any instances of such princes?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes, many. History is filled with the wick∣ed lives and miserable deaths of tyrants. The present king of Great Britain, whose history is not yet completed, is a living example of such a prince. He carried an offensive war into the <HI>East Indies,</HI> and deprived many thousands of those in∣nocent people of their lives and property: and he is now carrying on an offensive war in <HI>America,</HI> without one specious plea of justice for so doing: Most wickedly aiming at the absolute disposal of that extensive country, and its numerous inhabi∣tants. For this purpose he has spread desolation and death amongst their friendly habitations, and prosecutes his wicked design with aggravated cru∣elty and horror.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What may justly be said of such a prince?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That he looks on his fellow-creatures as created only for his use, and makes their misery his sport. That the spirit of thousands, who have fallen a sacrifice to his ambition, flutter round the polished points of his imperial crown, and cry to
<PB N="113" REF="024407_0117_0FC708E668FC2830"/>
heaven for justice—that his throne rests on the sculls of the slain—that his unhallowed feasts are defiled with blood—and that the curses of widows and orphans are poured out against him at every rising sun.</P>
<P>THAT history will do justice to his memory, and record his crimes with his name, for the ab∣horrence of posterity—and that the blood he has wantonly spilt in unjust pursuits will most assuredly be required of his hands.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> WHAT is <HI>defensive</HI> war?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> IT is to take up arms in opposition to the in∣vasions of usurped power, and bravely suffer pre∣sent hardships, and encounter present dangers, to secure the rights of humanity, and the blessings of freedom, to generations yet unborn.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> IS even defensive war justifiable in a reli∣gious view?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> THE foundation of war is laid in the wick∣edness of mankind. Were all men just and good, there would be no cause of contention amongst them; but as the case is far otherwise, war is be∣come absolutely necessary, as many other insti∣tutions
<PB N="114" REF="024407_0118_0FC708F16A0A8AF0"/>
are, which derive their origin from the weakness or wickedness of men. Even laws and government would be useless encumbrances were there no open violence or secret treachery to be guarded against. God has given man will to con∣trive, power to execute, and freedom of will to di∣rect his conduct. It cannot be but that some, from a depravity of will, will abuse these privi∣leges, and exert these powers to the injury of o∣thers: and the oppressed would have no safety or redress but by exerting the same powers in their defence: and it is our duty to set a proper value upon, and defend to the utmost, our just rights, and the blessings of life: otherwise a few mis∣creants would tyrannise over the rest of mankind, and make the passive multitude the slaves of their power. Thus it is that <HI>defensive</HI> is not only justi∣fiable, but an indispensable duty.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> IS it upon these principles that the people of America are resisting the arms of Great-Bri∣tain, and opposing force with force?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> STRICTLY so—The Americans had nothing in view but to live peaceably and dutifully under a constitutional subjection to their acknowledged so∣vereign. They patiently submitted to many un∣just encroachments of power. They were not te∣nacious

of every right. But at last the designs of Great-Britain became too manifest to be mistaken: and the Americans were urged on to the distres∣sing necessity of chusing one of two great evils; either to enlist themselves, and their unborn poste∣rity, the unconditional slaves of a corrupt and wicked administration; or to brave the horrors of war, under every disadvantage, in a noble struggle for the rights of mankind. They have resolutely determined on the latter; and after solemnly ap∣pealing to God and the world for the justice of their cause, are prosecuting the war with promising hopes of success. Supported by the rectitude of their principles, they have surmounted the greatest difficulties, and have exhibited instances of person∣al bravery and military conduct not exceeded by the heroes of antiquity—And may Heaven prosper their virtuous undertaking!</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> BUT it has often been said, that America is in a state of rebellion. Tell me, therefore, what is REBELLION?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> IT is when a great number of people, headed by one or more factious leaders, aim at deposing their lawful prince, without any just cause of com∣plaint, in order to place another on his throne.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="024407_0120_0FC708F9EBB98EC8"/><HI>Q.</HI> IS this the case of the Americans?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> FAR otherwise.—They have repeatedly de∣clared, with the most solemn protestations, that they were ready to support, with their lives and fortunes, the present king of Great-Britain, on the throne of his ancestors; and only requested, in return the enjoyment of those rights, which the British constitution confirms to all his subjects; and without which, the boasted freedom of that consti∣tution is but a solemn mockery and an empty name.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> TO whom has the king of England commit∣ted the conduct of this war?</P>
<P><HI>A. TO Lord and General</HI> HOWE.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> WHO are these gentlemen?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> THEY are the brothers of a <HI>Colonel</HI> HOWE, who fought bravely along with the Americans in a former war between the English and French, and fell in battle. The Americans loved and honoured this <HI>Colonel Howe:</HI> they lamented his fate, and at their own expence erected a monument to his me∣mory in the town of Boston. But these gentlemen, with unrelenting hearts, and sacrilegious hands,
<PB N="117" REF="024407_0121_0FC708FDC0472AC0"/>
have defiled their brother's tomb with the blood of those whose affection had raised it to his ho∣nour; and have plunged their hostile swords into bosoms glowing with love and esteem for their mo∣ther's son.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> WHAT progress have they made in subdu∣ing America?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> VERY little.—They got possession of the town of <HI>Boston;</HI> but could not hold it. They were but tenants at will there, strictly speaking, for their landlords ejected them without any warn∣ing, and distrained for rent upon certain military stores.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What did they next?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> THEY took <HI>Staten-Island,</HI> where there was nothing to oppose them, and a part of <HI>Long-Island,</HI> and so <HI>ferried</HI> themselves over to the city of <HI>New-York.</HI> From thence they crept into <HI>Jersey,</HI> and taking advantage of a critical period, when the A∣merican troops were disbanded by the expiration of their enlistments, and before a new army could be raised, they advanced to the banks of the <HI>De∣laware,</HI> well knowing that there was nothing to oppose their progress. On the banks of the <HI>De∣laware</HI>
<PB N="118" REF="024407_0122_0FC709019B4F60F8"/>
they sat themselves down, and fell to plun∣dering the adjacent country. In the mean time they published an enticing proclamation, offering pardon and protection to all those who would ac∣cept of it, upon the easy terms of <HI>unconditional submission.</HI> But the Americans did not despair: they soon found a spirited militia to supply the place of their disbanded troops until a new army could be raised. This militia, with a small remain∣der of the regular troops, crossed the <HI>Delaware</HI> at midnight, in a snow-storm, and following their gal∣lant general through the most severe and inclement weather, unexpectedly attacked, and drove the enemy from their station in the utmost confusion, and made twelve hundred of their men prisoners of war, and then re-crossed the river to their for∣mer encampment. The British then rallied, and returned to their post, knowing that a large rein∣forcement was on the way to their relief. But the American general, having a range of fires along the banks of the river to deceive the enemy, marched his army in the night, re-crossed the <HI>De∣laware,</HI> and by a circuitous rout, surprised, attack∣ed, and defeated the enemy's expected reinforce∣ment. The royal army is now lying in <HI>Brunswick,</HI> mortified and crest-fallen.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="024407_0123_0FC70910120FEAA8"/><HI>Q.</HI> WHAT are the striking outlines of the king of England's character?</P>
<P><HI>A. Injustice, obstinacy,</HI> and <HI>folly.</HI> He is unjust, because he endeavours to get by force what is de∣nied him by the laws of the realm over which he presides, and in direct violation of his coronation oath: he is <HI>obstinate,</HI> because he refuses to hear the humble petitions of an oppressed people: and his <HI>folly</HI> is conspicuous in quarrelling with the A∣mericans who loved and honoured him—who were the faithful and zealous contributors to the support of his crown and dignity, and a never fail∣ing and encreasing source of wealth to him, and to the merchants and manufacturers of his country.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> WHO has the chief command of the Ame∣rican army?</P>
<P><HI>A. HIS Excellency</HI> GENERAL WASHINGTON.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> WHAT is his character?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> TO him the title of <HI>Excellency</HI> is applied with peculiar propriety. He is the best and the great∣est man the world ever knew. In private life, he wins the hearts and wears the love of all who are so happy as to fall within the circle of his ac∣quaintance.
<PB N="120" REF="024407_0124_0FC70911478BCEF8"/>
In his public character, he com∣mands universal respect and admiration. Consci∣ous that the principles on which he acts are indeed founded in virtue and truth, he steadily pursues the arduous work with a mind neither depressed by disappointment and difficulties, nor elated with temporary success. He retreats like a General, and attacks like a Hero. Had he lived in the days of idolatry, he had been worshipped as a God. One age cannot do justice to his merit; but a grateful posterity shall, for a succession of ages, re∣member the great deliverer of his country.</P>

<HEAD>A LETTER TO LORD HOWE.
<DATE>[December 1776.]</DATE></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHATEVER errors the court of Great Britain might have fallen into in the commencement of the present unhappy contest with America, it was at least a politic step to commit the conduct of this important affair to your Lordship, and the Ge∣neral your brother.</P>
<P>THE name of <HI>Howe</HI> is dear to America; and amongst the many distressing difficulties we have to encounter, it is no inconsiderable one to over∣come the predilection we feel for your family. The exalted virtues of your heroic brother <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Colonel Lord' Howe,</HI> was in Gen. Abercombie's army at the battle of Ticonderoga, and was there killed by a random shot. The town of Boston erected a Monument to his memory.</NOTE>, whose bones are embraced by that soil you are now drenching with blood, often rise in painful re∣membrance.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="024407_0126_0FC7091B9AAEFE60"/>WE are ready to acknowledge the good dispo∣sitions that distinguish your private character, and whilst we feel the smart of the wounds you inflict, wish they had been administered by another hand. We would fondly consider you as the exe∣cutioner of another's wrath—not your own: and forgive with as much sincerity—pardon the allu∣sion!—as the condemned wretch forgives the ap∣pointed officer who is about to torture him into another state of existence.</P>
<P>THE idea we have of your Lordship's character compels us to suppose, that before you undertook this cruel task your conscience was fully convin∣ced, that the inflexible rules of right and ho∣nour, and the spirit of the British constitution, fully authorised the present war: and that the resistance of America to the claims of the Bri∣tish legislature is, and ought to be, deemed <HI>rebelli∣on.</HI> Under such a supposition, can we blame your Lordship for asserting and enforcing what you may believe to be the rights of your sovereign.</P>
<P>LET the same candour be extended to the poor Americans. They think and are fully per∣suaded, that neither the rules of honour or e∣quity, the spirit of the British constitution, or the rights of mankind, can authorise the views of Bri∣tain
<PB N="123" REF="024407_0127_0FC7091C5FAB21C8"/>
in the prosecution of the present war: on the contrary they believe, that is an indispensable duty, which they owe to themselves and their un∣born posterity, to oppose to the utmost the troops you have brought into their country, and to re∣fuse submission to the yoke that is prepared for them. Ought they not then to be respected as ac∣ting upon the best principles, however ill-founded you may suppose these principles to be? And ought you not at least to pity, whilst you think you justly punish?</P>
<P>THE present dispute is, what the rights of the crown and parliament are with respect to Ameri∣ca, and what they are not—Great Britain would have us acknowledge her claims of unlimited pow∣er; and that too, without reasoning on the sub∣ject—she will not condescend to reason with us— she will not receive our humble petitions, or even hear what we have to say in our own behalf—we must implicitly acknowledge her claims to be just. And when, my Lord, were acknowledgements of this kind ever forced upon mankind with success? To own the supremacy of the British parliament over the lives and properties of the people of A∣merica, or own the supremacy of his holiness over our immortal souls, are doctrines which can only be established by the sword and the faggot amongst
<PB N="124" REF="024407_0128_0FC709263280C1B8"/>
men who have the free use of their reason. But I am, perhaps, going too far—I mean not to offend, nor would I be wanting in the respect due to your character and station. Should my zeal on so interesting a subject appear somewhat intemperate, I trust your Lordship will make a proper allow∣ance, yet suffer me to shed a few tears over the mangled limbs of my bleeding country.</P>
<P>KNOW then, that devastation, insult, murder, and ruin mark the way of your savage troops through this cultivated, hospitable, and once happy land. It is not enough that the manly youth, with a heart high-beating in his country's cause, is cal∣led forth, and cut down in the field of battle, an early sacrifice at the shine of Liberty; but the voice of the helpless virgin cries aloud to Heaven against the brutal force of the salacious ravisher. Take a view of the country before you—villages in ruin, cities abandoned, and the miserable in∣habitants driven from their comfortable homes, and all the endearing sweets of domestic felicity, to seek for shelter in this inclement season— they know not where—leaving their property a prey to unpitying foreigners, who destroy, without remorse, what they cannot immediately use or conveniently take away. This is no ex∣aggerated picture, over-charged in the colouring
<PB N="125" REF="024407_0129_0FC7092BEFA25218"/>
—facts have justified the drawing, and the mourn∣ful occasion prompts the stile.</P>
<P>SUCH is the nature of the commission you have come to execute amongst us. Cruel as it is, I would fain hope that you think you are only bran∣dishing the sword of justice, not inflicting the rod of oppression—but how you can think so, it is hard for an American to conceive.</P>
<P>THE unpardonable <HI>fault</HI> of America <HI>now</HI> is the declaration of <HI>Independence.</HI> When our faults were less they were as hardly thought of. Our modest complaints were called presumption—our humble petitions dismissed with contempt—no le∣nient hand was held out—no friendly measures proposed to sooth the griefs we thought we suffer∣ed, and prevent the horrors that now surround us —<HI>independence</HI> was not the wish of America, but a hard and cruel necessity has forced us to this despe∣rate determination—we trust in the justice of our cause, and leave to the God of battles the great event.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, though you carry on your master's work, let not the lawless hand of rapine spread unnecessary desolation through our bleeding country—Arrest the plunderer's greedy grasp,
<PB N="126" REF="024407_0130_0FC7092FC4E56330"/>
and suffer not the cries of the despoiled virgin to call to Heaven for vengeance on those who regard not God, and trample on the sacred rights of hu∣manity. Wrongs like these, tarnish the lustre of victory, and blast the laurels of the brave.</P>

<HEAD>A LETTER TO JOSEPH GALLOWAY, ESQ. [Published in 1778.]</HEAD>
<P>NOW that you have gained the summit of your ambitious hopes, the reward of your forfeited ho∣nour, that dear bought gratification, to obtain which you have given your name to infamy, and your soul to perdition—now that you fit in Phila∣delphia, the <HI>nominal</HI> governor of Pennsylvania, give me leave to address a few words of truth to your corrupted heart. Retire for a moment from the avocations and honours of your new superin∣tendency, and review the steps by which you have mounted the stage of power—steps reeking with the blood of your innocent country.</P>
<P>WHEN the storm was gathering dark and drea∣ry over this devoted country—when America stood in need of all the exertions which her best patriots and most confidential citizens could make, you stepped forward—you offered yourself a can∣didate, and with unwearied diligence solicited a
<PB N="128" REF="024407_0132_0FC709322E922268"/>
seat in the American congress. Your seeming sincerity, and your loud complaints against the un∣just usurpations of the British legislature, gained the confidence of your country. You were elect∣ed—you took your seat in congress—and let pos∣terity remember, that while you were vehemently declaiming in that venerable senate against British tyranny, and with hypocritical zeal urging a noble stand in behalf of the liberties of your country, you were at the same time betraying their secrets, ridiculing their oeconomy, and making sport of their conduct, in private letters to your friend go∣vernor ********.</P>
<P>BUT your abilities were not equal to your trea∣chery. Your character became suspected. You were left out of the delegation, and fearing the just resentment of your injured country, you took refuge under the banners of General <HI>Howe.</HI> You well knew that professions alone would not recom∣mend you to his notice: actual services must be rendered to raise you above neglect, and even con∣tempt of your new patron. The general knowing your conduct to have been such as to render all re∣conciliation with your country impossible, and thinking that from your knowledge of the people he meant to ruin, you might be a useful tool in his hands, took you into his service. You found it
<PB N="129" REF="024407_0133_0FC70938562E7F50"/>
no hard task to come into his views; to banish every virtuous sensibility, and even steel your heart against the cries of suffering humanity, and wade through the blood of your fellow-citizens to your promised reward. Is there a curse denounced a∣gainst villainy that hangs not over your head?—It was owing to your poisonous influence that *—* took part against his country's cause, and involved his family in misery and distress. Let their misfor∣tunes sit heavy on your soul! It was owing to your seductions that a hopeful young man was cut off with infamy in the prime and vigour of life.—Let the blood of <HI>Molesworth</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was detected in endeavouring to procure pilots to conduct the British fleet up the Delaware; was tried, convicted, and hanged.</NOTE> sit heavy on your soul! You attended the British army from the <HI>Head of Elk</HI> to the city of Philadelphia—you rode in the rear of that army in your triumphant carriage—you feasted your eyes with scenes of desolation—the cries of ruined families, and the curses of the distress∣ed, composed the music of your march, and your horses hoofs were wet with the blood of your slaugh∣tered countrymen and former friends.—Is there a curse denounced against villainy that hangs not over your head?—Let these things sit heavy on your soul!</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="024407_0134_0FC7093C1144C6C0"/>BUT you are now in the seat of power in the city of Philadelphia. The glow of gratified am∣bition burns on your cheek, whilst like a bashaw of the east, you order this or that fellow-citizen to prison and punishment. You sit down daily to a board spread with more than plenty, and know, with unconcern, that numbers of your country∣men, even some of your former acquaintance, are suffering all the lingering anguish of absolute fa∣mine in the jails of the city—within your reach— within your power to relieve. You well know that under the discipline of that arch-fiend, <HI>Cun∣ningham,</HI> they have plucked the weeds of the earth for food, and expired with the unchewed grass in their mouths <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cunningham</HI> had deserted from the Americans to the British, and was made keeper of the provost prison. The state-house in Philadelphia was made use of for this purpose; and the author was assured, by some who made their escape from thence, that they had seen bodies lying in the yard of prisoners, who had died of mere famine, with unchewed grass hanging out of their mouths. Some of the citizens had one day sent a bucket full of broth to the prison∣ers of the provost—the infernal <HI>Cunningham</HI> took it into the state-house yard, and when the starving wretches had gathered eagerly round, he kicked over the bucket with his foot, and then laughed to see them lie on their bellies and lap the slop from the ground, like dogs, with their tongues.</NOTE>—yet you pity not the misery to which you have yourself been instrumental, nor will you suffer their torture to touch your heart— Oh! let this too, sit heavy on your soul!</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="024407_0135_0FC7093D6509D3A8"/>THE time is at hand when the army on which you build your support must withdraw, and aban∣don their vain attempt, When this shall happen, then fly—fly to England, for you will not be safe here—your life and estate are both forfeited—and both will be but a poor atonement for the wrongs you have done.—Fly to England, and if you should find yourself despised and neglected there, as will most probably be the case, for the English hate a traitor, even though they benefit by the treason— then fly thence, with the monster <HI>Cunningham,</HI> to the barren desert, and herd with hungry beasts of prey.</P>
<P>THE temporary reward of iniquity you now hold will soon shrink from your grasp; and the favour of him on whom you now depend will cease, when your capacity to render the necessary services shall cease. This you know, and the re∣flection must even now throw a gloom of horror over your enjoyments, which the glittering tinsel of your new superintendency cannot illumine.— Look back, and all is guilt—look forward, and all is dread.—When the history of the present times shall be recorded, the names of <HI>Galloway</HI> and <HI>Cun∣ningham</HI> will not be omitted; and posterity will wonder at the extreme obduracy of which the hu∣man heart is capable, and at the unmeasurable dis∣tance between a traitor and a WASHINGTON.</P>

<HEAD>TWO LETTERS [Published in 1776.]</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="letter">
<OPENER><SALUTE>MR. PRINTER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM <HI>a Tory,</HI> the son of a Tory, born and bred in the pure principles of unconditional submis∣sion, and a true friend to the Hanoverian family— right or wrong and at all events. The king of England, is in my humble opinion, entitled, <HI>jure divino,</HI> to govern absolutely, not only the British empire, but the East and West Indies—not only the East and West Indies, but the continent of North America—not only these, but even the whole of this paltry world.</P>
<P>BUT the infatuated people of this most vile portion of this most vile planet, have been moved by the instigation of the Devil to oppose the ear∣nest desire of George III.—God bless his Maje∣sty!—to govern them <HI>in all cases whatever,</HI> accor∣ding to his good will and pleasure, For my own
<PB N="133" REF="024407_0137_0FC709469FDEC0A0"/>
part, I truly abominate and abhor their rebelli∣ous obstinacy. His Majesty hath been pleased, in his great goodness, and to my unspeakable satis∣faction, to send over his fleets and armies to con∣quer and subdue this horrible country. Now, it is the indispensable duty of all those who would be called the friends of arbitrary government and of the said George III. to render all the assistance in their power to the aforesaid fleets and armies, and to the worthy Lords and Generals, whom this just and benign monarch hath commissioned to direct and manage them.</P>
<P>AMONGST the implements of war, the Pen and the printing Press are not the most insignifi∣cant. It is true, they can break no bones—can shed no blood—but they can instigate men to do both: and by their influence over the minds of the multitude, can, perhaps, do more towards gaining a point, or opposing a purpose, than the sword or the bayonet. For this reason, I have anxiously desired to see a printing press in this ci∣ty subservient to the purposes of Lord and Ge∣neral Howe; and it is with great satisfaction I find they have at last got a printer to their mind— one perfectly disposed to forward their humane designs. I was boasting, in the fulness of my heart, of <HI>The Pennsylvania Ledger,</HI> printed by Mr
<PB N="134" REF="024407_0138_0FC7094D2B1D1818"/>
<HI>Humphreys,</HI> to a friend whom I supposed to be a tory like myself: but I had quite mis∣taken my man. He had the assurance to address me on the subject in the following manner. I will give it nearly in his own words, that you may see what dangerous characters we have amongst us.</P>
<P><Q>IT has been the policy of every government, (said he) from the beginning of time to this day, when the honour, safety, and existence of that government depended on the fate of war, to use every possible means to forward and strengthen the efforts of its citizens and friends, and to counteract the force and subtlety of its enemies.</Q></P>
<P><Q>FOR this end, even under the most popular constitutions, many of the sacred rights of the people have been hard pressed, and even suspen∣ded, and that without endangering the consti∣tution, provided such extraordinary exertions of government be manifestly sanctioned by the necessity of the case. The British king, with∣out even the plea of necessity impresses men for supplying his navy in time of war; a practice not authorised by the constitution, and
<PB N="135" REF="024407_0139_0FC70956F4EAA568"/>
a high infringement of the personal rights of the subject.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE liberty of the press has ever been justly esteemed as one of the most important popular privileges in a free government. It is indeed highly reasonable that the channels of informa∣tion should be kept open and uncorrupted—and no man holds this right in more sacred estimation than I do. But when this privilege is manifest∣ly abused, and the press becomes an engine in the hands of an enemy for sowing dangerous dissen∣tions, spreading false alarms, and undermining the defensive operations of government in an hour of danger, ought not that government upon the undeniable principles of self-preserva∣tion, to silence, by its own authority, such an in∣ternal enemy to its peace and safety?—I have now in view <HI>The Pennsylvania Ledger,</HI> a paper mani∣festly in the interests of the enemy: whether we consider the complexion of the paper itself, or the known political character of the editor. Why should a dangerous lenity protect a man in the abuse of that very lenity which is his only security, and on which he so ungratefully presumes? or why should he, under the sanction of one right, be permitted to aim at the subver∣sion of all the other rights of his country?
<PB N="136" REF="024407_0140_0FC7095864D49AA8"/>
Would not our council of safety be very justifi∣able in silencing a press, whose weekly producti∣ons insult the feelings of the people, and are so openly inimical to the American cause?</Q></P>
<P>DID you ever hear such a fellow? For my part I was so shocked at his principles, that I left him abruptly, and am determined to have no more communication with him.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="letter">
<PB N="137" REF="024407_0141_0FC7095A29630820"/>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MR. PRINTER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is not easy to conceive how much I was sur∣prised and disappointed at the discourse of my friend, as communicated to you in my last. There are indeed some whom we confide in with safety in these precarious times: and people should be very cautious in opening their minds before persons of a doubtful political character.</P>
<P>IT is a rule in our tory society to be very cir∣cumspect in this particular—But I confess that, in this instance, I was not as prudent as I should have been; and I have had the mortification of be∣ing reprimanded for my indiscretion before a full meeting.</P>
<P>YOU can hardly imagine what regularity pre∣vails in our board of tories. We are all formed into committees of various denominations, and appointed to various duties. I have myself the honour to belong to <HI>the committee of wiles and stra∣tagems.</HI> It was I, Mr. Printer, who planned the scheme for stealing the mail sent by General Wash∣ington
<PB N="138" REF="024407_0142_0FC709609C8B6F20"/>
to congress <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By this Mail (which was stole from off the express horse, whilst he was refreshing himself at Bristol) Gen. Howe was infor∣med of the situation of the American army, and of the day on which most of the troops would be disbanded by the expiration of their enlistments. He accordingly came into Jersey with his whole force at the critical time and drove Gen. Washington over the Delaware.</NOTE>.—And my design was so successfully executed, that whilst the committee of congress were searching Bristol for those letters, they were then on their way to our friend <HI>General Howe;</HI> where they safely arrived, as we have been since informed. You may be sure that I gained great applause for this manoeuvre.</P>
<P>WE have also a <HI>committee of false reports;</HI>— whose duty is to fabricate and publish such articles of intelligence as may tend to alarm and terrify timid whigs, and distract the minds of the people. These are circulated at such times as the situation of public affairs may make them most probable. Sometimes they are thrown out in whispers, in so dark and secret a manner that their origin cannot be traced; and at other times openly, by means of the <HI>Pennsylvania Ledger.</HI></P>
<P>WE have, moreover a <HI>committee of true intelligence;</HI> whose business it is to employ a number of spies, who are directed to mix amongst the people in the assumed character of zealous whigs; to hire
<PB N="139" REF="024407_0143_0FC709621F1C6E88"/>
themselves as servants and waiters in houses and taverns frequented by members of congress. This committee holds a regular correspondence with our friends in the British army; so that we are certainly informed of what passes on both sides, from the best authority, and are thereby enabled to take all advantages. Happily for us, the several ferries and stages have as yet been left free and open, so that our messengers pass and re∣pass without examination, and of consequence this department has been attended with little or no difficulty.</P>
<P>ANOTHER committee is called the <HI>committee of lies:</HI> whose duty differs from that of <HI>false reports</HI> in this—the latter is to circulate misrepresentations of facts respecting the armies, and things of a public nature, on the large scale: whilst the former only frame temporary lies for the use of this city: particularly respecting the deliberations and in∣tentions of congress. These lies must be fresh and fresh every day; and always supported by a strong assertion that the information came from some leaky member of congress; generally without mentioning the name of any individual member; yet, in cases of urgency, the real name of some leading character may be adduced; when the lie
<PB N="140" REF="024407_0144_0FC7096C2C151090"/>
may have had its operation before it can be contra∣dicted.</P>
<P>THERE is likewise a <HI>committee of extortion;</HI> these are wealthy men, who monopolize, as far as they can, the articles most wanted for the rebel army; buy up the necessaries of life, and put on them the highest prices they can with any appear∣ance of propriety, in order to make the people discontented and uneasy.</P>
<P>THE last committee I shall mention is <HI>the com∣mittee of depreciation—as important as any</HI>—they are to take all possible pains, and to exercise every subtile art to run down and depreciate the Conti∣nental currency. This committee is very large, and composed chiefly of brokers and monied men. They get some of this money, and run with it to discharge any debts they may have contracted, with a seeming anxiety to get rid of it as fast as possible. If they have goods for sale, they openly avow three prices: one, if the purchaser will agree to pay in hard money; an higher price, if in pro∣vincial paper, under the old government; and a still higher, if in the present continental bills of credit. But we have many other ways of bring∣ing that currency into disrepute, which I am not at liberty to mention.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="024407_0145_0FC7096E282D9948"/>I would give a list of the men of most influence in our society—at present this would be impro∣per: but I will be more explicit hereafter, when <HI>toryism</HI> may be more safely and openly avowed.</P>
<P>SOME narrow minded people say, that we are do∣ing all we can to ruin our country, and entail a mi∣serable slavery on our unborn posterity. We believe we are doing the best we can for ourselves—and pray what has posterity done for us, that we should run the risk of confiscation and a halter for them? Our fixed opinion is, that the British army must e∣ventually subdue this country—and setting the right or wrong of the thing out of the question, we think we may as well have the reputation and ad∣vantage of assisting them in their designs as not. 'Tis true, if the British Generals should succeed in their enterprise we may see our neighbours and friends imprisoned by hundreds, and hanged by dozens; their estates confiscated, and their chil∣dren turned out to beggary and want; but then we shall ourselve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> escape, and enjoy in safety our lives and estates—and, perhaps, be even promoted, for our present services, to places of honour and emolument.</P>

<HEAD>A LETTER TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW JERSEY GAZETTE.
<DATE>[January 1778.]</DATE></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MR. COLLINS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN necessity first compelled us to take up arms in defence of our country, we thought our only business would be to oppose strength to strength, in the usual course of war: and accord∣ingly, we provided ourselves with guns, bayonets, powder, ball, &amp;c.</P>
<P>BUT experience shews that we were mistaken. Other weapons of less mortal, but not less dan∣gerous effect, are exercised against us by the ene∣my, and we are very deficient on our parts. It is now high time that congress should enable us to meet the foe with equal arms. In short, Mr. Col∣lins, we want men of abilities to serve the United States in the capacity of <HI>public Liars.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="024407_0147_0FC709711E03E620"/>HOWEVER strange such an appointment may appear at first view, we find that the experienced commanders of the British army have not thought it unworthy of their attention. It is manifest that our enemies depend much on their superiority in the art of <HI>lying.</HI> In the very commencement of the war, the British minister was at the trouble and expence of sending over a whole ship load of lies in a pamphlet, entitled <HI>An Address to the People of America,</HI> to be dispersed among the people. After this, many other lying pamphlets and papers were discharged from the royal batteries. Lord <HI>Howe</HI> sent a lie to congress by Gen. <HI>Sullivan,</HI> request∣ing a conference for the establishment of peace— knowing, at the same time, he had neither the in∣tention nor the power to make peace. But this was only priming the cannon—his principal aim was to send a thundering lie to Europe, and particularly to <HI>France,</HI> informing that congress was about to submit, and had actually entered up∣on a treaty with the British generals for that pur∣pose. And Sir <HI>William Howe</HI> let off another <HI>lie,</HI> not long since, by means of the unfortunate <HI>John Brown</HI>—but that missed its aim.</P>
<P>AS soon as the <HI>Howes</HI> got to New York, they appointed their <HI>liar general,</HI> who played off in∣numerable lies from the batteries of <HI>Rivington</HI>
<PB N="144" REF="024407_0148_0FC70978E970C3C0"/>
and <HI>Gaine</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Printers of Newspapers.</NOTE> to our great annoyance. They have now an able officer of this kind in Philadelp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, who has taken charge of Fort <HI>Humphreys</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Printers of Newspapers.</NOTE> and Fort <HI>Town</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Printers of Newspapers.</NOTE>. For it cannot be supposed that Mess. <HI>Humphreys</HI> and <HI>Town</HI> are the original au∣thors of those elegant and well constructed lies which they publish every week.</P>
<P>I have heard of a man in England, some years ago, called a Ventriloquist, who had the extraor∣dinary faculty of making his voice seem to come from where he pleased. This man kept a great dog, and for the entertainment of his visitors, would throw his voice into the dog's belly; and then wagging the poor beast's jaws with his hands, made him seem to say any thing he pleased. Thus it is with <HI>Humphreys</HI> and <HI>Town. The liar general</HI> is the man with a wonderful voice, and they are only his dogs, whom he causes to utter what he thinks proper. Thus, in a late Evening Post, Mr. <HI>Town</HI> seems to address the public, in <HI>propria persona,</HI> in a long declamation on con∣gressional tyranny and British clemency—All <HI>lies</HI>—in order to introduce two greater lies, sanc∣tified by the name of <HI>Joseph Galloway</HI>—whom, to tell the truth, I do suspect to be the very <HI>liar general</HI> himself.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="024407_0149_0FC7097BF0BFD008"/>NOTHING would be more vain than to attempt to counteract these productions of the British <HI>lying offices</HI> in New York and Philadelphia, with se∣rious answers of truth and reason: like must be opposed to like—and therefore I hope that con∣gress will no longer delay to establish <HI>lying offices</HI> on our side of the question, with handsome salaries annexed: and would earnestly recommend this my project to their serious consideration. Let there be an advertisement forthwith published by authority, to the following effect:</P>
<P><Q>WANTED, for the continental service, a person well qualified for the office of <HI>liar general</HI> to the United States: Also three assistants or <HI>petit-liars,</HI> in said office. Those who are willing and able to serve their country in this de∣partment, are requested to send in their names to **** on or before the first day of March next.</Q></P>
<P><Q>AS it is supposed there may be a number of persons well versed in this art amongst the <HI>tories,</HI> free pardon and good encouragement will be gi∣ven to such as will exert their lying faculties in favour of their country.</Q></P>
<P><Q>N. B. Specimens of ability will be required of the candidates.</Q></P>

<HEAD>AN ANSWER TO GENERAL BURGOYNE'S PROCLAMATION.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When <HI>General Burgoyne</HI> undertook his unsuccessful expedition from Canada, he addressed the inhabitants of the country through which he was to march in a most absurd and ridiculous proclamation: thinking to over-awe them by a pompous parade of his titles and honours, and to terrify them by an inflated and bombastic stile. In this ironical answer, the lines distinguished by Italics are literal quo∣tations from the general's famous proclamation.</NOTE></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>To <HI>John Burgoyne, esq. lieutenant-general of his majesty's armies in America; colonel of the queen's regiment of light dragoons; governor of Fort-William in North-Britain; one of the representa∣tives of the commons of Great-Britain; and com∣manding an army and fleet employed on an expedi∣tion from Canada, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Most high! most mighty! most puissant, and sub∣lime lieutenant-general!</P>
<P>WHEN the forces under your command arriv∣ed at Quebec, <HI>in order to act in concert and upon a common principle with the numerous fleets and armies which already display in every quarter of Ameri∣ca,
<PB N="147" REF="024407_0151_0FC70983B0FF0F70"/>
the justice and mercy of your king;</HI> we the rep∣tiles of America, were seized with unusual trepi∣dation and confounded with dismay. But what words can express the plenitude of our horror when the colonel of the queen's regiment of light dragoons advanced towards Ticonderoga. The mountains trembled before thee, and the trees of the forest bowed their lofty heads: the vast lakes of the west were chilled at thy presence, and the stu∣pendous cataract of <HI>Niagara</HI> bellowed at thy ap∣proach.—Judge then, oh! ineffable governor of Fort-William in North-Britain! what must have been the consternation, terror, and despair of us miserable Americans, whilst in your irresistible ad∣vances you laid all waste with fire and sword, more fully to display <HI>the justice and mercy</HI> of your king. Dark and dreary was the prospect before us, till, like the sun in the east, your most generous, most sublime, and inimitable proclamation shed abroad the cheering rays of protection and mercy, and shone upon the only path that could lead us from the pit of annihilation.</P>
<P>WE foolishly thought, ignorant as we were, that your gracious master's fleet and armies were come to destroy us and subdue our country; but we are most happy in hearing from you—and who can doubt what one of the representatives of the com∣mons
<PB N="148" REF="024407_0152_0FC70984DBC125F8"/>
of Great-Britain asserts? that they were <HI>cal∣led forth for the sole purpose of restoring the rights of the constitution to a froward and stubborn gene∣ration.</HI></P>
<P>AND is it for this, oh, sublime lieutenant-general of his majesty's armies in America! that you have left the commons of Great-Britain to shift for themselves, and crossed the wide Atlantic; and shall we most ungratefully decline the profered blessing? <HI>To restore the rights of the constitution,</HI> you have collected an amiable host of savages, and turned them loose to scalp our wives and children, and to desolate our country. This they have ac∣tually performed with their usual skill and clemen∣cy; and we yet remain insensible of the benefit— we yet remain unthankful for such unparalleled goodness.</P>
<P>OUR congress hath declared independence— and our assemblies, as your sublimity justly ob∣serves, have most wickedly imprisoned some of the avowed friends of that power with which we are at war. If we continue thus obstinate and ungrate∣ful, what can we expect, but that you should in your wrath <HI>give a stretch to the Indian forces under your direction, amounting to thousands, to overtake and destroy</HI> us; or which is still more terrible, that
<PB N="149" REF="024407_0153_0FC7098A5F4A9AD8"/>
you should withdraw your fleet and armies, and leave us to our own misery; without completing the benevolent task, of restoring to us the rights of the constitution.</P>
<P>WE submit—we submit—most puissant colonel of the queen's regiment of light dragoons, and go∣vernor of Fort-William in North-Britain! We humbly offer our heads to the tomahawk, and our bellies to the bayonet—For who can resist the power of your eloquence? Who can withstand the terror of your arms?</P>
<P>THE invitation you have given, <HI>in the conscious∣ness of Christianity, your royal master's clemency, and the honour of soldiership,</HI> we thankfully accept. The blood of the slain—the cries of violated virgi∣nity, and slaughtered infants—the never-ceasing groans of our starving brethren now languishing in the jails and prison-ships of New-York, call upon us in vain, whilst your sublime proclamation is sounding in our ears. Forgive us, oh, our coun∣try! Forgive us, dear posterity! Forgive us, all ye nations of the world, who are watching our conduct in this important struggle for the liberty and happiness of unborn millions, if we yield im∣plicitly to the fascinating eloquence of one of the representatives of the commons of Great-Britain.
<PB N="150" REF="024407_0154_0FC7099049ABC8C8"/>
Forbear then, thou magnanimous lieutenant-gene∣ral—forbear to denounce vengeance against us.— Give not <HI>a stretch</HI> to those restorers of constituti∣onal rights—the Indian forces under your direction. —Let not <HI>the messengers of justice and wrath await us in the field: and desolation, famine, and every concomitant horror bar our return</HI> to the allegiance of a prince who has taken so much pains for our reformation. We are <HI>domestic</HI>—we are <HI>industrious</HI> —we are <HI>infirm</HI> and timid—we shall <HI>remain quietly at home,</HI> and <HI>not remove our cattle, our corn, or fo∣rage,</HI> in anxious expectation that you will come <HI>at the head of troops in the full powers of health, disci∣pline, and valour,</HI> and take possession of them for yourselves.</P>
<P>BEHOLD our wives and daughters, our flocks and herds, our goods and chattels, are they not at the mercy of our lord the king, and of his lieute∣nant-general, member of the house of commons, and governor of Fort-William in North-Britain, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>For the Pennsylvania Packet.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A long and malignant contest in the public papers, of too per∣sonal a nature to be generally interesting, and continued to a most unreasonable length, occasioned this publication; which was success∣ful in putting an immediate end to that disagreeable altercation.</NOTE></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MR. PRINTER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING observed with real concern, that our newspapers have for a long time past been filled with private contests and personal calumny, to the great abuse of the liberty of the press, and disho∣nour of our city; I, who have ever been ambitious of devising something for the public good, never before devised or thought of by any schemer what∣ever, set my wits to work to remedy this growing evil, and to restore our gazettes, advertisers, jour∣nals, and packets to their original design, and make them the vehicles of intelligence, not the common sewers of scandal.</P>
<P>TO convince you that I am not altogether un∣qualified for this purpose, you must know that I have had a tolerable education in the charity-school belonging to our university. My parents being
<PB N="152" REF="024407_0156_0FC70995E4106C00"/>
poor bound me to a scrivener. My master soon discovered in me an aptitude for business; and as I wrote a good hand, he took me from the menial labours of the kitchen to assist him in his office; where I engrossed deeds, leases, wills, &amp;c. and af∣ter a little practice, was able to do the chief part of his business for him.</P>
<P>WHEN I had completed my apprenticeship, I left the scrivener and set up for myself. I served as clerk in the offices of several successive mayors, aldermen, and justices of the peace—and, to my honour be it recorded, my employers frequently applied to my judgement in difficult cases—and I venture to say—but with all due deference—that my advice contributed not a little to support their worship's official reputation.</P>
<P>NOW for my project—which after much labo∣rious study I have completed, and generously give to the public without any prospect of reward; save only the reputation of being the author of so ingenious and salutary a scheme.</P>
<P>LET there be a new court of justice established, under the name and stile of <HI>The High Court of Honour</HI>: To consist of twelve impartial and judi∣cious men, annually elected by the freemen of the
<PB N="153" REF="024407_0157_0FC7099762134FF8"/>
state. In which election all persons of what degree or quality soever (slaves excepted) shall be en∣titled to vote—strangers also excepted, who have not resided one year in the city or county where they would vote. This court when met shall chuse one of their body for president, and also appoint some suitable person to serve as clerk: and shall have jurisdiction in all matters of contro∣versy between man and man, of what kind soever they be, provided no property real or personal shall come in question, so as to be affected by the final judgment of the said court. It shall deter∣mine on differences in opinion—points of honour —ceremony—rank and precedence in all cases of affronts—flights—abuse—scandal, slander, and ca∣lumny—and in all other matters of contest; ex∣cept as before excepted. Nine judges shall make a quorum, and a majority of voices shall deter∣mine the judgment of the court—and from their decision there shall be no appeal.</P>
<P>THE clerk shall keep a large bound book, to be entitled <HI>The Rascal's Record.</HI> In which shall be fairly entered, in alphabetical order, the names, occupations, and places of residence of those on whom the judgment of the court shall fall; which book shall at all times be open to inspection, on paying the clerk <HI>sixpence</HI> specie for every search,
<PB N="154" REF="024407_0158_0FC70998F5E99AF0"/>
and one shilling for a certified extract. And if after the establishment of this court, any person or persons shall presume to decide any point of honour, contest, or squabble, by duel, or by ap∣peals to the public, in any newspaper, hand-bill, or pamphlet, such offence shall be deemed a con∣tempt of the high court of honour: and the par∣ty or parties so offending shall be rendered infa∣mous, by having their names respectively entered in the <HI>Rascal's Record.</HI></P>
<P>AND the form or process of the court shall be as follows—If any man hath cause of offence a∣gainst another, he shall apply to the clerk of the court for a <HI>declaration.</HI> These declara∣tions shall be fairly printed on good paper, with suitable blanks for the names of the parties, dates, &amp;c. And the plaintiff applying shall pay eighteen pence for the blank and six pence for fill∣ing it up, attesting it, and entering the action on the docket. And the party shall, in the presence of the clerk, sign the said declaration with his own hand; or if that cannot be, shall make his mark. After which the clerk shall number and file the said declaration.</P>
<P>ON notice from the clerk that such a declara∣tion hath been filed, the judges shall meet and
<PB N="155" REF="024407_0159_0FC709A208C25AF8"/>
agree on a time and place for hearing the cause; to which the accusers and accused shall be sum∣moned to attend, with their respective witnesses. No council shall be admitted in this court; but the parties shall personally plead their own causes. After a full hearing, the court shall give their final sentence or decree. If judgment shall be against the <HI>accusee,</HI> his name, &amp;c. shall be entered on the <HI>rascal's record,</HI> with a number, in a column for the purpose, referring to the number of the de∣claration filed. But if the <HI>accuser</HI> shall fail to make good his charge or charges against the <HI>ac∣cusee, his</HI> name, even the name of the <HI>accuser,</HI> shall be entered as aforesaid, on the rascal's re∣cord. And thus shall all controversies be insti∣tuted, conducted, and determined in the <HI>high court of honour.</HI></P>
<P>AND the form of the declaration shall be as follows, viz.</P>
<P><Q>KNOW ALL MEN, by these presents, that I A. B. of the city of Philadelphia—do announce, pronounce, attest, and declare, that my friend and fellow citizen C. D. of the same city—is a rogue, a rascal, a villain, a thief, and a scoundrel: that he is a tory, a traitor, a conspirator, and a rebel: That he is
<PB N="156" REF="024407_0160_0FC709A52B4295C0"/>
a forestaller, a regrator, a monopolizer, a spe∣culator, and a depreciator: That he is a back∣biter, a slanderer, a calumniator, and a liar. That he is a mean, dirty, stinking, sniveling, sneaking, pimping, pocket-picking-d—d son of a bitch. And I do further declare, that all and every of the above appellations are intended, and ought to be taken, construed, and under∣stood <HI>in the most opprobrious sense of the words.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An expression used by one of the writers in the quarrel al∣luded to.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P><Q>IN testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand at Philadelphia this — day of — in the year —.</Q></P>
<P><Q>NOW THE CONDITION of the above declara∣tion is such, that if the aforesaid A. B. the ac∣cuser, shall well and truly support, maintain, and verify before the judges of the <HI>high court of honour,</HI> any one or more of the aforesaid charges against his friend and fellow citizen C. D. accusee as aforesaid, then the said A. B. shall be saved harmless, and remain justified in his procedure. But and if the said A. B. shall fail to make proof as aforesaid, then he, the said A. B. doth, by these presents, submit, admit, and permit that his name, that is to say, the name of him the said A. B. ac∣cuser
<PB N="157" REF="024407_0161_0FC709AD1D31B970"/>
as aforesaid, shall be entered in the book of record of the said honourable court, called the <HI>rascal's record;</HI> there to remain from genera∣tion to generation. World without end. <HI>Amen!</HI></Q></P>
<P>"SIGNED and attested the day and year afore∣said." &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>SUCH, Mr. Printer, are the out lines of my scheme; which I acknowledge may admit of con∣siderable improvement. It would ill become me to expatiate on the many and great advantages that would accrue to my country from such an es∣tablishment. How much bloodshed—how much inkshed, would be spared? How many difficult points of honour, and nice questions of ceremony would be judicially determined? How many pri∣vate animosities would be checked in the first stage, and brought to issue before the blood be∣came heated by argument and altercation? These sources of panegyric I leave to the judicious pens that will doubtless be employed hereafter, if my project should be adopted, in dissertations on the rights, limits, and advantages of <HI>the high court of honour.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot, however, forbear pointing out one benefit that will arise from my project, which is,
<PB N="158" REF="024407_0162_0FC709AE15B60F48"/>
that when a gentleman finds himself so disposed; he may vilify and abuse his friend and neigh∣bour at the very reasonable expence of <HI>two shil∣lings;</HI> whereas it costs the Lord knows what to get a column or two of scandal inserted in your paper: but modesty forbids my saying any thing more on the subject.</P>

<P>☞ JAMES RIVINGTON, printer of the Royal Gazette at New York, whilst the British troops were in possession of that city, had been exceedingly virrulent, abusive, and illiberal in his publications against the Americans, their congress, their army, their officers, and their measures: Every paper abounded with the grossest fal∣sities, misrepresentations, and insults; till at last, facts repeatedly contradicting his positive intelligence, the Royal Gazette lost all credit, even in Europe, where his accounts of the events of the war were chiefly intended to operate. This conduct of Mr. Rivington, and of those who countenanced and assisted him, pro∣voked some sarcasms in return—amongst which were the follow∣ing publications.</P>

<HEAD>A REPLY: IN MR. RIVINGTON's OWN STILE.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To the printer of the Pennsylvania Packet. <SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR paper of the 10th instant, No. 805, reached this city, and an Advertisement therein in∣serted, and signed with my signature, hath attracted universal notice and particular attention, and hath, moreover, rendered me the subject of much saty∣rical stricture.</P>
<P>THE author of this most wicked forgery, who∣ever he is, hath most nefariously, and with ma∣lice aforethought, made use of my name as a ve∣hicle to impose on the judicious public the nuga∣tory productions of his own flimsy brain, as the genuine offspring of my prolific pen. But I do assure you, upon the word of a gentleman, that
<PB N="171" REF="024407_0175_0FC709E1497FD2E0"/>
said advertisement is <HI>in toto</HI> spurious and fictitious. Was the <HI>ultimatum</HI> of the jejune performance nothing more than a little risible satire, I had borne the indignity with taciturn patience: But it is most patent to sense, that an emphatic injury is intended by this attrocious calumniator. The manifest design is to draw upon me the resentment of a people for whom I have the most profound veneration, and whose virtuous and heroic strug∣gles for constitutional liberty I have beheld with a∣stonishment and secret admiration.</P>
<P>YOU may perhaps, Mr Printer, be surprised at this manifesto, and exclaim, that there is no con∣catenation between such a declaration and the uni∣form tenor and tendency of the Royal Gazette of New York. In answer—you are to consider, that it was my lot to remain with a people who had power in their hands, and money in their purses. In such a situation, you must concede, it was the part of a wise man to evade the power, and to possess as much of the money as he could. This I have done: I have written and published for them to the extremest verge of invention—the English language hath been tortured, and truth expired on the rack, in their behalf. By this I have gained their confidence and blinded the Ar∣gus eyes of power—As to money, let the salary I
<PB N="172" REF="024407_0176_0FC709E2634DC010"/>
enjoy, and the baubles I have sold at extortionate prices, evince that my labour hath not been in vain. Have I done this to the injury of A∣merica and advantage of her enemies?—by no means—By overacting my part, I defeated the very purposes I seemed to intend: and the poli∣tical lies I daily fabricated, only served to gull for a time, the fools who thought I was ex∣erting myself in their service; till, by repeat∣ed confutations they lost all credit, even in the cities of New York and London—In the mean time my hopes were rivetted to an event which I foresaw must sooner or later take effect; and I felicitate myself in the prospect of spending in America, amongst heroes and patriots, the cash which I have seduced from the unbuttoned pock∣ets of cockaded coxcombs—in America, the land of liberty, when the storm of war shall cease, and every man may enjoy the fruits of his inge∣nuity under his own vine and his own fig-tree.</P>
<P>I am well aware, Mr Printer, that the voice of your multitude is against me. They judge from appearances only, and appearances are gene∣rally delusive—They suppose that I am the sole author of the inveterate falsehoods, gross mis∣representations, and stigmatic appellations which I so frequently publish against them and their cause
<PB N="173" REF="024407_0177_0FC709E3E32475C0"/>
—Alas! I am but <HI>a poor printer</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His own words.</NOTE>! subjected by my vocation to the execrable task of bringing into the world the monstrous conceptions of weak and disordered minds. But I am deemed a tory—male∣volent tory—and why? truly because I have publi∣shed tory news, tory lies, and tory essays in my ga∣zette. Granted. But will any one pretend to say that I have ever refused to publish whig news, whig lies, or whig essays; I challenge all Philadelphia to produce a single writer who ever sent me a whig piece for publication which I refused or neglected to print— I am confident no such instance can be found.— The truth is, I am a great friend to liberty; and have actually felt the sacred flame glow in my breast—first, about the time, or rather just after the affair of <HI>Saratoga</HI>; and now again on the sur∣render of <HI>Lord Cornwallis</HI> and his army. And if the brave Americans should pursue their suc∣cess, and confirm their independance, of which indeed there now seems to be little doubt, you may depend upon it, there is not a flaming patriot in the Thirteen United Sates that will garrulate the charms of liberty with more loquacious zeal than myself.</P>
<P>IT is most undubitably the duty of every good citizen to serve his king and country. I am desirous
<PB N="174" REF="024407_0178_0FC709E8AC6E5BF0"/>
to fulfil this duty to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oint of punctuality. I have already served my king—my sovereign GEORGE III.—God bless him! to the best of my poor abilities; and now I am ready to wheel to the right-about and serve my country; for I call this my country, wherein I have partook of the viands of luxury, and risen to a height of opulent importance, which I had no hopes of attaining in England, that land of debts, creditors, and into∣lerable oppression.</P>
<P>FINALLY, Mr. Printer, I rest the evidence of my whiggism on two immoveable pillars. First, the declaration I <HI>voluntarily</HI> signed, and which was published in the newspapers of the year 1776: wherein I solemnly asserted my attachment to the American cause, and engaged my sacred honour that I would do nothing inimical thereto:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The mob had taken him in hand in 1776, and to pacify them he published such a declaration.</NOTE> and, secondly, my address to congress lately forwarded by Mr. <HI>John Moody;</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">A spy sent from New-York; detected, and hanged at Philadel∣phia.</NOTE> a copy of which I subjoin, for your satisfaction.</P>

<HEADNOTE>
<P>☞ CONGRESS had, from some disgust, suddenly removed from Philadelphia to Princetown in New-Jersey: but, finding themselves but ill accommodated there, they took into consideration the fixing upon some suitable place for their permanent residence In canvassing this question, the eastern and southern delegates could not agree on a situation equally convenient for both. On motion of Mr. G— it was at length determined, that congress should have two places of alternate residence: one on the banks of the Potowmack, and the o∣ther on the banks of the Delaware: and it was resolved, that congress should not remain less than six months, nor more than two years at either of these places at one time. But as there was no town on the Potowmack fit for their reception, they, for the present, adjourned to Annapolis. This circumstance gave occasion for the following publi∣cation.</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<HEAD>INTELLIGENCE EXTRAORDINARY.</HEAD>
<P>THE great revolution that hath taken place in America, will undoubtedly involve many circum∣stances of considerable importance and curious spe∣culation. None, perhaps, more remarkable than this, that the philosophical world may expect to be entertained with a phenomenon in mechanics, alto∣gether new, and which cannot fail to engage uni∣versal attention.</P>
<P>THE Americans having observed the great irre∣gularities to which the political systems of Europe
<PB N="179" REF="024407_0183_0FC709FC2C153B88"/>
are liable, have invented a method of regulating the affairs of their empire by ACTUAL MECHANISM. For this purpose an immense pendulum hath been constructed, of which the point of suspension is fixed somewhere in the orbit of the planet <HI>Mars,</HI> and the <HI>Bob</HI> is composed of certain heterogeneous matter of great specific gravity, called the <HI>Ameri∣can Congress.</HI></P>
<P>THIS miraculous pendulum is to vibrate between Annapolis, on the Chesapeak, and Trenton, on the Delaware; a range of about 180 miles.</P>
<P>IT will require the most subtle mathematical in∣vestigations to ascertain the true path of this poli∣tical bob: for it is pretty certain that it will not move in a <HI>straight line,</HI> nor in a cycloid, nor in a parabola, nor in an hyperbola, nor in any other known curve; but will have a motion peculiar to itself, forming a <HI>crooked line,</HI> the properties of which cannot be reduced to any of the rules with∣in the present system of mathematics.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH the oscillations of this pendulum will not be performed in, yet they will average equal times. Two vibrations must be made in two years: but these vibrations may bear no determatine proportion to each other; for their relative propor∣tions
<PB N="180" REF="024407_0184_0FC70A00C419BE60"/>
will depend entirely upon the specific gravity of the bob: which being, from the nature of its composition, very variable, will render the oscil∣lations equally variable with respect to each other: and, which is very extraordinary, al∣though in all other instances, the more ponderous a body is, the more it is disposed to rest, and the shorter and slower will its vibrations be when suspended, it will be the reverse in the present case; for the bob will be inclined to moti∣on more or less, in proportion as the matter of which it may be composed shall happen to be more or less dull and heavy.</P>
<P>BY the oscillations of this pendulum and its <HI>hea∣vy</HI> bob, are thirteen wheels of the American ma∣chine to be regulated. And, it is expected, that the different combinations of motions, the actings, and counter-actings, the checks, and counter-checks of the moving parts, will so correct and ballance each other, as to produce, in the final result, a movement so perfectly equable, that the great <HI>desiderata,</HI> viz. the perpetual motion, and the discovery of longitude, will no longer puzzle the brains and drain the purses of seekers in science.</P>
<P>BUT the most entertaining consequence of this improvement in politics will be, that it will render
<PB N="181" REF="024407_0185_0FC70A01EA4FF860"/>
visible the locomotive faculties of the several na∣tions in Europe; so far at least as the same may be ascertained by their respective ambassadors and envoys. For, as they must all follow the move∣ments of the American bob, they will do this ac∣cording to the genius of the countries to which they respectively belong. The volatile and active will always keep within reach of the object of pur∣suit: the careless and indolent will loiter by the way; and the dull and phlegmatic be so distanced, that by the time they shall have arrived at one of the limits of oscillation, they will find it necessary to tack about and follow the pendulum in its return to the other.</P>
<P>IN order to render this alternate peregrination as convenient as may be to their ministers, the se∣veral governments of Europe are to raise by con∣tribution the sum of four hundred thousand guineas for the purpose of levelling the roads between Annapolis and Trenton, building bridges, and erecting houses of residence in each of those towns, if those can properly be called houses of residence wherein the inhabitants are to have no rest.</P>
<P>SOME have thought that when this <HI>monstrous</HI> pendulum shall be once set in motion, it will not be possible to confine it within the proposed limits;
<PB N="182" REF="024407_0186_0FC70A0362E3BF58"/>
but that it will by its great weight (contrary to the usual laws of gravitation) enlarge its field of action, and acquire a velocity which will cause it to swing from New-Hampshire to Georgia.</P>
<P>A further improvement hath also been suggest∣ed; which is this—Many philosophers have been of opinion, that the most regular and proper mo∣tion of a pendulum would be to cause it to swing in a horizontal circle, and not in a vertical plane, as the common practice is, so that the string or rod may describe a cone, of which the apex will be in the point of suspension, and the base formed by the circumference of the circular plane in which the bob moves.</P>
<P>SHOULD this idea prove just (which Mr. Rit∣tenhouse has been directed to ascertain) the revo∣lutions of America will be performed in a circle, whose diameter, north and south, will be from a point in St. John's river, Nova-Scotia, to the mouth of the great river Missisippi, and west and east, from the Lake in the Woods, to an unknown distance in the Atlantic ocean. The only incon∣venience will be the cutting a circular road through mountains and forests for the accommo∣dation of foreign ministers and the officers of
<PB N="183" REF="024407_0187_0FC70A0A289CB2B0"/>
congress; and the providing sufficient ships at the point where the the said line of circumvolution shall leave the continent, and enter on the waters of the Atlantic, in order that their excellencies, and their honours, may be attendant on this sub∣lunary planet in every part of its orbit.</P>

<HEAD>A SUMMARY OF SOME LATE PROCEEDINGS IN A CERTAIN GREAT ASSEMBLY.</HEAD>
<P>—A Member, in the course of debate, took oc∣casion to mention the resolve respecting the alter∣nate residence of the house in two federal cities, and two hundred miles distant from each other; and although he acknowledged himself out of or∣der, as the resolve had already been debated, and the votes thereupon taken; yet he begged leave to draw their attention to a circumstance which had probably escaped notice at the time, which was this: that the house had, some months be∣fore, solemnly resolved, that a certain equestrian statue should be erected in the place where the house should fix its permanent residence. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Congress had before resolved that an equestrian statue, in ho∣nour of General Washington, should be erected in the place where their residence should be fixed.</NOTE> And he requested to know in what manner the House proposed to execute this determination under the
<PB N="185" REF="024407_0189_0FC70A11DDD5FC38"/>
present system of a <HI>peregrinating</HI> instead of a <HI>per∣manent</HI> residence.</P>
<P>THIS struck the house with great force, and many looked upon it as an invincible difficulty; thinking that the two resolves were altogether ir∣reconcileable with each other. But the ingeni∣ous member, who had planned the scheme of the two federal towns, soon relieved them from their embarrassment by declaring—That he had been well aware of this objection, and looked for it at the time the resolve in question was under de∣bate, when indeed he should not have been so ready to answer as at present: That he was now prepared to obviate the objection that had been started, and should in a day or two propose his scheme at large, as he only waited for certain drawings to be completed, which were already in great forwardness.</P>
<P>THE attention of the house being strongly drawn to the subject of this promise, he was earnestly requested to give <HI>Instanter,</HI> some idea of his design.</P>
<P>THE ingenious member, thus urged, said that he was sensible his scheme must greatly suffer in opinion by being exhibited in a partial, imperfect
<PB N="186" REF="024407_0190_0FC70A134F30C370"/>
manner. Nevertheless he could not refuse to gra∣tify the impatience of the house, trusting in their candour that they would not form too hasty a judgment of his design, but wait till they should see the drawings, which would elucidate the whole.</P>
<P>HIS design, he said, was this—not only to com∣ply with the resolve respecting the equestrian statue, but to make that very resolve condu∣cive to the scheme of the two federal towns. The spirit and intention of the resolve respecting the equestrian statue, he observed, was no more than this, that the said statue should always be where the house should sit. To effect which, nothing more was necessary than to adjourn the statue when∣ever and wherever they should adjourn the house, which might easily be done by mounting it on wheels. But this was not all; for if the horse should be constructed of a suitable size, and fra∣med with timbers, like the hull of a ship, it might be made a most convenient vehicle to transport the members themselves, with their books, papers, &amp;c. from one federal town to the other: and added, that the drawings he had mentioned were designed to exhibit such a construction of the body of a horse, as might most conveniently answer this purpose: whereby would be shown the seats intend∣ed for the respective members, the places for the
<PB N="187" REF="024407_0191_0FC70A1981E7DAA0"/>
president and secretary, and a little closet in the <HI>intestinum rectum,</HI> for the secret papers of the house: provision being also made for light and air, and every other convenience suitable to so great a design.</P>
<P>HE confessed he had taken his idea from the fa∣mous <HI>Grecian horse,</HI> used at the siege of <HI>Troy;</HI> and had been searching <HI>Homer</HI> with all his commen∣tators, annotators, and translators, in hopes of finding some description of the internal construc∣tion of that memorable machine; but receiving no assistance from these sources, he had been ob∣liged to depend upon his own ingenuity, and the advice of an able ship-wright, who was now ma∣king the drawings he proposed to lay before the house.</P>
<P>THIS device of the <HI>ingenious</HI> member was recei∣ved with great applause—but a <HI>still more ingenious</HI> member rose up, and said—that the gentleman who spoke last, had in some measure anticipated a project he had conceived, and was preparing to offer. But as the design he had formed was upon a much larger scale than that which had been suggested, he should not with-hold it from the house, although he confessed it was planned on much the same principles.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="024407_0192_0FC70A1AB336FA28"/>THE difficulty respecting the statue, he said, had not indeed occured to him; but one of at least equal importance had—which was the enor∣mous expence of building two federal towns, when one might be sufficient for all purposes.</P>
<P>TO obviate this, he would propose that there should be <HI>two</HI> places of <HI>alternate, permanent</HI> resi∣dence, agreeably to the late resolve, and but <HI>one</HI> federal town; which town should be built upon a large platform, mounted on a great number of wheels, and be drawn by a great number of horses.</P>
<P>THIS, he observed, would be productive of many great conveniences. It would render the immence expence of building two federal towns unnecessary—It would spare the trouble and con∣fusion of packing and unpacking, deranging and arranging their books and papers at every ad∣journment—and it would save much precious time, inasmuch as there would be no inter∣ruption in their proceedings; for the business of the house might be going on, whilst the house itself <HI>was going on</HI>; and motions not only be made in the house, but the house itself <HI>make motions</HI> —so that, with the motions of the members, the motions of the house, and the motions of the
<PB N="189" REF="024407_0193_0FC70A1C26C717F0"/>
whole federal town, all the powers of govern∣ment would be in constant action for the good of the empire.</P>
<P>HE then proceeded to show that such a scheme was neither absurd in itself, nor impracticable in in fact. It was not absurd, he said, because nature, who does nothing improper, had furnished many instances of the kind—as in the snail, the tortoise, and several other animals—neither was it imprac∣tible, as he could fully prove. He asserted that he had himself seen in England an ingenious tin∣ker, who had mounted a small house upon wheels, which contained a bed, some necessary furniture, and the utensils of his trade, and was drawn about by a single horse: so that, when he had exhausted the custom of one village, he removed, <HI>cum omni∣bus appurtenantibus,</HI> to another; and by that means secured a constant circulation of employ.</P>
<P>BUT I have an instance, said he, more directly in point—I mean that of the empress of Russia; who, when she removes her court from Peters∣burgh to Moscow, is accommodated with ele∣gant apartments, built on sleds, and drawn by fifty horses, over a tract of snow many hundred miles in extent.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="024407_0194_0FC70A1DB6295370"/>BUT it may be objected, continued this more in∣genious member, that these are only examples of a single room, or two or three apartments being ren∣dered moveable by machinery; but to make a whole town—a federal town—an imperial city— thus transitory, must be totally impracticable, un∣less by the help of art magic—I am not unpre∣pared, said he, to answer this objection. It is cer∣tainly a mark of great weakness to conclude eve∣ry principle false of which we cannot conceive, and every purpose impossible, which we know not how to effect. A fool often wonders improper∣ly. He sees a jack-weight descend without sur∣prise, but exclaims with admiration at the move∣ments of an orrery: whereas, in truth, there is in∣finitely more mystery in the descent of a jack-weight than in the most complicated movements of an orrery.</P>
<P>I shall not now undertake to describe minutely the means by which our federal town may be ren∣dered <HI>itinerant.</HI> This I reserve for a future day; but to shew that the thing is at least not impossible, I beg leave to read a passage from a book I have in my hand. It is entitled, <HI>A Voyage to the Moon, by Cerano de Bergerac,</HI> p. 112 &amp; 114. <Q>At this our young host enquired from his father, What
<PB N="191" REF="024407_0195_0FC70A29A5B7DE58"/>
was the hour? Who replying it had already struck eight, he very angrily asked him, how he dared to neglect calling him at seven, as he had ordered; when he knew very well the houses were to begin their journey next day, the walls of the town being already gone? The good man told him, that since his sitting down at table, a proclamation had been made, for∣bidding the houses to set out before the day af∣ter to-morrow.</Q></P>
<P><Q>IN order to turn the discourse, I intreated him to inform me, what was meant by the re∣moval of the town, and if the houses and walls really travelled? Dear stranger, said he, our buildings are of two sorts, the <HI>moveable</HI> and the <HI>sedentary.</HI> The <HI>moveable,</HI> in one of which you are now, I am about to describe. They are composed, as you see, of very light wood: and at the building of them, the architect places four strong wheels under the foundations of the walls. Six large pair of bellows are placed, with their noses horizontal to the wings of the up∣per story; so that when a town is to be re∣moved (which is always done as the seasons change) several large s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ils are unfolded before the nose of these bellows, which being set at
<PB N="192" REF="024407_0196_0FC70A2B22DD79E0"/>
work, discharge the wind so very forcibly upon them, that the houses are set in motion, and by the violence of the gust which drives them for∣ward, are enabled to travel upwards of an hun∣dred leagues in eight days.</Q></P>
<P>THE <HI>very ingenious</HI> member quoted this autho∣rity with no small marks of triumph, and observed, in closing the book, that what had been done might be done again. That he should, however, improve upon this device of his lunatic brethren, by causing his town to move bodily, with all its rights, privileges, and appurtenances, and not by single houses, which he apprehended would be apt to occasion much confusion on the road.</P>
<P>HE concluded, with saying, that the only thing he should ask of the house would be to proclaim a two days fast previous to every ad∣journment; not only with a view to render the burden of so vast a machine as light as possible, but also to avoid too great a complexity of <HI>motions</HI> during the journey.</P>
<P>THE house was astonished at the extensive ge∣nius of the projecting member; and immediately
<PB N="193" REF="024407_0197_0FC70A2CA4101610"/>
adjourned; having first recommended it to each other to consider against the next meeting, if any objections could possibly to be made to the last proposed scheme.</P>

<HEADNOTE>
<P>☞ MR. OSWALD, the printer of the <HI>Independent Gazeteer,</HI> having published some free strictures on the conduct of the supreme court, the judges ordered him to be indicted for a libel. The grand jury, after a full enquiry, returned the bill <HI>ignoramus.</HI> The judges, enraged at this refusal, attempted to overawe them by se∣vere reproofs in open court, and sent them back for reconsideration: but the jury adhered to their verdict; and justified themselves in a public address in the papers. Some essays on the subject of grand juries appeared in answer, generally believed to be written by the judges themselves,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Chief Justice M'Kean and Judge Bryan.</HI></NOTE> under the signatures of JURISPERITUS and ADRIAN. And these occasioned the following observations in return.</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<HEAD>FOR THE PENNSYLVANIA PACKET.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>January 1783.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>FROM what hath appeared in the public papers respecting the late contest between the judges of the court of oyer and terminer, and the grand jury for the city and county of Philadelphia, this sub∣ject hath claimed the general attention of the coun∣try, and the rights and duties of juries have been dis∣cussed in almost every company—ignorantly enough no doubt. But the people, ever jealous of their liber∣ties,
<PB N="195" REF="024407_0199_0FC7056F210892D0"/>
are ready to take alarm on any appearance of danger, without regarding the quarter from whence the invasion arises, or the motives that induced it: the robes of office are not long enough to screen the invader from censure, nor the seemingly harmless motive of pride palliate the offence. Are our li∣berties safe or are they not? is the only question with the people at large. Friends may explain, and sycophants may flatter, but strict right knows neither friends nor flatterers.</P>
<P>FOR my own part, I confess I am no lawyer; and wonder how it should come to pass that I should appear in the Pennsylvania Packet on a law subject—but the thing is unavoidable—as I feel myself urged by what I conceive to be a sense of duty.</P>
<P>I had, some how or other, acquired a notion that there were but two screens between the sub∣ject and the rigour of the law. I mean the grand jury, and the power of pardon, lodged some∣where in every system of government. The first, as a security to the innocent accused, that he may not be brought to a disgraceful, vexatious, and ex∣pensive trial; and the other, a merciful interference to relax the rigid cords of conviction, in cases where, though the crime may have been sufficient∣ly
<PB N="196" REF="024407_0200_0FC705773B7ADE20"/>
ascertained, yet concomitant circumstances may justify an extension of pardon.</P>
<P>I imagined that the grand inquest of the county, when duly returned, composed a body of trust and power inferior to none but the legislature itself. That they are constitutionally independent of every influence and controul in the line of their office, and not accountable for their decisions, unless in cases of manifest corruption and breach of the laws. That they are superior to and not the servants of the court, in as much as the court with all its powers cannot proceed against a citizen, or any individual in the criminal line, without the sanc∣tion and consent of this grand inquest (except in cases of attainder or contempts in the face of the court). For, as to the doctrine of proceeding by information, I do not fully understand it; yet know enough to hope it, will never gain an esta∣blishment in this country.</P>
<P>I thought the power of a grand jury, indepen∣dent as it is, could never give any just cause of jealousy; because it is lodged in a kind of repre∣sentation of the people of the county, if the she∣riff does his duty with integrity and discretion—in a number of men hastily drawn together, between whom there could not have existed any previous
<PB N="197" REF="024407_0201_0FC705783142B3D8"/>
collective connection, and, therefore, no danger of collusion; and particularly because their office and power are so temporary that there is not time to form any systematical abuses of either</P>
<P>I had further conceived, that as the grand jury were impannelled merely for the purpose of pro∣tecting the innocent, by bringing the guilty, and none but the guilty, to an open trial, they must of course have a right <HI>to make a strict enquiry,</HI> ac∣cording to the tenor of their official oath—that is, to command to be brought before them all manner of legal testimony, of what nature soever, that may in any wise tend to the discovery of truth, and of the whole truth; and that they may and ought to do this of right, uninfluenced, and unau∣thorised by any interfering power. Because, if the grand jury were prohibited from all testimony but such as the court should furnish, and <HI>obliged</HI> to receive as authentic, nothing but the dictates of the judges or the attorney general (who in truth ought to be no more than assistants and advisers of the grand jury in matters of form only), they would be an unnecessary wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el in the political machine, and serve no purpo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> but that of giving a legal sanction to the will of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he court.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="024407_0202_0FC70579A1A860F8"/>THESE, and some other extravagant notions, found myself possessed of whenever I conversed on the subject, but could not recollect the source from whence I had drawn my ideas.</P>
<P>AT length I saw a piece in the <HI>Freeman's Journal</HI> of the 15th instant, signed ADRIAN; and was horribly shocked to find sentiments and doc∣trines advanced on this subject so very contrary to those which I had entertained. As I doubt not but this performance must have been written by a very great man, from the elegance of the stile, and by a very great lawyer, from the subtlety of the rea∣soning, I began to fear that I was all in the wrong. I thought of it night and day, till at last I disco∣vered tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the store from which I had taken all my prejudices was close at my elbow. You must know that we have in the house an old folio book which my grandfather had brought with him from Eng∣land. My father had made no other use of it but to strap his razor on the leathern cover thereof when he had occasion to shave himself; and as it concerned the politics of a distant country one hundred years ago, and as our family were no po∣liticians, it had lain for a long time neglected on the upper shelf of a closet. I recollected, how∣ever, that about twelve or fourteen years ago, I had in some idle hour, taken up this book, and read
<PB N="199" REF="024407_0203_0FC7057FAF13F4C8"/>
with some attention a piece therein respecting the rights and powers of a grand jury.</P>
<P>I hope our new pope is not as infallible as his predecessor of the same name: if he is, my au∣thor, and consequently myself, must be greatly mis∣taken. I shall not pretend to say which is most to be depended upon; but as the doctrine respects a very important right of the people, I shall con∣trast the two authors, and leave the decision to abler judges.</P>
<P>THE book to which I refer is entitled
<Q><HI>STATE TRACTS,</HI> being a collection of several choice trea∣tises relating to government from the year <HI>1660</HI> to <HI>1689.</HI></Q>
And the treatise which had engaged my particular attention is entitled
<Q>The security of Englishmen's lives; or the trust, power, and duty of the grand juries of England; <HI>explained</HI> according to the fundamentals of the English go∣vernment, and the declaration of the same made in parliament by many statutes.</Q></P>
<P>IN the preface to this book we are told—<Q>This is a collection that will in general set forth the true and legal constitution of our ancient famous English government—In particular, here will be seen the trust, power, and duty of grand
<PB N="200" REF="024407_0204_0FC7058161650AB0"/>
juries, and the great security of Englishmens lives in their faithful discharge thereof.</Q></P>
<P>WITH respect to <HI>Adrian's</HI> performance, I am willing to suppose that his narrative of the case in question may be true, not having had an opportu∣nity of informing myself more certainly. All that I know of the matter is that a writer in Mr Oswald's paper had presumed to censure the conduct of the chief justice in two instances: for which offence two indictments had been sent to the grand jury against Mr Oswald as a publisher of libels. Had the testimony been sufficient to support these in∣dictments: had the jury returned them <HI>true bills,</HI> and had a conviction ensued, the consequence would have been, at least this—that one citizen having offended another, would have been thrown into the power of the offended party to be puni∣shed according to that measure of resentment which his wounded pride might instigate</P>
<P><HI>ADRIAN</HI> is pleased to say—"For these <HI>false</HI> and scandalous libels on the court and the justice of the country, which ought not only to be above impu∣tation but free of suspicion, Mr Oswald was arre∣sted."—These libels, says <HI>Adrian,</HI> were <HI>false</HI>; but nineteen honest and impartial men, declare, upon
<PB N="201" REF="024407_0205_0FC7058424873240"/>
oath, that they were not false<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Oswald's publication consisted merely of a narrative of the con∣duct of the court in a particular case: the jury on enquiry, found that the narrative was strictly true, and therefore could not find the bill.</NOTE>—and not only upon oath, but according to <HI>Adrian's</HI> own asserti∣on,
<Q>after keeping the bill two days, and hear∣ing divers testimonies.</Q>
It appears then that the grand jury did deliberately, and not hastily, or unwarily, reject those bills.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the oath of secrecy ta∣ken by the grand jury, <HI>Adrian</HI> thinks he has fished out the reasons by which they were gover∣ne'd—<Q>It is said, (says he,) that upon examining several other persons it was made out, <HI>some how,</HI> that the printer had been misinformed: thence it was inferred, that mistake merely involved no guilt.</Q></P>
<P><HI>ADRIAN</HI> had just before observed,that the jus∣tice of the country should not only be above im∣putation but free of suspicion. Now, I am inclined to think, that the grand jury, for the time, more nearly represents the justice of the country than even the learned judges themselves: and yet <HI>Adrian</HI> suspects that they made out testimony <HI>some how or other</HI>—an insinuation at least that they had
<PB N="202" REF="024407_0206_0FC7058E580A7AE0"/>
acted unfairly—whether they did so or not, I leave to themselves to answer—I am not their champion in this particular instance—I contend only for ge∣neral principles; and shall proceed to select from <HI>Adrian's</HI> performance some doctrinal passages, which seem to be inconsistent with the tenor of my old book.</P>
<P><Q>WAS there not, (says he,) the usual probable evidence for an open enquiry by a petit jury? If there was, why stifle the cause in the chamber of the grand inquest?</Q>
<HI>Probable evidence,</HI> and <HI>stifle a cause</HI>—horrid language! are men's lives, repu∣tations, and fortunes to be hung upon the tenter-hooks of logical probabilities: and is the fair ac∣quittal of a fellow-citizen from a heinous charge to be called a stifled cause?—Oh, sovereign pontiff, have mercy upon us!
<Q>Upon this, the chief-ju∣stice seemingly provoked at their irregularities (I hope it was in appearance only) asked the grounds on which the grand jury had proceeded, and how they came to receive witnesses not admitted by the court?</Q>
This, dilated into plain language, will stand thus:—Gentlemen, you are enjoined by your oath of office, diligently to enquire, and pre∣sentment make, of the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. But, remember you are to shut your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ars against all testimony but such as
<PB N="203" REF="024407_0207_0FC705902588A868"/>
I shall send you, otherwise you may perhaps find this fellow innocent of the charge, when it is my desire that he should be punished.</P>
<P><Q>THEY declined (or one for the rest did so) giving any reasons for their conduct, under pretence that they were sworn not to reveal the secrets of the state, or their fellows; as if this oath restrained them.</Q>
<HI>Adrian</HI> then promises, that he will hereafter shew the public—<Q>the true nature and constitution of a <HI>grand jury,</HI> that part of legal machinery, composed of unlearned men, (to use the phraseology of the profession,) which is regulated and controlled by the law, as other juries, at every step, and in every in∣stance of their trust, and submitted to the legal direction of the court.</Q>
Observe, reader, how irreverently his holiness speaks of one of the most respectable bodies in our government—little reve∣rence, indeed, would be due, if they were no other than what he represents them to be: I wish to know what trust can be said to be committed to a body of men who are to be regulated and controll∣ed at every step and in every instance? But let us contrast these modern doctrines, and this <HI>Adri∣anatic</HI> idea of a grand jury with select passages from an author of the last century.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="024407_0208_0FC70591ACFD0378"/>HE first speaks of the laws and government of England, in general, and gives the construction of grand and petit juries, but says—<Q>It is not de∣signed at this time to undertake a discourse of of petit juries: but to consider the nature and power of grand inquests: and to shew how much the reputation, the fortunes, and the lives of Englishmen depend on the conscientious per∣formance of their duty.</Q></P>
<P><Q>IT was absolutely necessary for the support of government, that some should be entrusted to en∣quire after all such, as by treasons, felonies, or les∣ser crimes, disturbed the peace, that they might be prosecuted and brought to condign punish∣ment; and it was no less needful for every man's quiet and safety, that the trust of such inquisitions should be put into the hands of persons of under∣standing and integrity, indifferent and impartial: that might suffer no man to be falsely accused or defamed, nor the lives of any to be put in jeopar∣dy, by the malicious conspiracies of great or small; or the perjuries of any profligate wretch∣es. For these necessary honest ends was the institution of grand-juries.</Q></P>
<P><Q>OUR ancestors thought it not best to trust this great concern of their lives and interests in
<PB N="205" REF="024407_0209_0FC705933637EDB8"/>
the hands of any officer of the king's▪ or in any judges named by him, or in any certain number of men during life, lest they should be awed or influenced by great men, corrupted by bribes, flatteries, or love of power, or become negligent, or partial to friends and relations, or pursue their own quarrels, or private revenges, or connive at conspiracies of others, and indict thereupon.</Q></P>
<P>HE then goes on to shew what sort of men a grand jury ought to be composed of, and in what character the law considers them, viz.—Men
<Q>most honest and most sufficient for knowledge and abi∣lity of mind and estate.</Q>
—And not, according to the phraseology of ADRIAN, <HI>a legal machine, composed of unlearned men.</HI></P>
<P>—<Q>I knew too well, says my author, that the wisdom and care of our ancestors in this in∣stitution of grand juries, hath not been of late considered as it ought, nor the laws concerning them duly observed, nor have the gentlemen, nor other men of estates in the several counties, dis∣cerned how insensibly their legal power and ju∣risdiction in their grand and petit juries is decay∣ed, and much of the means to preserve their own lives and interests taken out of their hands. 'Tis a wonder they were not more awakened
<PB N="206" REF="024407_0210_0FC7059B1D6CC2B8"/>
with the attempts of the late lord chief justice K—, who would have usurped a lordly dicta∣torial power over the grand jury of Somerset∣shire, and commanded them to find a bill of in∣dictment for murder, for which they saw no evi∣dence; and upon their refusal, he not only threat∣ened the jury, but assumed to himself an arbitra∣ry power to fine them. Here was a bold battery made upon the ancient fence of our reputations and lives. If that justice's will had passed for law, all the gentlemen of the grand jury must have been the basest vassals to the judges, and have been penally obliged <HI>jurare in verbo magistri,</HI> to have sworn to the directions or dictates of the judges. But, thanks be to God! the late long parliament (though filled with pensioners) could not bear such a bold invasion of the English li∣berties; but upon the complaint of one sir Hugh Windham, foreman of the said jury, and a mem∣ber of that parliament, the commons brought the then chief justice to the bar to acknowledge his fault, whereupon the prosecution ceased.</Q></P>
<P><Q>GRAND juries are our only security, inasmuch as our lives cannot be drawn into jeopardy by all the malicious crafts of the devil, unless such a number of our honest countrymen shall be satis∣fied in the truth of the accusation.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="024407_0211_0FC7059CEBCF2DF0"/>
<Q><HI>THEREFORE every grand juryman is sworn as the foreman, in the words following, viz.</HI> You shall diligently enquire, and true presentment make of all such articles, matters, and things, as shall be given you in charge; and of all other matters and things as shall come to your own knowledge, touching the present service: the (king's) counsel, your fellows, and your own, you shall keep secret: you shall present no man for hatred or malice, nei∣ther shall you leave any one unpresented for favour or affection, for love or gain, or any hopes thereof; but in all things you shall present the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, to the best of your knowledge: <HI>SO HELP YOU GOD!</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>HENCE it evidently appears, that every grand jury is bound to enquire diligently after the truth of every thing for which they shall indict or present a man.—When a grand jury is sworn to enquire diligently, it is natural and necessary to their business to think of whom they should enquire; and it is plainly and easily resolved that they ought to enquire of every man that can or will inform them.—It seems, therefore, from the words of the oath, that there is no bound or limit set (save their own understanding or conscience) to any number or sort of persons of whom they are bound to enquire. They ought
<PB N="208" REF="024407_0212_0FC705A7B52B34C0"/>
first and principally to enquire of one another, mutually what knowledge each of them hath of the matter in question before them. The law presumes that some at least of so many sufficient men of the county must know or have heard of all notable things done against the public peace. —If the parties, and the facts whereof they are accused, be known to the jury or any of them, their own knowledge will supply the room of many witnesses. Next, they ought to enquire of all such witnesses as the prosecutors will pro∣duce against the accused. They are bound to examine all fully and prudently, to the best of their skill. Every juryman ought to ask such questions (by the foreman at least) as he thinks necessary to resolve any doubt that may arise in him, either about the fact, or witnesses, or other∣wise, if the jury be then doubtful, they ought to receive all such further testimony as shall be of∣fered them, and to send for such as any of them do think able to give testimony in the case de∣pending.</Q></P>
<P><Q>NO directions can legally be imposed upon them by any court or judges. An honest jury will thankfully accept good advice from judges, as they are assistants; but they are bound by their oaths to present the truth, the whole truth,
<PB N="209" REF="024407_0213_0FC705AB1D0BDE08"/>
and nothing but the truth, to the best of their own, not the judge's, knowledge; neither can they, without a breach of that oath, resign their consciences, or blindly submit to the dictates of others; and therefore, ought to receive or reject such advices, as they judge them good or bad.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE language wherein the oath is penned, is known and understood by every man, and the words in it have the same signification as they have wheresoever they are used. The judges (without assuming to themselves a legislative power) cannot put a new sense upon them, other than according to their genuine common mean∣ing. They cannot magisterially impose their opinions upon the jury, and make them forsake the direct words of their oath to pursue their glosses. They are carefully to examine what sort of men the witnesses are.—It is undoubtedly law which we find reported in <HI>Stiles,</HI> that though there be witnesses to prove the bill, yet the grand inquest is not bound to find it if they see cause to the contrary.</Q>
—<HI>St. Rep.</HI> 11.</P>
<P>MY author then considers the nature and intent of the secrecy imposed on the grand jury by their oath; which is chiefly to prevent combinations of
<PB N="210" REF="024407_0214_0FC705ABE6BCE690"/>
witnesses, escapes of the guilty, and conspiracies a∣gainst the accused: and then says,</P>
<P><Q>IF it should be said, that whatsoever reasons there are for this oath of secrecy, yet it cannot deprive the king of the benefit of having the evi∣dence made public, if he desires it, and that the grand jury do not break their oaths when the king, or the prosecutor for him, will have it so, 'tis not hard to shew that such notions have no foundation in law or reason, and seem to come from men who have not well studied the first principles of the English government.</Q></P>
<P><Q>IT ought to be taken for a scandal upon the king, when he is represented in a court of justice, as if he were partially concerned; or rather in∣clined to desire, that a party accused should be found guilty, than that he should be declared innocent, if he be so in truth.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Adrian says, why stifle a cause in the chamber of the grand inquest?</NOTE> Queen Eliza∣beth had a true sense of our law, when the lord Burleigh, upon sir Edward Coke, her then at∣torney, coming into her presence, told her, this is he who prosecutes <HI>pro domina regina: for our lady the queen;</HI> and she said she would have the
<PB N="211" REF="024407_0215_0FC705AD66F44A40"/>
form of the record altered, for it should be <HI>attor∣natus-generalis qui pro domina veritate sequitur: the attorney-general who prosecutes for our lady the truth.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>NOW suppose a man perfectly innocent and in some measure knowing in the law, should be ac∣cused of treason or felony: if the judges should deny unto the grand jury the liberty of examin∣ing any witnesses except in open court, where no∣thing shall be offered that may help to clear the prisoner, but every thing aggravated that gives colour for the accusation; such persons only pro∣duced as the king's counsel or the prosecutor shall think fit to call: how can innocence secure any man from being arraigned?</Q></P>
<P><Q>FEW men at first see the danger of little chan∣ges in fundamentals; and those who design them usually act with such craft, as, besides giving spe∣cious reasons, they take great care that the true reason shall not appear. Every design, there∣fore, of changing the constitution, ought to be most warily observed, and strictly opposed.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THERE are two vulgar errors concerning the duty of grand juries, which, if not removed, will in time destroy all the benefit we can expect
<PB N="212" REF="024407_0216_0FC705B0035512B8"/>
from that constitution, by turning them into a mere matter of form, which were designed for so great ends. Many have of late thought, and affirmed it for law, that the grand jury is neither to make so strict enquiry into matters before them, nor to look for so clear evidence of the crime as the petit jury; but that their present∣ments being to pass a second examination, they ought to indict upon a superficial enquiry, and bare probabilities. Whereas, should either of these opinions be admitted, the prejudice to the subject would be equal to the total laying aside grand juries. There being in truth, no differ∣ence between arraigning without any present∣ment from them at all, and their presenting upon slight grounds.—For the first, that grand juries ought not to make so strict enquiry: it were to be wished, that we might know how it comes to pass, that an oath should be obligatory unto a petit jury and not unto the grand. The truth is, that grand juries have both a larger field for their enquiry, and are in many respects better capacitated to make a strict one than the petit juries. These last are confined, as to the person and the crime specified in the indictment; but, <HI>they</HI> are at large obliged to search into the whole matter that any way concerns every case before them.—The petit jury are bound to move with∣in
<PB N="213" REF="024407_0217_0FC705B797C1E0F0"/>
the circle of the indictment made by the grand jury.—'Tis true that upon hearing the party or his witnesses, the petit jury may acquit or judge the facts in the indictment to be less heinous or malicious than they were presented by the grand jury, but cannot aggravate them; which being considered, it will easily appear, by the intent and nature of the powers given unto the grand juries, that they are by their oaths obliged to keep all injustice from entering the first gates of courts of judicature, and to secure the innocent not only from punishment, but from all disgrace, vexation, expence or danger.</Q></P>
<P><Q>IT is necessary to know what they mean by a probable cause or evidence, who say that our law requires no more for an indictment. <HI>Proba∣ble</HI> is a logical term, relating to such propositions as have an appearance, but no certainty of truth. These may be allowed in rhetoric, which work∣eth upon the passions: but courts of justice are not erected to bring men into condemnation, but to find who deserves to be condemned; and those rules are to be followed by them, which are least liable to deception. If the word <HI>probable</HI> be taken in a common, rather than a strict logi∣cal sense, it signifies no more than <HI>likely,</HI> or ra∣ther likely than unlikely. When a matter is
<PB N="214" REF="024407_0218_0FC705BA1C4532A8"/>
found to be so, the wager is not even—there is odds upon one side. And this may be very good betting in a Tennis-court or at a horse race; but he that would make the administration of justice to depend upon such points seems to put a very small value upon the fortunes, liberties, and reputations of men; and to forget that those who sit in courts of justice have no other busi∣ness there than to preserve them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>IT hath been said (in a book entitled <HI>the grand juryman's oath and office</HI>) that their work is no more than to present offences fit for trial, and for that reason give in only a verisimilar or probable charge: And others have affirmed that a far less evidence will warrant a grand jury's indictment, than a petit jury's verdict. But nothing can be more opposite to the justice of our laws than such opinions. All laws, in doubtful cases, direct a suspension of judgement, or a sentence, in favour of the accused person: but if this were hearkened to, grand juries should upon their oaths affirm him criminal, when the evidence is upon such uncertain grounds, that they cannot but doubt whether he is so or not.</Q></P>
<P><Q>'TIS scarcely credible that any learned in our laws should tell a grand jury that a far less
<PB N="115" REF="024407_0219_0FC705BAE2BCDE38"/>
evidence will warrant their indictment (being but an accusation) than the petit jury ought to have for their verdict</Q>—<Q>There is no real difference between affirming in writing that an indictment of treason <HI>is true,</HI> as is the practice of grand juries, and saying that the party indic∣ted thereupon <HI>is guilty</HI> of the treason whereof he is indicted, as is the course of petit juries. They are both upon their oaths, which are equally obligatory unto both. The one there∣fore must expect the same proof for their satis∣faction as the other, and as clear evidence must be required for an indictment as for a ver∣dict.</Q></P>
<P>—<Q>WHATEVER ground this doctrine of in∣dicting upon slight proofs may have got in our days, it is (as we have seen) both against law and reason, and contrary to the practice of for∣mer times. My lord Coke, in his comment on Westm. 2d. tells us, that in those days (and as yet it ought to be) indictments taken in the absence of the party, were formed upon plain and direct proofs, and not upon probabilities and inferences. Herein we see that the practice of our forefathers, and the opinion of this great and judicious lawyer, were directly against this new doctrine; and some that have carefully
<PB N="216" REF="024407_0220_0FC705C0615D7548"/>
looked backwards observed that there are very few examples of men acquitted by petit juries, because grand juries of old were so wary in can∣vassing every thing narrowly, and so sensible of duty in proceeding unto truth upon satisfactory evidence, that few or none were brought unto trial till their guilt seemed evident.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THEREFORE let the grand juries faithfully perform their high trust, and neither be cheated nor frighted from their duty. Let them pursue the good old way, since no innovation can be brought in, that will not turn to the prejudice of the ac∣cused person and themselves. Let them not be deluded with frivolous arguments, so as to in∣validate a considerable part of our law, and ren∣der themselves insignificant cyphers, in expec∣tation that petit juries will repair the faults they commit; since that would be no less than to slight one of the best fences that the law provides for our lives and liberties, and very much to weaken the other.</Q></P>
<P>SUCH are the quotations I have thought fit to make from this valuable old book; and wish the whole treatise on this subject were reprinted.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="024407_0221_0FC705C35AA80150"/>I shall be told, I suppose, that this is not law, and is of no authority—Of this I do not pretend to judge—but sure I am that it is reason; and if it is not law, it ought to be. What is generally called law authority is the opinion or decision of some learned judge on the point in question; but it should be observed▪ that grand juries are not like to have any contests, nor have they ever had any that I know of, except with the learned judges themselves: now, if the judge's opinion is to de∣termine the point and become law authority, there can be little doubt but he will do it as much in favour of his own power, and that of his succes∣sors, as possible.</P>
<P>IT does not appear by my old folio book, who was the author of this treatise on grand juries; it contains, however, the sentiments of a freeman one hundred years ago; and hath been deemed so judicious a performance as to gain a place amongst a valuable collection of authentic papers; and to be particularly pointed at and strongly recom∣mended in the preface to this collection.</P>
<P>HOW very different are the opinions and doc∣trines of this writer from those of <HI>Adrian!</HI> He is for giving the accused all possible chance for his vindication, even before he is brought to the test
<PB N="218" REF="024407_0222_0FC705C4C1266B18"/>
of a petit jury—<HI>Adrian</HI> is for giving him no chance at all, in the first instance, but seems to think that nothing less than the absolute impossibility of pro∣curing even probable proof against him should acquit him there, and justice will be done af∣terwards by the petit jury. And that he may be thankful for his final escape, after having been ruined in health, reputation, and estate by con∣finement, infamy, fees and costs—my good old author seems to be of opinion, that it should be a cause of satisfaction and joy when a fellow-citizen is acquitted of a crime laid to his charge; but <HI>Adrian</HI> thinks a man accused, and not hanged, is <HI>a cause stifled.</HI> Lastly, my author esteems the grand inquest for the county as a most respectable body, in which the law hath placed the highest trust and confidence; but our new pope declares that it is no more than <HI>a legal machine,</HI> to be go∣verned and controlled in all its movements by the judges of the court—which of these doctrines is most likely to be founded in truth, to promote the administration of justice, and secure the liberty of the subject, let the public determine.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE PEOPLE.</HEAD>
<P>THE rights and duty of a grand jury and the prerogatives of the bench, are subjects now fairly brought before you: and as they are of high im∣portance to good order in government, on the one hand, and to the security of the lives and liberties of the people, on the other, I hope they will be attended to with the circumspection they deserve.</P>
<P>IT is precisely the time to investigate this sub∣ject. We know not what sort of judges we may have hereafter. Our struggles for liberty are not yet over. Our apprehensions have been roused by the war, and are yet feelingly awake. If under these circumstances you tacitly submit to the doc∣trines lately advanced from the bench of the su∣preme court, and in the publication of <HI>Adrian</HI> and <HI>Jurisperitus,</HI> it will be difficult for a future patriot to encounter so strong a precedent, as he will be told that there was neither corruption, force, or inadvertency in the case; but <HI>the people,</HI> after warning given, voluntarily submitted to and acquiesced in the doctrine.</P>
<P>WHILST our heroic officers and brave citizens
<PB N="220" REF="024407_0224_0FC705CDA4A8A8A8"/>
are in the field fighting for our liberties and de∣fending our rights, let us who remain at home, at least take care of the houshold—Observe the following FABLE.</P>
<P>A CERTAIN man had an undoubted right to a valuable farm. It was his living—it was his all. A powerful lord wished to possess this farm, and sent his servants to take the title deeds by force. The good man locked up his papers in his closet, and arming himself at all points, went forth to combat his adversary: but, alas! whilst he was in the field, the rats were gnawing his deeds in the closet.</P>
<P>THE common people are afraid of the word <HI>law.</HI> They think it is full of inexplicable mys∣tery. It is not so in the text; it is too much so by the exposition. All law is, or ought to be, founded in reason, and hath for its object the administration of general justice or the pro∣motion of general good. Every man of common sense is capable to judge of law, provided all cir∣cumstances and all consequences are made known to him. Let any one be asked, For what purpose do you think grand juries were instituted? He will say, I do not understand the law, but I suppose
<PB N="221" REF="024407_0225_0FC705CF2634F1E0"/>
they must have been instituted to bring the guilty, and none but the guilty, to a further trial by a pe∣tit jury. There is no mystery in this—the greatest lawyer could not give a better answer. Ask this plain man further—Why he thinks so? and he will probably reply—for three reasons: First, be∣cause it is highly necessary that the innocent should have this security against false or malicious prosecutions. Secondly, because a grand jury cannot possibly be of any other use. And, third∣ly, because their oath of office is full to this pur∣pose, and to no other. But stop, my friend, says a learned judge, your first reason is good for no∣thing, your second is no better, and your third is flatly contradicted in 4th Blackstone, page 300. Let us see how this matter stands—a grand-jury-man's path is in these words:</P>
<P><Q>YOU shall diligently enquire, and true present∣ment make, of all such articles, matters, and things as shall be given you in charge: and of all other matters and things as shall come to your own knowledge, touching this present service: the state's council, your fellow's, and your own, you shall keep secret; you shall present no person for hatred or malice, neither shall you leave any one unpresented for favour or affection, for love or gain, or any hopes thereof: but in all things
<PB N="222" REF="024407_0226_0FC705D3CA7886D8"/>
you shall present the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, to the best of your know∣ledge: SO HELP YOU GOD!</Q></P>
<P>THIS is certainly very plain English, and incapa∣ble, one would suppose, of misconstruction. But, let us observe how <HI>Jurisperitus,</HI> with the help of Blackstone, can translate these very intelligible words out of <HI>common sense</HI> into <HI>common law.</HI> The oath in English says, <HI>you shall diligently enquire:</HI> in law, you shall sit and receive indictments, and only hear evidence on the part of the prosecution. <HI>You shall diligently enquire, and true presentment make,</HI> saith the oath—You are to consider your presentment only in the nature of an accusation, saith the law, or rather the lawyer. <HI>You shall pre∣sent the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,</HI> says the oath—You are only to enquire, saith the judge, whether there be <HI>sufficient</HI> cause to call upon the party to answer. Now some have said, that <HI>sufficient</HI> cause means <HI>probable</HI> cause; and <HI>probable</HI> means <HI>likely;</HI> and every thing that is <HI>likely,</HI> is at least <HI>possible:</HI> and so, by an irre∣fragible chain of reasoning, we may be hung in chains, according to the good pleasure of the judges and learned expounders of the law.</P>
<P>FOR my own part I honour judge <HI>Blackstone</HI> as
<PB N="223" REF="024407_0227_0FC705D52808FA48"/>
a profound and liberal expositor of law, except only where <HI>prerogative</HI> comes in question. The rays of <HI>prerogative</HI> are apt to warp the bench of justice, make it or what stuff you please.</P>
<P>LET us see how far the authority of this same judge Blackstone will carry us:—Turn to vol. i. p. 107, 108—<Q>Our American plantations, (says he,) being obtained either by right of conquest and driving out the natives, or by treaties, the common law of England, as such, has no allow∣ance or authority there; they being no part of the mother country, but distinct dominions sub∣ject to the controul of parliament.</Q>
And in p. 109:—<Q>And because several of the colonies had claimed the sole and exclusive right of imposing taxes upon themselves, the statute of the 6<SUP>th</SUP> of Geo. III. chap. 12, expressly declares, that all his majesty's colonies and plantations in America, have been, are, and of right ought to be, subor∣dinate to and dependent upon the imperial crown and parliament of Great-Britain: who have full power and authority to make laws and statutes of sufficient validity to bind the colonies and people of America, subjects to the crown of Great-Britain, in all cases whatsoever.</Q></P>
<P>NOW, good people, you have thought it essenti∣ally
<PB N="224" REF="024407_0228_0FC705D6A981E678"/>
necessary to your happiness, to deny the au∣thority of judge Blackstone, vol. i. p. 108; altho' fortified by the statute of the 6<SUP>th</SUP> of Geo. III.— But you have only done your business by halves, unless you will as firmly reject the authority of the said judge Blackstone, vol. iv. p. 300, although supported by the authority of <HI>Jurisperitus</HI> the first.</P>
<P>WHY did <HI>Jurisperitus</HI> stop just where he did, when he was quoting Blackstone?—Answer. —Because the very next sentence, which is but a short one, and concludes the paragraph, unfortu∣nately, does not support the doctrine of <HI>probable testimony</HI> he wishes to establish.—The sentence stands thus:—<Q>a grand jury, however, ought to be <HI>thoroughly</HI> persuaded of the truth of an in∣dictment, so far as their evidence goes, and not to rest satisfied merely with remote <HI>probabilities;</HI> a doctrine that <HI>might be applied to very oppressive purposes.</HI></Q>—State Trials, vol. iv. p. 183.</P>
<P>THIS device of picking out a part of a sentence, is like <HI>Lord Peter's</HI> method of expounding his father's will.</P>
<P>BUT what says judge <HI>Adrian?</HI> He tells us that a grand jury is—<HI>that part of legal machinery composed of unlearned men, to use the phraseology of
<PB N="225" REF="024407_0229_0FC705D826406F48"/>
the profession, which is regulated and controlled</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. yet judge <HI>Blackstone,</HI> vol. IV. page. 302. says that
<Q>to form a grand jury the sheriff of every county is bound to return &amp;c. twenty-four <HI>good and lawful</HI> men of the county. That they ought to be freeholders, but to what amount is uncer∣tain—however, they are usually men of the <HI>best figure</HI> in the county.</Q></P>
<P>I have thought a good deal of this same idea of a <HI>legal machine,</HI> and am of opinion that <HI>Adrian</HI> must have drawn his idea from the <HI>pillory,</HI> which is, in truth, <HI>a legal machine,</HI> and very like his no∣tion of a grand jury. A poor devil is fixed neck and hands in this engine of the law by his accuser. The court furnishes rotten eggs, and the attorney general pelts him <HI>secundum artem;</HI> whilst the suf∣ferer is not permitted to wipe away even the slime of a single egg. After he has been sufficiently besmeared to the entire satisfaction of his enemies, he is taken in this filthy condition to the petit jury, who may, if <HI>Adrian</HI> pleases, represent another <HI>legal machine,</HI> called a <HI>gallows</HI>—there he is to make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imself clean, if he can, and if he cannot, he is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> clear off to be hanged. If, however, he should be so fortunate as to escape, he is to fall down upon his knees,
<Q>cry out God save the commonwealth and the honourable court!</Q>
pay
<PB N="226" REF="024407_0230_0FC705E05929E500"/>
all costs and charges, and go about his business: and this is called <HI>justice.</HI> But if this is indeed <HI>justice,</HI> it is so manufactured that the original sim∣ple is lost in the compound.</P>
<P>BUT, my good fellow citizens, let us not be de∣ceived by a parade of idle authorities, and more idle reasonings upon them. You must all see and know that the use of grand juries is to guard the first entrance into the law, to prevent any one's being unnecessarily exposed to its rigour. If grand juries do their duty, an enemy shall not have it in his power to come behind a man and push him unawares into that pool of perdition, from which it is so difficult to escape, that the clerk of the court, when he has arraigned the prisoner, always adds, <HI>God send you a good deliverance!</HI></P>
<P>THOUGH judge Mansfield, judge Blackstone, judge <HI>Jurisperitus,</HI> judge <HI>Adrian,</HI> and all the jud∣ges since the reign of Chares I. should, with one voice, tell you that, after a grand jury hath taken the oath above recited, they may indict a man upon slight grounds and <HI>probable</HI> testimony—believe them not. That they will have made <HI>diligent</HI> in∣quiry, when in fact they have made no inquiry at all, but only received such evidence as the pro∣secutor shall offer—believe them not. That a
<PB N="227" REF="024407_0231_0FC705E1EC79C1E8"/>
grand jury is nothing more than a <HI>legal machine,</HI> contrived to give a formal sanction to the will of the judge—believe them not. But rather watch those who dare to advance doctrines so dangerous to the lives, estates, and reputations of the citizens of a free government.</P>

<L>Is not so very hard to shew:—</L>

<HEAD>A NEW GAME WITH CARDS FOR THE IM∣PROVEMENT OF <HI>ORTHOGRAPHY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>LET a pack, consisting of 104 cards, be prepared, by printing on each card—(with engraved orna∣ments, if you please) a letter; so that there may be four sets of the alphabet viz. 1st. a set of red capitals; 2d. red small letters; 3d. black capitals; 4th, black small <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etters—Thus there will be four suits, as in common playing cards; each suit con∣sisting of 26 cards, or letters, of one colour and kind.</P>
<P>AS many as please may play at this game: but the number cannot conveniently be less than five.</P>
<P>BEFORE the cards are dealt, every player should take a number of counters, suppose a dozen, which must all be thrown into a saucer or pool.</P>
<P>THE pack having been well shuffled, is set on the table, and the dealer takes from the top as ma∣ny as he may judge sufficient for a deal (because it may be inconvenient to handle so large a pack),
<PB N="240" REF="024407_0244_0FC70616C747BD30"/>
and then deals round by <HI>twos</HI> till each person has got 10 cards. The remainder, if any, he must again lay on the pack. This done, each person sorts his hand. The cards rank according to the rank in which the letters they respectively bear stand in the alphabet—Thus, an (a) is superior to a (b), and to any subsequent letter of its own class. Capitals bear alike rank amongst them∣selves; but the lowest capital is superior to the high∣est small letter of its own colour—Therefore a capi∣tal Z will win a small (a) of the same colour; but it should be observed that the red letters are always superior to the black; so that a small red (Z) will take a capital black (A). The red letters are to be considered as trumps. There is no other distinc∣tion of powers in the letters, except this viz. that the capital red (W) (which should be distinguish∣ed by particular ornaments in honour of the name of WASHINGTON) is superior to any other card or cards whatever; it may be played down at any time the possessor pleases, without regard to the lead, and always wins the trick in which it is played; an∣swering to the <HI>spadil</HI> in quadril, or <HI>pam</HI> in <HI>lu.</HI></P>
<P>THE cards being dealt, the eldest hand plays; sup∣pose a small black letter, the next, and all the rest, must play a black letter also, but it may be either a small or a capital letter. If the person to play
<PB N="241" REF="024407_0245_0FC7061809ECC580"/>
cannot follow the colour, he may trump, that s, play down any red letter he has got. When all have played, he wins the trick, who hath played the letter of the highest rank; the trick must then be gathered up and laid by itself, not mixing it with other tricks that may be won afterwards.</P>
<P>TO avoid confusion and disputes, it will be best for every person, when he plays, to lay his card down before him, and not throw the cards toge∣ther in the middle of the table as at whist; in order that it may be certainly known what card each person hath played, and who hath won the trick.</P>
<P>THE first trick being gathered up, the winner leads, and the play goes on as before.</P>
<P>WHEN all the 10 cards in each hand have been played out, the eldest, if he hath been a winner, begins by spreading one of his tricks open on the table. If there should be six players, each trick will consist of six cards or letters; if seven, of seven, &amp;c. He is then, out of the letters of each trick, to compose as many well spelled Eng∣lish words as he can; but he must not use or mix the letters of one trick with those of another, should he have more than one: And for every word so composed he is to draw a stake or stakes from the pool.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="024407_0246_0FC706199BF1B790"/>No word, however, must consist of less than three letters, and the names of persons and places are not to be admitted.</P>
<P>IN forming the words, no regard is to be had whether the letters are black orred, capital or small —all the letters of a single trick may be used pro∣miscuously, except that if the party can make out a word with all red letters, he is to draw double stakes tor it. Lastly, a stake is to be drawn for every syllable of which the word consists—always drawing double for what is performed with red letters only.</P>
<P>AFTER a winner hath examined his trick, and drawn from the pool, or thrown it aside as af∣fording nothing, if any other player can discover a word in that trick which the winner did not ob∣serve, the discoverer shall draw the stakes due for that word for himself.</P>
<P>THE tricks being all examined, the whole pack must be well shuffled, and the next in turn deal∣ing, the game goes on as before. When the pool is exhausted those who have gained more than their first deposit are the winners, and those who are deficient are by so much losers.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="observation">
<PB N="243" REF="024407_0247_0FC7061B0153DBE8"/>
<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>AS the cards are not all dealt out in one hand, no one can tell what letters will be against him in each round, he will, therefore, be cautious or bold, according to circumstances, in risking his best letters. As success does not depend on the number of tricks won, but on the words such tricks will furnish, each player will be careful of his vowels, without which no word can be form∣ed, and of such consonants as experience shall shew to be most serviceable in the composition of words. If, therefore, he is likely to lose the trick, he will throw down such a letter as he shall judge, from a view of the cards played, may lead benefit the win∣ner; but, if he thinks he shall make the trick his own, he will enrich it with a vowel, or some valu∣able consonant, as far as the rules of the game shall permit.</P>
<P>THE letters having these powers assigned to them, according to their rank, colour, and size, will admit of great varieties and improvements in play; but as this game is chiefly intended for children, a too great intricacy is purposely avoided.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="024407_0248_0FC7062351777750"/>N. B. The same letters in any one trick may be used again and again, provided they can be made to form different words. For example; suppose the letters of a trick should be P, S, E, T, R, C, E,—they will compose the follow∣ing words, viz. <HI>set, pet, specter</HI> and <HI>scepter;</HI> and would draw 8. stakes, or 16 if they should be all red letters.</P>
<P>TWO persons may play, if they agree before hand how many cards shall make a trick; for in∣stance, 4 or 5; otherwise there would be but two letters to a trick, which would not do.</P>

<HEAD>SOME ACCOUNT OF A NEWLY DISCOVERED AND MOST COMMODIOUS METHOD OF WRITING; WHEREBY AN AUTHOR OF LITTLE OR NO GENIUS WILL BE ENABLED TO EXPRESS HIMSELF WITH MECHANICAL PRO∣PRIETY. INVENTED AND FIRST MADE KNOWN BY <HI>A. B.</HI> GENT.</HEAD>
<P>GENIUS is the gift of heaven, and manifests it∣self by emanations altogether unexpected and surprising. Its powers are not to be obtained by application and study, but they may be assisted by <HI>art.</HI> When <HI>genius</HI> hath brought forth, <HI>art</HI> takes up and nurses the child, and carefully consult∣ing its features, deduces rules for a happy con∣ception.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="024407_0250_0FC7062B69A0AD60"/>SUCH being the connection between <HI>genius</HI> and <HI>art,</HI> it is but reasonable that a mutual intercourse of good offices should subsist between them. For my own part, I must confess that nature hath not been over bountiful to me in the article of genius; but I am desirous of exerting the little she hath given in behalf of those who may have no more than myself. For this purpose I have devised a method of writing on any subject; in which not only the sound may be an echo to the sense, if any sense there be, but the eye also shall be gratified with an exhibition of mechanical elegance and propriety; the only elegance perhaps to which such writers can attain.</P>
<P>BY this scheme the construction of a paragraph, the progress of a line, and even the disposition of the words, may all contribute to enforce the idea intended.</P>
<P>IT would be a tedious talk to form a system of rules for this new method of writing, or to give a description at large of my useful device; one ex∣ample will fully explain the whole, so as to enable an author of the meanest capacity to understand and profit by the design; and a little practice will make it familiar to him.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="sample">
<PB N="247" REF="024407_0251_0FC70632C4EC6FE0"/>
<HEAD>A SAMPLE OF GOOD WRITING.</HEAD>
<P>AN author who wishes to height to the rise of excellence of <HI>good writing,</HI> must condescend to call in me∣chanical propriety to his aid. He cannot be sublime: all at once but gradually descending to the profound, should as gradually rise to elegance, frequently forming a serpentine line, in which, ac∣cording to Hogarth, the beauty of all things consists.</P>
<P>AND whether he writes in plain prose;</P>
<L><PB N="248" REF="024407_0252_0FC706347059C6F0"/>
Or would in verse his thoughts convey,</L>
<L>His rhyming talents to display;</L>
<P>and the diction strict propriety should prevail, and the sense run parallel to each other; pleasing as well the eye as the ear.</P>
<P>SOME have a happy talent for expression, where∣by they compensate for the want of sentiment by the enchanting melody of their stile. Their lan∣guage ever flowing like the waves of the sea, and their periods closing in such musical cadence, that the ear is fascinated by the magic of sound, and the mind lull'd in a pleasing repose.</P>
<P>OTHERS, without giving to grammar rules of∣fence, shall arrange so unskilfully their words; breaking as it were, and interrupting the sense (or rather nonsense) they mean to communicate, by frequent (and oft times unnecessary) parenthesis, that the ear stumbles over their rugged paragraphs,
<PB N="249" REF="024407_0253_0FC70635EF5D2EE0"/>
as the feet would stumble in scrambling through a street, when the pavement had been broken up; over stones bricks, and posts, mixed together confusedly.</P>
<P>THE mind of the reader is more fa—ti— gu—ed by travelling through a sentence so constructed, than it would be in gliding through a whole page of harmonious phraseology.</P>
<P>YOUR precise grammarians are most apt to write in this stile, thinking that they have well acquitted themselves, if the strict rules of syntax are in no instance violated. The labourer who mixes the mortar, and he who carries the hod, may as well pretend to skill in architecture, as these haberdash∣ers of moods and tenses may pretend to taste and elegance in composition.</P>
<P>OTHERS there are who affect a singularity of stile above the vulgar. It is indubitable verity, that their
<PB N="250" REF="024407_0254_0FC7063763DB94A8"/>
phrases are collated from the most approved au∣thors, and applied with the most becoming apti∣tude, even to the very point of precision in pro∣priety; every period is polished and rounded off as round aye, as round as a robin. Whilst others scorn the <HI>ORNAMENTS</HI> of language, deal in demonstration and write, and act ever on the square.</P>
<P>BY the foregoing example it is evident, that not only an author's sentiments may be more forcibly impressed on the mind, but the reader's memory will also be greatly assisted, if happily any thing so written should be worth remembering.</P>
<P>ANOTHER advantage is, that such performan∣ces may with great ease be reduced to a kind of
<PB N="251" REF="024407_0255_0FC7063E4BE2A5F8"/>

<HEADNOTE>
<P>☞ AN act of assembly passed in April 1782, directing all the trees in the streets of Philadelphia to be cut down and removed; the following publication appeared in opposition. THE law was never executed, and soon after repealed.</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<HEAD>For the Pennsylvania Gazette.</HEAD>
<P>LOOKING over a file of papers, which lay on my table, I found a very extraordinary speech, delivered by a very extraordinary orator, in our house of assembly in April last, which I had taken down in short hand, but not from the <HI>mouth</HI> of the speaker. I much wonder that this oration, with the surprising circumstances that attended it, have not been noticed in any of the public prints: I hope the following account of that transaction will not be thought unworthy of a place in the Pennsylvania Gazette.</P>
<P>ON the 12th of April last, the house took into consideration, and debated by paragraphs, a bill entitled,
<Q>An act for regulating party-walls and partition-fences, in the city of Philadelphia, &amp;c.</Q>
when, to the amazement of all present, the business was interrupted by a voice, perfectly articulate, proceeding from the capital of one of the columns which supported the ceiling of the room.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="024407_0257_0FC706412D1A9D98"/>THIS voice claimed a right to be heard on the subject of the bill then before the house.</P>
<P>AFTER the first surprise at such an unusual pro∣digy had a little subsided, the right of a column to interfere in the business of the house was consi∣dered and objected to; and it was urged, that no instance had ever occured where a <HI>wooden mem∣ber</HI>—a <HI>blockhead</HI>—had presumed to speak in that assembly: that this column could, by no con∣struction of law, be admitted as the represen∣tative of any part or district of Pennsylvania, having never been ballotted for, elected, or returned as a member of assembly—That the house, when fully met, necessarily consisted of a certain number of members, <HI>and no more,</HI> and that this number is full and complete, by the returns from the several counties, as ap∣pears by the records of the house: therefore, if this column should be allowed a voice, there must be a supernumerary member somewhere, which would be an absolute violation of the con∣stitution. And lastly, that it is contrary to the order of nature that an <HI>inanimate</HI> log should interfere in the affairs of rational beings; providence ha∣ving been pleased to distinguish so obviously be∣tween <HI>men</HI> and <HI>things.</HI></P>
<P>TO all this the column <HI>firmly</HI> replied—That he
<PB N="254" REF="024407_0258_0FC706443B5E16F0"/>
was, properly speaking, a <HI>standing member</HI> of that house, having been duly fixed in his station by those who had the right and power to place him there—That he was the true representative of a numerous race, descended in a direct line from the aborigines of this country—those venerable ancestors who gave the name of <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> to this state, and whose posterity now inhabit eve∣ry county in it—That he was not only a member of the house, but one of its principal <HI>supporters,</HI> in as much as they could never <HI>make a house</HI> with∣out him—That he had faithfully attended the pub∣lic business, having never been fined as an absentee —And that those very members who now opposed him, had confided in his wisdom and intregrity, by constantly appealing to him <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The rules of the house are framed and hung up against one of the columns.</NOTE> in every contest about the rules and internal economy of the house. And, lastly, that as the bill under consideration so nearly concerned his fellow creatures; and as he found himself miraculously endowed with the power of speech for this occasion, he was determined to make use of it in behalf of those who could not speak for themselves. After much debate, it was determined that the house would hear what this importunate post had to say respect∣ing
<PB N="255" REF="024407_0259_0FC7064757B84BD0"/>
the bill before them: but peremtorily re∣fused to allow him a vote on this or any other business in that assembly.</P>
<P>THE columnar orator, having obtained leave, addressed the house in the following and words.</P>
<P>"I am happy, oh! fellow citizens that speech hath been given me on this important occasion: and that I have your permission to exercise a power, thus wonderfully obtained, in the cause of truth and justice.</P>
<P>"I <HI>stand</HI> here this day an <HI>upright</HI> advocate for injured innocence. What fury—what madness— oh! deluded senators! hath induced you to propose the extirpation of those to whom you are indebted for so many of the elegancies, comforts, and bles∣sings of life? If the voice of justice is not to be regarded within these walls, let your own inte∣rests influence your conduct on this occasion. For I hope to shew that your safety and happiness are much more deeply concerned, in the business you are upon, than you are at present aware of.</P>
<P>"By the 12th section of the bill now depen∣pending, it is proposed to cut down and remove
<PB N="256" REF="024407_0260_0FC70648A90480E8"/>
all the trees standing in the streets, lanes, or alleys of this city—What! do we then hold our lives on such an uncertain tenure? Shall the respectable and inoffensive inhabitants of this city <HI>stand</HI> or <HI>fall</HI> according to the caprice of a few ignorant petiti∣oners? And will this house without remorse, with∣out even the form of trial, give its sanction to an edict, which hath not a parallel since the sangui∣nary days of Herod of Jewry! But I hope to con∣vince this honourable house that <HI>trees,</HI> as well as <HI>men,</HI> are capable of enjoying the rights of citizen∣ship, and therefore ought to be protected in those rights—that having committed no offence, this arbitary edict cannot <HI>constitutionally</HI> pass a∣gainst them—and that your own, and the wel∣fare of your constituents, is nearly concerned in their preservation and culture.</P>
<P>"THE superiority which man hath assumed over what he calls the <HI>irrational</HI> and <HI>inanimate</HI> parts of the creation, is a superiority only founded in in his own pride and ignorance of our nature and faculties—The same divine hand that for∣med you formed us; also the same elements that nourish you nourish us like you; we are compo∣sed of bones, blood-vessels, fibres, and, for ought you know, muscles and nerves—Wit∣ness
<PB N="257" REF="024407_0261_0FC7064BD7DECB48"/>
the whole class of sensitive plants, wherein involuntary motion is made sensible even to your gross vision—like you, we die, and return to the earth from which we sprang, and then even the wisest amongst you cannot distin∣guish between the dust of an <HI>elm</HI> and of a <HI>emperor.</HI></P>
<P>"BUT I go much farther, and assert from your own authorities, that we sleep and wake; that we are male and female; that we are married and given in marriage; and that we propogate our species to fuller effect, and in a manner somewhat similar to what you do yourselves. In support of these doctrines, I could cite many respectable au∣thorities from the ancients; and amongst the mo∣derns <HI>Grew, Millington, Ray, Camerarius, More∣land, Geoffroy, Vaillant,</HI> and above all, your favou∣rite <HI>Linnaeus.</HI></P>
<P>"WHEREIN then doth the vast difference be∣tween men and the vegetable kingdom consist? I am bold to ask, wherein doth it consist? Oh! cries yon∣der loquacious lord of the creation, we can <HI>converse,</HI> we can <HI>reason</HI>: Oh! cries yonder restless and <HI>fidgetting</HI> member, we can move from place to place. To the latter I answer, so can an <HI>ass,</HI> an <HI>owl,</HI> an <HI>Eel,</HI> and to much better advantage than he can, with all his
<PB N="258" REF="024407_0262_0FC70656A7EA3360"/>
locomotive faculties. The former requires a more serious reply.</P>
<P>"WE can <HI>converse,</HI> we can <HI>reason.</HI> Be it so, Man, arbitrary man, hath affixed certain ideas to certain sounds. If these sounds or noises are adapted to his miserable apprehension, they are called <HI>language, reason, music,</HI> and what not. But if the man should not be wise enough to understand the meaning of the noise he hears, he does not hesitate to pro∣nounce it <HI>jargon, nonsence, unintelligible stuff</HI>— Thus, for instance, a man stands up and makes a long noise, called <HI>philosophy, divinity, law,</HI> &amp;c. an ass lifts up his head, and makes a much greater noise, and it is called <HI>braying:</HI> yet to his own species, the ass is an intelligent creature, and his language is well un∣derstood by them. If then man can thus mistake the matter with respect to brutes, although he sees that nature hath given them the apparent organs of speech, and daily hears them exercise these organs for the purposes intended, may he not also be mistaken with respect to the language of plants? a language too refined to make any impression on his gross and callous senses? That such a language doth actually exist, might be proved from the authority of holy writ; wherein we are frequently told, that the valleys rejoice and sing, and the cedars of Lebanon praise the Lord. But

I shall content myself with reading to your honours a passage to this purpose from that ingenious au∣thor <HI>Cyrano de Bergerac</HI>—Voyage to the Moon p. 91.</P>
<P><Q>—THIS fancy of eating by himself made me cu∣rious to know the reason of it. I was answered, that he chose not to taste either the odor of meats or of herbs,unless they had died spontane∣ously: because he imagined them beings capable of grief. I am not much surprised, replied I, that some orders of people here abstain from flesh and things that have sensitive life; yet it seems to me ridiculous to fear hurting a cab∣bage in the cutting. For my part, replied the de∣mon, I must own there appears to me good rea∣son for such an opinion. For is not a cabbage a being existing in nature as you are? Have you not both her equally for your mother? and she is more immediately so to the vegetable than to the rational production. The generation of the latter she hath left to the whim of a pa∣tent: a rigour she doth not extend to the former, in as much as she <HI>obliges</HI> one to produce ano∣ther. And whilst one man is scarcely able to get more than a score of his species at best, a head of cabbage shall produce four or five hundred of
<PB N="260" REF="024407_0264_0FC706592B73D720"/>
its own sort. Should we say that nature hath a greater esteem for a man then she has for a cab∣bage, it would be only with a view to make us laugh; for nature is in incapable of passion, and can neither love nor hate. If she was susceptible of love, she certainly would have a greater ten∣derness for the inoffensive cabbage, than for the unrelenting man who destroys it.</Q>
And again p. 95.</P>
<P><Q>—Who has given us the knowledge of certain beings superior to us, to whom we are neither related nor proportioned, and whose existence we find it as difficult to conceive, as the manner in which a cabbage can address itself to its own species? To understand which com∣munication our senses are too weak, remember, if you can, amongst all the species of animals one more proud than the cabbage: who, while you destroy him, is above complaining; yet tho' he disdains to murmur, he thinks, nevertheless, the more. If he wants such organs as you are master of, formed for wailings and tears, yet he has o∣thers where-with to implore heaven to revenge the injury done him, and expects it will not be with-held. It is not unlikely but you may ask, how I know the cabbage has these fine thoughts? but inform me first, can you prove it has not? or that, at the close of the night, the Russia cab∣bage

does not say to the savoy, <HI>good savoy, your most humble servant!</HI></Q></P>
<P>"BUT still, says man, we have <HI>rationality</HI> and <HI>risibility</HI> to distinguish us from the rest of the creation; that is, when nature gave one man the power to <HI>reason,</HI> she gave another the power to <HI>laugh</HI> at him. For our parts, we confess, we never <HI>reason</HI>; we are satisfied with being directed by the laws of nature, which fully enable us to answer the end of our creation. We pretend not to be wiser than the hand that made us, and therefore we are guilty of no follies or excesses. We employ none of our powers in devising means for the more speedy and effectual destruction of our species: we do all the good we can; and when we can do no more, we retire from our present form of exi∣stence to make room for our successors.</P>
<P>"THIS <HI>rationality,</HI> on which you so much value yourselves, is, in my opinion, a striking mark of imbecility and disgrace, a punishment inflicted on your race, doubtless, for some heinous offence heretofore committed. The intelligent beings of the spiritual world never <HI>reason</HI>; they see truth <HI>intuitively;</HI> they know the whole chain of causes and effects; they see, that in a triangle, the great∣est angle must be subtended by the longest side,
<PB N="262" REF="024407_0266_0FC70660F7784970"/>
without any reasoning upon the problem. And in terrestrial nature there is no creature but <HI>man</HI> that is obliged to <HI>reason.</HI> They all perform their respective functions with precision and certainty under the influence of a law that cannot err; whilst your <HI>reason</HI> is ever involving you in difficul∣ties and absurdities; is ever deducing false con∣clusions from false premises; and the wiser you think yourselves the more mischief you generally do: what is reason one day is not reason ano∣ther. About thirty years ago you <HI>reasoned</HI> upon the disease called the small-pox; and thousands in every city and country fell sacrifices to your <HI>ra∣tional</HI> system. But you have now discovered that your system is no longer <HI>rational,</HI> and have adopt∣ed a quite different mode of practice. Accident, not reason, discovered your error; and fact and nature contradicted the learned arguments of ma∣ny a lengthy treatise on the subject: and this has been the case in every art and science; the solid reasonings of one age have been disputed, found fallacious, and despised by another.</P>
<P>BESIDES this, your reason teaches you to square all nature by your ideas of truth, and you know not what truth is: For instance, you eat, and drink, and walk, and you say I have <HI>life:</HI> but yonder willow can do none of these, therefore it is <HI>inani∣mate.</HI>

Deluded man!

Do you not see that all the exhibitions in nature are but so many different modifications and manifestations of one original essence or principle? Is not the gravity which re∣tains Jupiter in his orbit, the same gravity which operates on a grain in the scales of a Jew? The intelligent beings above you amuse themselves with the ridiculous blunders your <HI>rationality</HI> is continu∣ally making. They despise the wretch, who, stretch∣es every faculty of his mind to amass a hoard of wealth, which he has not the spirit to enjoy; they pity the inevitable fate of the voluptuous, and the vain toils of ambition; but they laugh incessantly at the folly of him who ransacks the earth to ga∣ther sticks and stones, shells and bones, and after spending years in arranging them to his mind, makes a raree-show of his collection, and struts a <HI>philosopher,</HI> full of self-importance and vain conceit.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="024407_0268_0FC7066CD858DD48"/>"IF follies, absurdities, and mistakes, were the only effects of your boasted <HI>reason,</HI> they might be patiently borne with; but when you exercise it to over-reach, ruin, and destroy each other; when you exert its powers to conceal or embarrass truth; to establish falsehood and injustice; to lead the blind out of his way, and the lame into a ditch; to render yourselves more ingeniously wicked, and more effectually mischievous; those divine in∣telligences look down with disgust and horror on your boasted reason. They turn aside from the hateful object, and contemplate with pleasure the stately oak and the wide spreading beech; the water-loving willow, and the fruitful vine; e∣ven all the vegetable creation, which from the pine that waves on the mountains' height, to the herb that drinks the dew of the valley, fill with exact propriety their respective stations, and are invariably governed by the laws of nature, which are the laws of truth and wisdom.</P>
<P>AFTER all, your reason is but instinct broke lose; or rather instinct is reason confined within proper limits, and directed to the proper objects. Do not then presume upon a faculty which, upon the whole, will be found to be the curse of your species. To prove this, you need only look into history for the facts and characters of former

<P>"I might now, may it please your honours, point out many circumstances wherein nature hath evi∣dently and most advantageously distinguished the vegetable part of her works from man, by giv∣ing them a real and substantial superiority. But, lest I should wander too far in so large a field, and encroach upon your patience, I will confine myself to one instance only—when a man dies, when he can no longer perform the functions of life, his body becomes, in a few hours, a loath∣some mass of corruption, which his nearest friends hurry away, and put out of sight forever. It is not so with us, witness my appearance here this day. It is now many years since I lost my vegetable life by the fatal ax—my skin was stript off, and my limbs lopt away—and yet you see my body is still of use, and I stand here <HI>firm, sound,</HI> and <HI>hearty.</HI> And, barring an accident from all consuming fire, I shall attend future debates in this house, when those whom I have the honour now to address <HI>shall be no more.</HI></P>
<P>"HAVING, as I hope, fully proved that trees, as well as men, are capable of citizenship, I shall now proceed to consider the crimes with which the trees of this city have been charged, and which
<PB N="266" REF="024407_0270_0FC706729C69F8B8"/>
the 12<SUP>th</SUP> section of the bill before the house is intended to punish.</P>
<P><Q>The preamble to this section sets forth— Whereas trees growing in the public streets, lanes, and alleys of the said city of Philadelphia do obstruct the prospect and passage through the same, and also disturb the water-courses and foot-ways, by the extending and encrease of the roots thereof, and must tend to spread fires when any break out within the said city: <HI>Be it therefore enacted,</HI> &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>"YOUR honours have an old saying, called a pro∣verb, which naturally occurs on this occasion: <HI>It is easy to find a stick to beat a dog.</HI> That is, a man is never at a loss for a reason for punishing those who are in his power, and whom he wishes to op∣press. But these trees, it seems, obstruct the pro∣spect—of what? of many wretched buildings and some dirty alleys. For I deny that any one ele∣gant street or building in this city is more ob∣structed by trees than is necessary to the comfort of the inhabitants, and to give beauty to the pro∣spect. Men of taste have always thought that a due mixture of trees and buildings—the beauties of nature and art harmonizing with each other —elegant architecture discovered through luxu∣riant
<PB N="267" REF="024407_0271_0FC706736D3A5E80"/>
foliage, compose an exhibition truly delightful and sublime. But it seems your honours think otherwise. This preamble, therefore, should have stood thus—<Q>Whereas a moderate proportion of trees is supposed to be a great ornament to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> city, and whereas we have no taste whatever for elegance and ornament: <HI>Be it therefore enacted,</HI> &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>"IT is said, that these trees obstruct the passage: but surely this charge is not supported by fact. They have modestly ported themselves as close to the gutters and water-courses as they can, leaving both foot-way and cart-way free and open. If, how∣ever, any straggler should be found so obstructing the passage, let him die the death—I have nothing to say in his behalf: but it is farther urged, that the aforesaid trees disturb and disorder the water-courses and foot-ways by the extension of their roots—if so, cut off the offending roots, but do not destroy the whole tree. When justice exceeds her limits, she forfeits her name. Lastly, trees com∣municate fire—Now, a tree hath no greater ene∣my in nature than fire: cut him into inch pieces, grind him into dust, it will still exist <HI>as wood</HI> for ma∣ny, many years. Fire alone can suddenly separate its component parts, and destroy its name. How then can it be apprehended that we should unite
<PB N="268" REF="024407_0272_0FC706761DE7D688"/>
with our most inveterate foe for the destruction of the city, or join in the mischievous purposes of a <HI>common incendiary,</HI> whose power we have most reason to dread?</P>
<P>"BESIDES the charges laid in the bill, two others have been suggested against these devoted trees, viz. that they obstruct the operation of the engines in case of fire; and that they are not well affected to the present government, because they remained with the enemy when they had possession of the city.</P>
<P>"AS to the first, little need be said in answer. When the case occurs, let the obstacle be re∣moved. It is as easy to procure an ax as an act of assembly; and the removal may be easily and speedily accomplished. But to depopulate a whole city, for the possible offence of a few individuals, is surely neither law nor reason.</P>
<P>"IN reply to the second charge, I would ask, Will any one pretend to say, that the leaving or not leaving the city on the approach of the ene∣my marks the true line of distinction between <HI>whig</HI> and <HI>tory</HI>? It is confessed that we remained when others fled; we stood our ground, and heroic∣ally suffered in our country's cause. Turn, worthy

senators! Turn your eyes to yonder fields! Look towards the banks of the <HI>Schulkyl!</HI> Where are now those verdant groves that used to close the prospect and enrich the scene? Where are now those venerable oaks, that o'er the evening walk of sober citizen, of musing bard, of sportive youths, and sighing nymphs and swains, were wont to spread their hospitable shade? Alas! nought now remains but lifeless stumps that moulder in the summer's heat and winter's frost—the habitations fit of poisonous funge, toads, and ever gnawing Worms. <HI>Hinc illae Lachrymae!</HI> These were thy feats, oh, <HI>Howe!</HI> Excuse, great Sirs, this <HI>weakness</HI> in a <HI>post,</HI> or rather join your sympathetic tears with mine—the loss is yours—a loss, the import∣ance of which you have not, perhaps, duly consi∣dered; which I shall now endeavour to present to your attention.</P>
<P>"HAVING shewn, and I hope to the satisfaction of my hearers, the rank my fellow-trees hold in the scale of beings: their capacities of pleasure and pain, having also obviated the charges brought against them, and touched upon their sufferings in the great political revolution in this country, I come now to the last argument intended for their defence, I mean the great life and importance they are of to mankind. And here I shall be ve∣ry

concise, avoiding to mention those numerous circumstances in which trees obviously contribute to the pleasure, convenience, and profit of men, con∣fining myself to one serious consideration, viz. How far the healths and lives of the citizens of Phila∣delphia may be concerned in the business you have now in hand. A few hours will be sufficient to execute this fatal law; but it will take many years to repair the damage when you shall have disco∣vered your error. Consider, therefore, oh! rash and capricious mortals, what you are about to do; whilst consideration may be of any use, caution is never too late, repentance may be. Know that these trees, whom you are about to extirpate, are your best, your safest physicians; the health of your citizens depends upon their preservation and growth; and you are now to decide, not only upon the existence of a few trees, but possibly on the lives of hundreds of your fellow-creatures. I say, these trees are your best, your safest physi∣cians. They have published no books, therefore they have no systems to defend. Their practice is ever uniform, dictated by nature, and establish∣ed by success, and, therefore, they make no whim∣sical experiments, uncertain in every thing but mi∣sery and death. In a word, they have no occasion to kill <HI>one hundred</HI> in order to learn how to cure <HI>one.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="024407_0275_0FC70680F002E8A8"/>"IN the autumn they modestly drop their foli∣age, to admit the comfortable rays of the sun to your dwellings, their leaves being then of no far∣ther use to you. But no sooner does the spring advance, but they arm themselves in your defence; they see the enemy approach—innumerable little deaths, in various subtle forms. These are by the fermenting heats of summer, generated in every pool, gutter, and common sewer, and in all the murky filth of your city. No sooner have the poisonous atoms acquired sufficient malignity, but they leave their native cells and float in air. One of these inhaled, infects the blood; and soon a hus∣band, son, or father falls. To prevent this, the friendly tree spreads its broad and numerous foli∣age. Every leaf is expanded to intercept and ab∣sorb the floating mischief. And thus receiving and digesting the noxious particles, they purify the ambient air. For this important philosophy, you are indebted to <HI>Priestley, Ingenhouse,</HI> and <HI>Fonta∣na.</HI> The enemy had studied these authors, when they cut the trees from yonder plain: hoping thereby to leave the atmosphere poisoned for your destruction. Is it not obvious that diseases most prevail when vegetation begins to cease? About the middle of August most leaves have acquired their utmost growth; they are then saturated with the noxious vapours, and can no longer perform
<PB N="272" REF="024407_0276_0FC706826858C410"/>
their friendly office: and from that time, to the first frost of the season, (which concludes the ge∣neration of these pernicious airs,) sickness and deaths are most frequent.</P>
<P>"AND will you then, oh, guardians of the peo∣ple! will you, by a fatal decree, banish from among you, those salutary citizens, to whom you are so much indebted for the blessings of health, with∣out which, every other temporal blessing is of little value? And what advantage do you propose to yourselves by the execution of this law? your streets and alleys, indeed, will not be obstructed by trees, but they may be obstructed by frequent funerals and mournful processions.—I will not pro∣long the subject—If your honours will but balance the imaginary good with the real dangers that will attend your present purpose, I am confident, that your zeal for the public safety, will induce you to remove—not the trees from the streets of this city, but the 12<SUP>th</SUP> section from the bill under conside∣ration.</P>
<P>"I have but one thing more to add; and that is, that by the 15<SUP>th</SUP> section of your constitution, you are enjoined not to pass any law, except on occa∣sions of sudden necessity, until the next session af∣ter the same hath been proposed and published for
<PB N="273" REF="024407_0277_0FC70683E2107968"/>
consideration. No such necessity appears in the present case—the roots and branches of these de∣voted trees will not encrease to such a ruinous and enormous size, between this and the next session of assembly, as to render immediate amputation ne∣cessary.</P>
<P>"I would be far from supposing this honourable house capable of malice or partiality; yet I must observe, that this bill hath been hurried through the forms of legislation with unusual speed. You have spent much precious time in determining whe∣ther A. or B. should sit for a certain time in a cer∣tain chair; but do not hesitate to doom to death a number of quiet, harmless, and beneficent citizens, without remorse, without enquiry, without even the common forms of justice."</P>
<P>HERE the orator ceased, and was dumb. The house was more surprised at the manner, than at∣tentive to the matter of this curious speech. The question was put, and the clause passed without a dissenting voice; notwithstanding the importunate eloquence of this philosophic post.</P>

<PB N="274" REF="024407_0278_0FC7068AB4266B08"/>
<HEAD>DESCRIPTION OF A MACHINE FOR MEASURING A <HI>SHIP's WAY</HI> THROUGH THE SEA.</HEAD>
<P>THE errors and uncertainties incident to the mariner's log, are too obvious not to be universally acknowledged. Were it not for the observations navigators are accustomed to make of a ship's pro∣gress by the apparent passage of the water along side, and the signs that usually present on approach∣ing the land, the log alone would be a very unsafe dependence.</P>
<P>SEVERAL attempts have therefore been made to improve the log, and render its indications more accurate, but without success. All the machines of this kind, that I have heard of, were composed of a number of wheels, which were to be put in motion by the twisting of a line let out astern, having a drag at the end, so constructed, as to whirl round, faster or slower, according to the progressive motion of the ship.</P>
<P>THE objections to a machine so constructed are; <HI>first,</HI> if the line is not very long, the drag will be
<PB N="275" REF="024407_0279_0FC7068C51631878"/>
considerably affected by the ship's wake; and if it is very long, the twistings will be irregular, and the line liable to kink. <HI>Secondly,</HI> if the drag is so heavy as to sink below the bottoms of the waves, when the ship sails fast, it will be too heavy, and sink too deep, when she is under little way: or otherwise, if the drag is of a proper weight when the ship is under little way, it will skip from wave to wave when she sails with a brisk gale, and so be of no use. And, <HI>thirdly,</HI> it will be liable to most of the other irregularities to which the log in com∣mon use is exposed.</P>
<P>THE machine now proposed, will, it is hoped, be free from at least some of these objections. And although it may not be able to ascertain a ship's way through the sea to perfect precision, yet if it should be found to answer the purpose better; than any instrument hitherto contrived, it may be admitted as an acquisition to the art of navigation.</P>
<P>THIS machine, in its most simple form, is repre∣sented by fig. 1.—AB is a strong rod of iron, moveable on the joint or fulcrum; CD is a thin circular plate of brass, rivetted to the lower extre∣mity of the rod; E an horizontal arm, connected at one end with the top of the rod AB by a moveable joint F, and at the other end with the
<PB N="276" REF="024407_0280_0FC7068F1E496B00"/>
bottom of the index H by a like moveable joint; GH is the index turning on its centre I, and tra∣velling over the graduated arch K; and L is a strong spring, bearing against the rod AB, and constantly counteracting the pressure upon the pa∣late D. The rod AB should be applied close to one side of the cut-water or stem, and should be of such a length that the palate D may be no higher above the keel than is necessary to secure it from injury when the vessel sails in shoal water, or is aground. As the bow of the ship curves inward toward the keel M, the palate D will be thrown to a distance from the bottom of the ship, although the perpendicular rod to which it is ri∣vetted lies close to the bow above, and therefore it will be more fairly acted upon. The arm E should enter the bow somewhere near the hawser-hole, and lead to any convenient place in the forecastle, where a smooth board or plate may be fixed, hav∣ing the index H, and the graduated arch K, upon it.</P>
<P>IT is evident from the figure, that as the ship is urged forward by the wind, the palate D will be pressed against the water with a greater or less force, according to the progressive motion of the ship; and this will operate upon the levers, so as to immediately affect the index; making the least encrease or diminution of the ship's way visible
<PB N="277" REF="024407_0281_0FC7069A9326D8E8"/>
on the graduated arch. The spring L always counteracting the pressure upon the palate, and bringing back the index on any relaxation of the force impressed.</P>
<P>A ship going through the sea opens a passage for herself, making a hole in the water equal to her imerged bulk. As she passes on, this vacancy is filled up by the tumbling in of the water from each side, and at the stern with great violence; so that there is a strong current of water from her bow to her stern, passing under the bottom and at the sides of the ship; and the force of this current is in direct proportion to the velocity of her pro∣gressive motion. This machine is therefore ad∣vantageously placed at the bow of the ship, where the current first begins, and acts fairly on the pa∣late, in preference to the stern, where the tumul∣tuous closing of the waters causes a wake visible to a great distance. The palate D is sunk nearly as low as the keel, that it may not be affected by the heaping up of the water, and the dashing of the waves at or near the water-line. The arch K is to ascertain how many knots or miles she would run in one hour, at her then rate of sailing: but the graduations on this arch must not be equal; be∣cause the resistance of the spring L will encrease as it becomes more bent; so that the index will tra∣vel
<PB N="278" REF="024407_0282_0FC7069DA0820968"/>
over a greater space, from one to five miles, (which I suppose to be a medium) than from five to twelve. Lastly, the palate, rod, spring, and all the metallic parts of the instrument should be covered with a strong varnish to prevent rust from the corrosive quality of salt-water and sea-air.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="improvement">
<HEAD>IMPROVEMENT OF THIS MACHINE.</HEAD>
<P>LET the rod or spear AB, fig. 1. be a round rod of iron or steel; and instead of moving on the fulcrum or joint, as at C, let it pass through and turn freely in a socket, to which socket the moveable joint must be annexed, as represented in fig. 2. The rod must have a shoulder to rest on the upper edge of the socket and prevent it from slipping down. The rod must also pass through a like socket at F, fig. 1. The joint of the lower socket must be fixed to the bow of the ship, and the upper socket must be connected with the hori∣zontal arm E. On the top of the uppermost socket let there be a small circular plate, bearing the 32 points of the mariner's compass, and let the top of the rod AB come through the center of this plate, so as to carry a small index upon it, as re∣presented in fig. 3. This small index must be fix∣ed to the top of the rod on a square: so that by
<PB N="279" REF="024407_0283_0FC706A039730800"/>
turning the index round the plate, the rod may also turn in the sockets, and of course carry the plate D round with it, the little index always pointing in the direction of the face of the palate. The small compass-plate should not be fastened to the top of the socket, but only fitted tight on, that it may be moved at pleasure.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE then, the intended port to bear south-west from the place of departure, the plate must be turned on the socket till the south west point thereon points directly to the ship's bow, so that the S. W. and N. E. line on the compass-plate maybe precisely parallel with the ship's keel: and in this position the plate must remain during the voyage. Suppose then the ship to be sailing in the direct course of her intended voyage, with her bow sprit pointing S. W. let the little index be brought to the S. W. point on the compass-plate, and the palate D will necessarily present its broad face towards the port of destination: and this it must always be made to do, be the ship's sailing course what it may. If, on account of unfavourable winds, the ship is obliged to deviate from her intended course, the little index must be moved so many points from the S. W. line of the compass-plate, as the compass in the binnacle shall shew that she deviates from her true course. So that, in whatever direction the
<PB N="280" REF="024407_0284_0FC706A1269F2D30"/>
ship shall sail, the palate D will always look full to the S. W. point of the horizon, or towards the port of destination; and, consequently will present only an oblique surface to the resisting me∣dium—more or less oblique as the ship deviates more or less from the true course of her voyage. As, therefore, the resistance of the water will ope∣rate less upon the palate in an oblique than in a direct position, in proportion to its obliquity, the index H will not shew how many knots the vessel runs in her then course; but will (it is expected) indicate only how many she gains in the direct line of her intended voyage. Thus, in fig. 5. if the ship's true line of her intended course is AB, but she can sail by the wind no nearer than AC: suppose then her progressive motion such as to per∣form AC, equal to 5 knots, yet on account of the obliquity of the palate D, the index H will on∣ly point to 4 on the graduated arch, shewing that she gains no more on the true line of her voyage, viz. from A to B. Thus will the difference between her real motion and that pointed out by the index, be always in proportion to her devia∣tion from the port of destination, until she sails in a line at right angles therewith, as AD; in which case the palate would present only a thin sharp edge to the resisting medium, the pressure of which should not be sufficient to overcome the bearing
<PB N="281" REF="024407_0285_0FC706A2B47BC2B0"/>
of the spring L, and the friction of the machine. So that at whatever rate the ship may sail upon that line, the index will not be affected, but point to O, shewing that she gains nothing on her true course. For in this case, and also when the vessel is not under way, the action of the spring L should cause the index to point to O; as re∣presented by the dotted lines in fig. 1. and 4.</P>
<P>AS the truth of this instrument must depend up∣on the equal pressure of the water against the pa∣late D according to the ship's velocity, and the pro∣portionable action of the spring L, there should be a pin or screw at the joints C and F, so that the rod may be readily unshipped and taken in, in order to clean the palate from any foulness it may con∣tract, which would greatly encrease its operation on the index H, and thereby render the graduated arch false or uncertain.</P>
<P>FURTHER, the spring L may be exposed too much to injury from the weather and salt-water if fixed on the outside of the ship's bow. To re∣medy this, it may be brought under cover by constructing the machine as represented by fig. 4: where AB is the rod, C the fulcrum or centre of its motion, D the palate, E the horizontal arm leading through a small hole into the forecastle, M
<PB N="282" REF="024407_0286_0FC706A4461DDB60"/>
is a strong chain, fastened by one end to the arm E, and by the other to a rim or barrel on the wheel G, which by means of its teeth gives mo∣tion to the semicircle I and index H. The spring L is spiral, and enclosed in a box like the main spring of a watch: A small chain is fixed to, and passing round the barrel, is fastened by the other end to the fuzee W; this fuzee is connected by its teeth with the wheel G, and counteracts the motion of the palate D; NN are the two sockets through which the rod AB passes, and in which it may be turned round by means of the little in∣dex R; S is the small compass-plate moveable on the top of the upper socket N. The plate S hath an upright rim round its edge, cut into teeth or notches, so that when the index R is a little raised up, in order to bring it round to any point, it may fall into one of these notches and be detained there: otherwise the pressure of the water will force the palate D from its oblique position, and turn the rod and index round to the direction in which the ship shall be then sailing.</P>
<P>SHOULD it be apprehended that the palate D being placed so far forward, may affect the ship's steerage, or obstruct her sailing, it should be consi∣dered that a very small plate will be sufficient to work the machine. I should suppose that one of
<PB N="283" REF="024407_0287_0FC706AD242A83B0"/>
three or four inches diameter, or less, might be suf∣ficient for the purpose.</P>
<P>THE greatest difficulty, perhaps, will be in gra∣duating the arch K (if the machine is constructed as in fig 1.) the unequal divisions of which can only be ascertained by actual experiment on board of each ship respectively; in as much as the truth of these graduations will depend on three circum∣stances, viz. The position of the fulcrum C, with respect to the length of the rod, the size of the palate D, and the strength of the spring L. When these graduations, however, are once ascertain∣ed for any one vessel, they will not require any future alteration, provided the palate D be kept clean, and the spring L retains its elasticity.</P>
<P>BUT the unequal divisions of the graduated arch will be unnecessary if the instrument be made as at fig. 4. For as the chain goes round the bar∣rel L, and then winds through the spiral channel of the fuzee W, the force of the enclosed spring will operate equally, or nearly so, in all positions of the index, and consequently the divisions on the arch K may in such case be equal.</P>
<P>AFTER all, it is not expected that a ship's lon∣gitude may be certainly determined by this in∣strument.
<PB N="284" REF="024407_0288_0FC706AE4ADF66C8"/>
The irregular motions and impulses to which a ship is continually exposed, make such an accuracy unattainable by any machinery; but if it should be found, as I flatter myself it will, on fair experiment, that it answers the purpose much bet∣ter than the common log, it may be considered as an acquisition to navigation.</P>
<P>IT should be observed that in ascertaining a ship's longitude by a time piece, this great inconvenience occurs, that a small and trifling mi∣stake in the time will make a very great and dan∣gerous error in the distance, run, or longitude; whereas the errors of this instrument will operate no further than their real amount, which can never be great or dangerous, if corrected by the usual observations made by mariners for correcting the common log.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An ingenious mechanic would probably construct this machine to better advantage in many respects. The author only meant to suggest the principle, experiment alone can point out the best me∣thod of applying it. He is sensible of at least one defect, viz. that the little index R, fig. 4. will not be strong enough to retain the palate D in an oblique position when a ship is sailing by the wind; more especially as the compass-plate S, in whose notched <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im the index R is to fall, is not fixed to, but only fitted tight on the socket N; some means, however, might be contrived to remedy this in∣convenience.</NOTE></P>

<P><PB N="285" REF="024407_0290_0FC706B19DED7FC0"/>A like machine made in its simple form, (as at fig. 1.) so constructed as to ship and unship, might occasionally be applied along side, about mid-ships, in order to ascertain the lee-way. As to sea cur∣rents, this, and all other machines hitherto inven∣ted, must be subject to their influence: for these the usual allowances must be made, according to the skill of the navigator.</P>
<P>LASTLY. Some discretion will be necessary in taking observations from the instrument to be en∣tered on the log-book. The most favourable and equitable moment should be chosen for the obser∣vation. Not whilst the ship is rapidly descending the declivity of a wave, or is suddenly checked by a stroke of the sea, or is in the very act of plun∣ging. In all cases, I suppose, periods may be found, in which a ship proceeds with a true average velocity; to discover which, experience and at∣tention will lead the skilful mariner.</P>

<HEAD>AN IMPROVED METHOD OF QUILLING A <HI>HARPSICHORD.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE strings of a Harpsichord are made to vibrate by the impulse of small pieces of a crow-quill: these, from the manner in which they are applied, are compelled to perform their office to such disadvantage that many become weak and fail, with little use, and what is called <HI>the touch</HI> of the instrument, becomes thereby unequal and dis∣agreeable both to the performer and hearer; unless frequently repaired, which is one of the most troublesome and difficult operations in keep∣ing the instrument in order.</P>
<P>I attempted, two or three years ago, to re∣medy this imperfection. My first idea was to encrease the length of quill, that it might act more like a spring than it can do in the way
<PB N="287" REF="024407_0292_0FC706C56AE717E0"/>
it is now applied. I effected my purpose, by mount∣ing the quill in the manner represented by fig. 1. By this means the spring of the quill was advan∣tageously encreased without its horizontal length, which from the construction of the instrument can∣not be more than about 1-4<SUP>th</SUP> of a inch. AB fig. 1. is the tongue of the jack in profile, C is the quill fixed tight in a hole punched slanting downwards through the tongue according to the dotted line. The quill is then bent upwards and made to pass through an∣other hole D, punched through the upper part of the tongue, and then proceeds horizontally the ne∣cessary length. This last hole is made large e∣nough for the quill to have free play in it, so that the spring of the quill may be in the curve CD; which will not break or fail by any service it has to perform.</P>
<P>THIS contrivance seemed to answer very well; but it was objected, that the quill being thus forci∣bly bent, was apt to spring back, in some instances, so that not only the point of the quill became too short to reach the string it should strike, but the cur∣ved part would interfere with the string next behind it. And although, in the experiment, this inconve∣nience rarely occured, and was rather a fault in
<PB N="288" REF="024407_0293_0FC706C604A6A0C8"/>
the execution than in the design, yet the project was not adopted because of the uncertainty.</P>
<P>MY next device was to throw aside the quills altogether; and taking hard and well seasoned soal leather, I cut therefrom the intended <HI>tongues</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">What is commonly called the tongue, I shall now call <HI>the palate,</HI> and my substitute for the crow-quill I shall denominate the tongue.</NOTE> which I mounted on springs as in fig. 2. Where A is the palate seen in profile, having a mortoise cut through it for the reception of the leathern tongue B, which is moveable in the mortoise on a small pin; C is aback view of the same palate, showing the zig-zag spring by which the tongue is govern∣ned. The spring is of fine wire, and is fastened by one end to the root of the tongue, as at D, and by the other to a small staple at E.</P>
<P>THIS contrivance produced in effect an admi∣rable fulness of tone, and promised permanency, because the elasticity required is not in the tongue which gives the stroke, but in the wire spring, which, if properly annealed will not be likely to fail.</P>
<P>THE objection was, that the touch was not so lively and agreeable as that of the common quill;
<PB N="289" REF="024407_0294_0FC706C7861E40F0"/>
but principally that the machinery was too complex and delicate for general use.</P>
<P>BOTH these methods are fully described in the second volume of the transactions of the American philosophical society of Philadelphia.</P>
<P>ENCOURAGED by at least a partial success, I again endeavoured to attain the object I had in view, and flatter myself that I have now fully succeeded.</P>
<P>THE desideratum is, a substance to supply the place of the crow-quill, sufficiently elastic for the purpose, which shall afford an easy and brilliant touch, shall draw a full and pure tone from the string, be applied with as much simplicity as the common quill, and be permanent in itself.</P>
<P>AFTER fair experiment and long trial, the fol∣lowing method of <HI>tongueing</HI> a harpsichord hath been found to answer all the above requisites.</P>
<P>I took what is <HI>called velvet-cork,</HI> of the best kind, free from dolts, cracks or blemishes. I cut this cork into plates, about one quarter of an inch thick, and glued upon them thin and well polished leather; from these plates I cut the tongues, and
<PB N="290" REF="024407_0295_0FC702C6280CBB38"/>
pressed them tight into mortoises cut for the purpose through the palates, in the same manner, and with the same ease that the common quill is fixed in the little hole punched for its reception. The cork must then be shaved off underneath, slanting from the point, where it must be very thin, to the face of the palate, and then nibbed like a pen to the pro∣per length. The touch may afterwards be nicely regulated by shaving away more of the cork from underneath, if requisite, with a sharp pen-knife or a fine file.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="remarks">
<HEAD>REMARKS.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. THE <HI>cork</HI> (as before observed) must be of the kind called <HI>velvet-cork,</HI> of an elastic substance, and free from imperfections of every kind.</P>
<P N="2">II. THE <HI>Leather</HI> should be thin, well stretched, and of a polished surface—That which I used was stripped from the cover of a bound book, which answered very well, after I had scraped and well washed its under surface.</P>
<P N="3">III. THE <HI>paste or glue.</HI> In my first experiment I made common glue pretty thin, and with this I glued the leather on the cork; but found after∣wards, that in very dry and frosty weather, the
<PB N="291" REF="024407_0296_0FC702C7AC9A7500"/>
touch became harsh and disagreeable, because glue in such weather becomes as hard as horn. I then dissolved a little Isinglass, or fish glue, in hot water, and with the addition of some flour I made a moderately thin paste; and with this I pasted the leather upon the cork, putting the plates under a press till dry: and I found it to answer well.</P>
<P N="4">IV. IN cutting the tongues from these plates of cork faced with leather, care must be taken that the grain of the cork shall run lengthwise from end to end, and not a cross the tongue. The rea∣son is plain.</P>
<P>I have found these tongues to answer every requi∣site. The cork is sufficiently elastic for the service it is to perform, and affords a lively and pleasant touch. The polished leather presents a most agree∣able surface of contact with the metal string, and shields the cork, which would be soon cut through by the string. The tone produced is full, and ve∣ry pure, being perfectly free from that <HI>clicking</HI> noise which the strokes of a quill unavoidably produce, and which has been justly complained of in the best harpsichords. And lastly, the tongue thus made will be durable, I may judge if from the experience of eighteen months and al∣most daily use, very few having failed in that
<PB N="292" REF="024407_0297_0FC702D169BF0EB8"/>
time, and those only where there was some imper∣fection in the cork, or the grain lay across the tongue. But when this happens, nothing is easier than to cut and shape a new tongue from the plate of cork and leather, which may be fitted to the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtoise and adjusted in as little time as a common quill, and with as little trouble, Harpsichords, quilled in the usual way, may be furnished in the manner now recommended, by dismounting the pa∣lates and cutting mortoises of a proper size; the little hole in which the quill had been fixed serving for the upper limit of the mortoise in which the cork tongue is to be fitted.</P>

<HEAD>DESCRIPTION OF A CANDLE-CASE.</HEAD>
<P>THE design of this machine is to screen the flame of a candle from being flaired by the wind in summer, or drawn by the current of air to∣wards the chimney in winter.</P>
<P>THE flame of a candle is at all times much agi∣tated by the air. Every person must have ob∣served, in reading or writing by candle light, that the light will sometimes acquire a rapid, vibratory motion, which occasions the letters on the book or paper to appear and disappear in quick succession. This twinkling is so painful to the eye, that the person is frequently obliged to look from the book or paper for a moment, or to stroke his eyes with his hand. The sensation is very disagreeable; and no wonder, when it is considered, that the iris of the eye contracts and dilates in correspondence with every moti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the flame.</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="024407_0299_0FC702D46D297E30"/>THE machine I have contrived will shield the flame from the undulations of the air, and cause it to burn with a steady and uniform light, Fig. 1. represents this machine fastened by screws to a common candlestick. A, the candlestick; B B, two semicircular plates of brass which embrace the top of the candlestick; these are furnished with cheeks on each side, which are drawn close together by means of the screws,C C; and thereby the machine is firmly fixed to the candlestick, and may be removed at pleasure by taking out the screws. (See the semicircular plates represented separate at fig. 2.) One of these plates has an arm, D, connected with a crotchet E E. In the two ends of this crotchet there are square holes, for the reception of the long square wire F. This square wire slips easily up and down through the square holes; and that it may stand supported in all positions, and slide with an uniform friction, there is a small piece of watch-spring, G, rivetted to the middle of the crotchet, and pressing with its two ends against the square wire. H is an arm fixed to the long wire, bearing a small ring, I; this ring is a little larger than a common candle, and its use is to keep the candle upright, and pre∣vent its falling against the glass, hereafter men∣tioned, if it should be too loose in the socket, or not set perpendicular in the candlestick. K is ano∣ther
<PB N="295" REF="024407_0300_0FC702DE6C6BDB50"/>
arm fixed on the top of the long wire, and carrying another ring, L, larger than the one just mentioned. This ring is for the reception and support of the glass, M, which surrounds the flame of the candle, and causes it to burn with a steady light. The glass, M, is one of those used for the new patent lamps: it is a tube, open at both ends, of 2 ½ inches diameter, and about 4 inches long, and has a rim round the top, by which it hangs on the ring, L. As the candle wastes, the glass must be slipped down by means of the knob, N; or if it should require to be snuffed, the glass may be raised or lowered so as to expose the wick for the purpose. Fig. 3 represents the machine detached from the candlestick, and without the glass. The same letters of reference are put to the corresponding parts with fig. 1.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>THIS contrivance fully answered the purpose intended, of keeping the flame steady and the light uniform; but an inconvenience occurred which was not expected. It occasioned the candle to <HI>gutter;</HI> that is, the melted wax or tallow would collect in an undue quantity round the bottom of the wick, and run down the sides of the candle. This was not owing to the heat of the glass, as I
<PB N="296" REF="024407_0301_0FC702DFAFCFF1C8"/>
at first imagined; for a strong current of air occa∣sioned by the flame, kept the glass so cool, that pieces of wax or tallow would adhere to it without melting, and the glass might be handled without inconvenience. I know not the reason of this, unless it be, that the inner circular surface of the glass concenters the heat to a focus in that place by reflection, or that the current of air bears up the flame, so that it does not consume the wax as fast as it melted. It was observable that the flame was considerably elongated, and that it did not follow the waste of the wax as close as common, but left an unusual portion of wick be∣tween it and the melted wax.</P>

<HEAD>FULL AND TRUE ACCOUNT OF A TERRIBLE UPROAR WHICH LATELY HAPPENED IN A VERY EMINENT FAMILY.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not long since the lady <HI>Pennsylva,</HI> a person of high distinction, and much esteemed for her wis∣dom, wealth, and importance, was, to the surprise of every one, delivered of fine boy. She was dotingly fond of this infant; and the more so as the tongue of slander had endeavoured to cast infamy on her and the child, by plainly calling her a whore and the boy a bastard. But it was well known to her intimate acquaintance that she had been pri∣vately married to <HI>Patriotism,</HI> a very worthy and honourable gentleman, who was indeed the father of the child. But <HI>Patriotism</HI> unfortunately died soon after the lady <HI>Pennsylva</HI> was brought-to-bed.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="024407_0304_0FC702F344FE6970"/>THE untimely death of the father greatly en∣deared the son to the disconsolate widow; and more especially, as the boy bore a striking likeness of her lost husband.</P>
<P>SHE called him <HI>Independence;</HI> she nursed him with care and attention, and endeavoured to pro∣cure such servants in her family as would feed and tend him, rather from motives of real affection than from mercenary views. But such disinterested persons were not easily found. Jealousies had al∣ready taken place. Some envied others for their stations and wages, and hatred and contempt in∣fected the family, till at last the jarring views and interests of the servants broke out into an open rupture—The case was this—</P>
<P>THE lady <HI>Pennsylva</HI> had hired a wet-nurse for her child—her name was <HI>Reedina</HI>—and no one doubted but that she had a sincere affection for the baby. Nevertheless, she had but an uneasy time of it. Having not the best temper in the world, she not only had many quarrels of her own upon hand, but she took part also in those of the other servants; in which she did not exercise upon <HI>all</HI> occasions an impartiality becoming the station she filled in the family. In short, she suffered her∣self to be influenced by those who were not her
<PB N="299" REF="024407_0305_0FC702F6EB506CB8"/>
equals in abilities; and who made use of her power and influence to gratify their own ambitious views.</P>
<P>IN due course of time, <HI>Reedina's</HI> milk dried a∣way,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By the constitution of Pennsylvania, a new president must be elected every three years.</NOTE> and it became necessary to get another nurse for the infant.</P>
<P><HI>REEDINA,</HI> though necessarily removed from her station, was not willing to resign her sway in the family; but wishing to have it still in her power to shew favour to those whose party she had espoused, and to punish those who had been too free in their strictures on her conduct, she found out one ma∣dam <HI>Potterini,</HI> and strongly recommended her as a fit person to supply her place.</P>
<P>MADAM <HI>Potterini</HI> was a very good sort of wo∣man, and truly attached to young <HI>Independence;</HI> but then she was altogether unskilful in the affairs of a nursery. She knew not how to dress the ba∣by with propriety; and in case of teething, lax, belly-ach, or other disorders incident to the tender state of infancy, she was ignorant of the treatment proper on such occasions; having never had the opportunity of acquiring that kind of knowledge.
<PB N="300" REF="024407_0306_0FC702FACFC87760"/>
<HI>Reedina,</HI> nevertheless, recommended her in the strongest terms as a suitable nurse for the child, and got all those servants who were in her interest to join in the recommendation; not that she thought madam <HI>Potterini</HI> equal to the task, for she well knew to the contrary: but expected that <HI>Potteri∣ni's</HI> ignorance in the business of a nursery would render her dependent upon her for advice in all things, so that she in fact might govern the family as heretofore, although out of place.</P>
<P>THOSE who hated <HI>Reedina,</HI> saw through this design, and opposed a Mrs. <HI>Richardson</HI> to madam <HI>Potterini,</HI> as a person better qualified to do honour to the station.</P>
<P>NO sooner was this rivalship known, but <HI>Reedina's</HI> party became outrageous—every thing that calum∣ny could invent, or malice insinuate, was poured forth against Mrs. <HI>Richardson,</HI> and high panegyrics wrought up in favour of madam <HI>Potterini.</HI> These were all answered with equal malignity by the partizans of the other side against <HI>Reedina</HI> and her adherents. Nothing but railing and reviling was heard in the house—abuse was answered by abuse, and slander ballanced by slander.</P>
<P>AT length the good lady <HI>Pennsylva,</HI> hoping to
<PB N="301" REF="024407_0307_0FC702FE5CA24AB0"/>
put an end to these disgraceful altercations, made her election, and committed the care of her son, and the superintendency of her family to Mrs. <HI>Richardson.</HI> But this determination had not the desired effect: scolding, lying, and abuse were car∣ried to greater heights than ever; the servants were all formed into parties, and the peace of the family was entirely broken up.</P>
<P>NOW the principal partizans had arranged them∣selves in the following order:</P>
<P>ON one side, was Mrs. <HI>Richardson,</HI> the wet nurse: to her adhered <HI>Kitty Oswald,</HI> one of the chamber-maids; miss <HI>Jackson,</HI> the seemstress; <HI>Peggy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> the cook; her brother <HI>Jacob,</HI> the clerk; <HI>Tom Fallon,</HI> the scullion, with many others.</P>
<P>ON the side of the malecontents, appeared <HI>Ree∣dina,</HI> the late nurse; <HI>Thomas,</HI> the chief steward; <HI>George,</HI> the under steward; <HI>Fanny Belly,</HI> the second chamber-maid; cock-eyed <HI>Moll</HI> and <HI>Doll Frow∣sey,</HI> her understrappers; together with <HI>Jonathan,</HI> the late coachman; <HI>Wilkins,</HI> the footman; <HI>Henry,</HI> the lick-spit, and several more.</P>
<P>THESE persons, however, opposed to each other, equally professed a warm attachment to
<PB N="302" REF="024407_0308_0FC702FF36417720"/>
young <HI>Independence,</HI> and to the interests of the fa∣mily; but neither side would allow that the other had any sincerity in these professions. They mu∣tually charged each other with disaffection, and terms of obloquy and reproach were dealt about without the least regard to common decency.</P>
<P>THEIR disputes and animosities were at length wrought up to such a pitch of rancour and inveteracy as to break out in actual warfare:— but all things in order—Before a poor mortal un∣dertakes a task so arduous, he should, out of decen∣cy and in compliance to ancient custom, invoke supernatural help: and, if he should have creduli∣ty enough to believe that assistance hath been grant∣ed, and even fancy that he feels himself inspired, there is no doubt but he will perform his task with a vigour and spirit proportionable to the strength of his faith.</P>
<P>COME then, thou heavenly muse! who hast as∣sisted in describing the bloody frays of wrangling mortals, from the famous siege of Troy in ancient times, to the more famous siege of York-town in Virginia, of recent date! Or, if there should be two of your divinityships, one more skilled in the mortal contests of the field, and the other bet∣ter versed in private broils and warfare of the fist

and tongue—even thou, who heretofore didst guide the pen of <HI>Butler,</HI> when he sang the frays of <HI>Hudibras,</HI> with rabble rout—thou, who didst thy aid afford when <HI>Fielding,</HI> in exalted prose, describ∣ed the valorous feats of <HI>Molly Seagrim,</HI> in the field of death, or Mrs. <HI>Partridge,</HI> in domestic strife—refuse me not thy help! but teach me how to scold!—Alas! my invocation is in vain—the goddess hears me not—I must therefore try what mere mortal strength can do; and with no other help or inspiration, but what <HI>Kitty Oswald</HI> and <HI>Fanny Belly</HI> can afford, must venture to proceed.</P>
<P>IT was on a Friday morning—a day of the week branded with ill fortune from the earliest times; the lady <HI>Pennsylva</HI> had gone abroad on some occa∣sion or other. <HI>Kitty</HI> and <HI>Fanny,</HI> the two chamber-maids, were about their ordinary occupation, when <HI>Kitty's</HI> brush, in sweeping the room, happened to strike against <HI>Fanny's</HI> heel, as she was making up the bed: whereupon the following dialogue en∣sued.</P>

other people, please to look at home at your own troop of trumpery.</Q></P>
<P><Q>SINCE you come to that, madam <HI>Trollop,</HI> (an∣swered <HI>Kitty,</HI>) I can soon be even with you.— Did not <HI>George,</HI> the steward, and <HI>Jonathan,</HI> the coachman, your great patrons and friends, cabal and rail against general <HI>Worthy,</HI> our master <HI>Pa∣triotism's</HI> chief friend, and now his executor? and did not he say he ought to be turned out of the house? for which <HI>Jonathan</HI> got a good flogging with his own horse-whip! and, more∣over, did not nurse <HI>Reedina</HI> treat with a villain about poisoning young master soon after he was born?—yes, she did—and <HI>Peggy Rush</HI> knows, or at least says she knows, that <HI>Reedina</HI> would strangle him this moment if she could.</Q></P>
<P>THERE is such an intimate sympathy between the tongue and the hands, that when the former is in full exercise, the latter cannot long remain inac∣tive: for words like trumpets are but preludes to battle. <HI>Fanny</HI> replied only by spitting full in <HI>Kit∣ty</HI>'s face: and so to fisty-cuffs they went without further ceremony, and with as keen an appetite as ever Dr. ***** sat down to a turtle feast.</P>
<P>AS a dog, which hath not only a natural hatred,
<PB N="307" REF="024407_0313_0FC7030F32A0F7D0"/>
but a contempt for the cat, (who, though the weaker animal, excels in cunning and malice,) should puss presume to lift her paw against him, sei∣zes and shakes her until his mouth is filled with hair, the spoils of the enemy: just so the enraged <HI>Kitty</HI> fell furiously upon poor miss <HI>Belly,</HI> and tore from her head, not only her gauze cap, but a handful of those ornaments, in which, like Sampson's, her chief strength lay: for <HI>Fanny</HI> was proud of her locks, as they were very pliable, and would set any way her admirers chose they should: she, however, like gri∣malkin aforesaid, flew upon her adversary, and in a moment imprinted <HI>eight</HI> lines of vengeance on <HI>Kitty's</HI> cheeks, which lamented the injury in tears of blood.</P>
<P>SOME authors have inadvertently mentioned <HI>ten</HI> marks of retaliation: but it should be observed that the thumbs seldom do execution on these occa∣sions. Be it as it may, this is certainly a very an∣cient method of wiping off <HI>old scores</HI> by making <HI>new ones.</HI></P>
<P>THE noise of this battle soon brought the family together. <HI>Kitty</HI> being <HI>Fanny's</HI> superior in strength, and finding her strength encreased by pain and rage, grasped her antagonist round the waist, lifted her from the floor, and in the presence of the whole
<PB N="308" REF="024407_0314_0FC7031C762A9B90"/>
houshold, turned up her coats, and spanked her right soundly with the dust-pan. <HI>Cock-eyed Moll</HI> and <HI>Doll Frowsey</HI> seeing their principal thus expos∣ed, and in the hands of the enemy, soused the con∣tents of two chamber-pots in <HI>Kitty's</HI> face.</P>
<P>THE company immediately arranged themselves according to their respective parties, and the battle became general. <HI>Peggy,</HI> the cook, emptied a hot dripping-pan on <HI>Reedina's</HI> head, whilst <HI>Jacob,</HI> the clerk, spattered her with a bottle of ink; <HI>Felon,</HI> the scullion, threw a quart of slush on <HI>George,</HI> the steward's old scarlet cloak; but <HI>George</HI> avoided fighting openly, and only slily pinched his adversa∣ries as opportunities offered; <HI>Reedina</HI> attacked nurse <HI>Richardson</HI> with a carving knife, with which she not only slashed her cloaths, but gave some ug∣ly wounds in the flesh: whilst Mrs. <HI>Richardson</HI> en∣deavoured to defend herself with a pillow snatched from the cradle. All was uproar and confusion, and in the tumult, the cradle was overset, and little <HI>Independence</HI> lay sprawling and bawling upon the floor, unnoticed and unpitied by the furious com∣batants.</P>
<P>IN the midst of the storm, up rose <HI>Thomas,</HI> the chief steward, and with great solemnity commanded silence in the name of the lady <HI>Pennsylva.</HI> Hosti∣lities
<PB N="309" REF="024407_0315_0FC7031EB20056B8"/>
being suspended, he called upon <HI>Kitty,</HI> and severely reprimanded her as being the author, or at least the encourager, of all this animosity: he reproached her as a virago, a common scold, and threatened to have her well ducked and turned out of doors: he emphatically rebuked her for abusing <HI>poor Fanny,</HI> the chamber-maid, and swore that she should answer for her conduct to her mistress.</P>
<P><HI>KITTY,</HI> who had spunk enough, could not bear this:—<Q>Yes, Mr. <HI>Thomas,</HI> (said she,) you may well stand up for <HI>poor Fanny the chamber-maid,</HI> as you call her, and good reason why, truly, for all the house knows she is your whore. How long is it, pray, since she brought forth a bastard in the shape of a law-book?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The new edition of the laws of Pennsylvania.</NOTE> Its features are too like its precious father to be mistaken: you are a fit person, truly, to preach up order and decency—you, who have secretly encouraged your trollop in all her provoking insolence, and scandalous lies. <HI>Fanny</HI> may say what she pleases— it is all proper—it is all right—she is a girl of spirit, and will make people know their places:—but, if I open my mouth, it is all calumny, slander, and breach of the peace—and what not. As to your threats, I scorn them; nature gave me a

tongue, and I will make use of it in spite of you or your pitiful whore—You silence me!—you duck me, and turn me out of doors!—I hope we are not come to that pass yet, that no one is to be allowed freedom of speech in this family, without your gracious licence: but I will ask my lady when she comes home, whether or no, she has thought proper to put the keys of our mouths into your pocket. I know you think yourself a very great man, Mr. <HI>Thomas</HI>—and you <HI>are</HI> a very great man, Mr. <HI>Thomas,</HI> to be sure; but for all that, I hope poor servants may perform the functions of nature without waiting for your permission—and so for the future, Mr. <HI>Thomas,</HI></Q>—Her tongue was running on at this rate, like the din of a brass candlestick tumb∣ling down stairs, when a thundering rap at the door announced the arrival of lady <HI>Pennsylva:</HI> hav∣ing heard of the terrible uproar in her family, from some of the neighbours, she had hurried home, and was no sooner admitted into the house, but she rushed to the scene of action.</P>
<P>THE first object that drew her attention, was the poor infant kicking and screaming under the cradle, which had been turned topsey-turvey over him. She took him up from the floor, and sooth∣ed him in her bosom with maternal tenderness:
<PB N="311" REF="024407_0317_0FC7032BC95AF560"/>
she then took a survey of the belligerent powers, as they stood before her, reeking hot with the fury of battle, and exclaimed with horror:—<Q>Heaven preserve me! what do I see? can these be the servants of my house? can these be the chosen few in whom I have placed so much confidence, and to whose nurture and care I have entrusted my darling child?—the hope of my family?— Go, miserable wretches; go, and cleanse your∣selves from filth, and repair your disordered dress; for I will not hold converse with you in your present tattered and bespattered conditi∣on: and see that you all meet me an hour hence in the great hall:—but first, <HI>Reedina,</HI> give up that carving knife; would you make a slaugh∣ter-house of my apartments?—oh, shame! shame!</Q>
Saying this, she hurried away to her chamber, oppressed with grief: and the comba∣tants silently stole off, some one way, some another, to prepare as well as they could, for the meeting in the great hall.</P>
<P>AT the appointed time, the lady <HI>Pennsylva</HI> re∣paired to the hall, and seating herself in an armed chair, with her little son in her lap, she rang the bell; a summons which soon brought all the house∣hold into her presence. After a few moments of
<PB N="312" REF="024407_0318_0FC7032DC488B4A0"/>
serious and expressive silence, she thus addressed them.</P>
<P><Q>WHERE is now that heroic ardour which once animated my friends in the defence of my righteous cause, against a cruel and powerful foe? Where is now that disinterested zeal—that divine enthusiasm, which once determined you to brave every extremity, in support of me and my infant son, when a cloud, black with ven∣geance, hung heavy over the fortunes of my house! Where is now that virtuous magnanimity, which, like a tower of strength, stood firm a∣gainst the most severe attacks?—But, why do I ask where? alas! I know too well, that they all lie buried in the sacred tomb of my departed lord.</Q></P>
<P><Q>YOU, for your abilities and supposed attach∣ment to me and mine, have been selected to be the special guardian of my honour and interests; but yon have most ungratefully exercised those abili∣ties in sowing discord in my family, and distracting my affairs. When you thus attack each other with all the rancour and malice of mutual enemies, you weaken my strength, and forward the views and wishes of those who seek the downfall of my house. Look at this darling infant, and con∣sider for a moment, how nearly his life is con∣nected
<PB N="313" REF="024407_0319_0FC7032F85135100"/>
with your conduct.—Would you wish to see him branded with infamy?—cast out, and torn by dogs?</Q>—Here the good lady shed tears in abundance.—<Q>I believe you would not—or do you wish to see him live, and grow to a state of manhood, and become a protector and a blessing to you and your's?—If so, for heaven's sake, cease these intestine broils—he lives in your uni∣on—he dies in your discord.</Q></P>
<P><Q>BUT should these base and vulgar quarrels be productive of no such serious consequences; they at least affect, nay, deeply wound, the reputation of my family. What must my friend the <HI>French</HI> nobleman think of us? What must the <HI>Dutch</HI> merchant next door, or the <HI>Spanish</HI> don over the way, think of us? Perhaps you care not— But, I ask, what do you think of yourselves? I appeal to your own consciences, whether in these inveterate altercations, you find your passions raised by a zeal for me, and a jealousy for my welfare, for this is what you all pretend—or, whether ambition, revenge, or avarice is not the true source of these animosities? It is easy to gild a foul design with a fair motive; but the touch-stone of adversity will expose the baser metal; and God only knows how soon your sincerity may be brought to the test. My heart
<PB N="314" REF="024407_0320_0FC70332F9CFE570"/>
is full and heavy; I shall not enlarge—I love you all; and my warmest wish is, that those whom I love, may love one another.</Q></P>
<P><Q>WHAT I had principally in view in ordering your attendance here, was to inform you, that my dear deceased husband hath directed by his will, that at the end of every seven months, pro∣per persons shall be appointed to enquire into the oeconomy of my family, and the conduct of my servants;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The council of censors.</NOTE> they are to be severe and impartial judges. The time of this enquiry is now near at hand; I shall, therefore, not investigate the oc∣casion and circumstances of this day's uproar; but resign you to those judges, who will not fail to punish the guilty, and rectify all abuses: in the mean time, however, I would earnestly and most pathetically recommend it to you, Mrs. <HI>Richardson,</HI> and to you, Mr. <HI>Thomas,</HI> to exert yourselves in preserving the peace of the family, by discouraging all acrimonious altercations, re∣conciling jarring interests, and distributing justice with moderation and impartiality.—Away! and leave me to the digestion of that sorrow, from which you alone can relieve me by your future harmony and good conduct.</Q></P>

<HEAD>A REMARKABLE HISTORICAL FACT, Mentioned in the records of the empire of <HI>CHINA,</HI> to be found in the great library of the royal city of <HI>PEKING,</HI> vol. <HI>3458</HI>: translated from the original, by an English gentleman who resided many years in that country, and now first published in the English language.</HEAD>
<P>IN the reign of HOANG-TI, who was co-tempo∣rary with Noah, a <HI>cacoethes,</HI> or malignant distem∣per, raged amongst the officers and servants of the emperor's court. The symptoms by which it ma∣manifested itself, were a most licentious delirium, and a virulent apathy, without any apparent cause of phrenzy, or visible diminution of health and strength: the infected violently attacked each other, and even strangers, if they crossed their way, by discharging, periodically, a black corrosive sali∣va, which always stained and sometimes infected those on whom it fell, to the great annoyance of the whole court.</P>
<P>WHEREUPON the great emperor HOANG-TI, ever careful for the good of his people, issued his
<PB N="317" REF="024407_0323_0FC70340D36C1F48"/>
royal mandate, commanding <HI>Cu-tan-sla-ash,</HI> his chief surgeon, and <HI>Pois-on-al,</HI> his chief physician, and <HI>Whim-sic-al,</HI> his chief metaphysician, to take the infected parties under their care; and after ex∣amining into the cause of this extraordinary disease, to apply the proper remedies, and then make re∣port to him of the whole matter.</P>
<P>IN pursuance of this mandate of the emperor HOANG-TI, many persons were apprehended, and carried to the grand infirmary. Amongst these were <HI>Chink-Chink,</HI> the poet, who was one of the royal council; <HI>Twing-Twang,</HI> the musician, who was also a mandarine; <HI>Fee-fa-fum,</HI> of the military; <HI>Quil-king-gum,</HI> the scribe; <HI>Rush-Tush,</HI> the politi∣cian; <HI>Tsang-hu,</HI> and <HI>Van-ho-ai,</HI> men of letters; with <HI>Fal-fool-fi-reb-rand, Van-hoc,</HI> and many others of inferior note.</P>
<P>AFTER <HI>Cu-tan-sla-ash,</HI> the surgeon, <HI>Poi-son-al,</HI> the physician, and <HI>Whim-sic-al,</HI> the metaphysician, had duly considered the case, they were unanimously of opinion, that this disease was occasioned by obstruc∣tions in the <HI>pori belarii, ductus hypaticus,</HI> and <HI>ductus pancreaticus:</HI> that in consequence of these obstruc∣tions, the bile not being duly elaborated by the liver, or sweetened and corrected by the pancrea∣tic juice, was extravasated into the abdomen, from
<PB N="318" REF="024407_0324_0FC7034A5F811FE0"/>
whence, ascending through the epigastric region into the thorax, it soon reached the salival glands, and so mixed with the chyle: that a great part was usually discharged through the mouth by spitting and sputtering; but the remainder being swallowed into the stomach, pervaded the whole circulation of digestion, and finally went off in foetid urine, or in a clammy and offensive sweat.</P>
<P>HAVING thus discovered the diagnostic symp∣toms, the curative indications readily presented, viz. to deterge the intestines by potent <HI>cathartics,</HI> to dislodge the obstructions by vigourous concussi∣ons, and to open a way for the virulent matter, by promoting sensible and insensible perspiration: and after much deliberation, it was concluded, that all these purposes might be affected by one simple ope∣ration, viz. THE BASTINADO; provided it should be administered to the patient <HI>usque ad sudorem &amp; putorem.</HI></P>
<P>AGREEABLY to this determination of <HI>Cu-tan-sla-ash,</HI> the surgeon, <HI>Pois-on-al,</HI> the physician, and <HI>Whim-sic-al,</HI> the metaphysician, the patients were forthwith bound hand and foot, and the operation administered with great alacrity.</P>
<P>THE effect was truly astonishing: some, indeed,
<PB N="319" REF="024407_0325_0FC7034E6C68E580"/>
required more, and others less, of the salutary ex∣ercise, according to the strength of the disease, and obstinacy of the patient: but in the end, all reco∣vered and were released; except only the unfortu∣nate <HI>Quil-king-gum,</HI> in whom the distemper was so inveterate, that he died under the operation, be∣fore any favourable symptoms appeared: this be∣ing the case, it was agreed between <HI>Cu-tan-sla-ash, Pois-on-al</HI> and <HI>Whim-sic-al,</HI> that the body of the de∣ceased should be opened, in order to a more certain discovery of the nature of this extraordinary disease.</P>
<P>THIS was accordingly done, and these learned men having made the investigation with great skill and attention, formed a report of the case, and laid the same before the emperor, in obedience to his royal mandate.</P>
<P>THE report was in these words.</P>
<P>"TO the great and mighty HOANG-TI, empe∣ror of CHINA, governor of the world, the inven∣tor of arts, and the father of his people:</P>
<P>"THE report of <HI>Cu-tan-sla-ash,</HI> his chief surge∣on; and of <HI>Pois-on-al,</HI> his chief physician, on in∣specting the body of <HI>Quil-king-gum,</HI> the scribe, deceased.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="024407_0326_0FC70351429C3680"/>"IN obedience to the royal command, we have attended to the cacoethical disease which had seized many persons belonging to your imperial court; and we are most happy in informing your majesty, that we have by proper applications restored all the patients that fell under our care, to composure, health and harmony, except the scribe <HI>Quil-king-gum,</HI> who, unfortunately expired under the opera∣tion necessary to his cure. This circumstance, however, hath afforded us an opportunity of dis∣covering, by occular testimony, the nature and seat of his disease.</P>
<P>"THE deductions from these facts we leave to the learned <HI>Whim-sic-al,</HI> your majesty's chief meta∣physician.</P>
<P>"WE have only to add, that in order to con∣firm the cure of those patients, whom we have been so fortunate as to restore, we have prepared emollient cataplasms of spices and aromatic herbs, to be applied to the breast, with a view to soften, sweeten, and correct any remaining malignity about the region of the heart."</P>

<P>"THE report of <HI>whim-sic-al,</HI> the metaphysician, on considering the case of <HI>Quil-king-gum,</HI> the scribe, as set forth in the report of <HI>Cu-tan-sla-ash,</HI> the surgeon, and <HI>Pois-on-al,</HI> the physician.</P>
<P>"YOUR majesty's chief surgeon and chief phy∣sician, having carefully and judiciously represented the remarkable circumstances, which occurred in opening the body of <HI>Quil-king-gum</HI> the scribe; it is my duty to explain to your majesty how this de∣rangement in the corporeal system became the ef∣ficient cause of that obliquity of conduct and acri∣mony of temper so conspicuous in the life and man∣ners of the deceased.</P>
<P>"EVER zealous to gratify the desires of my sovereign, it is with great concern I find myself under the necessity of praying your majesty's in∣dulgence in this particular, until I shall have com∣pleted a work which has been the attention and study of my whole life.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="024407_0328_0FC70355ABC78118"/>"THIS work which I shall have the honour of laying at the feet of the great <HI>Hoang-ti,</HI> will con∣tain a full and satisfactory account of the original elements of the spiritual and material kingdoms: It will trace the various phenomena that arise from the innumerable combinations of these elementary principles.</P>
<P>"I shall shew that in this visible world all things are but so many different exhibitions of one ori∣ginal essence; as the leaves, flowers, and fruit of a plant are only varied displays of the same nu∣tritious juice.</P>
<P>"I shall shew that fire is only condensed light, air is condensed fire, water condensed air; that earth is condensed water, and that metals, stones, and all the fossile kingdom are different modifica∣tions of condensed earth.</P>
<P>"SO also with regard to spirit; I shall con∣vince your majesty, and I hope, the whole world, that <HI>spirit</HI> or <HI>mind,</HI> abstracted from all adjuncts, is a simple essence or unity; not compounded of <HI>parts,</HI> but of <HI>powers</HI> only: That there can, there∣fore, be no original difference between <HI>souls;</HI> in∣asmuch as one <HI>unity</HI> cannot differ from another,
<PB N="323" REF="024407_0329_0FC70356FACE2B30"/>
except only in identity, and their powers being all <HI>essential</HI> must therefore be all equal.</P>
<P>"THAT to accomplish the inscrutable purposes of the great Creator, <HI>spirit</HI> became connected with, and inclosed in <HI>material</HI> organs: and being so incorporated cannot exhibit or exercise any of its powers, but such as the organization of the body with which it is connected is capable of making manifest.</P>
<P>"THAT, upon these principles, differences in temper and abilities are not occasioned by an ori∣ginal difference of <HI>souls,</HI> but are the consequences of a different organization of bodies. Inferring from this system, that the soul of an ideot, when disengaged from the faulty body with which it was united, hath all the powers and faculties of the soul of a philosopher. And, further, that the soul of an horse is as truly spiritual as the soul of a man.</P>
<P>"I shall have the honour also to shew, that, not∣withstanding this hypothesis, virtue and vice are not merely the effect of mechanism; but that the soul having an innate sense of right and wrong, and a power of controul over the body, can at plea∣sure, restrain or encourage its mechanical propen∣sities;
<PB N="324" REF="024407_0330_0FC7035D7025F550"/>
of which I shall give a variety of convinc∣ing examples. The body is the slave of an active soul, but may by inattention and indulgence be∣come the master. When the will of the soul is strong, it is in vain for the body to plead lassitude, weakness, or pain. Hence it is that the sailor braves contending elements, the soldier faces fire and sword, and the martyr smiles amidst sur∣rounding flames. For <HI>Volition</HI> is an essential qua∣lity of the soul, and however poorly it may exhi∣bit its <HI>powers,</HI> according to the circumstances of the material engine with which it is so intimately connected, it is always free <HI>to will.</HI></P>
<P>"IN this work I shall also explain to your ma∣jesty's comprehension all the mysteries of volun∣tary and involuntary motion; and trace the spirit from her first pantings in the <HI>punctum saliens,</HI> to the last struggles of animal life.</P>
<P>"YOUR majesty will then plainly see, that the character and conduct of the late <HI>Quil-king-gum</HI> was perfectly consonant with the frame and con∣stitution of his body, as represented by <HI>Cu-tan-sla-ash,</HI> your chief surgeon, and <HI>Pois-on-al,</HI> your chief physician; and you will know also how far he
<PB N="325" REF="024407_0331_0FC7035E66BFDC60"/>
might, and how far he could not, have counter∣acted the propensities of his mechanical nature.</P>
<P>"FOR the present, I can do no more than give a short abstract of deductions from his case.</P>
<P>"BUT the physical and metaphysical laws by which the temper of the soul becomes thus conso∣nant with certain arrangements and derangements of body, are so subtile, and so deeply involved in the great arcana of nature, that the most simple and common phaenomenon cannot be fully account∣ed for without developing the whole wonderful system.</P>
<P>"THUS when I shall explain to your majesty the cause by which a philosopher in a fever be∣comes a madman, and in a lethargy a fool, you will know all the mysteries of spirit and matter, separate or conjoined: you will fully comprehend the cause of waking, sleeping, and dreaming: you will see the source from whence the artist de∣rives his fancy, and the poet his fire.</P>
<P>"IN all these points I shall have the honour to give the great <HI>Hoang-ti</HI> full satisfaction, when I shall have completed the arduous work I have in hand.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="024407_0332_0FC70365CF801BF0"/>"IN the mean time, I pray your majesty to suspend that ardent thirst for knowledge which characterises your auspicious reign, and extend your royal indulgence to your faithful slave."</P>

<HEAD>SOME ACCOUNT OF A NEW WORK ENTITLED <HI>DIALOGUES</HI> OF THE <HI>DEAD.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS manuscript was not found in digging the vaults of the new Quaker meeting house in Arch Street; nor was it discovered in a leaden box by the labourers employed in the regulation of Seventh Street; neither was it washed out by a flood through the subterraneous aqueducts of the city into that place of general contribution <HI>the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck;</HI> but it was found, where it might natu∣rally be expected, in the pocket of the author.</P>

in good decent language. These were bold strokes in literature. But our author outstrips them far. That intelligent beings, under any form of exist∣ence, should be capable of a mutual communica∣tion of ideas, is not an absurd or improbable suppo∣sition. That the brute species, manifestly possessed of ideas and furnished with at least apparent or∣gans of speech, might maintain a friendly conversa∣tion is not difficult to conceive: but that dead carcases should utter sentiments, and hold recipro∣cal intercourse, seems to be a shocking violation of the bounds of probability. Our author, how∣ever, attempts to justify the ground he hath cho∣sen by a system of philosophy, whimsical enough, of which the principal outlines are these.</P>
<P>HE states the position, that whatever <HI>exists</HI> hath <HI>identity,</HI> or that which distinguishes it from another being however similar. That bodies are sensible of their <HI>identity,</HI> which is manifested by the resistance they make to any change of form, or to any diminution or addition of substance. That all material bodies have atmospheres adhering to their superficies, or rather that those atmospheres are the component parts of the bodies themselves, expanded and rarefied to an imperceptible degree of fineness. So that bodies have, in fact, no per∣ceptible out-lines. What appears to us, he says,

to be the external outlines of any body, is no∣thing more than that line of division in its atmo∣sphere which separates those particles which are gross enough to become the objects of vision, from those which are too refined for that purpose. And therefore, he infers, to no two men does the same object appear of equal magnitude, unless their eyes should be formed exactly alike, and pos∣sessed of precisely equal powers. From which he concludes, that no one can certainly say <HI>here</HI> this body <HI>is,</HI> but <HI>there</HI> it <HI>is not.</HI></P>
<P>HE asserts further, that these atmospheres, sur∣rounding not only the whole, but every molicule of a body, must ever prevent an actual contact of parts however closely pressed together; and there∣fore, there is not to be found in all nature a truly solid body. That when bodies lye so near each other that their atmospheres interfere, there must be an actual intercourse of parts between them, of which they are more or less sensible according to the vigour and activity of their respective atmo∣spheres. And that by such an interference of at∣mospheres, sentiments may be communicated, espe∣cially if the component parts of the effluviae have been highly sublimated.</P>

<SPEAKER>DOG.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know nothing of the street commis∣sioners—not I—I had got a bad cold, which oc∣casioned a defluxion from my nose. This was soon perceived. The cry of <HI>mad dog</HI> was raised, and the boys knocked me in the head—Street commissioners, indeed! I suppose if one of them should pass this way, he would soon order both you and me into a dirt cart, and pack us off to the commons.</P>

<P>I perceive that you are very ignorant. You seem to know nothing of the late improve∣ments in the police of this city. Don't you know that I lie here by express order of the street com∣missioners,
<PB N="331" REF="024407_0337_0FC70377B3C766D0"/>
those guardians of the health and con∣venience of the citizens of <HI>Philadelphia?</HI> and that these streets are regularly supplied with dead cats at a very considerable expence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOG.</SPEAKER>
<P>You surprise me very much!—Pray, to what purpose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will inform you. It has been discover∣ed, and proved, particularly by a <HI>Doctor Alex∣ander,</HI> professor in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> that filth, nasti∣ness, and corruption, are the only sure preservers of health. He made numberless experiments to ascertain this truth. He procured some of the li∣quor from a pool near Edinburgh, into which the carcases of dogs, cats, horses, &amp;c. and the general filth of the city are usually thrown. This he put into a glass, viscous, green, and frothy, as he found it: he took also some fair spring water and put it into another glass. Two pieces of fresh meat were suspended in these waters, and placed in the same degree of heat. In a few hours, the meat immersed in fair water began to smell offen∣sive, and soon after became putrescent; whilst the other remained sweet for several days; and, be∣ing broiled on the coals, made an excellent steak for the curious doctor to regale himself withal. Convinced by this experiment, our commissioners
<PB N="332" REF="024407_0338_0FC70378B3863368"/>
have directed as many carcases, and as much filth as can be collected, to be dispersed through the streets of this city. And it is owing to their attention that there is now no street or alley without at least a reasonable supply of putrescent matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOG.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! but I am sure there is a law for cleansing, pitching and paving the streets of this city, and a pretty heavy tax levied for the purpose. I am sure I have heard my master curse and swear bitterly whilst he paid it. Pray, what becomes of all that money?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAT.</SPEAKER>
<P>What becomes of it! The commissioners pay it away in premiums to boys who kill cats for the supply of this large city. Only consider—there are at this time not less than three hundred dead cats lying in our streets and alleys. But, alas! what is a poor cat?—not made of steel—she cannot last forever—continually run over by waggons laden with cord-wood—by drays, carts, coaches, and and chains, and perpetually kicked about by horses' hoofs. I suppose the oldest and toughest ram-cat that can be got will not wear more than a month. Well! three hundred cats per month make three thousand six hundred necessary for the an∣nual supply of this city—and these are not to be
<PB N="333" REF="024407_0339_0FC7038063064730"/>
had gratis. The time is not far off when the le∣gislature will find it necessary to pass a law for en∣couraging the breed of cats, and even allow a handsome bounty on their importation. Our worthy street commissioners already find cats so scarce, that they are sometimes obliged to put the city to an allowance. But they make up the defi∣ciency, by encouraging housekeepers to throw in∣to the streets, all the offals of their kitchens; such as guts, garbage, bones, feathers, oyster-shells, &amp;c. And they allow the soap-boiler to pile up before his door, the dregs of his trade— the stinking skimmings of putrid fat, and the <HI>ca∣put-mortuum</HI> of a whole winter's firing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOG.</SPEAKER>
<P>This system of police is entirely new to me, and I believe not generally understood. I have known many to curse the commissioners for the dirtiness of our streets, and pay with grudg∣ing a tax for which they say there is not value received.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mere effects of ignorance and prejudice! It is now known to the learned, that the volatile salts arising from putrescent substances are the most powerful antiseptics in nature. It must be owing to the extreme cleanliness of <HI>Constantinople</HI> that it is so often visited with the plague. For cleanli∣ness
<PB N="334" REF="024407_0340_0FC70381066FB098"/>
is part of the religion of a Mahometan—but Christians know better. The king of <HI>Spain</HI> once undertook to cleanse the streets of <HI>Madrid,</HI> by or∣dering the inhabitants to accommodate themselves with <HI>necessaries;</HI> but this had well nigh caused an insurrection in that great city. And the physi∣cians, one and all, joined in a remonstrance to the crown, declaring that the health of the inhabi∣tants depended upon there being a sufficient quan∣tity of human ordure spread over the streets of <HI>Madrid.</HI></P>
<P>MANY of the good people, who live on the east side of Front Street, between Arch and Vine Streets, hold the same philosophical creed. Who∣ever will stroll through that neighbourhood, from ten to twelve o'clock at night, (whether he goes along Front or Water Streets) will not fail to see the nymphs rush suddenly out, and pour forth plentiful libations to the goddess <HI>Cloacina</HI> from their sacred urns. And whoever walks that way early in the morning, might suppose that <HI>Jupiter,</HI> enamoured with the <HI>Danaes</HI> of that district, had again descended in a golden shower. Delicate constitutions, subject to nervous and hysterical af∣fections, are sure of finding relief by taking the air of that neighbourhood. And it is said the street commissioners frequently direct their morn∣ing
<PB N="335" REF="024407_0341_0FC70382669E6210"/>
walk that way to procure an appetite for breakfast. Moreover, it is expected, that as the season advances, the urinous salts will be so subli∣med by the heats of the summer sun, as to ge∣nerate a natural phosphorus: in which case that neighbourhood will apply for an exemption from the lamp-tax as an unnecessary imposition on that part of the city, whose inhabitants, like the fru∣gal fire-fly, can furnish light from their own tails.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DOG.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is this new doctrine of health the the only reason why our commissioners suffer the streets to remain in so nasty a condition?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAT.</SPEAKER>
<P>No—there are even pleasures and conve∣niences as well as real advantages arising from it. I shall only give you one instance. The streets being covered three or four inches thick with soft mud, and semi-fluid filth, the carriages pass easily and silently along, without disturbing the sick by the rattling of their wheels, or jarring the teeth out of the jaws of the riders, as is the case in driving over a clean stone pavement. Besides, a coach cannot run far without encountering the body of a cat: the wheels must unavoidably break three or four ribs of the carcase, and this will af∣ford an agreeable <HI>crash,</HI> to the great amusement of the ladies and gentlemen within.</P>

<P>Yes. That booby, who has gone whis∣tling along, little thinks how wonderfully the ma∣chine was constructed which he has so carelessly destroyed. If all the rational powers of his whole genealogy, from the first of his name, who was got behind a hedge in Ireland, to the last of of his family who will be hanged in America for a robbery, could be united in one individual, he would not be able to combine matter to such asto∣nishing effect, as it was arranged in the little casket he hath now crushed to pieces. Good God! what work he has made! Cerebrum, ce∣rebellum, pia mater, dura mater, pineal gland, medullary substance, nerves, lymph, venal and ar∣terial blood, ostium and peri-ostium, all confound∣ed together. Thanks, however, to bountiful na∣ture, who hath so ordered it, that no derangement of the machine, after what is called death, shall oc∣casion pain. But I was saying, from what you have observed, I begin to see things in a different light.</P>

<P>No matter; let me ask you—was there not an attempt made to have this city incorporated, with a view to its better government, and for the removal of what are called nuisances, abuses, and impositions?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Doubtless; provided the principal oppo∣ser be recommended as <HI>mayor</HI>; the next in vocife∣ration <HI>recorder;</HI> and the rest <HI>aldermen.</HI> For, depend upon it, this is a true republican maxim: "Power is a very dangerous weapon; yet if you will put it into my hands, I shall use it with so much lenity and discretion, as to make it a public bles∣sing: but no man else ought to be trusted."</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>CAT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only this: it is whispered that the street commissioners hold a monthly feast; at which the principal dish is two large ram-cats, smothered in onions. Numbers observed, or might have ob∣served, two skinned cats, lying in Chesnut-street, near Third-street: these had been prepared for this same love-feast: but as the gentlemen are ve∣ry nice in their eating, they were thought not fat enough for their table, and so were thrown into the common stock in the street, and a brace of better fed cats provided for the entertainment.</P>
<P>YOU grow impatient, or I meant to say some∣thing of <HI>the dock,</HI> that great ornament of our city: I could also give you a hint of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emarkable revo∣lution in politics, which is even now working its way, and will shortly shew itself—a revolution, which—</P>
<P>A carriage passing swiftly along at this instant, ran across the cat, and turned her fairly over; so that the side which had been next the ground was now uppermost, which circumstance totally chang∣ed the subject of conversation: for, as was before observed, this dialogue was maintained by an inter∣ference of atmospheres. Now, the volatile particles which had been for many days sweltering next the earth, were of a very different nature from those
<PB N="339" REF="024407_0345_0FC7039697E3A578"/>
which emanated from a surface exposed to the open air, and of course had a very different effect.</P>
<P>SOMETHING like this may be observed in ani∣mal life. If a man, when he goes to bed, indulges a train of thoughts, lying on his left side, when he turns on his right side, the whole train of ideas vanishes; and he can scarcely by any efforts of the mind, recover the same thread of cogitation, unless the subject was of a very interesting nature. So, in dreaming, a change of position in the body never fails to change the whole scenery in which the imagination had been engaged.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PROF.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because it hath never yet become a salt-box <HI>in fact,</HI> having never had any salt in it; and it may possibly be applied to some other use.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PROF.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true:—for a salt-box which never had, hath not now, and perhaps never may have, any salt in it, can only be termed a <HI>possible</HI> salt-box. What is a <HI>probable</HI> salt-box?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="342" REF="024407_0348_0FC7039DB5B37F60"/>
<SPEAKER>STU.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a salt-box in the hand of one going to a shop to buy salt, and who hath six-pence in his pocket to pay the grocer: and a <HI>positive</HI> salt-box is one which hath actually and <HI>bona fide</HI> got salt in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PROF.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very good:—but is there no instance of a <HI>positive</HI> salt-box which hath no salt in it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STU.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know of none.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PROF.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: there is one mentioned by some authors: it is where a box hath by long use been so impregnated with salt, that although all the salt hath been long since emptied out, it may yet be called a salt-box, with the same propriety that we say a salt herring, salt beef, &amp;c. And in this sense any box that may have accidentally, or otherwise, been long steeped in brine, may be termed <HI>positively</HI> a salt-box, although never designed for the purpose of keeping salt. But tell me, what other division of salt-boxes do you recollect?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STU.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are further divided into <HI>substantive</HI> and <HI>pendant</HI>: a <HI>substantive</HI> salt-box is that which stands by itself on the table or dresser; and a <HI>pen∣dant</HI> is that which hangs upon a nail against the wall.</P>

<P>What is the idea of a salt-box?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>It is that image which the mind conceives of a salt-box, when no salt-box is present.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PROF.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is the abstract idea of a salt-box?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STU.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is the idea of a salt-box, abstracted from the idea of a box, or of salt, or of a salt-box, or of a box of salt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PROF.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very right:—and by these means you acquire a most perfect knowledge of a salt-box: but tell me, is the idea of a salt-box a salt idea?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not unless the ideal box hath ideal salt in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PROF.</SPEAKER>
<P>True:—and therefore an abstract idea cannot be either salt or fresh; round or square; long or short: for a true abstract idea must be en∣tirely free of all adjuncts. And this shews the dif∣ference between a salt idea, and an idea of salt.— Is an aptitude to hold salt an <HI>essential</HI> or an <HI>acci∣dental</HI> property of a salt-box?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STU.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is <HI>essential;</HI> but if there should be a crack in the bottom of the box, the aptitude to
<PB N="344" REF="024407_0350_0FC703A72C724BC0"/>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PROF.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very good—Let us now consider one of the squares at the end of the salt-box. Suppose then a diagonal line to be drawn from one of the angles of this square to the opposite angle of the same, what will be the consequence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>It will divide the square into two equal and similar triangles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PROF.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true.—But can you demonstrate that these two equal and similar triangles are equal to each other?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STU.</SPEAKER>
<P>I draw the square ABCD, whose sides
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
are all equal, and the contained angles, all right angles. I then draw the diagonal BC, dividing the square into two equal parts. Then I say, that one of those equal parts,
<PB N="351" REF="024407_0357_0FC703CBE60EFB20"/>
viz. the triangle ABC is equal to the other equal part or triangle BCD; and further, that those two triangles are not only equal, but similar. For by the 105<SUP>th</SUP> proposition of the 49<SUP>th</SUP> book of <HI>Euclid,</HI> if in two triangles, all the lines and angles of the one, are equal to all the corresponding lines and angles of the other, those two triangles will be equal and similar. But the leg AB of the triangle ABC, is equal to the leg CD of the triangle BCD, be∣cause they are two of the sides of the square ABCD, equal by construction: and the leg AC is equal to the leg BD for the same reason; and because the hypothenuse BC is common to both triangles, therefore the hypothenuse of the tri∣angle ABC is equal to the hypothenuse of the triangle BCD. Now, because by the 115<SUP>th</SUP> pro∣position of the same book, equal legs subtend e∣qual angles of the same radii; it follows, that all the angles of the triangle ABC are equal to the corresponding angles of the triangle BDC: <HI>ergo,</HI> those two triangles are equal and similar: and <HI>ergo,</HI> if a square be cut by a diagonal line into two equal parts, those parts will be equal.

<HEAD>AN ADDRESS TO THE AMERICAN <HI>PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY.</HI> HELD AT PHILADELPHIA, FOR PROMOTING USEFUL KNOWLEDGE: (Delivered
<DATE>January 16, 17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>4.</DATE>)</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING observed, with real concern, the state of supineness and neglect into which this so∣ciety seems to have fallen, I cannot suppress the zeal that urges me to attempt something that may draw your attention to the important purposes for which the legislature hath incorporated you as a philosophical society, and to propose some regu∣gulations which may, in my opinion, prove benefi∣cial to this institution.</P>
<P><PB N="360" REF="024407_0366_0FC703F69BD8F7A0"/>PREVIOUS to the late war our society was ma∣king considerable progress towards becoming use∣ful and famous: it had already attracted the notice of learned men in Europe. The communica∣tions, by members at home and abroad were fre∣quent and valuable; so that in its infant state, it was enabled to publish a volume of transactions which stamped a credit on the society, and made it an object worthy of public encouragement.</P>
<P>THIS fair prospect, however, was totally over∣cast by the dreary tempest of war. The still voice of philosophy could not be heard amidst the hostile din of arms, the thunder of the cannon, and the horrible confusion of ravaged countries and plun∣dered cities.</P>
<P>BY the blessing of Almighty God, the prudent and heroic conduct of the citizens and soldiers of America, and the friendly assistance of a powerful ally, this war, which threatened so loudly, hath terminated in the establishment of our indepen∣dance, and a peace highly honourable and advan∣tageous to us.</P>
<P>IT is now time—it is high time—that philosophy should again lift up her head. Political sovereignty being thus secured to us, the eyes of Europe are
<PB N="361" REF="024407_0367_0FC70401350FC550"/>
turned towards America—And with what view? Not altogether to contemplate the peculiarities of our government. If our systems should be bad, we shall be the chief sufferers; if they are wise and good, we shall reap the chief advantage— foreign nations are not directly interested in this speculation. But they look towards us as a coun∣try that may be a great nursery of arts and scien∣ces—As a country affording an extensive field of improvement in agriculture, natural history, and other branches of useful knowledge. They look to those future philosophers, who shall search nature in her hidden recesses; in regions yet unexplored; in depths and caverns, which the light of day hath never yet illumined.</P>
<P>NO sooner were the glad tidings of peace an∣nounced, but many of the literati of Europe were hasty to encourage our pursuits by their friendly notice. The many letters, with presents of useful and curious books we have lately received, evince this.</P>
<P>IN what an interesting situation, then, are we placed? And in this interesting situation permit me to ask, what are we doing? I am truly sorry that the answer to this question should amount to little more than this—we are returning very civil
<PB N="362" REF="024407_0368_0FC70402DB1AE378"/>
acknowledgements for the letters and presents so received.</P>
<P>IT may, indeed, reasonably be supposed, that e∣very citizen of America must find himself intimately interested in the political concerns of his country; left in an unsettled state by the confusions of war; and deeply engaged in the arrangement and esta∣blishment of a new empire, to which the late im∣portant revolution hath given birth.</P>
<P>BUT these excuses, however substantial, cannot avail us long. If it shall be perceived, that year after year elapses, and nothing interesting is pro∣duced, no discoveries made, or even attempted to be made: when it shall be perceived, that our barrenness must be occasioned, either by a want of abilities, or which is, indeed, the truth, by a shameful want of attention, we must unavoidably sink into contempt: and when this shall be the case—I will venture to prophesy—<HI>this</HI> society will never regain its lost ground. Some other future philosophical society, better modelled, and compos∣ed of more zealous members, may rise into notice, and become useful: but this society will sink into oblivion.</P>
<P>I hope we are yet at a considerable distance
<PB N="363" REF="024407_0369_0FC7040678504A50"/>
from such disgrace; but as I apprehend we are rather verging towards it, my concern would not suffer me to withhold this warning.</P>
<P>To prove that my fears are not altogether with∣out foundation, I appeal to three notorious cir∣cumstances; our shameful neglect of the stated meetings of the society, the great scarcity of phi∣losophical communications, and the tenor and com∣plexion of our book of minutes.</P>
<P>NEVER was there an aera in which philosophi∣cal pursuits were more encouraged, or pushed with more success, than the present. The discoveries which have been made in every part of Europe, are most interesting and important. Some have contrived means to separate the different kinds of air, compounded in bodies, and to investigate and prove experimentally their respective properties: others have plunged, as it were, into the element of fire, to search out its subtle powers, and deve∣lope that great secret of nature, the generation of animal heat: some are pursuing electrical experi∣ments, with the most promising assiduity: others are adding new worlds to our system: and others, on principles hitherto undiscovered, send up the vast balloon, and float in regions deemed inaccessible to man.</P>
<P><PB N="364" REF="024407_0370_0FC704136B2C4AB8"/>THE door to knowledge seems to be wider open than ever it was: the authority of the schools is dai∣ly giving way to the authority of nature. It is now perceived, that it is not absolutely <HI>necessary</HI> that a man should be what is called <HI>learned</HI> in order to be a philosopher. A judicious and careful ex∣amination of the phenomena of nature, and ex∣periments, simple and easily made, may, and often do, lead the attentive enquirer to most important discoveries; even without any know∣ledge of what are called the learned langua∣ges, or of the systematical doctrines of the schools.</P>
<P>MANY, I am persuaded, have suppressed strong inclinations for experimental pursuits, from a notion than none can be a philosopher, or ought to meddle with philosophical enquiries, unless he has had what is generally called a <HI>learned education.</HI> The posi∣tion is not true in reason or in fact:—it is not true in fact; for, many of the greatest advances in philosophical knowledge have been made by men not eminent for their learning: and many of the most useful improvements in mechanics have been produced by men of the most scanty educa∣tion. That deservedly and universally admired philosopher the worthy president of this society,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Franklin.</NOTE>
<PB N="365" REF="024407_0371_0FC704156C37D300"/>
made some of his most important discoveries before he had acquired any considerable knowledge in school learning; for he had not a liberal educati∣on his youth. The position is not true in reason; for the language of nature is not written in Hebrew or Greek; the understanding thereof is not involv∣ed in the contemptible quirks of logic, nor wrapt in the visionary clouds of metaphysical hypothesis. The great book of nature is open to all—all may read therein—and who can read and understand, without worshipping the God of nature, who thus manifests himself in the simplicity and power of his works?</P>
<P>THE idolatrous veneration heretofore paid to the theoretical philosophy of those sages, who de∣rive half their reputation from the gross ignorance of the ages in which they lived, is now in a great measure done away: men begin, without fear of condemnation, to lay aside faith in philosophy, and bring doctrines to the test of fact. The impene∣trable mysteries and supernatural influences of chymistry have vanished with the smoke of the fur∣nace, and we see that chymical processes are gover∣ned by the unalterable mechanical laws of nature, which want nothing but fair investigation to be understood. The fatal fabric of systematical phy∣sic—that slaughter-house of one-fourth part of the
<PB N="366" REF="024407_0372_0FC7041709EDD6F0"/>
human species, is now falling to ruin. The mo∣dern physician simplifies his practice, by attending to nature and fact, and following their indications in preference to the dictates of <HI>Galen.</HI> In a word, men do not now, as heretofore, act peremptorily on what may appear to be reason; but reason cautiously on what appears to be fact: and this must surely be the right and safe road to the know∣ledge of truth.</P>
<P>WHAT a glorious aera for the advancement of true philosophy! The road to knowledge laid open, and the fashion of the times leading into it.</P>
<P>IN the midst of such advantageous circumstances, shall I again ask the mortifying question—What are we doing?—I avoid the answer—I would not offend—my design is only to rouse the society from that state of supineness and lethargy into which it seems to have fallen, and to stimulate its members to a more active attention.</P>
<P>OUR deficiency, I am confident, is not owing to a want of men of strong natural abilities, or a suffi∣ciency of acquired learning amongst us. Ameri∣ca hath been noted for the sagacity of her citizens. The very climate is favourable to the production of genius; and the uncultivated abilities of the
<PB N="367" REF="024407_0373_0FC704186ECF6600"/>
lowest class of the natives of this country, seem to be as keen and discerning as those of any country whatever. Our deficiency, then, must be owing merely to a want of attention, which, in our situa∣tion, is unpardonable.</P>
<P>BUT, as I have presumed to point at the evil, it is but a reasonable expectation that I should also attempt to suggest a remedy. This I will readily do according to my ideas of what may be benefi∣cial to the society.</P>
<P>IN the first place, I think it requisite that this corporation should have a building of its own, pro∣perly constructed for the accommodation of our library, natural curiosities, and philosophical appa∣ratus, with a convenient hall for the meetings of the society, public orations, lectures, &amp;c. To this building there should be annexed an observatory, a small chymical laboratory, and a botanical gar∣den. To accomplish so great a design, the situation of our treasury is certainly far inadequate. A mo∣derate revenue would serve all the purposes of the institution, if we were once provided with a build∣ing and apparatus; to effect which, I know of no way, but that of a general subscription, and an ap∣plication to the legislature for some assistance. This once accomplished, our annual income might be
<PB N="368" REF="024407_0374_0FC7042215156660"/>
augmented, by obliging every new member (ho∣norary members in distant countries excepted) to pay <HI>eight dollars</HI> for his certificate, and to sign an obligation to contribute <HI>twenty shillings</HI> per annum, to the support of the funds;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At this time new members paid nothing on their election, and the annual subscription was only ten shillings from the members, and that far from being punctually paid.</NOTE> and to be prohibited from voting, or being voted for to any office, unless all arrears be paid up: and if any member should refuse or neglect to pay his annual subscription for three years successively, it should be deemed a vo∣luntary withdrawing himself from the society, un∣less in case of absence from the country beyond sea, or other manifestly reasonable excuse.</P>
<P>I would propose, that in the election of counsel∣lors, particular respect should be had to choose such as would probably duly attend the stated meetings of the society; and that the counsellors so chosen, should understand, that however other members may be at liberty to attend or not, as inclination or convenience may permit, it will be expected of them, that <HI>they</HI> shall regularly assemble at the stated times for promoting the purposes of the institution; and, therefore, they shall be noticed by written or printed tickets, at least twelve hours before the time of meeting.</P>
<P><PB N="369" REF="024407_0375_0FC70423074AE5C8"/>THIS particular notice, however, should not imply the exclusion of any other member or mem∣bers, summoned only by public advertisement, who may choose to attend.</P>
<P>THE counsellors, besides the stated meetings, may hold meetings on their own adjournments, or may call themselves together, whenever it shall be thought necessary; but shall do nothing decisive concerning the society, in their own adjourned meetings, but only digest and plan mere matters of business, to be recommended and determined upon at the next stated meeting of the society.</P>
<P>MY object herein is, that all matters of business, being duly considered and prepared, the attention of the society may not be too much engaged in matters of little importance to philosophy; so that the conversations at the stated meetings, may be mostly employed in philosophical subjects with as little interruption as possible.</P>
<P>BUT above all, and as a principal object, I would recommend that at every stated meeting of the society, or at least as often as may be convenient, one or more philosophical experiments should ac∣tually be exhibited. The particular experiment to be determined upon at the preceding meeting, in
<PB N="370" REF="024407_0376_0FC70428D5D65118"/>
order that the curators, whose special duty it should be, may provide the requisites, and see that the necessary apparatus be in order for the purpose: and if any experiment be suggested by a member, it shall be performed at the expence of the treasury, provided a majority of members present when it is proposed shall so determine: and every experiment made, with the view in making it, and the final re∣sult should be fully recorded in a book to be kept for that purpose.</P>
<P>SUCH are the outlines of a reform, which I think would remedy the evils complained of—and for the following reasons:—first, as to the neglect in attending the meetings of the society. The exhibition of curious, and sometimes new experi∣ments, with the conversations and reasonings which such experiments would naturally occasion, must, I think, unavoidably engage the attention of many who now absent themselves for want of induce∣ments of entertainment or instruction. Secondly, the scarcity of philosophical communications: this would also probably be remedied, as the seeing experiments performed, and the possessing conve∣nient opportunities of bringing conceived truths to the test of fact, would incite and produce essays on many useful and curious points, which now live only in idea, and die in neglect. And, thirdly,

our book of minutes would shew that they record the proceedings of a philosophical society.</P>
<P>TO conclude, I wish this address may be consi∣dered as preparatory to a motion I shall now make —which is—</P>
<P>"THAT a committee may be appointed to take into consideration the constitution, laws, and regu∣lations of the society; and to propose such alte∣rations, amendments, and additions thereto, as they may think most likely to advance this society, and promote the good purposes for which it was insti∣tuted: and that the said committee propose the most promising means by which a building, and a complete philosophical apparatus, may be procu∣red; and report at the next meeting, or as soon as may be convenient."</P>

<HEAD>ACCOUNT OF A <HI>WORM</HI> IN A <HI>HORSE'S EYE.</HI> (Read in the Philosophical Society,
<DATE>Sept. 26, 1783.</DATE>)</HEAD>
<P>HAVING been myself a witness to the follow∣ing curious fact, I thought it should not pass un∣recorded, especially as it occured in this city, un∣der the immediate notice of the philosophical society.</P>
<P>A report prevailed last summer, that a horse was to be seen, which had a living serpent in one of his eyes. At first I disregarded this report; but several of my acquaintance, who had been to see the horse, confirming the account, I had the curi∣osity to go myself, taking a friend along with me.</P>
<P>THE horse was kept in Arch-street, and belonged to a free negro. I examined the eye with all the attention in my power, being no ways disposed to credit the common report, but rather expecting
<PB N="373" REF="024407_0379_0FC70438ABE41968"/>
to detect a fraud or vulgar prejudice; but was much surprised to see a real living worm within the ball of the horse's eye. This worm was of a clear white colour, in size and appearance much like a piece of white bobbin; it seemed to be from 2 ½ to 3 inches in length, which, however, could not be exactly ascertained, its whole length never appearing at one time, but only such a portion thereof as could be seen through the iris, which was greatly dilated. The creature was in a con∣stant, lively, vermicular motion, sometimes retiring so deep in the eye as not to be seen at all, and at other times approaching so near to the iris as to become plainly and distinctly seen; at least so much of it as was within the field of the iris. I could not distinguish its head, neither end being perfectly exhibited whilst I viewed it; and, indeed, its motion was so brisk and constant as not to ad∣mit of so nice an examination.</P>
<P>THE horse's eye was exceedingly inflamed, swoln, and running; I mean the muscles contigu∣ous to the eye-ball, and he seemed to be in great pain; so that it was with difficulty the eye could be kept open for more than a few seconds at a time: and I was obliged to watch favourable mo∣ments for a distinct view of this tormentor.</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="024407_0380_0FC7043A3948DB20"/>I believe the horse was quite blind in that eye, for it appeared as if all the humours were con∣founded together, and that the worm had the whole orb to range in; which, however, was not of a diameter sufficient for the worm to extend to its full length, as far as I could discover. The humours of the eye were beginning to grow opake, like a chilled jelly, and soon afterwards became al∣together so, as I was informed.</P>
<P>AS this is an uncommon circumstance, and may affect some philosophical doctrines, it is much to be lamented, that the horse had not been purchased, and the eye dissected for better examination.</P>
<P>THAT there was a living, self-moving worm in the ball of this horse's eye, free from all deception or mistake, I am most confident. How this worm got there, or (if bred in so remarkable a place) where its parents came from, or how they con∣trived to deposit their semen, or convey their egg into the eye of an horse, I leave for others to determine.</P>

<HEAD>AN OPTICAL PROBLEM, PROPOSED TO MR. <HI>RITTENHOUSE,</HI> AND SOLVED BY HIM.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Philadelphia,</HI>
<DATE><HI>March</HI> 16, 1785.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I TAKE liberty of requesting your attention to the following problem in <HI>optics.</HI> It is, I believe, entirely new, and the solution will afford amuse∣ment to you, and instruction to me.</P>
<P>SITTING at my door one evening last summer, I took a silk handkerchief from my pocket, and stretching a portion of it lightly between my two hands, I held it before my face, and viewed through the handkerchief one of the street lamps, which was about one hundred yards distant, expecting to see the threads of the handkerchief much magnified. Agreeably to my expectation, I observed the threads were magnified to the size of coarse wires; but was much surprised to find, that although I moved the handkerchief to the right and left before my eyes, the dark bars did not seem to move at all; but remained permanent
<PB N="376" REF="024407_0382_0FC7044207592638"/>
before the eye. If the dark bars were occasioned by the interposition of the magnified threads be∣tween the eye and the flame of the lamp, I sup∣posed that they would move and succeed each o∣ther as the threads were made to move and pass in succession before the eye; but the fact was o∣therwise.</P>
<P>TO account for this phenomenon, exceeds my skill in optics. You will be so good as to make the experiment; and if you find the case truly stated, as I doubt not you will I shall be much obliged by a solution on philosophical principles.</P>

<HEAD>MR. <HI>RITTENHOUSE</HI>'S ANSWER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE experiment you mention with a silk hand∣kerchief, and the distant flame of a lamp, is much more curious than one would at first imagine. For the object we see is not the web of the handker∣chief magnified, but something very different, as appears from the following considerations.</P>
<P N="1">1st. A distinct image of any object placed close to the eye, cannot be formed by parallel rays or such as issue from a distant luminous point; for all such rays passing through the pupil, will be col∣lected at the bottom of the eye, and there form an image of the luminous point. The threads of the handkerchief would only intercept part of the rays, and render the image less brilliant.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. If the cross bars we see were images of the silk threads, they must pass over the retina, whilst the threads are made to pass over the pupil;
<PB N="378" REF="024407_0384_0FC704465FB96DF0"/>
but this, as you observe, does not happen for they continue stationary.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. IF the image on the retina was a picture of the object before the eye, it must be fine or coarse according to the texture of the handker∣chief. But it does not change with changing the silk, nor does it change on removing it farther from the eye. And the number of the apparent threads remains the same, whether ten, twenty, or thirty of the silk threads pass across the pupil at the same time. The image we see must, therefore, be formed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> this can be no other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of light in passing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> surfaces of bodies as described by <HI>Newton.</HI></P>
<P>IT is well known in optics, that different images, of the different points of objects without the eye, are formed on the retina by pencils of rays, which before they fall on the eye are inclined to each other in sensible angles: and the great use of telescopes is to encrease these angles regularly, in a certain ratio, suffering such rays as were pa∣rallel before they enter the telescope to proceed on parallel after passing through it. The ex∣tended image which we see in this experiment must therefore be formed by pencils of rays, which be∣fore
<PB N="379" REF="024407_0385_0FC7044F390AC498"/>
they entered the eye, had very considerable degrees of inclination with respect to each other. But coming from a small distant flame of a lamp, they were nearly parallel before they passed through the silk handkerchief. It was therefore the threads of silk which gave them such different directions.</P>
<P>BEFORE the silk is placed to the eye, parallel rays of light will form a single lucid spot as at A
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
in the figure, and this spot will still be formed af∣terwards by such rays as pass through the little meshes uninfluenced by the threads. But suppose the perpendicular threads by their action on the rays to bend a part of them one degree to the right and left, another part two degrees; there will now be four images formed, two on each side of the origi∣nal one at A. By a similar action of the horizontal threads, this line of five lucid spots will be divid∣ed
<PB N="380" REF="024407_0386_0FC704510EDCF650"/>
into five other lines, two above and two be∣low, making a square of 25 bright spots, separa∣ted by four perpendicular dark lines and four horizontal ones; and these lucid spots and dark lines will not change their places on moving the web of silk over the eye, parallel to any of its threads. For the point of the retina on which the image shall fall, is determined by the incidence of the rays with respect to the axis of the eye, and not by the part of the pupil through which they pass.</P>
<P>IN order to make my experiments with more accuracy, I made a square of parallel hairs about half an inch each way; and to have them near∣ly parallel and equidistant, I got a watch maker to cut a very fine screw on two peices of small brass wire. In the threads of these screws, 106 of which made one inch, the hairs were laid, 50 or 60 in num∣ber. Looking thro' these hairs at a small opening in the window shutter of a dark room, 1-30<SUP>th</SUP> of an inch wide and three inches long, holding the hairs parallel to the slit, and looking towards the sky, I saw three parallel lines, almost equal in brightness, and on each side, four or five much fainter, and growing more faint coloured and in∣distinct the further they were from the middle line,
<PB N="381" REF="024407_0387_0FC70452583E5450"/>
which I knew to be formed of such rays as pass between the hairs, uninfluenced by them.</P>
<P>THINKING my apparatus not so perfect as it might be, I took out the hairs, and put in others, something thicker; of these 190 made one inch, and therefore the spaces between them were a∣bout the 1-250<SUP>th</SUP> part of an inch. The three mid∣dle lines of light were now not so bright as they had been before, and the others were stronger and more distinct; and I could count six on each side of the middle line seeming to be equally di∣stant from each other, estimating the distance from the centre of one to the centre of the next. The middle line was still well defined and colourless, the next two were likewise pretty well defined, but something broader, having their inner edges tinged with blue, and their outer edges with red: the others were more indistinct, and consisted each of the prismatic colours, in the same order, which, by spreading more and more, seemed to touch each other at the fifth or sixth line, but those near∣est the middle were separated from each other by very dark lines, much broader than the bright lines.</P>
<P>FINDING the beam of light which came through the window-shutter divided into so many distinct
<PB N="382" REF="024407_0388_0FC7045905837020"/>
pencils, I was desirous of knowing the angles which they made with each other. For this pur∣pose I made use of a small prismatic telescope and micrometer, with which I was favoured by <HI>Dr Franklin.</HI> I fastened the frame of parallel hairs before the object glass, so as to cover its aperture entirely: then looking through the telescope, I measured the space between the two first side lines, and found the angular distance between their inner edges to be 13′ 15″; from the middle of one to the middle of the other 15′ 30″; and from the outer edge of one to the outer edge of the other 17′ 45″. In the first case, I had a fine blue streak in the middle of the object, and in the last a red streak. The other lines were too faint, when seen through the telescope to measure the angles they subtended with accuracy; but from such trials as I made, I am satisfied, that from the second line on one side, to the second on the other side, and so on, they were double, triple▪ quadruple, &amp;c. of the first angles.</P>
<P>IT appears then, that a very considerable portion of the beam of light passed between the hairs with∣out being at all bent out of its course; that ano∣ther smaller portion was bent, at a medium, about 7′ 45″ each way; the red rays a little more, and the blue rays a little less; another still smaller por∣tion
<PB N="383" REF="024407_0389_0FC7045B81F18730"/>
15′ 30″; another 23′ 15″, and so on. But that no light, or next to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one, was bent in any an∣gle less than 6′, nor any light of any particular colour in any intermediate angle between those which arise from doubling, tripling, &amp;c. of the angle in which it is bent in the first side lines.</P>
<P>I was surprised to find that the red rays are more bent out of their first direction, and the blue rays less, as if the hairs acted with more force on the red than on the blue rays; contrary to what happens by refraction, when light passes obliquely through the common surface of two different mediums. It is, however, consonant to what sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI> observes with respect to the fringes that border the shadows of hairs and other bodies; his words are—<Q>And, therefore, the hair, in causing these fringes, acted alike upon the red light, or least refrangible rays, at a greater distance, and upon the violet or most refrangible rays, at a less dis∣tance; and by those actions disposed the red light into larger fringes, and the violet into smal∣ler fringes.</Q></P>
<P>BY pursuing these experiments, it is probable that new and interesting discoveries may be made respecting the properties of this wonderful sub∣stance, <HI>light,</HI> which animates all nature in the eyes
<PB N="384" REF="024407_0390_0FC7045CD33FFA80"/>
of man, and perhaps, above all things, disposes him to acknowledge the Creator's bounty. But want of leisure obliges me to quit the subject for the present.</P>

<HEAD>ORATIONS, WRITTEN FOR, AND AT THE REQUEST OF YOUNG GENTLEMEN OF THE UNIVERSITY, AND DELIVERED BY THEM AT PUBLIC COMMENCEMENTS IN THE COLLEGE HALL.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="speech">
<OPENER><SALUTE>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING gone through the usual course of education in this seminary of learning; having passed the ordeal trials of private and public exami∣nations, I am now in full expectation of receiving those parchment honours, which are to testify the success of my studies, and prove, to a believing world, that my labour hath not been in vain.</P>
<P>BUT it has been insinuated to me, that before my temples can be crowned with collegiate laurels,
<PB N="2" REF="024407_0395_0FC700466A996D10"/>
it is expected that I should address you, ladies and gentlemen, in an elegant speech on this grand occasion.</P>
<P>UNREASONABLE as this demand seemed to be, nevertheless, being long accustomed to submit, I earnestly endeavoured to comply with it. I had re∣course to books, to solitary walks, ardent invocati∣ons, and all the usual provocatives to good writing. I chose for my subject the dignity of the sciences, and the excellent mode of attaining them in this uni∣versity. I began with a warm apostrophe to this build∣ing, in manner and form following:—Oh, ye sacred walls! ye venerable stools and benches! and thou, expanded arch! that hast so often echoed back the sweet effusions of those aspiring youths who have, in times past, been nurtured within your hallowed precincts—hear! oh hear! one of your latest sons testify the ardour with which he feels himself in∣spired!—Thus far, all was well—but what to say next was the difficulty. Whilst I was making eve∣ry possible effort to proceed, an unlucky line of a distressed poet, who was composing new-year's verses, popped into my head, viz.
<Q>What can I say, that ha'nt been said before?</Q></P>
<P>THIS ridiculous question quenched all my en∣thusiasm in a moment—like a spark drawn from the
<PB N="3" REF="024407_0396_0FC700481841CEF0"/>
prime conductor, the electrometer fell instantly, and I gave up the point.</P>
<P>NOTHING could be more unfortunate: I cer∣tainly proposed, ladies and gentlemen, to have made you a very fine speech, in the customary style, but my good intention having been thus unhappily frustrated, I must e'en depend upon the chance of the moment for what I shall say; and I doubt not, but that you, my benevolent hearers, will at least wish me good luck, and a happy escape from my my present difficulty.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH I am under a necessity to change the intended stile of my speech, I shall not entirely abandon the subject I had chosen; but shall en∣deavour to give this polite audience some juvenile strictures on the present system of what is called a learned education: in doing which, I hope I may be allowed the privilege of speaking freely without giving offence. Although I shall never think my∣self discharged from the obligations I owe to these my kind and reverend instructors, for their care and attention to me; yet, being now emancipated from their immediate control, I shall take the li∣berty of giving a free scope to my sentiments, with∣out regarding how far they may run foul of the stated opinions and prejudices of the schools.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="024407_0397_0FC7004CF4C18228"/>TO begin, then, the detail of our instruction.— After the youngster hath been taught to spell, read, and write, in his mother tongue, he ascends the first step of learned education.—The <HI>Latin lan∣guage</HI> is the object, to attain which, a Latin gram∣mar is put into the poor boy's hands. This gram∣mar is called the rudiments or foundation of that language: by which one might suppose, that the grammar had been given by inspiration, and the Romans derived their language from it. But the fact is just the reverse; for in every language, the grammar is, and must necessarily be, the result, and not the origin of that language: but notwith∣standing this undeniable truth, the Latin must be inculcated according to the method and discipline of the schools, <HI>a posteriori,</HI> in more senses than one.—Well! through this grammar, at all events, the bewildered pupil must wade, groping for a year or two in utter darkness, and learning by rote a complicated system of rules, the propriety or ap∣plication of which it is impossible for him to see in any instance.</P>
<P>THESE rules are framed partly in elegant prose, and partly in much more elegant verse, in order, I suppose, to insinuate to the student some taste for Latin poetry, whilst he is learning the rudiments of the language. If I had not, ladies, a re∣spectful
<PB N="5" REF="024407_0398_0FC70050F44BDCF8"/>
regard for your ears, and no small ten∣derness for my own teeth, I would give you a sam∣ple of our grammar versification.</P>
<P>AFTER these rules have been got by rote, as I said before, it may be thought that there is no∣thing more necessary to the knowledge of the La∣tin tongue—But Alas! this is only the beginning of troubles—The rules must not only be got by memory, but the exceptions also to those rules—Now, good people, you must know that these exceptions, are so very numerous, that, in many cases, it is immaterial which you choose for a standard, the rule itself, or the exception.</P>
<P>THE excellency of this method of teaching a language by means of its grammar, may be illustra∣ted by a familiar parallel. You must know, ladies, that when a man stands, or walks, or performs any motions of the body, such positions and motions are all reducible to mathematical principles. In all cases, it is necessary that what is called the cen∣tre of gravity should be supported, were it other∣mise, the person must unavoidably fall to the ground: and thus are all our movements redu∣cible to system. Now, if the present mode of education is right, and who dares assert it is not, you should not suffer your children to walk,
<PB N="6" REF="024407_0399_0FC70055F5257800"/>
or even attempt to walk, before they have learned these rules, for which purpose you must necessarily provide mathematical nurses and geometrical danc∣ing masters. Oh the excellence of learning! What delight must it afford the fond parent, to see young master standing like the rafters of a house, and miss dancing in triangles, rhomboides, and trapeziums.</P>
<P>BUT to proceed. We will suppose the young student hath made some advances in the know∣ledge of the Latin language, according to the me∣thod proposed. The first observable consequence is, that he loses, or at least gains, no ground in a taste for the elegancies of his native tongue. His diction becomes stiff and awkward, and his hand writing intolerable. So that whilst he is studying the anatomy of a dead language, he re∣mains a stranger to the beauties of the living.</P>
<P>IT is probable that there are many amongst the ladies, whom I have now the honour to address, who have never studied grammar, or know any thing of its rules; and yet I venture to affirm, that a few lines, written by your fair hands, and dictated by gentle nature, shall convey more lively sensibilities, and shall find a shorter way to the heart, than a whole page—aye, or forty of them —composed by the most learned grammarian, with
<PB N="7" REF="024407_0400_0FC7005928526340"/>
<HI>Dilworth</HI> on his right hand, and <HI>Entick</HI> on his left.</P>
<P>IN the mean time the assiduous youth reads <HI>Ovid's Metamorphosis,</HI> for the improvement of his morals; and learns from <HI>Horace,</HI> to be chaste and temperate. <HI>That</HI> time which might usefully be employed in studying the histories of those nati∣ons with whom we are, or may be connected, is consumed in reading the delectable and lamentable story of <HI>Aeneas</HI> and queen <HI>Dido.</HI> The one, a hero of so insignificant a cast, that all the laudable ingredients of his character may be comprised in the words <HI>Pius Aeneas;</HI> and the other, to speak delicately, not the most shining example of female virtue and moderation. The one, a discourteous knight, and the other a furious enamorata.</P>
<P>IT just occurs to me, that Dido's greatest misfor∣tune was, that she lived in a barbarous age, when lawyers were not to be had for love or money. Had her famous amour happened in our day, she might have recovered at least £. 750 damages;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This alludes to a circumstance of the time something like the case of queen <HI>Dido.</HI></NOTE> which, all things considered, would have been
<PB N="8" REF="024407_0401_0FC7005D36BEF038"/>
much better than cutting her throat upon a wood∣pile—As desperate Dido did—This by the bye.</P>
<P>THE young student is at length fitted for the higher classes of science. He learns mathematicks, geography, natural philosophy, logic, ethics, and metaphysics.</P>
<P>WITH respect to the three first, I would only say—That if they were divested of some scientific pedantry (I mean as they are taught in the schools), they are worthy the attention of a ratio∣nal mind, inasmuch as they advance the know∣ledge of truth; for of all valuable things, <HI>truth</HI> is the most valuable.</P>
<P>BUT of all the systems of complicated nonsense, that ever puzzled the busy brains of mortal man, <HI>logic</HI> is surely the most insignificant. An art which no ingenuity can apply to any one useful purpose of life. Imagine to yourselves, gentle hearers, a society of <HI>logicians,</HI> whose conversation in the common occurrences of life should be conducted in <HI>syllogistic</HI> mode and form. The learned house∣keeper goes to market, and endeavours to per∣suade the butcher to lower the price of his mut∣ton in <HI>celarent;</HI> the butcher enforces his demand in <HI>barbara.</HI> The logical lover also attacks his dulcinea in form. He assures her, in <HI>particular af∣firmatives,</HI>

their reverences begin to frown—I shall, therefore, not urge this subject any further.</P>
<P><HI>ETHICS</HI> and <HI>metaphysics</HI> bring up the rear of a learned education. It would tire your patience, my indulgent hearers, should I enter upon a detail of all the whimsical absurdities with which these sciences abound. If a man should conduct him∣self through life, according to the strict rules of <HI>ethics,</HI> he would be just as ridiculous as the knight of <HI>La Mancha,</HI> governing himself in the most com∣mon occurrences by the solemn formalities of chivalry.</P>
<P>AS to <HI>metaphysics,</HI> it is a visionary system, where∣in uncertain conclusions are drawn from uncertain premises, and in which the very terms used have no determinate meaning. The whole is an inge∣nious fabric built in air; having no real, known foundation, whereon to rest: not unlike the Pa∣gan creed, that the world stands upon the horns of a bull; the bull on the back of an elephant; the elephant on a great tortoise; and the great tor∣toise upon nothing.</P>
<P>IT must be owned, however, that we are in∣debted to metaphysics for some very curious and entertaining riddles: such as—that <HI>infinite</HI> carried <PB N="11" REF="024407_0404_0FC70066AC007720"/>
beyond <HI>infinity</HI> becomes <HI>finite</HI>—that one <HI>infinity</HI>
may be twice as long as another <HI>infinity</HI>—that <HI>soul</HI>
is not <HI>matter,</HI> and that <HI>matter</HI> is not <HI>soul;</HI> and in short, that it is no matter whether there be any soul or not—Oh! the heighths and the depths of learning!</P>
<P>THUS, ladies and gentlemen, I have given you the outlines of a scholastic education. My first intention was to have discussed this subject in high strains of panegyric; but as this will be better done by some of my fellow-students, I refer you to them for those sublime flights of imagination which please the ear, but have nothing to do with the understanding or with truth.</P>
<P>I shall conclude my address with one reasonable request, which is, that you, my benevolent au∣ditors, may extend the same indulgence to me you usually do to the orators of this place, by forget∣ting every word you have heard as soon as you have left this hall <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is a pulpit on the stage, and the hall is frequently used as a place of worship.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>THE present topic of conversation, the ob∣ject of universal attention, and the idols before which the unthinking multitude prostrate them∣selves in superstitious adoration, are the late most glorious peace, as it is called, and the freedom and independence of the United States of America established thereby. <HI>Peace, liberty,</HI> and <HI>indepen∣dence,</HI> have been echoed from one end of this great continent to the other, and their praises set to e∣very note in the scale of music: they have been be∣prosed, and be-rhymed, and be-fiddled out of all measure, and out of all tune, as if the prosperity— nay, the salvation of our country, had no other foundation whereon to rest.</P>
<P>FOR my part, I do not find myself disposed to throw my judgement into the common stock, to be
<PB N="14" REF="024407_0407_0FC70076C09A3490"/>
carried down by the undistinguishing current of popular opinion—<HI>Peace, liberty,</HI> and <HI>independence!</HI> Very pretty words indeed; they look exceedingly well on paper; whether they be written in round hand, Italian hand, square text, German text, or a∣ny other text, provided they be fairly written. This may please the eye; but let us consider a little how they will satisfy the understanding; how far they are calculated to meet the approbation of an inqui∣sitive, penetrating mind: and this will best be as∣certained by taking a view of the consequences and effects which they are likely to produce.</P>
<P>AS to the first—Can any thing be more absurd than to suppose that <HI>peace</HI> is really productive of happiness? Is not the contrary demonstrable? Let us, for a moment, imagine that all the inhabitants of the world should remain for a whole century in perfect peace and harmony. That no such thing as public war, or private quarrels, should exist in that period, a situation, to be sure not pos∣sible, nature having wisely ordered matters other∣wise; but suppose it to be so, What would be the consequence? The uninterrupted friendly inter∣course between nations by commerce, and between individuals by contract, would soon reduce the wealth of the world to a level. All emulation would cease, and every spur to industry be blunted,
<PB N="15" REF="024407_0408_0FC70079C814CD48"/>
or done away. Luxury and insolence would, like a general plague, infect communities, and spread their baneful influences every where. The course of human life, running on in even channels and an unbroken calm, would become insupport∣ably tedious, and engender green melancholy, and four discontent, unless accidental discoveries of artificial gratifications, for artificial appetites, should now and then occasion some slight varia∣tions in the disgusting scene, by affording a tem∣porary but fatal relief. A miserable corruption of morals, debauchery, and consequent languor and disease, would reduce the human species to a state of degeneracy; insomuch, that for aught I know, a second deluge would be necessary to purge the earth of its filthy inhabitants. No, it is <HI>war</HI>— spirited <HI>war,</HI> the clashing of interests, interfer∣ing passions, public contests, and private animosi∣ties, that give energy to the pursuits of men, and furnish a theatre whereon the heroic virtues of the heart, and the active powers of the mind, may ex∣hibit themselves to advantage. Look round, and you will find that nature, in all her works, shews a fondness for contest, having made opposition the life of the world. What is animal health but a due mixture of contending qualities? Solids melting into fluids, and fluids coagulating into so∣lids; acids and alkalies maintaining perpetual war, and rushing together in esserves<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing conflict; vio∣lent

intestine motions from fermentation and diges∣tion; muscles contracted by muscles, pulling in opposite directions, and every property balanced by another of a contrary nature: let all this in∣ternal conflict be composed; let the animal mi∣crocosm be in perfect peace, and the certain con∣sequence will be death and putrefaction. So also in the elements: showers of rain, storms of wind, thunder and lightning, are absolutely necessary in the oeconomy of our atmosphere. Without these, the healthful air would soon become a pestilential vapour, and the vast ocean, a stagnant pool of corruption. It is manifest, therefore, that nature delights in contest; and never intended that either the moral, or material world should remain in un∣interrupted peace.</P>
<P>AS to <HI>liberty,</HI> it is difficult to say in what it really consists. Men having not yet affixed any precise idea to the word. The people of different coun∣tries have very different notions of it. What a European would call <HI>liberty,</HI> a <HI>Cherokee</HI> Indian would consider as a most cruel restraint. If the word be taken in its fullest extent, viz. a right and power to do whatever we please, it is a privilege which no man ever did or could enjoy; an imagi∣nary state of nature, in which men are supposed to have lived without control, and in which every
<PB N="17" REF="024407_0410_0FC7008166023D68"/>
individual was a sovereign, has served as the foun∣dation of many ingenious systems, and learned dis∣sertations, by civilians, moralists, and metaphysici∣ans; but even these profound philosophers are so far from esteeming such a state a blessing, that they derive all the advantages of civil society, and the good of mankind from a resignation of this natu∣ral liberty, which they assure us is altogether in∣compatible with the security and happiness of the individual.</P>
<P>BUT if we take the word in a more limited sense, as it is generally considered, when the terms <HI>civil</HI> or <HI>political</HI> liberty are used, I would ask, what are the great advantages derived from it? or, rather, what inconveniences does it not bring with it? <HI>Civil liberty</HI> consists, chiefly, in a people's being go∣verned by no laws, but such as they have themselves made or assented to; in not being obliged to part with their property without their consent; and in holding their lives and estates secure from the ca∣pricious resentments of arbitrary power, or the grasping hand of over-weening avarice: but should not a prudent man consider that all this liberty brings with it a deal of trouble and expence?</P>
<P>HAD <HI>Great-Britain</HI> succceded in her views with respect to this country, we should not have been
<PB N="18" REF="024407_0411_0FC7008495050310"/>
put to the laborious task of framing laws for our own government, a task which we seem but in∣differently qualified to perform; we should have been rid of the intolerable plague, the heart-burn∣ings, feuds, cabals, and chicaneries attending popu∣lar elections, and we should have been eased of the enormous expence of assemblymen's wages, com∣missions, fees and salaries to the officers of govern∣ment, and a thousand other charges and inconve∣niences to which we must now be subjected: we should have had nothing more to do, but to pay when called upon, and obey when commanded. This further consideration ought also to have some weight, that if we had been cruelly and unjustly oppressed by a people three thousand miles off, all the world would have pitied our situation, which is no small consolation in trouble, and exclaimed against the tyranny of our oppressors: whereas, should things go wrong now, we shall have none to blame but ourselves▪ and when we complain, the natural answer will be, if you have placed men in power who abuse their trust, it is your own fault:—why did you not make a better choice? Your sufferings are the effect of your own folly, and therefore you deserve no pity. These are se∣rious considerations. As to property being secured by political liberty, I would observe that this is a position more specious perhaps than true. The
<PB N="19" REF="024407_0412_0FC7008572727978"/>
payment of no taxes, but such as are levied by our own consent, form a pretty arrangement of words and ideas; but, strictly speaking, the fact is seldom really so. No man pays a tax with his own con∣sent, that is, he would rather not pay it, if he could refuse with honour and safety. The payment of taxes is always attended with some reluctance of mind, and often with open murmurings and com∣plaints, either as to the time, purpose, or propor∣tion of the tax. The case is quite otherwise when money is taken from us by the strong hand of ar∣bitrary power: all reasoning, all deliberation is out of the question—we have nothing to do but pay—and so the mind is saved a deal of trouble and vexation. This <HI>paying</HI> may, indeed, have a ten∣dency to poverty—and so much the better; for poverty incites industry, and industry is the mother of health and contentment.</P>
<P>TO illustrate my meaning by a familiar instance: suppose a traveller meets a friend on the road, who requests him to give or lend him a small sum of money for a present purpose: the traveller he∣sitates; he cannot decently refuse; and yet he would rather the request had not been made: in this conflict his mind suffers no small anxie∣ty. But should a highwayman present a pistol to his breast, and with oaths and imprecations de∣mand
<PB N="20" REF="024407_0413_0FC70086F30D5600"/>
his cash, with what chearfulness, with what expedition will he produce his purse? and think himself happy in coming off so well.</P>
<P>WITH respect to life's not being secure under a despotic government, I have only to observe, that no one can justly complain of an injury he ne∣ver suffered; and that after the evil hath hap∣pened, the party will not be in a condition to complain. So much for civil liberty.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>independence,</HI> cries the American; What have you to say against <HI>independence</HI>? The glory of our country, the reward of our va∣lour, and the fruit of our seven years sufferings, and bloody contest. This is mere popular excla∣mation. Let us view the thing in its true light, and we shall find that all the disadvantages atten∣ding civil liberty, some of which I have enume∣rated, are applicable to independence, together with many additional consequences.</P>
<P>WHILST we were dependent upon Great Bri∣tain, we had no trouble in studying the characters, customs, and manners of foreign nations; the English were so kind as to furnish us with all their ideas on these subjects. They told us, that the <HI>French</HI> are a trifling and contemptible nation;
<PB N="21" REF="024407_0414_0FC7009260223A10"/>
that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are proud, sullen, and re∣vengeful; the <HI>Germans,</HI> ostentatious; the <HI>Ho∣landers,</HI> boors; the <HI>Russians,</HI> savages; and, in short, that the English were themselves the only people fit to live and govern the word, as if all other nations held their dominions by usurpation. How easy was it to believe all this? Implicit faith saves an infinity of trouble. How happy were we in submitting to the government, adopting the prejudices, and aping the manners of a nation, which we conceived to be the glory of the world, and the perfection of human nature?</P>
<P>WHEREAS, now, we are under the painful ne∣cessity of altering our sentiments. We are compel∣led by actual experience to acknowledge, that the <HI>French</HI> are a brave, generous, and polished peo∣ple: and that none of the other nations are, in truth, such as they have been represented to us. Our commercial connections will convince us that human nature is fundamentally the same in every country. That good and bad men are to be found in every climate; and that the people of England have not actually monopolized all the virtue and wisdom of the world. Every convic∣tion of error, is a violence done to the mind, in∣asmuch as the forcible eradication of a preju∣dice
<PB N="22" REF="024407_0415_0FC70093870BAA48"/>
must be attended with a painful sensation. The blind man is happy in his blindness, and the ignorant content with his ignorance. The wisest of men, has some where told us, that the en∣crease of wisdom is the encrease of sorrow.</P>
<P>ANOTHER inconvenience attending our indepen∣dence is this—The imposts and duties heretofore laid on our commerce, contributed to the revenue of a prince three thousand miles distant, it was therefore not thought disreputable for the mer∣chant to evade the payment of those duties, if he could. How delightful was it to exercise every species of ingenuity and craft in bilking collectors and customhouse officers! And how sweet was the enjoyment of the profits so obtained! But our independence has deprived us of all these commercial advantages; as it would be dishonour∣ble, and even wicked, to evade the duties laid by our own laws, and for the support of our own go∣vernment.</P>
<P>I have now discharged my conscience, and shall leave the decisi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to your own judgments. If, notwithstanding all I have said, and all I might have said, you will be so blind as to prefer a state of freedom, with all its cares and troubles, to a state of dependence and slavery, which requires nothing but implicit faith, and implicit obedience:

<HEAD>☞ AT a public commencement in the university, an argument was held for and against the practice of DUELLING; the following speech was written for the young gentleman who took the defensive side.</HEAD>
<P>— I Marvel my fellow-student did not ascend the pulpit, and deliver his pious harangue from thence. You have been entertained, my worthy hearers, with a sort of chapter against DUELLING: the orator has entrenched himself behind certain texts of scripture, and some vulgar prejudices— these make up the sum total of his argument; for, as to the rest, it was mere declamation.</P>
<P>YOU may make what use you please of his fine speech; but if you imagine that his private senti∣ments coincide with his public declamation, you may find yourselves much mistaken. He has too much good manners to interrupt me, or he would probably ask,—how I came to know his private sentiments? I answer from his own words just now delivered: "I hope, (said he) this polite audi∣ence will give me a candid hearing upon this sub∣ject, and entertain no unfavourable sentiments of
<PB N="25" REF="024407_0418_0FC700A13B64C1F8"/>
my courage, though I should condemn it"—mean∣ing the practice of duelling. This preparatory <HI>salvo</HI> may be paraphrased thus: "I am going, good people, to give you a declamation against the custom of fighting duels. This you must know is not an undertaking of my own choice, but has been imposed upon me. I must, therefore, make the best of it I can. But if you, or any of you, should conclude from what I shall now say, that I have not courage to defend my insulted honour, I tell you before hand, you have mistaken your man." This much, indeed, I can answer for the gentleman—I have known him some considerable length of time, and have not found him more meek and patient than his neighbours: but I leave him to answer for himself, and only request your kind attention, whilst I offer some arguments in answer to his fine speech, and in justification of the prac∣tice of duelling.</P>
<P>THE gentleman has told us, that duelling derives its origin from the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandals,</HI> and those other barbarous nations which over-ran Europe, and extinguished all the refinements of art, science, and morality: that these savages, not having saga∣city sufficient to determine in matters of private controversy, referred the dispute to the decision of heaven, by bringing the parties to mortal combat,
<PB N="26" REF="024407_0419_0FC700A3626C6C78"/>
under a belief that God would interfere in favour of right and justice.</P>
<P>SUPPOSING this to have been the real pedigree of duelling, I think it no dishonourable one: it was neither irreverend nor irrational to believe in a particular, as well as a general providence, and to submit to his unerring judgment and all-seeing eye, the detection of truth, and the administration of justice.</P>
<P>BUT I shall delve much deeper for the root of this practice; and am confident in asserting, that it is not founded in the customs of any parti∣cular age or nation, barbarous or civilized; but is inherent in the nature of man; is part of his ori∣ginal constitution, and coeval with his creation.</P>
<P>BEFORE laws were formed for restriction, or re∣velation given for instruction, man walked in the paths of natural liberty: he had a right to every thing his strength or wisdom could acquire, and to resent every injury according to his power and magnanimity. This right was indelibly recorded in the texture of his constitution: his Creator had given him such passions of the mind, and such pow∣ers of body for the purpose, as could by no means be mistaken. The ultimate object was the hap∣piness
<PB N="27" REF="024407_0420_0FC700A4E54AC4A8"/>
of the individual, in its sustenance and secu∣rity: but the race of mankind greatly encreasing, their intercourses and interferences became more frequent. The weak and timid were not able to stand against the strong and courageous: they lost their property, and had not strength to recover it: they received insults and injuries, and had not spi∣rit to resent. At length they had recourse to cun∣ning to obtain that security which they could not accomplish by valour; and formed a device which should put the weakest upon a footing with the strongest of their own species. This was the ori∣gin of civil society. A solemn compact was made, wherein every individual, for himself, and for his posterity, resigned his natural liberty, and natural rights, into the hands of the collective body of the whole.—And what did the individual receive in return? Why a solemn assurance, that all his inju∣ries should be redressed, his property secured, and his personal rights and dignities supported and de∣fended by <HI>the whole.</HI></P>
<P>IT is on this compact that I ground my argu∣ments in defence of duelling. The powers of this <HI>whole,</HI> or of society, are exhibited and exerted in the execution of laws. To the laws, therefore, must every individual apply for justice. And I do not hesitate to acknowledge, that in all cases,
<PB N="28" REF="024407_0421_0FC700AE1CD272D0"/>
where the laws can give compotent satisfaction, no man ought to attempt the redress of his own wrongs. But if there should be cases wherein a man may suffer the most attrocious injuries, and the most provoking indignities, for which the laws have made no provision at all, or no adequate pro∣vision, I say recourse may and ought to be had to original natural rights for redress; the compact between the <HI>whole</HI> and the individual having been so far violated on the part of society.</P>
<P>FOR instance; if my neighbour should claim a title to my land, it would be very absurd in me to send him a challenge to determine on titles by sword and pistol. The laws of the country are quite competent to this business, and by the social compact aforesaid, I, or my ancestors for me, a∣greed to submit the determination to them. But if an adversary, either in my presence, or behind my back, should load me with unmerited abuse, stain my reputation with injurious falsehoods, and scandalize me with the approbrious terms of <HI>rogue, rascal, scoundrel, villain,</HI> &amp;c. how am I to obtain redress? I appeal to the laws; the learned judge puts on his spectacles, and after turning over his common place book, and referring to many folio authorities, he tells me, with phlegmatic solem∣nity, that he can find no such words there: that
<PB N="29" REF="024407_0422_0FC700AF45D59B48"/>
the law has assigned no meaning to these ap∣pellations; and that my action will not—Hea∣vens and earth! what has my wounded honour to do with law meanings? Hath not all the world agreed in the obloquy of these terms? Do they not imply every thing that is base, disho∣nourable, and contemptible? But they are not known in law. Very well; I appeal then to those laws which are not too learned to understand, nor reluctant in recognizing the manifest injury that has been done to me; I appeal to the court of nature, where I am sure my action will lie. I say, that in such instances, the compact with my pro∣genitors hath been broken by society; and that neither they, or myself, ever gave up this right of appeal.</P>
<P>IT seems then sufficiently manifest, that I still retain a natural right to resent those injuries for which the laws of society have made no provision. But how am I to do this? By secret machinations! by poisons! by assassination! No—Heaven for∣bid! Neither the laws of nature, or of honour, justify such treacherous practices. I reproach my adversary with the unprovoked wrong. I call him forth to defend the licentiousness of his tongue by the valour of his arm. I generously put myself upon the same footing with my foe. I expose my
<PB N="30" REF="024407_0423_0FC700B028846BD8"/>
life in defence of my reputation, which is dearer than life, and depend upon Heaven, and the jus∣tice of my cause, for the important event.</P>
<P>IT is in vain to oppose a few sophistical reasons and vulgar prejudices, to a custom authorised by nature, confirmed by the practice of every age and nation, sanctified by divine permission, and avowedly established by the civil law.</P>
<P>IT may be thought that I have ventured too far in these assertions; but I have ventured no far∣ther than I can well justify.</P>
<P>THAT it is authorised by nature, I have alrea∣dy sufficiently shewn. That it hath been the prac∣tice of every age and nation, will not be denied. History abuduantly proves it. That it hath been sanctified by divine permission, may be shewn in many instances. Not to be tedious, I shall only refer to the famous duel fought between <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Goliah</HI> in the valley of <HI>Elah.</HI> But that this cus∣tom, or at least the principle on which it is founded, is established by the civil law, requires a little ex∣planation.</P>
<P>I ask, then, in what law of nature is the law of nations founded which justifies public war?
<PB N="31" REF="024407_0424_0FC700B1B5A35A90"/>
What say the books? The most approved writers on this subject? They tell us, that if a dispute happens between two princes, or the nations over which they preside, there is no power on earth autho∣rized to determine the controversy. There are no degrees in sovereignty. Nations are to be considered as individuals in a state of nature, and the civil law is nothing more than the laws of na∣ture respecting individuals applied to nations, so far as that can be done with consistency. There∣fore, say these authorities, as there is no earth∣ly judge impowered to determine a controver∣sy between nation and nation, the parties must, and have a right to, take up arms, and rest their cause on the bloody arbitrament of war; trusting that Heaven will favour the right. In fact, the contending nations fight a great and mighty duel. And are not these the very prin∣ciples upon which I have endeavoured to justify private duels? If all the powers of earth should agree to a form a national society, and should resign their respective individual sovereignties into the hands of <HI>the whole,</HI> and form a system of a general law for the adjustment of national controversies, and the redress of national wrongs, public war would then become unjustifiable, unless in cases where no provision had been made by the general system: in such cases the contending
<PB N="32" REF="024407_0425_0FC700BCA8D45CB0"/>
powers would certainly go to war, and fight a na∣tional duel.</P>
<P>HAVING been thus large in establishing a solid foundation whereon to rest my argument, I shall not take up much of your time in what remains. I shall rather suggest hints than dilate opinions on the uses and benefits which society derives from the existence of this custom.</P>
<P>FOR these we need only look into the scenes of polite life, public assemblies, the army, the na∣vy, and the courts of princes. If every hot tem∣pered, over-bearing, ill-mannered fellow could in∣dulge his surly humour, or vent his capricious spleen without apprehending any consequences, but such as the heavy paced law might bring on, our scenes of pleasure, urbanity, and polite∣ness would become bear-gardens of confusion, resounding with noisy broils, and malicious al∣tercations. A duel—the fatal determination of sword or pistol is a very serious business. Even the most passionate and imprudent caveller, will be cautious how he involves himself in so trouble∣some an affair. And this consideration keeps many a licentious spirit within the limits of decorum.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="024407_0426_0FC700BE7019C050"/>A prudent man will take every reasonable, e∣very honourable, means to prevent a quarrel from coming to so critical an issue, and will advance as far towards explanation and reconciliation as may be consistent with his enjoyment of that reputa∣tion and esteem, without which life itself is of lit∣tle value.</P>
<P>I readily acknowledge, that duels sometimes happen upon too trivial occasions; and that the rational and honourable means of clearing up mis∣takes, and reconciling differences, are not always employed as they should be; but the abuse of any principle or practice should not be admitted as an argument for its abolition,</P>
<P>LASTLY, the rays of beauty ever gild the lau∣rels of the brave. He who has not spirit to de∣fend his own honour, will make but a poor pro∣tector of the delicate sex. The lovely nymph will turn aside from the sighing insignificance of the perfumed coward; and rush to meet the hero, panting with love and the toils of war. When an <HI>Alexander</HI> and a <HI>Thais</HI> unite, every voice is ready to join in chorus with the poet.</P>
<L>"Happy! happy! happy pair!</L>
<L>"None but the brave deserves the fair."</L>

<OPENER><SALUTE>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE have invited you to this place, and you have condescended to accept of our invitation. It is rather too late now to enquire what our abi∣lities can furnish for your entertainment; or, what your expectations ought to be. Here we are, and notwithstanding much self-sufficiency and flat∣tering hope, on the part of my companions, it turns out just as I expected; that we must depend on your good nature for a favourable reception, and not on the excellence of our performances.</P>
<P>MY own opinion was much opposed to the whole scheme, being greatly apprehensive, that we should only expose ourselves before so polite and judicious an audience. But no—it would be <HI>fourth
<PB N="35" REF="024407_0428_0FC700C740EC63A0"/>
of July</HI>—every one had something clever to say on the occasion—the subject would recommend itself —the ladies would be pleased—the gentlemen would have too much complaisance to oppose their opinions with harsh criticisms—and all would be well:—I wish it may be so with all my heart.</P>
<P>IT must be confessed, that this public speaking is but a dull kind of entertainment, especially when administered by young and unexperienced orators, on subjects which have been so frequently and ful∣ly investigated, as to leave scarce a flower in the field for us to gather. In this situation what more can we do than make a very good bow at the be∣ginning of our speech, and a much better one at the end of it; and ever this is more than we are all able to perform, as you may have already observed.</P>
<P>IT is customary with professed and skilful ora∣tors to supplicate the candid indulgence of their auditors. This is frequently, with them, only a ceremonious compliment; but with us, you may depend upon it, it is a sincere and earnest request. For it must certainly exercise the most practised pa∣tience, to see a lad stand, bolt upright for half an hour, like the definition of a perpendicular line in Euclid, and utter what he calls a <HI>speech;</HI> or to see ano¦ther
<PB N="36" REF="024407_0429_0FC700C99E5C0C88"/>
bounce about the stage, and vociferate a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> oration; as if eloquence was the produce of agili∣ty of body and strength of lungs. The only apo∣logy that can be made is, that we do the best in our power, and are in hopes of performing better hereafter.</P>
<P>TO speak in public with propriety and effect, requires many talents, natural and acquired. The object of all public speaking is <HI>persuasion:</HI> to make other people believe or act according to the speak∣er's mind. For this purpose, it is necessary that the orator should have a <HI>pleasing address, a lively imagination, a thorough knowledge of his subject, and a good ear,</HI> with respect to the language in which he is to deliver his sentiments.</P>
<P>FIRST impressions have an unavoidable influ∣ence on the mind. The most judicious and im∣partial hearers conceive some predilection for, or prejudice against, the speaker on his very first ap∣pearance. It is, therefore, of great importance, that a genteel manner, and graceful address, should bespeak the favourable attention of the audience; otherwise, the orator will not only have to encoun∣ter the difficulties incident to his subject, but must also labour against a foreign influence: whereas a genteel figure, graceful deportment, and a pleasing
<PB N="37" REF="024407_0430_0FC700CDDF58F6A0"/>
address, sometimes operate in his favour to greater advantage than all the force of his arguments; and what is of infinite importance, he is sure of the good opinion of the ladies.</P>
<P><HI>A lively imagination</HI> will enable the orator to throw an air of novelty over his subject, and to present it in points of view in which it hath not frequently been considered. To enforce his argu∣ments with apt allusions, and embellish the whole with striking metaphors. To hear a dull and hackneyed subject elaborately discussed by a dull and phlegmatic speaker, affords about as much entertainment, as to hear a demonstration from Euclid, proving a proposition, which cannot be de∣nied; or a string of logical syllogisms, proving nothing at all.</P>
<P><HI>A thorough knowledge of his subject,</HI> I have laid down as the next requisite in a public speaker. This, I confess, is not absolutely necessary; as there are many who make a very tolerable figure without it. It might, indeed, be extremely incon∣venient to make this rule strict and general, inas∣much as there would be danger of silencing one third of the gentlemen of the bar; one-half of the orators of the pulpit; and three-fourths of the speakers in parliaments and houses of assembly:
<PB N="38" REF="024407_0431_0FC700CEE4E140F0"/>
yet it seems but reasonable, that an author should have some knowledge of the subject he is hand∣ling; and, therefore, this rule is rather recom∣mended than insisted upon.</P>
<P><HI>A good ear</HI> is the last mentioned, though not the least important qualification of a good speaker. If his language is pure, his periods harmoniously arranged, and his voice melodiously adapted to the construction of every sentence, the orator will not fail to charm his hearers, even though there should be but a very scanty portion of solid sense diluted in his flowing rhetoric. The mind is insensibly captivated by pleasing sounds, and the most obdurate judgment yields to the ma∣gic influence of sweet harmony. It is, therefore, absolutely necessary that authors of little sense should pay great attention to the powers of sound; for every hearer expects to be either instructed or pleased; and he has a right ta expect it.</P>
<P>IT is next to impossible to lay down rules for harmonious composition. When words and sen∣tences are so arranged, as to produce a pleasing melody, all acknowledge the effect, but none can point out that particular construction in which the magic consists. Grammar rules have nothing to do with it; for a sentence may be strictly gram∣matical,
<PB N="39" REF="024407_0432_0FC700D0763E5A40"/>
and yet as offensive to the ear as the sharp∣ening of a saw. For instance, observe the contrast between the two following sentences; both of which are equally unexceptionable in point of grammar.</P>
<P>"SOME have a happy talent of expression, whereby they compensate the want of sentiment, by the melody of their style; their language, ever flowing like a wave of the sea, and their periods closing in such musical cadence, that the ear is fascinated by the magic of sound, and the mind lulled in a pleasing repose."</P>
<P>"OTHERS, without giving to grammar rules offence, shall arrange so unskillfully their words, breaking, as it were, and interrupting the sense, or rather nonsense, they mean to inculcate, by frequent (and oft-times unnecessary) parenthesis, that the ear stumbles through the rugged para∣graph, as the feet would stumble in scrambling through a street, when the pavement had been broken up, over bricks, stones, and posts, mixed together confusedly."</P>
<P>A fine speech, like a fine lady, enforces atten∣tion, and captivates the heart. When it describes
<PB N="40" REF="024407_0433_0FC700DB5F9DC000"/>
pleasing objects, it is beautiful nature, dressed by the graces; when it soars in the sublime, it ele∣vates the soul, and animates the nobler passions: it gives to persuasion irresistible force, and bids the tear of pity fall, like the dew of heaven—gently fall—on virtue in distress.</P>

<HEAD>ON THE LEARNED LANGUAGES.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM sensible of the dangers and difficulties to which an orator exposes himself, who boldly ad∣ventures to oppose public prejudices, and contra∣dict established opinions, and yet without this li∣terary heroism, philosophic truth had never been brought to light. A rigid adherence to doctrines generally admitted, would have fixed us at this day in the errors of ancient systems, or have left us involved in the whimsical vortices of the modern <HI>Descartes.</HI></P>
<P>THE generality of mankind receive for truth, whatever may be handed to them as such, by those whom they have been accustomed to esteem as men of profound learning. They are not anxious to enquire for themselves; because enquiry is re∣plete with trouble, and it is much easier for them to adopt the opinions of others, than to form opi∣nions for themselves. Had astronomers told the multitude, that the sun is twice the distance, or but
<PB N="42" REF="024407_0435_0FC700DEC0536F60"/>
half the distance from the earth, that he is now supposed to be, it would have been so believed; not one in a million would have thought of de∣tecting the error by calculation. But woe to the man who attempts to unhinge the popular system! <HI>Galileo</HI> was imprisoned and persecuted for asserting that the earth revolved on its axis, and was com∣pelled publicly to renounce a truth of which he was fully convinced, and of which there is now no doubt remaining.</P>
<P>THESE preparatory observations I thought ne∣cessary, as an apology for the manner in which I propose to handle the subject assigned to me: to wit, <HI>the use and advantages of what are called the learned languages in the education of youth.</HI></P>
<P>THESE advantages ought, indeed, to be very great and manifest to compensate for the precious time spent in acquiring them. Let us, for a mo∣ment, if possible, lay aside former prejudices, and consider the subject with candour and im∣partiality.</P>
<P>THE benefits to be expected from the study of the dead languages, must, I think, flow from some or all of the following sources. It must either
<PB N="43" REF="024407_0436_0FC700E7AFA03320"/>
open a door of knowledge, to which there is no other means of access, or will polish the manners, and enrich the mind with ideas not otherwise to be acquired; or will serve as a key to all other languages, and become a vehicle of universal com∣munication.</P>
<P>WITH respect to the first I venture to assert, and think it will hardly be controverted, that there is no ancient author, Latin, Greek, or He∣brew; philosopher, historian, or poet, of any reputation, whose existing works have not been translated by able hands into most of the modern languages of Europe. So that there can be no knowledge contained in those works to which the reader of the present day may not have access by the easy medium of his native tongue. The trea∣sures of the ancients have been minutelv scrutiniz∣ed, and every article of value held up to public view, and faithfully reflected from the mirrours of modern languages.</P>
<P>NEITHER can I see, in the second place, how an acquaintance with the Latin, Greek, or Hebrew tongues should necessarily polish the manners, or enrich the mind with ideas not otherwise to be ac∣quired. Is there an inherent magic, a supernatu∣ral fecundity, in those ancient languages which
<PB N="44" REF="024407_0437_0FC700E88EBAA910"/>
modern modes of speech cannot boast? When a plain man reads in his Bible these words:
<Q>In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God;</Q>
has he not the same ideas suggested, and an equal comprehension of their meaning with the learned scholar when he teads in loftier tone, "<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>."—Surely there can be no difference. As to polishing the manners, a minute and technical knowledge of the learned languages hath an effect so notoriously to the contrary, that to call a man <HI>a mere scholar,</HI> is as much as to say, he has no manners at all.</P>
<P>BUT perhaps languages, like medals, acquire a value merely from their antiquity. If so, we ought to establish schools for teaching the Chinese tongue, which is certainly more ancient than either Latin or Greek, and, as some contend, than even the Hebrew itself. Look where we will for a dis∣tinguishing pre-eminence in these dead languages, such as may justify the great expence of time and study necessary to acquire them, and candour must acknowledge that such pre-eminence is not to be found.</P>
<P>BUT, says the third position, they serve as a key to all modern languages, and may be made a uni∣versal means of communication.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="024407_0438_0FC700E9EE7A1DF8"/>THE only purpose of language is to convey ideas. If modern speech does this, it is complete; if it does not, it is no language. What necessity then for a key? When a person says <HI>a house,</HI> or <HI>a man,</HI> is he not as well understood as if he should add, that the one was called <HI>domus,</HI> and the other <HI>homo,</HI> by the ancient Romans? <HI>Terms</HI> are altoge∣ther arbitrary; and general consent alone adapts them to the things they are designed to represent. And surely the general consent of the moderns is as respectable and valid as the general consent of the ancients. The truth is, there is no natural connection between <HI>words</HI> and <HI>things.</HI></P>
<P>IF such a connection was to constitute the per∣fection of a language, we must acknowledge, that the infant excels in propriety when he calls a sheep <HI>baa,</HI> or a dog <HI>bow-wow.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the Latin tongue, it is supposed, may serve as a universal means of communication between people of different nations. True; and so may any other language, if universally admitted and taught. The Latin tongue does not seem to be peculiarly and exclusively adapted to this purpose. For, notwithstanding that it has been inculcated with so much assiduity by innumerable private tutors, and public schools, for so many hundred years;
<PB N="46" REF="024407_0439_0FC700F0D76570E0"/>
yet the French, is at this day, a more universal language than the Latin. The experiment has been fairly made and urged to the extent; yet but few write in Latin, and fewer still use it as a me∣dium of conversation. As to Greek, it is no where in fashion but in the schools; and none but the Jews make use of the Hebrew. To what purpose then are so many years spent in acquiring these obsolete languages? Why, truly, that one in ten thousand may read ancient authors in the ori∣ginal, whilst the unhappy ten thousand must put up with faithful translations.</P>
<P>AN observation or two on the method of teach∣ing these learned languages shall close my speech on this occasion, which I perceive <HI>some</HI> think is already longer than it should be.</P>
<P>IT might seem strange to assert, that few teach∣ers of a language, according to the present mode of teaching, have any taste for its beauties or knowledge of its powers. And yet this is manifestly a general truth; accustomed, as they are, to treat it by detail, and hackneyed in a critical considera∣tion of its component parts, they, almost unavoida∣bly, lose all sense of its general effect, and become strangers to that spirit of expression, in which its principal elegance consists.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="024407_0440_0FC700F4536E6938"/>FOR the same reason, the pupil never acquires a true taste for the learned languages, till after he has been emancipated from the shackles of gram∣matical investigation.</P>
<P>TO teach a language by means of its grammar is beginning at the wrong end; for no language ever originated in a grammar: and what is worse, all the energy and spirit of a language must ne∣cessarily evaporate in a grammatical construction. Let us take an example from our own tongue. Suppose the following passage, from <HI>Mr Pope,</HI> to be put into the hands of a boy learning English.</P>
<L>"Heaven first taught letters for some wretch's aid,</L>
<L>"Some banish'd lover, or some captive Maid.</L>
<L>"They live, they speak, they breathe what love inspires</L>
<L>"Warm from the soul, and faithful to its fires:</L>
<L>"The virgin's wish, without her fears impart,</L>
<L>"Excuse the blush, and pour out all the heart;</L>
<L>"Speed the soft intercourse from soul to soul,</L>
<L>"And waft a sigh from Indus to the pole."</L>
<P>FORTHWITH the learned grammarian, and his industrious pupil, fall to work on these beatiful lines. They mince them without mercy into verbs and ad∣verbs, nouns and pronouns, substantives and adjec∣tives, gerunds, participles, articles and particles; and God knows what. But in this general laceration,
<PB N="48" REF="024407_0441_0FC700F5219C81E8"/>
What will become of the melody of the verse, the delicacy of sentiment, the elegance of ex∣pression, with many nameless graces, not defined in the rules of grammar? Alas! all would va∣nish in the scholastic process. As well might an anatomist dissect a living body, with a view to dis∣cover the nature and seat of the soul that ani∣mates it, as a grammarian to investigate the pow∣ers of a language, by resolving it into its com∣ponent parts.</P>
<P>BUT what would this author say, could he be a witness of such a chemical distillation of his charming lines? or what would <HI>Horace</HI> do, if he could be present in a modern school, and hear one of his elegant odes frittered into all the small ware of the syntax? What would he do? He would break the pupil's head, and put the tutor to death.</P>
<P>BUT my zeal for truth is hurrying me beyond the bounds of discretion; the time may come when teachers will be convinced that languages are not to be squared by rule and compass, as lands are surveyed; and that it is not necessary to search antiquity for the means of a reciprocal com∣munication of ideas; and that languages most in use, are, in truth, the most useful to be known.</P>

<HEAD>A REPLY TO THE FOREGOING SPEECH.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY fellow student has entertained you with a dissertation on the learned languages, and added some strictures on the method of teaching them in modern schools. He has handled the subject in his own eccentric way; and has, I doubt not, ob∣tained from this polite audience all the credit his ingenuity deserves.</P>
<P>BUT ingenuity is not truth; and false reasoning, however varnished with wit, is false reasoning still.</P>
<P>I shall not attempt to imitate my friend in the vivacity of his stile; but he must excuse me, if I endeavour to expose the fallacy of his argu∣ments▪ and rescue so considerable a branch of mo∣dern education from the obloquy his caprici∣ous humour hath been pleased to throw upon it.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="024407_0443_0FC700FE58A96A60"/>HAVING myself been duly fermented with gram∣matic froth; kneaded and moulded by the disci∣pline of the schools; baked, and as it were, pi∣ping hot from the classical oven, and incrusted with science, can I hear these slanders on the learned languages, which I have been so long ac∣customed to respect, and which I have acquired with so much painful study, and yet sit silent by? No! the fire of old Rome, and the spirit of Athens, will not brook such indignity.</P>
<P>THE first assertion, and indeed the ground on which he chiefly rests, is, that all ancient authors of any repute have been translated into the mo∣dern languages; from which he infers, that the originals are of no further use. He might with equal reason have said, because a shadow pro∣jects the true out lines of the substance, it is of equal value, and will answer the same purposes.</P>
<P>BUT there are numberless beauties to be disco∣vered by the scholar in the original, and a force and propriety arising from what is called the <HI>idiom</HI> of a language which no translation can convey: not only this, but the real meaning of the author, even in the original, is not always precisely as∣certained by the learned themselves—how then shall it be found in a translation?</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="024407_0444_0FC7010123B76EC0"/>TO prove this, we need only look at the volu∣minous notes upon Horace, or the various rea∣dings of Virgil, in which the most profound scho∣lars have differed in opinion; and about which they have disputed, confuted, and refuted each o∣ther time immemorial. What delightful obscuri∣ty! What glorious uncertainty! Will a translation furnish any thing like this? Surely not. The terms of a known and living language are too well understood to admit of much altercation. All is a dead or languid precision. The system, the the doctrines, the arguments of a modern author may be questioned and canvassed; but seldom his meaning, if he has any meaning at all.</P>
<P>THE great and excellent use of the learned lan∣guages consists, in my opinion, in the two follow∣ing particulars.</P>
<P>FIRST, They afford the moderns an inexhausti∣ble source of ingenious altercation and profound conjecture: and,</P>
<P>SECONDLY, By deriving the technical terms of every art and science from these languages, a mysterious obscurity is obtained which throws a veil over the face of truth, and screens the rays of of knowledge from vulgar eyes.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="024407_0445_0FC701072CF4D9A0"/>AS to the first; in the various readings of ancient authors, in notes, critical and explana∣tory, and in notes upon those notes, what a field is opened for profound erudition! And when the modern commentator finds himself hard pushed, it is but supposing an error to have crept into the text; it is but altering a letter or two, as occasion shall require, and he can make the original support his comment with all the seem∣ing reason in the world. And however a brother critic may dispute his conjectures, he is sure that the author himself will never come back to decide the contest and put him to shame. An obscene sentence will furnish a literary feast, and one half of a long Greek or He∣brew word has been sufficient to occa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on a schism, and give the world a new religious sect.</P>
<P>I know of no modern author so rich in this kind of learning as <HI>Shakespeare.</HI> He wrote on the verge of the old and modern English, and has so blended the idioms of the writers of his day, with those of their grandfather's, as to occasion much delightful uncertainty and ingenious com∣mentating. This, together with the incorrect manner in which his works have been handed to us, have afforded a glorious opportunity for guess-work: and <HI>Pope, Warburton, Theobald, Johnson,</HI>
<PB N="53" REF="024407_0446_0FC70108BB07C548"/>
and many others have exercised their talents ac∣cordingly.</P>
<P>BUT I hasten to the second advantage I men∣tioned as peculiar to the dead languages; to wit, that by deriving terms from them into the arts and sciences, a mysterious obscurity is obtained, which throws a veil over the face of truth, and screens the rays of knowledge from vulgar eyes.</P>
<P>WHEN the barbarous nations of the north over∣ran Europe, they obliterated almost; every trace of science: a few monks only were in possession of the seeds of learning, contained in the remaining works of ancient authors. When the day of knowledge again began to dawn, these manuscripts were held in great repute; and when printing was invented, copies of them were exceedingly mul∣tiplied. As these were then the sources of science, no man was esteemed learned, who had not stu∣died the languages in which they were written. Such was their use at that time: very different, but not less important, is their use at this day: by means of repeated translations, the treasures of the ancients have been laid open to public view. Science, divested of mystery, would lose its value, and men of learning forfeit that respect which the vulgar owe to profound erudition, were it not that
<PB N="54" REF="024407_0447_0FC7010A2BEE3B28"/>
the philosopher, the scholar, the man of science in every department, hath taken care to borrow a profusion of technical terms from the learned lan∣guages, which throws a mantle of mystery over his profession, and covers the secrets of his art from the admiring multitude: so that modern learning consists, not so much in the study of <HI>things,</HI> as in the knowledge of <HI>terms.</HI> The author of <HI>Hudibras</HI> very justly observes, that</P>
<L>"All a rhetorician's rules</L>
<L>"Teach nothing but to name his tools."</L>
<P>AND so it is, for the most part, in every science —and so it ought to be—for if it were otherwise; if the terms used by men of learning were given in the vulgar tongue, every body would understand them, and science soon become contemptible. For instance; a grave and learned physician thus in∣forms his patient:
<Q>Sir, your disorder is an <HI>an∣thrax,</HI> and I shall prescribe an emollient <HI>cata∣plasm.</HI></Q>
The poor man is filled with fear, won∣der, and respect: but had he been told in plain English—
<Q>You have got a boil, and must apply a poultice of bread and milk;</Q>
he would despise both the doctor and the disease.</P>
<P>IT is the Greek and Latin languages that fur∣nish
<PB N="55" REF="024407_0448_0FC7011094753A78"/>
these high sounding words, so singular to the ear, when the sense is concealed.</P>
<P>SOUNDS have a delightful effect upon the hu∣man mind; especially articulated sounds: and the effect is still more certain, when they have either no meaning at all, or the meaning is not under∣stood.</P>
<P>AN ignorant woman, weeping aloud under the influence of a powerful preacher, was asked the cause of her lamentation: Oh, sir! said she, don't you hear those charming words, <HI>Mesopotamia, Pam∣phylia,</HI> and <HI>Phrygia?</HI> And I knew a lady during the late war, who did not possess one political principle, or had any precise idea of the real cause of contest between Great-Britain and America, and yet was a professed and confirmed <HI>tory:</HI> merely from the fascination of sounds. The <HI>imperial crown,</HI> the <HI>royal robes,</HI> the <HI>high court of parliament,</HI> the <HI>lord chancellor of England,</HI> and so on, were words of irresistible influence. Whilst captain <HI>A,</HI> the taylor; colonel <HI>B,</HI> the tavern-keeper; and even <HI>general Washington,</HI> the farmer, only created con∣tempt. But I am persuaded, if some Indian chief, with a long Cherokee or Mohawk name, had com∣manded
<PB N="56" REF="024407_0449_0FC70113665A9E68"/>
our armies, she would have thought much more respectably of the American cause.</P>
<P>THIS being truth, and a truth founded in na∣ture, will any one pretend to say, that the Greek and Latin languages are of no use? What! shall we call things by downright vulgar English names? Shall not the physician have his <HI>paregorics</HI> and <HI>an∣tispasmodics;</HI>
his <HI>lenitives</HI> and <HI>sedatives;</HI> his <HI>anti∣phlogistics, cathartics,</HI> and <HI>diuretics?</HI> Shall not the lawyer have his <HI>fieri facias,</HI> his <HI>scire facias,</HI> and <HI>cer∣tiorares?</HI>
Or the divine his <HI>latitudinarians, millena∣rians, sublapsarians,</HI> and <HI>supralapsarians?</HI> Shall the chymist give up his hard words, and the botanist his technical terms, in the knowledge of which his whole science consists? Deplorable will be the state of erudition when this shall be the case. Know∣ledge, indeed, might encrease and become more u∣niversally diffused; but <HI>learning</HI> would be no more. We might then say, such a man is a man of <HI>genius,</HI> of <HI>wisdom,</HI> of <HI>understanding;</HI> but where should we find the man of <HI>profound erudition:</HI> one who would spurn at the simplicity of nature's works, and plunge in system, deeper than common sense could even fathom?</P>
<P>BUT thanks to our universities, colleges, aca∣demies,
<PB N="57" REF="024407_0450_0FC70115CA865600"/>
and schools; or rather thanks to the learned languages, which they so laboriously in∣culcate; such as aera, it may be presumed, is yet far distant.</P>

<HEAD><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This speech was was not delivered</NOTE> ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NEW CONSTITUTION FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have lately been entertained with an ex∣hibition, which, for novelty, splendor, and decorum justly merited universal admiration and applause. If, besides the magnificence of the thing itself, we take into consideration the important occasion that induced it, it must be acknowledged to have been an object most interesting and truly sub∣lime.</P>
<P>YOU will readily suppose, that I refer to the <HI>grand federal procession,</HI> performed in celebration of that memorable day which gave to our coun∣try <HI>freedom</HI> and <HI>independence</HI>; and also of the late
<PB N="63" REF="024407_0456_0FC70128E5E71C18"/>
happy establishment of a liberal and efficient go∣vernment, on which the future dignity and pros∣perity of America is to be founded.</P>
<P>TO give stability, energy, and respectability to go∣vernment—to concenter the strength of a nation for national purposes; and at the same time leave to the people at large a full security in, and enjoyment of, essential rights, is a problem in politics which has employed the pens of the most enlightened men in every civilized age and country; may we not hope that it was reserved for the genius of America to solve this difficult problem; and shew to the world a system of government possessing all the requisites which theory demands, and producing all the effects which can reasonably be expected from experiment?</P>
<P>THE circumstances under which our federal constitution hath been framed and established, are so new and unprecedented, that we may hope for new and unprecedented good consequences in its operation.</P>
<P>THE first outlines of most of the political sy∣stems of Europe were originally designated by the sword, not by the pen; were the fruits of con∣quest, or the offsprings of rude necessity, not the production of deliberate choice, the consequences
<PB N="64" REF="024407_0457_0FC70131CDDADC18"/>
are accordingly manifest. In some instances, an uneasy and restless submission under a constant sense of mutilated rights; in others, a total prostra∣tion of the majesty of the people, and adegradation dishonourable to human nature.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>here,</HI> the case hath been far otherwise. No successful hero hath, by chance of war, obtain∣ed a power to prescribe a mode of government to the people; but the people have by their valour obtained the right and the opportunity of fra∣ming a government for themselves: and this, not a barbarous and uninformed multitude; but a peo∣ple highly civilized, who know what government is, and what it ought to be; and who had before their eyes the experience of ancient times, and the present examples of the world.</P>
<P>THUS situated, and thus instructed, they selected, by a free choice, a competent number of tried pa∣triots and able statesmen, to frame for them a system of general government. In this vene∣rable body was concentered the wisdom and inte∣grity of a nation; not <HI>virtually</HI> only, but in <HI>truth</HI>
and in <HI>fact,</HI> if we consider individually the illu∣strious characters who composed the late general convention.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="024407_0458_0FC701332DC5B278"/>THIS honourable band of patriots, after the most mature deliberation, and after balancing all considerations, local and general, proposed a plan of national government to the attention of the people at large. This plan, by frequ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t pub∣lications, and numerous displays of its component parts, was brought, in effect, to the very door of every person interested in it. After which, by a second free election, persons were appointed in each of the states, to reconsider, and impowered to adopt or reject it, in the name, and on the be∣half of the states respectively. Under all these cautions, deliberations and scrutinies, the present government of the United States of America hath been ratified and confirmed by ten states, and thereby gained a legal establishment according to the terms proposed.</P>
<P>IT would be presumption in me to attempt to develope the properties, and probable effects, of a system which is the result of so much ripened judgement and combined wisdom; yet permit me to point out one striking feature in the object of our present admiration, which is, that as our government originated from, and has for its foun∣dation, the people at large; so, in the periodical renovations of all its component parts, recur∣rence is constantly had to the people at large;
<PB N="66" REF="024407_0459_0FC701342C3C6EB0"/>
and it contains within itself a constitutional right of amendment, when ever experience and concurring opinions, shall deem amendment necessary; circumstances sufficient in themselves to silence all objections. For the people have not given up to their rulers all power, with only a scanty reservation of enumerated privileges for themselves; but they have delegated enumera∣ted powers, reserving all their essential rights.</P>
<P>WHAT glory to our country, what happiness to the people, may not be expected under a go∣vernment so constituted! Already hath the voice of freedom invited many thousands of emigrants from nations beyond the seas: arts and manufac∣tures begin to raise their heads; and agriculture hath already begun to smile in the western wilder∣ness. These are the effects of freedom only; but how will these effects be encreased when it shall be known, that <HI>that</HI> freedom is secured and sub∣stantiated by a government whose essence is <HI>the rights of the people?</HI></P>
<L>"<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cience shall flour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh genius stretch her wing;</L>
<L>"In native strains Columbian muses sing;</L>
<L>"Wealth crown the arts, and justice poise her scales,</L>
<L>"Commerce her pondrous anchor weigh,</L>
<L>"Wide spread her sails,</L>
<L>"And in far distant seas her flag display."</L>
<P><PB N="67" REF="024407_0460_0FC70135A6E179D8"/>IF we consider the vast extent of our country, its variety of climate, its hidden treasures, and in∣numerable resources, and to crown all, its now established government, there seems to be no in∣gredient wanting to render us, in time, a great and happy nation. Without <HI>virtue,</HI> however, all the rest will be vain and fruitless. An abandoned and profligate people can never be happy: but, as it is manifest, that in other countries, the nature of the government, and the manners of the court, have a considerable influence on the morals of the peo∣ple, may we not hope that our excellent constituti∣on will afford a soil, on which the moral and chri∣stian virtues will grow, and flourish, and bring forth fruit in abundance?</P>
<P>THAT this constitution is the genuine choice of the people themselves, and not a government vio∣lently or fraudulently imposed upon them, has been evinced by general and unequivocal demon∣strations of joy on its establishment; by processions and festivity, in numberless cities, towns, and vil∣lages, throughout the United States; and by vo∣luntary exertions of industry <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">All the machinery exhibited in this grand procession was begun and completed between Monday morning and Thursday evening.</NOTE> and magnificence, which no compulsion could have produced. A
<PB N="68" REF="024407_0461_0FC7013ECD0FCBB8"/>
new aera is born to America, and the mighty voice of the people hath fixed the date.</P>
<P>IT cannot, I think, be thought improper that an event so great, so interesting, and so glorious, should be recognized in this annual solemnity of the university of Pennsylvania:—barely to recog∣nize it, is all my unexperienced abilities can pre∣tend to; but it has been, and will be, the subject of comment and admiration for those who are more adequate to the pleasing task: and will, I hope, and doubt not, be the source of innumerable bles∣sings to the present and succeeding generations, and the pride and glory of our rising empire.</P>

<HEAD>For the Pennsylvania Packet.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE perused with some attention the several addresses made to the venerable <HI>Doctor Franklin,</HI> by public bodies and private societies on his ar∣rival in this city. So far as they express a sense of gratitude and esteem for his integrity and abilities as a public agent and a philosopher, they have my hearty concurrence and approbation: but they also afford some literary amusement, when considered merely as compositions, with a design of observing the various forms which the same subject matter may assume, in passing through the varied machinery of different pericraniums.</P>
<P>TALKING on this subject with Mr. B. the ad∣dress of the American Philosophical Society enga∣ged our attention, as distinguished from all the others by a dearth of sentiment, awkwardness of stile, and obscurity of expression. I am surprised, said I—but it will be better to give it in the way of dialogue, to avoid a number of said <HI>I's</HI> and said <HI>he's.</HI></P>

<P>I am surprised that our Philosophical Soci∣ety, from whom we might expect, on such an occa∣sion, at lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e and propriety, if not something more, should exhibit so ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>n, so stiff and costive a performance, as their address seems to be: it must certainly have been seethed too long in the author's brain, and so become hard like an over-boiled egg.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I perceive, sir, you are not a member of the Philosophical Society.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>No sir, I have not that honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I thought by your mentioning <HI>brains.</HI> Why, sir, we never make use of any in writing letters, or drawing addresses: we manage these things in quite a different way. How do you ima∣gine our address was produced?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some member, I suppose, was appointed to draft the address, which was afterwards read be∣fore the society; and being corrected, was finally approved of, and so delivered.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>When you shall become a philosopher you will know better: no, sir, we conduct all our bu∣siness by ballot, as they choose magistrates—ac∣cording
<PB N="71" REF="024407_0464_0FC701494E44AA08"/>
to the spirit of our excellent consti∣tution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>No doubt—when new members, or officers of the institution are to be elected; but how an address can be composed by ballot, I confess, I can∣not comprehend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I will inform you. You must know we have four boxes: in one are put a number of <HI>substantives,</HI> the best the dictionary affords; in the second, an equal number of <HI>adjectives;</HI> in the third, a great number of <HI>verbs,</HI> with their <HI>partici∣ples, gerunds,</HI> &amp;c. and in the fourth, a still greater number of <HI>pronouns, articles,</HI> and <HI>particles,</HI> with all the small ware of the syntax. The secretary shakes these boxes for a considerable time, and then places them side by side on a table, each bearing its proper label of distinction. This done, the members proceed to ballot for the composition, whatever it may be; each member taking out one substantive, one adjective, two verbs, and four particles from the boxes respectively; and so they proceed, repeating the operation, until they have drawn the number of words, of which, according to a previous determination, the composition is to consist. Some ingenious member is then requested to take all the ballots or words so obtained, and
<PB N="72" REF="024407_0465_0FC7014B692E1570"/>
arrange them in the best order he can. In the present <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, this ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k fell to *****; and you can see how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e has worked up the materials which chance threw in his way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this is your method it will sufficiently ac∣count for the short broken sentences, the harshness of the periods, and general obscurity which distin∣guish your address.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean by <HI>obscurity?</HI> I am sure our address, if not elegant, is at least intelligible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, inform me then, what is meant by this paragraph?
<Q>The high consideration and esteem in which we hold your character, so intimately com∣bine with our regard for the public welfare, that we participate eminently in the general satisfaction which your return to America produces:</Q>—and of this—<Q>We derive encouragement and extra-ordinary felicity from an assemblage of recent memorable events: and while we boast in a most pleasing equality, permanently ascertain∣ed,</Q>
&amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>The meaning of your first quotation is, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> high consideration for the doctor, combining and intimately mixing with our regard for the pub∣lic
<PB N="73" REF="024407_0466_0FC7014CE93341A8"/>
welfare, occasion a kind of chymical solution or effervescence in our minds, producing a <HI>tertium quid,</HI> which causes us to <HI>participate eminently</HI>; and so on—if you know any thing of chymistry, you would have understood it well enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! it appears to me something very like nonsense: but I confess I am no philosopher.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to the other passage you mentioned— the truth is, we were a little unlucky—it would have been the most elegant paragraph in the whole composition but for an unfortunate accident. You must know, that whilst ***** was arranging the ballots, a puff of wind blew away a number of ex∣cellent explanatory words, and carried them out of the window; the whole sentence had like to have gone: a careful search was made in the street, but no more could be recovered than what you see. It was, indeed, proposed to ballot over again for as many words as had been lost: but some members were of opinion, that this might prove a dangerous precedent, and so the passage was suffered to pass as it now stands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I observe further, that you mention
<Q>the growth of <HI>sciences</HI> and <HI>arts;</HI></Q>
would it not have read better,
<Q>the growth of <HI>arts</HI> and <HI>sci∣ences,</HI></Q>
<PB N="74" REF="024407_0467_0FC70155C00F4A10"/>
according to the usual mode of expres∣sion? which has this to justify it, that arts were known and practised before <HI>sciences</HI> were investi∣gated; and besides, the expression is more musi∣cal and pleasing to the ear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>We had a long debate upon this subject; and the very reasons you now give were urged in favour of the common way of placing those words; but the learned compositor insisted, that as the <HI>sciences</HI> were more obstruse, and more eminent in dignity than the <HI>arts,</HI> they ought to be mentioned first, especially by a philosophical society.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>This reminds me of what the town clerk says, in Shakespeare's <HI>Much ado about nothing.</HI></P>
<P>"To. Cl. Write down that they hope they serve God: and be sure to write God first; for God defend, but God should go before such villians."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is in vain to attempt explanation to a mind so prejudiced as your's. I perceive you are determined to find fault, and so let us drop the subject.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, do you imagine I believe one word of your boxes and your ballots? You are either
<PB N="75" REF="024407_0468_0FC701576CCC1038"/>
ridiculing, or endeavouring to excuse, a perfor∣mance, which would indeed disgrace a school boy.</P>

<HEADNOTE>
<P>☞ BY an act of assembly passed in August or September, 1785, it was directed that at the general elections held in October, the poll should be closed precisely at 8 o'clock in the evening, under a pretence of preventing disorders; but, in fact, with a view to serve the purposes of a party <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Called the constitutional party.</NOTE> then in power. This occasioned the fol∣lowing publication. The law, however, took place at the then en∣suing election; but the effect turned out quite adverse to the design of those who framed it, and the law was soon afterwards repealed.</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<HEAD>TO THE FREEMEN OF PENNSYLVANIA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>FELLOW CITIZENS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN the 9<SUP>th</SUP> section of our constitution or frame of government it is written —<Q>The members of the house of representatives shall be chosen an∣nually by ballot, by the freemen of the common∣wealth, <HI>on the second Tuesday in October for ever.</HI></Q>
And in the last clause of the same section, is also written, that the general assembly—<Q>shall have no power to add to, alter, abolish, or <HI>in∣fringe</HI> any part of this constitution.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="024407_0470_0FC7015FA46CB8E8"/>NOW I say, and it is most manifest, that our late assembly have, not by implication, but directly and expressly, violated the constitution, and have a∣bridged and infringed the essential right intended to be secured by the 9<SUP>th</SUP> section.</P>
<P>THEY have passed a law declaring, that if a free man, however fully entitled to vote, shall come on the second Tuesday in October at 30 seconds after eight o'clock, and offer his ballot, it shall not be received; his right shall be forfeited; his vote shall be illegal, and of no effect—What! because I am old and infirm—because I have not strength to push through a croud, and force a pas∣sage through contending parties—because I am a peacable, modest man, and cannot kick <HI>constitutio∣nalists,</HI> and elbow <HI>republicans,</HI> out of my way, must I be disfranchised? must I be told—"Sir, you are too late—your vote is good for nothing."—I appeal to the constitution—see, here it is! It says I may vote on the second Tuesday in October— this is the second Tuesday in October—I am qualified to vote, and here is my ticket—<Q>You are mistaken, (say the judges and inspectors) this is not Tuesday—we are advanced 30 se∣conds upon Wednesday morning.</Q>
How can that be gentlemen? Is not a day at least 12 hours long?—some say 24 hours—<Q>Ay! it
<PB N="78" REF="024407_0471_0FC701637A582C28"/>
used to be so formerly; but the act of assem∣bly has altered that matter, and made the second Tuesday in October but six hours long, viz. from 2<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The election seldom opened before two.</NOTE> to 8 o'clock.</Q>
But, pray gentle∣men, here are 40, here are 50, here a hundred citizens want to give in their votes. We are come to exercise the right of freemen; the right our constitution has given us, according to law— according to the 9<SUP>th</SUP> section of our frame of go∣vernment; and we think the assembly cannot de∣prive us of this right—"No matter: what signi∣fies what you think? Here is the law; read it; you must be disfranchised for this year at least— you have committed an unpardonable offence— you have forfeited your right—you have come 30 seconds after 8 o'clock—Go! Go home! eat hearty, and become stout and strong—learn to box, to push, to kick, to swear, to wrangle and scramble, and next year, perhaps, you may stand some chance, but you must not complain now —the law is equitable—it is as good for <HI>constitu∣tionalist</HI> goose, as for <HI>republican</HI> gander—ei∣ther party may have the benefit of it; but the strongest will prevail." But, gentlemen, for God's sake! I am neither a goose nor a gander; I only want to vote. "Away! Away! we will hear no
<PB N="79" REF="024407_0472_0FC70165AAB18508"/>
more; the act of assembly shuts the door in your face."</P>
<P>BUT, seriously, I look upon this abridgement of the time of voting as a dangerous innovation and direct violation of the constitution. It is calculated to serve party purposes, and to secure the present reigning influence in the seats of power.</P>
<P>LET me suppose a case, not impossible or extra∣vagant—may I not say, not improbable—Suppose a set of judges, or inspectors, or a majority of ei∣ther, to be strong in the interests of a particular party—Suppose a number of voters of the same party to be collected together, to go early to the place of election, and take possession of all the ave∣nues—will it not be in the power of these judges and inspectors to create what delays they please? to institute scrupulous and tedious enquiries? to make many mistakes, and to be very nice and ac∣rate in rectifying these mistakes? in short, by a thousand artifices, not easily detected, so to spend the time allotted, that others may have little or no chance left? Let the proceedings of next Tuesday be well watched: for myself, I am no party man; but I have impartially considered the conduct of those in power, and have found it such as ought to
<PB N="80" REF="024407_0473_0FC70167648DF8A0"/>
alarm the cool and dispassionate freemen of the commonwealth.</P>
<P>HA<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>E they not made the constitution a stalking horse to cover their sinister designs? Have they not moulded, and expounded, and twisted it every way (as lord Peter did his father's will) for the advancement of their ambitious views? Have they not reversed and abolished charters without legal cause? Have they not passed <HI>ex post facto</HI> and par∣tial laws, either to serve those they did, or to pu∣nish those they did not like? And have they not by their late law disfranchised many hundred citizens of their right to vote at the general elec∣tion? They certainly have—for I am confident, that let the inspectors, clerks, &amp;c. be ever so in∣dustrious and impartial, it is impossible that a con∣tested election can be fairly completed within the time prescribed, viz. from two to eight o'clock; and that, if an account should be taken through∣out the state, of those who will be <HI>necessarily</HI> ex∣cluded from voting by this law, they will amount to many hundreds. Heretofore, elections have been known to continue two or three days, and the closing of the poll was never attempted till all had a full and fair opportunity. But it seems to be a general scramble now—first come
<PB N="81" REF="024407_0474_0FC7016EA56326D8"/>
first served—and wo to your eight o'clock gen∣try.</P>
<P>THE charter and estates of the college were forcibly wrested from the rightful possessors; be∣cause, as it was said, the trustees had many years ago passed a rule which seemed to narrow the foun∣dation of that institution: and yet the same men, who were then such rigorous observers of origi∣nal institutions, can now abridge the time allowed by our frame of government for voting at general elections, and arbitrarily cut away at least one half of that time—and this shall be no offence at all—Lord Peter will expound the constitution, and make all right.</P>
<P>IF my fellow-citizens see this matter in the light I do, they will bring this law to the test, by making the following experiment:—let three or four re∣spectable citizens (having an indisputable right to vote) in each or any of the counties, reserve their tickets till some short time after eight o'clock, and then offer them to the proper officers in the pre∣sence of witnesses. If their votes should be refu∣sed, as they probably will, let a suit be instituted, and so bring the question to a legal issue: I am persuaded there is no court but will adjudge the act to be illegal and of no force, as to this clause,
<PB N="82" REF="024407_0475_0FC7016F66458410"/>
because the constitution is paramount to any act of assembly; and it expressly declares, that the free∣men of the state may vote on the second Tuesday in October for ever.</P>
<P>IF the assembly have a right to limit the time of voting to eight o'clock, they have the same right to fix it at seven, or six, or three: and so some future assembly may take from us the right of voting al∣together, by making the period so short, that, by the time the clerks have ruled their books and mended their pens, the golden moments may elapse, and the minutes of grace pass away.</P>
<P>A curious question in law.—Does the act mean <HI>true</HI> or <HI>apparent</HI> time? For the sun will on that day be 12 minutes too fast: be this as it may, it will be very proper that the state-house clock should be cleaned, and put under good regulation, previous to the election, and that it should be set with great accuracy on the morning of the day (if any morn∣ing can be allowed to a day of six hours) by some sworn artist, and in the presence of the judges. But I don't know what they will do in the coun∣try, where there are no public clocks: the watches of the judges may happen to go a little too fast, or too slow, according to their judgment of the run of votes. For, let me observe, that ten or a dozen
<PB N="83" REF="024407_0476_0FC7017216842518"/>
additional votes may be of the greatest importance in a contested election, and change the political complexion of the state.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The effect of this law (as was before observed) turned out con∣trary to the expectation of the constitutional party who framed it. At the ensuing election, it was manifest when eight o'clock drew near, that the run of votes had been in favour of the republican tick∣et: soon afterwards a strong body of the constitutionalists came up to vote, but the clock struck, and it was insisted that the election should be closed according to the law. The chief-justice (M'Kean) who was on the ground, was consulted on the occasion, and he gave his opinion, that the election might he kept open for another hour, <HI>to allow for the variation of watches:</HI> but no attention was paid to such an absurd opinion: the doors were closed with great shoutings, and the republican ticket was successful.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>A WORD OF ADVICE: OR THE PENNSYLVANIA ASSEMBLYMAN'S VADE-MECUM.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH the constitution of Pennsylva∣nia, amongst other good things, enjoins that the people should choose men <HI>most noted for wisdom,</HI> to represent them in general assembly; yet as electors are not always so attentive to this injunction as they should be, it may be presumed that in so promiscuous a body as our general assembly, composed of men collected from every part of the state, there may be some, to whom a word or two of instruction may not be amiss. To such, if any such there should be in our present assembly, the following rules of legislative conduct are submitted.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="85" REF="024407_0478_0FC70178E8F4C1A8"/>1<SUP>st</SUP>. You are to consider your election into the general assembly of the state, as one of the most important events of your life; because the powers with which the constitution hath invested you, and the duties of your station, are of the most extensive and serious consequences: no less than to bear a part in the framing and establishing of laws, which are to bind the citizens of this great common∣wealth: and therefore,</P>
<P N="2">2<SUP>d</SUP>. You are to consider yourself not merely a member for the county which elected you, but a representative of the state at large; consequent∣ly, should the supposed particular interests of that county come in competition with the general in∣terests of the state, you should not hesitate in giv∣ing it up: for the public good should be the polar star of your conduct. Members of assembly are too apt to think, that if by their vote or influence they can screen the county in which they live from a share of the public burthen, or procure for it some extraordinary privilege, they will merit great applause from their neighbours, whom they sup∣pose their only constituents. But such narrow principles dishonour the seat of legislation. A com∣monwealth is one body politic: its division into counties is artificial, and for convenience in the ad∣ministration of justice, and other good purposes;
<PB N="86" REF="024407_0479_0FC7017B857ADCD0"/>
but the true interests of each, and of the whole, are inseparable. Should members of assembly accus∣tom themselves to think otherwise, and boast of advantages gained for a particular county at the expence of the general good, it would be, as if the left hand should boast, that it had cunningly con∣trived to make the right hand do the most work. If you ought not to consider yourself as the repre∣presentative only of a particular county; much less are you to suppose that it is your duty to support, at all events, the interests and influence of a designated party. Such a conduct would be a direct violation of your oath of office.</P>
<P N="3">3<SUP>d</SUP>. THE people have vested you <HI>personally</HI> with the power of legislation, and you cannot delegate or assign that power to any other person or per∣sons whatever. Your constituents look for the exercise of <HI>your</HI> judgment, and for <HI>your</HI> vote foun∣ded thereon, and not for another's through you. Attend to arguments and opinions, within and without; make full use of every means that may inform your understanding: but when you come to give your vote, let that vote be purely and strict∣ly your own. It would be a wicked prostitution of the trust reposed in you, should you, by any compact with a select number of your brethren, bind yourself to give your voice contrary to your
<PB N="87" REF="024407_0480_0FC7017CEA5B3360"/>
judgement: for instance, should you hold private meetings with such select members, and engage with them to give your <HI>aye</HI> or <HI>nay</HI> in the general assembly, on a question to be agitated, according to the determination of a majority of this private assembly,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A known practice of the constitutional party.</NOTE> this would be a very serious and dan∣gerous offence—an offence for which you might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e impeached and disgraced.</P>
<P N="4">4<SUP>th</SUP>. As the people expect to be governed by laws of your making, it is highly improper to apply to the judges of the supreme court to frame bills for you, or to revise bills already framed; except in cases of mere technical knowledge. Judges should have nothing to do with the making of laws, which they are afterwards to explain and execute. It is a determined maxim in politics, that the legis∣lative and executive powers of government should be kept carefully separate and distinct. How very improper would it be, should a judge, in explaining a disputed point of law, have it in his power to say —I know the intention of the legislature to have been thus, or thus, <HI>for I myself framed and drew this law.</HI> It is always dangerous to suffer the judges to tamper with the laws of the land, in any stage of their process, either in the making or pub∣lishing them. Much better would it be for the
<PB N="88" REF="024407_0481_0FC70189EAC89360"/>
people to receive the laws pure from the source of legislation, even though a few technical errors should sometimes occur, than to submit them to be <HI>revised, corrected,</HI> and <HI>amended</HI> by the learning of the bench, especially in a constitution which admits but of one branch of legislature. Should an oc∣casion happen wherein the house would wish to be informed on a mere point of law, the proper way is, to state queries in writing, and send them to the judges for their answer: but on no account should a bill of the house be submitted to their correction. The judges already have a very formidable influ∣ence in the execution of the laws: if, by custom, they should acquire a like influence over the mak∣ing of them, the people would be exposed to all the dangers of an absolute government, without even the small security of responsibility. If the same officious hands are to cook the broth, and make us sup it, we shall soon have reason to complain of scalded mouths and sick stomachs.</P>
<P N="5">5<SUP>th</SUP>. As it is of the greatest importance that the acts of the legislature, and the minutes of the house, should be preserved pure and unadul∣terated, it may not be amiss to keep a watch∣ful eye over the clerk of the house, as it is much in his power to play tricks with the laws, minutes, and papers of the assembly, should he be so dispo∣sed.
<PB N="89" REF="024407_0482_0FC7018B3A6CD150"/>
To prevent this, it is your duty to see that the laws, as soon as enacted, are faithfully and im∣mediately lodged in the roll's-office, and upon no no account suffer the clerk to take them to his own lodgings. After the seals have been affixed to a law, the house, or a committee of the house, should never lose sight of it, till it is safely lodged with the recorder.</P>
<P>You should also take care that the votes of the house are, in due time, entered fairly on the book of minutes, and compared with the rough drafts; and that the printed copies be compa∣red with, and corrected by, the fair entries; <HI>and not the fair entries made from the printed Minutes.</HI></P>
<P>You should frequently inspect the files of the house to see that the papers are properly arran∣ged and endorsed; for this will enable you to detect the clerk in case he should attempt to with∣draw, secret, or destroy any of the papers entrus∣ted to his care. And it would not be a miss if you should now and then take up a return, peti∣tion, or other paper, which the clerk hath been reading to the house, to see whether he has given it a faithful reading or not. These attentions are proper, can give no just cause of offence, and will keep the clerk strictly in his duty.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="90" REF="024407_0483_0FC7018CAC9DB120"/>6<SUP>th</SUP>. There are some members in every assembly who are not qualified to make a figure on the floor. These may nevertheless well answer the purpose of their appointment, and discharge the trust reposed in them, by a conscientious exercise of judgement, firmness of mind, and integrity in voting. There are others who can add to these qualities the talents of eloquence, reasoning, and persuasion. Should you be of the former de∣scription, give all possible attention to the argu∣ments urged for and against the point in question; but in order to guard against the impositions of sophistry, the fallacy of which you may not have ingenuity enough to detect, together with the ar∣guments, take into consideration the character of the speaker. If you have observed and know him to be a man of an open, candid, and independent spirit, you may with the more safety yield to the impressions his eloquence shall make; but if you have reason to believe that he is subtle, selfish, and crafty, or that he is either the tool or the ring leader of a party, hear him with jealousy, and risk no more than what strong conviction will justify. At all events, let no reasoning, however ingeni∣ous, induce you to give your vote contrary what you <HI>feel</HI> and believe to be for the promotion of ge∣neral justice and the public good. There is in
<PB N="91" REF="024407_0484_0FC7018E39432248"/>
every good mind an internal sense of right and wrong, which you may safely depend upon, even though your understanding should not be highly illuminated: and it will be better to run the risk of an error of judgement than not to vote ac∣cording to this internal sense. There cannot be a more contemptible situation, than for a man so highly intrusted to resign himself implicitly to the government of another in the very business for which he was so intrusted. Since the public voice has placed confidence in you, you ought to have confidence in yourself.</P>
<P>SHOULD you be one of those who are accu∣stomed to public speaking, and qualified to take a part in the debates of the house, guard against a habit of opposition, which may insensibly grow upon you. In questions of trivial importance be content with voting according to your judgement, and reserve your powers of elocution for great occasions. Let not the vigour of debate ever push you beyond the bounds of civility, or induce you to infringe the rules of the house; and never suffer your temper to be unhinged—If you do, your opponent will gain an advantage over you, which perhaps, neither the subject of debate, nor his arguments thereupon, would have given him.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="024407_0485_0FC7019951472FF0"/>LASTLY—Never suffer a desire of displaying your abilities, nor a thirst for victory in debate, to lead you astray from what ought to be the ultimate object of the official conduct of every member of the legislature—<HI>The promotion of general justice and of the public good.</HI></P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON THE BILL ENTITLED "AN ACT FOR AMENDING THE PENAL LAWS OF THIS STATE."</HEAD>
<P>THE bill published for consideration, entitled
<Q>an act for amending the penal laws of this state,</Q>
will probably be taken up before long, in order to be passed into a law.</P>
<P>So great a revolution in the municipal law of our country, ought not to take place without due consideration on the part of the legislature, and such attention to the subject by the citizens at large, as the importance of it seems to require.</P>
<P>I have daily looked for some strictures on this bill in our public papers, and am surprised to find that it hath hitherto passed unnoticed. When∣ever a public act is likely to interfere with the in∣terests or views of any set of men, or party, all hands go to work, and we are distracted with ar∣guments <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con;</HI> but measures which have
<PB N="94" REF="024407_0487_0FC7019BAC35D730"/>
not that immediate tendency, however replete with remote mischief, are too frequently neglect∣ed, although a little timely exertion might prevent evils which, when they arrive, cannot easily be removed.</P>
<P>A report has been lately made to the house, recommending an abridgement of the fees and sa∣laries of public officers. Immediately the whole fraternity is in an uproar—the craft—the craft is in danger! At the head of the malecontents, with solemn step and stately stride, appears the pro∣found and formidable <HI>Jurisperitus,</HI> sounding forth his own praise, as with a brazen trumpet, and loudly descanting on his vast abilities and un∣paralleled services. One might suppose, from his account, that if the gentlemen at present in office should be affronted, and throw up their commis∣sions, the whole commonwealth could not furnish another set of equal wisdom, integrity, and sound whiggism.</P>
<P>THE lamentable outcry of <HI>Jurisperitus</HI> has led me to consider the bill under consideration, only in one point of view, viz. the enormous power it will vest in the judges of the supreme court, in ad∣dition to those other powers which have been
<PB N="95" REF="024407_0488_0FC7019D334342B0"/>
from time to time accumulating in their hands. Let us look at the list which <HI>Jurisperitus</HI> hath himself enumerated.</P>
<P>BESIDES the great power and influence neces∣sarily attendant on the office of chief justice—
<Q>he is, by vitue of that office, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He should have said by virtue of special acts of assembly, or an ordinance of congress.</NOTE> judge in the high court of errors and appeals; a judge of the court of admiralty sessions for the United States of America; a judge of the court of admiralty sessions for this state, and a trustee of the uni∣university. He is also to decide upon all claims against estates forfeited to the commonwealth, and the forfeiting persons; and has power to perpetuate testimony; take care of the persons and estates of ideots and lunaticks; and is to de∣termine all causes relating to alimony and di∣vorce.</Q>
To this catalogue our present assem∣bly have added an act to empower the justices of the supreme court to supply defects in the titles to lands, occasioned by the loss of deeds, &amp;c. and the now proposed bill for amending the penal laws, will give them a power to punish criminals ac∣cording to their discretion, within the limits of fourteen years cruel servitude.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="024407_0489_0FC6FD0377C6AFC0"/>WHEN we consider the sum total of power, and of course of influence, thus insensibly accumulating in the hands of two or three individuals, it seems highly expedient that government should not only avoid further delegations of special powers; but keep a watchful eye over the exercise of those al∣ready delegated.</P>
<P>THERE is not, in our system of jurisprudence, a more formidable body of operative power than that vested in the judges of the supreme court. The executive council, and house of assem∣bly, are composed of many individuals, and these liable to annual changes; but the judges are few in number, and permanent in office for seven years at least, and hold their commissions, as <HI>Jurisperitus</HI>
observes, in fact, during good behaviour. The exact time at which a judge's commission expires, is not matter of public notoriety: when this hap∣pens, it may be renewed in so secret and speedy a manner by his friends in council, that before those who may have been injured by mal-administration can make complaint, or the people have an oppor∣tunity of expressing their disgust, if any there should be, the judge is re-instated, and then no dog must bark. Excessive power has a natural tendency to debauch the best disposition; but when it falls into the hands of a proud, capricious, and ambi∣tious
<PB N="97" REF="024407_0490_0FC6FD064CD16EE0"/>
man, its operation should be watched with a jealous eye.</P>
<P>THE effect of the proposed alteration in the pe∣nal laws, will be to invest the judges of the su∣preme court with a <HI>discretionary</HI> power to punish within certain limits. This is, in fact, vesting them with legislative authority within those limits. It is a distinguishing mark of a free government, that the people shall know before hand, the penal∣ty which the laws annex to every offence; and, therefore, such a system is called a government of of laws, and not of men. But within the scope of the present bill, no offender can tell what his pu∣nishment is to be, till after conviction. The <HI>quan∣tum,</HI> at least, is to be determined by the particular state of mind the judge happens to be in at the time of passing sentence. Vexations and disap∣pointments may send his honour to court in a ve∣ry ill humour, and then wo to the culprits.</P>
<P><Q>THE knowledge of this part of jurisprudence (says Blackstone, vol. IV. p. 2.) which teaches the nature, extent, and degrees of every crime, and adjusts to it its adequate and necessary pe∣nalty, is of the utmost importance to every in∣dividual in the state. For, (as a very great
<PB N="98" REF="024407_0491_0FC6FD07612FB658"/>
master of the crown law <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Foster.</NOTE> has observed upon a similar occasion) no rank or elevation in life, no uprightness of heart, no prudence or circum∣spection of conduct, should tempt a man to con∣clude that he may not at some time or other be deeply interested in these researches. The in∣firmities of the best amongst us, the vices and un∣governable passions of others, the instability of all human affairs, and the numberless unforeseen events which the compass of a day may bring forth, will teach us, upon a moment's reflection, that to know <HI>with precision</HI> what the laws of our country have forbidden, and the deplorable consequences to which a wilful disobedience may expose us, is a matter of universal con∣cern</Q>—<Q>The criminal law (p. 3.) should be founded upon principles which are <HI>permanent, uniform,</HI> and <HI>universal.</HI></Q></P>
<P>HOW seriously applicable these maxims and ob∣servations are in a government, which, from the nature of its constitution, must ever be exposed to the virulence of contending parties, will be ob∣vious to every one. Under such a government, no judge should be trusted with <HI>discretionary</HI> pow∣er in the administration of penal law. There is sufficient reason to believe, that a scarlet robe is
<PB N="99" REF="024407_0492_0FC6FD0DD1F68E78"/>
not a certain security against the operation of par∣ty influence, petulence of temper, or an ambitious thirst of power.</P>
<P>THERE is no reading the bill in question, with∣out observing, that the burthen of the song is, <HI>the discretion of the court;</HI> such and such crimes shall be punished with a servitude not exceeding fourteen years, <HI>at the discretion of the court;</HI> such others, not exceeding seven years, <HI>at the discretion of the court;</HI> and so on, in almost every section. And, finally, the 15<SUP>th</SUP> section gives to these <HI>discreet</HI>
judges a power to determine on the reformation of the punished party, and to grant or refuse him, at their discretion, a certificate, announcing to all men, that he is actually so reformed. Which certificate is to operate as a legal <Q>discharge from all claims and demands of the party injured, and also as a pardon of the guilt and infamy of the offence, and give the party a new capacity and credit.</Q>
The thing would have been com∣plete if the act had given these demi-gods a power of granting religious absolution, as well as tempo∣ral restoration.</P>
<P>THERE are some crimes of such infamy, that the stain is not wiped off by the party's suffering the penalty of the law. One who has stood in
<PB N="100" REF="024407_0493_0FC6FD1117180878"/>
the pillory for perjury, cannot afterwards serve on a jury. But the effect of a pardon is to restore him, in the eye of the law, to the same credit he had before the accusation (except only in cases where the blood is attainted). The power of pardon is lodged, in England, (other than in cases of im∣peachment) exclusively in the crown: and, in Pennsylvania in the executive council. But, by this bill, the power of pardon, after punishment, is vested in the same men who awarded the penalty— a power incompatible with the genius of the common law, or the common rules of political prudence.</P>
<P>THE common law of England abhors the trust∣ing judges with a discretionary dispensation of pu∣nishments; most of the instances wherein they are so intrusted are by virtue of special acts of par∣liament, and ought to be considered as exceptions to the general rules of common law. This reli∣ance on the discretion of judges cannot safely be extended to matters of so serious import, as the awarding a severe and disgraceful servitude within the large limits of fourteen days to fourteen years; and afterwards granting a pardon, with all its legal operations, or with-holding it, according to the ca∣price of the judge, who, like our present chief jus∣tice, may be only <HI>a man,</HI> and not <HI>a God,</HI> not∣withstanding
<PB N="101" REF="024407_0494_0FC6FD12088F0E28"/>
the inherent virtues of his com∣mission.</P>
<P>I am far from objecting to the general intent of this bill: I think, with the assembly, that the Bri∣tish criminal law, which hath hitherto been our model, is by much too sanguinary, and has an∣nexed punishments to crimes in very undue pro∣portions—proportions not drawn from policy, reason, or equity. But this bill, if passed into a law, will make the matter worse than before. I acknowledge, that under the system proposed by this bill, a discretionary power must be lodged somewhere, and think it can no where be lodged so safely as with the jury who find the fact. The proportion of punishment, equitably due according to the nature of the offence, is not a question in∣volved in the technical subtleties of the law; but arises from the particular circumstances of the case, all things considered; and an honest, impar∣tial, and conscientious jury, are as competent to this purpose, as the most profound judge. They will necessarily have heard the state of the whole matter, with the arguments for the prosecution, and in behalf of the prisoner; and being a tempo∣rary body, accidentally brought together, and im∣pannelled for the occasion, are more likely to do substantial justice, than a judge who is so hackneyed
<PB N="102" REF="024407_0495_0FC6FD14D84E6980"/>
in criminal prosecutions, as to consider a citizen accused and not convicted, as a cause stifled, <NOTE PLACE="foot">Vide Vol. I. p. 202.—Ibid. p. 205.</NOTE> or lost to the commonwealth.</P>
<P>IF juries were so entrusted, they would proba∣bly hold their office in higher estimation than they do now: they would spurn at the idea of their being <NOTE PLACE="foot">Vide Vol. I. p. 202.—Ibid. p. 205.</NOTE> <HI>legal machines,</HI> subject to the management of the court: and feeling themselves competent to the business, would execute their duty with dignity, propriety, and good conscience.</P>
<P>As juries determine the <HI>quantum</HI> of damage in a civil action, there seems to be no reason why they should not also determine the <HI>quantum</HI> of pu∣nishment in a criminal process, within such li∣mits as the law shall prescribe.</P>
<P>WHY should the legislature assign so large and dangerous a field of power to judges, because of their supposed law knowledge, in a matter where law knowledge can be of no possible use? For, after the fact has been fairly found, the subtleties of law are at an end, at least they have nothing to do with the intrinsic demerit of the offence.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="024407_0496_0FC6FD161CE0EDD8"/>I have been told, and I believe it is so, that one of the judges framed this bill; no wonder then that the chorus of the song should be—<HI>at the dis∣cretion of the court:</HI> I wish they would get the court of admiralty to set these pleasant words to music; it would delight their honours much, if they have any ears for music, but I am told they have none; they would, however, strain hard to bear a bob in the burthen of so charming a song.</P>
<P>REASONABLE objections may perhaps be made to the vesting even a jury with such enormous power. If so, I cannot see why the general in∣tent of the bill may not be answered by annex∣ing to the several crimes, as heretofore defined in law, periods of servitude, fixed and ascertained according to enormities of their respective offen∣ces; and so make our penal laws less sanguinary. If the portionment of punishment should not in all instances be strictly equitable, they will at least be <HI>certain</HI> and <HI>known;</HI> and council may par∣don or reprieve, in particular cases, when circum∣stances shall make such an interference proper and just.</P>
<P>I sincerely wish this subject may be taken up by some abler hand. It is time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o be alarmed at the vast power gradually accum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ting in the hands of
<PB N="104" REF="024407_0497_0FC6FD1CE5383E78"/>
two or three individuals. When we see judges becoming professed and busy partymen: when we see them constantly interfering in the business of the legislature: influencing members of assem∣bly: drawing reports for committees, and framing bills for the house: usurping jurisdiction not gi∣ven them by law: expounding acts of assembly with dictatorial authority at improper times, and in improper <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At the general election in October last the chief justice, expounding the law to the judges of the election, told them that although the law directed the business to be closed, and the doors to be shut, at eight o'clock, yet they might go on till nine, <HI>to allow for the varia∣ion of watches.</HI></NOTE> places; and working every engine to promote their own power and influence—I say, when we see these things, we see <HI>symptoms</HI> of a growing tyranny, strong as <HI>Bunbury's symptoms of horsemanship</HI>: we see that the discretion of such men ought not to be so largely trusted. If this act should take place, the form of our government will in effect be changed—It will no longer be <HI>republican</HI> it will be <HI>despotic,</HI> at least within the field of criminal jurisprudence, which is a large and important field. For what is depotism? but a discretionary use of power, without being legal∣ly amenable for the just exercise of it. In this situation will our judges be by virtue of this act. For who shall call them to account? If they
<PB N="105" REF="024407_0498_0FC6FD1F5E3CB518"/>
should award one man four weeks, and another fourteen years punishment for the same offence— for a crime of the same enormity, under all cir∣cumstances, will an action lie against them, or can they be impeached for the injustice? Surely not—The legislature having vested them with <HI>discretionary</HI> powers, they will be the sole judges of that discretion.</P>
<P>IT is time to look about—Our assemblies have been too much disposed to look upon the supreme court as a reservoir for all power, which they knew not where else to lodge. Let them take care that this reservoir does not overflow, and de∣luge them, with their rights and liberties.</P>
<P>I hope my fellow citizens will see the danger of the proposed act for amending the penal laws of the state: that these observations will induce some other hand to take up the subject; and that every one will join in checking the exorbitant power of the supreme court</P>

<HEAD>For the Pennsylvania Packet.</HEAD>
<P>I OBSERVE by the paper of this day, that Wed∣nesday next is appointed by our house of assembly for taking up the bill called <HI>the penal law,</HI> which has been published for consideration, and is now ripe for the forms of legislation. This bill seems to be of very serious importance in the jurisprudence of our commonwealth. Innovations are always to be suspected, and prudence dictates that novel∣ties, under the guise of improvement, should be strictly scrutinized, lest an ostensible benefit should serve as an introduction to many overballancing evils. But I trust that our representatives will proceed with proper caution in a measure which will not only change the long established system of penal laws, but will, in effect, amount to a transfer of the great power of apportioning punishments to crimes from the sovereignty of the state, where it certainly ought to be, to two or three individuals, where it certainly ought not to be.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="024407_0500_0FC6FD27F977BF08"/>I heartily approve of the general purpose of this bill, in making penal laws less sanguinary, by sub∣stituting periods of disgraceful labour in the room of fatal executions and corporal punishments; but in as much as it leaves the apportionment of these periods to the discretion of the supreme court, it is a bill pregnant with dangerous conse∣quences, and establishes a despotic form of go∣vernment within the field of its operation. For, true despotism is nothing more than a power to punish according to will and pleasure.</P>
<P>TRUE it is, that our legislature still reserves the right of ascertaining the crime; but if the degree of punishment is to be determined by the will of the court, it may not be long before some learned judge will enlarge on the inconvenience of the le∣gislature's troubling itself with such matters, and prepare a bill for investing himself, and his bre∣thren, with the whole dispensation of criminal law.</P>
<P>IN a government like ours, it is highly necessary to be watchful over the movements of those in whom we confide—much more so than in go∣vernments less free; because those in whom we trust have the all powerful sanction of the people at large for whatever they do within the precincts
<PB N="108" REF="024407_0501_0FC6FD29548547D8"/>
of legal power, and it is certainly within these limits to ruin us according to law.</P>
<P>OUR assembly have undoubtedly a right to enact this bill into a law—Let us indulge imagi∣nation in, at least, possible consequences should it be enacted.</P>
<P>OUR judges have unavoidably an official in∣fluence over the petit jury in criminal trials. They also recommend to council for pardon, when they think fit, and the council not only ne∣ver execute against their recommendation; but, as I am told, seldom pardon without it. And now, by this bill, they are to be empowered by law to apportion punishments to crimes according to their own discretion. By their means the severi∣ties of law and the high prerogative of mercy will be vested in the same individuals—In men subject to passions and prejudices, are unfit to be so highly trusted.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE a case—<HI>A</HI> and <HI>B</HI> have committed precisely the same offence, viz. Burglary. <HI>A</HI> has respectable connections and friends; <HI>B</HI> has none. <HI>A</HI>'s friends are not only respectable, but they happen to be of the same party in the politicks of the state with his honour: or they belong to
<PB N="109" REF="024407_0502_0FC6FD2C6A74DDB0"/>
the same religious congregation. <HI>B</HI> is a foreigner; he has no friends or connections; or, if he has, they are of the adverse party to the judge—may we not suppose the discretion of the court would exercise itself very differently with respect to these criminals, however equal their demerits? A few days may serve to expiate the crime of <HI>A</HI>; but <HI>B</HI> must labour fourteen years for not having better friends and more powerful influence in his fa∣vour. This may seem too strong a case; but it is no more than what the law will justify. Any speci∣ous reasons for such a discrimination will be suffici∣ent to excuse the judges as men, for what they may do as officers, under the law.</P>
<P>IF it did not appear from the face of this bill that it is a direct violation of our constitution, by making our government a government of men, and not of laws in criminal cases; yet the quarter from which it originated ought to raise a virtuous jealousy in the minds of the people. It is a dan∣gerous symptom when we see men, already high in power, grasping still at more, and ever devising ways and means to encrease their official influ∣ence.</P>
<P>TO point out all the evils, and political sole∣cisms of the bill under consideration, would require more time, and more law knowledge, than I can
<PB N="110" REF="024407_0503_0FC6FD2F14EFE8B8"/>
command; but I am confident that such an establish∣ment will be injurious to the security and justice intended by the common law, and subversive of the spirit of our free constitution.</P>
<P>I hope our legislature will not hastily part with so high a prerogative of sovereign power, or subject the citizens of this state, who may hereafter of∣fend, to be punished at the discretion of the judges.</P>
<P>I conclude with an extract to the purpose from 4 Black. ch. 29. pa. 377.</P>
<P><Q>It is, moreover, one of the glories of our English law, that the nature, though not always the quantity or degrees <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This respects pecuniary fines, which, as the author afterwards explains, cannot be fixed precisely by law, but must vary according to the nature of the offence, the abilities of the offender, and other circumstances.</NOTE>, of punishment, is as∣certained for every offence; and that it is not left in the breast of any judge, or even of a jury, to alter the judgement which the law has beforehand ordained for every subject alike, without respect of persons. For if judgments were to be the private opinions of the judge, men would then be slaves to their magistrates,
<PB N="111" REF="024407_0504_0FC6FD368D62A2C0"/>
and would live in society without exactly knowing the conditions and obligations which it lays them under. And besides, as this pre∣vents oppression on the one hand; so, on the other it stifles all hopes of impunity or mitigation with which an offender might flatter himself, if, his punishment depended on the humour or discretion of the court. Whereas, where an established penalty is annexed to crimes, the criminal may read their certain consequence in that law which ought to be the unvaried rule, as it is the inflexible judge, of his actions.</Q></P>

<HEAD>A SUIT IN THE HIGH COURT OF HONOUR. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>THIS piece of humour was founded on the idea of establishing a high court of honour (See vol. I. page, 151), and accidentally occasioned the following singular ANECDOTE.</P>
<P>THE piece had been inclosed in a cover, addressed to <HI>James Wil∣son</HI> Esq. for whom it was designed, and sent to his house. Mr Wil∣son not being at home, his servant received the packet, and stuck it behind the parlour looking glass. Cap. ††††† who was frequently deranged in his mind, and at such times full of notions of plots and conspiracies, went into Mr Wilson's parlour wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hout knocking when none of the family happened to be there; and seeing the packet in the frame of the looking glass took it down and went off with it.</P>
<P>THERE was at this time a cause agitated in the supreme court of great popular attention, in which <HI>Mr Wilson,</HI> and most of the gen∣tlemen of the bar, were engaged.</P>
<P>THE next day I went to court, and happening to be seated near Mr. Wilson, I asked him if he had received my packet; he told me he did not get home till late in the evening; that the servant in∣formed him there had been a letter for him, and that he had put it behind the glass; but that it had all at once disappeared, and no body could give any account of it, although enquiry had been made through the whole family.</P>
<P>WHILST we were thus talking, a cry of, make way there! was heard in the court, when capt. †††††, having pushed his way through the crowd, appeared before the bar with papers in his hand. He interrupted the lawyer who was then speaking, and in∣formed the judges that he had papers in his hand which would immedi∣ately clear up and determine the cause before the court; and that he had also discovered a most horrible and dangerous plot, partly a∣gainst the state, and partly against the judge of admiralty: confes∣sing that he had made this great discovery by breaking into and robbing that gentleman's house, pointing to Mr. Wilson; declaring that so far as he was amenable for the robbery, he stood ready to submit to the laws.</P>
<P>THE papers, which I immediately knew to be mine, were handed up to the bench, and the chief justice was preparing to read the contents aloud to the court; but I forced my way to him, and and whispered him, that it was only a piece of literary sport be- Mr. Wilson and me, and very unfit for the public ear on such an occasion. The papers were then delivered to Mr. Wilson, and the audience assured that they did not concern the present cause.</P></NOTE></HEAD>

<HEAD>A LETTER TO THE REV. DOCTOR WHITE, RECTOR OF CHRIST CHURCH AND ST. PETER'S ON THE CONDUCT OF A CHURCH ORGAN.</HEAD>
<P>I AM one of those who take great delight in sacred music, and think, with royal David, that heart, voice, and instrument should unite in ado∣ration of the great Supreme.</P>
<P>A soul truly touched with love and gratitude, or under the influence of penitential sorrow, will unavoidably break forth in expressions suited to its feelings. In order that these emanations of the mind may be conducted with uniformity and a be∣coming propriety, our church hath adopted into
<PB N="120" REF="024407_0513_0FC6FD5B6294C498"/>
her liturgy, the book of psalms, commonly called <HI>David's Psalms,</HI> which contain a great variety of addresses to the Deity, adapted to almost every state and temperature of a devout heart, and ex∣pressed in terms always proper, and often sublime.</P>
<P>TO give wings, as it were to this holy zeal, and heighten the harmony of the soul, <HI>organs</HI> have been introduced into the churches. The appli∣cation of instrumental music to the purposes of piety is well known to be of very ancient date. Indeed, originally, it was thought that music ought not to be applied to any other purpose. Modern improvements, however, have discovered, that it may be made expressive of every passion of the mind, and become an incitement to levity as well as sanctity.</P>
<P>UNLESS the real design for which an organ is placed in a church be constantly kept in view, no∣thing is more likely to happen than an abuse of this noble instrument, so as to render it rather an ob∣struction to, than an assistant in, the good pur∣pose for which the hearers have assembled.</P>
<P>GIVE me leave, sir, to suggest a few rules for the conduct of an organ in a place of worship, according to my ideas of propriety.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="121" REF="024407_0514_0FC6FD609A495AD8"/>1<SUP>st</SUP>. The organist should always keep in mind, that neither the time or place is suitable for exhi∣biting all his powers of execution; and that the congregation have not assembled to be entertained with his performance. The excellence of an or∣ganist consists in his making the instrument sub∣servient and conducive to the purposes of devo∣tion. None but a master can do this. An ordi∣nary performer may play surprising tricks, and shew great dexterity in running through difficult passages, which he hath subdued by dint of pre∣vious labour and practice. But <HI>he</HI> must have judgement and taste who can call forth the pow∣ers of the instrument, and apply them with propri∣ety and effect to the seriousness of the occasion.</P>
<P N="2">2<SUP>nd</SUP>. The voluntary, previous to reading the lessons, was probably designed to fill up a solemn pause in the service; during which, the clergyman takes a few minutes respite, in a duty too lengthy, perhaps, to be continued without fatigue, unless some intermission be allowed: there, the organ hath its part alone, and the organist an opportu∣nity of shewing his power over the instrument. This, however, should be done with great discretion and dignity, avoiding every thing light and trivial; but rather endeavouring to compose the minds of the audience, and strengthen the tendency of the
<PB N="122" REF="024407_0515_0FC6FD640408A760"/>
heart in those devout exercises, in which, it should be presumed, the congregation are now engaged. All sudden jirks, strong contrasts of <HI>piano</HI> and <HI>forte,</HI> rapid execution, and expressions of tumult, should be avoided. The voluntary should proceed with great chastity and decorum; the organist keeping in mind, that his hearers are now in the midst of divine service. The full organ should seldom be used on this occasion, nor should the voluntary last more than <HI>five minutes</HI> of time. Some relax∣ation, however, of this rule may be allowed, on festivals and grand occasions.</P>
<P N="3">3<SUP>d</SUP>. The <HI>chants</HI> form a pleasing and animating part of the service; but it should be considered, that they are not songs or tunes, but a species of <HI>recitative,</HI> which is no more than speaking musically. There∣fore, as melody or song is out of the question, it is necessary that the harmony should be complete, otherwise <HI>chanting,</HI> with all the voices in unison, is too light and thin for the solemnity of the occa∣sion. There should at least be half a dozen voices in the organ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>llery to fill the harmony with bass and treble parts, and give a dignity to the per∣formance. Melody may be frivolous; harmony, never.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="123" REF="024407_0516_0FC6FD6843CD9E18"/>4<SUP>th</SUP>. The prelude which the organ plays imme∣diately after the psalm is given out, was intended to advertise the congregation of the psalm tune which is going to be sung; but some famous or∣ganist, in order to shew how much he could make of a little, has introduced the custom of running so many divisions upon the simple melody of a psalm tune, that the original purpose of this pre∣lude is now totally defeated, and the tune so dis∣guised by the fantastical flourishes of the dexterous performer, that not an individual in the congrega∣tion can possibly guess the tune intended, until the clerk has sung through the first line of the psalm. And it is constantly observable, that the full congregation never join in the psalm before the second or third line, for want of that infor∣mation which the organ should have given. The tune should be distinctly given out by the instru∣ment, with only a few chaste and expressive deco∣rations, such as none but a master can give.</P>
<P N="5">5<SUP>th</SUP>. The interludes between the verses of the psalm were designed to give the singers a little pause, not only to take breath, but also an oppor∣tunity for a short retrospect of the words they have sung, in which the organ ought to assist their reflections. For this purpose the organist should be previously informed by the clerk of the verses
<PB N="124" REF="024407_0517_0FC6FD69AFE1ACD8"/>
to be sung, that he may modulate his interludes ac∣cording to the subject.</P>
<P>TO place this in a strong point of view, no stronger, however, than what I have too fre∣quently observed to happen; suppose the congre∣gation to have sung the first verse of the 33<SUP>d</SUP> psalm.</P>
<L>"Let all the just to God with joy</L>
<L>Their chearful voices raise;</L>
<L>For well the righteous it becomes</L>
<L>To sing glad songs of praise."</L>
<P>How dissonant would it be for the organist to play a pathetic interlude in a flat third, with the slender and distant tones of the echo organ, or the deep and smothered sounds of a single diapason stop?</P>
<P>Or suppose again, that the words sung have been the 6<SUP>th</SUP> verse of the vi<SUP>th</SUP> psalm.</P>
<L>"Quite tired with pain, with groaning faint,</L>
<L>No hope of ease I see,</L>
<L>The night, that quiets common griefs</L>
<L>Is spent in tears by me"—</L>
<P><PB N="125" REF="024407_0518_0FC6FD6B29FEF230"/>
How monstrously absurd would it be to hear these words of distress succeeded by an interlude selected from the fag end of some thundering figure on a full organ, and spun out to a most unreasonable length? Or, what is still worse, by some trivial melody with a rhythm so strongly marked, as to set all the congregation to beating time with their feet or heads? Even those who may be impressed with the feelings such words should occasion, or in the least disposed for melancholy, must be shocked at so gross in impropriety.</P>
<P>THE interludes should not be continued above 16 bars in <HI>triple,</HI> or ten or twelve bars in <HI>common</HI> time, and should always be adapted to the verse sung: and herein the organist hath a fine oppor∣tunity of shewing his sensibility, and displaying his taste and skill.</P>
<P N="6">6<SUP>th</SUP>. The voluntary after service was never in∣tended to eradicate every serious idea which the sermon may have inculcated. It should rather be expressive of that chearful satisfaction which a good heart feels under the sense of a duty perfor∣med. It should bear, if possible, some analogy with the discourse delivered from the pulpit; at least, it should not be totally dissonant from it. If the preacher has had for his subject, penitence
<PB N="126" REF="024407_0519_0FC6FD789CE1A958"/>
for sin, the frailty and uncertainty of human life, or the evils incident to mortality, the voluntary may be somewhat more chearful than the tenor of such a sermon might in strictness suggest; but by no means so full and free as a discourse on praise, thanksgiving, and joy, would authorize.</P>
<P>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> general, the organ should ever preserve its dignity, and upon no account issue light and poin∣ted movements which may draw the attention of the congregation and induce them to carry home, not the serious sentiments which the service should impress, but some very petty air with which the organist hath been so good as to entertain them. It is as offensive to hear lilts and jiggs from a church organ, as it would be to see a venerable matron frisking through the public street with all the fantastic airs of a <HI>columbine.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SURVEYING.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE been long urged by an invincible pro∣perty to attempt some thing for the public good, or public convenience, so as to render my name famous amongst the benefactors of mankind. As my desire is much stronger than my abilities, I am obliged to be content with humble attempts at discoveries of limited importance; for I confess that my genius is not of the highest rank.</P>
<P>THE project which has lately employed my thoughts, and which I am now about to commu∣nicate, will not be valued as conducive to the happiness of mankind in a serious sense; yet I hope the novelty of the design, and its affording a con∣siderable gratification at a very small expence, will entitle me to some reputation with the public: espe∣cially when it shall be considered, that I do not, like other projectors and discoverers, make an emolu∣ment of my ingenuity, but freely give the fruits of my speculations to my beloved fellow citizens,
<PB N="128" REF="024407_0521_0FC6FD7AF031D848"/>
in the first place, and through to them, to the world at large.</P>
<P>I have frequently thought that the arts and sciences might be extended beyond the limits of their professed objects, and applied with advantage to other purposes than those for which they seem directly intended. I remember that when I was a boy, my father saw me boring a hole with the leg of my compasses, for which he reproved me, and advised me never to use a thing in a way which it was not designed—But <HI>Dr. Franklin,</HI> who was present▪ declared himself of a different opinion; and said he had often admired the dexterity of a ser∣vant who would occasionally sweep the hearth with the bellows, and blow the sire with the hearth-brush.</P>
<P>I once saw an elaborate work of an ingenious Frenchman, by which any person was enabled to compose an infinite number of minuets without the least knowledge of music, or any other instru∣ment, but a box and dice.</P>
<P>THIS readiness in applying things to purposes for which they seem not designed has often been of the greatest importance in cases of extre∣mity. The adventures of <HI>Robinson Crusoe,</HI> and
<PB N="129" REF="024407_0522_0FC6FD7C69618180"/>
the histories of perilous voyages and ship-wrecks, afford innumerable instances of the great advantage of such a talent.</P>
<P>I am by profession a <HI>surveyer</HI>; not indeed of the first rate reputation, yet I can execute my business with tolerable accuracy, and have given satisfaction to my employers. I, not long since, surveyed a tract of land, the boundaries of which were so singular, that when I came to plot the lines and courses from my table book, I was surprised to find that the survey exhibited the lines of a hu∣man face. This suggested to me the idea of apply∣ing the art of <HI>surveying</HI> to the purpose of <HI>portrait painting</HI>—Only consider, candid reader, what an advantage this must be to the world—Who is there that does not wish to see a true and faith∣ful likeness of those eminent personages he reads of in history? Their actions indeed are recor∣ded; but these may appear in very different lights to different people, and admit of very vari∣ous comments, for want of knowing the secret mo∣tives which influenced those actions. Now there is no better way known, of ascertaining a man's intrinsic character, than by the indication of his countenance: hence the science of physiognomy, and the great encouragement <HI>portrait painting</HI>
hath found. But painting on canvass is very ex∣pensive,
<PB N="130" REF="024407_0523_0FC6FD895FC8CB88"/>
and original likenesses very scarce. As to <HI>engravings,</HI> they are by no means to be depen∣ded upon; every copyist varies more and more from the original: so that by the time a man has been dead forty or fifty years, however emi∣nent he may have been, the prints bearing his name, are no more like him, than the sign of the king of Prussia in third street is like that monarch. The thing should be brought to a <HI>mathematical</HI>
certainty. And this, I flatter myself, I have been so lucky as to accomplish.</P>
<P>THE operation is quite easy, both to the party and to the artist. There is nothing more neces∣sary that to take a correct outline of the person's profile, by throwing the shadow of his face <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Or of his whole person.</NOTE> upon a sheet of paper—a familiar and well known prac∣tice, then let the artist take his scale and dividers, and carefully measure all the courses and distances of the lines which form the boundaries of the shadow. By the same means of courses and di∣stances, the situation, form, and size of the eye, eye brow, mouth, &amp;c. &amp;c. may be precisely as∣certained; and thus by the help of a few letters and figures, may the exact likenesses of great per∣sonages be transmitted to posterity, and made as
<PB N="131" REF="024407_0524_0FC6FD8B68AB4528"/>
public as a common advertisement, and at as little expence.</P>
<P>WHAT satisfaction would it not afford us at this day to be possessed of an accurate survey of the faces of <HI>Julius Caesar, Mark Anthony, Cicero, Virgil, Horace,</HI> and other renowned characters, who are now only known by their works and exploits.</P>
<P>MY project will, moreover, be particularly bene∣ficial to private families; a man may, in the division of his estate, so contrive it as to leave his likeness in a tract of land. So that his grandson will have nothing to do but consult his title deeds, take down the lines and courses of his farm, and by plotting them on paper may at any time pro∣duce the portrait of his deceased ancestor, and survey his ground and his grandfather at one and the same time; whose resemblance will be thus se∣cured to his family, subject to no variation, but the variation of the needle.</P>
<P>MY scheme will be sufficiently manifested by an example. And this I shall give by transcribing from my table book the courses and distances of the tract of land which gave me the first idea of applying the practice of surveying to the purposes of portrait painting.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="024407_0525_0FC6FD8CED6B4608"/>THE following is an exact copy of the courses and distances, and the drawing is plotted from them with as much accuracy as the subject would admit.</P>
<P>FROM an assumed point A, run a line S. 67° 30′ W. 52 perches, to a point B; thence N. 5° W. 64 perches to C; thence N. 7° W. 36 perches to D; thence due west, 60 perches to E; thence N. 48° E. 110 perches to F; thence N. 13° E. 60 perches to G; thence N. 45° E. 190 perches to H; thence N. 77° E. 108 perches to I; thence S. 5° W. 240 perches to K; thence along the same course 120 perches to L; thence S. 78° W. 180 perches to M; and thence 30 perches to the place of beginning.</P>
<P>THESE lines form external boundaries of the tract. For a further description, the following courses and distances must be observed.</P>
<P>FROM the point A continue the line B A, 100 perches to N; thence N. 29°. E. 48 perches to a point. From the point C a soul ditch runs eastward 35 perches. From the point D it is 25 perches to the edge of a circular hill bending westward, and over D is an eliptical hollow 40 perches long, where it joins the southermost part
<PB N="133" REF="024407_0526_0FC6FD8EA7E8EF28"/>
of the circular hill. The soil of this eliptical hol∣low is very moist and unctuous: and fit for the cul∣tivation of Tobacco—From the point F a piece of woodland runs N. 48° E. 59 perches to a point, and thence tends south-easterly 45 perches. This copse of woods is of an eliptical form, beginning very narrow at F and encreasing to 10 perches in width at the northernmost point of the curve, and thence decreases in width to the south-eas∣ternmost point, where it is very thin.</P>
<P>IN a due north and south line passing through the point M, and at the distance of 180 perches north of M, assume a point 0, and from that point draw a line N. 70° W. 30 perches. From a point in this line, a little to the westward of 0, draw another line running southwestwardly 25 per∣ches, forming an angle of 35° with the other line. About 20 perches from the angular point 0 draw a circular line perpendicularly and <HI>looking</HI>
westward. These three lines will form a mixed triangle, whereof two of the legs will be right lines, and the third a portion of a sphere. The northern leg of this triangle is fringed with rushes, being the edge of a watery soil, it must therefore be penciled somewhat thicker and stronger than the southern leg, which should be rather faintly sketched than absolutely drawn.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="024407_0527_0FC6FD98D8E89A28"/>FROM the point G run a line N. 60° E. 150 perches to a point P; thence South 46° E. 20 perches to Q; thence south 30° W. 130 perches to R; thence due south 20 perches to S; thence S. 62° E. 95 perches to T; and thence 70 perches to K.</P>
<P>FROM the middle of the line S T, there is a circular piece of rising ground, being 45 perches on the line S T, and stretching south-westerly 25 perches. At the foot of this rising ground is a copse, thick covered with wild brush and coarse underwood, of a circular shape, whose diameter from N. E. to S. W. is 45 perches, and from N. W. to S. E. 40 perches.</P>
<P>ALL the space bounded by the lines G, H, I, K, T, S, R, Q, P, is a cold, moist, and barren soil, producing nothing but a profusion of coarse reeds, rank and long. These have been so blown down by westerly winds, that from G they tend to the E. N. E; from P Q to the N. E. and from R S eastwardly. These reeds run over the boundary line I K very straggling and irre∣gular, so as to cover and conceal that line: and therefore the line I K must not be drawn abso∣lute, but only dotted, or traced, being no more than the average course of the long reeds. From
<PB N="135" REF="024407_0528_0FC6FD9A2D30EC88"/>
the whole line T K, the reeds run due south, and are very thick and long. All this must be ex∣pressed by the pencil. Lastly, all the sharp angles of the figure must be moderately rounded off, and all the lines made somewhat arching, but sparing∣ly. The eye of the artist will best direct him how to dress the lines and angles so as to answer the general design.</P>
<P>IF the above courses and distances are carefully laid down upon paper, and the directions observ∣ed, they will produce the drawing of a human face: and if the draftsman should have any to∣lerable judgment in things of this kind, and a warm imagination, he may fancy that he discovers a likeness of some person or other. I plotted my scale of ½ inch to 100 perches.</P>
<P>I have it in contemplation to improve my device, by ascertaining, in fixed terms, the manner in which a profile so drawn may be coloured to the life, and thereby make the likeness perfect. For this purpose I had recourse to <HI>heraldry;</HI> and hoped by means of <HI>or, argent, gules,</HI> &amp;c. to dictate precisely the complexion, colour of the hair, eyes, &amp;c. but could not find terms sufficient to express the neces∣sary teints: and as to the termination <HI>ish,</HI> which some make use of, as in blueish, greenish, redish,
<PB N="136" REF="024407_0529_0FC6FD9B27905390"/>
&amp;c. it is too vague and indeterminate for the pur∣pose. Unless, therefore, I can find some known art or science which will furnish definitions of co∣lours as certain and intelligible, as surveying gives us lines and courses, I shall be obliged to com∣pose a set of appellations answerable to all the principal colours, and as many of their gradations and mixtures as are usual in portrait painting. These being once admitted, will serve for ever after. Thus, in engraving, the directions of the strokes of the engraver ascertain the colours or <HI>blazoning</HI> of a coat of arms. When it became generally admitted that horizontal strokes should indicate <HI>blue,</HI> perpendicular strokes, <HI>red;</HI> dia∣gonal strokes, <HI>green;</HI> and so on, all uncertain∣tainty was removed.</P>
<P>PERHAPS Mr. Pine and Mr. Peale may take it into their heads, that I have made this discovery public, with a malicious intention to injure them in their profession; but I protest before all men, that I have a considerable esteem for those ingenious gentlemen, and would willingly have suppressed my project out of tenderness to them, had not an urgent sense of the duty I owe to my fellow-citi∣zens at large, overbalanced the influence of pri∣vate attachments.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="024407_0530_0FC6FD9CA0E17EE8"/>IT will be in vain for any projector, in France, England, or elsewhere, to dispute with me the ho∣nour of this invention, unless he can produce a publication of a similar scheme, bearing date prior to this month of November 1784. But, to pre∣vent all mistakes, I wish our philosophical society would be so good as to make a minute of my disco∣very: and it would be still better, if <HI>Mr. Patter∣son</HI>
would give the foregoing survey, as a task to the lads of the university under his tuition.</P>

<P>A Man who is <HI>disposed</HI> to be entertained may find amusement in the most common occurrences of life. Objects strike the eye, and incidents af∣fect the mind, very differently in different persons. Some men accustom themselves to see every thing in a ludicrous point of view; others, in a serious light; and, the multitude are content with m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re per∣ception; that is, barely seeing and hearing, with∣out making any other further use of their senses.</P>
<P>THIS diversity of disposition is founded in the original constitutions of the parties. The <HI>humorist</HI> was funny and roguish when a boy; following the propensity of his nature, he acquires an habitual facility in associating ludicrous ideas with the most ordinary, and seemingly the most barren incidents
<PB N="139" REF="024407_0532_0FC6FDA7F30C2938"/>
of life. His eye immmediately discovers any sin∣gularity of countenance, or manner, because he is always loooking for singularities; and he finds something to divert him in the most common transactions, because he is always hunting for diversion.</P>
<P>I have myself, some tincture of this disposition; and, when disengaged from more serious business, I sally forth with a design to seek for entertainment. A variety of sources immediately present. For in∣stance: it requires no great effort of imagination to suppose that the major part of the inhabitants of this great city are actually <HI>mad.</HI> Impressed with this idea, I observe the countenance, gait, and manner of every one I meet, and endeavour to class my lunatics under different species of frenzy.</P>
<P>ONE fellow drives along with such heedless impetuosity, that he treads in the gutters instead of stepping over them, and runs against the posts, which he might easily avoid. Another, has such strong marks of anxiety, expressed in every feature of his face, that his whole soul seems to be ab∣sorbed in some sale, purchase, or other pursuit. A third, is haranguing with great vehemence to two or three ignoramuses who devour his politics with open ears. And, I see a fourth, in a violent
<PB N="140" REF="024407_0533_0FC6FDA9A3968CC8"/>
passion, cursing and swearing like a sailor in a storm. But there is no end to the variety of cha∣racters that present, and consequently no end to this source of observation and entertainment.</P>
<P>AT another time, I apply to the streets for a different species of diversion. I walk round a square, and attend to all the scraps and fragments of conversation I can pick up <HI>en passant.</HI> When I return home I write these on separate pieces of paper: and then amuse myself with arranging them in such order as to produce, if possible some apparent connection. If this cannot be done, I make another excursion, and collect more materials, till out of a great number, I am enabled to accom∣plish my purpose. For example—</P>

<P>A very familiar dialogue commences, in which each performer endeavours to display the charac∣ter of his antagonist in as striking a manner as pos∣sible to my great satisfaction. I imagine I see the pro∣fessional battle. The divine throws text of scripture in the face of his adversary, and hampers him with the cords of logical conclusions; whilst the physician squirts clysters at the divine, and claps cantharides on his back.</P>
<P>BUT the most comical part of the scene is this. The learned divine <HI>hoists</HI> the university, and expos∣ing its naked skin, exclaims with admiration—"Oh, charming! behold and see what a <HI>broad bottom</HI> is
<PB N="143" REF="024407_0536_0FC6FDB567ACA978"/>
here!" Whereupon the physician immediately <HI>hoists Dickenson college,</HI> and with equal eloquence descants upon its <HI>narrow bottom.</HI>—"Look, says the divine, on this capacious disk—on the one side sits the <HI>pope</HI>; on the other side sits <HI>Luther;</HI> and see how snug <HI>Calvin</HI> lies between them both." "Its all wrong, replies the physician, <HI>Calvin</HI> has no busi∣ness there: he will be choaked—he will be suffoca∣ted—he will be squeezed to death—here is a fine <HI>narrow bottom</HI> more fit for his accommodation. He can have it all to himself—he is a <HI>usurper</HI> there, but <HI>this</HI> is his own flesh and blood." From words they proceed to blows. The divine is heated with zeal seven times hotter than Nebuchadnezzar's fur∣nace: he vociferates—"The sword of the Lord and of Gideon!" and forthwith flogs away on the narrow bottom of poor <HI>Carlisle.</HI> The physician is also enraged. "By the bones of Boerhaave, and the dust of Hypocrates, says he, I will be even with you:" and without further prelude, falls to scourging the pope, Luther, and Calvin all at once upon the broad bottom of the university.—But the scence changes—</P>

<HEAD>A LETTER FROM A GENTLEMAN IN AMERICA, TO HIS FRIEND IN EUROPE, ON WHITE-WASHING.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE peculiar customs of every country appear to strangers awkward and absurd, but the inhabi∣tants consider them as very proper and even ne∣cessary. Long habit imposes on the understanding, and reconciles it to any thing that is not manifestly pernicious or immediately destructive.</P>
<P>THE religion of a country is scarcely held in greater veneration than its established customs: and it is almost as difficult to produce an alteration in the one as in the other. Any interference of
<PB N="147" REF="024407_0540_0FC6FDC222A54728"/>
government for the reformation of natural customs, however trivial and absurd they may be, never fails to produce the greatest discontent, and sometimes dangerous convulsions. Of this there are frequent instances in history. Bad habits are most safely removed by the same means that established them, viz. by imperceptible gradations, and the constant example and influence of the higher class of the people.</P>
<P>WE are apt to conclude that the fashions and manners of our own country are most rational and proper, because the eye and the understanding have long since been reconciled to them, and we ridicule or condemn those of other nations on account of their novelty: yet the foreigner will defend his national habits with at least as much plausibility as we can our own. The truth is, that reason has little to do in the matter. Customs are for the most part arbitrary, and one nation has as good a right to fix its peculiarities as another. It is of no pur∣pose to talk of convenience as a standard: every thing becomes convenient by practice and habit.</P>
<P>I have read somewhere of a nation (in Africa I think) which is governed by twelve counsellors. When these counsellors are to meet on public bu∣siness, twelve large earthen jars are set in two rows,
<PB N="148" REF="024407_0541_0FC6FDC4F9E69220"/>
and filled with water. The counsellors enter the apartment one after another, stark naked, and each leaps into a jar, where he sits up to the chin in water. When the jars are all filled with counsel∣lors, they proceed to deliberate on the great con∣cerns of the nation. This, to be sure, forms a very grotesque scene; but the object is to transact the public business: they have been accustomed to do it in this way, and therefore it appears to them the most rational and convenient way. Indeed, if we consider it impartially, there seems to be no reason why a counsellor may not be as wise in an earthen jar as in an elbow chair; or why the good of the people may not be as maturely considered in the one as in the other.</P>
<P>THE established manners of every country are the standards of propriety with the people who have adopted them; and every nation assumes the right of considering all deviations therefrom as barbarisms and absurdities.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Chinese</HI> have retained their laws and cus∣toms for ages immemorial: and although they have long had a commercial intercourse with Eu∣ropean nations, and are well acquainted with their improvements in the arts, and their modes of civi∣lization, yet they are so far from being convinced
<PB N="149" REF="024407_0542_0FC6FDCEED48CDD0"/>
of any superiority in the European manners, that their government takes the most serious measures to prevent the customs of foreigners taking root amongst them. It employs their utmost vigilance to enjoy the benefits of commerce, and at the same time guard against innovations that might affect the the characterestic manners of the people.</P>
<P>SINCE the discovery of the <HI>Sandwich</HI> islands in the South-Sea, they have been visited by ships from several nations; yet the natives have shewn no inclination to prefer the dress and manners of the visitors to their own. It is even probable that they pity the ignorance of the Europeans they have seen, as far removed from civilization; and value themselves on the propriety and advantage of their own customs.</P>
<P>THERE is nothing new in these observations, and I had no intention of making them when I sat down to write, but they obtruded themselves upon me. My intention was to give you some account of the people of these new states; but I am not sufficiently informed for the purpose, having, as yet, seen little more than the cities of <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>Philadelphia.</HI> I have discovered but few na∣tional singularities amongst them. Their customs and manners are nearly the same with those of
<PB N="150" REF="024407_0543_0FC6FDD06212D6E0"/>
England, which they have long been used to copy. For, previous to the late revolution, the Americans were taught from their infancy to look up to the English as the patterns of perfection in all things.</P>
<P>I have, however, observed one custom, which, for ought I know, is peculiar to this country. An account of it will serve to fill up the remainder of this sheet, and may afford you some amusement.</P>
<P>WHEN a young couple are about to enter on the matrimonial state, a never failing article in the the marriage treaty is, that the lady shall have and enjoy the free and unmolested exercise of the rights of WHITE-WASHING, with all its ceremonials, pri∣vileges, and appurtenances. You will wonder what this privilege of <HI>white-washing</HI> is. I will endea∣vour to give you an idea of the ceremony, as I have seen it performed.</P>
<P>THERE is no season of the year in which the la∣dy may not, if she pleases, claim her privilege; but the latter end of May is generally fixed upon for the purpose. The attentive husband may judge, by certain prognostics, when the storm is nigh at hand. If the lady grows uncommonly fretful, finds fault with the servants, is discontented with the
<PB N="151" REF="024407_0544_0FC6FDD8029A1F58"/>
children, and complains much of the nastiness of every thing about her: these are symptoms which ought not to be neglected, yet they sometimes go off without any further effect. But if, when the husband rises in the morning, he should observe in the yard, a wheelbarrow, with a quantity of lime in it, or should see certain buckets filled with a so∣lution of lime in water, there is no time for hesita∣tion. He immediately locks up the apartment or closet where his papers, and private property are kept, and putting the key in his pocket, betakes himself to flight. A husband, however beloved, becomes a perfect nuisance during this season of female rage. His authority is superseded, his commission suspended, and the very scullion who cleans the brasses in the kitchen becomes of more importance than him. He has nothing for it but to abdicate, for a time, and run from an evil which he can neither prevent nor molify.</P>
<P>THE husband gone, the ceremony begins. The walls are stripped of their furniture—paintings, prints, and looking-glasses lie in huddled heaps about the floors; the curtains are torn from their testers, the beds crammed into windows, chairs and tables, bedsteads and cradles crowd the yard; and the garden fence bends beneath the weight of carpets, blankets, cloth cloaks, old coats, under
<PB N="152" REF="024407_0545_0FC6FDDA24EC7038"/>
petticoats, and ragged breeches. <HI>Here</HI> may be seen the lumber of the kitchen, forming a dark and confused mass for the fore-ground of the picture; gridirons and frying-pans, rusty shovels and broken tongs, joint stools, and the fractured remains of rush bottomed chairs. <HI>There</HI> a closet has disgorged its bowels—rivetted plates and dishes, halves of china bowls, cracked tumblers, broken wine-glasses, phi∣al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of forgotten physic, papers of unknown pow∣ders, seeds and dryed herbs, tops of tea-pots, and stoppers of departed decanters—from the rag hole in the garret, to the rat hole in the cellar, no place escapes unrummaged. It would seem as if the day of general doom was come, and the uten∣sils of the house were dragged forth to judgment. In this tempest, the words of king <HI>Lear</HI> unavoida∣ble present, and might with little alteration be made strictly applicable.</P>
<L>"—Let the great gods</L>
<L>"That keep this dreadful pudder o'er our heads</L>
<L>"Find out their enemies now. Tremble thou wretch</L>
<L>"That hast within thee undivulged crimes</L>
<L>"Unwhipt of justice—"</L>
<L>"—Close pent up guilt,</L>
<L>"Rive your concealing continents, and ask</L>
<L>"These dreadful summoners grace."</L>
<P>THIS ceremony completed, and the house tho∣roughly
<PB N="153" REF="024407_0546_0FC6FDDBA1565CE0"/>
evacuated, the next operation is to smear the walls and ceilings with brushes, dipped in a so∣lution of lime called WHITE-WASH; to pour buc∣kets of water over every floor, and scratch all the partitions and wainscoats with hard brushes, char∣ged with soft soap and stone-cutter's sand.</P>
<P>THE windows by no means escape the general deluge. A servant scrambles out upon the pent∣house, at the risk, of her neck, and with a mug in her hand, and a bucket within reach, dashes innu∣merable gallons of water against the glass panes, to the great annoyance of passengers in the street.</P>
<P>I have been told that an action at law, was once brought against one of these water nymphs, by a person who had a new suit of clothes spoiled by this operation: but after long argument it was deter∣mined, that no damages could be awarded; inas∣much as the defendant was in the exercise of a le∣gal right, and not answerable for the consequen∣ces. And so the poor gentleman was doubly non-suited; for he lost both his suit of clothes and his suit at law.</P>
<P>THESE smearings and scratchings, these washings and dashings, being duly performed, the next cere∣monial is to cleanse and replace the distracted fur∣niture.

You may have seen a house-raising, or a ship-launch—recollect, if you can, the hurry, bus∣tle, confusion, and noise of such a scene, and you will have some idea of this cleansing match. The misfortune is, that the sole object is to make things <HI>clean.</HI> It matters not how many useful, ornamen∣tal, or valuable articles suffer mutilation or death under the operation. A mahogany chair and a carved frame undergo the same discipline: they are to be made <HI>clean</HI> at all events; but their pre∣servation is not worthy of attention. For instance: a fine large engraving is laid flat upon the floor; a number of smaller prints are piled upon it, until the super-incumbent weight cracks the lower glass —but this is of no importance. A valuable pic∣ture is placed leaning against the sharp corner of a table; others are made to lean against that, till the pressure of the whole forces the corner of the table through the canvas of the first. The frame and glass of a fine print are to be cleaned; the spirit and oil used on this occasion are suffered to leak through and deface the engraving—no matter! If the glass is clean and the frame shines it is sufficient —the rest is not worthy of consideration. An able arithmetician hath made a calculation, founded on long experience, and proved that the losses and de∣struction incident to two white-washings are equal
<PB N="155" REF="024407_0548_0FC6FDE5647A0340"/>
to one removal and three removals equal to one fire.</P>
<P>THIS cleansing frolic over, matters begin to re∣sume their pristine appearance: the storm abates, and all would be well again: but it is impossible that so great a convulsion in so small a community should pass over without producing some conse∣quences. For two or three weeks after the ope∣ration, the family are usually afflicted with sore eyes, sore throats, or severe colds, occasioned by exhalations from wet floors and damp walls.</P>
<P>I know a gentleman here who is fond of ac∣counting for every thing in a philosophical way. He considers this, which I call <HI>a custom,</HI> as a real, periodical disease, peculiar to the climate.— His train of reasoning is whimsical and ingenious, but I am not at leasure to give you the detail. The result was, that he found the distemper to be incurable; but after much study, he thought he had discovered a method to divert the evil he could not subdue. For this purpose, he caused a small building, about twelve feet square, to be erected in his garden, and furnished with some ordinary chairs and tables, and a few prints of the cheapest sort. His hope was, that when the white-washing frenzy seized the females of his fa∣mily
<PB N="156" REF="024407_0549_0FC6FDE6E324DF38"/>
they might repair to this apartment, and scrub, and scour, and smear to their hearts con∣tent; and so spend the violence of the disease in this out-post, whilst he enjoyed himself in quiet at head-quarters. But the experiment did not answer his expectation. It was impossible it should, since a principal part of the gratification consists in the lady's having an uncontrolled right to tor∣ment her husband, at least once in every year▪ to turn him out of doors, and take the reins of government into her own hands.</P>
<P>THERE is a much better contrivance than this of the philosopher's: which is, to cover the walls of the house with paper. This is gene∣rally done. And though it does not abolish, it at least shortens the period of female dominion. This paper is decorated with various fancies, and made so ornamental that the women have admitted the fashion without perceiving the design.</P>
<P>THERE is also another alleviation of the hus∣band's distress. He generally has the sole use of a small room or closet for his books and papers, the key of which he is allowed to keep. This is considered as a privileged place, even in the white-washing season, and stands like the land of <HI>Goshen</HI> amidst the plagues of <HI>Egypt.</HI> But then he
<PB N="157" REF="024407_0550_0FC6FDED07466D40"/>
must be extremely cautious, and ever upon his guard: for should he inadvertently go abroad, and leave the key in his door, the house maid, who is always on the watch for such an oppor∣tunity, immediately enters in triumph with buckets, brooms, and brushes—takes possession of the pre∣mises, and forthwith puts all his books and papers <HI>to rights,</HI> to his utter confusion, and sometimes se∣rious detriment. I can give you an instance.</P>
<P>A gentleman was sued at law, by the executors of a mechanic, on a charge found against him in the deceased's books to the amount of £ 30. The defendant was strongly impressed with a be∣lief that he had discharged the debt and taken a receipt; but as the transaction was of long stan∣ding, he knew not where to find the receipt. The suit went on in course, and the time ap∣proached when judgment should be obtained against him. He then sat down seriously to ex∣amine a large bundle of old papers, which he had untied and displayed on a table for the pur∣pose. In the midst of his search he was sud∣denly called away on business of importance. He forgot to lock the door of his room. The house maid who had been long looking for such a op∣portunity, immediately entered with the usual implements, and with great alacrity fell to clean∣ing
<PB N="158" REF="024407_0551_0FC6FDEF263D98B8"/>
the room and <HI>putting things to rights.</HI> One of the first objects that struck her eye was the confused situation of the papers on the table. These, without delay, she hudled together like so many dirty knives and forks; but in the action a small piece of paper fell unnoticed on the floor, which unfortunately happened to be the very receipt in question. As it had no very respec∣table appearance, it was soon after swept out with the common dirt of the room, and carried in a dust pan to the yard. The tradesman had neg∣lected to enter the credit in his book. The de∣fendant could find nothing to obviate the charge, and so judgment went against him for debt and costs. A fortnight after the whole was set∣tled, and the money paid, one of the children found the receipt amongst the dirt in the yard.</P>
<P>THERE is also another custom, peculiar to the city of Philadelphia, and nearly allied with the former. I mean that of washing the pavements before the doors every Saturday evening. I at first supposed this to be a regulation of the po∣lice; but, on further enquiry, I find it is a religi∣ous rite preparatory to the Sabbath: and it is, I believe, the only religious rite in which the nume∣rous sectaries of this large city perfectly agree. The ceremony begins about sunset and continues
<PB N="159" REF="024407_0552_0FC6FDF0E558B310"/>
till ten or eleven at night. It is very difficult for a stranger to walk the streets on those eve∣nings. He runs a continual risk of having a a bucket of dirty water dashed against his legs; but a Philadelphian born is so much accustomed to the danger that he avoids it with surprising dexterity. It is from this circumstance that a Philadelphian may be known any where by a certain skip in his gait. The streets of New York are paved with rough stones. These, in∣deed, are not washed, but the dirt is so tho∣roughly swept from between them that they stand up sharp and prominent, to the great annoyance of those who are not accustomed to so rough a path. But habit reconciles every thing. It is diverting enough to see a Philadelphian at New York. He walks the street with as much painful caution as if his toes were covered with corns, or his feet lamed by the gout: whilst a New York∣er, as little approving the plain masonry of Phi∣ladelphia, shuffles along the pavement like a parrot upon a mahogany table.</P>
<P>IT must be acknowledged that the ablutions I have mentioned are attended with no small incon∣venience; yet the women would not be induced by consideration to resign their privilege.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="024407_0553_0FC6FDF3A258C538"/>NOTWITHSTANDING this singularity, I can give you the strongest assurances that the women of A∣merica make the most faithful wives, and the most attentive mothers in the world. And I don't doubt but you will join me in opinion, that if a married man is made miserable only for one week in a whole year, he will have no great cause to com∣plain of the matrimonial bond.</P>

<HEAD><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The preceding publication made no small clamour amongst the ladies; to make amends, the author wrote this answer.</NOTE> TO THE EDITOR OF THE COLUMBIAN MAGAZINE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE seen a piece in the <HI>Pennsylvania Pack∣et,</HI> and republished in <HI>Mr. Carey's</HI> Museum, upon the custom of <HI>White-washing,</HI> in which that ne∣cessary duty of a good house-wife is treated with unmerited ridicule. I should probably have for∣got the foolish thing; but the season approaching, which most women think suitable for cleansing their apartments of the smoke and dirt of the winter, I hear this saucy author dished up in eve∣ry family, and his flippant performance quoted whenever a wife attempts to exercise her rea∣sonable prerogative or execute the duties of her station.</P>
<P>WOMEN generally employ their time to better purpose than in scribbling. The care and comforts of a family rest principally on their
<PB N="162" REF="024407_0555_0FC6FDFF920CAAA0"/>
shoulders. Hence it is that there are but few famale authors; and the men, knowing how neces∣sary our attentions are to their happiness, take every opportunity of discouraging literary accom∣plishments in the fair sex. We hear it echo'd from every quarter—
<Q>My wife cannot make verses, it is true; but she makes an excellent pudding—She can't correct the press; but she can correct her children, and scold her servants with admirable discretion—she can't unravel t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> intricacies of political oeconomy and federal go∣vernment; but she can knit charming stock∣ings.</Q>
And this they call praising a wife, and doing justice to her good character.</P>
<P>I say women generally employ their time to bet∣ter purpose than in scribbling; otherwise this face∣tious writer had not escaped so long unanswered. We have ladies who sometimes lay down the needle and take up the pen; I wonder none of them have attempted some reply. For my part I do not pretend to be an author: I never ap∣peared in print in my life, but I can no longer forbear saying something in answer to such imper∣tinence.</P>
<P>ONLY consider, Mr. Editor, our situation. Men are naturally inattentive to the decencies of
<PB N="163" REF="024407_0556_0FC6FE0075556D58"/>
life; but why should I be so complaisant? I say they are naturally nasty beasts. If it were not that their connection with the refined sex polished their manners, and had a happy influence on the general oeconomy of life, these lords of the crea∣tion would wallow in filth, and populous cities would infect the atmosphere with their noxious va∣pours. It is the attention and assiduity of the women that prevent men from degenerating into swine.</P>
<P>HOW important, then, are the services we ren∣der! And yet for these very services we are made the subject of ridicule and fun—Base ingratitude! nauseous creatures! Perhaps you may think I am in a passion—No, Mr. Editor, I do assure you I was never more composed in my life; and yet it is enough to provoke a saint to see how un∣reasonably we are treated by the men—Why, now, there's my husband, a good enough sort of a man in the main, but I will give you a small sam∣ple of him. He comes into the parlour, the other day, where, to be sure, I was cutting up a piece of linen. "Lord, says he, what a clutter here is —I cannot bear to see the parlour look like a tay∣lor's shop—besides, I am going to make some im∣portant philosophical experiments, and must have sufficient room." You must know my husband is
<PB N="164" REF="024407_0557_0FC6FE03973A9050"/>
one of your would-be philosophers. Well—I bundled up my linen as quick as I could, and be∣gan to darn a pair of ruffles, which took up no room, and could give no offence. I was determin∣ed, however, to watch my lord and master's impor∣tant business. In about half an hour the tables were covered with all manner of trumpery—bottles of water, phials of drugs, pasteboard, paper and cards, glue, paste and gum-arabic, files, knives, scissars and needles, rosin, wax, silk, thread, rags, jags, tags, books, pamphlets and manuscripts.— Lord bless me! I am almost out of breath, and yet I have not enumerated half the articles. Well! to work he went, and although I did not under∣stand the object of his manoeuvres, yet I could suf∣ficiently discover that he did not succeed in any one operation: I was glad of that—yes, I confess, I was glad of that, and good reason too. After he had fatigued himself with mischief, like a monkey in a china shop, and had called the servants to clear every thing away, I took a view of the scene be∣fore me. I shall not even attempt a minute de∣scription—suffice it to say, that he had overset his inkstand, and stained my best mahogany table with ink; he had spilt a quantity of vitriol upon my carpet, and burned a hole in it; my marble hearth was all over spotted with melted rosin; he had bro∣ken
<PB N="165" REF="024407_0558_0FC6FE05FA1965D8"/>
three china cups, two wine glasses, a tumbler, and one of my best d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nters; and after <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, as I said before, I perceived that he had not succeeded in any one operation. By the bye—tell your friend the white-wash scribbler, that this is one way by which our closets become furnished with— <Q>halves of china bowls, cracked tumblers, bro∣ken wine glasses, tops of tea pots, and stoppers of departed decanters.</Q>
I say, I took a sober view of the dirt and devastation my philosophical husband had made; and there I sat, <HI>like patience on a monument, smiling at grief;</HI> but it worked in∣wardly—yes, Mr Editor, it worked inwardly, I would almost as lieve the melted rosin had been in his throat, and the vitriol upon his skin, as on my dear marble hearth and my carpet. It is not true that women have no command over their own feelings; for not withstanding this gross provo∣cation I said nothing, or next to nothing; I only observed, very pleasantly, that a lady of my acquaintance had told me, that the reason why philosophers are called <HI>literary</HI> men, is because they frequently make a great <HI>litter</HI>—not a word more—However, the servant cleared away, and down sat the disappointed philosopher. A friend dropt in soon after—"Your servant Sir,—how do you do?" "Oh Lord! I am almost fatigued
<PB N="166" REF="024407_0559_0FC6FE0EC8D0F928"/>
to death—I have been all the morning making philosophical experiments." I was now more hardly put to it to smother a laugh, than I had been just before to contain my resentment. My <HI>precious</HI> went out soon after with his friend—And I, as you may well suppose, immediately mustered all my forces—brushes, buckets, soap, sand, lime-skins, and cocoa-nut shells—all the pow∣ers of house-wifery were employed. I was cer∣tainly the best philosopher of the two, for my experiments succeeded, and his did not—all was well again, except my broken ware and my carpet —my poor vitriolized carpet, which still remains a mournful memento of philosophic fury; or rather of philosophic folly.</P>
<P>THIS operation was scarce over, when in came my <HI>experimental dear,</HI> and told me with all the in∣difference in the world, that he had invited six gentlemen to dine with him at three o'clock—it was then past one—I complained of the short no∣tice—"Poh! Poh! says he, you can get a leg of mutton, and a loin of veal, and a few potatoes, and it will do well enough—Heaven's! what a chaos must the head of a philosopher be!—A leg of mutton, a loin of veal and potatoes! I was at a loss whether I should laugh or be angry.
<PB N="167" REF="024407_0560_0FC6FE108371AB08"/>
But there was no time for determining—I had but an hour and a half to do a world of business in. My carpet, which had suffered in the cause of ex∣perimental philosophy in the morning, was destined to be shamefully dishonoured in the afternoon by a deluge of filthy tobacco juice—Gentlemen smokers and chewers, love segars and pigtail bet∣ter than carpets.</P>
<P>THINK, Mr Editor, what a woman must endure under such circumstances; and then, after all to be reproached with her cleanliness, and to have her white-washings, her scowrings and scrubbings made the subject of public ridicule, is more than patience can put up with.</P>
<P>WHAT I have now exhibited is but a small spe∣cimen of the injuries we suffer under the boasted superiority of the men. But we will not be laughed out of our cleanliness. A woman would rather be called ***** than <HI>slut;</HI> as a man would rather be called a <HI>knave</HI> than <HI>fool.</HI></P>
<P>I had a great deal more to say, but I am called away—We are just preparing to <HI>white-wash</HI>— Yes, I say to <HI>white-wash</HI>—the brushes are ready, the buckets are paraded—my husband is gone

The cellars, however, were fi∣nished, and the building remained a long time without any fur∣ther advancement.

<P>WHETHER it is owing to some solitary hours I pass in my subterraneous shop, or to the overflow∣ings of a large accumulation of ideas, acquired in a life of travel and adventures; or that the in∣cessant motion of my elbows, necessary in my oc∣cupation, which, for reasons unknown, may irritate and provoke the mind to discharge its contents, as the motion of a ship operates upon the sto∣machs, or that by some secret influence of the phi∣losophical walls that surround me I am induced,

or rather compelled to become an author, I know not—But so it is—If any fortune-teller had foretold that in the year 1787 I should make my appearance as an essayist, before the respecta∣able public, I should have laughed at the prophet, and despised his art. And yet I remember I had a dream, some twenty years ago, the interpreta∣tion of which seems now to be plain enough, al∣though at the time I could make nothing of it.</P>
<P>I thought I had lost myself in a thick wood, without any road or path to direct my way. Whilst I was considering what course I should take, a wild goose and a parrot descended from a large tree, and after several circuitous flights, alighted, the one on my right shoulder, and the other on left. These birds were certainly figurative of my authorship and genius.</P>
<P>WHEN a writer makes his first appearance on the public stage, he is like an unknown stranger introducing himself into a large assembly: all eyes are turned towards him, and the whisper goes round
<Q>Who is he? Who is he? Do you know him? Do you? Not I, sir, not I, madam:</Q>
where∣by it becomes necessary that he should give some account of himself. I shall endeavour to satisfy
<PB N="171" REF="024407_0564_0FC6FE1FF624C760"/>
this reasonable expectation in as few <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> I can.</P>
<P>I was born in an obscure village in England. My father could neither read nor write, but had a most profound veneration for men of genius and learning. He carried this blind passion so far, that he was frequently the subject of ridicule; and sometimes suffered real loss by sharpers who imposed themselves upon him for scholars, and authors neglected by the ungrateful world, or men of genius, on the point of producing the most important discoveries.</P>
<P>MY father resolved to do better by me than his father had done by him; and therefore put me to a charity-school as soon as I was eight years old. After two years cruel persecution, I was whipped through the spelling-book as far as words of five syllables. It took me three months and a half to spell the word <HI>liberality;</HI> in which time I received 97 strokes of the ferule on my right hand, and 53 on my left; 8 times I wore the dunce's cap; and 5 times publicly whipt. Besides these, I received one hundred and thirteen stripes with a rattan across my shoulders, and suffered two hundred and twenty five pinches of my right ear. At last I could spell the word <HI>liberality.</HI>
<PB N="172" REF="024407_0565_0FC6FE216E43B448"/>
But being no longer able to bear this cruel disci∣pline, I took to my heels and ran off.</P>
<P>I was running enough to elude the search my father made for me for two years, and subsisted by hiring myself occasionally as a servant. At last, I offered myself to a farmer, who had seen an adver∣tisement answering my description. He secured me, and sent me back to my father, who loaded me with reproaches and abuse. He gave overall expectation of making me a scholar, and fixing his hopes upon my brother <HI>Dick,</HI> bound me ap∣prentice to a shoemaker.</P>
<P>I was almost as unsuccessful here as at the free-school. I acquired a tolerable knack at botching and patching, but could never arrive at the skill of making a whole shoe.</P>
<P>AFTER I had in vain tried for four years to make myself master of the business, I conceived a thorough dislike to the trade, and throwing down my strap and last, I once more threw myself into the hands of fortune.</P>
<P>My father died soon after, and my mother did not think me worth enquiring after.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="024407_0566_0FC6FE2854A0BB30"/>I went through various scenes of employ for se∣ven years: In which time I had great opportu∣nities of making observations on men and manners. I contracted many prejudices; I stored up many opinions, and learned many words: but the word <HI>liberality</HI> was never out of my mind; it had been impressed on my memory, and, I may say, engraved on my flesh.</P>
<P>AT length I engaged in the service of a man very famous in the learned world; a celebrated author in theology and natural philosophy. I lived with him many years. I adopted all his prin∣ciples, not because I understood them, but because I lived with him, and they were his principles, and because I derived no small credit from this connection; as the moon is admired for the light she affords, not that she is luminous in herself, but because she is within the influence of the sun's rays. I was more than the servant, I was the companion of this great man; and as the multi∣tude are apt to think that knowledge may be taken, like the itch or small-pox, by contagion, I acquired a considerable literary reputation amongst illiterate men. I turned the electric wheel for my patron; I kindled his fire; I brought him water; I handed him books from the shelves, and bottles from the closet; and so I became a <HI>philosopher.</HI> Moreover,
<PB N="174" REF="024407_0567_0FC6FE29A2D90158"/>
I carried his manuscripts to the printer, and brought back the printed sheets for correction; and so I became a <HI>theologist.</HI> It is true, I was of∣ten unlucky in my zeal to serve him; I inadvert∣ently discharged his accumulated electricity; I cracked his jars, and broke his bottles; I burned his clothes with vitriol, and his flesh with aqua∣fortis; and frequently stumbled in my way to the printer's, and plunged his manuscript in the ken∣nel. But he was a <HI>philosopher,</HI> and bore all with patience.</P>
<P>STILL the word <HI>liberality</HI> pressed upon my mind. My master and I differed in opinion about dephlogisticated air: I thought he was very <HI>illi∣beral;</HI>
and so we parted, and I determined to tra∣vel far and near in search of true <HI>liberality.</HI></P>
<P>I ran through most of the countries in Europe, in hopes of finding this precious jewel. But, alas! to no purpose. In <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portugal</HI> they be∣lieve in transubstantiation and the pope's infallibi∣lity, and the people of <HI>France</HI> believe in nothing at all; of course there could be no <HI>liberality</HI> in those countries. In <HI>Italy,</HI> they prefer the philo∣sophy of <HI>Ingenhouzen,</HI> to that of my master and friend; this I thought very <HI>illiberal,</HI> notwithstand∣ing our difference. In <HI>Geneva,</HI> they believe in
<PB N="175" REF="024407_0568_0FC6FE2DDE609C80"/>
predestination, a doctrine I abhor: and in <HI>Swit∣zerland,</HI> the citizens make a practice of hiring themselves as soldiers to foreign princes.</P>
<P>I once thought I should find what I was in search of, amongst the rude but uncorrupted inhabitants of the <HI>Alps</HI>: but after sojourning with them many days, I discovered that they esteemed the large <HI>wens</HI> which most of them had hanging to their chins as very ornamental, for my part I thought them extremely ugly, and so I concluded, that there could be no <HI>liberality</HI> on the <HI>Alps.</HI></P>
<P>IT would be a useless task to enumerate all the particulars in which the people of every nation differed from me in opinion, and disappointed me in the object of my pursuit. True genuine <HI>libe∣rality</HI>
was not to be found amongst them.</P>
<P>AT length I returned to England. Here I found things worse than ever. My friend's <HI>the∣ology</HI>
was publicly contested, and some of his doc∣trines even reprobated. Not only this, but the nation was engaged in a war with the people of America, on principles which I could not approve. Convinced, that there was no <HI>liberality</HI> in England▪ I determined to cross the Atlantic, and seek for it in America.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="024407_0569_0FC6FE308D60B2A8"/>ON my arrival in this country, I was much cha∣grined to find that the doctrine of the Trinity was generally received and professed; a doctrine a∣gainst which I had acquired the strongest antipa∣thy from my master, the great philosopher. How∣ever, as war raged in the country, there was no time for theological disquisitions; and as the jus∣tice of the war was clearly on the side of the Americans, I resolved to take an active part in their cause, and enlisted myself a soldier in the Pennsylvania line. I went through inexpressible toil and danger, in marches, counter-marches, skirmishes and battles, and was finally wounded at the siege of <HI>York-Town,</HI> when lord Cornwallis and his army surrendered to the allied forces of France and America.</P>
<P>After the peace, I supported myself by cobling and patching, and employed my leisure hours in combating the doctrine of the Trinity, and devising grand schemes <HI>for public utility.</HI></P>
<P>AT length government thought fit to establish a corps of invalids, and sitted up the east wing of the state-house for their accommodation, and I now belong to this corps. As we have no great deal to do, our duty being very slight, I have spent much time in watching the progress of a
<PB N="177" REF="024407_0570_0FC6FE321B01DD38"/>
building near our quarters, intended as a hall for the Philosophical Society. Although it is not quite a year since the first stone was laid, the cel∣lar is already completed; but <HI>when</HI> the roof will be raised, can be known only to men of profound erudition and nice calculation—to finish my histo∣ry, of which but little now remains—</P>
<P>As I stood looking on, whilst the labourers were digging this philosophical cellar, I took particular notice of the several <HI>stratums</HI> of loam, sand and gra∣as they appeared. I procured samples of each, and submitting them to <HI>hyperstratical</HI> experiments, I found that they were all of different <HI>pacific</HI> gravi∣ties. This extraordinary circumstance strongly prejudiced me in favour of the society and their proposed hall, and I concluded that I should cer∣tainly find <HI>true liberality</HI> in the bottom of this sci∣entific cellar.</P>
<P>As soon as it was completed, and covered with rough boards, I conveyed my bench and cobling tools to this subterraneous temple of Minerva. And here I may be seen daily toiling for <HI>public utility</HI> in the double capacity of cobler and author.</P>
<P>MY situation, so contiguous to the seat of le∣gislation and other offices of state, has made me of
<PB N="178" REF="024407_0571_0FC6FE36E39A2E78"/>
no small use in the commonwealth. And the truth is, that I am now <HI>opprest with public business</HI>—I have heeltaped counsellors; patched the upper leather of judges; examined the <HI>soles</HI> of assembly men, and given some of them better <HI>understandings.</HI></P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING that the care of the state is thus daily pressing upon me, I enjoy good health, owing to the <HI>sallibrity</HI> of my philosophical work-shop: for, it is so ingeniously constructed, that the <HI>atmospheric</HI> air is compelled to descend and displace the <HI>memphitic</HI> air common in cellars and confined places.</P>
<P>FROM this profound habitation I shall date my future essays, and expect that my performances will procure me no small credit with the public, if the people have any <HI>liberality.</HI></P>

<HEADNOTE>
<P>☞A warm dispute had taken place between <HI>Mr. Moore,</HI> a mer∣chant, and <HI>Mr. Lewis,</HI> a lawyer. The parties attacked each other with great acrimony in the public papers; and the contest drew in friends on both sides, who soon became principals in the quarrel. Private challenges began to pass; and what are called the rules of honour were publickly discussed. One gentleman went so far as to publish a general challenge in the newspaper, undertaking to defend Mr. Lewis's side of the question against all persons whatsoever. It seemed very probable that this quarrel would have had a fatal issue amongst some of the parties, when the following piece of ridicule made its appearance, which turned the laugh of the town upon the combatants, entirely crushed the whole affair, and laughed the rules of honour out of countenance. The parties forgave each other sooner than they forgave the author.</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<HEAD>FOR THE PENNSYLVANIA PACKET.</HEAD>
<P>I Mentioned in a former essay that my greatest ambition is to become famous by the invention of some ingenious or useful project which shall be generally approved and adopted. At the same time I communicated to the public, a device, which, from its novelty and convenience, I thought could not fail of success. In vain, however, have I looked for that applause which I still think justly due to the fruit of genius, ripened by the labours
<PB N="180" REF="024407_0573_0FC6FE3D6D509600"/>
of the understanding. The author and his con∣trivance are no more thought of.</P>
<P>I have at different times, published several other devices of rare invention, which have all found the same fate. Whether the fault lies with me, or with the public, I shall not presume to say; but as my love of fame is invincible, I shall go on projecting and contriving in hopes some lucky hit may accomplish my purpose, by procuring me the honour I so ardently desire.</P>
<P>As I am now growing old in the business, ex∣perience and frequent disappointments have taught me to be less sanguine in my expectations; and, like other authors, to depend more on a for∣tuitous possession of the public caprice than on the intrinsic merits of my own performance.</P>
<P>MY present design, which I offer with great modesty, respects an improvement in the art of <HI>printing;</HI> and is a device to ender it not only expressive of an author's narrative, opinions, or ar∣guments; but also of the peculiarities of his tem∣per and the vivacity of his feelings.</P>
<P>As I have as due a regard to literary honesty as to any other kind of honesty, I candidly confess
<PB N="181" REF="024407_0574_0FC6FE3EA6F3F450"/>
that I took the hint from an ingenious work of a <HI>Mr. Steele</HI> of London, who has contrived and published a scheme for noting down, in certain musical characters, the risings, fallings, and various inflections of the voice in common conversation or in public speaking. So that not only the matter of an oration, but even the <HI>manner</HI> of the orator may be secured and transmitted to posterity.</P>
<P>MY contrivance has this advantage over his, that no new characters are necessary to it. Those commonly used in printing are sufficient for the purpose. Besides, his project is only calculated to ascertain the <HI>fortes</HI> and <HI>pianos,</HI> and various <HI>slides</HI> of the human voice in speaking; whereas mine is contrived to designate the <HI>fortes</HI> and <HI>pianos,</HI> and various <HI>slides</HI> of the temper in writing.</P>
<P>MY system is founded in a practice which na∣ture herself dictates, and which every one must have observed, I mean that of elevating the voice in proportion to the agitation of mind, or ear∣nestness of the speaker. Thus a reprimand is given in a higher tone than admonition: and a person in a fright or in passion, exerts his lungs according to the <HI>quantum</HI> of terror or rage with which he is affected.</P>
<P>NOW I would have the degrees of vociferation
<PB N="182" REF="024407_0575_0FC6FE40566D60F8"/>
—such as <HI>pianissimo, piano, forte, fortissimo,</HI> with all the intermediate gradations designated by the size of the letters which compose the emphatic words. And for this the various species of types from <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> Pearl <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> up to Five Line Pica, will afford an ample scale.</P>
<P>THE ingenious authors of advertisements have I confess, in some sort anticipated my design. We often see.</P>
<P><HI>stop thief! stop thief!</HI> bawled out in double Pica Italics. The name of
<PB N="183" REF="024407_0576_0FC6FE4988693A90"/>
a ship to be sold, or some choice article to be dispo∣sed of, in English Roman.</P>
<P>AND as a further enforcement to attention, I have seen the figure of a hand, with a crier's bell in the act of ringing, advertising an auction of household furniture. Every one striving to be heard in preference by a superior magnitude of types. At present there are none who roar out in louder, or blacker characters, than the printers themselves for Rags.</P>
<P>THERE is no looking at the first page of the daily advertiser without imagining a number of people hallowing and bawling to you to buy their goods or lands, to charter their ships, or to in∣form you that a servant or a horse hath strayed a∣way. For my part I am so possessed with this idea, that as soon as I take up the paper of the day, I turn over to articles of Intelligence as quick as possible, lest my eyes should be stunned by the
<PB N="184" REF="024407_0577_0FC6FE4B68A55D70"/>
<HI>occular uproar</HI> of the first page. For I am a peaceable man, and hate nothing more than the confused noise of a mob.</P>
<P>MY project, then, consists in this, that the prin∣ter in composing any work should adapt the size of his types to the spirit of his author, so that a reader may become, in some degree personally acquainted with a writer whilst he is perusing his work. Thus an author of cool and equable spi∣rits might take Bourgeois Roman for his medium, and would probably never rise higher than Great Primer; whilst a passionate man, engaged in a warm con∣troversy, might thunder away in French Canon.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="024407_0578_0FC6FE4CE3D03298"/>IT follows of course that authors of great vi∣gour, should be charged higher than meek writers for printing a work of the same length, on account of the extraordinary space their per∣formances must necessarily occupy; for these gi∣gantic, wrathful types, like ranters on a stage, or Burgoyne at Saratoga, will demand sufficient elbow room.</P>
<P>For example—suppose a newspaper quarrel to happen between M and L<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lest some ill disposed person should maliciously misapply these initials I think proper to declare that M signifies <HI>merchant,</HI> and L Lawyer.</NOTE></P>
<P>M begins the attack pretty smartly in Long primer.</P>
<P>L replies in Pica Roman.</P>
<P>M advances to Great Primer.</P>
<P>L retorts in Double Pica;
<PB N="186" REF="024407_0579_0FC6FE54462B5880"/>
and at last the contest swells up to Rascal, Villain, Coward, in five line pica; which indeed is as far as the art of printing or a modern quarrel can conveni∣ently go.</P>
<P>A philosophical reason might be given to prove that large types will more forcibly affect the optic nerve than those of a smaller size, and therefore become mechanically expressive of ener∣gy and vigour; but I leave this discussion for the amusement of the gentlemen lately elected into our philosophical society. It will satisfy me if my scheme should be adopted and found useful.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="024407_0580_0FC6FE55E1EADC80"/>I recollect a case in point; some few years be∣fore the war, the people of a western county, known at that time by the name of the <HI>Paxton boys,</HI> assembled on account of some discontents, and came down in great numbers, with hostile intentions against the peace of government, and with a particular view to some leading men in the city. <HI>Sir John St Clair,</HI> who had assumed military com∣mand for the defence of the city on this occasion, met one of the obnoxious persons <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Israel P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> in the street, and told him that he had seen the manifesto of the insurgents, and his name particularized by letters "<HI>as long as my fingers.</HI>" The gentleman imme∣diately packed up his most valuable effects and sent them with his family across the Delaware for security. Had Sir John only said, that he had seen his name mentioned in the manifesto, it is probable he would not have been so seriously alarmed; but the unusual size of the letters was to him a plain indication that the insurgents were determined to carry their resentment to a proportionable extremity</P>
<P>I could confirm my scheme by innumerable in∣stances in fact and practice. The title page of every book is an example. It announces the sub∣ject treated of in conspicuous characters; as if the author stood at the door of his edi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ier, calling out
<PB N="188" REF="024407_0581_0FC6FE57966A9A08"/>
to every one to enter and partake of the enter∣tainment he has prepared; and some even scream out their invitation in red letters.</P>
<P>THE journeymen printers have also a custom founded on the same principles. They distinguish every sheet of printing by a letter of the alphabet, which may be seen at the bottom of the first page of every sheet in any book. When they have pro∣ceeded in this alphabetical enumeration as far as the letter O, they are sure to send the editor a proof sheet with an O! as big as a dollar; intimating, that the fatigue and labour they have gone through is so great, as to make them cry aloud for some gratuitous re∣freshment.</P>
<P>IT was reserved for me to improve these hints into a project of general utility. It is indeed high time that such a system should be formed and di∣vulged.
<PB N="189" REF="024407_0582_0FC6FE5EDCF59AD0"/>
For what, alas! are a few <HI>Capitals</HI> and <HI>Italies</HI> in the hands of a vigorous author? and yet these are the only typographical emphatics now in use. In personal altercations, nature has furnished ample means of expression. The muscles of the face; the motion of the eyes; the action of the body; the limbs, and even the hands and fingers —all unite in enforcing the feelings of the soul, and giving additional expression to language—Let art do the best she can in cases where these natu∣ral signs of sentiment cannot be displayed.</P>
<P>IT is truly lamentable, and has given me much concern, to observe with what languor a late reli∣gious dispute, and also a late law controversy, have been conducted; not for want of a proper spirit in the combatants, but merely for want of suf∣ficient vehicle of rage and resentment.</P>
<P>FOR these reasons I hope my proposed im∣provement in the art of printing will be eagerly a∣dopted by gentlemen disputants, and no less so by the gentlemen printers: as the one will find a new and comprehensive field opened for the ex∣hibition of their refined sentiments, exquisite sen∣sibilites, and energy of thought; and the othe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> derive no small emolument from the advanced prices which they may reasonably charge for
<PB N="190" REF="024407_0583_0FC6FE6077601238"/>
printing the controversial essays, and vigo∣rous effussions, of men of spirit and high edu∣cation.</P>
<P>I am, I confess, enamoured of my project, and heartily wish some quarrel, may soon take place and swell even high as high as Five Line Pica, that the whole system of typographical expression may be displayed in one energetic example, and the utility of my project fully manifested—Just as Mr — of the humane societ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ously waited▪ and I believe secretly wished that an accident might happen to evince the efficacy of a grappel he had
<PB N="191" REF="024407_0584_0FC6FE61E77AFEA0"/>
contrived for discovering and drawing up drowned bodies.</P>
<P>LEST, however, such a quarrel should not speedily occur I hereby give public notice (in English Roman N<SUP>o</SUP> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>) that having nothing else to do, and having no wife or child to lament the consequences of my folly, I propose to take up any gentleman's discontent, animosity or affront, and to conduct the same in public contest against his adversary as far as Great Primer, or even French Canon,
<PB N="192" REF="024407_0585_0FC6FE67D9CAE3D8"/>
but not further, without the special leave of the original proprietor of the quarrel, provided; how∣ever, that the dispute began in Bourgeois Roman for if it originated only in Pearl, Nonparei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, or minion, I shall hardly think it worth my notice.</P>
<P>To shew that I am in earnest in this offer, I shall leave my address with the printer of this publication, that any gentleman quarreller may readily find a champion for the cause which he does not choose to championize himself.</P>
<P>I axious<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y wait the issue of this my proposed scheme; not without sanguine hopes that it may prove the lucky hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I have been so long pursuing,

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS OF A FOREIGNER ON THE <HI>JURY TRIALS</HI> OF <HI>ENGLAND.</HI> COMMUNICATED IN A LETTER TO HIS FRIEND.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>London,</HI>
<DATE>Feb. 15, 1784.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR COUNT,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Informed you in my last of the rout I took to arrive at this great city. I described as well as I could, the places I passed through; the manners of the people; the incidents that occurred; and the impositions to which I was obliged to submit. I hope my letters got to hand; not only because they cost me no small trouble to write—by <HI>trouble,</HI> I
<PB N="195" REF="024407_0588_0FC6FE6DEFF29CC8"/>
mean confinement, which you know I hate—but because I think they will afford you some amuse∣ment.</P>
<P>WELL—here I am, and here I have been since the beginning of December last. I have several times attempted to continue my narrative and opi∣nions for your entertainment, according to promise, but could not find myself disposed to sit long enough for the purpose. At present I am necessarily con∣fined by a severe cold; and to this indisposition you are indebted for the letter I am now going to write. You will sincerely wish me better health, when you shall know the dulness of the subject I have undertaken.</P>
<P>YOU will reasonably expect some account of the polite amusements of this metropolis—the manners and taste of the fashionable world—their theatres, concerts, R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>elagh, Pantheon, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. But no; I will give you these some other time. At present I have a very different object in view, which has happened to engage much of my atten∣tion; and, as I always sit down to write what I think, not to think what I shall write, I must take the subject which impresses my mind at the time, or not write at all.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="024407_0589_0FC6F91E0DC3C5F0"/>THE great question—"<HI>What is the best form of government?</HI>" seems as far from being determined as ever; the politicians of different nations not having come to any compromise on this important subject. The reason, I suppose is, because no form of government can be devised that shall necessarily involve in itself the happiness or unhappiness of the people. There is, in fact, no mechanical affinity between these two objects. The multitude are happy or not, according to their ideas of the go∣vernment by which they are restrained; and these ideas are not the produce of speculative knowledge, but are derived from the prejudices of education: whilst the more enlightened judge of government by the manner in which its powers are exercised and justice administered. So that instead of deter∣mining on the happiness of a people by the nature of their political constitution, we should reverse the position, and judge of their political constituti∣on by its effects on the people; or, in other words, that is the best government which is best admini∣stered. This truth seems to be generally admitted by writers on the subject. The pursuit now, is not for a form of government that shall necessarily and mechanically make the people most happy; but for such a constitution as may be most effectual in securing them from being made miserable.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="024407_0590_0FC6F91F0DA360F8"/><HI>GREAT-BRITAIN</HI> is, I believe, the only nation that hath fairly tried the experiment. All other governments, that I know of, have certain desig∣nated characters: they are either despotic, monar∣chical, aristocratical, or democratical. But the English constitution is none of these, and yet par∣takes of the nature of each. Their writers tell us, that by mixing the forms, they enjoy all their re∣spective advantages, and that they reciprocally check each other, so as to counteract all their pe∣culiar dangers and inconveniences.</P>
<P>ALL this is made very clear in theory; but if we attend to facts, we shall find that the scheme does not fully answer the great purposes it seems to promise. Their history is a proof; wherein we see perpetual struggles between the crown and the people for encroachments of power on the one hand, or an extension of privileges on the other: and their annual publications, and frequent changes of men in office, in modern as well as ancient times, shew them to be subject to all the evils of faction and instability. The truth is, that so nice an ad∣justment of so complicated a machine—such a due proportion of strength in the component parts that they shall not interfere with or impede each other —such an accurate disposition of heterogeneous powers, that each shall naturally find out its own
<PB N="198" REF="024407_0591_0FC6F9206BCE0510"/>
specific gravity, and rest in quiet, can only exist in theory; the passions of mankind will ever prevent its continuance in fact.</P>
<P>DON'T be alarmed: I am not going to discuss this intricate subject at large; I wonder how I got so far into it: I have neither leisure, inclination, or ability to pursue it. I had fixed my attention only on one particular part of the English constitution, on which I mean to give you my sentiments; and respecting this, I have been for some weeks past making assiduous and minute enquiries—I mean the <HI>administration of justice by grand and petit juries.</HI></P>
<P>I must first give you as concise a detail as I can of this establishment, that you may the better un∣derstand my observations upon it.</P>
<P><HI>GRAND JURIES</HI> are only made use of in cases of criminal process, or public offence; <HI>petit juries</HI> in all cases of trial, whether for a breach of the laws, for private wrongs, or property in dispute. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There are some species of trials in England, where juries are not concerned; but it is not necessary to enumerate them here, as my present object is only the trial by juries.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE sheriff of the county or district, in pursu∣ance
<PB N="199" REF="024407_0592_0FC6F921DB0F1FC0"/>
of a writ directed to him by the judges, makes out a list of 24 honest and substantial free-holders, that is men of character, who possess a real or land∣ed estate in the county. To each of these he sends a written or printed notice to attend the court on a certain day. If the sheriff does his duty, these ought to be men most respectable for property, in∣tegrity, and abilities; so that poverty may not in∣duce them to a corrupt abuse of their office, or ig∣norance lead them to an absurd exercise of it.</P>
<P>NOT less than twelve, or more than twenty-three, are competent to the formation of a grand jury. Generally from fifteen to eighteen are considered as a suitable number.</P>
<P>WHEN these are convened in court, the oath of office is administered to them, which is a very strict one. They swear that they will not accuse any person for hatred or malice; or suffer any of∣fender to escape unaccused from any favour or af∣fection, or hope of reward. Thus qualified they retire to any apartment they please to perform the duty the law hath assigned to them.</P>
<P>THEY are called the <HI>grand inquest</HI> for the coun∣ty: because it is their business to enquire of all of∣fences that may have been committed within that
<PB N="200" REF="024407_0593_0FC6F9237425DA80"/>
district, and present them to the notice of the court. They are to receive information from every source; but particularly from the officer called the <HI>king's attorney,</HI> or the prosecutor in behalf of government. The bills of accusation are all framed by this offi∣cer, who sends them to the grand jury for enquiry, together with the witnesses in support of the bills.</P>
<P>THE jury then proceed to make a careful inves∣tigation of the charge, to examine the witnesses, and consider the whole matter in a large and liberal view; but the accused person is not suffered to ap∣pear and make his defence, this not being the time assigned for that purpose.</P>
<P>IF the grand jury, or a majority of them, find suf∣ficient cause to believe that the party is guilty of the crimes alledged against him, their foreman, in behalf of the whole body, endorses on the bill <HI>billa vera,</HI> or <HI>a true bill;</HI> if otherwise, he endorses the word <HI>ignoramus,</HI> as much as to say, this charge may be true, but we do not know that it is so. The rejection of a bill by the grand jury does not operate as an acquittal; for the party may be again indicted for the same offence, if fuller testimony in support of the accusation can afterwards be pro∣cured.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="024407_0594_0FC6F928F8A94B78"/>THE bills, thus endorsed, are brought into court and delivered to the judges. The party against whom the bill is found (as it is called) must be then sent for, and personally appear in court. If this cannot be done, the trial must be put off till he can be taken and brought to answer.</P>
<P>WHEN the accused person appears, the bill, now called an <HI>indictment,</HI> is distinctly read to him by the clerk of the court, who peremptorily demands of him whether he is <HI>guilty</HI> or <HI>not guilty</HI> of the charge as laid in the indictment. If the party absolutely re∣fuses to answer, the court cannot, according to the strict rules of common law, proceed against him; because he does not voluntarily submit his cause to that jurisdiction, by assenting to or denying the ac∣cusation: for the law does not allow that any court hath an official power to determine on a man's life or property, unless by his own act he consents, or seems to consent, to submit himself to its jurisdicti∣on; and this is supposed to be done by his enter∣ing his plea, that is, by acknowledging or denying the charge brought against him.</P>
<P>THERE have been instances in former times of persons standing <HI>mute,</HI> and refusing to plead to the indictment; to remedy which, a most absurd and barbarous practice was admitted to enforce an an∣swer.
<PB N="202" REF="024407_0595_0FC6F92BB42ED360"/>
The party was taken to prison, and laid upon his back, naked, on the floor of a dungeon, his arms and legs were tied by four cords to the four corners of the dungeon: he was sparingly fed with the most coarse and ordinary bread that could be got, and drink brought him from the nearest ken∣nel; a weight was also laid upon his breast, and a like weight daily added, until, by his intolerable situation, he was compelled to answer <HI>guilty</HI> or <HI>not guilty.</HI> This operation is called in their books <HI>paine forte &amp; dure.</HI> But this savage process is now obsolete: and it is declared by statute, that stand∣ing obstinately mute shall be an equivalent to a confession of guilt, and sentence shall be passed ac∣cordingly. The case never occurs now. The pri∣soner generally pleads <HI>not guilty,</HI> and is thereby said to join in issue, and put himself upon his trial. If he is a stranger, or so poor that he cannot en∣gage an advocate to assist him in his defence, the judges always assign him council, and allow him some short time for preparation.</P>
<P>WHEN the day of trial comes, the prisoner is again sent for to court; for it is essential to the process that he should be personally present during the whole business. The sheriff hath previously summoned a number of persons to serve on the <HI>pe∣tit jury.</HI> Twelve persons, and no more, are neces∣sary
<PB N="203" REF="024407_0596_0FC6F93032C88CA0"/>
for this purpose; but he generally returns forty-eight or more names to the court, according to circumstances, because the accused hath a right to make many objections. These names are called over in court, and the persons who appear are pre∣sented one by one before the prisoner, who is de∣sired to look at him, and say whether he has any objection to his being one of the jury which is to determine his fate. If the crime charged is capital, the prisoner has a legal right to <HI>challenge perempto∣rily</HI> twenty of the persons offered for jurymen, that is, to set them aside from caprice, from a dislike to their countenances, or any other secret motive, without giving any reason for his so doing; and he has, moreover, a right to challenge or object to as many more as he ran give sufficient reasons for rejecting: such as the person offered being in any degree interested in the event; his having pre∣judged the matter, by declaring his opinion in conversation; his having heretofore been convict∣ed of perjury, with many other causes of legal disability.</P>
<P>WHEN this investigation is gone through, and twelve unexceptionable persons appear, who have all been sworn, <HI>well and truly to try the cause de∣pending, and a true verdict give according to the evidence,</HI> they are put together in a convenient
<PB N="204" REF="024407_0597_0FC6F931C8583B00"/>
place, to hear the whole matter, and must not se∣parate until a final decision is given; nor must any person whisper or speak to them (except when they ask questions of the court or of the witnesses) or deliver any message or writing to them; any of these happening would vitiate the whole process. Yet the judges, the lawyers employed, or the pri∣soner, may address them aloud in open court. If a juryman should have occasion to retire during the trial, he must ask leave of the court, and a constable must attend him the whole time of his absence, and the proceedings must be suspended till his return.</P>
<P>THE trial commences by the king's attorney<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Or the clerk of the court for him.</NOTE> reading the indictment aloud to the jury: after which he produces his witnesses in support of the accusation. These witnesses must all be examined on oath, and deliver their testimony <HI>viva voce</HI> in the presence of the prisoner, and of the whole court. After the king's attorney hath done with a witness, the advocate for the prisoner cross examines him: he asks him questions which may tend to embarrass him: he presses him as to the certainty of his knowledge: he endeavours to make him contra∣dict himself; or say something that may indicate

passion or interest; and exercises every art that may tend to invalidate his testimony, or weaken its force. If these manoeuvres, however, are carried too far, the judge will, or ought to, interfere, and check a too great licentiousness in the treatment of a witness. When the king's attorney hath pro∣duced all his testimony, he addresses the jury; he recapitulates what the witnesses have advanced; he enforces the law, and applies it to the present case; and supports his arguments by authorities from the books respecting cases of the like na∣ture.</P>
<P>THE council for the prisoner then produces his witnesses in behalf of the accused, who are also se∣verally cross examined by the king's attorney. When the whole of the testimony has been exhibi∣ted, of which the judges and the council take notes in writing, the lawyer for the prisoner begins his defence: he dwells upon, and enforces every fa∣vourable circumstance: he endeavours to invali∣date or throw doubts upon the proofs against him: he labours to explain away the law, and finally addresses himself to the tender feelings of the jury. He must now display the whole of his abilities, for he is not allowed to speak again. The king's at∣torney then replies; he obviates the objections that have been made, either to the testimony or to
<PB N="206" REF="024407_0599_0FC6F93568E5DD28"/>
his statement of the law; he points at the weak∣ness of the defence; and enlarges upon the proof against the prisoner; and, lastly, submits the whole matter to the determination of the jury.</P>
<P>THERE is then a customary, but not a necessary, indulgence allowed to the prisoner in capital cases: and this I think a very pathetic part of the process. The accused person has been all this time a silent spectator of the proceedings; but he is now permitted to address the jury himself, and tell his own story in his own way.</P>
<P>THIS, considering his critical situation, is cer∣tainly a very interesting part of the ceremony; es∣pecially if the party is indeed innocent of the crime alledged, but labouring under a combina∣tion of unlucky circumstances and untoward ap∣pearances. I have been more affected by the sim∣ple narrative of the prisoner himself, than by all the finished eloquence of the council who under∣took his defence.</P>
<P>AFTER this, the judge sums up the whole of the testimony to the jury: he omits unnecessary de∣tails, and brings pointedly into view all those cir∣cumstances which are of any importance either for or against the prisoner: and opens and ex∣plains
<PB N="207" REF="024407_0600_0FC6F939DF6CFF88"/>
the law, if in the least doubtful, and often instructs the jury what determination they ought, in his opinion, to give.</P>
<P>THE jury, being now charged with the whole matter, are conducted to some private apartment, where they are shut up, and a constable is placed on the out side of the door; and there they must remain, secluded from all external communi∣cation whatever, without meat, drink or suste∣nance of any kind until they shall have <HI>unanimously</HI>
agreed in their judgment. Any <HI>one</HI> dissenting voice will annihilate the verdict or decision. When they have all agreed, they give notice thereof to the constable at the door, who immediately sends information to the judge. The court, if not then sitting, forthwith convenes, and the prisoner is again sent for; for it is absolutely necessary that the verdict should be given in his presence. The jury then come into court, and the clerk having called over their names, to shew that none are mis∣sing, asks them if they have agreed in their ver∣dict?—they answer in the affirmative. He then demands of them, whether the prisoner is <HI>guilty</HI>
or <HI>not guilty</HI> of the crime with which he stands charged?—to which the foreman of the jury, in behalf of the rest, answers <HI>guilty</HI> or <HI>not guilty,</HI> as the case may be. This the clerk immediately re∣cords;
<PB N="208" REF="024407_0601_0FC6F93C2575C860"/>
and then desires the jury to attend to their verdict, as the court hath recorded it, demanding assent, which is again given.</P>
<P>THIS determination is called a <HI>verdict,</HI> or <HI>vere-dictum.</HI> Because the law presumes that what∣ever twelve impartial men, so selected, so sworn, and so instructed, shall, with united voice, declare, must inevitably be the truth: neither will the law suffer a verdict, so given and recorded, to be after∣wards doubted or contested.</P>
<P>IF the prisoner has been found <HI>guilty,</HI> the judge asks him what he has to say why the sentence of the law should not be pronounced against him? For, even in this last stage, the prisoner may, if he can, shew some defect in the proceedings, some uncer∣tainty in the indictment, or other irregularity of force sufficient to arrest the judgment. For when the law presumes that the jury have de∣livered the truth, it supposes the whole proceed∣ings to have been fair, regular and legal; other∣wise the verdict is not founded on such a basis as the law requires, and therefore is not that legal un∣controvertible truth it looks for. If the prisoner has no such plea to make, judgement is pronoun∣ced against him; and he has no chance left but that of the king's pardon.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="024407_0602_0FC6F93EA9C2C7D8"/>THERE are several minutiae in this process, and some exceptions which I have omitted; but the above is the general outline of trial in criminal cases.</P>
<P>IN disputes about property, and actions for da∣mages, the same principle pervades the conduct of the suit; that is, to give the accused person all pos∣sible opportunity of defence. In civil causes, however, there is no grand jury; neither of the parties have a right to make peremptory challen∣ges; and the jury are not so rigidly treated as in cases of life and death; yet their determination or verdict must be <HI>unanimous,</HI> as in the former case; and there is no reversing their verdict, but by discovering some error in the proceedings, or some fraud or corruption in the jury</P>
<P>SUCH is the mode of administring justice in this country. A system which is deemed the palladi∣um of British liberty, and the subject of perpetual panegyrick. And no wonder; since, as a system, nothing can be more perfect; inasmuch as it is cal∣culated to shield the poorest individual in the community against the secret strokes of wealthy malice, or the open violence of overweening power.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="024407_0603_0FC6F94466230BD8"/>BUT I have given you a delineation of what the practice ought to be, not what it may be. If the several parts of this machine should in all instances operate according to their respective destinations, and no further, it would be very difficult for a guilty per∣son to escape, and next to impossible that an innocent man should suffer: and in contests about property, there would be the greatest reason to expect that impartial and substantial justice must take place.</P>
<P>I could myself enlarge, with the zeal of an En∣glishman, on the external beauty of this admirable fabric, and its apparent strength as a bulwark a∣gainst oppression. But let us now consider the dis∣eases to which this constitution is liable, and how far the good purposes of an excellent theory may be evaded or perverted in the execution.</P>
<P>IN the first place, the sheriff selects and returns such persons as he pleases to serve on both juries: and here he has uncontrolled opportunity of gra∣tifying his own partialities, if he has any, respecting the persons to be tried, or the cause depending: for it matters not what private passions or prejudi∣ces the juries may have, provided they are <HI>legally</HI>
unexceptionable; and popular governments are so subject to party rage, that such partialities in the sheriff may sometimes be expected.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="024407_0604_0FC6F94695968510"/>INDEED, it is not uncommon for people here to form a judgment of the issue of a doubtful cause, from a knowledge of the jury which is to deter∣mine it. It is to guard against the sheriff's <HI>packing</HI>
a jury, as it is called, that peremptory challenges are allowed in capital cases.</P>
<P>WHEN the grand jury is formed, the judge al∣ways addresses them from the bench. This is cal∣led charging the grand jury, and should, according to the original design, be no more than a general delineation of their duty, and the law definitions of the crimes and offences of which they are to make enquiry, and present to the jurisdiction of the court: because these men being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elected from the mass of the people, are not supposed to be versed in legal precision and niceties. But the judge often takes this opportunity of going farther: he insinuates to them, that they may indict on mere <HI>probable</HI> testi∣mony; that they should attend only to the testimo∣ny in behalf of the prosecution, and have nothing to do with any witnesses but those whom the king's attorney shall send to them; and that if they find the bill, it will amount to nothing more than a kind of legal accusation, which, if wrong, will be afterwards set right by the petit jury. But this is a deviation from the original constitution, which placed the grand jury at the first entrance
<PB N="212" REF="024407_0605_0FC6F9476194A248"/>
of the law to screen the innocent from malicious prosecutions. For what with confinement, ex∣pence, and infamy, a man may be effectually ruin∣ed by the grand jury's finding a bill against him, although he may be afterwards fully acquitted by the petit jury.</P>
<P>THUS charged, however, the grand jury retire. Now it should be considered that these are called off from their ordinary business to perform a tem∣porary duty, not very agreeable in itself, and at∣tended with no profit; but, on the contrary, some∣what expensive. The ideas they have imbibed from the charge, have a great tendency to relax the binding force of their oath of office: their present duty is in the law line, and they do not pretend to understand law: but the judge who does under∣stand it, has instructed them; and on his opinion they rest the sanctity of their oath, and the rights of their station. When such principles prevail, the real use of a grand jury is in a great measure set aside, and the institution becomes rather a burthen∣some ceremony, than a real advantage.</P>
<P>THE judge has a manifest influence over both the grand and petit juries; but he must exercise this with moderation and discretion; for the peo∣ple have in general a pretty just knowledge of
<PB N="113" REF="024407_0606_0FC6F952548480A0"/>
their fundamental rights; these they will suffer to be impaired through indolence, inattention, or per∣suasion, but will never suffer them to be directly violated or called in question. The judge may insinuate any thing, but if he openly assumes un∣constitutional powers over the jury, he is sure to be opposed with invincible firmness. And when ever an open contest of this kind happens, the ju∣ry will certainly have the popular current in their favour, unless they should be so notoriously in the the wrong as to preclude all defence of their conduct.</P>
<P>THE petit jury, are now to be formed, or, as it is called, <HI>impannelled.</HI> And here again is a large field for contrivance and address. In suits for damages or for property, great dexterity is ex∣ercised on both sides for securing proper men on the jury. So great are the apprehensions of un∣fairness and disadvantage in this particular, that it is common for the parties in the suit to demand that the cause shall be tried by what is called a <HI>struck jury.</HI> When this happens the prothonotary, or clerk of the court, makes out a list of 48 good and law∣ful men of the county, and from this list the par∣ties, or their attornies for them, alternately strike out the names of such as they do not approve until there are but 24 names left. These
<PB N="214" REF="024407_0607_0FC6F954DC714BB8"/>
24 are summoned by the sheriff to attend the court, and the first 12 of the number who shall make their appearance on the day of trial, and answer to their names, are to compose the jury who are to determine the cause.</P>
<P>AFTER the jury have been impannelled, have heard the testimony and the arguments, and the judge has summed up the whole matter, they retire to form their verdict. For this pur∣pose, as I before observed, they are excluded from all external communication, sustenance, or comfort. By these means they are compelled to make up a unanimous opinion or starve, be the case never so doubtful or difficult. In this lies the principal fallacy of the system; inasmuch as it is next to an impossibility that twelve men, of various tempers, abilities and knowledge, should freely and decidedly unite in judgment on a disputable and uncertain case. The truth is, they seldom suffer any great extremities for conscience sake<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>"And wretches hang, that jurymen may dine."</P>
<BIBL><HI>Garth.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. The last impressions they received came from the judge; his station, his authority, his knowledge in the law, will give an almost invincible force to these impressions. And the result is, that nine times in ten, the verdict, especially in civil cases, is made conformably to his opinion.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="024407_0608_0FC6F95667C85F38"/>THE designated legal power of an English judge is not very considerable; but the <HI>official influence</HI>
he has over the determinations of juries, subjects, in a great degree, the lives and property of the people to his judgment or caprice. And this masked power is the more dangerous; because, if he should be partial, unjust, or corrupt, his conduct is screened by the intervention of the jury, the fi∣nal decision being their verdict, not his.</P>
<P>BUT suppose the judge states the case impar∣tially to the jury, without making any attempt to bias their judgment; the consequence is, that some leading man in the jury will bring over the rest to his opinion, or some very obstinate man wear out the patience of his fellows. There have been instances when eleven have agreed upon a verdict and the persevering twelfth has com∣pelled them to change their minds, and yield to the superior strength of his constitution. It of∣ten happens that a verdict is put to the vote, and the minority accedes to the opinion of the majority. But most commonly the verdict is determined by the advice of the judge, or the opinion of one of the jury of more reputed knowledge than the rest. So that in disputable cases, it seldom, if ever, happens that the final verdict is that free, clear, and una∣nimous decision of twelve impartial men, under
<PB N="216" REF="024407_0609_0FC6F95B0296B458"/>
oath, which the law presumes, and which the sy∣stem requires. If two or more of the jury should be of contrary opinions, and neither will give way, no verdict can possibly be given in. In such a case, which sometimes occurs, there is but one remedy, which indeed is not countenanced by law, but suggested by necessity. It is this. The sheriff, or some body for him, steals away one of the jury from the bar, so that when the clerk calls over their names, it is found that there are but eleven jurymen, and this invalidates all the proceedings. The business must be put off to another court, and the whole process begun <HI>de novo.</HI></P>
<P>IF, when the verdict is given in, the judge should not approve of it, he sometimes takes the liberty of sending back the jury to reconsider the mat∣ter; but if they persist, he must finally submit and record the verdict. But such cases seldom occur. In general the juries take their tone from the judge's charge. When they have given in their decision, they are discharged, and disperse, and are never after accountable for what they have done, unless in cases of manifest corruption. It is with them, as with all popular bodies—the individuals never think themselves responsible for what the whole have done.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="024407_0610_0FC6F95C7086BAC0"/>IN causes which do not so much depend upon expositions of law, such as an equitable adjustment of long and intricate accounts, or satisfaction for injuries which cannot so well be ascertained by le∣gal testimony, it is customary for the contend∣ing parties to consent in open court to a reference. Whereupon the judges nominate three or more in∣different persons to hear and arbitrate the matters in variance. These arbitrators are not compelled to be unanimous, neither are they subjected to the other restrictions of a jury. They meet when and where they please, they investigate the busi∣ness in their own manner, and in their own time, and finally send their award in writing to the court. And this award, when received and re∣corded, becomes the judgment of the court.</P>
<P>ARBITRATIONS are liable to this imperfection. The arbitrators not having the opinion of the judge to rest upon, not being restrained by rigid rules, being few in number, and moving in an enlarged sphere of investigation, are more pointed∣ly and personally answerable, in reputation at least, for the rectitude and propriety of their de∣termination. In this situation, the general aim, in difficult cases is, if possible, to satisfy both the contending parties, and so avoid the complaints or censures of either; and this they frequently ac∣complish
<PB N="218" REF="024407_0611_0FC6F95DF4948A70"/>
by halving the value in dispute between them, when it can be done; and thus substantial justice is done to neither.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH the English law leans so strongly in favour of the accused in criminal cases, giving every reasonable advantage to the party who is put up∣on his defence, yet the form of process is so decid∣ed, and so well understood, that unnecessary delays seldom occur; but this is far from being the case in civil actions, which are attended with so many complex circumstances, forms, and delays, all which incur a considerable expence, that the plaintiff, unless in very plain cases, such as an un∣disputed bond, or note of hand, had better put up with a small injury or loss, than to prosecute his suit, although in the end he should prove successful. For here the the law is so unreasonably in favour of the defendant, and allows him so many dilatory pleas, causes of adjournment, and removals from court to court, that a wealthy wrong-doer, with the help of able council, may weary out the most equitable claimant by exhausting his patience and his purse.</P>
<P>WHEN an action is brought, the right or wrong of the case, or what is called the me∣rits of the cause, never come into view till to∣wards
<PB N="219" REF="024407_0612_0FC6F9641D5191C8"/>
the close of the business. The only ques∣tion is, whether the plaintiff hath brought, and conducted his claim, according to the strict forms of law, which forms are not settled by any code or determinate system; but must be gathered from the authorities, that is, from the reports of former determinations when like points of process have been contested. The intention of throwing these obstacles in the way of justice is to prevent the plaintiff from over-reaching the defendant in any stage of the process. But the evils attending this extreme caution are more than a balance to the dangers it is designed to obviate.</P>
<P>IT would be in vain for me to give you the hi∣story of the many causes of delay that may legal∣ly occur in the pursuit of a manifestly equitable title to a tract of land, whole volumes would be insufficient to the purpose; my present object on∣ly respects the mode of trial by jury, not the ge∣neral practice of the law in this country.</P>
<P>THE result of my observations amounts to this, that perfection is not to be looked for in human institutions. The British form of govern∣ment, as well as British jurisprudence, exhibits a specious appearance of perfect security to the sub∣ject; but this perfect security exists only in the
<PB N="220" REF="024407_0613_0FC6F96675A24538"/>
theory; the proposed object of the system is to ensure to the people all the good effects of wisdom and integrity in their rulers and officers of justice; but wisdom and integrity are absolutely necessary to the due execution of the plan. So that the effects promised must in fact precede the opera∣tion; which is a political <HI>petitio principii.</HI></P>
<P>IN England, all laws are supposed to be made by the free consent of the people, by means of their representatives; and judical decisions to be the verdict of twelve impartial men, unanimous in their opinions. Neither of these positions are strictly true in fact. It is most notorious, that, in the first case, the members of parliament fre∣quently purchase the voices of the people, and af∣terwards sell their own and votes to the king or his minister; so that the king can almost al∣ways command a majority of parliamentary voices. And, in the second case, the authority of the judge most commonly influences the verdict of a jury; so that in truth, the king makes the laws, and the judges execute them, whilst the people only <HI>seem</HI> to do both;—and they remain content with this <HI>seeming,</HI> until administration becomes too manifestly oppressive and corrupt. When this happens they struggle for original rights, by
<PB N="221" REF="024407_0614_0FC6F9691A719B88"/>
insurrections and revolutions; which is the po∣pular remedy common to every government, when that government is so exercised as to become in∣supportable.</P>
<P>THESE remarks may perhaps appear too se∣vere, but they are founded in truth. A candid Englishman would acknowledge, that the imper∣fections I have pointed at, may, and sometimes do, occur in their political system; but he would urge, and with some reason too, that, all circum∣stances considered, all evils balanced, and all in∣conveniences averaged, the constitution of his country is the safest and best yet devised for uni∣ting these two difficult problems—<HI>The security of the people's rights, with the dignity and vigour of government.</HI></P>
<P>I will readily acknowledge, that, upon the whole, justice is well admininistred in this country; but I believe this is more owing to the abilities and integrity of their judges, than to the infallibility of their system. A bad judge might be a curse to the people, without directly violating the legal rules of his official conduct.</P>
<P>FOR my own part, I am of opinion, that the happiness of a people depends more upon their
<PB N="222" REF="024407_0615_0FC6F971EF79E670"/>
national character than their form of government. A truly enlightened people cannot be enslaved real despotism cannot be exercised, unless the mass of the people are either stupidly ignorant, grossly licentious and immoral, or extremely begotted. In the first case, they submit to every imposition, because they know nothing of the rights of na∣ture, or the origin of delegated power; in the second, they become enervated by luxury, and indifferent to those rights and privileges, of which they have rendered themselves unworthy; and, in the third, their tyrant will take care to have the priesthood on his side, and make the consciences of his subjects the chains by which he will hold them in the most abject servitude; or, which is not improbable, the priesthood will be themselves the tyrants, and keep both the so∣v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ign and his people under a most rigid con∣troul.</P>
<P>OF all the means by which a nation may be made miserable, this last is the most wicked and most effectual. Freed from this servitude, a peo∣ple cannot, in this age of the world, long remain either stupidly ignorant, or grossly immoral; but inexorable bigotry and rooted superstition lock up the doors of knowledge and preclude reformation.
<PB N="223" REF="024407_0616_0FC6F973A21893A0"/>
No nation was ever famous for advancements in arts and sciences, for discoveries in the truths of nature which enlarge the mind, or the inventions of improvements, which add to the happiness or convenience of mankind, whilst they were compel∣led by the prejudices of education, or the rigour of the laws, to yield implicit faith and obedience to the priesthood—Quere—Which was the most beneficial character to the world—the man who invented the <HI>Spinning wheel,</HI> or he who compo∣sed the <HI>Athanasian Creed?</HI></P>
<P>BUT I am wandering far from my subject, and have unexpectedly made my letter of an unrea∣sonable length. Had I foreseen how far my disser∣tation on jury trials would have led me, I should probably not have undertaken it.</P>

<P>☞ AN attack was made upon the Bank of North America, by a then prevailing party. <HI>Mr. T.

This performance occasioned the following ironical answer; which, however, was never published; as the succeeding house of assembly soon repealed the act for disfranchising that institution.</P>

<P>IT is said of <HI>Archimedes,</HI> that he would have un∣dertaken to move the globe of the earth, provided a place could be had whereon he might erect his machine. So it is with speculative authors in every
<PB N="226" REF="024407_0619_0FC6F97C9DF70D10"/>
science. Grant them only a few first principles or <HI>data,</HI> so called, because they must depend upon the reader's benevolence for admission, being either not true in fact, or incapable of proof; I say, grant but these, and the subsequent reasoning cannot ea∣sily be controverted. Give an ingenious author a point whereon to rest the fulcrum of his argument, and he will move whole systems, physical, moral, or political.</P>
<P>THE manifest purpose of the pamphlet before me is to justify the <HI>Bank of North-America</HI> as a use∣ful institution, notwithstanding that it hath been declared by act of assembly to be a pernicious cor∣poration, and incompatible with the public safety; and to shew that the legislature had no legal right to deprive it of its charter; and also to censure and ridicule a respectable committee of the house, upon whose report the act for disfranchising the bank was founded.</P>
<P>IN order to prove that the assembly had no right to retract a charter once granted, without some legal forfeiture or breach of conditions on the part of the grantees, he rests the fulcrum of his argu∣ments on certain first principles of government. Now, if these first principles should be found on ex∣amination to be laid on hollow ground; that is, that
<PB N="227" REF="024407_0620_0FC6F97E1D5DC6C8"/>
however true they may be in reason, they are not true in fact, it will follow, that the author, the pam∣phlet, the argument, and the bank of North-Ame∣rica, must all sink together—Let us then take a short view of this writer's ground work.</P>
<P><HI>COMMON-SENSE</HI> tells us, that in all governments there must be a sovereign power somewhere, and that the repository where this sovereignty is placed is the first criterion of distinction between a despo∣tic form of government and a free country: that in the first, it is possessed by an individual in here∣ditary right; in the second, it is held by the peo∣ple at large, and by them periodically assigned to their delegates or representatives.</P>
<P>THE fallacy of this supposed axiom consists in his considering sovereign power as a simple elemen∣tary principle; whereas it is manifestly divisible in∣to at least two component parts: viz. <HI>power,</HI> con∣sidered only in reference to the act or thing done, or to be done; and <HI>will,</HI> considered as influencing and dictating the exercise of that power. For in∣stance, in a mill, the <HI>power</HI> of grinding corn is in the stones, wheels, and movements of the machine; but the <HI>will</HI> is in the miller, who superintends and go∣verns its operations.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="024407_0621_0FC6F98419673068"/>A mere act of <HI>power</HI> may be exercised without the concurrence of the <HI>will</HI>: and that there may be a <HI>will,</HI> without a <HI>power</HI> to carry it into effect, will not be denied. Now the true criterion of distincti∣on between a despotic rule and the free govern∣ment of Pennsylvania consists in this; that in the former case, the <HI>will</HI> and <HI>power</HI> are both inherent in an individual and his successors; whereas in Pennsylvania, the <HI>power</HI> of making laws is in the house of assembly; but the <HI>will</HI> that suggests, dictates to, and influences this <HI>power,</HI> is lodg∣ed with certain learned and worthy persons, who are not members of that house, and who are not vested with the power of actually making laws.</P>
<P>I begin to perceive that I have involved myself in a very difficult and subtle argument—I wish I may be able to make myself understood.</P>
<P>A majority of voices in the house of assembly have an undoubted right to order the seals of the commonwealth to be affixed to a bill which hath previously passed the forms of legislation. The seals being thus affixed, that bill becomes a law, binding on all whom it may concern, being citizens of the state. Now this is a mere naked act of <HI>power,</HI> the authenticity of which does not at all depend on a
<PB N="229" REF="024407_0622_0FC6F9866F5FCAD8"/>
genuine concurrence of <HI>will</HI> in those who exercise it; for the <HI>will</HI> is either directly or remotely the offspring of the understanding; yet the law would be valid, although the majority that voted it into existence, should be totally ignorant of its principles and operation.</P>
<P>I will put a case, which I confess, is a very ab∣surd one; but it will serve to illustrate my argu∣ment.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE a contest should arise respecting the true translation of a passage in the original Hebrew bible; and that this difference of opinion should occasion such hot disputes and angry parties in the state as to make it necessary for the legislature to interfere and determine the point. Suppose innumerable petitions <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con</HI> to be laid before the house, and that at last a committee should be appointed to <HI>enquire</HI> and report upon the merits of the question. This committee having no know∣ledge of the Hebrew tongue will naturally apply to some learned men—heads of one of the parties, but not members of the house, who will tell them—
<Q>This is a business you do not understand—as∣semblymen never read Hebrew, they only read newspapers—but we will draw up a report for you.</Q>
The report is accordingly drawn up by

these learned men—the committee adopt it—they lay it before the house—a bill is drawn conforma∣bly thereto, and passed into a law, and so the ques∣tion is decided. Now, in this transaction there is a manifest separation of the <HI>will</HI> from the <HI>power.</HI> The committee had the power of presenting the report, and the house of passing it into a law; but neither the committee nor the house could possibly exercise any <HI>will</HI> on a subject of which they had not the least knowledge or understanding. Their <HI>will</HI> might, indeed, be exercised in the service of the party they wished to favour, but not in the decision of the question.</P>
<P>On these principles I venture to assert in vindi∣cation of a late committee on the affairs of the bank, against the aspersions of <HI>Common Sense,</HI> that, let their report be proper or improper, let the law passed thereupon be just or unjust, no censure can possibly lie against the committee, because, some few instances excepted, no man is responsible for an act in which his <HI>will</HI> did not concur.</P>
<P>BUT the committee does not stand in need of this or any other defence: their report was per∣fectly just and proper, and exhibited an intimate knowledge of the constitution and tendency of the bank of North-America: as I shall fully shew
<PB N="231" REF="024407_0624_0FC6F98ED2C69C30"/>
when I come to enumerate the high crimes of the president, directors, and stockholders of our national bank.</P>
<P>SOVEREIGNTY being thus divisible into <HI>will</HI> and <HI>power,</HI> the advantage of our free government con∣sists in this, that let who will exercise the <HI>power</HI> in the house of legislation, the <HI>will</HI> of government may be possessed by worthy and enterprising men out of the house, by which the labour of law-mak∣ing is divided and becomes easy and advantageous.</P>
<P>ON this singularity in our political system is founded a doctrine, not long since advanced by learned men, which, if established, must fully answer the purposes of those who discovered it, viz. that assemblies, juries, and such confidential appoint∣ments are nothing more than LEGAL MACHINES, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Vol. I. p. 205</NOTE>
designed to give legal sanction to the views of those, who from superior abilities and official greatness, are best qualified to influence and direct them. It would be a strange thing indeed if the mill should grind what sort of grain it pleased, and go, or stop, according to its own caprices.</P>
<P>THAT <HI>Common Sense</HI> has taken a wrong ground of argument is plain from this. He gives a copy
<PB N="232" REF="024407_0625_0FC6F99023607CF0"/>
our bill of rights, and from thence deduces his system of reasoning. It had been more to the purpose, if, instead of a bill of <HI>rights,</HI> he had given us a bill of <HI>facts.</HI> A bill of rights is a very useful thing in the commencement of a common∣wealth; like leading strings for a child it assists it in walking before it has strength to go alone. But when the government is established, what occasion can there be for a bill of rights? When the house is built, the scaffolding should be taken away. When the Ship is launched, she leaves her former supports behind.</P>
<P>IT may be asked if the bill of rights and our frame of government are no longer to be regar∣ded, where shall we look for a rule of conduct?</P>
<P>I answer, <HI>precedent</HI> will always furnish sufficient rules of conduct. In the commencement of a republic, it is plain there can be no <HI>precedents:</HI>
all things are then new; and a bill of rights, and a designated constitution, must be the standards of authority. As the republic advances in strength and stability, <HI>precedents</HI> sprout spontaneously, kill the roots of original rights, and in time occupy the whole ground. The only difficulty is to create and establish the first precedent. This done, it
<PB N="233" REF="024407_0626_0FC6F991B00D6058"/>
will soon become a powerful engine. Like an anchor to windward, it will enable the skilful pilot to warp the ship against wind and tide. It will also prove very prolific; for a good <HI>precedent,</HI> like a good potatoe, contains within itself the eyes or germs of many future precedents or potatoes.</P>
<P>FOR example—In an early period of our politi∣cal existence it seemed no great impropriety that committees of the house of assembly should take the opinions of the judges on questions respecting mere law-points. But this soon grew to a custom of sending not questions only, but the bills them∣selves, to the judges for consideration. Thus en∣couraged, their honours soon undertook to recom∣mend, and even draw petitions to the assembly for or against measures which they wished to promote or oppose; to frame reports for committees; and originated bills for the legislature; and to esta∣blish, by <HI>precedent,</HI> an out-of-doors influence, so strong as virtually to possess the <HI>will</HI> of govern∣ment; leaving to the house of assembly the more <HI>mechanical power</HI> of enacting laws.</P>
<P>THUS hath a total change, in effect, taken place in our constitution. We began with a sin∣gle branch of legislation, and it is manifest that we
<PB N="234" REF="024407_0627_0FC6F997305346E0"/>
have now three distinct branches, viz. an upper house, a lower house, and a legislative council. Our upper house, it is well known, meet at the state house in Chesnut Street; the lower house assemble at the Indian Queen in Market Street<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The members of assembly, who at this time combined to form a majority in the house, used to meet in the evening at the Indian Queen, and there debate on questions which were to be agitated next day in the house. After debate, the question was put to vote, and the then minority were to vote next day in assembly, not ac∣cording to their own judgments, but according to this previous determination. Such was the compact between them. See Page 86.</NOTE>, and the judges from the supreme court form the legislative council. This council, in conjunction with the lower house, is the repository of the <HI>will</HI>
of our sovereignty, having a direct influence upon the acts of government whilst under deliberation. And the council have, by <HI>precedent,</HI> acquired a separate and exclusive right of <HI>revising, altering, and amending,</HI> the laws <HI>after they have been enacted and published.</HI> And thus hath our bill of <HI>facts</HI>
introduced a form of government very different from that designated in our bill of <HI>rights</HI> and ori∣ginal constitution.</P>
<P>HAVING shewn, to satisfaction I hope, that <HI>common Sense</HI> hath entirely mistaken the present constitution of Pennsylvania, it follows, that all
<PB N="235" REF="024407_0628_0FC6F99A0FAB8D08"/>
his arguments, founded on what our system of government <HI>was,</HI> instead of what <HI>it is,</HI> must fall to the ground. Amongst these, the first in rank is a subtile distinction between an <HI>act</HI> and a <HI>law.</HI> The design of which is to shew that there are not two sorts of justice in nature. That the same justice which binds individuals in a bargain, should bind the public in contracts. That the assembly, as the representative body of the people, have a right to make contracts with individuals, and that the party or parties contracted with, have an interest in the bargain, which they cannot justly be deprived of by a mere arbitrary change of opinion in the grantor. Because, such a con∣tract is an <HI>act,</HI> and not a <HI>law,</HI> subject to repeal at pleasure. And so applying this doctrine to the case of the bank, he infers that the assembly had no right to deprive that corporation of its character.</P>
<P>BUT the fallacy of this reasoning will appear, by considering the facts and principles just stated; I mean the separation of the <HI>will</HI> from the <HI>power,</HI> in the sovereignty of Pennsylvania.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE a remonstrance to be made to the house of assembly, representing, in strong and plausible terms, the injustice in thus depriving the
<PB N="236" REF="024407_0629_0FC6F99B646A8668"/>
bank of its charter, without any legal conviction of its offence, or forfeiture on the part of that insti∣tion; the natural answer would be,
<Q>the bu∣siness of this house is determined by a majority of voices; <HI>that</HI> majority is secured by the lower house, and influenced and directed by the legislative council. All the power we have is to enact laws, but what those laws shall be, depends upon those wise men who are in possession of the sovereignty of <HI>will.</HI> If any thing should be wrong, we are not responsible, being nothing more than <HI>legal machines.</HI> Go to those who direct our proceedings, and perhaps they may give you satisfaction.</Q></P>
<P>SHOULD application then be made to the lower house, and legislative council, they would say,
<Q>We have not the power to make laws, or to re∣peal them; we can neither give charters, nor take them away; the seals of the commonwealth are not in our possession; the house of assem∣bly is alone competent to your purpose.</Q></P>
<P>AND herein consists the excellency of our go∣vernment, that let things go a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they will, there is nobody to blame.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="024407_0630_0FC6F99E0C5906A8"/>THE distinction between an <HI>act</HI> and a <HI>law</HI> made by <HI>Common Sense</HI> has no real foundation; because he places what he calls an <HI>act</HI> of assembly upon the footing of a grant or contract not revocable at pleasure. But the binding force of all con∣tracts depends upon a concurrence of the <HI>will</HI> and the <HI>act.</HI> And, therefore, a grant, bond, or bar∣gain, executed under compulsions, restraint, or un∣due influence, is of no validity. Now, the <HI>will</HI>
being severed from the <HI>power,</HI> in our system of le∣gislation, it is impossible that acts of government should be no more than contracts. All acts of assembly are in fact <HI>laws,</HI> and as such, liable to be revised, amended, or totally repealed, let <HI>Common Sense</HI> say what he will.</P>
<P>IN the case of a grant or charter under speci∣fied conditions, there can be no doubt, but that the grantees are strictly bound by the terms men∣mentioned; but, it would be beneath the dignity of government, that it should be bound by any conditions whatever: <HI>sovereign power</HI> scorns restraint.</P>
<P>I well recollect, that, in an argument held before a la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e house of assembly, respecting the bank, the advocate for those who wished to overturn that in∣stitution, proceeded on the grounds and principles
<PB N="238" REF="024407_0631_0FC6F99F4DC93878"/>
I have above stated. Much was urged in favour of the <HI>power</HI> of the house. The same <HI>power,</HI> he said, that creates, can annihilate: it would be ab∣surd to say, that the legislature can <HI>do,</HI> but cannot <HI>undo;</HI> and so on. But, not a word of the justice or injustice, the morality, or immorality, of the trans∣action; for these concern the <HI>will</HI> and not the <HI>power,</HI> and were points on which the orator knew the house was not responsible, for the reasons I have given above. I remember also, that I ask∣ed a certain great lawyer <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Ch— J—.</NOTE>, at that time, whether he thought that house could repeal the law for emancipating negroes, and so make them slaves again? He answered, that it had a legal power so to do.</P>
<P>SINCE then all acts of the legislature are laws, and as such may be altered or repealed at pleasure, to what purpose has this author taken so much pains? Can a pamphlet invalidate a law of the land? Will our assembly-men be ruled by the dic∣tates of <HI>Common Sense?</HI> Will they suffer the sove∣reignty of the state to be bound in shackles? God forbid, that they should so far forget themselves their friends, and adherents.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="024407_0632_0FC6F9A83A9D95B0"/>LET us now take a short view of the present si∣tuation of the bank. A learned and enlightened committee of the house of assembly, <HI>after a fair and impartial enquiry,</HI> have found and reported—
<Q>That the bank, as at present established, is in every view incompatible with the public safety</Q>
—and a law founded on this report, hath been du∣ly enacted, taking from that institution the charter which the imprudence of a former assembly had <HI>granted and confirmed to it.</HI> To what purpose then, I again ask, has <HI>Common Sense</HI> taken so much pains? This corporation, so far as it depends for existence on the charter in question, exists no more. This cannot be denied. Does this author expect that our present assembly should work miracles, and raise the dead? He cries out against the ille∣gality of the proceedings that disfranchised the bank; what good can this do? After a criminal has been executed, what purpose can it answer to to discover insufficiencies in the court that convict∣ed him, or irregularities in his trial? Will these discoveries bring the man to life, and give him the chance of a new and fairer trial? Surely not.</P>
<P>A corporation can have but <HI>one</HI> life, viz. a legal or political life; but an individual may have <HI>two</HI> lives, and may exist in one, though deprived of the other—that is, an individual may be alive and in
<PB N="240" REF="024407_0633_0FC6F9A99BB8E0C8"/>
health in <HI>fact,</HI> and at the same time absolutely dead in <HI>law.</HI> An instance of this happened some time since in the county of York. At a court of common pleas there, an ingenious lawyer contrived to have a report brought into court, that the plaintiff, in a certain action then depending, had suddenly died. This report was circulated with such probable circumstances that nobody doubted but that the poor man was dead. The action of course abated by the death of the plaintiff, and it was so entered upon the docket. At the next court the plaintiff appeared in <HI>propria persona,</HI> and complained loud∣ly of the injury that had been done him by this false report: but the ingenious lawyer aforesaid, rose up and assured the court that the man was dead, notwithstanding his impertinent intrusion there: and for the truth of this, he appealed to the entry on the docket; hoping that the court would not allow any testimony to be given in con∣tradiction to a record, which, he observed, is the highest standard of truth known in law.</P>
<P>NOW, although an individual may enjoy a dou∣ble or two-fold life—as is clear from this man's being capable of a double death, for the plaintiff certainly died over again—yet corporations having no real, but only a political existence, can die but once. Well! then, the annulling the charter of
<PB N="241" REF="024407_0634_0FC6F9AC208322A8"/>
the bank, having deprived that institution of its political life, so far at least as it depended there∣upon, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The bank had a charter from Congress, as well as from the state of Pennsylvania</NOTE> it necessarily follows that this bank is de∣funct, demised, deceased, and departed. And there is but one way left, that I know of, in which it can make its appearance amongst us; and that is, by the walking of its discontented ghost.</P>
<P>SOME have thought that the bank may still be considered as politically existing, by virtue of the charter it holds under the Congress of the United States: but as this is a very nice question, and re∣plete with law learning, I shall reserve it for future discussion in a chapter by itself. It only remains now to shew, that the bank has justly deserved the fate it has found, by enumerating some of the ma∣nifold crimes and misdemeanors it has committed, and the horrible dangers and evils to the state with which that institution was pregnant.</P>
<P>I cannot do this better than by following the steps of that enlightened committee, who may be said to have been the jury which passed between the commonwealth and the bank on its life and death, under the sacred sanction of an oath of of∣fice.
<PB N="242" REF="024407_0635_0FC6F9AD5C4C08A8"/>
They have found facts, which, after verdict, ought not to be disputed; that is to say—</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>THE committee, to whom were referred the petitions con∣cerning the bank, established at Philadelphia, and who were in∣structed to enquire, whether the said bank be compatible with the public safety, and that equality which ought ever to prevail between the individuals of a republic, beg leave to report: that it is the opinion of this committee, that the said bank, as at pre∣sent established, is in every view incompatible with the public safe∣ty. That in the present state of our trade, the said bank has a di∣rect tendency to banish a great part of the specie from the coun∣try, so as to produce a scarcity of money, and to collect into the hands ot the stockholders of the said bank, almost the whole of the money which remains amongst us. That, the accumulation of enormous wealth in the hands of a society who claim perpetual duration, will necessarily produce a degree of influence and power which cannot be entrusted in the hands of any set of men, whatsoever, without endangering the public safety. That, the said bank, in its corporate capacity, is empowered to hold estates to the amount of ten millions of dollars; and, by the tenor of the present charter is to exist for ever, without being obliged to yield any emolument to the government, or to be at all dependant upon it. That, the great profits of the bank, which will daily encrease as money grows scarcer, and which already far exceeds the profit of European banks, have tempted foreigners to vest their money in this bank, and thus to draw from us large sums for interest. That foreigners will doubtless be more and more induced to become stock-holders, until the time may arrive, when this enormous engine of power may become subject to fo∣reign influence: this country may be agitated with the politics of European courts, and the good people of America reduced once more into a state of subordination and dependence upon some one or other of the European powers. That, at best, if it were even confined to the hands of Americans, it would be totally destructive of that equality which ought to prevail in a republic. We have nothing in our free and equal government capable of balancing the influence which the bank must create; and we see nothing, which in the course of a few years, can prevent the di∣rectors of the bank from governing Pennsylvania. Already we have felt its influence indirectly interfering in the measures of the legislature. Already the house of assembly, the representa∣tives of the people, have been threatened that the credit of our pa∣per currency will be blasted by the bank. And if this growing evil continues, we fear the time is not very distant when the bank will be able to dictate to the legislature what laws to pass, and what to forbear.</Q></NOTE> THAT the bank, as established, is incompatible with the public safety. That, in the present state of trade, it had a direct tendency to banish specie from the country, and thereby accumulate it in the hands of the stock-holders. That this accu∣mulation of enormous wealth in the hands of
<PB N="243" REF="024407_0636_0FC6F9B3CB75DE50"/>
those very citizens who are instrumental in ba∣nishing wealth from the country, will necessarily produce a degree of influence and power which cannot be trusted in the hands of a set of men, not attached to the party whose interests the commit∣tee wish to promote, without endangering the very existence of that party. That government had not received, nor was likely to receive, any advan∣tage from this institution; because it could only
<PB N="244" REF="024407_0637_0FC6F9B59E0D4C60"/>
<HI>borrow</HI> from the bank for public use, and not <HI>seize</HI> upon the st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck whenever exigence, convenience, or the views of those in power, require it. That, the profits of the bank being in money, must dai∣ly encrease, as money grows scarcer; and has al∣ready so far exceeded the profits of European banks, as to tempt foreigners to encrease this scarcity of money, by vesting large sums in the bank, for which they only draw interest. That, foreigner after foreigner, may be thus tempted by our encreasing scarcity of money, until all the specie of Europe shall be accumulated in the bank; and then princes and states will hold annual meetings for the election of a president and direc∣tors to manage this enormous engine of power: and so our country will be again agitated by Eu∣ropean politics, and the good people of America, by possessing the wealth of foreign nations, will become dependant upon them. That even sup∣posing no interference of foreigners, yet our own citizens being stockholders might in time, by banishing all the specie from the country, become so enormously rich and powerful as to seize on the government of the state, subvert the constitution, and give legislative authority to the president and directors of the bank.</P>
<P>AFTER this black catalogue of offences and
<PB N="245" REF="024407_0638_0FC6F9B719C11BF0"/>
possible evils, who will say that the bank hath not justly merited political death? But besides these pernicious effects, these fears and apprehensions, other evil designs and abominable practices have been suggested against this institution—such as, that Mr. F—, once in every week, rises at mid∣night, and with a dark lanthorn in his hand, enters the vaults of the bank through the subterraneous passage leading from the cellars of his own house into those vaults; that he there meets <HI>Belzebub and Blackbeard the pirate;</HI> and that these three, sitting upon boxes of money, hold consultations, and conspire against the peace and safety of the common∣wealth. That one of the schemes of this infernal triumvirate is to bribe the <HI>Algerines</HI> with the mo∣ney of the bank to seize upon all American vessels, except those in which R— M—, esq. is inter∣ested: and another is to change our republican form of government to a monarchy. In which case R— M— is to be king of Pennsylvania; T— W—, esq. viceroy; Mr. F—, chief justice, and all the clerks of the bank justices of the peace.</P>
<P>BUT as the committee, notwithstanding <HI>the strict enquiry</HI> they have made, have not sound or report∣ed these facts, I am inclined, to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k they may not be true. It would not be amiss, however, that the
<PB N="246" REF="024407_0639_0FC6F9BC731AB3E0"/>
assembly should order Mr. F—'s cellars to be examined, and if the subterraneous passage should be found, it will give probability to the suggestion; and then further enquiries might lead to a disco∣very of the whole plot.</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IN a government professedly <HI>free,</HI> that is a govern∣ment of laws, binding on the whole by the consent of legal representatives of the whole, it seems ne∣cessary that not only the laws themselves, but what is called the practice of the law, should be better understood by the people at large.</P>
<P>IT is in vain for a person not versed in the my∣steries of the profession to look into books of reports for the history of a trial at law. He may as well look for religion in the works of <HI>Jacob Behmen,</HI> or the practice of physic in <HI>Aristotle.</HI> He will find the subject matter concealed in technical jargon, and a cloud of artificial terms, to many of which professors themselves have not yet assign∣ed a determinate meaning.</P>
<P>WHEN a law first issues from the hands of the legislature it is generally sufficiently intelligible. It
<PB N="249" REF="024407_0642_0FC6F9C34DA32A48"/>
is like metal from the smelting furnace. But when it has undergone the operations of a judicial forge, it assumes appearances very different from its first form. For law is the most malleable thing in nature, and what with the heat of contest and the hammers of legal forms, it soon becomes, in judicial construction, no more like the original than a bar of iron is like the pig of metal from which it has been forged.</P>
<P>I think it would be of considerable use, that this process should be delineated at large; that the people may have an opportunity of knowing whe∣ther their own acts are executed according to their spirit and intent, and whether, what is called the common law, is fairly construed and applied in their courts of justice, or not.</P>
<P>I know of no better way to effect this, than by recommending that all trials and law proceedings should be published in detail, with as sparing a use of mere professional language as possible. The case in contest should first be stated in as few and plain words as may be; and then should follow the whole proceedings of the court; the argu∣ments of council; the interferences and opinions of the judges, &amp;c. all in <HI>dramatic</HI> form.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="024407_0643_0FC6F9C4CCDD26E0"/>TO elucidate my scheme, I will attempt the re∣port of a case in the manner I think it ought to be done.</P>
<P>IT is scarcely necessary to premise that the case I shall state, the <HI>dramatis personae,</HI> and other cir∣cumstances, are altogether fictitious, and designed only as a mode for learned reporters in time to come.</P>

<HEAD>SPECIMEN OF A MODERN LAW-SUIT. THE CASE STATED.</HEAD>
<P><HI>LAWRENCE LANDLORD</HI> was seized in fee of 300 acres of land: that is, it was his own estate. He leased 100 acres thereof, together with a farm-house, barn, orchard, &amp;c. to his neighbour <HI>Timothy Tenant,</HI> for a term of years, reserving a certain rent, and covenanting for seve∣ral specific articles and privileges: amongst these was the following.</P>
<P><Q>AND it is hereby further agreed by and between the said parties, that the said <HI>Timothy Tenant</HI> shall at all times, during the term of this present lease, preserve, keep, and set apart for the use, benefit, and behoof, of the said <HI>Lawrence Landlord,</HI> the <HI>apple-skins or parings of all the apples used in the said Timothy
<PB N="252" REF="024407_0645_0FC6F9CCF4D8FDE0"/>
Tenant's family; to the intent and purpose that the said Lawrence Landlord may therewith feed, fatten, and raise up his pig or pigs</HI>: Provided always, that the said <HI>Lawrence Landlord,</HI> by himself or his servants, and at his own expence, cost and trouble, shall send for, fetch, carry, or cause to be carried, away the apple-skins or par∣ings aforesaid, for the purposes aforesaid.</Q></P>
<P>AND so it was, that under a construction of this clause, and by advice of council learned in the law, <HI>Lawrence Landlord</HI> had sent for and taken away the APPLES growing in the orchard of <HI>Ti∣mothy Tenant.</HI> Whereupon the said <HI>Timothy</HI>
brought his action of trespass, and sued for damages for the wrong and injury done.</P>
<P>THIS cause had been instituted in the common-pleas, and gone through the ceremonials of many terms. At length, all objections being obviated, and all causes of delay removed, the defendant finding that the trial must certainly come on, re∣moved the cause, by <HI>habeas corpus,</HI> to a superior court. After again waiting all reasonable and un∣reasonable adjournments, objections and delays, the argument came on in the superior court, on Thursday the <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> day of <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> A.

<P>May it please your honours! and you, gentlemen of the jury!—In this cause I am coun∣cil for the plaintiff. It is an action of trespass, and the cause of action is set forth in the declaration,
<PB N="255" REF="024407_0648_0FC6F9DC71E03FE0"/>
which states; that on the 10th day of October, in the year 1783, Lawrence Landlord, the defen∣dant, did with his servants and accomplices, enter the demesne of the plaintiff, and with force and arms, and so forth, then and there did take and car∣ry away one bushel of apples, the property of the plaintiff, and of the growth and produce of a cer∣tain orchard, which then was, and still is, in the rightful tenure, possession, and occupancy, of the plaintiff; by virtue of a certain lease or contract, the term of which was not then, nor is yet, ex∣pired.</P>
<P>IF the court pleases, I shall proceed to establish the facts, by exhibiting a copy or counterpart of the lease, and producing witnesses to prove the wrong and injury done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Court.</HI> Z.</SPEAKER>
<P>May it please your honours! we will save the gentleman the trouble, and the court their time and attention, by demurring to the tes∣timony offered. We admit the facts, and shall rest our defence upon the legal construction of the clause in the lease, which reserves to Lawrence Landlord all the <HI>apple-skins</HI> or <HI>parings,</HI> and so forth; and shall shew most clearly, that both by the intendment of the parties, and the very words of the contract, all apples growing on the premises were reserved to the use of the lessor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="256" REF="024407_0649_0FC6F9DE794B5FA8"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Coun.</HI> X.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here then, if the court pleases, we join issue. It is not pretended that we have in any instance violated the terms of our lease, or incurred any forfeiture. The clause in contest: is in these words:
<Q>And it is hereby further agreed by and between the said parties, that the said Timothy Tenant shall at all times, during the term of this present lease, preserve, keep, and set apart, for the use, benefit and behoof the said Lawrence Landlord, the apple-skins, or parings, of all the apples used in his, the said Timothy Tenant's family, to the intent and purpose, that the said Lawrence Landlord may therewith feed, fatten, and raise up his pig or pigs. Provided always,</Q>
and so forth.</P>
<P>NOW, it lies with the defendant to shew that there is no difference between the apple skins or parings, and the <HI>apples</HI> themselves.</P>
<P>THE facts being admitted, no further opening of the cause is necessary. The court and jury will perceive the point on which it turns, viz. the con∣struction and legal operation of the clause just read. I shall wait for the arguments and authorities that may be produced on the other side, only observ∣ing for the present, that the injury we have sustain∣ed hath been very grievous; the peace of our fa∣mily
<PB N="257" REF="024407_0650_0FC6F9E27079C270"/>
has been disturbed by strangers entering with a usurped authority, and snatching, as it were, the victuals from our mouth, and from the mouths of our children. And further, that if this right should be established in the lessor, we shall have lost not only the dumplins of that day, but all fu∣ture dumplins, apple-pies and apple-puddings, du∣the term of our lease.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Coun.</HI> Z.</SPEAKER>
<P>May it please your honours! and you, gentlemen of the jury! In this cause wherein Ti∣mothy Tenant is plaintiff, and Lawrence Landlord defendant; I am council for the defendant. As there is no dispute about the facts, much time will be spared, and the argument brought within a nar∣row compass.</P>
<P>WE are charged, gentlemen of the jury, with having, with force and arms, and so forth, taken certain apples from an orchard in the tenure of the plaintiff. Setting aside the literal meaning of those formidable words—<HI>with force and arms,</HI> which in this <HI>pul-lace,</HI> are mere forms of law, and there∣fore have no meaning at all. I say, setting aside these formidable words, we acknowledge and con∣fess that we took certain apples from an orchard in the tenure of Timothy Tenant the plaintiff; and we contend, and we hope we shall be able to de∣monstrate
<PB N="258" REF="024407_0651_0FC6F9E366320BB0"/>
to this honourable court, by arguments most <HI>cul-lear</HI> and <HI>pul-lain,</HI> drawn from the <HI>pe-urest</HI>
fountains of law, and supported by most respectable authorities, that we have committed no wrong whatever; no <HI>bur-reach</HI> of our contract; and that Timothy Tenant hath no rightful cause of <HI>compul-laint</HI>
against us. And why? Because we say, when we assigned this estate to the lessee, we <HI>expur-ressly</HI>
reserved the <HI>fur-ruit</HI> of this orchard to our own use, or rather to the use of our pig or pigs. And how will this appear? most <HI>cul-learly</HI> by attending to the clause in the lease, which is the object of our <HI>pur-resent</HI> discussion.</P>
<P>THIS <HI>cul-lause,</HI> gentlemen of the jury, is in these words: "And it hereby further agreed by and between the said parties," &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>NOW, may it please the court, here is a full and <HI>com-pul-lete</HI> agreement, covenant or contract, be∣tween the lessor and lessee.</P>
<P>AN <HI>agur-reement,</HI> gentlemen of the jury, is de∣fined in law, <HI>agregatio mentium de re aliqua facta vel facienda:</HI> that is, a concurrence of will in the parties, respecting something done or to be done; and a contract or covenant is an <HI>agur-reement</HI> sub∣stantiated and solemnized in full form of law.
<PB N="259" REF="024407_0652_0FC6F9E52D1C2050"/>
Further, may it please the court, obligation ari∣sing from contracts are divided and distinguished, <HI>ex re,</HI> from a thing done; <HI>ex verbis,</HI> from words; <HI>ex literis,</HI> from writing; and <HI>ex consensu,</HI> from consent.</P>
<P>NOW I shall <HI>pur-rove</HI> to the satisfaction of the court and jury, that the present contract is full and <HI>com-pul-lete</HI> in all these essential circumstances; that is to say; <HI>ex re, ex verbis, ex literis,</HI> and <HI>ex-consensu.</HI> And, if so, we apprehend it must fol∣low as <HI>cul-learly</HI> as a <HI>pur-roblem</HI> in Euclid, that the lessor had a right to take the <HI>apples</HI> of the les∣see, and give them to his pigs. May it please the court, the <HI>res, rem,</HI> or <HI>re,</HI> in this contract, is the right reserved by the lessor to enter the <HI>pur-remises</HI>
of the lessee, and take away all the apple-skins or parings of apples, and so forth; the very words of the lease. Now, if the court pleases, how is this <HI>res, rem,</HI> or <HI>re,</HI> confirmed and established? Why, <HI>ex verbis</HI> from the words of the clause, and <HI>ex literis</HI> from the letters which compose those words; and the <HI>ex consensu</HI> is <HI>cul-lear</HI> beyond the possibility of a doubt, by the seals and signatures of the parties, solemnly executed in the <HI>pur-resence</HI>
of several subscribing witnesses.</P>
<P>I now come, if the court pleases, to prove by
<PB N="260" REF="024407_0653_0FC6F9F0415B1390"/>
solid argument, supported by a <HI>cul-loud</HI> of autho∣rities most respectable in law, that by the word ap∣ple-skins and parings, <HI>the apples</HI> themselves will pass by <HI>con-stur-ruction</HI> of law and right reason.</P>
<P>NOW, if your honours please, it is most <HI>pul-lain</HI>
and manifest, that the apple skin cannot possi∣bly be transferred, given or taken away, without the apple itself passing therewith. And why? For this <HI>pul-lain,</HI> and <HI>cul-lear</HI> reason, because, if the apple-skin or paring be severed or separated from the apple, it is no longer an <HI>apple-skin,</HI> but be∣comes, in its severed state, only the <HI>skin of an ap∣ple;</HI>
and so saith the law. Coke's Reports, Part II<SUP>nd</SUP> page 225, <Q>Severance of corn, is the cutting and carrying it off from the ground; and some∣times, the setting out the tithe from the rest of the corn, is called <HI>severance:</HI></Q>
most <HI>cul-learly</HI>
then, the cutting the skin from the apple, is a <HI>se∣verance;</HI>
and such a severance as the law notices and recognizes. Gentlemen of the jury! I hope I am understood; this is a very important point. I say, there is a material difference between an apple skin and the skin of an apple. And, why? Because a reservation of the apple-skin is, by <HI>constur-ruction</HI> of law, a reservation of the apple itself. And, why? For this <HI>pul-lain</HI> and manifest reason; because, when the outward bounds, lines,
<PB N="261" REF="024407_0654_0FC6F9F1A7840EF0"/>
or limits; or, as the law expresses it, the <HI>pars continens</HI> of any matter or thing is <HI>discur-riptively</HI>
conveyed, assigned, or reserved, the internal parts of that matter or thing must also be con∣veyed, assigned, or reserved, otherwise there would be an absolute <HI>severance,</HI> which the law abhors; for, it is an adjudged case, that te∣nants in common of a horse cannot severe their property.</P>
<P>BUT, may it please your honours! I hasten to produce authorities directly in point: and first, if the court pleases, I will take up O'Farrell's Re∣ports, page 106.</P>

<HEAD><HI>MISTAKE</HI> versus <HI>BLUNDER.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS was an action on the statute of <HI>Pa∣trick</HI> 4<SUP>th</SUP> chap. 16. called <HI>the statute of nails,</HI> which prohibits all subjects within the realm from cutting or paring their nails on a <HI>Friday:</HI>
under the penalty of twenty shillings for every offence, to be recovered by the overseers of the poor, for the use of the poor of the county in which the offence should be committed. <HI>Mis∣take</HI>
and others were overseers of the poor for the county of <HI>Antrim,</HI> and brought their action under the statute against the defendant. And it was in proof that the defendant had pared his thumb nails and his great toe nails on <HI>Friday,</HI>
<PB N="262" REF="024407_0655_0FC6F9F3271ABA18"/>
to wit: on Friday, the— day of —, at twelve o'clock in the night of the same day.</P>
<P>COUNCIL for the defendant demurred to the facts; observing, that as this was a penal law, it ought to be strictly construed. And there∣upon, took three points of defence, viz. <HI>First,</HI> it was urged, that <HI>night</HI> is not <HI>day,</HI> and the sta∣tute expressly says <HI>Fri-day</HI> and not <HI>Fri-night;</HI>
and the proof is, that the cutting was at night. <HI>Secondly,</HI> it was contended, that twelve o'clock on Friday night is in fact the beginning of Sa∣turday morning, and therefore not within the statute. And, <HI>thirdly,</HI> that the words of the sta∣tute are UNGUES DIGITORUM—Anglici—<HI>the nails of the</HI> FINGERS, and the testimony only res∣pects <HI>thumbs and great toes.</HI></P>
<P>THE jury gave in a special verdict: whereup∣on, after long advisement, the judges were una∣nimously of opinion, on the first point, that in construction of law, day is night and night is day; because a day consists of 24 hours, and the law will not allow of fractions of a day <HI>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> minimi non curat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lex</HI>—in English, the law don't stand upon trifles. On <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he second point, that 12 o'clock at night, being the precise line of di∣vision between Friday night and Saturday morn∣ing,
<PB N="263" REF="024407_0656_0FC6F9F49D22B5B0"/>
is a portion or point of time which may be considered as belonging to both, or to either, or to neither, at the discretion of the court. And, <HI>thirdly,</HI> that in construction of law, fingers are thumbs and thumbs are fingers, and thumbs and fingers are great toes and little toes, and great toes and little toes are thumbs and fingers; and so judgment for the plaintiff.</P>

<P>NOW, may it please the court, from this autho∣rity it is <HI>most cul-lear,</HI> that apple-skins are ap∣ples, and that apples are apple-skins. I am confi∣dent in saying that the smallest particle of doubt cannot remain in the <HI>unpur-rejudiced</HI> mind. But to make the matter still more <HI>cul-lear and pul-lain,</HI> as if it were possible to demonstrate <HI>demonstur∣ration,</HI> here is an act of assembly—an act of our own government, which brings the matter home to the very door of the <HI>pur-resent</HI> case. Acts of assembly, printed volume, page 314. This, if the court pleases, is an act for laying an excise on cyder, and the words are "all apples or apple-skins."—Now the article <HI>or</HI> is in this place neither conjunctive nor disjunctive, but <HI>pe-urly</HI>
explanatory: as if the law had said, all apples— or, which is the same thing, all apple-skins.</P>
<P>HERE, Gentlemen of the jury, the legislature hath declared itself on the very point before the
<PB N="264" REF="024407_0657_0FC6F9FFDDEECBC8"/>
court. And it is <HI>cul-lear</HI> as the sun at noon day when not a <HI>cul-loud</HI> is to be seen in the sky, that apple-skins or parings and the apples themselves are, in <HI>constur-ruction</HI> of law, one and the same thing. And it follows, as undeniably as a <HI>pur-obl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m</HI>
in Euclid, that when the present lessor reserved the apple-skins or parings, he, at one and the same time, reserved the apples also for his use, or ra∣ther, as the contract <HI>expur-resses</HI> it, for the use of his pig or pigs.</P>
<P>FOR what would be the consequence, may it please the court—what would be the consequence of any other construction? If the lessee should eat the apples himself, would this fatten the lessor's pigs? Surely not—Would the dumplins and ap∣ple-pyes of the <HI>pul-laintiff's</HI> children fatten the de∣fendant's pigs? Surely not—Would the cyder made by Timothy Tenant raise up the pigs of Law∣rence Landlord? Surely not—Does the clause in the lease say that the tenant shall have all the apples, and leave only the skins of apples for the landlord? It says no such thing.</P>
<P>WITH the leave of the court, I will put a case—Suppose a miller hath a sack of meal: I ask him what he will take for that sack, and we agree
<PB N="265" REF="024407_0658_0FC6FA0110AD97A0"/>
for twenty shillings. After the agreement, and after I have paid the stipulated price, the <HI>cur-rafty</HI>
miller may as well empty out the meal and give me the void sack for my money, as that the <HI>pul-laintiff,</HI> in the <HI>pur-resent</HI> cause, should be en∣titled by this honourable court to eat the apples himself, and give only the skins of apples to the de∣fendant.</P>
<P>GENTLMEN of the jury! this is a cause of <HI>gur-reat</HI>
magnitude, no less than determining by solemn adjudication the distinction between an apple-skin and the skin of an apple. But I have the fullest confidence that this enlightened court and jury, will see as <HI>cul-lear</HI> as the sun when not a single <HI>cul-loud</HI> intervenes, that the skin of an apple is or may be the skin of any apple; but an apple-skin is the skin of a known and determinate apple; an∣nexed to and circumscribing that apple; being in truth the <HI>pars continens</HI> thereof. As if one should take an apple in his hand, and say—<HI>this,</HI> pointing to the part, (having cut the apple in half) is the apple seed—<HI>this,</HI> (still pointing to the res∣pective parts,) is the apple-core—<HI>this,</HI> is the ap∣ple pulp—and <HI>this,</HI> (still pointing,) is the apple skin—the <HI>pars continens</HI> of the whole; and so, altogether, viz, seed, core, pulp and skin, make
<PB N="266" REF="024407_0659_0FC6FA022D4B3ED0"/>
up a full and <HI>com-pul-lete</HI> apple—or, as the law would express it, an apple-skin <HI>pars pro toto</HI>—for the law delighteth in brevity.</P>
<P>MAY it please the court, I come now, in as few words as possible, to answer an argument which may be brought on the other side, founded on these words in the clause under consideration: <Q>Of all the apples <HI>used</HI> in his the said Timothy Tenant's family.</Q>
And here, most <HI>pur-robably,</HI> the gen∣tleman of council for the <HI>pul-laintiff,</HI> will observe with his usual ingenuity, that these words strongly indicate a severance to be intended. Otherwise, as he will say, how shall the apples be used in the family of the lessee, if, under the term <HI>apple-skins,</HI> the whole, that is, both skins and apples are re∣served to the lessor?</P>
<P>SUCH an argument might have weight with a less enlightened jury than that I have the honour now to address. But let us <HI>bur-ring</HI> this seeming reason to the test of law, that unerring rule of right, that apex, summit, and perfection of human reason, and we shall soon see the mist of error va∣nish, and the <HI>cul-lear</HI> sun of truth <HI>bur-reak</HI> forth with unrivalled <HI>ur-radiance.</HI></P>
<P>THE words are:
<Q>of all the apples <HI>used</HI> in his
<PB N="267" REF="024407_0660_0FC6FA03B8691DC8"/>
(the <HI>pul-laintiff's</HI>) family.</Q>
We will now con∣sider, if the court pleases, the doctrine of USES, as laid down in the books. And here it is to be ob∣served, that the <HI>habendum</HI> of every deed consists of two limitations; the one of estate or property which the feoffee, or party possessive, shall receive by the deed; and the other the limitation of the <HI>use</HI> or <HI>uses</HI>: that is, for whose use he shall hold the property: by which means the possession is in one man, and the use or <HI>pur-rofit</HI> in another. And for this, I turn to <HI>Gilbert's</HI> law of uses, page 175.
<Q>An use, at common law, was an equitable right which he reserved, who conveyed a legal estate to another; upon trust and confidence, that the person to whom he so conveyed it, would ne∣vertheless suffer him to take the rents and profits of the land.</Q></P>
<P>HERE then it is <HI>pul-lain</HI> to demonstration, that the lessor, the defendant in the <HI>pur-resent</HI> cause, hath reserved the <HI>pur-rofits</HI> or <HI>fur-ruits</HI> of the land although he has leased the soil itself to the <HI>pul-laintiff.</HI> And how has he done this? Not by re∣serving the apples <HI>gur-rowing</HI> on the premises. This would have been equivocal and uncertain, as the vulgar tongue for the most part is. And why? Because it is not certain and determinate what an
<PB N="268" REF="024407_0661_0FC6FA0CC84B5250"/>
apple is—There are <HI>fur-ruits,</HI> which in common parlance are called <HI>oak-apples;</HI> others <HI>balsam ap∣ples;</HI> others <HI>crab-apples,</HI> and so forth: and even potatoes are denominated <HI>les pommes de terre;</HI> that is, <HI>earth apples;</HI> or, as some translate it, <HI>the apples of the earth.</HI> How, I say, has the lessor made his reservation? Not by reserving the skins of apples; for then <HI>cestuy que use,</HI> the lessor's pigs would have nothing but the offals, the excrementitious parts of the <HI>fur-ruit</HI> to fatten on. But he has, with <HI>tur-rue</HI> legal precision, reserved the apple-skins which include the apples themselves; as the metes and boundaries of a tract of land <HI>incul-lude</HI> and convey the land itself, with all its buildings, <HI>im∣pur-rovements</HI> and appurtenances. And why? Because by a maxim of law, <HI>cujus est solum ejus est usque ad coelum.</HI></P>
<P>BUT to return to the doctrine of uses—<HI>Gilbert's</HI> law of uses page 26:
<Q>Though at common law <HI>cestuy que use</HI> had no power over the land, yet he might alien the use; because every one might dispose of the rights that are in him.</Q></P>
<P>HERE then, if your honours please! we see, that the lessor, the <HI>pur-resent</HI> defendant, hath a power, not only to use the apples himself, but
<PB N="269" REF="024407_0662_0FC6FA10671975E0"/>
might, if he so thought fit, sell or dispose of them to another. <HI>A fortiori</HI> shall he give them to his own pigs. And why? Because, saith this <HI>bur-right</HI> luminary of law, <HI>Baron Gilbert,</HI>
<Q>Every man may dispose of the right that is in him</Q></P>
<P>MAY it please the court, I could go on, op<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> up, and display the whole doctrine of trusts and uses, as laid down in the books; and, at every step, it would appear <HI>cul-lear, cul-learer,</HI> and still more <HI>cul-lear,</HI> that the words of the contract, "used in his family," are, by intendment of law, to be considered as meaning no more than a naked possession in trust for <HI>cestuy que use</HI> the defendant's pigs.</P>
<P>BUT I shall not take up the time of this honour∣able court, by heaping proof upon proof, or in attempts to elucidate the <HI>ur-radiance</HI> of the sun.</P>
<P>I confidently submit the defendant's cause to the court and jury: having, as I hope, quench∣ed every scintilla of doubt in the <HI>unpur-rejudiced</HI> mind.</P>

authorities to be genuine. I did not choose to interrupt him at the time; but he may obviate the objection now if he can; the authority I allude to was cited from the printed volume of our acts of assembly, page 314. in these words, "all apple skins or apples." Now, I say that this is a false and erroneous publication of the law, and of no authority. I have here, if the court pleases, a certified copy of this law taken from the original record in the roll's office.

As to your oath of office; this is also nothing more than a law-form, and like other law forms, hath, or may have, a very different import from what the same words would have in common acceptation; the true intent and meaning of this oath has been ex∣plained to you by the chief justice, in his excel∣lent charge, previous to your entering on the du∣ties of your office. You were then told, that when this oath enjoins you diligently to enquire, and true presentment make, it means nothing more, in the law language, than that you are to consider, from the testimony furnished by the court, whe∣ther there may not be probable cause of suspicion, that the accused party is guilty of the crime laid to his charge; and this ought to have satisfied you; for as I before observed, <HI>a grand jury is only a legal machine, manageable at the discretion of the court.</HI></P>

<Q>IN this cause, wherein Timothy Tenant is plain∣tiff, and Lawrence Landlord defendant; if, in construction of law, a reservation of <HI>apple-skins</HI>
and <HI>parings of apples</HI> is a reservation of the whole fruit or the apples themselves, then we find for the defendant; but if apple-skins are, in con∣struction of law, nothing more than apple-skins, then we find for the plaintiff—ten pounds da∣mages, with costs of suit.</Q></P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch. Jus.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are now ready to give judgment on the special verdict in the cause, <HI>Timothy Tenant</HI>
against <HI>Lawrence Landlord.</HI></P>
<P>THE legal construction and operation of a clause of reservation in a lease granted by the defendant to the plaintiff, is the sole point on which the de∣termination of this cause must depend. The re∣serve made, is,
<Q>of the apple-skins or parings of all the apples used in his, the said Timothy Te∣nant's, family; to the intent and purpose, that the said Lawrence Landlord may therewith feed, fatten, and raise up his pig or pigs.</Q></P>
<P>THE distinction between an apple-skin and the skin of an apple was well supported by the coun∣cil for the defendant. And the case cited from <HI>O'Farrel's</HI> reports closely applied. This case of <HI>Mistake versus Blunder</HI> gave rise to many learned comments on the <HI>statute of nails.</HI> Amongst these a very scarce tract hath fallen into my hands, written by the greatest lawyer of his day. He is large on all the points taken in that cause: and on the second, he says, that twelve o'clock on Friday night may be considered as one o'clock on Satur∣day morning, or as eleven o'clock on Friday night,
<PB N="278" REF="024407_0671_0FC6FA32DFCAE698"/>
at the discretion of the court: because, in all cases where a statute fixes a precise and determinate time, one hour each way is supposed to be allowed to the judges, in their decisions thereupon, <HI>to make up for the variations of clocks and watches.</HI></P>
<P>BUT to the point. This lease or contract, is a deed; and deeds are to be considered with respect to their <HI>form</HI> and <HI>substance:</HI> as to the first, it is not contended but that this deed is regular in point of <HI>form.</HI> Let us then consider the <HI>substance.</HI> The substance of any deed is the intention of the par∣ties, at the time of executing it. For all the so∣lemnities which the law requires have no other end or tendency but that of substantiating and fixing, in the most lasting and unequivocal terms, the will and intention of the contractors. We will now bring the clause in question to the test of this rule. The words are,
<Q>All apple-skins and par∣ings,</Q>
and so forth; "To the intent," and so forth, "That the lessor should <HI>fatten and raise up his pigs.</HI>" Now it signifies nothing what we are to understand by apple-skins or parings; what is the essence? What is the substantial part? What <HI>ought to have been</HI> the will of the parties in this contract? Certainly the raising and fattening of pigs was, or ought to have been, the principal object. And, for this reason, because the law looks, with a
<PB REF="024407_0672_0FC6FA3C31DB9490"/>
<PB N="279" REF="024407_0673_0FC6FA3E2E13BEF0"/>
friendly eye on the raising of hogs, and making of pork and bacon, for these are amongst the staple commodities of our country. And we find many acts of assembly for the encouragement of the breed of hogs. Such as the act making it penal for any one to alter the mark of a marked, or <HI>un∣marked,</HI> hog; and the act laying a duty on all roasted pigs under the age of six months, and en∣joing them to be <HI>killed sparingly</HI>—and also one other remarkable act, lately passed, for making hogs, pigs, and swine free of the city, and grant∣ing them unmolested egress and regress through our streets, lanes, and alleys. Under this act, a hog may have his <HI>quare impedit</HI> against any street commissioner or citizen who shall obstruct his pas∣sage, or molest him in the exercise of his right; yet it hath been holden, that a hog may not, by virtue of this act, enter the houses, parlours, or chambers of the citizens.</P>
<P>THUS we see that the law hath a special respect to the raising and fattening of hogs. And what the law intends to be done, it also intends to be well done, or in the best and most effectual manner. Now, how shall the lessor's pigs be best raised up and fattened? Not by being fed with husks, skins or parings; but by eating of the fruit itself, which contains most of the saccharine or nutritious juices of the tree.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="024407_0674_0FC6FA41621E7770"/>ON these clear principles, the court adjudges in favour of the defendant, with costs; and so let it be entered.</P>

<P>I am sorry to find myself under the necessity of dissenting from my brethren.

<P>☞ IN December 1778 the convention of Pennsylvania assem∣bled to consider the constitution or frame of government for the United States, drawn up by the late general convention of the states, and by them recommended to the consideration of the people at large. After three weeks deliberation, the proposed constitution was adopted by the convention of Pennsylvania, by a majority of two thirds of that body. The following allegory contains in substance the principal arguments used in that important debate.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="allegory">
<HEAD>THE NEW ROOF.</HEAD>
<P>THE roof a certain Mansion-house was observ∣ed to be in a very bad condition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The old Confederation.</NOTE>, and quite in∣sufficient for the purpose of protection from the in∣clemencies of the weather. This was matter of surprise and speculation, as it was well known that the roof was not more than twelve years old, and therefore its defects could not be ascribed to a na∣tural decay by time.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH there were many different opinions respecting the causes of this deficiency, yet all agreed that the family could not sleep in comfort or safety under it.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="024407_0677_0FC6FA4ADC71C0E8"/>AT last it was determined to employ some skilful architects to survey and examine this defective roof, to make report of its condition, and to point out such alterations and repairs as might be found necessary.</P>
<P>THESE skilful architects accordingly met toge∣ther; and after a thorough examination of the faulty roof, they found,</P>
<P N="1">1<SUP>st</SUP> That the whole fabric was too weak.</P>
<P N="2">2<SUP>nd</SUP> That there were indeed <HI>thirteen</HI> rafters; but that these rafters were not connected by any braces or ties, so as to form a union of strength.</P>
<P N="3">3<SUP>d</SUP> That some of these rafters were thick and heavy, and others too slight; and as the whole had been put together whilst the timber was yet green, some had warped outwards, and of course sustain∣ed an undue proportion of weight, whilst others, warping inwards, had shrunk from bearing any weight at all.</P>
<P N="4">4<SUP>th</SUP> THAT the shingling and lathing had not been secured with iron nails, but only wooden pegs<NOTE PLACE="foot">Paper Currency.</NOTE>, which swelling and shrinking by successions of wet
<PB N="284" REF="024407_0678_0FC6FA51422360E8"/>
and dry weather, had left the shingles so loose, that many of them had been blown away by the wind; and that before long, the whole would, probably, in like manner be blown away.</P>
<P N="5">5<SUP>th</SUP> THAT the cornice was so ill proportioned, and so badly put up, as to be neither an ornament nor of use: and,</P>
<P N="6">6<SUP>th</SUP> That the roof was so flat as to admit the most idle servants in the family, their playmates and acquaintance, to trample upon and abuse it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Want of dignity in government.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HAVING made these observations, these judici∣ous architects were of opinion, that it would be altogether vain and fruitless to attempt any altera∣tions or repairs in a roof so defective in all points, and therefore proposed to have it entirely remov∣ed; and that a new roof, of a better construction, should be erected over the mansion-house: and they also prepared a drawing or plan of a new roof, such as they thought most excellent for se∣curity, duration, and ornament. In forming this plan, they consulted the most celebrated authors in ancient and modern architecture, and brought into their design the most approved parts, selected from the models before them; and finally endeavoured
<PB N="285" REF="024407_0679_0FC6FA540E4CB4A0"/>
to proportion the whole to the size of the building, and the strength of the walls.</P>
<P>THIS proposal of a new roof, it may well be imagined, became the principal subject of conver∣sation in the family: and the opinions of it were various, according to the judgment, interests, or ignorance of the disputants.</P>
<P>ON a certain day the servants of the family had assembled in the great hall to discuss the important question. Amongst these was JAMES,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">J— W—, esq.</NOTE> the archi∣tect, who had been one of the surveyors of the old roof, and had a principal hand in forming the plan of the new one. A great number of tenants had also gathered out of doors, and crowded the win∣dows and avenues to the hall, which were left open for them, that they might hear the arguments for and against the new roof.</P>
<P>NOW, there was an old woman, known by the name of <HI>Margery the midwife,</HI> who had got a comfortable apartment in the mansion-house. This woman was of an intriguing spirit, of a restless and inveterate temper, fond of tattle, and a great mis∣chief-maker. In this situation, and with these ta∣lents,
<PB N="286" REF="024407_0680_0FC6FA561E0F7AF8"/>
she unavoidably acquired an influence in the family; by the exercise of which, according to her natural propensity, she had long kept the house in confusion, and sown discord and discontent amongst the servants.</P>
<P><HI>MARGERY</HI> was, for many reasons, an irrecon∣cilable enemy to the new roof, and the artichects who had contrived it. Amongst these, two rea∣sons were very obvious. First: the mantle-piece, on which her cups and platters were placed, was made of a portion of the great cornice; and she boiled her pot with the shingles that blew off from the defective roof: and, secondly, it so happened that, in the construction of the new roof, her apart∣ment would be considerably lessened.</P>
<P>NO sooner, therefore, did she hear of the plan proposed by the architects, but she put on her old red cloak, and was day and night trudging amongst the servants and tenants, crying out against the new roof, and the framers thereof. Amongst these she had selected <HI>William, Jack,</HI> and <HI>Robert,</HI> three of the servants, and instigated them to oppose the plan recommended. She caused them to be sent to the great hall on the day of debate, and furnish∣ed
<PB N="287" REF="024407_0681_0FC6FA579BFBC1E0"/>
them with innumerable alarms and fears, cun∣ning arguments, and specious objections.</P>
<P>NOW, the principal argument and objections with which <HI>Margery</HI> had instructed William, Jack, and Robert, were these.</P>
<P N="1">1<SUP>st</SUP> THAT the architects had not exhibited a bill of scantling <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bill of rights.</NOTE> for the new roof, as they ought to have done; and, therefore, the carpenters, under the pretence of providing timber for it, might lay waste whole forests, to the ruin of the farm.</P>
<P N="2">2<SUP>dly</SUP> THAT no provision was made in the plan for a trap door <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Liberty of the press.</NOTE> for the servants to pass through with water, if the chimney should take fire, and that in case of such an accident it might hereafter be deemed penal to break a hole in the roof, for access, to save the whole building from destruction.</P>
<P N="3">3<SUP>dly</SUP> THAT this roof was to be guarded by battlements<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Standing army.</NOTE>, which in stormy seasons, would prove dangerous to the family, as the bricks might be blown down and fall on their heads.</P>
<P N="4">4<SUP>thly</SUP> IT was observed, that the old roof was or∣namented
<PB N="288" REF="024407_0682_0FC6FA63126A8210"/>
with twelve pedestals, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Trial by jury.</NOTE> ranged along the ridge, which had been objects of universal ad∣miration. Whereas, according to the new plan, these pedestals were only to be placed along the eaves of the roof over the walls. As to the cu∣pola, some of the objectors said it was too heavy, and would prove a dangerous burden to the build∣ing; whilst others insisted that it was too light, and would certainly be blown away by the wind</P>
<P N="5">5<SUP>thly</SUP> IT was urged, that the thirteen rafters would be so strongly braced together, that the individual and separate strength of each rafter would be lost in the compounded and united strength of the whole <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">That the sovereignties of the several states would be absorbed in the general government.</NOTE> and so this roof might be considered as one solid mass of timber, and not as composed of distinct rafters like the old roof.</P>
<P N="6">6<SUP>thly</SUP> THAT, according to the proposed plan, the several parts of the roof were so framed as to mutually strengthen and support each other; and therefore, there was great reason to fear, that the whole might stand independent of the walls;
<PB N="305" REF="024407_0683_0FC6FA64698C7980"/>
and, that in time the walls might moulder away, and the roof remain suspended in the air, threaten∣ing destruction to all who should come under it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That it would be a consolidated government, and might exist independent of the people or of the states.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>TO these objections, JAMES, the architect, in substance replied.</P>
<P N="1">1<SUP>st</SUP> AS to the want of a bill of scantling, he ob∣served, that if the timber for this roof was to be purchased from a stranger, it would have been quite proper to have such a bill, lest the stranger should charge in account more than he was en∣titled to; but as the timber was to be cut from our own lands, a bill of scantling was both useless and improper. It was of no use, because the wood always was, and always would be, the pro∣perty of the family, whether growing in the fo∣rest, or fabricated into a roof for the mansion-house; and improper, because the carpenters would be bound by the bill of scantling; which, if it should not be perfectly accurate, a circum∣stance not to be expected, either the roof would be defective for want of sufficient materials, or the carpenters must cut from the forest, without au∣thority, which is penal by the laws of the house.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="306" REF="024407_0684_0FC6FA660F626E48"/>2<SUP>dly</SUP> TO the second objection, he said, that a trap-door was not properly a part in the frame of a roof; but there could be no doubt but that the carpenters would take care to make such a door in the shingling for the family to carry water through, <HI>dirty</HI> or <HI>clean,</HI> to extinguish fire, either in the chimney or on the roof; and that this was the only proper way of making such a door.</P>
<P N="3">3<SUP>dly</SUP> AS to the battlements, he insisted, that they were absolutely necessary for the protection of the whole house. 1<SUP>st</SUP> Because, in case of a sudden attack by robbers, the family could defend themselves behind these battlements, and annoy and disperse the enemy. 2<SUP>dly</SUP> If any of the ad∣joining buildings should take fire, the battlements would screen the roof from the destructive flames. And, 3<SUP>dly</SUP>, they would retain the rafters in their respective places, in case any of them should, from rottenness or warping, be in danger of fall∣ing from the general union, and injuring the other parts of the roof: observing also, that the battle∣ments should always be ready for these purposes, as there would be neither time nor opportunity for raising battlements after an assault was actually made, or a conflagration begun. As to the bricks being blown down, and falling on the heads of the people, he said the whole would always be in
<PB N="307" REF="024407_0685_0FC6FA6E54069E10"/>
the power of the family, who could at any time repair or remove any loose and dangerous parts; and there could be no doubt but that their vigi∣lance would be fully sufficient to prevent accidents of this kind.</P>
<P N="4">4<SUP>thly</SUP> WITH respect to the twelve pedestals, he acknowledged their use and beauty; but observed that these, like all other things, were only so in their proper places, and under circumstances suit∣ed to their nature and design: and he insisted that the ridge of a roof was not the place for pede∣stals, which should rest on the solid wall, being made of the same materials; and ought, in propri∣ety, to be considered as so many projections, or continuations of the wall itself, and not as compo∣nent parts of the wooden roof. As to the cupola, he said, that all agreed that there should be one of some kind or other; as well for a proper finish to the building, as for the purpose of indicating the winds, and containing a bell to sound the alarm in cases of necessity. The objections to the proposed cupola, he said, were too contradictory to merit a reply.</P>
<P N="5">5<SUP>thly</SUP> TO the fifth objection, he answered: that the intention really was to make a firm and sub∣stantial roof, by uniting the strength of the thirteen rafters: but that this was so far from annihilating
<PB N="308" REF="024407_0686_0FC6FA70795F9B58"/>
the several rafters, and rendering them of no use individually, that it was manifest, from a bare inspection of the plan, that the strength of each contributed to the strength of the whole, and that the existence of each and all was essential to the existence of the fabric as a roof.</P>
<P N="6">6<SUP>thly</SUP> AND lastly, he said, that the roof was, in truth, so framed as that the parts should mutually support and check each other. But it was abso∣lutely absurd, and contrary to the known laws of nature, to infer from thence, that the whole frame could stand self-supported in the air. For, how∣ever its component parts might be combined with respect to each other, the whole must necessarily rest upon and be supported by the walls. That the walls might, indeed, stand for a few years in a ruinous and uninhabitable condition, without any roof; but the roof could not, for a moment, stand without the support of the walls: and finally, that of all dangers and apprehensions, this of the roof's remaining after the walls are gone, was the most absurd and impossible.</P>
<P>IT was mentioned before, that whilst this debate was going on in the great hall, the windows and doors were crowded with attendants. Amongst these, was a half crazy fellow, who was suf∣fered
<PB N="309" REF="024407_0687_0FC6FA747A8F7098"/>
to go at large as a harmless lunatic.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A furious writer under the signature of <HI>Philadelphiensis.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Mar∣gery,</HI> however, thought he might be a serviceable engine in promoting opposition to the new roof. As people of deranged understandings are easily irritated, she exasperated this poor fellow against the architects, and filled him with terrible appre∣hensions from the new roof; making him believe that the architects had provided a dark hole in the garret, where he was to be chained for life. Having by these suggestions filled his mind with rage and terror, she turned him loose amongst the crowd, where he roared and bawled to the great annoyance of the bye-standers.</P>
<P>THIS circumstance would not have been noticed, but for the opportunity of exhibiting the style and manner in which a half deranged and highly irritat∣ed mind will express itself. One of his rhapsodies shall conclude this narrative.</P>

When a few demagogues, despis∣ing every sense of order and decency, have reject∣ed the petitions of the people, and in the most su∣percilious manner triumphed over the freemen of America, as if they were their slaves, and they themselves their lords and masters; I say, that if such barefaced presumption and arrogance, such tyran∣nical proceedings of the men, who, if acting con∣stitutionally, were the servants of the people, be not sufficient to awaken you to a sense of your duty and

<P>IT may be asserted with confidence, that besides the petitions that Mr. Whitehill presented to the convention, from Cumberland county, against the adoption of the new constitution, there is not a county or town in the state that should not have followed the example, if a reasonable time had been allowed for the petitions to come in. Now, if we consider but for a moment how contemptuously the people were treated on this occasion, we may form some idea of the way in which they are here∣after to be governed by their <HI>well born masters</HI> —<Q>The petitions being read from the chair, Mr M'Kean said, that he was sorry that at this stage of the business so <HI>improper</HI> an attempt should be made; he hoped therefore that the petitions would not be <HI>attended to.</HI></Q>
Where is the freeman in America that can tamely suffer such an insult to his dignity to pass with impunity?
<PB N="314" REF="024407_0692_0FC6F779776DE930"/>
Where is that pusillanimous wretch that can sub∣mit to this contumely? Is not this the language of Britain in the years 1775 and 1776 renewed? What said George the Third and his pampered ministers more than this to the petitions of Ameri∣ca? Is it improper for freemen to petition for their rights? If it be; then I say that the impro∣priety consisted only in their not <HI>demanding</HI> them. Propriety requires that the people should approach their representatives with a becoming humility; but the governors of a free people must ever be considered as their servants, and are therefore bound to observe decency towards them, and to act according to their instructions, and agreeably to conscience. If the petitions of the freemen of America, couched in decent and respectful terms, will not be attended to; then, be it known, that their <HI>demands</HI> must and will be granted: if no better will do, the <HI>ultima ratio regum</HI> must secure to the people their rights. God in his providence has crowned them with success once already on this head; and there is little doubt, with the same assistance, but a second attempt will termi∣nate just as much in favour of liberty.</P>

Ah! my friends, the days of a cruel Nero approach fast; the language of a monster, of a Caligula, could not be more imperious. I challenge the whole conti∣nent, the <HI>well-born and their parasites,</HI> to shew an instance of greater insolence than this, on the part of the British tyrant, and his infernal junto, to the people of America before our glorious revolution. My fellow-citizens, this is an awful crisis; your situation is alarming indeed; yourselves and your petitions are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>spised and trampled under the feet of self-impo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nt nabobs; whose diabolical plots, and secret machinations have been carried on since the revolution, with a view to destroy your liber∣ties, and reduce you to a state of slavery and de∣pendence: and, alas! I fear they have found you off your guard, and taken you by surprise. These aspiring men having seized the government, and secured all power, as they suppose to themselves, now openly brow-beat you with their insolence, and assume majesty; and even treat you like menial <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>vants, your representatives as so many conquer∣ed slaves, that they intend to make pass under

the yoke, as soon as leisure from their gluttony and rioting on the industry of the poor, shall per∣mit them to attend such a pleasing piece of sport.</P>
<P>BUT, I trust, these petty tyrants will soon find to their confusion, that their own imprudent zeal has declared their designs. Providence has ordered that they should begin to carry their arbitrary schemes too soon into execution, that boundless ambition should precipitate their destruc∣tion, and that the glory of God should be made perfect in the salvation of the poor. Blessed be his name: "he hath shewed strength with his arm: he hath scattered the proud in the imaginations of their hearts: he hath put down the mighty from their seat, and exalted them of low degree: he hath filled the hungry with good things, and the rich he hath sent empty away." As a villain, who secreted to rob and murder in the silent hour of night, issues forth from his lurking place before the people have retired to sleep, and thus frustrates his infernal design by impatience; so, in like man∣ner, the lust of dominion has urged these despots on to the adoption of measures that will inevitably, and I hope immediately, unhinge every part of their conspiracy against the rights of their fellow-men, and bring on themselves infamy and disgrace.</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="024407_0695_0FC6F78A822529F0"/>FIGURE to yourselves, my brethren▪ a man with a plantation just sufficient to raise a competency for himself and his dear little children; but by reason of the immoderate revenue necessary to support <HI>the emperor,</HI> the illustrious <HI>well-born con∣gress, the standing army,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. he necessarily fails in the payment of his <HI>taxes;</HI> then a hard-hearted federal officer seizes and sells his cows, his horses, and even the land itself must be disposed of to answer the demands of government. He pleads unfruitful seasons, his old age, and his numerous and helpless family. But, alas! these avail him nothing; his farm, his cattle, and his all are sold for less than half their value, to his wealthy neigh∣bour, already possessed of half the land in the county, to whom also, himself and his children must become servants and slaves, or else perish with hunger and want! Do I exaggerate here? No, truly. View the misery of the poor under the despotic governments of Europe and Asia, and then deny the truth of my position if you can. It is a common saying among the poor of Indos∣tan, that to lie is better than to stand, to sleep is better than to wake, but death is best of all, for it delivers them from the cruelty of their nabobs. Even in the freest country in Europe, a lady's lap-dog is more esteemed than the child of a poor

man. Oh God! what a monster is man! that a dog should be nourished and pampered up by him with dainties, whilst a being possessed of knowledge, reason, judgment, and an immortal soul, bought with no less a price than the blood of our divine Redeemer, should be driven from his door, without admitting him, even for a moment, to assuage his hunger with the crumbs that might fall from his table.</P>
<P>BUT the members of the federal convention were men who have been all tried in the field of action, say some; they have fought for American liberty: then the more to their shame be it said. Curse on the villain, who protects virgin innocence only with a view that he may himself become the ravisher; so that, if the assertion was true, it only turns to their disgrace; but, as it happens, it is not true, or at least only so in part. This was a scheme taken by the despots and their sycophants to bias the public mind in favour of the constitution; for the convention was composed of a variety of cha∣racters: ambitious men, jesuits, tories, lawyers, &amp;c. formed the majority, whose similitude to each other consisted only in their determination to lord it over their fellow-citizens; like the rays that, converging from every direction, meet in a point,
<PB N="319" REF="024407_0697_0FC6F78CEB09F5A8"/>
and their sentiments and deliberations concentered in tyranny alone; they were unanimous in form∣ing a government that should raise the fortunes and respectability of the <HI>well born</HI> few, and oppress the plebeians.</P>

<HEAD>AN INTERCEPTED LETTER FROM THE AUTHOR OF THE CENTINEL,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A most inflammatory and abusive paper under the title of THE CENTINEL.</NOTE> TO HIS FRIEND IN <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> COUNTY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA,
<DATE>Jan. 19, 1788.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received your letter by Mr ***** and am very sorry to find that your exertions in the county of ***** have been attended with so little success. I expected long before this to have heard of a commotion begun. It is indeed high time that something vigorous should be attempted, other∣wise the spirit of our cause will languish, and when once that spirit hath evaporated it will not be in our power to recal it.</P>
<P>YOU know it was always our opinion, that the great gun should be charged here in the city, and
<PB N="324" REF="024407_0702_0FC6F7A5CC6631C0"/>
fired off in one of the western counties. I am sure I have not been remiss in my part of the busi∣ness. Have I not already charged it with eleven cartridges well rammed down; and when I am every moment expecting the explosion, you only urge me to double my diligence and ram away. In short, I am almost weary of this fruitless toil. I don't find that my publications have had the desired effect here; I would fain hope that they have been more operative in the counties; if so, you should have informed me, for I want encourage∣ment more than a spur.</P>
<P>WHILST I am issuing number after number of my Centinel, all written with a freedom and spirit sufficient, one would think, to rouse the people; I say, whilst I am doing this, the states, one after another, either unanimously, or by very large ma∣jorities, are ratifying the new constitution. You have heard, or will hear, that Connecticut has a∣dopted it by a majority of 127 to 40 in their state convention. Besides this, I have the mortification to see my Centinels printed, and re-printed, but ne∣ver replied to. Attempts to answer would afford fresh sources of argument; can any thing be more provoking or discouraging? I have rung the chan∣ges upon the liberty of the press; the trial by
<PB N="325" REF="024407_0703_0FC6F7A90BF2F9A8"/>
jury; despotism and tyranny: and am reduced to the necessity of repeating in different words the same railings against the new constitution, and the same abuse against the framers of it.</P>
<P>THE novelty of this boldness is over, and my pieces are now scarcely read. I am astonished that such extraordinary exertions have had so lit∣tle effect with the people. I have directly, and without reserve, called the members of the late ge∣neral convention, with general W—n at their head, villians, traitors, fools and conspirators, col∣lectively and individually, and yet the mob does not rise. I have often told you, that it is of no great importance on which side an insurrection takes place—all that is necessary, is to have a commotion begun. A faction can always turn public confusion to its own account. I was in great hopes that the attack upon Major Boyd's house would have produced something; it was indeed serviceable to our party, but the flame was too weak to spread; the law interfered and ex∣tinguished it entirely. A mob is not worth a far∣thing, unless, by its great numbers, or the weight and influence of its leaders, it can stoutly look law in the face, and bid defiance to its operation.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="024407_0704_0FC6F7B198CAD510"/>YOU tell me that you have enlisted about 60 in∣surgents—but what can they do? 600 in each of the counties would have been more to the purpose. Either you must have been very negligent, or your influence in the county is not as great as you gave us reason to believe.</P>
<P>YOU say you have constantly attended at ta∣verns, vendues, funerals and other public meetings —liberally treated those whom your thought it might be of use to gain—distributed my Centinels, and watched the most favourable opportunities for inflaming the minds of the people. This is all ve∣ry well; but if the consequence has been no more than the association of 60 insurgents, it is certainly very poor doings. If our friends have done no better in the other counties, and I have not yet heard that they have done any thing, our party had better tack about, and cry up the new consti∣tution, that some of us may stand a chance at least for a share in the loaves and fishes. For if, notwithstanding our opposition, this new consti∣tution should be established, we shall always be looked upon as disaffected to the government, and unfit to be trusted with offices under it.</P>
<P>OUR champions in the other states begin to fall off. You have seen, I suppose, governor R—'s
<PB N="327" REF="024407_0705_0FC6F7BA1B9E1180"/>
letter; and I am told, that R— H— L— and Mr. M— have dropped all opposition. Un∣less some extraordinary exertions are made, and speedily too, our whole scheme must fall to the ground. Only imagine what a ridiculous figure I make here. I am every week publishing things, which, in any other country would bring the au∣thor to the gallows, as a seditious disturber of the public peace—and yet nothing comes of it. My performances, as I said before, do not even provoke a reply. Can any thing be more mortifying? In the mean time, the new constitution is taking root in the other states. And it must be confessed, that in every instance where the people have been legally brought together, either in conventions, or as assemblymen, grand juries▪ or otherwise, they have uniformly declared themselves in favour of it. These are great obstacles to our views. We have affected the popular side of the question, and the voice of the people is decidedly against us. Pa∣triotism, not supported by the body, the citizens is always denominated <HI>faction.</HI></P>
<P>TO conclude, unless we can do something speedily, towards raising a respectable commotion in the state, it is my opinion that we ought to prepare for join∣ing the general current in favour of this new system of government: and this may be plausibly effected by
<PB N="328" REF="024407_0706_0FC6F7BE2927A8E8"/>
declaring that we never had any thing in view but the good of our country: that the new constituti∣on appeared, in our judgments, to contain many things objectionable, and some things even danger∣ous, to the liberties of the people. But as the ge∣neral opinion seems to be otherwise, we resign our prejudices to the will of the majority, as every good citizen ought to do: and since we find that the proposed system of a federal government is indeed likely to be established, we shall not be behind any in zealous exertions for its support.</P>
<P>THINK of these things, and let me hear from you as soon as possible. In the mean time,</P>

<HEAD>OBJECTIONS TO THE PROPOSED PLAN OF A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR THE UNITED STATES, ON GENUINE PRINCIPLES.</HEAD>
<P>AT a Meeting of the <HI>Wheel-barrow</HI> Society<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Convicts condemned to the Wheel-Barrow for various crimes.</NOTE>
in the prison yard, Philadelphia, Febuary 8th. 1788.</P>
<P>Present fifty eight members.</P>
<P><HI>Jem. Doran</HI> in the chair.</P>
<P>AFTER mature discussion, the society unanimous∣ly agreed in the following FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES.</P>
<P N="1">1st <HI>Pure natural liberty,</HI> is the right of every man to do whatever he pleases <HI>without controul,</HI>
<PB N="330" REF="024407_0708_0FC6F7C0C122F460"/>
and to possess, <HI>without retribution,</HI> whatever he can acquire by his <HI>valour</HI> or <HI>address.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2<SUP>d</SUP> STATES or sovereign powers are as indivi∣duals in a state of nature; and therefore true <HI>political liberty,</HI> or the liberty of a state as a body politic, is the right of that state, or of those who are in possession of the sovereignty thereof, to do such things, and enact such laws, as may be thought conducive to the advancement of the powers and interests of that state, or of the government thereof, uncontrouled by the artificial system of restraints, known by the name of the <HI>law of nations.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3<SUP>d</SUP> ALL systems of government, whether ope∣rating on states, or on individuals, although os∣tensibly formed, and speciously declared to be for the establishment of general justice and of general good, ought to be abhorred by the true sons of freedom as invasions on, and abridgments of their natural rights.</P>
<P N="4">4th WHEREAS in the present imperfect state of things, <HI>true natural liberty,</HI> as defined in our first fundamental principle, cannot be universally enjoyed, necessity enforces a submission to what is called government, under some form or other.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="331" REF="024407_0709_0FC6F7C2244DCED8"/>5<SUP>th</SUP> ACCORDING to the foregoing principles, <HI>that</HI> form of government is the best which con∣tains the fewest restraints, and leaves in the hand of the governed the greatest portion of <HI>natural liberty,</HI> and the fullest scope for the exercise of <HI>personal prowess</HI> and <HI>native ingenuity,</HI> it being demonstrable, that if the component parts of any society are left free, and become, <HI>by any means,</HI> rich and happy, the whole of that society will be free, rich and happy.</P>
<P N="6">6th THE worst of all possible governments is that in which the vigorous operation of general laws, and a complication of internal checks, re∣straints and regulations, prevent individual states or persons from pursuing their separate interest <HI>in their own way</HI>; most wickedly sacrificing the real emolument of individuals to the visionary good and prosperity of the whole.</P>
<P>THESE <HI>fundamental principles</HI> being established, the plan of government proposed by the late gene∣ral convention for the United States was taken up; considered by paragraphs, and compared with the doctrines laid down; and after some debate the following resolutions were unanimously adop∣ted. viz.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="332" REF="024407_0710_0FC6F7C87014DA68"/>1<SUP>st</SUP> RESOLVED, That the constitution proposed for the United States, is a <HI>consolidated government,</HI> pregnant with the seeds of coercion and re∣straint, and therefore a system of tyranny and oppression.</P>
<P N="2">2<SUP>d</SUP> RESOLVED, That under such a government, neither states nor individuals can do, or refuse to do, whatever they please in all cases; which is a direct infringement on the natural liberty of both, as defined in our first fundamental principle.</P>
<P N="3">3<SUP>d</SUP> RESOLVED, That under such a government, men of education, abilities, and property, common∣ly called the <HI>well-born,</HI> will be most likely to get into places of power and trust, to the exclusion of a large majority of citizens of a contrary description.</P>
<P N="4">4<SUP>th</SUP> RESOLVED, That as this constitution most arbitrarily and inhumanly prohibits the emission of <HI>Paper-Money,</HI> and other resources by which the unfortunate debtor may throw off the dis∣couraging burthen of his obligations, it ought to to be considered, as in fact it is, a system of tyran∣ny and oppression, compelling citizens, in many instances, to do things extremely disagreeable and contrary to their present interest.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="333" REF="024407_0711_0FC6F7CCAFB2B180"/>5<SUP>th</SUP> RESOLVED, That under such a government, the industrious and wealthy may enjoy their pro∣perty in security, to the great injury of those who have no property at all.</P>
<P N="6">6<SUP>th</SUP> RESOLVED, That under such a government, there will be no encouragement for gentlemen of adventure and address, to procure subsistence and wealth by extraordinary modes of acquirement; because what is called the vigour of government will pervade the whole union.</P>
<P N="7">7<SUP>th</SUP> RESOLVED, That the system proposed, is consonant with our 6<SUP>th</SUP> fundamental principle, and the worst of all possible governments; and therefore,</P>
<P N="8">8<SUP>th</SUP> RESOLVED, That the members of the late general convention, who framed, voted for, and recommended this plan of government, and all state conventions which have, or hereafter shall adopt and ratify the same; and all those indivi∣duals, who by word of mouth, by writing and publishing, or by any other means, shall express their approbation of the said infamous constitu∣tion are, and ought to be, considered by all the true sons of liberty, as demagogues, aristocraties,
<PB N="334" REF="024407_0712_0FC6F7D635A34320"/>
conspirators, traitors, tyrants, and enemies of the natural rights of mankind.</P>
<P N="9">9<SUP>th</SUP> RESOLVED, That as we are the most nu∣merous and respectable body that hath as yet combined formally to avow and publish a disap∣probation of this new constitution, it is fit and proper that we should be regularly organised, that other worthy mal-contents in this and the other states may, by association or election, be annexed to our community, and so form a union of strength to oppose the establishment of this tyrannical go∣vernment; therefore,</P>
<P N="10">10<SUP>th</SUP> RESOLVED, That we will now proceed to the election of a president, vice-president, and secretary.</P>

<HEAD>SOME THOUGHTS ON THE <HI>DISEASES</HI> OF THE <HI>MIND</HI>; WITH A SCHEME FOR PURGING THE MORAL FACULTIES OF THE <HI>GOOD PEOPLE</HI> OF <HI>PENNSYLVANIA.</HI> QUITE NEW AND VERY PHILOSOPHICAL.</HEAD>
<P>THAT there is an intimate connection between the soul and the body, and that the one is apt to be affected by the disorders and irregularities of the other, is a truth too manifest to be controverted. How this connection is formed, to what extent it ex∣ists, and what are the visible organs of the body which compose the intermediate links of union, with
<PB N="337" REF="024407_0715_0FC6F7DA4B8CF478"/>
the invisible faculties of the mind, are problems which have been often in vain attempted. I neither pretend to have found out the secret, nor have I, at present, any plausible hypothesis to propose on this delicate subject.</P>
<P>THIS mutual influence, however, which plainly exists between spirit and matter in all animals, and more especially in man, hath produced many pro∣mising devices for remedying the disorders of the mind, which seem to be beyond our reach, by at∣tacking the organs of the body, which are within our power. A late ingenious author <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Rush.</NOTE> has gone great lengths in this hypothesis, in his "<HI>Dissertation on the effect of physical causes on the moral faculty.</HI>"</P>
<P>FOR my own part, I believe there is some truth in the doctrine; and that, in particular cases, if applied with great judgment, a partial and tempo∣rary effect may be obtained. But if the seat of the disease should really be in the mind, it will be in vain to expect a <HI>radical</HI> cure, by medical attacks on the body, which can do no more than for the pre∣sent deprive the mind of the instruments by which she exhibits her distempered faculties.</P>
<P>FOR instance: suppose a person to be of an iras∣cible,
<PB N="338" REF="024407_0716_0FC6F7E179214650"/>
captious disposition, subject to violent and ungovernable gusts of passion. To reduce his body by phlebotomy, emetics, cathartics, a slender regi∣men, &amp;c. would probably produce a dejection of spirits, and an apparent calmness of temper. But must this man be kept all his life time in a state of debility? For there is no doubt but that as soon as health and vigour are allowed to return, the angry dispositions will return too, and perhaps with en∣creased inveteracy, on account of the restriction. So, also, if I should be infected with a troublesome itch for scribbling—which heaven forbid! and my friends, with a view to a cure, should deprive me of pen, ink, and paper. For the present, to be sure, I could not scribble: but would the itch be removed?—Far from it—the scribbling matter being refused a discharge, would accumulate, and become more virulent: and so soon as the necessary instruments or organs of exhibition could be pro∣cured, I should scribble worse than ever.</P>
<P>THIS scheme of whipping the mind over the bo∣dy's shoulders will not, I apprehend, answer any permanent purpose: and I know of no well au∣thenticated cases in support of the doctrine. Hath government ever cured a propensity to theft by the administration of the whipping-post or the wheel-barrow? Amongst the innumerable experi∣ments
<PB N="339" REF="024407_0717_0FC6F7E26ED0F088"/>
that have been made, I never heard of one successful instance—No; it seems more natural, that mental remedies should be prescribed for mental disorders; and corporeal physic for bodily diseases. Let there be physicians and metaphysicians as two distinct professions. I do not mean by <HI>metaphysicians,</HI> such as are now professors in universities and col∣leges; but <HI>practising metaphysicians,</HI> who shall stu∣dy the disorders and irregularities of the human mind, and prescribe for their cure.</P>
<P>I have considered this matter very attentively, and am confident that many of the cares and evils of life might be removed or alleviated by a judici∣ous metaphysical treatment. The first difficulty would be to gain the confidence of the patient in a new science; for this confidence would be as ne∣cessary to the metaphysical as it is to the physical cure of diseases—and even more so—for the imagi∣nation would have a great share in the business, and must indeed serve as apothecary to the meta∣physician. Wherein does the virtue of pills, po∣tions, and plaisters principally consist? Surely not so much in the ingredients of which they are com∣posed, as in the implicit faith of those to whom they are administered: a proof of which is, that no sooner is the composition generally known but it sinks into general contempt; nobody will take a
<PB N="340" REF="024407_0718_0FC6F7E55A02A160"/>
detected nostrum. If, then, this confidence, this im∣plicit faith of the patient, is so useful in the opera∣tion of <HI>material</HI> medicine, much more should it be cultivated and depended upon in a <HI>metaphysical</HI>
case. Possessed of this, I would undertake, with flattering hopes of success, to heal the maladies of the mind by the use of discreet and obviously ratio∣nal means.</P>
<P>FOR instance: should I find my patient disposed to melancholy, and his mind clouded with imagi∣nary doubts, difficulties, and fears, by poring over polemical divinity, and wading deep in inscrutable mysteries; I would prescribe a round of amuse∣ments, much company, and frequent changes of companions. I would by every artifice provoke him to frequent laughter, and plunge him deep in the vanities of this wicked world: but they should be vanities only; for I would on no account violate the bounds of strict morality.</P>
<P>TO a patient of a contrary cast: vain, fickle, loquacious, and full of levity, I would forbid the most innocent recreations. I would prescribe a chapter in the history of the martyrs every morning before breakfast: he should study algebra till din∣ner time; in the evening he should hear a long dull sermon delivered with an unbroken monotony;
<PB N="341" REF="024407_0719_0FC6F7E619429168"/>
and should himself read one of our acts of assembly before going to bed: and I would continue my regimen and remedies until I saw an entire change of disposition take place, and a radical cure ob∣tained.</P>
<P>BUT I am preparing a full account of the diseases of the mind, with the proper mode of treatment in each, illustrated by a variety of cases. This work hath cost me much study and deep searches into human nature, and the subtile springs and move∣ments of the moral faculty. Although my book is almost ready for publication, yet the evils of the present time call so loudly for redress, that I can∣not delay giving an extract from my chapter on the <HI>epidemic</HI> diseases of the mind, in hopes it may be of immediate use.</P>
<P><Q><HI>CACOETHES maledictionis,</HI> or an insatiable rage for slander and abuse. This disease is peculiar to free governments. The proximate causes are envy, discontent, and an over-weening ambition. The diagnostic symptoms are an inveterate ha∣tred of men of wealth or abilities, and particu∣larly of those in public offices, and an unusual predominance of party spirit: and the crisis of the distemper is an acrimonious eruption, dis∣charging a deal of prurient matter in private com∣panies, or in the public papers. The curative
<PB N="342" REF="024407_0720_0FC6F7F93A754D30"/>
indication is manifest, for this, like many other mental diseases, is best managed by allowing a free emission of the peccant humours, and permitting the moral faculty to purge itself by natural dis∣charges of the malevolent ichor.</Q></P>
<P>THIS quotation suggests an observation or two which will lead directly to my present purpose. It is recommended, that the moral faculty should be permitted to <HI>purge itself</HI> by natural discharges. Now, there are but two possible ways by which the mind can discharge her contents in the <HI>cacoethes maledictionis;</HI> viz. by <HI>actions,</HI> and by <HI>words;</HI> either by speaking, scolding, storming, swearing, writing, or publishing. When these means are forbid, or not conveniently obtained, the disease breaks out into <HI>actions;</HI> viz. beating, bruising, mawling, cuf∣fing, kicking, and even murdering, killing, and so forth: and, therefore, a free scope should be given to <HI>words,</HI> as the most salutary and safe issue of the malignant matter.</P>
<P>THE art of printing has been a great blessing to mankind, inasmuch as it affords a most convenient opportunity for the people to discharge their minds of indigested crudities and rankling spleen. Before this invention, murders, assassinations, rebellions, and revolutions, were much more frequent than
<PB N="343" REF="024407_0721_0FC6F7FCB1FFB2A8"/>
since. The poisoned cup, and the bloody dagger, are not known in countries where the press, and and the free use of it, are allowed. As this is a new and a very deep remark, I hope it will be attend∣ed to. I know that the less sanguinary character of modern times is generally attributed to the pro∣gress of civilization. But how has this civilization been advanced? Certainly by the vent which the press affords for the morbid minds of the people to get rid of their impurities, and by keeping up a free circulation of ideas, so necessary to the men∣tal health of man. As a proof, we see that, in countries where a free access to the press is not permitted, the <HI>stilletto</HI> is, even at this day, in use.</P>
<P>I come now to make the proposal which I had in view when I sat down to write this paper; a proposal which, I flatter myself, will correct and mollify, if not totally remove, the virulence of party spirit and personal animosity in this state, and especially in the city; and sweeten and pu∣rify the political atmosphere of our common∣wealth. The preface to this my project is, I con∣fess, rather long; but it was necessary to shew the metaphysical grounds on which it is founded.</P>
<P>LET there be two public papers instituted. The one a weekly and the other a daily paper.
<PB N="344" REF="024407_0722_0FC6F7FE31F82128"/>
Let the printers be commissioned by government, and allowed competent salaries for their time and trouble. They should be <HI>commissioned,</HI> because all other printers should be prohibited from interfer∣ing in their department. One of these papers may be entitled <HI>The Freeman's Convenience,</HI> and the other <HI>The Chronicle of Scandal.</HI> Let these offices be always open as places where the good people of Pennsylvania may ease their minds without restraint, rebuke, or any hindrance what∣ever. And whereas some men are naturally bash∣ful, and do not like to be seen doing their occa∣sions, there shall not only be a number of fictitious signatures provided for their concealment, but the printer shall, for the purpose of decency, have a tin plate fixed in his window, fronting on a little alley, if his situation will permit, otherwise on the street; in which, there shall be a slit, or opening large enough to receive, secretly, any ex∣crementitious matter; and it shall, for distinction's sake, be thus inscribed—"<HI>Wha' wants me?</HI> Last∣ly, the printers, their papers, and their authors should all be <HI>outlawed.</HI> That is, they should be considered as beyond the reach of any censure or penalty of common or statute law, or restrictions by any ordinance, proclamation, or regulation whatever.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="024407_0723_0FC6F807213F0C20"/>BY this institution all our other public papers would be kept free from impurities, and occupied, as they ought to be, with interesting or amusing articles of intelligence, grave or humourous essays, advertisements, &amp;c. and all the filth of the city would be carried off by the two commissioned papers. So that after a little time, it would be∣come as shocking to good manners for a man to vent his spleen in one of the public <HI>news</HI>-papers, properly so called, as it would be to commit an in∣decent evacuation in a private parlour, or a pub∣lic assembly. And thus also would the minds of the people be kept sweet and healthy. For we may refine as we will, but the mind certainly has her indecencies as well as the body, and, when overloaded with indigested matter, must find a vent somewhere. For nature will be obeyed, and surely good policy requires that a suitable place should be provided for the purpose, rather than that the public sense should be continually offend∣ed by the evacuations of every distempered mind, which, though necessary, are neither decked with roses nor perfumed with amber.</P>
<P>YET I would not exclude from the common pa∣pers of the city attempts at wit and satire, or lit∣tle effusions in verse, in the poet's corner. A sarcasm is nothing more than spitting; and so it is usual
<PB N="346" REF="024407_0724_0FC6F808DDB39788"/>
to say—"He has spit his spite"—A crude attempt at humour is parallel with blowing one's nose, for such humours are apt to collect in cold constitu∣tions; and a young poetaster may be put into a considerable perspiration by the scorching flames of love—These may all happen in the best com∣pany without offence, provide they are conducted with decency; and they are certainly necessary to health.</P>
<P>I shall conclude with an account of two cases, in proof of my general system.</P>
<P>I knew a young man, about 32 years of age, who, from losses in trade and crosses in love, began to grow melancholy, retired and discontented. He came to me for advice. I asked him if he had ever tried to write verses. He told me that he had upon two or three occasions, and found that he could tack rhymes together pretty well; but had no thoughts of cultivating the ta∣lent. But I advised by all means to try what he could do in that way. He followed my prescrip∣tion; and employed himself for a year or two in writing sonnets to Mira, Odes to Liberty, and Elegies to birds, and dead lap-dogs, with a variety of other subjects, according to the course of the humours that infected his mind. He is now of a calm, con∣templative
<PB N="347" REF="024407_0725_0FC6F80A5E502D78"/>
habit, but far from melancholy; on the contrary, he is delighted with his own per∣formances, and enjoys the comfort of <HI>self-applause,</HI> which, after all, is the most substantial comfort of life.</P>
<P>MY second instance is that of a German Doc∣tor, who has had, or thinks he has had, a vision, in which the mysteries and oeconomy of the spiritual world was manifested to him. He has told me the story of this vision, and a very long story it is—but I heard it all with patient attention. Some time after, he wanted to tell me the same story over again, but I begged to be excused. Upon which he candidly assured me, that he found it absolutely necessary to relate the history of his vi∣sion, at least once a week, otherwise he grew rest∣less and uneasy in his mind. He came indeed full up to my present system, and said, and in direct terms, that it was <HI>a necessary evacuation of his mind.</HI></P>
<P>THE practice of the law affords, I confess, a convenient out-let for much mental virulence. Not only what are called <HI>spite-actions,</HI> but many suits of a more sober aspect, are only extravasations of mental bile. But this process is to expensive and too tedious for general use. My proposal
<PB N="348" REF="024407_0726_0FC6F814E678E850"/>
is, I think, much better in every respect. It is a scheme by which envy and revenge may be gra∣tified without danger and without cost, and abuse, slander, and invective spend themselves, like rock∣ets, in harmless explosions. For no man, in his senses, will ever think of giving credit to any thing contained in the <HI>Freeman's Convenience or Chronicle of Scandal.</HI></P>

<P>☞As I not only drew up for publication the following account of the grand procession, performed at Philadelphia on the 4th of July 1788; but had no small share in planning and directing the arrangement of it, and as it was a spectacle as singular in itself as the occasion was extraordinary, I have thought proper to give it a place here, that the remembrance of it may have one more chance of preservation in addition to those of the Newspapers of the time.</P>

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE GRAND FEDERAL PROCESSION. PERFORMED AT PHILADELPHIA ON <DATE>FRIDAY THE 4th OF JULY 1778.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>ON Friday the 4th of July 1788, the citi∣zens of Philadelphia celebrated the declaration of <HI>Independence,</HI> made by the Thirteen United States of America on the 4th of July 1776, and the establishment of the <HI>constitution,</HI> or frame
<PB N="350" REF="024407_0728_0FC6F817DAC66E60"/>
of government proposed by the late general con∣vention of the states, and now solemnly adopted and ratified by ten of those states.</P>
<P>THE rising sun was saluted with a full peal from Christ Church steeple, and a discharge of cannon from the ship, <HI>Rising Sun,</HI> commanded by Captain Philip Brown, anchored off Market street, and superbly decorated with the flags of na∣tions in alliance with America.</P>
<P>TEN vessels, in honour of the ten states of the present union, were dressed and arranged the whole length of the harbour; each bearing a broad white flag at the mast-head, inscribed with the names of the states respectively in broad gold let∣ters, in the following order; <HI>New Hampshire,</HI> opposite to the Northern Liberties; <HI>Massachusetts,</HI> opposite to Vine street; <HI>Connecticut,</HI> to Race street; <HI>New Jersey,</HI> to Arch street; <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> to Market street; <HI>Delaware</HI> to Chesnut street; <HI>Ma∣ryland,</HI> to Walnut street; <HI>Virginia</HI> to Spruce street; <HI>South Carolina,</HI> to Pine street; and <HI>Geor∣gia,</HI> to South street. The ships along the wharfs were also dressed on the occasion; and as a brisk south wind prevailed through the whole day, the flags and pennants were kept in full display; and exhibited a most pleasing and animating prospect.</P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="024407_0729_0FC6F81FE06672E8"/>ACCORDING to orders issued the day before, the several parts which were to compose this grand procession, began to assemble at eight o'clock in the morning, at and near the intersection of South and Third-streets.</P>
<P>NINE gentlemen, distinguished by white plumes in their hats, and furnished with speaking trum∣pets, were superintendants of the procession; viz. general <HI>Mifflin,</HI> general <HI>Stewart,</HI> colonel <HI>Proctor,</HI> colonel <HI>Gurney,</HI> colonel <HI>Will,</HI> colonel <HI>Marsh,</HI> ma∣jor <HI>Moore,</HI> major <HI>Lenox,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Peter Brown.</HI></P>
<P>THE different companies of military, trades and professions, had previously met in various parts of the city, of their own appointment; where they were separately formed by their officers and con∣conductors, and marched in order with their re∣spective flags, devices, and machines, to the place of general rendezvous. As these companies arriv∣ed in succession, the superintendants disposed of them in the neighbouring streets in such manner as that they might easily fall into the stations they were to occupy in forming the general procession, as they should be successively called upon. By this means the most perfect order and regularity was effectually preserved.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="024407_0730_0FC6F82942EC7D48"/>AFTER a strict review of the streets of the city, it had been determined, that the line of march should be as follows. To commence at the inter∣section of South and Third-streets; thence along Third-street to Callowhill-street; thence up Cal∣lowhill-street to Fourth-street; thence along Fourth-street to Market-street; and thence to UNION GREEN, in front of Bush-Hill—<HI>William Hamilton, esq.</HI> having kindly offered the spacious lawn before his house at Bush-Hill for the purpo∣ses of the day.</P>
<P>THE street commissioners had, the evening be∣fore, gone through the line of march, and directed the pavements to be swept, the trees to be lopped, and all obstacles removed.</P>
<P>ABOUT half after nine o'clock the GRAND PROCESSION began to move; of which the follow∣ing is as correct a detail as could be procured.</P>

horses. This building was in the form of a dome, supported by 13 Corinthian columns, raised on pedestals proper to that order: the frize decorated with 13 stars. Ten of the columns were complete, but three left unfinished. On the pedestals of the columns were inscribed, in ornamented cyphers, the initials of the 13 American states. On the top of the dome was a handsome cupola, surmount∣ed by a figure of plenty, bearing a cornucopia, and other emblems of her character. The dimen∣sions of this building were as follows—10 feet diameter—11 feet to the top of the cornice—the dome 4 feet high—the cupola 5 feet high—the figure of plenty 3 ½ feet high—the carriage on which the building was mounted 3 feet high—the whole 36 feet in height. Round the pedestal of the edifice, these words, "IN UNION THE FABRIC STANDS FIRM."</P>
<P>THIS elegant edifice was begun and finished in the short space of four days by Messrs. <HI>William Williams &amp; Co.</HI></P>
<P>THE grand edifice was followed by architects and house-carpenters, in number 450, carrying in∣signia of the trade, preceded by Messrs. <HI>Benjamin Loxley, Gunning Bedford, Thomas Nevil, Levi Budd, Joseph Ogilby,</HI> and <HI>William Roberts,</HI> display∣ing

<P>TO this corps, the saw makers and file cutters attached themselves; headed by Messrs. <HI>John Harper</HI> and <HI>William Cook,</HI> with a flag—a hand and a saw-mill-saw, gilt, on a pink field.</P>
<P>ON the floor of the grand edifice were ten chairs for the accommodation of ten gentlemen, viz. Messrs. <HI>Hilary Baker, George Latimer, John Wharton, John Nesbitt, Samuel Morris, John Brown, Tench Francis, Joseph Anthony, John Chaloner,</HI> and <HI>Benjamin Fuller.</HI> These gentlemen sat as representatives of the citizens at large, to whom the federal constitution was committed pre∣vious to its ratification.</P>
<P>WHEN the grand edifice arrived at <HI>Union Green,</HI> these gentlemen gave up their seats to the repre∣sentatives of the states, mentioned in article XV, who entered the temple, and fixed their flags to the corinthian columns, to which they respectively be∣longed. In the evening, the edifice, with the ten gentlemen representing the states <HI>now in union,</HI> was brought back in great triumph, and with loud huzzas, and left in the area before the state-house.</P>

The workmanship and appearance of this beautiful object commanded universal attention and applause, and did great and merited honour to the artists of Philadelphia, who were concerned in her construc∣tion. She was mounted on a carriage drawn by ten horses. A large sheet of canvas was tacked all around along her water line, and, extending over a light frame, hung down to the ground, so as to conceal the wheels and machinery; and the canvas

<P><HI>A people, free and enlightened, establishing and ratifying a system of government which they have previously considered, examined, and approved!</HI> This is the sepctacle which we are assembled to cele∣brate; and it is the most dignified one, that has yet appeared on our globe. Numerous and splen∣did have been the triumphs of conquerors. From what causes have they originated? Of what con∣sequences have they been productive? They have generally begun in ambition; they have generally ended in tyran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ But nothing tyrannical can
<PB N="403" REF="024407_0781_0FC6F8ED6C745348"/>
participate of dignity; and to Freedom's eye, <HI>Sesostris</HI> himself appears contemptible, even when he treads on the <HI>necks of kings.</HI></P>
<P>THE senators of Rome, seated on their curule chairs, and surrounded with all their official lus∣tre, were an object much more respectable; and we view, without displeasure, the admiration of those untutored savages, who considered them as so many gods upon earth. But who were those senators? They were only a <HI>part</HI> of a society; they were invested only with <HI>inferior</HI> powers.</P>
<P>WHAT is the object exhibited to our contem∣plation? A <HI>whole people</HI> exercising its <HI>first and greatest power,</HI> performing an act of <HI>sovereignty, original and unlimited!</HI></P>
<P>THE scene before us is <HI>unexampled</HI> as well as <HI>magnificent.</HI> The greatest part of governments have been the deformed offspring of force and fear. With these we deign not comparison. But there have been others who have formed bold pretensions to higher regard. You have heard of <HI>Sparta,</HI> of <HI>Athens,</HI> and of <HI>Rome.</HI> You have heard of their admired constitutions, and of their high prized freedom. In fancied right of these, they conceived themselves to be elevated above the
<PB N="404" REF="024407_0782_0FC6F8F0779BF258"/>
rest of the human race, whom they marked with the degrading title of <HI>barbarians.</HI> But did they, in all their pomp and pride of liberty, ever furnish to the astonished world an exhibition similar to that which we now contemplate? Were their con∣stitutions framed by those who were appointed for that purpose by the people? Were they sub∣mitted to the consideration of the people? Had the people an opportunity of expressing their sen∣timents concerning them? Were they to <HI>stand</HI> or <HI>fall</HI> by the people's <HI>approving</HI> or <HI>rejecting</HI> vote? To all these questions attentive and impartial hi∣story obliges us to answer in the negative. The people were either unfit to be trusted, or their law-givers were too ambitious to trust them.</P>
<P>THE far famed establishment of <HI>Lycurgus</HI> was introduced by deception and fraud. Under the specious pretence of consulting the oracle concer∣ning his laws, he prevailed on the Spartans to make a temporary experiment of them during his absence, and <HI>to swear</HI> that they would suffer no alteration of them till his return. Taking a dis∣ingenuous advantage of their scrupulous regard for their oaths, he prevented his return, by a vo∣luntary death; and in this manner endeavoured to secure a proud immortality to his system.</P>
<P><PB N="405" REF="024407_0783_0FC6F8F6D8570888"/>EVEN <HI>Solon,</HI> the mild and moderating <HI>Solon,</HI> far from considering himself as employed only to <HI>pro∣pose</HI> such regulations as he should think best calcu∣lated for promoting the happiness of the com∣monwealth, <HI>made</HI> and <HI>promulgated</HI> his laws with all the haughty airs of absolute power. On more occa∣sions than one, we find him boasting with much self-complacency, of his extreme forbearance and con∣descension, because he did not establish a disposition, in his own favour, and because he did not reduce his equals to the humiliating condition of his slaves.</P>
<P>DID <HI>Numa</HI> submit his <HI>Institutions</HI> to the good sense and free investigation of <HI>Rome?</HI> They were received in precious communications from the goddess <HI>Egeria,</HI> with whose presence and re∣gard he was supremely favoured; and they were imposed on the easy faith of the citizens, as the dictates of an inspiration that was divine.</P>
<P>SUCH, my fellow-citizens, was the origin of the most splendid establishments that have been hitherto known; and such were the arts to which they owed their introduction and success.</P>
<P>WHAT a flattering contrast arises from a re∣trospect of the scenes which we now commemo∣rate? Delegates were <HI>appointed</HI> to deliberate and
<PB N="406" REF="024407_0784_0FC6F8F921A9B0E8"/>
<HI>propose.</HI> They met, and performed their delega∣ted trust. The result of their deliberations <HI>was laid before the people.</HI> It was discussed and scruti∣nised in the <HI>fullest, freest,</HI> and <HI>severest</HI> manner; by <HI>speaking,</HI> by <HI>writing,</HI> and by <HI>printing</HI>; by <HI>individuals,</HI> and by <HI>public bodies;</HI> by its <HI>friends,</HI> and by its <HI>enemies.</HI> What was the issue? Most <HI>favourable</HI> and most <HI>glorious</HI> to the system. By state after state, at time after time, it was ratified; in some states <HI>unanimously</HI>; on the whole, by a large and very respectable majority.</P>
<P>IT would be improper now to examine its qua∣lities. A decent respect for those who have ac∣cepted of it will lead us to presume that it is wor∣thy of their acceptance. The deliberate ratifica∣tions which have taken place, at once, recom∣mend the <HI>system,</HI> and the <HI>people</HI> by whom it has been ratified.</P>
<P>BUT why? Methinks I hear one say, Why is so much exultation displayed in celebrating this event? We are prepared to give the reasons of our joy. We rejoice, because, under this consti∣tution, we hope to see <HI>just government,</HI> and to en∣joy the blessings that walk in her train.</P>
<P><PB N="407" REF="024407_0785_0FC6F8FCA64FE450"/>LET us begin with <HI>peace</HI>; the mild and modest harbinger of felicity. How seldom does the amia∣ble wanderer choose for her permanent residence the habitations of men! In their systems, she sees too many arrangements, civil and ecclesiastical, in∣consistent with the calmness and benignity of her temper. In the old world, how many millions of men do we behold unprofitable to society, burdensome to industry, the props of establishments that deserve not to be supported, the causes of distrust in times of peace, and the instruments of destruction in the times of war! Why are they not employed in cultivating useful arts, and in forwarding public im∣provements? Let us indulge the pleasing expec∣tation, that such will be the <HI>operation</HI> of <HI>government</HI> in the United States. Why may we not hope, that, disentangled from the intrigues and jealou∣sies of European politics, and unmolested with the alarm and solicitude to which those intrigues and jealousies give birth, our councils will be di∣rected to the encouragement, and our strength be exerted in the cultivation, of <HI>all the arts of peace</HI>?</P>
<P>OF those, the first is AGRICULTURE—this is true in all countries. In the United States, its truth is of peculiar importance. The subsistence of man, the materials of manufactures, the articles
<PB N="408" REF="024407_0786_0FC6F8FDDC379648"/>
of commerce; all spring originally from <HI>the soil.</HI> On <HI>agriculture,</HI> therefore, <HI>the wealth of nations</HI> is founded. Whether we consult the observations that reason will suggest, or attend to the informa∣tion that history will give, we shall in each case be satisfied of the influence of government, good or bad, upon the state of <HI>agriculture.</HI> In a government, whose maxims are those of oppression, property is insecure: it is given, it is taken away by caprice. Where there is no security for property, there is no encouragement for industry. Without industry, the richer the soil, the more it abounds with weeds. The evidence of industry warrants the truth of these general remarks: attend to <HI>Greece;</HI> and compare her agriculture in <HI>ancient</HI> and <HI>modern</HI> times. <HI>Then,</HI> smiling harvest bore testimony to the bountiful boons of liberty: <HI>now,</HI> the very earth languishes under oppression. View the <HI>Campania</HI> of <HI>Rome:</HI> how melancholy the prospect! Which ever way you turn your afflicted eyes, scenes of desolation croud before them. Waste and bar∣renness appear around you in all their hideous forms. What is the reason? With <HI>double tyranny</HI> the land is cursed. Open the classic page—you trace, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>haste description, the beautiful reverse of every thing you have seen. Whence proceeds the dif∣ference?
<PB N="409" REF="024407_0787_0FC6F8FFB9AD6D38"/>
When the description was made, the force of liberty pervaded the soil.</P>
<P>BUT is <HI>agriculture</HI> the only art which feels the influence of government? Over <HI>manufactures</HI> and <HI>commerce</HI> its power is equally prevalent: there the same causes operate; and there they produce the same effects. The industrious village, the busy city, the crouded port—all these are the gifts of <HI>liberty</HI>—and without a good government, liberty cannot exist.</P>
<P>THESE are advantages; but these are not <HI>all</HI> the advantages that result from a system of good government. Agriculture, manufactures, and commerce will ensure to us plenty, convenience, and elegance. But is there not something still wanting to finish the man? Are <HI>internal</HI> virtues and accomplishments less estimable or less attractive than <HI>external</HI> arts and ornaments? Is the operation of government less powerful upon the <HI>former</HI> than upon the <HI>latter?</HI> By no means: upon this, as upon a preceding topic, reason and history will concur in their information and advice. In a serene mind the <HI>sciences</HI> and the <HI>virtues</HI> love to dwell. But can the mind of a man be serene, when the proper∣ty, liberty, subsistence of himself, and of those for whom he feels more than for himself, depend on a
<PB N="410" REF="024407_0788_0FC6F906277EF640"/>
tyrant's nod? If the dispirited subject of oppression can with difficulty exert his enfeebled faculties so far as to provide, on the incessant demands of nature, food, just enough to lengthen out his wretched exis∣tence, can it be expected that, in such a state, he will experience those fine and vigorous movements of the soul, without the full and free exercise of which <HI>science</HI> and <HI>virtue</HI> will never flourish? Look around to the nations that now exist. View in hi∣storic retrospect nations that have hitherto existed; the collected result will be an entire conviction of these all interesting truths:—<HI>Where TYRANNY reigns, there is the country of IGNORANCE and VICE. Where GOOD GOVERNMENT prevails, there is the country of SCIENCE and VIRTUE.</HI> Under a <HI>good government,</HI> therefore, we must look for <HI>the accomplished man.</HI></P>
<P>BUT shall we confine our views even here? While we wish to be accomplished <HI>men</HI> and <HI>citizens,</HI> shall we wish to be <HI>nothing more?</HI> While we per∣form our duty, and promote our happiness in <HI>this</HI> world, shall we bestow no regard upon the <HI>next?</HI> Does no connection subsist between <HI>the two?</HI> From this connection flows the most important of all the blessings of good government. But here let us pause: <HI>unassisted reason</HI> can guide us no farther: she directs us to that <HI>heaven descended science,</HI> by
<PB N="411" REF="024407_0789_0FC6F9085BD64050"/>
which LIFE and IMMORTALITY <HI>have been brought to light.</HI></P>
<P>MAY we not now say that we have reason for our joy? But while we cherish the delightful emo∣tion, let us remember those things which are re∣quisite to give it <HI>permanence</HI> and <HI>stability.</HI> Shall we lie supine, and look in listless langour for those blessings and enjoyments to which <HI>exertion</HI> is inse∣parably attached? If we would be <HI>happy,</HI> we must be <HI>active.</HI> The <HI>constitution,</HI> and our <HI>manners,</HI> must mutually support and be supported. Even on <HI>this</HI> festivity, it will not be disagreeable or incongruous to review the virtues and manners that both <HI>justify</HI> and <HI>adorn</HI> it.</P>
<P><HI>FRUGALITY</HI> and <HI>temperance</HI> first attract our at∣tention. These simple, but powerful virtues, are the sole foundation on which a good government can rest with security: they were the virtues which nursed and educated <HI>infant ROME,</HI> and prepared her for all her greatness. But in the giddy hour of her prosperity, she spurned from her the ob∣scure instruments by which it was acquired; and in their place substituted <HI>luxury</HI> and <HI>dissipation.</HI> The consequence was such as might have been ex∣pected: she preserved, for some time, a gay and flourishing appearance; but the internal health
<PB N="412" REF="024407_0790_0FC6F74A38FE6C70"/>
and soundness of her constitution was gone. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> last she fell a victim to the poisonous draughts which were administered by her perfidious favou∣rites. The fate of Rome, both in her <HI>rising</HI> and in her <HI>falling</HI> state, will be the fate of every other nation that shall follow <HI>both</HI> parts of her example.</P>
<P>INDUSTRY appears next among the virtues of a good citizen. Idleness is the nurse of villains. The industrious alone constitute a nation's strength. I will not expatiate on this fruitful subject: let one animating reflection suffice. In a <HI>well consti∣tuted commonwealth,</HI> the industry of every citizen extends beyond himself. A common interest per∣vades the society. <HI>Each</HI> gains from ALL, and <HI>all</HI> gain from EACH. It has often been observed, that the <HI>sciences</HI> flourish <HI>all together;</HI> the remark applies equally to the <HI>arts.</HI></P>
<P>YOUR patriotic feelings attest the truth of what I say, when, among the virtues necessary to merit and preserve the advantages of a good govern∣ment, I number a <HI>warm</HI> and <HI>uniform</HI> attachment to LIBERTY, and to the CONSTITUTION. The ene∣mies of liberty are artful and insiduous. A <HI>coun∣terfeit</HI> steals her <HI>dress,</HI> imitates her <HI>manners,</HI> forges
<PB N="413" REF="024407_0791_0FC6F74B9D258088"/>
her <HI>signature,</HI> assumes her <HI>name:</HI> but the real name of the deceiver is LICENTIOUSNESS. Such is her effrontery, that she will charge liberty to her face with imposture; and she will, with shameless front, insist that herself alone is the <HI>genuine character,</HI> and that herself alone is entitled to the respect which the <HI>genuine character</HI> deserves. With the giddy and undiscerning, on whom a deeper impression is made by dauntless impudence, than by modest me∣rit, her pretensions are often successful. <HI>She</HI> re∣receives the h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ours of liberty; and liberty herself is treated as a <HI>traitor</HI> and an <HI>usurper.</HI> Generally, however, this bold impostor acts only a <HI>secon∣dary</HI> part. Though she alone appear upon the stage, her motions are regulated by <HI>dark ambition,</HI> who stands concealed behind the curtain, and who knows that <HI>despotism,</HI> his other favourite, can al∣ways follow the success of <HI>licentiousness.</HI> Against these enemies of <HI>liberty,</HI> who act in concert, though they appear on opposite sides, the patriot citizen will keep a watchful guard.</P>
<P><HI>A good constitution</HI> is the greatest blessing which a society can enjoy. Need I infer, that it is the duty of every citizen to use his best and most un∣remitting endeavours for preserving it pure, health∣ful, and vigorous? For the accomplishment of this
<PB N="414" REF="024407_0792_0FC6F74D23CB8748"/>
great purpose, the exertions of no one citizen are unimportant. Let no one, therefore, harbour for a moment the mean idea that he is, and can be of no value to his country. Let the contrary manly impression animate his soul. Every one can, at <HI>many</HI> times, perform to the state <HI>useful services;</HI> and he who steadily pursues the road of patriotism has the most inviting prospect, of being able, at <HI>some</HI> times, to perform <HI>eminent</HI> ones.</P>
<P>ALLOW me to direct your attention, in a very particular manner, to a momentous part, which, by this constitution, every citizen will frequently be call∣ed to act. All those, in places of power and trust, will be elected, either immediately by the people, or in such a manner that their appointment will depend ultimately on such immediate election. All the <HI>derivative</HI> movements of government must spring from the <HI>original</HI> movement of the <HI>people at large.</HI> If, to <HI>this,</HI> they give a sufficient force, and a just direction, all the others will be govern∣ed by its controlling power. To speak without a metaphor; if the people, at their elections, take care to choose none but representatives that are <HI>wise</HI> and <HI>good,</HI> their representatives will take care, in their turn, to choose or appoint none but such as are <HI>wise</HI> and <HI>good</HI> also. The remark applies to every succeeding election and appointment. Thus
<PB N="415" REF="024407_0793_0FC6F74EA9A98318"/>
the characters proper for public officers will be dif∣fused from the <HI>immediate elections</HI> of the people o∣ver the remotest parts of administration. Of what immense consequence is it, then, that this <HI>primary</HI> duty should be faithfully and skilfully discharged? On the faithful discharge of it, the public happi∣ness or infelicity under this, and every other con∣stitution, must, in a very great measure, depend. For, believe me, no government, even the best, can be happily administered by <HI>ignorant</HI> or <HI>vicious</HI> men. You will forgive me, I am sure, for endea∣vouring to impress upon your minds, in the strong∣est manner, the importance of this great duty. It is the first <HI>concoction</HI> in politics; and if an er∣ror is committed <HI>here,</HI> it can never be corrected in any subsequent <HI>process,</HI> the certain consequence must be <HI>disease.</HI> Let no one say, that he is but a <HI>single</HI> citizen, and that his ticket will be but <HI>one</HI> in the box; that <HI>one</HI> ticket may <HI>turn</HI> the election. In battle, every soldier should consider the public safety as depending on his <HI>single</HI> arm; at an elec∣tion, every citizen should consider the public hap∣piness as depending on his <HI>single</HI> vote.</P>
<P><HI>A progressive state</HI> is necessary to the happiness and perfection of man. Whatever attainments are already reached, attainments still higher should
<PB N="416" REF="024407_0794_0FC6F7594C0FA580"/>
be pursued. Let us therefore strive with noble emulation. Let us suppose we have done nothing while any thing yet remains to be done. Let us, with fervent zeal, press forward, and make unceas∣ing advances in every thing that can <HI>support, im∣prove, refine,</HI> or <HI>embellish</HI> society.</P>
<P>TO enter into particulars under each of these heads, and to dilate them according to their im∣portance, would be improper at this time. A few remarks on the <HI>last</HI> of them will be congenial with the entertainments of this auspicious day.</P>
<P>IF we give the slightest attention to <HI>nature,</HI> we shall discover, that with <HI>utility</HI> she is curious to blend <HI>ornament.</HI> Can we imitate a better pattern? Public exhibitions have been the favourite amuse∣ments of some of the wisest and most accomplished nations. <HI>Greece,</HI> in her most shining aera, consi∣dered <HI>games</HI> as far from being the least respectable amongst her public establishments. The shews of the <HI>circus</HI> evince that, on this subject, the senti∣ments of <HI>Greece</HI> were fortified by those of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>PUBLIC processions may be so planned and exe∣cuted, as to join <HI>both</HI> the properties of nature's rule. They may <HI>instruct</HI> and <HI>improve,</HI> while they <HI>entertain</HI>
<PB N="417" REF="024407_0795_0FC6F766950C9490"/>
and <HI>please.</HI> They may point out the elegance or usefulness of the sciences and the arts. They may preserve the memory, and engrave the importance of great <HI>political events.</HI> They may represent, with peculiar felicity and force, the operation and effects of great <HI>political truths.</HI> The picturesque and splendid decorations around me, furnish the most beautiful and most brilliant proofs, that these remarks are far from being <HI>imaginary.</HI></P>
<P>THE commencement of our government has been eminently glorious; let our progress in eve∣ry excellence be proportionably great—it will— it must be so. What an enrapturing prospect opens on the United States! Placid <HI>husbandry</HI> walks in front, attended by the <HI>venerable</HI> PLOUGH—low∣ing herds adorn our vallies—bleating flocks spread over our hills—verdant meadows, ena∣melled pastures, yellow harvests, bending or∣chards, rise in rapid succession from east to west: <HI>Plenty,</HI> with her copious horn, sits easy, smiling, and in conscious complacency, enjoys and presides over the scenes: <HI>Commerce</HI> next advances in all her splendid and embellished forms. The rivers and lakes, and seas, are crouded with ships: their shores are covered with cities: the cities are filled with inhabitants: the <HI>arts</HI> decked with elegance,
<PB N="418" REF="024407_0796_0FC6F769B83AE9A8"/>
yet with simplicity, appear in beautiful variety, and well adjusted arrangement. Around them are diffused, in rich abundance, the <HI>necessaries,</HI> the <HI>de∣cencies,</HI> and the <HI>ornaments</HI> of life. With heartfelt contentment, <HI>Industry</HI> beholds his honest labours flourishing and secure. <HI>Peace</HI> walks serene and unalarmed over all the unmolested regions; while <HI>liberty, virtue,</HI> and <HI>religion</HI> go hand in hand, har∣moniously <HI>protecting, enlivening,</HI> and <HI>exalting</HI> all— Happy country! MAY THY HAPPINESS BE PER∣PETUAL!"</P>
<P>AFTER, the oration, the several light companies vere drawn off by captain Heysham, to an emi∣nence, and fired a feu-de-joie of three rounds, and then the company went to dinner. No spirit or wine of any kind were introduced: American por∣ter, beer, and cyder, were the only liquors; and of these the supplies were very abundant. The whole inner circumference of the circle of tables was lined with hogsheads, butts, and barrels of these liquors on tap. The following toasts were drank, announced by trumpets, and answered by the artillery—a round of ten to each toast—and these were again answered by cannon from the ship <HI>Rising Sun,</HI> at her moorings in the river.</P>

<P>It should not be omitted in this account, that the several trades furnished the devices, mottos, machines, and decorations themselves, and at the expence of their respective companies. And that nearly the whole of the work exhibited on that day, was completed between Monday mor∣ning and the Thursday evening following.</P>
<P><PB N="420" REF="024407_0798_0FC6F77546D07220"/>THE military in general, horse, artillery, and infantry were completely dressed, and accoutred, according to the uniform of their respective corps, and made a most martial appearance; being distri∣buted in various parts of the line, they gave a beautiful variety to the whole, and evinced that both soldiers and citizens united in favour of the new government.</P>
<P>THE whole of this vast body was formed, and the entertainment of the day conducted, with a re∣gularity and decorum far beyond all reasonable ex∣pectation. The foot-ways, the windows, and the roofs of the houses were crouded with spectators, exhibiting a spectacle truly magnificent and irresist∣tibly animating. But what was most pleasing to to the contemplative mind, <HI>universal love</HI> and <HI>har∣mony</HI> prevailed, and every countenance appeared to be the index of a heart glowing with urbanity and rational joy. This social idea was much en∣forced by a circumstance, which, probably, never before occurred in such extent, viz. The clergy of almost every denomination united in charity and brotherly love. May they and their flocks so walk through life!</P>
<P><PB N="421" REF="024407_0799_0FC6F7766CF42DC0"/>IT is impossible to be precise in numbers on such an occasion; but averaging several opinions, there were about 5,000 in the line of procession, and about 17,000 on <HI>union</HI> Greeen. The green was entirely cleared by six o'clock in the evening; and the edifice, ship, and several machines, being withdrawn, the citizens soberly retired to their re∣spective homes. The weather was remarkably fa∣vourable for the season; cloudy without rain, and a brisk wind from the south during the whole day. At night, the ship <HI>Rising Sun</HI> was handsomely illu∣minated in honour of this great festival.</P>
<P>SUCH is the account we have been enabled to give of this memorable exhibition. It is very pro∣bable there may be some omissions; if so, the com∣mittee can only assure their fellow citizens, that no neglect or offence was intended to any individual or company whatever. The shortness of the time, and the complicated nature of the task, must be their apology.</P>
<P>AS the system of government now fully ratified, has been the occasion of much <HI>present</HI> joy; so,

<DIV2 TYPE="judgment">
<HEAD>[A. D. 1779.] TUCKER, QUI TAM versus THE SHIP POLE.</HEAD>
<P>THE ship Pole sailed from Liverpool, in Eng∣land, with a cargo of goods for the city of New York in America, then in the possession of the British troops, under a commission of letters of marque and reprisal against the subjects of the United States; and with orders from her owners to cruize against the Americans in her voyage,
<PB N="2" REF="024407_0807_0FC72FB101B06368"/>
being properly armed for that purpose. After the delivery of her cargo at New York, she was to sail for Jamaica, take in a lading of rum and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣gars, and then return to Liverpool.</P>
<P>SUCH was the plan of the voyage; subjected, however, to the discretion of an agent at New York, who had power to alter it if he should think proper.</P>
<P>AFTER the ship had delivered her cargo at New York, the agent ordered her to cruize on the American coast for four months, and shipped hands on board her for the purpose, as <HI>privateer's-men,</HI> which appeared by an endorsement on the ship's articles. She had also a let-pass on board, signed by the senior naval officer at New York, stiling her a privateer.</P>
<P>UNDER these circumstances the <HI>Pole</HI> sailed from New York, and was captured by Tucker, in a fri∣gate belonging to the United States, and libelled against in the admiralty of Pennsylvania as prize: whereupon a claim was filed in behalf of the Unit∣ed States for one half of the value, under an ordi∣nance of congress, passed October 30<SUP>th</SUP> 1776, which gives the whole of vessels of war taken by the ships of the United States to the captors, but re∣serves
<PB N="3" REF="024407_0808_0FC72FB4CED1BB50"/>
one half of merchantmen so taken, to the states.</P>
<P>THE only question was, whether the ship <HI>Pole,</HI> at the time of her being captured, should be consi∣dered as an armed merchantman, or a privateer belonging to the enemy.</P>
<P><HI>VERDICT</HI> in favour of the captors for the whole.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="judgment">
<HEAD>TUCKER, QUI TAM versus THE SLOOP WILLIAM.</HEAD>
<P>THE sloop William, captain Ashburner, was the property of John Wallace, an inhabitant of the island of St. Croix, and a subject of the king of Denmark. She took in a part of her la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng at St. Croix, and cleared out at the custom-house there for the port of Philadelphia. From St.
<PB N="4" REF="024407_0809_0FC72FB74B84B330"/>
Croix she went to Tortola, a British island, where she took in the remainder of her cargo, which, by the testimony, appeared to have been sent after her in a droger from St. Croix. At Tortola, captain Ashburner, who was part owner of the cargo, cleared out at the custom-house there for New York, then in possession of the British troops.</P>
<P>WITH these double clearances, she arrived on the American coast, where captain Tucker disco∣vered, pursued, and boarded her under British co∣lours. Ashburner mistaking Tucker for a British officer, exhibited his Tortola papers, and alledged that he was bound for New York, whereupon Tucker took the sloop as prize, brought her to Philadelphia, and libelled against her in the ad∣miralty as prize; at the same time a claim was filed in behalf of Wallace and Ashburner, the owners.</P>
<P>ON the trial, it was urged, in favour of the claimants, that this vessel and cargo were wholly Danish property, and that, notwithstanding the Tortola clearance, the sloop was in fact bound for Philadelphia, which clearance was only intended as a cover from British capture. In proof of this, many letters were exhibited, found on board, to sundry merchants of the United States. In parti∣cular, one to John Willcox of Philadelphia, con∣taining
<PB N="5" REF="024407_0810_0FC72FBB9FA62088"/>
invoices of the cargo, and consigning the whole to him, informing him also that the vessel was covered with a British clearance.</P>
<P>IT was further shewn, that from the course of the wind, and the direction in which she was sail∣ing at the time she was discovered, the probability was, that she intended for the Delaware.</P>
<P><HI>VERDICT</HI> for the claimants.</P>
<P>N. B. This was previous to the ordinance of congress making double papers condemnation.</P>

<HEAD>BOYD AND CARTER versus THE SCHOONER JEMIMA.</HEAD>
<P>THE schooner Jemima, belonging to Robert Bridges of Philadelphia, was taken by the British
<PB N="6" REF="024407_0811_0FC72FBDE5B899D8"/>
as she lay aground in a creek near to Borden-town, in New Jersey, who stripped her, and then set her on fire. The libellants claimed salvage, for that they, at considerable risk (the enemy be-yet in sight) went on board, extinguished the fire, and saved the vessel.</P>
<P><HI>VERDICT,</HI> in favour of the libellants, for one-half of the value of the schooner.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="judgment">
<HEAD>HOUSTON versus THE BRIG CHARMING NANCY.</HEAD>
<P>THE brig charming Nancy, belonging to Pur∣viance, and others, subjects of the United States, was on her voyage from Senepuxent to Philadel∣phia, when she was discovered near the Capes of Delaware by Houston, in a Philadelphia priva∣teer, then out at sea. Houston hoisted British

colours, and endeavoured to come up with her▪ whereupon, M'Kenzie, captain of the Charming Nancy, taking Houston for an enemy, endea∣voured to run his vessel on shore; but being una∣ble to effect this in time, he, with the whole of his crew, took to their boat, and rowed to land, not leaving a soul on board the brig. M'Kenzie soon after discovered his mistake, went on board his vessel again with his mariners, and brought her up to Philadelphia. And now Houston libelled for salvage, as having found the vessel abandoned on the high seas, and saved her to her owners.</P>
<P>But as the abandomment was occasioned by the libellant's own act, the bill was dismissed.</P>
<P><HI>VERDICT,</HI> that the brig be restored wholly to her owners.</P>

<HEAD>HALESKAMP, versus THE SWIFT's BOAT, AND THREE NEGROES.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Swift,</HI> a British sloop of war, chased the <HI>Rattlesnake,</HI> an American privateer, till, in the heat of the action and chase, both vessels ran a∣shore on the coast of Virginia, and stranded: the captain of the Swift then surrendered to the Rat∣tlesnake. The negroes in question were taken on board the Swift. M'Cullough, commander of the Rattlesnake, took possession of his prize, and em∣ployed the negroes for some time in saving goods from both wrecks: but the negroes, watching a favourable opportunity, took the Swift's boat and went off, intending for New York. Haleskamp saw them from the shore, pursued, and took them, and now libelled against the boat and negroes as his prize.</P>
<P>AND it was urged, in behalf of the libellant, that the property, not having been condemned in
<PB N="9" REF="024407_0814_0FC72FC7C9204DC0"/>
a court of admiralty, vested with M'Cullough on∣ly as a possessory right, which ceased the moment an escape could be effected, and therefore the li∣bellant ought to be considered as an original captor.</P>
<P>BUT the judge was of opinion, that M'Cul∣lough had by the capture acquired a right, <HI>sub judice,</HI> which could not be injured by a fellow sub∣ject, and which a court of justice alone could con∣firm or invalidate: that if Haleskamp had libelled for salvage only, it had been good; but not as prize.</P>
<P><HI>VERDICT</HI>—that the libel be dismissed.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="judgment">
<HEAD>YOUNG, versus THE SLOOP HAERLEM.</HEAD>
<P>SHAW, and others, of the city of New York, subjects of the United States, were owners of the
<PB N="10" REF="024407_0815_0FC72FCA0B4525A8"/>
privateer sloop Harlequin (now called the Haer∣lem.) In September 1776, the British then in∣vading New York, this sloop was, by order of <HI>General Washington,</HI> stationed in Haerlem river to defend that pass, and prevent the enemy's boats from going up the river. On the retreat of <HI>General Washington</HI> with his troops, the own∣ers not being able to get their vessel out to sea, on account of the enemy, had her scuttled and sunk in Haerlem river, where she was stationed, and then fled. The British troops took possession of New York, and afterwards, by order of admiral Howe, this vessel was raised, was called the Haer∣lem, and sitted out as a cruiser in the British ser∣vice. After cruising three years against the Ame∣ricans, and taking many prizes, she was at last captured by the libellants. Whereupon the for∣mer owners claimed her as their property; offer∣ing to pay one half of her value for salvage, as having been more than 96 hours in the enemy's possession, when she was re-captured: alledging, that their property had not entirely divested; be∣cause there was no proof that she had ever been condemned as prize in the British court of admi∣ralty.</P>
<P>BUT although there was indeed no direct proof of such condemnation, yet the length of time she
<PB N="11" REF="024407_0816_0FC72FCE3B6CB138"/>
was in the service of the enemy, together with the general tendency of the testimony produced, gave a strong presumption that she had been so condemned, and therefore the jury found a</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="judgment">
<HEAD>GAMBLE versus THE SLOOP TERRIBLE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Claim, by <HI>John Osman,</HI> for five hogsheads of rum, and a share of the prize.</HEAD>
<P>OSMAN was a prisoner in Jamaica, where also he had money due to him. With this money he purchased five hogsheads of rum. He was then, with other prisoners of war, put on board this sloop, which was British property, to be conveyed to New York, and was permitted to take his five
<PB N="12" REF="024407_0817_0FC72FD3B3F27640"/>
hogsheads of rum along with him on his own ac∣count. The prisoners rose at sea upon the captain and crew, took possession of the sloop, and brought her into the port of Philadelphia. <HI>Osman</HI> was privy to the design, but unable to assist personally in the capture, being confined in bed by his wounds.</P>
<P><HI>VERDICT,</HI> that the sloop be condemned as prize, and that <HI>Osman</HI> have his five hogsheads of rum, together with a distributive share of the prize.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="judgment">
<HEAD>FALLIAGE, &amp; ALI. versus THE SCHOONER HOPE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Mollineaux, &amp; ali. Claimants.</HEAD>
<P>MOLLINEAUX, <HI>and others,</HI> Frenchmen, were owners of the schooner Hope, which was
<PB N="13" REF="024407_0818_0FC72FD65B287420"/>
captured by a British privateer in her voyage from Maryland to France. Falliage, and others, the former crew, but now prisoners on board, contrived to make the British prize-master and his companions very drunk, and to keep them so till the vessel was brought into the port of Philadel∣phia. And now the owners claim their vessel again, on paying salvage, agreeably to the marine laws of America.</P>
<P>BUT it was urged, that they, being French subjects, ought to be determined by the law of France, which gives the whole of re-captured ves∣sels to the re-captor, when the prize has been more than twenty four hours in the possession of the enemy.</P>
<P>BUT the judge was of opinion, that as Ameri∣can owners were, in cases of recapture, allowed the benefit of the American law in the admiralty courts of France, French owners ought also to have the benefit of the American law in the ports of the United States.</P>
<P><HI>VERDICT,</HI> that the schooner be restored to her former owners, they paying to the re-captors one-half of the value in lieu of salvage.</P>

<HEAD>HARRIDAN versus THE SLOOP OF WAR HOPE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Joseph Blewer, et ali. Claimants.</HEAD>
<P>AT the commencement of hostilities between Great Britain and America, the British seized se∣veral merchant vessels in the harbour of Boston, amongst which was the <HI>Hope,</HI> belonging to Blew∣er, and others, of Philadelphia. The British af∣terwards fitted her out as a sloop of war, and put her under royal commission; and she cruised a∣gainst the vessels of the United States for four years, and was at last captured by the libellant.</P>
<P>THE claimants insisted, that this vessel had ne∣ver been condemned as prize in a British court of admiralty; because, at the time she was seized at Boston, no letters of marque and reprisal had as
<PB N="15" REF="024407_0820_0FC72FD980168988"/>
yet issued against the United States, nor had the British courts of admiralty been established in Ame∣rica for the condemnation of their vessels: and thereupon they claimed their vessel, on paying sal∣vage according to the ordinance of congress of December 5<SUP>th</SUP> 1775.</P>
<P><HI>VERDICT</HI> for the claimants, as to the vessel, her tackle, apparel, and furniture (except the guns and warlike stores which were condemned as prize) the said claimants paying one-half of the value to the libellant for salvage.</P>

<PB N="16" REF="024407_0821_0FC72FDB0164B080"/>
<HEAD>RICE versus TAYLOR.</HEAD>
<P>THE parties were commanders of privateers duly commissioned. Taylor engaged, and took a prize, Rice being in sight at the time of the cap∣ture. Whereupon Rice claimed a share of booty under the maritime law.</P>
<P>ON the trial it appeared, that although Rice was in sight at the time of the action, yet from the pe∣culiarity of his situation, it was impossible he should have contributed to the capture by terrifying the enemy: and so the jury found a special verdict in these words.</P>
<P><Q>THAT captain John Rice was in sight, and at the distance of five or six miles at the time of
<PB N="17" REF="024407_0822_0FC72FE32D09CCE8"/>
the said capture, mentioned, and so forth; but that he did not contribute to the said capture, or influence her surrender to the said captain Taylor. And if upon this finding, &amp;c. &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>THE fact was, that Rice lay within a bar, close upon the shore of New Jersey, and saw Taylor engage a British vessel, about five or six miles out at sea. There were also two British vessels of force between Rice and Taylor, at the time of the ac∣tion. Rice, observing the battle, saw at last one of the vessels strike to the other, but could not clearly discern which had the victory: believing that Taylor had surrendered, he reported in Jer∣sey that poor Taylor was taken at last. But he found a few days afterwards, that Taylor had been successful, and brought his prize safe into port. Whereupon he claimed a share of the booty under the general law reflecting vessels in sight of a capture.</P>
<P>IN the argument on the special verdict, the coun∣sel for Rice rested his claim principally on Mol∣loy, Book 1<SUP>st</SUP> chap. 2. sect. 20. urging that no tes∣timony should be admitted against a presumption of law.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="024407_0823_0FC72FE4CBF6CA38"/>BUT the judge observed, that the presumption of law is founded on a material fact: to wit, that the vessel in sight be armed and <HI>prepared for battle,</HI> or at least in a possible condition to join in the bat∣tle. When this is the case, the law will presume that her presence terrified the enemy and influ∣enced the surrender; and therefore, although she does not join in the engagement, allows her a share of the prize in proportion to her men and guns. But if a vessel in sight is aground on ashoal or bar, or is far to leeward, with disabled masts and rigging, or is so situated (as in the present case) that it is manifestly impossible for her to take any part in the battle, she cannot be considered as to be so <HI>prepared for battle</HI> as to bring her with∣in the presumption of law.</P>
<P><Q>WHEN the reason of the law ceases, the law itself ought likewise to cease with it.</Q>
1<SUP>ss</SUP> Black. p. 61.</P>
<P>AND so Rice's claim was dismissed.</P>
<P>THERE was an appeal from this decision, but the appeal was not prosecuted.</P>

<HEAD>GEDDES versus THE GOLDEN ROSE.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Golden Rose,</HI> belonging to subjects of the States of Holland, sailed from Hamburgh with a cargo consigned to Colloghan and Sons, merchants, in the island of Teneriff, an island belonging to the crown of Spain.</P>
<P>HOLLAND was at this time in a state neutrali∣ty, but Britain had declared war against Spain, and neither of these nations were in alliance with the United States of America.</P>
<P>THE Golden Rose was captured near the Island of Teneriff by a British privateer, and ordered for New York, then in possession of the British army, and on her way to New York she was re∣taken
<PB N="20" REF="024407_0825_0FC72FECC740DB78"/>
by the libellant and brought into the port of Philadelphia.</P>
<P>HASSENCLEVER filed a claim for the ship and cargo in behalf of the owners and merchants, sub∣jects of the states of Holland, and</P>
<P>DON Juan de Miralles also filed a claim for the cargo only, in behalf of Colloghan and Sons, sub∣jects of the king of Spain.</P>
<P>IT was argued for the libellant, that although the ship and cargo did originally belong to the subjects of neutral powers with respect to America, yet the property had totally divested by the British capture, the vessel having been more than than six weeks in their possession: that if any injury was done to the neutral owners, it was done by the Bri∣tish captain who first took her, and not by the li∣bellant, who forced her from a declared enemy as he had a right to do: that the present case came within the resolve of congress of November, 1775, declaring that all vessels employed in trans∣porting provisions, stores, and so forth, to the ene∣my in New York, should, if taken, be lawful prize. And lastly, that if this vessel should not be condemned as prize, it would be easy for subjects of neutral nations to supply the British at New
<PB N="21" REF="024407_0826_0FC72FEE049B5A10"/>

<P>ON the contrary, it was urged for the claimants, that this ship had committed no offence whatever, that her intended voyage was a lawful one, viz. from Hamburgh to Teneriff. And although the libellant took her in her way to New York, yet it was by compulsion that she was found in that course. that the British privateer had violated the laws of nations in taking her, and therefore she could not have been condemned in their courts of ad∣miralty; inferring, that as she was not legal prize to the captors, the re-captors could have no better title: and that, supposing the cargo to be Spanish property, yet as it had not been condemned to the captors, the property had not been totally di∣vested, but that the <HI>jus postliminii</HI> took place, a∣greeably to the ordinance of congress of Decem∣ber 5. 1775.</P>
<P>AFTER long argument, the judge instructed the jury, that as the facts were all acceded to in this cause, viz. That the ship was Dutch, and the cargo Spanish property, and that she had been ta∣ken and retaken, as set forth in the libel, the deci∣sion must depend upon points of law only, and therefore recommended their bringing in a special

<HEAD>(1780.) MONTGOMERY vesus. WHARTON, AND OTHERS, OWNERS OF THE SHIP GENERAL GREENE.</HEAD>
<P>WHARTON, and others, owners of the ship General Greene, had chartered her to certain mer∣chants for a particular voyage, and appointed Montgomery master for that voyage. The ship had cleared out at the naval office, and was on the point of sailing, when a sudden frost filled the Delaware with ice, and fixed her in the port of Philadelphia. During the winter some differen∣ces
<PB N="25" REF="024407_0830_0FC72FFA7B519F88"/>
arose between the owners and master. The consequence of which was that the owners by a letter of dismission, discharged Montgomery from their service, and put another master on board. Whereupon Montgomery libelled against the ow∣ners in the admiralty to compell them to fulfil their contract with him.</P>
<P>THE question was, whether owners could dis∣miss the master they had appointed before the completion of the voyage, after he had signed bills of lading for the cargo, and shipped his ma∣riner, without the owners shewing sufficient cause for such dismission.</P>
<P>AND it was contended, that the master, from the time of his appointment, has the sole com∣mand of the ship vested in him, and cannot be dis∣placed without committing some offence sufficient to forfeit his rights and justify a dismission. That after signing bills of lading, he becomes an∣swerable to the freighters for the delivery of the cargo, and that the owners cannot by their act exo∣nerate him from this charge, whilst the bills of la∣ding signed with his hand, remain in the possession of the freighters: that the libellant, considering himself as engaged for this voyage, had neglected to seek for any other appointment; and that the
<PB N="26" REF="024407_0831_0FC72FFE2ED54DB8"/>
owners discharging him at this time, was an inju∣ry which the court ought in justice to redress by compelling them to reinstate him in his office.</P>
<P>IN behalf of the respondents it was urged, that the owners of a ship have, and ought to have, a right to remove the master at pleasure; because their interests are so deeply concerned in the ap∣pointment, that they are answerable not only for his imprudent conduct, but are bound by con∣tracts he may legally make on account of the con∣cern: that if, after their their choice or a master, his appointment should be deemed irrevocable for the voyage, unless some gross offence can be proved, the owners will be at the mercy of the master, who, by his weak or wicked conduct, may bring them to ruin. That if when the owners have dismissed the master, the court should undertake to reinstate him, contrary to their judgment and inclination, and so force him upon them, the court and not the owners, ought to be answerable to the freigh∣ters for any consequences that may ensue: that neither the charter-party, shipping articles, or bills of lading, prohibit a change of the ma∣ster, as the contracts made with him are made in his official and not in his personal capa∣city: that the master is in fact the representa∣tive of the owners, and not himself personally
<PB N="27" REF="024407_0832_0FC73000E35C6DE0"/>
bound, neither is he answerable for the conduct of his successor: that in case an action should be brought against him for a breach of contract on the bills of lading, he might plead his dismission by the owners, and it would be good in law: that the subordinate officers are appointed by the master of a ship, and if they should misbehave, or prove insufficient or unsafe, the owners have no remedy but by the removal of the master: that if owners are bound by the appointment of a ma∣ster to continue him for the voyage, the master ought also to be bound to perform the voyage, even against his interest or inclination; but if, in case of the master's refusal, the owners should li∣bel against him in the admiralty, the court could give no redress, because the court cannot award damages, neither can it compel the master to a spe∣cific performance of his contract, from the nature of the service: that the master's appointment is, and ought to be during pleasure only: that the same pow∣er which appoints can remove: that if a master suffers injury by an unreasonable dismission, he may have his remedy at common law, where ample recompence in damages will be made to him: and finally, that whatever inconveniences may arise to masters being subjected to the caprice of owners
<PB N="28" REF="024407_0833_0FC73002097A6440"/>
of vessels, much greater would arise to the ow∣ners, should they be compelled to retain in their service masters once appointed, however con∣trary to their judgment or interest; and that no instance can be produced of a master being thus forced upon the owners of a ship by any court whatever.</P>
<P>TO which, council for the libellant replied— That this cause came properly before the court of admiralty: that where a court hath the right to take cognizance of an injury, it follows necessarily that it can give redress: that if the court cannot award damages, it can order a specific performance of the contract: that the court can compel the master to such performance; and if he refuses, can attach his person, and oblige him to give se∣curity for the completion of his contract; and, therefore, the jurisdiction is competent: that it would be unjust to send the master to common law for redress, on the owner's breach of contract, as the owners may fail and be unable to pay dama∣ges, and therefore the ship ought to be his certain and proper security: that all contracts ought to be sacred and mutual, being founded on reciprocity; and it would be absurd to alledge, that the master is bound on his part, and the owners not bound on theirs: that a master engaged for a voyage, is
<PB N="29" REF="024407_0834_0FC73004A5420E30"/>
like a servant indented for a certain time; and that the engagement or indenture cannot be dissolved, during the terms, but by mutual consent: that this vessel was chartered to the freighter, who acquired by the charter-party a temporary property in her, and the owners had nothing to do with her for the time, the ship being under the same circumstances with a house leased for a term: that after the char∣ter-party is signed, and the goods laden on board, the owners cannot discharge the master at their pleasure; as his good character and abilities might have been the inducement which led the freighter to make choice of that ship in preference: and, lastly, that if no instance can be found of a master's being forced upon the owners of a ship, neither can any authority be produced, giving the owners the arbitrary power of dismissing the master at pleasure, and without assigning sufficient cause.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="judgment">
<HEAD>JUDGMENT.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER having carefully considered the argu∣ments advanced, and the authorities cited in this cause, it appears to me unnecessary to pursue the whole tract of argument that hath been taken on this occasion. The decision of the cause rests sole∣ly on the nature of the contract between the ow∣ners
<PB N="30" REF="024407_0835_0FC73005D80E37E8"/>
of a ship and the captain they employ. And the terms or substance of such a contract is, in my opinion this, viz. If the master well and faithfully performs the duties of his station, the owners, on on their part, are bound to pay the stipulated wa∣ges, and allow him all the customary privileges of his office. But it does not seem to be any part of the contract, that a master once engaged, shall be master for the voyage at all events. This might be extremely injurious to owners, on account of the very extensive powers a master hath over their property. And however hard it may appear that that the master should be subject to the caprice of his owners in this respect, he must consider it as one of the unavoidable inconveniences of his oc∣cupation, and in cases of real injury apply to the laws of his country for redress. Much greater would the danger be to owners of vessels, and in∣deed to commerce in general, if the appointment of a master should be irrevocable for the voyage. Whatever good opinion an owner may have of the master, at the time of his appointment, he may find sufficient reason afterwards to change his mind, and yet not be able to produce legal proof of his defection or inability. Fidelity or infidelity before a service performed, is a matter of opinion only, and it would be an unreasonable hardship to com∣pel
<PB N="31" REF="024407_0836_0FC7300E57466790"/>
an owner to continue what was originally a voluntary trust, in the hands of a person of whom he may have found subsequent reasons to believe that he may prove either unfaithful or unskilful, although he may not be able to charge him with any positive offence: but I cannot see how this court can interfere to any effect. If the court should decree that the owners shall receive the libellant on board, as master for the voyage con∣tracted for; have not the owners a power to sell their ship, to lay her up, or totally change the voyage, and so evade the decree? Or, if a master should refuse to go the voyage for which he en∣gaged, can this court compel a specific performance of the duties of his office? The remedy in both cases must be in damages for a breach of contract, to which the common law is most competent. Let the bill be dismissed.</P>
<P>THE libellant appealed from this judgment, and the cause was again fully argued before the judges of the high court of errors and appeals; but the li∣bel was finally dismissed.</P>

<HEAD>THE GOLDEN ROSE.</HEAD>
<P>THE marshal of the court brought in an account against the ship <HI>Golden Rose,</HI> for sundry expendi∣tures made, and services done for the said ship and her cargo; and prayed the judge to direct what parts of the said account should be charged to the ship, and what to the cargo.</P>
<P>THE judge, after hearing argument thereupon, directed,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That captain Vanderwindt pay for the pi∣lotage of his ship into port; because this expence would have accrued to him, if he had arrived at the port of his destination.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That he also pay all reasonable char∣ges for wharfage and fastenings: because, by the terms of the charter-party, he is to bring his ship to a fit place for unlading, and because those ex∣pences are necessary to the safety of his ship.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That the cargo be charged with all
<PB N="33" REF="024407_0838_0FC7301110FEF7A8"/>
reasonable expences attending the unlading of the ship: because by the fifth article of the charter-party, it is covenanted, that the freighter shall cause the cargo to be brought on board, and at the place of discharge, taken from on board, free of char∣ges.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> That the expence of cutting the ship out of the ice be borne by the ship and cargo, in equal proportions, provided the cargo was on board when this service was done—otherwise, by the ship only: because this was equally necessary for the preservation of both.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> That the marshal's bill for keeping watch on board, whilst the property was in his possession, as also the court charges, or costs of suit, be charged to the cargo: because the ship on the trial was fully acquitted.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> Wherever a charge is allotted in the above apportionment to be paid by the cargo, it is to be understood that the libellants are to pay one half thereof, and Colloghan and Sons, or their agents, the other half: because those charges are supposed to be deducted from the whole cargo be∣fore distribution made between the libellants and claimants, according to the decree.</P>

<HEAD>DUCATUR. versus THE BRIG NYMPH.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Claim by Thomas Irwin &amp; al.</HEAD>
<P>IT appeared in testimony that the Brig Nymph (formerly called the Neptune), had been the pro∣perty of the claimants, and was captured by the British ship <HI>Iris</HI> on the 22<SUP>nd</SUP> or 23<SUP>d</SUP> of April 1780: that on the 21<SUP>st</SUP>, and 22<SUP>nd</SUP> of the same month, three other vessels were also taken by the same ship, all which prizes were sent into New York: that on the 28<SUP>th</SUP> of the same month the captains of these four prizes were all taken before the judge of ad∣miralty there, and examined, preparatory to the trial and condemnation of their vessels: that, a∣bout a fortnight after, one of the said four cap∣tains
<PB N="35" REF="024407_0840_0FC7301AA2FB8160"/>
was told by some of the officers of the Iris, and also by some of the crew, that they had re∣ceived their shares of the four prizes aforesaid. It was also in proof, that the said four vessels had been advertised for sale at the coffee-house in New York; and one of them, viz. the <HI>Hetty,</HI> was particularly remembered to have been advertised, <HI>as a condemned prize:</HI> that the Neptune had been purchased by merchants in New York; and that on the 13<SUP>th</SUP> of May following she was commissioned as a privateer, by the name of the <HI>Nymph,</HI> to cruise against the vessels of the United States of America. Lastly, it appeared this brig sailed from New York on the 21<SUP>st</SUP> and was captured by the libellant on the 25<SUP>th</SUP> of May.</P>
<P>AGAINST the libel of the captors there was a claim filed, by Thomas Irwin and others, the for∣mer owners, founded on the ordinance of congress of the 5th of December 1775, upon a suggestion that this vessel could not have been condemned in the court of admiralty at New York previous to the re-capture: and in support of this suggestion, a British act of parliament was exhibited, wherein is set forth at large the mode in which the ves∣sels captured from the United States of America shall be proceeded against in their courts of ad∣miralty. Which act directs, that for the more
<PB N="36" REF="024407_0841_0FC7301C45FC7C68"/>
more speedy condemnation of such vessels, the whole process shall be completed in 28 days from the first application made to the judge by the cap∣tors; and the claimants alledged that this brig not only sailed from New York, but was re-cap∣tured by the libellant before the 28 days were accomplished; and therefore inferred, that she could could not have been condemned under this act: that all the evidence produced by the libellant to proved a condemnation was merely hearsay, and ought to have no weight, especially as there was no mention made of any such condemnation amongst the papers found on board, as is usual. And lastly, that her having been sold, commissioned, and sailing, and the money paid for purchasing her, being distributed amongst the first captors (if true) is still no proof, or even presumption, of her con∣demnation; because it is customary for the judge to permit prizes to be sold before trial, the parties giving security; and insisted, that before the property can totally divest, the condemnation must be directly proved, according to the ordi∣nance of December 5th 1775.</P>
<P>WHEREUPON the judge observed,</P>
<P>THAT the manifest spirit of the ordinance of congress of December 5th is truly complied with
<PB N="37" REF="024407_0842_0FC7301DBB5C3678"/>
when the property is fully and fairly divested: that the most direct and decisive way of ascertain∣ing such divesture is by legal condemnation in the enemy's court of admiralty; and therefore the or∣dinance makes that the criterion; but that con∣gress could not expect that full and direct proof of such condemnation could in all cases be produced, as the documents necessary to such proof cannot always be in power of the parties; strong pre∣sumption must therefore often supply the place of absolute proof: that this brig having been captured, taken into the enemy's port, sold by or∣der of the judge, commissioned under a new name, fitted out and sent by new owners on a cruize, must found a violent presumption that she had been legally condemned as lawful prize to the first captors: that whether she had been formal∣ly condemned or not, these circumstances were fully sufficient to a total divesture of the property from the former owners: that the act of parlia∣ment referred to, is professedly designed to shorten the process of the courts of admiralty, and directs that it shall be completed within 28 days; but does not prohibit its being done in a shorter time: that as proofs have been given that some vessels have been condemned in a shorter time, it is possible, and even probable, that this brig might also have
<PB N="38" REF="024407_0843_0FC73022ABFB8198"/>
been so condemned, and that such a presumption is justifiable by all the circumstances of the case.</P>

<HEAD>KEMP versus THE SLOOP SARAH.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Stiles, and others, claimants.</HEAD>
<P>THE Sloop Sarah, being Bermudian property, sailed with a cargo of onions, sugar, salt, gin, flour and oil, from from Bermudas for Charlestown in South Carolina, the owners knowing at the time of her sailing that Charlestown was then in
<PB N="39" REF="024407_0844_0FC730255C4653B8"/>
the possession of the British troops. The libel∣lants discovered and captured her on Charles∣town bar, at the entrance of the harbour, brought her into the port of Philadelphia, and libelled against her as prize.</P>
<P>WHEREUPON a claim was filed in behalf of Stiles, and others, the former owners.</P>
<P>AND it was urged in support of the claim, that by an ordinance of congress of the 24th of July 1776, the property of Bermudians was exempted from confiscation: that under the sanction of this ordinance the Bermudians had traded with the Uni∣ted States during the war, and frequently supplied their necessities at a very great hazard: and that Stiles the claimant in particular had been twice ta∣ken prisoner by the British for trading with the subjects of the United States: that the present car∣go was not sent as supplies to the enemy: that the flour on board was too inconsiderable a quanti∣ty to answer any such purpose; and that salt could be imported into Charlestown much more con∣veniently and cheaper from Turks Island than from Bermudas. That the truth is, this cargo was designed in part to discharge a debt due from the claimants to a certain Mr Loyd a known
<PB N="40" REF="024407_0845_0FC73027DC0372A0"/>
friend to the American cause, and now a prisoner in Charlestown, and in part to purchase neces∣saries for the inhabitants of Bermudas: that the ordinance of congress prohibiting any vessels from carrying supplies, &amp;c. to any part of the Uni∣ted States in the possession of the enemy, cannot be supposed to extend to vessels carrying provisions to relieve the wants of the subjects of those states who are prisoners and in distress, for that such an extension would be contrary to reason, humanity, and good policy. Testimony was also produced to prove, that there was really a debt due from the claimants to Mr Loyd at Charlestown; and that the owners, or some of them, had declared before the vessel sailed from Bermudas, that part of the cargo was to discharge the debt due to Mr. Loyd, and the remainder to purchase provisions.</P>
<P>THE arguments being closed, the judge ob∣served,</P>
<P>THAT the ordinance of congress in favour of the inhabitants of Bermudas, a people under the sovereignty and allegiance of Great Britain, could never be intended to put them on a better foot∣ing with respect to the war, than the citizens of America, or the citizens of neutral powers; and that there could be but little doubt, but that an
<PB N="41" REF="024407_0846_0FC7302937B91360"/>
American vessel, taken in the situation of the brig Sarah, would have been confiscated: that the plea, that she was carrying supplies to a prisoner, ought to have been supported by full and direct testimony, to counteract the violent presumption to the contrary; but here was no direct testimony to that point, and even supposing the suggestion to be true, as to the good intentions of the claimants, they had not conducted the business according to the known rules of war; for leave should have been first obtained from the British commander at Charlestown, even for Bermu∣dians to send in supplies to his prisoners. It is indeed in proof, that there is a debt due from the claimants to Mr. Loyd, a prisoner in Charlestown; and that one of the owners was heard to say, that part of this cargo was to discharge that debt, and the remainder to purchase provisions: but it no where appears, what was the amount of this debt, a very necessary circumstance, if all other objections were out of the way; otherwise, un∣der cover of small and trifling debts due to pri∣soners, large and important supplies might be in∣troduced to the enemy; and at any rate, the plea of paying a debt due could extend no further than the amount of that debt. But in opposition to these appearances of good intentions, it is in proof, that the owners originally designed this vessel and
<PB N="42" REF="024407_0847_0FC7302B92A3AAE0"/>
cargo for the West India Islands, but changed the voyage as soon as it was known that Charlestown had surrendered to the enemy.</P>
<P>I adjudge that this vessel and cargo be con∣demned as prize to the libellants, and that the claim be dismissed</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="judgment">
<HEAD>WALKER versus THE ALBION.</HEAD>
<P>THIS ship was taken on her way from Liver∣pool to Archangel, having on board a cargo of salt and a hogshead of rum. The captors sent in with the prize, the ship's gunner, and three lads, prisoners; also two custom-house cockets, and an im∣perfect logbook or journal, said to be all the papers
<PB N="43" REF="024407_0848_0FC73030981519A0"/>
found on board at the time she was taken. One of these cockets respected the salt on board, and the other, the rum. The prize-master swore that there were no other papers found in the ship; and the gunner deposed, that the vessel was the pro∣perty of <HI>Ormson and Son,</HI> merchants in Liverpool, but that the salt and rum were shipped by a con∣sul from the court of Russia, at Liverpool, on ac∣count of the empress of Russia.</P>
<P>ON this appearance of the cargo's being neu∣tral property, the judge directed the attorney gene∣ral to file and prosecute a claim for the said cargo in behalf of the her majesty Russia.</P>
<P>THE cause being fully argued, the judge declared himself as follows:</P>
<P>IT is not essential to the present enquiry, whether it is probable or not, that there is at Liverpool such a character as a consul from the court of Russia, or what the rights and privileges of a consul are, by the law of nations; subjects which have perhaps been too largely discussed in the course of this ar∣gument. The only question seems to be, Is there sufficient proof or not that this cargo was shipped on account of her majesty of Russia, by her fac∣tor
<PB N="44" REF="024407_0849_0FC730337AC0D520"/>
or agent at Liverpool? or, in other words, I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the cargo neutral property or not?</P>
<P>THE testimony, by which this question is to be determined, stands thus: On the one side are the custom-house cockets of Liverpool, certifying the salt to have been shipped by Messrs. <HI>Gilbert and company,</HI> merchants, of Liverpool, and the rum to have been shipped by a Mr. <HI>Roe,</HI> of the same place. On the other side we have the deposition of the gunner of the ship, who belonged to her, as he says, at the time she was taking in her lading at Liverpool; and expressly swears, that both the salt and rum were shipped by a Russian consul at Liverpool, on account of the empress; and gives several collateral circumstances to support the truth of his allegation.</P>
<P>IT has been suggested on the part of the claim∣ant, that custom-house papers are often fallacious, and not conclusive evidence: that, for various mercantile reasons, borrowed names are often sub∣stituted for the names of the real shippers: that the deposition of the gunner is direct and absolute; and that from the seeming mutilation of the log-book, and the papers forwarded being so few, there is reason to suspect a suppression of evidence on the part of the captors, in order to conceal
<PB N="45" REF="024407_0850_0FC7303500DF05C0"/>
from the court the real proprietor of this cargo; and that this suspicion is further countenanced by the captors not sending forward the captain or mate of the prize, as by his instructions he ought to have done.</P>
<P>HAVING considered, as well these, as the argu∣ments adduced in behalf of the libellants, I am of opinion, That the testimony of the gunner, found∣ed on report only, concerning a matter in which he cannot be supposed to have any certain or ac∣curate knowledge, however honestly or impartial∣ly given, ought not to outweigh the certified de∣claration of regular, official papers, unless some probable proof can be given, or circumstances ad∣duced to shew, that these papers are, or may be, fallacious. There does not, in the present case, appear any reason, why a Russian factor or agent should make use of the names of Liverpool mer∣chants to cover his neutral property, which would have been secure from confiscation without any such artifice: that a British merchant should, in the present war, strive to conceal his property un∣der a neutral name is a very natural suggestion; but common sense will not allow the supposition, that a neutral owner, already secure, would risk pro∣perty under the borrowed names of persons, whose names alone would endanger confiscation in case
<PB N="46" REF="024407_0851_0FC7303A304613F8"/>
of capture. The condition of the papers, and the not sending forward the captain or mate of the prize, induce a censure of negligence on the part of the captors; but a wilful suppression of evidence for the evasion of justice, is a crime of so heinous a nature, that it ought not to be presumed of any one, unless very powerful circumstances shall jus∣tify the presumption.</P>
<P>I adjuge, that the ship Albion and her cargo, be condemned as lawful prize to the libellants.</P>

In the one, the prize was a wreck, stranded on the shore, and great part of the booty was taken on shore by the crews of vessels not commissioned: in the other, a vessel without a commission, took a prize, and carried her into a foreign port, where the captor sold her, and con∣verted h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> money to his own use.</P>
<P>IN both cases, the booty was taken by persons not commissioned to take; no vessels duly com∣missioned assisting in, or being present at the time of the capture. But in the present case, the prize was in fact taken by vessels regularly authorized
<PB N="49" REF="024407_0854_0FC7303EBB4CE880"/>
for the purpose, and the non-commissioned vessel only in sight at the time of the battle. In the ca∣ses cited, no persons were present or assisting to whom the booty could be legally adjudged. Here the libellants, the real captors, were duly commis∣sioned to take, and empowered by their commissi∣ons, and the resolve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of congress, to possess and enjoy the property so legally taken.</P>
<P>A vessel not commissioned must be considered as a mere merchantman; and according to <HI>Lee,</HI> 237, if a merchant vessel meets an enemy in the course of the voyage, and takes her, the prize shall belong to the captor: but if she goes out of her course to seek plunder, she may be deemed a pi∣rate. Now, it is not pretended that the Livingston. took the prize in question, on the contrary, it is in testimony, that she was running away whilst the libellants were engaged with the enemy; and now claims a share of the prize, as having been in sight at the time of the capture.</P>
<P>THE right under which a vessel in sight may claim a share of a prize taken, is founded in a pre∣sumption of law, which supposes a vessel so in sight, and armed, and prepared for battle, to have indu∣ced a surrender. A presumption of law is a legal indulgence, and ought to be strictly confined within
<PB N="50" REF="024407_0855_0FC73041038DBE88"/>
the reason of the presumption. But no authority has been adduced to shew that this indulgence has been extended to a vessel not commissioned to take, unarmed, and flying from the scene of action.</P>
<P>THE Livingston cannot claim under the pre∣sumption of law, not being within the description; nor the United States under the general doctrine; because the prize was in fact taken by vessels duly authorised to take, which the Livingston was not. I adjudge, therefore, that the claim in this cause be dismissed, and that the brig <HI>Recovery</HI> be con∣demned as prize to the libellants.</P>

<HEAD>YOUNG versus THE SLOOP TWO FRIENDS.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Claim by <HI>Timothy Penny,</HI> for the vessel and part of the cargo; by <HI>Alden Bass,</HI> for a quantity of glass and dry goods; and by <HI>Jerusha Fitch,</HI> for rum and dry goods.</HEAD>
<P><HI>TIMOTHY Penny,</HI> a citizen of the United States of America, having an estate in the island of Ja∣maica,
<PB N="51" REF="024407_0856_0FC730478DC93490"/>
obtained from congress a passport or safe conduct, for one Joseph Dean, to go to Jamaica and purchase a vessel there, which he was to load with "PRODUCE," on Penny's account, and to bring the said vessel and her cargo into any port of the United States not in the possession of the enemy.</P>
<P>IT appears that the sloop in question was so purchased by Dean, and laden in part on Penny's account: that Messrs. <HI>Fitch</HI> and <HI>Tyler,</HI> of Jamai∣ca, being friendly to Dean, and privy to the pur∣pose for which he had purchased the sloop, and the real destination of her voyage, put on board a quantity of rum and dry goods—the former, for the use of his mother, <HI>Jerusha Fitch</HI> and his son re∣ading at Boston; and the latter for his friend <HI>Al∣den Bass,</HI> at Boston, who had charge of his (Tyler's) son: that the sloop, so laden, cleared out at the custom-house in Jamaica for New York, then in the possession of the British troops, and sailed under convoy of a British fleet, as for New York: that when she arrived on the American coast, the cap∣tain made three attempts to run her into Chesapeak Bay, but without success, notwithstanding several manoeuvres to deceive the convoy. At length, being off the capes of Delaware, by slacking sail, under pretence of the mast's being sprung and a
<PB N="52" REF="024407_0857_0FC7304B113FB5E0"/>
supposed leak, the captain dexterously left the fleet in the night, and ran up the Delaware, where his sloop was taken by the libellants.</P>
<P>IT has been admitted on the part of the libel∣lants, that this sloop did really intend for some port in the United States not in the possession of of the enemy, and that the goods were <HI>bona fide</HI> shipped as set forth in the exhibits; and for the purposes alledged. But it is urged, that the safe conduct of congress ought to be strictly constru∣ed—that dry goods are not the <HI>produce</HI> of a Ja∣maica estate, and therefore not covered by the passport: that <HI>Fitz</HI> and <HI>Tyler</HI> are British subjects; and the property of the goods shipped by them not altered by the bills of lading, because those bills do not declare the use, the appropriation be∣ing only designated in private instructions, which, the parties might have revoked at pleasure; and that under these circumstances, being truly British property, they ought to be condemned as prize to the captor.</P>
<P>ON examiming the complexion of this cause, I find that the peculiar circumstances of the case, require that it should be viewed in the liberal light of equity, rather than squared by the strictest rules
<PB N="53" REF="024407_0858_0FC7304D02B80B80"/>
of law. The intention of congress in granting the passport appears to have been to permit Timo∣thy Penny to import the produce of his estate in Jamaica, for the benefit of himself and family; and it is but reasonable to suppose that they meant this should be done in the most beneficial manner. Had it been otherwise, congress would not have vested an important restriction on a single word of equivocal construction; but would have in∣serted a prohibitory clause in the passport. As to the law respecting bills of lading, it seems not to apply fully to the present case, because the whole arrangement of this business was framed with a view to cover the property from seizure by Bri∣tish captors, and not according to the custom of merchants in open commerce. These bills of la∣ding and instructions were altogether confidential.</P>
<P>IT must be allowed, that Fitch and Tyler, resi∣ding in Jamaica, and being professedly British sub∣jects, had no right to ship goods for the United States; and as their part of the cargo is not cove∣red by the passport, they ran great risk of confis∣cation into whatever hands they might fall. If it could be made appear, that these goods were to have been sold for their personal benefit, they would doubtless be prize to the captors. But as it is manifest from the testimony, and admitted
<PB N="54" REF="024407_0859_0FC730537153EE00"/>
by counsel for the libellants, that the goods shipped by Fitch were for the support of his aged mother and his son at Boston, subjects of the United States, and that those shipped by Tyler were for use of his son, under the care of his friend Alden Bass, also American subjects, or to discharge debts already contracted on their accounts, it seems to be one of those cases to which the strictness of law ought not to be rigorously applied—more especially as there is little reason to apprehend that lenity here may form a dangerous precedent for hereafter, because a like case will probably never occur again—passports of this kind being very rare.</P>
<P>LET the libel be dismissed; and the sloop and her cargo be delivered to the claimants. But as there was such probable cause of capture, I adjudge that the claimants pay the costs and charges.</P>

<HEAD>PATRICK MAHOON &amp; AL. versus THE BRIG GLOCESTER.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Libel for prize money.</HEAD>
<P>THE Brig Glocester had been captured by Ro∣ger Kean in the privateer Holker, and condemn∣ed as prize to the captors. The marshal being a∣bout to make distribution of the booty amongst the crew, according to the list handed in by cap∣tain Kean, was notified to stay in his hands 25 shares of the said prize, claimed by Patrick Ma∣hoon, and others, as being a part of the crew belonging to, and concerned in the said privateer Holker. Notwithstanding that their names were not to be found in the captain's return; the libel, now before the court is for these 25 shares.</P>
<P>THE circumstances of this case appear, by the testimony exhibited, to be as follows.</P>
<P>THE printed articles of the privateer Holker were set up at a common house of rendezvous for
<PB N="56" REF="024407_0861_0FC73056BAEAD708"/>
the enlistment of privateer's men, according to cu∣stom. The libellants, in common with many o∣thers, signed these articles, and made the neces∣sary preparations for the cruise. When the Hol∣ker was ready to sail, the libellants, with the rest of the crew, repaired on board by order of the captain, and the vessel set sail. When they arri∣ved at Chester on the Delaware (15 miles below Philadelphia) captain Kean mustered his crew up∣on deck, called over their names as subscribed to the articles, and then, without giving any reason for his conduct, selected Patrick Mahoon and 24 others, and ordered them on shore; refusing to let them proceed on the cruise, and when they ear∣nestly solicited to be continued on board he for∣cibly drove them away, and the captain pro∣ceeded on his voyage, leaving the libellants behind.</P>
<P>A few days after Kean again called his crew to∣gether, and produced to them another printed co∣py of articles, which he urged them to sign. Some objected, observing that they had already signed, and did not understand signing two sets of articles for the same cruise; but the captain enforced them with threats and even blows, to sign the new ar∣ticles; declaring at the same time, that his view
<PB N="57" REF="024407_0862_0FC730594D137538"/>
was to exclude those men whom he had left be∣hind from having any share of the prizes they might take. The Brig Glocester was captured during this cruise.</P>
<P>THE respondents have rested their cause prin∣cipally on a plea to the jurisdiction of this court; alledging that the injury, if any, was exclusively of common law cognizance; because the libel∣lants claim was founded in articles executed on shore, within the body of a country: that although the admiralty could determine the question of prize or no prize; yet it could not determine to whose use, having no jurisdiction in disputes between owner and owner, owner and captain, or captain and mariner, except only in the case of a mariner's wages, which is allowed out of special favour, and not of right, further than as <HI>communis error f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cit jus.</HI></P>
<P>THE facts being fully ascertained, and not con∣troverted, no difficulty arises from that quarter. It is in proof that captain Kean forced the libel∣lants on shore after the voyage was begun, and compelled the remainder of the crew to sign the new articles, with a veiw to exclude the libellants from any advantage they might claim under the
<PB N="58" REF="024407_0863_0FC7305D43E8CF08"/>
former; and it is contended that this court cannot redress the injury, because the suit respects <HI>damages,</HI> which the common law alone can ascertain. The truth however is, that the parties do not sue for redress or an injury; but for their shares of a prize legally condemned to the use <HI>of the owners, officers, and crew, and of all persons belonging to, or concer∣ned in the privateer Holker:</HI> of which crew, they say, they are a part. The articles of enlistment, ex∣ecuted on shore, is no bar to the jurisdiction of the admiralty. Mariners are generally engaged on shore, and always sue for their wages in this court. In the one case the mariners are paid by monthly wages, or by the run, in the other by a share of the booty taken. There is the same reason in both cases. But I am of opinion that the articles are not the true foundation of a seaman's claim. If one or more mariners should enter on board a vessel, with the knowledge and consent of the master, should receive his orders and perform the duties of the staion, they would be entitled to cu∣stomary wages, or a proportion of the booty ta∣ken in common with the rest of the crew, although they had signed no articles at all, the right is not founded in the articles, but in the service.</P>
<P>IT has been said, that this court can only deter∣mine the question <HI>prize or no prize,</HI> but cannot ad∣judge
<PB N="59" REF="024407_0864_0FC7305E76C9A280"/>
<HI>to whose use. Broom's</HI> case in Carth. 399 and 475, is express in point to the contrary. The admiralty not only decreed <HI>lawful prize,</HI> but also to whose use, viz. <HI>to the King's;</HI> and Broom having converted the property to his own use, was sued in the admiralty by the king's proctor for the va∣lue. Broom applied for a prohibition, which was denied; because the court of admiralty, having de∣termined the property to be prize <HI>to the king,</HI> this second suit was deemed to be only a continuation of the original process.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, it cannot be supposed but that du∣ring the many maritime wars in which England hath been engaged, contests about the rights of seamen to shares of prizes must have frequently occur∣red. If then such claims were only triable at common law, they would doubtless appear in some of the books of reports. But no actions of this kind can be found in those books, nor even prohi∣bitions prayed for in such cases. The inference is, that such suits were allowed to be exclusively of admiralty jurisdiction.</P>
<P>IF Captain Kean had any reasonable objections against the libellants, he should have made those objections before he received them on board, or at
<PB N="60" REF="024407_0865_0FC7306132613398"/>
least before the vessel had weighed anchor and commenced her voyage.</P>
<P>AS the libellants were in fact forced from the service, I do not see why this wrong, on the part of the captain, should deprive them of the right they had obtained in this cruise by the enlistment, and by the captain's confirmation of that enlistment when he received them into his service.</P>
<P>I adjudge that the libellants have and receive their respective shares of the prize Brig Gloces∣ter, and her cargo, in common with the rest of the Holker's crew.</P>

<HEAD>PRINGLE AND SHEE vresus THE ELIZABETH.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Claim by Charles Phile.</HEAD>
<P>THE Brig Elizabeth arrived with a cargo of dry goods on the 26th of February 1781 at Glou∣cester, in the river Delaware, from Cork in Ire∣land: being the property of merchants of Cork, subjects of the king of great Britain when there was war between Great Britain and America.</P>
<P>CHARLES PHILE, the claimant hearing of this arrival, procured a deputation from the naval offi∣cer of the port of Philadelphia, dated the 27th of February; and on the same day went down to Glou∣cester, and seized the vessel under authority of his deputation, and by virtue of an act of assembly of this state.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="024407_0867_0FC73069C4F85AA8"/>IN this manner Phile possessed himself of the vessel, and afterwards had her brought up to the city, secured her at the wharf, and placed a guard on board.</P>
<P>AFTER this, viz. on the 2d of March the libel∣lants entered on board this vessel, and by virtue of an ordinance of congress of the 26th of December 1776, authorising
<Q>the people of the country, or detachments from the army, to make prize of the vessels and goods of the enemy that may happen to be taken near the shore,</Q>—seized the brig and her cargo as <HI>lawful prize,</HI> and on the same day made report to the judge of admiralty, that they had so done. On the 6th they filed their libel in the register's office; and on the same day a writ of attachment issued, and the marshal of the court took possession of her in behalf of the libellants.</P>
<P>AFTERWARDS, viz. on the 10th of March, Charles Phile entered his claim in this court for the vessel and cargo, as a captor also, under the same ordinance of congress.</P>
<P>THESE transactions, as to the manner and time of the performance, stand uncontroverted by the par∣ties. Of the remaining testimony exhibited in
<PB N="63" REF="024407_0868_0FC7306AFB179428"/>
this cause, there is but one circumstance of any im∣portance, viz. when Phile made the seizure on the 27th of February, he was asked by the captain of the brig, by what authority he did it? and if it was for congress? To which he answered NO, <HI>it was for the naval officer.</HI> Then shewing the captain his deputation, he said, <HI>that was his authority.</HI></P>
<P>SUCH are the materials upon which this cause has been argued, and it is urged in behalf of the claimant, that notwithstanding the prior date of Mr. Pringle's libel, Phile was in fact the first and real captor, and was in the actual possession of the prize at the time of the seizure made by the libel∣lants: that although the claimant made his seizure by virtue of the deputation of the naval officer, and under the act of assembly, in which indeed he was mistaken in point of law, because the act does not touch the vessel, but the cargo only; yet be∣ing so possessed, he acquired a right which could not be injured by his error in judgment, and was good against any fellow-subject: that this right is founded on two principles, viz. <HI>occupancy,</HI> in the civil, and the doctrine of <HI>remitter,</HI> in the common law.</P>
<P>UNDER the first, it is said, that goods belong∣ing to an enemy, being out of the protection of the
<PB N="64" REF="024407_0869_0FC73071F05828E0"/>
law, may be considered as <HI>bona vacantia,</HI> and he who can first get possession acquires a right in them by <HI>occupancy;</HI> and that this doctrine is the only foundation on which the right of capture is built: and, under the second, that, where a person ob∣tains peaceable possession of property by an insuf∣ficient title, having a more ancient and better title, the law will <HI>remit</HI> him to his better title, and consider him as holding under that in prefe∣rence. Both which doctrines are said to apply in favour of the claimant in the present case, inas∣much as he had possession of the vessel before the seizure made by the libellants and held her by <HI>oc∣cupancy;</HI> and that having a good right under the or∣dinance of congress to make prize of goods be∣longing to the enemy, and taken near the shore, although in fact he seized the same by virtue of his deputation from the naval officer, yet being so pos∣sessed, the law will not remit him to his better title.</P>
<P>ON the contrary it has been urged—That when the claimant first went on board this vessel, he stood in a two fold capacity, as a militia man of the country, and as the deputy of the naval officer, and that the rights and powers of these characters are as perfectly distinct in law as if they existed in two different persons: that when he was as∣ked in which capacity he meant to act, he expressly declared that he made the seizure in behalf of the
<PB N="65" REF="024407_0870_0FC7307406DDACD8"/>
naval officer: that when an agent so situate hath made his election, and afterwards finds himself in the wrong, he cannot have recourse to his better power to confirm an act done by an insufficient one: that Charles Phile, the present naval officer, seiz∣ed the vessel, but Charles Phile, the militia man, who must, in the eye of the law, be considered as a different person, did not exercise the power given him by the ordinance of congress, and made no capture in that capacity, and therefore the vessel remained liable to capture by any militia man who should think fit to make use of the right vested in him by the ordinance, notwithstanding he might find her in the possession of the naval officer, or of his deputy, who, as such, had no power to hold her under the act of assembly.</P>
<P>THAT Phile cannot claim by <HI>occupancy</HI> more than the two men who rowed him down the ri∣ver, and went on board with him; and that the doctrine of <HI>remitter</HI> does not apply, because the ancient and better right alluded to, was not a right peculiar to the claimant, but which every militia man in the country held in as full force as himself, by virtue of the ordinance of congress. And final∣ly, that be that ancient right what it may, the claim∣ant disavowed and rejected it by his voluntary elec∣tion, which throws the whole doctrine of remitter
<PB N="66" REF="024407_0871_0FC730758064EBF0"/>
out of the question, which is so purely an opera∣tion of law under particular circumstances, that the interference of the party is fatal to its effect.</P>
<P>THE question which first presents in this cause is—Whether the seizure made by the claimant, as deputy naval officer, operated as a capture of the <HI>vessel</HI> under the ordinance of congress or not? It is certain, that when Phile entered on board this brig, he was possessed of two distinct powers. By the one, derived from the act of assembly, he might have made a seizure of the cargo only; by the other, founded in the ordinance of congress, he might have taken as prize, both the vessel and cargo. In this situation the claimant explicitly dis∣avowed and rejected his right under the ordinance, not only by words, but by unequivocal actions; and the law will not now force upon him a right so deliberately disclaimed, to the exclusion of ano∣ther claiming under the same right, formally and expressly exercised.</P>
<P>IT is said, that no advantage ought to be taken of the ignorance of the claimant on a sudden emer∣gency. But, besides that his procuring a deputation from the naval officer, and going four miles down the river to execute his purpose, cannot be called a sudden act, his subsequent conduct fully evinces
<PB N="67" REF="024407_0872_0FC73077011B0520"/>
a deliberate determination of the right on which he meant to depend. He made the seizure in be∣half of the naval officer, under the act of assembly, on the 27th of February, and held the property by that title, to the 10th of March following, du∣ring which time no libel or information was filed by him in the admiralty office, no ship's papers produced, nor the vessel put by him into the mar∣shal's possession, as a prize taken from the enemy. These circumstances operate strongly against the claimant's being considered as a captor under the ordinance of congress.</P>
<P>BUT further, even supposing him to have been the first and real captor of this vessel and her cargo under the ordinance, there yet remains a legal obstacle to his enjoying the prize; since what∣ever right he might have acquired as a captor, he forfeited it by his subsequent conduct. In the ad∣miralty law of this state (p. 314) it is enacted,
<Q>If any person who shall have charge of, or bring a prize into this port, shall neglect or refuse to de∣liver up the same to the marshal of the court of admiralty, and libel her within three days after her arrival, such person shall forfeit all his inter∣est in the said prize to the use of the common∣wealth, and be subjected to the penalties of con∣tempt,</Q> &amp;c. &amp;c.
It is evident, therefore, that
<PB N="68" REF="024407_0873_0FC7307F61F534F0"/>
the cla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> did not consider himself as the captor of a prize, till after the libel fled by Pringle and Shee, otherwise he would have taken care to com∣ply with the injunctions of the admiralty law.</P>
<P>AS to the doctrines of <HI>occupancy</HI> and <HI>remitter,</HI> if they operated at all it must have been at the mo∣ment the claimant first entered on board this vessel; and if so, why does he not libel for the cargo as well as the vessel? But I am of opinion that no force can warp those doctrines to fit the present case.</P>

<HEAD>(1781.) MILLER versus THE RESOLUTION.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A claim filed in behalf of the shippers of the cargo; also a claim in behalf of the owners of the ship.</HEAD>
<P>THE ship <HI>Resolution,</HI> belonging to Brandlight and Sons, merchants in Amsterdam, sailed from the Texel on the 9th of January, 1780, bound for the island of St. Eustatius. This voyage was interrupt∣ed by stress of weather, which obliged her to put into Lisbon, where she remained some months to refit, but afterwards arrived at St. Eustatius. From St. Eustatius she sailed for the island of Dominica, where she arrived on the 1st of October, 1780. In March, 1781, she sailed from Dominica for Am∣sterdam, with a valuable cargo of sugar and coffee,
<PB N="71" REF="024407_0876_0FC73083BAC9C630"/>
shipped by sundry persons, certified to be <HI>capitu∣lants in the island of Dominica;</HI> which cargo was consigned to Messrs. Brandlight and Sons, of Am∣sterdam, the owners of the vessel. Soon after the commencement of her voyage from Dominica, she. was captured by a British armed vessel, and taken as prize into <HI>Nevis,</HI> where admiral Rodney exa∣mined her papers, and thereupon dismissed her. She again proceeded on her voyage, but was after∣wards captured by another British vessel, from whom she was re-captured by an American priva∣teer; from this privateer she was again taken by a British ship, and finally retaken from her by Peter Miller, the libellant in this cause, and sent into the port of Philadelphia. It is not contended but that in each and every of the captures and re-captures, she remained more than 24 hours in the possession of the conqueror. Being thus found in the hands of the enemy, and taken from them by force of arms, the libellants pray that both ship and cargo may be condemned as lawful prize and booty of war.</P>

Bouillé,</HI> general of the French forces in the Wind∣ward Islands—that by the terms of this capitulati∣on, all the property and estates in Dominica, with their produce were secured to the inhabitants, and protected from confiscation; particularly by the 17th article, in these words—<Q>The merchants of the island may receive vessels to their address. from all parts of the world (English vessels ex∣cepted) without their being confiscated; and they may sell their merchandize, and may carry on their trade, and the port shall be entirely free for them for that purpose, paying the customary duties paid in the French islands.</Q>

that it was also in proof, that the king of England, by his proclamation, dated in December; 1780, extended the effects of the capitulation of Domi∣nica, to Dutch vessels for four months, notwith∣standing the rupture between Great Britain and Holland, by the capture of St. Eustatius: and, that this ship, under the sanction of the said capi∣tulation which secured her and her cargo from capture by the French or Americans, and under the said proclamation, which protected her from British capture, sailed from Dominica, with the property of capitulants on board; and that the passport of monsieur <HI>Duchilleau,</HI> the French go∣vernor of Dominica, endorsed on the manifesto of the cargo, ought to protect this property from be∣ing made prize of by the friends and allies of France.</P>
<P>IT has been further insisted—That a re-captor acquires no other right than what the captor had; inferring that as the British captor could not have procured a condemnation (as appears by the acqui∣tal of admiral Rodney) neither can an American re-captor make this vessel legal prize—that the Bri∣tish captain should be considered as a pirate, and that the law is, that goods taken by pirates, and again retaken from them, shall be restored to the former owner—that if it should be objected, that most of
<PB N="74" REF="024407_0879_0FC7308FC116ABD8"/>
the real consignees of this cargo are not inhabi∣tants of Dominica, and therefore not within the capitulation; it is answered, that article the 9th extends the operation of this capitulation to absent inhabitants, even such as are in the service of the king of Great Britain having property in the island, whose business may be transacted by attornies; and that if the attorney is an inhabitant, and signed the capitulation, it is the same thing in effect as if the principal had done it. And, lastly, that although no express authority can be produced to prove di∣rectly that allies in war are bound by the capitula∣tions, conventions, and treaties of each other, re∣ciprocally; yet a striking analogy may be found in the case of <HI>ransom.</HI> That it cannot be denied, but that if a French vessel takes a prize, and <HI>ran∣soms</HI> her for a limited time, the ransom bill would protect the property from capture and condemna∣tion by the Americans. If, therefore, the act of an individual captain of a French privateer can screen the property of an enemy from an ally, much more should the solemn capitulation of a French general with the whole inhabitants of a captured island bind the same ally.</P>
<P>TO this it has been replied; that the ship <HI>Re∣solution</HI> and her cargo were found in the possession of the enemy, who held the same by force as
<PB N="75" REF="024407_0880_0FC7309660927488"/>
their property for more than 24 hours which brings the case strictly within the ordinance of congress of February last, which excludes any claims of former owners after a possession of 24 hours by the enemy: that we have no business to enquire by what right the enemy became pos∣sessed: it is sufficient for us that we found it there: that the doctrine respecting pirates does not apply, because the British as a sovereign nation has an undoubted right to wage war, and to take prizes, which pirates have not: that if any subject of a sovereign power takes unlawfully, let him or his prince answer the wrong, the re-captors at war with them being altogether blameless, whose right to take from an enemy cannot be doubted: that it appears evidently by the letters and other exhibits in this cause, that this cargo is in fact British property, and not the property of the inhabitants of Dominica; and although con∣signed to merchants in Amsterdam, the nett pro∣ceeds were to be remitted to merchants in London, and other parts of the British dominion: that it is absurd and untrue to suppose that the benefits of the capitulation were designed to extend to London merchants who had never been inhabitants of the island of Dominica, and who are and will remain British subjects, aiding, by their
<PB N="76" REF="024407_0881_0FC7309802D44DE0"/>
wealth and influence, in the war against France and her allies: that the captulation included on∣ly real inhabitants, either present on the island, or absent on business at the time, and placed them in a state of perfect neutrality with respect to the war; a character which can by no means be ap∣plied to the real consignees of this cargo: that if the effects of this capitulation were to be thus extended, France would have obtained a conquest which can produce nothing but expence, trouble, and loss to her, but will tend to strengthen and enrich the enemy; and that it would be for the present, the interest of Great Britain to surren∣der all her West-India islands upon the same terms.</P>
<P>IT has been further urged by the counsel for the libellants, that allies are not mutually bound by every <HI>ex parte</HI> treaty or convention: that con∣sent is necessary to include one in the engage∣ment made by the other; as for instance, in a truce or cessation of hostilities: that France does not deem herself so bound, is evident from her conduct with respect to Bermuda and the Ba∣hama islands, whose property congress have ex∣empted from capture and condemnation by Ame∣ricans; yet their vessels are confiscated in the
<PB N="77" REF="024407_0882_0FC730997B953838"/>
French courts of admiralty: and that this ex∣emption, granted by congress to Bermudians, runs strictly parallel with the terms granted by the French general to the people of Dominica, so far as allies in war were to be affected by such trea∣ties.</P>
<P>THAT the law respecting <HI>ransoms</HI> cannot apply to the present case, because, if, after our ally has made a capture, and discharged the prize on a, promised ransom, we should violate the ransom bill, we should in fact plunder our friend of his actually acquired property; and it is for this reason that allies are bound by ransom bills: that this case coming precisely within the ordinance of con∣gress respecting 24 hours possession by the enemy, this court is bound to decree according to that ordinance, and hath no power to judge how far its operation may, or may not, under particu∣lar circumstances, affect the terms of our ali∣ance with France, the true limits of which are on∣ly to be ascertained by the sovereignty of the states, and are not submitted to the determination this court.</P>
<P>THAT, as to the passport subscribed by mon∣sieur <HI>Du Challeau,</HI> he did it as a matter of course in
<PB N="78" REF="024407_0883_0FC7309B01294D60"/>
consequence of the depositions annexed to the bills of lading, which were taken by the British judge of the island, and who might probably be in the interest of the parties; or, at least, that it was done with the official negligence too usual in pass∣ing custom-house papers. It was further suggest∣ed, that the manifest variance between the bills of lading, with their depositions annexed, and the private letters of advice found on board; the di∣rect fraud manifest in some of those letters, and the mysterious complexion of others, are alone suffi∣cient to justify a condemnation of this property; double papers and fraudulent clearances being le∣gal cause of confiscation.</P>
<P>IN short, that this whole business appears to be a mercantile scheme concerted between British merchants and Brandlight and Sons, of Amster∣dam, in conjunction with the shippers at Dominica, to impose on the French governor, and to derive an unfair advantage from the liberal terms of the capitulation: that, if this property is to be deem∣ed <HI>neutral,</HI> the true doctrine is, if a neutral volun∣tarily puts his property on board an enemy's ship, he does it at his own risk; but if an enemy unjustly takes neutral property, and the same is retaken, the remedy is against the enemy who did the wrong, and not against the recaptor who only did
<PB N="79" REF="024407_0884_0FC730A36AEEA960"/>
his duty: that it is true, that the passport of go∣vernor <HI>Duchalleau,</HI> recommends this vessel to pass unmolested by the friends of France, but does not say she shall not be taken from the enemy in case she should fall into their hands: that if the inha∣bitants of Dominica, in their present situation, be considered either as French or as British subjects, still the recapture is good; if French, then the property (supposing it to belong to the shippers) having been more than twenty four hours in the possession of the enemy, is prize to the recaptor by the marine ordinances of France and America; if British, it belonged to the enemy, and is there∣fore prize. And lastly, that this capitulation should not be construed to extend further than the pro∣tection of property upon the island, and within its ports and harbours, but cannot reasonably be ex∣pected to insure safety on the high seas in the midst of a raging war.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="judgment">
<HEAD>JUDGMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS cause, so far as it respects the cargo of the ship <HI>Resolution,</HI> rests principally on one que∣stion, viz. whether the United States by their al∣liance with France, are, or are not to be conside∣red as parties in the capitulation made by the Marquis De Bouillé with the inhabitants of Do∣minica.
<PB N="80" REF="024407_0885_0FC730A4C8F46778"/>
No authority has been produced, and I believe that none can be, to shew that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lies are mutually bound in all cases. It is manifest, that it is not generally so understood; because it is usual in forming treaties of alliance to insert special clauses specifying those cases, wherein the pro∣mises and engagements of the one shall bind the other: for it would be a very dangerous doctrine that should bind sovereign powers in engagements to which they had neither expressly or implicitly given consent, or that one ally should necessarily become a party in the conventions which the ge∣nerals and officers of the other may, under particu∣lar straits and circumstances, make with the com∣mon enemy, unless the ally be mentioned in the convention, and the terms thereof be afterwards acceded to by him. Thus, in the case of Domini∣ca, had governor Stuart, when he surrendered the island to the marquis de Bouillé expected that the United States should be bound by the terms of the capitulation, he would have made this one of the articles, and not entrusted so important a point to a speculative question, how far one ally may or may not be virtually bound by the engagements of the other. This, however, he has not done, either because it would imply an acknowledgment of the sovereignty of the United States, or because he deemed the objects of the capitulation to be li∣mited
<PB N="81" REF="024407_0886_0FC730A680196018"/>
to property within the island. Be this as it may, the British could not reasonably complain that the French had violated the articles of the capitulation should the Americans take the goods of the inhabitants of Dominica found upon the high seas, because such an assurance made no part of the stipulation.
<Q>If he who can and ought to have explained himself clearly and plainly, has not done it, it is the worse for him; he cannot be allowed to introduce subsequent restrictions which he has not expressed.</Q>
Vattel, B. 2. ch. 17. sec. 174.</P>
<P>BUT whatever doubts there may be of the right of Americans to take the property of the people of Dominica under the present circumstances, there can be none of taking British property, wherever found, without any danger of impairing the friendship of our good ally. And from a scru∣tiny of the papers found on board this vessel, there is strong reason to believe that this cargo, howe∣ver artificially covered, is, in fact, British pro∣perty.</P>
<P>AS to the general doctrine respecting allies, the case of Bermudas is, I think, strong in point. The vessels of that island were by congress exempted from capture by Americans, and yet the French
<PB N="82" REF="024407_0887_0FC730AC82DBE730"/>
made prize of them whenever they could; nor was it ever suggested, that they had thereby violat∣ed the faith of the alliance. Had the British ex∣pected, or France desired, that the United States should be parties in the capitulation of Dominica, it cannot be doubted, but that this would have been made one of the terms of that capitulation, or tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> France would, e'er this, have signified her desire to congress, and that congress would have instruct∣ed the masters of privateers as to this matter.</P>
<P>HAVING made no national agreement to spare the property of the people of Dominica, when found on the high seas, much less are we bound to rescue it from the hands of an enemy at our risk and expence, in order to restore it, salvage free, to their use. This would be to put them on a bet∣ter footing than our own merchants, whose pro∣perty, after 24 hours possession by the enemy, would be confiscated to the re-captor, whereas it is contended that no confiscation whatever should pass on the property of the people of Dominica.</P>
<P>BEING fully satisfied as to this general point, it renders a minute display of the striking contradic∣tions between the bills of lading and letters of ad∣vice, and other papers found on board this vessel, the less necessary. Many of them are manifestly
<PB N="83" REF="024407_0888_0FC730AE6FE94DF8"/>
fraudulent▪ and although the property is carefully wrapped in neutral covers, the nett proceeds ap∣pear to be finally intended for subjects of Great Britain, residing at London or elsewhere.</P>
<P>WITH respect to the king of England's procla∣mation, I conceive that it is founded on partial, not on general grounds. Were it not that this, with four or five other Dutch vessels were at this time to sail from Dominica, freighted with the property of British merchants, it is more than probable that this proclamation had never been published.</P>
<P>I adjudge that the cargo of the ship Resolution be condemned as lawful prize to the libellants; and that the ship Resolution, with her tackle, apparel and furniture be restored to Brandlight and Sons, merchants of Amsterdam.</P>
<P>N. B. The claimants appealed from this decree; and, after long argument, the judges of appeal re∣versed the decree, so far as the same respected the condemnation of the cargo, which they fully ac∣quitted, upon the shippers paying freight to the owners of the ship.</P>
<P>THERE was afterwards a re-hearing of this cause before the court of appeal, on a suggestion
<PB N="84" REF="024407_0889_0FC730B174C1DC00"/>
of new testimony having been found amongst some papers taken in a ship (the Ersten) bound from Ostend to Dominica: but the court adhered to their judgment; except only as to some part of the cargo, which was condemned on account of irregularities in the bills of lading, and letters of advice, respecting those particular articles.</P>

<HEAD>CASSEN versus THE TRISTRAM SHANDY.</HEAD>
<P>CASSEN, commander of the privateer ship <HI>Rising Sun,</HI> sailed from the Delaware, in company with the sloop <HI>Jane,</HI> commanded by Samuel Young, the claimant: the sloop being under con∣voy of the ship. Both vessels belonged to the same owners (one person excepted, who had a share in the sloop, but was not concerned in the ship.) The ship was bound on a cruise, as a pri∣vateer, and the sloop on a trading voyage. Whilst
<PB N="85" REF="024407_0890_0FC730B2406A3B50"/>
these vessels were yet in company, they discovered the brig <HI>Tristram Shandy,</HI> a vessel belonging to the enemy, and got to windward of her. The ship then bore down upon, and took the prize; but the sloop, without changing her course, pro∣ceeded on her voyage. It is also in evidence, that the sloop was observed by the crew of the prize, eight or ten minutes before she surrendered, at the distance of about six miles. Whereupon, the own∣er, who is singly concerned in the sloop, has filed a claim, in the name of Samuel Young, <HI>qui tam,</HI> for a share of the prize, as being in sight at the time of the capture, under the general rule of law.</P>
<P>AGAINST this claim it has been urged, that the sloop ought to have no share in this prize, because it is in testimony, that she not only did nothing to∣wards the capture, but, in fact, avoided it, not al∣tering her course, or manifesting the least intention to be considered as a joint captor; insisting, that an intention to possess is requisite to the acquire∣ment of property—that although by the rule of law, it is not necessary to enquire how far a vessel in sight, did or did not contribute to the capture of a prize, yet some attempt, some inclination, to take, ought to appear, otherwise the law will not force property on those who voluntarily abandon it; and
<PB N="86" REF="024407_0891_0FC730B3BA260450"/>
the case of <HI>Rice</HI> versus <HI>Taylor</HI> was particularly referred to, and relied upon. (Vide p. 16.)</P>
<P>ARBITRARY rules and presumptions of law are established in profound wisdom, and are the result of much experience. Passing by the uncertain equity of certain cases, they look only to general justice. All that is necessary in the application of them is to ascertain whether the case comes within the rule or not. If it does, the rule ought not to be violated, nor should any evidence be admitted to defeat its operation; because the law, delighting in certainty, will not suffer an investigation which can occasion contradictory testimony, perjury, and endless litigation.</P>
<P>IN the case of <HI>Rice</HI> versus <HI>Taylor,</HI> the <HI>jury found</HI> that the claimant's vessel did not, by her presence, contribute to the surrender of the prize; her si∣tuation rendering it in fact impossible; and, there∣fore, the claim was dismissed, the case not coming within the verge of the legal presumption. But no such impossibility appears in the present case. Had the enemy been a match for the ship, or made an obstinate resistance, the sloop was suffici∣ently near, and in a capacity to join her force. But as the prize was not able to maintain a contest with the ship, it is to be presumed that the sloop's con∣tinuing
<PB N="87" REF="024407_0892_0FC730BC74D26660"/>
her course, was not an abandonment of any share or concern in the prize, but because that she saw that her assistance was altogether unnecessary.</P>
<P>THE supposed want of an intention to take, is not sufficient to exclude the claimants from a share of the prize. The claim filed in this cause is proof of at least an intention to possess whatever the law may award. And although it has been suggested, that this suit is in fact brought by one of the own∣ers, in the name of the captain and crew of the sloop Jane, who are absent, and had no intention of making such claim, yet the court will not allow the distinction, but consider captain Young and his mariners as prosecuting their suit by their proctor.</P>
<P>NEITHER is there any reason why the circum∣stance of the sloop's being under the convoy of the ship, should affect the right of the claimants. The assistance which one vessel may give another in battle is the reason of the law, and this reason is as applicable to vessels under convoy as to any o∣thers. Whenever two vessels of the same nation are in company, they are under reciprocal protec∣tion, and mutually bound to assist each other: but when a vessel of superior force sails out of her in∣tended course, or is purposely sent for the protecti∣on of another, the owners of the latter should make
<PB N="88" REF="024407_0893_0FC730BD7B291C70"/>
recompence for the service; but this will not ex∣clude the protected vessel from those rights which her force, small as it may be, may entitle her to, and which the general rule of law assigns without distinction.</P>

<P>HAVING entered as a landsman on board the privateer <HI>Rising Sun,</HI> and signed articles for a cruise of four months: the privateer was success∣ful; and the libellant was sent in with one of her prizes, and soon afterwards fell sick. During the cruise the <HI>Rising Sun</HI> came into port to refit. Be∣ing at Philadelphia, a great part of the crew left
<PB N="90" REF="024407_0895_0FC730C08093D3C0"/>
her; whereupon the captain (or owners) publish∣ed an advertisement, calling upon the officers, seamen, and mariners, belonging to the <HI>Rising Sun,</HI> to repair on board by a certain day, in or∣der to complete the cruise. One third of the crew, however, neglecting to appear, the owners and officers agreed to break up the cruise, opened a new rendezvous, and enlisted a crew under a new set of articles. The ship sailed on this second cruise, the four months of the first having not yet expired. Soon after her last sailing she captured the Tristiam Shandy, and the Dimsdale, both which were condemned as prize. It appeared in tes∣timony, that the Tristiam Shandy was taken be∣fore the expiration of the first cruise, and the Dimsdale some days after. The libellant did not appear on the day advertised, neither did he sign the second set of articles, being sick at the time.</P>
<P>AS this cause touches a general doctrine, viz. how far owners are justifiable in breaking up a cruise, without the consent of all concerned, it wears a face of considerable importance. I have attended to it in this view, and am of opinion, that shipping articles form a contract between the ow∣ners on the one part, and the officers and crew on the other, and are for the period specified, in
<PB N="91" REF="024407_0896_0FC730C8EA15ED00"/>
full force with respect to the contracting parties. And this contract is not made with the officers and crew as an aggregate body, but with each mariner individually. Upon this ground, I think the contract cannot be totally dissolved (as hath been contended) by the will of any majority on either side, however great. If a single mariner withholds his consent, and the cruise is broke up by the rest of the concerned, and a new cruise commenced, as in the present case, this must be done, subject to the legal claim of the unconsen∣ting mariner, of wages or prize money that may accrue during the term of the first cruise for which he contracted. If it were otherwise, if owners could for their own convenience, or from an ap∣parent or real necessity, break up a cruise, those of the crew who may be languishing in captivity, or may be confined on shore by wounds or sickness incurred in the service of the ship, or otherwise, might be excluded from the advantages of a peri∣od of time for which they had engaged to run all hazards, and of which they may as yet have only experienced the misfortunes.</P>

<P>JACOB Miller, and others, had formed a com∣pact to purchase a vessel, load her with provi∣sions, naval stores, &amp;c. and then clear her out from the port of Philadelphia, as for some legal voyage; but, in fact, to take her into New York, for the supply of the enemy. The Fan∣ny was purchased for this purpose. But, before the scheme was ripe for execution, one Hollingshead, who was to have been sailing master for the voyage, divulged the secret. In consequence of which the libellant seized the vessel at the wharf where she had lain previous to the time when Miller purcha∣sed her for the purpose aforesaid. One Riggens, who was also privy to the plan, confirmed the te∣stimony of Hollingshead, as to the general scheme.
<PB N="93" REF="024407_0898_0FC730CBC3D20ED0"/>
At the time of the seizure, the brig had taken in only twenty barrels of Tar, and had not yet ship∣ped her mariners.</P>
<P>THE testimony in this cause amounts to no more than a treasonable intent. Had this vessel received her cargo on board, shipped her mariners, and hawled off from the warf, the intent would then have been so far carried into execution, as that the vessel and cargo might have been con∣fiscated, and the parties punished under the ordi∣nance of congress. As the case stands, the ow∣ners might have changed their minds as to the ge∣neral design, or they might have thought some o∣ther vessel more suitable to the purpose. To bring the matter properly before this court, the identical vessel employed in an illegal design must be taken in the fact, for the admiralty cannot con∣fiscate one vessel for the fault of another although belonging to the same owners. A vessel cannot be said to be taken in pursuit of an illegal voyage whilst she remains fast at a wharf, without a cargo on board, and without mariners.</P>

<HEAD><HI>GIBBS</HI> versus <HI>THE TWO FRIENDS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE brig <HI>Susannah,</HI> belonging to George Gibbs, cleared out from the naval office in the port of Rhode Island, and sailed with a cargo on board, as for Hispaniola, but in fact for Turk's Islands. Being on her voyage she was discovered, pursued, and captured by Josiah Crane, master of the brigantine <HI>Two Friends,</HI> belonging to subjects of the United Netherlands, and furnished with letters of marque and reprisal against the subjects of the king of Great Britain. Holland had not at this time entered into any treaty with, or acknow∣ledged the independence of, the United States of America. Captain Crane took out part of the crew of the Savannah, and put a prize master on board, and ordered her for Philadelphia; but the Susannah was again captured during her voy∣age
<PB N="96" REF="024407_0901_0FC72CC0C73C8230"/>
to Philadelphia by a British privateer, ta∣ken to New York, and there condemned. The <HI>Two Friends</HI> arrived at Philadelphia, where Gibbs the owner of the Susannah libelled against her, and against captain Crane for reparation of the loss and damage sustained.</P>
<P>IN considering this case, two obvious points present, viz.</P>
<P>FIRST. Hath the brig Susannah so offended by her intended voyage to Turk's Islands as to afford probable cause of capture and confiscation?</P>
<P>SECONDLY. If not, who ought to satisfy the owner for the loss of his vessel and cargo?</P>
<P>ON the first point the question occurs, whether Turk's Islands, may, or may not, be considered as property under the dominion of Great Britain? Whatever might have been the situation of these islands in the years 1778 and 1779, it is evident that at present they are abandoned by every na∣tion, there having been no officer who hath exer∣cised civil or military powers there under the authority of any government whatever for at least these two years past. If the British ever had legal dominion over these islands, they have a∣bandoned
<PB N="97" REF="024407_0902_0FC72CCAA9DF5088"/>
their right, and released the inhabitants from all allegiance by withdrawing all protection. So that those people may truly be said to be in a state of nature, unless they have formed some government of their own. What offence then can arise from trading with those islands? It is plain, from the clearances and entries in our own naval offices, that this trade hath not been deemed unlawful: and it is also in evidence, that American, French, and Spanish vessels, con∣stantly go to these islands for salt, and no body hath heretofore questioned the legality of this commerce.</P>
<P>BUT is said, that the variance between the office clearance and an invoice found on board, marking the real destination of the voyage, affords pro∣bable cause of capture, and even a sufficient ground for confiscation. I find, however, that it is not an unusual practice for merchants to clear out as for one legal port, but with a design of go∣ing to some other legal port, in order to conceal the real voyage, for mercantile purposes. Nor hath this practice ever been deemed an offence, or the papers found on board a vessel under such circumstances been considered as double pape<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, such as should induce a condemnation.</P>
<P><PB REF="024407_0903_0FC72CCC07181210"/>THE next question is, Who ought to be an∣swerable for the injury done? the captain, or his owners, or both?</P>
<P>THE relation between the owners and master of a vessel hath, to many purposes, been conside∣red as that of master and servant; and the law is clear, that the master is bound by whatever the servant doth by his order, under his autho∣rity, or in the prosecution of his service. See <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st. Black. 429. It has been contended, however, that captain Crane was not in the prosecution of his owners service when he made this capture, the object of the voyage being merely mercan∣tile, and not to take prizes. But as this vessel was duly commissioned to take prizes, and the owners and captain would have shared the pro∣duce of a legal capture, this distinction cannot be admitted, but the owners and captain must be considered as jointly answerable.</P>

<HEAD>CLINTON versus THE BRIG HANNAH AND SHIP GENERAL KNOX.</HEAD>
<P>A Plea to the jurisdiction of the court was filed in this cause: and the question was, Whether a <HI>Ship-Wright</HI> might sue in the admiralty for his contract wages for building a ship or vessel design∣ed for navigation on the high seas?</P>
<P>AFTER long argument, the judge gave his opi∣nion as follows.</P>
<P>THE authorities which the libellants have ur∣ged in favour of the jurisdiction of this court, in the present case, are Cro. Ch. 296. and 1st Rol∣le 533. All the other authorities adduced having reference to those, except one in 1 Stra. 707.</P>
<P>IN the first edition of Cro. cha. page 296, we find resolutions upon cases of admiralty jurisdiction
<PB N="100" REF="024407_0905_0FC72CCF4B380A30"/>
subscribed by all the judges of both benches, in April, 1632. Wherein, amongst other things, it is resolved, that a ship-wright may sue in the admiralty, provided his suit be against the ship. <HI>Rolle,</HI> as a faithful abridger, gives the law as it then stood under the authority of these resoluti∣ons. In article 19, he mentions the doctrine re∣specting ship-wrights, and cites the cafe of <HI>Tas∣ker</HI> and <HI>Gale.</HI> And in article 21, he gives the law respecting charter parties, adding these re∣markable words:
<Q>As it was declared by the court to have been lately resolved by all the judges of England.</Q>
So that those resolu∣tions seem to be the only foundation upon which these doctrines rest. And it is very observable, that although <HI>Croke</HI> records the resolutions as they were subscribed in Hillary term, the eighth of Charles, yet he does not report the case of <HI>Tasker</HI> versus <HI>Gale,</HI> although adjudged (according to <HI>Rolle</HI>) in the ninth of Charles, which must have been but a few months after. Neither hath any other reporter of that period noticed this case. From which it seems probable, that those resolutions, and the judgment in the case of Tas∣ker versus Gale, were not admitted as good law e∣ven in that day.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="024407_0906_0FC72CD9623F6520"/>BUT it is further observable, that when <HI>Sir Harbottle Grimestone</HI> published Croke's reports in the year 1657, he prefixed, even to this first e∣dition, a declaration under the title <HI>Mantissa,</HI> that the resolutions of the judges in Feb. 1632, were not of authority: and for this reason (ac∣cording to Comyns) those resolutions were totally omitted in the subsequent editions of that work. Since that time no instance can be found in the books, where either these resolutions, or the case of Tasker versus Gale adjudged thereupon, have been referred to either by the court, or in the pleadings in any adjudged case, except in the case of Wooward versus Bonithan, Sir. T. Raymond. p. 3: and there the court declared, that those resolutions had been denied by several judges, and renounced by even some of those who had subscribed them. And of this, <HI>Danvers</HI> also takes particular notice, p. 271. Therefore the autho∣rity of these resolutions seems to have been abolish∣ed by general consent.</P>
<P>BUT another case has been referred to as au∣thority in point, viz. 1st Stra. 707. The report is very short, and in these words:
<Q>On a motion for a prohibition, it was held, that a <HI>carpenter</HI> may sue for wages in the admiralty.</Q>
This report, however, is too slight and solitary to au∣thorise
<PB N="102" REF="024407_0907_0FC72CDC021B4A98"/>
a decision contrary to general established rules. The word <HI>carpenter</HI> doth not precisely in∣dicate a ship-wright, but may be applicable to a mariner on board a vessel; and as the cases refer∣red to in the margin of this report, respecting the officers of a ship who sued in the admiralty as ma∣riners, the probability is, that this also was an officer called the <HI>ship's-carpenter</HI>: A doubt having arisen whether the subordinate officers of a ship, as well as the master, were not prohibited from suing in the admiralty for wages.</P>
<P>IF the resolutions of the judges in 1632, and the decision in the case of Tasker versus Gale, were admitted as law, and if the carpenter men∣tioned in 1st Stra. 707, was the ship-wright or builder, how is it possible that the judges so lately as the 1765, should declare in court, that no instance could be found where both the contract and service were to be done on land, within the body of a country, that the common law courts ever permitted the admiralty to have jurisdiction? I refer to 2d <HI>Wilson,</HI> p. 265: and this opinion was given in the case of a pilot suing for services done, indeed within the body of a county, but in a case of a much stronger maritime com∣plexion than the present.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="024407_0908_0FC72CE477BB3E10"/>THERE are several exceptions to the general rules of law respecting admiralty jurisdiction, as ascertained by the statutes: such as suits for mari∣ners wages, and on hypothecations made by the master in foreign parts, &amp;c. &amp;c. which have been so often contested, and so often allowed, for good and weighty reasons, that they have become con∣firmed law, and it would be in vain now to oppose the general rule to the general practice. But this does not appear to the case with respect to ship-wrights; neither are the same reasons appli∣capable to them. Their contract is made with persons whom they know, or ought to know; their services are all executed within the body of the county, and mostly on dry land above high∣water mark; their wages have no reference to a voyage performed, or to be performed; the ship-wrights have no interest or concern what∣ever in the vessel after she is on float, and the merchant hath paid for her; and lastly, the prac∣tice of former times doth not justify the admiral∣ty's taking cognizance of their suits.</P>
<P>LET the bill be dismissed, as not being within the jurisdiction of the court.</P>

In her way to New York, she was re-captured by the libellant, and sent into this port, having been several days in the possession of the enemy.</P>
<P>ON the trial, one of the owners of the cargo appeared, and urged the tenor of an ordinance of congress, passed the 26th of February, 1782, in his favour, respecting the vessels and cargoes of subjects of the United States, going from one port to another, and taken within any arm of the sea, &amp;c. laden with the produce of the country, and afterwards retaken by a fellow subject: ordaining, that the same shall be restored to the first owner, on payment of reasonable salvage, not exceeding one fourth of the value, without any regard to the time of possession by the enemy.

<P>THESE are the same libellants who recovered against the Glocester, two years since, on a like
<PB N="107" REF="024407_0912_0FC72CF3CC9D2BF8"/>
plea. (Vide p. 55.) In the case of the <HI>Gloces∣ter,</HI> the council for the respondent did not minute∣ly investigate the facts: but admitting the testimo∣ny, as produced on the part of the libellants, re∣specting the force used, rested the defence solely on points of law. The facts were now more strictly scrutinized, and new testimony adduced, amongst which the respondent presented the deposition of Silas Foster, one of the Holker's crew: but it was objected, that Foster was an interested wit∣ness, and that his testimony ought not to be ad∣mitted. After full argument thereupon, the judge decided this point, as follows:</P>
<P>THE question under consideration, respects the competency of a witness produced by the respon∣dent in this cause. On the one side, a general principle of law hath been urged, viz. that a per∣son interested in the event of a cause, shall not be allowed to give testimony in that cause: and, on the other, an exception to this general rule, viz. that if no further or better evidence can be had, an interested party may and ought to be heard, from the necessity of the case, his interest only affecting his credibility, not his competency. And the danger of an unhappy precedent in the rejec∣tion or admission of the witness now offered, hath been sufficiently enlarged upon on both sides. But
<PB N="108" REF="024407_0913_0FC72CF56C5238D0"/>
I cannot see the danger apprehended, since the determination in the present case, can be no rule for any other, unless the circumstances of both should be precisely similar; because, the court will always take into consideration the degree and na∣ture of the interest, that should exclude a witness under the general rule, and the reality of the ne∣cessity to admit him under the exception, and also judge of the credibility, according to circumstan∣ces. To this purpose I refer to laws of <HI>nisi prius,</HI> p. 286.
<Q>Scroggs, ch. jus. said, that it ought not to be a general rule, that members of corpo∣rations shall be admitted or denied to be witnesses, in cases for or against their corporations: but every case stands upon its own particular cir∣cumstances, viz. whether the interest be so con∣siderable as by presumption to produce partiali∣ty or not. And this exception has of late years been much extended. In the case of the <HI>King</HI> versus <HI>Bray,</HI> lord chief justice Hardwicke <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hardwicke, p. 360.</NOTE> said, that unless the objections appeared to him to carry a strong danger of perjury, and some ap∣parent advantage might accrue to the witness, he was inclined to let it go to his credit only, in order to let in a proper light to the case, which would otherwise be shut out.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="024407_0914_0FC72CFD7ADC11C8"/>IN order, therefore, to decide on the competen∣cy of the present witness, it will be necessary to take a view of the circumstances of the case, so far as they respect him, or his interest, in the cause.</P>
<P>THE ship Lady Margaret, was, by a decree of this court, condemned as prize to the captors. The marshal, after making sale of the property, advertised as usual for all persons who had any claim thereupon, to appear in person, or by agent, and receive their respective shares. <HI>Foster's</HI> agent accordingly appeared, and received his share, which was afterwards paid over to him, as appears by his receipt to the said agent. The present li∣bellants issued no prohibition to the marshal, to stay his proceedings, nor intimated any design of claiming shares in this prize. The marshal, there∣fore, went on and completed his business, with respect to this vessel and her cargo, and filed his accounts and returns, dated Feb. 1781, in the re∣gister's office; by which accounts it appears, that full distribution had been made. The present li∣bellants having recovered in the case of the brig Glocester, a prize taken by the same privateer, and in the same cruise in which the Lady Margaret was captured, now claim shares in the Lady Mar∣garet also, upon the principles of the former deci∣sion in their favour. The captain of the privateer
<PB N="110" REF="024407_0915_0FC72D020259F590"/>
hath filed his answer in opposition to this claim, and offers <HI>Foster</HI> as witness in his behalf: but it is alledged that <HI>Foster</HI> may have an interest in the event of this cause, upon a suggestion, that al∣though the marshal hath in his returns, fully ba∣lanced his accounts respecting the Lady Margaret, yet he hath done it wrongfully, by charging ex∣travagant and illegal commissions, as appears upon the very face of his returns. So that there is in fact a part of that prize yet in his hands, a distribu∣tive share of which <HI>Foster</HI> will be entitled to, if the libellants should fail in their suit, he being one of the captors of that prize.</P>
<P>IT seems then, that <HI>Foster</HI>'s interest depends upon two contingencies —First, that the libellants shall fail in their present claim: and, secondly, that the marshal shall not be able to justify the com∣missions he hath charged.</P>
<P>IF this interest depended upon the first contin∣gency only, it might be deemed too closely con∣nected with the event of this cause, to admit him as a witness of full credibility: but when the na∣ture of the second contingency is considered, viz. that it is now full two years since the marshal made his returns, and that neither Foster, nor any of the concerned, have objected to the commissions charg∣ed,
<PB N="111" REF="024407_0916_0FC72D02C916B0D0"/>
or manifested any expectations of receiving fur∣ther advantages from the Lady Margaret, his in∣terest, if any, seems to be so very remote, as not to <HI>found any reasonable presumption that it will produce partiality, or to carry a strong danger of perjury.</HI></P>
<P>THE use of testimony, is to ascertain truth, that justice may be administered. Therefore, witnesses ought not to be rejected on slight grounds of disa∣bility, or on mere suggestion of a distant interest, especially in maritime suits, where from the scene of transaction, a totally disinterested testimony can seldom be procured. But the court will always make allowance in the credit, according to the circumstances.</P>
<P>LET Foster's testimony be admitted.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="judgment">
<HEAD>JUDGMENT ON THE MERITS.</HEAD>
<P>IN order to determine this cause to my own sa∣tisfaction, I find i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> necessary to state and consider three points, which will, I apprehend, include all the principles that can affect this controversy.</P>
<P>THE <HI>first</HI> question is, Whether those who sign-the <HI>Holker's</HI> articles, after notice given that her
<PB N="112" REF="024407_0917_0FC72D0444DAA530"/>
compliment of men was full, and that no more could be received on board, and who did not go the cruise, although their not going should be oc∣casioned by a forcible rejection, ought to draw shares of all, or any of the prizes taken in that cruise?</P>
<P>It appears by the deposition of Henry Martin, the keeper of the house of rendezvous, that al∣though Fletcher, one of the Holker's officers, in∣formed many who applied that they could not be admitted, because the privateer's compliment of men was complete, and that they would be turn∣ed on shore if they came on board, yet they per∣sisted to sign the articles, and even took the ad∣vantage of the officer's turning his back to sign those articles without his knowledge, saying, they would run their chance. If any of the libellants should be found in this predicament, I shall not hesitate to dismiss their claim. Because no man ought to have an engagement forced upon him: mutual consent, expressed or implied, being ne∣cessary to every contract.</P>
<P>The <HI>second</HI> question is, Whether those who re∣gularly signed the articles, or were duly enlisted by parole-agreement before the vessel's crew was complete, and against whom no breach of duty is
<PB N="113" REF="024407_0918_0FC72D0ADFFE3750"/>
alledged, but were turned on shore against their will, and did not go the cruise, should have shares of the prize taken in that cruise.</P>
<P>BUT this point hath been so fully established in favour of the libellants, in this court and in the court of appeals, that it cannot be controverted now. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide page 55.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE <HI>third</HI> question is, Whether parties under the circumstances last mentioned, being present, and suffering the marshal to sell and distribute af∣ter public notice given, any prize or prizes in which they might have claimed an interest, with∣out filing their claim, or giving any notice to the marshal that they intend so to do, ought not to be deemed such a wilful neglect, either against the marshal, for not having reserved their shares, or against the captain, for omitting their names in the return of his crew?</P>
<P>IN clearing up this point, it may be allowed, that so long as property remains in the marshal's hands, subject to the disposal of the court, no length of time should bar a legal claimant from recovering his right.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="024407_0919_0FC72D0E68066A08"/>THE practice is, for the marshal, after he has made sale of a prize, to advertise in the pub∣lic papers for all persons having any claim there∣in, to appear by a certain day and receive their distributive shares. If, after that day, he should find any person's names in the list of the crew han∣ded to him who have not appeared in person, or by agent, he makes report thereof to the judge, who, by virtue of a law of this state, will appoint an agent for such absent persons. After which distribution is made and the accounts closed, and lodged in the register's office.</P>
<P>NOW, if any should think themselves injured by the return of the crew, inasmuch as their names have been omitted, and yet shall stand by and see the whole of the property distributed, without applying to the court or marshal for their shares, or giving any legal notice of their intention to make such a claim, it seems to be a reasonable con∣clusion that they have voluntarily abandoned their right. In the present case it is remarkable, that these very libellants brought their suit two years ago for shares in the Glocester, and recovered, and yet from that time to the present they instituted no claim for shares in the Lady Margaret, although this prize was, with respect to them, in the same predicament with the Glocester.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="024407_0920_0FC72D0FAEC18350"/>IT is very true there is no statute of limitations in the admiralty, but all things must be limited by right reason. A strong argument <HI>ab inconvenienti</HI> may supply the place and have the force of a statute. For, if there are indeed no limits, how long shall the marshal wait for claimants to come in before he shall proceed to distribution? Or if, after those who are legally entitled have re∣ceived their respective shares, they are to be for ever liable to be called upon to refund, for the sa∣tisfaction of future latent claims, when shall they presume that what they have got is really their own? But no reasonable apology can be made for those who have knowingly suffered distribution to be made without making their claim.</P>
<P>BUT it hath been suggested, and is indeed with∣in the view of the court, that some part of the monies arising from the sales of the Lady Marga∣ret and her cargo, may yet be in the hands of the late marshal. If so, I have no doubt but that such of the libellants, as fall within the description of the <HI>second</HI> point or question above stated, are entitled to their respective distributive shares thereof.</P>
<P>BY these principles I have examined the situati∣ons of the libellants respectively, which I have
<PB N="116" REF="024407_0921_0FC72D1286336ED0"/>
carefully ascertained by the articles of enlistment, and the depositions exhibited. And I find, that Charles Marmet, Thomas Ashton, Patrick Kean, James Hamilton, Patrick M'Daniel, John Craw∣ford, James Galloway, Patrick Mahoon, Peter Sherkes, William Cole, Edward Geiner, Enas M'Comer, Edward Crow, George Brand, James Murray, Benjamin Lewis, Philip Jordan, John Bla∣ney, and Felix Hughes, are justly entitled. And thereupon I adjudge and decree, that they have and receive a landsman's share each from Matthew Clarkson, late marshal, of the monies that may re∣main in his hands, from the sales of the Lady Mar∣garet and her cargo, or proportionable dividends thereof, in case there should not be sufficient to satisfy the whole.</P>
<P>AND further I adjudge, that the bill in this cause, so far as hath respect to the claims of James Barney, George Stanton Richard Fair, Charles Keasley, Joseph Ditz, and Daniel M'Far∣land, be dismissed.</P>
<P>AND lastly, I adjudge that the libellants pay the costs of this suit.</P>

<HEAD><HI>BRICE AND WOODROFF</HI> versus <HI>THE NANCY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE libellants entered on board the <HI>Nancy</HI> in January, 1783, and signed articles, acccording to custom, for a certain voyage to L'Orient, and back again to the port of Philadelphia. <HI>Brice</HI> en∣gaged to serve in the capacity of first lieutenant, and <HI>Woodroff,</HI> as surgeon, to the ship, which was an armed letter of marque. By these articles Brice was to receive £. 18 and Woodroff £ 17. per month. At this time it was war between Great Britain and the United States of America. The ship fell down the river in order to commence her voyage, but from various causes of delay, did not clear the Capes, so as to enter on the high seas, before the 20th of March following. In the mean time, viz. on the 3d of March, peace had taken place, and hostilities ceased between the bel∣ligerent powers.</P>
<P>WHEREUPON, it has been alledged in behalf of the respondents, that £. 5 per month are the
<PB N="119" REF="024407_0924_0FC72D22C710DA68"/>
customary wages in time of peace, and a full re∣compence for services for navigating a ship; that all above that sum is allowed in consideration of the risk and dangers of war. That the consi∣deration failing, and no risk being incurred, as peace had taken place before the ship had entered on the field of danger, the extraordinary wages ought to abate, and that the libellants ought to be content with peace wages for services done in time of peace.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, it has been urged, that the contract was duly and regularly made: that con∣tracts are sacred things, and ought to be taken entire, and strictly construed: that contracting par∣ties should not be admitted to explain their in∣tentions afterwards, or recede from the terms, of their bargain, on account of future contingen∣cies, provided there was no fraud in the case: that the performance of the voyage, and doing the duty on board, are the true consideration of the wages: that whether these wages are high or low is a matter that should have been considered when the contract was made: that as it cannot be sup∣posed, that if the danger had been greatly encrea∣sed by the arrival from an enemy's fleet on the coast, or from any other circumstance, the owners would have allowed encreased wages, neither
<PB N="120" REF="024407_0925_0FC72D244BA5EF00"/>
ought they to diminish the wages, because the danger happened to be lessened by the interven∣tion of peace. And lastly, that the voyage was actually commenced when the ship left the port, although she remained long after in the river.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="judgment">
<HEAD>JUDGMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE advanced wages above what is customary in time of peace is in consideration of the risk and dangers incident to war: in the present case it is clear that both parties, when they made the contract, had war in view, as is evident from the stations the libel∣lants were to fill, viz. the one, that of first lieutenant, and the other, that of surgeon of the ship, offices unknown on board of merchantmen in time of peace. Whether it would indeed be peace or war, was a circumstance out of the reach of the parties to command. Peace, however, did take place, seventeen days before any risk whatever was incurred on account of the war.</P>
<P>THE case of insurance cited from 3d Burrow's, p. 1237, is a leading case in point. The contract there was regularly made between parties, more competent to be strictly bound than common mariners, viz. the owners of a ship and the un∣der
<PB N="121" REF="024407_0926_0FC72D278A697760"/>
writers, and yet it was determimed by all the judges, that this contract ought to be liberally construed; and that the insurance premium should be returned for such part of the voyage as had ran no risk.</P>
<P>THE cause lately decided in this court, M'Cul∣loch versus Lethe, has been quoted; but there is a manifest and essential difference between that case and the present. In the former, the libellant had actually incurred the risk, had subjected him∣self to be killed in battle, or taken prisoner, which was the real consideration of the war wages pro∣mised; in the present case no risk from war was at all incurred: for, although much pains hath been taken to shew, that the captain and crew of the Nancy, not having heard of the peace, had suf∣ficient reason to think that it was war when they sailed, and conducted themselves accordingly; yet the question is not, what might have been their apprehensions, but what was the reality of the danger, or whether it was indeed war or peace at the time?</P>
<P>HAD this vessel advanced into the scene of dan∣ger, though but for twenty-four hours before peace had taken effect, I should have no doubt in allowing the libellants their full wages, accor∣ding
<PB N="122" REF="024407_0927_0FC72D2904D9AB30"/>
to the articles, upon the same principles on which wages were decreed to M'Culloch.</P>
<P>THAT the common law doctrines respecting con∣tracts do not apply in all their strictness to cases ma∣ritime is evident from the constant practice of this court. The enlistment of mariners have neither the complexion nor the formalities required by the rules of common law; and it would be hard to bind men so ignorant as common mariners generally are, to the legal construction of terms, nor would it be for the interest of mariners, that articles should be so strictly construed, as the operation would probably be frequently much against them.</P>
<P>IT appears, that when the libellants entered on board the Nancy, it was actual war, and that they held themselves in readiness to do the services, and encounter the dangers for which the stipula∣ted wages had been promised. It was not their fault that the vessel did not forthwith proceed on her voyage. I see therefore no reason against their being allowed full wages for that period, and the common usage is to allow mariners their wages from the time of signing the articles, let the vessel sail when she may.</P>
<P>I adjudge that the libellants have and receive
<PB N="123" REF="024407_0928_0FC72D33F3EE24C8"/>
their full wages, according to contract, from the time of signing the articles, to the 3d of March last; and that they receive customary peace-wages from the said 3d of March, to the completion of the voyage.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SHAW</HI> versus <HI>THE LETHE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THOMAS Shaw, the libellant, entered on board the ship <HI>Lethe,</HI> as surgeon, and contracted to serve in that capacity from Philadelphia to Bourdeaux, and back again, for the wages of £. 15 per month. It was then war, and so continued till the vessel arrived at Bourdeaux: whilst she was there in port peace took place. The libellant continued on board, and returned with the vessel to Philadel∣phia, and now demands the stipulated wages of £. 15 per month, notwithstanding the peace.</P>
<P>MUCH has been said respecting the entirety of contracts on the one hand, and the divisibility
<PB N="124" REF="024407_0929_0FC72D35D1510F48"/>
of contracts, particularly those of insurance and mercantile agreements, on the other.</P>
<P>IT has been urged for the libellant, that the voyage to Bourdeaux and back again, must be con∣sidered as one entire voyage; and that if this vessel had been insured, or chartered, there could have been no apportionment of the premium or hire on account of the peace.</P>
<P>AGAINST this doctrine, the case of <HI>Stephenson</HI> versus <HI>Snow,</HI> 3d Bur. 1237, has been cited, and ful∣ly considered. The case was—a ship was insured for a certain premium, to sail from London to Halifax; the insured warranting that she should sail with convoy from Portsmouth. She arrived at Ports∣mouth, but the convoy was gone. Whereupon a return of premium was demanded, deducting only the customary insurance from London to Portsmouth. The entirety of contracts was here urged against the insurers, but over-ruled by the whole court, who considered the contract as divisi∣ble, and having reference to two distinct voyages, viz. from London to Portsmouth, and from thence to Halifax; and determined that as the risk of the second voyage had never been begun, the premi∣um for that had never inured.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="024407_0930_0FC72D37744783B0"/>THIS case appeared at first view to apply close∣ly to the present; but, on a nearer inspection, I find that the warrantee to sail with convoy was the ground of that decision. It was that alone which rendered the voyage divisible, because it was of the essence of the contract. Had the ship sailed without, and been lost, the insurers would not have been answerable. Had she been insured from London to Halifax, without any condition annexed, and had stopped in her way at Ports∣mouth, and proceeded no further, the voyage would not, I apprehend, have been deemed divi∣sible on that account, nor the premium appor∣tioned; so that the warrantee to sail with convey was the foundation of the contract, which fai∣ling, the contract failed, so far as the same had respect thereto. The voyage from London to Portsmouth seems to be no more than a necessary passage to the place where the substantial part of the contract was to take effect; where the premi∣um was to be earned by the commencement of the risk under the condition specified.</P>
<P>BUT I find nothing parallel with this in the ar∣ticles of the ship Lethe: no contingency mention∣ed; but only a simple contract for a voyage to Bour∣deaux and back again, in consideration of certain
<PB N="126" REF="024407_0931_0FC72D42846D3D60"/>
services to be performed on the one part, and cer∣tain wages to be paid on the other. If there is any similarity in the two cases, it consists in this: that, as in the one, the sailing with convoy was the ground of the <HI>quantum</HI> of the premium; so in the other, the war was the ground of the <HI>quantum</HI> of wages. In the case referred to, the contingen∣cy was fully recognized in the contract: the ship was warranted to sail with convoy, but no con∣tingencies are provided for in the Lethe's articles. If the insured vessel had sailed with the convoy, though but for one day, and returned, it cannot be supposed that any part of the premium would have been restored.</P>
<P>THAT the mere arrival of a vessel at a port or ports cannot be construed as a division of the voy∣age delineated by the articles, is manifest from a current of law and practice: so it was determined in the case of Bernon <HI>versus</HI> Woodbridge, Douglas, 753, and numberless charter parties, insurances, and articles for mariner's wages have reference to circuitous voyages. Nor was it understood, that a fortuitous increase or diminution of the risk, or any alteration of circumstances between one port of destination and another, would affect the con∣tract, unless provided for by the terms of the agreement.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="024407_0932_0FC72D47DB883F90"/>BUT it hath been strongly urged, that the high wages promised, and the nature of the service to be performed, have reference to war only; and that as peace took place whilst the vessel was safe in port, the voyage, from the manifest object of the contract, became divisible: and that it would be very hard to bind the master or owners to the most severe construction of the articles, and make them pay for services, which, from an unforeseen change of affairs, were rendered im∣practicable.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH there is an equitable force in this argument, yet, under the circumstances of the case, there seems to have been an obvious duty on the part of the master to have entitled him to an equitable relief from the binding force of the arti∣cles. He should have proposed to pay off the crew at Bourdeaux, and tendered a new contract on peace establishment, protesting against the for∣mer articles. Nor is this a mere ceremony, but what substantial justice seems to require. The mariners, under the articles, could not leave the ship without incurring a penalty. If then they are detained on board without any explanation, not∣withstanding the great change of circumstances, they had sufficient reason to conclude, that they were continued in the service upon the terms of
<PB N="128" REF="024407_0933_0FC72D494E41D378"/>
the subsisting contract: and this reasoning will well apply if the case be reversed. Suppose the mari∣ner had engaged in time of peace, and war had broke out during the voyage, and he had made no declaration that he was dissatisfied with the terms of his contract, or expected war wages in consi∣deration of the risk he was to run, I believe there are few masters of vessels who would not urge his silence as an acquiescence in the continuation of the contract, and bind him down to the terms of the original contract.</P>
<P>IT is so natural to expect some declaration of the will of contracting parties, when circumstances out of the reach of either have occurred, which totally alters the principles upon which the con∣tract was formed, that an omission of such decla∣ration can have no other interpretation, but that of wilful neglect or deep design, neither of which is the law disposed to countenance. Hence, pro∣bably, arose the custom of protests, in cases of wreck, illegal capture, fire, and other unforeseen and unavoidable accidents.</P>
<P>ONE other argument hath been urged for the respondents, viz. that freight is the mother of wa∣ges; inferring, that as this vessel received only
<PB N="129" REF="024407_0934_0FC72D4B04955AE8"/>
peace freight from Bourdeaux to Philadelphia, no more than peace wages ought to be allowed for that part of the voyage.</P>
<P>IT does not appear in testimony what freight this vessel received: but if it did, I see no force in the argument. There is, in fact, no connexion be∣tween freight and the quantum of wages; nor are the mariners ever privy to the terms on which a cargo hath been shipped. It is only a law of po∣licy which arbitrarily makes the payment (not the rate per month) of the wages to depend on the safe conduct of the cargo, in order to induce the mariners to exert themselves in case of wreck, to save as much as possible, knowing, that if the whole be lost, they must lose the whole of their wages. If the freight is thus called the mother, the service performed may well be deemed the father, of the mariner's wages, that being the real and legal con∣sideration. There is no doubt but the mariner shall have his wages, in cases where no freight at all is received; as in vessels sailing with ballast on∣ly, which often happens. The truth is, the mari∣ner's lien is on the ship, and not on the cargo. Nor, was it ever known, that freight could be attached in the merchant's hands to answer for mariner's
<PB N="130" REF="024407_0935_0FC72D53544AA420"/>
wages, but the ship is liable uoder all circum∣stances.</P>
<P>I have not noticed the ship's going to Teneriffe from Bourdeaux before she came to Philadelphia, as this circumstance, if it has any operation at all, must be against the master, who ought not to bene∣fit by his own deviation from the articles.</P>
<P>AFTER mature consideration, I cannot find suffi∣cient reason to give a different decision now, from what was lately given in the case of M'Culloch, against the same ship. The continuation of the libellant on board, after it was known that peace had taken place, without any declaration of the master, that he expected the terms of the contract should be changed, is too strong a circumstance to be got over.</P>
<P>BUT, as I think it a hard case, I would recom∣mend an appeal; that the law and arguments may be again considered by another court.</P>

<HEAD>SILAS TALBOT versus THE OWNERS OF THE BRIGS ACHILLES, PATTY, AND HIBERNIA.</HEAD>
<P>IN September, 1779, Silas Talbot, being on a cruise in the sloop Argo, discovered, and pursued the brig Betsey, a British letter of marque, about 200 tons burthen, armed with 8 six pounders, and laden with 214 puncheons of rum, and one quar∣ter cask, and bound from Montserrat or St. Chris∣topher's, to New York, then in the possession of the enemy. After an engagement of two hours, Talbot captured the Betsey; put one West on board, as prize master, together with eleven of his crew, with written orders to the prize master to take her into the port of New London, then not far distant, for condemnation.</P>
<P>THE next day after the capture, the three brigs, Achilles, Patty, and Hibernia, belonging to the respondents in this cause, came up with the Betsey,
<PB N="133" REF="024407_0938_0FC72D5AA3343500"/>
under British colours. Captain Talbot taking them for enemies, was obliged to leave his prize, and fly: whereupon one of the three brigs chased the Argo, whilst the Patty fired upon, boarded, and captured the Betsey.</P>
<P>WEST, the prize master, finding them to be Americans, declared that the Betsey was a prize of captain Talbot, in the Argo, then in sight, and shewed Talbot's written orders to him: but for fear of their claiming shares of the prize, as hav∣ing been in sight when she was captured, asserted, that she had been taken three days before. The persons who boarded the Betsey having seen a bat∣tle the day before, between a brig and a sloop, which they believed to be the same; and observ∣ing that the number of men on board, correspond∣ed with the number registered in her British pa∣pers, concluded that no credit should be given to West's declaration. Whereupon, a consultation was held by the three captains,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">According to W— D—'s deposition.</NOTE> who finally made prize of the Betsey, took out all the Argo's men, except one negro, and putting their own people on board, ordered her for Philadelphia. But she was soon after captured by a British cruiser,
<PB N="134" REF="024407_0939_0FC72D6292777290"/>
and carried into New York—and so lost to all parties. The three brigs pursued their respective voyages; taking the Argo's men with them, whom they left in Spain, and other remote parts.</P>
<P>THE respondents have rested their defence on two grounds of argument: <HI>First,</HI> they alledge, that they have produced sufficient testimony to prove that the brigs Achilles, Patty, and Hiber∣nia, were within sight, when the Argo engaged and captured the Betsey, and acquired thereby a property in the prize, according to the maritime law: inferring, that as their interest in the booty was much greater than that of the Argo, they be∣ing three to one, they had a right to order the prize where they judged best for their security and benefit; more especially as they had reason to doubt the fidelity of West, in whose possession they found her, on account of the falshood he had told them: concluding, that if any injury was done to the libellant, it only amounted to his pro∣portionable share of the booty, for which alone they ought to be answerable. <HI>Secondly,</HI> that ma∣ny suspicious circumstances on board the Betsey— such as the British papers, the number of men on board agreeing therewith, and the declaration of West, that she had been captured three days be∣fore,
<PB N="135" REF="024407_0940_0FC72D670D1BA2F8"/>
contrary to their own observation, were suffi∣cient to induce them to conclude that the whole was an artifice; and, therefore, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were justifia∣ble in taking her as original prize, and to consider themselves as the first captors.</P>
<P>THESE two positions of defence are supported by the testimony of W— D—, a passenger on board the Patty. This deposition, on which alone the respondents have relied, labours for the establishment of two facts which are altogether incompatible with each other, viz. first, that the three brigs saw the Argo engage and capture the Betsy; and, secondly, that the Betsy had not been captured at all, or, at least, that the captains of the three brigs had good reason to think so, and were justifiable in taking her as ori∣ginal prize. One only of these positions can be true: therefore, a testimony which labours to establish both, may, at least, be said to prove too much.</P>
<P>THE fact best supported by the circumstances seems to be, that the three brigs were in sight of the battle between the Argo and Betsy. What then was their conduct in this point of view? The next day after the engagement, of which
<PB N="136" REF="024407_0941_0FC72D6804A57400"/>
they had been distant spectators, they come up under British colours; they find the Betsy in the possession, and under the protection of the Ar∣go, her captor; they chase away the Argo, and fire on the prize under British colours; they board her; take out all the people placed on board by captain Talbot; man her with part of their own crews; give her in charge to their own prize-master, and order her for Philadelphia. Could their having been in sight, the day before, of the engagement between the Argo and the Bet∣sy, justify such a procedure? Surely it could not. Besides, it is manifest, that the rule of law respect∣ing vessels in sight of a capture does not refer to what may have been seen by the claimants, but by people on board the prize: for the rule is founded on a presumption, that the crew of the captured vessel, seeing others coming up armed and prepared for battle, were thereby induced to surrender.</P>
<P>FURTHER, I can on no account admit the doc∣trine, now for the first time advanced, and unsup∣ported by any authority whatever, that captains, claiming a share in the prize they may have seen captured, have a right to order the booty where they please, by virtue of a majority of votes, or
<PB N="137" REF="024407_0942_0FC72D6986D5AA10"/>
of their superior interest in the captured property. Their claim must follow, and depend upon the success of the real captor. Besides, in the present case, the libellant who fought for, and alone took the brig Betsey, had at least some right in the prize: the captains of the three brigs the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>efore, ought in justice, to have left his prize-ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er on board to prosecute the Argo's claim, which was not done.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, this seems to have been an act of such unjustifiable violence and wrong, on the part of the brigs Achilles, Patty, and H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bernia, that I am clear in deciding in favour of the libel∣lant in this cause. And, having carefully ascertain∣ed the value of the property lost, I find that a brig of 200 tuns, mounting eight six-pounders, with her tackel, apparel, furniture, and prov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sions on board, was, in October 1779, worth

<HEAD>DEAN, AND OTHERS, versus JOHN ANGUS CAPTAIN OF THE HIBERNIA</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Judgment on a Plea to the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty.</HEAD>
<P>IN a former suit in this court, <HI>Silas Tabot</HI> libel∣led and recovered against Deans, Purviance, and Harbeson, as owners of the brigantine Hibernia, and also against certain other persons, respondents in that cause, for a wrongful capture on the high seas. From the decree in that cause, an appeal was made to the high court of errors and appeals for this commonwealth, where a judgement was finally obtained against the said respondents, to a considerable amount. And now, Dean Purvi∣ance, and Harbeson, owners of the Hibernia libel against John Angus, their captain, for satisfaction of the damages they have sustained, in conse∣quence of the wrongful capture he had made.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="024407_0945_0FC72D75A83D9708"/>TO this libel, <HI>Angus</HI> hath filed for answer, a denial of the wrong done, and a plea to the ju∣risdiction of this court in the present cause:
<Q>For this, viz. that the contract between the said li∣bellants, and him the said Angus, and also the damage alledged to be sustained by the said li∣bellants, if any there be, arose upon the land, to wit, in Philadelphia, in the county of Phi∣delphia.</Q></P>
<P>THREE acknowledged principles of law natu∣rally present for the solution of the present que∣stion.</P>
<P N="1">1st. WHERE the original cause of action is <HI>ex∣clusively</HI> of admiralty, or <HI>exclusively</HI> of common law jurisdiction, all incidental matters necessarily flowing from or dependant upon the first cause of action, shall follow the original jurisdiction, what∣ever the complexion of those matters, separately considered, may be.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. WHERE the original cause of action is partly of common law, and partly of admiralty jurisdiction, the common law shall be preferred.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. WHERE the jurisdictions are concurrent, the suit may be determined in either.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="024407_0946_0FC72D7E4A717E10"/>TO one or other of these principles must the pre∣sent case apply: to ascertain the jurisdiction by which it is to be tried, and the propriety of the application depends upon this sole question, What is the original cause of action in this suit?</P>
<P>IT is alledged in support of the plea, that this is a <HI>new</HI> action between the owners of a vessel and their captain, and hath no necessary connexion with the suit brought by Silas Talbot: that it is enough, if the respondent shews that the decree past against the libellants, not as principals in the wrongful capture, but solely on account of the maritime law, which makes owners answerable for the mis∣conduct of the captains they employ; and there∣fore their connexion with Angus, as captain of the Hibernia, must be considered as the true cause of the damage they say they have sustain∣ed, and the source from which the present suit originates. And so infer, that as this connexion is grounded on a contract express or implied, made upon land, the original cause of action must, from its nature and locality, be <HI>exclusively</HI> of common law jurisdiction.</P>
<P>THE two criterions of exclusive jurisdiction are, the <HI>subject matter,</HI> and the <HI>locality</HI> of the transaction.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="024407_0947_0FC72D801AE19B68"/>IT is not doubted, but that the question, <HI>prize or no prize?</HI> when it is the foundation of a suit, is <HI>exclusively</HI> of admiralty cognizance from the <HI>subject matter.</HI> The authorities to this point are too pre∣cise to admit of doubt. But some of these autho∣rities go further; and say, that the mere taking <HI>as prize,</HI> and all matters dependant thereupon, are also peculiarly of admiralty jurisdiction. Ld. Ch. Jus. Lee's opinion, in the case of Rous versus Has∣sard, as cited by Lord Mansfield, and again cited by justice Willis, in the case of Le. Caux versus Eden. Douglass, 581, is full to this purpose.
<Q>The great question was, Whether an action for trespass would lie for taking a ship as a prize? Lord chief justice <HI>Lee,</HI> having called in two civilians to his assistance, delivered the opinion of the court. That though, for taking a ship on the seas, tresspass would lie at common law, yet when it was taken <HI>as prize,</HI> though ta∣ken wrongfully, though it were acquitted, and though <HI>there was no colour for</HI> the taking, the judge of the admiralty was judge of the dama∣ges and costs, as well as of the principal mat∣ter: and he laid it down as law, that, if such an action was brought in England, and the defen∣dant <HI>not guilty,</HI> the plaintiff could not recover.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="024407_0948_0FC72D81912BA528"/>IT is clear by this authority, that in order to fix the admiralty jurisdiction, it is not necessary that the question before the court should precise∣ly be, <HI>prize or no prize?</HI> but that a suit for costs and damages may and must be brought in the ad∣miralty for a taking <HI>as prize,</HI> though wrongfully done, and even without any colour for such ta∣king, and, as it should seem from the case, even though the property so taken should not be in the possession of the court.</P>
<P>SO also, in the case of Lindo versus <HI>Rodney</HI> and <HI>Vaughan</HI> (Douglass, 592.) Lord Mansfield, in giving the opinion of the court, says:
<Q>A thing being done upon the high seas, does not exclude the jurisdiction of the common law; for seizing, stopping, or taking a ship upon the high seas, <HI>not as prize,</HI> an action will lie, but for taking <HI>as prize,</HI> no action will lie. The nature of the question excludes not the locality.</Q>
And a little further on—
<Q>The end of prize-court is to suspend the property till condemnation, <HI>and to punish every sort of misbehaviour in the cap∣tors.</HI></Q></P>
<P>HOW it came to pass that the case of Silas Tal∣bot was, by the court of errors and appeals, and still is, by concession of council in the present
<PB N="144" REF="024407_0949_0FC72D8A2F06F4A8"/>
cause, considered to be <HI>not</HI> of admirality juris∣diction on account of the <HI>subject matter,</HI> I am at a loss to conceive; especially when I look at the two only points of defence taken in that cause, viz. first, that from the papers found on board the captured vessel, and from other concomitant circumstances, there was a reasonable colour for <HI>taking as original prize.</HI> And, secondly, that if the Betsy was indeed prize to Silas Talbot, the three brigs were in sight at the time of the cap∣ture, and by the maritime law, acquired thereby an interest in the property. I say, these pleas, to∣gether with the current of the testimony then ex∣hibited, and the time of the transaction, being time of war, all united in fixing that cause within the admiralty jurisdiction, from the subject mat∣ter, and the very nature of the case.</P>
<P>IT is in obedience to strong conviction that I thus venture to differ in opinion from the judgment of the honourable court of errors and appeals: a judgment which I am inclined to believe would not have taken place, but for the peculiar situation of Talbot's cause. The court of appeals for the United States, in prize-causes, had rejected the appeal, because the
<PB N="145" REF="024407_0950_0FC72D8C0923AD08"/>
question was not strictly, <HI>prize or no prize?</HI> but an action for damages between citizen and citi∣zen. That court, as I have understood, looked at that cause in no other point of view, and there∣fore refused to take cognizance of it, and soon after was dissolved. The appeal was then car∣ried to the high court of errors and appeals for this commonwealth. Here the proctors had made a previous agreement, not to contest the point of jurisdiction; and so the cause came be∣fore the judges on the merits only, and the court proceeded to sentence without suspecting their jurisdiction. After sentence, however, some of the judges began to entertain scruples respect∣ing the jurisdiction of the court; and, on enquiry, found that the jurisdiction had only been submit∣ted to by consent. The court well knew that consent could not give legal jurisdiction; and there∣upon retracted or suspended the sentence until an argument should be held on that point: and the question of jurisdiction was again agitated. In the mean time, that is between the rejection of the cause by the court of appeals for the United States, and its introduction into the court of the commonwealth, the case of Le Caux versus Eden, as reported by Douglass, with Lord Mansfield's dissertion on admiralty jurisdiction subjoined, made
<PB N="146" REF="024407_0951_0FC72D8D8AF29CC0"/>
their first appearance amongst us, and furnished new ideas respecting the court of admiralty. Then, for the first time, did the distinction occur, between the <HI>prize</HI>-court and the <HI>instance</HI>-court of admiralty. Possessed of this idea, the judges of appeal for the state, looked at the proceedings which the court of admiralty had adopted in the case before them, and found they had been <HI>in personam,</HI> by attachment, to answer for damages arising from a tort committed at sea. This, it was observed, was never the practice in the <HI>prize</HI>-court, which always proceeded <HI>in rem,</HI> by procla∣mation and monition, whether the property be in fact in the possession of the court or not: and so it was in the case of the king versus Broom, <HI>Carth.</HI> 398. by proclamation at the Royal Ex∣change, although the prize taken had been previ∣ously sold at Barbadoes. And for this error of form in the admiralty, <HI>Talbot's</HI> case was considered as belonging to the <HI>instance</HI>-court. The judges of apppeal considered themselves as an <HI>instance</HI>-court of appeal, and so proceded to the definitive de∣cree.</P>
<P>HAD the court of admiralty, when Talbot's cause first made its appearance there, been possess∣ed of the light which hath been since thrown up∣on
<PB N="147" REF="024407_0952_0FC72D98DCFBD878"/>
this subject, it is very probable that the process would have been conducted otherwise than it was. It should be observed, however, that an <HI>exclusive</HI> jurisdiction cannot be subverted by an erroneous process.</P>
<P>HOW far the consideration, that if the court of appeals for the commonwealth should reject Tal∣bot's cause (as the court for the United States had done) the appellants would have had no other re∣source, and so have been deprived of the benefit of an appeal altogether, might have operated to induce the judges to take that within their cogni∣zance as an <HI>instance</HI>-court, I will not presume to say; but the peculiar circumstances of the case ought to be remembered: and I have mentioned them on this occasion from a sense of the duty I owe to the jurisdiction entrusted to my care.</P>
<P>I come now to consider the origin of the cause now before me, and whether it is, or is not, neces∣sarily dependant upon, and consequential to, the case of Silas Talbot.</P>
<P>IT has been said, that this suit is derived from three circumstances, viz. the contract by which Angus was made captain of the Hibernia, the wrongful taking at sea, and the damages the li∣bellants
<PB N="148" REF="024407_0953_0FC72D9B33718E40"/>
have been obliged to pay in consequence of this contract and wrongful taking. And it has been urged, that as two of these circumstances viz. the contract and the payment of damages, happened on the land, the common law, by the second general rule, hath the exclusive jurisdiction.</P>
<P>IT appears to me, however, that owners are answerable for torts done by the captains they employ, under a general principle of law, and not by virtue of any special contract whatever. No such responsibility can be deduced from any articles, or failing orders given to captains of vessels. The contract may be the ground of an action of da∣mages for a breach of orders, respecting the par∣ticular interests of the owners; but in cases of tort the owners are answerable by a general law. The libellants have been obliged to pay the dama∣ges in Talbot's case, not because they employed captain Angus, but because they were owners of the brigs.</P>
<P>NEITHER can I consider the payment of mo∣nies, according to the decree in favour of Silas Talbot, as the origin of the present suit. We should not stop short in the train of causes. In such a train, every circumstance is the effect of the preceding and the cause of the subsequent link. No decree
<PB N="149" REF="024407_0954_0FC72DA049FC59C8"/>
would have past, no damages have been paid, nor would the present suit have been instituted, but for the original wrong done at sea. To this wrong, therefore, we must have recourse for the source of the present action.</P>
<P>SOME pains have been taken to apply the case of ransom bills, charter parties, and policies of insurance, all sueable at common law, to the pre∣sent suit. A ransom bill supposes a divesture of property by the rights of war, and the bill is a promissory note for a certain sum, in considera∣tion of the victor's relinquishing his right of con∣quest, and restoring the property. In a suit, therefore, on a ransom bill, the question of <HI>prize or no prize</HI> can only come in incidentally, to shew whether there was value received or not. For if the taking was wrongful, the property never di∣vested, and of course the promissory bill was gi∣ven without consideration. Charter parties, and policies of insurance, are written contracts, execu∣ted on land, respecting certain specific contingen∣cies: it is immaterial where these contingencies shall happen. The suit is founded on the bind∣ing force of the contract, and the contingencies are only incidental circumstances, shewing that the force of the contract is to take place and ope∣rate. But these are not parallel with the case
<PB N="150" REF="024407_0955_0FC72DA20CCBAA50"/>
before the court, wherein the libellants complain of damages they have sustained in consequence of a tort committed at sea by the captain they had employed.</P>
<P>WHEN the case of Silas Talbot came first be∣fore this court, the libel was filed in the name of Silas Talbot, <HI>qui tam,</HI> against the brigs Achilles, Patty, and Hibernia, and against certain persons in the said libel named, as owners and captains of the said brigs. All these persons (except two, if I rightly remember) appeared either in person or by proxy, and entered into stipulations, according to the practice of the court. In this form the suit commenced, and proceeded through the admiralty, and through the court of appeals. The question was general in both courts, viz. Whether there had been a wrong done? and if so, whether the parties who appeared as respondents to the libel, were answerable for the damage, and to what amount? And, finally, the decree was also general—That the appellants should pay to the appellee certain monies in recompence of the injury sustained. But how far any particular captain, or the owners of any particular vessel might have justified themselves by a separate defence, was never the subject of en∣quiry. No such specific justification having been proffered in either court. And whether it is, or is
<PB N="151" REF="024407_0956_0FC72DAD5B923E28"/>
not now too late, to make discrimination, may be the subject of future discussion: but I mention this to shew, that the present libel rises out of Talbot's case, and that its pursuit will unavoidably force us up to the wrongful taking <HI>as prize</HI> for the origin of the present suit. Since then, I cannot but con∣sider the case of Silas Talbot, as properly belong∣ing to the <HI>prize</HI>-court of admiralty, and that the present suit originates from, and is a supplementary part of that transaction, I cannot (according to the first principle stated) but over-rule the present plea to the jurisdiction of this court.</P>
<P>I conclude with this observation—That in all pleas of this kind, where the law is doubtful, the leaning of the court will be in favour of its own jurisdiction—not from a desire of extending the admiralty cognizance, but for this consideration— That if the decision in favour of the jurisdiction should be erroneous, the doors of the common law are open for redress, and a prohibition may be obtained. But there is no remedy for the er∣roneous exclusion of parties who apply for the process of the admiralty, the benefit of the laws by which it is governed, and the summary justice it affords.</P>

<HEAD>DEAN, AND OTHERS, versus JOHN ANGUS. JUDGMENT ON THE MERITS.</HEAD>
<P>THE bill filed in this case states, "That John Angus, being commander of the brig Hibernia, belonging to Joseph Dean and others, did, on a certain day, without any licence, order, or autho∣rity, from his owners, and without any probable cause of capture, with a view to his own private interest and emolument, combine and confederate with certain malefactors, and did pursue and take the brigantine Betsey, then in the possession of Silas Talbot, commander of the sloop Argo, as lawful prize and booty of war. And that the said John Angus, not being ignorant of the pre∣mises aforesaid, but well knowing the same, and intending to deprive the said Silas Talbot of his prize, and to defraud and injure, as much as in
<PB N="153" REF="024407_0958_0FC72DB487AE3B78"/>
him lay, his owners, the libellants in this cause, did cause the brigantine Betsey to be sent to places unknown, &amp;c. whereby she was lost, &amp;c."— "That for this cause, the said Silas Talbot did afterwards file his bill in this court against the said John Angus, and against his owners, the present libellants, and also against certain other persons, in the said bill named, for the wrong and injury done; and did, by the sentence and decree of this court, recover against them the sum of £. 12,700:5:0 damages, with costs of suit. Whereupon, an ap∣peal was entered to the honourable the high court of errors and appeals for this commonwealth; in the prosecution and final issue whereof, the said Silas Talbot did recover against the appellants the sum of £. 11,141:5:4; of which sum the li∣libellants in this cause were compelled, and did actually pay, the sum of £. 4000: and also that they had expended the further sum of £. 450, in defending themselve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> against the bill of the said Silas Talbot, and in the prosecution of their said appeal. Whereupon, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w pray judgment against the said John Angus▪ for reparation of the damage and loss they have so sustained."</P>
<P>I have found it necessary to the determination of
<PB N="154" REF="024407_0959_0FC72DB606442428"/>
the present question, to consider it under the three following points of view, viz.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> How far the cause now before the court may be considered as connected with, or determi∣ned by the decree in the case of Silas Talbot.</P>
<P><HI>Second,</HI> UNDER what circumstances owners of vessels ought to recover against the captains they employ for damages suffered in consequence of their misconduct.</P>
<P><HI>Third,</HI> THE specific circumstances of the present case, as they stand on the testimony, or what is called the merits of the cause.</P>
<P>AS to the first point—I can see no connection between this cause, and the case of Silas Talbot, further than this; that as it originates in the same transaction, viz. <HI>a taking as prize on the high seas,</HI> the jurisdiction is thereby determined. In all other respects the two causes proceed on different prin∣ciples—The points in view in Talbot's case were —how far owners of vessels were answerable for torts committed by the captains they employ? and whether the <HI>taking</HI> in question was in fact such a tort as they ought to be answerable for? The ob∣jects in the present case are—Under what circum∣stances
<PB N="155" REF="024407_0960_0FC72DC34897F380"/>
owners may recover against their captains, and whether captain Angus was, or was not, <HI>parti∣ceps criminis</HI> with the wrong doers in Talbot's case.</P>
<P>THE complexion of the two causes being thus manifestly different, it cannot, with any reason, be admitted, that the testimony or decree, founded thereupon in the former, should be conclusive in the present case. The decree, in Talbot's case, was against certain persons, who by stipulations, had made themselves responsible for the issue of that suit on general principles. It is not inconsis∣tent with the record of that decree, for captain Angus, who was not one of those stipulants, and who was no party in that suit, to come in now and make his defence, when personally called upon to answer, and to shew that he was not one of the wrong doers, <HI>against whom</HI> that decree was ob∣tained.</P>
<P>ON the second point, viz.—Under what circum∣stances owners of vessels ought to recover against the captains they employ, for damages suffered in consequence of their misconduct? It is consonant with reason and authority, that captains are not answerable for losses arising from unavoidable ac∣cidents,
<PB N="156" REF="024407_0961_0FC72DC50AA6A770"/>
mere errors of judgment, or failure of success, after having exercised all reasonable dili∣gence and discretion. It would be very difficult, and at present unnecessary to delineate the particu∣lar circumstances and kinds of misconduct, which should render a captain responsible to his owners. Every case that occurs must be judged of, by its own peculiar circumstances. The present libel states, "That John Angus did, without any au∣thority from his owners, combine with certain malefactors, and without probable cause of cap∣ture, take the brig Betsey, then in the possession of Silas Talbot, as prize and booty of war: and that he did this, not ignorantly, but well knowing the circumstances, and with a view to injure the said Silas Talbot, and also his owners, as much as in him lay." If these charges are supported by testimony now before the court, there can be no doubt, but that he ought to be answerable to his owners for whatever they have suffered by his misconduct.</P>
<P>AND this leads to the third point, viz.—The consideration of the specific circumstances of the case, as exhibited by the testimony, or the merits of the cause.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="024407_0962_0FC72DC6AC4D4F00"/>THE facts, so far as they respect captain Angus, appear to be in substance these:</P>
<P>ANGUS sailed on a trading voyage from Phila∣delphia to Teneriffe, in the armed letter of marque brig, <HI>Hibernia,</HI> in company with the brigs <HI>Patty</HI> and <HI>Achilles,</HI> also letters of marque, and bound to some ports in Europe, under the commands of captains <HI>Prole</HI> and <HI>Thompson.</HI> Angus had receiv∣ed written instructions from his owners (the pre∣sent libellants) to keep company with the two brigs as long as he should think it prudent, and had their approbation to cruise with them on the coast for two or three weeks, if they should so agree. Be∣ing at Reedy Island, in the Delaware, a consulta∣tion was held between the three captains, and Prole was appointed commodore of this little squa∣dron. Soon after they had got out to sea, they discovered a brig and a sloop at a distance. Prole, as commodore, gave orders to chase, which was done. Prole and Thompson, under British co∣lours, came up with, and took the brig, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the Hibernia, being a dull sailor, was left four or five miles astern. When she came up, captain Angus enquired what the captured vessel was, and was informed by Prole, or Thompson, that she was a good prize, bound from Montserat to New York. To which Angus replied, that if the brig was prize, the sloop (then in sight) must be
<PB N="158" REF="024407_0963_0FC72DD459DFD338"/>
so too: and asked why one of their fast sailing brigs did not pursue her? To which it was an∣swered, that they did not choose to leave the prize till she was well manned; but ordered him to chase the sloop, which he accordingly did, for two or three leagues; but finding he could not come up with her, he hawled his wind, and beat up again for the other brigs, but did not reach them till dark. Prole then sent a boat to Angus, de∣manding two of his hands to man the prize, for∣warding, at the same time, a paper for Angus to sign, which appears to have been orders drawn up by Prole, and signed by him and Thompson, for the prize-master, to whose charge they had com∣mitted the captured brig. Angus hastily signed this paper on the binnacle, and sent the two men required. The wind then blowing fresh, the sea running high, and night coming on, the four brigs separated and saw each other no more.</P>
<P>FROM this detail, it is manifest, that Angus had no opportunity of acquiring information of those circumstances which were the ground of condemna∣tion against the respondents in the suit of Si∣las Talbot. The assurance of Prole, the com∣modore, that the Betsey was good prize, was, in the then situation of affairs, sufficient to convince Angus that there was at least probable cause of capture. And if the enterprize had been a suc∣cessful
<PB N="159" REF="024407_0964_0FC72DD6B615B018"/>
one, which he had no reason to doubt, An∣gus would not have been justifiable in neglecting any thing on his part to secure to his owners a share of the Betsey taken, or to add thereto, by endeavouring to take the sloop also.</P>
<P>THE only circumstance which hath a direct ten∣dency to criminate captain Angus, is his signing the orders to the prize-master put on board the Betsey, directing to "keep to the southward, for fear of falling in with the Argo:" There are two ways in which this may very naturally be account∣ed for, neither of which are in the least contra∣dicted by the testimony, viz, that in the hurry of the transaction, the boat waiting along side, the sea rough, and night coming on, he signed these or∣ders without reading them, having confidence in those who had drawn them up and signed before him; or, according to his last conclusion, "if the brig was prize, the sloop must be so too," he still conceived the Argo to be an enemy, and therefore to be avoided by the prize-master.</P>
<P>BUT, without having recourse to surmises, I am clearly of opinion that the libel is not supported by the testimony; that is, there is not sufficient proof that the respondent "did wilfully and knowing∣ly, and without probable cause of capture, join
<PB N="160" REF="024407_0965_0FC72DDB543A3518"/>
with others, in taking from Silas Talbot his prize and booty of war."</P>
<P>IT is manifest, indeed, from the records of the court of appeals, that the libellants have suffered considerable damage in consequence of this trans∣action at sea. But, as they had embarked them∣selves in a suit with real wrong-doers, and suffer∣ed judgment to go against them on general princi∣ples, without attempting any separate defence, this is no reason why Angus should not bring for∣ward such specific testimony with regard to his own conduct as may exculpate him from the charges laid in the present libel.</P>
<P>SOME stress has been laid on a passage in the deposition of W— D—, exhibited in Tal∣bot's cause, tending to prove that Angus was not so ignorant of the circumstances respecting the Bet∣sey and Argo, as he pretends. The passage is in these words: "Afterwards, captains Prole, An∣gus, and Thompson, in the presence of this de∣ponent, consulted what they should do with the brig Betsey, and being of opinion," &amp;c. What∣ever weight this deposition might have had in Tal∣bot's cause, it is inadmissible in the present; but I would observe that this circumstance is not sup∣ported by any other testimony on the records of
<PB N="161" REF="024407_0966_0FC72DDC46D509E8"/>
this court: on the contrary, from the general his∣tory of the transaction, there seems to have been no period of time in which Angus could have left his vessel, or the other captains have been on board the Hibernia to hold this consultation; W— D— must therefore have been mistaken. In∣deed this is not the only circumstance in which he is singular. For just before, he says, "The brigs Achilles and Hibernia endeavoured to speak her (meaning the Argo) but could not come up with her. And, upon the said Churche's saying, that cap∣tain Talbot was not a man that would run from <HI>one</HI> of them if they would not both chase, the brig Achilles then chased alone."</P>
<P>NOW, the whole current of testimony agrees in this, that it was the Hibernia and not the Achilles that chased the Argo. And as I remember, in some stage of Talbot's suit, it was urged as an ag∣gravating circumstance against the owners of the Hibernia, that their captain was employed in driv∣ing off the Argo, whilst her confederates were plundering her prize.</P>
<P>THESE observations on W— D—'s depo∣sition cannot directly affect the present question, because that deposition is not an exhibit in this cause; but I mention them, because if I could find
<PB N="162" REF="024407_0967_0FC72DE6788694C0"/>
any substantial ground that Angus was indeed <HI>par∣ticeps criminis</HI> with Prole and Thompson, or that he knew, or had any opportunity of knowing, the circumstances which should have prohibited them from making that unfortunate capture, I should not be so clear as I now am in adjudging</P>
<P>THAT the bill in this cause be dismissed, and that the libellants pay the costs of suit.</P>
<P>THE libellants; appealed and after long argu∣ment, the court adjudged in June 1785, that John Angus should pay to the appellants, £. 948:15:10, with interest thereon, from the 22d day of Janua∣ry 1785.</P>

<HEAD>LIEBART, BAES, DURDEYN, &amp; Co. versus THE SHIP EMPEROR.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is a suit brought on a bottomry bond, given by John Walsh to the libellants at Ostend, whereby he hypothecates the ship Emperor, of which he was then the captain, for 4500 florins, equal to £. 409:1:9 sterling money of Great Bri∣tain, advanced for repairs of the said ship. Where∣upon James Oellers, the owner of this ship, and others, his assignees, come in, and answer to the libel, alledging that this bottomry bond ought not to take effect <HI>as an hypothecation according to the maritime law.</HI></P>
<P>THE power vested in a master of a vessel to im∣pawn his owners ship or goods for necessaries fur∣nished in a foreign port, is a legal indulgence, founded on the urgency of the case, and is for the general benefit of commerce.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="024407_0969_0FC72DED6E175100"/>THERE are few rules of law more strictly de∣fined than this of hypothecation, and none in which the reason and intention of the law are more manifest: it is thus delineated.</P>
<P>"A master of a ship hath no power to take up money by bottomry, in places where his owner or owners dwell." "But when a master is out of the country, and where he hath no owners, nor any goods of theirs, nor of his own, and cannot find means to take up by exchange, or otherwise, and that for want of money the voyage might be re∣tarded or overthrown, monies may be taken up up∣on bottomry."—<HI>Molloy,</HI> book II. chap. ii. sect. 11." —"And the money so taken up by the master, is done upon great extremity, and that for the completing of the voyage, when they are in dis∣tress and want, in some foreign parts."—Sect. 12.</P>
<P>ALL the books agree in the spirit of this doc∣trine. The extreme necessity appears every where to be the <HI>reason</HI> of the law, and the <HI>intention</HI> to favour commerce. Let us now take a view of the present case. The leading facts appear from the testimony exhibited, to be these:</P>
<P>THE ship <HI>Emperor,</HI> John Walsh master, belong∣ing to James Oellers, of Philadelphia, sailed for
<PB N="165" REF="024407_0970_0FC72DEE50A99C18"/>
Ostend, with a cargo of tobacco on board: the ship and cargo being consigned by the owner to <HI>Bine, Overman</HI> and <HI>Company,</HI> merchants at <HI>Ostend.</HI> During the voyage the vessel was so much damaged by a storm at sea, that the captain was obliged to put into Dover in England, in distress. From Do∣ver, the captain sent immediate notice of his situa∣tion to the consignees at Ostend, and they speedi∣ly furnished him with a credit on London, by which he raised money sufficient to refit the ship. After this he sailed from Dover, and arrived at Ostend, where the consignees took charge of the ship and cargo.</P>
<P>BEFORE the vessel arrived at Ostend, <HI>Bine, O∣verman,</HI> and <HI>Co.</HI> had accepted bills to a considera∣ble amount, drawn upon them by <HI>Oellers,</HI> on the credit of this consignment. Upon closing all ac∣counts, Bine, Overman, and Co. found that Oel∣lers had not only drawn upon them to the full amount of the cargo and freight, ("the tobacco not selling so well as was expected") but that there remained a considerable ballance in their favour. To secure this ballance, they tell captain Walsh that he shall not leave the port, unless he will repay them the monies advanced at Dover for repairs, or hypothecate the ship. It was not in captain Walsh's power to do the one, that is, to repay
<PB N="166" REF="024407_0971_0FC72DF7EBB4D3D8"/>
the money, and he declined the other proposal for some time: but finding expences accumulating, and that he could not sail without some accommo∣dation, he at last consented to hypothecate the ship. Bine, Overman, and Co. then recommended him to <HI>Liebart, Baes, Durdeyn</HI> and <HI>Co.</HI> telling him that they would lend money on bottomry; and con∣ducted him to their house, where he executed the bottomry bond now in question. But no money was paid to Walsh; for the bills for repairs at Do∣ver had been long since discharged by the produce of the credit on London.</P>
<P>AFTER this, Bine, Overman, and Co. permitted captain Walsh to sail, and in due time he arrived at Philadelphia.</P>
<P>DURING these transactions, Oellers had failed, and assigned this ship to his creditors; and the question now is—Whether this bottomry bond shall operate to the exclusive security of the mer∣chant's at Ostend, against all other creditors, as a genuine hypothecation would do, on the principles of the maritime law?</P>
<P>AFTER a careful consideration of the circum∣stances of the case, I cannot discover one real fea∣ture of that rule of law which should be the ground
<PB N="167" REF="024407_0972_0FC72DF9FA846860"/>
of the present suit. True it is, that the ship was in necessity, and so is evey ship that wants essential repairs. But the owner had credit within reach. The consignees were not far distant. The appli∣cation was easy and certain, and the consignees no sooner heard of the disaster, but they furnished the means of relief. In fact, Bine, Overman, and Co. had the strongest inducement to exert themselves in getting the ship repaired at Dover, that she might get round to Ostend; for they had made themselves answerable for Oellers's bills upon the credit of this cargo. It was, therefore, of impor∣tance to them, that the cargo should arrive safe to their hands. So that instead of ad∣vancing money to a distressed stranger, they were only taking care of their own security. This mo∣tive is manifest by their letter to Walsh at Dover; and still further by their subsequent conduct: for after they had disposed of the cargo, and found a ballance due from Oellers to them, they insist that Walsh shall not sail, unless he will hypothecate the ship to Liebart, Baes, Durdeyn, and Co. which from all appearances seems to be the same thing as hypo∣thecating her to themselves: for the captain re∣ceived no money from Liebart, Baes, Durdeyn, and Co. who were not at all interested in the trans∣action, and whose names were only made use of to
<PB N="168" REF="024407_0973_0FC72DFE74536A90"/>
save appearances. For Bine, Overman, and Co. well knew, that being consignees, the captain had no power to hypothecate the vessel to them. And, in order to give the bottomry bond the face of a genuine hypothecation, they selected from the ge∣neral account, the monies spent for repairs at Do∣ver, and compelled the captain to hypothecate his ship, <HI>as for those particular charges,</HI> to the libel∣lants, who had not advanced one shilling towards that expence.</P>
<P>FURTHER, if we look into the accounts, we shall find, that, although this voyage was not a very successful one, yet the ship cleared all charges accrued after she sailed from Philadelphia, even including the repairs at Dover. But Oellers had drawn upon Bine, Overman, and Co. on the cre∣dit of the future voyage, long before the ship sail∣ed from Philadelphia, to raise money to fit her out; and it is these drafts brought into account which make a ballance due to the consignees. So that, instead of an hypothecation made to enable a ship to complete her voyage, it was, in fact, made to enable her owners to begin one; which was never the object of the maritime law in cases of hypothecation. Neither was this law ever design∣ed to give partial advantages in mercantile con∣nections, or secure the ballance of a running ac∣count
<PB N="169" REF="024407_0974_0FC72DFF8BA8B208"/>
between owners and consignees, to the ex∣clusion of other creditors.</P>
<P>THE importance of the present decision to the commercial character of our country, has been strongly urged in favour of the libellants. But I am not apprehensive on this account. The question in view is not to be determined by any municipal law of the country, but by a general law, univer∣sally received and understood. And I am of opi∣nion, that our national character would be much more likely to suffer by an adjudged precedent, which might open a door for dangerous collusions, by putting it in the power of captains of vessels to saddle their owners with unnecessary obligations, or to give an unfair advantage to foreign creditors, by a fraudulent use of that pre-eminent lien which the law lays on a ship and goods, properly hypo∣thecated.</P>
<P>I do not mean to insinuate that there has been any fraud or collusion in the present case. It is enough, that I do not find the claim of the libel∣lants within the spirit or intention of the maritime law: and, therefore, I adjudge,</P>
<P>THAT the bill be dismissed, and that the libel∣lants pay the costs of suit.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="024407_0975_0FC72E036B271A98"/>FROM this decision there was an appeal to the high court of errors and appeals.

<P>THE court observed, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the power of a master to hypothecate his owner's ship▪ was a necessary, but sometimes a dangerous power—the court was unwilling to extend this power farther than the law strictly authorised—a genuine hypothecation ought to be the <HI>voluntary</HI> act of the master, at the time when, and in the places where, the monies were advanced for necessaries or repairs—the mo∣ney advanced, ought to be solely on the faith of the hypothecation, and not on any personal credit —these are incontrovertible principles—the pre∣sent case not applicable to them—although the hypothecation was made to Liebart, Baes, Dur∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yn, and Co. yet it was to secure monies advanc∣ed by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine, Overman, and Co. the consignees— No authority shewn, and no authority can be shewn, because none ought to be, that an hypo∣thecation can be made to a consignee. Great mischiefs might arise if captains could hypothecate
<PB N="171" REF="024407_0976_0FC72E0B43936F90"/>
to consignees; no authority produced to prove that an hypothecation can be made in any port, but that in which a vessel first arrives after the dis∣tress and damage sustained. Bine, Overman, &amp; Co. did not repair the vessel on the faith of the hypo∣thecation; but this hypothecation was made to secure to consignees the balance of a running account.</P>
<P>THE court is unanimous in confirming the sen∣tence of the admiralty.</P>

<HEAD>TURNBULL, AND OTHERS, versus. THE SHIP ENTERPRIZE.</HEAD>
<P>THE bill in this cause is filed by certain mer∣chants against the ship Enterprize, for the recove∣ries of monies advanced by them to the captain of
<PB N="172" REF="024407_0977_0FC72E0F3B098680"/>
the said ship in the port of Philadelphia, to fit her out for an intended voyage. The ostensible or real owners, or some of them, being at the time of such advancements within the state, and known to the libellants.</P>
<P>AND it has been urged in support of the libel, that every contract of the captain for necessaries for a ship implied an hypothecation, and induces a lien on the ship in favour of the creditor, sueable in the admiralty by the rules of civil law: and the case principally relied upon as authority for this doctrine, is cited from Cowper, p. 636.</P>
<P>THE case referred to, is a suit at common law, brought by a rope-maker against the owners of a ship, for ropes furnished to the captain. The plaintiff having charged <HI>Harwood</HI> (the captain) and the owners of the ship, for the ropes, without naming, or even knowing who the owners were.</P>
<P>THE fact was, that the owners, according to the custom of the county of Essex, in England, where they probably resided, had leased the ship to Harwood for a term of years on certain condi∣tions—and the questions were, Whether under these circumstances, Harwood was not both cap∣tain and owner during the term? And whether the
<PB N="173" REF="024407_0978_0FC72E1022D92480"/>
original owners ought to be responsible for debts contracted on account of the ship, whilst in the possession of Harwood under the lease?</P>
<P>LORD MANSFIELD was of opinion, that nei∣ther the lease, nor the ignorance of the creditor as to the names or persons of the owners, could exonerate them. And to shew that the owners are bound, he says.—"Suppose the ship had been impounded in the admiralty, and <HI>that</HI> had hap∣pened at the end of the term, the owners could not have had their ship without paying the debt for which she had been impounded."</P>
<P>BUT this case is brought into view chiefly be∣cause Lord Mansfield in giving his opinion, ob∣serves, that the creditor had three securities for his debt, viz. the person of the captain with whom he contracted the <HI>specific ship,</HI> and the owners.</P>
<P>IT should be remembered, however, that this was a suit at common law; that the owners, the ship, the captain, the creditor, and the contract, were all within the realm. And there can be no doubt but that the creditor might have his action at law, either against the persons of the contrac∣tors, or might attach their property, the ship, for his debt.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="024407_0979_0FC72E118227FC98"/>BUT this case has no reference whatever to the the maritime or civil law. The doctrine of hypo∣thecation is never once mentioned, nor is the con∣tract of the captain at all placed upon that ground. The principle object was to determine whether the lease of the ship did not exonerate the lessors during the term.</P>
<P>SO in the case cited from Vezay. p. 154. This also was purely a common law process; wherein the parties, and the whole transaction, appear to have been <HI>infra corpus comitatus.</HI> "Certainly, says the lord chancellor, by the maritime law, the master hath power to hypothecate the ship <HI>during the voyage, and from the necessity of the case;</HI> but it is different where the ship is infra corpus comitatus, and the contract made by the owners or masters on land, and not arising from necessity, then the laws of the land must prevail." And this is consonant with the whole current of autho∣rities respecting a maritime hypothecation, viz. that it must be made during the voyage, and from the necessity of the case.</P>
<P>WHEN money is borrowed on the ship before the voyage is begun, the ship is not answerable in the admiralty— 1st Raym. 578. So in 2d. Raym. 982. in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase of Johnson versus Shippen, chief

iustice H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lt says—"If a ship be hypothecated be∣fore a voyage begun, <HI>that</HI> is not a matter within the jurisdiction of the admiralty; for it is a con∣tract made here, and the owners can give security to perform the contract."</P>
<P>IT appears then to be a settled doctrine, that a ship cannot be hypothecated, according to the maritime law, before the voyage is begun, or in places where the owners reside, even for those ne∣cessaries without which the ship could not proceed to sea. The law means to favour the completion, not the commencement of a voyage.</P>
<P>FOR this reason the legislature of Pennsylvania hath, <HI>by a special act,</HI> given to the artificers, who build or repair, and to those who furnish necessa∣ries to fit out a ship for sea, a lien on the vessel sueable in the admiralty before the voyage is be∣gun, because the maritime law does not extend to their security.</P>
<P>SINCE then, it appears that the advance of mo∣nies to fit out the ship Enterprize, was made be∣fore the commencement of her voyage, and not from necessity, and that the captain, the owners, or some of them, and the contractors were all within the state at the time of the transaction; and
<PB N="176" REF="024407_0981_0FC72E1D9A8CB508"/>
as the suit is not brought under the act of assem∣bly of the 27th of March, 1784, I cannot admit this case to be of admiralty jurisdiction, and there∣fore I adjudge</P>

<HEAD><HI>EDWARD FORBES</HI> versus <HI>THE BRIG HANNAH:</HI> ANDREW HODGE, RESPONDENT.</HEAD>
<P>EDWARD FORBES of Dublin, in Ireland, has libelled against the brig Hannah, for the a∣mount of certain bonds of bottomry, which Fran∣cis Lewis, then captain and principal owner of the vessel, gave as security for monies advanced by Forbes, in the port of Dublin, for necessaries, as it is said, for the said brig, and to enable her to complete her voyage.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="024407_0982_0FC72E1F01D427A8"/>THE circumstances of this case appear from the testimony to be these:</P>
<P>FRANCIS LEWIS, principal owner of the brig Hannah, had chartered her to one <HI>Varlo,</HI> for a voy∣age from some port in America to Dublin in Ire∣land. Varlo himself went passenger with his goods, and Lewis was captain for the voyage. Af∣ter their arrival at Dublin, Lewis borrowed mo∣ney of Forbes, at three several times, for which he gave three bonds of bottomry on his brig, a∣mounting, with premium and charges, to £.214:0:8 sterling money of Great Britain. Forbes then put a cargo on board the brig, in which it seems that Lewis was concerned, as he was to have one-half of the nett profits of the adventure, exclusive of freight, and to be answerable for one-half of the loss, if any there should be, on the sales. Lewis left Dublin with his cargo, bound for Boston in America. It does not appear whether ever he arrived at Boston, or what he did with his cargo; but in April last he brought the brig into the port of Philadelphia, at which time some of his mari∣ners sued in this court for wages due, and the brig was attached and condemned for those wages, a mounting to £.29, Lewis making no plea of de∣fence against the libel. In consequence of this libel and sentence, a writ issued to the marshal,
<PB N="178" REF="024407_0983_0FC72E209786FEB8"/>
in the usual form, directing him to sell the brig Hannah, with her tackle, apparel, and furniture, <HI>or such parts thereof,</HI> as might be necessary, to sa∣tisfy the decree in favour of the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ners, toge∣ther with the charges and costs of suit. But Lew∣is requested the marshal to sell <HI>the whole</HI> of the vessel, with her tackle, &amp;c. under the decree, and even endorsed this request on the writ of sale. And to shew that he was the sole owner of the brig at that time, he exhibited to, and lodged with the marshal, an assignment or bill of sale from one Simpson, who had been a part owner, of all his interest in the brig, to Lewis.</P>
<P><HI>ANDREW HODGE,</HI> respondent in this cause, pur∣chased the vessel at the marshal's sale, and paid down the full consideration money, out of which the marshal deducted the mariners wages, with charges and costs of suit, and paid the balance to Lewis as sole owner. After this, Lewis went off without saying any thing of the bottomry bonds he had given to Forbes in Dublin. And now these bonds have come over, and Forbes has attached the brig in the hands of Hodge the purchaser.</P>
<P>ON these circumstances, two questions have a∣risen, viz.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="024407_0984_0FC72E2E533F8550"/><HI>First,</HI> WHETHER these bottomry bonds have hypothecated the vessel, according to the rules of maritime law, so as to bring the cause within ad∣miralty jurisdiction?</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> SUPPOSING it to be so, whether the sale and purchase, under the authority of this court, have not vested the property in the respondent, exonerated of all prior engagements?</P>
<P>TO determine the first point, it will be necessary to consider the characteristic marks which distin∣guish an hypothecation, according to the maritime law, from a common bottomry bond or mortgage, according to the custom of merchants, cognizable by the common law.</P>
<P>BY the maritime law
<Q>a master of a ship hath no power to take up money by bottomry in pla∣ces where his owners dwell; but when he is out of the country, and where he hath no ow∣ners, or any goods of theirs, or his own, and cannot find means to take up, by exchange or otherwise, and that for want of money, the voy∣age might be retarded or overthrown, monies may be taken up on bottomry.</Q>
<HI>Molloy.</HI> B. II. Ch. xi. Sec. 11.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="024407_0985_0FC72E304BA2F930"/>FROM this it appears, that the true grounds of a maritime hypothecation are the <HI>necessity</HI> of the case, and the <HI>want of personal credit.</HI> Wherever this doctrine occurs in the books, these two cir∣cumstances are strongly pointed at. Thus, in 3d. <HI>Mod.</HI> 244, "The reason of the civil law, which allows the pawning of a ship for necessaries up∣on the high seas, seems to be plain, because there may be an extraordinary and invincible necessity to which the admiralty jurisdiction is limited: for if the law should be otherwise, the master might take as much money as he will." And so the court, in that case, ordered a trial on the ne∣cessity.</P>
<P>SO also, in <HI>Bridgeman's</HI> case—Hob. 12. a prohi∣bition was granted, because the impawning was not shewn to be <HI>occasioned by necessity.</HI></P>
<P>IN 1st. <HI>Magens,</HI> there is a report of an admiral∣ty suit on a bottomry bond, at the conclusion of which, p. 329. the author says, "Persons living in sea ports may learn from this case, not to be∣lieve or trust too easily a captain they do not know; and when they propose benefiting them∣selves by lending money on bottomry to such whose distresses oblige them to seek it, the lenders, for their own satisfaction and security, ought to
<PB N="181" REF="024407_0986_0FC72E31D9F56E78"/>
have proofs given <HI>that there was a necessity</HI> for such an advance, and that the money had actually been employed for the purposes alledged."</P>
<P>FURTHER, the impawning must be in foreign parts; that is, where neither the owner, nor ma∣ster hath any personal credit: for this constitutes an essential part of the necessity—"The master can have no credit abroad but by hypothecation." Salk. 35.—"Where a ship in distress is forced in∣to any port where her owners have no correspon∣dents to supply the master with the money neces∣sary to enable him to prosecute his voyage, he may take it on bottomry from those will advance it on the easiest terms." 1st. <HI>Mag.</HI> 27.</P>
<P>THE reason is, the maritime law requires, that the monies should be lent solely on the credit of the ship, and that the security of the lender should depend altogether on her safety: and there∣fore, if she be well engaged, that is according to the principles stated, she shall be for ever obliged till redemption—Molloy book II. ch. ii. sec. 15. And therefore also, because of the hazard, an unusual interest is allowed on the monies advan∣ced.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="024407_0987_0FC72E35856D1960"/>SUCH are the principles which designate a ma∣ritime hypothecation within admiralty jurisdiction.</P>
<P>BUT bottomry bonds may be given by owners for security of mercantile or other debts; and these may be executed either in places where the owners dwell, or in foreign parts, by their order. They may be formed under a variety of circumstances, and depend on many contingencies, according to the conditions or terms of the deed or contract.</P>
<P>IT should seem by the <HI>necessity,</HI> so frequently urged as the ground of a maritime hypothecation, that the ship should be driven by distress into some other port than that of her destination; or, at least, that some extraordinary casualty should oc∣casion an unforeseen and inevitable expence in the port of her voyage. Because it is hardly to be supposed, that an owner would send his ship, much less that he would take her himself, to a place where he could not command either money or credit for ordinary repairs and supplies.</P>
<P>IN the present case it does not appear, nor has it been suggested, that any extraordinary circum∣stances occasioned an unforeseen necessity. The cap∣tain (Lewis), who was also principal owner, ar∣rives
<PB N="183" REF="024407_0988_0FC72E3F853C06E0"/>
after a prosperous voyage at the port of de∣stination with his freighter on board. Here the voyage is completed, and it may be presumed that he there received his freight. If so, he could not be without money sufficient to refit his vessel for a new voyage. And that he was not without personal credit is manifest, because Forbes entrust∣ed him with a new cargo, and agreed to allow him 35<HI>s</HI>0 Irish money per ton for freight on all the goods he should deliver: and also one half of the nett profits arising from the sale of the cargo, he to run one half of the risk of loss. This mer∣cantile connection shews at least that Lewis was in some credit with Forbes.</P>
<P>BESIDES, if we look into the accounts, we shall find the first article charged is £. 32:5:6 ster∣ling paid to Varlo, by Lewis's order, to take up and cancel a former bottomry bond. It seems strange that Lewis, after navigating Varlo and his goods across the sea, should fall in his debt. This circumstance is not at all accounted for. But be it as it may, Forbes should certainly have forwar∣ded his former bottomry bond, with an account of the occasion and expenditures for which it was given, that a judgment might have been formed whether it was a proper hypothecation or not:
<PB N="184" REF="024407_0989_0FC72E40C3C73578"/>
or have shewn that the brig was under condemna∣tion of the admiralty at Dublin on account of that bond; and that the £. 32:5:6 was paid for her redemption.</P>
<P>UPON a view of the circumstances of the pre∣sent case, I do not find them such as the maritime law requires to constitute a genuine hypothecation within admiralty jurisdiction. This point being conclusive, it is unnecessary to determine on the second general question.</P>
<P>I adjuge that the bill in this cause be dissmissed; and that the libellants pay the costs of suit.</P>

<HEAD>MANUEL SAGAS DE CANIZARES versus THE SANTISSIMA TRINIDAD. JUAN JOSEPH DE AGUIRE PEREZ, <HI>Respondent.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE libel in this cause states two separate claims of Canizares, the complainant, against the brigantine Santissima Trinidad: the one founded on an hypothecation of the said vessel, made by the then captain to Santiago Cupisono at Havan∣nah, for two hundred dollars advanced by the said Cupisono for necessaries for the said brigan∣tine, as it is said, and to enable her to prosecute her voyage; which instrument of hypothecation is endorsed or assigned over by the lender to the present libellant: and the other, founded on a writ∣ten contract between Narisco Sanchez y Serna, then captain of the vessel, and Canizares the libel∣lant, respecting the wages he should receive for serving as pilot and mariner on board the said bri∣gantine in her voyage from Havannah to Philadel∣phia. As these claims arise from different con∣tracts,
<PB N="186" REF="024407_0991_0FC72E49B024DFF8"/>
it is manifest that they must be separately considered.</P>
<P>TO determine on the force of this instrument of bottomry, I shall first state the circumstances necessary to a genuine hypothecation, accord∣ing to the maritime law; and then take a view of the history of this vessel's voyage, and her situation at Havannah when Cupisono advanced the money in question.</P>
<P>AS to the first, I have had occasion in three for∣mer suits in this court, to state the law of a mari∣time hypothecation, and have not since found rea∣son to alter my opinion of the principles on which those causes were decided. The causes to which I refer were Liebart, Baes, Durdeyn and Co. against the ship Emperor, Turnbull against the ship En∣terprise, and Forbes against the brig Hannah. I can only now repeat the substance of what was then observed.</P>
<P>[<HI>Here the judge recapitulated the doctrines ad∣vanced, and the authorities cited, in the cases referred to.</HI>]</P>
<P>I shall now state the history of the voyage of this brigantine, as the same may be deduced from the testimony.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="024407_0992_0FC72E4B4D7B5EC8"/>IT appears that this vessel had been chartered on account of the king of Spain, and was to sail from Philadelphia to Carthagena with a cargo of flour which was to be sold there, and a cargo of dyewood purchased and brought back to Philadel∣phia, or some port of the United States. Such was the designated voyage; but it seems the cap∣tain, instead of returning to Philadelphia from Carthagena, went to Jamaica with an adventure of his own; to what amount does not appear: that at Jamaica he purchased dry goods fit for the Ha∣vannah market, and then took the brig to Ha∣vannah, where he disposed of the goods he had bought at Jamaica upon his own account: that at Havannah he borrowed two hundred dollars of Cupisono, and executed the instrument called the hypothecation, to engage the vessel and her freight for this sum: that part of this money was ex∣pended in paying wages to the mariners, and part in supplying them with fresh provisions: that the vessel was refitted at the king's arsenal, and at the expence of the intendant: and that she sailed for, and arrived at the port of Philadelphia.</P>
<P>I agree with the council for the libellant, that the validity of an hypothecation ought not to de∣pend on the regularity of the captain's conduct with respect to his owners, previous to the time
<PB N="188" REF="024407_0993_0FC72E4CC5CF8C80"/>
of his arrival in a foreign port, and borrowing money for the relief of the ship's necessities; and will go further, and say, that neither▪ ought it to be affected by the captain's subsequent conduct; provided the lender was in no wise privy to, or knowingly assistant in his obliquities.</P>
<P>IT has been urged on the other side, that the law of hppothecation was designed solely for the benefit of the owners, and an inference drawn, that if it can be shewn, that the owners of a vessel have not been benefited, but injured by the cap∣tains conduct, and consequent hypothecation, it ought not to be allowed. But this law has for its object the good of commerce in general. And no stranger would lend money on hypothecation if his lien on the ship was to be invalidated by some future proof that the voyage was irregular, or that the captain had deviated from the orders of his owners, and injured their interest, either before or after the hypothecation made.</P>
<P>BUT where shall we find, in the present case, that <HI>necessity</HI> which should justify the captains conduct, and be the ground of a genuine hypothecation? This vessel was chartered for the use of the king of Spain by his agent: the cargo on board was on the king's account, and she arrives in a lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>
<PB N="189" REF="024407_0994_0FC72E4E42E71290"/>
and disabled condition in one of his Majesty's ports, where he had an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fficer stationed. This officer, the intendant, orders the vessel to the public warehouse to be discharged, and then round to the king's arsenal to be repaired; all which was done at the king's expence. In truth, I cannot conceive a case of less necessity, or one wherein a more certain and able relief could be de∣pended upon.</P>
<P>BUT it is said, that there were considerable de∣lays before the intendant interfered; and that the captain was obliged to send in five or six memori∣als, and in the mean time the mariners were in great want of wages and fresh provisions; and that in this necessity the captain applied to Cupi∣sono for two hundred dollars, who refused to lend them unless the vessel should be hypothecated for his security.</P>
<P>IT is in testimony, however, that this money was lent by Cupisono before the captain had made any application to the intendant, and therefore, the neglect of the intendant could not have occasioned the necessity of borrowing from Cupisono: that the captain of a vessel in the king's service, and in one of his majesty's ports, should not find credit for a few days provisions until the proper officer
<PB N="190" REF="024407_0995_0FC72E57ACBF6220"/>
could be applied to, is too incredible to be se∣riously admitted: still less can it be a legal ground for an hypothecation, that the mariners must have wages paid to them in a place where it does not appear that any wages were due; nor is it pro∣bable that any could be due, because this was neither the conclusion of the voyage, nor even a port of delivery.</P>
<P>THE money ought to have been lent solely on the faith of the hypothecation and not on any per∣sonal credit: but here was a strong and well founded credit; for it is in the proof that Cupi∣sono knew that this vessel was chartered for the king's service; and it is expressly said, that the mo∣ney was borrowed to pay wages and procure fresh provisions—"<HI>until money could be had from the intendant.</HI>"</P>
<P>FURTHER, in the quotation from Molloy B. II. ch. xi. sec. 11. it is said—"When a master is out of the country, and where he hath no owners, nor any goods of theirs, <HI>nor of his own.</HI>"—Now it is confest that the captain had goods of his own, and, as it should seem, to a considerable amount, since it was sufficient to induce him to violate his duty to his employers, in taking the vessel, contra∣ry to their orders, on a trading voyage to Jamaica
<PB N="191" REF="024407_0996_0FC72E59905388F0"/>
for his own benefit; that at Jamaica he bought goods suitable for the Havannah market, and ac∣tually sold them at the Havannah though contra∣band; and that Cupisono, the lender, was privy to these circumstances. So that instead of the lender's having the vessel alone to look to for his security, he had two substantial personal credits to depend upon, viz. the intendant, from whom he might reasonably expect repayment of monies advanced for the use of a vessel in the king's employ; and the captain, whose property he might have attach∣ed before he left the island, if satisfaction was not made. This circumstance alone, that is to say, Cupisono's knowledge that the captain had proper∣ty of his own on the spot, sufficient to answer the present exigencies of the vessel, would have invali∣dated the bond as a maritime hypothecation, inas∣much as it removes that <HI>necessity</HI> which the law requires.</P>
<P>THERE is a circumstance in the present case, which although not in itself conclusive, forms too striking a feature in the transaction to pass unno∣ticed. A singularity in a maritime hypothecation is, that the law allows an extraordinary premium or interest to the lender, to any extent, according to the risk to be run▪ because, if the ship should be lost, the money lent is lost with her. But
<PB N="192" REF="024407_0997_0FC72E5B209DEE08"/>
here, a stranger lends two hundred dollars to a captain in distress without even stipulating for common legal interest for the use of his money: I say, this alone might not be conclusive against the hypothecation, because a man may be as ge∣nerous as he pleases; but in connection with the other circumstances, it gives room for suspicion, that the engagement of this vessel to Cupisono was not made within the rules or spirit of the ma∣ritime law.</P>
<P>FOR the above reasons, I adjudge that the bill in this cause be dismissed, so far as the same hath respect to a claim of two hundred dollars, said to have been lent on the credit of the brigantine Santissima Trinidad.</P>
<P>I am now to consider the libellant's demand of wages for serving as pilot and mariner on board this vessel from Havannah to Philadelphia.</P>
<P>THIS claim for wages, amounting to £.87:5:0, is founded on a written contract made at the Havannah between Narisco Sanchez y Serna,
<PB N="193" REF="024407_0998_0FC72E61F9EC8978"/>

<P>BUT it has been contended, that as this agree∣ment is in writing, and bears a seal, and is not, ac∣cording to the terms thereof, in the usual way of a∣greeing for mariners wages, it becomes a special contract, and is not properly of admiralty juris∣diction.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="024407_0999_0FC72A200BDF2388"/>ITS being in writing, however, is no more than a testimony or memorandum of the agreement made, and does not affect the jurisdiction of this court. What is called a seal appears to be nothing more than a printed stamp, for which a duty is paid to the crown: certainly it is not the seal of the parties, or of either of them. But, as to the terms of the contract, these are indeed out of the usual course, and deserve consideration.</P>
<P>ONE of the reasons for allowing mariners to sue in the admiralty is, that the debt arises from services performed, or to be peformed at sea, and a lien on the ship given to them for their secu∣rity, because the contract they make is supposed to be on the credit of the ship.</P>
<P>NOW, although the wages of twenty dollars per month, promised in the present case, appear to be extravagant, yet, as the difficulty of getting a per∣son qualified to serve both as a skilful pilot and able mariner might have been great, I think the rate of wages per month ought to be allowed as con∣tracted for. But I cannot, upon any principle, allow that a captain hath a power to bind his ow∣ners and their vessel to the payment of a mariner's wages for three months after his discharge, and af∣ter all services at sea and elsewhere have ceased.
<PB N="195" REF="024407_1000_0FC72A2446F0A450"/>
If he could legally do this for three months, why not for six or twelve; or even saddle his ow∣ners with an annuity for life to a mariner for a few weeks actual service? How far the common law might consider this contract as binding on the captain personally, it is not my business to say; but as judge of admiralty, I shall be far from doing my part towards establishing a precedent by which captains, in addition to the great pow∣er they necessarily have over the property of their employers, may have that of obliging them to the payment of unlimited sums for an unlimited time. The captain might have engaged for his owners to pay wages per month during the ser∣vice, or a specific sum for the run to any amount justifiable by the circumstances and necessities of the case; but to bind the owner to periodical payments to a mariner after a total discharge from the service, is what I believe no captain of a ves∣sel ever before attempted. For whether this was to be paid all at once, or at three several times, it matters not; the contract is for <HI>three months wa∣ges after discharge.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is another claim under this contract for sixty dollars to take the libellant back to Ha∣vannah on being discharged here.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="024407_1001_0FC72A254A51CCC8"/>THE maritime custom is, that if a master or owner discharges a mariner in a foreign port, be∣fore the completion of the voyage for which he engaged, some reasonable allowance shall be made, over and above the wages due, to enable him to return to his own country, or go to the port, which by the articles, should have completed the voyage; and this allowance is usually the amount of one month's wages: and it is a reasonable custom, where the mariner is willing to perform articles and finish the voyage, but the master or owner thinks fit to discharge him sooner for their own convenience, and without just cause of complaint against the mariner. Therefore this part of the contract before us is consistent with maritime custom, but certainly unreasonable as to the sum promised.</P>
<P>WHATEVER power a captain may have by law to bind his owners by contracts made abroad for the services of the ship, yet he cannot oblige them beyond what is usual and customary, without shewing that the unusual charge, arose from the ne∣cessity of the case. The present charge is express∣ly made for conveying the libellant back to the Havannah: I have therefore enquired what is the usual charge for a passage from the port to the
<PB N="197" REF="024407_1002_0FC72A26D2F6B898"/>
Havannah, and find that forty dollars is an ample and generous allowance.</P>
<P>FRAUD and collusion between the captain and Canizares the libellant, have been suggested, but not proved: yet if I had not found that this cause might and ought to be determined on general principles, there are two circumstances in the case which would have induced a more strict enquiry into the captain's conduct. The one, which I have already noticed, is Cupisono's lending money on hypothecation without security, or even asking for common interest, which, though a possible, is not a usual occurrence. The other is a contract between the captain and Canizares, which concludes with these remarkable words—"Each (that is the original and copy) <HI>having the same strength as if they had been executed before a notary public at Havannah.</HI>" The question naturally oc∣curs, and why was not this contract executed before a notary public at Havannah? An honest captain, who is reduced to the necessity of binding his owners to hard and usual terms, would at least take care that nothing should be wanting in point of form and public notoriety to justify his conduct. And, besides, I suspect that this contract, which bears? printed seal or stamp, could not be legally execu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> according to the regulations of the ma∣ritime
<PB N="198" REF="024407_1003_0FC72A2906E405D8"/>
laws and customs, but in the presence of a notary or some public officer. But it was not necessary to clear up these appearances, as the cause may be decided on other grounds.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, I adjudge and decree, that Canizares, the libellant, have and receive from Juan Joseph de Aguire Perez, the respondent, the sum of 112 dollars and 60-90ths of a dollar, equal to £. 42:5, Pennsylvania currency: that is to say:

<HEAD>PAUL ANDERSON, &amp; AL. versu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> JAMES FORBES, LATE MASTER OF THE DOLPHIN.</HEAD>
<P>THE case was—The libellants engaged in the year 1782, with James Forbes, then captain of the ship Dolphin, for a mercantile voyage from Phi∣ladelphia to the Havannah, and back again; for which they were to receive, not monthly wages, but a stipulated sum, to be paid them at the Ha∣vannah. Whilst the ship was at Havannah, the Spanish governor of Cuba had projected a military expedition against the island of New Providence, and offered considerable emoluments to such Ame∣ricans in port as would enter their vessels in the Spanish service, for this expedition: viz. 10 dol∣lars per ton for their vessels, and a gratuity of 700 dollars to each captain. Forbes, after paying his crew the stipulated sum for the original voy∣age, proposed to them this new expedition: an expedition not known, or thought of, at the time of the first contract, and of a nature entirely differ∣ent
<PB N="201" REF="024407_1006_0FC72A2D8BFCE8A0"/>
from the service for which they stood engaged to the ship. The mariners declined this proposal, unless informed what recompence they were to have for their time and hazard in this new service. Whereupon Forbes assured them of at least 20 dollars per month to each man, and hinted further emoluments from the Spanish government. Thus assured, the mariners entered on the service, and afterwards sailed with the Spanish fleet, and were present at, and assistant in, the siege of New Pro∣vidence.</P>
<P>THE only question seems to be, whether a con∣tract expressly made shall be fulfilled or not?</P>
<P>WHEN the Spanish governor agreed to give 10 dollars per ton for American vessels, and a gratuity of 700 dollars to each captain, he certainly expect∣ed that such vessels should be properly manned, and fitted for the service. Captain Forbes know∣ing this, and knowing also that the proposed ser∣vice could not, by any construction, be considered as a part of the original voyage for which the ma∣riners had contracted, enters upon a new treaty with them. Suppose these mariners had rejected the proposed expedition, the captain could not have compelled them to go, but must have engag∣ed other seamen for the purpose. And there
<PB N="202" REF="024407_1007_0FC72A3092727538"/>
could have been no doubt but that the crew should be paid according to contract. The present li∣bellants are precisely in the situation the new crew would have been in, and are equally entitled.</P>
<P>AS it is in testimony, that the libellants were at least two months in the Spanish service, I adjudge, that they have and receive from the respondent, <HI>fifteen pounds</HI> each; and that the respondent pay the costs of suit, except such part of the said costs as may have accrued by the taking certain depo∣sitions, which were not admitted as evidence, which costs the libellants are to pay.</P>

<HEAD>CHARLES MORAN versus ALEXANDER BAUDOIN.</HEAD>
<P>THE libel in this cause states—That Charles Moran, the libellant, entered on board the ship
<PB N="203" REF="024407_1008_0FC72A3227D03ED8"/>
l'Heureux, at Nantz, in France, on the 23d day of October, 1786, under an engagement for a voyage from the said port of Nantz to New Orleans, in the Missisippi; from thence to go to Martinique, and from thence to return to France: that Alexan∣der Baudoin, the captain, had totally altered this voyage by repeated deviations, whereby the con∣tract was broken, and thereupon the libellant prays a discharge, and the amount of wages due.</P>
<P>THE circumstances of this case, appear by the testimony, to be these:</P>
<P>THAT this vessel sailed from Nantz, October 3d, 1786: that the marines understood, and were in∣formed, that this voyage was to be from Nantz to New Orleans; thence to the West Indies, and thence back to Nantz, or to some port in France; and that it would continue from 10 to 15 or 16 months: that under this expectation, the mariners were registered at the proper office at Nantz, ac∣cording to the manner of registering seamen in France: that instead of pursuing this voyage, as designated to them, they were taken three times to New Orleans, twice to Martinique, once to Aux Cayes, once to Havannah, and were now brought to the port of Philadelphia: that in the course of these several voyages, the libellant and others of
<PB N="204" REF="024407_1009_0FC72A338742B420"/>
the crew, made frequent complaints of the prolon∣gation of, and deviations from, the originally in∣tended voyage, and had applied to the intendants of some of the ports they were at, demanding to be discharged, or taken back to France: but were detained in the service of the ship, by repeated assurances of the captain, that from the then next intended port they should sail for France: that in particular, when they were at Martinique the se∣cond time, the whole crew complained and demand∣ed their discharge; whereupon the captain threw the boatswain and another sailor into prison: and that the boatswain wrote to the commanding offi∣cer of a frigate there, who sent for him out of prison, and obliged the captain to pay him the wa∣ges due, and discharge him.</P>
<P>TO this libel and testimony, the respondent hath urged in reply:</P>
<P>THAT no contract or articles between the cap∣tain and the crew of this ship have been exhibited: that the libel itself is deficient in form; and that let the deviations from the original voyage be what they may, the libellant hath for his part justified the whole, by signing a verbal process on board the ship, on the 30th of April last, certifying that the ship l'Heureux had suffered damage by storm,
<PB N="205" REF="024407_1010_0FC72A3759034260"/>
and agreeing to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the port of Philadelphia in distress, which verbal process so signed, has been exhibited in this court.</P>
<P>AS there is no ordinance of the United States, or act of the legislature of Pennsylvania touching the present object, the claim of the libellant, who is a French subject, and was shipped in France, will be best determined by the marine ordinances of the country to which he belongs, and under which he engaged in the service of this vessel. These ordinances strictly prohibit any captain or master of a vessel from receiving on board his ship any mariner, as such, who is not entered in his rolle d'equipage made up in the commissary's office, or bureau de classes of the port where the vessel shall be. See, Ord. de Mar. vol i. p. 422. and p. 715. Now as it has not been denied but that the libellant has served on board this ship ever since she sailed from Nantz, it is in vain to call upon him for proof of the contract made at Nantz, since the rolle d'equipage, or a copy of it, is always in the captain's hands, and never in the mariner's. Had no such contract taken place as mentioned in the libel, or should the libellant demand larger wages than had been agreed upon, the captain would have shewn the rolle d'equi∣page against him. As he has not done this, al∣though
<PB N="206" REF="024407_1011_0FC72A38C5B5F9A0"/>
in his power, it follows that the allegation of the libellant must be admitted as true. Indeed it is in positive testimony, that the libellant entered on board at Nantz, and was to receive fifty livers per month wages, which is sufficient proof of a contract.</P>
<P>THE next point is to consider the repeated de∣viations from the original voyage, and how far this should operate in releasing the mariner from his contract. To lay it down as a general rule, that the least deviation from a designated voyage should invalidate the articles and discharge the ma∣riners from the ship's service, would perhaps be construing those articles too strictly, and would cer∣tainly be very injurious to commerce. Shipping articles ought not to be judged by the same rules with a policy of insurance, or a common law con∣tract, their object and ground of reason being quite different. Yet gross and unnecessary devia∣tions shall free a mariner from his engagement. But there is no present occasion to fix a general rule. This cause must be determined by positive law: and there is an ordinance of France express to the purpose Mar. Ord. vol. I. p. 548. art. 4.— "If at any time after the arrival and discharge of the vessel at the port of her destination, the cap∣tain or master, instead of returning, shall freight
<PB N="207" REF="024407_1012_0FC72A3C8D0344B0"/>
or load his ship to go elsewhere, the mariner may leave her if he chooses, unless it has been otherwise determined by his special agreement." And this rule is further inforced by Valin's com∣mentary on the article.</P>
<P>THERE appears to me a strong presumption that the the boatswain, who was paid and dischar∣ged at Martinique by order of the commander of a frigate there, claimed the benefit of this ordi∣nance. It is said, indeeed, that his mother was dead, and that he had business in France; but this I think would hardly be admitted as a suffici∣ent reason to discharge a mariner in the midst of a voyage. It is plain that Baudoin did not deem it sufficient, for he put the man in prison for deman∣ding his wages and discharge.</P>
<P>THE objections to the libel in point of form are not sufficient to invalidate the suit. It is not indeed so specific as might be wished, but the substance of the complaint is alledged, viz. an engage∣ment for a certain voyage, a total deviation from that voyage, and a citation prayed for, to shew cause why the wages accrued should not be paid, and the libellant discharged.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="024407_1013_0FC72A3E0981BF10"/>THE verbal process signed by the libellant on board the ship, is the next circumstance relied upon by the respondent. But this cannot have the operation expected. If the ship was really in distress, there is no doubt but that any mariner would sign his consent to put into a strange port to avoid impending danger, and refit th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> damaged rigging. But this deviation occasioned by neces∣sity cannot serve as a justification of former devia∣tions where no such necessity occured.</P>
<P>I am clearly of opinion, that if this cause was tri∣ed before a French court of justice, the libellant could not be refused the benefit of the mariners ordinance expressly in favour of his claim.</P>
<P>I adjudge that the libellant shall have his wages, at the rate of fifty livers per month, from October 23d 1786; and that the respondent pay the costs of this suit.</P>

<HEAD>JOHN THYBOUT versus ALEXANDER BAUDOIN.</HEAD>
<P>THYBOUT was a mariner belonging to the same ship and under the same circumstances with Charles Moran, libellant in the foregoing cause, but did not join in the libel with Moran; because, as it was said, the captain kept him on board con∣fined till the determination of that suit should be known. But he now filed his complaint, claiming his wages and discharge.</P>
<P>COUNCIL for the respondent, in addition to their arguments in the former cause, alledged that the last voyage from New Orleans, was authorised by government to procure supplies for that city, which had just then suffered by a terrible fire; and se∣condly, that the libellant had made a new contract at New Orleans, and was entered accordingly on the rolle d'equipage there. In proof of these alle∣gations,
<PB N="210" REF="024407_1015_0FC72A4A2FA8CE40"/>
copies and translations of the ship's pa∣pers were offered in testimony. But the libel∣lant's council objected to the admission of these papers. Whereupon an argument was had on this previous question. After consideration, the judge gave his opinion as follows.</P>
<P>THE question now before me is—Whether cer∣tain papers, presented to the court as copies and translations of the manifest, rolle d'equipage, &amp;c. of the ship L'Heureux, respecting her last voyage from New Orleans, shall be admitted as testimony in the cause now in agitation, or not? And it is de∣clared, that the design in procuring these papers is to prove, first, an authorised and necessary devi∣ation from the original voyage contracted for at Nantz; and, 2dly, a new engagement made by the libellant at New Orleans.</P>
<P>THE correctness of these copies, and the au∣thenticity of the originals, are supposed to be esta∣blished by the deposition of Mr. John Leamy; and the fidelity of the translations are certified by the notarial seals of sworn interpreters.</P>
<P>THE fidelity of the translations is, I think, suf∣ficiently ascertained, because the translator is offi∣cially known to the court, being commissioned by,
<PB N="211" REF="024407_1016_0FC72A4E17F4BC78"/>
and answerable to government for the due execu∣tion of his trust. But it is not so certain what evi∣dence shall be sufficient to authenticate the instru∣ments of officers of a foreign country, so as to give them the force of legal testimony in our courts. The authorities that have been cited all refer to cases, where the originals, the copies, and the certifying officers, were all within the realm of England, and therefore do not come up to the point in question.</P>
<P>MR. Leamy's deposition as to the authenticity of these papers is founded on his belief only, and not on positive testimony, as appears on his cross examination in these words:
<Q>The said deponent being cross-examined, saith, that he does not personally know any of the persons who have signed any of the original papers before men∣tioned, nor did he ever see any of them write: and that he, the deponent, had no papers in his custody with the hands and seals of the above mentioned persons to them, to compare the said papers with, except the signature of the present governor, with which he did not compare them.</Q></P>
<P>BUT, secondly, it is manifest, that these papers were copied and translated in this city, pending
<PB N="212" REF="024407_1017_0FC72A5A36182500"/>
this suit, and within the cognizance of the court. Why then were not the originals exhibited, that the translations might be made by the direction, and under the authority of the court, after having had the opportunity of inspecting these originals, and judging of their authenticity? It has been at∣tempted to shew that this could not be done<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The captain sailed from the port during the suit, and took the original papers with him.</NOTE>. But as the court of admiralty is always open, and as these papers were in the city for at least some days, there was time sufficient to have them compared, copied, and translated by authority. The court hath a right to the best testimony that can be pro∣cured with any reasonable convenience; and as the originals of these papers were in the hands of the respondent's council, and they have not thought fit to file them as exhibits in the cause, I shall not now admit the copies taken by their di∣rection. I think such a precedent might have dan∣gerous future consequences.</P>
<P>THE argument then proceeded on the merits, and nearly the same grounds were travelled over, which had been taken in Moran's case.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="024407_1018_0FC72A61100AC408"/>AFTER advisement, judgment was given as follows:</P>
<P>JOHN Thybout, the present libellant, having shipped at the same time, and under the same contract, with Charles Moran, whose suit was lately decided in this court, the testimony exhibit∣ed in Moran's case has been applied to this.</P>
<P>THERE are only three new exhibits in the pre∣sent cause: viz. a protest made by captain Baudoin and his officers, soon after his arrival at Phila∣delphia, dated the 17th of May last, and two de∣positions; one of William Matthié, a passenger on board the l'Heureux, and the other, a second de∣position of Bastian Gaudin, who had given testimo∣mony in the former cause. The purport of the protest is to shew, that this ship was driven by a N. N. E. storm into the port of Philadelphia, in distress, and the tenor of the two depositions tends directly to contradict the assertion of the protest.</P>
<P>FROM all that appears in testimony, this vessel was bound from New Orleans to the port of Nantz in France: and Matthié, the passenger, received a passport from the governor's secre∣tary at New Orleans, to be admitted on board
<PB N="214" REF="024407_1019_0FC72A620D6A3C10"/>
as a passenger to Nantz. How then it could possi∣bly happen, that this, or any other vessel, being in the latitude of 25° 3′ north, should be driven by a violent N. N. E. wind, to the latitude of 35° 4′ north, where the verbal process was made on board, is to me quite incomprehensible. But as I do not think the libellant's claim does at all depend upon the validity of either the verbal pro∣cess, or the subsequent protest, I shall observe no further upon them.</P>
<P>IT is manifest to me, that the libellant hath been detained in the service of this ship an unreasonable length of time beyond the period of the voyage contracted for: that the original agreement made at Nantz, between the captain and his crew, has been violated and dissolved by frequent unnecessary deviations: that the promises of the captain, at every deviation, to return immediately to France, have been repeatedly broken: and that, if this cause was tried before a French court, under the marine ordinances of that country, there is no doubt but that the libellant would recover his wa∣ges, and obtain his discharge.</P>
<P>I see no reason for distinguishing this from Charles Mora<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> case: and therefore, I adjudge, that the libellant shall have his wages, at the rate
<PB N="215" REF="024407_1020_0FC72A64EF337730"/>
of 30 livres per month, from the 23d of October, 1786, to the 30th of June last; deducting 180 li∣vres, which he acknowledges to have received: and that the respondent pay the costs of suit.</P>

<L>At once with hunger and with thirst opprest,</L>
<L>The fainting soul pin'd in the panting breast.</L>
<L>In deep distress they call'd on God most high,</L>
<L>Who with his wonted mercy heard their cry:</L>
<L>The heav'ns did mana for their food distill,</L>
<L>And from the rock burst forth the limpid rill:</L>
<L>From desert wilds, where destitute they roam,</L>

<L>GODDESS sublime! on whose advent'rous wing,</L>
<L>Like the sweet lark, fleet fancy mounts to sing;</L>
<L>Whether it chance to please thee, youthful queen,</L>
<L>With airy step to grace the rural scene;</L>
<L>Or softly languish thro' the breezy grove,</L>
<L>In all the dying tenderness of love:</L>
<L>Whether thro' some untrodden flow'ry way,</L>
<L>With contemplation mild, thou lov'st to stray;</L>
<L>Or on a tempest's rapid fury rise,</L>
<L>And dip thy plumage in the wat'ry skies,</L>
<L>Or moon-light wand'ring by the wave worn shore</L>
<L>Wait on old <HI>Ocean's</HI> melancholy roar:</L>
<L>Where'er thou art, once more my pray'r attend;</L>
<L>Once more celestial muse thy influence lend.</L>

<L>The muse delights to tune her grateful lay:</L>
<L>Glad science, thee, shall her Maecenas hail,</L>
<L>Wisdom shall smile and heav'nly truth prevail!</L>
<L>In yonder dome—it boasts no pompous name,</L>
<L>Yet not the less shall fill the page of fame,</L>
<L>Bright science dwells—how honoured the retreat,</L>
<L>Where science deigns to fix her fav'rite seat.</L>
<L>High from the throne she beams celestial day;</L>
<L>And distant lauds confess th' enliv'ning ray:</L>
<L>The graces ever in her presence stand</L>
<L>And virtue blooms beneath her nursing hand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>There first her youthful vot'ry learns to please</L>
<L>By just expression and becoming ease—</L>
<L>Delightful task, with early care to teach</L>
<L>The lisping tongue propriety of speech.</L>
<L>See on the stage the little hero stands,</L>
<L>With eyes uplifted, with extended hands:</L>
<L>Or from his lips Pope's liquid numbers flow,</L>
<L>In streams mellifluous—See the conscious glow</L>
<L>Burns on his cheek—perhaps the strains inspire</L>
<L>The infant raptures of poetic fire:</L>
<L>Perhaps 'tis modesty, with native grace,</L>
<L>Calls forth the roses in his youthful face:</L>

<L>And attic light'nings kindle in his eyes.</L>
<L>Methinks I see the deep touch'd senate glow</L>
<L>While mimic thunders threaten from his brow;</L>
<L>Or now his gentle voice in borrow'd lays,</L>
<L>Swells the smooth tribute of his Maker's praise:</L>
<L>See the warm ardor of the saint exprest,</L>
<L>As if the numbers fir'd his little breast:</L>

<L>Upward he lifts the astronomic eye,</L>
<L>Surveys those orbs of light that roll on high:</L>

<L>And learn th' important laws by which they move:</L>
<L>Sits in the centre, wrapt in thought profound,</L>
<L>And views the radiant system rolling round.</L>
<L>To reason's eye there shall the cause appear,</L>
<L>Why various seasons form the changing year:</L>
<L>Spring first in mantle green and garlands gay,</L>
<L>Sweet smelling as she passes, leads the way.</L>
<L>With breezy call awakes each rural sound,</L>
<L>And fills with music woods and valleys round:</L>
<L>Then <HI>Summer</HI> comes light clad in glowing red,</L>
<L>Whilst the thick foliage nods around her head:</L>
<L>With lavish bounty from her lap she pours,</L>
<L>Luxuriant gifts of herbage, fruits and flow'rs.</L>
<L>In yellow garb see <HI>Autumn</HI> next appear,</L>

<L>In icy bonds he holds the water's fall,</L>
<L>And in his snowy mantle wraps them all.</L>

<L>And in his works the <HI>Great Creator</HI> view:</L>
<L>The birds on pointed pinions mounting high,</L>
<L>That pour shrill music from the azure sky;</L>
<L>The fish that sporting in the lucid stream,</L>

<L>Rolling in clouds by summer breezes born,</L>
<L>Salute the traveller in shape of dust:</L>
<L>Whether in furnace or in noisy forge,</L>
<L>With fiend-like colliers thou vouchsafest to dwell,</L>
<L>And fix with Vulcan thy co-equal reign;</L>
<L>Or soft recline upon a scullion's lap,</L>
<L>Or on the school-boys jacket smile serene,</L>
</LG>

<L>Rebellious beaux, and washer-women strive,</L>
<L>But strive in vain with never ending war</L>
<L>To overcome thy pow'r—still thou return'st,</L>
<L>And still they labour on with fruitless toil,</L>
<L>Sworn foes to thee, thou sober-visag'd dame;</L>
<L>Not so thy bard—full well he knows to gain;</L>

<L>Oh! mortals blind to truth, whose anxious souls</L>

<L>Success no sooner crowns their wearied hope,</L>

<L>And cloud their joy; lest, in some guardless hour,</L>
<L>A dreaded spot should sully all their pride.</L>
</LG>

<L>See at the festive board in new brocade</L>
<L>And lawn, as yet unstain'd, Sophronia sits:</L>

<L>And pleasant vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nds smoke in vain around:</L>

<LG>
<L>THE Lord Supreme, from his exalted throne</L>

<L>Unutter'd thoughts deep in the heart conceal'd,</L>
<L>In strong expression stand to him reveal'd.</L>
<L>Thousands, and twice ten thousands ev'ry day,</L>
<L>To him or feign'd or real homage pay:</L>
<L>Like clouds of incense rolling to the skies,</L>
<L>In various forms their supplications r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se;</L>
<L>Their various forms with him can nought avail,</L>
<L>The secret motives only will prevail;</L>
<L>And the true source of ev'ry offer'd pray'r,</L>
<L>To his all-searching eye must plain appear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some place religion on a throne superb,</L>
<L>And deck with jewels her resplendant garb:</L>
<L>Painting and sculpture all their art display,</L>
<L>And lofty tapers dart their lucid ray:</L>
<L>High on the full-ton'd organ's buoyant sound,</L>

<L>And lift the soul to ecstacy divine.</L>

<L>And seek <HI>religion</HI> in the dark retreat:</L>
<L>In sable weeds you dress the heav'n-born maid,</L>
<L>And place her pensive in the lonely shade:</L>
<L>Recluse, unsocial <HI>you,</HI> your hours employ,</L>
<L>And fearful, banish ev'ry harmless joy.</L>

<LG>
<L>Each may be right in their peculiar way,</L>
<L>If proper motives should their worship sway:</L>
<L>If but the <HI>love divine of God</HI> is there,</L>
<L>The spirit genuine of unfeigned pray'r;</L>
<L>'Tis true devotion; and the Lord of love</L>
<L>Such pray'rs and praises kindly will approve.</L>
<L>Whether from golden altars they should rise,</L>
<L>And wrapt in sound, roll to the lofty skies,</L>
<L>Or from Ephrata's seat, so meek, so low,</L>
<L>The soft and silent aspirations flow.</L>

<HEAD>THE TREATY; A POEM<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This poem was written upon the banks of the river Lehigh, in the year 1761, when the author served as secretary in a solemn conference held between the government of Pennsylvania and the chiefs of several Indian nations.</NOTE>, Humbly inscribed to the honourable THOMAS and RICHARD PENN, proprietors of the province of Pennsylvania.</HEAD>

<L>'MID the deep murmur of luxuriant groves,</L>
<L>Waving o'er Lehigh's sylvan painted stream,</L>
<L>All fancy-fir'd, the muse retiring loves</L>
<L>Lonely to rove, wrapt in poetic theme.</L>
<L>Serpentine waters with majestic flow,</L>
<L>Now lost—now shining, lead th' astonish'd eye,</L>
<L>To distant scenes where endless forests grow,</L>
<L>And dusky mountains melt into the sky.</L>
<L>Gushing abruptly from between the hills</L>
<L>Far off is heard the plunging torrent's roar;</L>
<L>From massy rocks here the cool stream distills,</L>
<L>And gentle dashings sound along the shore.</L>
<L>The gay musicians of the groves around,</L>
<L>In cadence sweet attune their warbling song;</L>
<L>Their warbling song the darksome caves resound,</L>
<L>And light-wing'd breezes bear the strains along.</L>

<L>For thee, illustrious Penn! my song I raise,</L>

<L>And peace, content, and jollity were here.</L>
<L>Alas! how chang'd! the hospitable hearth</L>

<L>No more inspire the roar of rustic mirth,</L>
<L>When, with the setting day, its labours end.—</L>
<L>Alas! how chang'd! what a confused mass,</L>
<L>The scatter'd ruins of the cottage lie!</L>
<L>Here hissing serpents slide along the grass,</L>
<L>And here the owl lifts her distressful cry.</L>
<L>As calm and still the peaceful household lay,</L>
<L>At dead of night a savage yell was heard;</L>

<L>The captive lovers lock'd in close embrace,</L>

<HEAD>TO T— M—, ESQ.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>AS I sat by the fire, the newspaper read,</L>
<L>And waited for breakfast, my wife being in bed;</L>
<L>It came in my mind that I could not do better</L>
<L>Than to call for some paper, and write you a letter.</L>
<L>'Tis true I have nothing material to say,</L>
<L>But will mention what incidents fell in my way;</L>
<L>Our leaving <HI>Newcastle,</HI> and how we got hither,</L>
<L>Half tir'd to death, thro' wind and foul weather.</L>
<L>I mounted at nine, and set off on my journey,</L>
<L>Along with my brother-in-law the attorney;</L>
<L>Who took with him papers, so many and bulkly,</L>
<L>He found it convenient to ride in his sulky.</L>
<L>We travell'd, and chatted, and made ourselves merry,</L>
<L>And who should we meet a few miles from the ferry,</L>
<L>But the <HI>great little man:</HI> the justice I mean,</L>
<L>Rever'd and belov'd by the swains of <HI>Christeen.</HI></L>
<L>You know that at present, however, he labours</L>
<L>Beneath a sad quarrel with one of his neighbours;</L>
<L>And then to <HI>Newcastle</HI> was going to show</L>
<L>What homage the vulgar to justices owe.</L>
<L>He stopp'd us, and while we stood still in our places▪</L>
<L>Related his story, and cited some cases,</L>
<L>To prove how exceeding important the trust is,</L>
<L>And what veneration is due to a justice.</L>
<L><PB N="158" REF="024407_1177_0FC7270F387BB780"/>My brother assented, or seem'd to assent,</L>
<L>To all that was urg'd—away then he went,</L>
<L>Whilst we on our journey pursued as before,</L>
<L>Till we came to the ferryman's house on the shore.</L>
<L>Now this ferryman happen'd to be the vile brute</L>
<L>Who affronted his worship, and rais'd this dispute:</L>
<L>He likewise related his case to the lawyer</L>
<L>In such agitation, he work'd like a sawyer;</L>
<L>Whilst I stood impatient, unable to stir,</L>
<L>For his story was tedious, and caus'd a demur:</L>
<L>At length I exclaim'd—as I am a sinner,</L>
<L>We've no time to lose, we shall miss of our dinner:</L>
<L>But the man fully bent to wipe off his attainder,</L>
<L>Stept into the boat, and there told the remainder;</L>
<L>The lawyer assented, or seem'd to assent,</L>
<L>To all that was said—then forward we went.</L>
<L>Nothing afterwards happened that's worthy relating,</L>
<L>Till arrived at <HI>Chester,</HI> the place of our bating;</L>
<L>And here we divided, as was our intent;</L>
<L>At <HI>Cowpland</HI>'s he stopt, and to <HI>Withy</HI>'s I went:</L>
<L>Here the rooms were all full—nought but bustle and rout,</L>
<L>And over-grown booby-heads stalking about;</L>
<L>For this was the time when the lawyers resort,</L>
<L>From all quarters round to attend <HI>Chester</HI> court:</L>
<L>Attornies and clients here lovingly meet,</L>
<L>The one to be cheated, the other to cheat.</L>
</LG>

<L>"Her thanks and pray'rs she'll freely give,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Quite tir'd of nonsense, and noisy discourse,</L>
<L>I swallow'd my dinner, and mounted my horse:</L>
<L>But scarce had proceeded a mile on my way,</L>
<L>Before it turn'd out a very soul day;</L>
<L>The wind and the rain met me full in the face,</L>
<L>Yet I travell'd along at a pretty round pace;</L>
<L>Tho' I button'd up close, and flapp'd down my hat,</L>
<L>I was wet to the skin, like an half-drowned rat.</L>
<L>At length I got home, well pleas'd you may guess,</L>
<L>And by a great fire soon changed my dress.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now I suppose you may think by this time,</L>
<L>I have teiz'd you enough with my nonsense in rhyme:</L>
<L>Before I conclude—my compliments pay</L>
<L>To fat Mrs R—d, and to fair Mrs. C—y;</L>
<L>Remember me too to your neighbour V—e,</L>
<L>Tho' grey as a badger, and old as a weazel;</L>

<L>And justice M'W—m, that good-natur'd man;</L>
<L>To Johnny the barber, who hobbles about,</L>

<LG>
<L>GALLANTS attend and hear a friend,</L>
<L>Trill forth harmonious ditty,</L>
<L>Strange things I'll tell which late befel</L>
<L>In Philadelphia city.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twas early day, as poets say,</L>
<L>Just when the sun was rising,</L>
<L>A soldier stood on a log of wood,</L>
<L>And saw a thing surprising.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As in amaze he stood to gaze,</L>
<L>The truth can't be denied, sir,</L>
<L>He spied a score of kegs or more</L>
<L>Come floating down the tide, sir,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A sailor too in jerkin blue,</L>
<L>This strange appearance viewing,</L>
<L>First damn'd his eyes, in great surprise,</L>
<L>Then said some mischief's brewing.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="170" REF="024407_1189_0FC72761DFF84F98"/>
<L>These kegs, I'm told, the rebels bold,</L>
<L>Pack'd up like pickling herring;</L>
<L>And they're come down t' attack the town,</L>
<L>In this new way of ferrying.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The soldier flew, the sailor too,</L>
<L>And scar'd almost to death, sir,</L>
<L>Wore out their shoes, to spread the news,</L>
<L>And ran till out of breath, sir.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now up and down throughout the town,</L>
<L>Most frantic scenes were acted;</L>
<L>And some ran here, and others there,</L>
<L>Like men almost distracted.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some fire cry'd, which some denied,</L>
<L>But said the earth had quaked;</L>
<L>And girls and boys, with hideous noise,</L>
<L>Ran thro' the streets half naked.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sir William he, snug as a flea,</L>
<L>Lay all this time a snoring,</L>
<L>Nor dream'd of harm as he lay warm,</L>
<L>In bed with Mrs. L—g.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now in a fright, he starts upright,</L>
<L>Awak'd by such a clatter;</L>
<L>He rubs both eyes, and boldly cries,</L>
<L>For God's sake, what's the matter?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="171" REF="024407_1190_0FC7276304BC18E0"/>
<L>At his bed-side he then espy'd,</L>
<L>Sir Erskine at command, sir,</L>
<L>Upon one foot, he had one boot,</L>
<L>And th' other in his hand, sir.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Arise, arise, sir Erskine cries,</L>
<L>"The rebels—more's the pity,</L>
<L>"Without a boat are all afloat,</L>
<L>"And rang'd before the city.</L>

<L>"The motly crew, in vessels new,</L>

<L>"Or surely we despised shall be,</L>

<L>The royal band, now ready stand</L>
<L>All rang'd in dread array, sir,</L>
<L>With stomach stout to see it out,</L>
<L>And make a bloody day, sir.</L>
</LG>

<P>N. B. This ballad was occasioned by a real incident. Certain ma∣chines, in the form of kegs, charg'd with gun powder, were sent down the river to annoy the British shipping then at Philadelphia. The danger of these machines being discovered, the British manned the wharfs and shipping, and discharged their small arms and can∣nons at every thing they saw floating in the river during the ebb tide.</P>

<HEAD>THE MOST GRACIOUS ADDRESS OF ADMIRAL COLLIER AND GENERAL TRYON TO THE PEOPLE OF CONNECTICUT.—
<DATE>JULY, 1779.</DATE></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHAT can ye hope, rebellious crew,</L>
<L>But vengeance dire to traitors due;</L>
<L>Whilst you support this insurrection,</L>
<L>Refusing to our king subjection?</L>
<L>Why so ungen'rous, so unkind?</L>
<L>Why to your own true int'rest blind?</L>
<L>'Tis fact—and take it on our word,</L>
<L>If you'll submit to George the Third,</L>
<L>You'll surely find it better far</L>
<L>Than carrying on this bloody war▪</L>
<L>You'll only be of slaves a nation,</L>
<L>From generation to generation:</L>
<L>And what is that, compar'd with all</L>
<L>The mischiefs which may now befal,</L>
<L>If you unwisely still persist in</L>
<L>This naughty practice of resisting.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Your towns, yourselves, you can't deny,</L>
<L>Within the grasp of power lie:</L>
<L>And that we can with greatest ease,</L>
<L>Clap paw upon you when we please.</L>
<L><PB N="182" REF="024407_1201_0FC72250A8C42C28"/>That you've a house to put your head in,</L>
<L>Have pots or kettles, beds or bedding,</L>
<L>Is to our great forbearance owing,</L>
<L>And tender mercy ever flowing.</L>
<L>What you, presumptuous, call your own,</L>
<L>You only have from us on loan;</L>
<L>And if we ask it back again,</L>
<L>You know resistance would be vain.</L>
<L>Therefore your houses, goods, and land,</L>
<L>As monuments of mercy stand:</L>
<L>But we're in hopes you now begin</L>
<L>To see, and soon will own your sin:</L>
<L>The very continent we're told<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide the orginal address, of which this is in substance a just translation throughout.</NOTE></L>
<L>Begins to blush, tho' late so bold;</L>
<L>Conscious of many heinous crimes,</L>
<L>And therefore would repent by times.</L>
<L>And you, who thus at mercy lie,</L>
<L>Should first to our protection fly:</L>
<L>And save yourselves from fell perdition,</L>
<L>The sure reward of black sedition.</L>
<L>Would you submit, 'twould be a sample</L>
<L>For others—and the good example</L>
<L>Might draw in many worthy folks</L>
<L>To poke their necks into our yokes;</L>
<L>And so become—oh! blessed thing,</L>
<L>The slaves of our most gracious king.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now we think it not amiss</L>
<L>To leave you to reflect on this:</L>
<L><PB N="183" REF="024407_1202_0FC722592249BD90"/>And do most graciously dcelare,</L>
<L>That we will all those culprits spare,</L>
<L>Who stay at home in peace and quiet,</L>
<L>Disclaiming this unnat'ral riot;</L>
<L>We'll spare their dwellings—and what more is,</L>
<L>Be kind as Howe to Jersey tories:</L>
<L>Yet rebels of the military,</L>
<L>Must still remain in sad quandary;</L>
<L>And those who fill departments civil,</L>
<L>Will sure go headlong to the devil;</L>
<L>Unless they will their follies own,</L>
<L>And pardon ask on marrow-bone.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But do not think, because we're kind,</L>
<L>We may be always of one mind;</L>
<L>And that our goodness has no end,</L>
<L>Because as yet we've been your friend:</L>
<L>Should you perversely still proceed,</L>
<L>We shall be very wroth indeed;</L>
<L>And when we're angry—you know what—</L>
<L>Connecticut must go to pot.</L>
<L>Too late you'll find yourselves mistaken,</L>
<L>And not a man will save his bacon:</L>
<L>Therefore beware—you may rely on</L>
<L>The words of <HI>Collier</HI> and of <HI>Tryon.</HI></L>

<L>Between those cheeks, protuberant arose,</L>
<L>In form triangular, her lovely nose,</L>
<L>Like EGYPT's pyramid it seem'd to rise,</L>
<L>Scorn earth, and bid defiance to the skies;</L>
<L>Thin were her lips, and of a sallow hue,</L>
<L>Her open mouth expos'd her teeth to view;</L>
<L>Projecting strong, protuberant and wide</L>
<L>Stood <HI>incisores</HI>—and on either side</L>
<L>The <HI>canine</HI> rang'd, with many a beauteous flaw,</L>
<L>And last the <HI>grinders,</HI> to fill up the jaw—</L>
<L>All in their <HI>alveoli</HI> fix'd secure,</L>
<L>Articulated by <HI>gomphosis</HI> sure.</L>
<L>Around her mouth, perpetual smiles had made</L>
<L>Wrinkles wherein the loves and graces play'd;</L>
<L>There, stretch'd and rigid by continual strain,</L>
<L>Appear'd the <HI>zygomatic</HI> muscles plain,</L>
<L><PB N="200" REF="024407_1219_0FC7228B5BA86DD8"/>And broad <HI>montanus</HI> o'er her peeked chin</L>
<L>Extended to support the heav'nly grin.</L>
<L>In amorous dalliance of I stroak'd her arm,</L>
<L>Each rising muscle was a rising charm.</L>
<L>O'er the <HI>flexores</HI> my fond fingers play'd,</L>
<L>I found instruction with delight convey'd—</L>
<L>There <HI>carpus, cubitus</HI> and <HI>radius</HI> too</L>
<L>Were plainly felt and manifest to view.</L>
<L>No muscles on her lovely hand were seen,</L>
<L>But only bones envelop'd by a skin.</L>
<L>Long were her fingers and her knuckles bare,</L>
<L>Much like the claw-foot of a walnut chair.</L>
<L>So plain was complex <HI>metacarpus</HI> shewn</L>
<L>It might be fairly counted bone by bone.</L>
<L>Her slender <HI>phalanxes</HI> were well defin'd,</L>
<L>And each with each by <HI>ginglymus</HI> combin'd.</L>
<L>Such were the charms that did my fancy fire</L>
<L>And love—chaste scientific love inspire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AT length my CADAVERA fell beneath</L>
<L>The fatal stroke of all subduing death—</L>
<L>Three days in grief—three nights in tears I spent,</L>
<L>And sighs incessant gave my sorrows vent.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FEW are th' examples of a love so true—</L>
<L>Ev'n from her death I consolation drew,</L>
<L>And in a secret hour approach'd her grave</L>
<L>Resolv'd her precious corse from worms to save;</L>
<L>With active haste remov'd the incumbent clay,</L>
<L>Seiz'd the rich prize and bore my love away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="201" REF="024407_1220_0FC7228D4C029D90"/>
<L>HER naked charms now lay before my sight,</L>
<L>I gaz'd with rapture and supreme delight,</L>
<L>Nor could forbear, in ecstasy, to cry—</L>
<L>Beneath that shrivell'd skin what treasures lie!</L>
<L>Then feasted to the full my amorous soul,</L>
<L>And skinn'd and cut and slash'd without controul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'TWAS then I saw, what long I'd wish'd to see,</L>
<L>That heart which panted oft for love and me—</L>
<L>In detail view'd the form I once ador'd,</L>
<L>And nature's hidden mysteries explor'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>ALAS! too truly did the wise man say</L>
<L>That flesh is grass, and subject to decay—</L>
<L>Not so the bones—of substance firm and hard</L>
<L>Long they remain th' anatomist's reward.</L>
<L>Wise nature, in her providential care,</L>
<L>Did, kindly, bones from vile corruption spare,</L>
<L>That sons their fathers' skeletons might have</L>
<L>And heav'n born science triumph o'er the grave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>MY true love's bones I boil'd—from fat and lean</L>
<L>These hands industrious scrap'd them fair and clean,</L>
<L>And every bone did to its place restore,</L>
<L>As nature's hand had placed them long before;</L>
<L>These fingers twisted ev'ry pliant wire</L>
<L>With patient skill, urg'd on by strong desire.</L>
<L>Now what remains of CADAVERA's mine,</L>
<L>Securely hanging in a case of pine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>OFTTIMES I sit and contemplate her charms,</L>
<L>Her nodding skull and her long dangling arms,</L>
<L>'Till quite inflam'd with passion for the dead</L>
<L>I take her beauteous skeleton to bed—</L>
<L>There stretch'd, at length, close to my faithful side</L>
<L>She lies all night a lovely grinning bride.—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="202" REF="024407_1221_0FC7228ECB6D79E0"/>
<L>EXCUSE, my friends, this detail of my love,</L>
<L>You must th' intent, if not the tale approve;</L>
<L>By facts exemplary I meant to shew</L>
<L>To what extent a genuine zeal will go.</L>
<L>A mind, so fix'd, will not be drawn aside</L>
<L>By vain dissentions or a partial pride;</L>
<L>But ev'ry hostile sentiment subdue</L>
<L>And keep the ruling passion still in view.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FALSE delicacy—prejudices strong,</L>
<L>Which no distinctions know 'twixt right and wrong,</L>
<L>Against our noble science spend their rage</L>
<L>And mark th' ignorance of this vulgar age.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>TIME was, when men their living flesh would spare</L>
<L>And to the knife their quiv'ring <HI>nates</HI> bare,</L>
<L>That skilful surgeons noses might obtain</L>
<L>For noses lost—and cut and come again—</L>
<L>But now the <HI>living</HI> churlishly refuse</L>
<L>To give their dead relations to our use;</L>
<L>Talk of decorum—and a thousand whims—</L>
<L>Whene'er we hack their wives' or daughters' limbs;</L>
<L>And yet their tables daily they supply</L>
<L>With the rich fruits of sad mortality;</L>
<L>Will pick, and gut and cook a chicken's corse,</L>
<L>Dissect and eat it up without remorse;</L>
<L>Devouring fish, flesh, fowl, whatever comes,</L>
<L>Nor fear the ghosts of murder'd hecatombs.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now where's the difference?—to th' impartial eye</L>
<L>A leg of mutton and a human thigh</L>
<L>Are just the same—for surely all must own</L>
<L>Flesh is but flesh, and bone is only bone;</L>
<L><PB N="203" REF="024407_1222_0FC72290C26236D8"/>And tho' indeed, some flesh and bone may grow</L>
<L>To make a monkey—some to make a beau,</L>
<L>Still the materials are the same, we know.</L>
<L>Nor can our anatomic knowledge trace</L>
<L>Internal marks distinctive of our race.—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHENCE, then, these loud complaints—these hosts of foes</L>
<L>Combin'd our useful labours to oppose?</L>
<L>How long shall foolish prejudices reign?</L>
<L>And when shall reason her just empire gain?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AH! full of danger is the up-hill road,</L>
<L>That leads the youth to learning's high abode:</L>
<L>His way thick mists of vulgar errors blind,</L>
<L>And sneering satire follows close behind;</L>
<L>Sour envy strews the rugged path with thorns,</L>
<L>And lazy ignorance his labour scorns.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>IS this a time, ye brethren of the knife,</L>
<L>For civil contest and internal strife?</L>
<L>When loud against us gen'ral clamours cry,</L>
<L>And persecution lifts her lash on high?</L>
<L>When government—that many headed beast—</L>
<L>Against our practice rears her horrid crest,</L>
<L>And, our nocturnal access to oppose,</L>
<L>Around the dead a penal barrier <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A law past at New-York, making it penal to steal bodies from the burial ground.</NOTE> throws?</L>
<L>To crush our schools her awful pow'r applies,</L>
<L>And ev'n forbids the gibbet's just supplies. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The wheelbarrow of Pennsylvania.</NOTE></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>YET in this night of darkness, storms and fears,</L>
<L>Behold one bright benignant star <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The Medical College.</NOTE> appears—</L>
<L><PB N="204" REF="024407_1223_0FC722958C6ECCE0"/>Long may it shine, and, e'er it's course is run,</L>
<L>Increase▪ in size and splendour, to a sun!—</L>

<L>And like a planet, <HI>death</HI> arou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> him roll.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>METHINKS I see a stately fabric rise,</L>
<L>Rear'd on the skulls of these our enemies:</L>
<L>I see the bones of our invet'rate foes</L>
<L>Hang round its walls in scientific rows.</L>
<L><HI>There</HI> solemn sit the learned of the day</L>
<L>Dispensing death with uncontrouled sway,</L>
<L>And by <HI>prescription</HI> regulate with ease</L>
<L>The sudden crisis or the slow disease.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THEN shall physicians their millenium find,</L>
<L>And reign the real sov'reigns of mankind:</L>
<L>Then shall the face of this vile world be chang'd—</L>
<L>And nature's healthful laws all new arrang'd—</L>
<L>In min'ral powders all her dust shall rise,</L>
<L>And all her insects shall be Spanish flies:</L>
<L>In medicated potions streams shall flow,</L>
<L>Pills fall in hail-storms, and sharp salts in snow;</L>
<L>In ev'ry quagmire bolusses be found,</L>
<L>And slimy cataplasms spread the ground—</L>
<L>Nature herself assume the chymist's part,</L>
<L>And furnish poisons unsublim'd by art.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THEN to our schools shall wealth in currents flow,</L>
<L>Our theatres no want of subjects know;</L>
<L>Nor laws nor mobs th' Anatomist shall dread,</L>
<L>For graves shall freely render up their dead.</L>
