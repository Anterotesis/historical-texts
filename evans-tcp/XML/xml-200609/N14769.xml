<HEAD>NEW-YEAR VERSES, FOR THOSE WHO CARRY THE <HI>PENNSYLVANIA</HI> GAZETTE TO THE CUSTOMERS. <HI>JANUARY,</HI> 1, 1784.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>HOW Things have chang'd since last New-Year,</L>
<L>What dismal Prospects then arose!</L>
<L>Scarce at your Doors I dar'd appear,</L>
<L>So multifarious were our Woes:</L>
<L>But Time at length has chang'd the Scene,</L>
<L>Our Prospects now are more serene.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Bad News we brought you every Day,</L>
<L>Your Seamen slain, your Ships on Shore,</L>
<L>The Army fretting for their Pay—</L>
<L>'Twas well they had not fretted more!</L>
<L>'Twas wrong indeed to wear out Shoes,</L>
<L>To bring you nothing but bad News.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now let's be joyful for the change—</L>
<L>The Folks that guard the <HI>English</HI> Throne</L>
<L>Have giv'n us ample Room to range,</L>
<L>And more, perhaps, than was their own;</L>
<L>To Western Lakes they stretch our Bounds,</L>
<L>And yield the <HI>Indian</HI> Hunting Grounds.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But pray read on another Year,</L>
<L>Remain the humble News-man's Friend;</L>
<L>And he'll engage to let you hear</L>
<L>What <HI>Europe</HI>'s Princes next intend.—</L>
<L>E'en now their Brains are all at work,</L>
<L>To rouse the <HI>Russian</HI> on the <HI>Turk.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Well—if they fight, then fight they must,</L>
<L>They are a strange, contentious Breed;</L>
<L>One good Effect will be, I trust,</L>
<L>The more that's kill'd, the more you'll read;</L>
<L>For <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Experience <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lly shews,</L>
<L>THAT WRANGLING IS THE LIFE OF NEWS.</L>
