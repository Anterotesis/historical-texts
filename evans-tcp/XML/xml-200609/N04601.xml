<Q><HI>For we dare not make ourselves of the Number, or compare ourselves with some that command themselves: but they measuring themselves by them∣selves, and comparing themselves amongst themselves, are not wise.—Not boasting of Things without our Measure, of other Men's Labour,—in another Man's Line, of Things made ready to our Hand. For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.</HI></Q>

<HEAD>A LETTER</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>To the Reverend Mr. George Whitefield, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE have received your Answer to our Testimony, and have read it, we hope with unprejudic'd Attention. We agree with you in thinking, that <HI>the great Governour of the Church beckoned to you by his Providence to Answer for your self.</HI> And we apprehend he had done so long before our Testi∣mony was made publick. But we cannot perswade our selves, that your Answer is such a one, as this <HI>great Governour</HI> might justly have expec∣ted, in some important Instances.</P>
<P>You think our Charges against you are ill grounded. <HI>We</HI> still be∣lieve, that we had good Reason for them <HI>all,</HI> when we publish'd them; and that you have done but very little to remove the Reasons, by which almost <HI>any of them</HI> were supported. Let us consider the several Articles in the Fear of God, and try if we can't get nearer to one another in our Sentiments.</P>
<P>THE first Thing we charge you with is <HI>Enthusiasm.</HI> This we take to be a Charge of an higher Nature, than perhaps People are generally a∣ware of. They who are unacquainted with the Histories of former Ages, and so strangers to the Mischiefs which <HI>Enthusiasm</HI> hath often brought up∣on both <HI>States</HI> and <HI>Churches,</HI> may be too apt to think it a pretty harmless Thing; and may fancy an <HI>Enthusiastick Turn</HI> to be an <HI>Innocent Weakness,</HI> to which none but good Men are liable. But all who duly consider the natural Tendency of this cast of Mind, and are acquainted with the out∣ragious
<PB N="4" REF="005715_0003_1026933BA3C11768"/>
Acts of Wickedness, which Men have been frequently led into by it, cannot but dread and set themselves vigorously to oppose its very first Appearances.</P>
<P>IT we consider <HI>the Nature of Enthusiastic,</HI> which is to make a Man imagine, that almost any Tho't which bears strongly upon his Mind (whether it came into it by <HI>Dream, Suggestion,</HI> or whatever other Way) is from the Spirit of God; when at the same Time he hath no Proof that it is; it will plainly appear to be a very dangerous Thing. For if a Man believes the Tho't which bears upon his Mind, to be from the Spirit of God, he must think it his Duty to conduct himself agreably to it. And yet if he hath no Proof, that such a Tho't is from the Spirit of God, it may be, for any Thing he knows to the contrary, only the Off spring of his own Brain, or perhaps a Suggestion of the wicked One. And yet so long as he believes it to be of divine Original, he must subject his Rea∣son to it; and if any Text of Scripture seems to thwart it, it will be strange, if he don't force such a Meaning upon <HI>that</HI> also, as shall make it correspond with the Suggestion which he believes to be from God. So that a Man of an <HI>Enthusiastick Turn</HI> is likely to have but little Help in his Conduct, either from his own Reason or from the Holy Scriptures, whenever a Tho't from some other Quarter rushes strongly into his Mind, or lieth much upon it. And what Wonder will it be, if Men in such a Case, are led on insensibly, till they have <HI>put away a good Consci∣ence,</HI> and <HI>concerning Faith have made Shipwrack</HI> in a most surprising Manner.</P>
<P>AND such hath been found by sad Experience to be the Fruit of <HI>En∣thusiasm,</HI> in all Ages of the Christian Church. But we shall only men∣tion two or three Instances, looking no farther back than the Times of the happy Reformation from <HI>Popery:</HI> Soon after the Beginning of which arose in <HI>Germany,</HI> about the Years 1522 and 1524, <HI>Nicholas Stork, Thomas Muncer, Henry Pfeiffer,</HI> and others, who under the Conduct of <HI>Dreams, Impulses of the Spirit,</HI> and at length <HI>Visions,</HI> declared, That <HI>Luther's</HI> carnal and literal Gospel was worse than the <HI>Pope;</HI> cried down Books and the Letter of Scripture, and said the Spirit was Leader and Rule to Believers; called Christian Magistrates New-Testament Task∣Masters; and to pull them down and bring all Men upon a Level, stirred up such a cruel Civil War, as cost the Lives of more than one Hundred Thousand Persons. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of the Spiritual Antichrist, P. 6, 7.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="005715_0004_1026933E48173678"/>
ANOTHER surprizing Instance of the violent Influence and mischie∣vous Effect of an <HI>Enthusiastick</HI> Spirit, was seen in our own Nation. Anno 1661 among the People then called <HI>Fifth Monarchy-Men.</HI></P>
<P>THESE being intoxicated with the Notion of a <HI>New Monarchy</HI> to be set up, in which <HI>Christ was to Rule,</HI> and the <HI>Saints only were to exercise Dominion under Him,</HI> got a Declaration printed, entitled, <HI>A Door of Hope opened;</HI> in which they said, that they would never sheath their Swords till <HI>Babilon,</HI> as they called Monarchy, became a <HI>Hissing and a Curse,</HI> and there be left <HI>neither Remnant, Son, nor Nephew:</HI> That when they had led <HI>Captivity Captive in England,</HI> they would go into <HI>France, Spain, Ger∣many,</HI> &amp;c. and rather dye than take the wicked Oaths of <HI>Supremacy</HI> and <HI>Allegiance:</HI> That they would not make any League with Monarchists, but would rise up against the <HI>carnal</HI> to possess the <HI>Gate, to bind their Kings in Chains, and their Nobles in Fetters of Iron.</HI>—In Pursuance of this Declaration, on the Lord's Day Evening, <HI>Jan.</HI> 6th. 1660, 61. hav∣ing been fully animated by the Sermon, which hinted to them, that <HI>they had been praying and preaching, but not acting for God;</HI> they fallied out, about fifty of them, well armed, from their Meeting-House, into the Streets of <HI>London;</HI> killed a poor innocent Man, who, upon Demand, had answered, <HI>He was for God and the King;</HI> desperately fought, and routed great Part of the City Train'd Bands, who had taken the Alarm; and then march'd off, and retired to a Wood about two Miles from the City: On Wednesday Morning they returned into <HI>London</HI> again, being assured by their Leader, that <HI>no Weapon formed against them should pros∣per: Therefore they might look upon the Example of Gideon. It was the same Thing to God, whether be saved by Few or by a Multitude.</HI> And now, after having been once dispersed, they gather'd again, and fought with so much Fury, that they ruffled some Train'd Bands, and repelled the King's Horse Guards, who came to assist them. And tho' at last they were with much ado overborn by Numbers, yet they could not be subdued, till near half of them were killed upon the Spot. They who were taken, blasphemously pleaded, <HI>that if they were deceived or misted, 'twas God who deceived them.</HI> And <HI>Venner,</HI> a Wine-Cooper, who had been both their Preacher and their Leader in these desperate Encounters, after Sentence pronounced against him, when the Lord Chief Justice seriously charged him with the Blood of his unhappy Accomplices, re∣plied with the true Spirit of <HI>Enthusiasm,</HI> that <HI>it was not be, but Jesus that led them.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>Echard'</HI>s History. P. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE>—We have mentioned these sad Instances of the outra∣gious
<PB N="6" REF="005715_0005_1026933FDD1C9F18"/>
Acts of Wickedness, to which Men have sometimes, been led by an <HI>Enthusiastick</HI> Temper, for the Warning of those who dont so well know, as you, <HI>Sir,</HI> ought to do, the extream Danger of such a Turn of Mind.</P>
<P>WE shall take Notice of but one Instance more, among the Multitudes which might be rehearsed; for hardly any Age of the Christian Church hath passed without them: And tho' the Instance which we shall now pitch upon, did not end so tragically as the two already mentioned; yet <HI>Enthusiasm</HI> in this proved as destructive to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> as it did to a <HI>good Conscience</HI> in the two former. And we the rather speak of this, because the World bath never yet had any publick Account of it. And we our selves very sensibly felt its ill Effects, in the Society under our Care, not more than Ten Years ago; when a Gentleman, who had been permitted to teach the <HI>French Tongue</HI> in the <HI>College,</HI> where he had be∣haved himself to all Appearance unblameably, at length began to give too much heed to certain <HI>Dreams,</HI> which he supposed to be of <HI>Divine Original.</HI> And when once he had gotten his Imagination thoro'ly hozted with these, be soon began to fancy himself favoured frequently with <HI>Visitors</HI> too; and these sometimes attended with <HI>articulate Voices</HI> to instruct him in the Divine Meaning and Design of them. Upon this he very industriously, tho' with as little Observation as he could, endeavoured to propagate among his intimate Friends, several strange and pernicious Doctrines; such as the unlawfulness of Magistracy among Christians, and consequently of any temporal Punishments for evil Doers, from Men; that Punishment from God in the Future State would be sure not be eternal, nor any other, nor perhaps more, even for a Time, than what wicked Men now suffer in this World, by being abandoned to the outrage of their own and others Passions, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> That a standing Mi∣nistry, Ordinances, the Christian Sabbath, and Social Worship, were all without Warrant from the New-Testament: That, beside our blessed Lord of the Tribe of <HI>Judah,</HI> who was in his Account but a <HI>meer Crea∣ture,</HI> (if not a <HI>meer Man</HI>) there was quickly to be expected a <HI>second Messiah</HI> of the Tribe of <HI>Ephraim,</HI> who is <HI>the Shepherd the Stone of Israel,</HI> spoken of <HI>Gen.</HI> 49. 24. And the Person <HI>like the Son of Man, whom Daniel saw in the Night Visions, to whom there was given Dominion and Glory, and a Kingdom,</HI> &amp;c. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dan.</HI> 9. 13, 14.</NOTE> that this Person was then in Being; that he had been often presented to <HI>him</HI> in <HI>Vision,</HI> and was one whom he knew
<PB N="7" REF="005715_0006_1026934333505E28"/>
very well. And tho' he declined telling who he was, under Pretence of wanting a Permission for it; yet, by many Circumstances it appeared highly probable, that he himself was the Man; in his own Conceit. Nor was his being by Birth <HI>a French Man,</HI> an Objection of Force enough to be set in Opposition to his <HI>heavenly Visions;</HI> for Multitudes in the World (as he said) are undoubtedly of <HI>Israelitish Extract,</HI> who are not known to be so, either by themselves or others. And since the Posteri∣ty of <HI>Jacob</HI> have utterly lost their <HI>Genealogies,</HI> it was impossible that <HI>Ben Ephraim</HI> should know his own Descent, otherwise than by Revela∣tion; or be able to make it out to others, but by the Gifts of Pro∣phesy and Miracles.</P>
<P>AND these Gifts, he once and again before very credible Witness, de∣clared, that he knew by Revelation he should shortly <HI>be endued with from on High,</HI> in as great a Degree as ever the Apostles were, to say nothing more.</P>
<P>THESE extraordinary Things <HI>Monsieur</HI> did not broach all at once; but by little and little; the most plausible of them, or rather some plau∣sible Deductions from them, first, and only to such (as to use his own Expression) he found of a <HI>teachable Spirit;</HI> till at length the Secrets were imparted to too many to remain such any longer.</P>
<P>THE Propagator of them now <HI>waxed bold,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Longed to suffer Persecution.</NOTE> professed the strongest Assurance imaginable of the <HI>Divine</HI> Original of his <HI>Dreams</HI> and <HI>Visions,</HI> and of the <HI>sacred Truths</HI> of those <HI>Doctrines</HI> and <HI>Interpretations of Scrip∣ture</HI> which he had by these Means been led into; and sometimes went so far as to declare, that if the Event should prove these Things to be Delusions, he should doubt, for his part, whether God had ever made any <HI>Revelations</HI> at all to Men.</P>
<P>WE soon perceived, that too great a Respect was paid, by several in our Society, and elsewhere, to his Pretences to <HI>Visions</HI> and <HI>Revelations;</HI> that one of his greatest Confidents began to be favoured with <HI>Visions</HI> too, in his own Conceit; and that others were in suspence, whether he might not be a Teacher sent from God; and waited with some Impatience to see him begin to prove his Mission, and were likely to take up with Evidences slight enough.</P>
<P>AS the Gentlemàn's Notions were now no longer Privacies, it soon appeared, that they had been industriously spread by some, among their Friends, in Places far and near; that many People's Minds were greatly
<PB N="8" REF="005715_0007_1026934661F5F458"/>
moved with them; and strange Apprehensions and Expectations raised, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> what these Things would come to.</P>
<P>IT would be beside our present Business to relate by what Means, thro' the good Providence of God, it was at length made manifest, that these high Pretences to extraordinary <HI>Divine Communications</HI> were all <HI>meer Delusions;</HI> and so the Minds of People again quieted.</P>
<P>IT would be of more Importance to remark, what was the End of these Things with respect to the <HI>Enthusiastick</HI> Gentleman himself; name∣ly, That when he began to be <HI>exalted above Measure, with the abundance of his</HI> imaginary <HI>Revelations,</HI> he withdrew himself entirely from the publick Worship of God, which he before diligently (and so far as ap∣peared) devoutly used to attend; and he has since returned to the Idola∣tries of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> from which he had professed himself a sincere Convert.</P>
<P>AND now, <HI>Sir,</HI> having had such a flagrant Instance, so very lately, among ourselves, of the pernicious Tendency of an <HI>Enthusiastick</HI> Turn of Mind; you cannot wonder at it, if we are alarm'd ourselves, and if we give faithful Warning of their Danger to our Neighbours, when we see any Man of publick Character and Influence <HI>giving heed to Dreams, Suggestions, Impulses,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>as from the Spirit of God,</HI> without being able to prove them to be of such Original. And this, <HI><ABBR>Rev.</ABBR> Sir,</HI> you must give us Leave to tell you, we still think to be your Case, notwithstand∣ing all you have said in your Letter to us, to clear your self from the Charge.</P>
<P>WE shall speak first concerning your <HI>Dreams,</HI> the first of which you mention in your Life, P. 12. and is, <HI>that you was to see God on Mount Sinai, but was afraid to meet him.</HI> We should not have tho't this worth our Notice, tho' you apprehended it deserved a Place in your Account <HI>of God's Dealings with you,</HI> if it had not been followed with others, in which an <HI>Enthusiastick</HI> Temper appears more evidently. We are far from blaming you for making a pious Improvement of the Surprize which this Dream might give you: But if it <HI>made a great Impression up∣on you,</HI> (as you say it did) because you believed it to be a <HI>Divine,</HI> and not a <HI>Natural</HI> Dream; then we think you fondly imagined <HI>that</HI> to be from the Spirit of God, which you could not prove to be so; but on the contrary, before you published your Life, had sufficient Evidence that it was not. For the Dream had not then, after so many years been verified; and we are perswaded that you did not then believe, that it ever would; and therefore had no Reason to think it to be from the
<PB N="9" REF="005715_0008_10269348B4A5B8E0"/>
Spirit of God, who is the Spirit of Truth; but had Reason enough to conclude the contrary.</P>
<P>YOUR next <HI>Dream</HI> you give us the following Account of in your Life, P. 39, 40. <Q>I prayed most earnestly, that God would open a Door for me to Visit the Prisoners here also. [at <HI>Gloucester</HI>] Quickly after I dreamt, <HI>that one of the Prisoners came to be instructed by me</HI>—The Dream was much impressed upon my Heart. In the Morning I went to the Door of the County Goal, I knock'd, no Body came to open it, I tho't the Hour was not yet come.—I waited still upon God in Prayer; and in some Months came a Letter from a Friend at <HI>Oxford,</HI> desiring me to go to one <HI>Pebworth,</HI> who had broken out of <HI>Oxford</HI> Goal, and was retaken at <HI>Gloucester:</HI>—As soon as I had read this Letter, it was <HI>suggested</HI> to me, that my Prayer was now answered. Immediately I went to the Prison, <HI>assuredly gathering that the Lord called me thither.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THIS Dream, you say in your Letter to us, P. 5. <Q>was no farther a Reason of my going thither [to the Goal] than as it was a Means of exciting me to pursue the reasonable Inclination I had before. And subsequent Providences made me afterwards judge that God directed the Dream for that Purpose.</Q></P>
<P>UPON this Account of the Matter, we would observe, that <HI>here are the strongest Appearances of your taking this Dream to be from God, before you could have any Reason to judge it so, from subsequent Providences.</HI>—For you was more influenced by this, than by the Dictates of your own Reason and Conscience. You acknowledge that your <HI>Inclination</HI> to visit the Prisoners, was a <HI>reasonable one before you had your Dream.</HI> And you prayed most earnestly that God would open a Door for it: And when you had commended the Case to God, and had begged his Help and Blessing on your Endeavours, what hindered you from pursuing your <HI>reasonable Inclinations?</HI> What need of waiting for a <HI>Dream</HI> or a <HI>Suggestion</HI> to excite you to that, which you was inclined to upon good Reason (as you tho't) already? Would the Goaler have denied you Ad∣mittance, if you had asked it, till you could come to him with the Au∣thority of a <HI>Dream,</HI> or a <HI>Suggestion?</HI> And yet you sat still till you Dreams, <HI>That one of the Prisoners came to be instructed by you:</HI> Upon which away you go in the Morning. And did you not at that Time (as well as afterwards) <HI>assuredly gather that the Lord called you thither?</HI> But you don't tell us of this, because when you came to the Door of the Goal an knocked, behold, it was a <HI>meer Dream,</HI> of <HI>Natural</HI> and not
<PB REF="005715_0009_1026934A4CEF4B68"/>
of <HI>Divine</HI> Original: For <HI>no Body came to open to you!</HI> However, you seem to have settled it in your Heart from this <HI>Dream,</HI> that there was an <HI>Hour</HI> appointed by God, for your visiting the Prisoners; but <HI>that it was not yet come.</HI> And your collecting this from your <HI>Dream,</HI> together with your paying more Respect to <HI>That</HI> than to the Dictates of your own Reason, plainly shews, that you then imagined the <HI>Dream</HI> to be from God, before you had Reason to judge it so, from any subsequent Providence. For the Event hitherto was directly against such a Sup∣position.</P>
<P>Now you sat still again, without any appearance of Reason for it, <HI>whole Months together;</HI> and probably would have continued so to do, notwithstanding your <HI>reasonable Inclination</HI> to visit the poor Prisoners, if it had not at length been <HI>suggested</HI> to you, <HI>that your Prayer was now answered.</HI> And pray, <HI>Sir,</HI> why might you not as well have told your Readers, that it took you in the Head to fancy so? For what Reason have you to think, that you might not at twenty other Times, during the <HI>Months</HI> wherein you sat still, have as easily obtained Admission, and done as much Good among the Prisoners, as after you say it was <HI>sug∣gested</HI> to you, <HI>that your Prayer was now answered?</HI> We believe you will hardly tell us, <Q>that you consulted the <HI>Word of God</HI> on this Occasion, and was from thence as plainly directed at that Time to sit still, not∣withstanding your <HI>Dream,</HI> till it should be <HI>suggested</HI> to you <HI>that your Prayer was answered,</HI> as tho' you had consulted the <HI>Urim</HI> and <HI>Thumm∣im</HI> which was upon the <HI>High Priest's</HI> Breast, as you affirm every spiritual Reader of holy Writ may be directed at all Times, in your Sermon of <HI>Searching the Scriptures,</HI> P. 146, 147.</Q>—But if you say this was the Case, we expect you should tell us, what that remarkable Passage of Scripture was, which gave you such clear Direction in <HI>these minute Circumstances.</HI> And till you produce the Passage, and show how you drew the Knowledge of your Duty from it, you must not take it amiss if we conclude, that you <HI>governed</HI> yourself in this Affair much more by a <HI>Dream</HI> and a <HI>Suggestion,</HI> than by your own <HI>Reason</HI> and the <HI>Word of God.</HI> And that this <HI>Dream,</HI> as well as the former, was from the work∣ing of your own Imagination, and not from the Spirit of God. For did the <HI>Prisoner,</HI> who was presented to you in the <HI>Dream,</HI> come for Instruc∣tion <HI>then,</HI> or not till <HI>some Months after?</HI> If he came for Instruction to be given <HI>some Months after,</HI> why did you go to the Prison the <HI>next Morn∣ing?</HI> If he came for <HI>present Instruction,</HI> the Event shewed that it was not of God.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="005715_0010_1026934CA58E1AF0"/>
ONE <HI>Dream</HI> more you give us an Account of in your Life, P. 43. <HI>One Night you Dreamed, that you was talking with the Bishop in his Palace,</HI> and <HI>that he gave you some Gold, which chinked in your Hands.</HI>—Upon which we observe, that tho' it may be true (as you tell us in the same Page) that before the Bishop sent for you, you always checkt the strong Perswasion which frequently rose in your Mind from this <HI>Dream,</HI> that you should shortly go to his Lordship; yet it is certainly true also, that afterwards when you wrote the <HI>Account of Gods dealings with you,</HI> you be∣lieved this <HI>Dream</HI> to have been from God. For you expresly say, <HI>Before I conversed with his Lordship, God was pleased to give me previous Notice of it,</HI> by this <HI>Dream.</HI> And therefore whatever you might do before, yet when you publish'd your Life, you tho't this Dream to have been from the Spirit of God.—But upon what Evidence? Surely the Bishop's sending for you some Time after, and giving you Money, and the Money's chinking in your Hands, are no satisfactory Proofs of it. For can you be certain, that the Bishop had not told some Body or other what he intended to do? and that this <HI>Dream</HI> was not thereupon excited by <HI>Satan</HI> to ensnare you, and lead you to pay more respect to <HI>Dreams,</HI> than they deserve?—</P>
<P>UPON the whole, the two last of your <HI>Dreams,</HI> it is manifest, you tho't to have been from God, without having any Proof of it. And it is highly probable from several of your Expressions, that you tho't so of the first also.—You <HI>conducted</HI> yourself according to your two first <HI>Dreams;</HI> and if you check'd the Impression which the last made upon you, it could be only because you was not so strongly perswaded of its Divine Original then, as you was afterwards, when you publish'd it to the World. So that we had sufficient Reason to say, as we do, P. 4. <HI>That it is Mr.</HI> Whitefield'<HI>s Manner to conduct himself according to his Dreams:</HI> Not in the <HI>general Course of your</HI> LIFE, as you suppose we mean (for we never imagined you had Dreams enough for your Conduct in that) but when you happen to have a <HI>Dream, which make <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> great Impression,</HI> you have shown yourself very apt to fancy it to be from the Spirit of God, tho' you have no Proof of it, and to conduct yourself ac∣cordingly; and have thereby plainly discovered an <HI>Enthusiastick</HI> Turn of Mind.</P>
<P>AND now, <HI>Sir,</HI> does it make you appear any Thing less <HI>Enthusiastick,</HI> that you have not put one <HI>Dream</HI> in your <HI>Journals,</HI> and another in your <HI>Sermons,</HI> but have told them all in your <HI>Life?</HI> If not, why do you seem to complain as if we had done you some Wrong, because we say, <Q><HI>From
<PB N="12" REF="005715_0011_102693512B8CDD60"/>
these Pieces [namely his Life, Journals and Sermons] it is very evident that he used to govern himself by Dreams?</HI></Q> But if you had been pleased to add, as we said a few Lines before, <Q><HI>Or some unaccountable and ri∣diculous Impulses and Impressions on his Mind,</HI></Q> there would have ap∣peared no Ground for your Complaint. For with <HI>these Things</HI> your <HI>Jour∣nals</HI> and <HI>Sermons</HI> abound as well as your <HI>Life.</HI> And indeed we should have been loath to charge you as an <HI>Enthusiastick Person,</HI> only for your <HI>Dreams,</HI> whatever <HI>Pieces</HI> they might appear in, since you mention no more than three; if you had not given so many other Indications of the same Turn of Mind, by the numerous Instances of <HI>Suggestions, Impulses, Impressions,</HI> &amp;c. which occur so frequently in your Writings, and to which we next proceed.</P>
<P>Now concerning these, we have said, P. 5. <Q>It is plain that he usually governed himself by some sudden Impulses, and Impressions on his Mind.</Q> And we add, that <Q>we have one Instance which may satisfy us, that his first setting out in his Itinerant Business, was (from what? Not a <HI>sudden Impulse:</HI> We don't say so; but) "from an <HI>Enthusiastick Turn of Mind."</HI></Q> And why were we satisfied of this? Why, because you say to your Friends, Journal from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> P. 3. <Q>the sole Motive which induced me to leave my Native Country, <HI>was a full Conviction that it was the Divine Will I should.</HI> What Reasons I can urge for this Perswasion is needless to mention.—What seems a Reason to me, may not be deemed so by another. Let it suffice to inform you, that after earnest Prayer for a Year and an half, that if the Design was not of God, it might come to nought, tho' strong∣ly sollicited to act in a contrary Manner; <HI>I found my self as eagerly bent on going abroad as ever.</HI></Q>—You seem to suspect, that what other Reasons you had to urge, would be deemed of no Weight by your best Friends; and therefore would have them rest satisfied with this, as the most important Thing you had to offer, that you found yourself <HI>eagerly bent</HI> on going abroad, notwithstanding all Sollicitations to the con∣trary, and your own Prayers to God. And is this a good Rule, or is it not rather high <HI>Enthusiasm,</HI> to judge of <HI>the Will of God,</HI> and expect that others should do so too, by the <HI>eagerness</HI> and <HI>obstinacy of our Inclina∣tions?</HI> And the more Time you took to consider of the Step you was about to take, the worse it makes your Case; if after all, your great Reason to think it the Will of God that you should go abroad, was, that you still found yourself as <HI>eagerly bent</HI> upon it as ever.—</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="005715_0012_1026CF5329BBC6E0"/>
IF we have been mistaken in supposing, that you was now setting out upon your <HI>Itinerant Business,</HI> when you was only going to <HI>Georgia,</HI> with an Intention to settle there; we trust you will easily forgive us this Wrong; since, if you was going abroad <HI>under a full <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that it was the Will of God you should do so,</HI> because <HI>you found yourself eagerly bent upon it,</HI> the Charge of <HI>Enthusiasm</HI> for this will be but very little af∣fected by the Place, or the Business for which you was going. Of what Consequence is it, whether you was going abroad to <HI>Itinerate,</HI> or to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> if the Consideration which carried you, and which made you think it <HI>the Will of God,</HI> was this, that you found yourself <HI>eagerly bent upon going,</HI> and that you had been so a long Time? But if it cannot be fairly de∣termined, as you say, P. 6. <Q>whether your first setting out upon the Itinerant Business, was from an <HI>enthusiastical</HI> Turn or not, till you have publish'd an Account how you was induced to set out upon it;</Q> we think it can much lets be determined, on the other Hand, that you had any <HI>Warrant from God,</HI> to act in such an extraordinary Manner, till you have fairly told us what it was. And therefore we think, that you ought not to be encouraged by any in your present Practice; and that you should be willing to cease from it of your self, till you have publish'd <HI>that Tract,</HI> which hath been promised so many Years for our Satisfaction, that you have a Call from God to the Business of Itinerancy.</P>
<P>IT seems to us strange preposterous Management, for any Man to go about from one Province and Colony to another, Year after Year, acting as an extraordinary Officer of Christ, and never shew all the while, what Warrant he hath from the Word of God so to do; but only intimate, that as <Q>he finds Freedom in himself, and Leisure from his Ministerial Employ, hereafter he shall relate how God led him in∣to his present Way of acting,</Q> as you speak in your Life, P. 49. Is not this just such Conduct, as might be expected from any bold Deceiver, who was conscious to himself, that he could give no Account of his pre∣sent Way of acting, which would bear Examination?—Should any Man come from <HI>England</HI> into the <HI>Plantations,</HI> under Pretence of a special Commission from his present Majesty King <HI>George,</HI> whom we heartily pray God long to preserve and prosper; should such a Person go where, and act what he pleased, from Year to Year, under Pretence of Autho∣rity from such Commission, and cry down all, especially <HI>Officers,</HI> who presumed to oppose him, as disloyal to their King; should he frequent∣ly thrust himself into the Business of other Officers, who were known to have held Commissions from the King for 10, 20, or 30 Years, and
<PB N="14" REF="005715_0013_1026CF54CDB02298"/>
to have been faithful in their respective Trusts; and should he put People off from Time to Time, who suspected his Authority, and say, <Q>How can any one determine fairly, whether my setting out to act in this Way was of mine own Head or not, till I have published how I was induced to it? but as I find Freedom in myself, and Leisure from the King's Business, hereafter, God willing, I shall produce my Commission;</Q> could any Body be simple enough not to see thro' such Management? Or would any loyal Subject of the King dare to encourage or support such a Man, in such a Course of Behaviour, for five or six Years together?</P>
<P>YOU go on and ask us, P. 6th. <Q>If I say I went to Bed with <HI>unusual Tho'ts</HI> and <HI>Convictions,</HI> how is this an Instance of my attributing <HI>any com∣mon Turn of my Mind to a Motion of the holy Spirit?</HI></Q> We Answer, be∣cause what you call <HI>unusual</HI> Tho'ts and Convictions, are nothing but such Turns of Mind, and Workings of Fancy, as are <HI>common in enthusiastical</HI> Persons. And the same Answer may serve well enough for what you say to the next Instance.</P>
<P>BUT you observe concerning this, that <Q>we draw an Inference from it, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> So that <HI>every Scripture</HI> which came to his View, was received as the <HI>Bath Kol</HI> of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and he plainly shews himself as much directed by this Way of finding out the Will of God, as he calls it, as the <HI>old Heathens</HI> were by their <HI>Sortes Homericae, Virgilianae,</HI> &amp;c.</Q>—Upon which you demand, <Q>How doth this prove, that <HI>every Scripture</HI> which came to my View was received as the <HI>Bath Kol,</HI> &amp;c? I think I mentioned only the first of <HI>Jonah</HI> and the 27th of <HI>Acts.</HI></Q>—Here you don't deny, that you <HI>received these two Portions</HI> of Scripture as the <HI>Bath Kol</HI> of the <HI>Jews;</HI> but only intimate, that two Instances are not enough to prove, that you received <HI>every Scripture</HI> so, which came to your View.—Could you imagine, <HI>Sir,</HI> that we intended the Word <HI>every</HI> in a strict absolute Sense, any more than our blessed Lord did, when he said, Preach the Gospel to <HI>every Creature?</HI> All that we meant was only, that it was your frequent Practice to receive such Scriptures, as came to your View, after this Manner: And this was all that the Argument before us required. You, by your Silence, allow it to be true of the two first Instances given; and we immediately subjoined a third, and tho't three Instances sufficient for a Specimen of your Custom in this Matter.—If we had mentioned all the Examples of this Sort, which occur in your Writings, we must have transcribed a considerable Part of some of your Journals.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="005715_0014_1026CF56535BB428"/>
BUT you seem to think our third Instance not pertinent to our Pur∣pose. The Instance, as it stands in your Journal from <HI>Savannah</HI> to <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> P. 38. is this, <Q>The Doctor of our Ship took up the <HI>Common Prayer Book,</HI> and observed, that he opened upon these Words, <HI>Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for he hath visited and redeemed his People.</HI> And indeed (say you) he has, for about 8 o'Clock our Men saw Land.</Q> You take special Notice of the Doctor's observing, <HI>that he opened upon these Words;</HI> and upon it you make the Application above-mentioned. Here again you don't deny, that you tho't yourself <HI>directed by this Scripture</HI> in finding out the Will or Purpose of God, as the <HI>old Heathens</HI> were by their <HI>Sortes Homerics</HI> and <HI>Virgilians,</HI> which was what we alledged this Passage to prove: But you only ask, <Q>How is this a full Instance, when these Words did not appear to <HI>my View</HI> at all, but the <HI>Doctor's?</HI></Q>—But of what Consequence is it, whether this Scripture was bro't to your Mind by seeing it your self, or by hearing another read it? Your Application of it, is what proves your <HI>Enthusiastick</HI> Turn. You might very piously say upon Sight of Land, <HI>The Lord hath visited and redeemed his People,</HI> tho' not in the Sense in which these Words are used by <HI>Zacharias,</HI> Luke 1. 68. But if you took the appearing of these Words to the Doctor, at his <HI>first opening the Book,</HI> to be a <HI>previous No∣tice from God</HI> of your approaching Deliverance; then you used the Scriptures in this Case, just as the <HI>old Heathens</HI> frequently did <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil.</HI></P>
<P>YOU tell us upon another Occasion, P. 12. <Q>that you don't think that holy venerable Man of God, Dr. <HI>Increase Mather,</HI> would have blamed you.</Q> But we are perswaded he would have blamed you for this. In a <HI>Discourse concerning Angelical Apparitions,</HI> the Dr. says, P. 29. Concerning one <HI>Drabicius,</HI> a Protestant <HI>Moravian</HI> Minister, <Q>I could not but take Notice of one Vanity in him, which I am unwil∣ling to pass by without a Remark, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that he would snatch up the Bible, resolving that the first Place which he lighted on, should be the Answer to his Doubt. Thus to make a <HI>Fortune Book</HI> of the bles∣sed Bible, is a very unwarrantable Custom, however practised by many. It is indeed a <HI>Paganish</HI> Custom, the <HI>Heathen</HI> did, in that Way, use Divinations. When <HI>Septimius Severus</HI> was in Doubt concerning his obtaining the Empire, he would know his Fortune by trying what Verse in <HI>Virgil</HI> he should first light upon, which happened to be that AEneid. 6. <HI>Tu regere Imperio Populos, Romane Memento:</HI>—Such Per∣sons imitate that Sort of <HI>Witchcraft,</HI> which of old was known by the
<PB N="16" REF="005715_0015_1026CF57E8532E60"/>
Name of <HI>Sortilegium,</HI> more than becomes Christians to do.</Q> This was the Judgment of that holy venerable Man of God, Dr. <HI>Increase Mather</HI> (under whose Wing you sometimes seem desirous to shelter your sell) concerning such Practices.</P>
<P>YOU proceed, P. 7. and say, <Q>That we lay something more to your Charge, namely, that you sometimes speak as if you had Com∣munications directly from the Spirit of God.</Q> Upon which you ask, whether <Q>it is a Crime for a Believer, much more a Minister of Jesus, to speak of his having Communications directly from the Spirit of God?</Q>—We Answer, by no Means, if you intend Communications of <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Comfort.</HI> And this appears to be your Meaning, by your following Interrogatories; <Q>How are Believers sealed? How is the Divine Life begun?</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But if you had duly observed the Instances mentioned by us, you would easily have seen, that they were <HI>Communications of a very different sort</HI> which we blamed you for seeming to arrogate to yourself. And so you might have spared your Questions, which tend only to amuse and mislead your Readers.—The Instances we cited were such as these, Journal from <HI>Savannah</HI> to <HI>N. E.</HI> P. 68. <HI>The Spirit of the Lord was upon me.</HI> Journal from <HI>N. E.</HI> to <HI>Falmouth,</HI> P. 6. <HI>The Spirit of the Lord gave me Freedom, till at length it came down like a mighty <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</HI> And many other like Instances might be mentioned; as when you tell us, that you was filled with <HI>the Holy Ghost;</HI> That <HI>the Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you with Power from in high;</HI> That <HI>the Holy Spirit gave you Utterance,</HI> and that others <HI>received the Holy Ghost</HI> immediately upon hearing you preach Christ.—Now, <HI>Sir,</HI> you doubtless know very well, that all these Ex∣pressions are used in the Scriptures to signify (principally, at least, if not only) the <HI>Communication of miraculous Gifts</HI> from the Spirit of God. And therefore we cannot out think it a very dangerous abuse of Scripture Language, for you to speak so frequently, in such a Style, of the Communications from the Spirit of God to you. It looks too much as if you did it on Purpose, to lead weak People to think more high∣ly of you, than they ought to think; to lead them to imagine, that you <HI>are <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from on high</HI> with those miraculous Gifts, which these Expressions always denote, when they are used in the Scriptures. And we think you the more to blame in this, because it is what you have been told of long ago, and yet have made no Alteration in your Man∣ner of Writting; but in the last of your <HI>Journals,</HI> which we have seen, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to apply to yourself, the strongest Expressions which the
<PB N="17" REF="005715_0016_1026CF5AED96AF50"/>
<HI>New-Testament</HI> any where uses, to signify the Communication of <HI>miracu∣lous Gifts</HI> to the <HI>Apostles,</HI> or others. And you tell us, in such Language, of Communications from the Spirit of God to <HI>you,</HI> much oftner than we read of them in the <HI>New Testament</HI> concerning any, or all the <HI>Apostles</HI> of our Lord.—We should be glad, <HI>Sir,</HI> if you would help us to account for this Part of your Conduct, without supposing either <HI>firing Delusion,</HI> or a very ostentatious Temper, or a very ill Design to lie at the Bot∣tom of it.</P>
<P>AGAIN, you observe (P. ibid) that we <Q>bring a fresh Accusation against you; that sometimes, and indeed very frequently, you (in a most Enthusiastick Manner) apply, even the <HI>Historical</HI> Parts of Scrip∣ture to yourself, and your own Affairs.</Q>—The Instances we men∣tioned were, that which occurs in your Journal from <HI>Savannah</HI> to <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> P. 28. <Q>when you was consulting God by Prayer, whether it was his Will that you should go to <HI>England,</HI> those Words were re∣markably pressed upon you, that <HI>when Jesus was returned, the Peo∣ple gladly received him, for they were all waiting for him.</HI></Q> This you took (as appears by the Reflection you made upon it) to be a Direction to you from God to go to <HI>England.</HI> And again, that P. 42. where you make your being brought safe to <HI>Carrig<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olt Island</HI> to be a <HI>Fulfilment</HI> of those Words of the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> to the Mariners, <HI>Acts</HI> 27. 26. <HI>How∣beit we must be cast upon a certain Island.</HI> It was such an Application as this of the Historical Parts of Scripture to yourself and your own Affairs, concerning which we supposed you <Q>appeal to the Experience of every spiritual Reader of holy Writ, whether or no if he consulted the Word of God in this Manner, he was not, at all Times, and at all Seasons, as plainly directed how to act as tho' he had consulted the <HI>Urim and Thummim</HI> which was upon the <HI>high Priest's</HI>'s Breast.</Q> Sermon (of <HI>searching the Scripture</HI>) P. 246.—Now you don't tell us that we have Mistaken you; and that it was some other sort of Application of the Historical Parts of Scripture, which you intend; but you endeavour to justify such Applications as these by alledging, "that all Scripture (in∣cluding the Historical as well as Doctrinal and Preceptive Parts) <HI>is given by Inspiration of God, and is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof. &amp;c."</HI> And that the Historical Parts of Scripture <HI>were written for our Admonition, upon whom the Ends of the World are come.</HI> But pray, <HI>Sir,</HI> how do these Texts, or any which you further offer, prove, that because <HI>when Jesus was returned, the People gladly received him,</HI> therefore it was <HI>your Duty</HI> to leave your Flock at <HI>Savannah,</HI> and return to <HI>England?</HI> or
<PB N="18" REF="005715_0017_1026CF5D714EB9F8"/>
how do they prove that your being bro't into a <HI>safe Harbour,</HI> was a <HI>Fulfilment</HI> of the Prediction and History of the Apostle <HI>Paul's Ship∣wreck?</HI> May not these Passages of Scripture be profitable? May not some Lessons of Piety or Wisdom be learned from them? And yet the Applications you have made of them to yourself, and your own Affairs, have no Foundation but in an heated Fancy?</P>
<P>IF you say, that you was led into <HI>such Applications</HI> of the <HI>Historical Parts</HI> of Scripture, by their being strongly <HI>pressed</HI> upon your Mind; we then heartily recommend to your Consideration, the prudent Advice of the venerable Dr. <HI>Colman,</HI> in his Letter to Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> upon reading the <HI>Confession</HI> and <HI>Retractations</HI> of Mr. <HI>Davenport,</HI> <Q>P. 5. Let such, says he, as may be <HI>listning</HI> too much to <HI>Impulses</HI> from particular <HI>Texts of Scripture, suggested</HI> to them with <HI>Glosses</HI> quite foreign to the direct, plain, and true Sense of the Place; let such take Warning from Mr. <HI>Davenport,</HI> and learn from his sad Experience and sorrow∣ful <HI>Testimony,</HI> to apprehend themselves in great <HI>Danger</HI> of being led <HI>astray,</HI> by hearkening to <HI>Impulses</HI> or <HI>Impressions as a Rule of Conduct,</HI> whether they come <HI>with</HI> or without a <HI>Text of Scripture.</HI></Q></P>
<P>WE shall only add upon this Head, that when you <Q>appeal to the Experience of every spiritual Reader of holy Writ, whether or no, if he consulted the Word of God in this Manner, he was not at all Times and at all Seasons as plainly directed how to act, as tho' he had con∣sulted the <HI>Urim</HI> and <HI>Thummim</HI> which was upon the High Priest's Breast;</Q> and when in a following Paragraph of the same Page, <Q>you extend this <HI>plain Direction</HI> to all Circumstances and Places, tho' never so minute, never so particular:</Q> We apprehend these to be Stretches, beyond what might reasonably have been expected from any Protestant Minister, or sober Christian.—You know, <HI>Sir,</HI> that the Answer of God by <HI>Urim</HI> and <HI>Thummim,</HI> was not <HI>uncertain</HI> and <HI>ambiguous,</HI> like the Hea∣then Oracles, but <HI>clear</HI> and <HI>determinate,</HI> so that none could mistake or differ about the Meaning of it; whereas the Directions which you have fetch'd from the <HI>Historical</HI> Parts of Scripture, are such, as <HI>none beside yourself can see to be contained in them.</HI>—Again, the Answer by <HI>Urim</HI> and <HI>Thummim</HI> was concerning <HI>important</HI> and not <HI>minute</HI> Matters; and it was <HI>infallible;</HI> whereas you cannot but see from the very different Sentiments of sincere Christians, in many <HI>lesser Points</HI> both of Doctrine and Practice, wherein you have no Reason to doubt but they have consulted the Word of God in the best Manner they can, that after all, they are not <HI>infallibly</HI> directed, as the <HI>Israelites</HI> were, when they consulted the <HI>Urim</HI> and <HI>Thum∣mim</HI> about <HI>important</HI> Affairs.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="005715_0018_1026CF610CAFECC0"/>
IN fine, to pretend that <HI>every spiritual Reader of holy Writ,</HI> if he con∣sults the Word of God right, shall be directed in <HI>all Circumstances,</HI> tho' ever so <HI>minute</HI> or particular, as the <HI>Israelites</HI> were by <HI>Urim</HI> and <HI>Thummim,</HI> is to ascribe to <HI>every spiritual Reader,</HI> who is not wanting to himself in consulting the Word of God, such an <HI>infallible Direction as the Church of Rome</HI> it self never claimed.—For the <HI>Infallibility</HI> which the <HI>Romanists</HI> arrogate to <HI>their Church,</HI> is no more than this, that thro' the Assistance of Christ and his Holy Spirit, it <HI>cannot err,</HI> in any <HI>Doctrine of Religion;</HI> in other Matters, especially <HI>minute</HI> ones, they readily allow it may: Whereas you will not allow the <HI>spiritual Reader of holy Writ</HI> to be left to <HI>err,</HI> so much as in a <HI>Circumstance,</HI> tho' ever so <HI>minute,</HI> ever so <HI>par∣ticular;</HI> but affirm, that if he consults the Word of God in the Manner you prescribe, he shall be <HI>at all Times as plainly directed,</HI> as tho' he had consulted the <HI>Urim</HI> and <HI>Thummim</HI> at the <HI>High Priest's</HI> Breast.—If there were not many other Evidences of it, we think that this alone would be a full Proof, that you, <HI>Sir,</HI> are not at <HI>all Times so directed,</HI> even in the <HI>Doctrines</HI> which you preach, print, and <HI>take a little Time to revise</HI> and correct for a new Edition. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid, Pref. to Edition in 1741.</NOTE></P>
<P>YOU go on, P. 3. to mention our blaming you for saying, <Q>that to talk of any having the Spirit of God without feeling it, is in reality to deny the Thing it self.</Q>—The <ABBR>Rev.</ABBR> President, we suppose, will take a proper Notice of what you offer upon this Occasion, in his fol∣lowing Letter to you: And therefore we shall only observe as briefly as may be,</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT you lay great Stress upon an Expression, which the Scriptures rather discourage, than countenance the use of.—When our blessed Lord says, <HI>Luke</HI> 24. 39. <HI>Handle me, for a Spirit hath not Flesh and Bones,</HI> don't be intimate, <HI>that a Spirit is not to be felt?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. YOU yourself own the Expression of <HI>feeling</HI> of <HI>the Spirit,</HI> to be Metaphorical, and not Proper.—Why then may not another believe all the Truth which you do about the <HI>indwelling of the Spirit,</HI> and the Believer's <HI>perception of it,</HI> and yet not like to express his Sentiments by so gross a Metaphor as <HI>feeling?</HI> Why should it be tho't as incredible as the Doctrine of <HI>Transubstantiation,</HI> for a Man to have the Spirit of God dwelling in him, and to be satisfied he <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> too, and yet chuse to express his Perception of it, by a <HI>proper,</HI> rather than a <HI>Metaphorical</HI> improper Word? Especially, when the very frequent use of that <HI>Meta∣phorical</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="005715_0019_1026CF62D29896F0"/>
Word, and the laying great Stress upon it, hath led many weak People into gross Apprehensions of the Spirit of God, and its Operations; as if their perceiving a great Commotion of their own animal Spirits, was a <HI>feeling</HI> of the Spirit of God. Is it not high Time to lay aside the ordinary Use of an <HI>improper</HI> Word, when the frequent Use of it is found by sad Experience to be attended with such unhappy Effects, as we suppose the President will show you in his following Letter? Will you dare to say, that every Man is destitute of the Spirit of God, who don't <HI>feel</HI> it, just as we <HI>feel</HI> the <HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>Wine</HI> in the Lord's Supper? If not, why can you no more part with the Metaphorical Word <HI>fuel</HI> than you can believe the Doctrine of <HI>Transubstantiation?</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. IF when you say, that <HI>to talk of having the Spirit of God, without feeling it, is in reality to deny the Thing it self,</HI> you intend, that no Man can have the Spirit of God, unless at the same Time he perceives it as fully and certainly, as he does any Material Substance, when he handles and feels it; if this be what you intend, (as appears highly probable from your contending so earnestly for this <HI>strong,</HI> however <HI>improper</HI> Ex∣pression) then we say, you mean by it, to advance a Doctrine contradic∣tory to the unerring Oracles of God.—For doubtless the Man who <HI>feareth the Lord, and obeyeth the Voice of his Servant,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 50 10</NOTE> hath the Spirit of God dwelling in him: And yet such a Man may <HI>walk in Darkness and have no Light,</HI> and therefore not be as certain that he hath the Spirit of God, as he is that he feels a Piece of Matter when he hath it in his Hand.</P>
<P>BUT you tell us, P. 9. that <Q>such a Way of speaking and writing is very common amongst the most eminent Divines, as well as the Articles of the Church of <HI>England.</HI></Q> We shall not <HI>minutely criticise</HI> upon your <HI>Diction</HI> here, or upon the <HI>Grammatical Construction</HI> of some other Passages; but only observe, that you have not proved the Truth of what you affirm, by the instances you have alledged. The <HI>single</HI> Instance you produce from the Articles of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> to prove the <HI>frequency</HI> of this Way of writing in those Articles, speaks of such as feel in themselves the <HI>Working</HI> of the Spirit of Christ; Mr. <HI>Guthrie</HI> speaks of feeling the <HI>Love of God shed abroad in the Heart;</HI> and Mr. <HI>Baxter,</HI> of feeling the <HI>Evil of Sin,</HI> and the <HI>Worth of Holiness.</HI> But none of them speak of feeling <HI>the Spirit of God</HI> it self; as if <HI>that</HI> was a proper Object of <HI>the Sense of Feeling.</HI> And much less do they say,
<PB N="21" REF="005715_0020_1026CF64D915E3E8"/>
<Q>That for a Believer to be satisfied that he hath the Spirit of God dwel∣ling in him, and yet not feel it, is as incomprehensible, as the Doc∣trine of Transubstantiation.</Q>—If any should think the Expression with which your Quotation from Mr. <HI>Guthrie</HI> concludes, is too near akin to your own Way of speaking; we only say, it is so very gross, that we hope he never used it <HI>more than once</HI> We have not observed the Writings of that pious Man to be <HI>full of such Expressions.</HI> And if <Q>your Compositions are full of them</Q> (as you tell us, P. 10) we should hope that by this Time you would be sensible, that you have little Reason to glory in them; were it not that your Mind must be fast shut up, and barred against Conviction, that you have been mistaken, or done amiss, so long as you vainly imagine, <Q>that if you do but make an Appli∣cation of every Thing you read in Scripture to your own Heart, you are at all Times and in all Circumstances, tho' ever so minute or par∣ticular, as plainly directed, as tho' you had consulted the <HI>Urim</HI> and <HI>Thummim.</HI></Q></P>
<P>AND your maintaining this Principle only, which you affirm in the strongest Terms, is, we think, enough to enable you to determine very easily, what you say, P. 11. you <Q>cannot determine; namely, what Tendency your Writings have to make People think, that you have as familiar a Converse and Communion with God, as any of the Pro∣phets and Apostles, and such as we all acknowledge to have been un∣der the Inspiration of the holy Ghost.</Q> For besure none of them ever pretended <Q>to be directed how to act, at all Times and in all Circumstances, more plainly, than if they had consulted the <HI>Urim</HI> and <HI>Thummim</HI> which was upon the <HI>High Priest's</HI> Breast.</Q>—It can therefore only serve to amuse your Readers, when you affirm, P. <HI>ibid.</HI> <Q>that you would not have undertaken to preach the Gospel for ten thousand Worlds, had you not been fully perswaded that you had a Degree of that Spirit, and was admitted to a Degree of that holy and familiar Converse and Communion with God, which the Prophets and Apostles were favoured with, <HI>in common with all Believers.</HI></Q> For you know very well, <HI>Sir,</HI> that we blame you not, for pretending to <HI>that Converse and Communion with God</HI> which is <HI>common to all Believers;</HI> but for lead∣ing your Readers to think, that you are favoured with <HI>such Converse and Communion</HI> as was <HI>peculiar to the Prophets and Apostles,</HI> as they were inspired Persons. And what Tendency your Writings have to do this, we have very fully manifested above, P. 18. 19.</P>

AND now, having shown the Insufficiency of your Defence of your∣self against the Charge of <HI>Enthusiasm,</HI> we hope, in every Instance which hath been mentioned; we proceed next to consider what you say in An∣swer to our Charge against you, as <HI>an uncharitable, censorious and slande∣rous Man.</HI>—And here we readily allow, that you understood us right, when, P. 11. you suppose we meant <HI>habitually</HI> such; for at that Time we had no Reason to think you otherwise. "Might not <HI>Peter</HI> have been properly stiled a cursing <HI>swearing</HI> Man, and <HI>David</HI> a murde∣ring adulterous Man," if <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>David</HI> had frequently repeated those Sins, and done so deliberately, and never expressed any Repentance or Sorrow for them? And this, <HI>Sir,</HI> with Concern and Grief we apprehend to have been exactly your Case. We think you have entertained groundless Surmises of others, and that you have been guilty of the cry∣ing Sin of treating the Name of others very injuriously, and that you have done thus deliberately and often, in the most publick Manner you could, and with other Circumstances of Aggravation; and we don't know that you had ever publickly manifested any Sense of your Sin, or Con∣cern about it, in any Instance of this Sort, before our Testimony came abroad. How far, what you have done since, may deserve the Name of Christian Satisfaction, we shall consider as the Instances occur. We may add, that you have thus injuriously, treated, not <HI>particular Persons</HI> only, but large <HI>Bodies</HI> of Men of publick Character, and whose Usefulness in the World, in a great Measure, depends upon their good Name. These Things, <HI>Sir,</HI> are notorious, you have been often told of them, and have had a great deal of Time to reflect upon them, and yet after all, to our Sorrow, we see you insinuating. P. 11. as if you "might only have been <HI>somewhat</HI> rash or uncharitable in your Judgment past upon some <HI>particular Persons</HI> or Things." You go on to ask, <Q>How we prove this Charge, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that you are an uncharitable (you should have added, <HI>censorious</HI> and) slanderous Man?</Q>—For the Proof of this, we had instanced first, in <Q>your monstrous Reflections upon the great and good Arch-Bishop <HI>Tillotson</HI> (as Dr. <HI>Increase Mather</HI> stiles him) comparing his Sermons to the conjuring Books,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI>—But <Q>this you apprehend does not prove, that you cast monstrous Reflections upon Arch-Bishop <HI>Tillotson,</HI> as to his <HI>personal Character.</HI></Q>—Pray, <HI>Sir,</HI> would you not think it a monstrous Reflection upon the <ABBR>Rev.</ABBR> Mr. <HI>White∣field,</HI> if we should compare his Sermons to conjuring Books? And would it not affect his <HI>personal Character</HI> too? For what Apprehensions must the World have of the <HI>Man,</HI> if it was once made to believe, that his
<PB N="23" REF="005715_0022_1026CF6CA67C0918"/>
very <HI>Sermons</HI> are as pernicious, as <HI>Books</HI> which teach <HI>familiar Converse and Communion with the Devil?</HI>—And is it not true, <HI>Sir,</HI> <Q>that you have poken of the <HI>Person</HI> of the Arch Bishop in too strong Terms, and too rashly condemned his <HI>State,</HI> when you ought only to have censured his <HI>Doctrine?</HI></Q> Have you not freely confessed these Things in your Letter to Dr. <HI>Chauncy,</HI> before you wrote this Letter to us? and have you not also professed "your Sorrow, that you have <HI>judged</HI> the Arch-Bishop's <HI>State</HI> and <HI>Person,</HI> and not spoken sufficiently in Commen∣dation of his great Candour and Moderation?" If these are your own Words, and proceed from your Heart, why so loth <HI>now</HI> to let the World know, "that you have cast Reflections, which we call monstrous," and that very justly, "upon Arch-Bishop <HI>Tillotson,</HI> as to his <HI>personal Cha∣racter?"</HI> Do you desire, that such as have not seen your Confession to the <ABBR>Rev.</ABBR> Dr. <HI>Chauncy,</HI> should believe, that you don't think yourself to blame in this Mattter? Or do you now really repent of your Repen∣tance; and design by this Passage, implicitly to retract your Retracta∣tions, and insinuate to the World, that what you have said of the Arch-Bishop, as to his <HI>personal Character, is Truth,</HI> and not Reflection? That you again think his <HI>State</HI> and <HI>Person</HI> as bad as you have ever re∣presented them?</P>
<P>YOU proceed and tell us, <Q>that Dr. <HI>Increase Mather</HI> himself, as you have been informed by the <ABBR>Rev.</ABBR> Mr. <HI>Gee,</HI> constantly warned the Students against the Arch Bishop's Books,</Q>—We are perswaded here is some Mistake in this Matter; either that the <ABBR>Rev.</ABBR> Mr. <HI>Gee</HI> expressed himself unwarily, or that you misunderstood, and so have misrepresented what he told you. Indeed we can easily believe, that the Dr. frequent∣ly warned the Students against <HI>some Things</HI> in the Arch-Bishop's Books: And some of us have done so too, as freely and publickly as ever Dr. <HI>Mather</HI> did. But we have Reason to think, that the <HI>Dr.</HI> did not <HI>con∣stantly warn the Students</HI> against the Arch-Bishop's <HI>Books in general,</HI> as if there was nothing in them worth their reading, nothing but what was dangerous and to be condemned. For we have been credibly informed, that the <HI>Dr.</HI> hath sometimes inserted the Arch-Bishop's Books in Cata∣logues he hath given to the Students; no doubt at the same Time giving proper Warning of what he tho't erroneous in them; or putting other Books into the Catalogues, which would be sufficient Preservatives against the Arch-Bishop's Errors. Nor is Dr. <HI>Mather</HI> to be charged with Inconsistency for this, any more than you, <HI>Sir,</HI> who have <HI>greatly
<PB N="24" REF="005715_0023_1026CF6E668BDBE0"/>
blamed</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>N. E.</HI> Jour. P. 86.</NOTE> the <ABBR>Rev.</ABBR> Mr. <HI>Stoddard,</HI> <Q>for his endeavouring to prove, that unconverted Men may be admitted into the Ministry.</Q> And yet you call him a <HI>great and good Man,</HI> and highly esteem, and strongly recommend his Books; notwithstanding that if unconverted Ministers are so dangerous to the Church of Christ, as you have represented them, this Error of Mr. <HI>Stoddard</HI>'s must be (in your Account) one of the most fatal and extensively pernicious, that a Divine could fall into.</P>
<P>YOU observe next. <Q>that Dr. <HI>Increase Mather,</HI> if we may credit the Writer of his Life, dealt as much in Impressions and inward Feelings, as the Person against whom we have published our Testimony.</Q>—To this we need only say at present, that whenever you shall think fit to produce the Reasons, upon which you ground this Apprehension of the Dr. we shall shew you the Difference between him and you; or readily own we cannot. But we think it a great Injury to him, when you insinuate in your next Words, as if the Dr. was so artful and insin∣cere, as to call the Arch Bishop a <HI>Good Man,</HI> only for his <HI>great Generosity and Moderation towards the Dissenters.</HI> Some of us have heard the Dr. say, that he believed the Arch-Bishop was now <HI>in Heaven.</HI> Surely he did not think, that only <HI>Generesity</HI> and <HI>Moderation</HI> carried him thither.</P>
<P>YOU go on and tell us, that <Q>you don't think Dr. <HI>Mather</HI> would blame you for what you have said concerning Mr. <HI>G.</HI> and Mr. <HI>H.</HI></Q>—That is, in other Words, you don't think you ought to be blamed for your Treatment of these two Ministers of the Gospel. You don't think you have injured them, or violated any Law of God, in speaking as you have concerning them.—We are truly sorry, <HI>Sir,</HI> to see you still in this Temper: You cannot but be sensible, that we don't blame you, for telling these two Gentlemen in <HI>private,</HI> what you tho't of them. And whether you did well or ill, to allow your self in the Tho'ts you enter∣tained concerning them, we willingly leave to the great Searcher of Hearts of determine. You might be very criminally defective in the Exercise of that Charity, which <HI>thinketh no Evil, believeth all Things,</HI> and <HI>hopeth all Things,</HI> when you suffered your self to think these Gentlemen unconverted. But whether you was right or wrong in your Tho'ts, you might do well to tell them with a becoming Modesty, Tenderness, and Concern, to the Gentlemen themselves, <HI>between them and you.</HI> This could do them no Harm, and might possibly be a Means of Good to them.—But did you act the Part of a Christian, when you entered
<PB N="25" REF="005715_0024_1026CF70615DE690"/> 
your hard Tho'ts of these two Gentlemen in your <HI>Journal,</HI> and made them publick to the World? Was this a likely Way to do any Good to the Men themselves? or was it not rather the Way to irritate their Passions, and so prevent the Good they might otherwise have gotten, by your private Dealing with them? And was it not the most direct Course you could have taken, to prejudice the Minds of many under their Pastoral Care against them, and so prevent their getting any Good by their Ministrations? So that in this, you have not only done, what in you lay to deprive these two Ministers of Christ of a <HI>good Name,</HI> which is <HI>rather to be chosen than great Riches;</HI> but have also done what had a natural Tendency to hurt, both the Souls of these Ministers themselves, and also the Souls of the People committed to their Care. And there∣fore we think, that in these two Instances you have heinously violated the holy Laws of God; and that the Guilt of doing so still lies upon you; since you rather justify than condemn yourself for it.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, it deserves to be remarked, that you entered the Inti∣mation in your <HI>Journal</HI> concerning Mr. <HI>H—n,</HI> that he had <HI>no Experi∣mental Knowledge of the New Birth,</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>N. E.</HI> Journ. P. 44.</NOTE> just after you had been <HI>in close Talk</HI> with him, and he had been (as you acknowledge) <HI>very civil,</HI> and <HI>would have had you staid with him longer.</HI>—How dangerous a Thing must it be for a <HI>Minister</HI> to converse freely with you in private, when the most <HI>civil Treatment,</HI> if you happen (right or wrong) to think him unconverted, won't hinder you from taking the first Opportunity you can, to tell the World in Print, that you look upon him to be one of those Men, whom you have represented as the <HI>Bane of the Christian Church,</HI> and as <HI>unlikely as the Devil to be made use of by God in conver∣ting Sinners!</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>N. E.</HI> Journ. P. 86. P. 70.</NOTE></P>
<P>IN fine, it appears to us no small Aggravation of your Fault, that you strike at the Name and Usefulness of this Gentleman, under a Shew of <HI>praying to God</HI> for him.—Had you put up your Prayer for him in your <HI>Closet,</HI> you might have acted like a Christian; provided you had good Reason to fear his <HI>State</HI> to be so bad. But to put your Prayer for him into <HI>Print,</HI> what was it but to <HI>defame</HI> him, in the most publick and injurious Manner, under a Shew of <HI>Pity to him,</HI> and <HI>Devoti∣on towards God?</HI> How like is this to the <HI>Pharisee,</HI> who under Pretence of <HI>giving Thanks to God,</HI> was not afraid to <HI>rob God of his Prerogative, and unjustly judge his Neighbour,</HI> as you tell us elsewhere. <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">See Sermon of the Pharisee and Publican, P 162, 163.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="005715_0025_1026CF73731F2C68"/>
BUT what Wonder is it, to see you treating the Name and Character of <HI>particular Persons</HI> in this injurious Manner, when you have not been afraid or ashamed to deal thus with <HI>whole Societies, and large Bodies of Men,</HI> whose Usefulness is of great Importance to the Church of Christ, and yet depends very much upon their good Name and Character in the World: And when you have ventured to do thus, without any per∣sonal Knowledge of them, only upon the Information of some, with whom you could have had but a very short Acquaintance, and so could not make any safe Judgment, whether they were credible Persons or not.</P>
<P>AND this brings us to your <Q>reproachful Reflections upon the Society which is immediately under our Care.</Q> The Reflections are these, as you rehearse them, P 12. <Q>As far as I could gather from some who well knew the State of it [the <HI>College</HI>] not far superiour to <HI>our Universities,</HI> in Piety and true Godliness.—Tutors neglect to pray with and examine the Heart of their Pupils.—Discipline is at too low an Ebb:—Bad Books are become fashionable among them.—<HI>Tillotson</HI> and <HI>Clark</HI> are read, instead of <HI>Shepherd, Stoddard,</HI> and such like evangelical Writers.</Q> For publishing this disadvantageous Character of us, only upon Hear say, and that too probably from Persons whom you had not had six Days Acquaintance with <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>N. B.</HI> Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> arrived at <HI>Boston</HI> Thursday <HI>Sept.</HI> 18 about 8 in the Evening, and the next Wednesday he entred this Passage in his Journal. See <HI>N. E.</HI> Journal, Page 46, 55.</NOTE>, we have charged you with Rashness, and Contradiction to our Saviour's Rule; and you are sensible that the President undertook, from his own Examination of Things, a few Months after, to contradict some Part of your evil Report concerning us, in the Face of a venerable and great Assembly, many of them well acquainted with the State of the College.—These Things you make no Reply to; nor do you attempt to prove the Truth of the Reproaches you have taken up against us, and spread as far as your Journals find a Reading: But gravely ask us, "Were not these Things so at the Time in which I wrote them?" And taking it for granted that they were, you go on and say, <Q>Wherein then in writing thus, have I slandered <HI>Harvard College?</HI></Q> And you assure us, that you would <Q>be glad to find, that the <ABBR>Rev.</ABBR> President was not mistaken in what he declared before the Convention, from his own Examination.</Q> We will not say here, what perhaps some would, that this is a lively Specimen of the prevailing of too much of <HI>that Temper</HI> in you still, which you tell us in your Life, P. 2. that you <HI>soon gave pregnant Proofs
<PB N="27" REF="005715_0026_1026CF781CBECB90"/>
of</HI> Instead of this, we only ask, how you expect to find (what you say you should be glad of) "That the President was not mistaken?" It seems neither <HI>his</HI> Word, not <HI>ours,</HI> is of any Weight with you; but you still believe that "Things were at the Time in which you wrote," as you have represented them. And therefore, tho' you say, <Q>you are sorry that you published your <HI>private</HI> Informations concerning the Colleges to the World;</Q> yet you still declare the <HI>Reasons to be credi∣ble from</HI> whom you had them; and are yet of Opinion, that <HI>in writing <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you have not slandered Harvard College.</HI> We little expect therefore to convince <HI>you;</HI> but we believe we shall do a Pleasure to many <HI>others,</HI> (whose Opinion of us we ought to value) if we proceed to consider the several Articles of your Representation of us.</P>
<P>AND here you say, first, that <Q>as far as you could gather from some, who knew the State of the College well, it is not far superiour to <HI>our Universities</HI> in Piety and true Godliness.</Q>—To know what you mean by this, we must look to the Character you give of the <HI>Universities</HI> in <HI>England.</HI> Now this we have in your Journal at <HI>Williamsburgh,</HI> P. 109. where speaking of the College at that Place, you say, <Q>It may be of excellent Use, if learning <HI>Christ</HI> be made the Foundation of their Study, and other Arts and Sciences only intro∣duced and pursued as subservient to that. For want of this, most of our <HI>English</HI> Schools and <HI>Universities</HI> are sunk into <HI>meer Seminaries of Paganism. Christ or Christianity</HI> is scarce so much as named among them.</Q>—As for this your Character of the <HI>Universities</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> we only say, that you have taught us to <HI>believe you with Discretion,</HI> by telling the World, that <HI>our State,</HI> with Respect to <Q>Piety and true Godliness, is not far superiour to this.</Q>—Concerning our own <HI>Academy,</HI> we say, we are far from boasting of its <HI>Piety and true Godliness.</HI> We are heartily sorry, that there is not much more of these to be found among the Youth under our Care, than there is. And yet we may with great Truth, and without any Immodesty, affirm, that the <HI>Knowledge of the only true God, and of Jesus Christ whom He hath sent,</HI> is earnestly recommended to the Students as that, in Comparison whereof they ought to account all other Things but <HI>Loss and Dung.</HI> And we must farther tell you, that we cannot easily perswade ourselves, that any <HI>credible Per∣son,</HI> who <HI>well knew the State</HI> of our Society, ever told you any Thing, from which he will own you could fairly gather, that it was "not far superiour for Piety and true Godliness, to such Universities as are sunk into <HI>meer Seminaries of Paganism; where Christ, or Christianity is scarce
<PB N="28" REF="005715_0027_1026CF79FAB9FB38"/>
so much as named."</HI> Produce the <HI>credible Person</HI> who gave you this In∣formation, or take the vile Slander upon yourself, and let Confusion cover you, till you have given that Satisfaction for it, which the Laws of Christ, our King and Judge, require.</P>
<P>YOU go on and say, "Tutors neglect to pray with their Pupils." To which we answer, that this is either not true, or not any just Matter of Reproach, as you would have it tho't to be. If you intended, by this Account of us, to make the World believe, that <HI>social</HI> Worship of God is not maintained in the College, that <HI>Tutors</HI> and <HI>Pupils</HI> don't attend upon the publick reading of the holy Scriptures, and join together in solemn Prayers, Morning and Evening, you have represented us as sunk into something as bad, or worse, than <HI>meer Paganism.</HI> But then this Re∣presentation is so vile a Slander, that we can hardly believe, that, in the <HI>six Days</HI> you gave yourself to be acquainted with <HI>credible</HI> Persons, and take their <HI>Information,</HI> you met with a single Man, who was false and bold enough to give you such an Account of us.</P>
<P>IF you say, that this was not your Meaning, that you intended no more than to let the World know, that besides those Prayers which <HI>Tu∣tors</HI> and <HI>Pupils</HI> conjunctly offer up to God Morning and Evening, each <HI>Tutor</HI> don't take <HI>his own Pupils</HI> into his Chamber and pray with them again; how does this prove what you seem to have designed it for, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that our Society is <Q>not far superiour to such as are sunk into <HI>meer Si∣minaries of Paganism,</HI></Q> as you say the <HI>Universities</HI> in <HI>England</HI> are? What Law of Christ hath made this an <HI>ordinary</HI> Duty of <HI>Tutors,</HI> that you should think the neglect of it such a Reproach, that the World ought to hear it? If some <HI>credible</HI> Person should tell you concerning any professed Christian <HI>Housholder,</HI> that besides worshipping God Morn∣ing and Evening with his whole Family, he did not divide it into three or four Parts, and pray with each of them again by themselves, would you think this such an heinous Neglect, that all the <HI>British Dominions</HI> ought to ring of it? And would you think that you represented the Con∣duct of such an <HI>Housholder</HI> in a <HI>Christian Manner,</HI> if you should print it in your <HI>Journal,</HI> that he <HI>neglected to pray with his Children,</HI> only because he never shut out the rest of his Family, when he pray'd with them? If you say, that the Case of the <HI>Tutors</HI> differs from that of an <HI>Hous∣holder,</HI> because it is not a <HI>Tutor,</HI> but the <HI>President,</HI> who is ordinarily the Mouth of the <HI>College</HI> in their Address to God; we answer, that this makes the Difference not great; forasmuch as if the <HI>Tutors</HI> have any thing upon their Hearts, which they desire their <HI>Pupils</HI> should hear
<PB N="29" REF="005715_0028_1026CF7CE6FBC838"/>
them offer up to God for them, they have frequent Opportunities to pre∣sent these Desires of their Souls to God in the Hearing of their <HI>Pupils,</HI> by the necessary Absence of the <HI>President,</HI> upon one Account or other, from Morning or Evening Prayers; upon which Occasions the <HI>Tutors</HI> supply his Place by Turns.</P>
<P>YOUR next Reflection upon our <HI>College,</HI> is, that <Q><HI>Tutors</HI> don't ex∣amine the Hearts of their <HI>Pupils.</HI></Q> What you intend by this, we are much at a Loss to conceive. Indeed we are very sensible, that it is a great Duty, which nearly concerns us all, to <HI>examine our own Hearts</HI> with the utmost Diligence and Care. But that it is our Duty <HI>ordinarily</HI> to <HI>examine the Hearts of others,</HI> is not so clear. <HI>The Son of God, who hath his Eyes like unto a Flame of Fire,</HI> hath said, <ABBR><HI>Rev.</HI></ABBR> 2. 23. <HI>All the Chur∣ches shall know, that I am He who searches the Reins and Heart.</HI> Would you have <HI>Tutors</HI> invade <HI>his</HI> Prerogative, and <HI>make the Churches know</HI> that <HI>others</HI> beside the <HI>Son of God,</HI> may, and ought to undertake this Scrutiny? Or, do you intend the Expression in a <HI>Popish</HI> Sense, and mean, that our <HI>Tutors</HI> neglect no bring their <HI>Pupils</HI> before them to <HI>secret Confession,</HI> as the <HI>Romish Priests</HI> do by their <HI>People?</HI> If this be your Meaning, speak out, <HI>Sir,</HI> and tell us plainly, that you think the <HI>Popish</HI> Practice of <HI>Auricular Confession</HI> ought to be introduced in the <HI>College,</HI> that it may with more Speed and Ease be propagated thro' the Country. When∣ever you tell us thus in plain Terms, we shall be at no loss for an An∣swer. If you reply, that you meant nothing of all this, but only intend∣ed that the Souls of the <HI>Pupils</HI> are not taken Care of, by those who have the Government and Instruction of them, that "Christ, or Christianity, is scarce so much as named among them," which you say is the Case of the <HI>Universities</HI> in <HI>England;</HI> and that the Counsels and Warnings of God are not set before them; we answer, that if this, and not something much worse, be what you meant by saying, <Q>Tutors neglect to exa∣mine the Hearts of their Pupils,</Q> it is a very injurious and false Representation. And you might easily have known it to be so, upon much less than <HI>six Days</HI> Enquiry, if your Ears had not been more open to <HI>evil</HI> Reports, than to <HI>good</HI> ones.—Is not every <HI>Exposition</HI> of the <HI>President,</HI> and every <HI>Lecture</HI> of the <HI>Divinity</HI> Professor, an Address to the <HI>Students</HI> upon the important Points of our holy Religion? Are not these <HI>all</HI> in some Measure <HI>Profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Cor∣rection, or for Instruction in Righteousness?</HI> And is it not a distinguishing Advantage to <HI>the Youth of the College,</HI> which both they, and their Friends ought to be very thankful to God for, that they have the Benefit of
<PB N="30" REF="005715_0029_1026CF81C2D1F838"/>
these four Times a Week, beside what they enjoy <HI>in common with other</HI> Christians, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>The Exercises of the Lord's Day,</HI> and <HI>Lectures</HI> on other Days <HI>out of the College?</HI>—And as for the <HI>Tutors,</HI> whom you particularly <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with <HI>Neglect,</HI> if you mean, that they are generally so grosly negligent of their Duty, with Regard to taking proper Opportunities to talk seriously and closely with the <HI>Pupils</HI> about their spiritual Con∣cerns, as does in any Measure justify your Reflections, they deny the Charge, and insist upon it, that it is a Slander.—And others of us can with Truth assure you and the World, that besides discharging the more <HI>publick</HI> Duties of our Stations, we have not been wanting to re∣prove, rebuke, exhort or Encourage and direct more <HI>privately,</HI> when∣ever we have had Reason to think, that the Case of any particular Per∣son has called for it.</P>
<P>YOU tell us next, "that Discipline is at too low an Ebb."—This is a Reproach which we had little Reason to expect at the Time when you published it. We had not long before dropped one of our <HI>Tutors</HI> out of his Place, for very corrupt and dangerous Principles, as soon as they came to be certainly known. And we had kept him out till he had given Grounds for Charity to hope, that he was come to a founder Mind. We had also expelled a <HI>Professor</HI> for immoral and scandalous Practices. And can it be supposed, that a Government, which upon just Occasions, would not spare its <HI>own Officers,</HI> would at the same Time wink at the Faults of <HI>Children?</HI>—We have since, for Immorality, ex∣pelled another <HI>Tutor,</HI> who was also a <HI>Fellow</HI> of the House. And these Acts of Discipline, we believe, will convince others, whatever you may think of them, that Discipline neither was, nor is at so <HI>low an Ebb,</HI> as to deserve that we should be reproached publickly with the want of it.—But you say, <Q>Bad Books are become fashionable among them; <HI>Tillot∣son</HI> and <HI>Clark</HI> are read, instead of <HI>Shepherd, Stoddard,</HI> and such like Evangelical Writers.</Q>—We make no doubt but that <HI>bad Books</HI> were, and are, and always will be, too often read in a Society of such Num∣bers, where many are supplied with Money enough by their Parents to purchase a <HI>bad Book,</HI> if their Inclinations lead them to it. But the Question is, whether <HI>bad Books</HI> were then read with the Approbation or Knowledge of the <HI>Governours</HI> of the House? Now the surest Way to find this, is to examine what Books were then borrowed by the Scholars <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the <HI>publick Library:</HI> For other Books they may easily conceal, if they please, from their <HI>Tutors.</HI> Now upon a particular Enquiry into the <HI>Library Records</HI> on this Occasion, as the World hath been informed

by our worthy Friend Col. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> in the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> 22, 17<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>1, it was found, with respect to the Books which you call <HI>Bad</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that <Q>from the 28th Nov. 1732, to that very Day (for almost nine Years) <HI>Tillotson</HI> had not been to much as once taken out of the <HI>Library</HI> by any <HI>Undergraduate;</HI> nor any of Dr. <HI>Clark's</HI> Works for above two Years: Whereas <HI>Owen, Baxter, Fla<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el, Bates, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Willard, Watts,</HI> and Gurse (who be sure most of them may be reckoned <HI>Evangelical Writers,</HI> as well as <HI>Shepherd</HI> and <HI>Stoddard</HI>) have some or other of them been borrowed by <HI>Undergraduates</HI> during this whole Time; and that they are scarcely ever in the Library; and that these Books have been more commonly borrowed by the <HI>Graduates,</HI> than <HI>Tillotson</HI> and <HI>Clark.</HI> This Account (says he) I have before me, arrested by the <HI>Library Keeper,</HI> and desire the Facts may be examined into by any one that doubts them.</Q>—We think we may leave it now to every unbiassed Conscience to determine, whether the Account you have given of the <HI>Books</HI> read at <HI>College,</HI> was fair and just, "at the Time in which you wrote."</P>
<P>HOWEVER, if at that Time you believed this, and all the other Re∣proaches, you had taken up against us, to be true; and that the State of our <HI>College</HI> was <Q>not far superiour to that of Universities, where Christ or Christianity is scarce so much as named;</Q> why did you not act so much like a Christian yourself, as to signify your Apprehensions, and make what Remonstrances you tho't proper <HI>privately,</HI> in a Letter to the <HI>President,</HI> or to some other of the <HI>Officers</HI> of the Society? This we should have taken kindly; and if your Apprehensions had been well grounded, such a Way of communicating them, might have been a Means of much Good, and no Harm to us. But what good End could you propose to yourself in caluminating us thus <HI>publickly,</HI> in your <HI>Jour∣nal,</HI> without ever hearing what we had to say for ourselves? We put this Question seriously to your Conscience; for it is easy to see many Things very <HI>hurtful</HI> to us, which you might have in View; such as discouraging publick spirited Persons from becoming <HI>Benefactors</HI> to our Society, which was to injure us in our <HI>Estate</HI> as well as <HI>Name;</HI> and such as discouraging pious Parents from sending their Children to us for <HI>Education,</HI> which must, in a little Time, bring destitute Churches under a Necessity of seeking to other Countries for a Supply of Ministers. These, and such other <HI>bad</HI> Designs, it is very easy to conceive, that you might have in your Heart; but what Good you could propose to do us by this Conduct, either upon <HI>Temporal</HI> or <HI>Spiritual</HI> Accounts, we confess
<PB N="32" REF="005715_0031_1026CF866170B310"/>
it is out of our Reach to Comprehend. You might probably conclude it would raise our Resentment; but you had no just Reason to think, that it was the proper Way to compass a Reformation of what might be amiss; and be sure not the Way prescribed for this End <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Saviour, thus to traduce us in the most <HI>publick</HI> Manner you could in∣stead of informing us, (when you might so easily have done it) <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, of what you had heard to our Disadvantage. And to the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Treatment of us, we think, you was obliged merely as a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, if you had laid <HI>Christianity</HI> quite aside; since, as you acknowledge, you was <HI>very <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> treated</HI> and <HI>kindly entertained;</HI> and since we believe you must be sensible, from the Sum collected at Cambridge, that the <HI>College</HI> contributed liberally to the Relief of your <HI>peer <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI></P>
<P>WE have now done with your injurious Treatment of <HI>our College</HI> in particular; and shall only observe further upon this Head, what you say of <HI>Yale College,</HI> as well as <HI>ours.</HI> <Q>As for the Universities, I believe it may be said, <HI>their Light is now become Darkness</HI>—<HI>Darkness that may be felt.</HI></Q>—These Expressions manifestly allude to two remarkable Passages of Scripture which you most have had in your Eye, when you used them. The first is that of our Saviour, <HI>Math.</HI> 6. 23. <HI>If therefore the Light which is in thee be Darkness, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> great is that Darkness!</HI> The other is that, <HI>Exod.</HI> 10. 23. where God threatens to send <HI>Darkness over the Land of Egypt, even Darkness which might be felt.</HI>—And now what Idea could your Readers justly form of these Expressions, but that as the <HI>Judicial</HI> Darkness over the Land of Egypt was surprisingly, mira∣culously great and thick; to was the <HI>Moral</HI> or <HI>Spiritual</HI> Darkness of the poor benighted <HI>Universities</HI> in <HI>New England. Their very Light</HI> (say you) <HI>is become Darkness.</HI> And left any one should be insensible how <HI>great this Darkness must then be,</HI> you compare it to the <HI>Egyptian Plague,</HI> which was <HI>such a Darkness as might be felt.</HI> To what Purpose is it then for you to say, <Q>that you had no Idea of representing the Colleges as in a deplorable State of Immorality and Irreligion,</Q> since it is certain you <HI>sought out War is</HI> which convey as strong Ideas to your Readers, as the Mind of Man is able to form of any Thing on this side <HI>the Blackness of Darkness for ever.</HI></P>
<P>AND yet you insinuate, that it <Q>must be so, when Tutors neglect to pray with and examine the Hearts of their Pupils, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and tell us, this is all you meant.</Q>—But pray, <HI>Sir,</HI> what did you mean by these Expressions? This (as we have shown above) it is no easy Mat∣ter to conjecture. But so much seems very clear, that by <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ex∣pressions,
<PB N="33" REF="005715_0032_1026CF892BEC4EF8"/>
and what followed them, you make it out, that our Society was <Q>not for superiour, in Piety and true Godliness, to such Universities as are sunk into <HI>meer Seminaries of Paganism, where Christ or Christia∣nity is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so reach as named.</HI></Q> And this, we think, amounts to much the same Thing, with the worst Ideas that can be conveyed, by saying, that <HI>our Light is become Darkness.—Darkness which may <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> felt.</HI> However, you tell us, "you are sorry," and we easily believe you: But for what? Not that you have greatly wronged the Colleges, and heinously violated the eighth and ninth Commandments of the moral Law; but <Q>that you <HI>publish'd</HI> your <HI>private Informations</HI> to the World, tho' from <HI>creative Persons:</HI></Q> By which, and your asking us <Q>if these Things were not so at the Time in which I wrote? and wherein then in writing thus have I slandered <HI>Harvard College:</HI></Q> we understand you to insist upon it still, that the Facts are all true, and that you are only sorry that you was <HI>somewhat rash</HI> in proclaiming that to the World, which was only whispered to you in the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, by some credible Persons, who are loth to be exposed. But till you bring these credible Persons out, you must take all upon your self. It hath been hinted by one of your late zealous Advocates, that some of your Informers were <HI>Over∣seers</HI> of the College. But we can hardly perswade ourselves, that any of those Honourable and Reverend Gentlemen could so far forget their Character, as to turn Informers, to a meer Stranger (as you then was) of Enormities in the College, which they never took any Care to reform, since their Visitations have been no less than four in a Year, two by their Committees, and two by themselves in a Body. And it may be a Satisfaction to some, into whose Hands this Paper may sail, to know, that these <HI>Overseers</HI> are his Excellency the <HI>Governour,</HI> the Honourable the <HI>Lieutenant Governour,</HI> and his <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>dy's <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> with the <ABBR>Rev.</ABBR> <HI>Ministers</HI> of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> and the five neighbouring Towns; upon all of whom you have implicitly reflected, (as well as upon the Gentlemen in the more immediate Government and Instruction of the College) that they should suffer us to sink into little better than a <HI>Seminary of meer Paganism,</HI> and never tell us of it, (as be sure they never did) when they visit us so often to enquire into our State, and rectify what they think amiss. It deserves to be remarked also, that Governour <HI>Belcher,</HI> of whom you speak so often in your Journals, and with so much Respect, was in the <HI>Chair,</HI> and so at the Head of the <HI>Overseers,</HI> when you wrote these injurious Reflections upon the College.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="005715_0033_1026CF8BF1748D90"/>
You conclude your Answer to us on this Head, with telling us, P. 12. <Q>that you would ask Pardon for the Mistake, if you was mistaken in the disadvantageous Report you have given out of us; that you unfeignedly wish our Prosperity, and pray, that there may always proceed from the College those Streams which may make glad the City of our God!</Q>—Here you don't own that you have been mistaken; but in the foregoing Page plainly intimate, that you think you have not, and therefore you don't here ask Pardon, as some of your unwary Readers may think you do; but only tell us what you would do, if you tho't you had been mistaken. However, we thank you, <HI>Sir,</HI> for your <HI>present</HI> good Wishes, and are heartily sorry, that your <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> Conduct hath been so contradictory to them. We think we have fully shown, that you have very injuriously and sinfully misrepresented us. And now we earnestly pray, that you may be bro't to such a Tem∣per of Mind, and correspondent Conduct, as may prepare you to receive Forgiveness both from God and Man, and may you then obtain it of them both.</P>
<P>UPON the Whole, we are far from desiring you should think, that we see nothing in the <HI>College</HI> otherwise than we wish it was. We too often find such Things as are a Grief of Heart to us, and which, we hope, as they appear, we are endeavouring earnestly to correct and re∣form; and yet not always with that Success in which we should rejoice. And this we believe to be the Case of every pious <HI>Minister,</HI> and even of every pious <HI>Housholder;</HI> that he often meets with such Things in his <HI>Church,</HI> or his <HI>Family,</HI> as are a great Grief to him; and which, with all his Skill, and Care, and Diligence, he is not able to bring to such a Reformation as he wishes for. And this, we are very much mistaken in our Conjectures, if you yourself don't find to be the Case, <HI>if ever you return to England,</HI> with those numerous <HI>Bands, Associations,</HI> &amp;c. which you have formed in so many Parts of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales,</HI> after the <HI>Mo∣ravian</HI> Manner, together with the Train of Officers, unknown to the <HI>New Testament,</HI> such as <HI>Exhorters, Superintendents, Visitors,</HI> &amp;c. whom you have set over them.</P>
<P>THE fifth and last Instance which we mentioned of your Censori∣ousness (tho' not the last by many which might have been mentioned) was, your <Q>pernicious Reflections upon the Ministers of the Churches in this Land.</Q>—This you pass silently over, in your <HI>Answer</HI> to us; we suppose, because you have spoken <HI>something</HI> of it in your Letter to Dr. <HI>Chauncy.</HI>—But how unsatisfactorily you have answered for your
<PB N="35" REF="005715_0034_1026CF8F047A7FE8"/>
self to <HI>him,</HI> upon this Head, the <HI>Dr.</HI> hath shown you so well, that we can very contentedly leave you in <HI>his</HI> Hands. Only, we cannot but ear∣nestly recommend it to you to consider, more seriously than you seem ever to have done yet, of the Guilt you bro't upon your self, and of the Mischief you have done to the Souls of Multitudes of People, by pub∣lishing your uncharitable groundless <HI>Fears</HI> and <HI>Perswasions</HI> about the <HI>spi∣ritual State</HI> of most of the Ministers in <HI>New England.</HI> You tell us in your Life, P. 45. <Q>that your Friends represented to you, that every <HI>Gown Man's</HI> Name is Legion, and that if you could convert <HI>one</HI> of them, it would be as much as converting an <HI>whole</HI> Parish.</Q> If this be true, does not he, who endeavours to perswade a People that their Mi∣nister is <HI>unconverted,</HI> and that <HI>an unconverted Minister is the Bane of the Church,</HI> and <HI>as unlikely as the Devil to be used as an Instrument of convert∣ing others;</HI> does not such a Person do all that lies in the Power of Man, to hinder the <HI>Conversion</HI> of an <HI>whole Parish?</HI> For who will be likely ever to get any saving Good by the preaching of that Minister, concern∣ing whom he <HI>believes,</HI> or <HI>greatly fears,</HI> these Things to be true? And how comprehensive and amazing must the Mischief then be, when a Man endeavours to perswade not a <HI>single Parish</HI> only, but an <HI>whole Country</HI> that this is the <HI>fad State</HI> of <HI>most</HI> of their <HI>Ministers?</HI></P>
<P>THIS, <HI>Sir,</HI> you have endeavoured with almost the <HI>whole People</HI> of <HI>Connecticut</HI> and <HI>Massachusetts-Bay.</HI> For tho' you have not published your <HI>Perswasions</HI> and <HI>Fears</HI> concerning <HI>all,</HI> but only <HI>most</HI> of their Mini∣sters; yet as you have expressed your charitable Tho'ts of but <HI>very few,</HI> and have not named the <HI>many Persons</HI> whom you suspect and judge; you have opened the Door for evil Surmisings to enter the Hearts of the People concerning <HI>almost all.</HI> And what you have done, and others since, who have followed your Example, and trodden in your Steps, hath had an Effect more extensive and pernicious, than any Man could have imagined six Years ago. Who could have believed within these six Years, that in such a Country as this, where every Church hath the Mi∣nister, whom the Majority of themselves preferred before all others that were to be had at the Time of settling, and where the preaching and the Conversation of far the bigger Part of the Ministers is undeniably as becomes the Gospel; and where, if any one is found to preach or live otherwise, he is ordinarily soon removed from his Place? Who could have believed, that in such a Country, such a Spirit of Jealousy and evil Surmising could have been raised, by the Influence and Example of a <HI>young Stranger;</HI> that perhaps there is not now a single Town in this
<PB N="36" REF="005715_0035_1026CF90F62A5158"/>
<HI>Province,</HI> and probably not in <HI>Connecticut,</HI> in which there are not Num∣bers of People whose Minds are under strong Prejudices against their Ministers; such Prejudices as almost cut off all Hope of their ever pro∣fiting by their sacred Ministrations? Nor is the Mischief likely to end with the present Generation; but will, unless some marvellous Interpo∣sition of Providence prevent, in all Probability, be transmitted to Poste∣rity. A sad Consideration indeed! and which may well excuse our Warmth, to think, that, besides such Numbers of the present Generati∣on, many of the Children who are yet unborn, will probably be undone for ever, by the Prejudices, Suspicions, and Alienations of Affection, which you have certainly been the Ringleader in introducing.</P>
<P>IN Comparison of this Hurt to the <HI>Usefulness</HI> of Ministers, and there∣by to the <HI>eternal Interest</HI> of their People's Souls, the Injury you have done to the Ministers <HI>good Name,</HI> is but a small Matter; tho' it be in it self a <HI>crying Sin.</HI> For it is contrary, as you very well know, to as plain Precepts as any in the Gospel. And who of us, when we are bro't to the Trial, don't find that it touches us more sensibly, to be rob∣bed of our <HI>good Name,</HI> than of a considerable Part of our Estate? And you know that the wisest of Men, under the Inspiration of him whose Understanding is infinite, hath told us, <HI>Prov.</HI> 22. 1. <HI>A good Name is rather to be chosen than great Riches.</HI> Nor can you be ignorant how criminal you must have been, in the Sight both of God and Man, if you had attempted to take but <HI>Twenty Shillings</HI> a-piece from one half of the Men, whose <HI>good Name</HI> you have struck at. And yet, after, all, you seem to feel no Compunction for any Thing, but only that you <Q>was a little too sudden; that you did not take more Time before you delivered your Judgment,</Q> (Your <HI>Judgment</HI> then it was and not your <HI>Fear</HI> only) <Q>that most that preach in <HI>New-England,</HI> did not experi∣mentally know Christ.</Q> But pray, <HI>Sir,</HI> how could you have made a just Judgment of this, had you <HI>taken ever so much Time for it,</HI> without a personal Knowledge of the Men, and a Certainty, that either their Preaching, or their Conversation, or both, were utterly inconsistent with an experimental Knowledge of Christ; a Thing which we are perswad∣ed that neither you, nor any other Man hath now, and we humbly hope never will have a Certainty of.</P>
<P>WE shall conclude this Head, with recommending to your serious Review, your own pathetical Words in your Sermon on the <HI>Pharisee and the Publican,</HI> P. 162, 163. <Q>He [the <HI>Pharisee</HI>] say you, thanks God that he was not <HI>unjust:</HI> But is it not an Act of the highest In∣justice,
<PB N="37" REF="005715_0036_1026CF929D64DF30"/>
<HI>to rob God of his Prerogative?</HI> [Is it not an Act of Injustice to <HI>judge our Neighbour?</HI>] And yet of both these Crimes this felt righ∣teous Vaunter is guilty.—<HI>Even as this Publican.</HI>—He seems to speak with the utmost Disdain—<HI>This Publican!</HI> Perhaps he pointed at the poor Man, that others might treat him with the like Contempt.—Thou proud confident Boaster, what hadst thou to do with that <HI>poor Publican?</HI> Supposing other <HI>Publicans</HI> were <HI>unjust</HI> and <HI>Extortioners,</HI> did it therefore follow that <HI>he</HI> must be so? Thou art therefore inexcu∣sable, O <HI>Pharisee,</HI> who thus judgest the <HI>Publican.</HI> For thou that judgest him to be <HI>unjust,</HI> art in the very Act of judging <HI>unjust thy self. Thy Sacrifice is only the Sacrifice of a Fool.</HI></Q>—Here you tell us, that the <HI>Pharisee</HI> was <HI>unjust</HI> both to <HI>God and Man,</HI> when he judged his Neighbour, tho' but a <HI>Publican.</HI> And you call him a <HI>self-righteous Vaunter,</HI> and <HI>a proud confident Boaster</HI> for it: Tell him he is <HI>inexcusa∣ble,</HI> and <HI>his Sacrifice but the Sacrifice of a Fool.</HI> And now, <HI>Sir,</HI> we be∣seech you to compare what this <HI>Pharisee</HI> had done, with what <HI>you</HI> have done yourself, and let Conscience do its Office.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Pharisee</HI> had said, <HI>God, I thank thee, that I am not as other Men</HI> are, Extortioners, Unjust, Adulterers.—<HI>I fast twice a Week, I give Tithes of all I possess.</HI>—He was a moral honest and a devout Man in his own Conceit; and he was thankful to God for it. But then he had so much Modesty, that <HI>he prayed thus,</HI> or (as it is in the Original) <HI>these Things, with himself.</HI> He did not proclaim them in the Ears of the People.—How far was this <HI>Pharisee's</HI> vain Confidence of boasting short of <HI>yours,</HI> who tell the World upon every Occasion, in your <HI>Jour∣nals,</HI> that <HI>you have had great Communications from God;</HI> that <HI>God hath given you a double Portion of his Spirit indeed;</HI> that <HI>Divine Manifestations flow in so fast, that your frail Tabernacle is scarce able to sustain them;</HI> that <HI>the holy Ghost enabled you to speak with a great deal of Power;</HI> that you <HI>felt the holy Ghost come upon you,</HI> and <HI>never spoke on that wise before;</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c?</P>
<P>AGAIN; The <HI>Pharisee</HI> not only <HI>applauded himself,</HI> but you say, <Q>he <HI>judged the Publican,</HI> and perhaps pointed at the poor Man, that others might treat him with the like Contempt.</Q>—However, it was but a <HI>single Man</HI> whom he treated thus, and he a <HI>Publican,</HI> whom per∣haps he might know to have deserved a bad Character but lately, and whose <HI>Usefulness</HI> could not be much hurt by what he said; that Order of Men being only Farmers of the Tributes, and already infamous among the <HI>Jews.</HI>—Whereas you have judged <HI>great Numbers</HI> of Men,
<PB N="38" REF="005715_0037_1026CF9676ED8600"/>
most of them <HI>utter Strangers</HI> to you, who were generally <HI>esteemed highly</HI> before you had <HI>defamed</HI> them; and whose <HI>Usefulness</HI> is of the <HI>greatest Importance</HI> to the Souls of others, of any Order of Men in the World.—And as if it was not enough to "point the poor Men out," <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>N. E.</HI> Journ. P. 70.</NOTE> that up∣on <Q>seeing a great Number of them around and before, you took Occasion to open your Mouth boldly against unconverted Ministers,</Q> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as if this was not enough to make the People understand whom you meant; as soon as you was out of <HI>New-England,</HI> you turned about, and told them by your Journal in Effect, <HI>the most of your Ministers</HI> are the Men, whom I intended.</P>
<P>BUT what was the <HI>Judgment</HI> which this <HI>unjust, boasting Pharisee</HI> passed upon the <HI>Publican?</HI>—Why truly, that he was not so good a Man as his admired self. <HI>I am not as this Publican.</HI>—If you had said no more concerning the Ministers of <HI>New England,</HI> (tho' this would have been bad enough, since God hath declared of them, who say <HI>stand by thy self, come not near to me, for I am holier than thou, these are a Smoak in my Nose,</HI> Isaiah 65. 5. yet) we believe we should hardly have given you, or ourselves any Trouble on this Head.—But <HI>your Judgment</HI> of <HI>most</HI> of the <HI>Ministers</HI> was, that they did not <HI>experimentally know Christ;</HI> that is, in other Language of your own, that they were <HI>half Beasts and half Devils; the Bane of the Churches of Christ;</HI> as <HI>unlikely to convert People as the Devil,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. Now supposing that Ministers of <HI>other Countries,</HI> whom you might have had Opportunity to know, deserved so vile Character; did it therefore follow, that the Ministers of <HI>New∣England</HI> did so too? Thou art not therefore <HI>inexcusable, O Man,</HI> who hast thus judged the Ministers of Christ. For thou that judgest them to be the <HI>Bane of the Christian Church,</HI> &amp;c. "Unjustly <HI>robbest God of his Prerogative,"</HI> and (as far as in thee lies) destroyest the good Name and Usefulness of his Ministers, and the Souls commmitted to their Care.—Your Conclusion, <HI>thy Sacrifice,</HI> &amp;c. is so severe and sad, that God for∣bid we should make it of <HI>you,</HI> as you do of the <HI>Pharisee.</HI> However, thus much we must say, that till you have humbled yourself before God and Man, for unjustly robing God of his Prerogative, and doing so much Injury to the Names and Souls of Men: And till you have done thus, in the same publick Manner you did the Injuries, we cannot think you fit to be admitted into a Pulpit, or to the Table of the Lord.—We pray God it may <HI>sink deep into your Heart,</HI> that you are so much
<PB N="39" REF="005715_0038_1026CF9A45C3A5A0"/>
more liable to the same Condemnation, than the <HI>unjust Pharisee,</HI> upon whom you have passed the severe Judgment above rehearsed, <HI>Thy Sacri∣fice is only the Sacrifice of a Fool.</HI></P>
<P>WE proceed now to another Charge in our Testimony against you, as <Q>a Deluder of the People, with respect to the Collections of Money, which, when here before, you almost <HI>extorted</HI> from them.</Q> To the Word <HI>extorted,</HI> you take Exception, and say, P. 13. <Q>You never saw People in all Appearance, offer more willingly, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> And we readily say so too. By the Word <HI>extorted,</HI> we only meant, that you raised the Passions of the People so high, that they were more governed by them, than directed by their Reason, in their Contributions. And of this we need no other Evidence, than that it was impossible they should understand∣ingly approve your Prudence, in pitching upon the Place to build an <HI>Orphan House.</HI> For what wise Man would have chosen, for that Pur∣pose, the remotest Corner of the King's Dominions, a Frontier, exposed to the Incursions of Enemies; and an infant Plantation, where it must cost three Times as much to maintain poor Children, as in an old well settled Colony? And yet instead of removing the Children from that Place, from which you had design'd to disengage your self several Months before, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Journ. from <HI>N. E.</HI> to <HI>Falmouth,</HI> P 35. <HI>Falmouth,</HI> P. 33.</NOTE> to a Place more convenient, you spoke of carrying Children from other Places thither. We think then we may safely conclude, that every Man's Reason must have been against encouraging an <HI>House of Charity</HI> scituated so inconveniently, if it had not been over born by his Passions. We therefore justly supposed, and doubt not but we may appeal to the Consciences of most who contributed, that the great Things which moved them to it (besides the Warmth excited in their Passions) were the high Opinion they had conceived of <HI>your</HI> Piety, Zeal and Faith∣fulness; and because they apprehended it would be an uncommon Blessing to the poor Children, to have their Bodies and Souls both under the personal Care of such a Man as Mr. <HI>Whitefield.</HI> And if this was the Case (as we verily believe it was) then whatever Tokens of Respect and Affection People might have cheerfully given you for <HI>yourself;</HI> yet can you imagine, that they would generally have given any Thing for your <HI>Orphan House,</HI> provided you had told them publickly and plainly, that you did not intend yourself to take Care either of the Bodies or Souls of the Children; that upon your Return to <HI>Georgia</HI> with what you collec∣ted (which was upwards of 700<HI>l.

tarry so much as <HI>one Fortnight</HI> with the Orphans? and that perhaps you might continue your Travels in other Countries, so as never to see them again in more than four Years? but that you would commit the <HI>spiritu∣al Affairs</HI> of your Orphan House to Mr. <HI>Barber,</HI> and the <HI>outward Affairs</HI> of it to Mr. <HI>Habersham,</HI> Gentlemen of no Name or Character in these Parts of <HI>New England,</HI> nor so much as known by Name perhaps to one among Multitudes of your Contributors?</P>
<P>BUT you say, P. 14. <Q>Did I not mention Mr. <HI>Barber</HI> publickly at the Time of collecting, as one of their own Countrey Men, and bred up in one of their own Colleges? Was he not with me in Person? And did I not again and again declare, that he was to be entrusted with the Education and spiritual Concerns of the Children and Fami∣ly? Assuredly I did.</Q>—To which we answer, that Mr. <HI>Barber</HI> might <HI>be with you in Person</HI> from Place to Place, and yet easily pass unobserved in the Croud, being but little known in these Parts of <HI>New∣England.</HI> But if you really did show him publickly to the People, and publickly declare from Place to Place, whenever you asked Contributi∣ons, that <HI>he</HI> was to be entrusted with the <HI>Education</HI> and <HI>spiritual Con∣cerns</HI> of the Children, and that <HI>you</HI> would return to <HI>England</HI> as soon as you had settled Mr. <HI>Barber</HI> at <HI>Georgia,</HI> and see the <HI>Orphans no more in four or five Years;</HI> then you acted a fair and honest Part with the Peo∣ple. And when you shall make it appear that these Things are true, we shall readily confess that we have been mistaken, and will publickly ask your Pardon, and do you Justice on this Head.</P>
<P>IN the mean Time we must assure you, that these Things are <HI>News</HI> to us. We don't remember that you made any such <HI>Declaration,</HI> when you moved for a Contribution at <HI>Cambridge.</HI> And we have enquired diligently of <HI>many Persons</HI> who have been present at several other of your Collections, and cannot find <HI>One</HI> who remembers he ever heard be∣fore of <HI>such Declarations.</HI> And if your <HI>Declarations</HI> were not made so publickly and frequently, that you had Reason to think that the People generally, wherever you asked for Collections, were well acquainted with your Intentions, can you perswade yourself, that you have acted fairly and honestly, when you have so deceived the Expectations of such great Numbers of charitable well disposed Persons? Can you think you have treated them with the Sincerity which becomes a Christian, when by not letting them know your Designs, you drew such Sums of Money from them, as they would never have parted with, if they had understood your true Intentions?</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="005715_0040_1026CF9E54DD9168"/>
As for Mr. <HI>Barber,</HI> to whom you committed the <HI>spiritual</HI> Concerns of your <HI>Orphan House,</HI> when you quitted them yourself, we only say, that whatever his <HI>Piety</HI> or <HI>Orthodoxy</HI> may be, in your Account, yet whoever believes the Account given of him by the Rev. Mr. <HI>Hart,</HI> and published by Dr. <HI>Chauncy,</HI> in his <HI>Seasonable Tho'ts,</HI> P. 186, 187, 188. if he be a Christian of a <HI>sound Mind,</HI> would by no means trust his Children under such an Instructor.</P>
<P>WE next observed, that <Q>the Account which you have given the World of your Disbursements of the several Contributions for the Use of your Orphan House, is by no Means satisfactory; there being several large Articles, and some of about a <HI>thousand Pounds,</HI> our Cur∣rency, charged in a very summary Way, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> for Sundries, no Men∣tion being made therein what the Sum was expended for, nor to whom it was paid.</Q>—You tell us, P. 14. we should have done well to have said, "by no Means satisfactory to <HI>us."</HI>—We answer, that we are not the only Persons, who have looked upon this as a Fault in your Accounts. We have generally heard it spoken of as a great Defect, by such Gentlemen as are best acquainted with Accounts of that Na∣ture.—Nevertheless, you are perswaded, <Q>most of the Contributors depended upon your Veracity, and would have been satisfied as to themselves, tho' you had given no Account of the Disbursements at all.</Q>—But the more entire Confidence the Contributors put in you, the more it concerned you to see to it, that they might have no Reason to repent of their Confidence. It is not to be supposed, that you could undertake the Trouble of making all the Disbursements yourself. And if you did not demand an Account of Particulars, with proper Vouchers, from such as you trusted to lay out such large Sums of Money for you, it is manifest, that however upright you may be yourself, yet you was liable to be greatly imposed upon and defrauded by them.</P>
<P>YOU ask us, "if the Account of the Society for propagating the Gospel is more particular than yours?" We answer, there is no Need it should, because their <HI>Charter</HI> directs the <HI>Society</HI> to give an annual Ac∣count to the <HI>Lord Chancellour,</HI> the <HI>Lord chief Justice of the King's Bench,</HI> and the <HI>Lord chief Justice of the Common Pleas,</HI> or any two of them, of the several Sums of Money by them received and laid out, and of the Management and Disposition of the Revenues of the Corporation. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Chapter, Art. 17.</NOTE> This we suppose is punctually done every Year; and we believe you
<PB N="42" REF="005715_0041_1026CFA218D86D88"/>
will not call it in Question. For how hardly soever you have been disposed to think and speak of <HI>Ministers of Religion,</HI> we don't remember you have ever discovered any uncharitable Tho'ts of <HI>Ministers of State,</HI> or <HI>Justice.</HI></P>
<P>You go on and ask, <Q>if we ourselves would be more particular, sup∣posing an Account of what hath been received and disbursed for <HI>Har∣vard College,</HI> should ever be required at our Hands?</Q>—We answer, <HI>Yes.</HI> Our constant Method on every <HI>Audit</HI> Day, is to require of our Treasures an exist Account of all Receipts and Disbursments since the last <HI>Audit,</HI> together with sufficient Vouchers for all Disbursments.</P>
<P>You observe neat, P. 14. <Q>that we seem as much to dislike, and think ourselves as much bound to bear Testimony against the Manner of your Preaching, as against the Man himself, and that in two Re∣spects.—First, as it is <HI>Extempore</HI> Preaching, which we think by no Means proper, forasmuch as it is impossible that a Man should manage any Argument with that strength, or any Instruction with that clear∣ness in an <HI>Extempore</HI> Manner, as he may with Study and Meditati∣on?—But, Gentlemen (say you) does <HI>extempore</HI> Preaching exclude Study and Meditation?</Q> We answer, Yes. By <HI>Extempore</HI> Preaching, we intended, as you might easily have perceived, <HI>taking no Tho't before∣hand what you should say;</HI> as Mr. <HI>Barber,</HI> whom you have entrusted with the spiritual Affairs of your <HI>Orphan House,</HI> declared, long before you car∣ried him thither, that he had <HI>laid aside all Study, and Fore tho't</HI> of what he should deliver in his publick Speeches to the People. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr. <HI>Chauncy's Seasonable Tho'ts,</HI> P. 187.</NOTE></P>
<P>THIS Manner of Preaching, we have observed to be attended gene∣rally with a very frequent Repetition of much the same Things, and so to be an unlikely Way to declare the whole Counsel of God. And we think that in this Way the Preacher offers what cost him nothing, and therefore that it is a most lazy Manner of Preaching; that it is little in∣structive to the Mind, and still less cogent to the reasonable Powers.—Nor have you offered any Thing to give us better Apprehensions of <HI>Extempore</HI> Preaching in this Sense. But if by Preaching <HI>Extempore,</HI> you only mean Preaching without <HI>Notes,</HI> and not Preaching without <HI>Study</HI> and <HI>Meditation,</HI> you could not but be sensible that we had no Controversy with you for that; for we expresly oppose the <HI>Extempore</HI> Preaching we condemn, to Preaching with <HI>Study</HI> and <HI>Meditation,</HI> and not to Preaching with <HI>Notes.</HI> You therefore take pains to justify what we never condem∣ned,
<PB N="43" REF="005715_0042_1026CFA5DDCA7700"/>
when you tell us, that <Q><HI>Timothy,</HI> you believe, was an <HI>Extempore</HI> Preacher,</Q> that is, that he preached <HI>without Notes;</HI> <Q>that this is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Preaching which God hath much honoured; and that you have gene∣rally observed, that <HI>Extempore</HI> Preachers are the most servent laborious Preachers; and that you believe it costs them as much, if not more <HI>close and solemn Tho't,</HI> as well as Faith and Confidence in God, as preaching by Notes.</Q></P>
<P>How could you imagine, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that when we said, <Q>Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> evidently shows, that he would have us believe his Discourses are <HI>Ex∣tempore,</HI></Q> all we intended was, that he would have us believe his Dis∣courses are <HI>without Notes?</HI> Does not every Man who hears you preach, see this plainly enough, without your saying or doing any Thing on pur∣pose to make him believe it? We think, <HI>Sir,</HI> you could not be weak enough your self (whatever some of your Readers may be) to imagine, that this was what we meant. The Thing we blame you for, is not, shewing that you would have us believe that your Discourses are without <HI>Notes;</HI> but that they are without <HI>Study and Meditation.</HI> For there are several Passages in your Journals, which look as if you would have us believe, that you frequently do like Mr. <HI>Barber,</HI> the <HI>Superintendent</HI> of the spiritual Affairs of your <HI>Orphan House,</HI> who declared, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Dr. <HI> Chauncy's Seasonable Tho'ts,</HI> P. 187.</NOTE> that <Q>He depen∣ded wholly on the <HI>immediate Directions of the Holy Ghost,</HI> and that it was <HI>given him in that Hour,</HI> from Time to Time, <HI>what he should speak.</HI></Q> How much does it look this Way, when you tell us, <HI>N. E.</HI> Journal, P. 70. <Q>when I left my Lodgings, I had fixed on, and folded down a particular Text, but when I came near the Meeting-House, I found it much impressed upon my Heart, that I should preach upon our Lords Conference with <HI>Nicodemus.</HI></Q> And again, elsewhere, <Q>The Lord gave me the Text I preached on, just before the Meeting, directed me to a Method as I was going up the Pulpit Stairs; and enabled me to discourse with an uncommon Clearness, Freedom, and Power.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Journal at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> P. 18.</NOTE> These Passages certainly look pretending to much more than preaching <HI>without Notes.</HI></P>
<P>IT is easy to conceive, that a Minister who uses himself to preach with∣out Notes, especially if he be an <HI>Itinerant,</HI> who frequently removes from Place to Place, may have a considerable Number of well studied Sermons in his Mind, and may be equally able at any Time, with the ordinary Help of God, to preach one or another of them as he sees any special
<PB N="44" REF="005715_0043_1026CFA7A5C7E000"/>
Reason for it, or as God may incline his Heart. And if he is in doubt at any Time, which of these Sermons he shall do best to preach, we shall be far from blaming him, if he lift up his Heart in <HI>secret</HI> to God for Di∣rection. But if in such a Case, he should pray in <HI>publick,</HI> before Sermon, that God would direct him to a Subject, or should tell the People after∣wards, that <Q>when he left his Lodgings, he had fixed upon, and folded down a particular Text, but when he came near the Meeting-House, he found it much impressed upon his Heart that he should preach upon another Text;</Q> and that he did accordingly; it is evident that such a Management would naturally tend to make People believe, that he en∣tertained them with a Discourse which he never <HI>meditated</HI> or <HI>studied</HI> be∣fore; and would be very contradictory to that Simplicity and godly Sincerity which every Christian, and much more every Minister, ought to maintain.—Now, <HI>Sir,</HI> you can easily tell us, whether the two Dis∣courses referred to in the Journals above recited, were such as you <HI>had meditated</HI> and <HI>studied</HI> before, or whether they were such as you <HI>had not.</HI> If you say, that they were such as you <HI>had meditated</HI> and <HI>studied</HI> before, we shall be glad to know how you excuse yourself from deluding the People, in a very criminal Manner, by inserting such Passages in your <HI>Journal:</HI> But if you say, that these were Sermons which you had <HI>never meditated and studied</HI> before, then you acknowledge, that you sometimes practise <HI>that extemporaneous</HI> Way of Preaching which we condemn, and which you yourself have not attempted to justify. For we think, all you plead for in your Answer to us, is only preaching <HI>without Notes,</HI> which we never found Fault with, and not preaching <HI>without Study and Meditation,</HI> which is the Thing we condemn.</P>
<P>You go on and tell us, P. 15. <Q>We often see that those who preach by Notes, and write too, as may be supposed, with Study and Me∣ditation, are guilty of as rash Expressions, and vent as dangerous Er∣rors, as those, who, you say, preach either without Study or Medita∣tion.</Q>—To which we answer, that if a Man's settled <HI>Principles</HI> are corrupt, it will be no Wonder if his preaching is so too, whether it be <HI>with or without Study and Meditation.</HI> But if a Man's <HI>Principles</HI> are <HI>found,</HI> we believe you yourself will not deny, that he will be in less Danger of "rash Expressions, and of venting dangerous Errors," if he preaches <HI>with</HI> Study and Meditation, than if he preaches <HI>without.</HI></P>
<P>You next observe, that <Q>what the dangerous Errors are that have been vented, in your <HI>Extempore</HI> Discourses, we have not tho't proper to specify; unless it be, that once or twice, thro' Mistake, you said,
<PB N="45" REF="005715_0044_1026CFAAA12B0B08"/>
that <HI>Christ loves unregenerate Sinners with a Love of Complacency;</HI> and <HI>that God loves Sinners, as Sinners.</HI></Q>—These you acknowledge were <Q><HI>unguarded Expressions;</HI> but say, I recalled them publickly, as soon as I was made sensible of my Mistake, and I think too, before your Testimony against me was published.</Q>—We answer, that several of the unguarded Expressions in your Sermons, when you was here be∣fore, have been taken proper Notice of by others; that the two Ex∣pressions which we specified, we had heard of your using two or three Times; and that you had been taxed with them by a certain Gentleman, more than a Fortnight before our Testimony was written; and yet we could hear of no publick Retractation. And in the hearing of the Gentleman who told you of them in private, you declared, that you <HI>al∣ways said so,</HI> and made no Acknowledgement that you had erred in so doing. From these Things laid together, we tho't we had just Reason to fear, that the <HI>Expressions</HI> were much worse than <HI>unguarded ones;</HI> and that your <Q>bowing to the Gentleman, and thanking him for his kind Information,</Q> looked more like an Artifice to avoid a Dispute, than like an Acknowledgement of any Error.</P>
<P>BUT it is a singular Pleasure to us, that we are now able to declare, that quickly after our <HI>Testimony</HI> was published, we were credibly infor∣med, that you publickly retracted those unhappy Expressions; and that in your Answer you agree with us in saying, that <Q>if they were not unguarded Expressions, they must be a thousand Times worse; for we cannot look upon them as much less than Blasphemy.</Q>—We hope, <HI>Sir,</HI> we shall always be <HI>much more ready</HI> to publish your <HI>Christian Acknowledgements,</HI> than to speak of the <HI>Errors</HI> of your <HI>Conduct</HI> or <HI>Preach∣ing,</HI> which nothing but a Sense of Duty could have extorted from us.</P>
<P>LASTLY, you observe, P. 16. that <Q>we say, we think it our Duty to bear our strongest Testimony against <HI>that itinerant</HI> Way of preach∣ing, which this Gentleman was the first promoter of among us, and still delights to continue in.</Q> For if we had nothing against the <HI>Man,</HI> either as an <HI>enthusiastick,</HI> an <HI>uncharitable, slanderous</HI> or <HI>delusive</HI> Person; yet we apprehend <HI>this itinerant</HI> Manner of preaching to be of the worst and most pernicious Tendency.</P>
<P>NOW by an <HI>Itinerant</HI> Preacher, we have said, <Q>we understand one that hath no particular Charge of his own, but goes about from Coun∣try to Country, or from Town to Town in any Country, and stands ready to preach to any Congregation that shall call him to it. And such an one is Mr. <HI>Whitefield.</HI></Q>—We have further observed, <Q>that
<PB N="46" REF="005715_0045_1026CFAF4CF44CA8"/>
it is but trifling for him to say (as we hear he hath) that he requires, in order to his preaching any where, that the Minister should also in∣vite him to it; for he knows the Populace have such an Itch after him, that when they generally desire it, the Minister (however diverse from theirs his own Sentiments may be) will always be in the utmost danger of his People's quarrelling with him, if not departing from him, should he not consent to their impetuous Desires. And that where an <HI>Itinerant</HI> Preacher hath something in his Manner that is very taking with the People, he hath it in his Power, as we have late∣ly unhappily seen, to raise them to any Degree of Warmth he plea∣ses, whereby they stand ready to receive almost any Doctrine he is pleased to broach: That this hath been the Case as to all the <HI>itine∣rant</HI> Preachers who have followed Mr. <HI>Whitefield's</HI> Example, and thrust themselves into Towns and Parishes, to the destruction of all Peace and Order; that hereby they have, to the great Impoverish∣ment of the Community, taken the People from their Work and Bu∣siness, to attend their Lectures and Exhortations, always fraught with Enthusiasm, and other pernicious Errors: In fine, that from hence the People have been ready to despise their own Ministers, and their Usefulness among them, in too many Places, hath been almost destroyed.</Q></P>
<P>To these Mischiefs of the <HI>Itinerant Preaching,</HI> introduced by you a∣mong us, which we have seen and felt so uncomfortably, you say nothing at all, but <HI>pass</HI> over them in profound Silence. From whence it looks as if the Destruction of Peace and Order, tho' the Kingdom of God be <HI>Righteousness</HI> and <HI>Peace,</HI> as well as <HI>Joy in the Holy Ghost</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 14. 17.</NOTE>; that the tak∣ing People from their Work and Business, to attend publick religious Exercises, much oftner than the Word of God requires or allows; that the Propagation of Enthusiasm and Errors, which <HI>your Way of itinera∣ting,</HI> without ever offering yourself to any previous Examination by the standing Ministry, opens a wide and effectual Door for; and that the rendering of the standing Ministry, tho' uncorrupt in Doctrine, and un∣blameable in Life, the Objects of their People's Contempt and Abhor∣rence, and so utterly destroying their Usefulness: All these Things seem to be of too little Weight with you, to deserve one Syllable of an Answer.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="005715_0046_1026CFB0D0A0AEF0"/>
BUT tho' you say nothing to these, yet you "own our Charge," that you are such an Itinerant Preacher as we have described, and <Q>declare yourself willing to put the Case on the same Issue as we do, <HI>namely,</HI> that if there was any Thing leading to this manner of Management in the Directions and Instructions given, either by our Saviour or his Apostles, we ought to be silent; and so would a Man of any Mo∣desty, if (on the other Head) there be nothing in the New Testament leading to it.</Q> To which we added, <Q>Surely Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> will not have the Face to pretend he acts now as an <HI>Evangelist.</HI> For the Duty of that Officer certainly was not to go preaching of his own Head from one Church to another, where Officers were already settled, and the Gospel fully and faithfully preached.</Q> You answer, P. 16th. <Q>Indeed, Gentlemen, I do, [pretend to act as an Evangelist] if by an Evangelist you mean, what the Scripture, I presume, means, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> one that hath no particular Charge of his own, but goes about from Coun∣try to Country, or from Town to Town in any Country, and stands ready to preach to any Congregation that shall call him to it.</Q></P>
<P>HOW could you imagine, <HI>Sir,</HI> that this is what we mean by an <HI>Evan∣gelist,</HI> when it is our Description of the <HI>Itinerant Preacher,</HI> whom we condemn? Would you perswade the People, that we condemn one of these sorts of Officers, whom our <HI>ascended Saviour gave, for the perfect∣ing of the Saints, for the Work of the Ministry, for the edifying of the Body of Christ</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eph. 4. 8, 12.</NOTE>? Have we not plainly intimated, that we think there is "nothing in the New Testament leading to such a Management," as that of the <HI>Itinerant</HI> we have described?—Well, but whatever <HI>we</HI> mean, <HI>"you</HI> presume this is what <HI>the Scripture means</HI> by an <HI>Evangelist."</HI> For say you, <Q>does not that general Commission given by our Lord to his Apostles, <HI>Go ye into all the World, and preach the Gospel to every Creature,</HI> authorize the Ministers of Christ, <HI>even to the End of the World,</HI> to preach the Gospel in any Town and Country, tho' <HI>not of their own Head,</HI> yet whenever or wherever <HI>Providence should open a Door,</HI> even tho' it should be in a Place <HI>where Officers are already settled, and the Gospel is fully and faithfully preached?</HI> This, I humbly apprehend, is every Gospel Minister's <HI>indisputable Priviledge.</HI></Q>—But how does this arguing prove, that you now act as an <HI>Evangelist,</HI> according to the Scripture Meaning of the Word, namely an Officer distinct from an <HI>Apostle, Prophet, Pastor</HI> or <HI>Teacher,</HI> which is what you
<PB N="48" REF="005715_0047_1026CFB2705857C0"/>
ought to have proved, if you could? Does that general Commission given by our Lord to his Apostles, <HI>Go ye into all the World and preach the Gospel to every Creature,</HI> prove, that a Man who hath no particular Charge of his own, but goes about from Country to Country, or from Town to Town in any Country, and stands ready to preach to any Congregation that shall call him to it, is neither <HI>Apostle, Prophet, Pastor</HI> nor <HI>Teacher,</HI> but <HI>indeed an Evangelist,</HI> according to the Scripture Mean∣ing of the Word? Or if we should grant, that it is the <HI>indisputable Priviledge</HI> of every Gospel Minister, to preach the Gospel in any Town and Country, <HI>not of his own Head,</HI> but <HI>whenever</HI> or <HI>wherever Providence shall open a Door,</HI> even tho' it should be in a Place where Officers are already settled, and the Gospel is fully and faithfully preached; will it thence follow, that it is the Duty or the indisputable Priviledge of every Minister of the Gospel, to do as you have done? who have <HI>of your own Head,</HI> so far as yet appears to the World, thrown up your Pastoral Relation to the Flock, <HI>over which the Holy Ghost had made you an Over∣seer,</HI> and whom you had been charged to <HI>take Heed to and feed,</HI> as ever you would consult the Safety of your own Soul; and who instead of waiting for <HI>Providence to open a Door,</HI> travel from Town to Town, and from Country to Country, <HI>pushing at every Door,</HI> and encouraging the People to do so too, that it may be <HI>burst open,</HI> and Way be made for you to enter into <HI>other Men's Labours,</HI> where Officers are already settled, and the Gospel is fully and faithfully preached. Did <HI>Timothy or Titus,</HI> or any other of whom you read in the New Testament, <HI>do the Work of an Evangelist</HI> after this Manner? We find that <HI>Timothy,</HI> not of his own Head, but by Order from the inspired Apostle <HI>Paul, abode at Ephesus, to charge some who taught other Doctrines, and gave Heed to Fables and endless Genealogies,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1. Tim. 1. 4.</NOTE> that they should do so <HI>no more.</HI> And we find <HI>Titus</HI> left in <HI>Crete</HI> by the same Apostle, that he should <HI>set in Order the Things which were wanting, and ordain Elders in every City</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Tit. 1. 5.</NOTE>, as the <HI>Apostle</HI> had <HI>appointed him.</HI> But where do you find any <HI>Evangelist</HI> in the <HI>New Testament,</HI> without Command from the holy Ghost immediate∣ly, or Direction from an inspired Apostle, <HI>going of their own Heads</HI> from Country to Country, or from Town to Town, <HI>where Officers were already settled, and the Gospel fully and faithfully preach'd,</HI> to let the People know, that if they <HI>lusted to heap to themselves Teachers, having itching Ears,</HI> (notwithstanding the Danger which God hath threatned to
<PB N="49" REF="005715_0048_1026CFB5951C01C8"/>
People of such a Temper) they stood ready to preach to any Congrega∣tion, or Part of a Congregation that should call them to it? We are very sure, that this does not appear to be the Work of <HI>an Evangelist,</HI> from that general Commission given by our Lord to his Apostles, <HI>Go ye into all the World, and preach the Gospel to every Creature.</HI> And much less does it appear from <HI>that Commission,</HI> to be the <HI>indisputable Priviledge</HI> of <HI>every ordinary Gospel Minister</HI> to do so; tho' he hath had a particular Flock committed to his Care (as you have) and been charged to <HI>take Heed to himself, and to all the Flock over the which the Holy Ghost hath made him an Overseer, to feed the Church of God, which he hath purchased with his own Blood.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts 20. 28.</NOTE> If that general Commission given by our Lord to his Apostles, <HI>Go ye into all the World, and preach the Gospel to every Creature,</HI> made it the <HI>indisputable Priviledge of every ordinary Gospel Minister</HI> to do as you have done, to what Purpose did the Apostles <HI>ordain Elders in every Church?</HI> as we read they did, <HI>Acts</HI> 14. 23. since, notwithstanding the solemn Charge given these Elders, to <HI>take Heed to and feed all the Flock over which the Holy Ghost had made them Overseers,</HI> they might, whenever they pleased, leave that Flock to take Care of its self, and wander from Town to Town, and from Country to Country, where Officers were already settled, and the Gospel fully and faithfully preached; and might thrust themselves into <HI>other Men's Labours,</HI> and boast <HI>themselves in another Man's Line,</HI> of Things made ready to their Hands. Are the People of <HI>New-England</HI> willing that every one of <HI>their Ministers</HI> should claim it as his <HI>indisputable Priviledge</HI> to do so? to leave them when he pleases, and go where he pleases, and try how far he can insinuate himself into the Affections of other People and Chur∣ches? If they would not approve such a Conduct in their own Ministers, let them put it seriously to their Consciences, whether <HI>they have done as they would others should do to them,</HI> when they have so much encouraged you, and others who have followed your Example, in such a Practice?</P>
<P>BUT perhaps some will say, that you had Reasons for leaving your Flock at <HI>Savannah,</HI> and going from one Town and Country to another, to offer your Service to preach where the Gospel is fully and faithfully preached already, which other Ministers cannot plead; and therefore you might do what others may not. Would to God that most who have followed your Example, had been of this Mind, and kept at Home. However, to say thus, is to contradict your Principle, that it is <HI>the indis∣putable
<PB N="50" REF="005715_0049_1026CFBA35E46AD0"/>
Priviledge of every Minister of the Gospel</HI> to do so.—But waving this, let us see what your <HI>special Reasons</HI> were, that we may know whether they will bear scanning.—Now for <HI>these,</HI> till you shall <HI>find Freedom in yourself</HI> to publish <HI>that Tract,</HI> which you promised so many Years ago, <HI>to give an Account how you was induced to set out upon this Itinerant Business,</HI> we know not where to look, but into your <HI>Journals;</HI> in which we think your best Friends, as well as your Opposers, will allow, that you have been pretty communicative; and here we find you saying, Journal from <HI>N. E.</HI> to <HI>Falmouto,</HI> P. 12.</P>
<P N="1">1. "That you was resolved to give up <HI>Savannah</HI> Living, as soon as you arrived at <HI>Georgia,"</HI> because <HI>a Parish and the Orphan House together were too much for you.</HI>—Upon which we remark, that at the same Time that you left the <HI>Parish,</HI> you left the <HI>Orphan House</HI> also, contrary to the Expectations of them, who contributed to the Support of it; and have never seen either of them since, and perhaps never intend to. For tho' you tell us, P. 22. that <Q>had not Illness prevented, you had some Weeks ago departed out of these Coasts;</Q> yet we find you still here, tho' very well recovered, and have seen you undertake some Journies, which considering the Season of the Year, were much worse than travel∣ling towards <HI>Georgia,</HI> upon which Road every Day's Journey would have bro't you nearer to a more temperate Climate. And afterwards you tell us, that if the <HI>Pulpits</HI> should be shut, the <HI>Fields</HI> are open, and you can go without the Camp; we suppose you mean, in the approach∣ing Summer. So then, because you found a Parish and the Orphan House too much for you, you gave both up, and devoted yourself to Itinerancy, after you had received 700 <HI>l. Sterling</HI> upon Supposition, that you intended to take a faithful Care of the Orphan House (whatever be∣came of the Parish) in your own Person.—But you go on and say, P. <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Besides, God seems to shew me, it is my Duty to Evangelize, and not to fix in any particular Place.</HI>—Upon which we observe, that what∣ever it <HI>seemed to you,</HI> that God shewed you to be your Duty, it <HI>seems to us,</HI> that he did not shew you how to express your Duty on this Occasion: For instead of saying, <HI>not to fix in any particular Place,</HI> you should have said, to <HI>break away from the Place where you was already fixed.</HI></P>
<P>WELL, if any Man should be so stupid as not to feel the Force of these Reasons for your leaving your Flock at <HI>Savannah,</HI> and setting out upon this <HI>itinerant Business,</HI> you tell us further,</P>
<P N="3">3. <Q>I had it much impressed upon my Mind, that I should go to

<HI>England,</HI> and undergo Trials for the Truth's Sake. Those Words, <HI>the Jews sought to stone thee, and goest thou thither again?</HI> with our Lord's Answer, have been for some Time lying upon me: And whilst my Friends were weeping round me, St. <HI>Paul's</HI> Words darted into my Soul, <HI>what mean you to weep and break my Heart?</HI> I am <HI>willing not only to be bound, but to die for the Lord Jesus.</HI></Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Journal from <HI>N.

Had you not rather great Reason to fear, that the <HI>Impression</HI> upon your Mind to <HI>go to England,</HI> was a <HI>Sug∣gestion</HI> of the <HI>wicked one?</HI> Especially, since it was set on by Passages of Scripture <HI>darted into your Mind,</HI> which were <HI>nothing in Reality,</HI> and but <HI>little,</HI> so much as in <HI>Sound,</HI> to the Purpose? How like was this Case to the Management of the <HI>Devil,</HI> when he tempted our <HI>blessed Saviour</HI> to <HI>cast himself down from a Pinnacle of the Temple,</HI> because <HI>it is Written, He shall give his Angels Charge concerning thee, and in their Hands shall they bear thee up, lest at any Time thou dash thy Foot against a Stone?</HI> Math. 4. 6. The principal Difference between that Case and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> seems to be in this, that the Text which the Devil urged our Saviour with, was much less impertinent, than those which were <HI>darted into your Mind,</HI> or <HI>lay upon it.</HI> For <HI>that</HI> was a <HI>real Promise,</HI> tho' wickedly abused and misapplyed; whereas these were neither <HI>Promises,</HI> nor <HI>Precepts,</HI> but on∣ly <HI>Historical Passages,</HI> which nothing but a <HI>warm Imagination,</HI> or a <HI>wicked Suggestion</HI> could make you think were any Arguments in your Case. And are there not two very obvious Reasons for which the Tempter
<PB N="52" REF="005715_0051_1026CFBDD8BD2140"/>
might <HI>dart</HI> these Texts of Scripture into your Mind? First, to draw you away from your Duty in the Station wherein Providence had set you. And, Secondly, to puff you up with a vain-glorious Conceit, that there was some near Resemblance between you and the holy Apostle, or even our blessed Lord himself, and to lead many simple Readers of your <HI>Journals</HI> into the same fond Imagination also.</P>
<P>YOU go on to tell us, P. 17. You <Q>cannot judge that it is <HI>being wise above what is written,</HI> to give it as your Opinion, that itinerant Preach∣ing may be very convenient for the furtherance of the Good of the Churches, if it were under a good Regulation,</Q>—To which we Answer, that we have by sad Experience found it greatly to the Hurt of the Churches, when carried on as it hath been by you, and those who have followed you, without any Regulation at all. When you shall pro∣pose to the World the <HI>good Regulation</HI> which you think this Way of preaching ought to be under, we shall give it the Consideration which it may deserve. Hitherto we have never heard that you have offered any Scheme to regulate <HI>itinerant</HI> Preaching; but you seem to be design'd to act at <HI>absolute Will and Pleasure,</HI> till the Mischiefs of doing so are become insupportable any longer; and then perhaps, you will offer your Regula∣tions.</P>
<P>You next affirm, that <Q><HI>itinerant</HI> Preaching is certainly founded upon the Word of God, and has been agreeably approved of and practised by many good Men, with great and happy Success, both in ancient and later Times.</Q>—But <HI>what itinerant Preaching</HI> are these Things true of? Unless you tell us this, you say nothing to the Purpose.—We readily allow, that in every Age <HI>Missionaries</HI> ought to be employed in propagating the Gospel in such Places, and among such People, as have not yet received it; or having received, have corrupted it, with an inter∣mixture of damnable Doctrines. And yet, even in this Case, we think Men ought not <HI>ordinarily</HI> to go of their own Heads, but (where it can possibly be obtained) should have an <HI>orderly Mission,</HI> and be <HI>solemnly separa∣ted</HI> to the Work, as <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> were, when <HI>called by the Holy Ghost</HI> to carry the Gospel to the idolatrous Gentiles <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Acts</HI> 13. 2, 3.</NOTE>. But what is all this to <HI>such Itinerancy</HI> as yours, who <HI>of your own Head,</HI> threw off the Care of the Flock which was committed to you, and are now travelling from Town to Town, and striving to thrust your self in to such places, where (it is supposed) you will allow, that the Gospel is fully and faithfully
<PB N="53" REF="005715_0052_1026CFC14E636150"/>
preached already?—However, if this Supposition be a Mistake, and you really believe, that the Ministers of this <HI>Province,</HI> in general, or those of <HI>Boston</HI> in particular, where your Labours have been most abundant, preach any damnable Doctrines, or neglect to preach any necessary Truths, it may in some Measure excuse your <HI>Officiousness,</HI> tho' it won't much commend your <HI>Judgment or Candour.</HI> But if you have this Tho't of the Ministers, certainly you ought to deal faithfully with them, and endeavour to rescue their Souls, as well as the Souls of the People, by telling them plainly what the damnable Errors are, which you imagine they preach, or what the necessary Truths which you think they neglect. Till you do this, we must charitably suppose, you think, that they preach the Gospel fully and faithfully. And then, you are itinerating <HI>after such a Manner,</HI> as you have not yet produced any Warrant for, from the Word of God. We have already shown you, that <HI>that</HI> general Commis∣sion given by our Lord to his Apostles, <HI>Go ye into all the World, and preach the Gospel to every Creature,</HI> will by no Means <HI>justify such itinera∣ting as yours.</HI> Nor do we expect you will ever be able to produce any Thing more to your Purpose from the Divine Oracles. And we are bold to say, that you have not yet, and we are perswaded never will, be able to name the Men of Credit and Character in the World, for Piety, Learning and Orthodoxy, who have either <HI>in ancient or later Times,</HI> approved and practiced <HI>itinerating after your Manner:</HI> We find it hard to perswade ourselves, that you can be insensible, that the seve∣ral Instances mentioned by you, P. 17. can serve no other Purpose, but to deceive the ignorant or tho'tless. Can you have the Face to pretend, that <Q>the Reformation was begun and carried on by itinerant Preach∣ing,</Q> where the Gospel was fully and faithfully preached already? Where were such Places to be found before the Reformation was be∣gun? Or if there were any such Places to be found, was it these which needed to be reformed, and not such as were overspread with Popish Darkness, Superstition and Idolatry? Or would you make us believe, that the <HI>Itinerants</HI> you speak of, <HI>began and carried on the Reformation,</HI> by preaching from Place to Place, to such as were well reformed already;—and by leaving the unreformed to take Care of themselves?—</P>
<P>AGAIN, did <HI>Knox,</HI> &amp;c. and the <HI>good old Puritans,</HI> any of them all (excepting such as might be driven from Place to Place by Persecution) ever leave their own Flocks in the Manner you have done, and go from one Town and Country to another, striving to preach in such Places especially, as had Officers already settled, who did <HI>not <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to declare the
<PB N="54" REF="005715_0053_1026CFC60D6317F0"/>
whole Counsel of God, and who kept back nothing that was profitable for the Church?</HI>—And what tho' there <Q>are Itinerants sent forth by the Societies for propagating the Gospel, and promoting Christian Know∣ledge, both in <HI>England, Scotland</HI> and <HI>Denmark?</HI></Q> Do not the very Names of these Societies suppose, that their <HI>itinerant Missionaries</HI> are designed for Places which they think to be destitute of the pure and clear Light of the Gospel?</P>
<P>BUT <Q>did not holy Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> (say you,) in Conjunction with others, earnestly, and with weighty Reasons, recommend <HI>itinerant Preaching,</HI> even where the Gospel was fully and faithfully preached, in 1657?</Q>—We answer, <HI>not such itinerant Preaching</HI> as yours, as we shall easily show, from your own Extracts from him, in so many, and such important Instances, that every impartial Reader will plainly see, that his Example is much more against you, than for you. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. THE Itinerants proposed by Mr. <HI>Baxter,</HI> <Q>were to be chosen by the Ministers of the County, out of the most lively, yet sober, peaceable, orthodox Men.</Q>—They were not to be <HI>Strangers,</HI> who were so often removing from Place to Place, that their moral Qualifications. Orthodoxy and Prudence could not be well known; nor were they to go of their own Heads, but to be chosen by the Ministers of the County, who best knew them.</P>
<P N="2">2. THESE Ministers were not to relinquish entirely the Flocks com∣mitted to their Care, and turn Itinerants for Life, but were to leave their own Congregations only once a Month, and the Ministers of the Coun∣ty took Care that another should, in their Absence, preach in their Place."</P>
<P N="3">3. ONE great Design of setting up these Itinerants was <Q>to counter∣mine Seducers, and hinder the ill Success of Satan's Itinerants.</Q>—It was an unhappy Time, when great Numbers of Sectaries, of many Denominations, such as <HI>Quakers, Seekers, Ranters, Antinomians, Fami∣lists,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. turned <HI>Exhorters</HI> and <HI>Itinerants,</HI> and over run the Nation; spreading Enthusiasm and Error wherever they came. And therefore it was tho't necessary that some <HI>able chosen Men</HI> should be sent out, to the Assistance of their Brethren in the standing Ministry, against these Se∣ducers. A Thing which may, perhaps, by some, be tho't necessary among us, if the <HI>Itinerants</HI> and <HI>Exhorters,</HI> who <HI>ran without being sent,</HI> in the Years past, and have done such unspeakable Mischiefs to the Interests of Religion, should take fresh Spirit and Courage, from your Return and Continuance in the Country, and renew their Efforts, as several have begun to do already.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="55" REF="005715_0054_1026CFC7916C0988"/>
4. MR. <HI>Baxter's</HI> Itinerants were to send a Letter to the Minister of the Place, and receive his Answer, before they presumed to preach in any Congregation. In which Letter it was signified, that they had no Tho'ts of obtruding their Help upon him without his Consent.—How unlike is this to your Declaration, <Q>that the People have a Right to invite and hear? and that if the <HI>Pulpits</HI> should be shut, the <HI>Fields</HI> are open?</Q> As if the <HI>People</HI> were not in so much Hazard from <HI>seducing Spirits</HI> in the <HI>Field,</HI> as in the <HI>Pulpit;</HI> and as if the <HI>Ministers</HI> were not as much concer∣ned to warn their Flocks of the Sin and Danger of indulging an <HI>itching Ear, and of heaping to themselves Teachers after their own Lusts,</HI> in one Place as in another.</P>
<P N="5">5. AND lastly, the Ministers who chose and sent the <HI>Itinerants</HI> whom Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> recommends, declare, that they will be so far from being likely to sow any <HI>Errors,</HI> or cause <HI>Divisions,</HI> or to <HI>draw the Hearts of the People from their own faithful Pastors,</HI> that they <HI>will be forward to assist them</HI> against any such Distempers in their Flocks.—And Dr. <HI>Galamy,</HI> in his Abridgement of Mr. <HI>Baxter's</HI> Life, tells us, P. 121. That wherever these Itinerants came, <Q>they were to say somewhat to draw the People to the Honour and special Regard of their own Pastors; that how weak soever they were, they might see that the Design was not to draw away the Hearts of the People from them, but strengthen their Hands, and help them in their Work.</Q>—How very different from this hath been <HI>your</HI> Behaviour, who have told the People of <HI>New England,</HI> that <HI>unconverted Ministers are the Bane of the Christian Church,</HI> and that <HI>you feared many, yea, most of their Ministers were such?</HI> And in this pernicious Practice of filling the Minds of Peo∣ple with <HI>evil Surmises</HI> of their Ministers, and so hurting the Ministers Usefulness, and wronging the Souls of the People, we don't know of one Itinerant or Exhorter that hath followed you, who hath not too exactly copied after you.—</P>
<P>WE think we have now made it very plain, that neither the Text of Scripture which you produce, nor any of the Examples you cite from History, do by any Means justify <HI>such an Itinerancy as yours</HI> hath been; and that you have greatly, tho' we don't say wilfully, imposed upon such Readers as knew no better, in every one of your Historical Ex∣amples.</P>
<P>AND now, <HI>Sir,</HI> we cannot but express our very great Surprise, that you should go on, and dare to say, as P. 20. <Q>This is, and shall be my Endeavour, and was so when I was here last, <HI>my Conscience also
<PB N="56" REF="005715_0055_1026CFCA4DB22E08"/>
bearing me Witness in the Holy Ghost.</HI></Q> If by this you mean, that it is, and shall be your Endeavour, and was so when you was here last, to conform <HI>your Itinerancy</HI> to Mr. <HI>Baxter's Model,</HI> (and we can make nothing else of this solemn Protestation) it is altogether unaccountable.</P>
<P><HI>Does your Conscience bear you Witness in the Holy Ghost,</HI> that when you was here last, you was <HI>chosen</HI> and <HI>sent</HI> on this <HI>itinerant Business,</HI> by any Ministers who well knew your Peaceableness and Orthodoxy?—<HI>Does your Conscience bear you Witness in the Holy Ghost,</HI> that you have not en∣tirely relinquished the Flock committed to your pastoral Care, but that you only leave them <HI>one Lord's Day</HI> in a Month?—<HI>Does your Con∣science hear you Witness in the Holy Ghost,</HI> that one great Design of your coming into this Country, as an Itinerant, was to countermine Seducers, and hinder the ill Success of Satan's Itinerants?—<HI>Does your Conscience hear you Witness in the Holy Ghost,</HI> that you had no tho't of <HI>obtruding</HI> your Service upon Ministers without their Consent, when you bless'd God for it, that if <HI>the Pulpits should be shut, the Fields are open?</HI>—In fine, <HI>Does your Conscience bear you Witness in the Holy Ghost,</HI> that instead of <HI>causing Divisions,</HI> or <HI>drawing the Hearts of the People from their own faith∣ful Pastors,</HI> you have been forward to <HI>assist</HI> them against any such Dis∣tempers in their Flocks? when you have told the People, that you fear most of their Ministers are such as you judge to be <HI>half Beasts and half Devils, the Bane of the Church,</HI> &amp;c. If your Conscience will suffer you to give an affirmative Answer to these Questions, which contain some of the principal Articles in Mr. <HI>Baxter's</HI> Scheme, we beseech you to consi∣der seriously, whether such an Indulgence will not more resemble the Behaviour of them, who <HI>have their Conscience seared with an hot Iron,</HI> than of a Man whose <HI>Conscience bears him</HI> Witness in the Holy Ghost.</P>
<P>WE shall now dismiss this Head of <HI>Itinerancy,</HI> having purposely said nothing more concerning it, than you have given Occasion for in your Letter to us, because the Rev. Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI> hath written so much and so well upon it, in his <HI>Seasonable Tho'ts,</HI> and in his <HI>Letter to you,</HI> that as no Answer to him hath yet been attempted, so we don't expect any tolerable one will be ever given.</P>
<P>WE shall hasten with you now to a Conclusion; only taking Notice, as we pass along, of a few of the remaining exceptionable Passages in your Letter.—You insinuate, P. 20. that <Q>some of your Expressions have been made to speak Things, and convey Ideas which you never intended.</Q> To which we answer, that when you shall have declared publickly, what those Expressions were, and what were the Ideas which
<PB N="57" REF="005715_0056_1026CFCC096F6F90"/>
you did not intend to convey by them, we shall be very glad of the Opportunity to make all reasonable Allowances. In the mean Time, we assure you, that we are not conscious that we have overstrained any of your Expressions, or affixed any other Ideas to them, than such as will naturally rise in the Mind of every impartial Man who reads them. If you have made use of such Expressions, as convey Ideas which you never intended, you must blame your self, and not us for it.</P>
<P>WE see no Reason, from any Thing you have said, to alter <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Opi∣nion, <Q>that you are the blameable Cause of all the Quarrels on Account of Religion, which the Churches are now engaged in.</Q>—It was you, who, by your Preaching and your Writings, first filled the Minds of the People with groundless evil Surmises about their Ministers; and it was your Example in leaving your Flock, and travelling from one Country and Town to another, where Officers were already settled, and the Gospel fully and faithfully preached, together with the Caresses and Applauses you met with for it, which first put it into the Hearts of many others, who would probably otherwise have never tho't of it, to do so too. And <HI>these,</HI> together with the <HI>Exhorters</HI> that accompanied them, have every one of them, so far as we can learn, cultivated the same un∣charitable Dispositions in our Churches, which you did. And even they, who went so far as to tell the People, that this and the other Minister, by Name, was unconverted, seem to have taken it from you, who have strongly intimated in your <HI>N. E.</HI> Journal, P. 77. that you <HI>then</HI> intended to do so, whenever you should come into this Country again. For you say, <Q>Never had so little Opposition: But one might easily foresee much would hereafter arise, when I come to be more particular in my Application to particular Persons; for I fear, many, many rest in a Head Knowledge, are close Pharisees, and have only a Name to live.</Q> You was then taking your Leave of <HI>Boston,</HI> and quickly going out of the <HI>Province;</HI> and what you could intend by that more particular Application to particular Persons, whom you feared to be <HI>close Pharisees,</HI> and from which Application you expected much Opposition would hereafter arise, it is not easy to conceive; unless it was, that whenever you should return into the Country again, you would call such <HI>close Pharisees</HI> by Name, drag them out of their Concealment, and expose them to the People. And, perhaps, it is only owing to the Opposition which you have seen arise to this extravagant Practice of some of your Friends and Followers, that you have been witheld hitherto from doing, what from this Passage you seem at <HI>that Time</HI> to have had in your Heart.—</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="005715_0057_1026CFCFB0065790"/>
NOW, <HI>Sir,</HI> since your Preaching, Writings and Example, have been such as naturally tended to lead into all the Quarrels on the Account of Religion, which the Churches are now engaged in, you may very justly be look'd upon as the blameable Cause of them all. Nor will it much alter the Case, tho' some who may have had a Hand in them, are Men whom you never knew. For tho' you are unacquainted with them, yet they are but too well acquainted with your Writings and bad Example. Would not <Q>the first Founder of <HI>Harvard College</HI> be char∣geable with all the bad Principles and Practices which any of the Members of that Society have been guilty of since his decease,</Q> if they had been led into them by the Errors of his Writings, and by his sinful Example? And would not <Q><HI>Luther</HI> have been justly charged with all the Imprudencies of them,</Q> who said they were his Adherents, but were not, and who by their <HI>Enthusiasm</HI> and <HI>Errors</HI> so much distur∣bed the Reformation; if they could fairly have drawn <HI>their Impruden∣cies, Enthusiasm</HI> and <HI>Errors,</HI> from <HI>his Writings and Example?</HI> But <HI>Lu∣ther</HI> effectually vindicated his own Character, and wrote with so much Zeal against these Men, that they soon hated and exclaimed at <HI>him,</HI> as much as at the <HI>Pope.</HI> We should be glad, <HI>Sir,</HI> to see <HI>you</HI> following this laudable Example of <HI>Luther.</HI></P>
<P>AS the <ABBR>Rev.</ABBR> President is personally concerned in what you say next concerning <HI>your own</HI> and Mr. <HI>Tennant's</HI> Labours, we suppose he will make the needful Remarks upon it, in the following Pages.</P>
<P>YOU profess yourself, P. 21. <Q>a <HI>Calvinist</HI> as to Principle, and that you preach no other Doctrines than those which our pious Ancestors, and the Founders of <HI>Harvard College</HI> preached long before you was born.</Q>—We assure you, <HI>Sir,</HI> that the same Doctrines are at this Day preached in <HI>Harvard College,</HI> which were preached by our pious An∣cestors. We have no Controversy with you so far as you are a <HI>Calvi∣zist</HI> in Principle. And if you had never preached any other Doctrines than those of <HI>Calvinism,</HI> or of the Doctrinal Articles of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> we should not have taken any Exceptions at the <HI>Matter</HI> of your preaching.</P>
<P>YOU had told us, P. 16, that you <Q>utterly detest <HI>Antinomianism,</HI> both in Principle and Practice.</Q>—Upon this we must observe here, since we did not do it in the proper Place, that in your second Letter to the Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> lately printed and spread among us, you transcribe a long Passage (which you had printed once before) out of the <HI>Honeycomb of free Justification,</HI> written by one Mr. <HI>Eaton.</HI> You insinuate, P. 13. of
<PB N="59" REF="005715_0058_1026CFD248FD4CD0"/>
your Letter, that he wrote with <HI>Piety, and Judgment on the Head of Jus∣tification.</HI> And notwithstanding your Zeal and Uncharitableness towards Dr. <HI>Tillotsor,</HI> and the Author of the <HI>Whole Duty of Man,</HI> you don't give the least Hint that there is any thing false or dangerous in this <HI>Honeycomb of free Justification:</HI> And therefore, left your Followers, by your Ex∣tracts from the Book, and Commendation of the Author, should be led to read the Book, and swallow all the Poison in it, before they are a∣ware, we think our selves in Duty bound to warn them against it, as containing the very Dregs of <HI>Antinomianism.</HI> There are such horrible Passages in it as these which follow; <Q>That an unjustified Man that be∣lieveth that Christ hath taken away his Sins, is as clean without Sin, as Christ himself: That after Rebaptization, Men cannot Sin: That God is not angry at the Sins of the Elect: That Justification is <HI>meritorious</HI> of all the Favour and Blessings of God: That Sanctification is the very Heart of <HI>Popery:</HI> That there is no more Sin in the Children of God, than in Christ himself; and upon this Ground, God in Justice cannot punish, yea, nor rebuke them for Sin: That the Believer and all his Actions, tho' Adultery, Robbery, Lying, are as clean from Sin as Christ, or his Actions <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Neal, in his History of the Puritans,</HI> Vol. 3. P. 68. tells us, that the <HI>Reverend Assembly of Divines at Westminster,</HI> who composed the Confession of <HI>Faith and Cate∣chisms, condemned</HI> the dangerous Positions in <HI>Eaton's</HI> Writings, and <HI>confuted</HI> them in their publick Sermons and Writings.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>AND now, <HI>Sir,</HI> could a Man of your Zeal, publish Extracts once and again, from a Book full of such Blasphemies and Doctrines of Devils; describe the Man who wrote it; tell when and where the Book was prin∣ted; implicitly commend the Piety and Judgment of the Author, and not say a Word of any bad Thing in the Book, and yet <Q>detest <HI>Anti∣nomianism,</HI> both in Principle and Practice?</Q> But if you hold the Doctrine of this Book, <Q>that the Believer and all his Actions, tho' Adul∣tery, Robbing, Lying, are as clean from Sin as Christ or his Actions,</Q> your most solemn Protestations are good for nothing. You may tell us a thousand Times, that you detest <HI>Antinomianism,</HI> and yet be an <HI>Antinomian</HI> all the while. The whole Current of your Preaching and your Writings for seven Years together, may be only such as you judge will best serve to engage the Esteem and Affection of the People; and then when you think they are so devoted to you, as to follow any where with im∣plicit Faith and blind Obedience, you may tack about, and preach and write in quite another Strain; and yet after such a Series of Prevarica∣tion
<PB N="60" REF="005715_0059_1026CFD4171A1BB8"/>
and Lying, if you flatter your self that you are a Believer, you will be as clean from Sin as Christ, in your own Conceit, according to the Principles of that Book.</P>
<P>YOU tell us again, P. 21. <Q>I am come to <HI>New-England</HI> with no In∣tention to meddle with, much less to destroy the Order of the <HI>New-England</HI> Churches, or turn out the generality of their Ministers, or re∣settle them with Ministers from <HI>England, Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> as hath been hinted in a late Letter written by the Rev. Mr. <HI>Clap,</HI> Rector of <HI>Yale College.</HI></Q>—You have since received another Letter from that Gen∣tleman, together with the Tutors of <HI>Yale College,</HI> in which we think there is so much Evidence bro't from your own Preaching and Writings, of your bad Designs, that we don't think any Denial of yours will be enough to satisfy unprejudiced Persons of your Innocence. Especially, since you have given so much Reason to fear, that you are of the same Principles with the above named Mr. <HI>Eaton.</HI>—We shall therefore only say upon this Head, that as it appears from some Writings of your own, and your Friends, but little known in <HI>New England</HI> as yet, and by a good Provi∣dence bro't to Hand at this critical Season, that you have in all Parts of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales,</HI> as far as your Interest reached, formed your Follow∣ers into Bands, Associations, &amp;c. after the <HI>Moravian</HI> Manner; and have set over them <HI>Exhorters Superintendents, Visitors,</HI> and are yourself <HI>Grand Moderator</HI> over all, when in <HI>England,</HI> and your dear Brother <HI>Harris</HI> in your Absence; so we may very reasonably conclude, that whenever you think the good People of this Country enough under your Influence to bear it, you will throw off the Mask here too, and endeavour to reduce us to the same Model.</P>
<P>You go on and say, <Q>Neither as I know of, has my Preaching the least Tendency thereunto.</Q>—Can you say so, <HI>Sir,</HI> of your Preach∣ing when you was here before; or of your Writings?</P>
<P>You assure us next, P. 22. <Q>Had not Illness prevented, I had some Weeks ago departed out of these Coasts.</Q> Upon which we observe, that you are comfortably recovered, the Season of the Year is inviting to travel, and yet you are not quite gone, three Months after the Date of your Letter.</P>
<P>BUT you <Q>say, you have a Right to preach, and the People have a Right to invite and hear.</Q>—We answer, we have shown you, that you have not yet produced any Warrant from the Word of God, for <HI>such Itinerancy</HI> as you are practising; and God hath awfully warned the People, 2 Tim. 4. 3, 4. <HI>That if after their own Lusts, they shalt heap
<PB N="61" REF="005715_0060_1026CFD6476E9A68"/>
to themselves Teachers, having itching Ears, they shall turn away their Ears from the Truth, and shall be turned unto Fables.</HI></P>
<P>YOU proceed and say, <Q>I desire to be humbled, and ask publick Pardon for any rash Word I have drop'd or any Thing I have wrote or done amiss.—This leads me also to ask Forgiveness, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> if I have done you or your Society, in my Journal, any Wrong.</Q>—These, <HI>Sir,</HI> are all general Terms. You don't acknowledge in them, that you have drop'd any rash Word, or wrote or done any Thing amiss; nor do you acknowledge that you have done us, or our Society any Wrong. Whenever you shall enter into Particulars, and make your Ac∣knowledgements as explicit as your Offences have been, and shall reform your Conduct, we humbly hope we shall be as hearty and full in our <HI>For∣giveness,</HI> as you can be in your <HI>Acknowledgements.</HI>—</P>
<P>IN fine, we think we have fully made out the several Charges in our Testimony and therefore are not sensible that we have done you any In∣jury.—These Things, <HI>Sir,</HI> I have written in the Name, and at the De∣sire of the <ABBR>Rev.</ABBR> President, &amp;c. of <HI>Harvard College.</HI></P>
<P>AND now, <HI>Sir,</HI> for my self, I can with great Sincerity assure you, that it hath been no small Grief of Heart to me, to deal with you in this pub∣lick Manner: But as these Things have been all made publick by your own Writings, which are read, I suppose, in all Parts of the <HI>British Do∣minions</HI> in <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>America;</HI> and, as I apprehend, you have been per∣mitted to fall into repeated, deliberate, most publick comprehensive and pernicious Violations of the holy Laws of God, I cannot perswade my self that any Good could come of <HI>private Conferences;</HI> but think, that you ought to give <HI>Satisfaction</HI> in as <HI>publick</HI> a Manner, as you have given <HI>Offence;</HI> which I earnestly pray God to incline your Heart to do, and am,</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is one Thing more, <HI>Sir,</HI> which did not properly fall un∣der any of the Heads in the foregoing Letter, which yet I think of considerable Importance, that you should be faithfully informed of; namely,</P>
<P>THAT you yourself, and the other Gentlemen who follow'd the Ex∣ample you had set, were, by a very sinful Misconduct, the first and greatest Obstructors of any in the World, of that <HI>good Work,</HI> which we once hoped God had made use of you, as an Instrument in begin∣ning.—</P>
<P>I observe this the rather, for the Sake of many pious Persons, Mi∣nisters as well as others, and some of them my very dear Friends, who for want of duly observing the Course of Things, seem to have gone too far into an evil Surmise, that the Opposition which hath been made to you, and to such as have copied after you, is owing to a disrelish of serious vital Piety. Whereas they cannot but be sensible, if they will give themselves the Trouble impartially to recollect, that the unhappy Effects of itinerant Preaching, without any Regulation or Restriction, were seen and felt to a great Degree, before any considerable Oppositi∣on was made to it.</P>
<P>You know very well, <HI>Sir,</HI> what a Reception <HI>you</HI> had when you was here before: How that every Man's <HI>Heart,</HI> his <HI>Table,</HI> and his <HI>Purse</HI> were open to you; and you are no Stranger to the very kind Recepti∣on which Mr. <HI>Tennant</HI> met with after you; tho' <HI>be</HI> also, like <HI>you,</HI> was continually endeavouring to possess People with fearful Apprehensions of the Danger of an Unconverted Ministry, as if you both tho't that to be one of the greatest Dangers the People of <HI>New-England</HI> were in, and therefore warned them of it in almost every Sermon you preached. The ill Effects of this on the People's Minds, began to appear very soon. For, as Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI> hath observed, I think truly, <Q>even before <HI>you</HI> left <HI>New England,</HI> Ministers were commonly spoken of as <HI>Pha∣risees</HI> and <HI>unconverted;</HI> and it was not long after, before they were called all the bad Names that could render them odious,</Q> by great Numbers of People, who were hereby put out of any likelihood of ever getting Good by their Ministry, and who were disposed to propagate the same Disaffection to their Children after them, to the undoing of <HI>their</HI> Souls also.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, we still endeavoured to confine our Concern upon this Account to our own Breasts, lest by speaking it out, we should turn the <HI>good Impressions</HI> which seem'd to be upon the Minds of many People, to <HI>perverse Disputings</HI> and <HI>Party Zeal.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="005715_0062_1026CFDDD3360F70"/>
BUT when you told the People of <HI>New England,</HI> a few Months after, in your <HI>Journal,</HI> that you <HI>feared most of their Ministers</HI> were such Men as you judge to be <HI>half beasts and half Devils,</HI> &amp;c. and that their <HI>Colleges</HI> were not <HI>far <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to such Universities as are sunk into <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Seminaries of Paganism where Christ or Christianity is source so much as named;</HI> when the Swarm of <HI>Itinerants</HI> and <HI>Exhorters,</HI> who after your Example, over ran the Country, appeared every one of them, in more or less of <HI>the Spirit of your Journal;</HI> when those shameful Dis∣orders in Practice, and dangerous Errors in Doctrine, which Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI> hath given such a melancholy Account of in his <HI>Seasonable Tho'ts,</HI> were propagated in all Parts of the Land by these Means; when great Num∣bers of People were led to think, that such Ministers as <HI>studied to be quiet, and to do their own Business, and to take Heed to the Flocks over which the Holy Ghost had made them Overseers,</HI> had comparatively little or no Con∣cern for the Glory of God, and for the Good of Souls; and when every <HI>wandering Star,</HI> like <HI>the Tail of the Dragon</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><ABBR>Rev.</ABBR> 12. 4.</NOTE>, drew a surprising Train af∣ter it, and there was no restraining <HI>the Lust of the People to heap to them∣selves Teachers;</HI> then we began to consider more attentively than we had ever done before, that <HI>such an Itinerancy as yours</HI> hath no Foundation in the Word of God; and that whatever promising Appearances it may have at first, and how far soever the Wisdom and Power of God may o∣verule it for real Good to any for a Time; yet, that it certainly tends, in its own Nature, to Enthusiasm, Error, Contention, Confusion, and every evil Work; and must, unless a Miracle of Mercy prevent, be Bitterness in the End.—This I think hath been the real Course of Things; so that I cannot but conclude, that you and your Followers may thank your own sinful Misconduct for most of the Oppositions you have met with; and at the same Time I believe the better Part of your Opposers have Rea∣son to humble themselves before God and Man, that they suffered them∣selves, <HI>at first,</HI> to be governed more by plausible Appearances, than by the unerring Oracles of God.</P>

<HEAD>The Reverend President's ANSWER To the Things charg'd upon Him by the Reverend Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> as Inconsistences.</HEAD>
<HEAD>To the Rev. Mr. Whitefield.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Rev. Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEREAS, in your Letter in Answer to the <HI>Testimony</HI> of the College <HI>against you and your Conduct</HI> (to which the foregoing is a Reply) you was pleas'd to mention several Passages in my Sermon preach'd before the Convention of Ministers, <HI>May,</HI> 1741. as contradict∣ing said Testimony: It is therefore, without all Doubt, proper for me personally, to make Answer to you in that Respect.</P>
<P>As to the first of the said Passages, Pag. 10. <HI>Not but that the Saints may feel this very sensibly, and it is a Joy unspeakable and full of Glory,</HI> quoted as harmonizing with your Notion of <HI>feeling of the Spirit,</HI> as you have it in your Sermon of <HI>Indwelling of the Spirit,</HI> Pag. 364. I answer, in Addition to what is said in the preceding Reply to you;</P>
<P>YOU know, <HI>Sir,</HI> that we, in our Testimony, are far from denying the Sense that the Saint hath of the Operation of the Spirit of God upon the Soul, when he sheds abroad his Love into it, which, no doubt, would be (as you say) to deny all such Operations; but only manifest a very great dislike to the Phrase which you seem very fond of, in that Case, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>feeling the Spirit of God,</HI> being several Times mentioned: This, I say, we very much dislike, as tending to create in the Mind too gross a Conception of his Influences upon the Soul, as some have been led thereby to take the Expression literally, so as to imagine the swelling of
<PB N="2" REF="005715_0064_1026CFE4312782E8"/>
their Breasts and Stomachs in their religious Agitations, to be the <HI>feeling of the Spirit of God:</HI> And methinks you might be suspicious of this Tendency too, if you would well attend to what a worthy Minister of Christ (whose Praise has been in our Churches for twenty Years) lately wrote you in a Letter, after having heard you at <HI>Boston</HI> some Time in <HI>December</HI> last, and before our Testimony came out, which Letter you have by you, in which he says, <Q>When I heard you so much insist upon Persons <HI>feeling the Spirit,</HI>—I was concern'd for fear some weak Per∣sons might be led into Mistakes, for want of more clear and distinct Ideas of these spiritual Doctrines. I think I have Reason to fear, some have very gross Ideas of the Word <HI>Feeling,</HI> as if it were to be taken with respect to Matter, from which they are in danger of forming some Idea to themselves of Christ and the Holy Ghost, as something which they <HI>feel</HI> in their Hearts and Breasts, as they do their Food and Drink in their Stomachs, and so embrace an Image of their own Fan∣cy, instead of the only Redeemer.</Q> And be pleas'd, <HI>Sir,</HI> particularly to mark what follows. <Q>How absurd soever this may appear to you, I have Reason to fear it, which, with many other absurd and unscrip∣tural Notions imbib'd by some, some of which I have heard from the Mouths of such as I have discours'd with,—makes it appear to me, that Ministers ought now to be more than commonly careful, to be very exact and clear in all the Doctrines they preach—of the work∣ings of the Holy Spirit on the Hearts of Believers—.</Q></P>
<P>Now it is in the Manner thus (I think very judiciously) faulted, in which you seem always to delight to express yourself; so in the Sermon we refer to, you say,—we can't have the <HI>Spirit of God,</HI> without <HI>feeling of it.</HI> Again, you think—<Q>you should hinder the Progress of the Gospel, should you tell the People, they might have the <HI>Spirit of God, and not feel it.</HI></Q> And now to argue an Inconsistency in me, in signing a Piece wherein there is so much Fault found with this Expression, <HI>Feeling the Spirit of God,</HI> you mention that Passage in my Sermon, in said 10th Page.—<HI>Not but that the Saint may feel this very sensibly.</HI>—Feel what? The Spirit of God? No; I say no such Thing. What then? Why, <HI>They may feel Joy very sensibly.</HI> Here, <HI>Sir,</HI> it is very plain, I say nothing about <HI>feeling the Spirit of God,</HI> and therefore is this Passage nothing to your Purpose. If you say, we except against <HI>feeling the Spirit of God in its Operations upon them;</HI> yet please to observe, we mean Operations upon their Bodies; as is plain by the whole Run of our Objection. And that such a gross corporeal Sensation of his Operations is agreeable
<PB N="3" REF="005715_0065_1026CFE7917B9218"/>
to your Notion of these Feelings, I think is very plain by that Passage in your Life, P. 29 where you say, <HI>"your Drought and noisom Clam∣miness in your Mouth went off, when you cried out, I thirst, I thirst; as our Saviour did when his Sufferings were near over."</HI> To which Passage, tax'd in our Testimony as an uncommon enthusiastick Turn, you make no Answer.</P>
<P>As to the other Passages you have given us from the said Sermon, I now assure you, <HI>Sir,</HI> and all the World, that I am so far from being displeas'd with the mention of them, that I rather rejoice in it, as there∣by you have given me a fair Opportunity to correct them: For tho' I have a good while dislik'd them, and therefore (you must needs think) cou'd not be insensible of them when I came into the formention'd Testimony; yet I did not think it worth while, since they are upon the charitable Side, to make a formal Business of Retractation; tho' <HI>I think if they had been upon the other Side, I ought to have done it, whether call'd upon or not.</HI> And inasmuch as you have noted them as standing in direct Opposition to several Things in the Testimony which I my self have signed, <HI>"I now thank you, <ABBR>Rev.</ABBR> Sir, for pointing out those Faults to me,"</HI> if you will allow me to give that Term to those Errors and Mistakes.</P>
<P>THE first of these Passages is in your 13th. Page, where you assure us, that what I have said in my Sermon, Pag. 33. is true with respect to you, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>such as have given out a disadvantageous report of us</HI> (meaning the College) <HI>have done it, in a godly Jealousy, for the Churches of Christ, which are supply'd from us.</HI> To which I answer, I then charitably tho't, this was true; but the very natural and easy Connection there is be∣tween your so free Talk in your Journal, of so great a Number of our Ministers being unconverted, and a Design to settle others in their Room (which I have since the printing my said Sermon, been, I think, suffi∣ciently satisfied of) has given me quite another Tho't of you; neither do I think my self obliged to my former Charity for you, unless you do all that lies in your Power to restore the Peace of our Churches, which certainly you do not, without your <HI>honest Endeavours,</HI> that our Separatists, who are your great Admirers and zealous Followers, should return to their Pastors, whereby the Wounds of Religion, which your Machinations have been so much the Cause of, may possibly be healed.</P>
<P>WHAT, in my Sermon, immediately follows the above Quotation is, <HI>That you were mistaken in that disadvantageous Report you made of us;</HI> with regard to which you say, <HI>Pag.</HI> 12. <HI>I shou'd be glad to find the Rev. President was not mistaken, when he undertook, from his own Exami∣nation
<PB N="4" REF="005715_0066_1026CFEA21036A80"/>
of Things, seven Months after, to assure that venerable Audience, on the Day of their Convention, that their Society hath not deserv'd the Asper∣sions which have of late been made upon it, either as to the Principles there prevalent, or the Books there read.</HI> Which Passage, I will not say, hath the Air of a Sneer; but this I will say, that I had made the Examina∣tions I then affirm'd to, and found, <HI>that the Aspersions upon us,</HI> as to the Principles there prevalent, and the Books there read, <HI>were unjust.</HI> And this, <HI>Sir,</HI> I challenge you to disprove.</P>
<P>AND now, <HI>Sir,</HI> suffer me to say too, in my Turn, that I also shou'd be glad to find true, what the <ABBR>Rev.</ABBR> Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> so strongly declares, Pag. 21. where, after you have mention'd the Hint, as you call it, in the <ABBR>Rev.</ABBR> Mr. <HI>Clap's</HI> Letter, as if your Intention in coming to <HI>N. Eng∣land,</HI> was to destroy the Order of these Churches, turn out the generality of their Ministers, and resettle them with others from <HI>England,</HI> &amp;c. you say, <HI>"such a Tho't never enter'd into my Heart,"</HI> as to what follows, <HI>"Neither as I know of, has</HI> (it should have been <HI>had) my Preaching the least Tendency thereunto."</HI> If Tendency to dissettle the Churches be here understood, you must be extreamly ignorant, what effect your preaching <HI>then had,</HI> or very partial in your Tho'ts of it, not to have the strongest Suspicions, that it <HI>had that Tendency</HI> to an high Degree.</P>
<P>THE next Quotation you have from me, with which you so much flourish, is in Pag. 20, 21. <HI>Many no doubt have been savingly converted from the Error of their Ways,</HI> &amp;c. These Things also, I then tho't to be true, but now freely acknowledge, I was then too sanguine, and (to use some of your own Words) <HI>"Whether in Fact it was true or not,—I ought to have taken more Time before I delivered my Judgment."</HI></P>
<P>ALAS, how was I deluded by Show and Appearance! And not only I, but multitudes besides me, who no doubt would be as ready as I am now, had they a proper Occasion for it, to say they have been sorrowful∣ly deceived; and that whatever Good was done, hath been prodigiously over balanced by the Evil; and the furious Zeal with which you had so fired the Passions of the People, hath in many Places burnt up the very Vitals of Religion, and a censorious, unpeaceable, uncharitable Disposition hath, in multitudes, usurp'd the Place of godly Jealousy. Indeed I do not think it proper to apply to this Case, that of the Prophet, <HI>How is the Gold become dim! how is the most fine Gold changed!</HI> As I think I did it appositely enough, in the foremention'd Sermon. Tho' you have intro∣duced it, pag. 12. of your Answer to us, in a very improper Place; but I rather choose to use in this Case, that trite Proverb, <HI>It is not all Gold
<PB N="5" REF="005715_0067_1026CFECC01C1380"/>
that glisters;</HI> for that many, however bright and showy they may appear, continually evidence, by various coarser Mixtures, and especially a large Proportion of <HI>Brass,</HI> that they are no better than Counterfeits.</P>
<P>NOT that I would by any Means deny, that among the numerous Rab∣ble who are so fond of hearing you, out of meer Curiosity, there may be found some <HI>excellent Christians</HI> very strongly attach'd to you; and perhaps more yet, who frequently attend your preaching, left they might otherwise hinder the Success which they <HI>imagine</HI> accompanies your Ministrations; tho' at the same Time they are not insensible of the great and destructive Mischiefs that follow them; whose Conduct in this regard, however unaccountable, as I do not think it my present Business to tax a Fault, so will <HI>such</HI> (I trust) be as far from taxing it as a Fault in me, that my Tho'ts in this Affair, so widely differ from theirs.</P>
<P>AS to what I have said in the former Part of this Quotation, refer∣ring to your personal Character, in those Words (bottom of Pag. 20.) <HI>Those two pious and valuable Men of God, who have been lately labouring,</HI> &amp;c. I hope I shall find an easy Pardon, since it is an Error on the right Hand (for surely an excess of Charity is much more excusable than the defect of it) and since also, you have made just the same Mistake your self, with respect to Mr. Commissary <HI>G—n,</HI> whom you stile in your Journal from <HI>Savannah</HI> to <HI>London,</HI> Pag. 21. <HI>A good Soldier of Jesus Christ,</HI> tho' you tell him in that we have quoted, <HI>you look upon him as an unregenerate Man.</HI> But yet I shou'd have had much more Reason, I confess, to be asham'd of this Matter, if I had ever pretended to main∣tain, That <HI>God at all Times, Circumstances and Places, tho' never so∣minute, and never so particular, will, if we diligently seek the Assistances of his Holy Spirit, give us the particular Assistances we want;—and as plain∣ly direct us how to act, as tho' we had consulted the Urim and the Thum∣mim on the high Priest's Breast.</HI> Serm. <HI>Search. Script.</HI> Pag. 247.</P>
<P>AND now, having done with what in your Letter concerns me, in my private Capa∣city, I beg, <HI><ABBR>Rev.</ABBR> Sir,</HI> (with regard to the College) that, together with all your Bene∣dictions and good Wishes for us, you would please to be so consistent, as to use that Ju∣stice and Caution, as not hastily to believe every Representation of us that is made to you, by such as may pretend a <HI>godly Jealousy</HI> for us, however <HI>credible</HI> you may think <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for that by such a Conduct, you have already (whether you design'd it or not) <HI>really injured us,</HI> not a little, which, <HI>however forgiven,</HI> you cannot wonder if it has given great Umbrage to to us all, and to none more than</P>
