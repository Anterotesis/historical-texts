<HEAD>THE INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Parish of Greenfield, in the Town of Fair∣field, in Connecticut, there is a pleasant and beautiful eminence, called Greenfield Hill; at the distance of three miles from Long-Island Sound. On this emi∣nence, there is a small but handsome Village, a Church, Academy, &amp;c. all of them alluded to in the following Poem. From the highest part of the eminence, the eye is presented with an extensive and delightful prospect of the surrounding Country, and of the Sound. On this height, the Writer is supposed to stand. The First object, there offering itself to his view, is the Landscape; which is accordingly made the governing subject of the First Part of the Poem. The flourishing and happy condition of the Inhabit∣ants very naturally suggested itself next; and became of course, the subject of the Second Part. The Town of Fairfield, lying in full view, and, not long before the Poem was begun, and in a great measure written out, burnt by a party of British Troops, under the command of Governor Tryon, furnished the theme of the Third Part. A Field, called the
<PB N="06" REF="026925_0004_0FD2301CF015BCF8"/>
Pequod Swamp, in which, most of the warriors of that nation, who survived the invasion of their country by Capt. Mason, were destroyed, lying about three miles from the eminence abovemen∣tioned, and on the margin of the Sound, suggested not unnaturally, the subject of the Fourth Part.</P>
<P>As the writer is the Minister of Greenfield, he cannot be supposed to be uninterested in the welfare of his Parishioners. To excite their attention to the truths and duties of Religion (an object in such a situation, instinctively rising to his view,) is the design of the Fifth Part; And to promote in them just sentiments and useful conduct, for the present life, (an object closely connected with the preceding one) of the Sixth.</P>
<P>Many of the subjects, mentioned in the Poem, and suggested by the general state of this Country, easily led a contemplative mind to look forward, and call up to view its probable situation at a distant approaching period. The solid foundations, which appear to be laid for the future greatness and prospe∣rity of the American Republic, offered very pleasing views of this subject to a Poet; and of these the writer has, in the Seventh Part of the Work, endea∣voured to avail himself.</P>
<P>To contribute to the innocent amusement of his countrymen, and to their improvement in manners, and in oeconomical, political, and moral sentiments, is
<PB N="07" REF="026925_0005_0FD265120C099AA0"/>
the object which the writer wishes to accomplish. As he is firmly persuaded, that his countrymen are furnished by Providence with as extensive and advantageous means of prosperity, as the world has hitherto seen, so he thinks it the duty and the interest of every citizen, to promote it, by all the means in his power. Poetry appears to him to be one, among the probable means of advancing this purpose. "Allow me to make the Songs of a nation," said a wise man, "and who will may make their Laws." Poetry may not, perhaps, produce greater effects in promoting the prosperity of mankind, than philosophy; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Lowth's Lectures on Heb. Po.</NOTE> but the effects which it produces, are far from being small. Where truth requires little illustration, and only needs to be set in a strong and affecting light, Poetry appears to be as advantageous an instrument of making useful impressions, as can be easily con∣ceived. It will be read by many persons, who would scarcely look at a logical discussion; by most readers it will be more deeply felt, and more lastingly remembered; and, to say the least, it will, in the present case, be an unusual, and for that reason may be a forcible method of treating several subjects, handled in this Poem.</P>
<P>When the writer began the work, he had no design of publishing it; aiming merely to amuse his own mind, and to gain a temporary relief from the
<PB N="08" REF="026925_0006_0FD23020D0D70130"/>
pressure of melancholy. Hence it was dropped, at an early period; when other avocations, or amuse∣ments presented themselves. The greater part of it was written seven years ago. Additions have been made to it, at different periods, from that time to the present—This will account for the dates of several things mentioned in it, which would otherwise seem to be improperly connected.</P>
<P>Originally the writer designed to imitate, in the several parts, the manner of as many British Poets; but finding himself too much occupied, when he projected the publication, to pursue that design, he relinquished it. The little appearance of such a design, still remaining, was the result of distant and general recollection. Much, of that nature, he has rejected, and all he would have rejected, had not even that rejection demanded more time than he could afford for such a purpose. These facts will, he hopes, apologize to the reader, for the mixed manner which he may, at times, observe in the performance.</P>

<LG>
<L>FROM southern isles, on winds of gentlest wing,</L>
<L>Sprinkled with morning dew, and rob'd in green,</L>
<L>Life in her eye, and music in her voice,</L>
<L>Lo Spring returns, and wakes the world to joy!</L>
<L N="5">Forth creep the smiling herbs; expand the flowers;</L>
<L>New-loos'd, and bursting from their icy bonds,</L>
<L>The streams fresh-warble, and through every mead</L>
<L>Convey reviving verdure; every bough,</L>
<L>Full-blown and lovely, teems with sweets and songs;</L>
<L N="10">And hills, and plains, and pastures feel the prime.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As round me here I gaze, what prospects rise?</L>
<L>Etherial! matchless! such as Albion's sons,</L>
<L>Could Albion's isle an equal prospect boast,</L>
<L>In all the harmony of numerous song,</L>
<L N="15">Had tun'd to rapture, and o'er Cooper's hill,</L>
<L>And Windsor's beauteous forest, high uprais'd,</L>
<L>And sent on fame's light wing to every clime.</L>
<L>Far inland, blended groves, and azure hills,</L>
<L>Skirting the broad horizon, lift their pride.</L>
<L N="20">Beyond, a little chasm to view unfolds</L>
<L>Cerulean mountains, verging high on Heaven,</L>
<L>In misty grandeur. Stretch'd in nearer view,</L>
<L>Unnumber'd farms salute the cheerful eye;</L>
<L>Contracted there to little gardens; here outspread</L>
<L N="25"><PB N="12" REF="026925_0010_0FD264E2ED627820"/>
Spacious, with pastures, fields, and meadows rich;</L>
<L>Where the young wheat it's glowing green displays,</L>
<L>Or the dark soil bespeaks the recent plough,</L>
<L>Or flocks and herds along the lawn disport.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fair is the landschape; but a fairer still</L>
<L N="30">Shall soon inchant the soul—when harvest full</L>
<L>Waves wide its bending wealth. Delightful task!</L>
<L>To trace along the rich, enamell'd ground,</L>
<L>The sweetly varied hues; from India's corn,</L>
<L>Whose black'ning verdure bodes a bounteous crop,</L>
<L N="35">Through lighter grass, and lighter still the flax,</L>
<L>The paler oats, the yellowish barley, wheat</L>
<L>In golden glow, and rye in brighter gold.</L>
<L>These soon the sight shall bless. Now other scenes</L>
<L>The heart dilate, where round, in rural pride</L>
<L N="40">The village spreads its tidy, snug retreats,</L>
<L>That speak the industry of every hand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How bless'd the sight of such a numerous train</L>
<L>In such small limits, tasting every good</L>
<L>Of competence, of independence, peace,</L>
<L N="45">And liberty unmingled; every house</L>
<L>On its own ground, and every happy swain</L>
<L>Beholding no superior, but the laws,</L>
<L>And such as virtue, knowledge, useful life,</L>
<L>And zeal, exerted for the public good,</L>
<L N="50">Have rais'd above the throng. For here, in truth,</L>
<L>Not in pretence, man is esteem'd as man.</L>
<L>Not here how rich, of what peculiar blood,</L>
<L>Or office high; but of what genuine worth,</L>
<L>What talents bright and useful, what good deeds,</L>
<L N="55">What piety to God, what love to man,</L>
<L>The question is. To this an answer fair</L>
<L>The general heart secures. Full many a rich,</L>
<L>Vile knave, full many a blockhead, proud</L>
<L>Of ancient blood, these eyes have seen float down</L>
<L N="60"><PB N="13" REF="026925_0011_0FD26518A38429C0"/>
Life's dirty kennel, trampled in the mud,</L>
<L>Stepp'd o'er unheeded, or push'd rudely on;</L>
<L>While Merit, rising from her humble skiff</L>
<L>To barks of nobler, and still nobler size,</L>
<L>Sail'd down the expanding stream, in triumph gay,</L>
<L N="65">By every ship saluted.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L> Hail, O hail</L>
<L>My much-lov'd native land! New Albion hail!</L>
<L>The happiest realm, that, round his circling course,</L>
<L>The all-searching sun beholds. What though the breath</L>
<L N="70">Of Zembla's winter shuts thy lucid streams,</L>
<L>And hardens into brass thy generous soil;</L>
<L>Though, with one white, and cheerless robe, thy hills,</L>
<L>Invested, rise a long and joyless waste;</L>
<L>Leafless the grove, and dumb the lonely spray,</L>
<L N="75">And every pasture mute: What though with clear</L>
<L>And fervid blaze, thy summer rolls his car,</L>
<L>And drives the languid herd, and fainting flock</L>
<L>To seek the shrouding umbrage of the dale;</L>
<L>While Man, relax'd and feeble, anxious waits</L>
<L N="80">The dewy eve, to slake his thirsty frame:</L>
<L>What though thy surface, rocky, rough, and rude,</L>
<L>Scoop'd into vales, or heav'd in lofty hills,</L>
<L>Or cloud-embosom'd mountains, dares the plough,</L>
<L>And threatens toil intense to every swain:</L>
<L N="85">What though foul Calumny, with voice malign,</L>
<L>Thy generous sons, with every virtue grac'd,</L>
<L>Accus'd of every crime, and still rolls down</L>
<L>The kennell'd stream of impudent abuse:</L>
<L>Yet to high HEAVEN my ardent praises rise,</L>
<L N="90">That in thy lightsome vales he gave me birth,</L>
<L>All-gracious, and allows me still to live.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Cold is thy clime, but every western blast</L>
<L>Brings health, and life, and vigour on his wings;</L>
<L>Innerves the steely frame, and firms the soul</L>
<L N="95"><PB N="14" REF="026925_0012_0FD264E45A6A4C70"/>
With strength and hardihood; wakes each bold</L>
<L>And manly purpose; bears above the ills,</L>
<L>That stretch, upon the rack, the languid heart</L>
<L>Of summer's maiden sons, in pleasure's lap,</L>
<L>Dandled to dull repose. Exertion strong</L>
<L N="100">Marks their whole life. Mountains before them sink</L>
<L>To mole-hills; oceans bar their course in vain.</L>
<L>Thro' the keen wintry wind they breast their way,</L>
<L>Or summer's fiercest flame. Dread dangers rouse</L>
<L>Their hearts to pleasing conflict; toils and woes,</L>
<L N="105">Quicken their ardour: while, in milder climes,</L>
<L>Their peers effeminate they see, with scorn</L>
<L>On lazy plains, dissolv'd in putrid sloth,</L>
<L>And struggling hard for being. Thy rough soil</L>
<L>Tempts hardy labour, with his sturdy team,</L>
<L N="110">To turn, with sinewy hand, the stony glebe,</L>
<L>And call forth every comfort from the mould,</L>
<L>Unpromising, but kind. Thy houses, barns,</L>
<L>Thy granaries, and thy cellars, hence are stor'd</L>
<L>With all the sweets of life: while, thro' thy realm,</L>
<L N="115">A native beggar rarely pains the sight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thy summer glows with heat; but choicest fruits</L>
<L>Hence purple in the sun; hence sparkling flowers</L>
<L>Gem the rich landschape; double harvests hence</L>
<L>Load the full fields: pale Famine scowls aloof,</L>
<L N="120">And Plenty wantons round thy varied year.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Rough is thy surface; but each landschape bright,</L>
<L>With all of beauty, all of grandeur dress'd,</L>
<L>Of mountains, hills, and sweetly winding vales,</L>
<L>Of forests, groves, and lawns, and meadows green,</L>
<L N="125">And waters, varied by the plastic hand,</L>
<L>Through all their fairy splendour, ceaseless charms,</L>
<L>Poetic eyes. Springs bubbling round the year,</L>
<L>Gay-wand'ring brooks, wells at the surface full,</L>
<L>Yield life, and health, and joy, to every house,</L>
<L N="130"><PB N="15" REF="026925_0013_0FD2651B90B44690"/>
And every vivid field. Rivers, with foamy course,</L>
<L>Pour o'er the ragged cliff the white cascade,</L>
<L>And roll unnumber'd mills; or, like the Nile,</L>
<L>Fatten the beauteous interval; or bear</L>
<L>The sails of commerce through the laughing groves.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="135">With wisdom, virtue, and the generous love</L>
<L>Of learning, fraught, and freedom's living flame,</L>
<L>Electric, unextinguishable, fir'd,</L>
<L>Our Sires established, in thy cheerful bounds,</L>
<L>The noblest institutions, man has seen,</L>
<L N="140">Since time his reign began: In little farms</L>
<L>They measur'd all thy realms, to every child</L>
<L>In equal shares descending; no entail</L>
<L>The first-born lifting into bloated pomp,</L>
<L>Tainting with lust, and sloth, and pride, and rage,</L>
<L N="145">The world around him: all the race beside,</L>
<L>Like brood of ostrich, left for chance to rear,</L>
<L>And every foot to trample. Reason's sway</L>
<L>Elective, founded on the rock of truth,</L>
<L>Wisdom their guide, and equal good their end,</L>
<L N="150">They built with strength, that mocks the battering storm,</L>
<L>And spurns the mining flood; and every right</L>
<L>Dispens'd alike to all. Beneath their eye,</L>
<L>And forming hand, in every hamlet, rose</L>
<L>The nurturing school; in every village, smil'd</L>
<L N="155">The heav'n-inviting church, and every town</L>
<L>A world within itself, with order, peace,</L>
<L>And harmony, adjusted all its weal.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hence every swain, free, happy, his own lord,</L>
<L>With useful knowledge fraught, of business, laws,</L>
<L N="160">Morals, religion, life, unaw'd by man,</L>
<L>And doing all, but ill, his heart can wish,</L>
<L>Looks round, and finds strange happiness his own;</L>
<L>And sees that happiness on laws depend.</L>
<L>On this heav'n-laid foundation rests thy sway;</L>

On knowledge to discern, and sense to feel,</L>
<L>That free-born rule is life's perennial spring</L>
<L>Of real good. On this alone it rests.</L>
<L>For, could thy sons a full conviction feel,</L>
<L>That government was noxious, without arms,</L>
<L N="170">Without intrigues, without a civil broil,</L>
<L>As torrents sweep the sand-built structure down,</L>
<L>A vote would wipe it's every trace away.</L>

<L>For each has much to lose. Chosen by all,</L>
<L N="175">The messenger of peace, by all belov'd,</L>
<L>Spreads, hence, the truth and virtue, he commands.</L>
<L>Hence manners mild, and sweet, their peaceful sway</L>

<L>Illumes the general mass. Even those rude hills,</L>
<L N="180">Those deep embow'ring woods, in other lands</L>

<L>Mild manners, order, virtue, peace, disclose;</L>

<L>Through truth's broad fields. Divines, and lawyers, hence,</L>

<L>This too the task, the bless'd, the useful task,</L>

<L>To fix the doubting, rouse the languid heart;</L>

<L N="545">His feet to yonder sskies. Before him heaven</L>
<L>Shines bright, the scope sublime of all his prayers,</L>

<L>FAIR Verna! loveliest village of the west;</L>
<L>Of every joy, and every charm, possess'd;</L>
<L>How pleas'd amid thy varied walks I rove,</L>
<L>Sweet, cheerful walks of innocence, and love,</L>
<L N="5">And o'er thy smiling prospects cast my eyes,</L>
<L>And see the seats of peace, and pleasure, rise,</L>
<L>And hear the voice of Industry resound,</L>
<L>And mark the smile of Competence, around!</L>
<L>Hail, happy village! O'er thy cheerful lawns,</L>
<L N="10">With earliest beauty, spring delighted dawns;</L>
<L>The northward sun begins his vernal smile;</L>
<L>The spring-bird carols o'er the cressy rill:</L>
<L>The shower, that patters in the ruffled stream,</L>
<L>The ploughboy's voice, that chides the lingering team,</L>
<L N="15">The bee, industrious, with his busy song,</L>
<L>The woodman's axe, the distant groves among,</L>
<L>The waggon, rattling down the rugged steep</L>
<L>The light wind, lulling every care to sleep,</L>
<L>All these, with mingled music, from below,</L>
<L N="20">Deceive intruding sorrow, as I go.</L>

<L>How pleas'd, fond Recollection, with a smile,</L>
<L>Surveys the varied round of wintery toil!</L>
<L>How pleas'd, amid the flowers, that scent the plain,</L>
<L>Recalls the vanish'd frost, and sleeted rain;</L>
<L N="25">The chilling damp, the ice-endangering street,</L>
<L>And treacherous earth that slump'd beneath the feet.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet even stern winter's glooms could joy inspire:</L>
<L>Then social circles grac'd the nutwood fire;</L>
<L>The axe resounded, at the sunny door;</L>
<L N="30">The swain, industrious, trimm'd his flaxen store;</L>
<L>Or thresh'd, with vigorous flail, the bounding wheat,</L>
<L>His poultry round him pilfering for their meat;</L>
<L>Or slid his firewood on the creaking snow;</L>
<L>Or bore his produce to the main below;</L>
<L N="35">Or o'er his rich returns exulting laugh'd;</L>
<L>Or pledg'd the healthful orchard's sparkling draught:</L>
<L>While, on his board, for friends and neighbours spread,</L>
<L>The turkey smoak'd, his busy housewife fed;</L>
<L>And Hospitality look'd smiling round,</L>
<L N="40">And Leisure told his tale, with gleeful sound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then too, the rough road hid beneath the sleigh,</L>
<L>The distant friend despis'd a length of way,</L>
<L>And join'd the warm embrace, and mingling smile,</L>
<L>And told of all his bliss, and all his toil;</L>
<L N="45">And, many a month elaps'd, was pleas'd to view</L>
<L>How well the houshold far'd, the children grew;</L>
<L>While tales of sympathy deceiv'd the hour,</L>
<L>And Sleep, amus'd, resign'd his wonted power.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yes! let the proud despise, the rich deride,</L>
<L N="50">These humble joys, to Competence allied:</L>
<L>To me, they bloom, all fragrant to my heart,</L>
<L>Nor ask the pomp of wealth, nor gloss of art.</L>
<L>And as a bird, in prison long confin'd,</L>
<L>Springs from his open'd cage, and mounts the wind,</L>
<L N="55"><PB N="33" REF="026925_0030_0FD26530B28EE6D0"/>
Thro' fields of flowers, and fragrance, gaily flies,</L>
<L>Or re-assumes his birth-right, in the skies:</L>
<L>Unprison'd thus from artificial joys,</L>
<L>Where pomp fatigues, and fussful fashion cloys,</L>
<L>The soul, reviving, loves to wander free</L>
<L N="60">Thro' native scenes of sweet simplicity;</L>
<L>Thro' Peace' low vale, where Pleasure lingers long,</L>
<L>And every songster tunes his sweetest song,</L>
<L>And Zephyr hastes, to breathe his first perfume,</L>
<L>And Autumn stays, to drop his latest bloom:</L>
<L N="65">'Till grown mature, and gathering strength to roam,</L>
<L>She lifts her lengthen'd wings, and seeks her home.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But now the wintery glooms are vanish'd all;</L>
<L>The lingering drift behind the shady wall;</L>
<L>The dark-brown spots, that patch'd the snowy field;</L>
<L N="70">The surly frost, that every bud conceal'd;</L>
<L>The russet veil, the way with slime o'erspread,</L>
<L>And all the saddening scenes of March are fled.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sweet-smiling village! loveliest of the hills!</L>
<L>How green thy groves! How pure thy glassy rills!</L>
<L N="75">With what new joy, I walk thy verdant streets!</L>

<HEAD>GREENFIELD HILL: A POEM.
<PB REF="026925_0052_0FD26581D4DDA4F0"/>
THE ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IN the beginning of July 1779, the British, under the command of Sir George Collyer, and Governor Tryon, plundered New-Haven. Thence they sailed to Fairfield, plundered, and burned it. Eighty-five dwelling houses, two churches, a hand∣some court house, several school houses, together with a great number of barns, out-houses, &amp;c. were consumed by the fire. Many other houses were set on fire; but were extinguished by the returning inhabitants. The distress, occasioned by this act of wanton barbarity, is inconceivable; and the name of Governor Tryon will, on account of it, be remembered with the most finished detestation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>From l. 1, to l. 283, the story is related. The reader is then addressed with a representation of the happiness destroyed at Fairfield, and with an account of the prevalence of war, in ancient, and in modern times; its nature and its effects on the morals and happiness of mankind. This address extends to l, 547, and is succeeded by an Address to the Hero, returning victorious from war. He is first presented with a picture of the miseries of war, on the land; and is then conducted to the shore, to take a survey of maritime war.—Death—Speech of Death—Motives to abstain from war—and Conclusion.</HI></P>

THE ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE Pequods inhabited the branches of the Thames, which empties itself into the Sound, at New London. This nation, from the first settlement of the English Colonists, regarded them with jealousy; and attempted to engage the neighbouring tribes in a combination against them. Several of those tribes were, however, more jealous of the Pequods, than of the English, and rejected their solicitations Not discouraged by these disap∣pointments, they resolved to attempt the destruction of the Eng∣lish, with the strength of their own tribes only; and cruelly assassinated Captains Stone, Norton, and Oldham, as they were trading peaceably in their neighbourhood. The English de∣manded the murderers; but were answered with disdain, and insult. Upon this, Captain Mason was dispatched into their country with a body of troops; and attacking one of their principal forts, destroyed it, together with a large number of their warriors. The rest of the nation fled. A large body of them come to a swamp, three miles westward of Fairfield. One of their number loitering behind the rest, was discovered by the English troops, then commanded by Captain Stoughton, of the Massachusetts; and was compelled to disclose their retreat. One hundred of them, it is said, surrendered. The rest, bravely resolving to live and die together, were attacked, and chiefly destroyed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Neale's Hist. N.

<LG>
<L>Oft have I heard the tale, when matron sere</L>
<L>Sung to my infant ear the song of woe;</L>
<L N="120"><PB N="97" REF="026925_0084_0FD2656D64C3CDE0"/>
Of maiden meek, consum'd with pining care,</L>
<L>Around whose tomb the wild-rose lov'd to blow:</L>
<L>Or told, with swimming eyes, how, long ago,</L>
<L>Remorseless Indians, all in midnight dire,</L>
<L>The little, sleeping village, did o'erthrow,</L>
<L N="125">Bidding the cruel flames to heaven aspire,</L>
<L>And scalp'd the hoary head, and burn'd the babe with fire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then, fancy-fir'd, her memory wing'd it's flight,</L>
<L>To long-forgotten wars, and dread alarms,</L>
<L>To chiefs obscure, but terrible in fight,</L>
<L N="130">Who mock'd each foe, and laugh'd at deadliest harms,</L>
<L>Sydneys in zeal, and Washingtons in arms.</L>
<L>By instinct tender to the woes of man,</L>
<L>My heart bewildering with sweet pity's charms,</L>
<L>Thro' solemn scenes, with Nature's step, she ran,</L>

<L>And steeds insult the plains, and cannon rend the skies."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="145">"They saw, and soon the strangers' fate decreed,</L>

<L>A guiltless offering at th' infernal shrine:</L>
<L>Then, gallant Norton! the hard fate was thine,</L>
<L N="150">By russians butcher'd, and denied a grave:</L>
<L>Thee, generous Oldham! next the doom malign</L>

"Soon the sad tidings reach'd the general ear;</L>

<L>Invasive war their gallant friends prepare;</L>
<L>And soon a noble band, with purpose dire,</L>

<L N="160">Breasts fac'd with steel, and souls instinct with fire:</L>

<LG>
<L>"The rising clouds the Savage Chief descried,</L>

<LG>
<L>"Swift to the Pequod fortress Mason sped,</L>

<L>With howls the Powaw fill'd the dark abode,</L>
<L N="180">And screams, and midnight prayers, invok'd the Evil god."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"There too, with awful rites, the hoary priest,</L>

<L>His sable form in magic cincture dress'd,</L>
<L>And heap'd the mingled offering to his god,</L>
<L N="185">What time, with golden light, calm evening glow'd.</L>
<L>The mystic dust, the flower of silver bloom,</L>
<L>And spicy herb, his hand in order strew'd;</L>
<L><PB N="99" REF="026925_0086_0FD2656EE3EBF7F8"/>
Bright rose the curling flame; and rich perfume</L>
<L>On smoky wings upflew, or settled round the tomb."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="190">"Then, o'er the circus, danc'd the maddening throng,</L>

<L>And struck, to forest notes, th' ecstatic song,</L>
<L>While slow, beneath them, heav'd the wavy ground.</L>
<L>With a low, lingering groan, of dying found,</L>
<L N="195">The woodland rumbled; murmur'd deep each stream;</L>
<L>Shrill sung the leaves; all ether sigh'd profound;</L>
<L>Pale tufts of purple topp'd the silver flame,</L>

<LG>
<L>"Thin, twilight Forms; attir'd in changing sheen</L>
<L N="200">Of plumes, high-tinctur'd in the western ray;</L>

<L>Eve redden'd each sine form, each misty car;</L>
<L>And through them faintly gleam'd, at times, the Western star."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Then (so tradition sings), the train behind,</L>
<L>In plumy zones of rainbow'd beauty dress'd,</L>
<L N="210">Rode the Great Spirit, in th' obedient wind,</L>
<L>In yellow clouds slow-sailing from the west.</L>

<L>And where to wind the scout, and war's dark storm dispel."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"There, on her lover's tomb, in silence laid,</L>

<L>At times, expectant, slept the widow'd maid,</L>
<L N="220">Her soul far-wandering on the sylph-wing'd dream.</L>
<L>Wasted from evening skies, on sunny stream,</L>

Her darling Youth with silver pinions shone;</L>
<L>With voice of music, tun'd to sweetest theme,</L>
<L>He told of shell-bright bowers, beyond the sun,</L>
<L N="225">Where years of endless joy o'er Indian lovers run."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"But now no awful rites, nor potent spell,</L>
<L>To silence charm'd the peals of coming war;</L>
<L>Or told the dread recesses of the dell,</L>
<L>Where glowing Mason led his bands from far:</L>
<L N="230">No spirit, buoyant on his airy car,</L>
<L>Controul'd the whirlwind of invading fight:</L>
<L>Deep died in blood, dun evening's falling star</L>
<L>Sent sad, o'er western hills, it's parting light,</L>
<L>And no returning morn dispers'd the long, dark night."</L>

<LG>
<L N="235">"On the drear walls a sudden splendour glow'd,</L>
<L>There Mason shone, and there his veterans pour'd.</L>
<L>A new the Hero claim'd the fiends of blood,</L>
<L>While answering storms of arrows round him shower'd,</L>
<L>And the war-scream the ear with anguish gor'd.</L>
<L N="240">Alone, he burst the gate: the forest round</L>
<L>Re-echoed death; the peal of onset roar'd;</L>

<L>And gloomy spirits fled, and corses hid the ground."</L>

<L>Not long in dubious fight the host had striven,</L>
<L N="245">When, kindled by the musket's potent flame,</L>
<L>In clouds, and fire, the castle rose to heaven,</L>

<L>And fiercer fight the keen assault repell'd:</L>
<L N="250">Nor even these ills the savage breast could tame;</L>
<L>Like hell's deep caves, the hideous region yell'd,</L>

THE ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P><HI>SUBJECT introduced. Description of a happy village in New England. Character of the Clergyman. He gives his last advice, and blessing, to his Parishioners—recites his past, affectionate and faithful labours for their salvation, and pro∣poses to close them with his last exhortation—estimates the pleasures of sin, and the value of the present life, and urges them to seek eternal life—informs them, that two endless journeys lie before them—of virtue, which guides to happiness; and of sin, which terminates in misery—and describes the nature of both. As means of salvation, be exhorts them to read the Bible, with diligence and care; to frequent public worship; to establish family religion, in their houses: religiously to educate their children; and to abound in all the duties of charity. He further informs them, that all things are labouring to promote this great purpose; recites to them the affectionate invitations of the Redeemer; and represents his own future happiness, as increased by their salvation. Conclusion.</HI></P>

<L>Where western Albion's happy clime</L>
<L>Still brightens to the eye of time,</L>
<L>A village lies. In all his round,</L>
<L>The sun a fairer never found.</L>
<L N="25">The woods were tall, the hillocks green,</L>
<L>The vallies laugh'd the hills between,</L>
<L>Thro' fairy meads the rivers roll'd,</L>
<L>The meadows flower'd in vernal gold,</L>
<L>The days were bright, the mornings fair,</L>
<L N="30">And evening lov'd to linger there.</L>
<L>There, twinn'd in brilliant fields above,</L>
<L>Sweet sisters! sported Peace and Love;</L>
<L>While Virtue, like a blushing bride,</L>
<L>Seren'd, and brighten'd, at their side.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="35">At distance from that happy way,</L>
<L>The path of sensual Pleasure lay,</L>
<L>Afar Ambition's summit rose,</L>

<L>The place, with east and western sides,</L>
<L N="40">A wide and verdant street divides:</L>
<L>And here the houses fac'd the day,</L>
<L>And there the lawns in beauty lay.</L>
<L>There, turret-crown'd, and central, stood</L>
<L>A neat, and solemn house of God.</L>
<L N="45">Across the way, beneath the shade,</L>
<L>Two elms with sober silence spread,</L>
<L>The Preacher liv'd. O'er all the place</L>
<L>His mansion cast a Sunday grace;</L>
<L>Dumb stillness sate the fields around;</L>
<L N="50">His garden seem'd a hallow'd ground;</L>
<L>Swains ceas'd to laugh aloud, when near,</L>
<L>And school-boys never sported there.</L>

<L>His face, the image of his mind,</L>

<L>Not cold; but glowing still, and bright;</L>

<L>YE children of my fondest care,</L>
<L>With tenderest love, and frequent prayer,</L>
<L>This solemn charge, my voice has given,</L>
<L>To prompt, and guide, your steps to heaven.</L>
<L N="5">Your present welfare now demands</L>
<L>A different tribute, from my hands.</L>

<L>Intent to gather honest gain,</L>
<L>Laborious, prudent, thrifty, neat,</L>
<L N="10">Of judgment strong, experience great,</L>
<L>In solid homespun clad, and tidy,</L>
<L>And with no coxcomb learning giddy.</L>
<L>Daily, to hear his maxims sound,</L>
<L>Th' approaching neighbours flock'd around;</L>
<L N="15">Daily they saw his counsels proves</L>

And all, who follow'd his advice,</L>
<L N="20">Appear'd more prosperous, as more wise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Wearied, at length, with many a call,</L>
<L>The sage resolv'd to summon all:</L>
<L>And gathering, on a pleasant monday,</L>
<L>A crowd not always seen on sunday,</L>
<L N="25">Curious to hear, while hard they press'd him,</L>
<L>In friendly terms, he thus address'd 'em.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"My friends, you have my kindest wishes;</L>
<L>Pray think a neighbour not officious,</L>

<L>'Tho but two quarts a bushel gains:</L>
<L>Still rolling on it's steady rounds,</L>
<L>The farthings soon are turn'd to pounds."</L>

<L>"Nor <HI>think a life of toil severe:</HI></L>

<L>It's meals so luscious, sleep so sweet,</L>
<L>Such vigorous limbs, such health complete,</L>

GREENFIELD HILL. PART VII. THE VISION.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>FROM these fair scenes, to wonders more refin'd,</L>
<L>Instinctive turns the every busy Mind:</L>
<L>The present prospect but expands her sight;</L>
<L>The present joy to others tempts her flight;</L>
<L N="5">Allur'd by each new good, she loves to roam,</L>
<L>And spreads her wings, through ages long to come;</L>
<L>Where Time, with hand prophetic, points her way,</L>
<L>And heavenly visions heavenly scenes display.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As late, when Spring awak'd the slumbering plains,</L>
<L N="10">The soul, extatic, burst her earthy chains,</L>
<L>Approaching Morn assum'd her magic power,</L>
<L>And bade her visions bless the fairy hour,</L>
<L>In quick review, Columbia's glories spread;</L>
<L>The past roll on; the present swift succeed;</L>
<L N="15">Behind, rank after rank, the future rise,</L>
<L>As clouds, successive, paint the changing skies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I stood, methought, beside you azure plain;</L>
<L>Still hung the concave; peaceful slept the main;</L>
<L>In heaven suspended, lingering Hesper shin'd,</L>
<L N="20">And purple evening breath'd her gentlest wind.</L>
<L><PB N="150" REF="026925_0136_0FD265D9643CBBC0"/>
At once I heard a solemn murmur rise,</L>
<L>As thunders slowly swell, in distant skies;</L>
<L>The waves, disturb'd, in deep convulsion lay;</L>
<L>The world was hush'd; the airs forgot to play.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="25">At that still moment, from his sapphire bed,</L>
<L>The Genius of the Sound uprear'd his head:</L>
<L>Slow round his form a cloud of amber roll'd,</L>
<L>Now hid, now splendent, through it's skirts of gold.</L>
<L>Gemm'd with new stars, his seagreen mitre shin'd;</L>
<L N="30">His scaly mantle rustled in the wind;</L>
<L>A pictur'd shield his hand, uplifted, bore,</L>
<L>Grav'd with the semblance of his double shore:</L>
<L>Unnumber'd sails propitious breezes swell'd,</L>
<L>And his strip'd flag disclos'd th' unfinish'd field.</L>
<L N="35">Here Longa's bays, and whitening coast, were seen,</L>
<L>Small isles, around her, wrought in living green;</L>
<L>The loftier Mainland there allur'd the eye,</L>
<L>It's margin winding toward the southern sky;</L>
<L>The tall hill heav'd; expansive spread the plain;</L>
<L N="40">And groves, and gardens, streak'd the subject main:</L>
<L>New Haven's spires, in sculptur'd silver, rose,</L>
<L>And York's proud domes, escap'd the waste of foes.</L>
<L>Here a new Thames an infant London laves;</L>
<L>Through a new Tempe, roll Connecta's waves;</L>
<L N="45">With foamy stream, another Avon glides,</L>
<L>And Hudson triumphs in his freighted tides.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He stood, and thus the solemn silence broke,</L>
<L>And brightening nature listen'd as he spoke.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Rise, genial years! and haste, auspicious times!</L>
<L N="50">Ascend, and bless the true, Hesperian climes;</L>
<L>O'er happy isles, and garden'd realms, display</L>
<L>Th' advancing splendours of prophetic day."</L>

Her haughty flags, with purple stain'd, display,</L>
<L>The car of triumph, and the pomp of sway;</L>
<L>Or, wrought with Grecian skill, her columns raise,</L>
<L>Bend the tall arch, and teach the dome to blaze;</L>
<L>In art's wide regions bid her laurels grow,</L>
<L N="60">And place the crown of science on her brow.</L>
<L>Round the mild year, let Albion's verdure run;</L>
<L>Let Gallia's opening vines allure the sun;</L>
<L>O'er brighter realms, the Turkish crescent rise,</L>
<L>Wash'd by fair seas, and warm'd by vernal skies;</L>
<L N="65">Let richer Ind, and prouder Persia, tell</L>
<L>The diamond cavern, and the pearly shell;</L>
<L>Peruvia vaunt her streams, in silver roll'd,</L>
<L>And sunny Darien lift her hills of gold.</L>
<L>Here the best blessings of those far-fam'd climes,</L>
<L N="70">Pure of their woes, and whiten'd from their crimes,</L>
<L>Shall blend with nobler blessings, all my own;</L>
<L>Here first th' enduring reign of Peace be known:</L>
<L>The voice of scepter'd Law wide realms obey,</L>
<L>And choice erect, and freemen hail, the sway:</L>
<L N="75">The sun of knowledge light the general mind,</L>
<L>And cheer, through every class, oppress'd mankind;</L>
<L>Here Truth, and Virtue, doom'd no more to roam,</L>
<L>Pilgrims in eastern climes, shall find their home;</L>
<L>Age after age, exalt their glory higher,</L>
<L N="80">That light the soul, and this the life inspire;</L>
<L>And Man once more, self ruin'd Phoenix, rise,</L>
<L>On wings of Eden, to his native skies."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"To build the finish'd bliss, see all things given,</L>
<L>The goods of nature, and the smiles of Heaven,</L>
<L N="85">A site sequester'd, policy sublime,</L>
<L>The noblest manners, and the happiest time."</L>

<HEAD>NOTES TO PART I.</HEAD>
<P>LINE 42. The parish of Greenfield consists of about thirteen square miles. On this little tract were found, at the time of the late census, al∣most fourteen hundred inhabitants: a population as great, as that of Britain, if the accounts which I have seen, of the extent and population of that country, are just. The people of Greenfield are almost all Farmers, and have no advantages for support, besides those which are common to N. England in general. Thus without any peculiar assistance from com∣merce, or manufacturing, an immense population can exist on the mere labours of the husbandman. The people of Greenfield, also, very generally abound in the necessaries and comforts of life. Such are the effects of an equal division of property, and of the cultivation of lands by the pro∣prietors.</P>
<P>L. 85. No country has been more unjustly or contemptibly slandered, than New England.</P>
<P>L. 94. [Firms.] I have ventured to use this word, as a verb. It appeared to me better to express the idea intended, than any other word, which I could recollect.</P>
<P>L. 177. A remarkable proof of the mildness of manners, in New Eng∣land, existed during the late war. The inhabitants were at least as much divided, and as directly opposed, both in opinion and conduct, as those of France; and through a much longer period. <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>January</HI> 1, 1793.</NOTE> Yet not one person was put to death by the hand of violence, and but one by the hand of civil justice, during an eight years war, and in a country containing a million of inhabitants.</P>
<P>L. 215. The State of Connecticut exhibits the most uniform and un∣mixed manners, to be found in New England; and those, which may, with the greatest propriety, be called the national manners of that country.</P>
<P>L. 223. The happiness of the inhabitants of Connecticut appears, like their manners, morals, and government, to exceed any thing, of which the Eastern continent could ever boast. A thorough and impartial deve∣lopement of the state of society, in Connecticut, and a complete investi∣gation of the sources of its happiness, would probably throw more light on the true methods of promoting the interests of mankind, than all the vo∣lumes of philosophy, which have been written. The causes, which have already produced happiness, will ever produce it. To facts alone, there∣fore,
<PB N="170" REF="026925_0156_0FD26646171B15B8"/> 
ought we to resort, if we would obtain this important knowledge. Theories are usually mere dreams; fitted to amuse, not to instruct; and Philosophers, at least political ones, are usually mere Theorists. The com∣mon sense of the early Colonists of New England saw farther into political subjects, those at least, which are of great importance to human happiness, than all the Philosophers, who have written since the world began.</P>
<P>L 225. Nothing can be more visionary, than many modern Philo∣sophic opinions, concerning government. All human systems, respecting practical subjects, unless derived from facts, will ever be visionary, and deserve to be cla<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed with substantial forms, subtil matter, and atomic ten∣dency to exertion. Man is wholly unable, by mere contemplation, to bring into his view a number of principles sufficient to constitute a theory, which can consist with practice. One would imagine, that the universal fate of hypothetical philosophy must long since have taught ingenious men this obvious truth; but the pleasure of making, and defending, systems, is so great, that such men are still employed in building air-castles, and in seri∣ously expecting to inhabit them.</P>
<P>L. 234. If gentlemen, who are natives of Europe, should think this paragraph harsh, or unfounded, the writer requests them so far to turn their attention to the several facts, mentioned in it, as to satisfy them∣selves, whether the ascription be just, or erroneous. The natives of Great Britain, particularly, will find, in distinguished writers of that country, descriptions of British society, warranting all, that is asserted in this poem: descriptions confirmed, so far, at least, as the author's acquaintance has extended, by those Americans, who have travelled into Britain. The <HI>Tus<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> one of the most sensible and valuable performances, in the English lan∣guage, is alone a sufficient justification of no small part of what is here declared.</P>
<P>L. 247. It is, perhaps, not to be wondered at, that the state of so∣ciety, lately existing in France, should be followed by extensive and ridi∣culous infidelity; but that such a speech as that said to be uttered, Dec. 1792, by Citizen Dupont, should have been spoken by any man, on any occasion, and before any audience, would hardly have been believed, unless published with high authentication. That it should have been uttered by a man, characterized as a man of weight and influence, is still more astonishing: and that it should have been received, by the Legislative As∣sembly of a great Nation, with applause, is a Tact, which▪ if it should, unhappily, for the honour of human nature, be banded to posterity, will probably be regarded rather as a Provencal legend, than as a reality. Of the like contemptible character are the later declarations of Citizen La∣croix, on the petition of the Quakers and Anabaptists; in which are the following words. "The Constitution is my Gospel, and Liberty is my God. I know no other" These gentlemen appear ambitious of ri∣valling the character of Aretine, on whose tomb this inscription is said to have been written.</P>
<LG>
<L>Here lies Aretine,</L>
<L>Who spoke evil of every one,</L>
<L>But his God;</L>
<L>And in this he must be excused,</L>
<L>Because he did not know him.</L>
</LG>
<P>L. 248. I have seen a memorial, said to be presented to his British Ma∣jesty, by the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council, of London;
<PB N="171" REF="026925_0157_0FD26629A85539D0"/>
in which they declare, that within ten years, 4,800 persons had, in that city, been convicted of felony. <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>In the Lent circuit</HI> (1786) 286 <HI>persons were capitally convicted in England; and from</HI> 960 <HI>to</HI> 1000 <HI>convicts are now annually transported from that country.</HI></NOTE> In New England, which contains more inhabitants than London, it is to be questioned, whether, in any ten years, since it was settled by the English, there have been ten persons convicted of felony. A partial account, for this enormous disproportion, may be found in the mildness of the laws of New England, which are far less san∣guinary, than those of Great Britain. It may also be justly observed, that London is a city of enormous wealth, and enormous poverty, and a ge∣neral receptacle of sharpers and villains from the whole British empire; as well as from several other countries. But it is also to be remembered, that a great proportion of the felons, convicted in New England, are natives of Europe. It is probable that the subject cannot be explained in any manner, which will not involve, as its principal causes, the very great difference, in the respective places, to be found in the universality of happiness, and in the purity of morals.</P>
<P>L. 267. [See every heart, &amp;c.] The fashions of Europe, especially of Britain and France, suit neither the climate, the convenience, the policy, the property▪ nor the character, of this country. The changes of climate in this country require modes of dressing very different from those, which are healthful in France and England. The Americans are generally people of business, and, of course, must be greatly and continually incommoded by an adoption of many foreign fashions. Our policy naturally teaches us to reject all servile imitation of the manners of other countries; and all constant imitation is attended with servility. The dignified character of free republicans ought to lead them to despise a perpetual change in the figure of dress; to-aim only at such modes as are convenient, and to per∣severe in them; to shew their independence, in the choice of their own modes, and their ingenuity in the invention of them; and to manifest a total superiority to the miserable frippery of artificial society. In the mean time, our pecuniary circumstances would be advantageously consulted, by the adoption of dress, in all respects such as might well consist with our general mediocrity of wealth. The Friends appear to shew much good sense on this subject.</P>
<P>L. 279. War has existed, in some, or other, of the countries of Europe, 75 years, out of the 92, which have elapsed, since the beginning of the present century; a century boasted of, as the most enlightened, refined, and humane, within the knowledge of mankind. The causes of these wars have; also; been generally such; as ought to cover the authors of them with deep and perpetual infamy.</P>
<P>L. 296. Few objects more demand the attention of men of influence, in this country, than the establishment of national manners. That much may be done, for this purpose, will not, I presume, be questioned, There are but two, or three countries, in the United States, in which the man∣ners have any thing like a general uniformity: the low country of Vir∣ginia, the low country of South Carolina, and New England. The man∣ners of Virginia and South Carolina cannot be easily continued, without the continuance of the Negro slavery; an event, which can scarcely be expected. The manners of New England appear to be rapidly spreading through the American republic; the natives of that country being generally
<PB N="172" REF="026925_0158_0FD2664762992D80"/>
even more tenacious of their manners, when abroad, than when at home. When the enterprize, industry, oeconomy, morals, and happiness, of New England, especially of Connecticut, are attentively considered, the patriotic mind will perhaps find much more reason to rejoice in this prospect, than to regret it.</P>
<P>L. 297. [Think whence this weal arose.] The peculiar prosperity of New England in general, and particularly of Massachusetts and Connecticut, undoubtedly arises from the equal division of property, the universal establishment of schools, and their peculiar manner of supporting the gospel.</P>

<HEAD>NOTES TO PART II.</HEAD>
<P>LINE 1. This part of the poem, though appropriated to the parish of Greenfield, may be considered as a general description of the towns and villages of New England; those only excepted, which are either commer∣cial, new, or situated on a barren soil. Morose and gloomy persons, and perhaps some others, may think the description too highly coloured. Per∣sons of moderation and candour may possibly think otherwise. In its full extent, the writer supposes it applicable to the best inhabitants only; but he believes the number of these to be great: to others he thinks it partially applicable. Poetical representations are usually esteemed flattering; pos∣sibly this is as little so, as most of them. The inhabitants of New Eng∣land, notwithstanding some modern instances of declension, are, at least in the Writer's opinion, a singular example of virtue and happiness.</P>
<P>It will be easily discovered by the reader, that this part of the poem is designed to illustrate the effects of the state of property, which is the coun∣ter part to that, so beautifully exhibited by Dr. Goldsmith, in the Deserted Village. That excellent writer, in a most interesting manner, displays the wretched condition of the many, where enormous wealth, splendour, and luxury, constitute the state of the few. In this imperfect attempt, the writer wished to exhibit the blessings, which flow from an equal division of property, and a general competence.</P>
<P>Wherever an <HI>equal division of property</HI> is mentioned, in the Work, the Reader is requested to remember, that that state of things only is intended, in which every citizen is secured in the avails of his industry and prudence, and in which property descends, by law, in equal shares, to the proprietor's children.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="026925_0159_0FD2662B23DA4C88"/>

<P>L. 12. [The spring bird.] A small bird, called, in some parts of New England, by that name; which appears, very early in the spring, on the banks of brooks and small rivers, and sings a very sweet and sprightly note.</P>
<P N="4">(4) L. 26. [Slump'd.] This word, said, in England, to be of North Country original, is customarily used in New England, to denote the sud∣den sinking of the foot in the earth, when partially thawn, as in the month of March. It is also used to denote the sudden sinking of the earth under the foot.</P>
<P>L. 28. [Nutwood.] Hickory.</P>

<P>L. 75. In several parts of this country, the reads through villages are called streets.</P>

<P>L. 154. By poverty's unconquerable bar. <HI>Beattic.</HI></P>
<P>L. 196. [Wain.] Waggon, or cart,</P>
<P>L. 208. Some interesting and respectable efforts have been made, in Connecticut, and other▪ are now making, for the purpose of freeing the Negroes.</P>
<P>L. 221. The black children are generally sprightly and ingenious, until they become conscious of their slavery. This usually happens, when they are 4, 5, or 6 years of age. From that time, they usually sink into stu∣pidity, or give themselves up to vice.</P>
<P>L. 237. If we consider how few inducements the blacks have to in∣genious, or worthy efforts, we shall more wonder, that there are, among them, so many, than that there are so few, examples of ingenuity or amiableness.</P>
<P>L. 244. [Essoins.] Excuses.</P>

If the authority here quoted, for these particular instances of cruelty, exercised on the unhappy Africans, in the West Indies, should be thought doubtful, the reader may find, in the evidence taken, on this subject, by the Committee of the British House of Commons, an immense number of instances, in which inhumanity, equally reprehensible, has been undoubtedly practised on these unhappy people.</P>

<P>L. 305. In some of the West India Islands, it is a custom, to send, on Monday morning especially, offending slaves to the docks; each carrying a billet, declaring the transgression, and the number of stripes the offender is to receive, and containing a pistareen to pay for the infliction of them.—There the offenders are raised up, successively, by a crane, and stretched by heavy weights, appended to their ancles In this posture, they are most cruelly tortured by the cowskin, and still more cruelly, it is said, by a briar, called ebony; which is used to let out the blood, where it has been started by the whip.</P>

All persons declare formal visiting to be unpleasing and burthen∣some, arm familiar visiting to be pleasing; yet multitudes spend no small part of their lives, in formal visiting, and consider themselves as being under a species of obligation to it.

<P>L. 617. I do not remember ever to have seen a lady, in full dress, who appeared to be so happy, or to behave so easily, and gracefully, as when she was moderately dressed. An unusual degree of dress seems uniformly to inspire formality, distance, and difficulty of behaviour. Toil, taste, and fancy, are put to exertion, to contrive, and to adjust, the dress, which is expected highly to ornament the person; and the same exertion, appears to be used in contriving, and fashioning, manners, which may become the dress.</P>

<HEAD>NOTES TO PART III.</HEAD>
<P>LINE 15. On the plain, on which Fairfield is built, are several eminences of uncommon beauty.</P>
<P>L. 115. There were several acts of gross abuse, and of savage barbarity, practised by the British, when they burned Fairfield.</P>
<P>L. 143. That inferiors, in subordination, are bound to obey all, even the unjust and immoral commands of their superiors, and that the inferior is; in this conduct, justifiable, and the superior alone guilty, is still not un∣frequently asserted, and therefore probably believed. When it shall be right to do evil, that good may come, when crimes and virtuous actions, with the guilt, and the merit, of them shall become transferable, when man shall cease to be accountable to his MAKER, and when GOD shall no more rule, with rightful authority, over his own creatures, this doctrine will probably rest on a more solid basis.</P>
<P>L. 181. None of the numerous and horrid evils of war is more wanton, more useless, and more indicative of the worst character, than burning. No nation, by which it is either allowed, or done, ought to make a claim to humanity, or civilization.</P>
<P>L. 231. There was a heavy thunder storm, on the night, in which Fairfield was burned; yet such was the confusion and distress of the re∣maining inhabitants, that several of them did not perceive it.</P>
<P>L. 168. From Fairfield, the British proceeded to Norwalk; which they burned, the next day. It deserves to be remembered, that, during the conflagration Governor Try on had a chair carried to the top of an eminence, in that town, called Grummon's h<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll; and there, at his ease, enjoyed the prospect, and the pleasure, of the scene. Two churches, 135 dwelling houses, with a proportional number of other buildings, were destroyed, at Norwalk. Eight other towns, in the United States, experienced the same fate; and while immense evil was done to the inhabitants, no benefit ac∣crued, as none plainly could accrue, to their enemies.</P>
<P>L. 365. It is probable, that more of human labour, ingenuity, and property has been expended in the various business of destruction, than in all the arts, by which peace and happiness have been promoted.</P>
<P>L. 405. Every person, acquainted with the history of the Romans, knows that the temple of Janus was shut, whenever they were in a state of peace, and that this happened but twice, during the first 750 years of their national existence. Mankind in general have been engaged in war, with almost as little intermission.</P>
<P>It would be worth the labour of some friend to mankind, to present the public with a complete view of the time, during which war has existed in Europe, since the destruction of the Roman empire; the number of nations concerned in each war; the sums expended; the debts incurred; the soldiers, sailors, and citizens, destroyed; the cities towns, and villages, burnt, plundered, and ruined; the miseries, known to be suffered; the most pro∣bable causes of the respective wars; and the gain resulting to the respective combatants. Those, who have access to large libraries would probably find, in them, much of the information, necessary to a design of this na∣ture.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="026925_0162_0FD2664CF8F008D8"/>
L. 487. The injury, done by war, to the morals of a country, is inferior to none of the evils, which it suffers. A century is insufficient to repair the moral waste of a short war.</P>
<P>L. 553. [Go then, ah go.] It is probable, that whenever mankind shall cease to make war, this most desirable event will arise from the general opposition, made to war, by the common voice. Hence the peculiar im∣portance of diffusing this opposition, as widely as possible, especially by education. If parents, school-masters, and clergymen, would unite their efforts, for this most benevolent and glorious purpose, the effects of such an union, on the rising generation, would probably exceed the most sanguine hopes.</P>
<P>L. 601. Some of the fixed stars are, from evident alterations in their appearance, called changeable stars. The star, Aegol, or Medusa's head, as a remarkable one; and changes, from the first, to the fourth magnitude.</P>
<P>L. 659. The custom of privateering is one of the reliques of Gothic barbarity. No good reason can be given, why commissions, to plunder and destroy houses, should not be given to private persons, as well as to plunder and destroy vessels; to rob on the land, as well as on the sea; and why such persons, as resisted, should not be put to death, in the one case, as well as in the other. Custom, it is presumed, is the only ground of any difference of opinion, with regard to the cases proposed. All privateering is robbery, and murder; and the government, which sanctions privateering, is guilty of authorizing these horrid crimes. Nor can the merchant, who is the proprietor, be excused from his share in the guilt.</P>

<P>L. 224. The Indians have generally supposed the future world of hap∣piness to lie in the western regions. The reason seems to be the same with that, which induces the Negroes to believe the happy world situated in Africa; <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that it was the country, whence they originated. A similar opinion appears to have existed among several, perhaps most, ignorant co∣lonists, for some time, after their emigration.</P>
<P>L. 269 [Sheen.] Brightness.</P>
<P>L. 298. [Elliot, Mayhew.] These excellent men have proved, beyond dispute, that the Indians may be civilized, and christianized, by proper efforts. Their Apostolic piety ought to be remembered, with perpetual honour, and well deserves a public monument, from the State, of which they were ornaments, as well as citizens.</P>
<P>L. 307. The greatest obstacle to christianizing the Indians is now, as it has usually been, their rivetted persuasion, that the British Colonists, in all their correspondence with them, have aimed at their own benefit, not at the benefit of the Indians; at the acquisition of their lands, not at the salvation of their souls: a persuasion founded on too unequivocal and shameful proof. So long as those, who trade with them, are allowed to poison them by all the means of corruption, virtuous men can only regret their miserable condition. It is to be hoped, that the late act of Congress, re∣gulating our correspondence with the Indians, together with several other humane and just measures of the same nature, measures which reflect the highest honour on that Body, will, in a good degree, remove these evils.</P>
<P>L. 311. [India's curse.] Rum.</P>
<P>L. 351. The French settlers of Canada took unceasing and immense pains, to induce the Indians to quarrel with the English Colonists. To this conduct they were influenced not less by religious motives, than by those of policy, and by what has been called national enmity.</P>
<P>L. 362. The hill, to which the Pequods retired, has the appearance of being artificial.</P>
<P>L. 394. The heroism, celebrated by Homer, Virgil, and other Greek and Latin Poets, principally consisted of feats of personal prowess, and the conduct of small parties. Such was the gallantry of the first American Colonists.</P>

<P>PREFATORY NOTE 1. THIS part of the poem, though designed, in a degree, for persons in most employments of life, is immediately addressed to Farmers. As almost all the inhabitants of Greenfield, and of New England, are farmers, it was supposed by the writer, that this circumstances naturally directed to such an address.</P>
<P>L. 63. [Lawrence.] A proverbial name, is some parts of New England, for a lazy person.</P>
<P>L. 148. [Fit the ground.] A customary phrase, in some parts of New England, to denote the preparatory cultivation of a field, which is to be sown.</P>
<P>L. 270. It is customary, in New England, when property is taken by distress, to advertise the sale of it upon a post, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for that purpose.</P>

L. 289. [The first of May.] The day, on which accounts are usually adjusted, and pecuniary obligations discharged, in the state of New-York.</P>
<P>L. 297. For more than twenty years, the writer of this poem has been employed in the business of education, and, in that time, has had, in a greater or less degree, the superintendence of almost a thousand young per∣sons, of both sexes. Almost all the sentiments here expressed, concerning the instruction, government, and habituation, of children, he has seen often proved to be just, through the whole course of this extensive expe∣rience. He is induced to these observations by a full, experimental con∣viction of the entirely theoretical and visionary nature of several modern opinions on the subject; opinions, published by men, of genius indeed, but wholly inexperienced in education; men who educate children on paper, as a geometrician circumnavigates the globe, in half a dozen spherical triangles. On some future occasion, he may, perhaps, take the liberty to offer to the public some further sentiments, on this copions and very inter∣esting subject. In the mean time, he believes, that these may be safely adopted by such, as have not acquired more extensive information, and for such only are they designed.</P>
<P>L. 447. No principle of action will usually be of any service to children, unless it be made habitual.</P>
<P>L. 451. I believe, that there are very few children, who might not be rendered amiable and worthy, if their parents would begin their efforts in season, and continue them steadily, without yielding to either sloth, or dis∣couragement.</P>
<P>L. 471. In most places in New England, the parish bell is rung, at 9 o'clock, in the evening: a custom, which has more influence in promoting good order, than a slight observer would imagine.</P>
<P>L. 531. There are many social libraries in Connecticut; and the num∣ber is fast increasing. This is visibly one of the best means of diffusing knowledge. If the proprietors of each would tax themselves a small such yearly, they would soon be able to procure a sufficient number of books, to answer every valuable purpose of such an institution.</P>
<P>L. 567. I once knew a farmer, who steadily did what was called a good day's-work, and yet employed several hours, every day, in reading.</P>
<P>L. 570. Several of the most useful and respectable men, in America, were privately educated; and some of them, with very small advantages.</P>
<P>L. 637. [A townsman.] In New England, the prudentials of each town are commonly placed under the direction of a small number of men, chosen for that purpose, and called indifferently selectmen or townsmen.</P>

<P>L. 113. 114. The Inconveniencies, arising from the extremes of heat and cold, in N. America, are abundantly compensated by the great variety and richness of its productions. The two harvests, of European grain, and Indian <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> (one of which is almost always a plentiful one) will probably hereafter, as they have done heretofore, ever forbid even a scarcity of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of life.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. The foundation of all equal liberty is the natural and equal descent of property to all the children of the proprietor. Republics cannot long exist, but upon this basis.</P>
<P>L. 145. A very unequal division of property appears ever to have had very baneful effects on the general happiness of mankind. A great part of the prosperity of Great Britain may be attributed to the inroads made by Henry VII. upon the entailment of estates.</P>

Since Blackstone wrote, Capel Loft estimates the number of felonies, without benefit of Clergy, at 176; and of felonies with Clergy, at 65.—Of those, who were executed, the Solicitor General declares, that 18 out of 20 do not exceed 20 years of age.</P>
<P>L. 386. It has not yet been proved, that the punishment of death can, with either jusstice, or policy, be inflicted for any other crime, beside murder. From the few experiments, which have been made, solitary confinement appears to be at much more effectual as it is more humane.</P>
<P>The present penal system of Pennsylvania well deserves the respect and the adoption of every Government.

<P>L. 401. It seems not a little surprising, that almost the whole business of distributive government should, hitherto, have been to punish.</P>
<P>L. 413-416. There is no country, in which law has a more decided, (and if I may be allowed the expression) despotic power, than in Connecticut.

In the sword of the cosstellation, Orion, there is a place, which appears like a window in the sky; through which the eye apparently penetrating sees, in telescopes of high powers, a more glorious region, than has been elsewhere discovered; a region in which perpetual day seems to shine with singular splendour.</P>

<P>A person of delicacy, and virtue, is naturally led to wonder, that a man of such talents, as Mr. Pope possessed, and entertaining the very just sen∣timents, expressed in these finished lines, should have written, published, and left to be handed down to posterity, a great number of verses, which he has actually: written, and published. In his Rape of the Look, there are several lines plainly indelicate, and some grossly obscene. In his Eloisa to Abelard, the sentiments are, in some instances, gross and noxious. Yet these are his first performances. His Moral Essays (particularly the second) trespass, at times, against truth, justice and decency. The same is too often true of his satires. The Dunciad is, in several places, a severer satire on the author, than on the objects of his resentment: not to mention several of his smaller imitations of other poets, and the hideous volume, published as a supplement to his acknowledged works.</P>
<P>No Writer ought ever to publish a sentiment, or expression (unless when some scientifical, or other important purpose necessitates it) which cannot be read, in a mixed company, of Ladies and Gentlemen, without giving pain to the most refined and delicate mind.</P>

<P><PB N="182" REF="026925_0168_0FD26655CBEF11A8"/>
The drummer of Mr. Addison offends, not unfrequently, against decency. There are also, in his other works, a few passages, which one could wish had been expunged. These facts are a proof of unhappy yielding to the taste of his times, in a man, who was an ornament to human nature.</P>
<P>L. 503. It is not a little injurious to the honour of human nature, that the elegant arts of Poetry, Painting, and Music, have, in Europe, been so often prostituted to the celebration of vile characters, to the display of sub∣jects and sentiments gross and pernicious, and to the commemoration of facts, which deeply stain the name of man.</P>
<P>L. 535. Infidel philosophers frequently impeach, and affect to despise, the evidence of testimony. Yet their own reasonings are generally attended with evidence, and most usually founded on evidence, which, in clearness and strength, is far inferior to that of testimony: a great part of their sen∣timents being mere and trifling hypotheses.</P>
<P>L. 565. Warton, in his Essay on the genius and writings of Pope, ob∣serves, that mediocrity is the situation, most favourable to the exertions of genius. It is also the situation, evidently most friendly to national, and individual, virtue and happiness.</P>
<P>L. 583. There is something singularly unhappy in the attempts of the Americans to imitate the burthensome ostentation of Europe. Americans are not, and probably will not soon be, sufficiently acquainted with the round of European form, and etiquette, to adopt it with either skill, or grace. At the same time, we have not, and, without entailments, never shall in any great number of instances have, wealth sufficient to support the necessary expense.</P>
<P>Common Sense, Philosophy, and Religion, alike condemn such manners, in every instance, and view them, as the painful efforts of folly to lift itself into respectability. The plain manners of Republicans, incomparably less burthensome, and more graceful and pleasing, are our own native manners: such manners, as made the Gaul esteem the Roman senate an assembly of gods; and the courtier Cineas consider the citizens of Rome, as a collection of kings.</P>
<P>Sensible travellers, whose manners are generally viewed as more finished, and pleasing, than any other, appear usually to acquire a contempt, and disuse, of ceremony, and to adopt a plainer behaviour, than most other men of breeding. A persevering adoption of plain manners, by men of influence, would give them a general and lasting sanction; and prove of more real benefit to the present, and future, inhabitants of America, than renowned victories, or immense acquisitions of territory.</P>
<P>It may, perhaps, be said, as it often has been said, though with neither discernment, nor truth, that parade is necessary to give energy to law, and dignity to government. It may be answered, that no laws have greater energy, and no government was ever more respected, than those of Con∣necticut have usually been, for more than 150 years. Yet in Connecticut, parade is unknown in practice, and despised by the universal opinion.—The truth is, people of mere common sense, and uneducated to ceremony, always despile it: it's introduction, therefore, is always owing to the vanity, and weakness, of men in superior stations, or ranks, of life.</P>
<P>L. 597. There is reason to believe, that the women, in New England, in all that renders the female character respectable, and lovely, are inferior to none, in the world. They blend the useful, and the pleasing, the refined, and the excellent, into a most delightful, and dignified union; and
