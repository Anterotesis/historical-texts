<HEAD>To their Excellencys, THE Lords Justices OF ENGLAND The Humble MEMORIAL of <HI>Chidley Brook</HI> &amp; <HI>William Nicolls,</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER>SHEWETH,</OPENER>
<P>THat they were sent from the Governour, Council and General Assembly of His Majesties Province of <HI>New-York</HI> about the Month of <HI>November</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, with an humble Address of Thanks to His Sacred Majesty, for his Royal Care of and Bounty to that Province, with all dutiful Acknowledgment of their hearty Affection and Zeal to His Majesty's Person and Government.</P>
<P>That they had also Commission and Instructions to lay before his Majesty the State and Condition of that Province, in relation to the War with the French; and further, to move and appear in any matter or thing that may conduce to the Good and Wellfare of that Province.</P>
<P>That being on heir Voyage hither, in the Month of <HI>January</HI> last, near the Islands of <HI>Silly,</HI> they were taken by a Privateer of <HI>St Malo,</HI> and carried into France, where they remained Prisoners till the beginning of the Month of <HI>April.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="039317_0002_10141D8F266F9D68"/>That when they found the Ship they were in was not capable of any longer Defence, they sunk all such Papers and Writings as did any ways concern the Publick or the War.</P>
<P>That they were instructed humbly to offer to and acquaint His Majesty, That the <HI>French</HI> of <HI>Canada</HI> have Re-settled a Fort at a place called <HI>Cadaraque,</HI> from whence they were driven by the Indians, the beginning of the War.</P>
<P>That since the said Settlement, the Indians of the five Nations have seemed much colder in their Friendship to the <HI>English,</HI> and it is to be feared, they will not only strike up a Peace with the <HI>French,</HI> but make open War upon the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>That it has not been possible for the Governour of <HI>New-York,</HI> with the Forces he has there, to hinder the settlement of the <HI>French</HI> at <HI>Cadaraque,</HI> it being scituate more than Five Hundred Miles from the uppermost Plantations, and the way thither through a Country of thick Woods and great Lakes, without any Road, and where no Provisions for any consider∣able Party of Christians are to be had.</P>
<P>That if those Five Nations of <HI>Indians</HI> should be drawn over to the <HI>French,</HI> all the English Plantations on the Main Land, that are settled at great distance from one another, will be liable to be wholly Ruined and Destroyed by small Parties of <HI>French</HI> and those <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>That the Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> by its Scituation, yearly Presents and Assistance given to those Indians, (to the great Impoverishing of that Country) has hitherto (except any Defection has happened since <HI>November</HI> last) with great diffi∣culty kept those <HI>Indians</HI> from quitting the <HI>English</HI> Interest.</P>
<P>That in that Province, consisting of about three Thousand Families, towards the defraying the Charge of the War, has been raised, since the year 1690. above 30000 <HI>l.</HI> and all the Assistance had from the Neighbouring Colonies, has only been about 3000 <HI>l.</HI> though all the <HI>English Plantations</HI> on the Continent are equally (if not more) concerned in the danger.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="039317_0003_10141D93B96AE210"/>That notwithstanding so much Money has been raised from that Province, and the other Assistance given by its Neighbours, the Expence of the War has been so great, that the Government at present remains much in debt, and will not be longer able to subsist, unless some effectual Methods are found to support it.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Indians</HI> being weary of the War, observing the great Recruits of Men, Arms and Stores yearly sent from <HI>France,</HI> are very sensible of the Danger threatned them by the Neighbourhood of the <HI>French</HI> in <HI>Cadaraque,</HI> who are much better fortified there than formerly; and by this they are inclined to hearken to the Proposals made from those of <HI>Canada,</HI> who by Menaces, Gifts, and other means, endeavour to get those <HI>Indians</HI> to engage on their side.</P>
<P>They humbly therefore pray Your Lordships to Intercede with His Majesty, To order some speedy and effectual Care to be taken, that the Evils, which apparently will attend the <HI>Indians</HI> Confederating with the <HI>French,</HI> and their settling in those Parts may be prevented.</P>
