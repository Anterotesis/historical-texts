<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR PARENTS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I CAN not resist the feelings which impel me to seize this first, and perhaps only, opportunity, of publicly testi∣fying to you my respect and affection.—To you I am indebted, not merely for life, but for instruction and example happily calculated to explain, and impress me with a sense of, its value, and the inestimable purposes to which it may be applied. If, in my past or future con∣duct, any conformity to your desires and precepts appear; if, by any past or future exertions of mine, the welfare of mankind be in any degree promoted; to your cares, to your vigilance, to your virtues, will it be owing. It is, therefore, a simple act of justice, to make my first ac∣knowledgments to you.—The panegyric of a poet, on his patron, may justly be suspected; but who will venture to question the sincerity of a son, who dedicates to his pa∣rents?—Nor need your modesty be wounded, by this pub∣lic mark of my esteem. Should my conduct prove me worthy to claim relation to you, it will best pronounce your eulogy: my follies and my vices can only affect myself.— Accept then, my dear parents, this new proof of my sin∣cere and filial love.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AN Author, of some reputation, has declared it as his opi∣nion, that every Preface should be historical; and explain, not only the design of the work it precedes, but the circumstances and motives which led to its composition. It would ill become me to controvert a doctrine so convenient for my present pur∣pose. Authors, it is true, are apt to measure the respect of others for their productions, by the estimation in which they are held by themselves. In this they may be, and often are, de∣ceived. Yet, perhaps, they do not greatly err, when they suppose the history of their performances would not be un∣pleasing to those who have thought the performances them∣selves worthy of their attention. Such an error, at least, is venial; and will, I hope, be pardoned by those who may deem the succeeding statement unnecessary.</P>
<P>The principal scenes of the following Drama were composed in March, 1791; as an exercise, to beguile the weariness of a short period of involuntary leisure; and without any view to theatrical representation. From that time, till the month of October, 1793, they lay neglected, and almost forgotten. An accident then bringing them to recollection, several short scenes were added, agreeable to my original design; and the whole adapted to the Stage. The piece was presented to the <HI>then</HI> Managers of The Old American Company, for their acceptance, the December following; but the peculiar situa∣tion of the Theatre prevented any attention to this application, till June, 1794; when, on a change in the management, it
<PB N="6" REF="032843_0005_0FF5B6A4150D09C0"/>
was accepted. An interval of six months, and a further ac∣quaintance with the Stage, had convinced me that the Piece might undergo alterations, with advantage. These were un∣dertaken, immediately: the loss of a comic character, which was now rejected, was supplied by two new scenes; addi∣tional songs were composed; and a Drama of two acts, in prose, was converted into the Opera, in its present form, in the course of the succeeding month. The inherent defects of the plan were such as could not be remedied, without bestow∣ing on the subject a degree of attention incompatible with pro∣fessional engagements; and which I, therefore, thought my∣self justified in withholding. But should this performance meet the same generous indulgence, in private, with which it was received, in public, I shall neither attempt to disarm Cri∣ticism of her severity, nor be ashamed of this feeble effort to contribute to the rational amusement of my fellow-citizens.</P>

<POSTSCRIPT>
<P><HI>P. S.</HI> It may not be improper to observe, (though the reader can scarcely be supposed uninformed, in this particular,) that the first, second, third, fifth and sixth songs, in the third Act of the following Drama, are from Goldsmith; and all, except the first, from the Ballad of "Edwin and Angelina." I have taken the liberty to make a slight alteration in the second, to accommodate it more perfectly to my purpose; and it will be obvious that, in the principal scene between Edwin and An∣gelina, I have availed myself of the sentiments, and, as far as possible, of the very expressions of the Author.</P>

<L>To seize, and to secure, it? Full of wiles,</L>
<L>When powerless; empowered, a gaunt hyaena,</L>

<L>'Twas man that bow'd, opprest, destroy'd me,</L>

<L>Captain, we love you.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIFRID.</SPEAKER>
<L>Nay, I know it well,</L>
<L>And now confide my story to your love.</L>
<L>—'Twas my most hapless lot my birth to gain</L>
<L>In the same city with Earl Ethelbert.</L>
<L>His sire, of the first rank, (as sure you know,)</L>
<L>Was wealthy; and reported generous.</L>
<L>I was of noble birth—but—poor.—While young,</L>
<L>Distinction proud was neither known nor felt:</L>
<L>Like passions, and resembling taste, were ours;</L>
<L>And in sweet friendship's bands united us.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDRED.</SPEAKER>
<L>And what could interrupt?—He did not dare—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIFRID.</SPEAKER>
<L>Observe!—To manhood now arriv'd, his sire</L>
<L>To France dismist him, hoping his improvement.</L>
<L>—O fatal error! thus alone to trust,</L>
<L>Remote from friends, in life's most dangerous prime,</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="032843_0018_0FF5B6CD1F7A2E88"/>Gay, inconsiderate, and warm-glowing youth!—</L>
<L>—'Twas there his passions gain'd the mastery;</L>
<L>And he, profuse of wealth, unaw'd by rule,</L>
<L>And ignorant of restraint; flatter'd, carest,</L>
<L>His every humour studied; all his wants,</L>
<L>His passions all, supplied; grew vain, debauch'd,</L>
<L>Selfish and mercenary, false and cruel.</L>
</SP>

</SP>
<SP>

<L>Give heed!—It so befel,</L>
<L>Himself far off, and rioting in joys,</L>
<L>His father died. Then, and not till then, he,</L>
<L>To receive, at once, estate and title,</L>
<L>From abroad, return'd.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EDRED.</SPEAKER>
<L>Splendidly, no doubt;</L>
<L>With dissolute and arrogant demeanor.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIFRID.</SPEAKER>
<L>Most true.—In place exalted, he no more</L>
<L>His former friend recogniz'd; now, indeed.</L>
<L>A simple husbandman, of manners plain.</L>
<L>Nor did neglect alone content his soul;</L>

<L>To struggle was but vain. His rank and power,</L>
<L>Banisht all hope, and might defy all strength.</L>

<L>Menac'd my death; when, (a delivering spirit,)</L>
<L>He came, with lightning speed—withering their powers.</L>
<L>Three fell beneath his hand; and, to the fourth,</L>
<L>Humbled, and full of promises, he gave</L>
<L>Life, freedom, and security.—Bleeding,</L>
<L>Nor conscious of my state, me he convey'd</L>
<L>To where attention dwelt; and only left,</L>
<L>When, in returned strength, vigorous he saw me.</L>
<L>But—O how!—how shall I relate the rest?</L>
