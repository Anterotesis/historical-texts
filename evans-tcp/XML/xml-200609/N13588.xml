<HEAD>CANTO I. <HI>The Capture.</HI></HEAD>
<L>OUR vessel now in all her pomp and pride,</L>
<L>AURORA nam'd, departing out the tide▪</L>
<L>'Twas thy deep stream, O Delaware▪ that bore</L>
<L>This pile intended for Eustatia's shore;</L>
<L>Bound to those isles where endless summer reigns,</L>
<L>Fair fruits, gay blossoms, and enameled plains;</L>
<L>Where sloping lawns the roving swain delight,</L>
<L>And the cool morn succeeds the breezy night;</L>
<L>Where each glad day a heaven unclouded brings,</L>
<L>And fragrant mountains teem with golden springs.</L>
<L>From Cape-Henlopen, with soft southern gales,</L>
<L>When morn emerg'd we spread our flowing sails; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>May</HI> 26, 1780.</NOTE></L>
<L>Then <HI>East-south-east</HI> we plough'd the briny way,</L>
<L>Close to the wind, departing from the bay.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="017159_0003_0FA06DD75A152F60" MS="y"/><HI>Hermes</HI> and <HI>Mars</HI> stood pensive on the strand,</L>
<L>And Jove with pity saw <HI>us</HI> leave the land;</L>
<L>To think what ills we wrethed mortals bear,</L>
<L>How vain our labours and how vain our care.</L>
<L>The gale increases as we plough the deep,</L>
<L>Now scarce we see the distant mountains peep;</L>
<L>At last they sink beneath the rolling wave,</L>
<L>That seems their summits as they sink to lave.</L>
<L>Gay Phoebus now the sacred source of light,</L>
<L>Had pass'd the line of his meridian height;</L>
<L>And westward hung,—absconded from our view,</L>
<L>The shores were fled and every hill withdrew;</L>
<L>When ever cautious of some neighb'ring foe,</L>
<L>Aloft the captain bade a sailor go,</L>
<L>To mark if from the mast's aspiring height,</L>
<L>Through all the round, a vessel came in sight.</L>
<L>Soon did the seaman's quick discerning eye,</L>
<L>Far distant in the east a ship espy;</L>
<L>Her lofty masts stood bending to the gale,</L>
<L><HI>Close to the wind</HI> was brac'd each shivering sail;</L>
<L>Next from the deck we saw the approaching foe,</L>
<L>Her spangled bottom seem'd in flames to glow;</L>
<L>When to the winds she bow'd in dreadful haste,</L>
<L>And her lee guns lay delug'd in the waste;</L>
<L>At her top gallant that proud flag we saw,</L>
<L>Which once aspir'd to give the nations law;</L>
<L>But humbled now—with grief, regret and pain,—</L>
<L>No longer holds the empire of the main.</L>
<L>The frigate now had every sail unfurl'd,</L>
<L>And rush'd tremendous o'er the wat'ry world;</L>
<L>Fixt and resolv'd our ship to overtake,</L>
<L>With toil immense she strove to gain our wake;</L>
<L>Nor strove in vain,—the master gave command,</L>
<L>We tack'd about and try'd to gain the land;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="017159_0004_0FA06DD84C0CAFB0"/>As from the south the fresh'ning breezes rise,</L>
<L>Swift from her foe alarm'd Aurora flies;</L>
<L>With all her sails expanded to the wind,</L>
<L>She fled the unequal force that chac'd behind;</L>
<L>Along her decks dispos'd in close array,</L>
<L>Each at its port, the grim artillery lay;</L>
<L>Soon on the foe with brazen throat to roar,</L>
<L>But small their size and narrow was their <HI>bore</HI>;</L>
<L>Yet faithful they their destin'd stations keep,</L>
<L>To guard the barque that bears them o'er the deep;</L>
<L>Who now must bend to steer a wary course,</L>
<L>And trust her swiftness rather than her force▪</L>
<L>Still o'er the wave with foaming prow she flies,</L>
<L>And steady winds from equinoctial skies;</L>
<L>High in the air the <HI>starry streamer</HI> plays,</L>
<L>And every sail its various tribute pays;</L>
<L>To gain the land she bore the mighty blast,</L>
<L>And now the wish'd for Cape appear'd at last;</L>
<L>But the vext foe pursu'd us on our way,</L>
<L>Like a starv'd lion, hungry for his prey;</L>
<L>A frigate she and not unknown to fame,</L>
<L>For soon we learnt her nation and her name;</L>
<L>Iris it was— but Hancock once she bore,</L>
<L>Fram'd and completed on new Albion's shore;</L>
<L>By Manly lost—the swiftest of the train,</L>
<L>That fly with wings of canvas o'er the main.</L>
<L>Toward the land by favouring breezes led,</L>
<L>As Iris follow'd still Aurora fled;</L>
<L>(So fierce Pelides, eager to destroy,</L>
<L>Chac'd the proud trojan round the walls of Troy;)</L>
<L>Swift o'er the waves indignant they pursue,</L>
<L>As swiftly from their sangs Aurora flew;</L>
<L>At last the cape with joy we gain'd once more,</L>
<L>And here we strove to run the ship on shore.</L>
<L>But sate deny'd the barren shore to gain,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="017159_0005_0FA06DD91A567650"/>Denial sad and source of future pain!—</L>
<L>For then the inspiring breezes ceas'd to blow,</L>
<L>Lost were they all and calm the seas below;</L>
<L>(The cape dispell'd the breezes from our sails,</L>
<L>Though farther off a lively breeze prevails;)</L>
<L>Our ship unable to pursue her way,</L>
<L>Tumbling about, at her own guidance lay;</L>
<L>But Iris still kept farther off to sea,</L>
<L>And lay with dreadful aspect on our <HI>lee;</HI></L>
<L>Then up she <HI>luff'd</HI> and blaz'd her entrails dire,</L>
<L>Bearing destruction, terror, death, and sire.</L>
<L>Vext at our doom we prim'd a <HI>piece,</HI> and then</L>
<L>Return'd the shot to shew them we were men.</L>
<L>Dull night had now her dusky pinions spread,</L>
<L>And ev'ry hope to 'scape the foe was fled;</L>
<L>Close to thy cape, Henlopen, though we press'd,</L>
<L>We could not gain thy desart dreary breast;</L>
<L>Tho' ruin'd pines beshroud thy barren shore,</L>
<L>With mounds of sand half hid or cover'd o'er;</L>
<L>Tho' howling winds disturb thy summit bare,</L>
<L>Yet every hope and ev'ry wish was there.—</L>
<L>In vain we sought to gain the joyless strand,</L>
<L>Fate stood between and barr'd us from the land.</L>
<L>All dead becalm'd and lifeless as we lay,</L>
<L>The ebbing current forc'd us off to sea;</L>
<L>While vengeful Iris thirsting for our blood,</L>
<L>Flash'd her red lightnings o'er the trembling flood;</L>
<L>At every flash a storm of ruin came,</L>
<L>'Till now Aurora shook thro' all her frame:</L>
<L>Mad for revenge our breasts with fury glow,</L>
<L>To wreak returns of vengeance on the foe▪</L>
<L>Full at his hull our pointed guns we rais'd,</L>
<L>His hull resounded as the cannon blaz'd;</L>
<L>Through his fortopsail one a passage tore,</L>
<L>His sides re-echo'd to the dreadful roar;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="017159_0006_0FA06DDA14B9ADE8"/>Alternate sires dispell'd the shades of night—</L>
<L>But how unequal was this daring fight!</L>
<L>Our stoutest guns threw but a six-pound ball,—</L>
<L>Twelve-pounders from the foe our sides did maul;</L>
<L>And while no <HI>power</HI> to save him, intervenes</L>
<L>A bullet struck our <HI>captain of marines;</HI></L>
<L>Fierce, though he bid defiance to the foe,</L>
<L>He felt his death and ruin in the blow;</L>
<L>Headlong he fell distracted with the wound,</L>
<L>The deck bestain'd with heart-blood streaming round.</L>
<L>Now frequent cries throughout the ship resound,</L>
<L>And every bullet brought a different wound;</L>
<L>'Twixt wind and water one assail'd the side,—</L>
<L>Through this aperture rush'd the briny tide:</L>
<L>'Twas then <HI>Aurora</HI> trembled for her crew,</L>
<L>And bade thy shores O Delaware, adieu!—</L>
<L>And must <HI>she</HI> yield to yon' destructive ball,</L>
<L>And must our <HI>colours</HI> to these ruffians fall?</L>
<L>They fall—not waiting for another blow,</L>
<L>We strike at once to the relentless foe;</L>
<L>Convey'd to York, the Britons lodg'd us there,</L>
<L>Safe in their dens of hunger and despair; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>June</HI> 1, 1780.</NOTE></L>

<HEAD>CANTO II. The PRISON-SHIP.</HEAD>
<L>THE various horrors of these hulks to tell,</L>
<L>These Prison-Ships where pain and sorrow dwell;</L>
<L>Where death in tenfold vengeance holds his reign,</L>
<L>And injur'd ghosts, in reason's ear complain;</L>
<L>This be my task—ungenerous Britons you,</L>
<L>Conspire to murder those you can't subdue;</L>
<L>Why else no art of cruelty untry'd,—</L>
<L>Such heavy vengeance and such hellish pride?—</L>
<L>Death has no charms—his empires barren ly,—</L>
<L>A desart country and a clouded sky;—</L>
<L>Death has no charms except in British eyes,—</L>
<L>See how they court the bleeding sacrifice!</L>
<L>See, how they pant to stain the world with gore,</L>
<L>And millions murdered, still would murder more;</L>
<L>This selfish race from all the world disjoin'd,</L>
<L>Eternal discord sow among mankind;</L>
<L>Aim to extend their empire o'er the ball,</L>
<L>Subject, destroy, absorb and conquer all;</L>
<L>As if the power that form'd us did condemn</L>
<L>All other nations to be slaves to them;—</L>
<L>"A generous nation"—is their endless cry,</L>
<L>But truth revolts against the daring lie;</L>
<L>Compassion shuns them, an unwelcome guest,</L>
<L>They to humanity are foes profest;</L>
<L>In their dark bosoms pity claims no share,</L>
<L>For God in anger never plac'd it there:</L>
<L>A brutal courage is their ruling pride,</L>
<L>For one short hour of fame have thousands dy'd;</L>
<L>All nations they abhor, detest, decry,</L>
<L>But their dear race emblazon to the sky;</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="017159_0008_0FA06DDED78A13C8"/>As if the sun for Britain only shone,</L>

<L>To future years their bloody deeds prolong,</L>
<L>And hang them up to infamy in song.</L>
<L>So much I suffer'd, from the race I hate,</L>
<L>So near they shov'd me to the brink of fate;</L>

<L>To black oblivion that wou'd cover all;</L>
<L>Not unreveng'd shall all the woes we bore,</L>
<L>Be swallow'd up inglorious as before:</L>
<L>The dreadful secrets of these prison caves,</L>
<L>Half sunk, half floating on <HI>my Hudson</HI>'s waves;</L>
<L>The muse shall tell nor shall her voice be vain,</L>
<L>Mankind must shrink with horror at the strain;</L>
<L>To such a race the rights of men deny,</L>
<L>And blame the tardy vengeance of the sky.</L>
<L>See with what pangs yon' wasted <HI>victim</HI> dies,</L>
<L>With not a friend to close his languid eyes!—</L>
<L>He late, perhaps too eager for the fray,</L>
<L>Chas'd the vile Briton o'er the watry way;</L>
<L>Or close array'd—a stranger to all fear,—</L>
<L>Hurl'd the loud thunder from his privateer.</L>
<L>Thus do our warriors, thus our heroes fall,</L>
<L>Imprison'd here quick ruin meets them all;</L>
<L>Or sent afar to Britain's barbarous shore,</L>
<L>There die neglected and return no more.—</L>
<L>Ah, when shall quiet to my soul return,</L>
<L>And anguish in this bosom cease to burn;—</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="017159_0009_0FA06DE61384FA90"/>What frequent deaths in midnight vision rise!</L>
<L>(Once real) now all ghastly to my eyes,</L>

<L>The putrid water felt its powerful aid;</L>
<L>But when deny'd—to aggravate our pains,—</L>
<L>Then fevers rag'd and revel'd through our veins;—</L>
<L>Throughout my frame I felt its deadly heat,</L>
<L>I felt my pulse with quicker motions beat;</L>
<L>A ghastly paleness o'er my face was spread,</L>
<L>Unusual pains attack my fainting head;—</L>
<L>No physic here—no doctor to assist,—</L>
<L>My name was enter'd on the sick man's list;—</L>
<L>Twelve wretches more the-self same symptoms took,</L>
<L>And these were enter'd on the doctor's book;</L>
<L>The loathsome <HI>Hunter</HI> was our destin'd place,</L>
<L>The Hunter to all hospitals disgrace;</L>
<L>With soldiers sent to guard us on our road,</L>
<L>Joyful we left the Scorpion's dire abode;</L>
<L>Some tears we shed for the remaining crew,</L>

<HEAD>CANTO IV. The HOSPITAL-PRISON SHIP.</HEAD>
<L>NOW tow'rd the <HI>Hunter</HI>'s black abode we came,</L>
<L>A slaughter house, yet hospital in name;</L>
<L>For none came there (to pass thro' all degrees)</L>
<L>Till half consum'd and dying with disease;—</L>
<L>But when too near with labouring oars we ply'd,</L>
<L>The mate with curses drove us from the side;</L>
<L>Ten thousand times to irritate our woe,</L>
<L>He wish'd us founder'd in the gulph below;</L>
<L>Ten thousand times he brandish'd high his stick,</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="017159_0015_0FA06DE325376F70" MS="y"/>And swore as often that we▪ were not sick;—</L>
<L>—And yet so pale—that we were thought by some▪</L>
<L>A freight of ghosts from death's dominions come;—</L>
<L>But calm'd at length, for who can always rage,</L>
<L>Or the fierce war of endless passion wage;</L>
<L>He pointed to the <HI>stairs</HI> that led below,</L>
<L>To damps, disease and varied shapes of woe;—</L>
<L>Down to the gloom we took our pensive way,</L>
<L>Along the deck the dying captives lay;</L>
<L>Some struck with madness, some with scurvy pain'd,</L>
<L>But still of <HI>putrid fevers</HI> most complain'd;</L>
<L>On the hard floors these wasted objects laid,</L>
<L>There toss'd and tumbled in the dismal shade;</L>
<L>Of leaky decks I heard them much complain,</L>
<L>Drown'd as they were in deluges of rain;</L>
<L>Deny'd the comforts of a dying bed,</L>
<L>And not a pillow to support the head;</L>
<L>How could they else but pine and grieve and sigh,</L>
<L>Detest a wretched life and wish to die!</L>
<L>Soon as I came to this detested place,</L>
<L>A wasted <HI>phantom</HI> star'd me in the face;</L>
<L>"And art thou come (death heavy on his eyes)</L>
<L>And art thou come to these abodes, he cries;</L>
<L>Why didst thou leave the <HI>Scorpion</HI>'s dark retreat,</L>
<L>And hither come, a surer death to meet;</L>
<L>Why didst thou leave thy damp infected cell,</L>
<L>If <HI>that</HI> was purgatory, <HI>this</HI> is hell;</L>

<L>Gave his last groan and yielded his last breath▪</L>
<L>A Hessian <HI>Doctor</HI> from <HI>Long-Island</HI> came,</L>
<L>Not great his skill nor greater much his fame;</L>
<L>Fair <HI>science</HI> never call'd the wretch her <HI>son,</HI></L>
<L>And <HI>art</HI> disdain'd the stupid man to own:—</L>
<L>Can you admire why science was so coy,</L>
<L>Or art refus'd his genius to employ?—</L>
<L>On rocky hills can Eden's blossoms blow?</L>
<L>Do <HI>Trees of God</HI> in barren desarts grow,</L>
<L>Are loaded vines to <HI>Aetna</HI>'s summit known;</L>
<L>Or swells the <HI>peach</HI> beneath the frozen Zone?—</L>
<L>Yet still he puts his genius to the rack,</L>

<L>He on his charge the healing work begun,</L>

<L><HI>Ten minutes</HI> was the <HI>time</HI> he deign'd to stay,</L>
<L>The <HI>time of grace</HI> allotted once a-day;</L>
<L>He drencht us well with bitter draughts I know,</L>
<L>Peruvian Barks and Cremor-Tartar too;</L>
<L>On those refusing he bestow'd a kick,</L>

<L>Hence came our deaths: by his defective skill,</L>
<L>By sending, one, another's purge or pill;</L>
<L>By frequent blows we from his cane endur'd,</L>
<L>He kill'd at least as many as he cur'd:</L>
<L>Some did not seem obedient to his will,</L>
<L>And swore he mingled poison with his pill;—</L>
<L>But I acquit him by a fair confession,</L>
<L>He was no Englishman, he was a Hessian;—</L>
<L>Although a dunce he had some sense of sin,</L>
<L>Or else the Lord knows where we now had been;</L>
<L>Doubtless in that far country sent to range,</L>
<L>Where never prisoner meets with an exchange;—</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="017159_0017_0FA06DE490736148"/>Then had we all been banish'd out of time,</L>
<L>Nor I return'd to plague the world with rhime!</L>
<L>Our doctor had a master, chief physician,</L>
<L>To all the hospitals in their possession;</L>
<L>Once and but once by some strange fortune led,</L>
<L>He came to see the dying and the dead;</L>
<L>He came—but anger so deform'd his eye,</L>
<L>And such a faulchion glitter'd on his thigh;</L>
<L>And such a gloom his visage darken'd o'er,</L>
<L>And two such pistols in his hands he bore;—</L>
<L>That <HI>by the Gods</HI>—with such a load of steel,</L>
<L>He came, we thought to murder, not to heal;</L>
<L>Had he so dar'd—but fate with-held his hand,—</L>
<L>He came—blasphem'd—and turn'd again to land.</L>
<L>From this poor vessel and her sickly crew,</L>
<L>An English ruffian all his titles drew;</L>
<L><HI>Captain, esquire,</HI> commander too in chief,</L>
<L>And hence he gain'd his <HI>bread</HI> and hence his <HI>beef;</HI>—</L>
<L>But, sir, you might have searcht creation round,</L>
<L>'Ere such another devil could be found;</L>
<L>Tho' unprovok'd, an angry face he bore,</L>
<L>We stood astonish'd at the oaths he swore;</L>
<L>He swore—till every mortal stood aghast,</L>
<L>And thought him Satan in a brimstone blast;</L>
<L>He wish'd us banish'd from the public light,</L>
<L>He wish'd us bury'd in eternal night;</L>
<L>That were <HI>he</HI> king, no mercy would he show,</L>
<L>But drive all rebels to the <HI>world below;</HI></L>
<L>That if we scoundrels did not scrub the decks,</L>
<L>His staff should break our damn'd rebellious necks;</L>
<L>He swore besides, not waiting for his turn,</L>
<L>That if the ship took fire, we too should burn;</L>
<L>And meant it so—this monster I engage,</L>
<L>Had lost his post to gratify his rage.—</L>

<L>The vengeance from our injur'd country due,</L>
<L>To him and all the base unmanly crew.</L>

<L>These all in freedom's sacred cause ally'd,</L>

<L>Americans, a just resentment show,</L>

<L>Must York forever see your sons expire,</L>
<L>In ships, in prisons and in dungeons dire;</L>
<L>How long shall foes that trading city keep,</L>

<L>Unjust supporters of a tyrant's claim;</L>
<L>Foes to the rights of freedom and of men,</L>
<L>Stain'd with the blood of thousands you have slain▪</L>
<L>To the just doom the righteous skies decree,</L>

<L>That hour, great, chief had she been thine,</L>
