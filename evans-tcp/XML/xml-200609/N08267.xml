<HEAD>THE AUTHOR's PREFACE TO THE PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>THE following local piece, intitled, (<HI>The Disap∣pointment, or the Force of Credulity</HI>) was ori∣ginally wrote for my own, and the amusement of a few particular friends, who (unknown to me) were pleased to signify their approbation of it, in such a manner, that it soon engrossed the chief part of the conversation of all ranks of people; who expressed their desire to hear it, and have it published.—Under these circum∣stances, I was greatly at a loss how to proceed, I did not choose (as I saw no merit in it) to expose it to the criticisms of criticks, to put it in the pow∣er of gentlemen skill'd in scholastick knowledge, to ri∣dicule my ignorance, or condescend to the intreaties of those, who I thought had no more sense than myself, and who might (perhaps) have made it better than it really is. Conscious therefore of my own inability, I deter∣mined to excuse myself to all; and in this determination I persisted for some time, but at last, for my own safety, was obliged to capitulate and surrender on the follow∣ing stipulations; First, the infrequency of dramatic com∣positions in America: Secondly, the torrent of solicita∣tions from all quarters: Thirdly, the necessity of con∣tributing to the entertainment of the city: Fourthly and lastly, to put a stop (if possible) to the foolish and pernicious practice of searching after supposed hidden

treasure.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Many people to this day, are possessed with an idle notion, of the pyrate's burying money up or down the river side; and are so infatuated with the hopes of obtaining it, that they neglect their business by day with the thoughts of it; by which thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> families suffer, and at night, like so many mischievous muskrats, spoil the pastures and banks along shore▪ to the very great annoyance of their industrious neighbours.—Quere, Is not this insufferable? —And ought not these injured people to petition for an act, intitled, An act, to prevent this unconstitutional digging act, from being any longer in force as an act, with a heavy fine on those two legged muskrats: and should they refuse, or be incapable of pay∣ing it, that they should be deprived of what is most valuable in a muskrat, to be sold for the benefit of the sufferers?</NOTE> These terms, hard as they are, I have with reluctance been forced to submit to, I am therefore obliged in vindication of my conduct, to assure the public that the story is sounded on matter of fact, trans∣acted ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> this city, not long since, and recent in the memory of thousands; for the truth of which assertion I appeal to numbers of my fellow citizens. But in order to give strangers, and those unacquainted with the story some Idea of it, the following short history is thought necessary— The scheme was planned by four humorous gentlemen, Hum, Parchment, Quadrant, and Rattle∣trap, to divert themselves and friends▪ and try what lengths credulity and the love of money would carry men. In order to put their scheme into execution, they fram'd a plausible, well connected story of hidden treasure; and to gloss the matter, adapted sundry papers to their purpose, and pitch'd upon two suitable old fellows, Washball and Raccoon (as principle dupes) with others, to try the success of their scheme; which had the de∣sired effect.— The moral shews the folly of an over credulity and desire of money, and how apt men are (especially old men) to be unwarily drawn into schemes where there is but the least shadow of gain; and concludes with these observations, that mankind ought to be con∣tented with their respective stations; to follow their vo∣cations with honesty and industry— the only sure way to gain riches.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="010554_0004_0F8091891BEDC7C0"/>I do not figure to myself the least advantage ac∣cruing from it, but the inward satisfaction of con∣tributing my mite to stop the current of such folly. Such as it is, I submit to the public for their sanction or condemnation, and if any merit should appear in the performance, I shall not vainly attribute it to myself, but give the credit of it to meer chance.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<L>THO' distant far, from fam'd Britania's isle,</L>
<L>Where comic-scenes, call cynics forth to smile;</L>
<L>Our artless muse, hath made her first essay</L>
<L>T' instrust and please you with a modern play.</L>
<L>Theatric-bus'ness was, and still shou'd be,</L>
<L>To point out vice in its deformity;</L>
<L>Make virtue fair! shine eminently bright,</L>
<L>Rapture the breast and captivate the fight.</L>
<L>No matter which, the pulpit or the stage,</L>
<L>Condemn the vice and folly of the age;</L>
<L>These are our boast, and on sure ground we stand,</L>
<L>Plead virtues cause throughout this infant land;</L>
<L>We mount the stage, and lend an helping hand.</L>
<L>Wits, fools, a knave and conjurer to night,</L>
<L>The objects make both of your ears and sight.</L>
<L>A band of dupes are humm'd with idle schemes,</L>
<L>Quit solid sense for airy golden dreams.</L>
<L>Our flatt'ring muse thinks she's some merit gain'd,</L>
<L>Pursuing truth, and things (like truth) well feign'd.</L>
<L>The subject's suited to our present times,</L>
<L>No person's touch'd, altho' she lash their crimes;</L>
<L>Nor gall or copp'ras tincture her design,</L>
<L>But gay good humour breathe in ev'ry line.</L>
<L>If you condemn her—she for censure stands;</L>
<L>But if applaud— then thund'ring clap your hands.</L>

Well gen∣tlemen! How goes our scheme? Have you made any new proselytes since our last meeting?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hum.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, really, while credulity and the love of money prevail, I think it no merit to make proselytes of one half the town: but that you know is not our purpose; we only want to draw in four or five. I baited the hook for the old shaver; he gap'd▪ snapp'd and swallow'd it as voraciously as a cringing cour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> would a pension. As for Raccoon, I just threw out a few hints; he soon discovered the foundation, and rais'd the fabric himself.</P>

<P>I've hitherto kept him in suspence; he haunts me like a ghost; he thinks something, but knows no∣thing: He'll be here presently, and I have contriv'd matters so, that he shall make the discovery himself.</P>

<P>So far we have sail'd before the wind, and I've not been idle, for I've drawn in Trushoop and M' Snip: they've been with me these three nights, consulting proper measures for obtaining the treasure; and are so elevated, that I'm afraid they'll run crazy. He, he, he. Trushoop talks of building a chapel at his own expence, and employing a score of priests, to keep up a continual rotation of prayers for the repose of the souls of those poor fellows who buried it. As for M' Snip, he intends to knock off business, home to England and purchase a title. He, he, he. They'll both be here in half an hour.</P>
