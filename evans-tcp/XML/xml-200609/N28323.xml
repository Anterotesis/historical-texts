The poor old woman must be very cold!—'Tis well that these nocturnal walks will soon be at an end!—I have indeed promised poor Ellfield to see him again to-night, and I dare not go alone. Yet why not?—What need I fear in so short a distance?—What accident can happen to me?—Well, well, in a few days all will be revealed▪ Mrs. Ellfield recovers fast, and by Mor∣land's birth-day I hope will be in perfect health.—What pleasure shall I feel in presenting these unfortunate people to him upon that joyful occasion, and saying,
<Q>Dear husband I have preserved the lives of a worthy pair by the savings of my frugality; I have rescued the husband from want, the wife from sickness,—accept this offering as a birth-day tribute!</Q>
— And must the story be disclosed?—ah, I feel that the enjoyment of a good action is annihilated the moment that action becomes known: if another praise thee,—there is an end of thy reward;
<PB N="4" REF="037751_0004_100F0097C0772BD0"/>
but is thy own heart thy sole confidant,—new transport always arises from the recollection!—Morland, therefore, shall know all. Ah, could he foresee that a still more important discovery awaits him!—Thanks to Heaven! I can no longer doubt of the joyful event!—but this happy communication shall also be deferred till his birth day.</P>

<P>Do you suppose—</P>

<SPEAKER>Jenny</SPEAKER>
<P>Can I never hear the story often enough?—Evening after evening do I sit with you, my brother begins to read, my sister to work; but scarcely has the one read a half dozen sen∣tences, or the other set in half a dozen stitches, before a dead stop is made; and the blank in the narrative filled up with a long parenthesis of caresses, and "<HI>my dears,</HI>" and "<HI>my loves,</HI>" till I am tired of the repetition.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Emilia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you not recollect, that G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ethe says,

<P>The one sighs, "Ah, sister I am so happy!"—
"Bro∣ther I have heard that about a thousand times."

<P>Well, here I am!—Good-morrow, dearest Emilia!— and now, Jenny, what's the matter?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because we seldom lavish our affection upon brute animals, but from the want of more interesting objects.—Have you not often made this remark yourself?</P>

<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I</HI> make excuses for you!—by no means!—that you have, for a long time, sat in your study whole days together, and lately even slept there, that you might be up earlier in the morn∣ing to renew your labours, I well know;—But what you are about—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Morland.</SPEAKER>
<P>You cannot tell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Even so!—Often, when we have questioned you upon this subject, you have answered with the air of an ancient Ro∣man;
<Q>My dear girls, the welfare of the whole state rests upon my shoulders!</Q>
—Well, then, hasten to complete the important task in which you are engaged, that you may be restored to our society.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Morland.</SPEAKER>
<P>To accomplish that restoration, I must still work. Never was it more necessary to take example from the watch∣ful crane, whose figure crowns the arms over our city gates. On one side, too much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> required, on the other too much refused!— The prince is di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul, the people presuming, and neither party can enjoy a moment's repose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny</SPEAKER>
<P>But with us, God be thanked, all is quiet!—Aetna sends forth torrents of fire—the earth trembles—and we calmly read the dread tidings in the news-papers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Morland.</SPEAKER>
<P>When the earth shakes in Sicily, a new island is sometimes thrown up in the sea of Iceland. Heaven be prais∣ed! we are quiet at present, and my nightly watchings will, I hope, contribute towards increasing our security. It is no light task, to search the archives of a town for a succession of six cen∣turies, to separate rights from customs, and claims from laws, and then to compress the result into such a form that the Prince may know enough, without the people knowing too much.</P>

<P>Will not your talk be soon finished? We have en∣joyed so little of your company for a month past—</P>

<P>How happy is it for me that I obeyed the dictates of my reason, instead of yielding to the ambitious views of my aunt, with her numerous line of ancestors?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis happy, indeed, since all has fallen out so well! yet I must own, dear sister, that I was strongly averse to this match; as it did not, in my opinion, wear an auspicious aspect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emilia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Had you fully known the principles that decided my resolution—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>I had earnestly wished the union!—I had shewn that I was not insensible to the value of a woman whose innocence was so lightly estimated by a base aunt, yet who had virtue enough to prefer becoming the wife of a worthy citizen, to being the mistress of a prince.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Silence!—not so loud!</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>But then, indeed, my expectations would have been

raised to such a pitch, that I should not, as now, have seen you, for two years soaring so far above them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emilia.</SPEAKER>
<P>This testimony, dearest sister, is my pride, and my joy; and, believe me, I would, this day, do from enthusiastic af∣fection, what was then only the result of reason.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Singular enough for a woman to fall in love with her own husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emilia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not <HI>singular</HI> surely;—and is it not far better than to idolize the lover at the expence of the husband? I would seriously advise you, Jenny, to follow my example, not to wait for the witchery of love, but to be content with reason and friendship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Again casting a reflection upon my respectable spinster state? any one would suppose me as much surrounded with suit∣ors, as formerly the rich princess of Burgundy.</P>

<P>There is the gentleman of the Privy-Chamber—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> zephyr, that plays with every flower—a blighting insect that destroys every leaf he comes near. His tongue levels with the dust every respectable name, as the scythe mows down every blade of grass. I lately, however, very coolly and drily, told him such plain truths, that his hopes must now be entirely at an end.</P>

<P>Do not laugh, and I will tell you a truly feminine observation I have made. He wears very fine linen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>To which I can add another equally curious. Not long since a man came to this town, who gives himself out as an English master of languages. Smith calls him his friend and fellow countryman. But I, one day saw them together upon the stairs, when Smith had his hat on, and the other, with his in his hand was bowing to him very respectfully. This struck me, and I stopped to observe them; but they immediately perceived me, appeared embarrassed, and the tone of equality was instantly resumed, though evidently with some degree of restraint; soon after which they shook hands and parted.</P>

<P>The theatre is the only place where I may be al∣lowed to contemplate those charms, without offending your ri∣gid notions. There leaning against a pillar, alone in the midst of a surrounding croud, my eyes remain immovably fixed upon your box;—you see me not, while I see only you;—some∣times, indeed, your fan or muff are alone to be seen;—but even to behold them is soothing to me.</P>

<P>Secretary Allbrand, you forget your engagement.— Solely on the condition, that in future I should hear no more such language, did I consent to conceal from my husband, whom you call your friend, a passion, which to view in the most favor∣able light, is the height of imprudence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Allbrand.</SPEAKER>
<P>Could a mind like yours harbor the idea of sow∣ing the seeds of discord between two friends, who so long since, even as youths at the university, swore eternal fidelity to each other?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emilia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you observed your oath?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abllrana.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can it be perjury towards friendship to admire what my friend has found so lovely? to adore the being who makes him happy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emilia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Think as you please, in silence; b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> never forget that the wife of Morland can only admit your friendship and esteem; but will steadily reject all pretensions to your admiration or love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Allbrand.</SPEAKER>
<P>Happy Morland! yet at least permit me to com∣plain of the injustice of fate; that I who have never loved but once in my life, whose constancy might be entitled to some re∣compence, am compelled in silence to cherish a hopeless passion; while he, who, for years, only roved from flower to flower, is re∣paid by an ardor and steadiness of attachment which such levity ill deserves;—that I, to whom innocence was ever sacred, am now scorned, rejected, while he, who at Strasburgh—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emilia.</SPEAKER>
<P>No more!—I will not hear you!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Allbrand.</SPEAKER>
<P>Far be from me the malignant wish to derogate from the merits of my worthy friend! particularly to injure him in the esteem of one in whom his whole happiness is centered! If at the time I reproved him severely for deceiving an innocent girl with false promises—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emilia.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis false!—Morland never deceived any one!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Allbrand.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not mention this lapse, as a thing wholly un∣pardonable. He was young—a perfect Adonis among the wo∣men,—was
<PB N="13" REF="037751_0013_100F00AA8E3C5D08"/>
it surprising that such admiration should make him vain? and we all know to what lengths vanity will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a man; perhaps the want of opportunity alone, protected me from doing the like. But, what excites my indignation is, that partial fate should give him a reward due only to the purity of a first passion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emilia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Secretary Allbrand, even if this story, in the dis∣closure of which you seem to find so much gratification, were true, why relate it to me? how does it concern me? what purpose do you hope to make it answer to yourself? For two years, I have been united to Morland; he has studied incessantly to promote my happiness; I have no wish unsatisfied; and what passed prior to our union, is indifferent to me; If my husband was once wild, I esteem myself the more fortunate that such courses are now entirely abandoned by him. Above all things, I de∣test the malignity that would trace back the life of a man even to his cradle, to enumerate how many times in his childhood his mother was constrained to use the rod. In short, Sir, I will hear no more! To preserve domestic harmony, and spare my husband some hours of painful chagrin, I have hitherto been silent; but be assured, the next time that a similar expression shall escape your lips, all shall be revealed, whatever may be the conse∣quence.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P>To speak in plain terms;—for as you could not pos∣sibly unravel this aegnima, yourself, I must, for once, allow my∣self to say more than I usually do. In my early years I was a courtier, but the court is not my element; fortunately for me I became acquainted with John Howard, who taught me to be a man. Peace to his ashes! Many an infirmary, many a prison have we examined together; and by this intercourse my mind was gradually strengthened and enlightened. When he quitted England for the laudable purpose of extending his benevolence to the whole race of mankind, I attached myself to his compa∣ny. With him I have explored the interior of Africa, and visit∣ed Abyssinia, though not, like Bruce, drank to the health of a Prince whose dominions lay somewhere about the source of the Nile. My concern was rather with the sources of good and ill in the heart of man—the sources whence might flow happiness in life, and composure in death.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Morland.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you have succeeded?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thus much I have ascertained—That under the palm-tree of Negroland, as under the oak of Germany, domestic peace, and domestic comforts, are, if not the only, at least the prime sources, of mortal happiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Morland.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(Smiling)</STAGE>
And were you obliged to explore the interior of Africa to ascertain that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P>What lies direclly before our eyes, is often sought at the greatest distance. Every spreading tree that we behold, in∣vites us to enjoy peace and serenity beneath its shade; but we pass it by, and only hope to taste repose beyond the grave.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Morland.</SPEAKER>
<P>And the experience you have collected in your travels, you wish to reduce into practice?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are right. This has long been my wish, and at length I hope the object is attainable. For four years past, I have been in search of a good wife.</P>

<SPEAKER>Morland.</SPEAKER>
<P>So long, and not yet found one? your researches must have been conducted very negligently; many good wives are to be found.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis possible,—but I have seen so much of the world, that I have become suspicious—this is the worst effect of ex∣perience. My feelings are like those of a connesseur in paint∣ing, who, amid a magnificent groupe of figures, should pass over the most prominent with contempt, and gaze with delight and astonishment at one, which to the eyes of common observers, appeared lost in the superior grandeur of the rest. Believe me, Mr. Morland, it is a true, but melancholly observation, that our sensibilities to the joys of life, evaporate as the transient dew-drops upon the rose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Morland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, a prudent man should endeavor the more ar∣dently to cherish them, while a last fleeting drop still remains.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P>Such is my determination. My pilgrimage is at an end; I am arrived at my goal.—Jenny has won my whole soul, she is the single drop I wish to cherish. Her form is lovely— her mind far superior—her understanding is cultivated, while her heart remains true to nature;—She is charitable and benevolent, without knowing it—witty, without intending it. She never concerns herself with the affairs of others, nor scans the fashion of her neighbor's new gown or cap, to turn them into ridicule. She endeavours to exculpate all who are guilty only of weaknes∣ses, and never condemns in severe terms even the most palpable criminality. Above all things, she possesses that richest of all treasures, an equanimity of temper which is the same yesterday, to-day, to-morrow, and forever. Oh! what an infinite source of happiness is idcluded in that one quality!</P>

How came you so intimately acquainted with this phoenix?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P>First at the theatre.</P>
</SP>

<P>I did not know that you had ever accompanied her into our box.</P>

<P>An opera-glass acqua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntance then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor can there be a better medium for forming an ac∣quaintance; provided the mind will use it,—nor merely the eye. I will venture to assest, that a tolerably accurate opinion may always be formed of a woman, only by attentively observing her behaviour at the theatre.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Morland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly visionary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mean, supposing the piece to be such as affords suffici∣ent ground for observation. For instance, if a woman be looking around at the company, when Philip is engaged in conversation with Posa, I can immediately measure the extent of her under∣standing. If at the lamentations of the mother in Iffland's Forest∣ers, or at the story of Just's spaniel,—a woman's eyes remain dry; it gives me an immediate insight into her heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Morland.</SPEAKER>
<P>And Jenny was accidentally so fortunate—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P>Accidentally!—Jenny, was still Jenny. She never came to see and be seen, but always sat in the corner of her box absorbed in attention to the piece. Her smiles and tears were not ostentatiously displayed, but lost in her muff; she never clapped, but appeared uneasy when any fine passage was interrupt∣ed by the clapping of others. This made me observant—I conti∣nued my observations for some months—I found that these were not the mere impulses of the moment, but the settled feelings of her heart; and I resolved to become acquainted with her.— Where, and in what manner to procure an introduction to this fair incognita, then became the question?—Should I seek to dazzle the imagination of my future wife with the prospect of rank and fortune?—No! never! never!—If the humble Edward Smith could not win her affections; I resolved that her hand should never be given to the rich Lord Sidney. I heard that you were in want of a clerk; I offered my services,—my plan suc∣ceeded—they were accepted. Under this disguise I have for two
<PB N="24" REF="037751_0024_100F00C0612C4B58"/>
months secretly watched every thought, every action, of the be∣loved object—I have observed her, under circumstances when even the slightest veil that conceals the feelings of the soul, is thrown aside; and my reason is now satisfied;—it has permitted my heart to speak.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Morland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does my sister know this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heaven forbid!—You are her brother, a man of sense and discernment, and stand in the place of her father—have you any thing to say against it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Morland.</SPEAKER>
<P>My lord, how can I—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pshaw!—Has a single word escaped me that might be supposed to come from the mouth of a lord?—To go farther, I will also own, that I have no less accurately observed you—I am convinced you are an honest man;—I as little throw away my friendship lightly, as my love. Will you be my friend?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Morland.</SPEAKER>
<P>With my whole heart!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P>Enough!—Give me your hand!—no more at present, and let what has passed, remain a profound secret.</P>

</SP>
<SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of making improper remarks upon the war.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ellfield.</SPEAKER>
<P>Could my colonel be guilty of conduct so dishono∣rable as to make a private conversation the subject of an official report?</P>

<P>Recollect, that one indiscreet word will often do more mischief, than a thousand brave arms can repair.</P>

<P>My remarks were such as might be made with the strictest propriety, among a circle of friends over a bottle.</P>
</SP>

<P>What reliance was to be placed upon that friend∣ship?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ellfield.</SPEAKER>
<P>Experience informs me—alas! too late.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>You would have acted more prudently in times like the present, when all the bonds that unite society are re∣laxed, not to trust too implicitly to those of friendship. I wish you a good morning, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ellfield.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your excellency has at least laid down a doctrine, whence, bitter as it is, I might draw an inference that would furnish me some consolation, amid the agonies of disappointed hope; for when all other bonds are relaxed, why is that to be regarded which would force us to live? and, of what value is
<PB N="34" REF="037751_0034_100F00D4291AA8C8"/>
life to one bowed to the earth by corporeal and mental suffering? Yes, with my one remaining arm I should certainly discharge a pistol through that head which has been the undersigned cause of my misfortune; did not an unfortunate being, who in my happier days united her fate with mine, look to me alone for so∣lace and support.—But I dare not leave a helpless wife, a prey to hunger and despair!—However reluctant I may be therefore to solicit farther; I must still entreat your excellency to grant me some trifling pension, that may preserve us from the extremity of want. Do not suppose this hat, shot through in so many places, is worn from ostentation—believe me, I have no other. My sword, and a heart glowing with love for my native country, is all the wealth fate has left me.</P>

<P>Necessity.—Your Excellency well knows, how small is the productive, how great is the consuming trade about a court. Our inland manufactures are little encouraged; they are almost entirely superseded by the English.—A thousand ra∣pid streams flow out of this city,—one little rivulet alone flows into it.

<P>I know, must be considered;—nor are the citizens insensible to the convulsion that shakes all Europe; but they know also that we inhabit a happy corner of the earth, which nature, united with the wisdom of its rulers, have preserved from these convulsions; and they hope—</P>

<P>Last night, as I was upon duty, patrolling about the streets, I saw a well dressed woman, followed by a maid, with a bundle under her arm, steal softly across the castle square.— She looked anxiously round her, several times, while I thought within myself, who can this be?—when she came to the well, she stopped and hemmed three or four times; and in a few
<PB N="43" REF="037751_0043_100F00E7A94C0968"/>
moments the house door, at No. 312, was opened, and she entered. I remained wandering about the square for more than an hour,—to be sure the time seemed a little tedious, but at last the door opened again, and the lady came out;—she was attended to the door by a man, of whom she took leave very kindly, promissing to visit him again the next night.— With that she tripped hastily away; and I stole softly after her, till she reached her own house.—And now, whom do you think she might be?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Allbrand.</SPEAKER>
<P>Impossible!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pilz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, very certain; for he is the only man in the house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Allbrand.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you know him?</P>

<SP>

<P>No, but I know that he is very poor.</P>

<P>Are you certain of the truth of this story?</P>

<P>Give me a box on the ear every day, for the rest of my life if I did not last night see Mrs. Morland go to visit captain Ellfield.</P>

suspect any thing amiss here! but no matter! it has that ap∣pearance at least; and I can make it of important use in for∣warding my plans. It may be employed as an engine for betray∣ing the husband into the commission of some rash action, and of intimidating the wife into compliance with my wishes. Yes, it is a most fortunate accident!—

<P>'Tis too fine, too expensive for my present situation!—Ad∣mirable woman!—Now, I am once more out of bed, and clothed again; I could fancy myself in perfect health!—Had I a little more colour, no one would imagine that I had so lately, for ten days together, been on the very brink of the grave. My hands, my strength, are restored; I can walk and stand with∣out the assistance of a stick, or supporting myself against the wall!—thanks!—eternal thanks! to my benefactress, and my

<STAGE>(She goes to the window)</STAGE>
I dressed myself only for him—I know he will rejoice to see me thus!—but—
<STAGE>(She draws out a broken pocket looking-glass)</STAGE>
There was a time, when I was accustomed to a splendid toilette, with a glass in which I could see myself from head to foot!—fye! fye!— I ought not to bestow one thought upon such follies!—My Charles is still spared, and all other losses are scarcely worth a sigh!—He is a cripple, alas!—but his heart beats with equal warmth for me, as in his prosperous days; and my hands shall labour for his support!—When he was borne wounded from the field of battle, and I knelt in despair beside his almost life∣less body; had I another wish, or could I breathe another prayer, save for his recovery?—My prayers were heard!—he did recover!—and I am happy!</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>

<P>Because, if you suppose all married people to be as my brother and sister, you mistake.</P>

</SP>

<P>Most matches are unhappy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of that I very much doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can plead frequent observations of the fact, in sup∣port of my assertion. Two young people fall desperately in love with each other, and think they never can exist asunder;—a head-strong father, or a cross guardian interposes, and thwarts their wishes:—the young people sigh and pine—and pine and sigh—till at length the old people's hearts are melted. Then the lovers fancy they stand upon the highest pinnacle of fortune's temple, and clasped in each other's arms, look down with indif∣ference on every object, in the busy world around them; they rush forward into wedlock, as the night-walker to the lowest edge of the sloping roof, when suddenly some one calls, they start, they wake, and down they fall.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very ingenious simile; but the position on which it is founded, is not fact.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>And there lie the poor souls, stretched in the mire of <HI>ennui,</HI> exchanging looks of discontent with each other. If, in∣deed, they be at bottom, people of sense and worth; powerful habit, after a while, will come to their assistance; till at length,
<PB N="55" REF="037751_0055_100F0102730660C0"/>
they will learn to endure each other's foibles with patience;— and each will jog on contentedly along the paved foot-path, to which his steps must be confined; thankful if no thorns spring up to obstruct and wound him as he proceeds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if esteem be the mother of love?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is, at best, no more than a step-mother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P>Those who can reason upon love, have indeed never loved.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>And are to be envied.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be pitied.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>An unknown happiness can have no charms.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P>A false axiom. Do you suppose that miners, con∣demned to grovel at an immense depth under ground, never long to behold the sun?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have high ideas of love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P>And still higher of wedlock.
<STAGE>(he pushes the chair on which he leans, somewhat nearer to Jenny, but without altering his position)</STAGE>
Love ties two beings together;—wedlock makes them only one. Love drinks down large draughts from the cup of joy;—wedlock sips up the sweets, a drop at a time; nor finish∣es them till arrived at the very brink of the grave. Love is a caterpillar, devouring dainties;—wedlock, the same caterpillar, transformed into a butterfly, when it feeds only upon the purer nourishment of the fragrance exhaled by flowers. Years roll on; but a good wife never becomes old;—winter succeeds to sum∣mer; but wedded happiness never chills. The kiss of a chaste wife, is the stamp with which nature seals her choicest blessings; —storms roar above; lightning flashes around; but where domestic love dwells, every trouble, every sorrow, is but half felt —every joy, every pleasure, is doubled.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>You grow animated.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(sitting down and drawing the chair nearer to her)</STAGE>
Woe to that man who would remain cold and insensible, while descanting on female beauty and virtue!—who would drink out of the same cup with him?—Woe to the man who pays no more respect to a good wife, than to his night gown; but because she administers daily, nay hourly, to his comfort, receives her at∣tentions without one grateful feeling; and only learns to prize domestic happiness, when lost forever!—Let thy crowns, O Chance! be scattered about like flakes of snow; I would not catch at one;—I only ask thee to bestow upon me, the simple garland of love!
<STAGE>(he draws his chair still nearer)</STAGE>
— Should I at length find what I have, so many years sought—find my hopes, my wishes, realized—then farewel, ye petty tyrants of the mind, ambition, thirst of fame, ardour to obtain the palm of wit!—my heart shall have no room for any guest but love. The sweet calm of domestic peace, firm union of souls, a taste for the joys of nature, love for the unempoisoned air of the coun∣try, for rural pastimes, for the pleasures of retirement, where we may live remote from envy and calumny—from—</P>

Our finest dreams are seldom realized.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(drawing his chair by degrees, quite close to her)</STAGE>
That I love, is no dream;—but that I flatter myself with my love being returned, in equal portion, may perhaps be the mere effect of a presumptuous vision. For the first time in my life, I feel my happiness dependent upon the favour of others; and, for the first time in my life, I tremble. Words are but poor interpreters of our thoughts; let this tremor vouch the truth of my feel∣ings?</P>

I thought I heard my name mentioned in the study!—Yet, what concern can my name have with business?—Shall I?—No! shame on the idea!—far be from me the meanness of listening.

<P>Close by you; and when I saw you borne away, I was about to follow you down the street; but it soon occurred to me, that I might possibly render you more important service,

by seeking intelligence at the fountain-head. I was like one thunderstruck:—of the true motives for this proceeding, I could not entertain a doubt; but I had no conception of the pretext that would be urged to sanction it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Morland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well!—but my wife!—my wife!</P>

<P>Nor are his apprehensions yet removed; though a prisoner, he considers you as still a formidable obstacle to his views; and the Valet doubts whether you will be permitted to remain here. A removal to some more secure fortress, upon the frontiers, is talked of.</P>

<P>I will appeal to the laws!—a hearing cannot be refused me!</P>

<P>To the laws!—Are you the first person who has been buried alive?—whose cries have in vain sought to force their way to the ear of justice?—And what purpose would be an∣swered, supposing you could obtain a hearing?—Is it not notori∣ous to all the world, that you are innocent, but who will venture to pronounce you so, when the Prince's honour is involved in the establishment of your guilt?—You are a foreigner; you have no relations, no connections, here, to concern themselves in your fate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Morland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Forsaken wretch that I am!—Oh, Emilia!—Emi∣lia!—Yes, Allbrand, I can readily conceive that the mind, even of a virtuous woman may be seduced by the allurements of am∣bition, by the blandishments of a voluptuary, till her honour be∣comes

their sacrifice—yet still, she has a heart!—Shame may, for a while, be silenced and put to flight; but, at length, it will return, strew the bed of roses with thorns, and change the smile of passion into convulsive distortions. Then will busy recollection reproach her, that for two years her love had been my all—that my heart, my life, had been devoted to the promotion of her happiness—that I had sacrificed every thing to my love—had known no joy without her—no sorrow when she was by my side! —Oh-h-h!</P>

<P>To justify that appellation, I will begin with relating a story. In the course of my rambles, I once came to a small town, the romantic situation of which charmed me, and I re∣mained

for several weeks fixed to the spot. It was surrounded by a chain of hills, at whose foot meandered a beautiful stream; and these were my daily haunt. One evening I had stayed out very late, and was wandering solitarily homewards, by twilight, along the water-side, when suddenly I saw and heard, among the trees, a female form, wringing her hands violently, and uttering deep sighs and groans, as she staggered backwards and forwards, to the brink of the river. Curiosity induced me to conceal myself that I might observe her farther; and, in a few moments, I saw her plunge into the stream. I am a good swimmer; I sprung in after her, and was fortunate enough so save her life: yet she did not thank me for—What think you, young gentleman, of the privy chamber?—what reason do you suppose she gave for this attempt at self-destruction?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Smith.</SPEAKER>
<P>"I am, said she, the daughter of an humble citizen, and possessed no other wealth, but my honour and innocence. Of these, a young man, a student here, sought to beguile me: but failing in his attempt, he had recourse to a most cruel revenge. He traduced my character in all companies; till at length, wherever I went, the neighbors pointed at me with their fingers; my former friends looked askance at me; and worse than all, my lover, an honest mechanic—oh, terrible to think on! desert∣ed me. I could not support myself against such undeserved ig∣nominy, I was driven to despair, and I resolved to put an end to my life." You do not seem well, sir?</P>

Right! and like that unfortunate girl you have plunged into a rushing stream, whence I may perhaps equally succeed in rescuing you. Young man, that dreadful example ought to have served you as a warning; under its influence you made me a solemn promise to subdue your fatal propensity to calumny: but ask your heart how faith∣fully that promise has been kept. Though all who have become sacrifices to your tongue, may not have made like attempts up∣on their lives, yet who can tell how many a bitter tear has been shed in secret, of which you only were the cause: how much domestic happiness may have been destroyed by one word alone, perhaps carelessly uttered by you. The ears of mankind are
<PB N="108" REF="037751_0108_100F016C32D9B728"/>
always open for the reception of slander, but are often inflexibly closed against all attempts at its refutation: a hint is easily given, but its effects cannot easily be calculated: a thought∣less word trips lightly over the tongue; but it cannot be recal∣led by the Almighty himself.</P>

You might be splendid by virtue: and you only glitter by rank: You might enlighten from merit, and you only dazzle with wit. Your heart would gain you friends, but they are repulsed by your head: you might attract love, and you only coquet with fear. To slander a worthy man, who is peaceably following his own pursuits, is no less base, than to murder one who sleeps: and to re-establish the character of the undeserved victim of calumny, is a task scarcely less difficult, than to smooth over scars of the small-pox.</P>

He is a thief who steals into men's houses, and robs them of more precious treasures than gold and silver—he is a murder∣er who attacks the inoffensive and unarmed, and deprives them of even more than life. Restore to the State a citizen, to whom his duty was ever sacred, and who has too dearly atoned for his only weakness—placing confidence in this man.</P>

<PB N="114" REF="037751_0114_100F0178CDC68128"/>
would venture to pledge my life that they contain nothing im∣proper. But Mr. Morland is a philosopher and a poet: and in the course of philosophical investigation, or in the composition of poetry, things are often hastily written, which were never inten∣ded for any other eye than the writer's. A random line may condemn a man, only for want of being considered in connexion with the context—the writing-desk is a friend to whom we con∣fide every effusion of the heart, or imagination—has any one a right to put this friend to the rack? or if he possessed it, would he avail himself of the right?</P>

<P>I will, my Lord: yet not to waste the little strength possessed by one scarcely restored to life, upon a vil∣lain, but to save the guiltless, to vindicate the aspersed character of an angel.—How my husband fought for his native country: how he was crippled in her service: and what recompense his valour has received, you already know—The long and painful confinement he underwent, in recovering from his wounds, ex∣hausted at once our slender means, and my health: and scarcely was he able to rise from the bed of sickness, when I was seized with a dreadful fever. The delirium attendant upon my disor∣der, deprived me for two months of all sense of our sorrows: and I had sunk unknown, unnoticed, into the grave, had not an accident conducted a lady, a total stranger to us, into our garret. To her benevolence alone, am I indebted for my recovery: she attended me with the affection of a sister: her purse, her heart, were ours: yet she kept her name in concealment: nor knew we till yesterday, when a villainous accident revealed it to us.—

<PB N="120" REF="037751_0120_100F0185F9CBE9E8"/>
and with insidious promises and persuasions, endeavored to pur∣chase our assistance to his base designs upon her virtue—We spurned his proposals with indignation; but he is no half villain: and last night, as she was administering her usual consolation to our sufferings, he again entered our lodging, and solicited a pri∣vate interview with our guest, on pretence of some important business that concerned her husband. This, after some hesita∣tion, she granted.
