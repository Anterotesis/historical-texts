Men love curious pictures but they would have <HI>them</HI> set in golden frames. Some are so degenerate, as to think any to be good e∣nough, who have but goods enough. Take <HI>heed</HI> for sometimes the bag &amp; baggage go together. The person should be a figure, and the portion a Cypher, which added to her, ad∣vances the summe, but alone signifies nothing
<PB REF="039279_0045_1013D70C52432FA8"/>
When <HI>Themistocles</HI> was to marry his daughter, two Suitors courted her toge∣ther, the one rich and a fool, the other wise, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> poor; and being deman<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ded which of the two he had rather his daughter should have, answered, <HI>mallem virum sine pecunia, &amp;c.</HI> I had rather she <HI>should</HI> have a man without mo∣ney, than mony without a man.</P>
<P><PB REF="039279_0046_1013FAE4E9753478"/>Thirdly, choose not by your ears, for the dignity of her parentage A good old stock may nourish a fruitless branch. There are many children who are not the blessings, but the blemishes of their pa∣rents. They are nobly descended, but ignobly minded. Such was <HI>Aur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣lius Antonius,</HI> of whom it was said, that he injured his Country in nothing,
<PB REF="039279_0046_1013FAE4E9753478"/>
but in being the father of such a child. There are many low in their decents that are high in their de∣serts. Such was the Col∣lers Son, who grew to be a famous Captain: when a great person upbraided the meanness of his origi∣nal, my nobility (saith he) begins with me, but thy nobility ends with thee. Piety is a greater honour than parantage. She is
<PB REF="039279_0047_1013FAE74EFC6530"/>
the best Gentlewoman that is heir of her own deserts, and not the dege∣nerated off-spring of a∣nothers vertue.</P>
<P>Secondly, to present <HI>you</HI> with a good choice in three things.</P>
<P N="1">1 Choose such an one as will be subject to your dominion. Take heed of yoking your selves with untaimed H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fers.</P>
<P N="2">2 Choose such an one as
<PB REF="039279_0047_1013FAE74EFC6530"/>
may sympathize with you in your affliction. Mar∣riage is just like a Sea Voyage, he that enters into this Ship, must look to meet with storms and tempests, 1 Cor. 7.28. <HI>They that marry shall have trouble in the flesh.</HI> Flesh &amp; trouble are married toge∣ther, whether we marry or no▪ now a bitter cup is drunk by one mouth. A heavy burden is easily
<PB REF="039279_0048_1013FAE8D396C928"/>
carried by the assistance <HI>of</HI> others shoulders. Husband and wife should not be proud flesh; neither dead flesh. You are fel¦low Members, therefore should have a fellow fee∣ling. While one stands safe on the shore, the other should pity him that is tost on the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. Sympathy in suffering, is like a dry house in a wet day.</P>
<P N="3">3 Choose such an one as
<PB REF="039279_0048_1013FAE8D396C928"/>
may be serviceable to <HI>your</HI> salvation. A man may think he hath a Saint, when he hath a Devil, but take heed of a Harlot that is false to thy bed, and of a hypocrite that is false to thy God</P>
<P>Secondly, To those women that have hus∣bands, how to use them, in two things</P>
