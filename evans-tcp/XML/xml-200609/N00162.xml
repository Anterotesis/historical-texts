<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>ALthough I was not altogether negligent, in noting down such occurrences, respecting the present <HI>Warr</HI> with the Heathen in <HI>New-England,</HI> as came to my knowledge, in the time of them: yet what I did that way was meerly for my own private use, nor had I the least thought of publishing any of my <HI>Observati∣ons,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch time as I read a <HI>Narrative</HI> of this <HI>Ware,</HI> said to be written by a Merchant in <HI>Boston,</HI> which it seems met with an <HI>Imprimatur</HI> at <HI>London</HI> in December <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast: the abounding mistakes therein caused me to think it necessary, that a true <HI>History</HI> of this affair should be published. Wherefore I resolved (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) to <HI>methodize</HI> such scattered <HI>Observations</HI> as I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad by me, so were the <HI>Hora subseciva</HI> of a few dayes improved. Whilst I was doing this, there came to my hands another <HI>Narrative</HI> of this Warr, written by a <HI>Quaker</HI> in <HI>Road-Island,</HI> who pretends to know the Truth of things; but that Narrative being fraught with worse things then <HI>meer Mistakes,</HI> I was there∣by quickned to expedite what I had in hand. I moved has some other might have done it, but none presenting, I thought of his Saying. <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fieri mallem quàm à me, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed à me tamen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> quám à <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> And I hope that in one thing, (though it may be in little else) I have performed the part of an <HI>Historian,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> in endeavouring to relate things truly and im∣partially, and doing the best I could that I might not lead the <HI>Reader</HI> into a Mistake. <HI>History</HI> is indeed in it self profitable Study. Learned men know that <HI>Poly<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ius,</HI> and the great Philosopher call it, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. And there is holy Scripture to encourage in a work of this nature; for what was the <HI>Book of the Warrs of the Lord.</HI> Num. 21.14.? And that Book of <HI>Father</HI> which we read of in <HI>Jos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and in <HI>Samuel?</HI> Yea and the Book of the <HI>Cronicles,</HI> mentioned in the Book of Kings (for we find not some of those things referred unto in the <HI>Canonical</HI> Book of <HI>Cronicles</HI>) What were these Books, but the faithfull <HI>Records</HI> of the providentiall Dispensati∣ons of God, in the dayes of old? Yea and it is proper for the Ministers of God to ingage themselves in Services of this nature; Witness the <HI>History,</HI> or <HI>Comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Prophet I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>do,</HI> 2. Cron. 13.32. Whether my defective manner of management in this History renders in uprofitable, I know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or, Considering the other employments that are alwayes upon me, together
<PB REF="000220_0003_0FA36B3198EC3BD8"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> personal inabilityes, I have cause to suspect it may be so, in a great measure. If any one shall hereby be incited to do better, I hope I shall ra∣ther thank then envy h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. And I earnestly with that some effectu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l course may be taken (before it be too late) that a just <HI>History of New-England,</HI> be written and published to the world. That is a thing that hath been often spoken of, but was never done to this day; and yet the longer it is deferred, the more difficulty will there be in effecting of it.</P>
<P>Moreover, the thing which I mainly designed, was the subsequent <HI>Ex∣hortation</HI> which is annexed herewith, wherein I have desi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to approve my self as in the sight of God, speaking what I believe God would have me to speak, without respect to any person in this world: And there is one thing insisted on therein, concerning which I could wish that I had said more, I mean that which doth respect endeavours for the <HI>Conversion</HI> of the <HI>Heathen</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto <HI>Christ.</HI> There are some that make a wronge use of a Notion of Mr. <HI>Cottons</HI> touching this matter, alleadging that he taught that a general <HI>Con∣version</HI> of <HI>Indians</HI> is not to be expected before the seven Vials are poured forth upon the Antichristian state, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> before the conversion of the Jewish nation. It is far from my purpose to Contradict that <HI>Great Author,</HI> unto whose dust (in respect of near <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>inity</HI> as well as on the account of his emi∣nency in Grace and spiritual Gifts) I owe a sacred Reverence, &amp; it is known that I have my self asserted the same notion both in Sermons, and in a prin∣ted <HI>Discourse concerning the Salvation of the tri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es of Israel.</HI> But it was never intended that that Assertion should be improved, so as to discourage from the prosecution of that which was the prosessed, pious, and a main design of the <HI>Fathers</HI> of this <HI>Colony;</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>To propagate the Gospel and Kingdome of Christ among these Indians, who in former Ages had not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eard of his same and Glory.</HI> It is indeed true, that although a <HI>Fullness of the Gentiles</HI> in respect of <HI>Apostasy,</HI> shall be accomplished (so most they <HI>fulfill their Times</HI> ) before the calling of the Jews, yet the fullness of the Gentiles in respect of <HI>Conversion,</HI> will not come in before that. Nevertheless a glorious Sprinkling, and great Success of the Gospel, may be in particular places at present, even a∣mongst Heathen. And the Salvation of a few immortal Souls is worth the labour of many, all their lives. And happy experience hath confirmed this; for here in <HI>New-England,</HI> six Churches have been constituted amongst the Indians. And the labours of <HI>Robert Junius</HI> forty years since a∣mongst the East-Indians in <HI>Formosa,</HI> were wonderfully succesfull, For (<HI>as Caspar Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>llius</HI> Pastor of the Church in <HI>Daventry</HI> in <HI>Holland</HI> writing the <HI>History</HI> of that affair, doth relate) there were no less then <HI>five thou∣sand &amp; nine hundred Indians</HI> that became prosessedly subject to the Gospel, &amp;
<PB REF="000220_0004_0FA36B32B43278F8"/>
were all, together with their children, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Junius</HI> having learned the <HI>Indian</HI> Language, and being a Man of exempla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Piety in his conversation, and one also that excelled in Wisdome and Spiritual Abilities, God was with him, and made him an happy Instrument of winning Souls. He translated some part of the Scripture, and wrote Catechismes, and other profitable Books in their Language. He caused Schools to be e∣rected among those blind <HI>Bar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arians,</HI> so as that <HI>six hundred</HI> of them were able to read, and write, and about <HI>fifty</HI> who excelled in knowledge, and were of approved godliness, became <HI>Instructors</HI> of others in the Principles of the true Christian Religion: yea in <HI>three and twenty Towns,</HI> there were <HI>Indian</HI> Christian <HI>Churches Planted.</HI> And learned Men were sent out of <HI>Holland,</HI> in order to a further propagation of the interest of the Gospel in those re∣mote parts of the World. Also <HI>Justus Heurnius,</HI> who was at first a <HI>Physitian,</HI> being inflamed with a singular zeal after Gods glory, and the Salvation of Souls of men, left his practising in <HI>Medecinal Cures,</HI> and betook himself wholy to the study of <HI>Divinity;</HI> after which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e engaged in a Voyage to∣wards the <HI>East-Indians,</HI> designing their <HI>Conversion,</HI> and having learned the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Language,</HI> spent fourteen years amongst them: and as the great <HI>Vo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tius</HI> (in his Disputation, <HI>dé vocatione Gentium</HI> ) testifieth, was instrumental to the <HI>Conversion</HI> of many of those <HI>Indians,</HI> so as to erect <HI>Churches</HI> of them in di∣vers places, yea, and took care for the <HI>learned Education</HI> of divers young∣men, even amongst the <HI>Indians</HI> themselves, so as that they were able to in∣struct the several Churches, which by the blessing of God upon his Labours had been lately formed. It is great pity then, that we in <HI>New-England,</HI> who do not come behind others in Profession, and Pretences to Religion, should fall short in real endeavours, for the promotion and propagation of Reli∣gion, &amp; Christianity amongst those that have been for ages that are past <HI>without God, and without Christ, and Strangers to the Common-wealth of Israel.</HI> It troubleth me, when I read how the <HI>Papists</HI> glory in that they have con∣verted so many of the East and West <HI>Indians</HI> to the Christian Faith, and re∣proach <HI>Protestants</HI> because they have been no more industrious in a work of that nature. Though I know they have little cause to Glory, if the whole truth were known. For as for many of <HI>their Converts,</HI> inasmuch as they are become <HI>Vassals,</HI> not only to the Herefies, but to the Persons of those who have Proselyted them, they are as Christ said concerning the proselytes of the Scribes and Pharisees, <HI>twofold more the Children of Hell,</HI> then they were before; and many of them know little of <HI>Christianity</HI> besides the <HI>Name.</HI> Witness the celebrated Story of that <HI>Franciscan,</HI> who wrote a Letter to a Friend of his in <HI>Europe,</HI> wherein he glorieth that having lived fix and twenty years amongst the <HI>Indians,</HI> he had converted many thousands of them to the
<PB REF="000220_0005_0FA36B32C6C6D148"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> there was such a Book in <HI>Europe</HI> which might be of some use to him. Surely <HI>Francis</HI> himself did not excel this <HI>Franciscan,</HI> in profound Ignorance. It is also true, that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> have formerly (as was in part intimated but now) done something towards the <HI>Conversion</HI> of those <HI>Indians</HI> where they have Plantations setled. For they have caused some part of the Scrip∣ture to be translated into the <HI>Indian</HI> Language, and have out of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Treasuries maintained some learned and meet persons, on purpose, that they might become <HI>Preachers to the Indians:</HI> Nevertheless, <HI>Vo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tius</HI> in his dis∣sertation <HI>de plantatori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us Ecclesiarum,</HI> greatly bewaileth it, that no more care hath been taken about that concern of the Gospel and kingdome of Christ, and declareth what were the unhappy obstructions, hindring the <HI>Belgick</HI> Churches, from attaining a further progress in a work so desirable, but (as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e there speake<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h) <HI>infanda illa nibil attinet hic referre.</HI> And I know not, but that the Lords Holy design in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which he hath brought upon us, may (in part) be to punish us for our too great neglect in this matter. I would not detract from what hath been done that way, but rather with my Soul <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>less God for it. It is well known, that sundry of the Lords Servants in this Land, have laboured in that work: Especially Reverend Mr. <HI>Eliot</HI> hath taken most indefatigable pains, having Translated the whole Bible into the <HI>Indian Language,</HI> in which respect <HI>New-England</HI> (let Christ alone have the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of in) hath out-done all other places, so far as I have heard or read, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut it cannot be long, before that faithful, and now aged Servant of the Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eft from his Labours: sad will it be for the succeeding Generation, if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shall suffer the work of Christ amongst the <HI>Indians,</HI> to dye with him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> began it. <HI>Sed meljo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a speramess.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE WARRE With the INDIANS in NEW-ENGLAND</HEAD>
<P>THAT the Heathen People amongst whom we live, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> whose Land the Lord God of our Fathers hath given <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for a rightfull Possession, have at sundry times been pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mischievous devices against that part of the English <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which is seated in these goings down of the Sun <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> man that is an Inhabitant of any considerable standing, can be ignorance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that there have been (<HI>nec in jurid</HI> ) jealousies concerning the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>sets</HI> and <HI>Wompanoags,</HI> is notoriously known to all men. And whereas they have been quiet untill the last year, that must be ascribed to the wonderfull Providence of God, who did (as with Jacob of old, and after that with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Children of Israel) lay the fear of the <HI>English,</HI> and the dread of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all the <HI>Indians.</HI> The terror of God was upon them round about. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had they such advantages in former years as now they have, in respect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Arms and Ammunition, their bows and arrows not being comparably <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> weapons of death and destruction, as our guns and swords are, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they have been unhappily furnished. Nor were our sins ripe for so dreadfull
<PB REF="000220_0007_0FA36B344C52B578"/>
a judgment, until <HI>the Body of the first Generation</HI> was removed, and another Generation risen up which hath not so pursued, as ought to have been, the blessed design of their Fathers, in following the Lord into this Wilderness, whil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t it was a land not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>own.</P>
<P>As for the Grounds, justness, and necessity of the present <HI>War</HI> with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se barbarous Creatures which have set upon us, my <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Read the Postscript at the end of this History.</HI></NOTE> design<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s not to <HI>inlargo</HI> upon that Argument, but to leave that to others whom it mostly concerns, only in brief this. The irruption of this flame at this time was occasioned as followeth.</P>
<P>In the latter end of the year 1674. <HI>An Indian</HI> called <HI>John Sausaman,</HI> who had submitted himself unto, and was taken under the protection of the <HI>English</HI> perceiving that the <HI>profane Indians</HI> were hatching mischief against the English, he faithfully acquained the Governour of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> with what he kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w, and also what his fears were together with the grounds thereof, with∣all, declaring, that he doubted such and such Indians belonging to <HI>Philip</HI> the Sachem of <HI>Pokanoket</HI> or <HI>Mount-hope,</HI> would murder him; which quickly hap∣ned accordingly: for soon after this, <HI>John Sausaman</HI> was barbarously mur∣thered by an Indian called <HI>Tobias</HI> (one of <HI>Phillip</HI> 's chief Captains and Coun∣sellors) and by his son, and another Indian, who knocked him on the head and then left him on the Ice on a great Pond. Divine providence which u∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth to bring murther to light, so ordered as that an Indian unseen by those three that killed <HI>Sausaman;</HI> beheld all that they did to him, and spake of it, so as that a <HI>Praying</HI> (and as there is cause to hope) a godly <HI>Indian, William Nahauton</HI> by name, heard of it, and he forthwith revealed what he knew to the English. Whereupon the three Indians who had committed the mur∣ther were apprehended, and the other Indian testified to their faces that he saw them killing <HI>Sausaman.</HI> They had a fair tryall for their lives, and that no apperance of wrong might be, <HI>Indians,</HI> as well as English <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate upon the <HI>Jars</HI> and all agreed to the condemnation of those Murtherers, who were accordingly executed in the beginning of the 4<HI>th.</HI> Month called <HI>June</HI> Anno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>. They stoutly denied the fact, only at last <HI>Tobias</HI> 's son confessed that his father and the other Indian killed <HI>Sausaman,</HI> but that himself had no hand in it, only stood by and saw them doe it.</P>
<P>No doubt but one reason why the Indians murthered <HI>John Sausaman,</HI> was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of hatred against him for his Religion, for he was Christianized and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and was a Preacher amongst the Indians, being of very excellent parts, he translated some part of the bible into the Indian language, and was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to curb those Indians that knew not God on the account of their de∣bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>eryes; but the main ground why they murthered him seems to be, because he discovered their subtle and malicious designs, which they were
<PB REF="000220_0008_0FA36B35D873FE98"/>
complotting against the English. <HI>Philip</HI> perceiving that the Court of <HI>Pli∣mouth</HI> had condemned and executed one of his Counsellors, being (as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon strong grounds supposed) conscious to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> committed upon <HI>John Sansaman,</HI> must needs think that ere long they would do to him (who had no less deserved it) as they had done to his Counsellour: wherefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> contrary to his Convenant and Faith engaged to <HI>Plimouth</HI> Colony, yea and contrary to his promise unto some in this Colony (for about five years ago<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Philip</HI> made a disturbance in Plimouth Colony, but was quieted by the pru∣dent interposition of some in our Colony, when he ingaged, that if at any time hereafter he should think the English among whome he lived did him wrongs, he would not cause any disquietment before such time as he had acquainted the English of <HI>Mattachusets,</HI> but contrary to these solemn ingage∣ments he) doth call his men together and <HI>Arm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> them, and refused to come when sent for by the authority of Plimouth, unto whose goverment he had subjected himself.</P>
<P>Hereupon the English in <HI>Plimouth</HI> Jurisdiction sent a small <HI>Army</HI> to those towns next <HI>Mount-Hope</HI> in order to reducing <HI>Philip</HI> to his obedience, and for the security of those places which were in great danger and in no less fear by reason of the insolency of the Heathen.</P>
<P><HI>June.</HI> 24. (Midsummer-day) was appointed and attended as a day of so∣lemn Humiliation throughout that Colony, by fasting and prayer, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Lord to give success to the present expedition respecting the Enemy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the conclusion of that day of Humiliation, as soon as even the people in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> were come from the place where they had been praying together the Indians discharged a volly of shot whereby they killed one man &amp; with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> others. Two men were sent to call a Surgeon for the relief of the wounded, but the Indians killed them by the way: and in another part of the town six men were killed, so that there were nine English men murthered this day.</P>
<P>Thus did the <HI>War</HI> begin, this being the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> English blood which was spilt by the Indians in an hostile way. The Providence of God is deeply to be observed, that the sword should be first drawn upon a day of Humiliation, the Lord thereby declaring from heaven that he expects something else from his People besides fasting and prayer.</P>

<P>Souldiers marched out of Boston towards <HI>Mount Hope, June.</HI> 26th and continued marching that night, when there hapned a great Eclipse of the Moon, which was totally darkned above an hour. Only it must be remem∣bred
<PB REF="000220_0009_0FA36B37C4A1D250"/>
that some dayes before any souldiers went out of <HI>Boston</HI> Commissioners were sent to treat with <HI>Philip,</HI> that so if possible ingaging in a War might be prevented. But when the Commissioners came near to <HI>Mount-Hope,</HI> they found diverse english men on the ground wel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing in their town blood, having been newly murthered by the Indians, so that they could not proceed further. Yea the Indians killed a man of this Colony as he was travelling in the roade before such time as we took up arms: in which respect no man can doubt of the <HI>justness</HI> of our cause, since the enemy did shed the blood of some of ours who never did them (our enemyes themselves being judges) the least wrong before we did at all offend them, or attempt any act of hostility towards them.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 29th, was a day of publick <HI>Humiliation</HI> in this Colony appointed by the Council in respect of the <HI>war</HI> which is now begun.</P>
<P>This morning our army would have ingaged with the enemy, The In∣dians shot the Pilot who was directing our Souldiers in their way to <HI>Philips</HI> Countrey, and wounded several of our men, and ran into Swamps, rainy weather hindred a further pursuit of the Enemy. An awfull Providence happened at this time: for a souldier (a stout man) who was sent from <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> seing the English <HI>Guide</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lain, and hearing many profane oathes a∣mong some of our Souldiers (namely those Priva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eers, who were also Volun∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rs) and considering the unseasonableness of the weather was such, as that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> could be done against the Enemy, this man was possessed with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> conceit that God was against the english, whereupon he immediately can distracted, and so was returned home a lamentable Spectacle.</P>
<P>In the beginning of <HI>July</HI> there was another Skirmish with the Enemy, where<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> several of the Indians were killed, amongst whome were <HI>Philips</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hief Captain, and one of his Counsellors.</P>
<P>Now it appears that <HI>Squaw-Sachem</HI> of <HI>Pocasset</HI> her men were conjoyned with the <HI>Wompon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gs</HI> (that is Philips men) in this Rebellion.</P>
<P>About this time they killed several English at <HI>Tannton,</HI> and burnt diverse houses there. Also at <HI>Swanzy</HI> caused about half the Town to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with merciless Flames. Likewise <HI>Middlebury</HI> and <HI>Dartmouth</HI> in <HI>Pli∣mouth</HI> Colony did they burn with Fire, and barbarously murthered both men and women inthose places, stripping the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lain whether men or women, and leaving them in the open field as naked as in the day wherein they were born. Such also is their inhumanity as that they flay of the skin from their faces and heads of those they get into their hands, and go away with the hairy Scalp of their enemyes.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 19. Out Army pursued <HI>Philip</HI> who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> unto a dismal Swamp for re∣fuge: the <HI>English Souldiers</HI> followed him, and killed many of his Men, also about fifteen of the <HI>English</HI> were then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lain. The Swamp was so Boggy
<PB REF="000220_0010_0FA36B381158A0C8"/>
and thick of Bushes, as that it was judged to proceed further therein would be but to throw away Mens lives. It could not there be discerned who were <HI>English,</HI> and who the <HI>Indians.</HI> Our Men when in that hideous place if they did but see a Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tir would fire presently, whereby 'tis verily feared, that they did sometimes unhapp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y shoot <HI>English-men</HI> instead of <HI>Indians.</HI> Where∣fore a <HI>Retreat</HI> was Sounde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and night coming on, the <HI>Army</HI> withdrew from that place. This was because the desperate Distress which the Enemy was in was unknown to us: for the <HI>Indians</HI> have since said, that if the <HI>English</HI> had continued at the Swamp all night, nay, if they had but followed them but one half hour longer, <HI>Philip</HI> had come and yielded up himself. But God saw that we were not yet fit for Deliverance, nor could Health be restored unto us except a great deal more Blood be first taken from us: and other places as well as <HI>Plimouth</HI> stood in need of such a course to be taked with them. It might rationally be conjectured, that the unsuccessfulness of this Expedition against <HI>Philip</HI> would embolden the <HI>Heathen</HI> in other parts to do as he had done, and so it came to pass. For <HI>July</HI> 14. the <HI>Nipnep</HI> (or <HI>Nipmack</HI>) <HI>Indians</HI> began their mischief at a Town called <HI>Mendam</HI> (had we amended our ways as we should have done, this Misery might have been prevented) where they committed <HI>Barbarous Murders.</HI> This Day deserves to have a <HI>Remark</HI> set upon it, considering that Blood was never shed in <HI>Massachusets Colony</HI> in a way of Hostility before this day. Moreover the Pro∣vidence of God herein is the more awful and tremendous, in that this very day the Church in <HI>Dorchester</HI> was before the Lord, humbling themselves by Fasting and Prayer, on account of <HI>the Day of trouble</HI> now begun amongst us.</P>
<P>The news of this Blood-shed came to us at <HI>Boston</HI> the next day in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> time, in the midst of the Sermon, the Scripture then improved being that <HI>Isai.</HI>42.24. <HI>Who gave Jacob to the spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Lord, He against whom we have sinned?</HI></P>
<P>As yet <HI>Philip</HI> kept in the Swamp at Pocassit, but <HI>August</HI> I. (being the Lords day) he f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed. The <HI>English</HI> hearing that <HI>Philip</HI> was upon flight, pur∣sued him, with a party of <HI>Mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>egins,</HI> i.e. <HI>Unkas</HI> (who approved himself faithful to the <HI>English</HI> almost forty years ago in the time of the <HI>Pequod</HI> Wars, and now also in this present War) his <HI>Indians,</HI> They overtook <HI>Philips</HI> Party and killed about thirty of his men, none of ours being at that time cut off. Had the <HI>English</HI> pursued the Enemy they might easily have over∣taken the Women and Children that were with <HI>Philip,</HI> yea and himself also, and so have put an end to these tumults: but though Deliverance was according to all Humane probability near, God saw it not good for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> yet. Wherefore <HI>Philip</HI> escaped and went to the <HI>Nipmack</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> (as hath been intimated) done Acts of Hostility against the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB REF="000220_0011_0FA36B391512A740"/>
mean while endeavours were used to keep those <HI>Indians</HI> from engaging in this War, and that those persons who had committed the Murder at <HI>Men∣dam</HI> might be delivered up to Justice. Captain <HI>Hutchinson</HI> with a small par∣ty was sent to <HI>Quabaog</HI> where there was a great Rendezvouze of <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p Indians.</HI> They appointed time and place of Treaty to be attended, <HI>August.</HI> 2. accordingly Captain <HI>Hutchinson</HI> rode to the Place fixed on to Treat in. But the <HI>Indians</HI> came not thither according to their Agreement, whereupon Captain <HI>Hutchinson</HI> resolved to go further to seek after them elsewhere, and as he was riding along, the perfidious <HI>Indians</HI> lying in Ambuscado in a Swamp, shot at him and wounded him, of which Wounds he after dyed, and eight men that were with him were struck down dead upon the place. Captain <HI>Wheeler</HI> who was in that Company was shot through the Arm, his dutiful Son alighting to relieve his Father, was himself shot and sorely wounded, willingly hazarding his own life to save the life of his Father. The <HI>English</HI> were not in a capacity to look after their dead, but those dead bodies were left as meat for the Fowls of Heaven, and their Flesh unto the Beasts of the Earth, and there was none to bury them</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Hutchinson</HI> and the rest that escaped with their lives, hastened to <HI>Quabaog,</HI> and the <HI>Indians</HI> speedily followed, violently set upon the Town, killed divers, burning all the Houses, therein down to the ground, except only one unto which the Inhabitants fled for succour, and now also (as since we have understood) did <HI>Philip</HI> with this broken Party come to <HI>Quabaog.</HI> Hundreds of <HI>Indians</HI> beset the House, and took possession of a Barn belong∣ing thereunto, from whence they often shot into the House, and also at∣tempted to fire it six times, but could not prevail, at last they took a Cart full of Flax and other combustible matter, and brought it near the House, in∣tending to set it on fire, and then there was no appearing possibility, but all the <HI>English</HI> there, Men and Women, and Children must have perished, either by unmerciful flames, or more unmerciful hands of wicked Men whose tender Mercies are cruelties, so that all hope that they should be s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ved was then taken away: but behold in this Mount of Difficulty and Ex∣tremity (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) <HI>the Lord is seen.</HI></P>
<P>For in the very nick of opportunity God sent that worthy Major <HI>Willard,</HI> who with forty and eight men set upon the <HI>Indians</HI> and caused them to turn their backs, so that poor people who were given up for dead, had their lives given them for a prey. Surely this was a token for good, that however we may be diminished and brought low through Oppression, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and Sorrow, yet our God will have compassion on us, and this his People shall not utterly perish. And this Salvation is the more remarkable, for that al∣beit the <HI>Indians</HI> had ordered Scouts to lye in the way, and to give notice by
<PB REF="000220_0012_0FA36B3988A666B8"/>
firing three Guns, if any <HI>English</HI> came to the relief of the Distressed; yet al∣though the Scouts fired when Major <HI>Willard</HI> and his Souldiers were past them, the <HI>Indians</HI> were so busie and made such a noise about the House, that they heard not the report of those Guns; which if they had heard, in all probability not only the People then living at <HI>Quabaog,</HI> but those also that came to succour them had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cut off.</P>
<P>Things being brought to the state, the Tumult of those that are risen up increaseth continually: For <HI>August</HI> 22. being the Lords Day, the <HI>Indians</HI> a∣bout <HI>Lancaster</HI> killed a Man and his Wife, and two Children in the afternoon exercise. And we hear that <HI>Philip</HI> and the <HI>Quabaog Indians</HI> are gone more Westward, not far from <HI>North-hampton, Hadly, Doer-field,</HI> &amp;c. whereupon Forces are sent from hence, under the command of Captain <HI>Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>op,</HI> Captain <HI>Beers,</HI> and (after that) Captain <HI>Mostly</HI> to relieve those distressed Towns and pursue the Enemy. Also our Brethren at <HI>Connecticut</HI> afforded their Assist∣ance, Major <HI>Treat</HI> being sent to <HI>Hadly</HI> with a party of <HI>English,</HI> and some of <HI>Unkas</HI> his Men. The <HI>Indians</HI> inhabiting about <HI>Conecticut River</HI> pretended great fidelity to the <HI>English,</HI> and that they would fight against <HI>Philip,</HI> who it seems had been tampering with them in the Spring before the War broke∣out, endeavouring by money (<HI>i.e. Wampampeag</HI> whis is the <HI>Indians</HI> Money) to engage them in His bloody design against the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>At first they were so far credited as to be <HI>Armed</HI> by the <HI>English,</HI> hoping they might do good service as the <HI>Monhegins</HI> and <HI>Natick Indians</HI> had done. But within a while their Treachery was justly suspected. Whereupon Soul∣diers were sent (on or about <HI>August</HI> 25.) to demand their Arms. They were then gone out of their Forts, our Men searching after them, they sud∣denly shot out of a Swamp, and after that an hot dispute continued for some hours. How many <HI>Indians</HI> were slain we know not, but nine English fell that Day, wherein this Providence is observable, that those <HI>nine men</HI> which were killed at that time belonged to <HI>nine several Towns,</HI> as if the Lord should say, that he hath a controversie with every Plantation, and therefore all had need to repent and reform their ways.</P>
<P>Now the <HI>English</HI> have a multitude of open Enemies more then when this trouble began, so that greater desolations are now expected.</P>
<P>Wherefore <HI>September</HI> I. the <HI>Indians</HI> set upon <HI>Deer field,</HI> (alias <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>) and killed one man, and laid most of the Houses in that new hopeful Plantation in ruinous heaps. That which addeth solemnity and awfulness to that Desolation, is, that it happened on the very day when one of the Chur∣ches in <HI>Boston</HI> were seeking the face of God by Fasting and Prayer before him. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Also that very day the Church in <HI>Hadly</HI> was before the Lord in the same way, but were driven from the Holy Service they were attending
<PB REF="000220_0013_0FA36B3A45D96FC0"/>
by a most sudden and violent <HI>Alarm,</HI> which routed them the whole day after. So that we may humbly complain, as sometimes the Church did <HI>how long hast those smoaked</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>against the Prayers of thy People.</HI> Not long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this, Captain <HI>Beers</HI> with a considerable part of his men fell before the Enemy. Concerning the state of those parts at this time until <HI>Septem∣ber</HI> 15. Received information from a good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> whilst things were fresh in memory, which I shall here insert, as containing a brief <HI>History</HI> of the Transactions which happened within the time mentioned; those parts being then the Seat of the War: the Letter which I intended is that which followeth.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend and dear Brother;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I received yours, wherein among other things you desire an account of the passages of our War with the <HI>Indians:</HI> I shall in answer to your desire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the most remarkable passages: the people here having many causes jealousie, of the unfaithfulness of our <HI>Indians</HI> presented the same be∣fore the Committees of the Militia, whereupon it was thought meet to de∣sire of them the surrendry of their Arms, and by perswa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on obtained a∣bout nine and twenty: But about three dayes after they being desirous to go forth with some Forces from <HI>Harford,</HI> both <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>English,</HI> and some from the <HI>Bay</HI> in pursuit of <HI>Philip,</HI> their Arms were delivered to them again: but a while after their return, jealou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies still increasing, there was a general desire in the People of these three Towns, that they should be again disarmed, and such things as these were presented to the Council here, as inducing thereunto: 1. That when they heard of the Massacre at <HI>Quabaog,</HI> they made in the Fort eleven Acclamations of joy, according to the number of our men that were slain. 2. A <HI>French-man</HI> that was going to <HI>Boston</HI> gave Testimony that he met three <HI>Indians</HI> that told him they were coming to perswade <HI>North Hampton Indians</HI> to fight with <HI>Philip,</HI> and that at his return he askt our <HI>Indians</HI> whether they would fight, they said they could not tell. 3. One of their <HI>Sachims</HI> owned that there were several among them false to the <HI>English,</HI> but would not tell who they were. 4. A Woman of ours was warned by a <HI>Squaw</HI> to remove with her Children into the middle of the Town: told her withthal she durst not tell News, for if she did the <HI>Indians</HI> would cut off her head. 5. Some of theirs gave out very suspicious Expressions: one upbraided the English, that <HI>Coy</HI> was dead already, and <HI>Eyer</HI> and <HI>Pritchet</HI> were dead already: said further that the <HI>Indians</HI> went out to find <HI>Philip</HI> with the <HI>English,</HI> that when <HI>Philip</HI> was fighting with them in the front, they might fall on them in the rear: another said the reason why he went not out with the Army was that he might help to destroy the <HI>English</HI> at home: another threatned

maid of our town to knock her on the head. 6. when they were out with our Army, they shewed much unwillingness to fight, all<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>adging they must not fight against their mothers and brothers and coulins (for <HI>Quaba∣og</HI> Indians are related unto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hem) 7. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> who went out the same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> complained that our Indians had almost spoiled his, and that the English were blind and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not see the falshood of these Indians. 8. They shot bullets five several <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at our men in diverse places. Other things too, many to numerate were presented, and the Councill saw cause, to de∣mand their arms Aug 24. They made some objections, but were fully answered: The Sachem left the Councill to try wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>her be could pen∣swade the Indians, promising however to bring in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> own. In the af∣ter-noon the Councill se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t to the Fort for their, answer: they told the Messenger that some Indians, were abroad in the Meadows, and they were not Willing to deliver up their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ms without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> consent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the morning they should have their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to go again to them in the evening, to con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e with them, to try <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he could perswade them, and coming to the other side of the Rive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> some of them to come over, they bid him come over to them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him kiss—Whereupon Captain <HI>Lothrop</HI> &amp; <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons,</HI> with whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was left intended to take their arms by force, and at mid-night sent over to our officers, to draw as nigh the Fort as they could without being per∣ceived, and they would do the like on <HI>Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>field</HI> side, and so at break of day come upon them but before they came the Indians were fled, having killed an old <HI>Sachem</HI> that was not willing to go with them. The Captains resolved to follow them; and pursued a great pace after them, with about an hun∣dred men, having sent back a part of ours for a Guard of the Town. A little before they overtook the Indians, they heard two-strange claps of Thunder, like two volleys of shot; at length they saw a single Indian, but shot not at him, though they might have killed him, because they intended to parly with them, but on a sudden the Indians let fly about forty gunns at them, and was soon answered by a volley from our men; about forty ran down into the Swamp after them, poured in shot upon them, made them throw down much of their luggage; and after a while our men af∣ter the Indian manner got behind trees, and watcht their opportunities to make shotts at them; the Fight continued about three hours; we lost six men upon the ground, though one was shot in the back by our own men, a seventh dyed of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> coming home, and two dyed the next might, nine in all of nine several towns, every one of these towns lost a man.: Of the Indians as we heat since by a Squaw that was taken, and by three Children that came to our town from them the day after, there were slain

twenty six: the same day there was an Indian that lodged in our town he night before, taken by our men, and a <HI>Squaw</HI> that; belonged to our Fort that was coming from <HI>Spring-field;</HI> they both owne that our Indians received Wompam from <HI>Philip</HI> in the Spring; to ingage them in the War. The fellow also owns that there were seven of our Indians that went to <HI>Quabaog,</HI> where they heard that they intended to fight. After this fight we heard no more of them till the first of September, when they shot down a Garison Souldier of <HI>Pacomptuck,</HI> that was looking after his horse, and ran violently up into the town, many people having scarcely time enough to get into the Garisons. That day they burnt most of their houses and burns, the Garisons not being strong enough to sally out upon them, but killed two of their men from the Forts. The next day they set upon se∣veral men that were gone out of the Fort at <HI>Squakheag,</HI> they slew eight of our men, not above one of them being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ain that we know of, but made no attempt upon the Fort.

<P>Upon the 12th: of this month the Indians made an assault upon twenty two men of <HI>Pocomptuck,</HI> that were going from one garison to the other to <HI>Meeting</HI> in the afternoon: made a great volley of shot at them, but killed not one man, they escaped to the Garison whither they were going, only one man running to the other garison was taken alive: The Indians took up their rendezvouze on an hill in the meadow, burnt two more house kil'd many horses, carryed away horse-loads of beef and pork to the hill: they sent the same night for more aid, but partly through the strictness of the Commission of our Garison souldiers, or at least their interpretation of it, and partly through the wetness of the weather, there was nothing done that night: the next day we perswaded some of our Inhabitants to go Vo∣lunteers, and sent to <HI>Hadly</HI> to doe the like, who going up with some of Captain <HI>Louthrops</HI> souldiers, joyned themselves to the garison at <HI>Pocomp∣tuck,</HI> and on Tuesday very early went out to assault the Indians, but they were all fled. Last night Captain <HI>Mosely</HI> with his men came into <HI>Hadly,</HI> and this night we expect more Forces from <HI>Hartford.</HI></P>
<P>If the Lord give not some sudden Check to these Indians, it is to be fear∣ed that most of the Indians in the Countrey will rise.</P>
<P>I desire you would speak to the <HI>Governour,</HI> that there may be some thorough care for a <HI>Reformation,</HI> I am sensible there are many difficulties therein: many sins 'are grown so in fashion, that it becomes a question whether they be sins or no.

Let me hear soon from you: the Lord bless you and your Labours; forget us not at the throne of Grace: It would be a dreadfull Token of the Displeasure of God, if these afflictions pass away without much spiritual advantage: I thought to have written somewhat mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> large with respect to <HI>Reformation,</HI> but I hope I need not, you will I pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> be forward of your self therein.</P>

Not many dayes after this Letter was written, the English received a sad∣der rebuke of Providence, then any thing that hitherto had been. For <HI>Sep∣tember</HI> 18. Captain <HI>Lothrop</HI> (a godly and couragious Commander) with above seventy men were sent to be as a Gua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to some that were coming from <HI>Dee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-field</HI> with Carts loaden with Goods and Provision, to be removed to <HI>Hadly,</HI> for security: But as they were coming, the Indians, whose cru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l Habitations are the dark <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Earth, lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ked in the Swamps, and multitudes of them made a sudden and frightful assault. They seized upon the Carts and Goods (many of the Souldiers having been so foolish and se∣cure, as to put their Arms in the Carts, and step aside to gather <HI>Grapes,</HI> which proved dear and deadly Grapes to them) killed Captain <HI>Lothr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p,</HI> and above threescore of his men, stripped them of their clothes, and so left them to lye weltring in their own Blood. Captain <HI>Mosely</HI> who was gone out to range the Woods, hearing the Guns, hasted to their help, but before he could come, the other Captain and his men were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ain, as hath been expres∣sed. Nevertheless he gave the Indians Battle: they were in such numbers, as that he and his company were in extream danger, the Indians endeavou∣ring (according to their mode of fighting) to encompass the English round, and then to press in upon them with great numbers, so to knock them down with their Hatchers. In the nick of time Major <HI>Treat,</HI> with above an hun∣dred men, and threescore of <HI>Unkas</HI> his Indians came in to succour those that were so be s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t with the Enemy, whereupon the Enemy presently retreated, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> coming on, there was no pursuing of them. In this fight, but few of Captain <HI>Mosely's</HI> men were slain: How may <HI>Indians</HI> were killed is un∣known, it being their manner to draw away their dead men, as fast as they are killed, if possibly they can do it; yea, they will venture their own lives for that end, which they do out of policy, that so their Enemies may think, that few or none of them are killed, when nevertheless they have lost many. I am informed that some of the <HI>Indians</HI> have reported, that they lost ninety six men that day, and that they had above forty wounded, many of which dyed afterwards. However, this was a black and fat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l day, wherein there were eight persons made Widows, and six and twenty Children made Father∣less, all in one little Plantation, and in one day; and above sixty Persons buri∣ed in one dreadful Grave. And this was the state of the <HI>Western</HI> parts in respect of the War with the Heathen.</P>
<P>We must now take a step backwards, and a little consider the <HI>Eastern Plantations.</HI> For in the Month of <HI>September,</HI> did the flame break out there. Some who had their hearts exercised in discerning things of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> were from the beginning of the War, not without sad Apprehe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> terning the Inhabitants in those parts of the Country, in that they
<PB N="13" REF="000220_0018_0FA36B3ECB33DFC8"/>
scattered people, and such as had many of them Scandalized the Heathen, and lived themselves too like unto the Heathen, without any <HI>Instituted Ordinances,</HI> also the Indians thereabouts were more numerous then in some other places. They began their Outrages, at the House of one Mr. <HI>Purchase,</HI> who had been a great Trader with the Indians After that they came to the House of an old Man in <HI>Casco-bay,</HI> whose name was <HI>Wakely.</HI> Him with his Wife. Son and Daughter in law (who was great with Childe) and two Grand∣children, they cruelly Murdered, and took three Children alive, and led them into Captivity.</P>
<P>This old <HI>Wakely</HI> was esteemed a godly Man. He would sometimes say with tears, that he believed God was angry with him, because although he came into <HI>New-England</HI> for the Gospels sake, yet he had left another place in this Country, where there was a Church of Christ, which he once was in Communion with, and had lived many years in a Plantation where was no <HI>Church nor Instituted Worship.</HI> If a Faithful Minister of Christ happened to Preach in <HI>Casco,</HI> he would with much affection entertain him, saying, <HI>Bles∣sed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord.</HI> After this good man was mur∣thered by the Indians, they quickly did more mischief: so that in <HI>Falmouth</HI> there were five Houses burnt, four Men, two Women, and two Children killed, and three Children carried away Captive. After this they set upon <HI>Sacoe,</HI> where they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew thirteen Men, and at last burnt the Town. A prin∣ciple Actor in the destruction of <HI>Sacoe</HI> was a strange <HI>Enthufiastical Sagamore,</HI> called <HI>Squando,</HI> who some years before pretended that God appeared to him, in the form of a tall Man, in black Cloaths, declaring to him that he was God, and commanded him to leave his Drinking of Strong Liquors, and to pray, and to keep Sabbaths, and to go to hear the Word Preached, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which things the <HI>Indian</HI> did for some years, with great seeming Devotion and Conscience observe. But the God which appeared to him, said nothing to him about Jesus Christ; and therefore it is not to be marvelled at, that at last he dis∣covered himself to be no otherwise then a Childe of him, that was a Mur∣therer and a Lyar from the beginning. Also these inraged <HI>Barbarians,</HI> be∣ing annimated with their success at <HI>Falmouth</HI> and <HI>Sacoe,</HI> they went to <HI>Black∣Point,</HI> and there killed six Men and a Woman, and burnt two and twenty dwelling Houses. In the mean time, the <HI>English</HI> at <HI>Ken<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>beck</HI> endeavoured that the Indians in those parts night be kept from joyning in this <HI>Insurrecti∣on,</HI> whereto they were tempted and sollicited by their neighbours. The pru∣dent endeavours of the English proved happily successful, insomuch as the <HI>Sachems</HI> there, brought Presents with great Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>estations of Amity and Fi∣delity, and desired that no more Liquors might be sold to the <HI>Indians,</HI> pro∣sessing, that that was a principle cause of the mischiefs that had been done,
<PB N="14" REF="000220_0019_0FA36B405675D8F0"/>
and that they were not able to keep their men in subjection, when once they were become mad with drink.</P>
<P>After these things, the <HI>Indians</HI> killed two men at <HI>Kittery,</HI> and stripped them. Lieutenant <HI>Playster</HI> with twenty two English went out to fetch off the dead bodies, and to bury them; as they were putting one of them into the Cart, suddenly a small party of <HI>Indians</HI> shot out of a Swamp. And the greatest part of the English did unworthily for sake their <HI>Leader</HI> in that haz∣zard, only seven remained with him. He thinking his men had been near at hand, faced the Enemy, killed and wounded many of them, but the <HI>Indians</HI> perceiving that all but seven of the <HI>English</HI> were fled, took courage and kil∣led Mr. <HI>Plaister</HI> (who was a good and useful man) and one of his Sons, and another man: the other four seeing that, ran for their lives, and so escaped until they came safe into a <HI>Garrison,</HI> which was not far off.</P>
<P>Behold how great a matter a little free kindleth. This fire which in <HI>June</HI> was but a little spark, in three months time is become a great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me, that from East to West the whole Country is involved in great trouble; and the Lord himself seemeth to be against us, to cast us off, and to put us to shame, and <HI>and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>word not forth with our Armies.</HI> Wherefore the Magistrates of this Ju∣risdiction, earnestly called upon the Inhabitants thereof, to humble them∣selves before the Lord, and to confess and turn from transgression. In∣asmuch as the expressions contained in that paper, which was at this time published by the Councils order, for a day of publick Humiliation, to be ob∣served through this Jurisdiction, are most serious; and gracious, and greatly expressive of the sinful <HI>Degenerate Estate</HI> of the <HI>present Generation in New∣England,</HI> and that Declaration will turn for a Testimony to our faithful Ru∣lers, both now and hereafter; considering also, that it is in but few hands, I shall therefore here insert, and republish it.

<P><HI>Octob</HI> the 7th. This day of Hamilition appointed by the Council, was solemnly observed: yet acended with awfull restemonyes of divine displea∣sure. The very next day after this Fast was agreed upon by those in evill Authority, was that dismul <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fatal blow, when Captain <HI>Lothrop</HI> and his company (in all near upon four score souls) were slaughtered, whereby the Heathen were wonderfully animated, some of them triumphing and saying, that so great slaughter was never known: and indeed in their Warrs one with another, the like hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> heard of.

Also that very day at the close of it, the sad tidings of <HI>Springfields</HI> Calamity came to us here is <HI>Boston.</HI> And

inasmuch as this news came at the conclusion of a day of Humiliation, sure∣ly <HI>the Solemn voice of God to New-England</HI> is still as formerly, <HI>Praying</HI> without <HI>Reforming</HI> will not do. And now is the day come where in the Lord is fulfil∣ling the word which himself hath spoken, saying, I will send wild Beans a∣mong you, which shall rob you of your Children, and destroy your Cattle, and make you few in number, <HI>and if you will not be reform'd by these things, I will bring your Sactuaryes to Desolation, and I will not smell the Sweet Saves of your Odours.</HI> The Providence of God is never to be forgotten, in that <HI>Churches have been signally spared for so long a time.</HI> Although some Planta∣tions wherein Churches have been settled were in most eminent danger, and the Enemy might easily have swallowed them up, yet God so ordered that they received little or no detriment, when other places were laid utterly waste, the Lord an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> how loth he was to disgrace the Throne of his Glory, but now he begins with the Sanctuary. As for <HI>Springfields</HI> misery it thus came to pass: Whereas there was a body of <HI>Indians</HI> that lived in a <HI>Fort</HI> near to that <HI>Town</HI> of <HI>Springfield,</HI> and professed nothing but Friendship towards the <HI>English;</HI> they treacherously brake in upon the Town, when a party of our Souldiers who had been there, were newly gone to <HI>Hadly.</HI> They killed several, amongst others their Lieutenant <HI>Cooper</HI> was most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Murthered by them, without the least occasion or Provocation gi∣ven. They burnt down to the ground above thirty dwelling-hou∣ses, and above twenty out-houses: amongst others Mr. <HI>Pelatiah Glover</HI> Teacher of the Church there, is a great sufferer, his House, and Goods, and Books, and Writings being all consumed in one hour. Nevertheless there was a great mixture of mercy in this dark and dismal dispensation. For God so ordered, as that an <HI>Indian</HI> who knew what was designed the next day, ran away in the night, and acquainted the <HI>English</HI> therewith, whence they had time and opportunity to escape to an house that was Fortified; o∣ther wise in probability the Inhabitants had surely had their lives as well as their dwelling places cut off.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 13. The <HI>General Court</HI> fat in <HI>Boston,</HI> during this Session, a <HI>Com∣mittee</HI> was with the concurrance of both Houses appointed in order to a <HI>Re∣formation</HI> of those Evils which have provoked the Lord to bring the Sword upon us, and to withdraw from our <HI>Armies</HI> from time to time. The Assist∣ance of the <HI>Teaching Elders</HI> in the Churches was desired, as in a case of that nature, it was proper for them to advise and help according to God.</P>
<P>There was a gracious presence of God with them in their consultations, all that were there with one voice agreeing in many particulars, in respect whereof <HI>Reformation</HI> should be, and must be: <HI>e.g.</HI> <Q>That some effectual course should be taken for the Suppression of those proud Excesses in Ap∣parrrel

hair, &amp;c. which many (yea and the poorer sort as well as others) are shamfully guilty of. That a due testimony should be borne against such as are false Worshippers, especially Idolatrous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> who set up Altars against the Lords Altar, yea who set up a Christ whom the Scrip∣tures know not. That whereas excess in drinking is become a common Sin, meanes should be used to prevent an unnecessary multiplication of Or∣dinaries, and to keep Town dwellers from frequenting Taverns: and that whereas Swearing hath been frequently heard, they that hear another Swear profanely and do not complain of it to Authority, shall be punished for that concealment. Also that some further care should be taken, that the fourth and fifth Commandments be better observed then formerly; and that there may be no more such Oppression, either by Merchants or day-Labourers as heretofore hath been; and that the Indian Trading-houses, whereby the Heathen have been debauched and scandalized against Religi∣on, be suppressed; and that more care should be taken respecting the Rising Generation, then formerly hath been, that they might be brought under the discipline of Christ &amp;c.</Q> These things were unanimously consented to.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 19. The Conclusions of the Committee, respecting <HI>Reformation</HI> of provoking evils were signed, and delivered in to the General Court, who voted acceptance thereof, and appointed another Committer to draw up Laws in order to the establishment of the things agreed on. Now as I re∣member that famous Martyrologist Mr. <HI>Fox</HI> ( in <HI>Acts &amp; Monuments</HI> vol. 2 pag. 669.) observes, with respect to the <HI>Reformation</HI> in K. <HI>Edward</HI> the 6th his dayes, that that very day and hour when the Act for <HI>Reformation</HI> was put in execution at <HI>London,</HI> God gave the <HI>English</HI> signal victory against the <HI>Scots at Museleburrough;</HI> so it was proportionably) with us. For that day when there was a vote passed for the Suppression and Reformation of those manifest evils, whereby the eyes of Gods Glory are provoked amongst us, the Lord gave success to our Forces, who that day encountred with the <HI>In∣dians</HI> at <HI>Hatfield.</HI> The <HI>English</HI> lost but one man in the fight (albeit some that were sent forth as Scouts were killed or Captivated) the Enemy fled before them, and ran into the River, many of them being seen to fall, but night coming on, it was in vain to follow them further. And after that day, the <HI>Western Plantations</HI> had little or no disturbance by them, but lived in quiet∣ness all the Winter. All this notwithstanding, we may say as sometimes the Lords people of old, <HI>the Harvest is past, the Summer is ended, and we are not saved.</HI> The Sword having marched <HI>Eastward,</HI> &amp; <HI>Westward, and North∣ward,</HI> now beginneth to face toward the <HI>South</HI> again.

Hostility. Nevertheless <HI>Philips and Squaw-Sackims</HI> meet when routed by the <HI>English</HI> Forces, were harboured amongst the <HI>Narragansets,</HI> when the Commissioners of the united Colonies sat at <HI>Boston,</HI> in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> end of <HI>Sep∣tember,</HI> one of the <HI>Narraganset Sachims,</HI> and Messengers from other Sa∣chims there, made their appearance in <HI>Boston;</HI> they pretended nothing but good-will to the <HI>English,</HI> and promised that those Enemies of ours, who had burnt so many houses, and committed so many Murders, and had fled to them for refuge, should be delivered up by the latter end of <HI>October.</HI> But when the time prefixed for the surrendry of the <HI>Wompanoags and Squaw∣Sachems Indians</HI> was lapsed, they pretended they could not do as they had in∣gaged at present, but after winter they would do it. In the mean while, when the English had any ingagement with the Indians, wounded Indians came home to the <HI>Narragansets,</HI> especially after the fight at <HI>Hatfield,</HI> Octob. 19th about fourty wounded men were seen crossing the woods towards the <HI>Narragansets:</HI> also some (at least two Indians) from amongst themselves, came to the English, and told them that the <HI>Narragansets</HI> were resolved (if they could) to destroy the English: but they were loth to begin to fall upon them before winter, but in the Spring when they should have the leaves of trees and <HI>Swamps</HI> to befriend them, they would doe it: wherefore it was judged necessary to send out Forces against them, and preparations were made accordingly.</P>
<P>There was some agitation amongst those whom it did concern, where a person suitable for so great a trust might be found as <HI>General;</HI> and that wor∣thy Gentleman <HI>Josiah Winflow</HI> <ABBR><HI>Esq,</HI></ABBR> who succeeds his Father (of blessed me∣mory) as Governour of <HI>Plimouth;</HI> was pitched upon for this Service.</P>
<P>Under his conduct therefore, an Army consisting of at first a thousand, and at last about fifteen hundred men, were sent forth to execute the venge∣ance of the Lord upon the persidious and bloody Heathen. But before they set out, the Churches were all upon their knees before the Lord, the God of Armyes, entreating his favour and gracious success in that undertaking, wherein the welfare of his people was so greatly concerned. This day of Prayer and Humiliation was observed <HI>Decemb.</HI> 2d. when also something hapned intimating as if the Lord were still angry with our Prayers; for this day all the houses in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> were burnt by the Indians.</P>
<P><HI>Decemb.</HI> 8th. The Army set out from Boston. Whilst they were upon this march, an <HI>Indian</HI> whose name was <HI>Peter,</HI> having received some disgust among his Country men, came to the English, and discovered the plotts of the Indians, told where they were, and promised to conduct the Army to them. They were no sooner arrived in the Narraganset Country but they killed and took captive above fourty Indians. Being come to Mr. <HI>Smiths</HI>
<PB REF="000220_0025_0FA36CCDC7969C98"/>
house, they waited some dayes for <HI>Connecticut</HI> Forces. In the mean while party of the enemy did treacherously get into the house of <HI>Jerem Bull</HI>(where was a Garison.) burned the house, and flew about fourteen persons.</P>
<P><HI>Decemb.</HI> 18. <HI>Connecticut</HI> Forces being come, a March toward the enemy was resolved upon: <HI>Peter</HI> Indian having informed that the <HI>Body of Indians</HI> (only <HI>Ninnigret</HI> being one of their old crafty <HI>Sachems,</HI> had with some of his men withdrawn himself from the rest, professing that he would not ingage in a <HI>War</HI> with the English, therefore did he goe into a place more remote) was in a Fort about eighteen miles distant from the place where our Army now was. The next day, although it were the Sabbath, yet, provisions being almost spent by our Souldiers, waiting so long for Connecticut Forces, the Coun∣cill of War resolved to give Battle to the enemy. The English Souldiers played the men wonderfully; the Indians also fought stoutly, but were at last beat out of their Fort, which was taken by the English, There were hundreds of <HI>Wigwams</HI> (or Indian houses) within the Fort, which our Souldiers set on fire, in the which men, women and Children (no man knoweth how many hundreds of them) were burnt to death. Night coming on, a Retreat was founded.</P>
<P>Concerning the number of Indians stain in this Battle, we are uncertain: only some Indians which afterwards were taken prisoners (as also a wretch∣ed English man that apostatized to the Heathen, and fought with them a∣gainst his own Country-men, but was at last taken and executed) confessed that the next day they found three hundred of their fighting men dead in their Fort, and that many men, women and children were burned in their <HI>Wigwams,</HI> but they neither knew, nor could conjecture how many: it is sup∣posed that not less then a thousand Indians Souls perished at that time. <HI>Nin∣nigret</HI> whose men buried the slain, affirmeth that they found twenty &amp; two Indian Captains among the dead bodyes. Of the English there were killed and wounded about two hundred and thirty, whereof only eighty and five persons are dead. But there was a solemn rebuke of Providence at this time, in that six of our Captains were stain, <ABBR><HI>viz,</HI></ABBR> Captain <HI>Johnson</HI> of Roxbu∣ty, Captain <HI>Gardner</HI> of Salem, Captain <HI>Davenport</HI> of Boston (son to that Captain <HI>Davenport</HI> who did great Service in the expedition against the In∣dians in the <HI>Pequod</HI> war, Anno 1637.) Captain <HI>Gallop</HI> of New-London, Cap∣tain <HI>Marshal</HI> of Windsor, Captain <HI>Siely</HI> of Stratford, who dyed of his wounds some dayes after the fight was over. The three Captains first men∣tioned, belonged to <HI>Mattachusets</HI> Colony, the three last to <HI>Connecticut,</HI> of <HI>Plimouth</HI> Colony Captain <HI>Bradford</HI> (one of their faithfull Magistrates, and son of him that was many years Governour there) was sorely wounded, but God had mercy on him, and on his people in him, so as to spare his life and to restore him to some measure of health, albeit the bullet shot into him is
<PB REF="000220_0026_0FA36CCE883A1828"/>
still in his body. 'Also Captain <HI>Goram</HI> of <HI>Barnstable</HI> in Plimouth Colony <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el sick of a seaver whereof he dyed.</P>
<P>Thus did the Lord take away seven Captains out of that Army. Also four <HI>Leintenants</HI> were wounded in that <HI>Fort fight,</HI> so that although the English had the better of it, yet not without solemn and humbling Rebukes of Provi∣dence. At night as the army returned to their Quarters; a great Snow fell, also part of the army missed their way, among whom was the <HI>General</HI> him∣self with his Life-guard. Had the enemy known their advantage, and pur∣sued our Souldiers (and we have since heard that some of the
<HI>Indians</HI> did ear∣nestly move, thatit might be so, but others of them through the over-ruling hand of Providence would not consent) when upon their retreat, they might easily have cut off the whole Army: But God would be more gracious to us. Here then was not only a <HI>Victory,</HI> but also a signal <HI>Preservation,</HI> for which let the Father of mercyes have eternal Glory.</P>
<P>After this God seemed to withdraw from the English, and take part with the enemy. The next day the Indians finding but few English men dead in the Fort amongst their three hundred Indians that were slain, were much troubled and amazed, supposing that no more of ours had been killed; this blow did greatly astonish them, and had the English immediately pursued the Victory begun, in all likelyhood there had been an end of our troubles: but God saw that neither yet were we sit for deliverance. Wherefore <HI>Co∣necticut</HI> Forces withdrew to <HI>Stonington,</HI> and there being so many killed and wounded amongst those that remained in the <HI>Narraganset</HI> Country, also bread for the Souldiers being wanting, by reason the extremity of the wea∣ther was such, as that the Vessels loaden with provision could not reach them; therefore the army lay still some weeks.</P>
<P>In this interval of time, the town of <HI>Mendam</HI> (Which before that had been for saken of its Inhabitants) was burnt down by the Indians.</P>
<P>Now doth the Lord Jesus begin solemnly to fulfilt his word, in <HI>removing Candlesticks</HI> out of their places, because of <HI>Contentions,</HI> and loss of first Love. Surely when those places are destroyed where Churches have been planted, Candlesticks are removed out of their places. But to proceed, When the Army was just upon the Resolve to return home, because provisions were spent, God so ordered, as that a Vessel loaden with Victuals arrived, where∣upon it was determined (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) to pursue the enemy. Only it was thoughter necessary to desist from this pursuit untill <HI>Connecticut</HI> Forces could return and joyn with ours. In the <HI>interim,</HI> a strange sudden <HI>Thaw</HI> hap∣ned in the midst of <HI>January</HI> (when in New-England the season is wont to be extream cold) that the snow melted away in a little time: the like weather hath rarely been known in this Land at that time of they year, albeit some of the first Planters say it was so above fifty years agoe: However this made
<PB REF="000220_0027_0FA36CCFB350B030"/>
wonderfully for the Indians advantage, for now they fled out of the <HI>Narra∣ganset</HI> Country, and whereas they had been sorely straightned and distressed for victuals, now the snow being wasted, they lived upon Ground-nuts.</P>
<P>In fine, the Army pursued them several dayes, overtook some of them, killed and took about seventy persons, were in sight of the main Body of them, and could they have held out to have pursued them but one day longer probably, this unhappy War had then been ended: but the Souldiers were tired with eight dayes March, and (having spent much of their provision whilst waiting for our <HI>Connecticut</HI> Brethren) their bread faild, so as that they were forced to kill horses and feed upon them.</P>
<P>We have often carried it before the Lord as if we would <HI>Reform</HI> our wayes, and yet when it hath come to, we have done nothing: So hath the Lord car∣ried toward us, as if he would deliver us, and yet hath deferred our <HI>Salva∣tion,</HI> as we our selves have delayed <HI>Reformation.</HI></P>
<P>So then <HI>February</HI> 5. The Army returned to <HI>Boston,</HI> not having obtained the end of their going forth. It was easie to conjucture that the <HI>Narragan∣set,</HI> and <HI>Nipmuck,</HI> and <HI>Quabaog,</HI> and <HI>River Indians,</HI> being all come together, and the <HI>Army</HI> returned, they would speedily fall upon the <HI>Frontier Towns.</HI> And some of the Praying <HI>Indians</HI> who had been sent out as Spies, and had been with the <HI>Indians</HI> beyond <HI>Quabaog,</HI> brought intelligence, that a <HI>French Man</HI> that came from <HI>Canady</HI> had been amongst them, animating them against the <HI>English,</HI> promising a supply of <HI>Ammunition,</HI> &amp; that they would come next summer and assist them: also the Indian Spies declared, that there was a de∣signe, within such a time to burn <HI>Lancaster,</HI> which came to pass both as to the time and manner accordingly.</P>
<P>For upon the 10th. day of <HI>February</HI> some hundreds of the <HI>Indians</HI> fell upon <HI>Lancaster,</HI> burnt many of the Houses, kill'd and took Cap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive above forty persons. Mr. <HI>Rowlandson</HI> (the faithful Pastor of the Church there) had his House, Goods, Books, all burned, his Wife, and all his Children led away Captive before the Enemy. Himself (as God would have it) was not at home, whence his own person was delivered, which otherwise (with∣out a Miracle) would have been endangered. Eight man lost their lives, and were stripped naked by the <HI>Indians,</HI> because they ventured their lives to save Mrs. <HI>Rowlandson.</HI></P>
<P>As this good Man returned home (having been at <HI>Boston</HI> to intercede with the Council that something might be done for the safety of that place) he saw his <HI>Lancaster</HI> in flames, and his own house burnt down, not having heard of it till his eyes beheld it, and knew not what was become of the Wife of his bosome, and Children of his Bowels. This was a most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Providence, and hath made me often think on those words, <HI>though Noa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Job and

Within a few dayes after this, certain <HI>Indians</HI> did some mischiefs at <HI>Malbery, Sudbery, Chelmsford.</HI></P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 21. The <HI>Indians</HI> assaulted <HI>Medfield,</HI> and although there were two or three hundred Souldiers there, they burn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> half the Town, killed se∣veral Men, Women, and Children (about eighteen in all) amongst others their Lieutenant <HI>Adams</HI> was slain. And soon after the was killed, his Wife was casually slain by an <HI>English-man,</HI> whose Gun discharged before he was aware, and the Bullet therein passed through the Boards over head, and mor∣tally wounded Lieutenant <HI>Adam's</HI> wife, It is a sign God is angry, when he turns our Weapons against our selves.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 23. A day of Humiliation was attended in the old Meeting-house in <HI>Boston,</HI> but not without much Distraction, because of an Alarm, by reason of rumors, as if the <HI>Indians</HI> were doing mischief within ten miles of <HI>Boston.</HI></P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 25. This night the <HI>Indians</HI> fired seven Houses and Barns in <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ymouth</HI></P>
<P>In the beginning of <HI>March,</HI> another small Army was sent out from <HI>Boston,</HI> under the conduct of that expert Souldier and Commander Major <HI>Savage,</HI> to seek out the Enemy, Connecticut Forces met with ours at <HI>Quabaog,</HI> and they marched together, but not following the direction of the (<HI>Natick</HI> ) <HI>Praying Indians,</HI> who were sent as Pilots, the Army missed their way, and was bewildred in the Woods. On a sudden when they thought on no such thing, a party of <HI>Indians</HI> fired upon them, and killed one man, and wounded Mr. <HI>Gershom Bulkly,</HI> who is Pastor of the Church in <HI>Wethersfield;</HI> whereupon those <HI>Indians</HI> were immediately pursued, who hastened towards <HI>North-Hampton.</HI> The Army following them thither, missed of the main Body of <HI>Indians.</HI> Nevertheless, there was a singular providence of God ordering this matter, for the relief of those <HI>Western Plantations,</HI> which otherwife, in probability had been cut off.</P>
<P>For upon the fourteenth of <HI>March</HI> a multitude of <HI>Indians</HI> fell upon <HI>North Hampton,</HI> broke through their Fortification in three places, burned five hou∣ses, and five barns, and killed four Men, and one Woman: but the Town being full of Souldiers the Enemy was quickly repulsed, with the loss of ma∣ny of their lives.</P>
<P>March the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Mischief was done, and several lives cut off by the <HI>Indians</HI> this day at <HI>Groton</HI> and at <HI>Sadbury<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> An humbling Providence, inas much as many Churches were this day Fasting and Praying.</P>
<P><PB REF="000220_0029_0FA36CD0C8DBD668"/>
<HI>March</HI> 12. This Sabbath eleven <HI>Indians</HI> assaulted Mr. <HI>William Clarks</HI> Mouse in <HI>Plimouth,</HI> killed his Wife, who was the Daughter of a godly Father and Mother that came to <HI>New-England</HI> on the account of Religion, (See <HI>July</HI> 6.) and she her self also a pious and prudent Woman; they also killed her sucking Childe, and knocked another Childe (who was about eight years old) in the head, supposing they had killed him, but afterwards he came to himself again. And whereas there was another Family besides his own, en∣tertained in Mr. <HI>Clarks</HI> house, the <HI>Indians</HI> destroyed them all, root and branch, the Father, and Mother, and all the Children. So that eleven per∣sons were murdered that day, under one roof, after which they set the house on fire. The Leader of these <HI>Indians</HI> was one <HI>Totoson,</HI> a fellow who was well acquainted with that house, and had received many kindness there, it being the manner of those bruitish men, who are only skilful to destroy, to deal worst with those who have done most for them.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 13. The Indians assaulted <HI>Groton,</HI> and left but few houses standing. So that this day also another Candlestick was removed out of its place. One of the first houses that the Enemy destroyed in this place, was the <HI>House of God, h.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> which was built, and set apart for the celebration of the publick Worship of God.</P>
<P>When they had done that, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and blasphemed, and came to Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> (the worthy Pastor of the Church there) his house (which being Fortified, they attempted not to destroy it) and tauntingly, said, <HI>What Will you do for a house to pray in now we have burnt your Meeting-house?</HI> Thus hath the Enemy done wickedly in the Sanctuary, they have burnt up the Syna∣gogues of God in the Land; they have cast fire into the Sanctuary; they have cast down the dwelling place of his name to the Ground. <HI>O God, how long shall the Adversary reproach? shall the Enemy Blaspheme thy Name for ever? Why withdrawest thou thine band, even thy right band<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pluck it out of thy b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>some.</HI></P>
<P><HI>March,</HI> 17. This day the <HI>Indians</HI> fell upon <HI>Warwick,</HI> and burnt it down to the ground, all but one house.</P>
<P><HI>March.</HI> 20. Some of them returned into the <HI>Narraganset</HI> Country, and burnt down the remaining English houses there.</P>
<P>We are now come to the conclusion of the year 1675. which hath been the most troublesome year that ever poor <HI>New-England saw.</HI> What ending the present year shall have, is with God, but it hath a most dolefull begin∣ning.</P>
<P>For <HI>March</HI> 26. 1676. being the <HI>Sabbath-day,</HI> the Indians assaulted <HI>Mal∣bery,</HI> and consumed a great part of the town: after which the inhabitants apprehended themselves under a necessity of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that place which was
<PB REF="000220_0030_0FA36CD18A1A2E80"/>
done accordingly; so that here is another Candlestick removed out of his place. This day also, Captain <HI>Pierce</HI> of <HI>Scituate</HI> with a party of about fifty <HI>English,</HI> and twenty <HI>Indians,</HI> who were Friends to the <HI>English,</HI> pursued a small number of the Enemy, who in desperate subtilty ran away from them, and they went limping to make the <HI>English</HI> believe they were lame, till they had led them into a snare: for suddenly a vast body of <HI>Indians</HI> did encompass them round; so that Captain <HI>Pierce</HI> was slain, and forty and nice <HI>English</HI> with him, and eight (or more) <HI>Indians</HI> who did assist the <HI>English,</HI> and fought bravely in that engagement.</P>
<P>How many of the Enemy fell we know not certainly, only we hear that some <HI>Indians,</HI> which have since been taken by the <HI>English,</HI> confess that Cap∣tain <HI>Pierce,</HI> and those with him killed an hundred and forty of them before they lost their own lives.</P>
<P>Upon this Lords day another sad thing likewife hapned; for near <HI>Spring∣field,</HI> there were eighteen <HI>English-men</HI> riding to the Town, to attend the so∣lemn Worship of God on his Holy day. And although they were Armed, there were seven or eight <HI>Indians,</HI> who lying in Ambuscado, were so bold as to shoot at them. They killed a Man and a Maid that rode behind him, the English being surprised with fear, rode away to save their lives: in the mean while the Indians seized upon two women and Children, and took them away alive, so that here we have cause to think of Joshuahs wards, who said, <HI>O Lord What shall I say When Israel turns their backs before their Enemies?</HI> What shall be said when eighteen English-men well arm'd, fly before seven Indians? This seems to argue something of a divine for saking, and displea∣sure in heaven against us. The next day those Indians were pursued, but when the <HI>English</HI> came in sight those barbarous wretches hasted to run away, but before that they knocked the two Children on the head, as they were sucking their mothers breasts, and then knocked their Mothers on the head: Ne∣vertheless one of them was alive when the souldiers came to her, and able to give an account of what the Indians had told her. Amongst other particulars, they did affirm to her that there was a Body of about three thousand Indians (no doubt but in that they did hyperbolize) near to <HI>Deerfield,</HI> and that they had newly received a great supply of powder from the Dutch at <HI>Albany:</HI> men that worship <HI>Mammon,</HI> notwithstanding all prohibitions to the contra∣ry, will expose their own and and other mens lives unto danger, if they may but gain a little of this worlds good.</P>
<P><HI>March.</HI> 27. Some of the in habitants of <HI>Sudbury,</HI> being alarumed by what the Indians did yesterday to their neighbours in <HI>Malbury,</HI> appre∣hending they might come upon the enemy unawares, in case they should march after them in the night time, they resolved to try what might be done
<PB REF="000220_0031_0FA36CD2481584E0"/>
and that not altogether without success. For towards the morning whilst it was yet dark, they discerned where the Indians lay by their Fires. And such was their boldness, as that about three hundred of them lay all night within half a mile of one of the garison houses in that town where they had done such mischief the day before. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the darkness was such as an English man cou'd not be discerned from an Indian, yet ours being forty in number discharged several times upon the enemy, and (as Indians <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> firce that time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o confess) God so disposed of the bullets that were shot at that time, that no less then thirty Indians were wounded of whom there were four∣teen that dyed several of which had been principal actors in the late bloudy Tragedyes. The fired hard upon the English, but neither killed nor wounded so much as one man in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P><HI>March.</HI> 28. The Indians burnt about thirty Barns, and rear upon fourty dwelling Houses in <HI>Reboboth,</HI> so that thereby the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssipation and des<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lation of that Church is greatly threatned.</P>
<P>The next day they burnt about thirty houses at the town called <HI>Provi∣dence.</HI></P>
<P>In the beginning of <HI>April</HI> they did some mischief at <HI>Chelmsford</HI> and <HI>Ando∣vor,</HI> where a small party of them put the town into a great fright, caused all the people to fly into Garison houses, killed one man, and burnt one house. And to shew what barbarous creatures they are, they exercised cruelty to∣ward dumb creatures. They took a Cow, knocked off one of her horns, cut out her tongue, and so left the poor creature in great misery. They put an horse, ox &amp;c. into an hovil, and then set it on fire, only to shew how they are delighted in exercising cruelty.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 9th, This day being the Lords day, there was an alaram at <HI>Charles∣town, cambridge,</HI> and other towns, by reason that sundry of the enemy were seen at <HI>Billerica,</HI> and (it seemeth) had shot a man there. This week we hear from <HI>Connecticut,</HI> that a party of their souldiers went with many of the <HI>pe∣quods,</HI> and <HI>Monbegins,</HI> and some of <HI>Ninnegrets</HI> Indians, to seek after the ene∣my, and they killed and took captive forty and four Indians without the loss of any of ours: amongst whom were several of their <HI>Chief Captains,</HI> and their great sachem called <HI>Qudnonchet,</HI> who was a principal Ring leader in the <HI>Narraganset</HI> War, and had as great an interest and influence, as can be said of any among the Indians. This great Sachem was pursued into a Ri∣ver by one of <HI>Ninnegret</HI> his men, and there taken. Being apprehended he was carried away to <HI>Stonington,</HI> where the English caused the <HI>liquods</HI> and <HI>Monbegins,</HI> and <HI>Ninnegrets</HI> Indians, to joyn together in Shooting <HI>Quanon∣thet</HI> and cutting off his head, which was sent to <HI>Hartford.</HI> And herein the English dealt wisely, for by this meanes, those three Indian Nations are
<PB REF="000220_0032_0FA36CD309356FE8"/>
become abominable to the other Indians, and it is now their interest to be faithfull to the English, since their own Country-men will never forgive them; on account of their taking and killing the Sachem mentioned: So that there was a gracious smile of providence in this thing, yet not without mat∣ter of humbling to us, in that the Sachem was apprehended not by English but by Indian hands.</P>
<P><HI>April,</HI> 19. The Indians killed a man at <HI>Wrymouth,</HI> and another at <HI>Hing∣ham.</HI> And they burnt down the remaining deserted houses at <HI>Malbery.</HI></P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 20th. A day of Humiliation was observed in <HI>Boston.</HI> The next day sad tidings came to us. For the enemy set upon <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>udbury,</HI> and burnt a great part of the town. And whereas Capt. <HI>Wadsworth</HI> (a prudent &amp; faithful man) was sent out for their relief, with about seventy armed men, a great body of Indians surrounded them, so as that above fifty of ours were slain that day, amongst whom was Capt. <HI>Wadsworth</HI> and his Leiute∣nant <HI>Sharp.</HI> Also Captain <HI>Bra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tlebanck</HI> (a godly and choise spirited mar) was killed at the same time. Also they took five or six of the English and carried them away alive, but that night killed them in such a manner as none but <HI>Salvages</HI> would have done. For they stripped them naked, and caused them to run the G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>untle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, whipping them after a cruel and bloudy manner, and then threw hot ashes upon them; cut out the flesh of their legs, and put fire into their wounds, delighting to see the miserable tor∣ments of wretched creatures. Thus are they the perfect children of the Devill. What numbers the Indians lost in this fight, we know not, onely a Captive since escaped out of their hands, affirms that the Indians said one to another, that they had an hundred and twenty fighting men kill'd this day.</P>
<P>The same day (as is judged fifty) Indians burnt nineteen houses and barns at <HI>Scit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate</HI> in <HI>Plimouth</HI> Colony, but were notably encountred and repelled from doing further mischief by the valor of a few of the inhabitants.</P>
<P><HI>Apr.</HI> 24th, Skulking Indians did some mischief in <HI>Braintry,</HI> but the inha∣bitants received not any considerable damage by them;</P>
<P><HI>April.</HI> 27. A small number of them near <HI>woodcocks</HI> who keeps the <HI>Ordi∣nary</HI> in the roade to <HI>Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oboth,</HI> watched their opportunity and killed his son, and another man, and greatly wounded another of his sons, and shot him∣self through the arm, and then burnt his sons house.</P>
<P>At <HI>Boston</HI> there is a press in order to sending forth another Army to pur∣sue the enemy; for we hear there is a great body of them near <HI>Malbury,</HI> (as his apprehended) of many hundreds.</P>
<P>About this time, in <HI>Conecticut-Colony,</HI> Capt. <HI>Dennison</HI> with sixty Six Vo∣lunteers, &amp; an hundred and twelve <HI>Peqnoa-Indians,</HI> pursuing the common enemy, took and flew seventy and six Indians. Amongst the slain was the
<PB N="28" REF="000220_0033_0FA36CD3C8144490"/>
Sachem <HI>Pomham</HI> his Grand-child, who was also a Sachem, and another Sa∣chem called <HI>Chickon,</HI> and one great Counsellour. They took and spoiled an hundred and sixty bushels of the Indians corn. None of ours either English or Indians that did ingage with and for the English, were lost when this exploit was done.</P>
<P>In the month of <HI>April,</HI> many of the Eastern, Indians having been sorely distressed, and sain to wander up and down for meat, so as that they lived for some time upon no other food then the skins of wild creatures, which they soaked in water till they became soft and eatable, notwithstanding the outrages and murthers (for they have shed the blood of about forty seven persons) by them committed, they did in confidence of favour from the En∣glish come and submit themselves, alleadging that the injuryes done by them were grounded upon a mistake. For when a party of English came in Warlike posture upon some of their <HI>Webbs</HI> (as they call them) <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Wo∣men</HI> as they were gathering corn, an Indian seing it, ran to the other Indi∣ans and told them that the English had (though it were not all so) killed all those Indian women, and therefore they took up arms to revenge that supposed injury. Also they plead for themselves, that a Fisher-man told one of them, that the English would destroy all the Indians, and when in∣quiry was made of another English man (thought to be more discrect then the former) he confirmed what the other had said, and that some rude En∣glish did purposely over set a <HI>Canos</HI> wherein was an Indian Lad; and that al∣though a <HI>Squaw</HI> dived to the bottome of the River and fetched him up alive, yet that the Lad never came to himself again. It is greatly to be lamented that the heathen should have any ground for such allegations, or that they should be scandalized by men that call themselves Christians.</P>
<P><HI>May.</HI> 3d. Was the day of <HI>Election</HI> for Governour and Magistrates in the <HI>Matachusets Colony.</HI> This day the Lord by a wonderfull hand of pro∣vidence, wrought Salvation for <HI>Mrs. Bowlandson</HI> &amp; returned to her to <HI>Boston,</HI> after she had been eleven weeks in Captivity amongst the heathen. This is a Token for good, being a great answer of Prayer. For by reason of her near relation to a <HI>Man of God,</HI> much prayer had been particularly made before the Lord on her behalf. Nevertheless did the Lord manifest his holy dis∣pleasure, in as much as at <HI>Haveril</HI> and <HI>Bradford,</HI> a small company of Indians killed two men and carryed away a man and a woman, &amp; five Children alive.</P>
<P><HI>May.</HI> 6th.

About seventeen Houses and Barns did the <HI>Indians</HI> fire and de∣stroy at <HI>Bridge-water.</HI> About this time they killed four men at <HI>Tannson,</HI> as they were at work in the field, by whose death about thirty Children were made fatherless. But the Lord in the nick of time, sent Thunder and Rain, which caused the Enemy to turn back.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 9. A day of Humiliation by Fasting and Prayer, was attended in the Town-house at <HI>Boston,</HI> by the Magistrates, and Deputies of the General Court, with Assistance of so many teaching Elders as could be obtained. Al|
though many such solemn occasions have at times been attended informer years, yet it hath been observed by some, that God did alwayes signally own his Servants, upon their being before him in such a way and manner: And so it was now; for the very next day after this, a Letter came from <HI>Connecticut</HI> to <HI>Boston,</HI> informing, that God had let loose the <HI>Mohawks</HI> upon our Enemies, and that they were sick of Fluxes, and Fevers, which proved mortal to mul∣titudes of them. And whereas a special request lest before the Lord this day, was, that he would (as a token for good) cause our poor Captives to be returned to us again, and particularly those that were taken from <HI>Haverit</HI> the last week, God gave a gracious and speedy Answer, bringing home those very Captives in particular, and many other, yea at least sixteen of our poor sighing prisoners, who were appointed to death, did the Lord loose and return unto us, within eight weeks after this day, and divers of them within three dayes after this solemn day of Prayer. There are who have dated the turn of Providence towards us in this Colony, and against the Enemy in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wonderful manner, from this day forward: yet some lesser and more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>siderable devastations happened soon after in <HI>Plimouth</HI> Colony. For <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 11. A company of <HI>Indians</HI> assaulted the Town of <HI>Plimouth</HI> eleven Houses and five Barns therein: ten <HI>English-men</HI> were going to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> after the Enemy, and having an <HI>Indian</HI> with them, who was true to the <HI>En∣glish,</HI> he spied a party of <HI>Indians</HI> lying in Ambush, who in probability had otherwise cut off many of them, but the <HI>English</HI> having the opportunity of the first shot, struck down several <HI>Indians,</HI> one of which had on a great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Belt. But he and the other that fell were dragged away, and the <HI>Indians</HI> f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d, when they saw themselves pursued, though but by a few. Nevertheless two dayes after this, they burnt seven Houses and two Burns more in <HI>Pli∣mouth,</HI> and the remaining Houses in <HI>Namasket.</HI></P>
<P><HI>May.</HI> 18. This day that happened which is worthy to be remembred. For at <HI>North-hampton, Hadly,</HI> and the Towns thereabouts, two <HI>English</HI> Captives escaping from the Enemy, informed that a considerable body of <HI>Indians,</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="30" REF="000220_0035_0FA36CD547F118A8"/>
seated themselves not far from <HI>Pacomptuck,</HI> and that they were very secure: so that should Forces be sent forth against them, many of the Enemy would (in probability) be cut off, without any difficulty. Hereupon the Spirits of Men in those Towns were raised with an earnest desire to see and try what might be done. They sent to their neighbours in <HI>Connecticut</HI> for a supply of Men, but none coming, they raised about an hundred and four score out of their own Towns, who arrived at the <HI>Indian Wigwams</HI> betimes in the morning, finding them secure indeed, yea all asleep without having any Scouts abroad, so that out Souldiers came and put their Guns into their Wigwams, before the <HI>Indians</HI> were aware of them, and made a great and notable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aughter amongst them. Some of the Souldiers affirm, that they numbred above one hundred that lay dead upon the ground, and besides those, others told about an hundred and thirty, who were driven into the River, and there perished, being carried down the Falls, <HI>The River Kishon swept them away, that ancient River, the river Kishon, O my soul thou hast troden down strength.</HI> And all this while but one <HI>English-man</HI> killed, and two wounded. But God saw that if things had ended thus; another and not Christ would have had the Glory of this Victory, and therefore in his wise providence, he so disposed, as that there was at last somewhat a tragical issue of this Expedition. For an <HI>English</HI> Captive Lad, who was found in the Wigwams, spake as if <HI>Philip</HI> were coming with a thousand <HI>Indians:</HI> which false report being famed (<HI>Famâ bella stant</HI>) among the Souldiers, a pannick terror fell upon many of them, and they hasted homewards in a confused rout; <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> In the mean while, a party of Indians from an Island (whose coming on shore might easily have been prevented, and the Souldiers before they set out from <HI>Hadly</HI> were earnestly admonished to take care about that matter) assaulted our men; yea, to the great dishonour of the English, a few Indians pursued our Souldiers four or five m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>les, who were in number near twice as many as the Enemy. In this <HI>Disorder,</HI> he that was at this time the chief Captain, whose name was <HI>Turner,</HI> lost his life, he was pursued through a River; received his Fatal stroke as he passed through that which is called the <HI>Green River,</HI> &amp; as he came out of the <HI>Water</HI> he fell into the hands of the <HI>Uncircumcised,</HI> who stripped him, (as some who say they saw it affirm) and rode away upon his horse, and between thirty and forty more were lost in this Retreat.</P>
<P>Within a few dayes after this, Capt. <HI>Turners</HI> dead Corps was found a small distance from the River it appeared that he had been shot through his thigh and back, of which its judged he dyed speedily without any great tor∣ture from the enemy. However it were, it is evident that the English ob∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ed a victory at this time, yet if it be as some Indians have since related, the
<PB N="31" REF="000220_0036_0FA36CD60A553F98"/>
Victory was not so great as at first was apprehended: For sundry of them who were at several times taken after this slaughter, affirm that many of the Indians that were driven down the Falls, got safe on shore again, and that they lost not above threescore men in the fight: also that they killed thir∣ty and eight English men which indeed is just the number missing. There is not much heed to be given to Indian Tellimony, yet when circumstances and Artificial arguments confirm what they say, it becometh an impartial <HI>Historian</HI> to take notice thereof, nor is it to be doubled but the loss of the enemy was greater then those Captives taken by our Forces abroad did acknowledge. Some other Indians said that that they lost several hundreds at this time, amongst whom there was one Sachem. I am informed that diverse Indians who were in that battell, but since come in to the English at <HI>Nor∣mich,</HI> say that there were three hundred killed at that time, which is also confirmed by an Indian called <HI>pombam,</HI> who faith that of that three hundred there were an hundred and seventy fighting men. Whatever the victory or success of that ingagement might be, it was the Lords doing, and let him a∣lone have all the Giory.</P>
<P><HI>May,</HI> 23. Some of our Troopers fell upon a party of Indians (about fifty in number) not far from <HI>Rehoboth,</HI> and flew ten or twelve of them, with the loss of onely one English-man. The Indians betook themselves to a River, and had not some Foot-Souldiers on the other side of the River, too sud∣denly discovered themselves, probably there had been a greater slaughter of the enemy, who hasted out of the river again, and fled into a Swamp where there was no pursuing of them.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 30th. The enemy appeared at <HI>Hatfield,</HI> fired about twelve houses and barns without the Fortification, killed many of their Cattle, drave away almost all their sheep, spread themselves in the meadow between <HI>Hatfield</HI> &amp; <HI>Hadly.</HI> When upon twenty five active and resolute men went from <HI>Hadly</HI> to relieve their distressed Brethren. The Indians shot at them ere they could get out of the Bout &amp; wounded one of them. Ours nevertheless charged on the enemy, shut down five of six at the first volley near the River. Then they made hast toward the town fighting with a great number of the enemy, many falling before them. And though encompassed with a numerous swarm of Indians, who also lay in Ambush behind almost every Tree, and place of ad∣vantage, yet the English lost not one man, till within about an hundred Rod of the Town, when five of ours were slain; among whom was a precious young man, whose name was <HI>Smith,</HI> that place having lost many in losing that one man. It speaketh sadly to the rising Generation when such are ta∣ken away. After this the Enemy fled, having lost five and twenty in this fight.</P>

In these two last months of <HI>May &amp; April,</HI> besides the <HI>Sword of War,</HI> in respect of the Heathen, <HI>the Sword of the Lord</HI> hath been drawn against this Land, in respect of Epidemical Diseases, which sin hath brought upon us; Sore and (doubtless) <HI>Malignant Colds</HI> prevailing every where. I cannot hear of one Family in <HI>New-England</HI> that hath wholly escaped the Distemper, but there have been many Families wherein every one in the House was sick and ill-disposed. So as that there have been many sick and weak, and some are fallen asleep, yea some eminent and useful Instruments hath the Lord re∣moved, and made breaches thereby upon divers of the Colonies <HI>New∣England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Connecticut</HI> is deprived of their Worthy and publick-spirited Governour <HI>Winthrop.</HI> This Colony of <HI>Mattachusets</HI> hath been bereaved of two (<ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> Major <HI>Willard,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Russel</HI>) who for many years had approved them∣selves faithful in the Magistracy. And the death of few such is as much as if thousands had fallen: yet many other righteous and useful ones are gone, leaving us behind in the storm. And amongst the common people, not a few have been carried to their Graves in these two last months. We have heard of no less then eight in one small Plantation, buried in one week, wherein also twenty persons died this spring. And in another little Town nineteen persons have died within a few weeks. We in <HI>Boston</HI> have seen (a sad and solemn spectacle) Coffins meeting one another, and three or four put into their Graves in one day. In the month of <HI>May</HI> about fifty persons are deceased in this Town. By which things, God from Heaven speaks to us and would give us to understand, that if the Sword will not reform us, be hath other Judgements in store, whereby he can suddenly and easily bring us down. The Lord help us to apply our hearts unto Wisdome, and make us thankful, in that he hath been entreated graciously and wonderfully to re∣store Health unto us again.</P>
<P>In the latter end of <HI>May,</HI> and beginning of <HI>June,</HI> the <HI>Indians</HI> have been less-active in the pursuit of their mischievous designes against the <HI>English.</HI> Our reason whereof hath been, in that it was now their Planting and Fishing times for at this time of the year, they supply themselves with fish out of the ponds and Rivers, wherewith this good Land doth abound, and dry it against the Sun so as that they can lay up in store, for to serve them the year about. But it would have been no wisdome for the English to suffer them so to do. Wherefore about four or five hundred souldiers were sent out of this Colony, and as many (<HI>English</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> together) <HI>of Con∣necticut,</HI> to seek out and disrest the Enemy.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 7. Our Forces now abroad came upon a party of Indians not far from <HI>Lancaster,</HI> and killed seven of them, and took nine and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of them
<PB REF="000220_0038_0FA36CD78CF4AE50"/>
Captive: some of which not long lince had English Captives under them. Thus did they that had led into Captivity, go into Captivity; and they that killed with the Sword were themselves killed with the Sword.</P>
<P>Also <HI>Connecticut</HI> Forces, whilst upon their march, killed and took above fifty <HI>Indians:</HI> and not long after that, a small party of <HI>Connecticut</HI> Souldiers with the assistance of a few of those <HI>Indians</HI> who have been friends to the <HI>English,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lew and took forty and four of the Enemy in the <HI>Narraganset</HI> Country; all these exploits being performed without the loss of any of ours.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 12. The Enemy assaulted <HI>Hadly,</HI> in the morning, Sun an hour high, three Souldiers going out of the Town without their Arms, were disswa∣ded therefrom by a Serjeant, who stood at the Gate, but they alleadging that they intended not to go far, were suffered to pass, within a while the Serjeant apprehended, that he heard some men running; and looking over the For∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, he saw <HI>twenty Indians</HI> pursuing those three men, who were so ter∣rified that they could not cry out, two of them were at last killed, and the other so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wounded, as that he lived not above two or three dayes; wherefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Serjeant gave the <HI>Alarme.</HI> God in great mercy to those <HI>Western Plantations</HI> had so ordered by his providence, as that <HI>Connecticut</HI> Army was come thither before this onset from the enemy. Besides En∣glish, there were near upon two hundred Indians in <HI>Hadley,</HI> who came to fight with and for the English, against the common enemy, who quick∣ly driven off at the <HI>South end</HI> of the Town; whilst our men were pursuing of them here, on a sudden a great Swarm of Indians issued out of the bushes, ad made their main assault at the <HI>North end</HI> of the Town, they fired a Barn which was with out the Fortifications, and went into an house, where the inhabitants discharged a great Gun upon them, whereupon about fifty Indi∣ans were seen running out of the house in great haste, being terribly frighted with the Report and slaughter made amongst them by the great Gun. Ours followed the enemy (whom they judged to be about five hundred, and by In∣dian report since, it seems they were seven hundred) near upon two miles, and would fain have pursued them further, but they had no Order so to do. Some in those parts think, that as great an opportunity and advantage as hath been since the war began, was lost at this time, the Lord having brought the enemy to them, had there being English and Indians enough to pursue them: But others supposing that then they should impede the design of com∣ing upon them at the <HI>Falls,</HI> nothing was done untill it was too late, only the Towns in those places were eminently saved, and but few of ours that lost their lives in this skirmish, nor is it as yet known how many the enemy lost in this fight. The English could find but three dead Indians: Yet some of them who have beentaken Captive, confess that they had thirty men kill'd this

day. And since we have been informed by Indians, of that which is much to be observed. <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that while the Indian men were thus fighting against <HI>Had∣ly,</HI> the hand of the Lord so disposed, as that the <HI>Mchawks</HI> came upon their Head-Quarters, and smore their women and Children with a great Slaugh∣tee, and then returned with much plunder. If indeed it was so (and the Indians are under no temptation to report a falshood of this nature) it is a very memorable passage.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 15. This day was seen at <HI>Plimouth</HI> the persect form of an <HI>Indian Bow</HI> appearing in the aire, watch the Inhabitants of that place (at least some of them) look upon as a <HI>Prodigious Apparition.</HI> The like was taken notice of, a little before the Fort Fight in the <HI>Narraganset</HI> Countrey. Who know∣eth but that it may be an <HI>Omen</HI> of ruine to the enemy, and that the Lord will break the bow and spear asunder, and make warrs to cease unto the ends of the earth? Nor is this (may I here take occasion a little to <HI>digress,</HI> in or∣der to the inserting of somethings, hitherto not so much observed, as it may be they ought to be) the first <HI>Prodigy</HI> that hath been taken notice of in <HI>New∣England.</HI> It is a common observation, verifyed by the experience of many Ages, that <HI>great and publick Calamityes seldome come upon any place without Frodigious Warnings to forerun and signify what is to be expected.</HI> I am slow believe Rumors of this nature, nevertheless some things I have had cer∣tain Information of.</P>
<P>It is certain, that before this Warr brake out; <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> on Sept. 10. 1674. In <HI>Hadly, Northampton,</HI> and other Towns there bouts, was heard the report of a great piece of Ordinance, with a thinking of the earth. and a conside∣rable Echo, whenas there was no ordinance really discharged at or ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> any of those Towns at the time.

that have been fiercely assaulted by the Enemy, having obtained help from God, do continue to this day, as brands plucked out of the fire, and as mo∣numents of the sparing mercy of God, although they have been in the fire they are not consumed. And God hath returned many of our <HI>Captives,</HI> having given them to find compassion before them who led them Captive, and caused the Enemy to entreat them well, in the time of affliction, and in the time of evil, and by strange wayes at last delivered them. He hath also sent in a supply of Corn from beyond Sea, this Spring, and before winter; without which we could not easily have sent out such Armies (however small and not worthy of the name of <HI>Armies</HI> in other parts of the World; yet with us they are Armies) as have been pursuing the Enemy. Its wonder∣ful to consider, how that the Lord hath visited his People in giving them Bread, when a Famine was expected. And this Summer, God hath caused the showre to come down in its season, there have been showres of Blessing when some beginnings of a Drought were upon the Land. And sore Dis∣eases hath the Lord rebuked; whereas the <HI>small Pox</HI> and other <HI>Malignant</HI> and <HI>Contagious Distempers</HI> have been amongst us since this <HI>War</HI> began, God hath been entreated to have compassion on us, and to restore health unto his people. Moreover, we are still under the enjoyment of our <HI>Liberties;</HI> both Civil and Spiritual: for such causes as these, the day mentioned was observed (by order of the Council) as a day of publick. Thanksgiving throughout this Colony: And behold, when we began to sing and to praise the Lord whose<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ercy endureth for ever, he hath as it were set Ambush∣ments against the Enemy, and they were smitten, yea they have since that been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>initing and betraying one another.</P>
<P>There are two things here observable:</P>
<P N="1">1. Whereas this very day of the Month (<ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>June</HI> 29.) was kept as a day of publick <HI>Hamiliation</HI> the last year, being the first <HI>Fast</HI> that was ob∣served, in this Colony on the account of the present <HI>War,</HI> God hath so orde∣red, as that the same day of the month was in the year af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> set apart to mag∣nifie his Name on the account of mercies received, being the first publick day of Thanksgiving, which hath been attended throughout this Colony since the <HI>War</HI> began.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Lord from Heaven smiled upon us at this time; for the day before this <HI>Thanks-giving,</HI> as also the day after, he gave us to hear of more of our Captives returned: particularly <HI>Mr. R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wlanás<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns</HI> Children are now brought in as answers of Prayer. It is not a small mercy, that the mother and children (only one childe was killed when the other were taken) should all of them be saved alive, and carried through the Jaws of so many deaths, and at last brought home in peace, that so they and all that even shall hear of
<PB REF="000220_0043_0FA36CDB47BE3550"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and know, that the Lord Jehovah, it a God that heareth prayer. Also the night after this <HI>Thanks-giving,</HI> intelligence came to <HI>Boston,</HI> that a chief <HI>Narraganset Sachim,</HI> is now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uing to the English for peace, and that an Indian was come in to the English near <HI>Reboboth,</HI> who informed that <HI>Philip</HI> was not far off, and that he had but thirty men (besides Women and Chil∣dren) with him; and promised to conduct the English to the place where <HI>Philip</HI> was lu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>king, and might probably be taken; Moreover, the Indian af∣firmed, that those Indians who are known by the name of <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quawogs</HI> (or Mohawas) <HI>i.e.</HI> Man eaters) had lately fallen upon <HI>Philip,</HI> and killed fifty of his men. And if the variance between <HI>Philip</HI> &amp; the <HI>Mauquawags</HI> c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me to pass, as is commonly reported &amp; apprehended, there was a marvelous finger of God in it. For we hear that <HI>Philip</HI> being this winter entertained in the <HI>Mohawks</HI> Country, Made it his design to breed a quarrel between the English &amp; them; to effect which divers of our returned Captives do report that he resolved to kill some scattering <HI>Mohawks,</HI> &amp; then to say that the English had done it: but one of those whom he thought to have killed, was only wounded, and got away to his Country men giving them to understand, that not the English but <HI>Philip</HI> had killed the Men that were Murdered, so that instead of bring∣ing the <HI>Mohawks,</HI> upon the English, he brought them upon himself. Thus hath he conceived mischief and brought forth falshood, he made a pit and digged it, and is fallen into the di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch which he hath made, his mischief shall and return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate. The Heathen are sunk down into the pit that they made, in the net which they had bid, is their own foot taken; the Lord is known by the Judgment which he executeth, the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. <HI>Higgaion.</HI> Selah.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 30. This day Souldiers marched out of <HI>Boston</HI> towards the place, where <HI>Philip</HI> was supposed to be. But when they come thither, they found that he was newly gone. We hear that he is returned to <HI>Mount hop;</HI> and that a considerable body of Indians are gathered to that place, where the <HI>War</HI> began, and where (it may be) way must be made towards an end of these troubles. Yet who knoweth how cruelty a <HI>dying B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re before his expiration? Also <HI>Plimouth</HI> Companies being abroad under the conduct of Major <HI>Bradford,</HI> the Lord went forth with them, this day cau∣sing the enemy to fall before them. They were in danger of being cut off by party of Indians who lay in Ambush for that end, but some of the <HI>Cape-Indians,</HI> who have been faithful to the English, discovered the <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rata∣gems</HI> of the Adversary, whereby their intended mischief was happily pre∣vented. Divers of them were killed and taken, without the loss of so much as one of ours. And whereas, three Messengers from <HI>Squaw-Sachem</HI> of
<PB REF="000220_0044_0FA36CDC0A45BAF0"/>
<HI>Sak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>net,</HI> were gone to the <HI>Governour of Plimouth</HI> offering to submit them∣selves, and engaging Fidelity to the English for the future, if they might but have a promise of life, and liberty; before the Messengers returned from their treaty, that <HI>Squaw-Sachem</HI> with about <HI>ninety</HI> persons, hearing that <HI>Plimouth</HI> Forces were approaching to them, came and tendred themselves to Major <HI>Bradford,</HI> wholly submitting to mercy, so that this day were killed, taken and brought in no less then <HI>an hundred and ten Indians.</HI> And the providence of God herein is the more observable, in that the very day be∣fore this, the Lords People in <HI>Plimouth</HI> did unanimously consent to renew their Covenant with God, and one another, and a day of Humiliation was appointed for that end that so a work so sacred and awful might be attended with the more solemnity: also in the week before these signal smiles from Heaven upon that <HI>Colony,</HI> most of the Churches there, had <HI>renewed their Covenant,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> on the day of <HI>Humiliation</HI> which was last attended through∣out that Jurisdiction. God then faith unto us, that if we will indeed hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ken unto his voice, the haters of the Lord shall soon submit themselves.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 8. Whereas the Council at <HI>Boston</HI> had lately emitted a Declaration, signifying, that such Indians as did within fourteen dayes come into the En∣glish, might hope for mercy, divers of them did this day return from a∣mong the <HI>Ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mucks.</HI> Amongst others, <HI>James</HI> an Indian, who could not only reade, and write, but had learned the Art of Printing, notwithstanding his Apostafie, did venture himself upon the mercy and truth of the English Declaration which he had seen and read, promising for the future to venture his life against the common Enemy. He and the other now come in, affirm that very many of the Indians are dead since this <HI>War</HI> began; and that more have dyed by the hand of God, in respect of Diseases, Fluxes, and Feavers, which have been amongst them, then have been killed with the Sword.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 2. This day <HI>Connecticut</HI> Forces being in the <HI>Narraganset</HI> Country met with a party of Indians, pursued them into a Swamp, killed and took <HI>an hundred and fourscore</HI> of them (amongst whom was the old <HI>Squaw Sa∣chem of Narraganset</HI>) without the loss of one English-man. Only an In∣dian or two that fought for the English, was killed in this engagement. The English would gladly have gone further, and have joyned with <HI>Boston</HI> and <HI>Plimouth</HI> Companies to pursue <HI>Philip</HI> at <HI>Mount-hope,</HI> but the <HI>Connecticut</HI> In∣dians would by no means be perswaded thereunto, until such time as they had returned home with the booty they had taken. And as they were on their march homeward, they <HI>took</HI> and slaught<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red <HI>threescore</HI> more <HI>Indians.</HI> In the mean while the other Colonyes are sending out souldiers towards <HI>Mount-Hope,</HI> where <HI>Philip</HI> with a multitude of Indians lately flocked thither is reported to be, designing speedily to fall upon the neighbouring Towns.</P>
<P><PB REF="000220_0045_0FA36CDCC7DE7EF0"/>
<HI>July.</HI> 6. Five or six Indian <HI>Sachems</HI> did make peace with the English in the Eastern parts of this Colony. They have brought in with them three hun∣dred men besides women and Children. One of the <HI>Sachims</HI> did earnestly de∣fine, that the English would promise that no more <HI>liquors</HI> should be sold or given to the <HI>Indians,</HI> that so they might not be in a Capacity of making them∣selves drunk, having found by wofull experience, that that hath been a ruining evill to many of them. This week also about <HI>two hundred Indians</HI> more came &amp; submitted themselves to mercy, in <HI>Plimouth Colony,</HI> being partly necessitated thereunto by the distresses which God in his holy providence hath brought them into, and partly encouraged by a promise from the Goverment there, that all such Indians; as would come in, and lay down their armes should have life and liberty granted to them, expecting only such as had been active in any of the murthers which have been committed. When these Indians were in the hands of the English, a certain <HI>Squaw</HI> amongst them, preceiving that it would be pleasing to the English, if the murderers were discovered, she presently told of one who had had a bloudy hand in the murthers which were done in Mr. <HI>Clarks</HI> house <HI>March</HI> the twelfth, the Indian immediately confessed the Fact, only said that there was another who had as great an hand therein as he, which other Indian being examined, confessed; the thing also; and he revealed a third Indian Murderer, who upon Examination owned the thing, whereupon they were all three forthwith executed, thus did God bring upon them the innocent blood which they had shed. Also the Indians who had surrendred themselves, informed that a bloody Indian called <HI>Tuckpoo</HI> (who the last summer murdered a Man of <HI>Boston</HI> at <HI>Namasket</HI>) with about <HI>twenty Indians</HI> more, was at a place within 16 miles of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> and manifested willingness to go and fetch him in, whereupon eight English with fourteen Indians, marched out in the night, and seized upon them all, none of ours receiving any hurt at this time. Justice was speedily executed upon the Indian, who had been a Murderer; the other having their lives granted them.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 7. A small party of our Indians having some English with them, took and killed seven of the Enemy in the Woods beyond <HI>Ded<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>am,</HI> whereof one was a petty <HI>Sachem.</HI> The two Indians which were then taken Prisoners, say that many of their men who were sent to <HI>Albany</HI> for a supply of Powder, were set upon in the way by the <HI>Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>awks,</HI> and killed. It is certain, that a∣bout this time, some of those <HI>Indians</HI> who are in <HI>Hostility</HI> against the En∣glish (amongst whom the <HI>Sachim of Springfield</HI> Indians, was one) came to <HI>Albany,</HI> to buy powder, and that they might effect their designe, they lyed and said, that now they had made peace with the English, and desired Pow∣der only to go an hunting in the Woods: we hear, that the other Indians

were is desirous to have slain them, but the Governour of <HI>New-York</HI> se∣cured them, and gave notice to the Council at <HI>Hartford:</HI> since that we have intelligence that many of our enemies, yea and such as have been not<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>s Murderers, are fed for refuge to those about <HI>Albany.</HI></P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 11. A Party of Indians (is conjectured that there were about two hundred of them) assaulted <HI>Taunton.</HI> And in probability, that Town had at this time been brought under the same desolation other places have expe∣rienced, had not the Lord in his gracious providence so ordered, that a Cap∣tive <HI>Negro,</HI> the week before escaped from <HI>Philip</HI> and informed of his purpose speedily to destroy <HI>Taunton,</HI> whereupon Souldiers were forthwith sent thi∣ther, so that the enemy was in a little time repulsed, and fled, after they had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red two Houses: but not one English Life was lost in this Ingagement. What loss the enemy sustained is as yet unknown to us. There were a special providence in that <HI>Negroes</HI> escape, for he having lived many years near to the <HI>Indians,</HI> understood their Language, and having heard them tell one ano∣ther what their designs were, be acquainted the English there with and now <HI>Philip</HI> had ordered his men to lye in <HI>Ambus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> such and such places, to cut of the English, who by meanes of this intelligence escaped that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anger, which other wise had attended them.</P>
<P>About this, time we hear that there are three hundred <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>s</HI> who have armed themselves, as being desirous to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>evenged upon those J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> is who have done so much harm to <HI>New-England</HI> (if they receive no discouragement as to their designed Expedition) And that they purpose to <HI>color</HI> their heads and make them <HI>yellow,</HI> that so they may not upon their ap∣proach to any of our Plantations, be mistaken for <HI>Indians.</HI></P>

At that time did the English take and kill about seventy persons: since an Indian that came into <HI>Rhode-Island,</HI> informeth, that <HI>Philip</HI> is gone to a Swamp near <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtmouth:</HI> and that when our Forces were pursuing of him, he with a few hid himself in <HI>Squanakunk</HI> Swamp, till our Souldiers were past, and then with one Indian in a <HI>Canoo</HI> crost the river to <HI>Pocasset.</HI> It seems the body of the Indians belonging to him, went over on two Rafts, in which pass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge they lost several Guns, and wet much of their Ammunition. The reason why <HI>Philip fled</HI> to this place, was because if he went <HI>Northward,</HI> the <HI>Moha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ks</HI> would be upon him, if <HI>Southward</HI> he was in danger of the <HI>Monhegins,</HI> and he dirst not hide himself any longer about <HI>Metapoisit,</HI> because the Woods thereabouts were filled with Souldiers. This week also, Captain <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Plimo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th,</HI> with a small party consisting of about eighteen English, and two and twenty Indians, had four several engagements with the Enemy, and kil∣led and took Captive seventy nine Indians, without the loss of so much as one of ours; it having been his manner, when he taketh any Indians by a promise of favour to them, in case they acquit themselves well, to set them an hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing after more of these Wolves, whereby the worst of them, some∣times do singular good service in finding out the rest of their bloody fellows.

They came within two miles of the place where <HI>Philip</HI> hideth himself, and discerned at a distance about fifty Indians with Guns, thought to be <HI>Philips</HI> Hunters for Provision, and were desirous to have engaged with them, but being loaden with Cap∣tives and Plunder, they could not then attend it. Also a <HI>Sachem</HI> of <HI>Pocasset</HI> hath submitted himself with fourty Indians more, to the Governour of <HI>Ply∣mouth.</HI> So that there is of late such a strange <HI>turn of providence</HI> (especially in <HI>Plimouth</HI> Colony, since the Churches in that Colony (being thereunto provoked by the godly advice and Recommendation of the civil Authority in that Jurisdiction) did solemnly <HI>renew their Cov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ant with G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> another</HI> ) as the like hath rarely been he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d of in any age. Whereas formerly almost every week did conclude with sad tydings, now the Lord sends us good news weekly. Without doubt, there are in the World who have been praying for us, and God hath heard them.

having nine of the <HI>Praying Indians</HI> with them, pursued and overtook a party of the Enemy, killed and took alive fifty of them, without the loss of any of ours. The nine Indians stored themselves with plunder when this exploit was done: For besides Kettles, there was about half a Bushel of <HI>Wampampeag,</HI> which the Enemy lost, and twelve pound of Powder, which the Captives say they had received from <HI>Albany,</HI> but two dayes before. At this time, another of the <HI>Narraganset Sachims</HI> was killed, whose name was P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> and his Son was taken alive, and brought Prisoner to <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ston.</HI> This <HI>Pomham</HI> after he was wounded so as that he could not stand upon his legs, and was thought to have been dead, made a shift (as the Souldiers were pur∣suing others) to crawl a little out of the way, but was found again, and when an <HI>English-man</HI> drew near to him, though he could not stand, he did (like a dying Beast) in rage and revenge, get hold on that Souldiers head, and had like to have killed him, had not another come in to his help, and res∣cued him out of the inraged dying hands of that bloody <HI>Barbarian,</HI> who had been a great promoter of the <HI>Narraganset War.</HI></P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 27. One of the <HI>Nipmuck Sachims</HI> (called Sagamore <HI>John</HI>) ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to Boston, and submitted himself to the mercy of the <HI>English,</HI> bringing in about <HI>an hundred and fourscore Indians</HI> with him. And that so he might in∣gratiate himself with the <HI>English,</HI> he apprehended <HI>Matoo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s</HI> and his Son, and brought them with him to <HI>Boston,</HI> which <HI>Matoo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s</HI> was the beginner of the <HI>War</HI> in this Colony of <HI>Massachnsets;</HI> for it was he that committed the mur∣ders which were done at <HI>Mendam July</HI> 14. 1675. Being thus taken and examined before the Council, he had little to plead for himself, and therefore was condemned to immediate death. S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gamore <HI>John</HI> was desirous that he and his men might be the Executioners; wherefore <HI>Matoonas</HI> was carried out into the Common <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Boston, and there being tied to a Tree, the <HI>Sachi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> who had no submitted himself, with several of his men, shot him to death. Thus did the Lord (a year after) retaliate upon him the Innocent blood which he had shed, as he had done so God hath required him: And inas∣much as <HI>Matoonas</HI> who began the War and Mischiefs which have followed thereon, in this Colony of <HI>Massachusets</HI> is taken, and Justice glorified upon him, it seems to be a good <HI>Omen,</HI> that are long <HI>Philip</HI> who began the <HI>War</HI> in the other Colony, shall likewise e delivered up unto Justice.

<P><HI>July</HI> 31. A small party of Souldiers, whose hearts God had touched, mar∣ched out of <HI>Bridgewater,</HI> in order to pursuing the Enemy. And (about 3 p.m.) not far from <HI>Tetignot River,</HI> they unexpectedly to themselves, and un∣discerned by the Enemy, came upon a company of Indians, amongst whom

<HI>Philip</HI> himself was, though his being there was not known to our men, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the engagement was over. They shot' down ten Indians, they were well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>med, and at first snapped their Guns at the English, but not one of them took fire, wherefore, the terrour of God fill upon the Indians, that fifteen of them threw down their Guns, and submitted themselves to the English, the rest fled, <HI>Philip</HI> himself esc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ped very narrowly with his life.

One Souldiers took above twenty pound of Bullets, and Lead, and seven Guns, five of which were loaden and primed: yea they took the chief of <HI>Philips Treasure,</HI> not being able to carry away all their Plunder that day, for they found much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> goods which <HI>Philip</HI> had stolen. <HI>Philip</HI> made his escape with these men, one of which was killed. And although be himself got clear, yet, his Uncle whose name was <HI>Uncompoen,</HI> being one of his chief Councellors was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>in, and <HI>Philips</HI> own filter was taken Prisoner, not so much as one En∣glish man received any hurt at this time. Thus did God own <HI>Bridgewater,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the People therein had subscribed with their hands, and solemoly re∣newed their holy Conenant with God, and one another, that they would re∣form those evils which were amongst them, and endeavour for the future, to walk more according to the will of God in Jesus Christ.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 1.

In probability, many of the English Souldiers had been cut off at this time, but that an Indian called <HI>Matibias,</HI> who fought for the En∣glish, when they were come very near the Enemy, called to them in their own Language with much vehemency, telling them they were all dead men if they did but fire a God, which did so amuse and amaze the Indians that they lost a great advantage against the English. <HI>Philips</HI> hardly escaped with his life this day also: He fled and left his <HI>Peag</HI> behind him, also his <HI>Squaw and his Son were taken Capti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es,</HI> and are now P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isoners in <HI>Plimouth.</HI> Thus hath God brought that grand Enemy into great misery before be quite des<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roy him.

<P><HI>August</HI> 3. This day the Lord smiled upon this Land by signal favour, in another respect which concerns not the present War. For whereas in the month of <HI>July,</HI> there had been a fore Drought, which did greatly threaten

the Indian Harvest, God opened the bottles of Heaven <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it to rain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this night, and the day after, so as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Indian <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, the English Harvest being already gathered in and more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> then in some former years, insomuch that this which was expected to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> year of Famine, is turned to be a year of plenty as to provision.</P>
<P>Whilst I am writing this, good information is brought to me, that in some parts of <HI>Connecticut</HI> Colony, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and all his men continue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> able Teacher of the Church in <HI>Norwich</HI>) desiring that he would pray to God for rain. Mr. <HI>Fitch</HI> replyed to him, that it he should do so and God should hear him, as long as their <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> were at work they would ascribe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to them, and think that the Devill, whome the Indians worship, and not God had sent that rain, and therefore he would not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> till they had done with their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> declared that they had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> despairing to obtain what they desi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed.

<P><HI>August</HI> 6. An Indian that deserted his Fellows informed the inhabitaness of <HI>Taunton</HI> that a party of Indians who might be easily surprised, were not very far off and promised to conduct any that had a mind to apprehend those Indians, in the right way towards them; whereupon about twenty Souldiers marched out of <HI>Taunton,</HI> and they took all those Indians) being in number thirty and six only the <HI>Squaw-Sachem of Pacasset,</HI> who was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> unto <HI>Philip</HI> in respect of the mischief that hath been done, and the blood that hath been shed in this Warr, escaped alone; butnot long after some of <HI>Taunton</HI> finding an Indian Squaw in <HI>Metapoiset</HI> newly dead, cut off her head, and it hapned to be <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> i.e. <HI>Squaw-Sachem</HI> her <HI>head.</HI> When it was set upon &amp; pole in <HI>Taunton,</HI> the Indians who were personers there, knew it presently, and made amongst <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and diabolical Lamentation, crying out;

it was their Queens head. Now here it is to be observed, that God himself by his own hand, brought this enemy to destruction. For in that place, where the last year, she furnished <HI>Philip</HI> with Canooes for his men. She her self could not meet with a Canoo, but venturing over the River upon a Raft, that brake under her, so that she was drowned, just before the English sound her. Surely <HI>Philips</HI> turn will be next.</P>
<P><HI>August.</HI> 10. Whereas <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a chief Counsellor to the old Squaw-Sa∣chem of <HI>Narraganset,</HI> was by some of Road-Island brought into <HI>Boston,</HI> and found guilty of promoting the War against the English, he was this day shot to death in the Common at <HI>Boston.</HI> As he was going to his execution, some told him that now he must dy, he had as good speak the truth, and say how many Indians were killed at the Fort-Fight last winter. He replyed, that the English did that day kill above seven hundred fighting men, and that three hundred who were wounded, dyed quickly after, and that as to old men, women and Children, they had lost no body could tell how many, and that there were above three thousand Indians in the Fort, when our Forces assaulted them, and made that notable slaughter amongst them.</P>
<P><HI>August.</HI> 12. This is the memorable day wherein <HI>Philip,</HI> the perfidious and bloudy Author of the War and wofull miseryes that have thence ensued, was taken and stain. And God brought it to pass, chiefly by Indians them∣selves. For one of <HI>Philips</HI> men (being disgusted at him, for killing an Indian who had p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pounded an expedient for peace with the English) ran away from him, and coming to Road-Island, informed that <HI>Philip</HI> was now re∣turned again to <HI>Mount-Hope,</HI> and undertook to bring them to the Swamp where he hid himself. Divine Providence so disposed, as that Capt. <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Plymouth</HI> was then in Road-Island, in order to recruiting his Souldiers, who had been wearied with a tedious march that week, But immediately upon this Intelligence, he set forth again, with a small company of English and Indians. It seemeth that night <HI>Philip</HI> (like the man, in the Host of <HI>Mi∣dian</HI>) dreamed that he was fallen into the hands of the English; and just as he was saying to those that were with him, that they must fly for their lives that day; left the Indian that was gone from him should discover where he was; Our Souldiers came upon him, and surrounded the <HI>Swamp</HI> (where he was seven of his men absconded) Thereupon he betook himself to flight; but as he was coming out of the Swamp, an English-man and an Indian endea∣voured to fire at him, the English-man missed of his aime, but the Indian shot him through the heart, so as that he fell down dead. The Indian who thus killed <HI>Philip,</HI> did formerly belong to Squaw-Sachim of <HI>Pocasset,</HI> being known by the name of <HI>Alterman.</HI> In the beginning of the war, he came to the Governour of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> manifesting his desire to be at peace with the
<PB N="47" REF="000220_0052_0FA36CE2091FBD38"/>
English, and immediately withdrew to an Island, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> having ingaged against the English nor for them, before this time. Thus when <HI>Philip</HI> had made an end to deal treacherously, his own Subjects dealt treacherously with him. This Wo was brought upon him that spoyled when he was not spoyled. And in that very place where he first contrived.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his mischief, was be taken and destroyed, and there was he (the as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> before the Lord) cut into four quarters, and is now hanged up as a monu∣ment of revenging Justice, his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> being cut off and carried away to Pli∣mouth, his Hands were brought to <HI>Boston. So lot all shine Enemies perish, O Lord!</HI> When <HI>Philip</HI> was thus slain, five of his men were killed with him, one of which was his chief Captains son, being (as the Indians <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> very Indian, who shot the first gun at the English when the War began. So that we may hope that the War in those parts will dye with <HI>Philip.</HI></P>
<P>A little before this, the Authority in that Colony had appointed the seven∣teenth of this instant to be observed as a day of <HI>publick, Thanksgiving</HI> throughout that Jurisdiction, on the account of wonderful success against the Enemy, which the Lord hath blessed them with, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>their Covenant</HI> with him; and that so they might have hearts raised and en∣larged in ascribing praises to God, he delivered <HI>Philip</HI> into their hands a few dayes before their intended Thanksgiving. Thus did God break the head of that Leviathan, and gave it to be meat to the people inhabiting the wil∣derness, and brought it to the Town of <HI>Plimouth</HI> the very day of their So∣lemn Festival: yet this also is to be added and considered, that the Lord (so great is the divine faithfulness) to prevent us from being hited up with our successes, and that we might not become secure, so ordered as that not an <HI>English-man</HI> but an <HI>Indian</HI> (though under <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> influence) must have the honour of killing <HI>Philip.</HI> And the day before this, was intended with a doleful Tragedy in the Eastern parts of this Country; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> at <HI>Falmouth in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> where some of those treacherous and bloody Indians who had lately submitted themselves, and promised Fidelity to the English, killed and took Captive above thirty Souls. The chief Author of this mischief, was an Indian called <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> who was once in the hands of the English, and then known to have been active in former Murders, having bragged and boasted of the mischief and murders done by him. we may fear, that God, who so awfully threatens <HI>Ahab,</HI> when he had let go out of his hand a Blaspha mous, Murderous Heathen, whom the Lord had devoted to destruction, was not well pleased with the English for concluding this, and other bloody Murde∣rers, in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Eastern peace. What the issue of this new flame thus break∣ing forth, shall be, or how far it shall proceed; is with him whose wisdom is infinite; and who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all things well inasmuch as is is too evident that a

Grace of Christ hath alwayes made exemplary in works of that nature) been unwilling to consider their poor Brethren according to their Ability.</P>
<P>To <HI>Conclude</HI> this <HI>History,</HI> it is evident by the things which have been ex∣pressed, that our deliverance is not as yet perfected for the <HI>Nipmuck</HI> Indi∣ans are not yet wholly subdued: Moreover, it will be a difficult thing, either to subdue, or to come at the <HI>River Indians,</HI> who have many of them with∣drawn themselves, and are gone far westward, and whilst they and others that have been in hostility against us, remain unconquered, we cannot enjoy such perfect peace as in the years which are past. And there seems to be a dark Cloud rising from the East, in respect of Indians in those parts, yea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Cloud which streameth forth blood. But that which is the saddest thought of all, is; that of late some unhappy scandals have been, which are enough to stop the current of mercy, which hath been flowing in upon us, and to pro∣voke the Lord to let loose more Enemies upon us, so as that the second error shall be worse then the first. Only God doth deliver for his own Names sake: the Lord will not for sake his people for his great Names sake; because it hath pleased the Lord to make us his people. And we have rea∣son to conclude that <HI>Salvation is begun,</HI> and in a gracious measure carried on towards us. For since last <HI>March</HI> there are two or 3000. <HI>Indians</HI> who have been either killed, or taken, or submitted themselves to the English. And those, <HI>Indians</HI> which have been taken Captive; (&amp; others also, inform that the <HI>Nar∣ragansets</HI> are in a manner ruined, there being (as they say) not above an hun∣dred men left of them, who the last year were the greatest body of Indians in <HI>New-England,</HI> and the most formidable Enemy which hath appeared against us. But God hath consumed them by the Sword, &amp; by Famine and by Sick∣ness, it being no unusual thing for those that traverse the woods to find dea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Indians up and down, whom either Famine, or sickness, hath caused to dy, and there hath been none to bury them. And <HI>Philip</HI> who was the <HI>Sheba,</HI> that began &amp; headed the Rebellion, his head is thrown over the wall, there∣fore have we good reason to hope that this <HI>Day of Trouble,</HI> is near to an end, if our sins doe not undoe all that hath been wrought for us. And indeed there is one sad consideration, which may cause humble tremblings to think of it, namely in that the <HI>Reformation</HI> which God expects from us it not so hearty and so perfect as ought to be. Divines observe, that whereas upon <HI>Samuels Exhortations,</HI> the people did make but imperfect work of it, as to the <HI>Reformation</HI> of provoking evills, therefore God did only begin their deliverance by <HI>Samuel,</HI> but left scattered <HI>Philistines</HI> unsubdued, who after∣wards made head and proved a sore scourge to the Children of Israel; untill <HI>Davids</HI> time, in whose Reign there was a full Reformation, and then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Lord give unto his peope full deliverance. Nevertheless a sad <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB REF="000220_0055_0FA36CE447F31860"/>
wil attend those that shall magnifie themselves against the people of the Lord of Hosts. It hath been observed by many, that never any (whether Indi∣ans of others) did set themselves to do hurt to <HI>New-England,</HI> but they have come to lamentable ends at last. <HI>New-England</HI> hath been a burthensome stone, all that have borthened themselves with it, have been cut in pieces. The experience of the persent day, doth greatly confirm that observation, and give us ground to hope, that as for remaining enemies, they shall fare as others that have gone before them, have done. Yet this further must needs be acknowledged, that as to <HI>Victoryes</HI> obtained, we have no cause to glory in any thing that we have done, but rather to be ashamed and con∣founded for our own wayes. The Lord hath thus far been our Saviour for his Names take, that it might not be profaned among the Heathen whither he hath brought us. And God hath let us sea that he could easily have destroyed us, by such a contemptible enemy as the Indians have been in our eyes; yea he hath convinced us that we our selves could not subdue them. They have advantages that we have not, knowing where to find us, but we know not where to find them, who nevertheless are alwayes at home, and have in a manner nothing but their lives and souls (which they think not of) to loose; every Swamp is a Castle to them, and they can live comfortably on that which would starve English-men. So that <HI>we have no cause to glory,</HI> for it is God which hath thus saved us, and not we our selves. If we con∣sider the time when the enemy hath fallen, we must needs own that the Lord hath done it. For we expected (and could in reason expect no other) that when the Summer was come on, and the bushes and leaves of trees come forth, the enemy would do ten times more mischief then in the winter season, whenas since that, the Lord hath appeared against them, that they have done but little hurt comparatively. Had there not been, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> a di∣vine hand beyond all expect ation manifested, we had been in a state most miserable this day. Aslo if we keep in mind the means and way where∣ly our deliverance hath thus been accomplished, we must needs own the Lord in all. For it hath not been brought to pass by our numbers, or skill, or vabour, <HI>we have not got the Lord in Possession by our own Sword, neither did our own arm save <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</HI> But God hath wasted the Heathen. by sending he de∣stroying Angell amongst them, since this War began; and (which should al∣wayes be an humbling consideration unto us) much hath been done towards the subduing of the enemy, by the Indians who have fought for us, some∣times more then by the English. And no doubt but that a great reason why many of them have, of late been desirous to submit themselves to the English, hath been, because they were afraid of the <HI>Mohawgs</HI> who have a long time been a Terror to the other Indians. I have received it from one
<PB REF="000220_0056_0FA36CE507E88170"/>
who was returned out of Captivity this Summer, that the Indians where he was, would not suffer any fires to be made in the might, for fear left the <HI>Mohawgs</HI> should thereby discern where they were, and not them off.</P>
<P>Now, as the Lord, who doth redeem Israel out of all his troubles, hath graciously and gloriously begun our Salvation, so let him perfect it, in such a way, as that no honour at all may come unto us, but that great glory may be to his own blessed Name for ever. Let him bring health and cure unto this <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and reveal the abundance of peace and truth: And it shall be unto him a Name of joy, a Praise and an honour before all the Nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that he will doe unto us, and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness, and for all the prosperity that he will procure. If wee hearken to his voice in these his solemn Dispensations, it surely shall be so. <HI>Not unto us O Lord; not unto us, but unto thy Name give Glory for thy mercy and for thy Truths sake, Amen!</HI></P>

<P>Since I wrote the preceding Narrative, I hear that there are who make a scruple of using the word <HI>Army,</HI> when applied to such in∣considerable <HI>Forces,</HI> as those which have been raised and sent forth by us, in the late War. I pretend not to any skill or accuracy of speak∣ing as to modern platforms of <HI>Military Dissipline;</HI> but sure I am that of old, a few <HI>Cohorts</HI> being under the command of a chief Captain, though in all there were not above four or five hundred souldiers, this was called <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> an <HI>Army,</HI> Acts, 23,27.

<P>And Reason faith, that those <HI>Forces</HI> may pass for <HI>Armies</HI> in one part of the world, that will not do so In another. But my design in this <HI>Postscript</HI> is not to Criticize or Apologize about the use of a Term. There is another mat∣ter of greater importance, so. <HI>That which doth concern the the Grounds of this Warr, and the justness of it on our part:</HI> concerning which I shall here adde a few words. It is known to every one, that the <HI>War</HI> began not amongst us in <HI>Mattachusets</HI> Colony; nor do the Indians (so far as I am informed) pre∣tend that we have done them wrong. And therefore the cause on our part is most clear, and unquestionable: For if we should have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our Con∣federates, and those that were ready to be slain, to be draws, to death, &amp; not have endeavoured to deliver them, when they sent unto us for that end, the Lord would have been disoleased; nor should we have acted like the Children of Abraham, Geo. 14. 14. Yea, all the world would justly have condemned us. And as for our Brethren in that Colony, where these tumults first hapned,'
<PB REF="000220_0058_0FA36CE688AA8950"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that the Indians did most unrighteously begin a Quarrel, and take up the Sword against them.</P>
<P>I said at the beginning. I would not inlarge upon that Argument, which concerns the <HI>Grounds of the Warr,</HI> neither will I, because that would make the <HI>History</HI> too voluminous, contrary to my design. Nevertheless, inasmuch as some are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thereabouts, so as to receive impressions and prejudi∣ces in their minds, concerning our Brethren in <HI>Plymouth</HI> Colony (as it is na∣tural for men in trouble to lay blame upon every body but themselves) sup∣posing that they have without just cause, engaged themselves and all these u∣nited Colonies in an unhappy <HI>War.</HI> Yea and that the <HI>Indians</HI> were provoked to do what they did, whenas (whatever may be said of some private persons, of whose injurious dealings no complaint was made &amp; proved) it seems ve∣ry manifest to impartial Judges, that the <HI>Government</HI> in that Colony is <HI>inno∣cent</HI> as to any <HI>Wrongs</HI> that have been <HI>done</HI> to the Heathen, hy those <HI>where the Warr began.</HI> And therefore for their vindication, and for the satisfaction of those amongst our selves, (or else where) who are cordially desirous to have things cleared, respecting <HI>the Grounds of the Warr,</HI> I shall here subjoyn a Letter, which I received from <HI>Generall Winflow</HI> (whose integrity, and pe∣culiar capacity, (as being <HI>Governour of Plymouth</HI> Colony) to give information in this affair is well known) together with a <HI>Narrative of the beginning of those Troubles</HI> as it was presented to the <HI>Commissioners</HI> of the <HI>united Colonyes,</HI> in September last, for the satisfaction of considerate Brethren.</P>

<P>The many Testimonyes you have given, not only of your good respects to my unworthy self personally, but also to thus whose Colony, manifested in your endeavours to vindicate us from undeserved as∣persions, that some ignorant or worse then uncharitable persons would lay upon us, respecting the Grounds of these troubles, calls for a greater Re∣tribution then a bare acknowledgment. But Sir, my present design is on∣ly to give you further trouble, by enabling you to say something more particularly on our behalfe; to that end I have sent you the enclosed Paper which is an exact <HI>Narrative</HI> given in by Mr. <HI>Hinkly</HI> and my self, to the first Sessions of the <HI>Commissioners</HI> of the <HI>Consederate Colonyes,</HI> September last; from which the <HI>Commissioners,</HI> and the <HI>Council</HI> of your Colony, and after∣wards your <HI>General Court,</HI> took full satisfaction, as you see by their subse∣quent acts and actions. Yet much more we can truly say in our Vindica∣tion, (<ABBR>viz</ABBR>) that we have endeavoured to carry in justly and faithfully towards them at all times, and friendly beyond their deserts. I think I can clearly say, that beforethese present troubles broke out, <HI>the English did not possess

<HEAD>A brief Narrative of the beginning and progress of the present Trou∣bles between us and the Indians, taking rise in the Colony of <HI>New Plimouth June</HI> 1675. Given by the Commissioners of that Colony, for the satisfa∣ction of their Consederate Brethren, and others.</HEAD>
<P>Not to look back further then the Troubles that were between the Col∣ony of <HI>New Plimouth,</HI> and <HI>Philip,</HI> sachem of <HI>Mount-Hope,</HI> in the Year 1671. It may be remembred, that the settlement, and issue of that controversie was obtained and made (principally) by the mediation and interposed advice, and counsel of the other two consederate colonies, who upon a careful enquiry and search into the grounds of that trouble, found that the said <HI>Sachems</HI> Precences of wrongs and injuries from that Colony were groundless and false, and that he (although first in Arms) was the peccant offending party, and that <HI>Plimouth</HI> had just cause to take up Arms against him: and it was then agreed that he should pay that Colony a certain summe of Mony, in part of their Damage and Charge by him occasi∣oned, and he then not only renewed his ancient Covenant, of Friendship with them, but made himself and his People absolute subjects to our Sove∣raign Lord King <HI>Charles</HI> the II. and to that his Colony of <HI>New Plimouth,</HI> since which time, we know not that the English of that, or any other of the Colonies have been injurious to him or his, that might justly provoke them to take up Arms against us: But sometime last winter, the Governor of Plimouth was informed, by <HI>Sansaman</HI> a faithful Indian, that the said <HI>Philip</HI> was undoubtedly endeavouring to raise new troubles, and to engage all the Sachems round about in War against us. Some of the English also that lived near the said Sachem, communicated their fears and jealousies concurrent with what the Indian had informed: About a week after <HI>John Sansaman</HI> had given his Information, he was barbarously Murdered by some Indians, for his faithfulness (as we have cause to believe) to the In∣terst of God, and of the English. Sometime after <HI>Sansamans</HI> death, <HI>Philip</HI> having heard that the Governour of Plimouth had received some informa∣tion against him, and purposed to send to him to appear at the next Court, that they might enquire into those Reports, came down of his own accord to <HI>Plimouth,</HI> a little before the Court, in the beginning of <HI>March</HI> last, at which time the Council of that Colony, upon a large debate with him, had great reason to belive that the information against him might be in sub∣stance true: But not having proof thereof, and hoping that very discovery of it so far would cause him to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, they dismist him friendly, giving him only to understand, that if they heard further concerning that matter, they might see reason to demand his Arms to be delivered up for their security,
<PB REF="000220_0061_0FA36CE8C7FBFDB8"/>
(which was according to former agreement between him and them) and he engaged on their demand they should be surrendred to them or their order. At that Court we had many Indians in Examination concerning the Murder of <HI>John Sansaman,</HI> but had not then tes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mony in the case, but not long after an Indian appearing to testifie, we apprehended three by him charged, to be the Murderers, and secured them, to a tryal at our next Court holden in <HI>June,</HI> at which time, and a little before the Court, <HI>Philip</HI> began to keep his men in arms about him, and to gather Strangers to him, and to march about in Arms towards the upper end of the Neck in which he lived; and near to the English houses, who began thereby to be some∣thing disquieted, but took as yet no further notice, but only to set a Military Watch, in the next Towns of <HI>Swanzy</HI> and <HI>Rehoboth.</HI> Some hints we had that <HI>Indians</HI> were in <HI>Arms,</HI> whilst our Court was sitting, but we hoped it might arise from a guilty fear in <HI>Philip,</HI> that we would send for him, and bring him to tryal with the other Murderers, and that if he saw the Court b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ke up, and he not sent for, the cloud might blow over. And indeed our Innocence made us very secure, and confident it would not have broke into a <HI>War.</HI> But no sooner was our Court dissolved, but we had intelligence from Lieut. <HI>John Brown</HI> of <HI>Swanzy</HI> that <HI>Philip</HI> and his men continued con∣stantly in <HI>Arms,</HI> many strange Indians from several places flocked in to him, that they sent away their Wives to <HI>Narraganset,</HI> and were giving our Peo∣ple frequent Alarums by Drums, and Guns in the night, and had guarded the passages towards <HI>Plimouth,</HI> and that their young Indians were earnest for a War. On the seventh of <HI>June,</HI> Mr. <HI>Benjamin Church</HI> being on Rhode∣Island, <HI>Weesamoe</HI> (the <HI>Squaw-Sachim</HI> of <HI>Pocasset</HI>) and some of her chief men told him, that <HI>Philip</HI> intended a War speedily with the English; some of them saying that they would help him, and that he had already given them leave to kill English mens Cattle, and rob their Houses. About the 14. and 15th of <HI>June,</HI> Mr. <HI>James Brown</HI> went twice to <HI>Philip</HI> to perswade him to be quiet, but at both times found his Men in Arms, and <HI>Philip</HI> very high and not perswadable to peace. On the 14th of <HI>June,</HI> our Council writ an amicable, friendly Letter to him, shewing our dislike of his practi∣ses, and advising him to dismiss his strange <HI>Indians,</HI> and command his own men to fall quietly to their business, that our people might also be quiet, and not to suffer himself to be abused by reports concerning us, who in∣tended no hurt towards him; but Mr. <HI>Brown</HI> could not obtain any Answer from him. On the 17th of <HI>June,</HI> Mr. <HI>Pain</HI> of <HI>Rehoboth,</HI> and several En∣glish going unarmed to <HI>Mount-hope</HI> to seek their Horses, at <HI>Philips</HI> request; the Indians came and presented their Guns at them, and carried it very in∣solently, though no way provoked by them. On the 18 or 19th of <HI>June,

 Job Winflow's</HI> House, was broke open at <HI>Swanzy,</HI> and rifled by <HI>Philips</HI> men. <HI>June</HI> 20. being Sabbath day, the People of <HI>Swanzy</HI> were Alarmed by the <HI>In∣dians,</HI> two of our Inhabitants turned out of their Houses, and their Houses rifled, and the Indians were marching up (as they judged) to assault the Town, and therefore intreated speedy help from us. We thereupon, the 21st of <HI>June,</HI> sent up some to relieve that Town, and dispatched more with speed, On wednesday 23d. of <HI>June</HI> twelve more of their Houses at <HI>Swanzy</HI> were rifled. On the 24th <HI>Layton</HI> was slain at the F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll River near <HI>Pocasset.</HI> On the 25th of <HI>June,</HI> divers of our people at <HI>Swanzy</HI> were slain, and many Houses burned: until which time, and for several dayes after, though we had a considerable force there, both of our own, and of the <HI>Massachusets</HI> (to our grief and shame) they took no revenge on the Ene∣my. Thus flow were we and unwilling to engage our selves and Neigh∣bours in a <HI>War,</HI> having many insolencies, almost intollerable, from them, at whose hands we had deserved better;</P>

The above expressed Letter and Narrative will (I hope) tend to remove Prejudices out of the spirits of dissatisfyed persons, touching the grounds of the present <HI>Warr.</HI> Some have thought that if <HI>Philip</HI> (the Ring leader of all the mischief &amp; misery which hath hapned by this <HI>War</HI> ) his solemn ingagement to the English, above four years before these troubles began, were published, it would farther clear the justice of the Warr on our part, and the more, in that he doth desire, that that Covenant might testifie against him to the world, if ever he should prove unfaithfull therein. I shall therefore here sub∣joyn what was by him together with his Council, subscribed, (in the presence of sundry appertaining to this Jurisdiction) and doth still remain with their Names set to it, in the publick Records of the Colonyes.</P>

By all these things it is evident, that we may truly, say of <HI>Philip,</HI> and the <HI>Indians,</HI> who have sought to disposses us, of the Land, which the Lord our God hath given to us, as sometimes <HI>Jephthe's,</HI> and the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> said to the King of <HI>Ammon, I have not sinned against thee, but thou dost we wrong to war against me; the Lord the Judge, be Judge this day between the Children of Israel, and the Children of Ammon.</HI> And as <HI>Iehoshaphat</HI> said, when the Hea∣then in those dayes, combined to destroy the Lords People; <HI>And now be∣hold the Children of Ammon, and Monb and Mount Stir, whom thou Wouldest not let Israel invade when they came out of the Land of Egypt, but they turned from them, and destroyed them not, behold how they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy Possession, which thou hast given us to inherit, O our God milt thou not judge them?</HI> Even so, when <HI>Philip</HI> was in the hands of the <HI>English</HI> in former years, &amp; disarmed by them, they could easily but would not destroy him and his men. The Governours of that Colony have been as careful to prevent injuries to him as unto any others; yea, they kept his Land not <HI>from</HI> him but <HI>for</HI> him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> otherwise would have sold himself out of all, and the Gospel was free∣ly offered to him, and to his Subjects, but they despi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d it: And now be∣hold how they reward us! will not our God Judge them? yea he hath and will do so.</P>
