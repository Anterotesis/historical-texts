<DATE>13<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>March</HI> 1699.</DATE></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Could very willingly have dispens'd with meeting you at this time, not only because the Season of the Year makes it uneasie to many of you, who live in remote parts of the Coun∣try, to give your attendance here, but also because the day of the Anniversary <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Assembly is so near.</P>
<P>But the present Exigence of Affairs is such, That the Council and I have thought it abso∣lutely necessary, we should meet and consult about it in General Assembly.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> in this and the Neighbouring Colonies, are said to have Combin'd with the <HI>Eastern Indians,</HI> intending to make a general Insurrection and Rebellion; and if we may Credit the Advices we have from some hands, the time for Execution of this their ill Design is near at hand: and so near, that it will be in vain to try to avert the blow by Treaty or the promise of any advantages to them; but we must rather think of Suppressing them by force of Arms. In order to which you will do well to consider of a way to make such Levies of Souldiers as shall be sufficient to defend the Country, and being Levied to Discipline and make them Expert in the Exercise and Use of their Arms.</P>
<P>It were not amiss <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> if a way were found out to oblige the Forces to March out of the Province as often as the Kings Service requires it; it is our duty to assist our Neighbours and Fellow Subjects: And it has always been reckoned a point of Policy, and Prudence, to keep danger as much at a distance as 'tis possible.</P>
<P>It were well too, if a Law were made to punish Mutiny, and Desertion, in time of actual War, without which the Souldiers you Raise, will not be tractable to the Command of their Officers, and so will not answer your end in Raising them.</P>
<P>You will do well to make provision of a sufficient quantity of Arms and Ammunition, and that with all the Expedition that may be, That the Country may be furnish'd with both for their Defence.</P>
<P>Gentlemen of the House of Representatives.</P>
<P>I desire you will Inquire into the present State of the Publick Treasure of the Province; that if we must be Engag'd in a War with the <HI>Indians,</HI> there may be no want of Money to Defray the necessary Charge of it. It belongs to you to consider what that Charge will be, and to provide Funds accordingly.</P>
<CLOSER>BY Order of the House of Representatives, I do Appoint <HI>Bartholomew Green,</HI> and <HI>John Allen,</HI> to Print His Excellency's Speech.
<SIGNED><HI>James Conve<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>,</HI> Speaker.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
