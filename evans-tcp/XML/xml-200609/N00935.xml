<HEAD>Agreeable Admonitions FOR OLD and YOUNG.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>Eph. I. 12.</BIBL>
<Q>We,—Who FIRST hoped in Christ.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is a memorable passage in <HI>Euse∣btus,</HI> One of the Ancients; <Q>The Greatest Philosophers among the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> tho they talk'd much about the <HI>Immortality</HI> of the Soul, and the <HI>Felicity</HI> of the Future State, yet by their <HI>Lives</HI> they made it appear, that they did not Believe their own Talk, they really look'd on it as a Trifling Report; But, <HI>Sayes he,</HI> among us <HI>Christians,</HI> the very Boyes &amp; Girles, being assisted by the Power of our Bles∣sed Saviour, make it apparent, not only
<PB N="4" REF="001118_0003_0FB03E4E63BD42F0"/>
by their <HI>Words,</HI> but also by their <HI>Lives,</HI> that they have a powerful Belief of their having Immortal Souls, and of their coming to Eternal Blessedness in the World to come.</Q> Thus we find, e∣ven the <HI>children</HI> in the Primitive Church∣es, commended by one of the Renowned <HI>Fathers.</HI> May <HI>the Lord so Bless thy Chil∣dren in the midst of thee,</HI> O NEW ENG∣LAND, that <HI>boy</HI> may deserve such a Commendation!</P>
<P>It is a most agreeable, and a most pro∣fitable Thing, for the Ministers of the Gospel, whose <HI>Love</HI> to the Lord Jesus Christ obliges them to <HI>Feed His Lambs,</HI> to take every Occasion, for the pressing of Early Piety. Methinks I see a fair Occasion for it, in the Text, which from <HI>The Gospel of the Ephesians,</HI> now falls into our Hands. Our Apostle mentioning the Great Things done by the <HI>Grace</HI> of God, for His Chosen People, he proceeds, more particularly, to mention the <HI>Subjects,</HI> upon whom the <HI>Triumphs of Grace</HI> are multi∣plied. These are <HI>first,</HI> the Elect of God among the <HI>Jews;</HI> and <HI>then,</HI> the Elect a∣mong the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> The Former are de∣signed in the words now before us; And, Behold a singular Priviledge of the <HI>Jewish Converts.</HI> It is proposed as a singular Pri∣viledge
<PB N="5" REF="001118_0004_0FB03E5264C03400"/>
and Advantage to be, <HI>The First,</HI> who <HI>Hoped in Christ</HI> Or to Go before others in Christianity. For this then be the <HI>Doctrine,</HI> that we shall insist upon.</P>
<P>It is a Glorious Priviledge and ad∣vantage to Go before others in Ear∣ly Christianity.</P>
<P>Singular is the Comfort of those Be∣lievers, who get the start of others, in <HI>Early Believing</HI> on the Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>Let us receive this Truth with the <HI>Love of it,</HI> in the Ensuing <HI>Propositions.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. They who are <HI>Older</HI> than others in <HI>Christianity,</HI> are in some regards to be preferr'd before other Christians. They that <HI>First have Believed</HI> on the Lord Je∣sus Christ, should in some regards <HI>be first Esteemed</HI> among the People of the Lord Jesus Christ. There is a <HI>Seniority</HI> in <HI>Chris∣tianity,</HI> as well as in other Points, which is to be accounted <HI>Sacred</HI> among all <HI>Christ∣ians.</HI> It is required, Rom. 13. 7. <HI>Render to all their Dues, Honour to whom Honour.</HI> Now there is a <HI>special Honour due</HI> to <HI>Elder Christians,</HI> on the score of their being so. The <HI>Fifth</HI> Commandment requires us, to treat All men, with Respects agreeable
<PB N="6" REF="001118_0005_0FB03E532AE39958"/>
to the <HI>Place</HI> and <HI>Worth,</HI> which God has given them. It is Enjoined, 1 Pet. 2. 17. <HI>Honour all men.</HI> And we must especially <HI>Honour Old Men;</HI> And we must <HI>Honour Old Saints</HI> yet more especially. All <HI>Su∣periority</HI> is to be Dutifully acknowledged. <HI>Superiority</HI> in <HI>Age,</HI> calls for very particu∣lar Acknowledgments. It is an Edict of Heaven, Lev. 19. 32. <HI>Thou Shalt rise up before the Hoary Head, and Honour the Face of the Old Man, and Fear thy God.</HI> Now the <HI>Age</HI> of mens Christianity, may justly call for a peculiar Consideration, in the esteem of all other Christians. <HI>An Hoary Head found in the may of Righteous∣ness;</HI> and most of all, if it had entred that way, long before its growing <HI>Hoary;</HI> tis a most Honourable sight. We may see some, that Knew <HI>God,</HI> and Serv'd <HI>Christ,</HI> and Forsook <HI>Sin,</HI> and Walk'd <HI>Religiously,</HI> long before us; Yea, perhaps they were <HI>New-born</HI> before we were <HI>Born</HI> at all. How much, with what Reverence, with what Affection, ought we to prefer those <HI>Old Christians</HI> above our selves? The A∣postle <HI>Paul,</HI> could not speak of such as were <HI>Converted</HI> before him, without some Confession, that they were to be <HI>Pre∣ferred</HI> before him; Sayes he, Rom. 16. 8. <HI>They are of Note,—they were in Christ
<PB N="7" REF="001118_0006_0FB03E557B00B4B0"/>
before me. Aged Christians</HI> must be Hon∣oured with <HI>special Civilities.</HI> It becomes <HI>Younger Christians</HI> to look on <HI>Aged Christ∣ians,</HI> as their <HI>Fathers;</HI> and speak of them, and speak to them, with a <HI>Filial</HI> Venera∣tion. When we see <HI>Elder Christians,</HI> we may suppose, <Q>These are they that have <HI>done more</HI> for <HI>God,</HI> and <HI>Christ;</HI> that have more mortified the <HI>Sin that easily besets</HI> us all; that have more <HI>Experience</HI> in the Right wayes of the Lord; that are more Able to encounter <HI>Temptations;</HI> that are better <HI>Souldiers</HI> in the <HI>Wars of the Lord:</HI> that are more acquainted with <HI>Heaven,</HI> and more prepared for <HI>Heaven;</HI> than we that came long after them into the <HI>Vineyard of the LORD.</HI></Q> No small Regards are due on such Ac∣counts.</P>
<P N="2">II. They in whom the <HI>Christianity</HI> of any <HI>Society,</HI> hath its <HI>Beginning,</HI> have a <HI>Preheminence</HI> in some sort, above the rest of the Christians in the <HI>Society.</HI> The <HI>First Believers,</HI> of any <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, are Be∣lievers upon whom God hath put a Dig∣nity above the rest. When <HI>Christianity</HI> comes into any Family, or Town, or Land, there are some who <HI>First</HI> embrace it, be∣fore others. Now the <HI>First</HI> Christians of any <HI>Society,</HI> are most eminently above o∣thers,
<PB N="8" REF="001118_0007_0FB03E578A8417C8"/>
favoured of the Lord. We read, 1 Cor. 16. 15. <HI>I beseech you, Brethren (ye know she House of Stephanas</HI> [which seems to have been the Gaoler, Act 16. 27.] <HI>that it is the First-fruits of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,) that ye submit your selves unto such.</HI> The <HI>First-fruits</HI> are in some sort, the <HI>Best-fruits.</HI> In the <HI>First-fruit,</HI> there is a special Ex∣cellency; And that which makes them especially Excellent, is the Encourage∣ment which they give of <HI>more Fruits</HI> to follow. The <HI>First Converts</HI> of any Fami∣ly, or People, or Nation, have a special Remark of the Divine Favour upon them. The <HI>First-born</HI> have a claim to an <HI>Excel∣lency</HI> above the rest. Hence that passage, in the Blessing of <HI>Reuben</HI> Gen. 49. 3. <HI>My First born, the Excellency of Dignity.</HI> To be the <HI>First-born of God</HI> in any Society, is to have yet a more Extraordinary <HI>Ex∣cellency of Dignity.</HI> God, in the <HI>Effectu∣al Calling</HI> of them that are <HI>First called</HI> unto Him, in any Society, proclames His <HI>Dis∣tinguishing</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> unto these in His Eter∣nal <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> And the Lord often makes a <HI>Distinguishing Use</HI> of the <HI>first Cal∣led,</HI> for the Awakening, the Assistence, the Direction of these that are afterwards to be made partakers of <HI>Effectual Calling?</HI> In such <HI>First</HI> our Lord Jesus Christ, (as
<PB N="9" REF="001118_0008_0FB03E5878D6BC48"/>
the Apostle speaks, 1 Tim. 1. 16.) <HI>shows forth,</HI> what may be for <HI>an example to them that should hereafter Believe on Him, to E∣ver lasting Life.</HI> In the Primitive Churches, they that were <HI>First Called,</HI> were by the Apostles often Constituted the Pastors, of the Flocks that followed them; And our Lord Jesus Christ more often makes them the <HI>Pattern</HI> of them that are to fol∣low. It may be partly for this cause, that the History of the Bible singles out these and those <HI>Elders obtaining a Good Report</HI> for our Entertainment and Instruction: It singles out these and those, when there is nothing said of many Thousands that may have been equal to them, for the Grace of God. Why so? Because usu∣ally these were the <HI>First</HI> that shone with any Eminency in that Grace; and being <HI>the First,</HI> God will have them to shine brighter in His History, than any of the rest. Yea, more than so; By those that are <HI>First</HI> Converted in any Family, or People or Nation, God, as it were, takes Hold of the Kindred, &amp; gives Assurance, for the Conversion of more in His Time. The <HI>Jews</HI> who <HI>First</HI> Received the Lord Jesus Christ, Encourage us to expect a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Harvest of <HI>Jews,</HI> when the whole <HI>Jewish</HI> People and Nation shall <HI>Turn unto
<PB N="10" REF="001118_0009_0FB03E5D8A6A13A0"/>
the Lord.</HI> It is thus argued, Rom. 11. 16. <HI>If the First-fruit be Holy, the Lump is also Holy.</HI> And perhaps, there is no People or Nation, that has had any Quantity of Christians in it, but notwithstanding any horrible Apostasy and Calamity, &amp; Con∣fusion intervening, yet God will have a <HI>Reserve</HI> of more Christians, to be Gathered unto Him, from that People and Nati∣on, in the <HI>Latter Dayes,</HI> when <HI>People shall gather together, and Kingdoms to serve the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. They that <HI>Betimes</HI> come to Christ∣ianity, by an <HI>Early Repentance,</HI> in the <HI>First Years</HI> of their Lives, have glorious Ad∣vantages, above those who <HI>Delay Repen∣tance.</HI></P>
<P>There is a being <HI>First in Believing</HI> on the Lord Jesus Christ, by a more <HI>Early</HI> Christianity, than what is common in the Christian world. It is, alas, too com∣mon, for persons to Delay the Action of giving themselves up unto the Lord Je∣sus Christ by Faith, until some considera∣ble Number of Years have rolled over them. They let their <HI>Youth</HI> much of it, roll away, before they become serious Christians. But there are some, who are more <HI>Early</HI> in their Christianity; They make more <HI>Haste</HI> in Believing on the
<PB N="11" REF="001118_0010_0FB03E60DFE89C10"/>
Lord Jesus Christ. They <HI>are First</HI> even before others, in making sure of their Salvation. They do not spend their <HI>Youth,</HI> no, nor it may be, all their <HI>Child-hood,</HI> in <HI>Vanity.</HI> They do <HI>betimes</HI> Consecrate themselves unto the service of the Lord. Now, of these, tis to be asserted, That <HI>Early Re∣pentance,</HI> gives a very glorious Advan∣tage to them that have it.</P>
<P>But, <HI>What Advantage</HI> have they that are <HI>First,</HI> or more Early in Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ, above those that make it more <HI>Late,</HI> or do more lag and flag in that important matter? Why, <HI>Much every way.</HI></P>
<P>First, <HI>Early Piety</HI> and Repentance, is more <HI>Acceptable</HI> than <HI>Delay'd Repentance.</HI> The more <HI>Early</HI> we are in our Obedience to God, the more <HI>Conformable</HI> and <HI>Agree∣able</HI> we are to the Commandment of God; For the Commandment of God enjoyns <HI>Early Obedience,</HI> yea, it enjoyns <HI>Present O∣bedience.</HI> The motto upon the Command is, To Day. We read 2 Joh. 4. <HI>I re∣joyced greatly, that I found of thy Children walking in the Truth, as we have received a Commandment from the Father.</HI> Truly, is the <HI>Commandment of the Father,</HI> even unto you that are <HI>Children,</HI> that you should <HI>Walk</HI> according to the Directions
<PB N="12" REF="001118_0011_0FB03E6296C423E8"/>
of His Holy <HI>Truth.</HI> And if it be <HI>Accep∣table</HI> unto Good men, who will thereat <HI>Rejoyce greatly,</HI> to see you doing so, how much more <HI>Acceptable</HI> will it be, to the GOD of all Goodness? The Command∣ment of God is, <HI>Let the Wicked for sake his way, and let him turn unto the Lord.</HI> The Commandment of God is, <HI>Work out your own Salvation.</HI> And, <HI>This His Command∣ment, That we Believe on the Name of His Son Jesus Christ. Young</HI> People as well as <HI>Old,</HI> are concerned in the Commandment. And it is very particularly directed unto <HI>Young</HI> People, when it is said, Eccl. 12 1. <HI>Remember now thy Creator in the Dayes of thy Youth.</HI> Now, the more <HI>Conformable</HI> we are in our Obedience, to the Com∣mandment of God, the more <HI>Acceptable</HI> is our Obedience. If it could be said, Act. 17. 30. <HI>God now commands all men e∣very where to Repent,</HI> then tis plain, <HI>He now commands Young men to Repent,</HI> yea, and <HI>Now to Repent.</HI> It is therefore high∣ly pleasing to the most High God, that <HI>Young Men</HI> should not put off Repentance. The Debt of <HI>Obedience,</HI> that we owe unto God, the sooner we pay it, the more pleasing will be the payment. God hath no where said. <HI>Let Young people To <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> turn unto me.</HI> No, but He sayes, <HI>Turn
<PB N="13" REF="001118_0012_0FB03E63DE8F22A8"/>
ye NOW every one from his evil way.</HI> It is Acceptable unto Him, then to see them do so! The God of Heaven has indeed most expresly declared His most gracious and grateful Acceptance of <HI>Early Piety.</HI> What a Charming word is That; Prov. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 17. <HI>I love them that love me, They that seek me Early shall find me.</HI> Our Lord Jesus Christ had one Disciple, whom He peculiarly own'd, as His <HI>Beloved Disci∣ple;</HI> And this was, it seems, the <HI>Youngest</HI> of all His Disciples. Oh! The Tran∣scendent <HI>Love,</HI> which the Lord Jesus Christ has for the more <HI>Early Seekers</HI> of Him! And, <HI>Behold, what manner of Love, the Father</HI> bestows on them, who be∣times acknowledge Him as their <HI>Father!</HI> All Returning Sinners are welcome to the Lord; but He makes none so wel∣come, as those that are most <HI>Early</HI> in the Return. There is no melody more de∣lightful in the Ears of Heaven, than the <HI>Prayers of Young People,</HI> Beseeching and Besieging of Heaven. The sooner we list our selves under the Banner of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Kinder will be the <HI>Notice</HI> He will take of us, the Richer the <HI>Reward</HI> He will give to us. We say, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <HI>dat qui cito dat,</HI> A Grant made with Dispatch, is a <HI>Double Grant.</HI> This we
<PB N="14" REF="001118_0013_0FB03E642A7A0600"/>
may say, <HI>Early Piety</HI> is <HI>Double Piety.</HI> They are the Young <HI>Samuels,</HI> and the Young <HI>Timothies,</HI> that are the Favourites of the Lord. How can it be so <HI>Acceptable</HI> unto God, for the Children of men, to offer their <HI>Flower</HI> unto the <HI>Devil,</HI> and their <HI>Bran</HI> unto their Maker and their Savi∣our? No; tis more, far more Accep∣table, to shake off the <HI>Yoke</HI> of the <HI>Devil,</HI> and cease to be <HI>Children</HI> of <HI>Belial,</HI> even while we are yet <HI>Children,</HI> and be as <HI>Ear∣ly</HI> as we can, in putting our selves under the <HI>Yoke</HI> of our Heavenly Lord. The <HI>Earlier</HI> we begin to be for God, the more will He do for us; Yea, the more in <HI>that very thing</HI> He does for us. There is no such Token under Heaven, of one very dear to Heaven, as <HI>Early Piety;</HI> Or, for one betimes to have much of <HI>Heaven</HI> in him.</P>
<P>Secondly; <HI>Early Piety</HI> and Repen∣tance, is more <HI>Honourable</HI> than <HI>Delay'd Repentance.</HI> Is not a Child of God, more <HI>Honourable</HI> than a Child of <HI>Satan?</HI> A Servant of the Lord Jesus Christ, more <HI>Honourable</HI> than a Vassal of the <HI>Devil?</HI> An Heir of an <HI>Heavenly Crown,</HI> more <HI>Honourable,</HI> than an Heir of <HI>Death,</HI> and a Fire-brand of <HI>Hell?</HI> We may say, Psa, 149. 9. <HI>This Honour have all the Saints.</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="001118_0014_0FB03E64E4B7CBA8"/>
Well, but the sooner we come to this <HI>Honour,</HI> the more <HI>Honourable</HI> are we. By <HI>Early Piety</HI> we do betimes come to the best <HI>Honour</HI> in the world. Is it not an <HI>Honour</HI> to be the <HI>Excellent in the Earth,</HI> and, <HI>more Excellent than ones Neighbour?</HI> Tis affirmed, Psal. 16. 3. <HI>The Saints are the Excellent in the Earth;</HI> and Prov. 12. 26. <HI>The Just is more Excellent than his Neighbour.</HI> Then <HI>Early Piety</HI> is a very <HI>Honourable</HI> Thing; for it will render us, <HI>more excellent,</HI> even than <HI>the excellent.</HI> We Excel even the <HI>Excellent</HI> themselves, when we become <HI>Saints,</HI> and become <HI>Just,</HI> sooner than the rest of the <HI>Saints</HI> and of the <HI>Just.</HI> Certainly, 'tis more <HI>Honourable</HI> to be Conversing with God, in the Noble exercises of <HI>Piety,</HI> than to be Debasing and Debauching our selves, in the <HI>Beastly</HI> wayes of Wickedness. If an <HI>Angel</HI> be more <HI>Honourable</HI> than a <HI>Beast,</HI> it must be so! Sinful Man, Thou art a <HI>Beast,</HI> until <HI>Repentance</HI> do recover thee. It is <HI>Honourable</HI> to be <HI>Reasonable. Folly</HI> is a <HI>Dishonour.</HI> Tis a <HI>Shame,</HI> to play the <HI>Fool. Religion</HI> is the most <HI>Reasonable</HI> thing that ever was. The sooner we become <HI>Religious,</HI> the sooner we come to our Witts, and come to act as <HI>Reasonable</HI> men. We are truly advised, Psal. 111. 10.
<PB N="16" REF="001118_0015_0FB03E65A55B7230"/>
<HI>The Fear of the Lord is the Beginning of Wisdom, a Good Understanding have all they who do those things</HI> that are in it. Is it not more <HI>Honourable</HI> to do the part of a <HI>Wise man,</HI> and act with the Highest <HI>Reason,</HI> that it can be, to do nothing but <HI>Play the Fool?</HI> Sinner, so long as thou deferrest thy <HI>Repentance;</HI> thou art so long a <HI>Fool;</HI> Yea, <HI>Madness is thine Heart. Young People</HI> sometimes make it an Objection against <HI>Early Piety;</HI> They shall be <HI>Despi∣sed,</HI> and perhaps <HI>Derided</HI> for it. But, <HI>Behold, Ye Despisers, and Wonder</HI> at your own unspeakable Infatuation; <HI>Reason</HI> is <HI>Despised</HI> by <HI>Folly; Wisdom</HI> is <HI>Derided</HI> by <HI>Madness,</HI> when you <HI>Mock</HI> at Early <HI>Piety.</HI> Be advised of This, and then, <HI>Mock on,</HI> if you Resolve to <HI>Perish.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly; <HI>Early Piety</HI> and Repentance, is more <HI>comfortable</HI> than <HI>Delay'd Repen∣tance.</HI> What are the <HI>wayes of Piety,</HI> but <HI>wayes of Pleasancy:</HI> We read, Prov. 3. 17. <HI>Her wayes are wayes of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.</HI> Well then, the sooner thou comest into those wayes, the more of <HI>Pleasure</HI> and of <HI>Comfort,</HI> will thy Life be sweetned withal. The more <HI>Early</HI> thou art in thy Piety, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sooner shalt thou <HI>See</HI> thy <HI>Name written
<PB N="17" REF="001118_0016_0FB03E69AFC44198"/>
in Heaven,</HI> to which no Delight on Earth is comparable; the sooner shalt thou <HI>Hear</HI> the <HI>very Great and Precious Promise</HI> of God Ravishing of thee with their continual Melody; the sooner shalt thou <HI>Taste</HI> that <HI>the Lord is Gracious</HI> in the Entertainments of a Fellow-ship with Him; and the sooner shalt thou <HI>Feel</HI> the Divine Consolations of the Holy Spirit, which are <HI>not Small,</HI> reviving of thee. By <HI>Dela<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing</HI> of Repentance, men put themselves under grievous and woful Disadvantages. Tis therefore a more Advantagious and Comfortable thing to <HI>Repent Betimes;</HI> Yea, My Child, <HI>As soon as ever thou canst.</HI></P>
<P>There are especially Two very asto∣nishing Mischiefs of a <HI>Delay'd Repentance;</HI> and it is a most comfortable Thing, to be by <HI>Early Repentance</HI> rescued from those Mischiefs.</P>
<P>First; A <HI>Delay'd Repentance</HI> will be a <HI>Difficult Repentance.</HI> We read, Jer. 13. 23. <HI>Can the Moor change his Skin, or the Leopard his Spotts? Then may ye also do Good, that are accustomed to do Evil.</HI> A Delay to <HI>Repeat</HI> of <HI>Evil-doing,</HI> produces <HI>Customs</HI> to <HI>do Evil.</HI> How hard is it, forto be brought off an <HI>Evil Custome?</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="001118_0017_0FB03E6A2C9CC2D8"/>
When our <HI>Corrupt Nature,</HI> is become a <HI>Second Nature,</HI> how uneasy is the Con∣quest over it. The most <HI>Early</HI> Piety, is the most <HI>Easy</HI> Piety. The less <HI>Inveterate</HI> the Maladies of our Souls are, the more easily performed is the Cure of them. <HI>Early</HI> Piety prevents the Inveteracy of our Maladies. Tis true, All things are <HI>alike Easy</HI> to that <HI>Omnipotent Arm</HI> which <HI>Heals all our Diseases;</HI> but the Patient must undergo the more Trouble, to be Healed, the longer he has been under his <HI>Diseases.</HI> The <HI>Old Man</HI> within us, will be subdued with the less of Trouble and Anguish unto us, if we set upon subduing of it, before we grow <HI>Old</HI> our selves. The <HI>Devil</HI> will be <HI>Dispossessed,</HI> with the less of Tearing Agony, where he has less <HI>Prescription to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> for his <HI>Possession.</HI> The <HI>Weeds of Hell</HI> in our Hearts, the sooner they are Plucked up, the less <HI>Rooted</HI> they are, and so the more easily plucked up. Soul, Thou art but <HI>Harden∣ing,</HI> and <HI>Confirming</HI> thy self in Sin while thou dost not <HI>Repent</HI> of thy Sin. Hap∣py the Soul that gets rid of an <HI>hard Heart,</HI> wile tis most Easy to get rid of it.

<P>Secondly; A <HI>Delay'd Repentance</HI> will be a <HI>Dubious Repentance.</HI> It is an awful Hint; Prov. 27. 1. <HI>Boast not thy self of To morrow, for thou knowest not what a Day may bring forth.</HI> Early <HI>Piety</HI> puts it of Doubt, that our Souls are safe, and we may thereupon <HI>Rejoyce in the Hope of the Glory of God.</HI> But while we put off the care of our Immortal Souls, we run the dread fullest, and the desperatest Hazards, that can be run <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by Mortal men; even the Hazards of losing our Souls forever.

<P N="1">I. May <HI>Aged Christians</HI> Challenge a special Honour from <HI>other Christians?</HI> Let all <HI>Aged Christians</HI> be careful to <HI>de∣serve</HI> the Honour that they <HI>Challenge.</HI> May you that are the <HI>First Christian</HI> be <HI>First-rate Christians. Fathers,</HI> You must go before <HI>Others</HI> in Exemplary Christia∣nity, if you would be set <HI>Above other</HI> Christians. An <HI>Old Christian</HI> is a very <HI>Venerable</HI> Thing. The <HI>Heraldry</HI> of Christianity, would look upon that, as a special mark of Honour in a Scutcheon; Act. 21. 16. <HI>An Old Disciple.</HI> But by gross failings, he may too much make himself a <HI>Contemptible</HI> Thing. You that have been longer in the school of the Lord JESUS CHRIST than o∣thers have been, Oh! YOU should be more Holy, more Devout, more Watch∣ful, more Fruitful, and more Heavenly, than others are. 'Twill be your <HI>Dis∣grace,</HI> and what can be said for your <HI>Ex∣cuse?</HI> If you that came the <HI>First</HI> into the School of Christianity, should yet continue in the <HI>Lowest Form</HI> of the School.

disagreeable? Even when you come to be <HI>Twice Children</HI> as we say, yet it is pity that you should be of a <HI>Childish</HI> Be∣haviour.</P>
<P>I am to <HI>Entreat Old Men at Fathers.</HI> Wherefore, <HI>My Fathers,</HI> and all you that were in <HI>the Lord Jesus Christ before me;</HI> I <HI>Entreat</HI> you, To <HI>Examine</HI> your selves, what <HI>Progress</HI> you have made in Chri∣stianity: <HI>Examine,</HI> whether you have now any more clear <HI>Knowledge of Him that is from the Beginning,</HI> than you had at the <HI>Beginning: Examine,</HI> whether you are any Readier for <HI>Death,</HI> than you were when your Death was further off? I <HI>Entreat</HI> you, to procure unto your selves; that Praise, <HI>Thy Last works are more than the First;</HI> and grow more full of <HI>Christ,</HI> and <HI>Heaven,</HI> than you were <HI>at the First.</HI> You have one Foot in the <HI>Grave,:</HI> I beseech you, Sirs, where should the other be? And I <HI>Entreat</HI> you, to take the Apostolical Admoniti∣on, Tit. 2. 2. <HI>That the Aged Men be Sober, Grave, Temperate, Sound in Faith, in Charity, in Patience.</HI> I <HI>Entreat</HI> you, Do not Exemplify an Observation of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> That while the Spirit of God, working in <HI>Young</HI> Ones, many times does give out early Discoveries of His Grace,

It is probable, that when that Heavenly <HI>Leaven</HI> is once gotten in, it will spread further, and sieze upon more; but you will be the <HI>Morning∣Stars</HI> among those <HI>Children of Light.</HI> We read of <HI>Abraham;</HI> Rom. 4. 16. <HI>He is the Father of us all.</HI> Why because he was in some respects one of the <HI>First,</HI> that led the way in leaving all at the Call of God, in the <HI>Faith</HI> of His. <HI>Messiah.</HI> Thus, all that God will Effectually Call unto Himself out of thy <HI>Family,</HI> will <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thee, their <HI>Father,</HI> if thou art the

<P>Surely, It cannot be <HI>too Soon</HI> for an<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of you, as <HI>Young</HI> as you are, to become <HI>Serious Christians,</HI> and with a Renewal of your <HI>Baptismal Covenant,</HI> give your selves up unto the Lord, saying, <HI>O my God, Thou shalt be my Father, my Sa∣viour, my Leader!</HI> What?

<P>Or, Can it be <HI>Too soon</HI> for thee to <HI>Prize</HI> the Lord Jesus Christ?

<P>If none of all these Thoughts are <HI>Live∣ly</HI> Enough, or if none of them will En∣liven thy <HI>Early Religion,</HI> Think, Think on thy own <HI>Mortality.</HI> It is not <HI>too Soon</HI> for you to <HI>Dy:</HI> Oh, why should it be <HI>too Soon</HI> for you to <HI>begin a New Life,</HI> and Preparation for <HI>Death.</HI> If you <HI>Dy</HI> before this be done, it had been Good <HI>for you, that you had never been Born.</HI> If this be seasonably done, the sooner you <HI>Dy,</HI> the sooner you enter into <HI>Joy.</HI> How many <HI>Young People</HI> have already <HI>Dy'd</HI> before you?

<P><HI>Consider</HI> this, O all you Young People that <HI>Forget God,</HI> last ye be <HI>torn to pieces</HI> by the Deadly strokes of His Indigna∣tion, and there be <HI>none to deliver you!</HI></P>

<P><HI>That me should be to the Praise of His Glory who first Hoped in Christ.</HI></P>
<P>Accordingly;</P>
<P>First; An Early <HI>Hope in the Lord Jesus Christ;</HI> Oh, My <HI>Young People,</HI> Endeavour

Oh! That you would by <HI>Faith</HI> repair to the Lord Jesus Christ, with <HI>Satisfaction,</HI> that He is both Able and Willing to bring you, to all the Blessedness contained in the Promises of God; and then by <HI>Hope,</HI> Entertain an Heart-satisfying <HI>Expectation</HI> of that Blessedness. Rejoyce, O my <HI>Young People,</HI> Rejoyce in the <HI>Hope of the Glory of God;</HI> but place all your <HI>Hope</HI> on the Lord Jesus Christ; among whose Charming Titles this is one; [1.

manner of Good. We read, Col 1. 27. of, <HI>Christian us the Hope of Glory.</HI> There is no mercy of God, but the Lord Jesus Christ must be in you, the <HI>Hope</HI> of that mercy; and without the Lord Jesus Christ, you can have no <HI>Hope,</HI> that <HI>He who made you will have mercy on you.</HI></P>
<P>May you be revived first, with an <HI>Hope,</HI> that you <HI>May</HI> come unto the Lord Jesus Christ. By no means <HI>Despair</HI> of it! This I am sure of; The Gracious Lord Jesus Christ Inviteth you; to <HI>Come</HI> to Him, and <HI>Hope</HI> in Him. The Invitation is Indefinite, unto; <HI>whosoever will.</HI> And we have it in our Commission to assure the <HI>Young People,</HI> who are willing to come under the <HI>Yoke</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ in <HI>their Youth,</HI> They may <HI>Hope for the Sal∣vation of God.</HI> O Sinner, Dost thou Question, whether the Lord Jesus Christ will receive thee, if thou come unto Him?

It is a most <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> word of the Lord Je∣sus Christ, and the worst Sinner among us all may lay hold on that word; Joh. 6. 17. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that comith unto me, I will in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</HI> Let the Light of so much <HI>Hope</HI> as this, break in thro' some Crevis, into thy Returning Soul; <HI>If I do

Return, &amp; I may hope that it may be, Sovereign Grace will help me to Return, unto God in my Lord Jesus Christ, He that came to seek and save, that which is lost, will take pity on me.</HI></P>
<P>But then, if you <HI>do</HI> come unto the Lord Jesus Christ, let your <HI>Hope</HI> then proceed unto a Confidence, That He will do for you most wonderful Things, and <HI>Save you unto the uttermost.</HI> Oh! <HI>Hope</HI> in the Lord Redeemer, for <HI>with Him, there is Mercy and Plenteous Redemption!</HI> Shall I a little state your <HI>Hope</HI> for you?</P>
<P>Let the <HI>God-head</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, be the main <HI>Basis</HI> of your <HI>Hope.</HI> And now, Let Heaven hear our <HI>Young People,</HI> Saying, and hoping.</P>
<P><Q>Since my Lord Jesus Christ is <HI>God,</HI> the <HI>Merit</HI> of His Obedience is Infinite. I may <HI>Hope,</HI> that the Obedience of my Lord Jesus Christ, will be a sufficient <HI>Righteousness</HI> for me therein to appear before God, because it is the <HI>Righteous∣ness of God:</HI> And since His Blood, is the <HI>Blood of the Son of God, I Hope</HI> to be <HI>Cleansed from all Sin</HI> by that Blood. Since my Lord Jesus Christ is <HI>God,</HI> His <HI>Power</HI> is Infinite, Uncontroulable, Ir∣resistable. Oh! <HI>I know He can do every

<P>But then, Let not the <HI>Man-hood</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, assumed into a Per∣sonal Union with His <HI>God-head,</HI> be Ex∣cluded from a share in the <HI>Basis</HI> of your hope. Tis the <HI>Anchor</HI> of your Souls. May your <HI>Hope</HI> thus argue upon it.</P>
<P><Q>I hope that He who humbles Him∣self to <HI>behold the things in Heaven,</HI> will have regard unto me, a poor <HI>Worm</HI> up∣on Earth; because the <HI>Son of God</HI> is be∣come the <HI>Son of Man.</HI> I hope that I shall one day be Lodged in <HI>Heaven with God;</HI> because there is a Man who lies in the <HI>Bosome of God</HI> forever. I hope I shall come to <HI>Endless Glory</HI> in the End; because there is a <HI>Man,</HI> who sets on the <HI>Throne of Glory,</HI> and will have His Kindred, for to be at last, <HI>with Him, where He is, to Behold His Glory.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="001118_0034_0FB03E9FD22F9038"/>
Pass on then, O <HI>Young People,</HI> to fix your hope, on the <HI>Offices,</HI> which the Lord Jesus Christ Executes on the behalf of His Chosen People. 'T will be Melody in the Ears of Heaven, to hear you say∣ing, and singing, and hoping;</P>
<P><Q>I hope, that my Sins are forever Ex∣piated; because I have such a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, as my Lord Jesus Christ.

<P>And, finally, Let the <HI>Conditions</HI> thro' which the Lord Jesus Christ has passed for us, furnish my <HI>Young People,</HI> with ravishing matter for their hope.</P>

<P>O <HI>Young People;</HI> God will take plea∣sure in you, if you thus <HI>Fear Him, and Hope in His Mercy.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly; An Early <HI>Dedication</HI> to the <HI>Praise of the Infinite Glory of God;</HI> Oh, My <HI>Young People,</HI> Resolve upon it. I have read, Rev. 14. 6. of, <HI>An Angel having
<PB N="37" REF="001118_0036_0FB03EA3D6A22C98"/>
the Everlasting Gospel to Preach, and saying with a loud Voice, Fear God, and give Glory to Him.</HI> Tis that <HI>Angelical</HI> Demand, with which I now come unto you, O Darling part of my Flock; Let the Glorious God, and the Glory of God, from this Time, have Eternal Praises from you.</P>
<P>Let there be a little set before you, some <HI>Idoea,</HI> of the Noblest, and the Sweetest Point, that ever you were treated upon; A <HI>Point,</HI> which were in∣deed a <HI>Boundless Ocean,</HI> if it were, as it might be prosecuted!</P>
<P>The Great GOD, is a most <HI>Glorious</HI> God. He is, The <HI>God of Glory;</HI> the <HI>King of Glory.</HI> God the <HI>Father,</HI> is the <HI>Father of Glory.</HI> God the <HI>Son,</HI> is the <HI>Lord of Glory.</HI> God the <HI>Spirit,</HI> is the <HI>Spirit of Glory.</HI> His Excellencies are in∣finite. It is His <HI>Glory,</HI> to be JEHOVAH, of Himself, and for Himself alone; Eter∣nally and Necessarily Self-existent, In∣dependent, All-sufficient, Unchangeable; the First Cause and the Last End of all things. He is Glorious in Holiness, in Faithfulness, in Power, in Wisdome, in Goodness. There can be no Addition
<PB N="38" REF="001118_0037_0FB03EA3F8E118A0"/>
to His <HI>Glory;</HI> Who can Add unto that which is <HI>Infinite?</HI> God was in Himself as <HI>Glorious,</HI> before He made the world, as after His making of it. And if the world were filled with Blasphemies a∣gainst God, He would not yet be less <HI>Glorious</HI> than He is.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Glorious</HI> God is infinitely sa∣tisfied, in the Manifestations, the Ope∣rations, and the Exhibitions of His <HI>Glory.</HI> The First Being is admirably, <HI>Energetick.</HI> God from all Eternity, Beholding of Himself, there was <HI>Begotten</HI> an <HI>Image</HI> of Himself. This is the <HI>Son of God,</HI> the <HI>Brightness of His Glory, the Express Image of His Person.</HI> Infinite is the Satisfacti∣on of God, from all Eternity, in behold∣ing of His <HI>Glory,</HI> as it is Expressed in His <HI>Only Begotten Son;</HI> whose Triumph it is, <HI>I was set up from Everlasting, I was brought forth before the Mountains were settled; Then was I daily His De∣light!</HI> And why did God, so satisfied from all ETERNITY, proceed unto the <HI>Works</HI> of Creation, and Providence, even unto all the <HI>Works of Time?</HI> This is, that He may take the satisfaction of Beholding His own <HI>Glory,</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="001118_0038_0FB03EA4AB105290"/>
as it is Expressed in all His <HI>Works.</HI> If the Works of God had no other Specta∣tor, but the God who has wrought them all; This, This were enough; This were infinitely more, than for all the <HI>Works</HI> to take Notice of themselves, or of one another.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, 'Tis a particular Sa∣tisfaction, unto the <HI>Glorious God,</HI> that <HI>Rational Beings</HI> do particularly observe the <HI>Manifestations</HI> of His <HI>Glory.</HI> There are <HI>Intellectual Beings,</HI> formed by the <HI>Great God, that formeth All Things.</HI> There is a World of <HI>Spirits;</HI> Angels and Men, Things that have <HI>Reasonable Spirits</HI> in them, are made by that God, who is the <HI>Father of Spirits.</HI> That <HI>Spiritual World</HI> is a Million of Times more Con∣siderable, than the <HI>Corporeal World.</HI> These <HI>Intellectual Beings</HI> are capable of Observing and Regarding and Admi∣ring the <HI>Glory</HI> of God. God sayes, <HI>I formed them for my self, to shew forth my Praise.</HI> Thus <HI>Good</HI> is our God!</P>
<P>Now God will have us to <HI>Glorify</HI> Him, in Declaring the <HI>Praises of His Glory,</HI> falling under our Observation. And in these two wayes, are we to Declare the
<PB N="40" REF="001118_0039_0FB03EA5C4EB7DB0"/>
<HI>Praise</HI> of the <HI>Glorious God.</HI> First, We must our selves <HI>Acknowledge the Glory</HI> of God; and be sensible of those <HI>Glorious</HI> Things in God, that shall draw us, to Fear Him, and Love Him, and Seek Him, and Serve Him; and make His Will the only Rule of our Life, and count His Good Will to be better than Life. And then, We must Invite and Engage <HI>Others,</HI> to joyn with us, in those <HI>Acknowledgments</HI> of God; So that from what we are, or have, or do, <HI>Honourable Thoughts of God</HI> shall be Raised in the minds of <HI>Others,</HI> and <HI>O∣thers</HI> shall devote themselves unto the Lord.</P>
<P>This tis, <HI>To Glorify God.</HI> This is all the <HI>Revenue,</HI> that God Expects, of all that He does for us. Yea, Tis that for which He brings us to all the <HI>Glory</HI> of Heaven at the Last! And all those whom He brings to Heaven, He does first inspire with a Disposition, to make Choice of this above all things, <HI>That they may be thus unto the Praise of His Glory.</HI></P>
<P>Well then, My <HI>Young People;</HI> When will you become thus Disposed. Oh!

<P><Q><HI>O Glorious God,</HI> I am not able to bear the Thoughts of Living, or of Being, upon any lower Design than This; <HI>That the Glorious God may have the Praises of His Glory from me.</HI> What is my Errand into the world, but that I may Glorify the God, who made me, and all the world! I was not Born only to Eat, and Drink, and Play, &amp; Sleep, and by some Labour, to pur∣chase Conveniencies for all of these No; Nothing will please me, O my God, but This; <HI>That thy Glory may have Praises from me;</HI> and that I may Glo∣rify God, and my Lord Jesus Christ, in Conforming to the <HI>Rules</HI> and <HI>Hopes</HI> of His Holy Religion Lord, I would not only <HI>Speak</HI> any <HI>Praises,</HI> but I would also <HI>Live</HI> thy <HI>Praises.</HI> To bear <HI>Testi∣monies</HI> unto thy <HI>Glory,</HI> shall be the very Business of my <HI>Life.</HI> I will make it my main Business, to Testify any Believe, <HI>I have

That God is a Good Portion;</HI> and, <HI>That nothing is too hard for the Lord;</HI> And, <HI>That the Lord is of purer Eyes than to look upon Iniquity;</HI> And, <HI>That the Lord is Good unto the Soul that seeks Him;</HI> And, That my Lord <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> is Preci∣ous, and Lovely, and Worthy of all my Services. I will abhor all <HI>Sin,</HI> because 'tis not for the <HI>Praise of the Glorious God. I Consecrate,</HI> all my <HI>Powers,</HI> all my <HI>Mem∣bers,</HI> all my <HI>Interest:</HI> unto thee, O my God! Oh! That thou mayest have <HI>Glo∣ry</HI> from them all.
