<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following pages are given to the world by a son, whose filial affection may perhaps have in∣duced him to entertain too high an opinion of the merit of his father's productions; but who candid∣ly owns, his motives to the publication were, a con∣viction that the work is calculated to afford consi∣derable amusement and instruction, and a warm de∣sire to rescue the memory of a father from oblivion.</P>
<P>Though to all they may not appear in the light in which they do to me, as precious memorials of that wit and poetical genius which once animated the breast of him who is now forever laid in the silent tomb, and who once was the delight of his friends and family; yet many, I hope, when they read this work, will remember a departed friend, and mourn the loss of the man while they enjoy the humour of the poet. All I trust will here find abundant subjects of merri∣ment and diversion.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="034158_0004_0FFC8473D57B5808"/>The author appears to have thoroughly understood the true points of ridicule in human characters, and to have drawn them with great accuracy and variety in his comedies. The piece entitled, The Candidates, is intended to laugh to scorn the practice of corrup∣tion, and falsehood; of which too many are guilty in electioneering; to teach our countrymen to despise the arts of those who meanly attempt to influence their votes by any thing but merit.—The play of the Patriots is a picture of real and pretended patriots; by which the reader may perceive the difference between them, may learn to honour and reward the true, and to treat the false with infamy and con∣tempt. If any construction should be put upon it as a satire on the conduct of America in the late re∣volution, the whole tenour of the author's political conduct will exempt him from the imputation of such an intention. He entered warmly into the prin∣ciples of the friends of America, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oldly fought in her defence, and proved his attachment to her cause not by words only, but by deeds. The play itself also speaks a different language; and evidently proves it was written in ridicule of political hypo∣crites, and not of the true friends of their country.</P>
<P>With respect to the other poems, I believe the translation of Ovid will be found to be very correct
<PB N="vii" REF="034158_0005_0FFC8472521F9278"/>
and highly poetical. The author intended, if he had lived, to translate the whole work, but death put an end to his design. The smaller poems I submit to the reader, without saying any thing of their merit, as I wish not to forestall a pleasure, or to raise too great expectations.</P>
<P>With these short observations, gentle reader, I bid thee adieu; with a sincere wish that the work before thee may afford thee rational amusement.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY A FRIEND.</BYLINE>
<L>LADIES and gentlemen, to-night you'll see</L>
<L>A bard delighting in satiric glee;</L>
<L>In merry scenes his biting tale unfold,</L>
<L>And high to Folly's eye the mirror hold:</L>
<L>Here eager candidates shall call for votes,</L>
<L>And bawling voters louder stretch their throats:</L>
<L>Here may you view, in groups diverting, join'd</L>
<L>The poor and wealthy rabble of mankind;</L>
<L>All who deserve the lash, the lash will find.</L>
<L>Here characters, whose names are now unknown,</L>
<L>Shall shine again, as in their spheres they shone;</L>
<L>While some may make malicious explanation,</L>
<L>And know them all still living in the nation.</L>
<L>If any present, say, fie, shameless bard!</L>
<L>Hast thou for decency no more regard</L>
<L>Than at thy betters, thus to make a stand,</L>
<L>And boldly point out meanness, contraband,</L>
<L>Depreciating the wisdom of the land?</L>
<L>Tho' such, the wond'rous sympathy of wits,</L>
<L>That every fool will wear the cap that fits,</L>
<L>I boldly answer, how could he mean you,</L>
<L>Who, when he wrote, about you nothing knew?</L>
<L>The state of things was such, in former times,</L>
<L>'Ere wicked kings were punish'd for their crimes▪</L>
<L>Then strove the candidates to gain their seats</L>
<L>Most heartily, with drinking bouts, and treats;</L>
<L>The meanest vices all the people stain'd,</L>
<L>And drunkenness, and monarchy both reign'd,</L>
<L>With such strong cause his anger to engage,</L>
<L>How could our Bard restrain satiric rage?</L>
<L><PB N="xii" REF="034158_0009_0FFC8467B33D9D60"/>But, God forbid, its edge shou'd now apply,</L>
<L>Or on our race-field, when you cast an eye</L>
<L>You there a home-election—should espy.</L>
<L>Science and virtue, now are wider spread,</L>
<L>And crown with dignity, fair Freedom's head.</L>
<L>We only pray this satire ne'er be just,</L>
<L>Save when apply'd to other times, and trust</L>
<L>Its keenness only, a rememb'rancer,</L>
<L>And guard from future evils, may appear.</L>
<L>If, after this, objections should remain,</L>
<L>The mot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve's envy, consciousness disdain,</L>
<L>Or any thing, except the poet's want</L>
<L>Of sense, which no true publisher will grant.</L>
<L>Yet virtue i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not in our story lost,</L>
<L>E'en then, Virginians could much virtue boast.</L>
<L>With plaudits, therefore, and free laughter own</L>
<L>Virginia's first and only comic son;</L>
<L>Ah! could the bard, rejoicing, raise his head</L>
<L>To hear his praise!—Alas! the bard is dead.</L>

<HEAD>SCENE I. Mr. Wou'dbe's house.</HEAD>
<STAGE>Enter Wou'dbe with a news-paper in his hand.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wou'dbe.</SPEAKER>
<P>I AM very sorry our good old governor Botetourt has left us. He well de∣served our friendship, when alive, and that we should for years to come, with gratitude, remember his mild and affable deportment. Well, our little world will soon be up, and very busy towards our next election. Must I again be subject to the humours of a fickle croud? Must I again resign my reason, and be nought but what each voter pleases? Must I cajole, fawn, and wheedle, for a place that brings so little profit?</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter Ralpho.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralpho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir John Toddy is below, and if your ho∣nour is at leisure, would beg to speak to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wou'dbe.</SPEAKER>
<P>My compliments to Sir John, and tell him, I shall be glad of his company. So—Sir John, some time ago, heard me say I was willing to resign my seat in the house to an abler person, and he comes modestly to accept of it.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter Sir John Toddy.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Wou'dbe, your most obedient ser∣vant, sir; I am proud to find you well. I hope you are in good health, sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="14" REF="034158_0011_0FFC84632ADB2548"/>
<SPEAKER>Wou'dbe.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, I am obliged to you, Sir John. Why, Sir John, you surely are practising the gri∣mace and compliments you intend to make use of among the freeholders in the next election, and have introduced yourself to me with the self-same com∣mon-place expressions that we candidates adopt when we intend to wheedle a fellow out of his vote—I hope you have no scheme upon me, Sir John?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, sir, upon my honour, sir, it was punctually to know how your lady and family did, sir, 'pon honour, sir, it was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wou'dbe.</SPEAKER>
<P>You had better be more sparing of your honour at present, Sir John; for, if you are a candi∣date, whenever you make promises to the people that you can't comply with, you must say upon ho∣nour, otherwise they won't believe you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon honour, sir, I have no thought to set up for a candidate, unless you say the word.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wou'dbe.</SPEAKER>
<P>Such condescension from you, Sir John, I have no reason to expect: you have my hearty consent to do as you please, and if the people choose you their Representative, I must accept of you as a colleague.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>As a colleague, Mr. Wou'dbe! I was thinking you did not intend to stand a poll, and my business, sir, was to get the favour of you to speak a good word for me among the people.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wou'dbe.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope you have no occasion for a trum∣peter, Sir John? If you have, I'll speak a good word to you, and advise you to decline.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Mr. Wou'dbe, after you declin'd, I thought I was the next <HI>fittenest</HI> man in the county,
<PB N="15" REF="034158_0012_0FFC8461869A1FE0"/>
and Mr. Wou'dbe, if you would be ungenerous, tho' you are a laughing man, you would tell me so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wou'dbe.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would be ungenerous indeed, Sir John, to tell you what the people could never be induced to believe. But I'll be ingenuous enough to tell you, Sir John, if you expect any assistance from me, you'll be disappointed, for I can't think you the <HI>fit∣tenest</HI> man I know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, sir, who do you know besides? Perhaps I may be thought as fit as your honour. But, sir, if you are for that, the hardest fend off: damn me, if I care a farthing for you; and so, your servant, sir.
<STAGE>Exit Sir John.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wou'dbe.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, I have got the old knight, and his friend Guzzle, I suppose, against me, by speaking so freely; but their interest, I believe, has not weight enough among the people, for me to lose any thing, by making them my enemies. Indeed, the being in∣timate with such a fool as Sir John, might tend more to my discredit with them, for the people of Virginia have too much sense not to perceive how weak the head must be that is always filled with liquor. Ral∣pho!—</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter Ralpho.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralpho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, what does your honour desire?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wou'dbe.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm going into my library, and if any gentleman calls, you may introduce him to me there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ral.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, sir. But, master, as election-times are coming, I wish you would remember a poor servant, a little.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wou'dbe.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you want?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ral.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, the last suit of clothes your honour gave me is quite worn out. Look here,

his elbows)</HI></STAGE>
the insigns, (as I have heard your ho∣nour say, in one of your fine speeches) the insigns of faithful service. Now, methinks, as they that set up for bur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sses, cut a dash, and have rare sport, why migh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not their servants have a little decreation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wou'dbe.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand you, Ralpho, you wish to amuse yourself, and make a figure among the girls this Election, and since such a desire is natural to the young, and innocent if not carried to excess, I am willing to satisfy you; you may therefore, have the suit I pulled off yesterday, and accept this present as an evidence that I am pleased with your diligence and fidelity, and am ever ready to reward it.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Exit Wou'dbe.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralpho.</SPEAKER>
<P>God bless your honour! what a good mas∣ter! who would not do every thing to give such a one pleasure? But, e'gad, it's time to think of my new clothes: I'll go and try them on. Gadso! this fi∣gure of mine is not reconsiderable in its delurements, and when I'm dressed out like a gentleman, the girls, I'm a thinking, will find me desistible.

<P>Aye, aye, very strange: but your friends Strutabout and Smallhopes, I like so little as never

to take a glass from them, because I shall never pay the price which is always expected for it, by voting against my conscience: I therefore don't go, to avoid being asked for what I won't give.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ned.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very disteress motive, truly, but for the matter of that, you've not so much to boast of your friend Wou'dbe, if what I have been told of him is true; for I have heard say, he and the fine beast of a gentleman, Sir John Toddy, have joined interess. Mr. Wou'dbe, I was creditly 'formed, was known for to say, he wouldn't serve for a burgess, unless Sir John was elected with him.</P>

<P>What's that you say, neighbour? has Mr. Wou'dbe and Sir John joined interest?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ned.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, they have; and ant there a clever fel∣low for ye? a rare burgess you will have, when a fel∣low gets in, who will go drunk, and be a sleeping in the house! I wish people wouldn't pretend for to hold up their heads so high, who have such friends and associates. There's poor Mr. Smallhopes, who isn't as much attended to, is a very proper gentleman, and is no drunkard, and has no drunken companions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1<HI>st Freeholder.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I don't believe it. Mr. Wou'dbe's a cleverer man than that, and people ought to be ashamed to went such slanders.</P>

Mr. Strut∣about would do very well if he was not such a cox∣comb. As for Smallhopes, I'd as soon send to New-Market, for a burgess, as send him, and old Sir John loves tipple too well: egad, I'll give Wou'dbe my vote, and throw away the other.

<SPEAKER>Ralpho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Strutabout waits upon your honour.</P>

<P>Desire him to walk in.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter Mr. Strutabout.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Strutabout.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Wou'dbe, your servant. Consi∣dering the business now in hand, I think you con∣fine yourself too much at home. There are several little reports circulating to your disadvantage, and as a friend, I would advise you to shew yourself to the people, and endeavour to confute them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wou'dbe.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe, sir, I am indebted to my bro∣ther candidates, for most of the reports that are pro∣pagated to my disadvantage, but I hope, Mr. Strut∣about is a man of too much honour, to say any thing in my absence, that he cannot make appear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Strutabout.</SPEAKER>
<P>That you may depend on, sir. But there are some who are so intent upon taking your place, that they will stick at nothing to obtain their ends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wou'dbe.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you in the secret, sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Strutabout.</SPEAKER>
<P>So far, sir, that I have had overtures from Mr. Smallhopes and his friends, to join my in∣terest with their's, against you. This, I rejected with disdain, being conscious that you were the properest person to serve the county; but when Smallhopes told me, he intended to prejudice your interest by scat∣tering a few stories among the people, to your disad∣vantage,
<PB N="21" REF="034158_0018_0FFC8452F0940518"/>
it raised my blood to such a pitch, that had he not promised me to be silent, I believe I should have chastised him for you myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wou'dbe.</SPEAKER>
<P>If, sir, you were so far my friend, I am obliged to you: though whatever report he is the author of, will, I am certain, gain little credit with the people.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Strutabout.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe so; and therefore, if you are willing, we'll join our interests together, and soon convince the fellow, that by attacking you he has in∣jured himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wou'dbe.</SPEAKER>
<P>So far from joining with you, or any body else, or endeavouring to procure a vote for you, I am determined never to ask a vote for myself, or re∣ceive one that is unduly obtained.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter Ralpho.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ral.</SPEAKER>
<P>Master, rare news, here's our neighbour Guzzle, as drunk as ever Chief Justice Cornelius was upon the bench.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wou'dbe.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's no news, Ralpho: but do you call it rare news, that a creature in the shape of man, and endued with the faculties of reason, should so far debase the workmanship of heaven, by making his carcase a receptacle for such pollution?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralpho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Master, you are hard upon neighbour Guzzle: our Justices gets drunk, and why not poor Guzzle? But, sir, he wants to see you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wou'dbe.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tell him to come in.
<STAGE>(exit Ralpho).</STAGE>
All must be made welcome now.</P>

<PB N="22" REF="034158_0019_0FFC84515E0B19E0"/>
<SPEAKER>Wou'dbe.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm something more in my senses than you, John, tho' not so sensible as you would have me, I suppose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Guzzle.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I can make you sensible how much I want my bottle filled, and how much I shall love the contents, it's all the senses I desire you to have.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralpho.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I may be allowed to speak, neighbour Guzzle, you are wrong; his honour sits up for a burgess, and should have five senses at least.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Guzzle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Five senses! how, what five?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralpho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, neighbour, you know, eating, drinking, and sleeping are three; t'other two are best known to myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wou'dbe.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm sorry Mr. Guzzle, you are so igno∣rant of the necessary qualifications of a member of the house of burgesses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Guzzle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you old dog, I knew before Ral∣pho told me. To convince you, eating, drinking and sleeping, are three; fighting and lying are t'others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wou'dbe.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why fighting and lying?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Guzzle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, because you are not fit for a bur∣gess, unless you'll fight; suppose a man that values himself upon boxing, should stand in the lobby, ready cock'd and prim'd, and knock you down, and bung up both your eyes for a fortnight, you'd be ashamed to shew your face in the house, and be living at our expence all the time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wou'dbe.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why lying?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Guzzle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because, when you have been at Williams∣burg, for six or seven weeks, under pretence of serv∣ing your county, and come back, says I to you, what news? none at all, says you; what have you
<PB N="23" REF="034158_0020_0FFC844F15A14310"/>
been about? says I,—says you—and so you must tell some damned lie, sooner than say you have been do∣ing nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wou'dbe.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Guzzle, I'll make it a point of duty to dispatch the business, and my study to promote the good of my county.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Guzzle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, damn it, you all promise mighty fair, but the devil a bit do you perform; there's Strut∣about, now, he'll promise to move mountains. He'll make the rivers navigable, and bring the tide over the tops of the hills, for a vote.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Strutabout.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may depend, Mr. Guzzle, I'll perform whatever I promise.</P>

<P>Well, commend me to Mr. Wou'dbe, I say,—I nately like the man; he's mighty good to all his poor neighbours, and when he comes into a poor body's house, he's so free and so funny, is'nt he, old man?

<P>Nothing could have afforded me more pleasure than your letter; I read it to the people, and can with pleasure assure you, it gave them infi∣nite satisfaction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>My sole motive in declaring myself was to serve you, and if I am the means of your gaining your election with honour, I shall be satisfied.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wou'dbe.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have always been extremely kind, sir, but I could not enjoy the success I promised my∣self, without your participation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have little inclination to the service; you know my aversion to a public life, Wou'dbe, and how little I have ever courted the people for the trou∣blesome office they have hitherto imposed upon me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wou'dbe.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe you enjoy as much domestic happiness as any person, and that your aversion to a public life proceeds from the pleasure you find at home. But, sir, it surely is the duty of every man who has abilities to serve his country, to take up the burden, and bear it with patience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know it is needless to argue with you upon this head: you are determined I shall serve with you, I find.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wou'dbe.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am; and therefore let's take the pro∣perest methods to insure success.</P>

<P>I will; till then, adieu.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall expect you. It would give me great pleasure if Worthy would be more anxious than he appears to be upon this occasion; conscious of his abilities and worth, he scorns to ask a vote for any person but me; well, I must turn the tables on him, and solicit as strongly in his favour.</P>

<P>Well, neighbour, I have come to see you on purpose to know how votes went at the treat yesterday.</P>

<P>I was not there; but I've seen neighbour Guzzle this morning, and he says, Sir John gives the matter up to Mr. Worthy and Mr. Wou'dbe</P>

<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Worthy! does he declare, huzza, my boys! well, I'm proud our county may choose two without being obliged to have one of those jackanapes at the head of it, faith: Who are you for now, neighbour?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julip.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe I shall vote for the two old ones, and tho' I said I was for Sir John, it was because I
<PB N="44" REF="034158_0041_0FFC841E30196A60"/>
lik'd neither of the others; but since Mr. Worthy will serve us, why, to be sartin its our duty to send Wou'dbe and him.</P>

<P>Hah, faith, now you speak like a man; you are a man after my own heart: give me your hand.</P>

<P>At your service, sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I need not, I suppose, gentlemen, inform you that I have entered the list with my old compe∣titors, and have determined to stand a poll at the next election. If you were in the croud yesterday, my friend Wou'dbe, I doubt not, made a declaration of my intentions to the people.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>We know it, thank heaven, Mr. Worthy, tho' neither of us were there: as I did not like some of the candidates I did not choose to be persecuted for a vote that I was resolved never to bestow upon them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julip.</SPEAKER>
<P>My rule is never to taste of a man's liquor unless I'm his friend, and therefore, I stay'd at home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my honest friend, I am proud to find that you still preserve your usual independence. Is it possible Captain, that the people can be so missed, as to reject Wou'dbe, and elect Strutabout in his room?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know, Mr. Worthy, how it is, as long as the liquor is running, so long they'll be Mr. Strut∣about's
<PB N="45" REF="034158_0042_0FFC841BEF7385A0"/>
friends, but when the day comes, I'm think∣ing it will be another case.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm sorry, my countymen, for the sake of a little toddy, can be induced to behave in a manner so contradictory to the candour and integrity which always should prevail among mankind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's so, sir, you may depend upon it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julip.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm a thinking it is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, gentlemen, will you give me leave to ask you. how far you think my declaring will be of service to Mr. Wou'dbe?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your declaring has already silenced Sir John Toddy; and I doubt not, but Strutabout and Small∣hopes will lose many votes by it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Has Sir John declined? poor Sir John is a weak man, but he has more virtues to recommend him than either of the others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Julip.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I think, Mr. Worthy, and I'll be so bold as to tell you that, had you not set up, Mr. Wou'dbe and Sir John should have had my vote.</P>

<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was I a constituent, instead of a candidate, I should do the same.</P>

<STAGE>Meanwell and Trueman, meeting.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mean.</SPEAKER>
<P>MR. Trueman, I am happy to see you. In times like these, of war and danger, almost every man is suspicious even of his friend; but with you I may converse with the utmost confidence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>True.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Meanwell, I know your heart, and am sorry that any man can suspect its purity; but our case is much the same.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mean.</SPEAKER>
<P>What? are you too accused of toryism?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>True.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am indeed. Unfortunately, I have some enemies who have raised the cry against me. And what is worse, I fear the consequences will be serious, and a little uncommon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mean.</SPEAKER>
<P>How?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>True.</SPEAKER>
<P>They will be bad indeed if they cause the loss of the girl I love. To your friendly bosom I may trust the secrets of my heart. The lovely Mira, daughter of our old neighbour Brazen has won my affections. You know her beauteous form; but that is but an image of her soul, its more charming inhabi∣tant. I had seen and loved her: her father declared his approbation of my passion, and encouraged me to proceed. Heaven seemed to promise me success, and the idol of my soul had with blushing tenderness con∣sented
<PB N="56" REF="034158_0052_0FFC8405786D53E8"/>
to be my bride. But all our hopes may pro∣bably be blasted by this unfortunate circumstance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mean.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>True.</SPEAKER>
<P>It cannot be doubted. Her father is a vio∣lent patriot without knowing the meaning of the word. He understands little or nothing beyond a dice-box and race-field, but thinks he knows every thing; and woe be to him that contradicts him! His politi∣cal notions are a system of perfect anarchy, but he reigns in his own family with perfect despotism. He is fully resolved that nobody shall tyrannize over him, but very content to tyrannize over others. I happened in conversation to oppose some of his doc∣tines of a state of nature and liberty without restraint, and he blazed out immediately like a flash of gun∣powder. I endeavored to moderate his anger; but as reason and he can never be reconciled, I am afraid my sins will never be forgiven; besides, I have a bit∣ter enemy and rival in Captain Flash.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mean.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, that is the drawcansir of modern times; a fellow who pretends to cat the smoke of a cannon fresh from the mouth, and to kill all the enemies of his country, as Caligula would the Roman people, at one blow. But I believe he's a coward at bottom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>True.</SPEAKER>
<P>So do I. But Old Brazen is persuaded that not even Washington is his parallel. As I pretend not to extravagant valour, the captain thinks me a puny milksop, and judges it very great presumption in me to pretend to the lady he adores. I expect he has assisted the old man's prepossession against me; and, by his assertions, convinced him I am a tory:— But this is certain, the old gentleman declared that I
<PB N="57" REF="034158_0053_0FFC84033142A438"/>
should never enter his doors with his consent again, and moreover has commanded his daughter to think no more of having me for her husband.</P>

<P>What a pity it is that all heads are not ca∣pable of receiving the benign influence of the princi∣ples of liberty—some are too weak to bear it, and be∣come thoroughly intoxicated. The cause of my coun∣try appears as dear to me as to those who most pas∣sionately declaim on the subject. The rays of the sun of freedom, which is now rising, have warmed my heart; but I hope my zeal against tyranny will not be shewn by bawling against it, but by serving my country against her enemies; and never may I sig∣nalize my attachment to liberty by persecuting inno∣cent men, only because they differ in opinion with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>True.</SPEAKER>
<P>It seems for this very reason you are not ac∣counted a patriot; but truth will at last prevail, the faithful heart be applauded, and the noisy hypocrite stripped of the mask of patriotism.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mean.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope so; and therefore truth, plain truth, shall be the only shield I will use against my foes. Men who aim at power without merit, must conceal the meanness of their souls by noisy and passionate speeches in favour of every thing which is the cur∣rent opinion of the day; but real patriots are mild, and secretly anxious for their country, but modest in expressions of zeal. They are industrious in the pub∣lic service, but claim no glory to themselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>True.</SPEAKER>
<P>May the armies of America be always led by such as these! Thus will the power of Britain be
<PB N="58" REF="034158_0054_0FFC8400F2A243D8"/>
overthrown, and peace with liberty return—May men like these conduct our government, and happi∣ness, in the train of independence, will bless the smil∣ing land! But before this can be accomplished many temporary evils must be supported with patience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mean.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and this under which we now labour among the rest. But what do you propose to do in the case of your lovely Mira? you won't give up the pursuit?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>True.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give up the pursuit? When I do, may I be hanged as a traitor to love! But it seems a little dif∣ficult at present. I have taken the liberty to use your servant already in the business. As he very lately came into this part of the country, and possesses a ve∣ry genteel air, I thought he might easily pass for a gentleman with old Brazen. I equip'd him there∣fore as an officer, and sent him to the house of the old gentleman; and ordered him to pass himself for a travelling captain, and to wait for an opportunity of delivering a letter to Mira. He executed the com∣mission with fidelity, and brought me an answer from her, in which she communicates to me all that I have told you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mean.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what do you intend to do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>True.</SPEAKER>
<P>With your permission I'll make use of your servant upon a second embassy.</P>

<P>By all means; but what do you propose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>In the pursuit of honorable love few things are reprehensible. I shall intreat her to elope with me into a neighbouring government, where Hymen shall make us one.</P>

<P>The ungracious treatment that some Scotch∣men have met with, the illiberal reflections cast out against them all, give little hope of their attachment to a country, or to a people, where and with whom they have already tasted the bitter herb of persecu∣tion: some there are, who have behaved well, con∣form'd to the public will, nor given any cause of of∣fence; yet even those have not met with the common offices of civility among us.</P>

<P>Dreadful, sir, why, they deserve to be hang'd. I was told they were in a private room, shut up.

<P>An't please your honour, happening to meet with Mr. Pettifogger, the attorney, I shewed it to him. He told me it was a precept, and that I must leave a copy of it at every place I went to, but being a poor hand at writing, thof I have pretty good larn∣ing too, I bethought me as how it would do as well to leave the thing itself, so I gave the paper to that gentleman.

<P>A letter! Lord, sir, never ask a letter from your mistress. 'Tis the worst way of procuring a ten∣der of the affections in the world. A woman, when she commits her sentiments to paper, is so very cau∣tious, so nicely circumspect, lest the warmth that animates the expressions of love, should carry her be∣yond the usual prudence of her sex, that the glow∣ing ardor of the passions, gives way to a cold prudish reserve, which I call the grave of love; tho' some are pleased to call it the nursery of virtue. How<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver, sir, your mistress assents to all your proposals, and here are my credentials.

<STAGE>Enter Meanwell, with a letter in his hand.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mean.</SPEAKER>
<P>My old friend, Mr. Worthy, writes me that his nephew, George, had arrived from England, about the beginning of our public disturbances; that being too free in discovering his political opinions, he was cited before one of their courts. To avoid the treatment he expected to receive from these guardians of the rights and liberties of their fellow-citizens, he absconded without informing his friends of his route or designs. I am requested to make en∣quiry after him. We have no asylum with us to which persecuted integrity would fly for shelter. No, no, he is not with us.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter Groom.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Groom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Trueman presents his compliments to your honour: says he is gone off to Mr. Brazen's, and desires you will follow him as soon as possible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mean.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(looking at his watch.)</STAGE>
Six is the hour. Tell your master, I'll be with him at the time ap∣pointed.
<STAGE>Exit Groom.</STAGE>
My butler just informed me that an old tenant of mine, formerly one of my best and most faithful do∣mestics,
<PB N="115" REF="034158_0111_0FFC86DE7ABE0660"/>
has sent to me very pressingly to call on him in my way to the wedding. He has urgent business with me. I must comply with his request, and not to be too late, I'll prepare immediately for my journey. Who's there?
<STAGE>Enter a servant.</STAGE>
Where's Tickle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Servant.</SPEAKER>
<P>An't please your honour, I don't know. But since he turned captain, I suppose as how he's after some of his wild vagaries. I saw him go out not long ago, with somebody wrap'd up in a gown.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mean.</SPEAKER>
<P>You did! Farther enquiry should be made into this. Do you think any of the servants can tell whither he is gone?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Servant.</SPEAKER>
<P>They say it is a profound secret, but I thinks your honour, it can't be after any good.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mean.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't be too suspicious of a fellow-servant, but which of them told you it was a secret?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Servant.</SPEAKER>
<P>The cook, your honour: says he to me, Mr. Pickle is a fly cock, says he, and knows what to do, says he, but I hope your honour won't tell as how I told you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mean.</SPEAKER>
<P>Get ye gone, and tell the cook to come hither.
<STAGE>(Exit servant.)</STAGE>
That young man is out of the way at a very improper time, and may probably have some trick in view. He appears to be a faithful and honest, and at the same time the most ingenious and genteel servant, I ever saw; but nevertheless, it is not impossible but he may have a mixture of the rake in his disposition. Let me see, what girl is there hereabouts whom he can have in view? It is not my wish to pry into all the actions of my servants, but no improper conduct must be permitted.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><PB N="116" REF="034158_0112_0FFC86DC2DF0BA18"/><HI>Enter the Cook.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mean.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, sir, can you give me any account of Mr Pickle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cook.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your honour won't be offended, I hope. I don't wish to raise mischief against a brother servant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mean.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know my authority when I choose to exert it on a proper occasion, must not be disputed. I understand that Pickle has gone out with some per∣son muffled up in a cloke, and as secrecy is generally the veil of iniquity, I am confident he has some evil design. If you know any thing of his schemes, I in∣sist upon your faithfully disclosing them to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cook.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, indeed, your honour, he never told me any thing about it; but I have good reason to be∣lieve, and I'll tell your honour all I know about it; for tho' I am a poor sarvant, I hope I may be an ho∣nest man. Don't your honour think a sarvant has a soul to be sav'd as well as great folks?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mean.</SPEAKER>
<P>They have indeed, and for that reason should be attentive to their duty. But my time is short, be quick in giving your information.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cook.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, your honour must know the butler is gone with Mr. Pickle, and he wants me and John the scullion, to go too. The butler told me Mr. Pickle was going to be married, and we were to be the wit∣nesses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mean.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if that was all, where was the neccessity of secrecy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cook.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! your honour ha'n't heard all yet! This marriage, the butler said, is to be all a trick. He is to marry her with your name, and the butler is to be the parson, so that Mr. Pickle will gain his ends
<PB N="117" REF="034158_0113_0FFA64C9897E2148"/>
without any wedding in reality; the butler said as how he did not approve such doings, and he would endeavour to let you know in time to prevent it.— Howsomdever, as he is gone too, without telling your honour any thing about it, I suppose Mr. Pickle may have overpersuaded him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mean.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bless me! what a scheme of iniquity! But what girl is this he intends to deceive?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cook.</SPEAKER>
<P>Melinda Heartfree, sir, the daughter of your honour's old servant John. Ah! he is a good old soul, and dame Heartfree too: they are so kind and good, every body loves them; and the young girl, too, is as good a creature, and as pretty as ever a man might wish to see. Indeed, your honour, I think it would be a pity to do her any harm.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mean.</SPEAKER>
<P>I applaud your sentiments, and wish that many in higher stations, who delight in betraying innocence and beauty, could think as justly. To pre∣vent the intended villany no time must be lost. Pickle and the butler may expect you now. You shall go with me. I'll not stay to dress for the wedding; when suffering virtue is to be relieved, or innocence protected, the moments are too precious to be dedi∣cated to ceremony.

<P>I cannot doubt your honour's word: But how came he acquainted with Milly?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pick.</SPEAKER>
<P>Love, tho' blind, by instinct finds his way. I confess, with shame, that when I first saw this beau∣teous maid, I was tempted to entertain dishonourable designs upon her, but I found her pure as spotless snows, and firm as adamant against all improper pro∣posals, tho' soft as wax to the impressions of tender∣ness. I have always wished to find a maiden who could love me for myself alone; in this artless fair I
<PB N="125" REF="034158_0121_0FFC86C95EFDC2F8"/>
have found one, who when my base attempt to im∣pose upon her by a pretended marriage, was disco∣ver'd, mov'd by affection, forgave it all, and deign'd to receive the repentant sinner, tho' seemingly poor and humble. To her then, I bow, and she, if you object not, shall be the partner of my future life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>All this is new to me; but the gentleman is welcome to Milly, with all my heart. However, as it is come to this, another secret must be explained, for that girl is no more my daughter than I am a gover∣nor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>All.</SPEAKER>
<P>How?</P>

<P>Yes, your honour; but a short story will make all clear. You remember you had a sister once who is now dead?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mean.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, one whom I have always remembered with lively regret. She marri'd unhappily.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>There, your honour, was the beginning of all the mischief. You know Mr. Spendall, her hus∣band was a very extravagant man. He liv'd at a great rate, and gam'd and horse-raced it very much, so that he soon brought himself to ruin. But that was not all, for, besides all this, he treated the lady, his wife, very ill, indeed. She had brought him a fine fortune, and he had spent it: so he thought her heart always up∣braided him for it, and that made him worse, but Lord help the poor lady, she was so sweet and kind hearted, she bore no malice to any body.</P>

Your tale touches me too ten∣derly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>No wonder it should, your honour, but as I was about to say, the poor lady you know had a child, which was generally supposed to have died when it was two months old. Her husband was at that time gone upon a long journey which he took in∣deed to keep out of the way of his creditors, and the report was spread to deceive him, and a pretended funeral was had.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mean.</SPEAKER>
<P>I remember it, and I attended on the oc∣casion, but I did not examine the coffin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Neither did any body else: but the poor lady had brought the child to me. I shall never for∣get her looks. It was not long before she died. John, says she, I know I shall shortly die, my heart is bro∣ken, and I am going to a better world than this. My only tie to earth is this tender infant: may she never feel her mother's sorrow! This infant I cannot have in the house of a man who has forgotten all the feelings of a husband, who would educate her in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e, and perhaps leave her to beggary. I can pre∣serve her from the pollution of bad example only by removing her from him. With you she will be plain and vir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uous. When I am dead, and my husband is no more, who I know when alive, will never permit her to reside with him, convey her to my brother if he shall then be living. I know his generous soul: he will be indeed a father to her: as a proof of her birth, present him with this picture of his wretched sister, which he gave her himself. Here it is, an't please your honour.

<HEAD>THE FIRST BOOK OF OVID's METAMORPHOSES, TRANSLATED.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>MY mind impells me first of forms to tell,</L>
<L>Which being chang'd, to diff'rent bodies fell.</L>
<L>Ye Gods, (for you this wond'rous change effect,)</L>
<L>Inspire my lays, my arduous task direct.</L>

<L>In strains continued to the times we know.</L>

<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<L>Before th' extensive sea and earth were made,</L>
<L>And heav'n o'er all its azure mantle spread,</L>
<L>Thro'out, the face of nature was the same,</L>
<L>Rude and confus'd, and Chaos was its name.</L>
<L>A sluggish weight, a rough unfinish'd world,</L>
<L>And jarring atoms into contact hurl'd.</L>
<L>No sun as yet had spread abroad the day,</L>
<L>Or chear'd the world with his enliv'ning ray;</L>
<L>No moon as yet her monthly round begun,</L>
<L>Her horns increasing as her course she run;</L>
<L>No earth suspended in the ambient air,</L>
<L>Self-pois'd, as yet had six'd her station there;</L>
<L><PB N="134" REF="034158_0130_0FFC86B3D5C72A30"/>Nor had the sea her circling arms stretch'd forth</L>
<L>Along the margin of her sister earth.—</L>
<L>Where'er was land, the sea and air appear,</L>
<L>Restless the earth and sea, quite dark the air.</L>
<L>Its proper form with nothing yet remain'd,</L>
<L>This was by that, and that by this restrain'd.</L>
<L>For deeds discordant in one body blend,</L>
<L>The cold with hot, and wet with dry contend,</L>
<L>The soft with hard, the heavy with the light:</L>
<L>A God and kinder nature stop'd their fight:</L>
<L>Earth from the skies, from water earth he clears,</L>
<L>And heav'n refin'd from dusky air, appears:</L>
<L>Which when he'd sever'd from the dark abyss,</L>
<L>He plac'd at distance, and he bound in peace.</L>
<L>The fiery meteors of the convex heav'n,</L>
<L>To which no heavy particles were giv'n,</L>
<L>Sprung upwards, chose of all the top extreme,</L>
<L>And shone aloft in eminence supreme.</L>
<L>The air, in lightness next, is next in place;</L>
<L>The earth more heavy, drags around its face</L>
<L>The larger elements, and forc'd by sate,</L>
<L>Is press'd together by its mighty weight.</L>

<L>When he, (whoever of the Gods he was,)</L>

<L>He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>de the sea to spread, with winds to roar,</L>
<L>And 'round the border'd earth imprint a shore.</L>
<L>He added springs, and pools immense, and lakes;</L>
<L>With winding banks the rapid river breaks;</L>
<L>While part subsides into the earth, its source,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the sea pursues its various course,</L>
<L><PB N="135" REF="034158_0131_0FFC86B251FC1488"/>Mix'd with the world of waters, beats the shore,</L>
<L>And in its narrow limits runs no more.</L>
<L>The plains he levels, low the valley lies,</L>
<L>The forests foliate, rocky mountains rise.</L>
<L>And as two zones the northern sky contains,</L>
<L>And two the south, a fifth more hot remains:</L>
<L>God thus in number all his work divides,</L>
<L>O'er its own region ev'ry clime presides:</L>
<L>The middle, scorch'd with never-ceasing heat,</L>
<L>A dreary land unknown to human feet:</L>
<L>Deep snow o'er two its chilly reign extends;</L>
<L>In other two, so well the Godhead blends</L>
<L>The heat with cold, that neither can exceed</L>
<L>The temp'rate bounds his wisdom has decreed.</L>
<L>On all these zones reclines the lofty air,</L>
<L>Which in its weight surpasses fire, as far</L>
<L>As earth the water: he, whose will is fate,</L>
<L>Commands that there the clouds and fogs should wait</L>
<L>The dreadful thunders, and the cooling wind,</L>
<L>Nor wou'd the God permit that unconfin'd</L>
<L>The winds should wander thro' the spacious air;</L>
<L>E'en now so great their rage they soon wou'd tear</L>
<L>The world apart, without the maker's care.</L>
<L>When each, by providence, assign'd his place,</L>
<L>Commands his whirlwinds in a different space,</L>
<L>To bright Aurora, Eurus wings his way,</L>
<L>And takes his station with the dawn of day,</L>
<L>To Nabathaean realms, and Persian hills,</L>
<L>Whose summit first the beams of morning feels.</L>
<L>The regions warm'd by Sol's declining ray,</L>
<L>To pleasing Zephyrus the nearest lay.</L>
<L>Dread Boreas, seiz'd on Scythia's frozen plains,</L>
<L>And o'er the gloomy north in horror reigns.</L>
<L>The lands oppos'd to his domain we find</L>
<L>Are wet with constant clouds and rainy southern wind.</L>
<L><PB N="136" REF="034158_0132_0FFC86AF40084918"/>O'er these he plac'd the aether clear, serene,</L>
<L>Devoid of weight, or speck, of dross terrene.</L>
<L>Soon as these sev'ral things their places found,</L>
<L>And God had giv'n to each its proper bound,</L>
<L>The stars which long beneath the mass did lie,</L>
<L>Sprung forth, and glitter'd, thro' the spangled sky.</L>
<L>And that no region might hereafter be</L>
<L>Of animals depriv'd, above we see</L>
<L>The stars, and persons of the gods, alone,</L>
<L>Celestial forms possess the heav'nly throne.</L>
<L>For cleanly fish, the waters he design'd;</L>
<L>To beasts the earth: to birds the air assign'd.</L>
<L>A better animal must yet be found,</L>
<L>Of soul capacious, and of sense profound;</L>
<L>Ordain'd o'er all to hold the sov'reign sway,</L>
<L>A man is made; and man the rest obey.</L>
<L>Whether the pow'r whom we Creator call</L>
<L>Of this fair world, grand architect of all,</L>
<L>From seeds divine, produc'd the human frame,</L>
<L>Or new made earth which from the other came,</L>

<L>Might yet the seeds of kindred heav'n retain,</L>
<L>To which Japetus' son, with water mix'd,</L>
<L>The image of the ruling gods affix'd.</L>
<L>While other animals their heads decline</L>
<L>To earth; to man he gave a face divine:</L>
<L>Bade him sublimely tow'rds the sky to raise</L>
<L>His looks erect, and on the stars to gaze.</L>

<L><PB N="137" REF="034158_0133_0FFC86ADA6AA77D0"/>No punishment was then, nor pallid dread,</L>

<L>Safe, without punishment, they all remain.</L>
<L>No pines as yet descended to the main,</L>

<L>From culture free the earth it's harvest yields,</L>

<HEAD>THE RAM: A TALE. Written about the time when the Ladies wore remarka∣bly high head-dresses.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>BUTLER! thou dear facetious wight,</L>
<L>Who know'st so well to paint a fight,</L>
<L>Whose Muse cou'd flow when battles rage,</L>
<L>Where bears, dogs, men, and all engage,</L>
<L>Who mad'st advance, or mad'st retreat</L>
<L>With ease the beating and the beat,</L>
<L>With equal caution, equal skill,</L>
<L>That none were killed, or could kill;</L>
<L>Oh lend thy pen, thou name divine,</L>
<L>To paint a battle fierce as thine:</L>
<L>A battle which the Grecian bard,</L>
<L>To celebrate would find too hard;</L>
<L>Altho' his mighty genius taught,</L>
<L>How gods with men together fought;</L>
<L>How frogs and mice engage in fray,</L>
<L>For honour they, as men for pay.</L>
<L>Ye tuneful Nine—but hush the pray'r,</L>
<L>The nymphs must not attend us here;</L>
<L>For in this battle, such our fate,</L>
<L>As truth demands, we must relate,</L>
<L>How ladies fight, how fierce they are,</L>
<L>When battling for a suit of hair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The tale begins: but first, I trow,</L>
<L>Time, place, and all, you want to know:</L>
<L>But ladies' names, I hold it certain,</L>
<L><PB N="168" REF="034158_0163_0FFC8668099AC938"/>Except when fortune smiles, and then</L>
<L>I'll blab 'em forth as soon as men.</L>
<L>Two ladies at their toilet sat,</L>
<L>One talk'd of this, the other that—</L>
<L>But stop; the one I'll nickname Molly,</L>
<L>And for the rhyme, the other Dolly.</L>
</LG>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Molly.</SPEAKER>
<L>Oh me! 'tis horrid, quite too low</L>
<L>(Her cheeks with rage began to glow.)</L>
<L>'Tis frightful, wants a pound of wool,</L>
<L>The maker surely was a fool.</L>
<L>Then Dolly look'd, and peevish said,</L>
<L>My pack's too low by half a head;</L>
<L>My hair's so thin, de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce take the pin,</L>
<L>I scarce with squeezing get it in.</L>
<L>'Twill never do: pray now look here.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Molly.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis horrid shocking, child, I swear,</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dolly.</SPEAKER>
<L>What's to be done?</L>

<SPEAKER>Molly.</SPEAKER>
<L>I do not know,</L>
<L>But thus to church I'll never go.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dolly.</SPEAKER>
<L>Nor I. In pet she instant laid</L>
<L>Low down the honours of her head,</L>
<L>In other words, the pins, the curls,</L>
<L>The plaits, the woolpack, she unfurls.</L>
<L>Then Dolly springing from her chair,</L>
<L>(I dread to tell as you to hear)</L>
<L>Oh fatal, fatal, fatal Ire!</L>
<L>The pack was instant in the fire.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Molly.</SPEAKER>
<L>Dear Dolly, child, for shame, for shame,</L>
<L>Impatient folks are much to blame;</L>
<L>The pack would yet have done, had you</L>
<L>But done as I intend to do.</L>
<L>I'll get some wool, and cram and stuff</L>
<L>My pack until it's full enough.</L>
<L>Let's go my girl; we'll shear a sheep,</L>
<L>Please God, I will, before I sleep.</L>

<SPEAKER>Dolly.</SPEAKER>
<L>I'll go, dear Molly, and assist,</L>
<L>I'll have a pack two foot at least.</L>
<L>Their hats and mantles on they drew,</L>
<L>And instant to the meadow flew.</L>
<L>A vicious ram was there confin'd,</L>
<L>And kept apart from all his kind;</L>
<L>The ewes, and lambs, and other sheep,</L>
<L>Were brouzing on a mountain steep.</L>
<L>The hoary chief our heroines saw;</L>
<L>He gaz'd, he paus'd, was struck with awe.</L>
<L>When Molly spoke: What horns? what horns?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dolly.</SPEAKER>
<L>What charming wool his back adorns?</L>
<L>His horns you see are twisted 'round,</L>
<L>And quite unfit to give a wound.</L>
<L>I'll pen him up in yonder corner.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Molly.</SPEAKER>
<L>I wish the creature may not horn her.</L>
<L>But I will join the grand design,</L>
<L>And half the glory shall be mine.</L>
<L>She nearer drew, as thus she said;</L>
<L>The ram, surpriz'd, turn'd tail, and fled;</L>
<L>And seem'd quite passive, 'til he found,</L>
<L>By thus retreating, he lost ground,</L>
<L>That still the foe came pressing on,</L>
<L>As cowards do when battle's won.</L>
<L>He fac'd about; the ladies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ew,</L>
<L>As sometimes men of mettle do.</L>
<L>The ram to feeding went, and then</L>
<L>The rallied foe came on again.</L>
<L>Molly, the boldest of the two,</L>
<L>Would try what stratagem could do.</L>
<L>Let's drive him slowly: I'll get near,</L>
<L>And sudden charge him in the rear;</L>
<L>I'll seize behind, you charge before,</L>
<L>Grapple his horns, and then we're sure.</L>

<L>Heroes may boast of battles won,</L>
<L>Of feats by mighty warriors done,</L>
<L>Of marches, counter-marches too,</L>
<L>And arts of war they never knew;</L>
<L>Of defiles, ambuscades, and stuff,</L>
<L>And skill not worth a pinch of snuff,</L>
<L>View Molly's generalship and plan,</L>
<L>Then beat it, heroes, if you can.</L>
<L>Molly, I say, mov'd slowly on,</L>
<L>To where the first attack begun.</L>
<L>The ram majestic march'd along,</L>
<L>As some proud puppy thro' a throng,</L>
<L>But soon the crafty foes he feels,</L>
<L>Attacking both at head and heels.</L>
<L>One seiz'd his horn, and one his wool;</L>
<L>Now, now, she cried, my pack is full.</L>
<L>Ah! bootless boast, ah! prospect vain!</L>
<L>What toils? what mischiefs yet remain?</L>
<L>Thus, while the shouts of conquest rise,</L>
<L>By random shot, the victor dies.</L>
<L>For soon the ram submission scorns,</L>
<L>With desp'rate jerks he loos'd his horns;</L>
<L>And turning 'round, disdaining fear,</L>
<L>Charg'd home the plund'rer of his rear.</L>
<L>Just then, poor Molly, at a pull,</L>
<L>Had strove to fill her hands with wool.</L>
<L>The thickest fleece in vain she wrench'd,</L>
<L>Tho' to the root, her fingers clench'd.</L>
<L>The ram began to kick and jump,</L>
<L>Miss Molly holding still his rump;</L>
<L>Her hands in wool entangled fast;</L>
<L>But from her gripe he broke at last,</L>
<L>Then fir'd with rage for injur'd honour,</L>
<L>He swore to wreak revenge upon her;</L>
<L><PB N="189" REF="034158_0166_0FFC8661BB5E4DA0"/>And rush'd to butt with desp'rate head:</L>
<L>Then Molly from his wrath had fled;</L>
<L>But 'ere she cou'd begin the race,</L>
<L>He fiercely struck her, in that place</L>
<L>Where scoundrels take their due desert,</L>
<L>And none but cowards will be hurt:</L>
<L>'Twas there he struck: Oh, fatal case!</L>
<L>Prone fell poor Molly on her face.</L>
<L>What beauties then the maid reveal'd?</L>
<L>What charms which envious dress conceal'd?</L>
<L>But not for me a heaven to paint;</L>
<L>My pencil's dull, my colouring faint.</L>
<L>Now, luckless chance! as thus she lay,</L>
<L>And call'd for help, in dire dismay,</L>
<L>The ram, his victory pursuing,</L>
<L>As if he meant to work her ruin,</L>
<L>With angry front her head attacks:</L>
<L>Off fell the heaps of wool and flax:</L>
<L>The powder flew, false hair and curls,</L>
<L>Demolish'd all, around he whirls.</L>
<L>But in the pack his horns were caught;</L>
<L>He toss'd, he rag'd, to clear them, thought</L>
<L>In vain: with hair he blinds his eyes,</L>
<L>And clouds of powder 'round him rise;</L>
<L>Such clouds as oft on festal night,</L>
<L>Clothe empty heads in radiant white.</L>
<L>Amaz'd, confus'd, perplex'd and vex'd,</L>
<L>Like preacher who forgets his text,</L>
<L>Now did he rub his head, now fling,</L>
<L>Mad as a bear around a ring.</L>
<L>But nought would do: around his horns</L>
<L>Safe lodg'd the pack, his fury scorns.</L>
<L>He thought the devil his foes had join'd,</L>
<L>The hopes of farther fame resign'd,</L>
<L><PB N="190" REF="034158_0167_0FFC865F79E1FE40"/>And waiting not to hear the drum beat,</L>
<L>In haste retreated from the combat.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Dolly, who all the time, amaz'd,</L>
<L>Upon the dreadful battle gaz'd,</L>
<L>When now she saw the conqu'ror yield,</L>
<L>Bearing the trophies of the field,</L>
<L>To Molly ran, in haste; she cries,</L>
<L>The foe is gone, dear sister rise.</L>
<L>Then help me up, she groaning said,</L>
<L>May I be doom'd to die a maid</L>
<L>If 'ere I fight with rams again:</L>
<L>My curls are scatter'd o'er the plain,</L>
<L>Quite dirty all, my pack he bears,</L>
<L>And on his head triumphant wears.</L>
<L>The pack that's gone was quite too small;</L>
<L>How then will look, no pack at all?</L>
<L>Fashion in every thing prevails,</L>
<L>We all are lost, if fashion fails.</L>
<L>While others go with packs so large,</L>
<L>They seem their heads to overcharge;</L>
<L>And ladies' lofty tops aspire</L>
<L>As high as grenadiers or high'r;</L>
<L>Shall I, a little humble chit,</L>
<L>Appear no taller than five feet?</L>
<L>While others, powder'd, curl'd, and friz'd,</L>
<L>Their locks do furbelow and twist,</L>
<L>'Till like a quick-set hedge they shew,</L>
<L>Or bunch of briars cloth'd in snow;</L>
<L>Shall I be seen with plain comb'd hair?</L>
<L>A shame like that I must not bear.</L>
<L>Oh woeful chance! the church to enter</L>
<L>In such a garb, I cannot venture.</L>
<L>If people only went to pray'r,</L>
<L>Indeed, for dress I should not care.</L>
<L><PB N="191" REF="034158_0168_0FFC865C4959B8F8"/>But belles you know, there are, and beaux,</L>
<L>Who place their glory in their clothes,</L>
<L>Who go to church to shew their beauty;</L>
<L>Not humbly to perform their duty.</L>
<L>How should I in their eyes appear?</L>
<L>The end of this I ne'er should hear.</L>
<L>Then Dolly said, your grief restrain,</L>
<L>My dear, since now it is in vain,</L>
<L>And let us try to make the best; on't;</L>
<L>Else they, indeed, may make a jest on't.</L>
<L>Shall yonder ram?—as thus she spoke,</L>
<L>The ram, at length, the pack had broke;</L>
<L>Before his horns the texture yields,</L>
<L>Pins, wool, and hair embrown the fields.</L>
<L>At once the conversation ceas'd,</L>
<L>Poor Dolly's courage quite decreas'd,</L>
<L>And Molly quak'd, who saw the foe</L>
<L>Prepar'd again for deadly blow.</L>
<L>They view his threat'ning horns with fear,</L>
<L>Nor did they dare to venture near.</L>
<L>'Till he in pity to their case,</L>
<L>Retir'd contemptuous from the place.</L>
<L>He left, with scorn, the tatter'd pack</L>
<L>Which he cou'd not, but they might lack.</L>

<L>The scatter'd relies then they gather,</L>
<L>Here lay a curl, and there a feather,</L>
<L>And here the pack to pieces torn—</L>
<L>They pick them up, and o'er them mourn.</L>
<L>With heavy hearts they haste away;</L>
<L>Compell'd, that day, at home to stay.</L>
<L>There sad they sit, and mope, and pine;</L>
<L>Each thinks, what conquests had been mine</L>
<L><PB N="192" REF="034158_0169_0FFC865A8EB10C20"/>Of lover's hearts, at church to-day,</L>

<HEAD>A LETTER From the Devil to his Son.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>MY ever dear and fav'rite son,</L>
<L>I've heard of late the deeds you've done.</L>
<L>Go on, my boy, keep true to me,</L>
<L>And I'll keep faith, depend, with thee.</L>
<L>For sure, I never yet did know,</L>
<L>In air above, or earth below,</L>
<L>A son so wedded to my will,</L>
<L>So lost to virtue, prone to ill;</L>
<L>So ev'ry way my son and heir,</L>
<L>Or fitter for promotion here.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Know then, that I, of special grace,</L>
<L>Willing to give my boy a place,</L>
<L>Late summon'd up my swarthy crew,</L>
<L>To know what seat best suited you.</L>
<L>All prick'd their ears, except a black,</L>
<L>Who ears had not; he shewed his back▪</L>
<L>"No make him overseer," says he,</L>
<L>"For dat man, he been killey me;"</L>
<L>His back, his head, his meagre face,</L>
<L>Drew pity from the hellish race;</L>
<L>A murmur ran from shore to shore,</L>
<L>And hell was instant in a roar.</L>
<L>The clamour stay'd, a boy then cried,</L>
<L>"By him begot, by him I died."</L>
<L>An aged matron crept along,</L>
<L>And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eebly thus address'd the throng;</L>
<L><PB N="195" REF="034158_0172_0FFC8653B5DE11D0"/>"A child I bore, a child I cherish'd,</L>
<L>"And by that child at last I perish'd."</L>
<L>Such acts, my son, such deeds as these,</L>
<L>Methought th' infernal crew would please.</L>
<L>But all cried out, "'tis strange to tell,</L>
<L>"There's no place fit for him in hell,</L>
<L>"His acts so far surpass your own,</L>
<L>"They'd give him title to the throne."</L>
<L>The truth is this, my son, they fear</L>
<L>Lest you should take the Imperial chair.</L>
<L>Should that, say they, be e'er the case,</L>
<L>Hell would be soon an empty space.</L>
<L>The croud dismiss'd, a wily peer,</L>
<L>With wicked grin, malicious leer,</L>
<L>Advised to build another hell,</L>
<L>That you alone therein might dwell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now, if my son has no objection,</L>
<L>It shall be built by his direction;</L>
<L>Nay more, to give you due content,</L>
<L>I'll send you negroes to torment;</L>
<L>An overseer, or two, besides,</L>
<L>To help you cut and slash their hides▪</L>
<L>And if I did not know you well,</L>
<L>(Tho' seldom any come to hell)</L>
<L>Some women I might send; but then,</L>

<L>I WROTE, my son, to let you know</L>
<L>The seat prepared for you below.</L>
<L>I write again, my child, to tell</L>
<L>The news that's passing now in hell.</L>
<L>A fellow's here, who sets about</L>
<L>A piece of news that makes a rout:</L>
<L>He says, that when he came away,</L>
<L>My dearest boy was heard to say</L>
<L>He would repent.—Of what, my son?</L>
<L>Of all the good you've ever done?</L>
<L>For, sure I am, you'll ne'er relent,</L>
<L>Nor of one wicked deed repent.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I therefore laugh'd to hear the tale,</L>
<L>Tho' much it did with some prevail;</L>
<L>Nay more, and that is quite uncivil,</L>
<L>He says, you preach against the devil;</L>
<L>And talk of kindness, doing good,</L>
<L>And giving, to the hungry, food;</L>
<L>However, to remove all doubt,</L>
<L>I gave a little hand-bill out—</L>
<L>That all you did, or said, or thought,</L>
<L>By me was prompted, by me taught.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Take care when here, or you'll be baited,</L>

<HEAD>ANSWER TO THE WINTER PIECE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>DEAR * * * when last you wrote, remember well,</L>
<L>The charms of winter, you presum'd to tell;</L>
<L>I felt such shame (kind heaven the shame repay,)</L>
<L>As sense must feel at such a senseless lay;</L>
<L>Take no offence, for ev'ry foolish clown,</L>
<L>Since * * *'s muse has come thus hobbling down,</L>
<L>May mount his Pegasus, and laugh at those</L>
<L>Who spur at rhymes, and stumble into prose.</L>
<L>Now, you will say, that view the scholars 'round,</L>
<L>Such wild eccentric wit may oft be found,</L>
<L>Wherefore the poets should receive the bays,</L>
<L>Who sometimes sing for laughter—not for praise,</L>
<L>Thus, while poor Pegasus is flogg'd along,</L>
<L>This hums in prose a dismal dirty song;</L>
<L>That poet's fancies claim a slacken'd rein,</L>
<L>And oft run rapid o'er the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>low'ry plain,</L>
<L>Yet, as I may, permit me to make bold,</L>
<L>And ask thee, if thy muse or theme be cold?</L>
<L>I say that folly, spite of reason's voice,</L>
<L>Is now elected, and alas! thy choice;</L>
<L>And when poor reason, by some peasant thrown,</L>
<L>Shall lie neglected where he tumbled down;</L>
<L>No friend this sacred gift of heav'n to take,</L>
<L>Since e'en the learn'd, the pilgrim now forsake;</L>
<L>I here protest, whoe'er against declare</L>
<L>He should to * * * and its lord repair,</L>
<L><PB N="200" REF="034158_0177_0FFA64C11C1D0580"/>That seat 'round which the muses oft have cried,</L>
<L>In doleful strains with reason on their side;</L>
<L>O gracious Pallas, goddess of delight,</L>
<L>Vouchsafe for once at * * * to alight;</L>
<L>The air is temperate, serene, refin'd,</L>
<L>Not for a dirty, sla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tern muse designd;</L>
<L>Banish to Hottentot, the drunken whore,</L>
<L>And let her shackle prose with rhymes no more;</L>
<L>For nothing better from this muse we've had</L>
<L>Than dirty simile, and prose run mad.</L>
<L>The subject puts us in a gape, and sleep,</L>
<L>In spite of snuff, will o'er the senses creep;</L>
<L>From line to line the self-same dulness flows,</L>
<L>With not one sketch of wit to yield repose,</L>
<L>A perfect nuisance, which t' endure aright,</L>
<L>Another Argus only has the sleight.</L>
<L>In vain we hope this muse will cease her song</L>
<L>Till wisdom claps a padlock on her tongue;</L>
<L>Goddess of music; our petition hear,</L>
<L>And lend to * * * a poetic ear.</L>
<L>Dear * * *, reflect, whene'er the maggot bites,</L>
<L>And spite of fate the muse of * * * writes,</L>
<L>Myriads of critics do upon her fall,</L>
<L>In vain for measure, or for rhyme they call;</L>
<L>Since common sense by her neglected lies,</L>
<L>While virtue slumbers, and religion dies.</L>
<L>Reflect on this, and own the consequence,</L>
<L>Thus to persist must argue want of sense.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh, what repasts the stirling wits prepare?</L>
<L>We read with pleasure or with rapture hear;</L>
<L>Parnassian laurels deck the poets' brow,</L>
<L>And sages to the magic numbers bow.</L>
<L>But verse like thine the modest face inflames,</L>
<L>And yet it tickles not the lovely dames;</L>
<L><PB N="201" REF="034158_0178_0FFC8646C9395018"/>The lovely fair, endearing sex, bestow'd</L>
<L>On man, to mitigate of life the load.</L>
<L>Who gainsay this, are frantic, I maintain,</L>
<L>Nor merit Hymen nor the silken chain,</L>
<L>And when indecent and immodest, sure</L>
<L>Deserve a gibbet, or a lock secure.—</L>
<L>See the fair charmers blushing as they read,</L>
<L>See virtue start, and decency recede,</L>
<L>Then own your heart of unrelenting stuff;</L>
<L>Or, say you've read too little,—wrote enough.</L>
<L>Oh sex, held sacred by the good and brave,</L>
<L>Which to the world the promis'd saviour gave!</L>
<L>Let love await thee, and let virtue prove</L>
<L>How much you merit, and how much we love;</L>
<L>Let saints salute thee with a song divine,</L>
<L>Fruition meet for souls attun'd as thine;</L>
<L>But why this flight?—kind heav'n avert the stroke,</L>
<L>Nor let religion droop at * * * 's joke,</L>
<L>Tho' back'd by heathen Gods, or hell, he dare</L>
<L>To treat Redemption as a strange affair.—</L>
<L>Burke, Hewitt, Henley, Gwatkin, I esteem,</L>
<L>Their virtues, * * *, are far above thy theme.</L>
<L>Should Cam, with spreading laurels on his head,</L>
<L>Like thee e'er write, or thee attempt to read,</L>
<L>To Tartarus the rev'rend chief should go,</L>
<L>Drink deep of Lethe, and forget below,</L>
<L>Of Helicon the sweet inspiring taste,</L>
<L>Which oft has charm'd us in his verses past;</L>
<L>He then might mount thy courser's back, and drop</L>
<L>A sprig of birch, triumphant, on the top</L>
<L>Of some rich dunghill, where thy muse oft strays</L>
<L>To cull a simile, or gather bays.—</L>
<L>Cervantes little thought his heroe's horse,</L>
<L>Would be the subject of a limping verse;</L>
<L><PB N="202" REF="034158_0179_0FFC8645476D94B0"/>Nor could the Don, whose honest nature knew</L>
<L>To virtue's laws the sacred rev'rence due,</L>
<L>Whose friendly bosom beat the pulse of love</L>
<L>To all who in this giddy circle move,</L>
<L>E'er dream, tho' mad with tales of chivalry,</L>
<L>That Rozinante would a pack-horse be</L>
<L>To such a dirty bastard muse; but hold</L>
<L>This faithful quadruped, tho' blind and old,</L>
<L>By instinct knew an ethic from a whore,</L>
<L>And threw her sprawling, where she'll rise no more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But stop, my muse, in travestying we're crost,</L>
<L>For here the sense, in Labyrinth, is lost,</L>
<L>The gaudy fly, that now sweet nectar sips,</L>
<L>From Nancy's cheek, or slumb'ring Chloe's lips,</L>
<L>Now flirts, in ecstacy, the candle round;</L>
<L>Now drops in toddy, and is quickly drown'd,</L>
<L>Pardon the simile, (I hate abuse,)</L>
<L>Is but an emblem of thy flirting muse.</L>
<L>Thy list of worthies, worthy we admit,</L>
<L>And wish them social, as we grant them wit.—</L>
<L>The hapless slave who toils, from day to day,</L>
<L>And heedless slumbers half his time away,</L>
<L>Is not an object to deserve a hiss—</L>
<L>But he who strives to write, and writes amiss.—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thy list of heroes (save the infernal chief</L>
<L>Whose curse eternal, staggers thy belief)</L>
<L>Wise heroes all, but * * *, I think 'twas wrong</L>
<L>T' insert their names in such a silly song,—</L>
<L>But honest nature (conscious as I am</L>
<L>There's none so blind, in reason none so lame,</L>

<HEAD>☞ A NOTE BY THE PUBLISHER.</HEAD>
<P>The poem to which the above was written, as an answer, has, I believe, been long since forgotten; and as the author was acknowledged to be a very worthy and respectable man, though a very bad poet, his shame should be forgotten also. The satire is therefore published without the name of the author, and thus it is hoped, some instruction to other writers, and some diversion to the reader my be gathered from it, without injuring the feel∣ings of any person whatever. Those who have read the work alluded to, (which the reader will observe, was printed many years ago with no name annexed,) will judge for themselves, whether its sentence here pronounced, was just or not; and those who never have, and probably never will, may consider the answer as a description of bad poetry in general, in which light it is now given to the world, and may be serviceable in restraining those who scribble prophanely or indecently, without the skill to compose verse, or sense to entertain their readers.</P>

<HEAD>COLIN and CELIA: A PASTORAL POEM.</HEAD>
<L>WHERE slumb'ring streams in liquid silence flow,</L>
<L>And fragrant beauties on their borders grow;</L>
<L>Where smiling nature greets th' approach of spring,</L>
<L>And warbling songsters soothing sonnets sing;</L>
<L>Where gentle gales their fanning wings display,</L>
<L>And whisper pleasures as they steal away;—</L>
<L>There Colin wand'ring, lost in dreams of love,</L>
<L>Saw Celia's form in clouded beauty move;</L>
<L>He heard her words in trembling accents break,</L>
<L>Then step'd aside, to listen, as she spake.</L>
<L>He vow'd to love, with sweet submission swore,</L>
<L>But hapless Celia ne'er may view him o'er.</L>
<L>Her moving words the balmy breezes bear,</L>
<L>And gently waft them to the shepherd's ear.</L>
<L>Each soothing sound his deep attention caught,</L>
<L>But Celia's name enraptur'd ev'ry thought—</L>
<L>When smoothly gliding thro' the silent grove,</L>
<L>She saw her Colin melting into love,</L>
<L>"<HI>His soul thus utt'rance gave.</HI>"</L>
<BIBL>MILTON.</BIBL>
<L>Why dubious, Celia, of thy Colin's love,</L>
<L>And why lamenting to the silent grove?</L>
<L>In early youth your pleasing chains I bore,</L>
<L>And captive still, my lovely maid, adore.</L>
<L>Should Venus, circled in an orb of charms,</L>
<L>With sweet submission court me to her arms,</L>
<L>Her all-divine would ineffectual prove,</L>
<L>Nor cou'd her beauty make me change my love.</L>
<L>"<HI>She blush'd and smil'd.</HI>"</L>
<BIBL>MILTON.</BIBL>
<L>Then Colin's eyes with sparkling pleasure roll,</L>
<L>A torrent rapture rushing to his soul.</L>
<L>He smiling springs, in transport, views her charms,</L>
<L>And clasps her gently yielding in his arms.</L>

<L>Methought I walk'd in Eden's grove,</L>
<L>The air was soft and mild,</L>

<L>The cooing dove was Celia's voice,</L>
<L>The angel Celia prov'd;</L>
<L>Her plaints that mask the pleasing noise,</L>
<L>Her form angelic mov'd.</L>
<L>The weeping cloud with tempest full,</L>
