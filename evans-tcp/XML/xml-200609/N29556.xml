<HEAD>HIS EXCELLENCY'S SPEECH, TO THE HONOURABLE THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY <HI>MARYLAND,</HI>
<DATE><HI>April</HI> the 26<HI>th. Anno Domini</HI> 1700.</DATE></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have now had a Year and an half's Experience of me, which I hope will Confirm you in the Truth of what I have publickly assured you of, my best En∣deavours for your Service, which I promise I will allways justly perform.</P>
<P>I cannot but acknowledge that all your Actions in our last meeting gave me great satisfaction, for it was managed with that Accord and good agreement, that there was not the least shadow or Colour for any ill disposed People to make any malitious remarks upon: And that good Understanding which we were so happy at first to Create, will I hope be mutually preserved on both sides; as it is my fixed Resolution it shall be inviolably on mine. After which I will give you all the convincing Proofs of what I have solemnly averred, in my Regards for the Province in General, and every one of you in Particular. Wherefore if you labour under any difficulties, I am ready to redress them and assure you I will suppress all unnecessary charges and expences to make you easy, And have the Vanity to believe your Examination of the publick Accounts will convince you of what I have already done in that, not having since the last ASSEMBLY, which is Ten Months ago, Entailed Ten Pounds Charge upon you, or any individual Person in the Province: But on the contrary, Averted what lay in my Power.</P>
<P><HI>GENTLEMEN,</HI></P>
<P>SINCE it is and ought to be the Great End of all GENERAL ASSEMBLY'S, to consult the Honour of GOD and the Service of their King and Countrey, the Ignominious Report which is handed about by some, leads me to acquaint you of an Order of his Most Sacred MAJESTY in Council, for the disanulling the Law which is Entituled the <HI>Act for Establish∣ing the Protestant Religion.</HI> The Repealing the said Law, gives no Room to any Person to suggest it's being disassented to, upon any other grounds then it mentions; you having clog∣ged and loaded it with things of different Natures, which I hope you will wisely Correct with∣out the least Hesitation. For we are happy under the Wings and Protection of a Prince whose Delight is to run the greatest Hazards for the Conservation of our Property's, and never yet obstructed his People in pursuing that Blessed Name of Liberty.</P>
<P>YOU are sensible how useful Religion is in the good Government of a Nation or Province. It's the uniting the People, the keeping Men good, and deterring them from committing of Rapines of all degrees, upon each other. Much may be said upon this Subject, which is not so proper here, and not being my Tallent, neither is it necessary, where I am morally assured those Persons to whom I apply, are so well inclined, and are so good Judges of the Fatal Con∣sequences would attend us in the Loss of that good Law.</P>
<P><HI>GENTLEMEN,</HI></P>
<P>I shall not here enumerate what other affairs we are to concert this Sessions of Assembly, but will leave you to proceed in the usual way of Conference and Message, being ready to joyn with you wherein we may promote his Majesty's Service, on which depends the Good of this Province.</P>

<HEAD>THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY'S ANSWER TO HIS EXCELLENCY'S SPEECH</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE have observed the Progress of your EXCELLENCY'S Government, and grate∣fully acknowledge your sincere endeavours for the good of his MAJESTY's Leige People in this Province; And without any jealousies assure our selves the same for the future</P>
<P>WE are extreamly satisfied to have your Excellency acknowledge our Actions in the last Sessions to have been to your satisfaction. We assure your Excellency we are come again with the same Candid and Honest Resolution, inviolably to maintain the same good agreement, and right understanding, which hath hitherto been betwixt us; And confess have had convin∣cing proofs of your Excellency's reguard for the Province in general, and every one of us in particular.</P>
<P>WE thankfully acknowledge your Excellency hath managed the affairs of this Province with the least charge, and expence that could be. Your Government hath been disce<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, just, easy, and most acceptable to us all; and if any difficulties come upon this Province and us, we will never seditiously, factiously, nor with anger and reflections secretly murmur and grumble, But with upright and honest hearts, according to our duty, with Candour and Freedom in proper place, will represent such grievances to your Excellency, being intirely confident of your Excellency's Redress, and in the mean time we have no apprehension that any difficulty will be to us by your Excellency's procurement.</P>
<P>THE Glory of GOD. And the Advancement of this his Majesty's Province, and good Correspondency with our neighbouring Colonys shall be our endeavours. And if his Majesty hath been pleased to Repeal the present Act for establi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hing the Protestant Religion, yet will we not be discouraged, but endeavour by your Excellency's Conduct, to adju<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t matters so a∣greeable to his Majesties Pleasure, and the general satisfaction of this Province; that we hope his Majesty, will <HI>at length by Law establish Religion amongst us according to the Church of England</HI>; that our Children and Posterity being preserved in the unity of the Church, from Faction and Schism in Honesty and Charity, may become good and sober Men loving Virtue, flying Vice, the rational consequence of true Christian Doctrine, which God preserve amongst us. We never had the least apprehension of his Majesties obstructing our Liberty, and we have a sufficient assurance of his Royal Atchievements for the preservation of it. If it be at any time unjustly obstructed, we are assured that such obstruction proceeds not from his Majesty, the whole course of whose Government proclaims his Goodess to his Subjects; neither have we any fear of your Excellencies perverting his Majesties Instructions. We acknowledge you have well represented his Majesties Clemency, and discreetly managed the Prerogative, &amp; are truly sensible <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our own happiness under your Excellencies Government, of which we heartily wish the continuance.</P>
<P>ABOUT the a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fairs that may happen to be considered of this Sessions, since your Excel∣lency leaves it to us, we shall be willing to proceed in the usual ways of Conference and Mes∣sage, and desire to decline all strife and contention without any jealousie or suspition, with one heart to promote his Majesties Service, from which the true Interest of this Province can not be seperate.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU having not onely ingeniously, but so candidly exprest yourselves in an∣swer to what his Excellency was yesterday pleased to say to you, (which is here very kindly received) this Board cannot have any apprehensions, but that you will chear∣fully exert your utmost endeavours this Session, to approve your selves worthy of the honor and happiness you have to profess your selves good Christians, and his Majesties faithful Subjects; and therein first to consult the Honour and Glory of GOD.</P>
<P>Whereupon his Excellency is pleased to recommend to your consideration, his most Sacred Majesties Order in Council herewith sent you, and that you would apply your selves to con∣cert such rules and measures, as may best establish, and secure to you, and your posterities, your Religion, (which at present by the said order seems to be altogether unhinged) and make such reasonable Laws therefore, as may not meet the least objection in passing his Ma∣jesties Royal Assent.</P>
