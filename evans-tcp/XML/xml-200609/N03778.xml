<P><HI>Tuesday, June</HI> 5. Went in the Morning to <HI>Blendon,</HI> five Miles from <HI>Blackheath,</HI> and enjoy'd a sweet Retreat at the House of Mr. <HI>Delamot.</HI>—Preached with unusual Power at <HI>Bexley Common,</HI> at 11 in the Morning, to about 300 People, and in the Evening, near <HI>Woolwich,</HI> to several Thousands—My Word, I believe, came with the Demonstration of the Spirit. I return'd to <HI>Blendon</HI> rejoicing, and spent the Evening most delightfully with many dear Christian Friends, who came from <HI>London</HI> to see me. <HI>Oh! how does their sweet Company cause me to long for Communion amongst the Spirits of just Men made perfect!

<P><HI>Wednesday, June</HI> 6. Breakfasted with many Friends, and gave a Word of Exhortation to many more that came from <HI>London</HI> to bid me adieu.—Their Hearts were ready to break with Sorrow.—But GOD, I hope, will supply my Absence, by raising up more Ministers to go in and out before them. About 10 in the Morn∣ing, read Prayers and preached at <HI>Bexley</HI> Church,

<P><HI>Thursday, June</HI> 7. Received two Letters from Persons confessing, that they came to hear me out of a bad Motive, but were apprehended by the free Grace of JESUS CHRIST.—Answer∣ed them, and some others.—Read Prayers, and preached in the same Church as I did last Night.—Took some Refreshment, and returned in the Evening, and preached at <HI>Bexley</HI> Church, being much excited so to do, by the kind Sollicitations of Mr. <HI>Peers.</HI>—The Congregation was much larger than we could expect, and most, I believe, were much affected.—Here some of Mr. <HI>Delamot'</HI>s Family gave us the Meeting.—After Sermon I return'd to their House at <HI>Blendon,</HI> praising and blessing GOD, that we had once more an Oppor∣tunity of building up each other in our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>

<P><HI>Friday, June</HI> 8, Preached at <HI>Bexley</HI> in the Morning, and at <HI>Charleton</HI> in the Afternoon, whither I was invited by the Earl and Countess of <HI>Egmont.</HI> Both before and after Sermon they entertained me with the utmost Civility.—My Heart was much comforted by GOD, and at Night I returned with my Friends to my sweet Retreat at <HI>Blendon, Oh! the Comforts of having all of one Mind in a House!

<P><HI>Sunday, June</HI> 10. Hasten'd back to <HI>Blendon,</HI> where more of our Brethren came last Night to see me.—Preached with more Power than ever and assisted in administring the Sacrament to a∣bout 200 Communicants in <HI>Bexley</HI> Church.—Din'd, gave Thanks, and sung Hymns at Mr. <HI>Delamot'</HI>s.—Preached with great Power in the Evening on <HI>Blackheath,</HI> to above 20000 People, and collected sixteen Pounds seven Seven Shillings for the Orphans. After Sermon I went to the <HI>Green Man,</HI> near the Place where I preached, and continued till Midnight instant in Prayer, Praise and Thanksgiving, and Christian Con∣versation.—I believe there were near 50 or 60 of us in all.—Great Decency and much Devotion was to be seen.—Numbers stood by as Spectators. GOD e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rged my Heart much in Prayer and Exhortation. And in short, every Thing was so well regulated, that all unprejudiced Persons that came in must say, <HI>Surely GOD is in this Place.</HI></P>
<P>Many of them watched unto Prayer and Praise all Night. I think it every Christian's Duty to be particularly careful to honour and glorify GOD in Places where he is most disho∣nour'd. Some can sing the Songs of the Drun∣kard in Publick Houses; Others can spend whole Nights in Chambering and Wantonness, why should Christian be ashamed to sing the Songs of the Lamb, and spend Nights, as their LORD did before them, in Exercises of De∣votion?</P>

<P><HI>Wednesday, June</HI> 20. Set out about five in the Morning, and hasted to <HI>Broad-oaks,</HI> about 20 Miles from <HI>Hertford.</HI> About Midway at <HI>Bishop-St<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rford,</HI> as we were passing through, a Person entirely unknown, constrained both me and my Friends to come and refresh ourselves a little at his House.—We accepted of his Offer, and found he was Son to a Gentleman, who had sent to engage me to preach at this Place on <HI>Friday</HI> Night next.—Having spent an Hour very agreeably with some Christian Friends, he went with us, and brought us on our Way to <HI>Broad-oaks,</HI> the Way being intricate. About 12 we got thither, and perceived that Providence had sent us most opportunely to a Family, some of whom being born after the Spirit, are, for that Reason, most violently opposed and persecuted
<PB N="15" REF="004633_0007_100DB26CCC3C6688"/>
by those Foes of their own Houshold, who are only born after the Flesh. A Clergyman has been employed to divert them from their present Madness, as they call it; and has done them the Honour of Preaching against them.—For this Week past, they have been continually beset with Numbers of such, who are Lovers of Plea∣sure more than Lovers of GOD, and who would tell them, that a decent, genteel and fashionable Religion, is sufficient to carry them to Heaven. They knew nothing of my paying them this Visit, which made them more thankful.—No one can tell what a comfortable Meeting GOD gave us.—Surely it was Heaven begun upon Earth.—We found the Sweets of Opposition, and rejoiced greatly in the Prospect of suffering for CHRIST's Sake. To encrease our Satisfaction Mr. <HI>Delamot,</HI> a Convert of Mr. <HI>Ingham'</HI>s, came from <HI>Cambridge</HI> to meet us.—He is scandalously opposed at that University.—The Students make him a Proverb of Reproach, and abuse him in the rudest Manner.—He has been forbid coming in to one College, and two or three that associate with him have been threatned much by their Tutors for keeping him Company. And here I cannot but remark what wonderful Mercies GOD has shewn this Mr. <HI>Delamot'</HI>s Family.—About three or four Years ago, GOD was plea∣sed to touch the Heart of his Brother <HI>Charles,</HI> who hearing that Mr. <HI>Wesley</HI> was going to <HI>Georgia</HI> (tho' his Father would have settled him in a very handsome Way) offered to go Abroad with him as a Servant.—His Parents Consent
<PB N="16" REF="004633_0008_100DB270016DD458"/>
was asked, but they, and almost all their Rela∣tions, opposed it strenuously. However, the young Man being resolute, and convinced that GOD called him, at length they somewhat consented. He went abroad, lived with Mr. <HI>Wesley,</HI> served under him as a Son in the Gospel, did much good, and endured great Hardships for the Sake of JESUS CHRIST. Behold, how GOD rewarded him for leaving all. Whilst he was absent, GOD was pleased to make Use of the Ministry of Mr. <HI>Ingham,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Charles Wesley,</HI> in converting his Mother, two Sisters, and this young Gentlemen before-mentioned at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> who, I pray GOD, may stand as a Barrier against the Prophaneness, Debauchery, Lukewarmness and Deism of that Seat of Learn∣ing, and prove both a <HI>Barnabas</HI> and <HI>Boanerges</HI> in the Church of <HI>England!</HI> But to return,—After having spent some comfortable Hours to∣gether, we went to <HI>Wimbish Green,</HI> where Mr. <HI>Charles Wesley</HI> had preached some Time ago. I rode thither in a Chaise, and preached from it to about 400 People, with great Freedom and Power.

If we have done any Thing worthy the Censures of the Church, why do not the Right Reverend the Bishops call us to a publick Account? If not, why do they not confess and own us? It is well we can appeal to the great Bishop of Souls. They say, it is not regular our going out into the Highways and Hedges, and compelling poor Sinners to come in. We ought not <HI>so</HI> to beseech them to be reconciled to GOD. They desire to know by what Authority we preach; and ask, what Sign shewest thou that thou dost these Things? But, alas! what further Sign would they require? We went not into the Fields till we were excluded the Churches: And has not GOD set his Seal to our Ministry in an extra∣ordinary Manner? Have not many that were spiritually Blind received their Sight? Many that have been Lame strengthened to run the Way of GOD's Commandments? Have not the Deaf heard? The Lepers been cleansed? The Dead raised? And the Poor had the Gospel preached unto them? That these notable Mira∣cles have been wrought, not in our own Names, or by our own Power, but in the Name and by the Power of JESUS of <HI>Nazareth,</HI> cannot be denied.

<HEAD>The ANSWER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My</HI> LORD</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Thank your Lordship, for your Lordship's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> kind Letter.—My frequent Removes from Place to Place prevented my answering it sooner.—I am greatly obliged to your Lord∣ship, in that you are pleased to watch over my Soul, and to caution me against acting contrary to the Commission given me at Ordination.—But if the Commission we then receive, obliges us to preach no where but in that Parish which is committed to our Care, then all Persons act contrary to their Commission when they preach occasionally in any strange Place. And con∣sequently your Lordship equally offends when you preach out of your own Diocese. As for inveighing against the Clergy (without a Cause) I deny the Charge. What I say I am ready to make good when ever your Lordship pleases. Let those that bring Reports to your Lordship about my Preaching, be brought Face to Face, I am ready to give them an Answer. St. <HI>Paul</HI> exhorts <HI>Timothy, not to receive an Ac∣cusation against an Elder under two or three Witnesses.</HI> And even <HI>Nicodemus</HI> could say, <HI>the Law suffered no Man to be condemned un∣heard.</HI> I shall only add, that I hope your Lordship will inspect into the Lives of your other Clergy, and censure them for being <HI>Over-remiss,</HI> as much as you censure me for
<PB N="31" REF="004633_0015_100DB27F9B8C3B18"/>
being <HI>Over-righteous:</HI> It is their falling from their Articles, and not preaching the Truth as it is in JESUS, that has excited the present Zeal of (whom they in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ision call) <HI>the Methodist Preachers.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bing</HI>'s Sermon (for which I thank your Lordship) confirms me more and more in my Opinion, that I ought to be instant in Season, and out of Sea∣son. For to me, he seems to know no more of the true Nature of Regeneration, than <HI>Nicodemus</HI> did, when he came to JESUS by Night.—Your Lordship may observe, that he does not speak a Word of Original Sin, or the dreadful Consequences of our Fall in <HI>Adam,</HI> upon which the Doctrine of the New-Birth is entirely founded. No; like other polite Preachers, he seems to think, in the very Be∣ginning of his Discourse, that St. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aul'</HI>s Description of the Wickedness of the Heathen is only to be referred to them of past Ages: whereas I affirm, we are all included as much under the Guilt and Consequences of Sin as they were, and if any Man preach any other Doctrine, she shall bear his Punishment who∣soever he be. Again, <HI>my Lord,</HI> the Doctor entirely mistakes us when we talk of the <HI>sensible</HI> Operations of the Holy Ghost. He understands as just as those carnal <HI>Jews</HI> un∣derstood JESUS CHRIST, who, when our LORD talked of giving them that Bread which came down from Heaven, said, <HI>How can this Man give us his Fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh to eat?</HI> Indeed I know not that we do use the Word <HI>sensible,</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="004633_0016_100DB28398A422D0"/>
when we are talking of the Operations of the Spirit of GOD: But if we do, we do not mean, that GOD's Spirit does manifest itself to our <HI>Senses,</HI> but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it may be perceived by the Soul, as rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is any sensible Impression made upon the Body. But to disprove this, the Doctor brings our LORD's Allusion to the Wind in the third of St. <HI>John,</HI> which is one of the best Texts he could urge to prove it. For if the Analogy of our LORD's Dis∣course be carried on, we shall find it amounts to thus much; That altho' the Operations of the Spirit of GOD can no more be accounted for, than how the Wind cometh and whither it goeth; yet may they be as easily felt by the Soul as the Wind may be felt by the Body.—My Lord, indeed we speak what we know. But, says the Doctor, "These Men have no Proof to offer for their <HI>inward</HI> Manifestations." What Proof, my Lord, does the Doctor re∣quire; would he have us raise dead Bodies? Have we not done greater Things than these? I speak with all Humility, has not GOD by our Ministry raised many dead Souls to a spi∣ritual Life. Verily, if Men will not believe the Evidence GOD has given that he sent us, neither would they believe tho' one rose from the Dead. Besides, my Lord, the Doctor Charges us with Things we are entire Strangers to, such as the denying Men the Use of GOD's Creatures; Encouraging Abstinence, Prayer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to the Neglect of the Duties of our Sta∣tions. Lord lay not this Sin to his Charge.

Again, he says, I suppose Mr. <HI>Benjamin Seward</HI> to be a Person <HI>believing in</HI> CHRIST, <HI>and blameless in his Conversation,</HI> before what I call his Conversion. But this is a direct Untruth. For it was thro' the Want of a <HI>living Faith</HI> in JESUS CHRIST, which he now has, that he was not a Christian before, but a a meer Moralist. Your Lordship knows that our Article says, Works done without the Spirit of GOD, and true Faith in JESUS CHRIST have the Nature of Sin. And such were all the Works done by Mr. <HI>Benjamin Seward</HI> before the Time mentioned in my Journal. Again, my Lord, the Doctor repre∣sents That as my Opinion concerning Quakers▪ in general, which I only meant of those I con∣versed with in particular. But the Doctor, and the rest of my Reverend Brethren, are welcome to judge me as they please. <HI>Yet a little while, and we shall all appear before the great Shepherd of our Souls.</HI> There, there, my Lord, shall it be determined, who are true Ministers, and who are Wolves in Sheep's Cloathing. Our LORD, I believe, will not be ashamed to <HI>confess us pub∣lickly in that Day.</HI> I pray GOD we all may approve ourselves such faithful Ministers of the <HI>New Testament,</HI> that we may be able to lift up our Heads with Boldness. As for declining the Work in which I am engaged, my Blood runs chill▪ at the very Thoughts of it. I am as much convinced it is my Duty to act as I do, as that the Sun shines at Noon-Day. I can foresee the Consequences very well. They

have already in one Sense thrust us out of the Synagogues. By and by they will think it is doing GOD Service to kill us. But, my Lord, if you and the rest of the Bishops cast us out, our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and common Master will take us up. Tho' all Men should deny us, yet will not he. And however you may censure us as evil Doers, and Disturbers of the Peace, yet if we do suffer for our present Way of act∣ing, your Lordship at the Great Day will find, that we suffer only for <HI>Righteousness Sake.</HI> In Patience therefore do I possess my Soul.

<P><HI>Tuesday, July</HI> 10. Preached Yesterday E∣vening at the <HI>Brick-Yard</HI> to about 8000 People. Dined to-day with my honoured Fellow-Labou∣rer, Mr. <HI>Wesley,</HI> and many other Friends, at <HI>Two-Mill-Hill</HI> in <HI>Kingswood,</HI> and preached after∣wards to several Thousand People, and Colliers, in the School-House, which has been carried on so successfully, that the Roof is ready to be put up. The Design I think is good. Old as well as young are to be instructed. A great and a visible Alteration is made in the Behaviour of the Colliers. Instead of Cursing and Swearing,
<PB N="35" REF="004633_0017_100DB28596603DB0"/>
they are heard to sing Hymns about the Woods; and the rising Generation, I hope, will be a Generation of Christians. They seem much affected by the Word. They melt into Tears, and are observed to attend the Churches and So∣cieties when Mr. <HI>Wesley</HI> is absent from them. The Prospect of their future Welfare filled me with Joy unspeakable. They took a most affec∣tionate Leave of me. LORD <HI>put thou their Tears into thy Bottle!</HI></P>
<P>Went immediately after Sermon was ended with Mr. <HI>Wesley,</HI> and several other Friends, to <HI>Bath,</HI> and preached there to about 3000 People at 7 in the Evening. It rained a little all the while, but the People were very patient and at∣tentive, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ever had such Power given me to speak to the polite Scoffers before. <HI>Oh! that the Scales were removed from the Eyes of their Minds!</HI></P>
<P>Heard to Day the Town Clerk of <HI>Bristol</HI> did my Brother <HI>Wesley</HI> and me the Honour, to desire the Grand-Jury, at their Quarter-Sessions, to present our Meetings, and to have the Riot-Act read, but they did not regard him. Nay one, that was called to serve on the Petty-Jury, offered to submit to any Fine, rather than do any thing against us; who, he said, were true Servants of JESUS CHRIST. <HI>May he meet with that Re∣ward which our LORD has promised to all th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se that shall confess him before Men! The Hour of Persecution is not yet come. These are som<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> distant Proofs of it, I really wonder it comes on no faster.

<P><HI>Wednesday, July</HI> 11. Preached at 11 in the Morning, to a larger Audience than last Night, and almost with equal Power. Hasten∣ed to <HI>Bristol,</HI> and preached in the Evening at <HI>Baptist-Mills</HI> to a large Congregation. It rained much: <HI>But, blessed be GOD, the People's Hearts are so far influenced by the Gospel of</HI> CHRIST, <HI>that they care but little whether it rains or shines.</HI></P>
<P>After this, my Brother <HI>Wesley</HI> and I went to the Women and Men's Societies, settled some Affairs, and united the two leading Societies to∣gether. A great Harmony and Sweetness of Soul was amongst us all. My Heart was full of Love for them, and they wept most sorely at my Farewel-Exhortation and Prayer. <HI>How can I be thankful enough to GOD, for sending me hither to see, that the Seed has been sown on good Ground; and that by the Ministry of Mr.</HI> Wesley <HI>it has received great Increase. May it still increase with all the Increase of GOD.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thursday, July</HI> 12. Was busied most of the Day in sitting a Sermon for the Press <HI>On the Indwelling of the Spirit,</HI> which I would recom∣mend to all. Preached in the Evening to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or 9000 People in the <HI>Bowling-Green,</HI> with great Freedom and Power, and afterwards spent an Hour most delightfully with some Christian Friends. <HI>Blessed be GOD for the Communion of Saints!

<P><HI>Friday, July</HI> 13. Preached my Farewel Ser∣mon at 7 in the Morning to a weeping and deep∣ly affected Audience. My Heart was full, and I continued near two Hours in Prayer and Preaching. The poor People shed many Tears, and sent up Thousands of Prayers in my Behalf, and would scarce let me go away. Their Mites they most chearfully contributed to the School-House at <HI>Kingswood,</HI> and proved, I think, to a Demonstration, that they had not received the Word of GOD in vain. <HI>Blessed be GOD for seeing this Increase of his Mercy. Blessed be GOD for my coming hither to behold some Fruits of my Labours.</HI> Many Souls have been strengthened and comforted, many convinced of Sin, and myself also more established and strong in the LORD. <HI>As Oppositions abound, so do my Conso∣lations much more abound! Who is so good a Master as</HI> JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>Retired after Sermon to vent my Heart, which was ready to burst with a Sense of GOD's espe∣cial, distinguishing, repeated Mercies. Dined with and took a most affectionate Leave of a whole Roomful of weeping Friends. Set out about 4 o'Clock, and reached <HI>Thornbury</HI> about 8 in the Evening. It raining exceeding hard most part of the Day, there were but few Country People.—However, I preached to about 600 from a Table in the Street. <HI>I hope GOD gave it his Blessing.</HI></P>

Breakfasted at a Quaker's, and reached <HI>Gloucester</HI> with my honoured Friend, Mr. <HI>John Wesley,</HI> and some others, by 3 in the Afternoon. Went to the Cathedral Prayers, dined, and afterwards preached to a Congregation a third Part larger than I have had in this Place before. <HI>Blessed be GOD, wherever I go, I find my Audiences are always more numerous by far at the last than at the first.—LORD make me truly humble and thankful.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, July</HI> 15.

<P><HI>Monday, July</HI> 16. Lay last Night at the House of Mr. <HI>E- s</HI> of <HI>Ebly,</HI> and had a most comfortable Time of it. Went to <HI>Tedbury,</HI> about six Miles from thence, having been earnest∣ly invited several Times and preached at Noon to about 4000 People.—Many gracious Souls of divers Denominations came to meet me, with whom I took sweet Counsel.—The Scoffers, be∣fore I came, had threatned to do something.—But the Power of GOD's Word overcame them. Visited in the Afternoon, Mr. <HI>O</HI>—, a Baptist Teacher, and went afterwards, in Company with several Friends, to <HI>Malmsbury</HI> in <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> about 3 Miles from <HI>Tedbury,</HI> whither I had been invited by a Letter signed by 52 Persons. At 7 I preached to about 3000 People, who, I be∣lieve, felt the Power of GOD's Word. Much Opposition had been made by the <HI>Pharisees</HI> against my coming; and the Minister in parti∣cular had wrote to the Church-warden to stop me; but he was more noble. Numbers, as I heard afterwards, who were vastly prejudiced against me by lying Reports, went away convinced that I spoke the Words of Truth and Soberness. <HI>Thou shalt answer for me, O LORD my GOD.</HI></P>

gladly received us for our Master's Sake. I had a Thorn in the Flesh sent to buffet me, was weak in Body, deserted in Mind, and felt my∣self to be what I often say we all are by Nature, half a Devil, and half a Beast. With great inward Reluctance I rose and preached to about 2000 Souls at 8 in the Morning, then I retired to my Bed again, with an unspeakable Pressure upon my Heart till Noon. Was something better after Dinner, and much reviv'd to see what an effectual Door was like to be opened in <HI>Wiltshire</HI> for Preaching the Gospel. Went and paid my Respects to the chief Magistrate, who was my Friend, and reached <HI>Cirencester</HI> about six in the Evening.</P>
<P>Here also Men breathed out Threatnings against me, but were not impowered to put them in Execution. Numbers came from Neighbour∣ing Towns. My Congregation was as large again as when I preached here last. GOD enabled me, weak as I was, to speak boldly, as I ought to speak. Every Thing was carried on with Decency and Order, and my inward Com∣forts began to return again. <HI>GOD will not always be chiding, neither keepeth He his Anger for ever.

He answered, <HI>It was an odd Way of preaching.—But, Sir,</HI> says he, <HI>I must go away to a Fair; before you came I had wrote you another Letter, which I will send you yet, if you please.</HI> Upon this I thanked him, paid him the Respect due to a Magistrate, and took my Leave.

<P>I apprehend your Meetings to be unlawful, having no Toleration to protect you in it.

<P>As for the other Assembly you are pleased to mention, 'tis contrary to my Will, having never given my Consent to it, nor approved of it, but discouraged it before your Reverendship came to this Town; and if these Cudgellers persist in it, I shall set them upon the same Level with you, and think you all Breakers of the public Peace. You very well know there are Penal-Laws against Cursing and Swearing, and I could wish there were the same against Deceit and Hypocrisy. Your appearing against me as a swift Witness at the Day of Judgment, I must own, is a most terrible Thing, and may serve as a Bug-bear for Children, or People of weak Minds; but believe me, Reverend Sir, those Disguises will have but little Weight amongst Men of common Understanding.</P>

<P>About 8 o'Clock I went into a Field, lent me by Mr. <HI>H—n;</HI> and tho' one said, I should not go alive out of <HI>Basing stoke</HI> if I preached there, and another said, the Drum should beat just by me, yet I had little or no Interruption, and GOD gave me such great Power in speaking against Revelling, and those few Scoffers that were there, that they were not able to gainsay, or resist it. As I came from the Field, passing through the Church-Yard, the Boys, headed by some of the ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er Sort, saluted me as before, called me strange Names, which, I trust, was received in the Spirit of our dear Master.</P>
<P>After this I pray'd and sung Psalms at the Inn with s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me few Disciples, and then took my
<PB N="48" REF="004633_0024_100DB2980972CED8"/>
Leave.—As I passed by on Horseback, I saw a Stage built for the Cudgellers and Wrestlers; and as I rode farther, I met divers coming to the Revel, which affected me so much, that I had no Rest in my Spirit. And therefore having asked Counsel of GOD, and perceiving an un∣usual Power and Warmth enter into my Soul, though I was gone above a Mile from the Town, I could not bear to see so many dear Souls for whom CHRIST died, ready to perish, and no Minister or Magistrate interpose. Upon this I told my dear Fellow Travellers that I was resol∣ved to follow the Example of <HI>Howel Harris</HI> in <HI>Wales,</HI> and to bear my Testimony against such lying Vanities, let the Consequences, as to my own private Person, be what they would. They immediately consenting, I rode back to the Town, got upon the Stage erected for the Wrest∣lers, and began to shew them the Error of their Ways.—Many seemed ready to hear what I had to say, but one more zealous for his Master than the rest, and fearing Conviction every Time I so much as attempted to speak, set the Boys upon repeating their Uzza's.—My Soul, I perceived, was in a sweet Frame, willing to be offered up, so that I might save some of those, to whom I was about to speak; but all in vain. While I was on the Stage, one struck me with his Cudgel, which I received with the utmost Love; till at last finding the Devil would not permit them to give me Audience, I got off, and after much thronging and pushing me, I mounted my Horse with unspeakable Satisfaction w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hin myself,

that I had now begun to attack the Devil in his strongest Holds, and had borne my Testimony against the detestable Diversions of this Genera∣tion.—Ye Masters of <HI>Israel,</HI> what are you do∣ing? Ye Magistrates, that are called Gods in Scripture, why sleep you? Why do you bear the Sword in vain? Why count you me a Troub∣ler of <HI>Israel;</HI> and why say you I teach People to be idle, when you can connive at, if not subscribe to such hellish Meetings as these, which not on∣ly draw People from their bodily Work, but directly tend to destroy their precious and im∣mortal Souls; surely I shall appear against you at the Judgment Seat of CHRIST; for these Diver∣sions keep People from true Christianity as much as Paganism itself. And I doubt not, but it will require as much Courage and▪ Power to di∣vert People from these Things, as the Apostles were obliged to exert in converting the Heathen from their dumb Idols. <HI>However, in the Strength of my Master, I will now enter the Lists, and begin an offensive War with Satan, and all his Host. If I perish, I perish; I shall have the Testimony of a good Conscience, I shall be free from the Blood of all Men.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Basingstoke</HI> I intended to go to <HI>Wind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or,</HI> but having not sent to any in that Place, and longing for a little Retirement, I lay at <HI>Stains,</HI> and spent some Hours in sweet Fellowship with my dear Fellow-Travellers. <HI>O what a blessed Thing it is for Brethren to dwell together in Unity!</HI></P>

This is the Sum and Substance of the Generality of our modern Doctrine. And therefore, was I to die immediately for speaking, yet I should

not die in Peace, unless I bore my Testimony a∣gainst them.

<P><HI>Monday, July</HI> 23. This Day I received the following Letter from the Quaker at <HI>Basingstoke,</HI> at whose House I lodged.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Basingstoke,</HI> <DATE><HI>July</HI> 21. 1739.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE><HI>My Dear</HI> FRIEND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>When I Yesterday went up to thy Inn, and found thee just gone, I was sorry that I miss'd an Opportunity, both of taking my Leave of thee, and expressing the Sense I had of the Power and Presence of GOD that was with thee, more especially in the latter Part of thy Sermon, and in thy Prayer after it; However, I am truly glad, that thou wert preserved out of the Hands of cruel and unreasonable Men. Thou heardst of the Threatnings of many, but the Malice and blind Zeal of some went fur∣ther. For hadst thou went to my Friend <HI>H—</HI> to Bed, or elsewhere towards that Part of the Town, which I believe was expected, there were 10 or 12 Men lying in wait to do thee a private Mischief, which I know by the Testi∣mony
<PB N="53" REF="004633_0026_100DB29B50F53790"/>
of one of those very Men, who boasted to me, <HI>We would have given him a secret Blow, and prevented his making Disturbances.</HI> This Confession <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> me out to me in the Warmth of his Zeal, as thinking, perhaps, that I could hate, at least, if not destroy (like him) all that were not of my own Party.</P>
<P>O thy noble Testimony against the Pro∣phaneness and Vanity of the Age. It re∣joiced me not a little. But when thou camest to the Necessity, the Nature and the Rewards of the <HI>New-Birth,</HI> the true Seed, thou wert carried beyond thyself, the Fountain of Life was opened, and flowed around amongst the Living. I am, for one, a Monument of free Grace and Mercy. <HI>O GOD how boundless it thy Love!</HI> He hath not hid his Mercies from me. I have often drank of the spiritual Rock, and been a Witness of the Joys of GOD's Salvation. Ay, those Joys, that sweet Presence of CHRIST, that carries Men above the Fear of the World, and enables them to overcome the World; that baptizeth into the Spirit and Nature of the SON OF GOD, and maketh Disciples indeed. It is a Sense of GOD ever near the Influences of his quickening Spirit, that is only able to deter from Evil, crucify the old Nature, create again to GOD, and perform his good and ac∣ceptable Will. This will make a thorough <HI>Reformation,</HI> beginning at the Heart, sanctify∣ing that, guarding of it, and malting it a holy Temple for the holy Spirit to dwell in, then producing holy Thoughts, Longings after di∣vine
<PB N="54" REF="004633_0027_100DB29D8A7575B0"/>
Enjoyments, Love, Joy, Solidity, Watch∣fulness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But, why this to thee? Thou hast drank deep of divine Love; only I know that the good Experiences of GOD's Children are often Causes of mutual Comfort. I have often been sensible of it myself, and therefore, not only thus privately, but publickly have I been strengthened to tell to others, that GOD is good, and that he has done great Things for my Soul. Ministers not thus qualified, and thus sent, may indeed be Ministers of those who sent them, but Ministers of CHRIST they cannot be.</P>
<P>May we, my dear Friend, tho' absent i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Body be present in Spirit, in him who is omni∣present. May we unitedly go on in the Cause of our common LORD and Master, to promote his Honour in winning Souls to him! May we bear a faithful and undaunted Testimony to him before all Men, in the midst of a perverse Generation! May we not flinch, but declare the Truth as it is in JESUS, not daubing, nor daring to make the Way to the Kingdom of GOD wider than it is. And may we finally be received up into the Mansions of Glory, there to live with all the righteous Generations, with those that have washed their Garments white in the Blood of the Lamb, and with those that have laid down their Lives for the Testimony of JESUS, and to sing with them, Hallelujahs, Glory and Praise, forever and ever! May the Antient of Days, the Alpha

</LETTER>
<P>My Friend, Mr. <HI>William Seward,</HI> received also a Letter from his Brother, in which were the following Paragraphs.</P>
<Q><P>I had a Letter <HI>per</HI> last Post from Mr.—wherein he speaks of one Mr.—of <HI>Corpus Christ College,</HI> whom his Uncle, a Clergy∣man, hath entirely discarded, and wrote to the College to expel him for his Methodistical Notions.</P>
<P>The old Clerk at <HI>Breferton,</HI> whom I before spoke of, having heard Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> at <HI>Bad∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y,</HI> was so affected, that he told me, he could have no rest in his Spirit; but after searching the <HI>Church-Homilies, Articles,</HI> &amp;c. and finding the Doctrine every way agreeable to them, he met with the Landlord of <HI>Contercup,</HI> who dis∣coursing about Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> told him he had some old Books that set forth the very same Doctrine. Soon after this he went to Work, being a Taylor by Trade, and asking for one of these Books, the others being lent out, he said he had not read above a Page or two, be∣fore the Truth broke in upon his Soul like Lightning. He said he could not go on with his Work with any Satisfaction, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣gers itched to be at his Book again, which the Man lent him home with him; a few <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> after, he got the other, which so strengthen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="56" REF="004633_0028_100DB29F242ABE48"/>
and confirmed him, that he could lay his Life down in Defence of the Truth as it is in JESUS. He says, the Gospel appears to him, as though he never read a Line in it before; and it is a greater Miracle to him, that he, an old Sinner, with one Foot in the Grave, should be called at these Years, than if he had seen the Dead raised. He always, by what I can learn, bore a fair Character, and was esteemed by his Neighbours, but now threatned with the Loss of his Bread, for coming to <HI>Badsey</HI> Society, and declaring his Testimony to the Truth of Mr. <HI>Whitefield'</HI>s Doctrine, or rather I should say, the Doctrine of the Gospel. The Books he met with are very oil, and, he says, were thrown by as waste Paper out of a Cler∣gyman's Library, that was sold after his Death, whereby the <HI>Contercup</HI> Man met with them, and they seemed very providentially reserved for his Use.</P></Q>
<P>Persons wonder at me, because I talk of Per∣secution, now the World is become Christian; but alas! was JESUS CHRIST to come down from Heaven at this Time, he would he treated as formerly. And whoever goes forth to preach the Gospel in his Spirit, must expect the same Treatment as his first Apostles met with. <HI>LORD, prepare us for all Events.</HI></P>
<P>Preached this Evening at <HI>Hackney-Marsh</HI> to about two thousand People.—I prayed and dis∣coursed for above two Hours, and with greater Demonstration of the Spirit than ever.—Floods of seemed
<PB N="57" REF="004633_0028_100DB29F242ABE48"/>
Tears were shed by the Hearers, and the Doctrine seemed to make its own Way into their Hearts. Every Day have I more and more Reason to rejoice in what GOD has done for my own, and others Souls. Thousands at the great Day will have Reason to bless GOD for Field-Preach∣ing. Then our Pharisees will believe. <HI>But LORD, grant the Veil may be taken from their Hearts, and the Scales from their Eyes, before that dreadful Day! For then Convictions will come too late.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tuesday, July</HI> 24. Dispatched my private Affairs, and preached in the Evening at <HI>Kenning∣ton-Common,</HI> to about 15000. The Doctrine, I believe, distilled like the Dew. <HI>May the Lord JESUS water their thirsty Souls!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wednesday, July</HI> 25. Preach'd this Evening at <HI>Edmonton,</HI> at the Desire of many. The Congregation was large and attentive, and I rejoiced in having an Opportunity of offering Salvation freely to the Rich. <HI>Oh, that all in high Stations were rich towards GOD!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thursday, July</HI> 26. Preached to upwards of ten Thousand at <HI>Hackney-Marsh,</HI> where I ap∣pointed purposely to preach, because there was to be an Horse-Race in the same Field. Blessed be GOD, I had the Pleasure of bearing my Te∣stimony against such unchristian Entertainments. Very few left the Sermon to see the Race, and some of those returned back again quickly, to whom I took Occasion of speaking with something of the Love and Simplicity of CHRIST, <HI>To him be all the Glory.</HI> I think this is a manifest Proof
<PB N="58" REF="004633_0029_100DB2A159FBAC20"/>
of the Success of our Doctrine. By the Help of GOD I will still go on to attack the Devil in his strongest Holds. The common People go to these Diversions for Want of knowing better. If we can once draw them from these, their Minds will be better prepared to receive the Gospel. <HI>Prosper, O LORD, this Work of my Hands upon me!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, July</HI> 27. Preached at <HI>Kennington-Common</HI> to my usual Number of Hearers; went to <HI>Lewisham,</HI> was kindly entertained by Mrs.—and lay at the House of Mr.—both which re∣ceived me and my Friends with Joy. <HI>Blessed be GOD for all his Mercies.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, July</HI> 28. Spent a comfortable Hour with my Friends in the Morning; went to pay a Visit to the Family of Justice <HI>Delamotte,</HI> at <HI>Blendon,</HI> where we exhorted and built up each other in the Knowledge and Fear of GOD. Preached at <HI>Blackheath</HI> in the Evening, and came home rejoicing that I saw great Fruits of my Ministry. The Bills which are sent to me, plainly prove, that GOD has worked on Num∣bers of Souls. <HI>At the Judgment Day you shall see, O Pharisees, what Good has been done by this Foolishness of Preaching. Many I believe, come to the Fields to worship the Father in Spirit and in Truth. GOD se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>keth such to worship him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, July</HI> 29. Preached this Morning in <HI>Moorfields</HI> to a much larger Congregation than we had last <HI>Sunday,</HI> and collected 24 <HI>l.</HI> 9 <HI>s.</HI> for the School at <HI>Kingswood.</HI> Received the Sacra∣ment at St. <HI>Paul'</HI>s, and preached at <HI>Kennington-Common</HI>
<PB N="59" REF="004633_0029_100DB2A159FBAC20"/>
in the Evening, where 20 <HI>l.</HI> was collec∣ted. GOD sent us a little Rain; but that only washed away the curious Hearers.—Near thirty Thousand stood their Ground, and GOD, I believe, watered them with the Dew of his heavenly Blessing. A more visible Alteration for the better is made in the People daily, a good Work is wrought in the Hearts of Numbers. It would be endless to recount how many come to me under strong Convictions of their lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Estate. <HI>GOD has begun, GOD will carry on the good Work in their Souls;—Even so, Lord</HI> JESUS!</P>
<P><HI>Monday, July</HI> 30. Was busied all the Morning in directing those to <HI>believe in</HI> JESUS CHRIST, who came asking me, <HI>What they should</HI> do <HI>to be saved?</HI> Preached at <HI>Plaistow,</HI> about 6 Miles from <HI>London,</HI> and an uncommon Power was in the Congregation.—My own Heart was much enlarged, and I returned home much rejoiced within myself that the Lord JESUS was pleased still to manifest himself more and more amongst us.</P>
<P><HI>Tuesday, July</HI> 31. Preached at <HI>Newington</HI> near <HI>Hackney,</HI> to about twenty thousand People, many of whose Hearts, as well as my own, were warmed under the Word. I preached upon <HI>Genesis</HI> iii. 15. and I hope the Seed of the Woman is now bruising the Serpent's Head to some Purpose. <HI>Amen, Lord JESUS, Amen!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wednesday, August</HI> 1. Preached this Evening at <HI>Mary Le Bone Fields,</HI> at the other End of the Town, to near thirty Thousand, and went after∣wards to take my Leave of <HI>Fetter-lane</HI> Society.
<PB N="60" REF="004633_0030_100DB2A315DF4DE0"/>
We parted in Love, and I hope the next Time we meet, we shall be in or at least nearer Heaven. <HI>Oh, that we may comfort one another with the Prospect of this Thing.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thursday, August</HI> 2. Preached at <HI>Newington</HI> to upwards of twenty Thousand People, and came home much rejoicing to see what a great Work GOD has done in this City. Thousands and I believe ten Thousands, come constantly to hear. Scoffers seem afraid to shew their Heads, being frequently overpowered by GOD's Word. I hope the Time is coming which the Prophet speaks of: <HI>Behold ye Despisers, and wonder, and perish; for I will work a Work in your Days, which you shall in no wise believe, though a Man declare it unto you.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, August</HI> 3. Spent the Day in compleat∣ing my Affairs, taking my Leave of my dear Friends, and preached in the Evening to near twenty Thousand at <HI>Kennington-Common.</HI> I chose to discourse on St. <HI>Paul'</HI>s parting Speech to the Elders at <HI>Ephesus, Acts</HI> xx. at which the People were exceedingly affected, and almost prevented my making any Application. Many Tears were shed, when I talked of Leaving them. I con∣cluded all with a suitable Hymn, but could scarce get to the Coach, for the People's throng∣ing me, to take me by the Hand, and give me a parting Blessing. And here I cannot but shut up this Part of my Journal with a Word or two of Exhortation to my dear Brethren, whosoever they are, whom GOD shall stir up to go forth into the Highways and Hedges, into the Lanes
<PB N="61" REF="004633_0030_100DB2A315DF4DE0"/>
and Streets, to compel poor Sinners to come in. You see, <HI>my dear Brethren,</HI> what great Things GOD has already done.—It is unknown how many have come to me under strong Convictions of their fallen Estate, and what Numbers of Bills I have received from Persons seeking CHRIST, desiring to be awakened to a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ense of Sin, and giving Thanks for the Benefits GOD has imparted to them by my Ministry. Letters of Invitation have been sent me from different Parts of the Kingdom. <HI>O my dear Brethren,</HI> have Compassion on our dear LORD's Church, which he has purchased with his own Blood.—Suffer none of them to be as Sheep having no Shepherd, or worse than none, those blind Lead∣ers of the Blind, who let them perish for Lack of Knowledge, and are no better than Wolves in Sheep's Cloathing. If you are found faithful, you must undergo a strong Persecution. A Person in Power told me, nothing but the Fear of Strengthening my Interest. kept off the Storm. But the Enmity of the natural Man is so great against GOD, that if the Good Work, which is begun is carried on, it will soon break through all Restraints, though thereby our Enemies will confound themselves; but the Scriptures must be fulfilled. Oh arm People against a Suffering Time; exhort them always to be obedient to the higher Powers; remind them again and again, that our Kingdom is not of this World, and that it does not become Christians to resist the Powers that are ordained of GOD, but pa∣tiently to suffer for the Truth's Sake. At present
<PB N="62" REF="004633_0031_100DB2A526196330"/>
GOD calls me to Trials of a different Nature; but I am persuaded, e'er long, it will be given me not only to believe, but also to suffer for our LORD's Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. Oh let us strive together in our Prayers, that we may fight the Good Light of Faith, that we may have that Wisdom which cometh from above, that we may never suffer for our own Faults, but only for Righteousness Sake. Then will the Spirit of CHRIST and of Glory <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon our Souls, and being made perfect by suffering here, we shall be qualified to reign eternally with JESUS CHRIST hereafter. <HI>Amen, Amen!</HI></P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>The ANSWER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I NEED make no Apology for troubling your Lordship with this. As your Lordship was pleased to make me the chief Subject Matter of your <HI>last Pastoral Letter,</HI> I think it my Duty to answer it in the best Manner I can.</P>
<P>Your Lordship is to be highly commended, for the Care you have taken in Watching over the Souls of those who are committed to your Lordship's Charge.—<HI>Luke-warmness</HI> and <HI>Enthusiasm</HI> are the two Rocks, against which even well-meaning People are in Danger of sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ting. All ought to be Thankful to that Pilot, who will teach them to steer a safe and middle Course. I would gladly hope, that a <HI>Zeal for GOD in the Discharge of your Duty, and a hearty Concern for the Safety of Souls,</HI> moved your Lordship to write.—These are the Principles, I trust, which now excite me to direct this
<PB N="73" REF="004633_0036_100DB2B08D0CED58"/>
Answer to Your Lordship. And, blesse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> GOD, that I can write with somewhat of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Love and Meekness which becomes a Disci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> JESUS CHRIST, and with all that Humility <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Reverence, which is due from a Presbyter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Bishop of the Church of GOD.</P>
<P><HI>Lukewarmness</HI> and <HI>Enthusiasm,</HI> my Lord, are certainly the Bane of true Christianity. I thank Your Lordship again for your kind Cautions against them. The only Query is, <Q>Whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> there was any Occasion for Your Lordship's warning the People of your Diocess against running into either of these Extremes, upon account of any Thing I have either spoken or wrote?</Q> Your Lordship thinks there was, and you quote Passages out of my Journal to prove it; if it can be proved, I will ask publick Pardon, both of Your Lordship and Them, with all my Heart.</P>
<P>As for your Cautions against <HI>Lukewarmness,</HI> I am not much concerned in them. You do not seem to point at me in particular; unless it is where your Lordship (<HI>Page</HI> 10) informs your People, <HI>That a diligent Attendance on the Du∣ties of the Station wherein Providence has placed them, is in the strictest Sense, the Serving of GOD.</HI> None but those who condemn me unheard, can justly charge me with affirming to the contrary.</P>
<P>However, I beg Leave to observe, that your Lordship (<HI>Page</HI> 8) calls that a very imperfect State of Christianity, which is no State of Christianity at all. St. <HI>Paul</HI> writing to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Corinthians,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> Chap. 13. v. 5. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>

<HI>Examine yourselves whether ye be in the Faith, Prove your own selves.</HI> And that they might have a certain Rule, whereby to judge whether they were in the Faith, truly so called, or not, immediately adds, <HI>Know ye not your ownselves how that</HI> CHRIST JESUS <HI>is in you, except ye be Reprobates?</HI> So that according to St. <HI>Paul'</HI>s Rule, <Q>He that finds, he has hitherto contented him∣self with a bare bodily Attend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ublick Worship of GOD, and following his daily Employment on other Days, and with abstaining from the more gross and notorious Acts of Sin, and from doing any Hurt or Injury to his Neighbour, and has rested finally upon these as the Whole that Christianity requires of him,</Q> is so far from being in a very <HI>imper∣fect State,</HI> as your Lordship is pleased to affirm, (<HI>page</HI> 8) that he is in no State of Christianity at all. No, my Lord, he is a <HI>Reprobate, i e.</HI> one who at present is out of a State of Salvation; no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> can he ever have any Assurance that he is in a State of Salvation, till he <HI>Knows that</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>is in him, by the Indwelling of his Holy Spirit.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I have mistaken your Lordship's Expression, I will freely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>Another Thing, my Lord, to me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> darkly expressed in (<HI>pag.</HI> 8) (On! let not your Lord∣ship <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> angry▪ for indeed I will endeav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur to speak with all Gentleness and Humility) Your Lordship's Words are these, <HI>Nor need they any other Evidence besides those</HI> Good Dispositions <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> find in their Hearts, that the Holy Spirit of GOD co-operates with their honest Endeavours to
<PB N="75" REF="004633_0037_100DB2B2CB593A48"/>
subdue Sin and grow in Goodness.</HI> If by <HI>Good Dispositions,</HI> your Lordship only means <HI>Good In∣clinations or Desires,</HI> I deny that to be a sufficient Evidence, that the <HI>Spirit of GOD co-opera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s with their honest Endeavours to subdue Sin and grow in Goodness.</HI> For there is a great Diffe∣rence between <HI>Good Desires</HI> and <HI>Good Habits▪</HI> Many have <HI>One,</HI> who never attain to the <HI>Other.</HI> Many have good Desires to subdue Sin, and yet resting in those good Desires, Sin has always had Dominion over them. A Person sick of a Fever may desire to be in Health, but that Desire is not Health itself. In like Manner many have good Dispositions or Desires to be good, but that is not Goodness itself. And consequently Men need more Evidence than good Dispositions, to prove to themselves or others, <HI>That the Holy Spirit of GOD co-operates with their honest En∣deavours to subdue Sin.</HI> If by good Dispositions Your Lordship means good Habits wrought in the Heart by the Spirit of GOD, such as <HI>Peace, Love, Joy, Long-suffering, Goodness, Truth,</HI> &amp;c. I then agree a Man needs no other Evidence. For these are the proper and genuine Fruits of the Spirit itself.</P>
<P>Your Lordship immediately adds, <HI>Nor that, persevering in their Course, and praying to GOD for his Assistance, and relying upon the Merits of</HI> CHRIST <HI>for the Pardon of all such Sins, Failings, and Imperfections as are more or less unavoidable in this mortal State.</HI> I beg Leave to ask your Lordship, whether this does not savour too much of the common Divinity, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That we are to
<PB N="76" REF="004633_0038_100DB2B530B94440"/>
do something for ourselves; or, in other Words, that we have partly a Righteousness of our own, and that JESUS CHRIST is to MAKE UP the Deficiencies of that Righteousness? What else can your Lordship mean, by saying, <HI>That we must rely on the Merits of</HI> CHRIST, <HI>for the Pardon of all such Sins as are more or less unavoidable in this mortal State?'</HI> Did JESUS CHRIST come into the World, my Lord, only to save us from the Guilt of such Sins as are more or less una∣voidable in this mortal State? The Scriptures every where affirm, <HI>That Man hath no Righte∣ousness of his own: That there is none Righteous, no not one: That all our Righteousness is as filthy Rags;</HI> and that JESUS CHRIST died not only to save us from the Guilt of all such Sins, Failings and Infirmities, as are more or less unavoidable in this mortal State, but from all wilful Sins, and also from that original Corruption, which every Man naturally engendred of the Off-spring of <HI>Adam,</HI> brings into the World with him. I hope I have not misunderstood or overstrained Your Lordship's Expression.</P>
<P>I come now to Your Lordship's Caution against <HI>Enthusiasm.</HI> For that I suppose Your Lordship<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> intended more particularly against me.</P>
<P>And here, my Lord, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eg Leave to observe, That in my Opinion, your Lordship has by no Means been clear enough in your Definition of the Word <HI>Enthusiasm.</HI></P>
<P>According to the fair Rules of Writing, was it not first incumbent on your Lordship to shew, that the Word <HI>Enthusiast</HI> had a good as well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="77" REF="004633_0038_100DB2B530B94440"/>
bad Meaning? that it signifies no more than <HI>a Person in GOD,</HI> and consequently every Chri∣stian, in the proper Sense of the Word, is an <HI>Enthusiast?</HI> For St. <HI>Peter</HI> writes, <HI>That to us are given exceeding great and precious Promises, that by these we might be Partakers of the Divine Nature.</HI> And our Church says, If we receive the Sacrament worthily, we are one with CHRIST and CHRIST with us, we dwell in CHRIST and CHRIST in us. For which she has sufficient Warrant from our LORD'S Prayer, John 17. 20. <HI>Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on Me through their Word.</HI> Ver. 21. <HI>That they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us.</HI> Ver. 23. <HI>I in them and they in me, that they may be made perfect in one.</HI> Ver. 26. <HI>That the Love wherewith thou hast loved me, may be in them and I in them.</HI></P>
<P>But indeed your Lordship's Definition of <HI>Enthusiasm,</HI> when examined, does not convey any ill Idea at all. <Q><HI>Enthusiasm</HI> is a strong Persuasion on the Mind, that they are guided in an extraordinary Manner, by immediate Impulses and Impressions of the Spirit of GOD.</Q> Had Your Lordship said, a strong, but groundless Persuasion, that they are guided in an extraor∣dinary Manner, it would have been to your Lordship's Purpose. But to affirm without any Restriction, that a strong Persuasion that we are guided in an extraordinary Manner by immediate Impulses, is <HI>Enthusiasm</HI> in the worst Sense of the
<PB N="78" REF="004633_0039_100DB2B7E9C49C98"/>
Word, when your Lordship yourself says, (<HI>p.</HI> 54) <Q>There is no Doubt but GOD, when he pleases, can work upon the Minds of Men by extra∣ordinary Influences,</Q> to me seems a little in∣consistent.</P>
<P>Your Lordship proceeds thus: <Q>And this is owing chiefly to the Want of distinguishing aright between the ordinary and extraordinary Operations of the Holy Spirit. The extra∣ordinary Operations were those by which the Apostles and Others, who were entrusted with the first Propagation of the Gospel, were ena∣bled to work Miracles, and speak with Tongues, in Testimony, that their Mission and Doctrine were from GOD.</Q></P>
<P>I suppose, by extraordinary Operations, Your Lordship means the same as being guided in an extraordinary Manner just above. And if so, according to your Lordship's own Definition, I am no <HI>Enthusiast.</HI> For I never did pretend to these extraordinary Operations of working Mira∣cles or speaking with Tongues, in Testimony that my Mission and Doctrine were from GOD; I only lay Claim to the ordinary Gifts and Influen∣ces of the Spirit, which your Lordship (<HI>pag.</HI> 20) says, <HI>'still continue.'</HI> And what Need was there then, my Lord, that the People of your Diocese should be cautioned against <HI>Enthusiasm</HI> on my Account?</P>
<P>But your Lordship farther adds, <Q>the ordinary Gifts, however real and certain in themselves, are no otherwise discernable than by their Fruits and Effects.</Q> Had your Lordship said,
<PB N="79" REF="004633_0039_100DB2B7E9C49C98"/>
no otherwise discernible to others than by their Fruits and Effects, it would have been right. But if your Lordship means they are no other∣wise discernible to ourselves, in my Opinion it is wrong: For it is possible, my Lord, for a Per∣son to feel and discern these ordinary Gifts and Influences of the Spirit in himself, when there is no Opportunity of discovering them to others. For Instance, on Supposition that your Lordship was assisted by the blessed Spirit in writing your Pastoral Letter,—might not your Lordship be sensible of an inward Joy and Complacency, wrought by that self same Spirit, which was not then discernible to others? So likewise it is pos∣sible for another to feel Joy in the Holy Ghost▪ with the rest of his Fruits, which at that Time▪ may not be discernible to others; and which they who have never experienced the like may not believe, though a Man declare it unto them. I hope, my Lord, these Reasonings carry with them their own Evidence.</P>
<P>But to proceed (<HI>Pag.</HI> 20,21,22,23,24,25). Your Lordship has taken Pains to collect several Passages out of the publick Liturgy, to prove the Doctrine of Regeneration or our New-Birth, to be the Doctrine of the <HI>Church of England.</HI> Your Reason for so doing, appears (<HI>pag.</HI> 23) <Q>to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> your People against any Suggestions, as of our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> were regardless of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Regeneration and New-Birth, as if there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Need for any Member of it to see<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> elsewhere for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> spiritual Service.</Q> I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this, my Lord, was Intended to arm your People against any
<PB N="80" REF="004633_0040_100DB2B9C12E69F8"/>
such Suggestions made by me; indeed your Lordship does not do me Justice. As your Lordship, I find, has done me the Honour to peruse my third Journal, your Lordship may remember this Observation (<HI>Page</HI> 206) that, after I had baptized an Adult, I proved the Necessity of the New-Birth, from the Office of our Church.</P>
<P>In my Sermon upon the <HI>Indwelling of the Spirit of GOD,</HI> which I have made bold to send your Lordship with this Letter, you will find I have quoted the Expressions of our own Church Offices, to prove the Doctrine of the New-Birth, as your Lordship does in your Pastoral Letter. My constant Way of Preaching is, first, to prove my Propositions by Scripture, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to illu∣strate them by the Articles and Collects of the <HI>Church of England.</HI> Those that have heard me, can witness, how often I have exhorted them to be constant at the publick Service of the Church. I attend on it myself, and would read the public Liturgy every Day, if your Lordship's Clergy would give me Leave. What further Satisfaction can your Lordship require, that I do not suggest to your Lordship's People, <Q>as if our Church were regardless of the Doctrine of Regenera∣tion and New-Birth, and as if there were Need for any Member of it, to seek elsewhere for a more spiritual Service?</Q></P>
<P>In the following Paragraph, your Lordship has the same Insinuation, as though I wanted to introduce Extempore Prayer, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to lay aside the publick Liturgy of our Church. For after your Lordship had been speaking against Praying by
<PB N="81" REF="004633_0040_100DB2B9C12E69F8"/>
the Spirit, and affirming that the Scripture no where tells us, that Prayer is the single Work of the Spirit your Lordship says to your People, <HI>You have great Reason to be thankful to God for a publick Service prepared to your Hands.</HI> My Lord, I never said to the Contrary. But does not your Lordship seem to insinuate at the same Time, that we are not to depend on the Spirit of GOD to enable us to pray Extempore, either in public or private? That Prayer is not the single Work of the Spirit, without any Co-operation of our own, I readily confess. But that the Spirit of GOD does assist true Christians to pray extem∣pore now, as well as formerly, is undeniable if the Scriptures be true. For what says the Apo∣stle? <HI>We know not what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit itself helpeth our Infirmities, and maketh Intercession for us with Groanings that cannot be uttered.</HI> And this is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon a general Promise made to all GOD's People. <HI>Zacharias</HI> 12. 10. <HI>I will pour upon the House of</HI> David, <HI>and upon the Inhabitants of</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Grace and of Supplication.</HI> And I believe, my Lord, we may appeal to the Experi∣ence of all true Christians, whether or no they did not find the Spirit of Supplication, or a Power of Praying without a Form, encrease in Proportion to the Increase of GOD's Grace or Holy Spirit in their Hearts. This is all, my Lord, that I pretend to: And where is the Impropriety of this, when your Lordship confesses in the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me <HI>Page, that the Spirit of GOD does particularly assist us, in a due Performance of Religious Offices?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="004633_0041_100DB2BC8E2F60D0"/>
Farther, as your Lordship seems to deny the immediate Assistance of the Holy Spirit in our particular Addresses at the Throne of Grace, so your Lordship seems to deny it also in our par∣ticular Actions. <Q>In like Manner, your Lord∣ship says, we are firmly persuaded in general, that we live under he gracious Influence of GOD's Holy Spirit, and that he both excites and enables us to do Good. But that this or that Thought or Action is an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ct of the sole Motion or immediate Impulse of the Spirit, without any Co-operation of our own Mind.</Q>—My Lord, who ever affirmed that there was no Co-operation of our own Minds, together with the Impulse of the Spirit of GOD? Your Lord∣ship adds, <Q>Or that the Holy Spirit, and our natural Conceptions, do respectively contribute to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or that Thought or Action, in such a Measure, or to such a Degree; these are Things we dare not say.</Q> Indeed, my Lord, <HI>I dare say them.</HI> For i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there be any such Thing as a particular Providence, why may we not expect particular Directions from GOD's Holy Spirit in particular Cases?

then? Does not your Lordship know when it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> an Impression upon your Body? So easy is it for a spiritual Man to know when the Holy Spirit makes an Impression upon his Soul. With out acknowledging this, all the Expressions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> being, led by the Spirit, walking by the Spirit and such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, must be only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> many Word <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> any real Meaning. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Lordship acknowledges, that the Holy Spirit does act i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> general, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not in the particular Action<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> also?

I have been the more particular, my Lord, on this Part of your Lordship's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, because if this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, many of your Lord∣ship's Objections against my Journals will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the Ground.</P>
<P><HI>Page</HI> 27, Your Lordship has the following Paragraph. <Q>GOD forbid that in this prof<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Age, every Thing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> that it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of.

<P>I take it for granted, that I am one of those Men whom your Lordship thinks should be
<PB N="84" REF="004633_0042_100DB2BE7A82E5A8"/>
called upon for some reasonable Evidence of a Divine Commission.</P>
<P>But, my Lord, what reasonable Evidence does your Lordship require? Did I not receive Letters dimissory from your Lordship's own Hands to be ordained Priest? Did I not, when ordained Deacon affirm, <HI>That I was inwardly moved by the Holy Ghost, to take upon me that Office and Ministration?</HI> Did not my Lord of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> when he ordained me Priest, say unto me, <HI>Receive thou the Holy Ghost, now committed unto thee by the Imposition of our Hands, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost?</HI> And is not this, my Lord▪ a reasonable Evidence that I act by a Divine Commission? If this be not true, must not all those whom your Lord∣ship, or the other Bishops ordain, act only by a human Commission? Nay (to use the Words of Bishop <HI>Burnet</HI> in his Pastoral Letter) <HI>Must not they who are ordained, Lie, not only unto Man but unto GOD, by saying, They are inwardly moved by the Holy Spirit?</HI></P>
<P>If your Lordship in any wise disputes my acting by a Divine Commission, you disclaim your own Divine Right and Authority; nor can you possibly avoid the Dilemma, of either al∣lowing my Divine Commission, or denying your own.</P>
<P>After Your Lordship has insinuated a Demand for the Evidences of my Divine Com∣mission, immediately follows these Words, <HI>When they tell us of extraordinary Communications they have with GOD.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="004633_0042_100DB2BE7A82E5A8"/>
If by extraordinary Communications, your Lordship means the extraordinary Operations of the Holy Spirit, as Working Miracles, and Speaking with Tongues; your Lordship may assure yourself, I never pretend to any such Thing.—If, by extraordinary Communications, your Lordship means more Assistances and Com∣forts from GOD at some Times than I have at others (which is all I mean by extraordinary Communications) I own the Charge. And what is there▪ my Lord, extraordinary in that?</P>
<P>Again, Your Lordship says (<HI>Page</HI> 28) <HI>When they talk in the Language of those who have a special and immediate Mission from GOD.</HI></P>
<P>And does your Lordship, and the rest of the Bishops, ordain any, without obliging them first to give good Proofs, that they have a special Call or immediate Mission from GOD to the Work of the Ministry? If ever you so do, my Lord, doth not your Lordship lay Hands too suddenly upon Men?</P>
<P>(<HI>Page</HI> 29) Your Lordship writes thus.—<HI>When they profess to think and act under the im∣mediate Guidance of a Divine Inspiration.</HI></P>
<P>And does not your Lordship think and act▪ by the same Rule? Why otherwise does your Lordship pray, when you administer the Holy Communion, <HI>that GOD would cleanse the Thoughts of our Hearts by the Inspiration of his Holy Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>(<HI>Page</HI> 31) Your Lordship says, <HI>When they speak of their Preaching and Expounding, and the Effects of them, as the sole Work of a Divine Power.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="004633_0043_100D8606A79E0378"/>
And would your Lordship have me ascribe any Thing in the least to myself?</P>
<P>The Good that is done upon Earth, doth not GOD do it himself? Does not the Apostle say, <HI>Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any Thing as of ourselves, but our S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>cienc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is of GOD?</HI> And where then, my Lord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is the Ab∣surdity of ascribing the Effect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Expounding and Preaching to the sole Work of a Divine Power?</P>
<P>Again▪ <HI>Page</HI> 33) <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> sudden and surprising Effects as wrought by the Holy Ghost, in Consequence of their Preaching.</HI></P>
<P>Where, my Lord, is the Enthusiasm of such a Pretension? Has your Lordship been a Preacher in the <HI>Church of England,</HI> for so many Years, and have you never seen any sudden or surprising Effects consequent upon your Lordship's Preach∣ing? Was this my Case, should I not have Reason to doubt, my Lord, whether I had any more than a bare human Commission? Or might I not take up the Prophet's Lamentation, <HI>Oh my Leaness, my Leaness!</HI> My Lord, the Gospel, like its Author, is the same Yesterday, to Day and forever; and, if preached as it ought to be, will prick Numbers to the Heart, and extort the Cry of the trembling Goa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, <HI>What must I do to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e saved?</HI> as surely Now, as it did Seventeen Hundred Years ago.</P>
<P>These then are the sudden and surprizing Effects, my Lord, I always desire to have, and heartily pray GOD your Lordship and all your Clergy may always see such Effects in Conse∣quence of their Preaching.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="004633_0043_100D8606A79E0378"/>
(<HI>Page</HI> 34) <HI>When they claim the Spirit of Prophecy.</HI></P>
<P>What I have said about my Success, GOD has been pleased to fulfil already. What I have said about Sufferings, they who without Cause are my Enemies, are fulfilling daily. And as for the Promises mentioned in my Journal, I freely own there are some particular Promises which GOD has so strongly impressed and does still impress on my Heart, that I verily believe they will be fulfilled.</P>
<P>(<HI>Page</HI> 35) <HI>When they speak of themselves in the Language, and under the Character of Apostles of</HI> CHRIST, <HI>and even of</HI> CHRIST <HI>himself.</HI></P>
<P>If I am not to speak in an Apostolical Language, why did my Lord of <HI>Gloucester</HI> give me an Apostolical Commission, <HI>Whose Sins thou d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st forgive, they are forgiven; and whose Sins thou dost retain, they are retained.</HI> And I hope▪ my Lord, using the Words which JESUS CHRIST used, is not taking upon me the Character of CHRIST.</P>
<P>(<HI>Page</HI> 36) <HI>When they profess to plant and propagate a New Gospel, as unknown to the Generality of Ministers and People in a Christian Country.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis true, my Lord, in one Sense, mine is a New Gospel, and always will be unknown to the Generality of Ministers and People, even in a Christian Country, if your Lordship's Clergy follow your Lordship's Directions. For what says your Lordship (Page 46) <HI>I hope that when Ministers preach to you of Justification by Faith
<PB N="88" REF="004633_0044_100DB2C293829548"/>
alone, which is asserted in the strongest Manner by our Church, they explain it in such a Manner as to leave no Doubt upon your Mind, whether good Works are a necessary Condition of your being justified in the Sight of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>But pray, my Lord, where has the Scripture made good Works a necessary Condition of our being justified in the Sight of GOD? St. <HI>Paul</HI> says, <HI>By Grace ye are saved, thro' Faith, not of Works, and that lost any Man should boast; for Eternal Life is the Gift of GOD through</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>our LORD.</HI> Your Lordship exhorts your Clergy to preach Justification by Faith alone, and quotes the 11th Article of our Church, which tells us, <HI>we are justified by Faith only, and not for our own Works or Deservings.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See the</HI> 11<HI>th,</HI> 12<HI>th and</HI> 13<HI>th Articles of our Church.</HI></NOTE> At the same Time your Lordship bids them, <HI>explain it in such a Manner as to leave no Doubt upon their Minds, whether good Works are a necessary Con∣dition of their being justified in the Sight of GOD,</HI> Your Lordship, in my Opinion, could not well be guilty of a greater Inconsistency. This, my Lord, is truly a New Gospel. I am sure it is not what the Apostles preached; and it is as contrary to the Doctrine of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> and the whole Tenor of the Gospel, as Darkness is contrary to Light. Had your Lordship insisted on your Clergy's preaching up good Works <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a necessary Fruit and Consequence, instead of a necessary Condition of our being justified, your Lordship would have used your Authority aright.
<PB N="89" REF="004633_0044_100DB2C293829548"/>
For we are commanded to shew forth or declare to others, that we have a True Faith by our Works. And the 12th Article of our Church says, <HI>that good Works follow after Justification;</HI> and how then, my Lord, are they <HI>a necessary Condition of our Justification?</HI> No, my Lord, Salvation (if the Gospel be true) is the free Gift of GOD through JESUS CHRIST. Faith is the Means whereby that Salvation is applied to our Hearts, and good Works are the necessary Fruits and Proof of that Faith.</P>
<P>This, my Lord, is the Doctrine of JESUS CHRIST, this is the Doctrine of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> and it is because the Generality of the Clergy of the <HI>Church of England</HI> do not preach this Doctrine, that I am resolved, GOD being my Helper, to continue instant in Season and out of Season, to declare <HI>IT</HI> unto all Men, let the Consequences, as to my own private Person, be what they will.</P>
<P>As for your Lordship's blaming me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r rashly censuring the Clergy for their Practice, none are concerned but my <HI>Indolent, Earthly-minded, Pleasure taking</HI> Brethren (<HI>Page</HI> 39) And surely Your Lordship will not stand up in their Defence. No,—I hope your Lordship will not fail to rebuke Them <HI>sharply.</HI> And as for your Lord∣ship's Suspicions
(<HI>Page</HI> 50) (For your Lordship's Sake I would not mention them) I hope my Life and Doctrine—will always prove them to be groundless.</P>
<P>Would Time permit, I could now proceed to satisfy your Lordship more particularly about the
<PB N="90" REF="004633_0045_100DB2C43547D8C8"/>
Case of Mr. <HI>Benjamin Seward;</HI> but as that is done in a Letter sent to my Lord of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> and published in my last Journal; and as I am now to embark in a few Hours, I hope Your Lordship will excuse me, if I only add my hearty Prayers for Your Lordship's temporal and eternal Welfare, and subscribe myself,</P>

<P><HI>Tuesday, August</HI> 14. Got on board about Eight last Night, and received the following Letter from <HI>Thomas Webb,</HI> Clerk of the Parish of <HI>Bretforton</HI> in <HI>Worcestershire;</HI> whom Mr. <HI>Benj. Seward</HI> mentioned in a Letter, published in my last Journal.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend and Worthy SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Altho' I am unknown to you in Person, yet as I trust I am, by the Grace of GOD, awa∣ken'd to a New and Spiritual Life, thro' the powerful Influence of your Ministry, I think myself under an Obligation to give my Testi∣mony to the Truth as it is in JESUS; and to pay my grateful Acknowledgments to the Free∣dom of that Divine Grace which has made you so wonderfully instrumental in Calling me, a most unworthy Sinner, at this last Hour of the Day, from a state of Darkness and Insensibili∣ty, to the marvellous Light of his glorious Gospel. The Circumstances of my Conversion were as follows. I heard you was to preach on <HI>Thursday</HI> the 19th of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> last at Mr. <HI>Seward's</HI> of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>:</HI> and living at <HI>Bretforton,</HI> a Village about a Mile from thence (where I have been Clerk of the Parish for about thirty Years, being now in the Sixty-third Year of my Age) my Curiosity, as I then should have termed it; but, as it is since evident by the Consequence, the wonderful Goodness and Providence of Almighty GOD, led me to hear
<PB N="92" REF="004633_0046_100DB2C65DF80EE0"/>
you, which I did with great Attention, and was much affected. The next Day being <HI>Good Friday,</HI> I attended your Ministry again, with great Warmth, when you spoke with such Demonstration of the Spirit, and with Power, from these Words, <HI>Watch therefore,</HI> &amp;c. That I soon was convinced I was in the State of the foolish Virgins, who were unprepar'd to meet the Bridegroom, having all my Life long taken up with the Lamp of an outward Profession, thinking it sufficient, that I duly and constant∣ly attended the publick Worship, Sacraments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but I soon found, to my great Confusion, that I had all my Life long been offering to GOD the Sacrifice of Fools; being destitute of the pure Oil of Grace in the Heart, which could alone make me meet to attend the Mar∣riage Feast of the Supper of the Lamb. The New-Birth, Justification by Faith only, the want of free Will in Man to do good Works without the special Grace of GOD, and the like, was as it were new Language to me: For tho' I remembred the Letter of these Doctrines, yet the spiritual Sense thereof, I was an utter Stranger to: But being very much oppressed in Thought, concering most important Truths which you delivered, as soon as I returned home, I search'd an old Exposition of the Ca∣techism, the Church Articles, and Book of Homilies, which I found exactly to correspond with what I had heard deliver'd by you.—Some Days after this, I being a Taylor by Trade, was sent for to Work at a little Ale-House,
<PB N="93" REF="004633_0046_100DB2C65DF80EE0"/>
called <HI>Conter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>up,</HI> where (tho' one of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st Places I should have expected Food for the Soul) the Man of the House told me he had some old Books which he had of one Mr. <HI>F—</HI> a Glazier and Plumber in <HI>Tweksbury,</HI> who had thrown them by, in order to send them to the Paper Mill, as fit for no other purpose; but he begged they might be given to him; that he had heard Mr. <HI>Whitefield;</HI> had got his Sermons on the New-Birth, and that these old Books spoke to the very same Purpose as Mr. <HI>White∣field</HI> did: Upon which I desired to see one of them (the other being then lent out) the Title whereof was <Q>General Directions for a comfor∣table Walking with GOD, by <HI>Robert Bolton</HI></Q> an old Divine of our own Church. I had not read long, before the Light broke in upon my Soul, with such powerful Evidence, that I was from that Instant clearly convinced, and, I hope by the Grace of GOD, determined not to know any Thing, save JESUS CHIRST and him crucified. Upon this I avoided all carnal Acquaintance and Reasoning, as much as pos∣sible; constantly attended the Religious Socie∣ty at <HI>Badsey;</HI> where, by hearing your Sermons, and other Religious Exercises, I daily was strengthened and comforted. Soon after this I got the other old Book, which was so pro∣videntially preserved from the Paper-Mill: The title whereof was as f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llows, <Q>Six Evan∣gelical Histories, <HI>Water turn'd into Wine. The Temple's Purgation. Christ and Nicodemus.</HI> John'<HI>s last Testimony. Christ and the Woman

<P>This old Book has been a very grateful Cordial to my Soul; and tho' I have lived under the Sound of the Gospel for so many Years, and thought I did not want to be taught the first Principles of Christianity at this Age, being, as I apprehended, well thought of, and esteem'd by all my Neighbours▪ yet I am fully convinced, that I knew nothing as I ought to know; and that the Gospel was to me a sealed Book; but by the wonderful free Grace of GOD, tho' before I had Eyes that saw not, Ears, and heard not, I now received it as a Savour of Life unto Life; and can say experi∣mentally, that the Word of GOD is a Light unto my Feet, and a Lanthorn to my Paths.—For this Declaration of the Truth, I have suffered the Reproach and Derision of them that were round about me: But I trust, that the Grace of GOD, which hath called me when so old and dead in Trespasses and Sins, will also touch the Hearts of my Opposers, and work in them both to will and to do of his good Pleasure. I have been even threatn'd with the loss of my Bread, for the Profession of the Truth; but I hope GOD will turn the Hearts of my Enemies; if not, and it were his blessed Will, I hope I should be enabled to lay down my Life in Defence of the Gospel,

<HI>Wednesday, August</HI> 15. Began to put those of my Family who were prepared for it, into Bands. In all we are 8 Men, 4 Women, 1 Boy and 2 Children, besides Mr. <HI>Seward</HI> and myself. The Conversion of one of the Men was particularly remarkable.—Not long since he was Master of a Ship which was lost near the Gulf of <HI>Florida.</HI> Providence was pleas'd to throw him and his Crew upon an Island, where they continually expected the Waters to overflow them. At the End of ten Days, they saw a Ship, and gave a Signal of Distress: The Ship made towards them. The Captain, now with me, went out with his Boat, and begged for a Passage for him∣self and Men.—It was granted him on Condition he would leave some of his Crew behind upon the Island; but he would not consent: At length the other Commander agreed to take all. But as soon as ever my Friend put off the Boat to fetch his Men, the Commander made Sail and lest them. All this seemed quite <HI>against,</HI> but in the End GOD shewed it was intended <HI>for</HI> the Good of my Friend. After 30 Days Continu∣ance upon the Island, having fitted up the Boat with some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lanks they took out of a Ship which had been lost 5 Months before, <HI>Nine</HI> of them committed themselves to the Providence of GOD: The others cared not to venture themselves in so small a Boat. Having failed about 140 Leagues, they came at length to <HI>Ty<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> Island▪ 15 Miles off <HI>Savannah.</HI> An Inhabitant being near the Place, espied them, and brought them Home with him. I being inform'd what had happen'd,
<PB N="97" REF="004633_0048_100DB2CD84FC61E8"/>
invited the Captain to Breakfast with me; and reminded him of the Goodness of GOD: He then seem'd serious; and coming very providen∣tially in the same Ship with me, when I returned from <HI>Georgia,</HI> GOD was pleased to work more effectually upon his Soul. And he is now re∣turning with me to <HI>Georgia</HI> again. Many Offers have been made him to go into the World; but he rather chuses to suffer Affliction with the Peo∣ple of GOD. Most of my other Assistants have left good Places, and are willing freely to spend and be spent for the Good of the <HI>Orphan House.</HI> Several of them have already found, all I hope are seeking, CHRIST. We seem perfectly set∣tled already; and whatever Storms GOD may permit to attack us without, I hope we shall have a constant Peace within and among ourselves.—Blessed be GOD, I find myself compos'd, and perfectly resign'd; nay, much rejoiced at my present Situation. <HI>Oh that I could always have no other Will but GOD's!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thursday, August</HI> 16. Had still greater Rea∣son to rejoice at the Regulation of my Family. Wrote several Letters; and began to have pub∣lick Prayers Morning and Evening; and spent above an Hour in exhorting and examining into the Interiours of my Fellow-Travellers, and went to Bed almost forgetful that I had ever been out in the World. <HI>Forever blessed be GOD's Holy Name, thro'</HI> CHRIST.</P>
<P><HI>Friday, August</HI> 17. Had a brisk, but favour∣able Gale, which carried us directly thro' the <HI>Downs.</HI>—Sent some Letters on Shore, and rejoiced
<PB N="98" REF="004633_0049_100DB2CF31EE7C68"/>
much in my happy Settlement on board. In the Morning most of my Family were sick; I did not entirely escape: GOD enabled us to give Thanks; and as we came to sail more directly before the Wind, our Disorder gradually went off. Thus is humane Life chequer'd. I bless GOD we are in good Order; And if the Voyage ends as happily as it begins, we shall have abundant Reason to bless GOD for it. <HI>Grant this, O</HI> LORD, <HI>for thy dear Son's sake!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, August</HI> 18. Made but small Ad∣vances in our Way, there being but little Wind, and that not very fair, till about 6 this Evening, at which Time it favoured us very much. Was enlighten'd in Reading GOD's Word. Had my Heart warmed with a Sense of his Love and distinguishing Mercies. Was enlarged in Praying several Times with and for my Friends; and was very earnest with GOD to give me Grace to improve my present Retirement to his Glory, the Good of his Church, and the Edification of my own Soul. Perceived also my bodily Strength to encrease, and enjoyed such unspeakable Peace and Tranquility within, that I was often filled with a Holy Confusion, and was obliged to retire to give my Soul vent.—Our LORD, I am sure, sails with us. <HI>O infinitely condescending GOD!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, August</HI> 19. Administred the Holy Sacrament early this Morning. Sung an Hymn and continued in Prayer for near an Hour after∣wards, in Behalf of ourselves and absent Friends. My Heart was much melted down <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> enlarged. The Power which was given me was soon com∣municated
<PB N="99" REF="004633_0049_100DB2CF31EE7C68"/>
to my Companions: They sympa∣thized and wept with me. A Spirit of Love seem'd to be sent forth amongst us. <HI>May it in∣crease ever more and more.</HI></P>
<P>Both at Morning and Evening Prayers the Captain and Ships Company attended very order∣ly. The Remainder of the Day was spent in Reading, Prayer, Singing and Praising GOD. The Ship continued sailing directly before the Wind, at the Rate of about 5 or 6 Miles an Hour:—Most seem'd sensible of, and thankful for the Divine Mercies. <HI>Thanks be to GOD for this unspeakable Gift.</HI> Amen, <HI>Lord JESUS.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, August</HI> 20. Fair Wind all Night, by which our Ship was carried to the Bay of <HI>Biscay,</HI> and went before the Wind at 6 Miles an Hour, almost the whole Day. The Wind being brisk, and a great Swell coming out of the Bay, most of us grew sick, and could do little else but lie down upon our Beds. This rejoiced me much; for I had a glorious Opportunity of spending many Hours in strict Communion with GOD, to ask Pardon for the Defects of my publick Ministry, and to pray for Strength against future Work and Trials. My Soul was frequently dissolved into Tears.—A Sense of my actual Sins and natural Deformity, humbled me exceedingly: And then the Freeness and Riches of GOD's Everlasting Love, broke in with such Light and Power upon my Soul, that I was often awed into Silence, and could not speak any more.—A dear Companion was with me, and help'd me to lament, pray, and give Praise. <HI>Oh the Comforts
<PB N="100" REF="004633_0050_100DB33A120EC998"/>
of Religious Friendship! Sanctify it, O LORD, to me, for thy dear Son's sake!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tuesday, August</HI> 21. Contrary Winds all Day, and the Swell continuing, kept all my Family, as well as myself, a little sickish. I conversed with GOD by Prayer and his Word most of the Time, and felt Enlargement of Heart in the Evening. <HI>Oh that by Conversing with GOD I may be changed from Glory to Glory, and fitted for what∣ever he has appointed for me to do or suffer, during my Pilgrimage here on Earth!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, August</HI> 25. Had but little regular Sleep since <HI>Tuesday;</HI> the Winds continuing con∣trary:—Last Night it blew a hard Gale. Most of my Family still continues sick;—I waited on them as well as I could, and prayed to GOD to make me willing to become the Servant of ALL. Frequently interceded for absent Friends, and remembred those in particular, who by their kind Presents administred much to our Comfort on Board. Had two or three providential Confe∣rences with the Captain of the Ship, and some of the Men. Read Dr. <HI>Guise</HI> his Paraphrase on the Evangelist St. <HI>Matthew;</HI> I think it the best I ever met with. Endeavoured to keep close to GOD, by Watching unto Prayer, for Direction and Help in Time of Need. Frequently was enlighten'd to see the Pride and Selfishness of my Heart; and as frequently long'd for that perfect Liberty wherewith JESUS CHRIST sets his Ser∣vants free. The Sea was calmer to Day than before.—My Family grew better, and we spent near two Hours this Evening, in talking of the
<PB N="101" REF="004633_0050_100DB33A120EC998"/>
inward State of our Souls, and preparing for the Reception of the blessed Sacrament. <HI>LORD, grant that we all may have on a Wedding Gar∣ment.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday August</HI> 26. Administred the Holy Sacrament early this Morning.—Spent the Re∣mainder of the Day in Reading, Intercession, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> GOD was pleased to enlighten me in Reading his holy Word,—and gave me Satisfaction in the Behaviour of those about me. The Wind was still contrary, and the Sea rough, but I had a great Calm and Joy in my Soul. <HI>How can I be thankful enough for the glorious Opportunity I now enjoy for Self-Improvement. Let all that is within me, praise GOD's holy Name.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, August</HI> 27. Had the Pleasure of seeing three <HI>Jamaica</HI> Ships come altogether: Two of which spoke to us, and by them we sent News of our Situation to <HI>England.</HI> Was much assisted in Writing an Account of GOD's Deal∣ings with me in my infant Days, which I have prayed for Strength to do these three Years, but never had Power given me till this Day. Blessed be GOD, the Weather was more calm, the Wind more fair, and my Family better and better; so that I trust we shall get Strength against future Crosses.—As yet this is the most comfortable Voyage I have made. <HI>Oh that I may grow in Grace, and then my Happiness will encrease daily!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tuesday, August</HI> 28. Calm Weather and smooth Sea. Was assisted in Reading the holy Scrip∣tures. Rejoiced much in the good Behaviour of

<P><HI>Friday, August</HI> 31. Very light Winds for two Days last pas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and an entire Calm to Day; but GOD was pleased to send me many inward Strugglings.—I could do Nothing but lay myself down, and offer my Soul up to GOD.—At Night I prayed with strong Cryings and many Tears before all my Family, for them and all those dear People who have recommended themselves to my Prayers.—Afterwards my Soul received Comfort. <HI>Oh that these inward <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> may purge, humble and purify my polluted, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and treacherous Heart!

<P><HI>Saturday, Sept.</HI> 15. Had a pleasant Prospect to Day of some of the Western Islands. Gave myself to Reading the Word of GOD, and Prayer, the most Part of this Week. Was visited with frequent inward Trials. Had many Things on my Heart to write, but am as yet withheld. Ended the Week comfortably with my Family, and was exceedingly strengthen'd in reading Professor <HI>Frank'</HI>s Account of the Orphan-house of <HI>Glaucha</HI> in <HI>Hall.</HI>—It seems in many Circumstances, to be so exactly parallel to my present Undertaking for the Poor of <HI>Georgia,</HI> that I trust the Orphan-house about to be erected there, will be carried on and ended with the like Faith and Success. <HI>Amen, Amen.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, Sept.</HI> 16. Administred the Sacrament, and had a Love-Feast afterwards. Expounded as usual at Morning and Evening Prayers.—GOD's Power was amongst us. The Day was calm and clear; and tho' we do not go forwards much in our Course, yet I trust we shall every Day be fitted more and more, for those various Turns of Providence which I expect we shall meet with when we come to Shore. <HI>Let thy Grace, O LORD, be more than sufficient for us.

<PB N="105" REF="004633_0052_100DB2D1B4588EF8"/>
Remembrance of my Sins, and the bitter Conse∣quences of them.—Surely my Sorrows were so great, that had not GOD in the Midst of them, comforted my Soul, the Lord would have been insupportable.—All the While, I was assured GOD had forgiven me, but I could not forgive myself, for sinning against so much Light and Love.—Methought I felt something of that which <HI>Adam</HI> felt when turned out of Paradise: <HI>David</HI> when he was convicted of his Adultery; and <HI>Peter</HI> when with Oaths and Curses he thrice denied his Master.—I then, if ever, did truly smite upon my ungrateful Breast, and cry, <HI>GOD be merciful to me a Sinner.</HI> I eat but very little, and went mourning all the Day long.—At length my LORD looked upon me, and with that Look melted my rocky Heart, and Floods of contrite Tears flowed out before my whole Family; and indeed I wept most bitterly.—When in this Condition, I wonder'd not at <HI>Peter'</HI>s running so slowly to the Sepulchre, when loaded with a Sense of Guilt.—Alas! a Consideration of ag∣gravated Crimes quite took off my Chariot-Wheels, and I drove so exceeding heavily, that was I always to see myself such a Sinner as I am, and as I did then, I should not be able so much as to look up. This latter Part of the Week, <HI>blessed be the LORD,</HI> he has restored me the Light of his Countenance, and enlarged my Heart to write freely, and praise him with joyful Lips. Our Ship being got Southwardly into the Trade Winds, and the Weather warm. I and some of my Companions lay upon Duck. We

<P><HI>Sunday, Sept.</HI> 23. Had a sweet Sacrament, and Love Feast afterwards. Was much streng∣then'd both in my Morning and Evening Exer∣cises; and selt such Intenseness of Comfort, and Warmth of Heart towards my absent Friends, as made me for a while forget the Anguish I lately felt; but at Night a Sense of my Sins weighed me down again, and I mourned in my Prayers and was vexed.—Alas! how are they mistaken, that go out of the World to avoid Temptations.—I never am so much tempted as when confined on Ship-board:—A Mercy, this, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n GOD, to keep me in Action, and prepare me for future Blessings. <HI>Luther</HI> says, <Q>He never undertook any fresh Work, but he was either visited with a Fit of Sickness, or some strong Temptation.</Q> Prayer, Meditation and Temp∣tations are necessary Accomplishments in his Account, for every Minister. <HI>May I follow him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e followed</HI> CHRIST!</P>
<P><HI>Saturday, Sept.</HI> 29. Administred the Holy Sacrament this Morning.

ample Recompence for the Trials of the last Week.—Thus does GOD sometimes humble and sometimes exalt; all his Dispensations perfect the Regenerate Soul. Had little Time for Reading, but this Afternoon was exceedingly strengthened by perusing some Paragraphs out of the Book called <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Preacher,</HI> written by Dr. <HI>Edwards</HI> of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and extracted by Mr. <HI>Jonathan Warn,</HI> in his Books entitled, <HI>The Church of England Man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Back-Door to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> There are such noble Testimonies given before that University, of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by Faith alone; the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> CHRIST; <HI>our having no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>,</HI> &amp;c. that they deserve to be written in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Gold.

<P><HI>Sunday, September</HI> 30. Administred the Holy Sacrament, and had a Love-Feast. Expounded with Power in the Morning to the Sailors, and lent my Cabbin in the Afternoon to the Quaker Preacher.—He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with much Earnestness; but in my Opinion, his Foundation was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. He seem'd to make the Light of natural Con∣science, and the Holy Spirit one and the same Thing, and represented CHRIST within, and not CHRIST without, for the Foundation of our Faith:—Whereas the outward Righteousness of

<P><HI>Saturday, October</HI> 6. Contrary Winds most Part of this Week, and made a very slow Pro∣gress towards <HI>Philadelphia.</HI> Had great Assistance in Writing, and strong Convictions of my past Sins. Held a close Band for some Hours this Evening, with my whole Family, wherein we open'd our Hearts, confessed our Faults to, and pray'd for one another. <HI>Do thou, O great and mighty Physician of Souls, hear and heal us.</HI>—Amen <HI>and</HI> Amen.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday, October</HI> 7. Administred the Holy Sacrament, had a Love-Feast and expounded as usual. The Wind blowing very fresh, the Ship Men were obliged to attend the Sails, and so could not come to publick Worship. Sailed sometimes 9 Miles an Hour, for which we endeavoured to praise the LORD. Had com∣fortable Communion with GOD, in interceding for our dear Friends on Shore; and at Night felt such Freedom in my Spirit, from a Load I labour'd under, as caused me to break out into many Thansgivings to GOD. Every Day more and more convinces me, that the LORD will fulfil the Desires of them that fear him: He is the Father of Mercies; He is the GOD of all Consolation; He can create Comfort out of Nothing, and bring Comfort out of the greatest

<P><HI>Friday, Octob.</HI> 12. Kept a Family Fast this Day, that we might afflict ourselves before our GOD; to seek of him a right Way for us and for our little Ones, and for all our Substance: I trust it was such a Fast as the LORD would chuse: His Divine Presence was amongst us, and we had good Reason to hope and believe, that the LORD was entreated of us, <HI>Oh that we may find more and more Reason to say so, when we come on shore.

<P><HI>Saturday, Octob.</HI> 13. Still GOD is pleased to send us contrary Winds, but very warm and pleasant Weather. The Power of Writing has been in a great Measure taken from me; but GOD has been with me in Reading, Expounding and my other Exercises of Devotion. Have experienced some blessed Teachings of his Holy Spirit, in convicting me of the Pride, Sensuality and Blindness of my own Heart, and of the Advantages Satan has gain'd over me by working
<PB N="110" REF="004633_0055_100DB2D8F8245080"/>
on them. I have also been more enlighten'd into the Knowledge of that Mystery of Godli∣ness, <HI>GOD manifest in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>;</HI> and saw more and more of GOD's Goodness in letting me have this Time of Retirement, to search out my Spirit. I would not but have come this Voyage for a Thousand Worlds: It has been sweet and profitable to my Soul: The Length and Conti∣nuance of it highly delights me. <HI>LORD, I want to kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w myself and thee. O let not the Hurry of Business which awaits me on shore, prevent my hearing the small still Voice of the Holy Spirit.

<P><HI>Sunday, October</HI> 14. Felt GOD's Power with us both at Sacrament and publick Worship, Morning and Evening Was enlarged in Inter∣cession, and had reason to believe there was a sweet Communion kept up between us and our Friends on shore.—The Thought of their Pray∣ers often li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts up my I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> when they hang down, and strengthens my feeble Knees: The Prospect of the many Changes and Trials which I must necessarily be exposed to undergo, sometimes fills me with Fear and Trembling; but when I reflect that GOD has stirred up the Hearts of his choicest Servants to pray for me, my Fears va∣nish: Methinks I could then leap into a burning fiery Furnace, or bear to be thrown into a Den of devouring Lions. <HI>LORD make me thus minded in the Hour of Trial! My dear Friends, continue to pray for me, that my Faith fail not.</HI></P>

<HI>Saturday, Oct.</HI> 20. On <HI>Tuesday</HI> and <HI>Wednesday</HI> had the roughest Weather we have yet met with, but the latter Part of the Week has been warm and calm. All our fresh live Stock of every kind is now gone, but thro' the Divine Bounty in raising us Friends, we have not only Food enough for ourselves, but some to spare to the Ship's Company. My being on board is every Day more and more comfortable. I experience fresh Teachings and Communications from GOD's holy Spirit, and have received some remarkable Answers to Prayer, both in respect to myself and Family. We are most of us l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sty as Eagles, and eat our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>read with Gladness and Singleness of Heart. The LORD is pleased to fill me out of his Divine Fulness, and to shew me more of the Glories of the Upper World. I can never be thankful enough for this sweet Retreat. How wonderfully does the great and in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>itely wise GOD cause every Thing to work together for our Good. I want a Thousand Tongues to praise him. <HI>Let every Thing that hath Breath praise the LORD.</HI></P>

GOD, I am quite resigned,—I like my Retire∣ment too well to be fond of leaving it, till the LORD obliges me. Our Provisions are grown pretty scanty; the People are put to an Allow∣ance of about half a Pound of Beef for each in a Day, and we have diminished our own Stock by helping them,—in this we rejoice,—How∣ever, blessed be GOD, we have got plenty of Water, and very fair Weather; and my Family I think was never in better Order in respect to their Bodies or Souls. The LORD has been especially gracious unto me, as he always is in Time of any Necessity: He has been pleased to give me great Freedom in Writing, and has vouchsafed me such plentiful Communications from himself, that I have abundant Reason to cry out, <HI>Surely GOD is in this Place.</HI></P>
<L><HI>Lo! GOD is here, my Soul adore,</HI></L>

<P><HI>Sunday, October</HI> 28. Felt more of the Divine Assistance to Day, than I have since I came on Board: I have been engaged in Writing my extempore Sermon on the <HI>Marriage of Cana,</HI>—The Holy Ghost brought many Things to my Remembrance; and tho' I have well drunk of Divine Comforts since my Retirement already, yet I may say, with the Governor of the Feast, <HI>LORD, thou hast kept the good Wine til now.

<P><HI>Tuesday, October</HI> 30. Had sweet Communion with GOD last Night. Prayed with, exhorted and solemnly recommended my Family to the Grace of our dear LORD JESUS, expecting to go on Shore. This Morning, being near <HI>Cape Hinlopen,</HI> a Pilot came on board, in whose Boat Brother <HI>Seward,</HI> myself, and another dear Friend, went to <HI>Lewes-Town,</HI> in Order that we might go to <HI>Philadelphia</HI> by Land, and get a House in Readiness before the Ship arrived in that Place.—Whilst in the Boat, I hope each of our Hearts was filled with a Sense of GOD's Love; and when we reached <HI>Lewes-Town,</HI> which was about Evening, I took the first Opportunity of retiring to vent my Heart in Praise and Thanksgiving, for his abundant Mercies conferr'd on me and mine.—Oh how can I be thankful enough for this blessed Voyage! I have been on board just Eleven Weeks, but they have seem'd to me only as so many Days;—My inner Man has been much better'd by it; my Knowledge, I trust, in spiritual Things increased; my Understanding
<PB N="114" REF="004633_0057_100DB2DD7A5F7370"/>
enlightned to see my Corruptions, and my Heart much enlarged in writing Letters and other Things. The Remembrance of my Humiliation is sweet unto my Soul; and the Freedom which GOD has given me over some darling Failings, fills me with Joy unspeakable and full of Glory. My Family also have great Reason to be thank∣ful: GOD has been pleased to work upon many of their Hearts, and I believe none of them repent Leaving their Native Country. A re∣markable Alteration is to be seen in two Friends Children, a Boy and a Girl, which I brought with me:—They are little more than 3 Years old, and can read in the Primer, and sing Part of <HI>Kenn'</HI>s Hymns very prettily; they have born the Voyage better than any in the Ship, and are under great Discipline; they are both generally employed either in Working or Reading, and are taught to make Work their Diversion; the little Boy picks Pease, and the little Girl sews with her Needle; the Proficiency they have made gives me great Satisfaction, and I hope is an Earnest of the Improvement that will be seen in the poor Children that are shortly to be com∣mitted to my Care. I cannot say any remarka∣ble Conversions have been wrought on board, but many have had strong Convictions. <HI>LORD, cause them to end in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Conversion.</HI> Amen.</P>
<P>But to return: About 5 in the Evening we landed at <HI>Lewes-Town,</HI> situated in the Southern Parts of the Province of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> and about 150 measured Miles from <HI>Philadelphia,</HI>—The Houses are most of them built of Wood; it is

Two or Three of the Head-Inhabitants being apprized who I was, came and spent the Evening with us, and desir'd me to give them a Sermon on the Morrow, which I promised to do. We s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pped very comfortably together, and after Singing and Praying with the Family, I and my dear Companions went to rest, admiring to see more and more of the Goodness and Providence of the all-wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e GOD. He is the great Housholder of the whole World; and I look upon all Places as so many little Parts of his great Family. I pray to him before I go; and I find, in Answer to my Prayers, he always commands some or other of his Houshold to take Care of, and provide for me. As here's the same Sun, so here's the same GOD in <HI>America</HI> as in <HI>England.</HI> I bless GOD all Places are equal to me, so I am where GOD would have me to be. I hope I never shall count my∣self a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> home, till I arrive at my heavenly Father's House above,—My Heart is there already,—I long to s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ake off this Earthly Tabernacle; it sadly confines my Soul: However, I desire patiently to tarry till my blessed Change cometh: I would not desire to <HI>reign</HI> till I had <HI>suffered</HI> with my Master:—Heaven will be doubly sweet when I am worn out with Distresses and Perse∣cutions for the Sake of JESUS CHRIST. <HI>LORD

<P><HI>Wednesday, October</HI> 31. Spent the Morning in Writing, and sent some Provisions on board for my Fellow-Travellers. Wrote some Letters, and preached in the Afternoon to a serious and attentive Congregation: Persons of different Denominations were present, and, as I heard afterwards were very much affected; some I observed to weep, and the Congregation was larger than might be expected in so small a Place, and after such short Notice. After Sermon, the High-Sheriff, Collector and Head Men of the Place, came and took an affectionate Leave of me: And by their Means being provided with Horses, and a Guide for our Journey, at a very reasonable Expence; about 5 in the Evening we left <HI>Lewes-Town,</HI> and rode very pleasantly near 27 Miles through the Woods; about 10 we stopped at what they call a Tavern, which was not very commodious, but the Host and Hostess were plain well-meaning People; they made us a Cake of unleavened Bread; let us have a little Cyder and a few Eggs, and we went to Bed rejoicing exceedingly. I know not that I have felt more Intenseness of Love, Peace and Joy in my Soul, since I left <HI>England.</HI> How does GOD

<P><HI>Thursday, November</HI> 1. Set out from our little Inn about 8. Dined at <HI>Dover,</HI> a little Town about 19 Miles distant from our Lodging. Left <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Books, and rode as pleasantly, and with as much Ease, as tho' we were Riding thro' <HI>Hyde-Park.</HI> About 8 we came to a more polite Inn, near 50 Miles distant from where we lay last Night. Our LORD was with us as we came on our Way; our Hearts burn'd within us whilst we talked to one another, in Psalms, and Hymns, and spiritual Songs. Oh how gloriously must the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> pass through the Wilderness, when they saw GOD's Presence go along with them. <HI>O LORD let it always ac∣company thy unworthy Servants, in as sure, tho' not visible Manner! for without it we can do nothing.</HI></P>

Visited the Proprietor, Commissary, and some others; was received very civilly, and perceived the Town was in great Expectation of seeing me. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with some gracious Souls, who discoursed with me sweetly concerning the Things which belong to the Kingdom of Heaven. Hired a House at a very cheap Rate, and was entirely set∣tled in it before 9 at Night. Methinks going thus from Place to Place, with my Friends, somewhat resembles the Patriarch <HI>Abraham'</HI>s frequent Re∣moves, when called to leave his Kindred and his native Country. <HI>Oh that, like him, we may erect an Altar for GOD, whithersoever we go!</HI> Bles∣sed be his holy Name, he hath sent his Angel before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to prepare our Way.

<HI>Sunday, November</HI> 4. Read Prayers and assisted at the Communion in the Morning: Dined with one of the Church-Wardens, and preached in the Afternoon to a large Congrega∣tion. Went in the Evening to the <HI>Quakers</HI> Meeting, and felt somewhat of a Sympathy with the Man that spoke; but I heartily wish they would talk of an outward, as well as inward CHRIST; for otherwise we make our Holiness, and not the Righteousness of JESUS CHRIST, the Cause of our being accepted by GOD. <HI>From such Doctrine may I always turn away.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, November</HI> 5. Read Prayers and Preach'd to a large Auditory. Din'd with the other Church-Warden; and had some close and edifying Conversation, about our Justification by Faith in JESUS CHRIST.—Was visited in the Afternoon by the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Minister. Went afterwards to see the <HI>Baptist</HI> Teacher, who seems to be a Spiritual Man: And spent part of the Evening most agreeably with two loving <HI>Quakers.</HI> Had remarkable Instances of GOD's answering our Prayers, which we put up on board Ship, in the minutest Manner. <HI>O that I may watch GOD's particular Providence more and more!</HI> It comforts and builds up my Soul How unhappy mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> they be who would exclude it out of the World!

<HI>Tuesday, November</HI> 6. Read Prayers and Preached in the Morning; having the Use of the Pulpit granted me for the whole Week. Went, at the Invitation of its Father, to the Funeral of a <HI>Quaker'</HI>s Child; and thought it my Duty, as there was a great Concourse of People at the Burying Place, and no one of the <HI>Quakers</HI> spoke, to give a Word of Exhortation. I hope this will be a Means of making them more free in coming to hear the Word, tho' preached within a Church Wall. <HI>Oh that Bigotry and Prejudice were ba∣nished out of the Christian World! LORD, if it be thy Will, let it not be once named among us, as be∣cometh Saints. Amen, LORD</HI> JESUS, <HI>Amen!</HI></P>
<P>Was visited again in the Evening, by the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> &amp; <HI>Baptist</HI> Ministers, who were much rejoiced to hear JESUS CHRIST preached in the Church. Whilst I was conversing with them, some Women came, desiring they might be ad∣mitted to Evening Prayers with my Family: I looked on this as a Hint from Providence; called them up, and found much Enlargement of Heart in exhorting them, and pouring out my Heart be∣fore GOD in their Behalf. Many came up af∣terwards, whom I desired, if they thought proper, to come again every Night. Who knows but the LORD may be about to open a yet more effectual Door? <HI>O prepare me to do thy Will, O GOD!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wednesday, November</HI> 7. Read Prayers and preached in the Church. Din'd with Mr. <HI>Penn</HI> the Proprietor; and prayed with, and gave a Word of Exhortation to more than a Roomfull

of People, who came as last Night, to hear the Gospel of CHRIST. Blessed be GOD, I found much Freedom of Spirit; but having taken Cold, was obliged to leave off sooner than otherwise I should have done: However, in the midst of the Weakness and Purging of my Body, the Thoughts of seeing People come so gladly to hear the Word, refresh'd and comforted my Soul. <HI>LORD make it my only Joy to see thy Kingdom advanced and carried on.</HI> Amen <HI>and</HI> Amen.</P>
<P><HI>Thursday, November</HI> 8. Read Prayers and Preach'd, rather to a more numerous Congrega∣tion than I have seen yet. Dined with an ho∣nest, open-hearted, true <HI>Israelitish Quaker.</HI> Had a sweet Opportunity with him and his Family, of talking about JESUS CHRIST, and him cruci∣fied: And preached from the Court-House Stai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, to about 6000 People, at Six in the Evening Blessed be GOD, I find, the Number that came <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n <HI>Tuesday</HI> to my House, greatly increas'd and multiplied. The Inhabitants were very sollici∣tous for my Preaching in another Place beside the Church: For it is quite contrary here, to what it is in <HI>England:</HI> There the generality of People think a Sermon cannot be preached well <HI>without,</HI> here they do not like it so well, if deliver'd <HI>with∣in</HI> the Church Walls. <HI>LORD, grant I may be∣come all Things, to all Men; and preach the Gos∣pel in every Place, and in any Manner, as well as to every Creature; that by all Means I may save some!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, November</HI> 9. Read Prayers and Preached as usual in the Morning, and perceived
<PB N="122" REF="004633_0061_100DB2E80982FF60"/>
the Congregation still encreased. Visited a sick Person, to whom I was sent for, and perceived the Power of the LORD was present, both with the sick Person and those that attended around the Bed. Most wept sorely at the Preaching of Faith. Was visited in a kind Manner by the Minister of the Parish: And preached again at Six in the Evening, from the Court-House Steps. I believe there were near 2000 more present to Night than last Night. Even in <HI>London,</HI> I never observ'd so profound a Silence before my Coming. All was exceeding hush'd &amp; quiet. The Night was clear, but not Cold. Lights were in most of the Windows all around us, for a considerable distance. The People did not seem weary of standing, nor was I weary of speaking. The LORD endued me with Power from on high. My Heart was enlarged and warmed with divine Love. My Soul was carried out in Prayer, that I thought I could have continued my Discourse all Night. After I came home, some desired to join in Family Pra∣yers; and in that Exercise the divine Presence was manifest amongst us. <HI>Surely God has a Favour unto this People!</HI> At present they seem most gladly to receive, and sweetly to melt un∣der the Word. <HI>LORD, I beseech thee, manifest forth thy Glory more and more: And grant that much People in this City may be enabled to believe on thee! Even so LORD</HI> JESUS. Amen <HI>and</HI> Amen.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday, November</HI> 10. Before it was light, came a young Person whom I observ'd to be much affected last Night, desiring to join in Prayer; and
<PB N="123" REF="004633_0061_100DB2E80982FF60"/>
after our Devotions were ended, she put into my Hand the following Letter.</P>
<P><Q>Oh! what shall I say to express my Thanks I owe to my good GOD, in and from you, thro' JESUS CHRIST; which you have been the happy Instrument of beginning in my Soul: And if you have any Regard to a poor, miserable, blind and naked Wretch, that's not only Dust, but Sin, as I am confident you have, you will in no wise reject my humble Request; which is, that I, even I who am the most unworthy, may lay hold on this blessed Opportunity of forsaking all, in order to persevere in a virtuous Course of Life: Despise not thou thine Hand-Maiden; but O let me say, as <HI>Ruth</HI> the <HI>Moabitess</HI> said to her Mother-in-Law, <HI>Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee; for whither thou goest I will go, and whither thou art there will I be also; thy People shall be my People, and thy GOD my GOD.</HI> Thus am I fully determined. I pray and beg that you would not despise thy poor, forlorn and destitute Fellow-Creature; and the LORD recompence thy Work, and a full Reward be given unto thee of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, under whose Wings I am come to trust.</Q></P>
<P>Soon after came a little Maid, about 7 Years of Age, telling me, she heard I took little Children to <HI>Georgia,</HI> and desired me to take her. In the remaining Part of the Morning several gracious Souls of different Communions, paid me a most loving Visit, and my Heart was much refresh'd with their pious Conversation. About 11 I read
<PB N="124" REF="004633_0062_100DB2EA63FF4948"/>
Prayers and preached in the Church, to a larger Audience than before. Din'd with the Minister of the Parish; and at my Return Home, was much comforted by the Coming of one Mr. <HI>Tennent,</HI> an old, grey-headed Disciple and Soldier of JESUS CHRIST. He keeps an Academy about 20 Miles off <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and has been bless'd with <HI>four</HI> gracious Sons, <HI>three</HI> of which have been, and still continue, to be eminently useful in the Church of CHRIST:—He brought three pious Souls along with him, and rejoiced me, by letting me know how they had been evil spoken of for their Master's sake:—He is a great Friend to Mr. <HI>Erskine</HI> of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and as far as I can find, both he and his Sons are secretly despised here, by the Generality of the Synod, as Mr. <HI>Erskine</HI> and his Brethren are hated by the Judi∣catories of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and as the Methodist Preachers (as they are called) are by their Bre∣thren in <HI>England.</HI> Tho' we are but few, and stand, as it were, alone, like <HI>Elijah;</HI> and they, like the Priests of <HI>Baal,</HI> are many in Number; yet I doubt not but the LORD will appear for us, as he did for that Prophet, and make us more than Conquerors over all.</P>
<P>About 3 went to the Prison, and preached on the <HI>Trembling Jailor.</HI>—The Place was crouded, and many wept. Return'd home with the <HI>Swedish</HI> Minister and old Mr. <HI>Tennent.</HI> Conversed of the Things of GOD for a considerable Time; then preached in the Evening to as large a Con∣gregation as there was last Night, from the Court-House Stairs. <HI>Satan</HI> endeavoured to
<PB N="125" REF="004633_0062_100DB2EA63FF4948"/>
interrupt us about the Middle of the Discourse; for the People were frightned with they knew not what, but they were soon at Peace. I preached above an Hour; and when I had finished, the People seemed unwilling to go away, so I began to pray afresh, and I hope the LORD sent them Home with his Blessing. Many to my Know∣ledge, have been already quicken'd, and awaken'd to see that Religion does not consist in outward Things, but Righteousness, Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghost. <HI>Oh that they may not only receive the Word with Joy for a Season, but bring forth Fruit unto Perfection!</HI></P>
<P>After Preaching, my House was filled with People, who came in to join in Psalms and Fa∣mily Prayer: My Body was somewhat weak, but the LORD strengthen'd and enlarged my Heart. Many wept most bitterly whilst I was praying; their Hearts, I believe, were loaded with a Sense of Sin, the only Preparative for the Soul-refresh∣ing Visitations of JESUS CHRIST. Blessed be the LORD for sending me hither: This has been a Day of fat Things. <HI>LORD, give me Humility, and make me truly thankful.</HI> Amen, <HI>LORD</HI> JESUS.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday, November</HI> 10. Read Prayers in the Morning. Dined with the Collector. Preached in the Afternoon to a very thronged Congrega∣tion. Visited one sick Person; and administred the holy Sacrament to another, who has received no such Peace and inward Comfort for these 12 Years, as GOD has been pleased to communicate to her Soul at this Time. <HI>Not unto me, O Lord,

not unto me, but unto thy Name be all the Glory.</HI> For ever adored be the Divine Goodness, the Gospel has taken Root in many Hearts. As soon as I come Home, my House is generally filled with People, desirous to join in Psalms and Prayers; they are so eager after the Bread of Life, that they scarce can give me Time to take bodily Refreshment, and proper Retirement in my Closet: GOD, I am persuaded, has a Favour unto them. My Power and Freedom of Speech encreases daily, and this Afternoon I was carried out much, in Bearing my Testimony against the Unchristian Principles and Practices of the Gene∣rality of our Clergy. Three of my Reverend Brethren were present; I know not whether they were offended; I endeavoured to speak with Meekness as well as Zeal; and I find the Necessity more and more, of Discovering those that are only Wolves in Sheep's Cloathing. Was I to convert <HI>Papists,</HI> my Business would be to shew they were misguided by the Priests; and if I want to convince <HI>Church of England Protestants,</HI> I must prove, that the Generality of their Teachers do not preach or live the Truth as it is in JESUS: For in vain we hope to set People right, till we demonstrate, that the Way they have been taught, is wrong Perhaps this may cost me my Life; but what have I to do with that?</P>

I never yet knew one truly awaken'd, who did not quickly commence a Fool for CHRIST'S sake. Was pleased to see several tender Souls come to Family Prayer.

Tennent,</HI> an eminent Dissenting Minister, about 40 Years of Age, Son to that good old Man who came to see me on <HI>Saturday</HI> at <HI>Philadelphia.</HI> GOD, I find, has been pleased greatly to own his Labours: He and his Associates are now the burning and shining Lights of this Part of <HI>Ame∣rica.</HI> He recounted to me many remarkable Effusions of the Blessed Spirit which have been sent down amongst them; and one may judge of their being true and faithful Soldiers of JESUS CHRIST, because they are every where spoken evil of by natural Men. The Devil and carnal secure Ministers rage horribly against them. Several pious Souls came to see me at his House, with whom I took sweet Counsel. At their Request, and finding there was a general Expec∣tation of hearing me, I read the Church Liturgy and preached in the Evening, at Mr. <HI>Tennent'</HI>s Meeting-house; for there is no Place set apart for the Worship of the <HI>Church of England;</HI> and it is common for Dissenters and Conformists to worship at the same Place. <HI>Oh! that the Par∣tition-Wall was broken down, that we all with one Heart and one Mind, might glorify the Lord</HI> JESUS CHRIST!

<P><HI>Wednesday, November</HI> 14. Set out early from <HI>Brunswick,</HI> in Company with my dear Fellow-Travellers, and r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y worthy Brother and Fellow-Labourer Mr. <HI>Tennent.</HI> As we passed along, we spent our Time most agreeably in telling one another what GOD had done for our Souls. He recounted to me many sweet Instances of GOD's striving with his Heart, and how Grace at last overcame all his Fightings against GOD. About Noon we got to <HI>Elizabeth-Town,</HI> 22 Miles from <HI>Brunswick.</HI> Here we took Boat, and about 4 reached <HI>New-York,</HI> where we were most affectionately received by the Family of Mr. <HI>Noble.</HI> As soon as we had refreshed our Bodies by Eating a little Food, and our Souls by giving of Thanks, I waited upon Mr. <HI>Vesey,</HI> the Commissary, but he was not at Home; then I went to the Meeting-House, to hear Mr. <HI>Gilbert Tennent</HI> preach, and never before heard such a searching Sermon; he went to the Bottom in∣deed, and did not daub with untemper'd Mortar: He convinc'd me more and more, that we can preach the Gospel of CHRIST no farther than we have experienced the Power of it in our own Hearts. Being deeply convicted of Sin, and driven from time to time off his false Bottom and Dependencies, by GOD's holy▪ Spirit, at his first Conversion, he has learned experimentally to dissect the Heart of a natural Man.—Hypo∣crites must either soon be converted or enraged at his Preaching:—He is a <HI>Son of Thunder,</HI> and
<PB N="131" REF="004633_0065_100DB2F0AF282C90"/>
does not regard the Face of Man:—He is deeply sensible of the Deadness and Formality of the Christian Church in these Parts, and has given noble Testimonies against it. After Sermon we spent the Evening together at Mr. <HI>Noble'</HI>s House; at their Request, I expounded and prayed, and after we had sung a Psalm, we took our Leaves of each other, and went to rest. My Soul was humbled and melted down with a Sense of GOD's Mercies; and I found more and more, what a Babe and Novice I was in the Things of GOD. <HI>Blessed</HI> JESUS, <HI>grant I may make conti∣nual Advances, till I come to a perfect Man in Thee!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thursday, Nov.</HI> 15. Had several come to see me at my Lodgings, who also gave me kind Invitations to their Houses. Waited upon Mr. <HI>Vesey;</HI> but could wish for his own Sake, he had behaved in a more Christian Manner. He seem'd to be full of Anger and Resentment; and before I asked him the Use of the Pulpit, denied it. He desired to see my Letters of Orders. I told him they were left at <HI>Philadelphia.</HI> He asked me for my License: I told him, I never heard that my Lord of <HI>London,</HI> as yet, gave any License to any one that went to preach the Gospel in <HI>Georgia;</HI> but that I was presented to the Living of <HI>Savannah</HI> by the Trustees; and upon that Presentation had Letters dimissory from my Lord of <HI>London,</HI> which I thought was Authority sufficient. But this was by no Means satisfactory. He charged me with Breaking my Oath, for Breaking the Canons, which enjoins Ministers
<PB N="132" REF="004633_0066_100DB2F4038181B8"/>
and Church-Wardens not to admit Persons into their Pulpits without a License. Alas! how can I break that, when I am neither a Church-Warden, nor have any Church hereabouts to admit any one into? Upon this, hearing he was a Frequenter of Publick Houses, I reminded him of that Canon which forbids the Clergy to go into any such Places.—This, tho' spoke in the Spirit of Meekness, stirred up his Corruptions more and more. He charged me with making a Disturbance at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and sowing and causing Divisions in other Places; <HI>But,</HI> says he, with a Sneer, <HI>you have a Necessity laid upon you to preach.</HI> I told him, I had; for the Clergy and Laity of our Church seem'd to be settled on their Lees; but my End was not to sow Divisions, but to propagate the pure Gospel of JESUS CHRIST. He said, <HI>they did not want</HI> my <HI>Assistance.</HI> I replied, if they did preach the Gospel, I wished them good Luck in the Name of the LORD; but as he had denied me the Church without my asking for the Use of it, I would preach in the Fields, for all Places were alike to me. <HI>Yes,</HI> says he, <HI>I find you have been used to that.</HI> After that, he taxed me with Censuring my Superiors. I told him, I was no Respecter of Persons; if a Bishop committed a Fault, I would tell him of it; if a common Clergyman did not act aright, I would be free with him also, as well as with a Lay man,—Whilst we were talking he called for some Wine, and I drank his Health. Soon after he rose up; said he had Business to do; and, as we were
<PB N="133" REF="004633_0066_100DB2F4038181B8"/>
going out, full of Resentment he said to Mr. <HI>Noble,</HI> who accompanied me and Brother <HI>Seward, Mr.</HI> Noble, <HI>as you have sent for this Gentleman, so I desire you will find him a Pulpit.</HI> Alas! alas! what Manner of Spirit are the Generality of the Clergy possess'd with? Is this the Spirit of the meek Lamb of GOD? Are these the Fruits of the Holy Ghost, which they pretended to be moved with, when they took Holy Orders? It cannot be. Surely the Kingdom of GOD will be taken from them: The Curse which fell on <HI>Eli'</HI>s Sons, I fear, will light on them: They cause the Sacrifice of GOD to be abhorred: Their Bigotry, if it was nothing else, in Time would destroy them. <HI>LORD! for thy Mercies sake, lighten their Darkness; and grant that some of the Priests also may be obedient to the Truth.</HI></P>
<P>Din'd with Mr. <HI>Pemberton,</HI> the Presbyterian Minister. Preached in the Fields to upwards of 2000, as Three in the Afternoon, and ex∣pounded at Six in the Evening to a very thronged and attentive Audience at Mr. <HI>Pemberton'</HI>s Meet∣ing-House. At first for the sake of my weak Brethren, I was unwilling to Preach there; but hearing that Mr. <HI>Vesey,</HI> the Commissary himself, had preach'd in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Calvinistical Meeting-House, when there was no Place of Worship for the People of our own Community; and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Meeting-House being denied me, as well as the Church, I thought it my Duty to accept of the kind Offer made me by Mr. <HI>Pemberton</HI> and his Friends. In the Field, some few Mock'd; but GOD gave me Power to speak to them, and
<PB N="134" REF="004633_0067_100DB2F6A843D4B0"/>
they grew more serious. At Night, the People seem'd exceedingly attentive; and I have not felt greater Freedom in Preaching, and more Power in Prayer, and a stronger Indwelling of the Spirit, since I came into <HI>America,</HI> than I have at <HI>New-York.</HI> I find it has been a secure Place, and but little of the Work of GOD seen in it for many Years. <HI>Oh that this may be the accepted Time! LORD, let this be the Day of their Salvation!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, November</HI> 16. Preached at Three in the Afternoon, to a lovely Congregation, in the Meeting-House, it being too cool to go into the Fields.—Expounded again in the Evening at the same Place to a far greater Congregation than I have seen yet. Great Multitudes returned home for want of Room. GOD enabled me to Preach with Power; and I hope some Good will be done here, because Satan is disturbed. After Evening Service, I was told by several Persons, that the Constables of the Town had been placed at the Door of the <HI>English</HI> Church, lest my Ad∣herents, encouraged by me, should break it open and take it by Force. Well may the Heads of our Church People be said to reject the Kingdom of GOD against themselves. I fear GOD will shortly take it from them. They imitate the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Pharisees</HI> in their Crimes: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fear they will be made Partakers of their Punish∣ments. <HI>Oh that they would see in this their Day the Things that belong to their Peace!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, November</HI> 17. Preached as usual in the Afternoon at the Meeting-House to a pretty
<PB N="135" REF="004633_0067_100DB2F6A843D4B0"/>
Congregation: And again at Night, to a great Multitude, standing round the Doors, beside those that were within. <HI>Wo be to those, who by their Bigotry, Prejudice and Party Zeal, oblige us to Preach the Gospel in so confined a Place:</HI> But no Matter; this as well as every Thing else shall be over-ruled for the good of CHRIST'S Church.—Had the Pleasure of Hearing that some blessed Effects had been produced by the Preaching of the Word; and several expressed a strong Inclina∣tion to go with me. When GOD will work, who can hinder? <HI>Praised be the LORD, who daily shews me this is the Way wherein I should go. LORD, make me humble and thankful!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, November</HI> 18. Preached this Morn∣ing by Eight a Clock, unto a very attentive Au∣ditory. Went to the <HI>English</HI> Church, both Morning and Evening, and felt my Heart al∣most bleed within me, to consider what blind Guides were sent forth into her. If I have any Regard for the Honour of CHRIST, and the good of Souls, I must lift up my Voice like a Trum∣pet, and shew how sadly our Church Ministers are fallen from the Doctrines of the Reformati∣on. Her Prophets prophesy Lies, and I fear many of the People love to have it so. <HI>It is high Time, O LORD, that thou have Mercy upon</HI> Sion. <HI>Oh let that Time shortly come!</HI></P>
<P>In the second Lesson in the Morning, were these Verses, and some I found made an imme∣diate Application of them, by looking on me. <HI>John,</HI> Chap. X. Ver. 19, 20, 21. <HI>There was a Division therefore again among the</HI> Jews, <HI>for
<PB N="136" REF="004633_0068_100DB2F8F504CCB8"/>
these Sayings. And many of them said, he hath a Devil, and is mad; why hear ye him? Others said, these are not the Words of him that hath a Devil.</HI> In the Evening vast Numbers flocked to hear the Word. Some petitioned the Mayor to have the use of the Town-Hall; but it was denied: Then we thought of expounding out of a Window, and to let the People stand in the Street; but at last, with much Difficulty, I got into the Meeting-House; and the People being prevailed on to open the Windows, Numbers could hear that stood on the outside. GOD was pleased to enlarge my Heart, and I was pressed in Spirit to bear my Testimony against the Doctrines deliver'd in the <HI>English</HI> Church, both Morning and Evening. Tho' it may seem a hard Saying to many, yet our People have need to be caution'd against the Generality of the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Pharisees</HI> of our Communion, as much as the <HI>Jews</HI> were cautioned to beware of the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Pharisees,</HI> by our dear LORD JESUS. After Sermon, many People came to pray with me, and take a last Farewel. They also gave me Tokens of Love, and I had great Reason to believe GOD has begun a good Work in <HI>New-York.</HI> I have not felt such Freedom and Sweetness of Soul since I have been in <HI>America;</HI> one Reason I believe is, because I have been here uncommonly opposed. Saw my Sermon on Re∣generation advertised in the <HI>New-England</HI> Paper. Gave leave for my Answer to my Lord of <HI>London</HI> to be printed at <HI>New-York.</HI></P>
<P>About Ten at Night, having spent some time
<PB N="137" REF="004633_0068_100DB2F8F504CCB8"/>
in Prayer, I took Boat with my Friends, and had a pleasant Passage to a Place about Half∣way to <HI>Elizabeth-Town,</HI> where we lay down with Joy and Thankfulness for the great Things the LORD had shewn us. <HI>Oh that I was duly sensible of his distinguishing Mercies!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, November</HI> 19. Took Boat about Five in the Morning, and reached <HI>Elizabeth-Town</HI> about Seven. Spent the Morning in writing Letters and Journal, and in Religious Conversation with dear Mr. <HI>Tennent,</HI> Mr. <HI>Noble,</HI> and other Friends, who accompanied me. Paid a Visit to Mr. <HI>Vaugh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> the Minister of the Church of <HI>England</HI> in <HI>Elizabeth-Town;</HI> who, as I afterwards heard, had preached against me, and said, I should not have the Use of his Pulpit. Din'd with Mr. <HI>Dickinson</HI> the Dissenting Minister, who had sent a Letter of Invitation to <HI>New-York,</HI> and offer'd me the Use of his Meeting-House; About Twelve I preach'd in it according to Ap∣pointment, to upwards of 700 People, many of which seemed much affected; and GOD was pleased to open my Mouth against both Ministers and People among the Dissenters, who hold the Truth in Unrighteousness, contenting themselves with a bare speculative Knowledge of the Doc∣trines of Grace, but never experienced the Power of them in their Hearts. <HI>These shall re∣ceive the greater Condemnation.</HI></P>

in worthy Mr. <HI>Tennent'</HI>s Meeting-House, to a large Assembly gather'd together from all Parts; and amongst them, as Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> told me, there was a great Body of solid Christians. About Three in the Afternoon I preach'd again; and at seven▪ Baptized two Children; and preach'd a third Time, with greater Freedom than at either of the former Opportunities. It is impossible to tell with what Pleasure the Children of GOD heard these Truths confirm'd by a Minister of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> which for many Years have been preach'd to them by their own Pastor Mr. <HI>Ten∣nent.</HI> Opposers Mouths were stop'd; several were brought under strong Convictions; and our LORD'S dear Disciples were ready to leap for Joy. To me, the Meeting seemed to be like the Meeting of the twelve Tribes, when they came from dif∣ferent Parts to Worship the LORD at <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> Among others that came to hear the Word, were several Ministers, whom the LORD has been pleased to honour, in making them Instruments of bringing many Sons to Glory. The one was a <HI>Dutch</HI> Calvinistical Minister, named <HI>Freeling∣hausen,</HI> Pastor of a Congregation about four Miles off <HI>New-Brunswick:</HI> He is a worthy old Soldier of JESUS CHRIST, and was a Beginner of the great Work, which I trust the LORD is carrying on in these Parts. He has been strongly opposed by his carnal Brethren; but GOD has always appeared for him in a surprizing Manner, and made him more than Conqueror over all. thro' his Love: He has long since learned to Fear him only, who can destroy both Body and
<PB N="139" REF="004633_0069_100DB2FAD2647348"/>
Soul in Hell. Another was one Mr. <HI>Cross,</HI> Mi∣nister of a Congregation at <HI>Baskinridge,</HI> about 20 Miles from <HI>Brunswick:</HI> A most remarkable Outpouring of the Spirit has been frequently seen in his Congregation, for which he has been much opposed by natural Men: He himself told me of many wonderful Effects, and sudden Conversions that had been wrought by the LORD under his Ministry. For some time eight or nine used to come to him together in deep Distress of Soul; and I think he said, two Hundred of his Con∣gregation, which is not very large, were effec∣tually brought home to CHRIST: But tho' they are the excellent Ones of the Earth, they are looked upon as Enthusiasts and Madmen, and treated as such by those that know not GOD, and are ignorant of the hidden Life of JESUS CHRIST in their Hearts: He indeed is one, who, I believe would rejoice to suffer for the LORD JESUS. <HI>Oh that I may be like minded!</HI> A third Minister was one Mr. <HI>Camphel,</HI> who has been a Preacher of the Doctrines of Grace for these four Years; was a regular moral Liver, and accounted a very good Man; but within these few Months, being convinced of Sin, and that he knew nothing experimentally of JESUS CHRIST, tho' he had pretended to preach him so long; after many Struggles with himself, he told the Presbytery he was unconverted, and therefore durst not preach till he was converted: Accordingly he has le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t off Preaching these two Months, and h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s laboured under unspeakable Anguish and Distress of Soul. By some he is
<PB N="140" REF="004633_0070_100DB2FD1172ACC0"/>
looked upon as melancholy, and besides him∣self; but I had much Discourse with him, and really believe these Humiliations will pre∣pare him for great and eminent Services in the Church of GOD.—His Case puts me in mind of Professor <HI>Frank,</HI> who being on <HI>Easter-Day</HI> to preach on the Nature of Divine Faith, and find∣ing he had not that Faith himself, was convicted by GOD of his unregenerate State, upon which he ran into the Woods, was there deeply humbled, and at last became a most exalted Instance of Faith. At our Persuasion, Mr. <HI>Campbell</HI> promised to preach next <HI>Sunday▪</HI> and, I believe, will be instrumental of convicting many Heart-Hypocrites among the Dissenting Ministers: For that there are such, is evident from this; tho' they have been bred up in, and preach the Doc∣trines of Grace, yet whenever the Power of GOD appears in any Congregation, they cry it down, as much as our Ministers of the Church of <HI>England. Oh that the LORD may Comfort poor Mr.</HI> Campbell, <HI>and cause him to detect these Wolves in Sheep's Cloathing!</HI> With these Mini∣sters, and many other Disciples of our dear LORD JESUS, I took sweet Counsel. We eat our Bread with Gladness and Singleness of Heart; and comforted ourselves with this Consideration, that, tho' we must be separated from each other on this Earth, yet we should sit down to eat Bread with <HI>Abraham, Isaac</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> in the Kingdom of Heaven. <HI>Hasten, O LORD, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> blessed Time▪ Oh when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thy Kingdom come!</HI></P>

<PB N="143" REF="004633_0071_100DB2FEC3795010"/>
gave a Word of Exhortation, to confirm what had been delivered. At the End of his Discourse we sung a Psalm, and then dismissed the People with a Blessing. <HI>Oh that the LORD may say</HI> Amen <HI>to it!</HI> After our Exercises were over, we went to old Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI>'s, who entertain'd us like one of the antient Patriarchs: His Wife to me seemed like <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and he like <HI>Zachary;</HI> both, as far as I can find, walk in all the Ordinances and Commandments of the LORD, blameless. Tho' GOD was pleased to humble my Soul, so that I was obliged to retire for a while; yet we had sweet Communion with each other, and spent the Evening in Concerting what Measures had best be taken, for Promoting our dear LORD's Kingdom. It happened very providentially, that Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> and his Brethren, are appointed to be a Presbytery, by the Synod; so that they intend Breeding up gracious Youths, and sending them out, from time to time, into our LORD's Vineyard.—The Place wherein the young Men study now, is, in Contempt, called, <HI>The College:</HI> It is a Log-House, about 20 Foot long, and near as many broad; and to me it seem'd to resemble the School of the old Pro∣phets; for that their Habitations were mean, and that they sought not great Things for them∣selves, is plain from those Passages of Scripture wherein we are told, that <HI>each of them took a Beam to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them a House,</HI> and that at the Feast of the Sons of the Prophets, <HI>one of them put on the Pot. Whilst the others went to fetch some Herbs <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Field.</HI> And that can be said of most
<PB N="144" REF="004633_0072_100DB30108924A48"/>
of our publick Universities, is, they are glorious without. From this despised Place, 7 or 8 worthy Ministers of JESUS have lately been sent forth; more are almost ready to be sent; and a Foundation is now Laying for the Instruction of many others. The Devil will certainly rage against them; but the Work I am persuaded is of GOD, and therefore will not come to nought. Carnal Ministers oppose them strongly; and because People, when awakened by Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> or his Brethren, see through, and therefore leave their Ministry; the poor Gentlemen are loaded with Contempt, and looked upon (as all faithful Preachers will be) as Persons that turn the World upside down. A notable War, I trust, is Commencing between <HI>Michael</HI> and the Dragon. We may easily guess who will prevail. <HI>The Seed of the Woman shall bruise the Serpent's Head.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Friday, November</HI> 23. Parted with dear Mr. <HI>Tennent,</HI> and his other worthy fellow Labou∣rer; but promised to remember each other publickly in our Prayers. Rode to <HI>Abington,</HI> about 10 Miles from <HI>Neshaminy,</HI> and preach'd to above 2000 People, from a Porch Window belonging to the Meeting-House, whither I was invited yesterday, after I had preached at <HI>Nesha∣miny.</HI> Many of the People seem'd affected, and I think I have not seen greater Things, no not in <HI>England.</HI> It is surprizing how such vast Bodies of People, so scattered abroad, can be gathered at so short a Warning.—I believe at
<PB N="145" REF="004633_0072_100DB30108924A48"/>
<HI>Neshaminy</HI> there might be about 1000 Horses, which the People do not sit on to hear the Ser∣mon as at <HI>England,</HI> but tie them to the Hedges, and thereby much Disorder is prevented. As soon as I had done, fresh Invitations were made me, to come to several Places, would Time and Business permit. Tho' it was Cold, the People stood very patiently in the open Air, and seemed in no Hurry to return home after the Discourses were ended. <HI>What are outward Things to a Soul intent on GOD? less than nothing.</HI></P>
<P>As soon as I had finished, I hasten'd to <HI>Phi∣ladelphia;</HI> and blessed be GOD, found my Fa∣mily in good order, and all Things carried on according to my Desire. <HI>Oh how can I express my Thankfulness for this little Every Son!</HI> The LORD has done great Things for us in it; whereat the People of GOD are much rejoiced. <HI>Oh that I may now begin to do something for</HI> CHRIST! <HI>not to justify my Person, but my Faith, and to shew my Love and Gratitude for what GOD has done for my Soul!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, November</HI> 24. Preach'd this Morn∣ing in the Church, with much Freedom and Power.—Several came to me, enquiring about inward Feelings, and the receiving the Holy Ghost; and I found many began to be awakened out of their carnal Security, by the Word preach'd. Received an excellent Letter from one grievously vexed with Temptations, whom GOD has been pleased to make me an Instru∣ment of Comforting. Preached again at four in the Afternoon, in the Church, that being judged

more convenient than the Market Place, as the Weather was so cold. A vast Concourse of all Denominations were present. GOD gave me, particularly towards the close of my Sermon, to speak with divine Energy.—After Sermon, I visited two sick Persons. Supped comfortably with my Family; and laid me down, with a strong Desire to see my own Unworthiness, and the Freeness and Riches of that Grace, which alone has made me to differ from the most abandon'd of Men. Whatever others may see in themselves I know not; this one Thing I know, I see nothing but Hell in my Soul. <HI>And therefore, whenever I do glory, I desire only to glory in thee O LORD!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, November</HI> 25. Had great Travail of Soul, and Struggle within myself, about a Text to preach on; and could not conceive the reason of such uncommon Perplexity. At last I fix'd on one for the Morning; and trusted to GOD to direct me to one for the Evening: But before I came from Church, GOD shewed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne what I should do; for after I had done Preaching, a young Gentleman, once a Minister of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> but now a Secretary to Mr. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> stood up with a loud Voice, and wanted the People against the Doctrine I had been delivering; urging, <HI>that there was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as imputed Righteousness in holy Scripture; that such Doctrine puts a Stop to all Goodness; that we were to be judged for our good Works and Obedience, and were commended to Do and Live.</HI> When he had ended, I denied his first Proposi∣tion,

<PB N="147" REF="004633_0073_100DB30446D730B0"/>
and brought a Text to prove an imputed Righteousness was a scriptural Expression. But thinking the Church an improper Place for Dis∣putation, I said no more at that Time. The Portion of Scripture appointed for the Epistle was, <HI>Jer.</HI> xxiii. wherein were these Words, <HI>THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.</HI> Upon these I discoursed in the Afternoon. I shewed how the LORD JESUS was to be our whole Righteousness; proved how the contrary Doctrine overthrowed all Divine Revelation; answered all Objections, that were made against an imputed Righteousness; produced the Articles of our Church to illustrate it; and concluded with an Exhortation to all, to lay aside a Rea∣soning Infidelity, and to submit to JESUS CHRIST, who is the End of the Law for Righteousness, to every one that believeth. The Verses at the beginning of the Chapter, out of which the Text was taken, were very remarkable. <HI>Jer.</HI> Chap. XXIII. <HI>Ver.</HI> 1,2,3,4. <HI>Wo be unto the Pastors th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> destroy and scatter the Sheep of my Pasture, saith the LORD. Therefore thus saith the Lord God of</HI> Israel <HI>against the Pastors that feed my People, Ye have scattered my Flock, and driven th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> away, and have not visited them; Behold, I will visit upon you the Evil of your Doings, saith the LORD. And I will gather the Remnant of my Flock, out of all Countries whither I have driven them, and will bring them again to their Folds, and they shall be fruitful and increase. And I will set up Shepherds over them, which shall feed them, and they shall fear no more, nor be dis∣mayed;
<PB N="148" REF="004633_0074_100DB3070704F770"/>
neither shall they be lacking, saith the LORD.</HI> GOD was pleased to fulfil the Pro∣mise in me, for, blessed be his Name, I was not dismayed. The Word came with Power. The Church was thronged within and without, and all wonderfully attentive; and many, as I am inform'd convinced that the LORD CHRIST was our Righteousness.—In the Evening the Gentleman came to me; but alas! was so very dark in all the Fundamentals of Christianity; and such an entire Stranger to Inward Feelings, that I was obliged to say to him, <HI>Art thou a Master of</HI> Israel <HI>and knowest not these Things? LORD, convict and convert him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thy infinite Mercies sake!</HI></P>
<P>Went to the <HI>Quakers</HI> Meeting, for a little Time. Gave the Sacrament a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a private House; and came home, exhorted, prayed and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ung Psalms with a Roomfull of People.—They fol∣low me wherever I go, as they used to do in <HI>London;</HI> and I believe a noble Gathering of Souls might be in this Place▪ H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re, as else∣where, they only went Somebody to preach the Truth as it is in JESUS. <HI>Dearest LORD, remem∣ber thy Church, and revive thy Work amongst them, in the midst of thy Years!</HI></P>

About four in the Afternoon we went in Company with many dear Disciples of the LORD to see one <HI>Conrad Matthews,</HI> an aged Hermit, who has lived a solitary Life near 40 Years; he was an Heir to a great Estate, but chose a voluntary Poverty; he has worked hard, but would always work without Wages; he is now unable to do much, but GOD sends Some∣body or another to feed him: A Friend built him the little House wherein he lives, and JESUS, I am persuaded, dwells with him: He talked most feelingly of inward Tryals, and when I asked him if he had not many such in so close Retirement, he answered, <HI>No wonder that a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Tree, that stands alone, is more exposed to Storms than one that grow among others.</HI> After about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Conversation, we took <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Leave; he kissed me and my Friends, and was much voiced to hear what was doing in <HI>Eng∣land.</HI>—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Germans,</HI> I find, are translating my Journal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> into <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Dutch.</HI> Our Hearts were knit together, and the GOD of Love was with us of a Truth.

In short, I cannot but hope, your Coming amongst us has been a Means of Awakening some among us, to a serious Sense of practical Religion, and may be the Beginning of a good Work in this secure and sinful Place. Dear Sir, let your Prayers be joined with mine, for this desirable Blessing: I desire your Prayers for me in particular; that I may be faithful to my Master's Work; that I may be an Instrument in the Hands of CHRIST, of pulling down the strongest Holds of Sin and Satan, and building up the Redeem∣er's Kingdom in this Place. Pray for us, that the good Impressions any have received, may not wear off, and prove as the Morning Cloud and as the early Dew; but that he would grant a Resurrection of Religion in the Midst of us; that many may flock to CHRIST, as Doves to the Windows. I pray GOD take you under his Protection, sustain you under your many Trials, and make you gloriously success∣ful to convert Sinners from the Error of their Ways, and turning them to the Wisdom of the Just.

Rode to, and preached at <HI>Christian-Bridge,</HI> near five Miles off, to about the same Number as was at <HI>New-Castle.</HI>—I believe 200 Horse came on the Road with us.—I had some edifying Discourse with some Children of GOD, as we came on the Way: And a great Power from GOD descended on me and the Congre∣gation, at the latter Part of the Sermon. I always observe inward Trials prepare me for, and are the certain Fore-runners of fresh Mercies. Oh what a gracious Melting of Souls was there!

Lay at the House of Mr. <HI>G—n;</HI> and this Morning went on board; prayed, sung Psalms, gave a Word of Exhortation, and rejoiced much to see all Things in such excellent Order. My dear Friend, the Captain, told me how kind the People of <HI>Phi∣ladelphia</HI> had been to my Family after my De∣parture; one brought them Butter, another Beer, Sweetmeats, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the Collector would not take his Perquisite for Clearing the Sloop.—The two Children the People were particularly fond of, and gave them so many Things, that I was

obliged to desire them to hold their Hands. <HI>Oh how plentiful are those Mercies which GOD has laid up for them that fear him, even before the Sons of Men!</HI> About Ten we came to <HI>Chri∣stian Bridge</HI> again, where we left some of our Friends last Night. Here we took a little Refreshment, and by Twelve reached <HI>White∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry-Creek,</HI> the place appointed for my Preaching. The Weather was very rainy; but upwards of 8,000 People were assembled together to hear the Word. It surprized <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e to see such a Num∣ber of Horses; I believe there were several Thousands of them. I preached from a Tent erected for me by Order of Mr. <HI>Charles Tennent,</HI> whose Meeting-House lay near the place where I preached. I continued in my first Discourse for an Hour and half: Afterwards we went into a Log House near adjoining; and having taken a Morsel of Bread, and warmed ourselves, I preached a second Time from the same Place. My Body, I perceived, was a little weak; but GOD magnified his Strength, and caused his Power to be known in the Congregation; many Souls were melted down. And here I had the Pleasure of meeting with one Mr. <HI>Galaspey,</HI> mother faithful Minister of JESUS CHRIST, of he Dissenting Interest. He, as well as Mr. <HI>Tennent,</HI> was very solicitous for my going to his House; but being pre-engaged, I rode three Miles, and was kindly and hospitably entertain'd at one Mr. <HI>H</HI>—'s, who came with his Family some Years ago from <HI>Cardi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI>▪—One in the House had heard me preach in <HI>Kingswood;</HI>
<PB N="161" REF="004633_0080_100DB31713DE51A8"/>
and every Thing was carried on with so much Freedom and Love, that I rejoiced much that GOD had sent us hither. I staid up as long as I could; but finding my Body weak, from the Posture in which I stood to preach, about 10 a Clock, after Family Prayer, I went to Bed, thoroughly weary, but full of that Peace which the World cannot give, but which I wish the whole World were Partakers of.</P>

<P><HI>Thursday, December</HI> 6. Had a providential Opportunity of writing some Letters last Night and this Morning to <HI>England.</HI> Waited on Go∣vernor <HI>Ogle,</HI> and was received with Civility. Went to pay my Respects to Mr. <HI>Sterling,</HI> the Minister of the Parish, who happened not to be within; but whilst we were at Dinner, he came, and with the greatest Civility offered me his Pul∣pit, his House, or any Thing he could supply me with. About sour he came and introduced me and my Friends to a Gentleman's House, where we had some useful Conversation: Our Discourse ran chiefly on the New-Birth, and the Folly and Sinfulness of those Amusements, whereby the polite Part of the World are so fatally diverted from the Pursuit after the One Thing needful. Some in Company, I believe, thought me too strict, and were very strenuous in defence of what they call innocent Diversions; but when I told them every Thing was sinful, which
<PB N="165" REF="004633_0082_100DB31BB7E77278"/>
was not done with a single Eye to GOD's Glory; and that such Entertainments not only discover'd a Levity of Mind, but were contrary to the whole Tenour of the Gospel; by this they seemed somewhat convinced, at least it set them upon Doubting: And I pray GOD they may doubt more; for Cards, Dancing, and such like, draw the Soul from GOD, and lull it asleep, as much as Drunkenness and Debauchery. And had a Minister the Authority of an Apostle, he could not imploy it better, than in exclaiming against the Entertainments of the polite Part of the World. For Ladies are as much wedded to <HI>Quadrille</HI> and <HI>Ombre,</HI> as Gentlemen are to their Bottle, and their Hounds: Self-pleasing, self-seeking, is the ruling Principle in both; and therefore, such Things are to be spoken against, not only as so many trifling Amusements, but as Things that shew that the whole Heart is aliena∣ted from the Life of GOD. For if I may speak by my own, as well as others Experience, as soon as ever the Soul is born of GOD, it can∣not away with any such Thing: Nothing but what leads towards GOD, can then delight it. And therefore, when in Company, I love to lay the Ax to the Root of the Tree; shew the Necessity of a thorough Change of Heart, and then all Things fall to the Ground at once.

<P><HI>Sunday, Decem.</HI> 16. Preached in the Morning, and as I was afterwards informed, to the Satis∣faction and Profit of many. Several Gentlemen came from <HI>York,</HI> fourteen Miles off, to hear me, and were desirous of my going back to preach at their Town, on the Morrow. A large Au∣dience might have been expected, I found, could timely Notice have been given; but being in great haste, there being no Sermon customarily in the Afternoon, I din'd with the Commissary, who entertain'd me and my Friends with great Civility, and left <HI>Williamsburg</HI> in the After∣noon, promising, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> possible, to visit these Parts again, some Time in the Summer.

Bashfulness and a Fear of being Troublesome has kept us from embracing Offers of Gentleman's Houses; but we have heard a good Report of the Generosity of the <HI>Virginia</HI> Gentlemen, and I have great reason to believe what is reported; for I find they are so willing and accustomed to entertain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trangers, that f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w think it worth their while to

<P><HI>Tuesday, December</HI> 30. Better this Morning, than I have been for some Days past. Took our Leave of our kind Host, and travelled chear∣fully on. About Noon we lighted off in the Woods, to give our Horses Provender, and to take a little Refreshment ourselves, which we have done every Day this Week, because there are no Ordinaries in the Way. No one can tell with what Gladness we eat our Food; and how comfortably we praised God, for spreading a Table
<PB N="174" REF="004633_0089_100DB32E57071C70"/>
for us in the Wilderness. By four in the After∣noon we reached <HI>Eden-Town,</HI> a little Place, but beautifully scituated by the Water-side. Here we were well entertained at a publick House; and tho' GOD was pleased to humble my Body by Weakness, and my Soul by Convictions of past Sins, yet before we went to Rest, he was pleased to refresh me with much Peace in the midst of my Humiliations; and exalt me, by giving me a more lively Sense of his Favour and loving Kindness. I think, I often feel what our LORD means, when he says, <HI>The</HI> Publican <HI>went down to his House justified, rather than the</HI> Pharisee. I doubt not, but while he was pouring out his Soul and smiting upon his Breast, the Holy Spirit overshadow'd and seal'd to him his Pardon. It is a dreadful Mistake, to deny the Doctrine of Assurance, or to think, it is confined to a Time of Persecution, or the Primitive Ages of the Church. Not only Righteousness and Peace, but Joy in the Holy Ghost (which is the Conse∣quence of Assurance) is a necessary Part of the Kingdom of GOD within us. And tho' all are not to be condemned, who have not an immedi∣ate Assurance, yet all ought to labour after it. And I really believe, one great Reason why so many go mourning all their Life long, is owing to their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gnorance of their Christian Priviledge. They have not Assurance, because they ask it not; they ask it not, because they are taught, that it does not belong to Christians of these last Days; whereas, I know Numbers, whose Salvation is written upon their Hearts, as

After Sermon, a poor Woman with a full Heart, ran to me, desiring me that I would come and preach where she lived. Another told me I had given him a home Stroke.

<P>Soon after Evening Service, I and my Friends took Horse, and rode about 8 Miles▪ and were sweetly entertained at a <HI>German'</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> House, who kept an Ordinary, and had been one of my Hearers.

Wrote this Morning to the Minister of <HI>New-Bern,</HI> who countenanced a Dancing Master, by suffering his own Son to be one of his Pupils. Several of the Inhabitants, I was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, had sub∣scribed to it; and their Meetings were generally attended with ill Consequences; which made me the more desirous to leave my Testimony against it.

Such a Proceeding must be of dreadful Consequence to any, especially a new settled Providence.—All Governors, merely out of a Principle of Human Policy, ought to put a Stop to it.—For <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Entertainments enervate the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of People, and insensibly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them

<P><HI>Wednesday, December</HI> 26. Set out early, and rode very pleasantly till Dinner Time. Me with some comfortable Refreshment at an Or∣dinary upon the Road; and lodged at a little House in the Woods, about 35 Miles off where we lay last Night. The People were appris'd of my Coming, and got such Things as they had, in a decent Manner. We endeavoured to re∣ceive all the Divine Blessings with Thankful∣ness. I had a good deal of Discourse with the People of the House; and after much previous and suitable Conversation, I baptized two Stran∣ger's Children, who providentially lay at the same House that Night.—I believe there may be Hundreds of Children in this Province un∣baptised, for want of a Minister. <HI>Oh that the</HI> LORD <HI>would send forth some, who like</HI> John <HI>the Baptist, might preach, and baptize in the Wilder∣ness!

<P><HI>Thursday, December</HI> 27. Set out about eight in the Morning. Crossed <HI>Trent</HI> River, a Ferry about a half Mile wide; and got to an Ordinary, a little way off the Road, and about 33 Miles Stage, before six at Night: As soon as I came in, a young Man welcomed me into <HI>America,</HI> who,
<PB N="183" REF="004633_0093_100D860C8332AE08"/>
upon enquiry, I found had been one of my Pa∣rishioners at <HI>Savannah:</HI> This gave me an imme∣diate Opportunity of falling into Religious Con∣versation; and after I had done with the Go∣vernors, I went, as my usual Custom is, among the Negroes belonging to the House: One was sick in Bed, and two of his Children, said their Prayers after me very well. This more and more convinces me, that the Negroes Children, if early brought up in the Nurture and Admoni∣tion of the LORD, would make as great a pro∣ficiency <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s any white People's Children whatso∣ever. I do not despair, if GOD spares my Life, to see a School of young Negroes, singing the Praises of him that made them, in a Psalm of Thanksgiving. <HI>LORD, thou hast put into my Heart a good Design to educate them; I doubt not, but thou wilt enable me to bring it to good Effect.

<HI>Monday, December</HI> 31. Set out early, and met with more Perils by Land, than we have been exposed to yet. It having rain'd almost the whole Night; the Swamps and Creeks which lay in the Way, were filled with Water: And the Bridges being out of Repair, rendered Travelling very dangerous. In one Place we were obliged to swim our Horses. In many, the Water was so very high that they could not be passed without much Difficulty. I was such a Coward, as to be sometimes a little fearful. GOD sent us two Guides, by whose Assistance we were carried thro' all, and brought at Night to a little House, where with Pleasure we reflected on the Dangers of the Day; and reminded one another of the unspeakable Satis∣faction we might expect hereafter, from a View of those many Crosses, Difficulties and Tempta∣tions, which we must necessarily endure whilst here on Earth. <HI>Oh that we may learn to endure any Pain, despise any Shame, submit to any Diffi∣culties, out of a believing Prospect of what we shall hereafter reap from them, when placed in Glory at the Right Hand of GOD.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Tuesday, January</HI> 1. Rode about 10 Miles, and to my great Comfort, where we baited, met with one, who, I had great Reason to believe, was a Child of GOD. It somewhat grieved me, that I could stay no longer; but being in Haste, we passed over a Half-Mile Ferry, and about sun-set came to a Tavern lying near five
<PB N="187" REF="004633_0095_100DB33EFAAC9588"/>
Miles in the Province of <HI>South-Carolina.</HI> Here I immediately perceived the People were more polite than those we generally met with. But I believe the People of the House, at first, could have wished I had not come to be their Guest that Night: For it being <HI>New-Years-Day,</HI> several of the Neighbours were met together, in order to divert themselves by dancing Country Dances. By Advice of my Friends, I went in amongst them, while a Woman was Dancing a Jigg. At my first Entrance I endeavoured to shew the Folly of such Entertainments, and to convince her how well pleased the Devil was with every Step she took:—For some Time she endeavoured to out-brave me; neither the Fidler nor she desisted; but at last she gave over, and the Musician laid aside his Instrument. It would have made any one smile, to see how the Rest of the Company, one by one, attacked me, and brought, as they thought, Arguments to support their Wantonness. But CHRIST triumphed over <HI>Satan:</HI> They were all put to Silence; and were for some Time so over-awed, that after I had discoursed with them on the Nature of Baptism, the Necessity of being born again, in order to enjoy the Kingdom of Heaven; at their Entreaty, I baptized one of their Chil∣dren; and prayed afterwards, as I was enabled, and as the Circumstances of the Company required. Then I and my Companions took a little Refreshment. But the People were so bent on their Pleasure, that notwithstanding all that had been said, after I was gone to Bed, I heard

their Musick and Dancing; which made me look back on my own past Follies, with Shame and Confusion of Face; for such a one not long since, was I myself. <HI>LORD, for thy Mercies sake, shew all unhappy Formalists the same Favour, and suffer them not to go on in such a carnal Security till they lift up their Eyes in Torments. Draw them, O <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aw them from Feeding upon such Husks. Let them know what it is to feed upon the fatted Calf: Even the Comforts of the blessed Spirit.</HI> Amen. Amen.</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> 2. Rose very early; prayed, sung a Hymn, and gave a sharp Reproof to the Dan∣cers. They were very attentive, and took it in good Part. At break of Day we mounted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Horses, and I think never had a more pleasant Journey in all my Days: For near 20 Miles we Rode over the Shore of a most beautiful Bay, as plain as a Terras Walk; and as we passed along were wonderfully delighted to see Porpusses taking their Pastime, and Shore resounding to Shore the Praises of him who has set Bounds to the Sea that it cannot pass, and hath said, <HI>Here shall your proud Waves be stayed.</HI> At Night we thought to call at a Gentleman's House, where we had been recommended, about 40 Miles distant from our last Night's Lodging; but the Moon being totally eclipsed, we miss'd the Path that turned out of the Road. We then thought it most adviseable, as we were in the main Road, to go on our Way, trusting to the Almighty to strengthen both our Beasts and us. We had not gone far, but we saw a Light;
<PB N="189" REF="004633_0096_100DB34092F564C0"/>
two of my Friends went up to it, and saw a Hut full of Negroes: They enquired after the Gentleman's House whither we were directed; but the Negroes seem'd surprized, and said they knew no such Man, and that they were but new Comers. From these Circumstances, one of my Friends inferr'd, that these Negroes might be some of those who lately had made an Insurrection in the Province, and were run away from their Masters. When he return'd, we were all of his Mind; and therefore thought it best to mend our Pace. Soon after we saw another great Fire near the Road Side; but imagining there was another Nest of such Negroes, we made a Circuit into the Woods.—One of my Friends, at a Distance, observed them Dancing round the Fire. The Moon shining bright, we soon found our Way into the great Road again; and after we had gone about a Dozen Miles, expecting to find Negroes in every Place, we came to a great Plantation, the Master of which, to our great Comfort, gave us Lodging and our Beasts Provender. Upon our relating the Circumstances of our Travels, he gave us Satisfaction about the Negroes; informed us whose they were, and upon what Occasion they were in those Places in which we found them. This afforded us much Comfort, after we had rode near Three-score Miles, and, as we thought, in great Peril of our Lives. <HI>Blessed be thy Name, O LORD, for this and all other thy Mercies through</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>our LORD.</HI></P>

<HI>Thursday, January</HI> 3. Had a hospitable Breakfast set before us by the Gentleman who last Night received us into his House. Set out late in the Morning. Passed over a Three Mile Ferry, near <HI>George-Town:</HI> And, for the Ease of our Beasts, rode not above 18 Miles the whole Day. <HI>A good Man,</HI> says Solomon, <HI>is merciful to his Beast.

Lay at a little House on <HI>Santee</HI> River; where I met with one of my Red-coat Catechumens, who had been discharged, but retained a grateful Sense of the Instructions that had been given him. Passed over two Ferries in the Morning. Baited at Dinner-Time, after we had rode 18 Miles, and were then obliged to ride 25 Miles more, there being no proper Place to stay by the Way. About Eight in the Evening we came to a Tavern, within Eight Miles of <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> where we comfortably were refreshed with Food convenient for us. We had Family Prayer; and therein endeavoured to express our Thank∣fulness to GOD, for thus causing us to renew our Strength, and bringing us so near a Place where we would be. <HI>Oh! that our Hearts may be excited, more and more, to praise the LORD, for these and all other Mercies, which he daily pours down upon the unworthiest of the Sons of Men!</HI></P>

<P><HI>Saturday, January</HI> 5. Left our Lodgings be∣fore Day-Light, and reached <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> after we had passed over a three Mile Ferry, about ten in the Morning. Went to the House of one Mr. <HI>L—re,</HI> where we dined, and were entertain'd with great Civility. In the Afternoon, several Gentlemen of the Town were so kind as to come and see me, and express'd a great Willingness to hear me preach. Letters and Papers were also brought me from <HI>New-York,</HI> informing me how mightily the Word of GOD grew and pre∣vailed there. The Accounts in the <HI>English</HI> Papers of the War being daily carried on there, betwixt CHRIST and <HI>Belial,</HI> afforded us fresh Matter for Praising that GOD, who, we hoped, would in his Kingdom of Grace bring mighty Things to pass; while the World was buried in Wars and Rumours of Wars.—In the Evening I wrote some Letters to my <HI>English</HI> and <HI>New-York</HI> Friends.—Felt such Comfort within myself as the World cannot give, and verified what the Psalmist says, <HI>They shall be in perfect Peace, whose Minds are staid on thee. Oh that all were Par∣takers of it!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, January</HI> 6. Went to publick Service in the Morning; but did not preach, because the Curate had not a Commission to lend me the Pulpit, unless Mr. <HI>G—n,</HI> then out of Town, had been present: However, most of the Town being very eager to hear me, in the Afternoon I preached in one of the Dissenting Meeting-Houses:
<PB N="192" REF="004633_0098_100DB346B1A46F60"/>
But was grieved to find so little Con∣cern in the Congregation after the Sermon was over. The Auditory was large, but very polite: And I question, whether the Court-End of the Town at <HI>London,</HI> could equal or exceed them in affected Finery and Gaiety of Dress: A De∣portment ill becoming Persons who have had such Divine Judgments lately sent abroad amongst them: I reminded them of it in my Sermon; but I thought at first, I seem'd to them as one that mocked: This made me more importunate in secret Prayer; and I hoped GOD would let me see that he intended to Visit the Inhabitants with Mercy, as well as Judgment. For nothing is a greater sign of People's being harden'd, than their continuing unreformed under divine Visita∣tions. Thus it was with <HI>Pharoah</HI> and the <HI>Egyp∣tians.

Finding the Inhabitants were desirous to hear me a second Time, about eleven in the Morning I preached in the <HI>French</HI> Church; and blessed be GOD, saw a glorious Alteration in the Audience; which was so great that many stood without the Door. And I felt much more Freedom in myself, than I did yesterday. Many were melted into Tears; and one of the Town, the most remarkably gay, was observed to weep. And instead of the People's going out, as they did yesterday, in a light, airy, un∣thinking Manner, a visible Concern was in most of their Faces, as tho' they could not resist the

I appeal to you for Help in the way to Salvation. Pray fail me not: And I beseech you, to pray for my Soul. And the LORD bless you; and grant you may win many Souls to GOD by your sincere Preaching.</Q>—Many also of the Inhabitants, with full Hearts, entreated me to give them one more Sermon: Which I looked upon as a Call from Provid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce; and therefore, tho' I was equipped for Departure, and just a∣bout to take Boat, yet I thought it my Duty to comply with the People's Request, and to put off my Journey 'til the Morrow.—Notice was immediately given, and in about half an Hour a large Congregation was assembled in the Meet∣ing-House, where I preached yesterday, because it was the largest Place. GOD strengthened me to speak, I trust, as I ought to speak. In the Evening, I supped at another Merchant's House: where I had an Opportunity, for near t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ollours, to converse of the Things of GOD, to a large Company. And afterwards retired to my Lodgings, full of Joy, at the Prospect of having a good Work begun in this Place. It grieves me to see People humane, hospitable, willing to oblige, and every way polite; yet ignorant of

The Constitution is far from being arbitrary; the So<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l is good; the Land exceeding fruitful; and there is the greatest Equality between the Poor and the Rich, as perhaps can be found any where in the known World.—And for my Part, I like them so well, that, GOD willing, I propose taking up some Land to erect a School for Negroes, in the latter of them, and settle some of my <HI>English</HI> Friends, whose Hearts GOD shall stir up, or whom the Fury of their Enemies shall oblige, to depart from their Native Country. PHILADELPHIA is one of the most regular Towns I ever saw: Above Seventy new Houses were built in it the last Year; and it is likely to increase in Inhabitants every Day.—It<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> rightly called <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> i. e.

And I saw less of the Pride of Life in <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> than elsewhere: But it has happen'd to them, as it will to all other Religious Societies whatsoever, when they flourish and have the Upper-hand; I mean, many, for Profit's sake, have been known to dissemble with them; and I fear, Numbers amongst them, as amongst us, can give no other Reason why they are <HI>Quakers,</HI> than that their Fathers were so before them. I say this, because I find but little of a Divine Power stirring amongst them; and most of them are too st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ff and rigid about external Things: And, as I was informed by credible Hands, one of their own Preachers warn'd them lately of their Back-sliding, and told them, without a Reformation, GOD would remove their Candlestick from them, and not work by their Hands any more. In the City of <HI>Philadelphia</HI> they have two large Meeting-Houses▪ they assemble frequently together, and, all Things considered, are the most regular Society of Men in the World. Besides this, there is a <HI>Baptist</HI> and <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Meeting.—I had the pleasure of being acquainted with the Ministers of both, and found there was some in their Congregations, particularly in that of the <HI>Baptists,</HI> who loved the LORD JESUS in Sincerity. The <HI>Church of England</HI> is but at a low <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in <HI>Pennsylvania.</HI> in general, and in <HI>Philadelphia</HI> in particular. In all the Places I
<PB N="198" REF="004633_0101_100D861754F39238"/>
passed through, the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> and <HI>Quakers</HI> had larger Congregations than any of our Missionaries,—And we may guess how the Love of many of the <HI>Church of England</HI> in <HI>Philadel∣phia,</HI> must have waxed cold, because the Church, which has been begun, if I mistake not, some Years ago, is far from being finished within: However, many of late have been convinc'd what true Christianity is; and I hope a Party for JESUS CHRIST, will e'er long be selected out of the Members of our own Communion. The little Time I was at NEW-YORK would not permit me to make so many Observations, of the Situation of the Affairs of Religion in that Province, as otherwise I might have done.—A great Complaint was made to me, by some of the most serious Inhabitants, that it was a very secure Place, and that a Work of GOD had never be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> carried on in it, since its first Set∣tlement.—The Heads of the <HI>Church of England</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eem'd resolved to shut out the 
Kingdom of GOD from amongst them:—But our LORD JESUS has been pleased to get himself the Victory; and tho' I was mostly opposed in <HI>New-York,</HI> yet if I may judge of what I saw myself, and have heard since my Departure, as much, if not more, Good has been done there, as in any other Place where I have been, for so short a Time. At MARYLAND Religion seems to be at a very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow Ebb.—There are <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> in some Parts, four Congregations of <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> and a few <HI>Quakers;</HI> but far the greatest Part call themselves of the <HI>Church of
<PB N="199" REF="004633_0101_100D861754F39238"/>
England,</HI> which might, no doubt, greatly flourish, were their Ministers found faithful: But the Government, I fear, spoils them, by giving them too much Tobacco; for some, I hear, have 30,000, others 50,000, others 60,000 Pounds of Tobacco, <HI>per Annum.</HI> It is gathered by the High-Sheriff of the County, and every Taxable is obliged to pay 40 lb. of Tobacco yearly to the Ministers, tho' great Numbers never hear or see them. In VIRGINIA Matters are not quite so bad: The Ministers Stipends are not so large: The Commissary seems to have more Power, and to exercise more Discipline:—But almost all are quite settled upon their Lees; and I could not hear of any true vital Piety subsisting in that Province. In <HI>Maryland</HI> I was told of one Mr. <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lebatch,</HI> a Godly Minister, who died five Years ago. And I heard of another, a Layman, in <HI>Virginia,</HI> who has been dead 25 Years, that did make Religion his chief Business. In <HI>Virginia</HI> are no Dissenters from the establish'd Church, except one Meeting or two of <HI>Quakers.</HI> The Importation of so many Negroes and Convicts, is one great Reason why so little Religion is to be seen: But the main Cause of Irreligion, both in <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Maryland,</HI> I take to be their not Incorporating into Towns; for hereby People living at a Distance from the Church, are apt to make every little Thing serve as an Excuse, to keep them from publick Worship; Religious Societies cannot well be settled, and wicked Men may more easily revel and get drunk without contro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l; Ministers, had
<PB N="200" REF="004633_0102_100D861DDE1D7CE8"/>
they a Will, cannot visit from House to House; and, what is as bad as any Thing, Schools for the Education of Children, cannot be so con∣veniently erected when the Houses are so far separate. The greatest Probability of doing Good in <HI>Virginia,</HI> is among the <HI>Scotch-Irish,</HI> who have lately settled in the mountainous Parts of that Province; they raise little or no Tobacco, but Things that are useful for common Life: And I hear the Governor has given Leave for a Minister of their own Way of Thinking, to come whenever he can be pro∣cured. In NORTH-CAROLINA there's scarce so much as the Form of Religion. There are two Churches begun <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or some Time, but neither finished. There are several Dancing-Masters; but scarce one regularly settled Minister; so that in most Places they have Readers, who read a Sermon every <HI>Sunday</HI> to the People, who pay <HI>five Shillings</HI> a Quarter, of their Currency, which is <HI>Ten Shillings</HI> for <HI>One</HI> of Sterling.—However, the Government, I hear, has made Proposals to the <HI>Society for Propagating the Gospel in Foreign Parts,</HI> to send Missionaries; but I should rather that People had no Ministers, than such as are generally sent over: And I cannot see the Charity of contributing towards <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ending out Missionaries, unless greater Care be taken in the Choice of those that are sent; for it is notorious, the Generality of them walk directly contrary to the Gospel of our LORD JESUS CHRIST. All the Accounts most of them have given for some Time, is, that they
<PB N="201" REF="004633_0102_100D861DDE1D7CE8"/>
have baptized so many, and that so many received the Sacrament▪ And upon the Whole, if it be asked, Why there is so little Religion in the <HI>Church of England?</HI> It may be answered, the Missionaries for the most Part, lead very bad Examples. I think there was a visible Difference as soon as we came into SOUTH-CAROLINA. The People there seem'd to study to be polite. They have many Ministers amongst them, both of our own and other Persuasions; but I hear of no stirring among the dry Bones. Mr. <HI>Garden,</HI> the present Commissary, is strict in the outward Discipline of the Church: The Clergy have an Annual Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting; and most of them, I believe, are kept from open Immoralities. And now I am come to GEORGIA, What shall I say of thee, poor SAVANNAH? Many of thy Inhabitants have left thee since we were here last; but still I hope Blessings are yet in reserve. Oh that thy Inhabitants would acquaint themselves with GOD, and be at Peace with him! Then wouldst thou be more than Conqueror over all thy Enemies.—Thus have I put down a few Thoughts that have occurred to my Mind. <HI>May GOD enlighten me where I am in the Dark, correct me where I am wrong, and bless this further Account of his Dealings with me, to the Conviction of Gain-sayers; the Comfort of Saints, and to the Edification of all that shall read it. Even so, LORD</HI> JESUS, <HI>Amen▪</HI> and <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
