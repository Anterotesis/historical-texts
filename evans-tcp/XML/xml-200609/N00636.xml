And howsoever your Charity may have met with some occasion of discouragement through the misreport of our intentions, or through the dis∣affection, or indiscretion, of some of us, or ra∣ther amongst us: for we are not of those that dream of perfection in this World; yet we desire you would be pleased to take notice of the Principals, and Body of our Company, as those who esteem it our honour to call the Church of <HI>England,</HI> from whence we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ise, our dear Mother, and cannot part from our Native Country, where she specially resideth, without much sadness of heart, and many tears in our eyes, ever acknowledging that such hope and part as we have obtained in the common sal∣vation, we have received in her bosome, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uck<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from her breasts: we leave it not there∣fore,

<P>Be pleased therefore <HI>Reverend</HI> FATHERS and BRETHREN, to help forward this work now in hand; which if it prosper, you shall be the more glorious: howsoever your judg∣ment is with the LORD, and your reward with your God. It is an usual and laudable exercise of your charity, to commend to the prayers of your Congregations the necessities &amp; straits of your private neighbours; Do the like for a Church springing out of your own bow∣els. We conceive much hope that this re∣membrance of us, if it be frequent and fer∣vent, will be a most prosperous gale in ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sailes, and provide such a passage and welcome for us, from the GOD of the whole Earth, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> both we which shall find it, and your selves▪ with the rest of our friends, who shall hear of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, shall be much inlarged to bring in such daily returns of Thanksgivings, as the special∣ties of his Providence and Goodness may justly

<P>What we intreat of you that are the Mini∣sters of GOD, that we also crave at the hands of all the rest of our Brethren, that they would at no time forget us in their private solicitati∣ons at the Throne of Grace. If any there be, who through want of clear intelligence of our course, or tenderness of affection towards us, cannot conceive so well of our way as we could desire, we would intreat such not to de∣spise us, nor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> desert us in their prayers and affections, but to consider rather, that they are so much the more bound to express the bow∣els of their compassion towards us, remembring always that both Nature and Grace, doth ever bind us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o relieve and rescue with our utmost and speediest power, such as are dear unto us, when we conceive them to be running uncom∣fortable hazards.</P>

FOR the satisfaction of Your Honour, and some Friends, and for the use of such as shall hereafter intend to increase our Plantati∣on in <HI>New England,</HI> I have in the throng of Domestick, and not altogether free from Pub∣lick Business, thought fit to commit to memo∣ry our present condition, and what hath be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al∣len us since our Arrival here; which I will do shortly, after my usual manner, and must do rudely, having yet no Table▪ nor other Room to Write in, then by the Fire-side upon my knee, in this sharp Winter; to which my Fa∣mily must have leave to resort, though they break good manners, and make me many times forget what I would say, and say what I would not.</P>
<P>Concerning the <HI>English</HI> that are Planted here: I find that about the Year 1620. Cer∣tain <HI>English</HI> set out from <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yden</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> in∣tending their Course for <HI>Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on'</HI>s River.</P>
<P>These being much Weather beaten, and wearied with seeking the River, after a most tedious Voyage, Arrived at length in a small Bay, lying North-East from <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d;</HI> where Landing about the Month of <HI>December,</HI> by the favour of a calm Winter, such as was never seen here since, begun to Build their Dwellings in that place, which now is cal∣led <HI>New-Plimouth:</HI> Where after much Sick∣ness,
<PB N="10" REF="000773_0010_0FAA54446CC8FB28"/>
Famine, Poverty and great Mortality, (through all which, God by an unwonted Providence carried them) they are now grown up to a People, Healthful, Wealthy, Politick and Religious; such things doth the Lord for those that wait for his Mercies. They of <HI>Pli∣mouth</HI> came with Patents from King <HI>James,</HI> and have since obtained others, from our So∣veraign, King <HI>Charles,</HI> having a Governour and Council of their own: There was about the same time, one Mr. <HI>Weston,</HI> an <HI>English</HI> Mer∣chant, who sent divers men to Plant and Trade; who sate down by the River of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> but these coming not for so good ends as those of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> sped not so well; for the most of them Dying and Languishing away, They who survived were rescued by those of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> out of the hands of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> &amp; his <HI>Indians,</HI> who oppressed those weak <HI>English,</HI> and intended to have destroyed them: And the <HI>Ply<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>otheans</HI> also, as is set down in a Tract, Written by Mr. <HI>Winslow</HI> of <HI>Plymouth:</HI> Also since, one Captain <HI>Wollaston</HI> with some Thir∣ty with him, came near to the same place, and Built on an Hill, which he named Mount <HI>Wollaston;</HI> but being not supplied with renew∣ed Provisions, they vanished away as the for∣mer did. Also divers Merchants of <HI>Bristol,</HI> and some other places, have yearly for these eight years, or thereabouts, sent Ships hither at
<PB N="11" REF="000773_0011_0FAA5446E997DB90"/>
the Fishing times, to Trade for Bever, where their Factors dishonestly for their gains, have furnished the <HI>Indians</HI> with Guns, Swords, Pow∣der and Shot.</P>
<P>Touching the Plantation which we here have begun: it fell out thus. About the Year 1627. some Friends being together in <HI>Lincoln∣shire,</HI> fell into discourse about <HI>New En∣gland,</HI> and the Planting of the Gospel there; and after some deliberation, we imparted our reasons, by Letters and Messages, to some in <HI>London</HI> and the <HI>West Country;</HI> where it was likewise deliberately thought upon, and at length with often negotiation so ripened, that in the year 1628. we procured a Patent from His Majesty for our Planting between the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> Bay and <HI>Charles</HI> River on the South, and the River of <HI>Merrimack</HI> on the North, and three miles on either side of those Rivers and Bay; as also for the Government of those who did or should Inhabit within that Compass: And the same year we sent Mr. <HI>John Endicott,</HI> and some with him, to begin a Plantation; and to strengthen such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he should find there, which we sent thi∣ther from <HI>Dorchester,</HI> and some places adjoyn∣ing: from whom the same year receiving hopeful News: The next year, 1629. we sent divers Ships over, with about Three Hundred People, and some Cowes, Goats and Horses,
<PB N="12" REF="000773_0012_0FAA544894F0CF30"/>
many of which Arrived safely. These by their too large Commendations of the Coun∣try, and the Commodities thereof, invited us so strongly to go on, that Mr. <HI>Winthrop</HI> of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> (who was well known in his own Country, and well approved here, for his Pie∣ty, Liberality, Wisdom and Gravity) coming in to us, we came to such resolution, that in <HI>April,</HI> 1630 we set Sail from Old <HI>England</HI> with four good Ships. And in <HI>May</HI> following eight more followed; two having gone before in <HI>February</HI> and <HI>March,</HI> and two more follow∣ing in <HI>June</HI> and <HI>August,</HI> besides another Set ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by a private Merchant. These seventeen Ship Arrived all safe in <HI>New England,</HI> for the in∣crease of the Plantation here this year 1630▪ but made a long, a troublesome and costly Voyage, being all Wind bound long in <HI>England</HI> and hindred with contrary Winds, after they set Sail, and so scartered with Mists and Tem∣pests, that few of them Arrived together. Ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> four Ships which set out in <HI>April,</HI> Arrived here in <HI>June</HI> and <HI>July,</HI> where we found the Colony in a sad and unexpected condition, above Eighty of them being Dead the Winter be∣fore; and many of those alive, weak and sick; all the Corn and Bread amongst them all, hardly sufficient to feed them a fortnight: insomuch that the remainder of an Hundred and Eighty Servants we had the two years
<PB N="13" REF="000773_0013_0FAA5449ECCF2160"/>
before sent over, coming to us for Victuals to sustain them, we found our selves wholly una∣ble to feed them, by reason that the Provisions Shipped for them, were taken out of the Ship they were put in; and they who were trusted to Ship them in another, failed us, and le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t them behind; whereupon necessity enforced us to our extreme loss, to give them all Liber∣ty; who had cost us about Sixteen or Twenty Pound a Person, furnishing and sending over. But bearing these things as we might, we began to consult of the Place of our Sitting down: For <HI>Salem</HI> where we Landed, pleased <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s not. And to that purpose, some were sent to the Bay, to search up the Rivers for a con∣venient place; who upon their return, report∣ed to have found a good place upon <HI>Mistick;</HI> but some other of us, seconding these, to ap∣prove or dislike of their judgment; we found a place liked us better, three Leagues up <HI>Charles</HI> River: And thereupon Unshipped our Goods into other Vessels, and with much Cost and Labour, brought them in <HI>July</HI> to <HI>Charlstown;</HI> but there receiving advertisements (by some of the late arrived Ships) from <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Amsterdam</HI> of some <HI>French</HI> Preparations against us (many of our people brought with us being sick of Fevers, and the Scurvy, and we there∣by unable to carry up our Ordinance and Bag∣gage so far) we were forced to change coun∣sel,
<PB N="14" REF="000773_0014_0FAA544A6F815C98"/>
and for our present shelter to Plant disper∣sedly, some at <HI>Charlstown,</HI> which standeth on the North-side of the mouth of <HI>Charles</HI> Ri∣ver; some on the South-side thereof, which place we named <HI>Boston</HI> (as we intended to have done the place we first resolved on) some of us upon <HI>Mistick,</HI> which we named <HI>Meadford;</HI> some of us Westward on <HI>Charles</HI> River, four miles from <HI>Charlstown,</HI> which place we named <HI>Watertown;</HI> others of us two miles from <HI>Boston,</HI> in a place we named <HI>Roxbury</HI> others upon the River of <HI>Sawgus,</HI> between <HI>Sa∣lem</HI> and <HI>Charlstown:</HI> And the Western men four miles South from <HI>Boston,</HI> at a place w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> named <HI>Dorchester.</HI> This Dispersion troubled some of us, but help it we could not, wanting ability to remove to any place fit to Build a Town upon; and the time too short to deli∣berate any longer, least the Winter should sur∣prize us before we had Builded our Houses. The best counsel we could find out was to Build a Fort to retire to, in some convenient place, if any Enemy pressed us thereunto, after we should have fortifyed our selves against the injuries of wet and cold. So ceasing to consult further for that time, they who had Health to Labour, fell to Building, wherein many were interrupted with Sickness, and ma∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Dyed weekly, yea, almost daily. Amongst whom were Mrs. <HI>Pinchon,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Coddington,</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="000773_0015_0FAA544B335C48F0"/>
Mrs. <HI>Phillips,</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Alcock,</HI> a Sister of Mr. <HI>Hookers.</HI> Insomuch that the Ships being now upon their Return, some for <HI>England,</HI> some for <HI>Ireland;</HI> there was as I take it not much less than an Hundred (some think many more) partly out of dislike of our Government, which restrained and punished their Excesses; and partly through fear of Famine, not seeing o∣ther means than by their Labour to feed them∣selves) which returned back again; and glad were we so to be rid of them. Others also afterwards hearing of men of their own Dis∣position, which were Planted at <HI>Pascataway,</HI> went from us to them; whereby though our Numbers were lessened, yet we accounted our selves nothing weakned by their Removal: Before the Departure of the Ships, we con∣tracted with Mr. <HI>Peirce,</HI> Master of the <HI>Lyon</HI> of <HI>Bristol,</HI> to Return to us with all speed, with fresh supplies of Victuals, and gave him dire∣ctions accordingly; with this Ship returned Mr. <HI>Revil,</HI> one of the five Undertakers here, for the joynt Stock of the Company; and Mr. <HI>Vassal,</HI> one of the Assistants, and his Fa∣mily; and also Mr. <HI>Bright,</HI> a Minister sent hi∣ther the year before: The Ship being gone, Victuals wasting, and Mortality increasing, we held divers Fasts in our several Congregations, but the Lord would not yet be Deprecated; for about the beginning of <HI>September,</HI> Dyed
<PB N="16" REF="000773_0016_0FAA544C24294F18"/>
Mr. <HI>Gager,</HI> a right Godly man, a skilful Chy∣rurgeon, and one of the Deacons of our Con∣gregation. And Mr. <HI>Higginson,</HI> one of the Ministers of <HI>Salem,</HI> a zealous and a profitable Preacher; this of a Consumption, that of a Fever: And on the 30<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>September,</HI> Dyed Mr. <HI>Johnson,</HI> another of the five Undertakers, (the Lady <HI>ARBELLA</HI> his Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e being Dead a Month before) This Gentleman was a prime man amongst us, having the best Estate of a∣ny; zealous for Religion, and the greatest fur∣therer of this Plantation; he made a most Godly End, Dying willingly, professing his Life better spent in promoting this Plantation, than it could have been any other way. He left to us a Loss greater then the most conceiv∣ed. Within a month after, Dyed Mr. <HI>Rossiter,</HI> another of our Assistants, a Godly man, and of a good Estate, which still weakned us more: So that now there were left of the five Undertakers, but the Governour, Sir <HI>Richard Saltonstall,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d my self, and seven other of the Assistants. And of the People who came o∣ver with us, from the time of their Setting Sail from <HI>England,</HI> in <HI>April</HI> 1630. until <HI>Decem∣ber</HI> following, there Dyed by Estimation about Two Hundred at the least; so low hath the Lord brought us! Well, yet they who Survi∣ved were not discouraged, but bearing Gods Corrections with Humility, and trusting in His
<PB N="17" REF="000773_0017_0FAA544CAF0E4F78"/>
Mercies, and considering how after a lower ebb he had raised up our Neighbours at <HI>Ply∣mouth,</HI> we began again in <HI>December</HI> to consult about a fit place to Build a Town upon; lea∣ving all thoughts of a Fort, because upon any Invasion, we were necessarily to lose our Hou∣ses, when we should retire thereinto: So after divers Meetings at <HI>Boston, Roxbury</HI> and <HI>Water∣town,</HI> on the Twenty Eighth of <HI>December,</HI> we grew to this resolution, to bind all the Assist∣ants (Mr. <HI>Endicott,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Sharp</HI> excepted, which last purposeth to return by the next Ship into <HI>England</HI>) to Build Houses, at a place a mile East from <HI>Watertown,</HI> near <HI>Charles</HI> Ri∣ver, the next Spring, and to Winter there the next year; that so by our Examples, and by removing the Ordnance and Munition thither, all who were able, might be drawn thither, and such as shall come to us hereafter to their advantage, be compelled so to do; and so if God would, a Fortifyed Town might there grow up, the place fitting reasonably well there∣to. I should before have mentioned how both the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> Corn being at ten shil∣lings a strike, and Bever being valued at six shillings a Pound; we made Laws to restrain the Selling of Corn to the <HI>Indians,</HI> and to leave the price of Bever at liberty, which was pre∣sently Sold for ten, and twenty Shillings a Pound. I should also have remembred, how
<PB N="18" REF="000773_0018_0FAA544D6B328C48"/>
the half of our Cowes, and almost all our Mares and Goates, sent us out of <HI>England,</HI> Dy∣ed at Sea, in their Passage hither; and that those intended to be sent us out of <HI>Ireland,</HI> were not sent at all; all which, together with the loss of our six months Building occasioned by our intended Removal to a Town to be Forti∣fyed, weakned our Estates, especially the E∣states of the Undertakers, who were Three or Four Thousand Pounds ingaged in the joynt stock, which was now not above so many Hun∣dreds; yet many o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> us laboured to bear it as comfortably as we could, remembring the end of our Coming hither, and knowing the power of God, who can support and raise us again; and useth to bring his Servants low, that the meek may be made glorious by Deliverance.</P>
<P>I have no leisure to Review and Insert things forgotten, but out of due time and order must set them down as they come to memory. A∣bout the end of <HI>October,</HI> this year 1630. I joyned with the Governour, and Mr. <HI>Mave∣rick</HI> in sending out our Pinace to the <HI>Narra∣gansetts,</HI> to Trade for Corn, to supply our wants; but after the Pinace had doubled <HI>Cape Cod,</HI> she put into the next Harbour she found, and there meeting with <HI>Indians,</HI> who shewed their willingness to Truck; she made her Voyage there, and brought us an Hundred
<PB N="19" REF="000773_0019_0FAA544FC4F6EF60"/>
Bushels of Corn, at about four shillings a Bush∣el, which helped us something. From the Coast where they Traded, they saw a very large Island, four Leagues to the East, which the <HI>Indians</HI> commended as a fruitful place, full of good Vines, and free from sharp Frosts, having one only Entrance into it▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y a Navi∣gable River, Inhabited by a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew <HI>Indians,</HI> which for a trifle would leave the Island, if the <HI>En∣glish</HI> would set them upon the Main; but the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ina<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e having no direction for Discovery, re∣turned without Sailing to it, which in two Hours they might have done: Upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Coast they found store of Vines full of Grapes dead ripe, the Season being past; whither we pur∣pose to send the next year sooner, to make some small quantity of Wine, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> God inable us; the Vines growing thin with us, and we not having yet any leisure to Plant Vineyards. But now having some leisure to discourse of the motives for other mens coming to this place, or their abstaining from i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; after my brief manner, I say this That if any come hither to Plant for Worldly Ends, that can live well at Home, he commits an Error, of which he will soon repent him: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for Spiritual, and that no particular <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hinder his Removal, he may find <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere what may well content him: <ABBR><HI>viz</HI></ABBR> Materials to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>wel to Burn, Ground to Plant, S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s and Rivers to

Fish in, a pure Air to Breath in, good Water to drink, till Wine or Beer can be made; which together with the Cowes, Hoggs and Goats brought hither already, may suffice for Food; as for Fowl and Venison, they are Dainties here as well as in <HI>England.</HI> For Cloaths and Bedding, they must bring them with them, till time and industry produce them here. In a word, we yet enjoy little to be envyed, but endure much to be pittied in the Sickness▪ and Mortality of our People: And I do the more willingly use this open and pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> dealing, least other men should fall short of their expectations, when they come hither, as we to our great prejudice did; by means of Letters sent us from hence into <HI>En∣gland;</HI> wherein honest men out of a desire to draw over others to them, wrote somewhat hyperbolically of many things here: If any Godly men out of Religious Ends will come over, to help us in the good Work we are a∣bout: I think they cannot dispose of them∣selves, nor of their Estates more to God's Glo∣ry, and the furtherance of their own Reckon∣ing: But they must not be of the poorer sort yet, for divers years. For we have found by experience, that they have hindred, not fur∣thered the Work: And for profane and de∣bauched persons, their oversight in coming hi∣ther is wondred at, where they shall find no∣thing
<PB N="21" REF="000773_0021_0FAA5451DE6167A0"/>
to content them. If there be any En∣dued with Grace, and furnished with means to feed themselves and theirs for eighteen months, and to Build and Plant, let them come into our <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edonia,</HI> and help us, and not spend themselves and their Estates in a less profitable Employment: for others, I conceive they are not yet fitted for this Business.</P>
<P>Touching the Discouragement which the Sickness and Mortality which every first year hath seized upon us, and those of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> as appeareth before, may give to such who have cast any thoughts this way (of which Morta∣lity it may be said of us almost as of the <HI>E∣gyptians,</HI> that there is not an House where there is not one dead, and in some Houses many) the natural causes seem to be, the want of warm Lodging, and good Dyet, to which <HI>English</HI> men are habituated at home; and in the sudden increase of heat, which they endure that are Landed here in Summer; the salt meats at Sea having prepared their Bodies thereto; for those only these two last years dyed of Fevers, who Landed in <HI>June</HI> and <HI>July;</HI> as those of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> who Landed in Winter, dyed of the Scurvy; as did our poor∣er sort, whose Housing and Beding, kept them not sufficiently warm, nor their Dyet suffici∣ently in heart: other causes God may have, as our Faithful Minister, Mr. <HI>Wilson</HI> (lately
<PB N="22" REF="000773_0022_0FAA545219D6F1C8"/>
handling that point) shewed unto us; which I forbear to mention, leaving this matter to the further Dispute of Physicians and Divines.</P>
<P>Wherefore to return, upon the Third of <HI>January,</HI> Dyed the Daughter of Mr. <HI>Sharp,</HI> a Godly Virgin, making a comfortable end, af∣ter a long sickness. The Plantation here re∣ceived not the like loss of any Woman, since we came hither; and therefore she well de∣serves to be remembred in this Place.</P>
<P>Amongst those who Dyed about the end of this <HI>January,</HI> there was a Girl of Eleven Years Old, the Daughter of one <HI>John R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ggles,</HI> who in the time of her Sickness, expressed to the Minister, and those about her, so much Faith and Assurance of Salvation, as is rarely found in any of that Age; which I thought not un∣worthy here to commit to memory: and if any tax me for wasting paper with Recording these small matters; such may consider, that small things in the beginning of natural or po∣litick Bodies, are as remarkable as greater, in Bodies full grown</P>
<P>Upon the fifth of <HI>February,</HI> Arrived here Mr. <HI>Pierce,</HI> with the Ship <HI>Lyon</HI> of <HI>Bristol,</HI> with supplies of Victuals from <HI>England;</HI> who had set forth from <HI>Bristol</HI> the first of <HI>December</HI> be∣fore. He had a Stormy Passage hither, and lost one of his Saylors not far from our Shore, who in a Tempest having helped to take in
<PB N="23" REF="000773_0023_0FAA5452B5086698"/>
the Sprit Sail, lost his hold as he was coming down, and fell into the Sea; where, after long Swimming, he was Drowned, to the great dolour of those in the Ship, who beheld so la∣mentable a Spectacle, without being able to minister help to him, the Sea was so so high, and the Ship drove so fast before the Wind, though her Sails were taken down. By this Ship we understand of the Fight of three of our Ships, and two <HI>English</HI> Men of War co∣ming out of the <HI>Straits,</HI> with Fourteen <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣kirks,</HI> upon the Coast of <HI>England,</HI> as they Re∣turned from us, in the end of the last Sum∣mer; who through Gods Goodness, with the loss of some thirteen or fourteen men, out of our three Ships; and I know not how many out of the two Men of War, got at length clear of them. The <HI>Charles,</HI> one of our three, a stout Ship, of 300 Tonn, being so torn, that she had not much of her le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t whole above wa∣ter. By this Ship we also understand of the Death of many of those who went from us the last year to <HI>England,</HI> as likewise of the Mortality there; whereby we see there are Graves in other places as well as with us.</P>
<P>Amongst others who Dyed about this time, was Mr. <HI>Robert Welden,</HI> who in the time of his Sickness we had Chosen to be Captain of 100. Foot, but before he took possession of his place, he Dyed, the sixteenth of this <HI>February,</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="000773_0024_0FAA545374FBF318"/>
and was Buried as a Souldier, with three Vol∣lyes of Sho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. Upon the Twenty Second of <HI>February</HI> we Held a General Day of Thanks∣giving throughout the whole Colony, for the safe Arrival of the Ship which came last with our Provisions.</P>
<P>Upon the Eighth of <HI>March,</HI> from after it was fair day light, until about Eight of the Clock in the Forenoon, there flew over all the Towns in our Plantations, so many Flocks of Doves, each Flock containing many Thousands, and some so many, that they obscured the Light, that it passeth credit, if but the Truth should be written; and the thing was the more strange, because I scarce remember to have seen ten Doves since I came into the Country: They were all Turtles, as appeared by divers of them we killed Flying, somewhat bigger than those of <HI>Europe,</HI> and they flew from the North-east, to the South-west; but what it portends, I know not.</P>
<P>The Ship now waits but for Wind, which when it B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owes, there are ready to go Aboard therein for <HI>England,</HI> Sir <HI>Richard Saltonstall,</HI> Mr. <HI>Sharp,</HI> Mr. <HI>Coddington,</HI> and many others; the most whereof purpose to return to us again, if God will. In the mean time, we are lest a People poor and contemptible, yet such as Trust in God; and are contented with our condition, being well assured, that he will not
<PB N="25" REF="000773_0025_0FAA54543297B8A0"/>
fail us nor forsake us. I had almost forgotten to add this, That the Wheat we received by this last Ship, stands us in thirteen or fourteen shillings a strike, and the Pease about eleven shillings a strike, besides the Adventure, which is worth three or four shillings a strike; which is an higher price than I ever tasted Bread of before.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>Madam,</HI> I have as I can, told Your Honour, all our matters; knowing Your Wis∣dom can make good use thereof. If I Live not to perform the like Office of my Duty hereafter, likely it is, some other will do it better.</P>
<P>Before the departure of the Ship (which yet was Wind-bound) there came unto us Sagamore <HI>John,</HI> and one of his Subjects, requiring satis∣faction for the Burning of two Wigwams, by some of the <HI>English;</HI> which Wiggwams were not Inhabited, but stood in a place convenient for their shelter, when upon occasion, they should Travel that way. By Examination we found that some <HI>English</HI> Fowlers, having reti∣red into that which belonged to the Subject; and leaving a Fire therein carelesly which they had kindled to warm them, were the cause of Burning thereof. For that which was the Sa∣gamores, we could find no certain proof how it was Fired: yet least he should think us not sedulous enough to find it out, and so should
<PB N="26" REF="000773_0026_0FAA545520DDAA70"/>
depart discontentedly from us; we gave both him and his Subject, satisfaction for them both.</P>
<P>The like accident of Fire also befel Mr. <HI>Sharp,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Colborn,</HI> upon the seventeenth of this <HI>March;</HI> both whose Houses (which were as good, and as well furnished as the most in the Plantation) were in two hours space Burned to the ground; together with much of their Houshold-stuff, Apparel, and other things; as also some Goods of others, who Sojourned with them in their Houses; God so pleasing to exercise us with Correcti∣ons of this kind, as he hath done with others. For the prevention whereof, in our New Town intended this Summer to be Builded; we have ordered that no man there shall Build his Chimney with Wood, nor cover his House with Thatch, which was readily assented un∣to; for that divers other Houses have been Burned since our Arrival.</P>
<P>Upon the Eighteenth Day of <HI>March,</HI> came one from <HI>Salem,</HI> and told us, that upon the Fifteenth thereof, there Dyed Mrs. <HI>Skelton,</HI> the Wife of the other Minister there. She was a Godly and an helpful Woman, she lived desired, and dyed lamented, and well deserves to be honourably remembred.</P>
<P>Upon the Twenty fifth of this <HI>March,</HI> one of <HI>Watertown</HI> having lost a Calf, and about ten of the Clock at night, hearing the How∣ling
<PB N="27" REF="000773_0027_0FAA5455C5056A68"/>
of some Wolves not far off, raised many of his Neighbours out of their Beds; that by Discharging their Muskets near about the place where he heard the Wolves, he might so put the Wolves to flight, and save his Calf: The Wind serving fit to carry the Report of the Muskets to <HI>Roxbury,</HI> three miles off, at such a time; the Inhabitants there took an Alarm, Beat up their Drum, Armed themselves, and sent in Post to us to <HI>Boston,</HI> to Raise us also: So in the morning, the Calf being found safe, the Wolves affrighted, and our danger past, we went merrily to Breakfast.</P>
<P>I thought to have ended before, but the stay of the Ship, and my desire to inform Your Honour of all I can, hath caused this Addition: And every one having warning to prepare for the Ships departure to morrow, I am now this Twenty Eighth of <HI>March,</HI> 1631. Sealing my Letters.</P>

<PB N="28" REF="000773_0028_0FAA5456877B0618"/>
<HEAD>The PREFACE of the Reverend Mr. John Allin, of Dedham, and of Mr. Thomas She∣pard of Cambridge in New-England, before their De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence of the Answer made unto the Nine Questions.</HEAD>
<P>IT was the Profession of the Lord Jesus be∣fore <HI>Pilate,</HI> when he questioned with him about his Kingdom, John 18. 37. That for this cause he was born and came into the world, to bear witness of the Truth. Many Truths about the Spiritual Kingdom of Christ hath he imparted to us; if therefore we be born into the world, or sent into this Wilder∣ness to bear witness to his Truth, it is unto us reward sufficient, that we should be Witnesses thereunto, even to the Utmost parts of the Earth. We confess we have been too slow in this Service of Christ, not having to this day set forth an unanimous Confession of that Form of wholsome words which is Preached, received and professed in these Churches of the Lord Jesus; and which we are not un∣mindful of, though our distances, and other difficulties may delay the opportunity. But
<PB N="29" REF="000773_0029_0FAA54572D3D8EE8"/>
this in the mean time we profess in general, That (so far as we know) there is the same blefled Spirit of Truth breathing in the Mini∣stry of the Country; the same Faith embra∣ced and professed in the Churches, which is generally received as the Orthodox Doctrine of the Gospel, in the best reformed Churches, and particularly by our Godly Learned Bre∣thren of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland.</HI> And though Errors have sprung up among us, and some are gone out from us, that we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear were not of us, yet we have born witness against them, and by the blessing of God, by the breath of Christ in the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ths of his Servants they have been blasted. Neither do we understand that these Churches are accused of any Errors about the saving Truths of the Gospel, and therefore we thought our selves not so much called of God to such a Confession at present, as to clear up to the World those Truths we profess a∣bout the Kingdom and Government of Christ in his Churches; which is the great work of this age, and of this nick of time. And yet here also we fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r that we have been too slack; for though it be said, <HI>We are the Volun∣teers, such as cry up this way, &amp;c.</HI> and so it seems we are apprehended to be one cause of these present differences: yet if things be well weighed, we may seem rather to be far be∣hind in the duty that lies upon us. Indeed
<PB N="30" REF="000773_0030_0FAA5457EE985C28"/>
some brief Answers sent over to some particu∣lar persons, to satisfie Brethren what our pra∣ctise is, (with some brief touch of our reasons) rather than to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iscuss those points, have been printed by some without our knowledge, or assent, upon what grounds they best know. And some short Treatises by some Reverend Brethren have been published to declare their affectionate desires of the unanimous endea∣vours of all our dear Brethren, for a general and holy Reformation. But what hath been said or done▪ that either may justly offend the minds of the godly, provoke their spirits, dis∣unite their affections, or hinder a godly Refor∣mation? Yea, we have been too slow to clear our Doctrine and practise from the many ob∣jections, harsh interpretations, and manifold Crimin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cast upon the same, wherein we fear our l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thness to intermeddle in these Con∣troversies for fear o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> making the breach wider amongst Brethren; and our desire rather to attend what light we might receive from o∣thers in these points, wherein we profess our selves seekers a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter the Truth, have made us guilty of neglect in this our duty. But now we see our selves pressed hereto, by a necessity of justifying our waves against the many as∣persions cast upon them, as well as against the reasons used against them. For we perceive by the first Letters of our Brethren, how the with∣drawing
<PB N="31" REF="000773_0031_0FAA545906606E58"/>
drawing of Christians from the Liturgy was imputed to us, and by this Reply both in the Epistle and divers passages, we cannot but see what apprehensions are raised of us; yea, ma∣ny are apt to think, that if we had said no∣thing, yet our very act in forsaking the Church∣es of God in our dear native Country, and the Cause of Christ there, together with the pra∣ctise of these Churches, thought to be so different from the reformed Churches, have been, not only a great weakening to the hands of the Godly, (that have stood by the Cause of Christ) but also have caused great distur∣bance to the Reformation in hand: To which much might be said, but that we should exceed the bounds of an Epistle. Yet let us intreat all the Godly wise, to consider and look back upon the season of this great Enterprise, un∣dertaken by us, and the manner of our pro∣ceedings in it, with the admirable workings of Gods Providence first and last about it; and we think (though we were silent) they may easily satisfie themselves, whether this was of God or men; a sinful neglect of the Cause of Christ, or a manifest attestation to the Truth, by open profession against Corrupti∣ons of Worship in use, and for the necessity of Reformation of the Church; and that confirmed by no small degree of Sufferings for the same. For was it not a time when
<PB N="32" REF="000773_0032_0FAA5459D79C5F60"/>
Humane Worship and Inventions were grown to such an intolerable height, that the Consci∣ences of Gods Saints and Servants, inlightened in the truth, could no longer bear them? was not the power of the tyranical Prelates so great, that like a strong Current, carried all down stream before it; whatever was from the Law, or otherwise set in their way? Did not the hearts of men generally fail them? Where was the people to be found that would cleave to their godly Ministers in their suffer∣ings; but rather thought it their discretion, to provide for their own quiet and safety? Yea, when some freely in zeal of the Truth preached or professed against the corruptions of the times, old not some take offence at it, judge it rashness, and to be against all rules of discretion, who since are ready to censure us for deserting the Cause? Many then thought, it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il time, the prudent shall hold their peace, and might we not say, This is not our resting place? And what would men have us do in such a case? Must we study some di∣stinctions to salve our Consciences in comply∣ing with so manifold corruptions in Gods Worship? or should we live without God's Ordinances, because we could not partake in the corrupt administration thereof? or con∣tent our selves to live without those Ordinan∣ces of Gods Worship and Communion of
<PB N="33" REF="000773_0033_0FAA545A2D6BF5D0"/>
Saints, which he called us unto, and our Souls breathed after? or should we forsake the publick Assemblies, and joyn together in pri∣vate separated Churches? how unsufferable it would then have been, the great offence that now is taken at it, is a full evidence. And if in Cities, or some such great Towns, that might have been done, yet how was it possi∣ble for so many scattered Christians all over the Countrey? It is true, we might have suf∣fered, if we had sought it, we might easily have found the way to have filled the Prisons, and some had their share therein. But whe∣ther we were called thereunto, when a wide door was set open of liberty otherwise; and our witness to the Truth (through the malig∣nant policy of those times) could not be open before the world, but rather smothered up in close prisons or some such wayes, together with our selves, we leave to be considered. We cannot see but the rule of Christ to his Apostles and Saints, and the practise of Gods Saints in all Ages, may allow us this liberty as well as others, to fly into the Wilderness from the face of the Dragon. But if it had been so, that the Godly Ministers and Christians that fled to <HI>New England,</HI> were the most timo∣orus and faint hearted of all their Brethren, that stayed behind, and that those Sufferings were nothing in comparison of their Brethrens
<PB N="34" REF="000773_0034_0FAA545C25BE9518"/>
(for why should any boast of sufferings?) yet who doth not know that the Spirit who gives various gifts, and all to profit withal, in such times doth single out every one to such work, as he in wisdom intends to call them unto? And whom the Lord will honour by suffering for his Cause, by imprisonment, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> he gives them spirits suitable thereto: whom the Lord will reserve for other service, or im∣ploy in other places, he inclines their hearts ra∣ther to fly, giving them an heart suitable to such a condition. It is a case of Conscience frequently put, and oft resolved by holy <HI>Brad∣ford, Peter Martyr, Philpot,</HI> and others in Queen <HI>Maries</HI> bloody dayes, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>Whether it was law∣ful to flee out of the Land?</HI> To which their an∣swer was, that if God gave a spirit of courage and willingness to glorifie him by Sufferings, they should stay; but if they found not such a spirit, they might lawfully fly; yea, they advised them thereunto. Those Servants of Christ, though full of the spirit of glory, and of Christ to outface the greatest persecuters in profession of the Truth, unto the death; yet did not complain of the cowardize of such as fled, because they deserted them &amp; the Cause; but rather advised divers so to do, and rejoy∣ced when God gave liberty to their brethren to escape with their lives to the places of liberty, to serve the Lord according to his
<PB N="35" REF="000773_0035_0FAA545D8BAFCE58"/>
Word. Neither were those faithful Saints and Servants of God useless and unprofitable in the Church of God that fled from the bloody Prelates. The infinite and only wise God hath many works to do in the World, and he doth by his singular Providence give gifts to his Servants, and disposeth them to his Work as seemeth best to himself. If the Lord will have some to bear witness by imprisonments, dismembring, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> we honour them therein; if he will have others instrumental to promote Reformation in <HI>England,</HI> we honour them, and rejoyce in their holy endeavours, praying for a blessing upon themselves and labours. And what if God will have his Church and the Kingdom of Christ go up also in these remote parts of the World, that his Name may be known to the Heathen, or whatsoever other end he hath, and to this end will send forth a company of weak hearted Christians, which dare not stay at home to suffer, why should we not let the Lord alone, &amp; rejoyce that Christ is Preached howsoever, &amp; wheresoever? And who can say that this work was not undertaken and carryed on with sincere and right ends, &amp; in an holy serious manner, by the chief, and the body of such as undertook the same? The Lord knows whether the sincere desires of wor∣shipping himself according to his will, of pro∣moting and propagating the Gospel, was not in
<PB N="36" REF="000773_0036_0FAA545E5A0627B8"/>
the hearts of very many in this Enterprise; &amp; he that seeth in secret, and rewardeth openly, knows what prayers &amp; tears have been poured out to God by many alone, and in dayes of Fasting and Prayer of Gods servants together, for his counsel, direction, assistance, blessing in this work: How many longings and pantings of heart have been in many after the Lord Je∣sus, to see his goings in his Sanctuary, as the one thing their Souls desired and requested of God, that they might dwell in his house for ever; the fruit of which prayers and desires this liberty of <HI>New England</HI> hath been taken to be, and thankfully received from God. Yea, how many serious consultations with one another, &amp; with the faithful Ministers, and other eminent servants of Christ, have been taken about this work, is not unknown to some; which clears us from any rash heady rushing into this place, out of discontent, as many are ready to con∣ceive. We will here say nothing of the per∣sons whose hearts the Lord stirred up in this business; surely all were not rash, weak spirited, inconsiderate of what they left behind, or of what it was to go into a Wilderness. But if it were well known and considered, or if we were able to express and recount the singular workings of divine Providence, for the bringing on of this Work, to what it is come unto, it would stop the mouths of all that have not an
<PB N="37" REF="000773_0037_0FAA545EBA4FE6F8"/>
heart to accuse and blaspheme the Goodness of God in his glorious Works. Whatever many may say or think, we believe after-times will admire and adore the Lord herein, when all his holy Ends, and the wayes he hath used to bring them about, shall appear. Look from one end of the heaven to another, whether the Lord hath assayed to do such a Work as this in any Nation, so to carry out a people of his own from so flourishing a State, to a wilder∣ness so far distant, for such ends, and for such a Work: Yea, and in few years hath done for them, as he hath here done for his poor des∣pised people. When we look back and consi∣der what a strange poise of spirit the Lord hath laid upon many of our hearts, we cannot but wonder at our selves, that so many, and some so weak and tender, with such cheerfulness and constant resolutions against so many perswasions of friends, discouragements from the ill report of this Country, the straits, wants and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vals of Gods people in it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet should leave our ac∣commodations &amp; comforts, should forsake our dearest Relations, Parents, Brethren, Sisters, Christian friends, and Acquaintances; over∣look all the dangers and difficulties of the vast Seas, the thought whereof was a terrour to ma∣ny; and all this to go to a Wilderness, where we could forecast nothing but care and temp∣tations; onely in hopes of enjoying Christ in
<PB N="38" REF="000773_0038_0FAA545F84C33918"/>
his Ordinances, in the fellowship of his people. Was this from a stupid senslesness or desperate carelesness what became of us or ours? or want of natural affections to our dear Country, or nearest Relations? No surely. With what bowels of compassion to our dear Country; with what heart-breaking affections, to our dear Relations, and Christian friends many of us, at least, came away, the Lord is witness. What shall we say of the singular Providence of God bringing so many Ship∣loads of his people, through so many dangers, as upon Eagles wings, with so much safety from year to year? The fatherly care of our God in feeding and cloathing so many in a Wilderness, giving such healthfulness and great increase of posterity? What shall we say of the Work it self of the kingdom of Christ? and the form of a Common-wealth erected in a Wilderness, and in so few years brought to that state, that scarce the like can be seen in any of our English Colonies in the richest places of this <HI>America,</HI> after many more years standing?
