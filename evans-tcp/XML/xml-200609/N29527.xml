<P>WHEREAS His Sacred Majesty in and by His Royal Proclamation of the Twenty fourth of February last, hath published His most pious Resolution to discountenance and punish all Vice, Immorality and Prophaneness, and to encourage and reward Virtue in all persons, from the highest to the lowest degree; Thereby setting a most rare and excellent Example to be viewed and followed by all His Subjects. Therefore being moved thereunto by the Assembly, and by, and with the Advice and Consent of the Council. I do direct and Command, all Iudges, Iustices of Peace, Grand-jurors, Constables, Tything-men, and all other Officers and Persons, in their respective Capacities, to do all that in them lies to detect discover, and bring forth all persons transgressing and offending against the wholesome Laws and Statutes made and provided for the Suppressing and punishing of Excessive Drinking, Blasphemy, prophane Swearing and Cursing, Lewdness, prophanation of the Lords Day, and other dissolute Immortal and disorderly practices; and to take effectual care, that the Laws made against such, be Vigorously put in Execution; as they tender the Honour of Almighty GOD, and the welfare, prosperity &amp; quiet of themselves and their Neighbourhood: And that by the piety and virtue of their own Lives &amp; Conversations, they do set good Examples, to incite others to a desirable Imitation thereof. Ordering that this Proclamation be Read in all Courts of Iustice within this Province, at the opening thereof, immediately before the charge be given to the Grand-jury.</P>
