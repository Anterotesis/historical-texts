<HEAD>TO GEORGE WASHINGTON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AMBITIOUS to avoid both the style and the sentiment of common dedica∣tion, more frequently the incense of adu∣lation, than the result of truth, I only ask the illustrious Washington to permit a lady of his acquaintance, to introduce to the public, under his patronage, a small volume, written as the amusement of solitude, at a period when every active member of society was engaged, either in the field, or the cab∣inet, to resist the strong hand of foreign domination.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="023035_0003_0FBAE103E27303F8"/>THE approbation of one who has united all hearts in the field of conquest, in the lap of peace, and at the head of the government of the United States, must, for a time, give countenance to a writer, who, claiming the honour of private friendship, hopes for this indulgence: But it must be a bold adven∣turer in the paths of literature, who dreams of fame, in any degree commensurate with the duration of laurels reaped by an hero, who has led the armies of America to glory, victory and independence.</P>
<P>THIS may, perhaps, be an improper place to make many observations on a revolution, that may eventually shake the proud sys∣tems of European despotism; yet you, sir, (who have borne such a distinguished and honourable part in the great conflict, till
<PB N="v" REF="023035_0004_0FBAE105AC225AE8"/>
the nations, wearied with slaughter, gave truce to the miseries of man) will permit me to observe, that, connected by consan∣guinity, or friendship, with many of the principal characters who asserted and de∣fended the rights of an injured country, the mind has been naturally led to contemplate the magnitude, both of the causes and the consequences, of a convulsion that has been felt from the eastern borders of the Atlantic, to the western wilds.</P>
<P>FEELING much for the distresses of America, in the dark days of her affliction, a faithful record has been kept, of the most material transactions, through a period that has engaged the attention, both of the phi∣losopher and the politician; and, if life is spared, a just trait of the most distinguished
<PB N="vi" REF="023035_0005_0FBAE106E883D380"/>
characters, either for valour, virtue, or pat∣riotism; for perfidy, intrigue, inconsistency, or ingratitude, shall be faithfully transmitted to posterity, by one, who unites in the gen∣eral wish, that you, sir, may continue to preside in the midst of your brethren, until nature asks the aid of retirement and re∣pose, to tranquilize the last stages of hu∣man life.</P>
<P>With every sentiment of esteem and friendship, I am, respected Sir,</P>

<HEAD>TO THE PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>ALMOST every page of the story of Rome, exhibits a tragedy, without the exaggeration of poetic fiction; yet there are few of its interesting scenes, that have not furnished the machinery for some dramatic work. But, amidst the innumer∣able writers, that almost every age has produced, the author of a piece, now offered the public, does not recollect to have seen the weakness and cruelty of <HI>Valentinian</HI>—the character of <HI>Petronius Maximus</HI>—the resentment, indiscretion and re∣venge of <HI>Edoxia</HI>—(the more immediate causes of the inva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the imperial city, by the Vandals)—chosen for the subject of theatrical instruction.</P>
<P>The subversion of the western empire, and the Sack of the city of Rome, by <HI>Genseric,</HI> form an era in the revolution of human affairs, that strikes the mind with peculiar solemnity: Perhaps, at that period, the character of man was sunk to the lowest stage of depravity. Debilitated by the habits of every species of luxury, a long series of tragical events, and the con∣tinual apprehensions of proscription, or death; the powers of
<PB N="10" REF="023035_0009_0FBAE11169AD8E40"/>
the mind were, at the same time, obscured by the superstitions of weak, uninformed christians, blended with the barbarisic and ignorance of the darker ages.</P>
<P>Thus an impenetrable closed was thrown over the religious and political institutions, both of the Roman and the Gothic world; which hastened on the destruction of the former, with∣out exhibiting any thing more honourable to the genius and vir∣tue of mankind, in the establishment of the latter; nor have more enlightened and polished ages been taught, by their ex∣amples, to shun the luxurious vices, or the absurd systems of policy, which have frequently corrupted, distracted, and ru∣ined the best constituted republics; as well as divided and overturned the strong fabric of monarchic government.</P>
<P>In tracing the rise, the character, the revolutions, and the full of the most politic and brave, the most insolent and selfish people, the world ever exhibited, the hero and the moralist may find the most sublime examples of valour and virtue; and the philosopher the most humiliating lessons to the pride of man, in the turpitude of some of their capital characters: While the extensive dominions of that once celebrated nation, their haugh∣ty
<PB N="11" REF="023035_0010_0FBAE1130E415678"/>
usurpations and splendid crimes, have for ages furnished the historian and the poet with a field of speculation, adapted to his own peculiar talents. But if the writer of the <HI>Sack of Rome</HI> has mistaken her's, she will, doubtless, be forgiven, as there have been instances of men of the best abilities who have fallen into the same error.</P>
<P>There is but little mixture of fable in the narration, and, I hope, a just purity of stile has been observed, while the writer has aimed at moral improvement, by an exhibition of the tu∣mult and misery into which mankind are often plunged by an unwarrantable indulgence of the discordant passions of the hu∣man mind.</P>
<P>Theatrical amusements may, sometimes, have been prostituted to the purposes of vice; yet, in an age of taste and refinement, lessons of morality, and the consequences of deviation, may per∣haps, be as successfully enforced from the stage, as by modes of instruction, less censured by the severe; while, at the same time, the exhibition of great historical events, opens a field of contemplation to the reflecting and philosophic mind.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="023035_0011_0FBAE11466701E50"/>My first wish is to throw a mite into the scale of virtue, and my highest ambition to meet the approbation of the judi∣cious and worthy:—In the one, I am gratified from the re∣flections of my own heart; for the other, I wait with diffi∣dence the determinations of the candid public.</P>

<PB REF="023035_0097_0FBAE1BA2BF2CB20"/>
<HEAD>To a <HI>YOUNG GENTLEMAN</HI> in <HI>EUROPE,</HI> at whose Request a regular <HI>DRAMATICK WORK</HI> was first attempted.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have often requested some∣thing in the stile of the drama, from the hand of one ever fond of gratifying her friends; though not certain whether this request arose from a love of literary pro∣ductions; from a curiosity that has affec∣tion for its basis; or the strong attachment of friendship; yet I have no doubt you will be pleased with the compliance.</P>
<P>I AM sensible the writing an unexcep∣tionable Tragedy, requires judgement, ge∣nius, and taste; and have felt such a diffi∣dence in the attempt, as nothing would have overcome but the repeated request of a very dear friend.</P>
<P>THOUGH the piece now put into your hand may not afford equal entertainment with the compositions of a Corneille, a Racine, or a Crebillon, yet I dare say, from your partiality, you will find pleasure in your closet, though it should not be <HI>en∣cored</HI> on the stage.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="023035_0098_0FBAE03EB5563490"/>YOU have never named me a subject, though you prohibited an American, and seemed to have no predilection in favour of British incident; therefore, notwithstanding events in the western world have outran imagination; notwithstanding the magni∣tude of prospect a rising empire displays, and the many tragical scenes exhibited on an island whence it derived its origin, I have recurred to an ancient story in the annals of Spain, in her last struggles for liberty, previous to the complete establishment of despotism by the family of Ferdinand.</P>
<P>THE history of Charles the fifth, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y∣ranny of his successors, and the exertions of the Spanish Cortes, will ever be interesting to an American ear, so long as they triumph in their independence, pride themselves in the principles that instigated their patriots, and glory in the characters of their heroes, whose valour completed a revolution that will be the wonder of ages.</P>
<P>WHAT a field for genius! What a dis∣play of capacity, both in science, in busi∣ness, and in politics, does this revolution ex∣hibit! Certainly, enough to fire the ambi∣tion, and light up every noble spark in the bosom of those who are in the morning of life.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="023035_0099_0FBAE0402A0DA3E8"/>THE nations have now reshe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thed the sword; the European world is hushed in peace; America stands alone:—May she long stand, independent of every foreign power; superiour to the spirit of intrigue, or the corrupt principles of usurpation that may spring from the successful exertions of her own sons:—May their conduct never contradict the professions of the patriots who have asserted the rights of human na∣ture; nor cause a blush to pervade the cheek of the children of the martyrs who have fallen in defence of the liberties of their country.</P>
<P>PERHAPS the subject I have chosen for the machinery of a tragedy, may be more proper for an epic, than a dramatic poem; yet I hope it will be acceptable in its pres∣ent garb, and that the candor of the public will be exercised, not so much for the sake of the sex, as the design of the writer, who wishes only to cultivate the sentiments of public and private virtue in whatsoever falls from her pen.</P>

<L>Ah!—whither do I rove—let me retire,</L>

<SPEAKER>FRANCIS.</SPEAKER>
<L>O might I claim that tender trickling tear,</L>

<L>Towards the field of fame, with fresh blown hope,</L>
<L>That ere tomorrow's sun engulphs his brow,</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOUISA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Velasco is to royalty alli'd,</L>
<L>A feudal lord, of ancient pedigree;</L>
<L>In rank, in wealth, in fame, the first in Spain;</L>
<L>His high swoln pride bursts forth in peals of rage,</L>
<L>Whene'er he talks or names the rebel chiefs;</L>
<L>Forbids his son to spare a single life,</L>
<L>If fortune makes him master of the field:—</L>
<L>Think then what agonies pervade my breast.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANCIS.</SPEAKER>
<L>When honour calls, and justice wields the sword,</L>
<L>True virtue spares, and clemency forgives;</L>
<L>But when a fierce, tyrannic lust of sway,</L>
<L>Deforms the soul, and blots out nature's stamp,</L>
<L>The wolf, or tyger, prowling for his prey,</L>
<L>Is less a savage than the monster man.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOUISA.</SPEAKER>
<L>No more, my lord—I sink beneath the storm;</L>
<L>The jarring passions tear my feeble frame—</L>
<L>My filial duties make the first demand;</L>
<L>Yet, spite of these, a group of passions rise,</L>
<L>Love—friendship—fear—compassion and despair,</L>
<L>Alternate rend, in spite of reason's sway.</L>
<L>Amidst the storm, the kind De Haro comes,</L>
<L>And with a smile, ineffably serene,</L>
<L>With all the softness of fraternal love,</L>
<L>He cries—forbear to think of me again,</L>
<L><PB N="123" REF="023035_0121_0FBAE06D1E999A58"/>Or that thy brother hazards fame or life,</L>

<L>Alas!—how weak my trembling heart's become—</L>
<L>Oh!—what has my unguarded tongue disclos'd!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANCIS.</SPEAKER>
<L>What makes me bless'd beyond the power of fate.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOUISA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Deception oft beneath a flimsy veil,</L>
<L>Hides human hearts, nor lets man know himself.</L>
<L>Should fortune snatch the victory from thee—</L>
<L>Thyself—thy friends—and freedom lost at once—</L>
<L>Perhaps you'll curse, in agonies of grief,</L>
<L>Louisa's house—her venerated sire—</L>
<L>Her noble brother—and yet more I dread—</L>

<L>This was the pledge of his Zelinda's faith:</L>

<L>In a fond moment of paternal love,</L>
<L>He kiss'd my cheek, and caught my trembling hand,</L>

<P>A young Gentleman educated in Europe, recommended to the Author's acquaintance, by a Friend of distinction.</P>

<L>WHEN ancient Britain pip'd the rustic lays,</L>

<L>The fair Salacia, victory, victory, sings,</L>

<L>(And though the Syrens left their coral beds,</L>
<L>Just o'er the surface lifted up their heads,</L>
<L>And sung soft peans to the brave and fair,</L>
<L>'Till almost caught in the delusive snare</L>
<L>To sink securely in a golden dream,</L>
<L>And taste the sweet inebriating stream,</L>
<L>Which, though a repast for the wat'ry maids,</L>
<L>Is baneful poison to the mountain naiades;)</L>
<L>They saw delighted from the inland rocks,</L>
<L>O'er the broad deep pour'd out Pandora's box;</L>
<L>They join'd, and fair Salacia's triumph sung,</L>
<L>Wild echo, o'er the bounding ocean rung;</L>
<L>The sea nymphs heard, and all the sportive train,</L>
<L>In shaggy tresses danc'd around the main,</L>
<L>From southern lakes, down to the northern rills,</L>
<L>And spread confusion round N— hills.</L>

<HEAD>To the Hon. J. WINTHROP, Esq.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Who, on the American Determination, in <HI>1774,</HI> to suspend all Commerce with Britain, (except for the real Necessaries of life) requested a poetical List of the Articles the Ladies might comprise under that Head.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<LG>
<L>FREEDOM may weep, and tyranny prevail,</L>
<L>And stubborn patriots either frown, or rail;</L>
<L>Let them of grave economy talk loud,</L>
<L>Prate prudent measures to the list'ning crowd;</L>
<L>With all the rhetoric of ancient schools,</L>
<L>Despise the mode, and fashion's modish fools;</L>
<L>Or shew fair liberty, who us'd to smile,</L>
<L>The guardian goddess of Britannia's isle,</L>
<L>In sable weeds, anticipate the blow,</L>
<L>Aim'd at Columbia by her royal foe;</L>
<L>And mark the period when inglorious kings</L>
<L>Deal round the curses that a Churchill sings.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But what's the anguish of whole towns in tears,</L>
<L>Or trembling cities groaning out their fears?</L>
<L>The state may totter on proud ruin's brink,</L>
<L>The sword be brandish'd, or the bark may sink;</L>
<L>Yet shall Clarissa check her wanton pride,</L>
<L>And lay her female ornaments aside?</L>
<L>Quit all the shining pomp, the gay parade,</L>
<L>The costly trappings that adorn the maid?</L>
<L>What! all the aid of foreign looms refuse!</L>
<L>(As beds of tulips strip'd of richest hues,</L>
<L>Or the sweet bloom that's nip'd by sudden frost,</L>
<L>Clarissa reigns no more a favorite toast.</L>
<L>For what is virtue, or the winning grace,</L>
<L>Of soft good humour, playing round the face;</L>
<L><PB N="209" REF="023035_0206_0FBADFE3E3EAC748"/>Or what those modest antiquated charms,</L>
<L>That lur'd a Brutus to a Portia's arms;</L>
<L>Or all the hidden beauties of the mind,</L>
<L>Compar'd with gauze, and tassels well combin'd?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This mighty theme produc'd a long debate,</L>
<L>On the best plan to save a sinking state;</L>
<L>The oratorial fair, as they inclin'd,</L>
<L>Freely discuss'd, and frankly spake their mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lamira wish'd that freedom might succeed,</L>
<L>But to such terms what female ere agreed?</L>
<L>To British marts forbidden to repair,</L>
<L>(Where ev'ry lux'ry tempts the blooming fair,)</L>
<L>Equals the rigour of those ancient times</L>
<L>When Pharaoh, harden'd as a G— in crimes,</L>
<L>Plagu'd Israel's race, and tax'd them by a law,</L>
<L>Demanding brick, when destitute of straw;</L>
<L>Miraculously led from Egypt's port,</L>
<L>They lov'd the fashions of the tyrant's court;</L>
<L>Sigh'd for the leeks, and waters of the Nile,</L>
<L>As we for gewgaws from Britannia's isle;</L>
<L>That haughty isle, whose mercenary hand,</L>
<L>Spreads wide confusion round this fertile land,</L>
<L>Destroys the concord, and breaks down the shrine,</L>
<L>By virtue rear'd, to harmony divine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Prudentia sigh'd—shall all our country mourn,</L>
<L>A powerful despot's low'ring, haughty frown,</L>
<L>Whose hostile mandates, sent from venal courts,</L>
<L>Rob the fair vintage, and blockade our ports;</L>
<L>While troops of guards are planted on each plain,</L>
<L>Whose crimes contagious, youth and beauty stain?</L>
<L>Fierce rancour blazen'd on each breast's display'd,</L>
<L>And for a crest, a gorgon's snaky head.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="210" REF="023035_0207_0FBADFE75428F708"/>
<L>The good, the wise, the prudent, and the gay,</L>
<L>Mingle their tears, and sighs for sighs repay;</L>
<L>Deep anxious thought each gen'rous bosom fills,</L>
<L>How to avert the dread approaching ills;</L>
<L>Let us resolve on a small sacrifice,</L>
<L>And in the pride of Roman matrons rise;</L>
<L>Good as Cornelia, or a Pompey's wife,</L>
<L>We'll quit the useless vanities of life.</L>
<L>Amidst loud discord, sadness, and dismay,</L>
<L>Hope spread her wing, and flit across the away:</L>
<L>Thanks to the sex, by heavenly hand design'd,</L>
<L>Either to bless, or ruin all mankind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A sharp debate ensu'd on wrong and right,</L>
<L>A little warm, 'tis true, yet all unite,</L>
<L>At once to end the great politic strife,</L>
<L>And yield up all but real wants of life.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But does Helvidius, vigilant and wise,</L>
<L>Call for a schedule, that may all comprise?</L>
<L>'Tis so contracted, that a Spartan sage,</L>
<L>Will sure applaud th' economizing age.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But if ye doubt, an inventory clear,</L>
<L>Of all she needs, Lamira offers here;</L>
<L>Nor does she fear a rigid Cato's frown,</L>
<L>When she lays by the rich embroider'd gown,</L>
<L>And modestly compounds for just enough—</L>
<L>Perhaps, some dozens of more slighty stuff;</L>
<L>With lawns and lustrings—blond, and mecklin laces,</L>
<L>Fringes and jewels, fans and tweezer cases;</L>
<L>Gay cloaks and hats, of every shape and size,</L>
<L>Scarfs, cardinals, and ribbons of all dyes;</L>
<L>With ruffles stamp'd, and aprons of tambour,</L>
<L>Tippets and handkerchiefs, at least, three score;</L>
<L><PB N="211" REF="023035_0208_0FBADFE8A7B2D780"/>With finest muslins that fair India boasts,</L>
<L>And the choice herbage from Chinesan coasts;</L>
<L>(But while the fragrant hyson leaf regales,</L>
<L>Who'll wear the homespun produce of the vales?</L>
<L>For if 'twould save the nation from the curse</L>
<L>Of standing troops; or, name a plague still worse,</L>
<L>Few can this choice delicious draught give up,</L>
<L>Though all Medea's poisons fill the cup.)</L>
<L>Add feathers, furs, rich sattins, and ducapes,</L>
<L>And head dresses in pyramidial shapes;</L>
<L>Side boards of plate, and porcelain profuse,</L>
<L>With fifty ditto's that the ladies use;</L>
<L>If my poor treach'rous memory has miss'd,</L>
<L>Ingenious T—l shall complete the list.</L>
<L>So week Lamira, and her wants so few,</L>
<L>Who can refuse?—they're but the sex's due.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In youth, indeed, an antiquated page,</L>
<L>Taught us the threatenings of an Hebrew sage</L>
<L>'Gainst wimples, mantles, curls, and crisping pins,</L>
<L>But rank not these among our modern sins:</L>
<L>For when our manners are well understood,</L>
<L>What in the scale is stomacher or hood?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Tis true, we love the courtly mein and air,</L>
<L>The pride of dress, and all the debonair;</L>
<L>Yet Clara quits the more dress'd negligee,</L>
<L>And substitutes the careless polanee;</L>
<L>Until some fair one from Britannia's court,</L>
<L>Some jaunty dress, or newer taste import;</L>
<L>This sweet temptation could not be withstood,</L>
<L>Though for the purchase's paid her father's blood;</L>
<L>Though loss of freedom were the costly price,</L>
<L>Or flaming comets sweep the angry skies;</L>
<L><PB N="212" REF="023035_0209_0FBADFE9E9518F78"/>Or earthquakes rattle, or volcanoes roar;</L>
<L>Indulge this trifle, and she asks no more:</L>
<L>Can the stern patriot Clara's suit deny?</L>
<L>'Tis beauty asks, and reason must comply.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But while the sex round folly's vortex play,</L>
<L>Say, if their lords are wiser far than they;</L>
<L>Few manly bosoms feel a nobler flame,</L>
<L>Some cog the dye, and others win the game;</L>
<L>Trace their meanders to their tainted source,</L>
<L>What's the grand pole star that directs their course?</L>
<L>Perhaps revenge, or some less glaring vice,</L>
<L>Their bold ambition, or their avarice,</L>
<L>Or vanity unmeaning, throw the bowl;</L>
<L>'Till pride and passion urge the narrow soul,</L>
<L>To claim the honours of that heavenly flame,</L>
<L>That warms the breast, and crowns the patriot's name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But though your wives in fripperies are dress'd,</L>
<L>And public virtue is the minion's jest,</L>
<L>America has many a worthy name,</L>
<L>Who shall, hereafter, grace the rolls of fame.</L>
<L>Her good Cornelias, and her Arrias fair,</L>
<L>Who, death, in its most hideous forms, can dare,</L>
<L>Rather than live vain fickle fortune's sport,</L>
<L>Amidst the panders of a tyrant's court;</L>
<L>With a long list of gen'rous, worthy men,</L>
<L>Who spurn the yoke, and servitude disdain;</L>
<L>Who nobly struggle in a vicious age,</L>
<L>To stem the torrent of despotic rage;</L>
<L>Who leagu'd, in solemn covenant unite,</L>
<L>And by the manes of good Hampden plight,</L>
<L>That while the surges lash Britannia's shore,</L>
<L>Or wild Ni'gara's cataracts shall roar,</L>
<L>And Heaven looks down, and sanctifies the deed,</L>
<L>They'll fight for freedom, and for virtue bleed.</L>

<HEAD>TO FIDELIO, Long absent on the great public Cause, which agitated all America, in <HI>1776.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE hill tops smile o'er all the blooming mead,</L>
<L>As I alone, on <HI>Clifford's</HI> summit tread;</L>
<L>Traverse the rural walks, the gurgling rills,</L>
<L>Survey the beauties of th' adjacent hills;</L>
<L>Taste the delights of competence and health,</L>
<L>Each sober pleasure reason lends to wealth:</L>
<L>Yet o'er the lawn a whisp'ring echo sighs,</L>
<L>Thy friend is absent—my fond heart replies—</L>
<L>Say—do not friendship's joys outweigh the whole?</L>
<L>'Tis social converse, animates the soul.</L>
<L>Thought interchang'd, the heavenly spark improves,</L>
<L>And reason brightens by the heart it loves;</L>
<L>While solitude sits brooding o'er her cares,</L>
<L>She oft accelerates the ills she fears;</L>
<L>And though fond hope with silken hand displays,</L>
<L>The distant images of halcyon days,</L>
<L>Her sable brow contracts a solemn air,</L>
<L>That treads too near the threshold of despair;</L>
<L>'Till heav'n benign the choicest blessings lend,</L>
<L>The balm of life, a kind and faithful friend:</L>
<L>This highest gift, by heav'n indulged, I claim;</L>
<L>Ask, what is happiness?—My friend, I name:</L>
<L>Yet while the state, by fierce internal war,</L>
<L>Shook to the centre, asks his zealous care,</L>
<L>I must submit, and smile in solitude,</L>
<L>My fond affection, my self love subdu'd:</L>
<L>The times demand exertions of the kind,</L>
<L>A patriot zeal must warm the female mind.</L>

<L>Yet, gentle hope!—come, spread thy silken wing,</L>

<L>May peace again erect her cheerful stand,</L>
<L>Disperse the ills which hover o'er the land;</L>

<HEAD>To a <HI>YOUNG GENTLEMAN,</HI> residing in FRANCE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE new year opes—the early morning dawns,</L>
<L>Broad sheets of silver dress the whiten'd lawns;</L>
<L>Bleak winter rises from the brindled north,</L>
<L>The tempest shakes, and furious blasts pour forth.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From nature's dawn, to nature's latest hour,</L>
<L>Each spangled leaf bespeaks creative pow'r;</L>
<L>The vernal dew drops, or autumnal breath,</L>
<L>That wraps the foliage in the arms of death;</L>
<L>The yew, the cypress, or the blooming rose,</L>
<L>India's long summer, or the Lapland snows,</L>
<L>Alike proclaim, what sceptic fools deny,</L>
<L>The soul's support—a providential eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This glorious truth my opening lids survey'd,</L>
<L>My grateful heart its early homage paid;</L>

<L>To find * * * on the Gallic shore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Long health, long peace, long happiness attend,"</L>
<L>The lovely youth, and bring me back my friend,</L>
<L>Unhurt, unshackled by the triple chains</L>
<L>Of folly, pride, or pleasure's guilty scenes.</L>
<L>When he has travell'd o'er from stage to stage,</L>
<L>The distant world, and read life's gaudy page,</L>
<L>Oh! may he quit th' illusive, airy chace,</L>
<L>And retrospect the happy path of peace.</L>
<L>True happiness consists in real worth,</L>
<L>And makes her exit when lost sight of truth;</L>
<L>The heaven born prize is not the gift of gold,</L>
<L>Of princes, statesmen, or whole countries sold;</L>
<L><PB N="222" REF="023035_0219_0FBADFFC10C19CA0"/>'Tis not the lap of luxury display'd</L>
<L>In all the spoils of innocence betray'd;</L>
<L>Nor will the smiles of witlings or of kings,</L>
<L>The laugh licentious of such motley things,</L>
<L>Give joy or peace to sterling worth or sense,</L>
<L>'Tis honest probity, with competence,</L>
<L>That calms the mind, and smooths the manly mein,</L>

<L>The herald's page, emblazoning high birth,</L>

<L>ON the smooth papyrus of ancient times,</L>
<L>Nature's bright charms, I'd paint in simple rhymes;</L>
<L>The bliss superiour of those happy days,</L>

<L>But, when immers'd amidst ten thousand cares,</L>

<L>I'll check my wish, and drop my humble wing,</L>
<L>Pleas'd with the laurels that for others spring:</L>
<L>Yet snatch a moment, when my friends command,</L>
<L>And point the period with a willing hand;</L>
<L>And if the lagging numbers slowly move,</L>
<L>I'll hope a pardon from the voice of love.</L>
<L>Critics may censure, but if candour frowns,</L>
<L>I'll quit the pen, and keep within the bounds,</L>
<L>The narrow bounds, prescrib'd to female life,</L>
<L>The gentle mistress, and the prudent wife:</L>
<L>Maternal precepts, drawn from sacred truth,</L>
<L>Shall warm the bosom of the list'ning youth;</L>

<L>And the shrill echo o'er the vale rebounds;</L>
<L>The distant nations hear the dread alarm,</L>
<L>Enkindled Europe for the conflict arm;</L>
<L>The Gallic powers, the western peasants join,</L>
<L>And distant legions form in freedom's line;</L>
<L>America is hail'd from sea to sea,</L>
<L>Sits independent, glorious, and free;</L>
<L>Propitious heaven approv'd, and smil'd benign,</L>
<L>And guards of angels aided her design;</L>
<L>While still her senate, vigilant and wise,</L>
<L>Spreads wide her fame, and lifts her to the skies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But he who holds the universal chain</L>
<L>Of all events, his system will maintain;</L>
<L>He through the whole creation has decreed,</L>
<L>Effects must follow as our actions lead;</L>
<L>All nature shews that heaven ne'er design'd,</L>
<L>Spite of themselves, to save and bless mankind.</L>
<L>The friendly genius lifted slow her veil,</L>
<L>And still hid half the melancholy tale—</L>
<L>When, lo! she sigh'd, the happy prospect dies,</L>
<L>Guilt has provok'd the vengeance of the skies;</L>
<L>As wealth pour'd in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>om every distant shore,</L>
<L>The gaudy lap of luxury ran o'er;</L>
<L>The blacken'd passions all at once let loose,</L>
<L>And rampant crimes scarce ask'd for an excuse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So dissolute—yet so polite the town,</L>
<L>Like Hogarth's days, the world's turn'd upside down;</L>
<L>Old Juvenal, who censur'd former crimes,</L>
<L>Or Churchill's pen, in more satiric rhymes,</L>
<L>Or crabbed Swift, in yet a rougher stile,</L>
<L>Might lash the vices of a venal isle;</L>
<L><PB N="249" REF="023035_0246_0FBAE0365CE3CC38"/>If sermons, satires, or the law of heaven,</L>
<L>(Though it again from Sinai's mount were given,)</L>
<L>Should all combine to censure modish vice,</L>
<L>It can't be wrong, when fashion sanctifies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hogarth <HI>might</HI> paint, and Churchill lash the times,</L>

<L>The life in vogue may ample room afford.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This piece was written when a most remarkable depravity of manners pervaded the cities of the United States, in consequence of a state of war; a relaxation of government; the sudden acquisition of fortune; a depreciating currency; and a new intercourse with foreign nations.</NOTE></L>

<L>The early creed of lisping girls and boys,</L>
<L>Is taste, high life, and pleasure's guilty joys;</L>
<L>The modish stile the heedless parent taught,</L>
<L>And sins run rank, from levity of thought;</L>
<L>Ere the big cloud that shook the north retires,</L>
<L>Each generous movement of the soul expires;</L>
<L>All public faith, and private justice dead,</L>
<L>And patriot zeal by patriots betray'd;</L>
<L>While hot bed plants of yesterday shoot up,</L>
<L>Erect their heads, and reach the cedar's top.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thankless to heaven, and to the men ingrate,</L>
<L>Who ventur'd all to save a sinking state;</L>
<L>Who kept the shatter'd bark, and stood the deck,</L>
<L>When timid he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>smen left her as a wreck.</L>
<L>Those godlike men, those lovers of mankind,</L>
<L>Have nought to retrospect that pains the mind;</L>
<L><PB N="250" REF="023035_0247_0FBAE03737FB44B0"/>Placid they move amidst an heedless band,</L>
<L>And sigh in silence o'er a guilty land.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But when old Time is so decrepid grown,</L>
<L>His worn out car no more will bear him on,</L>
<L>When Fame throws by her faithless tinkling tube</L>
<L>That carol'd falsehoods round the list'ning globe,</L>
<L>The evergreens on yonder ether plains,</L>
<L>Eternal flourish to reward their pains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus truth exhibits virtue in an age,</L>
<L>When vice, unblushing, stalk'd across the stage,</L>
<L>And star'd around with hideous prowling eyes,</L>
<L>To catch the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eedless witling as he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ies;</L>
<L>The disputant, who enters on the lift,</L>
<L>To foil a Newton, or to win at whist.</L>
<L>He lives a sceptic, if you take his word,</L>
<L>Thinks 'tis heroic to deny his God,</L>
<L>Or to dispute his providential care;</L>
<L>Deride his precepts, or to scoff at prayer.</L>
<L>His coat, his creed, his faith and genius too,</L>
<L>Are moderniz'd as fashion forms the cue;</L>
<L>Prompt and alert, with erudition fraught,</L>
<L>Than Locke, or Boyle, in ethics better taught;</L>
<L>He swears the <HI>taste</HI> the <HI>bon ton</HI> of the times,</L>
<L>By moralists can ne'er be constru'd crimes;</L>
<L>Most modern writers are much better bred,</L>
<L>Voltaire and Hoyle, the authors he has read,</L>
<L>Discard such antique, odd ideas of truth,</L>
<L>Such musty rules for regulating youth.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lord Bolingbroke, among the wits a toast,</L>
<L>And Mandeville, the sceptic's empty boast,</L>
<L>Reason so clear, that e'en their pigmy race</L>

<L>Virtue is an enthusiastic dream,</L>

<LG>
<L>At bacchanalian feasts, it is the mode</L>
<L>To pour libations to the red ey'd God,</L>
<L>'Till penetration so out runs his sense,</L>
<L>That the <HI>arcana</HI> of omnipotence,</L>

<L>On Voltaire's creed—or the decrees of <HI>fate</HI>;</L>
<L>'Till graceful * * so improves the plan,</L>
<L>The deist blushes at his bolder strain;</L>
<L>His flowing stile, and easy periods such,</L>
<L>His influence sinks, because he doubts too much.</L>
<L>This smooth romantic bard, from east to west,</L>
<L>Has conjur'd up each sceptical protest</L>
<L>'Gainst all religion—ev'n the most sublime,</L>
<L>Oral or wrote—of late or modern time.</L>
<L>All hope renounc'd of an immortal state,</L>
<L>By rote his pupils syllogisms prate—</L>
<L><HI>Annihilation</HI> dissipates all fear,</L>
<L>We can but suffer—and enjoy while here.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As <HI>ignis fatuus</HI> floats from lake to bog,</L>
<L>The vapor plays in pestilential fog,</L>
<L>Sparkles and sinks in the dark marshy tomb,</L>
<L>As modern wits in metaphysic fume.</L>
