<L>To roam from land to land, from pole to pole;</L>
<L>To soar beyond the sun, to worlds on high▪</L>
<L>Which roll in millions round th' unmeasur'd sky;</L>
<L>To mark the comet thro' his pathless ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</L>

<L>"Her nobler Sister too shall charm the mind</L>
<L>With moral raptures and with truths refin'd;</L>
<L>Religion lead whole realms to worlds of joy,</L>

<L>"See Hist'ry all the scenes of time unveil</L>

<L>And stretch their sway to regions yet unknown!"</L>
<L>"See all the powers of Poetry unite</L>
<L>To paint Religion's charms divinely bright;</L>
<L>To sing his name, who made you orbs of fire,</L>
<L>Spread out the sky and form'd th' angelic choir:</L>
<L>Seraphs themselves inspire the sacred lays,</L>
<L>And stoop from heaven to hear their Maker's praise!"</L>
<L>"See Sculpture mould the rude unpolish'd stone,</L>
<L>Give it new forms and beauties not its own;</L>
<L>Bid the gay marble leap to life and breath,</L>
<L>And call up heroes from the realms of Death!"</L>

<L>No more on earth shall Rage and Discord dwell,</L>

<L>Th' Almighty Saviour his great power display</L>
<L>From rising morning to the setting day;</L>
<L>Love reign triumphant, Fraud and Malice cease,</L>
<L>And every region smile in endless peace:</L>
<L>Till the last trump the slumbering dead inspire,</L>
<L>Shake the wide heavens, and set the world on fire;</L>
<L>Thron'd on a flaming cloud, with brightness crown'd,</L>
<L>The Judge descend, and angels shine around,</L>
<L>The mountains melt, the moon and stars decay,</L>
<L>The sun grow dim, and Nature roll away;</L>
<L>GOD's happy children mount to worlds above,</L>
<L>Drink streams of purest joy and taste immortal love."</L>
