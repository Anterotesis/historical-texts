<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE subject of the following Tragedy, which has never been acted or published, is purely fabulous. It has human nature, but no particular nation, or individual, for its ob∣ject. The author thinks this declaration neces∣sary, as it may prevent malignant criticism from imputing sentiments to him, which he abhors. He wishes to be thought, however ob∣scure, an advocate for liberty, on the most enlarged and liberal plan; but he is warrant∣ed, by history, in affirming, that true liberty may as effectually be destroyed by the machina∣tions of a party, as by the ambition of a single person. An aristocracy appears to him to be the most odious and oppressive of all modes of government, nor is it destroyed without the greatest difficulty; for that monster has many heads.</HI></P>
<P><HI>May the Citizens of this State continue to prize the generous system of liberty, which their virtue has established! As they have bravely repelled foreign usurpation, may they with equal success prevent domestic encroachment! Thus shall they not at some distant period, be com∣pelled to fly for refuge to monarchy, from a turbulent, oppressive and tyrannical aristocracy.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>OTANES.</SPEAKER>
<L>'TWAS weak; 'twas wrong; this turbulence forebodes</L>
<L>Some greater evil, and the King may soon</L>
<L>Repent his tame compliance.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ADRASTUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>You are warm.</L>
<L>Your zeal, Otanes, hurries you beyond</L>
<L>The bounds of reason; but the people's voice,</L>
<L>The voice of millions in so just a cause,</L>
<L>Demands the monarch's ear, and should enforce</L>
<L>Conviction.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OTANES.</SPEAKER>
<L>Much I fear, their factious clamors</L>
<L>Will gain upon the easy King to grant</L>
<L>More insolent demands; then may we see</L>
<L>The sceptre wrested from the feeble hand</L>
<L>Of flexile majesty.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="018571_0005_0FA7AD2F7983B970"/>
<SPEAKER>ADRASTUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>You wrong the people.</L>
<L>They idolize their King; his better years,</L>
<L>They know, were spent amidst the rage of war,</L>
<L>To save them from the hated Persian yoke.</L>
<L>Heaven crown'd his valor with success, and now,</L>
<L>With filial piety and veneration,</L>
<L>They view his sacred head, hoary with age,</L>
<L>And bending with the weight of public cares</L>
<L>For Lydia's safety.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OTANES.</SPEAKER>
<L>Slightly they regard</L>
<L>His cares and valor; and for wealth and freedom</L>
<L>Repay him with the insolence of faction.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ADRASTUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Long since has Lydia graced with full reward</L>
<L>The actions of her chief; with fame, respect,</L>
<L>Obedience and a crown. Think not, I speak</L>
<L>With democratic zeal; with sacred awe</L>
<L>I venerate the hand, that sways the sceptre,</L>
<L>And bow before the delegate of Heaven.</L>
<L>His country's love, not wild ambition, rouz'd</L>
<L>His matchless valor; when the Persian fled,</L>
<L>And freedom, the reward of public virtue,</L>
<L>Benignly smil'd again, the warrior sought</L>
<L>His lov'd domestic ease, as if he scorn'd</L>
<L>That sceptre, which the fates had destin'd for him.</L>
<L>But Lydia, urg'd by civil discontent,</L>
<L>And mindful of her hero's long-tried worth,</L>
<L>Plac'd him reluctant on the throne, and grac'd</L>
<L>His honour'd brows with glory nobly earn'd.</L>
<L>And shall that people, whose all-giving hand</L>
<L>Whose matchless bounty—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OTANES.</SPEAKER>
<L>Spare that argument;</L>
<L>I feel its utmost force. But grant, a King,</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="018571_0006_0FA7AD3037865330"/>
Best in his subjects' love, and fully warm'd</L>
<L>With grateful sentiments, to their desires</L>
<L>Should sacrifice his will, why should the people</L>
<L>Controul the father, and invade a right</L>
<L>The meanest hind enjoys. You know the cares,</L>
<L>That wring his aged heart and bow him down</L>
<L>More than the weight of years; the ills, that threaten</L>
<L>His son, his lov'd Olinthus.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ADRASTUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>I have heard</L>
<L>The tale confusedly; but the Gods will never</L>
<L>Desert their image; virtue is their care,</L>
<L>And Dorus claims their patronage; his sun,</L>
<L>Which in its zenith shone with so much lustre,</L>
<L>Must set serene, unsullied with a cloud.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OTANES.</SPEAKER>
<L>I doubt it much. (<HI>aside.</HI>) Hard were their hearts indeed,</L>
<L>Who could, unmoved, behold the tears stream down</L>
<L>His furrow'd cheeks, whilst all in vain he pleaded</L>
<L>His former services, his present cares.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ADRASTUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Never, Otanes, shall we see again</L>
<L>So great a scene. The King is more than man.</L>
<L>He felt as man; but like a God resolv'd.</L>
<L>Soon as the rays of truth dispell'd the mist</L>
<L>Of weak paternal love, his frame grew larger,</L>
<L>As if some heavenly impulse swell'd his bosom.</L>
<L>His sparkling eyes shone with unequall'd lustre;</L>
<L>His voice imprinted awe; but when he bent</L>
<L>His knees, and rais'd his trembling hands to Heaven,</L>
<L>Imploring Jove to guide his wandering steps</L>
<L>Thro' the dark labyrinth of dreaded woes,</L>
<L>I melted, wept—They were not tears of sorrow;,</L>
<L>No, they were tears of joy, and, might I say it,</L>
<L>Of adoration.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="018571_0007_0FA7AD30F4CD6CF0"/>
<SPEAKER>OTANES.</SPEAKER>
<L>Still my heart forebodes,</L>
<L>Some sad disaster threats his close of life.</L>
<L>Hast thou not heard, that awful prodigies</L>
<L>Alarm the priests and awe the trembling city.</L>
<L>When they led forth, in all the pomp of prayer,</L>
<L>The sacrifice for Dorus' life and safety,</L>
<L>Th' ungovern'd victim rush'd among the crowd,</L>
<L>Fled thro' the streets, and with unequall'd swift∣ness,</L>
<L>Travers'd the plain, and has not since been seen.</L>
<L>In great Cybele's fane strange sounds were heard,</L>
<L>Like dying infants' cries, as if again</L>
<L>Old Saturn cruelly prepar'd to feast</L>
<L>On his own offspring. Every cheek is pale</L>
<L>With gloomy apprehension, and the priests</L>
<L>Tremble with sacred horror.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ADRASTUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>To the Gods</L>
<L>Let us, Otanes, leave th' accomplishment</L>
<L>Of their decrees. It ill befits frail man,</L>
<L>To strive, with feeble eyes, to pierce the cloud</L>
<L>Of dark futurity. The Gods must crown</L>
<L>The virtuous man with never-fading bliss.</L>
<L>To check the haughty, to exalt the good,</L>
<L>But chiefly to instruct his son to rise</L>
<L>By the same steps to equal heights of virtue,</L>
<L>These should be Dorus' cares: Futurity</L>
<L>Belongs to Heaven.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OTANES.</SPEAKER>
<L> The People seem to dread</L>
<L>A war impending.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ADRASTUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>They judge right, Otanes.</L>
<L>The Persian views our happy state with envy,</L>
<L>And meditates new chains.</L>

<L>And the King's smile. But could I see the Prince,</L>

<L>(<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> then was young) the Persians saw his sword</L>

<L>The prudent plan design'd by sober age.</L>
<L>Love is the cordial drop, which sweetens life,</L>

<L>Are these my promis'd joys?</L>
<L>And is it thus I meet thee? Yet even this</L>
<L>Affords some comfort; no dishonor stain'd</L>
<L>His blooming youth, nor was his father doom'd</L>
<L>To see him perish by his cruel sentence.</L>
<L>Ye see me, Gods! oppress'd with age and woe,</L>
<L>A weak, deserted wretch; my offspring slain,</L>
<L>My friend a traitor; yet I meet your wrath</L>
<L>With patient grief, and bow beneath the stroke.</L>
<L>Be merciful and grant an old man's prayer.</L>
<L>O take the wretched father with the son,</L>
<L><PB N="64" REF="018571_0067_0FA7ABFA28885BA8"/>

<L>My tongue, then tears and oaths lull'd all suspicion</L>
<L>Strike, strike, thou once blest father; take a great,</L>

<L>Thy only son, now punish him in me.</L>

<L>Hold, rash youth! unjust Araspes! stay</L>
<L>Thy cruel hand; has not the blood of Dorus</L>
<L>Already flow'd in copious streams? Wilt thou</L>
<L>Encrease my woes? Thy life is not thy own.</L>
<L>Thy friends, the King, thy future people claim it.</L>
<L>The Gods heap sorrows on us, but they give us</L>
<L>Patience to bear and fortitude to live.</L>
<L>Despair and rashness are the weak mind's refuge.</L>

<L>My father, since that tender name is thine,</L>

<L>I ne'er conspir'd against thy life or crown,</L>
