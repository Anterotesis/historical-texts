<HEAD>NEW YEAR VERSES, Addressed to those Gentlemen who have been pleased to favour <HI>Francis Wrigley,</HI> News Car∣rier, with their Custom. <HI>JANUARY</HI> 1, 1783.</HEAD>

<L><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Times have been hard, and our Commerce gone wrong,</L>
<L>We still have been able to struggle along.</L>
<L>If some, thro' Misfortunes, are slack in the Purse,</L>
<L>It is not so bad but it might have been worse.</L>
<L>Great Things, the Year past, were reveal'd to our Eyes:</L>
<L>The Dutch have confess'd us their Friends and Allies,</L>
<L>And humbled the Pride of our haughty Invaders,</L>
<L>By fighting their Fleets and destroying their Traders.</L>
<L>If the English succeeded in taking the COUNT,</L>
<L>To what, in the End, did their Conquest amount?</L>
<L>With their Boasts, and their Brags, and their Shouts of Applause,</L>
<L>It but sav'd them from Ruin,—not ruin'd our Cause.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But leaving the Weight of political Cares</L>
<L>To those, who are plac'd at the Helm of Affairs,</L>
<L>To the Humours of Fortune in all Things resign'd,</L>
<L>I mean by my Visit to put you in Mind,</L>
<L>That, as true as a Clock, both early and late,</L>
<L>With the News of the Day I have knock'd at your Gate,</L>
<L>And gave you to know what the World was a-doing,</L>
<L>What LOUIS intended, or GEORGE was a-brewing.</L>
<L>If sometimes the Papers were trifling and flat,</L>
<L>And the News went against us,—I cou'dn't help that;</L>
<L>If Parties were angry, and vented their Spite,</L>
<L>I bro't you their Wranglings,—not help'd them to write.</L>
<L>I therefore presume (and not without Reason)</L>
<L>You'll remember your NEWSMAN, and think of the Season;</L>
<L>The Markets are high, and the Weather is cold;</L>
<L>No <HI>Party</HI> I serve, and no <HI>Pension</HI> I hold.</L>
<L>We Hawkers are Men, and have Children and Wives</L>
<L>To comfort our Hearts and to solace our Lives:</L>
<L>But if I say more, you'll think it is Stuff;</L>
<L>And <HI>a Word to the Wise is,</HI> in Reason, <HI>enough.</HI></L>
