<HEAD>A JOURNAL, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>MY honored father lived in Brookfield, in Massa∣chusetts, and engaged in the American army in the first year of the late war, at Roxbury, and died the same year, 1775.</P>
<P>Being about the age of nineteen years, I enlisted un∣der Ensign JOHN TILLINGHAST, of Providence, so an expedition against the Indians in the year 1791. When the period arrived when I must quit my home, orders were received for a part of the soldiers, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> twenty-eight in all, to embark on board a vessel des∣tined to convey us towards the Western country, in which we went as far as New Brunswick, under the command of Lieut. SHEARMAN. On our passage to New-Brunswick we had bad weather, though we arrived there in ten days; we remained there about five days, and then being equiped with our guns and accoutre∣ments, we marched towards Pittsburgh. The weather was exceeding hot, which made our journey very te∣dious. We arrived at Pittsburgh sometime in August; where Lieut. SHEARMAN religned and went home; and Ensign BALCH, of Boston, took the command of the detachment, to Head-Quarters. We remained there about three weeks, and then we received orders to go down the Ohio River. The boats we went down in were of two inch plank of white oak; the length of them was about forty feet, and about sixteen feet wide, and they rowed with four oars, and three men at each oar, and over the top of the boats there was a roof like the roof of a building, for a defence against the Indians firing from the shore; though one night we received several shot from them, but there was no man hurt; and so we continued our route night and day, until we arrived at FORT WASHINGTON, where we joined the main army. which consisted of about two thousand men; and we remained there about two weeks. Then we received orders to match for the Miamis,
<PB N="4" REF="030135_0004_0FE49F08420E3308"/>
about twenty-five miles, and there make another halt, and build a fort, which is called Fort Hamilton, and the main army repaired to said fort; but I was ordered another way, on command; first going twenty miles down the Ohio River, and then entered into another small river called Big Miamis, that leads to Fort Ha∣milton. From thence we advanced about forty miles further; this command was under Ensign COBB, of Taunton, and Serjeant HOLLY, of Rhode-Island, and consisted of a corporal and twenty-four privates, which went to guard a boat load of provisions round by wa∣ter. This boat drew about eighteen inches of water, but the river being lower than we were aware of, we were obliged to draw the boat by main strength in pla∣ces of fifty and an hundred yards at a time, in eight or ten inches of water, which caused us to be eight days on that passage. On the fifth day at night, we en∣camped on the banks of the river, all except the boats∣men, who said they would sleep under the banks of the river by the boat, which they did. We kept the guard on the bank of said river for fear of the Indians; and just at day light one of the guard looked down the banks and cried out, there are Indians! he had no soonet spoke than the Indians fired at the boatmen under the bank of the river; and as the men rose up, there was a ball struck the bushes about six inches off, above <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> heads; but as it happened there was no man hurt. We were all immediately alarmed. A small party went in pursuit of them, and got sight of the Indians, who were on horses, and fired at them: on our firing at them they dropped their packs, and some skins, and several trifling things, which they had stole from the inhabitants the night before, which we got; one of the balls struck an Indian on his rump, but his stooping forward on his horse prevented his being much hurt, but cut his blanket from his rump to his shoulders; for after I was taken by the Indians, I sound out that my master was there at that time, though I never dare let him know that I was in that party, but he often told me how nigh one of the Indians came being shot. The horses they had stolen out of Judge Simmons's stable, about twelve miles below Fort Washington, and they were pursued so close, and our firing open them gave them a fright, and they went several miles back on the
<PB N="5" REF="030135_0005_0FE49F0AD7148DD8"/>
same way they came, which gave the party a chance to come up with them, which they did, and pursued them so close through the swamp that the inhabitants got their horses again; but the Indians made their es∣cape, and got off.</P>
<P>We moved on our way with our boats, but the water being so low we made a very poor hand of getting along with it, though we went about nine miles that day; and at night we encamped upon as clear a place as we could find, for fear of the Indians coming upon us: and there was a guard of a serjeant and a corporal, and nine privates, and two sentinels stood at some distance from the camp, to keep watch that no Indians came upon us unknown. But about ten o'clock in the evening, some Indians came creeping up to the fire, but the sentinels fired upon them, which alarmed the whole party; we immediately brought water from the river and put out the fire, and every man took to a tree, and stood in that situation until morning. The Indians kept creeping round, and we exchanged several shot with them that night; but it being very dark there was no man hurt; and when it was day-light we went into our boat, and moved on our way, but we had not gone more than half a mile, when looking back we saw three Indians upon the shore where we had encamped, but being very much fa∣tigued, we kept on our way and took no notice of them; and on that day about three o'clock in the af∣ternoon we arrived at a small garrison called DUNLAP'S STATION, which was about sixteen miles from the place of our destination, but we were obliged to leave our boat by reason of the lowness of the water.</P>
<P>We remained there about two days, then we went through the bush about ten miles, and came to the ar∣my, and there we remained until FORT HAMILTON was finished, and then we received orders to march for the Maumee towns, leaving about forty men to keep the garrison. The road we went we had to cut and clear as we travelled, day by day, which made our journey very tedious, for we could go but six or seven miles a day. We went on our march until we had got about forty-five miles, and then we built another fort, that is called FORT JEFFERSON; and alter we had been building said fort about three days, I happened to be on the our-side
<PB N="6" REF="030135_0006_0FE49F13F16E7AE0"/>
picket guard at night. The next morning there were three of the guard and myself, not having any duty to do, obtained liberty of our officers to go half a mile distance a hunting, being very scant of provisions; and after we had passed the sentinels, we parted, and agreed to take a small circle and then to meet upon a plain, and I went to the right hand, and coming round a swamp in a blind foot path, a little distance from the plain, looking out for some game, not thinking of any danger, on coming into a thicket of brush, there rose up three Indians, which you may think not a little sur∣prised me, I looked this way and that way for a place to run, but found it impracticable, for there were Indians on every side with their tomahawks over my head, so I saw that I might as well give up as to make any resis∣tance, dropping my firelock, and putting out my hand to shake with them, they shook hands with me, and bid me make haste, and then they took me through a swamp upon a dry ridge, and sat down for about an hour, and then went on again, and travelled until about twelve o'clock; then one of them gave a most hideous halloo, which made the woods ring again, and one of the Indians told me by and by I would see plenty of Indians, and in about half an hour one of them gave another halloo, and a quarter of a mile forward it seem∣ed as though the woods were alive with Indians, and directly there came about twenty Indians running to meet us, some with knives and some with tomahawks, and painted so they looked more like so many evil spirits than any thing else. I thought then my life was short, but they all came and shook hands with me, ex∣cept three or four of them, who looked very surly at me, and two of them took hold of me and led me into a thick miry swamp, and came upon a little dry nole in the middle of the swamp, where they had had a fire about six days, watching the army; but no sooner than I had got to the fire than one took off my hat, another my coat, and another my waistcoat, another my shoes, and one stript me of my shirt and gave me an old one in lieu of it, which was very dirty; they then brought me an Indian who could speak English, and began to examine me to know what condition the army was in, I told them as good a story as I could, as I saw they were upon the catch, I made as few words answer as I
<PB N="7" REF="030135_0007_0FE49F158317A810"/>
could; and after they had examined me as much as they thought proper, one of them went and brought me some roasted venison, and a piece of bear's meat; and after I had eaten as much as I wanted, though I had not much appetite to eat, they asked me if I could run fast, I told them I could not; they then told me I must run or die immediately. Then they packed up their things and set out toward the Maumee town.</P>
<P>When they first set out from the camp they spread themselves every way, so that no man could know which way they went, and after they had gone about one mile that way, they came together again; and after they came together again the second time, they gave me a pack of meal and some skins about the weight of a bushel of corn; and then one Indian went forward, and they set me next, and the rest of the Indians fol∣lowed after, hurrying me on, keeping me on the trot all the afternoon, until just night, then one of them told me to run, I told him I could not run, for I was very weary; I had no sooner spoke than one of the Indians struck me on the back of the head with the breech of his gun, which knocked me down to the ground, but I soon recovered and got up again, then I saw that I must run, though I was hardly able to walk, yet was obliged to run, and we went on that way until dusk of the evening. Then one of the Indians took me and lead me about half a mile from the path into a swamp, and the rest of the Indians went with him, and went to making a fire; but my master took me and set down about two rods from the fire, and asked me how I should like to be tied, I told him I should not like to be tied at all, but he said I must be tied or may be I should run away; then he took a parcel of cords, and tied me, he first tied my elbows behind me, and my hands toge∣ther forward, and then drew a moggasin over each hand, and tied them both together down to the waistband of my breeches, and then laid me on my back, and tied a cord round my neck, and another round my legs, and tied them fast to a tree; and the Indians lay aside me across the cords. I lay in this condition until morning, and it may well be thought that I underwent a great deal that night, for I was tied in such a manner that I could not stir hand nor foot, neither had I any thing to cover me but the heavens, for they never gave me so
<PB N="8" REF="030135_0008_0FE49F1711CB4C40"/>
much as a blanket to put over me, though it snowed and rained; and in the morning when they untied me, I was so stiff with the cold I could not stand, but I rolled over the ground and rubbed myself awhile, and set by the fire, till I got so that I could go; then making themselves ready, moved on their way to town again. When they had travelled about three or four miles they made a halt for about half an hour, then one of the Indians came and painted me black, and painted themselves black likewise; but not knowing the meaning of being painted in such a sort, I thought it was done for their own diversion. But they im∣mediately went on their way, until about ten o'clock in the forenoon, then making another stand, which had like to have been my last, they first spotted the trees around for some distance, and then made blacking of powder and marked the trees in all kinds of disfigured creatures. Then they came round and began to make a speech, and the Indian that painted me, told me to get up. Now my master had gone in pursuit of a deer, and was not with the rest of the company. In the mean time, while they were cutting their capers over me, my master came up and looked angry at them, and in a great rage, and made a long speech to them, which seemed to displease many of them, but they soon took up their packs and was for marching on. Now I was to have been tomahawked here, but I knew no∣thing of it until after I was brought to the Maumee town; and my master coming up at that time, was the means of saving my life. But we had not gone far from this place, when the Indian that was the means of sa∣ving my life told me to wash off the black that was on my face, which he said was no good, which I immedi∣ately did, and then he painted my face red, which was a token that I was not to die. We went on the re∣mainder of the day, and at night when we encamped, they bound me as they did before, which I thought was very hard usage, to travel all day, and at night be bound in such a manner. But on the third day, about four o'clock, we arrived at the Maumee town; but when we had got within about two miles of said town, the Indians made a halt, and my master painted my face one half red and the other part black, and then tied a
<PB N="9" REF="030135_0009_0FE49F189FC19BB0"/>
large rope round my neck, which hung to my waist; then he took my pack from me, and one of the Indians that could speak English told me by and by I should come into town; and he farther said, perhaps when you get into the town, some saucy boys will come out and strike you, and if they do, you will see a long house, and you must run to that house and sit down, and they will strike you no more, which I found to be true: for when we had got within about half a mile of the town, one of the Indians gave a loud halloo, and it seemed as though the woods were alive with Indians for a mile round; and immediately the savages came running to meet us as thick as the squirrels in the woods, which I thought the most frightful sight I ever beheld; but di∣rectly we came into the town, and as we passed the first camp there came out a young Indian warrior, and struck me on the back of my neck, and I fell to the ground; and when I recovered on my knees, another gave me a kick, and kicked me on my face, and as soon as I got up another Indian caught me by the hand and said run, run, you devil! and as I run he struck me over the face and eyes; and when I had got within an hun∣dred yards of the long house which the Indian told me of the path on both sides was paraded with Indians, as many as could stand; and as I run through, every one of them gave me a blow, some with their hand and some with a club, and others a kick with the foot, but every one would have a blow at me; so that when I got to the house, my face was as bloody as though I had dipped my head in blood, be∣sides other bruises all over my body. Just as I got to the door, and was going in, one of the Indians hit me on the side of the head and sent me past the corner of the house; but I scrambled up again and went into the house, and as soon as I entered the door I met an old grey-headed chief, and shook hands with him, but I was so grieved with such usage, that I could not re∣frain shedding tears, which I think almost every one would have done, but he said you must not cry, for if you do the Indians will kill you; but I sat down, and immediately they brought me a white man to examine me, which he did very closely, concerning the army, and what situation they were in, though I made my story as short as possible. And then they took him out
<PB N="10" REF="030135_0010_0FE49F22190E1BB8"/>
and brought in another, to see whether I told one story or not, and after they had re-examined me as much as they pleased, they went and brought me some of their bread made of pounded corn, and some hommany; and after I had eaten, they brought to me a little pri∣soner boy that had been taken about two years before on the river called Monongahela, though he delighted more in the ways of the Savages than in the ways of Christians; he used me worse than any of the Indians, for he would tell me to do this, that and t' other, and if I did not do it, or made any resistance, the Indians would threaten to kill me, and he would kick and cuff me about in such a manner that I hardly dare to say my soul was my own, although I daily underwent the greatest cruelty. Often times there would Indian strangers come to visit their tawny brethren, and the first salute they would give generally was to knock me down, and frequently to repeat their blows; and if I made any resistance, or shewed resentment before or after I got up, those savage-like brutes would repeat the same treatment, with terrible additions. I was forced to submit in silence to that usage for the space of a week.</P>
<P>It being then about the time the Indians were ga∣thering to meet the American army for battle, there was a number of strangers in the vicinity, and my mas∣ter told me they would kill me, and took me from the long council-house to his wife's camp, although she was gone to the hunting ground (which distance was about fifty miles) to winter; and the savages was ga∣thered together in this town for a general rendezvous, and remained here in number fifteen hundred, or there∣abouts, for one week, and then they all marched to meet Gen. St. Clair's army; and after those Indians were gone, my master's son took me to their hunting ground, where his master and several young Indians were, where I had more of a dog's life than that of a christian, for they would not allow me to sleep in the camp with them; and if I made a hut by myself, the Indian boy would pull it away, as if it was only to wear and fatigue me, and if they thought I was offended at it, they did it with seeming more pleasure, and I was obliged to submit, and thro the protection of divine providence I was enabled to support it.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="030135_0011_0FE49F23A4E052A8"/>
In the beginning of winter those savages lived only four or five days in a place, and would move eight or ten miles further at each move, and kept in continual motion until the snow was some depth; and by that time they had got one hundred and fifty miles from the town; at that time I had to build huts for five fami∣lies, to cut wood and carry it some distance, because they would not burn any but dry, &amp;c. I had a very short allowance of provisions, and being almost naked for the want of clothes, let the weather be wet or dry, hot or cold, I was kept at hard work of some kind or other, such as dressing Deer-skins, or hunting Rac∣coons; and with savage shouts they would bid me ex∣ert myself, or I should die. But the fatigues day and night was not all I suffered, for the Indian boys when I was asleep, used frequently to put live coals at my feet, to divert themselves in seeing me start; and as I had no clothes to myself, I often lay very near the fire; one night a boy of the tawny breed drove me farther from the fire, but I told them that I would not lay back any further unless they would give me some covering, but their cruelty was further exerted in not giving me any thing to eat for two days afterwards; and some times I would get meat and lay it up in the camp, but the boys would frequently come in and give it to the dogs, on purpose to insult me and put me to trouble; and one day there came one only into the camp where I fleat, took down my meat and gave it to the dog, looked me in the face and laughed. It offended me so much that I thought I might as well be tomahawk∣ed as to live in torments and vexations, and immedi∣ately caught up a stick and struck him over the head, and knocked him down, and almost stunned him; I was then certain there was not any possibility of saving my life, for he got up very quick and went to my master, and told him of the affair, and it proved well for me that he made additions to the story. I went to a camp that belonged to an Indian trader, and told him what had happened, and desired him to go and plead me off from being killed: but I had hardly told my story, before I saw my master coming with his tomahawk in his hand, and seemed in a great rage, but the man went and met him, and desired him to hear the other story before he went any farther, which he
<PB N="12" REF="030135_0012_0FE49F2532AF4FB0"/>
complied with, and after he had heard the truth of the whole matter, and how he was always tormenting and fatiguing me, turned back and went his way, but never said any thing of the affair to me afterwards. Soon after this affair happened, my master went a hunt∣ing for several days, and when he came home he brought several strangers with him, and they encamped but a small distance from us, and at night my master told me to cut some wood for them, I replied that I was very hungry, for I had eat nothing that day, and he saw that I did not move so quick as I ought to have done, he called his son, and told him to bring his war club, at my hearing that, I caught bold of my leggings and maucasins to put them on, but he came in a very great rage and violence with a war club in his hand, and struck at me with great force, and would have killed me, but as I saw the blow a coming I knocked off the back part of the cabbin and escaped the blow, otherwise I should have had my brains scattered through the camp; but I immediately got my tomahawk and went about three hundred yards from the camp, cut wood enough for them to burn that night; and having no∣thing on my feet or legs, the crust of the snow being almost hard enough to bear me up, but breaking thro' nearly every step being knee deep. Thus when I had done that small task (as they called it) my feet and legs looked as if they had been cut and hacked with sickles and crosscut saws, the blood pressing forth from each ghastly wound, from my knees to my toes; and when the savage-like brutes saw it, they laughed at me, and said I had got a beautiful pair of striped leggings on, which would make me rest well, &amp;c.</P>
<P>They used to send me a hunting often times with the Indian boys, and sometimes we should be gone three or four days at a time; at night after I had made a fire for them, they would make me build another for my∣self; and one time in particular, that we were our, I supposed we were within forty miles of an American fort, and in the morning I came to the fire, as they lay asleep, and took their tomahawks, and almost deter∣mined to kill them both, and make my escape unto the American fort; but I took the second thought that the woods were full of Indians, and if they should come across my track, and follow me, they would have ten
<PB N="13" REF="030135_0013_0FE49F26C3E0E798"/>
chances to catch me, where I had one to get clear of them; and I thought I should have some opportunity of getting away without running such a great risk; so I concluded it was best to be as patient as I could, altho' I had the tomahawk up several times to drop it into their heads; but I forebore striking.</P>
<P>Not long after that, as one of the Indian boys was sitting one day in the camp with me alone, he on side of the fire and I on the other, and having his bow in his hand, and a handful of wooden arrows, he would shoot them at me, and after many trials he shot one into my wrist, which bent the point against the bone, I caught hold of a stick about three inches thick and threw at him, and hit him on the side of his head, which knock∣ed him almost senseless; but it happened to be when my master was gone, and he did not get home under three weeks after, and by that time it had all died away; for I never heard any thing more about it; although if my master had been at home I believe there would not have been any such thing as saving my life; for I was for∣ced to keep out of the way of the squaws for two days, or they would have tomahawked me themselves.</P>
<P>By this time of the year corn grew very scarce, and the meat was very poor, and but a little of it for my share; sometimes they would kill a raccoon, and my part of it would be the head without any thing to eat with it, that was my allowance for a day, and very often for two or three days, and nothing at all but what nuts I could find in the woods, and some other trifles, and about the middle of March, as some of the Indian boys were a hunting, they found a large black snake, that was drawn out of the water by a mink, and brought it to the camp, roasted it with a squirrel, broke it up fine, and gave it to me to eat; but as soon as I found out what it was, I hove it down by the fire side, and when my mistress perceived that, she told me if I could not ear it, I should not have any thing, and they never offered me any thing more for three days; but about that time there were several Indians going upon a scout towards the American frontiers, my master and all the Indians that belonged to our family, went with that party, and left me with my mistress; but there were several other Indian camps, and some remaining Indians in the neighbourhood, who had orders to chas∣tize
<PB N="14" REF="030135_0014_0FE49F3013DEBF08"/>
me if I should be saucy to my mistress; and we re∣mained in that place about a week, and some American Indians came within ten miles of us, and killed two or three families of the Delaware Indians, which put those that I was with in such a fright, that they fled to their towns, which was about one hundred and fifty miles, but the way we went it was two hundred miles, to keep out of sight of some enemy Indians; the way being very bad that we went, our journey lasted three weeks, and all that time my mistress never gave me one spoon∣ful of any thing to eat, only what I could get in the woods, such as ground nuts, and some other nuts, and having a pack to carry weighing sixty or seventy pounds (that being my daily task) and frequently I could get no∣thing to eat for two days; sometimes I should get a pack of ground nuts, and my mistress would take them all from me. One day I borrowed a gun of an Indian and went a hunting, to kill something to eat, and by chance I sound eight large black snakes sunning them∣selves, I killed and strung them upon a stick, and carried them to the camp; my mistress looking out imagined I had some black squirrels; I came into camp and threw down the snakes at the old squaws feet, which enraged her much, she threw the tomahawk at me; the next thing that came to hand was a brand of fire, on which I was obliged to leave the camp, and did not come in again that day: but when the other Indians saw her, that knew of her giving me a roasted snake to eat some days before, it pleased them very much, because they said I served her tit for tat, or paid the old score; in the evening she called me, and asked what I brought those snakes to her for, I made reply that they were to pay her for the one she gave me to eat, she believing that I was even with her, let it drop, and it soon blew over, though I fared none worse for provisions after∣wards. When we arrived at the Maumee town, I was resolved to make my escape from the Indians. We arrived at the town about the middle of the afternoon; and after I had made a camp for my mistress, we not encamping on the side of the river the town was, I took a walk down the river to see if I could find a canoe to make my escape in, which I did, lying under the bank of the river, and in the evening about nine o'clock, af∣ter the old squaw had got asleep, I got up and crept

away from the camp, and then had to go one quarter of a mile through thick bushes to the river; it was ex∣ceedingly dark, and when I came there, the canoe was gone: I was obliged to make all the speed I could to get back to the camp, for fear I should be missed, and I had but just got to the fire, and laid down, before my mistress called me to make up a fire; on the next morning there came a prisoner by the name of Morris Doyle, from over the river, and I went out to work and asked him if he did not mean to try to make his es∣cape from the Indians; he said he did not know the woods, but if he could get any one to set off with him, he would go; I told him that I was resolved to go that night, and he said if we could get together he would go with me, and I asked him how we should get together; he said his master had a very nice canoe, and oftentimes the Indians would come after they were gone to bed, to come over the river, and he had to get up and fetch them across, and he said I must come down when I thought the Indians were all asleep and give an Indian halloo, and he would get up and come over the river with the canoe, and we would make the best of our way down the river, night and day, until we arrived at some christian settlement; but it happened in my favour, my mistress went over the river that day to see her daugh∣ter, and when she came back she said I must go over the river that night and stay there to clear land for corn: this pleased me very well, for I knew that I should have a much better opportunity to make my escape from them, and after I had got over the river where I was go∣ing to work, I staid there until about sunset, and then I asked liberty of the Indian if I might go and see Mor∣ris Doyle, I said I had not seen him for a great while, and he told me I might, so I went to his camp, which was about a mile; when I came there he had just got over the river from work, I told him that he might make ready for a start that night, for the sooner we went the better; we could make our escape, for my master was gone out to war, and all the Indians that belonged to that family, and I did not think the other Indians would follow us so close as my master; so we agreed to go that night, and as soon as it was dark I went out, as though I was going home, and lay in the brush, until the Indians were all asleep, and then I came in very still,
<PB N="16" REF="030135_0016_0FE49F332DA53DE0"/>
and awoke him, and we went down to the canoe, and when we came there we found no paddles in the canoe, and very poor poles, and the water was six and seven feet deep, and when we had gone down the river about half a mile, the Indian camps being very thick upon the banks of the river, they heard us going down, though it was so dark they could not see us, but there came an Indian down to the bank of the river, and called out three or four times, and asked who was there; but we squat down in our canoe, and let the current carry us down past them, but we had not gone more than three miles before we were hailed again by the Indians; but we set down in the canoe until we drifted past the camp, and then we went about four miles, and there came an Indian out of his camp, and came down to the river with a brand of fire in his hand, and spoke in his own language, and asked who was there, but we made no answer, but went on as fast as we could; we went on for an hour and a half, and we saw some person going down by the side of us with a brand of fire in his hand; I then told Doyle that it was not safe for us to go any further in a canoe, for I believed that the Indian was going down to head us, so we run our canoe ashore, and took to the land, and I went forward expecting that he was close behind me until I had got as much as a mile, then I made a halt, and called him, but I could heal nothing of him; I saw that it would not do for me to tarry long, for I heard the Indian canoes after us; I went that night with all the speed that I could make, although it was very slow, for it was exceeding dark, and about midnight it began to rain; some part of the way I went on the bank of the river, and the other part took to the woods, thick and thin, and went through swamps and thickets, sometimes I would run, and very often was brought up with my legs against an old log, which would pitch me headforemost into the bush for nearly a rod; and one time as I was a running, came to a gutter that run through from a pond, and the bank being almost straight down about twelve feet deep, and it being very dark that I did not perceive it, and taking one large step from top to bottom came headfore∣most into it in about four feet of water; but not∣withstanding I made shift to force my way through. I believe any one must suppose that I was not a very little
<PB N="17" REF="030135_0017_0FE49F34BB00F330"/>
frighted at that mistep, but when I came to the bank on the other side, it being something steep, I was very much troubled to get up, and falling back a number of times, but by good luck at last I got out; I travelled until daylight, and then went three miles back from the river into the woods, and came to a thick swamp, crept into a hallow log and lay there until evening, and then set out on my nocturnal rout; but faring very hard, and my being much bewildered, I did not know which way to steer, but I travelled about two hours, and could not find the river, then I was certain that I had got lost; I then turned another course, and had not gone more than a mile before I came to a foot path, and then I did not know which way to go, but I happened to take the wrong way, and had not gone far before I met an Indian in the path; but I knew if I run I should cer∣tainly be taken; and I thought perhaps if I could keep by him and say nothing, I might not be mistrusted; but as I came near him he asked me where I was go∣ing, I told him that I was hunting after a horse, and had got lost; he asked me what my master's name was, I told him I did not know; but he was a Dela∣ware; then he asked me if I thought I could find my camp alone; I told him that I expected that this path would lead to some camp that I knew. He said there was a camp close by us; then I told him that I would go there with him, and perhaps I should know the way home from there; he said he was a going there, then I believed I could not escape, as I could do no less than go with him, so I followed him to the camp, and when we came there, he asked me if I knew the camp, I re∣plied no, I did not, but I would stay there until the next morning, and then I could find the way home; all this time he did not mistrust my running away from the In∣dians, but when we came into the camp, he told them that I was lost and wanted to sleep there that night, so that I might find the way home in the morning; but in the mean time in came the infamous George Girty, the younger, and he knew me, and also that I had run away from the Indians, for they had been down to his camp that day after me; when he first came in he look∣ed at me, and spoke in the Indian language, and asked them how I came there, they made answer that I was lost, but Girty said that I was a liar, for he said there
<PB N="18" REF="030135_0018_0FE49F3CD626F1B8"/>
were two that run away from the Indians, and I was one of them; for, he said, the Indians was after us, and had left word with him to take me up if he could find me; then Girty asked me if I did not run away from the In∣dians, I told him I did not, he said he believed I told a lie; they directly began to converse together, to know what they should do with me; Girty said, that he would take me home with him, and the next day he would take me back to my master; all that while I set very well composed, as if I could not understand their lan∣guage, although I knew if I could get over the river, I should stand a very good chance to make my escape once more. The next day we set off to go to his camp, which was about six miles; he took very good care that I should not go behind, for he put me forward, following on with a tomahawk in one hand, and his rifle piece in the other, and we went in that condition until we arrived at the river, and he called for a canoe, and we went across, and soon came to his camp; but when we came there, his father and James Girty his brother, knew me, and several others of the Indians, and George Girty asked me where I wished to go; I told that I wanted to go where I could have better fare than I had among the Indians; he asked me if they did not give me enough to eat? I told him, instead of giving me enough to eat, they gave me nothing at all. He asked me if I was hungry, I told him that some victuals would be very kindly accepted, for I had not eat any thing for three weeks but what I could get in the woods; he told me if I would go and cut some wood and make a fire, I should have something to eat; it was then evening, and I cut some wood and made a fire. As I designed to make my escape the first opportunity, I sat by the fire all night, and I made two or three attempts to get away, but the dogs would hear me, and make such a barking that the savages would get up to see what the matter was; but early in the morning I heard them a whispering together to know what they should do with me. The old squaws, and young Girty said, they would carry me back that day to my master again. Hearing this, and not having any chance to get away, made me feel very down-hearted; and there was one George White-Eyes that could understand English—perceiving that I was somewhat troubled in mind,
<PB N="19" REF="030135_0019_0FE49F3F4A0B6940"/>
asked me what the matter was, I told him that I heard them say that they would carry them back to my mas∣ter; but I told him I was resolved not to go alive, for I knew they would put me to the torture in a most barbarous manner; and when he told them what I said, they concluded to send word to the Indians that I was there, which they did, by sending young Girty un∣known to me. When he had been gone about half an hour, a little negro boy that belonged to James Girty, asked me if I knew where young Girty was gone, I told him I did not, he said that he heard them agree for me to be kept there all day, while they could give word to the Indians. When I heard this, I went to old George Girty, and asked him where young Girty was gone, he said he was gone after an horse which was lost. Then I was convinced there was evil determined against me. I then told him that it lay in his power to help me, and begged he would. He said he thought I had better be contented to go back, for he did not think the Indians would hurt me. I told him he could not satisfy me with such stories as that, for he knew better. He said he could not assist me for fear of the Indians, for if they knew that he helped me, they would fall aboard of him; but he said that I might go to James Girty, his brother, and perhaps he would assist me, which I did; and when I came to him he also told me he could not do any thing for me for fear the Indians would find it out and blame him. Then I assked him if I might not go over the river to one McDaniel's, that kept a store on the other side, he said I might go see him if I would come back again; I told him if he was afraid of my running away, he might send his ne∣gro boy with me, accordingly he did; but as soon as I got over the river, I told the boy to stand by the canoe 'till I run up to the house, and then I would come back again; but instead of going to the house I went into the woods about a mile, and crept under an old log, and lay there from sunrise until dark; then went to Mr. McDanie's and told him my condition, and beg∣ged his assistance; but he said it was not in his power to help me; but if I had been there about two hours sooner I might have had my passage into Detroit, for he had sent two pettiaugers of packs to Detroit; but he could not assist me for fear of the Indians. I asked
<PB N="20" REF="030135_0020_0FE49EF9523EDE30"/>
him if he could not help me to some provisions, he said he had none but what he bought of the Indians, and had not any on hand. Then I began to be almost dis∣couraged for fear of being taken; but by chance there was a prisoner who lived near by, who asked me if I had not made my escape from the Indians, I told him that I had; he told me it was not safe for me to be there, for the Indians were hunting after me but a little while be∣fore; he advised me to go down the river that night; he gave me a paddle and shewed me a large pettiauger that I could go across the river in to the side that the vil∣lage was, and there I would find a small canoe, and to make the best of my way down the river; but when I got across the river, and went past the town, I could find no canoe, except a birch canoe, and not being ac∣quainted with them, I made out but poorly, and the wind blew very fresh up the river, so that it took me quite on the other side, hard by an Indian camp on the top of the bank, and the dogs made such a barking that the Indians came out, but it was so dark they could not discover me, and as soon as they were still I pushed over to the other side of the river, and let my canoe drive, and made the best of my way by land; then I had about two miles to get past the Indians, and to add to my sorrow, through thickets and over hedge fences, 'till I was almost torn to pieces; but after I had got about three or four miles past the Indian town, I heard two horse bells at a little distance from the river, and went to them, and caught one, and took off the cords that his legs was tied together with, and made a halter of them, and put it on, and was just ready to mount when I heard the Indians a little distance forward, which obliged me to leave the horse standing, and make the best of my way on foot through swamps and pond∣holes. About twelve o'clock that night I came into a small foot path, and I saw an Indian lay asleep by the side of the road: previous to his laying down he had made him a fire, but it was almost out, except a small coal which I happened to see, otherwise I should have steped upon the Indian which when I saw gave me a start: but I steping back softly, and creeping by him, the Indian did not awake. So I went forward that night, until break of day. Then I went back into the woods about half a mile, and lay down and went to
<PB N="21" REF="030135_0021_0FE49F42697232F0"/>
sleep 'till about ten o'clock in the morning, then I thought I would travel a little by day-light, and I went upon the shore, for the Indians were frequently passing and repassing in the road I went in. But after I had travelled about three miles on the shore, I saw an In∣dian camp over the river, and they discovered me, and gave an Indian halloo, and I gave them another, and they hallood the second time, and I again repeated the same, which made them mistrust I was not an In∣dian, they likewise came down the river and got into their canoe and came after me; but the river being very wide, and the wind blew exceeding hard up the river, so that it drove them up stream some ways from me; for there was a long point made out into the river betwixt me, and where they had to go on shore, and as soon as they were past the point, I left the river and went into the woods about forty rods from the river's bank, and crept into a thick tree top that was laying down, where I hid my∣self; though I had not been there but a few minutes before the Indians came by looking after me, 'till to∣wards evening, and then not finding me they returned back again; but I remained in this place until sunset. I supposed the Indians were all encampt for that day, so that there was no danger. I went on my way again. I had not gone but a few rods before I met three squaws, which gave me a start, supposing there were Indians close by, but as it happened, there was none to be seen. I travelled that night sometimes on the run and then on the walk, sometimes upon the san∣dy shore and then up in the bush. My moggasins were so worn out that my feet bled, but I made the best of my way 'till about the middle of the night, then I came where there was two large canoes loaded with skins, which belonged to the Indians that were encampt a small distance from the river, and I went to the canoe to see if I could find any thing to eat, and found a bag full of Deers and Raccoons skull bones, for dress∣ing of skins; it being very dark, I took to be some bread, and when I had got my hands full, not trying to eat any 'till I had got some distance from them, and when I attempted to eat I found I was deceived, which vexed me very much, after I had taken so much pains to steal for my life a parcel of bones. But I made all
<PB N="22" REF="030135_0022_0FE49F4C02A4DD58"/>
the speed I could to get away for fear of the Indians, and travelled 'till about an hour before day-light, and then I heard an Indian drum at a great distance off; then I began to be encouraged, for I supposed by the intelligence I had received, that I was not far from some christian people. But when I had got down, the In∣dian town was upon the other side of the river, all ex∣cept two or three camps, which were covered with flags, and stood on that side of the river, and I went to one of them and saw nobody except an old squaw and two small children, so I made bold to go in and warm my∣self by the fire, for I was very much fatigued and worn out, and chilled through with the cold, for it had hailed and rained all night, which made me very uncomfort∣able, being out in the storm; and when I had set down by the fire about half an hour, the old squaw awoke, and made some movement, so I made the best of my way out of the camp, without being discovered. In the mean time it had got to be day light. Then I re∣paired to the river side. My mogasins being quite worn out, and my feet so sore and bloody, and body might easily tracked me on the ground; and when I had got down the river, about one mile, I came to a small village of Indians, where there was a store kept by a Frenchman, and as I passed by I saw the door partly open, and turning to go in, I saw the floor co∣vered with drunken Indians, and hearing one of them say in their language there is a white man; I turned and went round the house, and there I found a hog's-pen where the hogs had just crept out, and I crept into their place; but I had not been there long before the Indians came round the house, looking after me, but not finding me, they went in again; and directly a Frenchman came out of the house, and as soon as I saw him I presented myself to him, and asked him if he could not assist me, he said he could not, for fear the Indians would find it out and kill him. Fur∣thermore, he said it was not safe for me to be there; for the Indians would soon be up an I likely to see me, and then it would be impossible for me to get clear; but he said I must go ten miles further, and I should come to an Englishman's house, where I should be much sa∣fer than I was there; moreover, he said I must be very quick in going, for the Indians would be up and
<PB N="23" REF="030135_0023_0FE49F4D9090B130"/>
after me, and it would not be possible for me to get away from them. I immediately went on ten miles, which I was about two hours in going, being very faint and tired, and my feet run with blood; and the first house I came to was a Mr. McCormic. My appear∣ance at this time, may be supposed to be dismal—with∣out cloathing, almost starved—and my beard and hair grown long and frightful.—When I came to the door and knocked, he bid me come in, and when he saw me in that frightful situation he was almost at his wits end, and cried out where the devil did you come from? I told him that I came out of the Indian country; he answered, what the devil brought you there; I said it was my misfortune to get among them; he replied that there were a great many rascals which he would be glad to have slaves to the Indians all their days. I thought then I might as well remained among the In∣dians, as to have risked my life thus far, and be so treated. I then asked him if he knew any white peo∣ple that lived near, he said I would find them down the river. Then I bid him farewell, and went on my way down the river. I thought to myself it would be safe for me to keep round by the lake to Detroit, and not be seen any more as I could not tell a friend from a foe. And when I had gone on about half a mile down the river, walking along very slowly, and thinking to myself how I should get by some Indian towns undis∣covered, that was on my way, I met a man by the name of Thomas Smith, an Indian store-keeper; and as soon as he saw me he asked me which way I was traveling, I made answer, where I could get quarters, though he knew by my appearance that I had made my escape from the Indians; he further enquired how far I had come, I told him from the Maumee town, which was an hundred and thirty-five miles from the camp: He then asked me if I had any provisions, I told him it was the fifth day since I had eat any thing but nuts; he invited me into his house, and said he would help me to some, which I received very kindly; for truly he was the first friend I had found on my way. And when I had come in he gave me some victuals to eat, but I was so faint that a very little served me. I had not been there more than an hour before the Indians came, is pursuit of me, and began to enquire after me; but
<PB N="24" REF="030135_0024_0FE49F4F1D85D898"/>
Mr. Smith put me up in his chamber, and kept me hid there until his boat came from Detroit, then he put me on board and sent me on my way thither. But on my way to said Detroit, we had two or three Indian towns to pass by, and the savages were apprised of my running away, for they had the discription of me by the dress I had on when I came from them; but the boatmen gave me other clothes to put on, so that my garb appeared like that of a Frenchman; so I passed by undiscovered, although we lay wind bound in an Indian town for some days.</P>
<P>And so we arrived at Detroit, April 30, 1792.</P>
