<P N="1">1. OUR Great REDEEMER, has by his good porvidence entertained and encouraged his faithful people, with the redemption of many cap∣tives, from the hands of our French and Ind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an enemies. It is infinitely reasonable, that this good providence of Heaven should be glorified; and a collection, tho' an imperfect one, of certain me∣morables occurring to these children of the capti∣vity, will afford some great revenues of glory to it; which may be accompanied with several things, where by the faithful also may be more than a little edified.</P>
<P N="2">2. Our eastern Indians, had no sooner, with all possible assurances, renewed their league of peace with us, but being moved by the instigation of the French, they perfidiously and barbarously surpri∣zed, seven of our more naked and secure plantati∣ons; and coming at once into the scattered families they did, on August 10, 11. 1703. reward the hospitable civilities that were shown them, with the murder of above seventy English people, and the captivity of near an hundred. Upon this there ensued lesser depredations, and captivations, as the treacherous enemy found opportunity for them.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="019426_0003_0FABA3B74D4ECCA0"/>About half a year after these calamities thus begun on the eastern parts of the country, the western had a taste of the same cup given to them. On February 1703. 4. An army consisting, as it was judg'd, of about four hundred French and In∣dians, made a descent upon the little town of Deerfield, the most northernly settlement on Con∣necticut river, which had long been a watchful and an useful barrier for the rest of the plantations in the neighbourhood. They surprized the place, about an hour or two before break of day, and in a little time, not without loss to themselves, they butchered and captivated above one hundred and fifty of the people. Mr. <HI>John Williams,</HI> the worthy minister of that pious and holy flock, was carried into captivity, with five of his children; two of his children were slain; and his desirable consort, beginning to faint, at about a dozen miles of the doleful journey, they the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, like themselves▪ cruelly murdered her, and left her for the funeral which her friends afterwards bestowed on her. Be∣fore they reach'd unto Mont-Real, a journey dis∣patch'd by the parcels now divided, in twenty days, more or less, near twenty more of the captives lost their lives; for the manner was, that if any found themselves not able to travel through the deep snow, now on the ground, the savages would strike their hatches into their heads, and there leave them weltring in their blood.</P>
<P N="3">3. The condition of the captives, thus fallen into the hands of the enemy, has furnish'd us w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th divers matters, not unworthy to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e observed and remembred.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="019426_0004_0FABA3B8DEDB1028"/>The French did buy many of the captives, from the Indians, among whom they met with many instances of humanity, more or less, accord∣ing to the humour of those, in whose families they became servants or sojourners. Others of the cap∣tives were a long while detained with the Indians in their horrid and howling wigwams, and some are to this day miserably circumstanced among those dragons of the wilderness. Various methods have been used for the redemption of these cap∣tives; and at several times, there have been re∣turned several of them; yea, several companies of them. The last, who came in number between forty and fifty with Mr. Sheldon, (a good man, and a true servant of the church in Deerfield, who twice took his tedious and dangerous j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urneys in the winter, from New-England unto Canada, on these occasions) came aboard at Quebec, May 30, and after nine weeks difficult passage, arrived at Boston, August 1, 1706.</P>

<HEAD>TO MY Much respected FRIENDS, that are on their voyage FROM Quebeck, for New-England, present with care, I pray. Per <HI>SAMUEL SCAMMON,</HI> Q. D. C.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My brethren, dear friends, and Christian neighbours,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN as much as I may neither be permitted to return with you, nor be permitted to come to see you before you return; these come to acquaint you, that I am truly desirous of your Prosperity, for soul and body. I would bless God who is open∣ing a door of return for you: and if God be your front-guard, and rereward, it shall yet go well with you; a mercy, I would humbly be imploring for you. I hope you will continue to pray for us that are left behind, that God would preserve and reco∣ver us, and give us grace to glorify his holy name, tho' he continue, ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>crease our trials,, if we may be witnesses fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> God, and serve him, tho' under fiery trials, we shall be no losers. The Lord help us by his grace (for of our selve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we are insuffi∣cient to do any thing) to keep the faith, and suffer according to his will he has foretold us, that through much tribulation we must enter into the kingdom of heaven. If God will bless; no matter

what men say of us. As for you, I would offer a few words of Counsel to you in your voyage. What is it that it most upon your heart in your re∣turn? Is it that you may with all freed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m glorify God, in bringing forth much fruit, wherby he may be glorifyed, whilst you are again planted in the court-yards of our God? How sorrowful is it, if your greatest design be to see your friends so long separated from you: to gain estates, and reco∣ver your outward losses; and to be free again to go and come as you lift! When you return, con∣sult, <HI>Luk.</HI> 8.39. and see from thence, that it well becomes them who have had eminent mercies, to be shewing to others what great things God has done for them. Hereby you will be advancing the glory and ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our of God the highest, last, and most noble end man was made for. Hereby you will comply with the revealed will of God: for he says, call upon me in the day of trouble; I will de∣liver thee, and thou shalt glorify me. Hereby you will also stir up others to glorify God on your be∣half. Hereby also you may gain good counsels, directions, and the prayers of many in order to your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mproving such mercies, so as God may have glory, and your souls a continue profiting, yea hereby you may be instrumental in putting others upon trusting God, and making him their refuge in an evil day. Let God have the glory of pre∣serving you; and don't ascribe it to your own wis∣dom, or goodness; don't think to go sharets or partners with God in his glory: He has done it for the honour of his name, Read <HI>Psal.</HI> 86.13.14. and learn from thence, that a truly graci∣cious

soul delivered out of afflictions, will be very careful to fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fil his promises, and pay his vows made to God in the day of his distress. For other∣wise you will unavoidably fall into the number of them spoken of, <HI>Psal.</HI> 78—34, 35, 36, 37. W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th∣out this, you will fail of a comfortable evidence, that your deliverance is in special mer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y. It's cer∣tain, That he who glo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ifies God, is one that orders his conversation aright. Be careful to perform your promises as to the matter, manner, time, and end of obedience: Be thorough in your obedi∣ence. The performing your promises will turn to your own special and peculiar gain and profit. Surely, God has a worse prison, than any of you have yet been in, for them that will not honestly pay their debts of obedience to him. <HI>Eccles.</HI> 5.4. Consider how angry God was with Hezekiah, for not rendring to the Lord according to the mercy bestowed upon him, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 32.25, God mani∣fested his displeasure in very signal works of judg∣ment upon Israel in the wilderness for their un∣thankfulness to God for his great mercy in bring∣ing them from Egypt; yea, destroyed many of them in the wilderness. You will have many temptations from within, and from without, to be neglecting your duties of obed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence. You have the world, as it were to begin again. Well, con∣sider the greatest concernment is to make sure of an incorruptible inheritance, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. We are here at longest, but only sojourners. If you turn again to folly, God will be very ang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, <HI>Jer.</HI> 2.20 &amp;c. Surely a provoking God to anger is not the way
<PB N="10" REF="019426_0008_0FABA3BBA26E2DB0"/>
to thrive for soul or body. Yea, neglect of duty, will give great ground to fear that the furnace has not been sanctified to your purging and puri∣fying. Peace and friendship with God, is the best peace and friendship. Sincere souls have it much upon their hearts how they shall walk answerable to the expectations of God from them for the mercies they receive at his hands, <HI>Psal.</HI> 116, 12. They are careful that their thoughts, desires, de∣lights, choice, refusals, words and actions be such as may be for God's glory and honor. They are therefore very watchful against every thing that would draw away their hearts from God, or pre∣vent and hinder their living holily. Yea, all that have gained spiritual benefit by afflictions, are much in bewailing their unsuitable behaviour under af∣flictions. Oh, it's a matter of shame to think how much they pored upon their afflictions, and how lit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le on their sins that procured all their afflictions; that they were so impatient under afflictions; so much concerned to get afflictions removed; and so little concerned to carry graciously under them, to profit by them, to get them sanctified to them: Yea, that they have been so very unbelieving, and full of carking cares under them, and so back∣ward to a committing all to God's disposal; that they have been so full of guile and deceit, and unbroken in spirit in all their acknowledgments and confessions of sin; so little of a gracious prayerfulness; Yea, that there is so much oppo∣sition in their will to the will of God in disposing and governing the affairs of the world according to the council of his own will; Yea, that they
<PB N="11" REF="019426_0009_0FABA3BC5DE7F9B0"/>
have in so great a degree been forgetful of God, whilst they have been inordinately afraid of man. They bewail that they were so very unthankful for what mercies they had continued to them and that they did no more improve them for God and his glory; whilst others bewail that they have been so long under afflictions; do you bewail that you carried no better under them. If God in special mercy be leading you forth; I am sure he is leading you out in penitential weeping and supplications. If you come forth as gold well re∣fined; cleansed from all your filthiness, and saved from all your idols: What a mercy do you enjoy! The best freedom, is freedom by Jesus Christ from spiritual evils. Sirs, the expectations of god, and man too, will be great from you. Oh! let it be made evident that you were brought into capti∣vity for your good. Oh! improve gospel privi∣ledges with all fidelity. Don't be grudge God time for religious services. Don't content your∣selves in being hearers; but be you doers of the word. Let your thankfulness be expressed in a continued, universal, holy conversation. Watch a∣gainst all appearances of evil; and all leading causes to a forgetting God, or ill requiting of him for all his kindness to you.</P>
<P>Dont think after your return; that, having de∣sired publickly in the congregations of Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s peo∣ple to have thanks returned to God on your behalf; you have done your duty. This is the way to be like them that Sang his praises, but soon forgot his wondrous works. Thanksliving is the best thansgiving. Oh! that all your souls may flourish

Oh! make all haste to get into a converted state. Christ seems to be saying to you go and sin no more, lest a worse thing come upon you.

If God has sanctfied to any of you your outward captivity, to a purging away your sins, and to a making you partakers of his holiness: Say with the psalmist, that it is good for you, that you have been affl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cted: yea, that in faithfulness he has caused you to be afflicted. And at your return, be you found among them that sit under christ's shadow with great delight: and let his fruit be sweet to your taste. Draw nigh to him in all his holy institutions, that your souls may be filled with the fulness of him who filleth all in all. Let your souls follow hard after the Lord, and the desire of your souls be to the remembrance of his name. As to them of you who were through christ reconciled to God, before your cap∣tivity; let it be evident that you have been purged to bring forth more fruit; <HI>Joh.</HI> 15 2.

The experience of saints in all ages, proves that a long time of outward prospe∣rity has been more hurtful to the children of God, as to tht concerns of their souls; than manifold trying afflictions for a long time.

Be entirely devoted to the gloryfying of God. If any of you labour under spiritual darkness, and be buffeted with temptations; spread your case con∣tinually, without ceasing, before a prayer hearing God; Be advising with the word of God for light and direction; Be acting and exercising the faith of dependence on God, when you ha'nt a faith of assurance <HI>Isa.</HI> 50, 10.

And at your return, beware lest you forget your own judgment, whilst in captivity, of the preciousness of such a choice mercy.

Having seen the vanity and trans<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>toriness of earthly comforts; let your conversation for the future, be more in heaven. You will daily need to be in the exercise of faith for a conquest over the world. Let us look after those things that are unseen, that are eternal. Whilst others cry, give, give as to the world; let our cry be for grace and spiritual blessings. The

<P>I have written more largely here, because I know your temptations (having the world to begin again) will arise much from thoughts what to eat, and what to drink, and wherewith to be cloathed; having lost your earthly comforts.

which our better instructed babes, would by no means think to be allowed of.</P>
<P N="3">3d. Besides what was done by some letters from hence, our people took opportunities to fortify one another; and when they were hindred from doing it, by meeting and praying together, (which was forbidden to them) or by discourse with one ano∣ther, they did it by writing.

<P>ASTONISHING deliverances have been sent from Heaven, to many of our Captives. They have been many a time upon the point of destruction; but, these poor ones have cryed unto

the Lord, and he has remarkably delivered the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪</P>
<P>'Tis a wonderful restraint from God upon the Bruitish savages, that no English woman was eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> known to have any violence offered unto her chasti∣ty, by any of them.</P>
<P>'Tis wonderful, that no more of the captives have been murdered by them, neither when they were drunk, nor when the Caprichio's, and the cruelties, of their diabolical natures were to be gra∣tified.</P>
<P>'Tis wonderful, that when many of the captives have been just going to be sacrificed, some strange interposition of the divine Providence has put a stop to the execution, and prevented their being made a sacrifice. The stories are numberless. Take a few of them.</P>
<P>ACRUE of Indians had been three days with∣out any manner of sustenance. They took an English child, and hung it before the fire to rost it for their supper; but that these canibals might satiate their—I want a name for it,—as well as their hunger, they would roast it alive. The child began to swell. A canoe arrived at that instant, with a dog in it. The lesser devils of the crue, proposed their taking the dog instead of the child; They did so; and the child is yet living! Her name is, <HI>Hannah Parsons.</HI></P>
<P>A Man had valiantly kill'd an indian or two, before the savages took him. He was next morning to undergo an horrible death, whereof the manner and the torture, was to be assigned by the widow Squa of the dead indian. The French priests told him, they had laboured to divert the
<PB N="27" REF="019426_0025_0FABA3CC1F9EA678"/>
tygers from their bloody intention, but could not prevail with them; he must prepare for the terri∣ble execution. His crys to God were hard, and heard; When the sentence of the squa was demand∣ed, qui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e contrary to every one's expectation, and the revengful inclination so usual and well known among these creatures; she only said,—his death won't fetch my husband to life; Do nothing to him! So nothing was done to him.</P>
<P>A Woman was carried aside, by her monster of a master; he fastened a rope about her neck; It was in vain for her to contend; the hatchet must presently have dispatched her, if the halter had failed; she had no remedy but to cry unto God; her master throws up the end of the rope over the limb of the tree; he ascends to hale her and to tye her up; and then a fine exploit for the wretch! a <HI>memorable name</HI>! however the limb hap∣pily breaks; down he falls! full of madness, he goes to repeat his brave action: An Indian com∣mander just in the nick of time comes in upon him; reproaches him very bitterly; takes her away from h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m; and sends her away to Canada.</P>
<P>BUT we ought not to pass over the marvellous display of the power of God, in supporting and preserving the poor captives, when they tra∣velled through the horrid wilderness, oftentimes much more than a score of miles in a day, and thro' very deep snows, and with vast loads on their backs; and grievously pinched with hunger, hav∣ing scarce one bit of any refreshment, for whole days together. Poor, weak, sick women have done so!</P>

They then loosed her, and bid her walk. She could not stir. By the help of a stick she got half a step forward. She look'd up to God. On the sudden a new strength entred into her. She tra∣velled that very day, twenty miles a foot. She was up to the neck in water six times that very day in passing of rivers. At night she fell over head and ears into a slough in a swamp, and was hardly got out a live. She got not the least cough nor cold by all of this; she is come home alive unto us.</P>
<P>Many more such instances might be mentioned, we will supersede them all, with a relation of what b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fel Mrs. B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>adley of Haverhill. <HI>Ab una disce omnes.</HI></P>
<P>THIS virtuous woman, had been formerly for two years together, a captive in the hands of the barba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous indians; a subject of wondrous afflictions, of wondrous deliverances. Her husband at length found her out, and fetch'd her home, and their fam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly went on happily for six years together after it. But, the clouds return after the ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n.</P>
<P>On Feb. 6, 1703, 4. She with her sister and a maid or two, and some children (a man being also in the room) were talking about the Indians, and
<PB N="29" REF="019426_0027_0FABA3CDA03EF588"/>
behold one of the fierce tawnies look'd in, with a gun ready to fire upon them. The Englishman pull'd him in, and got him down, and Mrs. B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>adly took the opportunity to pour a good quantity of scalding sope (which was then boiling over the fire) upon him, whereby he was ki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l'd immediately. A∣nother of the tawnies followed at the heels of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s brother; who stabbed the Englishman to the heart. Unto him she dispensed also a quantity of her sope, which not killing him, she with the other women and children ran into the chamber. The house was fired by the indians, and M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s. B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>adly with her companions found it nececessary to retire behind the house. One of the women fell into the hands of the indians; and they that remained were Mrs. Bradly and her sister; each of them having a child of M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Bradlies with her. The sister was discerned by the indians, who commanded her to come out unto them, and threatened that they would else cut her to pieces. Mrs. Bradly very gener∣ously bid her sit still, and wait for a better time to escape; and offered her, that inasmuch as the In∣dians knew of but one there, she would be that one, and go out in her stead. She did so; and the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eby her obliged sister and the child with her were preserved; but Mrs. Bradly was no sooner come to the savages, but they employed a head-breaker on the child that she brought unto them.</P>
<P>She was now entered into a second captivity; but she had the great incumbrance of being big with child, and w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thin six weeks of her time! After about an h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s rest, wherein they made her put on snow shoes, which to manage requires more than
<PB N="30" REF="019426_0028_0FABA3CE5BC0D7D8"/>
ordinary agility, she travelled with her tawny guar∣dians all that night, and the next day until 10 o'¦clock; associated with one woman more who had been brought to bed but just one week before. Here they refreshed themselves a little, and then travelled on till night; when they had no refresh∣ment given them, nor had they any till after their having travelled all the forenoon of the day ensuing, and then too, whatever she took, she did through sickness throw it up again.</P>
<P>She underwent incred<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble hardship and famine; a Mooses hide, as tough as you may suppose it, was the best and the most of her diet. In one and twenty days they came to their head quarters, where they staid a fortnight. But then her snow shoes were taken from her; and yet she must go every step above the knee in snow, with such wear∣iness, that her faint soul often pray'd, that the Lord would put an end unto her weary life! until they came to another place, where they stay'd for three weeks together.</P>
<P>Here in the night, she found herself <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll, and having the help of only one woman, who got a little hem∣lock to lay about her, and with a few sticks made a shift to blow up a little fire, she was in half an hour delivered of the infant, that she had hitherto gone withal. There she lay, till the next night, with none but the snow under her, and the heaven over her; in a misty and a rainy season. She sent then unto a French Priest, that he would speak un∣to her squa mistress, who then, without condescend∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> upon her, allow'd her a little birch rind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> her head from the injuries of the weather,
<PB N="31" REF="019426_0029_0FABA3CF484C30F8"/>
and a little bit of dried moose, which being boiled she drank the broth, and gave it unto the child.</P>
<P>In a fortnight, she was called upon, to travel a∣gain with her child in her arms; ever now and then, a whole day together, without the least mor∣sel of any food, and when she had any, she fed only on ground nuts, wild onions and lilly roots. By the last of May, they arrived at Cowesick, where they planted their corn; wherein she was put unto a hard task, so that the child extremely suffered. The savages would sometimes also please themselves with casting hot embers into the mouth of the child, which would render the mouth so sore, that it could not suck for a long while together. So, that starv'd and died.</P>
<P>Their they staid until they weed their corn; but then some of our friend indians coming on them, kill'd seven of them; whereat, away they fled for Canada, and never saw their corn-field any more. But they made a forty-days ramble of it, before they reach'd thither; in which, if at any time, her heart began to faint, her mistress would be ready to strike the mortal hatchet into her head.</P>
<P>The French being thought more civil to the English than to the Indians, her mistress thereat provoked, resolved, that she would never sell her to the French. Accordingly she kept her a twelve-month with her, in her squal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d wigwam: Where, in the following winter, she fell sick of a feaver: but in the very he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ghth and heat of her paroxysms, her mistress would compel her sometimes to spend a winter night, which is there a very bitter one, abroad in all the bitter frost and snow of the cli∣mate.
<PB N="32" REF="019426_0030_0FABA3CFDBC8C330"/>
She recovered; but four Indians died of the fever, and at length her mistress also. Another Squa then pretended an heirship unto her: with whom she lived and saw many more strange deli∣verances. They had the small pox in the family; but she never had it. She was made to pass the river on the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce when every step she took she might have struct through it if she pleased. Many more such preservations might come into her story.</P>
<P>At last, there came to the sight of her, a priest from Quebec, who had known her in her former captivity at Naridgowock. He was very civil to her, and made the Indians to sell her unto a French family, for fourscore livres, where, tho' she wrought hard, she lived more comfortably and contentedly.</P>
<P>She poured out her continual supplications to heaven; sometimes two or three of her own sex, would by stealth come to join with her in suppli∣cating to the glorious LORD She had her mind often irradiated with strong persuasions and assuran∣ces, that she should yet see the goodness of God in this land of the living. Her tender and loving husband, accompanied Mr. Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ldon in his last ex∣pedition. He found her out, and fetch'd her home a second time; she arrived with those of the last re∣turn from the captivity; and affectionately calls upon her friends, O magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s name together!</P>
<P>BECAUSE of its having some affinity with the foregoing relations, and that we may at once discharge our selves of what we can relate concern∣ing our captives, we will conclude with a copy af a letter sent unto one of the ministers in Boston.</P>

<SALUTE>Reverend Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE occasion of my now writing to you is, because I lye under a vow and promise, to the great and almighty God, to declare and make known his wonderful goodness and mercy to me, and likewise to have his name blessed and praised in your congregation on my behalf. I shall brief∣ly inform you. "Being taken a prisoner some time last January, by the French; in going to Port Royal we met with very tempestuous weather and were fast in an harbour near Cape Sables. And there two Frenchm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n had orders from their Capt. to take me with them, and go to Port Royal by land. They took with them but lit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ead; &amp; we travelled one week in the woods, in a m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>serable condition. I had myself no shoes nor stockings, but a piece of skin wrapt about my feet; and the snow being very deep, we could not tra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; be∣ing weak for want of provision, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the woods, not knowing which way to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></P>
<P>"One of the Frenchmen loaded his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> presented it at me, telling me, That it was imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>sible to find Port-Royal, and I must die and they must eat me. Then I begged liberty to pray unto God, before he killed me; and he granted it me. As I was at prayer, it struck into my mind, That I had formerly heard yourself declare in your pul∣pit, what great and wonderful things had been done by prayer; particularly, that it had stopped the mouths of lions, and that it had quenched the violence of the fire. So I earnestly begged of God
<PB N="34" REF="019426_0032_0FABA3D220D4BD48"/>
that he would manifest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> great power to me, by turning the hearts of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that were about to take away my life."</P>
<P>The words were be sooner out of my mouth but the Frenchman, seeming to have tears in his eye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d me rise up; he would try one day longer. And he b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d me go get wood for a fire. It pre∣sently grew dark; and then I made an escape from them, and hid myself in the woods, until the next day that they were gone. And then I found the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay out of the woods, un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the water side, and there I not clams. These Frenchmen found the way <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Port Royal, and there told what they had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. The governor put them in prison, and sent out two men, and charged them not to re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they had found me, dead or alive In <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our days after these Frenchmen left me, they f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d me alive, and brought me provision, and a pair of shoes and carried me to Port Royal.</P>
