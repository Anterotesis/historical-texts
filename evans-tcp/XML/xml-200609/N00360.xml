<HEAD>A LETTER From FATHER La CHAISE, Confessor to the French King, To FATHER PETERS, Confessor to the King of England.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Honored Father,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WIth unexpressible Joy I received yours of June the 22 by which I un∣derstand the good effect of our Endeavors which we have so Long been Labouring in: and am glad to hear the work is so well managed and done, you following the advise we gave as well by divers Letters as word of mouth from our <HI>Ambassador Barillon</HI> now at <HI>whitehall.</HI> And as soon as I had received the news I went to the <HI>King my Master</HI> and acquain∣ted him that there was one of the <HI>Holy babes</HI> of your owne getting brought to the <HI>queen</HI> and that both the <HI>King</HI> and she did owne it for their owne son and <HI>Prince of Wales,</HI> and under that notion it was shewd and published to the whole Na∣tion, then I acquainted the F<HI>athers of our Society</HI> who had with sacred Instruments for the purpose Calculated the whole pro∣ject Long before: and shewed their Con∣stant zeal in this weighty affair: they also were Extreamly Joyful when they heard it, and it is impossible. To express the mirth and Jollyty of all our friends in this Country who have heard of this weighty Concern, for now it seems as if heaven it self did Contribute to our
<PB N="4" REF="000438_0004_0FA5AF26B4AB9CB0"/>
designes <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> help all our Inventions, give the Holy Church greater Dominion, and render our Enemies the longer the weaker. For in our Country the Here∣ticks are very near quite destroyed: in <HI>Piemont</HI> and <HI>Savoy</HI> they are Reduced to a small weak number, in <HI>Hungary</HI> they shall no Longer Continue then <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Empe∣ror and the <HI>Turk</HI> have made peace, for it is the opinion of our Society that the <HI>Em∣peror</HI> doth not stand in need of the Assi∣stance of the Protestant Electors, nor need he fear them when that War is En∣ded. Then shall we perswade him not only to destroy them in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>his Territor<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> but also to make war upon the <HI>Netherlands</HI> &amp; so root out all the Hereticks from the face of the Earth; and indeed the Hereticks in Hol∣land are not far from their Ru<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, as for the <HI>Palatinate</HI> it will be Easily done there because we have got a <HI>Popish Elector</HI> Cho∣sen, and for the <HI>King of Denmark</HI> we doubt not but to make him in his Country fol∣low the Example of the great Monark in ours either to make them turn or Run, and tho the freindship between that <HI>Crowne</HI> and ours seems weake yet it is not so much decayed as some people wish and pretend. And if I please I can quickly make him Zealous, and a perfect servant to our King and that he shall assist in the <HI>Romish Cause</HI> as faithfully as the best <HI>Catholik</HI> as euer was born, for in his Country the sheep yeild him but a small fleece, and let our King but send him a good present of <HI>Pi∣stols</HI> and he shall do all that we desire him tho it were to subscribe to the <HI>Alchoran</HI> and turn <HI>Mahometan.</HI></P>
<P><HI>England Holland</HI> and <HI>Switzerland</HI> are in∣deed the onely bulworks and places of Refuge that the Hereticks have left: and it hath Cost us many a nights study and divers meetings to Consult how we may bring them under, and now we have an Excellent opportunity, to which purpose our King hath resolved to bring the <HI>Swit∣sers</HI> under his Dominion and Convert those Hereticks by his Dragoons: and also to do his best to destroy that <HI>Nest of Hereticks</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> which resolution I will Con∣stanrly put him in mind off as often as I give him absolution.</P>
<P>When I Consider of these things it re∣joyces me to think how zeal us <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Ma∣jesty of England</HI> is to perfect his designes, which are to us of great Concerns, to which purpose he hath the assistance of our troupes. And <HI>Cardinal Furster<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>g</HI> [when he shall be made <HI>Elector of Collen</HI>] Can bring <HI>Holland</HI> under his obedience, haveing first made himself master of his owne people and brought them in subje∣ction to his absolute <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: I say when I Consider and think of these things they do so rejoyce me that I am almost over∣whelmd there with, nay it is to great that I am not able to write it, and indeed it is the greatest pleasure I have in this world, and I must say that since the last Letter I received from you things have been so forwarded that I must now ne∣cessaryly Conclude we are not far from the highest step: and nothing can be said to be perfect now, till I can demonstra∣bly see such signes that will testify the work is compleat.</P>
<P>And as Concerning that Letter of yours which gave us that Incomparable satisfa∣ction and joy, the principle things therein are these following: <HI>first,</HI> you did very wisely not to follow the Litteral direction that we had laid downe, but to use such endeavors and devices as the then acci∣dents and present affaires did require, and indeed they were such as did much con∣duce to the perfection of our bussines: namely, the sending the <HI>Bishops to the Tower:</HI> the <HI>Prince</HI> and <HI>Princess</HI> of <HI>Denmark</HI> to the <HI>Bath,</HI> and divers <HI>Heretick Gentlemen</HI> to <HI>Windsor</HI> where they Expected the <HI>Queen</HI> should lye in: in which inventions you shewed your admirable skill and Judgment: for they without doubt would have been present and you say the Laws of <HI>England</HI> do so require it Therefore it was your wisdom to advise the King to impose some
<PB N="5" REF="000438_0005_0FA5AF274E1E2E78"/>
thing upon the <HI>Bishops</HI> which they could not in honor do, and so find occasion to send them to the <HI>Tower</HI> and there keep them till the great worke was done.</P>
<P>Neither was the other part of your In∣vention <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to be admired, when you perswaded the <HI>Prince</HI> and <HI>Princess</HI> of <HI>Den∣mark,</HI> that it was a month or six weeks before the <HI>Queen</HI> could be delivered and they might easily return sooner, and there∣fore if you had not taken this course they would have waited and have been prying into the bussines, and the other is also as praise worthy as any, for you could not have trickt those Heretick fops better then to send them like <HI>fools</HI> to <HI>windsor</HI> with a Commission to set up a <HI>bed,</HI> provide a <HI>Cradle</HI> and a <HI>Nurs</HI> and divers other things necessary for her lying in, and also to wait there till she came, which you never intended she should, and likewise it was a good project of yours to give out that the Queen altered her mind often about the place she would be delivered at, for when you had given out seven or eight several times it was resolved to be <HI>windsor, Hampton court, Richmond,</HI> St. <HI>James'</HI>s, &amp;c▪ they did not at last beleeve when you Re∣solved in earnest, by which means you catcht the fools neatly: all which were neatly Laid and contrived, for which we thank you wishing all succes to your de∣signes and Endeavors toward the perfe∣cting this mighty work.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> That you keep both their Majestys to their former Resolution in declareing this child to be really theire owne, and also by publick proclamation for a day of Thanks giveing to tell the whole Nation he was their son, and Heir to the Crowne in spight of all the pra∣teing Inquisitive <HI>Hereticks</HI> in <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> who have got some kind of sent of the work and designe now in hand, but I can tell them, they think they know more then really they do, how ever they have En∣deavored by dispersing of various <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to render his Majesty suspected, and I assure you we have often time been in great fear that your King would have fell of and de∣parted from his pious Resolution, for we well know that he is but a weak man, and you know such kind of people are easyly led away: when they have nothing to de∣pend upon but what lyeth in other mens heads.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> That there is such great care taken for the young Prince, and also in case of the <HI>Kings</HI> death to declare his con∣sort <HI>Queen Regent,</HI> and to appoint your self, the <HI>Lord Chancelor</HI> with some other <HI>good men</HI> to govern while the <HI>Prince</HI> is un∣der age. And by the same manner we de∣fended our K<HI>ing,</HI> his [reputed] Father ha∣veing appointed <HI>Cardinal Mazarine</HI> for his Tutor and Governer till by force of Arms he was able to make his way to the Crowne, and if any are so Inquisitive as to ask if this Prince shall be brought to the Crowne by the same manner, let such know that it may be easily done for our King hath decla∣red that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> there is occasion he will stand by him with his whole fore and power.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly.</HI> That which administers great Joy to me and all the Fathers of our So∣ciety, is, that the <HI>King</HI> of great <HI>Brittain</HI> is resolved and hath also promised you that in case this Child should dye, there shall be another ready to put into the crad∣le in his place, but if that should prove difficult and that there should not be a Child readily found to carry on the show with some reputation, you must take the same course as before and send the <HI>King</HI> to <HI>St Winifreds</HI> well to wash that <HI>little</HI> he hath, let the <HI>Queen</HI> wear a <HI>Cushion upon her belly</HI> for nine months and that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> certainly produce another <HI>Prince of Wales.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fifthly.</HI> That his Majesty <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> given or∣ders <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all the priests to write to the for∣reigne Colledges and desire them to in treat the <HI>English Scotch</HI> and <HI>Irish</HI> and all other outlandish <HI>Catholicks,</HI> that are well inclind to advance and further the Kings pious designes: and to encourage every one that can with all speed to come over
<PB N="6" REF="000438_0006_0FA5AF2816CC6918"/>
into England: with promises that they shall all be advanced according to their several quallifications, which will be of great use for the carrying on this blessed work, defending the <HI>young Prince</HI> against his Conspireing Enemies, and to root out all the Hereticks. In which work I do promise not to be negligent, but ro send over as many as I can possibly per∣swade.</P>
<P>And now as these things are truely Joy∣ous in themselves, so have they in me and all the Fathers of our Society created an un expressible Joy. If I should tell you how I was affected when I heard this news, I could say no more but this, that my soul was separated from my body, and transported with Joy and gladnes into the paradis of the most high, which no man can conceive; as <HI>St. Paul</HI> writes of himself when he was taken up into the third heaven.</P>
<P>Now Concerning the question you have put to me, that is what is the best cours to be taken to root out all the <HI>Hereticks</HI>▪ to which I answer, there are divers ways to do that, bnt we must consider which is the best to make use oft in <HI>England,</HI> I am sure you are not Ignorant how many thousand <HI>Hereticks</HI> we have in france by the <HI>power of our Dragons</HI> converted in the space of one year: and by the Doctrin of those <HI>booted Apostles</HI> turnd more in one Month then <HI>Christ</HI> and his <HI>Apostles</HI> by their preaching could in ten year: this is a most Excellent method and far excells those of the <HI>great preachers</HI> and <HI>teachers</HI> that have lived since <HI>Christ,</HI> his time But I have spoke with divers <HI>Fathers of our So∣ciety</HI> who do think that your <HI>King</HI> is not strong enof to accomplish his designe by such kind of force. So that we cannot expect to have our work done in that manner for the <HI>Hereticks</HI> are to strong in the three <HI>Kingdoms,</HI> and therefore we must seek to convert them by fair means before we fall upon them with <HI>Fire Sword halters, Jailes</HI> and other such like punish∣ments. And therefore I can give you no better advice but to begin with Soft easy means, weedle them in by <HI>promises of pro∣fit</HI> and <HI>offices of Honor</HI> till you have made them <HI>dip</HI> themselves in treasonable actions against the Laws Established, and then they are bound to serve for fear: When they have done thus turn them out and serve others so by putting them in their places, and by this way gaine as many at you can: and for the <HI>Hereticks</HI> that are in places of profit or Honor turn out or su∣spend them on pretence of <HI>Misbehaviour,</HI> by which their places are forfeit and they subject to what Judgment you please to give upon them: then you must form a <HI>Camp</HI> that must consist of none but <HI>Ca∣tholikes</HI> this will make the <HI>Hereticks</HI> heartles and Conclude all means of releife or re∣covery is gone. And lastly take the short and the best way which is to <HI>surprise</HI> the <HI>Hereticks</HI> on a sudden; and to Incourage the <HI>Zealous Catholikes</HI> let them <HI>Sacrifice</HI> them all and <HI>wash their hands in their blood,</HI> which will be an acceptable <HI>offering to god:</HI> and this was the method I took in <HI>France</HI> which hath well you see succeeded: but it cost me many threatnings and Promises before I could bring it thus far, our <HI>King</HI> being a long time very un willing</P>
<P>But at last I got him on the hip: for he had <HI>Lay</HI> with his <HI>daughter in Law</HI> for which I would by no means give him <HI>ab∣solution</HI> till he had given me an <HI>Instrument</HI> under his owne hand and Seal to <HI>Sacrifice</HI> all the <HI>Hereticks</HI> in one day: Now as soon as I had my <HI>desired Commission</HI> I appointed the day when this should be done, and in the mean time made ready some thousands of Letters to be sent into all parts of <HI>France</HI> in one post night, I was never better pleased then at that time, but the <HI>King</HI> was a affected with some Compassion for the <HI>Hugonets</HI> because they had been a means to bring him to his Crowne and Throne: and the longer he was under it the more sorrowful he was, often complaining and desireing me to give him his Commission
<PB N="7" REF="000438_0007_0FA5AF28ED5FF780"/>
again but that I would by no perswasion do, adviseing him to repent of that hainous sinne, and also telling him that the trouble and Horror of his spirit did not proceed from any thing of evil in those things that were to be done, but from that great wickednes which he had done; and that he must resolve to undergo the severe burden of a troubled mind for one of them or the other, and if he would remaine Satisfied as it was, his sin being forgiven there would in a few days be a perfect atto∣nement made for it and he perfectly re∣conciled to god againe, but all this would not pacifie him for the longer the more Restles, and therefore I ordered him to retire to his closet and there spend his time Constantly in prayer without per∣mitting any one to interrupt him: and this was in the morning early when the Evening following I was to send away all my Letters, I did indeed make the more hast for fear he should disclose it to any one, yet I had given him a strickt Charge to keep it to himself, and the very thing that I most feared to my great sorrow came to pass, for Just in the nick of time the <HI>Divel</HI> who hath always his In∣struments at work sent the <HI>Prince of Conty</HI> to the court, who asked for the King, and it was told him that he was in his Closet and would speak with no man: he Impudently answered <HI>that he must and would speak with him:</HI> and so went directly to his Closet: he being a great Peer no man durst hinder him, and being come to the King he soon perceived by his Coun∣tenance that he was under some great trouble of mind for he looked as if he had been goeing into the other world Imediately: Sir [said he] what is the mat∣ter with you, the King at the first refu∣sed to tell him, but he pressing harder upon him, at last the King with a sor∣rowful Complainent burst out and said I <HI>have given Father la Chaise under my owne hand a Comission to murder, all the Hugonets in one day, and this Evening will the Letters be dispatcht to all paris by the post for the performing it: So that there is but small time left for my Hugonet subjects to live who have never done me any harm,</HI> whereupon this cursed Rogue answered, let him give you, your Comission againe: <HI>the King said how shall I get it out of his hand <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> I shall <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to him for it, he will refuse to send it:</HI> this devil Answered, If your Majesty will give me order I will quickly make him return it; the King was soon per∣swaded being willing to give Ease to his troubled spirit, and said: <HI>well goe then, and break his neck if he will not give it you,</HI> whereupon this son of the devil went to the Post house: and asked if I had not a great number of Letters there, and they said, yes more then I had sent thither in a whole year before, then said the Prince: <HI>by order from the King you must deliver them all to me:</HI> which they durst not deny, for they knew well enof who he was And no sooner was he got into the Post-house and had asked these questions, but I came also in after him, to give order to the Post-master to give notice to all those under him in the several parts of the Kingdom that they might take care to de∣liver my Letters with all speed imaginable. But I was no sooner come into the house but he gave his servants order to secure the door: and said confidently to me: <HI>You must by order from the King give me the Comission which you have, forced from him;</HI> I told him I had it not about me▪ but I would go and fetch it: thinking to get from him and so go out of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and send the contents of those Letters another time, but he said: <HI>You must give it me, and if you have it not about you▪ send some body to fetch it or els never Expect to go alive out of my hands, for I have an order from the King either <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> bring it or break your <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: and I am Resolved either to carry back that to him in my hand, or your hearts blood on the point of my sword:</HI> I would <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> my Escape but he set his sword to my breast and said <HI>you must give it <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or Dye, therefore deliver
<PB N="8" REF="000438_0008_0FA5AF29D5C2E470"/>
it or els this goeth through your body.</HI></P>
<P>So when I saw nothing els would do I put my hand in my pocket and gave it him, which he carried immediately to the <HI>King</HI> and gave him that and all my Letters which they burnt: and being all done the <HI>King</HI> said that now his heart was at Ease, now how he should be Eased by the <HI>devil,</HI> or so well satisfied with a fals Joy I can∣not tell▪ but this I know that it was a very wicked and ungodly action as well in his <HI>Majesty</HI> as the <HI>Prince of Conty:</HI> and did not a Little increase the burden and dan∣ger of his Majestys sins: I soon gave an account of this affair to several <HI>Fathers of our Society,</HI> who promised to doe their best to prevent the foresaid <HI>Prince</HI> doeing such another act, which was accordingly done: for with in the space of six days after the damned action he was <HI>Poisoned and well he deserved it.</HI> The <HI>King</HI> also did suffer to, but in another fashion, for discloseing the designe to the <HI>Prince</HI> and hearkning to his Council: and many a time since when I have had him at Con∣fession I have shook hell about his Ears, and made him sigh fear and tremble be∣fore I would give him absolution; nay more then that I have made him beg for it upon his knees before I would consent to absolve him, by this I saw that he had still an Inclination to me and was willing to be under my government: so I set the basenes of the action before him by tel∣ling the whole Story and how wicked it was▪ and that it could not be forgiven till he had done some good action to balance that and Expiate the crime, whereupon he at last asked me what he must doe? I told him that he must root out all the Hereticks from his Kingdom, so when he see there was no rest for him without doeing it, he did againe give them all into the power of me and our Clergy: under this Condition <HI>that we should not murder them;</HI> as he had before given orders; but that we should by fair means or force convert them to the <HI>Catholick Religion,</HI> to which End he gave us his <HI>Dragoons</HI> to be at our devotion and service that we might use them as we saw Convenient to convert them to the true Religion, now when we had got the Comission we presently put it in practise, and what the Issue of it hath been you very well know.</P>
<P>But now in <HI>England</HI> the work cannot be done after this manner: as you may perceive by what I have said to you, if you have carefully observed what hath been delivered, so that I can not give you better Council then to take that course in hand wherein we were so unhappily prevented, and I doubt not but it will have better succes with you then with us, and the rather because your <HI>King</HI> and his <HI>Son</HI> are under the government of our <HI>So∣ciety,</HI> and are to obey the orders of our Generall, and doe all that can be contri∣ved for the destroying the Hereticks, I would not be here understood as if I thought the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>England</HI> were unwil∣ling to prosecute and promote our orders and directions for the good of our holy mother the Church: and you must always keep him perfectly possest of that: for I know well that he of himself is Zealous enof, for that Excellent Example in <HI>Ire∣land</HI> that was done by his father [<HI>that is the murdering</HI> 200000 <HI>Protestants</HI>] is still so deeply printed in his soul that he had ra∣ther doe it to day then wait till to mor∣row, if he saw an advantagions oppor∣tunity, and I mention this story of Ire∣land that you may press it upon him and by that incourage him how easy a thing it is to do.</P>
<P>The reason why I am so long in rela∣teing this matter: is to let you know how we had at first laid our designe and also what obstructions there came in the way: yet at last we arrived at the thing we de∣sired, so you must not be disheartened when you meet with opposition but pro∣secute the thing, doe your duty and leave the succes to time and fate.</P>
<P>Our <HI>King</HI> is at present very sickly and
<PB N="9" REF="000438_0009_0FA5AF2BFA847FD0"/>
we can have no account what he ails, for sometimes the <HI>Doctors</HI> say he hath an <HI>Ague,</HI> a while after they say tis the <HI>Gout</HI> and then <HI>Melancholy</HI> or some such thing, now whit∣her the slow progres of the great designe in the Hague to get the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Orange</HI> into his Interest; <HI>or to murder him;</HI> doth so weaken and impair him, I know not. But this I can assure you of: that he be∣gan to be sick when he received the news of that provokeing answer that the Pensio∣naris <HI>Fagel</HI> gave to his Ambasador <HI>D' A∣vaux:</HI> and was after published in very Scornful terms; and therefore there was but little hope left to accomplish the first: and Indeed less to perform the second, seeing the Prince hath smelt out our Kings designe, and for all those that have intermedled in the affaires of our Amba∣sador concerning what he hath done for his master; let them look to themselves, possibly he may fear that their <HI>Majestys</HI> of great <HI>Brittain</HI> may alter their opinions about the young prince that we have been so long contriveing for, and at last disowne him, and so destroy the designe, and from thence may his sicknes proceed, for he is considerable better since he hath heard of its good succes and the probabillity of its good conclusion. And this is the more possible because his <HI>Majesty</HI> takes all his Measures from the Constitution of the affaires in <HI>England,</HI> &amp; undertakes nothing of any great importance till he considers how it stands with that <HI>King,</HI> [and you well know that we in the late troubles forbore to persecute the <HI>Hugnoets</HI> till we heard of his <HI>Majestys</HI> conquest and the defeat and death of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> and then we began againe very smartly] so hath he now li∣kewise do<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, as soon as he heard this news gave present orders that all those <HI>Hereticks</HI> who were not converted to the Catholick Religion by such a day should be offered up as a Sacrifice to the <HI>young Prince.</HI></P>
<P>And I would Intreat you against you write to me againe to Inquire and let me know of what <HI>Lady, Nun,</HI> or other <HI>Holy Virgin</HI> the <HI>young Prince</HI> was born: that I may remember her in my prayers who hath brought this hopefull babe into the world that is like to be the pillar of our Religion, and also send me word how old he was when he was <HI>brought to the Queen</HI> or as the Common cant is when he was born: for there is a Father of our Society that is very skilful in <HI>Astrology</HI> and would Calculate his Nativity.</P>
<P>I have Received a Letter out of the Hague by which I am told that in <HI>Holland</HI> they use very unreverend Expressions of the <HI>young Prince:</HI> one says that among all the Children you got for this designe there was not one found fit to be used, either they were <HI>sickly, deformed</HI> or born with some other <HI>ill accident:</HI> so that they say this is a <HI>Millers Son:</HI> others say it was a <HI>Carpenters Son in Holborn</HI> thereby intima∣teing a sacred miracle parallel to the holy Joseph who was of the same trade, others say the <HI>young Prince</HI> was a month old when he was born, and that he could presently eat pap with a spoon, and there are others who say he had six teeth in his mouth and immediately began to bite like a <HI>young De∣vil,</HI> which was the onely cause why they would not let him suck, but some others say that he suckt long enof before he was born, and should they now let him suck againe he would goe there to prove a <HI>who∣remonger;</HI> yet there are some that are more Rude and uncivil and report him to be the sonn of a <HI>Plowman,</HI> and say it is no wonder that he is so fat, big boned, and strong made; being designed by nature for the <HI>flaile</HI> and not for the <HI>Throne.</HI> Nay there be some here in <HI>France</HI> that tell us they have heard in the <HI>Taverns</HI> and <HI>Coffe∣houses</HI> nay and a long the streets also in Lon∣don as bad language as there and therefore you must as much as possible, endeavor to suppres these things, by giveing orders to <HI>the Marq: d' Albeville</HI> your <HI>Kings</HI> Envoy at the <HI>Hague</HI> to complaine of some par∣ticular
<PB N="10" REF="000438_0010_0FA5AF2C9A69E2F8"/>
men, and in <HI>London</HI> you must apprehend them, bring them to Justice and hang up one or two for an Example that dare talke thus.</P>
<P>I am also Informed that few or none of all the <HI>Heretick Bishops</HI> and <HI>ministers</HI> in the three Kingdoms will pray for the <HI>young Prince</HI> in their Churches, which if true is of ill consequence, and therefore you must endeavor to have it done: and all those Rebellious Hereticks that will not obey his Majestys absolute power in this and other cases must be turned out, and dealt with as I have in this Letter before shewed.</P>
<P>I would write to you of many other things but that I fear what is here already done doth detaine you to long, and I also well know that you have a weighty affair on your shoulders: and therefore your time is precious, so that you stand in need of the Grace of God and the prayers of all good men to assist you in it: wherefore I will conclude, and for you and all good Catholicks shew my will to the best of my power praying for you to God, to Mary the H. Mother of God; to all the Angels and to the Holy and blessed souls, that they may help you in your Necessity, from Paris July the 10 1688.</P>
<P>Postscript: as I was about to conclude this Letter there came an Expres from <HI>Cardinal Furstenburg</HI> to our <HI>King</HI> to let him know: that the <HI>Chapter</HI> had shewed themselves very much Inclined to Chuse <HI>Prince Clement of Bavaria</HI> to be <HI>Elector of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> his <HI>Holines</HI> haveing first quallified and then represented him for that purpose, whereupon the King was much discom∣pose: and I fear he will [by this News comeing to him] have his Ague againe, and indeed I am my self not a little concer∣ned at this News; for <HI>Prince William of Furstenburg</HI> would immediately have ente∣red into a league with our King to subdue <HI>Holland,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> then should we have had a brave opportunity to carry on our de∣signes in <HI>England</HI> and to make his <HI>Majesty</HI> of great <HI>Brittaine</HI> absolute over his subjects, but I must here conclude.</P>

<P>Here Curteous Reader thou hast word by word the Letter <HI>of la Chaise</HI> to Father <HI>Peters:</HI> being the two <HI>principal Traytors</HI> in this part of the world, and the most un∣satisfied suckers of <HI>Christian blood,</HI> here thou seest a proof of their unheard of <HI>Cheating</HI> and <HI>Cruelty,</HI> and if what you have already read in this Letter is not sufficient to convince you of that abominable cheat in the court of <HI>England,</HI> to bring in and impose <HI>a Popish Bastard</HI> upon the people for the <HI>Kings Son: Prince of Wales</HI> and heir to the <HI>Crowne</HI> I will presently better in∣form you and if you please but to make use of your Judgment and reason you will not have the least ground to doubt it.</P>
<P>That the King of England hath had a distemper in all his Limbes and members for more then twenty years which hath rendred him unfit to beget vitall Children Especially in the last fourteen or Sixteen years; for it happened some years after he came to England as he was lyeing at Anchor in <HI>Rotten-dam bay</HI> near <HI>Ninnyport</HI> in <HI>Bog-land</HI> by an accident let slip his cable and so fell foul of a <HI>Scotch fire ship,</HI> and in the heat of the broile before they could get their tackling clear, they both unhappyly took fire and yet were miraculously pre∣served to the great comfort of the whole nation: however by the misfortune of this adventure his lower Tier was so dam∣nified that he remains more fit for shew then service; but to lay by all dubious and dark Expressions take the story in plane terms which was thus.</P>
<P>There was a Scotch noble man whose name was <HI>Carnegie</HI> but his title <HI>South Esk</HI> who died the 19 day of February last, with this Gentlemans lady the <HI>King</HI> (who was then <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>York</HI>) had an Indecent con∣versation,
<PB N="11" REF="000438_0011_0FA5AF2D5A85BBE0"/>
the Earl parceiveing it was very much discontented and said to his Father who was then alive, that he would chalenge the <HI>Duke of York</HI> to give him satisfaction, but his father knowing on the one side It was against the law to Chalenge a Prince of the blood, and on the other that his son was more a Gentleman them to put up such a wrong, gave his son advice <HI>to pox his wife,</HI> and by so doeing he would <HI>pox the Duke</HI> also. The Earl his son approved of the Council and so went to a Bawdy house and des∣ired the old Matron to help him to the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> whore</HI> that was to be found, which she immediately provided; and haveing well warmed his codpeice he went home and bestowed it on his wife. Now so soon as he saw the work was done he re∣tired and put himself under the hands of a Doctor who restored him in a short time to his pristine health, the <HI>King</HI> [then Duke] perceiveing the Earl was from home made the best improvement he could of the opportunity, and away he went with all hast to his <HI>pickled Mistris</HI> to cool his Reins not dreaming of a <HI>snake in the Grass.</HI> A while after this was done the <HI>Duke</HI> began to besick; so was his <HI>dutchess</HI> and the <HI>Countess of South Esk</HI> and no body knew what was the matter with them, not one of the three haveing the least suspicion of the <HI>pox.</HI> The <HI>Countess</HI> was the first that was discovered to have that disease, which the <HI>Duke</HI> hearing began to beleeve <HI>himself</HI> and <HI>Dutchess</HI> peppered with the same spice, which then grew publick, and sent for the most s<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>llful <HI>pocky <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> to advise with about it, how they were cured you may guess: and it is sufficiently knowne [and the King can to his sorrow if he pleaseth testify it] that ever since he hath carried a <HI>half pik,</HI> and to this very day he Carrys so much of it about him that he is perfectly unable to get a <HI>sound Child,</HI> and it appears plainly since the year 1669 or 1670 [when he was almost dead with it] all his Children have dyed of that diseass in a miserable Condition, and it is Judged by all know∣ing men that it is Impossible for him to get a Child that shall live long after tis born <HI>Ergo.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. It is a thing unheard of among <HI>Physi∣cians</HI> that a woman should be let blood with in a few days of her delivery as the <HI>Queen</HI> was, and what is more that a woman should flood to Excess but a month before her delivery and yet bring a lusty Child Into the world as they say she did <HI>Ergo.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. That it is an Impossible thing for a new born Child to have an Issue as they say the young Prince hath; and yet sup∣posed to be but two days old, such a peece of non sense that any fool may discover the cheat of it, for before we can beleeve this: they must make us beleeve that <HI>popish Kings successors</HI> are of another kind of substance then other new born Children are: for the body of a Child of four: six or eight days old is not fit for a <HI>Chyrurgions Instrument,</HI> neither is there yet blood or other matter to flow from thence as is in that case Expected tho the body were full of Issues: <HI>Ergo.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. That it is a thing unpracticable in <HI>England</HI> to have the <HI>Queen</HI> delivered with∣out the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> of the <HI>Nobility,</HI> the <HI>Bishop of Canterbury,</HI> the <HI>Lord Mayor</HI> of <HI>London, English Gentlemen</HI> of note, and the <HI>for∣reigne Ministers</HI> being there by, as it was now, which is sufficient to make all people mistrust tis a <HI>peece of Roguery;</HI> and hath given Just cause to any Ingenious man to Judge the contrivers of this project to be fools in folio if there was no cheat in it, and that this small Creature was <HI>Son</HI> of the <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Queen</HI> and lawful Heir to the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> England,</HI> nay what is more, from the very first hour that they reported the Queen to be with Child, the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Scotch</HI> Nations and almost the whole world besides that heard of it: Concluded it was a cheat. Now what way was there to convince them of the truth of it, and to stop the
<PB N="12" REF="000438_0012_0FA5AF2E0D283D88"/>
Months of Gainsayers, but to take care to have it done Regular and publick ac∣cording, to the antient, Custom in that case, that all man kind might be satis∣fied it was true and Just, but Alas here was the <HI>popes</HI> finger in it and the <HI>French Kings</HI> to: Ergo.</P>
<P N="5">5. The subtilty they have used to have the Queen delivered in the eight month, and that with so much sudden∣nes as if she had not time to call any or give notice to those who ought to have been there, they Judging that the world will think from hence that she was cat∣ched at unawares. But alas this is so far from takeing off the suspicion that it doth much Increase it, for from thence all men must Judge that they made Choice of this opportunity to do it in a private corner in the Dark: it being not fit for the light, for such works and workers hate that, and you need not doubt but they were affraid that some <HI>persons of qual∣lity, Bishops,</HI> and others would have come [had they knowne of it] that they could not have hindred; and tho it was the custom yet they did not desire their Company on that occasion. Secondly, we must necessaryly, conclude it is a cheat; because all men know that a Child born in the eighth month can not be so perfect lusty and vigorous as one of nine months is; and all that have seen this Child say it is biger and lustyer then ever this Queen had any when she went full nine months, and indeed biger then any new born Child usually is. Thirdly; we have great reason to con∣clude it is a cheat, because all <HI>Physicians</HI> and <HI>Phylosophers</HI> do affirm that it is im∣possible for a Child born in the eighth month to live, but we need not go to those, for Common Experience tels us it is true. Therefore the <HI>Jesuites</HI> who have undertaken to cheat the whole world, should have laid this designe better and have let the Queen been deli∣vered in the seventh month, because a Child of the seventh month may and often times doth live, so that this would have been far more probable to have hid the villany seeing it lay in their power to let her be brought to bed when they pleased, but they did not think upon it, for their wisdom zeal and power hath cheated them, and the mighty <HI>providence of god</HI> hath awakned the world to see the vil∣lany of the <HI>Cheat:</HI> a <HI>Cheat</HI> Contrived and managed for no other end but to give the <HI>Inheritance</HI> of the <HI>Crowne</HI> to a stranger, <HI>to Cheat the heir,</HI> and preserve the <HI>papists</HI> from the hand of Justice, to which they and their accomplices have forfeited their Necks for their endeavoring to al∣ter the <HI>Religion,</HI> their <HI>breaking</HI> the laws, and for bringing in a <HI>Bastard</HI> to accom∣plish the work.</P>

<P>IT is not the least part of my trouble that I cannot enjoy the happines of they sweet conversation <HI>viva voce</HI> in these so pernicious days, whose Council and advice in things as well sacred as secular I value far above all the direction of Scripture and those who pretend to it; and thanks be to the Father of lights

we walk by a more unerring spirit then those who doat upon that <HI>dead Letter,</HI> and make a noise about that man that was crucified at Jerusalem, I need not tell thee how useles the <HI>dead Letter</HI> is especially where there is the <HI>light</HI> within and <HI>miracles</HI> without; nor how foolish it is to beleeve <HI>three persons</HI> in the trinity; nor how ignorant them people are that de∣pend on him they call <HI>Christ</HI> for their salvation; thou knowest these thing well and therefore they are to thee the less useful and indeed since I have so much to say to thee about other more weighty affaires I must omit these.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding our various disap∣poinments which we dayly meet with on every side, we keep as close to the Rule and method prescribed as any men in this great affair can do that must ingage with such opposition; the great point at present is that of our young Prince: which me thought would have done far better then it doth, for the Noblemen that are Hereticks laugh at it, the Gen∣try do not beleeve it, and the Common sort speak such scandalous words of him that I am ashamed to name them. By our last Letters from <HI>Holland</HI> we have, Received account that on July the 9th the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> d' Albeville</HI> our Envoy at the Hague made a great Entertainment there [for Joy of the <HI>young Prince'</HI>s birth] but it unluckily proved but a small one; for he made provision for about three hundred persons and there did not ap∣pear above twenty: and by the account I have I question whither there had been any there [Except the French and Por∣tugal Ambassadors] had not some very honest Loyal Gentlemen been then in the Hague who were Intending for Eng∣land. Among these three hundred he Expected one hundred of them to be women; but the number fell short and unhappily proved to be but seven or eight; of which four of them were very honest women of their bodys haveing onely a whisk with their tailes. As for the peo∣ple of quallity at that court there was none of them present at this Entertain∣ment: And should I but tell thee <HI>how Contemptibly</HI> they looked upon the whole matter, and the <HI>Ambasador</HI> also for doeing it, thou woulds Conclude that they had but a very <HI>Indifferent opinion</HI> of the <HI>young Prince,</HI> and what is more, the <HI>young Prince'</HI>s health was not drunk at the pu∣blick table; which shews either a great weakness in our <HI>Envoy</HI> or Els the guests were more in love with the wine, then the cause and occasion of their Meeting: and besides I hear he is forbid to be prayed for there in the number of the Royal family which makes me think they do mistrust or have heard something of the matter; and therefore by the next I desive a word or two of thy opinion and what is best to be done in the af∣fair.</P>
<P>But that which is more considerable and abusive to the Child was at Am∣sterdam the thursday following being July the 12th. O. S. where there was an ho∣nest fellow a Creature of ours that made an Entertainment with a supper wi∣ne, and fire works: which drew a great concourse of people to the place besides the Guests invited? the people were grumbling all the Evening and said [<HI>what must we have all this stir for a Bastard,</HI> and such Expressions; out after suffer they within the house offered some af∣front to the people, [the Mob, or Jan Hagel as they there callem] upon which the Mutiny began and the first attach was made by stones in at the windows, swearing they would pull the house downe for Joy the <HI>bastard</HI> was born: this put the Guests upon shifting for their lives, some crept into the Empty bottles, others got to the next houses and being night were taken for thieves, the good Catholicks puld out theire beads the three Kings of collen &amp;c. and began to pray: the <HI>women</HI> went through holes

with their feet foremost and so slipt their skins as a snake doth at Midsummer to the great astonishment of the beholders, and many of them were so ingenious that they crept through places where a cat could not go through: but that which is most pleasant of all: B. our old Consul who I am Informd began the Riot crept into a four Gallon Cask to save his life, thus you see what reputation our young Prince hath in other Countrys but the best <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is they are all Hereticks.</P>
<P>And for England, people or all sorts there are most scandalously abusive by undecent Expressions: some say he is a millers son: some, a Gardiners son, and others a Carpenters son, but all conclude <HI>he is a son <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a whore,</HI> they also say that as the Queen was goeing to Mass news was brought to her that the Child was come and therefore she must he brought to bed presently, others tell it for a positive truth that there was a Coachman swearing in <HI>St. James'</HI>s court a bout nine of the Clock in the morning and being asked what was the matter with him: he swore dam him he had brought two <HI>old Bawdes</HI> with a <HI>Bastard</HI> in a basket and they were gon and had given him but a shilling and he had almost kild his horses to make hast. And they also talk of the Queens Ap∣plying plaisters and takeing medecines to stop—but you know en of of that al∣ready, These and abundance more of such reports is the Common talk and beleef both of City and Country, and the lon∣ger the worse, and yet <HI>Brother Lob, Brother Alsop, Brother Cox</HI> and many of our freinds the <HI>Anabaptists</HI> take a great deal of Pains in their pulpits to pray for him, and preach up the great blessing that god in him hath bestowed upon the nation: and yet poor Gent∣lemen they are by the people counted <HI>Rogues</HI> for their pains which is very hard,</P>
<P>It is the advise and Council of most of our Catholick peers and other well wishers to the cause not to make to much hast, but <HI>Father Peters</HI> says it must be hastened for we do not know how little time we have to work and when the King dyes [which we fear] the work is at an End: Therefore it is Resolved to Cite the Bishops before the Eclesia∣stical▪ Comissioners againe and to proceed against them with all the force possible, and also to turn out the greatest part of the Clergy for disobedience and in their Roms to put in Non Conformist, and if they do not answer our Ends, or as soon as we see occasion we will turn out them and put in Roman Catholick priests, it was debated whither we should fol∣low the advice or not: to cut them all of at once, but upon Examining our <HI>Army and fleet,</HI> we do not think our selves strong enof nor the work yet fit for that Issue. And therefore we will yet talk of a <HI>Parliament</HI> in November, to which End we have our <HI>Trumpeters</HI> in all parts of the towne and some of them pardoned Rebels: these are to pro∣pound ways to the people for an Equi∣valent to their Test: and as one of them very well says <HI>take away the palisado and build a brick wall;</HI> which notion takes with many, but if things should not do to have a Parliament in November we shall by that time perhaps be able to come to the great work, and to that purpose in the mean time we will Entertaine all the popish officiers and souldiers we can get.</P>
<P>We also resolve to get in to the work such as have been pretended Enemies to the King formerly and these will do our work to our hearts content, for we have picked out a select number of them that Gape after honor and profit, and this they shall not want so long as we have need of their service: these are to take their degrees in preferment and rise as they deserve: the boldest follow riseth first, and he that can with sword, pen,

or Argument first destroy law and li∣berty is the bravest man: such are <HI>Ste∣ward, Williams</HI> and some new ones as faithful as they, whose names shall be published with their actions: it being to early to mention them yet, least they do as one of them hath done before, <HI>Run a way for fear.</HI></P>
<P>It is likewise resolved that In case this designe with the Non cons doth not take effect to get a Parliament for our purpose at the time appointed, to lay by all thoughts of smooth means and get in a good number of french privately and and so fall downe right to dragooning: for it is not thought convenient to dally any longer and in the mean time to take up all those we can have proof against, that speak treason against the Prince of Wales and whip hang or imprison them as we see Convenient for if we suffer the people to talk as we do: they will do the same when the Queen shall be brought to bed again [should we see it needful to let this Prince dye] of another Prince of Wales, for you know they must be all boys.</P>
<P>Tis further more resolved that toward the End of the year the King shall go againe to St. winifreds well and there pray and wash, and against his return the Queen shall prepare her vessel to try a second time how god will bless their Endeavors, and we doubt not but it will succeed well.</P>
<P>Tis also resolved that in case the King can not get the Test and penal lawes abbrogated to save his freinds harmles after his death, that there shall he always [under pretence of necessity for the na∣tions good] vessels of small burden ready to carry them away and save them from hanging: for we do Expect it if he dye; on a sudden.</P>
<P>I will not detaine thee longer least it may be troublesom to thee: and indeed my time will not permit me to stay longer for I am Just at the finishing of this to go and meet <HI>Brother Alsop: Cox: Jones, Nokes, Lob:</HI> the <HI>King</HI> and some others where we go to Consider of some Important affairs relateing to the Kings bussines.</P>
