</PUBLICATIONSTMT><NOTESSTMT><NOTE>Dated on p. 3: Quebeck, February 6. 1753; signed on p. 8: De Roche. Evidently spurious, the letter purports to discuss secret French designs on British North America, and was probably written and published to be used as anti-French propaganda. De Roche and L'Maine have not been identified.</NOTE><NOTE>Evans 7225</NOTE><NOTE>Microfiche. [New York : Readex Microprint, 1985] 11 x 15 cm. (Early American imprints.
