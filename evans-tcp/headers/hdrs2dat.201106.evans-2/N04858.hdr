</PUBLICATIONSTMT><NOTESSTMT><NOTE>Two impressions noted, distinguishable by errors in paging, and with slight variations in text. There are numerous variations in line endings and in the ornaments used. In one impression, p. 104, 257-341 are misnumbered 410, 247-322, 223, 324-331. In the other impression, p. 104 and 257-304 are correctly numbered; p. 305-341 are misnumbered 295-331. Both impressions were evidently reissued at London, with cancelled title pages dated 1753 (Evans 7125). Cf. Robinson, M.P. "A complete index to Stith's</NOTE><NOTE>History of Virginia."
