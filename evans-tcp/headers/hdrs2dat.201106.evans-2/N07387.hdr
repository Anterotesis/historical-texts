</PUBLICATIONSTMT><NOTESSTMT><NOTE>Attributed to James Lyon as likely author in the Dictionary of American biography. Erroneously attributed to Francis Hopkinson by Shipton &amp; Mooney. Hopkinson is possibly the author of the satirical A second edition (with necessary improvements, which now render the sense entirely plain) of The lawfulness, excellency, and advantage of instrumental music ... Philadelphia: Andrew Stewart, 1763, which despite its title, is entirely distinct from the present work.</NOTE><NOTE>Evans 9424</NOTE><NOTE>Hildeburn, C.R.  Pennsylvania, 1906</NOTE><NOTE>Microfiche.
