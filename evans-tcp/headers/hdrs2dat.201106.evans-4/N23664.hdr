</PUBLICATIONSTMT><NOTESSTMT><NOTE>Generally attributed to William Duane. Attributed by Evans to ---- Treziulney, on the basis of the following from the autobiography of Mathew Carey: "A Pole, by the name of Treziulney, who acted as book-keeper for Mr. Duane, wrote a pamphlet, the object of which was to prove the utter incapacity of General Washington, as displayed during the revolution." The present work, though harshly critical of Washington, does not discuss his competence during the Revolution.</NOTE><NOTE>Printer's name supplied by Evans.</NOTE><NOTE>Evans 31315</NOTE><NOTE>Microfiche.
