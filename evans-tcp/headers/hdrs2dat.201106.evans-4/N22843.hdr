</PUBLICATIONSTMT><NOTESSTMT><NOTE>A hostile account. The words "With a defence of his writings" were evidently used as a means of disarming Paine's friends. The pseudonym was wholly fictitious as Chalmers had no such degree, and no affiliation with the University of Pennsylvania. The degree was apparently intended to compete with Paine's honorary degree from that institution, and to lend dignity to the publication by making it appear the work of a clergyman. Cf. Conway's Life of Paine, 1892, p. xiv-xvi, 337-338.</NOTE><NOTE>Evans 30178</NOTE><NOTE>Microfiche. [New York : Readex Microprint, 1985] 11 x 15 cm. (Early American imprints.
