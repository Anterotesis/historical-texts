</PUBLICATIONSTMT><NOTESSTMT><NOTE>In reply to Cotton Mather's A companion for communicants, Boston 1690. The only known copy, held by the library of the American Congregational Association, is found bound preceding the anonymous Brief explications of truth &amp; error ... 1689, attributed to Henry Glover by Evans. As the present work is worded as an introduction to Brief explications, the author apparently intended the whole to be viewed as a response to Mather. But Mather's Communicant was published in 1690, and Brief Explications appeared</NOTE><NOTE>in 1689. Also, there are obvious printing differences between the letter and Brief explications. Cf. Holmes, T.J. Cotton Mather, v. 1, p. 172-173.</NOTE><NOTE>Title from caption title and opening lines of text.</NOTE><NOTE>Evans 510</NOTE><NOTE>Wing (2nd ed.) M2258B</NOTE><NOTE>Microfiche.
