[i.e., John Sherman?].</NOTE><NOTE>Described by Evans as the second edition, in which, "to save a signature when paper was imported and scarce, the matter contained in pages 36 to 38 of the first edition was compressed, in smaller type, in pages 39 and 40." However, Shipton &amp; Mooney describe this as the first of the two impressions, noting that the errata listed at foot of p. 40 in this impression have been corrected in the text of the impression of [4], 38, [2] p.
