</PUBLICATIONSTMT><NOTESSTMT><NOTE>The American Antiquarian Society copy is inscribed "-ather, D.D." in a contemporary hand following "J.M." on title page, and has consequently been attributed to Increase Mather. This attribution is refuted in Holmes, T.J. Increase Mather. Holmes identifies J.M. as the author of "Some proposals to benefit the Province" (Boston, 1720), and notes that Trumbull has suggested that this might have been Joseph Morgan.</NOTE><NOTE>Evans 2346</NOTE><NOTE>Microfiche.
