In the second, the title is in six lines, with no comma after "judges", "&amp;" for "and", and minor changes in the setting of first lines of text. Also, in the second state, the name of Samuel Richardson is substituted for that of Anthony Morris in the first line of the postscript.</NOTE><NOTE>Signed on p. 7: George Keith [and five others].</NOTE><NOTE>First issued as a broadside after which William Bradford, printer, and John McComb, tavern keeper and distributor, were arrested for publishing an alleged malicious and seditious work. A brief history of the arrest, and the warrant signed by five justices, is on p. 8. Bradford was later released by the new government of Colonel Fletcher who determined that the imprisonment was occasioned by a religious, not a political difference, and therefore illegal.</NOTE><NOTE>READEX NOTE: Evans 598 erroneously filmed in the place of 597.</NOTE><NOTE>Evans 598</NOTE><NOTE>Evans 599</NOTE><NOTE>Wing (2nd ed.)
