And now by revelation, hath opened the mystery contained in said book unto his servant John Rogers, who hath explained the same for the edification and comfort of his church and people, after a long and dark night of apostacy; the explanation being made so plain, that the eye of every spiritual reader may see how exactly things have come to pass, as they were foretold of by the prophecy of this Book: and may see by it all things which are yet to come, not only to the end of this world, but to the finishing of the world to come.</TITLE><AUTHOR> Rogers, John, 1648-1721.</AUTHOR></TITLESTMT><EXTENT>400dpi gray-scale TIFF page images</EXTENT><PUBLICATIONSTMT><PUBLISHER>University of Michigan Library</PUBLISHER><PUBPLACE>Ann Arbor, Michigan</PUBPLACE><DATE>2009 October</DATE><IDNO TYPE="notis">APZ0786</IDNO>
