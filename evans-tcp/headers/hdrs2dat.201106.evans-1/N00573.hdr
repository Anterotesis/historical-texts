</PUBLICATIONSTMT><NOTESSTMT><NOTE>The first collection of the laws of New York. The acts from Apr. 1691 to Apr. 1692 were probably printed during July and Aug. 1693; the acts passed from Aug. 14, 1692 to Sept. 1693 later. Remainder copies of three acts separately printed before this volume was begun (Evans 663, 665, 666), the catalogue of fees (Evans 673), and the title page and table were added when the volume was completed, probably in Jan. 1694. Cf. McMurtrie, D.C. New York printing MDCXXIII, 1928, p. 23-30.</NOTE><NOTE>READEX NOTE: THe New York Public Library copy either lacks the three separately published laws and the catalogue of fees, or, likelier, it was determined to film them only as separately issued.</NOTE><NOTE>Evans 703</NOTE><NOTE>Wing (2nd ed.)
