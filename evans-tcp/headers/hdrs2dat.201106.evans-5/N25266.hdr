However, reference made in the sermon to Shays' Rebellion (1786-87) indicates that some, if not all, of the sermon was composed after the event. Burroughs' Memoirs, referred to in the title, were first in 1798.</NOTE><NOTE>Publication statement supplied by Evans, though perhaps based on no more than the fact that True published Burroughs' Memoirs in 1798.</NOTE><NOTE>"The hymn."--p. 11.</NOTE><NOTE>Evans 33479</NOTE><NOTE>Microfiche.
