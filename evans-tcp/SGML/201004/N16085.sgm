<HEAD><HI>Ob&s;ervation on the Articles of Confederation,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>BY the&s;e Articles, it clearly appears to have been intended by the Parties, that Congre&s;s &s;hould be the &s;upreme &s;overeign Power, in all Ca&s;es, and that their Acts and Proceedings &s;hould be &s;upremely efficacious, as much as any &s;overeign Acts what&s;oever.&mdash;Some Per&s;ons may imagine, that no Acts can be Sovereign Acts, without a King, as in Great-Britain, and other Nations ruled by Kings; but it is not the Name or Per|&s;on of a King, which makes him the Sovereign, or which makes his Acts &s;upreme and ab&s;olute, but he becomes &s;overeign, and his Acts become &s;upreme, by the Con&s;titution, or by the People a&s;&s;enting to his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing and exerci&s;ing the &s;ove|reign and &s;upreme Power.&mdash;It is very plain, that a free People, of any Nation or Country, may lodge the &s;overeign and &s;upreme Authority, for their own Government, in a Number or Body of Men, without Regard to a King, or the Name of a King, or any &s;ingle Per&s;on.&mdash;It was accordingly meant by the Parties to the Articles of Confederation, that Congre&s;s &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s and exerci&s;e the &s;overeign and &s;upreme Power over all the United States in Confederation; and that without &s;uch Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and Exerci&s;e, the Union and Confederation of the States mu&s;t be defective and incomplete.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="020600_0003_0FB05146D4E0B230" MS="y">A few Remarks, taken from the Briti&s;h Union, may be of U&s;e, to ca&s;t &s;ome Light on the Ame|rican Articles of Union.&mdash;In the Union between England and Scotland, the Scotch retained their former Laws and their former Courts of Ju&s;tice; but after the Union, their Laws were to be all made in the Parliament of Great-Britain; for it would be incon&s;i&s;tent with the Idea of a complete Union, under one Legi&s;lature, of King, Lords, and Commons, legi&s;lating at We&s;tmin&s;ter, that the Scotch &s;hould, at Home, &s;till be their own Legi&s;lators, as before the Union; and though they con&s;idered that the King, Lords, and Commons, compo&s;ing the Legi&s;lature of England, were, by their Con&s;titution, as ab&s;olute, and might, on Occa&s;ions, be as arbitrary and oppre&s;&s;ive as the Grand Turk; and that after the Union, and even after the Acce&s;&s;ion of &s;ixty-one Members, &s;ixteen Lords, and forty-five Commoners from Scotland, the Briti&s;h Legi&s;lature would &s;till, by their Con|&s;titution, be as ab&s;olute as before, and might, on Occa&s;ions, be oppre&s;&s;ive; they neverthele&s;s, for the Sake of a complete and con&s;i&s;tent Union, cho&s;e to have their Repre&s;entatives in the Briti&s;h Parliament, and to have their Laws, in Time to come, from that Parliament; &s;tipulating at the &s;ame Time, that Laws concerning the Regulation of Trade, Cu&s;toms, and Exci&s;e, were to be the &s;ame in Scotland as in England; but all other Laws in U&s;e in Scotland, were to remain in Force after the Union, but alterable by the Parliament of Great-Britain; and that Laws concerning public
<PB N="4" REF="020600_0004_0FB05148799AC7C8">
Right, Policy, and civil Government, &s;hould be made the &s;ame throughout the whole united Kingdom, but no Alteration &s;hould be made in Laws concerning private Right, except for the evident Utility of the Subjects in Scotland.</P>
<P>Though the Circum&s;tances of the Briti&s;h Union were not &s;imilar to the Circum&s;tances of the American Union, and the Parties in the Briti&s;h Union were not <HI>in pari Ca&s;u</HI> with the Parties in the American Union, the main Point in the Bri|ti&s;h Union being to &s;ubject the Scotch to the Parliament of England, to be thereafter compo&s;ed of Engli&s;h and Scotch; and the Parties to the American Union having no King, Lords, or Com|mons to be &s;ubject to, or governed by, yet &s;till the following Remarks, ari&s;ing from the Con&s;ti|tution of the Briti&s;h Union, may be u&s;eful to &s;how the Defects of the American Union.</P>
<P N="1">I. If it had been re&s;erved to the Scotch, in &s;ome or any particular Ca&s;es or Ca&s;e, to make Regulations for them&s;elves, after the Union, and that in &s;uch particular Ca&s;es re&s;erved, the Parlia|ment of Great-Britain &s;hould not interfere; &s;uch a Re&s;ervation would have been incon&s;i&s;tent with the Union, and &s;hould &s;oon occa&s;ion much con|fu&s;ion.</P>
<P N="2">II. If the Briti&s;h Treaty for an Union, had only declared an Union generally, and that the King of England &s;hould, under &s;uch general Union, be the &s;ole Arbiter of Peace and War, for Scotland as well as England, and that the Scotch &s;hould aid and a&s;&s;i&s;t England in all Wars, offen&s;ive
<PB N="5" REF="020600_0005_0FB0514AA6FB7248">
and defen&s;ive; but without infringing or violating the legi&s;lative Right of Scotland, within its own Limits; &s;uch a Stipulation would be extremely ab&s;urd, and would &s;oon occa&s;ion much Confu&s;ion, becau&s;e if any legi&s;lative Right had been left with Scotland, after the Union, there would have been no End of legi&s;lating Pretentions, on various Emergencies and Occa&s;ions, nor any preci&s;e Boundary left between the legi&s;lative and executive Powers, under the Union.</P>
<P N="3">III. If the Articles of the Briti&s;h Union had &s;tipulated nothing concerning the Laws for the Regulation of Trade, Cu&s;toms, and Exci&s;e, or the Laws concerning public Right, Policy, and civil Government, and had not enacted that &s;uch Laws &s;hould, in Time coming, be the &s;ame in Scotland as in England, this would have occa&s;ioned the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion, by Laws for the Regulation of Trade, Cu&s;toms, and Exci&s;e and concerning pub|lic Right, Policy, and civil Government in Scot|land, being different from, and cla&s;hing with, or derogatory to tho&s;e Laws in England.</P>
<P>So much for Remarks upon the Briti&s;h Union, as a Kind of Introduction to the following Ob|&s;ervations on the Articles of the American Union, and tho&s;e Articles, in a political Sen&s;e, truly appear to be improperly penned, in various Par|ticulars herein after ob&s;erved upon:</P>
<P N="1">I. The Stipulation, that each State retains it's Sovereignty and Independence, &amp;c. (as in Article 1&s;t) appears to be wrong. Under the Idea of a political Union of thirteen &s;everal States confede|rating
<PB N="6" REF="020600_0006_0FB0514C0E4657B8">
together, the Sovereignty of any individual State ought not to have been con&s;idered or ex|pre&s;&s;ed to be retained by &s;uch individual State, becau&s;e no Sovereignty ought to be &s;uppo&s;ed to exi&s;t in any individual State after the Union, the only Sovereignty which could be u&s;eful or of Importance being the United Sovereignty, and of cour&s;e, the whole Sovereignty of the Thirteen United States ought to be lodged with, and con|centered in the Congre&s;s, as being the &s;upreme Body or Tribunal, con&s;tituted for the Purpo&s;e of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the united Sovereignties of the Thirteen &s;everal United States.</P>
<P N="2">II. If this is ju&s;t, it will appear, that after the Union, no individual State ought to be it's own Legi&s;lator, but that the Laws of each State ought to be made and pa&s;&s;ed in Congre&s;s.&mdash;Perhaps this would not have been reli&s;hed by the individual States, at the Time of the Articles of Union entered into; but now, after &s;ome Experience had under tho&s;e Articles, during which Experience, various Events are &s;aid to have happened, to &s;how the Inconvenience of individual States making their own Laws, <HI>ad Libitum,</HI> without regarding Con|gre&s;s; perhaps the individual States will not con&s;ider an Alteration to be made in this Re&s;pect, either by them&s;elves or Congre&s;s, &s;everally or jointly, as any Infringement or Violation of the legi&s;lative Right of any individual State, but will con&s;ider it as a proper and even nece&s;&s;ary Altera|tion for the Benefit of the Union, and for render|ing it more con&s;i&s;tent and more complete.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="7" REF="020600_0007_0FB0514DD34C23C8">III. If it is con&s;idered to be too much for indi|vidual States to give up what is called their So|vereignty, their legi&s;lative Right, &s;till they may be willing and &s;atisfied to have the Exerci&s;e of &s;uch their &s;overeign and legi&s;lative Rights modi|fied and abridged, or limited &s;o far that no Law or Laws, Regulation or Regulations, to be made by any individual State, in Time coming, &s;hall be valid, or of any Force or Effect, without the A&s;&s;ent of Congre&s;s fir&s;t had and interpo&s;ed there|unto.&mdash;If this Matter is &s;uffered to continue, as it was left, under the Articles of Union, it will then be clear, that the individual States of the Union chu&s;e to keep up an ab&s;urd <HI>Imperium in Imperio,</HI> by individual Sovereignties, and legi&s;la|tive Rights, militating again&s;t, and de&s;tructive of the Authority of Congre&s;s, which ought to be the only &s;overeign, &s;upreme, and ab&s;olute Autho|rity, over, in, and throughout every Part of the United States.</P>
<P>Upon this Head it is unnece&s;&s;ary to mention the natural Di&s;tinctions between Laws and Re|gulations of one Kind and tho&s;e of another Kind, between the Laws for the Regulation of Trade, Cu&s;toms, and Exci&s;e, and the Laws concerning public Right, Policy, and civil Government, or to mention that &s;uch Laws and Regulations ought to be the &s;ame every where, throughout the Whole of the United States, becau&s;e the Thing is plain and obvious; and if the Doctrine above laid down, is applied to the making an Alteration in the Exerci&s;e of Legi&s;lation, &s;uch Alteration will
<PB N="8" REF="020600_0008_0FB0514F1D3ED4E8">
prevent or remedy the Inconveniencies ari&s;ing from the former Exerci&s;e of Legi&s;lation, under the Articles of Union, as well in Regard to Laws for the Regulation of Trade, Cu&s;toms, and Exci&s;e, as Laws concerning public Right, Policy, and civil Government.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;e that is &s;aid to have happened in the State of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, after that State had made a Navigation Act, &s;ubjecting all Foreigners to pay double Duties, a heavy Tonage, and high Light-Money, in the Ports of that State, is a deplorable In&s;tance of the Ab&s;urdity of any individual State making Laws for it&s;elf, for impo&s;ing Duties on Ships and Merchandize, when, in the Ports of other individual States of the Union, no &s;uch Du|ties had been impo&s;ed, or exi&s;ted; and the Con|&s;equence was, that every foreign Ship de&s;tined for the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, during the Continuance of the &s;aid Duties, went to other Ports, where they could deal to greater Advantage, and thereby Merchan|dize of immen&s;e or very con&s;iderable Value, which would have been exchanged for the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Produce, to the great Increa&s;e of their Revenue, was diverted into other Channels, and lo&s;t to the State of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts.</P>
<P>This Ca&s;e alone (though there are other ab&s;urd Ca&s;es which might be &s;tated) is &s;ufficient to &s;how the Nece&s;&s;ity and Propriety of Congre&s;s being the &s;ole Legi&s;lators, in commercial Matters, for all and every of the States, and al&s;o to &s;how, that the commercial Laws and Regulations of all the States of the Union, ought to be the &s;ame
<PB N="9" REF="020600_0009_0FB05153B3AC8400">
throughout, for that otherwi&s;e it will always be in the Power of individual States to take Advan|tage of, and &s;harp upon other States, as much as if they were di&s;united States.</P>
<P><HI>Sharping</HI> being here mentioned, it may not be impertinent to touch upon a Practice had in &s;ome States, of decrying and depreciating, and refu&s;ing to take the Paper Money of other States, in Pay|ments, unle&s;s a certain Di&s;count is allowed by the Tenderer of &s;uch Paper Money to the Ten|deree or Per&s;on who is to receive the &s;ame. Of this Kind of Traffic there have lately been glaring In&s;tances, in Regard to the Paper Money of the State of <HI>New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> which the Dealers in New-York, and even New-Jer&s;ey-Men them&s;elves, refu&s;ed, and &s;till do refu&s;e, to take, except upon a Di&s;count of at lea&s;t one Penny in every Shilling; and by artful Management, this Practice has been extended &s;o as to introduce a Variety of Tricks and Frauds into different Dealings and Tran&s;actions. From &s;uch Practice it mu&s;t be obvious that art|ful Dealers have it in their Power to decry and depreciate the Paper Money of any State, and thereby to <HI>Sharp</HI> upon innocent and plain Per&s;ons at every Turn, and on all Occa&s;ions of their Dealing. One Way to prevent &s;uch Practice for the future might be, for Congre&s;s, by an Act, to declare that all Paper Money, or Bills for Money on Credit, emitted by any individual State, in Time coming, &s;hall be aided, countenanced, and &s;upported by the Credit of the United States&punc; and where any individual State &s;hall ultimately be|come
<PB N="10" REF="020600_0010_0FB05156D97FCD30">
deficient in Credit, or in the &s;atisfying of Demands upon them, on Account of their Paper Money, that &s;uch Deficiency &s;hall ultimately be made a Charge again&s;t the United States, which they &s;hall be an&s;werable to pay, and the deficient State &s;hall be bound to relieve and indemnify the United States, of and from all Deficiency, in the be&s;t and mo&s;t expeditious Manner that &s;uch defi|cient State can relieve and indemnify the United States.&mdash;Another Way to di&s;courage, if not to prevent the abovementioned Practice, might be by an Act to be pa&s;&s;ed by Congre&s;s, making it a public Offence and Mi&s;demeanor, in and for any Per&s;on or Per&s;ons to decry or depreciate, or pre|vent the Currency of the Paper Money of any individual State, or to take any Di&s;count on any Paper Money of any individual State, and making it lawful for any Per&s;on or Per&s;ons inhabiting in any of the United States, to &s;ummon the Of|fender and Offenders in the Premi&s;es, to appear before any one or two or more Ju&s;tices acting in the State where the Offender re&s;ides; and upon Proof being made of the Offence, by the Oath of one or more credible Witne&s;&s;es, the Ju&s;tice or Ju&s;tices taking Cognizance of the Offence, to fine the Offender in any Sum not exceeding Twelve Pounds Currency, to be paid to the Per&s;on or Per&s;ons complaining, be&s;ides his or their rea&s;ona|ble Charges and Co&s;ts in that Behalf &s;u&s;tained. And upon the Offender neglecting or refu&s;ing to pay &s;uch Fine and Co&s;ts, making it lawful for &s;uch Ju&s;tice and Ju&s;tices to commit the Offender to the next Gaol, there to continue impri&s;oned till he pays the Fine and Co&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="020600_0011_0FB051599807A838">So much concerning a Practice not provided again&s;t by the Articles of Confederation, may be deemed a Digre&s;&s;ion; but now to return to the Ob&s;ervations on the penning of the American Articles.</P>
<P N="4">IV. It appears to be &s;tipulated, that in deter|mining Que&s;tions in the United States in Con|gre&s;s a&s;&s;embled, each State &s;hall have one Vote, (as in Article 5th) But this appears to be wrong; for that a State twice as large and twice as popu|lous as another State, ought to have two Votes, when the le&s;&s;er State has only one Vote, and the lea&s;t or &s;malle&s;t State mu&s;t certainly have one Vote; but the larger, more exten&s;ive, more con&s;iderable, and more re&s;pectable States, ought to have more than one Vote, ought to have two, or three, or four, or more Votes, in Proportion to the Diffe|rence between a con&s;iderable or large State, and a &s;maller State. To maintain otherwi&s;e, is to di&s;|regard an equal and fair Repre&s;entation of the States by their Delegates in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled. But if more than one Vote is to be allowed to &s;ome States, &s;till it will not be nece&s;&s;ary to cau&s;e tho&s;e States to &s;end a Delegate for each Vote they may become intitled to; for that if they have but one Delegate attending in Congre&s;s, &s;uch one Delegate may vote as many Times as his Con&s;ti|tuents are intitled to vote on any Que&s;tion.</P>
<P N="5">V. Where it is provided, that no Treaty of Commerce &s;hall be made, whereby the legi&s;lative Power of the re&s;pective States &s;hall be re&s;trained from impo&s;ing &s;uch Impo&s;ts and Duties on Fo|reigners,
<PB N="12" REF="020600_0012_0FB0515B20DBD1C8">
as their own People are &s;ubjected to, or from prohibiting the Exportation or Importation of any Species of Goods or Commodities what&s;o|ever (as in Article 9th.) It appears to be mo&s;t improperly expre&s;&s;ed and penned; for that no Treaty of Commerce ought to be made, or per|mitted to be made or entered into, by any Power, other than the Congre&s;s, and no individual State ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s a legi&s;lative Power of impo&s;ing Duties on Foreigners, or of prohibiting the Ex|portation or Importation of any Goods or Com|modities, all which ought to be left to Congre&s;s, as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the &s;overeign and united legi&s;lative Powers of all the individual States; and under this Head of Ob&s;ervations, what has been men|tioned above, in the 3d Head of Ob&s;ervations, will forcibly apply.</P>
<P N="6">VI. That the United States in Congre&s;s a&s;|&s;embled, &s;hould be the la&s;t Re&s;ort, on Appeal, in all Ca&s;es (as in the &s;aid Article 9th) appears to be right and proper; but then there is no Provi&s;ion made for enforcing the Deci&s;ions or Determinati|ons of Congre&s;s, or for carrying them into Exe|cution or Effect; and &s;uch Provi&s;ion may have been de&s;ignedly omitted, by the Opinion of &s;ome Per&s;on or Per&s;ons concerned in the penning of the Articles, who might con&s;ider &s;uch a Provi&s;ion unnece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e it is a Principle or Rule in Law, that where a Juri&s;diction is given to any Per&s;on, or a Body of Per&s;ons, to determine Mat|ters in Controver&s;y or Di&s;pute between Parties, it follows by Con&s;equence, that the Per&s;on, or
<PB N="13" REF="020600_0013_0FB0515DECB15C48">
Body of Per&s;ons intitled to the Juri&s;diction, mu&s;t have an inherent Right to render their Juri&s;dic|tion effectual, and to have their Deci&s;ions and Determinations enforced and carried into due Execution, by all the Ways and Means in Law, u&s;ual or practicable for enforcing the Deci&s;ions and Determinations of any Juri&s;diction whatever. But as this Principle, or Rule of Law, is recon|dite, and not obvious to every Per&s;on, or any Per&s;ons not learned in the Law, it would be better to have an expre&s;s Provi&s;ion for enabling Congre&s;s to enforce their Deci&s;ions, and carry them into Execution. For this Purpo&s;e a Law may be pa&s;&s;ed by Congre&s;s, enacting, that in all Ca&s;es of Deci&s;ions or Determinations made by Congre&s;s, upon Matters of Controver&s;y or Di&s;pute between one individual State and another State, or more individual States, the State or States refu&s;ing or declining to obey and conform to &s;uch Deci&s;ions and Determinations, or to acquie&s;ce therein, &s;hall be deemed guilty of the highe&s;t Contempt again&s;t the &s;overeign Authority of Congre&s;s, and making it lawful for Congre&s;s to puni&s;h any refractory State or States, by and with &s;uch high Penalties, Fines, or Amerciaments, for their Contempt, as &s;uch their Contempt may appear to Congre&s;s to de&s;erve: And al&s;o making it lawful to and for any Per&s;on or Per&s;ons, to be appointed by Con|gre&s;s for that Purpo&s;e, to attach any two or more of the mo&s;t reputable and mo&s;t re&s;pon&s;ible Inha|bitants of and in &s;uch refractory and di&s;obedient State or States, and the Per&s;ons &s;o attached to be
<PB N="14" REF="020600_0014_0FB0515EDC71C0E8">
an&s;werable for the Whole of the State or States they belong to, and liable to pay &s;uch Fines, Penalties, and Amerciaments, as &s;hall, by Con|gre&s;s, be impo&s;ed on the delinquent State or States; but the Per&s;on and Per&s;ons &s;o an&s;wering and paying for the delinquent State or States, to be reimbur&s;ed and indemnified by the re&s;pective State or States, according to the Rules and U&s;age of Law, in Ca&s;es where a certain &s;mall Number of Per&s;ons in a State, County, Pari&s;h, or other Di&s;trict <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> attached to an&s;wer for the Whole.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Where it is declared, that the United States in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled, &s;hall never engage in a War, &amp;c. unle&s;s nine States a&s;&s;ent to the &s;ame (as in Part of the &s;aid Article 9th). It appears wrong and ab&s;urd; for it is plain, that the &s;overeign, &s;upreme, and ab&s;olute Power was properly intended to be lodged, and ought to be lodged with Congre&s;s; and their Re&s;olves and Engagements, whether concerning a War, or any other public Matter, ought, in all Ca&s;es, to go by a Majority of the Votes or Voices of the de|legated Members, pre&s;ent and acting at the Time, and in no Re&s;olve or Engagement, ought the A&s;|&s;ent of nine States to be con&s;idered as nece&s;&s;ary or proper, but on the contrary unnece&s;&s;ary and improper; becau&s;e, in many Ca&s;es, and on ma|ny Occa&s;ions of Importance, it might happen, that Nine States, out of Thirteen, might not have their Delegates pre&s;ent in Congre&s;s, which might &s;top, impede, and even defeat, &s;ome very important Re&s;olve, however nece&s;&s;ary it might
<PB N="15" REF="020600_0015_0FB0516059359530">
be for the public Good to have it pa&s;&s;ed in&s;tant|ly.</P>
<P>Here it may appear pertinent to mention one other Defect of the Articles of Union, which is, that Congre&s;s, in any Part of the Articles, is not ve&s;ted with any Power or Controul over any of its own Members, and it has been &s;aid, that any Member, on the Principle of Law, that <HI>Inter Pares nulla Pote&s;tas,</HI> may leave Congre&s;s, when|ever he plea&s;es, without Leave from Congre&s;s, or the State he repre&s;ents; and that there has been an In&s;tance, of a late Que&s;tion before Congre&s;s, being lo&s;t by the wilful Ab&s;ence of a Member. If it has been &s;o, it mu&s;t be con&s;idered an egre|gious Defect in the Articles of Union, for it is believed, that this has been the fir&s;t In&s;tance in the World, of a &s;overeign and &s;upreme Juri&s;|diction, conferred on a Body of Men, and at the &s;ame Time leaving them without any Power or Authority over their own individual Members. In various Juri&s;dictions, in different Countries, it has frequently happened, that individual Mem|bers, have been attached, fined, and even im|pri&s;oned for Ab&s;ence, Neglect, and Contempt of Duty; and &s;o it ought to be in Congre&s;s, and &s;uch Power ought to be a&s;&s;umed by Congre&s;s, as a Matter of Cour&s;e, incident to, and inherent in their Juri&s;diction; but if it is weakly con|&s;idered, that Congre&s;s cannot exerci&s;e any Power or Authority over their own Members, without an expre&s;s Law for that purpo&s;e; &s;uch Law may ea&s;ily be pa&s;&s;ed by Congre&s;s, making it a high
