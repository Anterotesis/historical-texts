<HEAD>A VIEW OF THE INTERNAL EVIDENCE OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>MOST of the writers, who have undertak|en to prove the divine origin of the Chri|&s;tian Religion, have had recour&s;e to arguments drawn from the&s;e three heads: the prophecies &s;till extant in the Old Te&s;tament, the miracles recorded in the New, or the internal evidence ari&s;ing from that excellence, and tho&s;e clear marks of &s;upernatural interpo&s;ition, which are &s;o con&s;picuous in the religion it&s;elf: The two for|mer have been &s;ufficiently explained and inforced by the able&s;t pens; but the la&s;t, which &s;eems to carry with it the greate&s;t degree of conviction, has never, I think, been con&s;idered with that attention, which it de&s;erves.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="016812_0003_0F9E7F0EAC92A8E8">
I mean not here to depreciate the proofs ari&s;ing from either prophecies, or miracles: they both have or ought to have their proper weight; pro|phecies are permanent miracles, who&s;e authority is &s;ufficiently confirmed by their completion, and are therefore &s;olid proofs of the &s;upernatural origin of a religion, who&s;e truth they were in|tended to te&s;tify; &s;uch are tho&s;e to be found in various parts of the &s;criptures relative to the coming of the Me&s;&s;iah, the de&s;truction of Jeru|&s;alem, and the unexampled &s;tate in which the Jews have ever &s;ince continued, all &s;o circum|&s;tantially de&s;criptive of the events, that they &s;eem rather hi&s;tories of pa&s;t, than predictions of future tran&s;actions; and whoever will &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider the immen&s;e di&s;tance of time between &s;ome of them and the events which they foretell, the un|interrupted chain by which they are connected for many thou&s;and years, how exactly they cor|re&s;pond with tho&s;e events, and how totally un|applicable they are to all others in the hi&s;tory of mankind; I &s;ay, whoever con&s;iders the&s;e circum|&s;tances, he will &s;carcely be per&s;uaded to believe, that they can be the productions of preceding artifice, or po&s;terior application, or can entertain the lea&s;t doubt of their being derived from &s;uper|natural in&s;piration.</P>
<P>The miracles recorded in the New Te&s;tament to have been performed by Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;|tles, were certainly convincing proofs of their divine commi&s;&s;ion to tho&s;e who &s;aw them; and as they were &s;een by &s;uch numbers, and are as well atte&s;ted, as other hi&s;torical facts, and above all, as they were wrought on &s;o great and &s;o wonderful an occa&s;ion, they mu&s;t &s;till be admit|ted
<PB N="5" REF="016812_0004_0F9E7F10CE312208">as evidence of no incon&s;iderable force; but, I think, they mu&s;t now depend for much of their credibility on the truth of that religion, who&s;e credibility they were at fir&s;t intended to &s;upport. To prove therefore the truth of the Chri&s;tian Religion, we &s;hould begin by &s;hewing the inter|nal marks of Divinity, which are &s;tamped upon it; becau&s;e on this the credibility of the prophe|cies and miracles in a great mea&s;ure depends; for if we have once rea&s;on to be convinced, that this religion is derived from a &s;upernatural origin, prophecies and miracles will become &s;o far from being incredible, that it will be highly probable, that a &s;upernatural revelation &s;hould be foretold, and inforced by &s;upernatural means.</P>
<P>What pure Chri&s;tianity is, dive&s;ted of all its ornaments, appendages, and corruption, I pre|tend not to &s;ay; but what it is not, I will venture to affirm, which is, that it is not the offspring of fraud or fiction: &s;uch on a &s;uperficial view, I know it mu&s;t appear to every man of good &s;en&s;e, who&s;e &s;en&s;e has been altogether employed on other &s;ubjects; but if any one will give him&s;elf the trouble to examine it with accuracy and can|dour, he will plainly &s;ee that however fraud and fiction may have grown up with it, yet it never could have been grafted on the &s;ame &s;tock, nor planted by the &s;ame hand.</P>
<P>To a&s;certain the true &s;y&s;tem, and genuine doctrines of this religion, after the undecided controver&s;ies of above &s;eventeen centuries, and to remove all the rubbi&s;h, which artifice and ignorance have been heaping upon it during all that time, would indeed be an arduous ta&s;k, which I &s;hall by no means undertake; but to
<PB N="6" REF="016812_0005_0F9E7F11B4D03BB0">&s;hew, that it cannot po&s;&s;ibly be derived from human wi&s;dom, or human impo&s;ture, is a work, I think, attended with no great difficulty, and requiring no extraordinary abilities, and there|fore I &s;hall attempt that, and that alone, by &s;tating, and then explaining the following plain, and undeniable propo&s;itions.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, that there is now extant a book intitled the New Te&s;tament.</P>
<P>Secondly, that from this book may be extract|ed a &s;y&s;tem of religion intirely new, both with regard to the object and the doctrines, not only infinitely &s;uperior to, but unlike every thing, which had ever before entered into the mind of man.</P>
<P>Thirdly, that from this book may likewi&s;e be collected a &s;y&s;tem of ethicks, in which every moral precept founded on rea&s;on is carried to a higher degre of purity and perfection, than in any other of the wi&s;e&s;t philo&s;ophers of preceding ages; every moral precept founded on fal&s;e prin|ciples is totally omitted, and many new precepts added peculiarly corre&s;ponding with the new ob|jects of this religion.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, that &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of religion and mo|rality could not po&s;&s;ibly have been the work of any man, or &s;et of men; much le&s;s of tho&s;e ob|&s;cure, ignorant, and illiterate per&s;ons, who actu|ally did di&s;cover, and publi&s;h it to the world; and that therefore it mu&s;t undoubtedly have been effected by the interpo&s;ition of divine power, that is, that it mu&s;t derive its origin from God.</P>

<HEAD>PROPOSITION I.</HEAD>
<P>VERY little need be &s;aid, to e&s;tabli&s;h my fir&s;t Propo&s;ition, which is &s;ingly this: that there is now extant a book intitled the New Te&s;|tament: that is, there is a collection of writings di&s;tingui&s;hed by that denomination, containing four hi&s;torical accounts of the birth, life, actions, di&s;cour&s;es and death of an extraordinary per&s;on named Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who was born in the reign of Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar, preached a new religion throughout the country of Judaea, and was put to a cruel and ignominious death in the reign of Tiberius. Al&s;o one other hi&s;torical account of the travels, tran&s;actions, and orations of &s;ome mean and illiterate men, known by the title of his apo&s;tles, whom he commi&s;&s;ioned to propagate his religion after his death; which he foretold them he mu&s;t &s;uffer in confirmation of its truth. To the&s;e are added &s;everal epi&s;tolary writings, addre&s;&s;ed by the&s;e per&s;ons to their fellow-labourers in this work, or to the &s;everal churches or &s;ocie|ties of chri&s;tians, which they had e&s;tabli&s;hed in the &s;everal cities through which they had pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>It would not be difficult to prove, that the&s;e books were written &s;oon after tho&s;e extraordinary events, which are the &s;ubjects of them; as we find them quoted, and referred to by an uninter|rupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of writers from tho&s;e to the pre&s;ent times: nor would it be le&s;s ea&s;y to &s;hew, that the truth of all tho&s;e events, miracles only excepted, can no more be rea&s;onably que&s;tioned, than the truth of any other facts recorded in any
<PB N="8" REF="016812_0007_0F9E7F1323CA4EC8">hi&s;tory whatever: as there can be no more rea&s;on to doubt, that there exi&s;ted &s;uch a per&s;on as Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;peaking, acting, and &s;uffering in &s;uch a manner as is there de&s;cribed, than that there were &s;uch men as Tiberius, Herod, or Pontius Pilate, his cotemporaries, or to &s;u&s;pect, that Pe|ter, Paul, and James were not the authors of tho&s;e epi&s;tles, to which their names are affixed, than that Cicero and Pliny did not write tho&s;e which are a&s;cribed to them. It might al&s;o be made appear, that the&s;e books having been wrote by various per&s;ons at different times, and in di&s;t|ant places, could not po&s;&s;ibly have been the work of a &s;ingle impo&s;tor, nor of a fraudulent combi|nation, being all &s;tamped with the &s;ame marks of an uniform originality in their very frame and compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>But all the&s;e circum&s;tances I &s;hall pa&s;s over unob&s;erved, as they do not fall in with the cour&s;e of my argument, nor are nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;up|port of it. Whether the&s;e books were wrote by the authors who&s;e names are perfixed to them, whether they have been enlarged, dimini&s;hed, or any way corrupted by the artifice or ignorance of tran&s;lators, or tran&s;cribers; whether in the hi&s;to|rical parts the writers were in&s;tructed by a perpe|tual, a partial, or by any in&s;piration at all; whe|ther in the religious and moral parts, they received their doctrines from a divine influence, or from the in&s;tructions and conver&s;ation of their ma&s;ter; whether in their facts or &s;entiments there is always the mo&s;t exact agreement, or whether in both they &s;ometimes differ from each other; whether they are in any ca&s;e mi&s;taken, or always infallible; or ever pretended to be &s;o, I &s;hall not here di&s;|pute:
<PB N="9" REF="016812_0008_0F9E7F13EED82C18">let the Dei&s;t avail him&s;elf of all the&s;e doubts and difficulties, and decide them in con|formity to his own opinions, I &s;hall not contend, becau&s;e they affect not my argument; all that I a&s;&s;ert is a plain fact, which cannot be denied, that &s;uch writings do now exi&s;t.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>PROPOSITION II.</HEAD>
<P>MY &s;econd propo&s;ition is not quite &s;o &s;imple, but I think, not le&s;s undeniable than the former, and is this: That from this book may be extracted a &s;y&s;tem of religion intirely new, both with regard to the object, and the doctrines, not only infinitely &s;uperior to, but totally unlike every thing which had ever before entered into the mind of man: I &s;ay extracted, becau&s;e all the doctrines of this religion having been deliver|ed at various times, and on various occa&s;ions, and here only hi&s;torically recorded, no uniform or regular &s;y&s;tem of theology is here to be found; and better perhaps it had been, if le&s;s labour had been employed by the learned, to bend and twi&s;t the&s;e divine materials into the poli&s;hed forms of human &s;y&s;tems, to which they never will &s;ub|mit, and for which they were never intended by their great author. Why he cho&s;e not to leave any &s;uch behind him we know not; but it might po&s;&s;ibly be, becau&s;e he knew, that the imperfec|tion of man was incapable of receiving &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem, and that we are more properly, and more &s;afely conducted by the di&s;tant, and &s;cat|tered rays, than by the too powerful &s;un&s;hine of divine illumination: <Q>If I have told you earthly
<PB N="10" REF="016812_0009_0F9E7F149F327728">things, &s;ays he, and you believe not, how &s;hall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John iii. 12.</NOTE></Q> that is, if my in&s;tructions concern|ing your behaviour in the pre&s;ent as relative to a future life, are &s;o difficult to be under&s;tood, that you can &s;carcely believe me, how &s;hall you be|lieve, if I endeavoured to explain to you the na|ture of cele&s;tial Beings, the de&s;igns of Provi|dence, and the my&s;teries of his di&s;pen&s;ations; &s;ubjects which you have neither ideas to compre|hend, nor language to expre&s;s?</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, the object of this religion is intirely new, and is this, to prepare us by a &s;tate of probation for the kingdom of heaven. This is every where profe&s;&s;ed by Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles to be the chief end of the chri&s;tian's life; the crown for which he is to contend, the goal to which he is to run, the harve&s;t which is to pay him for all his labours: Yet previous to their preaching no &s;uch prize was ever hung out to mankind, nor any means pre&s;cribed for the at|tainment of it.</P>
<P>It is indeed true, that &s;ome of the philo&s;ophers of antiquity entertained notions of a future &s;tate, but mixed with much doubt and uncertainty: their legi&s;lators al&s;o endeavoured to infu&s;e into the minds of the people a belief of rewards and punin&s;hments after death; but by this they only intended to give a &s;anction to their laws, and to enforce the practice of virtue for the benefit of mankind in the pre&s;ent life; this alone &s;eems to have been their end, and a meritorious end it was; but Chri&s;tianity not only operates more effectually to this end, but has a nobler de&s;ign
<PB N="11" REF="016812_0010_0F9E7F155F90CB98">in view, which is by a proper education here to render us fit members of a cele&s;tial &s;ociety here|after. In all former religions the good of the pre&s;ent life was the fir&s;t object; in the Chri&s;tian it is but the &s;econd; in tho&s;e, men were incited to promote that good by the hopes of a future reward; in this the practice of virtue is injoined in order to qualify them for that reward. There is great difference, I apprehend, in the&s;e two plans, that is an adhering to Virtue from its pre|&s;ent utility in expectation of future happine&s;s; and this living in &s;uch a manner as to qualify us for the acceptance, and enjoyment of that happi|ne&s;s; and the conduct and di&s;po&s;itions of tho&s;e who act on the&s;e different principles, mu&s;t be no le&s;s different; on the fir&s;t the con&s;tant practice of ju&s;tice, temperance, and &s;obriety, will be &s;uffi|cient; but on the latter, we mu&s;t add to the&s;e an habitual piety, faith, re&s;ignation, and contempt of the world; the fir&s;t may make us very good citizens, but will never produce a tolerable chri&s;|tian. Hence it is that Chri&s;tianity in&s;i&s;ts more &s;trongly, than any preceding in&s;titution religious or moral, on purity of heart and a benevolent di&s;po&s;ition; becau&s;e the&s;e are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to its great end; but in tho&s;e who&s;e recommen|dations of virtue regard the pre&s;ent life only, and who&s;e promi&s;ed rewards in another were low and &s;en&s;ual, no preparatory qualifications were requi|&s;ite to enable men to practi&s;e the one, or to enjoy the other; and therefore we &s;ee this object is peculiar to this religion; and with it was intirely new.</P>
<P>But although this object, and the principle on which it is founded were new, and perhaps un|di&s;coverable
<PB N="12" REF="016812_0011_0F9E7F1787D41EB0">by rea&s;on, yet when di&s;covered, they are &s;o con&s;onant to it, that we cannot but readily a&s;&s;ent to them. For the truth of this principle, that the pre&s;ent life is a &s;tate of probation, and education to prepare us for another, is confirmed by every thing which we &s;ee around us: It is the only key which can open to us the de&s;igns of Pro|vidence in the oeconomy of human affairs, the only clue, which can guide us through that pathle&s;s wilderne&s;s, and the only plan on which this world could po&s;&s;ibly have been formed, or on which the hi&s;tory of it can be comprehended or explain|ed. It could never have been formed on a plan of happine&s;s, becau&s;e it is every were over&s;pread with innumerable mi&s;eries; nor of mi&s;ery, be|cau&s;e it is inter&s;per&s;ed with many enjoyments: It could not have been con&s;tituted for a &s;cene of wi&s;dom and virtue, becau&s;e the hi&s;tory of man|kind is little more than a detail of their follies, and wickedne&s;s: Nor of vice, becau&s;e that is no plan at all, being de&s;tructive of all exi&s;tence, and con&s;equently of its own: But on this &s;y&s;tem all that we here meet with, may be ea&s;ily account|ed for; for this mixture of happine&s;s and mi&s;ery, of virtue and vice, nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ults from a &s;tate of probation and education; as probation implies trials, &s;ufferings and a capacity of offending, and education a propriety of cha&s;ti&s;ement for tho&s;e offences.</P>
<P>In the next place the doctrines of this religion are equally new with the object, and contain ideas of God, and of man, of the pre&s;ent, and of a future life; and of the relations which all the&s;e bear to each other totally unheard of, and quite di&s;&s;imilar from any which had ever been
<PB N="13" REF="016812_0012_0F9E7F1867010410">thought on, previous to its publication. No other ever drew &s;o ju&s;t a portrait of the worth|le&s;&s;ne&s;s of this world, and all its pur&s;uits, nor exhibited &s;uch di&s;tinct, lively and exqui&s;ite pic|tures of the joys of another; of the re&s;urrection of the dead, the la&s;t judgment, and the triumphs of the righteous in that tremendous day, <Q>when this corruptible &s;hall put on incorruption, and this mortal &s;hall put on immortality.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xv. 53.</NOTE></Q> No other has ever repre&s;ented the &s;upreme Being in the character of three per&s;ons united in one God.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">That there &s;ub&s;i&s;ts &s;ome &s;uch union in the divine nature, the whole tenour of the New Te&s;tament &s;eems to expre&s;s, and it was &s;o under&s;tood in the earlie&s;t ages: But whether this union does, or does not imply equality, or whether it &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in general, or only in particular cir|cum&s;tances, we are not informed, and therefore on the&s;e que&s;tions it is not only unnece&s;&s;ary, but improper for us to decide.</NOTE> No other has attempted to reconcile tho&s;e &s;eeming contradictory but both true propo&s;itions, the contingency of future events, and the fore-knowledge of God, or the free-will of the crea|ture with the over-ruling grace of the Creator. No other has &s;o fully declared the nece&s;&s;ity of wickedne&s;s and puni&s;hment, yet &s;o effectually in&s;tructed individuals to re&s;i&s;t the one, and to e&s;cape the other; no other has ever pretended to give any account of the depravity of man, or to point out any remedy for it; no other has ven|tured to declare the unpardonable nature of &s;in without the influence of a mediatorial interpo&s;i|tion, and a vicarious atonement from the &s;uffer|ings
<PB N="14" REF="016812_0013_0F9E7F19675E9918">of a &s;uperior Being.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That Chri&s;t &s;uffered and died as an atonement for the &s;ins of mankind, is a doctrine &s;o con&s;tantly and &s;o &s;trongly enforced through every part of the New Te&s;tament, that whoever will &s;eriou&s;ly peru&s;e tho&s;e writings, and deny that it is there, may, with as much rea&s;on and truth, after reading the works of Thucydides and Livy, a&s;&s;ert, that in them no mention is made of any facts relative to the hi&s;to|ries of Greece and Rome.</NOTE> Whether the&s;e wonderful doctrines are worthy of our belief mu&s;t depend on the opinion, which we entertain of the authority of tho&s;e, who publi&s;hed them to the world; but certain it is, that they are all &s;o far removed from every tract of the human imagination, that it &s;eems equally impo&s;&s;ible, that they &s;hould ever have been derived from the knowledge, or the artifice of man.</P>
<P>Some indeed there are, who by perverting the e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;ignification of words, (which they call explaining) have ventured to expunge all the&s;e doctrines out of the &s;criptures, for no other rea&s;on than that they are not able to comprehend them; and argue thus:&mdash;The &s;criptures are the word of God; in his word no propo&s;itions con|tradictory to rea&s;on can have a place; the&s;e pro|po&s;itions are contradictory to rea&s;on and there|fore they are not there: But if the&s;e bold a&s;&s;ert|ors would claim any regard, they &s;hould rever&s;e their argument, and &s;ay,&mdash;The&s;e doctrines make a part, and a material part of the &s;criptures, they are contradictory to rea&s;on; no propo&s;itions con|tradictory to rea&s;on can be a part of the word of God, and therefore neither the &s;criptures, nor the pretended revelation contained in them, can be derived from him: This would be an argu|ment
<PB N="15" REF="016812_0014_0F9E7F19F2626C18">worthy of rational and candid Dei&s;ts, and demand a re&s;pectful attention; but when men pretend to di&s;prove facts by rea&s;oning, they have no right to expect an an&s;wer.</P>
<P>And here I cannot omit ob&s;erving, that the per&s;onal character of the author of this religion is no le&s;s new, and extraordinary, than the reli|gion it&s;elf, who "&s;pake as never man &s;pake,"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John vii. 46.</NOTE> and lived as never man lived: in proof of this, I do not mean to allege, that he was born of a virgin, that he fa&s;ted forty days, that he per|formed a variety of miracles, and after being buried three days, that he aro&s;e from the dead; becau&s;e the&s;e accounts will have but little effect on the minds of unbelievers, who, if they believe not the religion, will give no credit to the rela|tion of the&s;e facts; but I will prove it from facts, which cannot be di&s;puted; for in&s;tance, he is the only founder of a religion in the hi&s;tory of man|kind, which is totally unconnected with all hu|man policy and government; and therefore total|ly unconducive to any worldly purpo&s;e whatever: all others, Mahomet, Numa, and even Mo&s;es him&s;elf, blended their religious in&s;titutions with their civil, and by them obtained dominion over their re&s;pective people; but Chri&s;t neither aimed at, nor would accept of any &s;uch power; he rejected every object, which all other men pur|&s;ue, and made choice of all tho&s;e which others fly from, and are afraid of: he refu&s;ed power, riches, honours, and plea&s;ure, and courted po|verty, ignominy, tortures, and death. Many have been the enthu&s;ia&s;ts, and impo&s;tors, who have endeavoured to impo&s;e on the world pre|tended

<P>To &s;ay the truth, before the appearance of Chri&s;tianity there exi&s;ted nothing like religion on the face of the earth; the Jewi&s;h only except|ed: all other nations were immer&s;ed in the gro&s;|&s;e&s;t idolatry, which had little or no connection with morality, except to corrupt it by the infa|mous examples of their imaginary deities: they all wor&s;hipped a multiplicity of gods and dae|mons, who&s;e favour they courted by impious, ob&s;cene, and ridiculous ceremonies, and who&s;e anger they endeavoured to appea&s;e by the mo&s;t abominable cruelties. In the polite&s;t ages of the polite&s;t nations in the world, at a time when Greece and Rome had carried the arts of oratory, poetry, hi&s;tory, architecture and &s;culpture to the highe&s;t perfection, and made no incon&s;iderable advances in tho&s;e of mathematics, natural, and even moral philo&s;ophy, in religious knowledge they had made none at all; a &s;trong pre&s;ump|tion, that the noble&s;t efforts of the mind of man una&s;&s;i&s;ted by revelation were unequal to the ta&s;k. Some few indeed of their philo&s;ophers were wi&s;e enough to reject the&s;e general ab&s;urdities, and dared to attempt a loftier flight: Plato introduced many &s;ublime ideas of nature, and its fir&s;t cau&s;e, and of the immortality of the &s;oul, which being above his own and all human di&s;covery, he pro|bably acquired from the books of Mo&s;es or the conver&s;ation of &s;ome Jewi&s;h rabbies, which he might have met with in Egypt, where he re&s;ided, and &s;tudied for &s;everal years: from him Ari&s;totle, and from both Cicero and &s;ome few others drew
<PB N="20" REF="016812_0019_0F9E7F1F0EEC9E20">mo&s;t amazing &s;tores of philo&s;ophical &s;cience, and carried their re&s;earches into divine truths as far as human genius alone could penetrate. But the&s;e were bright con&s;tellations which appeared &s;ingly in &s;everal centuries, and even the&s;e with all this knowledge were very deficient in true theology. From the vi&s;ible works of the Crea|tion they traced the being and principal attributes of the Creator; but the relation which his being and attributes bear to man they little under&s;tood; of piety and devotion they had &s;carce any &s;en&s;e, nor could they form any mode of wor&s;hip worthy of the purity and perfection of the divine nature: they occa&s;ionally flung out many elegant encomi|ums on the native beauty, and excellence of vir|tue: but they founded it not on the commands of God, nor connected it with a holy life, nor hung out the happine&s;s of heaven as its reward, or its object. They &s;ometimes talked of virtue carrying men to heaven, and placing them a|mong&s;t the gods; but by this virtue they meant only the invention of arts, or feats of arms: for with them heaven was open only to legi&s;lators, and conquerors, the civilizers, or de&s;troyers of mankind. This was then the &s;ummit of religion in the mo&s;t poli&s;hed nations in the world, and even this was confined to a few philo&s;ophers, prodigies of genius and literature, who were little attended to, and le&s;s under&s;tood by the generality of mankind in their own countries; whil&s;t all the re&s;t were involved in one common cloud of ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition.</P>
<P>At this time Chri&s;tianity broke forth from the ea&s;t like a ri&s;ing &s;un, and di&s;pelled this univer&s;al darkne&s;s, which ob&s;cured every part of the globe,
<PB N="21" REF="016812_0020_0F9E7F1F1D6F4F10">and even at this day prevails in all tho&s;e remotes regions, to which its &s;alutary influence has not as yet extended. From all tho&s;e which it has reached, it has, notwith&s;tanding its corruptions, bani&s;hed all tho&s;e enormities, and introduced a more rational devotion, and purer morals: It has taught men the unity, and attributes of the &s;upreme Being, the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, the re&s;ur|rection of the dead, life everla&s;ting, and the kingdom of heaven; doctrines as inconceivable to the wi&s;e&s;t of mankind antecedent to its appear|ance, as the Newtonian &s;y&s;tem is at this day to the mo&s;t ignorant tribes of &s;avages in the wilds of America; doctrines which human rea&s;on never could have di&s;covered, but which when di&s;cover|ed, coincide with, and are confirmed by it; and which, though beyond the reach of all the learn|ing and pentration of Plato, Ari&s;totle, and Cicero, are now clearly laid open to the eye of every pea&s;ant and mechanic with the Bible in his hand. The&s;e are all plain facts too glaring to be contradicted, and therefore, whatever we may think of the authority of the&s;e books, the rela|tions which they contain, or the in&s;piration of their authors, of the&s;e facts on man, who has eyes to read, or ears to hear, can entertain a doubt; becau&s;e there are the books, and in them is this religion.</P>

<HEAD>PROPOSITION III.</HEAD>
<P>MY third propo&s;ition is this: that from this book called the New Te&s;tament, may be collected a &s;y&s;tem of ethics, in which every moral precept founded on rea&s;on is carried to a higher degree of purity and perfection, than in any other of the ancient philo&s;ophers of preced|ing ages; every moral precept founded on fal&s;e principles is intirely omitted, and many new pre|cepts added, peculiarly corre&s;ponding with the new object of this religion.</P>
<P>By moral precepts founded on rea&s;on, I mean all tho&s;e, which enforce the practice of &s;uch du|ties as rea&s;on informs us mu&s;t improve our na|tures, and conduce to the happine&s;s of mankind: &s;uch are piety to God, benevolence to men, ju&s;tice, charity, temperance, and &s;obriety, with all tho&s;e, which prohibit the commi&s;&s;ion of the contrary vices, all which deba&s;e our natures, and, by mutual injuries, introduce univer&s;al di&s;|order, and con&s;equently univer&s;al mi&s;ery. By precepts founded on fal&s;e principles, I mean tho&s;e which recommend fictitious virtues productive of none of the&s;e &s;alutary effects, and therefore, however celebrated and admired, are in fact no virtues at all; &s;uch are valour, patrioti&s;m, and friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>That virtues of the fir&s;t kind are carried to a higher degree of purity and perfection by the chri&s;tian religion than by any other, it is here unnece&s;&s;ary to prove, becau&s;e this is a truth, which has been &s;o frequently demon&s;trated by
<PB N="23" REF="016812_0022_0F9E7F20B246D1B0">her friends, and never once denied by the mo&s;t determined of her adver&s;aries; but it will be proper to &s;hew, that tho&s;e of the latter &s;ort are mo&s;t judiciou&s;ly omitted; becau&s;e they have real|ly no intrin&s;ic merit in them, and are totally incompatible with the genius and &s;pirit of this in&s;titution.</P>
<P>Valour, for in&s;tance, or active courage, is for the mo&s;t part con&s;titutional, and therefore can have no more claim to moral merit, than wit, beauty, health, &s;trength, or any other endow|ment of the mind or body; and &s;o far is it from producing any &s;alutary effects by introducing peace, order, or happine&s;s into &s;ociety, that it is the u&s;ual perpetrator of all the violences, which from retaliated injuries di&s;tract the world with blood&s;hed and deva&s;tation. It is the engine by which the &s;trong are enabled to plunder the weak, the proud to trample upon the humble, and the guilty to oppre&s;s the innnocent; it is the chief in&s;trument which Ambition employs in her unju&s;t pur&s;uits of wealth and power, and is therefore &s;o much extolled by her votaries: it was indeed congenial with the religion of pagans, who&s;e gods were for the mo&s;t part made out of decea&s;ed heroes, exalted to heaven as a reward for the mi&s;chiefs which they had perpetrated upon earth, and therefore with them this was the fir&s;t of virtues, and had even engro&s;&s;ed that denomination to it&s;elf; but whatever merit it may have a&s;&s;umed among pagans, with chri&s;tians it can pretend to none, and few or none are the occa&s;ions in which they are permitted to exert it: they are &s;o far from being allowed to inflict evil, that they are forbid even to re&s;i&s;t it; they
<PB N="24" REF="016812_0023_0F9E7F2178E21E58">are &s;o far from being encouraged to revenge injuries, that one of their fir&s;t duties is to for|give them; &s;o far from being incited to de&s;troy their enemies, that they are commanded to love them, and to &s;erve them to the utmo&s;t of their power. If chri&s;tian nations therefore were nati|ons of chri&s;tians, all war would be impo&s;&s;ible and unknown among&s;t them, and valour could be neither of u&s;e or e&s;timation, and therefore could never have a place in the catalogue of chri&s;tian virtues, being irreconcileable with all its precepts. I object not to the prai&s;e and ho|nours be&s;towed on the valiant, they are the lea&s;t tribute which can be paid them by tho&s;e who enjoy &s;afety and affluence by the intervention of their dangers and &s;ufferings; I a&s;&s;ert only that active courage can never be a chri&s;tian virtue, becau&s;e a chri&s;tian can have nothing to do with it. Pa&s;&s;ive courage is indeed frequently, and properly inculcated by this meek and &s;uffering religion, under the titles of patience and re&s;ig|nation: a real and &s;ub&s;tantial virtue this, and a direct contra&s;t to the former; for pa&s;&s;ive courage ari&s;es from the noble&s;t di&s;po&s;itions of the human mind, from a contempt of misfortunes, pain, and death, and a confidence in the protection of the Almighty; active from the meane&s;t: from pa&s;&s;ion, vanity, and &s;elf-dependence: pa&s;&s;ive courage is derived from a zeal for truth, and a per&s;everance in duty; active is the offspring of pride and revenge, and the parent of cruelty and inju&s;tice: in &s;hort pa&s;&s;ive courage is the re&s;olution of a philo&s;opher, active is the &s;erocity of a &s;avage. Nor is this more incompatible with the precepts, than with the object of this
<PB N="25" REF="016812_0024_0F9E7F221E45FC18">religion, which is the attainment of the king|dom of heaven; for valour is not that &s;ort of violence, by which that kingdom is to be taken; nor are the turbulent &s;pirits of heroes and con|querors admi&s;&s;ible into tho&s;e regions of peace, &s;ubordination, and tranquillity.</P>
<P>Patrioti&s;m al&s;o, that celebrated virtue &s;o much practi&s;ed in ancient, and &s;o much profe&s;&s;ed in modern times, that virtue, which &s;o long pre|&s;erved the liberties of Greece, and exalted Rome to the empire of the world: this celebrated vir|tue, I &s;ay, mu&s;t al&s;o be excluded; becau&s;e it not only falls &s;hort of, but directly counteracts, the exten&s;ive Benevolence of this religion. A chri&s;|tian is of no country, he is a citizen of the world; and his neighbours and country-men are the inhabitants of the remote&s;t regions, when|ever their di&s;tre&s;&s;es demand his friendly a&s;&s;i&s;tance: Chri&s;tianity commands us to love all mankind, Patrioti&s;m to oppre&s;s all other countries to ad|vance the imaginary pro&s;perity of our own: Chri&s;tianity enjoins us to imitate the univer&s;al benevolence of our Creator, who pours forth his ble&s;&s;ings on every nation upon earth; Patrioti&s;m to copy the mean partiality of an Engli&s;h pari&s;h officer, who thinks inju&s;tice and cruelty merito|rious, whenever they promote the intere&s;ts of his own incon&s;iderable village. This has ever been a favourite virtue with mankind, becau&s;e it conceals &s;elf-intere&s;t under the ma&s;k of public &s;pirit, not only from others, but even from them&s;elves, and gives a licence to inflict wrongs and injuries not only with impunity, but with applau&s;e; but it is &s;o diametrically oppo&s;ite to
<PB N="26" REF="016812_0025_0F9E7F22DAC40148">the great characteri&s;tic of this in&s;titution, that it never could have been admitted into the li&s;t of chri&s;tian virtues.</P>
<P>Friend&s;hip likewi&s;e, although more congenial to the principles of Chri&s;tianity ari&s;ing from more tender and amiable di&s;po&s;itions, could ne|ver gain admittance among&s;t her benevolent pre|cepts for the &s;ame rea&s;on; becau&s;e it is too nar|row and confined, and appropriates that benevo|lence to a &s;ingle object, which is here commanded to be extended over all: Where friend&s;hips ari&s;e from &s;imilarity of &s;entiments, and di&s;intere&s;ted affections, they are advantageous, agreeable, and innocent, but have little preten&s;ions to merit; for it is ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, <Q>If ye love them, which love you, what thanks have ye? for &s;inners al&s;o love tho&s;e, that love them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke vi. 32.</NOTE></Q> But if they are formed from alliances in parties, facti|ons, and intere&s;ts, or from a participation of vices, the u&s;ual parents of what are called friend|&s;hips among mankind, they are then both mi&s;|chievous and criminal, and con&s;equently forbid|den, but in their utmo&s;t purity de&s;erve no re|commendation from this religion.</P>
<P>To the judicious omi&s;&s;ion of the&s;e fal&s;e virtues we may add that remarkable &s;ilence, which the Chri&s;tian Legi&s;lator every were pre&s;erves on &s;ub|jects e&s;teemed by all others of the highe&s;t im|portance, civil government, national policy, and the rights of war and peace; of the&s;e he has not taken the lea&s;t notice, probably for this plain rea&s;on, becau&s;e it would have been impo&s;&s;ible to have formed any explicit regulations concerning them, which mu&s;t not have been incon&s;i&s;tent

<P>Let us now examine what are tho&s;e new pre|cepts in this religion peculiarly corre&s;ponding with the new object of it, that is preparing us for the kingdom of heaven: Of the&s;e the chief are poorne&s;s of &s;pirit, forgivene&s;s of injuries, and charity to all men; to the&s;e we may add repentance, faith, &s;elf-aba&s;ement, and a detach|ment from the world, all moral duties peculiar to this religion, and ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the attainment of its end.</P>
<P><Q>Ble&s;&s;ed are the poor in &s;pirit; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. v. 3.</NOTE></Q> By which poor|ne&s;s of &s;pirit is to be under&s;tood a di&s;po&s;ition of mind, meek, humble, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to power, void of ambition, patient of injuries, and free from all re&s;entment: This was &s;o new, and &s;o oppo&s;ite to the ideas of all Pagan morali&s;ts, that they thought this temper of mind a criminal and con|temptible meanne&s;s, which mu&s;t induce men to &s;acrifice the glory of their country, and their own honour, to a &s;hameful pu&s;illanimity; and
<PB N="28" REF="016812_0027_0F9E7F25DB318858">&s;uch it appears to almo&s;t all who are called Chri&s;|tians even at this day, who not only reject it in practice, but di&s;avow it in principle, notwith|&s;tanding this explicit declaration of their Ma&s;ter. We &s;ee them revenging the &s;malle&s;t affronts by premeditated murder; as individuals, on princi|ples of honour; and, in their national capacities, de&s;troying each other with fire and &s;word, for the low con&s;iderations of commercial intere&s;ts, the balance of rival powers, or the amibition of princes: We &s;ee them with their la&s;t breath ani|mating each other to a &s;avage revenge, and, in the agonies of death, plunging with feeble arms their daggers into the hearts of their opponents: and, what is &s;till wor&s;e, we hear all the&s;e barbar|i&s;ms celebrated by hi&s;torians, flattered by poets, applauded in theatres, approved in &s;enates, and even &s;anctified in pulpits. But univer&s;al practice cannot alter the nature of things, nor univer&s;al error change the nature of truth: Pride was not made for man, but humility, meekne&s;s, and re|&s;ignation, that is poorne&s;s of &s;pirit, was made for man, and properly belongs to his dependant and precarious &s;ituation; and is the only di&s;po&s;i|tion of mind, which can enable him to enjoy ea&s;e and quiet here, and happine&s;s hereafter: Yet was this important precept intirely unknown until it was promulgated by him, who &s;aid, <Q>Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of &s;uch is the kingdom of heaven: Verily I &s;ay unto you, whoever &s;hall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he &s;hall not enter therein.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. x 14.</NOTE></Q></P>

But how much more magnanimous, how much more beneficial to mankind, is forgivene&s;s! it is more magnanimous, becau&s;e every generous and ex|alted di&s;po&s;ition of the human mind is requi&s;ite to the practice of it: for the&s;e alone can enable us to bear the wrongs and in&s;ults of wickedne&s;s and folly with patience, and to look down on the perpetrators of them with pity, rather than indignation; the&s;e alone can teach us, that &s;uch are but a part of tho&s;e &s;ufferings allotted to us in this &s;tate of probation, and to know, that to overcome evil with good, is the mo&s;t glorious of all victories: it is the mo&s;t beneficial, becau&s;e this amiable conduct alone can put an end to an eternal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of injuries and retaliations; for every retaliation becomes a new injury, and re|quires another act of revenge for &s;atisfaction.

<P>A third precept, fir&s;t noticed and fir&s;t injoined by this in&s;titution, is charity to all men. What this is, we may be&s;t learn from this admirable de|&s;cription, painted in the following words: <Q>Cha|rity &s;uffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not it&s;elf; is not puffed up; doth not behave it&s;elf un&s;eemly; &s;eeketh not her own; is not ea&s;ily provoked; thinketh no evil; rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in truth; feareth all things; believeth all things; hopeth all things; endureth all things.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xiii. 4.</NOTE></Q> Here we have an accurate delineation of this bright con&s;tellation of all virtues, which con&s;i&s;ts not, as many imagine, in the building of mona&s;|teries, endowment of ho&s;pitals, or the di&s;tribution of alms, but in &s;uch an amiable di&s;po&s;ition of mind, as exerci&s;es it&s;elf every hour in acts of kindne&s;s, patience, complacency, and benevolence to all around us, and which alone is able to promote happine&s;s in the pre&s;ent life, or render us capa|ble
<PB N="31" REF="016812_0030_0F9E7F28476B5A60">of receiving it in another: and yet this is totally new, and &s;o it is declared to be by the author of it: <Q>A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another;&mdash;as I have loved you, that ye love one another; by this &s;hall all men know, that ye are my di&s;ciples, if ye have love one to another.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">John xiii. 34.</NOTE></Q> This bene|volent di&s;po&s;ition is made the great characteri&s;tic of a chri&s;tian, the te&s;t of his obedience, and the mark by which he is to be di&s;tingui&s;hed. This love for each other is that charity ju&s;t now de|cribed, and contains all tho&s;e qualities, which are there attributed to it; humility, patience, meekne&s;s, and beneficence: without which we mu&s;t live in perpetual di&s;cord, and con&s;equently cannot pay obedience to this commandment by loving one another; a commandment &s;o &s;ublime, &s;o rational, and &s;o beneficial, &s;o wi&s;ely calculated to correct the depravity, dimini&s;h the wickedne&s;s, and abate the mi&s;eries of human nature, that, did we univer&s;ally comply with it, we &s;hould &s;oon be relieved from all the inquietudes ari&s;ing from our own unruly pa&s;&s;ions, anger, envy, revenge, malice, and ambition, as well as from all tho&s;e injuries, to which we are perpetually expo&s;ed from the indulgence of the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions in others. It would al&s;o pre&s;erve our minds in &s;uch a &s;tate of tranquillity, and &s;o prepare them for the kingdom of heaven, that we &s;hould &s;lide out of a life of peace, love and benevolence, into that cele&s;tial &s;ociety, by an almo&s;t imperceptible tran&s;ition. Yet was this commandment intirely new, when given by him, who &s;o intitles it, and has made it the capital duty of his religion, be|cau&s;e
<PB N="32" REF="016812_0031_0F9E7F2920BEA120">the mo&s;t indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to the attainment of its great object, the kingdom of heaven; into which if proud, turbulent and vin|dictive &s;pirits were permitted to enter, they mu&s;t unavoidably de&s;troy the happine&s;s of that &s;tate by the operations of the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions and vices, by which they di&s;turb the pre&s;ent, and therefore all &s;uch mu&s;t be eternally excluded, not only as a puni&s;hment, but al&s;o from incapacity.</P>
<P>Repentance, by this we plainly &s;ee, is another new moral duty &s;trenuou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted on by this religion, and by no other. becau&s;e ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the accompli&s;hment of its end; for this alone can purge us from tho&s;e tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, from which we cannot be totally exempted in this &s;tate of trial and temptation, and purify us from that depravity in our nature, which renders us incapable of attaining this end. Hence al&s;o we may learn, that no repentance can remove this incapacity, but &s;uch as intirely changes the nature and di&s;po&s;ition of the offender; which in the language of Scripture is called <Q>being born again.</Q> Mere contrition for pa&s;t crimes, nor even the pardon of them, cannot effect this, un|le&s;s it operates to this intire conver&s;ion or new birth, as it is properly and emphatically named: for &s;orrow can no more purify a mind corrupted by a long continuance in vicious habits, than it can re&s;tore health to a body di&s;tempered by a long cour&s;e of vice and intemperance. Hence al&s;o every one, who is in the lea&s;t acquainted with him&s;elf, may judge of the rea&s;onablene&s;s of the hope that is in him, and of his &s;ituation in a future &s;tate by that of his pre&s;ent. If he feels in him&s;elf a temper proud, turbulent, vin|dictive,

<P>Faith is another moral duty injoined by this in&s;titution, of a &s;pecies &s;o new, that the philo&s;o|phers of antiquity had no word expre&s;&s;ive of this idea, nor any &s;uch idea to be expre&s;&s;ed; for the word <HI>pi&s;tis</HI> or <HI>&s;ides,</HI> which we tran&s;late faith, was never u&s;ed by any pagan writer in a &s;en&s;e the lea&s;t &s;imilar to that, to which it is applied in the New Te&s;tament: where in general it &s;ignifies an humble, teachable, and candid di&s;po&s;ition, a tru&s;t in God, and confidence in his promi&s;es: when applied particularly to chri&s;ianity, it means no more than a belief of this &s;ingle propo&s;ition, that Chri&s;t was the Son of God; that is, in the language of tho&s;e writings, the Me&s;&s;iah, who was foretold by the prophets, and expected by the Jews; who was &s;ent by God into the world to preach righteou&s;ne&s;s, judgment, and everla&s;t|ing life, and to die as an atonement for the &s;ins of mankind. This was all that Chri&s;t required to be believed by tho&s;e who were willing to become his di&s;ciples: he, who does not believe this, is not a Chri&s;tian, and he who does, be|lieves the whole that is e&s;&s;ential to his profe&s;&s;ion, and all that is properly comprehended under the name of &s;aith. This unfortunate word has in|deed
<PB N="34" REF="016812_0033_0F9E7F2BD02BF808">been &s;o tortured and &s;o mi&s;applied to mean every ab&s;urdity, which artifice could impo&s;e upon ignorance, that it has lo&s;t all preten&s;ions to the title of virtue; but if brought back to the &s;im|plicity of its original &s;ignification, it well de&s;erves that name becau&s;e it u&s;ually ari&s;es from the mo&s;t amiable di&s;po&s;itions, and is always a direct con|tra&s;t to pride, ob&s;tinacy, and &s;elf-conceit. If taken in the exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e of an a&s;&s;ent to the evidence of things not &s;een, it comprehends the exi&s;tence of a God, and a future &s;tate, and is therefore not only it&s;elf a moral virtue, but the &s;ource from whence all others mu&s;t proceed; for on the belief of the&s;e all religion and morality mu&s;t intirely depend. It cannot be altogether void of moral merit, (as &s;ome would repre&s;ent it) becau&s;e it is in a degree voluntary; for daily experience &s;hews us, that men not only pretend to, but actually do believe, and di&s;belive almo&s;t any propo&s;itions, which be&s;t &s;uit their intere&s;ts, or inclinations, and unfeignedly change their &s;incere opinions with their &s;ituations and circum|&s;tances. For we have power over the mind's eye, as well as over the body's, to &s;hut it again&s;t the &s;tronge&s;t rays of truth and religion, when|ever they become painful to us, and to open it again to the faint glimmerings of &s;ceptici&s;m and infidelity when we <Q>love darkne&s;s rather than light, becau&s;e our deeds are evil.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John iii. 19.</NOTE></Q> And this, I think, &s;ufficiently refutes all objections to the moral nature of faith, drawn from the &s;up|po&s;ition of its being quite involuntary, and ne|ce&s;&s;arily dependent on the degree of evidence, which is offered to our under&s;tandings.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="016812_0034_0F9E7F2BDBF2F010">
Self-aba&s;ement is another moral duty incul|cated by this religion only; which requires us to impute even our own virtues to the grace and favour of our Creator, and to acknowledge, that we can do nothing good by our own powers, unle&s;s a&s;&s;i&s;ted by his over-ruling influence: This doc|trine &s;eems at fir&s;t &s;ight to infringe on our free|will, and to deprive us of all merit; but, on a clo&s;er examination, the truth of it may be de|mon&s;trated both by rea&s;on and experience, and that in fact it does not impair the one, or depre|ciate the other: and that it is productive of &s;o much humility, re&s;ignation, and dependance on God, that it ju&s;tly claims a place among&s;t the mo&s;t illu&s;trious moral virtues. Yet was this duty utterly repugnant to the proud and &s;elf-&s;ufficient principles of the ancient philo&s;ophers as well as modern Dei&s;ts, and therefore before the publica|tion of the go&s;pel totally unknown and uncom|prehended.</P>
<P>Detachment from the world is another moral virtue con&s;tituted by this religion alone: &s;o new, that even at this day few of its profe&s;&s;ors can be per&s;uaded, that it is required, or that it is any virtue at all. By this detachment from the world is not to be under&s;tood a &s;eclu&s;ion from &s;ociety, ab&s;traction from all bu&s;ine&s;s, or retirement to a gloomy cloy&s;ter. Indu&s;try and labour, chearful|ne&s;s and ho&s;pitality are frequently recommended: nor is the acqui&s;ition of wealth and honours pro|hibited, if they can be obtained by hone&s;t means, and a moderate degree of attention and care: but &s;uch an unremitted anxiety, and perpetual application as engro&s;&s;es our whole time and thoughts, are forbid, becau&s;e they are incompa|tible
<PB N="36" REF="016812_0035_0F9E7F2D073AB540">with the &s;pirit of this religion, and mu&s;t utterly di&s;qualify us for the attainment of its great end. We toil on in the vain pur&s;uits and frivolous occupations of the world, die in our harne&s;s, and the expect, if no gigantic crime &s;tands in the way, to &s;tep immediately into the kingdom of heaven: but this is impo&s;&s;ible; for without a previous detachment from the bu&s;ine&s;s of this world, we cannot be prepared for the happine&s;s of another. Yet this could make no part of the morality of pagans, becau&s;e their virtues were altogether connected with this bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and con&s;i&s;ted chiefly in conducting it with honour to them&s;elves, and benefit to the public: But Chri&s;tianity has a nobler object in view, which, if not attended to, mu&s;t be lo&s;t for ever. This object is that cele&s;tial man&s;ion of which we &s;hould never lo&s;e &s;ight, and to which we &s;hould be ever advancing during our journey thro' life: but this by no means precludes us from perform|ing the bu&s;ine&s;s, or enjoying the amu&s;ements of travellers, provided they detain us not too long, or lead us too far out of our way.</P>
<P>It cannot be denied, that the great author of the chri&s;tian in&s;titution, fir&s;t and &s;ingly ventured to oppo&s;e all-the chief principles of paean virtue, and to introduce a religion directly oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e erroneous though long-e&s;tabli&s;hed opinions, both in its duties and in its object. The mo&s;t celebrated virtues of the ancients were high &s;pirit, intrepid courage, and implacable re&s;ent|ment.</P>
<P><HI>Impiger, iracundus, inexorabilis, acer,</HI> was the portrait of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious Hero, drawn by one of the fir&s;t poets of antiquity: To

But what &s;ays the Chri&s;tian Legi&s;lator to his di&s;ciples on this &s;ubject? <Q>Ble&s;&s;ed are ye, when men &s;hall revile you, and &s;hall &s;ay all manner of evil again&s;t you for my &s;ake; re|joice, and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in heaven.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matt. v. 11.</NOTE></Q> So widely different is the genius of the Pagan and Chri&s;tian morality, that I will venture to affirm, that the mo&s;t cele|brated virtues of the former are more oppo&s;ite to the &s;pirit, and more incon&s;i&s;tent with the end of
<PB N="38" REF="016812_0037_0F9E7F2E19DD3B28">the latter, than even their mo&s;t infamous vices; and that a Brutus wrenching vengeance out of his hands to whom alone it belongs, by murder|ing the oppre&s;&s;or of his country, or a Cato mur|dering him&s;elf from an impatience of controul, leaves the world more unqualified for, and more inadmi&s;&s;ible into the kingdom of heaven, than even a Me&s;&s;alina, or an Heliogabalus, with all their profligacy about them.</P>
<P>Nothing, I believe, has &s;o much contributed to corrupt the true &s;pirit of the Chri&s;tian in&s;titu|tion, as that partiality, which we contract from our earlie&s;t education for the manners of Pagan antiquity: from whence we learn to adopt every moral idea, which is repugnant to it; to applaud fal&s;e virtues, which that di&s;avows; to be guided by laws of honour, which that abhors; to imitate characters, which that dete&s;ts; and to behold heroes, patriots, conquerors, and &s;uicides with admiration, who&s;e conduct that utterly condemns. From a coalition of the&s;e oppo&s;ite principles was generated that mon&s;trous &s;y&s;tem of cruelty and benevolence, of barbari&s;m and civility, of rapine and ju&s;tice, of fighting and devotion, of revenge and genero&s;ity, which hara&s;&s;ed the world for &s;e|veral centuries with cru&s;ades, holy wars, knight-errantry, and &s;ingle combats, and even &s;till re|tains influence enough, under the name of ho|nour, to defeat the mo&s;t beneficent ends of this holy in&s;titution. I mean not by this to pa&s;s any cen&s;ure on the principles of valour, patrioti&s;m, or honour: they may be u&s;eful, and perhaps ne|ce&s;&s;ary, in the commerce and bu&s;ine&s;s of the pre|&s;ent turbulent and imperfect &s;tate; and tho&s;e who are actuated by them may be virtuous, ho|ne&s;t,
<PB N="39" REF="016812_0038_0F9E7F2ED9E0F060">and even religious men: all that I a&s;&s;ert is, that they cannot be Chri&s;tians: A profligate may be a Chri&s;tian, though a bad one, becau&s;e he may be overpowered by pa&s;&s;ions and temptations, and his actions may contradict his principles; but a man, who&s;e ruling principle is honour, how|ever virtuous he may be, cannot be a Chri&s;tian, becau&s;e he erects a &s;tandard of duty, and deli|berately adheres to it, diametrically oppo&s;ite to the whole tenour of that religion.</P>
<P>The contra&s;t between the Chri&s;tian, and all other in&s;titutions religious or moral previous to its appearance, is &s;ufficiently evident, and &s;urely the &s;uperiority of the former is as little to be di&s;|puted; unle&s;s any one &s;hall undertake to prove, that humility, patience, forgivene&s;s, and bene|volence are le&s;s amiable, and le&s;s beneficial qua|lities, than pride, turbulence, revenge, and ma|lignity: that the contempt of riches is le&s;s noble, than the acqui&s;ition by fraud and villainy, or the di&s;tribution of them to the poor, le&s;s commend|able than avarice or profu&s;ion; or that a real im|mortality in the kingdom of heaven is an object le&s;s exalted, le&s;s rational, and le&s;s worthy of pur&s;uit, than an imaginary immortality in the applau&s;e of men: that worthle&s;s tribute, which the folly of one part of mankind pays to the wickedne&s;s of the other; a tribute, which a wi&s;e man ought always to de&s;pi&s;e, becau&s;e a good man can &s;carce ever obtain.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>IF I mi&s;take not, I have now fully e&s;tabli&s;hed the truth of my three propo&s;itions.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That there is now extant a book intitled the New Te&s;tament.</P>
<P>Secondly, That from this book may be ex|tracted a &s;y&s;tem of religion intirely new; both in its object, and its doctrines, not only &s;uperior to, but totally unlike every thing, which had ever before entered into the mind of man.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That from this book may likewi&s;e be collected a &s;y&s;tem of ethics, in which every mo|ral precept founded on rea&s;on is carried to a higher degree of purity and perfection, than in any other of the wi&s;e&s;t philo&s;ophers of preced|ing ages; every moral precept founded on fal&s;e principles totally omitted, and many new pre|cepts added, peculiarly corre&s;ponding with the new object of this religion.</P>
<P>Every one of the&s;e propo&s;itions, I am per|&s;uaded, is incontrovertibly true; and if true, this &s;hort, but certain conclu&s;ion mu&s;t inevitably follow: That &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of religion and mo|rality could not po&s;&s;ibly have been the work of any man, or &s;et of men, much le&s;s of tho&s;e ob|&s;cure, ignorant, and illiterate per&s;ons who actu|ally did di&s;cover, and publi&s;h it to the world; and that therefore it mu&s;t have been effected by the &s;upernatural interpo&s;ition of divine power and wi&s;dom; that is, that it mu&s;t derive its ori|gin from God.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="016812_0040_0F9E7F31F870C2D0">
This argument &s;eems to me little &s;hort of de|mon&s;tration, and is indeed founded on the very &s;ame rea&s;oning, by which the material world is proved to be the work of his invi&s;ible hand. We view with admiration the heavens and the earth, and all therein contained; we contemplate with amazement the minute bodies of animals too &s;mall for perception, and the immen&s;e plane|tary orbs too va&s;t for imagination: We are certain that the&s;e cannot be the works of man; and therefore we conclude with rea&s;on, that they mu&s;t be the productions of an omnipotent Crea|tor. In the &s;ame manner we &s;ee here a &s;cheme of religion and morality unlike and &s;uperior to all ideas of the human mind, equally impo&s;&s;ible to have been di&s;covered by the knowledge, as invented by the artifice of man; and therefore by the very &s;ame mode of rea&s;oning, and with the &s;ame ju&s;tice, we conclude, that it mu&s;t de|rive its origin from the &s;ame omnipotent and omni&s;cient Being.</P>
<P>Nor was the propagation of this religion le&s;s extraordinary than the religion it&s;elf, or le&s;s above the reach of all human power, than the di&s;covery of it was above that of all human under&s;tanding. It is well known, that in the cour&s;e of a very few years it was &s;pread over all the principal parts of A&s;ia and of Europe, and this by the mini&s;try only of an incon&s;iderable number of the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable per&s;ons; that at this time Pagani&s;m was in the highe&s;t repute, believed univer&s;ally by the vulgar, and patro|ni&s;ed by the great; that the wi&s;e&s;t men of the wi&s;e&s;t nations a&s;&s;i&s;ted at its &s;acrifices, and con|&s;ulted its oracles on the mo&s;t important occa&s;i|ons:
<PB N="42" REF="016812_0041_0F9E7F3308910610">Whether the&s;e were the tricks of the prie&s;ts or of the devil, is of no con&s;equence, as they were both equally unlikely to be converted, or overcome; the fact is certain, that on the preach|ing of a few fi&s;hermen, their altars were de&s;ert|ed, and their deities were dumb. This miracle they undoubtedly performed, whatever we may think of the re&s;t: and this is &s;urely &s;ufficient to prove the authority of their commi&s;&s;ion; and to convince us, that neither their undertaking nor the execution of it could po&s;&s;ibly be their own.</P>

<P>But &s;hould the&s;e credulous infidels after all be in the right, and this pretended revelation be all a fable; from believing it what harm could en&s;ue? Would it render princes more tyrannical,
<PB N="44" REF="016812_0043_0F9E7F3423181D98">or &s;ubjects more ungovernable? the rich more in&s;olent, or the poor more di&s;orderly? Would it make wor&s;e parents or children, hu&s;bands or wives, ma&s;ters or &s;ervants, friends or neigh|bours? Or would it not make men more virtu|ous, and con&s;equently more happy in every &s;ituation? It could not be criminal; it could not be detrimental. It could not be criminal, be|cau&s;e it cannot be a crime to a&s;&s;ent to &s;uch evi|dence, as has been able to convince the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t of mankind; by which, if fal&s;e, Provi|dence mu&s;t have permitted men to deceive each other, for the mo&s;t beneficial ends, and which therefore it would be &s;urely more meritorious to believe, from a di&s;po&s;ition of faith and cha|rity, which believeth all things, than to reject with &s;corn from ob&s;tinacy and &s;elf-conceit: It cannot be detrimental, becau&s;e if chri&s;tianity is a fable, it is a fable, the belief of which is the only principle which can retain men in a &s;teady and uniform cour&s;e of virtue, piety, and devo|tion, or can &s;upport them in the hour of di&s;tre&s;s, of &s;ickne&s;s, and of death. Whatever might be the operations of true dei&s;m on the minds of pagan philo&s;ophers, that can now avail us nothing: for that light which once lightened the gentiles, is now ab&s;orbed in the brighter illumi|nation of the go&s;pel; we can now form no rati|onal &s;y&s;tem of dei&s;m, but what mu&s;t be borrow|ed from that &s;ource, and, as far as it reaches towards perfection, mu&s;t be exactly the &s;ame; and therefore if we will not accept of Chri&s;tia|nity, we can have no religion at all.

<P>If I have here demon&s;trated the divine origin of the chri&s;tian religion by an argument which cannot be confuted; no others, however plau|&s;ible or numerous, founded on probabilities, doubts, and conjectures, can ever di&s;prove it, becau&s;e if it is once &s;hewn to be true, it cannot be fal&s;e. But as many arguments of this kind have bewildered &s;ome candid and ingenuous minds, I &s;hall here be&s;tow a few lines on tho&s;e which have the mo&s;t weight, in order to wipe out, or at lea&s;t to dimini&s;h their perplexing in|fluence.</P>
<P>But here I mu&s;t previou&s;ly ob&s;erve, that the mo&s;t un&s;urmountable, as well as the mo&s;t u&s;ual ob&s;tacle to our belief, ari&s;es from our pa&s;&s;ions, appetites, and intere&s;ts; for faith being an act of the will as much as of the under&s;tanding, we oftener di&s;believe for want of inclination, than want of evidence. The fir&s;t &s;tep towards think|ing this revelation true, is our hopes that it is &s;o; for whenever we much wi&s;h any propo&s;ition to be true, we are not far from believing it. It is certainly for the intere&s;t of all good men, that its authority &s;hould be well founded; and &s;till more beneficial to the bad, if ever they intend to be better: becau&s;e it is the only &s;y&s;tem either of rea&s;on or religion which can give them any a&s;&s;urance of pardon. The puni&s;hment of vice is a debt due to ju&s;tice, which cannot be remit|ted without compen&s;ation: repentance can be no compen&s;ation; it may change a wicked man's di&s;po&s;itions, and prevent his offending for the
<PB N="46" REF="016812_0045_0F9E7F35A6D8EE58">future, but can lay no claim to pardon for what is pa&s;t. If any one by profligacy and extrava|gance contracts a debt, repentance may make him wi&s;er, and hinder him from running into further di&s;tre&s;&s;es, but can never pay off his old bonds; for which he mu&s;t be ever accountable, unle&s;s they are di&s;charged by him&s;elf, or &s;ome other in his &s;tead: this very di&s;charge Chri&s;tianity alone holds forth on our repentance, and, if true, will certainly perform: the truth of it therefore mu&s;t ardently be wi&s;hed for by all, except the wicked, who are determined neither to repent or reform. It is well worth every man's while, who either is, or intends to be vir|tuous, to believe Chri&s;tianity, if he can; becau&s;e he will find it the &s;ure&s;t pre&s;ervative again&s;t all vitious habits and their attendant evils, the be&s;t re&s;ource under di&s;tre&s;&s;es and di&s;appointments, ill health and ill fortune, and the firme&s;t ba&s;is on which contemplation can re&s;t; and without &s;ome, the human mind is never perfectly at ea&s;e. But if any one is attached to a favourite plea&s;ure, or eagerly engaged in worldly pur&s;uits incompatible with the precepts of this religion, and he believes it, he mu&s;t either relinqui&s;h tho&s;e pur&s;uits with unea&s;ine&s;s, or per&s;i&s;t in them with remor&s;e and di&s;&s;atisfaction, and therefore mu&s;t commence un|believer in his own defence. With &s;uch I &s;hall not di&s;pute, nor pretend to per&s;uade men by arguments to make them&s;elves mi&s;erable: but to tho&s;e, who, not afraid that this religion may be true, are really affected by &s;uch objections, I will offer the following an&s;wers, which, though &s;hort, will, I doubt not, be &s;ufficient to &s;hew them their weakne&s;s and futility.</P>

In the fir&s;t place then, &s;ome have been &s;o bold as to &s;trike at the root of all revelation from God, by a&s;&s;erting, that it is incredible, becau&s;e unnece&s;&s;ary, and unnece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e the rea&s;on which he has be&s;towed on mankind is &s;ufficiently able to di&s;cover all the religious and moral duties which he requires of them, if they would but attend to her precepts and be guided by her friendly admonitions. Mankind have undoubtedly at various times from the re|mote&s;t ages received &s;o much knowledge by di|vine communications, and have ever been &s;o much inclined to impute it all to their own &s;uf|ficiency, that it is now difficult to determine what human rea&s;on una&s;&s;i&s;ted can effect: But to form a true judgment on this &s;ubject, let us turn our eyes to tho&s;e remote regions of the globe, to which this &s;upernatural a&s;&s;i&s;tance has never yet extended, and we &s;hall there &s;ee men endued with &s;en&s;e and rea&s;on not inferior to our own, &s;o far from being capable of forming &s;y&s;|tems of religion and morality, that they are at this day totally unable to make a nail or a hatch|et: from whence we may &s;urely be convinced, that rea&s;on alone is &s;o far from being &s;ufficient to offer to mankind a perfect religion, that it has never yet been able to lead them to any degree of culture, or civilization whatever. The&s;e have uniformly flowed from that great fountain of divine communication opened in the ea&s;t, in the earlie&s;t ages, and thence been gradually diffu&s;ed in &s;alubrious &s;treams, throughout the various re|gions of the earth. Their ri&s;e and progre&s;s, by &s;urveying the hi&s;tory of the world, may ea&s;ily be traced backwards to their &s;ource; and wher|ever
<PB N="48" REF="016812_0047_0F9E7F371A6504E0">the&s;e have not as yet been able to penetrate, we there find the human &s;pecies not only void of all true religious and moral &s;entiments, but not the lea&s;t emerged from their original igno|rance and barbarity; which &s;eems a demon&s;trati|on, that although human rea&s;on is capable of progre&s;&s;ion in &s;cience, yet the fir&s;t foundations mu&s;t be laid by &s;upernatural in&s;tructions: for &s;urely no other probable cau&s;e can be a&s;&s;igned, why one part of mankind &s;hould have made &s;uch an amazing progre&s;s in religious, moral, meta|phy&s;ical, and philo&s;ophical enquiries; &s;uch won|derful improvements in policy, legi&s;lation, com|merce, and manufactures, while the other part, formed with the &s;ame natural capacities, and divided only by &s;eas and mountains, &s;hould re|main, during the &s;ame number of ages, in a &s;tate little &s;uperior to brutes, without govern|ment, without laws or letters, and even without cloaths and habitations; murdering each other to &s;atiate their revenge, and devouring each other to appea&s;e their hunger: I &s;ay no cau&s;e can be a&s;&s;igned for this amazing difference, ex|cept that the fir&s;t have received information from tho&s;e divine communications recorded in the &s;criptures, and the latter have never yet been favoured with &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance. This remarkable contra&s;t &s;eems an unan&s;werable, though perhaps a new proof of the nece&s;&s;ity of revelation, and a &s;olid refutation of all arguments again&s;t it, drawn from the &s;ufficiency of human rea&s;on. And as rea&s;on in her natural &s;tate is thus incapa|ble of making any progre&s;s in knowledge; &s;o when furni&s;hed with materials by &s;upernatural aid, if left to the guidance of her own wild

There is then no ab&s;urdity &s;o extravagant, which &s;he is not ready to adopt: &s;he has per&s;uaded &s;ome, that there is no God; others, that there can be no future &s;tate; &s;he has taught &s;ome, that there is no difference between vice and virtue, and that to cut a man's throat and to relieve his nece&s;&s;ities are actions equally meritorious: &s;he has con|vinced many, that they have no free-will in oppo|&s;ition to their own experience; &s;ome, that there can be no &s;uch thing as &s;oul, or &s;pirit, contrary to their own perceptions; and others no &s;uch thing as matter or body, in contradiction to their &s;en&s;es. By analy&s;ing all things &s;he can &s;hew, that there is nothing in any thing; by perpetual &s;i&s;ting &s;he can reduce all exi&s;tence to the invi&s;ible du&s;t of &s;ceptici&s;m; and by recurring to fir&s;t prin|ciples, prove to the &s;atisfaction of her followers, that there are no principles at all. How far &s;uch a guide is to be depended on in the important concerns of religion, and morals, I leave to the judgment of every con&s;iderate man to determine. This is certain, that human rea&s;on in its highe&s;t &s;tate of cultivation among&s;t the philo&s;ophers of Greece and Rome, was never able to form a religion comparable to Chri&s;tianity; nor have all tho&s;e &s;ources of moral virtue, &s;uch as truth, beauty, and the fitne&s;s of things, which modern philo&s;ophers have endeavoured to &s;ub&s;titute in its &s;tead, ever been effectual to produce good men, and have them&s;elves often been the productions of &s;ome of the wor&s;t.</P>

Others there are, who allow, that a revelation from God may be both nece&s;&s;ary, and credible; but allege, that the &s;criptures, that is the books of the Old and New Te&s;tament, cannot be that Revelation; becau&s;e in them are to be found errors and incon&s;i&s;tences, fabulous &s;tories, fal&s;e facts, and fal&s;e philo&s;ophy; which can never be derived from the fountain of all wi&s;dom and truth. To this I reply, that I readily acknow|ledge, that the &s;criptures are not revelations from God, but the hi&s;tory of them: The revelation it&s;elf is derived from God; but the hi&s;tory of it is the production of men, and therefore the truth of it is not in the lea&s;t affected by their fallibility, but depends on the internal evidence of its own &s;upernatural excellence. If in the&s;e books &s;uch a religion, as has been here de&s;cribed, actually exi&s;ts, no &s;eeming, or even real defects to be found in them can di&s;prove the divine origin of this religion, or invalidate my argument. Let us, for in&s;tance, grant that the Mo&s;aic hi&s;tory of the creation was founded on the erroneous but popular principles of tho&s;e early ages, who ima|gined the earth to be a va&s;t plain, and the cele&s;|tial bodies no more than luminaries hung up in the concave firmament to enlighten it; will it from thence follow, that Mo&s;es could not be a proper in&s;trument in the hands of Providence, to impart to the Jews a divine law, becau&s;e he was not in&s;pired with a fore-knowledge of the Coper|nican and Newtonian &s;y&s;tems? or that Chri&s;t mu&s;t be an impo&s;ter, becau&s;e Mo&s;es was not an a&s;tronomer? Let us al&s;o &s;uppo&s;e, that the ac|counts of Chri&s;t's temptation in the wilderne&s;s, the devils taking refuge in the herd of &s;wine,
<PB N="51" REF="016812_0050_0F9E7F395CF792B8">with &s;everal other narrations in the New Te&s;ta|ment, frequently ridiculed by unbelievers, were all but &s;tories accommodated to the ignorance and &s;uper&s;titions of the times and countries in which they were written, or pious frauds intend|ed to impre&s;s on vulgar minds a higher reverence of the power and &s;anctity of Chri&s;t; will this in the lea&s;t impeach the excellence of his religion, or the authority of its founder? or is Chri&s;tianity an&s;werable for all the fables of which it may have been the innocent occa&s;ion? The want of this obvious di&s;tinction has much injured the Chri&s;tian cau&s;e; becau&s;e on this ground it has ever been mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sfully attacked, and on this ground it is not ea&s;ily to be defended: for if the records of this revelation are &s;uppo&s;ed to be the revelation it&s;elf, the lea&s;t defect di&s;covered in them mu&s;t be fatal to the whole. What has led many to overlook this di&s;tinction, is that com|mon phra&s;e, that the &s;criptures are the word of God; and in one &s;en&s;e they certainly are; that is, they are the &s;acred repo&s;itory of all the reve|lations, di&s;pen&s;ations, promi&s;es, and precepts, which God has vouch&s;afed to communicate to mankind; but by this expre&s;&s;ion we are not to under&s;tand, that every part of this voluminous collection of hi&s;torical, poetical, prophetical, the|ological, and moral writings, which we call the Bible, was dictated by the immediate influence of divine in&s;piration: The authors of the&s;e books pretend to no &s;uch infal&s;ibility, and if they claim it not for them&s;elves, who has authority to claim it for them? Chri&s;t required no &s;uch belief from tho&s;e who were willing to be his di&s;ciples. He &s;ays, <Q>He that believeth on me, hath everla&s;ting

He that believeth not every word contained in the Old Te&s;tament, which was then extant, or every word in the New Te&s;tament, which was to be wrote for the in&s;truction of future generations, hath not everla&s;ting life? There are innumerable occurrences related in the &s;criptures, &s;ome of greater, &s;ome of le&s;s, and &s;ome of no importance at all; the truth of which we can have no rea&s;on to que&s;tion, but the belief of them is &s;urely not e&s;&s;ential to the faith of a Chri&s;tian: I have no doubt but that St. Paul was &s;hip-wrecked, and that he left his cloak and his parchments at Tro|as; but the belief of the&s;e facts makes no part of Chri&s;tianity, nor is the truth of them any proof of its authority. It proves only that this apo&s;tle could not in common life be under the perpetual influence of infallible in&s;piration; for, had he been &s;o, he would not have put to &s;ea be|fore a &s;torm, nor have forgot his cloak. The&s;e writers were undoubtedly directed by &s;upernatural influence in all things nece&s;&s;ary to the great work, which they were appointed to perform: At particular times, and on particular occa&s;ions, they were enabled to utter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="6 letters">cies, to &s;peak languages, and to work miracles; but in all other circum&s;tances, they &s;eem to have been left to the direction of their own under&s;tandings, like other men. In the &s;ciences of hi&s;tory, geogra|phy, a&s;tronomy, and philo&s;ophy, they appear to have been no better in&s;tructed than others, and therefore were not le&s;s liable to be milled by the errors and prejudices of the times and countries in which they lived. They related facts like
<PB N="53" REF="016812_0052_0F9E7F3ADA09A640">hone&s;t men, to the be&s;t of their knowledge or information, and they recorded the divine le&s;&s;ons of their ma&s;ter with the utmo&s;t &s;idelity; but they pretended to no infallibility, for they &s;ometimes differed in their relations, and they &s;ometimes di&s;agreed in their &s;entiments. All which proves only, that they did not act, or write, in a com|bination to deceive, but not in the lea&s;t im|peaches the truth of the revelation which they publi&s;hed; which depends not on any external evidence whatever: For I will venture to affirm, that if any one could prove, what is impo&s;&s;ible to be proved, becau&s;e it is not true, that there are errors in geography, chronology, and philo|&s;ophy, in every page of the Bible; that the pro|phecies therein delivered are all but fortunate gue&s;&s;es, or artful applications, and the miracles there recorded no better than legendary tales: if any one could &s;hew, that the&s;e books were never written by their pretended authors, but were po&s;terior impo&s;itions on illiterate and credulous ages: all the&s;e wonderful di&s;coveries would prove no more than this, that God, for rea&s;ons to us unknown, had thought proper to permit a reve|lation by him communicated to mankind, to be mixed with their ignorance, and corrupted by their frauds from its earlie&s;t infancy, in the &s;ame manner in which he has vi&s;ibly permitted it to be mixed, and corrupted from that period to the pre&s;ent hour. If in the&s;e books a religion &s;upe|rior to all human imagination actually exi&s;ts, it is of no con&s;equence to the proof of its divine origin, by what means it was there introduced, or with what human errors and imperfections it is blended.

<P>To &s;ome &s;peculative and refined ob&s;ervers, it has appeared incredible, that a wi&s;e and bene|volent Creator &s;hould have con&s;tituted a world upon one plan, and a religion for it on another; that is, that he &s;hould have revealed a religion to mankind, which not only contradicts the prin|cipal pa&s;&s;ions and inclinations which he has im|planted in their natures, but is incompatible with the whole oeconomy of that world which he has created, and in which he has thought proper to place them. This, &s;ay they, with regard to the Chri&s;tian is apparently the ca&s;e: the love of pow|er, riches, honour, and fame, are the great in|citements to generous and magnanimous actions; yet by this in&s;titution are all the&s;e depreciated and di&s;couraged.

<PB N="56" REF="016812_0055_0F9E7F3EA52819A8">on this account, enter not into the &s;ublime &s;pirit of this religion, which is not a code of preci&s;e laws de&s;igned for the well ordering &s;ociety, adapted to the ends of worldly convenience, and amenable to the tribunal of human prudence; but a divine le&s;&s;on of purity and perfection, &s;o far &s;uperior to the low con&s;iderations of conque&s;t, government, and commerce, that it takes no more notice of them than of the battles of game|cocks, the policy of bees, or the indu&s;try of ants: they recollect not what is the fir&s;t and prin|cipal object of this in&s;titution; that this is not, as has been often repeated, to make us happy, or even virtuous in the pre&s;ent life, for the &s;ake of augmenting our happine&s;s here, but to con|duct us through a &s;tate of dangers and &s;ufferings, of &s;in and temptation, in &s;uch a manner as to qualify us for the enjoyment of happine&s;s here|after. All other in&s;titutions of religion and mo|rals were made for the world, but the character|i&s;tic of this is to be again&s;t it; and therefore the merits of chri&s;tian doctrines are not to be weighed in the &s;cales of public utility, like tho&s;e of moral precepts, becau&s;e worldly utility is not their end. If Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles had pre|tended, that the religion which they preached would advance the power, wealth, and pro&s;pe|rity of nations, or of men, they would have de&s;erved but little credit; but they con&s;tantly profe&s;s the contrary, and every where declare, that their religion is adver&s;e to the world, and all its pur&s;uits. Chri&s;t &s;ays, &s;peaking of his di&s;|ciples, <Q>They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xvii. 16.</NOTE></Q> It can therefore
<PB N="57" REF="016812_0056_0F9E7F3F8F280910">be no imputation on this religion, or on any of its precepts, that they tend not to an end which their author profe&s;&s;edly di&s;claims: nor can it &s;urely be deemed a defect, that it is adver&s;e to the vain pur&s;uits of this world; for &s;o are rea&s;on, wi&s;dom, and experience; they all teach us the &s;ame le&s;&s;on, they all demon&s;trate to us every day, that the&s;e are begun on fal&s;e hopes, carried on with di&s;quietude, and end in di&s;appointment. This profe&s;&s;ed incompatibility with the little, wretched, and iniquitous bu&s;ine&s;s of the world, is therefore &s;o far from being a defect in this re|ligion, that, was there no other proof of its di|vine origin, this alone, I think, would be abun|dantly &s;ufficient. The great plan and benevolent de&s;ign of this di&s;pen&s;ation is plainly this; to enlighten the minds, purify the religion, and amend the morals of mankind in general, and to &s;elect the mo&s;t meritorious of them to be &s;ucce&s;&s;ively tran&s;planted into the kingdom of heaven: Which gracious offer is impartially ten|dered to all, who by per&s;everance in meekne&s;s, patience, piety, charity, and a detachment from the world, are willing to qualify them&s;elves for this holy and happy &s;ociety. Was this univer|&s;ally accepted, and did every man ob&s;erve &s;trictly every precept of the go&s;pel, the face of human affairs and the oeconomy of the world would indeed be greatly changed; but &s;urely they would be changed for the better; and we &s;hould enjoy much more happine&s;s, even here, than at pre&s;ent: For we mu&s;t not forget, that evils are by it forbid as well as re&s;i&s;tance; injuries, as well as revenge; all unwillingne&s;s to diffu&s;e the
<PB N="58" REF="016812_0057_0F9E7F404208A528">enjoyments of life, as well as &s;olicitude to ac|quire them; all ob&s;tacles to ambition, as well as ambition it&s;elf; and therefore all contentions for power and intere&s;t would be at an end; and the world would go on much more happily than it now does. But this <HI>univer&s;al acceptance</HI> of &s;uch an offer was never expected from &s;o depraved and imperfect a creature as man, and therefore could never have been any part of the de&s;ign: For it was foreknown and foretold by him who made it; that few, very few would accept it on the&s;e terms. He &s;ays, <Q>Strait is the gate, and nar|row is the way which leadeth into life, and few there be that find it:</Q> * Accordingly we &s;ee, that very few are prevailed on by the hopes of future happine&s;s, to relinqui&s;h the pur&s;uits of pre&s;ent plea&s;ures or intere&s;ts, and therefore the&s;e pur&s;uits are little interrupted by the &s;ece&s;|&s;ion of &s;o incon&s;iderable a number: As the na|tural world &s;ub&s;i&s;ts by the &s;truggles of the &s;ame elements, &s;o does the moral by the contentions of the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions, as from the beginning: The generality of mankind are actuated by the &s;ame motives, fight, &s;cuffle, and &s;cramble for power, riches, and plea&s;ures with the &s;ame eagerne&s;s: all occupations and profe&s;&s;ions are exerci&s;ed with the &s;ame alacrity, and there are &s;oldiers, law|yers, &s;tate&s;ment, patriots, and politicians, ju&s;t as if Chri&s;tianity had never exi&s;ted. Thus, we &s;ee this wonderful di&s;pen&s;ation has an&s;wered all the purpo&s;es for which it was intended: It has en|lightened the minds, purified the religion, and amended the morals of mankind; and, without &s;ubverting the co&s;titution, policy, or bu&s;ine&s;s of
<PB N="59" REF="016812_0058_0F9E7F40DAAE0848">the world, opened a gate, though a &s;trait one' through which all, who are wi&s;e enough to choo&s;e it, and good enough to be fit for it, may find an entrance into the kingdom of heaven.</P>
<P>Others have &s;aid, that if this revelation had really been from God, his infinite power and goodne&s;s could never have &s;uffered it to have been &s;o &s;oon perverted from its original purity, to have continued in a &s;tate of corruption through the cour&s;e of &s;o many ages, and at la&s;t to have proved &s;o ineffectual to the reformation of man|kind. To the&s;e I an&s;wer, that all this, on ex|amination, will be found inevitable, from the nature of all revelations communicated to &s;o imperfect a creature as man, and from circum|&s;tances peculiar to the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of the Chri&s;tian in particular: for when this was fir&s;t preached to the gentile nations, though they were not able to with&s;tand the force of its evi|dence, and therefore received it; yet they could not be prevailed on to relinqui&s;h their old &s;uper|&s;titions, and former opinions, but cho&s;e rather to incorporate them with it: By which means it was nece&s;&s;arily mixed with their ignorance, and their learning; by both which it was equally in|jured. The people defaced its wor&s;hip by blend|ing it with their idolatrous ceremonies, and the philo&s;ophers corrupted its doctrines by weaving them up with the notions of the Gno&s;tics, My&s;|tics, and Manichaeans, the prevailing &s;y&s;tems of tho&s;e times. By degrees its irre&s;i&s;tible excellence gained over princes, potentates, and conquerors to its intere&s;ts, and it was &s;upported by their patronage: but that patronage &s;oon engaged it in their policies and conte&s;ts, and de&s;troyed that
<PB N="60" REF="016812_0059_0F9E7F41D202BBA8">excellence by which it had been acquired. At length the meek and humble profe&s;&s;ors of the go&s;pel in&s;laved the&s;e princes, and conquered the&s;e conquerers their patrons, and erected for them|&s;elves &s;uch a &s;tupendous fabric of wealth and power, as the world had never &s;een: they then propagated their religion by the &s;ame methods, by which it had been per&s;ecuted; nations were converted by fire and &s;word, and the vanqui&s;hed were baptized with daggers at their throats. All the&s;e events we &s;ee proceed from a chain of cau&s;es and con&s;equences, which could not have been broken without changing the e&s;tabli&s;hed cour&s;e of things by a con&s;tant &s;eries of miracles, or a total alteration of human nature: whil&s;t that continues as it is, the pure&s;t religion mu&s;t be corrupted by a conjunction with power and rich|es, and it will al&s;o then appear to be much more corrupted than it really is: becau&s;e many are inclined to think, that every deviation from its primitive &s;tate is a corruption: Chri&s;tianity was at fir&s;t preached by the poor and mean, in holes and caverns, under the iron rod of per&s;ecution, and therefore many ab&s;urdly conclude, that any degree of wealth or power in its mini&s;ters, or of magnificence in its wor&s;hip, are corruptions in|con&s;i&s;tent with the genuine &s;implicity of its origi|nal &s;tate: they are offended, that modern bi&s;hops &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s titles, palaces, revenues, and coaches, when it is notorious, that their prede|ce&s;&s;ors, the apo&s;tles were de&s;picable wanderers, without hou&s;es, or money, and walked on foot. The apo&s;tles indeed lived in a &s;tate of poverty and per&s;ecution attendant on their particular &s;itu|ation, and the work which they had undertaken:
<PB N="61" REF="016812_0060_0F9E7F42591DEA98">this was their misfortune, but no part of then religion, and therefore it can be no more incum|bent on their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to imitate their poverty and meanne&s;s, than to be whipped, impri&s;oned, and put to death, in compliance with their ex|ample. The&s;e are all but the &s;ugge&s;tions of envy and malevolence, but no objections to the&s;e for|tunate alterations in Chri&s;tianity and its profe&s;|&s;ors; which, if not abu&s;ed to the purpo&s;es of tyranny and &s;uper&s;tition, are in fact no more than the nece&s;&s;ary and proper effects of its more pro&s;|perous &s;ituation. When a poor man grows rich, or a &s;ervant becomes a ma&s;ter, they &s;hould take care that their exaltation prompts them not to be unju&s;t or in&s;olent; but &s;urely it is not requi&s;ite or right, that their behaviour and mode of living &s;hould be exactly the &s;ame, when their &s;ituation is altered. How far this in&s;titution has been effectual to the reformation of mankind, it is not ea&s;y now to a&s;certain, becau&s;e the enormities which prevailed before the appearance of it are by time &s;o far removed from our &s;ight, that they are &s;carcely vi&s;ible; but tho&s;e of the mo&s;t gigan|tic &s;ize &s;till remain in the records of hi&s;tory, as monuments of the re&s;t: Wars in tho&s;e ages were carried on with a ferocity and cruelty unknown to the pre&s;ent: whole cities and nations were ex|tirpated by fire and &s;word; and thou&s;ands of the vanqui&s;hed were crucified and impaled for having endeavoured only to defend them&s;elves and their country. The lives of new-born infants were then intirely at the di&s;po&s;al of their parents, who were at liberty to bring them up, or to expo&s;e them to peri&s;h by cold and hunger, or to be de|voured by birds and bea&s;ts; and this was fre|quently
<PB N="62" REF="016812_0061_0F9E7F449B484C78">practi&s;ed without puni&s;hment, and even without cen&s;ure. Gladiators were employed by hundreds to cut one another to pieces, in public theatres for the diver&s;ion of the mo&s;t polite a&s;&s;emblies; and though the&s;e combatants at fir&s;t con&s;i&s;ted of criminals only, by degrees men of the highe&s;t rank, and even ladies of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious families, enrolled them&s;elves in this honourable li&s;t. On many occa&s;ions human &s;a|crifices were ordained; and at the funerals of rich and eminent per&s;ons, great numbers of their &s;laves were murdered as victims plea&s;ing to their departed &s;pirits. The mo&s;t infamous ob&s;cenities were made part of their religious wor&s;hip, and the mo&s;t unnatural lu&s;ts publicly avowed, and celebrated by their mo&s;t admired poets. At the approach of Chri&s;tianity all the&s;e horrid abomi|nations vani&s;hed; and among&s;t tho&s;e who fir&s;t embraced it, &s;carce a &s;ingle vice was to be found: to &s;uch an amazing degree of piety, charity, temperance, patience, and re&s;ignation were the primitive converts exalted, that they &s;eem literal|ly to have been regenerated, and purified from all the imperfections of human nature; and to have pur&s;ued &s;uch a con&s;tant and uniform cour&s;e of devotion, innocence, and virtue, as, in the pre&s;ent times, it is almo&s;t as difficult for us to conceive as to imitate. If it is a&s;ked, why &s;hould not the belief of the &s;ame religion now produce the &s;ame effects? the an&s;wer is &s;hort, becau&s;e it is not believed: The mo&s;t &s;overeign medicine can perform no cure, if the patient will not be per&s;uaded to take it. Yet notwith&s;tanding all impediments, it has certainty done a great deal towards dimini&s;hing the vices and correcting the
<PB N="63" REF="016812_0062_0F9E7F456B3664A8">di&s;po&s;itions of mankind; and was it univer&s;ally adopted in belief and practice, would totally eradicate both &s;in and puni&s;hment. But this was never expected, or de&s;igned, or po&s;&s;ible, becau&s;e, if their exi&s;tence did not ari&s;e from &s;ome nece&s;&s;ity to us unknown, they never would have been permitted to exi&s;t at all; and therefore they can no more be extirpated, than they could have been prevented: for this would certainly be incompatible with the frame and con&s;titution of this world, and in all probability with that of another. And this, I think, well accounts for that re&s;erve and ob&s;curity with which this religion was at fir&s;t promulgated, and that want of irre&s;i&s;t|ible evidence of its truth, by which it might po&s;&s;ibly have been enforced. Chri&s;t &s;ays to his di&s;ciples, <Q>To you it is given to know the my&s;|tery of the kingdom of God; but unto them that are without, all the&s;e things are done in parables; that &s;eeing they may &s;ee, and not perceive, and hearing they may hear, and not under&s;tand; le&s;t at any time they &s;hould be converted, and their &s;ins &s;hould be forgiven them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mark iv. 11, 12.</NOTE></Q> That is, to you by peculiar favour it is given to know and under&s;tand the doctrines of my religion, and by that means to qualify your&s;elves for the kingdom of heaven; but to the multitude without, that is to all mankind in general, this indulgence cannot be extended; becau&s;e that all men &s;hould be exempted from &s;in and puni&s;hment is utterly repugnant to the univer&s;al &s;y&s;tem, and that con&s;titution of things, which infinite wi&s;dom has thought proper to adopt.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="016812_0063_0F9E7F464CD91FA0">
Objections have likewi&s;e been rai&s;ed to the divine authority of this religion from the incre|dibility of &s;ome of its doctrines, particularly of tho&s;e concerning the Trinity, and atonement for &s;in by the &s;ufferings and death of Chri&s;t; the one contradicting all the principles of human rea&s;on, and the other all our ideas of divine ju&s;tice. To the&s;e objections I &s;hall only &s;ay, that no argu|ments founded on principles, which we cannot comprehend, can po&s;&s;ibly di&s;prove a propo&s;ition already proved on principles which we do under|&s;tand; and therefore that on this &s;ubject they ought not to be attend to: That three Beings &s;hould be one Being, is a propo&s;ition which cer|tainly contradicts rea&s;on, that is, <HI>our</HI> rea&s;on; but it does not from thence follow, that it can|not be true; for there are many propo&s;itions which contradict our rea&s;on, and yet are de|mon&s;trably true: one is the very fir&s;t principle of all religion, the being of a God; for that any thing &s;hould exi&s;t without a cau&s;e, or that any thing &s;hould be the cau&s;e of its own exi&s;t|ence, are propo&s;itions equally contradictory to our rea&s;on; yet one of them mu&s;t be true, or nothing could ever have exi&s;ted: in like manner the over-ruling grace of the Creator, and the free-will of his creatures, his certain fore-know|ledge of future events, and the uncertain con|tingency of tho&s;e events, are to our apprehen&s;i|ons ab&s;olute contradictions to each other; and yet the truth of every one of the&s;e is demon&s;tra|ble from Scripture, rea&s;on, and experience. All the&s;e difficulties ari&s;e from our imagining, that the mode of exi&s;tence of all Beings mu&s;t be &s;imilar to our own; that is, that they mu&s;t all exi&s;t in
<PB N="65" REF="016812_0064_0F9E7F46E41B9760">time, and &s;pace; and hence proceeds our em|barra&s;&s;ment on this &s;ubject. We know, that no two Beings, with who&s;e mode of exi&s;tence we are acquainted, can exi&s;t in the &s;ame point of time in the &s;ame point of &s;pace, and that there|fore they cannot be one: but how far Beings, who&s;e mode of exi&s;tence bears no relation to time or &s;pace, may be united, we cannot com|prehend: and therefore the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch an union we cannot po&s;itively deny. In like manner our rea&s;on informs us, that the puni&s;h|ment of the innocent, in&s;tead of the guilty, is diametrically oppo&s;ite to ju&s;tice, rectitude, and all preten&s;ions to utility; but we &s;hould al&s;o re|member, that the &s;hort line of our rea&s;on cannot reach to the bottom of this que&s;tion: it cannot inform us, by what means either guilt or puni&s;h|ment ever gained a place in the works of a Cre|ator infinitely good and powerful, who&s;e good|ne&s;s mu&s;t have induced him, and who&s;e power mu&s;t have enabled him to exclude them: It can|not a&s;&s;ure us, that &s;ome &s;ufferings of individuals are not nece&s;&s;ary to the happine&s;s and well-being of the whole: It cannot convince us, that they do not actually ari&s;e from this nece&s;&s;ity, or that for this cau&s;e, they may not be required of us, and levied like a tax for the public benefit: or that this tax may not be paid by one Being, as well as another; and therefore, if volun|tarily offered, be ju&s;tly accepted from the in|nocent in&s;tead of the guilty. Of all the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances we are totally ignorant; nor can our rea&s;on afford us any information, and there|fore we are not able to a&s;&s;ert, that, this mea&s;ure is contrary to ju&s;tice, or void of utility: for,
<PB N="66" REF="016812_0065_0F9E7F47A22E4268">unle&s;s we could fir&s;t re&s;olve that great que&s;tion whence came evil? we can decide nothing on the di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence; becau&s;e they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be connected with that undi&s;coverable principle; and, as we know not the root of the di&s;ea&s;e, we cannot judge of what is, or is not, a proper and effectual remedy. It is remarkable, that, notwith&s;tanding all the &s;eeming ab&s;urdities of this doctrine, there is one circum&s;tance much in its favour; which is, that it has been univer|&s;ally adopted in all ages, as far as hi&s;tory can carry us back in our inquiries to the earlie&s;t times; in which we find all nations civilized and barbarous, however differing in all other religi|ous opinions, agreeing alone in the expediency of appea&s;ing their offended Deities by &s;acrifices, that is, by the vicarious &s;ufferings of men or other animals. This notion could never have been derived from rea&s;on, becau&s;e it directly contradicts it; nor from ignorance, becau&s;e ig|norance could never have contrived &s;o unac|countable an expedient, nor have been uniform in all ages and countries in any opinion what&s;o|ever; nor from the artifice of kings or prie&s;ts, in order to acquire dominion over the people, becau&s;e it &s;eems not adapted to this end, and we find it implanted in the minds of the mo&s;t remote &s;avages at this day di&s;covered, who have neither kings or prie&s;ts artifice, or dominion among&s;t them. It mu&s;t therefore be derived from natural in&s;tinct, or &s;upernatural revelation, <HI>both</HI> which are <HI>equally</HI> the operations of divine power. If it is further urged, that however true the&s;e doc|trines may be, yet it mu&s;t be incon&s;i&s;tent with the ju&s;tice and goodne&s;s of the Creator, to re|quire
<PB N="67" REF="016812_0066_0F9E7F485F44C6A8">from his creatures the belief of propo&s;iti|ons which contradict, or are above the reach of that rea&s;on, which he has thought proper to be|&s;tow upon them. To this I an&s;wer, that genuine Chri&s;tianity requires no &s;uch belief: It has di&s;covered to us many important truths, with which we were before intirely unacquainted, and among&s;t them are the&s;e, that three Beings are &s;ome way united in the divine e&s;&s;ence, and that God will accept of the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t as an atonement for the &s;ins of mankind. The&s;e, con|&s;idered as declarations of facts only, neither con|tradict, or are above the reach of human rea&s;on: The fir&s;t is a propo&s;ition as plain, as that three equilateral lines compo&s;e one triangle; the other is as intelligible, as that one man &s;hould di&s;charge the debts of another. In what manner this uni|on is formed, or why God accepts the&s;e vicari|ous puni&s;hments, or to what purpo&s;es they may be &s;ub&s;ervient, it informs us not, becau&s;e no in|formation could enable us to comprehend the&s;e my&s;teries, and therefore it does not require that we &s;hould know or believe any thing about them. The truth of the&s;e doctrines mu&s;t re&s;t intirely on the authority of tho&s;e who taught them; but then we &s;hould reflect that tho&s;e were the &s;ame per&s;ons who taught us a &s;y&s;tem of religion more &s;ublime, and of ethics more perfect, than any which our faculties were ever able to di&s;cover, but which when di&s;covered are exactly con&s;onant to our rea&s;on, and that therefore we &s;hould not ha&s;tily reject tho&s;e informations which they have vouch&s;afed to give us, of which our rea&s;on is not a competent judge. If an able mathemati|cian proves to us the truth of &s;everal propo&s;iti|ons
<PB N="68" REF="016812_0067_0F9E7F4918CF5568">by demon&s;trations which we under&s;tand, we he&s;itate not on his authority to a&s;&s;ent to others, the proce&s;s of who&s;e proofs we are not able to follow: why therefore &s;hould we refu&s;e that cre|dit to Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, which we think rea&s;onable to give to one another?</P>
<P>Many have objected to the whole &s;cheme of this revelation as partial, fluctuating, indetermi|nate, unju&s;t, and unworthy of an omni&s;cient and omnipotent author, who cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to have favoured particular per&s;ons, countries, and times, with this divine communication, while others no le&s;s meritorious have been altogether excluded from its benefits; nor to have changed and counteracted his own de&s;igns; that is, to have formed mankind able and di&s;po&s;ed to ren|der them&s;elves mi&s;erable by their own wicked|ne&s;s, and then to have contrived &s;o &s;trange an expedient to re&s;tore them to that happine&s;s, which they need never have been permitted to forfeit; and this to be brought about by the unnece&s;&s;ary interpo&s;ition of a mediator. To all this I &s;hall only &s;ay, that however unaccountable this may appear to us, who &s;ee but as &s;mall a part of the Chri&s;tian, as of the univer&s;al plan of creation, they are both in regard to all the&s;e circum&s;tances exactly analogous to each other. In all the di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence, with which we are acquainted, benefits are di&s;tributed in a &s;imilar manner; health and &s;trength, &s;en&s;e and &s;cience, wealth and power, are all be&s;towed on indivi|duals and communities in different degrees and at different times.

<PB N="69" REF="016812_0068_0F9E7F4B9817E090">of intermediate agents. God has permitted us to plunge our&s;elves into poverty, di&s;tre&s;s, and mi&s;ery, by our own vices, and has afforded us the advice, in&s;tructions, and exam|ples of others, to deter or extricate us from the&s;e calamities. He has formed us &s;ubject to innumerable di&s;ea&s;es, and he has be&s;towed on us a variety of remedies. He has made us liable to hunger, thir&s;t, and nakedne&s;s, and he &s;upplies us with food, drink, and cloathing, u&s;ually by the admini&s;tration of others. He has created poi&s;ons, and he has provided antidotes. He has ordained the winter's cold to cure the pe&s;tilential heats of the &s;ummer, and the &s;ummer's &s;un&s;hine to dry up the inundations of the winter. Why the con&s;titution of nature is &s;o formed, why all the vi&s;ible di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence are &s;uch, and why &s;uch is the Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation al&s;o, we know not, nor have faculties to comprehend. God might certainly have made the material world a &s;y&s;tem of perfect beauty and regularity, without evils, and without remedies; and the Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation a &s;cheme only of moral virtue productive of happine&s;s, without the in|tervention of any atonement or mediation. He might have exempted our bodies from all di&s;ea&s;es, and our minds from all depravity, and we &s;hould then have &s;tood in no need of medicines to re|&s;tore us to health, or expedients to reconcile us to his favour. It &s;eems indeed to our ignorance, that this would have been more con&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice and rea&s;on; but his infinite wi&s;dom has decided in another manner, and formed the &s;y&s;|tems both of Nature and Chri&s;tianity on other principles, and the&s;e &s;o exactly &s;imilar, that we
<PB N="70" REF="016812_0069_0F9E7F4C79826598">have cau&s;e to conclude that they both mu&s;t pro|ceed from the &s;ame &s;ource of divine power and wi&s;dom, however incon&s;i&s;tent with our rea&s;on they may appear. Rea&s;on is undoubtedly our &s;ure&s;t guide in all matters, which lie within the narrow circle of her intelligence: On the &s;ubject of revelation her provine is only to examine into its authority, and when that is once proved, &s;he has no more to do, but to acquie&s;ce in its doctrines, and therefore is never &s;o ill employed, as when &s;he pretends to accommodate them to her own ideas of rectitude and truth. God, &s;ays this &s;elf-&s;ufficient teacher, is perfectly wi&s;e, ju&s;t, and good; and what is the inference? That all his di&s;pen&s;ations mu&s;t be conformable to our no|tions of perfect wi&s;dom, ju&s;tice, and goodne&s;s: but it &s;hould fir&s;t be proved, that man is as per|fect, and as wi&s;e as his Creator, or this con&s;e|quence will by no means follow; but rather the rever&s;e, that is, that the di&s;pen&s;ations of a per|fect and all-wi&s;e Being mu&s;t probably appear un|rea&s;onable, and perhaps unju&s;t, to a Being im|perfect and ignorant; and therefore their &s;eeming impo&s;&s;ibility may be a mark of their truth, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure ju&s;tify that pious rant of a mad enthu&s;ia&s;t, "Credo, quia impo&s;&s;ible." Nor is it the lea&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing, that we are not able to under&s;tand the &s;piritual di&s;pen&s;ations of the Al|mighty, when his material works are to us no le&s;s incomprehen&s;ible, our rea&s;on can afford us no in&s;ight into tho&s;e great properties of matter, gravitation, attraction, ela&s;ticity, and electricity, nor even into the e&s;&s;ence of matter it&s;elf: Can rea&s;on teach us how the &s;un's luminous orb can fill a circle, who&s;e diameter contains many milli|ons
<PB N="71" REF="016812_0070_0F9E7F4D67EE4A40">of miles, with a con&s;tant inundation of &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive rays during thou&s;ands of years, without any perceivable diminution of that body, from whence they are continually poured, or any aug|mentation of tho&s;e bodies on which they fall, and by which they are con&s;tantly ab&s;orbed? Can rea&s;on tell us how tho&s;e rays, darted with a velo|city greater than that of a cannon ball, can &s;trike the tendere&s;t organs of the human frame without inflicting any degree of pain, or by what means this percu&s;&s;ion only can convey the forms of di&s;|tant objects to an immaterial mind? or how any union can be formed between material and im|material e&s;&s;ences, or how the wounds of the bo|dy can give pain to the &s;oul, or the anxiety of the &s;oul can emaciate and de&s;troy the body? That all the&s;e things are &s;o, we have vi&s;ible and indi&s;|putable demon&s;tration; but how they can be &s;o, is to us as incomprehen&s;ible, as the mo&s;t ab&s;tru&s;e my&s;teries of Revelation can po&s;&s;ibly be. In &s;hort, we &s;ee &s;o &s;mall a part of the great Whole, we know &s;o little of the relation, which the pre&s;ent life bears to pre-exi&s;tent and future &s;tates; we can conceive &s;o little of the nature of God, and his attributes, or mode of exi&s;tence; we can compre|hend &s;o little of the material, and &s;o much le&s;s of the moral plan on which the univer&s;e is con|&s;tituted, or on what principle it proceeds, that if a revelation from &s;uch a Being, on &s;uch &s;ubjects, was in every part familiar to our un|der&s;tandings, and con&s;onant to our rea&s;on; we &s;hould have great cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect its divine au|thority; and therefore, had this revelation been le&s;s incomprehen&s;ible, it would certainly have been more incredible.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="016812_0071_0F9E7F4D9DBD6B28">
But I &s;hall not enter further into the con&s;ide|ration of the&s;e ab&s;tru&s;e and difficult &s;peculations, becau&s;e the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of them would render this &s;hort e&s;&s;ay too tedious and laborious a ta&s;k for the peru&s;al of them, for whom it was principally in|tended; which are all tho&s;e bu&s;y or idle per&s;ons, who&s;e time and thoughts are wholly engro&s;&s;ed by the pur&s;uits of bu&s;ine&s;s, or plea&s;ure, ambition, or luxury, who know nothing of this religion, except what they have accidentally picked up by de&s;ultory conver&s;ation or &s;uperficial reading, and have thence determined with them&s;elves, that a pretended revelation founded on &s;o &s;trange and improbable a &s;tory, &s;o contradictory to rea&s;on, &s;o adver&s;e to the world and all its occupations, &s;o incredible in its doctrines, and in its precepts &s;o impracticable, can be nothing more than the im|po&s;ition of prie&s;tcraft upon ignorant and illiterate ages, and artfully continued as an engine well|adapted to awe and govern the &s;uper&s;titious vulgar. To talk to &s;uch about the Chri&s;tian religion, is to conver&s;e with the deaf concerning mu&s;ic, or with the blind on the beauties of painting: They want all ideas relative to the &s;ubject, and therefore can never be made to comprehend it: to enable them to do this, their minds mu&s;t be formed for the&s;e conceptions by contemplation, retirement, and ab&s;traction from bu&s;ine&s;s and di&s;&s;ipation, by ill-health, di&s;appoint|ments, and di&s;tre&s;&s;es; and po&s;&s;ibly by divine in|terpo&s;ition, or by enthu&s;ia&s;m, which is u&s;ually mi&s;taken for it. Without &s;ome of the&s;e prepara|tory aids, together with a competent degree of learning and application, it is impo&s;&s;ible that they can think or know, under&s;tand or believe, any
<PB N="73" REF="016812_0072_0F9E7F4E68131C08">thing about it. If they profe&s;s to believe, they deceive others; if they fancy that they believe, they deceive them&s;elves. I am ready to acknow|ledge, that the&s;e gentlemen, as far as their in|formation reaches, are perfectly in the right; and if they are endued with good under&s;tand|ings, which have been intirely devoted to the bu&s;ine&s;s or amu&s;ements of the world, they can pa&s;s no other judgment, and mu&s;t revolt from the hi&s;tory and doctrines of this religion. <Q>The preaching Chri&s;t crucified was to the Jews a &s;tumbling-block, and to the Greeks fooli&s;h|ne&s;s;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cor. i. 26.</NOTE></Q> and &s;o it mu&s;t appear to all, who, like them, judge from e&s;tabli&s;hed prejudices, fal&s;e learning, and &s;uperficial knowledge; for tho&s;e who are quite unable to follow the chain of its prophecy, to &s;ee the beauty and ju&s;tne&s;s of its moral precepts, and to enter into the wonders of its di&s;pen&s;ations, can form no other idea of this revelation, but that of a confu&s;ed rhap&s;ody of fictions and ab&s;urdities.</P>
<P>If it is a&s;ked, Was Chri&s;tianity then intended only for learned divines and profound philo&s;o|phers? I an&s;wer, No: it was at fir&s;t preached by the illiterate, and received by the ignorant; and to &s;uch are the practical, which are the mo&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;ary parts of it, &s;ufficiently intelligible: but the proofs of its authority undoubtedly are not, be|cau&s;e the&s;e mu&s;t be chiefly drawn from other parts, of a &s;peculative nature, opening to our inquiries inexhau&s;tible di&s;coveries concerning the nature, attributes, and di&s;pen&s;ations of God, which cannot be under&s;tood without &s;ome learn|ing and much attention. From the&s;e the gene|rality
<PB N="74" REF="016812_0073_0F9E7F4F1989EEF0">of mankind mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be excluded and mu&s;t therefore tru&s;t to others for the grounds of their belief, if they believe at all. And hence perhaps it is, that faith, or ea&s;ine&s;s of belief, is &s;o frequently and &s;o &s;trongly recommended in the go&s;pel; becau&s;e if men require proofs, of which they them&s;elves are incapable, and tho&s;e who have no knowledge on this important &s;ubject will not place &s;ome confidence in tho&s;e who have; the illiterate and unattentive mu&s;t ever continue in a &s;tate of unbelief: but then all &s;uch &s;hould remember, that in all &s;ciences, even in mathe|matics them&s;elves, there are many propo&s;itions, which on a cur&s;ory view appear to the mo&s;t acute under&s;tandings unin&s;tructed in that &s;cience, to be impo&s;&s;ible to be true, which yet on a clo&s;er examination are found to be truths capable of the &s;tricte&s;t demon&s;tration; and that therefore in di&s;qui&s;itions on which we cannot determine with|out much learned inve&s;tigation, rea&s;on uninform|ed is by no means to be depended on; and from hence they ought &s;urely to conclude, that it may be at lea&s;t as po&s;&s;ible for them to be mi&s;taken in di&s;believing this revelation, who know nothing of the matter, as for tho&s;e great ma&s;ters of rea|&s;on and crudition, Grotius, Bacon, Newton, Boyle, Locke, Addi&s;on, and Lyttelton, to be deceived in their belief: a belief, to which they firmly adhered after the mo&s;t diligent and learn|ed re&s;earches into the authenticity of its records, the completion of the prophecies, the &s;ublimity of its doctrines, the purity of its precepts, and the arguments of its adver&s;aries; a belief, which they have te&s;tified to the world by their writings, without any other motive, than their regard for
<PB N="75" REF="016812_0074_0F9E7F505CAA2E38">truth and the benefit of mankind. Should the few foregoing pages add but one mite to the trea&s;ures with which the&s;e learned writers have enriched the world; if they &s;hould be &s;o fortu|nate as to per&s;uade any of the&s;e minute philo&s;o|phers to place &s;ome confidence in the&s;e great opinions, and to di&s;tru&s;t their own; if they &s;hould be able to convince them, that notwith|&s;tanding all unfavourable appearances, Chri&s;tia|nity may not be altogether artifice and error; if they &s;hould prevail on them to examine it with &s;ome attention, or, if that is too much trouble, not to reject it without any examination at all; the purpo&s;e of this little work will be &s;ufficiently an&s;wered. Had the arguments herein u&s;ed, and the new hints here flung out, been more largely di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, it might ea&s;ily have been extended to a more con&s;iderable bulk; but then the bu&s;y would not have had lei&s;ure; nor the idle in|clination to have read it. Should it ever have the honour to be admitted into &s;uch good com|pany, they will immediately, I know, determine, that it mu&s;t be the work of &s;ome enthu&s;ia&s;t or methodi&s;t, &s;ome beggar, or &s;ome madman. I &s;hall therefore beg leave to a&s;&s;ure them, that the author is very far removed from all the&s;e charac|ters: that he once perhaps believed as little as them&s;elves; but having &s;ome lei&s;ure and more curio&s;ity, he employed them both in re&s;olving a que&s;tion which &s;eemed to him of &s;ome import|ance,&mdash;Whether Chri&s;tianity was really an im|po&s;ture founded on an ab&s;urd, incredible and ob&s;olete fable, as many &s;uppo&s;e it? Or whether it is, what it pretends to be, a revelation com|municated to mankind by the interpo&s;ition of
<PB N="76" REF="016812_0075_0F9E7F50D387D8F0">&s;upernatural power? On a candid inquiry, he &s;oon found, that the fir&s;t was an ab&s;olute impo&s;|&s;ibility, and that its preten&s;ions to the latter were founded on the mo&s;t &s;olid grounds: In the fur|ther pur&s;uit of his examination, he perceived, at every &s;tep, new lights ari&s;ing, and &s;ome of the brighte&s;t from parts of it the mo&s;t ob&s;cure, but productive of the cleare&s;t proofs, becau&s;e equally beyond the power of human artifice to invent, and human rea&s;on to di&s;cover. The&s;e arguments, which have convinced him of the divine origin of this religion, he has here put together in as clear and conci&s;e a manner as he was able, thinking they might have the &s;ame effect upon others, and being of opinion, that if there were a few more true Chri&s;tians in the world, it would be beneficial to them&s;elves, and by no means detrimental to the public.</P>
