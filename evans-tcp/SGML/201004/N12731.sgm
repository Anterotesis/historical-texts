<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>JOHN XVIII. 36.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Je&s;us an&s;wered, my Kingdom is not of this World.&mdash;</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is a principle, in which Chri&s;tians are generally agreed, "that the declarations of Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, which we have in the New-Te&s;tament, are of divine authority;" tho' they are not &s;o fully agreed that the&s;e are the only things, re&s;pecting chri&s;tianity, which are &s;o.</P>
<P>The Church of Rome have added hereto many of their own traditions, together with many decrees of Popes and Councils, as infallible interpreters of the word and will of God, to which they a&s;cribe an equal degree of divinity.</P>
<P>Prote&s;tants profe&s;s, indeed, to reject the&s;e, in the general, as groundle&s;s and unwarrantable additions to the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem; yet Prote&s;tants are not wholly without di&s;&s;entions among them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="016096_0005_0F9B759C8E800940">
Whether it be that &s;ome, who have rejected the gro&s;&s;er corruptions of the Romi&s;h Church, are &s;till fond of retaining &s;ome of a &s;maller &s;ize, as le&s;s hurt|ful, or more to their ta&s;te; or that length of time, and the mutable nature of language, have led them to affix different ideas to the &s;ame things&mdash;from whatever cau&s;e it hath proceeded, &s;o it is, that their conceptions of the Chri&s;tian Church, and particularly of the officers Chri&s;t hath appointed in it, and of the powers with which they are ve&s;ted, are, in &s;ome points, very different.</P>
<P>But as the Go&s;pel continues the &s;ame&mdash;as the words of Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, there recorded, remain unchanged, however mutable men's opinions or practice may be, it mu&s;t be a good rule, for de|termining what is of divine authority, and what is not, to recur to this original plan; and, by carefully examining things by it, to form and &s;ettle our own judgment.</P>
<P>By thus tracing back, to its fir&s;t principles, any &s;y&s;tem of religion, which pretends to be founded on the Go&s;pel, or to have Chri&s;t for its author, we are mo&s;t likely to di&s;tingui&s;h what is true and genuine, from what is &s;purious or apocryphal&mdash;what is from heaven, and of divine authority, from what is of this world, or the inventions of men&mdash;to &s;eparate one from the other, and to receive or reject accordingly.</P>
<P>It is agreeable to this method that I &s;hall attempt, from the pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture now read, as the foun|dation of my di&s;cour&s;e, to con&s;ider the particular &s;ubject which is, at this time, to engage our attention; I mean "The validity of Pre&s;byterian Ordination."</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="016096_0006_0F9B759D34F80730">
But what can be farther &s;aid upon a &s;ubject &s;o limited in its nature, and which has now been &s;o often handled in the rotation of this Lecture? It has been already &s;o throughly and fully examined and di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, both with re&s;pect to &s;cripture and antiquity; and particularly by one of our venerable Fathers, who&s;e di&s;cour&s;e has been made public, that little or nothing new can be added.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t, it is hoped, that can now be expected, is, that the &s;ubject may be &s;till held up in &s;ome new points of view, whereby farther light may po&s;&s;ibly be ca&s;t upon it, and &s;ome additional weight given to the arguments already u&s;ed to &s;upport and vindi|cate the practice of the&s;e churches.</P>
<P>It will be readily granted, I pre&s;ume, that by the kingdom of Chri&s;t, mentioned in my text, is intended the Church of Chri&s;t. He is a King, though not like earthly princes. The King of Zion is meek and lowly. He claims no dominion over the &s;tates of this world, as &s;uch, nor does he a&s;&s;ume any thing of the outward &s;plendor and magnificence of earthly potentates.</P>
<P>They who believe in him, as the Son of God, and the Saviour of the world&mdash;who openly acknowledge him under that important character, and &s;incerely &s;ubmit them&s;elves to the government of his &s;acred laws&mdash;All &s;uch, whether con&s;idered at large, as &s;cattered through the world, or as united together in di&s;tinct &s;ocieties, are his loyal &s;ubjects. Over the&s;e he reigns, and the&s;e are his church or kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="016096_0007_0F9B759DF5F6E160">
As divinely commi&s;&s;ioned and appointed to that important bu&s;ine&s;s, he has founded this kingdom. He is the &s;upreme head over it, and &s;ole legi&s;lator in it. The officers of this kingdom are appointed&mdash; their qualifications and powers de&s;cribed and a&s;cer|tained, and the duties of their office pointed out by him: And to him alone the &s;ubjects of this kingdom are accountable in what relates merely to their reli|gious &s;entiments and eternal &s;alvation.</P>
<P>The&s;e are things implied in the text, &s;ome of which I &s;hall particularly notice, and con&s;ider, as
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. The being and con&s;titution of the Chri&s;tian Church are of divine original.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as the founder and &s;upreme head of this &s;ociety, hath the &s;ole right and authority of making and e&s;tabli&s;hing laws, and appointing officers in it. And therefore,</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. No laws or officers in the Chri&s;tian Church are to be e&s;teemed, as of divine authority, any farther than they are laws made and officers con&s;tituted and appointed by Chri&s;t; or than as they are conformable to that original and divine plan he hath left us.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The con&s;ideration of the&s;e things may lead to &s;ome proper view of the particular point before us&mdash;may &s;et the evidence we have of the validity of pre&s;byterian ordination in a ju&s;t light, and &s;hew the weakne&s;s of &s;ome objections u&s;ually brought again&s;t it.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="016096_0008_0F9B759ED9908670">
I. The being and con&s;titution of the Chri&s;tian Church are of divine original.</P>
<P>The ju&s;tne&s;s of this ob&s;ervation from the text appears from the manner in which our Saviour ex|pre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf&mdash;<HI>My kingdom is not of this world.</HI> It took not its ri&s;e from the craft and &s;ubtilty, or from the ambition and power of men. It was not founded by human policy and wi&s;dom, but originated from heaven, and is of a divine and &s;piritual nature.</P>
<P>That the Chri&s;tian Church originated from heaven appears from the evidence we have of Chri&s;t's divine mi&s;&s;ion into the world, who was the founder and framer of it. And of the &s;ufficiency of this evidence no one can rea&s;onably doubt, who, with a fair and candid mind, &s;hall examine this evidence, as it ari&s;es from the prophecies that went before concerning Chri&s;t, compared with the corre&s;ponding events which happened, as to the time and place, and other circum|&s;tances of his birth, and the manner of his life. As it ari&s;es likewi&s;e from the many and inconte&s;tible miracles which he wrought, healing the &s;ick by a word, and rai&s;ing the dead to life, &amp;c.&mdash;from the more than human wi&s;dom and knowledge he di&s;covered&mdash; from the predictions he delivered, and their exact ac|compli&s;hment, and particularly as to his own re&s;ur|rection; and from &s;ome other things which might be mentioned to the &s;ame purpo&s;e.&mdash;No one, I imagine, who &s;hall con&s;ider the&s;e things, with a mind free from prejudice, and open to conviction, can retain a rea&s;ona|ble doubt, but that Chri&s;t was what he pretended to be &mdash;the Son of God and Saviour of the world. That he came down from heaven, as he declared, commi&s;&s;ioned and &s;ent by the Father; and that God was with him &mdash;owned and approved of him in what he did.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="016096_0009_0F9B759F8718E118">
And this being granted, it follows, that whatever Chri&s;t did, in pro&s;ecution of his important mini&s;try, was from divine authority, agreeable to what he &s;ometimes declared, that <HI>he &s;pake the words, and did the works of God.</HI></P>
<P>As acting by divine authority then we are to conceive of him, when he cho&s;e his Apo&s;tles&mdash;ap|pointed them to their important office, and &s;ent them forth as his mini&s;ters; therefore could he &s;ay with propriety&mdash;<HI>As my Father hath &s;ent me, even &s;o &s;end I you.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">John xx. 21.</NOTE></P>
<P>And the divine appointment and mi&s;&s;ion of the&s;e prime mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel was abundantly au|thenticated and confirmed by their being endued with the power of working miracles them&s;elves, to confirm the doctrines they &s;hould teach, and the facts they &s;hould relate; and particularly by their being, according to Chri&s;t's prediction and promi&s;e, filled with the Holy Gho&s;t, on the day of Penteco&s;t, when they &s;pake a variety of languages, to the a&s;to|ni&s;hment of tho&s;e who heard them.</P>
<P>Thus qualified for &s;preading the Go&s;pel through the world&mdash;for propagating and e&s;tabli&s;hing the king|dom of Chri&s;t, they received this commi&s;&s;ion from their Ma&s;ter and Lord, introduced with a declaration of his divine power and authority&mdash;<HI>All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Gho&s;t. Teaching them to ob&s;erve all things what&s;oever I have commanded you.</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxviii. 18, 19, 20.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="016096_0010_0F9B75A033662078">
Thus commi&s;&s;ioned, the Apo&s;tles &s;et out on their mini&s;try; and the &s;urprizing &s;ucce&s;s which attended their labors, may be ju&s;tly viewed as an additional evidence of their heavenly mi&s;&s;ion and of the divinity of that religion they taught. For though they appeared as &s;heep in the mid&s;t of wolves&mdash;Though they had to encounter the ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition &mdash;the bigotry and malice of this world, and met with great oppo&s;ition&mdash;with hard&s;hips and &s;ufferings, yet they triumphed over all, and &s;oon &s;pread the Go&s;pel far and wide. Many believed and turned to the Lord, and by bapti&s;m were gathered into the Church of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>This &s;ociety, &s;mall at fir&s;t, and as a grain of mu&s;tard &s;eed, pre&s;ently enlarged and &s;pread it&s;elf through the nations. Particular &s;ocieties were formed in different places&mdash;united under Je&s;us their common head, and furni&s;hed with proper officers for their religious government, in&s;truction and edification.</P>
<P>Thus was the kingdom of Chri&s;t fir&s;t &s;et up in the world. Not, as I &s;aid before, by human policy and power, but in oppo&s;ition to the&s;e. It had not its fir&s;t ri&s;e from, nor any dependence upon this world. Its being and exi&s;tence were evidently from heaven. It was the work of God&mdash;the effect of divine wi&s;dom, power and goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>And not only the fir&s;t foundation and e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the Church of Chri&s;t, but its whole frame and con&s;titution, and the great end for which it was erected, exhibit &s;trong and convincing marks of its heavenly original. Of all this we mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, if we examine the New Te&s;tament, where the nature and de&s;ign of Chri&s;t's kingdom are repre&s;ented.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="016096_0011_0F9B75A12AE8DD00">
Let us view there the laws and ordinances of this kingdom&mdash;the &s;acred rules and maxims by which the &s;ubjects of it are to be governed. They have no|thing of this world in view. They are not calculated to advance men in earthly riches and greatne&s;s, nor to elevate &s;ome above others, in worldly pomp and dignity; but they breath a cele&s;tial &s;pirit and in|fluence, and are manife&s;tly de&s;igned to rectify the di&s;orders of our minds&mdash;to improve and perfect our nature&mdash;to make us like to the ble&s;&s;ed God, and fit for tho&s;e high and noble enjoyments which are con&s;onant to our rational and moral nature.</P>
<P>Let us view there the &s;anctions of the&s;e laws. They are not taken from this world. The rewards promi&s;ed to the obedient, are not any high and honorable offices in this life, and lucrative po&s;ts and employments; nor the puni&s;hments threatned, pecu|niary mulcts, fines. impri&s;onment, or death.</P>
<P>The great motives by which the laws of Chri&s;t are enforced, lie above, and beyond the pre&s;ent &s;tate and &s;cene of things. They re&s;pect the favor or di&s;plea&s;ure of Almighty God, and everla&s;ting happi|ne&s;s or woe in a future world.</P>
<P>Nor are the officers Chri&s;t hath appointed in his kingdom like the rulers of this world. They have no lordly power and authority over his &s;ubjects, like what is exerci&s;ed by the princes of the Gentiles. In&s;tead of tyrannizing over others, they are to be their &s;ervants, mini&s;tering to them in acts of kindne&s;s and benevolence. It is their duty, indeed, to en|deavour the enlargement of Chri&s;t's kingdom, and to increa&s;e the number of his &s;ubjects, but not by any of the ho&s;tile mea&s;ures of this world&mdash;the
<PB N="13" REF="016096_0012_0F9B75A20A69A258">weapons of their warfare are not carnal. But they are to endeavour this, by preaching up a crucified Saviour, and publi&s;hing the truths of his Go&s;pel, in their purity and &s;implicity;&mdash;by enlightening men's minds, and convincing and per&s;uading their judgments, not by the ab&s;urd method of bodily tortures, or any other motives taken from this world, but by argu|ments drawn from the &s;acred oracles, and &s;uited to their intellectual nature.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s of Chri&s;t's mini&s;ters, who are officers in his kingdom, is to &s;eek e&s;pecially the &s;piritual welfare and happine&s;s of his &s;ubjects. To elevate their minds above this world&mdash;to rai&s;e their views to heaven, as their proper home, and to endeavour their preparation for that ble&s;&s;ed abode.</P>
<P>In a word. The whole frame and con&s;titution of the Chri&s;tian Church, as delineated and &s;et before us in the Go&s;pel, as well as the manner in which it was fir&s;t founded and &s;et up, declare its divine original. From heaven it took its ri&s;e, and the great de&s;ign of it is, to bring men to that glorious and happy place.</P>
<P>From this account of the being and con&s;titution of the Chri&s;tian Church, I proceed to the &s;econd thing noticed from the text.</P>
<P>II. Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as the founder and &s;upreme head of this &s;ociety, hath the &s;ole right of making and e&s;tabli&s;hing laws, and appointing officers in it.</P>
<P><HI>Je&s;us an&s;wered, my kingdom,</HI> &amp;c. He therefore is King of this eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;ociety, which implies his &s;overeign dominion over it. And it &s;eems e&s;&s;ential to his being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch dominion, that the power of legi&s;lation and government &s;hould be wholly in his hands.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="016096_0013_0F9B75A32C1B4280">
This is not the ca&s;e, indeed; I mean, it ought not to be the ca&s;e, in civil &s;tates, and cannot be, in free &s;tates, where &s;ubjects have a proper enjoyment of their ju&s;t rights. For as all human power mu&s;t originally re&s;ide in and proceed from the community, rulers, though elevated in office, yet, &s;trictly &s;peak|ing, are the creatures and &s;ervants of the people.</P>
<P>And as the highe&s;t earthly rulers are but imper|fect men&mdash;liable to mi&s;conduct through ignorance, avarice, ambition, &amp;c. it is rea&s;onable they &s;hould never be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of ab&s;olute, uncontroulable autho|rity. It is ju&s;t, and tends to the good of &s;ociety, that the &s;tate &s;hould always have this check upon the legi&s;lative and governing powers, to re&s;ume that au|thority which they have parted with, only for the common good, whenever &s;uch authority is abu&s;ed.</P>
<P>But in &s;uch re&s;pects as the&s;e, Chri&s;t's kingdom is not of this world. None of his &s;ubjects ever &s;tood upon a level with him, nor contributed any thing to that &s;upreme power of which he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. His kingdom is of his own founding and e&s;tabli&s;hing&mdash; It is his own property.</P>
<P>And be&s;ides, that on this account, he may appear to have a natural right to &s;overeign dominion, he is eminently qualified to exerci&s;e &s;uch dominion, with|out ever abu&s;ing it.</P>
<P>The ab&s;olute rectitude of his nature&mdash;the per|fection of his wi&s;dom and knowledge, and his con|&s;ummate goodne&s;s, render it impo&s;&s;ible but that his laws and government &s;hould be always ju&s;t and right, and calculated for the good and happine&s;s of his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="016096_0014_0F9B75A334601C90">
And Chri&s;t being thus head over all things to the Church, a &s;uppo&s;ition that any, be&s;ides him, may have power of legi&s;lation and government in it, is wholly without foundation. For &s;uch mu&s;t act either independently of him, and by an authority of their own; or el&s;e as his delegates, and by a power derived from him; neither of which can be the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>For to &s;uppo&s;e they act independently of him, is mo&s;t obviou&s;ly incon&s;i&s;tent with his own &s;upremacy. This is at once to dethrone him, and take his king|dom out of his hands. And as to any one's acting by delegation, or as having received power and au|thority from him, to make laws, and appoint officers in his kingdom, of this we have not the lea&s;t intima|tion in the New-Te&s;tament. Chri&s;t has con&s;tituted no &s;uch law-makers and vicegerents in his church; and we have abundant rea&s;on to conclude he never intended there &s;hould be any. He has given it in &s;olemn charge to all his &s;ubjects, not to a&s;&s;ume or pretend to any &s;uch authority, nor to &s;ubmit to it if u&s;urped, or claimed by others. <HI>Call no man your Father upon earth&mdash;neither be ye called Ma&s;ters. One is your Father who is in heaven&mdash;One is your Ma&s;ter even Chri&s;t, and all ye are brethren.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxiii, 8, 9, 10.</NOTE></P>
<P>And this &s;upreme dominion and authority of our exalted Redeemer mu&s;t have re&s;pect, not only to the &s;imple acts of making laws and appointing officers in his kingdom, but to whatever will have influence on the nature and operation of laws; as for in&s;tance&mdash; the particular &s;en&s;e in which they are to be under&s;tood and obeyed.&mdash;And to whatever will affect the bu&s;ine&s;s of officers&mdash;as their rank and dignity, and the powers committed to them. This will be evident on a moment's reflection.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="016096_0015_0F9B75A3F31C8C88">
For, let it be &s;uppo&s;ed that any man, or body of men, have authority to determine the &s;en&s;e of certain doctrines or laws of Chri&s;t, &s;o as to oblige others to receive them in <HI>their</HI> particular &s;en&s;e, it is obvious &s;uch men may, by virtue of their own interpretation, alter the nature of the&s;e doctrines and laws, ju&s;t as they plea&s;e; and may ab&s;olutely annihilate them, as to their original intention. And the&s;e authoritative interpreters would, in effect, be the legi&s;lators and rulers in Chri&s;t's kingdom, in contradiction to his own acknowledged &s;upremacy and dominion.</P>
<P>So likewi&s;e, if new officers &s;hould be added to tho&s;e Chri&s;t hath appointed in his kingdom, or, which amounts to much the &s;ame, if tho&s;e he hath con&s;tituted &s;hould be altered, and made different from what they were&mdash;if, for in&s;tance, that equality which, 'tis &s;uppo&s;ed, the New-Te&s;tament clearly points out between bi&s;hops and pre&s;byters or elders&mdash;if this equality &s;hould be de&s;troyed&mdash;it &s;ome of the&s;e &s;hould be exalted above others in dignity and power&mdash;&s;hould be rai&s;ed to di&s;tingui&s;hed honors and privileges, and authorized to perform peculiar acts, from which others are excluded, as incapable, it is manife&s;t that by &s;uch changes and alterations in the Chri&s;tian Church, it would become quite a different thing from what it was when fir&s;t con&s;tituted. It could be, <HI>but in part,</HI> the kingdom of Chri&s;t; in part it mu&s;t be a kingdom of this world; or the kingdom of tho&s;e men, who made the&s;e changes and alterations in it.</P>
<P>But now, Chri&s;t being the &s;upreme and &s;overeign Lord over his own Church or kingdom&mdash;being the &s;ole legi&s;lator and authoritative ruler in it, mu&s;t intirely and forever exclude all others from any &s;uch
<PB N="17" REF="016096_0016_0F9B75A7728F67B8">authority and power&mdash;from any authority to make new laws, or appoint new officers in his kingdom&mdash; from all authority even to interpret any of his laws or doctrines, &s;o as to oblige others to receive and obey them, in their particular &s;en&s;e. And, as intirely mu&s;t this exclude all others from authority to make any di&s;tinctions among the officers of his kingdom, which he hath not made;&mdash;to give powers to &s;ome which he has not granted, or to deprive others of tho&s;e with which he has inve&s;ted them.</P>
<P>And if this rea&s;oning is ju&s;t, it follows, I conceive, as an undeniable con&s;equence.</P>
<P>III. That no laws or officers now in the Chri&s;tian Church are to be e&s;teemed as of divine autho|rity, any farther than they are laws made and officers con&s;tituted and appointed by Chri&s;t or, than as they are conformable to that original divine plan he has left us.</P>
<P>This conclu&s;ion re&s;ults from its being manife&s;tly incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;upreme dominion of Chri&s;t in his own kingdom, that any be&s;ides him, and inde|pendent of him, &s;hould have authority to act as le|gi&s;lators and rulers in it. Any laws, therefore, or officers, which have taken place in the Chri&s;tian Church, and appear not; or, &s;o far as they appear not, to have been made and con&s;tituted by Chri&s;t, we are not to look upon as properly belonging to his kingdom, nor as of divine authority.</P>
<P>And this naturally brings us to con&s;ider and ex|amine the particular point we have in view, viz. "the article of pre&s;byterian ordination."</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="016096_0017_0F9B75CF75062C48">
I cannot per&s;uade my&s;elf, indeed, but that, if all controver&s;y was out of &s;ight, no one could rea&s;onably doubt the validity of ordination by Pre&s;byters or Elders, who, with a fair and hone&s;t mind, &s;hould examine that plan of the Chri&s;tian Church the Go&s;pel &s;ets before us.</P>
<P>We, as Di&s;&s;enters from the Church of England or rather, as forming our &s;entiments by the &s;acred Scriptures, believe and a&s;&s;ert this validity. The Churches in this country, in general, with many el&s;e|where, practi&s;e upon this principle; and, we doubt not, God approves our practice&mdash;has greatly ble&s;&s;ed, and will continue to ble&s;s the mini&s;trations of his &s;ervants thus ordained.</P>
<P>Epi&s;copalians, as they are called, zealou&s;ly oppo&s;e us in this point, and repre&s;ent our ordinations as null and void. And it is oppo&s;ition from this quarter, and not any doubtful circum&s;tances, attending the &s;ubject it&s;elf, upon a &s;cripture view of it, which has rendered the defence of this article important, and, 'tis likely, gave ri&s;e to this lecture, in the mind of the hono|rable founder.</P>
<P>It is an avowed principle of the Church of England, and no immaterial part of the foundation of its pre|&s;ent grand hierarchy, that Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters are not the &s;ame, but two di&s;tinct officers in the Church of Chri&s;t;&mdash;that Bi&s;hops are an order &s;uperior in rank and dignity, and have, in particular, the power of ordaining others, or &s;eparating them to the go&s;pel-mini&s;try, which Pre&s;byters have not.</P>
<P>In &s;upport of the&s;e &s;entiments, &s;ome writers on that &s;ide the que&s;tion have laid great weight on what, they &s;ay were the opinions and practice of the church in the early ages of it, and even from the Apo&s;tles days.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="016096_0018_0F9B75D045839B18">
But any con&s;iderable acquaintance with the ancient hi&s;tory of the church mu&s;t &s;atisfy the unprejudiced, that no argument of any force can be drawn from thence. For it is manife&s;t, and is acknowledged by &s;ome of the mo&s;t learned and judicious of Epi&s;copalians them&s;elves, that, in the earlie&s;t ages, the words Pre&s;by|ter and Bi&s;hop were u&s;ed, as they were by the in|&s;pired writers, without any di&s;crimination; and in|tended per&s;ons of one and the &s;ame office.</P>
<P>In times more remote from the apo&s;tolic age, when, through length of time, and the lu&s;ts of men, various corruptions had crept into the church, it is readily acknowledged the&s;e words were u&s;ed, by &s;ome wri|ters, to point out different officers; and the Bi&s;hop was then exalted above his brother Pre&s;byter.</P>
<P>But this was not the only innovation which took place in the church, nor was the exalted Bi&s;hop the only new officer who was con&s;tituted and &s;et up in it.</P>
<P>There &s;oon entered, and by the &s;ame door, <HI>Sub|deacons, Archdencons, Archbi&s;hops, Patriarchs, &amp;c.</HI> with a long catalogue of religious rites and ceremo|nies, which were introduced, not all at once, indeed, but <HI>gradatim et paulatim,</HI> to beautify and adorn the church, and edify its members.</P>
<P>The&s;e all &s;tand upon the &s;ame bottom with Bi&s;hops, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from Pre&s;byters, and were created by the &s;ame power, i. e. human power. They all are the inventions and in&s;titutions of unin&s;pired and fallible men.</P>
<P>Some of the&s;e might originate, 'tis probable, from pious views and de&s;igns, in the weak and injudicious &mdash;others from the pride and ambition of a corrupt
<PB N="20" REF="016096_0019_0F9B75D0F2DAE3F0">clergy, who impo&s;ed on the ignorance and &s;uper|&s;tition of the vulgar; and others might &s;pring from other cau&s;es.</P>
<P>But we mean not to &s;ettle the point before us by human authorities; and it &s;eems, indeed, but a u&s;ele&s;s kind of parade, to mu&s;ter the Fathers, as they are called&mdash;to mar&s;hal them on oppo&s;ite &s;ides, and play them off again&s;t one another.</P>
<P>Having the in&s;pired writings for our in&s;tructor and guide, it is of but very little con&s;equence, in this controver&s;y, what the Fathers, or other fallible men, have wrote or practi&s;ed&mdash;what opinions or cu&s;toms they have approved or condemned, e&s;pecially &s;ince they have &s;o often contradicted one another, and them&s;elves too.</P>
<P>As to all innovations upon the &s;cripture plan, our Saviour's remark, re&s;pecting divorce, is a &s;ufficient confutation of them&mdash;<HI>But from the beginning it was not &s;o</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. xix. 8.</NOTE></P>
<P>Our appeal is to the &s;acred books of the New-Te&s;tament, where we have, from divine in&s;piration, the only account we can fully depend on, of the fir&s;t foundation and con&s;titution of the Chri&s;tian Church; &mdash;of its laws, ordinances, officers, &amp;c. And there it appears, in a light &s;ufficiently clear and &s;trong, that Bi&s;hops, and Pre&s;byters or Elders, were the &s;ame officers in the Church of Chri&s;t;&mdash;that there was no difference in their qualifications, their powers, or employments.</P>
<P>It will not be expected I &s;hould mention all tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages in the &s;acred oracles, which might be pertinent on this occa&s;ion. I &s;hall take notice only
<PB N="21" REF="016096_0020_0F9B75D22045F680">of two or three, which may be &s;ufficient to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e. The fir&s;t is in Tit. i. 5, 7. where the Apo&s;tles Paul tells Titus he <HI>left him in Crete&mdash;to ordain Elders in every city.</HI> He then &s;hews how the&s;e Elders were to be qualified. <HI>If any man be blamele&s;s,</HI> &amp;c. and immediately adds this rea&s;on of his advice &mdash; <HI>For a Bi&s;hop mu&s;t be blamele&s;s.</HI> The word <HI>for</HI> there is evidently cau&s;al, and &s;hews the identity of office between an Elder or Pre&s;byter, and a Bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>Titus was to take care that the per&s;ons he or|dained <HI>Elders</HI> were of blamele&s;s character; and for this rea&s;on, becau&s;e a Bi&s;hop mu&s;t be <HI>&s;o.</HI> But to what purpo&s;e could this be &s;aid, or with what propriety, unle&s;s an Elder and a Bi&s;hop were the &s;ame in office? And from his pa&s;&s;age it appears, not only that the office of a Bi&s;hop and Elder was the &s;ame, but that their qualifications were the &s;ame likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>The next place I &s;hall mention is in Acts xx. 17. Where we read that Paul being at Miletus, &s;ent to Ephe&s;us for the Elders of the church, to take his la&s;t leave of them, and to give them his &s;olemn parting charge. To the&s;e Elders he thus addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the 28th ver&s;e. <HI>Take heed unto your&s;elves, and to all the flock over which the Holy Gho&s;t hath made you over&s;eers</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign"> bi&s;hops) <HI>to feed the the Church of God, which he hath purcha&s;ed with his own blood.</HI></P>
<P>Here it is manife&s;t, not only that Elders were Bi&s;hops, or that their office was one and the &s;ame, but that the work a&s;&s;igned them, in the execution of their office, was the &s;ame al&s;o, viz. <HI>to feed the Church of God.</HI> The word <GAP DESC="foreign"> here rendered <HI>to feed,</HI> is of &s;omewhat exten&s;ive meaning, and may
<PB N="22" REF="016096_0021_0F9B75D311739720">&s;ignify to pre&s;ide over, and govern the church by the laws of Chri&s;t, as well as to mini&s;ter to it in other re&s;pects. Elders and Bi&s;hops had therefore the &s;ame power committed to them in the Church of Chri&s;t, and were authorized and directed to perform the &s;ame mini&s;terial &s;ervice.</P>
<P>And this may appear &s;till farther evident from one pa&s;&s;age more I &s;hall mention, which is in I Pet. v 1, 2. <HI>The Elders which are among you I exhort, who am al&s;o an Elder, &amp;c. feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the over&s;ight thereof</HI> [<GAP DESC="foreign"> performing the office of Bi&s;hops] <HI>not by con&s;traint, but willingly,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I am not in&s;en&s;ible that &s;ome objections have been offered again&s;t the plain and obvious &s;en&s;e of the above pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture: But the&s;e have been &s;o often con&s;idered, and &s;o fully removed, that I &s;hall take no notice of them; nor of attempts which have been made to prove a &s;uperiority of rank and power in Bi&s;hops above Pre&s;byters, from the &s;uppo&s;ed Epi&s;copacy of Timothy and Titus. The &s;uppo&s;i|tion that the&s;e two Evangeli&s;ts po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed epi&s;copal powers, which Presbyters did not, is &s;o intirely without any &s;cripture foundation, that it merits not our con|&s;ideration, any more than the doctrine of an uninter|rupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Bi&s;hops, in the modern form, even from the time of the Apo&s;tles; and &s;ome other things which over-zealous and whim&s;ical men have laid &s;tre&s;s upon.</P>
<P>Our appeal, as I &s;aid before, is to the &s;acred books of the New-Te&s;tament, where we have the words of divine in&s;piration to determine our judgment and practice.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="016096_0022_0F9B75D47100A1C8">
And it appears, I conceive, with &s;ufficient evidence, from the pa&s;&s;ages above quoted, as well as from many others which might be mentioned, that, according to the con&s;titution and pattern of the Chri&s;tian Church, left us by Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, the names Bi&s;hop and Pre&s;byter or Elder, were u&s;ed indi&s;criminately, to &s;ignify or point out per&s;ons of one and the &s;ame office:&mdash;that their qualifications, their authority, and the work a&s;&s;igned to them, were preci&s;ely the &s;ame.</P>
<P>They were equally authorized therefore to preach the word, to admini&s;ter the ordinances of the Go&s;pel, to ordain, or &s;olemnly to &s;eparate other meet per&s;ons, to the go&s;pel mini&s;try; and to perform any other &s;ervice which belonged to their office as mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t. From all which we may very ju&s;tly and &s;afely conclude the validity of ordination by Pre&s;byters.</P>
<P>For if the office of the&s;e and of Bi&s;hops was the &s;ame, and the work appointed to each of them, as mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, was the &s;ame, it will then follow, as a ju&s;t conclu&s;ion, that ordination by Pre&s;byters is &s;criptural and valid, &s;uppo&s;ing that the Act of or|daining others was a part of the work a&s;&s;igned them.</P>
<P>True, our opponents may &s;ay, &s;uppo&s;ing this&mdash; &s;uppo&s;ing the act of ordaining others, to be a part of the work a&s;&s;igned to Pre&s;byters, or even to Pre&s;byters and Bi&s;hops in common, then this conclu&s;ion might be ju&s;t; but this is denied.</P>
<P>We grant that a power of ordination exi&s;ted in the fir&s;t ordinary and &s;tanding mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, and hath de&s;cended down from them to others, by Chri&s;t's appointment; but then this power was only in Bi&s;hops, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from Pre&s;byters.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="016096_0023_0F9B75D4B46D0928">
To this objection, which re&s;ts wholly upon an arbitrary di&s;tinction between the office and power of Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters, it would be a &s;ufficient an&s;wer, to ob&s;erve, that we have in&s;tances, in the New-Te&s;tament, of ordination performed by per&s;ons under the name of Pre&s;byters, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. iv. 13, 14. Acts xiii. 1, 2, 3.</NOTE> but not a &s;ingle in|&s;tance of any performed by per&s;ons under the name of Bi&s;hops; from whence we might fairly conclude, that if there was any di&s;tinction of office and power between the&s;e, Pre&s;byters and not Bi&s;hops had power to ordain.</P>
<P>But I chu&s;e to re&s;t the point, at pre&s;ent, upon that identity of office, of power, and of work or &s;ervice we have fully proved between Pre&s;byters and Bi&s;hops.</P>
<P>There is no di&s;pute between Epi&s;copalians and us, as to Bi&s;hops having, in the apo&s;tolic age, a divine right to ordain others. This we believe and a&s;&s;ert equally with them. And it being evident, to de|mon&s;tration, that at that time, the words Bi&s;hop and Pre&s;byter were convertible terms, and u&s;ed indiffer|ently for each other;&mdash;that Bi&s;hops were Pre&s;byters, and Pre&s;byters Bi&s;hops;&mdash;that their qualifications, their office, their power and bu&s;ine&s;s were the &s;ame, the conclu&s;ion is fair and ju&s;t, that ordination by Pre&s;byters is &s;criptural and valid.</P>
<P>And it follows likewi&s;e, from what hath been &s;aid above, of the equality and &s;amene&s;s of Bi&s;hop and Pre&s;byter, that whatever di&s;tinction between the&s;e has taken place &s;ince the apo&s;tolic age&mdash;whatever &s;uperiority in rank, and dignity of office, or of power in the Church of Chri&s;t, a Bi&s;hop is &s;uppo&s;ed now to have, above a Pre&s;byter, is a di&s;tinction and
<PB N="25" REF="016096_0024_0F9B75D8AD49DB58">&s;uperiority without any foundation. A Bi&s;hop, thus di&s;tingui&s;hed and elevated is no officer in the church or kingdom of Chri&s;t, but merely of human invention and creation.</P>
<P>And in the &s;ame light we ju&s;tly view a large number of others, as <HI>Canons, Deans, Archbi&s;hops, Chancellors,</HI> &amp;c. Of the&s;e, and of &s;ome other officers, tho of high importance in the Church of England, we read nothing in the New-Te&s;tament. They have neither name, nor place, nor work a&s;&s;igned to them, in the divine con&s;titution and form of the Church of Chri&s;t which is there exhibited. They are all officers of men's creating and &s;etting up. Their exi&s;tence and authority are not from Chri&s;t, the di|vine founder and &s;upreme head of the Church, but wholly from this world.</P>
<P>But from this &s;ome may be ready to conclude, I am for cutting off the Church of England, from being any part of the Church of Chri&s;t;&mdash;for demoli&s;hing all her officers, and nullifying all her admini&s;trations. But &s;uch conclu&s;ions as the&s;e, from what I have &s;aid, would not be &s;trictly ju&s;t. Nor do I mean to retaliate upon our epi&s;copal brethren, by any hard and uncharitable reflections.</P>
<P>I &s;incerely wi&s;h the character of that Church may be ever &s;upported, and appear re&s;pectable in the eyes of all Chri&s;tians, &s;o far as it is built on the foun|dation of the Apo&s;tles and Prophets, Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf being the chief corner &s;tone.</P>
<P>I doubt not but great and good men&mdash;&s;incere di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, have, and &s;till belong to that e&s;tabli&s;hment; and that &s;ome of its mo&s;t dignified clergy have been eminently &s;ervicable in promoting
<PB N="26" REF="016096_0025_0F9B75DE20F608B8">the true intere&s;t of the Redeemer's kingdom: Nor do I doubt its being a part of the Church of Chri&s;t, notwith&s;tanding the many human additions which &s;till adhere to it.</P>
<P>But then the&s;e additions&mdash;all its deviations from the &s;cripture pattern, cannot be ju&s;tly e&s;teemed any part of its character, as a Church of Chri&s;t, but &s;o many corruptions it has unhappily received, and &s;till retains; and which, in&s;tead of adding to its true beauty and glory, really disfigure and deform it. The&s;e are not gold, &s;ilver and precious &s;tones, built on Chri&s;t, the only foundation, but wood, hay and &s;tubble, which the power of truth may in time, purge and purify it from.</P>
<P>And tho' the Church of Chri&s;t knows no &s;uch officers as Bi&s;hops, of &s;uperior rank and power to Pre&s;byters, yet I charitable believe ordination by the&s;e may be valid. Not indeed, as they are Bi&s;hops, in a prelatical &s;en&s;e, but as they are Scripture Bi&s;hops, and the &s;ame in rank and office with Pre&s;byters. For it is only in this view of them, that they can ju&s;tly be con&s;idered as officers in Chri&s;t's kingdom, and as having any divine right to ordain: In the other view, all their authority is from this world, and is, therefore, in reality, no authority at all.</P>
<P>So that if our ordinations by Pre&s;byters are not more valid than tho&s;e by Bi&s;hops, they certainly can|not be le&s;s &s;o, unle&s;s an authority derived from men&mdash; merely from this world, may be &s;uppo&s;ed greater and better than an authority derived from heaven.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now beg your farther patience, only 'till I offer a few reflections upon, or inferences from what hath been &s;aid. And,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="27" REF="016096_0026_0F9B75DF59FF2E90">
1. The Chri&s;tian Church being of divine original, we &s;hould ever look on its con&s;titution as &s;acred and inviolable.</P>
<P>Every work of God is perfect in its kind, nor are we able to improve upon, and mend, what was de|&s;igned and executed by infinite wi&s;dom. The mo&s;t pious views and motives will not ju&s;tify us in attempt|ing this, as we have neither authority nor capacity for &s;uch bu&s;ine&s;s. Corruptions in the Church, 'tis highly probable, were early introduced, by a di&s;po|&s;ition to mend it, or make alterations to its advantage. Good men, but weak and injudicious, imagined that an officer of higher rank and greater power, than a common Pre&s;byter, would have more influence in correcting abu&s;es in the Church, keeping out here&s;ies, &amp;c. Hence, 'tis likely, the office of a Bi&s;hop, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from, and &s;uperior to Pre&s;byter, fir&s;t took its ri&s;e. Other alterations might proceed from the &s;ame cau&s;e, and many from other cau&s;es much le&s;s ju&s;tifiable.</P>
<P>Corruptions once begun, were carried from one degree to another, 'till, in &s;ome places, what was called the Church of Chri&s;t, had very little of its original form left, and became almo&s;t intirely a kingdom of this world.</P>
<P>Bi&s;hops, in particular, were not only rai&s;ed above Pre&s;byters, but their elevation gradually increa&s;ed. They were made Archbi&s;hops, Patriarchs, &amp;c. And, in &s;ome places, in addition to their epi&s;copal dignities, they were created <HI>Counts, Marqui&s;&s;es, Dukes;</HI> and have &s;ometimes claimed and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the <HI>Regalia</HI> of &s;o|vereign Princes. They have given laws to nations, and battle to their enemies, at the head of numerous armies of their own rai&s;ing. This was making the Church of Chri&s;t a church militant indeed.</P>

But how unlike to the meek and benevolent Son of God, who came not to de&s;troy men's lives, but to &s;ave them, mu&s;t the&s;e military heroes appear, who pretend|ed to be his di&s;ciples, and officers in his kingdom?</P>
<P>Now, as &s;uch gro&s;s corruptions proceeded from &s;mall alterations, at fir&s;t, in the &s;cripture plan, how cautious &s;hould we be of ever attempting any thing of this nature! How inviolable &s;hould we hold the in&s;titutions of heaven!</P>
<P>And it is by a clo&s;e and &s;teadfa&s;t adherence to that divine pattern left us by Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, that we may hope the truth, as it in Je&s;us, will, in time, prevail over error and &s;uper&s;tition, and, by its power|ful efficacy, remove, by degrees, all tho&s;e human alterations, which have &s;o greatly mutilated and de|formed the church;&mdash;will re&s;tore it to its original purity and glory, when it will appear again, to its friends, fair as the moon, and clear as the &s;un; and to its enemies, terrible as an army with banners.</P>

And if we approve our&s;elves to him, we need not be greatly anxious as to what men may judge or &s;ay of us.</P>
<P N="3">3. Upon the principles which have been now laid down and e&s;tabli&s;hed, our di&s;&s;ent from the Church of England&mdash;our rejection of her form of government&mdash;of her rites and ceremonies, mu&s;t be forever ju&s;tified.</P>
<P>We di&s;&s;ent from her in no article, but where we are well per&s;uaded &s;he her&s;elf has di&s;&s;ented from the Scripture Plan. We reject nothing, but what we are well per&s;uaded had its ri&s;e and e&s;tabli&s;hment from the inventions and power of men. We &s;eparate from her, only &s;o far as we believe &s;he has deviated from the form and con&s;titution of Chri&s;t's kingdom, and is become a kingdom of this world. And thus far, even our allegiance to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as our only &s;upreme head, our lawgiver, our ruler and judge, obliges us to di&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>In&s;tead therefore of imagining our fore-fathers were guilty of &s;chi&s;m, of which they and their fol|lowers have been often accu&s;ed, in &s;eparating from the Church of England, and ca&s;ting off the yoke under which they had groaned, we ought to venerate and honor their memories, for that pious zeal and fortitude they di&s;covered, in a&s;&s;erting the liberty wherewith Chri&s;t had made them free: And that from a regard to their own con&s;ciences, and the honor
<PB N="30" REF="016096_0029_0F9B75E176E18F80">of their divine Lord, they &s;ubmitted to hard&s;hips and &s;ufferings, in planting churches in this land, more conformable to the go&s;pel pattern.</P>
<P>And it certainly becomes us their de&s;cendents, who reap the happy fruits of their trials, not to become again entangled with the yoke of bondage; but to &s;tand fa&s;t in that liberty they have tran&s;mitted to us.</P>
<P>And from the &s;ame principles which ju&s;tify our di&s;&s;ent, in general, from the epi&s;copal form and go|vernment of the church, we conclude, and with the greate&s;t rea&s;on, the validity of ordination by Pre&s;by|ters, or Scripture-Bi&s;hops.</P>
<P>For, by examining the con&s;titution of the church, or kingdom of Chri&s;t&mdash;its doctrines and laws&mdash;the officers he hath appointed in it&mdash;their qualifications and powers, and the work he has a&s;&s;igned to them, as the&s;e things are placed before us in the New-Te&s;tament&mdash; upon &s;uch examination, we find it evi|dent, beyond all rea&s;onable doubt, that Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters had one and the &s;ame office, and equal authority to perform all mini&s;terial &s;ervices, and therefore ordination among the re&s;t. And the ob|jections to this, from our opponents, being grounded, mainly, on a &s;uppo&s;ed &s;uperiority of Bi&s;hops to Pre&s;byters, and re&s;ting on unwarrantable alterations in the Church of Chri&s;t, and receiving therefore all their force from human authority, ought not, in the deci&s;ion of the pre&s;ent point, to have the weight of a feather.</P>
<P>And I cannot but recommend it to all&mdash;to the young gentlemen of this Society in particular, and e&s;pecially to &s;uch of them as are de&s;igned for the
<PB N="31" REF="016096_0030_0F9B75E233F0A950">go&s;pel mini&s;try, to give clo&s;e attention to the &s;acred Scriptures in their examination of this &s;ubject. Your looking back into antiquity, will, indeed be no di&s;|advantage to you, nor to the practice or cau&s;e of the&s;e Churches, if you can take a proper exten&s;ive view of what has been wrote relative to this controver&s;y.</P>
<P>But then remember that after all your re&s;earches, the &s;acred Scriptures ought to be your guide. The words of Chri&s;t, and of his Apo&s;tles, are not only more ancient than tho&s;e of the Fathers, as they are called, and of later writers, but they alone are of divine authority, and ought to determine and &s;ettle our judgment, in all things of a religious nature.</P>
<P>And I am per&s;uaded that the more the pre&s;ent point is viewed and examined by the light of Scrip|ture, the evidence for the validity of pre&s;byterian ordination will appear brighter and &s;tronger, and triumph over all objection.</P>
<P>To conclude,</P>
<P>Let it be the concern of all, that they are the true and real &s;ubjects of the kingdom of Chri&s;t. A reli|gion &s;o evidently divine as that which the Go&s;pel teaches, and the great de&s;ign of which is &s;o infinitely gracious, mu&s;t, in the highe&s;t degree, de&s;erve our attention; and greatly &s;olicitous &s;hould we all be, that we experience its &s;anctifying and &s;aving influence.</P>
<P>But our beloved &s;ons, the &s;tudents in this place, for who&s;e welfare we feel a parental tenderne&s;s, will &s;uffer me, in a particular manner, to recommend this to them.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="016096_0031_0F9B75E2F8A59E10">
Amid&s;t all your &s;tudies of the liberal arts and &s;ciences, and to acquire tho&s;e literary accompli&s;hments, which may ju&s;tly adorn your character, and render you u&s;eful members of &s;ociety, let me reque&s;t it of you, not to neglect the &s;tudy of your&s;elves, and a proper cultivation of your own minds, in a moral view.</P>
<P>Conver&s;e much with the &s;acred cla&s;&s;ics. Make the doctrines and laws of Chri&s;t familiar to you. Often compare your&s;elves with, and examine your|&s;elves by them; and be concerned that every thing yet ami&s;s in your tempers or lives, be rectified by the grace of the Go&s;pel;&mdash;that you are daily improving in the true and &s;olid virtues of Chri&s;tianity, and ripen|ing for that &s;tate of endle&s;s glory and felicity, which &s;hall be the portion of the righteous.</P>
<P>Believe me, my young friends, all the glittering charms of this pre&s;ent world, &s;o apt to engage and captivate the mind in early life, are but gilded dancing bubbles, which vani&s;h in a moment, compared with this.</P>
<P>And may we all &s;o conduct through the pre&s;ent &s;tate, as to be accepted of our great lawgiver, ruler and judge, and find our lot among his faithful &s;ub|jects, at that important time, when having put down all rule, and all authority and power, and &s;ubdued all his and his church's enemies, he &s;hall deliver up the kingdom to the Father, and God &s;hall be all and in all.</P>
