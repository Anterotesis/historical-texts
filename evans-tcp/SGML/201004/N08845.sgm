<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are many who have, by &s;ome means or other, &s;uch an aver&s;ion to all controver&s;y and di&s;putes about matters of religion, and look on them to be &s;o dangerous and hurtful, that they take the utmo&s;t care to keep at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from every thing of this kind; and are con&s;tantly cautioning others again&s;t it, and refu&s;ing to enter into any debate with them; unle&s;s perhaps they will <HI>di&s;pute</HI> a little again&s;t <HI>di&s;puting.</HI> The&s;e cannot hear of a public controver&s;y, or, as many of them call it, <HI>a paper war,</HI> about any thing that relates to religion, without great di&s;gu&s;t, and expre&s;&s;ing their &s;orrow that there &s;hould be any &s;uch thing, e&s;pecial<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y between the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel. And doubtle&s;s many have expre&s;&s;ed their di&s;plea|&s;ure and grief at the controver&s;y which has taken place between Mr. Mills and me; and have determined, for their part, not to concern them&s;elves with it, &s;o much as to read what is wrote.</P>
<P>Many of the&s;e are &s;o mode&s;t as to &s;ay they do not pretend to be competent judges of &s;uch controverted points, which great and good men are not able to agree in, and &s;ettle. Be&s;ides, they have no time to &s;pend upon the&s;e thorny di&s;|putes: They think they can be better employed in reading plain, practical divinity.</P>
<P>If any of the&s;e &s;hould venture &s;o near &s;o large a book of controver&s;y as is the en&s;uing, as to look into the preface, they may be de&s;ired to con&s;ider the following things.</P>
<P>Whether they are not neglecting that attention, and free and earne&s;t inquiry after the truth, without which they are like to live and die, in a great degree of ignorance. And whether they are not depriving them&s;elves of the benefit of one &s;pecial mean and advantage of improving in know|ledge. And whether, at bottom, this neglect does not
<PB N="ii" REF="011295_0003_0F869EBC627380F8">
proceed from a degree of &s;elf-&s;ufficiency, and from an indifference concerning matters of high importance to be known.</P>
<P>Whether it is not the mo&s;t likely, yea, the only way they can take to know o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> how much importance any controverted point is to them, and to be able to judge on which &s;ide the truth lies, carefully to read the whole controver&s;y.</P>
<P>If any per&s;ons are not competent judges in there things, is it not their own fault for which they have no rea&s;onable excu&s;e? And mu&s;t they not be able to judge for them|&s;elves concerning every truth, in order that it may be of any benefit to them? In this view, is there any real mo|de&s;ty and humility in their neglecting to take all po&s;&s;ible pains to be able to judge for them&s;elves, in matters in which none can judge for them, merely becau&s;e others who have had a reputation for learning and wi&s;dom have differed concerning them; e&s;pecially &s;ince the&s;e things which are hid from the wi&s;e and prudent, are &s;ome times revealed unto babes?</P>
<P>Finally, whether the truth would not greatly &s;uffer, and gro&s;s ignorance univer&s;ally prevail, if every one &s;hould take the &s;ame care to avoid all di&s;putes as they do?</P>
<P>When we con&s;ider of what advantage controver&s;y has already been to truth, and what a tendency it has, in the i&s;&s;ue to e&s;tabli&s;h it, and make it &s;hine more clearly than if no &s;uch controver&s;y had aro&s;e; we &s;hall have rea&s;on to conclude it is GOD'S de&s;ign that every important truth &s;hall be in this way canva&s;&s;ed, and di&s;puted out, as the be&s;t way to have it e&s;tabli&s;hed to the greate&s;t advantage: And that this is one end He de&s;igns to an&s;wer by &s;uffering here&s;ies to ari&s;e, and almo&s;t every truth, in its turn, to be called in que&s;tion and oppo&s;ed. In this view, di&s;putes are &s;o far from being hurtful, and matter of grief, that when they ri&s;e high, and become very common, and gain atten|tion of all, there is ground of encouragement and comfort.</P>
<P>It is to be lamented indeed, that in many in&s;tances con|trover&s;y has been &s;o poorly managed, by which truth has appeared very much to &s;uffer: But even in this ca&s;e, the debate has often been not wholly u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="011295_0003_0F869EBC627380F8">The author i&s; &s;orry that the &s;ide he has taken in the con|trover&s;y before us, has not a more able advocate to defend it, as he doubts not it is capable of a much better defence than he has made. And he is particularly &s;en&s;ible there are many defects in his &s;tyle, which will be di&s;cerned by the reader of a critical ta&s;te; and will call for his candor.</P>
<P>The author thinks he has a claim, on the part of ju&s;tice, to the attention of all tho&s;e who have read Mr. Mills: e&s;pecially of tho&s;e who in reading him have concluded the author has run into very great and hurtful errors. If they have &s;o peremptorily prejudged, as not to be willing to hear the accu&s;ed &s;peak in his own vindication, he thinks he &s;hall have rea&s;on to complain: Not to mention the injury &s;uch men hereby do to them&s;elves, and to the cau&s;e of truth.</P>
<P>It is needle&s;s to tell with what very good views and de&s;igns, and from what excellent, noble motives the author has undertaken this reply; as this would be no great evi|dence in his favour, if any; and it is of very little impor|tance to the reader: his chief concern being to know whe|ther the author has well vindicated the cau&s;e he has under|taken, whatever were his motives.</P>
<P>If the author &amp; the reader &s;hall be found on the right &s;ide of the que&s;tion, and to have taken the pains of writing and reading the en&s;uing reply, from love to Chri&s;t, and zeal in his cau&s;e; they will be richly rewarded for all their labour, and numbered among tho&s;e who follow Chri&s;t when he rides forth conquering and to conquer: And will &s;oon have a happy meeting, and &s;tand before the throne, and before the LAMB, clothed it white robes, and <HI>palms</HI> in their hands; where perfect agreement in &s;entiment, and the mo&s;t exalted friend&s;hip and union of hearts &s;hall reign forever, to the prai&s;e of rich, &s;overeign grace, and honor of the divine, infinitely worthy Redeemer. To HIM be glory forever and ever. AMEN.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>THE que&s;tion particularly &s;tated.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_Mr. MILLS has expre&s;&s;ed what he &s;ays I have a&s;&s;erted, and what he undertakes to oppo&s;e and confute; in the following propo&s;ition.</P>
<P><Q>That on every ri&s;ing degree of internal light, awakening, conviction and amendment of life, found in any of the unregenerate, while &s;uch, they are undoubtedly (on the whole) more vile, odious and abominable in God's &s;ight, than they would have been, had they continued at ea&s;e, going on in their &s;ins, under the &s;ame external means of light.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D. C.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>I would ob&s;erve, in the fir&s;t place, that this propo&s;ition &s;eems hardly intelligible. If by "every ri&s;ing degree of amendment of life," he means every degree of reformation of life, I &s;ee not the connexion this has with "every ri&s;ing degree of internal light, awakening and con|viction," as it &s;tands in the propo&s;ition. Amendment of life may take place, and often does, without any internal light and conviction at all. It often does &s;o by the alteration of a per&s;on's external circum&s;tances; by the removal of the temptation which led to external wickedne&s;s; or by a per&s;wa&s;ion that &s;uch a conduct is hurtful to his worldly intere&s;t, &amp;c. And there may be a degree of awakening and conviction of con|&s;cience, without producing any reformation of life. And where amendment of life does take place in con&s;equence of internal light, &amp;c.
<PB N="2" REF="011295_0005_0F869EC1B38400E8">
the former does not always keep pace exactly with the latter. A &s;mall degree of internal light and conviction of con&s;cience, will often produce a full amendment of life; and after this is effected, and the per&s;on is quite reformed in his external conduct, this internal light and convic|tion may yet increa&s;e, and ri&s;e immen&s;ely higher than that degree which was &s;ufficient for the amendment of life.</P>
<P>Therefore I &s;ay, in the next place, the propo&s;ition is not a true re|pre&s;entation of what I have advanced in my &s;ection on means. Where I &s;peak of the light and conviction of con&s;cience which the awakened &s;inner, has preparatory to regeneration and conver&s;ion, I no where con|fine it to the lowe&s;t degree of this kind, which ever takes place in the mind of a &s;inner; nor to that degree which is barely &s;ufficient for his external reformation. This is not the conviction of which I &s;peak: I &s;peak of an immen&s;ely higher and greater degree of knowledge and conviction than that which is &s;ufficient for this. Mr. M. him&s;elf takes &s;pecial notice of this, in the following words, which &s;tand not &s;ix lines from the propo&s;ition I am con&s;idering. <Q>Nor are the convictions of awakened &s;inners here &s;poken of under any re&s;triction or limitation, but whatever be the degree, 'tho' under the greate&s;t convictions of con&s;cience, and the mo&s;t concern about their &s;ouls,' &amp;c. The au|thor indeed begins with what he calls in&s;truction, explained by &s;peculative knowledge, and then adds what he terms more than &s;peculation, and finally ri&s;es to <HI>all that conviction that the unregenerate are capable of, while &s;uch.</HI></Q> And he expre&s;&s;es this yet more fully in the following words. <Q>The author having rai&s;ed the unregenerate to the <HI>highe&s;t degree</HI> of an awakened &s;en&s;e of divine things, that their &s;tate, as &s;uch, is capable of; every thing, as him&s;elf expre&s;&s;es it, &s;hort of di&s;cerning the true beauty or moral excellency of divine things,' he propo&s;es this query, viz. If it &s;hould be a&s;ked, what good ALL this in&s;truction and knowledge will do the unregenerate, &amp;c. Here it is to be noted, that it is <HI>fully conceded</HI> by the author, that the unregenerate <HI>under con&s;ideration, have</HI> ALL <HI>degrees of light and conviction of divine truth, that can, by a common work of the &s;pirit,</HI> agree to an unregenerate &s;tate.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 54.</NOTE></Q> Here he appears to be &s;en&s;ible enough, that the &s;inners <HI>under con&s;ideration,</HI> have <HI>all degrees of light and conviction,</HI> &amp;c. and takes pains to &s;hew that &s;uch are the &s;inners which I have in view in what I &s;ay. This is indeed very ea&s;ily proved. Had this been in his mind, when he was about forming the propo&s;ition I am, con&s;idering, it ought to have prevented its ever coming into exi&s;tence, as it now &s;tands.</P>
<P>In the paragraph from which Mr. M. quotes the mo&s;t as containing the propo&s;ition he has formed, I repre&s;ent the &s;inner of whom I am &s;peaking, as having a much higher degree of knowledge and convicti|on, than is nece&s;&s;ary barely to produce an external reformation; and as &s;inning again&s;t the light of his con&s;cience in rejecting the go&s;pel, whatever may be his external reformations. That the reader may have
<PB N="3" REF="011295_0005_0F869EC1B38400E8">
it before his eyes, I will tran&s;cribe my words. <Q>The more clearly he &s;ees his own wretched ca&s;e as a &s;inner, and the dreadful con&s;e|quence of dying in his &s;ins; and the clearer conviction he has of his need of a Saviour, and of the truths of the go&s;pel in general; the greater is the crime of his impenitence, and continuing to reject the &s;alvation offered in the go&s;pel. The awakened, <HI>convinced</HI> &s;inner, who has taken a great deal of pains in the u&s;e of means, and has hereby got <HI>a great degree of in&s;truction and knowledge</HI> and yet con|tinues impenitent, is in this re&s;pect much more guilty and vile, and a greater criminal in God's &s;ight, than if he had never attained to this conviction and knowledge: for now he is guilty of the abu&s;e of, and oppo&s;ition to, <HI>all this light and knowledge,</HI> which he could not be, while he had it not<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">p. 129.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Had Mr. M. well attended to this, he mu&s;t have been &s;en&s;ible that the light and conviction of which I &s;peak, as <HI>rendering</HI> the impenitent &s;inner more guilty than when in a &s;tate of ignorance and &s;ecurity, is not the lowe&s;t degree of light and conviction, nor that degree which is only &s;ufficient in &s;ome mea&s;ure to reform a per&s;on's life; and that I affirm nothing particularly of &s;uch a low degree of conviction of con&s;cience which may produce &s;ome degree of reformation, or even wholly reform a per&s;on's external conduct: And therefore that the propo&s;ition is not contained in any thing I &s;ay; but is a gro&s;s mi&s;repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>To &s;et this matter in a yet clearer light, if po&s;&s;ible, I would ob&s;erve; that a per&s;on may be brought to an amendment of life by what is called; by &s;ome at lea&s;t, internal light and conviction of con&s;cience; and yet not have that light and conviction of which I &s;peak. A per&s;on may have only &s;ome imaginary, confu&s;ed notions of a future &s;tate of puni&s;h|ment, and be alarmed and affrighted by apprehen&s;ions of his expo&s;ed|ne&s;s to fall into hell, &amp;c. &s;o as hereby to be led to leave off his vicious cour&s;es: and yet have no ju&s;t &s;peculative notions of God, &s;in or hell. In this ca&s;e, the reformation is not produced by true light and convic|tion of con&s;cience: To be &s;ure, this is not the conviction of which. I am &s;peaking.&mdash;Another per&s;on may reform his life, only under a con|viction that the cour&s;e of wickedne&s;s in which he has lived, leads to hell; without any further conviction with re&s;pect to his &s;in, his lo&s;t &s;tate, his duty, &amp;c. and by &s;uch reformation may make his con&s;cience ea&s;y.&mdash;Another, under a yet further conviction, that &s;omething mu&s;t be done to obtain God's favor, not only reforms all known &s;ins, but betakes him&s;elf to what he thinks duty; and by this gets ea&s;e to his con&s;cience, not imagining <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that his reformations and doings, will make up for his pa&s;t &s;ins, and render him acceptable to God. Whe|ther &s;uch an one; who from a cour&s;e of &s;en&s;uality and debauchery, or any other open wickedne&s;s in which he lived; and had little or no thought of God or a future &s;tate; but only &s;ought the gratification of his reigning pa&s;&s;ions and appetites, becomes &s;erious and regular in his behaviour, and goes into a cour&s;e of &s;trict external religion, with a view
<PB N="4" REF="011295_0006_0F869EC2E7522D68">
to make a righteou&s;ne&s;s of his own, and get to heaven this way: I &s;ay, whether &s;uch an one, by thus turning from one cour&s;e of wicked|ne&s;s to another, does, on the whole, become le&s;s guilty and vile in God's &s;ight, may be a que&s;tion worthy to be attended to.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. M. has him&s;elf an&s;wered this que&s;tion, in repre&s;enting the phari&s;ee who went up to the temple to pray as "one of the vile&s;t &s;in|ners on earth." (p. 80 margin) And I de&s;ire the reader to con&s;ider whether in doing this, he has not implicitly decided the que&s;tion in di&s;pute between us, again&s;t him&s;elf. His vilene&s;s con&s;i&s;ted chiefly in his being ignorant of God's righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;eeking to e&s;tabli&s;h his own righteou&s;ne&s;s: he did not &s;ubmit him&s;elf unto the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God, but oppo&s;ed it with his whole heart. (See Rom. x. 3.) He did this in ignorance and unbelief, and perfectly agreeable to his own judgment and con&s;cience. Every unregenerate &s;inner, under the great|e&s;t awakenings and convictions, does with his whole heart, refu&s;e to &s;ubmit to the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God, and oppo&s;es it, and de&s;ires and attempts to e&s;tabli&s;h his own righteou&s;ne&s;s; and that in direct oppo&s;i|tion, to the dictates of his judgment and con&s;cience. The difference between the&s;e two therefore &s;eems to lie again&s;t the latter, if &s;inning again&s;t the light of con&s;cience, is more vile than living in the &s;ame way of &s;inning ignorantly.</NOTE> But be this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> will, it is not a que&s;tion that I am at pre&s;ent immediately concerned with, as nothing which I have &s;aid about &s;inners under awakenings and convictions of con&s;cience, has any re&s;pect to &s;uch an one; or to any of the in&s;tances which I have now mentioned.</P>
<P>In a word, whatever internal light and conviction of con&s;cience is nece&s;&s;ary to bring a per&s;on to reform his external conduct, and goes no further than this, and ri&s;es no higher; this is not the light and con|viction of which I am &s;peaking. A per&s;on under the influence of &s;uch light and conviction, by thus reforming, may be &s;aid, in a &s;en&s;e, to act up to the light he has, i. e. the light of his con&s;cience, by obeying it and coming up to the dictates of it. As I have &s;aid nothing about &s;uch an in&s;tance, in which reformation ri&s;es in a ju&s;t proportion to the light of con&s;cience, and keeps pace with it, it appears that it is not true that I have a&s;&s;erted, "that on every ri&s;ing degree of internal light, awakening, conviction and amendment of life, the unregenerate are undoubtedly (on the who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e) more vile, &amp;c." I have a right therefore to di&s;own the propo&s;ition Mr. M. has formed for me, as containing what I have not a&s;&s;erted; in which what I have &s;aid is kept quite out of &s;ight, and entirely mi&s;repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>Let it be al&s;o ob&s;erved, that in this propo&s;ition, which is &s;aid to contain the &s;um of what I have advanced on this head, that which I mention as the ground of the greater guilt and criminalne&s;s of the awakened, convinced &s;inner, and that in which it really con&s;i&s;ts, is not mentioned, but kept entirely out of view; which renders it a very partial, unfair &s;tate of the ca&s;e, and tends to give the reader, e&s;pecially
<PB N="5" REF="011295_0006_0F869EC2E7522D68">
one who has never carefully attended to this matter, quite a wrong view of the thing in di&s;pute. I place his greater guilt, not in his awakenings and internal light, nor in his amendment of life; but in his continuing entirely ob&s;tinate and impenitent, under all this light and conviction, and in his oppo&s;ing and rejecting with his whole heart the free offers of pardon and &s;alvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in direct oppo|&s;ition to the clear dictates of his judgment and con&s;cience. This there|fore ought to have been expre&s;&s;ed in a propo&s;ition formed with a pro|fe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign to expre&s;s what I had a&s;&s;erted on this head. As it now &s;tands, there is nothing expre&s;&s;ed as the ground of their being more vile, odious and abominable in God's &s;ight, but "ri&s;ing degrees of internal light, awakening, conviction and amendment of life," which &s;urely is not a fair &s;tate of the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. M. makes the reformation of the convinced &s;inner to keep pace with his light and conviction of con&s;cience. This he does in the pro|po&s;ition in which he attempts to expre&s;s what I have a&s;&s;erted, and every where el&s;e through his whole book.

It is ea&s;y to &s;ee that light and conviction does not aggravate the &s;ins of him who im|mediately comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> with it, and comes up to all the dictates of it per|fectly. The &s;inner I &s;peak of is &s;uppo&s;ed not to comply with the light and conviction he has, but to rebel again&s;t it (which is certainly the ca&s;e of all the unregenerate under true convictions) and in this I placed his greater &s;infulne&s;s. Mr. M. in his propo&s;ition leaves this wholly out; &s;o, in effect, leaves all out that I had a&s;&s;erted; and in|troduces a character about which I had not &s;aid one word, and &s;o makes me a&s;&s;ert what I never did a&s;&s;ert, nor meant to a&s;&s;ert.</P>
<P>I pretend not to charge Mr. M. with thus &s;tating my &s;entiment in a partial, unfair, and wrong light <HI>knowingly</HI> and <HI>upon de&s;ign.</HI> All I am concerned to make out is, that this is in fact the ca&s;e; which I tru&s;t manife&s;tly appears to the impartial reader: And I leave it to him to a&s;&s;ign what rea&s;on he plea&s;es why Mr. M. has &s;tated the matter as he has done. I am willing he him&s;elf &s;hould be believed when he &s;ays he has, "<HI>to the be&s;t of his under&s;tanding,</HI> fairly adju&s;ted, &s;tated, and &s;um'd up the &s;en&s;e of the author."</P>
<P>It may be ob&s;erved that Mr. M. has not only here carefully kept the character which I give of the unregenerate &s;inner under true awak|enings and convictions of con&s;cience, out of view; but has done it thro' his whole performance. And when he has occa&s;ion to quote me where I &s;peak of "the &s;inner's continuing ob&s;tinately to reject and oppo&s;e the &s;alvation offered in the go&s;pel," le&s;t the reader &s;hould be led by the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions to look on the &s;inner in too bad a light, he carefully ob&s;erves that I "mean no more than merely his continuing unregenerate," and nothing but what it con&s;i&s;tent with his reforming

<P>Having &s;hewn that Mr. M's propo&s;ition is &s;o far from "comprizing the plain &s;en&s;e of the author," that it contains what he never a&s;&s;erted, and is a very gro&s;s mi&s;repre&s;entation of the &s;entiment he has e&s;pou&s;ed, &amp; a very unfair &s;tate of the ca&s;e, I will expre&s;s it in my own words; and &s;o as to give what I think is the "plain &s;en&s;e" of what I have &s;aid in my &s;ection on means; and which I yet think is the truth, and may be defended.</P>
<P>The unregenerate &s;inner, who is under genuine and thorough awa|kenings and convictions of con&s;cience re&s;pecting his own &s;tate and cir|cum&s;tances, and the truths of the go&s;pel; particularly, re&s;pecting this truth, that &s;alvation is freely offered to him through a Mediator, which he is obliged by the &s;tronge&s;t ties of duty and intere&s;t immediately to accept and embrace; being at the &s;ame time wholly without any excu&s;e for his neglect in not embracing it, and for the oppo&s;ition of his heart to Chri&s;t, of which he is con&s;cious; and who yet continues, under all this light, and contrary to the plain dictates and pre&s;&s;ing, painful convictions of his own con&s;cience, ob&s;tinately to oppo&s;e and reject Je&s;us Chri&s;t: &s;uch an one is, on the account of this his impe|nitence and ob&s;tinacy under this clear light and conviction of con&s;ci|ence, more guilty, vile and odious in God's &s;ight, than he was before he had this light and conviction, and was in a &s;tate of &s;ecurity and ignorance; whatever alteration or reformation has taken place in him in other re&s;pects.</P>
<P>To prevent mi&s;under&s;tanding, it is needful to ob&s;erve here, that in this propo&s;ition, and in all that I have &s;aid on this head in my &s;ection on means, nothing is affirmed of a &s;inner who has lo&s;t his convictions which he was under for a while, and has returned in a great degree to &s;ecurity and ea&s;e, and to the allowed commi&s;&s;ion of the gro&s;s external wickedne&s;s, which he had for&s;ook under the influence of the light and conviction which he had: or to that which is more gro&s;s and vile: I &s;ay, nothing is affirmed of &s;uch an one, whether he is now more or le&s;s guilty and vile than he was when under conviction, and when external|ly reformed. All that is affirmed is, that the &s;inner under the awaken|ings and convictions de&s;cribed, is more guilty than he was in a &s;tate of ignorance and &s;ecurity antecedent to luck convictions, of which he never was the &s;ubject before. Mr. M. has made this mi&s;take, and
<PB N="7" REF="011295_0007_0F869EC3D2567D10">
not di&s;tingui&s;hed between the&s;e two ca&s;es, as I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve in the &s;equel. The &s;inner I de&s;cribe may be much more guilty and vile under awakenings and convictions, than he was before; and yet may be more guilty &s;till, on the whole, by oppo&s;|ing and &s;uppre&s;&s;ing his convictions, and, as it were, doing violence to his con&s;cience, by de&s;ignedly taking tho&s;e mea&s;ures, and going into tho&s;e ways of gro&s;s, outward wickedne&s;s, which by degrees wear off the conviction which gave him unea&s;ine&s;s. This is a ca&s;e to which nothing I have &s;aid has any re&s;pect.</P>
<P>I would not be here under&s;tood, however, to intimate, that the awakened, convinced &s;inner does not always oppo&s;e his convictions; tho' not always in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e and degree as ju&s;t now mentioned. Convictions may be oppo&s;ed two ways, and in two &s;en&s;es. They are truly oppo&s;ed when the truths of which the &s;inner is convinced are di&s;agreeable to his heart, and he refu&s;es cordially to &s;ubmit to them, and comply with them. In this &s;en&s;e unregenerate &s;inners always re&s;i&s;t all their convictions, and oppo&s;e them with their whole hearts, however de&s;irous they may be to have their convictions continue, and whatever pains they may take in the u&s;e of means to maintain and cheri&s;h them, becau&s;e they believe that they are nece&s;&s;ary in order to e&s;cape hell, and be &s;aved, and that it is mo&s;t dangerous to lo&s;e their convictions, and return to ea&s;e and &s;ecurity. In this &s;en&s;e they may "nouri&s;h their convictions," agreeable to Mr. M's phra&s;e, and yet oppo&s;e all the truths they are convinced of, with their whole hearts, and remain mo&s;t ob&s;tinate enemies to Chri&s;t, and the way of &s;alvation by him. But &s;inners may al&s;o re&s;i&s;t convictions, and often do, by trying to get rid of them, and taking mea&s;ures with a de&s;ign to wear them off from their minds: And many times they in this way &s;till their con&s;ciences, get ea&s;e, and return to their former cour&s;es, or to cour&s;es &s;till wor&s;e. Of &s;uch nothing is affirmed or denied in the pro|po&s;ition in di&s;pute between Mr. M. and me.</P>
<P>Let it al&s;o be noted here, that if two per&s;ons have equal degrees of light and conviction of con&s;cience; and one reforms his external con|duct, and attends on means under the influence of the conviction he has; and the other goes on in his allowed external wickedne&s;s, in neglect of all means; and this ever was, or can be the ca&s;e; nothing is &s;aid of &s;uch a ca&s;e in the propo&s;ition. Indeed, nothing is &s;aid of <HI>different</HI> per&s;ons, whether one is more guilty and vile than another <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> but what is affirmed is of the <HI>&s;ame</HI> per&s;on, who is now awakened from a &s;tate of ea&s;e and &s;ecurity, and has that light and conviction con|&s;cience which he never had before, and which is incon&s;i&s;tent with a &s;tate of &s;ecurity and open wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>It will be ob&s;erved that in this propo&s;ition it is a&s;&s;erted that this it true <HI>in all ca&s;es;</HI> however vicious and guilty the per&s;on was while ig|norant and &s;tupid, and in a &s;tate of &s;ecurity and carnal ea&s;e; yet by continuing impenitent under the awakenings and convictions mention|ed he, becomes a greater criminal, is guilty of more aggravated wick|edne&s;s
<PB N="8" REF="011295_0008_0F869EC4387B6190">
than he was before, whatever particular ways of &s;inning he has for&s;aken, in which he before lived.</P>
<P>This, I am &s;en&s;ible, will be thought by many to be carrying the matter to a great length, and even too far. If it had been only &s;aid, that many, if not mo&s;t unregenerate &s;inners, who have not been guilty of any enormous crimes and uncommon wickedne&s;s in their lives, do become more guilty when their con&s;ciences are thoroughly awakened and convinced, than they were in a &s;tate of &s;ecurity; they perhaps think this is true, and may be ea&s;ily proved. But to carry the matter &s;o far, even to every in&s;tance without exception, they think is not &s;afe, and perhaps is not true; and if it is true, it is a matter of no great importance, and it may be difficult to prove it. And it will give tho&s;e who are di&s;po&s;ed to oppo&s;e the real truth in this ca&s;e, an advantage again&s;t it, and an opportunity greatly to prejudice others again&s;t in, who would probably have fallen in with it, had it not been a&s;&s;erted it &s;uch <HI>univer&s;al</HI> terms.</P>
<P>It is certain that Mr. M. has taken all the advantage he could of this (and as has been &s;hewn, more than he could fairly do, by mi&s;repre&s;ent|ing the matter, and carrying it further than I had done.) He has not failed to keep this in view every where, as if it was the only point of controver&s;y between him and me. Whereas this is not true; for he through his whole book as much oppo&s;es the notion of &s;inners in ge|neral growing wor&s;e under awakenings and convictions of con&s;cience, or that this is true in any in&s;tance, as he does that this is the ca&s;e in <HI>every</HI> in&s;tance: And he has &s;aid nothing to prove the latter not true, which is not equally again&s;t the former. Therefore if I &s;hould now give up this point, that &s;inners under genuine, thorough convictions are in <HI>all ca&s;es</HI> more criminal and vile in God's &s;ight, than they were in a &s;tate of ignorance and &s;ecurity, however criminal and vile they were then; and only a&s;&s;ert that this is the ca&s;e with unregenerate &s;in|ners in general who have lived pretty regular lives in a &s;tate of &s;ecurity, Mr. M. would have as real a controver&s;y with me then, as he has now, as his whole book is as much again&s;t the latter as the former. This, I tru&s;t, will fully appear before I have done.</P>
<P>But as I yet think this propo&s;ition is true, as I have now &s;tated it, and may be made evident beyond all doubt to tho&s;e who will be im|partial, and will thoroughly con&s;ider the matter, I &s;hall attempt to prove it, and leave it to the reader to judge for him&s;elf. But if, after all, any &s;hould think it is not proved beyond all controver&s;y that the unregenerate in the ca&s;e propo&s;ed are in <HI>all in&s;tances</HI> more vile, &amp;c. tho' it be quite evident that this is true of &s;inners in general: and that it is of no importance that the propo&s;ition &s;hould be affirmed without any exception; let it be remembered that tho' I think the former to be both an evident and important truth; yet the latter is much more important. And if Mr. M. had not oppo&s;ed the latter as much as the former, perhaps I &s;hould not have thought it worth while to make any reply.</P>

But before I proceed to this argument, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to con|&s;ider what is the true &s;tate and character of the unregenerate &s;inner under awakenings and under the mo&s;t clear convictions of con&s;cience. This will therefore be attended to in the next &s;ection.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The true &s;tate and character of the unregenerate &s;inner under awakenings and convictions con&s;idered and &s;tated, in oppo&s;ition to the character which Mr. Mills gives of &s;uch.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE unregenerate &s;inner is an enemy to God. The whole bent, and all the exerci&s;es of his heart, are in oppo&s;ition to God's true character; and no influences on his mind, whether by the &s;pirit of God, or any thing el&s;e, antecedent to regeneration, or any change what&s;oever, do in the lea&s;t degree remove this oppo&s;ition and enmity. For he is &s;till under the dominion of &s;in, having not the lea&s;t degree of right di&s;po&s;ition, and exerci&s;e of true love to God and man. And whatever awakenings of con&s;cience &amp; convictions of the truth take place in the &s;inners mind; and however di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and anxious he is about his ca&s;e, and whatever alteration there is in his conduct produced by fear or hope; &s;till he is as real and as great an enemy to the divine character, to the law of God, to Je&s;us Chri&s;t and the go&s;pel, as ever. Whatever are the influences of the &s;pirit of God on the mind of an unregenerate &s;inner, in awakenings and convictions of con&s;cience they make no alteration as to the prevailing temper and inclination of the heart. No new di&s;po&s;ition and principles of heart are given, nor are the natural, corrupt principles of the heart in the lea&s;t altered for the better, &s;o as to be more friendly, or le&s;s oppo&s;ite to God. Therefore all the exertions and exerci&s;es of the heart, under the greate&s;t degree of this influence, by which the con&s;cience is inlightened and awakened, are no more friendly to God, but as corrupt and as oppo&s;ite to him as ever.</P>
<P>This mu&s;t be &s;o: for the corrupt principles of the heart exerci&s;ed and acted out will always be the &s;ame, whatever light and conviction is in the judgment and con&s;cience. The corrupt tree will bring forth cor|rupt fruit; and that which is born of the fle&s;h is, and will be fle&s;h. Every exerci&s;e of an entire enemy to God, will be of the nature of en|mity again&s;t him. And there is no other way to &s;uppre&s;s and put an end to tho&s;e corrupt, &s;inful exerci&s;es but either to change his heart, or to put an end to all his exerci&s;es, by ca&s;ting him into a deep &s;leep, by turning him into a bea&s;t, tree or rock, or by annihiliation. Many have talked of the unregenerate &s;inner's for&s;aking &s;in and doing his duty, upon mere <HI>natural</HI> principles: But what do they mean? What natural
<PB N="10" REF="011295_0009_0F869EC5286A8AD8">
principles are there, but corrupt principles? If they &s;ay <HI>natural con|&s;cience</HI> is a natural principle, and not corrupt, e&s;pecially when inlight|ened by the &s;pirit of God; I an&s;wer, Natural con&s;cience, &s;o far as it is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the heart, is no principle of action at all. The heart is the &s;ource and &s;eat of all moral exerci&s;e and action; natural con|&s;cience therefore, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from this, is neither &s;inful nor virtuous. they &s;hall &s;ay <HI>fear</HI> and <HI>hope</HI> are natural principles; I grant they are common to angels and men, &s;aints and &s;inners; but in the unregenerate have no more real goodne&s;s in them, than the &s;ame principles in the devils them&s;elves. Fear and hope are as much concerned in the wor&s;t of exerci&s;es and actions, and have as much influence in them, as in the be&s;t. And the exerci&s;es of fear and hope are ju&s;t as corrupt and &s;inful, as is the heart in which they are exerci&s;ed. If they &s;ay <HI>&s;elf love</HI> is a natural principle from which the unregenerate do avoid &s;in and in many ca&s;es perform their duty; I an&s;wer, If by &s;elf love is meant only a de&s;ire and love of happine&s;s in general, and aver&s;ion to mi&s;ery or evil; this is in it&s;elf neither more nor le&s;s &s;inful or virtuous, but may be con&s;idered as the principle of all exerci&s;es and actions, both good and bad, and has as much concern and influence in the wor&s;t, as in the be&s;t. But if by a principle of &s;elf love is meant <HI>&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s,</HI> or a per&s;on's &s;elfi&s;h regard and re&s;pect to him&s;elf, his own private, &s;eperate intere&s;t and happine&s;s, without any di&s;intere&s;ted regard to any other being, always &s;eeking and pur&s;uing that which appears to him for his own good; being wholly influenced by this, and nothing el&s;e, in all his exerci&s;es and conduct; this is it&s;elf &s;inful, and is the principle and &s;ource of all the &s;in in the univer&s;e, being directly oppo&s;ite to true benevolence, which it the &s;um of all that is truly good; this is in its own nature enmity to being in general; and is that by which man be|comes an enemy to God and man. So far therefore as men act from this principle, they &s;in; and they are &s;inful in proportion to the &s;trength and vigor with which this principle is exerted. If a per&s;on is wholly under the government of this &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, loving and regarding him&s;elf &s;upre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ly, and having no re&s;pect and regard to God or man, only from &s;elfi&s;h ends, and as the fruit and exerci&s;e of this &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s: I &s;ay if a per&s;on is wholly under the dominion of this &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, as all the unregene|rate are, all his actions are wrong and &s;inful, in whatever way he &s;eeks his own happine&s;s; whether in a worldly intere&s;t, in pur&s;uing the profits, honors or plea&s;ures of this world; or in the happine&s;s of the future &s;tate, earne&s;tly pur&s;uing it, in cro&s;&s;ing his &s;en&s;ual appetites, and in the painful exerci&s;e of what be calls devotion and religion. Oppo&s;ition and enmity to God and his law, and so to Chri&s;t and the go&s;pel, may be as really exerci&s;ed in the latter way as the former, and in as high a degree; yea, much higher and more immediately and directly again&s;t God. But of this more particularly hereafter.</P>
<P>It hence appears that whatever influence there is on the natural prin|ciples of the &s;oul by the &s;pirit of God, in awakenings, conviction of con&s;cience, &amp;c. this does not at all abate the power of wickedne&s;s in the
<PB N="11" REF="011295_0009_0F869EC5286A8AD8">
heart. Self-love, or &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, into whatever channel it is turned; whether it is exerci&s;ed about pre&s;ent or future good, in fears of evil, or hopes of good in this world, or the world to come, and earne&s;t at|tempts to obtain the good and e&s;cape the evil: I &s;ay this <HI>&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s</HI> is &s;till of the &s;ame nature, and it is in direct oppo&s;ition to all true goodne&s;s. The greate&s;t awakenings and convictions of con&s;cience, and every thing that takes place in con&s;equence of this in the minds of the unre|generate, do not in any degree abate the exerci&s;e of this grand prin|ciple of all &s;in and rebellion in the univer&s;e; &s;o do not make the heart in any degree better; but may be the occa&s;ion of turning the &s;elfi&s;h rebellious heart more directly and in a much &s;tronger degree of exer|ci&s;e again&s;t God; and perhaps always has this effect. But this is to be con&s;idered in the next &s;ection.</P>
<P>I particularly ob&s;erve this to &s;hew the mi&s;take which &s;ome make in this matter. Becau&s;e awakenings and convictions of con&s;cience are effected by the &s;pirit of God, they think that &s;omething good, or le&s;s &s;inful in the heart mu&s;t be the effect of this work of the &s;pirit. There is no ground for &s;uch a con&s;equence. There is nothing done in the inlightening and conviction of the con&s;ciences of the unregenerate, and awakening them to attend to the truth, &amp;c. which will not be done in a much higher degree, tho' not ju&s;t in the &s;ame way, in the minds of the wicked at the day of judgment, and forever afterwards. But who will &s;ay, the wicked then, under all their convictions, fears and horrors, will not be as rebellious, impenitent and hardened, as the &s;ecure &s;inner is, who neither knows nor fears any of the&s;e things?</P>
<P>If any &s;hould &s;ay, 'there is this grand difference, between an awa|kened, convinced &s;inner in this world, and the convictions and horrors of the wicked at the day of judgment, that the former is under hope, and has the offer of mercy and &s;alvation; but the latter will be in ab&s;olute di&s;pair: the hope of the former leads him to dread &s;in and &s;eek deliverance in the u&s;e of means, &amp;c.' It is granted this is true Self-love or &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s will exerci&s;e it&s;elf in this way in the&s;e circum|stances; but &s;till this is nothing but &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s under the influence of fear of evil and hope of e&s;cape, and of obtaining happine&s;s; the heart is no more truly pliable, obedient and penitent than ever, does not comply in the lea&s;t degree, but ob&s;tinately oppo&s;es God and the go&s;pel. And as he does mo&s;t ob&s;tinately re&s;i&s;t and trample under his feet the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing mercy, which is freely offered to him, and reject the Son of God in all his amazing conde&s;cention and grace; in this view, his impenitence, hardne&s;s of heart and ob&s;tinacy, appear in a mo&s;t &s;triking, awful light, and much more aggravated and &s;hocking than that of the latter.</P>
<P>The unregenerate &s;inner is therefore a hardned, impenitent rebel, who with his whole heart oppo&s;es and hates God, and his holy law, and hates and rejects Je&s;us Chri&s;t and the &s;alvation offered by him, &s;o far as the&s;e come into his view, and under his notice. He is so, under all the awakenings, convictions and reformations that he is the &s;ubject
<PB N="12" REF="011295_0010_0F869ECA8DECD1C0">
of. Whatever it done to him, and what changes &s;oever he pa&s;&s;es through, his character with re&s;pect to the&s;e things is not altered; he is yet as really under the dominion of &s;in, and a fixed, impenitent, ob|&s;tinate enemy to God and Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as ever.</P>
<P>The awakened &s;inner under all his convictions, terrors and refor|mations, and mo&s;t earne&s;t attempts to e&s;cape the evil he &s;ees him&s;elf in danger of, and obtain &s;alvation, has no more love and re&s;pect to God than he ever had, and is really as much under the power of oppo&s;ite principles as ever, as has been ob&s;erved; does not hate &s;in, at all, but is as much in love with it as ever.</P>
<P>Many a profligate wretch, who has long indulged him&s;elf in un|cleanne&s;s and debauchery, when he has been brought into &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances that his wickedne&s;s is like to be di&s;covered, &s;o as to bring di&s;grace and contempt upon him, and ruin him in all his worldly intere&s;ts; has been filled with anxiety and di&s;tre&s;s, &s;o that he could find no quiet, night nor day: he has been convinced of his folly, condemned him&s;elf, and reformed his vile practices, being afraid to indulge him&s;elf in the lea&s;t degree, as he had done, and re&s;olved that he would carefully avoid &s;uch conduct for time to come: and has u&s;ed unwearied attempts to e&s;cape the evil he feared. And in this time of his fear and di&s;tre&s;s has made many prayers to God, hoping that he would interpo&s;e in his behalf, &s;o that he might e&s;cape the evil he feared. But when his fears were over, and nothing was, in his view, in the way of his going into his former practices without danger of puni&s;hment or a di&s;covery, he has returned to them with as much de|light and eagerne&s;s as ever. In this ca&s;e every one will be &s;en&s;ible how little in his favor was his reformation, and that under all his fears and terrors, and earne&s;t endeavours to avoid evil, his heart was really no better than it was before, and was as much in love with &s;in. This may in &s;ome mea&s;ure illu&s;trate the ca&s;e of the awakened &s;inner, with re&s;pect to what I have ju&s;t now been &s;peaking. For there is no more virtue and goodne&s;s in fearing evil in the future world, even the puni&s;h|ment of hell, than worldly evil; and the reformation of any particular practices from &s;uch fear, is from no better principles, and no more an evidence of real oppo&s;ition of heart to &s;in, than in the in&s;tance ju&s;t mentioned.</P>
<P>The highway robber, who is apprehended and condemned to be hanged, and is hereby thrown into great di&s;tre&s;s of mind, and mo&s;t earne&s;tly petitions the king for mercy, and promi&s;es reformation and obedience to his laws for time to come, will, as &s;oon as he is &s;et at liberty, and has no fear of being again apprehended, di&s;mi&s;s all his fear, and return to the &s;ame cour&s;e again. Will he who views him in this light, in the time of his fears, reformations and promi&s;es, look upon him to be really more penitent, or le&s;s an enemy to his king and country, than before he was apprehended? In no better light the un|regenerate &s;inner ought to be viewed, under all his awakenings, and convictions of con&s;cience.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="011295_0010_0F869ECA8DECD1C0">
It hence appears that the awakened, convinced &s;inner does not, while unregenerate, really yield or give up one point of controver&s;y between him and his Maker, but is as impenitent and ob&s;tinate as ever, being &s;till as great a friend to &s;in, and enemy to God as he was before; the principles and exerci&s;es of his heart being not in the lea&s;t abated with re&s;pect to this.</P>
<P>AND it is of great importance to be ob&s;erved here, and well attended to, that the unregenerate &s;inner <HI>is wholly to blame</HI> for all that in which his unregeneracy con&s;i&s;ts, it being nothing but wickedne&s;s and rebel|lion of heart, for which the &s;inner has not the lea&s;t imaginable excu&s;e. He is under no kind or degree of impotency or difficulty, which is in the way of his repentance, loving God, and embracing the go&s;pel, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the lea&s;t excu&s;e for not doing it, or takes off the lea&s;t degree of blame for his neglect. He is under no kind of inability or difficulty that is in the way of his turning to God immediately, which the open profligate is not under, as a bar in the way of his reforming his wicked conduct immediately. In the latter ca&s;e all the difficulty lies in the corruption of his heart, and the oppo&s;ition of his will to it: and this is all the difficulty in the former. And if it is more difficult for a &s;in|ner to turn to God thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t with his whole heart, than it is for him to for&s;ake all ways of known &s;in in external conduct, and he is under a greater inability to do the former than the latter, it is wholly becau&s;e his will oppo&s;es the former more than it does the latter, or rather becau&s;e the latter may be complied with con&s;i&s;tent with the indulgence of the reigning wickedne&s;s of the heart, and enmity again&s;t God, whereas the former cannot. The rea&s;on why the open profligate does not reform his conduct immediately is becau&s;e he is not willing, or his heart oppo&s;es this. And the only rea&s;on why the awakened, convinced &s;inner does not embrace the go&s;pel immediately, but remains ob&s;tinately impenitent, is becau&s;e his will, even his whole heart oppo&s;es it. All the difference is, that in the latter ca&s;e the oppo&s;ition of the heart to Je&s;us Chri&s;t is more fixed and &s;trong, than it is in the former <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;e to an external reformation, as an external reformation may be com|plied with, con&s;i&s;tent with the exerci&s;e and gratification of the reigning lu&s;ts of the heart: but compliance with the go&s;pel cannot. And is there need of &s;aying any thing to prove that the &s;inner is perfectly in|excu&s;able and to blame for not doing that in which there is no difficulty but what con&s;i&s;ts in the want of a will or heart, and the oppo&s;ition of the will to it? This would be the &s;ame thing as to undertake to prove that wickedne&s;s of heart, and that in which all &s;in and blame do con&s;i&s;t, is indeed wickedne&s;s, &s;inful and blameworthy. And if oppo&s;ition of heart to that which is in it&s;elf right, is, in all ca&s;es, &s;inful, and perfectly inexcu&s;able and blameworthy; then the greater is the degree of this oppo&s;ition and the more &s;trong, fixed and perfect it is, the further is the &s;inner from all excu&s;e, and the more blameworthy. So that the diffi|culty and inability of loving God and embracing the go&s;pel in the ca&s;e before us, is &s;o far from rendering the &s;inner in any degree blamele&s;s or excu&s;able, that the more there is of this, the more blameworthy and criminal he is.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="011295_0011_0F869ECBBA20DC00">
Hence it appears that the unregenerate &s;inner's reigning oppo&s;ition and enmity of heart again&s;t God and the go&s;pel, is perfectly criminal and mo&s;t odious and abominable in his &s;ight, notwith&s;tanding all his awakenings, convictions and external reformations; the latter do not render the former a whit the le&s;s criminal, odious and abominable; any more than the clean&s;ing and &s;couring the out&s;ide of a cup renders the mo&s;t offen&s;ive, abominable corruption and filthine&s;s, of which it is within full, le&s;s odious and abominable. Or (to u&s;e another compari|&s;on) no more than the cryings of a &s;tubborn child, in dread of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">od, which is held over him, and his &s;trivings to get out of his father's hands and e&s;cape, &s;erve to extenuate his crime, while he ob&s;tinately refu&s;es to own his fault and &s;ubmit to his father's will; and re&s;olutely oppo&s;es him under all his threatnings.</P>
<P>THE unregenerate &s;inner has no <HI>&s;incere de&s;ires</HI> to repent and embrace the go&s;pel, or of a new heart: It is the mo&s;t glaring contradiction to &s;uppo&s;e he has; as great a one as to &s;uppo&s;e, that wickedne&s;s is friendly to holine&s;s. The&s;e things are not the objects of the de&s;ires of the hearts of the unregenerates, but of their aver&s;ion and enmity. They de&s;ire deliverance from mi&s;ery, and the enjoyment of happine&s;s (tho' not true happine&s;s and the &s;alvation, which the go&s;pel offers) under a conviction that they mu&s;t repent and &s;ubmit to Chri&s;t, in order to e&s;cape the one, and obtain the other: But their hearts are as far from de&s;iring to re|pent and turn to God, as ever; for if they had a real de&s;ire to repent, &amp;c. they would repent; for nothing is in the way of this, but oppo&s;iti|on of heart. And they make no <HI>&s;incere attempts</HI> to turn to God and embrace the go&s;pel; for this would &s;uppo&s;e their hearts did not wholly oppo&s;e the&s;e, which they do, as has been &s;hewn; and the whole diffi|culty of their turning to God, and the only rea&s;on of their not doing it immediately, lies in this enmity and oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>If any are di&s;po&s;ed to look on the awakened &s;inner, as le&s;s to blame for his enmity of heart again&s;t God, and fixed, ob&s;tinate oppo&s;ition to Chri&s;t, becau&s;e he is externally reformed, and greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, under fears that he &s;hall be mi&s;erable forever; and if &s;uch appear in a great degree harmle&s;s and innocent in their &s;ight, they certainly judge in this ca&s;e according to the outward appearance, and not righteous judg|ment. In God's &s;ight all that wickedne&s;s of heart in which their un|regeneracy con&s;i&s;ts, and in which they continue wholly impenitent, and enemies to the divine character and the go&s;pel, is perfectly inex|cu&s;able and criminal, and infinitely odious; there being no difficulty in their becoming friends to God, &amp;c. but what lies in the voluntary wickedne&s;s of their hearts.</P>
<P>MANY have made a very great and hurtful mi&s;take here. They repre&s;ent the impotency of the unregenerate to turn to God and believe in Chri&s;t to be &s;uch as not to be altogether blameable, if criminal in any degree. They are to blame, wholly to blame, they allow, for not doing <HI>what they can do,</HI> as they are won<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> expre&s;s it; but if they reform, and do <HI>what they can,</HI> and cry to God to change their hearts,

&amp;c. they are poor creatures, to be pitied that they are in &s;uch a &s;ad ca&s;e; but not much, if at all to blame, for remaining under the do|minion of &s;in, and not embracing the go&s;pel, which they are de&s;iring and hone&s;tly attempting, but have no power to do it: &s;o that this is rather their calamity, than their &s;in.</P>
<P>THIS way of repre&s;enting the matter has been infinitely mi&s;chievous.&mdash;By thus mi&s;repre&s;enting the doctrine of man's natural impotency, they have rendered it ridiculous to tho&s;e, who have been di&s;po&s;ed to oppo&s;e the real truth, and have prejudiced them again&s;t it. While they them&s;elves have been unable to defend the doctrine in the light, in which they &s;et it; and &s;o have given occa&s;ion to the enemies of the truth to triumph.&mdash;On the other hand, it has proved an agreeable re|fuge and &s;weet re&s;ting place to multitudes. By this repre&s;entation they have been "&s;ewing pillows to all arm-holes,"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xiii. 18.</NOTE> and comforting tho&s;e, to whom God &s;peaks no peace. The unregenerate &s;inner, who has reformed all ways of external &s;in, and allows him&s;elf in no known outward evil practices, and prays to God for a new heart, &amp;c. which he thinks he &s;incerely de&s;ires, but that it is wholly out of his power to change his own heart: Such an one, I &s;ay, makes him&s;elf in a great mea&s;ure ea&s;y in an unregenerate &s;tate, while he thinks he does all he can. Such a &s;inner is not under genuine, thorough convictions; and never will, nor po&s;&s;ibly can be, while he believes this repre&s;entation to be ju&s;t.</P>
<P>AND this doctrine of man's inability, as con&s;i&s;ting in &s;omething, which does in &s;ome mea&s;ure excu&s;e, and is con&s;i&s;tent with a per&s;on's &s;incere de&s;ires of heart to have it removed, and to do what he <HI>cannot</HI> do: This doctrine, I &s;ay, is mo&s;t &s;weet to many a corrupt heart. Many profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians fly to this refuge to hide and re&s;t them&s;elves, by making it an excu&s;e for their not living in con&s;tant and high exerci&s;es of chri&s;tian holine&s;s. They &s;ay, "We are poor creatures, we can do nothing of our&s;elves; if God does not a&s;&s;i&s;t us and give us &s;trength, we can do nothing, we have no power of our own, &amp;c." And if they are told the truth of the matter; that they are under no inability but what con&s;i&s;ts in their inexcu&s;able, voluntary wickedne&s;s: that they are wholly to blame for all their defects, &amp;c. they will oppo&s;e it with all their might, as what tends to take away their comfort, and rob them of their only refuge. For this doctrine of man's inability, as con&s;i&s;ting in &s;ome difficulty in the way of holine&s;s, which is independent of the will, and for which they are not wholly to blame, is as agreeable to the corrupt heart of man, as any Arminian or Pelagian doctrine what&s;oever can be. How many of tho&s;e who are called Calvini&s;ts have fled to this refuge of lies, and here are like to peri&s;h, God knows!&mdash;Be this as it will, it certainly becomes all the friends of truth, and of mankind to do all they can, effectually to expo&s;e this un&s;criptural, ab&s;urd, dan|gerous notion; and &s;et the truth in a clear light.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This I took pains to do in my remarks on Dr. Mayhew's &s;ermons<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">P. 99, &amp;c.</NOTE> Mr. M. has approved of all this and yet builds all his oppo&s;ition to me on that which is in direct contradiction to it, as will be &s;een in the &s;equel.</NOTE></P>

Mr. MILLS has, I think, unhappily fallen into this &s;ad and dangerous mi&s;take; which is di&s;covered through the whole of his performance, as that on which he grounds all his oppo&s;ition to me.</P>
<P>He has not &s;aid one word, that I have ob&s;erved, from beginning to end, of the convinced &s;inner's enmity again&s;t God, and ob&s;tinate rejec|tion of Chri&s;t and the go&s;pel, being under the dominion of a hard, impenitent heart. All this is carefully kept out of &s;ight; unle&s;s when he was obliged to mention &s;omething of it in his quotations from me. And in this ca&s;e he always puts in a caveat, ob&s;erving that I mean no more by the&s;e hard terms than <HI>merely continuing unregenerate.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 3, 15, 56.</NOTE> Plainly intimating that he thinks &s;uch terms do not properly belong to the unregenerate as &s;uch, and that they repre&s;ent them as wor&s;e and more criminal than they really are. He therefore every where &s;peaks of the unawakened &s;inner as impenitent, hardened and &s;tout-hearted, in op|po&s;ition to one that is awakened, as if this was not true of the latter, and as if the latter was of an oppo&s;ite character.</P>
<P>And he repre&s;ents the unregenerate as not wholly to blame for their unregeneracy, their unbelief and not embracing the go&s;pel; but as being under an impotence which does in &s;ome mea&s;ure, if not wholly excu&s;e. This repre&s;entation runs through his whole book, as has been ju&s;t now ob&s;erved, and is laid as the foundation of all his oppo&s;ition to me. This I conclude will be quite evident to every attentive reader, before I &s;hall have done. I &s;hall now cite only a few expre&s;&s;ions of his, which &s;eem to &s;et the matter in this light, e&s;pecially if con&s;idered in connection with others, which I am about to mention.

<P>This is the account Mr. M. gives of unregenerate &s;inners under awakening and convictions! And he has &s;aid not only this, but much more in their favour; too much to be tran&s;cribed here. Upon which I &s;hall make the following remarks.</P>
<P N="1">1. If this repre&s;entation of the unregenerate &s;inner under convictions is agreeable to the truth; then all that I have &s;aid of &s;uch in my &s;ec|tion on means, is wrong and groundle&s;s; and &s;uch an one is not only le&s;s vile than the profligate; but is in a great degree innocent and blamele&s;s. He does not &s;in again&s;t the light of his con&s;cience, or abu&s;e it in the lea&s;t; for he reverences his con&s;cience, and lives up to the dictates of it, avoiding every known &s;in and coming up to all known duty. He is not properly an <HI>impenitent &s;inner;</HI> for he does really
<PB N="18" REF="011295_0013_0F869ECD3AFD49B0">
repent and humble him&s;elf before God. Nor does he ob&s;tinately reject Je&s;us Chri&s;t and the go&s;pel; for, on the whole, he de&s;ires the &s;alvation which is offered in the go&s;pel, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">es to &s;overeign mercy, there held out to him, as his only refuge. As I placed the great guilt and vilene&s;s of the unregenerate &s;inner in his &s;inning again&s;t the light and convictions of his own con&s;cience, in ob&s;tinately refu&s;ing the offers of the go&s;pel and rejecting Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which he is now convinced he is wholly to blame for, and is the greate&s;t &s;in he ever was guilty of; I own my charge is quite groundle&s;s and very injurious if Mr. M. has given a ju&s;t and true character of the unregenerate: and I mu&s;t yield the point to him.</P>
<P>But if all he has &s;aid on this head, is a gro&s;s mi&s;repre&s;entation of the character of the unregenerate &s;inner, and he applies to them many things which are found in the regenerate only; and if mo&s;t of his arguments, and the plau&s;iblene&s;s of all he has &s;aid, are founded in this mi&s;repre&s;entation; then all is built on a very &s;lender foundation, and really comes to nothing. And I think I have a right to call this a <HI>mi&s;repre&s;entation,</HI> as I cannot find that Mr. M. has attempted to prove the&s;e things; but has taken them for granted, and only a&s;&s;erted them. And I think what has been &s;aid in this &s;ection is &s;ufficient to &s;hew that Mr. M's account of the unregenerate is very gro&s;sly wrong. And this will more fully appear, I tru&s;t, before I have done.</P>
<P N="2">2. If Mr. M. has given a ju&s;t character of the unregenerate; then what I have &s;aid of the&s;e in my di&s;pute with Dr. Mayhew, on which I founded all my oppo&s;ition to him, is wholly wrong. For the whole di&s;pute turned upon this que&s;tion, Whether unregenerate &s;inners do, on the whole, really de&s;ire the &s;alvation offered in the go&s;pel? I a&s;|&s;erted that they do not, and undertook to prove it, and owned that if the Dr. would prove that they do, he would gain his point, and I was ready to yield it to him. Mr. M. has really taken the Dr's &s;ide in this controver&s;y, and repre&s;ented the unregenerate &s;inner in as blamele&s;s and fair a light as he did, and has rai&s;ed him as high; yea, has &s;aid much more in his favour.</P>
<P>And is it not &s;trange, that this &s;ame Mr. M. &s;hould give me his "<HI>hearty</HI> thanks" for what I had wrote again&s;t the Dr. and call it "a fini&s;hed debate on the point!"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Preface P. 5.</NOTE> Surely Mr. M. is far from under|&s;tanding the debate between the Dr. and me; and &s;o was very unfit to pronounce any thing about it: or he is very incon&s;i&s;tent with him|&s;elf. Both are perhaps true.</P>
<P N="3">3. What is &s;till more &s;trange and incon&s;i&s;tent, if po&s;&s;ible, is his ap|plying promi&s;es to the doings of the unregenerate, or repre&s;enting them as coming up to that, to which promi&s;es are expre&s;sly made. This appears from what has been ju&s;t quoted from him. He applies the following words to the unregenerate, "Then &s;hall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord"<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Hol. VI. 3.</NOTE> If the unregenerate follow on to know the Lord, then they perform the condition, to which there is an expre&s;s promi&s;e, that they &s;hall know the Lord. But the knowledge of God
<PB N="19" REF="011295_0013_0F869ECD3AFD49B0">
is peculiar to true &s;aints, and connected with eternal life. And he repre&s;ents the unregenerate as, on the whole, de&s;iring &s;alvation, and humbly applying to God for it, as did the prodigal; and hoping and tru&s;ting in the mere mercy of God, as exerci&s;ed to &s;inners, and a&s;king for it, as did the publican Now it is certain that promi&s;es of &s;alvation are made to all who hope in God's mercy, and really de&s;ire the &s;alvation offered in the go&s;pel, and come to Chri&s;t for it. Is not this very &s;trange, when he had not only formerly wrote a book to prove the contrary to all this; but in his preface to this, acknowledges I have proved the &s;ame beyond all controver&s;y, and heartily thanks me for it!</P>
<P N="4">4. The grand di&s;pute between Mr. M. and me is about the true character of the unregenerate &s;inner; Whether he, under the greate&s;t awakenings and convictions he ever is the &s;ubject of antecedent to re|generation, does not continue an impenitent, voluntary, inexcu&s;able, ob&s;tinate enemy to God, and the Redeemer? If Mr. M. will grant this, he will grant the &s;um of what I contend for. But he has been &s;o far from it, that all his book is really wrote again&s;t it.</P>
<P>On the whole, Mr. M. has really taken up Dr. Mayhew's cau&s;e, and repre&s;ents the unregenerate &s;inner in much the &s;ame light in which <HI>he</HI> did, as the ground of mo&s;t or his arguments to prove that promi&s;es are made to him. Mr. M. does not expre&s;sly &s;ay indeed that there are promi&s;es made to the unregenerate; but the contrary. But herein he is more incon&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf, than was Dr. Mayhew: for if Mr. M. gives them a true character, the bible is full of promi&s;es to them. And he actually applies pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture to them, which contain promi&s;es, as has been ob&s;erved; and he might with as much propriety apply all tho&s;e &s;criptures to them which Dr. Mayhew does; yea all the promi&s;es in the bible.</P>

<P>ARGUMENTS for the affirmative of the que&s;tion in di&s;pute.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN order to determine who is the greate&s;t &s;inner, or what way and manner of &s;inning is mo&s;t criminal, or what particular &s;in is mo&s;t aggravated, we mu&s;t fir&s;t con&s;ider and determine, wherein the guilt of criminalne&s;s of &s;in, of all &s;in, chiefly lies, or what is the greate&s;t aggra|vation of all &s;in, which does above every thing el&s;e render it vile and criminal.</P>
<P>And in this I &s;uppo&s;e all will be agreed, who have attended to this matter, and con&s;idered what rea&s;on and &s;cripture dictate on this head. The vilene&s;s and guilt of &s;in does chiefly and principally con&s;i&s;t in its being committed again&s;t GOD. GOD is &s;o great and excellent a being the &s;um of all exi&s;tence and perfection, that it is infinitely more criminal not to re&s;pect and love him, than it would be to have no love and regard for the whole creation. And it is in infinitely greater crime
<PB N="20" REF="011295_0014_0F869ECE5CA6E660">
to oppo&s;e and hate GOD, in any way, or in the lea&s;t degree, than it would be to hate and oppo&s;e all creatures, and turn an implacable, eternal enemy to them, if this might be, without hating and oppo&s;ing God in any re&s;pect or degree.</P>
<P>If a per&s;on &s;hould turn enemy to the whole human race, and with relentle&s;s hatred, rage and thir&s;t for blood, &s;hould murder his own parents, and all his relations and friends, in the mo&s;t cruel manner imaginable; and &s;hould he have it in his power, and go on to murder and de&s;troy a whole nation: and &s;hould he proceed and actually de&s;troy every one of the human race on earth; yea, put an utter end to the whole creation; and then lay violent hands on him&s;elf, and put an end to his own life: and could this be done, and not imply any rebellion again&s;t GOD or oppo&s;ition to him, but be con&s;i&s;tent with perfect love no him; the crime he would be guilty of in all this would be nothing, in compari&s;on with the lea&s;t degree of oppo&s;ition and di&s;re&s;pect to GOD: Yea, it would be infinitely le&s;s than the lea&s;t motion of heart again&s;t GOD, or the lea&s;t defect of perfect love to him for one mo|ment.&mdash;It is granted there can be no &s;uch thing as is here &s;uppo&s;ed; becau&s;e all hatred and oppo&s;ition exerci&s;ed immediately towards our fellow creatures, is implicitly and really oppo&s;ition to being in general, and &s;o is again&s;t GOD; and it is al&s;o again&s;t GOD as 'tis a violation of his command: and therefore the crime of inju&s;tice, murder, &amp;c. &s;um|marily con&s;i&s;ts in it's being again&s;t GOD; and not in the injury done to our fellow creatures. This I conclude all with whom I am concerned in this di&s;pute, will readily grant. I therefore proceed to ob&s;erve further,</P>
<P>THAT act of &s;in and rebellion again&s;t GOD has immen&s;ely more crime and guilt in it, which is exerci&s;ed and committed directly and immediately again&s;t Him; than that which is done again&s;t him me|diately, and more remotely or indirectly. Or every &s;in is more or le&s;s aggravated and criminal, according as it is committed more directly and immediately again&s;t GOD or not, other circum&s;tances being alike.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate this it may be ob&s;erved, &s;ome &s;inful exerci&s;es and con|duct are directly and immediately again&s;t GOD; he is the immediate object again&s;t which they are committed, and he is in them directly injured and oppo&s;ed. We have an in&s;tance of this in Pharaoh when he &s;aid "Who is the LORD, that I &s;hould obey his voice?" And an|other in the people of I&s;rael, when they &s;aid "The way of the LORD is not equal."</P>
<P>There are many &s;ins again&s;t GOD more indirectly and remotely. Such are acts of inju&s;tice towards our fellow men. The&s;e are ulti|mately again&s;t GOD, as has been ob&s;erved; but they are directly and immediately again&s;t our fellow creatures. Such are all tho&s;e ways and exerci&s;es of &s;in, which have the creature for their direct and immediate object, the&s;e are more remotely again&s;t GOD, as they are not directly aimed again&s;t him but &s;trike at him more indirectly, thro' the creature.</P>
<P>Now all acts of &s;in are more or le&s;s aggravated and criminal accor|ding as they are done more or le&s;s directly again&s;t GOD, as it has been
<PB N="21" REF="011295_0014_0F869ECE5CA6E660">
now explained. An act of direct enmity again&s;t GOD, and a cour&s;e of direct quarrelling and bla&s;phemy again&s;t him is immen&s;ely more cri|minal, than hating and oppo&s;ing a man; tho' this is implicitly and more remotely, and by fair con&s;truction again&s;t GOD.</P>
<P>If a man murders one of his fellow &s;ubjects, he hereby acts again&s;t his prince; he does him an injury and breaks his laws; but his crime would be immen&s;ely greater if he had murdered his prince. If a &s;er|vant quarrels with his fellow &s;ervants, and abu&s;es them, tho' this is an injury to his lord, and a violation of his orders; yet this is an un|&s;peakable le&s;s crime than that which he is guilty of, who ri&s;es up im|mediately again&s;t his lord in per&s;on, quarrels with him and &s;trikes him. The&s;e in&s;tances may &s;erve in &s;ome mea&s;ure to illu&s;trate the ca&s;e before us: tho' it mu&s;t be remembered there is an infinite odds: as in the&s;e in&s;tances, there is &s;ome proportion between the crime of murdering a fellow &s;ubject, or abu&s;ing a fellow &s;ervant, and that of the &s;ame acts done directly again&s;t the prince or lord; whereas in the ca&s;e before us there is no proportion, the one being infinitely more criminal than the other.</P>
<P>LET it be &s;till further ob&s;erved, that tho&s;e &s;ins that are more imme|diately and directly again&s;t GOD as well as all others, may be many ways greatly aggravated, &s;o as to be immen&s;ely more criminal, than the lea&s;t &s;uppo&s;able &s;in of this kind. A per&s;on's obligations to love God with all his heart, &amp;c. may be va&s;tly increa&s;ed by GOD's good|ne&s;s to him, and the great and &s;pecial favours he receives from him; by the advantages which he is put under to know GOD and &s;erve him, and the light and in&s;truction which he enjoys; the great and &s;pecial motives, admonitions and reproofs &s;et before him, and the variety of means u&s;ed with him to reclaim him. And his &s;in in not loving GOD, but per&s;i&s;ting in impenitence and rebellion again&s;t him, is criminal in proportion to the increa&s;e of his obligations by means of the&s;e things, and others of the &s;ame kind, that night be mentioned.</P>
<P>And it mu&s;t be particularly ob&s;erved here, that what GOD has done for the redemption of man by Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and the offers of free par|don and &s;alvation through him, does aggravate the &s;inners guilt in &s;in|ning again&s;t GOD, above any thing el&s;e; and &s;inning again&s;t Chri&s;t and the go&s;pel and rejecting and de&s;pi&s;ing him, are immen&s;ely the bigge&s;t and mo&s;t criminal acts of &s;in again&s;t GOD, that can be.</P>

All other &s;ins are &s;mall, compared with this of neglecting this great &s;alvation with per&s;evering ob&s;tinacy and contempt, and rejecting and de&s;pi&s;ing the

glorious Saviour, offering him&s;elf to &s;inners in the mo&s;t kind and con|de&s;cending manner, and urging them to accept of him as their compleat redeemer, by the mo&s;t powerful motives and arguments imaginable. The devils have never &s;inned, nor can they &s;in in &s;uch an aggravated manner; becau&s;e they have no &s;uch offers, no &s;uch &s;alvation to reject; no &s;uch Redeemer to de&s;pi&s;e. What are all the &s;ins of the heathen world to this? They &s;ink, as it were, into nothing, when compared with it. What are all the &s;ins of Sodom to this? No wonder Chri&s;t tells the inhabitants of Capernaum, who had rejected him, when he offered him&s;elf to them, that it would be more tolerable in the day of judgment for the mo&s;t abandoned profligates of Sodom, than for them; and tells the 70 when he &s;ent them to preach the go&s;pel that the city which &s;hould not receive them, &s;hould, for this &s;in only, let their con|duct otherwi&s;e be as it would, receive a heavier doom, than the Sodom|ites &s;hould for all their abominable, open debauchery and wickedne&s;s, which cried to heaven, and brought terrible vengeance on their heads.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luk. X. 10,&mdash;12.</NOTE> And this view of the ca&s;e gives a very natural and ea&s;y meaning to Chri&s;t's words, when he &s;ays "If I had not came and &s;poken unto them, they had not had &s;in"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Joh. XV. 22.</NOTE> All the &s;ins they could have committed, had not a Saviour appeared and in&s;tructed them and offered him&s;elf to them, would have been light, and as nothing, compared with the &s;in of hating and rejecting him, which they were now guilty of: And perfectly agreeable to this are the following words of his, "And when he (i. e. the Spirit) is come, he will reprove the world of &s;in,&mdash;<HI>becau&s;e they believe not on me.</HI>"<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Joh. XVI. 9.</NOTE> Here not believing on Chri&s;t is repre&s;ented as the greate&s;t &s;in men can be guilty of, &s;o that it does, in a &s;en&s;e &s;wallow up all other &s;ins, as not to be mentioned with this, this being the &s;um of all. This is the great &s;in for which the Spirit will reprove men, when he does his work effectually, and thoroughly convinces of &s;in. Hence we may certainly infer that they who &s;ubmit to this reproof, and are truly convinced of &s;in, &s;ee this &s;in to be &s;o great that all other &s;ins are as nothing to it: Therefore that this is the great aggravation of all their &s;ins, and that in which their guilt and vilene&s;s principally con&s;i&s;ts. All the &s;in men commit under the go&s;pel; all the mo&s;t abo|minable uncleanne&s;s and debauchery, all the murder, profanene&s;s and bla&s;phemy, that men are, or can be guilty of, under the go&s;pel, have their chief aggravation in this, that they are again&s;t Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and carry in them unbelief and oppo&s;ition to him; &s;o that unbelief it&s;elf in all the actings and exerci&s;es of it, is un&s;peakably a greater crime, than all this wickedne&s;s, con&s;idered in it&s;elf and not as implying and expre&s;&s;ing unbelief and rejection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t: and therefore un|&s;peakable more criminal and vile than all the &s;ins of Sodom, as they had no opportunity to &s;in again&s;t Chri&s;t, as go&s;pel &s;inners do. Or, to expre&s;s it in other words, all the &s;ins of Sodom, and all the abominati|ons that have been committed by the wor&s;t of men, or that men can po&s;&s;ibly commit, without being guilty of unbelief and rejecting Chri&s;t and the go&s;pel, are incomparably le&s;s criminal and vile than this &s;in of
<PB N="23" REF="011295_0015_0F869ECEB6CF2C78">
unbelief, or not receiving, but rejecting Chri&s;t, when he is revealed and offered to men; &s;o that when the former are put in the &s;cale with latter, they are light and as nothing to this. Who can doubt of this, &s;ince it is &s;o fully and nece&s;&s;arily implied, in what Chri&s;t him&s;elf has declared more than once? E&s;pecially when the rea&s;on of it is &s;o appa|rent to every one who will &s;eriou&s;ly attend to the matter. It hence appears certain, even to a demon&s;tration, that he is the mo&s;t guilty, vile &s;inner who exerci&s;es the greate&s;t degree of unbelief; or does mo&s;t directly, and in the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t ob&s;tinate manner, reject Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Whether the awakened, convinced &s;inner does this; or whe|ther his unbelief and oppo&s;ition to Je&s;us Chri&s;t and the go&s;pel is le&s;s in the &s;trength and degree of its exerci&s;e, I &s;hall more particularly con|&s;ider pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved yet further, that unbelief, or an impenitent re|jecting Je&s;us Chri&s;t now, under the full blaze of go&s;pel light, and clear convictions of con&s;cience, is much more criminal and vile, than it was when Chri&s;t was on earth, becau&s;e they then had not &s;o much light, &s;uch a fullne&s;s of means and advantages, even under the preaching of Chri&s;t, and in &s;ight of his miracles, as we now have. This might be ea&s;ily proved, was there need; but I &s;uppo&s;e none will di&s;pute it. Therefore if unbelief and rejecting him, was &s;o great a &s;in, and did &s;o far out weigh all other &s;ins in guilt, as to be, as it were, the only &s;in, and &s;um of all, in compari&s;on with which all others were hardly to be mentioned; how amazingly great mu&s;t be the guilt of this &s;in now; e&s;pecially in them who have the greate&s;t advantages, and the mo&s;t light of every kind, and for whom the mo&s;t is done, even all that can be done &s;hort of regenerating grace!</P>
<P>The &s;cripture el&s;ewhere &s;ets the matter in this light, and repre&s;ents the crime of di&s;regarding Chri&s;t and rebelling again&s;t him, when he &s;peaks directly and immediately unto them, as un&s;peakably greater, than di&s;obedience to his word when &s;poken by others,&mdash;and &s;o that he is not &s;o fully and directly in view.</P>
<P>To this purpo&s;e are the following words, "For if the word &s;poken by angels was &s;tedfa&s;t, and every tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and di&s;obedience receiv|ed a ju&s;t recompence of rewards; how &s;hall we e&s;cape if we <HI>neglect</HI> &s;o great &s;alvation, which at fir&s;t began to be &s;poken by the LORD, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him!"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. II. 2, 3.</NOTE> Here two things are ob&s;ervable,</P>
<P N="1">1. The great crime &s;poken of, which will i&s;&s;ue in the mo&s;t awful condemnation and puni&s;hment, is a bare NEGLECT of the &s;alvation offered by Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. The great and peculiar aggravation of this crime is &s;poken of as con&s;i&s;ting in the <HI>direct</HI> rebellion again&s;t Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which this neglect carries in it, as he has him&s;elf, in his own per&s;on, revealed and offered this &s;alvation to men. This being more direct and immediate rebellion again&s;t him, than was the di&s;obedience to a revelation made by angels.</P>
<P>The &s;ame thing is &s;et in a yet &s;tronger light in the &s;ame epi&s;tle, "He

that de&s;pi&s;ed Mo&s;es's law, died without mercy.&mdash;Of how much &s;orer puni&s;hment, &s;uppo&s;e ye, &s;hall he be thought worthy, who hath troden under foot the Son of God! &amp;c"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb.

<P>This is again &s;et in the &s;ame light, "See that ye refu&s;e not him that &s;peaketh: for if they e&s;caped not who refu&s;ed him that &s;poke on earth, much more &s;hall not we e&s;cape, if we <HI>turn away from him</HI> that &s;peaketh from heaven."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. XII. 25.</NOTE></P>
<P>They who refu&s;ed Mo&s;es, who &s;poke on earth (by whom are mo&s;t probably meant Korah, Dathan and Abiram, and tho&s;e who &s;inned with them) did rebel again&s;t Chri&s;t, but not immediately and directly: they had no thought of oppo&s;ing Chri&s;t; but intended their oppo&s;ition directly again&s;t Mo&s;es. They who reject the go&s;pel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urn away from Chri&s;t, and directly oppo&s;e and reject him, who &s;peaks to them from heaven. And this is here con&s;idered as an un&s;peakable aggravation of the &s;in of the latter above that of the former. And it is to be here ob&s;erved that the &s;in here &s;poken of as the great &s;in, and &s;o greatly ag|gravated by this circum&s;tance, con&s;i&s;ts wholly in refu&s;ing, or turning away from Chri&s;t, of which, every unregenerate &s;inner is con&s;tantly guilty: but more e&s;pecially awakened, convinced &s;inners, to whom Chri&s;t &s;peaks in a degree and manner he does not to others, even to their con&s;ciences; and who knowingly, and under conviction of what they are doing turn away from him, and refu&s;e to hear him.</P>
<P>From this view of things it will follow that the awakened, convinced &s;inner, who per&s;i&s;ts in unbelief and rejection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is more guilty and vile in the &s;tate and exerci&s;es of his mind than he was in a &s;tate of &s;ecurity, if he more directly and immediately oppo&s;es GOD and Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and with as great or greater &s;trength of heart than he did before. And this, I think, will appear to be true beyond all con|tradiction or doubt, if the following things are well con&s;idered.&mdash;</P>
<P>THE &s;ecure, unawakened &s;inner, does not &s;in &s;o directly and imme|diately again&s;t GOD, as does the awakened, convinced &s;inner. GOD is very little in his view and thoughts. It is with him in this re&s;pect very much as if there was no GOD, and no Saviour. His perfect &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, which carries in it oppo&s;ition to GOD and Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is exerci&s;ed not directly again&s;t GOD and the go&s;pel; but in &s;eeking what appears to him the greate&s;t good, in the gratification of his &s;elfi&s;h|ne&s;s and lu&s;ts; which lead him directly to oppo&s;e and injure his fellow creatures, in a greater or le&s;s degree. He may &s;in again&s;t the light of his con&s;cience in a degree; but then this light and the&s;e dictates are &s;uppo&s;ed to be weak and in a low degree, el&s;e he would not be a &s;ecure, unawakened &s;inner; for &s;o far as a per&s;on's con&s;cience is enlightened to &s;hew him his &s;in and real danger, it mu&s;t give him unea&s;ine&s;s; be|cau&s;e &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s itself is nece&s;&s;arily aver&s;e to mi&s;ery, and he mu&s;t be unea&s;y, &s;o far as he &s;ees him&s;elf expo&s;ed to it. This is the great dif|ference
<PB N="25" REF="011295_0016_0F869ED3FB774440">
between the &s;ecure and awakened, convinced &s;inner; the for|mer is not convinced of his &s;in and danger, in any mea&s;ure as it really is, and &s;o as to give him any unea&s;ine&s;s about it; the latter is in a greater mea&s;ure convinced of both; and the light and dictates of his con&s;cience, &s;hewing the connexion of his pre&s;ent &s;tate and conduct, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> per&s;i&s;ted in, with eternal mi&s;ery, are the &s;ole ground of all the alteration of his conduct, his exerci&s;es and di&s;tre&s;s of mind. The &s;ecure &s;inner may indeed have a &s;ort of conviction of con&s;cience that what he allows him&s;elf in is wrong and contrary to God's commands, but has no clear apprehen&s;ions of his &s;infulne&s;s, and does not reallize it that he is acting again&s;t God, or that God is angry with him, and will certainly de&s;troy him, if he per&s;i&s;t in his ways. He only wants to have clear and full conviction of con&s;cience of this, in order to be an awakened, convinced &s;inner.&mdash;</P>
<P>On the other hand, the awakened, convinced &s;inner, &s;ins more direct|ly and immediately again&s;t God and the Saviour, and in the face of the clear dictates of his own con&s;cience. If a &s;inner's con&s;cience is only awakened to &s;ee that the ways of allowed external wickedne&s;s in which he lives, lead to hell, &s;o as to excite him to reform his life, and &s;o comes up to the dictates of his con&s;cience and makes him&s;elf ea&s;y; which has been the ca&s;e with thou&s;ands; this is not the awakened, con|vinced &s;inner of which I am &s;peaking. The con&s;cience of the &s;inner I am now attending to is &s;o enlightened, that he &s;ees he mu&s;t peri&s;h for|ever unle&s;s he willingly &s;ubmits to Je&s;us Chri&s;t and tru&s;ts in him, to which he is invited, and urged by the &s;tronge&s;t motives; and to which he is under indi&s;pen&s;able obligations. And under this light and con|viction of con&s;cience he feels him&s;elf going to a dreadful hell, for his impenitence and unbelief and continuing to reject Je&s;us Chri&s;t and the go&s;pel, and yet per&s;i&s;ts in his ob&s;tinacy and mo&s;t daring rebellion again&s;t God, and horrid abu&s;e of the mo&s;t worthy, and a&s;toni&s;hingly merciful Redeemer; for which he is convinced he has no excu&s;e.</P>
<P>He is now diverted from the pur&s;uit of worldly plea&s;ures in the gra|tification of tho&s;e lu&s;ts which urged him on in a &s;tate of &s;ecurity; and his attention is turned more immediately and directly to GOD and the Redeemer; and his heart is exerci&s;ed in direct oppo&s;ition and enmity to the divine character, and the Saviour, and goes into an immediate quarrel with God. It appears therefore that in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">his re&s;pect, his exer|ci&s;es of oppo&s;ition to GOD are immen&s;ely aggravated.</P>
<P>And it is to be ob&s;erved that his exerci&s;es of heart, now they are turned directly again&s;t God and the Saviour, are as &s;trong and vigorous as ever; and he not only oppo&s;es God more directly, and again&s;t the clear light of his con&s;cience; but more &s;trongly, and exerci&s;es a greater degree of hatred and enmity again&s;t his character and ways, than he did before. He was an enemy to GOD before, and all his exerci&s;es and conduct were a mediate and implicit oppo&s;ition to him; even while he had little or no idea of his character, and few thoughts of God. But now the divine character and conduct are in &s;ome mea&s;ure brought into view, and the attention of his mind is held up to them;
<PB N="26" REF="011295_0017_0F869ED52BCA3480">
which nece&s;&s;arily occa&s;ions a greater degree of the exerci&s;e of oppo&s;iti|on, hatred and enmity, than when the hateful object was le&s;s in view, &s;o long as he is no more reconciled to this character than he was, and the enmity of the heart is not at all abated or weakened. This is the ca&s;e in all in&s;tances of oppo&s;ition of heart, and fixed enmity to each other's per&s;ons and characters among men. The&s;e enemies, while they are out of each other's view, and think little or nothing of each other, will have no direct and po&s;&s;itive exertions of hatred and enmity: But let them be brought into each other's view, and come together, and their enmity will ri&s;e into direct and &s;trong exerci&s;es, and ferment to a high degree. We find it &s;o with regard to any thing at which we have a peculiar and fixed di&s;gu&s;t and aver&s;ion, the nearer it is brought to us, and the more it is in our view, the more lively and &s;trong is our aver&s;ion to it. And there can be no po&s;&s;ible rea&s;on given why it &s;hould not be &s;o in the ca&s;e before us; yea it is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e. It al&s;o appears from another con&s;ideration that in this ca&s;e the exerci&s;es of oppo&s;ition and enmity to GOD and the Redeemer mu&s;t be &s;trong in proportion to the increa&s;e of light and conviction and the powerful motives which are oppo&s;ed; for it requires a greater exertion of oppo&s;ition to re&s;i&s;t greater light and more powerful motives, than it does to re&s;i&s;t le&s;s.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee the awakened, convinced &s;inner not only exerts him&s;elf more directly again&s;t God and the Redeemer than he did in a &s;tate of &s;ecurity; but does this in a much higher and &s;tronger degree, on which account his wickedne&s;s is immen&s;ely increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o to be remembered that his &s;infulne&s;s is not only increa&s;ed in the greater &s;trength and vigor of his oppo&s;ition of heart to GOD and the Saviour; but the&s;e exerci&s;es are now more con&s;tant and nu|merous, as the mind is awakened up to the greate&s;t attention to the&s;e things, and is more engaged in thoughts and exerci&s;es, perhaps, than ever it was in a &s;tate of &s;ecurity. And he thinks now a thou&s;and times more about GOD and Chri&s;t, &amp;c. than he did; and his exerci&s;es of heart are proportionably con&s;tant and numerous. But the&s;e exerci&s;es are all again&s;t GOD and the go&s;pel; therefore the more con&s;tant and numerous they are, the more guilty and vile the &s;inner is.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the light and conviction of con&s;cience the &s;inner has, not only occa&s;ions more direct acts of oppo&s;ition to GOD, which are al&s;o more &s;trong, con&s;tant and numerous, than they could be in a &s;tate of &s;ecurity; but the &s;uperior light they have in the awakening and con|viction of their con&s;cience greatly aggravates all their impenitence and oppo&s;ition to GOD. GOD has not only given them an external reve|lation, and put them, in common with all others under the go&s;pel, under advantage to know the truth and obey the go&s;pel: but has done much more for them. When they were going on &s;tupid and incon&s;i|derate under this light, he has ordered a light to be forcibly let into their con&s;ciences, and given them a thou&s;and times more light than they had in a &s;tate of &s;ecurity; and which they never would have had, if GOD had not interpo&s;ed. This mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a great favor
<PB N="27" REF="011295_0017_0F869ED52BCA3480">
and advantage in it&s;elf, by which they are un&s;peakably di&s;tingui&s;hed from &s;inners in a &s;tate of ignorance, &s;ecurity and ea&s;e: Which favour and advantage they &s;in again&s;t and abu&s;e, by which all their rebellion and ob&s;tinacy in hating and oppo&s;ing GOD and rejecting the go&s;pel, is immen&s;ely aggravated. So that this di&s;tingui&s;hed light and conviction, being rebelled again&s;t and re&s;i&s;ted, becomes the occa&s;ion of an amazing increa&s;e of guilt and vilene&s;s, in&s;tead of making it le&s;s.</P>
<P>If this will be the condemnation of men, that light is come into the world, and they have loved darkne&s;s, rather than light<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> have hated the light, oppo&s;ed and &s;inner again&s;t it; &s;urely they &s;hall be thought worthy of the greate&s;t condemnation, who have per&s;i&s;ted in &s;in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and rebellion in oppo&s;ition to the cleare&s;t light &s;et into their con&s;ciences by God's &s;pecial interpo&s;ition, in an uncommon and extraordinary degree.</P>
<P>Let it be al&s;o ob&s;erved, that the awakened, convinced &s;inner, under all his conviction and external reformation, per&s;i&s;ts in the neglect of all that God requires of him, and wholly and ob&s;tinately refu&s;es to com|ply in the lea&s;t degree, as he withholds his whole heart from GOD and Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and neglects and refu&s;es to love GOD or his fellow men, or to hearken to Chri&s;t, whom he is commanded to hear and obey by all the authority of heaven. And this neglect of his whole duty is immen&s;ely aggravated by the light and conviction he now has, by which he &s;ees what is his duty, and what is his intere&s;t a thou&s;and times more fully and clearly than any &s;ecure, unawakened &s;inner does. Je&s;us Chri&s;t does now, by all this light and conviction let into his con|&s;cience, "Stand at the door and knock" in a manner and degree, in which he did not before. If this is ju&s;tly con&s;idered, it will appear that the increa&s;e of guilt by this means only, is &s;o great that no &s;up|po&s;ed reformation in external conduct will in any mea&s;ure balance it, even on &s;uppo&s;ition there is as much negative goodne&s;s as any one is di&s;po&s;ed to imagine. All the negative goodne&s;s that can be &s;uppo&s;ed in any external reformation, is immen&s;ely over balanced by the increa&s;e of po&s;itive guilt and vilene&s;s, which now takes place in the convinced &s;inner, in the way ju&s;t now mentioned.</P>
<P>Let it be further ob&s;erved, that this reformation in his external be|haviour and conduct, is not from the lea&s;t degree of right principle and exerci&s;e; or becau&s;e he is at heart more friendly to GOD, or in any degree a le&s;s enemy; but purely from &s;elf-love; even that very &s;elf love, in the exerci&s;e of which, he now &s;ets him&s;elf directly again&s;t GOD, and goes into a cour&s;e of more immediate oppo&s;ition to him. GOD has ordered light and conviction to be given to his con&s;cience, and has in this way taken him and &s;haken him over hell, and cau&s;ed the fire of his wrath, as it were, to fla&s;h in his face. This has filled him with terror, and has deadened his heart to all his worldly pur&s;uits, in which before he plea&s;ed and gratified him&s;elf. The fears of hell have put a &s;top to all his former cour&s;es, and turned all his attention to his future and eternal intere&s;t, in the exerci&s;e of the &s;ame <HI>&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s,</HI> which in a &s;tate of &s;ecurity urged him into all his overt acts of open or &s;ecret wickedne&s;s. And this darling lu&s;t he will not give up, nor is it
<PB N="28" REF="011295_0018_0F869ED604FCF270">
abated in the lea&s;t degree, but he exerci&s;es it in as high a degree as ever, yea much more &s;trongly, in direct oppo&s;ition to GOD and the Saviour, in all his exerci&s;es and attempts with re&s;pect to the &s;alvation he de&s;ires. He is re&s;trained from the overt acts of allowed &s;in he lived in before by nothing but the fears of hell: Take this out of the way, and he will return to his old cour&s;es with more greedine&s;s than ever. And if he was not afraid of GOD, but really thought he could oppo&s;e him with impunity and &s;ucce&s;s, all his fears and prayers would cea&s;e in a moment, and he would go right into allowed, overt acts of direct rebellion and bla&s;phemy again&s;t him. This I ob&s;erve, that we may judge more agreeable to the truth, of the reformation of the awakened &s;inner: and &s;urely if we view this matter in a true light, we &s;hall find nothing in the greate&s;t reformation of this kind, that will in any degree counter-balance the immen&s;ely greater guilt and vilene&s;s which the awakening and conviction of con&s;cience that he has fallen under, is the occa&s;ion of.</P>
<P>His heart is in no re&s;pect better, more friendly to GOD, or le&s;s an enemy to him. The principles and motives on which he reforms are really as bad as tho&s;e, under the influence of which he before went on in open &s;in! Yea, they are the &s;ame, and now his wickedne&s;s is turned into another channel, and exerci&s;ed more directly and in a higher degree again&s;t God.</P>
<P>No external conduct is better or wor&s;e, or has any thing of a mo|ral nature in it, any further than is connected with the heart, and is con&s;idered as the expre&s;&s;ion and effect of the voluntary exerci&s;es of that. And all the guilt and vilene&s;s of it lies in the&s;e exerci&s;es of the heart. So that every per&s;on is more or le&s;s guilty and vile accor|ding as the exerci&s;es of his heart are: and he who&s;e heart is not mended, and made better or le&s;s vile than it has been, is not really reformed at all, whatever alteration there is in his external conduct. If then the heart is yet as unfriendly to God, and oppo&s;es him as much as ever, yea in a more direct and &s;tronger manner, with what propriety can he, upon the whole, be called a reformed &s;inner? Mr. M. has made great u&s;e of this phra&s;e, THE REFORMED SINNER, and he has con&s;tantly u&s;ed it &s;o that it tends to blind and deceive the reader, who is not di&s;|po&s;ed to look to the bottom of this matter.</P>
<P>IF the&s;e things are impartially con&s;idered, and we keep in view the high and glorious character of the Mediator, and the a&s;toni&s;hing grace of the go&s;pel, and the &s;tate and character of the &s;inner who continues voluntarily to hate, oppo&s;e and reject the Mediator with all his heart, under the greate&s;t light and conviction of con&s;cience, for which he has no more rea&s;on or excu&s;e, than he would have for any overt acts of mo&s;t gro&s;s wickedne&s;s: I &s;ay, if this matter is well and impartially con&s;idered, I believe it will appear mo&s;t evident that the awakened, convinced &s;inner is much more guilty and vile in the exerci&s;es of his heart, than he could be, on any &s;uppo&s;ition in a &s;tate of &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>MANKIND do commonly judge quite wrong and contrary to truth in this matter. They over look the great malignity of &s;in, and are igno|rant
<PB N="29" REF="011295_0018_0F869ED604FCF270">
of that wherein it's guilt and vilene&s;s chiefly con&s;i&s;ts, and &s;o judge according to outward appearance, and not righteous judgment. It is common for per&s;ons to look upon the lea&s;t degree of inju&s;tice towards men in dealing with them; e&s;pecially if they them&s;elves are directly injured by it in any degree, to be a greater crime than the highe&s;t acts of profanene&s;s and taking GOD's name in vain a thou&s;and times, and the former is un&s;peakably more odious and vile in their eyes, than the latter. The rea&s;on is becau&s;e GOD is very much out of their &s;ight and thoughts, and they have no real love and re&s;pect to him; &s;o &s;ee not any real injury done by the latter, or any thing very bad or &s;hameful in it; e&s;pecially when it is very much the cu&s;tom and fa&s;hion. But they are all &s;en&s;ibility to their own intere&s;t; therefore are ready to hate tho&s;e who oppo&s;e and injure them, and look on them as very vile and criminal, even as de&s;erving eternal damnation.</P>
<P>There are multitudes who are governed by the prejudices of educa|tion, or wholly by outward appearance, in their views and judgment of things of this kind: yea, this is very common, if not mo&s;t generally the ca&s;e. By the force of education, and the common &s;entiments and cu&s;|toms where per&s;ons live, many practices appear mo&s;t odious, &s;hockingly vile and &s;hameful, which are really un&s;peakably le&s;s criminal, than other things which appear to them to be innocent, and even commend|able. In&s;tances of this are &s;o common and apparent, that it is needle&s;s to illu&s;trate it by examples.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. M. has, in much that he has &s;aid on this head, applied to the imagination, and to the prejudices of mankind with re&s;pect to the&s;e things, as will be ob&s;erved by the attentive reader: which I think, has no tendency to give light, but rather to blind and deceive. He &s;eems to be &s;en&s;ible of the advantage he has to influence his reader by this way of treating the matter; which appears not only by his taking this method, as has been ob&s;erved, but by his guarding again&s;t a &s;trict ex|amination of the matter by &s;ound and clear rea&s;oning and argument, calling it "metaphy&s;ical rea&s;oning and argument," and endeavour|ing to prejudice the reader again&s;t it, as that which is not to be de|pended upon or regarded; as any thing, and even contraries may be proved by it.&mdash;But they who will not lay a&s;ide the common prejudices that mankind are under, and a mere warm imagination, and attend clo&s;ely to the dictates of &s;ound, accurate rea&s;oning (which I call "me|taphy&s;ical arguments" and at pre&s;ent know not what el&s;e Mr. M. can mean by this phra&s;e) I &s;ay, they who will not do this, are like to live in darkne&s;s and delu&s;ion; and to believe any thing, be it never &s;o ab&s;urd and contrary to &s;cripture and rea&s;on.</NOTE></P>
<P>All per&s;ons that are unawakened are wont to judge of them&s;elves with re&s;pect to their &s;infulne&s;s, and the degree of their guilt and vile|ne&s;s, by their external conduct. Therefore their fir&s;t convictions of con&s;cience mo&s;t commonly fix upon that, by which they fir&s;t begin to learn their own &s;infulne&s;s, God's anger with them, and the &s;ad &s;tate they are in. This puts them upon reformation of their &s;ins, omi&s;&s;ions,
<PB N="30" REF="011295_0019_0F869ED63A4DF2F8">
and commi&s;&s;ions, which now &s;tare them in the face as provoking to God and leading to de&s;truction. By this they hope to mend their ca&s;e, and become in a great degree innocent, &s;o as to remove the cur&s;e of GOD's di&s;plea&s;ure. And if they receive no further light and convic|tion, they will re&s;t in this, and think all is well. But if they go on to any good degree of thorough conviction, they will &s;ee things in quite a different &s;ight, and find that in them&s;elves which is un&s;peakably more criminal than any thing which they &s;aw before; that this vilene&s;s lies in their heart, which is not at all mended by all their external refor|mations and duties.</P>
<P>I SAY not the&s;e things with a view to extenuate the guilt and vilene&s;s of the open profligate, and of the&s;e open &s;ins which are ju&s;tly &s;hocking and terrible; or to lead any per&s;ons to look on them le&s;s vile and odi|ous than they now do. No, far be it! The&s;e &s;ins are immen&s;ely more heinous and vile than the profligate thinks them to be, or than any one el&s;e can fully conceive. The &s;ecure, unconvinced &s;inner is guilty and vile beyond, far beyond, any thing he ever imagined; his guilt and vilene&s;s exceed all thought: But yet all this, viewed in a comparative light, may be little and as nothing, when compared with the immen&s;ely more aggravated guilt of a &s;inner, per&s;i&s;ting in rebellion, impenitence and ob&s;tinacy in oppo&s;ition to the clear light and dictates of his con&s;cience. Our Saviour's repre&s;enting the inhabitants of Capernaum as wor&s;e than tho&s;e of Sodom, is nothing in favor of the open abominations that were practi&s;ed by the latter, nor tends to extenuate their criminalne&s;s, or encourage &s;uch practices; but only &s;ets the guilt of the former in a true and &s;triking light.</P>
<P>WHAT has been &s;aid on this argument may be in &s;ome mea&s;ure re|pre&s;ented by the following &s;imilitude.</P>
<P>In the di&s;tant parts of the realm of a great and good prince there lived a man, who was brought up without any true apprehen&s;ions of the character of his prince, or any degree of true affection or regard to him, his government, or any of his &s;ubjects, but under the influence of directly oppo&s;ite principles. When he grew up, and came to act for him&s;elf he appeared perfectly &s;elfi&s;h, having no regard to any one, any further than he could an&s;wer his own ends by him: and therefore hating and oppo&s;ing every one who in his view &s;tood in the way of his good and intere&s;t, which he greedily pur&s;ued in the gratification of his vo|racious appetites and lu&s;ts. In the eager pur&s;uit of &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures, riches and honors, he injured many of his fellow &s;ubjects many ways, and to a great degree. At length they oppo&s;ed him &s;o much in his pur&s;uits, that he fell upon them, and killed &s;ome thou&s;ands, and took their goods as a booty to him&s;elf. He was often told that the&s;e prac|tices were a gro&s;s violation of the laws of his prince, and that he would one day call him to an account, and puni&s;h him for it. But he gave very little heed to this; he never entertained a &s;erious thought about it, and did not really believe what was told him, tho' he a&s;&s;ented to it as truth, and never di&s;puted it in his own mind. Indeed, it was not
<PB N="31" REF="011295_0019_0F869ED63A4DF2F8">
often that he had a thought of his prince; tho' he was frequently &s;poken of in his hearing, and his laws were read to him, threatening &s;uch practices as he lived in, with the &s;evere&s;t puni&s;hment: And when he did think of him, he could not realize it that he was angry with him, or would ever puni&s;h him, as he did not think he had ever done him any hurt, or was in the lea&s;t unfriendly to him: and as he always took him to be a very kind and merciful prince. Thus he went on in ig|norance, &s;ecurity and ea&s;e for many years.</P>
<P>At length the prince &s;ent a &s;pecial officer with orders to apprehend him, confi&s;cate all his goods and hang him in gibbets, as a monument of his di&s;plea&s;ure and vengeance, unle&s;s he would become a hearty friend to him, repent of his rebellion, and &s;ubmit to his laws and government as good and excellent, and accept of a free pardon which he was ready to grant thro' the interpo&s;ition of his own &s;on, who had interpo&s;ed his own merit with his father in behalf of this rebel, and be|came an earne&s;t interce&s;&s;or for him, having him&s;elf undertaken to make good all the damages this wretch had done to him and his kingdom; which pardon was now freely offered to him without money or price, if he was willing to receive it thro' the interpo&s;ition of this &s;on of the prince, and ready to depend wholly upon his merit and worthine&s;s for it; and give him&s;elf up to him, con&s;idered in this character, and be his friend and faithful &s;ervant to the end of his life.</P>
<P>Upon his being thus apprehended, and finding what orders were given, his mind was filled with anxiety and di&s;tre&s;s in a view of the evil ca&s;e he had brought him&s;elf into; and for&s;ook his former co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r&s;es immediately, not becau&s;e he was at heart any more friendly to his fel|low &s;ubjects, or any better di&s;po&s;ed towards his prince, or le&s;s inclined to rebellion; but merely through the fears and terrors which had &s;eized his mind in a view of the terrible puni&s;hment he was threatened with. He dreaded the puni&s;hment, and thought of it with horror. But when he con&s;idered the character and government of the prince, he found him&s;elf in no degree plea&s;ed with it, but the contrary. He found he was not willing to accept of a pardon on &s;uch terms, and was greatly di&s;plea&s;ed with the per&s;on, character and conduct of the &s;on; for in all he had done to procure his pardon, he had ju&s;tified his father, and con|demned the rebel to the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible degree. He therefore now went into a cour&s;e of direct oppo&s;ition to the prince and his &s;on; and he was &s;o far from being willing to accept of the pardon and deliver|ance offered, that he rejected the whole with great di&s;gu&s;t and contempt. And the more he attended to the affair, and con&s;idered the character of the prince and his &s;on, and their treatment of him, the more did his heart ri&s;e in oppo&s;ition to them, and the offers made to him. The of|ficer in who&s;e cu&s;tody he was, often led him to the place of execution, where he &s;aw numbers of rebels hanging and &s;lowly expiring in the greate&s;t tortures; and this &s;ight filled his &s;oul with the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s and horror, not knowing but he &s;hould be executed immediately, and greatly fearing it: but this did not reconcile him in the lea&s;t degree to his prince or his &s;on, or di&s;po&s;e him to accept of the pardon offered.
<PB N="32" REF="011295_0020_0F869ED7089F88E8">
He had as great an aver&s;ion and oppo&s;ition of heart to the latter as to the former, and this oppo&s;ition was apparent, and exerted with a degree of &s;trength and &s;tubbornne&s;s in proportion to his dread of the evil threatened. And this was al&s;o the ca&s;e, when he attended to the pro|mi&s;es made him upon his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; the more he de&s;ired the deliver|ance offered, the more &s;trongly did his heart oppo&s;e the condition.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time his heart was really no more again&s;t his former practices than ever; he being yet as much as ever under the power of the &s;ame principles and lu&s;ts, which led him to them, in the circum|&s;tances in which he was then. And this was apparent from fact: for the officer gave him his liberty for a few days, upon which all his fears and terrors cea&s;ed and he thinking the bitterne&s;s of death was pa&s;t, returned to his former cour&s;es with as much greedine&s;s as ever; yea, va&s;tly more.</P>
<P>When the officer &s;eized him again, his former views and terrors and dread of the prince returned. He was all attention to his ca&s;e, and im|ployed all his thoughts to find out &s;ome way to e&s;cape. Could he have found any way to deliver him&s;elf from the hand and power of the prince; or had it been in his power to dethrone him and his &s;on, he would have done it with all his heart. But as he knew this was im|po&s;&s;ible, he applied to his prince daily with earne&s;t petitions that he would pity his ca&s;e, and at lea&s;t mitigate his puni&s;hment, offering to &s;uffer any thing &s;hort of death. He made his great reformation, a plea for pardon and deliverance, and made great promi&s;es of what he would do, if he would relea&s;e him from this puni&s;hment. But when he found all this availed nothing; but was e&s;teemed by the prince and his &s;on as real rebellion again&s;t them, it being in direct oppo&s;ition to what they in&s;i&s;ted on, and the fruit of enmity to their character and conduct; and that nothing would do or avail in his behalf but an hearty accept|ance of the pardon offered, with a heart friendly to the prince, and ready to ju&s;tify him in all his conduct towards him; and a thankful acceptance of the mediation of his &s;on, being heartily willing to be his &s;ervant for life, as the greate&s;t priviledge he could think of: I &s;ay, when he found this to be true, his mind was filled with more dreadful apprehen&s;ions. Yet his heart did not relent and yield at all, and was &s;o far from becoming any more friendly to the prince, that it &s;welled with the mo&s;t horrid enmity again&s;t him; at the &s;ame time that he was told, and he was convinced in his con&s;cience, that the prince and his &s;on had acted a becoming part, and were amazingly kind to him, and that he was under the highe&s;t obligations immediately to &s;ubmit to them, and perfectly without any excu&s;e for not doing it. In this way of quarrelling directly with the prince and his &s;on, and ob&s;tinately refu&s;ing their kinde&s;t offers, he &s;pent many years; 'till the prince re&s;olved to wait on him no longer, and ordered him to be executed.</P>
<P>Now, is it not ea&s;y to determine in which part of this man's life he was mo&s;t guilty and vile?

<P>However, if the unregenerate &s;inner, as to his ab&s;olute character, is viewed in a ju&s;t light, which I &s;uppo&s;e is that in which he is &s;et in this and the foregoing &s;ections, I have an&s;wered the great end I propo&s;ed, whether the con&s;equence is thought to be ju&s;t, or not, with re&s;pect to his <HI>comparative</HI> guilt and vilene&s;s. I &s;aid what I did on this head in my &s;ection on means, with a de&s;ign to oppo&s;e that very notion of an awakened, convinced &s;inner which Mr. M. contends for, which is not much different, if at all, from that which Dr. Mayhew had: and which I knew was very common even among profe&s;&s;ed Calvini&s;ts; which I thought to be directly contrary to the truth, and of a very bad tendency. If therefore what I have &s;aid, fully and clearly expo&s;es and confutes this notion of the &s;inner's ab&s;olute character, I have obtained what I chiefly had in view, even tho' it &s;hould not be thought to be made evident beyond all di&s;pute that &s;uch an one is more guilty and vile than he could be, or than &s;inners generally are, in a &s;tate of ignorance and &s;ecurity.

<P>I con&s;idered the matter in this comparative view on purpo&s;e to &s;et the guilt and vilene&s;s of the awakened, convinced &s;inner, in a &s;triking light. I find Chri&s;t took this method to repre&s;ent the great guilt and vilene&s;s of the inhabitants of Capernaum, and convince them of it. He told them they were more guilty than the inhabitants of Sodom were. This was doubtle&s;s as &s;hocking and offen&s;ive to thou&s;ands, as the compari&s;on I have made, has been to Mr. M. or any one el&s;e.

<HEAD>SECT. IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>THE way which Mr. M. takes to evade &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, which were referred to in &s;upport of what he oppo&s;es, examined.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN my &s;ection on means I entered into no laboured proof of what I advanced with re&s;pect to the increa&s;e of the guilt of the awakened, convinced &s;inner, I only &s;tated the character of &s;uch in a few words here, having done it more largely in a former &s;ection,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 100. &amp;c.</NOTE> and then refer|red to &s;everal texts of &s;cripture, &s;uppo&s;ing they proved what I had a&s;|&s;erted beyond all controver&s;y, the &s;inner's character being allowed to be ju&s;tly &s;tated. In all I &s;ay on this head, I keep in view the &s;inner's character, as one who does "continue ob&s;tinately to oppo&s;e light and truth, and reject the offers of the go&s;pel."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 127.</NOTE> Mr. M. does not expre&s;sly deny this to be true of the awakened &s;inner. He indeed gives a quite different character of &s;uch, tho' he never once attempts to prove that mine is wrong, or that his is right. And as he builds all his oppo&s;iti|on to me on this mere &s;uppo&s;ition, without any proof, it appears to me a very &s;andy foundation, which is no way &s;ufficient to &s;upport the &s;u|per&s;tructure. He ought in the fir&s;t place to have excepted again&s;t the character I had given of the awakened &s;inner, and proved it not ju&s;t, and then e&s;tabli&s;hed his own; and this would have fini&s;hed the con|trover&s;y; for the whole debate between him and me, turns upon this, as it did in that between Dr. Mayhew and me, as has been before ob|&s;erved. It will appear, I tru&s;t, on examination, that what Mr. M. has &s;aid to &s;hew that the &s;criptures I adduced to prove my point are not to the purpo&s;e is grounded on a &s;uppo&s;ition that the character I have given of the convinced &s;inner is not true; and therefore that the mo&s;t he &s;ays here, as well as el&s;e where, is rather an unfair begging of the que&s;tion, than a confutation of what I have advanced.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture I mentioned are the following, "And this is the condemnation, that light is is come into the world, and men have loved darkne&s;s rather than light."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Joh.

<P><PB N="35" REF="011295_0021_0F869ED84A525580">
The general an&s;wer Mr. M. gives to this, is, that the&s;e &s;criptures &s;ay nothing of an awakened, convinced &s;inner; nothing of that light which is let into the con&s;cience, which he calls internal light: but have re|&s;pect only to what he calls external, objective light; &s;o are nothing to the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I thought the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages proved that oppo&s;ing and rejecting the light of the go&s;pel, and continuing impenitent, ob&s;tinate enemies to Chri&s;t, in the face of this light, and direct abu&s;e of it, was un&s;peakably the greate&s;t crime men can be guilty of; that this will be the principal ground of their condemnation, as that in which their guilt chiefly con|&s;i&s;ts. And that the awakened convinced &s;inner had much more of this light than others let into his con&s;cience, which he oppo&s;ed and rejected more directly, and with greater &s;trength and ob&s;tinacy, than he did the &s;mall degree of light which he had before; and much more again&s;t the dictates of his own con&s;cience. From this &s;tate of the ca&s;e, it ap|peared to me a plain and undeniable con&s;equence, that the awakened convinced &s;inner is more guilty and vile in the &s;tate and exerci&s;es of his mind than when he was ignorant and &s;ecure. And it appears in the &s;ame light to me now. If &s;inning again&s;t and oppo&s;ing the light of the go&s;pel is the chief aggravation of all &s;in, and that in which per&s;ons guilt under the go&s;pel &s;ummarily con&s;i&s;ts; then he who &s;ins again&s;t the greate&s;t and cleare&s;t light, and that mo&s;t directly, and with the greate&s;t degree of oppo&s;ition of heart, mu&s;t be the greate&s;t &s;inner. I &s;ee not that the di&s;tinction which Mr. M. makes between external, objective light, and internal light, a light in the judgment and con&s;cience, is any thing to his purpo&s;e. If two men are under the &s;ame external revela|tion; but one has &s;pecial pains taken with him to inculcate the truth revealed, by which his judgment and con&s;cience is convinced, while the other has really no more light in his judgment and con&s;cience, than if no revelation had been made: if the chief of their guilt lies in oppo|&s;ing and rejecting the light of this revelation, &s;urely he who has &s;o much the mo&s;t light and advantage, mu&s;t be un&s;peakably the greate&s;t &s;inner; while he continues wholly to oppo&s;e and reject it all. The wickedne&s;s of the latter, his want of love to the truth and oppo&s;ition of heart to it, keeps the light which is &s;et before him wholly out of his mind and con|&s;cience, and this will be the chief matter of his condemnation. The other would have continued as blind and ignorant as he, had not light been forced into his con&s;cience by &s;ome extraordinary means, which he now hates and oppo&s;es in a manner and degree, which the latter has no opportunity to do.</P>
<P>And now who can be at a lo&s;s which is the greate&s;t &s;inner? Mr. M. repre&s;ents the &s;ecure &s;inner as very criminal in &s;inning again&s;t the light of his con&s;cience, and by this means, <HI>wa&s;ting his con&s;cience,</HI> as he ex|pre&s;&s;es it: and &s;peaks of this as the great aggravation of all crimes.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 30.</NOTE> This is as really <HI>internal</HI> light as that of the awakened, convinced &s;in|ner; it being of the &s;ame nature and kind, and all the difference is in the degree of light. And if &s;inning again&s;t the former is a great crime;
<PB N="36" REF="011295_0022_0F869ED89DE84BB8">
yea, that in which the guilt of the &s;ecure &s;inner, who goes on in open wickedne&s;s, chiefly con&s;i&s;ts; then &s;urely the latter is a greater &s;inner than the former in proportion to the greater degree of light of con&s;ci|ence which he &s;ins again&s;t. It would be &s;trange indeed, if &s;inning a|gain&s;t, and oppo&s;ing a &s;mall degree of light of con&s;cience, &s;hould be very criminal, even the greate&s;t of all crimes; but &s;inning again&s;t, and oppo&s;ing an immen&s;ely greater degree of light of con&s;cience, &s;hould be quite harmle&s;s and innocent. But &s;o it mu&s;t be, if there is any rea|&s;on in this di&s;tinction which Mr. M. makes. In making this di&s;tinc|tion he has flatly contradicted him&s;elf, as has been ob&s;erved: for he allows that oppo&s;ition to this &s;ame <HI>internal light</HI> and conviction of con|&s;cience in the unawakened &s;inner is the chief aggravation of his crimes. To be con&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf on this head, he mu&s;t hold that light and conviction of con&s;cience does in no ca&s;e aggravate the &s;ins of men; but he is the greate&s;t &s;inner who has the lea&s;t knowledge and under&s;tand|ing; and who&s;e judgment and con&s;cience dictates nothing at all with re&s;pect to what is right or wrong: and he is the lea&s;t guilty, or certain|ly not more, who has the mo&s;t under&s;tanding and light of con&s;cience, tho' he abu&s;es and &s;ins again&s;t it all.</P>
<P>Our Saviour &s;ays, "That &s;ervant which <HI>knew</HI> his Lord's will, and prepared not him&s;elf, neither did according to his will, &s;hall be beaten with many &s;tripes.

XII. 47, 48.</NOTE> It would be a f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rced con&s;truction of the&s;e words indeed, to &s;ay that the meaning is not, that he who actually knows what God requires and neglects to do it in op|po&s;ition to his judgment and con&s;cience is mo&s;t guilty, and &s;hall be beaten with many &s;tripes; but he who is under advantages to know, but does not really know any thing about his Lord's will, &s;hall be bea|ten with few &s;tripes. It is true that he who is under advantages to know the will of God, and yet knows it not, is more guilty and wor|thy of a greater puni&s;hment, if he acts contrary to his will, than he who was under no advantages, and had no opportunity to know. Yea, the latter is not guilty at all, &s;o does not things worthy of any &s;tripes; becau&s;e in this ca&s;e his ignorance is properly <HI>invincible.</HI> Therefore our Saviour has no reference to &s;uch a ca&s;e. But by him that knew not his Lord's will and yet did things worthy of &s;tripes, he mu&s;t mean one who is under advantages to know at lea&s;t in &s;ome degree and yet does not know. And by him that knew his Lords will, he means one that really and actually, knew it; that is, has internal light, conviction and &s;en&s;ibility of con&s;cience. He then who &s;ins again&s;t this light is the greate&s;t criminal; and the greater is the degree of this light and knowledge, the more guilty and vile he is.</P>
<P>Mr. M's di&s;tinction therefore is not only contrary to all rea&s;on and comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">&s;e; but directly contrary to the&s;e words of our Saviour. He who actually knows his Lord's will, let his light and knowledge come how it will, whether in a miraculous way, or by a &s;tanding ex|ternal revelation; and whether he was brought to under&s;tand this by &s;ome extraordinary providence which awakened his attention and rou&s;ed

his con&s;cience, or by the influence of the holy Spirit: I &s;ay let his light and conviction of con&s;cience come in either of the&s;e ways, or in any other, if he does not act according to his knowledge, but neglects to come up to the dictates of his con&s;cience, this light and knowledge un&s;peakably aggravates his guilt.</P>
<P>BUT let us hear what Mr. M. has to &s;ay to vindicate his di&s;tinction, and &s;hew that, tho' <HI>external light,</HI> does greatly aggravate the guilt of &s;inners under the go&s;pel; yet <HI>internal light of an awakened con&s;cience</HI> does not. He &s;ays, <Q>They do e&s;&s;entially and &s;pecifically differ, the one is external, objectively &s;et before the mind; the other is inter|nal and mental. The former is liable to be utterly rejected with contempt, without any influence upon the con&s;cience or life. The latter is received into the mind, and allowed by the author in this debate, to have great influence on both, to rai&s;e conviction, and excite reformation and amendment of life, to the highe&s;t degree the unre|generate are capable of by the common influence of the holy Spirit. And therefore to argue from the one to the other, as if they were the &s;ame, the rea&s;oning mu&s;t needs be inconclu&s;ive.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 16, 17.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Here are two differences mentioned, which he calls "e&s;&s;ential and &s;pecifical." The fir&s;t is, "One is external&mdash;the other is internal and mental." How this difference &s;hould make any odds in favor of the latter I can not imagine. To &s;uppo&s;e it does is contrary to all rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e, and to the words of Chri&s;t ju&s;t quoted; as well as di|rectly contrary to him&s;elf: for he allows that &s;ins again&s;t the light and dictates of con&s;cience, are above all others aggravated, as has been ob|&s;erved: but this light is as "internal and mental" as any can be.</P>
<P>As to the other difference, if by being "received into the mind," he means any thing incon&s;i&s;tent with rejecting and oppo&s;ing the truth with contempt, and oppo&s;ite to this, as it is plain that he does, in that he &s;ets the one in oppo&s;ition to the other; then in&s;tead of proving any thing, he only begs the que&s;tion in di&s;pute, and &s;uppo&s;es that this light reforms the &s;inner, &s;o that, on the whole, his character is really mended, and that the mind, or heart truly conforms and &s;ubmits to it in its exerci&s;es. This is the only que&s;tion in di&s;pute; and if this mu&s;t be taken for granted, the di&s;pute is at an end. Mr. M. has really begged the que&s;tion in di&s;pute, thro' his whole book, by &s;uch repre&s;entations as the&s;e, and tho&s;e which are more gro&s;sly fal&s;e, without ever attempting to prove that they are ju&s;t. Let his book be &s;tripped of this di&s;gui&s;e, and mo&s;t he &s;ays would appear in its true weakne&s;s. Let Mr. M. or any of his ad|herents prove, what he here and every where &s;uppo&s;es and takes for granted, and the debate will be fini&s;hed; for this is really the only thing in di&s;pute. Mr. M. here &s;ays, I allow what he calls "internal light," to have great influence. It is true; but the influence I allow, is di|rectly contrary to that which he &s;peaks of; viz. That it is the occa&s;ion of exciting direct oppo&s;ition and enmity again&s;t God and Chri&s;t, and of a per&s;on's acting more again&s;t the light and dictates of his own con&s;ci|ence, in neglecting and ob&s;tinately refu&s;ing to do his Lord's will, of which he has a thou&s;and times more clear and exten&s;ive knowledge,
<PB N="38" REF="011295_0023_0F869EDCF4E9FD70">
than the ignorant, &s;ecure &s;inner. What Mr. M. means, by internal light having "great influence on the con&s;cience, I am at a lo&s;s. He does not mean that it <HI>inlightens</HI> the con&s;cience; for this would be only &s;aying that light in the con&s;cience, is light in the con&s;cience; for inter|nal light, is the con&s;cience inlightened. This therefore would be only &s;aying nothing; or if it is &s;aying &s;omething, it is nothing to his pur|po&s;e. If by "influence upon the con&s;cience," he means any influence by which the heart, or will does in any degree become pliable and &s;ub|mit to the truth, and obey it; I am &s;ure I do not, nor ever did "allow" this. Nor had he any right to take it for granted.</P>
<P>From this difference which he makes, he infers, "that to argue from the one to the other, <HI>as if they were the &s;ame,</HI> the rea&s;oning mu&s;t needs be inconclu&s;ive." It is granted they are not the &s;ame: There is a dif|ference: I do not "argue from the one to the other, as if they were the &s;ame: But the argument is from the le&s;s to the greater If this is the condemnation, if this is the great crime for which per&s;ons under the go&s;pel will be condemned, that light is come into the world in an ex|ternal revelation, and they have hated and oppo&s;ed it; then they into who&s;e minds and con&s;ciences this light is made to &s;hine, &s;o that they have a thou&s;and times more knowledge of the revealed truth than o|thers; and hate and oppo&s;e it more in proportion; are &s;inners above all others; and their condemnation will be proportionably greater.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">But after all, I would ob&s;erve that if what Mr. M. &s;ays in this ar|gument was well grounded, and the di&s;tinction he makes between &s;in|ning again&s;t and abu&s;ing external light, and internal and mental, had any rea&s;on in it, and was to the purpo&s;e, (which I think appears to be far otherwi&s;e) yet before he has done he demoli&s;hes all he has &s;aid here by declaring that they to whom our Saviour &s;poke were awakened, re|formed &s;inners.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 34, 35.</NOTE> by this he has given up the whole of this pretended argument, having flatly contradicted what he &s;o much in&s;i&s;ted upon here, and in this he has the hi&s;tory of the evangeli&s;ts on his &s;ide too.

<P>HAVING con&s;idered his general an&s;wer to &s;hew that the&s;e &s;criptures are not to my purpo&s;e, which he often repeats; I &s;hall take notice of &s;ome other things which he &s;ays with re&s;pect to each of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, in order to evade the force of them.</P>
<P>He &s;ays of the fir&s;t, "This is the condemnation, &amp;c." <Q>Not a word of an awakened, reformed &s;inner in the text and context, nothing of internal light, or &s;en&s;ibility of con&s;cience, or any of the effects that might imply it.

They are &s;aid to practi&s;e evil, i. e. &s;o as the reformed &s;inner does not, and to &s;hun the light, le&s;t their evil deed &s;hould be reproved, and they called to part with them.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 9.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>I have ju&s;t now &s;hewn that the &s;trength of my argument from this text does not depend upon its having a direct and immediate reference

to an awakened &s;inner; but on &s;uppo&s;ition an unawakened &s;inner only is meant, the argument from &s;uch an one, to an awakened &s;inner, is very &s;trong, if the latter hates and oppo&s;es the light he has, as much, and more than the former. That he does not Mr. M. here takes for granted; &s;o that he begs the que&s;tion again here, as he does from be|ginning to end.</P>
<P>But let us &s;ee how he proves that the&s;e words have no reference to an awakened &s;inner. He &s;ays "the character here given of tho&s;e &s;poken of is quite the rever&s;e of the awakened, reformed &s;inner, they are &s;aid to <HI>practi&s;e evil,</HI> i. e. &s;o as the reformed &s;inner does not." But of this he has not given the lea&s;t proof unle&s;s it be in the repetition of the words REFORMED SINNER, which is a very ambiguous phra&s;e, as Mr. M. has u&s;ed it here, and every where el&s;e. There is indeed no &s;uch reformed, unregenerate &s;inner as he here &s;uppo&s;es, who cannot be &s;aid to do evil, and hate the light, and who&s;e character is directly the re|ver&s;e of this. There is no &s;uch unregenerate &s;inner mentioned in the bible from beginning to end; &s;uch a character is the invention of Mr. M. and a thou&s;and others, in direct contradiction to the whole of di|vine revelation. It is directly contrary to this pa&s;&s;age now under con|&s;ideration. Our Saviour &s;peaks of two &s;orts of per&s;ons, of di&s;tinct and directly oppo&s;ite characters, viz. They who do evil and hate the light; and they who love and practi&s;e the truth, who&s;e deeds are wrought in God. And he &s;o &s;peaks of the&s;e, as to exclude any middle character between the&s;e two extremes; and his words &s;trongly imply that there can be no &s;uch per&s;on. With what face then can Mr. M. dre&s;s up an awakened &s;inner, &s;o as not to belong to either of the&s;e characters in which Chri&s;t evidently includes all mankind!</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, Chri&s;t is here &s;peaking expre&s;sly of the condemnation that &s;hall come on all unbelievers; &s;o on all who do not know and love the truth; which appears from the foregoing words with which the&s;e are connected. "He that believeth not, is <HI>condemned</HI> already. And <HI>this</HI> is the <HI>condemnation.</HI>" &amp;c. Mr. M. it &s;eems, has found a &s;et of per&s;ons who, though they do not believe on Chri&s;t, yet are dre&s;&s;ed in &s;uch fine colours, that they will not fall under this condemnation! They are certainly a &s;ort of creatures which he who &s;poke the&s;e words knew no|thing of.&mdash;And it is mo&s;t certain the bible knows nothing about the&s;e poor, harmle&s;s, penitent, reformed, humble, obedient, unregenerate &s;inners, who do not hate the truth, nor do evil. Nor do any &s;uch exi&s;t in nature, as &s;uch a character is the mo&s;t perfect contradiction, and ne|ce&s;&s;arily de&s;troys it&s;elf.

<P>I PROCEED to examine what he &s;ays on the next &s;cripture mentioned; "If I had not come and &s;poken unto them, they had not had &s;in." I &s;uppo&s;e our Saviour in the&s;e words repre&s;ents the &s;in the Jews were guilty of in hating and rejecting him, when he had come and &s;poken to them, and exhibited his character and the evidence of his divine mi&s;|&s;ion in a clear and &s;triking light, to be un&s;peakably greater than all
<PB N="40" REF="011295_0024_0F869EDD033C2BB8">
their other &s;ins could be, had he not thus come and &s;poken to them. This &s;in was &s;o amazingly aggravated, that their other &s;ins, however great in them&s;elves, were light and as nothing, and not to be mentioned in compari&s;on with this. I thought it hence followed with undeniable evidence that the awakened, convinced &s;inner, who, under the full blaze of light let into his mind and con&s;cience, continued to hate and reject Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is un&s;peakably more guilty and vile than he was in a &s;tate of ignorance and blindne&s;s when he did not &s;ee, and &s;o could not hate and oppo&s;e Chri&s;t as he does now.</P>
<P>To this Mr. M. objects two things. One is, that the light here &s;po|ken of as re&s;i&s;ted is "merely external, and has no nece&s;&s;ary relation to, or connexion with an awakened, reformed &s;inner."</P>
<P>This has been ju&s;t now con&s;idered, as his general objection to all the pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture now under con&s;ideration. And I hope it has been &s;ufficiently &s;hewn, how weak and groundle&s;s this is.</P>
<P>Another thing he &s;ays to &s;hew this text is not to my purpo&s;e is, that according to our Saviour's own account, the Jews of whom the&s;e words are &s;poken, "were in a &s;tate and temper of their minds, previous to their rejecting the go&s;pel, more wicked than the inhabitants of Tyre and Sidon, or even Sodom it&s;elf."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 10.</NOTE> This he thinks is evident in that he &s;ays, the latter "would have repented by the &s;ame means, which the former rejected. Hence he infers that if they were more wicked than the inhabitants of Sodom, antecedent to their rejecting Chri&s;t, this their wickedne&s;s could not with any propriety be &s;aid to be little or nothing, compared with what they were now guilty of. Therefore that this cannot be the meaning of our Saviour.</P>
<P>To this I an&s;wer in the fir&s;t place, that it is by no means evident that when Chri&s;t &s;peaks of the&s;e cities wherein mo&s;t of his mighty works were done, as more guilty than Sodom, he has re&s;pect to the &s;ins they were guilty of antecedent to his coming and preaching to them, &amp;c. but the contrary is mo&s;t evident. Therefore his con&s;equence, has no foundation; &s;o comes to nothing. But of this I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak more particularly pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>In the next place, I &s;ay, if what he &s;uppo&s;es were true, his con&s;e|quence does by no means follow. Tho' the Jews were wor&s;e than So|dom, antecedent to Chri&s;t's coming and preaching to them, it does not follow that they were not immen&s;ely more guilty, in con&s;equence of the vi&s;it Chri&s;t made them, than they were before, tho' very guilty then. Their guilt might be va&s;tly greater than that of Sodom; and yet they might be put into &s;uch circum&s;tances, and have &s;o much greater light, &amp;c. as to increa&s;e their guilt amazingly; &s;o as that in the com|pari&s;on, their former guilt, &s;inks, as it were into nothing, as not to be mentioned with the latter. This is the very light in which this &s;ame thing is &s;et in other pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture. "For if the word &s;poken by angels was &s;tedfa&s;t, and every tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and di&s;obedience received a ju&s;t recompence of reward; how &s;hall we e&s;cape, if we neglect &s;o great &s;alvation, which at fir&s;t began to be &s;poken by the Lord!"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb.

expre&s;&s;ion greater than any di&s;obedience under the Mo&s;aic di&s;pen|&s;ation, or before Chri&s;t came.

"See that ye refu&s;e not him that &s;peaketh: for if they e&s;caped not who refu&s;ed him that &s;pake on earth, <HI>much more</HI> &s;hall not we e&s;cape, if we turn away from him that &s;peaketh from heaven."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap.

<P>St. Paul, in order to &s;et forth the excellence and glory of the go&s;pel, as far exceeding the glory of the legal di&s;pen&s;ation under Mo&s;es, &s;ays, "For even that which was made glorious, <HI>had no glory</HI> in this re&s;pect, by rea&s;on of the glory that excelleth."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. III. 10.</NOTE> This expre&s;&s;ion is exactly parallel with the words of Chri&s;t under con&s;ideration, taken in the &s;en&s;e I put upon them. And it is to be ob&s;erved, that if the di&s;pen&s;ation opened by Chri&s;t &s;o much exceeded the former di&s;pen&s;ation in glory, that it may be &s;aid to have no glory, in compari&s;on with this; then it may be with as great propriety affirmed of the &s;ins under the&s;e different di&s;pen&s;ations, that &s;ins under the former, are no &s;ins, have no guilt and criminalne&s;s, in compari&s;on with &s;ins under the latter. For de&s;pi&s;ing and rebelling again&s;t the latter, is more criminal than de&s;pi&s;ing the for|mer, in proportion to the greater glory of the latter.</P>
<P>The hu&s;bandmen to whom the hou&s;holder let out his vineyard, were very criminal in abu&s;ing the &s;ervants he &s;ent to them to receive his due of the fruit; and proceeding to kill &s;ome of them. But how much more criminal and guilty were they in &s;eizing and putting to death his only &s;on, when he was &s;ent to them! This as it were, &s;wallowed up all their former crimes, &s;o that they are hardly to be mentioned in compa|ri&s;on with this. In what words could the greatne&s;s of this crime be better repre&s;ented, than by &s;uch an expre&s;&s;ion as this, "If he had not &s;ent his only &s;on, they had not had &s;in; their guilt would have been little or nothing compared with what it is now: For now they have &s;een, and murdered <HI>his only &s;on.</HI>" It is common to repre&s;ent the greatne&s;s of a crime, by &s;aying, Such or &s;uch a &s;in is nothing to this. Or all the wickedne&s;s he was guilty of before is nothing to this. And is not Chri&s;t's expre&s;&s;ion exactly parallel to this? How then can we be at a lo&s;s about the meaning of it?</P>
<P>This does indeed &s;et Je&s;us Chri&s;t in a very grand light; that all the &s;ins in the world &s;hould be nothing to that of rejecting and hating him, when he comes in per&s;on, and &s;peaks and offers him&s;elf. It is impo&s;|&s;ible that they who have as low and mean notions of him, and as high ones of them&s;elves as the Jews had, &s;hould under&s;tand them. No won|der then if all &s;uch join with Mr. M. and &s;ay, "Since this <HI>can't</HI> be the meaning, another <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be &s;ought."</P>
<P>When we con&s;ider the high and grand character of Je&s;us Chri&s;t the SON OF GOD; his amazing conde&s;cention and grace in becoming incarnate and living among the Jews&mdash;Their high expectations and
<PB N="42" REF="011295_0025_0F869EDDBAEDFBB8">
de&s;ires of the coming of the Me&s;&s;iah&mdash;the excellence and amiablene&s;s of his character&mdash;how abundant, clear and plain his public in&s;tructions were&mdash;and what full, bright and awakening evidence he gave, by his &s;tupendous works, that he was indeed the SON OF GOD: I &s;ay, when we well con&s;ider all this, and much more that might be men|tioned, the crime of hating and rejecting him, in tho&s;e circum&s;tances, will I am confident ri&s;e &s;o high in our view, that there will appear no difficulty in under&s;tanding the words under con&s;ideration in the &s;en&s;e I have put upon them; and it will, I doubt not, appear that to &s;ay that this crime does not ri&s;e &s;o high above all others, as to ju&s;tify &s;uch an expre&s;&s;ion, thus under&s;tood; and on this ground to &s;eek another mean|ing, is very di&s;honorable to Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>In this light therefore I think I have good ground to look on what Mr. M. has &s;aid here; e&s;pecially if we con&s;ider, what is the meaning which he has "&s;ought," and found. This I will give in his own words. <Q>And &s;ince this can't be the meaning (i. e. the meaning I had put upon the words) another <HI>mu&s;t be &s;ought.</HI> Which is plainly this, viz. They had not had that &s;in of rejecting the clear light of the evidence of the divine mi&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t, and &s;o of the truth of the go&s;pel.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 10.</NOTE></Q> That is, if Chri&s;t had not come and given them opportunity to reject him, they would not have been guilty of rejecting him. This is much the &s;ame as if he had &s;aid, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">if they had not been guilty of this &s;in, they would not in fact have been guilty of it. Who can think that our divine teacher, who never &s;poke a word but to &s;ome good purpo&s;e, took pains repeatedly to inculcate this, which every one knew, without his mentioning it; and if they did not, it is a matter of no importance; &s;o that to a&s;&s;ert it is but mere trifling: Who, I &s;ay, can imagine this? If Mr. M. will find another &s;uch in&s;tance in the whole bible, or in any author of tolerable &s;en&s;e, he may be excu&s;ed. He was &s;urely driven to a hard &s;hift that when he <HI>&s;ought</HI> a meaning to the&s;e words, he could find no better, if he rejected that which I had given.</P>
<P>BUT he goes on to &s;ay, <Q>They indeed did it in their hearts; but it lay concealed, hid under the cloak of high preten&s;ions to &s;anc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ity: But when they acted it out, the cloak fell off, and their wickedne&s;s appeared to all the world. This acting out the wickedne&s;s of their hearts, we readily grant, was an aggravation of their &s;in. But how comes it to pa&s;s, that all their &s;infulne&s;s of heart and life</Q> (i. e. of the inhabitants of Chorazin, &amp;c.) <Q>whereby they were more vile than the idolatrous heathen, and mo&s;t abominable Sodomites, is little or no|thing, compared with acting it out in this particular? Is the fountain nothing to the &s;treams? The cau&s;e nothing to the effect? Is not this to invert the known and e&s;tabli&s;hed rules of rea&s;oning.</Q></P>
<P>Here he &s;peaks of the&s;e Jews, as covering all their wickedne&s;s under the cloak of high preten&s;ions to &s;anctity; and in the next breath &s;peaks of their wickedne&s;s of life. So here are a &s;et of men, who are guilty of great &s;infulne&s;s of life, i. e. outward, open wickedne&s;s; and yet at the &s;ame time hide all their wickedne&s;s of heart under high preten&s;ions to &s;anctity. A &s;trange &s;ort of people indeed! It is to be al&s;o remem|bered
<PB N="43" REF="011295_0025_0F869EDDBAEDFBB8">
that he el&s;e where &s;peaks of the&s;e very per&s;ons is "<HI>reformed</HI> &s;in|ners, who were awakened, brought to con&s;ider, and in a mea&s;ure to <HI>amend their lives.</HI>"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 34, 35.</NOTE> What then does he here mean by <HI>&s;infulne&s;s of life?</HI> But if they were never &s;o &s;inful in their lives, to what purpo&s;e is it men|tioned here, when he is &s;peaking only of &s;infulne&s;s of heart, of the "foun|tain" not of the "&s;treams?" Is &s;infulne&s;s of life the fountain, not the &s;treams; the cau&s;e, and not the effect?</P>
<P>As to his two que&s;tions here, the fir&s;t has been an&s;wered already. Let the&s;e be as &s;inful in heart and life as Mr. M. &s;uppo&s;es, &s;o that "they were more vile than the mo&s;t abominable Sodomites, antecedent to their having opportunity to &s;in again&s;t, hate and reject Chri&s;t: Yet their acting out the wickedne&s;s of their hearts in this particular way, had un&s;peakably more guilt and vilene&s;s in it, than all their other &s;ins put together. To &s;ay the contrary, is to &s;peak di&s;honorably of Chri&s;t, and contrary to what he has &s;aid not only here, but el&s;ewhere, and to other pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, as has been &s;hewn.</P>
<P>As to the other que&s;tion, "Is the fountain nothing to the &s;treams," &amp;c. I an&s;wer, I &s;ee not what relation this que&s;tion has to that which is now in di&s;pute. What Chri&s;t &s;peaks of in the words before us are the ex|erci&s;es and exertions of wickedne&s;s in hating and rejecting him; and the&s;e he &s;ays are &s;o greatly aggravated, that all the exerci&s;es and acts of wickedne&s;s which they would, or could be guilty of, had he not come and &s;poken to them, had been light, and as nothing, compared with the&s;e: So that what it here &s;aid has no relation to wickedne&s;s of heart, con&s;idered as di&s;tinct from all exerci&s;es of every kind, and antecedent to &s;uch; if there is indeed any &s;uch wickedne&s;s of heart in nature. In a word, if by the "fountain," he means that &s;infulne&s;s of heart and life whereby the Jews were more vile than the idolatrous heathen; then by fountain and &s;treams, cau&s;e and effect he means the &s;ame thing; or rather has no meaning at all Their &s;infulne&s;s of heart and life by which they hated and oppo&s;ed Chri&s;t, was no more the &s;treams from the fountain, than that wickedne&s;s of heart and life by which they were more vile than the idolatrous heathen; and the former was as much the fountain and cau&s;e as the latter. But if by fountain and cau&s;e here Mr. M. means the wickedne&s;s of the heart di&s;tinct from all exerci&s;es, and antecedent to them, his que&s;tion is quite foreign to the matter under con&s;ideration; as the words of Chri&s;t have no relation to this; but to &s;inful exerci&s;es of heart in hating the Father and him. This he &s;ays was &s;uch a high degree of wickedne&s;s that all &s;ins they could have been guilty of were as nothing to this.</P>
<P>His next words are, <Q>But what increa&s;es my &s;urprize is, that in the pa&s;&s;ages above quoted from the author, he &s;eems to argue that the &s;in|ner's being re&s;trained from acting out the wickedne&s;s of the heart in <HI>overt acts,</HI> is as nothing; but what he is in his heart, is all. Whatever particular ways of &s;in he has for&s;aken, &amp;c. yet on the whole he is more vile, &amp;c. And <HI>now,</HI> all the wickedne&s;s of the heart, whereby the &s;inner is di&s;po&s;ed to the act, if occa&s;ion offers, is little

or nothing, if the <HI>overt act</HI> is re&s;trained. Does the tables being turn|ed, really change the nature of things?</Q></P>
<P>REPLY, Mr. M. here puts the charge upon him&s;elf, and is the &s;ole cau&s;e of increa&s;ing his own &s;urprize, and of the contradiction he would fa&s;ten upon me, by u&s;ing the words <HI>overt acts,</HI> in an indeterminate, con|fu&s;ed manner, and &s;o as to mean one thing in one &s;entence, and quite another in the next I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by <HI>overt acts</HI> are meant external acts of &s;in, in di&s;tinction from the voluntary exerci&s;es of the heart, I have &s;aid that whatever <HI>overt acts</HI> the &s;inner is re&s;trained from, he may notwith&s;tand|ing be more guilty and vile in acting out the wickedne&s;s of his heart, in hating and oppo&s;ing Chri&s;t, under great light and conviction of con|&s;cience, than he was when guilty of the&s;e <HI>overt acts,</HI> in a &s;tate of igno|rance and &s;ecurity. In this &s;en&s;e Mr. M. u&s;es the&s;e words in the fir&s;t &s;entence, unle&s;s he abu&s;es me, and him&s;elf too. But where is the in|con&s;i&s;tence with this, in repre&s;enting the great &s;in of the Jews as con|&s;i&s;ting in hating and oppo&s;ing Je&s;us Chri&s;t; &s;o that all their <HI>overt acts</HI> of &s;in, that they had been guilty of, or could be, without this, were as nothing to it: Is not this perfectly con&s;i&s;tent? Every reader who has &s;en&s;e and attention enough to read two plain &s;entences, mu&s;t know it is. But Mr M. has u&s;ed the words <HI>overt act</HI> in the la&s;t &s;entence, in quite another &s;en&s;e, as meaning all the exerci&s;es of the mind whatever, in di&s;tinction from the dormant principles of the heart, antecedent to all thought, motion or exerci&s;e, "whereby the &s;inner is di&s;po&s;ed to act, if occa&s;ion offers." Now I have &s;aid nothing about this, thro' the whole &s;ection he is remarking upon. I &s;peak of no wickedne&s;s of heart, but what con&s;i&s;ts in thought and voluntary exerci&s;e; or the neglect of pro|per exerci&s;e, when occa&s;ion offers: And therefore make no compari&s;on between the one and the other. It is Mr. M. therefore that has "turn|ed the tables" and confu&s;ed and &s;urprized him&s;elf and his leader, with his own mi&s;take and inaccuracy.</P>
<P>Before I leave this pa&s;&s;age, I would ob&s;erve that Mr. M. by repre&s;ent|ing the &s;treams as nothing to the fountain, meaning by &s;treams overt acts of &s;in, has in a great mea&s;ure &s;poiled his <HI>reformed &s;inner,</HI> about whom he &s;ays &s;o much, laying a mighty &s;tre&s;s upon his external reformation, as being &s;ufficient to counterbalance all the greater guilt he contracts by his oppo&s;ition of heart to immen&s;ely more light and conviction than he had. This external reformation now dwindles into little or nothing compared with the fountain of corruption that remains as great, and with as much &s;trength as ever. If he had kept this in view every where, we &s;hould not have heard &s;o much of his poor, trembling, <HI>re|formed &s;inner;</HI> nor &s;o much &s;aid in his favor, how oppo&s;ite &s;oever is his heart to Je&s;us Chri&s;t and the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>I COME now to con&s;ider the other pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture, which I re|ferred to in &s;upport of what I had advanced. It is this, "Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein mo&s;t of his mighty works were done, <HI>becau&s;e they repented not.</HI> Wo unto thee, Chorazin, Wo unto thee, Beth|&s;aida; for if the mighty works which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in &s;ackcloth

and a&s;hes. But I &s;ay unto you, it &s;hall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you. And thou Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, &s;halt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. But I &s;ay unto you, that it &s;hall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee."</P>
<P>Mr. M &s;ays, Chri&s;t has re&s;pect here only to the wickedne&s;s and hard|ne&s;s of heart th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> inhabitants of the&s;e cities were found guilty of ante|cedent to his preaching and working miracles among them; by which they had rendered them&s;elves harder and more unimpre&s;&s;ible by the&s;e powerful means, than the inhabitants of Tyre and Sidon were. This he thinks to be certain from Chri&s;t's telling them, that, if the &s;ame means had been u&s;ed with the latter, they would have repented. And he hence concludes al&s;o, that the repentance here &s;poken of, for the ne|glect of which he upbraids the&s;e cities, and which he &s;ays the Tyrians and Sidonians would have been brought to by the&s;e means, was not true repentance, or a repentance which implies any real love to God and hatred of &s;in, and turning of the heart from it; but what he calls "a legal repentance, or repentance on natural principles." He thinks this is certain, "&s;eeing our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour well knew, that neither the&s;e means, which they enjoyed, nor any other means, could ever bring them to a &s;aving repentance, without an almighty power exerted in giving a new heart,"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 12.</NOTE> He therefore gives the &s;en&s;e of this pa&s;&s;age in the following words. <Q>As if Chri&s;t had &s;aid, You have by your own wickedne&s;s wa&s;ted natural con&s;cience, &s;inned away your <HI>moral &s;en&s;e,</HI> and rendered your&s;elves more unimpre&s;&s;ible by the &s;ame motives and arguments to repentance, &s;et in the &s;ame advantageous light, than the idolatrous Tyrians and Sidonians and therefore on that &s;ingle account, your &s;tate is more wicked than theirs, and you are ju&s;tly expo&s;ed to a more aggravated condemnation in the day of judgment than they.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 12, 13.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Upon this, I take leave to ob&s;erve the following things, 1 It is &s;trange and unaccountable indeed, if Chri&s;t here &s;harply reproves tho inhabitants of the&s;e cities, for not repenting with a legal repentance, which implies in it no true regard to his character or oppo&s;ition of heart to &s;in; and &s;ays not a word to them for their not coming to that re|pentance which John Bapti&s;t, his harbinger and he him&s;elf, from the beginning of his mini&s;try, had been inculcating, and calling them to. John Bapti&s;t had &s;ounded an alarm among them all, and loudly preach|ed "repentance for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins." This was certainly &s;aving repentance. And when John was put in pri&s;on, "Je&s;us came into Galilee (to the&s;e very cities) preaching the go&s;pel of the kingdom of God, and &s;aying, The time is fulfiled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: <HI>repent ye, and believe go&s;pel.</HI>"<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mark I. 14, 15.</NOTE> Chri&s;t had been calling and urging them to true repentance in all his teaching, and by all his mi|racles. And it is perfectly unaccountable and a&s;toni&s;hing, if he now drops this demand, and &s;ays not a word to them by way of reproof for not hearkening to his calls and demands, and to what was the language
<PB N="46" REF="011295_0027_0F869EDF3A95A670">
of all his mighty works; but reproves and upbraids them &s;everely for &s;omething el&s;e, which he never expre&s;sly mentioned before, or called them to, but only as it is implied in true repentance; and which im|plies in it no true regard and obedience to him, and leaves them as re|ally in a &s;tate of mi&s;ery and ruin as ever.</P>
<P N="2">2. The rea&s;on which Mr. M. gives why our Saviour cannot mean &s;aving repentance, is really as much of a rea&s;on why he cannot mean legal repentance; for he holds that this is not effected merely by means, but the influences of the Spirit of God, are as nece&s;&s;ary to bring men to legal repentance, as they are to bring them to &s;aving repentance. And he repre&s;ents that a very dangerous and hurtful doctrine, that teaches that legal repentance is not produced by the Spirit of God. Mr. M. mu&s;t either e&s;pou&s;e this <HI>new divinity,</HI> or his argument will prove that Chri&s;t did not mean legal repentance, for according to his own doctrine, "Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour infinitely well knew, that neither the&s;e means they enjoyed, nor any other means could ever bring them to" legal repentance, "without an almighty power exerted" by the com|mon influences of the Spirit of God, in a work of awakening and con|viction. His argument therefore is good for nothing, or rather much wor&s;e than nothing; becau&s;e it proves too much: and he is guilty of gro&s;s &s;elf contradiction in u&s;ing it as he does.</P>
<P N="3">3.

What is now become of his argument to prove that the Jews were wor&s;e than the Sodomites "on this &s;ingle account" that they were not brought to legal repentance by Chri&s;t's preaching, &amp;c? He has quite confuted it him&s;elf, by declaring this was not true of them; but that they did in fact repent. And in this he is &s;upported by the hi&s;tory the evangeli&s;ts give of the matter.</P>
<P>He therefore has not hit on the true meaning of this pa&s;&s;age; and "another mu&s;t be &s;ought."&mdash;But I proceed to ob&s;erve,</P>

4. If the &s;en&s;e which he has put upon this pa&s;&s;age &s;hould be allowed to be true, however incon&s;i&s;tent it is with the evangeli&s;ts, and with him|&s;elf; yet it &s;tands full to the purpo&s;e for which I quoted it, viz. to prove that they are the mo&s;t guilty and vile who enjoy the mo&s;t light, and rebel again&s;t it. For if the&s;e Jews were wor&s;e than Sodom ante|cedent to Chri&s;t coming among them, their greater guilt did not con&s;i&s;t in their open profligacy and wickedne&s;s; for in this Sodom doubtle&s;s exceeded them: but in their abu&s;e of greater light and advantages, and by this means bringing them&s;elves into a more guilty, hardened &s;tate.</P>
<P>But as the ca&s;e &s;tands, and as Mr. M. &s;ays it in fact was, it is exactly to my purpo&s;e. Here is an in&s;tance of &s;inners "who were awakened, brought to con&s;ider and to amend their lives" who are declared by Chri&s;t him&s;elf to be more guilty and vile than the abandoned profli|gates of Sodom, purely becau&s;e they remained impenitent and rejected him, under all their awakenings, convictions and external reformations.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the&s;e cities had been for a long time thoroughly reformed from idolatry, to which their fathers were &s;o much given; and were punctual and zealous in attending the in&s;tituted duties of wor&s;hip and religion. They did not practi&s;e the abominable vices of Sodom. And they had been greatly alarmed and awakened and re|formed in their external conduct by the preaching of John. They flocked to him in crowds, and were baptized, confe&s;&s;ing their &s;ins, and earne&s;tly a&s;king the important que&s;tion "What &s;hall we do?" And when Chri&s;t came to preach among them, they flocked to him from all quarters, and heard with great attention, admiration and applau&s;e; "And Je&s;us returned in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ver of the Spirit into Galilee, and there went <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> fame of him through all the region round about. And he taught in their &s;ynagogues, being glorified of ALL."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luk. IV. 14, 15.</NOTE></P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> notwith&s;tanding all this, they did with one con&s;ent reject the me&s;&s;age that Chri&s;t brought to them, and refu&s;ed to repent and believe the go&s;pel. And for this impenitence and unbelief, per&s;i&s;ted in, under all this light, awakening, conviction and reformation, and while the&s;e mighty works were wrought in their &s;ight; for <HI>this,</HI> I &s;ay, Chri&s;t up|braids them, and tells them that "on this &s;ingle account" notwith|&s;tanding all their convictions, fears and reformations, and attending on his preaching with affection, admiration and applau&s;e, they were wor&s;e, more guilty and vile than open gro&s;s idolaters, or even Sodom it&s;elf: And not <Q>that they had by their own wickedne&s;s, wa&s;ted natural con|&s;cience, &s;inned away their <HI>moral &s;en&s;e,</HI> and rendered them&s;elves more unimpre&s;&s;ible by the &s;ame motives and arguments to repentance, &s;et in the &s;ame advantageous light, than the idolatrous Tyrians and Sidonians.</Q></P>
<P>This &s;aying of our Lord was doubtle&s;s very &s;hocking, offen&s;ive and provoking to the inhabitants of the&s;e cities; nothing could be more &s;o; e&s;pecially to the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, and to every one who had as favourable an opinion of the "awakened reformed &s;inner" who yet per&s;i&s;ts in impenitence, and ob&s;tinately rejects Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as Mr. M. has. And no wonder if on this occa&s;ion they mentioned all the dread|ful
<PB N="48" REF="011295_0028_0F869EE05D5D45E0">
ab&s;urdities of this principle, and uttered all the exclamations, that are found in Mr. M's book, or &s;omething like them. "Strange ab&s;ur|dity this! Strange divinity indeed! Nor is it in our power to doubt, that the grand enemy of the Me&s;&s;iah and precious &s;ouls, put his hearty AMEN to it. Thrice amazing"!!!</P>
<P>After all, I cannot think the inhabitants of Capernaum, &amp;c. came up to the character of the awakened, convinced &s;inner of which I &s;pake. They had not that degree of light, and were not &s;o fully convinced in their con&s;ciences that Je&s;us was the Chri&s;t; nor did they &s;o clearly &s;ee their inexcu&s;ablene&s;s in rejecting him, and the dreadful con&s;equences to them, &amp;c. as the awakened &s;inner does, of whom I &s;peak. But as &s;uch a &s;inner is as really an impenitent, as they were, and does as fully re|ject Je&s;us Chri&s;t as they did; and that under immen&s;ely greater light and conviction of con&s;cience than they had; <HI>how much more</HI> guilty is he than the Sodomites; or even than the inhabitants of Capernaum, who were them&s;elves &s;o much wor&s;e than tho&s;e of Sodom!</P>
<P>WHEN our Saviour &s;ays to Chorazin and Beth&s;aida, "If the mighty works which have been done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in &s;ackcloth and a&s;hes;" I &s;uppo&s;e we are not to under&s;tand him as a&s;&s;erting that this would certainly have been the effect of &s;uch means being u&s;ed with the inhabitants of the&s;e cities, as if he &s;pake in the character of the omni&s;cient God, as certain|ly knowing what in all ca&s;es would be. But he is here to be con&s;idered as &s;peaking as a man, (and he was no more than a man in their view to whom he &s;pake) and after the manner of men; viewing and judging of this matter according to human appearance and probability. As if he had &s;aid, "Who could have thought that you would not repent and believe the go&s;pel, before who&s;e eyes &s;uch mighty works have been done for your conviction. If &s;uch things had been done among men of the wor&s;t character, even the inhabitants of Tyre and Sidon, &s;urely they would have repented immediately. It would be natural to expect, and be confident that this would be the effect." If the words are un|der&s;tood in this &s;en&s;e, they will be very agreeable to &s;ome other pa&s;&s;ages in the bible "For he &s;aid, &s;urely they are my people, children that will not lie: &s;o he was their Saviour."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. LXIII. 8.</NOTE> Here God is repre&s;ented as putting confidence in his people, that they would be faithful to him, according to their profe&s;&s;ion, vows and engagements; and &s;o is repre|&s;ented as &s;peaking only after the manner of men; for as the omni&s;cient God, he knew they did lie, and would break all their promi&s;es. The following pa&s;&s;age, I think is exactly parallel to this under con&s;ideration.&mdash;"For thou art not &s;ent to a people of a &s;trange &s;peech and of an hard language, but to the hou&s;e of I&s;rael: not to many people of a &s;trange &s;peech, and an hard language, who&s;e words thou can&s;t not un|der&s;tand: <HI>&s;urely, had I &s;ent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee.</HI>"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ezek.

<P>Chri&s;t's de&s;ign was to repre&s;ent to them their folly and ob&s;tinacy in a way that was &s;uited to their conviction, and to &s;top their mouths. And what was better &s;uited to do it, than to ob&s;erve to them, the confidence

any one would have, before the trial, that tho&s;e, who in their view were the wor&s;t of men, and whom they held in the highe&s;t contempt and abhorrence, would have been brought to the deepe&s;t repentance, by the &s;ame means under which they had continued ob&s;tinately impenitent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></P>
<P>Before I leave this pa&s;&s;age, I would ob&s;erve, that our Saviour does not ground his a&s;&s;ertion that it &s;hould be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for the inhabitants of the&s;e Jewi&s;h cities, upon this, that the former would have repented, had the mighty works been done in them, which were done among the latter. This Mr. M. takes for granted in all he &s;ays; but I think without any rea|&s;on. If this had been the ca&s;e, the word would have been "<HI>Therefore</HI> I &s;ay unto you it &s;hall be more tolerable, &amp;c." and not "<HI>But</HI> I &s;ay unto you, &amp;c." Chri&s;t tells them that if the &s;ame means had been u&s;ed with the&s;e wicked cities, which the&s;e Jews did mo&s;t ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">minate and condemn, that had been u&s;ed with them, any one would be confident they would have repented; as be&s;t &s;uited to &s;trike conviction into their minds, and make them reflect on their own amazing unrea&s;onablene&s;s and ob&s;tina|cy. And then goes on to &s;ay, "But I &s;ay unto you, &amp;c." As if he had &s;aid, "But, be this as it will, whether they would have repented or not. I have one thing to &s;ay to you which you may depend upon, as infal|libly certain, However abominably vile and wicked you think the&s;e cities to be, you are much more guilty than they, and they &s;hall have a lighter puni&s;hment than you, when every thing &s;hall be adju&s;ted ac|cording to the truth.</P>
<P>But let it be remembered that whether I have given the true &s;en&s;e or not, it does not affect the matter in di&s;pute between Mr. M. and me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for be this as it will, it is certain the &s;en&s;e he has given, in order to oppo&s;e me, cannot be the right, which I conclude has been &s;ufficiently proved.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t text mentioned mu&s;t now be attended to. "The go&s;pel is a favour of death unto death, in them that peri&s;h"</P>
<P>I referred to this &s;cripture to prove that all means u&s;ed with &s;inners, all light and advantages they have had, and therefore, all light and conviction of con&s;cience, if they continue impenitent and peri&s;h, will turn again&s;t them and aggravate their condemnation: and &s;aid, <Q>con|&s;equently the more light and conviction men have, the more their attention is awakened to the things of the go&s;pel, and the more means they attend upon, and are u&s;ed with them, while they con|tinue ob&s;tinately to oppo&s;e light and truth and reject the offers of the go&s;pel; the more guilty and vile, and the greater criminals are they in God's &s;ight.</Q> Before I proceed, I beg leave to take notice, that Mr. M. when he quotes the&s;e words, having tran&s;cribed the fol|lowing, "While they continue ob&s;tinately to oppo&s;e light and truth, and reject the offers of the go&s;pel," &s;tops here, and adds "<HI>i. e. while they continue unregenerate, as the author explains him&s;elf.</HI>" This he &s;eems to add out of his great tenderne&s;s to the awakened, unregenerate &s;inner, to qualify my words, as if they &s;et the &s;inner in too bad a light, and as if to be barely unregenerate, was a more innocent, harmle&s;s character
<PB N="50" REF="011295_0029_0F869EE0B69A4968">
than the&s;e words repre&s;ented. He puts in this &s;oftening expre&s;&s;ion; as he &s;eems to think it, whenever he has occa&s;ion to quote the words in which I repre&s;ent the &s;tate and exerci&s;es of the unregenerate, even under the highe&s;t awakenings and convictions. A plain evidence this; among an hundred others, that he does not think the awakened, unre|generate &s;inner does ob&s;tinately reject the offers of the go&s;pel. But why then did he not &s;peak this out plainly, and expre&s;sly oppo&s;e me on this foot, which is really the turning point, and the only di&s;pute between us? He might then perhaps have been more con&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf whether he had gained his point, or no.</P>
<P>But let us attend to what he ob&s;erves upon this pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture, to &s;hew that it is not my purpo&s;e. This is in the following words, <Q>Were it never &s;o fully conceded, that tho&s;e that peri&s;h from under the external light of the go&s;pel, do thereby fall under a more aggra|vated condemnation; yet this would be nothing to the author's pur|po&s;e; becau&s;e this may be the ca&s;e with multitudes, that they reject the external light of the evidence of the truth of the go&s;pel with &s;corn and deri&s;ion, without ever being awakened or reformed by it; &s;o the go&s;pel may be a &s;avour of death unto death, unto thou&s;ands that never were one of them a proper &s;ubject of this debate: becau&s;e never awakened to reformation and amendment of life.</Q></P>
<P>This pa&s;&s;age is &s;omewhat dark to me, I own: But if I have under|&s;tood it, the meaning is this, Tho' it is granted that the go&s;pel becomes a &s;avour of death unto them that peri&s;h from under it, yet it does not follow that it is &s;o to them who are awakened and reformed; becau&s;e this may be true of thou&s;ands under the go&s;pel, who do reject it with &s;corn. If any thing is proved by this, I think it is, that the awakened and reformed do not any of them peri&s;h, &s;o the&s;e words have no relation to them; but only to tho&s;e who reject the go&s;pel with &s;corn. They, indeed peri&s;h, and the go&s;pel is a means of aggravating their condem|nation. If any of the awakened and reformed <HI>peri&s;h,</HI> then the go&s;pel is a &s;avour of death unto death unto them; for it is &s;o to <HI>all</HI> that <HI>peri&s;h,</HI> be they awakened and reformed or not.</P>
<P>Indeed I do not wonder if Mr. M. thinks the awakened, humbled, reformed, unregenerate &s;inner, who hone&s;tly attempts to be obedient, and lies at the foot of &s;overeign mercy as his only hope, does never peri&s;h; tho' he allows there are no promi&s;es made to &s;uch.&mdash;Our Sa|viour divides all under the go&s;pel into tho&s;e who do evil and hate the light; and con&s;equently &s;hall fall under an aggravated condemnation: and tho&s;e who love and obey the truth; and &s;o &s;hall be &s;aved. Mr. M. in&s;i&s;ts upon it that his awakened, reformed &s;inner does not belong to the former cla&s;s, as has been ob&s;erved; therefore will not be condemn|ed. What he &s;ays here is of the &s;ame tenor. St. Paul divides all into them that &s;hall peri&s;h, and tho&s;e who &s;hall be &s;aved, and Mr. M. &s;ays tho awakened, reformed &s;inner is not to be ranked among the former, therefore &s;hall be &s;aved.</P>
<P>I SHALL fini&s;h this &s;ection, when I have taken notice of one pa&s;&s;age more under this head. Mr. M. &s;ays,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 17.</NOTE> "Another mi&s;taken way is

which the author argues his point, <HI>as it appears to me,</HI> is determining the degree of man's wickedne&s;s, meerly from the degree of light &s;inned again&s;t, without any regard had to the degree of the &s;trength of his bias to &s;in."</P>
<P>I cannot &s;ay how this happened to <HI>appear</HI> to Mr. M. However, I think it did not "appear to him" from any thing that I have &s;aid. To illu&s;trate this remark, he &s;uppo&s;es two per&s;ons with different degrees of bias to &s;in, under the &s;ame degree of light; and concludes that he, who has the &s;tronge&s;t bias, or inclination to &s;in, is the greate&s;t &s;inner. This is granted: but I have &s;aid nothing that relates to &s;uch a ca&s;e. I am &s;peaking of <HI>the &s;ame</HI> &s;inner, having different degrees of light at diffe|rent times; in which there is no room for the &s;uppo&s;ition of different degrees of bias; unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e that his bias to &s;in increa&s;es, as the light of his con&s;cience does. And this &s;uppo&s;ition is &s;o far from ren|dering my argument inconclu&s;ive, that it greatly &s;trengthens it. And if I any where &s;peak of two &s;inners, repre&s;enting him as the greate&s;t, who has the mo&s;t light, it is &s;uppo&s;ed that their natural powers, ad|vantages, and bias to &s;in, are in all other re&s;pects equal.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. MILLS has mentioned &s;everal things which he intends as ar|guments again&s;t what I have advanced, tho' they are not formal|ly, propo&s;ed as &s;uch; which as they are perhaps as weighty as any he has offered, and will probably have more influence on the minds of many of his readers to prejudice them again&s;t me and the doctrine I have advanced, than all he has &s;aid in his book be&s;ides; it &s;eems ne|ce&s;&s;ary in the fir&s;t place to con&s;ider them.</P>
<P>ONE argument of this kind, which he holds up to view, and harps upon abundantly from the beginning to the end of his piece, is, that the doctrine I advance is NEW. He makes his fir&s;t attack upon me with this weapon. In his fir&s;t &s;entence, after he has in his own words &s;tated the doctrine he means to oppo&s;e, he has the&s;e words.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 5.</NOTE> <Q>I mu&s;t &s;ay the divinity here exhibited, appears to me <HI>&s;trange</HI> and <HI>new;</HI> never before advanced in the chri&s;tian world, by any divine of tolerable &s;en&s;e and reputation, &s;o far as my acquaintance reacheth.</Q> And as he thus begins, he holds up the cry of NEW DIVINITY, to the end of his book.</P>
<P>This has indeed been often objected to doctrines that have been ad|vanced, and many are &s;o weak and fooli&s;h, as to be ready to reject any thing that is propo&s;ed, which is to them &s;trange and new; becau&s;e NEW, <HI>erroneous</HI> and <HI>wrong,</HI> are with them &s;ynonymous words. This was ob|jected again&s;t Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles. This was a grand objection a|gain&s;t
<PB N="52" REF="011295_0030_0F869EE6E21AD5C0">
the reformation from popery. And it is now a &s;ufficient objection again&s;t any doctrine advanced by any divine in the church of Rome, that it is NEW never before advanced, by any of the fathers. And this has always been the cry, whenever there has been any attempt to bring on a reformation in doctrine or manners; "The&s;e are <HI>new things,</HI> therefore wrong and not to be received." Mr. M. him&s;elf has not forgot, I conclude, that he has been often in a way of reproach, called a NEW <HI>light.</HI> And as he has had &s;o much to teach him what influence this now has with too many, and mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that it is quite &s;uffici|ent to &s;et them again&s;t a man and his doctrine, to tell them he has publi&s;hed &s;trange and new divinity: his making u&s;e of it as he has done, is not only very weak, but is quite unju&s;tifiable and wrong. For this is in a high degree impo&s;ing on &s;uch, and confirming them in a preju|dice, which every public teacher ought to guard again&s;t, and endeavour to eradicate to the utmo&s;t of his power; as it can never do any real good, and has proved infinitely mi&s;chievous in ten thou&s;and in&s;tances; and will always be improved again&s;t the di&s;covery of new truth, and the increa&s;e of light and knowledge in the church of Chri&s;t, which is &s;o much predicted in &s;cripture, and is &s;o greatly to be de&s;ired. And Mr. M. is yet more inexcu&s;able and culpable, if he has rai&s;ed and kept up this cry of NEW DIVINITY, with a <HI>de&s;ign</HI> to avail him&s;elf of this too common prejudice among mankind, the more effectually to run down and rai&s;e the popular cry again&s;t the man and the doctrine which he had undertaken to oppo&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. M perhaps thinks he has given &s;ufficient caution on this head, in that when he &s;peaks of my doctrine as "quite new" he adds, <Q>And therefore requires the <HI>greater caution,</HI> not to admit of other than clear and demon&s;trative &s;cripture evidence and proof for the confirmation of it.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 7, 8.</NOTE></Q> But what he has a&s;&s;erted <HI>here</HI> is directly contrary to truth and all rea&s;on. We ought always to exerci&s;e &s;o much caution as never to admit any doctrine as true, without good evidence: and all doctrines propo&s;ed to us as true, whether old or new, are to be carefully exami|ned and tried in the light of &s;cripture, and not to be received unle&s;s we judge them &s;upported by that unerring rule: and in this enquiry and examination, their being <HI>old</HI> or <HI>new,</HI> ought not to come into con&s;i|deration, &s;o as to have the lea&s;t weight with us, on one &s;ide or the other. It is no argument at all that a doctrine is true, becau&s;e it has been long received as &s;uch, nor is it the lea&s;t evidence that a doctrine is not agree|able to &s;cripture, that it is "quite new, and never before advanced." And therefore both <HI>old</HI> and <HI>new</HI> are to be examined with <HI>equal</HI> caution, and the latter to be as readily admitted as the former, if it be equally agreeable to &s;cripture. And if any one u&s;es <HI>greater caution</HI> in examin|ing and admitting one or the other, either becau&s;e it is <HI>new,</HI> or be|cau&s;e it is <HI>old,</HI> he &s;o far is governed by un&s;ea&s;onable prejudice. The word NEW ought not to be mentioned in &s;uch an enquiry. Therefore Mr. M. cannot be ju&s;tified in any thing he has &s;aid on this head; but is, an&s;werable for all the prejudice he has by this means excited in the minds of any again&s;t the author and doctrine he oppo&s;es, and for all the odium this outcry has rai&s;ed.</P>

"Many &s;hall run to and fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and knowledge &s;hall be increa&s;ed." "Every &s;cribe which is in&s;tructed into the kingdom of heaven, is like a man that is an hou&s;holder, which bringeth forth out of his trea&s;ure things <HI>new</HI> and old." And &s;hall any one of the&s;e profe&s;&s;ed <HI>&s;cribes,</HI> rai&s;e a cry again&s;t another merely becau&s;e he brings forth <HI>new divinity!</HI></P>
<P>But this charge and out-cry will appear wor&s;e, and more injurious &s;till, if the fact is not true, and the doctrine I have advanced is indeed not <HI>new divinity,</HI> but has been often taught, tho' not ju&s;t in my words, or in &s;o expre&s;s and particular a manner as I have done, by many <HI>old</HI> and noted divines. They have all a&s;&s;erted it in effect, who have taught that the &s;um of all &s;in lies in the exerci&s;es of the heart, and that unbe|lief, or rejection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t is beyond compari&s;on the greate&s;t &s;in that men can be guilty of; and that the awakened convinced &s;inner does reject Chri&s;t with as great &s;trength and ob&s;tinacy of heart, as ever, under all his light and conviction, which does amazingly aggravate his &s;in. Was it a matter of importance enough to call for it, a volume of collections to this purpo&s;e from many eminent divines, that have been long dead, might be publi&s;hed. But this would be labor in vain, as it would not be the lea&s;t evidence that the doctrine I have publi&s;hed is true, or afford the lea&s;t degree of rea&s;on why it &s;hould be received with le&s;s caution, than if it was in direct oppo&s;ition to all the divines that ever lived. However, for Mr. M's &s;atisfaction, and to calm his mind which has been &s;o greatly agitated and troubled about this "&s;trange, new divinity," which appeared to him "too &s;trange to be true," I will make a quotation or two from one who, I tru&s;t he will own was a "divine of tolerable &s;en&s;e and reputation. It is no le&s;s or <HI>later</HI> a divine than Doct. Owen.</P>

<P>Here are not only two of the mo&s;t noted divines in New-England, not again&s;t me, but expre&s;sly on my &s;ide of the que&s;tion; but calvini&s;|tic divines in general, &s;o far as Pre&s;ident Edwards's judgment is to be relied upon with re&s;pect to this fact. I have tran&s;cribed this partly to enlarge Mr. M's acquaintance, that he may no longer be able to &s;ay, the divinity I have exhibited was <Q>never before advanced in the chri&s;|tian world by any divine of tolerable &s;en&s;e and reputation, <HI>&s;o far as my acquaintance reacheth</HI></Q></P>
<P>After what I have &s;aid above, it will perhaps be needle&s;s to ob&s;erve, that I do not make the&s;e quotations becau&s;e I would not be thought to have publi&s;hed any thing NEW. I now declare I had much rather pub|li&s;h NEW DIVINITY than any other. And the more of this, the better, if it be but true. Nor do I think any doctrine can be "too &s;trange to be true." I &s;hould think it hardly worth while to write, if I had no thing <HI>new</HI> to &s;ay. And if I am &s;o unhappy as to live in an age in which I mu&s;t be condemned merely becau&s;e I bring certain <HI>&s;trange</HI> things to their ears, I will appeal from them, and from Mr. M. in particular, to the happy people who &s;hall live in the la&s;t days, who will be thank|ful to everyone who has ca&s;t in his mite towards the overthrow of er|ror, however long e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the di&s;covery of truth, however <HI>new</HI> and overlooked by all generations before: And will look on him as an enemy to the church &amp; to mankind, who has u&s;ed his influence to &s;tifle and &s;uppre&s;s every or any <HI>new</HI> truth, becau&s;e he had never heard or thought of it before.</P>
<P>ANOTHER argument again&s;t me is, that the doctrine I have advanced is not only <HI>new,</HI> but directly contrary to the opinion of many eminent fathers and divines; and among the re&s;t, "the late pre&s;ident
<PB N="55" REF="011295_0031_0F869EE812436E28">
Edwards, who will," (&s;ays Mr. M.) "&s;erve, I &s;uppo&s;e, in&s;tead of many with our author."</P>
<P>ANSWER. This argument appears to me of no more weight than former. The opinion of no man or body of men, however great and renouned in their day, ought to have the lea&s;t weight with us in our inqui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ies after the truths of the go&s;pel. He who pays the lea&s;t regard to this, or is in any degree influenced by it, gives him&s;elf up to a very uncertain, fallible guide. And if he is not lead wrong, but believes what is real truth, meerly upon the credit and te&s;timony of others, it will be of no more &s;aving advantage to him, than if it was not true: for &s;uch implicit faith is no better than no faith at all. Be&s;ides, it is a great abu&s;e of any divine who is dead, to rely upon him, or quote him as an authority, who knew him&s;elf to be fallible, and would be very &s;orry to have his mi&s;takes received as truth, meerly becau&s;e he was &s;o unhappy as to publi&s;h them.</P>
<P>He therefore may be ju&s;tly cen&s;ured who quotes any father, or num|ber of fathers, as an authority, or of the lea&s;t weight to &s;upport what he holds, or run down what he oppo&s;es. It is much wor&s;e than child|i&s;h trifling; it is an abu&s;e of the public, and tends to uphold people in that which they are very prone to, and has proved pernicious to thou|&s;ands, viz. Relying on the opinion of others, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who have had the character of &s;ound and great divines, without examining for them&s;elves. But,</P>
<P N="2">2. It does not appear evident to me that the divines Mr. M. has quoted again&s;t me, do &s;ay any thing really contrary to what I have ad|vanced. If it is an abu&s;e to quote an author, as an authority to &s;up|port or oppo&s;e <HI>any</HI> doctrine; it is yet much more injurious to mi&s;un|der&s;tand them, and produce them to oppo&s;e a doctrine which they ne|ver meant to oppo&s;e. Therefore, tho' the matter in di&s;pute between Mr. M. and me is not in the lea&s;t degree to be determined by them, and it is really no matter, in this view, on which &s;ide of the que&s;tion they are; yet it is but a piece of ju&s;tice to them, to remove the mi&s;re|pre&s;entation, when their words are quoted in a &s;en&s;e which they never meant.</P>
<P>Mr. M's quotation from the We&s;tmin&s;ter and Savoy confe&s;&s;ions, is in the following words, <Q>Works done by unregenerate men, although, for the matter of them, they may be things which GOD commands, and of good u&s;e both to them&s;elves and others; yet, becau&s;e they proceed not from an heart purified by faith, nor are done in a right manner, according to the word, nor to a right end, the glory of GOD; they are therefore &s;inful, and cannot plea&s;e GOD, or make man meet to receive grace from God. And yet their neglect of them is more &s;inful and di&s;plea&s;ing to GOD.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. M. &s;ays, "This la&s;t clau&s;e, taken in <HI>a compound &s;en&s;e</HI> is denied by Mr. Hopkins." I confe&s;s I know not what &s;en&s;e that is which he here calls <HI>a compound &s;en&s;e,</HI> unle&s;s it be a &s;en&s;e compounded of the author's &s;en&s;e and Mr. M's. It does not appear, I think, that this clau&s;e, taken according to <HI>common &s;en&s;e,</HI> has ever been denied by me.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="011295_0032_0F869EE8D2233FE0">
All they &s;ay is, that the practice of the&s;e things which are externally right, is le&s;s &s;inful than the neglect of them would be, other things being equal. And I &s;ay nothing contrary to this. They do not &s;ay that he is the lea&s;t &s;inner, le&s;s guilty and vile in all ca&s;es, and in every in&s;tance, who attends on tho&s;e external things, than he might be, in the neglect of them. Nor is this true. A per&s;on may put on all external &s;obriety and religion, out of enmity to chri&s;tianity, and with a de&s;ign to put him&s;elf under advantage thereby to overthrow it more effectually. In this ca&s;e I &s;uppo&s;e all will grant, he is as &s;inful and vile as if he had lived in the neglect of the&s;e things. If a per&s;on believes in his con&s;ci|ence it is wrong and very &s;inful for him to attend the externals of re|ligion, and that GOD forbids him to do it, his doing the&s;e things in this ca&s;e, would be more &s;inful in him, than the neglect of them. The pa&s;&s;age under con&s;ideration (Mr. M. will grant) has no re&s;pect to &s;uch in&s;tances as the&s;e; &s;o affirms nothing about them. But it has as much re&s;pect to the&s;e, as to the ca&s;e I have &s;tated in my &s;ection on means. I &s;tate a particular ca&s;e, in which I &s;ay the unregenerate &s;inner is more guilty and vile, even tho' he reforms all external ways of &s;in, and per|forms all external duty, than he was when he did not &s;o; at the &s;ame time I expre&s;sly a&s;&s;ert that his greater &s;infulne&s;s does not con&s;i&s;t in his reformation of external &s;ins, &amp;c. but in &s;omething el&s;e, quite in|dependent of this. Is this to a&s;&s;ert attendance on the&s;e externals is not in it&s;elf con&s;idered, other things being equal, le&s;s &s;inful? &s;urely no: nor any thing like it. Therefore I do not contradict what the a&s;&s;em|bly of divines here a&s;&s;ert. I do not &s;ay that the awakened, convinced &s;inner, would not be more guilty in continuing in external wickedne&s;s, and the neglect of external religion than he is in his external refor|mations, &amp;c. but that he is now more guilty and vile, all things con|&s;idered, than he was in a &s;tate of ignorance and &s;ecurity, whatever alte|ration there is in his external conduct. How Mr. M. came to think I had denied what is a&s;&s;erted in the pa&s;&s;age quoted, I cannot tell. Per|haps he will unfold the matter, when he comes to explain his <HI>compound &s;en&s;e,</HI> until this &s;hall be done, I mu&s;t &s;ay, "no con&s;equence, and wait for light."</P>
<P>Before I leave this pa&s;&s;age, I would ju&s;t ob&s;erve, that tho' it contains nothing in oppo&s;ition to what I have a&s;&s;erted, Mr. M. has advanced things in his book, which I think, are directly contrary to it. Here it is &s;aid, "They," (i. e. works done by unregenerate men) are &s;inful, <HI>and cannot plea&s;e GOD.</HI> But Mr. M. &s;peaking of Ahab, &s;ays the Lord took a <HI>favourable notice</HI> of his doings.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P. 31.</NOTE> And he &s;peaks of GOD'S <HI>expre&s;s approbation</HI> of Jehu, and the congregation of I&s;rael in the wilderne&s;s, for what they did, while unregenerate.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 32.</NOTE> Surely to &s;ay that the doings and works of the unregenerate <HI>cannot plea&s;e GOD,</HI> and to &s;ay that GOD <HI>takes a favourable notice of them,</HI> and <HI>approves</HI> of them, are as contrary and oppo&s;ite propo&s;itions as any can be. To &s;ay that God approves of that, with which he is not, and cannot be plea&s;ed, is a flat contradiction; and is ju&s;t the &s;ame as to &s;ay God cannot be plea&s;ed with that, with which he actually is plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>In this pa&s;&s;age it is al&s;o &s;aid, that the works and attainments of the
<PB N="57" REF="011295_0032_0F869EE8D2233FE0">
unregenerate, do not <HI>make a man meet to receive grace from GOD.</HI> Mr. M. in direct oppo&s;ition to this, has laboured thro' &s;everal pages to prove that the unregenerate do by their exerci&s;es and works get nearer to true grace or holine&s;s; or in the &s;tate of their mind nearer to that of good men.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See P. 24&mdash;28.</NOTE></P>
<P>I do not mention Mr. M's oppo&s;ition to "the te&s;timony of &s;o many calvini&s;tic divines," as any evidence that he is not right. That he has herein gro&s;sly erred from the truth, I tru&s;t will appear evident enough before I have done; tho' his contradicting the&s;e divines is no evidence again&s;t him at all. I ob&s;erve this only to &s;hew his &s;elf-contradiction, in that he with high approbation quotes a pa&s;&s;age, as being directly a|gain&s;t me, and then repeatedly contradicts it him&s;elf; &s;o that when the matter comes to be examined, it &s;tands not at all again&s;t me; but di|rectly again&s;t him&s;elf.</P>
<P>WE will now attend to what he has quoted from Pre&s;ident <HI>Edwards.</HI> He &s;ays, "He is &s;o expre&s;s to the point as if he had wrote on purpo&s;e to confute the doctrine I am oppo&s;ing." His words are, <Q>The exerci&s;e of natural con&s;cience is &s;uch and &s;uch degrees, wherein appears &s;uch a mea&s;ure of awakening or &s;en&s;ibility of con&s;cience, tho' it be not of the nature of real po&s;itive virtue, or true moral goodne&s;s, yet has a negative moral goodne&s;s; becau&s;e in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, it is an evidence of the ab&s;ence of that higher degree of wickedne&s;s, which cau&s;es great in&s;en&s;ibility, or &s;tupidity of con&s;cience.</Q></P>
<P>That the author in the&s;e words has no re&s;pect to the doctrine Mr. M. is oppo&s;ing; and much le&s;s &s;ays any thing on purpo&s;e to confute it, will be evident, if the following things are well con&s;idered.</P>
<P N="1">1. He is not here &s;peaking of that light and conviction of con&s;cience, which the unregenerate &s;inner has in a work preparatory to regenerati|on and conver&s;ion; but of that &s;en&s;ibility, and tho&s;e dictates of con|&s;cience which mo&s;t men have in a greater or le&s;s degree, even heathen, as well as tho&s;e that are under the light of the go&s;pel, which &s;ugge&s;t to them in general what they owe to GOD, and to their neighbours, and the rea&s;onablene&s;s of GOD'S law, which may be called the law of na|ture. He is here dealing with tho&s;e men who in&s;i&s;t upon it that the&s;e dictates of natural con&s;cience are true virtue, and hence infer that all men are naturally virtuous in &s;ome degree. He is here giving the rea&s;on why the&s;e dictates of con&s;cience have been mi&s;taken for true virtue. They with whom he is concerned here, never &s;peak of that peculiar kind and degree of awakening &amp; conviction of con&s;cience which &s;inners under <HI>genuine conviction</HI> have. They are &s;o far from mi&s;taking &s;uch conviction for true virtue, that they rather look upon it to be gro&s;s delu&s;ion, grounded on quite wrong and fal&s;e notions of things. Pre&s;ident <HI>Edwards</HI> therefore has not this awakening and conviction in view, nor has any re&s;pect to it in the&s;e words. Therefore his words do not confute any thing which I have &s;aid concerning that, to which they have no reference.</P>
<P N="2">2. Pre&s;ident <HI>Edwards</HI> is here &s;peaking of tho&s;e dictates of con&s;cience which are regarded and obeyed, in a great mea&s;ure at lea&s;t, in the view and apprehen&s;ion of him who is the &s;ubject of them. Surely he does
<PB N="58" REF="011295_0033_0F869EE901119710">
not mean to a&s;&s;ert that however the dictates of con&s;cience, are di&s;re|garded, oppo&s;ed and &s;inned again&s;t; yet this conviction is an evidence that he who has them is not &s;o great a &s;inner, as he who commits the &s;ame &s;ins in ignorance, and not again&s;t his con&s;cience. If he does, the&s;e words are as much again&s;t Mr. M. and almo&s;t every body el&s;e, as they are again&s;t me. But I am &s;peaking of an awakening and &s;en&s;ibili|ty of con&s;cience, which is perfectly oppo&s;ed and &s;inned again&s;t. It is therefore certain, that he has no reference to the convinced &s;inner of whom I &s;peak. And what makes this more certain, if po&s;&s;ible, is, that when he is expre&s;sly &s;peaking of &s;uch an awakened, convinced &s;inner, he repre&s;ents him as guilty of the <HI>mo&s;t heinous kinds of wickedne&s;s,</HI> and ESPECIALLY <HI>provoking to God,</HI> as has been &s;hewn.</P>
<P>In one word, he here &s;peaks of different per&s;ons, under the &s;ame de|gree of light and advantages every way. This light makes impre&s;&s;ions on one, and not on the other. In this ca&s;e it is an evidence that the for|mer is not &s;o much blinded and hardened by &s;in as the latter: &s;o is an evidence of an higher degree of &s;in in the latter than in the former. But what is this to the awakening and convictions of con&s;cience which are brought on not by the meer force of external means; but by ex|traordinary influences on the mind, counteracting &amp; repelling the influ|ence of that wickedne&s;s of heart which had before held the mind in blindne&s;s and &s;ecurity? Not a word is &s;aid about &s;uch a ca&s;e as this, therefore nothing to the purpo&s;e for which Mr. M. has made the quotation.</P>
<P N="3">3. Let it be ob&s;erved that the words here quoted, taken in the &s;en&s;e in which Mr. M. under&s;tands them, are directly again&s;t him&s;elf. He &s;peaks of this awakening and &s;en&s;ibility of con&s;cience as taking place in an ordinary and common way, and as common to all in whom it is not weakened and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, by a cour&s;e of oppo&s;ition to it. There|fore it is not brought on the mind, and wrought in it, by any influ|ences of the &s;pirit of GOD. If therefore he is here &s;peaking of that a|wakening and conviction which is preparatory to conver&s;ion, he &s;up|po&s;es no &s;pecial agency of the &s;pirit of God in this, and implicitly de|nies it; which Mr. M. repeatedly &s;peaks of as a dangerous error. Mr. M. therefore by quoting the&s;e words, in the &s;en&s;e he puts upon them, and with approbation, is guilty of &s;elf-contradiction, as he was in the former in&s;tance.</P>
<P>I COME now to the la&s;t argument of this kind, which Mr. M. maker u&s;e of again&s;t me It is in one word this, That I have joined with SANDEMAN: &s;o far at lea&s;t, as to be on his &s;ide of the que&s;tion, and favour what he has advanced, in what Mr. M. undertakes to oppo&s;e. Of this he takes care to remind the reader in the fir&s;t &s;entence, after he has &s;tated what he &s;ays I have a&s;&s;erted. <Q>I mu&s;t &s;ay the divinity here exhibited appears to me &s;trange and new, never before advanced in the chri&s;tian world by any divine of tolerable &s;en&s;e and reputation, &s;o far as my acquaintance reacheth; unle&s;s &s;omething of a like complexion is to be &s;ound in the letters on Theron and A&s;pa&s;io, a&s;|cribed to <HI>Sandeman,</HI> who has well nigh condemned all other divines;
<PB N="59" REF="011295_0033_0F869EE901119710">
to e&s;tabli&s;h him&s;elf and his party as the only true church of Chri&s;t upon earth, which, it is &s;aid, hath for many ages been concealed in the wilderne&s;s, but now lately hath appeared in them, agreeable to other enthu&s;ia&s;tic vi&s;ionaries.</Q></P>
<P>Sad indeed, to be guilty of &s;aying that which looks like <HI>any thing</HI> "which has been publi&s;hed by &s;uch a man! He has endeavored to keep this in view to the end of his book; and in his concluding pa|ragraph &s;ays, <Q>I have not been able to per&s;uade my&s;elf, but that &s;ome things have by him (the author he is oppo&s;ing) been carried too far in favor of what is commonly called the <HI>Sandemanean</HI> error.</Q> Thus I am ranked with Sandeman in front and rear. I cannot per&s;uade my|&s;elf that Mr. M. thought this ought to have the weight of a feather in determining, whether what I have a&s;&s;erted is right or wrong. This argument, however will have more influence on the minds of many of his readers than all that he has &s;aid be&s;ides. Mr. M. could not be in|&s;en&s;ible of this; and if he has taken this method, and &s;aid the&s;e things with this view, and on purpo&s;e to rai&s;e an <HI>odium,</HI> and gain any advan|tage to his cau&s;e by this means, he cannot be excu&s;ed. But of this the reader will judge.</P>
<P>I know not what foundation or good rea&s;on Mr. M. had to mention Sandeman's name in this controver&s;y. Mr. S. &s;ays not one word, that I have ob&s;erved, relating to this point, in any of his writings: Nor is there any rea&s;on to conclude that what I have a&s;&s;erted is more agree|able to him, than to Mr. M. I claim no alliance to him, nor he to me, that I know of. I have thought, and &s;till think, that the faith and holine&s;s which he teaches are not the faith and holine&s;s which are in|culcated in the new te&s;tament; but e&s;&s;entially defective, and even op|po&s;ite to the whole of divine revelation: &s;o quite &s;ubver&s;ive of true chri&s;tianity. He has however, &s;aid many things very well, and &s;ome by which many public teachers &s;tand ju&s;tly corrected. And if he mu&s;t be branded with holding the Sandemanean error, who agrees with San|deman in any point, or &s;ays any thing "of a like complexion" with &s;omething which he has wrote, who then &s;hall e&s;cape?</P>
<P>By all I can learn, my &s;ection on means is no more agreeable to San|deman and his followers, than to Mr. M. Mr. M. approves of the nine fir&s;t &s;ections; but finds great fault with the tenth; and &s;o does Mr. Sandeman. Herein they agree. And it would not be a difficult ta&s;k to &s;hew that Mr. M. agrees with him in many more points than I do; and there is evidence enough that he has a much better opinion of the man and the religion he teaches than I have: and that Mr. S. is much more friendly to him, than to me, and rather takes his &s;ide in the con|trover&s;y between us. What rea&s;on then had Mr. M. to rai&s;e &s;uch an out-cry through all the country, and in&s;inuate to the world that I held <HI>the Sandemanean error?</HI> Was it becau&s;e he knew that this would make many &s;tare at me, as &s;ome dreadful mon&s;ter?</P>
<P>When I have attended to this method Mr. M. has taken in his di&s;|pute with me, and the way in which he has managed it, which &s;eems almo&s;t peculiar to him&s;elf; and how he has not only tacked Sandeman

<HEAD>SECT. VI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>IN which Mr. Mills's four arguments to prove the nega|tive, are con&s;idered and refuted.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. MILLS has reduced his arguments again&s;t what I have advanc|ed to four general heads; which I &s;hall con&s;ider in the order in which he has placed them.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t argument is founded on the <HI>ab&s;urdities</HI> which he &s;ays will fol|low from what I have a&s;&s;erted; three of which he particularly mentions.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t he &s;tates in the following words, <Q>If the principle advanc|ed be true, there is no po&s;&s;ibility of the profligate &s;inner's becoming le&s;s vicious in the &s;tate of his mind, whatever be the wickedne&s;s he lives in the practice of, by any reformation of life while unrege|nerate; becau&s;e reforming in any in&s;tance &s;uppo&s;es the increa&s;e of internal light and &s;en&s;ibility of con&s;cience; and then, according to this <HI>new</HI> principle, he is undoubtedly, on the whole, more vile, odi|ous and abominable in God's &s;ight, than he would have been, had he continued &s;ecure and at ea&s;e, going on in his &s;ins.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P. 18.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>It appears from what I have &s;aid already that this is not a ju&s;t con&s;e|quence from that which I have a&s;&s;erted. For, every in&s;tance of refor|mation of life, does not &s;uppo&s;e an increa&s;e of internal light. The profligate may reform his life from worldly motives, or by the removal of the temptation and opportunity, &amp;c. without having any more light and conviction of con&s;cience than he had before. Or he may have light and conviction of con&s;cience enough to lead him to reform his life; and yet not be the convinced &s;inner of whom I &s;peak, as has been ob&s;erved before. This therefore is not an ab&s;urdity (if it is one) that is con|tained in the doctrine I have advanced but is wholly grounded in the mi&s;repre&s;entation he has made of it.</P>
<P>I have indeed a&s;&s;erted that the awakened, convinced &s;inner which I de&s;cribe is more guilty and vile in the exerci&s;es of his mind, than he
<PB N="61" REF="011295_0034_0F869EE9C53A0728">
was in a &s;tate of ignorance and &s;ecurity, whatever is his external refor|mation. This is the principle it&s;elf which I hold. And what Mr. M. mentions as an ab&s;urdity no more follows from this propo&s;ition, than it does from any other that ever was thought of. If there is any ab|&s;urdity in the ca&s;e, it lies in the propo&s;ition it&s;elf: If there is no ab|&s;urdity in this, no ab&s;urd con&s;equence can be drawn from it; unle&s;s the ab&s;urdity con&s;i&s;ts in it's being a forced and unju&s;t con&s;equence. In this &s;en&s;e, I acknowledge, Mr. M. has made out a very &s;trange and mon&s;trous ab&s;urdity indeed. But as it is one entirely of his own make, I choo&s;e he &s;hould have all the credit of it.</P>
<P>Is there any ab&s;urdity in &s;aying, that a profligate may reform his external conduct in &s;uch circum&s;tances and with &s;uch views and exer|ci&s;es of heart, as on the whole to be more guilty and vile, than he was before? If not, then there is no ab&s;urdity in what I have advanced on this head. I a&s;&s;ert that it is impo&s;&s;ible for a &s;inner not to grow more guilty and vile than he was before, whatever alteration takes place in his external conduct, if he goes into a cour&s;e of &s;tronger and more direct acts of oppo&s;ition to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, contrary to much higher degrees of light and conviction of con&s;cience, than before. This, I think, has been fully proved: And am &s;ure it leads to no ab&s;urdity what&s;oever. If it is impo&s;&s;ible that a profligate &s;hould reform in any in&s;tance, with|out bringing him&s;elf into the&s;e circum&s;tances; then all per&s;ons unre|generate do become more guilty and vile in every in&s;tance of reformati|on. But where is the ab&s;urdity of this? Is there any ab&s;urdity in &s;uppo&s;ing that the abu&s;e of light and &s;inning again&s;t it, is in all ca&s;es criminal in proportion to the degree of that light; and that the unre|generate do always abu&s;e all the light they have; and that the awa|kened, convinced &s;inner is guilty of a much higher abu&s;e of light than any other per&s;on can be?</P>
<P>But before I leave the pa&s;&s;age now quoted I would particularly re|mark upon two expre&s;&s;ions in it. He &s;ays, "there is no po&s;&s;ibility of the profligate &s;inner's becoming le&s;s vicious <HI>in the &s;tate of his mind,&mdash;by</HI> any reformation of life." This &s;uppo&s;es that reformation of life has &s;ome influence on the &s;tate of the mind to render the latter le&s;s vicious: the former preceeding as the cau&s;e, and the latter following as the effect. This is certainly an ab&s;urdity. All vice lies in the &s;tate or exerci&s;es of the mind; and no external conduct is virtuous or vicious, le&s;s or more, nor has any relation to the &s;tate of the mind, any further than it is the fruit and effect of that. But, pa&s;&s;ing this ab&s;urdity, what he a&s;&s;erts here is only this: The profligate is nor le&s;s vicious in the &s;tate of his mind by any reformations of life, &s;o long as the &s;tate of his mind is not le&s;s vicious. "Strange ab&s;urdity this, indeed!</P>
<P>The other expre&s;&s;ion I would take notice of, is this, "&s;en&s;ibility of con&s;cience." This is a very ambiguous expre&s;&s;ion. By it &s;ometimes is meant <HI>tenderne&s;s of con&s;cience,</HI> and &s;o denotes &s;omething good and right in the heart. It &s;ometimes means only <HI>conviction of con&s;cience.</HI> This is con&s;i&s;tent with the mo&s;t perfect and highe&s;t degrees of wicked|ne&s;s of heart. It is never true of the unregenerate that they have any
<PB N="62" REF="011295_0035_0F869EEAF1846828">
&s;en&s;ibility of con&s;cience in the former &s;en&s;e; in which &s;en&s;e Mr. M. &s;eems to u&s;e it; and the reader who is not well on his guard will take it in this &s;en&s;e, and &s;o be in&s;en&s;ibly led a&s;ide by it. This expre&s;&s;ion he often u&s;es, and always &s;o as tends to blind and mi&s;lead. Not with &s;uch a de&s;ign I believe; for I conclude he fir&s;t impo&s;ed on him&s;elf, by putting a &s;en&s;e on the&s;e words which is not compatible with the unre|generate, and then impo&s;ed on his reader.</P>
<P>I am inclined here to tran&s;cribe the following words, in which Mr. M. endeavours to repre&s;ent the ab&s;urdity he fathers on me in a very &s;triking light, e&s;pecially as they are a &s;pecimen of much of the &s;ame kind &s;cattered thro' his book.&mdash; "I appeal to the common &s;en&s;e of man|kind, Is not this &s;trange divinity? What! is there no po&s;&s;ibility <Q>that the drunkard, the thief, the liar, the profane &s;wearer, the adul|terer, the murderer and bla&s;phemer &s;hould become, on the whole, le&s;s vicious in GOD'S &s;ight while unregenerate, by reforming all this atrocious wickedne&s;s, tho' on no higher principle than that of na|tural con&s;cience, awakened by the common influences of the &s;pirit, than he would be, continuing in the practice of all this wickedne&s;s? Strange ab&s;urdity this!</Q></P>
<P>Here is a loud out-cry indeed! But is there any <HI>rea&s;on</HI> in it? Is it not rather only an application to the imagination, prejudices and pa&s;|&s;ions of the ignorant and unguarded; and the whole of it a gro&s;s mi&s;|repre&s;entation? It is an ea&s;y matter thus to harangue, and cry out, O &s;trange! Strange ab&s;urdity this! He has pronounced this an ab&s;ur|dity repeatedly in very &s;trong terms: But if it really is one, he has not offered the lea&s;t rea&s;on to prove it to be &s;o, nor &s;o much as attempted it. Mr. M. profe&s;&s;es to remove as far as po&s;&s;ible from all <HI>ab&s;tru&s;e, metaphy&s;ical rea&s;oning.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 30.</NOTE> By this means, or &s;ome other, he &s;eems to be got far enough from <HI>rea&s;oning</HI> of every kind. I &s;uppo&s;e I have &s;aid enough in the foregoing &s;ections to &s;hew that this is &s;o far from being an ab&s;urdity with re&s;pect to the <HI>convinced,</HI> unregenerate &s;inner, that it is a mo&s;t evident and important truth. Let the calm, thoughtful reader &s;top and judge.</P>
<P>THE next ab&s;urdity is expre&s;&s;ed in the following words, <Q>Another ab&s;urdity ari&s;ing from this <HI>new principle</HI> is, that the more &s;tupid, care|le&s;s and unconcerned men are, under the go&s;pel, about what &s;ins they commit, and what duties they neglect, the le&s;s vile, odious and abo|minable they are on the whole in GOD'S &s;ight.</Q></P>
<P>If Mr. M. had &s;aid, that the more blind and ignorant men are under the go&s;pel, about &s;in, and duty, the le&s;s vile they are in committing tho&s;e &s;ins, and omiting the duties; this would indeed not have been a con&s;equence from what he is arguing again&s;t; but really the very principle it&s;elf. And this &s;urely is &s;o far from being an ab&s;urdity, that it is a &s;elf-evident propo&s;ition. What&s;oever is contained in the words now quoted more than this, is a mi&s;repre&s;entation. In the&s;e words, and what follows for the illu&s;tration of them, it is repre&s;ented as if it followed from what I have advanced that <HI>the more con&s;cientious</HI> men are, or the more inclined and di&s;po&s;ed they are to act agreable to their con|&s;ciences,
<PB N="63" REF="011295_0035_0F869EEAF1846828">
and come up to them, the more vile and odious they are. But I have been &s;o far from a&s;&s;erting this, or any thing from whence it will follow; that I place the greater guilt and vilene&s;s of the convinc|ed &s;inner in his oppo&s;ing and acting again&s;t the clear light and dictates of his own con&s;cience, however &s;en&s;ible he is of the dreadful con&s;e|quence of this to him. The reader needs only to keep this in view to &s;ee how groundle&s;s all that Mr. M. &s;ays on this head, is, and that the whole is only a gro&s;s mi&s;repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>But what if &s;inners are in &s;uch a &s;ituation, that &s;o long as they conti|nue perfect enemies to GOD, and the Saviour, and are di&s;po&s;ed to abu&s;e all light and advantages, and all means u&s;ed with them to bring them to repentance, all means u&s;ed with them, and all light and conviction of con&s;cience, render their ob&s;tinacy and impenitence more vile and odious? What ab&s;urdity is there in this? Mr. M. has not attempted to &s;hew where the ab&s;urdity lies. He has only dre&s;&s;ed the matter up in &s;uch words and phra&s;es as to keep the truth of the ca&s;e out of view, and mi&s;lead the inattentive reader, and then cries out, "&s;trange ab&s;ur|dity this!"</P>
<P>I COME now to the la&s;t ab&s;urdity which Mr. M. mentions. <Q>Ano|ther ab&s;urdity that ari&s;es from this principle is, that in an exact pro|portion as any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> under the go&s;pel is, in the language of the author, more likely to be &s;aved, and in the phra&s;e of our Saviour, 'near|er the kingdom of God,' he is on the whole more vile and odious in God's &s;ight.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 21, 22.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>But where is the ab&s;urdity of this? Mr. M. does not attempt to &s;hew wherein the ab&s;urdity lies. It &s;eems he thought his calling it an ab&s;ur|dity was &s;ufficient to make it pa&s;s for one. It may perhaps with the <HI>unthink&icirc;ng</HI> reader who takes Mr. M's advice, and follows his example, in "removing as far as po&s;&s;ible from all ab&s;tru&s;e, metaphy&s;ical rea&s;on|ing," that is, as I take it, from all that clo&s;e, &s;ound rea&s;oning, which requires exactne&s;s of thought, and fixed attention of mind. It will al&s;o pa&s;s for the greate&s;t ab&s;urdity with all tho&s;e who think that GOD is more inclined to &s;hew mercy to a le&s;s &s;inner than to a greater; and that the lea&s;t guilty and vile are more likely to be &s;aved than others; and are founding their hopes of their own &s;alvation very much in this, that they are "not as other men," not &s;o great &s;inners, &s;o guilty and vile in God's &s;ight as the ignorant, &s;ecure profligate. M. M's whole book is &s;uited to plea&s;e per&s;ons of this &s;tamp as he not only goes on this &s;uppo&s;ition here, but every where el&s;e.</P>
<P>I particularly ob&s;erved in my &s;ection on means,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 143, 144.</NOTE> that there is no foundation for &s;uch a notion in &s;cripture; to which Mr. M. has not &s;aid a word. He ought to have &s;hewed that what I had a&s;&s;erted there was groundle&s;s and contrary to &s;cripture, and not to have taken for granted, what I thought I had proved from &s;cripture not to be true, and then to build &s;o much upon it. Indeed it is a notion &s;o &s;hockingly di&s;honorable to the &s;overeign grace of God, and contrary to the whole go&s;pel, and has &s;uch a direct tendency to exclude every one from all hope, and throw him into ab&s;olute di&s;pair, who does not with the
<PB N="64" REF="011295_0036_0F869EEB471D7110">
proud phari&s;ee, think him&s;elf a le&s;s &s;inner than others in general area that I wonder not at all that Mr. M. cho&s;e rather to keep it, as it were, behind the curtain, than to bring it out to open view, and avow it expre&s;sly.</P>
<P>But to attend more particularly to this ab&s;urdity. If there is any in the ca&s;e, it lies in this propo&s;ition, viz. That a greater &s;inner, one who is on the whole more vile and odious in God's &s;ight than another, may be more likely to be &s;aved, than that other, and then he him&s;elf was, when he was not &s;o guilty and vile, as he now is: But this is &s;o far from containing any ab&s;urdity in it, that all, and even Mr. M. him&s;elf, will grant it to be true beyond all di&s;pute. For in&s;tance, tho&s;e who live under the go&s;pel are more likely to be &s;aved, than tho&s;e who live in heatheni&s;h darkne&s;s, as all allow. And yet it will be as readily granted that go&s;pel &s;inners are, in general at lea&s;t, much more guilty and odious in the &s;ight of God, than the heathen.</P>
<P>As Mr. M. goes on to illu&s;trate this ab&s;urdity by in&s;tancing in two per&s;ons, brought up under the &s;ame external light and advantages; one is a &s;ecure profligate, the other is under great awakenings and convictions of con&s;cience. The latter he &s;ays, according to me, is mo&s;t likely to be &s;aved; and yet is by far the mo&s;t guilty and odious of the two. Well, what then? There is nothing &s;hocking or ab&s;urd in this, more than there is in the ca&s;e ju&s;t now mentioned; unle&s;s it be in what ari&s;es from his dre&s;&s;ing up the latter in an innocent favourable light, and &s;etting out the former in mo&s;t mon&s;trous colours; and then &s;uppo&s;ing him to be much more vile and odious than the other: yea, "the mo&s;t vile, odious and abominable &s;inner on the face of the whole earth." He repre&s;ents the lat|ter in the following words, <Q>From early childhood he has con&s;tantly paid &s;uch <HI>reverence</HI> and <HI>obedience</HI> to the dictates of con&s;cience, as hath nouri&s;hed the greate&s;t degrees of tenderne&s;s to regard all duty, and avoid all &s;in that can agree to an unregenerate &s;tate.</Q> In this way of &s;tating the matter, Mr. M. has been guilty of two things.</P>
<P N="1">1. He has entirely mi&s;repre&s;ented the matter in di&s;pute between us, by dre&s;&s;ing up the awakened, convinced &s;inner unregenerate in &s;uch fine colours, as do not belong to him: for &s;uch an one in&s;tead of reve|rencing and obeying his con&s;cience, lives in the greate&s;t &s;in, in oppo|&s;ition to the dictates of his con&s;cience, and a thou&s;and times as much light as others have; and in&s;tead of paying any "regard to all duty" he has no true regard to any duty at all, as &s;uch, but really refu&s;es to do the whole that God commands. This mi&s;repre&s;entation, as has been ob&s;erved, runs thro' the whole of Mr. M. books. I mention this as a &s;pecimen.</P>
<P N="2">2. He has hereby really gone off from the point he was profe&s;&s;edly attending to, viz. That they who are mo&s;t likely to be &s;aved, are pro|portionably more guilty and vile in God's &s;ight than they were; and has lead the attention of his reader to quite another thing, viz. The ab|&s;urdity of &s;uppo&s;ing the convinced &s;inner, &s;o much more vile and odious than the other. I think this is indeed to "remove as far as po&s;&s;ible from all REASONING, ab&s;tru&s;e, metaphy&s;ical" or any other.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="011295_0036_0F869EEB471D7110">
And thus having quite forgot the argument he was upon, he leads his reader a jaunt into the heathen world to &s;hew him who is the vile&s;t among them, upon my principles. I &s;ay, he quite forgot the argument he was upon; for among the heathen one is not more likely to be &s;aved than another, which was the only point he was now profe&s;&s;edly attend|ing to. But to pa&s;s this, if we particularly follow him in his ramble, we &s;hall find him here guilty of a very gro&s;s ab&s;urdity (I leave it to the reader, whether it does not weigh down all that he attempted to fa&s;ten upon me) it is this, he finds a heathen, who "comes up neare&s;t to the dictates of con&s;cience," and yet "in failing to come up to his duty he &s;ins again&s;t the greate&s;t light." How he &s;ins again&s;t the greate&s;t light, in not coming up to his duty, who "comes up neare&s;t to the dictates of his con&s;cience" it is difficult to &s;ay.</P>
<P>In the clo&s;e of this argument, Mr. M. adds, <Q>It is needle&s;s to ob|&s;erve here, that the&s;e things never did agree to the common &s;en&s;e of mankind; or of the chri&s;tian world: and to my weak under&s;tand|ing, I mu&s;t &s;ay, they &s;ound too &s;trange to be true.</Q> I agree with Mr. M. that this ob&s;ervation was <HI>quite needle&s;s,</HI> &s;eeing all the appearance of ab&s;urdities is owing to his departing from the dictates of common &s;en&s;e, to rai&s;e a &s;care-crow to fright the unwary reader. And whether his taking &s;uch pains to frame &s;uch ab&s;urdities as the&s;e, is to be attribu|ted to his <HI>weak under&s;tanding,</HI> of which he &s;o often boa&s;ts, or to a mi&s;improvement of what he has, I leave the reader to judge.</P>
<P>Mr. MILL'S &s;econd argument is from two pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is in there words, "The men of Nineveh &s;hall ri&s;e in judg|ment with this generation, and &s;hall condemn it; becau&s;e they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and behold a greater than Jonas is here."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mat. XII. 41.</NOTE></P>
<P>He forms an argument from the&s;e words in the following manner. The repentance of the Ninevites, upon the preaching of Jonas, &s;hall condemn the Jews for not repenting as the Ninevites did, tho' they were under the preaching of Chri&s;t. Now the repentance of the Ni|nevites was only a legal repentance, by which they were brought to the &s;tate of awakened, convinced &s;inners. It hence follows that the awakened, convinced &s;inner is not more vile in God's &s;ight than the unawakened, &s;ecure &s;inner: for then the Ninevites coming to this &s;tate, in which they on the whole become more vile, than they were before, even in a &s;tate of &s;ecurity and open wickedne&s;s, could not condemn the Jews for not repenting as the Ninevites did.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 23, 24.</NOTE></P>
<P>ANS. 1. The Ninevites were not awakened, convinced &s;inners in the &s;en&s;e in which I &s;peak of &s;uch; &s;o no argument can be formed from them in this ca&s;e. Mr. M. him&s;elf &s;ays, in a marginal note under this argument, <Q>They were in the depth of heatheni&s;h darkne&s;s, and for any thing we know, had not &s;o much as the name of a mediator, to be believed on among them.</Q> If this was their ca&s;e they were not capable of that &s;in, in which I con&s;tantly place the greater guilt and vilene&s;s of awakened, convinced &s;inners under the go&s;pel, viz. in their per&s;i&s;ting in an impenitent rejecting and hating of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in op|po&s;ition to the light of their own con&s;ciences. The Ninevites, accor|ding

to Mr. M. had no degree of this light and conviction; therefore were not in a capacity to &s;in again&s;t it, and &s;o become more guilty and vile, in con&s;equence of their awakening and conviction. The Nine|vites, if Mr. M's account of them is right, acted fully up to the light and conviction of their con&s;ciences, and did all that they knew was re|quired of them, and that was nece&s;&s;ary in order to their e&s;caping the divine judgments threatened. Mr. M. was &s;urely quite inattentive to the ca&s;e before him, and wholly overlooked the character of the awa|kened, convinced, unregenerate &s;inner under the go&s;pel, or he would have known that the ca&s;e of the Ninevites was very far from being any thing to his purpo&s;e; and that the argument he has formed from them, is extremely weak, and altogether inconclu&s;ive.</P>
<P>ANS. 2d. All that Jonah &s;aid to the Ninevites was, "Yet forty days and Nineveh &s;hall be overthrown." This was all the light and in|&s;truction he gave them. They believed him, that they &s;hould be de|&s;troyed, unle&s;s they reformed the&s;e open &s;ins, by which their con&s;ci|ences told them they had provoked God. The&s;e they reformed im|mediately: and thus they hearkened to Jonah, as they under&s;tood him; they believed his words, and they were influenced by them, according to the light and dictates of their con&s;ciences. Chri&s;t, a greater than Jonah, came to the Jews, with much greater and more &s;triking evidence that he was &s;ent of God, than Jonah had; but the Jews did not believe him and comply with his in&s;tructions, invitations and warnings. They did not come to that repentance which Chri&s;t called them to; but per&s;i&s;ted in rejecting him. With great propriety then did Chri&s;t addre&s;s the Jews in the&s;e words, "The men of Nine|veh &s;hall ri&s;e in judgment with this generation and &s;hall condemn it, &amp;c. As if he had &s;aid, "The men of Nineveh &s;hall be an in&s;tance by which this generation &s;hall be condemned in the day of judgment; for they hearkened to Jonah and regarded him, when he was &s;ent to them, as they under&s;tood him; but this generation refu&s;e to hearken to me, and continue impenitent under all my in&s;tructions &amp; warnings."</P>
<P>ANS. 3d. In the&s;e words our Saviour has no reference to the real, internal character of the men of Nineveh whether they were &s;inners in their repentance or not, whether they were, on the whole, more guilty and vile, or le&s;s than they were before Jonah came among them. All that was to his purpo&s;e is, that the men of Nineveh hearkened to the preaching of Jonah, and repented vi&s;ibly; whereas the Jews did not hearken to Chri&s;t, but vi&s;ibly oppo&s;ed and rejected him. Chri&s;t &s;peaks of nothing but their external appearance and conduct, without deter|mining what they were at heart. This is evident from the words im|mediately following with re&s;pect to the queen of the &s;outh. We can|not infer that &s;he came to hear the wi&s;dom of Solomon from any pious and good end, or that &s;he was on the whole le&s;s vile than if &s;he had not &s;een Solomon and heard his wi&s;dom, becau&s;e Chri&s;t &s;ays her coming to hear the wi&s;dom of Solomon &s;hall condemn the Jews, who de&s;pi&s;ed and rejected one &s;o much greater than Solomon. She in fact paid more regard to Solomon, than the Jews did to Chri&s;t, and this was fully to

his purpo&s;e, let her act from what principles &s;he would, and what ever was the con&s;equence to her; he having regard only to that which was vi&s;ible in her, from the hi&s;tory of her, and not to that of which we have no account. And in the &s;ame manner he &s;peaks of the Ninevites.</P>
<P>THE other pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture Mr. M. mentions under this argument&punc; is what Chri&s;t &s;ays to the &s;cribe in con&s;equence of his an&s;wering the que&s;|tion which he was then attending to, "di&s;creetly," i. e. under&s;tandingly, "Thou art not far from the kingdom of God." Mr. M. in&s;i&s;ts upon it, that the&s;e words mu&s;t mean that tho' he was not a good man; yet he was le&s;s &s;inful in the &s;tate of his mind, and &s;o nearer the &s;tate of a good man, on account of the attainments he had arrived to, than tho&s;e who were de&s;titute of the&s;e, or than he would have been in their ab&s;ence. Hence he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, "that all awakened, reformed &s;inners under the go&s;pel a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, on the whole, more vile in God's &s;ight, than when &s;ecure and at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, going on in their &s;ins under the &s;ame external means of light.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 24&mdash;28.</NOTE></P>
<P>His argument to prove that by his being not far from the kingdom of God con&s;i&s;ted in his being le&s;s &s;inful in the &s;tate of his mind, and in this re&s;pect, not far from the &s;tate of a good man, is, that he could not be &s;aid to be &s;o in any other &s;en&s;e. He particularly &s;ays, by this cannot be meant, <Q>That he was merely more likely to be converted, without re|&s;pect had to any of tho&s;e things, by which; con&s;idered in them&s;elves, he was le&s;s &s;inful, &s;ince 'tis evident from the expre&s;s letter of the &s;a|cred text, that in what is &s;aid of the &s;cribe's being nigh or not far from the kingdom of God, re&s;pect is had to tho&s;e things, and tho&s;e only, by which, con&s;idered in them&s;elves, he was le&s;s &s;inful.</Q></P>
<P>On this it may be ob&s;erved in the fir&s;t place, that in this he only begs the que&s;tion, and proves nothing. The que&s;tion is, in what &s;en&s;e the &s;cribe was not far from the kingdom of God, and what Chri&s;t has re&s;pect to in the&s;e words? Mr. M. &s;ays, he had re&s;pect to tho&s;e things, and tho&s;e only, by which, con&s;idered in them&s;elves, he was le&s;s &s;inful; and that "this is evident from the expre&s;s letter of the &s;acred text." But this is the very thing in di&s;pute. Chri&s;t has re&s;pect to the words of the &s;cribe, in which he di&s;covered his &s;entiments to be right with re&s;pect to a very important truth, and which, if followed in all its ju&s;t con&s;equences, would lead him to the mo&s;t important doctrines of chri&s;tianity. But that this orthodoxy in &s;peculation implied any thing with re&s;pect to the &s;tate of his mind, as being more or le&s;s &s;inful, Mr. M. has not proved, but takes wholly for granted, and founds his argument upon it.</P>
<P>I had &s;aid that orthodoxy or right &s;peculative knowledge brings a man nearer to the kingdom of God, or renders him more likely to be &s;aved than if he had it not, let the &s;tate of his mind, his heart, be more or le&s;s &s;inful. And here is an in&s;tance to my purpo&s;e, if Mr. M. rightly under&s;tands the phra&s;e, "thou art not far from the kingdom of God." Here is a per&s;on of whom Chri&s;t &s;ays this merely upon his appearing to be right in his &s;peculations in an important point, and the text &s;ays not a word of any thing el&s;e. But Mr. M. mu&s;t bring into the account &s;omething good in his heart, or at lea&s;t le&s;s &s;inful, becau&s;e he could not, upon his plan be nearer the kingdom of God than others without this. But this is to beg the que&s;tion, as I have ob&s;erved. Mr. M. had ob&s;erv|ed,
<PB N="68" REF="011295_0038_0F869EECEFF95F40">
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 22.</NOTE> that to be in my language "more likely to be &s;aved," was in the phra&s;e of our Saviour, to be "nearer the kingdom of God." Had he kept this in view he might ea&s;ily have &s;een in what &s;en&s;e the &s;cribe might be nearer the kingdom of God, by the degree of &s;peculative knowledge he appeared to have, without concerning him&s;elf with the &s;tate of his heart, and contriving to make that le&s;s &s;inful, from a text which &s;ays not a word about it. At lea&s;t, he &s;hould have proved that he could not be nearer the kingdom of heaven in that &s;en&s;e, in&s;tead of pa&s;&s;ing it over in &s;ilence, as if there could be no &s;uch &s;en&s;e put upon the words.</P>
<P>But Mr. M. &s;eems to take it for granted (for he has not &s;aid a word to prove it) that the &s;peculative knowledge which the &s;cribe appeared to have, implied &s;omething good, or le&s;s bad and &s;inful in the &s;tate and temper of his mind. But this is contrary to all rea&s;on, and to known fact. If he will prove this to be true, that mens hearts are le&s;s &s;inful and come nearer to the temper and exerci&s;es of good men, in proportion as their judgment and con&s;ciences are convinced, and they advance in right &s;pe|culative notions of the truths of divine revelation: I &s;ay, if he will <HI>prove</HI> this, he will gain his point, and entirely overthrow what he has underta|ken to di&s;pute again&s;t; Yea, he will confute what St. Paul him&s;elf has a&s;&s;erted. For if men unregenerate in all ca&s;es grow le&s;s &s;inful, as light and conviction of con&s;cience increa&s;es, then certainly they are not more guilty and vile: Nor can any one "hold the truth in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s," as St. Paul &s;ays many did.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. I. 18.</NOTE></P>
<P>It appears therefore in every view that Mr. M. has here only begged the whole of the que&s;tion in di&s;pute between us.</P>
<P>And he has done more than this; he has gro&s;sly contradicted him&s;elf, and that two ways. He has &s;aid,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 61.</NOTE> <Q>It is evident and certain that every degree of <HI>knowledge,</HI> &amp;c. attained by the unregenerate, that is nece&s;&s;ary, in order to a &s;tate of grace and &s;alvation, brings them in &s;tate one de|gree nearer to it.</Q> But here he takes it for granted a per&s;on cannot be &s;aid to be nearer the kingdom of heaven, on account of his knowledge. Again, he el&s;e where finds fault with me that I &s;peak of &s;peculative knowledge only, and not of any reformation of the &s;inner, as rendering him more likely to be &s;aved;<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">P. 58.</NOTE> where he &s;uppo&s;es there is no connexion between any &s;peculative knowledge of the unregenerate, and any degree of reformation, and that the latter is no ways implied in the former: But here he takes it for granted that &s;peculative knowledge, or light in the under&s;tanding does imply &s;omething good in heart, or a le&s;s degree of &s;infulne&s;s, &amp; that it nece&s;&s;arily brings a per&s;on to a &s;tate of mind, nearer to that of a good man. Yea, that this is one of tho&s;e things, by which, con|&s;idered in it&s;elf, a man is le&s;s &s;inful; for he &s;ays Chri&s;t has re&s;pect to &s;uch things <HI>only.</HI> Men who will make &s;uch &s;uppo&s;itions, and &s;uppo&s;e and take for granted the whole matter in di&s;pute, and ground an argument on that, and at the &s;ame time contradict them&s;elves &s;o many ways, as it were in the &s;ame <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th, will, in their way prove any thing they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve, in the next place, upon the pa&s;&s;age quoted, that he &s;ays, "'tis evident, that in what is &s;aid of the &s;cribe's being nigh, or not far from the kingdom of God, re&s;pect is had to tho&s;e things, and tho&s;e things

only, by which <HI>con&s;idered in them&s;elves,</HI> he was le&s;s &s;inful." The &s;cribe might appear to have many things which, <HI>con&s;idered in them&s;elves,</HI> might be le&s;s &s;inful than &s;omething el&s;e, and yet, on the whole, be more &s;inful and vile than if he had them not. So that what Mr. M here takes for granted, if allowed him as he has expre&s;&s;ed it, makes nothing to his pur|po&s;e. The &s;cribe might notwith&s;tanding all this, be, on the whole, more &s;inful in the &s;tate of his mind, than others, who had not tho&s;e things, by which, <HI>con&s;idered in them&s;elves</HI> they would be le&s;s &s;inful. Suppo&s;e for in|&s;tance, the &s;peculative knowledge which the &s;cribe had was one thing by which, con&s;idered in it&s;elf, he was le&s;s &s;inful; yet if he hated and re|jected Je&s;us Chri&s;t, with all this light and knowledge (which he did, if he was &s;till an unregenerate man) he was, on the whole, a greater &s;inner than they who had not this knowledge. I therefore &s;tand ready to prove that if the &s;cribe was not really a good man, and did not love God, and believe in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, he was on the whole much more &s;inful and vile in the &s;tate and exerci&s;es of his mind, than tho&s;e who were without this &s;peculative knowledge. And I pre&s;ume it is impo&s;&s;ible that any one &s;hould find any thing in this text contrary to this.</P>
<P>Mr. M. in order to make the&s;e words of Chri&s;t an&s;wer his purpo&s;e, &s;uppo&s;es the &s;cribe to be unregenerate, and yet not prejudiced again&s;t Chri&s;t, but in an awakened reformed &s;tate; and that in this &s;tate his heart was le&s;s &s;inful, and not far from a &s;tate of grace; and concludes that the kingdom of God means a &s;tate of grace. All the&s;e things he lays as the foundation to build his conclu&s;ion upon. All of which have not the lea&s;t evidence to &s;upport them. Surely that mu&s;t be a very weak, flim&s;y argument which is built wholly on &s;uch a number of precarious, uncer|tain &s;uppo&s;itions. And he mu&s;t be at a great lo&s;s for &s;criptures to argue from, who can find none more to his purpo&s;e than this.</P>
<P>By the kingdom of God here may be meant the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation; or the vi&s;ible kingdom which Chri&s;t was &s;etting up, as this is very com|monly the meaning of this phra&s;e. And the &s;cribe might be a man of true piety on the Jewi&s;h plan; but had not yet been under advantage to &s;atisfy him&s;elf about the character of Chri&s;t and his doctrines. If it &s;hould be objected to this, that St. Matthew &s;ays this very &s;cribe, a&s;ked Chri&s;t this que&s;tion, <HI>tempting him.</HI> I an&s;wer, this may be under&s;tood not in a bad &s;en&s;e; it may only mean, that he a&s;ked this que&s;tion to try him, and &s;ee what his opinion was on this point, that he might be the better able to form a judgment of him. If the&s;e words are not under&s;tood in this &s;en&s;e, they are not con&s;i&s;tent with his being <HI>near</HI> the &s;tate of a good man, as Mr. M. &s;uppo&s;es him to be. In &s;hort, there is as much evidence that he was <HI>quite</HI> a pious, good man, as there is that he was &s;o <HI>near</HI> to this as Mr. M. &s;ays he was, and he has been perfectly arbitrary in bring|ing him &s;o near the &s;tate of a good man, and yet not allowing him to be really good. If he was a good man, the meaning of Chri&s;t's words to him is, "I find you have &s;o much light and knowledge, that you want only to be a little more acquainted with me and my doctrines, in order to be one of my di&s;ciples, a profe&s;&s;ed member of that kingdom, which the Me&s;&s;iah is now about to &s;et up."</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="011295_0039_0F869EF0DE1A5450">
But, after all, it is my opinion, that as we know nothing of the cha|racter of this &s;cribe but what appears in his putting a que&s;tion to Chri&s;t, and approving of his an&s;wer, and making an observation upon it; and it is expre&s;sly &s;aid that the reply of our Lord was grounded entirely on his an&s;wer, Chri&s;t has reference to this only, and declares that this im|portant &s;entiment, in which he appeared to be &s;o full and clear, compre|hended &s;o much, and was in &s;uch a degree the foundation of all he taught; that he was hereby in a great mea&s;ure prepared to under&s;tand all the doctrines nece&s;&s;ary to be known and believed, in order to be a member of his kingdom; and in this re&s;pect was not far from the kingdom of God.</P>
<P>But if this is not the true meaning of the&s;e words, and they mu&s;t in|tend a nearne&s;s to a &s;tate of grace and &s;alvation, there is not the lea&s;t e|vidence that this con&s;i&s;ted in any good, or le&s;s &s;inful di&s;po&s;ition of mind by which he was not far from the temper and exerci&s;es of a good man, and more di&s;po&s;ed heartily to embrace the go&s;pel, than any other unre|generate man, as has been ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>Mr. M. and others have taken it for granted, that a per&s;on, in order to be more likely to be &s;aved than others; or to be in any true &s;en&s;e not far from the kingdom of God, mu&s;t be in &s;ome degree well di&s;po&s;ed, or le&s;s inclined to &s;in, and le&s;s oppo&s;ite to God and holine&s;s, and &s;o a much le&s;s &s;inner than others: Hence when they read this text, and find one pronounced not far from the kingdom of God, by Chri&s;t, they conclude he was a man of a good di&s;po&s;ition, almo&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to embrace the go&s;|pel, tho' not one word is &s;aid about it in the text.</P>
<P>On this plan he has the lea&s;t ground to hope for &s;alvation, who views him&s;elf to be a greater &s;inner than others: Yea he cannot rea&s;onably have any hope until he has a better opinion of him&s;elf, and thinks him&s;elf bet|ter than any who &s;hall finally peri&s;h. And every one who is under the government of the &s;ame &s;pirit, which Chri&s;t points out in the Phari&s;ee, who went up to the temple to pray, may have high hopes of &s;alvation, and &s;well in his confidence that he is not &s;o bad as other men. But this notion, &s;o far as it is received, will &s;trike death to all the hopes, of every per&s;on, who is of a different and oppo&s;ite &s;pirit.</P>
<P>And indeed, if the &s;cribe by his &s;peculations and the right notions which he appeared to have, was become le&s;s &s;inful and oppo&s;ite to God and the go&s;pel, and not far from a &s;tate of grace, or true holine&s;s in the &s;tate and exerci&s;es of his heart, which mu&s;t imply, at lea&s;t, that he was got much above half way to it; no rea&s;on can be given why he might not &s;oon arrive to the &s;tate and exerci&s;es of a good man, by making a little more progre&s;s in his pre&s;ent cour&s;e and advancing in the &s;ame kind of light and knowledge, and di&s;po&s;ition of mind, which he now had in &s;uch a con&s;iderable degree. If he had got &s;o near to real holine&s;s, as not to be far from it, the greate&s;t difficulty was over, and a few &s;teps more in the &s;ame cour&s;e in which he had hitherto proceeded, would have brought him completely into the kingdom of God.</P>
<P>Mr. MILLS'S third argument,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 28, 29, 30.</NOTE> con&s;i&s;ts in &s;tating the matter in di&s;pute between us, as he &s;ays, "in a fair light," and then "appealing to the ju|dicious reader" to judge, who is on the right &s;ide of the que&s;tion. This,
<PB N="71" REF="011295_0039_0F869EF0DE1A5450">
I confe&s;s, appears to me to be &s;omewhat of an odd argument, and to be expre&s;&s;ed in a very round-about, intricate way: However we mu&s;t make the be&s;t of it that we can.</P>
<P>I agree with him that the only point to be determined, as that on which the whole controver&s;y turns, is, Whether the &s;in and guilt, which the awakened, convinced, unregenerate &s;inner exerci&s;es and contracts in con|&s;equence of the light and conviction that he has, and which he was not chargeable with in a &s;tate of ignorance and &s;ecurity, are &s;o great as to over balance all his external reformations, be they as great as they will, &s;o that on the whole he is now more guilty and vile, than he was before, even in the practice of all that external wickedne&s;s, which he has now for&s;aken? Mr. M. has not &s;tated the point in the&s;e words; but I con|clude this is his meaning.</P>
<P>I have particularly and largely con&s;idered this matter in &s;ome of the foregoing &s;ections: And I am willing to join i&s;&s;ue with Mr. M. here, and appeal to the judicious reader, who has carefully attended to what has been &s;aid.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t beg leave to ob&s;erve that what Mr. M. calls "&s;etting this matter in a fair light," is really a gro&s;s mi&s;repre&s;entation of it. Of this the "judicious reader" will be &s;en&s;ible, without my &s;aying a word upon it: but he who is not &s;o, will be in danger of being deceived by it. For the &s;ake of &s;uch therefore, I would &s;ay a few things, to prevent the influ|ence which it might otherwi&s;e have on them.</P>
<P N="1">1. He has not &s;et the aggravated &s;in and guilt of the awakened con|vinced &s;inner in a true light; or rather has not brought it into view at all, in the whole that he has &s;aid. He indeed &s;peaks of "the additional &s;in, ari&s;ing merely from that &s;en&s;ibility of con&s;cience, whereby the awak|ened &s;inner reforms ALL known &s;in." But there can be no "additional &s;in" in this &s;tate of the ca&s;e; for the &s;inner is &s;uppo&s;ed to act up to the &s;en&s;ibility and light of his con&s;cience, in reforming <HI>all known &s;in.</HI> Such an one is either not an awakened convinced &s;inner, becau&s;e he does not know that unbelief and rejecting, having and oppo&s;ing Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is a &s;in, and by far the greate&s;t of which he can be guilty; or he does em|brace the go&s;pel, and &s;o is not unregenerate. The awakened, convinced &s;inner is &s;o far from reforming <HI>all</HI> known &s;in, that he is con&s;tantly guilty of a thou&s;and times more known &s;in, than he was, or could be, before he was thus awakened and convinced, and the actual hardne&s;s and rebellion of his heart is immen&s;ely increa&s;ed. This is kept wholly out of view by Mr. M. Yea, his repre&s;entation is in direct oppo&s;ition to this; and &s;o mo&s;t contrary to the truth. This he has done thro' his whole book, as has been before ob&s;erved. And he here, and every where el&s;e, puts "&s;en|&s;ibility of con&s;cience" in oppo&s;ition to "hardne&s;s of heart," and a "hard|ned &s;tate," which is contrary to the truth, and only tends to mi&s;lead the unwary reader; The awakened, convinced &s;inner has as much hardne&s;s of heart, and is as really in a hard<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d &s;tate, as the &s;ecure &s;inner, if by hard heart is meant a rebellious, ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">te heart, which is the meaning of the word in &s;cripture: yea, his heart<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> harder, than it was in a &s;tate of &s;ecurity, as much greater degrees of light and conviction are now let into his mind.</P>

2. He has not &s;et the &s;tate of the unawakened, &s;ecure &s;inner in a ju&s;t light. This appears in what has been ju&s;t ob&s;erved of his repre&s;enting him, as having hardne&s;s of heart, and being in an hardened &s;tate, as differ|ing herein from the awakened, convinced &s;inner. The &s;ecure &s;inner is indeed in a hardened &s;tate, but not more &s;o, nor &s;o much, as the awaken|ed convinced &s;inner. The former would be as much awakened, and con|cerned about him&s;elf as the latter, had he as much light in his mind and con&s;cience, but this would not remove the lea&s;t degree of hardne&s;s of heart, but be the occa&s;ion of increa&s;ing it.</P>
<P>Again, he repre&s;ents the &s;ecure &s;inner as committing all his open wick|edne&s;s "pre&s;umptuou&s;ly, not only again&s;t the light of God's word, but again&s;t the <HI>clear</HI> dictates of natural con&s;cience." It is doubtle&s;s true in general, of &s;ecure profligates, under the go&s;pel, that they &s;in more or le&s;s again&s;t the dictates of their con&s;cience. But the light and dictates of their con&s;ciences are very weak and faint; and they &s;eldom attend to this matter, or think any thing about it, and are not convinced that there is really much harm in what they do. They have no reallizing ap|prehen&s;ion, that they &s;hall be called to an account for what they are doing, and be puni&s;hed for it. This mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed; for in proportion as their con&s;ciences dictate this, they will be awakened and concerned. They cannot therefore be properly &s;aid to &s;in again&s;t the <HI>clear</HI> dictates of natural con&s;cience. To be &s;ure they cannot be &s;aid to do &s;o in di&s;tincti|on from the convinced &s;inner: for, as has been ob&s;erved, the latter &s;ins a thou&s;and times as much again&s;t his con&s;cience as the former, and again&s;t immen&s;ely clearer light and dictates of con&s;cience, both with re&s;pect to what is &s;in, and what are the ju&s;t con&s;equences of it.</P>
<P>As to what he &s;ays,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 30.</NOTE> that he has "<HI>clearly &s;hewed</HI> that the degree of wickedne&s;s in <HI>Chorazian</HI> and <HI>Beth&s;aida,</HI> above <HI>Tyre</HI> and <HI>Sidon,</HI> con&s;i&s;ted in a greater degree of &s;tupidity and hardne&s;s of heart in the former, where|by they were more unimpre&s;&s;ible than the latter, the &s;ame external means and advantages to repent being &s;uppo&s;ed:" I tru&s;t the reader who has attended to what I have already &s;aid upon this ca&s;e, will not think he has given the lea&s;t evidence of it.</P>
<P>MR. MILLS'S fourth argument con&s;i&s;ts in &s;hewing, <Q>Of what account the&s;e characters are with the ble&s;&s;ed God, and how he treats them in his word and providence, viz. That of the awakened &s;inner, brought, tho' on principles of nature, to humble him&s;elf before God, repent, reform known evils, and con&s;cientiou&s;ly attend known duties; and that of the &s;tout hearted, bold, daring, hardened &s;inner, that ob&s;tinate|ly per&s;i&s;ts in all manner of vitious and immoral pactices, under the &s;ame external means of light, and again&s;t the clear dictates of his con&s;ci|ence.</Q></P>
<P>The reader will ob&s;erve in what colours the&s;e different characters are &s;et; and will be &s;en&s;ible, I tru&s;t, that there are no &s;uch different characters of the unregenerate; which I have endeavoured to &s;hew heretofore. The awakened &s;inner never does <HI>humble him&s;elf before God,</HI> but is quite as far from this as the &s;ecure profligate: Yea, the pride and &s;tubbornne&s;s of the former, is exerci&s;ed in a higher degree, and more directly again&s;t
<PB N="73" REF="011295_0040_0F869EF1958BBB58">
God, than that of the latter. And he does not con&s;cientiou&s;ly attend known duties: for under <HI>true</HI> convictions, he knows that he really does no duty at all, has never done any thing that God commands, or paid the lea&s;t obedience to him in one in&s;tance: And his con&s;cience tells him of a thou&s;and times more duty to God, which he with ob&s;tinacy, and knowingly refu&s;es to do, than the &s;ecure &s;inner ever thought of. And the former appears to be a more <HI>&s;tout-hearted, bold, daring, hardened &s;inner,</HI> than the latter, as he "ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ts" in the highe&s;t crimes, the mo&s;t heaven daring &s;in that men can be guilty of; and voluntarily goes on in the way to de&s;truction, with his eyes, as it were, wide open, and under all the awakenings and terrors of his con&s;cience, in a view of the awful con&s;equence of his rebellion, and in the &s;ight of an angry God, and dreadful hell.</P>
<P>But let us attend to the argument. He goes on to &s;ay, <Q>If we can find clearly of what account the&s;e characters are with the omni&s;cient God, we &s;hall find what they really are, and a more &s;ure ground to form our judgment concerning them, than all our weak rea&s;onings can otherwi&s;e furni&s;h us with. I &s;hall therefore touch on a few in|&s;tances of each kind, as exhibited in the holy &s;criptures.</Q></P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e I have already &s;ufficiently &s;hewed from the &s;cripture, how the&s;e characters &s;tand in God's &s;ight. However we will attend to Mr. M's in&s;tances; for I doubt not we &s;hall get &s;ome light hereby.</P>
<P>HE fir&s;t undertakes to produce in&s;tances "of awakened, humbled, reformed &s;inners. He in&s;tances in Ahab, Jehu, the Ninevites, and the children of I&s;rael at Mount-Sinai. Of Ahab he ob&s;erves, that when he rent his cloaths, &amp;c. in con&s;equence of the terrible me&s;&s;age delivered to him by the prophet; the Lord <HI>took this favourable notice of it,</HI> and de|ferred the evil threatned; "&s;ee&s;t thou how Ahab humbleth him&s;elf be|fore me? Becau&s;e he humbleth him&s;elf before me, I will not bring the evil in his days."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Kings XXI. 25, 29.</NOTE> He appeals to all, whether it can be &s;uppo&s;ed that Ahab was not le&s;s &s;inful and vile, when he thus humbled him&s;elf, &s;ince God <HI>takes &s;uch favourable notice of it,</HI> and out of re&s;pect to this, defers the evil threatned&punc; He al&s;o ob&s;erves concerning Jehu, that <Q>it is evi|dent from God's <HI>expre&s;s approbation,</HI> and the be&s;towment of &s;o great, tho' outward favor, becau&s;e he had done well, that in God's account, his obedience, tho' but the matter of duty, upon principles of nature, was le&s;s wicked than a total di&s;regard to GOD'S command would have been.</Q> And his argument is to the &s;ame purpo&s;e from the ca&s;e of the Ninevites, whom God &s;pared, and granted them a great &s;alvati|on, out of re&s;pect to their repentance, which he concludes was not a gracious repentance</P>
<P>Upon this the following things may be ob&s;erved.</P>
<P N="1">1. If God granted favors to Ahab and Jehu, and a great deliverance and &s;alvation to the Ninevites purely out of re&s;pect to their repentance and good deeds, while they were impenitent, unbelievers, and enemies to God and his Son the Mediator; then he may and does &s;hew favor to &s;inners out of re&s;pect to what they are in them&s;elves, their exerci&s;es and doings, and without any relation and re&s;pect to Chri&s;t the Media|tor.
<PB N="74" REF="011295_0041_0F869EF2036B3A98">
Therefore if there was no &s;uch Mediator he might &s;hew favors to &s;inners, take a favourable notice of their doings, and expre&s;s and manife&s;t his approbation of them, and purely out of re&s;pect to this &s;u&s;|pend his puni&s;hments, and grant them pardon and &s;alvation. For if he grants a le&s;s good, a le&s;s deliverance and &s;alvation, out of re&s;pect to their character and doings, becau&s;e they have done well, or have be|come le&s;s &s;inful, than they were; he may as well grant a greater good, even pardon of all &s;in and eternal &s;alvation, out of re&s;pect to this; e&s;|pecially if they &s;hould become really virtuous and obedient, from the highe&s;t and be&s;t principles. If Ahab, for in&s;tance, obtained the divine approbation, and God's favorable notice, &s;o as to have the awful judg|ments threatned, &s;u&s;pended, and removed from him, only by becoming in &s;ome degree le&s;s &s;inful, in being filled with fears of temporal evil, while he remained yet an enemy to God; how much higher mu&s;t he have ri&s;en in God's favor, had he truly repented and humbled him&s;elf before God and returned to obedience from the noble&s;t principles, lov|ing God with all his heart and &s;oul! Surely, if what he did, was &s;uf|ficient to abate God's anger towards him, and obtain his approbation and favor &s;o far as to remove the heavy judgment from him which was threatened; had he made advances in his goodne&s;s, &s;o as to become perfectly friendly and obedient to God, it would have been &s;ufficient; quite to remove God's anger, and atone for all his pa&s;t &s;ins, and pro|cure God's highe&s;t approbation and favor. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation is ju&s;t when applied to Jehu and the Ninevites.</P>
<P>If Ahab abated the divine di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t him, and obtained God's approbation and favor in any degree, by the alteration of his character and conduct, and purely on this account; Then this did &s;o far atone for his &s;ins, and render his per&s;on, and character, the whole taken to|gether, le&s;s di&s;plea&s;ing, and more acceptable to God. What need then did Ahab &s;tand in of the atonement and merit of a Mediator, in order to obtain the acceptance of his per&s;on, and pardon of his &s;ins, and the favour of God? He had obtained this in &s;ome degree purely by his own reformations and doings; and nothing could be in the way of his obtaining it in as high a degree as he needed, if he went on in his re|formation and obedience to higher degrees. Therefore no &s;inner wants any other atonement and righteou&s;ne&s;s in order to obtain pardon and &s;tand compleat in God's favor, but what is contained in his own refor|mations and obedience.</P>
<P>Thus Mr M. in his zeal in the cau&s;e of his awakened, reformed, humbled &s;inner, has quite &s;apped the foundation of the doctrine of atonement by a mediator; and &s;o has overthrown the whole go&s;pel, and repre&s;ented Chri&s;t as dying in vain! He has done this, I believe, without de&s;ign, not really knowing what he was about, as many others have done before him: but he, and every one el&s;e, may be challenged to &s;hew the need, the propriety and wi&s;dom of the atonement which Chri&s;t has made, if &s;inners out of Chri&s;t, wholly unconnected with him and his enemies, may abate the divine di&s;plea&s;ure, and obtain God's approbation and favor purely by their own reformations and doings and wholly out of re&s;pect to them.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="011295_0041_0F869EF2036B3A98">
This is what the awakened &s;inner is at heart de&s;iring and &s;eeking af|ter; nothing would plea&s;e him better, than to obtain God's approbati|on and favour by his own reformation and doings. He always will be of this di&s;po&s;ition as long as he views him&s;elf in the light Mr. M. &s;ets Ahab, and till he de&s;pairs of becoming any better or le&s;s &s;inful in this way. And never was one reconciled to the way of &s;alvation by Chri&s;t, till he was not only convinced in his judgment, and con&s;cience, that what Mr: M. has here advanced is not true, but hates and dete&s;ts &s;uch a notion, in his heart.</P>
<P>I therefore &s;cruple not to &s;ay, that Mr. M. has in the pa&s;&s;ages I am con&s;idering, exalted the &s;inner, and e&s;pou&s;ed his cau&s;e, at the expence of the honor and glory of the Mediator and &s;aviour of &s;inners. Yea, that if what he has here advanced is true, Chri&s;t is dead in vain, and &s;inners are in an infinitely le&s;s guilty, mi&s;erable &s;tate, than the preaching of the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, and the atonement by him &s;uppo&s;es them to be. Mr. M. having ob&s;erved concerning the Ninevites, that tho' their repentance did not "proceed from a principle of &s;aving grace, yet a great &s;alvati|on is be&s;towed <HI>out of re&s;pect to it,</HI> and their repentance was made the <HI>only condition</HI> of their great &s;alvation," adds the following words, <Q>And can it agree to the purity of God's nature, to make a greater degree of wickedne&s;s, on the whole, the condition of be&s;towing a great &s;al|vation, tho' of an outward nature? Sure it cannot, &s;ince this would be to manife&s;t &s;ome regard to &s;in, and encourage men to practice it with boldne&s;s.</Q> I think it may be al&s;o with as much propriety a&s;ked, can it agree to the purity of God's nature to make <HI>a le&s;s degree of wick|edne&s;s</HI> the condition, &amp;c.? If <HI>wickedne&s;s</HI> is made the condition, it &s;eems to be no great matter, whether it be greater or le&s;s. Surely to make any degree of wickedne&s;s the condition, "would be to manife&s;t <HI>&s;ome</HI> re|gard to &s;in and &s;o far encourage men to practice it." But, what is infinite|ly wor&s;e, to make the reformations and doings of the &s;inner <HI>the only con|dition,</HI> of any &s;alvation, and to grant it <HI>out of re&s;pect to the&s;e,</HI> and with|out any re&s;pect to Chri&s;t, his merit and righteou&s;ne&s;s, is to &s;et a&s;ide and de&s;troy all law and moral government, and to manife&s;t infinitely le&s;s hatred of &s;in, and to favour it and the &s;inner infinitely more, than becomes the maje&s;ty of heaven; and nothing could tend more to <Q>en|courage men to practice it with boldne&s;s.</Q> I therefore proceed to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="2">2. A very natural and ea&s;y meaning can be put upon the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, con&s;i&s;tently with the doctrine of atonement, and the glory of the Media|tor, and as con&s;i&s;tently with the principle, in oppo&s;ition to which Mr. M. has attempted to &s;et them. God in his conduct towards the&s;e per|&s;ons, and in what he &s;ays of them, has re&s;pect only to what was vi&s;ible, to their external appearance and conduct: So nothing can be inferred from this with re&s;pect to their hearts, whether they were more or le&s;s &s;inful.</P>
<P>Ahab humbled him&s;elf before God in his appearance and vi&s;ible con|duct, and put on the external appearance and profe&s;&s;ion of a true peni|tent; and God who acted not as the &s;earcher of hearts and final Judge,
<PB N="76" REF="011295_0042_0F869EF2BA744B60">
in his treatment of the church and people of I&s;rael, out as their vi&s;ible head and civil governor, and treated them according to their external appearance and profe&s;&s;ion: I &s;ay, God in this character, &s;peaks of Ahab and treats him according to his external appearance and conduct, i. e. as if he had been a true penitent, whether he was really &s;o or not, or whether he was &s;incere or only played the hypocrite. God treated A|hab in this ca&s;e, as he did Jo&s;iah afterwards on the appearance and profe&s;&s;ion he made of repentance and reformation, and renouncing the &s;in of his fathers. God u&s;es much the &s;ame language to him on this occa&s;ion, by Huldah the prophete&s;s, as he does to Ahab; "Becau&s;e thine heart was tender, and thou did&s;t <HI>humble thy&s;elf</HI> before God, when thou heard&s;t his words again&s;t this place, and again&s;t the inhabitants thereof, and <HI>humbled&s;t thy&s;elf before me,</HI> and did&s;t rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I have heard the al&s;o, &s;aith the Lord. Behold I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou &s;halt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither &s;hall thine eyes &s;ee all the evil that I will bring upon this place."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Chron. XXXIV. 27, 28.</NOTE> God treated Ahab as he has obliged profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians to treat one another. If one falls into gro&s;s external &s;in, and after|wards, upon their dealing faithfully with him, returns and &s;ays he re|pents, i. e. puts on this appearance and profe&s;&s;ion, they are to forgive him, and treat him as a true penitent, whatever his heart may be, and tho' he may wickedly di&s;&s;emble in the whole, and his preten&s;ions to repentance be really more criminal than the conduct of which he pro|fe&s;&s;es to repent.</P>
<P>Thus God dealt with the church and people of I&s;rael. When they in profe&s;&s;ion and appearance gave them&s;elves up to God, and &s;olemnly promi&s;ed, "all that the Lord hath &s;aid, we will do and be obedient." He is repre&s;ented as relying on their promi&s;e, and treated them as if they were &s;incere and hearty in this profe&s;&s;ion and appearance. "He &s;aid, &s;urely they are my people, children that will not lie: So he was their Saviour;"<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. LXIII. 8.</NOTE> even when, as the omni&s;cient God, he knew that <Q>they did flatter him with their mouth, and lied unto him with their tongues.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. LXXVIII, 36.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>And thus he treated the Ninevites in his providence, according to their outward appearance and profe&s;&s;ion, agreeable to the general rule of his conduct towards nations and bodies of people, which he had re|vealed. "At what in&s;tant I &s;hall &s;peak concerning a nation, and con|cerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and de&s;troy it: if that nation again&s;t whom I have pronounced, <HI>turn from their evil,</HI> I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them."<NOTE N="&idagger;" PLACE="foot">Jer. XVIII. 7, 8.</NOTE></P>
<P>And when God &s;ays to Jehu, "Becau&s;e thou ha&s;t done well in exe|cuting that which is right in mine eyes,"<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">2 Kings X. 30.</NOTE> he has reference only to his external conduct, &s;peaking to him, and treating him, as if he was as &s;incere and friendly to God in what he did, as he profe&s;&s;ed to be. The&s;e words are therefore con&s;i&s;tent with his being the greate&s;t &s;inner, in the nation at that very time; and mo&s;t odious and abominable in
<PB N="77" REF="011295_0042_0F869EF2BA744B60">
God's &s;ight, in all he did, it being all taken together, nothing but a piece of high-handed wickedne&s;s. This was doubtle&s;s the real truth of the ca&s;e; for at bottom he was no more of a friend to Jehovah than to Baal: and while he was pulling down Baal, and de&s;troying his wor|&s;hippers, and executing vengeance on the hou&s;e of Ahab, he was &s;et|ting him&s;elf up, and regarding only him&s;elf, in oppo&s;ition to Jehovah; and all his pretences of "zeal for the LORD" were nothing, but gro&s;s hypocri&s;y. Who then can think that Jehu was le&s;s &s;inful and vile in God's &s;ight now, than before, as Mr. M. repre&s;ents him to be? And when GOD &s;ays of the children of I&s;rael at Mount-Siani, "They have well &s;aid all that they have &s;poken,"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deut. V. 28.</NOTE> he has reference to their words and profe&s;&s;ion only, and nothing is &s;aid about any thing el&s;e. They had indeed &s;poken well, they had promi&s;ed obedience and &s;aid to Mo&s;es "Speak thou unto us all that the Lord our God &s;hall &s;peak unto thee, and we will hear it and do it." But they had no heart an&s;werable to their words. In the&s;e good words "they did flatter him with their mouth, and lied unto him with their tongues." This is intimated in what God &s;ays to Mo&s;es on this occa&s;ion, "O that there were <HI>&s;uch an heart</HI> in them, that they would keep all my commandments always." It is therefore &s;o far from being true, that the people of I&s;rael were le&s;s vile and &s;inful in God's &s;ight when they &s;aid the&s;e words; and that on this account they had his "expre&s;s approbation, which Mr. M. a&s;&s;erts, that it is certain they were more vile and odious in God's &s;ight, than if they had &s;aid nothing; if gro&s;s and &s;olemn lying and hypocri&s;y is more &s;inful, than to make no profe&s;&s;ion, and tell no lie. The&s;e two la&s;t mentioned in&s;tances are therefore very ill cho&s;en ones to an&s;wer Mr. M's purpo&s;e, whatever are the re&s;t.</P>
<P>But if we &s;et a&s;ide what has been &s;aid in the foregoing ob&s;ervations, and allow that the per&s;ons here mentioned were not &s;o guilty and vile in God's &s;ight as they had been, and that this is expre&s;sly a&s;&s;erted of them all; yet this does not afford the lea&s;t &s;hadow of an argument to prove that an awakened convinced &s;inner, &s;uch an one as I de&s;cribe, is not more guilty and vile in God's &s;ight, than when in a &s;tate of igno|rance and &s;ecurity. For, I have to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="3">3. It does not appear that any of the&s;e were the awakened, convinced &s;inners of which I &s;peak, but the contrary is mo&s;t evident. Let Mr. M. produce as many in&s;tances as he will of per&s;ons becoming le&s;s &s;inful, and growing &s;o much better, as on this account to abate and remove God's anger towards them, and attain his approbation and favor; yet this will be nothing in favor of the cau&s;e he has e&s;pou&s;ed; unle&s;s the&s;e are in&s;tances of the&s;e awakened, convinced &s;inners, about whom is the di&s;pute.</P>
<P>Jehu has not the lea&s;t <HI>appearance</HI> of any awakening and conviction, or humiliation, or &s;o much as external reformation. I therefore a little wonder how Mr. M. happened to think of him for an in&s;tance of an "awakened, humbled reformed &s;inner."</P>
<P>The ca&s;e of the Ninevites has been before con&s;idered; and it appears by the account which Mr. M. gives of them, that they were very far
<PB N="78" REF="011295_0043_0F869EF3EC53ABE8">
from the conviction, of which I &s;peak, being "in the depth of heathen|i&s;h darkne&s;s, and not knowing &s;o much as the name of a Mediator."</P>
<P>The I&s;raelites were terrified and affected by the extraordinary, dread|ful appearances at Mount-Sinai; but that they had much light and conviction let into their con&s;ciences, there is no evidence; but the con|trary is mo&s;t evident. They had no real conviction of con&s;cience, of the &s;infulne&s;s and perver&s;ne&s;s of their own hearts; but thought they were di&s;po&s;ed and ready to do all that God commanded. In&s;tead of having any true light and conviction of con&s;cience, they were va&s;tly ignorant and &s;tupid in this re&s;pect, while they were only alarmed and frighted by the external appearances of Mount-Sinai. Ju&s;t as many per&s;ons now are affrighted by &s;ome imaginary &s;ugge&s;tions and apprehen|&s;ions, and &s;o imagine them&s;elves to be under the awakenings and con|viction of &s;in, which are preparatory to conver&s;ion, and are thought to be &s;o by many others; while they have really no true &s;ight and con|viction of their &s;in and danger, and know not what is their real &s;tate and character. Indeed the I&s;raelites were neither truly "awakened, convinced, humbled, nor reformed; for they directly upon this fell into the gro&s;&s;e&s;t acts of idolatry; they made and wor&s;hipped a golden calf, and in their idolatrous revel "they &s;at down to eat and to drink, and ro&s;e up to play."</P>
<P>Ahab put on the appearance of a true penitent: "He put &s;ack|cloth upon his fle&s;h, and fa&s;ted and lay in &s;ackcloth, and went &s;oftly." And thus he did, in his external appearance, humble him&s;elf before God. But there is not the lea&s;t evidence that he was under what is called legal conviction, or was in any degree troubled, or tho'tful about a future &s;tate; or that he had any right &s;peculative notions of his guilty, lo&s;t, mi&s;erable &s;tate, as a &s;inner, and of the way in which he might ob|tain pardon and &s;alvation. He believed the prophet, that God was angry with him for what he had done in the affair of Naboth's vineyard, and he was afraid of the temporal, worldly evils which were threatened, and put on this appearance of penitence in hopes that hereby the judgments might be averted. He is not therefore an in&s;tance of an awakened, convinced &s;inner: &s;o is not in any degree applicable to the ca&s;e before us, on &s;up|po&s;ition it was certain that he, by what he did, became le&s;s &s;inful. But whether he was a convinced &s;inner or not, as it appears by his after conduct, that he was not a true penitent, we may be very &s;ure that his heart was not an&s;werable to the external appearance he put on, but was directy oppo&s;ite thereto; and therefore that he was guilty of gro&s;s hypocri&s;y, and was more vile and hateful in God's &s;ight, than he was before he had this &s;pecial admonition, and put on this hypocri|tical appearance. How far then is this in&s;tance from being to Mr. M's purpo&s;e!</P>
<P>BUT Mr. M. has more in&s;tances under this head, to which I will now attend. He &s;ays the point he contends for is evident from the repre|&s;entation our Saviour makes of this matter in the following words. <Q>When the unclean &s;pirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through

dry places, &s;eeking re&s;t, and findeth none. Then he &s;aith, I will re|turn to my hou&s;e, from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty &s;wept and garni&s;hed. Then goeth he, and taketh with him &s;even other &s;pirits more wicked than him&s;elf, and they en|ter in, and dwell there: and the la&s;t &s;tate of that man is wor&s;e than the fir&s;t.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mat. XII. 43&mdash;45.</NOTE></Q> He ob&s;erves upon the&s;e words, that, <Q>by the hou&s;e emp|ty &s;wept and garni&s;hed, is repre&s;ented the &s;tate of an awakened, re|formed &s;inner. By his return with &s;even other &s;pirits more wicked than him&s;elf, entering in, and dwelling there, is repre&s;ented the more de&s;perate, wicked &s;tate, to which he is reduced on the abatement of his convictions, returning with further degrees of contracted hardne&s;s of heart, to the unre&s;trained practice of more de&s;perate degrees of wickedne&s;s. Now it is expre&s;sly affirmed that the la&s;t &s;tate of that man is WORSE than the fir&s;t.</Q> He then goes on to ob&s;erve that this is applied to the Jewi&s;h nation, who had been awakened and reformed by the preaching of John, &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 34, 35.</NOTE></P>
<P>It has been before ob&s;erved, that in arguing from this in&s;tance, Mr. M. has expre&s;sly contradicted what he had advanced in a former argu|ment. Since therefore he has introduced this at &s;uch an expence, it would be very wrong not to allow it its full weight. The reader will judge for him&s;elf, when he has attended to the following particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. I allow that the going out of the unclean &s;pirit intends external reformation of gro&s;s, open &s;ins; which took place in a con&s;iderable de|gree among the Jews, upon the appearance and preaching of John Bap|ti&s;t, and continued for &s;ome time. But,</P>
<P N="2">2. I think Mr. M. has mi&s;taken the meaning of the 'hou&s;e empty, &s;wept and garni&s;hed.' This does not intend external reformation, or any reformation at all: But denotes a habitation &s;uited and prepared for the reception of &s;uch a gue&s;t or inhabitant as is an evil &s;pirit; every thing being ready for his admittance, and &s;uited to invite him to dwell there, and give him all de&s;irable advantage. In one word, it denotes a heart not made better or le&s;s &s;inful in any degree, but fit and prepared for the entrance and abode of a devil, only in a different &s;hape; and that he might dwell there with greater power and advantage. This indeed re|pre&s;ents the &s;tate of an awakened, convinced &s;inner. The unclean de|vil which reigned in him in a &s;tate of ignorance, &s;ecurity and external vice, now enters him in another &s;hape, for which his heart is now pre|pared in a manner it was not before, and becomes &s;even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">old more wicked and vile, in the exerci&s;es of a &s;elf-righteous, proud &s;pirit, and in more direct and &s;tronger oppo&s;ition to Chri&s;t and the go&s;pel. Mr. M. has therefore led me to a pa&s;&s;age very much to my purpo&s;e, and di|rectly again&s;t him&s;elf.</P>
<P>This al&s;o repre&s;ents the &s;tate of the Jews when they were in &s;ome mea&s;ure awakened and externally reformed. They only for&s;ook one way of wickedne&s;s for another, which was much greater, and every way wor&s;e. They tru&s;ted in them&s;elves that they were righteous, and hated and rejected Je&s;us Chri&s;t. In&s;tead of the unclean devil in obedi|ence to whom they had wallowed in external filthine&s;s, a &s;elf-righ|teous,
<PB N="80" REF="011295_0044_0F869EF43B839C68">
proud, unbelieving devil entered them: and they became &s;even fold more wicked and the children of hell, than the publicans and open &s;inners, in their hatred of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and direct, and violent oppo&s;i|tion to him.</P>
<P N="3">3. By <HI>fir&s;t and la&s;t &s;tate</HI> are meant, not their reformed &s;tate, and ex|ternal wickedne&s;s afterwards returned to; but the &s;tate they were in, before the unclean &s;pirit went out, and the &s;tate in which, under the influence of &s;even wor&s;e devils, they hated the divine character; and rejected and oppo&s;ed Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by which they became wor&s;e, more guilty and vile than the unclean Sodomites, and the inhabitants of Tyre and Sidon, and were going on to a more dreadful damnation, not|with&s;tanding all their external reformations &amp; profe&s;&s;ions, in which they clean&s;ed only the out&s;ide, while the mo&s;t abominable wickedne&s;s reign|ed within, and were 'like whited &s;epulchres, which indeed appeared beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanne&s;s.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mat. XXIII. 27.</NOTE></P>
<P>Thus, the true import of this parable being attended to, it appears to be &s;o far from containing an argument in favor of what Mr. M. has e&s;pou&s;ed, that it is directly again&s;t him, and repre&s;ents the Jews, not|with&s;tanding all their awakenings and reformations, more than &s;even fold wor&s;e than they were before, while they hated the divine character clearly &s;et before them in the incarnate Son of God, and ob&s;tinately rejected and oppo&s;ed him.</P>
<P>But if this mo&s;t natural and plain &s;en&s;e of the words is given up, and the interpretation Mr. M. has given is admitted, they will afford no argument in his favor; for,</P>
<P N="4">4. According to him, the Jews became <HI>wor&s;e,</HI> more guilty and vile, becau&s;e under all their awakenings, reformations, light and advantages, they did not embrace the go&s;pel; <Q>but hardened their hearts, and re|jected the cleare&s;t light and evidence of the truth, and thereby ripen|ed them&s;elves for a more aggravated condemnation.</Q> It was then the abu&s;e of the light and advantages they had, in their awakened, re|formed &s;tate, that ripened them for a more aggravated condemnation, which is the very thing which I a&s;&s;ert, and which Mr. M. oppo&s;es. And if it is allowed, that they, <Q>finally hardened their hearts, and re|jected the cleare&s;t light and evidence of the truth; and thereby ri|pened them&s;elves for a more aggravated condemnation,</Q> not in their awakened, reformed &s;tate, under the preaching of John Bapti&s;t, Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles: but, as Mr. M. &s;uppo&s;es, <HI>after</HI> all this, by returning to their former or greater external wickedne&s;s; this in&s;tance will be nothing to the ca&s;e before us: For tho' it be granted that if a per&s;on who has been under great awakenings and convictions, does not only abu&s;e all his light and conviction by continuing to reject Chri&s;t and the go&s;pel; but in oppo&s;ition to all this goes into an allowed cour&s;e of open wickedne&s;s, does hereby become more guilty and vile, and con|tracts greater hardne&s;s of heart, than while he was externally reformed under the influence of his convictions of con&s;cience; yet it does not follow that he was &s;o, when in a &s;tate of ignorance and &s;ecurity before
<PB N="81" REF="011295_0044_0F869EF43B839C68">
he had this light and conviction: In this ca&s;e the light and conviction he has had is the rea&s;on and ground of his greater &s;infulne&s;s; which &s;erves to &s;hew how &s;uch light and conviction aggravates all his &s;ins: and therefore that he could not have been &s;o guilty and vile, had he never been the &s;ubject of them: and &s;o is an argument in favor of what I have advanced: but if it was not, it is nothing again&s;t it; for it has no relation to the ca&s;e of a &s;inner before he falls under awakenings and conviction; but only to tho&s;e, who <HI>after</HI> awakenings and convictions fall into gro&s;s open wickedne&s;s; to which what I a&s;&s;ert has no re&s;pect at all. In a word, in order to prove that a &s;inner is more guilty and vile <HI>before</HI> he falls under awakenings and convictions, than he is when thus awakened, Mr. M. brings an in&s;tance to prove that he who runs into open wickedne&s;s <HI>after</HI> he has the&s;e convictions, is on this account more guilty and vile; which &s;urely is a very inconclu&s;ive way of arguing.</P>
<P>The next in&s;tance Mr. M. produces is that of "the young man, on who&s;e declaration of his having ob&s;erved the commandments from his youth, 'tis &s;aid, Chri&s;t beholding him, loved him."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mar. X. 21.</NOTE></P>
<P>Mr. M. ob&s;erves upon this, that "whatever di&s;pute may be rai&s;ed on the words," he &s;uppo&s;es it will be allowed by all, <Q>that he was a per|&s;on of an externally moral and amiable conver&s;ation, and that <HI>on that account</HI> Chri&s;t &s;hewed him re&s;pect, at lea&s;t as being le&s;s vile than if he had under his religious advantages continued in greater degrees of <HI>&s;tupidity,</HI> and lived in the open violation of all God's command|ments.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 35.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Here I take leave to ob&s;erve the following things.</P>
<P N="1">1. Mr. M. &s;eems here quite to have forgot what he was about, or had undertaken to do; which was to produce in&s;tances of "awakened, humbled, reformed &s;inners: for &s;urely he could not have the lea&s;t tho't that this young man was &s;uch an in&s;tance. He was not <HI>reformed;</HI> for had never been guilty of any cour&s;e of external &s;ins. He was not a <HI>humbled</HI> &s;inner; for he did not charge him&s;elf with the lea&s;t &s;in; and was &s;tupid and proud enough to think of obtaining eternal life by do|ing &s;ome good thing. It hence appears al&s;o that he had not the lea&s;t degree of true light and conviction of con&s;cience. Mr. M. &s;ays, "Chri&s;t &s;hewed him re&s;pect, as being le&s;s vile, than if he had continued in greater degrees of <HI>&s;tupidity.</HI> I wonder that he mentioned this; for he manife&s;ted the mo&s;t &s;hocking degree of <HI>&s;tupidity</HI> of con&s;cience, by &s;aying that he had kept all the commands, which Chri&s;t mentioned to him, from his youth. One would hope there was not another &s;uch ignorant, &s;tupid wretch among all the Jews.</P>
<P N="2">2. I do not allow, what Mr. M. &s;uppo&s;es will be allowed by all "that Chri&s;t &s;hewed him re&s;pect" and loved him, on the account of his good character, "at lea&s;t as being le&s;s vile, &amp;c."</P>
<P>If Chri&s;t loved him merely becau&s;e he was <HI>le&s;s vile</HI> than he might have been, he had the &s;ame rea&s;on to love every one that he &s;aw; for we have no rea&s;on to think that any one of them was as vile and &s;inful as he could po&s;&s;ibly be, on any &s;uppo&s;ition. Be&s;ides, this would be a very odd &s;ort of love indeed, which is wholly grounded on his being
<PB N="82" REF="011295_0045_0F869EF556573530">
le&s;s &s;inful and odious than he might have been, or than others were. It is indeed a <HI>love</HI> which con&s;i&s;ts in <HI>not hating him &s;o much,</HI> as if he had been more odious. In this &s;en&s;e we may be &s;aid to love all who are not &s;o bad as the devil, or the mo&s;t odious creatures in the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>Nor is there any rea&s;on to think that Chri&s;t loved him on account of any thing amiable and excellent in his character. His &s;aying "all the&s;e have I ob&s;erved from my youth," was much more of an expre&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t odious ignorance, &s;tupidity and wickedne&s;s of mind, than of any thing el&s;e.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. M. often &s;peaks of the phari&s;ee who went up to the temple to pray at "a proud, &s;tupid, &s;elf-ju&s;tifying &s;inner." And &s;ays, "he was, in &s;ome re&s;pects, if not on the whole the vile&s;t of all &s;inners."<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">P. 80, 81.</NOTE> I &s;ee not what great difference there is in the characters of the&s;e two. The young man was not an extortioner, unju&s;t or adulterer: and was doubt|le&s;s as exact in his ob&s;ervance of the fir&s;t table of the law, as of the &s;econd. And he certainly tru&s;ted in this as a righteou&s;ne&s;s to recom|mend him to God. He did not think that he wanted any thing more, unle&s;s it was to make further progre&s;s in his good deeds, and do &s;ome good thing, further to recommend him to God, which he had not yet done. Surely Mr. M. had no rea&s;on to &s;et one of the&s;e phari&s;ees in &s;o bad a light, as the greate&s;t &s;inner on earth; and repre&s;ent the other as a &s;mall &s;inner, and &s;o amiable as to attract Chri&s;t's re&s;pect and com|placency.</NOTE> He mu&s;t have been de&s;titute of all true benevolence, va&s;tly proud, and a perfect enemy to God, el&s;e he could not have been &s;o ignorant of him&s;elf, and the divine law: And Chri&s;t &s;aw all this in the cleare&s;t light. He "beholding him," looking on him as a poor, ignorant, &s;tupid, proud enemy to God, and in a mo&s;t wretched condi|tion, this excited in him the love of pity and benevolence towards him; and under the influence of this he went on to u&s;e means &s;uited to in&s;truct and relieve him. This, I &s;uppo&s;e is all that is meant by his <HI>loving</HI> him. We have no need to look for &s;omething amiable and ex|cellent in this young man, in order to account for Chri&s;t's loving him, with a love of pity and benevolence. Mi&s;ery and wretchedne&s;s, with|out any thing amiable, is the proper object of this love. Thus God is &s;aid to love the world of mankind, when they were his enemies,<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Joh. III. 16.</NOTE> and we are commanded to love our wor&s;t enemies, not with a love of com|placency, but of benevolence and kindne&s;s, how ever odious their cha|racter may ju&s;tly be to us. But if it were granted, that Chri&s;t loved him out of re&s;pect to his decent, amiable, external behaviour, (as &s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed) this is very con&s;i&s;tent with his being the greate&s;t &s;inner in the nation, his <HI>whole character</HI> being con&s;idered, as comprehending the &s;tate and exerci&s;es of his heart.&mdash;But more than enough has per|haps been &s;aid to &s;hew with what little rea&s;on Mr. M. has produced this in&s;tance in &s;upport of his cau&s;e.</P>
<P>HE goes on to &s;ay, <Q>Again, the &s;ame truth is clearly held forth by the apo&s;tle Peter, where he tells us, 'If after they have e&s;caped the
<PB N="83" REF="011295_0045_0F869EF556573530">
pollutions of the world, through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t, they are again entangled therein, and over|come; the latter end is wor&s;e with them than the beginning</Q> Upon this he a&s;ks the following que&s;tion, <Q>Is it not plainly implied in the&s;e words, that while <HI>he</HI> is not again entangled, and overcome with the pollutions of the world, i. e. continues to e&s;cape them, <HI>he</HI> is le&s;s vile?</Q> An&s;wer. If this is granted, it is nothing to the purpo&s;e: for according to this, there is reference only to their abu&s;e of that light and knowledge, which they had, <HI>after</HI> they had been awakened and reform|ed. The point in controver&s;y has no relation to &s;uch a ca&s;e as this. The que&s;tion between us is not, Whether a per&s;on that has reformed his external conduct under the influence of light and conviction of con|&s;cience, may not grow wor&s;e by returning to his former ways of &s;in|ning? But whether a convinced &s;inner, how much &s;oever he is reform|ed in his external conduct, is not on the whole wor&s;e, more guilty and vile than he was before he had this light and conviction? But this has been repeatedly ob&s;erved before. It &s;eems a little &s;trange and odd, that Mr. M. when he is hunting up arguments to &s;upport that &s;ide which he has taken of the que&s;tion in debate, &s;hould &s;o often quite forget the point in di&s;pute, and argue again&s;t &s;omething el&s;e.</P>
<P>But I have here to ob&s;erve Mr. M. has not given the true &s;en&s;e of the words. When St. Peter &s;ays, "the latter end is wor&s;e with them than the beginning," (or as the &s;ame words are rendered<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. XII. 45.</NOTE> the la&s;t &s;tate is wor&s;e with them, than the <HI>fir&s;t</HI>) he means, that they who have once, under the influence of their knowledge and conviction of the truths of chri&s;tianity, externally &s;ubmitted to the laws of that holy religion; and after that turn apo&s;tates, and fall into their former ways of external &s;in, are in a wor&s;e &s;tate, than they were before they had the knowledge of chri&s;tianity. Their <HI>beginning,</HI> or fir&s;t &s;tate, is the &s;tate they were in before they had e&s;caped the pollutions of the world, thro' the know|ledge of Chri&s;t. This is as evident as can be by the words immedi|ately following: "For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteou&s;ne&s;s, than after they had known it, to turn from the holy commandment." To prove that the <HI>latter end</HI> is <HI>wor&s;e</HI> with them than the beginning, he &s;ays it had been better for them, to have remained as they were in the beginning, i. e. in ignorance of the go&s;|pel, than to renounce it after they had known it Mr. M. has there|fore quite mi&s;taken the force and meaning of this text. As it &s;tands, it is rather a conformation of the point which he oppo&s;es: For their being in a wor&s;e &s;tate is wholly grounded, not in their greater external wickedne&s;s; for they are &s;uppo&s;ed only to return to their former ways in which they lived in the beginning: but on their returning to their old ways of &s;inning when they had &s;o much knowledge and conviction of the truth. So that their &s;inning again&s;t the <HI>internal</HI> light and con|viction which they had, is repre&s;ented as the chief aggravation of their &s;ins: which is the very thing which I a&s;&s;ert, and which Mr. M. oppo&s;es.</P>
<P>Mr. M. concludes his argument from the&s;e in&s;tances with the fol|lowing que&s;tion. <Q>Are not the&s;e as clear indications as can well be
<PB N="84" REF="011295_0046_0F869EF5B78662D0">
given by words, that the account the ble&s;&s;ed God makes of the&s;e different characters of men, under the means of grace is in favor of the negative part of the que&s;tion?</Q> I leave the reader now to an&s;wer this que&s;tion him&s;elf.</P>
<P>MR. M. proceeds, <Q>On the other hand to inquire, of what account with the ble&s;&s;ed God the character of the &s;ecure, bold, pre&s;umptu|ous, hardened &s;inner is, who ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ts in vicious and im|moral practices.</Q> This he propo&s;es to do by con&s;idering the threat|enings uttered by God again&s;t &s;uch in particular. And "the execution of his judgments and wrath, in the way of his providence, corre&s;pon|dent with the threatenings of his word," on tho&s;e of this character, when this is expre&s;sly a&s;&s;igned as the ground of the&s;e judgments.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 36.&mdash;40.</NOTE></P>
<P>The threatenings he mentions are contained in the &s;criptures referred to in the margin.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prov. XXIX. 1. Numb. XV. 30. Amos VI. 1. 1 The&s;&s;. V. 3. P&s;al.

<P>Upon this I &s;hall only make the following brief remarks.</P>
<P N="1">1. Mr. M. &s;uppo&s;e and allows that the&s;e are only threats and exe|cutions of "outward judgments," i. e. of temporal evils and calamities. And is it not ea&s;y to &s;ee why open, vi&s;ible &s;ins &s;hould be puni&s;hed vi&s;ibly and openly in this &s;tate, rather than tho&s;e which are invi&s;ible and &s;ecret: and therefore why tho&s;e &s;ins &s;hould be <HI>threatened</HI> with the&s;e judgments? It cannot be hence inferred, that the&s;e are always mo&s;t guilty and the greate&s;t &s;inners in God's &s;ight. God has no where in his word intimated that in his providence he treats men according to their true character, inflicting the greate&s;t outward judgments on the greate&s;t &s;inners, and &s;hewing the greate&s;t favors to the lea&s;t guilty and vile: So far from this, that directly the contrary is abundantly reveal|ed. Therefore nothing can be determined about the que&s;tion in di&s;|pute, who is on the whole the greate&s;t &s;inner, by all the threatenings and executions of God's judgments in this world.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">It cannot be inferred that the man of God who was &s;ent to cry again&s;t the altar at Bethel was a greater &s;inner than Jeroboam or the old prophet, becau&s;e he was &s;o &s;everely threatened, and &s;lain by a lion, while they were &s;pared.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">1 King. XIII.</NOTE> But this inferrence is as well grounded as Mr. M's. Nor is it any evidence that the man who refu&s;ed to &s;mite the prophet, was in this a greater criminal than any of his neighbours, becau&s;e he was for this act of di&s;obedience to the prophet threatened, and &s;lain by a Lion.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">1 King. XX. 35, 36.</NOTE></NOTE> Our Saviour ex|pre&s;sly oppo&s;es &amp; cen&s;ures &s;uch a conclu&s;ion as Mr. M. makes from the&s;e in&s;tances, in the followings words: (Suppo&s;e ye that the&s;e Galileans were &s;inners above all the Galileans, becau&s;e they &s;uffered &s;uch things? I tell you, Nay." God's bringing outward temporal calamities on &s;ome for their vi&s;ible open &s;ins, as a manife&s;tation of his di&s;plea&s;ure and an|ger,
<PB N="85" REF="011295_0046_0F869EF5B78662D0">
is no evidence that their external wickedne&s;s is greater, and more provoking to God, than the outward wickedne&s;s of many others, whom the &s;pares and &s;miles on in his providence; much le&s;s is it any evidence that they are in all re&s;pects, and on the whole, greater &s;inners than o|thers who e&s;cape the&s;e judgments.</P>
<P>It is enough that they, on whom the&s;e judgments are brought, de|&s;erve them, and infinitely more, and that it is wife and proper, all things con&s;idered, for God in this way to manife&s;t his di&s;plea&s;ure at them, tho' at the &s;ame time others who e&s;cape the&s;e judgments, are more guilty and vile in God's fight; and will have a much more in|tollerable condemnation in the day of judgment. Of this we have an in&s;tance which cannot be di&s;puted, in the inhabitants of Sodom, and tho&s;e of Capernaum, &amp;c. The former were burnt up in fire and brim|&s;tone from heaven; the latter, the mo&s;t of them, at lea&s;t, we have all rea&s;on to think died a natural death, with no extraordinary marks of the divine vengeance: And yet the latter were more guilty and vile than the former, our Saviour being judge, and will appear &s;o at the day of judgment. It might be al&s;o ob&s;erved that mo&s;t who had an actual hand in crucifying the Lord of glory, died quietly in their beds; and a peculiar vengeance fell on tho&s;e, who came upon the &s;tage after this; for the evils that come on the nation of the Jews, were &s;u&s;pend|ed till 40 years after this fact; in which time mo&s;t of that generation, died off, and others ro&s;e up in their room. And I &s;uppo&s;e all will al|low that the former were more guilty than the latter.</P>
<P N="2">2. Some of the threats Mr. M. has here quoted have no particular reference to external &s;ins of the unawakened &s;ecure &s;inner, or to any temporal, outward judgments; but are as applicable to the awakened, convinced &s;inner as to any other, and much more &s;o. "He that being often reproved, herdeneth his neck, &s;hall &s;uddenly be de&s;troyed, and that without remedy," is peculiarly applicable to an awakened, con|vinced &s;inner. Such an one is <HI>reproved</HI> by the light and convictions of his con&s;cience much more and oftener than any other: and he <HI>harden|eth his neck,</HI> more than others in proportion as his reproofs are &s;tronger and more con&s;tant. And his continuing to harden his neck will i&s;&s;ue in &s;udden and remedile&s;s de&s;truction.&mdash;And when it is &s;aid, "God &s;hall wound the head of his enemies: and the hairy &s;calp of &s;uch an one as goeth on &s;till in his tre&s;|pa&s;&s;es;" a &s;ecure profligate is no more pointed out, than an awakened, convinced &s;inner; for the latter is really as much an enemy to God, as the former, and "goeth on &s;till in his tre&s;pa&s;&s;es." Mr. M. might as well have quoted any other text in the bible as the&s;e. And his mentioning the&s;e, only &s;hews that he either little tho't what he was about, or quite mi&s;under&s;tood the character of the awa|kened, convinced &s;inner while unregenerate. The latter is doubtle&s;s the truth, &s;ince he appears to carry this mi&s;take thro' the whole of his book, and builds all his oppo&s;ition to me upon it, as has been before ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>But be this as it may, whether the texts Mr. M. has quoted are all to his purpo&s;e, or not; let it be remembered that however many threats of outward judgments for open wickedne&s;s there are in the bible; and
<PB N="86" REF="011295_0047_0F869EF9F4F261E0">
tho' there are many in&s;tances of God's bringing judgments on men for &s;uch &s;ins; yet this affords not the lea&s;t argument, that the&s;e were, all things con&s;idered, and on the whole, greater &s;inners than any others who have e&s;caped the&s;e judgments, nor is any &s;uch thing implied or intimated in all this, as has been &s;hewed in the fir&s;t remark. This ar|gument therefore of Mr. M's comes to nothing, and may well be num|bered with all the re&s;t, which have been con&s;idered.</P>
<P>AND now the reader is to judge of the weight of all Mr. M. has &s;aid in oppo&s;ition to the point in debate, and whether he has overthrown, or &s;o much as &s;haken, what I have advanced in my &s;ection on means; and have endeavoured to vindicate in the preceeding pages.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>IN which what Mr. M. has &s;aid upon &s;everal other pa&s;|&s;ages in my enquiry, is examined.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFTER Mr. M. has fini&s;hed what he had to &s;ay upon the propo&s;i|tion he &s;et up to di&s;pute again&s;t, he has filled up above two thirds of his book upon another point of doctrine, which he owns I have nei|ther expre&s;sly affirmed nor denied. He does not however, quite forget the former di&s;pute, but often brings it into view under this head, and &s;eems to think him&s;elf di&s;puting again&s;t me. What I am more e&s;peci|ally concerned with here is what he &s;ays under his <HI>fifth</HI> general head, in which he propo&s;es <Q>to touch briefly on &s;ome particular pa&s;&s;ages, which to him appear liable to exception, as not being clear from the holy &s;criptures.</Q></P>
<P>THE fir&s;t he mentions of this &s;ort, is my con&s;truction of tho&s;e words of Chri&s;t, "Strive to enter in at the &s;trait gate." I had &s;aid that &s;ome by the &s;trait gate here, under&s;tand "the entrance into heaven, or eternal life." And &s;triving to enter in at this gate mu&s;t then intend, <Q>a keep|ing the commandments of God, or the holy exerci&s;es of true &s;aints, by which they walk in the way to heaven; fight the good fight of faith, and &s;o lay hold on eternal life.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Enquiry, P. 1, 2.</NOTE></Q> And proceeded to offer &s;ome things in favour of this interpretation, without expre&s;sly declaring my own opinion. Mr. M. has taken an alarm at this, as if all ortho|doxy, and even religion it&s;elf was given up by &s;uch an interpretation of the&s;e words. But let us con&s;ider what he has to &s;ay again&s;t it.</P>
<P>He fir&s;t &s;ays, this is the <HI>Arminians</HI> &s;en&s;e of this text, <Q>which &s;ome think is a &s;hort &s;ummary of their whole &s;cheme. For this tends to deliver them from the invi&s;ible influences of the holy Spirit in grown per&s;ons, and &s;en&s;ible experiences and exerci&s;es in conver&s;ion, &amp;c.</Q> And he goes on to a&s;k, <Q>Is not advancing this glo&s;s on the text, the mo&s;t effectual method that could be taken unob&s;ervedly to overthrow Calvini&s;m in this point, and promote Arminiani&s;m?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="011295_0047_0F869EF9F4F261E0">
ANSWER. I am &s;orry if Calvini&s;m, or any one peculiar doctrine of it, depends &s;o much upon the meaning of this &s;ingle text, that it mu&s;t &s;tand or fall, according as this is under&s;tood. I think &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;iti|on is more favorable to Arminiani&s;m, than any interpretation that can be put upon this text. Calvini&s;ts are poorly off indeed, if they have no text but this to prove "the invincible influences of the holy Spirit, and &s;en&s;ible experiences and exerci&s;es in conver&s;ion;" which does indeed &s;ay nothing about them. Many Calvini&s;ts have greatly hurt them&s;elves and their cau&s;e, by pre&s;&s;ing into their &s;ervice texts of &s;cripture which have no relation to the point which they would &s;upport by them. And they need not be afraid of joining with Arminians, when they are &s;o lucky as to give the right &s;en&s;e of a text. And they who think the &s;en&s;e of this text which I have mentioned "is a &s;hort &s;ummary of the whole Arminian &s;cheme," or tends to &s;upport it in one article, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, I imagine, quite confu&s;ed and in the dark with re&s;pect to any &s;cheme of doctrines whatever.</P>
<P>Mr. M. goes on to &s;ay, <Q>However, as this interpretation of the text made by Arminians, was to me ob&s;cure and unintelligible, as not holding forth the true &s;en&s;e of the text; &s;o it equally is now, when made by a Calvini&s;t. But whether this is owing to the mi&s;interpre|tation of the text, or to my age and dullne&s;s, I &s;hall not determine, but leave to the impartial public, when the following things are con&s;idered<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 45, 46.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Let us then <HI>con&s;ider</HI> what he has &s;aid.</P>
<P>He ob&s;erves that I <Q>explain the &s;trait gate as meaning the entrance into heaven or eternal life;</Q> and &s;ays <Q>If I mean entering into hea|ven &s;trictly without a metaphor, this is not till death; and then it &s;hould &s;eem that <HI>&s;triving</HI> to enter in by this gate would be endea|vouring to die, which makes a very uncouth &s;en&s;e.</Q> <HI>Uncouth</HI> indeed! But we mu&s;t thank him for this &s;en&s;e: for I believe no mortal el&s;e would ever have thought of it. I &s;hould have thought that on my in|terpretation, &s;triving to enter this gate, was &s;triving to obtain eternal life, in going in the way that leads to it, the way of holine&s;s; or to be of that character, which alone will be admitted into heaven: or that it was to fight the good fight of faith, &s;o as to lay hold on eternal life. This is the &s;en&s;e I had given of &s;triving. He therefore proceeds to &s;ay <Q>But taking <HI>&s;triving</HI> as he has explained it, yet it is &s;till unintelligi|ble, how they can walk in the narrow way that leads to heaven, &s;ince they are &s;uppo&s;ed by his expo&s;ition, to have entered there by pa&s;&s;ing thro' the gate.</Q> I leave the reader to make the be&s;t he can of this.</P>
<P>He fir&s;t &s;ays that according to my interpretation, &s;triving to enter in at the &s;trait gate, means &s;triving to die. In the next &s;entence he &s;ays my expo&s;ition &s;uppo&s;es they who &s;trive to enter in at the &s;trait gate, have entered into heaven already; and he cannot &s;ee how, after this, they can be &s;aid to walk the narrow way that leads to heaven. He then a&s;ks "If by the entrance into heaven, I mean the entering into a &s;tate of grace, or conver&s;ion, how I have oppo&s;ed the &s;en&s;e of the text, which I endeavour to overthrow? But he pre&s;ently forgets all this, and
<PB N="88" REF="011295_0048_0F869EFA97FB9660">
&s;uppo&s;es that I make the gate and the way to mean one and the &s;ame thing: and that according to my con&s;truction, living a holy life and actually entering into heaven are the &s;ame.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 46, 47, 48.</NOTE> And upon the&s;e &s;uppo&s;i|tions, he argues again&s;t me, in his own imagination, very &s;trongly, till he thinks he has "re&s;tored the true and genuine &s;en&s;e of the text." But in the mid&s;t of all this he takes notice that I <Q>have not attempted to explain what is meant by the <HI>narrow way;</HI> nor &s;hewed the pro|priety of our Lord's placing <HI>this gate</HI> before <HI>the way</HI> in his repre&s;|entation; both which, I apprehend, (&s;ays he) nece&s;&s;ary to be done, in order to &s;et the &s;en&s;e of this important text in a true and con&s;i&s;|tent light.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> The words <HI>narrow way</HI> are not found in the text, nor is the gate placed before the way. And what need there was of <HI>explaining</HI> or &s;aying any thing about that which is not found in the text, I cannot conceive. I did indeed &s;ay, that &s;triving to enter in at the &s;trait gate according to the &s;en&s;e I mentioned, did intend walking in the way of holine&s;s; and this I &s;uppo&s;ed was the narrow way. Mr. M. repeated|ly tells of my &s;peaking of <HI>the way,</HI> and what my expo&s;ition makes it to mean: but he has ju&s;t at this in&s;tant forgot all this which was in his mind immediately before, and ju&s;t after, and &s;ays, "He has not at|tempted to explain what is meant by the <HI>narrow way!</HI>"</P>
<P>And now the reader is to determine whether all this is owing to Mr. M's <HI>age and dullne&s;s,</HI> or to &s;omething el&s;e, For my part, I cannot help <HI>determining</HI> that he was quite confu&s;ed and lo&s;t here, whatever was the cau&s;e of it; and that he has done nothing towards re&s;toring any &s;en&s;e of the text at all.</P>
<P>I OBSERVED that the word in the original tran&s;lated <HI>&s;trive,</HI> in the text, when u&s;ed in other places in the new-te&s;tament denoted not any exerci&s;es and doings before conver&s;ion, but the exertions and labours of true chri&s;tians in their way to heaven, which might <HI>perhaps</HI> be a good rea&s;on for under&s;tanding it in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e in this place. To &s;upport this ob&s;ervation I produced a number of in&s;tances. Three of the&s;e Mr. M. examines, and thinks they turn out rather again&s;t, than for me. The two fir&s;t are the words of St. Paul, &s;poken of him&s;elf, and of Ti|mothy. "I have fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ght the good fight. Fight the good fight of faith." Mr. M. ob&s;erves that <Q>in both the&s;e in&s;tances, that which limits the word <HI>fight</HI> or &s;trive to the exerci&s;es of true chri&s;tians, is rather the <HI>good</HI> fight, with which it is connected. Whereas if Mr. Hopkins's &s;en&s;e of the word &s;trive were certain, there had been no need at all for the apo&s;tle to have added, the <HI>good</HI> &s;trife or fight, &s;ince it could mean nothing el&s;e, but a good and holy &s;triving.</Q> It would have been a wild a&s;&s;ertion indeed if I had &s;aid, this word always nece&s;&s;arily carried this &s;en&s;e and could not &s;ignify any thing el&s;e. Words, I know are in them&s;elves quite arbitrary &s;igns, and no more &s;ignify one thing than another, till &s;ome meaning is affixed to them. All I attempted was to &s;hew in what &s;en&s;e the in&s;pired writers u&s;ed it, when applied to religious exerci&s;es. It was to Mr. M's purpo&s;e to &s;hew that they
<PB N="89" REF="011295_0048_0F869EFA97FB9660">
did not u&s;e it in the &s;en&s;e which I had &s;aid they did: but this he has not attempted.</P>
<P>I know, and particularly ob&s;erved, that the word was originally u&s;ed among the Greeks, to denote, the &s;trifes in the olympic and other pub|lic games. The apo&s;tle con&s;iders the&s;e &s;trifes as an emblem of the chri&s;tian race and &s;trife, in which men run and fight for eternal life; and therefore takes the word they u&s;ed for the former, and applies it to the latter. He calls the latter the <HI>good</HI> fight, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from that fight or agony which the word originally &s;ignified, and to which he has reference; and not to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the exerci&s;es and do|ings of the unregenerate, Mr. M. &s;ays, <Q>This &s;eems to imply there might be a fighting and &s;triving, that was not thus &s;trictly good and &s;ucce&s;sful.</Q> I grant that it implies there was a &s;triving in the olimpic games, in di&s;tinction from which the chri&s;tian's labor and &s;trife, is a <HI>good</HI> fight; but not that there was any other proper religious &s;triving di&s;tinct from this.</P>
<P>The other in&s;tance I mentioned, which Mr. M. excepts again&s;t, is in the following words, <Q>And every one that <HI>&s;triveth</HI> for the ma&s;tery, is temperate in all things: Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible.</Q> Upon this he &s;ays, <Q>Here the apo&s;tle &s;peaks of <HI>&s;triving</HI> for the ma&s;tery, and for a corruptible crown. Were the&s;e gracious exerci&s;es?</Q> Wonderful que&s;tion!</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> The&s;e exerci&s;es are an emblem of the gracious exerci&s;es of true chri&s;tians, in which they <HI>&s;trive</HI> for an incorruptible crown, which is here a&s;&s;erted of them. The reader &s;hall judge with how good a grace, and what propriety Mr. M. adds, <Q>This text which he has pro|duced, &s;eems to confute the interpretation he has advanced, in&s;tead of e&s;tabli&s;hing it.</Q> He who can think this a confutation of the inter|pretation I have advanced, can ea&s;ily confute every interpretation that ever was, or can be advanced on any text in the bible.</P>
<P>I quoted Dr. Doddridge, and Pool's Synop&s;is to prove that &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e that by the &s;trait gate is meant the entrance into heaven or eternal life. Mr. M. has been at &s;ome pains to &s;hew that no &s;uch in|terpretation of this text is found in the&s;e authors. In order to this he jumbles together part of what Dr. Doddridge &s;ays upon this and ano|ther text, taking part of a &s;entence from one, and joining it to a piece of a &s;entence on the other; carefully leaving out the words, which are apparently contrary to the &s;en&s;e he tries to make him &s;peak. The cri|tical reader who has Dr. Doddridge and Mr. M. before him, will, by examining and comparing, have a more clear and &s;triking idea of what Mr. Mr. has done in this matter, than can be given any other way. And I am confident he will be convinced that my reference to the Dr. was on good grounds; e&s;pecially if he ob&s;erves, that in his note on this text, in order to &s;hew the &s;en&s;e of the original word, here tran&s;lated <HI>&s;trive,</HI> he refers to tho&s;e texts which have been mentioned,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. IX. 25. Col. I. 29. 1 Tim. VI. 12. 2 Tim. IV. 7.</NOTE> in which the exerci&s;es of chri&s;tian faith and holine&s;s are &s;poken of.</P>
<P>Mr. M. &s;ays, 'Such is my weakne&s;s, that I cannot devi&s;e why this
<PB N="90" REF="011295_0049_0F869EFAFA251220">
author referred to Dr. Doddridge, as an authority for his <HI>new &s;en&s;e</HI> of this text. On this I would ob&s;erve the following things.</P>
<P>I did not refer to the doctor <HI>as an authority</HI> for this &s;en&s;e of the text. I hope I never &s;hall be guilty of referring to any unin&s;pired <HI>man</HI> as an <HI>author<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"></HI> When I mentioned a &s;en&s;e which <HI>others</HI> put upon this text, I referred to the doctor as one of them, not as any evidence that this was right &s;en&s;e: but that it was in fact &s;o under&s;tood by &s;ome, as I a&s;&s;erted.</P>
<P>Why does Mr. M. here call this a <HI>new &s;en&s;e</HI> of this text, when he had &s;o often &s;aid it was a &s;en&s;e, which arminians put upon it; unle&s;s it be that he may add to the number of his many &s;elf contradictions!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Be&s;ides, it appears that this was Mr. M's &s;en&s;e of the text, above 20 years ago. So that he has by calling it a <HI>new &s;en&s;e</HI> now, contradict|ed him&s;elf in another &s;en&s;e, and yet higher degree. In his letter to Dr. John&s;on, called a <HI>A vindication of go&s;pel truth,</HI> he &s;ays<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 17.</NOTE> <Q>The &s;crip|ture no where puts mankind upon &s;eeking their everla&s;ting happine&s;s in any other way than that of <HI>well doing,</HI> truly &s;uch <HI>in the account of God,</HI> i. e. <HI>doing his commandments.</HI></Q> Certainly then when Chri&s;t <Q>puts mankind upon &s;eeking their eternal happine&s;s,</Q> by telling them to &s;trive to enter in at the &s;trait gate, he means <HI>doing the commandments of God,</HI> as I have explained it.</NOTE> Per|haps however, he means to &s;et NEW, in oppo&s;ition to orthodox. If &s;o, this will account for his calling every thing he does not approve <HI>new divinity.</HI></P>
<P>How far Mr. M's <HI>weakne&s;s</HI> appears in this, or in any thing el&s;e to be found in his book, is a matter of no great importance, and is left en|tirely to the judgment of the reader. All that I am concerned to make out is, the <HI>weakne&s;s</HI> of what he &s;ays in &s;upport of the cau&s;e he has e&s;|pou&s;ed.</P>
<P>He al&s;o endeavours to &s;hew that I have made a mi&s;take in refering to <HI>Pool's Synop&s;is</HI> for this &s;en&s;e of the text.</P>
<P>As this is a matter of no great importance, I will not trouble the reader with the defence of my&s;elf, which I think I am able to make, and a particular confutation of what Mr. M. has &s;aid; but I leave it entirely with the learned, who will be at the pains of con&s;ulting the <HI>&s;ynop&s;is.</HI> However, I will ju&s;t mention three mi&s;taks which Mr. M. has made, in what he has &s;aid on this head.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> He takes whatever he finds in the &s;ynop&s;is to be Mr. Pool's, as his opinion, and what he a&s;&s;erts; whereas Mr. Pool was only the col|lector and tran&s;criber of what former expo&s;itors had wrote. Therefore he produces the different and oppo&s;ite &s;entiments of expo&s;itors and con|&s;tantly refers to them in the margin. Mr. M's quotation in the margin is what Mr. Pool collected from two expo&s;itors, the latter of which has been reckoned in &s;ome &s;en&s;e the father of all Arminians. Mr. M. pre|tends to give a tran&s;lation, or paraphra&s;e of it, (tho' I think it is nei|ther) and repre&s;ents it as what Mr. Pool a&s;&s;erts. Mr. Pool never tho't him&s;elf an&s;werable for all the opinions of expo&s;itors he quotes in his <HI>&s;ynop&s;is.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="011295_0049_0F869EFAFA251220"><HI>Secondly.</HI> Mr. M. here again &s;uppo&s;es I quote Pool's &s;ynop&s;is as an authority to &s;upport that &s;en&s;e of the text which I had mentioned. Whereas I referred to this only to &s;upport my a&s;&s;ertion, that this &s;en&s;e has been put on the text; and not as the lea&s;t evidence that it was the right one, as I have before ob&s;erved. However, while Mr. M. runs into this mi&s;take and that ju&s;t mentioned, he is right, in rejecting all human authority in the following words, <Q>But &s;uppo&s;e Mr. Pool was of opinion, &amp;c. as we are <HI>to call no man father on earth,</HI> I would enquire, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> Mr. M. here &s;uppo&s;es that whatever the unregenerate are di|rected or commanded to do, they are to do, or may do it, while unrege|nerate; and &s;o that they are directions or commands to unregenerate do|ings. This is manife&s;t in what he pretends to take from <HI>Pool's Synop&s;is,</HI> ju&s;t mentioned, in the following words, <Q>Chri&s;t invites or requires all, the unregenerate not excepted, to take in hand, or enter upon the way of holine&s;s. And that they &s;trive in this matter with all their powers.</Q> Tho' all the unregenerate are required immediately to enter upon the way of holine&s;s, and to &s;trive in this matter, &amp;c. this does not certainly enjoin unregenerate &s;trivings, unle&s;s whatever the unregenerate are com|manded to do, they are to do as &s;uch, or while unregenerate. But what Mr. M. here &s;uppo&s;es is by no means true. The unregenerate are com|manded to love God, and to &s;trive in this matter, and exert all their pow|ers. But it does not follow from this that unregenerate men do thus love God, or ever will while unregenerate. But this matter will be more particularly con&s;idered in another &s;ection.&mdash;I return to the text under con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>IT was my prevailing opinion, when I wrote my enquiry that the <HI>&s;trait gate</HI> in this text does not mean the entrance on a religious life, or conver|&s;ion from &s;in to God; but the entrance into eternal life, to which a life of holine&s;s or the good fight of faith is the way; and therefore is the &s;triv|ing here commanded, which includes the beginning in the fir&s;t act of faith and repentance, &amp;c. as well as progre&s;s in this way unto the end of life. And I have not been lead to alter my opinion, by any thing that Mr. M. has &s;aid, or that I have learned from any other quarter. Some|thing I then &s;aid in &s;upport of the interpretation in que&s;tion. And I mu&s;t now a&s;k the patience of the reader, while I mention &s;everal other things which appear to me to be in favour of this &s;en&s;e of the text.</P>
<P N="1">1. The words immediately following the&s;e &s;eem to be in favor of this con&s;truction.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">V. 25&mdash;30.</NOTE> 'When once the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e is ri&s;en up, and hath &s;hut to the door, and ye begin to &s;tand without, and to knock at the door, &s;aying, Lord, Lord, open unto us, &amp;c.&mdash;There &s;hall be weeping, &amp;c. when ye &s;hall &s;ee Abraham, and I&s;aac, and Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, &amp;c." The&s;e words are evidently introduced with reference to what is &s;aid in the text, and to explain and enforce it. And we are hereby led to under&s;tand this &s;ame thing by the <HI>&s;trait gate</HI> in the text, and the <HI>door</HI> in the next &s;entence. The way to eternal life, or the kingdom of God, the gate or door by which per&s;ons enter thither, and by which the patriarchs and prophets have gone into this kingdom, now

&s;tands open to all; and all are invited to enter in: and all that is ne&s;|&s;ary in order to this, is to <HI>&s;trive</HI> to enter in, or to go in the way which leads to eternal life. And all are urged <HI>now</HI> &s;o to run for eternal life, not as uncertainly; &s;o to &s;trive and fight the good fight of faith, as to lay hold on eternal life, from this awakening con&s;ideration, that many &s;hall <HI>&s;eek</HI> to enter in, &s;hall cry for admittance when it is too late, and the door is forever &s;hut. From this view of the matter, I think it is very evident, that the <HI>&s;eeking</HI> to enter in, which is di&s;tingui&s;hed from <HI>&s;triving,</HI> and is &s;et in oppo&s;ition to it, intends the crying for admittance in at the door, after it is &s;hut, repre&s;ented in the words immediately following. And if &s;o, it will follow, that the &s;trait gate, and the door mean the &s;ame thing: For Chri&s;t &s;ays, many <HI>&s;hall</HI> &s;eek to enter in, i. e. at the &s;trait gate; and <HI>&s;hall not</HI> be able, and then goes on to illu&s;trate this, by telling how they &s;hall knock and cry for admittance at this gate or door, after it is &s;hut. And is it not equally evident, that by <HI>&s;triving</HI> Chri&s;t means that which &s;hall be effectual, and &s;hall certainly bring a per&s;on to "enter in through the gates into heaven," &s;ince it is put in oppo&s;ition to that which &s;hall be ineffectual, and is con&s;i&s;tent with being forever excluded? Thus I think, if we attend to Chri&s;t's own explanation of the&s;e words, I think we cannot be at a lo&s;s about their meaning.</P>
<P N="2">2. The pa&s;&s;age ju&s;t now alluded to,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rev. XXII. 14.</NOTE> &s;eems to be in &s;ome mea&s;ure parellel to this under con&s;ideration, 'Ble&s;&s;ed are they that do his com|mandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the <HI>gates</HI> into the holy city." Here is a gate, or gates mentioned, as the entrance into heaven, and the way to enter is to <HI>do his commandments.</HI> This therefore <HI>&s;triving</HI> to enter in at the&s;e gates. They therefore who do &s;trive to enter in at this gate, do ob&s;erve the commandment of Chri&s;t, and &s;hall certainly be &s;ucce&s;sfull. If &s;triving is Chri&s;t's command, they who &s;trive, do his commandment, and &s;o &s;hall enter into eternal life, thro' the gate. This leads me to ob&s;erve further.</P>
<P N="3">3. It &s;eems to me very di&s;honorable to Chri&s;t, and contrary to his wi&s;dom, faithfulne&s;s and goodne&s;s, to &s;uppo&s;e that he has given any direction and command to &s;inners, in order to their &s;alvation, which they may punctually ob&s;erve and do, and yet mi&s;s of &s;alvation. If they may do &s;o; what &s;afety is there in relying upon his advice and direc|tion: for according to this, he does not always advi&s;e and direct to the way that leads to heaven; but to that which a man may follow, and yet be going in the way to hell. Chri&s;t &s;ays, 'Ble&s;&s;ed is the man that heareth me.'<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. VIII. 24.</NOTE> He that &s;trives to enter in at the &s;trate gate, heareth Chri&s;t; for this is his coun&s;el and advice to men; and therefore is &s;afe and ble&s;&s;ed. It is implied in the&s;e words, that he who &s;triveth &s;hall be able to enter in, or &s;hall certainly enter in, in di&s;tinction from tho&s;e who &s;hall &s;eek to enter in, and &s;hall not be able. And who can now think, that men may faithfully and punctually take the advice, and follow the command of him who came to teach men the way to life, and yet not be able to enter in, but peri&s;h at la&s;t?</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="011295_0050_0F869EFBCE9EEF68">In this view, they who take the &s;triving here commanded, to be the doings of the unregenerate, and at the &s;ame time hold that there are promi&s;es made to &s;uch &s;trivings, are more con&s;i&s;tent; and in this re&s;pect, do not, I think, reflect &s;o much di&s;honor on Chri&s;t, as they who hold the former and deny the latter. And hence it is, perhaps; that it is &s;o common for the latter to contradict them&s;elves, and <HI>impli|citly</HI> hold that there are promi&s;es to the doings of the unregenerate, or which amounts to the &s;ame thing, while they are <HI>expre&s;sly</HI> denying it.</P>
<P>Mr. M. is an in&s;tance of this, not the lea&s;t remarkable; for, as has been ob&s;erved, he in the book under con&s;ideration, applies &s;criptures to the unregenerate, which carry a promi&s;e in them to tho&s;e who com|ply with the direction and command. And when he had formerly wrote a book to prove there are no promi&s;es to the doings of the un|regenerate, he concludes the whole with the following declaration, <Q>On the whole, I would ju&s;t make this one remark, <HI>and be it remembered:</HI> though I deny any <HI>promi&s;e,</HI> by virtue of which the <HI>&s;pecial grace</HI> of God can po&s;&s;ibly become <HI>due</HI> to the prayers and endeavours of the unre|generate, while &s;uch; yet, however, <HI>I am per&s;uaded,</HI> that it is the duty of &s;inners to be &s;eeking and &s;triving after it; and that <HI>not a &s;ingle in&s;tance</HI> will be found of any &s;inner in the day of judgment, able to &s;tand forth, and plead in truth, Lord, I did my be&s;t endeavour to the very la&s;t, that I might obtain the &s;alvation which is by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and looked diligently le&s;t I &s;hould fail of the grace of God; but after all, was deny'd.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vindi. of Go&s;. Truth. P. 76, 77.</NOTE></Q> How did Mr. M. come to be thus <HI>per&s;uaded,</HI> unle&s;s it was from the nature and perfections of God? But if the&s;e, or any thing el&s;e, are the proper ground of &s;uch a <HI>per&s;ua&s;ion,</HI> then they are as good a &s;ecurity to the &s;inner as ten thou&s;and promi&s;es would be. And on the &s;ame ground we may be <HI>per&s;uaded</HI> that he who &s;trives to enter in at the &s;trait gate, according to the advice of our kind Saviour, &s;hall not mi&s;s of &s;alvation, as this may be argued from the character &amp; perfec|tion of Chri&s;t, whether he has made any expre&s;s promi&s;e or not. And now, by the way, we may &s;ee the force of the following words, of Mr. M. when &s;peaking of this performance, he &s;ays,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pref. P. 4.</NOTE> <Q>Which, according to my <HI>weak</HI> ability, was attempted in &s;uch a manner as might guard again&s;t this its oppo&s;ite extreme, by leaving proper, &s;criptural encou|ragement to a diligent attendance on means.</Q> I &s;ee not how there can be any thing worth di&s;puting about between tho&s;e who hold that there are promi&s;es made to the doings of the unregenerate, &amp; tho&s;e who hold to <HI>this</HI> encouragement. And it is worthy of particular remark here, that in the&s;e words he gives the unregenerate &s;inner a character, which never yet belonged to &s;uch, and &s;ets him in a light, in which he is rather to be pitied than blamed, doing his <HI>be&s;t endeavour</HI> to the <HI>very la&s;t,</HI> and <HI>looking diligently</HI> le&s;t he &s;hould fail of the grace of God. He that does <HI>his be&s;t,</HI> does un&s;peakably more than ever an unregenerate man did, or any other meer man in this world; for he is perfectly in|nocent and holy. And he who diligently &s;eeks, <HI>&s;hall find.</HI> He has a divine promi&s;e to rely upon, which is much better, than Mr. M's <HI>per|&s;ua&s;ion.</HI> He who has &s;o good an opinion of the unregenerate, can never

con&s;i&s;tently think they &s;hall fail of &s;alvation, upon their thus doing their be&s;t, and has no rea&s;on to quarrel with him who a&s;&s;erts that there are promi&s;es to &s;uch.</P>
<P N="4">4. It appears to me that a per&s;on does never truly <HI>&s;trive</HI> for that, which he oppo&s;es with all his heart, and to obtain which nothing is wanting but the lea&s;t degree of inclination of heart towards it, and &s;in|cere de&s;ire of it. But this is true of unregenerate &s;inners, in the ca&s;e before us. They have not the lea&s;t inclination to enter the &s;trait gate, or to embrace the go&s;pel. Their want of this, and fixed oppo&s;ition of heart to it, is the only thing in the way of their entering, or that keeps them out. And to &s;uppo&s;e they do &s;trive to enter in at this gate, while they remain &s;o, is, I think, very ab&s;urd. They may &s;trive indeed, and have great motions and &s;trong exertions of mind, relating to their future &s;tate and eternal &s;alvation: But this will be &s;o far from &s;triving to enter in at this gate, that all their &s;triving, every exertion and voluntary ex|erci&s;e of their heart will be a refu&s;al to enter, and oppo&s;ition to it. Now who can think Chri&s;t exhorted to &s;uch exerci&s;es as the&s;e, under the notion of their being &s;trivings to enter in at the &s;trait gate? This is to u&s;e language quite otherwi&s;e, and in a manner directly oppo&s;ite to what mankind do in the common affairs of life.</P>
<P>This may be illu&s;trated thus; The &s;on of a certain and worthy fa|ther has &s;tolen a thou&s;and pounds from his father, and run off; and the father pur&s;ues and overtakes him, and kindly invites him to return home, and promi&s;es to forgive him, and to make him heir of all that he has, if he will turn about and re&s;olutely &s;ee his face homeward be|ing willing to <HI>&s;trive,</HI> to exert all his &s;trength in overcoming the difficul|ties of the way to his father's hou&s;e. But if he finds him ob&s;tinately &s;et in his way, and without the lea&s;t inclination to return, or &s;o much as to turn his face about, he will not exhort him to <HI>&s;trive</HI> to turn about, under the notion of his doing this, while his heart is wholly oppo&s;ite to it; becau&s;e this is a contradiction. And if he &s;hould &s;ay to him, "Strive to turn about and get into the road which leads home," it would be under&s;tood as an exhortation to exerci&s;e &s;ome inclination that way, at lea&s;t; and not that he &s;hould &s;trive for this, not only without any inclination to it, but in direct oppo&s;ition to his whole will. And if it was taken in the latter &s;en&s;e, it would be thought the mo&s;t ab&s;urd propo&s;al that ever was made. Surely he mu&s;t &s;trive without any heart or will, who &s;trives to do that which is in direct oppo&s;ition to his whole heart and will, and the doing of which is nothing but willing and choo&s;ing it. And this is a &s;trange &s;ort of &s;triving indeed! I am bold to &s;ay no man ever yet had an idea of it; becau&s;e it is in it&s;elf a mo&s;t perfect contradiction.&mdash;</P>
<P>For the&s;e rea&s;ons, and others that might be mentioned, I think this text is to be under&s;tood as it has been explained, and that by <HI>&s;triving</HI> here Chri&s;t does not mean any thing which impenitent unbelievers ever do, while &s;uch. Nor do I &s;ee any bad con&s;equences of under&s;tanding the text in this &s;en&s;e. Mr. M. ob&s;erves this is the Arminian &s;en&s;e of the text; &amp; contrary to that which Calvini&s;ts put upon it. And &s;ays, <Q>It &s;eems
<PB N="95" REF="011295_0051_0F869EFC76CE4DD0">
&s;omewhat &s;trange, that when this author undertook the cau&s;e of or|thodoxy, he &s;hould give up and reject their &s;en&s;e of the text, which was &s;o greatly in di&s;pute.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> It would &s;eem as &s;trange at lea&s;t, if every one who <HI>undertakes in the cau&s;e of orthodoxy,</HI> &s;hould be obliged to under&s;tand every text of &s;cripture exactly in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e in which it has been taken by tho&s;e who have been on the &s;ame &s;ide of the que&s;tion. This would be to renounce orthodoxy in many in&s;tances, I doubt not. And what point of <HI>orthodoxy</HI> is given up or the lea&s;t weakened by the &s;en&s;e I have given of the text, I cannot imagine. Whereas by e&s;pou&s;ing the &s;en&s;e which I am oppo&s;ing an important point of orthodoxy is, I think, implicitly given up (which indeed is given up by Mr. M. thro' his whole book;) viz. that unregenerate &s;inners do not with their whole hearts oppo&s;e Je&s;us Chri&s;t and the way of &s;alvation by him. In this view, an attempt to re&s;tore this text to the true &s;en&s;e, is to e&s;pou&s;e the cau&s;e of orthodoxy. And it does not fright me at all to be told that Arminians under&s;tand this text as I do. For who would not much rather join with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Arminians &s;o far as they are right, than with the mo&s;t orthodox Cal|vini&s;ts, wherein they are wrong?</P>
<P>Mr. M. a&s;ks, <Q>If this text does not re&s;pect the unconverted, and en|join duties upon them, where can there be any pa&s;&s;age found in the bible that has any reference to them?</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> If this is the only text in the bible that enjoins unregenerate duties and doings, I think the doctrine of duties enjoined on the unre|generate, to be done by them while &s;uch, which Mr. M. has &s;o zeal|ou&s;ly e&s;pou&s;ed, &s;tands on a very weak and precarious foundation&mdash;But it &s;eems Mr. M. is not in earne&s;t here: but only makes this out-cry, and a&s;ks this que&s;tion to an&s;wer a particular end: For before he has done, he thinks he finds &s;cripture enough be&s;ides this, which enjoins duties upon the unconverted, to be done by them while &s;uch,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 70.</NOTE> and &s;ays that "the&s;e performances of the &s;inner are encouraged by God thro'out the &s;criputres."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 82.</NOTE> But this will be more particularly con&s;idered hereafter.</P>
<P>Mr. M. as many others have, takes this text in Luke, to be parallel with that in Matthew,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. VII. 13, 14.</NOTE> "Enter ye in at the &s;trait gate; becau&s;e &s;trait is the gate, and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life."</P>
<P>There is perhaps no good rea&s;on for this. The former &s;ays nothing about the <HI>narrow way;</HI> but &s;peaks of a gate only, which, as has been ob&s;erved, is in the following words called the <HI>door</HI> which &s;hall be &s;hut, when this life is at an end. But if it is granted that the&s;e two texts are parallel, meaning the &s;ame thing, Mr. M. will gain nothing by it in favor of unregenerate &s;trivings and doings: for upon this &s;uppo&s;ition <HI>&s;triving</HI> to enter in, and actually entering in are the &s;ame thing. But to enter in at the &s;trait gate is certainly not any thing that unregenerate men do.</P>
<P>Mr. M. has indeed attempted to prove that &s;triving to enter the &s;trait gate intends, &s;omething previous to actual entrance: and his argument is &s;o remarkable, that I will tran&s;cribe every word of it. <Q>Strive to enter in at the &s;trait gate, i. e. &s;trive to enter upon the chri&s;tian life,
<PB N="96" REF="011295_0052_0F869F01D837FF38">
as explained above. And is not this attempt to enter, previous to actual entrance, &s;ince the former &s;ometimes exi&s;ts without the latter? For many I &s;ay unto you will &s;eek to enter in, and &s;hall not be able.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P. 70.</NOTE></Q> Here, in order to form his argument, he makes <HI>&s;triving</HI> to enter, and <HI>&s;eeking</HI> to enter to mean one and the &s;ame thing: for he proves the former is not connected with entering in, from Chri&s;t's declaring the latter is not. This makes the text to run thus, "Strive to enter in at the &s;trait gate; for verily I &s;ay unto you, this &s;triving &s;hall in many in&s;tances be to no purpo&s;e, and you may &s;trive as much as you will and yet never enter! This I believe is quite a <HI>new &s;en&s;e</HI> of the text, and is peculiar to Mr. M. and I hope and tru&s;t will remain &s;o.</P>
<P>But let us hear "the true and genuine &s;en&s;e of the text" from Mr. M. in the following words. <Q>Were I allowed to &s;peak freely my <HI>humble &s;en&s;e</HI> of the text, to me it appears, that by entering the &s;trait gate, is meant active conver&s;ion to God, or a compliance with the covenant of grace, in the way of faith, &amp;c.&mdash;This is the gate we mu&s;t enter upon pain of eternal damnation. What! And not required <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>&s;trive</HI> in this matter! Thrice amazing!<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">P. 48, 49.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>This is a violent di&s;charge or fervent zeal by way of ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">mation, as all will perceive: but the <HI>humble &s;en&s;e</HI> as well as the argument &s;eem to be quite lo&s;t by the means; at lea&s;t, are not &s;o ea&s;ily perceived. Since Mr. M. has had &s;o long a time to cool, calm down, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> at &s;uch a di&s;tance from him I will venture, to &s;ay, if entering the &s;trait gate means active conver&s;ion, in the way of faith, then &s;triving to enter is doing that by which men enter, or actually converting to God, and believing, or that which is done with a good will to this, which is the &s;ame. And all that &s;triving which is in oppo&s;ition to converting and believing, &amp;c. (as are all the &s;trivings of the unregenerate) is not &s;triv|ing to enter the &s;trait gate; but &s;triving to do &s;omething el&s;e; or ra|ther &s;triving in direct oppo&s;ition to it.</P>
<P>ANOTHER &s;entence which Mr. M. finds great fault with is in the following words, <Q>It has been ob&s;erved that the end of u&s;ing or atten|ding on the means of grace is in&s;truction.</Q> He thinks it is very wrong indeed, and of a bad tendency to &s;ay the end of the u&s;e of means is <HI>in&s;truction:</HI> And undertakes to &s;hew "that the end of attending on the means of grace, is grace, the fruits of holine&s;s."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 51, 52.</NOTE></P>
<P>In order to &s;ee how groundle&s;s Mr. M's objection is, and how very wrong and injurious is his repre&s;entation of this matter, nothing more is needful than to refer the reader to the whole pa&s;&s;age from which he takes the&s;e words:<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 121, &amp;c.</NOTE> Yea, all he &s;ays upon this is &s;ufficiently refuted in the paragraph from which he takes them, which is contained in le&s;s than ten lines.</P>
<P>Having taken notice in the words which Mr. M. quotes, that it had been ob&s;erved that the end of u&s;ing or attending on the means of grace is in&s;truction, I proceed to &s;ay, <Q>The que&s;tion now is, What end this in&s;truction an&s;wers; Of what advantage is it to have the truth &s;et before the mind, and to have the attention of the mind fixed upon it?</Q> From this it &s;ufficiently appears, had I not &s;aid another word,
<PB N="97" REF="011295_0052_0F869F01D837FF38">
that I did not con&s;ider in&s;truction or knowledge as the ultimate end of means; becau&s;e the very inquiry I am upon is, "What end this in|&s;truction an&s;wers?" But Mr. M. goes on and harangues away for a page or two, again&s;t my making in&s;truction the ultimate end of means; in di&s;tinction from grace or holine&s;s and &s;alvation. If Mr. M. did not read the whole of this pa&s;&s;age, e&s;pecially the whole paragraph and even &s;entence from which he quotes, he is doubtle&s;s very much to blame: but if he did, it will be difficult to conceive how he could ignorantly make &s;uch a gro&s;s mi&s;take and very injurious mi&s;repre&s;entation. The fir&s;t and immediate end which is an&s;wered by the u&s;e of means is in|&s;truction, <Q>or, (as I further expre&s;s it) to lead the mind to the know|ledge of that truth, of which it was before ignorant, or to renew the attention to truth already known, and fix the mind upon it.</Q> And then I go on to tell what end <HI>this</HI> an&s;wers, and particularly &s;hew that it prepares the mind in which there is a right <HI>ta&s;te,</HI> or whenever it &s;hall be brought to this, to exerci&s;e holine&s;s. And then go on to &s;hew how important and nece&s;&s;ary it is that the unregenerate &s;hould be all atten|tion in the con&s;tant u&s;e of means, as the only way in which they may hope for &s;alvation. Mr. M. not only a&s;&s;erts from this, that I make the only end of the u&s;e of means to be in&s;truction; but goes on to men|tion &s;ome dangerous con&s;equences that will follow from it. But as they are con&s;equences of his own inventing, and are taken from what I never a&s;&s;erted, and in direct contradiction to what I &s;ay, I &s;hall not further trouble my&s;elf, or the reader with them.</P>
<P>BUT Mr. M. goes on, I think, from bad to wor&s;e, and &s;uffers his imagination, or &s;omething el&s;e, to run quite away with him; for he proceeds to remark on another exceptionable pa&s;&s;age of mine, which is in the following words. <Q>If it &s;hould be a&s;ked, What good all this in|&s;truction and knowledge will do the unregenerate, who are under the dominion of an hard and impenitent heart, and will continue &s;o until a new heart is given in regeneration? If this knowledge will be of no &s;ervice to them, and really do them no good, and they are yet as far from &s;alvation as ever; then there is no encouragement for them to attend on the means of grace, in order to obtain it, and keep up a view and &s;en&s;e of the truths of chri&s;tianity in their minds.</Q></P>
<P>I having &s;hewn the nece&s;&s;ity of in&s;truction and knowledge, and the mind's attending to the truth, in order to the exerci&s;es of faith and re|pentance, &amp;c. In the&s;e words proceed to propo&s;e a query and objection, which I &s;uppo&s;ed would naturally ari&s;e in the mind of the reader; that by an&s;wering the&s;e I might more fully clear up this matter, and &s;hew what end in&s;truction an&s;wers, and the good this will do the unre|generate; and in what &s;en&s;e they who thus attend are not &s;o far from &s;alvation as others. And this I proceed to do, as an <HI>An&s;wer</HI> to this query and objection. Now Mr. M. takes this query and objection, which I introduce in order to an&s;wer, to be certain a&s;&s;ertations of my own, viz. that this in&s;truction and knowledge will <HI>in fact</HI> do no good, is of no &s;ervice to the unregenerate; and leaves them as far from &s;alvation as ever. And upon &s;uch a gro&s;s mi&s;take and mi&s;repre&s;entation, he ha|rangues
<PB N="98" REF="011295_0053_0F869F01E41DCDC8">
away for near &s;even pages. And what is not the lea&s;t remarka|ble here is, that he makes u&s;e of what I had &s;aid in an&s;wer to this objection, and to &s;hew that the &s;uppo&s;itions made in it are not true, to confute me, and to prove the &s;ame thing, as he imagined, again&s;t me: I &s;ay, <HI>as he imagined,</HI> but it requires a great &s;tretch of charity, I confe&s;s, to &s;uppo&s;e him in earne&s;t here; and not rather trying how much he could mi&s;repre&s;ent me, and impo&s;e on his reader. But here we mu&s;t call in for our a&s;&s;i&s;tance his <HI>old age, dullne&s;s and weakne&s;s,</HI> of which he &s;o often reminds the reader.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to this query and objection, I endeavour to &s;hew what is not the end which is an&s;wered by the &s;inner's attendance on means, while impenitent; and what good the in&s;truction and knowledge he gets does <HI>not</HI> do, while he oppo&s;es, and lives in the abu&s;e of it.

<P>Mr. M. here repre&s;ents me as not including external reformation of open, gro&s;s &s;ins in what is preparatory to conver&s;ion, or &s;aying a word that implies it.

<P>In this a&s;&s;ertion he has contradicted him&s;elf, as he has repeatedly de|clared the contrary, and thro' his whole book &s;uppo&s;es that I am &s;peak|ing of the <HI>reformed &s;inner,</HI> and no other. Thus he &s;ays<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 54.</NOTE> <Q>Here let it be noted, that 'tis fully conceeded by the author, that the unrege|nerate, under con&s;ideration, have all degrees of light and conviction of divine truth, that can agree to an unregenerate &s;tate:&mdash;all that there is in a common work of the Spirit of God, preparatory to &s;av|ing faith, the inlightening of natural con&s;cience, <HI>putting the &s;inner upon reformation of life,</HI> &amp;c.</Q> It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eems that what he here de&s;ires may be <HI>noted,</HI> had entirely &s;lipped his mind before he had got four pages; for he then utterly denies that the author had conceded, or &s;o much as once mentioned any &s;uch thing!</P>

<P>I would al&s;o remark upon the following words. <Q>Upon this princi|ple, all the attainments of the unregenerate, &s;uch as awakening, con|viction, reformation, legal humiliation, and what&s;oever is preparatory to a &s;aving faith, are no grounds at all of thankfulne&s;s to God.

<P>The&s;e words are predicated upon my &s;aying, as Mr. M. has &s;agaci|ou&s;ly under&s;tood me, that all this conviction, &amp;c. of the unregenerate are of no &s;ervice to them, and an&s;wer no end, becau&s;e I introduced a queri&s;t a&s;king, what good the&s;e things did, that the matter might be

explained in my an&s;wer; which has been before ob&s;erved. Put at Mr. M. goes further than all this here, and repre&s;ents, that I had &s;aid, that on the account of the&s;e things, <HI>con&s;idered in them&s;elves,</HI> the unregenerate are not le&s;s wicked, than they would be without them, abandoning them&s;elves to all manner of wickedne&s;s. I am &s;ure I have not &s;aid or in|timated any &s;uch thing. All I &s;ay of the convinced &s;inner's not being le&s;s wicked, but more &s;o, is con&s;i&s;tent with the&s;e things being le&s;s &s;inful <HI>con&s;idered in them&s;elves;</HI> for I expre&s;sly place their greater &s;infulne&s;s, not in the&s;e things, but in &s;omething el&s;e.

<P>As for grounds of thankfulne&s;s for awakening, conviction, &amp;c. where is the difficulty, on &s;uppo&s;ition they are attended not with le&s;s, but greater &s;infulne&s;s?

This mu&s;t be true, el&s;e what Mr. M. &s;ays here is le&s;s than nothing to his purpo&s;e; even directly contrary to an important truth.</P>
<P>ANOTHER pa&s;&s;age of mine which Mr. M. has &s;een fit to remark upon, is the &s;imilitude of a father and two &s;ons. The &s;ons run off, de|termining to leave their father's hou&s;e and &s;ervice. The father calls after them, advi&s;es and commands them to return. One &s;tops and at|tends to what his father has to &s;ay to him: the other pays no regard to what his father &s;ays, but runs on till he gets out of hearing. I ob|&s;erved upon this that he who &s;topped and attended to what his father had to &s;ay, cannot properly be &s;aid to obey his father's command, if, after all, he refu&s;es to return; <Q>and may by the light and conviction laid before him by his father, in con&s;equence of his &s;topping and attending, be more guilty in refu&s;ing to &s;ubmit to him, than the other that has been out of hearing.</Q></P>
<P>This la&s;t &s;entence Mr. M. chiefly objects again&s;t. And fir&s;t he &s;ays "This &s;imilitude does by no means fully repre&s;ent the &s;tate of the ca&s;e."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 62.</NOTE></P>
<P>ANS. This &s;imilitude was not made with any particular reference to the general &s;tate of the ca&s;e between Mr. M. and me; but to illu&s;trate my an&s;wer to a particular objection which I was then con&s;idering.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Enq.

<P>However, let us &s;ee wherein it fails. Mr. M. &s;ays, <Q>Here is nothing of the awakened, reformed &s;inner, &s;ave only his making a pau&s;e, &s;topping his career, when running away, and attending to what his father had to &s;ay.</Q> I a&s;k, What more takes place in &s;uch a &s;inner, that is not here repre&s;ented? Mr. M. has not told. However, he pro|ceeds to "propo&s;e a query or two, lame and defective as it is."</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="011295_0054_0F869F028761E098">
He a&s;ks <Q>What was the true cau&s;e why A (the &s;on who run-off) &s;top|ped his ears, run off, &amp;c.&mdash;when B (the other &s;on) hearkened &s;o far as to &s;top his wicked cour&s;e, &amp;c.?&mdash;What can be the true cau&s;e of this difference, but a more wicked &s;tate of mind in A?</Q></P>
<P>ANS. The true cau&s;e of this might be &s;ome &s;ugge&s;tions made to B's mind, of the dreadful con&s;equence of thus leaving his father, &amp;c. which, were conveyed to him by or together with his father's words, and not to A. This, I own, mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed in order to make the ca&s;e in this re&s;pect repre&s;ent that of an awakened &s;inner. The awakened, reform|ed &s;inner, is brought to this &s;tate by influences on his mind and con&s;ci|ence, by which he is made to &s;ee, and, in a &s;en&s;e, feel the &s;ad and dan|gerous &s;tate he is in, which will immediately &s;top him in his career of open wickedne&s;s: I &s;ay this is the effect of influences on his mind and con&s;cience which A has not: Therefore it is not in the lea&s;t owing to the le&s;s wicked &s;tate of mind of B, that there is this difference. I won|der Mr. M. &s;hould a&s;k this que&s;tion, &s;ince he &s;o zealou&s;ly holds to the influences of the Spirit of God in awakening the con&s;ciences of &s;inners. If I had a&s;ked &s;uch a que&s;tion, Mr. M. would have had more rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect and <HI>in&s;inuate</HI> that I had <Q>an inclination to favor the NEW DI|VINITY, that entirely denies any preparatory work, in order to &s;aving faith, by the common influences of the Spirit,</Q> than he had from any thing that I have &s;aid.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See P. 55.</NOTE> Mr. M. &s;urely does not &s;uppo&s;e that in order to &s;inners being awakened by the Spirit of God, they mu&s;t fir&s;t become le&s;s &s;inful in the &s;tate of their minds than they were, or be le&s;s &s;inful than others. We &s;ee then the true rea&s;on why one &s;inner is awa|kened, and another is not, can ea&s;ily be given, without &s;uppo&s;ing a more wicked &s;tate of mind in the latter. And it is a little &s;trange Mr. M. could not think of it, in this ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. M. goes on to a&s;k, <Q>Will any one in this view of the ca&s;e &s;ay, that B is more wicked than A? What! Becau&s;e B is le&s;s bold, daring and fixed in his rebellion, and in ca&s;ting the utmo&s;t contempt on his father's authority?</Q></P>
<P>ANS. It does not appear that "B is le&s;s bold, daring and fixed in his rebellion, &amp;c." But the contrary appears to be true. B's con&s;cience is awakened to &s;ee the dreadful ruin that is before him, if he does not return home to his father, and he trembles at the thought of it. He is convinced in his con&s;cience it is his duty and highe&s;t intere&s;t to return home; that there is no other way to e&s;cape the evil he dreads; and that in this way he &s;hall certainly e&s;cape, and be made compleatly hap|py. Yet under all this light and conviction of con&s;cience, his heart ri&s;es again&s;t his father in a more direct and &s;tronger manner than ever it did before, in the mo&s;t horrid exerci&s;es of hatred, enmity, and fixed oppo&s;ition to his father's per&s;on, character and government; while he has not the lea&s;t inclination in his heart to &s;ubmit, or take one &s;tep homeward, but per&s;i&s;ts in an ob&s;tinate refu&s;al. A, it is true, is a rebel, and is wholly to blame for running off as he did; but he is not in tho&s;e circum&s;tances, in which he can be &s;o "bold and daring, and appear &s;o
<PB N="102" REF="011295_0055_0F869F0340D05020">
ob&s;tinately fixed in his rebellion as A. He has never had any realliz|ing apprehen&s;ions of the dreadful ruin which he is bringing on him&s;elf, but thinks all is well, and that he is pur&s;uing his own happine&s;s in leaving his father's hou&s;e. And he has very few thoughts and exerci&s;es about his father's government and family. B knows a thou&s;and times more about them, and about his duty and intere&s;t; and has ten thou|&s;and times more thoughts and exerci&s;es about this matter; and they are all in the mo&s;t direct oppo&s;ition to his father.</P>
<P>We are therefore now prepared to an&s;wer Mr. M's que&s;tion. "Will any one in this view of the ca&s;e &s;ay, that B is more wicked than A?" Yes, every one will &s;ay &s;o, who will hearken to the dictates of common &s;en&s;e. And he who &s;ays the contrary ju&s;tifies the wicked, even in the height of wickedne&s;s, and reproaches, and ca&s;ts a high degree of con|tempt on the father.</P>
<P>Mr. M. goes on to &s;ay, <Q>Should it be pleaded that B is more wicked than A, becau&s;e B di&s;covers a greater degree of tenderne&s;s and &s;en&s;i|bility of con&s;cience &s;inned again&s;t, than A in non-&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. I an|&s;wer, that to argue thus, would be prepo&s;terous and ab&s;urd to the la&s;t degree. For, upon this principle, the mo&s;t abandoned &s;inner under the go&s;pel, having wa&s;ted his con|&s;cience, and &s;inned away his moral &s;en&s;e, &s;o that he is pa&s;t feeling, as the &s;cripture expre&s;&s;eth it, may commit the mo&s;t atrocious wickedne&s;s, and yet be innocent, becau&s;e pa&s;t feeling. Whereas the truth in this ca&s;e is ju&s;t the rever&s;e; he, of the two under the &s;ame light and advantages, that can with the greate&s;t boldne&s;s and freedom commit the mo&s;t enormous wicked|ne&s;s, without remor&s;e or feeling of con&s;cience, is the more de&s;perate|ly wicked.</Q></P>
<P>Here Mr. M. again forgets him&s;elf, and &s;peaks of one who has by a cour&s;e of &s;inning again&s;t his con&s;cience got rid of his awakening and conviction; whereas A is not &s;uch an one; Nor am I &s;peaking of &s;uch. But what he &s;ays here in the la&s;t &s;entence, I think cannot be true. The &s;inner who is mo&s;t blind and ignorant with re&s;pect to his duty and true intere&s;t, and knows not that he is acting again&s;t either; &s;o does not &s;in at all again&s;t his con&s;cience, cannot be &s;o great a &s;inner as he, who has the greate&s;t light and conviction of con&s;cience relating to his duty and intere&s;t, and yet goes on in &s;in, in direct oppo&s;ition to this Yet this Mr. M. a&s;&s;erts here, but is it not mo&s;t &s;hockingly ab&s;urd! It is al&s;o directly, contrary to what he &s;ays el&s;ewhere, as he often &s;peaks of &s;ins again&s;t the light and dictates of con&s;cience as peculiarly aggravated. And this he &s;uppo&s;es in this very paragraph; for he &s;peaks of <HI>wa&s;ting con&s;cience,</HI> as the great crime of the abandoned &s;inner. The&s;e two &s;entences therefore &s;tand in direct contradiction one to the other. The fir&s;t a&s;&s;erts <HI>him</HI> to be the greate&s;t &s;inner, who has mo&s;t oppo&s;ed his con|&s;cience for his having <HI>wa&s;ted his con&s;cience,</HI> and <HI>&s;inned away his moral &s;en&s;e,</HI> as that wherein his great &s;infulne&s;s lies. The la&s;t a&s;&s;erts <HI>him</HI> to be the greate&s;t &s;inner, who never had, and now has not any light and conviction of con&s;cience; and &s;o has never had opportunity to <HI>wa&s;te his con&s;cience,</HI> or &s;in again&s;t it; for here his great &s;infulne&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in
<PB N="103" REF="011295_0055_0F869F0340D05020">
&s;inning <HI>without remor&s;e or feeling of con&s;cience,</HI> i. e. without any light and conviction of con&s;cience. I leave it to the reader, whether "to argue thus" is not more than "prepo&s;terous and ab&s;urd to the la&s;t degree."</P>
<P>Mr. M. adds, <Q>But perhaps the grand plea in re&s;erve, to evince that B is more faulty than A (if different from what has already been &s;aid) is, that B has a higher degree of internal light and conviction, that 'tis his duty to &s;ubmit to his father, than A had, therefore more guilty.</Q></P>
<P>This I think is not really "different from what has already been &s;aid;" as <HI>tenderne&s;s</HI> and <HI>&s;en&s;ibility of con&s;cience</HI> mu&s;t be the &s;ame thing with <HI>light and conviction of con&s;cience</HI> in the unregenerate. He has there|fore made no advance, the <HI>plea</HI> is exactly the &s;ame with that which he mentioned and an&s;wered before. But perhaps he has a better an&s;wer now. It is this: If A has not &s;o much light and conviction as B, it is altogether A's fault that he has not. And <Q>if it be entirely and merely A's fault, &s;hall not A be dealt with, as if he had that light and con|viction in his con&s;cience, which only, and merely his own fault, wil|fully &s;topping his ears, impeded his hearing?</Q></P>
<P>This an&s;wer is quite different from the former, and even in direct contradiction to that. Whether it is better, is now to be inquired. I &s;ay it is a contradiction to the foregoing, becau&s;e there he places the great crime of the &s;inner, not in &s;inning again&s;t the light of his con|&s;cience; but in &s;inning without any light and conviction. But here he has &s;hifted the crime, and places it in &s;inning again&s;t that light, which tho' the &s;inner has not actually, yet he has virtually, becau&s;e it is wholly his own fault that he has it not: &s;o is looked upon and treated by God as actually "&s;inning again&s;t all that light, which he wilfully refu&s;ed."</P>
<P>It is granted that A is an&s;werable for <HI>not having,</HI> and <HI>rejecting</HI> that light and conviction, which by his own fault he has not. But it will not be granted that he is an&s;werable for actually &s;inning again&s;t that light which he never had; and that he will be looked upon and dealt with by God, as if he actually had this light, and actually &s;inned again&s;t it; for this would be to look upon him, and treat him contrary to the truth. There is a real and great difference between him, who actually has light and conviction in his con&s;cience, and him, who has it not, whatever may be the cau&s;e of this difference. And to look upon them and treat them, as if there was no difference, is certainly to contradict the truth of fact.</P>
<P>If Mr. M's po&s;ition is true, the mo&s;t &s;tupid, blind and ignorant per|&s;on under the go&s;pel is as guilty, as great a &s;inner, in not embracing the go&s;pel, as he who has the greate&s;t degree of light and conviction of con&s;cience, and yet per&s;i&s;ts in the highe&s;t exerci&s;es of enmity again&s;t Chri&s;t, and oppo&s;ition to all the light he has. And he who is guilty of &s;topping his ears, and putting him&s;elf out of the way and beyond the reach of all means of light and in&s;truction, by one act, is as great a &s;in|ner as he who &s;pends a whole life in the mo&s;t horrid acts of rebellion and enmity again&s;t God, contrary to the cleare&s;t light of his con&s;cience:
<PB N="104" REF="011295_0056_0F869F0408B47848">
&s;o that one &s;ingle act which occa&s;ions ignorance in refu&s;ing to admit the light that is offered, is as great a crime, and carries as much guilt in it, as all the actions of high rebellion and enmity again&s;t God, in op|po&s;ition to the cleare&s;t light and conviction of con&s;cience, thro' a whole eternity. This mu&s;t be &s;o, if A is accountable for &s;inning again&s;t all that light which he wilfully refu&s;ed, and &s;o had not; and is as guilty as B, who actually had it, and yet &s;inned again&s;t it. A heathen, for in&s;tance, who was once invited and had a fair opportunity to come into a chri&s;tian country, and enjoy the light of the go&s;pel, and refu&s;ed; and &s;o lives and dies in heatheni&s;h darkne&s;s, is as guilty as he who has liv|ed all his days under the light of the go&s;pel, and had great and clear light and conviction of con&s;cience and has con&s;tantly abu&s;ed and re|belled again&s;t it all, in ten thou&s;ands acts of the mo&s;t horrid enmity again&s;t God, which the heathen never was guilty of, it being impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould in his circum&s;tances. And according to this, the mo&s;t igno|rant creature under the go&s;pel will be reckoned and dealt with by God as having abu&s;ed all the light which he might have had, had he been perfectly holy from his childhood to the end of his life; and will be found as guilty, as if he actually had all this light, and had all his days abu&s;ed, and &s;inned again&s;t it all. And Paul, who did many things again&s;t Chri&s;t and his church in ignorance and unbelief, was as guilty as if he had all the light and conviction that Peter, or any of the apo&s;|tles had, and mu&s;t have been dealt with accordingly, had he not ob|tained forgivene&s;s.</P>
<P>I may here &s;ay in Mr. M's word?, "I appeal to the impartial reader, Whether the&s;e be not ab&s;urdities by no means to be admitted in divi|nity? And whether it is <HI>po&s;&s;ible</HI> to avoid them, the principle advanced being admitted?"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 23.</NOTE></P>
<P>The only argument Mr. M. produces to &s;upport this contradictory a&s;&s;ertion is, the words of Chri&s;t with re&s;pect to the Jews: "But now have they both &s;een, and hated, both me and my father."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Joh.

The divine character was clearly &s;et before them, in the per&s;on and character of Chri&s;t; and this they di&s;approved and hated; and that whether they were convinced in their judgment and con&s;ciences that this was indeed the divine character or not. In this &s;en&s;e they did &s;ee and hate both the Son and the Father; of this they were actually guilty, and were treated, and will be reckoned with accordingly. But it does not follow from this that they who were convinced in their con|&s;ciences that he was the Chri&s;t, and yet rejected him; and they who verily thought he was an impo&s;tor, were equally guilty, and that the latter will be reckoned and dealt with, as if they actually had the light and conviction of the former, which they had not. Thanks be to God!

<ARGUMENT>
<P>IN which it is con&s;idered, whether the doctrine that the awakened, convinced &s;inner is more guilty and vile in the con&s;tant and painful attendance on the means of grace, than when he was in a &s;tate of &s;ecurity and open profligacy, is an encouragement to &s;inners to abandon them&s;elves to carele&s;ne&s;s and vice, or any matter of di&s;|couragement to an attendance on means?</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. M. has repre&s;ented the matter in this light, thro' his whole book. He &s;uppo&s;es that awakened, convinced &s;inners grow|ing <HI>le&s;s &s;inful</HI> in the u&s;e of means, is matter of encouragement to attend; and that the contrary doctrine tends greatly to di&s;courage them. And this he has particularly pre&s;&s;ed in the following pa&s;&s;age.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 122.</NOTE> <Q>The&s;e things, to the be&s;t of my &s;mall di&s;cernment, naturally tend either to quiet &s;ecure &s;inners in the carele&s;s neglect of means, going on in their &s;ins; or to damp and retard tho&s;e that are &s;eriou&s;ly inclined to exert them&s;elves, in a painful attendance on means and amend|ment of life: Since every &s;tep they take this way, while unregene|rate, they are on the whole involved in greater guilt, than they would have been had they continued in the wilful, carele&s;s neglect of means, ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ting in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t wickedne&s;s, as above, under the &s;ame go&s;pel.</Q> And in the next page he &s;ays that to deny that the awakened, convinced &s;inner may be le&s;s &s;inful, than in a &s;tate of &s;ecurity and open wickedne&s;s, <Q>is to lay a &s;tumbling block in &s;in|ners way, and to rob them of a precious branch of encouragement allowed them from the word of God, to &s;trive and run for eternal life, in all painful endeavours in the u&s;e of means,</Q> And again he

&s;ays,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 88.</NOTE> <Q>While we attempt to &s;care men from tru&s;ting in their duties, care mu&s;t be had that we don't &s;care them from their duties, either by in&s;inuating that they are more vile in that attendance they are ca|pable of, while unregenerate, than in the neglect of it; and he puts the following que&s;tion to me; whether this way of rea&s;oning in favour of A, as tho' he might expect &s;ome notable abatement of his guilt, by &s;topping his ears and going out of hearing, don't carry in it too much encouragement to the &s;inners A repre&s;ents, who abandon them&s;elves to wickedne&s;s, and neglect the means of grace: Since they are &s;uffici|ently inclined in them&s;elves, without the help of others, to devi&s;e pleas in their own favor.<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">P. 65.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Mr. M. has not mentioned this as one of his arguments again&s;t the doctrine he &s;ets him&s;elf to oppo&s;e, where he undertakes to produce argu|ments again&s;t it; but as is evident, he de&s;igns it as an argument not of the lea&s;t weight, and it will probably have more influence with &s;ome, than any thing el&s;e that he has offered. I therefore propo&s;e particularly to con&s;ider it in this &s;ection.</P>
<P>In order to determine whether there is any truth in this, we mu&s;t con|&s;ider what are the motives which will induce the unregenerate to act or forbear acting in any ca&s;e; or what is the principle they act upon, or the end which they always have in view. If we can find what the&s;e are, we may ea&s;ily determine what tends to di&s;courage, or to encourage them in all ca&s;es; for this will be ju&s;t according to the motives by which they are influenced. And here I &s;uppo&s;e all will allow that the unregenerate are always influenced in all they do by what may be called <HI>&s;elfi&s;h</HI> mo|tives. They are always &s;eeking and pur&s;uing that which is in their view, or &s;eems to them to be for their own intere&s;t, and never act from any higher motive. The &s;ecure &s;inner, whether he is an open profligate, or not, is pu&s;uing &s;ome good in this world as his happine&s;s, becau&s;e it &s;eems to him his own highe&s;t good in this &s;tate. The &s;inner who&s;e con&s;cience is awakened in &s;ome mea&s;ure to reallize a judgment to come, and future &s;tate, and the dreadful end to which the &s;inner is expo&s;ed to come every moment, at once lo&s;es his keen appetite for the plea&s;ures of time and &s;en&s;e, and all his plea&s;ing worldly pro&s;pects, and &s;chemes drop and die, and he begins to feel that his whole intere&s;t lies in another world; and that he &s;hall be happy or mi&s;erable forever, according as he e&s;capes hell and obtains heaven, or not. This excites in him the grand and impor|tant inquiry," What mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved?" And he is willing to take any method, and u&s;e any means, con&s;i&s;tent with his continuing a perfect enemy to God, and holine&s;s, or his duty, which &s;hall be pre&s;cribed to him, as the mo&s;t likely way to e&s;cape the evil which he dreads, and obtain the good which he de&s;ires; or in other words, that &s;hall appear mo&s;t likely to promote his eternal intere&s;t.</P>
<P>He is by the &s;uppo&s;ition, no more a friend to God and holine&s;s now, or an enemy to &s;in, than he was before. And really cares not how much God is di&s;honored, and whether he is a greater or le&s;s &s;inner, if he may but an&s;wer his own ends. He does not fear and dread &s;in, for its own &s;ake, or in it&s;elf con&s;idered: but purely becau&s;e of the con&s;equence to
<PB N="108" REF="011295_0058_0F869F08D84804C8">
him, which he now dreads. He is not afraid of &s;in, or de&s;ires to avoid it, from any true re&s;pect he has to God, and merely becau&s;e it is again&s;t him, and di&s;honorable and offen&s;ive to him; but purely from his fear of eternal puni&s;hment. This being the ca&s;e, it is ea&s;y to &s;ee it would be in vain to tell him that he will be le&s;s guilty and vile in God's &s;ight, in con&s;equence of his attending on means, &amp;c. For this in it&s;elf would not be the lea&s;t encouragement and motive to him to attend. And ju&s;t as much in vain would it be to tell him, in order to di&s;&s;uade him from at|tendance on means, that if he continued impenitent, he would be more guilty and vile, than the carele&s;s &s;inner; for this will not be the lea&s;t di&s;|couragement to him, &s;o long as he views this the mo&s;t likely way to be &s;aved.</P>
<P>If therefore the &s;inner can be per&s;uaded, that the probability of his being &s;aved or lo&s;t does not depend upon his being a greater &s;inner or a le&s;s; but he is the mo&s;t likely to be &s;aved, who attends mo&s;t con&s;tantly and earne&s;tly on the means of grace, in the cleare&s;t view and &s;en&s;e of the important truths revealed in the bible, and con&s;tant attention to them; and that this is the only hopeful way: I &s;ay, if he can be convinced of this, it will be a &s;ufficient motive and encouragement to him to attend, and will influence him, in proportion to his belief, and &s;en&s;e of a future &s;tate, and of the &s;ad and mi&s;erable ca&s;e in which he now is. And no other motive can be thought of, that will have the lea&s;t influence on him, to encourage him to attend on means, or as matter of di&s;couragement. In a word, the unregenerate &s;inner dreads &s;in only as connected with mi|&s;ery; therefore he dreads that &s;in mo&s;t, which, in his view, mo&s;t expo&s;es him to de&s;truction, and is mo&s;t likely to ruin him forever; but the&s;e are the &s;ins committed in a &s;tate of &s;ecurity, or in the neglect of means, and not tho&s;e committed under awakenings and convictions, and in a con&s;tant attendance on means; however more heinous and vile the latter are than the former. Therefore the &s;inner only needs to be well in&s;tructed, in order to have all the encouragement he is capable of to attend on means. Let him be convinced that this is the mo&s;t likely cour&s;e he can take to be &s;aved, and that there is no other likely way, however great may be the guilt he contracts while he continues impenitent, and it will be a &s;trong and prevalent motive with him to take it, in proportion to his dread of eternal de&s;truction, and de&s;ire of future happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. M. does therefore in the pa&s;&s;ages above cited go upon a &s;uppo|&s;ition, which is directly contrary to the truth, viz. That the unregene|rate do fear and dread &s;in on its own account, without any con&s;ideration of its con&s;equence; and have &s;ome true re&s;pect to God and holine&s;s; drop this &s;uppo&s;ition, and they appear to be without any foundation at all. If the &s;inner fears and hates &s;in, for its own &s;ake, and from re&s;pect to God, why then does he go on in &s;in? Let him for&s;ake it, and all is well. If therefore he does neglect means, and live in known ways of open &s;in, under a pretence that he is afraid of that greater &s;in he &s;hall be guilty of, if he attends on means and becomes a convinced &s;inner; it is certain it is but pretence in which there is no truth: for if he is afraid of greater &s;infulne&s;s, why not of le&s;s; why does he go on in known &s;in? If he hates
<PB N="109" REF="011295_0058_0F869F08D84804C8">
&s;in; and hence &s;incerely de&s;ires to be delivered from it, why does he not leave off &s;inning and fly to Chri&s;t the only deliverer?</P>
<P>If a &s;inner objects again&s;t attempting to pray, and &s;ays he is afraid to do it, becau&s;e the prayer of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord. He may be a&s;ked what he is afraid of? If he is indeed afraid of &s;in; and &s;o avoids prayer that he may avoid &s;in, why is he not equally concerned to avoid all &s;in, or &s;in in any other way? If he is willing to do this, he may pray without &s;inning; and &s;o the objection cea&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> But if he is not willing to leave off &s;inning, but is determined to go on, then there is no &s;incerity or weight in the objection, for he really cares not how much &s;in he commits, and he is indifferent whether he &s;ins in one way or another. Be&s;ides, if he is afraid of &s;inning in prayer, left he &s;hould be damned for it; why does he not fear &s;inning in any other way, for the &s;ame rea&s;on; for the &s;ins men commit in praying, are no more likely to prove fatal to them, than any other way of &s;inning: Yea this is the only likely way to e&s;cape de&s;truction, and obtain &s;alvation.</P>
<P>It will be laid, perhaps, tho' the attendance on means, &amp;c. is the only likely way to obtain &s;alvation, however guilty and vile the &s;inner may be in this way; yet, if he finally mi&s;carries and fails of &s;alvation, he will be more mi&s;erable than if he had neglected all means and abandoned him&s;elf to the &s;ins of a &s;tate of &s;ecurity; and the &s;ecure &s;inner will be hence induced to continue in his old way, and it will be a di&s;couragement with all in the way of attendance on means. I an&s;wer. If any one &s;hould neglect the means of grace on this pretence, he would be &s;elf-condemned. For there is no per&s;on who is not almo&s;t con&s;tantly run|ning ventures in hopes of obtaining his end, when he knows that if he fails of the end propo&s;ed, he &s;hall lo&s;e all his pains and co&s;t, and will be, on the whole, a great lo&s;er, &s;o that he had better not have been at the pains and expence, than to do this, and yet fail of the end in view. And the more intere&s;ting and important the affair is, in a per&s;on's view, the greater venture will he run as a means to obtain it, and the greater will be his care and attention in the matter. While men are conducting thus in their temporal affairs, and are pretending the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of doing &s;o in concerns of infinitely greater moment, and hence refu&s;ing to run any venture in the latter ca&s;e, we may be &s;ure there is no &s;incerity, and that this is not the bottom of the matter. Be&s;ides, this objection may be as well made by a heathen, to whom it is propo&s;ed to go and live in a country where the go&s;pel is preached, or by any others, again&s;t taking pains to put them&s;elves under greater religious advantages than they now enjoy. For if they &s;hould enjoy the&s;e advantages, and abu&s;e them, as the mo&s;t do who have them, their condemnation will be greater, and they be more mi&s;erable forever, than if they had never enjoyed them.&mdash;If it &s;hould be &s;aid, that if they become awakened, convinced, reformed &s;inners, they will be le&s;s &s;inful, and not quilty, or mi&s;erable, tho' they peri&s;h, as if they had not enjoyed tho&s;e &s;uperior advantages: I &s;ay, if this &s;hould be &s;aid, and granted; yet it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved that they are altogether uncertain that they ever &s;hall be &s;uch: or that they &s;hall not abu&s;e all their advantages &s;o as to become much more guilty and vile, than if they
<PB N="110" REF="011295_0059_0F869F0A0DA8D380">
never had enjoyed them. Therefore they know not, but every &s;tep they take to obtain any religious advantage, will be wor&s;e than lo&s;t, and be|come the occa&s;ion of their greater guilt, and more awful condemnation.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, if the doctrine of awakened convinced &s;inners growing wor&s;e, more guilty and vile, is any ju&s;t ground of di&s;couragement, to take u&s;e of means, then there is ju&s;t ground of di&s;couragement: to take any pains to enjoy any religious means and advantages what&s;oever, or to u&s;e any with others, by preaching the go&s;pel to them, &amp;c. For unle&s;s God pre|vents it by his &s;overeign grace, all this will be but the occa&s;ion of their greater &s;infulne&s;s, and more aggravated de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Mr. M and every one el&s;e may therefore be &s;ure that the doctrine of the &s;inner's growing more vile in the u&s;e of means, if his eyes are fully opened, does not give the lea&s;t encouragement to any, "to abandon them|&s;elves to wickedne&s;s, and neglect the means of grace;" and never was, nor can be rea&s;onably improved &s;o by any. Nor does it tend in the lea&s;t degree to "damp and retard tho&s;e that are &s;eriou&s;ly inclined to exert them&s;elves in a painful attendance on means and amendment of life." So far from this, that it is the only doctrine that can give proper and con&s;i&s;tent encouragement to tho&s;e who are under clear and genuine con|victions; and the contrary tends directly to drive &s;uch into di&s;courage|ment and de&s;pair.</P>
<P>This I particularly ob&s;erved, and endeavoured to make quite clear and evident in the conclu&s;ion of my &s;ection on means, in the following words,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 144, 145.</NOTE> <Q>If &s;inners were to take their only encouragement to hope for &s;alvation in the u&s;e of means, from their being le&s;s &s;inners than others, <HI>or not &s;o bad as they once were,</HI> this would tend to take all encourage|ment from tho&s;e, who are under genuine convictions, and have any true view of their own &s;infulne&s;s, and leave them in ab&s;olute de&s;pair. For all &s;uch, as they have a more clear and full fight of their own &s;ins than they can have of others, are naturally led to view them&s;elves as the greate&s;t &s;inners. And as by attendance on means, they get more and more acquainted with their own hearts, their own &s;infulne&s;s in|crea&s;es in their view, they are &s;o far from looking on them&s;elves as le&s;s &s;inners than they were, that they naturally view them&s;elves in a con|trary light.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The only proper way therefore to encourage the &s;inner, who is un|der any great degree of genuine conviction of &s;in, and concern about his eternal intere&s;t, to attend on means with hope, is not to lead him to expect hereby to become le&s;s &s;inful; but to teach him the true end and de&s;ign of means. He will then know that the great wickedne&s;s of his heart, exerci&s;ed in all he does, and his appearing to him&s;elf to grow wor&s;e rather than better, which is commonly the chief ground of di&s;couragement to &s;uch, is really no rea&s;on why he &s;hould neglect means; but rather an encouragement con&s;tantly to attend.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. M in&s;tead of taking any notice of my argument here, wholly o|verlooks what I had in view, viz. To &s;hew that the doctrine I had ad|vanced could be no di&s;couragement to the &s;inner under proper awaken|ings and convictions; becau&s;e he always views him&s;elf in the very light

in which this doctrine &s;ets him, i. e. as con&s;tantly growing wor&s;e, more wicked and vile: and that the contrary doctrine, viz.

And might I not, in this view, once mention the &s;inner's <HI>appearing to him&s;elf</HI> to grow wor&s;e, when the argument I was upon required it; and when in&s;tead of this to have &s;po|ken of the &s;inner's <HI>really</HI> growing wor&s;e, would have been quite non&s;en&s;e, without being accu&s;ed with going off from my point, coming down wonderfully, &amp;c. as it I was afraid in the clo&s;e to a&s;&s;ert what I had be|fore advanced, and endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h?</P>
<P>There are two leading principles that run thro' Mr. M's book, which I had in view, and endeavoured to confute in the three la&s;t pages of my &s;ection on means. One is, that the only way for a per&s;on to be more likely to be &s;aved, or not far from the kingdom of God, is to become le&s;s &s;inful and &s;o nearer the &s;tate of a good man, God being more ready and di&s;po&s;ed to &s;hew mercy to a le&s;s &s;inner, than to a greater. The whole he &s;ays on the &s;inner's being not far from the kingdom of God &s;ets the matter in this light. And from this he infers in the following words, <Q>There is &s;uch a thing among the unregenerate under the go&s;pel, as be|ing in &s;tate nigh to or not far from the kingdom of God." And that their nearne&s;s in &s;tate to the kingdom of God, or which is the &s;ame, to that of a good man, con&s;i&s;ts in tho&s;e attainments whereby they are, on the whole, in the &s;tate of their minds le&s;s vicious than either them|&s;elves or others would be in the ab&s;ence of tho&s;e things.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P. 26, 27.</NOTE></Q> And again,
<PB N="112" REF="011295_0060_0F869F0B49D89970">
he &s;peaks of the attainments of the unregenerate, &s;uch as awakening, conviction, reformation, &amp;c. as that <Q>whereby they are le&s;s wicked, and, in a true &s;en&s;e of &s;cripture, in &s;tate brought nearer to the king|dom of God, to a &s;tate of grace,</Q> &amp;c.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">P. 59.</NOTE> And in another place he repre&s;ents the &s;inner who is le&s;s di&s;plea&s;ing to God, to be more in the way of mercy, &s;o more likely to be &s;aved. Speaking of the awakened, convinced &s;inner, and the carele&s;s and &s;ecure, he &s;ays the &s;cripture <Q>gives a &s;ort of preference to the former, at lea&s;t, as le&s;s di&s;plea&s;ing to God, and more in the way in which God's &s;overeign mercy is won't to be displayed.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 96.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>The other principle I have reference to is grounded upon this, viz; That if a per&s;on grows, not le&s;s &s;inful, but more guilty and vile in the u&s;e of means, this is matter of great di&s;couragement and that &s;inners cannot be encouraged to attend on means in any other view, but that they may hereby become le&s;s &s;inful and vil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>
<P>Had Mr. M. attended to the&s;e pages, and taken what I think is the plain meaning of them; in&s;tead of making the gro&s;s blunder and mi&s;|repre&s;entation he has done, he mu&s;t have been &s;en&s;ible, that what I here &s;aid, was in oppo&s;ition to the&s;e two principles, and found him|&s;elf concerned to an&s;wer it. But he has been &s;o far from this, that he has, in effect, conceded to it all, and very emphatically pronounced it orthodox.</P>
<P>The reader will here particularly ob&s;erve what he has pronounced orthodox. "His appearing to him&s;elf to grow wor&s;e, is really no rea|&s;on why he &s;hould neglect means, <HI>but rather an encouragement con&s;tantly to attend.</HI> "Fully orthodox this!" And he allows that this generally or always is the ca&s;e with &s;inners under deep and genuine conviction, in the beginning of his book, where he &s;ays, <Q>Divines of the be&s;t cha|racter and greate&s;t note, have allowed that &s;inners under deep and genuine convictions, conver&s;ing more &s;en&s;ibly with the wickedne&s;s of their own hearts and lives, have been ready to look on them&s;elves as greater &s;inners than heretofore; yea, perhaps as growing daily wor&s;e, and more hard hearted.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 7.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Upon this, the following things are ob&s;ervable.</P>
<P N="1">1. If the &s;inner's <HI>appearing to him&s;elf</HI> to grow wor&s;e more guilty an1d vile, in the u&s;e of means, is no rea&s;on why he &s;hould neglect means; than his really growing wor&s;e is no matter of di&s;couragement. For what <HI>appears</HI> to be true to the &s;inner, mu&s;t have ju&s;t as much influence as if it was really &s;o, until the appearance is removed, and the &s;inner is convinced he was mi&s;taken. Therefore if this appearance is no di&s;|couragement, or rea&s;on why he &s;hould neglect means; It's being really &s;o is no di&s;couragement. This is therefore at lea&s;t implicitly a&s;&s;erted in the&s;e words: and con&s;equently Mr. M. has a&s;&s;erted it in the &s;tronge&s;t manner, by pronouncing them orthodox, in the terms he has. What then becomes of all that he has &s;aid, repre&s;enting this as a di&s;couraging doctrine, <Q>tending to damp and retard tho&s;e that are &s;incerely inclined to exert them&s;elves,</Q> &amp;c. <Q>and laying a &s;tumbling block in &s;inners way, and robbing them of a precious branch of encouragement, &amp;c?</Q>
<PB N="113" REF="011295_0060_0F869F0B49D89970">
He has here given all this up, as contrary to rea&s;on and truth; &s;o has once more run into gro&s;s &s;elf-contradiction.</P>
<P>It hence appears al&s;o, how unrea&s;onable Mr. M. is in repre&s;enting me as not daring to bring this principle out, and &s;ays here, <Q>The awa|kened &s;inner's <HI>really</HI> growing wor&s;e in attendance on means, &amp;c&mdash;more vile than he would have been, continuing &s;ecure, &amp;c.&mdash;<HI>is re|ally no rea&s;on why he &s;hould neglect means.</HI></Q> For it is really brought out and a&s;&s;erted in the words I have u&s;ed, as has been ju&s;t ob&s;erved: and Mr. M. has given his &s;anction to it al&s;o in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, however "&s;tartling to the common reader" he may think it will be.</P>
<P N="2">2. If the &s;inner under genuine and thorough convictions appears to him&s;elf to be much wor&s;e than he was in a &s;tate of &s;ecurity; then the doctrine that the &s;inner under true convictions does grow le&s;s &s;inful and vile, and that this is the only way in which he may hope to be &s;aved, will do him no good; but will be the mo&s;t di&s;couraging doctrine that can be preached to him, and drive him to de&s;pair, if he believes it.</P>
<P>It cannot do him any good, or be any encouragement to him to be told that he is now le&s;s &s;inful and vile than he was; for by the &s;uppo|&s;ition he will not believe it, but is confident that the contrary is true. But if he is taught, and he believes it, that this mu&s;t be true of him, in order to his being in a likely way to be &s;aved; this will be &s;o far from encouraging him to go on, that he will conclude him&s;elf to be in a very bad way indeed, that his attendance on means has done him hurt rather than good; and &s;o will give out, concluding that there is no hope for him in this way. Mr. M. has therefore, I think, by his own acknowledgement, in effect given up the whole book he has wrote, as quite u&s;ele&s;s, and to no purpo&s;e. For the doctrine he contends for can never be inculcated on the unregenerate, &s;o as to be of any &s;ervice to them; but mu&s;t be carefully kept out of their hearing, le&s;t it prove very mi&s;chievous.</P>
<P>Let us &s;ee how the doctrine of Mr. M's book mu&s;t be applied to the unregenerate. He will tell the &s;ecure profligate that he mu&s;t reform, and earne&s;tly attend on all means of grace: and for his encouragement will a&s;&s;ure him, that in this way he will grow better, le&s;s &s;inful and vile; and &s;o get into a more likely way to be &s;aved, and more in the way of God's mercy; in which he has no rea&s;on to expect to &s;hare &s;o long as he is &s;o guilty and vile as he is at pre&s;ent. And the more he will reform, and the le&s;s &s;inful he &s;hall become; the nearer he will come to &s;aving conver&s;ion, and the more likely will he be to obtain it. If the &s;inner believes what he &s;ays, and from this encouragement re|forms all ways of known external &s;in; and begins to attend on means; he may go on with good courage, and in his own view have a great degree of tenderne&s;s of con&s;cience, and carefully avoid all known &s;in, and come up to all known duty. And if he is not led into the know|ledge of his own heart, and has no genuine conviction of &s;in, and is not convinced of the great &s;in of not loving God and believing on Chri&s;t, he will have high hopes from his imagined comparative goodne&s;s, or his becoming le&s;s &s;inful than he was, by his reformations and duties,
<PB N="114" REF="011295_0061_0F869F0B7A4B04F8">
and be confident that God is not &s;o angry with him now; but takes a favorable notice of his doings and looks on him with approbation. He will now drink in Mr. M's doctrine with greedine&s;s, and it will be &s;weet and comfortable to his &s;oul. But alas! Whither will it lead him? To the &s;ame place, no doubt to which the proud phari&s;ee went.</P>
<P>But if by the divine influences he falls under genuine, thorough con|victions, he will begin to appear to him&s;elf to be growing more guilty and vile than he was in a &s;tate of &s;ecurity, in&s;tead of becoming le&s;s &s;in|ful, as he was encouraged to expect. This &s;inks his heart, all his hopes fail him; and he runs to Mr. M. to know what he &s;hall do. What will Mr. M. &s;ay to him? Will he tell him, this is no matter of di&s;cou|ragement; he has as much encouragement to go on as ever, altho' he continues to grow wor&s;e and wor&s;e? If he tells him this, which he has in effect declared to be fully orthodox; he will now retract and di|rectly contradict all he had preached to him before, and which is the fundamental doctrine of his whole book, as what he had better never have publi&s;hed; for it is not true, and has done no good, but hurt.</P>
<P>If he per&s;i&s;ts in his former doctrine, and tells the &s;inner that tho' he appears to him&s;elf to be more &s;inful; yet this is not his <HI>true</HI> &s;tate; if it was he would be in a bad and hopele&s;s way indeed: But he is really growing much better, le&s;s &s;inful and vile than he was, &s;o that God's anger is in a mea&s;ure abated: He has reformed many gro&s;s &s;ins, and done many duties, of all which God graciou&s;ly approves, and takes a favorable no|tice: And if he holds on, he will undoubtedly become in this way &s;o much le&s;s &s;inful than others, or than he once was, that God will be&s;tow &s;alvation upon him, rather than upon tho&s;e who are more guilty and vile, having never reformed, and humbled them&s;elves at the feet of &s;overeign mercy as he has done, nor nouri&s;hed &s;uch tenderne&s;s of con|&s;cience, &amp;c. I &s;ay, if he &s;hould preach this, or, which is much the &s;ame, read over his book to him; the &s;inner will either believe it, or he will not. If he believes it, and is brought to view him&s;elf not as growing wor&s;e, but le&s;s &s;inful, his convictions are at an end, he is no longer under genuine thorough convictions; for &s;uch appear to them|&s;elves at lea&s;t, to grow more &s;inful and vile. Therefore in order to be|lieve Mr. M's doctrine he mu&s;t lo&s;e his convictions; and they never can take place again, until he gives this doctrine up, and &s;o per&s;everance in the belief of this doctrine will infallibly carry him to hell, unle&s;s a &s;inner may be converted without a proper work of conviction.</P>
<P>If he does not believe it, and it is to be de&s;ired in mercy to his &s;oul he way not; for we, and Mr. M. too are &s;ure that he cannot as long at his convictions continue: I &s;ay, if he does not believe it, he will e&s;cape the mi&s;chief, and all the pains taken to inculcate it will be in vain.</P>
<P>If he believes it in <HI>part,</HI> viz. that &s;inners under genuine convictions do become le&s;s &s;inful, as the only hopeful way to be &s;aved; and yet by the force of his own convictions appears to him&s;elf to be growing more &s;inful; this will have a very bad, di&s;couraging tendency indeed, as has been ob&s;erved, and drive him into de&s;pair, as being too great a &s;inner ever to hope for God's mercy. In order to relieve this &s;inner Mr. M. mu&s;t give up his great doctrine, which he wrote his book to defend;
<PB N="115" REF="011295_0061_0F869F0B7A4B04F8">
he mu&s;t do it for a while at lea&s;t, as he has indeed done by the pa&s;&s;age under con&s;ideration, and tell him, that he may grow wor&s;e, more wick|ed and vile, and yet be in a hopeful way, and have all po&s;&s;ible encou|ragement to attend; for the end of the u&s;e of means to the unregene|rate is not to make them le&s;s &s;inful, but to lead them to that know|ledge and &s;en&s;e of their true &s;tate and character which the unregenerate may have. Thus the &s;inner mu&s;t believe the doctrine which I have ad|vanced, as long as his convictions continue and increa&s;e, or fall into de&s;pair; and can receive no other encouragement, but what is con&s;i&s;tent with this doctrine, of the &s;inners growing wor&s;e under convictions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and what is directly contrary to that of Mr. M.</P>
<P>Mr. M. concludes this general head in the following words, <Q>Now if in the author's view, it appeared too &s;tartling to a common reader to clo&s;e his di&s;cour&s;e with this plain repre&s;entation of the &s;tate of the ca&s;e in debate; it had been a great favor, in my humble opinion, if he had been under the &s;ame re&s;traint when he advanced it. To be &s;ure it had prevented me the&s;e my <HI>poor labours</HI> on the &s;ubject. And I think I may &s;ay with good a&s;&s;urance, it had prevented grief to many worthy fathers in the mini&s;try, who&s;e prai&s;e is in the go&s;pel thro' the churches; and who are not &s;o far <HI>&s;uperannuated,</HI> but that with good old Eli, they <HI>tremble</HI> for fear of the ark, when they &s;ee it in danger of a wrong touch, from the vigor and &s;prightline&s;s of younger years.</Q></P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved, and clearly &s;hewed, I pre&s;ume, that I am quite clear of the charge which Mr. M. has brought again&s;t me, upon which, the words now tran&s;cribed are grounded; that I could not have ex|pre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf in the words which he pre&s;cribes for me, without for|getting the argument I was upon, and being guilty of as great an oversight nearly as he has in making this charge.&mdash;And that what he &s;ays I ought to have &s;aid, is implied in my words; and &s;o implicitly a&s;|&s;erted. And that he has fully a&s;&s;ented to it, and pronounced it ortho|dox, in the &s;ame breath, in which he attempts to repre&s;ent it &s;o gro&s;s and &s;hocking an error, as to &s;tartle a common reader.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s I am not a&s;hamed of this doctrine; nor am I afraid to a&s;&s;ert it, in its full length and breadth on all proper occa&s;ions. Nor do I repent my publi&s;hing it; but think I have rea&s;on to ble&s;s God that I have been under no <HI>re&s;traint</HI> that has prevented it, even although it has occa&s;ioned "The&s;e POOR <HI>labours</HI> of Mr. M on the &s;ubject:" Yea, what|ever el&s;e I may &s;uffer by it. Whether he had any call thus to exert him&s;elf; and whether the&s;e labours ought to be called <HI>poor,</HI> or by a better, or a wor&s;e name, every reader will judge for him&s;elf. They have, however, I think, given me opportunity further to explain and vindicate an important truth, which tends to exalt the character of the adorable Je&s;us, and aba&s;e the &s;inner.</P>
<P>Who the&s;e worthy, aged, <HI>trembling</HI> fathers are I know not, and have no inclination to detract from their prai&s;e. But I think I have a right to &s;ay <HI>they fear, where no fear is;</HI> and if they <HI>tremble,</HI> and handle the ark as Mr. M. has done, no thanks are due to them, that it has not been compleatly over&s;et long ago.</P>

<P>WHEREIN it is enquired, Whether God has given any commands to unregenerate &s;inners, which they do truly comply with and may perfectly obey, while unre|generate?</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>THE que&s;tion particularly &s;tated; and arguments offered to prove the negative.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE que&s;tion is not, Whether any commands are given to the unregenerate? Or whether any thing is required of them, which it is their duty to comply with and perform? The unregenerate, it is granted, are under law, as much as the regenerate, and the former are required to be perfectly holy, as much as the latter, and are forbidden everything which is contrary to this. In a word, no duty is required of the regenerate, which the unregenerate are not al&s;o commanded to do. This may be true con&s;i&s;tently with their doing no part of their duty, and living in perfect rebellion again&s;t every command, while un|regenerate. And indeed, they who take the po&s;itive &s;ide of this que&s;|tion, allow that the unregenerate never do in any degree comply with tho&s;e commands which require holine&s;s; for they grant there is no true holine&s;s in any thing which they do. This Mr. M. con&s;tantly allows.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion therefore is, Whether there are any commands given to the unregenerate, which do not require any thing truly holy; but only require &s;uch exerci&s;es and doings which they may and do comply with, and truly perform, according to the true meaning and intent of the commands, while they are perfect enemies to all true holine&s;s?</P>
<P>Mr. M. has zealou&s;ly e&s;pou&s;ed the affirmative &s;ide of this que&s;tion; and great part of his book is taken up in attempting to prove that God requires duties of the unregenerate, which they are to do, and may and do perform while in an unregenerate &s;tate. He owns that I have not expre&s;sly denied that there are any &s;uch duties required of the unrege|nerate; but he has taken con&s;iderable pains to &s;hew why there is rea|&s;on to &s;u&s;pect and even conclude that I held to no &s;uch duties. I am ready to own the charge; and &s;hall proceed to produce the arguments I have for the negative.</P>
<P N="1">I. ACCORDING to our Saviour's account of the divine law or com|mandment, it requires nothing but love to God and our neighbour.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. XXII. 37&mdash;39.</NOTE>
<PB N="117" REF="011295_0062_0F869F0C38B7CA68">
And he expre&s;sly &s;ays that "on the&s;e two commandments hang all the law and the prophets."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">v. 40.</NOTE> That is, all that is required in the law and in the prophets, every injunction and command to be found in divine re|velation, really requires nothing but love to God and our neighbour; l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e exerci&s;ed and expre&s;&s;ed in all proper ways. No other natural and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;en&s;e can be put upon the&s;e words of Chri&s;t. But would they bear another &s;en&s;e, what St. Paul &s;ays on the &s;ame &s;ubject fixes the meaning; of them. He &s;ays "He that loveth another, <HI>hath fulfilled the law.</HI>" And again, "Love is the fulfilling of the law."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. XIII. 8, 10.</NOTE> Love could not be the fulfilling of the law, if the law required any thing more than love, acted out to a perfect degree, and in a proper manner. Love is there|fore the <HI>whole duty of man.</HI> Nothing more nor le&s;s is required. God has not given one precept to man in the law or the prophets, in the old te&s;tament or new, but what requires love to God, or man, or both, and is to be obeyed in the exerci&s;e of love, and no other way, or by nothing el&s;e. There is therefore no <HI>obedience</HI> but what con&s;i&s;ts in love; and where there is nothing of this, there is no duty done; nothing that is required, and is due, is given. This, I conclude is a plain, inconte&s;|tible truth, as demon&s;trably evident as any truth contained in divine revelation; and mu&s;t approve it&s;elf to the rea&s;on of every one who will exerci&s;e his rea&s;on, and not confu&s;e and bewilder him&s;elf with a &s;et of words without a meaning. The unregenerate have no true love to God or their neighbour; for in this, and in the con&s;equent exerci&s;es of en|mity, their unregeneracy con&s;i&s;ts. Therefore they do no duty, obey not one command in the law or the prophets, in the old te&s;tament or new.</P>
<P>IT will be &s;aid doubtle&s;s, they do obey and do duty in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, or at lea&s;t &s;ome part of duty: They do external duties; or that which is the <HI>matter</HI> of duty. The&s;e things, &s;uch as prayer, reading the bible, acts of ju&s;tice and mercy, &amp;c. are commanded duties; and they who do the&s;e things, &s;o far obey the command, and do their duty.</P>
<P>ANS. Nothing is either duty or &s;in, if con&s;idered without any re&s;pect to the heart, and as not implying any exerci&s;es of that: Therefore there is not really any external duty or &s;in, which is not con&s;idered in connexion with exerci&s;es of heart, and as the fruit and expre&s;&s;ion of the&s;e. If a &s;tatue is formed &s;o as by the motion of certain &s;prings to &s;peak di&s;tinct words and pronounce a well compo&s;ed prayer, none will imagine there is any duty done, or any part of duty, any more than in the noi&s;e of a cataract or in the whi&s;tling of the wind. Such a &s;tatue is not a &s;ubject of command, and is not capable of any part of duty. And man is not the &s;ubject of command, or capable of any duty or &s;in in any other view, but in that of a voluntary agent: and all the exter|nal motions, and effects produced by him, which are not in any degree voluntary, are no more duty nor &s;in, and no more any part of either, than if there was no &s;uch thing as duty or &s;in in nature. If a man kills another by a motion or &s;troke, in which he had no de&s;ign, and is per|fectly involuntary, there is no more &s;in in this than there is in the fall|ing of a tree on a man that kills him. And in this ca&s;e to &s;ay, that
<PB N="118" REF="011295_0063_0F869F0D12D36D70">
the man, or the tree is guilty of external &s;in, or has done the matter of &s;in, and &s;o has really &s;inned, and done what was forbidden, would ju&s;tly be reckoned a high degree of ab&s;urdity and non&s;en&s;e. But this would be as proper language, as to &s;peak of a per&s;on's doing external duty or the <HI>matter</HI> of his duty, as tho' &s;ome duty was really done with|out taking into view the exerci&s;es of his will in the affair, and not con&s;idering him as a voluntary agent. But if he is con&s;idered as a vo|luntary agent, and the whole of the duty lies in the exerci&s;es of the heart or will; then what is done is either duty or &s;in, according as the&s;e are. If one man kills another by a voluntary execution or motion, in which he had a prudent de&s;ign &amp; de&s;ire to &s;ave his life, the action is so far from being &s;in or murder, that it is an act of kindne&s;s and mercy. The man committed no &s;in, but did his duty. If a man pronounces the words of a prayer, without one thought or voluntary exerci&s;e about it, he does no more duty than the &s;tatue ju&s;t mentioned, or the tree that bows before the moving air. But if he does this voluntarily, with tho't and de&s;ign, and his will and de&s;ign herein is perfectly bad, and the &s;ame with his, who cur&s;es and bla&s;phemes the name of God, &s;uch vo|luntarine&s;s, &s;uch exerci&s;es and de&s;ign &s;urely do not render exter|nal action duty, which would not be &s;o in it&s;elf con&s;idered. If the exter|nal action was neither duty nor &s;in, con&s;idered as unconnected with any de&s;ign or will, it does not become duty by being con&s;idered in connection with &s;inful volitions, and as the fruit of them, but on the contrary, the whole taken together, is &s;in, and nothing but &s;in.</P>
<P>If it is well attended to, it will appear I conclude, that there is a great impropriety and gro&s;s ab&s;urdity in &s;peaking of a man's doing any part of his duty in his external conduct, when this conduct is not con&s;idered as the fruit and expre&s;&s;ion of his heart, or any way connected with it; but more e&s;pecially when it is con&s;idered as the fruit of wrong and &s;inful exerci&s;es of heart. And to u&s;e &s;uch language in this ca&s;e, and talk of doing duty in part and &s;ome degree in external con|duct, by &s;eparating it from all views and exerci&s;es of the mind, is u&s;ing words with at any con&s;i&s;tent ideas, and only tends to blind and confu&s;e the minds of tho&s;e who &s;uffer them&s;elves to be impo&s;ed upon by &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions. The externals of devotion and religion are the proper and appointed ways of our acting out and expre&s;&s;ing our love to God: and in this view may be called the external part, or matter of duty; hence they have obtained the name of <HI>duties:</HI> But when there is really no love to God exerci&s;ed and expre&s;&s;ed in the&s;e externals, there is no duty in them; they cea&s;e to be any part of duty. And if the&s;e externals are attended upon in the exerci&s;e of perfect enmity again&s;t God, and as the fruit and expre&s;&s;ion of that, it is &s;omething far wor&s;e. But be|cau&s;e the former have obtained the name of duties, being the proper and appointed ways of acting out and expre&s;&s;ing re&s;pect and love to God, many have bewildered them&s;elves by the word <HI>duty,</HI> and have been led to think and &s;peak of the&s;e externals as duties, con&s;idered in them|&s;elves, and the attendance on them as doing duty, and have in this way impo&s;ed on them&s;elves and others. The&s;e things are not required,
<PB N="119" REF="011295_0063_0F869F0D12D36D70">
for their own &s;akes, or in them&s;elves con&s;idered, but only as proper ways of exerci&s;ing and expre&s;&s;ing love to God. Love to God is there|fore the thing required, the whole of the duty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in this, and where this is wanting the externals are as to duty an empty nothing, not the thing required; and in doing them, no duty is done.</P>
<P>In this view of the matter we may &s;ee the true meaning of what God &s;ays to the people or I&s;rael, "When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand to tread my courts?"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. I. 12.</NOTE> The&s;e things were required, but not for their own &s;ake, but only as an expre&s;&s;ion of their re&s;pect and love to God. Therefore when this cea&s;ed to be ex|erci&s;ed and expre&s;&s;ed, and they appeared not to have the love of God, but the contrary, their attendance on the&s;e externals, was not doing any thing that was required of them. There things were not required of them, as they performed them: Therefore in their attendance on them they really did nothing that was required of them, and &s;o did not the lea&s;t part of their duty. To the &s;ame purpo&s;e is what God &s;ays by Jeremiah, "I &s;pake not to your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings and &s;acrifices: But this thing commanded I them, &s;aying, Obey my voice,"<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Jer. VII. 22, 23.</NOTE> Burnt offerings and &s;acrifices and all other externals were not required merely as &s;uch, or con&s;idered by them&s;elves as mere externals; as &s;uch God did not command them; but as the expre&s;&s;ion of love and obedience. Therefore when the&s;e were attended upon, without the exerci&s;e of love and obedience, the thing which God re|&s;pected in his command and even the whole that was commanded, was neglected, and no duty done.</P>
<P>None will &s;uppo&s;e, I pre&s;ume, that the devils did any duty when they cried out &s;aying "Thou a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t Chri&s;t the Son of God."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luk. IV. 41.</NOTE> Or when the chief devil in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed man prayed to Chri&s;t in the name of the re&s;t, in the mo&s;t earne&s;t manner, "I be&s;eech thee torment me not."<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Luk. VIII. 28.</NOTE> But the defect was not in externals, but in the want of love to Chri&s;t, and the exerci&s;e of enmity again&s;t him. And will any one imagine that men who have no more love or true re&s;pect to God than the devils, and are as real and entire enemies to him as they, which is the cha|racter of all the unregenerate; that &s;uch, I &s;ay, do any more duty in their external words and actions, than the devils did in the in&s;tances mentioned? What do &s;uch men do, which the devils did not? If the want of love to Chri&s;t and enmity again&s;t him in the latter rendered all they did in openly confe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;t to be the Son of God, and praying to him, not duty, but &s;in; why is not this as true of the former?</P>
<P>If a man does ju&s;tice in his dealings, without any de&s;ign or de&s;ire to do ju&s;tice he does no more duty than the ju&s;t balance which gives to every one his due. And if one gives to the poor without de&s;ign, and good will, he does no more of the duty of &s;hewing mercy, than the fruitful tree from which the poor is fed. And whatever external acts of kindne&s;s and charity he does, if he means not &s;o, and has not the lea&s;t degree of love and good will to his fellow men in his heart, he
<PB N="120" REF="011295_0064_0F869F0DD87EC850">
certainly pays no true regard and obedience to the command to &s;hew mercy, and does no part of this duty. And if, contrary to this, his heart it full of malevolence and ill-will to his neighbours, and he in|tends &s;ome evil to them by his external appearance of love and kind|ne&s;s, he is &s;o far from doing any duty, that the&s;e external acts, con&s;i|dered at his acts (and they are no acts at all in any other view) are as really a violation of his duty, and acts of melevolence and &s;in, as are &s;tealing from his neighbour, and attempting to cut his throat.</P>
<P>To him, who will well con&s;ider the&s;e things, I think, it mu&s;t appear, that to talk of doing the external and <HI>material</HI> part of duty, under the notion that this is really doing <HI>any</HI> duty and obeying God's commands, without any regard had to the mind, or while that is &s;upp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed to be directly contrary to all duty, is very ab&s;urd, and tends to confu&s;e and deceive all tho&s;e, who will be confu&s;ed and deceived by a &s;et of un|meaning words and phra&s;es; and that where there is no love to God or men exerci&s;ed, there is no duty done, whatever is the external ap|pearance and conduct.</P>
<P>IT is &s;till &s;aid by &s;ome that tho' it is granted, as it mu&s;t be, that ex|ternal words and actions cannot be con&s;idered as any part of duty, or as having any thing of the nature of duty, unle&s;s they are viewed as the voluntary exerci&s;es of a moral agent, by which he acts out and ex|pre&s;&s;es his heart; and therefore if the principles and exerci&s;es of his heart are all wrong and &s;inful, no duty is done, but all is &s;in; yet it does not follow that the unregenerate do no duty: They may obey the divine command, from the natural principles which they have, &s;uch as <HI>natural con&s;cience</HI> and <HI>&s;elf-love.</HI> The&s;e, tho' they are not the be&s;t principles, yet are good, or at lea&s;t not &s;inful; and God requires the unregenerate to improve the&s;e, and act from &s;uch principles as they have; and when they do &s;o, this is real obedience, and they do their duty, even what God commands.</P>
<P>ANS. 1. There is no love to God or our neighbour in the exerci&s;e of the&s;e natural principles, or while men act from them only: it there|fore follows from what has been already proved, that there is no obe|dience in this, becau&s;e all obedience con&s;i&s;ts in love to God and our neighbour. At lea&s;t it mu&s;t be allowed to be proved, till it can be &s;hewn wherein the argument fails.</P>
<P>ANS. 2. But if this argument is laid a&s;ide, and what is here advanc|ed is attended to, it may be proved to be groundle&s;s, and very ab&s;urd. The&s;e natural principles are not principles of obedience; nor is there any obedience meerly in acting from them. If the dictates of natural con&s;cience are not according to the truth, but directly contrary to what is truth and duty, none will think, I conclude, that a man does his duty in acting according to &s;uch dictates: for this is the &s;ame as to &s;ay that a man does his duty in acting directly contrary to his duty. Will any one &s;ay, that <HI>Saul</HI> did his duty, and obeyed Chri&s;t in per&s;ecut|ing the church, becau&s;e he acted according to the dictates of his con|&s;cience, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ily thought he ought to do it? If &s;o, the more &s;tupid
<PB N="121" REF="011295_0064_0F869F0DD87EC850">
and blind men are to duty, and the more contrary their hearts are to it, as the ground and rea&s;on of their &s;tupidity and blindne&s;s, the more obedient and dutiful they are. If the dictates of con&s;cience are ac|cording to the truth, and point out what is duty, they declare that this con&s;i&s;ts in love to God and our neighbour: That this is their immedi|ate duty and all that is required. If therefore, they continue not to love God &amp; their neighbour, they are &s;o far from obeying the dictates of con|&s;cience, that they go in direct oppo&s;ition to the&s;e, &amp; &s;o are very far from doing their duty. But, to &s;ay the truth, natural con&s;cience it neither a principle of obedience, nor of di&s;obedience, as has been before ob&s;erved. There is but one principle of obedience, which is love, or di&s;intere&s;ted re&s;pect or regard to God, &amp; our neighbour. Whatever regard is paid to the dictates of con&s;cience from any other principle, there is no obe|dience in it; and the greate&s;t enemy to God and his neighbour, may exerci&s;e as much of this &s;ort of obedience as any other man.</P>
<P>And as to <HI>&s;elf-love:</HI> If by it is meant only a love and de&s;ire of hap|pine&s;s; this is the principle of all actions in general, whether they be rebellion again&s;t God, or obedience. It is e&s;&s;ential to all voluntary a|gents, and is the principle of all the &s;in in the univer&s;e, as much as of holine&s;s and obedience. If by &s;elf-love is meant <HI>&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s,</HI> or a per|&s;on's having re&s;pect to him&s;elf only, and to nothing el&s;e, either God or his neighbour; placing his happine&s;s in his own private intere&s;t, as di&s;tinct from all other beings, de&s;iring and pur&s;uing this happine&s;s and nothing el&s;e; this is &s;o far from being a principle of obedience, that it is the principle of all the di&s;obedience and &s;in, that ever was, or will be in the creation; and in direct and mo&s;t perfect oppo&s;ition to love to God and our neighbour. How ab&s;urd then is it to talk of obeying God, and doing duty from a principle of &s;elf love!</P>
<P>OBJ. But a well regulated &s;elf-love is rea&s;onable and right. Per|&s;ons ought to &s;eek their own happine&s;s, if it be true happine&s;s, and if they &s;eek it where it is to had, and place it in right and proper objects, and with a proper &s;ubordination to the glory of God and the general good. How then can this be &s;in and rebellion? If it is right and rea&s;onable, men <HI>ought</HI> to exerci&s;e it, and this is their duty, and the contrary is &s;in.</P>
<P>ANS. 1. There is no &s;uch thing as a well regulated &s;elf-love, if by &s;elf-love be meant, what has been ju&s;t de&s;cribed. Selfi&s;hne&s;s ought not to take place in the lea&s;t degree; it is in every degree unrea&s;onable and rebellion again&s;t God. A well regulated &s;elf love is quite a dif|ferent thing from &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and in direct oppo&s;ition to it. It con|&s;i&s;ts in placing our happine&s;s in the glory of God and the good of our neighbour, and regarding our intere&s;t only as included in the intere&s;t of the whole, or the greate&s;t good of being in general, and not &s;ome|thing di&s;tinct and &s;eparate from it; which is &s;o far from &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, that, it is directly oppo&s;ite to it, even di&s;intere&s;ted benevolence to be|ing general.</P>
<P>ANS. 2. No per&s;on under the influence of that &s;elf-love which has re&s;pect to him&s;elf wholly, and to no other being, is &s;eeking after true
<PB N="122" REF="011295_0065_0F869F0E835499A0">
happine&s;s, or places it where he ought. True happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in the enjoyment of God in the exerci&s;e of love to being in general; but by the &s;uppo&s;ition the &s;elfi&s;h man does not &s;eek this happine&s;s, for he has no true re&s;pect to God, or any other being but him&s;elf. And there is no more obedience in &s;eeking future happine&s;s in a &s;elfi&s;h way, or without any re&s;pect and regard to the intere&s;t of any other being, than there is in &s;eeking happine&s;s in this pre&s;ent world, in any way, and in any objects whatever.</P>
<P>ANS. 3. It is mo&s;t ab&s;urd and a gro&s;s contradiction, to talk of &s;elf love or &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s &s;ubordinated to the glory of God, and the general good: for &s;elf-love has no regard to God or any other being but &s;elf; and is &s;o far from being &s;ubordinated to the glory of God, and the ge|neral good, that it is an enemy to the general good; and in its own nature enmity it&s;elf again&s;t being in general. The man under the influence and dominion of &s;elf-love, regards and &s;eeks him&s;elf only; and the language of his heart is, "I care not what becomes of the glory of God and the general good, if my own ends may be an&s;wered." And how can this principle be &s;ubordinated to the general good? Will it &s;ubmit and &s;ubordinate it&s;elf to this? That is to &s;uppo&s;e that it will change its own nature, and no longer &s;eek &s;elf wholly, but the general good more than &s;elf, and as the highe&s;t and be&s;t end. And what can be more &s;elf-contradictory and ab&s;urd than this!</P>
<P N="2">II. THO' the &s;hort and plain argument that has been con&s;idered, is quite &s;ufficient, I think, to end the di&s;pute, and prove that there are no commanded duties which the unregenerate fulfil, or comply with in the lea&s;t degree; yet it may be proper to mention &s;ome other arguments, which prove the &s;ame thing, as they may &s;erve to &s;trengthen the former, with &s;ome at lea&s;t, and &s;et the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty of the contrary doctrine, if po&s;&s;ible, in yet a clearer and more &s;triking light.</P>
<P>Therefore I proceed to &s;ay,</P>
<P>All God's commands to his creatures are an expre&s;&s;ion of his will or heart, which is the &s;ame with their being a tran&s;cript of his moral per|fection, as the common phra&s;e is. But God's moral perfection is his holine&s;s: and his will is holy. Therefore whatever command is an expre&s;&s;ion of his will, mu&s;t require holine&s;s. That which requires any thing el&s;e, is no expre&s;&s;ion of his moral perfection; therefore cannot be the expre&s;&s;ion of the will of God, and &s;o cannot be his command.</P>
<P N="3">III. DUTY to God always &s;uppo&s;es and implies &s;omething given to God, and done for him, out of regard and re&s;pect to him. But where there is no true love to God, there is no true re&s;pect paid to him; no|thing is offered to him or done for him in the intention and de&s;ign of the doer. Therefore there is really no duty done. Nothing that is due to God is given; and &s;o no command that he can give is obeyed.</P>
<P N="4">IV. If God &s;hould command the unregenerate to do any thing, as &s;uch, and which they may do con&s;i&s;tently with their having no love to him, and being under the power of perfect and reigning enmity again&s;t him; this is in &s;ome degree, if not wholly giving up his demands on
<PB N="123" REF="011295_0065_0F869F0E835499A0">
them which require them to love him, to repent, and embrace the go&s;|pel. Such a notion &s;eems to ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> it and &s;uppo&s;e, that there higher demands are hard and &s;evere, and not &s;uitable to be made on the unre|generate, God therefore does not in&s;i&s;t on them, but comes down, and conforms to their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and inclination, and tells then, if they are not inclined to re&s;pect and embrace the go&s;pel, he will point out &s;ome|thing for them to do, which is agreeable to their hearts, and which they may be inclined to do while perfect enemies to him. And is not this coming down, and conforming to the will and perfectly wicked inclination of the &s;inner in a manner infinitely unbecoming the mo&s;t high God?</P>
<P>Mr. M. very ju&s;tly ob&s;erves "that God don't make the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d will of the creature the rule of his duty."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 52.</NOTE> This, I think is giving up the point entirely. If God does <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> accomodate his laws and com|mands to the depraved will of the creature, he has appointed no duties to be done, which imply no re&s;pect to him, becau&s;e their wills <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> depraved, that they have no re&s;pect and love; but are perfect enemies to him. If mans will was perfectly right, there would certainly be no occa&s;ion or rea&s;on for any &s;uch commands. Therefore if God gives &s;uch it is purely out of regard to their depraved will, as the &s;ole rule and rea&s;on of the command. Were they di&s;po&s;ed to love God with all their heart, he would not give any command that could be obeyed without love to him: But &s;ince they have no love to him, he love's his demand, and appoints a rule of duty, &s;uited to their hearts or wills, which have no love, but are perfectly oppo&s;ite to him. And is not this to make the depraved will of the creature the rule of his duty? And is not &s;uch a notion very di&s;honorable to God; and in effect to give up all moral government, by making the will of the creature, and not the will and law of the creator, the guide and rule?</P>
<P>If a prince &s;hould treat his rebellious &s;ubjects &s;o, who refu&s;ed to lay down their arms and &s;ubmit to him, and pay him any re&s;pect; would he not act a di&s;honorable part, and give up his own character &amp; govern|ment, in a mea&s;ure at lea&s;t in favor of his avowed enemies and rebelli|ous &s;ubjects? Should he, for in&s;tance, when he came among them, and called upon them to return immediately to their allegiance and &s;ubmit to him; and found that they were &s;o far from obeying, that this de|mand rou&s;ed them all to arms, and they &s;tood with drawn &s;words point|ed directly at him, ob&s;tinately refu&s;ing to yield one point to him, or &s;ubmit in the lea&s;t degree: Should he, I &s;ay, in&s;tead of in&s;i&s;ting on his former demand, tell them that he found they were ob&s;tinately fixed in rebellion again&s;t him; he would therefore propo&s;e &s;omething to them and require it of them, which they might do and yet continue rebels, and oppo&s;e and fight again&s;t him and his government as much as ever, viz. to draw up a petition to him th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> he would pardon them and de|liver them from the mi&s;aries that their rebellion had brought upon them; which they might make and read over every day, con&s;i&s;tently with continuing in a &s;tate of rebellion, and without making any pre|tences to the contrary; or if they did, they would be only pretence
<PB N="124" REF="011295_0066_0F869F0F5712BD00">
and profe&s;&s;ion directly contrary to the truth: And that if they would do this he would look upon them as in &s;ome mea&s;ure loyal, dutiful &s;ub|jects, or as doing &s;ome part of their duty: would not this be giving up his fir&s;t demand, at lea&s;t in &s;ome degree; and be implicitly granting that they were not wholly to blame for not immediately &s;ubmitting to him?</P>
<P>If a prince &s;hould conduct &s;o, all who were friends to his character and government would be grieved, and view him as injuring both; and in a degree giving them up in favor of rebels. I &s;uppo&s;e this will be a clear ca&s;e to all. And I &s;ee not why the ca&s;e before us is not as clear; ye much more &s;o, in proportion to the greater dignity and wor|thine&s;s of the mo&s;t high God, and the proportionable inexcu&s;able wickedne&s;s of the &s;inner. And the only rea&s;on, I conceive, why any have run into this notion of God's appointing duties to the unregene|rate, to be done by them while &s;uch, and have not been rather &s;hocked at it, is that they look on them as in &s;ome mea&s;ure at lea&s;t excu&s;able for not loving God and embracing the go&s;pel, this being above their power, and what they <HI>cannot</HI> do while unregenerate; altho' (poor crea|tures!) they are quite willing and de&s;irous to do what they <HI>can.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. IF God commands the unregenerate to do that which they may do in a &s;tate of rebellion, and while they are with all their hearts op|po&s;ing him, and in the exerci&s;e of perfect enmity again&s;t him, I &s;ee not why this is not commanding &s;in and rebellion, and making this their duty. It mu&s;t be &s;o, if all they do is &s;in and rebellion, which, I think is certain to a demon&s;tration; for in the exerci&s;es of a moral agent there is, there can be, no medium between holine&s;s and &s;in. It will be &s;aid here, that God doth not command the &s;in, but the duty. I an&s;wer, take away the &s;in, and &s;eparate it from every thing el&s;e, and there remains nothing in which there is any moral agency, and &s;o no|thing in which there is either &s;in or duty; and therefore nothing which can be the &s;ubject of command. Con&s;equently if the &s;in is not com|manded, nothing is commanded.</P>
<P>Mr. M. has made &s;everal attempts to an&s;wer this argument, which may mo&s;t properly be con&s;idered here. He &s;ays, <Q>The mi&s;take on which this objection is founded, is a &s;uppo&s;ition that there is a na|tural connexion between requiring the unregenerate to pray, and requiring them to &s;in: Whereas the connexion is intirely of a moral nature, and ari&s;es merely from a moral cau&s;e, the creature's want of moral ability, or which is the &s;ame, his want of di&s;po&s;ition of heart, and inclination of will &s;incerely to comply with the command, which is merely the creature's fault. And &s;hall this fault of the creature be attributed to God's command, requiring what is &s;trictly the crea|ture's duty?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 94.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Upon this the following things may be ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>l. There is indeed a natural connexion between requring the unre|generate to pray as &s;uch, as wholly wicked and oppo&s;ite to God in all the exerci&s;es of their hearts that re&s;pect him, and requiring them to &s;in; for the&s;e are preci&s;ely one and the &s;ame thing, and the di&s;tinction be|tween
<PB N="125" REF="011295_0066_0F869F0F5712BD00">
moral and natural here, is quite unintelligible and to no purpo&s;e. If the prayers of the wicked are an abomination to the Lord, i. e. wholly &s;inful, then to require them to make <HI>&s;uch prayers,</HI> is for God to require them to do what is an abomination to him, and wholly &s;inful. And this is the &s;ame, I think, as to command them to &s;in. If God requires the wicked to pray, as &s;uch, in the exerci&s;e of their wicked inclination of heart, and without any other or better inclination, what he requires is &s;in; and its being wholly their own fault that they are thus inclined, and do &s;in, as they are commanded, is &s;o far from rendering the thing commanded no &s;in, that it is the only rea&s;on why it is &s;in; for if it was not their fault, it would not be &s;in.</P>
<P N="2">2. If Mr. M. had con&s;tantly kept this mind, that it is wholly man's fault that he is not holy, and really believed it in all its length and breadth, he would never have thought of their being commanded to do unholy duties: for if it is their immediate and indi&s;pen&s;ible duty to be holy and embrace the go&s;pel, no rea&s;on can be given why this &s;hould not be required of them immediately; or why any thing le&s;s or lower than this, even unholy duties, &s;hould be required at all. Mr. M. thro' a great part of his book goes on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the un|regenerate are not wholly to blame for not embracing the go&s;pel, and doing holy duties: had he not &s;uppo&s;ed this, we never &s;hould have heard of his unregenerate duties, and of their hone&s;t attempts, and do|ing their utmo&s;t in the exerci&s;e of &s;uch principles as they have, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">3. Mr. M. does fully yield the point to the objector in what he &s;ays here. According to his own conce&s;&s;ion, God's command has no re|&s;pect to the fault of the creature; but requires what is &s;trictly his duty. Surely then he requires holine&s;s; for this is "&s;trictly his duty;" and every thing &s;hort of this is the creature's fault. If God commands men to do duties, without any regard to their moral deficiency, which is wholly their own fault, or making any allowance for it; then in his commands he makes no allowance for their unregeneracy; for this is a moral defect, and wholly their own fault: and therefore does not re|quire unregenerate, unholy duties. It appears therefore that Mr. M. had no other way to an&s;wer the objection, but by giving up what was objected again&s;t, and granting that no unregenerate duties, nothing unholy and impure is required, but real holine&s;s, which is in all ca&s;es "&s;trictly the creature's duty."</P>
<P>But let us attend to the &s;imilitude he brings to illu&s;trate this matter. <Q>To make this mi&s;take plain to the meane&s;t capacity, &s;uppo&s;e a father correcting his &s;on for di&s;obedient rebellious behaviour, &s;hould in the clo&s;e, require him to bow his head, in token of reverence and &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to his parental authority: the &s;on, thro' un&s;ubdued per|ver&s;ene&s;s of temper, bows in hypocri&s;y. Does the father by com|manding the duty, command the &s;in? Far be it. And much le&s;s in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>I think he has by this &s;imilitude "made it plain to the meane&s;t capa|city" that he has entirely given up his cau&s;e, and expre&s;sly a&s;&s;erts the contrary, viz, that God does not require what &s;inners do while under
<PB N="126" REF="011295_0067_0F869F0FFAFC2C88">
the dominion of "un&s;ubdued perver&s;ene&s;s." If the father requires the &s;on to bow his head, "in token of reverence and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his pa|rental authority," and in no other way; the &s;on does not obey this command in the lea&s;t degree; therefore does no duty, nothing that the father commands: but his bowing his head in hypocri&s;y in the exerci&s;e of un&s;ubdued perver&s;ene&s;s is &s;o far from being an act of obedience, that it is an exerci&s;e and act of high rebellion, and only &s;erves to offend and provoke the father; as it is a daring attempt to impo&s;e upon him and mock him. Does Mr M. think, and will he &s;ay, that acts of gro&s;s hypocri&s;y, in the exerci&s;e of "un&s;ubdued perver&s;ene&s;s," are the crea|tures duty, and acts of obedience, and that God commands the&s;e? And that the&s;e are le&s;s &s;inful and more acceptable in God's fight than the neglect of them? This is a very ill cho&s;en &s;imilitude for Mr. M. and will, I doubt not, make it "plain to the meane&s;t capacity," that his notion of unregenerate duties is very ab&s;urd, and that he here a&s;&s;erts that &s;uch are not required; but that God in all ca&s;es requires &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion to him, and proper tokens and expre&s;&s;ions of this, and nothing el&s;e.</P>
<P>And by the way, I de&s;ire it may be con&s;idered, whether the &s;on who under the father's correction and reproofs, continues in the exerci&s;e of "un&s;ubdued perver&s;ene&s;s," and bows his head in hypocri&s;y, is not more guilty and vile than he was before his father took him in hand. lf &s;o, which I conclude Mr. M. him&s;elf will allow; then he has by bringing this in&s;tance to repre&s;ent the ca&s;e of the unregenerate, not only given up the point he brought it to &s;upport; but al&s;o mu&s;t allow that they do not become le&s;s &s;inful; but more guilty and vile in the u&s;e of means, while they per&s;i&s;t in their "un&s;ubdued perver&s;ene&s;s," under all the light and conviction they have: and &s;o has here really given up the whole which he undertook to &s;upport. Had Mr. M. con&s;tantly viewed the unregenerate in the light in which he &s;ets them here, my &s;ection on means. could not have given him &s;uch great offence.</P>
<P>BUT let us &s;ee if he has &s;ucceeded any better in his other attempt to an&s;wer this objection. He &s;ays the &s;in the unregenerate are guilty of in what they do, <Q>is no part of the duty, as required by God, don't be|long to its e&s;&s;ence; but ari&s;es from man's deficiency. God has a right to require of his people <HI>good duties.</HI> When he puts them un+der go&s;pel advantages, &amp;c. he requires <HI>go&s;pel holine&s;s.</HI> A prevalent indi&s;po&s;ition of heart, and di&s;inclination of will to <HI>do right,</HI> makes no abatement in God's demands of us: or in the duty we owe to God.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 115.</NOTE></Q> Here again he expre&s;sly gives up the whole, and a&s;&s;erts that what God requires is <HI>good duties, go&s;pel holine&s;s;</HI> and not unrege|nerate duties. Thus he &s;hifts, gives up his cau&s;e, and turns again&s;t him&s;elf. He labours abundantly, to prove that God requires of the unregenerate &s;omething which is not holine&s;s but tho&s;e doings which they may perform with "un&s;ubdued perver&s;ene&s;s" of heart. And when he is told that that is to require that which is &s;in; he turns about and &s;ays God requires nothing but "good duties, go&s;pel holine&s;s;" and &s;o gets rid of the objection by un&s;aying all he had &s;o often and zealou&s;ly a&s;&s;erted before, again&s;t which the objection yet remains in its full force.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="011295_0067_0F869F0FFAFC2C88">But he goes on, <Q>Thus &s;tands the ca&s;e; God puts his covenant peo|ple under advantages to bring forth <HI>good fruits,</HI> and then he has a ju&s;t right, expects and demands them. God requires <HI>good duties</HI> of his people; both the performance and the goodne&s;s or the duty is ab&s;olutely required: And therefore God will have the duties or per|formances, tho' thro' their badne&s;s they come mar'd out of their hands. Does God in requiring these duties, require their being mar'd?

<P>ANS. 1. Our Saviour does not direct the Jews to &s;earch the &s;criptures with all their prejudices, and in the exerci&s;e of enmity again&s;t him; and with a de&s;ire and de&s;ign to prove from them that he was an im|po&s;tor. This I tru&s;t neither Mr. M. nor any one el&s;e will a&s;&s;ert, or allow. But there is ju&s;t as much evidence that he directed them to &s;earch the &s;criptures thus, as there is that he directed them to do it, as enemies to his character and doctrines. They ought to have &s;earched the &s;criptures with a heart ready to embrace and practice the truth, whatever they found it to be; and therefore our Saviour doubtle&s;s in|joins this on them; which he knew they would not do &s;o long as they continued to hate both him and the Father that &s;ent him. Chri&s;t told them that, "If any man will do his will (i. e. is di&s;po&s;ed and inclined to do the will of God) he &s;hall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I &s;peak of my&s;elf."<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Joh. VII. 17.</NOTE> And when he tells them to &s;earch the &s;cripture in order to determine this, he directs them to do it with &s;uch an inclination; and not with a di&s;po&s;ition directly oppo&s;ite to that which was nece&s;&s;ary in order to an&s;wer the end propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Mr. M. ob&s;erves that Chri&s;t directs them to &s;earch the &s;criptures, "as a means in order to come to the knowledge of him as Mediator." This is granted: but it does not follow that he enjoins them to do this with a wicked heart; but with a right temper and di&s;po&s;ition of mind: for the latter was nece&s;&s;ary in order to come to the true knowledge of Chri&s;t as Mediator. And, as has been ob&s;erved, it was their indi&s;|pen&s;ible duty, as well as intere&s;t to &s;earch the &s;criptures with &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition of mind.</P>
<P>ANS. 2. The word in the original, tran&s;lated <HI>&s;earch,</HI> in the impera|tive mood, may be as well rendered <HI>ye do &s;earch.</HI> It is thus tran&s;lated by mo&s;t of the noted critics on the orginal.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vid. Pol. Syn. in locum.</NOTE> And this tran&s;lation is thought to be confirmed by the following ver&s;e; the &s;en&s;e of the two ver&s;es being this, "Ye take much pains to &s;earch the &s;criptures, becau&s;e ye think ye have eternal life in them. This is very true, and I am the life here revealed; and yet &s;o perver&s;e and blind are you, that while ye are paying &s;uch great regard to the &s;criptures, ye reject me, and will not come to me that ye may have the life there revealed."</P>
<P>ANS. 3. When Chri&s;t directs and commands to &s;eek fir&s;t the king|dom of God, &amp;c. and labor for the meat that endures to everla&s;ting life, he doubtle&s;s directs to that &s;eeking and labor by which men will certainly obtain what they &s;eek and labor after. There is certainly not the lea&s;t evidence that he does not; or that by &s;eeking and lobor|ing he means any exerci&s;es and doings of men unregenerate. I &s;ee not why Mr. M. might not with as much propriety and rea&s;on have quoted every direction and command of our Saviour that is recorded, as requiring unregenerate doings, and nothing but &s;uch.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="011295_0068_0F869F15F372DE30">And it is to be particularly ob&s;erved that there is an expre&s;s promi&s;e made to them who &s;eek fir&s;t the kingdom of God and his righteou&s;ne&s;s, "All the&s;e things &s;hall be added unto you."

<P>Mr. M. proceeds, "And is not the &s;inner that finds the pearl, plain|ly repre&s;ented as being a &s;eeker, previous to his finding it?"<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Mat. XIII. 45, 46.</NOTE></P>
<P>ANS. 1. If it is granted that the unregenerate &s;inner <HI>&s;eeks</HI> after Chri&s;t and &s;alvation, this is not to the purpo&s;e; for he may do this, and yet obey no command, nor do any duty. How then came Mr. M. to think that this was in the lea&s;t to the point he was upon?</P>
<P>ANS. 2. The merchant &s;eeking goodly pearls is not de&s;igned to re|pre&s;ent a man unregenerate but one who is as much prepared in the temper of his mind, as much di&s;po&s;ed to embrace Je&s;us Chri&s;t as his only Savior and Portion, as the greedy merchant is to prize and purcha&s;e a precious pearl. And who can this be but a per&s;on re|generate? All that Chri&s;t means to repre&s;ent by this &s;imilitude is, the temper and exerci&s;es with which men embrace him and become mem|bers of his kingdom, or, in his language, receive the kingdom of God. They love and prize him &s;o as to for&s;ake all for him. On the whole then, Mr. M. has proved nothing by producing this text, unle&s;s it be, that he looks on the unregenerate, not as enemies to Chri&s;t, but as being as much di&s;po&s;ed to embrace Chri&s;t and part with all for him, as is the merchant, who is in pur&s;uit of pearls, to part with his whole e&s;tate to purcha&s;e a pearl of great price: a notion which he has kept in view thro' his whole book, and on which it is in a mea&s;ure all built, as has been ob&s;erved, however contrary to the whole tenor of &s;cripture.</P>
<P>THE next pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture Mr. M. produces in the following words, <Q>And does not God complain of his people, that <HI>they will not frame their doings to turn unto their God?</HI><NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Mo&s;. V. 4.</NOTE> Sure this mu&s;t be &s;ome|thing previous to a &s;aving repentance, and &s;omething that God re|quired; otherwi&s;e they had not been blamed for the neglect of it; for where there is no law, there is no tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P>ANS. 1. The Hebrew word here tran&s;lated <HI>frame</HI> properly &s;ignifies to <HI>give</HI> or <HI>grant,</HI> and is often tran&s;lated to &s;uffer or permit. And the&s;e words may be rendered thus, Their pur&s;uits, or their evil ways, will not &s;uffer them to turn to the Lord. That is, the &s;ins in which they live are in the way of their turning to the Lord, and do with the great|e&s;t &s;trength and ob&s;tinacy oppo&s;e it. This &s;en&s;e agrees well with the following words; "For the &s;pirit of whoredoms is in the mid&s;t of them, and they have not known the Lord." The words &s;et forth their great degree of corruption, by which they were at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from turning to the Lord.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="011295_0069_0F869F1602654418">ANS. 2d. The words as they &s;tand in our tran&s;lation, expre&s;s much the &s;ame thing. The meaning or them is, that they were &s;o far gone in wickedne&s;s, that they had not the lea&s;t di&s;po&s;ition or inclination to turn to the Lord, which is true of every unregenerate per&s;on. And the words do not &s;uppo&s;e that while men continue perfectly wicked, and ob&s;tinate enemies to God, they in any true &s;en&s;e, <HI>from their doings to turn to the Lord;</HI> becau&s;e this is a gro&s;s contradiction, which Mr. M. and all who join with him have run into, by putting &s;uch a &s;en&s;e upon them. Mr. M. therefore had no warrant to &s;ay, "Sure this mu&s;t be &s;omething previous to a &s;aving repentance." On this a&s;&s;ertion all the weight of his argument from the&s;e words re&s;ts; which he has not &s;aid one word to &s;upport. And indeed it could not be &s;upported by him, had he attempted it; for it <HI>&s;urely</HI> re&s;ts on a &s;andy foundation.</P>
<P>Mr. M. goes on, <Q>And does not St Paul clearly point out atten|dance on the word preached as a means in order to faith? So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word preached,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. X. 17.</NOTE></Q> <HI>(by the word of God</HI> it &s;hould be.)</P>
<P>ANS. All that is a&s;&s;erted here is, that it is impo&s;&s;ible that men &s;hould believe that of which they never heard: that the truths to be believed by men in order to &s;alvation are contained in divine revelation, and that none can believe the&s;e, unle&s;s he hears them. It follows from this that hearing or attending to the truths of divine revelation, is nece&s;&s;ary in order to faith in Chri&s;t. But how are they to hear? Not with a di&s;po&s;ition to hate Chri&s;t and all divine truth, as &s;oon as it comes to their notice; but as Cornelius heard St. Peter, with a di&s;po&s;ition and readine&s;s of mind to receive the truth in love, and believe it. This is never done by the unregenerate. No unregenerate duties therefore can be inferred from the&s;e words.</P>
<P>Mr. M. adds, <Q>And does not the apo&s;tle Peter expre&s;sly exhort Si|mon, being unregenerate to pray? Repent therefore of this thy wickedne&s;s, and pray to God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Act. VII. P. 22.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> Repentance is often &s;poken of in the new te&s;tament and old, and per&s;ons are often called upon to repent. And when &s;poken of as connected with forgivene&s;s of &s;ins, and the condition of this, it always has one determinate preci&s;e meaning, even a turning from &s;in to God through Je&s;us Chri&s;t. St. Peter received orders from his ma&s;ter at the la&s;t interview he had with him to preach repentance and remi&s;|&s;ion of &s;ins in his name.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luk. XXIV 47</NOTE> And we find him obeying his orders and &s;ay|ing to a large auditory when waiting on him to know what they had to do, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Act. II. 38.</NOTE> And to another, 'Repent ye there|fore, and be converted, that your &s;ins may be blotted out."<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Acts. III. 19.</NOTE> And we have no account of his, or of any of the re&s;t of the apo&s;tles directing any one to do any thing &s;hort of repentance and conver&s;ion; or &s;peak|ing of forgivene&s;s of &s;ins in any other connexion but with true repentance and conver&s;ion. It would therefore be very &s;trange and quite unac|countable
<PB N="131" REF="011295_0069_0F869F1602654418">if when St. Peter directs Simon to <HI>repent</HI> of his wickedne&s;s; and that with a view to obtain forgivene&s;s, he u&s;es the word repent in a different and oppo&s;ite &s;en&s;e from that in which his Lord and ma&s;ter had expre&s;sly commanded him to u&s;e it, and different from that in which he had u&s;ed it before on like occa&s;ions, and as it never is u&s;ed in another in&s;tance in all the new te&s;tament. If therefore the&s;e words of St. Peter; can, without doing manife&s;t violence to them, be under&s;tood con&s;i&s;tent with the orders which he had received from Chri&s;t, and with his way of addre&s;&s;ing men on &s;uch occa&s;ions in all other in&s;tances, we may be cer|tain we have the true &s;en&s;e of them; and may with confidence reject any other &s;en&s;e that any have devi&s;ed.</P>
<P>I therefore ob&s;erve, Simon is not directed to pray as an impenitent &s;in|ner, but as a penitent. "<HI>Repent</HI> of this thy wickedne&s;s, and pray to God." Is not the meaning of the&s;e words as plain, as the&s;e are when this &s;ame apo&s;tle &s;ays, "Repent and be converted; Repent, and be baptized"? The&s;e words have been long quoted as an inconte&s;table proof that unre|generate men are commanded to pray as impenitent and unregenerate; and many have done it without ever ob&s;erving that the word <HI>repent</HI> was to be found in the text. Whereas directly the contrary is mo&s;t evidently true. As well might we overlook the word repent in the other pa&s;&s;ages mentioned, and &s;ay St. Peter commanded his hearers to be baptized: yea, to be converted as impenitent, unregenerate &s;inners; and hence in|fer that to be baptized and converted are duties that the unregenerate are to do while &s;uch. With good rea&s;on therefore, I think, Dr. Dod|dridge &s;ays, in his note on this text, <Q>One would think that none could be <HI>&s;o wild</HI> as to imagine faith in Chri&s;t was not included in that repen|tance and prayer, which an <HI>apo&s;tle</HI> preaches to a baptized per&s;on as the way of obtaining forgivene&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>The only difficulty in the words is that St. Peter does not here &s;peak of forgivene&s;s of &s;in, as certainly connected with the repentance and prayer to which he exhorts Simon, which he does in the other in&s;tances mentioned: and it is certain that he who prays as a true penitent &s;hall be forgiven: Whereas it is here &s;aid, "IF PERHAPS the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee." Mr. M. and others have in&s;i&s;ted upon this as an argument that the prayer not of a true penitent, but of an impeni|tent, unregenerate &s;inner is here exhorted to.</P>
<P>Upon this it may be ob&s;erved, that the words, <HI>if perhaps,</HI> are not de|&s;igned to expre&s;s the uncertainty of his obtaining forgivene&s;s if he &s;hould repent of his wickedne&s;s and pray to God, as he was exhorted to do; but the doubtfulne&s;s and uncertainty whether there was forgivene&s;s for this his &s;in; and &s;o whether he would repent and pray. Simon had been guilty of a &s;in which it was to be feared was the &s;in again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, for which there was no forgivene&s;s, or at lea&s;t was bordering upon it: and it is in this view that St. Peter puts in the words <HI>if perhaps.</HI> As if he had &s;aid "If there is room left for repentance and pardon in this ca&s;e, which perhaps there is not." Thus the peculiar circum&s;tances of Simon's ca&s;e, rendering it doubtful whether there was any forgivene&s;s for his &s;in, are the only rea&s;on why the apo&s;tle puts in the&s;e words <HI>if perhaps,</HI> which we find he did not in other ca&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="011295_0070_0F869F16B8A0DF38">Dr. Doddridge under&s;tands the words in this &s;en&s;e, and gives the rea&s;on of it in the following words. <Q>The dubious manner in which he &s;peaks of his being forgiven intimates, not that his &s;incere repentance might po&s;&s;ibly fail of acceptance, for that is contrary to the whole tenor of the go&s;pel, but that after the commi&s;&s;ion of a &s;in, &s;o nearly approach|ing bla&s;phemy again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, there was little rea&s;on to hope he would ever be brought truly to repent.</Q> And tho' I do not quote the Dr. <HI>as an authority;</HI> yet I may be allowed perhaps to quote another author as &s;uch, at lea&s;t as one of &s;ufficient authority with Mr. M as it is no le&s;s an one than Mr. <HI>Mills</HI> him&s;elf. He &s;ays, <Q>This <HI>perhaps,</HI> as here u&s;ed, imports indeed only a &s;u&s;picion of the truth of the man's repen|tance, and not any doubt of God's forgivene&s;s in ca&s;e his repentance were &s;incere.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vind. of go&s;pel truth, &amp;c.

<P>But if this &s;en&s;e &s;hould not be &s;atisfying to all, there is another which &s;ome have e&s;pou&s;ed, that I will mention. The words in the original tran&s;lated <HI>if perhaps,</HI> do not appear to have this &s;ignification and denote doubtfulne&s;s or a <HI>perhaps,</HI> at lea&s;t not always; but are u&s;ed only as ex|pletives, without any particular meaning, taken by them&s;elves; or el&s;e are u&s;ed to make the a&s;&s;ertion more &s;trong and emphatical. According to this, the words &s;hould have been tran&s;lated, "Repent, &amp;c.&mdash;that the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee," or, "may <HI>indeed</HI> be forgiv|en." The &s;ame words in the original are u&s;ed in the fir&s;t v. of the pre|ceeding chap. by the high prie&s;t in his que&s;tion to Stephen, tran&s;lated "Are the&s;e things &s;o?" Where it would at be&s;t make a poor &s;en&s;e, to tran&s;late them as they are here, <HI>If perhaps,</HI> are the&s;e things &s;o?" And it is to be ob&s;erved that the&s;e &s;ame particles are found in the &s;eptuagint in 58. P&s;al, 1. v. which in our tran&s;lation &s;tands thus, "Do ye <HI>indeed</HI> &s;eek righteou&s;ne&s;s," &amp;c.</P>
<P>And now I leave it to the reader, whether either of the&s;e &s;en&s;es is not much more ea&s;y and natural than that which Mr. M. has put upon the words, which involves us in the inextricable difficulties, which have been mentioned? I am confident that it will appear to all who well attend to this matter, that this text is by no means a &s;ufficient foundation to build a doctrine upon, which has no &s;hadow of &s;upport from any other pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture; and which indeed is repugnant to the whole run of &s;crip|ture; and mo&s;t apparently contrary to the expre&s;s a&s;&s;ertions of Chri&s;t and St. Paul, as has been &s;hewn: e&s;pecially, if what has been ob&s;erved be kept in view, that to put this &s;en&s;e upon the text is to make the apo&s;tle &s;peak a language which he never u&s;es before or after, or any of the other apo&s;tles, and is directly contrary to the orders which Chri&s;t gave them; and that when another &s;en&s;e, free of all the&s;e difficulties, offers it&s;elf.</P>
<P>If they who now hold that the impenitent enemies of God and the go&s;|pel are commanded to do many impenitent unregenerate duties, would be as &s;ilent about it, as were the apo&s;tles, we &s;hould not hear much of this doctrine, if at all, and it would do very little hurt, and to be &s;ure, as lit|tle good.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="011295_0070_0F869F16B8A0DF38">MR. M. &s;ays &s;omething el&s;e, which perhaps he intends as an argu|ment for the &s;en&s;e of the text which he contends for, and therefore mu&s;t not be neglected. His words are, <Q>It is evident therefore, that as the apo&s;tle knew he was a &s;inner, &s;o he expected from him the prayer of a &s;inner.</Q> If there is any thing in this argument, it takes its force from this &s;uppo&s;ition, viz. that what&s;oever is &s;aid to an impenitent, un|regenerate &s;inner by way of exhortation or command, can require or propo&s;e nothing but what he may do and yet continue impenitent and unregenerate. Therefore every exhortation and command in the bible directed to &s;uch, requires nothing but impenitent, unregenerate doings. And becau&s;e this &s;uppo&s;ition is taken to be an undeniable maxim, and is built upon as &s;uch, not only by Mr. M. but others, I will take leave particularly to con&s;ider it here, and ob&s;erve the&s;e following things.</P>
<P N="1">I. If this maxim is true, then another is as true, viz. That it is not the duty of the impenitent, unregenerate to repent and believe the go&s;pel: nothing is to be required of them but what they may do un|der the influence of the di&s;po&s;ition and principles by which they are now governed. For if any thing more than this is their duty, more is certainly required of them, and they may and mu&s;t be commanded and exhorted to do more, even to repent and embrace the go&s;pel. Ac|cording to this therefore, the unregenerate, and impenitent are not to blame in the lea&s;t for being &s;o, or for not loving God and embracing the go&s;pel, but only for neglecting to do unregenerate duties; or tho&s;e which they may do con&s;i&s;tent with being enemies to Chri&s;t and con|tinuing in impenitence and unbelief&mdash;If the unregenerate are com|manded to repent and love God, for in&s;tance; the&s;e commands, as they re&s;pect them, only require the <HI>attempts</HI> and <HI>endeavours</HI> to repent and love God, which the impenitent enemies of God may exert, and yet continue in their impenitence and enmity again&s;t God. Thus, if St. Peter's knowing that Simon was an impenitent &s;inner, was a good rea&s;on why he &s;hould not exhort him to repent and pray to God as an impenitent never does, it mu&s;t be becau&s;e it was not his duty thus repent and pray and &s;o he could not be exhorted and commanded to do it.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">This appears to be Mr. M's notion of the matter by the tenor of of his book; and by the &s;en&s;e he puts on the words of St. Peter to Simon, as will be &s;een under the next argument; tho' there are a few expre&s;&s;ions in it, contrary to this. He &s;eems to think the duty of the unregenerate lies wholly in unregenerate doings, and not in loving God, &amp;c. Therefore all the commands and exhortations to them, are to &s;trive to love God, &amp;c. or to make tho&s;e <HI>attempts</HI> which per&s;ons un|regenerate may do while &s;uch: And he takes for granted that if they are not required to do unregenerate duties, nothing is required of them. He is not alone in this: many preachers and writers, have repre&s;ented the matter in the &s;ame light; yet I tru&s;t neither Mr. M. nor any of them will expre&s;sly undertake a vindication of this notion.</NOTE></P>
<P N="2">II. It al&s;o follows from this, that &s;inners may not be exhorted and
<PB N="134" REF="011295_0071_0F869F17772D2AF8">
commanded to do any thing from higher and better views, di&s;po&s;iti|on or principles than tho&s;e which they now actually have. The only rea&s;on why the impenitent enemies to God may not be exhorted to repent and love God, if there is any rea&s;on for this, is, that this requires higher principles than tho&s;e which they now act from; or, in other words, they have no heart, di&s;po&s;ition, or inclination to repent and love God, but their hearts are inclined to that which is directly the rever&s;e of this, as what they choo&s;e and prefer. And for the &s;ame rea&s;on, no per&s;on may be exhorted and commanded to do any thing which his heart is now &s;et again&s;t, and is not in the lea&s;t inclined to do; which therefore he will not do till he has a different di&s;po&s;ition and turn of mind, and views things in a different and better light than he now does. If it was not proper for St. Peter to exhort Simon tru|ly to repent and become a friend to Chri&s;t, and pray as &s;uch, becau&s;e he knew he was an impenitent enemy of Chri&s;t; and if we may hence &s;afely infer that he did not exhort him to this; we may for the &s;ame rea&s;on infer that he did not exhort him to repent and pray from any higher views and motives than merely worldly ones, for he had as much evidence that he was wholly under the influence of worldly mo|tives, as he had that he was an impenitent &s;inner.</P>
<P>And when Chri&s;t exhorted the Jews to labour for the meat which endureth unto everla&s;ting life; if their being unholy and perfectly di&s;|inclined to any thing truly good, is any rea&s;on and evidence that he does not exhort them to any thing incon&s;i&s;tent, with this perver&s;e, prevailing temper and di&s;po&s;ition of their hearts (and &s;uch an argu|ment has been <HI>gravely offered to the public,</HI> by tho&s;e who would not choo&s;e to have their talent at clear rea&s;oning called in que&s;tion;) I &s;ay, if this is &s;o; then &s;ince they were &s;o low &amp; &s;ordid in their views &amp; aims, as to be influenced to follow him, purely that they might get their fill of bread, we may &s;afely infer, that Chri&s;t did not in the&s;e words exhort them to any thing that they might not do under the influence of &s;uch low car|nal views and motives; and that he does not really exhort them to &s;eek any other bread but that with which they might fill their bellies, however his words may &s;eem, at fir&s;t view, to imply &s;omething more.</P>
<P N="3">III. Yea, it hence follows, that men are never to be commanded or exhorted to any thing which is contrary to their pre&s;ent prevailing will and inclination; for, if their prevailing inclination in one ca&s;e, is a good rea&s;on why they may not be exhorted and commanded to that which is contrary to it, it is as good a rea&s;on in any other ca&s;e of this kind what&s;oever. Therefore, according to this principle, if we knew what were the preci&s;e inclinations of Simon's heart when St. Peter &s;poke tho&s;e words to him, we may determine what he did, and what he did not exhort him to; as well as we can know that he did not exhort him to any thing contrary to the inclination and heart of an impenitent, unregenerate &s;inner. And we may be &s;ure Simon was fully inclined to repent of his wickedne&s;s, and pray to God, in the &s;en&s;e in which the apo&s;tle directed him to do it, and actually complied with the exhortation, el&s;e he would not have exhorted him to it.</P>
<P>According to this, no man can be directed and commanded to do
<PB N="135" REF="011295_0071_0F869F17772D2AF8">
that which is contrary to his inclination and heart, or which he is not willing to do. Which is the &s;ame as to &s;ay, no man can be under any law at all but his own inclination and will, which in all ca&s;es mu&s;t be the law and rule of his conduct; and &s;o long as he does as he plea|&s;es, he tran&s;gre&s;&s;es no law, and &s;o commits no &s;in. The con&s;equence is there can be no &s;uch thing in nature as &s;in and blame; for all men always do as they plea&s;e, or act according to the inclination of their own hearts. All the&s;e ab&s;urdities, I think, are evidently contained in the maxim under con&s;ideration. which Mr. M. and others &s;eem to take for granted, and build much upon.</P>
<P>Mr. M. goes on to produce two other texts; but &s;eems here to have &s;hifted his point, and in&s;tead of attempting to prove by them that there are duties enjoined on the impenitent, to be done by them while they remain &s;o, he &s;eeks only to prove that there are <HI>encouragements</HI> to &s;uch to u&s;e means, &amp;c. One of the&s;e is in the following words, "Then &s;hall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ho&s; VI. 3.</NOTE> He &s;ays, <Q>How, as the body of the people, by far the greater number comprehended in the pronoun <HI>we,</HI> were undoubtedly &s;inners, de&s;titute of the true know|ledge of God, as the words plainly hold forth; can any thing le&s;s be under&s;tood by the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, "if we follow on to know," than that the <HI>only encouragement</HI> &s;inners de&s;titute of the &s;aving knowledge of God have of attaining to it, is a per&s;evering attendance on all God's appointed means, as &s;inners, until by grace they become &s;uc|ce&s;sful?<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 73, 74.</NOTE></Q> Upon this it may be ob&s;erved,</P>
<P N="1">I. This text ri&s;es much higher than <HI>encouragement;</HI> it contains an <HI>expre&s;s promi&s;e</HI> to them that follow on to know. So that if follow|ing on to know means the doings of the unregenerate, as Mr. M. &s;ays it does, the&s;e are promi&s;es to the doings of the unregenerate. I won|der he did not ob&s;erve this: Did he forget that he had wrote a book to prove the contrary: and had rendered his public thanks to me, for <HI>fini&s;hing this debate?</HI> He <HI>may now thank him&s;elf,</HI> for giving this point up; for he has certainly contradicted all this, by &s;aying the unrege|nerate follow on to know the Lord, and that the&s;e words are &s;poken of &s;uch. He has now got on the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion, and found an expre&s;s promi&s;e to unregenerate doings, and might as well have ap|plied all the promi&s;es in the bible to them. What rea&s;on, what right had he to lower down this promi&s;e, and call it only an <HI>encouragement?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. There is not the lea&s;t evidence that the per&s;ons into who&s;e mouths the&s;e words are put, have the character of impenitent, unregenerate &s;inners; but the contrary is mo&s;t evident. The whole from the fir&s;t ver&s;e to this is the language of God's people, &s;ubmitting and returning to him, under his corrections, and repre&s;ents that temper of mind, and tho&s;e exerci&s;es, which ought to take place, and do actually take place in the truly penitent, and which are connected with deliverance and divine favor.</P>
<P>The other text which he mentions here is this, <Q>I will yet for this be enquired of by the hou&s;e of I&s;rael to do it for them.<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Ezek. XXXVI. 37</NOTE></Q> He quotes
<PB N="136" REF="011295_0072_0F869F186542E508">
this here not as commanding a duty, but only as an encouragement to the unregenerate. He expre&s;sly &s;ays, <Q>the words are &s;poken in the way of a prediction or prophecy, and &s;hewed them what God had absolutely, not conditionally, determined to accompli&s;h for his peo|ple.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 83</NOTE></Q> What God does reveal as a promi&s;e of what he will do, can|not be con&s;idered as a command. Whether the enquiry here &s;poken of points out the prayers and &s;eeking of the unregenerate, I particularly con&s;idered, in my remarks on Doct. Mayhew's &s;ermons, and &s;uppo&s;e I produced evidence that it does not. Mr. M. has a large note on this text to prove that I have mi&s;under&s;tood it, as well as the Doctor. But to this I &s;hall have &s;omething to &s;ay in another place.</P>
<P N="2">II. Mr. M. forms another argument from the <HI>encouragement</HI> which is given in the word of God to &s;inners to attend on means, &amp;c.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P. 78,&mdash;82.</NOTE> He ar|gues that <Q>from the encouragement &s;et before Simon to repent &amp; pray, i. e. to attempt the performance of tho&s;e duties, tho' on no higher principles than that of natural con&s;cience&mdash;which encouragement &s;tands good to all the unregenerate, under the external light and ad|vantages of the go&s;pel, 'tis evident that God doth &s;ome way <HI>re|quire</HI> the&s;e e&s;&s;ays of the unregenerate: otherwi&s;e he encourages them to that in his wor&s;hip, which he no way, in any &s;en&s;e requires in his word. Would no: this be for the Almighty to encourage his crea|tures to practi&s;e will-wor&s;hip, and the inventions of men; which God every where condemns in his word, as utterly &s;inful. And can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to the purity of his nature, to encourage his creatures to that which is utterly &s;inful? Sure it cannot. It mu&s;t therefore hence clearly follow, that the unregenerate, under the light and advantages of the go&s;pel, are &s;omeway required to make the&s;e e&s;&s;ays, to repent, pray, &amp;c.</Q> On the&s;e words I ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1. If the words of St. Peter to Simon are not a command to him to repent and pray in an unregenerate manner, or as an impenitent enemy to God, which Mr. M. has in&s;i&s;ted they are; then they are not a com|mand to do any thing, as an impenitent. Mr. M. has remarkably low|ered down here, and con&s;iders the&s;e words not as an expre&s;s command or exhortation to do any thing; but only as an <HI>encouragement</HI> &s;et before Simon to <HI>attempt</HI> to repent and pray; not a command really to do them. He might ju&s;t as rea&s;onably con&s;true away all the commands in the bi|ble, and repre&s;ent them to be nothing but <HI>encouragements</HI> to <HI>attempt</HI> to do &s;omething.</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;inner who is utterly impenitent, never does truly attempt to repent, and pray as a penitent. He never has the lea&s;t motion of heart or will this way: for his whole heart is, by the &s;uppo&s;ition, in direct oppo&s;ition to this; therefore the more he exerci&s;es him&s;elf about it, or the more exerci&s;es he has, the more he oppo&s;es it. We may therefore be &s;ure that the &s;cripture no where &s;ays any thing to encou|rage &s;uch attempts to repent, &amp;c. which are con&s;i&s;tent with perfect im|penitence, and enmity again&s;t God; becau&s;e there are not in nature any &s;uch attempts; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition involves the mo&s;t gro&s;s con|tradiction; &s;uch a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> never exi&s;ted, except in the minds of tho&s;e
<PB N="137" REF="011295_0072_0F869F186542E508">
who &s;uppo&s;e that the unregenerate are penitent and friendly to God and the go&s;pel in a degree; or of tho&s;e who are ab&s;urd enough to hold that the perfectly impenitent and enemies to God, are inclined to re|pent and di&s;po&s;ed to be friendly to him. Mr. M. is to be ranked a|mong both the&s;e, for he &s;uppo&s;es each of the&s;e in their turns.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is difficult, I think, to know what Mr. M. means by "will wor&s;hip, and the inventions of men," as applied to the ca&s;e before us. If by this he means &s;omething external, ways of wor&s;hip and conduct which men invent and practi&s;e, to expre&s;s their devotion and re&s;pect to God, which I &s;uppo&s;e is the &s;en&s;e in which the&s;e phra&s;es are commonly u&s;ed, they are not applicable to this ca&s;e; for it is not pretended by any one that the unregenerate or any other are urged to any &s;uch thing. If he means any motions and exerci&s;es of the heart that are neither right nor wrong, in them&s;elves, neither &s;inful nor holy, the&s;e are indeed "the inventions of men," of Mr. M. at lea&s;t; for there are in reality no &s;uch, which are not holy, and yet not utterly &s;inful,"</P>
<P>All the &s;eeming force and plau&s;iblene&s;s in what Mr. M. &s;ays here, if there <HI>&s;eems</HI> to be any, lies in the ambiguity of the word <HI>encouragement,</HI> which may be taken, in different &s;en&s;es, and is often u&s;ed &s;o.</P>
<P>To encourage, &s;ometimes means to invite, urge, and exhort a per&s;on to &s;omething, urging him to it by good rea&s;ons and motives. In this &s;en&s;e God's encouragements and commands cannot be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed; for where there is &s;uch encouragement, there is a command, implied or expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Sometimes encouragement means that which gives a hope and pro&s;|pect of &s;ucce&s;s in any bu&s;ine&s;s and pur&s;uit. And when we &s;ay a per|&s;on has encouragement to do this or the other thing, we mean that this is the mo&s;t likely way to obtain hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> end which he is pur&s;uing. And to encourage him to any particular way of conduct, is to let him know that this is the mo&s;t hopeful way to mi&s;s of the evil he dreads, and obtain what he &s;ets up, as the object of his pur&s;uit, be that what it will.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t &s;en&s;e of encouragement mentioned, God encourages men to holine&s;s, and nothing el&s;e. In the la&s;t &s;en&s;e, he encourages men, let their hearts be as &s;inful and oppo&s;ite to him as they will, to at|tend on the means of grace. He has &s;o ordered things that this is the mo&s;t likely way to e&s;cape the greate&s;t evil, and be happy forever; &s;o that when they come to view things in any mea&s;ure as they are, and are above all things afraid of eternal de&s;truction, and de&s;irous of fu|ture happine&s;s, they will be induced from a principle of &s;elf-love, or &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, even that very principle which &s;ets their hearts again&s;t God, and leads them into all the wickedne&s;s they practi&s;e, with great care and anxiety to attend on the&s;e means. The whole encouragement, as laid before them, lies in its being the mo&s;t hopeful and likely way to promote their intere&s;t, and an&s;wer the end which they are pur&s;uing. God has &s;o contrived and ordered things, that whenever the &s;inner's con&s;cience is thoroughly awakened and convinced, and he comes to a &s;en&s;e of the wretchedne&s;s of his ca&s;e, and attends to what is contained
<PB N="138" REF="011295_0073_0F869F1D82CC27F0">
in divine revelation, and labours under no particular delu&s;ion; he will for&s;ake tho&s;e ways in which &s;ecure &s;inners live, and pur&s;ue the mo&s;t likely way to obtain deliverance, and eternal &s;alvation, however vile his heart is, and tho' he is a greater enemy to God, and all that is good now, than he was before. And thus there is encouragement to all this, and this is the encouragement God &s;ets before the &s;inner. And a per|&s;on may be "utterly &s;inful;" that is, inclined to nothing el&s;e but &s;in; yea may be growing more and more guilty and vile continually, and yet take this encouragement, and act upon it.</P>
<P>He who will con&s;ider the&s;e things, mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, I think, that the encouragement &s;inners have to attend on means, &amp;c. is con&s;i&s;tent with their obeying no command, and doing no duty, while they act under the influence of this encouragement; and that God may, and does con|&s;i&s;tently with the purity of his nature, encourage his creatures to that, in doing which they are utterly &s;inful: And that Mr. M. has confu|&s;ed him&s;elf by u&s;ing the word <HI>encouragement</HI> in an indeterminate or wrong &s;en&s;e, as many others have done. Yea, I think it will be evi|dent to &s;uch a reader, that the pa&s;&s;age I am con&s;idering is &s;o far from proving any thing, that it is quite unintelligible, and contains in it, as many ab&s;urdities, at lea&s;t, as there are &s;entences.</P>
<P>Before I leave this head about encouragement, I would ob&s;erve, that when Mr. M. undertakes to &s;hew what encoueagement there is to &s;in|ners, on his plan of commands to do unregenerate duties, he &s;eems to have a right notion of encouragement; but finds no more than they do who teach the unregenerate that they do no duty while they continue &s;o, and places it upon the &s;ame bottom they do, in the words follow|ing, <Q>To all who with earne&s;t concern, thus attend on God's appoint|ed means, the language <HI>&s;cripture encouragement</HI> is, may be God will be gracious, who can tell, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> perhaps &s;overeign grace may be di&s;played for your help, in this way. It implies in it that God is a God of infinite goodne&s;s, can exerci&s;e his mercy towards them thro' Chri&s;t in this way, con&s;i&s;tent with the honor of all his other perfecti|ons; and that they are in &s;ome mea&s;ure in the way in which he is wont to be&s;tow mercy on peri&s;hing &s;inners whenever he does be&s;tow it; the way in which millions have found mercy; and the way out of which he has determined, in the ordinary di&s;pen&s;ation of his grace, not to be&s;tow it.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">P. 72.</NOTE></Q> I have endeavoured particularly to &s;hew that the &s;inner has all this encouragement in the u&s;e of means, in my <HI>tenth</HI> &s;ection.&mdash;And when he again undertakes to &s;hew "the u&s;efulne&s;s and importance" of the truth he contends for,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 82. notes.</NOTE> he mentions nothing but what is con&s;i&s;tent with the doctrine he is oppo&s;ing.</P>
<P N="3">III. ANOTHER of Mr. M's arguments is in the following words, <Q>Again, it is further evident, that the unregenerate are otherwi&s;e re|quired to attend on the means of grace, than meerly by being cal|led upon to repent and believe, in a go&s;pel &s;en&s;e: Becau&s;e if they are not, then none of the unregenerate would be required to attend on the means of grace, until they had attained to a competency of &s;peculative knowledge, in order to &s;aving faith; &s;ince till then they
<PB N="139" REF="011295_0073_0F869F1D82CC27F0">
are under a natural impo&s;&s;ibility of believing; <HI>and &s;o of being im|mediately required to believe.</HI> And &s;ince the go&s;pel does not require any natural impo&s;&s;ibility, as the condition of life, it mu&s;t thence clearly follow upon this principle, they are not required to attend on means at all.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I would here ju&s;t ob&s;erve, that I believe Mr. M. will not be able to prove one thing which he here a&s;&s;erts, viz. that there is a natural impo&s;&s;ibility in requiring men to do, what is naturally impo&s;&s;ible to them. There is no more <HI>natural impo&s;&s;ibility</HI> in doing this, than there is in requiring any thing el&s;e, however <HI>unrea&s;onable</HI> it may be. I know not why Mr. M. a&s;&s;erted this, &s;ince, if it was true, it is nothing to his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>P. 83, 84, 85.</P></NOTE></Q></P>
<P>ANSWER. The word of God requires &s;inners to be always &s;o friendly to him at heart, as to be di&s;po&s;ed and ready to believe every truth which he reveals and propo&s;es to them, and to have exerci&s;es an&s;werable to that truth; or to receive the love of the truth. They are under no natural impo&s;&s;ibility of doing this. If they do this they will not attend on means, as do the impenitent and unregenerate; therefore they are not required to attend on means in any one in&s;tance as &s;uch, or with an impenitent unbelieving heart. Mr. M. &s;ays, very agreeable to truth, <Q>God don't make the depraved will of the crea|ture the rule of his duty: but requires him to reach the appointed end. Make you a new heart and a new &s;pirit, for why will ye die? Turn your&s;elves and live ye?<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 52.</NOTE></Q> And he allows that <HI>all</HI> under the go&s;pel are required to pray, and do all other duties in <HI>a gracious manner;</HI> which, he will not deny, implies faith.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 97.</NOTE> How came he, ju&s;t now, in direct contradiction to this, to &s;ay all are not immediate|ly required to believe? God does not require men to believe any truth which never has been propo&s;ed to them, and which they have had no opportunity to under&s;tand: but he requires them to attend to every truth &s;et before them, and receive it with a penitent heart, and in the exerci&s;e of love to him.</P>
<P>It is true, there are many under the go&s;pel who have not that &s;pe|culative knowledge nece&s;&s;ary in order to their exerci&s;ing faith in Chri&s;t; but this is wholly their own fault, owing entirely to their depraved wills. Were their hearts as they ought to be, they would under&s;tand and receive every truth as &s;oon as propo&s;ed to them: and this is re|quired of them, and nothing le&s;s. If they did &s;o, they would in no in&s;tance attend on means as do impenitent unbelievers. Though God will not give them a new heart, and bring them to a right temper and di&s;po&s;ition of mind, while they are inattentive and ignorant; yet he always requires that di&s;po&s;ition of mind which is incon&s;i&s;tent with, their inattention and ignorance: for as he does not make the depraved will of &s;inners the rule of their duty; &s;o he does not make the rule of
<PB N="140" REF="011295_0074_0F869F1EAB6C7098">
their duty the rule of his conduct, in giving or not giving a new heart. Mr. M. &s;ays <Q>If there be &s;ome under the go&s;pel that are de&s;titute of it</Q> (i. e. of a competency of &s;peculative knowledge, in order to faith) <Q>as not having opportunity and advantages for acquiring of it, they are not required to attend on means of grace at all.</Q> (that is, on my plan)<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">P. 87-88.</NOTE> I an&s;wer, there is no &s;uch in&s;tance. All under the go&s;pel have this opportunity and advantage, and their ignorance, impenitence, and unbelief is their own fault. Were they, in any mea|&s;ure, as God requires them to be, they would have under&s;tood the truth when fir&s;t propo&s;ed, that is, as &s;oon as they became moral agents, in the exerci&s;e of love, repentance and faith.</P>
<P>If per&s;ons under the go&s;pel were not required to attend on means until, with all their depravity, &s;tupidity and dullne&s;s, they had ob|tained a good degree of &s;peculative knowledge; and could not be re|quired to repent and believe, till in a long cour&s;e of the u&s;e of means they had attained to this, how can we account for our Saviour's call|ing upon men, when he fir&s;t began to preach to them, to "repent and believe the go&s;pel?" And why did the apo&s;tles direct men immedi|ately to repent and be converted, and believe on Je&s;us Chri&s;t? If they might preach &s;o to per&s;ons who had much le&s;s opportunity and advantage to get &s;peculative knowledge, than all under the go&s;pel now have, &s;urely this may be required of all now. And this is a pat|tern which all preachers of the go&s;pel ought to follow, and not to de|vi&s;e another way of preaching and addre&s;&s;ing &s;inners; calling upon them to do a &s;et of duties &s;hort of repentance and faith, under the notion that the latter are not yet their duty. The truths of the go&s;pel ought to be clearly preached and &s;et before &s;inners, and one truth is, that they are required to repent and believe the go&s;pel as &s;oon as propo&s;ed; and that he that believeth not, &s;hall be damned.</P>
<P N="4">IV. MR. M. undertakes to prove that the unregenerate are required to do duty in an <HI>ungracious</HI> manner; or, as he expre&s;&s;es it, "though they fail and come &s;hort of a gracious manner," by a&s;&s;erting and at|tempting to prove that the regenerate, or children of God, are re|quired to do duties in this manner.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P. 97.</NOTE></P>
<P>The argument &s;tands thus. Duties are required of the regenerate, or true Chri&s;tian, which they mu&s;t, and often do con&s;cientiou&s;ly per|form, though they have no gracious or holy exerci&s;es, but come wholly &s;hort of the lea&s;t degree of love to God or man. Therefore the &s;ame duties are required of the unregenerate, as they may do them without any grace, as well as the regenerate, &amp; as no truly good and ho|ly exerci&s;es of heart are nece&s;&s;ary or required in order to perform them.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e this argument is quite new, and that Mr. M. in advanc|ing it, is perfectly an original. And therefore that I &s;hall be the fir&s;t that ever attempted to an&s;wer it. Indeed, it appears to me to want no great matter of an an&s;wer.</P>
<P>In this argument Mr. M. &s;uppo&s;es, not only that a principle of grace may be perfectly dormant and unactive in the true Chri&s;tian; &s;o that in this re&s;pect he may not differ at all from him who is ignorant
<PB N="141" REF="011295_0074_0F869F1EAB6C7098">
of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and perfectly impenitent, and ob&s;tinately hates his whole character: but that &s;uch may and actually do con&s;cientiou&s;ly attend on the duties of the fir&s;t and &s;econd table, and u&s;e con&s;cienti|ous and painful endeavours, and their utmo&s;t efforts to do them in a gracious manner, or in the exerci&s;e of true love to God and man: and yet not have the lea&s;t degree of &s;uch exerci&s;e, but fall wholly &s;hort of it in all they do, having nothing better in their heart, or more like true Chri&s;tian holine&s;s, than the impenitent unbeliever may have: and that when this is the ca&s;e they do that duty, which God requires of them! Such &s;uppo&s;itions as the&s;e, I conclude, will appear not only weak and ab&s;urd, but very whim&s;ical and ridiculous to the judi|cious reader; and more &s;o as they are repre&s;ented in Mr. M's book<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 97,&mdash;101.</NOTE> than in this abridgement.</P>
<P>I have often heard them tell of <HI>dead Chri&s;tians;</HI> by which I &s;uppo&s;e they mean, Chri&s;tians who have no exerci&s;es of grace at &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons. But &s;uch mu&s;t be <HI>very dead</HI> indeed; I &s;hould think "twice dead, and plucked up by the roots," who, when they &s;train &s;o hard, con&s;cien|tiou&s;ly take &s;o much pains, and exert their repeated and utmo&s;t en|deavour, to call up and put forth the exerci&s;e of grace, are not able to produce the lea&s;t &s;park or motion of this kind. Mr. M. puts his Chri&s;tian to as hard a ta&s;k, as Elijah did the prophets of Baal: he may "cry aloud," be in the greate&s;t earne&s;t, and put forth his utmo&s;t en|deavours and efforts to wake up, or recall his grace; but it is either too fa&s;t a&s;leep to be awaked, or is gone on a journey, &amp; &s;o cannot be recalled. However he gives him more con&s;olation than tho&s;e pro|phets had; for if the Chri&s;tian utterly fails in his con&s;cientious at|tempt, and remains as gracele&s;s as he who has no grace, he will not lo&s;e his pains: &s;eeing he, after all, does his duty.</P>
<P>But what are the&s;e con&s;cientious endeavours to exerci&s;e grace, or to perform duties in a gracious manner? Do they imply any incli|nation of heart towards holine&s;s, or any actual idea, or liking of that in which holine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts? No: for this is the exerci&s;e of grace. They mu&s;t therefore con&s;i&s;t in exerci&s;es of heart directly oppo&s;ite to holine&s;s, or in exerci&s;es and endeavours which are neutral, neither in|clined nor tending to the exerci&s;e of grace; nor to that which is un|friendly and contrary to it. The former cannot be meant I conclude. Nor can they con&s;i&s;t in the latter, for two rea&s;ons. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> there are in nature no &s;uch exerci&s;es and con&s;cientious endeavours, which are perfectly and equally indifferent towards holine&s;s and &s;in, and imply no inclination to one or the other. <HI>Secondly,</HI> If there could be any &s;uch, they would be no more endeavours to do duty in a gracious man|ner, than in an ungracious and &s;inful manner; becau&s;e, by the &s;up|po&s;ition, there is no more of an inclination or tendency to the former than to the latter.</P>
<P>The &s;cripture gives us a quite different idea of the Chri&s;tian from this which Mr. M. has &s;et before us. According to that, the Chri&s;tian is wholly made up of fle&s;h and &s;pirit, two different and oppo&s;ite prin|ciples,
<PB N="142" REF="011295_0075_0F869F1F631AFBF8">
and the latter is as con&s;tantly exerci&s;ed as the former, and is no more dead or a&s;leep than the former, though it may be exerci&s;ed in a weak and low degree. "The fle&s;h lu&s;teth again&s;t the &s;pirit, and the &s;pirit again&s;t the fle&s;h: and the&s;e are contrary one to the other."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. V. 17.</NOTE>. The &s;pirit is never &s;aid to be dead; but on the contrary the Chri&s;tian has "<HI>crucified</HI> the fle&s;h, with the affections and lu&s;ts,"<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">v. 24.</NOTE> and "the law of the &s;pirit of life has made him free from the law of &s;in and death."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. VIII. 2.</NOTE> And there is not one word &s;aid in the bible about the&s;e <HI>gracele&s;s</HI> duties of Chri&s;tians; not one exhortation to them, or the lea&s;t hint about them in all the New Te&s;tament, where there are &s;uch a number of letters wrote to Chri&s;tians, and &s;o many directions and pre|cepts given to them. I am confident, and every one el&s;e will be &s;o, I tru&s;t, that Mr. M.'s regenerate, dead, <HI>gracele&s;s</HI> Chri&s;tian, has no exi&s;tence in the New Te&s;tament, nor in nature. The character he gives of &s;uch an one being quite un&s;criptural, and in it&s;elf a contra|diction.</P>
<P>Mr. M.'s repre&s;entation of this matter, is not only un&s;criptural, but a fatal re&s;ting place for many nominal Chri&s;tians; a refuge of lies, in which many have doubtle&s;s peri&s;hed. They think they are not to blame for not acting, and doing duties in "a gracious man|ner." Grace is from God, and they can exerci&s;e no degree of this without the &s;pirit of God, which is not at their di&s;po&s;al, but is given or withheld as God plea&s;es. They therefore re&s;t in their good de|&s;ires and endeavours, and what they call con&s;cientious performance of duty, as all that is required of them; not con&s;idering that they are commanded to be "filled with the &s;pirit," and always to live and walk in the &s;pirit, and bring forth the fruits of the &s;pirit; and that not to do &s;o, is to oppo&s;e and quench the &s;pirit, and to live after the fle&s;h. Mr. M. expre&s;sly &s;ays, that if Chri&s;tians, as well as the un|regenerate, are not required to do duty not in "a gracious manner," or without the exerci&s;e of holine&s;s, then <Q>no chri&s;tian duty is required of us, but as we are moved by the &s;pirit, &s;ince this can't be done but as moved and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the &s;pirit.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">P. 107.</NOTE></Q> What can be the meaning of this, but that Chri&s;tians are under no obligation to do duty, in a gracious manner, unle&s;s when actually moved and influenced thereto by the &s;pirit of God; which not being always the ca&s;e, they are not at all to blame for not acting in "a gracious manner;" but have only to wait till God &s;hall move them by his &s;pirit? Sweet doctrine to many gracele&s;s Chri&s;tians, and tends to fix them on the fatal rock, on which multitudes are peri&s;hing!</P>
<P>THE rea&s;on Mr. M. gives why the&s;e gracele&s;s, unregenerate duties are equally required of the regenerate and unregenerate is remarkable, and worthy of particular notice here. He &s;ays <Q>God don't require the&s;e things, becau&s;e they have in them any po&s;itive virtue, or true moral goodne&s;s; but becau&s;e of a <HI>negative</HI> moral goodne&s;s they have in them; i. e. the ab&s;ence of a greater degree of true moral
<PB N="143" REF="011295_0075_0F869F1F631AFBF8">
evil, than there would be in the carele&s;s neglect of them.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 98, 99.</NOTE></Q> And again he &s;ays, the rea&s;on of the requirement of the&s;e performances is <Q>not becau&s;e they are holy; but becau&s;e they are <HI>le&s;s unholy.</HI> There is a le&s;s degree of true moral evil in the con&s;cientious performance of them, than in the contemptuous neglect of them, and <HI>therefore</HI> are they required.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 101.</NOTE></Q> On this I have two things to ob&s;erve.</P>
<P N="1">1. Mr. M. has here reduced his commands to meer <HI>prohibitions</HI> in which God only forbids &s;in. And the duty he contends for is nothing but ab&s;tinence from &s;in, or not committing it: or rather committing a le&s;s &s;in in&s;tead of a greater. Undoubtedly God <HI>forbids</HI> all &s;in of every degree and kind, but this, I conceive, is quite different from commanding duty. Nor is every in&s;tance or degree of ab&s;tinence from &s;in, or of the non-commi&s;&s;ion of &s;in, doing duty, as Mr. M. here &s;uppo&s;es. A tree or hor&s;e commits no &s;in; but none will &s;ay they do any duty. But a tree does as much duty as any man does in meerly not committing &s;in; and a rock has as much "negative moral good|ne&s;s" as the be&s;t man on earth, and much more; and &s;o more of Mr. M.'s negative duty, as there is le&s;s moral evil; yea, the ab&s;ence of every degree of moral evil.</P>
<P>I think Mr. M. has run into all this confu&s;ion and ab&s;urdity by con|founding prohibitions with commands, and not di&s;tingui&s;hing doing duty, from meerly not committing &s;in.</P>
<P N="2">2. If every in&s;tance of ab&s;taining, from any &s;in, or greater degree of &s;in, that might be committed, is doing duty, as it is according to Mr. M. then all men do &s;ome duty, &s;omething that God requires; for none commit all the &s;in that in nature is po&s;&s;ible, and the &s;ins of mo&s;t are much le&s;s than tho&s;e of the greate&s;t &s;inner that ever lived: all the&s;e have therefore a great degree of "negative moral goodne&s;s," or the ab&s;ence of a great degree of true moral evil. And the greate&s;t &s;inner of all, has a con&s;iderable degree of this &s;ort of moral goodne&s;s; for it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that he is as great a &s;inner as is po&s;&s;ible. Yea, will it not follow that mo&s;t of mankind have much more moral good|ne&s;s, and do much more duty, than &s;in? No individual commits half the &s;in that in nature is po&s;&s;ible; and there are millions of &s;ins actually committed, of which he is not guilty. All his &s;ins put together, are as nothing to the &s;ins of the whole world of mankind, and of all the fal|len angels. Now if his not committing all this is negative moral good|ne&s;s, and duty, his &s;in hardly bears any proportion to his goodne&s;s and duty.</P>
<P>And according to Mr. M. every le&s;s &s;in, every &s;in except the greate&s;t of all that ever was committed, or can be, is in &s;ome &s;en&s;e required of God, viz. as having a degree of negative moral goodne&s;s in it, or not being &s;o bad and &s;inful as &s;omething el&s;e, which might take place in its room. Con&s;equently God requires and commands every &s;in in the univer&s;e, except it be the greate&s;t of all; and even that too, if there is le&s;s moral evil in it, than might have been, on any &s;uppo&s;ition. All the&s;e I &s;ay mu&s;t be commanded for the &s;ame rea&s;on which Mr. M. gives for gracele&s;s duties being required; for "there is a le&s;s degree of true
<PB N="144" REF="011295_0076_0F869F1FC4A1F190">
moral evil in them," than in the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible &s;in, "and THEREFORE they are required." I leave it to the reader, whether the&s;e con&s;equences are not fairly deduced from Mr. M's principles, and way of rea&s;oning on this head.</P>
<P N="5">V. MR. M. forms another argument thus. It is a &s;in to di&s;obey and counteract the dictates of natural con&s;cience; to be without natu|ral gratitude to God and our benefactors among men, from a principle of &s;elf-love: And to be without natural affection, &s;uch as the affection of parents to children, &amp;c. All the&s;e appear from &s;cripture and rea|&s;on to be &s;inful, and even a high degree of wickedne&s;s. It hence fol|lows that, acting agreeable to the dictates of con&s;cience; the exerci&s;e of gratitude merely from a principle of &s;elf-love, and natural affection between parents and children, &amp;c. which are found with the unrege|nerate, as well as others, are duties and required of God: for if they are not required, "the ab&s;ence of them would be no &s;in: Becau&s;e "where there is no law, there is no tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>Mr. M. introduces this argument P. 101. And then re&s;umes it again, and dwells long upon it from P. 109. to P. 113. I have not &s;tated it exactly in his words, as this would take up too much room; but &s;up|po&s;e it is here &s;et in as &s;trong and advantageous a light, as it &s;tands in his book. The reader who has acce&s;s to that may &s;atisfy him&s;elf. And he will be ready to judge whether there is any weight in this ar|gument, when he has attended to the following particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. Acting contrary to the dictates of con&s;cience is in all ca&s;es a &s;in; becau&s;e this is acting contrary to love to God. It does not follow as a con&s;equence, that acting agreeable to the dictates of con&s;cience is vir|tue or duty; but only that love to God is &s;o. In this ca&s;e, the &s;in of acting contrary to the dictates of con&s;cience does not &s;tand in oppo&s;ition to acting according to the dictates of it; but to obedience to God's law, which requires love to him. Both of the former may be &s;in. It is always contrary to God's law, and is &s;in to di&s;regard the dictates of con&s;cience, and that may be, and often is a &s;in, and directly contrary to God's law, which is agreeable to the dictates of con&s;cience. The&s;e are, in this re&s;pect, not in oppo&s;ition to each other, but both are in op|po&s;ition to the divine law. The phari&s;ee who went up to the temple to pray, had lived in obedience to his con&s;cience, and acted up to the dictates of it; and did &s;o in the addre&s;s he made to God; Yet I &s;up|po&s;e none will &s;ay he was doing his duty, and obeying God's com|mands; or that God required him to do as he did, when he &s;tood praying. To be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Mr. M. will not; for he repre&s;ents him as guilty of high-handed wickedne&s;s in making this prayer, and even one of the vile&s;t &s;inners on earth. In obeying his con&s;cience, he di&s;obeyed God, in&s;tead of obeying him, or being friendly to him in the lea&s;t degree. Acting again&s;t the dictates of con&s;cience is &s;inful, becau&s;e this is in all ca&s;es acting again&s;t God: Therefore acting agreeable to the dictates of con&s;cience is &s;in, when per&s;ons doing thus act again&s;t God, which is the ca&s;e always when they are enemies to him, as are all the unregenerate.</P>

V. 46, 47.</NOTE> When St. Paul &s;ays of the Gentiles "Neither were they thankful;" it does not appear that he &s;peaks of thankfulne&s;s, from natural principles as Mr. M. expre&s;&s;es it, or a principle of &s;elf-love; but of that thankfulne&s;s which God's law requires, and con&s;i&s;ts in true love to God. It is altogether without foundation, or the lea&s;t evidence that Mr. M. &s;uppo&s;es that when St. Paul &s;peaks of the Gentiles not glorifying God as God, and not being thankful, he means glorifying God, and rendering gratitude to him upon natural principles, or from &s;elf-love. They were bound by the highe&s;t obligations to glorify God and expre&s;s their gratitude to him from the highe&s;t and be&s;t principles even true love to him, and had no excu&s;e for not doing it: and it would be perfectly unaccountable if St. Paul quite overlooked this the greate&s;t of all their crimes, when he was &s;etting forth the greatne&s;s of their wickedne&s;s, and &s;peaks only of that which was immen&s;ely le&s;s criminal, and is really no crime, any further that it is contrary to true love to God. I can account for Mr. M's running into this notion no other way but by concluding he &s;uppo&s;ed that the Gentiles and all men unregenerate are not obliged to act from any higher principles, than tho&s;e he calls natural; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> notion which he &s;eems to carry with him thro' his book, tho' he &s;ometimes contradicts it.</P>
<P>What is called natural affection cannot be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed and rooted out but by the prevalence of a high degree of &s;infulne&s;s. Therefore to be without natural affection is an argument and evidence of the pre|valence of a great degree of wickedne&s;s. It was therefore to the a|po&s;tle's purpo&s;e to mention this, in order to &s;hew the bad character of the per&s;ons he was de&s;cribing. This is con&s;i&s;tent with there being no command requiring the mere exerci&s;e of natural affection, or prohi|bition, forbidding the want of it. The &s;trong and confirmed exerci&s;e of pride and &s;en&s;uality (to u&s;e pre&s;ident Edwards's words quoted by Mr. M.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 113.</NOTE>) "tend to overbear and greatly dimini&s;h the exerci&s;es of "tho&s;e u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary principles of nature." And nothing el&s;e will do it. Therefore where natural affection is overborn and dimi|ni&s;hed, it is a certain evidence of a very bad, vile character. To be without natural affection, and to be mon&s;trou&s;ly wicked is the &s;ame thing. Yet natural affection is not a virtue, nor is it in any &s;en&s;e re|quired as a duty. They who exerci&s;e it in the highe&s;t degree, are herein no more obedient, and do no more duty than the brutes, is whom it takes place as well as in men; as Mr. M. ob&s;erves, to be without natural affection, is <Q>falling below even the brutal nature, that is wont to retain that in&s;tinct of fondne&s;s to their young.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 113.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P N="4">4. By being without natural affection, is intended &s;omething more than what is meerly negative, or not being influenced by this princi|ple. It intends that exerci&s;e and conduct which is directly contrary to it, which &s;hews that it is overborn and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. Thus the Heathen, in many in&s;tances, were without natural affection, i. e.
<PB N="146" REF="011295_0077_0F869F2089745D48">
acted directly contrary to it, when they burnt their children to death, as a &s;acrifice to their Gods. The &s;on is &s;aid to be without natural af|fection, when he puts an end to his aged father's life, that he may in|herit his e&s;tate. The father is &s;aid to be without natural affection when he acts a cruel part to his child, and &s;ells it into the hands of barbarous men, to get money to enable him to pur&s;ue his intemperance and lewd|ne&s;s. In this ca&s;e that wickedne&s;s, which leads a man to coun|teract natural affection, and &s;uppre&s;s it, is cen&s;ured and condem|ned; and not meerly the ab&s;ence of natural affection. Therefore it does by no means follow from &s;uch an expre&s;&s;ion that the exerci&s;e of natural affection is required, and is a duty.</P>
<P N="6">VI. <HI>Another</HI> argument which Mr. M. offers in favor of commands to the unregenerate duties is, that if there are no &s;uch commands &amp; they have no duty to do while impenitent enemies to God, then nothing is required of them, they are left without any law or re&s;traint, to indulge their lu&s;ts as they plea&s;e, without any motive or encouragement to the contrary, and to attend on the means of grace. This leaves &s;inners at liberty, and they have nothing to do. He &s;ays, that upon the principle he is oppo&s;ing, <Q>the unregenerate while &s;uch, are not required to pray at all; and by parity of rea&s;on, not required to attend any other duty, &s;ince they can no more perform them in a gracious manner than they can prayer. And therefore, according to this principle, are <HI>in no &s;en&s;e</HI> re|quired to perform them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 107.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>And again he &s;ays, it <Q>takes off all re&s;traint from the unregenerate, and opens a floodgate to all manner of iniquity.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 117, 118.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>I would ob&s;erve here, that when he &s;ays, the unregenerate, while &s;uch, are not required to pray at all, and are <HI>in no &s;en&s;e</HI> required to per|form any duty, he cannot mean that they are not required to pray <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> impenitents, and do unregenerate duties; for this would be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> no|thing at all. The principle he is oppo&s;ing is, that nothing is required of men at duty which they do while unregenerate. And if this is all he means to a&s;&s;ert in the&s;e words, they are no more than to &s;ay, <Q>If unre|generate duties are not required, then unregenerate duties are not re|quired;</Q> which is to &s;ay nothing. What he here &s;ays, he infers as a con&s;equence from the principle, that no unregenerate duties are required, as an argument again&s;t it. But the principle it&s;elf is no con&s;equence from it&s;elf, or argument again&s;t it; for this is only to &s;ay, if the principle is true, it is indeed true. Ju&s;t as if I &s;hould undertake to prove I am not now writing again&s;t Mr. M. in oppo&s;ition to &s;ome one who had &s;aid I was, by &s;aying, this cannot be true, for from this principle it will fol|low, that I am writing again&s;t Mr. M.&mdash;Be&s;ides, Mr. M. here &s;ays, that according to this principle they are <HI>in no &s;en&s;e</HI> required to do any duty; which denies that they are under any command to do any duty, if not required to do unregenerate duty.</P>
<P>Mr. M. &s;ays things to the &s;ame purpo&s;e in many other places of his book; I will mention but one; which is in the following words, <Q>And if this perver&s;ion, which, is here given of this text, <HI>&s;trive to enter,</HI> &amp;c. &s;hould be received for truth, I cannot but think it would have a very bad

tendency to increa&s;e &s;ecurity and negligence about religion, and open profanene&s;s among the unregenerate. If this text does not re&s;pect the unconverted, and enjoin duties upon them, where can there be a|ny pa&s;&s;age found in the bible that has any reference to them? Let this author produce &s;ome divine law, requiring the duties, endeavours and exerci&s;es of the unregenerate, or &s;ay plainly, <HI>there is nothing required of them in this &s;tate.</HI><NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">P. 50, 51.</NOTE></Q> Here we &s;ee he &s;uppo&s;es that if any text does not require unregenerate duties, and enjoin &s;omething to be done by man while impenitent, <HI>it has no re&s;pect to the unconverted,</HI> nor <HI>enjoins any duty upon them:</HI> And that there is no medium with him between their being required to do unregenerate duties, and nothing being required of them: And that in this view to deny that unregenerate duties are required, <Q>has a very bad tendency to increa&s;e &s;ecurity and negligence about religion, and open profanene&s;s among the unregenerate.</Q> Here I would ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1. It is not true that if nothing is required of the unregenerate, which they will do while in that &s;tate, then nothing is required of them in any &s;en&s;e. It has been before ob&s;erved, that they are as much under law as the regenerate, and required to practi&s;e godline&s;s and humanity, in the exerci&s;e of love to God and their neighbour. They cannot be excu&s;ed from this, and m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t be wholly to blame for every in&s;tance, and each de|gree of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and every thing in them that oppo&s;es it; unle&s;s a per&s;on's having no inclination to that which is mo&s;t rea&s;onable, and a &s;trong, fixed oppo&s;ition of bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to it, removes all obligation, and takes off all blame in neglecting and oppo&s;ing it. And if &s;o, (then there is no &s;uch thing as blame in the univer&s;e; nor any &s;uch thing as law and moral government. For according to this, no per&s;on can be obliged to any thing which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> not inclined to do. Therefore he can be under no law but his own inclination and will; nor in the lea&s;t to blame while he follows this, which every one always does.</P>
<P>Mr. M. does repeatedly a&s;&s;ert that the unregenerate are required to be holy, and to do duty in a right and holy manner. But he &s;eems in the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages mentioned, and others, to forget all this, and take it for grant|ed that the contrary is true, el&s;e he never could have expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf as he has. And I appeal to the judicious reader to judge, whether his whole book does not owe its exi&s;tence, to his latent maxim in favor of the unregenerate, viz. That they cannot be required to do any thing which they may not do in a &s;tate of unregeneracy, &s;o are to blame only for the neglect of &s;uch duties, and for walking in tho&s;e ways that are con|trary to them; this being the maxim he builds all upon, tho' he has &s;ometimes a&s;&s;erted the contrary.</P>
<P N="2">2. This being the ca&s;e, every thing being required of the unregene|rate that is in it&s;elf de&s;irable, good and excellent, and urged with pro|mi&s;es of the greate&s;t good, even of eternal life, if they hearken and com|ply with the lea&s;t degree of &s;incerity; and with the mo&s;t awful threat|enings of eternal de&s;truction, if they ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;t in impenitence and rebellion; nothing can be more &s;uited to awaken and alarm them, to deter them from &s;in, and excite them to duty. Never did a per&s;on believe and realize this, and yet continue in open profanene&s;s or &s;ecu|rity.
<PB N="148" REF="011295_0078_0F869F216487E208">
And if the&s;e truths are kept out of view, nothing remains by which the &s;inner can be convinced of his true &s;tate, and thoroughly a|wakened. How then could Mr. M. imagine that to preach this to the unregenerate, with all that is implied in it, and nothing el&s;e, "would have a very bad tendency to increa&s;e &s;ecurity and negligence in religion, and open profanene&s;s among the unregenerate?" It is mo&s;t certain that if this is left out of view, and nothing but unregenerate duties are preached up, not one &s;inner will be awakened &amp; convinced. And if they are preached up, as they often are, &amp; as Mr. M. does, (at lea&s;t in his book) as being that in which the duty of the unregenerate principally, if not wholly con&s;i&s;ts, and that their &s;in chiefly lies in the neglect of them, they being not much if at all to blame for not loving God and not embracing the go&s;pel; it has the greate&s;t tendency to keep &s;inners in ignorance, &s;ecurity ea&s;e; and if it does not make them negligent of all religion, it tends to lead them to neglect and oppo&s;e all true religion.</P>
<P>Mr. M. and they who join with him, are wi&s;er than John the Bap|ti&s;t; &amp; if he was wi&s;e and right in his way of preaching, they are not &s;o. He &s;aid not a word of unregenerate duties, but preached and in|culcated nothing &s;hort of repentance, true repentance,&mdash;that repen|tance with which the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;in was connected,<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Luk. III. 3.</NOTE> that repentance which implied a preparedne&s;s of heart to receive and believe on Chri&s;t, when he &s;hould be revealed.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Act. XIX. 4.</NOTE> He required of all his hearers <HI>good fruit,</HI> fruits meet for repentance, on pain of eternal damnation,<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Luk. III. 8, 9, 17.</NOTE> and &s;aid not a word to them of any doings &s;hort of this, even repentance and faith on him who &s;hould come after him. Indeed, when he was a&s;ked by per&s;ons what they &s;hould do in order to conduct as penitents<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> what fruits they ought to bring forth, which were meet for repentance, and a proper manife&s;tation of it? he told them what external conduct they mu&s;t go into, in order to this,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luk. III. 10,&mdash;14.</NOTE> But this was not directing them to impenitent unregenerate doings, but pointing out the exerci&s;e and fruits of that repentance, which he required.</P>
<P>And had this preaching any tendency to &s;ecurity and open profane|ne&s;s? Did this "take off all re&s;traint from the unregenerate, and o|pen a flood-gate to all manner of iniquity?" No; quite the rever&s;e.

this had more of a tendency to awaken the &s;ervant to a &s;en&s;e of the evil ca&s;e he was in, or promote his return? Would it not be the mo&s;t proper, and likelie&s;t way to rou&s;e the attention of the &s;ervant, and pre|vent his going off yet further, to keep up the ma&s;ter's demand, and &s;hew the unrea&s;onablene&s;s and crime of refu&s;ing to comply;&mdash;the hap|py con&s;equences of his returning, and the dreadful evil that a refu&s;al would bring upon him, &amp;c.?

<P N="3">3. If the &s;inner did his duty while he continued a perfectly impenitent enemy to God and the Saviour in attending on means, &amp;c. and he is told that God commands him to do the&s;e things with &s;uch a heart as he has, &s;eeing he is unwilling to repent and return to God, and ob&s;tinately oppo&s;es it; and he &s;hould be urged to do them from this con&s;ideration; it would not have the lea&s;t influence upon him, or be any motive to him to comply. The &s;inner has no regard to duty, as &s;uch, and is not in|clined to do any thing merely becau&s;e it is duty: this will never be a motive with him to take one &s;tep, or to exert him&s;elf &s;o much as to lift up a finger. So far as he is influenced by this con&s;ideration, he is not an impenitent; but has true re&s;pect and love to God, and is di&s;po&s;ed to return to him and embrace the go&s;pel. He is, by the &s;uppo&s;ition, only &s;eeking his own intere&s;t, and cares nothing about God or duty to him, in them&s;elves con&s;idered, and for their own &s;ake; if he does, the point is gained, and it will be enough to tell him, it is his duty to repent and believe on Chri&s;t, and there will be no need to devi&s;e a lower &s;et of duties for him which he may do merely from a principle of &s;elf-love, and as an enemy to God, could there be any &s;uch duty: for this is at bot|tom to urge him to do duty, not becau&s;e it is his duty, and without any regard to it as &s;uch. There is therefore a plain contradiction and ab|&s;urdity, in the very propo&s;al. The per&s;on is &s;uppo&s;ed, and known to have no regard to his duty, and to care nothing about it, as &s;uch; if he had, it would be enough to tell him, it is his indi&s;pen&s;able duty to love God and embrace the go&s;pel. But while he has no regard to this, he will be influenced and governed by &s;ome other motive in all he does, and not at all by this. Nothing but a principle of &s;elf-love can be applied to in this ca&s;e, which has no regard to duty, as &s;uch; but his own in|tere&s;t. If he can be thoroughly and feelingly convinced that it is for his own intere&s;t to avoid one thing and do another, this will be a forcible and &s;ufficient motive to induce him to do it. But if not, and it &s;eems to him to be for his own intere&s;t to act contrary to duty, he will pay no regard at all to the command, how much &s;oever it is urged upon him; it is quite equal with him whether he does his duty, or not. He can no more be influenced or bound by obligation and duty, than the man po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed with devils could be re&s;trained and confined with fetters and chains. He will break all the&s;e bands; however great and &s;trong they are, he will e&s;teem them as &s;traw and rotten-wood.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="011295_0079_0F869F21F6CE9BF0">As the unregenerate are wholly under the influence of &s;elf-love, and &s;eek their own intere&s;t only, they regard duty only as it does, in their view, tend to their own intere&s;t. And in this view they may have a &s;ort of de&s;ire to do their duty, as the mo&s;t likely way to e&s;cape evil, and obtain the good they want. But however high their regard to duty in this &s;en&s;e ri&s;es, they yet have no regard to it for its own &s;ake, or con&s;|idered meerly as duty; but purely for their own &s;akes, as they con&s;ider their own intere&s;t to be connected with it. If therefore it is for the high|e&s;t intere&s;t of the unregenerate to avoid all open vice, and diligently attend on the means of grace, it being the only likely way to e&s;cape eternal de&s;truction, and attain endle&s;s happine&s;s, and they can be tho|roughly convinced of this, it will be the greate&s;t, and <HI>only</HI> motive that can be &s;et before them to induce them to this, and will certainly and effectually influence them: And the con&s;ideration that this is their duty, if it was &s;o, would not add the lea&s;t grain to the motive. It is a matter of perfect indifference with them whether it is duty, or &s;in, if they may an&s;wer their own ends by it, and promote their own intere&s;t.</P>
<P>God knew this to be the &s;tate of the &s;inner, and has &s;o contrived and &s;uited things to this, in the revelation he has given, without &s;aying a word to them of doing any duty while they continue impenitent, that as &s;oon as their con&s;ciences are awakened, and they begin to &s;ee in what a &s;tate they are, they will for&s;ake the cour&s;es of the &s;ecure profligate, and attend on the means of grace.</P>
<P>Mr. M. and others have in their great wi&s;dom devi&s;ed another me|thod of treating with &s;inners, by trying to per&s;uade them to do their duty while perfect enemies to God, if they had a true regard for their duty, and de&s;ire to do it for its own &s;ake; when their unregeneracy and all their &s;infulne&s;s con&s;i&s;ts, in the want of &s;uch regard to duty, and oppo&s;iti|on of heart to it. In this they are therefore guilty of the ab&s;urdity of &s;uppo&s;ing &s;inners have &s;ome true re&s;pect to God, that is, &s;ome true love to him, and his law, while they are ob&s;tinate and perfect enemies to him, and have never had the lea&s;t degree of repentance of any of their rebel|lion. And this way of treating &s;inners, is &s;o far from having any ten|dency to their good, that it tends to keep them in ignorance and &s;ecuri|ty, and always has this effect where there is nothing to prevent its genu|ine influence.</P>
<P>BEFORE I end this &s;ection, I would ob&s;erve the phra&s;e, <HI>con&s;cientious per|formance of duty,</HI> which Mr. M. u&s;es &s;o often with re&s;pect to the unregene|rate, and the regenerate, when they have no grace, or are not in the ex|erci&s;e of it, is very ambiguous, and tends to give a wrong idea of the ca&s;e. I think the natural and proper import of the phra&s;e is, a perform|ance of duty in &s;incerity and out of true re&s;pect to the duty as command|ed. If he who is only an eye &s;ervant, and has no true re&s;pect to his ma&s;ter, but hates him and his &s;ervice, behaves obediently in his ma&s;ter's pre&s;ence, merely becau&s;e he is in his ma&s;ter's hands, and fears his di&s;|plea&s;ure and the red; no one perhaps will think this may be properly called, a <HI>con&s;cientious performance of duty.</HI> But this is as properly and as much &s;o, as the be&s;t performances of the unregenerate, or of the regene|rate

who&s;e grace wholly fails them, if any &s;uch there are. If Mr. M. in|tends any more by this phra&s;e, which I conclude he does, he has only im|po&s;ed on him&s;elf and his reader. Men may act agreeable to their con&s;cien|ces, i.e. not know that what they do is contrary to the command, but think they are doing what is right, as Saul did when he per&s;ecuted the church; and yet not come up to the con&s;cientious performance of duty, any more than the &s;ervant ju&s;t mentioned, if they act from the &s;ame principles.</P>

They appeared to have a new heart, humble, penitent, obedient heart, while they confe&s;&s;ed their &s;ins and earne&s;tly enquired and &s;ought of God the deliverance they wanted. There were propably many, even <HI>great numbers</HI> of true penitents; the&s;e with the re&s;t of the people, who were reformed and in profe&s;&s;ion true pe|nitents, were the <HI>hou&s;e of I&s;rael,</HI> who enquired of God, and earne&s;tly and &s;olemnly be&s;ought him (the godly with true &s;incerity, and the re&s;t only in appearance) to return their captivity, deliver them from their di&s;tre&s;&s;es, &amp;c. This leads me to ob&s;erve another gro&s;s mi&s;take Mr. M. has made here.

<P>He &s;uppo&s;es the prayers and &s;eeking of the unregenerate are &s;poken of in the following words, "I have &s;urely heard Ephraim bemoaning him&s;elf thus.

<P N="1">1.

And being quite reconciled to turning to God, and having a very good will in the matter, he cries to God to do that for him, which he cannot do him&s;elf, how|ever well di&s;po&s;ed he is towards it. This is the light in which many &s;et the unregenerate who are awakened to a concern about their eternal in|tere&s;t, and in which multitudes view them&s;elves, and imagine they are doing their utmo&s;t and crying to God, to do that for them, which they are quite willing, and would be glad with all their hearts to do, but it is utterly beyond their power. It is impo&s;&s;ible that the &s;inner who has this notion of him&s;elf, &s;hould feel him&s;elf wholly to blame for not turning to God, and be &s;en&s;ible that not embracing the go&s;pel is the greate&s;t of all &s;ins, or that he de&s;erves to be damned for it</P>
<P>The unregenerate &s;inner is &s;o far from being of this character, that he is properly repre&s;ented by the foregoing words, "Thou ha&s;t cha&s;ti&s;ed me, and I was cha&s;ti&s;ed <HI>as a bullock unaccu&s;tomed to the yoke.</HI>" The un|regenerate &s;inner is always like a bullock unaccu&s;tomed to the yoke,

who will not &s;ubmit to the hand of his ma&s;ter, but is perfectly untoward and oppo&s;ite, and only attempts to get out of his hands. But as &s;oon as he comes to a better mind, and has a new heart, he condemns and be|moans him&s;elf, and &s;en&s;ible of his perver&s;ene&s;s, and the oppo&s;ition of his heart to God, he heartily cries, "Turn thou me, and I &s;hall be turned." This is the prayer of a regenerate &s;inner, &s;ubmitting to God, after a cour&s;e of ob&s;tinate rebellion, and feeling his own perver&s;ene&s;s, and de|pendence on God for all moral good, as no unregenerate &s;inner ever did.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould be &s;aid, the regenerate are turned already, why &s;hould they pray to God to turn them? I an&s;wer, they are turned in a low and imperfect degree, and now &s;ee un&s;peakably more of the perver&s;ene&s;s and ob&s;tinacy of their hearts than ever an unregenerate per&s;on did. They need the continuance of the influence which has changed their hearts in &s;ome degree, and to be turned more and more. Thus David prays, long after he was a good man, "Create in me a clean heart, O God, and re|new a right &s;pirit within me."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. LI. 10.</NOTE> The chri&s;tian needs to be turned, as really as any other man, and &s;ees his need of it more, and heartily de|&s;ires it. Why then &s;hould he not pray for it? Would Mr. M. or any other man, think it improper and &s;trange, if he &s;hould hear a number of profe&s;&s;ed chri&s;tians u&s;e this expre&s;&s;ion in prayer, "Turn us, and we &s;hall be turned"? Has he not u&s;ed it, or expre&s;&s;ions of the &s;ame import, times without number?</P>
<P>Mr. M. &s;ays, <Q>He is repre&s;ented as converted, while he &s;tands praying for it, as is <HI>inconte&s;tibly</HI> clear from the following words, <HI>For thou art the Lord my God,</HI> &s;urely after that I was turned I repented, and after I was in&s;tructed, I &s;mote upon my thigh, &amp;c.</Q> The whole that Ephraim is repre&s;ented as &s;aying here appears to be one continued addre&s;s to God, which may be di&s;tinctly read over in le&s;s than half a minute. It is but two &s;entences; the petition "turn thou me" is urged by this argu|ment. "For thou art the Lord my God." Surely this is not the language of the unregenerate. He then proceeds to &s;peak of the change that had pa&s;&s;ed upon him, &s;ince he was as a bullock unaccu&s;tomed to the yoke, and was the ground of his coming to God with this humble petition as he now does, and is a repre&s;entation of the temper of mind with which he now addre&s;&s;ed God. He, crying to God with this temper of mind, as a friend to his character, and a penitent, returning &s;inner, is accepted and obtains favor: God immediately &s;ays, "I will &s;urely have mercy upon him." Mr. M. in order to make it <HI>inconte&s;tibly clear</HI> that he was converted while he &s;tood praying, takes part of the fir&s;t &s;entence, which is the rea&s;on and argument with which the petition is urged, "For thou art the Lord my God," and adds it to the next &s;entence; becau&s;e it would not do to put the&s;e words into the mouth of an unregenerate &s;in|ner: by which he has broken and &s;poiled the &s;en&s;e of the whole. If he "is repre&s;ented as converted while he &s;tands praying for it," he was converted in the middle of a &s;entence. He &s;aid "Turn thou me, and I &s;hall be turned." And then &s;topped, becau&s;e he could go no further while unconverted; and when he got converted, he fini&s;hes the &s;entence

he had began, and urges the petition he had made in an unconverted &s;tate, by an argument be could not u&s;e while unconverted; which peti|tion was granted before he mentioned the argument. He therefore u&s;ed the argument when there was no need of it or of &s;o much as making the petition; for he had already got what he a&s;ked for. If he could not make this petition after he was converted, how could he after this back it up, and plead to have it granted, even immediately upon its being granted?&mdash;I was agoing to &s;ay what I think is <HI>inconte&s;tibly clear</HI>&mdash;But I forbear, and leave it to the reader.</P>
<P>I WOULD make a brief remark upon what he &s;ays on the prodigal. He &s;uppo&s;es his coming to him&s;elf, and con&s;equently &s;eeing that there was bread enough and to &s;pare in his father's hou&s;e, and re&s;olving to go and confe&s;s his &s;ins to his father and a&s;k admi&s;&s;ion into his hou&s;e; and his actually doing this, is de&s;igned to repre&s;ent the unregenerate under convictions. His words are, <Q>He now began to be in want, felt him&s;elf in a fami&s;hing condition for want of bread: this put him in earne&s;t upon thinking what he had done; and as all hope of relief that now remained was from his father; he earne&s;tly looked out for help in this way, and found relief. All this is a lively repre&s;entation of the &s;inner's being brought to a feeling &s;en&s;e of his peri&s;hing want of the bread of life, and that God only has it in his power to be&s;tow: and therefore will grant earne&s;tne&s;s to look to God for it, as one that &s;eeks bread, when life is at &s;take.<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">P. 79.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Here he makes the unregenerate &s;inner, who is under the dominion of his lu&s;ts, an enemy to God and the Saviour, and &s;o blind that the go&s;pel is hid from him: he makes &s;uch an one, I &s;ay, to have his eyes opened to &s;ee the wonderful fullne&s;s there is in Chri&s;t for &s;inners, and to de&s;ire and long for a &s;hare in it, as a hungry man longs for bread; to look to God, and actually go to him for it; loathing him&s;elf for his &s;ins, and earne&s;tly longing to be God's &s;ervant, and dwell in his family. In &s;hort, he makes the unregenerate &s;inner come up to every thing which is ne|ce&s;&s;ary in order to his finding mercy, according to Chri&s;t's repre&s;entation of the matter by the prodigal; and all that to which the promi&s;es of God's favor are every where made in the go&s;pel. And Mr. M. may be challenged to tell what more ever takes place in a &s;inner, in order to his finding mercy, than he here &s;ays the unregenerate come to. We there|fore here &s;ee again what little rea&s;on Mr. M. had to thank me for prov|ing that there are no promi&s;es to the doings of the unregenerate; and that all I &s;aid to prove this, is, as it con&s;i&s;tent with his notion of the character and doings of &s;uch as it is with Dr. Mayhew's; and as is any thing contained in my &s;ection on means. No &s;uch thing can be proved con&s;i&s;tently with what he &s;ays here, and in many other places: But the contrary is the undeniable con&s;equence.</P>
<P>The prodigal in all he did alter he began to be in want, till he came to him&s;elf, repre&s;ents an unregenerate &s;inner, under awakenings and con|victions of con&s;cience. In this &s;tate he took methods to help him&s;elf, which were vain and wholly failed him: But had not the lea&s;t inclinati|on
<PB N="155" REF="011295_0081_0F869F238B51A0F8">
of returning to his father's hou&s;e. This blinded him to the fullne&s;s of it, and the de&s;irablene&s;s of dwelling there. This is a &s;hort but true and &s;triking repre&s;entation of the &s;tate of the unregenerate, what|ever awakenings and convictions they are under. They begin to be in want; they feel them&s;elves in a mi&s;erable, peri&s;hing &s;tate; and this is the &s;ole ground of all their unea&s;ine&s;s and exerci&s;es. They ari&s;e and exert them&s;elves, but &s;pend their money for that which is not bread, and their labour for that which &s;atisfieth not.<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. LV. 2.</NOTE> They &s;ee not their true &s;infulne&s;s and unworthine&s;s; &s;o do not confe&s;s. They have not the lea&s;t inclination to return home to God, however pinched they may be on every &s;ide with a &s;en&s;e of their own want. But as &s;oon as they have a new heart, their eyes are opened, and they come to them&s;elves; they &s;ee what fools they have been: what guilty wretches they are; what full and rich provi&s;ion is made for the mo&s;t wretched and vile in Chri&s;t the Mediator, and in the&s;e views, return home to God, and as humble penitents fly for refuge to &s;overeign mercy.</P>
<P>It is plain therefore that our Saviour intended to repre&s;ent the un|regenerate &s;inner by the prodigal, when he came to him&s;elf, &amp;c. And we have rea&s;on to admire the preci&s;ion and clearne&s;s of the repre&s;enta|tion he here makes. None but a teacher &s;ent from God could have &s;poken the&s;e words. But they never were under&s;tood nor can be, by tho&s;e who differ from this divine teacher in their notions of the cha|racter of the unregenerate as much as Mr. M. appears to do. And, by the way, if Mr. M. had no better notion of the unregenerate, con|vinced &s;inner, than is given in this parable, by the prodigal before he came to him&s;elf, he would never have thought of his growing &s;o much better, or le&s;s &s;inful; nor been &s;o much offended at his being &s;et in &s;o bad a light in my &s;ection on means.</P>
<P>But Mr. M. has made more &s;ad work yet, I think, in what he &s;ays on the parable of the phari&s;ee and publican.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luk. XVIII. 9,&mdash;14.</NOTE> He &s;ays our Saviour in the publican meant to give the character of an awakened, convinced, unconverted &s;inner, in di&s;tinction from a proud, &s;tupid, &s;elf-righteous &s;inner; and takes con&s;iderable pains to prove it.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 79,&mdash;82.</NOTE></P>
<P>Our divine teacher in this &s;hort parable exhibits two different and oppo&s;ite characters, in which the exerci&s;es and character of the true Chri&s;tian are in a very clear and &s;triking manner expre&s;&s;ed, in op|po&s;ition to all other religious exerci&s;es and characters on earth. In the publican we have the character which is repre&s;ented through the Old Te&s;tament, as the di&s;tingui&s;hing character of the godly, to whom promi&s;es of the divine favour are con&s;tantly made. Confe&s;&s;ion of &s;in is repre&s;ented as peculiar to tho&s;e who find mercy.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prov. XXVIII. 13. P&s;al.

CXLVII. 11.</NOTE> All this is expre&s;&s;ed in the publican's prayer, "God be merciful to me a &s;inner." It is not po&s;&s;ible for a man to &s;ay the&s;e words, con&s;idered in their proper &s;en&s;e and latitude, under&s;tandingly and heartily, unle&s;s he is a true penitent, and in a true &s;en&s;e of what &s;in is, and what it de&s;erves, with a humble, broken, contrite heart, flies to the &s;overeign mercy of God, as revealed and offered to &s;inners in divine revelation, and makes this his only hope and refuge. And in this are &s;ummarily compre|hended all the exerci&s;es of true Chri&s;tian piety. What is expre&s;&s;ed in the&s;e words "God be merciful to me, a &s;inner," is the very &s;oul and &s;pirit of the fifty-fir&s;t P&s;alm, in which not an unregenerate &s;inner, but DAVID, an eminent &s;aint, expre&s;&s;es the humble, penitent, pious &s;en|timents of his heart. This p&s;alm is, as it were, epitomi&s;ed, with &s;o much judgment and preci&s;ion, and the very &s;pirit of true piety, as re|vealed through the whole of the Old Te&s;tament, is &s;o comprehen&s;ive|ly &s;ummed up in this &s;hort &s;entence, which Chri&s;t puts into the mouth of the publican, that it is one &s;tanding evidence, among ten thou&s;and others, that he was a divine teacher. No man, unle&s;s divinely in|&s;pired, would ever have tho't of thus di&s;tingui&s;hing all true piety from that which is not &s;o.</P>
<P>But &s;o great is the blindne&s;s of men, &s;uch are their prejudices, that when this is done to their hand by him who &s;pake as never man &s;pake, they overlook all the in&s;truction that is given, and cannot &s;ee any part of the character of the godly, or the lea&s;t expre&s;&s;ion of true piety in the words. But think they rather expre&s;s the heart of a friend to &s;in, an enemy to God, and an ob&s;tinate oppo&s;er of his wonderful mercy of|fered to &s;inners in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Who would expect to find Mr. M. among the&s;e, who has had &s;o long a time, and been under &s;o many advantages to find out what is the &s;pirit of true Chri&s;tian piety, and what are the exerci&s;es of the &s;aint in his approaches to God?</P>
<P>But let us attend to the rea&s;ons he gives again&s;t the meaning and de|&s;ign of this parable, which I have endeavoured briefly to e&s;tabli&s;h, and in favour of his own.</P>
<P N="1">1. He &s;ays "there does not appear any thing in the publican's prayer conclu&s;ive of his being a &s;aint, no di&s;tingui&s;hing character of a &s;aint." I am &s;orry this did not <HI>appear</HI> to him, &s;ince I am &s;ure nothing but prejudice or &s;ome wor&s;e cau&s;e could prevent it. But enough of this before.</P>
<P N="2">2. He queries what in&s;truction is here given worthy of a divine tea|cher, if the parable is under&s;tood in the &s;en&s;e he oppo&s;es? "Is it that the prayer of a &s;aint, put up in faith, is more acceptable to God than the prayer of one of the vile&s;t &s;inners upon earth?"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>WHY was the phari&s;ee one of the greate&s;t &s;inners on earth?

ANS The in&s;truction given is very great, and mo&s;t important and intere&s;ting. It does not teach us indeed, what prayer is mo&s;t accept|able and plea&s;ing to God for it's own &s;ake, or con&s;idered in it&s;elf; for in this re&s;pect all &s;inners are perfectly on a level, and the holie&s;t prayer is no more acceptable than any other. The holie&s;t &s;aint that ever was, is no more acceptable to God in his per&s;on or offerings, than the vile&s;t &s;inner on earth, con&s;idered in any other view than as united to Chri&s;t, and tru&s;ting in his merit and righteou&s;ne&s;s alone to recommend his per&s;on and offerings; for both are, in any other view under the cur&s;e of God, and proper objects of the divine di&s;plea&s;ure and abhorrence. But our divine teacher here tells us, in a very plain, familiar, &s;triking way and manner, what is that character, and what are tho&s;e exerci&s;es in which the &s;inner comes to God, &s;o as to find ac|ceptance and obtain mercy through a Mediator, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from every character, and all the exerci&s;es which fail of this. Or with what temper and exerci&s;es the true Chri&s;tian draws near to God, and lives by faith in Chri&s;t, from fir&s;t to la&s;t; and in what true Chri&s;tian humility and piety con&s;i&s;ts, as it is di&s;tingui&s;hed from every thing el&s;e, and points out the only way to heaven, in di&s;tinction from all by-paths. This I endeavoured briefly to illu&s;trate ju&s;t now. Wo to him who has not yet this in&s;truction, either from this, or &s;ome other pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture.</P>
<P N="3">3. He a&s;ks "Is this the whole truth? Does it agree with the &s;cripture account in general, of the difference between a &s;aint and a &s;inner?" What has been &s;aid before is an an&s;wer to this. And it is not a little &s;urprizing that &s;uch a que&s;tion could be a&s;ked. But the next words are more &s;hocking &s;till. <Q>Is it not the character of a &s;aint to lift up his eyes with his heart to God in prayer; to draw near with full a&s;&s;urance of faith, and come boldly to a throne of grace? All which are directly the rever&s;e to the character here given to the poor, dejected publican.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="011295_0083_0F869F29B4CC1D00">ANS. The publican had a great degree of the a&s;&s;urance of faith' which con&s;i&s;ted in tru&s;ting in the mercy of God, while his great &s;in|fulne&s;s was in full view. There is no true a&s;&s;urance of faith but this. And he was bold indeed to come to God for mercy, and make this his only refuge, bringing nothing in him&s;elf but &s;in, and a clear and affecting view of his amazing, infinite guilt &amp; vilene&s;s. This is all the true Chri&s;tian boldne&s;s that ever any one had or exerci&s;ed in coming to the throne of grace.

I am confi|dent he had that very boldne&s;s which Mr. M. means by Chri&s;tian boldne&s;s, &s;o far as his idea of it differs from that which appears in the publican. And I know not why Mr. M. cannot well &s;ay and do ju&s;t as the phari&s;ee did; only <HI>call</HI> it <HI>humble boldne&s;s,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>proud boa&s;ting.</HI> The publican is &s;aid not &s;o much as to lift up his eyes to heaven, not to denote <HI>dejection,</HI> but humility and faith, in oppo&s;ition to the pride and boldne&s;s of the phari&s;ee; even that chri&s;tian humility, without which, there is no true confidence and boldne&s;s at the throne of grace.</P>
<P>It is to be hoped that Mr. M. daily makes this prayer &amp; comes to the throne of grace with that very faith and boldne&s;s, which is recommend|ed in the character of the publican, and that he has been advancing in this for many years, however unaccountably he has overlooked it on this occa&s;ion, and wrote in &s;uch a manner, that I know not how the humble chri&s;tian can read it, and enter into the true &s;pirit of it without being &s;urprized and &s;hocked in a manner that is not ea&s;ily expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P N="4">4. He &s;ays, tho' "This man went down to his hou&s;e ju&s;tified," i. e. actually accepted and pardoned, it does not follow that he was &s;o when he prayed; but he might be converted &s;oon after, even before he got down to his hou&s;e. This is therefore no evidence that he did not make an unconverted prayer; and is &s;o far from be|ing again&s;t his &s;en&s;e of the parable, that it &s;trongly &s;upports it, and &s;hews the efficacy and &s;ucce&s;s of the prayers of the unconverted; &s;o is an in&s;tance more to his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>ANS. Chri&s;t here exhibits a character in the publican, and the&s;e words are predicated of this character, and nothing el&s;e, and are the mo&s;t ex|pre&s;s a&s;&s;ertion, that they who have <HI>this character</HI> are accepted and ju&s;ti|fied. And they who, becau&s;e they like not this character, will ima|gine and form another, quite different one, about which, Chri&s;t &s;ays not one word, and apply the&s;e words to that, are very pre&s;umptuous, and &s;et their own wi&s;dom up above that of a divine Teacher. They who take this liberty will make wild &s;teerage indeed!</P>
<P>The words immediately following, which Mr. M. has entirely neglected,
<PB N="159" REF="011295_0083_0F869F29B4CC1D00">
are worthy of particular notice. "<HI>For</HI> every one that exalteth him&s;elf, &s;hall be aba&s;ed; and every one that <HI>humbleth</HI> him&s;elf &s;hall be exalted." The&s;e words fix the &s;en&s;e of the parable, if nothing el&s;e did. The phari&s;ee exalted him&s;elf; the publican humbled him&s;elf; therefore was ju&s;tified, and exalted. Here Chri&s;t does in the mo&s;t ex|pre&s;s manner declare that all who are of the character exhibited in the publican, and do as he did, do humble them&s;elves, and &s;hall be exalt|ed. Here then Mr. M. has again found an ab&s;olute promi&s;e of &s;alva|tion, to his <HI>humble,</HI> unregenerate &s;inner; and mu&s;t according to his in|terpretation hold to &s;uch promi&s;es. We might from this, and other in&s;tances of the like kind, &s;afely conclude he had renounced the book he formerly wrote to prove the contrary, had he not mentioned it in his preface to this with approbation, and thanked me for e&s;pou&s;ing the &s;ame cau&s;e, and fini&s;hing the debate. But as the ca&s;e now &s;tands, it is a glaring in&s;tance, among many others of the mo&s;t gro&s;s incon&s;i&s;t|ence with him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mr. M. thro' his whole book, and in the pa&s;&s;age I am now upon, frequently &s;peaks of his awakened &s;inner, as the <HI>humble</HI> &s;inner, and often as <HI>legally humbled.</HI> This is not a &s;cripture expre&s;&s;ion, and it is difficult to know what he means by it, unle&s;s it be true humility, or el&s;e &s;omething directly contrary to it. The &s;cripture every where &s;peaks of the <HI>humble</HI> per&s;on, as one who by his humility is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the ungodly, and as one who is intere&s;ted in God's favor, as our Saviour does in the words under con&s;ideration.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ahab and Rehoboam and the princes of I&s;rael are &s;aid to <HI>humble them&s;elves.</HI> 2 Chron. XII. 6, 7. But this has reference only to their external conduct; the appearance and profe&s;&s;ion of true humility which they put on, and not to any thing in their hearts. If they had really and heartily humbled them&s;elves, they would have been exalted and &s;aved forever: But as they did this only externally, God gave them, an an&s;werable external deliverance, and that only.</NOTE></P>
<P>I PASS to another pa&s;&s;age in this remarkable <HI>note.</HI> Mr. M under|takes to repre&s;ent the &s;tate of an unregenerate &s;inner, with re&s;pect to his de&s;ires of the &s;alvation offered in the go&s;pel, by a per&s;on who has a mortification, &s;o that it is nece&s;&s;ary the limb &s;hould be cut off in order to &s;ave his life. In this ca&s;e, from his love and de&s;ire of life, he on the whole, earne&s;tly de&s;ires, and cheerfully &s;ubmits to the operation.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 88, 89.</NOTE> This, Mr. M. &s;ays, is "a plain &s;imile." I an&s;wer, it is not &s;o, nor at all to the purpo&s;e, unle&s;s the unregenerate do on the whole de&s;ire the &s;alvation which the go&s;pel offers: yea, de&s;ire it as a man, in danger of death, de&s;ires life, and do cheerfully &s;ubmit to the terms of &s;alvati|on, and actually choo&s;e and embrace Chri&s;t and his righteou&s;ne&s;s as offered in the go&s;pel, in order to e&s;cape damnation.</P>
<P>MR. MILLS's notion of faith, is, I think, worthy of &s;pecial remark. He does not undertake to de&s;cribe faith, and particularly &s;hew what it is: but he repeatedly &s;ugge&s;ts what may lead us to his notion of it.
<PB N="160" REF="011295_0084_0F869F2A818E73E8">
He, &s;peaking of per&s;ons in&s;i&s;ting that the unregenerate are required to pray in faith, adds, <Q>A thing as impo&s;&s;ible in nature, as for the &s;ame thing to be, and not to be at the &s;ame time; not only becau&s;e faith implies regeneration, but al&s;o <HI>becau&s;e there is no promi&s;e for the unre|generate to ground their faith upon,</HI> as the author has abundantly proved.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">P. 42.</NOTE></Q> And again, &s;peaking of the &s;ame thing, he &s;ays, <Q>Be&s;ides, what have the unregenerate, while &s;uch, to ground an act of faith in prayer upon? &s;ince, as the author hath well proved, they have no title to any of the promi&s;es.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 94.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>What is faith, then, according to him? why plainly this, a pe&s;on's really believing that God has promi&s;ed life &amp; &s;alvation to him, or that he has an intere&s;t in the divine promi&s;es: for if faith was any thing el&s;e but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, a per&s;on might believe before he has any promi&s;e made to him, or is intere&s;ted in any promi&s;e; which Mr. M. here &s;ays he cannot, and that it is as impo&s;&s;ible as for the &s;ame thing to be, and not to be at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>It follows from this that &s;inners mu&s;t be intere&s;ted in the promi&s;es, before it is po&s;&s;ible for them to believe, or do any thing in faith. For if there is no promi&s;e made to any thing lower than faith, and &s;hort of that, &s;o that the &s;inner may be intere&s;ted in the promi&s;e, before he believes, he never can believe, becau&s;e in order to his exerci&s;ing faith, he mu&s;t be intitled to the promi&s;e. But Mr. M. agrees, and has earne&s;tly contended that there is no &s;uch promi&s;e. Therefore, accord|ing to him it is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible, as impo&s;&s;ible, as that the &s;ame thing &s;hould be and not be at the &s;ame time, that there ever &s;hould be any &s;uch thing as faith exerci&s;ed by any in this world, whether re|generate or unregenerate: for none have a title to any promi&s;e before they believe.</P>
<P>It al&s;o hence follows that it is not the duty of the unregenerate to believe, and &s;o not their duty to exerci&s;e any true holine&s;s; nor are they in the lea&s;t to blame for the neglect of all this; it being ab&s;olute|ly impo&s;&s;ible to them. And if faith and repentance are not their du|ty, unbelief and impenitence are no &s;in. No wonder then Mr. M. has e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of the poor, innocent, unregenerate again&s;t me, who had charged them with great guilt and vilene&s;s in continuing im|penitent unbelievers, &amp; had repre&s;ented this as the greate&s;t &s;in of which they could be guilty. This is perfectly wrong and abu&s;ive, if his account of faith is right. And no wonder he is zealous to find a|bundance of unregenerate duties to be done; for according to him nothing el&s;e is their duty; and if they have no unregenerate duty to do, they have nothing to do, and nothing is required of them; it being mo&s;t unrea&s;onable and ab&s;urd to call upon them to repent and believe.</P>
<P>But if faith is a cordial belief of the truths of divine revelation; or &s;eeing them to be what they are <HI>with approbation of heart,</HI> &s;o that no|thing is wanting in order to this but a right ta&s;te and temper of mind, or a wi&s;e and under&s;tanding heart; then this is the duty of all, for the neglect of which, none have the lea&s;t excu&s;e; and all may be mo&s;t rea|&s;onably
<PB N="161" REF="011295_0084_0F869F2A818E73E8">
called upon to believe, and threatened with God's highe&s;t di&s;|plea&s;ure and eternal damnation, if they neglect it. But if Mr. M.'s account of faith is right, none of the&s;e things are true. Who can at|tend to this, and many other things which Mr. M. has &s;aid agreeable to it, and not think that at bottom, he believes the unregenerate are not at all to blame for unbelief, or any thing in which unregeneracy con&s;i&s;ts, even tho' he has never expre&s;sly a&s;&s;erted it, and has more than once granted the contrary?&mdash;But I pa&s;s to another thing which is worthy of particular notice.</P>
<P>MR. MILLS, after he has &s;aid much to prove that the unregenerate are commanded to do unregenerate duty; at length de&s;ires it may be noted to prevent mi&s;takes &amp; objections <Q>that in what has been, or may be &s;aid of the unregenerate's being required to pray, &amp;c. he would be under&s;tood to mean &s;uch of the unregenerate as are <HI>vi&s;ibly related to God in covenant;</HI> at lea&s;t, admitted by bapti&s;m, and thereby be|ing trained up under the advantages of the go&s;pel, laid under &s;olemn vows to deny ungodline&s;s, &amp;c. The&s;e, all the&s;e, whether regene|rate, or unregenerate are required to pray and attend on all other religious and <HI>chri&s;tian duties, as above.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 97.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>He keeps this in view, and reminds the reader near twenty times as a matter of great importance to be ob&s;erved, that he is &s;peaking of "God's covenant people." His "vi&s;ible covenant people, vi&s;ibly re|lated to God in covenant."</P>
<P>It is difficult, I think to know what he means by this. But let his meaning be what it will, it does not appear to what purpo&s;e he makes this ob&s;ervation, or what mi&s;takes and objections it tends to prevent. Does he mean to exclude all others from any obligations to do duty, and as not being required to do any duty at all? It &s;eems he does: But for what rea&s;on? If his arguments prove that there are unregenerate duties required of any, they equally prove they are required of <HI>all,</HI> whe|ther vi&s;ibly in covenant or not. Has Mr. M. nothing to &s;ay to others; mu&s;t not they be required to attend on means, pray and do other duties? mu&s;t they be left to abandon them&s;elves to all wickedne&s;s, and have nothing required of them? What does he mean by this di&s;tinction? Does he &s;uppo&s;e that none are under any obligation to any duty, until they of their own accord enter into covenant with God, and &s;olemn engagements and vows to do it? If there are any commands requiring &s;omething to be done by the unregenerate, while they continue &s;uch, being impenitent enemies to God, no rea&s;on can be given why all &s;uch, whether "vi&s;ibly related to God in covenant" or not, are not requir|ed to do the&s;e duties.</P>
<P>But why does he &s;ay, "The&s;e are required to pray, and attend <HI>other religious and chri&s;tian duties?</HI>" What he a&s;&s;erts, and attempts to prove is, that they are required to do <HI>unchri&s;tian</HI> duties: duties which per&s;ons are to do, not with a chri&s;tian, but with a perfectly unchri&s;ti|an &s;pirit; not as chri&s;tians, but as enemies to Chri&s;t. And how can the&s;e be called <HI>chri&s;tian</HI> duties?</P>
<P>By tho&s;e who are "vi&s;ibly related to God in covenant," he means,
<PB N="162" REF="011295_0085_0F869F2AF8F87CE8">
I conclude, if the words have any meaning, tho&s;e who have entered into covenant with God, by profe&s;&s;edly giving them&s;elves up to him, as his friends and &s;ervants, to be obedient to him in all things, as his people and &s;ervants, &amp; as the di&s;ciples of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. None but &s;uch are vi&s;ibly related to God in covenant. None but &s;uch put on the profe&s;&s;ion and appearance of God's people, nor are in <HI>appearance</HI> (which I &s;uppo&s;e is the &s;ame with being vi&s;ibly &s;o) in covenant with God. But &s;uch are in appearance and profe&s;&s;ion, or <HI>vi&s;ibly,</HI> not unre|generate, but true chri&s;tians. It is expe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed of the&s;e that they will do the duties which Chri&s;t requires of his people, and attend on all his in&s;titutions and ordinances, and walk agreeably to their profe&s;&s;ion and vows. So far as they vi&s;ibly fail of this, they come &s;hort of the cha|racter of tho&s;e who are "vi&s;ibly related to God in covenant." It is therefore impo&s;&s;ible that he who is vi&s;ibly unregenerate, can be of God's vi&s;ible covenant people, as impo&s;&s;ible as it is, that one &s;hould be a true chri&s;tian in appearance and profe&s;&s;ion, who at the &s;ame time <HI>appears</HI> to be an open enemy to Chri&s;t. There is therefore the great|e&s;t ab&s;urdity, in addre&s;&s;ing and teaching tho&s;e who are "vi&s;ibly related to God in covenant," as tho' they were unregenerate, and appeared to be &s;o, or directing and exhorting them to unregenerate duties. Therefore if &s;uch directions and requirements are made to any, they mu&s;t be made to the vi&s;ibly unregenerate, and not to tho&s;e who are God's vi&s;ible covenant people, or the vi&s;ible friends and &s;ervants of Chri&s;t. Mr. M. is therefore &s;o far from "preventing mi&s;takes and re|moving objections" in the&s;e words, that he has him&s;elf made as gro&s;s a mi&s;take as he well could, and opened a door to the greate&s;t objections, while he confines unregenerate duties to the vi&s;ibly regenerate, and at the &s;ame time calls them <HI>chri&s;tian</HI> duties; and excludes all the vi&s;ibly unregenerate, to whom alone exhortations and commands to unrege|nerate duties can be made, if to any, as not being the proper &s;ubjects of &s;uch exhortations and commands. The covenant of grace, the chri&s;tian covenant, by entering into which men become "vi&s;ibly related to God in covenant," propo&s;es and requires no duties to be done by them, as vi&s;ibly unregenerate and enemies to God, but <HI>chri&s;tian duties,</HI> which are incumbent on them as Chri&s;tians. Their entering into this cove|nant therefore lays them under no obligations to act as the unregene|rate, and do duties as &s;uch; but the contrary. If they might before this, while vi&s;ibly unregenerate, be exhorted and commanded to do unregenerate duties; they cannot now; upon their becoming vi&s;ible &s;aints, and vi&s;ibly related to God in covenant, they are to be treated as &s;aints, and not as unregenerate, and the duties of the chri&s;tian cove|nant, which they are to do in the character of Chri&s;tians, are to be in|dicated oh them, and no other.</P>
<P>Mr. M. however appears to be of a different opinion; he thinks the unregenerate may &s;incerely and heartily enter into covenant with God, and do chri&s;tian duty with no better a heart than they have, and not pretend, profe&s;s or engage any thing more than an unregenerate per&s;on may heartily do, con&s;i&s;tent with his being unregenerate and ap|pearing
<PB N="163" REF="011295_0085_0F869F2AF8F87CE8">
to be &s;o. However incon&s;i&s;tent this is in it&s;elf, it is in a mea&s;ure con|&s;i&s;tent with Mr. M.'s notion of the unregenerate, under awakenings and convictions of con&s;cience. He con&s;iders them to be &s;o humble, peni|tent and obedient; &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed towards their duty, and de&s;irous and inclined to obey and &s;erve God, and do all that they can; and as little or nothing to blame for not embracing the go&s;pel or doing any thing that implies regeneration and &s;aving conver&s;ion; that it is no wonder he thinks they may heartily give them&s;elves to God with a de&s;ire to &s;erve him, and do all their duty, waiting on God in this way, to do that for them, which they, (poor innocent creatures!) <HI>cannot,</HI> work in them|&s;elves, which they would be glad with all their hearts to do, if it was in their power. All who have &s;uch notions of the unregenerate, natural|ly talk of their covenanting with God and being his vi&s;ible covenant-people, while they are vi&s;ibly unregenerate; and think the unconverted may &s;incerely and properly do and be all this, and heartily perform ma|ny duties which are required of them; with much more &s;uch like jargon.</P>
<P>But they who con&s;ider the unregenerate as impenitent and ob&s;tinate enemies to God and Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who with all their hearts oppo&s;e and reject the go&s;pel, for which they have no excu&s;e, but are as voluntary and as wholly blameable in this, as in any external acts of &s;in; and that the&s;e external acts, &s;uch as lying and profane &s;wearing, derive all their odiou&s;ne&s;s and blame from this &s;infulne&s;s of heart, and (as being fruits of it: and that unregeneracy it&s;elf, or that in which it con&s;i&s;ts, is a mo&s;t odious, blamable, &s;candalous wickedne&s;s, and that no ex|ternal, overt act of &s;in is properly &s;candalous, in any other view than as an evidence and fruit of the former: I &s;ay, they who view things in this light, and have this notion of the unregenerate, which I have be|fore endeavoured to &s;hew is the true one, will never talk in the language of Mr. M. which I am con&s;idering. They have no notion that cove|nanting with God, and being God's vi&s;ible covenant people, is &s;o con&s;i&s;tent with the character of the unregenerate, that they have any right externally to enter into this covenant. They are &s;en&s;ible that &s;uch an appearance and profe&s;&s;ion, and vi&s;ible covenant relation to God becomes none but the true Chri&s;tian; and if the unregenerate take on them this appearance and profe&s;&s;ion, they lie to God and man, in a mo&s;t aggravated and &s;hocking manner; are guilty of mocking God, and of gro&s;s hypocri&s;y: and &s;o do that which is much more vile and provoking in God's &s;ight than no profe&s;&s;ion, or pretence to that which implies love to duty, and to God. And they know the unregenerate do not deny ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, and live &s;oberly and righteou&s;ly in this world unle&s;s it be in appearance and pretence, which is mo&s;t contrary to the truth, and the wor&s;t &s;ort of lying.</P>
<P>I SMALL conclude this &s;ection with ob&s;erving that Mr. M. has in the latter part of his book a great deal to &s;ay about "&s;ome that are, or have been public teachers." He charges tho&s;e with holding &s;everal things which I &s;hould think did not concern me, was it not that I am &s;ome how blended with them, as if we were one and the &s;ame. I know not what right Mr. M. had to do this. I have no connexions with them that
<PB N="164" REF="011295_0086_0F869F2BB66A57F8">
I know of, nor do I think I am obliged to an&s;wer for what they have &s;aid. It is enough if I can an&s;wer for my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I have heard there have been &s;ome religious jars and contentions of late years, in the county in which Mr. M. lives, and one or two mini|&s;ters have been depo&s;ed in the tumult. The&s;e things he attributes to the "new divinity" which he often mentions; and to "&s;ome who are or have been publick teachers." The&s;e, it &s;eems have rai&s;ed di&s;putes to the greate&s;t height, divided towns, broke &s;ocieties and churches, "ali|enated affection among dear brethren," &amp;c.<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">P. 121.</NOTE> Mr. M. has him&s;elf been very zealous and active in the&s;e affairs; and it has been though, by many, that he, with &s;ome of his brethren who joined with him, have overacted their parts, and have been them&s;elves very much the blam|able cau&s;e of the&s;e divi&s;ions and breaches, which might have been pre|vented or healed, in a great mea&s;ure at lea&s;t, had they conducted with that prudence and judgment, that brotherly tenderne&s;s and caution which became them.</P>
<P>But be this as it may, I &s;ee not what connexion the&s;e things have with any thing I have wrote. They took place chiefly before my &s;ec|tion on means was publi&s;hed, and "tho&s;e who are or have been public teachers," if I can gue&s;s who they are, have been as far from approving that &s;ection as Mr. M. him&s;elf. And I think his jumbling the&s;e things together as he has done, has no tendency to give light in the contro|ver&s;y between him and me; but is &s;uited to lead tho&s;e who have not been particularly acquainted with the&s;e matters, into a mi&s;take.</P>

He in&s;i&s;ts upon the nece&s;&s;ity of the influences of the &s;pirit of God, in order to bring men to an awakened, convinced &s;tate, or to what he calls legal repentance and humiliation. And yet he &s;uppo&s;es the Tyrians and Sydonians would have been actually brought to this, without any &s;uch influence, and by the bare u&s;e of the external means which the Jews enjoyed, and that Chri&s;t him&s;elf a&s;&s;erts this.<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">P. 12, 13.</NOTE></P>
<P N="5">V. He quotes the words of the We&s;tmin&s;ter and Savoy confe&s;&s;ions with approbation, in which it is &s;aid "the works done by the unrege|nerate <HI>cannot plea&s;e God.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P. 5, 6.</NOTE> And yet he &s;ays of Ahab, Jehu, and the I&s;|raelites at Mount Sinai, who were unregenerate, that God took <HI>a fa|vourable notice</HI> of their works, and gave <HI>his expre&s;s approbation</HI> of them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 31.</NOTE></P>
<P N="6">VI. In what he &s;ays concerning the &s;cribe,<NOTE N="[a]" PLACE="foot">P. 26&mdash;28.</NOTE> he &s;uppo&s;es that a per&s;on cannot be &s;aid to be near, or not far from the kingdom of God, on account of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ight &s;peculative knowledge.

<P N="9">IX. He in&s;i&s;ts upon it, that the doctrine that impenitent unbelievers grow more guilty and vile in the u&s;e of means, under awakenings and convictions, has a very bad tendency, and is matter of great di&s;courage|ment to a painful attendance on means, and encouragement to &s;inners to abandon them&s;elves to carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and vice. Yet he &s;ays that their appearing to them&s;elves to grow wor&s;e, which is commonly, if not al|ways the ca&s;e with tho&s;e under genuine convictions, is no matter of di&s;|couragement, but the contrary. The latter is in direct contradiction to the former; for if their looking on them&s;elves as growing wor&s;e, is no matter of di&s;couragement to them, then their really growing wor&s;e cannot be &s;o.</P>
<P N="10">X. Though he in&s;i&s;ts much upon it, that God requires duties of the unregenerate, which they are to do as &s;uch, and which are to be done without the exerci&s;e of any true holine&s;s or goodne&s;s; yet, in the mid&s;t

<P N="11">XI. Mr. M. is a zealous a&s;&s;erter that there is not one promi&s;e in the whole Bible, to the doings of the unregenerate; yet, in direct contra|diction to this, he repre&s;ents them as doing that to which expre&s;s pro|mi&s;es are made, and applies &s;uch promi&s;es to them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See P. 70, 72.</NOTE></P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>SHEWING the evil tendency of Mr. Mills's Inquiry.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT is hoped that what has been &s;aid, is &s;ufficient to &s;hew that what Mr. M. has de&s;igned chiefly to oppo&s;e in his <HI>Inquiry,</HI> are important truths, and therefore that what he advances and attempts to &s;upport, are real and hurtful errors: And the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> tendency of &s;ome things he has advanced has been mentioned and pointed out. But I &s;uppo&s;e it will be proper and u&s;eful more particularly to attend to this matter, and con&s;ider what is the natural tendency of this book, all taken together, &s;o far as it is received and has influence.</P>
<P N="1">I. I THINK it fully appears, from the view we have had of Mr. M.'s book, that it tends greatly to the di&s;honour of Chri&s;t and his go&s;|pel. It does &s;o in repre&s;enting &s;inners more to blame for other &s;ins, than for the &s;in of unbelief, and rejecting Chri&s;t and the go&s;pel; yea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> or if the &s;inner is little or nothing to blame for the latter, if he reforms all other known &s;ins. This view of the matter Mr. M.'s book gives; no one will ever learn from this, that the &s;in of rejecting Chri&s;t and the go&s;pel at heart, and that with direct acts of oppo&s;ition and enmity a|gain&s;t him, is a greater &s;in than injuries done to our neighbour: but he will find the contrary through the whole book implicitly or expre&s;sly a&s;&s;erted; and that he has often denied that there is any crime in the former. Thus he has ju&s;tified the wicked in the greate&s;t &s;in he is guilty of, and appear|ed on his &s;ide in the great and chief controver&s;y between Je&s;us Chri&s;t and &s;inners.</P>
<P>Now what could be more di&s;honourable to Chri&s;t and the go&s;pel than this, and what could &s;et his character and the great &s;alvation in a more unworthy, mean and contemptible light! It has been ob&s;erved in what a different light divine revelation &s;ets this matter; not only that men
<PB N="171" REF="011295_0089_0F869F31A3F96578">
are without excu&s;e and wholly to blame for not heartily embracing Chri&s;t and the go&s;pel; but that this is immen&s;ely the greate&s;t &s;in that men can be guilty of, in compari&s;on with which any other &s;in, is not to be mentioned: and it is ea&s;y to &s;ee in what a grand and honorable light this &s;ets Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And is it not as ea&s;y to &s;ee that the con|trary doctrine, which is Mr. M.'s, equally degrades and di&s;honors this glorious character?</P>
<P>In this Mr. M. has fallen in with the inclination and humour of a fallen world. Mankind are backward to be convinced of the &s;in of unbelief, and of not heartily receiving Chri&s;t, and embracing the go&s;|pel; they are inventing a thou&s;and pleas and excu&s;es in their favor, in oppo&s;ition to &s;uch convictions. They will be convinced of any thing almo&s;t, rather than this. And when any are convinced in their judg|ment and con&s;cience, that this is altogether their crime, and the great|e&s;t that they are guilty of, this truth is, beyond mo&s;t others, oppo&s;ite and galling to their hearts. All this is owing to their not having any love to Chri&s;t, nor a view and &s;en&s;e of his worthy and glorious cha|racter. Mr. M. has joined hands with them in this matter, and all he has &s;aid tends to prevent this conviction; to ju&s;tify and quiet the &s;in|ner in the pleas and excu&s;es he is making in his own favour. I there|fore think his book may be ju&s;tly looked upon as an attempt to exalt, flatter and ju&s;tify &s;inners, at the expence of the honor of the glorious Redeemer. I own I view the matter in this light; and this has been a &s;upporting and animating con&s;ideration to me in the mid&s;t of all the oppo&s;ition made to the doctrine I have advanced on this head, by means of Mr. M.'s book, or any other way; and in the pains I have taken to &s;upport this doctrine, in oppo&s;ition to Mr. M.'s objec|tions: for I con&s;ider my&s;elf as pleading the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t and attempting to exalt and honor his character, in oppo&s;ition to a &s;elf-ju&s;tifying world; and to condemn and aba&s;e the &s;inner, however im|perfect and deficient the attempt may be.</P>
<P N="2">II. MR. M.'s book tends to prevent &s;inners coming to any proper, true, and thorough conviction of their guilt and vilene&s;s, and the &s;tate they are in; and the whole drift and &s;pirit of it is in direct oppo&s;ition to this. This I have taken notice of in the foregoing &s;ections, and it appears from what has been ob&s;erved in the la&s;t particular. The &s;in|ners oppo&s;ition and enmity of heart again&s;t Chri&s;t and the go&s;pel is kept wholly out of &s;ight, through the whole of Mr. M.'s book, and the mo&s;t that he &s;ays, &s;uppo&s;es that there is no &s;uch thing in the heart of an awakened, convinced &s;inner; and is in direct oppo&s;ition to its being the greate&s;t of all &s;ins, if there is any &s;uch thing. Therefore wherever Mr. M.'s book is believed, and has influence, there will be no true genuine conviction of &s;in; and &s;o there can be no conver&s;ion to God. And he who is brought to genuine, thorough conviction of &s;in will renounce and di&s;card Mr. M.'s book, &s;o far as he un|der&s;tands it, as what is mo&s;t directly contrary to the truth. There is no medium between this and lo&s;ing his convictions. Mr. M.'s book is therefore ju&s;t as mi&s;chievous and hurtful in its tendency; as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> an
<PB N="172" REF="011295_0090_0F869F32D6B90058">
attempt to prevent &s;inners con&s;ciences being thoroughly awakened and convinced; or to remove &s;uch conviction wherever it takes place.</P>
<P N="3">III. MR. M.'s book exactly coincides with the inclination of the &s;inner's heart, who is in &s;ome degree awakened and thoughful about his eternal intere&s;t, and has reformed external &s;ins, and betook him|&s;elf to external duty; and tends to flatter &s;uch to their eternal de&s;truc|tion, and give them that ea&s;e and re&s;ting place, which mu&s;t be taken from them, or they will peri&s;h forever.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as a &s;inner's con&s;cience is awakened, he reforms his ex|ternal conduct, and betakes him&s;elf to external duty, with a view to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf from others, by his doings, to grow better, and do &s;omething to aba&s;e the divine anger and di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t him; and if he believes Mr. M.'s book, he will think he has obtained his end, and his con&s;cience will be quieted, and he will re&s;t in a great mea&s;ure ea&s;y and &s;ecure; for now he has for&s;aken <HI>all</HI> known &s;in, and does all known duty, and God is le&s;s angry with him; yea, takes a fa|vourable notice of him; and on this account he is in a likely way to be &s;aved. What can &s;uch an one have to di&s;quiet his con&s;cience? He has done his utmo&s;t, and waits at the foot of &s;overeign mercy for God to do the re&s;t, he not being at all to blame for not having a new heart and embracing the go&s;pel. In this re&s;ting place Mr. M.'s book fixes and &s;ecures him, where many thou&s;ands have peri&s;hed eternally!</P>
<P>Mr. M. has therefore, by his <HI>poor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">abor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> only provided a refuge of lies for the &s;inner to fly to and re&s;t in, which is perfectly agreeable to his heart, while an enemy to Chri&s;t, and the great &s;alvation. Nor can he po&s;&s;ibly be driven from this on his plan, and &s;o long as he be|lieves what he has written. There are multitudes of &s;ecure &s;inners now in New-England, and el&s;ewhere, who have had &s;ome awakenings of con&s;cience, and &s;erious thoughtfulne&s;s about their &s;ouls and eternal intere&s;t, and are in their view avoiding all known &s;in, by doing all duty; and are re&s;ting here, and in their own imagination waiting on God to do that for them which they cannot do of them&s;elves, and which they think they are not at all to blame for not doing. And here they will peri&s;h, unle&s;s driven from this refuge of lies, which they are as fond of as is the open profligate of his way of &s;inning. For men will love that which gives them ea&s;e and comfort. Such will therefore be plea&s;ed with Mr. M's book, and love it ju&s;t as much as they love their own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;e. And nothing will drive them from this fatal re&s;ting-place but a clear conviction of that which Mr. M. has kept wholly out of &s;ight through his book, and has at lea&s;t implicitly denied in all he has &s;aid in oppo&s;ition to me, viz. that the &s;inner is wholly to blame for not embracing the go&s;pel immediately; and that his want of a heart to do this, and the oppo&s;ition of his heart to it, is by far the greate&s;t crime he ever was guilty of, for which God is very angry with him, and his wrath abideth upon him, and he is every moment expo&s;ed to &s;ink in|to an aggravated de&s;truction. As &s;oon as they are convinced of this, they will &s;ee there has been no &s;incerity in all their reformations and doings; but all the exerci&s;es of their hearts have been a direct and
<PB N="173" REF="011295_0090_0F869F32D6B90058">
&s;trong oppo&s;ition to all that God requires of them; e&s;pecially to the important, merciful declaration, which implies the whole he has to &s;ay to &s;inners "This is my beloved &s;on, in whom I am well plea&s;ed: HEAR YE HIM" They will &s;ee that they have an amazingly hard and ob&s;tinate heart, for which they have no excu&s;e; that their neck is an iron &s;inew, and their brow bra&s;s; which appears in a more clear and &s;triking light now than ever, in that they per&s;i&s;t in oppo&s;ing and rejecting the mo&s;t kind invitations of the go&s;pel, under all the convic|tions of their con&s;ciences, and terrifying apprehen&s;ions of the wrath to come. It is needle&s;s to &s;ay that &s;uch a per&s;on will reject Mr. M.'s book, at the &s;ame in&s;tant that he is delivered from his former delu&s;ions, and is by the&s;e convictions driven from the fatal re&s;ting place ju&s;t mentioned.</P>
<P N="4">IV. MR. M.'s book tends to di&s;courage and drive to de&s;pair every &s;inner who has any good degree of true, genuine conviction, if it &s;hould be believed by &s;uch, unle&s;s it drives away his convictions, and he returns to a degree of &s;ecurity and ea&s;e.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved before, that this mu&s;t be the ca&s;e, according to Mr. M.'s own conce&s;&s;ion: for he allows that <Q>&s;inners, under deep and genuine convictions, have been ready to look upon them|&s;elves as greater &s;inners than heretofore; yea, perhaps, as growing daily wor&s;e and more hard-hearted.</Q> This being the ca&s;e, when &s;uch hear Mr. M.'s doctrine, that the de&s;ign of the u&s;e of means is to render them le&s;s guilty and vile, and that this is the great encourage|ment to u&s;e means, that hereby they may be in the way of duty and o|bedience, and become le&s;s &s;inful, &s;o as to obtain God's favourable notice and approbation, and on this account be more in the way of God's mercy, and, in the di&s;po&s;ition and exerci&s;es of their minds, get nearer to the &s;tate of a good man, and &s;o be more likely to be &s;aved: I &s;ay, when he hears this doctrine, and &s;till views him&s;elf in the light in which Mr. M. grants all &s;uch are ready to view them&s;elves (and I add in which &s;uch always view them&s;elves, as it is agreeable to the real truth, and not to &s;ee it, is to be greatly deluded; &s;o not to be un|der genuine convictions) &s;o far as he pays any regard to it, it will &s;trike di&s;couragement and de&s;pair through his heart. And the glori|ous go&s;pel which offers &s;alvation to the chief of &s;inners, as freely as to the lea&s;t &s;inner in the world, which can be the only relief and remedy to &s;uch an one, will be wholly hid from his eyes, until he renounces the chief and leading doctrines of Mr. M.'s book, as gro&s;s and fatal delu&s;ions.</P>
<P N="5">V. MR. M.'s book is &s;uited very much to plea&s;e Arminians and Semi-arminians, and to &s;upport and &s;trengthen them in their oppo&s;ition to the truths of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>It is certain that all the&s;e are, with no &s;mall degree of zeal on his &s;ide of the que&s;tion in this controver&s;y; and it is ea&s;y to &s;ee the rea|&s;on why they are &s;o. Mr M. has repre&s;ented his awakened, reform|ed &s;inner in a light very agreeable to their notion of &s;uch. He is a humble &s;inner, who, with tenderne&s;s of con&s;cience and trembling at
<PB N="174" REF="011295_0091_0F869F3422DFD370">
God's word, reforms all known &s;in, and complies with all known duty. He does his utmo&s;t, and &s;eeks the Lord with trembling, and tru&s;ts in his mercy, making this his only plea. All this the &s;inner comes to on principles of nature, and in this way obtains the divine approbation and favourable notice, and has nothing further to do, but thus to wait on God. And what rea&s;on has &s;uch a per&s;on for any di&s;tre&s;s and terror of con&s;cience? He is prepared to be comforted, and told that all things are well, and he has nothing to do but to hold on in this way of duty. This is exactly agreeable to their no|tion, and &s;ets human nature in its fallen &s;tate in the light in which they repre&s;ent it. They indeed may think that &s;uch are good Chri&s;|tians, and in the &s;ure way to heaven, and have nothing to &s;ay about regeneration, and a new heart by the immediate influences of the &s;pirit of God, in order to bring &s;uch per&s;ons to the exerci&s;e of what is called true grace after they have attained to all that has been mentioned. And tho' Mr. M. does not appear fully to agree with them in this, yet they have, many of them at lea&s;t, &s;en&s;e and di&s;cerning enough to &s;ee that herein he is quite incon&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf, and that if the things he chiefly in&s;i&s;ts upon, are allowed and e&s;tabli&s;hed, the fundamentals of their &s;cheme are e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the re&s;t will follow of cour&s;e. They can therefore patiently bear with a number of Mr. M.'s incon&s;i&s;tent whims (as they think them) about regeneration, &s;aving grace, &amp;c. while they are only mentioned incidentally, and not much in&s;i&s;ted up|on; and the&s;e things which are important articles in their &s;cheme are earne&s;tly contended for; &s;eeing if the latter are e&s;tabli&s;hed, the former cannot be maintained, but will of cour&s;e be neglected, if they do not fall into general contempt.</P>
<P>I would particularly ob&s;erve here, that the doctrine that they who are the lea&s;t &s;inners and have done mo&s;t duty, are on this account mo&s;t likely to be &s;aved, which runs thro' Mr. M.'s book, contains the &s;ub|&s;tance and &s;oul of the Arminian &s;cheme, and if followed in all its ju&s;t con&s;equences, will &s;ubvert every important doctrine of Calvini&s;m. For according to this, God in &s;hewing mercy to &s;inners has re&s;pect to their moral character, &amp; by di&s;tingui&s;hing them&s;elves from others, &amp; mending their moral character by becoming le&s;s &s;inful, and doing tho&s;e things by which they obtain God's approbation, they <HI>recommend</HI> them&s;elves to his mercy, as more fit and proper objects of it than others who&s;e moral character is wor&s;e, and who are greater &s;inners in God's &s;ight.&mdash;It is ea&s;y to &s;ee this turns every thing in this affair into the Arminian channel. It entirely &s;huts out the doctrine of God's &s;overeignty in the exerci&s;e of his &s;aving mercy towards &s;inners, having mercy on whom he will have mercy, without re&s;pect to any thing in their moral character, as being better or wor&s;e. And it founds the determinations of God with re&s;pect to the &s;alvation of one man rather than another, on &s;omething fore&s;een in his moral character, by which he has done &s;omething to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf from others. It introduces the Arminian notion of ju&s;tification by works; for according to this, their own moral character, and tho&s;e things by which they are lo&s;s &s;inful, do recommend them to God's &s;pecial favor, and are the rea&s;on and ground of their obtaining mercy rather than
<PB N="175" REF="011295_0091_0F869F3422DFD370">
others. But the &s;inner is certainly ju&s;tifiable by that which recommends him, and is the ground and rea&s;on of his finding mercy rather than a|nother, tho' it be but a negative righteou&s;ne&s;s, and le&s;s &s;infulne&s;s. And if this is of &s;uch avail with God, how much will po&s;itive virtue and goodne&s;s avail to recommend? And it follows from this that man is not in &s;uch a lo&s;t, helple&s;s, depraved &s;tate as Calvini&s;ts have generally repre|&s;ented him to be; but has tho&s;e good principles, in the exerci&s;e of which he may do his duty, and di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf, &s;o as to become one towards whom God's mercy more readily flows out, than towards another.</P>
<P>Mr. M. has appeared greatly alarmed at my e&s;pou&s;ing what he &s;ays is the Arminian &s;en&s;e of a &s;ingle text. He might rea&s;onably be much more alarmed, if he &s;hould &s;ee his own performance in a true light, and find that the mo&s;t that he had &s;aid, is in &s;upport of that cau&s;e. If he &s;hall not be made &s;en&s;ible of this, we may not expect to hear from him much more of the peculiar doctrines of Calvini&s;m.</P>
<P N="6">VI MR. M. has by this performance plea&s;ed and &s;trengthened all tho&s;e who are fixed upon a &s;elf-righteous bottom, who have never &s;een their own true guilt and vilene&s;s, and are thinking them&s;elves better than others, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who&s;e external moral conduct is not &s;o regu|lar and good as their own.</P>
<P>We have rea&s;on to think there are many &s;uch profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians. This may be the ca&s;e, whatever &s;ect or party they belong to; and let the principles they e&s;pou&s;e, or profe&s;&s;ion they make be what they will. They do at bottom think them&s;elves better than others, on &s;ome account or other, however in&s;en&s;ible they may be of it them&s;elves, and have ways to hide it from their own eyes, or from others. No wonder if &s;uch are well plea&s;ed with Mr M.'s book, and zealou&s;ly e&s;pou&s;e his cau&s;e; for what he has &s;aid is agreable to the di&s;po&s;ition and feelings of their hearts, and to their experiences. But it is difficult to conceive how the true Chri&s;tian, or the unregenerate under genuine convictions, can approve of the leading &s;entiments in this per|formance. Indeed Mr. M. has granted that the latter cannot, or is not like to do it; for he is ready to look on him&s;elf as a greater &s;inner than heretofore; and there is no other way for him to think him&s;elf to grow better, and le&s;s &s;inful, but to lo&s;e his convictions, and relap&s;e into his former delu&s;ions; &s;o no other way to reconcile him to Mr. M.'s book; unle&s;s it be by his becoming a true convert, and embracing the go&s;pel. But will this do it? He now has his eyes opened, in a &s;en&s;e and degree in which they were not before under the deepe&s;t and mo&s;t clear convicti|ons in an unregenerate &s;tate, to behold the a&s;toni&s;hing worthine&s;s and glory of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who has practi&s;ed the mo&s;t amazing conde&s;centi|on and goodne&s;s towards him, and always &s;tood at his door and knock|ed, and freely offered him&s;elf to him; and he beholds with wonder and a&s;toni&s;hment the wi&s;dom and glory of the go&s;pel, and the greatne&s;s and excellence of the &s;alvation which is by Chri&s;t; all which he has oppo|po&s;ed, rejected and de&s;pi&s;ed, under all the &s;cene of awakening, con|victions and di&s;tre&s;s which he has pa&s;&s;ed through. And in this view now abhors him&s;elf, and repents in du&s;t and a&s;hes at the feet of Chri&s;t.
<PB N="176" REF="011295_0092_0F869F34C29243A0">
And will he in the&s;e views look back on that horrid &s;cene of quarrelling with God, and re&s;olute, fixed oppo&s;ition of heart to the per&s;on who now appears &s;o glorious in his eyes, and a&s;toni&s;hingly good and kind, in which he re&s;i&s;ted and &s;trove with all his might again&s;t the inlighten|ing, awaking influences of the &s;pirit of God: I &s;ay, will he now think he was through all this growing le&s;s &s;inful, than he was in a &s;tate of &s;e|curity, and doing his duty, tho' not from the highe&s;t principles, yet on the good principles of nature; and that by thus growing better, he ob|tained God's favourable notice and approbation, and made approaches to the &s;tate and temper of a good man; and &s;o got more and more in to the way of mercy, until he arrived to thorough conver&s;ion! No &s;urely. He will view him&s;elf in a light directly contrary to this, to a degree not ea&s;ily expre&s;&s;ed. How then can he approve of Mr. M's book?</P>
<P>I can ea&s;ily &s;ee how &s;uch an one as our divine Teacher characteri&s;es in the Phari&s;ee &s;hould think the awakened, convinced &s;inner is become le&s;s &s;inful than he was before, and that God is more ready and inclined to &s;hew mercy to him on this account; and that he will look on him|&s;elf much better than any open profligate what&s;oever, and &s;well in his own thought of him&s;elf, and in his confidence of acceptance with God on this account. But I am quite mi&s;taken in my notion of a true Chri&s;tian, if he is ready to look on an impenitent rejecter of Chri&s;t, un|der genuine convictions as growing better, or on him&s;elf as on the whole a le&s;s &s;inner than the mo&s;t &s;ecure, deluded, and openly vicious &s;inner that he is acquainted with: Nor is it ea&s;y to prove that he is in fact &s;o: Con&s;idering his &s;uperior light and advantages, and the great and di&s;|tingui&s;hing obligations he is laid under by God's goodne&s;s to him; and con&s;idering the poor returns he makes, the weak and low degree of right exerci&s;es of heart; and the great and dreadful degree of oppo&s;ite ex|ertions and exerci&s;es; and the un&s;peakable degree of &s;inful deficiency in all his right and holy exerci&s;es, in which he falls &s;o va&s;tly &s;hort of the perfect rule of his duty: I &s;ay, if we take into view all this, perhaps it will be by no means clear that he is on the whole le&s;s guilty and vile, than he was in a &s;tate of unregeneracy; but be this as it will, it is hard to conceive how he, in the affecting view of the dreadful degree and a|mazing aggravations of his own &s;ins of omi&s;&s;ion and commi&s;&s;ion, &s;hould be <HI>ready to think</HI> him&s;elf a le&s;s &s;inner than others, or than he once was. Therefore he is in no danger of u&s;ing the language which the Phari&s;ee did before God. "God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are,&mdash;or even as this publican." At the &s;ame time I &s;ee not why all who under&s;tandingly approve of Mr. M.'s book &s;hould not u&s;e this very lan|guage; and why this mu&s;t not be the language of their hearts, what|&s;oever words they u&s;e.</P>
<P>If any profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tian is di&s;po&s;ed to look on him&s;elf a le&s;s &s;inner, le&s;s guilty and vile in God's &s;ight, than he was in a &s;tate of &s;ecurity in his youth; and that he has been growing a le&s;s &s;inner ever &s;ince he was fir&s;t awakened, and looks round on profligate &s;inners, as on the whole much more vile than him&s;elf; and approaches to God with this view of him&s;elf, as being on this account more in the way of God's mercy,
<PB N="177" REF="011295_0092_0F869F34C29243A0">
and a more fit and proper object of it: I &s;ay, if he views him&s;elf in this light, and has an&s;werable exerci&s;es of heart, (which is indeed agreeable to the &s;pirit of Mr. M.'s whole book) he is, I think, a &s;trange &s;ort of Chri&s;tian, even as &s;trange a one as was the phari&s;ee when he went up to the temple to pray.</P>
<P N="7">VII. M. M.'s book is &s;uited to plea&s;e all tho&s;e who think them&s;elves good Chri&s;tians, and are excu&s;ing them&s;elves in their deficiencies, and want of the exerci&s;es of love to God, and every chri&s;tian grace, from their utter inability, and want of power to exerci&s;e and perform the&s;e things: and tends greatly to &s;upport and &s;trengthen them in this dan|gerous wicked way.</P>
<P>There are many, we have rea&s;on to think, of this &s;ort. The doctrine of man's inability to do any thing &s;piritually good and holy of him|&s;elf they imbibe as a certain and important truth: And as they hold it, is very agreeable to their corrupt hearts; for they at bottom think they are under an inability, or want of power to be holy, which does really excu&s;e them for not living in the con&s;tant exerci&s;e of faith, and love to God. So that the doctrine, as they hold it, is not true, and is as a|greeable to the corrupt heart of man, as any that was ever invented. Hence it undoubtedly is that many are &s;uch zealous defenders of it, and have it &s;o much in their mouths, that man can do nothing of him&s;elf, &amp;c. And when this doctrine is &s;et in a true, &s;criptural light, and it is in&s;i&s;ted upon that man is under no inability to any good exerci&s;e, but what con&s;i&s;ts in the perver&s;ene&s;s and wickedne&s;s of his heart, for which he has no manner, no degree of excu&s;e; that he has full power and a|bility to do every thing that God commands; to embrace the go&s;pel, and be perfectly holy, were it not for his indi&s;po&s;ition of heart and un|willingne&s;s to do it; and that the whole difficulty lies here, and is ju&s;t the &s;ame as in any other ca&s;e, where a per&s;on is backward and unwilling to do what is propo&s;ed to him; only as it may be greater in degree, more perfect and fixed; and therefore that this inability, and inexcu&s;a|ble, voluntary, aggravated wickedne&s;s, are one and the &s;ame thing; and the more of this &s;ort of inability there is, the more vile is the per|&s;on; and &s;o much more guilty and inexcu&s;able: I &s;ay, when they hear this, they are greatly di&s;plea&s;ed and alarmed, and cry out of it as Ar|miniani&s;m, or a very bad and dangerous doctrine; becau&s;e it deprives them of their &s;weet re&s;ting place and refuge to which they have been u&s;ed to flee, and get ea&s;e to their con&s;ciences, and avail them&s;elves of an excu&s;e, &s;o as not to feel them&s;elves guilty for that which is indeed their greate&s;t &s;in, and the chief of all their wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>Such per&s;ons as the&s;e, in&s;tead of confe&s;&s;ing their &s;ins, are hiding them from their own eyes, and excu&s;ing them&s;elves in that for which they ought to be greatly a&s;hamed and blu&s;h before God; &s;o have ne|ver been in any good mea&s;ure convinced of &s;in, but are really ju&s;tifying them&s;elves before God in their greate&s;t wickedne&s;s: And they are of a &s;pirit and temper as contrary to true Chri&s;tianity, as can well be ima|gined.
<PB N="178" REF="011295_0093_0F869F3577D434B0">
And the doctrine of man's impotency, as they hold it, is really as contrary to the truth, and as agreeable and plea&s;ing to corrupt na|ture, as are any of the Arminian doctrines which a&s;&s;ert man's &s;elf-&s;uffici|ency to all that is required of him; and more &s;o in &s;ome re&s;pects.</P>
<P>All &s;uch will no doubt, like Mr. M's book, and be agreeably &s;up|ported and &s;trengthened by it. But this is only to confirm them in a wicked cour&s;e, highly di&s;honorable to Chri&s;t and the go&s;pel; in a delu|&s;ion which, if per&s;i&s;ted in, will prove ruinous to them, whatever great experiences, and remarkable di&s;coveries and comforts they may boa&s;t of.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>IN which Mr. Mills's &s;peaking again&s;t METAPHY|SICAL REASONING AND ARGUMENTS, is brief|ly con&s;idered.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. M. has not expre&s;sly a&s;&s;erted that any of my rea&s;oning in &s;upport of what he oppo&s;es is <HI>metaphy&s;ical;</HI> much le&s;s has he at|tempted to point out any particular in&s;tances of <HI>metaphy&s;ical rea&s;oning</HI> in any pa&s;&s;age of mine, upon which he remarks. However, he often &s;peaks of <HI>metaphy&s;ics, metaphy&s;ical &s;ubtelties, ab&s;tru&s;e metaphy&s;ical rea&s;oning,</HI> &amp;c. with di&s;approbation, and in &s;uch a manner as will lead the reader to think he has to deal with an antagoni&s;t, who is very metaphy&s;ical. Now metaphy&s;ical rea&s;oning is the &s;ame in his account, with ab&s;tru&s;e, unintelligible, fallacious and deceitful rea&s;oning, on which there is no dependance, and ought to be wholly di&s;regarded and avoided. The mo&s;t remarkable pa&s;&s;ages of his on this head are the following.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P. 30, 31.</NOTE> <Q>Here removing <HI>as far as po&s;&s;ible from</HI> all <HI>ab&s;tru&s;e metaphy&s;ical rea&s;oning,</HI> and far fetched con&s;equences, at lea&s;t doubtful and uncertain; of which kind experience teacheth that what is called demon&s;tration in one age, is rejected in another; and what is called &s;o by one man is of no validity with another; and oft times with the &s;ame man at diffe|rent dates of his life: let us, I &s;ay, removing as far as po&s;&s;ible from the&s;e things, &amp;c.</Q> Again,<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">P. 103.</NOTE> <Q>Another ground of this mi&s;take, as it ap|pears to me, is too great a fondne&s;s for, and dependence upon conclu&s;ions come into, as the re&s;ult of &s;ubtile metaphy&s;ical rea&s;oning, as tho' they were certain, and might be depended on; while nothing is more common than mi&s;takes in the&s;e ca&s;es, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved here, that what he condemns, and profe&s;&s;es to keep at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from, under the name of <HI>metaphy&s;ical rea&s;on|ing,</HI> includes all rea&s;oning that can be u&s;ed by men; for it is common for men to make mi&s;takes in rea&s;oning, in whatever way they rea&s;on:
<PB N="179" REF="011295_0093_0F869F3577D434B0">
And the be&s;t and cleare&s;t rea&s;oning, which is real demon&s;tration, is cal|led &s;o in one age, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">cted in another: and the mo&s;t &s;trong and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> rea&s;oning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> allowed to be &s;o with one man, and yet be of no avail with another; and this may be the ca&s;e with the &s;ome man at dif|ferent periods of his life. Therefore to keep at the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible di&s;|tance from all rea&s;oning of which the&s;e things may be predicated, is the &s;ame as to keep at the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible di&s;tance from all rea&s;oning whatever.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, it is worthy to be con&s;idered perhaps, whether Mr. M. has helped him&s;elf, or his reader by all this caution; and whether he has not, after all, fallen into &s;uch a way of rea&s;oning, whether <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> be called metaphy&s;ical or not, as is of no validity with him&s;elf in different dates of his life, and by which he has repeatedly rea&s;oned him&s;elf into con|tradictions at the &s;ame time of life. Of this the reader who has at|tended to the foregoing &s;ections will judge. If by <HI>ab&s;tru&s;e metaphy&s;ical rea&s;oning</HI> be meant nice di&s;tinctions where there is no difference, or u&s;ing words without any di&s;tinct and clear ideas; affirming and denying the &s;ame thing at different times, and drawing oppo&s;ite con&s;equences from &s;ame premi&s;es; mi&s;taking and mi&s;repre&s;enting the thing about which the que&s;tion is perhaps Mr. M.'s <HI>Inquiry</HI> is as remarkable an in|&s;tance of &s;uch <HI>metaphy&s;ics</HI> as any this age has produced.</P>
<P>But if by <HI>metaphy&s;ical rea&s;oning</HI> and arguments, is meant making cri|tical and clear di&s;tinctions between tho&s;e things which really differ, and carefully examining tho&s;e &s;ubjects to the bottom which have been treated in a confu&s;ed, intricate manner, or have been thought by many quite ab&s;tru&s;e and unintelligible, there is no rea&s;on why any one &s;hould try to keep at a di&s;tance from this, or avoid it in any in&s;tance; for to do &s;o, is only to confu&s;e and bewilder him&s;elf, and to take a method to keep him&s;elf in ignorance with re&s;pect to the mo&s;t important and in|tere&s;ting &s;ubjects. And it will be evident to any one who will allow him&s;elf to think, that the holy &s;criptures cannot be in any good mea&s;ure under&s;tood, and the con&s;i&s;tence of one pa&s;&s;age with another di&s;covered, if &s;uch rea&s;oning as this is neglected. And this is, in effect, laying a&s;ide all clear rea&s;oning on any &s;ubject, and to make rea&s;on it&s;elf a very u&s;ele&s;s thing, and to &s;ub&s;titute &s;omething el&s;e in the &s;tead of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Many have conceived &s;uch an aver&s;ion to what they call metaphy&s;ics, and carefully keep at &s;uch a di&s;tance from every thing which to them is ab&s;tru&s;e, uncertain and difficult to be under&s;tood, that they are never like to know any thing that requires clo&s;e attention of thought, and any degree of accurate rea&s;oning; or make any progre&s;s in the mo&s;t u&s;eful knowledge. And, what is wor&s;e, they do what they can to prevent o|thers from entering into a free, critical and painful inquiry after truth, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who are in their youth, and are coming upon the &s;tage, by gravely cautioning them again&s;t meddling with metaphy&s;ical &s;ubjects, and dark, ab&s;tru&s;e matters; and directing them to attend only to the things that are plain and ea&s;y, and require no metaphy&s;ical arguments to inve&s;tigate or &s;upport them. Unhappy is the young &s;tudent in
<PB N="180" REF="011295_0094_0F869F364CFCB8E8">
divinity who has this advice, and is influenced by it: For by acting up|on this maxim, and endeavouring to keep at the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible di&s;|tance from metaphy&s;ics in this &s;en&s;e, he will have but little more know|ledge than what he has by tradition; and this too will chiefly con&s;i&s;t in a &s;et of orthodox words, without having any intelligible meaning to them. If clo&s;e and accurate rea&s;oning falls into di&s;credit, and a care to make clear and nice di&s;tinctions, and the utmo&s;t pains to enter deep into important &s;ubjects, and &s;earch them to the bottom, are neglected; the mind mu&s;t have very little true knowledge, and can come to no proper &s;atisfaction and certainty about any thing, that re|quires rea&s;oning; and is under a nece&s;&s;ity of r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g in indolence and ig|norance.</P>
<P>IT has been the way of almo&s;t all &s;ects and parties when they have found them&s;elves unable to &s;upport their cau&s;e by rea&s;on, and have been oppo&s;ed and pre&s;&s;ed with rea&s;ons and arguments, which they have not been able fairly to an&s;wer, to cry out again&s;t &s;uch rea&s;oning, and to endeavour to bring it into di&s;grace, by calling it by &s;ome ill name. Thus the Quakers, and almo&s;t all enthu&s;ia&s;ts when urged with mo&s;t clear &amp; demon&s;trative rea&s;ons again&s;t many of their ab&s;urd notions, which they have not been able to an&s;wer, have endeavoured to &s;upport them&s;elves, by calling <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> rea&s;on,</HI> and repre&s;enting it as &s;omething directly contrary to the bible, and all true religion.</P>
<P>And Pelagians and Arminians have been in too many in&s;tances treat|ed &s;o by their opponents, the profe&s;&s;ed Calvini&s;ts. The former have gloried in their rea&s;oning again&s;t the latter, as unan&s;werable demon&s;tra|tion. The latter in&s;tead of detecting the weakne&s;s, fallacy and ab&s;urdi|ty of the rea&s;oning of the former, and maintaining their cau&s;e on this ground, as well they might; have endeavoured to defend them&s;elves from this weapon by bringing it into di&s;grace, and rejecting it under the name of <HI>carnal, un&s;anctified rea&s;on,</HI> &amp;c. This has been &s;o far from humbling or giving them the lea&s;t conviction of their errors, that it has had a contrary effect to a very great and, &s;en&s;ible degree. And no wonder; for this was the direct tendency of it, as it is an implicit con|fe&s;&s;ion that they felt them&s;elves wor&s;ted at rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>Some of the latter, however, e&s;pecially of late, have undertaken to <HI>rea&s;on</HI> with the former; and have defended the principal doctrines of Calvini&s;m, and have been able to &s;hew that they can be &s;upported by the &s;tricte&s;t rea&s;on and argument, and are agreeable to the rea&s;on and com|mon &s;en&s;e of mankind, as well as to the holy &s;criptures: and have detected the weakne&s;s and fallacy of much of the rea&s;oning of the for|mer; and have made it appear that many of their principal tenets are contrary to all rea&s;on, and imply the greate&s;t and mo&s;t palpable ab&s;urdi|ties. Upon this the former unable to defend them&s;elves any longer with their boa&s;ted rea&s;on, have affected to run down all rea&s;on and ar|guments u&s;ed again&s;t them, only by calling them <HI>ab&s;tru&s;e, metaphy&s;ical</HI> rea&s;oning and notions.</P>
<P>And in this &s;ome profe&s;&s;ed Calvini&s;ts are joining with them to keep
<PB N="181" REF="011295_0094_0F869F364CFCB8E8">
up the cry of <HI>metaphy&s;ics,</HI> either becau&s;e they are too indolent and in|atentive to attend to clo&s;e and accurate rea&s;oning; or find &s;ome of their own tenets in which they are incon&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves, con|futed by arguments which they are by no means able to an&s;wer. And thus Sandeman and his followers, &s;en&s;ible that they cannot &s;o well de|fend their &s;cheme of religion by rea&s;on, and confute what is urged again&s;t them from this quarter, are well on their guard again&s;t any rea&s;oning, e&s;pecially that which they cannot an&s;wer, and endeavour to keep them&s;elves in countenance by exploding it under the name of <HI>vain philo&s;ophy,</HI> and <HI>carnal rea&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>It is allowed that rea&s;on maybe abu&s;ed and perverted to bad pur|po&s;es, as well as any thing el&s;e; and men may rea&s;on very plau&s;ibly, and with the pretence and appearance of great exactne&s;s and accu|racy, and clear demon&s;tration, and yet their arguments be at bottom very weak, &s;ophi&s;tical and ab&s;urd. In this ca&s;e, it becomes the friends of truth to detect and &s;hew the weakne&s;s, fallacy and ab&s;urdity of the rea&s;oning, in&s;tead of rejecting it all only by calling it <HI>ab&s;tru&s;e meta|phy&s;ical rea&s;oning,</HI> &amp;c. For the be&s;t and cleare&s;t rea&s;oning may be called by &s;uch names, as well as any thing el&s;e, and often has been. And when any one takes the latter method, he will not be wronged, I conclude, if we determine that he does it purely becau&s;e he is not able to an&s;wer the argument, and finds him&s;elf wor&s;ted at rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>The cry again&s;t <HI>metaphy&s;ics</HI> has of late been increa&s;ing; by which tho&s;e who make it would condemn, and prejudice people again&s;t e|very thing in divinity which they either do not under&s;tand, or di&s;like, and yet are unable to &s;hew it to be contrary to &s;cripture or rea&s;on. Yea, &s;ome &s;peak again&s;t teaching and vindicating tho&s;e truths and doctrines, which they acknowledge to be agreeable to &s;cripture, and contained in it, merely becau&s;e they are, they &s;ay, metaphy&s;ical niceties, and &s;o ab&s;tru&s;e and difficult to be under&s;tood, that it is much be&s;t to &s;ay nothing about them; and not trouble people with things, which they never can under&s;tand.</P>
<P>It may be ea&s;ily accounted for, if this out-cry is made by tho&s;e who would prevent attention to doctrines which they di&s;like, but cannot con|fute; or by lazy, &s;uperficial thinkers, who are not willing to be at the pains to think clo&s;ely upon any &s;ubject: and at the &s;ame time have &s;uch an opinion of their own knowledge &amp; penetration, as to conclude that what <HI>they</HI> do not under&s;tand, no one el&s;e does, or ever can. But it is difficult to &s;ay why any others &s;hould join with them, and it is a pity that they &s;hould be influenced by them.</P>
<P>Every truth in the bible is dark and ab&s;tru&s;e to all tho&s;e who do not under&s;tand it. And tho' &s;ome doctrines are more ea&s;ily under&s;tood than others; yet none can be well and clearly under&s;tood without thought and attention of mind: And &s;ome of the mo&s;t important doctrines never will be under&s;tood by lazy, &s;uperficial, inaccurate thinkers. The bible was never de&s;igned to be under&s;tood by tho&s;e who will not be all attention to it, and &s;tudy it with that exact and
<PB N="182" REF="011295_0095_0F869F36F7EDA468">
accurate tho't and rea&s;oning, by which they may di&s;tingui&s;h the things that differ. He only who will thus "cry alter knowledge &amp; lift up his voice for under&s;tanding; &s;eek for her as for &s;ilver, &amp; &s;earch for her as for hid trea&s;ures," &s;hall under&s;tand what are the doctrines of Chri&s;tianity, &amp; find the knowledge of God. So far therefore as the cry of <HI>metaphy&s;ics</HI> prevails, &amp; people are hereby held back from thinking for them&s;elves, and are prejudiced again&s;t every thing which they now do not under|&s;tand, and again&s;t all attempts to explain and vindicate any truth contained in the bible, becau&s;e at fir&s;t thought it is dark and ab&s;tru&s;e to them, and they do not under&s;tand it; ju&s;t &s;o far the bible is locked up from them, as really as it is from the common people in the church of Rome. And it is perhaps worthy of particular notice, that the objections made by Papi&s;ts again&s;t the bible's being read by common people, are nearly the &s;ame with tho&s;e, which are urged by tho&s;e who are for excluding all metaphy&s;ical rea&s;oning from matters of religion, viz. That they will not under&s;tand it; being very incompetent judg|es of the&s;e things, they will only puzzle and confute their own minds; or they will rea&s;on them&s;elves into error; think differently from one another, and &s;o get into hurtful and endle&s;s di&s;putes.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>THE reader who has been at the pains carefully to peru&s;e the whole of the foregoing treati&s;e, will find the unregenerate &s;in|ner &s;et in a dreadful and very &s;hocking light. He is dead in tre&s;|pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eph. II. 1.</NOTE> An entire enemy to God in his mind by wicked affections and works, and all he does is &s;in, even of the nature of oppo&s;ition and enmity again&s;t God:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. VIII. 7. Col. I. 21.</NOTE> And he is wholly inexcu&s;able and perfectly to blame for every minute's continuance in this &s;tate for every wrong exerci&s;e of heart, and for not repenting and believ|ing the go&s;pel. And all means u&s;ed with him: all the light and ad|vantages he has, &amp; all his awakenings, and convictions of con&s;cience, &s;erve to aggravate and increa&s;e his guilt and vilene&s;s; and all his &s;trivings and prayers, are very &s;inful and vile, provoking and a|bominable in God's &s;ight. He is every hour &s;inking deeper into guilt, and after his hard and impenitent heart-trea&s;uring up wrath again&s;t the day of wrath, and the revelation of the righteous judgment of God.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Rom. II. 5.</NOTE> And this is the &s;cripture account of the matter.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="011295_0095_0F869F36F7EDA468">
Upon this view of the matter, the que&s;tion will naturally ari&s;e. What &s;hall he do? If one &s;hould be told that he may find this que&s;ti|on a&s;ked more than once in the bible, and immediately an&s;wered by in&s;pired men, &s;hould we not expect he would eagerly &s;earch to find what the an&s;wer is, and re&s;t &s;atisfied in it? The an&s;wer is, "Repent and be baptized.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Acts II. 38.</NOTE> Believe on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts XVI. 31.</NOTE> This divinely in&s;pired an&s;wer to this important que&s;tion is plain and ea&s;y to be un|der&s;tood. This is the awakened, convinced &s;inner's next and imme|diate duty: and not to do this immediately; but to do &s;omething el&s;e in&s;tead of it, is to rebel again&s;t Chri&s;t, which rebellion is aggravated and criminal in proportion to his degree of light and conviction.</P>
<P>It is his indi&s;pen&s;able duty immediately to take all that blame to him&s;elf which belongs to him, and to ju&s;tify God, and his law which condemns him, and heartily approve of it; entirely to give up all his old objections which his heart has made again&s;t God, and his ways, as wholly groundle&s;s and infinitely criminal; and heartily to renounce all his pleas in his own favor, whereby he has ju&s;tified him&s;elf, and by which he has been oppo&s;ing God and quarrelling with him; and on which he has really been placing his whole dependance; which, had they been right, would have wholly excu&s;ed him, and ca&s;t all the blame on God, and his law. I &s;ay it is his immediate duty to give up all the&s;e objections and pleas, which his whole heart, as be|ing infinitely criminal, and to feel and acknowledge that he has done nothing but trea&s;ure up wrath, and that he is mo&s;t ju&s;tly condemned to eternal de&s;truction.</P>
<P>And as there is no hope in the ca&s;e of &s;uch a &s;inner, but what ari&s;es from the truth of the go&s;pel, even the free and &s;overeign grace of God in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, therein revealed; and as the greate&s;t &s;inner is as free|ly invited as the lea&s;t to come to Chri&s;t, and receive pardon and &s;alvation without money and without price; it is the &s;inner's duty without delay, to drop all his prejudices, and di&s;affection to Chri&s;t and the go&s;pel, which have heretofore blinded his eyes, and hid the all-convincing evidence of it's truth and glory from his heart; and to admit the evidence of the truth and divinity of the go&s;pel, and be|lieve with all his heart that Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t, the Son of God, and that God has rai&s;ed him from the dead, with a hearty approbation of his character, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to him, and tru&s;t in him as his Lord and Saviour, his prophet, prie&s;t and king, being heartily devoted to his &s;ervice, his intere&s;t and glory.</P>
<P>All this, I &s;ay is the &s;inner's immediate, indi&s;pen&s;able duty, which is to "repent and believe the go&s;pel." To this he is therefore to be exhorted and urged by all proper motives; and all the in&s;truction given him ought to be with a view to this. And unle&s;s he complies with this, and repents and turns to God, all means and advantages, all light and conviction; all his exerci&s;es, &s;trivings and exertions, will &s;erve to &s;ink him deeper into de&s;erved perdition. So long as the &s;inner believes this, and has his attention kept up to it, in a view and &s;en&s;e of the dreadfulne&s;s of damnation, he will be pained at heart,
<PB N="184" REF="011295_0096_0F869F3C67B14528">
in a view of his dreadful ca&s;e, and will find no ea&s;e till his heart gives up every point of controver&s;y between him and his Maker, and he heartily embraces the go&s;pel. And to exhort him, and &s;et him to do any thing &s;hort of this as his duty, in doing which he will become le&s;s &s;inful and abate the divine di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t him, and be waiting on God, &amp;c. is to divert him from that truth which is of the highe&s;t importance to him to be attended to; and to give him that ea&s;e and re&s;t, which mu&s;t be taken from him, or he will peri&s;h forever.</P>
<P>If we will look into the bible and carefully examine that, we &s;hall find that &s;inners are no where exhorted to any thing &s;hort of re|pentance and turning from &s;in to God, or to any thing which does not imply this. This is what Mo&s;es and the prophets exhort to; And Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles inculcate this on &s;inners as their next and immediate duty, and exhort to nothing &s;hort of this. How then can any who have the bible in their hands, be at a lo&s;s how to addre&s;s &s;inners, and not know what exhortations are to be given to them?</P>
<P>SOME perhaps may think that by dropping all exhortations to &s;in|ners to &s;ome doings and duty &s;hort of repentance and embracing the go&s;pel, we condemn all the revivals of religion and &s;uppo&s;ed conver|&s;ions that have taken place in former times in New-England, or el&s;e|where; as they &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e have taken place under the preaching which has inculcated unregenerate duties, and this is the only preach|ing which has been &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>

If the matter is well examined into, it will doubtle&s;s be found that whenever there has been any remarkable revival of religion, which has been attended with &s;uch appearances and vi&s;ible effects, as to give rea&s;on to believe it was in any mea&s;ure genuine, it has been under the in&s;truction and preaching which has principally in&s;i&s;ted upon the guilty lo&s;t &s;tate of the &s;inner, his utter inexcu&s;ablene&s;s in rejecting Chri&s;t and the go&s;pel; the great and aggravated wickedne&s;s of all his exerci&s;es and doings while he continues in impenitence and unbelief: the &s;ufficiency and willingne&s;s of Chri&s;t to &s;ave all that come to him; and the exhortations which have been principally in|&s;i&s;ted upon have been to come to Chri&s;t, and embrace the go&s;pel. And under &s;uch preaching, and in the view of the&s;e truths &s;inners have been awakened, and hopefully converted. Therefore at &s;uch times e&s;pecially the complaint has been wont to be made, which is made by many now, viz. That &s;inners were called upon and mo&s;t ear|ne&s;tly exhorted to repent and believe, but were not told <HI>how</HI> they &s;hould do this, by being directed to a &s;et of duties &s;hort of faith, by which they &s;hould obtain it.</P>
<P>And if at &s;uch times there has been a mixture of preaching diffe|rent from this, and contrary to it, and there have been exhortations to unregenerate duties; there is not the lea&s;t evidence that this has had a good tendency; but we have rea&s;on to conclude that it has done hurt rather than good, &s;o far as it had any influence.</P>
