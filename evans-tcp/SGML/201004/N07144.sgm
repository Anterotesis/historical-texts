<Q><BIBL><HI>ACTS XIII. 36&mdash;</HI></BIBL>
<P><HI>&mdash;DAVID,</HI> after he had &s;erved his Generation, by the Will of <HI>GOD</HI> [<HI>or,</HI> having in his own Age &s;erved the Will of <HI>GOD,</HI>] fell on Sleep, and was laid to his Fathers, and &s;aw Corruption.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_GREAT and good Characters are often formed by <HI>Imitation:</HI> And if we would &s;hine in any Sphere, we mu&s;t propo&s;e to our&s;elves &s;ome illu&s;trious Examples. Great Generals have acquited their martial Skill, by peru&s;ing the Memoirs of the ALEX|ANDERS and CAESARS of former Ages. And LONGINUS advi&s;es us, if we would ri&s;e to the Sublime in Writing, al|ways to keep in View, a Homer, a Plato, a Demo&s;thenes or a Cicero. And how &s;hall the more amiable, tho' le&s;s glaring and renowned Character of the <HI>good,</HI> the <HI>u&s;eful,</HI> and <HI>publick-&s;pirited</HI> Man, be formed? Nothing &s;urely can contri|bute more towards it, than the imitation of &s;ome bright <HI>Ex|ample.</HI> And among all the Kings, Patriots and Prophets, who&s;e Names are immortalized in &s;acred Hi&s;tory, no <HI>Exam|ple</HI> &s;hines with a brighter Lu&s;tre, than that of DAVID, who <HI>&s;erved his own Generation according to the Will of God,</HI> and then, as a weary Labourer, gently <HI>fell on Sleep,</HI> and &s;weetly re&s;ted from his generous and pious Toils.</P>
<P>As this is my la&s;t Addre&s;s to you, my dear and worthy young Friends, who have now happily fini&s;hed the Cour&s;e of your Education, and are about to take Leave of this So|ciety, in which you have been in&s;tituted for public Life, I have been very &s;olicitous to &s;elect &s;ome Subject of Impor|tance, to employ your Thoughts in this precious Hour, that
<PB N="4" REF="009101_0005_1031030ADBEFEAA0">is peculiarly adapted to you pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances and future Pro&s;pects. And after anxious Inquiry, I can fix upon none, that appears to me more perti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ent or u&s;eful, than the Example of DAVID; a Man characterized from the highe&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Excellency to which human Nature can arrive, <HI>Conformity to God</HI> the Standard of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Perfection; <HI>A Man after God's own Heart:</HI> A Man, that without the Advan|tages of Birth or Education, and without the di&s;hone&s;t Arts of a Courtier, ro&s;e to the Height of human Grandeur, and became an ext<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> Ble&s;&s;ing to the Church and his Coun|try: A Man, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">om an A&s;&s;emblage of exalted Characters were united, beyond all Precedent; and who &s;hines con&s;pi|cuous, thro' all Ages, in the <HI>&s;eparate</HI> Splendors of <HI>each,</HI> and the <HI>collected</HI> Splendors of <HI>all;</HI> an invincible Hero in the Field; a magnificent and good King on the Throne; a great Example of pa&s;&s;ive Loyalty under Per&s;ecution, of Fortitude and Patience under Affliction, on a Mountain, in a Cave, or a Wilderne&s;s; an evangelical Prophet, a devout and &s;ublime Poet, e'er <HI>Home<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>'s Mu&s;e was known, and, to fini&s;h all, <HI>the Servant of God and his Generation.</HI> 'Tis <HI>this</HI> la&s;t Part of his Character, my Text delineates. 'Tis <HI>this</HI> I would propo&s;e to your Imitation, as not beyond your Reach. And indeed, in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">is</HI> are &s;ummed up all the com|plicated Excellencies of his other Characters. He <HI>&s;uffered,</HI> he <HI>f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ught,</HI> he <HI>reigned,</HI> he <HI>prophecied,</HI> he <HI>&s;ung,</HI> he perform|ed <HI>every</HI> Thing, to <HI>&s;erve his Generation, according to the Will of God.</HI></P>
<P>The Excellency of the Example now before you, con&s;i&s;ts in two Things, PUBLICK SPIRIT and RELIGION.&mdash;Public Spirit, <HI>in &s;erving his Generation,&mdash;and Religion, in doing</HI> this <HI>according to the Will of God,</HI> or, (as it might be tran&s;|lated,) &s;erving <HI>the Will of God,</HI> in his own Generation. The Union of the&s;e two Qualities ever compo&s;es the truly good and u&s;eful Man; a proper Member of human Society; and even of the grand Community of Angels and Saints. The one includes a Temper and Conduct agreeable to our <HI>&s;ocial</HI> Connections; and the other a Temper and Conduct agreeable to our Obligation to the Author of our Nature. And &s;o in&s;eparable are the&s;e united, that the one cannot exi&s;t, in the entire Ab&s;ence of the other. Public Spirit and Benevolence without Religion, is but a warm Affection for the Subjects, to the Neglect of their Sovereign; or a Par|tiality
<PB N="5" REF="009101_0006_1031030E13B10018">for the Children, in Contempt of their Father, who is infinitely more worthy of Love. And Religion without Publick Spirit and Benevolence, is but a &s;ullen, &s;elfi&s;h, &s;our and malignant Humour for Devotion, unworthy that &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cred Name. <Q>For if a Man love not his Broth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r, whom he hath &s;een, how can he love God whom he hath not &s;een?</Q> But when the&s;e are united, they form a beautiful Symme|try; they adorn, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ri&s;h and perfect each other; they con|tain the Sub&s;tance of all Obedience to the divine Law, which is &s;ummed up in <HI>the Love of God,</HI> and <HI>the Love of Man.</HI> And if you, my dear Youth, enter into the World with this Foundation of future Utility and Importance laid in your He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, my highe&s;t Wi&s;hes will be accompli&s;hed in you; and all the little Pains we have taken in your Educa|tion, will be more than repaid. It will be a Ble&s;&s;ing to the World, that ever you pa&s;&s;ed thro' it; an Honour to this Dome, that ever you re&s;ided in it; and an everla&s;ting joy to your&s;elves, that ever you were born.&mdash;To excite and cheri&s;h &s;uch a Spirit, I can at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> comprehen&s;ive Epitome of the Hi&s;tory of DAVID.</P>
<P>&mdash;"HE <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> his Generation."&mdash;To be the <HI>Servant</HI> of the Public, was his Ambition; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>Love</HI> to Church and State, was the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of his Life. His public Spirit pu&s;hed him on to engage in the mo&s;t fatiguing, &s;elf-denying &amp; d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">s Services; he thought nothing too hard, nothing bene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> his Dignity, that was conducive to the publick Good. Was he <HI>King</HI> of the Thou&s;ands of <HI>I&s;rael?</HI> This only made him the <HI>Servant</HI> of Thou&s;ands; at once increa&s;ing his Labour, and enlarging the Sphere of his Beneficence. His Royal Prerogative was but an Obligation to <HI>&s;erve;</HI> and his Authority but a Power of doing more exten&s;ive Good. Was he an able <HI>General,</HI> and a mighty <HI>Conqueror?</HI> He fought, he conqured, not to gratify the &s;ordid Pa&s;&s;ions of Avarice, Ambition, or private Revenge; but to deliver his Country, to guard his Subjects, to cha&s;ti&s;e and re&s;train the Di&s;turbers of Mankind, and to execute publick Vengeance upon public Malefactors. Had he a fine, a &s;ublime Imagination? And did <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>In&s;piration</HI> animate him with poetical Fire? His im|mortal Writings be&s;peak a Brea&s;t glowing with the united Fervors of both. This Accompli&s;hment he did not pro&s;ti|tute to mean &s;elfi&s;h or impious Porpo&s;es; but con&s;ecrated it
<PB N="6" REF="009101_0007_1031030F9EDF7528">to the Church. His Mu&s;e was a heavenly Seraph, teaching Mortals to celebrate the Prai&s;es of JEHOVAH in a Language above Humanity; and furni&s;hing a divine Sy&s;tem of P&s;al|mody, mo&s;t perfectly adapted to that Religious Di&s;pen&s;ation under which he lived; and capable of being accommodated, by a natural and ea&s;y Variation, to the more improved State of the Go&s;pel-Church. Could his <HI>Prophetic</HI> Eyes penetrate into Futurity, beyond the Ken of human Knowledge, and pry into "the deep Things of God?" This al&s;o was con&s;e|crated to the Service of his Generation, and not converted into O&s;tentation, Amu&s;ement or idle Curio&s;ity. In &s;hort, all his Talents, natural ond &s;upernatural, were &s;acred to the Church, to his Country and Mankind; thus becoming univer&s;al and di&s;tingui&s;hed Ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P>THIS, my dear Pupils, this is the Spirit, with which I would in&s;pire you. A public Spirit always appeared to me of the utmo&s;t Importance, this you are &s;en&s;ible is not the fir&s;t Occa&s;ion on which I have endeavoured to fire your Brea&s;ts with the generous Flame. Devoid of this, though &s;tationed in the mo&s;t publick Offices, your Lives will be of little U&s;e to Community; and all the valuable Ends of a liberal Edu|cation, will be lo&s;t upon you. But if you feel the generous Impul&s;es of a publick Spirit, you can never be altogether in&s;ignificant, you will never be mere Cyphers in the World, even in the ob&s;cure&s;t and mo&s;t &s;eque&s;tered Vale of Life. Even in the lowe&s;t Station, you will be of &s;ome U&s;e to Mankind, a &s;ufficient Recompence this for the &s;evere Conflict of &s;ixty or &s;eventy Years. It is unknown to me, and per|haps to your&s;elves, in what Employment you will &s;pend your future Lives. But whatever it be, whether you appear in the &s;acred De&s;k, as the <HI>Mini&s;ters of God,</HI> and devote your|&s;elves to that Office, in which you can have no bright Pro&s;pects of &s;ecular Advantages, but only the benevolent and God-like Plea&s;ure of endeavouring to make Men wi&s;e, good and happy; or whether you appear at the Bar, as Advocates for Ju&s;tice, and the Patrons of the Oppre&s;t; or whether you practi&s;e the <HI>healing Art</HI> in the Chambers of Affliction, to alleviate the Pains and Sickne&s;&s;es of your Fellow-Creatures, to re&s;tore the Sweets of Health, and pro|long the dubious Duration of Life; or whether you choo&s;e the &s;erene and quiet Plea&s;ures of Retirement, and glide through the World in a private Station; whatever, I &s;ay,

For other Generations, God rai&s;ed up other Servants, accompli&s;hed according to the Work he had to do in them: And thus, the great Scheme of his Providence is carried on, thro' the fleeting Succe&s;&s;ion of human Nature, and never &s;ails of Execution, for want of In&s;truments.

The eternal World indeed is all Life and Action; and that State of Re&s;t, which remains for the People of God, is not a State of more idle Fruition, or quiet Inaction. It is indeed a Re&s;t from the painful La|bours of this State of Di&s;cipline and Trial; tho' it not only admits, but nece&s;&s;arily includes, Action of a more exalted and plea&s;ing Nature; a vigorous and indefatigable Di&s;|charge of high Offices in the grand Community of the Univer&s;e; Offices of more Importance, and more exten&s;ive Utility, than the feeble Sons of Mortality can &s;u&s;tain. No|thing but &s;uch a State of benevolent Activity, can be a proper Heaven for vigorous Immortals, who&s;e Powers de|mand perpetual Exertion; and without it, they would be painful and cumber&s;ome, or lie dormant and in&s;en&s;ible; both which would be incon&s;i&s;tent with their perfect Felicity. Yet this is no Rea&s;on why we &s;hould re&s;erve our U&s;efulne&s;s to another State; for Time and Eternity have each its proper Work; and the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the one, can be no more done in the other, than if it were a State of entire
<PB N="10" REF="009101_0011_103103200EFAE278">Inaction; &s;eize therefore the pre&s;ent flying Moments. Do the Work of Time in Time. Eternity has its Work too; but it is Work of a more exalted Kind, not adapted to the pre&s;ent infant State of our Exi&s;tence. If you remain in|active and u&s;ele&s;s in this Life, the Bu&s;ine&s;s of it can never be done. If you &s;erve the World at all, it mu&s;t be in <HI>your own</HI> Age. You will never be able to make up the Neglect, in another Age of Time, or in the endle&s;s Ages, of Eter|nity. Nay, if you continue u&s;ele&s;s in your own Age, you will continue &s;o through all the Periods of your immortal Exi&s;tence, For you &s;hould never forget, that Advance|ment to a State of more exten&s;ive U&s;efulne&s;s in the eternal World, is the Reward only of faithful Labourers in this. Oh! remember the Doom of the <HI>&s;lothful Servant,</HI> whom his Ma&s;ter di&s;charged for ever from his Service, and delivered up to the Tormentors.</P>
<P>THE other Part of <HI>David</HI>'s Character, which I would propo&s;e to your Imitation, is his RELIGION. He &s;erved his Generation <HI>by,</HI> or <HI>according to</HI> THE WILL OF GOD. <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">The original Word here, &s;ignifies rather the <HI>Coun&s;el,</HI> than the <HI>Will of God.</HI> And if we thus tran&s;late it, the Meaning is, Either that David &s;erved his Generation, according to the Pur|po&s;e of God in rai&s;ing him up: Or, that he accompli&s;hed the Pur|po&s;e of God concerning him, and performed his de&s;tined Work.</NOTE><HI>The Will of God,</HI> was the Rule of his Beneficence to Men; and he &s;erved his Generation, becau&s;e in &s;o doing he &s;erved his God. Whatever he did, he did heartily, as unto the <HI>Lord,</HI> and not unto <HI>Men.</HI> 'Tis this Regard to the Will of God, in Acts of Humanity and Public-Spirit, that &s;ancti|fies them, and renders them true Virtue and Religion. Without &s;uch a Regard to the divine Will, they form but a mon&s;trous, athe&s;tical Patrioti&s;m, and an un-creature-like irreligious Benevolence. Without this, all our good Offi|ces to Men, as they are not intended, &s;o neither will they be accepted, as Acts of Obedience to God. Certainly, it mu&s;t be the Height of Impiety, to be capable of doing even what God commands, not <HI>becau&s;e</HI> he commands it, but for &s;ome other &s;ordid, &s;elfi&s;h Rea&s;on. The greate&s;t Stre&s;s is laid upon this, in the refined Morality of the Go&s;pel. To receive a righteous Man, as a righteous Man; to receive a Prophet <HI>in the Name</HI> of a Prophet; to give fo much as a
<PB N="11" REF="009101_0012_10310323597F5BE8">Cup of cold Water, to the lea&s;t of Chri&s;t's Di&s;ciples <HI>becau&s;e he belongs to Chri&s;t;..</HI>.this is at once an Act of Charity and Piety. But without &s;uch a Regard to God, it is but a poor, grovelling, &s;elfi&s;h Humanity; and has no more real Good|ne&s;s in it, than the In&s;tinctive Fondne&s;s of a Brute for its Young.</P>
<P>THEREFORE, my young Friends, let Religion be the Source of your Benevolence and Publick-Spirit; and have a Regard to the Will of God, in all your good Offices to Men. Let it not be your principal End, to gratify a na|tural Benevolence of Temper; to procure Honour to your|&s;elves, or to accompli&s;h &s;ome intere&s;ted De&s;ign; but to PLEASE GOD. Let this be the Center, in which all the Actions of your Life &s;hall terminate, and the Scope to which they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">end. Then you may claim a Character more noble than even that of a Patriot, I mean a CHRISTIAN.</P>
<P>THIS Thought will appear in a &s;till &s;tronger Light, if we follow the other Ver&s;ion of the Text.... <Q>David, in his own Generation, having &s;erved <HI>the Will of God</HI></Q>....not his <HI>own</HI> Will; not the Will of <HI>Man;</HI> but the Will of <HI>God.</HI> All his Services were done in Obedience to the Will of his heavenly Ma&s;ter. He did not a&s;&s;ume the Direction of his Conduct, nor the Management of him&s;elf; but he was Servant to the Will of God; that was his ab&s;olute Rule in all Things; to which he yielded an unre&s;erved univer&s;al Obedience.</P>
<P>THIS al&s;o I propo&s;e for your Imitation in future Life, Be not ambitious of Self-Government, but re&s;ign your&s;elves to the Will of God. Serve his Will, and be the Mini&s;ters of his Plea&s;ure. Whatever is agreeable to it, pur&s;ue with all your Might; and let even its gentle&s;t Prohibitions, give you an effectual Check, in your mo&s;t eager Career. In &s;hort, do the Will of God, and then you will do all that is noble, all that is good, all that is benevolent and u&s;eful. To be dependent upon the capricious Will of a Mortal, is a wretched State of Indigence, Servility and Anxiety But the Divine Will is the &s;upreme unerring Rule of Right; and in ob&s;erving it, you will certainly promote your own Happine&s;s, and the Good of the Sy&s;tem to which you belong, in the mo&s;t effectual Manner.</P>
<P>To fini&s;h what I have to &s;ay to you at pre&s;ent on the Head of <HI>Religion,</HI> I mu&s;t add, That tho' I addre&s;s you in
<PB N="12" REF="009101_0013_10310325306509C0">the <HI>exhortatory</HI> Form, and would <HI>per&s;uade</HI> you to exert your|&s;elves, yet I would by no Means intimate, that the Forces of mere Nature, in their utmo&s;t Exertion, can produce in you that public Spirit and Piety I am recommending, with|out the Agency of the <HI>Holy Spirit.</HI> 'Tis He that is the &s;ole Author of all that little Religion and true Virtue, that is to be found here and there in our World. And there|fore to Him you mu&s;t look; on Him you mu&s;t depend; yet &s;till in the Exertion of all your natural Powers, and in the earne&s;t U&s;e of all in&s;tituted Means; for the Idle have no Rea&s;on to expect his A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>I MUST add farther, that great Change of Temper, that Extirpation of the corrupt Principles of Nature, and that Implantation of holy and &s;upernatural Principles of Action, which the Scriptures expre&s;s by &s;uch &s;trong and &s;ignificant Metaphors as <HI>Regeneration,</HI> a <HI>Re&s;urrection,</HI> a <HI>new Creation,</HI> and the like; I &s;ay, that divine Change of the Principles of Action, is the great Foundation of true Religion and &s;ocial Virtue; without which, you can never arrive at the fini&s;hed Character of good and great Men.
