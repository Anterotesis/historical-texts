<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is of great importance to every citizen of the United States, in whatever &s;tation of life, to be acquainted with the hi&s;tory of his own country, and, in a &s;econdary degree, with that of America in general.</P>
<P>The requi&s;ite expen&s;e and time, however, for acquiring this information, are neither within the reach of every pur&s;e, nor the lei&s;ure of every reader. And there are many whom neither of the&s;e ob&s;tacles need deter, who, neverthele&s;s, look upon a large book, as a feeble traveller <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oes upon a long journey, to be a ta&s;k beyond their patience and per&s;everance to get through.</P>
<P>To obviate the&s;e difficulties, the compiler of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he following work has been at great pains to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ompri&s;e in &s;mall bulk and at a low price, from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he be&s;t authorities, a general hi&s;tory of Amer|ica, and an account of the United States from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he di&s;covery of North America, till the e&s;tab|li&s;hment of the federal government.</P>
<P>In that part of the work which regards the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ate and character of the colonies before the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">e war, the authorities are quoted.

But in the remain|der
<PB REF="028963_0004_0FDDBD2B198AF890">of the work, it was thought unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;well it with quotations.</P>
<P>The Compiler has endeavoured to unite brev|ity with per&s;picuity; and has accordingly abridg|ed the matter from his authorities, as he judged nece&s;&s;ary. He has likewi&s;e frequently u&s;ed the words as well as the ideas of the writers, without particularly apprizing the reader of it.</P>
<P>The Annual Regi&s;ter, Dr. Gold&s;mith's Hi&s;to|ry of England, and the Continuation of Hume's Hi&s;tory, have been u&s;ed in de&s;cribing foreign occurrences, connected with the Revolution. The writings of Dr. Belknap, Dr. Ram&s;ay, Dr. Gordon, and Dr. Mor&s;e, have been freely made u&s;e of in what regarded American affairs.

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Extent and Boundaries of America&mdash;Grand Objects which it pre&s;ents t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> View&mdash;its Mountains&mdash;Rivers&mdash;Lakes&mdash; its exce&s;&s;ive Luxuriance of Vegetation.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>BEFORE we proceed to de&s;cribe the gradual &s;tep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by which America finally obtained her independ|ence, we &s;hall lay before the reader a general hi&s;tory of America; and an account of the &s;ettlement and politi|cal &s;tate of the colonies.</P>
<P>America is one of the four quarters of the world, probably, the large&s;t of the whole, and is, from its late di&s;covery, frequently denominated the <HI>New World,</HI> or <HI>New Hemi&s;phere.</HI></P>
<P>This va&s;t country extends from the 80th degree of north, to the 56th degree of &s;outh, latitude; and, where its breadth is known, from the 35th to the 136th degree we&s;t longitude from London; &s;tretching between 8000 and 9000 miles in length, and in its greate&s;t breadth 3690. It &s;ees both hemi&s;pheres, has
<PB N="14" REF="028963_0007_0FDDBD329AEB8A60">two &s;ummers and a double winter, and enjoys almo&s;t all the variety of climates which the earth affords. It is wa&s;hed by the two great oceans. To the ea&s;tward, it has the Atlantic, which divides it from Europe and Africa; to the we&s;t, it has the Pacific or Great South Sea, by which it is &s;eparated from A&s;ia. By the&s;e &s;eas it may, and does, carry on a direct commerce with the other three parts of the world.</P>
<P>America is not of equal breadth throughout its whole extent; but is divided into two great continents, called <HI>North,</HI> and <HI>South, America,</HI> by an i&s;thmus 1500 miles long, and which, at Darien, about Lat. 9&deg; N. is only 60 miles over. This i&s;thmus forms, with the northern and &s;outhern continents, a va&s;t gulph, in which lie a great number of i&s;lands, called the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> in contradi&s;tinction to the ea&s;tern parts of A&s;ia, which are called the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI></P>
<P>Next to the extent of the New World, the gran|deur of the objects which it pre&s;ents to view, is mo&s;t apt to &s;trike the eye of an ob&s;erver. Nature &s;eems here to have carried on her operations upon a larger &s;cale and with a bolder hand, and to have di&s;tingui&s;hed the features of this country by a peculiar magnificence. The mountains of America are much &s;uperior in height to tho&s;e in the other divi&s;ions of the globe. Even the plain of Quito, which may be con&s;idered as the ba&s;e of the Andes, is elevated farther above the &s;ea than the top of the Pyrenees. The mo&s;t elevated point of the Andes, according to Don Ulloa, is twenty thou&s;and, two hundred, and eighty feet, which is, at lea&s;t, &s;even thou&s;and, one hundred, and two feet above the Peak of Teneriffe, which is the highe&s;t known mountain in the ancient continent.</P>
<P>From the lofty and exten&s;ive mountains of America, de&s;cend rivers with which the &s;treams of Europe, of A&s;ia, or of Africa, are not to be compared, either for length of cour&s;e, or for the va&s;t volumes of water which they pour into the oceans. The Danube, the Indus
<PB N="15" REF="028963_0007_0FDDBD329AEB8A60">the Ganges, or the Nile, in the Ancient Hemi&s;phere, are not of equal magnitude with the St. Lawrence, the Mi&s;&s;ouri, or the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, in North America; or the Maragnon, the Oroonoko, or the Plata, in South Ameri|ca. The rivers in the latter of the&s;e American conti|nents are like va&s;t arms of the &s;ea.</P>
<P>The lakes of the New World are no le&s;s con&s;picu|ous for grandeur than its mountains and rivers. There is nothing in other parts of the globe which re&s;embles the prodigious chain of lakes in North America. They may be properly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ermed inland &s;eas of fre&s;h water; and even tho&s;e of the &s;econd or third cla&s;s of magnitude, are of larger circuit (the Ca&s;pian &s;ea excepted) than the greate&s;t lake of the ancient continent.</P>
<P>The luxuriance of the vegetable creation in the New World is extremely great. In the &s;outhern provinces, where the moi&s;ture of the climate is aided by the warmth of the &s;un, the woods are almo&s;t impervious, and the &s;urface of the ground is hid from the eye, un|der a thick covering of &s;hrubs, of herbs, and weeds. In the northern provinces, although the fore&s;ts are not encumbered with the &s;ame wild luxuriance of vegeta|tion, the trees of various &s;pecies are generally more lofty, and often much larger, than are to be &s;een in any other parts of the world.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>General De&s;cription of the Natives&mdash;their Peculiarities of Ornament and Dre&s;s&mdash;remarkable In&s;en&s;ibility to Pain, and to the Inclemencies of the Weather&mdash;terrible Trials undergone by their Chiefs.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE will now turn our attention to the <HI>Aborigines,</HI> or natives of the New World. At the time when his great continent was made more generally known
<PB N="16" REF="028963_0008_0FDDBD35AA3C58F0">to the Europeans by the di&s;coveries of Chri&s;topher Co|lumbus, and of the illu&s;trious navigators who imbibed the &s;pirit and enthu&s;ia&s;m of that great man, it was found inhabited by various tribes and nations of men, who differed, in many re&s;pects, from mo&s;t of the people in the three other quarters of the world. In their phy&s;ical hi&s;tory, however, the greate&s;t peculiarity in the Ameri|cans is their complexion, and the little difference which is ob&s;erved, in this re&s;pect, throughout the whole ex|tent of the American continent.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the inland parts of South Ameri|ca, where that continent is wide&s;t, and con&s;equently, the influence of the &s;un mo&s;t powerful, have never been accurately compared with tho&s;e of Canada, or more northerly parts, at lea&s;t as far as we know. Yet this ought to have been done, and that in many in&s;tances too, before it could be a&s;&s;erted &s;o po&s;itively, as mo&s;t au|thors do, that <HI>there is not the lea&s;t difference of complexion among the natives of America.</HI> Indeed, &s;o many &s;y&s;tems have been formed concerning the&s;e &s;ingular people, that it is very difficult to obtain a true knowledge of the mo&s;t &s;imple facts, even from the be&s;t and mo&s;t unpreju|diced writers.&mdash;If we may believe the Abb&eacute; Raynal, the Californians are &s;warthier than the Mexicans; and &s;o po&s;itive is he in this opinion, that he gives a rea&s;on for it. "This difference of colour," &s;ays he, "proves, that the civilized life of &s;ociety &s;ubverts, or totally changes, the order and laws of nature, &s;ince we find, under the temperate zone, a &s;avage people that are blacker than the civilized nations of the torrid zone."&mdash;On the other hand, Dr. Robert&s;on cla&s;&s;es all the inhabitants of Span|i&s;h America together with regard to colour, whether they are civilized or uncivilized; and when he &s;peaks of Californa, takes no notice of any peculiarity in their colour more than others.&mdash;The general appearance of the indigenous Americans in various di&s;tricts, is thu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> de&s;cribed by the chevalier P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">to: "They are all of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> copper colour, with &s;ome diver&s;ity of &s;hade, not in pro|portion
<PB N="17" REF="028963_0008_0FDDBD35AA3C58F0">to their di&s;tance from the equator, but accord|ing to the degree of elevation of the territory in which they re&s;ide. Tho&s;e who live in a high country are fair|er than tho&s;e in the mar&s;hy low lands on the coa&s;t. Their face is round; farther removed, perhaps, than that of any people from an oval &s;hape. Their forehead is &s;mall; the extremity of their ears far from the face; their lips thick; their no&s;e flat; their eyes black, or of a che&s;nut colour, &s;mall, but capable of di&s;cerning ob|jects at a great di&s;tance. Their hair is always thick and &s;leek, and without any tendency to curl. At the fir&s;t a&s;pect, a South American appears to be mild and inno|cent; but, on a more attentive view, one di&s;covers in his countenance &s;omething wild, di&s;tru&s;tful and ful|len."</P>
<P>The following account of the native Americans is given by Don Antonio Ulloa, in his late work, entitled <HI>Memoires philo&s;ophiques, hi&s;toriques, et phi&s;iques, concernant la decouverte de l'Amerique.</HI></P>
<P>The American Indians are naturally of a colour bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|dering upon red. Their frequent expo&s;ure to the &s;un and wind changes it to their ordinary du&s;ky hue. The temperature of the air appears to have little or no in|fluence in this re&s;pect. There is no perceptible dif|ference in complexion between the inhabitants of the high and tho&s;e of the low parts of Peru; yet the cli|mates are of an extreme difference. Nay, the Indians who live as far as 40 degrees and upwards &s;outh or north of the equator, are not to be di&s;tingui&s;hed, in point of colour, from tho&s;e immediately under it.</P>
<P>There is, al&s;o, a general conformation of features and per&s;on, which, more or le&s;s characterizeth them all. Their chief di&s;tinctions, in the&s;e re&s;pects, are a &s;mall forehead, partly covered with hair almo&s;t to the eye|brows, little eyes, the no&s;e thin, pointed, and bent to|wards the upper lip; a broad face, large ears, black, thick, and lank hair; the legs well formed, the feet &s;mall, the body thick and mu&s;cular; little or no beard
<PB N="18" REF="028963_0009_0FDDBD3A39B4A8C8">on the face, and that little never extended beyond a &s;mall part of the chin and upper lip. It may ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed that this general de&s;cription cannot apply, in all its parts, to every individual; but all of them par|take &s;o much of it, that they may be ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed even from the mulattoes, who come neare&s;t to them in point of colour.</P>
<P>The re&s;emblance among all the American tribes is not le&s;s remarkable in re&s;pect to their genius, character, manners, and particular cu&s;toms. The mo&s;t di&s;tant tribes are, in the&s;e re&s;pects, as &s;imilar as though they formed but one nation.</P>
<P>All the Indian nations have a peculiar plea&s;ure in painting their bodies of a red colour, with a certain&s;pe|cies of earth. The mine of Guancavelica was former|ly of no other u&s;e than to &s;upply them with this mate|rial for dyeing their bodies; and the cinnabar extracted from it was applied entirely to this purpo&s;e. The tribes in Loui&s;iana and in Canada have the &s;ame pa&s;|&s;ion; hence minium is the commodity mo&s;t in demand there.</P>
<P>It may, perhaps, &s;eem &s;ingular, that the&s;e nations, who&s;e natural colour is red, &s;hould affect the &s;ame col|our as an artificial ornament. But, it may be ob&s;erved they do nothing in this re&s;pect but what corre&s;ponds to the practice of Europeans, who al&s;o &s;tudy to heighten and di&s;play to advantage the natural red and white of their complexions. The Indians of Peru have now, in|deed, abandoned the cu&s;tom of painting their bodies: but it was common among them before they were con|quered by the Spaniards; and it &s;till remains the cu&s;|tom of all tho&s;e tribes who have pre&s;erved their liberty. The northern nations of America, be&s;ides the red colour which is predominant, employ al&s;o black, white, blue, and green, in painting their bodies.</P>
<P>The adju&s;tment of the&s;e colours is a matter of as great con&s;ideration with the Indians of Loui&s;iana and the va&s;t regions extending to the north, as the ornaments
<PB N="19" REF="028963_0009_0FDDBD3A39B4A8C8">of dre&s;s among the mo&s;t poli&s;hed nations. The bu&s;i|ne&s;s it&s;elf they call <HI>Mactaher,</HI> and they do not fail to ap|ply all their talents and a&s;&s;iduity to accompli&s;h it in the mo&s;t fini&s;hed manner. No lady of the greate&s;t fa&s;hion ever con&s;ulted her mirror with more anxiety, than the Indians do while painting their bodies. The colours are applied with the utmo&s;t accuracy and addre&s;s. Upon the eye lids, preci&s;ely at the root of the eye la&s;hes, they draw two lines, as fine as the &s;malle&s;t thread; the &s;ame upon the lips, the openings of the no&s;trils, the eye-brows, and the ears; of which la&s;t they even follow all the inflexions and &s;inuo&s;ities. As to the re&s;t of the face, they di&s;tribute various figures, in all which the red predominates, and the other colours are a&s;&s;orted &s;o as to throw it out to the be&s;t advantage. The neck al&s;o receives its proper ornaments; a thick coat of ver|million commonly di&s;tingui&s;hes the cheeks. Five or &s;ix hours are requi&s;ite for accompli&s;hing all this with the nicety which they affect. As their fir&s;t attempts do not always &s;ucceed to their wi&s;h, they efface them, and begin a-new upon a better plan. No coquette is more fa&s;tidious in her choice of ornament, none more vain when the important adju&s;tment is fini&s;hed. Their de|light and &s;elf-&s;atisfaction are then &s;o great, that the mirror is hardly ever laid down. An Indian <HI>mactached</HI> to his mind, is the vaine&s;t of all the human &s;pecies. The other parts of the body are left in their natural &s;tate, and, excepting what is called a <HI>cachecul,</HI> they go entirely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aked.</P>
<P>Such of them as have made them&s;elves eminent for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ravery, or other qualifications, are di&s;tingui&s;hed by fi|gures painted on their bodies. They introduce the co|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ours by making punctures on their &s;kin, and the extent of &s;urface which this ornament covers is proportioned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o the exploits they have performed. Some paint only their arms, others both their arms and legs; others a|gain, their thighs, while tho&s;e who have attained the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ummit of warlike renown have their bodies painted
<PB N="20" REF="028963_0010_0FDDBD3BADC529C0">from the wai&s;t upwards. This is the heraldry of the Indians; the devices of which are, probably, more exactly adju&s;ted to the merits of the per&s;ons who bear them, than tho&s;e of more civilized countries.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e ornaments, the warriors al&s;o carry plumes of feathers on their heads, their arms, and an|cles. The&s;e, likewi&s;e, are tokens of valo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, and none but &s;uch as have been thus di&s;tingui&s;hed may wear them.</P>
<P>The propen&s;ity to indolence is equal among all the tribes of Indians, civilized, or &s;avage. The only em|ployment of tho&s;e who have pre&s;erved their independ|ence is hunting and fi&s;hing. In &s;ome di&s;tricts, the women exerci&s;e a little agriculture, in rai&s;ing Indian corn, and pompions, of which they form a &s;pecies of aliment, by brui&s;ing them together: they, al&s;o, prepare the ordinary beverage among them, taking care, at the &s;ame time, of the children, of whom the fathers take no charge.</P>
<P>The female Indians of all the conquered regions of South America practi&s;e what is called the <HI>ur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u</HI> (a word which among them &s;ignifies <HI>elevation.</HI>) It con&s;i&s;ts in throwing forward the hair from the crown of the head, upon the brow, and cutting it round from the ears to above the eye; &s;o that the forehead and eye brows are entirely covered. The &s;ame cu&s;tom takes place in the Northern countries. The female inhabitants of both regions tie the re&s;t of their hair behind &s;o exactly in the &s;ame fa&s;hion, that it might be &s;uppo&s;ed the effect of mu|tual imitation. This, however, being impo&s;&s;ible, from the va&s;t di&s;tance that &s;eparates them, is thought to coun|tenance the &s;uppo&s;ition of the whole of America being originally planted with one race of people.</P>
<P>This cu&s;tom does not take place among the males. Tho&s;e of the higher parts of Peru wear long and flow|ing hair, which they reckon a great ornament. In the lower parts of the &s;ame country they cut it &s;hort, on ac|count of the heat of the climate; a circum&s;tance i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> which they imitate the Spaniards. The inhabitants of
<PB N="21" REF="028963_0010_0FDDBD3BADC529C0">Loui&s;iana pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ck out their hair by the roots, from the crown of the head forwards, in order to obtain a large forehead, otherwi&s;e denied them by nature. The re&s;t of their hair they cut as &s;hort as po&s;&s;ible, to prevent their enemies from &s;eizing them by it in battle, and al&s;o to prevent them from ea&s;ily getting their &s;calp, &s;hould they fall into their hands as pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>According to Don Ulloa, the whole race of the American Indians is di&s;tingui&s;hed by an uncommon thickne&s;s of &s;kin, and by an hardne&s;s of their fibres; which circum&s;tances, in the opinion of this learn|ned Spani&s;h writer, contribute to that in&s;en&s;ibility to bodily pain, for which the&s;e &s;ingular people are &s;o re|markable. Our author adduces an in&s;tance, in &s;upport of this in&s;en&s;ibility, in the Americans, in the ca&s;e of an Indian, who was under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ubmitting to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut for the &s;tone. This operation, it is well known, &s;eldom la&s;ts above four, or five, minutes. Unfavoura|ble circum&s;tances, in his ca&s;e, prolonged it to the un|common period of 27 minutes. Yet, all this time, the patient gave no tokens of the extreme pain, commonly attending this operation: he complained only as a per|&s;on does who feels &s;ome &s;light unea&s;ine&s;s. At la&s;t, the &s;tone was extracted. Two days after, he expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire for food, and on the eighth day from the opera|tion he quitted his bed, free from pain, although the wound was not yet thoroughly clo&s;ed. The &s;ame want of &s;en&s;ibility, he &s;ays, is ob&s;erved in ca&s;es of fractures, wounds, and other accidents, of a &s;imilar nature. In all the&s;e ca&s;es the cure is ea&s;ily effected, and they &s;eem <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o &s;uffer le&s;s pre&s;ent pain than any other race of men. The &s;kulls, which have been taken up in their ancient <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urying grounds, are of a greater thickne&s;s than that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ompages of bones is commonly found to be; being from &s;ix to &s;even lines from the outer to the inner &s;u|perficies.</P>
<P>It is natural to infer from hence, &s;ays Ulloa, that their comparative in&s;en&s;ibility to pain is owing to
<PB N="22" REF="028963_0011_0FDDBD3D24D30080">coar&s;er and &s;tronger organization, than that of other nations. The ea&s;e with which they endure the &s;everi|ties of climate is, he thinks, another proof of this, The inhabitants of the higher parts of Peru live amid&s;t perpetual fro&s;t and &s;now. Although their clothing i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> very &s;light, they &s;upport this inclement temperature, without the lea&s;t inconvenience. Habit, it is to be confe&s;&s;ed, may contribute a good deal to this, but much al&s;o is to be a&s;cribed to the compact texture of their &s;ki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> which defends them from the impre&s;&s;ion of cold through their pores. We mu&s;t confe&s;s, however, notwith&s;tand|ing the a&s;&s;ertions and conjectures of an author &s;o re&s;|pectable as Don Ulloa, that we are not very confident, that either the &s;kins, or the &s;kulls of the Americans are thicker than the &s;kins and &s;kulls of many other nations of mankind. But we do not wi&s;h, in this place, to ex|patiate on this &s;ubject, which can only be reduced to certainty by the inve&s;tigations of the anatomi&s;t or natu|rali&s;t.</P>
<P>The northern Indians re&s;emble them in this re&s;pect&punc; The utmo&s;t rigours of the winter &s;ea&s;on do not prevent them from following the chace almo&s;t naked. It is true, they wear a kind of woollen cloak, or &s;ometimes the &s;kin of a wild bea&s;t, upon their &s;houlders; but, be|&s;ides that it covers only a &s;mall part of their body, it would appear that they u&s;e it rather for ornament than warmth. In fact, they wear it indi&s;criminately, in the &s;everities of winter, and in the &s;ultrie&s;t heats of &s;ummer, when neither Europeans nor Negroes can &s;uf|fer any but the &s;lighte&s;t clothing. They even fre|quently throw a&s;ide this cloak when they go a hunting, that it may not embarra&s;s them, in traver&s;ing their fo|re&s;ts, where, they &s;ay, the thorns and undergrowth would take hold of it; while, on the contrary, they &s;lide &s;moothly over the &s;urface of their naked bodies. At all times they go with their heads uncovered, with|out &s;uffering the lea&s;t inconvenience, either from the
<PB N="23" REF="028963_0011_0FDDBD3D24D30080">cold, or from tho&s;e <HI>coups de &s;oleil,</HI> which in Loui&s;iana are &s;o often fatal to the inhabitants of other climates.</P>
<P>The Indians of South America di&s;tingui&s;h them|&s;elves by modern dre&s;&s;es, in which they affect various ta&s;tes. Tho&s;e of the high country, and of the vallies in Peru, dre&s;s partly in the Spani&s;h fa&s;hion. In&s;tead of hats they wear bonnets of coar&s;e double cloth, the weight of which neither &s;eems to incommode them when they go to warmer climates, nor does the acci|dental want of them &s;eem to be felt in &s;ituations where the mo&s;t piercing cold reigns. Their legs and feet are always bare, if we except a &s;ort of &s;andals made of the &s;kins of oxen. The inhabitants of South America, compared with tho&s;e of North America, are de&s;cribed as generally more feeble in their frame; le&s;s vigorous in the efforts of the mind; of gentler di&s;po&s;itions, more addicted to plea&s;ure, and &s;unk in indolence.&mdash;This, however, is not univer&s;ally the ca&s;e. Many of their nations are as intrepid and enterpri&s;ing as any others on the whole continent. Among the tribes on the banks of the Oroonoko, if a warrior a&s;pires to the po&s;t of captain, his probation begins with a long fa&s;t, more rigid than any ever ob&s;erved by the mo&s;t ab&s;temious hermit. At the clo&s;e of this the chiefs a&s;&s;emble; and each gives him three la&s;hes with a large whip, applied &s;o vigorou&s;ly, that his body is almo&s;t flayed. If he be|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rays the lea&s;t &s;ymptom of impatience, or even of &s;en&s;i|bility, he is di&s;graced, for ever, and is rejected as un|worthy of the honour. After &s;ome interval, his con|&s;tancy is proved by a more excruciating trial. He is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aid in his hammock with his hands bound fa&s;t; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n innumerable multitude of venomous ants, who&s;e bite occa&s;ions a violent pain and inflammation, are thrown <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pon him.

<P>Their huts, or cabins, are made of &s;takes of wood driven into the ground, and covered with branches of trees or reeds. They lie on the floor, either on mats, or the &s;kins of wild bea&s;ts. Their di&s;hes are of timber, but their &s;poons are made of the &s;kulls of wild oxen, and their knives of flint. A kettle and a large plate con&s;titute almo&s;t the whole uten&s;ils of the family.&mdash; Their diet con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in what they procure by hunting; and &s;agamite, or pottage, is likewi&s;e one of their mo&s;t common kinds of food.

<P>The character of the Indians is altogether founded upon their circum&s;tances and way of life. A people who are con&s;tantly employed in procuring the means of a precarious &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, who live by hunting the wild animals, and who are generally engaged in war with their neighbours, cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to enjoy much gaiety of temper or a high flow of &s;pirits. The Indians, therefore, are in general grave, even to &s;adne&s;s: they have nothing of that giddy vivacity peculiar to &s;ome nations of Europe, and they de&s;pi&s;e it. Their behaviour to tho&s;e about them is regular, mode&s;t, and re&s;pectful. Ignorant of the arts of amu&s;ement, of which that of &s;aying trifles agreeably is one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable, they &s;eldom &s;peak but when they have &s;omething important to ob&s;erve; and all their actions, words, and even looks, are attended with &s;ome meaning. This is extremely natural to men who are almo&s;t con|tinually engaged in pur&s;uits, which to them are of the highe&s;t importance. Their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence depends entire|ly only on what they procure with their hands; and, their lives, their honour, and every thing dear to them, may be lo&s;t by the &s;malle&s;t inattention to the de&s;igns of

<P>IF we except hunting and fi&s;hing, war is the princi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> employment of the Indian men: almo&s;t every oth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> concern, but in particular the little agriculture wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">
<PB N="29" REF="028963_0014_0FDDBD45E6A15010">they enjoy, is con&s;igned to the women. The mo&s;t common motive of the Americans for entering into war, when it does not ari&s;e from an accidental rencoun|ter, or interference, is either to revenge them&s;elves for the death of &s;ome lo&s;t friends, or to acquire pri&s;oners, who may a&s;&s;i&s;t them in hunting, and whom they adopt into their &s;ociety. The&s;e wars are either undertaken by &s;ome private adventurers, or at the in&s;tance of the whole community. In the latter ca&s;e all the young men who are di&s;po&s;ed to go out to battle (for no one is compelled contrary to his inclination), give a bit of wood to the chief, as a token of their de&s;ign to accompany him; for every thing among the&s;e people is tran&s;acted with a great deal of ceremony and with many forms. The chief, who is to conduct them, fa&s;ts &s;ev|eral days, during which time he conver&s;es with no one, and is particularly careful to ob&s;erve his dreams; which the pre&s;umption natural to &s;avages generally renders as favourable as he could de&s;ire. A variety of other &s;u|per&s;titions and ceremonies are ob&s;erved. One of the mo&s;t hideous is &s;etting the war kettle on the fire, as an emblem that they are going out to devour their enemies; which, among the&s;e nations, it is probable, was formerly the ca&s;e, &s;ince they &s;till continue to expre&s;s it in clear terms, and u&s;e an emblem &s;ignificant of the ancient u&s;age. Then they di&s;patch a porcelane, or large &s;hell, to their allies, inviting them to come along, and drink the blood of their enemies. For with the Americans, as with the Greeks of old,
<Q><L>"A generous friend&s;hip no cold medium knows;</L>
<L>"But with one love, with one re&s;entment glows".</L></Q> They think that tho&s;e in their alliance mu&s;t not only adopt their enmities, but that they mu&s;t al&s;o have their re|&s;entment wound up to the &s;ame pitch with them&s;elves. And, indeed, no people carry their friend&s;hips or their re&s;entments &s;o far as they do; and this is what &s;hould be expected from their peculiar circum&s;tances: that principle in human nature which is the &s;pring of the

They cut off, or pull out, all their hair, except a &s;pot about the breadth of two Engli&s;h crown pieces, near the top of their heads, and entirely de&s;troy their eye brows. The lock left upon their heads is divided into &s;everal parcels, each of which is &s;tiffened and adorned with wampum, beads, and feathers of various kinds, the whole being twi&s;ted into a form much re&s;embling the modern pompoon.

<P>The great qualities of an Indian war are vigilance and attention, to give and avoid a &s;urpri&s;e; and, indeed, in the&s;e they are &s;uperior to all nations in the world. Accu&s;tomed to continual wandering in the fore&s;ts; having their perceptions &s;harpened by keen nece&s;&s;ity, and living, in every re&s;pect, according to nature, their external &s;en&s;es have a degree of acutene&s;s which, at fir&s;t view, appears incredible. They can trace out their enemies, at an immen&s;e di&s;tance, by the &s;moke of their fires, which they &s;mell, and by the tracks of their feet upon the ground, imperceptible to an European eye,

They feel nothing for the enemies of their nation; and their re&s;entment is ea&s;ily extended, from the individual who has injured them, to all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">hers of the &s;ame tribe. The pri&s;oners, who have them&s;elves the &s;ame feelings, know the in|tentions of their conquerors, and are prepared for them. The per&s;on who has taken the captive attends him to the cottage, where, according to the di&s;tribution made by the elders, he is to be delivered to &s;upply the lo&s;s of a citizen. If tho&s;e who receive him have their family weakened by war or other accidents, they adopt the captive into the family, of which he becomes a mem|ber. But if they have no occa&s;ion for him, or their re|&s;entment for the lo&s;s of their friends be too high to endure the &s;ight of any connected with tho&s;e who were concerned in it, they &s;entence him to death. All tho&s;e who have met with the &s;ame &s;evere &s;entence being collect|ed, the whole nation is a&s;&s;embled at the execution, as for &s;ome great &s;olemnity. A &s;caffold is erected, and the pri&s;oners are tied to the &s;take, where they commence their death &s;ong, and prepare for the en&s;uing &s;cene of cruelty with the mo&s;t undaunted courage. Their ene|mies, on the other &s;ide, are determined to put it to the proof, by the mo&s;t refined and exqui&s;ite tortures. They begin at the extremity of his body, and gradually ap|proach the more vital parts. One plucks out his nails by the roots, one by one; another takes a &s;inger into his mouth, and tears off the fle&s;h with his teeth; a third thru&s;ts the finger, mangled as it is, into the bowl of a pipe made red hot, which he &s;mokes like tobacco; then they pound his toes and fingers to pieces between two &s;tones; they cut circles about his joints, and ga&s;h|es in the fle&s;hy parts of his limbs, which they &s;ear im|mediately with red hot irons, cutting, burning, and pinching them, alternately; they pull off his fle&s;h, thus mangled and roa&s;ted, bit by bit, devouring it with greedine&s;s, and &s;mearing their faces with the blood, in an enthu&s;ia&s;m of horrour and &s;ury. When they have
<PB N="35" REF="028963_0017_0FDDBD4ACFAFA3E8">thus torn off the fle&s;h, they twi&s;t the bare nerves and tendons about an iron, tearing and &s;napping them, whil&s;t others are employed in pulling and extending his limbs in every way that can increa&s;e the torment. This continues, often, five or &s;ix hours; and &s;ometimes, &s;uch is the &s;trength of the &s;avages, days together. Then they frequently unbind him, to give a breathing to their fury, to think what new torments they &s;hall in|flict, and to refre&s;h the &s;trength of the &s;uffere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, who, wearied out with &s;uch a variety of unheard of tor|ments, often falls into &s;o profound a &s;leep, that they are obliged to apply the fire to awake him, and renew his &s;ufferings.

<P>Their ta&s;te for war, which forms the chief ingredi|ent in their character, gives a &s;trong bias to their religion. <HI>Are&s;koui,</HI> or the god of battle, is revered as the great god of the Indians. Him they invoke before they go into the field; and according as his di&s;po&s;ition is more or le&s;s favourable to them, they conclude they will be more or le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful.

This, however, we think, we may, confidently and &s;afe|ly, a&s;&s;ert, that the condition of the women among many of the American tribes is as re&s;pectable and as impor|tant as it was among the Germans, in the days of Tac|itus; or as it is among any other nations, with whom we are acquainted, in a &s;imilar &s;tage of improvement. "Their bu&s;ine&s;s, or employment," &s;ays the ingenious Mr. William Bartram, "is chiefly in their hou&s;es, ex|cept at tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons when their crops of maize, &amp;c. are growing, at which times they generally turn out with their hu&s;bands and parents; but they are by no means compelled to do this, and one &s;eldom &s;ee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a third as many females as males at work, in their planta|tions." "You may depend on my a&s;&s;ertion," (&s;ays the &s;ame gentleman, who had ample opportunities of &s;tudy|ing the cu&s;toms and manners of the &s;outhern Indians, of whom he is &s;peaking, in this place) "that there are no people, any where, who love their women more than the&s;e Indians do, or men of better under&s;tanding in di&s;|tingui&s;hing the merits of the oppo&s;ite &s;ex;&mdash;or men more faithful in rendering &s;uitable compen&s;ation.

<P>"In the bunting &s;ea&s;ons, that is, in autumn, and in winter, when the men are generally out in the fore&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, the whole care of the hou&s;e or family devolves on the women: at the&s;e times they are obliged to undergo a great deal of labour and fatigue, &s;uch as cutting wood, &amp;c. But this labour is, in part alleviated by the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of the old men, who are pa&s;t their hunting days, or who are no longer capable of &s;erving in war." But nothing more clearly &s;hows the importance and re&s;pect|ability of the women among the Indians than this ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|cum&s;tance,

<P>Controver&s;ies among the Indians are few, and quick|ly decided. When any criminal matter is &s;o flagrant as to become a national concern, it is brought under the juri&s;diction of the great council; but in ordina<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> ca&s;es, the crime is either revenged or compromi&s;ed by the parties concerned. If a murder be committed, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> family which has lo&s;t a relation prepares to retaliate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that of the offender. They often kill the murderer;
<PB N="43" REF="028963_0021_0FDDBD54810D39E0">and when this happens, the kindred of the la&s;t per&s;on &s;lain, look upon them&s;elves to be as much injured, and to have the &s;ame right to vengeance, as the other par|ty. In general, however, the offender ab&s;ents him&s;elf; the friends &s;end compliments of condolence to tho&s;e of the per&s;on who has been murdered. The head of the family, at length, appears with a number of pre&s;ents, the delivery of which he accompanies with a formal &s;peech. The whole ends, as u&s;ual, in mutual fea&s;tings, in &s;ongs, and in dances. If the murder is committed by one of the &s;ame family, or cabin, that cabin has the full right of judgment within it&s;elf, either to puni&s;h the guilty with death, or to pardon him, or to oblige him to give &s;ome recompence to the wife or children of the &s;lain. In&s;tances of &s;uch a crime, however, very &s;el|dom happen; for their attachment to tho&s;e of the &s;ame family is remarkably &s;trong, and is &s;aid to produce &s;uch friend&s;hips as may vie with the mo&s;t celebrated in fabu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ous antiquity.</P>
<P>Such, in general, are the manners and cu&s;toms of the Indian nations; but almo&s;t every tribe has &s;omething peculiar to it&s;elf. Among the Hurons, and the Natch|es, the dignity of the chief is &s;aid to be hereditary, and the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the female line. When this happens to be extinct, the mo&s;t re&s;pectable matron of the tribe, we are informed, makes choice of whom &s;he plea&s;es to &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>The Cheerake are governed by &s;everal &s;achems, or chiefs, elected by the different villages; as are al&s;o the Creeks, and the Chactaws. The two latter puni&s;h adultery in a woman by cutting off her hair, which they will not &s;uffer to grow till the corn is ripe, the next &s;ea|&s;on; but the Illinois, for the &s;ame crime, cut off the woman's no&s;e and ears.</P>
<P>The Indians on the Lakes are formed into a &s;ort of em|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ire; and the emperor is elected from the elde&s;t tribe, which is that of the Ottawawas. This authority is ve|ry con&s;iderable. A few years ago, the per&s;on who held

<P>In general, the American Indians live to a great age, although it is not ea&s;y to know from them&s;elves the ex|act number of their years. It was a&s;ked of an Indian, who appeared to be extremely old, what age he was of? I am above twenty, was his reply. Upon putting the que&s;tion in a different form, by reminding him of cer|tain circum&s;tances, in former times, my <HI>machu,</HI> &s;aid he, &s;poke to me, when I was young, of the Ineas; and he had &s;een the&s;e princes. According to this reply, there mu&s;t have elap&s;ed, from the date of his machu's (his grandfather's) remembrance to that time, a period of, at lea&s;t, 232 years. The man who made this reply, ap|peared to be 120 years of age: for, be&s;ides the white|ne&s;s of his hair and beard, his body was almo&s;t bent to the ground; without, however, &s;howing any other marks of debility, or &s;uffering. This happened in 1764. This longevity, attended in general with uninterrupted health, is thought, by &s;ome writers, to be the cou&s;e|quence in part of their vacancy from all &s;erious thought and employment, joined al&s;o with the robu&s;t texture and conformation of their bodily organs. If the In|dians did not de&s;troy one another, in their almo&s;t per|petual wars, and if their habits of intoxication were not &s;o univer&s;al and incurable, they would be, of all the rac|es of men who inhabit the globe, the mo&s;t likely to ex|tend, not only the bounds, but the enjoyments, of ani|mal life to their utmo&s;t duration.</P>

<P>Perfidy combined with cruelty has been al&s;o made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> part of their character. Don Ulloa relates, That the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|dians called <HI>Natches,</HI> in Loui&s;iana, laid a plot of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;acring, in one night, every individual belonging <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the French colony e&s;tabli&s;hed there.

Such was the &s;ecrecy which
<PB N="49" REF="028963_0024_0FDDBD58F03051A8">they ob&s;erved, that no per&s;on had the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of their de&s;ign until the blow was &s;truck. One French|man alone e&s;caped, by favour of the darkne&s;s, to re|late the di&s;a&s;ter of his countrymen. The compa&s;&s;ion of a female Indian contributed al&s;o, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to his exemption from the general ma&s;&s;acre. The tribe of Natches had invited the Indians of other countries, even to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, to join in the &s;ame con|&s;piracy. The day, or rather the night, was fixed, on which they were to make an united attack on the French coloni&s;ts. It was intimated by &s;ending a parcel of rods, more or le&s;s numerous according to the local di&s;tance of each tribe, with an injunction to ab&s;tract one rod dai|ly; the day on which the la&s;t fell to be taken away be|ing that fixed for the execution of their plan. The women were partners of the bloody &s;ecret. The par|cels of rods being thus di&s;tributed, that belonging to the tribe of Natches happened to remain in the cu&s;tody of a female. This woman, either moved by her own feelings of compa&s;&s;ion, or by the commi&s;eration expre&s;|&s;ed by her female acquaintances, in the view of the propo&s;ed &s;cene of blood&s;hed, ab&s;tracted one day three or four of the rods, and thus anticipated the term of her tribe's proceeding to the execution of the general con&s;piracy. The con&s;equence of this was, that the Natches were the only actors in this carnage; their di&s;|tant a&s;&s;ociates having &s;till &s;everal rods remaining at the time when the former made the attack. An opportu|nity was, thereby, given to the coloni&s;ts, in tho&s;e quar|ters, to take mea&s;ures for their defence, and for pre|venting a more exten&s;ive execution of the de&s;ign.</P>
<P>It was by con&s;piracies &s;imilar to this that the Indians of the province of Macas, in the kingdom of Quito, de&s;troyed the opulent city of Logrogno, the colony of Guambaya, and its capital Sevilla del Oro; and that &s;o completely, that it is no longer known in what place the&s;e &s;ettlements exi&s;ted, or where that abundance of gold was found from which the la&s;t mentioned city took

The Peruvians, while they lived under the govern|ment of their Incas, pre&s;erved the records of certain remarkable events. They had al&s;o a kind of regular government de&s;cribed by the hi&s;torians of the conque&s;t of Peru. This government originated entirely from the attention and abilities of their princes, and from the regulations enacted by them for directing the con|duct of their &s;ubjects. This ancient degree of civili|zation among them gives ground to pre&s;ume that their legi&s;latures &s;prung from &s;ome race more enlightened than the other tribes of Indians; a race of which no individual &s;eems to remain in the pre&s;ent times.</P>
<P>Vanity and conceit are &s;aid to be blended with their ignorance, and treachery. Notwith&s;tanding all they &s;uffer from Europeans, they &s;till, it is &s;aid, con&s;ider them&s;elves as a race of men far &s;uperior to their con|querors. This proud belief, ari&s;ing from their pervert|ed ideas of excellence, is univer&s;al over the whole known continent of America. They do not think it po&s;&s;ible that any people can be &s;o intelligent as them&s;elves. When they are detected in any of their plots, it is their common ob&s;ervation, that the Spaniards, or <HI>Virochocas,</HI> want to be as knowing as they are. Tho&s;e of Loui|&s;iana and the countries adjacent, are equally vain of their &s;uperior under&s;tanding; confounding that quality with the cunning which they them&s;elves con&s;tantly practi&s;e. The whole object of their tran&s;actions is to over reach tho&s;e with whom they deal. Yet though faithle&s;s them&s;elves, they never forgive the breach of promi&s;e on the part of others. While the Europeans &s;eek their amity by pre&s;ents, they give them&s;elves no concern to &s;ecure a reciprocal friend&s;hip. Hence, pro|bably, ari&s;es their idea, that they mu&s;t be a &s;uperior race of men, in ability and intelligence, to tho&s;e who are at &s;uch pains to court their alliance, and avert their enmity.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="028963_0026_0FDDBD5BF88B1518">
Their natural eloquence has al&s;o been decried. The free tribes of &s;avages who enter into conventions with the Europeans, it is ob&s;erved, are accu&s;tomed to make long, pompous, and, according to their own notions, &s;ublime harangues, but without any method, or connec|tion. The whole is a collection of disjointed meta|phors and compari&s;ons. The light, heat, and cour&s;e of the &s;un, form the principal topic of their di&s;cour&s;e; and the&s;e unintelligible rea&s;onings are always accom|panied with violent and ridiculous ge&s;tures.

This pompous faculty of making &s;peeches is al&s;o one of the grounds on which they conceive them&s;elves to be &s;uperior to the nations of Europe; they imagine that it is their eloquence that procures them the favours they a&s;k.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>BUT &s;uch partial and detarched views, as the above, were they even free from mi&s;repre&s;entation, am not the ju&s;t ground upon which to form an e&s;timate of the character of the aboriginal inhabitants of the New World. Their qualities, good and bad, (for they cer|tainly po&s;&s;e&s;s both) their way of life, the &s;tate of &s;oci|ety among them, with all the circum&s;tances of their conditions, ought to be con&s;idered <HI>in connenion,</HI> and in regard to their mutual influence. Such a view has been given in the preceding part of this Book: From which, it is hoped, their real character may be ea&s;ily deduced.</P>
<P>Many of the di&s;agreeable traits exhibited in the a|necdotes ju&s;t quoted, are, indeed, extracted from Do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Ulloa; an author of credit and reputation; but a Span|iard, and evidently bia&s;&s;ed, in &s;ome degree, by a de|fire to palliate the enormities of his countrymen in that quarter of the globe. And, with regard to the wor&s;t and lea&s;t equivocal parts of the American character, cruelty and revenge; it may be fairly que&s;tioned, wheth|er the in&s;tances of the&s;e, either in re&s;pect of their cau&s;e or their atrocity, be at all comparable to tho&s;e exhibited in European hi&s;tory, and &s;taining the an|nals of Chri&s;tendom:&mdash;to tho&s;e, for in&s;tance, of the
<PB N="55" REF="028963_0027_0FDDBD61A3BBF6E8">Spaniards them&s;elves, at their fir&s;t di&s;covery of Amer|ica; to tho&s;e indicated by the engines found on board their mighty Armada, in 1588; to tho&s;e which, in cold blood, were perpetrated by the Dutch at Amboyna; to the dragoonings of the French; to their religious ma&s;&s;a|cres: Or, even to the <HI>tender mercies</HI> of the Inqui&s;ition!</P>
<P>Still har&s;her, however, are the de&s;criptions given by Buffon and de Pauw, of the natives of this whole con|tinent, in which the mo&s;t mortifying degeneracy of the human race, as well as of all the inferior animals, is a&s;|&s;erted to be con&s;picuous. Again&s;t the&s;e philo&s;ophers, or rather theori&s;ts, however, the Americans have found an able advocate in the Abb&eacute; Clavigero; an hi&s;torian, who, not only from his being a native of America, but al&s;o from his &s;ituation, and long re&s;idence in Mexico, has been enabled to obtain the be&s;t means of informa|tion, and who, though him&s;elf a &s;ubject of Spain, ap|pears &s;uperior to prejudice, and di&s;dains in his de&s;crip|tion the glo&s;&s;es of policy.</P>
<P>Concerning the &s;tature of the Americans, M. de Pauw &s;ays, that although, in general, it is not equal to the &s;tature of the Ca&s;tilians, there is but little differ|ence between them. But the Abb&eacute; Clavigero evinces, that the Indians who inhabit tho&s;e countries lying be|tween 9 and 40 degrees of north latitude, which are the limits of the di&s;coveries of the Spaniards, are more than five Pari&s;ian feet in height, and that tho&s;e who do not reach that &s;tature are as few in number among&s;t the Indians as they are among&s;t the Spaniards. It is be|&s;ides certain, that many of the American nations, &s;uch as the <HI>Apaches,</HI> the <HI>Hiaque&s;e,</HI> the <HI>Pime&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Cochi|mies,</HI> are at lea&s;t as tall as the talle&s;t Europeans; and that, in all the va&s;t extent of the New World, no race of people has been found, except the E&s;quimaux, in the north, and we&s;t, and the Yacana-cunnees, and Pe&s;&s;e|rais, &amp;c. in the &s;outh, &s;o diminutive in &s;tature as the Laplanders, the <HI>Samojeds,</HI> and Tartars, in the north of
<PB N="56" REF="028963_0028_0FDDBD6366CD3658">the Old Continent. In this re&s;pect, therefore, the in|habitants of the two Continents are upon an equality.</P>
<P>Of the &s;hape and character of the Mexican Indian the Abb&eacute; gives a mo&s;t advantageous de&s;cription; which he a&s;&s;erts, no one who reads it, in America, will contra|dict, unle&s;s he views them with the eye of a prejudicial mind. It is true, that Ulloa &s;ays, in &s;peaking of the Indians of Quito, he had ob&s;erved that "imperfect people abounded among them; that they were either irregularly diminutive, or mon&s;trous in &s;ome other to re&s;pect; that they became either in&s;en&s;ible, dumb, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> blind; or wanted &s;ome limb of their body." Having, therefore, made &s;ome inquiry re&s;pecting this &s;ingularity of the Quitans, the Abb&eacute; found, that &s;uch defect were neither cau&s;ed by what he calls bad humours, not by the climate, but by the mi&s;taken and blind human|ity of their parents, who, in order to free their chil|dren from the hard&s;hips and toils to which the healthy Indians are &s;ubjected by the Spaniards, fix &s;ome de|formity or weakne&s;s upon them, that they may become u&s;ele&s;s; a circum&s;tance of mi&s;ery which does not hap|pen in other countries of America, nor in tho&s;e places of the &s;ame kingdom of Quito, where the Indians are under no &s;uch oppre&s;&s;ion. M. de Pauw, and in agree|ment with him, Dr. Robert&s;on, &s;ays, that no deform|ed per&s;ons are to be found among the &s;avages of Amer|ica; becau&s;e, like the ancient Lacedemonians, they put to death tho&s;e children which are born hunch backed, blind, or defective in any limb; but that the tho&s;e countries where they are formed into &s;ocieties and where the vigilance of their rulers prevents the murder of &s;uch infants, the number of their deformed individuals is greater th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> it is in any country of Eu|rope. This would make an exceedingly good &s;olution of the difficulty if it were true: But if, po&s;&s;ibly, then has been in America a tribe of &s;avages who have imi|tated the barbarous example of the celebrated Lacede|monians, it is certain that tho&s;e authors have no ground
<PB N="57" REF="028963_0028_0FDDBD6366CD3658">to impute &s;uch inhumanity to the re&s;t of the Americans: and it has not been the practice, at lea&s;t with the far greater part of tho&s;e nations, as may be demon&s;trated from the atte&s;tations of authors who are the be&s;t ac|quainted with their cu&s;toms.</P>
<P>No argument again&s;t the New World can be drawn from the colour of the Americans; for their colour is le&s;s di&s;tant from the white of the Europeans than it is from the black of the Africans, and a great part of the Afraties. The hair of the Mexicans, and of the great|er part of the Indians, is, as we have already &s;aid, coar&s;e and thick; on their faces they appear to have little, and in general none on their arms and legs: But it is an er|ror to &s;ay, as M. de Pauw does, that they are entirely de&s;titute of hair in all the other parts of their body. This is one of the many pa&s;&s;ages in the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Re&s;earches,</HI> at which the Mexicans, and all the other nations, mu&s;t &s;mile, to find an European philo&s;opher &s;o eager to dive&s;t them of the dre&s;s they had from nature. Don Ulloa, indeed, in the de&s;cription which he gives of the Indians of Quito, &s;ays, that hair neither grows upon the men nor upon the women when they arrive at puberty, as it does on the re&s;t of mankind; but what|ever &s;ingularity may attend the Quitans, or occa&s;ion this circum&s;tance, there is no doubt that among the Amer|icans in general, the period of puberty is accompanied with the &s;ame &s;ymptoms as it is among other nations of the world. In fact, with the North Americans, it is di&s;graceful to be hairy on the body. They &s;ay, it likens them to hogs. They, therefore, pluck the hair as fa&s;t as it appears. But the traders who marry their wo|men, and prevail on them to di&s;continue this prac|tice, &s;ay, that nature is the fame with them as with the whites. As to the beards of the men, had Buf|fon, or de Pauw, known the pains and trouble it co&s;ts them to pluck out by the roots the hair that grows on their faces, they would have &s;een that nature had not been deficient in that re&s;pect. Every nation has its
<PB N="58" REF="028963_0029_0FDDBD6532BFAF18">cu&s;toms. "I have &s;een an Indian beau, with a look|ing gla&s;s in his hand (&s;ays Mr. Jeffer&s;on) examining his face, for hours together, and plucking out, by the roots, every hair he could di&s;cover, with a kind of tweezer made of a piece of fine bra&s;s wire, that had been twi&s;ted round a &s;tick, and which he u&s;ed with great dexterity."</P>
<P>The very a&s;pect of an Angolan, a Mandingan, or a Congan, would have &s;hocked M. de Pauw, and made him recal the cen&s;ure which he pa&s;&s;es on the colour, the make, and the hair of the Americans. What can be imagined more contrary to the idea <HI>we</HI> have of beauty, and the perfection of the human frame, than a man, who&s;e &s;kin is black as ink, who&s;e head and face are covered with black wool, in&s;tead of hair, who&s;e eyes are yellow and bloody, who&s;e lips are thick and black|i&s;h, and who&s;e no&s;e is flat? Such are the inhabitants of a very large portion of Africa, and of many i&s;lands of A&s;ia. What men can be more imperfect than tho&s;e who mea&s;ure no more than four feet in &s;tature, who&s;e faces are long and flat, the no&s;e compre&s;&s;ed, the iris yellowi&s;h black, the eyelids turned back towards the temples, the cheeks extraordinarily elevated, their mouths mon&s;trou&s;ly large, their lips thick and promi|nent, and the lower part of their vi&s;ages extremely narrow? Such, according to Count de Buffon, are the Laplanders, the Zemblans, the Borandines, the Samo|jeds, and the Tartars, in the Ea&s;t. What objects more deformed than men who&s;e faces are too long and wrink|led even in their youth, their no&s;es thick: and com|pre&s;&s;ed, their eyes &s;mall and &s;unk, their cheeks very much rai&s;ed, the upper jaw low, their teeth long and di&s;united, eyebrows &s;o thick that they &s;hade their eyes, the eyelids thick, &s;ome bri&s;tles on their faces in&s;tead of beard, large thighs and &s;mall legs? Such is the picture Count de Buffon gives of the Tartars; that is, of tho&s;e people who, as he &s;ays, inhabit a tract of land in A&s;ia, 1200 leagues long and upwards, and more than 750
<PB N="59" REF="028963_0029_0FDDBD6532BFAF18">broad. Among&s;t the&s;e, the Calmucks are the mo&s;t re|markable for their deformity; which is &s;o great, that, according to Tavernier, they are the mo&s;t brutal men of all the univer&s;e. Their faces are &s;o broad that there is a &s;pace of five, or &s;ix, inches between their eyes, as Count de Buffon him&s;elf affirms. In Calicut, in Ceylon, and in other countries of India, there is, &s;ay Pyrard, and other writers, on tho&s;e regions a race of men who have one, or both, of their legs as thick as the body of a man; and that this deformity among them is almo&s;t hereditary.</P>
<P>If we were, in like manner, to go through the na|tions of A&s;ia and Africa, we &s;hould hardly find any exten|&s;ive country where the colour of men is not darker, where there are not &s;tronger irregularities ob&s;erved, and gro&s;&s;er defects to be found in them, than even the penetrating eye of de Pauw could di&s;cover in the Amer|icans. The colour of the latter is a good deal clearer than that of almo&s;t all the Africans and the inhabitants of &s;outh A&s;ia. Even their alleged &s;cantine&s;s of beard is common to the inhabitants of the Philippine I&s;lands, and of all the Indian Archipelago, to the famous Chi|ne&s;e, Japane&s;e, Tartars, and many other nations of the Old Continent. The imperfections of the Ameri|cans, however great they may be repre&s;ented to be, are, certainly, not comparable with the defects of that im|men&s;e people, who&s;e character we have &s;ketched, and others whom we omit.</P>
<P>M. de Pauw repre&s;ents the Americans to be a fee|ble and di&s;ea&s;ed &s;et of nations; and, in order to demon|&s;trate the weakne&s;s and di&s;order of their phy&s;ical con|&s;titution, adduces &s;everal proofs equally ridiculous and ill founded, and which it will not be expected we &s;hould enumerate. He alleges, among other particulars, that they were overcome in wre&s;tling by all the Europeans, and that they &s;unk under a moderate burden; that by a computation made, 200,000 Americans were found to have peri&s;hed, in one year, from carrying of baggage.
<PB N="60" REF="028963_0030_0FDDBD6656249828">With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t point, the Abb&eacute; Clavigero ob|&s;erves, it would be nece&s;&s;ary that the experiment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> wre&s;tling was made between many individuals of each continent, and that the victory &s;hould be atte&s;ted by the Americans, as well as by the Europeans. It is not however, meant to in&s;i&s;t, that the Americans are &s;trong|er than the Europeans. They may be le&s;s &s;trong, with|out the human &s;pecies having degenerated in them. The Swi&s;s are &s;tronger than the Italians; and &s;till we do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> believe the Italians are degenerated, nor do we tax the cli|mate of Italy.

In the &s;ame manner that the&s;e 200,000 Amer|icans peri&s;hed, 200,000 Pru&s;&s;ians would al&s;o have per|i&s;hed, had they been obliged to make a journey <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> between 300 and 400 miles, with 100 pounds of bur|den upon their backs; if they had collars of iron about their necks, and were obliged to carry that load over rocks and mountains; if tho&s;e who became exhau&s;ted with fatigue, or wounded in their feet, &s;o as to impede their progre&s;s, had their heads out off that they might not retard the pace of the re&s;t; and if they were not allowed but a &s;mall mor&s;el of bread to enable them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;upport &s;o &s;evere a toil.

<PB N="61" REF="028963_0030_0FDDBD6656249828">Pauw &s;ays, that when the new world was di&s;covered, nothing was to be &s;een but thick woods; that, at pre|&s;ent, there are &s;ome lands cultivated, not by the Amer|icans, however, but by the Africans, and Europeans; and that the &s;oil in cultivation is to the &s;oil which is uncultivated as 2000 to 2,000,000. The&s;e three a&s;&s;er|tions the Abb&eacute; Clavigero demon&s;trates to be preci&s;ely &s;o many errors. Since the conque&s;t, the Americans alone have been the people who have &s;upported all the fatigues of agriculture in all the va&s;t countries of the continent of South America, and in the greater part of tho&s;e of North America &s;ubject to the crown of Spain. No European is ever to be &s;een employed in the labours of the field. The Moors who, in compari&s;on of the Americans, are very few in number in the kingdom of New Spain, are charged with the culture of the &s;ugar cane, and tobacco, and the making of fugar; but the &s;oil de&s;tined for the cultivation of tho&s;e plants is not with re&s;pect to all the cultivated land of that country, in the proportion of one to two thou&s;and. The Amer|icans are the people who labour on the &s;oil. They are the tillers, the &s;owers, the weeders, and the reap|ers of the wheat, of the maize, of the rice, of the beans, and other kinds of grain or pul&s;e, of the cocoa, of the vanilla, of the cotton, of the indigo, and all other plants u&s;eful to the &s;u&s;tenance, the clothing, and commerce of tho&s;e provinces; and without them &s;o little can be done, that in the year 1762, the harve&s;t of wheat was abandoned, in many places, on account of a &s;ickne&s;s which prevailed, and prevented the Indians from reaping it. But this is not all; the Americans are they who cut and tran&s;port all the nece&s;&s;ary timber from the woods; who cut, tran&s;port, and work the &s;tones; who make lime, pla&s;ter, and tiles; who con&s;truct all the buildings of that kingdom, except a few places where none of them inhabit; who open and repair all the roads, who make the canals and &s;luices, and clean the cities.

Hi&s;torians, and other per&s;ons who have &s;ojourned there for many years, report the &s;ame thing of other countries of the New World.</P>
<P>As to the mental qualities of the Americans, M. de Pauw has not been able to di&s;cover any other characters than a memory &s;o feeble, that to day they do not re|member what they did ye&s;terday; a capacity &s;o blunt, that they are incapable of thinking or putting their ideas in order; a di&s;po&s;ition &s;o cold, that they feel no excitement of love; a da&s;tardly &s;pirit, and a genius that is torpid, and indolent. Many other Europeans, in|deed, and what is &s;till more wonderful, many of tho&s;e children or de&s;cendants of Europeans who are born in America, think as M. de Pauw does; &s;ome from igno|rance, &s;ome from want of reflection, and others from hereditary prejudice and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. But all this, and much more, would not be &s;ufficient to invalidate the te&s;|timonies of other Europeans who&s;e authority has a great deal more weight, both becau&s;e they were men of great judgment, learning, and knowledge, of the&s;e countries, and becau&s;e they give their te&s;timony in fa|vour of &s;trangers, again&s;t their own countrymen. In particular, Aco&s;ta, who&s;e <HI>Natural and Moral Hi&s;tory</HI> even de Pauw commends, as <HI>an excellent work,</HI> employs the whole &s;ixth book in demon&s;trating the good &s;en&s;e of the Americans, by an explanation of their ancient gov|ernment, their laws, their hi&s;tories in paintings and knots, calendars, &amp;c. M. de Pauw thinks the Ameri|cans are be&s;tial; Aco&s;ta, on the other hand, reputes tho&s;e per&s;ons weak and pre&s;umptuous who think them &s;o. M. de Pauw &s;ays, that the mo&s;t acute Americans were inferior in indu&s;try and &s;agacity to the rude&s;t na|tions
<PB N="64" REF="028963_0032_0FDDBD6970643AB8">of the Old Continent: Aco&s;ta extols the civil gov|ernment of the Mexicans above many republics of Europe. M. de Pauw finds, in the moral and political conduct of the Americans, nothing but barbarity, ex|travagance, and brutrlity; and Aco&s;ta finds there, laws which are admirable and worthy of being pre&s;erved for|ever.</P>
<P>M. de Pauw denies them courage, and alleges the conque&s;t of Mexico as a proof of their cowardice. "Cortes (&s;ays he) conquered the empire of Mexico with 450 vagabonds, and 15 hor&s;es, badly armed; his mi&s;erable artillery con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ix falconets, which would not at the pre&s;ent day be capable of exciting the fears of a fortre&s;s defended by invalids. During his ab&s;ence, the capital was held in awe by the half of his troops. What men! what events!&mdash;It is confirmed by the de|po&s;itions of all hi&s;torians, that the Spaniards entered, the fir&s;t time, into Mexico without making one &s;ingle di&s;|charge of their artillery. If the title of hero is appli|cable to him who has the di&s;grace to occa&s;ion the death of a great number of rational animals, Ferdinand Cor|tes might pretend to it; otherwi&s;e I do not &s;ee what true glory he has acquired by the overthrow of a tot|tering monarchy, which might have been de&s;troyed, in the &s;ame manner, by any other a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in of our continent." The&s;e pa&s;&s;ages indicate either M. de Pauw's ignorance of the hi&s;tory of the conque&s;t of Mexico, or a wilful &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of what would openly contradict his &s;y&s;tem; &s;ince all who have read that hi&s;tory know well, that the conque&s;t of Mexico was not made with 450 men, but with more than 200,000. Cortes him&s;elf, to whom it was of more importance than to M. de Pauw to make his bravery con&s;picuous, and his conque&s;t appear glo|rious, confe&s;&s;es the exce&s;&s;ive number of the allies who were under his command, at the &s;iege of the capital, and combated with more fury again&s;t the Mexicans than the Spaniards them&s;elves. According to the account which Cortes gave to the emperor Charles V. the &s;iege,
<PB N="65" REF="028963_0032_0FDDBD6970643AB8">of Mexico began with 87 hor&s;es, 848 Spani&s;h infantry, armed with guns, cro&s;s bows, &s;words, and lances, and upwards of 75,000 allies, of Tla&s;cala, Huexotzinco, Cholula, and Chalco, equipped with various &s;orts of arms; with three large pieces of cannon of iron, 15 &s;mall of copper, and 13 brigantines. In the cour&s;e of the &s;iege were a&s;&s;embled the numerous nations of the Otomies, the Cohuixcas, and Matlazincas, and the troops of the populous cities of the lakes; &s;o that he army of the be&s;iegers not only exceeded 200,000, but amounted to 400,000, according to the letter from Cortes; and be&s;ides the&s;e, 3000 boats and canoes came to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Did it betray cowardice to have &s;u&s;tained, for full 75 days, the &s;iege of an open city, engaging daily, with an army &s;o large, and in part provided with arms &s;o &s;uperior, and at the &s;ame time having to with&s;tand the ravages of famine? Can they merit the charge of cowardice, who, after having lo&s;t &s;even of the eight parts of their city, and about 50,000 citizens, part cut off by the &s;word, part by famine and &s;ickne&s;s, continued to defend them&s;elves until they were furiou&s;ly a&s;&s;aulted in the la&s;t hold which was left them?</P>
<P>The following in&s;tances of courage, fortitude and cloquence, will &s;how how unju&s;tly their character has been defamed. "The Mexicans, fearing that the city would be taken, and perceiving that there mu&s;t &s;oon be a total want of provi&s;ions, turned their attention to the pre&s;ervation of their emperour, Gautimo&s;in. He con|&s;ented to attempt his of cape, with a view of maintaining the war in the northern part of his dominions. To fa|cilitate his retreat, a party of his &s;oldiers generou&s;ly de|voted them&s;elves to death, by diverting the attention of the be&s;iegers: But the canoe, in which this generous and unfortunate monarch had embarked, was taken on the lake by a brigantine. An officer of the Spani&s;h revenue &s;u&s;pecting that he had trea&s;ures con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ealed, ordered him to be extended upon red hot coals, to extort a

One of his officers, who underwent the &s;ame torture, complaining to him of his &s;ufferings, the empe|rour &s;aid, "Am I on a bed of ro&s;es?" An expre&s;&s;ion equal to any of tho&s;e which hi&s;tory has recorded, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> worthy the admiration of mankind."</P>
<P>According to M. de Pauw, "The Americans at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> were not believed to be men, but rather &s;atyrs, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> large apes, which might be murdered, without re|mor&s;e, or reproach."</P>
<P>But, if, at fir&s;t, the Americans were e&s;teemed &s;aty<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> nobody can better prove it than Chri&s;topher Columb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> their di&s;coverer.

<P>"We have had intimate commerce with the Amer|icans (continues the Abb&eacute;) have lived, for &s;ome years, in a &s;eminary de&s;tined for their in&s;truction; &s;aw the erection and progre&s;s of the royal college of Guad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|loupe founded, in Mexico, by a Mexican Je&s;uit, for the education of Indian children; had, afterwards, &s;ome In|dians among our pupils; had particular knowledge of many American rectors, many nobles, and numerous arti&s;ts; attentively, ob&s;erved their character, their gen|ius, their di&s;po&s;ition, and manner of thinking; and have examined, be&s;ides, with the utmo&s;t diligence, their ancient hi&s;tory, their religion, their government, their
<PB N="67" REF="028963_0033_0FDDBD70DD8D1810">laws, and their cu&s;toms. After &s;uch long experience and &s;tudy of them, from which we imagine our&s;elves enabled to decide, without danger of erring, we declare to M. de Pauw, and to all Europe, that the mental qual|ities of the Americans are not in the lea&s;t inferior to tho&s;e of the Europeans; that they are capable of all, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> he mo&s;t ab&s;tract, &s;ciences; and that if equal care <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> taken of their education, if they were brought up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> childhood in &s;eminaries, under good ma&s;ters, were protected and &s;timulated by rewards, we &s;hould &s;ee ri&s;e among the Americans, philo&s;ophers, mathematicians, and divines, who would rival the fir&s;t in Europe."</P>
<P>But, although we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, that, in the torrid climates of the New World, as well as in tho&s;e of the Old, e&s;pecially under the additional depre&s;&s;ion of &s;la|very, there was an inferiority of the mental powers; the Chile&s;e, and the North Americans, have di&s;covered higher rudiments of human excellence and ingenuity than have, perhaps, ever been known among tribes in a &s;imilar &s;tate of &s;ociety, in any part of the world.</P>
<P>M. de Pauw affirms, that the Americans were unac|quainted with the u&s;e of money, and quotes the follow|ing well known pa&s;&s;age from Monte&s;quieu: "Imagine to your&s;elf that, by &s;ome accident, you are placed in an unknown country; if you find money there, do not doubt that you are arrived among a poli&s;hed people." But, if by money we are to under&s;tand a piece of metal with the &s;tamp of the prince, or of the public, the want of it in a nation is no token of barbarity. The Athe|nians employed oxen for money, as the Romans did &s;heep. The Romans had no coined money till the time of Servius Tullius, nor had the Per&s;ians until the reign of Darius Hy&s;tap&s;es. But, if by money is under&s;tood a &s;ign repre&s;enting the value of merchandize, the Mex|icans, and other nations of Anahuac, employed money in their commerce. The cacao, of which they made con&s;tant u&s;e in the market to purcha&s;e whatever they wanted, was employed for this purpo&s;e, as &s;alt is in Aby&s;&s;inia.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="028963_0034_0FDDBD7328F74630">
It has been affirmed, that &s;tone bridges were unknow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in America, when it was fir&s;t di&s;covered; and that the natives did not know how to form arches.

<P>M. de Pauw affirms, that the palace of Montezum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was nothing el&s;e than a <HI>hut.</HI> But, it is certain, from the affirmation of all the hi&s;torians of Mexico, that the army under Cortes, con&s;i&s;ting of 6,400 men, were all lodged in the palace; and there remained &s;till &s;ufficient room for Montezuma and his attendants.</P>
<P>The advances which the Mexicans had made in the noble &s;cience of a&s;tronomy, is, perhaps, the mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;|ing proof of their attention and &s;agacity; for it appears from Abb&eacute; Clavigero's Hi&s;tory, that they not only counted 365 days to the year, but al&s;o knew of the ex|ce&s;s of about &s;ix hours in the &s;olar over the civil year, and remedied the difference, by means of intercalary days.</P>
<P>Of American morality, the following exhortation of a Mexican to his &s;on may &s;erve as a &s;pecimen. "My &s;on, who art come into the light from the womb of thy mother like a chicken from the egg, and, like it, art preparing to fly through the world, we know not how long Heaven will grant to us the enjoyment of that precious gem which we po&s;&s;e&s;s in thee; but how|ever &s;hort the period, endeavour to live exactly, pray|ing God continually to a&s;&s;i&s;t thee.

<P>"Mock not, my &s;on, the aged, or the imperfect.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS ranging on the &s;ame &s;ide with the Abb&eacute; Clavi|gero, our countryman Mr. Jeffer&s;on de&s;erves par|ticular attention. This gentleman, in his <HI>Notes on the State of Virginia,</HI> &amp;c. has taken occa&s;ion to com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> the opinions of Buffon; and &s;eems, in many in&s;tanc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to have fully refuted them, both by argument and by facts.</P>
<P>Of the inhabitants of America, the French philo&s;ophe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> gives the following de&s;cription: "Though the Ameri|can &s;avage be nearly of the &s;ame &s;tature with men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> poli&s;hed &s;ocieties; yet this is not a &s;ufficient exception to the general contraction of animated Nature through|out the whole continent. In the &s;avage, the organs of generation are &s;mall and feeble. He has no hair, no beard, no ardour for the female. Though nimble<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> than the European, becau&s;e more accu&s;tomed to run|ning, his &s;trength is not &s;o great. His &s;en&s;ations are le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> acute; and yet he is more timid and cowardly. He has no vivacity, no activity of mind. The activity of his body is not &s;o much an exerci&s;e or &s;pontaneous mo|tion, as a nece&s;&s;ary action produced by want. De&s;troy his appetite for victuals and drink, and you will, at once, annihilate the active principle of all his movements: he remains in &s;tupid repo&s;e, on his limbs, or couch, for whole days. It is ea&s;y to di&s;cover the cau&s;e of the &s;cattered life of &s;avages, and of their e&s;trangement from &s;ociety. They have been refu&s;ed the mo&s;t pre|cious
<PB N="71" REF="028963_0035_0FDDBD74AAF4A4A0">&s;park of Nature's fire: They have no ardour for women, and of cour&s;e, no love to mankind. Unac|quainted with the mo&s;t lively and the mo&s;t tender of all attachments, their other &s;en&s;ations of this nature are cold and languid. Their love to parents and children is extremely weak. The bonds of the mo&s;t intimate of all &s;ocieties, that of the &s;ame family, are feeble; and one family has no attachment to another. Hence no union, no republic, no &s;ocial &s;tate can take place among&s;t them. The phy&s;ical cau&s;e of love gives ri&s;e to the morality of their manners. Their heart is frozen, their &s;ociety cold, and their empire cruel. They regard their families as &s;ervants de&s;tined to labour, or as bea&s;ts of burden, whom they load unmercifully with the pro|duce of their hunting, and oblige, without pity or grat|itude, to perform labours which often exceed their &s;trength. They have few children, and pay little at|tention to them. Every thing mu&s;t be referred to the fir&s;t cau&s;e: They are indifferent becau&s;e they are weak; and this indifference to the &s;ex is the original &s;tain which di&s;graces Nature; prevents her from expanding, and by de&s;troying the germs of life, cuts the root of &s;ociety. Hence, man makes no exception to what has been advanced. Nature, by denying him the faculty of love, has abu&s;ed and contracted him more than any other animal."</P>
<P>An humiliating picture, indeed! but than which, Mr. Jeffer&s;on a&s;&s;ures us, never was one more unlike the original. M. Buffon grants, that their &s;tature is the &s;ame as that of the men of Europe, and he might have admitted, that the Iroquois were larger, and the Le|nopi, or Delawares, taller, than people in Europe gen|erally are. But, he &s;ays, their organs of generation are &s;maller and weaker than tho&s;e of Europeans; which is not <HI>known,</HI> at lea&s;t, to be a fact. And as to their want of beard, this error has been already noticed.</P>
<P>"They have no ardour for their females." It is true, they do not indulge tho&s;e exce&s;&s;es, nor di&s;cover that fond|ne&s;s,
<PB N="72" REF="028963_0036_0FDDBD7620F79728">which are cu&s;tomary in Europe; but this is not ow|ing to a defect in nature, but to manners. The &s;oul of the Indian is wholly bent upon war. This is what pro|cures him glory among&s;t the men, and makes him the ad|miration of the women. To this he is educated, from his earlie&s;t youth. When he pur&s;ues game with ardour, when he bears the fatigues of the chace, when he &s;u&s;tains and &s;uffers patiently hunger and cold; it is not &s;o much for the &s;ake of the game he pur&s;ues, as to convince his parents and the council of the nation, that he is fit to be enrolled in the number of the warriors. The &s;ongs of the women, the dance of the warriors, the &s;age coun&s;el of the chiefs, the tales of the old, the trium|phant entry of the warriors returning, with &s;ucce&s;s, from battle, and the re&s;pect paid to tho&s;e who di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves in battle, and in &s;ubduing their enemies; in &s;hort, every thing he &s;ees or hears tends to in&s;pire the Indian with an ardent de&s;ire for military fame. If a young man were to di&s;cover a fondne&s;s for women before he has been to war, he would become the con|tempt of the men, and the &s;corn and ridicule of the women; or were he to indulge him&s;elf with a captive taken in war, and much more were he to offer violence in order to gratify his lu&s;t, he would incur indelible di&s;grace. The &s;eeming frigidity of the American, therefore, is the effect of manners, and not a defect of nature. He is neither more defective in ardour, nor impotent with the female, than a white man reduced to the &s;ame diet and exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>"They rai&s;e few children."&mdash;They, indeed, rai&s;e fewer children than we do; the cau&s;es of which are to be found, not in a difference of nature, but of circum|&s;tance. The women very frequently attending the men in their parties of war and of hunting, child bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ing becomes extremely inconvenient to them. It is &s;aid, therefore, that they have learned the practice of procuring abortion by the u&s;e of certain vegetables; and that they even tend to prevent conception for a con|&s;iderable
<PB N="73" REF="028963_0036_0FDDBD7620F79728">time after. During the&s;e parties, they are expo&s;ed to numerous hazards, to exce&s;&s;ive exertions, to the greate&s;t extremities of hunger. Even at their homes the nation depends for food, through a certain part of every year, on the gleanings of the fore&s;t; that is, they experience a famine once in every year. With all animals, if the female be badly fed, or not fed at all, her young peri&s;h: and if both male and female be reduced to like want, generation becomes le&s;s active, le&s;s productive. To the ob&s;tacles, then, of want and hazard, which nature has oppo&s;ed to the multiplication of wild animals for the purpo&s;e of re&s;training their numbers within certain bounds, tho&s;e of labour and of voluntary abortion are added with the Indian. No wonder, then, if they multiply le&s;s than we do. Where food is regularly &s;upplied, a &s;ingle farm will &s;how more of cattle than a whole country of fore&s;ts can of buffa|loes. The &s;ame Indian women, when married to white traders, who feed them and their children plen|tifully and regularly, who exempt them from exce&s;&s;ive drudgery, who keep them &s;tationary and unexpo&s;ed to accidents, produce, and rai&s;e, as many children as the white women. In&s;tances are known, under the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances, of their rearing a dozen children.</P>
<P>Neither do they &s;eem to be "deficient in natural affection." On the contrary their &s;en&s;ibility is keen, even the warriors weeping mo&s;t bitterly on the lo&s;s of their children, though, in general, they endeavour to appear &s;uperior to human events.</P>
<P>Their friend&s;hips are &s;trong, and faithful to the ut|termo&s;t extremity. A remarkable in&s;tance of this ap|peared in the ca&s;e of the late Col. Byrd of Virginia, who was &s;ent to the Cheerakee nation to tran&s;act &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s with them. It happened that &s;ome of our di&s;|orderly people had ju&s;t killed one or two of that na|tion. It was, therefore, propo&s;ed in the council of the Cheerakee, that Col. Byrd &s;hould be put to death in re|venge for the lo&s;s of their countrymen. Among&s;t them
<PB N="74" REF="028963_0037_0FDDBD77CB8A7F90">was a chief called Sil&ograve;uee, who on &s;ome former occa|&s;ion, had contracted an acquaintance and friend&s;hip with Col. Byrd. He came to him every night, in his tent, and told him not to be afraid, they &s;hould not kill him. After many days deliberation, however, the determin|ation was, contrary to Sil&ograve;uee's expectation, that Byrd &s;hould be put to death, and &s;ome warriors were di&s;|patched a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> executioners. Sil&ograve;uee attended them; and when they entered the tent, he threw him&s;elf be|tween them and Byrd, and &s;aid to the warriors, "This man is my friend; before you get at him, you mu&s;t kill me." On which they returned; and the council re&s;pected the principle &s;o much as to recede from their determination.</P>
<P>That "they are timorous and cowardly" is a char|acter with which there is little rea&s;on to charge them, when we recollect the manner in which the Iroquois met Mon&s;. &mdash;, who marched into their country; in which the old men, who &s;corned to fly or to &s;urvive the capture of their town, braved death, like the old Romans, in the time of the Gauls, and in which they &s;oon after revenged them&s;elves by &s;acking and de&s;troy|ing Montreal. In &s;hort, the Indian is brave, when an enterprize depends on bravery; education with him making the point of honour to con&s;i&s;t in the de&s;truction of an enemy by &s;tratagem, and in the pre&s;ervation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> his own per&s;on free from injury: or, perhaps, this is na|ture, while it is education which teaches us to honour force more than fine&s;&s;e. He will defend him&s;elf again&s;t an ho&s;t of enemies, always chu&s;ing to be killed rather than to &s;urrender, though it be to the whites, who, he knows, will treat him well. In other &s;ituations, al&s;o, he meets death with more deliberation; and endures tortures with a firmne&s;s unknown almo&s;t to religious en|thu&s;ia&s;m among&s;t us.</P>
<P>Much le&s;s are they to be characterized as a people of no vivacity, and who are excited to action or motion only by the calls of hunger and thir&s;t. Their dances,
<PB N="75" REF="028963_0037_0FDDBD77CB8A7F90">in which they &s;o much delight, and which to a Euro|pean would be the mo&s;t &s;evere exerci&s;e, fully contradict this; not to mention their fatiguing marches, and the toil they voluntarily and cheerfully undergo in their military expeditions. It is true, that when at home they do not employ them&s;elves in labour or the culture of the &s;oil: But this, again, is the effect of cu&s;toms and manners which have a&s;&s;igned that to the province of the women. But it is &s;aid, "They are aver&s;e to &s;ociety and a &s;ocial life." Can any thing be more inapplicable than this, to a people who always live in towns, or in clans? Or can they be &s;aid to have no <HI>republique,</HI> who conduct all their affairs in national councils; who pride them&s;elves in their national character; who con&s;ider an in&s;ult or injury, done to an individual by a &s;tranger, as done to the whole, and re&s;ent it, accordingly?</P>
<P>To form a ju&s;t e&s;timate of their genius and men|tal powers, Mr. Jeffer&s;on ob&s;erves, more facts are wanting, and great allowance is to be made for tho&s;e circum&s;tances of their &s;ituation which call for a di&s;|play of particular talents only. This done, we &s;hall, probably, find that the Americans are formed, in mind as well as in body, on the &s;ame model with the <HI>homo &s;apiens Europaeus.</HI> The principles of their &s;ociety forbidding all compul&s;ion, they are to be led to duty and to enterprize by per&s;onal influence and per&s;ua&s;ion. Hence eloquence in council, bravery and addre&s;s in war, become the foundations of all con&s;equence with them. To the&s;e acquirements all their faculties are directed. Of their bravery and addre&s;s in war we have multiplied proofs, becau&s;e we have been the &s;ubjects on which they were exerci&s;ed. Of their eminence in oratory we have fewer examples, becau&s;e it is di&s;played chiefly in their own councils. Some, however, we have of very &s;uperior lu&s;tre.

The &s;tory is as follows; of which, and of the &s;peech, the authenticity is unque&s;tionable. In the &s;pring of the year 1774, a robbery and murder were committed on an inhabitant of the frontiers of Virginia, by two Indians, of the Shawanae tribe. The neighbouring whites, according to their cu&s;tom, under|took to puni&s;h this outrage in a &s;ummary way.

In the autumn of the &s;ame year, a deci&s;ive battle was fought at the mouth of the Great Kanhaway, between the collected forces of the Shawanaes, Mingoes, and Delawares, and a detachment of the Virginia militia.

For my country, I rejoice at the beams of peace; but do not harbour a thought that mine is the joy of fear. Logan never felt fear. He will not turn on his heel to &s;ave his life. Who is there to mourn for Logan? Not one."</P>
<P>To the preceding anecdotes, in favour of the Amer|ican character, may be added the following, by Dr. Benjamin Franklin.&mdash;The Indian men, when young, are hunters and warriors; when old, coun&s;ellors; for all their government is by the coun&s;el or advice of the &s;ages. Hence, they generally &s;tudy oratory; the be&s;t &s;peakers having the mo&s;t influence. The Indian wo|men till the ground, dre&s;s the food, nur&s;e and bring up the children, and pre&s;erve and hand down to po&s;ter|ity the memory of public tran&s;actions. The&s;e em|ployments of men and women are accounted natural and honourable. Having few artificial wants, they have abundance of lei&s;ure for improvement by conver|&s;ation. Our laborious manner of life, compared with theirs, they e&s;teem &s;lavi&s;h and ba&s;e; and the learning on which we value our&s;elves, they regard as frivolous and u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>Having frequent occa&s;ions to hold public councils, they have acquired great order and decency in conduct|ing them. The old men &s;it in the foremo&s;t rank, the warriors in the next, and the women and children in the hindmo&s;t. The bu&s;ine&s;s of the women is to take exact notice of what pa&s;&s;es; imprint it in their memo|ries, for they have no writing, and communicate it to their children. They are the records of the council,
<PB N="78" REF="028963_0039_0FDDBD7AA777B6C8">and they pre&s;erve tradition of the &s;tipulations in trea|ties a hundred years back; which, when we compare with our writings, we always find exact. He that would &s;peak, ri&s;es. The re&s;t ob&s;erve a profound &s;ilence. When he has fini&s;hed, and &s;its down, they leave him five or &s;ix minutes to recollect, that if he has omitted any thing he intended to &s;ay, or has any thing to add&punc; he may ri&s;e again and deliver it. To interrupt another even in common conver&s;ation, is reckoned highly inde|cent.</P>
<P>The politene&s;s of the&s;e &s;avages in conver&s;ation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> indeed, carried to exce&s;s; &s;ince it does not permit them to contradict, or deny, the truth of what is a&s;|&s;erted in their pre&s;ence. By the&s;e means they, indeed, avoid di&s;putes; but then it becomes difficult to know their minds, or what impre&s;&s;ion you make upon them. The mi&s;&s;ionaries, who have attempted to convert them to chri&s;tianity, all complain of this, as one of the great difficulties of their mi&s;&s;ion. The Indians hear, with pa|tience, the truths of the go&s;pel explained to them, and give their u&s;ual tokens of a&s;&s;ent and approbation; but this by no means implies conviction; it is mere civ|ility.</P>
<P>When any of them come into our towns, our people are apt to crowd round them, gaze upon them, and in|commode them when they de&s;ire to be private; this they e&s;teem great rudene&s;s, and the effect of the want of in&s;truction in the rules of civility, and good manners. "We have," &s;ay they, "as much curio&s;ity as you; and when you come into our towns, we wi&s;h for op|portunities of looking at you; but for this purpo&s;e we hide our&s;elves behind bu&s;hes where you are to pa&s;s, and never intrude our&s;elves into your company."</P>
<P>Their manner of entering one another's villages has likewi&s;e its rules. It is reckoned uncivil in travelling &s;trangers to enter a village abruptly, without giving notice of their approach. Therefore, as &s;oon as the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> arrive within hearing, they &s;top and hollow, remaining
<PB N="79" REF="028963_0039_0FDDBD7AA777B6C8">there till invited to enter. Two old men u&s;ually come out to them, and lead them in. There is in every vil|lage a vacant dwelling, called the <HI>&s;tranger's hou&s;e.</HI> Here they are placed, while the old men go round from hut to hut, acquainting the inhabitants that &s;trangers are arrived, who are, probably, hungry and weary; and every one &s;ends them what he can &s;pare of victuals, and &s;kins to repo&s;e on. When the &s;trangers are refre&s;hed, pipes and tobacco are brought; and then, but not be|fore, conver&s;ation begins, with inquiries who they are, whither bound, what news, &amp;c. and it u&s;ually ends with offers of &s;ervice; if the &s;trangers have occa&s;ion for guides, or any nece&s;&s;aries, for continuing their jour|ney; and nothing is exacted for the entertainment.</P>
<P>The &s;ame ho&s;pitality, e&s;teemed among them as a principal virtue, is practi&s;ed by private per&s;ons; of which Conrad Wei&s;er, a celebrated interpreter of the Indian languages, gave Dr. Franklin the following in|&s;tance. He had been naturalized among the Six Na|tions, and &s;poke well the Mohawk language. In going through the Indian country, to carry a me&s;&s;age from our governour to the council at Onondaga, he called at the habitation of Cana&s;&s;etego, an old acquaintance, who em|braced him, &s;pread furs for him to &s;it on, placed before him &s;ome boiled beans and veni&s;on, and mixed &s;ome rum and water for his drink. When he was well re|fre&s;hed, and had lit his pipe, Cana&s;&s;etego began to con|ver&s;e with him; a&s;ked how he had fared the many years &s;ince they had &s;een each other, whence he then came, what had occa&s;ioned the journey, &amp;c. Conrad an&s;wered all his que&s;tions; and when the di&s;cour&s;e be|gan to flag, the Indian, to continue it, &s;aid, "Conrad, you have lived long among the white people, and know &s;omething of their cu&s;toms; I have been &s;ometimes at Albany, and have ob&s;erved that once in &s;even days they &s;hut up their &s;hops, and a&s;&s;emble all in the great hou&s;e; tell me what it is for?&mdash;What do they do there?

I thought, too, that the man had mentioned &s;omething of beaver, and I &s;u&s;pected that it might be the &s;ubject of their meeting. So when they came out, I acco&s;ted my merchant.&mdash;Well, Hans, (&s;ays I) I hope you have agreed to give more than 4<ABBR>s.</ABBR> a pound?" "No, (&s;ays he) I cannot give &s;o much, I cannot give more than 3<ABBR>s.</ABBR> 6<ABBR>d.</ABBR>" "I then &s;poke to &s;everal other dealers, but they all &s;ung the &s;ame &s;ong, three and &s;ix pence, three and &s;ix pence. This made it clear to me that my &s;u&s;picion was right; and that whatever they pretended of meet|ing to learn <HI>good things,</HI> the real purpo&s;e was, to con|&s;ult how to cheat Indians in the price of beaver. Con|&s;ider but a little, Conrad, and you mu&s;t be of my opin|ion. If they met &s;o often to learn <HI>good things,</HI> they certainly would have learned &s;ome before this time. But they are &s;till ignorant. You know our practice. If a white man, in travelling through our country,
<PB N="81" REF="028963_0040_0FDDBD7C177A48D0">enters one of our cabins, we all treat him as I treat you; we dry him if he is wet, we warm him if he is cold, and give him meat and drink, that he may allay his thir&s;t and hunger; and we &s;pread &s;oft furs for him to re&s;t and &s;leep on: We demand nothing in return. But if I go into a white man's hou&s;e at Albany, and a&s;k for victuals and drink, they &s;ay, where is your money? And if I have none, they &s;ay, get out, you Indian dog. You &s;ee they have not yet learned tho&s;e little <HI>good things</HI> that we need no meeting to be in&s;tructed in; becau&s;e our mothers taught them to us when we were children; and, therefore, it is impo&s;&s;ible their meetings &s;hould be, as they &s;ay, for any &s;uch purpo&s;e, or have any &s;uch effect; they are only to contrive <HI>the cheating of Indians in the price of beaver.</HI>"</P>

<P>Di&s;coveries, long ago made, inform us, that an inter|cour&s;e between the Old Continent and America might be carried on, with facility, from the north we&s;t ex|tremities of Europe and the northea&s;t boundaries of A&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. In the ninth century the Norwegians di&s;covered Green|land, and planted a colony there. The communication with that country was renewed in the la&s;t century by Moravian mi&s;&s;ionaries, in order to propagate their doc|trines in that bleak and uncultivated region. By then we are informed that the north we&s;t coa&s;t of Greenland is &s;eparated from America by a very narrow &s;trait; that at the bottom of the bay it is highly probable that they are united; that the E&s;quimaux of America perfectly re&s;emble the Greenlanders, in their a&s;pect, dre&s;s, and mode of living; and that a Moravian mi&s;&s;ionary, well acquainted with the language of Greenland, having vi&s;|ited the country of the E&s;quimaux, found, to his a&s;ton|i&s;hment, that they &s;poke the &s;ame language with the Greenlanders, and were, in every re&s;pect, the &s;ame peo|ple. The &s;ame &s;pecies of animals, too, are found in the contiguous regions.

<P>Other di&s;coveries have proved, that if the two conti|nents of A&s;ia and America be &s;eparated at all, it is on|ly by a narrow &s;trait. From this part of the Old Continent, al&s;o, inhabitants may have pa&s;&s;ed into the New; and the re&s;emblance between the Indians of A|merica and the ea&s;tern inhabitants of A&s;ia, would induce us to conjecture that they have a common origin. This is the opinion adopted by Dr. Robert&s;on, in his Hi&s;tory of America, where we find it accompanied with the following narrative.</P>

No ve&s;&s;el fitted out by the Ru&s;&s;ian court ever doubled this formidable cape; we are indebted for what is known of tho&s;e extreme regions of A&s;ia, to the di&s;coveries made in excur&s;ions by land. In all th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e provinces, an opinion prevails, that countries of great extent and fertility lie at no con&s;iderable di&s;tance from their own coa&s;ts. The&s;e the Ru&s;&s;ians imagined to be part of America; and &s;everal circum&s;tances concurred not only in confirming them in this belief, but in per|&s;uading them that &s;ome portion of that continent could not be very remote. Trees of various kinds, unknown in tho&s;e naked regions of A&s;ia, are driven upon the coa&s;t by an ea&s;terly wind. By the &s;ame wind, floating ice is brought thither in a few days; flights of birds arrive annually from the &s;ame quarter; and a tradition obtains among the inhabitants, of an intercour&s;e form|erly carried on with &s;ome countries &s;ituated to the ea&s;t.</P>
<P>"After weighing all the&s;e particulars, and compar|ing the po&s;ition of the countries in A&s;ia which they had di&s;covered, with &s;uch parts in the north we&s;t of A|merica as were already known; the Ru&s;&s;ian court form|ed a plan, which would have hardly occurred to any nation le&s;s accu&s;tomed to engage in arduous undertak|ings, and to contend with great difficulties.

Two ve&s;&s;els were fini&s;hed; and, under the command of captains Behring and T&s;chirikow, &s;ail|ed from Kamt&s;chatka in que&s;t of the New World, in a quarter where it had never been approached. They &s;haped their cour&s;e towards the ea&s;t; and though a &s;torm &s;oon &s;eparated the ve&s;&s;els, which never rejoined, and many di&s;a&s;ters befel them, the expectations from the voyage were not altogether fru&s;trated. Each of the commanders di&s;covered land, which to them appeared to be part of the American continent; and, according to their ob&s;ervations, it &s;eems to be &s;ituated within a few degrees of the north we&s;t coa&s;t of California. Each &s;et &s;ome of his people a&s;hore: but in one place the in|habitants fled as the Ru&s;&s;ians approached; in another, they carried off tho&s;e who landed, and de&s;troyed their boats. The violence of the weather, and the di&s;tre&s;s of their crews, obliged both to quit this inho&s;pitable coa&s;t. In their return they touched at &s;everal i&s;lands, which &s;tretch in a chain from ea&s;t to we&s;t between the coun|try which they had di&s;covered and the coa&s;t of A&s;ia. They had &s;ome intercour&s;e with the natives, who &s;eem|ed to them to re&s;emble the North Americans. They pre&s;ented to the Ru&s;&s;ians the calumet, or pipe of peace, which is a &s;ymbol of friend&s;hip univer&s;al among the people of North America, and an u&s;age of arbitrary in|&s;titution peculiar to them."</P>
<P>The more recent and accurate di&s;coveries of that il|lu&s;trious navigator Cooke, and of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or Clerke, have brought the matter &s;till nearer to certainty. The &s;ea, from the &s;outh of Behring's Straits to the cre&s;cent of i&s;les between A&s;ia and America, is very &s;hallow. It deepens from the&s;e &s;traits (as the Briti&s;h &s;eas do from tho&s;e of Dover) till &s;oundings are lo&s;t in the Pacific Ocean; but that does not take place but to the &s;outh of the i&s;les. Between them and the &s;traits is an in|crea&s;e

From the volcanic di&s;po&s;ition, it has been judged prob|able, not only that there was a &s;eparation of the continents at the &s;traits of Behring, but that the whole &s;pace from the i&s;les to that &s;mall opening had once been occupied by land; and that the fury of the watery element, actuated by that of fire, had, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> mo&s;t remote times, &s;ubverted and overwhelmed the tract and left the i&s;lands to &s;erve as monumental fragments.</P>
<P>Without adopting all the fancies of Buffon, there can be no doubt, as the Abb&eacute; Clavigero ob&s;erves, that our planet has been &s;ubject to great vici&s;&s;itudes &s;ince the deluge. Earthquakes have &s;wallowed &s;ome lands, and &s;ubterraneous fires have thrown up others: the rivers have formed new &s;oil with their mud: the &s;ea retreating from the &s;hores, has lengthened the land i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ome places, and advancing in others has dimini&s;hed it; it has &s;eparated &s;ome territories which were formerly united, and formed new &s;traits and gulph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. We have examples of all the&s;e revolutions in the pa&s;t century. Sicily was united to the continent of Naples, as Eubea, now the Black Sea, was to Boeotia. Diodorus, Strabo, and other ancient authors, &s;ay the &s;ame thing of Spain, and of Africa, and affirm, that by a violent eruption of the ocean upon the land between the mountains Abyla and Calpe, that communication was broken, and the Mediterranean Sea was formed. Among the people of Ceylon there is a tradition that a &s;imilar irruption of the &s;ea &s;eparated their i&s;land from the penin&s;ula of India. The &s;ame thing is believed by tho&s;e of Malabar with re&s;pect to the i&s;les of Maldivia, and with the Malayans with re&s;pect to Sumatra. It is certain, &s;ays the count de Buffon, that in Ceylon the earth has lo&s;t 30 or 40 leagues, which the &s;ea has taken from it; on the contrary, Tongres, a place of the Low Countries, has gained 30 leagues of land from the &s;ea. The northern part of Egypt owes its exi&s;t|ence
<PB N="87" REF="028963_0043_0FDDBD869105C5D8">to inundations of the Nile. The earth which this river has brought from the inland countries of Af|rica, and depo&s;ited in its inundations, has formed a &s;oil of more than 25 cubits of depth. In like manner, adds the above author, the province of the Yellow River in China, and that of Loui&s;iana, have only been formed of the mud of rivers. Plina, Seneca, Diodorus, and Strabo, report innumerable examples of &s;imilar revolutions, which we omit, that our di&s;&s;ertation may not become too prolix; as al&s;o many modern revolu|tions, which are related in the theory of the earth of the Count de Buffon and other authors. In South A|merica, all tho&s;e who have ob&s;erved with philo&s;ophic eyes the penin&s;ula of Yucatan, do not doubt that that country has once been the bed of the &s;ea; and, on the contrary, in the channel of Bahama, many indications &s;how the i&s;land of Cuba to have been once united to the continent of Florida. In the &s;trait which &s;eparates America from A&s;ia many i&s;lands are found, which pro|bably were the mountains belonging to that tract of land which we &s;uppo&s;e to have been &s;wallowed up by earthquakes; which is made more probable by the multitude of volcanoes which we know of in the penin|&s;ula of Kamt&s;chatka. It is imagined, however, that the &s;inking of that land, and the &s;eparation of the two continents, has been occa&s;ioned by tho&s;e great and ex|traordinary earthquakes mentioned in the hi&s;tories of the Americans, which formed an aera almo&s;t as memor|able as that of the deluge. The hi&s;tories of the Tolte|cas fix &s;uch earthquakes in the year I Te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; but as we know not to what century that belonged, we can form no conjecture of the time that great calamity hap|pened. If a great earthquake &s;hould overwhelm the i&s;th|mus of Suez, and there &s;hould be at the &s;ame time as great a &s;carcity of hi&s;torians as there were in the fir&s;t ages after the deluge, it would be doubted, in 300 or 400 years after, whether A&s;ia had ever been united by that part to Africa; and many would firmly deny it.</P>

Whether that great event, the &s;eparation of the continents, took place before or after the population of America, it is impo&s;&s;ible for us to determine: but we are indebted to the abovementioned navigators for &s;ettling the long di&s;pute about the point from which it was effected. Their ob&s;ervations prove, that in one place the di&s;tance between continent and continent is only 39 miles, not (as the author of the <HI>Reckerch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Philo&s;ophiques &s;ur les Americains</HI> would have it) 800 leagues.

<P>"The cu&s;tom of &s;calping was a barbari&s;m in u&s;e with the Scythians, who carried about them, at all times; this &s;avage mark of triumph; they cut a circle round the neck, and &s;tripped off the &s;kin, as they would that of an ox.

This u&s;age, as we well know, by horrid experience, is continued to this day in America. The ferocity of the Scyth|ians to their pri&s;oners extended to the remote&s;t part of A&s;ia. The Kamt&s;chatkans, even at the time of their di&s;covery by the Ru&s;&s;ians, put their pri&s;oners to death by the mo&s;t lingering and excruciating inven|tions; a practice in full force to this very day among the aboriginal Americans.

<P>The continent which &s;tocked America with the hu|man race, is &s;uppo&s;ed, by Mr. Pennant, to have pour|ed in the brute creation, through the &s;ame pa&s;&s;age.

Seventeen of the Kamt&s;chatkan quadrupeds are found in America: Others are common only to Siberia, or Tar|tary, having, for unknown cau&s;es, entirely evacuated Kamt&s;chatka, and divided them&s;elves between Ameri|ca and the parts of A&s;ia above cited.

After the&s;e wondrous proofs of omnipotency, it will be ab&s;urd to deny the po&s;&s;ibility of infu&s;ing in&s;tinct into the brute creation. "God him&s;elf is the &s;oul of brutes;" his plea&s;ure mu&s;t have determined their will, and directed &s;everal &s;pecies, and even whole genera, by impul&s;e irre|&s;i&s;tible, to move by &s;low progre&s;&s;ion to their de&s;tined regions. But for that, the illama and the pacos might &s;till have inhabited the heights of Armenia, and &s;ome more neighbouring Alps, in&s;tead of labouring to gain the di&s;tant Peruvian Andes; the whole genus of armadillos, flow of foot, would never have quitted the torrid zone of the Old World for that of the New; and the whole tribe of monkeys would have gamboled together in the fore&s;ts of India, in&s;tead of dividing their re&s;idence between the &s;hades of Indo&s;tan, and the deep fore&s;ts of the Bra&s;ils. Lions and tigers might

The Old World would have been over&s;tocked with animals; the New remained an unanimated wa&s;te! Or both have contain|ed an equal portion of every bea&s;t of the earth. Let it not be objected, that animals bred in a &s;outhern climate, after the de&s;cent of their parents from the ark, would be unable to bear the fro&s;t and &s;now of the rig|orous north, before they reached South America, the place of their final de&s;tination. It mu&s;t be con&s;idered, that the migration mu&s;t have been the work of ages; that in the cour&s;e of their progre&s;s each generation grew hardened to the climate it had reached; and that, after their arrival in America, they would again be gradually accu&s;tomed to warmer and warmer climates, in their removal from north to &s;outh, as they had in the rever&s;e, or from &s;outh to north. Part of the tiger, &s;till inhabit the eternal &s;nows of Ararat, and multitudes of the very &s;ame &s;pecies live, but with exalted rage, beneath the line, in the burning &s;oil of Borneo, or Sumatra; but neither lions or tigers ever migrated into the New World.

<P>In fine, the conjectures of the learned re&s;pecting the vicinity of the Old and New World are now, by the di&s;coveries of late great navigators, lo&s;t in conviction; and, in the place of imaginary hypothe&s;is, the real place of migration almo&s;t incontrovertibly pointed out.

A mighty &s;ea aro&s;e, and, in one day and night, engulphed this &s;tu|pendous tract, and with it every being which had not completed its migration into America. The whole ne|gro race, and almo&s;t every quadruped, now inhabi|tants of Africa, peri&s;hed in this critical day. Five only are to be found, at pre&s;ent, in America; and of the&s;e only one, the bear, in South America: Not a &s;ingle cu&s;tom, common to the natives of Africa and America, to evince a common origin. Of the quadrupeds, the bear, &s;tag, wolf, fox, and wee&s;el, are the only ani|mals which we can pronounce, with certainty, to be found on each continent. The &s;tag, the fox, and the wee&s;el, have made, al&s;o, no farther progre&s;s in Africa than the north; but on the &s;ame continent the wolf is &s;pread over every part, yet is unknown in South Amer|ica, as are the fox and wee&s;el. In Africa and in South America the bear is very local, being met with only in the north of the fir&s;t, and on the Andes in the la&s;t. Some cau&s;e unknown arre&s;ted its progre&s;s in Africa, and impelled the migration of a few into the Chilian Alps, and induced them to leave unoccupied the va&s;t tract from North America to the lofty Cordilleras.</P>

<P>Remains of Antiquity in America.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>ALLUSIONS have often been made by travellers, and others, to &s;ome remains in America which ap|peared to owe their original to a people more intimately acquainted with the arts of life than the <HI>&s;avage</HI> tribes which inhabited this continent on its fir&s;t di&s;covery by the Europeans, or than tho&s;e which are, at pre&s;ent, &s;cat|tered through various parts of its extent. In a &s;mall work, publi&s;hed in London, in 1787, entitled <HI>Ob&s;erva|tions on &s;ome parts of natural hi&s;tory<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">: To which is prefixed, an account of &s;everal remarkable ve&s;tiges of an ancient date, which have been di&s;covered in different parts of America,</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By Dr. <HI>Benjamin Smith Barton,</HI> of Philadelphia.</NOTE> Part I. the author has collected the &s;catter|ed hints of Kaim, of Carver, of Fil&s;on, and &s;ome other travellers, and writers; and has added a plan and de&s;cription of a regular work, which he &s;uppo&s;es to have been a <HI>fortification,</HI> that has been di&s;covered near the confluence of the rivers Ohio and Mu&s;kingum. The remains de&s;cribed, or alluded to, in this publication, are characters, or &s;ingular marks, which were &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome Je&s;uits, who examined them, to be <HI>Tartarian;</HI> furrows, as if the land had been ploughed; a &s;tone wall; mounds of earth, of different forms and &s;izes; earthen walls, and ditches, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The mounds of earth are &s;uppo&s;ed, by the author, to have been de&s;igned for different purpo&s;es: The <HI>&s;maller</HI> ones are, evidently, tumuli, or repo&s;itories of the dead; and, he thinks, the larger ones, as that at Grave Creek (a branch of the Ohio) many which are to be &s;een in Mexico, and in other parts of America, were intended to &s;erve as the ba&s;es of temples.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t curious part of this little work is the de|&s;cription, together with the plan, of the &s;uppo&s;ed for|tification,
<PB N="97" REF="028963_0048_0FDDBD920F627230">above alluded to. It is &s;ituated on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the river Mu&s;kingum, about half a mile above it junction with the river Ohio, nearly in the latitude of 39&deg;. 21&prime;. and about 170 miles below Fort Pitt, at the confluence of the rivers Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eghaney and Monongahe|la. The town, as it has been, &s;ometimes, called, is a large level, encompa&s;&s;ed by walls of a tetragon form; occupying a piece of ground about one quarter of a mile &s;quare. The&s;e walls are from &s;ix to ten feet in height, and from twenty to forty feet in thickne&s;s. They are, at pre&s;ent, overgrown with vegetables, of different kinds, and, among others, with trees, &s;ome of which are of a very con&s;iderable diameter. Each &s;ide of the walls is divided, by three cha&s;ms, or openings, into four, nearly equal, parts: The&s;e cha&s;ms are directly oppo&s;ite to each other. Within the walls there are three elevations; the large&s;t of the&s;e is of an oblong form, 74 yards long, 44 yards broad, and 6 feet in height: The &s;econd is nearly of a &s;imilar form, 50 yards long, and 40 broad: The third is, al&s;o, an oblong mount, but much &s;maller. Be&s;ides the&s;e three eleva|tions, there is a &s;mall circular mount, placed nearly in the centre of four &s;mall caves; and a "&s;omi circular parapet," which, it is not improbable, may have been de|&s;igned to guard one of the cha&s;ms, or openings: This parapet has a &s;mall mount. The author ob&s;erves, that the three elevations "con&s;iderably re&s;emble &s;ome of the eminences which have been di&s;covered near the river Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi," of which he has given an account in his publication.</P>
<P>The fortifications (for a di&s;tinction has been made between them and the town, but we cannot &s;ee with what great propriety) are nearly of the &s;ame form as the town. The walls have here, al&s;o, openings: And at each of the&s;e openings there is one, or more, of the &s;mall circular mounts.</P>
<P>The pyramid is one of the mo&s;t con&s;picuous parts of the&s;e &s;ingular remains. It is of a circular form; 50
<PB N="98" REF="028963_0049_0FDDBD93890B8188">feet in height, 390 feet in circumferance; and is &s;ur|rounded with a ditch, 5 feet deep, and 15 feet wide: Externally to the ditch there is a parapet, which is 759 feet in circumference. "The pyramid, as well as the eminences and walls, is now covered with gra&s;&s;es, and other kinds of vegetables." Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are &s;everal other eminences, of which we do not think it nece&s;&s;ary to take any notice, in this place.</P>
<P>The author's opinion concerning the&s;e remains is this; that they owe their original to "the Toltecas, or &s;ome other Mexican nation," and that the&s;e people were, probably, the de&s;cendants of the Danes. The fir&s;t member of this <HI>conjecture</HI> appears not improbable, if we con&s;ider the &s;imilarity of the Mexican mounts and fortifications, de&s;cribed by Torquemada, by the Abb&eacute; Clavegero, and by other authors, to tho&s;e of which our author has publi&s;hed an account; and, al&s;o, if we con|&s;ider the tradition of the Mexicans, that they came from the north we&s;t, in which tract great numbers of the&s;e remains have been di&s;covered. As to the &s;econd mem|ber of this conjecture, we think it but feebly &s;upported; although we are not ignorant that Grotius and other writers have endeavoured to prove, that the northern nations of Europe, had, actually, &s;ome intercour&s;e with America, long before the time of Columbus.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, there are in&s;criptions in &s;trange characters in different parts of the we&s;tern country: One, in particular, on a flat rock on the river Cumberland, the exi&s;tence of which general Clarke affirms. It is &s;aid to be lengthy, and would no doubt if decyphered throw great light upon the ancient hi&s;tory of America.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Ancients &s;uppo&s;ed to have had &s;ome imperfect Notion of a New World&mdash;Preten&s;ions of the Wel&s;h to the Di&s;covery of America&mdash;Tho&s;e of the Norwegians better founded.&mdash;Projects of CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS&mdash; his Voyage&mdash;A&s;toni&s;hment occa&s;ioned by ob&s;erving the Variation of the Compa&s;s&mdash;his perilous Situation&mdash;his Crew ready to mutiny&mdash;their Joy on d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;erying Land&mdash; they land on one of the I&s;lands of the New World&mdash;The Continent afterwards di&s;covered&mdash;The New World de|rives its name from AMERICUS VES<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">S&mdash;Divi&s;|ions of America&mdash;Its productions&mdash;Its different Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT is believed, by many, that the ancients had &s;ome im|perfect notion of the New World; and &s;everal an|cient authors are quoted in confirmation of this opinion. In a book, a&s;cribed to the philo&s;opher Ari&s;totle, we are told that the Carthaginians di&s;covered an i&s;land, far be|yond the pillars of Hercules, large, fertile, and finely watered, with navigable rivers, but uninhabited. This i&s;land was di&s;tant a few days &s;ailing from the continent: its beauty induced the di&s;coverers to &s;ettle there; but the policy of Carthage di&s;lodged the colony, and laid &s;trict prohibition on all the &s;ubjects of the &s;tate not to at|tempt any future e&s;tabli&s;hment. This account is al&s;o confirmed by an hi&s;torian of no mean credit, who re|lates, that the Tyrians would have &s;ettled a colony on the newly di&s;covered i&s;land, but were oppo&s;ed by the Carthaginians, for &s;tate rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>The Wel&s;h, fondly, imagine that their country con|tributed, in 1170, to people the New World, by the adventure of Madoc, &s;on of Owen Gwynedd, who, on the death of his father, &s;ailed there, and colonized part of the country. It is pretended that Mado<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> made two voyages: That &s;ailing we&s;t, he left Ireland &s;o far to
<PB N="100" REF="028963_0050_0FDDBD951E29F068">the north, that he came to land unknown, where he &s;aw many &s;trange things; that he returned home, and, making a report of the fertility of the newly di&s;covered country, prevailed on numbers of the Wel&s;h, of each &s;ex, to accompany him, on a &s;econd voyage, from which he never returned. The favourers of this opinion a&s;|&s;ert, that &s;everal Wel&s;h words, &s;uch as <HI>gwrando,</HI> "to hearken, or li&s;ten;" the i&s;le of <HI>Croe&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> or "welcome;" <HI>Cape Breton,</HI> from the name of the Briti&s;h i&s;land; <HI>gwynndwr,</HI> or "the white water;" and <HI>pingwin,</HI> or "the bird with a white head;" are to be found in the American language. But likene&s;s of &s;ound, in a few words, will not be deemed &s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h the fact; e&s;pecially if the meaning has been evidently pervert|ed: For example, the whole pinguin tribe have, unfor|tunately, not only black <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ds, but are not inhabitants of the northern hemi&s;phere; the name was al&s;o be&s;tow|ed on them by the Dutch <HI>a pinguedine,</HI> from their ex|ce&s;&s;ive fatne&s;s. It may be added, that the Wel&s;h were never a naval people; that the age in which Mado<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> liv|ed was peculiarly ignorant in navigation; and the mo&s;t which they could have attempted mu&s;t have been a mere coa&s;ting voyage.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The different opinions upon this &s;ubject, and the foundations upon which they are built, are to be found in Dr. Robert&s;on's Hi&s;|tory of America; Dr. Belknap's American Biography, Vol. I. and Dr. John Williams's inquiry concerning the fir&s;t di&s;covery of Ameri|ca. Curious extracts, from the latter, are in the American Mu&s;eum, Vol. XI. p. 152 and 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">9.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Norwegians put in for a &s;hare of the glory, on grounds rather better than the Wel&s;h. By their &s;ettle|ments in Iceland, and in Greenland, they had arrived within &s;o &s;mall a di&s;tance of the New World, that there is a probability of its having been touched at by a people &s;o ver&s;ed in maritime affairs, and &s;o adventurous, as the ancient Normans were. The proofs are much more numerous than tho&s;e produced by the Briti&s;h hi&s;torians; for the di&s;covery is mentioned in &s;everal of the Iceland|i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> manu&s;cripts. The period was about the year 1002,
<PB N="101" REF="028963_0050_0FDDBD951E29F068">when it was vi&s;ited by one Biorn; and the di&s;covery pur&s;ued to great effect by Leif, the &s;on of Eric, the di&s;|coverer of Greenland. It does not appear that they reached farther than Labrador; on which coa&s;t they met with the E&s;quimaux, on whom they be&s;towed the name of <HI>Skraelingues,</HI> or dwarfi&s;h people, from their &s;mall &s;tature. They were armed with bows and arrows, and had leathern canoes, &s;uch as they have at pre&s;ent. All this is probable; nor &s;hould the tale of the German, called <HI>Turkil,</HI> one of the crew, invalidate the account. He was one day mi&s;&s;ing; but &s;oon returned, leaping and &s;inging, with all the extravagant marks of joy a <HI>bon vivant</HI> could &s;how, on di&s;covering the inebriating fruit of his country, the grape: Tor&s;aeus even &s;ays, that he returned in a &s;tate of intoxication. To con|vince his commander, he brought &s;everal bunches: And the country, from that circum&s;tance, was named <HI>Vin|land.</HI> There appears no rea&s;on to doubt of the di&s;|covery; it is thought probable, however, that the&s;e people reached no farther than the barren country of Labrador. In &s;hort, it is from a much later period, that we mu&s;t date the <HI>unequivocal</HI> di&s;covery of America.</P>
<P>TOWARDS the clo&s;e of the 15th century, Venice and Genoa being rivals in commerce, in which the former had greatly the &s;uperiority, Chri&s;topher Colon, or Colum|bus, a native of Genoa, conceived a project of &s;ailing to the Ea&s;t Indies by directing his cour&s;e we&s;tward. This de&s;ign was founded upon a mi&s;take of the geographers, of tho&s;e days, who placed the ea&s;tern parts of A&s;ia im|men&s;ely too far to the ea&s;tward; &s;o that had they been in the right, the &s;horte&s;t way would have been to &s;ail directly we&s;tward. Columbus applied, fir&s;t, to his own countrymen; but being rejected by them, he applied to Portugal, where he met with no better &s;ucce&s;s. Spain was his next re&s;ource: here, after eight years attendance, he obtained, in 1492, a fleet of three &s;hips. The large&s;t, a &s;hip of no con&s;iderable burden, was com|manded
<PB N="102" REF="028963_0051_0FDDBD96A9581B40">by Columbus, as admiral, who gave it the name of <HI>Santa Maria,</HI> out of re&s;pect for the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, whom he honoured with &s;ingular devotion. Of the &s;e|cond, called the <HI>Pinta,</HI> Martin Pinzon was captain, and his brother Francis pilot. The third, named the <HI>Nigna,</HI> was under the command of Vincent Yanez Pinzon. The&s;e two were light ve&s;&s;els, hardly &s;uperior in bur|den, or force, to large boats. This &s;quadron, if it merits that name, was victualled for 12 months, and had on board 90 men, mo&s;tly &s;ailors, together with a few ad|venturers, who followed the fortune of Columbus, and &s;ome gentlemen of I&s;abella's court, whom &s;he appointed to accompany him. Though the expen&s;e of the undertak|ing was one of the circum&s;tances which chiefly alarmed the court of Spain, and retarded, &s;o long, the negoci|ation with Columbus, the &s;um employed in fitting out this &s;quadron did not exceed 4000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> As Columbus was deeply impre&s;&s;ed with &s;entiments of religion, he would not &s;et out upon an expedition &s;o arduous, and of which one great object was to extend the knowledge of the chri&s;tian faith, without imploring publicly, the guid|ance and protection of Heaven. With this view, he, together with all the per&s;ons under his command, marched, in &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ion, to the mona&s;tery of Ra|bida. After confe&s;&s;ing their &s;ins, and obtaining ab|&s;olution, they received the holy &s;acrament from the hands of the guardian, who joined his prayers to theirs for the &s;ucce&s;s of an enterprize which he had &s;o zealou&s;ly patronized.</P>
<P>Next morning, being Friday, the third day of Au|gu&s;t, in the year 1492, Columbus &s;et &s;ail, a little be|fore &s;un ri&s;e, in pre&s;ence of a va&s;t crowd of &s;pectators, who &s;ent up their &s;upplications to Heaven for the pro&s;|perous i&s;&s;ue of the voyage, which they wi&s;hed, rather than expected. Columbus &s;teered, directly, for the Can|ary I&s;lands, and arrived there without any occurrence that would have de&s;erved notice on any other occa&s;ion: but, in a voyage of &s;uch expectation and importance,
<PB N="103" REF="028963_0051_0FDDBD96A9581B40">every circum&s;tance was the object of attention. The rudder of the Pinta broke loo&s;e, the day after &s;he le&s;t the harbour, and that accident alarmed the crew, no le&s;s &s;uper&s;titious than un&s;kilful, as a certain omen of the unfortunate de&s;tiny of the expedition. Even in the &s;hort run to the Canaries, the &s;hips were found to be &s;o crazy, and ill appointed, as to be very improper for a navigation which was expected to be both long and dangerous. Columbus refitted them, however, to the be&s;t of his power; and having &s;upplied him&s;elf with fre&s;h provi&s;ions, he took his departure from Gomera, one of the mo&s;t we&s;terly of the Canary I&s;lands, on the &s;ixth day of September.</P>
<P>Here the voyage of di&s;covery may properly be &s;aid to begin; for Columbus, holding his cour&s;e due we&s;t, left, immediately, the u&s;ual track of navigation, and &s;tretched into unfrequented and unknown &s;eas. The fir&s;t day, as it was very calm, he made but little way; but on the &s;econd he lo&s;t &s;ight of the Canaries; and many of the &s;ailors, already dejected and di&s;mayed, when they contemplated the boldne&s;s of the undertak|ing, began to beat their brea&s;ts, and to &s;hed tears, as if they were never more to behold land. Columbus comforted them with a&s;&s;urances of &s;ucce&s;s, and the pro&s;pect of va&s;t wealth, in tho&s;e opulent regions whith|er he was conducting them. He regulated every thing by his &s;ole authority; he &s;uperintended the exe|cution of every order; and allowed him&s;elf only a few hours for &s;leep; he was at all other times upon deck. As his cour&s;e lay through &s;eas which had not, formerly, been vi&s;ited, the &s;ounding line, or in&s;truments for ob|&s;ervation, were continually in his hands. After the example of the Portugue&s;e di&s;coverers, he attended to the motion of tides and currents, watched the flight of birds, the appearance of fi&s;hes, of &s;ea weeds, and of every thing that floated on the waves, and entered eve|ry occurrence with a minute exactne&s;s, in the journal which he kept. As the length of the voyage could not
<PB N="104" REF="028963_0052_0FDDBDF775555DB8">fail of alarming &s;ailors habituated only to &s;hort <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ions, Columbus endeavoured to conceal from them the real progre&s;s which they made. With this view, though they ran 18 leagues the &s;econd day, after they left Gomera, he gave out that they had advanced only 15, and he uniformly employed the &s;ame artifice of reckoning &s;hort, during the whole voyage. By the 14th of September, the fleet was above 200 leagues to the we&s;t of the Canary I&s;les. There they were &s;truck with an appearance, no le&s;s a&s;toni&s;hing than new. They ob&s;erved that the magnetic needle, in their com|pa&s;&s;es, did not point exactly to the polar &s;tar, but varie&s;t towards the we&s;t; and, as they proceeded, this vari|ation increa&s;ed. This appearance, which is now familiar, though it &s;till remains one of the my&s;teries of nature, into the cau&s;e of which the &s;agacity of man hath not been able to penetrate, &s;illed the companions of Columbus with terror. They were now in a bound|le&s;s, unknown, ocean, far from the u&s;ual place of navi|gation; nature it&s;elf &s;eemed to be altered, and the only guide which they had left was about to fail them. Co|lumbus, with no le&s;s quickne&s;s than ingenuity, invent|ed a rea&s;on for this appearance, which, though it did not &s;atisfy him&s;elf, &s;eemed &s;o plau&s;ible to them, that it di&s;pelled their fears, or &s;ilenced their murmurs.</P>
<P>He &s;till continued to &s;teer due we&s;t, nearly in the &s;ame latitude with the Canary I&s;lands. In this cour&s;e, he came within the &s;phere of the trade wind, which blows, invariably, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, between the tropics, and a few degrees beyond them. He advanced before this &s;teady gale with &s;uch uniform rapidity, that it was &s;eldom nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hift a &s;ail. When about 400 leagues to the we&s;t of the Canaries, he found the &s;ea &s;o covered with weeds, that it re&s;embled a meadow of va&s;t extent; and in &s;ome places they were &s;o thick, as to retard the motion of the ve&s;&s;els. This &s;trange appearance occa|&s;ioned new alarm and di&s;quiet. The &s;ailors imagined that they were now arrived at the utmo&s;t boundary of
<PB N="105" REF="028963_0052_0FDDBDF775555DB8">the navigable o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n; that the&s;e floating weeds would ob&s;truct their &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ther progre&s;s, and concealed dangerous rocks, or &s;ome large tract of land, which had &s;unk, they knew not how, in that place. Columbus en|deavoured to per&s;uade them, that what had alarmed, ought rather to have encouraged them, and was to be con&s;idered as a &s;ign of approaching land. At the &s;ame time, a bri&s;k gale aro&s;e, and carried them forward. Several birds were &s;een hovering about the &s;hip, and directed their &s;light towards the we&s;t. The de&s;pond|ing crew re&s;umed &s;ome degree of &s;pirit, and began to entertain fre&s;h hopes.</P>
<P>Upon the fir&s;t of October they were, according to the admiral's reckoning, 770 leagues to the we&s;t of the Canaries; but, le&s;t his men &s;hould be intimidated by the prodigious length of the navigation, he gave out that they had proceeded only 584 leagues; and fortun|ately for Columbus, neither his own pilot, nor tho&s;e of the other &s;hips, had &s;kill &s;ufficient to correct this error, and to di&s;cover the deceit. They had, now, been above three weeks at &s;ea: they had proceeded far be|yond what former navigators had attempted, or deemed po&s;&s;ible: all their progno&s;tics of di&s;covery, drawn from the flight of birds, and other circum&s;tances, had prov|ed fallacious: the appearances of land, with which their own credulity, or the artifice of their commander, had, from time to time, flattered and amu&s;ed them, had been altogether illu&s;ive, and their pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s &s;eemed now to be as di&s;tant as ever. The&s;e reflections occur|red often to men, who had no other object, or occupa|tion, than to rea&s;on and to di&s;cour&s;e concerning the in|tention and circum&s;tances of their expedition. They made impre&s;&s;ion, at fir&s;t, upon the ignorant and timid, and extending, by degrees, to &s;uch as were better in|formed, or more re&s;olute, the contagion &s;pread, at length, from &s;hip to &s;hip.

<P>Columbus was fully &s;en&s;ible of his perilous &s;ituation. He had ob&s;erved, with great unea&s;ine&s;s, the fatal oper|ation of ignorance, and of fear, in producing di&s;affec|tion among his crew; and &s;aw that it was now ready to bur&s;t out into open mutiny.

Notwith&s;tanding the agi|tation and &s;olicitude of his own mind, he appeared with a cheerful countenance; like a man &s;atisfied with the progre&s;s which he had made, and confident of &s;uc|ce&s;s. Sometimes he employed all the arts of in&s;inua|tion to &s;oothe his men. Sometimes he endeavoured to work upon their ambition, or avarice, by magnificent de&s;criptions of the fame and wealth which they were about to acquire. On other occa&s;ions he a&s;&s;umed a tone of authority, and threatened them with vengeance

<P>As they proceeded, the indications of approaching land &s;eemed to be more certain, and excited hope in proportion. The birds began to appear in flocks, mak|ing towards the &s;outh we&s;t. Columbus, in imitation of the Portugue&s;e navigators, who had been guided in &s;everal of their di&s;coveries by the motion of birds, al|tered his cour&s;e from due we&s;t towards that quarter whither they pointed their flight. But after holding on for &s;everal days in this new direction without any better &s;ucce&s;s than formerly, having &s;een no object during 30 days but the &s;ea and the &s;ky, the hopes of his companions &s;ub&s;ided fa&s;ter than they had ri&s;en; their fears revived with additional force; impatience, rage, and de&s;pair, appeared in every countenance. All &s;en&s;e of &s;ubordination was lo&s;t. The officers, who had hitherto concurred with Columbus in opinion, and &s;up|ported his authority, now took part with the private men: they a&s;&s;embled tumultuou&s;ly, on the deck, ex|po&s;tulated with their commander, mingled threats with their expo&s;tulations, and required him in&s;tantly to tack about, and to return to Europe. Columbus perceived that it would be of no avail to have recour&s;e to any of his former arts, which having been tried &s;o often had lo&s;t their effect; and that it was impo&s;&s;ible to rekindle any zeal for the &s;ucce&s;s of the expedition among men in who&s;e brea&s;ts fear had extingui&s;hed every generous &s;entiment. He &s;aw that it was no le&s;s vain to think of employing either gentle or &s;evere mea&s;ures, to quell a mutiny &s;o general and &s;o violent. It was nece&s;&s;ary,
<PB N="108" REF="028963_0054_0FDDBD998347C090">on all the&s;e accounts, to &s;oothe pa&s;&s;ions which he could no longer command, and to give way to a torrent too impetuous to be checked. He promi&s;ed, &s;olemnly, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> his men, that he would comply with their reque&s;t, pro|vided they would accompany him, and obey his com|mands for three days longer; and if, during that time, land were not di&s;covered, he would then abandon the enterprize and direct his cour&s;e towards Spain.</P>
<P>Enraged as the &s;ailors were, and impatient to turn their faces again towards their native country, this propo&s;ition did not appear to them unrea&s;onable. Not did Columbus hazard much in confining him&s;elf to a term &s;o &s;hort. The pre&s;ages of di&s;covering land went now &s;o numerous and promi&s;ing, that he deemed the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> infallible. For &s;ome days, the &s;ounding line had reach|ed the bottom, and the &s;oil which it brought up indicated land to be at no great di&s;tance. The flocks of birds increa&s;ed; and were compo&s;ed not only of &s;ea fowl, but of &s;uch land birds as could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to fly far from the &s;hore. The crew of the Pinta ob&s;erved a cane floating, which &s;eemed to be newly cut, and like|wi&s;e a piece of timber artificially carved. The &s;ailors aboard the Nigna took up the branch of a tree, with red berries, perfectly fre&s;h. The clouds around the &s;etting &s;un a&s;&s;umed a new appearance; the air was more mild and warm; and, during night, the wind became unequal and variable. From all the&s;e &s;ymp|toms, Columbus was &s;o confident of being near land, that on the evening of the 11th of October, 1492, after public prayers for &s;ucce&s;s, he ordered the &s;ails to be furled and the &s;hips to lie by, keeping &s;trict watch, le&s;t they &s;hould be driven a&s;hore in the night. During this interval of &s;u&s;pen&s;e and expectation, no man &s;hut his eyes, all kept upon deck, gazing intently towards that quarter where they expected to di&s;cover the land which had been &s;o long the object of their wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>About two hours before midnight, Columbus &s;tand|ing on the foreca&s;tle, ob&s;erved a light at a di&s;tance,
<PB N="109" REF="028963_0054_0FDDBD998347C090">and privately pointed it out to Pedro Guttierez, a page of the queen's wardrobe. Guttierez perceived it; and calling to Salcedo, comptroller of the fleet, all three &s;aw it in motion, as if it were carried from place to place. A little after midnight, the joyful &s;ound of <HI>land! land!</HI> was heard from the Pinta, which kept always ahead of the other &s;hips. But having been &s;o often deceived by fallacious appearances, every man was now become &s;low of belief; and waited, in all the angui&s;h of uncertainty and impatience, for the return of day. As &s;oon as morning dawned, all doubts and fears were di&s;pelled. From each &s;hip, an i&s;land was &s;een about two leagues to the north, who&s;e flat and verdant fields, well &s;tored with wood, and watered with many rivulets, pre&s;ented the a&s;pect of a delightful country. The crew of the Pinta in&s;tantly began the <HI>Te Deum,</HI> as a hymn of thank&s;giving to God; and were joined by tho&s;e of the other &s;hips, with tears of joy and tran&s;ports of congratulation. This office of gratitude to Heaven was followed by an act of ju&s;tice to their commander. They threw them&s;elves at the feet of Columbus, with feelings of &s;elf condemnation ming|led with reverence. They implored him to pardon their ignorance, incredulity, and in&s;olence, which had created him &s;o much unnece&s;&s;ary di&s;quiet, and had &s;o often ob&s;tructed the pro&s;ecution of his well concerted plan; and pa&s;&s;ing, in the warmth of their admiration, from one extreme to another, they now pronounced the man whom they had &s;o lately reviled, and threatened, to be a per&s;on in&s;pired by Heaven, with &s;agacity and fortitude more than human, in order to accompli&s;h a de&s;ign &s;o far beyond the ideas and conception of all former ages.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the &s;un aro&s;e, all their boats were man|ned and armed. They rowed towards the i&s;land with their colours di&s;played, with warlike mu&s;ic, and other martial pomp. As they approached the coa&s;t, they &s;aw it covered with a multitude of people, whom the novelty of the &s;pectacle had drawn together, who&s;e

Columbus was the fir&s;t European who &s;et foot in the New World, which he had di&s;covered. He landed in a rich dre&s;s, and with a naked &s;word in his hand. His men followed; and, kneeling down, they all ki&s;&s;ed the ground which they had &s;o long de|&s;ired to &s;ee. They, next, erected a crucifix; and, pro&s;|trating them&s;elves before it, returned thanks to God for conducting their voyage to &s;uch an happy i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>The above was one of the Bahama I&s;lands; to which he gave the name of <HI>San Salvador,</HI> and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it in the name of their Catholic maje&s;ties. In this fir&s;t voyage he di&s;covered &s;everal other of the Lucavo, or Bahama I&s;lands, with tho&s;e of Cuba and Hi&s;paniola. The natives con&s;idered the Spaniards as divinities, and the di&s;charge of the artillery as their thunder: they fell pro&s;trate at the &s;ound. The women, however, offered their favours, and courted the embraces of their new gue&s;ts as men. Their hu&s;bands were not jealous of them; and in the arms of tho&s;e wantons the companions of Columbus are &s;aid, by &s;ome authors, to have caught that malady which directs its poi&s;on to the &s;prings of life. The Abb&eacute; Raynal is of opinion that this di&s;order was known in Europe before the di&s;covery of America.

<P>Di&s;covery of North America, and the Attempts made to form Settlements in it, till King James I. e&s;tabli&s;hed the London and Plymouth Companies.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>NORTH AMERICA was di&s;covered in the reign of Henry VII. a period when the arts and &s;cien|cies had made very con&s;iderable progre&s;s in Europe. Many of the fir&s;t adventurers were men of genius and learning, and were careful to pre&s;erve authentic records of &s;uch of their proceedings as would be intere&s;ting to po&s;terity. The&s;e records afford ample documents for American hi&s;torians. Perhaps no people on the globe, can trace the hi&s;tory of their origin and progre&s;s with &s;o much preci&s;ion, as the inhabitants of North Ameri|ca; particularly that part of them who inhabit the ter|ritory of the United States.</P>
<P>The fame which Columbus had acquired by his fir&s;t di&s;coveries on this we&s;tern continent, &s;pread through Europe,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1495.</NOTE> and in&s;pired many with the &s;pirit of enterprize. As early as 1495, four years only after the fir&s;t di&s;covery of America, John Cabot, a Venetian, obtained a grant or commi&s;&s;ion from Henry VII. to di&s;cover unknown lands and annex them to the crown.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Hazard's "Hi&s;torical Collections," page 9, Vol. I, where this grant is recited at large. It is dated A. D. 1495.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the &s;pring of 1496 he &s;ailed from England with two &s;hips, carrying with him his three &s;ons. In this voyage, which was intended for China, he fell in with the north &s;ide of Terra Labrador, and coa&s;ted northerly as far as the 67th degree of latitude.
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Smith, in his Hi&s;tory of New York, &s;ays, his di&s;coveries of the continent reached "from the 38th to the 68th degree of north lati|tude."</NOTE></P>
<P>1497.] The next year he made a &s;econd voyage to America with his &s;on Seba&s;tian, who afterwards pro|ceeded
<PB N="115" REF="028963_0057_0FDDBD9DE02B5DE8">in the di&s;coveries which his father had begun. On the 24th of June he di&s;covered Bonnavi&s;ta, on the north ea&s;t &s;ide of Newfoundland. Before his return he traver&s;ed the coa&s;t from Davis's &s;traits to Cape Florida.</P>
<P>1502.] Seba&s;tian Cabot was this year at Newfound|land; and on his return, carried three of the natives of that i&s;land to King Henry VII.</P>
<P>1513.] In the &s;pring of 1513, John Ponce &s;ailed from Porto Rico northerly, and di&s;covered the conti|nent in 30&deg; 8&prime; north latitude. He landed in April, a &s;ea&s;on when the country around was covered with ver|dure, and in full bloom. This circum&s;tance induced him to call the country Florida, which, for many years, was the common name for North and South America.</P>
<P>1516.] In 1516, Sir Seba&s;tian Cabot and Sir Thomas Pert, explored the coa&s;t as far as Brazil in South Amer|ica.</P>
<P>This va&s;t extent of country, the coa&s;t of which was thus explored, remained unclaimed and un&s;ettled by any European power, (except by the Spaniards in South America) for almo&s;t a century from the time of its di&s;|covery.</P>
<P>1524.] It was not till the year 1524 that France at|tempted di&s;coveries on the American coa&s;t. Stimulated by his enterprizing neighbours, Francis I. who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a great and active mind, &s;ent John Verrazano, a Flor|entine, to America, for the purpo&s;e of making di&s;cove|ries. He traver&s;ed the coa&s;t from latitude 28&deg; to 50&deg; north. In a &s;econd voyage, &s;ometime after, he was lo&s;t.</P>
<P>1525.] The next year Stephen Gomez, the fir&s;t Spaniard who came upon the American coa&s;t for di&s;|covery, &s;ailed from Groyn in Spain, to Cuba and Flor|ida, thence northward to Cape Razo, in latitude 46&deg; north, in &s;earch of a northern pa&s;&s;age to the Ea&s;t Indies.</P>

1534.] In the &s;pring of 1534, by the direction of Francis I. a fleet was fitted out at St. Malo's in France, with de&s;ign to make di&s;coveries in America. The command of this fleet was given to James Cartier.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Hazard's Hi&s;torical Collection, Vol. I, page 19, is a commi&s;|&s;ion from Francis I. to James Cartier or Quartier, for making an e&s;tab|li&s;hment in Canada, dated Oct. 17, 1540. Probably this commi&s;&s;ion was given him in con&s;equence of his former di&s;coveries.</NOTE> He arrived at Newfoundland in May of this year. Thence he &s;ailed northerly; and on the day of the fe&s;|tival of St. Lawrence, he found him&s;elf in about lati|tude 48&deg; 30&prime; north, in the mid&s;t of a broad gulf, which he named St. Lawrence. He gave the &s;ame name to the river which empties into it. In this voyage, he &s;ailed as far north as latitude 51&deg;, expecting in vain to find a pa&s;&s;age to China.</P>
<P>1535.] The next year he &s;ailed up the river St. Law|rence 300 leagues, to the great and &s;wift <HI>Fall.</HI> He called the country New France; built a fort in which he &s;pent the winter, and returned in the following &s;pring to France.</P>

On the 30th of May he arrived at Spirito Santo, from whence he travelled northward to the Chicka&s;aw country, in a|bout latitude 35&deg; or 36&deg;. He died and was buried on the bank of Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi River, May, 1542, aged 42 years. Alverdo &s;ucceeded him.</P>
<P>1542.] In 1542, Francis la Roche, Lord Robewell, was &s;ent to Canada, by the French king, with three &s;hips and 200 men, women and children. They win|tered here in a fort which they had built, and returned in the &s;pring. About the year 1550, a large number of adventurers &s;ailed for Canada, but were never after heard of. In 1598, the king of France commi&s;&s;ioned the Marquis De la Roche to conquer Canada, and other countries not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by any Chri&s;tian Prince. We

<P>1562.] The Admiral of France, Chatillon, early in this year, &s;ent out a fleet under the command of John Ribalt. He arrived at Cape Francis on the coa&s;t of Florida, near which, on the fir&s;t of May, he di&s;covered and entered a river which he called May river. It is more than probable that this river is the &s;ame which we now call St. Mary's, which forms a part of the &s;outhern boundary of the United States. As he coa&s;ted north|ward he di&s;covered eight other rivers, one of which he called Port Royal, and &s;ailed up it &s;everal leagues. On one of the rivers he built a fort and called it <HI>Charles,</HI> in which he left a colony under the direction of Captain Albert. The &s;everity of Captain Albert's mea|&s;ures excited a mutiny,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1564.</NOTE> in which, to the ruin of the colony, he was &s;lain. Two years after, Chatillon &s;ent Rene Laudonier, with three &s;hips, to Florida. In June he arrived at the river <HI>May,</HI> on which he built a fort, and, in honour to his king, Charles IX. he called it Carolina.</P>
<P>In Augu&s;t, this year, Capt. Ribalt arrived at Florida the &s;econd time, with a fleet of &s;even ve&s;&s;els, to recruit the colony, which, two years before, he had left under the direction of the unfortunate Capt. Albert.</P>
<P>The September following, Pedro Melandes, with &s;ix Spani&s;h &s;hips, pur&s;ued Ribalt up the river on which h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> had &s;ettled, and overpowering him in numbers, cruelly
<PB N="118" REF="028963_0059_0FDDBDA0FB2E67E8">ma&s;&s;acred him and his whole company. Melandes having in this way taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country, built three forts, and left them garri&s;oned with 1200 &s;oldiers. Laudonier and his colony on May river, receiving infor|mation of the fate of Ribalt, took the alarm and e&s;cap|ed to France.</P>
<P>1567.] A fleet of three &s;hips was this year &s;ent from France to Florida, under the command of Dominique de Courges. The object of this expedition, was to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s the Spaniards of that part of Florida which they had cruelly and unju&s;tifiably &s;eized three years before.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1568.</NOTE> He arrived on the coa&s;t of Flori|da, April 1568, and &s;oon after made a &s;ucce&s;&s;|ful attack upon the forts. The recent cruelty of Mel|endoes and his company excited revenge in the brea&s;t of Gourges, and rou&s;ed the unju&s;tifiable principle of re|taliation. He took the forts; put mo&s;t of the Span|iards to the &s;word; and having burned and demoli&s;hed all their fortre&s;&s;es, returned to France. During the 50 years next after this event, the French enterprized no &s;ettlements in America.</P>
<P>1576.] Capt. Frobi&s;her was &s;ent this year, to find out a north we&s;t pa&s;&s;age to the Ea&s;t Indies. The fir&s;t land which he made on the coa&s;t was a Cape, which, in honor to the queen, he called <HI>Queen Elizabeth's Fore|land.</HI> In coa&s;ting northerly he di&s;covered the &s;traits which bear his name. He pro&s;ecuted his &s;earch for a pa&s;&s;age into the we&s;tern ocean, till he was prevented by the ice, and then returned to England.

<P><HI>June</HI> 11th, 1578.] In 1578, Sir Humphry Gilbert obtained a patent from queen Elizabeth, for lands not yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by any Chri&s;tian prince, provided he would take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion within &s;ix years. With this en|couragement he &s;ailed for America,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1583.</NOTE> and on the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t 1583, anchored in Conception Bay. Afterwards he di&s;covered and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of St. John's Harbour, and the country &s;outh of it. In

<P>1584.] This year two patents were granted by queen Elizabeth, one to Admiral Gilbert, (Feb. 6.) the other to Sir Walter Raleigh (Mar. 25.) for lands not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by any Chri&s;tian Prince.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hazard's Hi&s;torical Collection, Vol. I. page 28 and 33.</NOTE> By the direction of Sir Walter, two &s;hips were fitted and &s;ent out under the command of Philip Amidas, and Arthur Barlow, with 107 pa&s;&s;angers. In June 1585 they arrived on the coa&s;t, and anchored in a harbour &s;even leagues we&s;t of the Roanoke. This colony returned to England in June, 1586. On the 13th of July, they, in a formal manner, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country, and, in honour of their virgin queen, Elizabeth, they called it <HI>Virginia.</HI> Till this time the country was known by the general name of <HI>Florida.</HI> After this Virginia became the common name for all North America.</P>
<P>1586.] This year, Sir Walter Raleigh &s;ent Sir Rich|ard Greenville to America, with &s;even &s;hips. He arrived at Wococon harbour in June. Having &s;tation|ed a colony of more than an hundred people at Roan|oke, under the direction of Capt. Ralph Lane, he coa&s;t|ed northea&s;terly as far as Che&s;apeak Bay, and returned to England.</P>
<P>The colony under Capt. Lane, endured extreme hard&s;hips, and mu&s;t have peri&s;hed, had not Sir Fran|cis Drake fortunately returned to Virginia, and car|ried them to England, after having made &s;everal con|que&s;ts for the queen in the We&s;t Indies, and other places.</P>
<P>A fortnight atter, Sir Richard Greenville arrived with new recruits; and although he did not find the colony which he had before left, and knew not but they had peri&s;hed, he had the ra&s;hne&s;s to leave 50 men at the &s;ame place.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="028963_0060_0FDDBDA280ACD230">
1587.] The year following, Sir Walter &s;ent another company to Virginia, under governour White, with a charter and twelve a&s;&s;i&s;tants. In July he arrived at Roanoke. Not one of the &s;econd company remained. He determined, however, to ri&s;k a third colony. Ac|cordingly he left 115 people at the old &s;ettlement, and returned to England.</P>
<P>This year (Aug. 13.) <HI>Manteo</HI> was baptized in Vir|ginia. He was the fir&s;t native Indian who received that ordinance in that part of America. He, with Towaye, another Indian, had vi&s;ited England, and re|turned home to Virginia with the colony. On the 18th of Augu&s;t, Mrs. Dare was delivered of a daughter, whom &s;he called <HI>Virginia.</HI> She was born at Roanoke, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as the fir&s;t Engli&s;h child that was born in North <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>1590.] In the year 1590, governour White came over to Virginia with &s;upplies and recruits for his col|ony, but, to his great grief, not a man was to be found. They had all mi&s;erably fami&s;hed with hunger, or were ma&s;&s;acred by the Indians.</P>
<P>1602.] In the &s;pring of this year, Bartholomew Go&s;|nold, with 32 per&s;ons, made a voyage to North Vir|ginia, and di&s;covered and gave names to Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard, and Elizabeth I&s;lands, and to Dover Cliff. Elizabeth I&s;land was the place which they fixed for their fir&s;t &s;ettlement. But the courage of tho&s;e who were to have tarried, failing, they all went on board and returned to England. All the attempts to &s;ettle this continent which were made by the Dutch, French, and Engli&s;h, from its di&s;covery to the pre&s;ent time, a period of 110 years, proved ineffectual. The Spaniards only, of all the European nations, had been &s;ucce&s;sful. There is no account of there having been one European family at this time, in all the va&s;t extent of coa&s;t from Florida to Greenland.</P>
<P>1693.] Martin Pring and William Brown, were this year &s;ent by Sir Walter Raleigh, with two &s;mall ve&s;&s;els,
<PB N="121" REF="028963_0060_0FDDBDA280ACD230">to make di&s;coveries in North Virginia. They came up|on the coa&s;t, which was broken with a multitude of i&s;lands, in latitude 43&deg; 30&prime; north. They coa&s;ted &s;outh|ward to Cape Cod Bay; thence round the Cape into a commodious harbour in latitude 41&deg; 25&prime;, where they went a&s;hore and tarried &s;even weeks, during which time they loaded one of their ve&s;&s;els with &s;a&s;&s;afras, and returned to England.</P>
<P>Bartholomew Gilbert, in a voyage to South Virginia, in &s;earch of the third colony which had been left there by governour White, in 1587, having touched at &s;ev|eral of the We&s;t India I&s;lands, landed near Che&s;apeak Bay, where, in a &s;kirmi&s;h with the Indians, he and four of his men were unfortunately &s;lain. The re&s;t, with|out any further &s;earch for the colony, returned to England.</P>
<P>France, being at this time in a &s;tate of tranquility, in con&s;equence of the edict of Nantz in favour of the Prote&s;tants, pa&s;&s;ed by Henry IV. (April, 1598) and of the peace with Philip, king of Spain and Portugal, was induced to pur&s;ue her di&s;coveries in America. Accord|ingly the king &s;igned a patent

<P>1605.] In May 1605, George's I&s;land and Penteco&s;t Harbour, were di&s;covered by Capt. George Weymouth. In May he entered a large river in latitude 43&deg; 20&prime;, (variation 11&deg; 15&prime; we&s;t,) which Mr. Prince, in his Chronology, &s;uppo&s;es mu&s;t have been Sagadahock; but from the latitude, it was more probably the Pi&s;cataqua.

To prevent di&s;putes about territory, the colony which &s;hould la&s;t place them&s;elves, was prohibited to plant within an hun|dred miles of the other.

The colony was chiefly indebted for its &s;ettlement and e&s;tabli&s;hment to Sir Walter Raleigh, who is &s;aid to have expended &pound; 40,000 in his different enterprizes; Lord de la War, and captain John Smith, likewi&s;e &s;pent their fortunes in labouring zealou&s;ly for its pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>An opening for a friendly intercour&s;e with the na|tives was made by the marriage of Mr. John Rolfe, a very worthy gentleman, to Pocahontas, the daughter of Bowhatan, a famous Indian chief.

<P>After her marriage, &s;he embraced the chri&s;tian re|ligion, and went to England with her hu&s;band. Capt.

<P>The Virginia company being di&s;&s;olved, the king took the colony under his immediate dependence, which oc|ca&s;ioned much confu&s;ion. Upon his death, king Charles being of the &s;ame opinion with his father as to the gov|ernment of Virginia,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1625</NOTE> he named a new governour, and council, and inve&s;ted them with an authority fully legi&s;lative and arbitrary.

<P>Being left for &s;ome years in a manner to them&s;elves, they increa&s;ed beyond expectation. They remained under the admini&s;tration of their late governours, and other officers, who re&s;pected their privileges becau&s;e they loved the colony.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="028963_0064_0FDDBDAC41257CD0">
From the year 1629, to 1639, they were ruled rath|er as the va&s;&s;als of an ea&s;tern de&s;pot, than as &s;ubjects entitled to Engli&s;h liberties; but it is to their credit that they oppo&s;ed with a firm &s;pirit, during the reign of Charles, all attempts upon their liberties.</P>
<P>In 1639, Sir William Berkely was appointed gover|nour, and his in&s;tructions tended to re&s;tore the colony to that &s;y&s;tem of freedom which they had derived from the Virginia Company, and which the writ of <HI>quo war|rant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> had involved in the &s;ame ruin with the corpora|tion it&s;elf. This lenity may partly be a&s;cribed to the &s;tate of affairs at that time, in England, the civil war having &s;oon after commenced.</P>
<P>Civil di&s;&s;en&s;ions, however, took place in the colony, which were embittered by religious differences, and in|flamed by acts made to prohibit the preaching of the doctrines of the Puritans, who wi&s;hed to purge the church of human additions, and re&s;tore it to the puri|ty of the apo&s;tolic age. The di&s;contented party, in the name of the a&s;&s;embly, petitioned the hou&s;e of com|mons, "for the re&s;toration of the ancient patents and corporation government." But the governour, council and burge&s;&s;es, no &s;ooner heard of the tran&s;action, than they tran&s;mitted an explicit di&s;avowal of it.</P>
<P>In 1642,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1642</NOTE> they declared, in the form of an act, "that they were born under monarchy, and would never degenerate from the condition of their births, by being &s;ubject to any other government."

<P>During the civil war, the Virginians remained un|alterably attached to the cau&s;e of their &s;overeign. When a republican government was e&s;tabli&s;hed in Eng|land, on the ruins of the crown, and the commons had triumphed over all their opponents, they turned their

<NOTE PLACE="marg">1650</NOTE> "for prohibiting trade with Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego." It recited, that "in Virginia, and other places in America, there are colonies which were plant|ed at the co&s;t, and &s;ettled by the people, and by the au|thority of this nation, which ought to be &s;ubordinate to, and dependent upon England. <HI>That they ever have been, and ought to be, &s;ubject to &s;uch laws and regulations as are, or &s;hall be made by the parliament.</HI> That divers acts of rebellion have been committed by many per&s;ons inhabiting Virginia, whereby they have &s;et them&s;elv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> in oppo&s;ition to this commonwealth."

<P>After the arrival of the four commi&s;&s;ioners, with the naval and military force, under captains Dennis and Claybourne, who were likewi&s;e in the commi&s;&s;ion, the Virginians refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit till articles of &s;urren|der had been agreed upon.

During the cruel reign of queen
<PB N="143" REF="028963_0071_0FDDBDBC1B0D1450">Mary, the oppo&s;ition became more general and deter|mined; and great numbers fled to and re&s;ided in for|eign parts, in order to e&s;cape per&s;ecution.</P>

<P>The clergy and laity, who wi&s;hed for greater eccle|&s;ia&s;tical purity, &s;truggled hard for the abolition of cere|monies, and habits which they thought unlawful; cere|monies which even their opponents acknowledged to be in their own nature indifferent.

<P>Five &s;hips were provided for the &s;econd embarkation of planters and &s;ervants. Mr. Francis Higgin&s;on, one of the four mini&s;ters who then came over, &s;ays in his journal, that "they arrived at Cape Ann the 27th of June, 1628, and at Naumkeag the 29th. They found at Naumkeag about 100 planters, eight hou&s;es, be&s;ides a fair hou&s;e built for Mr. Endicot. The old and new planters were about 300, of which 100 removed to Charle&s;town, where there was a hou&s;e built; the re&s;t remained at Salem. Mr. Endicot had corre&s;ponded with the &s;ettlers at Plymouth, who &s;atisfied him, that they were right in their judgments of the outward <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">m of wor&s;hip, being much like to that of the reform|ed churches in France, &amp;c. On the 20th of July, Mr. Higgin&s;on and Mr. Skelton, after fa&s;ting and prayer, were fir&s;t elected by the company for their mini&s;ters, the fir&s;t teacher, the other pa&s;tor; each of them, to|gether with three or four grave members, laying their hands on the other, with &s;olemn prayer.

<PB N="174" REF="028963_0087_0FDDBDDE83608850">a covenant in writing, which is &s;aid to be the begin|ning of the church, and that the mini&s;ters were ord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ed or in&s;tituted anew.

Two of the company, John Brown and Samuel-Brown, one a lawyer, the either a merchant, both men of good e&s;|tates and of the fir&s;t patentees, and of the council, were di&s;&s;atisfied; they did not like that the common prayer and &s;ervice of the church of England &s;hould be wholly laid a&s;ide, and therefore drew off, with as many as were of their &s;entiments, from the re&s;t, and &s;et up a &s;eparate &s;ociety.

The fir&s;t news they had, was of the general con&s;pira|cy, a few months before, of all the Indians as far as Narragan&s;et, to extirpate the Engli&s;h. Eighty per&s;ons out of about 300, had died in the colony the winter before; and many of tho&s;e that remained were in a weak, &s;ickly condition. There was not corn enough to have la&s;ted a fortnight, and all other provi&s;ions were very &s;carce.

Mr. John&s;on, her hu&s;band, died at Bo&s;ton, &s;hortly after, to the great lo&s;s of the colony. Before

They had Mr. Elliot for their mini&s;ter. Medford and Mi&s;tic were then di&s;tinct places, though not &s;o at pre&s;ent. At Medford, which I take to have been a &s;mall village at the lower part of Mi&s;tick river, now called Neck of Land, where a creek al&s;o ran into Charles river, it was intended a &s;ettle|ment &s;hould be made for Mr. Cradock and the peo|ple he was &s;ending and had &s;ent over.

The fir&s;t court of a&s;&s;i&s;tants was held at Charle&s;town, Augu&s;t 23, about two months after their arrival. The fir&s;t general court, was held the 19th of October 1630, "not by a repre&s;entative, but by every one, that was free of the corporation in per&s;on." None had been admitted freemen &s;ince they left England. The gov|ernour and a&s;&s;i&s;tants having great influence over the court, it was ordered, that, for the future, the freemen &s;hould chu&s;e the a&s;&s;i&s;tants, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tants from among them&s;elves, chu&s;e the governour and deputy governour. The court of a&s;&s;i&s;tants were to have the power of mak|ing laws and appointing officers. This was a departure from their charter. One hundred and nine freemen were admitted at this court. Maverick, Black&s;tone, and many more, who were not of any of the churches, were of this number.</P>
<P>The next general court was the court of elec|tion for 1631.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1631.</NOTE> The &s;cale was now turned, and the freemen re&s;olved to chu&s;e both governour, deputy governour and a&s;&s;i&s;tants, notwith&s;tanding the former vote, and made an order, that for the time to come, none &s;hould be admitted to the freedom of the body politic but &s;uch as were church members.</P>
<P>This law continued in force until the di&s;&s;olution of the government; it being repeated, in appearance on|ly, after the re&s;toration of Charles II. Had they been deprived of their civil privileges in England by an act of parliament, unle&s;s they would join in communion with the churches there, it might very well have been the fir&s;t in the roll of grievances. But &s;uch were the requi&s;ites to qualify for church member&s;hip here, that the grievances were abundantly greater.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>A SUCCINCT and impartial narrative of the ri&s;e, progre&s;s, and e&s;tabli&s;hment of the AMERICAN <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">EPUBLIC will be attempted in the following Chap|ters.</P>
<P>Some writers, in treating of this grand era in the hi&s;tory of mankind, have a&s;cribed the origin of the di&s;|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tes with Great Britain to the intrigues of France; without looking at the true cau&s;e, viz. the de&s;ire of lower on the one hand, and the abhorrence of oppre&s;|&s;ion on the other. There can be no doubt that the pow|ers of Europe looked with a jealous eye upon Great Brit|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, after the acqui&s;ition of &s;uch immen&s;e power and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ritories. This they thought threatened to de&s;troy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat balance of power which the &s;overeigns of Europe have for a long time endeavoured to pre&s;erve. They were, therefore, in general, di&s;po&s;ed to favour any con|vul&s;ion which promi&s;ed to dimini&s;h her overgrown treatne&s;s. It could be no wonder that France and Spain, e&s;pecially, &s;hould have embraced the fir&s;t oppor|tunity, that offered, to humble a nation, which, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her colonies, had laid their pride in the du&s;t.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid that the&s;e powers employed emi&s;&s;a|ries, immediately after the peace, to &s;ow the &s;eeds of di&s;union between Great Britain and her colonies; but this is a fact barely probable, and remains un&s;upported, as yet, by any document which the purity of hi&s;torical
<PB N="256" REF="028963_0128_0FDDBE34947E8948">truth will admit. However, it is not at all improbable that the French may have employed &s;ome per&s;ons to gain information of the di&s;po&s;itions of the Americans towards Great Britain: and it is as likely that they found out nothing to gratify their wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>Baron de Kalb, who had been long an officer in the French &s;ervice, and who was afterwards killed in the &s;ervice of the United States, travelled through the Briti&s;h provinces, about the time of the Stampact, and is &s;aid to have reported to his &s;uperiors on his return, "That the coloni&s;ts were &s;o firmly and univer&s;ally at|tached to Great Britain, that nothing could &s;hake their loyalty."</P>
<P>The ho&s;tile policy which led the colonies to examine &s;erupulou&s;ly the nature of their dependence on Great Britain followed, but did not precede, her attempts up|on the rights and liberties of America. Nor is there any ju&s;t rea&s;on to believe, that the French could, by any artifice or addre&s;s, have di&s;&s;olved the union of the Briti&s;h empire, at the clo&s;e of a war in which the in|tere&s;ts and feelings of the colonies and the parent &s;tate had been interwoven with more than u&s;ual &s;trength and energy; and that too in &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace of time, as elap&s;ed from the peace in 1763, to the promulgation of the fir&s;t obnoxious acts of the Briti&s;h parliament in 1764.</P>
<P>When the manners and habits of the Americans are con&s;idered&mdash;the equality of rank which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted among them&mdash;their independent principles&mdash;their jealous and watchful care of their con&s;titutional rights&mdash;the knowl|edge of their own &s;trength, which they had acquired in the war with France&mdash;the removal of ho&s;tile neigh|bours&mdash;their knowledge of the &s;trong factions in the parent &s;tate&mdash;What might not have been expected from &s;uch a people, in &s;uch a country, and in &s;uch a &s;ituation, when their liberties were attacked?&mdash;Could
<PB N="257" REF="028963_0128_0FDDBE34947E8948">it have been imagined that an united body of three mil|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">s of people would tamely &s;urrender up their natu|ral and chartered rights?&mdash;No! nothing but the height of infatuation could have fo&s;tered &s;o vain a hope.</P>
<P>The turbulence of &s;ome North Americans, the blun|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rs of &s;ome Briti&s;h &s;tate&s;men, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> nations, can only be con&s;idered as &s;econdary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> which effected the revolution&mdash;as circum&s;tances <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> forwarded its birth &s;omewhat &s;ooner than it would have happened in the common cour&s;e of nature.</P>
<P>It was a love of liberty and a quick &s;en&s;e of injury which led the Americans to ri&s;e in arms again&s;t the another country; at a time when there were very few who thought it their intere&s;t, or had any idea, to &s;hake of their allegiance to Britain, until the inefficacy of victions and remon&s;trances, and the progre&s;s of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, rendered the declaration of Independence to be a mea&s;ure ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for their own &s;afety. This view of the &s;ubject is not only natural and ju&s;t, but it entirely corre&s;ponds with the American character, and with the conduct which was di&s;played through all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ciffitudes that attended the revolt.</P>
<P>From the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of North America, till the clo&s;e of the war of 1755, Britain followed the wi&s;e line of conduct marked out by the charters granted to the colonies, and governed them with mutual benefit to both countries. The colonies were rather con&s;idered as in&s;truments of commerce, than as objects of govern|ment. They were allowed their own judgment in the management of their own intere&s;t. Till the year 1764, the deviations from this happy &s;y&s;tem, and the griev|ances complained of, were few; and their pre&s;&s;ure was neither great nor univer&s;al. The acts of the Briti&s;h parliament, tending to prohibit &s;everal colonial manu|factures, and lay re&s;trictions on their trade, although they bore hard upon the &s;pirits of a ri&s;ing people; yet
<PB N="258" REF="028963_0129_0FDDBE3614812928">the articles, the manufacture of which were thus pro|hibited, could be purcha&s;ed at a cheaper rate in Britain; and the advantages accruing to the colonies from their connexion with the mother country infinitely overbal|anced the evil.</P>
<P>At length the Briti&s;h parliament re&s;olved to alter the &s;y&s;tem of colonial government, by rai&s;ing a revenue in America, by taxation. Mr. I&s;rael Maudit, the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts' agent,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1763.</NOTE> gave the earlie&s;t notice of the&s;e proceedings; but, the general court of that colony not being called together till the latter end of the year, in&s;tructions to the agent, though &s;olicited by him, could not be &s;ent in &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>The next year, however, the hou&s;e of repre&s;enta|tives came to the following re&s;olutions: "That the &s;ole right of giving and granting the money of the peo|ple of that province, was ve&s;ted in them, as their legal repre&s;entatives; and that the impo&s;ition of duties and taxes, by the parliament of Great Britain, upon a peo|ple who are not repre&s;ented in the hou&s;e of commons, is ab&s;olutely irreconcilable with their rights." "That no man can ju&s;tly take the property of another without his con&s;ent; upon which original principle, the right of repre&s;entation in the &s;ame body which exerci&s;es the power of making laws for levying taxes, one of the main pillars of the <HI>Briti&s;h con&s;titution,</HI> is evidently founded."</P>
<P>The&s;e re&s;olutions were occa&s;ioned by intelligence of what had been done in the Briti&s;h hou&s;e of com|mons. It had been there debated, whether they had a <HI>right</HI> to tax the Americans, they not being repre&s;ent|ed; and determined unanimou&s;ly in the affirmative. Not a &s;ingle per&s;on pre&s;ent, ventured to controvert the right.</P>
<P>Accordingly, in March, 1764, a bill was pa&s;&s;ed, by which heavy duties were laid on goods imported by
<PB N="259" REF="028963_0129_0FDDBE3614812928">the coloni&s;ts from &s;uch We&s;t India i&s;lands as did not belong to great Britains; at the &s;ame time that the&s;e du|ties were to be paid into the exchequer in &s;pecie; and in the &s;ame &s;e&s;&s;ion another bill was framed to re&s;train the currency of paper money in the colonies them|&s;elves. Not only the principle of taxation, but the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ode of collection, was con&s;idered as an uncon&s;titu|tional and oppre&s;&s;ive innovation; for the penalties in|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">urred by an infraction of the acts of parliament, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ight be recovered in the courts of admiralty, before a &s;ingle judge, who&s;e &s;alary was the fruit of the forfeit|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">es he decreed, without trial by jury, or any of the other benefits of common law juri&s;prudence. The&s;e acts coming &s;o clo&s;e to each other, threw the whole continent into the utmo&s;t ferment.</P>
<P>The Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts a&s;&s;embly, who were the fir&s;t re|pre&s;entative body that took the act into con&s;ideration, to pointed a committee to write to the other govern|ments, and acquaint them with the in&s;tructions voted to be &s;ent to their agent; and that the &s;aid committee, in the name and behalf of the hou&s;e, &s;hould defire the &s;ev|eral a&s;&s;emblies on the continent to join with them in the &s;ame mea&s;ures.
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>June</HI> 13.</NOTE> The in&s;titution of committees of corre&s;pondence, may be con&s;id|ered as the the grand &s;pring of the revolution, during its different &s;tages. The&s;e committees, by a &s;ilent and uni|form alarm, rou&s;ed the whole body of the people, up|on all occa&s;ions, to unite in their operations again&s;t the mini&s;terial encroachments upon their privileges; and thus achieved, by the mo&s;t &s;imple means, what many of the orators and patriots of ancient a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> modern &s;tates could never effect, by the mo&s;t con&s;ummate elo|quence and abilities.</P>
<P>Vehement remon&s;trances were made to the mini&s;try, and every argument made u&s;e of that rea&s;on or ingenu|ity could &s;ugge&s;t, but to no purpo&s;e. Their rea&s;oning,
<PB N="260" REF="028963_0130_0FDDBE3C32064E10">however, convinced a great number of people in Bri|tain; and thus the American cau&s;e came to be con|&s;idered as the cau&s;e of liberty.</P>
<P>The Americans, finding all argumentation vain, at la&s;t united in an agreement to import no more of the manufactures of Great Britain, but to encourage to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> utmo&s;t of their power, every thing of that kind among them&s;elves. Thus the Briti&s;h manufacturers al&s;o be|came a party again&s;t the mini&s;try, and did not fail <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> expre&s;s their re&s;entment in the &s;tronge&s;t terms; but the mini&s;try were not to be &s;o ea&s;dy daunted, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> therefore proceeded to the la&s;t &s;tep of their inteaded plan, which was to lay on &s;tamp duties throughout the continent. Previous to this, indeed, &s;everal regula|tions were pa&s;&s;ed in favour of the commerce of the col|onies; but they had now imbibed &s;uch unfavourable &s;entiments of the Briti&s;h mini&s;try, that they paid very little regard to any thing pretended to be done in their favour; or if the&s;e acts made any favourable impre&s;&s;ions, it was quickly obliterated by the news of the Stamp act. The rea&s;on given for this act, &s;o exceedingly ob|noxious, was, that a &s;um might be rai&s;ed &s;ufficient for the defence of the colonies again&s;t a foreign enemy; but this pretence was &s;o far from giving any &s;atisfaction to the Americans, that it excited their indignation to the utmo&s;t degree. They not only a&s;&s;erted that they were abandantly able to defend them&s;elves again&s;t my foreign enemy, but denied that the Briti&s;h parliament had any right to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ax them at all.</P>
<P>The colonies denied the parliamentary right of tax|ation many months before any member of the Briti&s;h parliament uttered a &s;ingle &s;yllable to that purpo&s;e: and the American oppo&s;ition to the Stamp act was fully formed, before it was known by the coloni&s;ts that their cau&s;e was e&s;pou&s;ed by any man of note at home, as Britain was &s;tyled.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="028963_0130_0FDDBE3C32064E10">
The rai&s;ing of a revenue from the mola&s;&s;es trade, and a fund to defray the expences of defending the colonies, were in contemplatian nine years before; but the re&s;o|lutions taken by the hou&s;e of commons, in the be|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aning of this year, might be forwarded by Mr. Hu&s;ke, a American, a native of Port&s;mouth in New Hamp&s;hire, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a &s;hort time before obtained a &s;eat in parliament. In&s;tead of &s;tanding forth a firm advocate for the coun|try which gave him birth, he officiou&s;ly propo&s;ed to the hou&s;e, laying a tax on the colonies, that &s;hould annually <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ount to five hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> declared they were well able to pay: and he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ard with great joy and attention. He or &s;ome oth|er recollecting that a &s;tamp act was talked of by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">mmi&s;&s;ioners at Albany, in 1754, may have &s;ugge&s;ted that mode of taxing, for whatever was thought, the &s;tamp act was not originally Mr. Grenville's.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gordon's Am. Rev. Vol. I. p. 157.</NOTE></P>
<P>The intended &s;tamp act, was communicated to the American agents. Many of them did not oppo&s;e it. Half their number were placement, or dependent on the mini&s;try. Mr. Jo&s;eph Sherwood <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> hone&s;t quaker, agent for Rhode I&s;land, refu&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">a&s;&s;ent to America's being taxed by a Briti&s;h parliament. Mr. Mauduit, the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts agent, favoured the rai&s;ing of the wanted money by a &s;tamp duty, as it would occa&s;ion le&s;s ex|pence of officers, and would include the We&s;t India i&s;lands. But the &s;cheme was po&s;tponed, and the agents authorized to inform the American a&s;&s;emblies, that they were at liberty to &s;ugge&s;t any other way of rai&s;ing monies; and that Mr. Grenville was ready to receive propo&s;als for any other tax, that might be equivalent in its produce to the &s;tamp tax. The colonies &s;eemed to con&s;ider it as an affront, rather than a compliment. He would not have been content with any thing &s;hort of a certain &s;peci&s;ic &s;um, and proper funds for the
<PB N="262" REF="028963_0131_0FDDBE3EB1A85378">payment of it. Had not the &s;ums been an&s;werable to his wi&s;hes, he would have rejected them; and he would &s;carce have been &s;atisfied with le&s;s than 300,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> annum, which was judged ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to de|fray the whole expence of the army propo&s;ed for the defence of America: he might rather have expected that it &s;hould amount to what Mr. Hu&s;ke had mention|ed. No &s;atisfactory propo&s;als being made, he adhered to his purpo&s;e of bringing forward the &s;tamp bill, though repeatedly pre&s;&s;ed by &s;ome of his friends to de&s;i&s;t, what he might have done it with honour. Richard Jack&s;on, e&s;q. had been cho&s;en agent for the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, with Mr. Inger&s;oll, Mr. Garth, and Mr. Franklin, late|ly come from Philadelphia, waited on Mr. Grenville, the &s;econd of February, 1765, by de&s;ire of the colonial agents,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1765. <HI>Feb.</HI> 2.</NOTE> to remon&s;trate again&s;t the &s;tamp bill, and to propo&s;e that in ca&s;e an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> tax mu&s;t be laid upon America, the &s;everal colonies might be permitted to lay the tax them&s;elves. At this interview Mr. Jack&s;on opened his mind freely on the &s;ubject; and Mr. Franklin, as mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed, mentioned that he had it in in&s;truction from the a&s;|&s;embly of Penn&s;ylvania, to a&s;&s;ure the mini&s;try, that they &s;hould always think it their duty to grant &s;uch aids to the crown, as were &s;uitable to their circum|&s;tances, whenever called for in the u&s;ual con&s;titutional manner. Mr. Grenville however, pertinaciou&s;ly ad|hered to his own opinions; and &s;aid, that he had pledged his word for offering the &s;tamp bill to the hou&s;e, and that the hou&s;e would hear their objections.</P>
<P>The bill was brought in; and on the fir&s;t reading, Mr. Charles Town&s;end &s;poke in its favour. He took notice of &s;everal things that colonel Barre had &s;aid in his &s;peech again&s;t it; and then concluded with the fol|lowing or like words: "And now will the&s;e Ameri|cans, children planted by our care; nouri&s;hed up by our

<P>During the debate on the bill, the &s;upporters of it in&s;i&s;ted much on the colonies being virtually repre|&s;ented in the &s;ame manner as Leeds, Halifax, and &s;ome other towns were. A recurrence to this plea, was a virtual acknowledgment, that there ought not to be tax|ation without repre&s;entation. It was replied, that the connexion between the electors and non electors of parliament in Great Britain, was &s;o interwoven, from both being equally liable to pay the &s;ame common tax, and to give &s;ome &s;ecurity of property to the latter: but with re&s;pect to taxes laid by the Briti&s;h parliament, and paid by the Americans, the &s;ituation of the parties was rever&s;ed. In&s;tead of both parties bearing a propor|tionable &s;hare of the &s;ame common burden, what was laid on the one, was exactly &s;o much taken off from the other.</P>

<P>The a&s;&s;emblies of Virginia, North Carolina, and Georgia, were prevented, by their governours, from finding a deputation to this congre&s;s. Twenty eight deputies from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, Rhode I&s;land, Connecti|cut, New York, New Jer&s;ey, Penn&s;ylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and South Carolina, met at New York, and after mature deliberation agreed on a declaration of
<PB N="270" REF="028963_0135_0FDDBE414F178E50">their rights, and on a &s;tatement of their grievances. They a&s;&s;erted in &s;trong terms, their exemption from all taxes, not impo&s;ed by their own repre&s;entatives. They al&s;o concurred in a petition to the king, and memorial to the hou&s;e of lords, and a petition to the hou&s;e of commons. The colonies that were prevented from &s;ending their repre&s;entatives to this congre&s;s, for|warded petitions, &s;imilar to tho&s;e which were adopted by the deputies which attended.</P>
<P>Some &s;peakers of great weight, in both hou&s;es of parliament, denied their right of taxing the colonies. The chief &s;upporters of this opinion were lord Cam|den in the hou&s;e of peers, and Mr. Pitt in the hou&s;e of commons. The former in nervous language &s;aid, "Bly po&s;ition is this, I repeat it, I will maintain it to my la&s;t hour. Taxation and repre&s;entation are in&s;eparable. This po&s;ition is founded on the laws of nature. It is more, it is it&s;elf an eternal law of nature. For what|ever is a man's own, is ab&s;olutely his own. No man has a right to take it from him without his con&s;ent. Whoever attempts to do it attempts an injury, whoev|er does it commits a robbery." Mr. Pitt, with great boldne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion, ju&s;tified the coloni&s;ts, in oppo&s;|ing the &s;tamp act. "You have no right," &s;aid he, "to tax America. I rejoice that America has re&s;i&s;ted. Three millions of our fellow &s;ubjects &s;o lo&s;t to every &s;en&s;e of virtue, as tamely to give up their liberties, would be fit in&s;truments to make &s;laves of the re&s;t."

<P>Dr. Benjamin Franklin was examined at the bar of the hou&s;e of commons, upon this occa&s;ion; and his informa|tion tended much to remove prejudices, and promoted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;po&s;ition favourable to a repeal of this obnoxious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ill.</P>
<P>After much debating, and two prote&s;ts in the hou&s;e of lords, and pa&s;&s;ing an act "For &s;ecuring the depend|ance of America on Great Britain," the repeal of the &s;tamp act was finally carried: and on the 19th of March, 1766, the king went to the hou&s;e of peers and pa&s;&s;ed the bill, to the univer&s;al joy of the Americans, and indeed to the great &s;atisfaction of the Briti&s;h, who&s;e manufactures began to &s;uffer very &s;eriou&s;ly, in con&s;equence of the American a&s;&s;ociation again&s;t them.</P>

The oppo&s;ers of the repeal had contended for the declaratory bill, as e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary.

<P>Matters now ha&s;tened to a cri&s;is. The governour had been ordered to proceed with vigour, and by no means to &s;how any di&s;po&s;ition to yield to the people as formerly. In particular they were required to re&s;cind that re&s;olution by which they had written the circular letter above mentioned; and in ca&s;e of a refu&s;al, it was told them that they would be di&s;&s;olved. As this letter had been framed by the re&s;olutions of a former hou&s;e, they de&s;ired, after a week's con&s;ultation, that a rece&s;s might be granted to con&s;ult with their con&s;tituents; but this being refu&s;ed, they came to a determination, 92 again&s;t 17, to adhere to the re&s;olution which pro|duced the circular letter. At the &s;ame time a letter was &s;ent to lord Hill&s;borough, and a me&s;&s;age to the gov|ernour, in ju&s;tification of their proceedings. In both they expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves with &s;uch freedom as was by no means calculated to accord with the &s;entiments of

<P>The governour now took the la&s;t &s;tep in his power to put a &s;top to the violent proceedings of the a&s;&s;embly, by di&s;&s;olving it entirely; but this was of little moment. Their behaviour had been highly approved by the other colonies, who had written letters to them expre&s;&s;ive of their approbation.

Whil&s;t the di&s;po&s;ition of the Bo&s;tonians was thus go|ing on from bad to wor&s;e, news arrived that the agent for the colony had not been allowed to deliver their petition to the king; it having been objected, that the a&s;&s;embly, without the governour, was not &s;ufficient a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|thority.

<P>On the 5th of March 1770, a &s;euffle happen|ed between the &s;oldiers and a party of the town's people.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770.</NOTE> The inhabitants poured in from

The whole province now ro&s;e in arms, and the &s;oldiers were obliged to retire to Ca&s;tle William, to remove any pretext for farther di&s;turbances. It ap|peared on the trial, that the &s;oldiers had been abu&s;ed, in&s;ulted, threatened and pelted, before they fired. It was al&s;o proved that only &s;even mu&s;kets were fired by the eight pri&s;oners. The captain and &s;ix of the men were acquitted, and two were found guilty of man|&s;laughter. "The re&s;ult of the trial reflected great honour on John Adams and Jo&s;iah Quincey, the coun&s;el for the pri&s;oners; and al&s;o on the integrity of the jury, who ventured to give an upright verdict, in defiance of popular opinions."

<P>The con&s;equences of this tragical event, &s;unk deep in the minds of the people, and were made &s;ub&s;ervient to important purpo&s;es. "The anniver&s;ary of it was ob&s;erved with great &s;olemnity for thirteen years.

<P>Having thus procured the removal of the military, the determinations of the people, in other re&s;pects, continued if po&s;&s;ible more firm than ever, until at la&s;t government, determining to act with vigour, and at the &s;ame time to behave with as much conde&s;cen&s;ion as

The event &s;howed that their opinion was well founded. The Americans oppo&s;ed the tea tax with the &s;ame vio|lence as they had done all the re&s;t: and at la&s;t, on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ws that &s;alaries had been &s;ettled on the ju&s;tices of the &s;uperior court of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, the governour was addre&s;&s;ed on the &s;ubject; the mea&s;ure was con|lemned in the &s;tronge&s;t terms; and a committee, &s;elected out of the &s;everal di&s;tricts of the colony; appointed to inquire into it.</P>
<P>The new a&s;&s;embly proceeded in the mo&s;t formal man|ner to di&s;avow the &s;upremacy of the Briti&s;h legi&s;lature; and accu&s;ed the parliament of Britain of having violated the natural rights of the Americans in a number of la&s;tances. Copies of the tran&s;actions of this a&s;&s;embly were tran&s;mitted to every town in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, ex|horting the inhabitants to rou&s;e them&s;elves, and exert every nerve in oppo&s;ition to the iron hand of oppre&s;&s;ion, which was daily tearing the choice&s;t fruits from the fair tree of liberty.</P>
<P>The rigorous execution of the &s;muggling laws, gave occa&s;ion to the fir&s;t daring act of violence, which might, with propriety, be called an act of ho&s;tility again&s;t government. This happened at Providence in Rhode I&s;land, where, on the 10th of June 1772, the Ga&s;pee

A reward of &pound;.500 was offered for the di&s;covery of tho&s;e concerned; but &s;o a|greeable was it to the univer&s;al voice of the people, that not one man was found to accept the offered reward.</P>
<P>The di&s;turbances were greatly heightened in Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts by an accidental di&s;covery that Mr. Hutchin|&s;on, governour of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, had written &s;ev|eral confidential letters to people in power in England, complaining of the behaviour of the province, recom|mending vigorous mea&s;ures again&s;t them, and, among other things, a&s;&s;erting, that "there mu&s;t be an abridg|ment of what is called Briti&s;h liberty." Letters of this kind had fallen into the hands of Dr. Benjamin Franklin, the agent for the colony at London.

<P>A brief Account of the Political Di&s;putes which convul&s;ed Great Britain, from the beginning of the Reign of George III. till the Commencement of Ho&s;tilities in America.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the ju&s;t grounds of com|plaint which led the Americans to oppo&s;e with vigour, the arbitrary de&s;igns of the Briti&s;h mini&s;try, it would be difficult to account &s;atisfactorily for their regular and &s;teady oppo&s;ition, from the beginning of the di&s;putes, and even after ho&s;tilities commeneed, with|out taking a view of the di&s;&s;en&s;ions which agitated Britain during the &s;ame period.</P>
<P>The feuds and animo&s;ities which the Middle&s;ex elec|tion excited, gave occa&s;ion to &s;udden changes of the mini&s;try, and re&s;olutions of parliament dangerous to the liberties of the people; which, probably, would never el&s;e have taken place. As this election is the great hinge upon which the political events of the reign of George III. for many years turned, every material circum&s;tance relating to that &s;ingular tran&s;action, and even to Mr. Wilkes, the principal agent concerned in it, &s;hall be particularly attended to, con&s;i&s;tently with the limits of this work.</P>
<P>Till the re&s;ignation of Mr. Pitt, (October 9, 1761) no material change had been made in the mini&s;try dur|ing
<PB N="282" REF="028963_0141_0FDDBE4F98D30AA0">the fir&s;t year of the reign of George III. It continued nearly the &s;ame as it was at the death of the late king; with only this difference, that lord Bute, who was &s;up|po&s;ed to be a particular favourite of the pre&s;ent king, had been introduced into the cabinet, and appointed &s;e|cretary of &s;tate in the room of the earl of Holder|ne&s;s. A more important alteration took place in 1762. An opinion had been long entertained, at lea&s;t it was indu&s;triou&s;ly propagated by certain per&s;ons, that the Pelham family had been as complete ma&s;ters of the cabinet during the latter years of the la&s;t reign, as ever the Marlborough family was, during a great part of that of queen Anne. A re&s;olution, it is &s;aid, was therefore taken to get rid of the Pelhams and all their connections. The duke of Newca&s;tle was made &s;o un|ea&s;y in his &s;ituation, that he re&s;igned his po&s;t of fir&s;t lord of the trea&s;ury, and was &s;ucceeded by the earl of Bute. This gave occa&s;ion to a mo&s;t furious paper war be|tween the friends and adherents of the&s;e two noble|men, and naturally tended to revive in the kingdom, that &s;pirit of party, which, during the &s;ucce&s;sful admin|i&s;tration of Mr. Pitt, had, in a great mea&s;ure, been laid a&s;leep. Dr. Gold&s;mith ob&s;erves, that the earl of Bute was believed to be a man of ability and even of virtue, but deficient in that ea&s;ine&s;s of addre&s;s and tho&s;e engaging manners, without which no mini&s;ter can ever expect to be long popular in England. As he was a man of ta&s;te and learning, had he continued groom of the &s;tate, as he was at the time of the king's acce&s;&s;ion, he might have ea&s;ily pa&s;&s;ed for the Macenas of the age. Every favour which the king might have be&s;towed upon men of letters, would have been con|&s;idered as originating from his advice; whereas, by plunging into politics, for which, as he was not bred to them, perhaps he was but ill qualified, he at once de|&s;troyed the peace of his own mind, dimini&s;hed for a
<PB N="283" REF="028963_0141_0FDDBE4F98D30AA0">while the popularity of his &s;overeign, and di&s;tracted and perplexed the councils of his country.</P>
<P>The cry of favouriti&s;m, which was rai&s;ed again&s;t lord Bute, immediately upon his introduction into the mini&s;try, had hitherto been kept up with the utmo&s;t virulence and animo&s;ity. Having completed the peace in 1763, he re&s;igned his place, as fir&s;t lord of the trea|&s;ury, in April, in the &s;ame year, and was &s;ucceeded by Mr. George Grenville.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit of venality and corruption was remarka|bly prevalent at this time in Britain. Licentiou&s;ne&s;s and riot were become general among the lower ranks; and tumults, and a &s;pirit of di&s;order, affected mo&s;t parts of the kingdom.</P>
<P>During the earl of Bute's admini&s;tration, the Engli&s;h populace re&s;igned all their thinking faculties, and even their &s;en&s;es, to the indefatigable incendiaries of a bold and in&s;olent faction, who were overawed by no au|thority, and re&s;trained by no principle; till at length the animo&s;ity to the Scotch in general, and the aver&s;ion to the mini&s;ter in particular, proceeded to an amazing degree of infatuation.</P>
<P>The jealou&s;y of the Engli&s;h nation, towards their fellow &s;ubjects on the other &s;ide of the Tweed, had di&s;covered it&s;elf occa&s;ionally ever &s;ince the union of the crowns; and the ancient animo&s;ities had been kept alive by the two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive rebellions which began in Scotland; but the common grudge was founded upon the &s;ucce&s;s of the Scotch, who had e&s;tabli&s;hed them|&s;elves in different parts of England, and ri&s;en from very &s;mall beginnings, to wealth and con&s;ideration. In a word, the Engli&s;h looked upon them with an evil eye, as interlopers in commerce and competitors for reputa|tion. It was not without murmuring that they had &s;een them a&s;pire to the fir&s;t offices in the law, the army, and the navy; but they were exa&s;perated to find a Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t
<PB N="284" REF="028963_0142_0FDDBE5738626320">at the head of the Engli&s;h trea&s;ury, and the chief ad|mini&s;tration of the kingdom in his hands. The&s;e were topics on which the writers in the oppo&s;ition did not fail to expatiate. They revived and retailed with pe|culiar virulence, all the calumnies, ancient and modern, that ever had been uttered again&s;t the Scotch nation, &s;ome of them &s;o gro&s;s and ab&s;urd, that they could not po&s;&s;ibly obtain credit but among the very dregs of the people. They enlarged upon their craft, di&s;&s;imulation, deceit, and national partiality. They denounced the dangers that threatened the intere&s;ts of Old England, from the great numbers of tho&s;e northern adventurers, who had wriggled them&s;elves into all the different de|partments of civil and military in&s;titution; and they in&s;i&s;ted upon the di&s;grace of acquie&s;cing under the gov|ernment of a North Briton, a Stuart, allied by blood to the pretender, who had expelled from court the be&s;t friends of the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, a&s;&s;ociated him&s;elf with avowed tories, who pro&s;tituted the offices, and &s;quandered away the wealth of England on worthle&s;s favourites of his own country. The&s;e bitter remon|&s;trances, in which no regard was paid either to truth or decency, they reinforced with feigned circum&s;tances, and forged li&s;ts of North Britons gratified with pen|&s;ions, appointed to places, or promoted in the &s;ervice, till at length the populace were incen&s;ed even to the verge of in&s;urrection. Had the natives of North Bri|tain proved equally combu&s;tible, the flames of civil war would have certainly been kindled; and, in that ca&s;e, the ruin of a mighty nation might have been effected by two or three infamous emi&s;&s;aries, equally de&s;perate and ob&s;cure, who either pro&s;tituted their pens to a party for hire, or exerci&s;ed their talents for abu&s;e, in hope of be|ing bought off by the mini&s;ter.</P>

<PB N="285" REF="028963_0142_0FDDBE5738626320">compared to tho&s;e which were circulated through the nation, after the re&s;ignation of Mr. Pitt. Had the pro|mulgators of the fir&s;t defamatory libels that appeared again&s;t the king and his family been apprehended, and puni&s;hed in the ordinary cour&s;e of law proceedings, the &s;ection would have found it a very difficult ta&s;k, in the &s;equel, to engage either printer or publi&s;her in their &s;ervice; and, in all probability, the evil would have been cru&s;hed in the bud; but they were emboldened by impunity to proceed in their career, to confirm their calumnies by unrefuted fal&s;ehoods, and to give rein to the mo&s;t audacious &s;currility; until the minds of the people were &s;o deeply and univer&s;ally tainted, that it became hazardous to call the libeliers to account, and very doubtful whether a jury could be found in the capital, that would &s;urrender tho&s;e new idols to the ca&s;tigation of the law.</P>
<P>The new mini&s;try &s;howed the &s;ame contempt and di&s;regard of all the abu&s;e offered to their per&s;ons, in the papers and pamphlets publi&s;hed again&s;t them, as their predece&s;&s;ors in office had done,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1763.</NOTE> although their names were printed at full length in many audacious libels; e&s;pecially in a periodical paper called the North Briton. Mr. John Wilkes, member of par|liament for Ayle&s;bury, was at very little pains to con|ceal that he was the author of this paper, which in point of wit, language or argument, could never have attracted the attention of the public, had not the minds of the people, by the arts of faction, been inflamed to a degree of madne&s;s. Wilkes was lively, but &s;uperfi|cial; and, in his morals, he was &s;aid to be di&s;&s;ipated even to profligacy. He had more than once applied to the new mini&s;ters for a po&s;t that might repair his &s;hat|tered fortunes; but prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, ari&s;ing from his character, were &s;o &s;trong again&s;t him, that failing of &s;ucce&s;s, he re&s;olved, as he openly declared, to try how far it was practicable to carry the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of
<PB N="286" REF="028963_0143_0FDDBE58B43D2758">writing, under pretext of exerci&s;ing the liberty of the pre&s;s. Perceiving the next to &s;toical indifference of the mini&s;try with regard to their own per&s;ons, he aim|ed his abu&s;e at the king him&s;elf, and in the forty fifth number of his paper, animadverted upon the king's &s;peech in parliament, with an acrimony &s;o indecent towards his maje&s;ty's probity as well as per&s;on, that the mini&s;ters, at length, gave orders for &s;eizing the printer, and all concerned in the publication. The&s;e orders were contained in a warrant of a general nature, under the hand of lord Halifax, directed to four of his maje&s;ty's me&s;&s;engers, commanding them to apprehend, without &s;pecifying their names, the authors, printers, and publi&s;hers of that &s;editious and trea&s;onable paper; and the publi&s;her, George Kear&s;ley, being accordingly apprehended, his examination afforded &s;ufficient ground for fixing upon Mr. Wilkes as the author. This war|rant, though afterwards pronounced to be illegal by a lord chief ju&s;tice, was, in point of form and &s;ub&s;tance, the &s;ame that had always been i&s;&s;ued by former &s;ecreta|ries of &s;tate, and even by Mr. Pitt and the duke of Newca&s;tle, who&s;e party now openly contended, that it was &s;ubver&s;ive of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Mr. Wilkes was thereupon committed pri&s;oner to the tower,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1763. <HI>April</HI> 30.</NOTE> and his papers being &s;ealed up in pre&s;ence of the under &s;ecretary of &s;tate and the &s;olicitor of the trea&s;ury, were &s;eized.</P>
<P>Mr. Wilkes, upon bringing his <HI>habeas corpus</HI> before the court of common pleas, was relea&s;ed from the tow|er by a deci&s;ion of that court, the judges of which unanimou&s;ly declared that privilege of parliament ex|tended to the ca&s;e of writing a libel.</P>
<P>In the mean time the per&s;onal veracity of Mr. Wilkes received a &s;evere &s;hock, by his being called up|on, in the public papers, to make good an a&s;&s;ertion he
<PB N="287" REF="028963_0143_0FDDBE58B43D2758"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad advanced in his &s;peech at the court of common <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">as, that corrupt offers had been made to him by the government; and to declare when, how, or by whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ch offers were made, and what they were? Neither Mr. Wilkes, nor any of his friends, thought proper to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> any notice of this peremptory challenge, though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> repeated, and affecting his moral character in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;t &s;en&s;ible manner.</P>
<P>When the affair, in con&s;equence of his maje&s;ty's me&s;&s;age, came under con&s;ideration in the hou&s;e of com|mons, it admitted of great debates. It was &s;trongly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ged by the gentlemen in the oppo&s;ition, that no pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ter liberties had been taken by the author of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ious paper, with regard to his maje&s;ty's &s;peech, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">an what had been common upon former occa&s;ions of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ame kind; and that the &s;peech of the king had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">er been con&s;idered in any other light than that of the mini&s;ter, and had always been treated with equal freedom. The hou&s;e, however, was of opinion, that under no former oppo&s;ition &s;uch abu&s;ive terms, or &s;o per&s;onally di&s;re&s;pectful to maje&s;ty, had ever been made u&s;e of; and therefore it was re&s;olved by a great major|ty, "That the paper, intitled the North Briton, No. 45, is a fal&s;e, &s;candalous, and &s;editious libel, containing expre&s;&s;ions of the mo&s;t unexampled in&s;olence and con|tumely towards his maje&s;ty, the gro&s;&s;e&s;t a&s;per&s;ions up|on both hou&s;es of parliament, and the mo&s;t audacious defiance of the authority of the whole legi&s;lature; and mo&s;t manife&s;tly tending to alienate the affections of the people from his maje&s;ty, to withdraw them from their obedience to the laws of the realm, and to excite them to traitorous in&s;urrections." The hou&s;e likewi&s;e de|termined that the privilege of parliament did not ex|tend to the ca&s;e of writing &s;uch a libel. A number of members &s;poke and voted again&s;t the latter re&s;olution, only becau&s;e they thought it was a matter founded in
<PB N="288" REF="028963_0144_0FDDBE5A2796E728">the con&s;titution, independent of all party con&s;ideration. Soon after Mr. Wilkes fought a duel with Mr. Martin, a member of parliament, and late &s;ecretary to the trea&s;ury, who&s;e character he had attacked in his writ|ings, in the mo&s;t barefaced manner. In this engage|ment both parties behaved like men of courage; but Mr. Wilkes was wounded in the body &s;o dangerou&s;ly, that he was in no condition to appear in the hou&s;e of commons when the matter of his complaint of breach of privilege was to be heard.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t this matter was depending, the &s;heriffs of London, the hon. Mr. Harley and Richard Blunt,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1763. <HI>Nov.</HI> 19.</NOTE> e&s;q. endeavoured to execute the order of the two hou&s;es of parliament, by burning the 45th number of the North Briton, by the hands of the common hangman, at the Royal Ex|change; but the mob proved &s;o riotous on this occa|&s;ion, that they re&s;cued the paper from the executioner before it was con&s;umed, pelted the con&s;tables and oth|er peace officers, and even put Mr. &s;heriff Harley in danger of his life.</P>
<P>The walls of parliament as yet contained the debates on the whole affair, which was of far greater import|ance than the public at fir&s;t apprehended. The re&s;o|lutions of neither hou&s;e could determine the great points depending on it, for tho&s;e were cognizable only in a court of law. In the July preceding, the journey|men printers, who had been &s;eized and confined on &s;u&s;picion of printing the North Briton, brought actions again&s;t the me&s;&s;engers on that account. On the fir&s;t action that was tried, the plaintiff recovered 300<ABBR>l.</ABBR> dam|ages, and 200<ABBR>l.</ABBR> was allowed to each of the others, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> thirteen in number. It appeared from tho&s;e tri|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, that the plaintiffs were not really guilty of the fact <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> which they had been &s;eized. That the me&s;&s;engers had been mi&s;led by the general terms of the warrant;
<PB N="289" REF="028963_0144_0FDDBE5A2796E728">and that room was left for conte&s;ting their validity. At the &s;ame time the cooler and more judicious part <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the public thought the damages, con&s;idering the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and circum&s;tances of the parties, were exorbitant; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that the verdicts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> their favour would only &s;erve <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> exa&s;perate the mini&s;ters, when it &s;hould be their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to pro&s;ecute. Mr. Wilkes, who no doubt was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ghly encouraged by the verdicts the printers had ob|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ned, brought his action likewi&s;e again&s;t the late &s;ec|tary of &s;tate for &s;eizing his papers; and, on the 6th <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> December, after a hearing of near fifteen hours be|fore lord chief ju&s;tice Pratt, and a &s;pecial jury, in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">rt of common pleas, he obtained a verdict, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">00<ABBR>l.</ABBR> damages, and co&s;ts of &s;uit. In the charge giv|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> on this occa&s;ion by the judge to the jury, his lord&s;hip <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nounced the warrant under which Mr. Wilkes was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ed, illegal; but very mode&s;tly &s;ubmitted his opinion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the other judges and the hou&s;e of peers, ending his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ech with the following remarkable words: "If the&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">gher juri&s;dictions &s;hould declare my opinion errone|ous, I &s;ubmit, as will become me, and ki&s;s the rod; but I mu&s;t &s;ay, I &s;hall always con&s;ider it as a rod of iron <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the cha&s;ti&s;ement of the people of Great Britain."</P>
<P>In the month of January, 1764, Mr. Wilkes was expelled the hou&s;e of commons;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1764.</NOTE> and not appearing to the indictments preferred again&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> for publi&s;hing the North Briton, and for &s;ome oth|er charges, he was at la&s;t run to an utlawry; and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">; which he had commenced again&s;t the &s;ecretaries <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;tate for fal&s;e impri&s;onment, fell of cour&s;e to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ound.</P>
<P>Hitherto the demerits of Mr. Wilkes, whatever private irregularities of life he might have been accu&s;|ed of, were con&s;idered by the public only politically, and he had many advocates among the virteous, well di&s;po&s;ed part of mankind; when, all of a &s;udden, a
<PB N="290" REF="028963_0145_0FDDBE5BA0D142A8">&s;torm broke out upon him in the hou&s;e of peers which expo&s;ed him in a mo&s;t unchri&s;tian and immoral light. One of the principal &s;ecretaries of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e accu&s;ed Mr. Wilkes, in the hou&s;e of lords, of violating the mo&s;t &s;acred ties of religion as well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">decency, by printing in his own hou&s;e, a book or pamphlet, entitled, "A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> E&s;&s;ay on Woman, with notes or remarks." This com|plaint could not have properly come before their lord|&s;hips, had not the name of a right reverend pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> been mo&s;t &s;currilou&s;ly introduced, as being the author of the notes. The book it&s;elf, though printed with the utmo&s;t &s;ecre&s;y, had been communicated, through Mr. Wilkes's own inadvertency, to the &s;ecretary, by a journeyman printer, who was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a copy, and the very mention of its contents &s;truck the public with horrour. The concern which the pretended patriot had in printing and correcting the pre&s;s, was proved beyond all contradiction; and left upon the minds of the public a &s;trong conviction of his being the author al&s;o. Scarcely any defence was made for him by his friends, and the hou&s;e addre&s;&s;ed his maje&s;ty to give or|ders that he &s;hould be pro&s;ecuted; but neither this ad|dre&s;s, nor the pro&s;ecutions intended to be brought a|gain&s;t him for breach of privilege, had any other effect, than that of greatly increa&s;ing the number of his ene|mies in the rational unprejudiced part of the nation. However, many &s;till remained his political friends, who dete&s;ted his profligate principles. General warrants were afterwards declared to be illegal by a re&s;olution of both hou&s;es; and this, indeed, &s;eems to be the chief advantage re&s;ulting from this violent di&s;pute between Mr. Wilkes and the mini&s;try.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit of party, which was now &s;o general as well as violent, was attended with one very great in|convenience. It was productive of &s;uch a mutability in public men, and con&s;equently in public mea&s;ures
<PB N="291" REF="028963_0145_0FDDBE5BA0D142A8">and coun&s;els, that a new mini&s;try and new mea&s;ures com|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nced almo&s;t with every new year. This naturally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ded to weaken the authority of government both at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ne and abroad. Foreign nations were aver&s;e to en|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> into any clo&s;e connexion or alliance with a people, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">o&s;e public mea&s;ures were &s;o very fluctuating; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> inferior ranks of men in Britain lo&s;t all that rever|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e and re&s;pect for their rulers which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;upport of order and good government. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">enville admini&s;tration was now forced to make way for that of the marquis of Rockingham. The chief bu&s;ine&s;s of this mini&s;try was to undo all that their predece&s;&s;ors had done,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1765.</NOTE> particularly appealing the &s;tamp and cider acts; as on the other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">nd, all that they now did, was, in its turn, undone <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in office.</P>
<P>In 1768, the parliament being di&s;&s;olved, writs were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed for electing a new one. Mr. Wilkes, who had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ained abroad on outlaw ever &s;ince the year 1763, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> returned home, and even when the outlawry was in full force, offered him&s;elf a candidate for the county of Middle&s;ex,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1768.</NOTE> for which he was cho&s;en, in oppo&s;ition to &s;ir William Beauchamp Proctor, one of the former members, by a very great majority. Great doubts were at fir&s;t entertained <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ther an outlaw could be cho&s;en a member of par|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ent; but &s;o many precedents were produced in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">mative, that the legality of the practice was put be|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d controver&s;y. Being now &s;ecure, as he thought, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a &s;eat in parliament, Mr. Wilkes &s;urrendered him|&s;elf to the court of king's bench, by whom the out|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">wry was rever&s;ed, and he was &s;entenced to &s;uffer an impri&s;onment of two years, and to pay a fine of a thou&s;and pounds. As he was e&s;teemed by many per|&s;ons as a kind of martyr in the cau&s;e of public liberty, a &s;ub&s;cription was opened by &s;ome merchants of Lon|don,
<PB N="292" REF="028963_0146_0FDDBE5D90FF2688">and other gentlemen of property, for paying his fine, &s;upporting him whil&s;t in pri&s;on, and compounding his debts, amounting to above twenty thou&s;and pounds; and all the&s;e purpo&s;es were, in the end, completely ac|compli&s;hed.</P>
<P>When the new parliament met, the people imagined that Mr. Wilkes would take his &s;eat along with the other members. In expectation of this, ma|ny of them a&s;&s;embled in St. George's Fields,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1768. <HI>May</HI> 10.</NOTE> near the king's bench pri&s;on, where he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> confined, with a view of conducting him to the hou&s;e of commons. The furry ju&s;tices &s;oon came among them, and the riot act was read; but the peo|ple not di&s;per&s;ing, the military were called in, and were ordered, perhaps unadvi&s;edly, to fire. Several per&s;ons were &s;lightly wounded, two or three mortally, and one was killed on the &s;pot.</P>
<P>Lord Weymouth, one of the &s;ecretaries of &s;tate, &s;ent a letter to the ju&s;tices, thanking them for their &s;pirited conduct in this affair. Mr. Wilkes, who was no incurious, nor, we may believe, unconcerned &s;pec|tator of the whole &s;cene, took this opportunity of ex|pre&s;&s;ing his re&s;entment again&s;t the mini&s;try, whom he regarded as the authors of all the per&s;ecutions he had &s;uffered. He publi&s;hed lord Weymouth's letter, with a few remarks of his own prefixed to it, in which the termed the affair of St. George's Fields a horrid ma&s;&s;a|cre; and this &s;tep was either con&s;idered as a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, or was made a pretence, for expelling him the hou&s;e: otherwi&s;e it became in a manner impo&s;&s;ible to tell for what rea&s;on he had been expelled. The two offences for which this puni&s;hment had been inflicted, were, the publication of the North Briton, and an ob&s;cen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> pamphlet, called "An E&s;&s;ay on Woman." With re|&s;pect to the former, he had been puni&s;hed in a pre|ceding parliament, and it was contrary to law to try
<PB N="293" REF="028963_0146_0FDDBE5D90FF2688">him for it a &s;econd time. As to the latter, he received <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tence for it from the hou&s;e of lords in a former par|liament al&s;o; but the&s;e offences were not e&s;teemed magnizable by the commons; and as for the comment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> lord Weymouth's letter, it was as little within their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">i&s;diction.</P>
<P>The freeholders of Middle&s;ex, however, &s;eem to have been of a very different opinion from the com|mons; for they immediately and unanimou&s;ly reelect|ed him their repre&s;entative. This election was declar|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> void, and a new writ i&s;&s;ued. The freeholders &s;till per&s;evered in their former &s;entiments; and Mr. Wilkes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> elected a third time without oppo&s;ition. A gen|tleman indeed, of the name of Dingley, intended to have oppo&s;ed him; but the popular current ran &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">trong in favour of Mr. Wilkes, that he could not find a &s;ingle per&s;on to put him in nomination. This elec|tion was declared void, as well as the preceding; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the freeholders of Middle&s;ex and the hou&s;e of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">mmons &s;hould go on forever, the one in electing Mr. Wilkes, and the other in declaring his election invalid, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">el Lutterel, &s;on to lord Irnham, and a member of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">liament, was per&s;uaded to vacate his &s;eat by the acceptance of a nominal place, and to offer him&s;elf as a candidate. He did &s;o; and though he had only 296 votes,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> and Mr. Wilkes 1143, yet he was declared in the hou&s;e, by a great majority, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> be the legal member. The majority of the hou&s;e maintained that expul&s;ion nece&s;&s;arily implied an inca|pability of &s;itting afterwards. But mo&s;t of the prece|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ents brought forth were not to the purpo&s;e; as hap|pening either in times of barbarity, or of internal in|&s;urrections in the kingdom. It was urged by the mi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ority, that the power of the hou&s;e of commons has never gone beyond expul&s;ion; nor is it proper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;hould, except in ca&s;es of bribery and corruption. But if the
<PB N="294" REF="028963_0147_0FDD5F31BA5D0658">hou&s;e abu&s;es its power, in the execution of this privilege, by depriving the con&s;tituents of their power of reelect|ing the expelled member, there is not any remedy a|gain&s;t mini&s;terial oppre&s;&s;ion, if they can once prevail &s;o far as to procure a majority in favour of the expul|&s;ion of &s;uch members as may be obnoxious to them.</P>
<P>This vote of the hou&s;e of commons was con&s;idered as a fatal blow to the liberties of the people; at lea&s;t to the right of election, the mo&s;t vital and e&s;&s;ential part of tho&s;e liberties. This poured poi&s;on into the political wound, that rendered it perfectly incurable. The Middle&s;ex election may hitherto be regarded mere|ly as a common controverted election, in which none but Mr. Wilkes and his opponents were concerned. From this time forward it a&s;&s;umed a more dignified air, a more important a&s;pect. In&s;tead of a private, it be|came a national concern. A great part of the people took the alarm. They thought they fore&s;aw, in the de&s;truction of the rights of the freeholders of Middle|&s;ex, the utter ruin and &s;ubver&s;ion of their own. The con&s;equence was, that petitions fir&s;t, and remon&s;tranc|es afterwards poured in from the different counties and corporations in the kingdom. Many of the&s;e were of a very bold, and, as &s;ome thought, of a mo&s;t daring nature. They not only prayed for a di&s;&s;olution of par|liament, but they even denied the legality of the pre&s;|ent one, the validity of its acts, and the obligation of the people to obey them. In a word, they affected that the government was actually di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>The mini&s;try had now brought them&s;elves into a mu&s;t di&s;agreeable dilemma. They ought either not to have proceeded &s;o far,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770.</NOTE> or they ought to have gone farther. They ought either not to have furni&s;hed the people with a ju&s;t cau&s;e, nor even with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">lau&s;ible pretence, for pre&s;enting &s;uch remon|&s;trances, or they ought to have puni&s;hed them for dar|ing
<PB N="295" REF="028963_0147_0FDD5F31BA5D0658">to pre&s;ent them. This, however, they did not think it prudent, nor perhaps even &s;afe, to attempt.</P>
<P>Some of the freeholders of Middle&s;ex even attempt|ed to carry their &s;peculative principles into practice. They refu&s;ed to pay the land tax; and the matter was brought to a trial. But the jury determined, that they were obliged to pay it; and, in &s;o doing, they di&s;cover|ed more firmne&s;s and fortitude than their rulers. This, however, was but a poor compen&s;ation for the want of courage and con&s;i&s;tency in the mini&s;ters. It was like endeavouring to &s;upport a mighty arch with a feeble <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ttre&s;s, when the key &s;tone, that held it together, was removed.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of this year a very important act was pa&s;&s;ed for regulating the proceedings of the hou&s;e of commons in controverted elections.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770.</NOTE> The&s;e u&s;ed formerly to be determined by the hou&s;e at large, and by a majority of votes, &s;o that they were con&s;idered merely as party matters, and the &s;tronge&s;t party, which was always that of the mini&s;try, was &s;ure to carry the point, without paying the lea&s;t regard to the merits of the que&s;tion on either &s;ide. By the bill which was now pa&s;&s;ed, called the Grenville act, they were ordered for the future to be decided by a committee of thirteen members, cho&s;en by lot, and under the &s;acred obligation of an oath; and &s;ince the enacting of this law, no well grounded complaint has been made again&s;t the impartiality of the deci&s;ions.</P>
<P>Though the pre&s;ent mini&s;try was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been originally recommended to his maje&s;ty by lord Chatham, and to have been guided for &s;ome time, in all their mea&s;ures, by his advice, yet, as they had of late affected to &s;tand upon their own bottom, and neglected to con&s;ult him as u&s;ual, he entirely abandoned them, and re&s;igned his office as keeper of the privy &s;eal, which was be&s;towed on the

</ARGUMENT>
<P>GREAT Britain was thus rent by internal di&s;&s;en|tions, and factions, whil&s;t &s;ucceeding admin|i&s;trations, with equal weakne&s;s and ob&s;tinacy, endeav|oured to e&s;tabli&s;h parliamentary &s;upremacy over the colonies. Anxious to e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;y&s;tem, and at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ame time affraid to encounter oppo&s;ition effectively, they conceded enough to weaken their authority, and yet not enough to &s;atisfy the coloni&s;ts. And the&s;e cau&s;es had operated with redoubled force, upon every renewal of the di&s;pute.</P>
<P>The declaratory act, and the re&s;ervation of the duty upon tea, left the cau&s;e of contention in full force, but the former was only a claim on paper, and the latter
<PB N="300" REF="028963_0150_0FDDBE67B27FC7B8">might be evaded by refu&s;ing to purcha&s;e any tea, on which the parliamentary tax was impo&s;ed. The coloni&s;ts, therefore, conceiving that their commerce might be renewed, without e&s;tabli&s;hing any precedent, injurious to their liberties, relaxed in their a&s;&s;ociations, in every particular, except tea, and immediately recom|menced the importation of all other articles of mer|chandize. Britain might now have clo&s;ed the di&s;pute forever, and honourably receded, without a formal re|linqui&s;hment of her claims. Many hoped that the contention between the two countries was finally clo&s;ed. In all the provinces excepting Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, appear|ances &s;eemed to favour that opinion; but in that pro|vince, the unhappy quarrel which has been already men|tioned, between the people and the military force there &s;tationed, proved a fruitful &s;ource of complaint. The continuance of a board of commi&s;&s;ioners in Bo&s;ton, the con&s;tituting the governours and judges of the pro|vince independent of the people, were likewi&s;e con|&s;tant cau&s;es of irritation.</P>
<P>The only rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned by the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter for retaining the tea duty, was to &s;upport the authority of parliament; at the &s;ame time, he acknowledged it to be as anticommercial a tax, as any of tho&s;e that had been repealed upon that principle. The Ea&s;t India company, feeling the bad effects of the colonial &s;muggling trade, by the large quantity of tea which remained in their ware hou&s;es unfold, reque&s;ted the repeal of the three pence per pound in America, and offered, that on its being complied with, government &s;hould retain &s;ix pence in the pound on the exportation. Thus the company pre&s;ented the happie&s;t opportunity that could have been offered for honourably removing the cau&s;e of differ|ence with America. This afforded an opening for do|ing ju&s;tice without infringing the claims on either &s;ide. The mini&s;ter was reque&s;ted and intreated, by a gentle|man
<PB N="301" REF="028963_0150_0FDDBE67B27FC7B8">of great weight in the company, and a member of parliament, to embrace the opportunity; but it was ob|&s;tinately rejected.</P>
<P>New contrivances were &s;et on foot, to introduce the tea attended with the three penny duty, into all the colonies. Various intrigues and &s;olicitations were u&s;ed to induce the Ea&s;t India company to undertake this ra&s;h and fool|i&s;h bu&s;ine&s;s. It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> prote&s;ted again&s;t, as contrary to the principle of the company's monopoly; but the pow|er of the mini&s;try prevailed, and the in&s;ignificant duty of three pence per pound on tea, was doomed to be the fatal bane of contention between Great Britain and her colonies.</P>
<P>The Americans perceiving that the tax was thus like|ly to be enforced, whether they would or not, deter|mined to take every po&s;&s;ible method to prevent the tea from being landed, as well knowing that it would be im|po&s;&s;ible to hinder the &s;ale, &s;hould the commodity once be brought on &s;hore. For this purpo&s;e, the people a&s;&s;em|bled in great numbers, forcing tho&s;e to whom the tea was con&s;igned to re&s;ign their offices, and to promi&s;e &s;o|lemnly never to re&s;ume them; and committees were ap|pointed to examine the accounts of merchants, and make public te&s;ts, declaring &s;uch as would not take them, enemies to their country. And this was no empty menace, but pregnant with certain ruin to their property, and the gro&s;&s;e&s;t indignity to their per&s;ons. Nor was this behaviour confined to the colony of Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts Bay; the re&s;t of the provinces entered into the conte&s;t with the &s;ame warmth, and manife&s;ted the &s;ame re&s;olution to oppo&s;e this inva&s;ion of their rights.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this confu&s;ion, three &s;hips laden with tea, arrived in Bo&s;ton; but &s;o much were the captains alarmed at the di&s;po&s;ition which &s;eemed to prevail among the people, that they offered, providing they could obtain the proper di&s;charges from the tea con|&s;ignees,
<PB N="302" REF="028963_0151_0FDDBE692144DC68">cu&s;tom hou&s;e, and governour, to return to Britain without landing their cargoes. The parties concerned, however, though they dur&s;t not order the tea to be landed, refu&s;ed to grant the di&s;charges requir|ed. The &s;hips, therefore, would have been obliged to remain in the harbour; but the people, apprehen&s;ive that if they remained there, the tea would be landed in &s;mall quantities and di&s;po&s;ed of in &s;pite of every en|deavour to prevent it, re&s;olved to de&s;troy it at once. This re&s;olution was executed with equal &s;peed and &s;e|cre&s;y. The very evening after the above mentioned di&s;charges had been refu&s;ed, about &s;eventeen per&s;ons, dre&s;&s;ed like Mohawk Indians, boarded the &s;hips,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dec.</HI> 16.</NOTE> and threw into the &s;ea their whole car|goes, con&s;i&s;ting of 342 che&s;ts of tea; after which they retired, without making any farther di&s;|turbance, or doing any other damage. No tea was de|&s;troyed in other places, though the &s;ame &s;pirit was eve|ry where manife&s;ted. At Philadelphia, the pilots were enjoined not to conduct the ve&s;&s;els up the river; and at New York, though the governour cau&s;ed &s;ome tea to be landed, under the protection of a man of war, he was obliged to deliver it up to the cu&s;tody of the peo|ple to prevent its being &s;old.</P>
<P>The de&s;truction of the tea at Bo&s;ton, was the imme|diate prelude to the di&s;a&s;ters attending civil di&s;cord. Government finding them&s;elves every where in&s;ulted and de&s;pi&s;ed, re&s;olved to enforce their authority, by all po&s;&s;ible means; and as Bo&s;ton had been the principal &s;cene of the riots and outrages, it was determined to pun|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;h that town in an exemplary manner. Parliament was acquainted, by a me&s;&s;age from his maje&s;ty, with the undutiful behaviour of the city of Bo&s;ton,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1774, <HI>March</HI> 7.</NOTE> as well as of all the colonies, recom|mending at the &s;ame time, the mo&s;t vigor|ous and &s;pirited exertions to reduce them to obedience.
<PB N="303" REF="028963_0151_0FDDBE692144DC68">The parliament, in its addre&s;s, promi&s;ed a ready com|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">iance; and, indeed, the Americans &s;eemed now to have lo&s;t many of their parti&s;ans. It was propo&s;ed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y a fine on the town of Bo&s;ton, equal to the price of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e ten which had been de&s;troyed, and to &s;hut up its port by armed ve&s;&s;els until the refractory &s;pirit of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">habitants &s;hould be &s;ubdued; which, it was thought, mu&s;t quickly yield, as a total &s;top would thus be put to their trade. The bill was &s;trongly oppo&s;ed on the &s;ame grounds that the other had been; and it was pre|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cted, that, in&s;tead of having any tendency to recon|cile or &s;ubdue the Americans, it would infallibly exa&s;|perate them beyond any po&s;&s;ibility of reconciliation. The petitions again&s;t it, pre&s;ented by the colony's agent, pointed out the &s;ame con&s;equence in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, and in the mo&s;t po&s;itive manner declared that the Amer|icans never would &s;ubmit to it: but &s;uch was the in|&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tuation, attending every rank and degree of men, of more than one half of the nation, that it never was im|agined the Americans would dare to re&s;i&s;t the parent &s;tate openly, but would in the end &s;ubmit implicitly to her commands. In this confidence, a third bill was propo&s;ed for the impartial admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice on &s;uch per&s;ons as might be employed in the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of riots and tumults in the province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay. By this act it was provided, that &s;hould any per&s;ons act|ing in that capacity be indicted for murder, and not able to obtain a fair trial in the province, they might be &s;ent by the governour to England, or to &s;ome other colony, if nece&s;&s;ary, to be tried for the &s;uppo&s;ed crime.</P>
<P>The&s;e three bills having pa&s;&s;ed &s;o ea&s;ily, the mini&s;try propo&s;ed a fourth, relative to the government of Cana|da; which, it was &s;aid, had not yet been &s;ettled on any proper plan. By this bill the extent of that pro|vince was greatly enlarged; its affairs were put un|der

The council above mentioned were to be appointed by the crown; to be removable at its plea&s;ure; and to be inve&s;ted with every legi&s;lative power, excepting that of taxation.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner were the&s;e laws made known in America, than they cemented the union of the colonies almo&s;t beyond any po&s;&s;ibility of di&s;&s;olving it. The a&s;&s;embly of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay had pa&s;&s;ed a vote again&s;t the judges' accepting &s;alaries from the crown, and put the que&s;tion, Whether they would accept them as u&s;ual from the general a&s;&s;embly? Four an&s;wered in the af|firmative; but Peter Oliver, the chief ju&s;tice, refu&s;ed. A petition again&s;t him, and an accu&s;ation, were brought before the governour; but the latter refu&s;ed the accu&s;ation, and declined to interfere in the matter; but as they &s;till in&s;i&s;ted for ju&s;tice, again&s;t Mr. Oliver, the governour thought proper to put an end to the mat|ter by di&s;&s;olving the a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation of affairs, a new alarm was occa|&s;ioned by the news of the port bill, which had pa&s;&s;|ed both hou&s;es, on the 25th of March, and reached Bo&s;ton on the 15th of May. This had been totally unexpected, and was received with the mo&s;t ex|travagant expre&s;&s;ions of di&s;plea&s;ure, among the peo|ple; and whil&s;t the&s;e continued, the new governour,

He had been cho&s;en to this office on account of his being well acquainted in America, and generally agreeable to the people; but human wi&s;dom could not now point out a method by which the flame could be allayed. The fir&s;t act of his office as governour, was to remove the a&s;&s;embly to Salem, a town 17 miles di&s;tant, in con&s;equence of the late act.
<PB N="305" REF="028963_0152_0FDE10206DE724F8">When this was intimated to the a&s;&s;embly, they replied by reque&s;ting him to appoint a day of public humilia|tion, for deprecating the wrath of Heaven, but met with a refu&s;al. When met at Salem, they pa&s;&s;ed a re|&s;olution, declaring the nece&s;&s;ity of a general congre&s;s, compo&s;ed of delegates from all the provinces, in or|der to take the affairs of the colonies at large into con|&s;ideration; and five gentlemen, remarkable for their oppo&s;ition to the Briti&s;h mea&s;ures, were cho&s;en to re|pre&s;ent that of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay. This was the ba&s;is of the continental congre&s;s. They then proceeded with all expedition to draw up a declaration, containing a detail of the grievances they laboured under, and the nece&s;&s;ity of exerting them&s;elves again&s;t lawle&s;s power; they &s;et forth the di&s;regard &s;hown to their petitions, and the attempts of Great Britain to de&s;troy their ancient con&s;titution; and concluded with exhorting the inhab|itants of the colony to ob&s;truct, by every method in their power, &s;uch evil de&s;igns, recommending at the &s;ame time, a total renunciation of every thing import|ed from Great Britain, till a redre&s;s of grievances could be procured.</P>
<P>Intelligence of this declaration was carried to the governour, on the very day it was completed; on which he di&s;&s;olved the a&s;&s;embly. This was followed by an addre&s;s from the inhabitants of Salem in favour of tho&s;e of Bo&s;ton, and concluding with the&s;e remarka|ble words: "By &s;hutting up the port of Bo&s;ton, &s;ome imagine that the cour&s;e of trade might be turned hither, and to our benefit; but nature, in the forma|tion of our harbour, forbids our becoming rivals in commerce with that convenient mart; and were it otherwi&s;e, we mu&s;t be dead to every idea of ju&s;tice, lo&s;t to all feelings of humanity, could we indulge one thought to &s;eize on wealth, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ai&s;e our fortunes on the ruin of our &s;uffering neighbours."</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="028963_0153_0FDE102308E7A1F0">
It had been fondly hoped by the mini&s;terial party, that the advantages which other towns of the colony might derive from the annihilation of the trade of Bo&s;|ton, would make them readily acquie&s;ce in the mea&s;ure of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">utting up that port, and rather rejoice in it than otherwi&s;e; but the words of the addre&s;s above mentioned &s;eemed to preclude all hope of this kind; and &s;ub&s;equent tran&s;actions &s;oon manife&s;ted it to be totally vain. No &s;ooner did intelligence arrive of the remaining bills, pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;e&s;&s;ion of 1774, than the cau&s;e of Bo&s;ton became the cau&s;e of all the col|onies. The port bill had already occa&s;ioned violent commotions throughout them all. It had been repro|bated in provincial meetings, and re&s;i&s;tance even to the la&s;t had been recommended again&s;t &s;uch oppre&s;&s;ion. In Virginia, the fir&s;t of June, the day on which the port of Bo&s;ton was to be &s;hut up, was held a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a day of humiliation, and a public int<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ce&s;&s;ion in favour of America was enjoined. The &s;tyle of the prayer en|joined at this time was, that "God would give the people one heart and one mind, firmly to oppo&s;e every inva&s;ion of the American rights." The Virginians, however, did not content them&s;elves with acts of re|ligion. They recommended in the &s;tronge&s;t manner a general congre&s;s of all the colonies, as fully per&s;uad|ed that an attempt to tax any colony in an arbitrary manner was in reality an attack upon them all, and mu&s;t ultimately end in the ruin of them all.</P>
<P>The provinces of New York and Penn&s;ylvania, how|ever, were le&s;s &s;anguine than the re&s;t, being &s;o clo&s;ely connected in the way of trade with Great Britain, that the giving it up entirely, appeared a matter of the mo&s;t &s;erious magnitude, and not to be thought of but after every other method had failed. The intelligence of the remaining bills re&s;pecting Bo&s;ton, however, &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">read a fre&s;h alarm throughout the con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">inent, and fix|ed
<PB N="307" REF="028963_0153_0FDE102308E7A1F0">tho&s;e who had &s;eemed to be the mo&s;t wavering. The propo&s;al of giving up all commerical intercour&s;e with Britain was again propo&s;ed; contributions for the inhabitants of Bo&s;ton were rai&s;ed in every quarter; and they every day received addre&s;&s;es commending them for the heroic courage with which they &s;u&s;tained their calamity.</P>
<P>The Bo&s;tonians on their part were not wanting in their endeavours to promote the general cau&s;e. An agreement was framed, which, in imitation of former times, they called a Solemn League and Covenant. By this the &s;ub&s;cribers mo&s;t religiou&s;ly bound them|&s;elves to break off all communication with Britain af|ter the expiration of the month of Augu&s;t en&s;uing, until the obnoxious acts were repealed; at the &s;ame time they engaged neither to purcha&s;e nor u&s;e any goods imported after that time, and to renounce all connexion with tho&s;e who did, or who refu&s;ed to &s;ub|&s;cribe to this covenant; threatening to publi&s;h the names of the refractory; which at this time was a pun|i&s;hment by no means to be de&s;pi&s;ed. Agreements of a &s;imilar kind were almo&s;t in&s;tantaneou&s;ly entered into throughout all America. General Gage indeed at|tempted to counteract the covenant by a proclamation, wherein it was declared an illegal and traiterous combi|nation, threatening with the pains of law &s;uch as &s;ub|&s;cribed or countenanced it. But matters were too far gone for his proclamations to have any effect. The Americans retorted the charge of illegality on his own proclamation, and in&s;i&s;ted that the law allowed &s;ub|jects to meet in order to con&s;ider of their grievances, and a&s;&s;ociate for relief from oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Preparations were now made for holding the gener|al congre&s;s &s;o often propo&s;ed. Philadelphia, as being the mo&s;t central and con&s;iderable town, was pitched upon for the place of its meeting. The delegates, of
<PB N="308" REF="028963_0154_0FDE102469B36E28">whom it was to be compo&s;ed, were cho&s;en by the rep|re&s;entatives of each province, and were in number from two to &s;even for each colony, though no province had more than one vote. The fir&s;t congre&s;s which met at Philadelphia,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sept.</HI> 5.</NOTE> on the 5th of Sep|tember 1774, con&s;i&s;ted of 51 delegates; near|ly one half of whom were lawyers. Gentlemen of that profe&s;&s;ion had acquired the confidence of the in|habitants by their exertions in the common cau&s;e. The previous mea&s;ures in the re&s;pective provinces had been planned and carried into effect, more by lawyers than by any other order of men. The novelty and import|ance of the meeting excited an univer&s;al attention; and their tran&s;actions were &s;uch as could not tend but to render them re&s;pectable. They cho&s;e Peyton Ran|dolph their pre&s;ident, and Charles Thom&s;on their &s;ecre|tary. It was agreed, as one of the rules of their doing bu&s;ine&s;s, that no entry &s;hould be made in their journals of any propo&s;itions di&s;cu&s;&s;ed before them, to which they did not finally a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t act of congre&s;s was an approbation of the conduct of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, and an exhortation to continue in the &s;ame &s;pirit with which they had begun. Supplies for the &s;uffering inhabitants (whom the oper|ation of the port bill had reduced to great di&s;tre&s;s) were &s;trongly recommended; and it was declared, that in ca&s;e of attempts to enforce the obnoxious acts by arms, all America &s;hould join to a&s;&s;i&s;t the town of Bo&s;|ton; and, &s;hould the inhabitants be obliged, during the cour&s;e of ho&s;tilities, to remove farther up the country, the lo&s;&s;es they might &s;u&s;tain &s;hould be repaired at the public expen&s;e.</P>
<P>They next addre&s;&s;ed general Gage by letter; in which, having &s;tated the grievances of the people of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts colony, they informed him of the fixed and unalterable determination of all the other provin|ces
<PB N="309" REF="028963_0154_0FDE102469B36E28">to &s;upport their brethren and to oppo&s;e the Briti&s;h acts of parliament; that they them&s;elves were appoint|ed to watch over the liberties of America; and intreat|ed him to de&s;i&s;t from military operations, le&s;t &s;uch ho&s;|tilities might be brought on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> would fru&s;trate all hopes of reconciliation with the parent &s;tate.</P>
<P>The next &s;tep was to publi&s;h a declaration of their rights. The&s;e they &s;ummed up in the rights belong|ing to Engli&s;hmen; and particularly in&s;i&s;ted, that as their di&s;tance rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for them to be re|pre&s;ented in the Briti&s;h parliament, their provincial a&s;|&s;emblies, with the governour appointed by the king, con&s;tituted the only legi&s;lative power within each prov|ince. They then marked the line between the &s;uprem|acy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> parliament, and the independency of the colo|nial legi&s;latures, by provi&s;oes and re&s;trictions, expre&s;&s;ed in the following words: "But from the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e, and a regard to the mutual intere&s;ts of both countries, we cheerfully con&s;ent to the operation of &s;uch acts of the Briti&s;h parliament, as are <HI>bona fide</HI> re|&s;trained to the regulation of our external commerce, for the purpo&s;e of &s;ecuring the commerical advantages of the whole empire to the mother country, and the commerical benefits of its re&s;pective members, exclud|ing every idea of taxation, internal and external, for rai&s;ing a revenue on the &s;ubjects of America without their con&s;ent."</P>
<P>Doctor Ram&s;ay remarks, that "this was the very hinge of the controver&s;y. The ab&s;olute unlimited &s;u|premacy of the Briti&s;h parliament, both in legi&s;lation and taxation, was contended for on one &s;ide; while on the other, no farther authority was conceded than &s;uch a limited legi&s;lation, with regard to external commerce, as would combine the intere&s;t of the whole empire. In government, as well as in religion, there are my&s;te|ries, from the clo&s;e inve&s;tigation of which little advan|tage
<PB N="310" REF="028963_0155_0FDE102A68C76078">can be expected. From the unity of the empire it was nece&s;&s;ary, that &s;ome acts &s;hould extend over the whole. From the local &s;ituation of the colonies it was equally rea&s;onable that their legi&s;latures &s;hould at lea&s;t in &s;ome matters be independent. Where the &s;uprem|acy of the fir&s;t ended and the independency of the la&s;t began, was to the be&s;t informed a puzzling que&s;tion. Happy would it have been for both countries, had the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this doubtful point never been attempted."</P>
<P>They proceeded to reprobate the intention of each of the new acts of parliament; and in&s;i&s;ted on all the rights they had enumerated as being unalienable, and what none could deprive them of. The Canada act they particularly pointed out as being extremely ini|mical to the colonies, by who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance it had been conquered; and they termed it "An act for e&s;tabli&s;h|ing the Roman Catholic religion in Canada, aboli&s;hing the equitable &s;y&s;tem of Engli&s;h laws, and e&s;tabli&s;hing a tyranny there." They further declared in favour of a non importation and non con&s;umption of Briti&s;h goods, until the acts were repealed by which duties were impo&s;ed upon tea, coffee, wine, &s;ugar, and mo|la&s;&s;es, imported into America, as well as the Bo&s;ton port act, and the three others pa&s;&s;ed in the preceding &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament. The new regulations again&s;t the importation and con&s;umption of Briti&s;h commodi|ties were then drawn up with great &s;olemnity; and they concluded with returning the warme&s;t thanks to tho&s;e members of parliament who had, with &s;o much zeal, though without any &s;ucce&s;s, oppo&s;ed the obnox|ious acts of parliament.</P>
<P>Their next proceedings were to frame a petition to the king, a memorial to the Briti&s;h nation, an addre&s;s to the colonies, and another to the inhabitants of the province of Quebeck. They were all drawn up in a ma&s;terly manner, and ought to have impre&s;&s;ed the peo|ple
<PB N="311" REF="028963_0155_0FDE102A68C76078">of Britain with a more favourable idea of the A|mericans than they could at that time be induced to entertain. The petition to the king was as follows:</P>

<P>But though now expo&s;ed to unexpected and unnat|ural &s;cenes of di&s;tre&s;s by a contention with that na|tion, in who&s;e parental guidance on all important af|fairs, we have hitherto, with filial reverence, con&s;tantly tru&s;ted, and therefore can derive no in&s;truction in our pre&s;ent unhappy and perplexing circum&s;tances from a|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y former experience; yet we doubt not, the purity of our intention, and the integrity of our conduct, will ju&s;tify us at the grand tribunal, before which all man|kind mu&s;t &s;ubmit to judgment.</P>
<P>We a&s;k but for peace, liberty and &s;afety. We wi&s;h not a diminution of the prerogative, nor do we &s;olicit the grant of any new right in our favour. Your roy|al authority over us, and our connexion with Great Britain, we &s;hall always carefully and zealou&s;ly endeav|our to &s;upport and maintain.</P>
<P>Filled with &s;entiments of duty to your maje&s;ty, and of affection to our parent &s;tate, deeply impre&s;&s;ed by our education, and &s;trongly confirmed by our rea&s;on, and anxious to evince the &s;incerity of the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions, we pre&s;ent this petition only to obtain redre&s;s of griev|ances,
<PB N="317" REF="028963_0158_0FDE10435060FE40">and relief from fears and jealou&s;ies, occa&s;ioned by the &s;y&s;tem of &s;tatutes and regulations adopted &s;ince the clo&s;e of the late war, for rai&s;ing a revenue in A|merica; extending the powers of courts of admiralty and vice admiralty; trying per&s;ons in Great Britain for offences alleged to be committed in America; af|fecting the province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay; and alter|ing the government, and extending the limits of Que|beck; by the abolition of which &s;y&s;tem, the harmony between Great Britain and the&s;e colonies, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the happine&s;s of both, and &s;o ardently de&s;ired by the latter, and the u&s;ual intercour&s;e, will be immedi|ately re&s;tored.</P>
<P>In the magnanimity and ju&s;tice of your maje&s;ty and parliament we confide for a redre&s;s of our other griev|ances, tru&s;ting, that when the cau&s;es of our apprehen|&s;ions are removed, our future conduct will prove us not unworthy of the regard we have been accu&s;tomed, in our happier days, to enjoy.</P>
<P>For, appealing to that Being who &s;earches thorough|ly the hearts of his creatures, we &s;olemnly profe&s;s, that our councils have been influenced by no other motive than a dread of impending danger.</P>
<P>Permit us then, mo&s;t gracious &s;overeign, in the name of all your faithful people in America, with the utmo&s;t humility, to implore you, for the honour of Almighty God, who&s;e pure religion our enemies are undermin|ing; for your glory, which can be advanced only by rendering your &s;ubjects happy, and keeping them unit|ed; for the intere&s;ts of your family, depending on an adherence to the principles that enthroned it; for the &s;afety and welfare of your kingdoms and dominions, threatened with almo&s;t unavoidable dangers and di&s;|tre&s;&s;es&mdash;that your maje&s;ty, as the loving father of your whole people, connected by the &s;ame bonds of law, loyalty, faith and blood, though dwelling in various

<P>We, therefore, mo&s;t earne&s;tly be&s;eech your maje&s;ty, that your royal authority and interpo&s;ition may be u&s;ed for our relief; and that a gracious an&s;wer may be given to this petition.</P>
<P>That your maje&s;ty may enjoy every felicity through a long and glorious reign over loyal and happy &s;ubjects, and that your de&s;cendants may inherit your pro&s;perity and dominions till time &s;hall be no more, is, and al|ways will be, our &s;incere and fervent prayer.</P>
<P>All this time the di&s;po&s;ition of the people had cor|re&s;ponded with the warme&s;t wi&s;hes of congre&s;s. The fir&s;t of June had been kept as a fa&s;t, not only through|out Virginia, where it was fir&s;t propo&s;ed, but through the whole continent. Contributions for the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of Bo&s;ton had been rai&s;ed throughout America, and people of all ranks &s;eemed to be particularly touched with them. Even tho&s;e who &s;eemed to be mo&s;t likely to derive advantages from them, took no opportunity, as has been already in&s;tanced in the ca&s;e of Salem. The inhabitants of Marblehead al&s;o &s;howed a noble example of magnanimity in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. Though &s;ituated in the neighbourhood of Bo&s;ton, and mo&s;t likely to derive benefit from their di&s;tre&s;&s;es, they did not attempt to take any advantage, but generou&s;ly of|fered the u&s;e of their harbour to the Bo&s;tonians, as well as their wharfs and warehou&s;es, free of all ex|pen&s;e. In the mean time the Briti&s;h forces at Bo&s;ton were continually increa&s;ing in number, which greatly augmented the general jealou&s;y and di&s;affection; the country were ready to ri&s;e at a moment's warning; and the experiment was made by giving a fal&s;e alarm
<PB N="319" REF="028963_0159_0FDE104358D60C28">that the communication between the town and country was to be cut off, in order to reduce the former by famine to a compliance with the acts of parliament. On this intelligence, the country people a&s;&s;embled in great numbers, and could not be &s;atisfied till they had &s;ent me&s;&s;engers into the city to enquire into the truth of the report. The&s;e me&s;&s;engers were enjoined to inform the town's people, that if they &s;hould be &s;o pu&s;illan|imous as to make a &s;urrender of their liberties, the prov|ince would not think it&s;elf bound by &s;uch examples; and that Britain, by breaking their original charter, had annulled the contract &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between them, and left them to act as they thought proper.</P>
<P>The people in every other re&s;pect manife&s;ted their inflexible determination to adhere to the plan they had &s;o long followed. The new coun&s;ellors and judges were obliged to re&s;ign their offices, in order to pre&s;erve their lives and properties from the fury of the multi|tude. In &s;ome places they &s;hut up the avenues to the court hou&s;es; and, when required to make way for the judges, replied, that they knew of none but &s;uch as were appointed by the ancient u&s;age and cu&s;tom of the province. Every where they manife&s;ted the mo&s;t ar|dent de&s;ire of learning the art of war; and every indi|vidual who could bear arms, was mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous in pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uring them, and learning their exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>Matters at la&s;t proceeded to &s;uch an height, that General Gage thought proper to fortify the neck of land which joins the town of Bo&s;ton to the continent. This, though undoubtedly a prudent mea&s;ure in his &s;ituation, was exclaimed again&s;t by the Americans in the mo&s;t vehement manner; but the general, in&s;tead of giving ear to their remon&s;trances, deprived them of all power of acting again&s;t him&s;elf, by &s;eizing the pro|vincial powder, ammunition, and military &s;tores at Cambridge and Charle&s;town. This excited &s;uch in|dignation,
<PB N="320" REF="028963_0160_0FDE1044B3A275C8">that it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty the people could be re&s;trained from marching to Bo&s;ton, and attacking the troops. Even in the town it&s;elf, the company of cadets that u&s;ed to attend him di&s;banded them&s;elves, and returned the &s;tandard he had as u&s;ual pre&s;ented them with on his acce&s;&s;ion to the govern|ment. This was occa&s;ioned by his having deprived the celebrated patriot John Hancock, afterwards pre&s;ident of the congre&s;s, of his commi&s;&s;ion as colonel of the cadets. A &s;imilar in&s;tance happened of a provincial colonel having accepted a &s;eat in the new council; up|on which 24 officers of his regiment re&s;igned their com|mi&s;&s;ions in one day.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the proceedings of the governour occa&s;ioned the holding an a&s;&s;embly of delegates from the &s;everal towns and di&s;|tricts in the county of Suffolk,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sept.</HI> 9.</NOTE> of which Bo&s;ton is the county town. The purport of this was publickly to renounce all obedience to the late acts of parliament, and to form an engagement to indemnify &s;uch as &s;hould be pro&s;ecuted on that account; the members of the new council were declared violaters of the rights of their country; all ranks and degrees were exhorted to learn the u&s;e of arms; and the receivers of the public revenue were ordered not to deliver it into the trea&s;ury, but to retain it in their own hands till the con&s;titution &s;hould be re&s;tored, or a provincial congre&s;s di&s;po&s;e of it otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>A remon&s;trance again&s;t the fortifications on Bo&s;ton Neck,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sept.</HI> 12.</NOTE> was next prepared, and pre|&s;ented to the governour; in which, however, they &s;till declared their unwillingne&s;s to proceed to any ho&s;tile mea&s;ures; a&s;&s;erting only as u&s;ual, their firm de|termination not to &s;ubmit to the acts of parliament, they had already &s;o much complained of. The governour, to re&s;tore tranquillity, if po&s;&s;ible, called a general
<PB N="321" REF="028963_0160_0FDE1044B3A275C8">a&s;&s;embly; but &s;o many of the council had re&s;igned their &s;eats, that he was induced to countermand its &s;itting by proclamation. This mea&s;ure, however, was deem|ed illegal; the a&s;&s;embly met at Salem; and, after wait|ing a day for the governour, voted them&s;elves into a provincial congre&s;s, of which Mr. Hancock was cho&s;en pre&s;ident. A committee was in&s;tantly appointed, who waited on the governour with a remon&s;trance concerning the fortifications on Bo&s;ton Neck; but nothing of con|&s;equence took place, both parties mutually criminating each other. The winter was now coming on, and the governour, to avoid quartering the &s;oldiers upon the in|habitants, propo&s;ed to erect barracks for them; but the &s;electmen of Bo&s;ton compelled the workmen to de&s;i&s;t. Carpenters were &s;ent for to New York, but they were refu&s;ed; and it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty that he could procure winter lodgings for his troops. Nor was the difficulty le&s;s in procuring clothes; as the mer|chants of New York told him, that "they would never &s;upply any article for the benefit of men &s;ent as ene|mies to their country."</P>
<P>This di&s;po&s;ition, known to be almo&s;t univer&s;al throughout the continent, was in the highe&s;t degree &s;atisfactory to congre&s;s; they unanimou&s;ly approved of the Suffolk re&s;olutions,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sept.</HI> 17.</NOTE> and vot|ed that contributions &s;hould be rai&s;ed for the relief of their brethren at Bo&s;ton, as their occa&s;ions might require; and having accompli&s;hed the momen|tous bu&s;ine&s;s for which they met, they broke up the 26th of October; after appointing another meeting of congre&s;s, the 10th of May en&s;uing, unle&s;s grievances &s;hould be redre&s;&s;ed before that time.</P>
<P>Every one &s;aw that the en&s;uing &s;pring was to be the &s;ea&s;on of commencing ho&s;tilities, and the mo&s;t inde|fatigable diligence was u&s;ed by the colonies to be well provided again&s;t &s;uch a formidable enemy. A li&s;t of
<PB N="322" REF="028963_0161_0FDE104C0D2F8CA0">all the fencible men in each colony was made out, and e&s;pecially of tho&s;e who had &s;erved in the former war; of whom they had the &s;atisfaction to find that two thirds were &s;till alive and fit to bear arms. Magazines of arms were collected, and money was provided for the payment of troops. The governour in vain at|tempted to put a &s;top to the&s;e proceedings by pro|clamations; the fatal period was now arrived; and the more the &s;ervants of government attempted to re|pre&s;s the &s;pirit of the Americans, the more violent it ap|peared.</P>
<P>In the mean time the inhabitants of Bo&s;ton were re|duced to great di&s;tre&s;s. The Briti&s;h troops, now di&s;|tingui&s;hed by the name of the <HI>enemy,</HI> were ab&s;olutely in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it; the inhabitants were kept as pri&s;oners, and might be made accountable for the conduct of the whole colonies, and various mea&s;ures were contrived to relieve the latter from &s;uch a di&s;agreeable &s;ituation. Sometimes it was thought expedient to remove the in|habitants altogether; but this was impracticable with|out the governour's con&s;ent. It was then propo&s;ed to &s;et fire to the town at once, after valuing the hou&s;es and indemnifying the proprietors; but this being found equally impracticable, it was re&s;olved to wait &s;ome other opportunity, as the garri&s;on were not very num|erous, and not being &s;upplied with nece&s;&s;aries by the inhabitants, might &s;oon be obliged to leave the place. The friends of Briti&s;h government indeed attempted to do &s;omething in oppo&s;ition to the general voice of the people; but, after a few ineffectual meetings and re&s;olutions, they were utterly &s;ilenced, and obliged to yield to the &s;uperior number of their adver&s;aries.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the gloomy &s;ituation of affairs, the Americans had great expectations, as well from the petition to the king, as the addre&s;s to the inhabitants of Great Britain. The indifference, however, with
<PB N="323" REF="028963_0161_0FDE104C0D2F8CA0">which this addre&s;s was generally received, quickly con|vinced them, that nothing was to be hoped for from that quarter. This apparent indifference, &s;o contrary to the expectation of the colonies, had ari&s;en from va|rious cau&s;es. A great part of the people had always con&s;idered America as a country the property of Bri|tain, to who&s;e laws and protection &s;he had a claim; and that the mother country, on the other hand, had an equal title to demand from her colonies a rea&s;ona|ble quota towards defraying the expen&s;e of the empire in general. Their prejudices in favour of the omnip|otence of parliament, and their de&s;ire that America &s;hould bear a proportional &s;hare of the public expen&s;es, hindered them from viewing any other &s;ecurity in the colonial charters, to the inhabitants of America, than a bar again&s;t taxation, by the king alone. The greater part of the people had no ju&s;t conception of the grounds of the quarrel, nor acquaintance of the real &s;ituation of things in America. They were likewi&s;e farther bewildered in their opinions by the conduct of oppo&s;ition. They ob&s;erved that many of the members of both hou&s;es of parliament who &s;tood forward in favour of America, were the men, who, when in office, had been mo&s;t active in &s;upport of tho&s;e obnoxious acts of parliament which gave birth to the di&s;turb|ances in the colonies. The American conte&s;ts were no longer new. They had engaged the attention of parliament, with very little intermi&s;&s;ion, for a period of ten years. Mo&s;t of the &s;ubjects in di&s;pute were ex|hau&s;ted by endle&s;s altercations; and the pa&s;&s;ions ex|cited by them, however violent at fir&s;t, had now &s;ub|&s;ided, and been &s;ucceeded by that li&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s and lan|guor con&s;equent on violent agitations of the mind. The former non importation agreement had been di&s;|&s;olved, without producing any &s;erious con&s;equences, owing mo&s;t probably to the divi&s;ions occa&s;ioned by the
<PB N="324" REF="028963_0162_0FDE106D359F95B8">repeal of the &s;everal new taxes in 1767. Mo&s;t people, therefore flattered them&s;elves, that as things had &s;o fre|quently appeared at the verge of a rupture, without actually arriving at it, &s;ome means would &s;till be found for accommodating this di&s;pute; or, at wor&s;t, it was &s;uppo&s;ed the Americans them&s;elves would grow tired. An opinion was al&s;o circulated, with great in|du&s;try, that a &s;how of re&s;olution on the part of the Briti&s;h mini&s;try, if per&s;evered in for &s;ome time, would certainly put an end to the conte&s;t, which, it was &s;aid, had been wholly nouri&s;hed by former conce&s;&s;ions. The generality of the people, therefore, were inclined to leave the trial of the effects of per&s;everance and re&s;olu|tion to the mini&s;try, who valued them&s;elves on the&s;e qualities. Thus admini&s;tration, being little oppo&s;ed at home, was left at leizure to pro&s;ecute &s;uch mea&s;ures again&s;t America, as had either been already adopted, or were as yet in embryo.</P>
<P>The parliament at that time, had but one &s;e&s;&s;ion more to run before it would expire of cour&s;e. A pro|clamation for its di&s;&s;olution, was, however, i&s;&s;ued on the 30th of September, and the writs made returnable for a new one, on the 29th of November following. The proceedings of congre&s;s had not yet reached Eng|land; but it was thought the mini&s;try dreaded a non-importation agreement; and wi&s;hed to have the elec|tions over, apprehending that the news of this event might influence the trading and manufacturing towns to vote again&s;t the court party. In the city, the popu|lar party, carried every thing before them. Mr. Wilkes, was again elected for Middle&s;ex, as well as lord mayor of London; and the mini&s;try had now too much to ri&s;k, to give him any di&s;turbance. The &s;peech from the throne,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nov.</HI> 30.</NOTE> at the meeting of parliament, &s;et forth the conduct of the Americans, particularly the inhabitants of Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts
<PB N="325" REF="028963_0162_0FDE106D359F95B8">Bay, in the mo&s;t atrocious light; and a firm re&s;o|lution was announced of with&s;tanding to the utmo&s;t every attempt to oppo&s;e the &s;upreme legi&s;lative author|ity of Great Britain over all the dominions of the crown, the maintenance of which was held to be e&s;&s;en|tial to the welfare, &s;afety, and dignity of the empire in general.</P>
<P>An addre&s;s, in an&s;wer to the &s;peech, was propo&s;ed in the u&s;ual form, by the mini&s;ter; but the oppo&s;ite party in&s;i&s;ted, that a reque&s;t &s;hould be made to his maje&s;ty, for a production of the whole intelligence he had received from America, as well as the letters, or|ders, and in&s;tructions relative to that bu&s;ine&s;s. This amendment was oppo&s;ed by the mini&s;try, on the ground that addre&s;&s;es were merely complimentary; that there was not then time for entering into a full di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of American affairs; but that they would come before the hou&s;e in their due order. After a warm debate, the original addre&s;s was carried by a prodigious majority, no le&s;s than 264 to 73.</P>
<P>The debate in the hou&s;e of lords was warm and ve|hement, though the minority was but 13 to 63 on the divi&s;ion. The di&s;pute was, however, remarkable for a prote&s;t, being the fir&s;t mentioned in the Engli&s;h hi&s;to|ry upon an addre&s;s. It concluded thus: "But what|ever may be the mi&s;chievous de&s;igns, or the incon&s;ider|ate temerity, which leads others to this de&s;perate cour&s;e, we wi&s;h to be known as per&s;ons who have ever di&s;ap|proved of mea&s;ures &s;o pernicious in their pa&s;t effects and their future tendency, and who are not in ha&s;te, without inquiry or information, to commit our&s;elves in declarations which may precipitate our country into all the calamities of a civil war."</P>
<P>However it was, whether it proceeded from irre&s;olu|tion, a want of &s;y&s;tem, doubts of parliamentary &s;up|port, or a difference of opinion in the cabinet, there
<PB N="326" REF="028963_0163_0FDE106F07E656C0">was a &s;trange &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of American bu&s;ine&s;s previous to the Chri&s;tmas rece&s;s, and the mini&s;ter &s;eemed evi|dently to &s;hrink from all conte&s;t upon that &s;ubject. The national e&s;timates were entirely formed upon a peace e&s;tabli&s;hment. The land tax was continued at three &s;hillings in the pound; no vote of credit was re|quired; the army remained upon its former footing, and a reduction of 4000 &s;eamen took place, only 16,000 being demanded for the en&s;uing year.</P>
<P>The &s;trange incon&s;i&s;tency of admini&s;tration, with re&s;pect to American affairs, was &s;everely &s;crutinized by the oppo&s;ition. It was a&s;&s;erted, that the whole was a cheat, in order to delude the people into a war, render|ed doubly ruinous and di&s;graceful by a defective pre|paration; that the mini&s;ters ob&s;tinately re&s;olved not to make peace by any rea&s;onable political conce&s;&s;ion, nor war by any vigorous military arrangement; but, by fluctuating between both, deprived the nation of a po&s;&s;i|bility of deriving benefit from either. Far from &s;erv|ing the public, this delay of incurring timely charge would certainly aggravate the future expen&s;e, as they would a&s;&s;uredly feel in due time. That they were far from de&s;iring war; as little did they reli&s;h large peace e&s;tabli&s;hments: but if, again&s;t their will, war <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be carried on, common &s;en&s;e di&s;tated, that it ought to be carried on with effect; and that, if a peace e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, and even lower than a peace e&s;tabli&s;hment, was &s;ufficient to &s;upport a war, this afforded a demon&s;tra|tive proof, that the peace e&s;tabli&s;hment had been &s;hame|fully prodigal.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to this, the mini&s;ter of the naval depart|ment publicly a&s;&s;erted in the hou&s;e of lords, that he knew the low e&s;tabli&s;hment propo&s;ed would be fully &s;ufficient for reducing the colonies to obedience. He &s;poke with the greate&s;t contempt both of the power and the courage of the Americans. He held, that they
<PB N="327" REF="028963_0163_0FDE106F07E656C0">were not di&s;ciplined nor capable of di&s;cipline, and that, formed of &s;uch materials, and &s;o indi&s;po&s;ed to action, the numbers, of which &s;uch boa&s;ts had been made, would only add to the facility of their defeat.</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion, however, the mo&s;t wary &s;ilence was ob&s;erved by the mini&s;ters with regard to their de|&s;igns again&s;t the Americans; being, in all probability, affraid that they would meet with a violent oppo&s;ition from the mercantile intere&s;t; and in this they were not deceived. A general alarm had been &s;pread during the rece&s;s; the merchants of &s;everal towns had met and prepared petitions to parliament; and lord Chat|ham, though now broken with age and infirmities, once more appeared in the hou&s;e of lords, to te&s;tify his di&s;approbation of mini&s;terial mea&s;ures.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1775, <HI>Jan.</HI> 20.</NOTE> He made a motion for recalling the troops
from Bo&s;ton, and repre&s;ented the mea&s;ure not
as matter of choice, but of nece&s;&s;ity. An hour lo&s;t in allaying the pre&s;ent ferment might pro|duce years of calamity, as the &s;ituation of the inhab|itants and troops, with regard to one another, render|ed them continually liable to events which might cut off all po&s;&s;ibility of a reconciliation: whereas, &s;uch a conciliatory mea&s;ure on the part of Britain would re|move all jealou&s;y and apprehen&s;ion on the part of the colonies, and in&s;tantaneou&s;ly produce the happie&s;t ef|fects to both countries. He &s;everely reproved admin|i&s;tration for refu&s;ing to take the American affairs in|&s;tantly into con&s;ideration; for deluding and deceiving the people by mi&s;repre&s;entations of facts; per&s;uading them that Bo&s;ton &s;tood unconnected with the other colonies in the di&s;pute with Great Britain, and that quiet would be re&s;tored to that city by the appearance of a &s;ingle regiment, as had been unwarily a&s;&s;erted. After condemning, in the mo&s;t explicit manner, the whole &s;eries of mini&s;terial conduct with regard to A|merica,
<PB N="328" REF="028963_0164_0FDE107004001FC8">he is &s;aid to have concluded his &s;peech with the following words: "If the mini&s;ters thus per&s;evere in <HI>mi&s;advi&s;ing</HI> and <HI>mi&s;leading</HI> the king, I will not &s;ay that they can alienate the affections of his &s;ubjects from his crown; but I will affirm, that they will make the crown not worth his wearing!&mdash;I will not &s;ay that the king is betrayed, but I will pronounce that the kingdom is undone." Lord Chatham's motion was lo&s;t by a majority of 68 to 18; and, on this occa&s;ion, the duke of Cumberland, the king's brother, divided with the minority. Such a deci&s;ive victory, however, as it di&s;covered to the mini&s;ter the true di&s;po&s;ition of the new parliament, &s;o it was thought to have given him confidence to go farther in his plan of coercion than he would otherwi&s;e have ventured to have done.</P>
<P>The American papers, at lea&s;t &s;uch as the mini&s;ter cho&s;e at this time to produce, were now laid before the hou&s;e. A &s;eparate committee was propo&s;ed for con&s;idering the petitions of the merchants, and this committee was to begin its &s;ittings on the 27th of January, the day after that appointed for taking the American affairs into con&s;ideration. On this occa&s;ion the mo&s;t violent debates en&s;ued, in which the utmo&s;t a&s;perity of language was made u&s;e of, e&s;pecially on the part of oppo&s;ition. They &s;aid it was a pitiful &s;hift to defeat the petitions which they dur&s;t not openly reject. The que&s;tion, however, was carried by a majority of 197 to 81.</P>
<P>Thus were con&s;igned to the <HI>Committee of Oblivion,</HI> as it was named by the members in oppo&s;ition, the pe|titions from London, Bri&s;tol, Gla&s;gow, Norwich, Liverpool, Manche&s;ter, Birmingham, Woolverhampton, Dudley, &amp;c.</P>
<P>A petition was next pre&s;ented by Mr. Bollan, Dr. Franklin, and Mr. Lee, three American agents, &s;etting forth, that they were authorized by the American con|tinental
<PB N="329" REF="028963_0164_0FDE107004001FC8">congre&s;s to pre&s;ent a petition from the congre&s;s to the king, which petition his maje&s;ty had referred to that hou&s;e. They were enabled, they &s;aid, to throw great light upon the &s;ubject; and prayed to be heard at the bar in &s;upport of it. Their application had the &s;ame fate with the re&s;t, being treated with the utmo&s;t indifference and contempt. The motion for receiving the petition was rejected by a majority of 218 to 68.</P>
<P>Lord Chatham per&s;evered in the pro&s;ecution of his conciliatory &s;cheme with America, and accordingly brought into the hou&s;e of lords a bill entitled, "A provi&s;ional act for &s;ettling the troubles in America, and for a&s;&s;erting the &s;upreme legi&s;lative authority and &s;uperintending power of Great Britain over the colo|nies." By this bill, the holding of a congre&s;s in the en&s;uing month of May was allowed, for the double purpo&s;e of duly recognizing the &s;upreme legi&s;lative au|thority and &s;uperintending power of parliament over the colonies, and for making a free grant to the king, his heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, of a certain and perpetual revenue, &s;ubject to the di&s;po&s;ition of parliament, and applicable to the alleviation of the national debt; taking it for granted, that this free aid would bear an honour|able proportion to the great and flouri&s;hing &s;tate of the colonies, the nece&s;&s;ities of the mother country, and their obligations to her. On the&s;e conditions it re|&s;trained the powers of the admiralty courts to their ancient limits: and, without repealing, &s;u&s;pended for a limited time tho&s;e acts, or parts of acts, which had been complained of in the petition from the continen|tal congre&s;s. It placed the judges upon the &s;ame foot|ing, as to the holding of their &s;alaries and offices, with tho&s;e of England; and &s;ecured to the colonies all the privileges, franchi&s;es, and immunities granted by their &s;everal charters and con&s;titutions. This propo&s;al was treated with the utmo&s;t indignity and contempt; not
<PB N="330" REF="028963_0165_0FDE107194A6E938">being allowed even to lie upon the table. On this oc|ca&s;ion, as on a former, the duke of Cumberland divided with the minority.</P>
<P>The mea&s;ures now propo&s;ed by lord North were entirely of a coercive kind.
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Feb.</HI> 2.</NOTE> A greater force was to be &s;ent to America, and a tempo|rary act pa&s;&s;ed to put a &s;top to all the foreign trade of the New England colonies, particularly the fi&s;hery on the banks of Newfoundland, until they returned to their duty. An addre&s;s to his maje&s;ty was at the &s;ame time moved for, to "be&s;eech him to take the mo&s;t ef|fectual mea&s;ures, to enforce due obedience to the laws and authority of the &s;upreme legi&s;lature."</P>
<P>Unfortunately for the peace of both countries, the parliament of Great Britain believed that the claims of the coloni&s;ts amounted to ab&s;olute independence, un|der the &s;pecious &s;hew of a redre&s;s of grievances. On the other hand, the coloni&s;ts were confident that Britain harboured de&s;igns not only ho&s;tile to their intere&s;ts, but that it was re&s;olved to introduce arbitrary government. Probably neither of the&s;e opinions were true in their ut|mo&s;t extent; but matters had now proceeded &s;o far, that every idea of reconciliation or friend&s;hip with Bri|tain was lo&s;t. The mini&s;try, unhappily, li&s;tened for information only to tho&s;e who&s;e intere&s;t it was to de|ceive them; &s;uch as governours, judges, revenue offi|cers, and other &s;ervants of government; the&s;e men fancied that palatable information would prove the way to farther promotion; and tho&s;e who&s;e integrity re|&s;trained them from &s;tooping to &s;uch meanne&s;s, were &s;o warped by prejudice, that their information had an ef|fect equally hurtful as that of the former.</P>
<P>In the debates on the mea&s;ures propo&s;ed by the min|i&s;ter, all the arguments which had been u&s;ed on form|er occa&s;ions by the members in oppo&s;ition were now collected and urged with the utmo&s;t vehemence. The
<PB N="331" REF="028963_0165_0FDE107194A6E938">dangers that would attend a war with America, were pointed out; and the interference of foreign nations was foretold. The mini&s;try did not deny the danger, but &s;aid, "it mu&s;t be encountered; that every day's delay increa&s;ed the evil, and that it would be ba&s;e and cow|ardly to put off for the pre&s;ent, an unavoidable conte&s;t, which mu&s;t fall with accumulated weight on the heads of their po&s;terity. The danger of the foreign interfer|ence was denied; the very idea of it was treated as the creature of imagination, and it was &s;aid, that an ap|pearance of vigorous mea&s;ures, with a farther rein|forcement of troops, would be &s;ufficient to quell the di&s;|turbances: and it was added, that the friends of gov|ernment, were &s;trong and numerous, and only waited for proper &s;upplies, and favourable circum&s;tances, to declare them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The mini&s;ter carried all his plans by great majorities, but not without long and warm debates, and &s;everal prote&s;ts in the hou&s;e of lords. At length, on the 9th of February, 1775, a joint addre&s;s, from both hou&s;es, was pre&s;ented to his maje&s;ty in which, "they returned thanks for the communication of the papers relative to the &s;tate of the Briti&s;h colonies in America, and gave it as their opinion, that a rebellion actually exi&s;ted in the province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and be&s;ought his maje&s;ty, that he would take the mo&s;t effectual mea&s;ures to en|force due obedience to the laws and authority of the &s;u|preme legi&s;lature, and begged in the mo&s;t &s;olemn man|ner to a&s;&s;ure his maje&s;ty, that it was their fixed re&s;olu|tion, at the hazard of their lives and properties, to &s;tand by his maje&s;ty again&s;t all rebellious attempts, in the maintenance of the ju&s;t rights of his maje&s;ty and the two hou&s;es of parliament."</P>
<P>The lords, Richmond, Craven, Archer, Abergaveny, Rockingham, Wycombe, Courtenay, Torrington, Pon|&s;onby, Cholmondeley, Abingdon, Rutland, Camden,
<PB N="332" REF="028963_0166_0FDE101E4C307BC0"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, Stanhop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, Scarborough, Fitzwilliam and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ankerville, prote&s;ted again&s;t this addre&s;s, "as found|ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n no proper parliamentary information, being in|troduced by refu&s;ing to &s;uffer the pre&s;entation of peti|titions again&s;t it, (though it be the undoubted right of the &s;ubjects to pre&s;ent the &s;ame) as following the re|jection of every mode of reconciliation&mdash;as holding out no &s;ub&s;tantial offer of redre&s;s of grievances, and as promi&s;ing &s;upport to tho&s;e mini&s;ters who had inflamed America, and gro&s;sly mi&s;conducted the affairs of Great Britain."</P>
<P>Thus the mini&s;try, having proved ultimately victori|ous, no farther ob&s;tacle remained to the entering upon deci&s;ive mea&s;ures with regard to America. In an&s;wer to the addre&s;s, a me&s;&s;age was &s;ent from the throne, de|manding an augmentation of the forces by &s;ea and land. This being referred to the u&s;ual committee of &s;upply, a project was next formed of laying farther re&s;trictions on the province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, it being deemed ab&s;urd to &s;end a military force, without making pro|per coercive laws, of which the military were to en|force the execution. For this purpo&s;e the mini&s;ter de|clared he would make choice of a puni&s;hment &s;o uni|ver&s;al, that all ranks and degrees of men could not but be affected by it, which, of cour&s;e, he &s;uppo&s;ed, would pro|duce obedience to the former laws. A bill was therefore brought into the hou&s;e of com|mons,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Feb.</HI> 10.</NOTE> to re&s;train the trade and commerce of the provinces of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay and New Hamp|&s;hire, the colonies of Connecticut, and Rhode I&s;land and Providence Plantations in North America, to Great Britain, Ireland, and the Briti&s;h I&s;lands in the We&s;t Indies; and to prohibit &s;uch colonies and provinces from carrying on any fi&s;hery on the banks of New|foundland, or other places therein to be mentioned, under certain conditions, and for a limited time. That the
<PB N="333" REF="028963_0167_0FDE107807DCF080">extreme &s;everity of this act, however, might be allevi|ated by &s;uch provi&s;ions as would not de&s;troy its main object, the mini&s;ter &s;aid he would only propo&s;e it as temporary, to continue either to the end of the year, or the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament; and he would al&s;o propo&s;e, that particular per&s;ons might be excepted, up|on their obtaining certificates from the governour of the province in which they re&s;ided, of their good be|haviour; or upon their &s;ub&s;cribing a te&s;t, acknowledg|ing the rights of parliament. Every argument which wit or ingenuity could &s;ugge&s;t was urged again&s;t this bill, by the minority. Petitions were pre&s;ented and heard from the London merchants and the &s;ociety of Friends, repre&s;enting the cruelty and impolicy of the act, the nature and extent of the fi&s;hery, and the trade of New England, at different periods. [See New Eng|land, p. 165, &amp;c.] The marquis of Rockingham, in his &s;peech again&s;t the bill, entered into a very minute de|tail of the American trade, and took a comparative view of that of New England at different periods. In the year 1704, he &s;hewed that the whole amount of the exports to New England was only about 70,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> annually; that in 1754, it had increa&s;ed to 180,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> and in the &s;ucceeding ten years to 400,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> and that in the la&s;t ten years it had been nearly doubled. He concluded his &s;peech, by fortelling, "that an u&s;eful and con&s;titutional agreement in &s;entiments, and coali|tion of intere&s;ts, could never take place between them and the mother country, unle&s;s the former mea&s;ures, preceding the laying on of any duties on the Americans, were recurred to and adopted."</P>
<P>The New England re&s;training act, having pa&s;&s;ed and received the royal a&s;&s;ent, was accompanied with a de|mand of two thou&s;and additional &s;eamen, and four thou&s;and three hundred and eighty three land forces; and the la&s;t demand was followed by an explanation
<PB N="334" REF="028963_0168_0FDE101D29D32B28">from the mini&s;ter, that the force at Bo&s;ton would be augmented to ten thou&s;and men. The&s;e propo&s;als drew forth the fierce&s;t wrath of oppo&s;ition; the incon|&s;i&s;tency, folly, and cruelty of mini&s;ters re&s;ounded through the hou&s;e. But whil&s;t both parties were ex|hau&s;ting them&s;elves in fruitle&s;s debates, lord North &s;urprized the whole nation by his conciliatory motion, afterwards &s;tyled his <HI>Olive Branch.</HI> By this it was propo&s;ed, that when the governour, council, and a&s;&s;em|bly of any province, or the general court, &s;hould pro|po&s;e to make provi&s;ion according to their re&s;pective conditions, circum&s;tances, and &s;ituations, for contrib|uting their proportion to the common defence, &s;uch proportion to be rai&s;ed under the authority of the gen|eral court, or general a&s;&s;embly of &s;uch province or col|ony, and di&s;po&s;able by parliament; and &s;hall engage to make provi&s;ion al&s;o for the &s;upport of the civil govern|ment, and the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice in &s;uch province or colony, it would be proper, if &s;uch propo&s;al &s;hould be approved of by his maje&s;ty in parliament, and for &s;o long as &s;uch provi&s;ion &s;hall be made accordingly, to for|bear, in re&s;pect of &s;uch province or colony, to levy a|ny Suties, tax, or a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment, except only &s;uch duties as it may be expedient to impo&s;e for the regulation of commerce; the net produce of the duties la&s;t men|tioned to be carried to the account of &s;uch province, colony, or plantation re&s;pectively.</P>
<P>Such a propo&s;ition from the mini&s;ter involved him in the mo&s;t violent conte&s;ts, even with tho&s;e of his own party. However, he &s;oon convinced the mal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">con|tents, that the appearances of lenity and conce&s;&s;ion con|tained in his conciliatory motion, were by no means in|con&s;i&s;tent with the mo&s;t rigid mea&s;ures; nay, &s;o well did he &s;ucceed in the explanation of his own propo&s;al, that he acknowledged he had no expectation of its be|ing well received by the generality of the Americans;
<PB N="335" REF="028963_0168_0FDE101D29D32B28">but that, if it did no good there, it would do good in Britain: It would unite the people, by holding out to them a di&s;tinct object of revenue; and as it united Britain, it would di&s;unite America: That whatever province came fir&s;t to make a dutiful offer, would be kindly and gently treated; and if only one province accepted the offer, the whole confederacy would be broken.</P>
<P>By the members in oppo&s;ition, this bill was reprobat|ed in the mo&s;t violent manner. It was remarked that hitherto it had been con&s;tantly denied that they had a|ny conte&s;t about an American revenue; that the whole had been a di&s;pute about obedience to trade laws, and the general legi&s;tative authority of parliament; but now mini&s;ters &s;uddenly changed their language, and propo&s;ed to intere&s;t the nation, con&s;ole the manufac|turers, and animate the &s;oldiery, by per&s;uading them that it is not a conte&s;t for empty honour, but for the acqui&s;ition of a &s;ub&s;tantial revenue. It was &s;aid that the Americans would be as effectually taxed, without their con&s;ent, by being compelled to pay a gro&s;s &s;um, as by an aggregate of &s;mall duties to the &s;ame amount. That this &s;cheme of taxation exceeded in oppre&s;&s;ion any that the rapacity of mankind had hitherto devi&s;ed. In other ca&s;es, a &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ecifie &s;um was demanded, and the people might rea&s;onably pre&s;ume that the remainder was their own; but here, they were wholly in the dark as to the extent of the demand. All their eloquence, however, was by no means &s;ufficient to carry the point even here, when the mini&s;ter had been de&s;erted by &s;ome of his &s;taunche&s;t friends. The bill was pa&s;&s;ed by a majority of 274 to 88.</P>
<P>This bill was followed by another, &s;eemingly of a contrary tendency, being a &s;upplement to the New England Fi&s;hery Bill, and included the colonies of New Jer&s;ey, Penn&s;ylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and South
<PB N="335" REF="028963_0169_0FDE107DA4637DA0">Carolina. No debate of any con&s;equence en&s;ued on this &s;ubject; but the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of another petition from the We&s;t India planters, proved the means of ren|dering the importance of the&s;e i&s;lands, and their de|pendence on North America, more generally under|&s;tood than before this time. From documents now produced, it appeared, that the capital in the&s;e i&s;lands, con&s;i&s;ting of cultivated lands, buildings, negroes, and &s;tock of all kinds, did not amount to le&s;s than &s;ixty millions &s;terling. Their exports of late years to Great Britain Lad run to about 190,000 hog&s;heads and pun|cheons of &s;ugar and rum annually; amounting in weight to 95,000 tons, and in value about four millions; be&s;ides a great number of &s;maller articles, as well as their immen&s;e export to North America. So rapid was the improvement of the&s;e i&s;lands, that within a few years, their export of &s;ugar to Britain had been increa&s;ed by 40,000 hog&s;heads annually, amounting to near 800,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> in value; and it &s;eemed probable, that no le&s;s than thirty millions of We&s;t India property be|longed to people in Britain; and that the revenue gain|ed above 700,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> annually upon the We&s;t India trade, exclu&s;ive of its eventual and circuitous products, and of the African trade. It was al&s;o fully &s;hown, that this immen&s;e capital and trade, as well as the African, neither of which could &s;ub&s;i&s;t without the other, were, both from nature and circum&s;tance, totally dependent on North America.</P>
<P>This petition, as well as another from Waterford in Ireland, produced no good con&s;equences. The mini&s;|terial plan was unalterably determined. Conciliatory motions were propo&s;ed by Mr. Burke and Mr. Hartley; but, whatever ingenuity might be di&s;played in the de|vi&s;ing and framing the&s;e motions, very little regard was paid to them by admini&s;tration. The only thing re|markable was the immen&s;e value of North America
<PB N="337" REF="028963_0169_0FDE107DA4637DA0">to Britain, as appeared from Mr. Barke's comparative view of the trade of Britain at different periods. From thence it was &s;hown, that in 1704, the exports to North Ameri|ca, the We&s;t Indies, and Africa, amounted only to 569,930<ABBR>l.</ABBR> That in the year 1772, at an average of &s;everal years before and after the exports to the &s;ame places, including tho&s;e from Scotland, (which, in the year 1704, had no exi&s;tence) amounted to no le&s;s than 6,024,171<ABBR>l.</ABBR> being in the proportion of nearly eleven to one. He al&s;o &s;hewed, that the whole ex|port trade of England, including that of the colonies, amounted, at the fir&s;t period of 1704, only to 6,509,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> Thus, the trade to the colonies alone was, at the latter period, within le&s;s than half a mil|lion of being equal to what Britain carried on at the beginning of the pre&s;ent century with the whole world. And, &s;tating the whole export trade of Britain at pre&s;ent at &s;ixteen millions, that to the colo|nies, which in the fir&s;t period con&s;tituted but one twelfth of the whole, was now very con&s;iderably more than one third.</P>
<P>However a&s;toni&s;hing this general increa&s;e of the whole colonies may appear, the growth of the prov|ince of Penn&s;ylvania was &s;till more extraordinary. In the year 1704, the whole exports to that colony amounted only to 11,459<ABBR>l.</ABBR> and in 1772 they were ri&s;en to 507,509<ABBR>l.</ABBR> being nearly fifty times the original demand, and almo&s;t equal to the whole colony export at the fir&s;t period.</P>
<P>Towards the clo&s;e of the &s;e&s;&s;ion a memorial was pre&s;ented to the hou&s;e of commons, and another to the hou&s;e of peers, from the a&s;&s;embly of New York, and both were rejected, upon the principle that they claimed to them&s;elves rights derogatory to, and incon|&s;i&s;tent with, the legi&s;lative authority of parliament. Memorials from the Briti&s;h inhabitants of Quebeck<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="338" REF="028963_0170_0FDE107F02950E78">pre&s;ented by lord Camden, and another from the in|habitants of Quebeck at large, were likewi&s;e rejected. The only remarkable circum&s;tances attending the&s;e, were the two royal brothers voting in the minority, and the animated &s;peech of lord Effingham, in the up|per hou&s;e, in favour of the claims of America, when he declared his re&s;ignation of the military command he held.</P>
<P>The &s;e&s;&s;ion concluded with the pa&s;&s;ing the money bills in the u&s;ual form. The &s;peaker, in his addre&s;s to the king, &s;tated the heavine&s;s of the grants, which, however, had been readily complied with, on account of the particular exigence of the times; at the &s;ame time a&s;&s;uring his maje&s;ty, that &s;hould the Americans per&s;i&s;t in their re&s;olutions, and thus render it nece&s;&s;ary to draw the &s;word, the commons would do every thing in their power to &s;upport the dignity of the Briti&s;h legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>Doctor Franklin laboured hard to prevent the breach from becoming irreparable, and in union with Dr. Fothergill and Mr. David Barclay, two Engli&s;h gentle|men, highly e&s;teemed by the Briti&s;h mini&s;try, candidly &s;tated the outlines of a compact which he &s;uppo&s;ed would procure a durable union of the two countries; but his well meant endeavours proved abortive, and in the mean time he was abu&s;ed as the fomenter of tho&s;e di&s;turbances which he was anxiou&s;ly endeavouring to prevent. That the mini&s;try might have &s;ome opening to proceed upon, and &s;ome &s;alvo for their per&s;onal hon|our, he was di&s;po&s;ed to engage, that pecuniary com|pen&s;ation &s;hould be made for the tea de&s;troyed; but he would not give up e&s;&s;ential liberty, for the purpo&s;e of procuring temporary &s;afety. Dr. Franklin finding the mini&s;try bent on war, unle&s;s the coloni&s;ts would con&s;ent to hold their rights, liberties and charters as the di&s;cretion of a Briti&s;h parliament, and well know|ing
<PB N="339" REF="028963_0170_0FDE107F02950E78">that his countrymen would hazard every thing, rath|er than con&s;ent to terms &s;o degrading, as well as &s;o incon|&s;i&s;tent with the &s;pirit of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, he quit|ted Great Britain in March 1775, and returned to Phi|ladelphia; where he joined his countrymen, and exert|ed his great abilities in conducting them through a war which was now unavoidable.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I MENTIONED it ye&s;terday to your excellency as my opin|ion, that excluding the people of the colonies from all &s;hare in the choice of the grand council, would probably give extreme di&s;&s;atisfaction, as well as the taxing them by an act of parliament, where they have no repre&s;entative. In matters of general con|cern to the people and e&s;pecially where burdens are to be laid upon them, it is of u&s;e to con&s;ider, as well what they will be apt to think and &s;ay, as what they ought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> think; I &s;hall therefore, as your excellency requires it of me, briefly mention what of ei|ther kind occurs to me on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, they will &s;ay, and perhaps with ju&s;tice, that the body of the people in the colonies are as loyal and as firmly attached to the pre&s;ent con&s;titution and reigning family, as any &s;ubjects in the king's dominions:</P>
<P>That there is no rea&s;on to doubt the readine&s;s and willingne&s;s of the repre&s;entatives they may choo&s;e, to grant from time to time &s;uch &s;upplies for the defence of the country as &s;hall be judged nece&s;&s;ary, &s;o far as their abilities will allow:</P>
<P>That the people in the colonies, who are to feel the immediate mi&s;chiefs of inva&s;ion and conque&s;t by an enemy, in the lo&s;s of their e&s;tates, lives and liberties are likely to be better judges of the quantity of forces nece&s;&s;ary to be rai&s;ed and maintained, forts to be built and &s;upported, and of their own abilities to bear the ex|pen&s;e, than the parliament of England at &s;o great a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>That governours often come to the colonies merely to make fortunes, with which they intend to return to Britain; are not always men of the be&s;t abilities or integrity; have many of them no e&s;tates here, nor any natural connexions with us, that &s;hould make them heartily concerned for our welfare; and might po&s;&s;i|bly be fond of rai&s;ing and keeping up more forces than nece&s;&s;ary from the profits accruing to them&s;elves, and to make provi&s;ion for their friends and dependants:</P>
<P>That the coun&s;ellors in mo&s;t of the colonies being appointed by the crown, on the recommendation of governours, are often
<PB N="342" REF="028963_0172_0FDE1082062DBDC8">of &s;mall e&s;tates, frequently dependent on the governours for of|fice, and therefore too much under influence:</P>
<P>That there is, therefore, great rea&s;on to be jealous of a power in &s;uch governours and councils, to rai&s;e &s;uch &s;ums as they &s;hall judge nece&s;&s;ary, by draft on the lords of the trea&s;ury, to be af|terward &s;aid on the colonies by act of parliament, and paid by the people here; &s;ince they might abu&s;e it, by projecting u&s;ele&s;s expeditions, hara&s;ling the people, and taking them from their la|bours to execute &s;uch projects, merely to create offices and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and gratify their dependants and divide profits:</P>
<P>That the parliament o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> England is at a great di&s;tance, &s;ubject to be mi&s;informed and mi&s;led by &s;uch governours and councils, who&s;e united intere&s;ts might probably &s;ecure them again&s;t the effect of any complaint from hence:</P>
<P>That it is &s;uppo&s;ed to be an undoubted right of <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> not to be taxed but by their own con&s;ent given through their repre&s;entatives:</P>
<P>That the colonies have no repre&s;entatives in parliament:</P>
<P>That to propo&s;e taxing them by parliament, and refu&s;e them the liberty of choo&s;ing a repre&s;entative council, to meet in the colonies, and con&s;ider and judge of the nece&s;&s;ity of any general tax, and the quantum, &s;hows a &s;u&s;picion of their loyalty to the crown, or of their regard for their country, or of their common &s;en&s;e and under&s;tanding, which they have not de&s;erved:</P>
<P>That compelling the colonies to pay money without their con&s;ent, would be rather like rai&s;ing contributions in an enemy's country, than taxing <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> for their own public benefit:</P>
<P>That it would be treating them as a conquered people, and not as true Briti&s;h &s;ubjects:</P>
<P>That a tax laid by the repre&s;entatives of the colonies might ea&s;ily be le&s;&s;ened, as the occa&s;ions &s;hould le&s;&s;en; but being once laid by parliament, under the influence of the repre&s;entations made by governours, would probably be kept up, and continued for the benefit of governours, to the grievous burden and di&s;|couragement of the colonies, and prevention of their growth and increa&s;e:</P>
<P>That a power in governours to march the inhabitants from one end of the Briti&s;h and French colonies to the other, being a country of at lea&s;t 1,500 &s;quare miles, without the approbation or con&s;ent of their repre&s;entatives fir&s;t obtained, might occa&s;ion expeditions grievous and ruinous to the people, and would put them upon a footing with the &s;ubjects of France in Canada, that now groan under &s;uch oppre&s;&s;ion from their governour, who, for two years pa&s;t, has harra&s;&s;ed them with long and de&s;tructive marches to the Ohio:</P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="028963_0172_0FDE1082062DBDC8">
That, if the colonies in a body may be well governed by gov|ernours and councils appointed by the crown without repre&s;ent|atives, particular colonies may as well, or better, be &s;o govern|ed: A tax may be laid on them all by act of parliament for &s;up|port of government, and their a&s;&s;emblies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;mi&s;&s;ed as an u&s;e|le&s;s part of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>That the powers propo&s;ed by the <HI>Albany</HI> plan of union, to be ve&s;ted in a grand repre&s;entative council of the people, even with regard to military matters, are not &s;o great as tho&s;e the colonies of <HI>Rhode I&s;land</HI> and <HI>Connecticut</HI> are entru&s;ted with by their charter, and have never abu&s;ed: For by this plan, the pre&s;ident general is appointed by the crown, and controls all by his negative; but in the&s;e governments, the people choo&s;e the governour, and yet allow him no negative:</P>
<P>That the Briti&s;h colonies bordering on the French, are prop|erly frontiers of the Briti&s;h empire; and the frontiers of an em|pire are properly defended at the joint expen&s;e of the body of the people in &s;uch empire. It would now be thought hard, by act of parliament, to oblige the cinque ports, or &s;ea coa&s;ts of Britain, to maintain the whole navy, becau&s;e they are more im|mediately defended by it; not allowing them at the &s;ame time a vote in choo&s;ing the members of parliament: And if the fron|tiers in America mu&s;t bear the expen&s;e of their own defence, it &s;eems hard to allow them no &s;hare in voting the money, judg|ing of the nece&s;&s;ity and &s;um, or advi&s;ing the mea&s;ures:</P>
<P>That be&s;ides the taxes nece&s;&s;ary for the defence of the fron|tiers, the colonies pay yearly great &s;ums to the mother coun|try unnoticed; for taxes paid in Britain, by the landholder or artificer, mu&s;t enter into and increa&s;e the price of the produce of land, and of manufactures made of it; and great part of this is paid by con&s;umers in the colonies, who thereby pay a con&s;ider|able part of the Briti&s;h taxes.</P>
<P>We are re&s;trained in our trade with foreign nations; and where we could be &s;upplied with any manufacture cheaper from them, but mu&s;t buy the &s;ame dearer from Britain, the difference of price is a clear tax to Britain. We are obliged to carry great part of our produce directly to Britain; and wherein the duties there laid upon it le&s;&s;en its price to the planter, or it &s;ells for le&s;s than it would in foreign markets, the difference is a tax paid to Britain.</P>
<P>Some manufactures we could make, but are forbidden and mu&s;t take of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> merchants; the whole price of the&s;e is a tax paid to Britain.</P>
<P>By our greatly increa&s;ing the demand and con&s;umption of Briti&s;h manufactures, their price is con&s;iderably rai&s;ed of late
<PB N="344" REF="028963_0173_0FDE10845B06CAF0">years: Their advance is clear profit to Britain, and enables its people better to pay great taxes; and much of it being paid by us, is a clear tax to Britain.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, as we are not &s;uffered to regulate our trade, and re|&s;train the importation and con&s;umption of Briti&s;h &s;uperfluities, (as Britain can the con&s;umption of foreign &s;uperfluities) our whole wealth centres finally among the merchants and inhabit|ants of Britain; and if we make them richer, and enable them better to pay their taxes, it is nearly the &s;ame as being taxed our&s;elves, and equally beneficial to the crown. The&s;e kind of &s;econdary taxes, however, we do not complain of, though we have no &s;hare in the laying or di&s;po&s;ing of them: But to pay immediate heavy taxes, in the laying, appropriation, and di&s;po|&s;ition of which we have no part, and which, perhaps, we may know to be as unnece&s;&s;ary as grievous, mu&s;t &s;eem hard mea&s;ure to <HI>Engli&s;hmen;</HI> who cannot conceive, that by hazarding their lives and fortunes, in &s;ubduing and &s;ettling new countries, extend|ing the dominion, and increa&s;ing the commerce of their mother nation, they have forfeited the native rights of <HI>Britons,</HI> which they think ought rather to be given them as due to &s;uch merit, if they had been before in a &s;tate of &s;lavery. The&s;e, and &s;uch kind of things as the&s;e, I apprehend, will be thought and &s;aid by the people, if the propo&s;ed alteration of the Albany plan &s;hould take place. Then the admini&s;tration of the board of governours and councils &s;o appointed, not having any repre&s;ent|ative body of the people to approve and unite in its mea&s;ures, and conciliate the minds of the people to them, will probably become &s;u&s;pected and odious: Dangerous animo&s;ities and feuds will ari&s;e between the governours and governed, and every thing go into confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Perhaps I am too apprehen&s;ive in this matter; but having freely given my opinion and rea&s;ons, your excellency can judge better than I whether there be any weight in them; and the &s;hortne&s;s of the time allowed me, will, I hope, in &s;ome degree excu&s;e the imperfections of this &s;crawl.</P>
<P>With the greate&s;t re&s;pect and fidelity, I have the honour to be, your excellency's mo&s;t obedient and mo&s;t humble &s;ervant,</P>

<P>WHILST the rulers of Britain were thus plum|ing them&s;elves on their own wi&s;dom and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">udence in conducting the affairs of the empire, the
<PB N="14" REF="028963_0179_0FDDBEAD68B785E0">Americans were preparing for a determined re&s;i&s;tance. The &s;outhern colonies began to take up arms as well as the northern; and, as &s;oon as news came of a procla|mation having been i&s;&s;ued in Britain to prevent the exportation of arms and ammunition to the colonies, every method was taken to &s;upply that defect. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> people of Rhode-I&s;land however, bolder than the re&s;t, or not having equal re&s;ources, &s;eized upon the ordnance belonging to the crown, amounting to about forty pie|ces of cannon of different &s;izes; whil&s;t the a&s;&s;embly pa&s;&s;ed re&s;olutions for the procuring of arms and mili|tary &s;tores by every means, and from every quarter in which they could be obtained, as well as for train|ing and di&s;ciplining the inhabitants. Their example was followed by the people of New Hamp&s;hire, who, with the &s;ame view, &s;urprized a &s;mall fort, called Wil|liam and Mary, from whence they were &s;upplied with as much powder and ammunition as enabled them to put them&s;elves in a po&s;ture of defence.</P>
<P>The determination of the colonies was confirmed by the news of the king's &s;peech, and the addre&s;s in an&s;wer to it.

<P>The rece&s;s of the provincial congre&s;s of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, in the beginning of November 1774, had afforded an opportunity to the friends of government, or loyal|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;ts, as they now began to be called, to try their &s;trength <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in various places. A&s;&s;ociations for mutual defence were accordingly formed, and re&s;olutions taken to op|po&s;e the provincial congre&s;s; but the a&s;&s;ociators were every where overwhelmed with prodigious majorities, and their attempts had no other effect than to mi&s;lead the governor, and through him the people of Great Britain, with regard to the general di&s;po&s;ition of the people.</P>

All their acts tended to the &s;ame point, the &s;upporting of the mea&s;ures of the continental congre&s;s. But there were great numbers in every colony, who di&s;approved of the&s;e mea&s;ures; a few, comparatively, from principle and a per&s;ua&s;ion that the &s;ame were wrong, and that they ought to &s;ubmit to the mother country; &s;ome through attachment to the late govern|mental authority exerci&s;ed among them; many from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">elf intere&s;t; but the bulk, for fear of the mi&s;chievous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on&s;equences likely to follow.

<P>On the 26th of February general Gage, having been informed that a number of field pieces had been brought to Salem, di&s;patched a party to &s;eize them. Their road was ob&s;tructed by a river, over which was a draw|bridge. This the people had pulled up, and refu&s;ed to let down: upon which the &s;oldiers &s;eized a boat to ferry them over; but the people cut out her bottom. Ho&s;|tilities would immediately have commenced, had it not been for the interpo&s;ition of a clergyman,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Reverend Thomas Barnard.</NOTE> who rep|re&s;ented to the military, on the one hand, the folly of oppo&s;ing &s;uch numbers; and to the people, on the oth|er, that as the day was far &s;pent, the military could not execute their de&s;ign, &s;o that they might without any fear leave them the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the draw-bridge. This was complied with; and the &s;oldiers, after having remained for &s;ome time at the bridge, returned without executing their orders.</P>
<P>The next attempt, however, was attended with more &s;erious con&s;equences. Generel Gage having been in|formed that a large quantity of ammunition and mili|tary &s;tores had been collected at Concord, about 20 miles from Bo&s;ton, for the &s;upport a provincial army, wi&s;hed to prevent ho&s;tilities by depriving the inhabit|ants of the means nece&s;&s;ary for carrying them on. It was likewi&s;e reported that he had a de&s;ign to &s;eize me&s;|&s;ieurs Hancock and Adams, the leading men of the congre&s;s. Wi&s;hing to accompli&s;h his de&s;ign without blood&s;hed, he took every precaution to ef|fect it by &s;urprize,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>April</HI> 18.</NOTE> and without alarming the country. At eleven o'clock at night, 800 grenadiers and light infantry, the flower of the royal army, embarked at the common, landed at Phipp's farm, and marched for Concord, under the command of lieu|tenant
<PB N="18" REF="028963_0181_0FDDBEB722D1BA10">colonel Smith. Neither the &s;ecrecy with which this expedition was planned; the privacy with which the troops marched out, nor an order that no inhabit|ants &s;hould leave Bo&s;ton, were &s;ufficient to prevent intelligence from being &s;ent to the country militia, of what was going on.</P>
<P>About two in the morning, 130 of the Lexington militia had a&s;&s;embled to oppo&s;e them, but the air being chilly, and intelligence re&s;pecting the regulars uncer|tain, they were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, with orders to appear again at beat of drum. They collected a &s;econd time to the number of 70, between 4 and 5 o'clock in the morn|ing, and the Briti&s;h regulars &s;oon after made their ap|pearance. Major Pitcairn, who led the advanced corps, rode up to them and called out, "Di&s;per&s;e you rebels, throw down your arms and di&s;per&s;e." They &s;till con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ed in a body, on which he advanced nearer&mdash;di&s;|charged his pi&s;tol&mdash;and ordered his &s;oldiers to fire. This was done with a huzza. A di&s;per&s;ion of the mil|itia was the con&s;equence, but the firing of the regulars was neverthele&s;s continued. Individuals, finding they were fired upon, though di&s;per&s;ing, returned the fire. Three or four of the militia were killed on the green. A few more were &s;hot after they had began to di&s;per&s;e. The royal detachment proceeded on to Concord, and executed their commi&s;&s;ion. They di&s;abled two 24 pounders&mdash;threw 500lb. of ball into rivers and wells, and broke in pieces about 60 barrels of flour.</P>
<P>Mr. John Butterick of Concord, major of a minute-regiment, not knowing what had pa&s;&s;ed at Lexington, ordered his men not to give the fir&s;t fire, that they might not be the aggre&s;&s;ors. Upon his approaching near the regulars, they fired, and killed captain I&s;aac Davis, and one private of the provincial minute-men. The fire was returned, and a &s;kirmi&s;h en&s;ued. The king's troops, having done their bu&s;ine&s;s, began their
<PB N="19" REF="028963_0181_0FDDBEB722D1BA10">retreat towards Bo&s;ton. This was conducted with ex|pedition, for the adjacent inhabitants had a&s;&s;embled in arms, and began to attack them in every direction. In their return to Lexington, they were exceedingly annoy|ed, both by tho&s;e who pre&s;&s;ed on their rear, and others who, pouring in from all &s;ides, fired from behind &s;tone walls, and &s;uch like coverts, which &s;upplied the place of lines and redoubts.</P>
<P>At Lexington the regulars were joined by a detach|ment of 900 men, under lord Piercy, which had been &s;ent out by general Gage to &s;upport lieutenant colonel Smith. This reinforcement having two pieces of can|non, awed the provincials, and kept them at a greater di&s;tance, but they continued a con&s;tant, though irreg|ular and &s;cattering fire, which did great execution. The clo&s;e firing from behind the walls by good mark&s;|men, put the regular troops in no &s;mall confu&s;ion, but they neverthele&s;s kept up a bri&s;k retreating fire on the militia and minute-men.</P>
<P>A little after &s;un&s;et, the regulars reached Bunker's Hill, worn down with exce&s;&s;ive fatigue, having marched that day between thirty and forty miles. On the next day they cro&s;&s;ed Charle&s;town ferry, and returned to Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>There never were more than 400 provincials engag|ed at one time, and often not &s;o many. As &s;ome tired and gave out, others came up and took their places. There was &s;carcely any di&s;cipline ob&s;erved among them. Officers and privates &s;ired when they were ready, and &s;aw a royal uniform, without waiting for the word of command. Their knowledge of the country enabled them to gain opportunities by cro&s;&s;ing fields and fenc|es, and to act as flanking parties again&s;t the king's troops, who kept to the main road.</P>
<P>The regulars had 65 killed, 180 wounded, and 28 made pri&s;oners. Of the provincials 50 were killed, and 88 wounded and mi&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="028963_0182_0FDDBEB8C7BBB0C8">
This was the fatal day remarkable for the di&s;mem|berment of the Briti&s;h empire, and the final &s;eparation of the American colonies. The provincial congre&s;s of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, which was in &s;e&s;&s;ion at the time of the battle, di&s;patched an account of it to Great Britain, accompanied with many depo&s;itions, to prove that the Briti&s;h troops were the aggre&s;&s;ors. They al&s;o addre&s;&s;ed the inhabitants of Great Britain, in which, after com|plaining of their &s;ufferings, they &s;ay, "the&s;e have not yet detached us from our royal &s;overeign; we profe&s;s to be his loyal and dutiful &s;ubjects, and though hardly dealt with, as we have been, are &s;till ready with our lives and fortunes, to defend his per&s;on, crown, and dignity.

<P>To prevent the people of Bo&s;ton from joining their countrymen in the vicinity, in an attack which wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> threatened, general Gage agreed with the town com|mittee that upon the inhabitants lodging their arms <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Faneuil hall, or any other convenient place, under th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> care of the &s;electmen, &s;uch inhabitants as cho&s;e might depart with their families and effects.

The provincial congre&s;s remon|&s;trated, but without effect. Pa&s;&s;ports were not uni|ver&s;ally refu&s;ed, but were given out &s;lowly. The gen|eral &s;hewed a di&s;inclination to part with the women and children, thinking, that, by retaining them, the provincials would be re&s;trained from a&s;&s;aulting the town. This occa&s;ioned very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;cenes&mdash;wives &s;eparated from their hu&s;bands&mdash;children from their parents&mdash;and the aged and infirm from their relations and friends: and this di&s;tre&s;s was heightened by the quibble which was made on the meaning of the word <HI>effects,</HI> which the general con&s;trued as not including merchandize; whereby he deprived the provincials of a &s;upply of tho&s;e articles of which they &s;tood mo&s;t in need.

<P>The flame of civil di&s;cord now broke out in all its fury. The bravery &s;hown by the American militia in their fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay at Lexington, and the advantages they imagined them&s;elves to have gained, afforded great mat|ter of exultation.</P>
<P>The &s;pirits of the people were &s;o rai&s;ed, that they meditated nothing le&s;s than the total expul&s;ion of the Briti&s;h troops from Bo&s;ton. An army of 20,000 men was a&s;&s;embled, who formed a line of encampment from Roxbury to My&s;tic; and here they were &s;oon after pined by a large body of Connecticut troops, under general Putnam, an old officer of great bravery and experience. By this formidable force was the town of
<PB N="22" REF="028963_0183_0FDDBEBA2E4D68A8">Bo&s;ton now kept blocked up. General Gage, however, had &s;o &s;trongly fortified it, that the provincials, power|ful as they were, dur&s;t not make an attack; whil&s;t, on the other hand, his force was by far too in&s;ignifi|cant to meet &s;uch an enemy in the field.</P>
<P>Re&s;i&s;tance being univer&s;ally re&s;olved on by the A|mericans, the pulpit, the pre&s;s, the bench and the bar &s;everally laboured to encourage them. The clergy of New England were a numerous, learned, and re&s;pectable body, who had a great a&s;cendency on the minds of their hearers. Their number is &s;aid to have amount|ed to 700, and their exertions in the public cau&s;e were important and effectual. In their prayers and in their &s;ermons they repre&s;ented the cau&s;e of America as the cau&s;e of heaven. The &s;ynod of New York and Philadelphia &s;ent forth a pa&s;toral letter, which was publickly read in their churches. This earne&s;tly re|commended &s;uch &s;entiments and conduct as were &s;uit|able to their &s;ituation. Writers and printers followed in the rear of the preachers, and next to them had the greate&s;t hand in animating their countrymen. Gentle|men of the bench and of the bar denied the charge of rebellion, and ju&s;tified the re&s;i&s;tance of the coloni&s;ts. A di&s;tinction, founded on law, between the king and his mini&s;try, was introduced. The former, it was contended, could do no wrong.

<P>The nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ecuring Ticonderoga was early at|tended to by many in New England. General Gage had &s;et the example of attempting to &s;eize upon mili|tary &s;tores, and by &s;o doing had commenced ho&s;tilities, &s;o that retaliation appeared warrantable.</P>
<P>Colonel Allen was at Ca&s;tleton with about 270 men, 230 of which were Green Mountain Boys, &s;o called from their re&s;iding within the limits of the Green Mountains, the Hamp&s;hire grants being &s;o denominat|ed, from the range of green mountains that run through them. Centinels were placed immediately on all the roads to prevent any intelligence being carried to Ticonderoga.</P>
<P>Colonel Arnold, who now joined colonel Allen, re|ported, that there were at Ticonderoga, 80 pieces of heavy cannon, 20 of bra&s;s, from four to eighteen pounders, ten or a dozen mortars, a number of &s;mall arms, and con&s;iderable &s;tores; that the fort was in a ruinous condition, and, as he &s;uppo&s;ed, garri&s;oned by about forty men. It was then &s;ettled, that colonel Allen &s;hould have the &s;upreme command, and colonel Arnold was to be his a&s;&s;i&s;tant.</P>
<P>They arrived at Lake Champlain, oppo&s;ite Ticonde|roga, on the ninth of May at night. Boats were with difficulty procured, when he and colonel Arnold cro&s;&s;|ed
<PB N="24" REF="028963_0184_0FDDBEBBE54A8DF8">over with 83 men, and landed near the garri&s;on: The two colonels advanced along &s;ide each other, and entered the port, leading to the fort, in the grey of the morning. A centinel &s;napped his fu&s;ee at colonel Al|len, and then retreated through the covered way to the parade. The main body of the Americans then fol|lowed and drew up. Captain de la Place, the com|mander, was &s;urprized in bed. Thus the place was taken without any blood&s;hed. They likewi&s;e &s;urpriz|ed Crown Point, in which there was a garri&s;on of twelve men. They took, al&s;o, two &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, and found materials at Ticonderoga for building others. By this expedition the provincials acquired great quan|tities of ammunition and military &s;tores; and obtained the command of Lake Champlain, which &s;ecured them a pa&s;&s;age into Canada. Colonel Allen went home, and colonel Arnold, with a number of men, agreed to re|main there in garri&s;on. Colonel Arnold, after a &s;eries of &s;ucce&s;&s;es, formed the bold plan of invading Canada. He wrote to congre&s;s, that with 2000 men he would reduce the whole province. His great exertions, when that mea&s;ure was adopted, will be related hereafter.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s, before its di&s;&s;olution on the 26th of October 1774, recommended to the colonies, to chu&s;e members for another, to meet on the 10th of May 1775, unle&s;s the redre&s;s of their grievances was previou&s;ly obtained. A circular letter had been addre&s;&s;ed by lord Dartmouth to the &s;everal colonial governours, reque&s;ting their in|terference to prevent the meeting of this &s;econd con|gre&s;s; but the&s;e requi&s;itions had lo&s;t their influence delegates were elected not only for the twelve colonies that were before repre&s;ented, but al&s;o for the pari&s;h of St. John's in Georgia.</P>
<P>On their meeting, the day after the cap|ture of Ticonderoga,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>May</HI> 10.</NOTE> they cho&s;e Peyton Ran|dolph for their pre&s;ident, and Charles Thom&s;on for

On the next day Mr. H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">k, who &s;oon after &s;ucceeded Mr. Randolph as pre&s;ident, laid before them an account of the late great events of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts: whereupon congre&s;s re&s;olved it&s;elf in|to a committee of the whole, to take into con&s;ideration the affairs of America. The line of moderation and firmne&s;s which they pur&s;ued will be hereafter related.</P>
<P>Towards the latter end of May, a con&s;iderable rein|forcement having arrived with the Briti&s;h generals Howe, Burgoyne and Clinton, general Gage was ena|bled to attempt &s;omething of con&s;equence; and this the boa&s;ts of the provincials, that they were be&s;ieging tho&s;e who had been &s;ent to &s;ubdue them, &s;eemed to render nece&s;&s;ary. Some &s;kirmi&s;hes in the mean time happened in the i&s;lands lying off Bo&s;ton harbour, in which the Americans had the advantage, and burned an armed &s;chooner, which her people had been obliged to aban|don after &s;he was left aground by the tide.</P>
<P>Ho&s;tilities were now forwarded by the re&s;olves of the continental congre&s;s, which on the 8th of June, declared the compact between the crown and the peo|ple of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay to be di&s;&s;olved by the violation of the charter of William and Mary. They, at the &s;ame time, recommended to the people, to e&s;tabli&s;h a new government, until a governour of his maje&s;ty's ap|pointment will con&s;ent to govern the colony according to its charter. They prohibited them from negociating any bill, or tran&s;acting any bu&s;ine&s;s with the &s;ea or land officers of Britain, their agents or contractors, furni&s;hing them with &s;tores or provi&s;ions of any kind. A general po&s;t office was e&s;tabli&s;hed at Philadelphia, at the head of which they placed Dr. Franklin, who had been deprived of the &s;ame place in England.</P>
<P>General Gage, on the other hand, i&s;&s;ued a procla|mation, wherein he offered a pardon in the king's name, to all who &s;hould forthwith lay down their arms and
<PB N="26" REF="028963_0185_0FDD5F39F02DD108">return to their re&s;pective occupations and peaceable duties, excepting only from the benefit of that pardon, "Samuel Adams and John Hancock, who&s;e offences were &s;aid to be of too flagitious a nature to admit of any other con&s;ideration than that of condign puni&s;h|ment." It was al&s;o declared, that not only the per&s;ons above named and excepted, but al&s;o all their adherents, a&s;&s;ociates, and corre&s;pondents, &s;hould be deemed guilty of trea&s;on and rebellion, and treated accordingly. "That all the courts of judicature were &s;hut, and martial law &s;hould take place, till a due cour&s;e of ju&s;tice &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed."</P>
<P>The Americans, &s;uppo&s;ing this proclamation to be a prelude to ho&s;tilities, prepared for action. Orders were therefore i&s;&s;ued by the provincial commander<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that a detachment of one thou&s;and men &s;hould intrench upon Bunker's Hill, a con&s;iderable height ju&s;t at th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> entrance of the penin&s;ula at Charle&s;town; the &s;ituation of which rendered the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it of great importance to either party.

<P>In the night of the 16th of June, the provincials took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Breed's Hill, and worked with &s;uch indefatigable diligence, that, to the a&s;toni&s;hment o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their enemies, they had between midnight and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> dawn of the next morning, thrown up a redoubt abou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> eight reds &s;quare.

<PB N="27" REF="028963_0185_0FDD5F39F02DD108">&s;ide of the redoubt to the bottom of the hill before mid-day; but they were prevented completing it by the intolerable fire of the enemy. By &s;ome unaccount|able errour, the detachment, which had been working for hours, was neither relieved nor &s;upplied with re|fre&s;hments, but were left to engage under the&s;e di&s;ad|vantages.</P>
<P>Between twelve and one o'clock, and the day ex|ceedingly hot, a number of boats and barges filled with regular troops from Bo&s;ton approached Charle&s;town, when the men were landed at Moreton's Point, a little to the ea&s;tward of the American works. They con|&s;i&s;ted of four battalions, two companies of grenadiers, and ten of light infantry, with a proportion of field ar|tillery; but, by &s;ome over&s;ight, their &s;pare cartridges were much too big for them: &s;o that, when the Ame|ricans were at length forced from their lines; there was not a round of artillery cartridges remaining.</P>
<P>Major general Howe and brigadier general Pigot had the command. The troops formed and remained in that po&s;ition, till joined by a &s;econd detachment of light infantry and grenadier companies, a battalion of the land forces, and a battalion of marines, amounting in the whole to about 3000 men. The generals Clinton and Burgoyne took their &s;tand upon Copp's Hill, to ob&s;erve and contemplate the bloody and de&s;tructive operations that were now commencing. The regulars formed in two lines, and advanced deliberately, fre|quently halting to give time for the artillery to fire, which was not well &s;erved. The light infantry were directed to force the left point of the brea&s;t work, and to take the American line in flank. The grenadiers advanced to attack in front, &s;upported by two battal|ions, whil&s;t the left, under general Pigot, inclined to the right of the American line. One or two of the continental regiments had been po&s;ted in Charle&s;town,
<PB N="28" REF="028963_0186_0FDDBEBD5EAC37F8">but afterwards removed to prevent their being cut o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> by a &s;udden attack; &s;o that the Briti&s;h were not in the lea&s;t hurt by the mu&s;quetry from thence.</P>
<P>General Gage had for &s;ome time re&s;olved upon burn|ing the town, whenever any works were rai&s;ed by the Americans upon the hills belonging to it: and whil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the Briti&s;h were advancing nearer to the attack, order<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> came to Copp's Hill for executing the re&s;olution.

<P>The regulars derived no advantage from the &s;mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of the conflagration, for the wind &s;uddenly &s;hifting carried it another way, &s;o that it could not cover the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> in their approach.

Their officers u&s;ed ev|ery effort to make them return to the charge, with which they at length complied; but the Americans again re&s;erved their fire till the regulars came within five or &s;ix rods, when the enemy was a &s;econd time &s;taggered. The troops were thrown into &s;uch di&s;order, that for a few moments general Howe was &s;aid to have been left almo&s;t alone, and all the officers near him ei|ther killed or wounded. In this critical moment, gen|eral Clinton, who arrived at the place of action from Bo&s;ton during the engagement, rallied the troops almo&s;t in&s;tantaneou&s;ly, and brought them back to the charge; at the &s;ame time the Briti&s;h reaped a farther advantage, by bringing &s;ome cannon to bear, &s;o as to rake the in|&s;ide of the brea&s;t work from end to end. The works were now every where attacked with fixed bayonets, and, as many of the Americans were de&s;titute of that weapon, and their powder beginning to fail, they were forced to yield, though not till after an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;t|ance. At la&s;t they retreated over Charle&s;town neck, which was enfiladed by the guns of the Gla&s;gow man of war and two floating batteries. They &s;uffered but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ittle however, from this formidable artillery, though the fear of it had prevented &s;ome regiments, who were ordered to &s;upport them, from fulfilling their duty.</P>
<P>It was feared by the Americans, that the Briti&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">roops would pu&s;h the advantage they had gained, and march immediately to the head quarters at Cambridge, about two miles di&s;tant, and in no &s;tate of defence. But they advanced no farther than to Bunker's Hill, where they threw up works for their own &s;ecurity. The provincials did the &s;ame on Pro&s;pect Hill, in front of them, about half way to Cambridge.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nov.</HI> 29.</NOTE> commanded by captain Manly of Marblehead, captured the brig Nancy, as ordnance &s;hip from Woolwich, containing a large bra&s;t mortar, upon a new con&s;truction, afterwards called the Congre&s;s, &s;everal pieces of bra&s;s cannon, a large quan|tity of arms and ammunition, with all manner of tools uten&s;ils and machines nece&s;&s;ary for camps and artillery; &s;o that had congre&s;s &s;ent an order for the articles mo&s;t wanted, they could not have made out a more &s;uitable invoice. The whole value of the ve&s;&s;el and cargo was computed at 50,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> and this lo&s;s, in particular, occa|&s;ioned much di&s;content in Britain.</P>
<P>About two months before this valuable capture, a &s;hip from Bri&s;tol to Bo&s;ton, with flour, having parted with her convoy, was decoyed into Port&s;mouth, New Hamp&s;hire, and &s;ecured for the benefit of the Ameri|cans. Several &s;tore &s;hips were captured in the month of December. Among others, captain Manly took three, with various &s;tores for the troops in Bo&s;ton, and a brig from Antigua with rum.</P>
<P>The&s;e were part of the immen&s;e &s;upplies which the Briti&s;h mini&s;try had prepared for the relief of the troops in Bo&s;ton. It is &s;aid that no fewer than five thou&s;and oxen, fourteen thou&s;and of the large&s;t and farte&s;t &s;heep, with a va&s;t number of hogs, were purcha&s;ed and &s;ent out alive. Incredible quantities of vegetables were al|&s;o bought up, and cured by new methods. Ten thou|&s;and butts of &s;trong beer were &s;upplied by two brewers. Five thou&s;and chaldrons of coals were purcha&s;ed i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the river Thames and &s;hipped off for Bo&s;ton; and e|ven the article of faggots was &s;ent from London. The immen&s;e expen&s;e of maintaining armies at &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="49" REF="028963_0196_0FDDBEDF0E87AA60">di&s;tance from Britain, was now, for the fir&s;t time, exper|imentally felt. Some e&s;timate of the expen&s;e of the whole may be formed, from that of the trifling arti|cles of vegetables, ca&s;ks and vinegar, which amounted to little le&s;s than 22,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> and the articles of hay, oats, and beans, for a &s;ingle regiment of light cavalry, to nearly as much more. Be&s;ides all this enormous expen&s;e, and the charge of flour, corn, and &s;alted pro|vi&s;ions, near half a million of money was expended in the purcha&s;e of Spani&s;h and Portugue&s;e coin for the extraordinary and contingent articles in various branch|es of the military operations. In fine, the expen&s;e in every article, was &s;welled to the utmo&s;t.</P>
<P>It was not without rea&s;on &s;uppo&s;ed, in Britain, that by &s;uch unbounded &s;upplies, the troops would be re|&s;tored to health and &s;pirits, and the general complaint &s;ilenced, that had for &s;ome time prevailed, concerning the bad and unwhole&s;ome quality of the provi&s;ions with which they had been &s;upplied. But things turned out, however, in a manner directly oppo&s;ite to every expec|tation of this kind. After every delay in fitting out had been &s;urmounted, the ve&s;&s;els were detained for a long time on the coa&s;t of Britain, or to&s;&s;ed about by con|trary winds in the channel, until the greater part of the live &s;tock, particularly the &s;heep, peri&s;hed; &s;o that the &s;ea was every where &s;trewed with their carca&s;es. Con|trary winds and &s;tormy weather pur&s;ued them on their voyage in the mid &s;eas; and as they approached the place of their de&s;tination, the wind blew full in their teeth and drove them off the coa&s;ts. Several of them were blown to the We&s;t India I&s;lands in great di&s;tre&s;s; others, entangled with the American coa&s;ts, were either taken at &s;ea, or in the harbours and creeks where they put in for &s;helter. A few arrived at Bo&s;ton, after hav|ing been beat about in &s;tormy &s;eas for three or four months, with their cargoes almo&s;t entirely &s;poilt, yield|ing
<PB N="50" REF="028963_0197_0FDDBEE080466770">a very incon&s;iderable portion of refre&s;hments to the troops, after having been purcha&s;ed at &s;uch an enormous co&s;t.</P>
<P>The di&s;a&s;ters which attended the Bo&s;ton tran&s;ports &s;eemed al&s;o to have waited on the Newfoundland fi&s;h|ery for the year 1775. It did not at all realize the &s;an|guine expectations of the mini&s;try with re&s;pect to its ea&s;y tran&s;lation from America to Britain. The Americans, by cutting off all &s;upplies of provi&s;ions from the &s;hips employed in the fi&s;hery, threw every thing into di&s;or|der. So that by &s;ending off a number of &s;hips to Ire|land for provi&s;ions, &s;uch a neglect was occa&s;ioned in the fi&s;hery, that the value of more than half a million &s;terling of the u&s;ual produce was left in the bowels of the deep.</P>
<P>A dreadful tempe&s;t, likewi&s;e, which di&s;charged it&s;elf chiefly on the &s;hores of Newfoundland, contributed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> render abortive the &s;ucce&s;s of tho&s;e who remained. The &s;ea is &s;aid to have ri&s;en, almo&s;t in&s;tantaneou&s;ly thirty feet above its level. Upwards of &s;even hundred boats, with a number of &s;hips, with all on board, per|i&s;hed in the ocean, whil&s;t the waves, &s;urpa&s;&s;ing their u&s;ual bounds &s;o far, overwhelmed every thing with a rapid and unavoidable de&s;truction. The &s;hores pre|&s;ented a &s;hocking &s;pectacle for &s;ome time after, and the fi&s;hing nets were hauled up loaded with dead bodies. The&s;e di&s;a&s;ters were, by &s;ome, a&s;cribed to the immedi|ate vengeance of the Deity on the oppo&s;ite party.</P>
<P>The accumulated misfortunes of the Briti&s;h, as they gave new life and &s;pirit to the coloni&s;ts, could not but add greatly to the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the troops and inhabit|ants blocked up in Bo&s;ton. The Briti&s;h had the mor|tification to &s;ee a number of the tran&s;ports taken in the very entrance of the harbour, whil&s;t, from various cau&s;es, the &s;hips of war were prevented from affording them any relief: thus the American camp obtained
<PB N="51" REF="028963_0197_0FDDBEE080466770">the &s;tores and nece&s;&s;aries which had been de&s;tined for the &s;u&s;tenance and u&s;e of their enemies.</P>
<P>In order to &s;upply the troops in Bo&s;ton with pro|vi&s;ions, it had been found nece&s;&s;ary to carry on a kind of predatory war. In the cour&s;e of which, the town of Falmouth, in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, having given &s;ome offence relative to the loading of a ma&s;t &s;hip, was con|demned to the flames. The officer, captain Mowat, is &s;aid to have declared he had orders for burning all the towns on the coa&s;t between Bo&s;ton and Halifax. However, he gave the people time to remove their families from the danger, which, under pretence of a negociation for delivering up their arms, was length|ened out till next morning; during which time, they had removed the greate&s;t part of their effects. About nine in the morning, on the 18th of October, on their refu&s;al to deliver up their arms, and &s;ome carriage guns, a violent di&s;charge of cannon and mortars took place, from four armed ve&s;&s;els. Above three thou&s;and &s;hot, be&s;ides bombs and carea&s;es, were thrown into the town, by which the principal part of it, lying next the water, and con&s;i&s;ting of 130 dwelling hou&s;es, and 278 warehou&s;es, together with the church, a new hand&s;ome court-hou&s;e, the old town-hou&s;e, and public library, were reduced to a&s;hes. About one hundred of the wor&s;t hou&s;es, favoured by their &s;ituation and di&s;tance, e&s;caped without damage. This produced an alarm on the &s;ea coa&s;t, and occa&s;ioned many to move with their families and effects farther into the country, but had no tendency to procure the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the people to the power and mercy of the armed Briti&s;h agents.</P>
<P>A few days after the burning of Falmouth, the Brit|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;h took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Old South meeting-hou&s;e in Bo&s;ton, and de&s;tined it for a riding &s;chool for the u&s;e of the light dragoons. The&s;e proceedings naturally increa&s;ed the irritability of the minds of the people, and
<PB N="52" REF="028963_0198_0FDDBEE1E6CA5FC8">induced a more determined &s;pirit of refi&s;tance and aver&s;ion to Great Britain.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t ho&s;tilities that happened in New York, commenced in the month of Augu&s;t. The New York convention having re&s;olved upon the removal of the cannon from the battery of that city, captain Sears w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> appointed to the bu&s;ine&s;s. Captain Vandeput, of the A&s;ia man of war, was privately informed of the de&s;ign, and prepared to oppo&s;e its execution. Learning wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> it was to be attempted, he appointed a boat to watch the motions of the people a&s;&s;embled for the purpo&s;e, about the dead of night. The &s;ailors in the boat, giving the &s;ignal, with a fla&s;h of powder, of what was going forward, the people on &s;hore mi&s;took it for an attempt to fire a mu&s;ket at them, and immediately aimed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> volley of &s;hot at the boat, by which a man was kill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Captain Vandeput &s;oon after commenced a firing from the A&s;ia with grape &s;hot, &s;wivel &s;hot, 18 and 24 pound|ers, without killing a &s;ingle per&s;on, and wounded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> three, two &s;lightly, the other lo&s;t the calf of his leg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> He then cea&s;ed a con&s;iderable time, &s;uppo&s;ing that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> people had de&s;i&s;ted from their purpo&s;e, whil&s;t they we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> only changing their mode of operation.</P>
<P>Captain Sears provided a deceiving party, with in|tention to draw the A&s;ia's fire from the line of the work|ing party. He &s;ent the former behind a brea&s;twork by which they were &s;ecured by dodging down up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> ob&s;erving the fla&s;h of the A&s;ia's guns. When all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in readine&s;s, they huzzaed and &s;ung out their notes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> though tugging in uni&s;on, and fired from the walls <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> whil&s;t the working party &s;ilently got off twenty-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> eighteen pounders, with carriages, empty carriages rammers, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Upon hearing the noi&s;e and &s;eeing the fire of the mu&s;ketry, the captain ordered a whole broad&s;ide <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> be fired towards that part of the fort where the de|ceiving

<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Aug.</HI> 24.</NOTE> with|out intending any particular injury to the city. However, &s;ome of the &s;hot flew into the city and did damage.</P>
<P>This affair happened between twelve o'clock at night and two in the morning, and threw the inhabitants into the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation. The di&s;tre&s;s of the New Yorkers was very much increa&s;ed by a painful appre|hen&s;ion, that captain Vandeput would renew his firing upon the city. A removal of men, women, children, and goods commenced, and continued for &s;ome time. Matters were however &s;o far adju&s;ted, as to quiet the apprehen&s;ions of the people, in reference to their &s;uf|fering farther from the fire of the A&s;ia. To prevent it, the convention permitted Abraham Lott, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> to &s;upply the king's &s;hips, &s;tationed at New York, with all nece&s;&s;aries, as well fre&s;h as &s;alted, for the u&s;e of tho&s;e &s;hips.</P>
<P>In the month of November, the general a&s;&s;embly of Rhode I&s;land pa&s;&s;ed an act for the capital puni&s;hment of per&s;ons, who &s;hould be found guilty of holding a traitorous corre&s;pondence with the mini&s;try of Great Britain, or any of their officers or agents, or of &s;upply|ing the mini&s;terial army or navy, employed again&s;t the United Colonies, with provi&s;ions, arms, &amp;c. or of act|ing as pilots on board any of their ve&s;&s;els. They al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed an act for &s;eque&s;tering the e&s;tates of &s;everal per&s;ons, whom they con&s;idered as avowed enemies to the liberties of America.</P>
<P>Ho&s;tilities commenced in Georgia, between the op|po&s;ite parties, about the middle of November, when a number of royali&s;ts attacked the Americans, and oblig|ed them after three days, to &s;urrender a fort they had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, in which they expected to make an effectual re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Before the clo&s;e of the year congre&s;s re&s;olved to build five ve&s;&s;els of 32 guns, five of 28, and three of 24, in

By or|der of congre&s;s, therefore, 3000 men were put under the command of generals Montgomery and Schuyler, to whom were committed the management of their military arrangements in the northern department, with orders to proceed to Lake Champlain, from whence they were to be conveyed in flat bottomed boats to the mouth of the river Sorel, a branch of the great river St. Lawrence, and on which is &s;ituated a fort of the &s;ame name with the river. On the other hand, they were oppo&s;ed by general Carleton, governour of Cana|da, a man of great activity and experience in war, who, with a very few troops, had hitherto been able to keep in awe the di&s;affected people of Canada, notwith|&s;tanding all the repre&s;entations of the coloni&s;ts.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as general Montgomery arrived at Crown Point, he received information that &s;everal arm|ed ve&s;&s;els were &s;tationed at St. John's, a &s;trong fort on the Sorel, with a view to prevent his cro&s;&s;ing the lake, on which he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an i&s;land which commands the mouth of the Sorel, and by which he could prevent them from entering the lake. In conjunction with general Schuyler, he next proceeded to St John's: but finding that place too &s;trong, it was agreed in a council of war, to retire to I&s;le aux Noix, where general Schuyler being taken ill, Montgomery was left to com|mand alone. His fir&s;t &s;tep was to gain over the Indians whom general Carleton had employed, and this he in a great mea&s;ure accompli&s;hed; after which, on receiv|ing the full number of troops appointed for his expe|dition, he determined to lay &s;iege to St. John's, the fir&s;t Briti&s;h po&s;t in Canada, being 115 miles to the northward of Ticonderoga. In this he was facilitated by the reduction of Chamblee, a &s;mall fort in the neighbour|hood, where he found a &s;upply of &s;ix tons of gunpow|der. An attempt was made by general Carleton to re|lieve the place; for which purpo&s;e he with great pains

"This deliverance of Quebeck," &s;ays Dr. Ram&s;ay, "may be con&s;idered as a proof how much may be done by one man for the pre&s;ervation of a country. It al&s;o proves that &s;oldiers may in a &s;hort time be formed out of the ma&s;s of citizens."</P>
<P>The conduct and courage of general Carleton in the defence of his province, and the behaviour of the gar|ri&s;on, met with de&s;erved applau&s;e; nor could the val|our of the American troops be exceeded. They had fought under as great di&s;advantages as tho&s;e which at|tended the Briti&s;h at Bunker's hill, and had behaved equally well, although un&s;ucce&s;sful. Such a terrible difa&s;ter left no hope remaining of the accompli&s;hment of their purpo&s;e, as the force under general Arnold was now greatly reduced. He did not, however, aban|don the province, or even remove to a greater di&s;tance than three miles from Quebeck.</P>
<P>The provincials &s;trengthened their camp in the be&s;t manner they could, being apprehen&s;ive of an attack from the garri&s;on.

Though the &s;everity of the winter was far beyond any thing they had hitherto experienced the &s;now lying four feet deep on a level, he made a &s;hift not only to keep his troops together, but to render them formidable. An expre&s;s was di&s;patched to general Woo&s;ter, who was at Montreal, to come with a rein|forcement, and a&s;&s;ume the command; but as this could not be in&s;tantly done, he bore up, with the &s;mall force he had, again&s;t the difficulties which &s;urrounded him, and by ob&s;tructing the &s;upplies of provi&s;ions and other,

<P>In the mean time, a &s;cheme of the utmo&s;t magnitude and importance was formed by one Mr. Connelly, a Penn&s;ylvanian, attached to the cau&s;e of Britain.

On his return, he was di&s;patched to general Gage, from whom he received a colonel's commi&s;&s;ion, and &s;et out in order to accompli&s;h the remainder of his &s;cheme. The plan in general was, that he &s;hould re|turn to the Ohio, where, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Brit|i&s;h and Indians in the&s;e parts, he was to penetrate through the back &s;ettlements into Virginia, and join <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ord Dunmore at Alexandria.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">1776, <HI>March.</HI></NOTE> Thus matters contin|ued till the month of March 1776, when the town was evacuated.</P>
<P>General Wa&s;hington opened a battery on the we&s;t &s;ide of the town, from whence it was bombarded, with a heavy fire of cannon at the &s;ame time; and three days after, it was attacked by another battery from the ea&s;tern &s;hore. This terrible attack continued for 14 days without intermi&s;&s;ion; when general Howe, find|ing the place no longer tenable, determined if po&s;&s;ible to drive the enemy from their works. Preparations were therefore made for a mo&s;t vigorous attack, on a hill called Dorche&s;ter Neck, which, during one night, the Americans had fortified in &s;uch a manner as would in all probability have rendered the enter|pri&s;e next to de&s;perate. No difficulties, however, were &s;ufficient to daunt the &s;pirit of the general; and every thing was in readine&s;s, when a &s;udden &s;torm prevented an exertion which mu&s;t have been productive of a dreadful wa&s;te of blood. Next day, upon a more clo&s;e in&s;pection of the works they were to attack, it was thought advi&s;able to de&s;i&s;t from the enterpri&s;e alto|gether. The fortifications were very &s;trong, and ex|tremely well provided with artillery; and, be&s;ides other implements of de&s;truction, upwards of 100 hog&s;heads of &s;tones were provided to roll down upon the enemy as they came up; which, as the a&s;cent was extremely &s;teep, mu&s;t have done prodigious execution.</P>
<P>Nothing therefore now remained but to think of a retreat; and even this was attended with the utmo&s;t difficulty and danger. The Americans, however, know|ing that it was in the power of the Briti&s;h general to reduce the town to a&s;hes, which could not have been
<PB N="70" REF="028963_0207_0FDDBEFED2FDA220">repaired in many years, and being told by four of the &s;electmen, who were allowed to go to the American camp, that general Howe did not intend to burn the town unle&s;s he was impeded in his embarkation, did not think proper to give the lea&s;t mole&s;tation; and for the &s;pace of a fortnight the troops were employed in the evacuation of the place, from whence they carried along with them 2000 of the inhabitants, who dur&s;t not &s;tay, on account of their attachment to the Briti&s;h cau&s;e. Several &s;hips were left behind, in order to pro|tect &s;uch ve&s;&s;els as &s;hould arrive from Britain; and the fortifications of Ca&s;tle William were blown up, le&s;t the Americans &s;hould, by their means, lock up the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of war in the harbour, and render any future attempt on the town by &s;ea, totally impracticable. From Bo&s;|ton they &s;ailed to Halifax; but all their vigilance could not prevent a number of valuable &s;hips from fall|ing into the hands of the Americans. During the embarkation of the rear of the royal army, general Wa&s;hington marched into the town of Bo&s;ton with all the parade of vic|tory,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>March</HI> 17.</NOTE> and was received by the inhabitants, who now recovered their liberty, with every po&s;&s;ible mark of gratitude and re&s;pect, as their deliverer. He likewi&s;e received the public thanks of the a&s;&s;embly of the province. Being apprehen&s;ive however, that general Howe, who had rather more than 7000 men embark|ed, might make &s;ome attempt on New York, he that very day &s;ent off &s;ome regiments for the defence of the place, under the conduct of general Lee. A con|&s;iderable quantity of cannon and ammunition had al&s;o been left at Bunker's Hill and Bo&s;ton Neck; and in the town, an immen&s;e variety of goods, principally woollen and linen, of which the provincials &s;tood very much in need. Some &s;hops, it is &s;aid, were opened and &s;tripped of their goods by the &s;oldiers; part w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">
<PB N="71" REF="028963_0207_0FDDBEFED2FDA220">carried off, and part wantonly de&s;troyed. The&s;e ir|regularities were forbidden in orders, and the guilty threatened with death; but neverthele&s;s much mi&s;|chief was committed. The e&s;tates of tho&s;e who fled to Halifax were confi&s;cated; as al&s;o tho&s;e who were attached to government, and had remained in the town.</P>
<P>As an attack was expected as &s;oon as the Briti&s;h forces &s;hould arrive, every method was employed to render the fortifications, already very &s;trong, impreg|nable. For this purpo&s;e, &s;ome foreign engineers were employed, who had before arrived at Bo&s;ton; and &s;o eager were people of all ranks to accompli&s;h this bu&s;i|ne&s;s, that every able bodied man in the place, without di&s;tinction of rank, &s;et apart two days in the week, to complete it the &s;ooner.</P>

<P>IN Canada, the American arms continued un&s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ce&s;sful; nor did they ever recover after the blo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> they received before the walls of Quebeck.

<P>Congre&s;s, in their letter to the Canadians, ob&s;erved, "Such is the lot of human nature,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Jan.</HI> 24.</NOTE> that the be&s;t of cau&s;es are &s;ubject to vici&s;&s;itudes; but generous &s;ouls, enlightened and warmed with the fire of liberty, become more re&s;olute as difficulties increa&s;e." They &s;tated to them, that "eight battalions were rai&s;ing to proceed to their province, and that if more force was nece&s;&s;ary it &s;hould be &s;ent." They reque&s;t|ed them to &s;eize with eagerne&s;s the favourable oppor|tunity then offered to co-operate in the pre&s;ent glori|ous enterpri&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="028963_0208_0FDDBF00449B0420">
The cau&s;e of the Americans had received &s;uch pow|erful aid from many patriotic publications in their ga|zettes, and from the fervent exhortations of popular preachers, connecting the cau&s;e of liberty with the principles of religion, that it was determined to employ the&s;e two powerful in&s;truments, printing and preach|ing, to operate on the minds of the Canadians. A complete apparatus for printing, together with a printer and a clergyman, were therefore &s;ent into Canada.</P>
<P>The&s;e powerful auxiliaries were, however, of no avail. Reinforcements had been promi&s;ed to general Arnold, who &s;till continued the blockade of Quebeck; but they did not arrive in time to &s;econd his opera|tions. Being &s;en&s;ible, however, that he mu&s;t either de&s;i&s;t from the enterpri&s;e, or fini&s;h it &s;ucce&s;sfully, he recommenced in form; attempting to burn the &s;hip|ping, and even to &s;torm the town it&s;elf. The provin|cials were un&s;ucce&s;sful, by rea&s;on of the &s;mallne&s;s of their number, though they &s;ucceeded &s;o far as to burn a number of hou&s;es in the &s;uburbs; and the garri&s;on were obliged to pull down the remainder, in order to prevent the &s;ire from &s;preading.</P>
<P>As the provincials, though unable to reduce the town, kept the garri&s;on in continual alarms, and in a very di&s;agreeable &s;ituation,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>March</HI> 25.</NOTE> &s;ome of the nobility collected them&s;elves into a body under the command of one Mr. Beaujeu, in or|der to relieve the capital; but they were met on their march, and &s;o entirely defeated, that they were never afterwards able to attempt any thing.</P>
<P>By the fir&s;t of May &s;o many new troops had arriv|ed, that the American army, in name, amounted to 3000; but they had little rea&s;on to plume them&s;elves on their &s;ucce&s;s or augmented numbers. Their want of artillery at la&s;t convinced them, that it was imprac|ticable in their &s;ituation to reduce a place &s;o &s;trongly
<PB N="74" REF="028963_0209_0FDDBF0165BD4528">fortified; the &s;mall pox at the &s;ame time made its ap|pearance in their camp, and carried off great numbers; intimidating the re&s;t to &s;uch a degree, that they de&s;ert|ed in crowds. The affections of the Canadians were likewi&s;e alienated by the rapacity and love of plunder which led many of the invading army to practices, di&s;|graceful to them&s;elves, and injurious to the cau&s;e in which they had taken up arms. To add to their mis|fortunes, the Briti&s;h reinforcements unexpectedly ap|peared, and the &s;hips made their way through the ice with &s;uch celerity, that the one part of their army was &s;eparated from the other, and general Carle|ton,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>May</HI> 6.</NOTE> &s;allying out as &s;oon as the reinforcement was landed, obliged them to fly with the ut|mo&s;t precipitation, leaving behind them all their cannon and military &s;tores; at the &s;ame time that their &s;hip|ping was entirely captured by ve&s;&s;els &s;ent up the river for that purpo&s;e. On this occa&s;ion the provincials fled &s;o fa&s;t that they could not be overtaken; &s;o that none fell into the hands of the Briti&s;h, excepting the &s;ick and the wounded.</P>
<P>The humanity and genero&s;ity of general Carleton met with no le&s;s applau&s;e, on this pro&s;perous turn in his favour, than what he acquired by the brave and ju|dicious defence he had made, whil&s;t every thing &s;eemed to con&s;pire again&s;t him. A number of the &s;ick and wounded Americans were &s;cattered about in the woods and villages, not only de&s;titute of every comfort nece&s;|&s;ary in their mi&s;erable &s;ituation, but in the utmo&s;t dan|ger of peri&s;hing for want. To prevent the melancholy fate which threatened the&s;e unfortunate men, the vio|torious general i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, to re|move their doubts and fears,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>May</HI> 10.</NOTE> engaging "that they &s;hould have relief and a&s;&s;i&s;tance at the public expen&s;e;" at the &s;ame time a&s;&s;uring them, "that as &s;oon as they were recovered, they &s;hould have free
<PB N="75" REF="028963_0209_0FDDBF0165BD4528">liberty to depart." "This humane line of conduct," &s;ays Dr. Ram&s;ay, was more injurious to the views of the leaders in the American councils, than the &s;everity practi&s;ed by other Briti&s;h commanders. The truly po|litic, as well as humane general Carleton, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the&s;e pri&s;oners, after liberally &s;upplying their wants, with a recommendation, "to go home, mind their farms, and keep them&s;elves and their neighbours from all participation in the unhappy war."</P>
<P>It was during this calamitous &s;tate of affairs that congre&s;s were &s;eriou&s;ly deliberating upon a final &s;epar|ation from Great Britain. And, at length, in the month of July, the declaration of independence was publi&s;hed. A particular account of this momentous tran&s;action will be given hereafter. In the mean time we &s;hall go on with an account of the northern cam|paign.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h general, now freed from any danger of an attack, was &s;oon enabled to act offen&s;ively again&s;t the provincials, by the arrival of the forces de&s;tined for that purpo&s;e from Britain. By the&s;e he was put at the head of about 13,000 men, among whom were tho&s;e of Brun&s;wick. With this force he in&s;tantly &s;et out to the Three Rivers, where he expected that Ar|nold would have made a &s;tand; but he had retired to Sorel, a place 150 miles di&s;tant from Quebeck, where he was at la&s;t met by the reinforcements ordered by con|gre&s;s. Here, though the preceding events were by no means calculated to in&s;pire much military ardour, a very daring enterpri&s;e was undertaken; and this was, to &s;urpri&s;e the Briti&s;h troops po&s;ted here under generals Fra&s;er and Ne&s;bit; of whom the former commanded tho&s;e on land, the latter &s;uch as were on board of tran&s;ports, and were but a little way di&s;tant. The en|terpri&s;e was undoubtedly very hazardous, both on ac|count of the &s;trength of the parties again&s;t whom they

<P>By this di&s;a&s;ter the provincials lo&s;t all hopes of ac|compli&s;hing any thing in Canada. They demoli&s;hed their works, and carried off their artillery with the ut|mo&s;t expedition. They were pur&s;ued, however, by general Burgoyne; again&s;t whom it was expected that they would have collected all their force, and made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> re&s;olute &s;tand. But they were now too much di&s;pirit|ed by misfortune, to make any farther exertions of val|our. On the 18th of June the Briti&s;h gen|eral arrived at Fort St. John's,

It was thought that they would have made &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance at Nut I&s;land, the entrance to Lake Champlain; but this al&s;o they had abandoned, and retreated acro&s;s the lake to Crown Point, whither they could not be immediately followed. Thus was the province of Canada entirely evacuated by the A|mericans; who&s;e lo&s;s in their retreat from Quebeck was not calculated at le&s;s than 1000 men, of whom 400 fell at once into the hands of the enemy at a place called the Cedars, about 50 miles above Montreal, by the bad conduct of colonel Cole and major Butterfield, who e&s;caped de&s;erved puni&s;hment, and were only ca&s;h|iered and di&s;graced. General Sullivan, however, who conducted this retreat after the affair of general Thom|&s;on, had great merit in what he did, and received the thanks of congre&s;s accordingly.</P>
<P>Great numbers of Canadians had taken a decided part with the Americans; and although congre&s;s had a&s;&s;ured them but a few months before, "that they would never abandon them to the fury of their com|mon enemies," the provincial commanders were, from the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e, forced to leave them to the mercy of that government again&s;t which they had of|fended. A &s;hort time before the Americans evacuated Canada, general Arnold was bu&s;ily employed in plun|dering the merchants of Montreal, under pretence of &s;upplying the army. And "his nephew, &s;oon after, opened a &s;tore at Albany, and publicly di&s;po&s;ed of goods which had been procured at Montreal."</P>
<P>General Sullivan left the northern army on the 12th of July, and was &s;ucceeded by general Gates. Gen|eral Sullivan's return of the troops &s;erving in Canada was 7006. It appears that the whole lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by the provincials at Quebeck, Three Rivers, Cedars, the con&s;equent retreat from Canada, together with deaths and de&s;ertions which happened from the fir&s;t of April,

<PB N="79" REF="028963_0211_0FDDBF0467F6C620">from other motives, made no re&s;i&s;tance. Commodore Banks lay a few miles off with his men of war, in &s;ight; and his boats might &s;oon have been up with the &s;hip. The captain of the Hope, &s;en&s;ible of this advan|tage, gave orders to his men to cut the topfail hal|liards and ties. Mugford heard the orders, and knew the con&s;equence of executing them&mdash;that the &s;ailing of the &s;hip would be &s;o long prevented, that the men of war's boats would recover her. He therefore open|ed with a volley of oaths and execrations, and, in the mo&s;t horrid manner, threatened the captain and every man on board with immediate death if the orders were executed, upon which the captain was &s;o terrified as to de&s;i&s;t. After taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his prize, Mugford was joined by two other &s;mall crui&s;ers, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted in carrying her &s;afe through Pudding Point Gut. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">inhabitants of Bo&s;ton, who had been engaged in keep|ing the continental fa&s;t, had, on leaving their re&s;pective places of wor&s;hip in the afternoon, the peculiar plea|&s;ure of &s;eeing in the harbour the mo&s;t valuable prize, on account of the powder, taken &s;ince the commence|ment of the war.</P>
<P>Two days after this exploit, Mugford's crui&s;er and another in company were attacked, when at anchor in Pudding Point Gut, by thirteen boats from the men of war at Nanta&s;ket. The boats were beaten off with the lo&s;s of the brave lieutenant who commanded, and &s;ev|eral of his men; but Mugford, exerting him&s;elf heroic|ally, was killed, and was the only per&s;on lo&s;t on the &s;ide of the American crui&s;ers.</P>
<P>Commodore Banks, omitting to leave crui&s;ers in the bay, after he was forced to leave Nanta&s;ket, afforded an opportunity to the American privateers of taking a number of Highlanders. Three days after his quitting it,

<P>In South Carolina the provincials had a more for|midable enemy to deal with. A &s;quadron, who&s;e ob|ject was the reduction of Charle&s;ton, had been fitted out in December 1775; but by rea&s;on of unfavourable weather did not reach Cape Fear in North Ca|rolina,

<P>On the part of the Briti&s;h, &s;o many delays occur&s;ed, that it was the 28th of June before matters were in readine&s;s for an attack; and by this time the provin|cials had abundantly provided for their reception.

<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>June</HI> 28.</NOTE> and about mid-day the two 50 gun &s;hips and the three 28 gun frigates came up and began a &s;evere fire.

<P>The Americans on this occa&s;ion ju&s;tly boa&s;ted of their heroes. A &s;erjeant, ob&s;erving the flag &s;taff &s;hot away in the beginning of the action, jumped from one of the embra&s;ures upon the beach, took up the flag, and fixing it upon a &s;ponge &s;taff, put it in its proper place, in the mid&s;t of the dreadful fire already men|tioned. For this di&s;tingui&s;hed act of bravery he was pre&s;ented with a &s;word by the congre&s;s.

<P>The thanks of congre&s;s were given to general Lee, and al&s;o to colonels Moultrie and Thom&s;on for their good conduct in this memorable action. In com|pliment to the commanding officer, the fort from that time was called Fort Moultrie.</P>
<P>This year al&s;o, the Americans, having &s;o frequently made trial of their valour by land, became de&s;irous of trying it by &s;ea al&s;o, and of forming a navy that might in &s;ome mea&s;ure be able to protect their trade, and do e&s;&s;ential hurt to the enemy. In the beginning of March, Commodore Hopkins was di&s;patched with two &s;hips, two brigs, and a &s;loop to the Bahama I&s;lands, where he made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the ordnance and military &s;tores; but the gunpowder, which had been the principal object, was removed. On his return he captured &s;everal ve&s;&s;els; but was foiled in his attempt on the Gla&s;gow frigate, which found means to e&s;cape, notwith&s;tanding the efforts of his whole &s;quadron.</P>

The intent of the expedition was to pu&s;h forward, before winter, to Albany, where the army would take up its winter quarters, and next &s;pring ef|fect a junction with that under general Howe, when it was not doubted that the united force and &s;kill of the&s;e two commanders would &s;peedily put a termination to the war.</P>

<P>To oppo&s;e this formidable armament, the Americans had but an incon&s;iderable naval force, under the com|mand of general Arnold. It con&s;i&s;ted of a &s;chooner

That the in&s;titution of kings was the mo&s;t pro&s;perous invention the devil ever &s;et on foot, for the promotion of idolatry. Kings were placed in &s;uch a light, as tended not only to de&s;troy all attachment to them, but, to make them di&s;ta&s;teful, their office was attempted to be ren|dered odious; from whence the tran&s;ition to the royal per&s;on was ea&s;y. Nothing could have been better tim|ed, to accompli&s;h the end in view, than this perform|ance. It was received with applau&s;e; read by almo&s;t every American; and recommended as a work replete with truth, and again&s;t which none but the partial and prejudiced could form any objections. In union with the feelings and &s;entiments of the people, it produced &s;urpri&s;ing effects. It &s;atisfied multitudes that it was their true intere&s;t immediately to cut the gordian knot by which the colonies had been bound to Great Britain, and to open their commerce as an independent people, to all the nations of the world.</P>
<P>The&s;e arguments, re&s;ounding from all quarters, &s;ec|onded by the enmity again&s;t the mother country, which was now bred in the minds of the people, &s;oon decided the matter. The Maryland delegates were in&s;tructed to return to congre&s;s, and act as they found mo&s;t proper for the intere&s;ts of their country. In Penn&s;ylvania it had been fairly debated in their provin|cial a&s;&s;emblies, where it was carried by va&s;t majorities that the delegates &s;hould agree to the determinations of congre&s;s: and John Dickin&s;on, one of the delegates from that province was di&s;placed, becau&s;e he had
<PB N="95" REF="028963_0219_0FDDBF1096748518">&s;poken and voted again&s;t the motion for independency, made in congre&s;s by Richard Henry Lee, of Virginia, on the &s;eventh of June.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t of July, congre&s;s re&s;olved it&s;elf into a committee of the whole, upon the &s;ubject of independ|ency; but neither colonies nor members being unani|mous, it was po&s;tponed till the next day. After a full di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, the mea&s;ure of declaring the colonies free and independent was approved, by nearly an unani|mous vote. And the fourth of July, 1776, announced to the world the erection of this new empire.

<DIV1 TYPE="declaration of independence">
<P>WHEN, in the cour&s;e of human events, it becomes nece&s;&s;ary for one people to di&s;&s;olve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to a&s;|&s;ume among the powers of the earth, the &s;eparate and equal &s;tation to which the laws of nature and of na|ture's God entitle them, a decent re&s;pect to the opin|ions of mankind requires that they &s;hould declare the cau&s;es which impel them to the &s;eparation.</P>
<P>We hold the&s;e truths to be &s;elf evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among the&s;e are life, liberty, and the pur&s;uit of happine&s;s&mdash; that to &s;ecure the&s;e rights, governments are in&s;tituted among men, deriving their ju&s;t powers from the con|&s;ent of the governed; that whenever any form of gov|ernment becomes de&s;tructive of the&s;e ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to aboli&s;h it, and to in&s;titute a new government, laying its foundation on &s;uch princi|ples, and organizing its power in &s;uch form, as to them &s;hall &s;eem mo&s;t likely to effect their &s;afety and happi|ne&s;s.
<PB N="96" REF="028963_0220_0FDDBF12CAE1D7C8">Prudence, indeed, will dictate that government long e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;hould not be changed for light and tran&s;ient cau&s;es; and accordingly all experience had &s;hewn, that mankind are more di&s;po&s;ed to &s;uffer, while evils are &s;ufferable, than to right them&s;elves by aboli&s;h|ing the forms to which they are accu&s;tomed. But when a long train of abu&s;es and u&s;urpations, pur&s;uing invariably the &s;ame object, evinces a de&s;ign to reduce them under ab&s;olute de&s;poti&s;m, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off &s;uch government, and to pro|vide new guards for their future &s;ecurity. Such has been the patient &s;ufferance of the&s;e colonies, and &s;uch is now the nece&s;&s;ity which con&s;trains them to alter their former &s;y&s;tems of government. The hi&s;tory of the pre&s;ent king of Great Britain is a hi&s;tory or repeated injuries and u&s;urpations, all having in direct object the e&s;tabli&s;hment of an ab&s;olute tyranny over the&s;e &s;tates. To prove this, let facts be &s;ubmitted to a candid world.</P>
<P>He has refu&s;ed his a&s;&s;ent to laws, the mo&s;t whole|&s;ome and nece&s;&s;ary for the public good.</P>
<P>He has forbidden his governours to pa&s;s laws <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> immediate and pre&s;&s;ing importance, unle&s;s &s;u&s;pended in their operation till his a&s;&s;ent &s;hould be obtained; and when &s;o &s;u&s;pended he has utterly neglected to attend to them.</P>
<P>He has refu&s;ed to pa&s;s other laws for the accom|modation of large di&s;tricts of people, unle&s;s tho&s;e peo|ple would relinqui&s;h the right of repre&s;entation in the legi&s;lature, a right ine&s;timable to them, and formidable to tyrants only.</P>
<P>He has called together legi&s;lative bodies at places unu&s;ual, uncomfortable, and di&s;tant from the depo&s;i|tory of their public records, for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of fa|tiguing them into compliance with his mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>He has di&s;&s;olved repre&s;entative hou&s;es repeatedly,
<PB N="97" REF="028963_0220_0FDDBF12CAE1D7C8">for oppo&s;ing, with manly firmne&s;s, his inva&s;ions on the rights of the people.</P>
<P>He has refu&s;ed, for a long time after &s;uch di&s;&s;olu|tions, to cau&s;e others to be elected; whereby the le|gi&s;lative powers, incapable of annihilation, have return|ed to the people at large for their exerci&s;e; the &s;tate remaining in the mean time expo&s;ed to all the danger of inva&s;ion from without, and convul&s;ions within.</P>
<P>He has endeavoured to prevent the population of the&s;e &s;tates; for that purpo&s;e ob&s;tructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners; refu&s;ing to pa&s;s others to encourage their migration hither, and rai&s;ing the con|ditions of new appropriations of lands.</P>
<P>He has ob&s;tructed the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, by refu&s;ing his a&s;&s;ent to laws for e&s;tabli&s;hing judiciary powers.</P>
<P>He has made judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their &s;alaries.</P>
<P>He has erected a multitude of new offices, and &s;ent hither &s;warms of officers to hara&s;s our people, and eat out their &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>He has kept among us, in times of peace, &s;tanding armies, without the con&s;ent of our legi&s;latures.</P>
<P>He has affected to render the military independ|ent of, and &s;uperior to, the civil power.</P>
<P>He has combined with others to &s;ubject us to a juri&s;diction foreign to our con&s;titution, and unacknowl|edged by our laws; giving his a&s;&s;ent to their acts of pretended legi&s;lation:</P>
<P>For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:</P>
<P>For protecting them, by a mock trial, from pun|i&s;hment for any murders which they &s;hould commit on the inhabitants of the&s;e &s;tates:</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="028963_0221_0FDDBF1371756850">
For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world:</P>
<P>For impo&s;ing taxes on us without our con&s;ent:</P>
<P>For depriving us, in many ca&s;es, of the benefits of trial by jury:</P>
<P>For tran&s;porting us beyond &s;eas to be tried for pretended offences:</P>
<P>For aboli&s;hing the free &s;y&s;tem of Engli&s;h laws in a neighbouring province, e&s;tabli&s;hing therein an arbi|trary government, and enlarging its boundaries, &s;o as to render it at once an example and fit in&s;trument for introducing the &s;ame ab&s;olute rule into the&s;e colonies:</P>
<P>For taking away our charters, aboli&s;hing our mo&s;t valuable laws, and altering fundamentally the forms of our governments:</P>
<P>For &s;u&s;pending our own legi&s;latures, and declaring them&s;elves inve&s;ted with power to legi&s;late for us in all ca&s;es what&s;oever.</P>
<P>He has abdicated government here, by declaring us out of his protection, and waging war again&s;t us.</P>
<P>He has plundered our &s;eas, ravaged our coa&s;ts, burnt our towns, and de&s;troyed the lives of our people.</P>
<P>He is, at this time, tran&s;porting large armies of foreign mercenaries to complete the works of death, de&s;olation and tyranny, already begun with circum|&s;tances of cruelty and per&s;idy, &s;carcely paralleled in the mo&s;t barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation.</P>
<P>He has con&s;trained our fellow citizens, taken cap|tive on the high &s;eas, to bear arms again&s;t their country, to become the executioners of their friends and breth|ren, or to fall them&s;elves by their hands.</P>
<P>He has excited dome&s;tic in&s;urrections among&s;t us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the mercile&s;s Indian &s;avages, who&s;e known
<PB N="99" REF="028963_0221_0FDDBF1371756850">rule of warfare is an undi&s;tingui&s;hed de&s;truction of all ages, &s;exes and conditions.</P>
<P>In every &s;tage of the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ions, we have peti|tioned for redre&s;s in the mo&s;t humble terms: our re|peated po&s;itions have been an&s;wered only by repeated injury. A prince, who&s;e character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.</P>
<P>Nor have we been wanting in attention to our Brit|i&s;h brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts made by their legi&s;lature, to extend an unwarrantable juri&s;diction over us. We have re|minded them of the circum&s;tances of our emigration and &s;ettlement here. We have appealed to their na|tive ju&s;tice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them, by the ties of our common kindred, to di&s;avow the&s;e u&s;urpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and corre&s;pondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of ju&s;tice and of con&s;anguinity. We mu&s;t, therefore, acquie&s;ce in the nece&s;&s;ity, which denounces our &s;eparation, and hold them, as we hold the re&s;t of mankind, enemies in war, in peace, friends.</P>
<P>We, therefore, the repre&s;entatives of the United States of America, in General Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled, ap|pealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rec|titude of our intentions, do, in the name, and by authority of the good people of the&s;e colonies, &s;olemnly publi&s;h and declare, that the&s;e United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, FREE and INDEPENDENT STATES; that they are ab&s;olved from all allegiance to the Briti&s;h crown; and that all political connection between them and the &s;tate of Great Britain is and ought to be totally di&s;&s;olved; and that, as free and in|dependent &s;tates, they have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, e&s;tabli&s;h commerce, and to do all other acts and things which independent
<PB N="100" REF="028963_0222_0FDDBF14EC305120">&s;tates may of right do. And for the &s;upport of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our &s;acred honour.</P>

<P>On the 8th of July, at twelve o'clock, the declaration of independence was proclaimed at the &s;tate-hou&s;e in Philadelphia, amid&s;t the greate&s;t acclamations. The next day, in con&s;equence of general orders, it was read at the head of each brigade of the continental army at New York, and every where received with loud huz|zas, and the utmo&s;t demon&s;trations of joy. The &s;ame evening, the eque&s;trian &s;tatue of the king was laid pro&s;trate on the ground, and the lead of which it was made was doomed to be run into bullets.</P>
<P>The declaration of independence was made at a time when no royal governour had even the &s;hadow of au|thority in any of the colonies; and when no Briti&s;h troops had any footing in the United States. A for|midable force was indeed collected on the coa&s;ts ready for inva&s;ion, and in face of that armament this deci&s;ive &s;tep was taken. The Americans now knew the ground on which they &s;tood, and every thing a&s;&s;umed a new appearance. The &s;ophi&s;tical di&s;tinctions between the limits of authority on the one &s;ide, and of liberty on the other, were done away. Every per&s;on was now able to form his own judgment; the que&s;tion being &s;imply whether America &s;hould be conquered or inde|pendent.</P>
<P>The in&s;titution of new forms of government began
<PB N="102" REF="028963_0223_0FDDBF167968A3D8">to take place in the different &s;tates, as had been recom|mended by congre&s;s, in the month of May this year. Although the kingly office was aboli&s;hed, yet, in mo&s;t of the &s;ubordinate departments of government, ancient forms and names were retained. Each &s;tate appointed a &s;upreme executive head, with the title of governour or pre&s;ident. They agreed, likewi&s;e, in deriving the whole powers of government, either mediately or im|mediately from the people.</P>
<P>As a farther &s;ecurity for the continuance of republi|can principles, in the American con&s;titutions, they agreed in prohibiting any hereditary honours and di&s;|tinction of ranks. All religious e&s;tabli&s;hments w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> aboli&s;hed. Some retained a con&s;titutional di&s;tinction between Chri&s;tians and others, with re&s;pect to eligibili|ty to office, but the idea of &s;upporting one denomina|tion at the expen&s;e of others, or of rai&s;ing any one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of Prote&s;tants to a legal preeminence, was univer&s;ally reprobated. The alliance between Church and State was completely broken, and each was left to &s;upport it|&s;elf independent of the other. It was &s;ixteen months after this time, before the plan of confederation was &s;o far dige&s;ted as to be ready for communication to the &s;tates. Nor was it ratified by all the &s;tates till nearly three years more had elap&s;ed.</P>
<P>Many difficulties occurred in &s;ettling the rational contributions from each &s;tate. The value of lands <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> finally fixed upon as the criterion. The repre&s;entati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of the &s;tates was not &s;o ea&s;ily &s;ettled, but the large &s;tates yielded the point, for the pre&s;ent, and con&s;ent|ed that each &s;tate &s;hould have an equal &s;uffrage; being fearful of weakening their exertions again&s;t the com|mon enemy.</P>
<P>As a radical change of the whole &s;y&s;tem of the fir&s;t con&s;titution took place a few years after the termination of the war, it is neither nece&s;&s;ary nor con&s;i&s;tent with
<PB N="103" REF="028963_0223_0FDDBF167968A3D8">the limits of this work to give any account of it. Suffice it to &s;ay, that it an&s;wered the purpo&s;e of the times, "when the citizens of America were young in the &s;cience of politics, and when a commanding &s;en&s;e of duty, enforced by the pre&s;&s;ure of a common danger, precluded the nece&s;&s;ity of a power of compul&s;ion."</P>
<P>It is amu&s;ing to recollect, at this di&s;tance of time, that one effect of independence was an aver&s;ion to every thing which bore the name and marks of royalty. Sign boards on which were painted the king's arms, or the crown and &s;ceptre, or the portraits of any branches of the royal family, were pulled down or defaced. Pic|tures and e&s;cutcheons of the &s;ame kind in private hou&s;|es were inverted or concealed. The names of &s;treets, which had been called after a king or queen were al|tered; and the half pence, which bore the name of George III. were either refu&s;ed in payment, or degrad|ed to farthings. The&s;e la&s;t have not yet recovered their value.</P>
<P>It was not long before the con&s;tancy both of the rul|ers and &s;ubjects of the new empire were to undergo a &s;evere trial. Hitherto they had been upon the whole &s;ucce&s;sful in their operations: but now they were doom|ed to experience misfortune, mi&s;ery, and di&s;appoint|ment; the enemy over-running their country, and their own armies not able to face them in the field. Imme|diately after the repul&s;e the Briti&s;h had &s;u&s;tained at Charle&s;ton, they appeared off New York, with a for|midable armament. This was compo&s;ed of the fleet and army which had left Bo&s;ton, along with the new rai&s;ed forces in Britain, and 13,000 He&s;&s;ians and Wal|deckers. The whole number de&s;tined to act on this occa&s;ion was not le&s;s than 35,000 men; though all the&s;e never were at any time brought into one engage|ment. Such a force, however, had never before ap|peared in any part of America; nor was it perhaps
<PB N="104" REF="028963_0224_0FDDBF8550A72348">ever exceeded by any European army of equal number, whether we con&s;ider the goodne&s;s of the troops, the abundant provi&s;ion of all manner of military &s;tores and materials, or the excellence and number of artillery of all kinds. It was be&s;ides &s;upported by a very numer|ous fleet, well adapted for the &s;ervice, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ix &s;hips of the line, thirty frigates, be&s;ides other armed ve&s;&s;els, and a va&s;t number of tran&s;ports. The fleet was commanded by lord Howe, and the land forces by his br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">her general Howe, men of approved valour and experience, who had already &s;ignalized them&s;elves in the &s;ervice of their country. General Howe, a con&s;id|erable time before his brother arrived, had &s;et &s;ail from Halifax, and lay before New York, but without at|tempting to commence ho&s;tilities until he &s;hould be joined by his brother. The Americans had, according to cu&s;tom,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>June</HI> 25.</NOTE> fortified New York and the adjacent i&s;lands in an extra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|dinary manner. However, general Howe was &s;uffered to land his troops on Staten I&s;land, where he was &s;oon joined by a number of the inhabitants. About the middle of July,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>July</HI> 14.</NOTE> lord Howe arrived with the grand arma|ment; and being one of the commi&s;&s;ioners appointed to receive the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the coloni&s;ts, he publi&s;hed a circular letter to this purpo&s;e to the &s;everal governours who had been expelled from their provinc|es, de&s;iring them to make the extent of his commi&s;&s;ion, and the powers he was inve&s;ted with by parliament, as public as po&s;&s;ible. Here, however, congre&s;s &s;aved him trouble, by ordering his letter and declaration to he publi&s;hed in all the new&s;papers, "That every one might &s;ee the in&s;idiou&s;ne&s;s of the Briti&s;h mini&s;try, and that they had nothing to tru&s;t to be&s;ides the exertion of their own valour."</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="028963_0224_0FDDBF8550A72348">
Lord Howe next &s;ent a letter to general Wa&s;hing|ton; but as it was directed "To George Wa&s;hington, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR>" the general refu&s;ed to accept of it, as not being directed in the &s;tyle &s;uitable to his &s;tation. To obviate this objection, adjutant general Patter&s;on was &s;ent with another letter, directed "To George Wa&s;hing|ton, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c." But though a very polite recep|tion was given to the bearer, general Wa&s;hington ut|terly refu&s;ed the letter; nor could any explanation of the adjutant induce him to accept of it. The only intere&s;ting part of the conver&s;ation was that relating to the powers of the commi&s;&s;ioners, of whom lord Howe was one. The adjutant told him, that the&s;e powers were very exten&s;ive: that the commi&s;&s;ioners were de|termined to exert them&s;elves to the utmo&s;t, in order to bring about a reconciliation; and that he hoped the general would con&s;ider this vi&s;it as a &s;tep towards it. General Wa&s;hington replied, that it did not appear that the&s;e powers con&s;i&s;ted in any thing el&s;e than granting pardons; and as America had committed no offence, &s;he a&s;ked no forgivene&s;s, and was only defending her unque&s;tionable rights. Two days before adjutant gen|eral Pater&s;on had the above-mentioned interview, in|dependence was &s;olemnly proclaimed by the civil authority, as if in defiance of all the then formidable appearances: after which, the king's arms, and an elegant picture of his maje&s;ty, were de&s;troyed. Upon tho&s;e proceedings, the epi&s;copal clergy &s;hut up their churches.</P>
<P>The whole continental army in and near New York, at this critical period,

This victory, though complete, was very far from being &s;o deci&s;ive as the congre&s;s imagined.

But the congre&s;s were not &s;o humbled as to derogate in the lea&s;t from the dignity of character they had a&s;&s;umed. They replied, that the congre&s;s of the free and independent &s;tates of America could not con&s;i&s;tently &s;end any of its members in another capaci|ty than that which they had publicly a&s;&s;umed; but as they were extremely de&s;irous of re&s;toring peace to their country upon equitable conditions, they would appoint a committee of their body to wait upon him, and learn what propo&s;als he had to make.</P>
<P>This produced a new conference. The committee appointed by congre&s;s was compo&s;ed of Dr. Franklin, Mr. Adams, and Mr. Rutledge. They were very po|litely received by his Lord&s;hip; but the conference proved as fruitle&s;s as before independency had been declared; and the final an&s;wer of the deputies was, that they were extremely willing to enter into any treaty with Great Britain that might conduce to the good of both nations, but that they would not treat in any other character than that of independent &s;tates. This po&s;itive declaration in&s;tantly put an end to all hopes of reconciliation; and it was re&s;olved to pro&s;e|cute the war with the utmo&s;t vigour.</P>

In this, the Briti&s;h general met with complete &s;ucce&s;s. The Americans, on the approach of the king's forces, retreated from King's Bridge into Fort Wa&s;hington, which, being attacked in four different places at once, was quickly reduced. The number of pri&s;oners in the fort, and taken in lines, amounted to about 3000.

The lo&s;s of the Briti&s;h, inclu&s;ive of killed and wounded, was about 1200.

On the 7th of December, lord Cornwallis's corps marched to Princeton, which the Americans quitted the &s;ame day. The pur&s;uit was followed &s;o clo&s;e, that the Briti&s;h reached the Delaware,

<P>Thus the Jer&s;ies were laid entirely open to the in|cur&s;ions of the Briti&s;h troops, and &s;o fully were the&s;e provinces taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of by the royal army, that its winter quarters extended from New Brun&s;wick to the river Delaware: and nothing could have prevented Philadelphia falling into their hands, had they had boats to have tran&s;ported their army.

His army was divided into three bodies; one of which he ordered to cro&s;s the Delaware at Trenton Ferry, a little below the town: the &s;econd at a good di&s;tance below, at a place called <HI>Bordentown,</HI> where the &s;econd divi&s;ion of He&s;&s;ians was placed; whil&s;t he him&s;elf, with the third, directing his cour&s;e to a ferry &s;ome miles above Trenton, intended to have pa&s;&s;ed it at midnight, and attack the He&s;&s;ians at break of day. But by rea&s;on of various impediments, it was eight in the morning be|fore he could reach the place of his de&s;tination. The enemy, however, did not perceive his approach till they were &s;uddenly attacked. Colonel Ralle, who com|manded them, did all that could be expected from a brave and experienced officer; but every thing was in &s;uch confu&s;ion, that no efforts of valour or &s;kill could now retrieve matters. The colonel him&s;elf was mor|tally wounded, his troops were entirely broken, their artillery &s;eized, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ix pieces of bra&s;s cannon; and 23 He&s;&s;ian officers, and 886 of the &s;ame nation taken pri&s;oners. About 600 only e&s;caped by the road leading to Bordentown. After this gallant exploit, gen|eral Wa&s;hington again returned into Penn&s;ylvania.</P>
<P>This action, though &s;eemingly of no very deci&s;ive na|ture, was &s;ufficient at that time to turn the fortune of wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in favour of America.

Neither force, di&s;tre&s;s, artifice, or per&s;ua&s;ion, had yet influenced congre&s;s to entertain the mo&s;t di&s;tant idea of purcha&s;ing peace, by returning to the condition of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects. However, affairs appeared &s;o de&s;|perate about this time, that &s;ome members, di&s;tru&s;tful of their ability to re&s;i&s;t the power of Great Britain, propo&s;ed to authori&s;e their commi&s;&s;ioners at the court of France to transfer to that country the &s;ame monop|oly of their trade, which Great Britain had hitherto enjoyed. But upon mature con&s;ideration, every pro|po&s;al of conce&s;&s;ion was rejected. The more enlight|ened members ob&s;erved, that, "Though the friend&s;hip of &s;mall &s;tates might be purcha&s;ed, that of France could not." It was therefore &s;uppo&s;ed, that the only mea&s;ure, likely to induce France to an interference, would be an adherence to their former re&s;olution of independence, and proffered freedom of trade to all nations. This they re&s;olved to do, tru&s;ting the event to Providence, and ri&s;king all con&s;equences. Copies of their re&s;olutions to this effect were &s;ent to the princi|pal courts of Europe. The&s;e di&s;patches fell into the hands of the Briti&s;h, who made no other u&s;e of them than publi&s;hing them to the world; which was the ve|ry thing congre&s;s wi&s;hed for.</P>
<P>On the 27th of December, the congre&s;s inve&s;ted general Wa&s;hington with almo&s;t dictatorial power throughout the United States,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dec.</HI> 27.</NOTE> for the limited term of &s;ix months, unle&s;s &s;ooner determined by their authority.

<P>Reinforcements came in from &s;everal quarters to gen|eral Wa&s;hington, &s;o that he was &s;oon in a condition once more to pa&s;s the Delaware, and take up his quar|ters at Trenton, where he was emboldened to maintain his &s;tation, notwith&s;tanding the accounts that were re|ceived of the enemy's rapid advance towards him. Lord Cornwallis, accordingly, made his appearance in full force; and, on the evening of his arrival, the lit|tle town of Trenton contained the two ho&s;tile armies, &s;eparated only by a &s;mall creek, which was fordable in many places. This was, indeed, the cri&s;is of the A|merican revolution; and had his lord&s;hip made an im|mediate attack, in pur&s;uance of what is reported to have been the advice of &s;ir William Er&s;kine, general Wa&s;h|ington's defeat &s;eems to have been inevitable: but a night's delay turned the fate of the war, and produced an enterpri&s;e, the magnitude and glory of which, can only be equalled by its &s;ucce&s;s. General Wa&s;hington having called a council of war, &s;tated the calam|itous &s;ituation to which his army was reduced;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1777. <HI>Jan.</HI> 2.</NOTE> and having heard the various opinions of his offi|cers, finally propo&s;ed a circuitous march to Princeton, as the means of avoiding, at once, the imputation of a retreat, and the danger of a battle, with numbers &s;o inferior, and in a &s;ituation &s;o ineligible. The idea was unanimou&s;ly ap|proved; and, as &s;oon as it was dark, the nece&s;&s;ary mea|&s;ures were taken for accompli&s;hing it. A line of fires was kindled, which &s;erved to give light to the Ameri|cans, whil&s;t it ob&s;cured them from the ob&s;ervation of the enemy: and by a providential interpo&s;ition, the
<PB N="127" REF="028963_0235_0FDDBF34BB8624D8">weather, which had been for &s;ome time pa&s;t warm, moi&s;t, and foggy, &s;uddenly changed to a hard fro&s;t; and, in a moment, as it were, rendered the road, which had been deep and heavy, firm and &s;mooth as a pavement.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1777. <HI>Jan.</HI> 3.</NOTE> At break of day general Wa&s;hington arriving near Princeton would have completely &s;urpri&s;ed the Briti&s;h, had not a party, which was on their way to Trenton, de&s;|cried his troops when they were about two miles di&s;tant, and &s;ent back couriers to alarm their un&s;u&s;pecting fel|low &s;oldiers in their rear. The&s;e con&s;i&s;ted of the 17th, the 40th, and 55th regiments of Briti&s;h infantry, and &s;ome of the royal artillery, with two field pieces, and three troops of light dragoons. The centre of the A|mericans, con&s;i&s;ting of the Philadelphia militia, whil&s;t on their line of march, was bri&s;kly charged by a party of the Briti&s;h, and gave way in di&s;order. The moment was critical. General Wa&s;hington pu&s;hed forward, and placed him&s;elf between his own men, and the Brit|i&s;h, with his hor&s;e's head fronting the latter. The A|mericans, encouraged by his example, and exhortations, made a &s;tand, and returned the Briti&s;h fire. The gen|eral, though between both parties, was providentially uninjured by either. A party of the Briti&s;h fled into the college and were there attacked with field pieces which were fired into it. The &s;eat of the mu&s;es became for &s;ome time the &s;cene of action. The party which had taken refuge in the college, after receiving a few di&s;charges from the American field pieces, came out and &s;urrendered them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war. In the cour&s;e of the engagement, &s;ixty of the Briti&s;h were killed, and a greater number wounded, and about 300 of them were taken pri&s;oners. The re&s;t made their e&s;cape, &s;ome by pu&s;hing on towards Trenton, others by returning towards Brun&s;wick. The Americans lo&s;t only a few, but colonels Ha&s;let and Potter, and captain
<PB N="128" REF="028963_0236_0FDDBF3634C2B6C0">Neal of the artillery, were among the &s;lain. General Mercer received three bayonet wounds, of which he died in a &s;hort time. He was a Scotchman by birth, but from principle and affection had engaged to &s;upport the liberties of his adopted country, with a zeal equal to that of any of its native &s;ons. In private life he was amiable, and his character as an officer &s;tood high in the public e&s;teem.</P>
<P>During the action in Princeton, the Briti&s;h in Tren|ton were under arms, and on the point of making an a&s;&s;ault on the evacuated camp of the Americans. With &s;o much addre&s;s had general Wa&s;hington moved com|pletely off the ground with his whole force, &s;tores, bag|gage, and artillery, unknown to, and un&s;u&s;pected by his adver&s;aries.</P>
<P>That part of the royal army, which having e&s;caped from Princeton, retreated towards New Brun&s;wick, was pur&s;ued for three or four miles. Another party, which had advanced as far as Maidenhead, on their way to Trenton, hearing the frequent di&s;charge of &s;mall arms in their rear, wheeled round, and marched to the aid of their companions. The Americans, by de&s;troying bridges, retarded the&s;e, though clo&s;e in their rear, &s;o long as to gain time to them&s;elves to move off, in good order, to Plukemin.</P>
<P>Affairs now a&s;&s;umed a different a&s;pect. Lord Corn|wallis found it nece&s;&s;ary to return from the Delaware, to the defence of the magazines at Brun&s;wick. The provincials &s;till avoided any deci&s;ive action; but, in a few days over-ran both the Jer&s;ies and became ma&s;ters of the coa&s;t oppo&s;ite Staten I&s;land, at the &s;ame time that their principal po&s;ts were cho&s;en with &s;uch judg|ment, that it never was found practicable to di&s;lodge them. The royal army retained only the two po&s;ts of Brun&s;wick and Amboy, both holding communication by &s;ea with New York. In th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e the army under lord
<PB N="129" REF="028963_0236_0FDDBF3634C2B6C0">Cornwallis continued during the whole winter very much &s;traitened, the troops undergoing the hard&s;hips of a &s;evere and ince&s;&s;ant duty, whil&s;t their numbers were thinned by a continued &s;eries of &s;kirmi&s;hes, pro|ductive of little advantage on either &s;ide, farther than inuring the Americans to military &s;ervice, and weaken|ing the royal army, who&s;e numbers could not be replac|ed with the &s;ame ea&s;e as the provincials.</P>
<P>The bad effects of the late di&s;orderly conduct of the royal army were now mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly felt. The &s;oldiers, particularly the He&s;&s;ians, had given full &s;cope to the &s;elfi&s;h and ferocious pa&s;&s;ions of human nature. The inhabitants were cruelly plundered, and in particular in&s;tances rapes and murders were committed. Such, in all ages, has been the complexion of the bulk of ar|mies, that immediate and &s;evere puni&s;hments are indi&s;|pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to keep them from flagrant enormi|ties. But it is certain that the&s;e culprits, in mo&s;t in|&s;tances, eluded puni&s;hment; either from the relaxation of di&s;cipline, or the want of due proof to lead to con|viction. The whole province now joined as one man, to revenge their former injuries. Every load of forage and every article of provi&s;ion which did not come from New York, was purcha&s;ed at the price of blood. So ho&s;tile was the province now become, that &s;uch as were incapable of bearing arms acted as &s;pies, and watched continually for tho&s;e who bore them. Thus the Briti&s;h were con&s;trained to act with as much circum&s;pection as if they had been be&s;ieged by a victorious army, in|&s;tead of being them&s;elves the conquerors. The char|acter of general Wa&s;hington was exalted to the highe&s;t pitch among his countrymen, and in Europe he was held in &s;uch e&s;timation, as to be &s;tiled the American Fabius, from the famous Roman general of that name, who defended his country again&s;t Hannibal with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="028963_0237_0FDDBF376F970B60">
For the cau&s;e of the decline of the Briti&s;h affairs, no fault was ever alleged, with the &s;malle&s;t &s;hew of rea&s;on, on the part of the generats or the troops they com|manded, except the di&s;orderly conduct of the &s;oldiers already mentioned; and which, from the employment of the He&s;&s;ians in the &s;ervice originally, &s;eemed to be altogether unavoidable. The &s;everity and inhumanity exerci&s;ed towards the American pri&s;oners in New York, operated powerfully again&s;t the royal cau&s;e. General Gates was heard to &s;ay, "Had general Howe &s;een to it, that the pri&s;oners, and Jer&s;ey inhabitants, when &s;ubdued, had been treated with as much humanity and kindne&s;s as general Carleton exerci&s;ed towards his pri&s;oners, it would have been all over with the A|mericans."</P>
<P>Many other cau&s;es, however, concurred to retard the progre&s;s of their arms, during the whole cour&s;e of the war. Among the&s;e the principal may be &s;uppo&s;ed to ari&s;e from the va&s;t extent of the American continent, with its uncommon divi&s;ion into large tracts of terri|tory, &s;ome cultivated, and others in a &s;tate of nature; the great length of &s;ea coa&s;t in its front, and the im|men&s;e wa&s;tes at the back of the inhabited countries, affording &s;helter to the provincials in all po&s;&s;ible circum|&s;tances; the numberle&s;s impregnable po&s;ts, and natural barriers, formed by the various combinations of woods, mountains, lakes, and mar&s;hes. Added to the&s;e, the Briti&s;h found, to their co&s;t, the unanimity of the colo|nies, and the judicious application of their &s;trength, by &s;uiting the defence of the country, to the nature, ge|nius and ability of the people, as well as to the natural advantages of the country it&s;elf; thereby rendering pitched battles u&s;ele&s;s, and con&s;ining the operations of war entirely to the defence of po&s;ts, making &s;urpri&s;es, and fighting &s;kirmi&s;hes. Add to this al&s;o, that the people were unfettered by &s;trong cities; &s;o that the re|duction
<PB N="131" REF="028963_0237_0FDDBF376F970B60">of the capital of a province had little or no ef|fect upon the re&s;t; and the army could retain no more territory than that which it immediately occupied, which was again lo&s;t as &s;oon as it departed to another quarter.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h likewi&s;e found the unanimity of the col|onies, in the fidelity of their adver&s;aries to one anoth|er. They very &s;eldom had true information of the &s;ituation of affairs either in the American camps or councils: And perhaps this was not one of the lea&s;t cau&s;es of the frequent failure of their enterpri&s;es. Very few in&s;tances occurred, e&s;pecially in the fir&s;t years of the war, of any of the provincial &s;oldiers de&s;erting to the Briti&s;h. Tho&s;e who de&s;erted, generally went to their own homes or el&s;ewhere into the country; where|as, on the other hand, numbers de&s;erted to the provin|cials, and carried with them &s;uch intelligence as pro|cured them a favourable reception.</P>
<P>During the cour&s;e of this campaign, attempts were made to &s;tir up the Indians to make an attack on the back parts of the &s;outhern colonies. They were now informed, that a Briti&s;h force was to land in We&s;t Flor|ida; and after penetrating through the countries of the Creek, Chicke&s;aw, and Cherokee Indians, where they expected to be joined by the warriors of all the&s;e na|tions, were to attack the Carolinas and Virginia; whil&s;t another formidable armament, both of &s;ea and land forces, was to make a powerful impre&s;&s;ion on the coa&s;ts of the&s;e provinces. Circular letters to the &s;ame pur|po&s;e were di&s;tributed by a Mr. Stewart, principal agent for Indian affairs, among the back &s;ettlers, requiring them to repair to the royal &s;tandard as &s;oon as it &s;hould be erected in the country of the Cherokees, &s;etting forth the plan of operations, and demanding &s;ub&s;crip|tion to a written declaration of their allegiance, that
<PB N="132" REF="028963_0238_0FDDBF38F6F74618">they might be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the enemies to the royal cau&s;e.</P>
<P>With this propo&s;al, the natural avarice, levity of temper and natural di&s;po&s;ition of the Indians, induced them to comply. Even the Six Nations, who had for|merly agreed to the ob&s;ervance of a &s;trict neutrality, now joined the general confederacy, and committed &s;ome acts of ho&s;tility, which, however, were afterwards di&s;owned by their chiefs. The Creeks began the war in the &s;outhern parts with all that violence and barbar|ity which di&s;tingui&s;hes American &s;avages; but finding them&s;elves not &s;upported as had been promi&s;ed, they &s;uddenly &s;topped &s;hort, excu&s;ed them&s;elves as well as they could to the congre&s;s, and refu&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Cherokees, who applied to them for that purpo&s;e. The latter were then left to carry on the war alone, which they did for a &s;hort time with the utmo&s;t fury and barbarity. The perpetrators were, however, &s;oon checked, and their cruelties fully retaliated. The mi|litia of the adjacent provinces a&s;&s;embled, marched into the country of the Cherokees, and not only defeated them in every encounter, but demoli&s;hed their towns, de&s;troyed their corn, and killed &s;uch numbers, that the nation being nearly exterminated, the wretched &s;urviv|ors were glad to accept a peace upon any terms the victors cho&s;e to pre&s;cribe; none of the neighbouring nations daring to interpo&s;e in their behalf.</P>
<P>Thus ended, at pre&s;ent, all hopes from the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Indians. The effects of this expedition were exceedingly prejudicial to the royal cau&s;e, as it not only excited the utmo&s;t rancour of the Americans who had revolted, but even the well affected to the Briti&s;h government them&s;elves. Such as had on this occa&s;ion declared for the cau&s;e of Britain, not only to a man expre&s;&s;ed their abhorrence of &s;uch cruel mea&s;ures, but &s;ome of their chief leaders are &s;aid to have avow|ed
<PB N="133" REF="028963_0238_0FDDBF38F6F74618">a recantation of their principles upon that very account.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e tran&s;actions were going forward in America,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1776.</NOTE> the people of Britain remained in a &s;tate of torpid indifference, expecting daily to hear of the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the colonies, from the &s;plendid accounts of conque&s;t exhibited in the new&s;|papers, and the idea of the extreme imbecility of the Americans, which had been &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly propagat|ed and kept up. The high language of authority, dignity and &s;upremacy, which had filled the mouths of many for &s;ome years, fed the vanity of tho&s;e who could not ea&s;ily define, or who perhaps had never fully con&s;idered, the extent of the terms, or of the con&s;e|quences which they were capable of producing; and the flattering idea of le&s;&s;ening the national burdens by an American revenue, whil&s;t it was fitted to the com|prehen&s;ion of the meane&s;t capacity, was not le&s;s ef|fective in its operation upon tho&s;e of a &s;uperior cla&s;s and order. To the powerful principles of national pride and avarice, was added a laudable di&s;po&s;ition to &s;upport tho&s;e national rights which were &s;uppo&s;ed to be invaded, and a proper indignation and re&s;entment to that ingratitude and in&s;olence which were charged upon the Americans, and to which only the pre&s;ent troubles were attributed, by tho&s;e who were mo&s;t active in fomenting the principles of ho&s;tility, which at that time prevailed, far more than they had done at the beginning of this conte&s;t.</P>
<P>In &s;uch circum&s;tances it is not to be wondered at, if a majority of the people gave at lea&s;t a kind of tacit approbation to the war; but as it was not attended with national antipathy or rival&s;hip, e&s;tabli&s;hed enmity, or even a pre&s;ent competition for glory, they did not feel them&s;elves &s;o much intere&s;ted in its &s;ucce&s;s, or al|together &s;o anxious about its con&s;equence, as they
<PB N="134" REF="028963_0239_0FDDBF3A5D81A278">would in tho&s;e of another nature. On the other hand, that great body of the people, who had at all times reprobated the mea&s;ures which led to the pre&s;ent troubles, and who con&s;idered them as not le&s;s danger|ous to the con&s;titution than ruinous to the power and glory of the nation, could not be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;anguine in their wi&s;hes for a &s;ucce&s;s which they dreaded as liable to more fatal con&s;equences than any lo&s;s or defeat. The great di&s;tance of the &s;eat of war, al&s;o rendered its ef|fects le&s;s intere&s;ting. For di&s;tance produces in &s;ome degree the effect of time with re&s;pect to &s;en&s;ibility; and the &s;laughter, cruelties, and calamities, which would wring the heart, if they happened in the next county, are &s;lightly felt at three or four thou&s;and miles di&s;tance. The di&s;tance al&s;o prevented all apprehen&s;ion of imme|diate danger; the expen&s;es of the conte&s;t were not yet &s;en&s;ibly felt; and the bulk of mankind never think of remote con&s;equences. For when, at length, the American privateers not only &s;coured the Atlantic ocean, but &s;preading their depredations through the European &s;eas, brought alarm to the coa&s;t of Britain; when the de&s;truction which befel the homeward bound richly laden We&s;t India fleets, poured equal ruin upon the planters in the i&s;lands and the merchants at home; when an account of the failure of &s;ome capital hou&s;e was almo&s;t the news of every morning; even in that &s;tate of public lo&s;s and private di&s;tre&s;s, an un|u&s;ual phlegm prevailed, and the &s;ame tranquil counte|nance and carele&s;s unconcern was pre&s;erved, by tho&s;e who had not partaken of the calamity. A circum&s;tance which is not &s;ufficiently accounted for, even from the va&s;t numbers who thought them&s;elves officially, or by connexion or principle bound to give countenance to the war, nor the great number of tho&s;e who profited by its continuance.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="028963_0239_0FDDBF3A5D81A278">
Towards the end of the year 1776, the French and Spaniards began to &s;hew a &s;trong attachment to the Americans. The continental privateers appeared in great numbers in their ports, and the prizes they car|ried in were &s;old openly, and without di&s;gui&s;e. The Briti&s;h court did not think it prudent at that time to pu&s;h matters to extremities with the hou&s;e of Bourbon; they, therefore, only made remon&s;trances; the only effect of the&s;e was, that &s;ales were made le&s;s openly. In the We&s;t Indies, however, the depredations were carried on to a much greater extent than in Europe, and avowedly patroni&s;ed by all the French colonies. Even French &s;hips took out American commi&s;&s;ions; and, with a few, or &s;ometimes even no American &s;ail|ors on board, made war on the Briti&s;h trade with im|punity. Letters of marque and repri&s;al were not granted again&s;t the inhabitants of the colonies until the &s;pring of the year 1777; but the Briti&s;h &s;hips of war took a va&s;t number of prizes on their part, though this number was far from being able to balance the value of tho&s;e taken by the Americans; which during the year 1776, alone, amounted to more than a million &s;terling.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the direct lo&s;s by captures, the Briti&s;h trade &s;uffered otherwi&s;e by the prodigious ri&s;e of in&s;urance; that upon the We&s;t Indies now ri&s;ing to no le&s;s than 23 per cent. The increa&s;ing armaments of France and Spain al&s;o threatened an approaching war with the&s;e powers; &s;o that towards the end of October, 1776, the king i&s;&s;ued a proclamation for rai&s;ing the bounty to &s;eamen, who enli&s;ted, to 5<ABBR><HI>l,</HI></ABBR> per man. Six|teen additional &s;hips of the line were al&s;o &s;uddenly put into commi&s;&s;ion; and another proclamation was i&s;&s;ued, recalling all &s;eamen who were in any foreign &s;ervice. This was quickly followed by two others; the one laying an embargo on the exportation of provi&s;ions

<P>The idea of being attacked by the combined powers of France and Spain, whil&s;t engaged in a conte&s;t with the colonies, began at la&s;t to awaken the fears of the people. Su&s;picions of plots and trea&s;ons occurred; and the&s;e were increa&s;ed to a great degree by the at|tempts of an enthu&s;ia&s;tic mi&s;creant, known by the name of <HI>John the Painter,</HI> but who&s;e real name was <HI>James Aitken.</HI> This man was a native of Edinburgh, and bred a painter. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing an extraordinary &s;pirit of rambling, with a &s;trong propen&s;ity to vice, he had pa&s;&s;ed in the cour&s;e of a few years through a variety of tho&s;e &s;cenes and adventures which attend the mo&s;t profligate and abandoned &s;tate of a vagabond life.</P>
<P>Among his other exploits he had pa&s;&s;ed through &s;ev|eral marching regiments of foot, from each of which he de&s;erted as &s;oon as opportunity &s;erved, after receiv|ing the bounty money. In his various peregrinations through the different parts of England, he alternately committed highway robberies, burglaries, petty thefts, rapes, and worked at his trade, as occa&s;ion invited, villany prompted, or fear or nece&s;&s;ity operated. At la&s;t he pa&s;&s;ed over to America, where he remained for two or three years. His being of a melancholy &s;olitary nature, which neither &s;ought for a&s;&s;ociates in crimes, nor admitted of partners in plea&s;ure, as it contributed much to his pre&s;ervation for &s;o long a time from the ju&s;tice of tho&s;e laws which he was continually break|ing, &s;erved equally to throw in utter darkne&s;s all tho&s;e parts of his life, which he did not him&s;elf think fitting or nece&s;&s;ary to communicate. His tran&s;actions in A|merica are accordingly unknown, any farther, than that he traver&s;ed, and worked at his trade, in &s;everal of the colonies.</P>

As his pilgrimage on the continent, was in the be|ginning and during the progre&s;s of the troubles, it may well be imagined, that the violence of the language, and &s;entiments held in political matters, by that cla&s;s of the people with whom he lived and conver&s;ed, gave birth to that madne&s;s of enthu&s;ia&s;m in him, which after|wards filled him with the mo&s;t deadly antipathy to Britain. He accordingly returned to England, and &s;oon after, if not originally, adopted the de&s;ign of en|tirely &s;ubverting the power of the government and na|tion, by the &s;ole machinations of his own indu&s;try and ingenuity. This arduous ta&s;k was to be accompli&s;hed by &s;etting fire to the royal dock yards, and burning the principal trading cities and towns, with their &s;hipping. In the pro&s;ecution of this atrocious de&s;ign, he again traver&s;ed a great part of the kingdom, in order to ob|&s;erve the &s;tate of the &s;everal docks, and the manner in which they were guarded, which la&s;t he found as care|le&s;s as could be wi&s;hed. Having procured all the in|telligence he de&s;ired, his next care was to provide fire works, machines, and combu&s;tibles proper for the execution of his purpo&s;e; and had it not been for his ignorance in the proper mode of applying or con&s;truct|ing the&s;e machines, it is probable that the naval power of Britain might have been irretrievably ruined.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e machines, which extingui&s;hed of its own accord, was found in the hemp hou&s;e at Port&s;|mouth, which it had failed to &s;et on fire. He &s;uc|ceeded, however, in his de&s;ign of &s;etting the rope hou&s;e on fire; but the flames were &s;oon &s;ubdued, without communicating to the other magazines.</P>
<P>His next attempt was at Bri&s;tol, where, having failed two or three times in his endeavours to burn the &s;hipping,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Jan.</HI> 7. 1777.</NOTE> he at la&s;t determined to &s;ecure their de&s;truction by &s;etting fire to the hou&s;es next the qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y. In this he partly &s;ucceeded. Six or &s;even warehou&s;es were con&s;umed; but &s;till the
<PB N="138" REF="028963_0241_0FDDBF4527F7DB78">&s;hipping remained &s;afe. So many attempts, which where abortive, were always di&s;covered, and his machines being found, could not but excite the greate&s;t alarm. It could not be imagined that all this could proceed from the mere political enthu&s;ia&s;m of a wretched vag|abond. The two great parties into which Britain was divided, mutually accu&s;ed each other. The mo&s;t big|otted and furious on the one &s;ide attributed them to the di&s;affection and republican principles of the other; whil&s;t tho&s;e of the &s;ame denomination on the other &s;ide were equally convinced, that they were the mere inventions or malicious acts of the tories, for the pur|po&s;e of blackening their adver&s;aries.</P>
<P>Soon after the departure of this mi&s;creant from Bri&s;|tol, he was taken up on &s;ome &s;u&s;picious circum&s;tances, but behaved with an uncommon air and boldne&s;s, nor did he appear in any manner embarra&s;&s;ed in his defence. At la&s;t he was circumvented by another painter, called Baldwin, an American, who pretended to &s;ympathize with him under his misfortunes, and to hold principles &s;imilar to his own: thus the whole hi&s;tory of his crimes was brought to light.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS &s;ir William Howe now perceived that the army he commanded, however powerful in the field, was far from being &s;ufficient to effect the conque&s;t of &s;uch an exten&s;ive and difficult country, or even to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what he had gained, he re&s;olved to &s;trengthen it by every po&s;&s;ible method. For this pur|po&s;e,
<PB N="141" REF="028963_0242_0FDDBF465D8DEEE8">he collected as many of the refugees as could be per&s;uaded to enli&s;t into a body. Over the&s;e he ap|pointed officers, cho&s;en from among them&s;elves, who for their attachment to the royal cau&s;e, had been oblig|ed to abandon their properties, or who lived under his protection in New York I&s;land; governour Tryon being cho&s;en their commander.</P>
<P>A commi&s;&s;ion of brigadier general had been confer|red on Mr. Oliver Delancy, a loyali&s;t of great intere&s;t in New-York, and he was authori&s;ed to rai&s;e three battalions. Every effort was made to rai&s;e the men, both within and without the Briti&s;h lines, and al&s;o from among the American pri&s;oners; but with all the&s;e exertions, only 597 were procured. Mr. Court|land Skinner, a loyali&s;t well known in Jer&s;ey, was al&s;o appointed a brigadier, and authori&s;ed to rai&s;e five bat|talions; but all that he could rai&s;e by the middle of &s;ummer, amounted only to 517; by degrees, however, they were afterwards augmented con&s;iderably. The&s;e new levied forces were to be &s;tationed in New York and the adjacent i&s;lands, in order to give a freer &s;cope of operation to the grand army; and allow it to exert its whole &s;trength to effect that for which it was orig|inally de&s;tined; whil&s;t the va&s;t numbers of large riv|ers, which every where inter&s;ected the country, laid it open to the naval power, to which the Americans had nothing to oppo&s;e, and by which they were all along exceedingly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>With all the&s;e advantages, however, it was yet found impo&s;&s;ible to effect any great or permanent conque&s;t. The cau&s;es formerly mentioned &s;till continued to oper|ate, and to militate effectually again&s;t the royal army, and, indeed, to appearance, mu&s;t have been too powerful for any number of men which Britain could be &s;uppo&s;ed to bring into the field. The utmo&s;t that could now be done, therefore, was to carry on a kind of predatory war,
<PB N="142" REF="028963_0243_0FDDBF47F1B8A728">and this, however it might di&s;tre&s;s particular places, or amu&s;e the people in Britain with ideas of conque&s;t, could never contribute any thing effectual to the &s;ub|jugation of the country.</P>
<P>The provincials formed a plan, about the end of January, for taking Fort Independence, near King's Bridge, and by &s;o doing to obtain a pa&s;&s;age into New York I&s;land. About 4000 militia of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, Connecticut, and New York &s;tates, in four divi&s;ions, under generals Heath, Woo&s;ter, Par&s;ons, and Lincoln, were de&s;tined for the &s;ervice. General Heath, having the chief command, &s;ummoned the garri&s;on to &s;urren|der, with threats in ca&s;e of non-compliance. Nine days after the &s;iege had commenced, the enemy, being reinforced, made a &s;ally, but were repul&s;ed. Soon af|ter the be&s;iegers retired, upon a report that &s;ome &s;hips had gone up the North River. General Heath was much cen&s;ured for his conduct in this expedition by many of tho&s;e who accompanied him. His &s;ummons, as he did not fulfil his threats, &s;ubjected the army to the ridicule of their enemies. The Americans &s;uffered much from the weather, and not le&s;s from the failure of the expedition. Many of them afterwards cro&s;&s;ed the North River, and proceeded to Morri&s;town, where general Wa&s;hington wintered with his &s;mall army.</P>
<P>About the time this fruitle&s;s expedition commenced, plundering had become &s;o prevalent among the Ameri|can troops, that the commander in chief had it in&s;erted in general orders&mdash;"The general prohibits, both in the militia and continental troops, in the mo&s;t po&s;itive terms, the infamous practices of plundering the inhab|itants, under the &s;pecious pretence of their being tories. It is our bu&s;ine&s;s to give protection and &s;upport to the poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed inhabitants, not to multiply and increa&s;e their calamities. After this order, any officer found plundering the inhabitants under the pretence of their
<PB N="143" REF="028963_0243_0FDDBF47F1B8A728">being tories, may expect to be puni&s;hed in the &s;evere&s;t manner. The adjutant general to furni&s;h the com|manding officer of each divi&s;ion with a copy of the&s;e orders, who is to circulate copies among his troops immediately."</P>
<P>It was thought by many a matter of a&s;toni&s;hment, that the Briti&s;h &s;uffered the dangerous interval between the di&s;banding of one American army, and the rai&s;ing of another, to pa&s;s away without attempting &s;omething of con&s;equence, again&s;t the remaining &s;hadow of an armed force. Probably general Howe's information of the affairs of the provincials was as defective, at this time, as it had all along been to the royal commanders; or, perhaps, he did not chu&s;e to run any ri&s;k of derang|ing the mini&s;terial plan laid down for the campaign, e&s;pecially his intended junction with general Burgoyne, by making an attack on the American army, which, if not doubtful in its i&s;&s;ue, he had rea&s;on to believe, from pa&s;t experience, would at lea&s;t be attended with great lo&s;s on his &s;ide.</P>
<P>Had general Howe made a quick movement and at|tacked the provincials at that time, the event would probably have been fatal to America. The recruiting &s;ervice went on &s;o &s;lowly, and was attended with &s;o many untoward circum&s;tances, that general Wa&s;hing|ton, far from being formidable in the month of March, ob&s;erves, in a letter dated the 6th of that month, "If the enemy do not move, it will be a miracle: nothing but ignorance of our numbers, and &s;ituation, can pro|tect us." He afterwards owned, that during the latter part of the winter, he and his army remained at the mercy of the royal troops, with &s;ometimes &s;carcely a &s;ufficient body of men to mount the ordinary guards, liable every moment to be di&s;per&s;ed, if the enemy had thought proper to march again&s;t them. The general's whole force, including militia, at Morri&s;town, and the
<PB N="144" REF="028963_0244_0FDDBF494E9EDFC8">&s;everal outpo&s;ts, amounted often to not more than 1500 men: and it has been a&s;&s;erted, upon apparently good authority, that he repeatedly could not mu&s;ter more at Morri&s;town than between three and four hundred. In writing officially upon the &s;ubject to the governour and council of Connecticut, the repre&s;entation he gave of affairs, drew tears from the eyes of tho&s;e who heard the letter read. Whil&s;t general Wa&s;hington was at this low ebb with his army, gentlemen of five thou&s;and pounds fortune or more, and many others who were men of &s;ub&s;tance, though not equal to that, did duty as centinels at his doors and el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>Hitherto there had been a great deficiency of arms and ammunition, as well as of men. Fifteen hundred of the new troops from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts would have been upon their march to join the army, but the general court could not &s;upply them with arms. This per|plexity was, however, of &s;hort continuance. On the day of its commencement, or the following, a ve&s;&s;el of 14 guns, from France, arrived at Port&s;mouth, with 11,987 &s;tand of arms, and 1000 barrels of gunpowder. Congre&s;s, about the &s;ame time, were under a &s;imilar di&s;tre&s;s to &s;upply general Wa&s;h|ington's army,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>March</HI> 24.</NOTE> and met with timely relief by the arrival of a ve&s;&s;el with 10,000 &s;tand, be&s;ides a great number of gun locks.</P>
<P>Though general Howe made no capital &s;troke at the commander in chief of the Americans; yet he concerted an operation again&s;t the po&s;t at Peek's Kill, which gen|eral McDougal occupied, where a con&s;iderable quantity of provi&s;ions and &s;tores was depo&s;ited. A detachment of 500 men, under colonel Bird, was con|voyed by the Brune frigate to Peek's Kill,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>March</HI> 23.</NOTE> nearly fifty miles from New York. The provincials, finding them&s;elves unable to re&s;i&s;t, &s;et &s;ire to the &s;tores, and the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers completed the
<PB N="145" REF="028963_0244_0FDDBF494E9EDFC8">conflagration, and de&s;troyed &s;ome &s;mall craft laden with provi&s;ions. Colonel Bird, hearing that a rein|forcement was expected by the Americans, re-embark|ed the &s;ame day.</P>
<P>The &s;tores de&s;troyed at Peek's Kill, being found greatly inferior in magnitude and importance to what the general had been led to expect, another expedition was undertaken again&s;t Danbury, on the borders of Connecticut, and contiguous to Courtland Manor, where it was &s;aid immen&s;e &s;tores had been collected. Major general Tryon, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by general Agnew and &s;ir William Er&s;kine, with a detachment of 2000 men, embarked, pa&s;&s;ed the &s;ound, and having landed between Fairfield and Norwalk,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>April</HI> 26.</NOTE> reached Danbury in twenty hours: per|ceiving that the country was ri&s;ing to intercept his return, and being de&s;titute of carriages to remove the &s;tores, general Tryon immediately gave orders to burn and de&s;troy the whole. The troops accompli&s;hed the&s;e orders without injuring the property of &s;uch as were reputed tories. 18 hou&s;es, 800 barrels of pork and beef, 800 barrels of flour, 2000 bu&s;hels of grain, 1700 tents, and &s;ome other articles were lo&s;t to the Americans.</P>
<P>The royali&s;ts, on their return, were hara&s;&s;ed by mil|itia under generals Woo&s;ter, Arnold, and Silliman, who retarded their march, until a greater force could be a&s;&s;embled to effect the de&s;ign of cutting off their retreat. Woo&s;ter hung upon the rear of the detach|ment, whil&s;t Arnold, by cro&s;&s;ing the country, gained their front, in order to di&s;pute their pa&s;&s;age through Ridgefield, nor could the excellent order and formida|ble appearance of the Briti&s;h forces, which had large covering parties, well furni&s;hed with field pieces, on their flanks and rear, nor the tumultuary manner in which the American militia, not very numerous, had a&s;&s;embled, prevent them from taking advantage of
<PB N="146" REF="028963_0245_0FDDBF4AEA1B4430">every &s;ituation to interrupt the progre&s;s of the royal army.</P>
<P>In one of the&s;e &s;kirmi&s;hes, general Woo&s;ter, an ex|perienced officer, was mortally wounded, whil&s;t fight|ing with all the vigour and fire of youth, though then &s;eventy years old. He died a few days after, much honoured and regretted by his country.</P>
<P>General Arnold, with about 500 men, next oppo&s;ed them in the town of Ridgefield, where, having barri|cadoed the road, he kept up a bri&s;k fire upon them, and &s;u&s;tained their attack till they made a lodgement on a ledge of rocks on his left. After the Briti&s;h had gained this eminence, a whole platoon levelled at gen|eral Arnold, when not more than 30 yards di&s;tant. His hor&s;e was killed, but he e&s;caped. Whil&s;t he was extricating him&s;elf from his hor&s;e, which he did with great agility, a &s;oldier ran up to &s;tab him with his bay|onet; upon which Arnold &s;uddenly drew a pi&s;tol, and &s;hot his enemy dead as he approached.</P>
<P>Next day, the Americans, having received &s;ome reinforcements with cannon, hara&s;&s;ed the rear of the Briti&s;h in &s;everal detached parties, and profited by every difficulty of ground, keeping up a &s;cattering fire upon them until they got within protection of their &s;hipping.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h accounts &s;tate their own lo&s;s to have been only 172 killed and wounded; of which the latter were more than two thirds: and that of the Americans to have been double the number. No officer of di&s;|tinction was lo&s;t on the Briti&s;h &s;ide. Three field of|ficers were wounded; one of whom was brigadier general Agnew. The Americans computed 2 or 300 men of the Briti&s;h to have been killed or wounded; and only 20 killed and 40 wounded on their &s;ide. Among the former, be&s;ides general Woo&s;ter, was Dr. Atwater, a gentleman of great re&s;pectability and in|fluence, and colonel Lamb was among the latter.
<PB N="147" REF="028963_0245_0FDDBF4AEA1B4430">Although the Briti&s;h accompli&s;hed the object of their expedition, yet the mi&s;chief done to the Americans was not at all equivalent to the trouble and lo&s;s they &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s, in acknowledgment of the merit and &s;er|vices of general Woo&s;ter, re&s;olved that a monument &s;hould be erected to his memory. They al&s;o re&s;olved, that a hor&s;e, properly capari&s;oned, &s;hould be pre&s;ented to general Arnold, in their name, as a token of their approbation of his gallant conduct.</P>
<P>In return for this incur&s;ion, the provincials under|took a &s;imilar one again&s;t Long I&s;land, where they were informed that a quantity of forage, grain, and other nece&s;&s;aries lay at the little port called Sagg Harbour, protected only by a company of foot and an armed &s;chooner.</P>
<P>This expedition was conducted by colonel Meigs, a brave and enterpri&s;ing officer, who had attended Ar|nold in his expedition to Quebeck, and had been taken pri&s;oner in the attempt to &s;torm that place. On the 23d of May, he pa&s;&s;ed his detachment of 170 men, in whale boats, over the found which &s;eparates Con|necticut from Long I&s;land, and landed on the north &s;ide of the i&s;land, under the convoy of two armed &s;loops, and another unarmed to bring off pri&s;oners; but having a narrow bay to cro&s;s before they could reach the place of their de&s;tination, they were now obliged to carry their boats acro&s;s a neck of land before they could reach it. Having &s;urmounted this difficulty, colonel Meigs, with about 150 men, landed on the &s;outh branch of the i&s;land, within about four miles of Sagg Harbour, leaving their boats &s;ecured in the wood under a guard. They arrived at the place before day,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>April.</HI> 24.</NOTE> and &s;peedily accompli&s;hed their purpo&s;e, notwith&s;tanding the re&s;i&s;tance of the &s;oldiers, and the crews of the ve&s;&s;els, together with
<PB N="148" REF="028963_0246_0FDDBF4C60420E80">the vigorous efforts of the &s;chooner, which kept up a continual fire of round and grape &s;hot at not more than 150 yards di&s;tance. Twelve brigs and &s;loops which lay at the wharf were burnt, and every thing on &s;hore entirely de&s;troyed. Six of the &s;oldiers were &s;lain; and ninety pri&s;oners were brought off, con&s;i&s;ting of the officer who commanded the men, with mo&s;t of the ma&s;ters and crews of the ve&s;&s;els which they had de&s;troyed; and the party returned to Guildford, in Connecticut, in no longer &s;pace than 25 hours after they had departed from it, having in that &s;hort time traver&s;ed 90 miles by land and water, be&s;ides de&s;troying the ve&s;&s;els, without having a &s;ingle man either killed or wounded. Colonel Meigs had an elegant &s;word pre|&s;ented him by congre&s;s for his good conduct in this expedition.</P>
<P>The &s;ea&s;on for action was now far advanced, and towards the latter end of May general Wa&s;hington be|ing &s;omewhat reinforced, quitted Morri&s;town, and took a &s;trong po&s;ition at Middlebrook; his army, how|ever, did not exceed 7292 at the opening of the campaign.
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>June</HI> 9.</NOTE> Soon after this movement was effected, the Briti&s;h marched from Brun&s;|wick, and extended their van as far as Somer&s;et court|hou&s;e, but in a few days returned to their former &s;tation.</P>
<P>The great object of the campaign, on the &s;ide of New York, &s;eems to have been, that &s;ir William Howe &s;hould penetrate through the Jer&s;ies to the Delaware, to clear tho&s;e provinces of the provincial troops, and reduce the inhabitants to &s;uch a &s;tate of &s;ubjection, that a &s;afe and open communication between the army and the city of New York might be e&s;tabli&s;hed. The &s;ingle movement which the American general had now made, however, effectually prevented the accompli&s;h|ment of this de&s;ign, or indeed of any thing el&s;e of
<PB N="149" REF="028963_0246_0FDDBF4C60420E80">con&s;equence. His camp, winding along the cour&s;e of the hills, was &s;trongly intrenched, fortified, and well covered with artillery. He commanded a view of the Briti&s;h encampment on the hills of Brun&s;wick, and a great part of the intermediate country towards that place and Amboy. His army al&s;o increa&s;ed daily in numbers. Several bodies of the New England troops under generals Gates, Par&s;ons, and Arnold, advanced to the borders of the North River, where they were ready to pa&s;s over to the Jer&s;ies, whenever there was occa&s;ion; whil&s;t the Jer&s;ey militia collected with the greate&s;t alacrity from all quarters; &s;o that whatever po&s;ition the royal army could take, it was &s;till watched on all &s;ides by its enemies. A mi&s;take, fortunate for the Americans, made the militia a&s;&s;emble in great force on this emergency. Signals had been agreed upon, and beacons erected on high places, to give in&s;tantane|ous notice of the approach of the Briti&s;h. A few hours before the royal army began to march, the &s;ignal of alarm, on the foundation of a fal&s;e report, had been made. The farmers, re&s;olved to try the effects of re|&s;i&s;tance, in preference to a &s;econd &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, with arms in their hands, ran to the place of rendezvous from con&s;iderable di&s;tances. They had &s;et out at lea&s;t twelve hours before the Briti&s;h, and on their appearance were collected in formidable numbers. General Howe left no means untried to induce his rival to quit the &s;trong po&s;ition he had taken. He pu&s;hed on detachments, and made feints as if he intended to pa&s;s him, and cro&s;s the Delaware. This manoeuvre proving ineffec|tual, he advanced in front of general Wa&s;hington's lines, where he continued for four days exploring the approaches to his camp, and accurately examining the &s;ituation of his po&s;ts; hoping to find &s;ome unguarded place, upon which an attack might be made with &s;ome probability of &s;ucce&s;s; or that chance, inadvertence,
<PB N="150" REF="028963_0247_0FDDBF532DADB1F0">impatience, or error, might occa&s;ion &s;ome movement or circum&s;tance, which might lead to a general engage|ment. All the&s;e hopes, however, were fru&s;trated. General Wa&s;hington knew the value of his &s;ituation; and as he could neither be provoked, nor &s;urpri&s;ed in &s;uch a manner as to oblig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> him to quit the advantages he derived from it, &s;o he had too much penetration and fore&s;ight to lo&s;e them by circumvention or artifice; and he had too long profited by this cautious conduct, of never committing the fortune of America to the haz|ard of a &s;ingle battle, to depart from it on this occa|&s;ion, when it was not even demanded by any urgent nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>General Howe now found it nece&s;&s;ary to change his mea&s;ures. On the 19th of June, he &s;udden|ly retreated with &s;ome apparent marks of precipitation;
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>June</HI> 19.</NOTE> and withdrawing his troops from Brun&s;wick, took the road with his whole army towards Amboy. The apparently retreating Briti&s;h, were pur&s;ued by large detachments of the Americans, commanded by generals Maxwell, lord Sterling and Conway, who gained &s;ome trifling advantages; whil&s;t &s;ome exce&s;&s;es, committed by the &s;oldiers during their retreat, inflamed the provincials &s;till more with a de&s;ire of retaliation and revenge. In this, and the former retreat to Brun&s;wick, farm hou&s;es were burnt and de|&s;troyed, nor did they &s;pare tho&s;e buildings which were dedicated to the Deity. At la&s;t, general Wa&s;hington him&s;elf, with the whole army, left his &s;trong camp on the hills, and advanced to Quibbletown, to be near at hand for the &s;upport of his advanced parties. This was no &s;ooner perceived by the Briti&s;h com|mander,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>June</HI> 24.</NOTE> than he marched back from Amboy with the utmo&s;t expedition, hoping to cut off &s;ome of the American detachments, or bring on a general engagement near Quibbletown; or if neither
<PB N="151" REF="028963_0247_0FDDBF532DADB1F0">of the&s;e could be accompli&s;hed, it was intended, that lord Cornwallis, with his divi&s;ion, &s;hould take a con|&s;iderable circuit, and thus gain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome &s;trong pa&s;&s;es, which would oblige the American general to quit the advantageous ground he had taken. In all this, however, he was fru&s;trated, through the &s;kill and vigilance of his rival. General Wa&s;hington no &s;ooner perceived the real intent of the enemy, than he with|drew his army from the plains, and with the utmo&s;t expedition regained his &s;trong camp, &s;ecuring the pa&s;&s;|es, at the &s;ame time, &s;o effectually, that nothing could be attempted again&s;t them. Lord Cornwallis, indeed, fell in with lord Sterling, who had po&s;ted him&s;elf in a &s;trong &s;ituation with about 3000 troops, who &s;eemed inclined to di&s;pute his pa&s;&s;age. The&s;e were broken, however, in a very &s;hort time, with the lo&s;s of a few men and three bra&s;s field pieces; but the neighbour|hood of the woods prevented the pur&s;uit from being continued with any effect.</P>
<P>General Howe being now convinced that it would be im|po&s;&s;ible to induce general Wa&s;hington to quit his &s;trong po&s;ition, and hazard a general engagement; and &s;u&s;|pecting that it would be too hazardous to attempt pa&s;&s;|ing the Delaware, whil&s;t the country was in arms, and the American army in full force in his rear, determin|ed to make an attempt on Philadelphia by &s;ea; which mu&s;t be attended by the&s;e manife&s;t advantages, that it would be impo&s;&s;ible for general Wa&s;hington to know where the &s;torm was to fall. He mu&s;t, therefore, keep his po&s;t, and the king's army would make a con&s;idera|ble progre&s;s, before he could be in a condition to op|po&s;e them; and &s;uch a progre&s;s would not leave him that choice of po&s;ts from which he had hitherto deriv|ed &s;uch advantage. In order more effectually to de|ceive and perplex general Wa&s;hington, the Briti&s;h general ordered &s;ome tran&s;ports, with a &s;hip cut down
<PB N="152" REF="028963_0248_0FDDBF54A62F15E0">to act as a floating battery, up the North River, a little before the embarkation was completed; a feint which &s;ucceeded &s;o far as to induce the American general to detach a con&s;iderable body of his army acro&s;s that river.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the preparations nece&s;&s;ary for this expedition were going forward, the Americans found means to make amends for the capture of general Lee by that of general Pre&s;cot, who was &s;eized in his quarters in Rhode I&s;land, together with his aid de camp, in much the &s;ame manner as general Lee had been. This was exceedingly mortifying to the general him&s;elf, as he had not long before &s;et a price upon general Arnold, by offering a &s;um of money to any one that apprehended him; which the latter an&s;wered by &s;etting a lower price upon general Pre&s;cot: the latter was, however, exchanged in the following year for general Lee.</P>
<P>The month of July was far advanced before the preparations for the expedition again&s;t Phila|delphia were completed;
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>July</HI> 23.</NOTE> and it was the 23d before the fleet was able to &s;ail from Sandy-Hook. The force employed in this expedition con|&s;i&s;ted of 36 battalions of Briti&s;h and He&s;&s;ians, a regi|ment of light hor&s;e, and a body of loyali&s;ts rai&s;ed at New York. The remainder of the&s;e, with 17 battal|ions, and another body of light hor&s;e, were &s;tationed at New York under &s;ir Henry Clinton. Seven battal|ions were &s;tationed at Rhode I&s;land. After a week's &s;ailing, tho&s;e forces, amounting in all to about 16,000 men, arrived at the mouth of the Delaware; but there having received intelligence, that the navigation of the river was &s;o effectually ob&s;tructed, that no po&s;&s;ibility of forcing a pa&s;&s;age remained; or more probably that general Wa&s;hington had marched within a &s;hort di&s;|tance of Philadelphia; it was re&s;olved to proceed far|ther &s;outhward to Che&s;apeak Bay in Maryland, from
<PB N="153" REF="028963_0248_0FDDBF54A62F15E0">whence the di&s;tance to Philadelphia was not very great, and where the provincial army would find le&s;s advan|tage from the nature of the country than in the Jer&s;ies.</P>
<P>The navigation from Delaware to Che&s;apeak took up the be&s;t part of the month of Augu&s;t, and that up the bay it&s;elf was extremely difficult and tedious. At la&s;t, having &s;ailed up the river Elk, as far as was practicable,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Aug.</HI> 25.</NOTE> the troops were landed with|out oppo&s;ition at Turkey Point, and &s;et for|ward on their intended expedition.</P>
<P>General Wa&s;hington having heard that the Briti&s;h fleet had put out to &s;ea after having looked into the Delaware, was confirmed in the opinion he had for|merly entertained, that the whole was a feint, calculated to draw the American army farther from the North River, &s;o as to prevent their being at hand to oppo&s;e a junction between Howe and Burgoyne. With this view, the American general took a middle &s;tation; from which he could &s;peedily return to the North Riv|er, or advance to the relief of Philadelphia.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t both general Wa&s;hington and congre&s;s were &s;ufficiently engaged, by their attention to the move|ments, and apprehen&s;ion of the de&s;igns, of the power|ful fleet and army which was conducted by the brother generals and commi&s;&s;ioners, they were alarmed with the news of general Burgoyne's &s;ucce&s;s on the Lakes and the abandonment of Ticonderoga by general St. Clair; which will be hereafter related in the account of the northern campaign. The&s;e were events, &s;o un|expected, that they could not fail to perplex their coun&s;els, and impede their defen&s;ive preparations in other parts. Congre&s;s, however, behaved with great firmne&s;s in this exigency. They directed general Wa&s;hington to appoint other commanders, and to &s;um|mon &s;uch numbers of the militia from the ea&s;tern and
<PB N="154" REF="028963_0249_0FDDBF563864D808">central provinces, as he &s;hould deem &s;ufficient for re|&s;training the progre&s;s of the enemy.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h fleet, after leaving the capes of Dela|ware, were not heard of for near three weeks, except that they had been &s;een once or twice &s;teering &s;outh|wardly. It was therefore concluded that the object of the Briti&s;h was Charle&s;ton, in South Carolina, and, as the army could not march in time for its relief, it was re&s;olved to attempt &s;omething on New York I&s;l|and, or, by uniting with the northern army, to give more effectual oppo&s;ition to Burgoyne; who&s;e affairs at this time were in a mo&s;t pro&s;perous train, as will be hereafter de&s;cribed. Conformably to this &s;y&s;tem, a &s;mall change of po&s;ition took place. The day before this re&s;olution was adopted, the Briti&s;h fleet had en|tered the Che&s;apeak; and intelligence thereof reached the American army in a few <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oop; were now put in motion to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">. Every appearance of confidence was a&s;&s;umed by them as they pa&s;&s;ed through Philadelphia, that the citizens might be intimidated from joining the Briti&s;h; and a number of the principal inhabitants, &s;u&s;pected of di&s;affection to the American cau&s;e, were taken into cu&s;tody, and &s;ent to Virginia.</P>
<P>Sir William Howe, &s;oon after he had landed his troops in Maryland, put forth a declaration, in which he informed the inhabitants, that he had i&s;&s;ued the &s;tricte&s;t orders to the troops "for the pre&s;ervation of regularity and good di&s;cipline, and that the mo&s;t exem|plary puni&s;hment &s;hould be inflicted upon tho&s;e who &s;hould dare to plunder the property, or mole&s;t the per|&s;ons of any of his maje&s;ty's well di&s;po&s;ed &s;ubjects."
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sept.</HI> 3.</NOTE> The royal army &s;et out from the ea&s;tern heads of the Che&s;apeak on the 3d of September, leaving their tents and baggage behind, and tru&s;ted their future accommodation to &s;uch quarters as
<PB N="155" REF="028963_0249_0FDDBF563864D808">their arms might procure. They advanced till they were within two miles of the American army, which was then po&s;ted near Newport. General Wa&s;hington &s;oon changed the po&s;ition, and took po&s;t on the high ground near Chadd's Fort, on Brandywine Creek, with an intention of di&s;puting the pa&s;&s;age. His army con|&s;i&s;ted of 14,000 men, but the real effective force that could be brought into action did not exceed 8000; that of the Briti&s;h amounted to 16,000, when they left New York, but although the whole of the&s;e were not brought into action, the Briti&s;h were &s;till &s;uperior in number to the provincials. General Wa&s;hington was in a manner obliged to ri&s;k an action for the de|fence of Philadelphia. The opinion of the inhabitants, though founded on no circum&s;tances more &s;ub&s;tantial than their wi&s;hes, impo&s;ed this &s;pecies of nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>A general action was therefore hazarded. On the 11th of September,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sept.</HI> 11.</NOTE> at day break, the Briti&s;h army advanced in two columns. The right under general Knyphau&s;en, marched direct|ly to Chadd's Ford, which lay in the centre of the A|merican lines, where they expected the principal attack, their right and left covering &s;ome le&s;s practicable fords for &s;everal miles on either hand. A heavy cannonade commenced about 10 o'clock on both &s;ides, and repeat|ed di&s;po&s;itions for pa&s;&s;ing the ford were made by the Briti&s;h general in order to deceive the Americans. This feint had the de&s;ired effect. The American gen|eral, &s;uppo&s;ing the whole force of the royal army to be in his front, detached large parties acro&s;s the river to impede or fru&s;trate this de&s;ign, and kept up a con|tinual &s;eries of &s;kirmi&s;hes with the Briti&s;h troops, &s;ometimes advancing, and at others obliged to retreat, until at la&s;t they were obliged to retreat with con&s;ider|able lo&s;s. In the mean time lord Cornwallis, at the head of the &s;econd column, took a large circuit to the
<PB N="156" REF="028963_0250_0FDDBF57A8E5D170">left, until he gained the forks of the Brandywine, where, from the divi&s;ion of the river, it could be more ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> forded. Having accordingly pa&s;&s;ed both branches about two in the afternoon, he took the &s;horte&s;t road down the river, in order to fall upon the right flank of the provincials.</P>
<P>General Wa&s;hington having been appri&s;ed of this movement, about two hours before, endeavoured as well as he could to provide again&s;t its effect, by detack|ing general Sullivan, with as many troops as he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;pare, to oppo&s;e Cornwallis. This ta&s;k was exe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> with great military &s;kill. General Sullivan po&s;ted his troops in the &s;trong grounds above Birmingham church, his flanks being covered with very thick woods, and his front with artillery very advantageou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed. The ardour of the Briti&s;h and He&s;&s;ian troops, however, overthrew every ob&s;tacle. The action began about 4 o'clock, and the Americans, after a &s;pirited oppo&s;i|tion, were driven from their po&s;ts, and pur&s;ued into the woods in their rear. Con&s;iderable re&s;i&s;tance was made by a part of the right wing, which had not been broken. The&s;e took another &s;trong po&s;ition in a wood, and were not di&s;lodged for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>As the main and collected body of the Briti&s;h army continued to advance; they fell in with a &s;trong party of the provincials which had not been engaged. The&s;e had po&s;ted them&s;elves advantageou&s;ly, in order to cover that wing of the army which had been defeated, and maintained their ground &s;o vigorou&s;ly, that they could not be driven from it before the night was con&s;ider|able advanced, when the darkne&s;s prevented the con|querors from reaping any benefit of their victory.</P>
<P>General Knyphau&s;en, at la&s;t, after having amu&s;ed the provincials all day, made good his pa&s;&s;age in the evening, when he found that they were already deeply engaged on the right. He carried the intrenchment,
<PB N="157" REF="028963_0250_0FDDBF57A8E5D170">and took the battery and cannon, which defended Chadd's Ford; and at the &s;ame in&s;tant, &s;ome Briti&s;h troops who had been engaged in the woods, and at la&s;t made &s;hift to penetrate through them, happening to make their appearance, the Americans were thrown into &s;uch con&s;ternation, that an immediate retreat or flight took place. General Weedon's brigade, and tho&s;e under general Green covered the retreat of the flying troops: and nothing but the darkne&s;s of the night prevented a total and ruinous defeat to the Americans.</P>
<P>Though on this occa&s;ion the victory undoubtedly belonged to the Briti&s;h, it was far from being of that final and deci&s;ive kind, which people had been led to expect in the event of a meeting between the Briti&s;h and American armies, on nearly equal terms, both as to numbers and the nature of the ground. Such had been the ca&s;e at pre&s;ent; and though the Americans were inferior in force, yet the whole day was nearly con&s;umed before victory was obtained. The Ameri|cans lo&s;t in this action, including officers, 300 killed, 600 wounded, and 400 taken pri&s;oners. Among the latter was the baron de St. Ouary, who &s;erved as a vol|unteer. They al&s;o lo&s;t ten &s;mall field pieces and one howitzer, of which all, but one, were bra&s;s.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s in the royal army was not in proportion, being &s;omewhat under 500, of which the &s;lain did not amount to one fifth. The officers &s;uffered con&s;idera|bly, e&s;pecially in wounded, though no one of higher rank than a captain was killed.</P>
<P>Here the celebrated marquis de la Fayette fir&s;t bled in the cau&s;e of liberty, which he had e&s;pou&s;ed with enthu&s;ia&s;tic ardour. His wound was &s;light, but it en|deared him to the Americans. General Woodford was likewi&s;e wounded. Mon&s;ieur du Coudray, a
<PB N="158" REF="028963_0251_0FDDBF596EF4F348">French officer of high rank, and great abilities, was drowned about this time in the river Schuylkill, whil&s;t on his way to join the American army.</P>
<P>The evening after the battle of Brandywine, a party of the Briti&s;h was &s;ent to Wilmington, who took Mr. McKinley, the governour of the Delaware &s;tate, pri&s;on|er. They al&s;o took a &s;hallop lying in the creek, loaded with the rich effects of &s;ome of the inhabitants, to|gether with the public records of the county, and a large quantity of public and private money, be&s;ides articles of plate and other things.</P>
<P>The Americans retreated fir&s;t to Che&s;ter, and then to Philadelphia, where general Wa&s;hington u&s;ed the utmo&s;t diligence to repair his lo&s;s. Within a few days he came out with a de&s;ign to ri&s;k another action, and advanced as far as the Warren tavern, on the Lanca&s;ter road. Near that place both armies were on the point of engaging with their whole force,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sept.</HI> 18.</NOTE> but were prevented by a &s;torm of rain which la&s;ted for a whole day and night. When the rain cea&s;ed, the Americans found that their ammuni|tion was entirely ruined; &s;o they retired to a place of &s;afety.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h left their po&s;ition near the White Hor&s;e tavern, and began to march towards Reading, where the provincials had a quantity of &s;tores, upon which, general Wa&s;hington took a new po&s;ition, and left the Briti&s;h in undi&s;turbed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the roads leading to Philadelphia.</P>
<P>General Howe having intelligence that general Wayne was lying in the woods with a corps of 1500 men and four pieces of cannon,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sept.</HI> 20.</NOTE> in the rear of the left wing of his army, de|tached general Grey, on the 20th of September, late at night, with two regiments and a body of light in|fantry, to &s;urpri&s;e him. Grey gained Wayne's left
<PB N="159" REF="028963_0251_0FDDBF596EF4F348">about one o'clock in the morning. Some out &s;entries were very early mi&s;&s;ed by an American officer going his rounds, and an alarm being given, the general pa|raded them in the light of their fires, in&s;tead of with|drawing them to the back of their encampment. Thus the Briti&s;h were directed where to ru&s;h on with their bayonets, as ordered by their commander. About three hundred were killed and wounded on the &s;pot. They took between 70 and 80 pri&s;oners, including &s;everal officers, a great many arms, and eight waggons loaded with baggage and &s;tores. The enterpri&s;e was conducted with &s;uch addre&s;s that the lo&s;s of the a&s;&s;ail|ants did not exceed eight.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s, which after a &s;hort re&s;idence at Baltimore had returned to Philadelphia, were obliged a &s;econd time to con&s;ult their &s;afely by flight. They retired fir&s;t to Lanca&s;ter and then to Yorktown. Nothing now prevented &s;ir William Howe from taking po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of Philadelphia. He therefore left the bulk of his forces in Germantown, and, with a &s;mall part, made his triumphant entry into the city, and was re|ceived with a hearty welcome of numerous citizens,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sept.</HI> 26.</NOTE> who, either from principle, intere&s;t, or cowardice, had hitherto &s;eparated them|&s;elves from the cla&s;s of active whigs.</P>
<P>Lord Howe was no &s;ooner acquainted with the &s;uc|ce&s;s of his brother, than he took the mo&s;t &s;peedy and effectual mea&s;ures for conducting the fleet and tran|&s;ports round to the Delaware. The voyage was intri|cate, tedious, and dangerous; and nothing le&s;s than his &s;uperior &s;kill and ability, which was exerted in the conduct and management of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> great a number of &s;hips, could have prevented the lo&s;s from being con|&s;iderable; but, as the pa&s;&s;age to Philadelphia was yet impracticable, the fleet drew up and anchored along
<PB N="160" REF="028963_0252_0FDDBF5AE5200358">the &s;hore of Penn&s;ylvania from Reedy I&s;land to New|ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t object of the Briti&s;h troops, after taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the city, was to cut off, by means of &s;trong batteries, the communication between the upper and lower parts of the river; which was executed, not|with&s;tanding the oppo&s;ition of &s;ome American armed ve&s;&s;els; one of which, the Delaware frigate, carrying 36 guns, was taken. The next ta&s;k was to open a com|munication with it by &s;ea; and this was a work of no &s;mall difficulty. A va&s;t number of batteries and forts had been erected, and immen&s;e machines formed like <HI>chevaux de frixe,</HI> from whence they took their name, funk in the river to prevent its navigation. As the fleet now cooperated with the army, this work, however difficult, was accompli&s;hed; nor did the pro|vincials give much oppo&s;ition, as well knowing that all places of this kind were now untenable. General Wa&s;hington, however, took the advantage of the royal army being divided to attack the camp of the principal divi&s;ion of it that lay at Germantown,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Oct.</HI> 4.</NOTE> in the neighbourhood of Philadelphia. In this he met with very little &s;ucce&s;s; for though he reached the place of de&s;tination by three o'clock in the morning, the patroles had time to call the troops to arms. The morning was likewi&s;e extremely foggy. This, by concealing the true &s;ituation of the parties, who made the attack at different places, occa&s;ioned mi&s;takes, and made &s;o much caution nece&s;&s;ary as to give the Briti&s;h time to recover from the effects of their fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;e, which the bold attack of the Americans had occa&s;ioned. The latter, notwith&s;tanding, made a very re&s;olute a&s;&s;ault: but they were received with &s;o much bravery, that they were compelled to abandon the attempt, and retreat in great di&s;order; with the advantage, however, of carrying off their cannon,
<PB N="161" REF="028963_0252_0FDDBF5AE5200358">though pur&s;ued for a con&s;iderable way, after having upwards of 200 killed, and about 500 wounded, and upwards of 400 taken pri&s;oners, among whom were 54 officers. On the Briti&s;h &s;ide, the lo&s;s amounted to 430 wounded and pri&s;oners, and 70 killed; but among the la&s;t were general Agnew and colonel Bird, with &s;ome other excellent officers.</P>
<P>There &s;till remained two &s;trong forts on the Dela|ware to be reduced. The&s;e were Mud I&s;land and Red Bank. The various ob&s;tructions which the Ameri|cans had thrown in the way rendered it nece&s;&s;ary to bring up the Augu&s;ta, a &s;hip of the line, and the Merlin frigate, to the attack of Mud I&s;land; but dur|ing the heat of action both were grounded. Upon this, the Americans &s;ent down four fire &s;hips, and di|rected the whole fire from their galleys again&s;t them. The former were rendered ineffectual by the courage and &s;kill of the Briti&s;h &s;eamen; but during the en|gagement both the Augu&s;ta and Merlin took fire and were burnt to a&s;hes, and the other &s;hips obliged to withdraw. The Americans, encouraged by this un&s;uc|ce&s;sful attempt proceeded to throw new ob&s;tructions in the way: but the Briti&s;h general having found means to convey a number of cannon and to erect batteries within a gun&s;hot of the fort by land, and bringing up three &s;hips of the line which mounted heavy cannon, the garri&s;on, after making a vigorous defence for one day, perceiving that preparations were making for a general a&s;&s;ault on the next, abandoned the place in the night. Tho&s;e who defended Red Bank followed their example, and abandoned it on the approach of lord Cornwallis. In the attacks on the&s;e forts the Briti&s;h lo&s;t a con&s;iderable number of men. In that on Red Bank alone, there were not le&s;s than 400 men killed and wounded; and their leader, count Donop, was mortally wounded and taken pri&s;oner. A great num|ber
<PB N="162" REF="028963_0253_0FDDBF5C21572030">of the American &s;hipping, now finding them&s;elves entirely de&s;titute of any protection, &s;ailed up the river in the night time. Seventeen, however, remained, who&s;e retreat was intercepted by a frigate and &s;ome armed ve&s;&s;els; on which the Americans ran them a&s;hore and burnt them, to prevent their falling into the ene|my's hands.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t &s;ir William Howe was &s;ucceeding in every enterpri&s;e in Penn&s;ylvania, intelligence arrived that general Burgoyne and his whole army had &s;urrendered pri&s;oners of war to the Americans at Saratoga, as will be related in the account of the northern campaign. General Wa&s;hington &s;oon after received a con&s;iderable reinforcement from the northern army, which had ac|compli&s;hed this great event. With this increa&s;ed force he took a po&s;ition at and near White Mar&s;h. At the &s;ame time the Briti&s;h general had received a &s;imilar re|inforcement from New York; and conceiving that general Wa&s;hington, from the di&s;po&s;ition of his army, might perhaps incline to venture an engagement, marched from Philadelphia on the 4th of December at night;
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dec.</HI> 4.</NOTE> and next morning took po&s;t on Che&s;nut Hill, in the front of the right wing of the American army; but general Wa&s;hington, though he ardently wi&s;hed to be attacked, would not relinqui&s;h a po&s;ition from which he hoped for repara|tion for the adver&s;ities of the campaign. General Howe remained three days in the neighbourhood,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dec.</HI> 7.</NOTE> and explored the right and left wings of their camp, &s;uppo&s;ing that &s;ome part of it might be found liable to an attack. Every part was found equally inacce&s;&s;ible; and though frequent &s;kirmi&s;hes en&s;ued, and the royal army advanced within a mile of the American lines, nothing could entice or provoke general Wa&s;hington to leave his po&s;ition. General Howe, therefore, gave up the thoughts of any farther
<PB N="163" REF="028963_0253_0FDDBF5C21572030">attempt for the &s;ea&s;on, as his officers and &s;oldiers &s;uf|fered the mo&s;t grievous &s;everities of the weather from the want of tents, and other field equipage; he, accord|ingly, on the 8th of December, began his march for Philadelphia, in full view of the Americans, without being in the lea&s;t incommoded on his return.</P>
<P>Three days after,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dec.</HI> 11.</NOTE> the American army marched from White Mar&s;h to Swedes' Ford, and afterwards to Valley Forge,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dec.</HI> 19.</NOTE> on the Shuykill, about 15 miles from Philadelphia, where they remained in huts during the winter. In this march the army might have been tracked by the blood of their feet, upon the hard frozen road, occa&s;ioned by the want of &s;hoes and &s;tockings. This extreme want of clothing put the general under the nece&s;&s;ity of granting warrants to impre&s;s what the holders would not willingly part with, agreeably to the power with which congre&s;s had inve&s;ted him.</P>
<P>About this time the Briti&s;h fleet at Philadelphia re|ceived an alarm of &s;o uncommon a nature, that &s;ome account of it becomes nece&s;&s;ary. Early in the war, Mr. David Bu&s;hnel of Saybrook, in Connecticut, in|vented a machine for &s;ubmarine navigation, different from any thing hitherto devi&s;ed by the art of man. This machine was &s;o con&s;tructed as that it could be rowed horizontally, at any given depth, under water, and could be rai&s;ed or depre&s;&s;ed at plea&s;ure. To this machine, called the <HI>American Turtle,</HI> was attached a magazine of gun powder, which was intended to be fa&s;tened under the bottom of a &s;hip, with a driving &s;crew, in &s;uch a way as that the &s;ame &s;troke which di&s;|engaged it from the machine &s;hould put the internal clock work in motion. This being done, the ordinary operation of a gun lock, at the di&s;tance of half an hour, or any determinate time, would cau&s;e the powder to explode and leave the effects to the common laws of
<PB N="164" REF="028963_0254_0FDDBF5DA08C2740">nature. The &s;implicity, yet combination di&s;covered in the mechani&s;m of this wonderful machine, have been acknowledged by tho&s;e &s;killed in phy&s;ics, and particu|larly hydraulics, to be not le&s;s ingenious than novel. Mr. Bu&s;hnel invented &s;everal other curious machines for the annoyance of the Briti&s;h &s;hipping, but from accidents, not militating again&s;t the philo&s;ophical prin|ciples, on which their &s;ucce&s;s depended, they but par|tially &s;ucceeded. He de&s;troyed a ve&s;&s;el in the charge of commodore Symmonds. One of his kegs al&s;o de|moli&s;hed a ve&s;&s;el near the Long I&s;land &s;hore. About Chri&s;tmas 1777, he committed to the Delaware river a number of kegs, de&s;tined to fall among the Briti&s;h fleet at Philadelphia; but this &s;quadron of kegs, having been &s;eparated and retarded by the ice, demoli&s;hed but a &s;ingle boat. This cata&s;trophe, however, produced an alarm, unprecedented in its nature and degree; which has been humourou&s;ly de&s;cribed by the late honourable Francis Hopkin&s;on, in a &s;ong, &s;tyled "The Battle of the Kegs."</P>
<P>The i&s;&s;ue of the campaign upon the Delaware af|forded room for the mo&s;t &s;erious reflections to the Briti&s;h. Their arms were crowned with the mo&s;t brilliant &s;ucce&s;s. Two very con&s;iderable victories were obtained. In all le&s;&s;er actions, excepting the affair at Red Bank, they were equally triumphant. Yet with all this tide of &s;ucce&s;s, all the fruit they derived from their victories at the clo&s;e of the campaign, amounted to no more than &s;imply a good winter lodging for their army in the city of Philadelphia; whil&s;t the troops po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no more of the adjacent country than what they immediately commanded with their arms. It was &s;till more di&s;couraging, that general Wa&s;hington had given repeated proofs that however he might engage them when he thought it to his advantage, it was im|po&s;&s;ible for the royal army to bring him to action a|gain&s;t
<PB N="165" REF="028963_0254_0FDDBF5DA08C2740">his con&s;ent. This gave occa&s;ion to much unea|&s;ine&s;s in Britain, where the news of the fir&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;es had cau&s;ed the greate&s;t exultation, which was now &s;uc|ceeded by very gloomy reflections on the peculiar and fatal circum&s;tances, which, from the nature of the country, and other operating cau&s;es, had di&s;tingui&s;hed this war, from all others in which they had ever been concerned, and in which victory and de&s;eat were near|ly productive of the &s;ame con&s;equences.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>ONE great object in the mini&s;terial plan for the campaign of 1777, was, to effect a free commu|nication between New York and Canada, and to main|tain the navigation of the intermediate lakes. On the other hand, the Americans were very early attentive to their &s;ecurity in that quarter, and had placed every po&s;|&s;ible ob&s;truction in their way.</P>
<P>This expedition had been projected by the Briti&s;h mini&s;try as the mo&s;t effectual method that could be taken to cru&s;h the colonies at once. The four provinc|es of New England had originally begun the confede|racy again Britain, and were &s;till con&s;idered as the mo&s;t active in the continuation of it; and it was thought, that any impre&s;&s;ion made upon them, would contribute in an effectual manner to the reduction of all the re&s;t. For this purpo&s;e, an army of 4000 cho&s;en Briti&s;h troops and 3000 Germans were put under the command of general Burgoyne; general Carleton was directed to u&s;e his intere&s;t with the Indians to per&s;uade them to join in this expedition; and the province of Quebeck was to furni&s;h large parties to join in the &s;ame. Tho&s;e who commanded under general Burgoyne were, gene|ral Philips of the artillery, generals Fra&s;er, Powell, and Hamilton, with the German officers generals Reide&s;el and Speecht, all officers of di&s;tingui&s;hed merit. The
<PB N="167" REF="028963_0255_0FDDBF636E9EC4C8">&s;oldiers were all excellently di&s;ciplined, and had been kept in their winter quarters with all imaginable care, in order to prepare them for the expedition on which they were going. The bra&s;s train of artillery that was &s;ent out, was perhaps the fine&s;t, and the mo&s;t excel|lently &s;upplied, both as to officers and men, that had ever been allotted to &s;econd the operations of an equal force. To aid the principal expedition, another was projected on the Mohawk River, under colonel St. Le|ger, who was to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;ir John John&s;on, &s;on to the famous &s;ir William John&s;on who had &s;o greatly di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the war of 1755.</P>
<P>A con&s;iderable force was left in Canada for its inter|nal &s;ecurity, and &s;ir Guy Carleton's authority was re|&s;tricted to the limits of that province. His military command extended before to every part of America, whither he might find it &s;itting to conduct the army under his direction. Though the Briti&s;h mini&s;try at|tributed the pre&s;ervation of Canada to his abilities, yet he was now called upon to act a &s;econdary part in &s;ub|&s;erviency to the grand expedition committed to general Burgoyne. His behaviour in this trying and difficult &s;ituation was conformable to the greatne&s;s of his &s;oul. He &s;hewed that re&s;entment could not warp him from his duty, and he applied him&s;elf with the &s;ame diligence and energy, to forward and &s;upport the expedition in all its parts, as if the arrangement had been entirely his own.</P>
<P>Lieutenant general Burgoyne arrived in Quebeck on the 6th of May,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>May</HI> 6.</NOTE> and exerted all diligence to pro&s;ecute in due time the objects of the expedition. He proceeded up Lake Champlain, and, on the 21&s;t of June, having landed near Crown Point,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>June</HI> 21.</NOTE> he encamped on the we&s;tern &s;ide of the lake, where being joined by a con&s;iderable body of Indians, the general made a &s;peech,
<PB N="168" REF="028963_0256_0FDDBF6454A6B288">in which it is &s;aid he exhorted the&s;e new allies, but in|effectually, to lay a&s;ide their ferocious and barbarous manner of making war; to kill only &s;uch as oppo&s;ed them in arms; and to &s;pare pri&s;oners, with &s;uch women and children as &s;hould fall into their hands. After i&s;&s;uing a proclamation, in which the force of Britain, and that which he commanded, was &s;et forth in very o&s;tentatious terms, the campaign opened with the &s;iege of Ticonderoga. The place was very &s;trong, and gar|ri&s;oned by 2546 continentals, and 900 militia, under general St. Clair; neverthele&s;s, the works were &s;o ex|ten&s;ive, that even this number was &s;carce &s;ufficient to defend them properly. They had therefore omitted to fortify a rugged eminence called <HI>Sugar Hill,</HI> the top of which overlooked and effectually commanded the whole works; imagining, perhaps, that the difficulty of the a&s;cent would be &s;ufficient to prevent the enemy from taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. On the approach of the fir&s;t divi&s;ion of the army, the provincials abandoned and &s;et fire to their out works; and &s;o expeditious were the Briti&s;h troops, that by the 5th of July every po&s;t was &s;ecured which was judged nece&s;&s;ary for inve&s;ting it completely.
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>July</HI> 6.</NOTE> A road was &s;oon after made to the very &s;ummit of that eminence which the Americans had &s;uppo&s;ed could not be a&s;cend|ed; and &s;o much were they now di&s;heartened, that they in&s;tantly abandoned the fort entirely, taking the road to Skene&s;borough, a place to the &s;outh of Lake George; while their baggage, with what artillery and military &s;tores they could carry off, were &s;ent to the &s;ame place by water. But the Briti&s;h generals were determined not to let them pa&s;s &s;o ea&s;ily. Both were pur&s;ued and both overtaken. Their armed ve&s;&s;els con|&s;ided only of five galleys; two of which were taken, and three blown up; on which they &s;et fire to their boats and fortifications at Skene&s;borough. On this oc|ca&s;ion
<PB N="169" REF="028963_0256_0FDDBF6454A6B288">the provincials lo&s;t 200 boats, 130 pieces of cannon, with all their provi&s;ions and baggage. Their land forces under colonel Francis made a brave defence again&s;t general Fra&s;er;
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>July</HI> 7.</NOTE> and &s;uperior in number, had almo&s;t overpowered him, when general Reide&s;el with a large body of Ger|mans came to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The Americans were now overpowered in their turn; and their commander being killed, they fled on all fides with great precipita|tion. In this action 200 were killed, as many taken pri&s;oners, and above 600 wounded, many of whom peri&s;hed in the woods for want of a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>During the engagement general St. Clair was at Ca&s;tleton, about &s;ix miles from the place; but in&s;tead of going forward to Fort Anne, the next place of &s;trength, he repaired to the woods which lie between that fortre&s;s and New England. General Burgoyne, however, detached colonel Hill with the ninth regi|ment, in order to intercept &s;uch as &s;hould attempt to retreat towards Fort Anne. On his way he met with a body of the Americans, &s;aid to be &s;ix times as number|ous as his own; but after an engagement of three hours, they were obliged to retire with great lo&s;s. After &s;o many di&s;a&s;ters, de&s;pairing of being able to make any &s;tand at Fort Anne, they &s;et &s;ire to it and retired to Fort Edward. In all the&s;e engagements the lo&s;s of killed and wounded in the royal army did not exceed 200 men.</P>
<P>General Burgoyne was now obliged to &s;u&s;pend his operations for &s;ome time, and wait at Skene&s;borough for the arrival of his tents, provi&s;ions, &amp;c. but employ|ed this interval in making roads through the country about St. Anne, and in clearing a pa&s;&s;age for his troops to proceed again&s;t the Americans. The direct di&s;tance from Fort Anne, where the batteaux navigation ended, or even from Skene&s;borough to Fort Edward, was no
<PB N="170" REF="028963_0257_0FDDBF65D23A4A50">more than what in ea&s;y ground, or a cultivated country, would be termed a moderate ride for exerci&s;e; yet &s;uch is the &s;avage &s;tate of that country, and &s;uch were the difficulties thrown in the way by the provincials, that the progre&s;s of the army thither was rendered very tedious and laborious; &s;carcely indeed exceeding one mile a day; a circum&s;tance, to after ages, and in a cultivated &s;tate of the country, perhaps hardly credible. Almo&s;t every part of the pa&s;&s;age was a wilderne&s;s. The provincials had cut large trees on both &s;ides of the road, in &s;uch a manner as to fall acro&s;s and lengthways, with their branches interwoven; &s;o that the troops had &s;everal layers of the&s;e frequently to remove, in places where they could not po&s;&s;ibly take an oppo&s;ite direction. The face of the country was likewi&s;e &s;o broken with creeks and mar&s;hes, that, in this &s;hort &s;pace, they had no fewer than forty bridges to con&s;truct, be&s;ides others to repair; one of which was of log work, two miles in length. In &s;hort, after undergoing the utmo&s;t dif|ficulty that could be undergone, and making every ex|ertion that man could make, he arrived with his army before Fort Edward about the end of July.
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>July</HI> 30.</NOTE> Here general Schuyler had been for &s;ome time endeavouring to recruit the &s;hattered American forces, and had been joined by general St. Clair with the remains of his army; the garri&s;on of Fort George al&s;o, &s;ituated on the lake of that name, had evacuated the place and retired to Fort Edward on Hud&s;on's River.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the great &s;ucce&s;s of the Briti&s;h general, the people, far from &s;hewing the lea&s;t di&s;po&s;i|tion to &s;ubmit, &s;eemed only to con&s;ider how they might make the mo&s;t effectual re&s;i&s;tance. For this purpo&s;e, the militia was every where rai&s;ed and draughted to join the army at Saratoga; and &s;uch numbers of vol|unteers were daily added, that they &s;oon began to
<PB N="171" REF="028963_0257_0FDDBF65D23A4A50">recover from the alarm into which they had been thrown.</P>
<P>The terror excited by the Indians, likewi&s;e, in&s;tead of di&s;po&s;ing any of the inhabitants to court the Briti&s;h protection, had a tendency directly oppo&s;ite. They had no other means of &s;ecurity, but to abandon their habitations and take up arms. The friends of the royal cau&s;e, as well as its enemies, &s;uffered from their indi&s;criminate barbarities. The murder of Mi&s;s M'Rea, e&s;pecially, excited univer&s;al horrour. This young lady, in the innocence of youth, and the bloom of beauty&mdash; &s;he daughter of a &s;teady loyali&s;t, and engaged to be married to a Briti&s;h officer, was, whil&s;t dre&s;&s;ed to re|ceive her promi&s;ed hu&s;band, murdered by her &s;avage conductors, the auxiliaries of the Briti&s;h army. Occa|&s;ion was thereby given to inflame the populace, and to blacken the royal cau&s;e. The cruelties of the In|dians and the cau&s;e in which they were engaged, were a&s;&s;ociated together, and pre&s;ented in one view to the alarmed inhabitants. This melancholy &s;tory, though true, was no premeditated barbarity. The circum&s;tan|ces were as follow: Mr. Jones, her lover, from an anxiety for her &s;afety, engaged &s;ome Indians to remove her from among the Americans, and promi&s;ed to re|ward the per&s;on who &s;hould bring her &s;afe to him, with a barrel of rum. Two of the Indians who had conveyed her &s;ome di&s;tance on the way to her intended hu&s;band, di&s;puted which of them &s;hould pre&s;ent her to Mr. Jones. Both were anxious for the reward; and one of them killed her with his tomahawk, to prevent the other from receiving it. General Burgoyne obliged the Indians to deliver up the murderer, and threatened to put him to death. His life was only &s;pared, upon the Indians agreeing to terms, which the general thought would be more efficacious than an execution, in preventing &s;imilar mi&s;chiefs.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="028963_0258_0FDD5F44473B0F18">
The wi&s;dom and propriety of general St. Clair's re|treat from Ticonderoga was &s;oon after evident, even to tho&s;e, who cen&s;ured his conduct; as the army, &s;aved by that means, &s;tood as a barrier between the inhabit|ants and general Burgoyne. This abated the panic of the people, and became a centre of rendezvous for them to repair to: And when an inquiry into his con|duct took place afterwards, all the charges again&s;t him were found groundle&s;s, and he was honourably acquit|ted. In the mean time general Gates was placed at the head of the northern army. At the &s;ame time general Arnold repaired to Saratoga with a con&s;iderable train of artillery; but receiving intelligence that colonel St. Leger was proceeding with great rapidity in his expe|dition on the Mohawk River, he removed to Still Wa|ter, a place about half way between Saratoga and the junction of the Mohawk and Hud&s;on's River.</P>
<P>Colonel St. Leger had advanced in the beginning of Augu&s;t as far as Fort Schuyler, formerly called Fort Stanwic; the &s;iege of which he pre&s;&s;ed with great vig|our. On the 6th of Augu&s;t, under&s;tanding that a &s;upply of provi&s;ions,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Aug.</HI> 6.</NOTE> e&s;corted by 800 or 900 men, under general Harkimer, was on the way to the fort, he di&s;patched &s;ir John John&s;on with a number of tories and Indians, who &s;urpri&s;ed the Americans and took the convoy. A &s;cene of great confu&s;ion followed. Some of Harkimer's men ran off, but others po&s;ted them&s;elves behind logs, and contin|ued to fight with bravery and &s;ucce&s;s. The lo&s;s on the &s;ide of the Americans was 160 killed, be&s;ides many wounded.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Briti&s;h accounts &s;tate 400 killed and 200 taken pri&s;oners. Dod&s;ley's Annual Regi&s;ter for 1777.</NOTE> General Harkimer was among the former. Several of the principal people in that part of the country were among the killed and wounded. Colo|nel Willet, the &s;econd in command in the fort, under
<PB N="173" REF="028963_0258_0FDD5F44473B0F18">general Gan&s;evoort, &s;allied out with 250 men, about the time of this battle, and routed two of the Indian and tory encampments, carrying off provi&s;ions, baggage, arms and five colours, which on their return to the fort were di&s;played under the continental flag.</P>
<P>Colonel St. Leger now endeavoured to induce the garri&s;on to &s;urrender, by &s;tating the impo&s;&s;ibility of their receiving relief, and threatening them in ca&s;e of re&s;i&s;tance; but the commander replied, that he was determined to defend it to the la&s;t extremity, again&s;t all enemies whatever, without any concern for the con&s;equences of doing his duty: And &s;o little were the garri&s;on intimidated, that colonel Willet and lieu|tenant Stockwell, pa&s;&s;ed by night through the be&s;iegers' works, and, eluding the vigilance of the enemy, made their way through the greate&s;t dangers and di&s;&s;icul|ties to ha&s;ten the march of general Arnold to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Thus the affairs of Colonel St. Leger &s;eemed to be in no very favourable &s;ituation notwith&s;tanding his late &s;ucce&s;s, and they were &s;oon totally ruined by the de&s;er|tion of the Indians. They had been alarmed by the report of general Arnold's advancing with 2000 men to the relief of the fort; and whil&s;t the colonel was attempting to give them encouragement, another report was &s;pread, that general Burgoyne had been defeated with great &s;laughter, and was now flying before the provincials. On this he was obliged to do as they thought proper; and the retreat could not be effected without the lo&s;s of the tents and &s;ome of the artillery and military &s;tores.</P>
<P>General Burgoyne, in the mean time, notwith&s;tand|ing all the difficulties he had already &s;u&s;tained, found that he mu&s;t &s;till encounter more. The roads he had made with &s;o much labour and pains were de&s;troyed, either by the wetne&s;s of the &s;ea&s;on or by the Ameri|cans;
<PB N="174" REF="028963_0259_0FDDBF674EDB5C28">&s;o that the provi&s;ions he brought from Fort George could not &s;trive at his camp without the mo&s;t prodigious toil. On hearing of the &s;iege of Fort Schuyler by colonel St. Leger, he determined to move forward, in hopes of enclo&s;ing the enemy betwixt his own army and that of St. Leger, or of obtaining the command of all the country between Fort Schuyler and Albany; or, at any rate, a junction with colonel St. Leger would be effected, which could not but be attended with the mo&s;t happy con&s;equences. The only difficulty was the want of provi&s;ions; and this it was propo&s;ed to remedy by reducing the provincial magazines at Bennington. For this purpo&s;e, colonel Baum, a German officer of great bravery, was cho&s;en with a body of 500 men. The place was about twenty miles from Hud&s;on's River; and to &s;upport colonel Baum's party, the whole army marched up the river's bank, and encamped almo&s;t oppo&s;ite to Saratoga, with the river betwixt it and that place. An advanced party was po&s;ted at Batten Kill, between the camp and Ben|nington, in order to &s;upport colonel Baum. In their way the Briti&s;h &s;eized a large &s;upply of cattle and pro|vi&s;ions, which were immediately &s;ent to the camp; but the badne&s;s of the roads retarded their march &s;o much, that inrelligence of their de&s;ign was &s;ent to Ben|nington. Under&s;tanding now that the American force was greatly &s;uperior to his own, the colonel acquainted the general, who immediately di&s;patched colonel Brey|man with a party to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but through the &s;ame cau&s;es that had retarded the march of colonel Baum, this a&s;&s;i&s;tance could not arrive in time. Gen|eral Starke, in the mean time, who commanded at Bennington, determined to attack the two parties &s;ep|arately; and for this purpo&s;e advanced again&s;t colonel Baum,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Aug.</HI> 16.</NOTE> whom he &s;urrounded on all &s;ides and attacked with the utmo&s;t
<PB N="175" REF="028963_0259_0FDDBF674EDB5C28">violence. The troops defended them&s;elves with great valour, but were to a man either killed or taken pri&s;on|ers; among the latter was colonel Baum. Colonel Breyman, after a de&s;perate engagement, had the good luck to effect a retreat through the darkne&s;s of the night, which otherwi&s;e he could not have done, as his men had expended all their ammunition, being 40 rounds to each. In the&s;e two actions the Americans took 4 bra&s;s field pieces, 12 bra&s;s drums, 250 dra|goon &s;words, 4 ammunition waggons, and about 700 pri&s;oners. The lo&s;s of the Americans, inclu&s;ive of their wounded, was about 100 men.</P>
<P>General Burgoyne, thus di&s;appointed in his attempt on Bennington, applied him&s;elf with indefatigable dili|gence to procure provi&s;ions from Fort George; and having at length ama&s;&s;ed a &s;ufficient quantity to la&s;t for a month, he threw a bridge of boats over the river Hud&s;on, which he cro&s;&s;ed about the middle of Septem|ber, encamping on the hills and plains near Saratoga. As &s;oon as he approached the provincial army, at this time encamped at Stillwater, under general Gates, he determined to make an attack; for which purpo&s;e he put him&s;elf at the head of the central divi&s;ion of his army, having general Fra&s;er and colonel Breyman on the right,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sept.</HI> 19.</NOTE> with generals Reide|&s;el and Philips on the left. In this po&s;ition he advanced towards the Americans on the 19th of September. But the Americans did not now wait to be attacked: on the contrary, they attacked the central divi&s;ion with the utmo&s;t violence; and it was not until general Philips with the artillery came up, and at 11 o'clock at night, that they could be induced to retire to their camp. In this action a continual blaze of &s;ire was kept up, and both armies &s;eemed to be determined on death or victory. The Americans and Briti&s;h al|ternately drove, and were driven by each other. Men,
<PB N="176" REF="028963_0260_0FDDBF69083DF858">and particularly officers, dropped every moment, and on every &s;ide. Several of the Americans placed them|&s;elves on high trees, and as often as they could di&s;tin|gui&s;h an officer's uniform, took him off by deliberately aiming at his per&s;on. The Briti&s;h troops lo&s;t about 500 in killed and wounded, and the Americans about 319. The former were very much alarmed at the ob|&s;tinate re&s;olution &s;hown by the Americans, but this did not prevent them from advancing towards them, and po&s;ting them&s;elves the next day within cannon &s;hot of their lines. But their allies the Indians began to de&s;ert in great numbers; and at the &s;ame time the general was in the highe&s;t degree mortified by having no intelligence of any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Henry Clinton,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sept.</HI> 21.</NOTE> as had been &s;tipulated. He now received a letter from him, by which he was informed that &s;ir Henry intended to make a di|ver&s;ion on the North River in his favour. This afford|ed but little comfort: however, he returned an an&s;wer by &s;everal tru&s;ty per&s;ons, whom he di&s;patched different ways, &s;tating his pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation, with in|&s;tructions to pre&s;s the immediate execution of the pro|po&s;ed co-operation, and mentioning that the provi&s;ions and other nece&s;&s;aries he had would only enable him to hold out till the 12th of October.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Americans, in order to cut off the retreat of the Briti&s;h army in the mo&s;t effectual manner, undertook an expedition again&s;t Ticonderoga; but were obliged to abandon the enterpri&s;e after hav|ing &s;urpri&s;ed all the out po&s;ts, and taken a great num|ber of boats, with &s;ome armed ve&s;&s;els, and a number of pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>The army under general Burgoyne, however, con|tinued to labour under the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;es; &s;o that in the beginning of October he had been obliged to
<PB N="177" REF="028963_0260_0FDDBF69083DF858">dimini&s;h the &s;oldiers' allowance. On the 7th of that month he determined to move towards the Americans.
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Oct.</HI> 7.</NOTE> For this purpo&s;e he &s;ent a body of 1500 men to reconnoitre their left wing; in|tending, if po&s;&s;ible, to break through it in order to ef|fect a retreat. The detachment, however, had not proceeded far when a dreadful attack was made upon the left wing of the Briti&s;h army, which was with great difficulty pre&s;erved from being entirely broken by a reinforcement brought up by general Fra&s;er, who was kill|ed in the attack, and, on account of his di&s;tingui&s;hed merit, was the &s;ubject of particular regret. After the troops had with the mo&s;t de&s;perate efforts regained their camp, it was mo&s;t furiou&s;ly a&s;&s;aulted by general Ar|nold; who, notwith&s;tanding all oppo&s;ition, would have forced the intrenchments, had he not received a dan|gerous wound, which obliged him to retire. Thus the attack failed on the left, but on the right the camp of the German re&s;erve was forced, colonel Breyman kill|ed, and his countrymen defeated with great &s;laughter, and the lo&s;s of 9 pieces of bra&s;s artillery and all their baggage. This day was fatal to many brave men. Sir James Clark, Burgoyne's aid de camp, was mortally wounded. The general him&s;elf had a narrow e&s;cape, a mu&s;ket &s;hot pa&s;&s;ing through his hat, and another through his wai&s;tcoat. Majors Williams and Ackland were taken, and the latter was wounded. The lo&s;s of the Americans was incon&s;iderable.</P>
<P>This was by far the heavie&s;t lo&s;s the Briti&s;h army had &s;u&s;tained &s;ince the action at Bunker's Hill. The li&s;t of killed and wounded amounted to near 1200, ex|clu&s;ive of the Germans; but the greate&s;t misfortune was, that the Americans had now an opening on the right and rear of the Briti&s;h forces, &s;o that the army was threatened with entire de&s;truction. This obliged general Burgoyne once more to &s;hift his po&s;ition, that
<PB N="178" REF="028963_0261_0FDDBF6F4DA4C470">his opponents might al&s;o be obliged to alter theirs. This was accompli&s;hed on the night of the 7th, with|out any lo&s;s, and all the next day he continued to offer the Americans battle; but they were now too well a&s;|&s;ured of obtaining a complete victory, by cutting off all &s;upplies from the Briti&s;h, to ri&s;k a pitched battle. Wherefore they advanced on the right &s;ide, in order to inclo&s;e him entirely; which obliged the general to di|rect a retreat towards Saratoga. But the Americans had now &s;tationed a great force on the ford at Hud|&s;on's River, &s;o that the only po&s;&s;ibility of retreat was by &s;ecuring a pa&s;&s;age to Lake George; and to effect this, a body of workmen were detached, with a &s;trong guard, to repair the roads and bridges that led to Fort Edward. As &s;oon as they were gone, however, the Americans &s;eemed to prepare for an attack; which rendered it nece&s;&s;ary to recal the guard, and the work|men being of cour&s;e left expo&s;ed, could not proceed.</P>
<P>The royal troops were under arms the whole day of the 8th,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Oct.</HI> 8.</NOTE> in continual expectation of an action, and were cannonaded during the greate&s;t part of it; but all that happened was a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;kir|mi&s;hes which occa&s;ioned lo&s;s on both &s;ides. General Lincoln was wounded in his leg by a random &s;hot, when riding in company with general Gates. About &s;un&s;et, a &s;trange &s;pectacle was pre&s;ented to view. The corp&s;e of general Fra&s;er was brought out of the unfor|tunate Briti&s;h camp, and carried up the hill, attended only by the officers who had lived in his family, for he de&s;ired it might be carried, without parade, by the fol|diers of his corps, to the great redoubt, and there bu|ried. It nece&s;&s;arily pa&s;&s;ed within view of both armies: generals Burgoyne, Philips, and Reide&s;el, &s;tanding to|gether, were unable to re&s;train their natural propen&s;ity to pay their la&s;t attention to his remains&mdash;jealous le&s;t their conformity to his reque&s;t might be con&s;trued into
<PB N="179" REF="028963_0261_0FDDBF6F4DA4C470">neglect&mdash;they followed the corp&s;e to the grave. The ince&s;&s;ant cannonading during the &s;olemnity;&mdash;the &s;tea|dy attitude, and unaltered voice with which the chaplain, Mr. Brudenell, officiated, though frequently covered with du&s;t, thrown up on all &s;ides of him by the &s;hot; &mdash;the mute but expre&s;&s;ive mixture of &s;en&s;ibility and indignation upon every countenance, together with the du&s;kine&s;s of the evening, might make one of the fine&s;t &s;ubjects for the pencil of a ma&s;ter that the field ever exhibited. But had general Burgoyne acquainted the American commander with the intended proce&s;&s;ion, there is no doubt but the magnanimity and genero&s;ity of general Gates would have varied the &s;cene, and done due honour to the memory of his brave enemy.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the boats which conveyed pro|vi&s;ions down Hud&s;on's River were expo&s;ed to the con|tinual fire of the American mark&s;men, who took many of them; &s;o that it became nece&s;&s;ary to convey the provi&s;ions over land. In this extreme danger, it was re&s;olved to march by night to Fort Edward, forcing the pa&s;&s;ages at the fords either above or below the place; and, in order to effect this the more ea&s;ily, it was re&s;olved that the &s;oldiers &s;hould carry their pro|vi&s;ions on their backs, leaving behind their baggage and every other incumbrance. But before this could be executed, intelligence was received that the Americans had rai&s;ed &s;trong intrenchments oppo&s;ite to the&s;e fords, well provided with cannon, and that they had likewi&s;e taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ri&s;ing ground between Fort George and Fort Edward, which in like manner was provided with cannon.</P>
<P>"On the morning of the 11th of October, general Gates called the general officers to|gether,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Oct.</HI> 11.</NOTE> and informed them of his having re|ceived certain intelligence, which might be depended upon, that the main body of Burgoyne's army was
<PB N="180" REF="028963_0262_0FDDBF7230027378">marched off for Fort Edward with what they could take, and that a rear guard only was left in the camp, who after a while were to pu&s;h off as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, leaving the heavy baggage behind. On this it was concluded to attack the camp in half an hour. The officers repaired to their commands. General Nixon's, being the elde&s;t brigade, cro&s;&s;ed the Saratoga creck fir&s;t. Unknown to the Americans, Burgoyne had a line form|ed behind a parcel of bru&s;h wood to &s;upport the po&s;t of artillery, where the others meant to make their at|tack. General Glover was on the point of following Nixon, when he &s;aw a Briti&s;h de&s;erter whom he ex|amined. The &s;oldier told him the truth, that the whole army was in camp; that a &s;mall detachment had been &s;ent off a day or two ago, but had returned, on finding the pa&s;&s;es occupied by the Americans. General Glover di&s;patched his aid de camp to general Gates with the de&s;erter behind him, and at the &s;ame time &s;ent a me&s;|&s;age to general Nixon, which reached him in the critical minute; before he could re-cro&s;s, the fog, which had prevailed, cleared off, and his rear was gall|ed by the enemy's cannon, which killed &s;everal of his men: a quarter of an hour later would proba|bly have proved fatal to his whole brigade, and giv|en a new turn of affairs in favour of the royal army. Thus the ri&s;e and fall of mighty empires may depend upon the minute&s;t incidents. Are the&s;e to be con&s;id|ered as blind unmeaning ca&s;ualties? Are they not rather the direct acts of a Divine Being, for the e&s;tab|li&s;hment of his own purpo&s;e, by a Providence &s;uperin|tending the jarring devices of mortals?</P>
<P>All this time the American army was increa&s;ing by the continual arrival of militia and volunteers from all parts. Their parties extended all along the oppo&s;ite bank of Hud&s;on's River, and &s;ome had even pa&s;&s;ed it in order to ob&s;erve the lea&s;t movement of the Briti&s;h
<PB N="181" REF="028963_0262_0FDDBF7230027378">army. The whole force under general Gates was com|puted at 16,000 men, whil&s;t the army under general Burgoyne &s;carce amounted to 6000; and every part of their camp was reached by the grape and rifle &s;hot of the enemy, be&s;ides a di&s;charge from their artillery, which was almo&s;t ince&s;&s;ant. In this &s;tate of extreme di&s;|tre&s;s and danger, the army continued with the greate&s;t con&s;tancy and per&s;everance till the evening of the 13th of October.
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Oct.</HI> 13.</NOTE> General Burgoyne finding that the troops had only three days provi&s;ion in &s;tore, on &s;hort allowance, and no apparent means of retreat remaining, called into council all the generals, field officers, and captains commanding corps. There was not a &s;pot of ground in the whole camp for holding the council of war, but what was expo&s;ed to cannon or rifle &s;hot. While the council was deliberat|ing, an eighteen pound ball cro&s;&s;ed the table. By the unanimous advice and concurrence of the council, the general was induced to open a treaty with general Gates. The fir&s;t propo&s;als of the latter were rejected, and the &s;ixth article with di&s;dain, wherein it was re|quired, that the Briti&s;h army &s;hould lay down their arms in the intrenchments. Burgoyne's counter pro|po&s;als were unanimou&s;ly approved; and being &s;ent to Gates were agreed to, on the 15th, without any mate|rial alteration. The propo&s;als not being &s;igned by either party, and captain Campbell returning in the night of the 16th to Burgoyne, with the news of the reduction of Fort Montgomery and other intelligence, the general &s;ubmitted it to con&s;ideration, whether it was con&s;i&s;tent with public faith, and, if &s;o, expedient to &s;u&s;pend the execution of the treaty, and tru&s;t to events. The opinion of different officers was a&s;ked in regard to the condition of their re&s;pective corps, and what might be expected from them &s;everally in de&s;per|ate ca&s;es. Some entertained doubts of part of the

On the morning of the 17th,

This done, he took out his watch, the time agreed upon for &s;igning being come; &s;ent colonel Greaton on hor&s;eback to Burgoyne with a me&s;&s;age, requiring the general to &s;ign; and al|lowed him no more than ten minutes to go and return. He was back in time. The treaty was &s;igned; all ho&s;tile appearances cea&s;ed; and the Americans ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|ed into their lines, to the tune of Yankee Doodle.</P>
<P>The terms granted were moderate: the army were allowed to march out with all the honours of war and its camp artillery, to the verge of the river, where they were to depo&s;it their arms. The troops were to be allowed a free pa&s;&s;age to Europe, on condition of their not &s;erying again in North America during the war. The army were not to be &s;eparated, particularly the men from the officers; roll calling, and other duties of regularity to be admitted; the officers on parole to be allowed to wear their &s;ide arms, and to be quartered according to their rank; all private property to be
<PB N="183" REF="028963_0263_0FDDBF73875482B8">held &s;acred, and the public delivered upon honour; no baggage to be &s;earched or mole&s;ted; all per&s;ons, of whatever country, appertaining to, or following the camp, to be fully comprehended in the capitulation; and the Canadians to be returned to their own country liable to its conditions. All the&s;e, as far as general Gates was or could be concerned, were executed with the utmo&s;t punctuality. Nay, &s;o much attention was paid to the delicacy of military honour, that when the Briti&s;h troops went to the place appointed to lay down their arms, the provincials were &s;trictly kept within their lines, and not allowed to be &s;pectators of &s;o great humiliation on the part of Britain. Such conduct was the more prai&s;e worthy, as &s;ome late as well as former circum&s;tances, had highly enraged the militia. The extraordinary and &s;evere mea&s;ures pur&s;ued by the Brit|i&s;h on the North River, as related below, might al&s;o have afforded much colour for a different mode of conduct.</P>
<P>When the arms were depo&s;ited agreeably to treaty, the royal troops were &s;erved with bread by the Ameri|cans, as they had none left, nor flour to make it. They had only one day's &s;alt meat remaining.</P>
<P>The number of tho&s;e who &s;urrendered at Saratoga amounted to 5791; the li&s;t of &s;ick and wounded left in the camp when the army retreated to Saratoga, to 528; and the number of tho&s;e lo&s;t by other accidents &s;ince the taking of Ticonderoga, to near 3000. 35 bra&s;s field pieces, 7000 &s;tand of arms, clothing for an equal number of &s;oldiers, with the tents, military che&s;t, &amp;c. con&s;tituted the booty on this occa&s;ion. The American forces, at the time of the convention, were in all 13,222, of which 4129 were militia. In commemoration of this event, congre&s;s voted that a gold medal &s;hould be &s;truck and pre&s;ented in the name of the United States to major general Gates.</P>

<P>Whether policy or revenge led to this de&s;truction of property is uncertain, but it cannot admit of a doubt, that it had no tendency to relieve general Burgoyne. General Gates had expre&s;s upon expre&s;s, urging him to &s;end down troops to oppo&s;e the ravages of the ene|my. On the 14th he wrote to governour Clinton; "I have ordered the commanding officer at Fort Schuy|ler to &s;end Van Shoak's regiment without delay to Albany&mdash;de&s;ired brigadier general Gan&s;evort to repair to that city, and take the command of all the troops that may a&s;&s;emble there&mdash;and have &s;ent down the two E&s;opus regiments, the Tryon county militia, and mo&s;t of the militia of Albany county." But he would not weaken his hold of Burgoyne by any detachment of continentals from his own army, or of New England militia.</P>

The pa&s;&s;age of the North River was made &s;o prac|ticable by the advantages gained on the 6th of October, that &s;ir Henry Clinton, with his whole force, amount|ing to full 3000 men, might not only have reached Al|bany, but general Gates's encampment, before the 12th; the day till which Burgoyne had agreed to wait for aid from New York, or at lea&s;t twenty four hours before Burgoyne's nece&s;&s;ity compelled his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to articles of capitulation. Why this opportunity was neglected has never been &s;atisfactorily explained. Whil&s;t general Vaughan was bu&s;ied in de&s;troying E&s;opus, he might with a flood tide have reached Albany in four hours, as there was no force to hinder him. Had he proceeded thither, and burnt the &s;tores, general Gates, as he him|&s;elf afterwards declared, mu&s;t have retreated into New England.</P>
<P>After the convention was &s;igned, general Gates mov|ed forward to &s;top the deva&s;tations of the Briti&s;h on the North River, but they, on hearing the fate of general Burgoyne, retired to New York. About the &s;ame time tho&s;e of the Briti&s;h who had been left in the rear of the royal army, de&s;troyed their cannon, and abandoning Ticonderoga, retreated into Canada. Thus the whole country, which had for &s;everal months experienced the confu&s;ions of war, was in&s;tantaneou&s;ly re&s;tored to per|fect tranquillity.</P>
<P>The intelligence of this great event &s;pread no le&s;s joy through the United States, than grief and dejection throughout Britain. The generality of the people in Britain had pre&s;umed that all the northern parts of the United States would be &s;ubdued before the end of the campaign. The quality of the troops, the zeal, talents and courage of the commander, together with the good fortune which for &s;ome time followed him, ju&s;tified their expectations in a great degree; but the cata&s;trophe proved the folly of planning di&s;tant expeditions, the
<PB N="186" REF="028963_0265_0FDDBF7660A56818">&s;ucce&s;s of which depended upon the coincidence of circum&s;tances, which were, at mo&s;t, only within the verge of po&s;&s;ibility.</P>
<P>When the captured troops began their march to Bo&s;|ton, the Americans lined the road and hill on each &s;ide. When pa&s;&s;ing through the centre of them, they were looked at, in this rever&s;e of fortune, with a generous &s;edatene&s;s; not even the lea&s;t ge&s;ture was made u&s;e of by way of in&s;ult. On their arrival at Bo&s;ton they were quartered in the barracks on Winter and Pro&s;pect Hills. The general court of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts pa&s;&s;ed proper re&s;o|lutions for the accomodation of pri&s;oners; but from the feeblene&s;s of their authority, at that time, over the property of their fellow citizens, it was difficult to pro|vide immediately for &s;o large a number of officers and &s;oldiers, in &s;uch a manner as their convenience requir|ed, or as from the articles of the convention they had a right to expect. The officers remon&s;trated to general Burgoyne, that &s;ix or &s;even of them were crowded to|gether in one room, without any regard to their re&s;pec|tive ranks, in violation of the 7th article of the conven|tion. Notice of this being forwarded to general Gates, he &s;ent general Burgoyne's letter to congre&s;s. Taking hold of the declaration of the general, that "the pub|lic faith was broken," and eager to ju&s;tify the mea&s;ures they were de&s;irous of adopting, they concluded from thence, that the captured troops, on their embarkation, would make a junction with the Briti&s;h garri&s;ons in A|merica. The declaration of the general, whil&s;t in the power of congre&s;s, was con&s;trued by them as de&s;troy|ing the &s;ecurity which they before had in his per&s;onal honour; alleging, that, in every event, he might ad|duce his previous notice to ju&s;tify his future conduct. They therefore po&s;tponed the embarkation of the troops, making a nice di&s;tinction between the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion and abrogation of the convention; and alleged, that ground
<PB N="187" REF="028963_0265_0FDDBF7660A56818">for &s;u&s;pecting an intention to violate it, was a ju&s;tifying rea&s;on for &s;u&s;pending its execution on their part, till it was properly ratified by the court of Great Britain. General Burgoyne explained the intention and con|&s;truction of the pa&s;&s;age objected to in his letter, and pledged him&s;elf that his officers would join with him in &s;igning any in&s;trument that might be thought nece&s;|&s;ary for confirming the convention; but congre&s;s would never recede from their re&s;olution. If was ea&s;ily &s;een, that the mea&s;ure which they had adopted was not &s;o lightly taken as to be ea&s;ily given up; and that expla|nations and &s;ecurities could produce no effect on their determination.</P>
<P>The capture of Burgoyne gave new &s;trength to the minority of the Briti&s;h parliament; prevented the gov|ernment there from acting with collected force, which an union of &s;entiments would have enabled it to do; encouraged the Americans by well grounded hopes of final &s;ucce&s;s, and &s;oon procured them powerful friends in Europe.</P>
<P>The American privateers and continental &s;hipping &s;ent in a number of Briti&s;h prizes into their own har|bours this year, and in&s;ulted the coa&s;t of Britain in a manner never before ventured upon by her hardie&s;t enemies; &s;o as to produce the appointment of a con|voy, for the fir&s;t time ever known, to protect the linen &s;hips from Dublin and Newry. The General Mifflin privateer, after making repeated captures, arrived at Bre&s;t, and &s;aluted the French admiral, who returned the &s;alute in form, as to the ve&s;&s;el of a &s;overeign and independent &s;tate. Though lord Stormont, on his threatening to return immediately to Great Britain, unle&s;s &s;atisfaction &s;hould be given, obtained an order for American privateers and their prizes to leave the French ports, the &s;ame was evaded. However, the king's &s;hips captured many valuable prizes in the
<PB N="188" REF="028963_0266_0FDDBF77DD499AB8">We&s;t Indies and on the American coa&s;t. But the balance of property was greatly in favour of the A|mericans. The continental frigate Hancock, of 32 guns, mo&s;tly twelve pounders, commanded by captain Manly, was taken on the 8th of July, by &s;ir George Collier, of his maje&s;ty's &s;hip the Rainbow. The Han|cock's complement was 290 men, nearly as many as the Rainbow's. The Flora frigate, likewi&s;e, gave chace to the Fox of 28 guns, on the 7th of July, and afterwards captured her. The Fox had been taken &s;ome time be|fore by captain Manly, on the banks of Newfound|land.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t of December the &s;hip Flamand, captain Landais, arrived at Port&s;mouth from Mar&s;eilles with a rich &s;upply of warlike &s;tores. Among other articles were 48 pieces of bra&s;s cannon, four pounders, with carriages complete, and 2000 balls; 19 nine inch mor|tars, with 250 bombs; a quantity of intrenching tools; 3000 fu&s;ees; 1100 of another quality for dragoons; 18,000 pounds of gun powder, and 61,000 of brim|&s;tone.</P>
<P>During this year and &s;ome time after, the views of a few factious men were bent on rendering the com|mander in chief unpopular, and thus pave the way for his removal from the command of the American army. But his fellow citizens had &s;uch unlimited and well grounded confidence in his patrioti&s;m and abilities, that the machinations of his enemies tended, in the end, only to e&s;tabli&s;h more firmly that authority which they indu&s;triou&s;ly laboured to &s;ubvert.</P>
<P>The plan &s;eems to have been to engage the Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts a&s;&s;embly and Virginia hou&s;e of burge&s;&s;es, to give in&s;tructions to their delegates in congre&s;s, to more for an inquiry into the cau&s;es of the ill &s;ucce&s;s of the campaign of 1776: and then contrive that &s;uch re|&s;olves
<PB N="189" REF="028963_0266_0FDDBF77DD499AB8">&s;hould be agreed to, as would either remove general Wa&s;hington or produce his re&s;ignation.</P>
<P>The following pa&s;&s;ages in two of the general's letters to a corre&s;pondent, who applied to him on this &s;ubject, are too valuable to be omitted. In the fir&s;t letter, dat|ed Valley Forge, January 23d, 1778, he writes "Wheth|er a &s;erious de&s;ign of placing general Lee (before cap|tivation) at the head of the army, had ever entered in|to the head of a member of congre&s;s or not, I never was at the trouble of enquiring. I am told a &s;cheme of that kind is now on foot by &s;ome, in behalf of anoth|er gentleman&mdash;whether true or fal&s;e&mdash;&s;erious or mere|ly to try the pul&s;e&mdash;I neither know nor care.

So &s;oon as the public gets di&s;&s;atisfied with my &s;ervices, or a per&s;on is found better qualified to an&s;wer her expectation, I &s;hall quit the helm with as much plea&s;ure, and retire to a private &s;tation with as much content, as ever the wea|ried pilgrim felt upon his &s;afe arrival at the holy land, or haven of hope; and &s;hall wi&s;h mo&s;t devoutly, that tho&s;e who come after may meet with more pro&s;perous gales than I have done, and le&s;s difficulty. If the ex|pectation of the public has not been an&s;wered by my endeavours, I have more rea&s;ons than one to regret it; but at pre&s;ent I &s;hall only add, that a day may come, when the public cau&s;e is no longer to be benefited by a concealment of our circum&s;tances, and till this peri|od arrives, I &s;hall not be among the fir&s;t to di&s;clo&s;e &s;uch

</ARGUMENT>
<P>SOON after the intelligence of the capture of Bur|goyne's army reached Europe, the king of France concluded at Paris treaties of alliance and commerce with the United States. This important tran&s;action was the fruit of long negociation. The coloni&s;ts had taken up arms, uninfluenced by the enemies of Great Britain, and conducted their oppo&s;ition for &s;everal months after they had rai&s;ed troops, without any reference to foreign powers. As they began the conte&s;t with no other view than to obtain a redre&s;s of grievances, they &s;hew|ed no inclination, in the fir&s;t period of their oppo&s;ition, to involve the mother country in a war, nor to a&s;k aid from her enemies. But when the policy of Great Britain attempted to deprive the Americans of arms, it became indi&s;pen&s;ible for them to &s;eek foreign con|nexions. For this purpo&s;e, Silas Deane was &s;ent to Paris, early in the year 1776, as a political and com|merical agent, with in&s;tructions to &s;olicit the friend&s;hip of the French king, Louis XVI. and to procure milita|ry &s;tores. Soon after his arrival, he was in&s;tructed to found count de Vergennes, the French mini&s;ter for foreign affairs, on the &s;ubject of the American contro|ver&s;y. In the month of June, Mr. Deane obtained a
<PB N="192" REF="028963_0268_0FDDBF7AD42C94D0">&s;upply of arms, ammunition, and &s;oldiers' clothing, &s;ufficient for loading three ve&s;&s;els. It is not yet pub|licly known what agency the court of France had in furni&s;hing the&s;e &s;upplies, or whether they were &s;old or given as pre&s;ents. However, the bu&s;ine&s;s was &s;o con|ducted, that it might a&s;&s;ume &s;uch a complexion as cir|cum&s;tances might render expedient. And, during the whole negociation, Great Britain was amu&s;ed with de|clarations of the mo&s;t pacific di&s;po&s;itions on the part of France, whil&s;t the Americans were &s;upplied with the means of defence.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s having agreed upon the plan of the treaty which they intended to propo&s;e to his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian maje&s;ty, elected Dr. Franklin, Silas Deane, and Ar|thur Lee to &s;olicit its acceptance. It was re&s;olved, that no member &s;hould be at liberty to divulge any thing more of the&s;e tran&s;actions than "that congre&s;s had taken &s;uch &s;teps as they judged nece&s;&s;ary for obtaining foreign alliances." The &s;ecret committee was directed to make an effectual lodgement of 10,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> &s;terling, &s;ubject to the order of the&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners. Dr. Franklin, who was employed as agent in the bu&s;ine&s;s, and afterwards as mini&s;ter plenipotentary at the court of France, enjoyed a greater proportion of foreign fame, than any other native of America. He was eminent|ly di&s;tingui&s;hed as a politician, and a &s;cholar, and, if po&s;&s;ible, more &s;o as a man and a citizen. His genius was va&s;t and comprehen&s;ive, and could with equal ea&s;e inve&s;tigate the my&s;teries of philo&s;ophy and the laby|rinths of politics. Shortly after his appointment he failed for France. His high rank in literature and his agreeable manners, had procured him the highe&s;t re|&s;pect and veneration when in that country, on his trav|els, in 1767; and now his increa&s;ed &s;ame &s;moothed the way for his reception in a public character. The three agents having rendezvou&s;ed at Paris, opened their
<PB N="193" REF="028963_0268_0FDDBF7AD42C94D0">bu&s;ine&s;s in a private audience with count de Vergennes on the 28th of December 1776. In&s;tead of gra&s;ping at too much, the French mini&s;ter aimed at nothing more than, by granting generous terms to the Ameri|cans, to perpetuate the &s;eparation of the colonies from Great Britain. France was at this period no way pre|pared for war. The peace of Europe was &s;uppo&s;ed to be un&s;table, from a prevailing belief that the death of the elector of Bavaria was an event extremely probable. But the principal rea&s;on that induced a delay, was an opinion, that the di&s;pute between the mother country and the colonies would be compromi&s;ed.</P>
<P>In the&s;e circum&s;tances the French court ob&s;erved a middle line of conduct. They avoided equally an haughty re&s;erve, which would have di&s;couraged the A|mericans, or a legal countenance of their deputies, which might, by alarming the rulers of Great Britain, have induced them to a compromi&s;e with their colonies, or have brought on an immediate rupture between France and England. The French government, there|fore, were not over ha&s;ty in openly e&s;pou&s;ing their cau&s;e. They prohibited, threatened, and even puni&s;hed the A|mericans; whil&s;t private per&s;ons were winked at, in encouraging, &s;upplying, and &s;upporting them.</P>
<P>The Americans in the mean time a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly em|ployed their agents at the courts of Spain, Vienna, Pru&s;&s;ia, and Tu&s;cany, in order, if po&s;&s;ible, to conclude alliances with them, or at lea&s;t to procure an acknowl|edgment of their independency. As it had been re|ported that Britain intended to apply for a&s;&s;i&s;tance to Ru&s;&s;ia, the American commi&s;&s;ioners were enjoined to u&s;e their utmo&s;t influence with the German princes to prevent &s;uch auxiliaries from marching through their territories, and to endeavour to procure the recal of the German troops already &s;ent to America. To France they offered a ce&s;&s;ion of &s;uch We&s;t India i&s;lands as
<PB N="194" REF="028963_0269_0FDDBF83DB1067E0">&s;hould be taken by the united &s;trength of France and A|merica; and &s;hould Britain by their joint endeavours be di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Newfoundland, Cape Breton, and Nova Scotia, the&s;e territories &s;hould be divided betwixt the two nations, and Great Britain be totally excluded from the fi&s;hery. The propo&s;als to the Spani&s;h court were, that in ca&s;e they &s;hould think proper to e&s;pou&s;e their quarrel, the American &s;tates &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t in reducing Pen&s;acola under the dominion of Spain, provided their &s;ubjects were allowed the free navigation of the river Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi and the u&s;e of the harbour of Pen&s;acola; and they further offered, that, if agreeable to Spain, they would declare war again&s;t Portugal, &s;hould that power expel the American &s;hips from its ports.</P>
<P>At this time the congre&s;s did not &s;o much expect any direct aid from France, as the indirect relief of a war between that country and Great Britain. To pro|mote which, they re&s;olved that "their commi&s;&s;ioners at the court of France &s;hould be furni&s;hed with war|rants and commi&s;&s;ions, and authori&s;ed to arm and fit for war in the French ports any number of ve&s;&s;els, not exceeding &s;ix, at the expence of the United States, to war upon Briti&s;h property, provided they were &s;atisfied this mea&s;ure would not be di&s;agreeable to the court of France." This re&s;olution was carried into effect, and, in the year 1777, marine officers, with American com|mi&s;&s;ions, both failed out of French ports, and carried prizes of Briti&s;h property into them. They could not procure their condemnation in the courts of France, nor &s;ell them publicly, but they found means to turn them into money.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t private agents on the part of the United States were endeavouring to embroil the two nations, the American commi&s;&s;ioners were &s;till urging the ac|ceptance of the treaty propo&s;ed by congre&s;s. They received a&s;&s;urances of the good wi&s;hes of the court of
<PB N="195" REF="028963_0269_0FDDBF83DB1067E0">France, but were frequently informed that the import|ance of the tran&s;action required farther con&s;ideration, and were enjoined to pre&s;erve the mo&s;t profound &s;e|cre&s;y. Matters remained in this uncertain &s;tate from December 1776 till December 1777. The defeat on Long I&s;land, the reduction of New York, and the di&s;|a&s;trous events of 1776, which have been already re|lated, &s;unk the credit of the Americans very low. The &s;ub&s;equent &s;ucce&s;&s;es at Trenton and Princeton effaced tho&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, but the fate of Burgoyne turned the &s;cale. This great event convinced the French, and might have convinced the Briti&s;h, that the oppo&s;ition of the Americans was not the work of a few factious leaders who had u&s;urped the reins of power, but that it was the work of the people, who&s;e efforts were likely to prove finally &s;ucce&s;sful. Louis, therefore, determin|ed to e&s;pou&s;e their cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The commi&s;&s;ioners of congre&s;s were informed, on the 16th of December, 1777, by M. Gerard, one of the &s;ecretaries of the king's council of &s;tate, "That it was decided to acknowledge the independence of the United States, and to make a treaty with them. That his mo&s;t chri&s;tian maje&s;ty de&s;ired the treaty once made &s;hould be durable, and their amity to &s;ub&s;i&s;t forever, which could not be expected, if each nation did not find an intere&s;t in its continuance, as well as in its commencement. It was therefore intended that the terms of the treaty &s;hould be &s;uch as the new formed &s;tates would be willing to agree to if they had been long &s;ince e&s;tabli&s;hed, and in the fulne&s;s of &s;trength and power; and &s;uch as they &s;hould approve of when that time &s;hould come. That his mo&s;t chri&s;tian ma|je&s;ty was fixed in his determination not only to ac|knowledge, but to &s;upport, their independence. That in doing this he might probably &s;oon be engaged in a war, yet he &s;hould not expect any compen&s;ation from
<PB N="196" REF="028963_0270_0FDDBF83E0AC4200">the United States on that account, nor was it pretend|ed that he acted wholly for their &s;akes, &s;ince be&s;ides his real good will to them, it was manife&s;tly the inter|e&s;t of France, that the power of England &s;hould be dimini&s;hed, by the &s;eparation of the colonies from its government. The only condition he &s;hould require and rely on would be, that the United States in no peace to be made, &s;hould give up their independence and return to the obedience of the Briti&s;h government."</P>
<P>Conformably to the preliminaries propo&s;ed by M. Gerard,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1778. <HI>Feb.</HI> 6.</NOTE> his mo&s;t chri&s;tian maje&s;ty Louis XVI. on the 6th of February, 1778, entered into treaties of amity and commerce with the United States of America, on the footing of the mo&s;t perfect equality and reciprocity; and copies of them were &s;ent to congre&s;s, in order to counteract any propo&s;als that might be made in the mean time by the Briti&s;h mini&s;try.</P>
<P>This event, though fore&s;een by many, and often foretold, was di&s;believed by the Briti&s;h mini&s;try; their zeal to reduce the colonies to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, blinded them to danger from any other quarter. Tran&s;ported with indignation again&s;t their late fellow &s;ubjects, they were &s;o infatuated with the American war, as to &s;uppo&s;e that the fear of future evils would induce the court of France to forego the opportunity of &s;ecuring great and immediate advantages, and at the &s;ame time, humbling a powerful rival.</P>
<P>The alliance between France and America had not been concluded three days before the Briti&s;h mini&s;ters were &s;ecretly acquainted with the unwelcome news; and eight days after, lord North introduced his concil|iatory propo&s;itions.
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Feb.</HI> 17.</NOTE> His plan was to enable the crown to appoint commi&s;&s;ioners to treat with the colonies concerning the means of putting an end to the pre&s;ent conte&s;t between

Five per&s;ons were to be inve&s;ted with ample powers; and authori&s;ed to treat with congre&s;s as a lawful a&s;&s;embly, repre&s;enting America&mdash;with any of the provincial a&s;&s;emblies&mdash; and with any individuals. They were to be empow|ered to order a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms; to &s;u&s;pend the operation of laws; and to grant pardons, immunities and rewards. The title of Independent States might be allowed till the treaty had been ratified by the king and parliament. The commi&s;&s;ioners were to negociate, upon a re-union of the empire, for a rea&s;onable contri|bution to its common exigencies; but this demand was not to be in&s;i&s;ted on, and to be given up rather than not terminate the quarrel.

Howe had been, in the late ac|tions and in the whole cour&s;e of the campaign, not only in the goodne&s;s of troops, and in all manner of &s;upplies, but al&s;o in point of numbers, much &s;uperior to the American army which oppo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed him in the field; that general Burgoyne had been in numbers, until the affair at Bennington, near twice as &s;trong as the army of the enemy: that he promi&s;ed a great army &s;hould be &s;ent out; and that a great army had accordingly been &s;ent out, to the amount of 60,000 men and up|ward. The &s;peech was long, able, and eloquent, and kept him up two full hours.&mdash;A dull melancholy &s;ilence for &s;ome time &s;ucceeded. It was heard with profound attention; but without a &s;ingle mark of approbation. A&s;toni&s;hment, dejection and fear, overclouded the whole a&s;&s;embly. It was conjectured that &s;ome power|ful motive had induced mini&s;try to adopt &s;uch an al|teration of mea&s;ures. The idea was confirmed by the po&s;itive a&s;&s;ertion of Mr. Fox, that a treaty had been &s;igned at Paris, between the colonies and France, by which &s;he recognized their independence. Some of the country gentlemen being piqued at lord North's
<PB N="198" REF="028963_0272_0FDDBF86D5E77BA0">having &s;aid, that "they had not been mi&s;led or de|ceived," ro&s;e with great warmth, and a&s;&s;erted with in|dignation, that they had been gro&s;sly deceived and mi&s;|led by the uniform language of government for three years pa&s;t. In general the party declared, that as the point of taxation, which could be the only rational ground of the war, was now given up, peace &s;hould be procured by any means, and in the &s;peedie&s;t man|ner."</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip &s;hould have early attended to the hints contained in the letter to Dr. Fothergill, which the doctor got tran&s;cribed and &s;ent him, but the mini&s;ter thought the doctor's corre&s;pondent too &s;anguine. The intimation that a foreign power might interfere, &s;hould have produced a determination to treat immediately&mdash; a me&s;&s;age to the American commi&s;&s;ioners a&s;&s;uring them of it&mdash;and the introduction, if po&s;&s;ible, of the pa&s;&s;ing of the conciliatory bills before the delivery of the preliminaries to the commi&s;&s;ioners on the 16th of December; whereas they were not pa&s;&s;ed till the 2d of March.</P>
<P>The day before the conciliatory propo&s;itions were introduced, a particular incident happened in the hou&s;e of lords. After the Saratoga convention, general Gates wrote a very pathetic and intere&s;ting letter to the earl of Thanet, with whom he had formerly lived upon a footing of great intimacy. It related chiefly to the &s;ituation of affairs between Great Britain and America. He lamented the misfortunes that had be|fallen his native country, and the danger to which it was expo&s;ed; and then &s;tated the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;peedily applying the only remedy remaining, for the cure of the many evils that afflicted or threatened Great Brit|ain. This remedy he declared to be an acknowledg|ment of American independence, which he &s;aid the United States never would part with. "A wi&s;e min|i&s;ter,"
<PB N="199" REF="028963_0273_0FDDBF9212032138">he added, "by re&s;cinding the re&s;olutions pa&s;&s;ed to &s;upport that &s;y&s;tem which no power on earth can e&s;tabli&s;h, will endeavour to pre&s;erve &s;o much of the empire in pro&s;perity and honour, as the circum&s;tances of the times, and the mal-admini&s;tration of tho&s;e who ruled before him, have left to his government. The United States of America are willing to be the friends, but never will &s;ubmit to be the &s;laves of the parent country. They are by con&s;anguinity, by language, and by the affection which naturally &s;prings from the&s;e, more attached to England than to any other country under the &s;un. Therefore &s;purn not the ble&s;&s;|ing which yet remains; in&s;tantly withdraw your fleets and armies; cultivate the commerce and friend&s;hip of America. Thus, and thus only can England hope to be great and happy. Seek that in a commercial alli|ance; &s;eek it ere it be too late; for there only you mu&s;t expect to find it." The earl of Thanet produced this letter in the hou&s;e; and after &s;ome controver&s;y it was read: and the duke of Richmond moved that it &s;hould lie upon the table. The motion was rejected after a warm debate, to the concern of &s;everal, who flattered them&s;elves that the letter might have afforded an opening to a favourable accommodation.</P>
<P>The conciliatory bills were hurried through both hou&s;es of parliament, and before they pa&s;&s;ed into acts, were copied and &s;ent acro&s;s the Atlantic, to lord and general Howe: and on their arrival, were &s;ent by a flag to congre&s;s at Yorktown, who were as yet uninformed of the conclu&s;ion of the treaty with France;
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>April</HI> 21.</NOTE> nor had they received any information from their commi&s;&s;ioners at Paris for upwards of a year. One packet had in that time been re|ceived, but the letters therein had been taken out before it was put on board the ve&s;&s;el which brought it from France, and blank paper put in their &s;tead. The com|mittee
<PB N="200" REF="028963_0274_0FDDBF92166C4F88">of congre&s;s appointed to examine the bills, made a report, which was unanimou&s;ly adopted. By this they rejected the propo&s;als of Great Britain.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s finding that the royal commi&s;&s;ioners were indu&s;triou&s;ly circulating the&s;e bills in a partial and &s;e|cret manner, ordered them to be printed in all the news papers, with the re&s;olutions of congre&s;s upon them, which were in &s;ub&s;tance as follows: That who|ver pre&s;umed to make a &s;eparate agreement with Brit|ain &s;hould be deemed a public enemy; that the United States could not with any propriety keep corre&s;pond|ence with the commi&s;&s;ioners until their independence was acknowledged, and the Briti&s;h fleet and armies removed from America. At the &s;ame time, the colo|nies were warned not to &s;uffer them&s;elves to be deceiv|ed into &s;ecurity by any offers that might be made; but to u&s;e their utmo&s;t endeavours to &s;end their quotas with all diligence into the field.</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion governour Tryon inclo&s;ed &s;everal copies of the bills to general Wa&s;hington, in a letter, entreating him to allow them to be circulated; to which the general returned for an&s;wer a copy of a news paper, in which the bills, together with the re&s;o|lutions of congre&s;s, were in&s;erted: and governour Trumbull, upon a &s;imilar letter and application, re|turned an an&s;wer to the following effect: There was a day when even this &s;tep, from the then ac|knowledged parent &s;tate, might have been accepted with joy and gratitude; but that day is pa&s;t irre|vocably; and there are in&s;uperable bars to the very idea of concluding a peace with Great Britain, on any other conditions, than the mo&s;t ab&s;olute, perfect, in|dependence.</P>
<P>The &s;ea&s;on for action was now approaching; and congre&s;s was indefatigable in its preparations for a new campaign, which it was confidently &s;aid would be the
<PB N="201" REF="028963_0274_0FDDBF92166C4F88">la&s;t. Among other methods taken for this purpo&s;e, it was recommended to all the young gentlemen of the colonies to form them&s;elves into bodies of cavalry to &s;erve at their own expence during the war. General Wa&s;hington at the &s;ame time, to remove all incum|brances from his army, lightened the baggage as much as po&s;&s;ible, by &s;ub&s;tituting &s;acks and portmanteaus in place of che&s;ts and boxes, and u&s;ing pack hor&s;es in&s;tead of waggons. On the other hand, the Briti&s;h army, ex|pecting to be reinforced by 20,000 men, thought of nothing but concluding the war according to their wi&s;hes before the end of the campaign. It was with the utmo&s;t concern, as well as indignation, therefore, that they received the news of lord North's concilia|tory bills. This m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ture was univer&s;ally looked upon as a national di&s;grace; and &s;ome even tore the cock|ades from their hats, and trampled them under their feet as a token of their indignation.</P>
<P>On the 3d of May, 1778, Mr. S. Deane arrived in America expre&s;s from France, and brought with him copies of the two treaties of alliance and commerce with France, to be ratified by congre&s;s. This joyful news was quickly announced to the people in a gazette, wherein the chief articles of the treaty were mentioned, together with the plea&s;ing accounts from other parts, &s;etting forth that almo&s;t all the European powers view|ed America with an eye of friend&s;hip. The treaties were duly weighed, and con&s;idered &s;eparately the next day, and upon each it was unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved, "That the &s;ame be, and is hereby accepted." The next re&s;olution was, That this congre&s;s entertain the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e of the magnanimity and wi&s;dom of his mo&s;t chri&s;tian maje&s;ty, &s;o &s;trongly exemplified in the treaty of amity and commerce; and the commi&s;&s;ioners repre&s;enting the&s;e &s;tates, at the court of France, are di|rected to pre&s;ent the grateful acknowledgments of this
<PB N="202" REF="028963_0275_0FDDBF921AEAB770">congre&s;s to his mo&s;t chri&s;tian maje&s;ty, for his truly magnanimous conduct re&s;pecting the&s;e &s;tates, in the &s;aid generous and di&s;intere&s;ted treaties, and to a&s;&s;ure his maje&s;ty, on the part of this congre&s;s, it is &s;incerely wi&s;hed, that the friend&s;hip &s;o happily commenced be|tween France and the&s;e United States may be per|petual."</P>
<P>The congre&s;s, after receiving the treaties, had a &s;tronger feeling of their own importance than before, and re&s;olved, "That the commi&s;&s;ioners appointed for the courts of Spain, Tu&s;cany, Vienna, and Berlin, &s;hould live in &s;uch &s;tyle and manner at their re&s;pective courts, as they may find &s;uitable and nece&s;&s;ary to &s;up|port the dignity of their public character."</P>
<P>On the eighth of May, they agreed to a draught of "An addre&s;s to the inhabitants of the United States of America." In this publication, when they come to the French treaty, they &s;ay, "You have &s;till to expect one &s;evere conflict. Your foreign alliances, though they &s;ecure your independence, cannot &s;ecure your country from de&s;olation, your habitations from plunder, your wives from in&s;ult or violation, nor your children from butchery. Foiled in the principal de&s;ign, you mu&s;t expect to feel the rage of di&s;appointed ambition. Ari&s;e then! to your tents, and gird you for battle! It is time to turn the headlong current of vengeance upon the head of the de&s;troyer. They have filled up the mea&s;ure of their abominations, and, like ripe fruit, mu&s;t &s;oon drop from the tree. Although much is done, yet much remains to do. Expect not peace, whil&s;t any corner of America is in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your foes. You mu&s;t drive them away from this land of promi&s;e, a land flowing indeed with milk and honey. Your brethren at the extremities of the con|tinent already implore your friend&s;hip and protection. It is your duty to grant their reque&s;t. They hunger
<PB N="203" REF="028963_0275_0FDDBF921AEAB770">and thir&s;t after liberty. Be it yours to di&s;pen&s;e to them the heavenly gift. And what is there to pre|vent it?"</P>
<P>The alliance between France and America was pub|licly announced to the Briti&s;h court, on the 13th of March, in a re&s;cript delivered to lord Weymouth, by the French amba&s;&s;ador: And the communication was made under the pretence of cultivating a good under|&s;tanding between France and Great Britain.</P>
<P>The reception of this re&s;cript was notified by the mini&s;ter to the hou&s;e of commons on the 17th; and was accompanied with a me&s;&s;age from the king, inti|mating that he &s;hould be under the nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;ent|ing &s;o unprovoked and &s;o unju&s;t an aggre&s;&s;ion on the honour of his crown and the e&s;&s;ential intere&s;ts of his kingdom, and expre&s;&s;ing his firm confidence on the zealous and affectionate &s;upport of his faithful people. An addre&s;s was moved for in an&s;wer to it, to a&s;&s;ure the king of the readine&s;s of the people to &s;tand by him in afferting the dignity of his crown, and the honour of the nation, and to &s;ubmit with cheerfulne&s;s and &s;pirit to the expen&s;es that would be requi&s;ite, which was car|ried after a long debate. In the hou&s;e of lords, the debates upon the like occa&s;ion were attended with an acrimony of language, and a freedom of thought, that &s;eemed to &s;corn all re&s;traint; but the que&s;tion for an addre&s;s was carried by a majority of near three to one.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t of March, a public audience and recep|tion was given to the American deputi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, Me&s;&s;rs. Franklin, Deane, and Lee, by the French monarch. They were introduced by Mr. Vergennes, and received by the king with the u&s;ual formalities and ceremonials. This &s;triking acknowledgment of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">enipotentaries from the United States, mu&s;t have mortified the mini&s;|try and crown of Great Britain; and may be pro|nounced the political phenomenon of Europe. The
<PB N="204" REF="028963_0276_0FDE9E2E8DFDC598">day before it was exhibited, the French amba&s;&s;ador, in con&s;equence of orders to quit London, &s;et out for Paris.</P>
<P>An inquiry into the &s;tate of the nation had been propo&s;ed &s;ome time back, and continued with unabat|ed a&s;&s;iduity in both hou&s;es. It was warmly contended by the members in oppo&s;ition, that the pre&s;ent mini&s;|try ought to be removed on account of their number|le&s;s blunders and mi&s;carriages in every in&s;tance. Sev|eral of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable members in oppo&s;ition, and even &s;ome of the oppo&s;ite party, were of opinion, that the only way to extricate the nation from its trouble was to acknowledge the independency of A|merica at once; and thus do with a good grace what mu&s;t inevitably be done at la&s;t, after expending much more blood and trea&s;ure than had yet been lavi&s;hed in this unhappy conte&s;t. Their independence, they &s;aid, was not only already e&s;tabli&s;hed, but had obtained &s;uch time to &s;ix and &s;ettle upon its foundations, that it ap|peared now too firm to be &s;haken by the utmo&s;t efforts of Britain, even &s;uppo&s;ing it were left, without any foreign &s;upport, merely to the exertions of its own in|ternal &s;trength. But in that &s;ituation, to form any hope of being equal to its overthrow, under the ac|knowledgment and &s;upport of the Hou&s;e of Bourbon, was, they &s;aid, an idea only fit to be entertained by bedlamites.</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion lord Chatham made his la&s;t and mo&s;t affecting &s;peech in the hou&s;e of lords, "My lords," &s;ays he, "the times are alarming; the &s;tate is indeed in danger! and nothing but the poor condition of my health could &s;o long have prevented me from at|tending to my duty in parliament at this very import|ant period. But advice is now &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, that al|though &s;orely pre&s;&s;ed by the hand of infirmity, I have made an effort, almo&s;t beyond my con&s;titution, to come
<PB N="205" REF="028963_0276_0FDE9E2E8DFDC598">down to the hou&s;e to give my be&s;t advice to your lord|&s;hips, and to expre&s;s my indignation at the pu&s;illanim|ous, the di&s;graceful idea of giving up the dependence of America on the &s;overeignty of Britain. Feeble as I am, I rejoice that I am yet alive, that the grave has not altogether clo&s;ed on me, before I had an opportu|nity of giving my vote again&s;t &s;o impolitic a mea&s;ure, as the acknowledgment of the independence of A|merica.</P>
<P>"That our public affairs have, for &s;ome years pa&s;t, been &s;hamefully managed, I have frequently endeavour|ed to convince your lord&s;hips; and although I con|demned the mea&s;ures which have for &s;ome time been adopted by the majority of this hou&s;e, yet I have been always again&s;t the independence of America, and nev|er would &s;upport mea&s;ures carried on in unrecanted error; but after a full recantation of the&s;e erroneous mea&s;ures, and after a repeal of all the oppre&s;&s;ive acts, it is the duty of every lever of his country, of every good citizen, to take care, while, on the one hand, he pre&s;erves the rights and privileges of the colonies, he does not, on the other, tarni&s;h the lu&s;tre of his royal ma&s;ter's crown, nor &s;ink the glory of the Briti&s;h nation. The tendency and plain language of the pre&s;ent motion is, to di&s;grace our &s;overeign, and to bring reproach up|on us as a nation. It is, in a manner, totally to anni|hilate this once great empire. I chu&s;e to &s;peak my &s;entiments, even though there may be danger in doing &s;o. I always hated re&s;erve; and never did approve of halting between two opinions, when there was no mid|dle path to &s;teer with certainty. The perfidy of France ought to rou&s;e us, and make us &s;train every nerve, open every vein, to pre&s;erve our national charac|ter, and to pre&s;erve us from being &s;coffed and laughed at by foreigners. It is now ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to de|clare for peace or war; and when the former cannot
<PB N="206" REF="028963_0277_0FDE9E30DF336D40">be pre&s;erved with honour, the latter ought to be com|menced without he&s;itation. What is life without rep|utation? And does that per&s;on de&s;erve the name of a <HI>man,</HI> of an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> who would not lay down his life, to pre&s;erve the ancient dignity of his country? We may po&s;&s;ibly fail in the attempt, but &s;till let us make an effort, one united effort, to prevent &s;uch national di&s;grace. If we fall in the attempt, Europe will at lea&s;t be convinced, that we had as much virtue left as to fall like men.</P>
<P>"But, it is &s;aid, we ought to make peace with A|merica on any terms, and bring home our troops in or|der to protect our&s;elves; in &s;hort, that we &s;hould al|low a foreign amba&s;&s;ador in&s;olently to tell <HI>us,</HI> that his ma&s;ter had made a bargain for that commerce which was <HI>our</HI> natural right, and entered into a treaty with <HI>our own</HI> &s;ubjects, without &s;o much as re&s;enting it.&mdash; Merciful God! to what a low ebb mu&s;t this once great empire be now reduced, when any of her &s;enators (pointing to the duke of Richmond) can rai&s;e up his head, and with a grave face openly hold forth &s;uch tim|id, &s;uch da&s;tardly coun&s;els?&mdash;This never was the lan|guage of Britain, and never &s;hall be mine.&mdash;What! can it be po&s;&s;ible that we are the &s;ame people, who a|bout &s;ixteen years ago were the envy and admiration of all the world? Is not this England?&mdash;Is not this the &s;enate of Great Britain? And can we forget that we are Engli&s;hmen? Can we have forgot that the nation has &s;tood the Dani&s;h irruptions&mdash;the Scotch inroads&mdash; the Norman conque&s;ts&mdash;the Spani&s;h armada&mdash;and the various efforts of the Bourbon compacts?&mdash;Why are we blinded by de&s;pair? Why &s;hould we &s;it down in ig|nominious tamene&s;s; and, with a de&s;ponding face, &s;ay to France, "Take from us what you will; take all we have; but do, pray, let us live and die in peace."&mdash; Shame upon &s;uch di&s;graceful, &s;uch pitiful coun&s;els!
<PB N="207" REF="028963_0277_0FDE9E30DF336D40">My God! How are we altered! What can have occa|&s;ioned &s;o &s;udden an alteration? Is the king &s;till the &s;ame? I hope he is; but I fear there is &s;omething in the dark, &s;omething rotten near him, &s;omething lurking between him and his people, which has thus di&s;mem|bered his empire, and tarni&s;hed his glory. But I tru&s;t that we have &s;till re&s;ources, and &s;till have courage to puni&s;h the perfidy of France. Why then &s;hould we now give up all? and that too without a blow; with|out an attempt to re&s;ent the in&s;ults offered to us? If France and Spain are for war, why not try the i&s;&s;ue with them? For, I again &s;ay, if we &s;hould fall in the attempt, let us fall decently; and if we cannot live with honour, let us die like men.

<P>"At pre&s;ent I cannot point out the means for car|rying on the war; but I wi&s;h to recall to your lord&s;hips remembrance, the extent and revenue of the crown when king George III. came to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it.

<P>He then a&s;&s;erted the American provinces to be the inheritance of the crown, which the hou&s;e had no right to vote away: And that before he would give his con|&s;ent to the pre&s;ent motion, the ri&s;ing hopes of the roy|al blood &s;hould be brought to the hou&s;e of lords to grant their con&s;ent to giving up what they have a legal and natural right to expect to po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>

<P>The duke of Richmond, after pa&s;&s;ing the highe&s;t compliments on the great &s;ucce&s;s of lord Chatham's admini&s;tration, appealed to the noble lord him&s;elf if &s;uch &s;ucce&s;&s;es could be attained, even by the talents of a Chatham, una&s;&s;i&s;ted by circum&s;tances. Could he ob|tain
<PB N="209" REF="028963_0278_0FDE9E3267D67C80">a conque&s;t without means, without an army, with|out a navy, without money, without a revenue, with|out credit? He begged leave to recal to the noble lord's memory, that, when he was called to the management of affairs, the empire was in a flouri&s;hing &s;tate; the finances were delivered to him in the highe&s;t &s;tate of improvement to which the abilities of a Pelham could rai&s;e them. The national debt was &s;eventy millions le&s;s when he came to the helm than when he left it. Could any analogy be deduced from tho&s;e times to the pre|&s;ent? America was then with us; &s;he is now again&s;t us. Our commerce was then extended and profitable; we have &s;ince lo&s;t the mo&s;t profitable branches of our trade. The African trade was dimini&s;hed &pound;1,400,000 a year. Our merchant &s;hips were now de&s;troyed by tho&s;e who then protected and employed them. We have lo&s;t &s;hipping to the value of &pound;2,600,000 in the conte&s;t with America, as had been proved at their lord|&s;hip's bar. The&s;e were circum&s;tances unknown in other times, and required new mea&s;ures. The brave&s;t princes, and the proude&s;t &s;tates, have been obliged to temporize, and &s;ubmit to circum&s;tances; and this was a moment for us to imitate them. But, in fact, what was the &s;hocking humiliation? Acknowledge the inde|pendence of America, and you have no farther quarrel with France. And what was the mighty difference between <HI>dependence</HI> and <HI>independence?</HI> It was a quarrel about words, a mere difference about &s;ounds: For, if we gave up taxation, if we gave up the appointment of governours, and other officers in the provinces, if we did not in&s;i&s;t on keeping up a &s;tanding army there, they would only &s;tand bound to us by inclination and intere&s;t, and the name of <HI>dependence</HI> and <HI>independence</HI> could only be de&s;crip|tive of the &s;ame connexion. He might be called da&s;tardly and pu&s;illanimous, for advi&s;ing peace; but he would &s;hew his courage, by per&s;i&s;ting in the &s;ame plan, in
<PB N="210" REF="028963_0279_0FDE9E33EC7C32E8">&s;pite of &s;uch painful and unde&s;erved appellations; and he held him&s;elf amply ju&s;tified in wi&s;hing to &s;ave his country, by recommending a pacification on any terms, when &s;o great a man as lord Chatham had publicly de|clared, he did not know the means of &s;aving it by mak|ing war. The mini&s;ters who had advi&s;ed the violent mea&s;ures again&s;t America, were the per&s;ons who had deprived the heirs of the crown of their inheritance, and not tho&s;e who recommended a &s;alutary acquie&s;c|ence under the lo&s;&s;es which they had rendered inevita|ble, and which mu&s;t increa&s;e by re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Lord Chatham ro&s;e to reply; but, after two or three un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts to &s;tand, fell down in a &s;woon on his &s;eat. Being carried out he recovered a little, but continued in a langui&s;hing condition till the 12th of May, when he expired, in the 70th year of his age; and left behind him the character of one of the great|e&s;t orators and &s;tate&s;men that any country has ever pro|duced. His remains were interred at the public ex|pen&s;e; and both parties &s;eemed inclined to make a|mends, by the honours they paid to his memory, for the neglect with which he had been treated during the latter part of his life.</P>
<P>When the &s;entiments expre&s;&s;ed in the la&s;t &s;peech of lord Chatham are con&s;idered, it cannot appear any way extraordinary that inferior politicians, and the great body of the people, fo&s;tered prejudices to a &s;till great|er extent, concerning the dependency of the colonies on the mother country; or that the point of honour, which had before precipitated the nation into the war, now predominated over every &s;ugge&s;tion of prudence and intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Accordingly the king and parliament of Great Brit|ain determined at once to re&s;ent the arrogance of France, and pro&s;ecute ho&s;tilities with America, with more vig|our than ever, &s;hould the terms now offered be rejected.</P>

From this time the Briti&s;h and French were bu&s;ied in fitting out their re&s;pective fleets. Though war was not actually declared, yet there could be no doubt but that the&s;e rival nations were in a &s;tate of ho&s;tility. A French &s;quadron, con&s;i&s;ting of 12 &s;hips of the line and 4 frigates,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>April</HI> 13.</NOTE> commanded by count D'E&s;taing, &s;ailed from Toulon for America, on the 13th of April. On the 4th of May authentic intelligence of the &s;ailing of the French fleet arrived at St. James's. On the 8th, a fleet of 12 &s;ail of the line was ready for &s;ea, under admirals Byron and Hyde Parker. A foul wind detained them until the 20th, when they &s;ailed from Port&s;mouth. The Briti&s;h min|i&s;try, being uncertain whither D'E&s;taing's &s;quadron was de&s;tined, &s;ent an expre&s;s with orders for the return of the fleet, &s;o that they put into Plymouth. At length, on the 5th of June they were relieved from their doubts; and admiral Byron &s;et &s;ail on the 9th, for A|merica, to command in that &s;tation, in the room of lord Howe, who had required permi&s;&s;ion to re&s;ign.</P>
<P>The fleet de&s;tined for the defence of the i&s;land of Great Britain was put under the command of admiral Keppel, an officer of di&s;tingui&s;hed merit; that of France was conducted by admiral D'Orvilliers.</P>
<P>The fleets met on the 27th of July, when a running fight took place, but no deci&s;ive action. Admiral Keppel was afterwards accu&s;ed of not having done his duty, by admiral Palli&s;er, the &s;econd in command. He was therefore tried, but was honourably acquitted. Palli&s;er him&s;elf was likewi&s;e tried for di&s;obedience of orders, and was partly acquitted and partly condemned. The event of this engagement became a &s;ource of &s;e|vere critici&s;m in Britain; and the arguments were car|ried on with a warmth and vehemence that &s;et the whole nation into a ferment of the mo&s;t outrageous nature. Such was the height of pa&s;&s;ion that prevailed
<PB N="212" REF="028963_0280_0FDE9E3CDD433218">through all cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety, that the critical circum|&s;tances of the nation were wholly forgotten, and the attention of the public was entirely ab&s;orbed in this di&s;pute. The di&s;content originating from this engage|ment had another very &s;erious effect. The mini&s;try were at a lo&s;s to get an officer to head the navy. Sir Charles Hardy, an able commander, but who had been twenty years retired from actual &s;ervice, was appointed, rather becau&s;e nobody el&s;e would accept of it, than any great expectations of his activity or &s;ucce&s;s. Nothing of con&s;equence happened during his com|mand, but &s;ome unavailing parades of the French fleet in the Channel, without effecting or &s;eeming to wi&s;h the attempting any thing.</P>
<P>General &s;ir Henry Clinton arrived at Phil|adelphia,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>May</HI> 8.</NOTE> on the 8th of May, to take the com|mand of the army, in the room of &s;ir William Howe; who returned to England, to the great regret of the Briti&s;h officers and &s;oldiery in general. In the beginning of June, the three commi&s;&s;ioners from Brit|ain, being the earl of Carli&s;le, Mr. Eden, and governour John&s;tone, arrived in the Delaware, and joined &s;ir Hen|ry Clinton, who was included in the commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The commi&s;&s;ioners immediately di&s;patched a letter, with the acts of parliament, a copy of their commi&s;&s;ion,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>June</HI> 9.</NOTE> and other papers, to the pre&s;i|dent of the congre&s;s; but their &s;ecretary, Dr. Adam Fergu&s;on, who was intended to convey the papers and to act as an agent for conducting the ne|gociation upon the &s;pot with the congre&s;s, being re|fu&s;ed a pa&s;&s;port for that purpo&s;e, they were obliged to forward them by common means.</P>
<P>The commi&s;&s;ioners propo&s;ed, even at this out&s;et, &s;ev|eral conce&s;&s;ions and arrangements, which, at an earlier period would have re&s;tored peace and felicity to the whole empire. They offered to con&s;ent to an imme|diate

<P>The commi&s;&s;ioners, not being aware that the &s;tyle and manner of thinking in the United States had un|dergone a far greater revolution than that of the gov|ernment, and that with their new &s;ituation new attach|ments had taken place, vainly endeavoured, in their letter, to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s congre&s;s with the ancient national antipathy to France.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="028963_0281_0FDE9E4424600AD0">
A decided negative having been already given, pre|vious to the arrival of the Briti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners, to the overtures contained in the conciliatory bills, there was little ground left for farther deliberation: and al|though the&s;e papers produced very con&s;iderable de|bates, which were renewed on different days, from the 11th to the 17th of June, in the congre&s;s, yet the an|&s;wer which they returned, through the medium of their pre&s;ident, Henry Laurens, <ABBR>e&s;q.</ABBR> was &s;ufficiently brief, however conclu&s;ive. They ob&s;erved to the com|mi&s;&s;ioners, that, nothing but an earne&s;t de&s;ire to &s;pare the farther effu&s;ion of human blood could have induced them to read a paper containing expre&s;&s;ions &s;o di&s;re&s;|pectful to his mo&s;t chri&s;tian maje&s;ty, the good and great ally of the&s;e &s;tates, or to con&s;ider propo&s;itions &s;o derogatory to the honour of an independent nation. They ob&s;erved, that the acts of the Briti&s;h parliament, the commi&s;&s;ion from their &s;overeign, and their letter, &s;uppo&s;ed the people of the&s;e &s;tates to be &s;ubjects of the crown of Great Britain, and were founded on the idea of dependence, which was totally inadmi&s;&s;ible. They informed them that they were inclined to peace, not|with&s;tanding the unju&s;t claim from which the war originated, and the &s;avage manner in which it had been conducted. They would therefore be ready to enter upon the con&s;ideration of a treaty of peace and commerce, not incon&s;i&s;tent with treaties already &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting, when the King of Great Britain &s;hould demon|&s;trate a &s;incere di&s;po&s;ition for that purpo&s;e. But the only &s;olid proof of that di&s;po&s;ition would be an explicit acknowledgment of the independence of the&s;e &s;tates, or the withdrawing of his fleets and armies.</P>
<P>Such were the conditions which a concurrence of events induced on the one &s;ide, and which the opera|tion of the &s;ame cau&s;es rendered inadmi&s;&s;ible on the other. The congre&s;s, at the &s;ame time, i&s;&s;ued an unan|imous
<PB N="215" REF="028963_0281_0FDE9E4424600AD0">approbation of general Wa&s;hington's conduct in refu&s;ing a pa&s;&s;port to Dr. Fergu&s;on.</P>
<P>Although the congre&s;s, as a body, did not enter into any litigation with the commi&s;&s;ioners upon the general &s;ubject of their mi&s;&s;ion, yet &s;ome of their members, particularly Mr. Drayton, one of the delegates for South Carolina, and others, perhaps not officially con|nected with them, entered the li&s;ts of controver&s;y in the public papers, with no &s;mall degree of acrimony as well as ability. For, as the commi&s;&s;ioners &s;eemed to carry along with them an idea, which at the time of their appointment, was endeavoured with great care to be e&s;tabli&s;hed in Britain, viz. "that the bulk of the Americans were well affected to the Briti&s;h govern|ment, and that the greater part of the remainder were only held in a &s;tate of delu&s;ion by the congre&s;s," they accordingly, upon the failure of their negociation with that body, directed their future publications in the manner of appeals to the people at large; &s;eeming thereby to realize in &s;ome degree, the charge &s;o repeat|edly made by their antagoni&s;ts, that their only object was under the in&s;idious appearance of conciliation, to excite either a &s;eparation among the colonies, or the people to tumult again&s;t their re&s;pective governments. And, as the congre&s;s not only permitted, but affected to forward, the publication of all matters upon the &s;ub|ject, &s;o the writers already mentioned, undertook to obviate the effect which tho&s;e i&s;&s;ued by the commi&s;&s;ion|ers might have upon the people at large.</P>
<P>The &s;tronge&s;t argument which they held out upon this occa&s;ion to the people was, that as they had already concluded a &s;olemn treaty with France, on the footing of, and for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of their independency&mdash; that if they now treated with the commi&s;&s;ioners upon the ground of dependence, they &s;hould at once break their faith with France, forfeit their credit with all
<PB N="216" REF="028963_0282_0FDE9E45A7E31EE0">foreign nations, be con&s;idered as a faithle&s;s and infa|mous people, and for evermore be cut off even from the hope of foreign &s;uccour or re&s;ource. At the &s;ame time they would be thrown totally on the mercy of tho&s;e who had already pur&s;ued every mea&s;ure of fraud, force, cruelty, and deceit for their de&s;truction; as neither the king, the mini&s;ters, nor the parliament of Britain, would be under a nece&s;&s;ity of ratifying any one condition which they might agree upon with the commi&s;|&s;ioners, or if they found it nece&s;&s;ary to ratify them for pre&s;ent purpo&s;es, it would be only to call a new par|liament to undo the whole. Nothing, they &s;aid, could be tru&s;ted to an enemy whom they had already found &s;o faithle&s;s, and &s;o ob&s;tinately per&s;evering in malice and cruelty. The fraudulent intention of the propo&s;ed negociation, they &s;aid, was &s;trongly evinced, by the commi&s;&s;ioners' holding out conditions which went far beyond their avowed powers; being neither warranted by the commi&s;&s;ion, nor by the acts of parliament which they pre&s;ented.</P>
<P>The peremptory denial of congre&s;s to the fir&s;t offers of accommodation not only proved very morti|fying to the commi&s;&s;ioners, but excited their re&s;ent|ment to no &s;mall degree. The individuals with whom they conver&s;ed on the &s;ubject of the conciliatory bill, generally returned for an&s;wer, that the day of recon|ciliation was pa&s;t; and that the haughtine&s;s of Britain had extingui&s;hed all filial regard in the brea&s;ts of the Americans. In their attempts to treat with the people at large, governour John&s;tone di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf be|yond all the other commi&s;&s;ioners, by endeavouring to obtain the object on which he had been &s;ent, by open|ing a private corre&s;pondence with &s;ome of the mem|bers of congre&s;s, or other influential characters, and drew upon him&s;elf of con&s;equence, a greater &s;hare of the re&s;entment of congre&s;s. They accu&s;ed him as a
<PB N="217" REF="028963_0282_0FDE9E45A7E31EE0">&s;py, who&s;e only view was to &s;ow di&s;&s;en&s;ion among them; nay, who had attempted to bribe Jo&s;eph Reed, <ABBR>e&s;q.</ABBR> Robert Morris, <ABBR>e&s;q.</ABBR> al&s;o George Wa&s;hington, <ABBR>e&s;q.</ABBR> and pre&s;ident Laurens, to de&s;ert the cau&s;e of their country, and betray it to the Briti&s;h; ab&s;olutely refu&s;|ing, at the &s;ame time, to have any connexion with him as a commi&s;&s;ioner. The proceedings in this bu&s;ine&s;s were expre&s;&s;ed in the form of a declaration, a copy of which was ordered to be &s;igned by the pre&s;ident, and &s;ent by a flag to the commi&s;&s;ioners at New York.</P>
<P>The&s;e proceedings produced a very angry and vio|lent declaration from governour John&s;tone, in which the immediate operations of pa&s;&s;ion and di&s;appointment were too con&s;picuous. The language of his publica|tion but poorly agreed with the high and flattering compliments he had &s;o lately lavi&s;hed on the Ameri|cans in tho&s;e very letters which were laid before con|gre&s;s, and which were the &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent conte&s;t. It was dated the 26th of Augu&s;t, and tran&s;mitted to congre&s;s; together with a declaration of the &s;ame date from lord Carli&s;le, &s;ir Henry Clinton, and Mr. Eden, which went to a &s;olomn and total di&s;avowal, &s;o far as as related to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, of their having had any knowledge, directly or indirectly, of tho&s;e matters &s;pecified by congre&s;s.</P>
<P>Thus were all hopes of further negociation with con|gre&s;s at an end. And the i&s;&s;ue of this la&s;t effort which Great Britain made by way of negociation, to regain her colonies, convinced France of the &s;incerity of her ally, and promi&s;ed to &s;ecure the &s;ucce&s;s of her favourite &s;cheme, to le&s;&s;en the power of Great Britain, beyond the reach of accident.</P>
<P>It would &s;well this work to an enormous &s;ize, were we to enter minutely into the paper war which en&s;ued: we &s;hall therefore now proceed to give an account of

<P>In the beginning of the year, &s;ome &s;ucce&s;sful preda|tory excur&s;ions had been made by the Briti&s;h into the Jer&s;eys, and on the banks of the Delaware, by which the Americans &s;u&s;tained a prodigious lo&s;s. In one of the&s;e, the Briti&s;h de&s;troyed at Bordentown four &s;tore hou&s;es; and before their return to Philadelphia they burned two frigates, nine &s;hips, &s;ix privateer &s;loops, twenty three brigs, with a number of &s;loops and &s;chooners.</P>
<P>In the end of May, an excur&s;ion from Rhode I&s;land was made by 500 Briti&s;h and He&s;&s;ians, un|der the command of lieutenant colonel Campbell.
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>May</HI> 25.</NOTE> The&s;e having landed in the night, marched next morning in two bodies, the one for Warren, the other for the head of Kickemuet Riv|er. They de&s;troyed about 70 flat bottomed boats, and burned a quantity of pitch, tar, and plank. They al&s;o &s;et fire to the meeting hou&s;e at Warren, and &s;even dwelling hou&s;es. At Bri&s;tol they burned the church and 22 hou&s;es. Several other hou&s;es were plundered, and &s;ome of the &s;oldiers &s;tripped the women of their &s;hoe buckles, gold rings, and handkerchiefs. They carried off peaceable and defencele&s;s inhabitants of the country, to be exchanged for an equal number of &s;ol|diers taken on their &s;ide in arms. Of this the Ameri|can general having made a complaint, it was replied, "that by the laws of America, every inhabitant from &s;ixteen to &s;ixty was liable to be called on to take up arms, and was therefore to be con&s;idered at all times, and treated as a &s;oldier. It could be no inju&s;tice there|fore to carry off, and detain as pri&s;oners of war, as ma|ny of them as could be taken, whether armed or not, to be exchanged for &s;oldiers or &s;ailors."</P>

The de&s;ign of evacuating Philadelphia was put in execution on the 18th of June, at 3 o'clock in the morning, Mr. Eden, one of the commi&s;&s;ioners, having brought with him &s;ecret in&s;tructions from England for that purpo&s;e. The troops proceeded to Glouce&s;ter Point, three miles down the river, and before ten the whole had pa&s;&s;ed in &s;afety acro&s;s the Delaware into New Jer&s;ey.</P>
<P>General Wa&s;hington having penetrated into their de|&s;ign of evacuating Philadelphia, had previou&s;ly detached general Maxwell's brigade, to co-operate with the Jer|&s;ey militia, in ob&s;tructing their progre&s;s, until he could overtake them with his army. This detachment was afterwards &s;trengthened by a body of 600 men under colonel Morgan; but being unable to cope with the Briti&s;h force, could do nothing but break down the bridg|es, after abandoning a &s;trong po&s;t they had occupied, with a view to di&s;pute the pa&s;&s;age of the enemy. The troops therefore, pur&s;ued their march for &s;ome time without any interruption from the Americans, though greatly encumbered with a va&s;t quantity of baggage, the number of loaded hor&s;es and wheel carriages being &s;o great as to occupy a line of twelve miles in length, though in this were included the provi&s;ions nece&s;&s;ary for their whole retreat, and which could not have been procured in a country &s;o extremely inimical to the Briti&s;h cau&s;e. The march was exceedingly retarded by the heat of the weather, which at that time was exce&s;&s;ive, the clo&s;ene&s;s of the narrow roads through the woods, and the con&s;tant labour of renewing or re|pairing bridges, in a country every where inter&s;ected with creeks and mar&s;hy brooks.</P>
<P>The &s;low advance of &s;ir Henry Clinton led general Wa&s;hington to &s;u&s;pect, that he had a de&s;ign of bringing on a general action, if he could draw the Americans into the low country. Having halted within five miles
<PB N="220" REF="028963_0284_0FDE9E540AC21EB0">of Princeton, he repre&s;ented to the general officers that the enemy's force was between 9 and 10,000 rank and file&mdash;the American army on the ground 10,684 rank and file,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>June</HI> 24.</NOTE> be&s;ides the advanced brigade under general Maxwell of about 1200, and about 1200 militia, and propo&s;ed, "Will it be advi&s;eable to hazard a general action?" They an&s;wered in the negative, but recommended a detach|ment of 1500 men, to be immediately &s;ent, to act as occa&s;ion might &s;erve, in conjunction with the troops and militia already hanging about the left flank and rear of the enemy.</P>
<P>After various movements on both &s;ides, &s;ir Henry Clinton, with the royal army, arrived at a place called Freehold; where judging that the Ameri|cans would attack him,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>June</HI> 27.</NOTE> he encamped in a very &s;trong &s;ituation. Here general Wa&s;h|ington determined to make an attack as &s;oon as the army had begun its march. The night was &s;pent in making the nece&s;&s;ary preparations, and Lee, who hav|ing been lately exchanged had joined the army, was ordered to have his divi&s;ion ready by daybreak. But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ir Henry Clinton, apprehending that the chief object of the Americans was the baggage, committed it to the care of general Knyphau&s;en, whom he ordered to &s;et out early in the morning, whil&s;t he followed with the re&s;t of the army &s;ome hours after, in the road towards Middletown, a place di&s;tant about twelve miles, in a high and &s;trong country. The attack was accordingly made; but the Briti&s;h general had taken &s;uch care to arrange his troops properly,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>June</HI> 28.</NOTE> and &s;o effectually &s;upported his forces when engaged with the Americans, that general Lee, although his troops behaved with great &s;pirit, thought proper to retreat; and they were with difficulty pre&s;erved from a total defeat by the advance of general Wa&s;hington
<PB N="221" REF="028963_0284_0FDE9E540AC21EB0">with the whole army; who intended to have renewed the engagement the next day; but the Briti&s;h troops marched away in the night, without the lo&s;s of either their covering party or baggage; and with &s;uch &s;ilence, that general Poor, who lay very near them, knew noth|ing of their departure until it was too late to urge a pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>From the di&s;cordant accounts of this battle, it is dif|ficult to collect the real truth. By the con&s;equences it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e that very little was gained on ei|ther &s;ide. Both parties, however, &s;eem to have exerted them&s;elves to the utmo&s;t, as by the Briti&s;h accounts it appears that fifty-nine of their &s;oldiers died of mere fatigue, without any wound; and the like happened to &s;everal American &s;oldiers, notwith&s;tanding their be|ing &s;o much accu&s;tomed to the climate. The lo&s;s of the Americans in killed and wounded, was about 250; that of the royal army, inclu&s;ive of pri&s;oners, was about 350. Among the latter were four officers and about forty privates, all &s;o badly wounded, that they could not be removed. Their other wounded they carried off. Lieutenant colonel Monckton, one of the Briti&s;h &s;lain, on account of his &s;ingular merit, was univer&s;ally lamented. Colonel Bonner of Penn&s;ylvania, and major Dicken&s;on of Virginia, officers highly e&s;teemed by their country, fell in this action.</P>
<P>In this action general Lee was charged by general Wa&s;hington with di&s;obedience and mi&s;conduct in re|treating before the Briti&s;h army. He was tried by a court martial, and &s;entenced to be &s;u&s;pended from his com|mand in the American army for a twelvemonth. Ma|ny were di&s;plea&s;ed with this &s;entence, becau&s;e it had been &s;ubmitted to his di&s;cretion whether to attack or not, and likewi&s;e when and in what manner: and they thought that &s;u&s;pen&s;ion from command, was not a &s;ufficient puni&s;hment for his crimes, if guilty. They
<PB N="222" REF="028963_0285_0FDE9E559A6DE268">therefore inferred his innocence from the lenient &s;en|tence of his judges.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h army pur&s;ued their march without any interruption to the neighbourhood of Sandy Hook, and on the 5th of July cro&s;&s;ed the narrow channel to Sandy Hook on a bridge of boats, and were afterwards &s;afely conveyed to New York. During the march from Phil|adelphia, the royal army was much reduced, upwards of 800 having de&s;erted, a great number of whom were He&s;&s;ians.</P>
<P>Soon after the battle of Freehold, or Monmouth, at it is &s;ometimes called, the American army took po&s;t at the White Plains, a few miles beyond King's Bridge; and the Briti&s;h, though only a few miles di&s;tant, did not mole&s;t them. They remained in this po&s;ition from an early day in July till a late one in the autumn, and then the Americans retired to Middle Brook in Jer&s;ey, where they remained in huts, as they had done at Valley Forge.</P>
<P>In the mean time the French fleet from Toulon had arrived at Virginia. On the 7th of July, lord Howe received advice of its arrival. Count D'E&s;taing an|chored on the 8th at night at the entrance of the Del|aware. The next morning he weighed and &s;ailed towards the Hook, and on the evening of the 11th an|chored about four miles without it. Had not bad weather and unexpected impediments prevented, the count would have &s;urpri&s;ed Howe's fleet in the Dela|ware, as the latter would not have had time to e&s;cape after being appri&s;ed of his danger. The de&s;truction of the fleet mu&s;t have been the con&s;equence of &s;uch a &s;urpri&s;al, and that mu&s;t have occa&s;ioned the inevitable lo&s;s of the royal army, which would have been &s;o en|clo&s;ed by the French &s;quadron on the one &s;ide, and the American forces on the other, that the Saratoga cata&s;trophe mu&s;t have been repeated. Lord Howe's
<PB N="223" REF="028963_0285_0FDE9E559A6DE268">fleet con&s;i&s;ted only of 6 &s;ixty-four gun &s;hips, 3 of fifty, and 2 of forty, with &s;ome frigates and &s;loops; whereas count D'E&s;taing's con&s;i&s;ted of 12 &s;ail of the line and &s;everal large frigates. Among the former, one carried 90 guns, another 80, and &s;ix 74 guns each. The French fleet had, exclu&s;ive of its complement of &s;ailors, 6000 marines and &s;oldiers on board.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h admiral had the advantage of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the harbour formed by Sandy Hook; the entrance of which is covered by a bay, and from whence the inlet pa&s;&s;es to New York. As it could not be known wheth|er the French would not attempt pa&s;&s;ing in force over the bar, it was nece&s;&s;ary the Briti&s;h &s;hould be prepared to oppo&s;e them. Accordingly, the commanders made every di&s;po&s;ition that con&s;ummate military &s;kill could &s;ugge&s;t, for with&s;tanding the formidable power which threatened to a&s;&s;ail them. On this occa&s;ion a &s;pirit di&s;played it&s;elf not only in the fleet and army, but through every order and denomination of &s;eamen, that is not often equalled. Tran&s;ported with indignation again&s;t the French for interfering in what they called a dome&s;tic quarrel, the Briti&s;h di&s;played a zeal and magnanimity which could not be exceeded. The crews of the tran&s;ports ha&s;tened with eagerne&s;s to the &s;leet, that it might be completely manned. The ma&s;|ters and mates of the merchantmen at New York, took their &s;tations at the guns with the common &s;ailors: others put to &s;ea in light ve&s;&s;els, to watch the motions of their enemies. The light infantry, grenadiers, and even wounded officers contended &s;o earne&s;tly to &s;erve as marines on board the men of war, that the point of honour was obliged to be decided by lot.</P>
<P>During this time the Briti&s;h had the mortification of &s;eeing the blockade of their fleet, and the capture of about twenty ve&s;&s;els under Briti&s;h colours. On the 22d, the French fleet appeared under weigh. The
<PB N="224" REF="028963_0286_0FDE9E5720501840">Briti&s;h, in this anxious moment, &s;uppo&s;ed that count D'E&s;taing would force his way into the harbour; when nothing le&s;s than de&s;truction or victory would have ended the conte&s;t. Had the fir&s;t been their lot, the va&s;t fleet of tran&s;ports and the army mu&s;t have fallen.
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>July</HI> 22.</NOTE> D'E&s;taing, however, left the Hook and &s;ailed for Newport. He was led to this mea&s;ure by the advice of general Wa&s;hington; the pilots likewi&s;e a&s;&s;ured him that it was impo&s;&s;ible to carry the large &s;hips over the bar, on account of their draught of water.</P>
<P>By D'E&s;taing's departure the Briti&s;h had a &s;econd e&s;cape. Had he &s;taid a few days longer, admiral By|ron's fleet would have fallen a defencele&s;s prey into his hands. That &s;quadron had met with unu&s;ual bad weather, and being &s;eparated in different &s;torms, and lingering through a tedious pa&s;&s;age, arrived &s;cattered, broken, &s;ickly, di&s;ma&s;ted, or otherwi&s;e damaged, in va|rious degrees of di&s;tre&s;s, upon different and remote parts of the American coa&s;t. Between the departure of D'E&s;taing and the 30th of July, the Renown of 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> guns from the We&s;t Indies, the Rai&s;onable and Cen|turion of 64 and the Cornwall of 74 guns, all arrived &s;ingly at Sandy Hook. A number of provi&s;ion &s;hips from Cork e&s;caped al&s;o, together with their convoy. They went up the Delaware within fifty miles of Phil|adelphia after lord Howe had quitted the river, before they obtained information of what had happened. Great rejoicings were made at New York, upon their &s;afe arrival, e&s;pecially as provi&s;ions were much wanted both by the fleet and army.</P>
<P>The next attempt of the French admiral was, in conjunction with the Americans upon Rhode I&s;land, which had been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Briti&s;h &s;ince De|cember 1776. For this purpo&s;e, general Sullivan a&s;|&s;embled a body of troops in the vicinity of Providence,
<PB N="225" REF="028963_0286_0FDE9E5720501840">with a view to invade the i&s;land from the continent, whil&s;t the French fleet was to enter the harbour of Newport, near its &s;outhern extremity, and after de&s;troy|ing the &s;hipping by a powerful a&s;&s;ault on the works fac|ing the &s;ea, to place the Briti&s;h troops between two fires. The commanding officer, general Pigot, having been lately reinforced, had about 6000 troops, and had taken every precaution which the military art could furni&s;h, in order to obviate the very great danger in which he was. General Sullivan, however, having collected about 10,000 men, of whom one half at lea&s;t were volunteers from New England and Con|necticut,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 8.</NOTE> pa&s;&s;ed over into the i&s;land on the 8th of Augu&s;t, when the French fleet al&s;o entered the harbour, cannonading the batteries as they pa&s;&s;ed along, and receiving their fire without any ma|terial effect on either &s;ide. Their entrance, however, obliged the Briti&s;h commanders to burn three frigates, and &s;ink two others.</P>
<P>Lord Howe no &s;ooner received advice of the danger which threatened Rhode I&s;land, than he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ened to its relief. The Briti&s;h fleet exceeded the French in point of number, but was inferior in point of effective force and weight of metal. The re&s;ult of lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Howe's com|munication with general Pigot was, that in the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, he could afford no e&s;&s;ential <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d. The bad conduct of D'E&s;taing, however, &s;oon altered the face of affairs. The wind no &s;ooner &s;hifted, than, as if he had forgot that his de&s;ign was, to reduce <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he Briti&s;h forces in Rhode I&s;land, not to &s;ight their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, he abandoned the harbour, and &s;ailed out to attack them. The engagement was prevented by a violent tempe&s;t, in which both fleets &s;uffered extremely, but the French much more than the Briti&s;h; the con&s;equence of which was, that D'E&s;taing, having returned to Newport on the 20th of Augu&s;t, was induced, by the advice of his
<PB N="226" REF="028963_0287_0FDE9E58A524C618">officers, the &s;econd day after, to &s;et &s;ail for Bo&s;ton to refit his &s;hips, leaving general Sullivan to carry on the enterprize again&s;t Rhode I&s;land as he thought proper.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by the French fleet was &s;o con&s;id|erable, that &s;ome of their capital &s;hips were in the ut|mo&s;t danger of being taken. D'E&s;taing's own &s;hip, the Languedoc, of 90 guns, having lo&s;t all her ma&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was met in that condition by the Renown of 50 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> captain Daw&s;on, who engaged her with &s;uch fury, that nothing but the approach of night prevented the ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ral from becoming a prize; nor could &s;he po&s;&s;ibly have e&s;caped next morning, had not &s;ix French men of w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> come up and forced the Briti&s;h captain to move off.&mdash; The Tonnant of 80 guns, with only her mainma&s;t &s;tanding, was attacked the &s;ame evening by the Pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> of 50 guns, and e&s;caped in the very &s;ame way. The mo&s;t remarkable action, however, was between the I&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of 50, captain Raynor, and the Cae&s;ar of 74 guns; both of which had entirely e&s;caped the effects of the tem|pe&s;t. Between the&s;e two a de&s;perate and clo&s;e engage|ment, within pi&s;tol &s;hot, was maintained for an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and a half; at the end of which time, the I&s;is had ob|tained &s;uch a manife&s;t &s;uperiority that the Frenchman was glad to put before the wind, in order to e&s;cape from &s;o furious an adver&s;ary. The I&s;is, however, had &s;uffered &s;o much in her &s;ails and rigging, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> capable of pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>In the mean time the extreme bad weather had pre|vented general Sullivan for &s;ome days from bringing for|ward his artillery and &s;tores; but on the 17th of Au|gu&s;t, he began his operations by erecting batteries, and making approaches to the Briti&s;h lines. But general Pigot had taken &s;uch mea&s;ures, that without the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of a marine force it was altogether impo&s;&s;ible to attack him with any probability of &s;ucce&s;s. The con|duct of D'E&s;taing, therefore, who had abandoned them
<PB N="227" REF="028963_0287_0FDE9E58A524C618">when ma&s;ter of the harbour, gave the greate&s;t di&s;gu&s;t to the people of New England, and Sullivan began to think of a retreat, on the Briti&s;h fleet being &s;een off the coa&s;t. The garri&s;on, on perceiving his intentions, fallied out upon him with &s;o much vigour, that it was not without difficulty that he could effect his retreat;
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 30.</NOTE> which, however, he did in &s;uch excellent order, that although he was re|peatedly attacked by the Briti&s;h forces, wherever an op|portunity occurred, he met with very incon&s;iderable lo&s;s, nor did he leave a &s;ingle article behind. Nor was his good fortune inferior to his conduct; as &s;ir Henry Clinton arrived at Rhode I&s;land immediately after his departure, with &s;uch a force as mu&s;t have decided the fate of the American army, had they been there at that time.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day that Sullivan abandoned Rhode I&s;land lord Howe entered the bay of Bo&s;ton, where, to his great mortification, he found D'E&s;taing already arrived, and &s;o effectually protected by batteries in Nanta&s;ket road, that it was utterly impo&s;&s;ible to attack him with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s; on which he proceeded for Rhode I&s;land; but finding that place already out of danger, he returned to New York, where he re&s;igned the command of the fleet to admiral Gambier, and re|turned to England.</P>
<P>Sir Henry Clinton now returned to New York,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sept.</HI> 5.</NOTE> but directed general Grey to proceed to Bedford and the neighbourhood, where &s;everal American privateers re&s;orted. On the 5th of September, the party landed, and in a few hours de|&s;troyed 70 &s;ail of &s;hipping, be&s;ides a number of &s;mall craft. They al&s;o burned wharves, &s;tores, ve&s;&s;els on the &s;tocks, and a con&s;iderable number of dwelling hou&s;|es. The royal troops proceeded to Martha's Vineyard. There they de&s;troyed a few ve&s;&s;els, and made a requi|&s;ition
<PB N="228" REF="028963_0288_0FDE9E688FB7B650">of the militia arms, the public money, 300 oxen and 2000 &s;heep, which was complied with.</P>
<P>Another expedition took place up the North River, under lord Cornwallis and general Knyphau&s;en, the principal event of which was the de&s;truction of a reg|iment of American cavalry, commanded by lieutenant colonel Baylor, whil&s;t watching to intercept a Briti&s;h foraging party. The officer, who commanded the par|ty which &s;urpri&s;ed them, was major general Grey. He had acquired the name of the "No flint general," from his common practice of taking out the flints, and con|fining the men to the u&s;e of the bayonet. Grey's men proceeded with &s;uch &s;ilence and addre&s;s, that they out off a &s;erjeant's patrol without noi&s;e, and &s;urrounded the barn near Tapan, in which the dragoons were a&s;leep. A mo&s;t &s;hocking &s;cene en&s;ued. Many were put <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> death, or repeatedly wounded, whil&s;t a&s;king for quar|ter. A few e&s;caped, and others who were wounded, were re&s;tored in a cour&s;e of time, to perfect health. Baylor him&s;elf was wounded, but not dangerou&s;ly. He lo&s;t in killed, wounded and taken 67 privates out of 104. About 40 were made pri&s;oners. The&s;e were indebted for their lives, it is &s;aid, to the humanity of one of Grey's captains, who gave quarters to the whole fourth troop, though contrary to the orders of his &s;u|perior officers.</P>
<P>A third expedition was directed to Little Egg Har|bour, in New Jer&s;ey, a place noted for priva|teers,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Oct.</HI> 5.</NOTE> the de&s;truction of which was its prin|cipal intention. It was conducted by captains Fergu&s;on and Collins, and ended in the de&s;truction of the privateers and other ve&s;&s;els, as well as the place it|&s;elf. Soon after this, another body of American troops, called Pula&s;ki's legion, were &s;urpri&s;ed, and 50 of them put to the &s;word;
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Oct.</HI> 15.</NOTE> among them were baron de Bo&s;e and lieutenant de la Borderis.
<PB N="229" REF="028963_0288_0FDE9E688FB7B650">The attack being in the night, little quarter could be given; more would probably have been granted, had not a French captain and &s;ome privates, who had de|&s;erted from count Pula&s;ki, fal&s;ely reported that he had i&s;&s;ued public orders to grant no quarter to Briti&s;h troops. The &s;laughter would not have ended &s;o &s;oon, had not Pula&s;ki ha&s;tened with his cavalry to &s;upport the infantry; and the Briti&s;h, being only 250 in num|ber, made a ha&s;ty retreat, and returned to their boats.</P>
<P>But however reprehen&s;ible the conduct of the Brit|i&s;h and He&s;&s;ians might have been in the mode of treat|ing their opponents, as abovementioned, their &s;everities were far exceeded by tho&s;e of their allies, the Indians and American refugees. As leaders in the&s;e &s;cenes of de&s;truction, the names of colonel Butler and Brandt mu&s;t &s;tand con&s;igned to perpetual infamy. The form|er, a Connecticut tory, had been an Indian agent in the wars in Canada; and had great influence with &s;ome of the northern Indians; the other was an half Indian by blood, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the ferocity, cruelty, and de&s;perate courage, which are often found united in the &s;avage &s;tate. It is ea&s;y to conceive how mi&s;erable the &s;ituation of tho&s;e unhappy captives mu&s;t have been, who fell into their hands, where no &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion could procure mercy, nor any condition, age or &s;ex, allay their fury.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of their ravages, the ruin of the fine &s;ettlement of Wyoming was particularly affecting. That di&s;trict, &s;ituated on the ea&s;tern branch of the Su&s;|quehannah, though naturally &s;eeming to belong to Penn&s;ylvania, had been peopled by a numerous colony from Connecticut. This, however, was &s;o much re|&s;ented by the Penn&s;ylvanians, that, after much alterca|tion, it became the cau&s;e of actual war between the two colonies, which was not terminated until the con|te&s;t with the mother country obliged both parties to &s;u&s;pend their ho&s;tilities. The di&s;trict con&s;i&s;ted of eight
<PB N="230" REF="028963_0289_0FDE9E6A1807AC20">town&s;hips, each containing a &s;quare of five miles, beau|tifully &s;ituated on both &s;ides of the river. The climate was mild, and the &s;oil luxuriou&s;ly fertile; every per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an abundance, the fruit of moderate labour and indu&s;try. So that upon the whole, this &s;ettlement exhibited &s;uch a picture of primeval happine&s;s, as can &s;carcely be &s;uppo&s;ed to be exceeded, indeed very &s;eldom equalled, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of humanity.</P>
<P>In the&s;e happy circum&s;tances, the population of Wy|oming had become &s;o great, that it had already <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> 1000 men to &s;erve in the continental army; and the &s;upplies which it &s;ent in grain and cattle bore an equal proportion to that which it afforded in men. Nor had the people been deficient in providing again&s;t tho&s;e dangers to which their remote &s;ituation particularly ex|po&s;ed them; they had con&s;tructed for that purpo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> four forts, which &s;eemed at lea&s;t &s;ufficient to cover the country from the incur&s;ions of the &s;avages. In this remote &s;ettlement, where government was feeble, the tories were under le&s;s control, and could ea&s;ily a&s;&s;emble undi&s;covered. However, at one time, 27 of them were taken and &s;ent to Hartford in Connecticut, but they were afterwards relea&s;ed. The&s;e and others of the &s;ame de&s;cription, in&s;tigated by revenge again&s;t the Americans, from whom &s;ome of them had &s;uffered bani&s;hment and lo&s;s of property, made a common cau&s;e with the Indians, and in the beginning of July 1778, attacked the Wyoming &s;ettlement with their combined forces, e&s;timated at 1100 men, 900 of which were Indians. One of the &s;maller forts, mo&s;tly garri|&s;oned by tho&s;e called tories, was by them given up, or, as it was &s;aid, betrayed; another was taken by &s;torm, where although they ma&s;&s;acred the men in the mo&s;t inhuman manner, they &s;pared the women and children.</P>
<P>Colonel Zebulon Butler, a near relation to the invader,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>July</HI> 3.</NOTE> leaving a &s;mall number to guard Wilke&s;burgh, cro&s;&s;ed the river with about
<PB N="231" REF="028963_0289_0FDE9E6A1807AC20">400 men, and marched into King&s;ton fort, whither the women, children and defencele&s;s of all forts crowded for protection. He &s;uffered him&s;elf to be enticed by his kin&s;man to abandon the &s;ecurity afforded by this fortre&s;s. Under colour of holding a parley for the conclu&s;ion of a treaty, he was led into an agreement to march out to hold a conference in the open field, on the enemy withdrawing their force. Yet &s;uch was his di&s;tru&s;t of the enemy's de&s;igns, that he marched out with 400 men, being nearly his whole force. On his arrival he found no body to treat with, and yet advan|ced to the foot of the mountain, where, at a di&s;tance, he &s;aw a flag, the holders of which, &s;eemingly afraid of treachery on his &s;ide, retired as he advanced, whil&s;t he, endeavouring to remove this pretended ill impre&s;|&s;ion, pur&s;ued the flag, till his party was entirely enclo&s;|ed, when he was &s;uddenly freed from his delu&s;ion, by finding it attacked at once on every &s;ide. His beha|viour in this dangerous &s;ituation, was &s;uch as could &s;carcely have been expected from his former conduct: he and his party fought with re&s;olution and bravery, keeping up a continual and heavy fire for three quar|ters of an hour, and &s;eemed to be gaining ground on his numerous enemies. In this critical moment, &s;ome &s;udden impul&s;e of fear, or premeditated treachery in a &s;oldier, which induced him to cry out that "the colo|nel had ordered a retreat," determined at once the fate of the party. Univer&s;al confu&s;ion en&s;ued, and no quar|ter was given. Colonel Zebulon Butler, and about 70 of his men e&s;caped; the latter got acro&s;s the river to Wilke&s;borough, the colonel made his way to Fort King|&s;ton, which was inve&s;ted the next day on the land &s;ide.

<PB N="232" REF="028963_0290_0FDE9E6BA711CCF0">fire upon the garri&s;on the whole day. In the evening the colonel quitted the fort and went down the river with his family. He was thought to be the only officer who e&s;caped.</P>
<P>Colonel Denni&s;on, who &s;ucceeded to the command of the fort,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>July</HI> 5.</NOTE> &s;eeing the impo&s;&s;ibility of any effectual re&s;i&s;tance, not having force &s;ufficient to man the works for even one effort, went with a flag to Butler to know what terms he would grant upon a &s;urrender. To this application of weak|ne&s;s and mi&s;ery, Butler, with all the phlegm of a real &s;avage, an&s;wered, in two &s;hort words, "The hatchet." In the&s;e dreadful circum&s;tances, the unfortunate gover|nour having defended his fort until the mo&s;t of the garri&s;on were killed or di&s;abled, was at length com|pelled to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion. Some of the unhap|py per&s;ons were carried away alive; but the barbaro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> conquero<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, to &s;ave the trouble of murder in detail, &s;hut up the re&s;t promi&s;cuou&s;ly in the hou&s;es and barracks, which, having then &s;et on fire, they enjoyed the &s;avage plea&s;ure of beholding the whole con&s;umed in one gen|eral blaze. They then proceeded to the only remain|ing fort, called Wilke&s;burgh, which, in hopes of obtain|ing mercy, &s;urrendered without re&s;i&s;tance, or without even demanding any conditions. Here the traged<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was renewed with aggravated horrors. They found about 70 continental &s;oldiers, who had been engaged merely for the defence of the frontiers. With the&s;e, as objects of particular enmity, the &s;laughter was be|gun, and they were butchered with every circum&s;tance of the mo&s;t deliberate, wanton and &s;avage cruelty. A captain Bedlow, who had been taken pri&s;oner, being &s;tripped naked, had his body &s;tuck full of &s;harp pine &s;plinters, and then a heap of knots of the &s;ame wood being piled around him, the whole was &s;et on fire; and his two companions, the captains Ran&s;on and Durgee,
<PB N="233" REF="028963_0290_0FDE9E6BA711CCF0">thrown alive into the flames. The remainder of the men, with the women and children, not demanding &s;o much attention, were &s;hut up as before, in the hou&s;es, which being &s;et on fire, they peri&s;hed altogether in the flames.</P>
<P>A general &s;cene of deva&s;tation was now &s;pread through all the town&s;hips. Fire and &s;word alternately triumph|ed. Nay, the mercile&s;s ravagers, when the main ob|jects of their cruelty were exhau&s;ted, &s;eemed to direct their animo&s;ity again&s;t every part of animated nature; and, as if it were a relaxation or amu&s;ement, cut out the tongues of the hor&s;es and cattle, leaving them &s;till alive only to prolong their agonies.</P>
<P>Though the Americans were fully re&s;olved to take ample vengeance for the barbarities committed at Wy|oming, their attention was &s;o much engaged by affairs of the utmo&s;t importance that they cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d not for &s;ome time undertake any thing of con&s;equence again&s;t tho&s;e who had been perpetrators of that horrid tragedy. A &s;mall expedition, however, was, during the cour&s;e of the &s;ummer, undertaken from Virginia, by colonel Clarke, with no more than 200 or 300 men. The ob|ject was to reduce tho&s;e French &s;ettlements which had been planted by the Canadians on the upper Mi&s;|&s;i&s;ippi, &s;ituated in a fine fertile country called the <HI>Illi|nois,</HI> from a nation of Indians of that name. Much of the mi&s;chief which had fallen upon the back &s;ettle|ments was attributed to the governour of tho&s;e colonies, who, it was &s;aid, had acted as an agent for the Briti&s;h, and be&s;ides his paying a large reward for &s;calps, had been indefatigable in his endeavours to excite the Ohio and Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi Indians to attack the defencele&s;s parts of the colonies. In pro&s;ecution of this de&s;ign, the troops were obliged to traver&s;e 1200 miles of a boundle&s;s un|cultivated de&s;ert, in which they endured inde&s;cribable hard&s;hips and fatigue, both by land and water; and
<PB N="234" REF="028963_0291_0FDE9E6D2B79BED8">on the two la&s;t days of their march to the principal town of the &s;ettlement named Ka&s;ka&s;kias, they were without any &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The town con&s;i&s;ted of about 250 hou&s;es, and was fortified in &s;uch a manner as would have &s;ufficed to with&s;tand a much &s;tronger en|emy. The Americans were &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with hunger and fatigue that they were determined to &s;ucceed or peri&s;h in the attempt. They arrived at the town about midnight; and &s;o complete was the &s;urpri&s;e, that the town and &s;ort were taken without oppo&s;ition, before the people were well awake; and the inhabitants were &s;o effectually &s;ecured, that not a &s;ingle per&s;on e&s;caped to alarm the neighbouring &s;ettlements. The governour, Philip Rocheblave, was con&s;idered as &s;uch an inveter|ate enemy to the United States, that he was &s;ent to Virginia with all the written in&s;tructions he had re|ceived from Detroit, Quebeck, and Michillimackinack, for in&s;tigating and paying the Indians. The inhabit|ants were obliged to take an oath of allegiance to the United States; and the conquerors took up their head quarters at Ka&s;ka&s;kias. The &s;maller towns were &s;ub|dued without difficulty; and the inhabitants, without compul&s;ion, flocked in by hundreds, to take the oath to their new ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e called tories, who had been the immediate actors in the ma&s;&s;acre at Wyoming, now became the object of vengeance. In October 1778, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> expedition was undertaken again&s;t them from the remote and upper parts of Penn&s;ylvania,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Oct.</HI> 1.</NOTE> under the conduct of colonel Butler, of the Penn&s;ylva|nia troops. The enemy inhabited the country about the upper parts of the Su&s;quehannah, and were &s;o in|termixed with the Indians, as to be in a manner united to them. The difficulties which colonel Butler's men encountered in this expedition, could not be undergone but by men po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a great &s;hare of hardine&s;s both
<PB N="235" REF="028963_0291_0FDE9E6D2B79BED8">of body and mind. They were obliged to carry their provi&s;ions on their backs, and thus loaded, frequently to wade through creeks and rivers. They, however, accompli&s;hed the de&s;truction of the Tory and Indian villages on both &s;ides of the Su&s;quehannah; but the inhabitants e&s;caped. The fruits of a plentiful harve&s;t, together with the only &s;aw mill and gri&s;t mill in that whole country, &s;hared the fate of the hou&s;es, and every other article u&s;eful or nece&s;&s;ary to man. This de|&s;tructive expedition was completed in &s;ixteen days.
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nov.</HI> 4.</NOTE> About four weeks after colonel But|ler's return, &s;ome hundreds of Indians, a large body of tories, and about fifty regulars, entered Cherry Valley, within the &s;tate of New York.

<P>An expedition was de&s;igned again&s;t the Virginia back &s;ettlers by Henry Hamilton, lieutenant governour of Detroit, but, by the &s;pirited exertions of colonel Clarke, his plan was entirely deranged. Clarke, on hearing the weak &s;ituation in which Hamilton was at St. Vincents, attacked him in the beginning of the year 1779; and having taken the town, the inhabitants a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in taking the fort.

<P>Colonel G. Van Schaick, with 55 men, marched from Fort Schuyler to the Onon|dago &s;ettlements,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>April</HI> 19.</NOTE> and burned and de&s;troyed their hou&s;es and provi&s;ions. Hor&s;es, and &s;tock of ev|ery
<PB N="236" REF="028963_0292_0FDE9E7A0C5BC1E0">kind were killed. Twelve Indians were killed, and thirty-four made pri&s;oners; and their arms and ammunition were either de&s;troyed or carried off.</P>
<P>The account of the war with the Indians being but little connected with the military tran&s;actions to be hereafter de&s;cribed, we &s;hall in this place fini&s;h the re|view of the &s;avage &s;cenes.</P>
<P>The expeditions again&s;t the Indians already related, were, however, but a &s;mall part of the cha&s;ti&s;ement to which the&s;e barbarians were de&s;tined. The languid manner in which the campaign at that time happened to be carried on at New York, afforded lei&s;ure to con|gre&s;s to pour forth upon them that exemplary vengeance which they had threatened. The objects of this ven|geance were the Six Nations, commonly called the Mohawks, who&s;e confederacy &s;eems to form in the&s;e de&s;erts the wide outlines of a republic. The&s;e nations inhabit that immen&s;e and fertile tract of country which lies between New England, the middle &s;tates and the province of Canada; and had long been renowned for the courage, con&s;tancy and fidelity, with which they had adhered to the Engli&s;h in their wars with the French; and had even a&s;&s;i&s;ted them frequently again&s;t different nations of their own countrymen. They had been advi&s;ed by congre&s;s, and they had promi&s;ed to ob&s;erve a neutrality in the war, but they &s;oon departed from this line of conduct. The Oneidas and a few others were friends to the Americans, but a great ma|jority took part decidedly again&s;t them. Overcome by the pre&s;ents of &s;ir John John&s;on and other Briti&s;h agents, and their own native appetite for depredation, they invaded the frontiers, carrying &s;laughter and de&s;|clation wherever they went.</P>
<P>It was therefore thought expedient to di&s;patch gen|eral Sullivan on this expedition. The army, when joined on the 21&s;t of Augu&s;t by general James Clinton,
<PB N="237" REF="028963_0292_0FDE9E7A0C5BC1E0">amounted to 5000 men, including batteaux men, wag|goners, &amp;c. The train of artillery con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ix light field pieces and two howitzers; and, to quicken the celerity of the march, the army was furni&s;hed with 1400 hor&s;es. All the&s;e preparations were made again&s;t 550 Indians, accompanied by about 250 tories, mak|ing no more than 800 in all, headed by Butler, Brandt, Guy John&s;on and Macdonald.</P>
<P>The Indians marched boldly towards their frontiers to meet the invaders. They po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of a difficult pa&s;s in the woods, between Chemung and Newtown, in the neighbourhood of Teago River, where they con&s;tructed a &s;trong brea&s;twork, of about half a mile in extent, made of large logs; from whence other works of le&s;s-&s;trength reachee for a mile and a half to the top of a mountain in their rear, where a &s;econd brea&s;twork was formed. Here a fierce attack commenced on the 29th of Augu&s;t 1779, which con|tinued for two hours. The Indians re&s;i&s;ted with un|common bravery; nor could the brea&s;twork have been forced without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the artillery, which the provincial army had carried along with them. The Indians, however, on perceiving that &s;ome di&s;po&s;itions were made for turning their flank, and thereby cutting off their retreat, no per&s;ua&s;ions could prevail on them to &s;tand their ground any longer. They fled with the utmo&s;t precipitation; and &s;o complete was the victory obtained by general Sullivan on this occa&s;ion, that the enemy never dared to make another &s;tand to interrupt the de&s;olation of their country.</P>
<P>The next and greate&s;t difficulty which the invaders met with was want of provi&s;ions. Several cau&s;es pre|vented them from procuring above half the quantity nece&s;&s;ary for the expedition, which it was not expected could be fini&s;hed in le&s;s than a month. But the violent de&s;ire of being revenged on the barbarians
<PB N="238" REF="028963_0293_0FDE9E7B925F3B58">again&s;t whom they were &s;ent, with the animating &s;peeches of their commander, removed all impedi|ments: the propo&s;al of &s;hort allowance was received with the loude&s;t &s;houts of approbation; and the ration for twenty-four hours was fixed at half a pound of flour, and as much beef per day; the reduction ex|tending even to &s;alt.</P>
<P>In attempting to proceed into the Indian country, Sullivan found to his &s;urpri&s;e that no guides could be found to direct him; and the only method he had of finding his way to their towns, was that which direct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the hunter to the den of a wild bea&s;t, namely, the trac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the inhabitant. It was even more difficult in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, as the la&s;t of a file of Indians always cov|ers with leaves the tracks made by his fellows and him|&s;elf; &s;o that it requires much experience, as well a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> patience and indu&s;try to be able to develope and tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> them.</P>
<P>All the&s;e difficulties were, however, overcome; the towns were found out, and &s;uch a &s;cene of de&s;olation begun as mu&s;t be read with horrour, and which noth|ing, not even the implacable nature of their enemies, could ju&s;tify. Forty of their towns, the large&s;t con|taining 128 hou&s;es, were de&s;troyed; their corn, com|puted at no le&s;s than 160,000 bu&s;hels, &s;hared the &s;ame fate; their fruit trees were cut down, and them&s;elves pur&s;ued and &s;laughtered, till there was not, as far as the conquering army could perceive, a &s;ingle hou&s;e, field of corn, or inhabitant remaining in the whole country. Several officers, however, particularly gen|eral Hand and colonel Durbin, wi&s;hed the general to &s;pare the fruit trees; but he, when reque&s;ted to retract his orders, continued relentle&s;s, and &s;aid, "The In|dians &s;hall &s;ee that there is malice enough in our hearts to de&s;troy every thing that contributes towards their &s;upport." Some of the&s;e officers, already mentioned,
<PB N="239" REF="028963_0293_0FDE9E7B925F3B58">when &s;ent out, would not &s;ee any apple or peach trees, &s;o that a few were left to blo&s;&s;om and bear for the re|fre&s;hment of friend or foe that might chance to pa&s;s that way. In this expedition it was remarked, that the Indians had attained to a much higher degree of knowledge of the u&s;eful arts, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">an what had ever been imagined by any per&s;on. The fize, con&s;truction and neatne&s;s of their hou&s;es, were objects of admiration to the American army. In &s;ome places the hou&s;es were not only large, but elegant, and built of frame work. The &s;ize of corn, &s;ome ears of which were twenty-two inches in length, and the high degree of cultivation of their grounds, al&s;o excited wonder; and &s;o numerous were the fruit trees, that in one orchard, alone, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t down 1300, many of which were ob&s;erved to be of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> age. The whole of this de&s;tructive expedition was compri&s;ed in the &s;pace of a month, as no more time could po&s;&s;ibly be &s;pared. It is not known how many of the Americans were le&s;t; but the general brought back only 300 hor&s;es out of 1400 which he had taken with him. After this expedition, the fron|tiers, although not re&s;tored to perfect tranquility, were greatly freed from the calamities, in which they had been lately involved.</P>
<P>Before, and after, the termination of the above ex|pedition, &s;ome detached parties di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;everal &s;ettle|ments in the United States. A party of 60 Indians, and 27 white men, under Brandt, attacked the Mini&s;ink &s;ettlement, and burnt ten hou&s;es, twelve barns,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>July</HI> 23.</NOTE> a fort and two mills, and carried off much plunder, together with &s;everal pri&s;on|ers. The militia from Go&s;hen and the vicinity, to the amount of 149, pur&s;ued the invaders with &s;o little cau|tion, that they were them&s;elves &s;urpri&s;ed and defeated. About the &s;ame time, general William&s;on and colonel Pickens, both of South Carolina, burned and de&s;troyed
<PB N="240" REF="028963_0294_0FDE9E7D1E7F01C0">the corn of eight towns, adjacent to the frontiers of that &s;tate, and forced the Indians to remove into more remote &s;ettlements.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame month colonel Broadhead carried de&s;o|lation into the &s;ettlements of the Mingo, Mun&s;ey and Seneca Indians. He left Pitt&s;burgh with 605 men, and, having penetrated about 200 miles from the fort, de&s;troyed a number of Indian huts and about 500 acr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of corn.</P>
<P>In the months of Augu&s;t and October 1780, the frontiers of the &s;tate of New York &s;uffered con&s;iderably from Indians and their tory a&s;&s;o|ciates.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1780.</NOTE> The principal part of Canijohary, a fine &s;ettle|ment about 56 miles from Albany, was de&s;troyed. They burned 27 hou&s;es at Schoharie, and 20 at Nor|man's Creek. In another irruption they attacked Stone Arabia, Canafioraga and Schohavie. A great extent of country about the Mohawk River was likewi&s;e laid wa&s;te, numbers of the &s;ettlers killed, and many made pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>The Cherokee Indians &s;eeming to have for|got the con&s;equences of provoking the Ameri|cans to invade their &s;ettlements in 1776,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1781.</NOTE> made an in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur&s;ion into Ninety Six di&s;trict in South Carolina, ma&s;&s;acred &s;ome families, and burned &s;everal hou&s;es. General Pickens having collected 394 hor&s;emen, pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|etrated into their country, and, in the &s;pace of fourteen days, burned thirteen towns and villages, killed up|wards of 40 Indians, and took a number of pri&s;oner. The invaders, in this expedition, defeated a party of the enemy, with &s;uch deci&s;ion that only three Indians e&s;caped after having been once &s;een. A new and &s;uc|ce&s;sful mode of fighting them was introduced. The American militia, after firing three rounds, ru&s;hed for|wards on hor&s;eback, and charged the Indians with drawn &s;words. The vanqui&s;hed Cherokees &s;ued for
<PB N="241" REF="028963_0294_0FDE9E7D1E7F01C0">peace, on the mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive terms, and obtained it, upon promi&s;ing to deliver up &s;uch as &s;hould in&s;tigate them to make war upon the United States. General Pickens had the good fortune not to lo&s;e a &s;ingle man upon this occa&s;ion, and had only two wounded.</P>
<P>Towards the end of the war, in 1782, there was a barbarous and unprovoked ma&s;&s;acre of &s;ome civilized Indians,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1782.</NOTE> who had been &s;ettled near the Mu&s;kingum. The&s;e, under the influence of &s;ome pious mi&s;&s;ionaries of the Moravian per&s;ua&s;ion, had been formed into &s;ome degree of civil and relig|ious order. They abhorred war, and would take no part therein. They &s;aid that "The Great Being did not make men to de&s;troy men, but to love and a&s;&s;i&s;t each other." From a love of peace, they advi&s;ed tho&s;e of their own colour, who were bent on war, to de&s;i&s;t from it. They were al&s;o led by humanity, to inform the white people of their danger, when they knew that their &s;ettlements were about to be invaded. This pro|voked the ho&s;tile Indians to &s;uch a degree, that they c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ried the&s;e pacific people quite away from Mu&s;king|um to a bank of Sandu&s;ky creek. They, finding corn dear and &s;carce in their new habitations, obtained lib|erty to come back in the fall of the &s;ame year to Mu&s;|kingum, that they might collect the crops they had planted before their removal.</P>
<P>When the white people, at and near Monongahela, heard that a number of Indians were at the Moravian towns on the Mu&s;kingum, they gave out that their intentions were ho&s;tile. Without any farther inquiry, 160 of them cro&s;&s;ed the Ohio, and put to death the&s;e harmle&s;s, inoffen&s;ive people, though they made no re|&s;i&s;tance. In conformity to their religious principles, the&s;e Moravians patiently &s;ubmitted to their hard fate, without attempting to de&s;troy their murderers. Up|wards of 90 of this pacific &s;ect were killed by men,
<PB N="242" REF="028963_0295_0FDE9E7EA5D103D8">who; whil&s;t they called them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, were in|finitely more de&s;erving of the name of Savages th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> tho&s;e whom they inhumanly murdered.</P>
<P>Soon after this unprovoked ma&s;&s;acre, a party of the Americans &s;et out for Sandu&s;ky, to de&s;troy the Indian towns in that quarter; but the Delawares, Wyand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> and other Indians defeated them; &s;ome were killed, and &s;everal were taken pri&s;oners. Among the latter was colonel Crawford and his &s;on in law. The colo|nel was &s;acrificed to the manes of tho&s;e Indians who were ma&s;&s;acred at the Moravian towns; and the other pri&s;oners were tomahawked.</P>
<P>In this manner the &s;avage war was carried on in America. The de&s;olation, and cruelty inflicted by the Indians, and retorted by the Americans, were &s;ufficient to excite compa&s;&s;ion in the mo&s;t obdurate hearts.</P>
<P>TILL the autumn of 1778, the &s;eat of war betwixt the Briti&s;h and Americans had been chiefly confined to New York,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1778.</NOTE> the Jer&s;ies, Penn|&s;ylvania, and the borders of Connecticut; whil&s;t the &s;outhern colonies enjoyed a profound tranquillity, ex|cepting only &s;ome petty ho&s;tilities between the colonies of Georgia and Ea&s;t Florida. The Americans had in the beginning of the year projected the conque&s;t of We&s;t Florida. Captain Willing, with a party of re&s;o|lute men, had made a &s;ucce&s;sful incur&s;ion into the country called Natches, and greatly alarmed the whole colony of We&s;t Florida; and, although the people were totally in his power, granted them every condition which they required for their pre&s;ent and future &s;ecurity. His views, however, were thought at this time not to have been entirely confined to the reduction of the&s;e &s;ettlements, but to have extended to the opening of a corre&s;pondence with the Spaniards at New Orleans, as it was known that the court of Spain was about to make a declaration in favour of the Americans. This
<PB N="243" REF="028963_0295_0FDE9E7EA5D103D8">drew the attention of the Briti&s;h commander &s;o much to the &s;outhward, that he re&s;olved upon an immediate conque&s;t of Georgia; which was al&s;o de&s;irable on ac|count of the quantity of rice it produced. It was likewi&s;e known that the continental credit in Europe was chiefly upheld by the &s;outhern colonies, from whom France took off &s;uch quantities of their mo&s;t valuable productions, that their trade &s;eemed little affected by the war, farther than what it &s;uffered from the Briti&s;h cruizers.</P>
<P>The motives ju&s;t mentioned, and perhaps &s;ome oth|ers, now induced the Briti&s;h commanders to take the re&s;olution, which afterwards proved fatal to their pro&s;|pects, of dividing their force, by &s;ending a detachment to the &s;outhward. The conduct of the expedition was committed to lieutenant colonel Archibald Campbell, a brave and able officer, who&s;e &s;evere and tedious im|pri&s;onment in Concord gaol has been already related. He embarked at New York for Savannah, with a force of about 2000 men,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nov.</HI> 27.</NOTE> e&s;corted by a &s;mall &s;quadron of &s;hips of war, command|ed by commodore Hyde Parker; whil&s;t general Prevo&s;t, who commanded in Ea&s;t Florida, was directed to &s;et out with all the force he could &s;pare. The armament arrived at the i&s;land Tybee the 23d of December,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dec.</HI> 23.</NOTE> and lieutenant colonel Campbell being informed by two men whom he &s;eized, that the batteries for the defence of the town were neg|lected and out of repair, and at the &s;ame time receiv|ed &s;uch exact accounts of the &s;ituation of two armed gallies, as effectually to cut off their retreat. The troops effected a landing, under the conduct of captain Stanhope, who acted as a volunteer on the occa&s;ion, at a place which &s;eemed capable of defence again&s;t a &s;u|perior force. The lo&s;s upon the occa&s;ion was only 7 men, one of which was a very brave officer, captain
<PB N="244" REF="028963_0296_0FDE9E882814D188">Cameron, of the light infantry. The &s;ub&s;equent con|duct of the Americans, under major general Robert Howe, di&s;played equal want of re&s;olution in the men, and of military &s;kill in the commander. Having taken what he &s;uppo&s;ed to be a very &s;trong po&s;t, he con|tinued to amu&s;e him&s;elf with an idle cannonade, to which the Briti&s;h never an&s;wered a &s;ingle gun, until part of the light infantry, privately conducted by a negro through a woody &s;wamp, were ready to fall upon their rear, at the &s;ame time that they found them&s;elves attacked in front and in flank by the remainder of the army, with a well directed artillery. The Americans retreated with &s;uch rapidity, that only about 80 were killed and 30 more drowned in an attempt to cro&s;s a &s;wamp. Thirty eight commi&s;&s;ioned officers, 415 non commi&s;&s;ioned officers and privates, 48 pieces of cannon, 23 mortars, the fort with its ammunition and &s;tores, a large quantity of provi&s;ions, with the town of Savannah it&s;elf, and all the &s;hipping, in&s;tantly fell into the hands of the victors. The broken remains of the American army retreated up the river Savannah for &s;everal miles, and then took refuge in South Carolina.</P>
<P>In ten days the whole province of Georgia was reduced,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1779.</NOTE> Sunbury alone excepted; and this was al&s;o brought under &s;ubjection by gen|eral Prevo&s;t in his march northward. Every proper method was taken to &s;ecure the tranquility of the country; and rewards were offered for apprehending committee and a&s;&s;embly men, or &s;uch as they judged inimical to the Briti&s;h cau&s;e. Such was the moderation, prudence and policy of lieutenant colonel Campbell, that he effected what had never happened in America after the declaration of independence. He not only &s;ecured the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the inhabitants, but, for a time, &s;ubverted every trace of republican government, and &s;aw a legi&s;lative body convened under the authori|ty
<PB N="245" REF="028963_0296_0FDE9E882814D188">of Great Britain. On the arrival of general Prevo&s;t, the command devolved on him as &s;enior officer; and the conque&s;t of Carolina was next projected.</P>
<P>The affairs of the United States were at this period in the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, deplorable, and ruinous condition. Idlene&s;s, di&s;&s;ipation, and extravagance, &s;eemed to have engro&s;&s;ed the attention of the generality of the Ameri|can &s;ons of liberty; and &s;elf intere&s;t, &s;peculation, and an in&s;atiable thir&s;t for riches appeared to have got the better of every other con&s;ideration, and almo&s;t of every order of men. Party di&s;putes and per&s;onal quarrels were too much the general object, whil&s;t the moment|ous concerns of the empire, a va&s;t accumulation of debt, ruined finances, depreciated money, and want of credit, which naturally brings on the want of every thing, were but &s;econdary con&s;iderations, and po&s;tponed by congre&s;s from time to time, as if their affairs had been in the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing condition. The paper curren|cy in Philadelphia was daily &s;inking, and at length fell &s;o low as fifty per cent; yet an a&s;&s;embly, a concert, a dinner, or &s;upper, which co&s;t two or three hundred pounds, did not only take men off from acting, but even from thinking of what ought to have been neare&s;t their hearts. Some of the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted and pat|riotic Americans felt more di&s;tre&s;s from this review of things, than they had done at any other time, from the di&s;appointments and lo&s;&s;es in the cour&s;e of the war.</P>
<P>In the mean time mon&s;. Gerard, the French am|ba&s;&s;ador, manife&s;ted a de&s;ire, that the war might not be prolonged by too high and unrea&s;onable demands, and that the United States would reduce their ultimatum as low as po&s;&s;ible. He &s;trongly recommended moder|ation, as the fate of the war was uncertain; and he hinted, that a deci&s;ive naval engagement in favour of the Briti&s;h, might give a great turn to their affairs.</P>
<P>The South Carolina delegates had, towards the end of the former year, reque&s;ted the congre&s;s to appoint
<PB N="246" REF="028963_0297_0FDE9E8D23F02E18">general Lincoln, on who&s;e character they ju&s;tly repel|ed great confidence, to the command of all the forces to the &s;outhward. Accordingly they made the appoint|ment, and he repaired to Charle&s;ton.</P>
<P>In the attempt of the Briti&s;h upon Carolina that was no &s;mall probability of &s;ucce&s;s. The country con|tained a great number of friends to government, who now eagerly embraced the opportunity of declaring them&s;elves; mo&s;t of the inhabitants of Georgia had joined the royal &s;tandard; and there was not in the province any con&s;iderable body of provincial forces ca|pable of oppo&s;ing the efforts of regular and well di&s;ci|plined troops. On the fir&s;t news of general Prevo&s;t's approach, the loyali&s;ts a&s;&s;embled in a body, imagining them&s;elves able to &s;tand then ground until their allies &s;hould arrive; but in this they were di&s;appointed. The Americans attacked and defeated them with the lo&s;s of half their number. The remainder retreated into Georgia; and after undergoing many difficulties, at la&s;t effected a junction with the Briti&s;h forces.</P>
<P>In the mean time, general Lincoln, with a con&s;ider|able body of American troops, had encamped within 20 miles of the town of Savannah; and another &s;trong party had po&s;ted them&s;elves at a place called <HI>Briar</HI>'s <HI>Creek,</HI> farther up the river of the &s;ame name. Thus the extent of the Briti&s;h government was likely to be circum&s;cribed within very narrow bounds. General Prevo&s;t therefore determined to di&s;lodge a party under general A&s;he, con&s;i&s;ting of about 2000 men; and the latter, tru&s;ting to their &s;trong &s;ituation, and being remi&s;s in their guard,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>May</HI> 3.</NOTE> &s;uffered them|&s;elves to be &s;urpri&s;ed; when they were ut|terly routed with the lo&s;s of more than 300 killed and taken, be&s;ides a great number drowned in the river or the &s;wamps. The whole artillery, &s;tores, baggage, and almo&s;t all the arms of this unfortunate party <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> tak|en,
<PB N="247" REF="028963_0297_0FDE9E8D23F02E18">&s;o that they could no more make any &s;tand; and thus the province of Georgia was once more freed from the provincials, and a communication opened with tho&s;e places in Carolina where the royali&s;ts chiefly re|&s;ided.</P>
<P>The victory at Briar's Creek proved of con&s;iderable &s;ervice to the Briti&s;h cau&s;e. Great numbers of the loyali&s;ts joined the army, and con&s;iderably increa&s;ed its force. Hence general Prevo&s;t was enabled to &s;tretch his po&s;ts farther up the river, and to guard all the principal pa&s;&s;es: &s;o that general Lincoln was re|duced to a &s;tate of inaction; and at la&s;t moved off towards Augu&s;ta, in order to protect the provincial a&s;&s;embly, which was obliged to &s;it in that place, the capital being now in the hands of the Briti&s;h.</P>
<P>Lincoln had no &s;ooner quitted his po&s;t, than it was judged a proper time by the Briti&s;h general to put in execution the grand &s;cheme which had been meditated again&s;t Carolina. Many difficulties indeed lay in his way. The river Savannah was &s;o &s;welled by the ex|ce&s;&s;ive rains of the &s;ea&s;on, that it &s;eemed impa&s;&s;able; the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, for a great way, was &s;o full of &s;wamps and mar&s;hes, that no army could march over it without the greate&s;t difficulty; and, to render the pa&s;&s;age &s;till more difficult, general Moultrie was left with a con&s;iderable body of troops in order to oppo&s;e the enemy's attempts. But in &s;pite of every oppo&s;i|tion, the per&s;everance of the Briti&s;h troops at la&s;t pre|vailed. General Moultrie was obliged to retire tow|ards Charle&s;ton; and the pur&s;uing army, after having waded through the mar&s;hes for &s;ome time, at la&s;t ar|rived in an open country, through which they marched with great rapidity towards the capital; whil&s;t general Lincoln made preparations to march to its relief.</P>
<P>Certain intelligence of the danger to which Charle&s;|ton was expo&s;ed animated the American general. A
<PB N="248" REF="028963_0298_0FDE9E8EAA3822D0">cho&s;en body of infantry, mounted on hor&s;eback for the greater expedition, was di&s;patched before him; whil&s;t Lincoln him&s;elf followed with all the forces he could collect. General Moultrie too, with the troops he had brought from the Savannah, and &s;ome others he had collected &s;ince his retreat from thence, had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the avenues leading to Charle&s;ton, and prepared for a vigorous defence. But all oppo&s;ition proved ineffectual;
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>May</HI> 12.</NOTE> and the Brit|i&s;h army was allowed to come within can|non &s;hot of Charle&s;ton.</P>
<P>The town was now &s;ummoned to &s;urrender, and the inhabitants would gladly have agreed to ob&s;erve a neutrality during the re&s;t of the war, and would have engaged al&s;o for the re&s;t of the province. But the&s;e terms not being accepted, they made preparations for a vigorous defence. It was not, however, in the pow|er of the Briti&s;h commander at this time to make an attack with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. His artillery was not of &s;ufficient weight; there were no &s;hips to &s;up|port the attack by land: and general Lincoln advancing rapidly with a &s;uperior army, threatened to inclo&s;e him between his own force and the town; &s;o that &s;hould he fail in his fir&s;t attempt, certain de&s;truction would be the con&s;equence. For the&s;e rea&s;ons he with|drew his forces from before the town, and took po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of two i&s;lands, called <HI>St. James's</HI> and <HI>St. John's,</HI> lying to the &s;outhward; where having waited &s;ome time, his force was augmented by the arrival of two frigates. With the&s;e he determined to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Port Royal, another i&s;land po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an excellent harbour and many other natural advantages, from its &s;ituation al&s;o commanding all the &s;ea coa&s;t from Charle&s;ton to Savannah River. The American general, however, did not allow this to be accompli&s;hed without oppo&s;ition. Perceiving that his opponent had
<PB N="249" REF="028963_0298_0FDE9E8EAA3822D0">occupied an advantageous po&s;t on St. John's i&s;land, pre|paratory to his enterpri&s;e again&s;t Port Royal, he attempted to di&s;lodge them from it;
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>June</HI> 20.</NOTE> but, after an ob&s;tinate attack, the provincials were obliged to retire with con&s;iderable lo&s;s. On this occa&s;ion the &s;ucce&s;s of the Briti&s;h arms was in a great mea&s;ure owing to an armed float; which galled the right flank of the provincials &s;o effectually, that they could direct their efforts only again&s;t the &s;tronge&s;t parts of the lines, which proved impregnable to their attacks. This di&s;appointment was in&s;tantly followed by the lo&s;s of Port Royal, which general Prevo&s;t took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, and put his troops into proper &s;tations, waiting for the arrival of &s;uch reinforcements as were nece&s;&s;ary for the intended attack on Charle&s;ton.</P>
<P>The profligate conduct of the refugees, and the offi|cers and &s;oldiers of the Briti&s;h, in plundering the hou&s;es of individuals, during this incur&s;ion, is incredible. Ne|groes were &s;educed or forced from their ma&s;ters; fur|niture and plate were &s;eized without decency or au|thority; and the mo&s;t infamous violations of every law of honour and hone&s;ty were openly perpetrated.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t general Prevo&s;t was employed in the expe|ditions already related, &s;ir Henry Clinton &s;ent a naval and land force to make an inroad into Vir|ginia,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>May</HI> 10.</NOTE> under the command of &s;ir George Collier and general Mathews. The fleet having &s;afely pa&s;&s;ed the capes of Virginia, a man of war with &s;ome armed tenders were left to block up James's River, whil&s;t &s;ir George Collier, &s;hifting his pendant to a frigate, proceeded with the &s;maller &s;hips of war and tran&s;ports up Elizabeth River. The town of Port&s;mouth, and the remains of Norfolk on the op|po&s;ite &s;ide of the river, fell of cour&s;e into their hands. The Americans burned &s;ome of their own ve&s;&s;els, but others fell into the hands of the invaders. The Briti&s;h
<PB N="250" REF="028963_0299_0FDE9E902F127DC8">guards marched 18 miles in the night, and, arriving at Suffolk by morning, proceeded to the de&s;truction of ve&s;&s;els, naval &s;tores, and magazines of provi&s;ions. Ev|ery hou&s;e in the town was con&s;igned to the flames, ex|cept the church and one dwelling hou&s;e. Similar de&s;truction took place at Kemp's Landing, Shepherd's Go&s;port, Tanner's Creek, and other places in the vi|cinity. The frigates and armed ve&s;&s;els at the &s;ame time carried ruin along the margin of the rivers. Three thou&s;and hog&s;heads of tobacco were taken at Port&s;mouth. Above 130 ve&s;&s;els in all were either de&s;troyed or taken, exclu&s;ive of tho&s;e which were on the &s;tocks; and &s;everal thou&s;and barrels of pork, with other provi&s;ions in proportion, which had been pre|pared for general Wa&s;hington's army, were de&s;troyed; as were likewi&s;e all kind of &s;tores which could not be carried off. The fleet and army, after demoli&s;hing Fort Nel&s;on, and &s;etting fire to the &s;tore hou&s;es and other public buildings in the dock yard at Go&s;port, returned with their prizes and booty &s;afe to New York, in the &s;ame month in which they had left it.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s with which this expedition was attend|ed, induced &s;ir Henry Clinton to attempt another. The provincials had been for &s;ome time engaged in erecting two &s;trong forts on the North River; the one at Ver|plank's Neck on the ea&s;t, and the other at Stoney Point on the we&s;t &s;ide. The&s;e, when completed, would have been of the utmo&s;t &s;ervice to the Americans, as com|manding the principal pa&s;s called <HI>King's Ferry,</HI> between the northern and &s;outhern colonies. As the&s;e were nearly completed, but not yet defen&s;ible, &s;ir Henry thought it a proper time to avail him&s;elf of their in|du&s;try, and to reap the fruits of their toil; general Wa&s;hington being at too great a di&s;tance, and other|wi&s;e incapable of giving any interruption.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="028963_0299_0FDE9E902F127DC8">
The troops embarked for this &s;ervice, were commanded by major general Vaughan,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>May</HI> 30.</NOTE> and before they &s;et &s;ail were joined by the force from Che&s;apeak, with whom they proceeded up the North River. Next day general Vaughan, with the greater part of the army landed on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the river about eight miles from Verplanks; whil&s;t the remainder, under the conduct of general Patti&s;on, and accompanied by the commander in chief, advancing farther up, landed within three miles of Stoney Point. On the appearrance of the &s;hips, the Americans aban|doned the place, after &s;etting fire to a large block hou&s;e; and though &s;ome &s;hew of re&s;i&s;tance was made on the approach of the troops to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Stoney Point, they did not venture to &s;tand an en|gagement.</P>
<P>On the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river, the Americans had completed a &s;mall but &s;trong fort called La Fayette, which was defended by four pieces of artillery, and a garri&s;on of between 70 and 80 men. But the little redoubt was effectually commanded by Stoney Point, which is &s;ituated at about 1000 yards di&s;tance on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore; and being exceedingly difficult of ap|proach on its own &s;ide, at lea&s;t for the conveyance of artillery, the attack was accordingly intended from the other. For this purpo&s;e, a party under general Patti|&s;on, with infinite fatigue and labour, during the night, overcame the difficulties of dragging the heavy artillery from a very bad landing place, up a &s;teep precipice to the top of the hill, and by five in the morning had open|ed a battery of cannon, and another of mortars, on the &s;ummit of the difficult rocks of Stoney Point, which poured a dreadful fire on Fort la Fayette; whil&s;t Vaughan with his divi&s;ion, making a long circuit round the hills, arrived and clo&s;ely inve&s;ted it by land. In the mean time &s;ir George Collier advanced with the
<PB N="252" REF="028963_0300_0FDE9E9C1972A600">gallies and gunboats within reach of the &s;ort; and as &s;oon as it was dark anchored two of his gallies above it, &s;o as to prevent the e&s;cape of the garri&s;on by water. The garri&s;on, finding their &s;ire overpowered, and their e&s;cape cut off, &s;urrendered them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war next morning, without any other &s;tipulation than hu|mane treatment. Sir Henry Clinton, moving his main body up the North River, occa&s;ioned the American ar|my to move from their encampment at Middlebrook towards We&s;t Point, for which they were in fear, the garri&s;on being few, and the fort not completed. Sir Henry Clinton gave directions for completing the works of both the captured po&s;ts. For their better &s;upport, and with a view to farther operations, he encamped his army at Phillip&s;burgh, about half way down the river towards New York I&s;land. By the lo&s;s of the&s;e po&s;ts, the provincials in the Jer|&s;eys were under a nece&s;&s;ity of making a circuit of above ninety miles through the mountains, to commu|nicate with the countries ea&s;t of Hud&s;on's River.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of the ho&s;tile armies on both &s;ides, with re&s;pect to actual force, together with the want of mon|ey and deficiency of military provi&s;ions on the one &s;ide, nece&s;&s;arily limited the views of the oppo&s;ite command|ers, and prevented their undertaking any deci&s;ive or exten&s;ive operations. They were each in a &s;trong &s;tate of defence, and neither had &s;uch a &s;uperiority <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> force as could compel the other to relinqui&s;h the advantages of his &s;ituation. General Wa&s;hington was, be&s;ides, in expectation of foreign aid; and it would have been incon&s;i&s;tent with his u&s;ual caution and judgment, to have run the hazard, by any previous attempt, of weak|ening his &s;trength to &s;uch a degree as might render him incapable of profiting by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his ally, and the American arms and force of cour&s;e contempt|ible in his eyes. The campaign was accordingly lan|guid,
<PB N="253" REF="028963_0300_0FDE9E9C1972A600">and its operations confined to the &s;urpri&s;e of po&s;ts and to de&s;ultory excur&s;ions; to the la&s;t of which, the Americans were now, as well as at all times ex|ceedingly expo&s;ed, and upon no footing of equality with their enemy.</P>
<P>The numberle&s;s &s;mall crui&s;ers, whale boats, and oth|er &s;mall craft from the Connecticut coa&s;ts, which in|fe&s;ted the Sound, lying between that &s;tate and Long I&s;land, were &s;o watchful in their depredations, and their &s;ituation afforded them &s;uch opportunities, that they had nearly de&s;troyed the trade to and from New York on that &s;ide, to the great di&s;tre&s;s of the city, as well as of the fleet and army. Upon this account, &s;ir Henry Clinton and &s;ir George Collier, determined on a cour&s;e of de&s;ultory inva&s;ions on that coa&s;t, with a view of curing the evil, by cutting off the means of depredation in the de&s;truction of their privateers, and, as far as it could be done, of their other ve&s;&s;els and materials for building,</P>
<P>Governour Tryon was appointed to con|duct the land forces,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>July</HI> 5.</NOTE> con&s;i&s;ting of about 2,600 men, and he was &s;econded by brigadier gen|eral Garth, an officer of di&s;tingui&s;hed merit and ability. The forces were landed at the town of New Heaven, which they in&s;tantly took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, as well as of a battery which covered it, without any great lo&s;s, though con&s;iderable re&s;i&s;tance was made by the inhabitants and militia. The fort with all the naval and military &s;tores were de&s;troyed; but the town, though at fir&s;t doomed to de&s;truction, was &s;pared, as the militia had not attempted to mole&s;t the troops in their retreat. From New Haven the &s;leet &s;ailed to Fairfield, where the troops were again landed and again oppo&s;ed. Here the town was &s;et on fire, and con&s;umed, with every thing of value; and the &s;ame de&s;olation took place at Norwalk, where the militia were more numerous, and
<PB N="254" REF="028963_0301_0FDE9E9DA0C95750">made a greater re&s;i&s;tance than in other places. Here the lo&s;s of the Americans was great; both Norwalk and Greenfield, a &s;mall town in the neighbourhood, were totally de&s;troyed, with a con&s;iderable number of &s;hips either fini&s;hed or on the &s;tocks, and a &s;till greater number of whale boats and &s;mall craft, with &s;tores and merchandize to a large amount. The places taken were generally plundered: whigs and tories, indi&s;|criminately, though not univer&s;ally, had their money, plate, rings and other articles taken from them; and much of their furniture was wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ly de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>The fires and de&s;truction which accompanied this expedition, were &s;everely cen&s;ured by the Americans, and apologi&s;ed for by the Briti&s;h in a very un&s;atisfac|tory manner. The latter, in their vindication, alleged that the hou&s;es which they had burned gave &s;helter to the Americans, whil&s;t they fired from them, and on other occa&s;ions concealed their retreat. Governour Tryon undertook to ju&s;tify the&s;e mea&s;ures on princi|ples of policy. "I &s;hould be very &s;orry," &s;aid he, "if the de&s;truction of the&s;e villages would be thought le&s;s reconcileable to humanity, than the love of my coun|try, my duty to the king, and the laws of arms. The u&s;urpers have profe&s;&s;edly placed their hopes of &s;evering the empire in avoiding deci&s;ive actions&mdash;upon the wa&s;te of the Briti&s;h trea&s;ures, and upon the e&s;cape of their own property during the protracting of the war. Their power is &s;upported by the general dread of their tyranny and threats, practi&s;ed to in&s;pire a credulous multitude with a pre&s;umptuous confidence in our forbearance; I wi&s;h to detect this delu&s;ion."</P>
<P>Among other views of the Briti&s;h commander in the Connecticut expedition, it was &s;uppo&s;ed to be a probable method of drawing general Wa&s;hington from his &s;trong po&s;ts in the high lands into the low country, where he might be forced to a battle on di&s;advanta|geous
<PB N="255" REF="028963_0301_0FDE9E9DA0C95750">terms; but this cautious general, in every in|&s;tance, avoided the &s;nare. And although general Par|&s;ons was clo&s;ely connected with Connecticut, and, from his &s;mall force, unable to make &s;ucce&s;sful oppo|&s;ition to the invaders, in&s;tead of pre&s;&s;ing general Wa&s;h|ington for a large detachment of continental troops, he wrote to him as follows; "The Briti&s;h may prob|ably di&s;tre&s;s the country exceedingly, by the ravages they will commit, but I would rather &s;ee all the towns on the coa&s;t of my country in flames, than that the enemy &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s We&s;t Point."</P>
<P>The&s;e deva&s;tations, however, were &s;ud|denly &s;topped by a peremptory order from general Clinton for the return of the troops,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>July</HI> 13.</NOTE> on the 13th of July, only eight days after they began. The lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by the Briti&s;h troops was very tri|fling; not exceeding 150 in killed, wounded and mi&s;&s;|ing. The expedition, however, &s;eems not to have been attended with any great effect as to its immediate pur|po&s;e, for &s;o bold and numerous did the American troops continue, that in a few days two of the royal &s;loops of war were taken by them.</P>
<P>On the &s;urpri&s;e of Stoney Point and Verplank, gen|eral Wa&s;hington had taken po&s;t among the high grounds farther up the North River, only with a de|&s;ign of watching the motions of the Briti&s;h army. No &s;ooner did he ob&s;erve how &s;ir Henry Clinton had &s;trengthened the&s;e po&s;ts, than he entertained the de|&s;ign of &s;urpri&s;ing them. Having received notice from a de&s;erter, that there was a &s;andy beach on the &s;outh &s;ide o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Stoney Point, running along the flank of the works, and only ob&s;tructed by a &s;ingle abbatis, which might afford an ea&s;y and &s;afe approach to a body of troops; he formed the plan of attacking both po&s;ts at the &s;ame in&s;tant; the execution of which was intru&s;t|ed to general Wayne and general Howe. The garri|&s;on

That in the oppo&s;ite po&s;t, at Verplank's Neck, of nearly equal force, was under the command of lieutenant colonel Web&s;ter. All the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett light infantry marched from We&s;t Point under lieuten|ant colonel Hull, in the morning of the 15th of July,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>July</HI> 15.</NOTE> and joined general Wayne, at San|dy Beach, 14 miles from Stoney Point. The roads were exceedingly bad and narrow, and the troops having to pa&s;s over high mountains, through difficult defiles and mora&s;&s;es, were obliged to move in &s;ingle files the greate&s;t part of the way. By eight in the evening, the van arrived within a mile and a half of the enemy, where the men, being formed in two columns, remained till general Wayne and &s;everal of the principal officers returned from reconnoitring the works. General Wayne i&s;&s;ued the mo&s;t po&s;itive or|ders to both columns, which they &s;eem to have exactly obeyed, not to fire a &s;ingle &s;hot on any account, but to place their whole reliance on the bayonet. At half pa&s;t eleven at night the whole moved forward to the attack. Two attacks were, therefore, made on the op|po&s;ite &s;ides of the fortification, to which the &s;oldiers marched with unloaded mu&s;kets and &s;crewed bayonets, whil&s;t a detachment in front amu&s;ed the garri&s;on with a feint. They found the approaches more difficult than, from their knowledge of the place, they had been led to expect, the works being covered by a deep mo|ra&s;s, which at this time was overflowed by the tide.</P>
<P>But neither the deep mora&s;s, the formidable and double rows of abattis on the &s;trong works in front and flank, could damp the ardour of the Americans, who, in the face of an ince&s;&s;ant and tremendous fire of mu&s;ket|ry, and cannon loaded with grape &s;hot, forced their way through every ob&s;tacle, until the van of each col|umn
<PB N="257" REF="028963_0302_0FDE9E9F2750E930">met in the centre of the works, and the garri&s;on were obliged to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion. General Wayne was wounded in the head by a mu&s;ket ball as he pa&s;&s;ed the la&s;t abbatis, but was gallantly &s;upported and helped through the works by his two brave aids, Fi&s;hbourn and Archer. The killed and wounded of the Americans amounted to 98. Lieutenants Gibbons and Knox, who led the forlorn hope, e&s;caped unhurt, although the fir&s;t lo&s;t 17 men out of 20, and the la&s;t nearly as many. The killed of the garri&s;on were 63, and the number of the pri&s;oners 543. Two flags, two &s;tandards, 15 pieces of ordnance, and a con&s;iderable quantity of military &s;tores, fell into the hands of the conquerors.</P>
<P>For this heroic action, congre&s;s gave thanks to gen|eral Wayne, and pa&s;&s;ed re&s;olutions honourable to the officers and men concerned in it. They ordered a gold medal, emblematical of the action, to be pre&s;ented to the general, and &s;ilver ones to lieutenant colonel Fleury and major Stewart; the former having &s;truck the &s;tandard with his own hand.</P>
<P>The attack upon Verplank, entru&s;ted with general Howe, mi&s;carried, through delay occa&s;ioned by high winds which prevented the tran&s;portation of the artil|lery. The enemy, likewi&s;e, broke down the bridges, and thereby cut off the communication by land.</P>
<P>The Americans evacuated Stoney Point, after hav|ing removed the cannon and &s;tores, and demoli&s;hed the works: and the third day after the capture, &s;ir Henry Clinton regained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and left a &s;trong gar|ri&s;on for its defence.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s of the late enterpri&s;e emboldened the Americans to make a &s;imilar attempt on Paulus Hook, a fortified po&s;t on the Jer&s;ey &s;ide, oppo&s;ite to New York; but, although the heroi&s;m of the enterpri&s;e and the &s;pirit with which it was executed de&s;erves applau&s;e,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>July</HI> 19.</NOTE> after having

<P>Another expedition of greater importance was now projected on the part of the Americans. This was again&s;t a po&s;t on the river Penob&s;cot, on the borders of Nova Scotia, of which the Briti&s;h had lately taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>June</HI> 16.</NOTE> and where they had began to erect a fort which threatened to be a very great inconvenience to the coloni&s;ts. A fleet of 18 armed ve&s;&s;els, be&s;ides tran&s;ports, were fitted out, and put under the conduct of commodore Salton&s;tal. The land forces were commanded by general Lovel. The armament de&s;tined again&s;t it was &s;o &s;oon got in readi|ne&s;s, that colonel Macleane, the commanding officer at Penob&s;cot, found him&s;elf obliged to drop the execution of part of his &s;cheme; and in&s;tead of a regular &s;ort, to content him&s;elf with putting the works already con|&s;tructed in as good a po&s;ture of defence as po&s;&s;ible. The Americans could not effect a landing without a great deal of difficulty, and bringing the guns of their large&s;t ve&s;&s;els to bear upon the &s;hore.
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>July</HI> 28.</NOTE> As &s;oon as this was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ne, however, they erected &s;everal batteries, and kept up a bri&s;k &s;ire for the &s;pace of a fortnight; after which they propo&s;ed to give a general a&s;&s;ault: but before this could be ef|fected, they perceived &s;ir George Collier with a Briti&s;h fleet failing up the river to attack them.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>COUNT D'E&s;taing, as has been already ob&s;erv|ed, had put into Bo&s;ton harbour to refit. Zeal|ous in the cau&s;e of his ma&s;ter, he had publi&s;hed a proc|lamation to be di&s;per&s;ed through Canada, inviting the people to return to their original friend&s;hip with France, and declaring that all who renounced their allegiance
<PB N="260" REF="028963_0304_0FDE9EA9E4A04820">to Great Britain, &s;hould certainly find a protector in the king of France. All his endeavours, however, proved in&s;ufficient to produce any revolution, or even to form a party of any con&s;equence among the Ca|nadians.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the French admiral had repaired and victualled his fleet, he took the opportunity, while that of admiral Biron had been &s;hattered by a &s;torm,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nov.</HI> 3.</NOTE> of &s;ailing to the We&s;t Indies. On the &s;ame day, commodore Hotham with five men of war, a bomb ve&s;&s;el and &s;ome frigates, &s;et out from New York, to convoy a number of tran&s;ports with general Grant and 5000 men to the &s;ame theatre of war.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h took St. Lucia, and count D'E&s;taing took St. Vincent and Grenada.
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dec.</HI> 13.</NOTE> Soon after the reduction of the latter, the count retired to Cape Francois. During his operations there, the Americans having repre&s;ented his conduct as totally un&s;erviceable to them,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>July,</HI> 1779.</NOTE> he received or|ders from Europe to a&s;&s;i&s;t the United States with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed.</P>
<P>In compliance with the&s;e orders, he directed his cour&s;e towards Georgia, with a de&s;ign, in conjunction with general Lincoln, to recover that province out of the hands of the enemy, and to put it as well as South Carolina, in &s;uch a po&s;ture of defence as would effec|tually &s;ecure them from any future attack. This &s;eem|ed to be no difficult matter, from the litle force with which he knew he &s;hould be oppo&s;ed; and the next object in contemplation was no le&s;s than the de&s;truc|tion of the Briti&s;h fleet and army at New York, and their total expul&s;ion from the continent of America. Full of the&s;e hopes the French commander arrived off the coa&s;t of Georgia, with a fleet con&s;i&s;ting of twenty &s;ail of the line,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sept.</HI> 1.</NOTE> two of fifty guns and eleven frigates, and a large body of land
<PB N="261" REF="028963_0304_0FDE9EA9E4A04820">forces on board. His arrival was &s;o little expected, that &s;everal ve&s;&s;els, laden with provi&s;ions and military &s;tores, fell into his hands. The Experiment al&s;o, a ve&s;|&s;el of 50 guns, commanded by &s;ir James Wallace, and three frigates, were al&s;o taken. On the 9th the fleet anchored off Tybee, at the mouth of the river Savan|nah. On the continent the Briti&s;h troops were divid|ed. General Prevo&s;t, with an incon&s;iderable part, remained at Savannah; but the main force was under colonel Maitland at Port Royal. On the fir&s;t appear|ance of the French fleet, an expre&s;s was &s;ent to colonel Maitland: but it was intercepted by the Americans; &s;o that before he could &s;et out to join the commander in chief, the Americans had &s;ecured mo&s;t of the pa&s;&s;es by land, whil&s;t the French fleet effectually blocked up the pa&s;&s;age by &s;ea. On the 15th, the French, with count Pola&s;ki's light hor&s;e, appeared &s;o near the Briti&s;h lines as to &s;kirmi&s;h with the piquets; and as the force under general Prevo&s;e did not admit of his having any other object in view than the mere defence of the town, he contracted his po&s;ts within the cover of the artillery on the works.</P>
<P>D'E&s;taing &s;ent a &s;ummons to Prevo&s;t, commanding him, in the name of his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian maje&s;ty, to yield to a force he was utterly incapable of re&s;i&s;ting. Though general Prevo&s;t, with the officers about him, were determined, even with the &s;mall force they had, to defend the place to the la&s;t extremity, yet they thought it prudent to gain as much time as po&s;&s;ible. By &s;end|ing different me&s;&s;ages, therefore, he found means to protract the time con&s;iderably, and at la&s;t was allowed a truce of 24 hours for deliberation. During this in|terval colonel Maitland, taking advantage of creeks and inlets, and marching over land, arrived with the troops from Port Royal.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="028963_0305_0FDE9EAF4DDDE958">
The face of affairs was now entirely changed, and in&s;tead of an ea&s;y conque&s;t which pre&s;ented it&s;elf on the arrival of D'E&s;taing, a mo&s;t ob&s;tinate defence was re&s;olved on. The general returned a po&s;itive an&s;wer to the &s;ummons, that he was determined to defend the place to the la&s;t extremity; and the &s;ailors who had been all drawn from the &s;hips to con&s;truct and man the batteries, expre&s;&s;ed their approbation by three checes, when the gun was fired as a &s;ignal for the recommence|ment of ho&s;tilities.</P>
<P>On the day after delivering the &s;ummons D'E&s;taing was joined by general Lincoln, as he had been before by count Pola&s;ki. The allies took &s;eparate but adjoin|ing camps, and each began immediately to make ap|proaches as in a regular &s;iege. Their joint force h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> been computed at about 9000 men, whil&s;t that of the garri&s;on did not exceed 3000. The utmo&s;t exertions, however, were made on the part of the Briti&s;h. Every man, without di&s;tinction, was employed in the harde&s;t labour, and cheerfully underwent his &s;hare of the com|mon toil. At the time that the French &s;ummons was received, the lines were not only weak and imperfect but were not protected by above eight or ten pieces of cannon, while at the conclu&s;ion of the &s;iege or blockade, the works, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;hip guns, were cor|cred with a numerous artillery amounting to near 100 pieces. Nor was the &s;kill and dexterity with which they were u&s;ed and directed by captain Moncrief, the engineer, at all inferior to the labour u&s;ed in bringing them forward, as was owned both by friends and fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">.</P>
<P>The allies were indefatigable in their efforts to in|terrupt the works, though without effect; nor did they &s;pare any pains in carrying on their own, &s;o that in a week they had pu&s;hed a &s;ap within 300 yards of the abbatis. Few &s;kirmi&s;hes took place, as the Briti&s;h com|mander wi&s;hed to &s;pare his men; but in the few that were fought the allies were wor&s;ted.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="028963_0305_0FDE9EAF4DDDE958">
About midnight, between the 3d and 4th of October, the allies began a heavy bombardment, and at day light a violent cannonade from 37 pieces of heavy artillery, nine mortars from their land batteries, and 16 cannon from the water. Though this cannonade continued for five days, its de&s;tructive effects were felt only by the women, children and negroes, and by the hou&s;es of the town; the works, &s;o far from being demoli&s;hed, con|tinually acquired additional &s;trength, through the in|du&s;try of the be&s;ieged.&mdash;In this di&s;tre&s;s of the women and children, which was farther increa&s;ed by the car|ca&s;&s;es, in order to &s;et the town on fire, general Prevo&s;t &s;ent a letter to D'E&s;taing requiring permi&s;&s;ion for the women and children to leave the place; but after three hours, during which the di&s;charge of cannon and &s;hells continued, the allied commanders, from motives of policy, refu&s;ed compliance, and they re&s;ulved to give a general a&s;&s;ault.</P>
<P>This attack was made in the morning of the 9th of October,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Oct.</HI> 9.</NOTE> a little before day light, after a heavy di&s;charge of cannon and mortars for &s;everal hours. The firing began on the left of the Briti&s;h lines, but &s;oon after became general.</P>
<P>The nature of the ground on both flanks of the lines was &s;o favourable to the approach of the a&s;&s;ailants, that the defect could not be remedied by all the &s;kill of the engineer: And as it was &s;till too dark for the Briti&s;h to di&s;cern the movements of the allies, and uncertain where the &s;torm would fall, each divi&s;ion waited cooly in its po&s;t; expecting what &s;hould happen. The grand attack was made however, to the right, whither D'E&s;taing in per&s;on led the flower of both armies, and was ac|companied by all the principal officers of each. They advanced in three columns, under cover of a &s;wampy hollow, which reached within a very little di&s;tance of &s;ome of the principal works. By rea&s;on of the dark|ne&s;s
<PB N="264" REF="028963_0306_0FDE9EB0D57E55A8">of the night, they took a greater circuit, and went deeper into the bog than they needed to have done; a circum&s;tance, which, be&s;ides a critical lo&s;s of time, could not fail of producing &s;ome di&s;order. The at|tack was made with great &s;pirit, and &s;upported with ob&s;tinate per&s;everance. One redoubt, particularly, was the &s;cene of much gallantry. It was ob&s;tinately de|&s;ended by captain Taw&s;e. The a&s;&s;ailants planted two &s;tand of colours upon it; and at length the brave cap|tain fell, gallantly fighting in his redoubt, his &s;word being plunged, at the in&s;tant of death, in the body of the third man he had killed with his own hand.&mdash;But whil&s;t the combat was &s;till dubious and bloody, partic|ularly at that redoubt, three batteries, which were oc|cupied by the &s;eamen, opened upon the allies in almo&s;t every direction, and made &s;uch havock in their ranks as cau&s;ed &s;ome little di&s;order, or at lea&s;t a pau&s;e in the violence of their attack. At that in&s;tant, a body of grenadiers and marines advanced &s;uddenly from the lines, and charged the allies with &s;uch rapidity and fu|ry, throwing them&s;elves into the ditches and works a|mong them, that in an in&s;tant the redoubt and a bat|tery to the right of it, were totally cleared of them. The advantage was pur&s;ued with the greate&s;t vigour; the allies were in&s;tantly routed, and driven into the &s;wamp with &s;uch celerity, that three companies of the mo&s;t active troops of the be&s;ieged, could not, with all their exertion, come in for any &s;hare of the honour. The pur&s;uit was prevented by a thick fog and darkne&s;s, which hindered the Briti&s;h general from perceiving how far it was proper to venture his troops out of the town. As the day cleared, the works and ditches near the redoubt pre&s;ented a mo&s;t &s;hocking &s;pectacle of kill|ed and wounded, &s;aid by &s;ome &s;oldiers and officers to have been only equalled at Bunker's Hill. At 10 o'clock, the allies reque&s;ted leave to carry off their wounded
<PB N="265" REF="028963_0306_0FDE9EB0D57E55A8">and bury their dead; which, with &s;ome re&s;trictions as to the former, was granted.</P>
<P>In this fatal attack, which la&s;ted fifty five minutes, the lo&s;s of the allies was computed at between 1000 and 1200 men in killed and wounded. The French owned 44 officers, and about 700 private men in killed and wounded.&mdash;The lo&s;s of the Americans, by the re|turn made to general Lincoln, was 234 continentals killed and wounded. Count Pola&s;ki, the celebrated con&s;pirator again&s;t the reigning king of Poland, was mortally wounded. Count D'E&s;taing was likewi&s;e wounded, but &s;lightly.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s on the Briti&s;h &s;ide was inconceivably &s;mall; and no other officer was lo&s;t except captain Taw&s;e, who had &s;o bravely defended the redoubt where the &s;tandards were placed.</P>
<P>General Prevo&s;t, lieutenant colonel Maitland, and major Moncrief de&s;ervedly acquired great reputation by this &s;ucce&s;sful defence. The allies now thought of nothing but to get away with &s;afety, and it was nece&s;|&s;ary to ma&s;k this with the appearance of continuing the blockade. Great civilities now pa&s;&s;ed between the French and the Briti&s;h; and numberle&s;s apologies were made for the refu&s;al with re&s;pect to the women and children. They were now pre&s;&s;ed to place them&s;elves in the &s;ituation they had formerly reque&s;ted; and a particular &s;hip of war and commander were named for the reception of Mrs. Prevo&s;t, her children and compa|ny. But the an&s;wer was, that what had been refu&s;ed and that in terms of in&s;ult, could not in any circum&s;tance be deemed worth accepting. On the 18th of the month,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Oct.</HI> 18.</NOTE> upon the clearing up of the fog, it was di&s;covered that the French and Americans had abandoned their camps in the preceding night. Some pur&s;uit was made, but without effect; the Ameri|cans having broken down the bridges behind them, and
<PB N="266" REF="028963_0307_0FDE9EB25D38B680">pur&s;ued their route with great di&s;patch. Count D'E&s;|taing had reembarked his troops, artillery and baggage, and left the continent; and general Lincoln returned to South Carolina.</P>
<P>This expedition of D'E&s;taing on the American coa&s;t, though un&s;ucce&s;sful as to its main object, was eventu|ally of benefit to the United States. It entirely di&s;con|certed the mea&s;ures already dige&s;ted by the Briti&s;h commanders, and cau&s;ed a con&s;iderable wa&s;te of time, before they could determine on a new plan of operations. It al&s;o occa&s;ioned the evacuation of Rhode I&s;land; but this was rather a lo&s;s than advantage to America. For the Briti&s;h had &s;tationed near 6000 men, for two years and eight months, on that i&s;land, where they were lo&s;t to every purpo&s;e of cooperation, and where they could render very little more &s;ervice to the royal cau&s;e, than could have been obtained by a couple of frigates crui&s;|ing in the vicinity.</P>
<P>During the &s;iege of Savarmah, a remarkable enter|pri&s;e was effected by colonel John White of the Geor|gia line. Captain French had taken po&s;t with about 100 men near the river Ogechee, &s;ome time before the fiege began. There were al&s;o at the &s;ame place forty &s;ailors on board of five Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els, four of which were armed. All the&s;e men, together with the ve&s;&s;els and 130 &s;tand of arms, were &s;urrendered to colonel White, captain Elholm, and four others, one of which was the colonel's &s;ervant. On the preceding night this &s;mall party kindled a number of fires in different places, and adopted the parade of a large encampment. By the&s;e and a variety of deceptive &s;tratagems, captain French was fully impre&s;&s;ed with the opinion, that noth|ing but an in&s;tant &s;urrender, in conformity to a peremp|tory &s;ummons, could &s;ave his men from being cut to pieces by a &s;uperior force. He therefore gave up, with|out making any re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="028963_0307_0FDE9EB25D38B680">
The arms of France and America being almo&s;t ev|ery where un&s;ucce&s;sful, the independency of the latter &s;eemed yet to be in danger, notwith&s;tanding the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of &s;o powerful an ally, when further encourage|ment was given by the acce&s;&s;ion of Spain to the con|federacy again&s;t Britain, in the month of June 1779.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t effect of this appeared in the inva&s;ion of the infant colony on the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi; which being yet too weak for a particular government, was annexed to that of We&s;t Florida; which was, however, too di&s;tant to afford any effectual protection. We have al&s;o taken notice of an expedition by the Americans, under cap|tain Willing, into that country, though they did not &s;tay to enforce their dominion. The few troops which were in the colony were &s;uddenly attacked by Don Bernardo de Gulves,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Augu&s;t.</HI></NOTE> governour of Lou|i&s;mia, with the whole force he could collect; who, having fir&s;t publicly declared the independency of Briti&s;h America by beat of drum, at New Orleans, &s;et out on his expedition. His mea&s;ures were &s;o well concerted, that major general Campbell, who command|ed at Pen&s;acola, did not receive the &s;malle&s;t intelligence of his proceedings, until the affair was almo&s;t over. The troops did not amount to 500 men; however, they &s;tood a &s;iege of nine days in a field redoubt at Batton Rouge, and capitulated on honourable terms, to which the Spani&s;h governour &s;trictly adhered.</P>
<P>Their next enterpri&s;e, was again&s;t the Bay of Hon|duras, where the Briti&s;h logwood cutters were &s;ettled. The&s;e, finding them&s;elves too weak to re&s;i&s;t, applied to the governour of Jamaica for relief; who &s;ent them a &s;upply of men, ammunition, and military &s;tores, under captain Dalrymple. Before the arrival of this detach|ment, the principal &s;ettlement in tho&s;e parts, called <HI>St. George's Key,</HI> had been taken by the Spaniards and retaken by the Briti&s;h.

<PB N="268" REF="028963_0308_0FDE9EBA2DC75088">fell in with a &s;quadron from Admiral Parker in &s;earch of &s;ome regi&s;ter &s;hips richly laden; but which, re|treating into the harbour of Omoa, were too &s;trongly protected by the fort to be attacked with &s;afety. A project was then formed, in conjunction with the peo|ple of Honduras, to reduce this fort. The de&s;ign was to &s;urpri&s;e it; but the Spaniards having di&s;|covered them,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Oct.</HI> 16.</NOTE> they were obliged to fight. Victory quickly declared for the Briti&s;h; but the fortifications were &s;o &s;trong, that the artillery, they had brought along with them were found too light to make any impre&s;&s;ion. It was then determined to try the &s;ucce&s;s of an e&s;calade; and this was execut|ed with &s;o much &s;pirit, that the Spaniards &s;tood a&s;ton|i&s;hed without making any re&s;i&s;tance, and, in &s;pite of all the efforts of the officers, threw down their arms and &s;urrendered. The &s;poil was immen&s;e, being valued at three millions of dollars. The Spaniards chiefly la|mented the lo&s;s of 250 quintals of quick&s;ilver; a com|modity indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary in the working of their gold and &s;ilver mines, &s;o that they offered to ran&s;om it at any price; but this was refu&s;ed, as well as the ran|&s;om of the fort, though the governour offered 300,000 dollars for it. A &s;mall garri&s;on was left for the defence of the place: but it was quickly attacked by a &s;uperior force, and obliged to evacuate it, though not without de&s;troying every thing that could be of u&s;e to the ene|my; &s;piking the guns, and even locking the gates of the fort and carrying off the keys. All this was done in &s;ight of the be&s;iegers; after which the garri&s;on em|barked without the lo&s;s of a man.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;sful defence of Savannah, together with the &s;ub&s;equent departure of count D'E&s;taing from the coa&s;t of the United States, freed the Briti&s;h from all apprehen&s;ions for the &s;afety of New York, and &s;ir Henry Clinton &s;et &s;ail from that place in the end of

<P>Several detached events, which could not be introdu|ced without interrupting the narrative of the preced|ing campaigns, &s;hall clo&s;e this chapter.</P>
<P>The Randolph, an American frigate of 36 guns and 305 men,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1778, <HI>March</HI> 7.</NOTE> commanded by cap|tain Biddle, &s;ailed on a crui&s;e from Charle&s;|ton. The Yarmouth of 64 guns, di&s;covered her and five other ve&s;&s;els, and came up with her in the evening. Captain Vincent hailed the Randolph, to hoi&s;t colours, or he would fire into her; on which &s;he hoi&s;ted American colours and immediately gave the Yarmouth her broad&s;ide, which was returned, and in about a quarter of an hour &s;he blew up. Four men &s;aved them&s;elves upon a piece of her wreck, and &s;ub|fi&s;ted for five days upon nothing but rain water, which they &s;ucked from a piece of blanket. On the fifth day, captain Vincent of the Yarmouth, being in cha&s;e of a &s;hip, happily di&s;covered them, and humanely &s;u&s;|pending the cha&s;e, took them on board. Three days before this, the Alfred frigate, of 20 nine pounders, was taken by the Ariadne and Ceres. The Americans al&s;o lo&s;t the Virginia frigate.</P>
<P>Major Talbot took the Briti&s;h &s;chooner Pi|got,

The major, with a number of troops, on board a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el, made directly for the Pigot in the night, and &s;u&s;taining the fire of her marines, re&s;erved his own till he had run his jib-boom through her fore &s;hrouds. He then fired &s;ome cannon, and threw in a volley of mu&s;ketry, loaded with bullets and buck &s;hot, and immediately boarded her. The captain made a gallant re&s;i&s;tance, but was not &s;econded by his crew. Major Talbot having gain|ed undi&s;turbed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, carried off his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in &s;afety.

<P>Although little was performed in the year 1779 by the contending fleets either in Europ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> or in America,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1779.</NOTE> a great number of well fought and de&s;perate actions took place between &s;ingle &s;hips both of the old and new world. Of the&s;e the battle between Paul Jones and &s;ir Richard Pear&s;on is as re|markable as any. Jones had for &s;ome time infe&s;ted the coa&s;t of Scotland. In April 1778, he &s;ailed from Port&s;mouth, New Hamp&s;hire, as commander of the Ranger privateer, and landed in the night at White haven, in Cumberland, with a party of 30 men; and &s;et fire to one of the &s;hips in the harbour; but the in|habitants extingui&s;hed the fire before it reached <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> rigging. He then landed &s;ome men in the we&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> coa&s;t of Scotland, and plundered the hou&s;e of lord Sel|kirk, near Kircubright, of plate, jewels, and other valu|able articles. He was a Scotchman by birth, and is &s;aid to have lived formerly with his lord&s;hip. In the lat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> end of July 1779, he &s;ailed from Port l'Orient, as cont|mander of a &s;quadron, con&s;i&s;ting of the Bon Homme Richard, of 40 guns and 375 men, the Alliance of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> guns, the Pallas, a French frigate of 32, the Vengeance an armed brig of 12, together with a cutter. Having alarmed the Scotch and Iri&s;h coa&s;ts, and made capture nearly to the value of &pound;. 40,000, he at length fell i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with the Baltic fleet, off Flamborough Head under the protection of the Serapis,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sept.</HI> 23.</NOTE> captain Pear&s;on, and the Counte&s;s of Scarborough captain Piercy. Captain Pear&s;on, by four o'clock, plain|ly di&s;cerning from the deck, that the &s;quadron con&s;i&s;t|ed of three large &s;hips, and a brig, (the cutter was not now with them) made the Counte&s;s of Scarborough a &s;ignal to join him, which was done about half pa&s;t five. A little after &s;even, the Bon Homme Richard brought
<PB N="271" REF="028963_0309_0FDE9EBE88F1F290">no within mu&s;ket &s;hot of the Serapis, when the fight legan, and was maintained with equal fury on both <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, each ve&s;&s;el u&s;ing every po&s;&s;ible means to gain an advantageous &s;ituation to rake the other. Captain per&s;on had infinitely the &s;uperiority over the Bon Homme Richard in working the Serapis, and obtained advantages in &s;pite of every effort of Jones to prevent it. Jones, to render &s;uch &s;uperiority u&s;ele&s;s, aimed at lying his &s;hip athwart the haw&s;e of the other. Though he did not &s;ucceed to his wi&s;h, yet as the bow&s;prit of the Serapis ran between his poop and mizen ma&s;t, he &s;eized the opportunity of la&s;hing the ve&s;&s;els together, when the wind driving the head of the Serapis again&s;t the bow of the Bon Homme Richard, they became &s;o clo&s;e fore and aft, that the muzzles of their guns muched each others &s;ides. In this po&s;ition they engag|ed from half pa&s;t eight till half pa&s;t ten. But before it commenced, the Bon Homme Richard had received many 18lb. &s;hot between wind and water, and was be|come very leaky. Her tier of 12 pounders was entire|ly &s;ilenced and abandoned. Her &s;ix 18 pounders, which were old, were of no &s;ervice, and were fired but eight times in all. During the &s;ucceeding action, Jones made u&s;e only of three nine pounders, who&s;e fire was &s;econd|ed by that of his men in the round tops. At the &s;ame time others threw &s;uch a quantity and variety of com|bu&s;tible matters into the decks, chains, and every part of the Serapis, that &s;he was on fire not le&s;s than 10 or 12 times in different parts, and it was with the greate&s;t difficulty that the &s;ame could be extingui&s;hed. At half pa&s;t nine, by &s;ome accident, the Serapis had a cartridge of powder &s;et on fire, the flames of which communi|cating from one to another all the way aft, blew up all the people and officers abaft the main ma&s;t, and ren|dered all tho&s;e guns u&s;ele&s;s for the remainder of the action. When both &s;hips were on fire together, as it
<PB N="272" REF="028963_0310_0FDE9EC0103D8438">happened at times, the &s;pectacle was dreadful beyc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d expre&s;&s;ion. The Alliance repeatedly &s;ailed round both while engaged, raking the Serapis fore and aft, and thereby killing or wounding many of her men on the quarter and main decks.&mdash;After ten &s;he came up afre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and renewed the fire; but through the darkne&s;s of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> night, and both &s;hips being &s;o clo&s;e along &s;ide each oth|er, it was not poured into the Serapis alone, but al&s;o i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the Bon Homme Richard, eleven of who&s;e men were killed, be&s;ide an officer mortally wounded, by one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> her broad&s;ides. Captain Pear&s;on however, perceiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> that it was impracticable to &s;tand out any longer with the lea&s;t pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, &s;truck, after having (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> his conduct and per&s;evering bravery) &s;ecured to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> convoy the opportunity of &s;aving them&s;elves. The Serapis was a much &s;uperior &s;hip to the Bon Homme Richard, being built on an excellent model, and carry|ing 44 guns in two tiers, the lower 18 pounders. The number of men killed and wounded on each &s;ide was nece&s;&s;arily great. Both &s;hips &s;uffered much: but the Bon Homme Richard was reduced to a wreck; &s;he had near &s;even feet water in her hold, which kept in|crea&s;ing. The wounded were removed, and only the fir&s;t lieutenant of the Pallas, with &s;ome men, left <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> board to keep the pumps going, while the boats w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> di&s;po&s;ed within call to take them in when occa&s;ion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|quired. On the 25th the water ro&s;e to her lower deck and &s;he went down; but nobody was lo&s;t with her. It &s;till remains to be mentioned, that the Counte&s;s of Scarborough engaged the Pallas for near two hours, when captain Piercy was obliged to &s;trike.

<P>In this and in the following year, 1780, there were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a number of combats of a &s;imilar nature, be|tween the Briti&s;h and French, in which &s;uch in&s;tances <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> profe&s;&s;ional &s;kill, courage and dexterity, were con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ually di&s;played by the latter, as had never before ap|yeared in the marine of that nation.</P>
<P>In the beginning of this &s;ummer the Briti&s;h hou&s;e of commons formed it&s;elf into a committee of inquiry into the American war. Lord Howe and general Howe, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ung by the charges made again&s;t their characters in the public papers, in&s;i&s;ted on an inquiry into the con|dect of the war, as far as they them&s;elves were con|ceived. The mini&s;try &s;trongly oppo&s;ed this, for a va|riety of rea&s;ons; one of which was, that government had laid no charge again&s;t the noble brothers; on the contrary, &s;everal parts of their conduct had met with its approbation. The only part of this inquiry, nece&s;|&s;ity to be taken notice of here, relates to the northern expedition, and the &s;trange evidence given by general Robert&s;on and Mr. Galloway, again&s;t lord and &s;ir William Howe.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of general Burgoyne, by the conven|tion of Saratoga, had been laid down as an in&s;uperable
<PB N="274" REF="028963_0311_0FDE9EC198E16E38">ob&s;tacle again&s;t any inve&s;tigation of his conduct. His continual importunity had given offence, as well as his joining the oppo&s;ition in condemning the conduct of mini&s;try; &s;o that it was probable he would have re|mained in the mo&s;t humiliating circum&s;tances of di&s;|grace, had it not been that the northern expedition w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;o connected in its con&s;equences with the operations of the grand army, that they could not be &s;eparated in the cour&s;e of the inquiry concerning general Howe's con|duct. The 20th of May being fixed upon for entering upon the inquiry, the following officers attended, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Sir Guy Carleton, earl Balcarras, captain Money, act|ing quarter ma&s;ter general; earl of Harrington; major Forbes; captain Bloomfield of the artillery; and lieu|tenant colonel King&s;ton, adjutant general; all of whom governour Carleton excepted, were pre&s;ent during the whole campaign, and eminently partook of the di&s;tre&s;|es and di&s;a&s;ters attending the northern expedition.</P>
<P>From the unanimous te&s;timony of the&s;e very re&s;pect|able witne&s;&s;es, it appeared, that general Burgoyne po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed the confidence and affection of his army, in &s;o extraordinary a degree, that no lo&s;s or misfortune could &s;hake the one, nor di&s;tre&s;s or affliction weaken the oth|er. It e&s;tabli&s;hed an in&s;tance, as far as it could be con|clu&s;ive, and a clo&s;e cro&s;s-examination was unable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> weaken it, perhaps unequalled in military hi&s;tory, that during &s;o long and continued a &s;cene of uncea&s;ing fa|tigue, hard&s;hip, danger, and di&s;tre&s;s, finally ending is general ruin and captivity, not a &s;ingle voice was heart through the whole army, to upbraid, cen&s;ure, or blame the general; and that, even at la&s;t, when every effort was found ineffectual, they were &s;till willing to peri&s;h along with him. By this evidence al&s;o, every cen&s;ure or charge which had been laid again&s;t the commander, was totally overthrown or removed; leaving, however, the que&s;tion open, whether the general's orders for
<PB N="275" REF="028963_0311_0FDE9EC198E16E38">proceeding to Albany were peremptory or conditional; and leaving likewi&s;e &s;ome doubts behind, both with re|&s;pect to the de&s;ign and mode of conducting the expe|dition, under the command of colonel Baume, to Ben|nington. However, it particularly detected two fal&s;e|hoods, which till that time had been in full credit; the one that general Phillips, with a &s;pecified part of the army, had offered at the time of the convention, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ce his way through the enemy from Saratoga back <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Ticonderoga, and the other that the late general Fra&s;er had highly di&s;approved of the mea&s;ure of pa&s;&s;ing Hud&s;on's River. The witne&s;&s;es, on the contrary, were of opinion, that nothing le&s;s than the pa&s;&s;ing of that river and advancing to fight the enemy, could have &s;at|ified the army, or pre&s;erved the general's character with it; and after all the misfortunes that had happen|ed, it was &s;till univer&s;ally con&s;idered as a matter of ab|&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, and to have done otherwi&s;e would have been accounted an unpardonable failure. Their te&s;ti|mony went likewi&s;e to the total &s;ubver&s;ion of that in|jurious report, relative to the &s;uppo&s;ed natural deficien|cy of &s;pirit which by &s;ome was attributed to the A|mericans. On the contrary, they declared freely, that the Americans &s;hewed a re&s;olution, per&s;everance, and even ob&s;tinacy in action, which rendered them by no means unworthy of a conte&s;t with the brave troops who oppo&s;ed them. Written evidence was al&s;o produced and &s;upported, that the number of the American army, at the time of the &s;urrender, amounted to 19,000 men, of which 13,000 or 14,000 were men actually carry|ing mu&s;kets.</P>
<P>The examination of general Burgoyne's witne&s;&s;es was followed by the counter evidence of the American mini&s;ter, again&s;t that brought by lord and &s;ir William Howe. General Robert&s;on and Mr. Galloway were the only witne&s;&s;es examined. The latter had been an
<PB N="276" REF="028963_0312_0FDE9ECA21A1F858">American lawyer, and a member of the fir&s;t congre&s;s; and one of tho&s;e that had come over to &s;ir William Howe when the American cau&s;e &s;eemed nearly ruined. The general had immediately afforded him a liberal provi&s;ion, in expectation of his future &s;ervices, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> which, however, he had been di&s;appointed. He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> be&s;ides, advanced him to &s;everal lucrative as well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> honourable civil employments.</P>
<P>The tendency of this new evidence was, in gentry to overthrow that which had been already given in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> vour of the two commanders. General Robert&s;on rated the number of tho&s;e who were well affected <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Briti&s;h government at three fourths, and Mr. Gal|loway at four fifths of the whole inhabitants of the continent. They &s;aid that if a proper u&s;e had been made of this favourable di&s;po&s;ition of the multitude, a might have been directed to &s;uch e&s;&s;ential purpo&s;es <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> would have brought the war to a &s;peedy and happy conclu&s;ion&mdash;That the force &s;ent out from Britain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> fully &s;ufficient to have reduced the colonies&mdash;That the country of America was not in its nature particularly &s;trong, much le&s;s impracticable, with re&s;pect to milita|ry operations&mdash;That the face of a country being cover|ed with wood, afforded no impediment to the march <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> an army in as many columns as they plea&s;ed&mdash;That the Briti&s;h troops po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a greater &s;uperiority over the Americans in their own favourite mode of bu&s;h-fight|ing, and the detached &s;ervice in woods, than in any other whatever&mdash;That armies might carry 19 days pro|vi&s;ions on their backs, and con&s;equently need not be deterred from the undertaking of expeditions, through the want of tho&s;e means which have been hitherto reckoned indi&s;pen&s;able, &amp;c.</P>
<P>On this, the oppo&s;ition from time to time remarked, that the greater part of tho&s;e gentlemen's te&s;timony was founded upon hear&s;ay intelligence, and violent a&s;|&s;ertions
<PB N="277" REF="028963_0312_0FDE9ECA21A1F858">of facts, not only un&s;upported by collateral evidence, but what &s;carce any body could believe. It was al&s;o remarked, that the only officer produced had been very little, if at all, out of the Briti&s;h garri&s;ons, &s;ince the commencement of the war, and was therefore little qualified, either to give &s;atisfactory information relative to the di&s;po&s;ition of the people with whom he was &s;o little conver&s;ant, or to give a critical opinion of military mea&s;ures he had never &s;een. With regard to Mr. Galloway, they &s;aid, that it was very &s;ingular, that, though bred a lawyer, and habituated to bu&s;ine&s;s, he could &s;carcely be brought to recollect any part of his own conduct in the mo&s;t trying, &s;ignal, and po&s;&s;ibly dangerous &s;ituation of his life, and the mo&s;t con&s;picu|ous &s;phere of action to which he had ever been exalted, namely, when he was a member of the congre&s;s; and yet, that the &s;ame per&s;on, a total &s;tranger to the pro|fe&s;&s;ion, and only flying for refuge to the Briti&s;h army, &s;hould all at once acquire an accuracy in military de|tails, and the complicated bu&s;ine&s;s of a camp, which could &s;carcely be expected from a quarter ma&s;ter gen|eral; and as &s;uddenly become po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, along with the minut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, of that nice di&s;cernment and critical judgment in the general conduct and all the great operations of war, which the olde&s;t and mo&s;t experienced command|ers do not often pretend to.</P>
<P>The foregoing evidence, given in at the bar of the Hou&s;e of Commons of Great Britain, may &s;erve as a &s;ample of the information &s;ent to the Briti&s;h mini&s;try, by their adherents on this &s;ide the Atlantic; upon which they were weak enough to form all their plans for the &s;ubjugation of America.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE beginning of the year 1780 pre&s;ented a mo&s;t alarming appearance to Britain. Advantage was taken of her peculiar circum&s;tances, by the mo&s;t
<PB N="279" REF="028963_0313_0FDE9ECF8FABFA68">&s;agacious among the Iri&s;h, for the obtaining of tho&s;e privileges which might otherwi&s;e never have been &s;e|cured. The doctrines of taxation without repre&s;enta|tion, and of unconditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, which mini&s;try applied to America, were urged as matter of apprehen|&s;ion to Ireland; and it was openly &s;aid that the chains <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> for the former, in ca&s;e of &s;ucce&s;s, would afford a mode for the &s;etters which would &s;oon be fitted for the latter. Being alarmed with the danger of a French i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iu&s;ion, it was urged, that the defence of the king|dom ought to he placed in tho&s;e who had the be&s;t in|tere&s;t in it. Military a&s;&s;ociations were propo&s;ed and univer&s;ally adopted. In every part of the kingdom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;een to ari&s;e, as if by magic, va&s;t bodies of citi|zen, &s;erving at their own charges, choo&s;ing their own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ers, trained to great expertne&s;s, and obeying with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">able regularity. All this bu&s;ine&s;s was accom|pli&s;hed without any &s;ort of confu&s;ion or di&s;order; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the peace of the country, and obedience to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, were never more prevalent. All ranks &s;ell in with the prevailing di&s;po&s;ition. The volunteers were admirably appointed, and amounted to above 50,000 in number. Government &s;aw the&s;e proceedings with a&s;toni&s;hment. They wi&s;hed to regulate this new and unexpected force, and to bring it to act under the au|thority of the crown; but after a few feeble attempts, it was thought be&s;t to concur in a mea&s;ure that could not be prevented. In a word, within the two follow|ing years, Ireland obtained a free trade, and was ac|knowledged to be in&s;eparably annexed to the crown of Great Britain, but independent of its legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t Great Britain was endeavouring to allay the di&s;contents of Ireland, and engaged in a war, not only with her revolted colonies, but with the powerful king|doms of France and Spain, &s;uch a combination was entered into by the neutral powers, under the title of
<PB N="280" REF="028963_0314_0FDE9ED113C6B2C8">an <HI>Armed Neutrality,</HI> as indicated a general di&s;po&s;ition to take up arms in favour of America, &s;hould the e&s;|tabli&s;hment of her independence vet remain doubtful. This extraordinary a&s;&s;ociation originated with the court of Peter&s;burgh, whom the Briti&s;h mini&s;try looked upon as one of their be&s;t allies in the pre&s;ent cri&s;is.</P>
<P>The principles &s;he had adopted for her conduct were, "That neutral &s;hips &s;hould enjoy a free naviga|tion, even from port to port, and on the coa&s;ts of the belligerent powers. That all effects belonging to the belligerent powers, &s;hould be looked on as free <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;uch neutral &s;hips, with an exception of places actually blocked up or be&s;ieged, and with a promi&s;e that they do not carry to the enemy contraband articles." The&s;e were limited by an explanation, &s;o as to "comprehend only warlike &s;tores and ammunition." Her imperial maje&s;ty declared that "&s;he was fully re&s;olved to main|tain the&s;e principles, and that with the view of pro|tecting the commerce and navigation of her &s;ubjects, &s;he had given orders to fit out a con&s;iderable part of her naval force."</P>
<P>The declaration of the empre&s;s on this occa&s;ion would, in other circum&s;tances, have been con&s;idered as a declaration of war. At pre&s;ent, however, the court of London, &s;tanding alone and un&s;upported, was obliged to &s;ubmit. The propo&s;als of the empre&s;s were acceded to not only without the lea&s;t he&s;itation, but with the utmo&s;t applau&s;e of her ju&s;tice and wi&s;dom, by all the other powers of Europe to whom they were pre&s;ented, Portugal alone excepted.</P>
<P>Though the powerful combination in favour of the Americans, of which this armed neutrality might be con&s;idered as a principal part, rendered the conte&s;t with them ultimately hopele&s;s on the part of Great Britain, the war was neverthele&s;s kept up with equal
<PB N="281" REF="028963_0314_0FDE9ED113C6B2C8">&s;pirit by her commanders, and the &s;ame delu&s;ive hopes of &s;ucce&s;s were held out by her mini&s;try.</P>
<P>Accordingly the conque&s;t of the &s;outhern colonies was now looked upon as an object within reach, and for this purpo&s;e an expedition was undertaken by &s;ir Henry Canton and admiral Arbuthnot, for which the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ate of general Wa&s;hington's army was peculiarly fa|vourable. His auxiliaries had already left him; the term of inli&s;tment of a great number of continental &s;oldiers was expired; and the filling up of the regi|ments, by waiting for recruits from their re&s;pective &s;tates, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be a work of con&s;iderable time. The expedition, however, was not undertake<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> till the 26th of December, 1779. They had a very tedious voyage; the weather was uncommonly bad; &s;everal of the tran&s;ports were lo&s;t, as were al&s;o the greater part of the hor&s;es which they carried with them, in|tended for cavalry or other public u&s;es; and an ord|nance &s;hip likewi&s;e foundered at &s;ea. Having arrived at Savannah, in the end of January 1780, they endeav|oured to repair the damages &s;u&s;tained on their voyage,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Feb.</HI> 10.</NOTE> and proceeded from thence on the 10th of February, to North Edi&s;to, the place of debarkation which had been previou&s;ly ap|pointed. They had a favourable and &s;peedy pa&s;&s;age thither: and though it required time to have the bar explored and the channel marked, the tran&s;ports all entered the harbour the next day; and the army took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of St. John's i&s;land, about 30 miles from Charle&s;ton, without oppo&s;ition. Preparations were then made for pa&s;&s;ing the &s;quadron over Charle&s;ton bar, where the high water &s;pring tides were only 19 feet deep: but no opportunity offered of going into the harbour till the 20th of March,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>March</HI> 20.</NOTE> when it was effected without any accident, though the American gallies continually at|tempted
<PB N="282" REF="028963_0315_0FDE9ED298A612E8">to prevent the boats from &s;ounding the chan|nel. The Briti&s;h troops had previou&s;ly removed from John's to James's i&s;land; and on the 29th of the &s;ame month they effected their landing on Charle&s;|ton neck.
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>April</HI> 1.</NOTE> On the 1&s;t of April they broke ground within 800 yards of the American works; and by the 8th the be&s;iegers' guns were mount|ed in battery.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the army began to erect their batteries again&s;t the town, admiral Arbuthnot embraced the fir&s;t favourable opportunity of pa&s;&s;ing Sullivan's i&s;land, upon which there was a &s;trong fort of batteries, the chief defence of the harbour. He weighed on the 9th, with the Roebuck, Richmond, and Romulus, blonde, Virginia, Raleigh, and Sandwich armed &s;hip, the Renown bringing up the rear; and, pa&s;&s;ing through a &s;evere fire, anchored in about two hours under James's i&s;land, with the lo&s;s of 27 &s;eamen killed and wounded. The Richmond's fore topma&s;t was &s;hot away, and the &s;hips in general &s;u&s;tained damage in their ma&s;ts and rigging, though not materially in their hulls. But the Acetus tran&s;port, having on board &s;ome naval &s;tores, grounded within gun &s;hot of Sulli|van's i&s;land and received &s;o much damage that &s;he was obliged to be abandoned and burnt.</P>
<P>On the 10th, &s;ir Henry Clinton and ad|miral Arbuthnot &s;ummoned the town to &s;urrender to his maje&s;ty's arms;
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>April</HI> 10.</NOTE> but major general Lincoln, who commanded in Charle&s;ton, re|turned them an an&s;wer, declaring it to be his intention to defend the place. The batteries were now opened again&s;t the town; and from their effect the fire of the American advanced works con&s;iderably abated. It ap|pears that the number of troops under the command of Lincoln were by far too few for defending works of &s;uch extent as tho&s;e of Charle&s;ton; and that many of
<PB N="283" REF="028963_0315_0FDE9ED298A612E8">the&s;e were men little accu&s;tomed to military &s;ervice, and very ill provided with clothes and other nece&s;&s;a|ries. Lincoln had been for &s;ome time expecting rein|forcements and &s;upplies from Virginia and other places: but they came in very &s;lowly. Earl Cornwallis, and lieutenant colonel Tarleton under him, were al&s;o ex|tremely active in intercepting &s;uch reinforcements and &s;upplies as were &s;ent to the American general. They totally defeated a con&s;iderable body of cavalry and mi|litia which was proceeding to the relief of the town; and al&s;o made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of &s;ome po&s;ts which gave them in a great degree the command of the coun|try, by which means great &s;upplies of provi&s;ions fell into their hands.</P>
<P>Such was the &s;tate of things, and Fort Sullivan had al&s;o been taken by the king's troops, when on the 11th of May general Clinton again &s;ummoned the town to &s;urrender;
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>May</HI> 11.</NOTE> an offer being made, as had been done before, that if they &s;ur|rendered, the lives and property of the inhabitants &s;hould be pre&s;erved to them. Articles of capitulation were then propo&s;ed by general Lincoln; but the terms were not agreed to by general Clinton. At length, however, the town being clo&s;ely inve&s;ted on all &s;ides, and the preparations to &s;torm it in every part being in great forwardne&s;s, and the &s;hips ready to move to the a&s;&s;ault, general Lincoln, who had been applied to for that purpo&s;e by the inhabitants, &s;urrendered it on &s;uch articles of capitulation as general Clinton had before agreed to. This was on the 12th of May, which was one month and two days after the town had been fir&s;t &s;ummoned to &s;urrender.</P>
<P>By the articles of capitulation, the garri&s;on was to march out of town, and to depo&s;it their arms in front of the works, but the drums were not to beat a Briti&s;h march, nor the colours to be unca&s;ed. The continen|tal
<PB N="284" REF="028963_0316_0FDE9EDDCB34B6A0">troops and &s;eamen were to keep their baggage, and remain pri&s;oners of war till exchanged. The militia and inhabitants of all conditions were to be con&s;idered as pri&s;oners on parole, and while they adhered to their parole, were not to be mole&s;ted in per&s;on or property. The militia were permitted to return to their re&s;pec|tive homes. The officers of the army and navy were to retain their &s;ervants, &s;words, pi&s;tols, and baggage un&s;earched. They were permitted to &s;ell their hor&s;es, but not to remove them: and a ve&s;&s;el was allowed to proceed to Philadelphia with general Lincoln's di&s;|patches unopened.</P>
<P>According to &s;ir Henry Clinton's account, the num|ber of pri&s;oners taken in Charle&s;ton amounted to 5600 men, be&s;ides nearly a thou&s;and &s;ailors in arms; but ac|cording to general Lincoln's account tran&s;mitted to the congre&s;s, the whole number of continental troops taken pri&s;oners amounted to no more than 2487. The re|mainder, therefore, included in general Clinton's ac|count, mu&s;t have con&s;i&s;ted of militia and inhabitants of the town. The captive officers were much more in proportion than the privates, and con&s;i&s;ted of 1 major general, 6 brigadiers, 9 colonels, 14 lieutenant colo|nels, 15 majors, 84 captains, 84 lieutenants, 32 &s;ec|ond lieutenants and en&s;igns. Upwards of 400 pieces of artillery, together with arms and ammunition, were found in Charle&s;ton. Several American frigates were al&s;o taken or de&s;troyed in the harbour.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of Charle&s;ton evidently excited a con&s;ider|able alarm in America: and &s;everal popular writers, particularly the author of the celebrated performance entitled Common Sen&s;e, in &s;ome other pieces made u&s;e of it as a powerful argument to lead them to more vigorous exertions again&s;t Great Britain, that they might the more effectually and certainly &s;ecure their independence.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="028963_0316_0FDE9EDDCB34B6A0">
Whil&s;t &s;ir Henry Clinton was employed in his voy|age to Charle&s;ton, and in the &s;iege of that place, the garri&s;on at New York &s;eem not to have been wholly free from apprehen&s;ions for their own &s;afety. An in|ten&s;e fro&s;t, accompanied with great falls of &s;now, began about the middle of December 1779, and &s;hut up the navigation of the port of New York from the &s;ea, within a few days after the departure of admiral Ar|buthnot and general Clinton. The &s;everity of the weather increa&s;ed to &s;o great a degree, that towards the middle of January all communications with New York by water were entirely cut off, and as many new ones opened by the ice. The inhabitants could &s;carce|ly be &s;aid to be in an in&s;ular &s;tate. Hor&s;es with heavy carriages could go over the ice into the Jer&s;ies from one i&s;land to another. The pa&s;&s;age on the North Riv|er, even in the wide&s;t part from New York to Paulus Hook, which was 2000 yards, was about the 19th of January practicable for the heavie&s;t cannon: an event which had been unknown in the memory of man. Provi&s;ions were &s;oon after tran&s;ported upon &s;ledges, and a detachment of cavalry marched upon the ice from New York to Staten I&s;land, which was a di&s;tance of 11 miles.</P>
<P>The city of New York being thus circum&s;tanced, was con&s;idered as much expo&s;ed to the attacks from the continental troops: and it was &s;trongly reported that general Wa&s;hington was meditating a great &s;troke upon New York with his whole force, by different attacks. Some time before this, major general Patti|&s;on, commandant at New York, having received an ad|dre&s;s from many of the inhabitants, offering to put them&s;elves in military array, he thought the pre&s;ent a favourable opportunity of trying the &s;incerity of their profe&s;&s;ions. Accordingly he i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, calling upon all the male inhabitants from 16 to 60 to
<PB N="286" REF="028963_0317_0FDE9EE00E6E9480">take up arms. The requi&s;ition was &s;o readily complied with, that in a few days 40 companies from the &s;ix wards of the city were enrolled, officered, and under arms, to the number of 2600, many &s;ub&s;tantial citi|zens &s;erving in the ranks of each company. Other volunteer companies were formed; and the city was put into a very &s;trong po&s;ture of defence.</P>
<P>No attack, however, was made upon New York, whatever de&s;ign might originally have been meditated; but an attempt was made upon Staten I&s;land, where there were about 1800 men, under the command of brigadier general Sterling, who were well intrenched. General Wa&s;hington, who&s;e army was hutted at Mor|ris Town, &s;ent a detachment of 2700 men, with &s;ix pieces of cannon, two mortars, and &s;ome hor&s;es, com|manded by lord Sterling, who arrived at Staten I&s;land early in the morning of the 15th of January. The advanced po&s;ts of the Briti&s;h troops retired upon the approach of the Americans, who formed the line, and made &s;ome movements in the cour&s;e of the day; but they withdrew in the night, after having burnt one hou&s;e, pillaged &s;ome others, and carried off with them about 200 head of cattle. Immediately on the arrival of the Americans on Staten I&s;land, lieutenant general Knyphau&s;en had embarked 600 men to attempt a pa&s;|&s;age, and to &s;upport general Sterling; but the floating ice compelled them to return. It is, however, imag|ined, that the appearance of the&s;e tran&s;ports, with the Briti&s;h troops on board, which the Americans could &s;ee towards the clo&s;e of the day, induced the latter to make &s;o precipitate a retreat.</P>
<P>In the mean time the ravages of war did not prevent the Americans from paying &s;ome attention to the arts of peace. On the 4th of May an act was pa&s;&s;ed by the council and hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives of Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts Bay for incorporating and e&s;tabli&s;hing a &s;ociety
<PB N="287" REF="028963_0317_0FDE9EE00E6E9480">for promoting the knowledge of the antiquities of America, and of the national hi&s;tory of the country; for determining the u&s;es to which its various natural productions might be applied, for encouraging medici|nal di&s;coveries; mathematical di&s;qui&s;itions; philo&s;oph|ical inquiries and xperiments; a&s;tronomical, meteoro|logical, and geographical ob&s;ervations; improvements in agriculture, manufactures, and commerce; and in &s;hort, for cultivating every art and &s;cience which may tend to advance the intere&s;t, honour, dignity, and hap|pine&s;s of a free, independent, and virtuous people.</P>
<P>Some doubts having ari&s;en in the congre&s;s, towards <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he clo&s;e of the preceding year, about the propriety of their a&s;&s;embling in the city of Philadelphia, it was now re&s;olved that they &s;hould continue to meet there: and a committee of three members was appointed, to report a proper place where buildings might be provided for the reception of the congre&s;s, together with an e&s;timate of the expen&s;e of providing &s;uch buildings, and the nec|e&s;&s;ary offices for the &s;everal boards. It was al&s;o re&s;olv|ed by the congre&s;s, that a monument &s;hould be erected to the memory of their late general Richard Montgom|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ry, who fell at Quebeck, in te&s;timony of his &s;ignal and important &s;ervices to the United States of America, with an in&s;cription expre&s;&s;ive of his amiable character and heroic achievements; and that the continental trea&s;|mers &s;hould be directed to advance a &s;um not exceeding &pound;.300 to Dr. Franklin to defray the expen&s;e; that gentleman being de&s;ired to cau&s;e the monument to be executed at Paris, or in &s;ome other part of France. It was likewi&s;e re&s;olved by the congre&s;s, that a court &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed for the trial of all appeals from the court of admiralty of the United States of America, in ca&s;es of capture; to con&s;i&s;t of three judges, appointed and commi&s;&s;ioned by congre&s;s, and who were to take an

<P>The difficulties of the congre&s;s and of the people of America had been greatly increa&s;ed by the deprecia|tion of their paper currency.

<P>Sir Henry Clinton met with the mo&s;t rapid &s;ucce&s;s every where in Carolina, after the reduction of Charle&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">. Lord Cornwallis, whil&s;t he marched up the north &s;ide of the river Santee, received intelligence that there were &s;ome Virginian troops, under the command of colonel Buford, near the borders of South Carolina. He therefore detached colonel Tarleton with 700 light cavalry, and a new corps of infantry called the Legion, mounted on hor&s;eback, in order to rout and di&s;per&s;e that body, before it could receive any reinforcement from the neighbouring colonies. The Americans, confiding in their di&s;tance from the enemy, had been at no pains to choo&s;e a proper &s;ituation. Col|onel Tarleton, having marched 105 miles in 54 hours, pre&s;ented him&s;elf &s;uddenly and unexpectedly before them at a place called Wax&s;au.
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>May</HI> 29.</NOTE> But although they were &s;urpri&s;ed and di&s;|pirited,
<PB N="290" REF="028963_0319_0FDE9EE4261A7888">they po&s;itively refu&s;ed the offer of the Briti&s;h commander to &s;urrender on the &s;ame terms with the garri&s;on of Charle&s;ton. An engagement therefore en|&s;ued, in which the provincials, though &s;uperior in number, made but a faint defence; above 100 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> killed on the &s;pot, and 150 &s;o badly wounded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> they were unable to travel, and about 50 were brought away pri&s;oners.

This action is vatio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> related. Doctor Gordon ob&s;erves, in his hi&s;tory, that, whil&s;t the flags were pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing concerning a &s;urrender, "Tarleton kept his men in motion, and when the truce was ended, had nearly &s;urrounded his adver&s;aries." The continental party made but a &s;ta|ble re&s;i&s;tance, "and &s;oon begged quarter. A few, however, continued to fire. The Briti&s;h cavalry ad|vanced, but were not oppo&s;ed by the main body of the continentais, who conceived them&s;elves precluded by their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The <HI>accidental</HI> firing of a few was an argument, however, for directing the Briti&s;h legion to charge tho&s;e who had laid down their arms. In con&s;e|quence of this order, the unre&s;i&s;ting Americans, pray|ing for quarters, were chopped in pieces."</P>
<P>Whatever may have been the attending circum|&s;tances of this action, &s;ir Henry Clinton conceived it as entirely deci&s;ive of the fate of South Carolina.</P>
<P>Accordingly he i&s;&s;ued two proclamations, and al&s;o circulated a hand-bill among&s;t the inhabitants of South Carolina, in order to induce them to return to their al|legiance, and to be ready to join the king's troops. It was &s;aid, that the helping hand of every man was want|ed to re-e&s;tabli&s;h peace and good government: and that as the commander in chief wi&s;hed not to draw the king's friends into danger, whil&s;t any doubt could remain of their &s;ucce&s;s; &s;o, now, that this was certain,
<PB N="291" REF="028963_0319_0FDE9EE4261A7888">he tru&s;ted that one and all would heartily join, and by a general concurrence give effect to &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures for that purpo&s;e as from time to time might be pointed out. Tho&s;e who had families were to form a militia to remain at home, and occa&s;ionally to a&s;&s;emble in their own di&s;tricts, when required, under officers of their own choo&s;ing, for the maintenance of peace and good order. Tho&s;e who had no families, and who could conveniently be &s;pared for a time, it was pre&s;umed, would cheerfully a&s;&s;i&s;t his maje&s;ty's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oops in driving their oppre&s;&s;ors, acting under the au|thority of congre&s;s, and all the mi&s;eries of war, far from that colony. For this purpo&s;e it was &s;aid to be nece&s;&s;ary that the young men &s;hould be ready to a&s;&s;em|ble when required, and to &s;erve with the king's troops for any &s;ix months of the en&s;uing twelve that might be found requi&s;ite, under proper regulations. They <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ight choo&s;e officers to each company to command them; and were to be allowed, when on &s;ervice, pay, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">munition, and provi&s;ions, in the &s;ame manner as the king's troops. When they joined the army, each man was to be furni&s;hed with a certificate, declaring that he was only engaged to &s;erve as a militia-man for the time &s;pecified; that he was not to be marched be|yond North-Carolina and Georgia; and that, when the time was out, he was freed from all claims what|ever of military &s;ervice, excepting the common and u&s;ual militia-duty where he lived. He would then, it was &s;aid, have paid his debt to his country, and be entitled to enjoy undi&s;turbed that peace, liberty, and property, at home, which he had contributed to &s;ecure. The proclamations and publications of general Clinton appear to have produced &s;ome effect in South Caroli|na; though they probably operated chiefly upon tho&s;e who were before not much inclined to the cau&s;e of American independence. Two hundred and ten of
<PB N="292" REF="028963_0320_0FDE9EEC4E5134F8">the inhabitants of Charle&s;ton &s;igned an addre&s;s to general Clinton and admiral Arbuthnot, &s;oliciting to be re-admitted to the character and condition of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, the inhabitants of that city having been hitherto con&s;idered as pri&s;oners on parole; de|claring their di&s;approbation of the doctrine of Ameri|can independence; and expre&s;&s;ing their regret, that after the repeal of tho&s;e &s;tatutes which gave ri&s;e to the troubles in America, the overtures made by his maj|e&s;ty's commi&s;&s;ioners had not been regarded by the congre&s;s. Sir Henry Clinton, in one of the procla|mations i&s;&s;ued at this time, declared, that if any per|&s;ons &s;hould thenceforward appear in arms in order to prevent the e&s;tabli&s;hment of his maje&s;ty's government in that country, or &s;hould, under any pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ce or au|thority what&s;oever, attempt to compel any other per|&s;on or per&s;ons to do &s;o, or who &s;hould hinder or intim|idate the king's faithful and loyal &s;ubjects from join|ing his forces, or otherwi&s;e performing tho&s;e duties their allegiance required, &s;uch per&s;ons &s;hould be treat|ed with the utmo&s;t &s;everity, and their e&s;tates be imme|diately &s;eized in order to be confi&s;cated.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h commander, amu&s;ing him&s;elf with the&s;e flattering pro&s;pects, thought of returning to New York, to which he was likewi&s;e induced by intelligence he had received that a French fleet commanded by M. de Fernay, with a number of land forces, might &s;oon be expectation the American coa&s;t. He em|barked early in June, leaving lord Cornwallis with about four thou&s;and troops for the &s;outhern &s;ervice. On his return to New York, he acquainted the Amer|ican mini&s;ter that there were very few in the province who were not either pri&s;oners to, or in arms with the Briti&s;h forces; and he exulted in the number of tho&s;e who came in from every quarter to te&s;tify their alle|giance, to offer their &s;ervices in &s;upport of his maje&s;|ty's
<PB N="293" REF="028963_0320_0FDE9EEC4E5134F8">government, and who in many in&s;tances had brought as pri&s;oners their former oppre&s;&s;ors or leaders.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e po&s;itive a&s;&s;ertions, and the flattering appearances of loyalty in South Carolina, at the time of Sir Henry's departure from thence, it &s;oon became obvious, that many of the inhabitants were &s;o little &s;atisfied with their pre&s;ent government, that they endeavoured to di&s;po&s;e of their property on the be&s;t terms they could obtain, and totally to aban|don the country. This conduct became &s;o frequent and glaring, that lord Cor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">allis thought proper to i&s;&s;ue a proclamation, &s;trictly forbidding all &s;ales and transfers of property, including even negroes, without a licen&s;e fir&s;t obtained from the commandant of Charle&s;ton; and likewi&s;e forbidding all ma&s;ters of ve&s;&s;els from carrying any per&s;ons whatever, whether black or white, out of the colony, without a written pa&s;&s;port from the &s;ame officer.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the di&s;advantages under which they laboured, the Americans &s;eemed to entertain no doubts but that they &s;hould be able to maintain their independency. The 4th of July was celebrated this year at Philadelphia with &s;ome pomp, as the anniver&s;ary of American independence. A commencement for conferring degrees in the arts was held the &s;ame day, in the hall of the univer&s;ity there; at which the pre&s;|ident and members of the congre&s;s attended, and other per&s;ons in public offices. The chevalier de la Lu|zerne, mini&s;ter plenipotentiary from the French king to the United States, was al&s;o pre&s;ent on the occa&s;ion. A charge was publickly addre&s;&s;ed by the provo&s;t of the univer&s;ity to the &s;tudents; in which he &s;aid, that he could not but congratulate them "on that au&s;pi|cious day, which, amid&s;t the confu&s;ions and de&s;olations of war, beheld learning beginning to revive; and ani|mated them with the plea&s;ing pro&s;pect of &s;eeing the
<PB N="294" REF="028963_0321_0FDE9EF1488DD5A8">&s;acred lamp of &s;cience burning with a &s;till brighter flame, and &s;cattering its invigorating rays over the unexplored de&s;arts of this exten&s;ive continent; until the whole world &s;hould be involved in the united blaze of knowledge, liberty, and religion. When he &s;tretch|ed his views forward, (he &s;aid) and &s;urveyed the ri&s;ing glories of America, the enriching con&s;equences of their determined &s;truggle for liberty, the exten&s;ive fields of intellectual improvement and u&s;eful invention, in &s;cience and arts, in agriculture and commerce, in religion and government, through which the unfetter|ed mind would range, with increa&s;ing delight, in que&s;t of the undi&s;covered trea&s;ure which yet lay concealed in the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms of the new world; or in the other fertile &s;ources of knowl|edge with which it abounded,&mdash;his heart &s;welled with the plea&s;ing pro&s;pect, that the &s;ons of that in&s;titution would di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves, in the different walks of life, by their literary contributions to the embelli&s;h|ments and increa&s;e of human happine&s;s."</P>
<P>The fir&s;t effort the Americans made in South Car|olina, after the fall of Charle&s;ton, was in the middle of July, when 133 of colonel Sumpter's corps attack|ed and routed a detachment of the royal forces and militia,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>July</HI> 12.</NOTE> which were po&s;ted in a lane at William&s;on's plantation. This was the fir&s;t advantage gained over the Briti&s;h &s;ince their landing in the province, in the beginning of the year. In a few days after, troops joining colonel Sumpter with great al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rity, from the northernmo&s;t frontier, and being now at the head of 600 men, he made a &s;pirited attack on a party of the Briti&s;h at Rocky Mount, but, having no artillery, he was forced to re|treat. This active partizan, &s;en&s;ible that he could not keep the militia together without employing them, at|tacked another royal detachment, con&s;i&s;ting of the
<PB N="295" REF="028963_0321_0FDE9EF1488DD5A8">prince of Wales' regiment, and a large body of tories under colonel Byran, po&s;ted at Hanging Rock, whom he almo&s;t totally de&s;troyed; the above regiment being reduced from 278 men to 9; and the remainder of the loyali&s;ts in that quarter were di&s;per&s;ed.</P>
<P>In the mean time the part of the Briti&s;h army de&s;tin|ed to active &s;ervice was advanced towards the fron|tiers under the command of lord Rawdon, who fixed his head-quarters at the town of Camden. The ad|vantageous &s;ituation of that place on the great river Santee, which afforded an ea&s;y communication with &s;everal remote parts of the country, induced lord Corn|wallis not only to make it a place of arms, but a gen|eral &s;tore hou&s;e or repo&s;itory for the army in its in|tended operations. He likewi&s;e &s;pared no pains in arming and embodying the militia of the province, and in rai&s;ing new military corps, under well affected leaders.</P>
<P>But, during the&s;e tran&s;actions, a great change in the a&s;pect of affairs took place in North Carolina. Be&s;ides the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the loyali&s;ts, who were treated with little mercy, baron de Kalb, a German, long an officer in the French &s;ervice, and now a ma|jor general in the American army, arrived in that province with 2000 continental troops, and was fol|lowed by &s;ome bodies of militia from Virginia. The governours of the &s;tate were likewi&s;e indefatigable in their exertions and preparations, at lea&s;t for defence if not for conque&s;t. Troops were rai&s;ed, and the mi|litia every where drawn out; and be&s;ides colonel Sumpter, Rutherford, Ca&s;well and other leaders, advanced to the frontiers, at the head of different bod|ies. Skirmi&s;hes took place on all &s;ides with various fortune; and the provincials became &s;o &s;trong that lord Rawdon was obliged to contract his po&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="028963_0322_0FDE9EF2CF8B9188">
It &s;oon appeared that &s;ir Henry Clinton's idea of the loyalty of South Carolina was a delu&s;ion; and that nothing could deter the inhabitants from adhering to the cau&s;e of congre&s;s, whenever an opportunity of|fered. The people, tired of the war, had &s;ubmitted to the Briti&s;h government with the expectation of bet|tering their condition, but they &s;oon found their mi&s;|take; the officers, privates, and followers of the roy|al army being more intent upon rai&s;ing their fortunes by plunder, than in acquiring the affections of the people whom they had conquered. Accordingly, as the provincials increa&s;ed in &s;trength, and approached nearer, numbers of tho&s;e who had &s;ubmitted to the Briti&s;h government, and others who were on parole, abandoned and hazarded all things, in order to join them. Colonel Li&s;le, who had exchanged his parcle for a certificate of being a good &s;ubject, carried off a whole battalion of militia, which had been rai&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> another gentleman for lord Cornwallis, to join colonel Sumpter. Another battalion, who were appointed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> conduct about 100 &s;ick down the Pedee to George town, &s;eized their own officers, and carried them with the &s;ick, all pri&s;oners to the provincial camp.</P>
<P>General Gates was now in North Carolina to take the command of the &s;outhern army. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the &s;econd week of Augu&s;t,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Augu&s;t.</HI></NOTE> earl Cornwallis having received intelligence at Charle&s;ton, that Gates was advancing with his army, and that Sumpter was endeavouring to cut off the communica|tion between that city and the army; that the whole country between the Pedee and the Black River had re|volted; and that lord Rawdon was collecting his whole force at Camden&mdash;he immediately &s;et off &s;et that place. On his arrival he had no &s;mall difficulties to encounter. Gates was at hand with a great &s;uperi|ority of force; and the po&s;ition of Camden, conveni|ent
<PB N="297" REF="028963_0322_0FDE9EF2CF8B9188">in other re&s;pects, was a bad &s;ituation for an attack. He could indeed have made good his retreat to Charle&s;ton, but he mu&s;t have left 800 &s;ick men and a va&s;t quantity of valuable &s;tores to fall into the hands of the provincials. He likewi&s;e fore&s;aw, that excepting Charle&s;ton and Savannah, a retreat would occa&s;ion the lo&s;e of the two provinces of Carolina and Georgia. In his own words, there was "little to lo&s;e by a defeat, and much to gain by a victory." The intelligence which he had received that general Gates was encamp|ed in a bad &s;ituation at Clermont about 13 miles from Camden, no doubt con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">irmed his determination. He accordingly marched from Camden about 10 o'clock at night with an intention to &s;urpri&s;e general Gates;
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 15.</NOTE> and making his di&s;po&s;itions in &s;uch a manner, as that his be&s;t troops and greate&s;t force &s;hould be directed again&s;t the con|tinental regiments, laying little &s;tre&s;s on the militia, if the&s;e were &s;ufficiently provided again&s;t.</P>
<P>It was very &s;ingular that the very &s;ame hour at which lord Cornwallis &s;et out from Camden to &s;ur|pri&s;e general Gates, that general, ignorant of Corn|wallis' arrival at Camden, &s;hould &s;et out from Cler|mont to &s;urpri&s;e him. About half an hour after two in the morning,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 16.</NOTE> the ad|vanced parties of both armies met in the woods, and a &s;iring commenced. Some of the cavalry of Armand's legion wounded by the fir&s;t fire of the enemy, threw others into di&s;order, and the whole re|coiled &s;o &s;uddenly, that the fir&s;t Maryland regiment, in the front of the column, was broken, and the whole line of the army thrown into a general con&s;ternation. This fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion &s;truck deep. The light infantry, however, executed their orders; particularly tho&s;e un|der colonel Pottersfield, who behaved with &s;uch &s;pirit, that the enemy was no le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed at this unexpected
<PB N="298" REF="028963_0323_0FDE9EF454CD4970">meeting. A few pri&s;oners were taken on both &s;ides, by who&s;e information the re&s;pective commanders de|rived a knowledge of circum&s;tances, of which both till then were ignorant. Colonel Pottersfield, in who&s;e abilities and activity Gates had placed great dependence, received a mu&s;ket-ball which &s;hattered the bones of his leg, in this fir&s;t encounter. The American army &s;oon recovered its order. Cornwallis al&s;o kept his ground; and frequent &s;kirmi&s;hes en&s;ued, with &s;carcely any oth|er effect than to di&s;cover the &s;ituation of the armies, to evince the intention of the generals, and to &s;erve as a prelude to what was to occur in the morning.</P>
<P>The action began at break of day, in a &s;ituation very advantageous for the Briti&s;h troops, but very unfavour|able to the Americans. The latter were much more numerous; but the ground on which both armies &s;tood was narrowed by &s;wamps on the right and left, &s;o that the Americans could not properly avail them&s;elves of their &s;uperio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> numbers. There &s;eems to have been &s;ome want of general&s;hip in Gates, in &s;uffering him|&s;elf to be &s;urpri&s;ed in &s;o di&s;advantageous a po&s;ition; but this circum&s;tance was the effect of accident, as has been already related.</P>
<P>The attack was made by the Briti&s;h troops with great vigour, and in a few minutes the action was general along the whole line. It was at this time a dead calm, with a little hazine&s;s in the air, which, pre|venting the &s;moke from ri&s;ing, occa&s;ioned &s;o thick a darkne&s;s, that it was difficult to &s;ee the effect of a very heavy and well-&s;upported fire on both &s;ides. The Briti&s;h troops either kept up a con&s;tant fire, or made u&s;e of bayonets, as opportunities offered; and after an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance during three quarters of an hour, threw the Americans into total confu&s;ion, and forced them to give way in all quarters. The conti|nental troops behaved remarkably well, but the militia
<PB N="299" REF="028963_0323_0FDE9EF454CD4970">were &s;oon broken, and left the former to oppo&s;e the whole force of the Briti&s;h troops. General Gates did all in his power to rally the militia, but without effect: the continentals retreated in &s;ome order; but the rout of the militia was &s;o great, that the Briti&s;h cav|alry are &s;aid to have continued the pur&s;uit of them to the di&s;tance of 22 miles from the place where the ac|tion happened. The lo&s;s of the Americans was very con&s;iderable; about 1,000 pri&s;oners were taken, and more are &s;aid to have been killed and wounded, but the number is not very accurately a&s;certained. Eight pieces of bra&s;s cannon, 2,000 &s;tand of arms, a number of colours, and all the ammunition waggons of the Americans, were al&s;o taken. Of the Briti&s;h troops, the killed and wounded amounted to 324. Among the pri&s;oners taken was major general baron de Kalb, who was mortally wounded, having exhibited great gallantry in the cour&s;e of the action, and received 11 wounds. Be&s;ides baron de Kalb, the Americans lo&s;t &s;everal other officers, among whom were brigadier general Gregory killed, and general Rutherford taken. The Briti&s;h troops by which this victory was achieved, did not much exceed 2,000, while the American army is &s;aid to have amounted to 6,000; of which, however, the greate&s;t part was militia.</P>
<P>Lieutenant colonel Tarleton, who had greatly di&s;|tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in this action, was de|tached the following day,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Aug.</HI> 17.</NOTE> with &s;ome cavalry and light infantry, amounting to about 350 men, to attack a corps of Americans under general Sumpter. He executed this &s;ervice with great activity and military addre&s;s. He procured good information of Sumpter's movements; and by forced and concealed marches came up with and &s;urpri&s;ed him in the middle of the day on the 18th, near the Catawba fords. He totally de&s;troyed or di&s;per&s;ed his detachment, which
<PB N="300" REF="028963_0324_0FDE9D9DCDFF7348">con&s;i&s;ted of 700 men, killing 150 on the &s;pot, and tak|ing two pieces of bra&s;s cannon, 300 pri&s;oners, and 44 waggons.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the military operations already related were going on in the &s;outhern colonies, the ho&s;tile armies on the &s;ide of New York were &s;o nearly poi&s;ed that no great exploits could be performed on either &s;ide.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the <HI>refugees</HI> were grown &s;o numerous, that, through &s;ome mi&s;taken p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">y, they were permi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ted to &s;et up a di&s;tinct government in New York un|der the name of "The Honourable Board of A&s;&s;ociat|ed Loyali&s;ts;" and this board was &s;aid to be authori&s;|ed by the Briti&s;h legi&s;lature: But, be it as it will, as the&s;e refugees had a common &s;tock and their infant excur&s;ions at &s;ea proved extremely &s;ucce&s;sful, they be|came every day more powerful, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;omething like a fleet of &s;mall privateers and crui&s;ers. Their knowledge of the adjoining coa&s;ts afforded them &s;uch advantages, that they generally proved &s;ucce&s;sful in their enterpri&s;es; but their want of any kind of di&s;ci|pline or government, along with their peculiar, and frequently per&s;onal animo&s;ity, leading them to exce&s;s, produced retaliation on the other &s;ide, &s;o that the war was carried on with unrelenting cruelty on both &s;ides, without the lea&s;t tendency to conque&s;t or reconcilia|tion.</P>
<P>A few days before the arrival of &s;ir Henry Clinton from Charle&s;ton, the generals Knyphau&s;en, Robert&s;on, and Tryon, pa&s;&s;ed over by night with 5,000 men from Staten I&s;land in New Jer&s;ey,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>June</HI> 6.</NOTE> with a view of attacking &s;ome of general Wa&s;hington's out po&s;ts. On the following morning, though &s;everely hara&s;&s;ed in their march by the militia, they proceeded to Connecticut Farms. This new and thriving &s;ettlement was burnt, together with the Pre&s;|byterian meeting hou&s;e in that place. Whil&s;t the roy|al
<PB N="301" REF="028963_0324_0FDE9D9DCDFF7348">forces were on their way into the country, a &s;oldier went to the hou&s;e of Mr. C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ell, a clergyman, and, in his ab&s;ence, &s;hot his wife in&s;tantly dead, by level|ling his piece directly at her through the window of the room, in which &s;he was &s;itting with her children. This individual act of cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lty, ju&s;tly excited the loud|e&s;t complaint. The detachment next proceeded to Springfield. On approaching the bridge in front of the town, they were farther oppo&s;ed by general Max|well, who, with a few continental troops, di&s;puted their pa&s;&s;age. They halted till midnight, and then re|treated to Elizabeth Town. Before they had retreated, the whole American army at Morris Town marched to oppo&s;e them. Whil&s;t this royal detachment was in Jer&s;ey, &s;ir Henry Clinton had returned to New York, and having &s;ent a reinforcement to Knyphau&s;en, the whole advanced a &s;econd time to Springfield. They were now oppo&s;ed by general Green, with a con&s;idera|ble body of continental troops. Colonel Angel, with 170 men and a piece of artillery, defended the bridge with great gallantry, again&s;t a va&s;t &s;uperiority of force, and though obliged at la&s;t to give way, found means to carry off his wounded, though nearly one fourth of the whole corps were by this time killed or di&s;abled: the Briti&s;h troops having &s;uffered more in this trifling affair than can be imagined.</P>
<P>At this time general Green lay about a mile above Springfield; but his troops were &s;o divided that he could not make any detachment &s;ufficient for the re|lief of colonel Angel, without hazarding the &s;ecurity of the po&s;t he him&s;elf occupied, and which was of much greater importance. The Briti&s;h troops, there|fore, having met with &s;o unexpected a check from the handful of men at the bridge, did not venture to at|tack Green, but clo&s;ed their expedition with burning the town of Springfield. The royal forces then re|treated,
<PB N="302" REF="028963_0325_0FDE9F01CF8F8D10">but were pur&s;ued by the enraged militia till they entered Elizabeth Town, and next day they &s;et out on their return to New York.</P>
<P>The event of this &s;hort campaign in the Jer&s;ies &s;hew|ed, more than any thing that had yet happened, the utter impo&s;&s;ibility of reducing the Americans by force of arms. It was now evident that the Briti&s;h forces, had an enemy in the field little le&s;s re&s;pectable than them&s;elves; and that all the &s;uperiority in arms, which had produced &s;uch effects in the beginning of the co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|te&s;t, was, in a great mea&s;ure at an end; nor did gener|al Wa&s;hington fail to &s;hew the greate&s;t exultation i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the public orders given by him afterwards, on the ef|fects of the improvements in di&s;cipline he had already made, and the greater which he &s;till hoped.</P>
<P>During the cour&s;e of the &s;ummer, the Americans were farther encouraged by the return of the marqui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> de la Fayette from France, whither he had gone &s;ome|time before. His early engagement, his great and un|remitting zeal in the American &s;ervice, in which he held a high rank, and his &s;ucce&s;sful application to the court of France, cau&s;ed him to be received with great di&s;tinction by general Wa&s;hington, who gave him a letter to Congre&s;s full of the mo&s;t flattering en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|miums.</P>

Andre, di&s;daining all &s;ubterfuge and eva&s;ion, and &s;tudying only to place his character in &s;o fair a light, as might prevent its being &s;haded by pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, voluntarily con|fe&s;&s;ed
<PB N="310" REF="028963_0329_0FDDBF98880A6538">more than he was a&s;ked, and &s;ought not to pal|liate any thing relating to him&s;elf, whil&s;t he concealed, with the mo&s;t guarded and &s;crupulous nicety, what|ever might involve others. The board &s;hewed him every po&s;&s;ible mark of indulgence, and &s;ufficiently witne&s;&s;ed how much they felt for his &s;ituation. How|ever, public ju&s;tice obliged them to declare, "that major Andre ought to be con&s;idered as a &s;py from the enemy; and that agreeable to the law and u&s;age of nations, it is their opinion he ought to &s;uffer death."</P>
<P>Several letters pa&s;&s;ed between the generals Clinton and Wa&s;hington relative to this unhappy affair; but nothing was capable of &s;aving the unfortunate Andre. The major was &s;uperior to the terrors of death; but the di&s;graceful mode of dying, which the u&s;age of war had annexed to his unhappy &s;ituation, was infinitely dreadful to him. He was de&s;irous of being indulged with a profe&s;&s;ional death, and had accordingly written the day before, a pathetic letter, fraught with all the feelings of a man of &s;entiment and honour, in which he reque&s;ted of general Wa&s;hington, that he might not die on a gibbet. The general con&s;ulted his officers on the &s;ubject. Pity and e&s;teem wrought &s;o powerful|ly, that they were all for &s;hooting him, till Green in|&s;i&s;ted on it, that his crime was that of a common &s;py; that the public good required his being hanged, and that, were he &s;hot, the generality would think there were favourable circum&s;tances entitling him to notice and lenity. His ob&s;ervations convinced them that it was improper to grant the major's reque&s;t, whil&s;t a &s;im|ilar motive prevented its being divulged.</P>
<P>When major Andre was led out to the place of ex|ecution at Tappan in the &s;tate of New-York, as he went along he bowed him&s;elf familiarly to all tho&s;e with whom he had been acquainted in his confinement. A &s;mile of complacency expre&s;&s;ed the &s;cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne fortitude
<PB N="311" REF="028963_0329_0FDDBF98880A6538">of his mind. Upon &s;eeing the preparations at the fa|tal &s;pot, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a&s;ked with &s;ome emotion, "Mu&s;t I die in this manner?" He was told it was unavoidable. He replied, "I am reconciled to my fate, but not to the mode." Soon after, recollecting him&s;elf, he added, "it will be but a momentary pang;" and, &s;pringing upon the cart, he performed the la&s;t offices to him&s;elf with a compo&s;ure that excited the admiration, and melted the hearts of all the &s;pectators. Being told that the fatal moment was at hand, and a&s;ked if he had any thing to &s;ay, he an&s;wered, "Nothing but to reque&s;t you will witne&s;s to the world, that I die like a brave man." The &s;ucceeding moments clo&s;ed the affecting &s;cene. "Though a regard for the public &s;afety impo&s;ed a nece&s;&s;ity for inflicting the rigours of martial law, yet the rare worth of this unfortunate officer made his unhappy ca&s;e the &s;ubject of univer&s;al regret. Not only among the partizans of royal govern|ment, but among the firme&s;t American republicans, the friendly tear of &s;ympathy freely flowed, for the early fall of this amiable young man. Some con|demned, others ju&s;tified, but all regretted the fatal &s;entence which put a period to his valuable life."</P>
<P>Congre&s;s, in te&s;timony of the high &s;en&s;e entertain|ed of the virtuous and patriotic conduct of John Paulding, David Williams, and I&s;aac Van Verb, the captors of Andre, re&s;olved, "That each of them re|ceive annually two hundred dollars in &s;pecie during life and that the board of war be directed to procure for each of them a &s;ilver medal, on one &s;ide of which &s;hould be a &s;hield with this in&s;cription, <HI>Fidelity,</HI> and on the other, the following motto, <HI>Vincit Amor Patriae;</HI> and that the commander in chief be reque&s;ted to pre|&s;ent the &s;ame, with the thanks of Congre&s;s, for their fidelity and the eminent &s;ervice they had rendered their country."</P>
<P><PB N="312" REF="028963_0330_0FDDBF9F219BA728">
Arnold was made a brigadier general in the king's &s;ervice, and publi&s;hed an addre&s;s to the inhabitants of America, dated from New-York, October 7, in which he endeavoured to ju&s;tify his de&s;ertion of their cau&s;e He &s;aid, that when he fir&s;t engaged in it, he conceived the rights of his country to be in danger, and that duty and honour called him to her defence. A redre&s;s of grievances was his only aim and object; and there|fore he acquie&s;ced unwillingly in the declaration of independence, becau&s;e he thought it precipitate. But the rea&s;ons that then were offered to ju&s;tify that mea&s;ure, no longer could exi&s;t, when Great Britain, with the open arms of a parent, offered to em|brace them as children, and to grant the wi&s;hed for re|dre&s;s. From the refu&s;al of the&s;e propo&s;als, and the ratification of the French alliance, all his ideas of the ju&s;tice and policy of the war were totally changed, and from that time, he had become a profe&s;&s;ed loyali&s;t. He acknowledged that "in the&s;e principles he had on|ly retained his arms and command, for an opportunity to &s;urrender them to Great Britain."</P>
<P>This addre&s;s was &s;oon followed by another, in&s;crib|ed to the officers and &s;oldiers of the continental army. This was intended to induce them to follow his exam|ple, and engage in the royal &s;ervice. He informed them, that he was authori&s;ed to rai&s;e a corps of cavalry and infantry, who were to be on the &s;ame footing with the other troops in the Briti&s;h &s;ervice. To allure the private men, three guineas were offered to each, be|&s;ides payment for their hor&s;es, arms and accoutre|ments. Rank in the Briti&s;h army was al&s;o held out to the American officers, who would recruit and bring in a certain number of men, proportioned to the dif|ferent grades in military &s;ervice. The&s;e offers were propo&s;ed to unpaid &s;oldiers, who were &s;uffering from the want of both food and cloathing, and to officers
<PB N="313" REF="028963_0330_0FDDBF9F219BA728">who were in a great degree obliged to &s;upport them|&s;elves from their own re&s;ources, while they were &s;pending the prime of their days, and ri&s;king their lives in the unproductive &s;ervice of congre&s;s.</P>
<P>Though they were urged at a time when the paper currency was at its lowe&s;t ebb of depreciation, and the wants and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the American army were at their highe&s;t pitch, yet they did not produce the in|tended effect on a &s;ingle &s;entinel or officer. Whether the circum&s;tances of Arnold's ca&s;e added new &s;hades to the crime of de&s;ertion, or whether their providential e&s;cape from the deep laid &s;cheme again&s;t We&s;t Point gave a higher tone to the firmne&s;s of the American &s;oldiery, cannot be unfolded: But either from the&s;e or &s;ome other cau&s;es, de&s;ertion wholly cea&s;ed at this re|markable period of the war.</P>
<P>The Americans, however, accounted for the conduct of Arnold in a different and in a more probable and &s;atisfactory manner. They alleged that he had &s;o in|volved him&s;elf in debts and difficulties by his extrava|gant manner of living in America, that he had ren|dered it very inconvenient for him to continue there: That after the evacuation of Philadelphia by the Brit|i&s;h troops, Arnold, being inve&s;ted with the command in that city, had made the hou&s;e of Mr. Penn, which was the be&s;t in the city, his head-quarters. This he had furni&s;hed in an elegant and expen&s;ive man|ner, and lived in a &s;tyle far beyond his income. It was manife&s;t, they &s;aid, that he could at fir&s;t have no great aver&s;ion to the French alliance, becau&s;e that when M. Gerard, mini&s;ter plenipotentiary from the court of France, arrived at Philadelphia in July 1778, general Arnold early and earne&s;tly &s;olicited that min|i&s;ter, with his whole &s;uite, to take apartments and bed and board at his hou&s;e, until a proper hou&s;e could be provided by the order of the congre&s;s. This offer
<PB N="314" REF="028963_0331_0FDDBFA164F8FF10">M. Gerard accepted, and continued with him &s;ome weeks. The French mini&s;ter re&s;ided upwards of 14 months in Philadelphia; during which time general Arnold kept up the mo&s;t friendly and intimate ac|quaintance with him, and there was a continued in|terchange of dinners, balls, routs and concerts: So that M. Gerard mu&s;t have believed, that in general Arnold he had found and left one of the warme&s;t friends the court of France had in America. He was al&s;o one of the fir&s;t in congratulating the chevalier de la Luzerne, the &s;econd French mini&s;ter. About this time com|plaints and accu&s;ations were exhibited again&s;t him by the government of Philadelphia for divers mal-prac|tices; among which charges were, the appropriation of goods and merchandi&s;e to his own u&s;e, which he had &s;eized as Briti&s;h property in Philadelphia in July, 1778. It was determined by a court-martial that his conduct was highly reprehen&s;ible; but he was indulgently treat|ed, and was therefore only reprimanded by the com|mander in chief, general Wa&s;hington. It was in the&s;e circum&s;tances, the Americans &s;aid, bankrupted in rep|utation and fortune, loaded with debts, and having a growing and expen&s;ive family, that general Arnold fir&s;t turned his thoughts towards joining the royal arms.</P>
<P>Major Talmage, of the light dragoons, planned and executed a gallant enterpri&s;e towards the end of November.
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nov.</HI> 28.</NOTE> He cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ound to Long I&s;land with 80 men, made a cir|cuitous march of 20 miles to Fort George, and reduc|ed it without any other lo&s;s than that of one private man wounded. He killed and wounded eight of the Briti&s;h, captured one lieutenant colonel, one captain, and 55 privates.</P>
<P>During the foregoing tran&s;actions on the &s;ide of New York, lord Cornwallis had been prevented from
<PB N="315" REF="028963_0331_0FDDBFA164F8FF10">making any farther progre&s;s in Carolina for a con&s;ider|able time, by the exce&s;&s;ive heats and unhealthy &s;ea&s;on which followed his victory at Camden. As oppo&s;ition to the Briti&s;h government was &s;till far from being &s;ub|dued, his lord&s;hip, about the middle of September,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sept.</HI> 16.</NOTE> i&s;&s;ued a proclamation "for &s;eque&s;trating the e&s;tates of tho&s;e per|&s;ons within the province, who were either actu|ally in arms, who had abandoned their plantations with a view of joining or &s;upporting the enemy, or who, by an avowal of rebellious principles and other criminal acts &s;hould manife&s;t a de&s;perate per&s;everance in oppo&s;ing the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of his maje&s;ty's gov|ernment." For this purpo&s;e, he appointed a commi&s;|&s;ioner to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch e&s;tates and property, the annual product of which, excepting the part allot|ted for the maintenance of the families of the parties, was to be applied to the public &s;ervice, in contributing towards the expen&s;es of the war.</P>
<P>In the mean time colonel Fergu&s;on had taken great pains to di&s;cipline &s;ome of the tory militia; and with a party of the&s;e, and &s;ome Briti&s;h troops, amounting in the whole to about 1,400 men, unencumbered with baggage or artillery, made incur&s;ions into the northern parts of South Carolina. He de&s;igned to join lord Cornwallis at Charlotte. Fergu&s;on was tempted to &s;tay near to the we&s;tern mountains longer than was nece&s;&s;ary, under the hope of cutting off Clark in his retreat from Georgia. This delay gave an opportunity for the junction of &s;everal corps of militia, which prov|ed his ruin. Colonel Williams of Ninety Six pur&s;ued him with 450 hor&s;e. The inhabitants about the we&s;tern waters, north of North Carolina, and we&s;t of the Alleghany and Virginia, though not called upon to embody under any common authority, voluntarily mu&s;tered under their re&s;pective colonels, and being all mounted, and unencumbered with baggage, their
<PB N="316" REF="028963_0332_0FDDBFA29F1D4178">motions were rapid. When they all joined at Gilbert Town, under the command of colonels Campbell, Cleve|land, Shelby, and Sevier, they amounted to near 3,000. They &s;oon found out Fergu&s;on's encampment, which was on an eminence of a circular ba&s;e, called King's Mountain, &s;ituated near the confines of North and South Carolina. About 1,000 of their be&s;t men, mounted on their fleete&s;t hor&s;es, came up with Fer|gu&s;on on the 7th of October, under the conduct of colonel Campbell. As they approached the royal en|campment, they divided their force. Some a&s;cended the mountain, whil&s;t others went round its ba&s;e in oppo&s;ite directions. The firing began about four o'clock in the afternoon. The picket gave way, and were pur&s;ued as they retired up the mountain to the main body. Fergu&s;on, with the greate&s;t bravery, or|dered his men to the charge. The Americans retired from the approaching bayonet. Soon after the&s;e had retreated, Shelby with the other detachment, having completed the de&s;igned circuit, opportunely arrived, and from an unexpected quarter poured in a well di|rected fire. Fergu&s;on de&s;i&s;ted from the pur&s;uit, and engaged his new adver&s;aries. The Briti&s;h bayonet was again &s;ucce&s;sful, and cau&s;ed them al&s;o to fall back. By this time the party commanded by Campbell a&s;|cended the mountain, and renewed the attack from that eminence. Fergu&s;on pre&s;ented a new front, and was again &s;ucce&s;sful; but all his exertions were unavailing. The a&s;&s;ailants retired only a little way, and, getting behind trees and rocks, renewed their &s;ire. And as often as one of the American parties was driven back, another returned to its &s;tation. Major Fergu&s;on di&s;|played as much bravery as was po&s;&s;ible in his &s;ituation, but his unconquerable &s;pirit di&s;dained either to flee or &s;urrender. However, after having repul&s;ed a &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion of adver&s;aries, pouring in their &s;ire from new di|rections,
<PB N="317" REF="028963_0332_0FDDBFA29F1D4178">this officer received a mortal wound. No chance of e&s;cape being left, and all pro&s;pect of &s;uc|ce&s;sful re&s;i&s;tance being at an end, the &s;urvivors were forced to &s;ubmit. The bloody conflict la&s;ted forty-&s;even minutes. The major, with 150 of his men, fell in the action; 810, including regulars, were made pri&s;oners, 150 of whom were wounded, the remainder, about 440, e&s;caped. The whole number of the Briti&s;h regulars was &s;hort of one hundred. The Americans took 1,500 &s;tand of arms. Very few of the a&s;&s;ailants fell; but in their number was colonel Williams in Ninety Six di&s;trict, who had been very active in op|po&s;ing the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Briti&s;h government.</P>
<P>Ten of the royal militia who had &s;urrendered were hanged by their conquerors. They were provoked to this cruel mea&s;ure, by the &s;everity of the Briti&s;h, who had lately hanged &s;everal of the captured Ameri|cans, in South Carolina and Georgia. They al&s;o al|leged that the men who &s;uffered were guilty of previ|ous felonies, for which their lives were forfeited by the laws of the land. The remainder of the pri&s;oners, except about 130, were &s;oon after enlarged upon dif|ferent conditions.</P>
<P>Lord Cornwallis was &s;o confident of the &s;ucce&s;s of his &s;chemes, that he did not wait for the arrival of colonel Fergu&s;on at Charlotte; but advanced towards Sali&s;bury, and obliged the militia for &s;ecurity to cro&s;s the Yadkin and take po&s;t on its north bank. He halt|ed &s;hort of Sali&s;bury, and, hearing of colonel Fergu|&s;on's fate, faced about and returned to Charlotte. This was the fir&s;t misfortune which Cornwallis had ex|perienced, and he &s;oon found that major Fergu&s;on's de|feat operated as a check on the future exertion of the loyali&s;ts. Their timidity re&s;trained them from ri&s;king any more in &s;upport of the royal cau&s;e; re&s;erving
<PB N="318" REF="028963_0333_0FDDBFA426E0BE58">them&s;elves till the Briti&s;h army, by its own una&s;&s;i&s;ted efforts, &s;hould gain a decided &s;uperiority.</P>
<P>Cornwallis retreated about the 14th of October to Wyn&s;borough; which was the more needful, as major Davie's corps, being greatly increa&s;ed, frequently in|tercepted his lord&s;hip's foraging parties and convoys. Riflemen al&s;o often penetrated near his camp, and from behind trees took care to make &s;ure of their ob|ject. Thus the late conquerors found their &s;ituation very unea&s;y. As the Briti&s;h retreated, the militia took &s;everal waggons, loaded with &s;tores and the knap|&s;acks of the light-infantry and legion; and &s;ingle men repeatedly rode up within gun-&s;hot of his army, di&s;|charged their pieces, and made their e&s;cape.</P>
<P>Sumpter, &s;oon after the di&s;per&s;ion of his corps on the 18th of Augu&s;t, collected a band of volunteers, partly from new adventurers, and partly from tho&s;e who had e&s;caped on that day. With the&s;e, though for three months there was no continental army in the &s;tate, he con&s;tantly kept the field in &s;upport of American inde|pendence. He varied his po&s;ition from time to time about Evoree, Broad and Tyger rivers, and had frequent &s;kirmi&s;hes with his adver&s;aries. His &s;pirit of enter|pri&s;e was &s;o particularly injurious to the Briti&s;h, that they laid &s;undry plans for de&s;troying his force,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nov.</HI> 12.</NOTE> without &s;ucce&s;s. He was at|tacked at Broad River by major We|mys, commanding a corps of infantry and drag|oons. In this action the Briti&s;h were defeated and their commander taken pri&s;oner. Eight days after, he was attacked at Black Stocks near Tyger River, by lieutenant colonel Tarleton. The attack was begun with 170 dragoons and 80 men of the 63d regiment. A con&s;iderable part of Sumpter's force was &s;tationed in a large log barn,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nov.</HI> 20.</NOTE> from the aper|tures of which they fired with &s;ecurity. Many of the 63d regiment were killed. Tarleton then
<PB N="319" REF="028963_0333_0FDDBFA426E0BE58">charged with his cavalry, but being unable to di&s;lodge the Americans, retreated; and Sumpter was left in quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the field. The lo&s;s of the Briti&s;h in this action was con&s;iderable. Among their killed were three officers, major Money, lieutenants Gib&s;on and Cope. The Americans lo&s;t very few; but general Sumpter received a wound, which for &s;ome months in|terrupted his gallant enterpri&s;es in behalf of his coun|try. The Americans kept their po&s;ition for &s;everal hours; but, knowing that the Briti&s;h would be reinforc|ed next morning, they cro&s;&s;ed the Tyger, carrying their wounded men with them.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Conwallis, in his account of this action, e&s;timates the num|ber of Americans at 1,000, and their killed, wounded and taken at about 120; and 50 killed and wounded of the Briti&s;h. Nor does he mention that the Americans remained in the po&s;t any time after the action, but that they were driven with lo&s;s over the river. <HI>Letter to fir Henry Clinton, December</HI> 3, 1780.</NOTE></P>
<P>The victory at Camden was looked upon to be &s;o deci&s;ive with regard to the &s;outhern colonies, that no farther ob&s;truction was thought to lie in the way of Lord Cornwallis from South Carolina to the Che&s;apeak;
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Oct.</HI> 15.</NOTE> and under this mi&s;|taken notion, &s;ir Henry Clinton di&s;patched general Le&s;slie from New York to the Che&s;apeak with 3,000 men, in order to co-operate with, and act under his lord&s;hip, and to prevent any &s;uccours from pa&s;&s;ing to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;outhern colonies. Cornwallis, however, being at too great a di&s;tance either to profit by a diver&s;ion, or to form a junction with Le&s;slie, or|ders were in&s;tantly &s;ent to that commander, to proceed to Charle&s;ton. He arrived at Charle&s;ton on the 13th of December, where he left one half of his troops, and &s;oon after marched up the country and joined Corn|wallis with the remainder.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t Cornwallis was making preparations for a powerful inva&s;ion of North Carolina, general Gates
<PB N="120" REF="028963_0334_0FDDBFA5914EC170">had been indu&s;triou&s;ly preparing to take the field. He had done every thing in his power to repair the in|juries of his defeat, and was, by the month of Novem|ber, in a condition to face the enemy, when general Green was &s;ent to &s;uper&s;ede him in the command of the &s;outhern army. General Greene upon all occa|&s;ions was the vindicator of Gates' reputation. In his letters and conver&s;ation, he uniformly maintained that his predece&s;&s;or had failed in no part of his military duty, and that he had de&s;erved &s;ucce&s;s, though he could not command it.</P>
<P>The other events of the &s;outhern campaign of 1780 con&s;i&s;ted of a few unimportant &s;kirmi&s;hes not worthy of being particularly mentioned. The whole campaign afforded ample evidence of the folly of pro&s;ecuting the American war. Though the Briti&s;h conque&s;ts had rapidly &s;ucceeded each other, yet no advantages ac|crued to the victors.

In April 1781, complete relief was obtained by the arrival of the Briti&s;h fleet under admiral Darby.
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>April</HI> 12.</NOTE> The fleet, con&s;i&s;ting of about 28 &s;ail of the line, &s;ailed from &amp;c.

<P>As the hopes of reducing this &s;tubborn garri&s;on by famine were found fruitle&s;s, it remained only to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the effects of bombardment. The unfortunate town of Gibralter was now expo&s;ed to the di&s;charge of 170 pieces of the heavie&s;t cannon, and 80 very large m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|tars. The&s;e continued to di&s;charge every day, for three weeks, from four to five thou&s;and &s;hot and &s;he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, and to expend at lea&s;t 100,000 pounds of gun-powder. It then &s;lackened, but was not intermitted for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> whole day for upwards of a year. The fatigues of the garri&s;on were extreme, but the lo&s;s of men was le&s;s than might have been expected. For the fir&s;t t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> weeks of this unexampled bombardment, the whole number of killed and wounded was only about 300. The damage done to the works was trifling. The weight of this cruel cannonade fell chiefly upon the inoffen&s;ive inhabitants, many of whom were killed, and their hou&s;es, about 500 in number, de&s;troyed. The number of the inhabitants, of various nations and religions, exceeded 3,000 at the beginning of the &s;iege. Such of them as were not buried in the ruins of their hou&s;es, or torn to pieces by the &s;hells, fled to the re|mote parts of the rocks, but de&s;truction followed them to places which had always been deemed &s;ecure. No &s;cene could be more deplorable. It is &s;aid mothers and children, cla&s;ped in each other's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, were, at the &s;ame in&s;tant, &s;o completely blown to pieces, that it
<PB N="327" REF="028963_0337_0FDDBFB01020A598">&s;eemed rather an annihilation, than a di&s;per&s;ion of their &s;hattered fragments. The ca&s;emates, which would alone afford &s;ecurity, were filled by the garri&s;on; and happy did ladies of the greate&s;t &s;en&s;ibility and mo&s;t delicate habits deem it, to be admitted to a few hours <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">po&s;e in them, amid&s;t the noi&s;e of a crowded &s;oldiery, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d the groans of the wounded who were brought in from the works.

At la&s;t, however, this dreadful firing began to &s;lacken. Even the trea&s;ures of Spain could not &s;upport &s;uch an im|men&s;e expenditure. After &s;iring 75,000 &s;hot, and 25,000 &s;hells, the number was reduced to about 600 of each every twenty-four hours, at which rate it con|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ed for &s;ome weeks longer. The prudence and experience of general Elliot directed him, likewi&s;e, to &s;ave his ammunition, and he allowed the Spaniards to wa&s;te them&s;elves and their trea&s;ures as they plea&s;ed, &s;eeming to behold their rage and violence with the ut|mo&s;t indifference.</P>
<P>The Spani&s;h arms met with more &s;ucce&s;s on this continent than in Europe. Don Bernardo de Galves, in addition to his &s;ucce&s;s in the year 1779, reduced the town and fort of Mobile in 1780. This con&s;ider|ably dimini&s;hed general Campbell's &s;mall force in We&s;t Florida; &s;o that Don Galves was induced to attempt the reduction of the whole colony, which would be in&s;ured by the taking of Pen&s;acola, the capital; and to this he was encouraged by the involved &s;tate of the Briti&s;h affairs, which every day become more embar|ra&s;&s;ed in all quarters of the globe. After &s;ome un&s;uc|ce&s;sful attempts, in the year 1780, which had failed in the out&s;et, Don Galves went to the Havannah, to take the command of a great expedition from thence,
<PB N="328" REF="028963_0338_0FDDBFB65FF47F08">which was intended for the beginning of the year 1781.

<P>The &s;iege of Gibralter &s;till continued, but the Span|iards, perceiving that the utmo&s;t violence of their fire produced no effect, confined them&s;elves to annoying the garri&s;on in the night time, and enlarging and per|fecting the fortifications and batteries with which the place was &s;urrounded.

<P>The abortive plans of the allies of the United States were &s;everely felt by the latter; but this was in a great mea&s;ure overbalanced by the embarra&s;&s;ments occa&s;ioned to Great Britain, by the armed neutrality of the northern powers in Europe, and by a rupture with Holland.</P>
<P>The &s;tates of Holland had kept an appearance of friend&s;hip with Britain for more than a century.

Britain had many cau&s;es of di&s;plea&s;ure with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">duct of the Dutch, and this year the hidden &s;eeds <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;cord bur&s;t into a violent flame.

The merchant &s;hips were afterwards condemned by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of admiralty.</P>
<P>The &s;tates, at that time, were divided into two fac|tions.

It was therefore re&s;olved to endeavour by an appearance of vigorous determination to detach them from the confederacy, and thereby induce that &s;tate to afford the &s;uccours &s;tipulated by treaty, which all negociation had hitherto failed of obtaining.</P>
<P>For the&s;e and other rea&s;ons, after previous but in|effectual warning given by the Briti&s;h mini&s;ters at Lon|don and at the Hague, a royal proclamation was i&s;&s;ued at London on the 17th of April, in which the non|performance of the &s;tates general with re&s;pect to the
<PB N="332" REF="028963_0340_0FDDBFBA92524AD8">&s;uccours &s;tipulated by treaty, was con&s;idered as a re|linqui&s;hment of the alliance concluded at London on the 11th of December, 1674; and that they had there|by placed them&s;elves in the condition of a neutral pow|er, bound by no treaty or connexion with Britain: And all the particular &s;tipulations re&s;pecting the &s;ub|jects of the &s;tates general contained in the treaties then &s;ub&s;i&s;ting were &s;u&s;pended provi&s;ionally.</P>
<P>The event which occa&s;ioned a formal declaration of war, was the capture of Henry Laurens, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> In the deranged &s;tate of the American finances, that gentle|man had been deputed by congre&s;s to &s;olicit a loan for their &s;ervice in the United Netherlands; and al&s;o to negociate a treaty between them and the United States.
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sept.</HI> 3.</NOTE> On his way thither, he was taken by the Ve&s;tal frigate, com|manded by captain Keppel. He had thrown his pa|pers overboard, but great part of them were recov|ered without having received much damage. The&s;e the mini&s;try carefully examined. Among them was found one purporting to be the plan of a treaty of am|ity and commerce, between the &s;tates of Holland and the United States of America. This had been origi|nally drawn up in con&s;equence of &s;ome conver&s;ation between William Lee, commi&s;&s;ioner from the United States to the courts of Vienna and Berlin, and John de Neufville, merchant of Am&s;terdam, as a plan of a treaty de&s;tined to be concluded hereafter: But it had never been propo&s;ed either by congre&s;s or by the &s;tates of Holland, though it had received the approbation of the pen&s;ionary Van Berkel and of the city of Am&s;ter|dam. Mr. Laurens him&s;elf was committed pri&s;oner to the Tower on the 6th of October, on a charge of high trea&s;on.</P>
<P>This was followed by a very angry memorial to the &s;tates general, which they received with great coolne&s;s,
<PB N="333" REF="028963_0340_0FDDBFBA92524AD8">and replied, that a full an&s;wer &s;hould be given as &s;oon as their con&s;titution would admit. The con&s;equence of this was a declaration of war.

<P>The capture of the i&s;land of St. Eu&s;tatius was the fir&s;t and greate&s;t blow which the Dutch received in the war.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1781.</NOTE> The i&s;land is in it&s;elf barren and contemptible, but was long the &s;eat of a mo&s;t lucrative commerce, and had be|come the grand free port of the We&s;t Indies and America, and a general market and magazine for all nations. The i&s;land is a natural fortification, and very capable of being made &s;trong; but its inhabitants were more &s;olicitous to cultivate commerce, than to improve the natural advantages of the i&s;land for their &s;ecurity. Its mo&s;t favourable &s;ea&s;ons were during the times of warfare among its neighbours, owing to its neutrality, &s;ituation, and its unbounded freedom of trade. So &s;trong was the &s;pirit of commerce in this place, that even when Holland was engaged in war, the &s;ame freedom of trade continued, and the enemy
<PB N="334" REF="028963_0341_0FDDBFBC103C5F40">were not only &s;upplied with all kinds of common nec|e&s;&s;aries, but even with naval and military &s;tores, as if no rupture with the parent &s;tate had taken place. It was in particular a mo&s;t convenient channel of &s;upply to the Americans.</P>
<P>Sir George Rodney and general Vaughan with a large fleet and army &s;urrounded this i&s;land,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Feb.</HI> 3.</NOTE> and &s;ent a peremptory &s;ummons to the gov|ernour to &s;urrender the i&s;land and its de|pendencies within an hour, accompanied with a threat, that if any re&s;i&s;tance was made, he mu&s;t abide the con&s;equences. M. de Graaf, utterly ignorant of the rupture between Great Britain and Holland, could &s;carcely believe the officer who delivered the &s;um|mons to be &s;erious. He returned for an&s;wer, that, be|ing utterly incapable of making any defence, he mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity &s;urrender, only recommending the town and inhabitants to the clemency of the Briti&s;h com|manders. The wealth of the place excited the a&s;ton|i&s;hment of the conquerors, who found the &s;tore hou&s;es filled with valuable commodities, and the very beach was covered with hog&s;heads of &s;ugar and tobacco. The value was e&s;timated con&s;iderably above three mil|lions &s;terling. But this was only a part; for above 150 ve&s;&s;els of all denominations, mo&s;t of which were richly laden, were captured in the bay. A Dutch frigate of 38 guns and five &s;mall armed ve&s;&s;els &s;hared the &s;ame fate. The neighbouring i&s;lands of St. Mar|tin and Saba were in like manner reduced.</P>
<P>Admiral Rodney being informed that a fleet of about 30 large &s;hips all richly laden with We&s;t India commodities, had &s;ailed from Eu&s;tatia for Holland ju&s;t before his arrival, under convoy of a flag &s;hip of 60 guns, he di&s;patched the Monarch and Panther, with the Sybil frigate in pur&s;uit of them. The&s;e &s;oon over|took the convoy, when the Dutch admiral refu&s;ing to
<PB N="335" REF="028963_0341_0FDDBFBC103C5F40">&s;trike his colours, and all remon&s;trances proving inef|fectual, a &s;hort engagement took place between his &s;hip the Mars, and the Monarch. He died bravely in defence of his &s;hip, when &s;he in&s;tantly &s;truck, and the whole convoy was taken.</P>
<P>The keeping the Dutch colours flying at Eu&s;tatia, &s;erved for &s;ome time as a decoy to French, Dutch, and American ve&s;&s;els, a con&s;iderable number of which fell accordingly into the hands of the conquerors without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ouble.</P>
<P>The Dutch We&s;t India company, many of the cit|izens of Am&s;terdam, and &s;everal Americans were great &s;ufferers by the capture of this i&s;land, and the confi&s;ca|tion of all property found therein, which immediately followed. But the Briti&s;h merchants &s;uffered much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, who, confiding in the neutrality of the place, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ome acts of parliament made to encourage the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">inging their property from the i&s;lands lately taken by the French, had collected a va&s;t quantity of We&s;t In|dia and European goods in this place. They &s;tated their hard ca&s;e to admiral Rodney and general Vaug|han, who returned for an&s;wer, "That the i&s;land was Dutch, every thing in it was Dutch, was under the protection of the Dutch flag, and as Dutch it &s;hould be treated."</P>
<P>The &s;everity with which the victors proceeded, drew on them pointed cen&s;ures not only from the immedi|ate &s;ufferers, but from all Europe. The merchants and traders were ordered to give up their books, their letters, and inventories of all their effects, inclu&s;ive of an exact account of all money and plate in their po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion. The Jews were treated as objects of particular re&s;entment. They were ordered to give up the keys of their &s;tores, to leave their wealth and merchandize be|hind them, and to depart the i&s;land without knowing the place of their de&s;tination. Nor did the policy of
<PB N="336" REF="028963_0342_0FDDBFC49B37AAA8">the unfortunate Hebrews now avail them. They were &s;tripped, &s;earched, and de&s;poiled of &s;uch money and jewels as they had &s;ecreted. Several Americans and native Dutch, as well as Jews, were ordered off the i&s;land. Many opulent per&s;ons, in con&s;equence of the&s;e proceedings, were in&s;tantly reduced to extreme indi|gence. In this di&s;tre&s;s, the a&s;&s;embly of the i&s;land of St. Chri&s;tophers gave refuge and a&s;&s;i&s;tance to many of the unhappy exiles.</P>
<P>To complete the work, nothing now remained but to di&s;po&s;e of the goods which had been &s;eized. For this purpo&s;e, public &s;ales were adverti&s;ed; purcha&s;ers from every nation were promi&s;cuou&s;ly invited; a&s;&s;urances of protection given them without exception, and the i&s;l|and became the &s;cene of the greate&s;t auction that perhaps was ever opened in the world. The goods were &s;old for a mere trifle in proportion to their val|ue; and the French were &s;aid to have made the larger and mo&s;t lucrative purcha&s;es. The greate&s;t part of the goods were conveyed to French and Dani&s;h i&s;land, and by the inhabitants of them di&s;po&s;ed of to the ene|mies of Great Britain, for &s;upplying whom in the or|dinary way of commerce, St. Eu&s;tatius had &s;uffered to &s;everely.</P>
<P>Thus was the attention of the Briti&s;h commander directed to an object undoubtedly below his dignity, and highly derogatory, not only to the honour but to the intere&s;t of Britain; as, at this critical period, de Gra&s;&s;e was &s;ailing for the We&s;t Indies with that fleet and army which a&s;&s;i&s;ted general Wa&s;hington to decide the fate of America. A &s;mall part of the French force was de&s;tined for the Ea&s;t Indies, but M. de Gra&s;&s;e with the greater part &s;ailed for Martinico. The Briti&s;h fleet, then in the We&s;t Indies, had been previou&s;ly weakened by the departure of a &s;quadron for the protection of the &s;hips, which were employed

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AT the beginning of the year 1781, an affair happen|ed, from which expectations were formed by &s;ir Henry Clinton, that &s;ome con&s;iderable advantage might be derived to the royal cau&s;e, viz. the revolt of the Penn|&s;ylvania line. The long continuance of the war, and the difficulties under which the congre&s;s laboured, had prevented their troops from being paid, or even prop|erly &s;upplied with nece&s;&s;aries and conveniences. Gen|eral Arnold's addre&s;s to his countrymen had no effect in detaching them from the unproductive &s;ervice of congre&s;s; but their complicated di&s;tre&s;&s;es at length broke out into deliberate mutiny. This event, which had long been expected, made its fir&s;t threatening ap|pearance in the Penn&s;ylvania line. The privates en|li&s;ted in that &s;tate were for the mo&s;t part natives of Ireland, and were inferior to none in di&s;cipline, courage or attachment to the cau&s;e of independence. A great part of them were enli&s;ted for three years or during the war; the three years were expired, and the men in&s;i&s;ted that the choice of &s;taying or going remain|ed with them, whil&s;t the officers contended that the choice was in the &s;tate. On the fir&s;t of January,
<PB N="339" REF="028963_0343_0FDDBFC5CF955D58">1,300 of the&s;e troops turned out and declared they would &s;erve no longer, unle&s;s their grievances were re|dre&s;&s;ed. A riot en&s;ued, in which an officer was killed and four wounded; five or &s;ix of the in&s;urgents were al&s;o wounded. They then collected the artillery, &s;tores, provi&s;ions, and waggons, and marched out of the camp. They pa&s;&s;ed by the quarters of general Wayne, who &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to them, reque&s;ting them to de&s;i&s;t, or the con&s;equences would prove fatal. They refu&s;ed, and proceded on their march till the evening, when they took po&s;t on an advantageous piece of ground, elected officers from among them&s;elves, and appointed a &s;erjeant major, who had formerly de&s;erted from the Briti&s;h army, to be their commander. On the &s;econd they marched to Middlebrook, and on the third to Princetown, where they fixed their quarters. On that day a flag of truce was &s;ent to them from the officers of the American camp, with a me&s;&s;age, de&s;iring to know what were their intentions. Some of them an&s;wered, that they had already &s;erved longer than the time for which they were enli&s;ted, and would &s;erve no longer; and others, that they would not return, unle&s;s their grievances were redre&s;&s;ed. But at the &s;ame time, they repeatedly and in the &s;tronge&s;t terms denied be|ing influenced by the lea&s;t di&s;affection to the Ameri|can cau&s;e, or having any intentions of de&s;erting to the enemy.</P>
<P>Intelligence of this tran&s;action was &s;oon conveyed to New York. A large body of Briti&s;h troops were im|mediately ordered to hold them&s;elves in readine&s;s to move on the &s;horte&s;t notice, it being hoped that the American revolters might be induced to join the royal army. Me&s;&s;engers were al&s;o &s;ent to them from gener|al Clinton, acquainting them that they &s;hould directly be taken under the protection of the Briti&s;h govern|ment; that they &s;hould have a free pardon for all for|mer
<PB N="340" REF="028963_0344_0FDDBFC7571C7D18">offences; and that the pay due to them from the congre&s;s &s;hould be faithfully paid them without any ex|pectation of military &s;ervice, unle&s;s it &s;hould be volun|tary, upon condition of their laying down their arms and returning to their allegiance. It was al&s;o recom|mended to them to move beyond the South River; and they were a&s;&s;ured, that a body of Briti&s;h troops &s;hould be ready to protect them whenever they de&s;ired it. The&s;e propo&s;itions were rejected with di&s;dain; and they even delivered up two of &s;ir Henry Clinton's me&s;|&s;engers to the congre&s;s, who being tried were condemn|ed as Briti&s;h &s;pies, and in&s;tantly executed. Jo&s;eph Reid, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> pre&s;ident of the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, and general Potter afterwards repaired to them at Princeton, and an accommodation took place: &s;uch of them as had &s;erved out their full terms were permitted to re|turn to their own homes, and others again joined the American army, upon receiving &s;atisfactory a&s;&s;urances that their grievancies &s;hould be redre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>About 160 of the Jer&s;ey troops mutinied in the &s;ame month, but by prudent and re&s;olute mea&s;ures they were reduced to obedience. Two of the greate&s;t of|fenders were put to death on the &s;pot, and the execu|tioners were &s;elected from among the mo&s;t active in the mutiny.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the natural alarm &s;uch mutinies occa&s;ioned, and the perilous &s;ituation of the republic, congre&s;s were for &s;ome time unable to give permanent relief to the army. Provi&s;ions were partially &s;upplied, and by expedients from one &s;hort time to another. The mo&s;t u&s;ual was ordering an officer to &s;eize on pro|vi&s;ions whereever found. Recour&s;e was &s;o frequently had to coercion, both legi&s;lative and military, that the people not only lo&s;t confidence in public credit, but became &s;o impatient under all exertions of authority, for forcing their property from them, that it was appre|hended
<PB N="341" REF="028963_0344_0FDDBFC7571C7D18">they would proceed to dangerous in&s;urrections. Never was the patrioti&s;m of the American &s;oldiery ex|hibited in a more &s;triking view than in this calamitous period. It appears, indeed, wonderful how the army could have been kept together during a great part of this year. The American general Clinton in a letter to general Wa&s;hington, dated at Albany, April 16th, 1781, wrote as follows; "There is not now (independ|ent of Fort Schuyler) three days provi&s;ion in the whole department for the troops in ca&s;e of any alarm, for any pro&s;pect of procuring any. The recruits of the new levies I cannot receive, becau&s;e I have noth|ing to give them. The Canadian families I have &s;een obliged to deprive of their &s;canty pittance, contra|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to every principle of humanity. The quarter ma&s;ter's department is totally u&s;ele&s;s, the public armoury has been &s;hut up for near three weeks, and a total &s;u&s;pen|&s;ion of every military operation has en&s;ued. At this period of the war, there was little or no circulating medium, either in the form of paper or &s;pecie; and in the neighbourhood of the American army there was a &s;eal want of nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>The progre&s;&s;ive depreciation of the American paper money was a forerunner of its di&s;&s;olution. The con|tinental bills continued pa&s;&s;ing and depreciating till the &s;pring of this year, when &s;uddenly and by general con&s;ent they went out of circulation, without real|izing the hopes of the enemies, or the fears of the friends, of independence.</P>
<P>Without paper currency the Americans could not have carried on the war to the pre&s;ent period. Its public benefit, in this in&s;tance, compen&s;ated in the e&s;|timation of patriotic politicians, for the immen&s;e evils which it otherwi&s;e occa&s;ioned. The tender laws on the one hand, and depreciation on the other, rendered it the bane of &s;ociety. All cla&s;&s;es were infected. The
<PB N="342" REF="028963_0345_0FDDBFCE3AFA7320">mechanic, the farmer, the lawyer, the phy&s;ician, the member of congre&s;s, and even a few of the clergy, in &s;ome places, were contaminated, and commenced &s;pec|ulators. The morals of the people were corrupted be|yond any thing that could have been believed prior to the event. All ties of honour, blood, gratitude, hu|manity, and ju&s;tice were di&s;&s;olved. Old debts were paid in &s;everal &s;tates when the paper money was more than 70 for one in hard ca&s;h; and in Virginia when 300 for one. Brothers defrauded brothers, children parents, and parents children. It has been ob&s;erved by &s;ome that the <HI>Friends</HI> and <HI>Methodi&s;ts</HI> in Penn&s;ylva|nia were faithful to their engagements, and were not corrupted by handling paper money. Though the&s;e denominations excelled, there were many individuals, in all religious &s;ocieties throughout the United States, that pre&s;erved their integrity. As a &s;triking in&s;tance of the nature and defects of a depreciating paper cur|rency, the following is related out of many: A mer|chant of Bo&s;ton &s;old a hog&s;head of rum, for twenty pounds, ca&s;k included. The purcha&s;er did not &s;ettle for it, till after the &s;eller applied to him for an empty hog&s;head, for which he was charged thirty pounds. When they came to &s;ettle, the merchant found upon examining, that he had to pay a balance of ten pounds on that very ca&s;k, which, with the rum it contained, he had &s;old for twenty.</P>
<P>"By the &s;cale of depreciation the war was car|ried on five years, for little more than a million of pounds &s;terling; and 200 millions of paper dollars were made redeemable by five millions of &s;ilver ones. In other countries, &s;uch mea&s;ures would probably have produced popular in&s;urrections, but in the United States they were &s;ubmitted to with|out any tumults. Public faith was violated, but in the opinion of mo&s;t men public good was promoted."
<PB N="343" REF="028963_0345_0FDDBFCE3AFA7320">Gold and &s;ilver now &s;ucceeded this fictitious curren|cy, being introduced into the United States by a ben|eficial trade with the French and Spani&s;h We&s;t India I&s;lands, and by means of the French army in Rhode I&s;land: And the quantity which had found its way from the Briti&s;h troops was by no means contemptible. The king of France, likewi&s;e, gave the United States a &s;ub&s;idy of &s;ix millions of livres, and became their &s;e|curity for ten millions more, borrowed for their u&s;e in the United Netherlands.</P>

Accordingly, in that year, the war raged not only in the vicinity of New York, but in Georgia, South and North Carolina, and in Virginia.</P>
<P>It has been already noticed that major general Le&s;s|lie had been detached from New York to Virginia, in the latter end of 1780, and &s;oon after returned to Charle&s;town, by orders from lord Cornwallis, in order to co-operate more effectually with the army un|der his lord&s;hip. Virginia was &s;oon after invad|ed by another party from New York. On the 4th of January,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Jan.</HI> 4.</NOTE> &s;ome &s;hips of war with a number of tran&s;ports, on board which was a large body of troops under the command of brigadier general Arnold, arrived at We&s;tover, about 140 miles from the capes of Virginia, where the troops immediately landed and marched to Rich|mond;
<PB N="344" REF="028963_0346_0FDDBFD0E99785A0">which they reached without oppo&s;ition, the militia that was collected having retreated on their approach. Lieutenant colonel Simcoe marched from hence with a detachment of the Briti&s;h troops to We&s;t|ham, where they de&s;troyed one of the fine&s;t founde|ries for cannon in America, and a large quantity of &s;tores and cannon. General Arnold, on his arrival at Richmond, found there large quantities of &s;alt, rum, &s;ailcloth, and tobacco, the la&s;t of which he de&s;troyed to a very great amount. The Briti&s;h troops afterwards attacked and di&s;per&s;ed &s;ome &s;mall parties of the Amer|icans, took &s;ome &s;tores and a few pieces of cannon, and on the 20th of the &s;ame month marched into Port&s;|mouth.</P>
<P>General Arnold having committed &s;uch ravages in Virginia, as threatened to de&s;troy the very &s;inews of the war, general Wa&s;hington, notwith&s;tanding his weakne&s;s at pre&s;ent, was obliged to detach 1,200 men, under the conduct of the marquis de la Fayette, to its relief; and the French at Rhode I&s;land now thought an opportunity offered of atoning for their pa&s;t inac|tivity, by cutting off Arnold's retreat from the Che&s;a|peak. They were farther encouraged to make this at|tempt, by having lately acquired &s;ome addition to their own naval force, and the Briti&s;h fleet having &s;uffered by a dreadful tempe&s;t, in which the Culloden, a new 74 gun &s;hip, was totally lo&s;t; the Bedford, of the &s;ame force, was di&s;ma&s;ted; and the America driv|en &s;o far out to &s;ea, that &s;he was, for &s;ome time, &s;up|po&s;ed to be lo&s;t.</P>

The Briti&s;h had the advantage of more guns than the French, but the latter were much more &s;trongly manned than the former. The conte&s;t wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;o nearly balanced, that it ended without the lo&s;s of a &s;hip on either &s;ide.

<P>A few days after this engagement, a convoy arrived from New York, having on board general Philips, with 2,000 cho&s;en troops.
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>March</HI> 26.</NOTE> This officer, with his companions who were taken at Saratoga, had been, after long confine|ment, at la&s;t relea&s;ed by a new cartel concluded &s;ome months before; and he was now appointed commander in chief of the Virginia forces.</P>

<PB N="346" REF="028963_0347_0FDDBFD1E5A9FF90">open to them in every direction, for a very great ex|tent, and the mi&s;chief they did was in proportion. At Peter&s;burgh, on the &s;outhern branch of this river called Appomatax, 4,000 hog&s;heads, of tobacco were de&s;troyed. The damage done by the de&s;truction of &s;hipping and ve&s;&s;els of every &s;ort, as well as of bar|racks, warehou&s;es, and &s;tores of every kind was almo&s;t incredible. About four miles above a place called O&s;borne's, on the &s;ame branch of the river, a &s;tale &s;hip of 20 guns, another of 26 guns, a brigantine of 14 guns, be&s;ides many other armed ve&s;&s;els, were de|&s;troyed. Two &s;hips and ten &s;maller ve&s;&s;els, loaded with 2,000 hog&s;heads of tobacco, cordage and floor fell into Arnold's hands. At Manche&s;ter, which lies up the Fork, on the north branch of the river, near 230 miles from its mouth, they de&s;troyed 1,200 hog&s;heads of tobacco; the marquis de la Fayette, with his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> who had arrived the day before at Richmond, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, being &s;pectators of the conflagration, without being able to put a &s;top to it.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT has been already noticed, that, whil&s;t lord Corn|wallis was preparing for a powerful inva&s;ion of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">orth Carolina, general Greene &s;ucceeded general <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in the command of the &s;outhern army. He was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ked upon to be the be&s;t officer in the American &s;er|vice next to general Wa&s;hington him&s;elf, with whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> was in high favour; and he was accompanied by general Morgan, a brave and di&s;tingui&s;hed partizan, who, like the late colonel Fergu&s;on in the royal army, excelled in the knowledge of rifle arms. He had commanded tho&s;e rifle men who oppo&s;ed Burgoyne in the northern war, and who &s;o much excelled the In|dians in their own way, that, to u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion of that general, "they could not be brought within the &s;ound of a rifle &s;hot."</P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="028963_0348_0FDDBFD35D32EE08">
Within a few hours after general Greene took charge of the army at Charlotte Town a report was made of a gallant enterpri&s;e of lieutenant colonel Wa&s;hington.
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dec.</HI> 3.</NOTE> Being out on a forag|ing party he had penetrated within 13 miles of Camden, to Clermont the &s;eat of lieutenant colonel Rugely of the Briti&s;h militia. This was fortified by a block hou&s;e, and encompa&s;&s;ed by an abbatis, and was defended by upwards of one hundred of the inhabitants, who had &s;ubmitted to the Briti&s;h government. Lieutenant col|onel Wa&s;hington advanced with his cavalry, and planted the trunk of a pine tree, &s;o as to re&s;emble a field piece. The lucky moment was &s;eized on. A corporal of dragoons rode up, and made a peremptory demand of an immediate &s;urrender; when the garri&s;on, impre&s;&s;ed with the expectation of an immediate can|nonade in ca&s;e of their refu&s;al, &s;urrendered at di&s;|cretion, without a &s;hot being fired on either &s;ide. This favourable incident, in the juncture of affairs then exi&s;ting, through the &s;uper&s;tition to which mo&s;t men are more or le&s;s &s;ubject, was viewed by the ar|my as an omen of &s;ucce&s;s under the new commander.</P>
<P>Lord Cornwallis now began to make very vigorous exertions, in order to penetrate into North Carolina. On the 11th of January his lord&s;hip's army was in motion,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1781. <HI>Jan.</HI> 11.</NOTE> and advancing towards that province; but was &s;omewhat delayed by an attempt made by the Americans, under general Morgan, to make them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the valuable di&s;trict of Ninety Six. In order to prevent this, lord Cornwallis detached lieutenant colo|nel Tarleton, with 350 cavalty, part of the light in&s;en|try, the 7th regiment, the fir&s;t battalion of the 71&s;t regi|ment, and two three-pounders, to oppo&s;e the progre&s;s of Morgan, not doubting but that he would be able to perform this &s;ervice effectually. The Briti&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="349" REF="028963_0348_0FDDBFD35D32EE08">came up with the Americans under general Morgan <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the 17th of January. The Americans, two thirds <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> whom were militia, were drawn up in an open <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">od, at a place called the Cowpens, near Pacolet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. The Briti&s;h, be&s;ides their field-pieces, had the advantage of five to four in infantry, and of more than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to one in cavalry. The attack was begun b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> fir&s;t line of infantry, con&s;i&s;ting of the 7th regiment, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a corps of light infantry with a troop of cavalry placed on each flank. The fir&s;t battalion of the 71&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the remainder of the cavalry formed the re&s;erve. The American line &s;oon gave way, and their militia <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">itted the field; upon which the royal troops, &s;uppo&s;|ing the victory already gained, engaged with ardour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the pur&s;uit, and were thereby thrown into &s;ome di&s;|order. General Morgan's corps, who were &s;uppo&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> have been routed, then immediately faced about, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> threw in a heavy fire upon the king's troops, which occa&s;ioned the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion among them; and they were at length totally defeated by the Americans. The Briti&s;h had 10 commi&s;&s;ioned officers, and upwards of 100 rank and file killed; 200 wounded; 29 com|mi&s;&s;ioned officers, and above 500 privates taken pri&s;|oners. Two pieces of artillery, two &s;tandards, 800 mu&s;kets, 35 baggage waggons, and upwards of 100 dragoon hor&s;es fell into the hands of the Americans; whil&s;t the latter had only 12 men killed and 60 wounded. Lieutenant colonel Tarleton then retreated to Hamilton's ford, near the mouth of Bullock's cree<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> carrying with him part of his baggage, and de&s;troying the remainder.</P>
<P>This defeat of the troops under Tarleton was a &s;e|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">re &s;troke to lord Cornwallis, as the lo&s;s of his light infantry was a great di&s;advantage to him. The day after the event he employed in collecting the remains of Tarleton's corps, and in endeavouring to form a
<PB N="350" REF="028963_0349_0FDDBFD4D2AD95F0">junction with general Le&s;slie, who had been ordered to march towards him with a body of Briti&s;h troops from Wynne&s;borough. Con&s;iderable exertions were then made by part of the army, without baggage, to retake the pri&s;oners in the hands of the Americans, and to intercept general Morgan's corps on its retreat to the Catawba. But that American officer, after his defeat of Tarleton, had made forced marches up into the country, and cro&s;&s;ed the Catawba the evening be|fore a great rain, which &s;welled the river to &s;uch a de|gree, as to prevent the royal army from cro&s;&s;ing for &s;everal days; during which time the Briti&s;h pri&s;oners were got over the Yadkin; whence they proceeded to Dan River, which they al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed, and on the 14th of February had reached Court-hou&s;e, in the province of Virginia.</P>
<P>The Americans met with very providential e&s;capes in this hot pur&s;uit. The Briti&s;h reached the Catawba on the evening of the &s;ame day on which their fleeing adver&s;aries had cro&s;&s;ed it: And it is certain that if the ri&s;ing of the river had taken place a few hours earlier, general Morgan with his whole detachment and 500 pri&s;oners would have &s;carcely had any chance of e&s;|cape. The &s;ame good fortune, attended with &s;imilar circum&s;tances, protected them on pa&s;&s;ing the Yadkins.</P>
<P>Lord Cornwallis employed a halt of two days in collecting &s;ome flour, and in de&s;troying &s;uperfluous baggage and all his waggons, excepting tho&s;e laden with ho&s;pital &s;tores, &s;alt, and ammunition, and four re&s;erved empty in readine&s;s for &s;ick or wounded. Be|ing thus freed from all unnece&s;&s;ary incumbrances, he marched through North Carolina with great rapid|ity, and penetrated to the remote&s;t extremities of that province on the banks of the Dan. His progre&s;s was &s;ometimes impeded by parties of the militia, and &s;ome &s;kirmi&s;hes en&s;ued, but he met with no very con&s;idera|ble
<PB N="351" REF="028963_0349_0FDDBFD4D2AD95F0">oppo&s;ition. On the fir&s;t of February the king's &s;cops cro&s;&s;ed the Catawba at M'Cowan's Ford, where the river is upwards of 500 yards wide and about three <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> deep, &s;u&s;taining a con&s;tant fire from the militia <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the oppo&s;ite bank without returning it till they had made good their pa&s;&s;age. The light infantry and grenadier companies, as &s;oon as they had reached the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, di&s;per&s;ed the Americans, who&s;e brave leader, general David&s;on, was killed at the fir&s;t on&s;et.</P>
<P>When lord Cornwallis arrived at Hill&s;borough, he erected the king's &s;tandard, and invited, by proclama|tion, all loyal &s;ubjects to repair to it, and to &s;tand forth and take an active part in a&s;&s;i&s;ting his lord&s;hip to re&s;tore order and government. He had been taught to believe that the king's friends were numerous in that part of the country: But the event did not con|form the truth of the repre&s;entations that had been given. The royali&s;ts were but few in number, and &s;ame of them too timid to join the king's &s;tandard. There were, indeed, about 350 who were proceeding to Hill&s;borough, under colonel Pyle, in order to avow their attachment to the royal cau&s;e; but they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">et accidentally, and &s;urrounded by a detachment from the American army, who had now re-cro&s;&s;ed the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, by whom a number of them are &s;aid to have been killed when they were begging for quarter, with|out making the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance. Meanwhile general Greene was marching with great expedition with the troops under his command, in order to form a junc|tion with other corps of American troops, that he might thereby be enabled to put &s;ome effectual &s;top to the progre&s;s of the Briti&s;h. This enterpri&s;ing and politic general, whil&s;t unequal even to defen&s;ive opera|tions, contrived to keep alive the courage of his party, to depre&s;s that of the loyali&s;ts, and to hara&s;s the fora|gers and detachments of the Briti&s;h, till reinforce|ments
<PB N="352" REF="028963_0350_0FDDBFDE22111990">&s;hould arrive. He lay &s;even days within ten miles of Cornwallis' camp, but took a new po&s;ition every night, and kept it a profound &s;ecret where the next was to be. By the&s;e manoeuvres, Cornwallis could never gain information of his &s;ituation in time to profit by it. By various arts be avoided an action for three weeks, during which time he was often obliged to a&s;k bread from the common &s;oldiers, having none of his own. Soon after this period, he was in condition to give battle to the enemy.</P>
<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions, colonel Balfour, who commanded at Charle&s;ton, equipped a &s;mall force for an expedition to Cape Fear River. Major Craig was di&s;patched on this &s;ervice with about 300 troops to|wards the end of January, under the convoy of a frig|ate and two &s;loops of war, commanded by captain Barclay. The troops landed about nine miles from Wilmington, and on the 28th of January entered that town, which, having the command of the river, was made a po&s;t of &s;ome &s;trength, and continued to be of importance whil&s;t Cornwallis remained in that country.</P>
<P>General Greene having effected a junction about the 10th of March with a continental reg|iment of what were called <HI>eighteen months men,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>March.</HI> 10.</NOTE> and two large bodies of militia be|longing to Virginia and North Carolina, formed a re&s;|olution to attack the Briti&s;h troops under the com|mand of lord Cornwallis. The American army march|ed from the High Rock Ford on the 12th of the month, and on the 14th arrived at Guildford. Lord Cornwallis, from the information he had received of the motions of the American general, concluded what were his de&s;igns. As they approached more nearly to each other, a few &s;kirmi&s;hes en&s;ued between &s;ome advanced parties, in which the advantage was &s;ome|times
<PB N="353" REF="028963_0350_0FDDBFDE22111990">gained by the Americans, and &s;ometimes by the Briti&s;h.
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>March</HI> 15.</NOTE> On the morn|ing of the 15th, lord Cornwallis march|ed with his troops at day-break in order to meet the Americans or to attack them in their encampment. About four miles from Guildford, the advanced guard of the Briti&s;h army, commanded by lieutenant colonel Tarleton, fell in with a corps of the Americans, con|&s;i&s;ting of lieutenant colonel Lee's legion, &s;ome Back Mountain men and Virginia militia, with whom he had a &s;evere &s;kirmi&s;h, and was, at length, obliged to retreat.</P>
<P>The greater part of the country in which the action happened is a wilderne&s;s, with a few cleared fields inter&s;per&s;ed. The American army was po&s;ted on a ri&s;ing ground about a mile and a half from Guildford court-hou&s;e. It was drawn up in three lines: the front line was compo&s;ed of the North Carolina militia, under the command of the generals Butler and Eaton; the &s;econd line, of Virginia militia, commanded by the generals Stephens and Law&s;on, forming two brig|ades; the third line, con&s;i&s;ting of two brigades, one of Virginia and one of Maryland continental troops, commanded by general Hugar and colonel Williams. Lieutenant colonel Wa&s;hington, with the dragoons of the fir&s;t and third regiments, a detachment of light in|fantry compo&s;ed of continental troops, and a regiment of riflemen under colonel Lynch, formed a corps of ob&s;ervation for the &s;ecurity of their right flank. Lieu|tenant colonel Lee, with his legion, a detachment of light infantry, and a corps of riflemen under colonel Campbell, formed a corps of ob&s;ervation for the &s;ecu|rity of their left flank. The attack of the American army was directed to be made by lord Cornwallis in the following order: On the right, the regiment of Bo&s;e and the 71&s;t regiment, led by major general

</ARGUMENT>
<P>LORD Cornwallis, after his victory over general Greene at Guildford, proceeded, as has been re|lated, to Wilmington, where he arrived on the 7th of April. This march had the appearance of a retreat; and whil&s;t he remained at Wilmington his &s;ituation was not much mended. His force was not greatly above 1,000 effective men; &s;o that it appeared equally dif|ficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to return to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of lord Rawdon, of who&s;e misfortunes he had heard, or to maintain his ground in the &s;ituation he then occu|pied. He therefore took the bold and hazardous re&s;|olution of marching into Virginia, and effecting a junction with general Philips. His lord|&s;hip &s;et out on the 25th of April,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>April</HI> 25.</NOTE> after having &s;ent in&s;tructions to colonel Balfour at Charle&s;ton to &s;end tran&s;ports and provi&s;ions to Wilmington for the u&s;e of the troops, in ca&s;e of any misfortune. The marquis de la Fayette, who kept on the north &s;ide of James' River, being informed of his de&s;ign, made a rapid movement in order to get before
<PB N="367" REF="028963_0357_0FDDBFF092EEBDA0">the Briti&s;h. The vigilance of lord Cornwallis, how|ever, di&s;appointed his antagoni&s;t.</P>
<P>On the 20th of May, his lord&s;hip arrived at Peter&s;|burg in Virginia, where he joined a body of Briti&s;h troops that had been under the command of major general Philips;
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>May</HI> 20.</NOTE> but the command of which, in con&s;equence of the death of that officer, who had been cut off by a fever a few lays before, had devolved upon brigadier general Ar|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ld. Before this junction he had encountered con|&s;iderable inconveniencies from the difficulty of pro|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ring provi&s;ions and forage; &s;o that in a letter to &s;ix Henry Clinton he informed him, that notwith&s;tanding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is &s;upplies at Wilmington, his cavalry wanted every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing, and his infantry every thing but &s;hoes. "Nei|ther," &s;ays he, "are in any condition to move, and yet they mu&s;t march to-morrow." He added, that he had experienced the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of marching hundreds of miles in a country chiefly ho&s;tile, without one active <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> u&s;eful friend, without intelligence, and without communication with any part of the country. Soon after his arrival, a reinforcement of 1,500 men joined his lord&s;hip from New York. About the &s;ame time, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> received information that three Briti&s;h regiments <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad &s;ailed from Corke for Charle&s;ton. The&s;e circum|&s;tances, together with lord Rawdon's report of the ad|vantage he had gained over general Greene, ea&s;ed his mind of all anxiety for South Carolina, and in&s;pired him with hopes of a glorious campaign.</P>
<P>Lord Cornwallis having taken upon him&s;elf the com|mand of the army, found no enemy capable of oppo&s;|ing him in the field. Having &s;tationed a body of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oops at Port&s;mouth under general Le&s;slie, he advanc|ed from Peter&s;burgh to James' River, which having cro&s;&s;ed, he pa&s;&s;ed through Hanover county, and cro&s;&s;|ed the South Anna or Pamunkey River. The marquis
<PB N="368" REF="028963_0358_0FDDBFF21223C0C8">de la Fayette followed his motions, but at a guarded di&s;tance. The &s;uperiority of the Briti&s;h army, e&s;pec|ially of their cavalry, which they ea&s;ily &s;upplied with good hor&s;es from the &s;tables and pa&s;tures of the Vir|ginians, enabled them to &s;cour the country in all di|rections. Lieutenant colonel Tarleton and lieutenant colonel Simpcoe were &s;ent with &s;eparate bodies of troops upon two di&s;tant expeditions. The former to Charlotteville to attempt capturing the governour and a&s;&s;embly of the State, and the latter to de&s;troy &s;tores as Point of Fork. Tarleton &s;ucceeded &s;o far as to di&s;per&s;e the a&s;&s;embly, capture &s;even of its members, and to de|&s;troy a great quantity of &s;tores at and near Charlo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|ville. Simpcoe was only in part &s;ucce&s;sful, for the Americans had removed the mo&s;t of their &s;tores from Point of Fork. In the cour&s;e of the&s;e marches and countermarches immen&s;e quantities of property were de&s;troyed, many unimportant &s;kirmi&s;hes took place, and many partial conque&s;ts were made by the Briti&s;h with|out any durable effect. The marquis de la Fayette acted with &s;o much caution, made &s;o judicious a choice of po&s;ts, and &s;hewed &s;o much vigour and de&s;ign in his movements, as to prevent any advantage being taken of his weakne&s;s. He effected a junction at Racoon Ford with general Wayne, who was at the head of 800 Penn&s;ylvanians. Whil&s;t this junction was forming, the Briti&s;h got between the American army and its &s;tores, which had been removed from Richmond to Albemarle old court hou&s;e. The marquis had the ad|dre&s;s to extricate him&s;elf from this difficulty. By forc|ed marches he got within a few miles of the enemy when they were two days march from Albemarle court hou&s;e, and opened in the night a nearer road to the court hou&s;e, which had been long di&s;u&s;ed and was much embarra&s;&s;ed. To the &s;urpri&s;e of lord Cornwal|lis,
<PB N="369" REF="028963_0358_0FDDBFF21223C0C8">the marquis fixed him&s;elf next day between the Brit|i&s;h army and the American &s;tores.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip now commenced a retrograde move|ment, and, accompanied with his detachments under Tarleton and Simpcoe, in two night's marches mea&s;ur|ed back upwards of 50 miles. When he reached Richmond the marquis was pre&s;|&s;ing hard after him.
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>June</HI> 17.</NOTE> On the 18th the Brit|i&s;h moved towards the Americans, &s;eemingly with a de&s;ign of &s;triking a detached corps. But upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arching of the light infantry and Penn&s;ylvanians, they returned into the town. About this time the marquis was reinforced by baron de Steuben's troops, and by militia from the parts adjacent. He followed lard Cornwallis, and had the addre&s;s to impre&s;s him with an idea that the American army was much great|er than it really was. His lord&s;hip therefore retreat|ed to William&s;burg. The day after the main body of the Briti&s;h army arrived there,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>June</HI> 26.</NOTE> their rear was attacked by an Amer|ican light corps under colonel Butler, and had 33 kill|ed and wounded.</P>
<P>According to a private letter &s;ent by Fayette to the pre&s;ident of Congre&s;s, his own troops at this period con&s;i&s;ted only of 1,500 regulars, 400 new levies, and about 2,000 militia, in all 3,900; whil&s;t Cornwallis's amounted to 4,000 regulars, 800 of whom were mounted.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the&s;e movements, be&s;ides articles &s;imilar to tho&s;e already mentioned, the Briti&s;h de&s;troy|ed above 2,000 hog&s;heads of tobacco, with &s;ome bra&s;s and a number of iron ordnance; but they were join|ed by no great number of inhabitants, and &s;carcely by any of the native Virginians. Lord Cornwallis, in his marches from Charle&s;ton to Camden, from Cam|den to the Dan River, from the Dan through North
<PB N="370" REF="028963_0359_0FDDBFFBF72FF1E8">Carolina to Wilmington, from Wilmington to Rich|mond, and from Richmond to William&s;burg, made a route of more than 1,100 miles, without computing de|viations.</P>
<P>About the time lord Cornwallis reached William&s;|burg, he received intelligence from New York, &s;et|ting forth the danger to which that city was expo&s;ed from a combined attack, that was &s;aid to be threat|ened, by the allies. Sir Henry Clinton therefore re|quired a detachment from earl Cornwallis, if not engaged in any important enterpri&s;e, and recommend|ed to him a healthy &s;tation, with an ample defen&s;ive force till New York &s;hould be out of danger. Lord Cornwallis, in order to comply with this requi&s;ition, determined to retire to Port&s;mouth, judging that he could more ea&s;ily maintain that po&s;t, with a dimini&s;hed force, than his pre&s;ent po&s;ition. For the execution of this project, he had to cro&s;s James' River. The marquis de la Fayette, judging this to be a favourable opportunity for an attack, advanced on the Briti&s;h. General Wayne being informed that the main body of the Briti&s;h had cro&s;&s;ed the river,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>July</HI> 6.</NOTE> pu&s;hed forward with 800 men to hara&s;s their rear; but to his great &s;urpri&s;e di&s;covered the Briti&s;h army, about &s;un-&s;et, ready to receive him. With great pre&s;ence of mind he extricated him&s;elf from his perilous &s;ituation, by boldly attacking and en|gaging them for a while, and then retreating with the utmo&s;t expedition. Lord Cornwallis, having &s;ecured the cannon which his adver&s;ary had left behind, would admit of no pur&s;uit. He &s;u&s;pected, from the &s;trange|ne&s;s of the circum&s;tances, that the whole was a &s;cheme to draw him into an ambu&s;cade. The Briti&s;h pa&s;&s;ed the river at night, and retired to Port&s;mouth without mole&s;tation.</P>
<P>Lord Cornwallis had previou&s;ly taken the nece&s;&s;ary &s;teps for forwarding a part of his command to New
<PB N="371" REF="028963_0359_0FDDBFFBF72FF1E8">York. But before they &s;ailed, an expre&s;s arrived from &s;ir Henry Clinton with a letter, expre&s;&s;ing his preference of William&s;burg to Port&s;mouth for the re&s;|idence of the army, and his de&s;ire that Old Point Comfort or Hampton Road &s;hould be &s;ecured as a &s;ta|tion for line of battle &s;hips. The commander in chief at the &s;ame time allowed his lord&s;hip to detain any part or the whole of the forces under his command, for completing this &s;ervice. It being a principal ob|ject of the campaign to fix on a &s;trong permanent po&s;t or place of arms in the Che&s;peak for the &s;ecurity of both the army and navy, and the places above men|tioned having been found to be altogether incapable of an&s;wering the end, York Town, on the river of that name, and Glouce&s;ter Point, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river, were con&s;idered as mo&s;t likely to accord with the views of the royal commanders. Lord Cornwallis availed him&s;elf of &s;ir Henry Clinton's permi&s;&s;ion to retain the whole force under his command, and having evacuated Port&s;mouth, returned in Augu&s;t, with the army to that penin&s;ula which lies between the great rivers James and York, and compo&s;es one of the riche&s;t and mo&s;t beautiful parts of Virginia. York Town is &s;ituated on the river of that name, on the narrowe&s;t part of the penin&s;ula, where it is about five miles broad; Glouce&s;ter Point is on the north and oppo&s;ite &s;ide and projects &s;o far into the river, that the di&s;tance betwixt the two is little more than a mile. They en|tirely command the navigation of the river which here is of &s;ufficient depth to admit &s;hips of a very large &s;ize and burthen. Both the&s;e po&s;ts therefore, were now fortified with the utmo&s;t care and diligence, and every method taken to make them equally &s;trong on the &s;ides of the land and water, the whole of his force amounting to 7,000 men.</P>
<P><PB N="372" REF="028963_0360_0FDDBFFD4F547810">
Whil&s;t his lord&s;hip was thus exerting him&s;elf to ren|der his po&s;t impregnable, all the &s;cattered operations of active ho&s;tility began at length to converge into a point, and the grand cata&s;trophe of the American war opened to the world.</P>
<P>An eventual plan of the whole campaign had been fixed at Weathersfield, at an interview between general Wa&s;hington,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>May</HI> 6.</NOTE> Knox, and du Portal, on the part of the Americans, and the count de Rochambeau and the chevalier Cha&s;teleux, on the part of the French. This was to lay &s;iege to New York in concert with a French &s;leet which was to arrive on the coa&s;t in the month of Augu&s;t. It was agreed that the French troops &s;hould march towards the North River. Letters were addre&s;&s;ed to the executive offi|cers of New Hamp&s;hire, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, Connecticut, and New Jer&s;ey, requiring them to fill up their battal|ions, and to have their quotas 6,200 militia in readine&s;s within a week of the time they might be called for. Accordingly the French troops marched from Rhode I&s;land in June, and early in the following month join|ed the American army. About the time this junction took place, general Wa&s;hington marched his army from their winter encampment near Peek&s;kill, to the vicinity of King's Bridge. General Lincoln fell down the North River with a detachment in boats, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ground where Fort Independence for|merly &s;tood. An attack was made upon him, but was &s;oon di&s;continued. The Briti&s;h about this time retired with almo&s;t the whole of their forces to York I&s;land. Flat bottomed boats &s;ufficient to tran&s;port 5,000 men were built near Albany, and brought down Hud&s;on's River to the neighbourhood of the American army be|fore New York. Every movement was made which was introductory to the commencement of the &s;iege. It was not a little mortifying to general Wa&s;hington,
<PB N="373" REF="028963_0360_0FDDBFFD4F547810">to find him&s;elf on the &s;econd of Augu&s;t to be only a few hundreds &s;tronger than he was on the day his ar|my fir&s;t moved from their winter quarters. He bore this hard trial, however, with his u&s;ual magnanimity, and contented him&s;elf with repeating his requi&s;itions to the &s;tates, and at the &s;ame time urged them by ev|ery tie, to enable him to fulfil engagements entered into on their account, with the commander of the French troops.</P>
<P>The tardine&s;s of the &s;tates, which at other times had brought them to the brink of ruin, was now accidental|ly of real &s;ervice. Had they &s;ent forward their recruits for the regular army, and their quotas of militia as was expected, the &s;iege of New York would have commenced in the latter end of July, or early in Au|gu&s;t. Whil&s;t the &s;ea&s;on was wa&s;ting away in expecta|tion of the&s;e reinforcements, lord Cornwallis as has been related, fixed him&s;elf near the capes of Virginia. His &s;ituation there, the arrival of a reinforcement of 3,000 Germans from Europe to New York, the delay in recruiting the army, and e&s;pecially the recent intelli|gence from count de Gra&s;&s;e, that his de&s;tination was fixed to the Che&s;apeak, concurred, about the middle of Augu&s;t,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Aug.</HI> 15.</NOTE> to make a total change of the plan of the campaign.</P>
<P>The American commander &s;till kept up the ap|pearance of an intention to attack New York, in order to amu&s;e and deceive the Briti&s;h general. Whil&s;t this deception was played off, the al|lied army cro&s;&s;ed the North River,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Aug.</HI> 24.</NOTE> and pa&s;&s;ed on by the way of Philadelphia to York Town.</P>
<P>At the time that the attack on New York was in &s;e|rious contemplation, a letter from general Wa&s;hington detailing the particulars of the intended operations of the campaign, being intercepted, fell into the hands of
<PB N="374" REF="028963_0361_0FDDBFFED6FF0DF0">&s;ir Henry Clinton. After the plan was changed, the royal commander was &s;o much under the im|pre&s;&s;ion of the intelligence contained in the inter|cepted letter, that he believed every movement to|wards Virginia to be a feint, calculated to draw off his attention from New York. Nor could he be brought to believe that the allies had fixed upon Virginia for the theatre of their intended operations, until the be&s;t opportunity for &s;triking them had elap&s;ed. When general Wa&s;hington arrived at Che&s;ter, he received the joyful news that count de Gra&s;&s;e had arrived in the Che&s;apeak on the 30th of Augu&s;t, with 28 &s;ail of the line from the We&s;t-Indies.
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Aug.</HI> 30.</NOTE> The count on his pa&s;&s;age fell in with and took a packet from Charle&s;ton, having lord Rawdon on board, who was on his return to Great Britain.</P>
<P>Count de Gra&s;&s;e, without lo&s;s of time, blocked up York River with three large &s;hips and &s;ome frigates, and moored the principal part of his fleet in Lynhaven Bay. Three thou&s;and French troops, brought in this fleet from the We&s;t Indies, commanded by the mar|quis de St. Simon, were di&s;embarked and &s;oon after formed a junction with the continental troops under the marquis de la Fayette, and the whole took po&s;t at William&s;burg. Lord Cornwallis intended to at|tack this force, but before all the nece&s;&s;ary arrange|ments were fixed upon, he received letters from &s;ir Henry Clinton announcing that he would do his utmo&s;t to reinforce the royal army in the Che&s;apeak, or make every diver&s;ion in his power, and that admiral Digby was hourly expected on the coa&s;t. On the re|ceipt of this intelligence earl Cornwallis, not thinking him&s;elf ju&s;tified in hazarding an engagement, aban|doned the re&s;olution of attacking the combined force of Fayette and St. Simon. And from an opinion that his in&s;tructions to &s;tand his ground were po&s;itive, or
<PB N="375" REF="028963_0361_0FDDBFFED6FF0DF0">that effectual relief was probable, his lord&s;hip thought proper to ri&s;k every thing on the i&s;&s;ue of a &s;iege. An attempt was made to burn or di&s;lodge the French &s;hips in the river, but none to evacuate his po&s;ts when that mea&s;ure was practicable.</P>
<P>Admiral Greaves with 20 &s;ail of the line made an ineffectual effort for the relief of Lord Cornwallis. When he appeared off the capes of Virginia, M. de Gra&s;&s;e with his &s;uperior fleet went out to meet him, and an indeci&s;ive engagement took place. The Brit|i&s;h were willing to renew the action; but de Gra&s;&s;e declined it.
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sept.</HI> 7.</NOTE> His chief object in coming out of the capes was to cover a French fleet of eight line of battle &s;hips, which was expected from Rhode I&s;land. Agreeably to a pre-con|certed plan, count de Barras, commander of this fleet, had &s;ailed for the Che&s;apeak about the time de Gra&s;&s;e &s;ailed from the We&s;t Indies for the &s;ame place. To avoid the Briti&s;h fleet, he had taken a circuit by Ber|muda; and de Gra&s;&s;e now came out to prevent the Briti&s;h from intercepting him, on his approach. Whil&s;t the ho&s;tile fleets were manoeuvring near the mouth of the Che&s;apeak, count de Barras pa&s;&s;ed the Briti&s;h fleet in the night, and got within the capes of Virginia. After the French fleet had obtained &s;uch a &s;uperiority, admiral Greaves &s;oon took his departure, and M. de Gra&s;&s;e re-entered the Che&s;apeak.</P>
<P>General Wa&s;hington and count Rochambeau reach|ed William&s;burg on the 14th of September. They with generals Cha&s;telleux,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sept.</HI> 14.</NOTE> Du Portal, and Knox proceeded to vi&s;it count de Gra&s;&s;e on board the &s;hip the Ville de Paris, and agreed on a plan of operations.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the combined armies were advancing to the &s;iege of York Town, &s;ir Henry Clinton determined on an excur&s;ion from New York to Connecticut, vainly
<PB N="376" REF="028963_0362_0FDDC00612B189A8">thinking that the alarm might recal part of the Ameri|can force to the defence of that country. The con|duct of this expedition was committed to general Ar|nold, and its object was the town of New London in his native country.</P>
<P>"The troops employed therein, were landed in two detachments on each &s;ide of the harbour. The one was commanded by lieutenant col|onel Eyre,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sept.</HI> 6.</NOTE> and the other by general Arnold. The latter met with little oppo&s;ition. Fort Trum|bull, and a redoubt which was intended to cover the harbour, not being tenable, were evacuated, and the men cro&s;&s;ed the river to fort Gri&s;wold on Groton hill. This was furiou&s;ly attacked by lieutenant col|onel Eyre. The garri&s;on defended them&s;elves with great re&s;olution, but after a &s;evere conflict of forty minutes, the fort was carried by the a&s;&s;ailants. The Americans had not more than &s;ix or &s;even men killed, when the Briti&s;h carried their lines; but a &s;evere ex|ecution took place afterwards, though re&s;i&s;tance had cea&s;ed. An officer of the conquering troops inquir|ed on his entering the fort who commanded. Col|onel Ledyard an&s;wered, "I did, but you do now;" and pre&s;ented him his &s;word. The colonel was im|mediately ran through the body and killed. Between 30 and 40 were wounded, and about 40 were carried off pri&s;oners. On the &s;ide of the Briti&s;h 48 were kill|ed and 145 wounded: Among the latter was major Montgomery, and among the former was colonel Eyre. About 15 ve&s;&s;els, loaded with the effects of the inhabitants, retreated up the river, and four others remained in the harbour unhurt; but all excepting the&s;e were burned by the communication of fire from the burning &s;tores. Sixty dwelling hou&s;es and 84 &s;tores were reduced to a&s;hes. The lo&s;s which the A|mericans &s;u&s;tained by the de&s;truction of naval &s;tores,
<PB N="377" REF="028963_0362_0FDDC00612B189A8">of provi&s;ions and merchandi&s;e, was immen&s;e. General Arnold having completed the object of the expedi|tion, returned in eight days to New York."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Briti&s;h account of this a&s;&s;ault is very different from the above. See Continuation of Hume's Hi&s;tory of England, Vol. VII, p. 634.</NOTE></P>
<P>Soon after general Wa&s;hington had vi&s;ited the French admiral, count de Gra&s;&s;e, the latter, wrote to the former, that in ca&s;e a Briti&s;h fleet appeared, "he conceived that he ought to go out and meet them at &s;ea, in&s;tead of ri&s;king an engagement in a confined &s;ituation." This alarmed the general. He &s;ent the marquis de la Fayette, with a letter to di&s;&s;uade him from the dangerous mea&s;ure. This letter and the per&s;ua&s;ions of the marquis had the de&s;ired effect.</P>
<P>The combined forces proceeded on their way to York Town, partly by land, and partly down the Che&s;apeak. The whole, together with a body of Virginia militia under the command of general Nel|&s;on, amounting in the aggregate to 12,000 men, ren|dezvou&s;ed at William&s;burg on the 25th of September,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sept.</HI> 25.</NOTE> and in five days after, mov|ed down to the inve&s;titure of York Town. The French fleet at the &s;ame time moved to the mouth of York River, and took a po&s;ition which was calculated to prevent lord Cornwallis either from retreating or receiving &s;uccours by water. Before the army marched from William&s;burg to York Town, general Wa&s;hington gave out in general orders as follows: "If the enemy &s;hould be tempted to meet the army on its march, the general particularly enjoins the troops to place their principal reliance on the bayonet, that they may prove the vanity of the boa&s;t which the Briti&s;h make of their peculiar prowe&s;s in deciding battles with that weapon."</P>
<P>The combined army halted in the evening, about two miles from York Town, and lay on their arms all
<PB N="378" REF="028963_0363_0FDDC0089C22DD98">night. On the next day colonel Scammell, an officer of great merit, was mortally wounded and taken pri&s;|on in approaching the outworks of the Briti&s;h. About this time earl Cornwallis received a letter from &s;ir Henry Clinton, announcing the arrival of admiral Digby with three &s;hips of the line from Europe, and the determinations of the general and flag officers in New York to embark 5,000 men in a fleet, which would probably &s;ail on the 5th of October&mdash;that this fleet con&s;i&s;ted of 23 &s;ail of the line, and that joint ex|ertions of the navy and army would be made for his re|lief. On the night after the receipt of this intelli|gence, earl Cornwallis quitted his outward po&s;ition, and retired to one more inward. On the 9th and 10th of October, the French and Americans open|ed their batteries;
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Oct.</HI> 10.</NOTE> and a tremendous roar of cannon and mortars was continued for &s;ix or eight hours without cea&s;ing. Major Cochran was &s;ent from New York on the 3d of October with a du|plicate of &s;ir Henry Clinton's letter. That gallant of|ficer went in a ve&s;&s;el to the Capes, and made his way to earl Cornwallis, through the whole French fleet, in an open boat. He got to York Town on the &s;ame day the Americans opened their batteries; and &s;oon after his arrival had his head carried off by a cannon ball. On the 10th and 11th the &s;hells of the be&s;iegers &s;et on fire and burned the Charon, of 44 guns, together with a guard &s;hip and a tran&s;port. Earl Cornwallis, it is &s;aid, was advi&s;ed at this juncture to evacuate York Town, and, after pa&s;&s;ing over to Glouce&s;ter, to force his way into the country. But had this movement been made, and the royal army been defeated or captured in the interior country, and in the mean time had &s;ir Henry Clinton reached York Town with the promi&s;ed relief, the precipitancy of the noble earl would have been perhaps more the &s;ubject of cen&s;ure, than his re&s;olu|tion
<PB N="379" REF="028963_0363_0FDDC0089C22DD98">of &s;tanding his ground and re&s;i&s;ting to the la&s;t ex|tremity.</P>
<P>On the 11th the be&s;iegers commenced their &s;econd parallel, 200 yards from the works of the be&s;ieged. Two redoubts which were advanced on the left of the Briti&s;h, greatly retarded the progre&s;s of the be&s;iegers; it was therefore determined to attack both at the &s;ame hour, on the evening of the 14th, as &s;oon as it was dark. To accompli&s;h their reduction as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Oct.</HI> 14.</NOTE> as well as to prevent jealou|&s;ies, the attack of the one was committed to the French, of the other to the Americans. Both de|tachments having pa&s;&s;ed the abbatis and pali&s;ades, with unloaded mu&s;kets carried them in a few minutes. The Americans had only 8 killed and 28 wounded; but the French lo&s;t a con&s;iderable number of men. Lieu|tenant colonel Lawrens, &s;on to the former pre&s;ident of congre&s;s, took the commanding officer pri&s;oner. His humanity and that of his a&s;&s;ociates &s;o overcame their re&s;entment that they &s;pared the Briti&s;h, though they were charged, when they went to the a&s;&s;ault, to remem|ber New London, and to retaliate by putting the men in the redoubt to the &s;word. Being a&s;ked why they had di&s;obeyed orders by bringing them off as pri&s;oners, they an&s;wered, "We could not put them to death, when they begged for their lives." About five of the Briti&s;h were killed and the re&s;t were captured. Colo|nel Hamilton who conducted the enterpri&s;e, in his re|port to the marquis de la Fayette, mentioned to the hon|our of his detachment, "that incapable of imitating examples of barbarity, and forgetting recent provoca|tions, they &s;pared every man who cea&s;ed to re&s;i&s;t."</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h were &s;o weakened by the fire of the combined armies, but chiefly by &s;ickne&s;s, that earl Corn|wallis could not venture any con&s;iderable number in the making of &s;allies. The pre&s;ent emergency, how|ever,
<PB N="380" REF="028963_0364_0FDDC00A1681A860">was &s;uch, that he ordered a &s;ortie of about 400 men, under lieutenant colonel Abercrombie. He made the attack with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Oct.</HI> 16.</NOTE> that the redoubts which covered the batteries were forced, and eleven pieces of cannon &s;piked. The French troops, who guarded that part of the intrenchment, &s;uffered con&s;iderably. This &s;ucce&s;sful exploit did hon|our to the officers and troops engaged, but produced no e&s;&s;ential benefit. The cannon, being ha&s;tily &s;piked, were again rendered &s;erviceable; and the combined forces were &s;o indu&s;trious, that, about four o'clock in the afternoon of the &s;ame day the batteries were fin|i&s;hed, and fired bri&s;kly. Their &s;everal batteries were now covered with nearly 100 pieces of heavy ordnance, whil&s;t the Briti&s;h works were &s;o de&s;troyed that they could &s;carcely &s;hew a &s;ingle gun.</P>
<P>Lord Cornwallis being now reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of preparing for a &s;urrender, or of attempting an e&s;|cape, determined on the latter. Boats were prepared under different pretences, for the reception of the troops by ten at night, in order to pa&s;s them over to Glouce&s;ter Point. The arrangements were made with the utmo&s;t &s;ecrecy. The intention was to abandon the baggage, and to leave a detachment behind to capitulate for the town's people, and for the &s;ick and wounded; his lord&s;hip having already prepared a let|ter on the &s;ubject, to be delivered to general Wa&s;h|ington after his departure. The fir&s;t embarkation had arrived at Glouce&s;ter Point, and the greater part of the troops were already landed, when the weather, which was before moderate and calm, in&s;tantly chang|ed to a mo&s;t violent &s;torm of wind and rain. The boats with the remaining troops were all driven down the river, and the de&s;ign of pa&s;&s;ing over was not only entirely fru&s;trated, but the ab&s;ence of the boats rendered it impo&s;&s;ible to bring back the troops from Glouce&s;ter.
<PB N="381" REF="028963_0364_0FDDC00A1681A860">Thus weakened and divided, the army was in no &s;mall danger. However, the boats returned, and the troops were brought back in the cour&s;e of the forenoon with very little lo&s;s.</P>
<P>Things were now ha&s;tening to a period which would no longer be protracted; for the Briti&s;h works were &s;inking under the weight of the French and American artillery. All hopes of relief from New York were over, and the &s;trength and &s;pirits of the royal army were broken down and exhau&s;ted by their con&s;tant and unremitting fatigue. Matters being in this &s;ituation,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Oct.</HI> 17.</NOTE> on the 17th of Oc|tober land Cornwallis &s;ent a letter to general Wa&s;hington, reque&s;ting a ce&s;&s;ation of arms for 24 hours, and that commi&s;&s;ioners might be appointed for dige&s;ting the terms of capitulation. Commi&s;&s;ioners were accordingly appointed; and on the &s;ide of the allies were vi&s;count de Noailles and lieutenant colonel Laurens, who&s;e father was in clo&s;e confinement in the Tower of London, whil&s;t the &s;on was drawing up ar|ticles, by which an Engli&s;h nobleman and a Briti&s;h ar|my became pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>On the 19th of October, the po&s;ts of York Town and Glouce&s;ter were &s;urrendered. The honour of marching out with colours flying, which had been de|med to general Lincoln, was now refu&s;ed to lord Cornwallis, and Lincoln was appointed to receive the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the royal army at York Town, preci&s;ely in the &s;ame way his own had been conducted, about 18 months before, at Charle&s;ton. The troops that &s;urrendered exceeded 7,000; but &s;o great was the number of &s;ick and wounded, that there were only 3,800 capable of doing duty. The officers and &s;ol|diers retained their baggage and effects. Fifteen hundred &s;eamen &s;hared the &s;ame fate as the garri&s;on. The Guadaloupe frigate of 24 guns, and a number
<PB N="382" REF="028963_0365_0FDDC00B9EE4A548">of tran&s;ports were &s;urrendered to the conquerors. About twenty tran&s;ports had been &s;unk or burned during the &s;iege, including the &s;hips already mention|ed. The land forces became pri&s;oners to congre&s;s; but the &s;eamen and &s;hips were a&s;&s;igned to the French admiral. The Americans obtained a fine train of ar|tillery, con&s;i&s;ting of 75 bra&s;s ordnance, and 69 iron cannon, howitzers and mortars. The regular troops of France and America employed in this &s;iege, con&s;i&s;t|ed of about 7,000 of the former, and 5,500 of the latter; and they were a&s;&s;i&s;ted by about 4,000 militia. On the part of the combined army about 300 were killed or wounded. On the part of the Briti&s;h about 500; and 70 were taken in the redoubts which were &s;tormed on the 14th of October.</P>
<P>Lord Cornwallis tried to obtain an indemnity for tho&s;e of the inhabitants who had joined him; but he was obliged to con&s;ent to deliver them up to the un|conditional mercy of their countrymen. His lord&s;hip neverthele&s;s obtained permi&s;&s;ion for the Boneta &s;loop of war to pa&s;s unexamined to New York. This gave an opportunity of &s;kreening &s;uch of them as were mo&s;t obnoxious to the Americans.</P>
<P>A Briti&s;h fleet of 25 &s;ail of the line, two fifty gun &s;hips, and eight frigates, having on board Sir Henry Clinton, with 7,000 of his be&s;t troops, de&s;tined for the relief of lord Cornwallis, arrived off the Che&s;apeak on the fifth day after his &s;urren|der;
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Oct.</HI> 24.</NOTE> but on receiving advice of this event, they returned to Sandy Hook. And de Gra&s;&s;e re|mained in the Che&s;apeak till the 5th of November, when he &s;et &s;ail for the We&s;t Indies.</P>

<P>The campaign of 1781 terminated in all parts of the United States in favour of the Americans. The Briti&s;h were now confined to their garri&s;ons in New York, Charle&s;ton, and Savannah. After the capture of lord Cornwallis, general Wa&s;hington returned with the greate&s;t part of his force to the vicinity of New York. The Briti&s;h having good rea&s;ons for not urg|ing ho&s;tilities without their lines, and general Wa&s;h|ington not being in condition to attempt the reduction of that po&s;t, &s;ome indeci&s;ive excur&s;ions of &s;mall con|&s;equence took place. This in a great mea&s;ure was al&s;o the ca&s;e in South Carolina. General Greene had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the &s;tate except Charle&s;ton and the vicinity. The Briti&s;h &s;ometimes &s;allied out of their lines for the acqui&s;ition of property and provi&s;ions. In oppo&s;ing one of the&s;e near Cambahee, lieutenant colonel John Laurens,

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE United States afforded few great events in the year 1782. Tho&s;e which took place in Eu|rope and in the We&s;t Indies, in which the powers in|volved in the American war were concerned, come now to be related.</P>
<P>Britain was at this time attacked in every quarter where &s;he had foreign po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and the combination again&s;t her was &s;o great, that the i&s;land of Mi|norea was left to its fate. After a te|dious &s;iege it &s;urrendered to the com|bined armies of France and Spain,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Feb.</HI> 5.</NOTE> un|der the command of the duke de Crillon in the &s;ervice
<PB N="387" REF="028963_0367_0FDDC013A21069C8">of his mo&s;t Catholic maje&s;ty. About the &s;ame time the &s;ettlements of Demarara and E&s;&s;iquibo, which in the preceding year had been taken by the Briti&s;h, were taken from them by the French. The marquis de Bouille added to the &s;plendour of his former fame the reduction of St. Eu&s;tatius and St. Kitts; the form|er at the clo&s;e of the year 1781, and the latter early in the year 1782. The i&s;lands of Nevis and Mon&s;er|rat likewi&s;e fell into the hands of the French, who were at this time firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed in the We&s;t Indies. Their land and naval force was very formidable. The monarchies of France and Spain had never before &s;o prodigious an armament in that quarter. Their com|bined navies amounted to &s;ixty &s;ail of the line, be&s;ides a va&s;t multitude of frigates and armed ve&s;&s;els. With this force they expected to reduce a great part of the Briti&s;h i&s;lands.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Briti&s;h mini&s;try &s;ent a &s;quadron under the command of admiral Rodney for the pro|tection of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in that quarter. After Rodney had formed a junction with &s;ir Samuel Hood's &s;quadron, and received an addition of three &s;hips from Britain, his force amounted only to thirty &s;ix &s;ail of the line.</P>
<P>It was the de&s;ign of count de Gra&s;&s;e, who command|ed the French fleet at Martinique amounting to 34 &s;ail of the line, to proceed to Hi&s;paniola and join the Spani&s;h admiral Don Solano, who with &s;ixteen &s;hips of the line and a con&s;iderable land force was waiting for his arrival, and to make in concert with him an attack on Jamaica.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h admiral wi&s;hed to prevent this junction, or at lea&s;t to force an engagement before it was effected.
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>April</HI> 8.</NOTE> Admiral Rodney came up with count de Gra&s;&s;e, &s;oon after he had &s;et out to join the Spani&s;h fleet at Hi&s;paniola.

There was no apparent &s;uperiority on either &s;ide till between twelve and one o'clock, when admiral Rodney broke the French line of battle, by bearing down upon their cen|tre, and penetrating through it. The land forces, de&s;|tined for the expedition again&s;t Jamaica, amounting to 5,500 men, were di&s;tributed on board the French fleet. Their &s;hips were therefore &s;o crowded, that the &s;laugh|ter on board was prodigious. The battle was fought on both &s;ides with equal &s;pirit, but with a very une|qual i&s;&s;ue. The French, for near a century, had not in any naval engagement been &s;o completely wor&s;ted. Their fleet was little le&s;s than ruined. Upwards of 400 men were killed on board one of their &s;hips, and the whole number of their killed and wounded amounted by computation to 3,000 killed and 6,000 wounded; while the lo&s;s of the Briti&s;h did not much exceed 1,100 men. The French lo&s;t in this action, and the &s;ub&s;e|quent pur&s;uit, eight &s;hips of the line. On board the captured &s;hips was the money for the payment of the troops, the whole train of artillery, with the battering cannon and travelling carriages, intended for the ex|pedition again&s;t Jamaica. One of them was the Ville de Paris, &s;o called from the city of Paris having built her at its own expen&s;e, and made a pre&s;ent of her to the king. She had co&s;t four millions of livres, and was e&s;teemed the mo&s;t magnificent &s;hip in France; &s;he carried 110 guns, and had on board 1,300 men. This was truly an unfortunate day to count de Gra&s;&s;e. Though his behaviour throughout the whole action
<PB N="389" REF="028963_0368_0FDDC01578A9AD20">was firm and intrepid, and his re&s;i&s;tance continued till he and two more were the only men left &s;tanding up|on the upper deck, he was at la&s;t obliged to &s;trike. It was no &s;mall addition to his misfortunes that he was on the point of forming a junction, which would have &s;et him above all danger. Had this taken place, the whole Briti&s;h naval power in the We&s;t Indies, on principles of ordinary calculation, would have been in&s;ufficient to have prevented him from car|rying into effect &s;chemes of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive con|&s;equence.</P>
<P>The &s;hips of the defeated fleet fled in a variety of directions. Twenty three or twenty four fail made the be&s;t of their way to Cape Francois. This was all that remained in a body of that fleet which was lately &s;o formidable. By this &s;ignal victory, the de&s;igns of France and Spain were fru&s;trated. No farther en|terpri&s;es were undertaken again&s;t the fleets or po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions of Great Britain in the We&s;t Indies, and &s;uch mea&s;ures only were embraced, as &s;eemed requi&s;ite for the purpo&s;es of &s;afety. When the news of admiral Rodney's victory reached Great Britain, a general joy was diffu&s;ed over the nation. Before there had been much de&s;pondency. Their lo&s;&s;es in the Che&s;apeak and in the We&s;t Indies, together with the increa&s;ing number of their enemies, had depre&s;&s;ed the &s;pirits of the great body of the people; but the advantages gained on the 12th of April, placed them on high ground, either for ending or pro&s;ecuting the war. It was fortunate for the Americans, that this &s;ucce&s;s of the Briti&s;h was po&s;terior to their lo&s;s in Virginia. It &s;o elevated the &s;pirits of Britain, and &s;o depre&s;&s;ed the hopes of France, that had it taken place prior to the &s;urrender of lord Cornwallis, that event would have been le&s;s influential in di&s;po&s;ing the nation to peace. As the cata&s;trophe of York Town clo&s;ed the national
<PB N="390" REF="028963_0369_0FDDBF939453ACA0">war in North America, &s;o the defeat of de Gra&s;&s;e, in a great mea&s;ure, put a period to ho&s;tilities in the We&s;t Indies.</P>
<P>Other deci&s;ive events &s;oon followed, which di&s;po&s;ed another of the belligerent powers to a pacification. Gibralter, though &s;ucce&s;&s;ively relieved, &s;till continued to be be&s;ieged. The reduction of Minorca in&s;pired the Spani&s;h nation with fre&s;h motives to per&s;everance. The duke de Crillon, who had been recently &s;ucce&s;sful in the &s;iege of Minorca, was appointed to conduct the &s;iege of Gibralter, and it was re&s;olved to employ the whole &s;trength of the Spani&s;h monarchy in &s;econding his operations. No means were neglected, nor ex|pen&s;e &s;pared, that promi&s;ed to forward the views of the be&s;iegers. From the failure of all plans hitherto adopted for effecting the reduction of Gibralter, it was re&s;olved to adopt new ones. Among the various projects for this purpo&s;e, one which had been formed by the Chevalier D'Arcon was deemed the mo&s;t worthy of trial. This was to con&s;truct &s;uch float|ing batteries as could neither be &s;unk nor fired. With this view their bottoms were made of the thicke&s;t timber, and their &s;ides of wood and cork long &s;oaked in water, with a large layer of wet &s;and between.</P>
<P>To prevent the effects of red hot balls, a number of pipes were contrived to carry water through every part of them, and pumps were provided to keep the&s;e con&s;tantly &s;upplied with water. The people on board were to be &s;heltered from the fall of bombs by a cover of rope netting, which was made &s;loping and overlaid with wet hides.</P>
<P>The&s;e floating batteries, ten in number, were made out of the hulls of large ve&s;&s;els, cut down for the purpo&s;e, and carried from 28 to 10 guns each, and were &s;econded by 80 large boats mounted with
<PB N="391" REF="028963_0369_0FDDBF939453ACA0">guns of heavy metal, and al&s;o by a multitude of frigates, &s;hips of force, and &s;ome hundreds of &s;mall craft.</P>
<P>General Elliot, the intrepid defender of Gibralter, was not ignorant that inventions of a peculiar kind were prepared again&s;t him, but knew nothing of their con&s;truction. He neverthele&s;s provided for every cir|cum&s;tance of danger that could be fore&s;een or imagined.
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sept.</HI> 13.</NOTE> The 13th day of September was fixed upon by the be&s;iegers for mak|ing a grand attack, when the new invented machines, with all the united powers of gunpowder and artillery in their highe&s;t &s;tate of improvement, were to be call|ed into action. The combined fleets of France and Spain in the bay of Gibralter amounted to 48 fail of the line. Their batteries were covered with 154 pieces of heavy bra&s;s cannon. The numbers employed by land and &s;ea again&s;t the fortre&s;s were e&s;timated at one hundred thou&s;and men. With this force and by the fire of 300 cannon, mortars, and howitzers, from the adjacent i&s;thmus, it was intended to attack every part of the Briti&s;h works at one and the &s;ame in&s;tant. The &s;urrounding hills were covered with people a&s;|&s;embled to behold the &s;pectacle. The cannonade and bombardment was tremendous. The &s;howers of &s;hot and &s;hells from the land batteries, and the &s;hips of the be&s;iegers, and from the various works of the garri&s;on, exhibited a mo&s;t dreadful &s;cene. Four hundred pieces of the heavie&s;t artillery were playing at the &s;ame mo|ment. The whole penin&s;ula &s;eemed to be over|whelmed in the torrents of fire which were ince&s;&s;ant|ly poured upon it. The Spani&s;h floating batteries for &s;ome time an&s;wered the expectations of their framers. The heavie&s;t &s;hells often rebounded from their tops, while thirty two pound &s;hot made no vi&s;ible impre&s;|&s;ion upon their hulls. For &s;ome hours, the attack
<PB N="392" REF="028963_0370_0FDDC01866AED118">and defence were &s;o equally &s;upported, as &s;carcely to admit any appearance of &s;uperiority on either &s;ide. The con&s;truction of the battering &s;hips was &s;o well calculated for with&s;tanding the combined force of fire and artillery, that they &s;eemed for &s;ome time to bid defiance to the powers of the heavie&s;t ordnance. In the afternoon the effects of hot &s;hot became vi&s;ible. At fir&s;t there was only an appearance of &s;moke, but in the cour&s;e of the night, after the fire of the garri&s;on had continued about 15 hours, two of the floating batteries were in flames, and &s;everal more were vi&s;ibly beginning to kindle. The endeavours of the be&s;iegers were now exclu&s;ively directed to bring off the men from the burning ve&s;&s;els, but in this they were inter|rupted. Captain Curtis who lay ready with 12 gun boats, advanced and fired upon them with &s;uch order and expedition, as to throw them into confu&s;ion before they had fini&s;hed their bu&s;ine&s;s. They fled with their boats, and abandoned to their fate great numbers of their people. The opening of day light di&s;clo&s;ed a mo&s;t dreadful &s;pectacle. Many were &s;een in the mid&s;t of the flames crying out for help, while others were floating upon pieces of timber, expo&s;ed to equal danger from the oppo&s;ite element. The generous humanity of the victors equalled their valour, and was the more honourable, as the exertions of it expo&s;ed them to no le&s;s danger than tho&s;e of active ho&s;tility. In endeavouring to &s;ave the lives of his enemies, cap|tain Curtis nearly lo&s;t his own. While for the mo&s;t benevolent purpo&s;e he was along &s;ide the floating batteries, one of them blew up, and &s;ome heavy pieces of timber fell into his boat and pierced through its bottom. By &s;imilar perilous exertions, near 400 men were &s;aved from inevitable de&s;truction. The exerci&s;e of humanity to an enemy, under &s;uch circum&s;tances of immediate action and impending danger, conferred
<PB N="393" REF="028963_0370_0FDDC01866AED118">more true honour than could be acquired by the mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lendid &s;eries of victories. It in &s;ome degree ob&s;cured <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> impre&s;&s;ion made to the di&s;advantage of human nature, by the madne&s;s of mankind in de&s;troying each other by wa&s;teful wars. The floating batteries were all con&s;umed. The violence of their explo&s;ion was &s;uch, as to bur&s;t open doors and windows at a great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;tance. Soon after the de&s;truction of the floating <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">atteries, lord Howe, with 35 &s;hips of the line, brought &s;o the brave garri&s;on an ample &s;upply of every thing wanted, either for their &s;upport or their defence. This complete relief of Gibralter was the third deci|&s;ive event in the cour&s;e of a twelvemonth, which fa|voured the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of a general peace.</P>
<P>The capture of the Briti&s;h army in Virginia&mdash;the defeat of count de Gra&s;&s;e, and the de&s;truction of the Spani&s;h floating batteries, di&s;po&s;ed all the ho&s;tile pow|ers to a general peace.</P>
<P>It was expected indeed by mo&s;t people in America, and by many in England, that the capture of lord Corn|wallis would in&s;tantly di&s;po&s;e the nation to peace; but the American war was too much the favourite of the mini&s;try to be relinqui&s;hed, without a &s;truggle for its continuance.</P>
<P>The king of Great Britain, in his &s;peech to parlia|ment, after intelligence had arrived of the capitulation of York Town, declared "That he &s;hould not an&s;wer to the tru&s;t committed to the &s;overeign of a free people,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nov.</HI> 17. 1781.</NOTE> if he con&s;ented to &s;acrifice either to his own de&s;ire of peace, or to their temporary ea&s;e and relief, tho&s;e e&s;&s;ential rights and permanent intere&s;ts, upon the maintenance and pre&s;ervation of which the future &s;trength and &s;e|curity of the country mu&s;t forever depend." The de|termined language of this &s;peech pointed to the con|tinuance of the American war. An addre&s;s of thanks,
<PB N="394" REF="028963_0371_0FDDC019D1755088">couched in the u&s;ual &s;tyle, was voted in the hou&s;e of commons by a majority of 131 to 54. In the hou&s;e of lords a &s;imilar addre&s;s was moved for, and, after great debates, a motion for an amendment to the ad|dre&s;s being made by lord Shelburne, the hou&s;e divided, and the amendment was rejected, by a majority of 75 to 31. A &s;hort prote&s;t again&s;t the addre&s;s was enter|ed in the journals of the hou&s;e &s;igned by the duke of Richmond, the marquis of Rockingham, and earl Fitzwilliam, in which they declared, that they diffent|ed, "for rea&s;ons too often urged in vain for the la&s;t &s;even years again&s;t the ruinous pro&s;ecution of the un|ju&s;t war carrying on by his maje&s;ty's mini&s;ters again&s;t the people of North America, and too fatally con|firmed by repeated experience, and the late di&s;grace|ful lo&s;s of a &s;econd army, to &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">and in need of repe|tition.</P>
<P>From the month of November till the month of Feb|ruary the hou&s;e of commons were employed in war<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> debates on the American war. During which time the minority were daily gaining ground, and the min|i&s;try were giving up one point after another. They at fir&s;t con&s;ented that the war &s;hould not be carried on to the &s;ame extent as formerly; then, that there &s;hould be no internal continental war; next, that there &s;hould be no other war than what was nece&s;&s;ary for the de|fence of the po&s;ts already in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and, la&s;t of all, none but again&s;t the French in America.</P>
<P>As this war was made a parilamentary war, by an addre&s;e to the king in February, 1775, it was now no longer &s;o, by an addre&s;s of the mo&s;t numerous hou&s;e, of the &s;ame parliament in February, 1782, for its di&s;con|tinuance. To this addre&s;s his maje&s;ty an&s;wered, "that in pur&s;uance of their advice, he would take &s;uch mea&s;ures as &s;hould appear to him the mo&s;t con|ducive to the re&s;toration of harmony, between Great

The thanks of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ou&s;e were voted for this an&s;wer; but the guarded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nguage thereof, together with other &s;u&s;picious cir|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">um&s;tances, induced general Conway to move another <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;olution, to the following effect: "That the hou&s;e would confider as enemies to his maje&s;ty and the coun|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty, all tho&s;e who &s;hould advi&s;e or by any means at|tempt the farther pro&s;ecution of offen&s;ive war, on the continent of North America, for the purpo&s;e of redu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing the colonies to obedience by force." This re&s;olu|tion, which was carried without a divi&s;ion, and the ad|dre&s;s to which it had reference clo&s;ed the &s;cene of the American war. A complete revolution in the cabinet was effected, March 27th, 1782, under the au&s;plces of the marquis of Rockingham, who was appointed fir&s;t lord of the trea&s;ury. On the decea&s;e of the mar|quis of Rockingham, earl Shelburne was appointed his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. The fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s of the new mini&s;try, com|po&s;ed of members oppo&s;ed to the American war, was the taking mea&s;ures for effectuating a general peace.</P>
<P>The great change in the public mind in Great Brit|ain favourable to American independence took place between November, 1781, and March, 1782. In that interval Mr. Laurens was relea&s;ed from his &s;evere and tedious confinement in the Tower. Before and after his relea&s;e, he had frequent opportunities of demon|&s;trating to per&s;ons in power, that every hope of peace without the acknowledgment of independence was illu|fory. The con&s;tant triumphs of the mini&s;try over ev|ery effort to oppo&s;e them, and their unremitting per|&s;everance to carry on the war with America in de&s;pite of every remon&s;trance at home and calamity abroad, had, until the above period, nearly annihilated all pop|ular clamours on the &s;ubject. It was con&s;idered as an evil which could not be remedied. But the defeat
<PB N="396" REF="028963_0372_0FDDC020B166AAE0">of lord Cornwallis, added to &s;even years experience, convinced the greate&s;t advocates for the American war, that the recognition of the independence of Amer|ica, was an indi&s;pen&s;able preliminary to the termina|tion of a war, from the continuance of which, neither profit nor honour was to be acquired.</P>
<P>On the 5th of May, 1782, fir Guy Carleton arrived at New York, being appointed to the command of the Briti&s;t, troops in America in the room of fir Henry Clinton. Two days after his arrival, he wrote a letter to General Wa&s;hington, acquainting him, that admiral Digby was joined with him&s;elf in a commi&s;&s;ion to treat of peace with the people of America; tran&s;mit|ting to him, at the &s;ame time, &s;ome papers tending to manife&s;t the pacific di&s;po&s;ition of the government and people of Britain towards tho&s;e of America. He al&s;o defired a pa&s;&s;port for Mr. Morgan, who was appointed to tran&s;mit a &s;imilar letter of compliment to the con|gre&s;s. General Wa&s;hington declined &s;igning any pa&s;&s;|port till he had taken the opinion of congre&s;s upon that mea&s;ure; and by them he was directed to refu&s;e any pa&s;&s;port for &s;uch a purpo&s;e. However, another letter was &s;ent to general Wa&s;hington, dated the 2d of Au|gu&s;t, &s;igned by &s;ir Guy Carl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ton and rear-admiral Dig|by in which they informed him, that they were ac|quainted by authority that negociations for a general peace had already commenced at Paris; that Mr. Gren|ville was inve&s;ted with full powers to treat with all the parties at was, and was then at Paris in the execution of his commi&s;&s;ion. They farther informed him, that his Britannic maje&s;ty, in order to remove all ob&s;tacles to that peace which he &s;o ardently wi&s;hed to re&s;tore, had commanded his mini&s;ters to direct Mr. Grenville, that the independency of the thirteen provinces &s;hould be propo&s;ed by him, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, in&s;tead of making it the condition of a general treaty. But &s;ome
<PB N="397" REF="028963_0372_0FDDC020B166AAE0">jealou&s;ies were entertained by the Americans, that it was the de&s;ign of the Briti&s;h court either to di&s;unite them, or to bring them to treat of a peace &s;eparately from their ally the king of France: they therefore re|&s;olved, that any man, or body of men, who &s;hould pre|&s;ume to make any &s;eparate or partial convention or agreement with the king of Great Britain, or with any commi&s;&s;ioner or commi&s;&s;ioners under the crown of Great Britain, ought to be con&s;idered and treated as open and avowed enemies of the United States of A|merica; and al&s;o that tho&s;e &s;tates could not with pro|priety hold any conference or treaty with any commi&s;|&s;ioners on the part of Great Britain, unle&s;s they &s;hould, as a preliminary thereto, either withdraw their fleets and armies, or el&s;e, in po&s;itive or expre&s;s terms, ac|knowledge the independence of the &s;aid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ates. They likewi&s;e re&s;olved, that any propo&s;itions which might be made by the court of Great Britain, in any manner tending to violate the treaty &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between them and the king of France, ought to be treated with every mark of indignity and contempt.</P>
<P>In the month of June, the town of Savannah and the whole province of Georgia were evacuated by the Briti&s;h troops, as was al&s;o Charle&s;ton, South Carolina, about the clo&s;e of the year. In the mean time, the negociations for peace being continued, provi&s;ional ar|ticles of peace were &s;igned at Paris, on the 30th of No|vember, by the commi&s;&s;ioner of his Britannic maje&s;ty and the American commi&s;&s;ioners, in which his maje&s;ty acknowledged the united colonies of New Hamp&s;hire, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, Rhode I&s;land and Providence Plan|tations, Connecticut, New York, New Jer&s;ey, Penn|&s;ylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Caro|lina, South Carolina, and Georgia, to be "free, &s;ove|reign, and independent &s;tates." They had con&s;tituted them&s;elves &s;uch on the 4th of July, 1776; they had
<PB N="398" REF="028963_0373_0FDDC023C4A5F4E8">been acknowledged &s;uch by the French king on the 30th of January, 1778, when he concluded with them a treaty of amity and commerce; Holland had acknowl|edged them as &s;uch April 19th, 1782; Sweden ac|knowledged them as &s;uch February 5th, 1783; Den|mark the 25th February, Spain in March, and Ru&s;&s;ia in July, the &s;ame year.</P>
<P>The definitive treaty was &s;igned on the 3d of September, 1783; and, on the 25th of November following,

<ARGUMENT>
<P>A general view of the political &s;tate of the Union, until the Federal Government was e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>NO &s;ooner was peace re&s;tored by the definitive treaty, and the Briti&s;h troops withdrawn from the country, than the United States began to experi|ence the defects of their general government. Whil&s;t an enemy was in the country, fear, which had fir&s;t impelled the colonies to a&s;&s;ociate in mutual defence, continued to operate as a band of political union. It gave to the re&s;olutions and recommendations of con|gre&s;s the force of laws, and generally commanded a ready acquie&s;cence on the part of the &s;tate legi&s;latures. Articles of confederation and perpetual union had been framed in congre&s;s, and &s;ubmitted to the con&s;ideration of the &s;tates, in the year 1778. Some of the &s;tates immediately acceded to them; but others, which had not unappropriated lands, he&s;itated to &s;ub&s;cribe a com|pact,
<PB N="400" REF="028963_0374_0FDDC02516C1E1C8">which would give an advantage to the &s;tates which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed large tracts of unlocated lands, and were thus capable of a great &s;uperiority in wealth and population. All objections however had been over|come, and by the acce&s;&s;ion of Maryland in March, 1781, the articles of confederation were ratified, as the frame of government for the United States.</P>
<P>The&s;e articles, however, were framed during the rage of war, when a principle of common &s;afety &s;up|plied the place of a coercive power in government; by men who could have had no experience in the art of governing an exten&s;ive country, and under circum|&s;tances the mo&s;t critical and embarra&s;&s;ing. To have offered to the people, at that time, a &s;y&s;tem of gov|ernment armed with the powers nece&s;&s;ary to regulate and control the contending intere&s;ts of thirteen &s;tates, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of millions of people, might have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a jealou&s;y between the &s;tates or in the minds of the people at large, that would have weakened the operations of war, and perhaps have rendered a union impracticable. Hence the numerous defects of the confederation.</P>
<P>On the conclu&s;ion of peace, the&s;e defects began to be felt. Each &s;tate a&s;&s;umed the right of di&s;puting the propriety of the re&s;olutions of congre&s;s, and the intere&s;t of an individual &s;tate was placed in oppo&s;ition to the common intere&s;t of the union. In addition to this &s;ource of divi&s;ion, a jealou&s;y of the powers of congre&s;s began to be excited in the minds of the peo|ple. This jealou&s;y of the privileges of fre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">en had been rou&s;ed by the oppre&s;&s;ive act of the Briti&s;h par|liament; and no &s;ooner had the danger from this quarter cea&s;ed, than the fears of people changed their object, and were turned again&s;t their own rulers.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation there were not wanting men of in|du&s;try and talents, who had been enemies to the rev|olution,
<PB N="401" REF="028963_0374_0FDDC02516C1E1C8">and who embraced the opportunity to multi|ply the apprehen&s;ions of the people and increa&s;e the popular di&s;contents. As &s;oon as the tumults of war had &s;ub&s;ided, an attempt was made to convince the people, that the act of congre&s;s pa&s;&s;ed in 1778, grant|ing to the officers of the army half pay for life, was highly unju&s;t and tyrannical, and that it was but the fir&s;t &s;tep towards the e&s;tabli&s;hment of pen&s;ions and an uncontrollable de&s;poti&s;m. The a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of congre&s;s, pa&s;&s;|ed in 1783, commuting half <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay for life for five years full pay, was de&s;igned to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the apprehen&s;ions of people, and to convince them that this gratuity was intended merely to indemnity the officers for their lo&s;&s;es by the depreciation of the paper currency, and not to e&s;tabli&s;h a precede for the granting of pen|&s;ions. This act however did not &s;atisfy the people, who &s;uppo&s;ed that the officers had been generally indemnified for the lo&s;s of their pay, by the grants made them from time to time by the legi&s;latures of the &s;everal &s;tates. Be&s;ides, the act, whil&s;t it gave five years full pay to the officers, allowed but one year's pay to the privates, a di&s;tinction which had great in|fluence in exciting and continuing the popular fer|ment, and one that turned a large &s;hare of the public rage again&s;t the officers them&s;elves.</P>
<P>During this &s;ituation of affairs, the public odium again&s;t the officers was augmented by another circum|&s;tance. The officers, ju&s;t before the di&s;banding of the army, had formed a &s;ociety, called by the name of the <HI>Cincinnati,</HI> after the Roman Dictator, Cincinnatus. Whatever were the real views of the framers of this in&s;titution, its de&s;ign was generally under&s;tood to be harmle&s;s and honourable. The o&s;ten&s;ible views of the &s;ociety could not however &s;creen it from popular jealou&s;y. The principles on which the &s;ociety was formed, would, it was &s;aid, in proce&s;s of time, orig|inate
<PB N="402" REF="028963_0375_0FDDC0269CE00378">and e&s;tabli&s;h an order of nobility in this country, which would be repugnant to the genius of republican governments, and dangerous to liberty.</P>
<P>The oppo&s;ition to the congre&s;&s;ional acts in favour of the officers and to the order of the Cincinnati, did not ri&s;e to the &s;ame pitch in the other &s;tates as in Connecticut; yet it produced much di&s;turbance in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and &s;ome others. Jealou&s;y of power had been univer&s;ally &s;pread among the people of the United States. The de&s;truction of the old forms of governments, and the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of war, had, in a great mea&s;ure, broken their habits of obedience; their pa&s;&s;ions had been inflamed by the cry of de&s;pot|i&s;m; and like centinels, who had been &s;uddenly &s;ur|pri&s;ed by the approach of an enemy, the ru&s;tling of a leaf was &s;ufficient to give them an alarm. This &s;pirit of jealou&s;y operated with other cau&s;es to relax the en|ergy of federal operations.</P>
<P>When the danger of war had cea&s;ed, and the va&s;t importations of foreign goods had le&s;&s;ened the quantity of circulating &s;pecie, the &s;tates began to be very remi&s;s in &s;urni&s;hing their proportion of monies. The anni|hilation of the credit of the paper bills had totally &s;top|ped their circulation, and the &s;pecie was leaving the country in cargoes, for remittances to Great Britain; &s;till the luxurious habits of the people, contracted du|ring the war, called for new &s;upplies of goods, and pri|vate gratification &s;econded the narrow policy of &s;tate intere&s;t in defeating the operations of the general government.</P>
<P>Thus the revenues of congre&s;s were annually dimin|i&s;hing; &s;ome of the &s;tates wholly neglecting to make provi&s;ion for paying the intere&s;t of the national debt; others making but a partial provi&s;ion, until the &s;canty &s;upplies received from a few of the riche&s;t &s;tates would hardly &s;atisfy the demands of the civil li&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="403" REF="028963_0375_0FDDC0269CE00378">
This weakne&s;s of the federal government, in con|junction with the flood of certificates or public &s;ecu|rities, which congre&s;s could neither fund nor pay, occa&s;ioned them to depreciate to a very incon&s;iderable value. The officers and &s;oldiers of the late army, and tho&s;e who furni&s;hed &s;upplies for public exigencies, were obliged to receive for wages the&s;e certificates, or promi&s;&s;ary notes, which pa&s;&s;ed at a fifth, an eighth, or a tenth of their nominal value; being thus deprived at once of the greate&s;t part of the reward due for their &s;ervices. Some indeed profited by &s;peculations in the&s;e evidences of the public debt; but &s;uch as were under a nece&s;&s;ity of parting with them, were robbed of that &s;upport which they had a right to expect and demand from their countrymen.</P>
<P>Penn&s;ylvania indeed made provi&s;ion for paying the intere&s;t of her debts, both &s;tate and federal; a&s;&s;um|ing her &s;uppo&s;ed proportion of the continental debt, and giving the creditors of her own &s;tate notes in ex|change for tho&s;e of the United States. The re&s;ources of that &s;tate are immen&s;e, but &s;he was not able to make punctual payments, even in a depreciated paper currency.</P>
<P>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, in her zeal to comply fully with the requi&s;itions of congre&s;s, and &s;atisfy the demands of her own creditors, laid a heavy tax upon the people. This was the immediate cau&s;e of the rebellion in that &s;tate, in 1786. But a heavy debt lying on the &s;tate, added to burdens of the &s;ame nature, upon almo&s;t ev|ery corporation within it; a decline, or rather an ex|tinction of public credit; a relaxation and corruption of manners, and a free u&s;e of foreign luxuries; a decay of trade and manufactures, with a prevailing &s;carcity of money; and, above all, individuals involved in debt to each other. The&s;e were the real, though more remote cau&s;es of the in&s;urrection. It was the tax
<PB N="404" REF="028963_0376_0FDDC0671941D200">which the people were required to pay, that cau&s;ed them to feel the evils which we have enumerated&mdash;this called forth all their other grievances; and the fir&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of violence committed, was the burning or de&s;troy|ing of the tax bill. This &s;edition threw the &s;tate into a convul&s;ion which la&s;ted about a year; courts of ju&s;|tice were violently ob&s;tructed; the collection of debts was &s;u&s;pended; and a body of armed troops, under the command of general Lincoln, was employed du|ring the winter of 1786, to di&s;per&s;e the in&s;urgents. Yet &s;o numerous were the latter in the counties of Worce&s;ter, Hamp&s;hire, and Berk&s;hire, and &s;o ob&s;tinate|ly combined to oppo&s;e the execution of law by force, that the governour and council of the &s;tate thought proper not to entru&s;t general Lincoln with military powers, except to act on the defen&s;ive, and to repel force with force, in ca&s;e the in&s;urgents &s;hould attack him. The leaders of the rebels, however, were not men of talents; they were de&s;perate, but without for|titude; and while they were &s;upported with a &s;uperior force, they appeared to be impre&s;&s;ed with that con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt, which awes the mo&s;t daring wretch, and makes him &s;hrink from his purpo&s;e. This ap|pears by the conduct of a large party of the rebels before the magazine at Springfield, where general Shepard, with a &s;mall guard, was &s;tationed to protect the continental &s;tores. The in&s;urgents appeared upon the plain, with a va&s;t &s;uperiority of numbers, but a few &s;hot from the artillery made the multitude retreat in di&s;order, with the lo&s;s of four men. This &s;pirit|ed conduct of general Shepard, with the indu&s;try, per&s;everance and prudent &s;irmne&s;s of general Lincoln, di&s;per&s;ed the rebels, drove the leaders from the &s;tate, and re&s;tored tranquillity. An act of indemnity wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> pa&s;&s;ed in the legi&s;lature for all the in&s;urgen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, except a few of the leaders, on condition they &s;hould become
<PB N="405" REF="028963_0376_0FDDC0671941D200">peaceable &s;ubjects and take the oath of allegiance. The leaders afterwards petitioned for pardon, which, from motives of policy, was granted by the legi&s;|lature.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as ho&s;tilities between Great Britain and A|merica were &s;u&s;pended, the &s;pecie of the country was drained off to pay for foreign goods, the importations of which exceeded all calculation. Within two years from the clo&s;e of the war, <HI>a &s;carcity of money</HI> was the general cry. The merchants found it impo&s;&s;ible to col|lect their debts, and make punctual remittances to their creditors in Great Britain; and the con&s;umers were driven to the nece&s;&s;ity of retrenching their &s;uperflui|ties in living, and of returning to their ancient habits of indu&s;try and economy.</P>
<P>This change was however progre&s;&s;ive and &s;low. In many of the &s;tates which &s;uffered by the numerous debts they had contracted, and by the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of war, the people called aloud for emi&s;&s;ions of paper bills to &s;upply the deficiency of a medium. The depreciation of the continental bills, was a recent example of the ill effects of &s;uch an expedient, and the impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;upporting the credit of paper, was urged by the oppo|&s;ers of the mea&s;ure as a &s;ub&s;tantial argument again&s;t adopting it. But nothing would &s;ilence the popular clamour; and many men of the fir&s;t talents and emi|nence united their voices with that of the populace. Pa|per money had formerly maintained its credit, and been of &s;ingular utility; and pa&s;t experience, notwith&s;tand|ing a change of circum&s;tances, was an argument in its favour that bore down oppo&s;ition in &s;everal of the &s;tates.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the &s;tates were thus endeavouring to repair the lo&s;s of &s;pecie, by empty promi&s;es, and to &s;upport their bu&s;ine&s;s by &s;hadows rather than by reality, the Briti&s;h mini&s;try formed &s;ome commercial regulations
<PB N="406" REF="028963_0377_0FDD5F484BBB4BC0">that deprived them of the profits of their trade to the We&s;t-Indies and Great Britain. Heavy duties were laid upon &s;uch articles as were remitted to the London merchants for their goods; and &s;uch were the duties upon American bottoms, that the &s;tates were almo&s;t wholly deprived of the carrying trade. A prohibition was laid upon the produce of the United States, &s;hip|ped to the Briti&s;h We&s;t India I&s;lands in American built ve&s;&s;els, and in tho&s;e manned by American &s;eamen. The&s;e re&s;trictions fell heavy upon the ea&s;tern &s;tates, which depended much upon &s;hip building for the &s;up|port of their trade; and they materially injured the bu|&s;ine&s;s of the other &s;tates.</P>
<P>Without a union that was able to form and execute a general &s;y&s;tem of commercial regulations, &s;ome of the &s;tates attempted to impo&s;e re&s;traints upon the Brit|i&s;h trade that &s;hould indemnify the merchant for the lo&s;&s;es he had &s;uffered, or induce the Briti&s;h mini&s;try to enter into a commercial treaty and relax the rigour of their navigation laws. The&s;e mea&s;ures however pro|duced nothing but mi&s;chief. The &s;tates did not act in concert, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;traints laid on the trade of one &s;tate operated to throw the bu&s;ine&s;s into the hands of its neighbour. Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, in her zeal to counter|act the effect of the Engli&s;h navigation laws, laid enor|mous duties upon Briti&s;h goods imported into that &s;tate; but the other &s;tates did not adopt a &s;imilar mea&s;|ure; and the lo&s;s of bu&s;ine&s;s &s;oon obliged that &s;tate to repeal or &s;u&s;pend the law. Thus when Penn&s;ylva|nia laid heavy duties on Briti&s;h goods, Delaware and New Jer&s;ey made a number of free ports to encourage the landing of goods within the limits of tho&s;e &s;tates; and the duties in Penn&s;ylvania &s;erved no purpo&s;e, but to create &s;muggling.</P>
<P>Thus divided, the &s;tates began to feel their weak|ne&s;s. Mo&s;t of the legi&s;latures had neglected to comply
<PB N="407" REF="028963_0377_0FDD5F484BBB4BC0">with the requi&s;itions of congre&s;s for furni&s;hing the fed|eral trea&s;ury; the re&s;olves of congre&s;s were di&s;regard|ed; the propo&s;ition for a general impo&s;t to be laid and collected by congre&s;s was negatived fir&s;t by Rhode I&s;l|and, and afterwards by New York. The Briti&s;h troops continued, under pretence of a breach of treaty on the part of America, to hold po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the forts on the frontiers of the &s;tates. Many of the &s;tates individually were infe&s;ted with popular commotions or iniquitous tender laws, whil&s;t the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> were oppre&s;&s;ed with public debts: The certificates or public notes had lo&s;t mo&s;t of their value, and circulated merely as the objects of &s;peculation: Congre&s;s lo&s;t their re&s;pectability, and the United States their credit and importance.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e calamities, a propo&s;ition was made in 1785, in the hou&s;e of delegates in Virginia, to appoint commi&s;&s;ioners, to meet &s;uch as might be ap|pointed in the other &s;tates, who &s;hould form a &s;y&s;tem of commercial regulations for the United States, and recommend it to the &s;everal legi&s;latures for adop|tion.</P>
<P>Accordingly, &s;everal of the &s;tates appointed commi&s;|&s;ioners who met at Annapolis in the &s;ummer of 1786, to con&s;ult what mea&s;ures &s;hould be taken to unite the &s;tates in &s;ome general and efficient commercial &s;y&s;tem. But as the &s;tates were not all repre&s;ented, and the pow|ers of the commi&s;&s;ioners were, in their opinion, too limited to propo&s;e a &s;y&s;tem of regulations adequate to the purpo&s;es of government, they agreed to recommend a general convention to be held at Philadelphia the next year, with powers to frame a general plan of gov|ernment for the United States. This mea&s;ure appear|ed to the commi&s;&s;ioners ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. The old confederation was e&s;&s;entially defective. It was de&s;ti|tute of almo&s;t every principle nece&s;&s;ary to give effect
<PB N="408" REF="028963_0378_0FDDC02E13AAF920">to legi&s;lation. It was defective in the article of legi&s;la|ting over &s;tates in&s;tead of individuals. It was al&s;o de&s;ti|tute of a &s;anction to its laws. When re&s;olutions were pa&s;&s;ed in congre&s;s, there was no power to compel obedi|ence by fine, by &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of privileges, or other means. It was al&s;o de&s;titute of a guarantee for the &s;tate govern|ments. Had one &s;tate been invaded by its neighbour, the union was not con&s;titutionally bound to a&s;&s;i&s;t in re|pelling the inva&s;ion, and &s;upporting the con&s;titution of the invaded &s;tate. The confederation was farther de|ficient in the principle of apportioning the quotas of money to be furni&s;hed by each &s;tate; in a want of power to form commercial laws, and to rai&s;e troops for the defence and &s;ecurity of the union; in the equal &s;uffrage of the &s;tates, which placed Rhode I&s;land on a footing in congre&s;s with Virginia; and, to crown all the defects, the want of a judiciary power, to define the laws of the Union, and to reconcile the contradictory deci&s;ions of a number of independent judicatories.</P>
<P>The&s;e and many inferior defects were obvious to the commi&s;&s;ioners, and therefore they urged a general convention, with powers to form and offer to the con|&s;ideration of the &s;tates, a &s;y&s;tem of general govern|ment that &s;hould be le&s;s exceptionable. Accordingly in May, 1787, delegates from all the &s;tates, except Rhode I&s;land, a&s;&s;embled at Philadelphia, and cho&s;e general Wa&s;hington for their pre&s;ident. After four months deliberation, in which the cla&s;hing intere&s;ts of the &s;everal &s;tates appeared in all their force, the con|vention agreed to recommend the plan of federal gov|ernment.</P>
<P>From the moment the proceedings of the general convention at Philadelphia tran&s;pired, the public mind was exceedingly agitated, and &s;u&s;pended between hope and fear, until nine &s;tates had ratified their plan of a fed|eral

<P>On the ratification in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, the citizens of Bo&s;ton, in the elevation of their joy, formed a proce&s;|&s;ion in honour of the happy event, which was novel, &s;plendid, and magnificent. This example was after|wards followed, and in &s;ome in&s;tances improved upon, in Baltimore, Charle&s;ton, Philadelphia, New Haven, Port&s;mouth and New York, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. Nothing could equal the beauty and grandeur of the&s;e ex|hibitions. A &s;hip was mounted upon wheels, and drawn through the &s;treets; mechanics erected &s;tages, and exhibited &s;pecimens of labour in their &s;everal oc|cupations, as they moved along the road; flags, with emblems de&s;criptive of all the arts and of the Federal Union, were invented and di&s;played in honour of the government. Multitudes of all ranks in life a&s;&s;embled to view the &s;plendid &s;cenes; whil&s;t &s;obriety, joy and harmony marked the brilliant exhibitions, by which
<PB N="410" REF="028963_0379_0FDDC0307A088970">the Americans celebrated the e&s;tabli&s;hment of their empire.</P>
<P>On the 3d of March, 1789, the delegates from the eleven &s;tates, which at that time had ratified the con&s;ti|tution, a&s;&s;embled at New York, where a convenient and elegant building had been prepared for their ac|commodation. On opening and counting the votes for pre&s;ident, it was found that GEORGE WASHING|TON was <HI>unanimou&s;ly</HI> elected to that dignified office, and that JOHN ADAMS was cho&s;en vice pre&s;ident. The annunciation of the choice of the fir&s;t and &s;econd magi&s;trates of the United States, occa&s;ioned a general diffu&s;ion of joy among the friends to the Union, and fully evinced that the&s;e eminent characters were the choice of the people.</P>
<P>On the 30th of April, 1789, GEORGE WASHINGTON was inaugurated PRESIDENT of the United States of America, in the city of New York. The ceremony was performed in the open gallery of Federal Hall, in the view of many thou&s;and &s;pectators. The oath was admini&s;tered by chancellor Living&s;ton. Several circum&s;tances concurred to render the &s;cene unu&s;ually &s;olemn&mdash;the pre&s;ence of the beloved FATHER and DELIVERER of his country&mdash;the impre&s;&s;ions of grati|tude for his pa&s;t &s;ervices&mdash;the va&s;t concour&s;e of &s;pec|tators&mdash;the devout fervency with which he repeated the oath, and the reverential manner in which he bow|ed to ki&s;s the &s;acred volume&mdash;The&s;e circum&s;tances, together with that of his being cho&s;en to the mo&s;t dignified office in America, and perhaps in the world, by the unanimous voice of more than three millions of enlightened freemen,&mdash;all con&s;pired to place this among the mo&s;t augu&s;t and intere&s;ting &s;cenes which have ever been exhibited on this globe.</P>
