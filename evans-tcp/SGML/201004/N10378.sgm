<P>THE evils which we have long fore&s;een are now come upon this town and province, the long meditated &s;troke is now given to the civil liberty of this country? How long we may be allowed the enjoyment of our religious liberty is a que&s;tion of infinite moment. Religion can never be retained in it's purity where tyranny has u&s;urped the place of rea&s;on and ju&s;tice. The bill for blocking up the harbour of Bo&s;ton is replete with inju&s;tice and cruelty, thou&s;ands of innocent men, be&s;ides women and infants, are by it reduced to indegence and di&s;tre&s;s; and though we in this town more immediately feel this di&s;tre&s;s, yet our brethren in the other towns of this province, and all the other colonies, mu&s;t &s;ee that we &s;uffer in the common cau&s;e, and that <HI>they</HI> them&s;elves mu&s;t &s;oon realize the &s;uffer|ings under which <HI>we</HI> now labour, if no means are di&s;covered for our re|lief. But if any &s;hould think that this town alone is to groan under the weight of arbitrary power, we are now furni&s;hed by our enemies, with a &s;till more glaring evidence of a fixed plan of the Briti&s;h admini&s;tration to bring the whole continent into the mo&s;t humiliating bondage. A bill has been brought into parliament apparently for the purpo&s;e of taking away our charter rights, wherein it is to be enacted that the coun&s;ellors &s;hall be appointed by mandamus from the king, that our ju&s;tices of the &s;uperior court, ju&s;tices of our inferior courts, and ju&s;tices of the peace, &s;hall be all appointed by the governor alone, without the advice of the council, and all of them, excepting the ju&s;tices of the &s;uperior court be removeable by him at his plea&s;ure, that our juries &s;hall not be cho&s;en by the freeholders, as they heretofore have been, but by the &s;heriff of the county, and that this &s;heriff &s;hall not be appointed by the gover|nor and council as heretofore, but by the governor alone, &s;o that our lives and properties are to be decided upon by judges appointed by the governor alone, and by juries cho&s;en by a &s;heriff who mu&s;t be en|tirely under the influence of the governor as he is appointed by him, and is removeable by him alone, whenever he &s;hall di&s;cover a reluctance to conform to the will of the governor. Surely if we &s;uffer the&s;e things we are the mo&s;t abject &s;laves. If a favorite of a perver&s;e governor &s;hould pretend a title to our lands, or any other part of our property, we need no doubt but a very &s;mall degree of evidence in &s;upport of the claim, would be judged &s;ufficient, e&s;pecially as the bill makes provi&s;ion, that upon the mo|tion of either of the parties, it &s;hall be lawful to try the cau&s;e in another coun|ty than that in which the action was brought, &s;o that a man is to be car|ried into a di&s;tant part of the province, in&s;tead of having his cau&s;e tried in his own county, and to be tried by &s;trangers with whom the good or bad characters of the parties or of the witne&s;&s;es can have no weight, con|trary to the very &s;pirit of magna charta. Of what value are our lands or e&s;tates to us, if &s;uch an odious government &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed among us? Can we look with plea&s;ure on the inheritance left by our ance&s;tors, or on the fields cultivated by <HI>our</HI> indu&s;try? When we reflect that all our labours have made them only a more inviting prey to our enemies, will not the vine-yard of Naboth be ever in <HI>our</HI> minds? But le&s;t any thing &s;hould be wanting to compleat our mi&s;ery, another bill is al&s;o prepared, which enables the governor to &s;ave any per&s;on or per&s;ons, who, under
<PB REF="013157_0002_0F8FF97A1B1E0058" MS="y">the pretext of &s;upporting or carrying into execution the late or other acts of the Briti&s;h parliament, &s;hall murder and de&s;troy the people of this country, from being tried in this province (even if they &s;hould be indict|ed by &s;uch grand jurors as &s;hall be cho&s;en by the &s;heriff of the county in the &s;ame manner that we have mentioned that petty jurors are to be returned) but the per&s;on indicted with &s;uch witne&s;&s;es as he and the pro|&s;ecutor (which will be the crown) &s;hall judge proper, &s;hall be &s;ent to either of the other colonies, or even to Great Britain, to be tried for mur|dering the inhabitants of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay. And provi&s;ion is al&s;o made to prevent our meeting together in our corporate capacity as a town, unle&s;s it be once in the month of March for the election of the town officers, except the matter or bu&s;ine&s;s of the meeting is laid before the governor, and his leave in writing is obtained for a meeting of the town.</P>
<P>There is but one way that we can conceive of, to prevent what is to be deprecated by all good men, and ought by all po&s;&s;ible means to be pre|vented, <HI>viz,</HI> The horrors that mu&s;t follow an open rupture between Great Britain and her colonies; or on our part, a &s;ubjection to ab&s;olute &s;la|very: And that is by affecting the trade and intere&s;t of Great Britain, &s;o deeply as &s;hall induce her to withdraw her oppre&s;&s;ive hand. There can be no doubt of our &s;ucceeding to the utmo&s;t of our wi&s;hes if we univer|&s;ally come into a &s;olemn league, not to import goods from Great Britain, and not to buy any goods that &s;hall hereafter be imported from thence, until our grievances &s;hall be redre&s;&s;ed. To the&s;e, or even to the lea&s;t of the&s;e &s;hameful impo&s;itions, we tru&s;t in God, our countrymen never will &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>We have received &s;uch a&s;&s;urances from our brethren in every part of the province of their readine&s;s to adopt &s;uch mea&s;ures as may be likely to &s;ave our country, that we have not the lea&s;t doubt of an almo&s;t univer&s;al agreement for this purpo&s;e; in confidence of this, we have drawn up a form of a covenant to be &s;ub&s;cribed by all adult per&s;ons of both &s;exes; which we have &s;ent to every town in the province, and that we might not give our enemies time to counteract us, we have endeavoured that every town &s;hould be furni&s;hed with &s;uch a copy on or before the fourteenth day of this month, and we earne&s;tly de&s;ire that you would u&s;e your utmo&s;t en|deavours that the &s;ub&s;cription paper may be filled up as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, that &s;o they who are in expectation of overthrowing our liberties may be di&s;couraged from pro&s;ecuting their wicked de&s;igns; as we look upon this the la&s;t and only method of pre&s;erving our land from &s;lavery with|out drenching it in blood, may God pro&s;per every undertaking which tends to the &s;alvation of his people. We are, &amp;c.</P>
