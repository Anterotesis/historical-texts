<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>TWO motives, principally, have induced me to pub|li&s;h the following di&s;cour&s;e; the one is, that tho&s;e who di&s;approved of certain parts may have an opportunity of giving them a &s;econd and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate con&s;ideration; the other is, that the &s;entiments advanced appear to me highly &s;ea&s;onable, and ought to be diffu&s;ed as exten&s;ively as po&s;&s;ible. The di&s;cour&s;e is printed, <HI>word for word,</HI> as it was written in the fir&s;t copy; and only three &s;en|tences, which will be found marked, were forgotten at the time of delivery. This is mentioned to apologize for the inaccuracies which will occur, and which would have been corrected, had it not been judged be&s;t &s;crupu|lou&s;ly to adhere to the very words, which all who were pre&s;ent can be called to atte&s;t.&mdash;The notes are entirely added.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome general objections which have been made to the di&s;cour&s;e, of which it may be proper here to take a little notice. It has been &s;aid, that the &s;entiments are different from tho&s;e contained in other publications of mine, particularly in the "Signs of the Times."
<PB N="iv" REF="034003_0003_0FF9F42F4609E600">That publication was made in 1794, and is the late&s;t which can be alledged again&s;t me. The &s;cope of that performance I &s;till heartily approve. If, in pro&s;ecuting my main object, I expre&s;&s;ed &s;anguine expectations from the revolution in France, both as to her&s;elf and to the world, thou&s;ands, in all countries, at the time, enter|tained the &s;ame, and have been equally di&s;appointed. If the French nation have departed from their original prin|ciples, I am not obliged to follow them. I will be no advocate for enormities unequalled in the annals of man|kind; for principles which &s;ubvert all religion, morality and order, and which threaten to involve us, with the whole human race, in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion and mi&s;ery. Whatever may be the de&s;igns of God in the&s;e convul|&s;ions, and though they &s;hall certainly be made &s;ub&s;ervi|ent to his glory, yet we mu&s;t not countenance or par|take in the wickedne&s;s of the in&s;truments.</P>
<P>Again; it has been &s;aid, that it is improper to carry polities into the pulpit. This is a &s;aying to which many have no preci&s;e idea affixed. If they mean, that it is improper to di&s;cu&s;s political que&s;tions, and to e&s;pou&s;e a particular party, they have rea&s;on on their &s;ide. But, if they mean, that the love of country, the duty of citi|zens, and obedience to lawful government, have no con|nection with religion, and that a Preacher ought not to inculcate the&s;e, I <HI>have not &s;o learned Chri&s;t.</HI> Reli|gion, morality, and obedience to government, are in&s;e|parably connected. The true chri&s;tian faithfully and con&s;cientiou&s;ly endeavours to per&s;orm all the duties of
<PB N="v" REF="034003_0004_0FF9C971C2EA3F10">his &s;everal &s;tations and relations. The apo&s;tles were not politicians, and yet we find them &s;trongly enjoining the duties which we owe as members of civil &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Again; it has been &s;aid, that the di&s;cour&s;e, admitting that it contains nothing but the truth, is not adapted to the occa&s;ion, and is al&s;o culpable for an imprudent di&s;|play of &s;entiments. As to the charge of un&s;ea&s;onable|ne&s;s, what can be more &s;ea&s;onable, on &s;uch a day, than to point out tho&s;e &s;ins which are the cau&s;e of divine judgments? Were we not called to confe&s;s and for&s;ake the&s;e? Deplorable mu&s;t be our &s;ituation, if we cannot bear even a recital of them. But, why &s;peak &s;o much about France? Becau&s;e the danger from France was the very occa&s;ion of our fa&s;ting; her &s;ins prevail among us; and her mi&s;eries exhibit to us an awfully in&s;tructive le&s;&s;on.</P>
<P>As to imprudence, I have only to &s;ay, that the oc|ca&s;ion &s;eemed to demand great plainne&s;s and faithfulne&s;s. I become more convinced that &s;ilence has been kept too long, and that to per&s;i&s;t in it will be attended with the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences. Our enemies have already gotten too fa&s;t a hold; and they wi&s;h for nothing but to retain us in blindne&s;s and lukewarmne&s;s to accompli&s;h our ruin. The &s;hock which the di&s;cour&s;e, as was to be expected, gave to &s;ome, will eventually prove bene|ficial. I anticipate the time when what is &s;aid will be thought moderate; when I &s;hall be commended rather than cen&s;ured; and I am contented to wait. The views of France are di&s;clo&s;ing daily, and the film removing
<PB N="vi" REF="034003_0005_0FF9F4351AC6A128">from our eyes. If, however, I am mi&s;taken in all this, the charitable will impute the error to the head, and not to the heart, for I have no other intere&s;t than the be&s;t welfare of men. I love my God, I love my country, and I love my enemies.</P>

<HEAD>A <HI>DISCOURSE,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>JOSHUA vii. 13.</BIBL>
<P>Up, &s;anctify the people, and &s;ay, Sanctify your&s;elves again&s;t to-morrow; for thus &s;aith the Lord God of I&s;rael, There is an accur&s;ed thing in the mid&s;t of thee, O I&s;rael: thou can&s;t not &s;tand before thine enemies, until ye take away the accur&s;ed thing from among you.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE &s;lighte&s;t con&s;ideration of the occa&s;ion of the&s;e words, will &s;how that they are not im|properly cho&s;en as the &s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e on this day. Notwith&s;tanding the expre&s;s command of God to the children of I&s;rael, to &s;ave nothing for their own u&s;e in the de&s;truction of Jericho, a man, named Achan, had taken from <Q>among the &s;poils a goodly Babyloni&s;h garment, and two hundred &s;hekels of &s;ilver, and a wedge of gold of fifty &s;hekels, and hid them in his tent.</Q> When they, afterwards, went up again&s;t Ai, God
<PB N="8" REF="034003_0007_0FF9F4369E254900">manife&s;ted his di&s;plea&s;ure for the di&s;obedience, by &s;uffering their enemies to prevail. This great|ly di&s;couraged the people, and afflicted Jo&s;hua. He humbled him&s;elf before God, and earne&s;tly intreated his interpo&s;ition. Jo&s;hua was then in|formed of the true cau&s;e of the calamity; and that, until reparation was made, the divine a&s;|&s;i&s;tance would be withheld.</P>
<P>Although only one man was particularly charged, yet all are repre&s;ented as having com|mitted a tre&s;pa&s;s, and they &s;hared in the puni&s;h|ment. Others might have been guilty; or, at lea&s;t, have had covetous de&s;ires, or have concealed what was done. But, if neither of the&s;e be ad|mitted, the precedent was extremely dangerous, and the community, of which the individual was a member, were to be con&s;idered as partakers of the &s;in, unle&s;s it was openly di&s;claimed.</P>
<P>The application of the text to our circum|&s;tances as a nation, is natural and ea&s;y. For &s;e|veral years pa&s;t, one calamity has &s;ucceeded an|other, with little intermi&s;&s;ion, or we have been kept in a &s;tate of alarm. Though the cloud has not always bur&s;t, yet it has been continually hanging over us. All who acknowledge the ex|i&s;tence and government of God, mu&s;t believe that the&s;e things befal us by his direction, and
<PB N="9" REF="034003_0008_0FF9F439BB1B06F8">are tokens of his anger. <Q>He doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men.</Q> There is an <HI>accur&s;ed thing</HI> in the mid&s;t of us. Why have we &s;uffered by fires? Becau&s;e of our &s;ins. Why have we fallen by pe&s;tilence? Be|cau&s;e of our &s;ins. Why have we been threatened with war? Becau&s;e of our &s;ins. Without re|formation, an entire removal of judgments is not to be expected. The rod may be taken away for a time, but it will return with double force. Puni&s;hments will follow &s;ins, as &s;ure as ju&s;tice and judgment are the habitation of the eternal throne.</P>
<P>Danger impends, at pre&s;ent, from a quarter of which we had not once the &s;malle&s;t apprehen|&s;ion, and of which we may not yet be &s;ufficiently aware. It was hardly to be conceived, that &s;o di&s;tant as we are from the &s;cene of blood, &s;tudi|ous of peace, and de&s;irous of doing ju&s;tice to all nations, any circum&s;tances &s;hould ari&s;e to involve us. We fondly dreamed, that the mighty cra&s;h of kingdoms would be like thunder heard remote. Lea&s;t of all was it to be &s;u&s;pected, that a nation to whom we were enthu&s;ia&s;tically attached, at who&s;e victories we have rejoiced, who&s;e crimes we have palliated, and who&s;e injuries we have borne, &s;hould meditate our de&s;truction. But, as they
<PB N="10" REF="034003_0009_0FF9C977D7B52EF0">are the in&s;trument, in the hand of God, for cha&s;|ti&s;ing the inhabitants of the old world for their iniquities, &s;o they may be likewi&s;e u&s;ed for our correction; or, he may mercifully intend to force us to a di&s;tance from them, to <Q>come out from them, that we be not partakers of their &s;ins, and that we receive not of their plagues.</Q> Though there is rea&s;on to hope, from the u&s;ual di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence, that we are not doomed to ruin, and that we &s;hall not be over|whelmed in the calamities of other nations, yet we may not e&s;cape unpuni&s;hed. Numerous and aggravated as our offences are, we have not <Q>wor|&s;hipped the bea&s;t;</Q> and, rapid as our pro|gre&s;s has been in vice, we have not arrived at that height in which the righteous Governor of the univer&s;e gives command, <Q>to pluck up, and to pull down, and to de&s;troy.</Q></P>
<P>It is a matter, my brethren, of the mo&s;t &s;eri|ous and intere&s;ting inquiry, what tho&s;e &s;ins are, among us, with which God is ju&s;tly di&s;plea&s;ed. To determine on the&s;e, we mu&s;t con&s;ider the &s;ins which abound in the community, are the mo&s;t de&s;tructive of its peace and order, and which have been invariably puni&s;hed. The&s;e appear to be&mdash;the inattention to family in&s;truction and government&mdash;the neglect of the ordinances of
<PB N="11" REF="034003_0010_0FF9F42C10A133C0">divine wor&s;hip, and of the due ob&s;ervance of the Sabbath&mdash;the abu&s;e of temporal pro&s;perity&mdash;the prevalence of infidelity&mdash;and the want of union. Other things might be particularized, but the&s;e are the principal, and more than will admit of a full di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Think not that I unrea&s;onably detain you by remarking, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;peak, on an occa&s;ion like this, &s;o as to &s;atisfy all. If the duty of fa&s;ting and prayer be handled only in ge|neral, &s;ome will blame the Preacher for trim|ming; and he may even fall under the charge of unfaithfulne&s;s. If he touch on public affairs, then &s;ome will &s;ay, that he carries politics into the pulpit, and &s;ides with a party. The be&s;t way is, to pre&s;erve a good con&s;cience; neither to invite unnece&s;&s;arily the re&s;entment of the world, nor to di&s;&s;emble, &s;hould it en&s;ure the riche&s;t fa|vours.</P>
<P>FIRST, The inattention to family in&s;truction and government is an evil we have to deplore. It is a &s;ign of the decay of religion, and has mo&s;t pernicious effects. Were per&s;ons rightly im|pre&s;&s;ed with the importance of divine things, they would be &s;olicitous for the be&s;t welfare of tho&s;e whom Providence has committed to their care. In this re&s;pect, Abraham was a pat|tern.
<PB N="12" REF="034003_0011_0FF9F43B783F8D28">"I know him," &s;aith God, <Q>that he will command his children and his hou&s;hold after him, and they &s;hall keep the way of the Lord, to do ju&s;tice and judgment.</Q> How few, at this day, de&s;erve this glorious te&s;timony! Who copy this illu&s;trious pattern! Many act as though nothing more was required than to give their children human learning, and provide for their advancement to riches or honors: whereas, their happine&s;s, and their &s;ervice to &s;ociety, depend much more on a religious education, and habits of indu&s;try and virtue, than on the fine&s;t talents, and the mo&s;t improved under&s;tandings. What are all human acquirements, without a &s;ound faith to direct? What can parents &s;ub&s;titute as an equivalent for this? <Q>What is a man pro|fited, if he &s;hall gain the whole world, and lo&s;e his own &s;oul?</Q> It is by early in&s;truction in families, the force of good example, and pru|dent di&s;cipline, that per&s;ons are formed to be u&s;eful members in both Church and State. The influence of the&s;e is felt through the whole cour&s;e of life. <Q>Train up a child in the way he &s;hould go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.</Q></P>
<P>On the contrary, when children are permitted to grow up without pious in&s;truction, and to
<PB N="13" REF="034003_0012_0FF9F4416E70E2B0">follow, without re&s;traint, their own inclinations, they are likely to bring di&s;grace upon them&s;elves, and ruin to &s;ociety. The very foundations of order and morality are de&s;troyed. Nor is the evil confined to the generation in which they live, but reaches to &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ones. Who is to teach when all are ignorant? What hope re|mains when the whole ma&s;s is corrupted?</P>
<P>We feel the di&s;mal con&s;equences of our neglect in this country, and, unle&s;s a &s;peedy remedy is applied, mu&s;t feel them yet more &s;everely. To this is greatly to be a&s;cribed tho&s;e dangerous principles, and tho&s;e di&s;&s;olute manners, which prevail. The untutored youth is prone to ad|mit the &s;ugge&s;tions of infidelity, and run into the utmo&s;t licentiou&s;ne&s;s. When his mind is not &s;tored with divine truths, and he is unacquainted with the holy &s;criptures, or the evidence with which they are &s;upported, he is ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to reject their authority. It may be well que&s;|tioned, whether the exclu&s;ion of the bible, as a &s;chool-book, is not highly improper. Children, by learning to read in this, obtain a knowledge of its contents, which they may never otherwi&s;e obtain. Many of its hi&s;torical parts, its para|bles, and its precepts, make an indelible impre&s;|&s;ion upon them.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="034003_0013_0FF9C97DCCE95028">
The importance of a religious education ap|pears from the injunction given to the children of I&s;rael. <Q>The&s;e words, which I command thee this day, &s;hall be in thine heart: and thou &s;halt teach them diligently unto thy children, and &s;halt talk of them when thou fitte&s;t in thine hou&s;e, and when thou walke&s;t by the way, and when thou lie&s;t down, and when thou ri&s;e&s;t up.</Q> The apo&s;tle al&s;o exhorts fathers to <Q>bring their children up in the nurture and ad|monition of the Lord.</Q> The lamentable fai|lure in what has been mentioned, is connected,</P>
<P>SECONDLY, With the neglect of the ordi|nances of divine wor&s;hip, and of the due ob&s;erv|ance of the Sabbath. Many &s;eldom or never pre&s;ent them&s;elves in the hou&s;e of God. The bells which &s;ummon to the place of public devo|tion, &s;eem to be a &s;ignal to them to walk or ride abroad. Such are de&s;titute of the fear of God, and, by their conduct, weaken the bonds of go|vernment. Were they above receiving in&s;truc|tion, or if they thought religion nece&s;&s;ary only to pre&s;erve peace and order, they ought to add the weight of their own example. Legi&s;lators will not govern men by all the laws which they can make, unle&s;s a &s;en&s;e of moral obligation is &s;upported. Little as &s;ome of them may think
<PB N="15" REF="034003_0014_0FF9F44616014D00">of the nece&s;&s;ity of public wor&s;hip, and the con|tempt which they &s;how, it is their &s;ecure&s;t hold and makes men <Q>&s;ubject not only for wrath, but al&s;o for con&s;cience &s;ake.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>The belief of a future &s;tate of retribution is a more powerful re&s;traint again&s;t wickedne&s;s, than any which can be impo&s;ed by hu|man laws. It tends more to overawe the wicked, than all the decrees and ordinances which human legi&s;lators can frame.</Q> <BIBL>Wright on the Nature and Danger of Apo&s;tacy.</BIBL></P>
<P><Q>What avail the be&s;t laws that ever were framed for pre&s;erving order, and &s;ecuring the peace of &s;ociety, if the enforcements of re|ligion are wanting. Laws twi&s;ted about the necks of a corrupt people, will never bind them to duty: they may compel them to eva&s;ions, but they will never con&s;train them to virtue.</Q> <BIBL>Dr. Mu|ter's Sermon.</BIBL></P></NOTE></Q></P>
<P>The complaint which per&s;ons make of a cor|ruption of manners, and of the impatience under lawful government, is idle, while they them&s;elves contribute to the&s;e with all their might. The neglect of public wor&s;hip introduces immorality, which fir&s;t di&s;turbs, and then overturns the State. Some who were once punctual in the duty, mani|fe&s;t a coldne&s;s and indifference; or, if they do attend, have lo&s;t the &s;pirit of practical godline&s;s. Where are mediation, &s;ecret and family prayer, mutual and Chri&s;tian conver&s;e, without which public ordinances are, in a great mea&s;ure, un|profitable, and the attendance upon them de|generates into a lifele&s;s form?<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q>Many of the prevailing vices of the age may be treated to the neglect of public wor&s;hip as their &s;ource. Men &s;hould never forget this great hi&s;torical fact, that the downfal of kingdoms has been always preceded by a neglect of the wor&s;hip of God.</Q> <BIBL>Wright.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="034003_0015_0FF9F4491442CC50">
It cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, that tho&s;e who neglect divine wor&s;hip pay a proper re&s;pect to the Sab|bath. No; many of them &s;pend the time ei|ther in tran&s;acting their worldly bu&s;ine&s;s, or in vain amu&s;ements. They not only omit religious exerci&s;es, but engage in what is a direct profana|tion of the day. Too frequently, even with tho&s;e who profe&s;s to reverence the command of God, are worldly conver&s;ation, criminal indo|lence, and unnece&s;&s;ary vi&s;its, indulged. This is one of the reigning &s;ins, and for which the Lord has a controver&s;y with us.</P>
<P>That this is a &s;in which brings judgments upon a people, is apparent from the dealings of God towards the children of I&s;rael, and his many de|clarations. Their pro&s;perity and adver&s;ity, as a nation, depended on the regard which they paid to the Sabbath. This charge is often brought again&s;t them; <Q>My &s;abbaths they greatly pol|luted.</Q> No le&s;s than three times does it oc|cur in the &s;ame chapter, with a puni&s;hment denounced; <Q>I &s;aid, I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderne&s;s, to con&s;ume them.</Q> It is mentioned as a &s;ign of their de|generacy,
<PB N="17" REF="034003_0016_0FF9F44A98ACC5C0">that they &s;aid, <Q>When will the new moon be gone, that we may &s;ell corn, and the &s;abbath, that we may &s;et forth wheat.</Q></P>
<P>As the profanation of the &s;abbath drew down the divine di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;o, for the &s;anctification of it, ble&s;&s;ings were promi&s;ed. <Q>Ble&s;&s;ed is the man that keepeth the &s;abbath from polluting it.</Q> Again; <Q>If thou turn away thy foot from the &s;abbath, from doing thy plea&s;ure on my holy day; and call the &s;abbath a delight, the holy of the LORD, honorable; and &s;halt honor him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own plea&s;ure, nor &s;peaking thine own words, then &s;halt thou delight thy&s;elf in the LORD, and I will cau&s;e thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob, thy father; for the mouth of the LORD hath &s;poken it.</Q></P>
<P>Who but might have anticipated the growing corruption of that nation, and its fearful calami|ties, which blotted the &s;abbath from the week! which aboli&s;hed all times and forms of religious wor&s;hip! This opened the floodgates of vice, and kindled the anger of the Lord again&s;t them. Not contented with removing &s;uper&s;tition, and correcting abu&s;es, they in&s;idiou&s;ly endeavoured to overturn the Chri&s;tian religion it&s;elf. To &s;ay
<PB N="18" REF="034003_0017_0FF9F450A1F21040">nothing of the mon&s;trous wickedne&s;s, there was an extreme folly in their conduct. Of what ad|vantage their divi&s;ion of time? How vain to imagine that it can long continue, even among them&s;elves; much more, that it will be adopted by others? Their intention was, evidently, to de&s;troy religion; for they knew that while a&s;&s;em|blies were held for wor&s;hip on the &s;abbath, there would be a memorial of Chri&s;t, and a te&s;timony in favour of divine revelation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The conduct of the French rulers cannot be better &s;tated, than in the words of an author (Wright) already quoted. <Q>They ex|pre&s;sly forbade the public wor&s;hip of the God of the univer&s;e. They began with aboli&s;hing the &s;abbath day as a day to be kept holy to the Lord. They ordered the doors of the &s;everal churches to be kept &s;hut on the Lord's day. They ordered the &s;hops to be kept open on that holy day; and they permitted every &s;ort of bu|&s;ine&s;s to be tran&s;acted on the &s;abbath day as on the other days of the week.

The &s;ame attempt to bring the &s;abbath into di&s;credit, has been made, by &s;ome, with us. Publications have appeared for the purpo&s;e of &s;howing, that it is not of divine in&s;titution, and that the ob&s;ervance of it is improper. Different as opinions may be about the utility of a legi&s;|lative act on this &s;ubject, it is certain, that the neglect of the &s;abbath is an evil, in a political view, as it corrupts the morals of men, and ul|timately endangers the peace of &s;ociety. Where-ever a di&s;regard to the &s;abbath becomes univer|&s;al, there can be no religion, no morality, and no &s;afe government.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was to be expected, that &s;o enlightened a &s;tate&s;man, and one who &s;o con&s;tantly enforces religion by his own example, as the worthy Governor of New-York, would not be inattentive to this &s;ubject. In his &s;peech to the legi&s;lature, at the opening of the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, he &s;ays, <Q>There is al&s;o much rea&s;on to regret, that more re&s;pect is not generally paid to the injunctions of the act relative to Sunday.

<P>Though the advocates for a bill on this &s;ubject could not obtain one &s;o &s;trict as they wi&s;hed, yet one was carried re&s;training certain immoralities.</P></NOTE> Let me mention,</P>
<P>THIRDLY, That we have abu&s;ed our tem|poral pro&s;perity. Since the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the new con&s;titution, the pro&s;perity of this country has been rapid and unexampled. The neutra|lity,
<PB N="20" REF="034003_0019_0FF9C982628806E0">with re&s;pect to contending powers, which was early taken, the wi&s;dom, the impartiality, and the firmne&s;s of admini&s;tration, have, under the ble&s;&s;ing of heaven, highly advanced us.</P>
<P>But this pro&s;perity has been made the occa|&s;ion of &s;in. We have turned our liberty into licentiou&s;ne&s;s; for the riche&s;t bounties we have repaid ingratitude and di&s;content; we have been &s;eized with the de&s;ire of &s;uddenly ama&s;&s;ing wealth; we have been led into criminal &s;peculation; and &s;ucce&s;s has admini&s;tered to our luxury and our plea&s;ures. The expen&s;ivene&s;s of public build|ings, the variety of amu&s;ements, and the &s;tyle of living, are far beyond what &s;implicity, &s;obriety, and prudence, ought to have dictated. We have cleaved to the gifts, and forgotten the giver; we have u&s;ed them as our own, and not improved them for his glory; we have acted as though we were to continue here always, and there was no future &s;tate of account.</P>
<P>The almighty Rule, by his pre&s;ent di&s;pen&s;a|tions, gives us a &s;alutary check, teaches us to feel and acknowledge his &s;uperintending providence, and the obligations which we owe him. Long continued pro&s;perity is dangerous both to indi|viduals and &s;ocieties. <Q>Je&s;hurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art grown
<PB N="21" REF="034003_0020_0FF9F45403CB2D18">thick, thou art covered with fatne&s;s: then he for&s;ook God which made him, and lightly e&s;teemed the Rock of his &s;alvation.</Q> I ha&s;ten to &s;ay,</P>
<P>IN THE FOURTH PLACE, That the preva|lence of infidelity is a cau&s;e of divine judgments. Not many years ago, a profe&s;&s;ed dei&s;t, in this country, was rare. If any doubted, they were a&s;hamed to avow it, and they had &s;o much de|cency as not to ridicule what the generality of mankind held &s;acred. But infidelity is now no longer concealed. Its advocates are numerous, and propagate their &s;entiments with a brazen front. Formerly, &s;ome of the mo&s;t celebrated infidels attacked the Chri&s;tian religion indirectly; but we have &s;een it repre&s;ented as a fable not even <HI>cunningly</HI> devi&s;ed, as de&s;tructive of morality, and the &s;ource of innumerable mi&s;eries. We have &s;een it loaded with all manner of reproach, and a bold attempt made to eradicate it from the earth. From an American pre&s;s have i&s;&s;ued the mo&s;t horrid bla&s;phemies which have ever been uttered. From an American pre&s;s i&s;&s;ued the fir&s;t part of the "Age of Rea&s;on;" and the &s;e|cond part was re-printed here; a multitude of copies were imported, and circulated with un|common indu&s;try. Surely, if our ports be &s;hut,
<PB N="22" REF="034003_0021_0FF9F45A163FC530">it &s;hould be again&s;t &s;uch principles as the&s;e. Were it po&s;&s;ible to lay an embargo on them in the country from which they come, it ought to be done; for they are infinitely more to be dreaded than all the fleets and armies of Europe.</P>
<P>Perhaps we may date the growth of infidelity among us, from the entrance of the French army. While they brought us the a&s;&s;i&s;tance we de&s;ired, and accelerated our independence, they leavened us with ungodline&s;s; and it may yet be &s;aid of us, <Q>The &s;trength of Pharaoh &s;hall be your &s;hame, and the tru&s;t in the &s;hadow of Egypt your confu&s;ion.</Q> Dei&s;m and athei&s;m have long been propagated among that people, and at their revolution appeared in full maturity. Their very Clergy, the profe&s;&s;ed Mini&s;ters of the religion of Chri&s;t, headed by the Archbi&s;hop of Paris, came before the National Convention, and abjured the Chri&s;tian religion, declaring that they con&s;idered it as an impo&s;ture. What el&s;e but horrid deeds were to be expected from tho&s;e who gloried in the confe&s;&s;ion of their hypocri&s;y? What confidence can be placed in tho&s;e who defy the Maje&s;ty of heaven and earth?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is not intended, by any thing in this paragraph, to condemn the alliance with France, or to detract from the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which &s;he afforded. Due credit and gratitude are acknowledged here, and in other parts of the di&s;cour&s;e. But the alliance may, notwith&s;tanding, by an unrea&s;onable partiality on our part, by an exaltation of France in the &s;tead of God, and by evil communication, prove the mean of the greate&s;t injury to us. As to the opinion, that the growth of in|fidelity was promoted by the French army, it is my own; and I have expre&s;&s;ed it with diffidence. I think that &s;ome influence is to be a&s;cribed to them. The French officers had drank deep of a vain philo&s;ophy; and I remember to have heard it &s;aid, that they were generally mathematicians and dei&s;ts.&mdash;The alarming prevalence of infidelity in France is atte&s;ted in the fulle&s;t manner. Let me quote only the words of a late writer. <Q>On the 19th of November, 1793, the Archbi&s;hop of Paris came to the bar of the a&s;&s;embly, accom|panied by his Vicar and eleven other Clergymen, who there re|nounced their Chri&s;tianity and their clerical vows; acknowledging that they had played the villain for many year again&s;t their con|&s;ciences, teaching what they knew to be a lie, and were now re|&s;olved to be hone&s;t men.</Q> Note, p. 280, Philadelphia edition, of a book entitled, <Q>Proofs of a Con&s;piracy again&s;t all the Religions and Governments of Europe, carried on in the &s;ecret meetings of Free-Ma&s;ons, Illuminati, and Reading Societies. Collected from good Authorities, by John Robi&s;on, A. M. Profe&s;&s;or of Natural Philo&s;ophy, and Secretary to the Royal Society of Edinburgh.</Q> This book is now re-printing, by Mr. George Forman, in this city, and de&s;erves the highe&s;t attention. It di&s;plays an a&s;toni&s;hing &s;cene of wickedne&s;s, and is peculiarly calculated to open the eyes of all on tho&s;e horrid principles which have been &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly propagated in Eu|rope, have &s;o deeply penetrated the French nation, hurried them into their exce&s;&s;es, and plunged them into their mi&s;eries.</NOTE></P>

There is, however, a more clo&s;e alliance be|tween the principles of infidelity and the over|throw of government than many apprehend. How are we to account for the fact, that many of tho&s;e who blu&s;ter about the mal-conduct of men in office, are avowed unbelievers? It is not meant to alledge, that all who are wild with fal&s;e notions of liberty are in this cla&s;s; or that none of the friends of tyranny are liable to the

There is a connec|tion between the two, and it is well under&s;tood by &s;ome of the&s;e men. It has been practi&s;ed upon us. What was the main object of a pub|lication already mentioned? Be&s;ides the indul|gence of a ridiculous vanity, it was to produce a revolution; and it would have infallibly done this, had the principles pervaded the bulk of the citizens. This happy nation would now have been in the &s;ame un&s;ettled, confu&s;ed, and mi|&s;erable &s;tate of France.

When we &s;ee &s;o much ignorance, mi&s;repre&s;entation, and fal&s;e|hood, employed by a per&s;on again&s;t the holy &s;crip|tures, we may well &s;u&s;pect his political creed, and cannot &s;afely re&s;ign our&s;elves to his direction.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I &s;ee nothing in this paragraph which I wi&s;h to retract.

The con|duct of &s;ome &s;erious profe&s;&s;ors of religion is accounted for on other principles. To &s;how that what I have &s;tated is the ca&s;e abroad as well as at home, hear the words of Dr. Wat&s;on, Bi&s;hop of Landaff, in his late elegant and animated <Q>Addre&s;s to the People of Great-Britain. "It is here &s;uppo&s;ed," &s;ays he, "that the enemies of religion are al&s;o the enemies of government, but this mu&s;t be under&s;tood with &s;ome re&s;triction. There are, it may be &s;aid, many dei&s;ts in this country, who are &s;en&s;ible of the advantages of a regular government, and who would be as unwilling as the mo&s;t orthodox believers in the kingdom, that our own &s;hould be over|turned. This may be true, but it is true al&s;o, that they who wi&s;h to overthrown the government are not only, generally &s;peaking, un|believers them&s;elves, but that they found their hopes of &s;ucce&s;s in the infidelity of the common people.

As to the connection between licentious opi|nions upon religion and upon government, a late writer, who includes the di&s;ciples of Socinus, gives the following account: <Q>We may ex|pect,  &s;ays he, "that they who, denying the nece&s;&s;ity of a propitiatory &s;acrifice, pre&s;ump|tuou&s;ly lay claim to eternal happine&s;s upon the ground of their own merit; and who de|grade the character of the divine Je&s;us into that of mere man, &s;hould endeavour to de&s;troy all &s;uperiority in their fellow-creatures, and &s;eek the gratification of their pride in the abo|lition

<PB N="32" REF="034003_0031_0FF9C98B76059AE8">obtain peace, but what is the effectual re|medy. THE CONTEST IS FOR NATIONAL SO|VEREIGNTY AND INDEPENDENCE. Spirit of &s;eventy-&s;ix, whither art thou fled? Where the &s;pirit that declared, <Q>We never will &s;ubmit to be hewers of wood, or drawers of water, for any mini&s;try and nation in the world.</Q> Did unanimity and vigor once appear in our public councils, our enemies would relinqui&s;h their at|tempt as idle, or, if they did not, would be covered with &s;hame and confu&s;ion. Even the unparalleled conqueror of Italy would have the laurels &s;natched from his brow, and be covered with willows.</P>
<P>War is, indeed, a dreadful calamity. It is ju&s;tifiable on no principle but that of &s;elf-defence. Through the kind interpo&s;ition of Heaven, it was averted, when, a few years ago, it &s;eemed to be at hand. Negociation was &s;ucce&s;sful. Negociation has been tried again&mdash;open&mdash;fair&mdash; and liberal. It has been &s;purned. Money has been demanded, but no &s;ecurity given for peace. Sums have been fixed, but accompanied with a hint, that more would be expected. What a&s;&s;urance that &s;uch rapacity would ever be &s;ati&s;|fied? To hearken to the&s;e claims is di&s;grace, to comply with them is death. Look at Ve|nice,
<PB N="33" REF="034003_0032_0FF9F47189493E38">at Belgium, at Switzerland. Look, above all, at Holland, the country of your ance&s;tors, and if you inherit a drop of blood from tho&s;e brave Dutchmen who, in former years, &s;o nobly a&s;&s;erted their privileges&mdash;Holland, the &s;tore|hou&s;e of the world, the nur&s;ery of arts, learning and religion, has lo&s;t her eminence among the nations. She is dictated to, exhau&s;ted by con|tributions, her youth infected with infidelity, her commerce annihilated, and is little better than a province of France. How is the glory departed &s;ince the admi&s;&s;ion of a foreign ma&s;ter! How ignoble do men become when they willingly &s;toop to oppre&s;&s;ion! They are like a&s;&s;es couch|ing down under their burdens.</P>
<P>I have not &s;pecified among our &s;ins gaming, tipling, profane &s;wearing, railing, lying, and other immoralities. They are the native fruits of ir|religion, and abu&s;ed pro&s;perity. Nor has there been taken into the enumeration, the retention of a multitude of our fellow-creatures in &s;lavery. Be&s;ides, that this could not be &s;o fully &s;tated as it ought, there are many circum&s;tances which forbid it. Prudence may condemn the mo&s;t di&s;tant reference, but con&s;cience remon&s;trates again&s;t an entire &s;ilence We know where we are mo&s;t vulnerable; and melancholy is the tale
<PB N="34" REF="034003_0033_0FF9C9901963C568">of St. Domingo. O thou Judge of the earth! incline us to do all the ju&s;tice we can, and when thou vi&s;ite&s;t <Q>the iniquity of the fathers upon the children,</Q> in wrath remember mercy!</P>
<P>HAVING con&s;idered the &s;ins mo&s;t prevalent among us, let us &s;incerely confe&s;s and for&s;ake them. This is the important duty for which our excellent Pre&s;ident has recommended to us to a&s;&s;emble on this day. He, impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of the &s;ins of the land, &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of deep humiliation; and, from the di&s;tingui&s;hed part he acted in our revolutionary war, knew that our &s;afety depended on the favour and pro|tection of almighty God. How innocent &s;oever we may be in provoking the a&s;&s;aults of men, we have grievou&s;ly tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the divine law. Each of us is addre&s;&s;ed this day in the words of Jo&s;hua to Achan; <Q>My &s;on, give, I pray thee, glory to the Lord God of I&s;rael, and make confe&s;&s;ion unto him.</Q> Let us remember that each, by his per&s;onal &s;ins, adds to the &s;ins of the commu|nity; that the reformation of the one is the re|formation of the other; and that, had we not contributed to the &s;tock of iniquity, the &s;ins of others &s;hould excite our &s;orrow. "Go," &s;aid the Lord, <Q>through the mid&s;t of the city, through the mid&s;t of Jeru&s;alem, and &s;et a mark
<PB N="35" REF="034003_0034_0FF9F4762338B558">upon the foreheads of the men that &s;igh, and that cry, for all the abominations that be done in the mid&s;t thereof.</Q></P>
<P>If we thus turn from the evil of our ways, we will have nothing to fear. The &s;ame God who hath &s;o often and &s;o remarkably interpo&s;ed in our behalf, will again plead our cau&s;e. We live in an eventful period. What will be the i&s;&s;ue as to France her&s;elf, to the other nations in Eu|rope, or as to our&s;elves, is beyond conjecture. We are only a&s;&s;ured, that <Q>the LORD hath his way in the whirlwind and in the &s;torm, and the clouds are the du&s;t of his feet.</Q> We have already &s;een the power of the Church of Rome, if not de&s;troyed, yet receiving its death would. What more de&s;igns of Providence &s;hall be ful|filled by the pre&s;ent convul&s;ions, are unknown. The words of the Lord re&s;pecting A&s;&s;yria are &s;o remarkable as to demand our attention here. <Q>O A&s;&s;yrian, the rood of mine anger, and the &s;taff in their hand is mine indignation. I will &s;end him again&s;t an hypocritical nation, and again&s;t the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the &s;poil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the &s;treets. Howbeit, he meaneth not &s;o, neither doth his heart think &s;o; but it is in his heart
<PB N="36" REF="034003_0035_0FF9F477EA4941A0">to de&s;troy, and cut off nations not a few. Wherefore it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, that when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion, and on Jeru&s;alem, I will puni&s;h the fruit of the &s;tout heart of the king of A&s;|&s;yria, and the glory of his high looks.</Q> What follows is no le&s;s remarkable, and the whole pa&s;|&s;age recorded in I&s;aiah, 10th chapter, from the 5th to the 19th ver&s;e, is full of in&s;truction as to the ways and dealings of Providence towards nations.</P>
<P>Let the children of God tru&s;t and rejoice in him; and let tho&s;e who are living in di&s;obedi|ence &s;peedily make their peace with him, through his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whom he hath <Q>&s;et forth as a propitiation for &s;in.</Q> If, as a people, we are corrupt and vicious, judgments mu&s;t be ex|pected; and if, as individuals, we continue to reject the go&s;pel, future and eternal mi&s;ery mu&s;t be our portion.</P>
<P>Next to the duties which we owe immediately to God, are tho&s;e which we owe to one another, in the &s;upport of the con&s;tituted authorities, and the defence of our civil and religious privileges. Unnatural children we are, if, when that coun|try which holds all that is dear to us is threatened, we do not breathe one &s;pirit, and exert one
<PB N="37" REF="034003_0036_0FF9F47ADDEBF150">&s;trength; if we do not renounce all partialities to this or to the other nation, be they who they will; and if we do not bani&s;h all party di&s;&s;en&s;ions for the name of AMERICAN.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There are &s;ome who alledge, that parties nece&s;&s;arily exi&s;t in all free governments, and that they are of real &s;ervice. Britain is brought as an example. In my opinion the rea&s;oning is delu&s;ive. The government of Britain is an old and e&s;tabli&s;hed one; ours is of re|cent date; the one is monarchical; the other of the popular form. With us, there is much more danger of weakne&s;s than of energy, of anarchy than of tyranny. But whatever may be &s;aid on this, &s;urely there ought to be no parties with re&s;pect to foreign nations. The prevalence of &s;uch a &s;pirit would expo&s;e us to all their intrigues, and finally bring us under their domination. Much is &s;aid about grati|tude to France. It ought to be remembered, that forgivene&s;s of in|juries is equally a part of morals; and that, with re&s;pect to all na|tions, we ought to be, "in war, enemies; in peace, friends."</NOTE></P>
<P>To conclude, Let us earne&s;tly pray that our Coun&s;ellors may be in&s;pired with integrity, wi&s;|dom, firmne&s;s, and unanimity, in the manage|ment of our national affairs; that the de&s;olations of war may &s;oon cea&s;e unto the ends of the earth; that univer&s;al righteou&s;ne&s;s may prevail, and that this tran&s;porting anthem may be &s;ung by all na|tions: <Q>The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Chri&s;t; and he &s;hall reign for ever and ever.</Q></P>
