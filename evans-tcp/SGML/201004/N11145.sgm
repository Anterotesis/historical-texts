<HEAD>THE OLD MAN's GUIDE.</HEAD>
<P>HEALTHFUL old age is the mo&s;t valuable period of human life: Experi|ence has rendered the ancient more able than tho&s;e who have &s;een le&s;s, and felt le&s;s, to conduct them|&s;elves, and their de&s;cendants; and being freed from the empire of the pa&s;&s;ions, they enjoy quiet.</P>
<P>PHILOSOPHY pretends to this condition; but age gives it truly: Whatever our heirs may think, it is worth pre&s;erving; and in that &s;en&s;e I write the pre&s;ent Treati&s;e.</P>
<P>A HUNDRED are cut off by di&s;orders which a re|gular cour&s;e of life might prevent; for one who dies of age, or its unavoidable effects: Many fall by ac|cidents; to one who is fairly called away by na|ture. The purpo&s;e of this Treati&s;e is to direct the means, by which the&s;e accidents may be avoided, and the&s;e di&s;orders timely obviated.</P>
<P>OLD mens di&s;ea&s;es are hard to cure; but they are ea&s;y to prevent. It mu&s;t be a good natural fabric
<PB N="4" REF="014116_0003_0F93006EDB4EB900">which has pre&s;erved it&s;elf &s;o long; and the &s;ame &s;trength may keep it much longer well, under good regulation.</P>
<P>MODERATE diet, and due exerci&s;e, are the be&s;t guardians in all: But in the advanced period here con&s;idered there are two great pre&s;ervatives be&s;ides; the&s;e are Ea&s;e and Chearfulne&s;s: Both are the na|tural offspring of health; and they will continue the ble&s;&s;ing to which they owe their birth.</P>
<P>IT may be expected, I &s;hould now &s;ay, at what period of life the &s;tate of it that we call aged begins, but nature has her&s;elf left this undeterminable. The weakne&s;s and infirmities of age come at different years, in different con&s;titutions: I could at this hour point out a very young man of eighty-&s;even: and the purlieus of Covent-Garden abound with very old men at &s;even-and-twenty: but to &s;peak in general terms, it may be &s;aid, that the period of life, for which we are giving rules and regulations, begins about fifty-eight; tho' the greater infirmities of age do not advance till &s;everal years after.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. HOW A PERSON IN YEARS IS TO KNOW HE IS IN HEALTH.</HEAD>
<P>IT is allowed, we know &s;o little of nothing, as of our&s;elves: It has been &s;aid often of the mind, but it is not le&s;s true of the body. Fancying we have certain di&s;ea&s;es will &s;ometimes bring them up|on us: And there is as great danger in forcing our|&s;elves to believe, again&s;t our feeling, that we are well; when we have &s;ome di&s;order.</P>
<P>TO avoid both, let the elderly man read here, with a free mind. Let him not &s;uppo&s;e, becau&s;e God has ble&s;&s;ed him with long health, he is above the reach of &s;ickne&s;s; nor neglect the care which may conquer, in its beginning, a di&s;ea&s;e that would in the end conquer him. Let him be as ready to acknowledge real di&s;orders, as careful to avoid ima|ginary.</P>
<P>HEALTH con&s;i&s;ts in a good dige&s;tion of the food, and free circulation of the blood. The appetite and the condition of the &s;tomach after eating, will &s;hew the fir&s;t, and the latter may be known be&s;t by the pul&s;e.</P>
<P>THAT old per&s;on's dige&s;tion is always good, who has a &s;harp but not voracious appetite; and who
<PB N="6" REF="014116_0005_0F930075450D1F10">feels no pain nor &s;ickne&s;s after food. To pre&s;erve this, let him be content with &s;omewhat le&s;s than he could eat at every meal: To keep the &s;tomach in order, do not overload it.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t time to feel the pul&s;e is in the morning a little after getting up; and before breakfa&s;t. It &s;hould be a rule never to omit this examination. A con&s;tant and regular attention to the pul&s;e will &s;hew its &s;lighte&s;t variations; and when any &s;uch happen, let care be taken of the health.</P>
<P>THERE are methods of counting the &s;trokes by a watch; but 'tis idle and mechanical: A repeated attention in the plain way is better.</P>
<P>A FREQUENT examination will inform us what is the condition of our pul&s;e in health; and all devia|tions from this, &s;hew or threaten &s;ickne&s;s.</P>
<P>WHILE an old man feels his pul&s;e regular, finds his dige&s;tion good, and with a mind at ea&s;e can take his u&s;ual exerci&s;e freely, he may be certain he is well. We &s;hall tell him how to keep &s;o: and when a fault is &s;een in time, 'tis ea&s;ily remedy'd.</P>
<P>IF the pul&s;e beat too quick and high, the diet mu&s;t be lower; if too &s;low and weak, the food mu&s;t be &s;omewhat richer. This &s;hort direction will prevent half the di&s;ea&s;es of mankind.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. THE MEANS TO PRESERVE A HEALTHFUL STATE IN OLD AGE.</HEAD>
<P>THE di&s;ea&s;es of aged per&s;ons differ, accor|ding to their &s;tate of body, and natural con|&s;titution: the corpulent are in danger of a&s;thmas; the lean of &s;tranguries: Both &s;hould be guarded again&s;t with extreme care; but mo&s;t the fir&s;t, be|cau&s;e many &s;udden deaths have happened from it, that might have been prevented ea&s;ily by a timely care.</P>
<P>THAT care, and all the nece&s;&s;ary help, will be &s;hewn in a &s;eparate chapter on this di&s;ea&s;e. With re&s;pect to &s;uppre&s;&s;ions of urine, be&s;ide all that has been written of Burdock Root, I may add here, that if as much had been known of its virtues but a little while ago, as is now notorious we might &s;ome years longer have enjoyed that excellent man, Peter Col|lin&s;on. Mr. Jo&s;iah Soames, near dying the &s;ame way, was &s;aved by it.</P>
<P>EXERCISE has thro' the younger part of life been very in &s;trumental in pre&s;erving health. When we grow old we cannot u&s;e &s;o much; and we mu&s;t therefore be more careful in our food. That will go off well with motion, which will overload when quiet: That will nouri&s;h while we walk abroad, which, when we &s;tay at home, breeds fevers.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="014116_0007_0F9300766F998818">
WE mu&s;t not make a change of diet violently; for all &s;udden alterations are dangerous. Our &s;trength for exerci&s;e will leave us by degrees; and we mu&s;t reduce our nouri&s;hment accordingly.</P>
<P>OLD men are lea&s;t healthy in winter; therefore they &s;hould then be mo&s;t careful. They are colder than the young, and therefore cold more affects them. They will perceive the cold has hurt them, when they find the pul&s;e weaker and &s;lower than u&s;ual: and they mu&s;t recover the new damage, by more warmth of cloathing and a &s;omewhat richer diet.</P>
<P>IF per&s;piration has been &s;top'd by the cold, and no other ill effect follow, that will be &s;een by the urine being paler, and more in quantity than u&s;ual. In this ca&s;e let flannel be put on carefully: This will &s;oon re&s;tore the per&s;piration, and the urine will return to its due colour, and quantity. And after that let the flannel be carefully left off again.</P>
<P>HEALTH con&s;i&s;ts in the evacuations having all their proper cour&s;e and quantity: and flannel will dimini&s;h one as much as it encrea&s;es another.</P>
<P>No di&s;order is more trouble&s;ome to old men than co&s;tivene&s;s; and the u&s;e of flannel unadvi&s;edly will &s;ometimes occa&s;ion this.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="014116_0008_0F9300771F339838">
A CAREFUL attention to health is the only way to pre&s;erve it; and many things are excellent when properly u&s;ed, which may otherwi&s;e be de&s;tructive.</P>
<P>IF the appetite fail, or wind oppre&s;s the &s;tomach after meals, then take more air and exerci&s;e, and read or &s;tudy le&s;s. Much &s;tudy always hurts dige&s;tion.</P>
<P>THE different &s;ea&s;ons affect per&s;ons in years very greatly, and they &s;hould always be prepared for the changes. The old man is always be&s;t in &s;ummer, and grows more &s;pirited and free from his com|plaints as that period advances toward autumn: Winter we have &s;aid hurts age, for age is cold and dry; and for that very rea&s;on youth feels &s;ummer mo&s;t hurtfully, and are be&s;t in winter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. OF THE FITTEST DIET FOR PERSONS IN YEARS.</HEAD>
<P>LIGHT diet is mo&s;t proper for aged per&s;ons.</P>
<P>BEEF and pork &s;hould be avoided; for the &s;to|mach will rarely be able to dige&s;t the&s;e, when it is not a&s;&s;i&s;ted by good exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>LAMB, veal, pig, chickens, rabbets, and fi&s;h are excellent; and out of the&s;e, if there were no others,
<PB N="10" REF="014116_0009_0F930077E8CDADC0">tolerable management may produce &s;ufficient va|riety.</P>
<P>No aged per&s;on &s;hould eat more than one con&s;i|derable meal of &s;olid food in the day. The &s;tomach will manage a dinner, when breakfa&s;t and &s;upper have been light; otherwi&s;e the load of one meal not being gone off before another is brought in, neither will be dige&s;ted.</P>
<P>DINNER &s;hould not be eaten too early; that the appetite may not be violent for &s;upper: The older we grow, the more our food &s;hould be dimini&s;hed. This was the practice of Hippocrates; and by the ob&s;ervance of it Cornaro lived to his extreme age.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to &s;upper, the lighter it is the bet|ter; though we do not agree with tho&s;e who advi&s;e the omitting that meal entirely. Moderation is the rule of health. They were in the right who decla|red the mi&s;chief of heavy &s;uppers; but the poets have long &s;ince told us what &s;ort of people tho&s;e are, who, in avoiding a fault, ru&s;h into its contrary. There is a medium &s;ure between a heavy &s;upper, and emptine&s;s; and that is be&s;t. Let the old man eat liquids; and of all liquid diets, tho&s;e which are partly compo&s;ed of milk are be&s;t for him.</P>
<P>THE dige&s;tive faculties in an old man are weak; but milk is in a manner ready dige&s;ted. He wants
<PB N="11" REF="014116_0010_0F930078A2E015D8">an ea&s;y nouri&s;hment, and this affords it; without loading the &s;tomach, or oppre&s;&s;ing it during the hours of re&s;t.</P>
<P>ASSES milk is mo&s;t ea&s;y of dige&s;tion: A pint of that, with a &s;mall toa&s;t, eaten two hours before bed time, will be nouri&s;hing; and &s;it ea&s;y on the &s;to|mach. The value of a&s;&s;es milk is its lightne&s;s: that of the cow is richer and heavier. Tho&s;e who u&s;e the latter in the country, &s;hould mix it fir&s;t with an equal quantity of &s;oft water: In London this care is unnece&s;&s;ary, tho&s;e who &s;ell milk do it for them.</P>
<P>THERE are many other methods in which milk is proper: Milk pottage, and thin rice milk will give a change. But &s;ome farther plea&s;ing variety need not be denied. Weak broths, of veal, chicken, or mutton, may be eat occa&s;ionally; and jellies hone&s;t|ly made at home, are proper, &s;afe, and whole&s;ome.</P>
<P>THESE things will an&s;wer the two purpo&s;es of nouri&s;hing and moi&s;tening: for aged per&s;ons are na|turally too dry.</P>
<P>THE breakfa&s;t is not very important. Tho&s;e who eat no &s;upper are too hungry in a morning; and the &s;tomach being loaded with what they take at that time, is the le&s;s able to dige&s;t a dinner. This is the rea&s;on we advi&s;e old per&s;ons to eat &s;uppers of a right
<PB N="12" REF="014116_0011_0F930079619A1CA0">the&s;e take off the too keen edge of the morning's ap|petite; and there will remain ju&s;t &s;o much de&s;ire to eat as will lead them to get a little into the &s;tomach without loading it.</P>
<P>MEN may fa&s;t away their appetite; and their power of dige&s;tion goes with it. The conduct of the appetite regulates the health; and this is a point not enough regarded.</P>
<P>IT is as e&s;&s;ential not to keep the &s;tomach empty, as it is not to overload it. Wind is the con&s;equence of emptine&s;s, and this always di&s;turbs its office. It &s;hould be con&s;tantly kept at its due employment in advanced periods of life; and this by &s;mall quanti|ties of proper food.</P>
<P>THEREFORE breakfa&s;ts are as nece&s;&s;ary as &s;up|pers; only tho&s;e who are troubled with phlegm &s;hould eat le&s;s at this meal than others. A cup of chocolate, not made too &s;trong, is a good breakfa&s;t. Coffee I cannot advi&s;e generally: But the excep|tions again&s;t tea are in a great mea&s;ure groundle&s;s.</P>
<P>IF an elderly per&s;on likes tea, he need not deny it to him&s;elf for breakfa&s;t. Let him u&s;e the plain green &s;ort of &s;ixteen &s;hillings a pound, and make it well; taking care the water boils, and allowing &s;o much tea that it may be of &s;ufficient &s;trength, without &s;tanding too long upon the leaves.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="014116_0012_0F93007A51588D40">
LET him drink three moderate cups, with a little &s;ugar, and a good deal of milk, and take it neither too hot, nor mawki&s;hly cool. Let him eat with it a thin &s;lice of good bread, with a little butter; and he will find all this nouri&s;hing and excellent.</P>
<P>THE virtues of tea thus drank are as con&s;iderable as its bad qualities when ill managed. In this man|ner it &s;trengthens the &s;tomach and a&s;&s;i&s;ts dige&s;tion; it keeps the body from emptine&s;s without loading it; the appetite for dinner will be the better for it; and the dige&s;tion will be al&s;o more perfect. Tea in this quantity is al&s;o &s;ufficient for the great purpo&s;e of diluting; and it refre&s;hes the &s;pirits more than any other liquid.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t drink at meals is malt liquor, not too &s;trong; &s;mall ale is better than table-beer, becau&s;e it will keep to a due time for &s;afe u&s;e.</P>
<P>SOME wine is nece&s;&s;ary to old men; and accor|ding to the con&s;titution, and former manner of life, may be born by &s;ome without inconvenience. Of all wines &s;ack is the be&s;t, if it can be obtained ge|nuine; and the next be&s;t is mountain.</P>
<P>As occa&s;ion &s;hall require, the &s;upper foods here directed may be u&s;ed by way of dinner; and broths may even be nece&s;&s;ary &s;ometimes for breakfa&s;t.
<PB N="14" REF="014116_0013_0F93007C389F50C8">When the &s;tomach cannot dige&s;t &s;olids, the&s;e liquid nouri&s;hments &s;hould &s;upply the place: And when more nouri&s;hing things are wanted, a broth breakfa&s;t is excellent. Vipers are extolled, but 'tis an idle fan|cy: I have found, on repeated trials, broth of veal and chickens is much better.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV. OF THE FOODS PERSONS IN YEARS SHOULD AVOID.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY thing that is heavy and hard of dige&s;|tion mu&s;t be avoided. Tho' vegetables may be thought innocent, too much of them will in &s;ome ca&s;es prove hurtful; and there are certain kinds that &s;hould be let alone entirely.</P>
<P>CARROTS are to be avoided; no weak &s;tomach can dige&s;t them: Turnips are innocent; and par&s;nips are nouri&s;hing.</P>
<P>SALADS &s;hould be &s;hunned: Cabbage, and all its kinds, breed wind; But a&s;paragus is diuretic; and is excellent again&s;t that common old man's complaint, the gravel.</P>
<P>BAD chee&s;e &s;hould be avoided; and there is no|thing wor&s;e than eating too much butter: But very
<PB N="15" REF="014116_0014_0F93007CA26CE590">fine Che&s;hire chee&s;e; of the Parmezan in a &s;mall quantity after other food, are not ami&s;s.</P>
<P>ALL &s;harp-ta&s;ted things, whether in food or drink, are carefully to be &s;hunned. They cannot be neu|tral upon the &s;tomach; and they are much more like|ly to do harm than good.</P>
<P>FRUITS of due ripene&s;s are innocent; and much more good than this may be &s;aid of them: Unripe, they hurt the &s;tomach, and often bring on dangerous cholics.</P>
<P>CUCUMBERS weaken the dige&s;tion; and greatly prevent the natural and nece&s;&s;ary &s;ecretions.</P>
<P>THE pine-apple, the mo&s;t plea&s;ant of all fruits, is one of the mo&s;t dangerous: Its &s;harpne&s;s fleas the mouth, and we know what effect &s;uch a thing mu&s;t have upon the &s;tomach and bowels, when weakened by age. I have known it bring on bloody fluxes, which have been fatal. There are &s;everal kinds of this fruit, &s;omewhat differing in quality; and a per|fect degree of ripene&s;s, in a great mea&s;ure, takes off its wor&s;t effects: But the&s;e are nice di&s;tinctions: He who is wi&s;e will judge as he does of mu&s;hroons; where many are dangerous, avoid all.</P>
<P>BESIDE rejecting things which are hurtful in them|&s;elves, tho&s;e who are in advanced years would be up|on
<PB N="16" REF="014116_0015_0F93007D2E140158">their guard again&s;t all &s;uch as they are not accu&s;|tomed to.</P>
<P>PARTICULAR con&s;titutions will &s;hew unfore&s;een aver&s;ions to peculiar medicines; and it is the &s;ame in foods. Let him who knows what agrees with him, &s;tick to it. Change is always wrong, and it may be hazardous; and 'tis idle to run into the way of dan|ger where there is no advantage.</P>
<P>ALL mixtures of foods upon the &s;tomach are bad; and there is not a greater error in an old per&s;on than to eat of many di&s;hes at one meal. He mu&s;t not de|ceive him&s;elf by arguing that they all are innocent; for two things of known qualities will often, on mix|ing, produce a third that is perfectly different from them both; and the&s;e are dangerous trials in an aged per&s;on's &s;tomach.</P>
<P>RIGHT management in the&s;e articles is nearly as important as a right choice. A regularity of eating is the next care to the &s;electing proper food; and fixing on a right quantity.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. V. OF AIR FOR ELDERLY PERSONS.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING contributes more to health and long life than pure and good air: But by
<PB N="17" REF="014116_0016_0F93007DE8115AD0">by pure we are not to under&s;tand bleak; nor are aged per&s;ons at any time to chu&s;e that kind.</P>
<P>IT is &s;trange &s;o many &s;hould live to a great age in London, where the air has neither of the&s;e characters; where we breathe &s;moke, and the mixt &s;tench of a thou&s;and putrifying &s;ub&s;tances; which cannot eva|porate through the thick and foul atmo&s;phere of the place.</P>
<P>BUT though none will que&s;tion the &s;uperior excel|lence of a clear country air, yet let not him who has attained to a healthy three &s;core and ten in London, think of leaving it, as a way to continue his days to a longer period. They &s;ay u&s;e is &s;econd nature. It really becomes nature it&s;elf; and bad things, to which an old man has been very long accu&s;tomed, are often better than &s;udden changes. It is well known, that many who have reached an uncommon date of life, have peri&s;hed at la&s;t by a ra&s;h alteration in their food; and 'tis certain the air is &s;carce of le&s;s con&s;equence.</P>
<P>HE who would extend the period, and encrea&s;e the healthy condition of his days by a country air, &s;hould begin at an earlier time; when his con&s;titution can better bear the alteration.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="014116_0017_0F93007E9C3786A8">
IN regard to a choice of air, the rea&s;on we declare again&s;t that which is too bleak is plain; for bleak and cold are always found together. Cold air chills the blood; and in old men we want rather to warm it. This &s;harp air is natural at the tops of hills; and &s;uch &s;ituations all old men &s;hould avoid.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, the milde&s;t air of the country is that of vallies, &s;heltered by ri&s;ing grounds: But this is u&s;ually damp; and more mi&s;chief may therefore ari&s;e from it than good.</P>
<P>THE choice re&s;ts &s;olely then upon a gentle a&s;cent; the be&s;t place of all is toward the bottom of a piece of ground, which does not in any part ri&s;e to a very great height; and if there be a running water at the lowe&s;t part, it is &s;o far perfect.</P>
<P>MORE than this &s;hould be con&s;ulted for the coun|try re&s;idence of the aged man, or of any who would live to be aged. The &s;oil is of va&s;t con&s;equence; and &s;o is the expo&s;ure. A clayey bottom mu&s;t be avoided; becau&s;e it is always cold, and the air about it con&s;equently raw and damp. Rains cannot get thro' it, and they lodge till they are evaporated, chilling the ground, and loading the air with their fatal moi&s;ture.</P>
<P>A CLEAN gravel is the be&s;t &s;oil of all. The air over this is always warm, and naturally dry; for rain &s;oaks through it.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="014116_0018_0F93008085AE3D28">
THE north and north-ea&s;t winds are the wor&s;t for old men; therefore let them &s;helter them&s;elves from the&s;e by a proper choice of &s;ituation. Let the de&s;|cent of the ground face the &s;outh-we&s;t; and then the natural ri&s;e behind will keep off the bleak and &s;harp air from the oppo&s;ite quarters. This may be a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed al&s;o by plantations of trees: And thus the true &s;eat of health and plea&s;ure may be e&s;tabli&s;hed, &s;o far as the&s;e great points concern them.</P>
<P>HE is happy who has made &s;uch a choice in time; and he's &s;till happier who finds him&s;elf now in good time to make it. The later &s;uch a re&s;idence is cho|&s;en, the more carefully and gradually mu&s;t the ow|ner accu&s;tom him&s;elf to it: Fir&s;t in &s;ummer, and by degrees; and at times, at other periods of the year. An air thus cho&s;en, will then a&s;&s;i&s;t in all the great articles of health which age wants; appetite, dige&s;|tion, and a free circulation.</P>

No country hou&s;e is without a garden; and the be&s;t part of this will be upon a good &s;mooth gravel walk. Let this be open to the &s;outh-we&s;t, and well defended from the dangerous quarters.

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. OF EXERCISE FOR OLD MEN.</HEAD>
<P>AIR has led us to mention already the fir&s;t of exerci&s;es, which is walking; and for tho&s;e who have &s;trength to indulge them&s;elves in this, there is none better: But feeble limbs, and various
<PB N="21" REF="014116_0020_0F9300820CD022D8">accidents often deny its u&s;e to tho&s;e who mo&s;t of all want motion.</P>
<P>IN this ca&s;e riding on hor&s;eback is the next in ex|cellence; and the fitte&s;t hours of the day mu&s;t be cho&s;en for that in the &s;ame manner as for the other. In &s;evere weather it will be nece&s;&s;ary to ride under &s;helter, and at all times to avoid damp or bleak places.</P>
<P>MANY diver&s;ions afford al&s;o excellent exerci&s;e; bowling is one, but the &s;ame care mu&s;t be taken, that this be done at a proper time.</P>
<P>A CHARIOT may &s;upply the place of an hor&s;e, to &s;uch as are more feeble; and for tho&s;e who are &s;o weak as to find even this too much, there will ari&s;e a great deal of good from being driven along in tho&s;e chairs which are made to run upon gravel walks.</P>
<P>TO &s;uch as are fond of gardening, nothing affords &s;o happy, or &s;o con&s;tant exerci&s;e. We do not mean that they &s;hould dig or weed the ground; but to u&s;e &s;uch employment as will give exerci&s;e without labour; and &s;uch as no hand will &s;o well perform as that of the ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>SUCH are the trimming of &s;hrubs, and flowering plants; the management of e&s;paliers, the removal of &s;eedling flower-roots; the thinning of fruit upon the trees, and the following and overlooking the
<PB N="22" REF="014116_0021_0F930082930629B8">other &s;everal works. Here will at lea&s;t be more, and bri&s;ker walking than would be otherwi&s;e; and in many things the little u&s;e that is made of the hands will complete that exerci&s;e, by continuing it perfectly through the body.</P>
<P>THE only danger in this healthy and happy cour&s;e is, that it is too aluring. Let him who delights in it take an invariable re&s;olution, never to let his fond|ne&s;s for the garden carry him out too early, or keep him there too late.</P>

<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VII. OF SUCCEDANEUMS FOR EXERCISE.</HEAD>
<P>THE benefit of exerci&s;e all know; but all can|not enjoy it; nor can it be had at all times. The very weather will &s;ome days deny the u&s;e of tho&s;e kinds we have named to &s;uch as are mo&s;t able to take them. In this ca&s;e, any bu&s;tling about within doors, whether in the way of bu&s;ine&s;s or amu&s;ement, will in &s;ome degree an&s;wer the purpo&s;e. The adju&s;ting an e&s;critoire, or the new arranging the volumes in a book-ca&s;e, have often produced this good effect; and billiards, or other entertainments which afford the means of &s;tirring within the hou&s;e, all an&s;wer the &s;ame purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="014116_0022_0F9300866EC5BD58">
To tho&s;e who are too weak for exerci&s;e, even the milde&s;t and in the be&s;t weather, the great relie is a fle&s;h-bru&s;h; and the effects of this, when u&s;ed with care and con&s;tancy, are more than can be imagined. We know what we expect from exerci&s;e; and in old men, the greate&s;t of its advantages is the a&s;&s;i&s;ting cir|culation. The fle&s;h-bru&s;h does this nearly in as great a degree, excepting only for the immediate time: But to have the full benefit, it mu&s;t be regu|larly and frequently repeated.</P>
<P>ANOTHER excellent &s;uccedaneum for exerci&s;e is wa&s;hing the body with warm water, and then rub|bing it very well with repeated dry cloths. This has many peculiar advantages; the warmth a&s;&s;i&s;ts per&s;piration; the wa&s;hing opens the pores; and the rubbing afterwards is nearly equal to the effect of the fle&s;h-bru&s;h. The warmth and moi&s;ture join al&s;o in &s;oftening the &s;kin, and rendering it &s;upple: And this is a great point; for all are apt to grow hard and dry with age.</P>
<P>GREAT care mu&s;t be taken to avoid taking cold after this. The be&s;t time for it is therefore evening, in a warm bed chamber; and the bed &s;hould be ready immediately, that the per&s;on may go into it while he is yet hot.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="014116_0023_0F930087D37F0720">
THE hands and feet &s;hould have their full &s;hare in this wa&s;hing and rubbing; for the circulation is weake&s;t there; and the pores mo&s;t liable to be &s;top|ped. The hot bath an&s;wers, in &s;ome degree this purpo&s;e, and will be &s;poken of hereafter: But that is rather to be u&s;ed as a remedy than a pre&s;ervative; and we are here treating of aged men in health.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. OF A REGULATION OF TEMPER, AND OF THE PASSIONS.</HEAD>
<P>WITHOUT entering into the province of the morali&s;t or preacher, we may affirm here, that the pa&s;&s;ions demand great regard in pre|&s;erving the health of old men. The motion of the blood in circulation is greatly affected and altered by them; and the nerves may &s;uffer yet more. The whole frame is di&s;ordered by violent pa&s;&s;ions: And I have often &s;een di&s;ea&s;es; and &s;ometimes immedi|ate death has been the con&s;equence of giving full &s;cope to them.</P>
<P>NOTHING in this world is worth the trouble and di&s;tre&s;s men bring upon them&s;elves by giving way to immoderate pa&s;&s;ions. Life is the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing, and health the next; and the&s;e both &s;uffer by that fond indulgence.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="014116_0024_0F930088705EB0C0">
THAT the circulation is di&s;ordered by the pa&s;|&s;ions, we know from the true and certain indication of the pul&s;e. In anger, it is violent and hard; in grief, faint and flow; terrors make it irregular; and &s;hame impedes its motions.</P>
<P>THESE are &s;ure notices of a di&s;ordered circulation; and old men cannot bear this, even for a time, with|out damage. The &s;trength of youth re&s;tores all to its former &s;tate, when the &s;udden gu&s;t is over; but age is weak, and cannot. Philo&s;ophy teaches the governing our pa&s;&s;ions; and that is true wi&s;dom. The old man &s;hould love him&s;elf too well to in|dulge them; it is not worth his while. Quiet and regularity of life in every re&s;pect are his bu&s;ine&s;s: and as he is pa&s;t the fluttering plea&s;ures of youth, let him place him&s;elf above its troubles.</P>
<P>GOOD humour, and a happy &s;atisfaction of mind, will give the aged many years, and much happine&s;s in them. Di&s;content and di&s;turbance wear out na|ture; but the quiet we advi&s;e, pre&s;erves her in good condition.</P>
<P>OF all pa&s;&s;ions, let the old man avoid a fooli&s;h fondne&s;s for women. This never will &s;olicit him; for nature knows her own time; and the appetite decays with the power: But if he will &s;olicit that
<PB N="26" REF="014116_0025_0F930089330FD6A0">which he cannot enjoy, he will di&s;turb his con&s;titu|tion more than by any other means whatever: And while he is &s;hortening his life, and robbing the poor remainder he allows, of peace, he will be only mak|ing him&s;elf the ridicule of tho&s;e who &s;eem to favour his vain and ineffectual de&s;ires.</P>
<P>IN pa&s;&s;ionate people, what we blame as their fault, is often their misfortune. Some indeed, from a ty|rannical di&s;po&s;ition, have fixed this humour upon them&s;elves by cu&s;tom; with no other cau&s;e; but for one of the&s;e, there are a hundred who&s;e fury of temper is owing to a di&s;order in their body.</P>
<P>We know madne&s;s is a di&s;ea&s;e; and violent pa&s;|&s;ion is a temporary madne&s;s. This al&s;o ari&s;es often from a redundance of humours; and medicines will cure it.</P>
<P>LET the pa&s;&s;ionate old man con&s;ider, that he hurts him&s;elf more than any body el&s;e, by his anger; and he will then wi&s;h to be cured of its tyranny. Let him examine him&s;elf, whether it be a di&s;order of his mind; and then his phy&s;ician, whether it lie in the body. In the fir&s;t ca&s;e the remedy is philo&s;ophy: But in the latter, a few medicines will re&s;tore him to temper; to that temper on which his life and happi|ne&s;s depend.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="014116_0026_0F930089EDFFBDD8">
LET the ha&s;ty old man cool him&s;elf by phy&s;ic and a low diet; and let him who is melancholy and gloomy, bani&s;h the everla&s;ting fear of death by warmer foods, cordial medicines, and that be&s;t of cordials, wine.</P>
<P>THESE will drive away much more than the ap|prehen&s;ion of death: They will put off the reality; for melancholy would have &s;unk the feeble, long before his time.</P>
<P>OF all &s;tates of the mind, a di&s;turbed hurry of the &s;pirits is mo&s;t to be avoided. The blood and the nerves are di&s;ordered by this much more than by la|bour, or bodily motion; and they are much longer in coming to them&s;elves again. Labour cea&s;es ab&s;o|lutely when 'tis over: But the &s;torms of the mind leave a &s;welling &s;ea, which &s;trength of body alone can calm; and in age this &s;trength is faint.</P>
<P>No di&s;ea&s;e is more mi&s;chievous to weak old per|&s;ons than a purging: And I have &s;een this brought on in&s;tantly by a fit of pa&s;&s;ion; or by a fright. Medicines have attempted to relieve the patient in vain. That flux which would have been &s;top'd, if natural, by a &s;poonful of chalk julep, or a do&s;e of dia&s;cordium, has in this ca&s;e reduced the per&s;on to a &s;keleton, and &s;unk him into the grave in &s;pite of all help.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="014116_0027_0F93008ABA045B20">
WHY &s;hould the old man di&s;turb his mind with anger? or what &s;hould he dread; Death is his great terror; and he is very ab&s;urd who brings that on by le&s;&s;er fears.</P>
<P>JOY, tho' it be only a greater &s;hare of &s;atisfaction, is, in a violent or outrageous degree, as hurtful as the other pa&s;&s;ions: It hurries the circulation vehe|mently and irregularly; it exhau&s;ts the &s;pirits; and when exce&s;&s;ive, it has often occa&s;ioned &s;udden death. It is a violence of youth; it belongs to that period of life more properly, that can bear it, and to that let us leave it. Let the old man be as the Quakers in this point, always chearful but never merry.</P>
<P>LAST, let us caution al&s;o the aged man who would be happy, and would live longer, to combat with all his power that dangerous enemy covetou&s;|ne&s;s. 'Tis known univer&s;ally, and we have &s;acred atte&s;tation of it, that too great carefulne&s;s brings age before its time; and in age it brings death premature|ly. The old are in no danger of extravagance; and the care of heaping up for others, when it &s;hortens their own life, is more than any heir de&s;erves.</P>
<P>EASE and good humour are the great ingredients of a happy life; and the principal means of a long one. Our whole le&s;&s;on extends but thus much far|ther;
<PB N="29" REF="014116_0028_0F93008B8CD6D1C8">that the old man love his life &s;o well; and va|lue &s;o little all the accidents which belong to it, that he do not give a vain attention to a part, which may rob him of the whole.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. OF SLEEP FOR OLD MEN.</HEAD>
<P>INTEMPERANCE has now converted day to night in the cour&s;e of the gay, young world; but this needs not, nor &s;hould influence tho&s;e in years. Midnight entertainment are no part of the oeconomy of their peaceful lives; and therefore they may come nearer to the cour&s;e of nature.</P>
<P>THE degree of &s;leep is a material article; and the time of it not le&s;s. The old man has been cautioned again&s;t the cold air of evenings; and we may now add, that after a light and early &s;upper, and an hour of &s;ocial conver&s;ation with his family and his neigh|bours, bed will be his be&s;t place.</P>
<P>SLEEP was intended to recruit nature, and to re|&s;tore the wa&s;ted &s;pirits. This is nece&s;&s;ary to all per|&s;ons; but to the aged mo&s;t; becau&s;e they can lea&s;t bear the wa&s;te of them. The pa&s;&s;ions will di&s;turb all con&s;titutions, but tho&s;e of old men mo&s;t of all.
<PB N="30" REF="014116_0029_0F93008C25C75748">Sleep compo&s;es the&s;e; therefore 'tis of excellent u&s;e to them; and they may &s;afely indulge in it longer than the young.</P>
<P>SIX hours is as long as a per&s;on in the prime of life &s;hould &s;leep; But in age, eight, or even ten, ac|cording to the peculiar con&s;titution, may be more proper.</P>
<P>THE natural &s;ea&s;on of &s;leep is night; and let the old man therefore go to bed in &s;uch time, that he may pa&s;s the&s;e hours of re&s;t without breaking in upon the morning. In general, the mo&s;t healthful cu&s;tom for age is, to go to bed at ten, and ri&s;e at eight in the morning.</P>
<P>IF the mind be hurry'd, or from any other cau&s;e the per&s;on finds he cannot compo&s;e him&s;elf to re&s;t &s;oon after going to bed; or get &s;o much &s;leep during the night; let him &s;till ri&s;e at the &s;ame time the fol|lowing day; and the next evening prepare him&s;elf thus for better &s;leep: Let him go into a warm bath; and indulge him&s;elf with a gla&s;s of wine, beyond his ordinary allowance, a little before bed time. This will take off his watchfulne&s;s, and he will &s;ink into the mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;lumber.</P>
<P>THE contrary practice, that of lying in bed in the morning, to make up for want of &s;leep at night, is
<PB N="31" REF="014116_0030_0F93008CEA6A1010">every way extremely wrong. As nothing refre&s;hes like &s;ea&s;onable &s;leep, nothing weakens and dejects a per&s;on more than indulging in bed in the day: There is al&s;o this farther ill con&s;equence from it, that the per&s;on is never &s;leepy, at the due time of the &s;uc|ceeding evening; and thus what was at fir&s;t an acci|cident, becomes by indulgence a cu&s;tom; and is then the more difficult to be conquered, and the more hurtful.</P>
<P>THE old man who has ob&s;erved a temperate diet, and has gone to bed regularly at ten o'clock, will na|turally wake towards eight. And when he wakes, let him get up. He will then be in &s;pirits for the day. If on the contrary he lies do&s;ing, he will get into a weakening &s;weat. He will then be low &s;pi|rited during the whole following day, and waking and watchful at night.</P>
<P>ON the&s;e little circum&s;tances do the health or &s;ick|ne&s;s, the happine&s;s or unea&s;ine&s;s of old per&s;ons de|pend in a very great mea&s;ure. We often do not perceive them, or we ea&s;ily overlook them: Let us be for the future more careful. There is no pain in living regularly in old age; and the con&s;equence of it is certain; a longer life, and every day of it more agreeable.</P>

<P>I HOPE it will be ea&s;y, by the preceding and the following directions, for any man of &s;en&s;e, not vers'd at all in phy&s;ic, to know the &s;tate of his own health preci&s;ely; and 'tis a mo&s;t important know|ledge. Hippocrates, who knew phy&s;ic better than all who have followed him, declares it to be an ea&s;y &s;cience, tho' it requires length of time to learn it; and Boerhaave, the Hippocrates of our &s;ucceeding times, lectur'd for ever publicly on the &s;implicity and ea&s;e of phy&s;ic. They perplex them&s;elves who think it difficult: Only let the plain con&s;iderate man attend to what he feels, and believe what is here told him will re&s;ult from it; then he may keep his mind at peace, which is a great ingredient in the health of the body; But this full credit is nece&s;&s;ary; for the origin of his di&s;orders is often very di&s;tant from their apparent effects.</P>
<P>HITHERTO we have treated of the condition of per&s;ons advanced in years who are healthy; and the rules we have laid down are for pre&s;erving and continuing that &s;tate: And he who ob&s;erves them duly cannot well fail of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>

WE now &s;hall con&s;ider the &s;everal more frequent faults of the con&s;titution at this period of life; and the di&s;ea&s;es ari&s;ing from them.</P>
<P>THE old man may be &s;o far his own doctor, as to amend the general di&s;temperature of his body; and often he may prevent tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es; But if he fall into them, whether by neglect of the&s;e cautions, or in &s;pite of their force, let him then call in a phy|&s;ician.</P>
<P>We can advi&s;e him how to pre&s;erve health when he has it; and how to remedy general di&s;orders, &s;o as to prevent more particular ones; &s;o far as a due regimen may do that: But he is a very ill judge of the human frame, who will pretend to remedy its di&s;ea&s;es without a knowledge both of its &s;tructure, and of the qualities of remedies; and he would be a bad member of &s;ociety, who gave &s;uch advice to any. It were as ea&s;y to teach &s;ome other art by writing, and as rational to attempt making a watch|maker, or a &s;hipbuilder by a de&s;cription of the tools.

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. OF A FULNESS OF BLOOD.</HEAD>
<P>AN overfulne&s;s of blood naturally brings on a redundance of the other humours; for as they are &s;eparated from the blood, they naturally encrea&s;e with it in quantity. The one or the other of the&s;e exce&s;&s;es may, and naturally will, occa&s;ion di&s;orders; much more both.</P>
<P>THE old man may know when he has too much blood in his veins from the&s;e plain &s;ymptoms; his pul&s;e will be full and &s;trong, and &s;omewhat quicker than it &s;hould; his complexion will be more florid; and his urine higher coloured. The veins al&s;o will be &s;welled, and his breathing will grow difficult.</P>
<P>THE occa&s;ion of all this has probably been too high feeding, and too little exerci&s;e; therefore the plain method to abate the &s;ymptoms and prevent the mi&s;chief which they threaten, is by more motion; and an ab&s;temious diet.</P>
<P>THIS is plainly the change which &s;hould be made; but it mu&s;t not be too &s;udden. We have ob&s;erved before, that all ha&s;ty alterations are dangerous: But as this is &s;lowly, let it be al&s;o determinately and re|gularly brought on. If therefore no di&s;ea&s;e be come
<PB N="35" REF="014116_0034_0F93008FEA8E9F70">on as yet from the fulne&s;s, there will not any come during a gradual cour&s;e of emptying the ve&s;&s;els by this practice. Nature will be relieved in a &s;atisfac|tory manner; whereas &s;he would have been too vio|lently di&s;turbed by any &s;udden &s;hock.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t rule is to retrench one third part from the fle&s;h eaten at dinner, of whatever kind that be. We have advi&s;ed the ab&s;taining from beef and pork, but in this ca&s;e mutton &s;hould be al&s;o let alone, or very rarely eaten; and the dinner being made &s;olely of the tender and young meats in this reduced quan|tity, the next care mu&s;t be, that the&s;e are always well and thoroughly dre&s;&s;ed. It is a fa&s;hion to eat meat almo&s;t raw, and doctors have advi&s;ed it; but they would be better phy&s;icians for bears and wolves than men.</P>
<P>LET the per&s;on ri&s;e an our before his u&s;ual time in the morning; and every day encrea&s;e the quanti|ty of exerci&s;e a little; but great care mu&s;t be taken not to go out at improper hours, to endanger getting cold. In getting rid of one evil, let us not run into another. This fulne&s;s is a &s;tate in which di&s;ea&s;es are mo&s;t ea&s;ily brought on, and they will be mo&s;t vio|lent in it. Colds are mo&s;t dangerous of all, to peo|ple in this condition, and therefore are very care|fully to be avoided.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="014116_0035_0F930090A7C6D898">
THE pul&s;e will &s;hew whether or not this method reduces the redundance of blood: If it do not take a vi&s;ible effect in four days, it will be proper to be blooded. After this the &s;ame regimen will probab|ly complete the bu&s;ine&s;s; and there will be no need for medicines.</P>
<P>BUT if all &s;hould fail, an addition of the warm bath every other day will probably an&s;wer the pur|po&s;e. In all old mens ca&s;es 'tis be&s;t to avoid medi|cines, if it can be done with &s;afety; for they di&s;|turb the con&s;titution, and the be&s;t guard of their health is quietne&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. OF WASTING AND DECAY.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN old per&s;ons fall into this declining condition, it generally carries them off; but many may be &s;aved by timely care; to whom no remedies will be of &s;ervice after a fir&s;t neglect. While the &s;tomach is able to dige&s;t any thing, there is hope of recovery; but when its power is lo&s;t, both food and phy&s;ic are poured down the throat in vain.</P>
<P>WHEN an aged per&s;on perceives his fle&s;h wa&s;ting, and his &s;trength and &s;pirits failing, let him take good
<PB N="37" REF="014116_0036_0F9300915C5B75E0">nouri&s;hment, and adapt it to the condition of his &s;tomach.</P>
<P>IF it be too &s;trong, or if he takes too much, the dige&s;tive faculty, already impaired by general weak|ne&s;s, cannot manage it; and he will ha&s;ten his death by &s;uch a conduct.</P>
<P>THE rule is to eat only innocent, tho' the mo&s;t nouri&s;hing things, and the&s;e only in moderate quan|tities; chicken, young lamb, and veal, boiled down almo&s;t to a jelly, are the proper foods for dinner; but even of the&s;e let him eat le&s;s than his appetite demands.</P>
<P>TWO hours before dinner, let him take half a pint of chicken broth; and as his &s;tomach afterwards grows &s;tronger, veal or mutton broth; and let him take the &s;ame again one hour after his light dinner.</P>
<P>LET his breakfa&s;t be a yolk of an egg, beaten up with half a pint of a&s;&s;es milk, and a quarter of an ounce of con&s;erve of ro&s;es; and his &s;upper veal broth nearly boiled to a jelly.</P>
<P>EVERY afternoon let him take half a pint of a&s;&s;es milk alone; and while all this is doing, let care be taken that there be no violent evacuations. A purg|ing would be de&s;tructive; and morning &s;weats are
<PB N="38" REF="014116_0037_0F930095B5DEA640">very hurtful. Let him therefore ri&s;e early; and to complete the cure let him believe the&s;e methods will perform it. An ea&s;y mind will do more than food and phy&s;ic.</P>
<P>QUIET, good humour, and complacency of tem|per, will prevent half the di&s;ea&s;es of old people: And they will cure one half of the others.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. AGAINST SHARP HUMOURS.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t &s;ign of &s;harp humours, in the bodies of old per&s;ons u&s;ually is an unea&s;ine&s;s at the &s;tomach; then comes on a want of appetite, with four belchings, wind, purgings, and defluctions; and la&s;t, thir&s;t, and a feveri&s;h di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>THE fault lies originally in the &s;tomach; and ge|nerally an irregular diet has been the cau&s;e; particu|larly high &s;auces, bad wines, and &s;picy foods. The fir&s;t &s;tep to a cure is to ab&s;tain from all the&s;e; and life depends upon it. For to aggravate tho&s;e &s;ymp|toms, is to de&s;troy the con&s;titution utterly. Incura|ble fevers, or fatal purgings follow.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t beginning is by a vomit; and after this the diet &s;hould be all of the mild and cooling kind.
<PB N="39" REF="014116_0038_0F9300979E2E2E58">Every morning let the per&s;on take two &s;poonfuls of &s;yrup of &s;nails, made by brui&s;ing them with &s;ugar, and hanging them up in a flannel bag till the juice runs out. At meals let his drink be a tea, made of mar&s;h-mallow and liquorice-root, with one third part milk, drank ju&s;t warm. If the &s;kin grow yellow, of the white of the eyes appear of that colour, a do&s;e of rhubarb once in three days will be needful. The be&s;t method of taking it is by chewing.</P>
<P>THIS is as much phy&s;ic as we would have an aged man u&s;e in &s;uch a ca&s;e; the re&s;t mu&s;t be done by a proper regimen.</P>
<P>FIRST let him regulate his pa&s;&s;ions. Violent an|ger will increa&s;e this di&s;order more than the mo&s;t improper foods. Let him al&s;o bani&s;h &s;ear: If he thinks him&s;elf in danger, he will bring it on.</P>
<P>HE mu&s;t never overload his &s;tomach; nor mu&s;t ever &s;uffer it to be empty. Once in two hours he &s;hould con&s;tantly &s;wallow &s;omething. Jellies of hart&s;horn, truly made, are excellent; but they mu&s;t be prepared at home: For cheating is &s;o ea&s;y, and the method with hart&s;horn only is &s;o tedious, that few who make them for &s;ale will do it hone&s;tly.</P>
<P>OFTEN this mi&s;chief ri&s;es from a &s;toppage of per|&s;piration in &s;ome part; particularly in the feet.
<PB N="40" REF="014116_0039_0F930098DE55A000">Then the bu&s;ine&s;s is to bring that evacuation on again by additional warmth, by flannel &s;ocks and yarn &s;tockings. This will in many ca&s;es alone perform the cure; and in all others, where &s;uch a &s;toppage of per&s;piration has been a part of the cau&s;e, it will a&s;&s;i&s;t the other methods.</P>
<P>THE pul&s;e, which was at fir&s;t too quick, will grow moderate as the&s;e methods of relief take place; and this promi&s;es a cure. To complete it the patient mu&s;t go to bed in time; and u&s;e moderate exerci&s;e in the be&s;t hours of the day. He mu&s;t eat no fat meats, drink little wine, and avoid care and unea&s;ine&s;s of mind.</P>
<P>IF he do not &s;leep well, he mu&s;t take a &s;mall do&s;e of &s;yrup of dia&s;cordium every night.</P>
<P>THIS method will probably re&s;tore him to health; and it mu&s;t be pre&s;erved with a due care afterwards; el&s;e relap&s;es in this ca&s;e are frequent. A vomit once in &s;ix weeks, and a do&s;e of rhubarb every ten days, with a careful diet, will u&s;ually make this a very healthy con&s;titution.</P>
<P>THE great care is taking the defect in time; for new di&s;orders are ea&s;ily conquered; but long e&s;ta|bli&s;hed ones are too ob&s;tinate for &s;uch weak bodies.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. OF PAINS AND INFLAMATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>IT is proper to treat of the&s;e together, becau&s;e they generally come one with the other. We need not tell the old man when he is in pain; But he mu&s;t examine carefully whether there be inflamation with it.</P>
<P>THIS he will know to be the ca&s;e by his pul&s;e beating hard and quick; and by high coloured urine: his fle&s;h al&s;o will be hotter than u&s;ual. When pains come on without the&s;e &s;ymptoms, warmth in the part, and patience, are the remedies: they mu&s;t be con&s;idered as the lot of age, and endu|red accordingly: but when other &s;ymptoms join with them, they threaten dangerous con&s;equences.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t &s;tep in this ca&s;e is bleeding: and this with ab&s;tinence from all hot foods often performs the cure.</P>
<P>IF this give no relief, the next day but one a vomit will be proper. If the body be co&s;tive, that in|flames all the &s;ymptoms; and if purges be given, they increa&s;e the violent motion of the blood, and therefore do more hurt than &s;ervice. Cooling and oily gly&s;ters are the proper method, and the only proper one; and they &s;hould be repeated regularly every morning.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="014116_0041_0F93009A681E5AF0">
THE diet mu&s;t be light and cool: all &s;olid foods &s;hould be omitted for the fir&s;t four or five days, and in their place a&s;&s;es milk &s;hould be taken. Chicken broth and jellies mu&s;t be the chief nouri&s;hment du|ring this period.</P>
<P>AFTER this, as the di&s;order abates, the &s;trength mu&s;t be con&s;idered; and by degrees the u&s;ual diet, &s;uch as is here recommended for healthy old men, &s;hould be introduced. But this mu&s;t be done gra|dually, and with great caution: otherwi&s;e, a &s;udden change, from low to richer diet, will certainly bring on the complaint again; with more and wor&s;e in|flamation.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="15" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XV. OF FLUXES.</HEAD>
<P>AGED people bear a too co&s;tive habit much better than they do fluxes or purgings: for they are ea&s;ily weakened; and nothing does it more than the&s;e di&s;charges.</P>
<P>THE great rule, in all the di&s;orders of aged per|&s;ons, is to take them in time. A purging will be cured by proper diet, when it is regarded early: otherwi&s;e medicines mu&s;t be called in; and perhaps they will be ineffectual.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="014116_0042_0F93009B1AC29600">
THE quantity of &s;olid food mu&s;t in this ca&s;e be reduced: but it &s;hould not be left off wholly. A drink &s;hould be made of burnt hart&s;horn and comfry root, two ounces of each boiled in two quarts of water to three pints, the liquor poured clear off, and drank warm with a little red wine. This &s;hould be the common drink.</P>
<P>RICE-MILK, with &s;ome cinnamon boiled in it, is excellent for breakfa&s;t; and rice-pudding be&s;t of all things for &s;upper; and this two hours before bed time. Sea-bui&s;cuit &s;hould on this occa&s;ion be eat in&s;tead of bread; and the patient mu&s;t u&s;e more than ordinary exerci&s;e, to promote per&s;piration.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="16" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. OF THE GRAVEL AND STONE.</HEAD>
<P>OLD per&s;ons are very &s;ubject to ob&s;tructions in the urinary pa&s;&s;ages; and often the various degrees of the gravel and &s;tone follow. The&s;e are di&s;orders difficult of cure: but they are ea&s;ily pre|vented in mo&s;t con&s;titutions.</P>
<P>LET tho&s;e who are &s;ubject but to &s;light complaints of this kind avoid wine; and &s;upply its place by clear malt liquor, of a due &s;trength.</P>
<P>LET the diet be cooling: and in regard to exerci&s;e, the great and golden rule is moderation. Violent
<PB N="44" REF="014116_0043_0F93009C6A666A78">motion, or re&s;t for a long time together, are equally wrong. Let the patient walk, or ride out every day at the proper hours; and when the weather does not permit that, let him u&s;e the &s;ame exerci&s;e in his chamber.</P>
<P>WHEN the fits come on, let him take manna and oil: This is an ea&s;y and effectual medicine. Two ounces of manna &s;hould be di&s;&s;olved in half a pint of water, and &s;ix &s;poonfuls of &s;alad oil added to it. A &s;poonful of this taken every half hour will &s;tay upon the &s;tomach, a&s;&s;wage the pain, &s;top the vomitings which u&s;ually attend the&s;e complaints; and at the &s;ame time procure &s;tools: and while it ea&s;es the cho|licky pains, it will give pa&s;&s;age to the &s;tone.</P>
<P>THIS is the cour&s;e in the violence of a fit. When it is perceived coming on, an infu&s;ion of Burdock root &s;lic'd, is the &s;afe&s;t, be&s;t, and mo&s;t effectual re|medy. Two ounces of the fre&s;h root, with a pint and half of boiling water poured on it, makes this infu&s;ion. The liquor is to be &s;trained off as &s;oon as cold; and half a pint, a little warmed again, with a quarter of a pint of milk, and &s;weetened with honey, is to be taken every four hours.</P>
<P>THIS is the medicine lately publi&s;hed al&s;o for the gout; and which many are now taking for that di&s;|ea&s;e with very great &s;ucce&s;s. The gout and gravel
<PB N="45" REF="014116_0044_0F93009CA45D8A30">are nearly ally'd, and it is not &s;trange the &s;ame reme|dy is &s;o effectual al&s;o in this ca&s;e. The wonder is, that a plant of &s;o great virtue, and &s;o common, has been &s;o long neglected by the practi&s;ers of phy&s;ic.</P>
<P>OF the gout it would be in vain to treat here. 'Tis a peculiar &s;ubject, and requires a larger compa&s;s than any &s;ingle article can be allowed in this work; and it has been con&s;idered &s;eparately in that treati&s;e.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="17" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. OF WEAKNESS.</HEAD>
<P>OLD men mu&s;t expect a decay of &s;trength: and it would be as idle &s;o call it a di&s;ea&s;e, as it were vain to think of remedies. But, be&s;ides this which is natural and nece&s;&s;ary, weakne&s;s is &s;ometimes accidental, and it may then be remedied.</P>
<P>GREAT evacuations, inten&s;e &s;tudy, violent pa&s;&s;i|ons, or a too low diet, will &s;ometimes bring it on be|fore the natural time; and then a proper care and regimen may in a great mea&s;ure remove it.</P>
<P>A WEAKNESS of the pul&s;e, feeblene&s;s of the limbs, a palene&s;s of the face, wa&s;te of fle&s;h, and low &s;pirits, are the &s;ymptoms by which this is known: the reme|dies are cordial medicines, and a &s;omewhat richer diet.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="014116_0045_0F93009D5E64E628">
THE medicine I have found mo&s;t effectual is this: a quarter of an ounce of &s;affron, a dram of cinnamon, and an ounce of confection of alkermes, put into a quart of white wine: when this has &s;tood two days it &s;hould be poured off, and half a wine-gla&s;s of it drank once a day.</P>
<P>REST of mind and body are al&s;o in this ca&s;e very e&s;&s;ential articles toward the cure. Let not the pati|ent think he is in danger: let him venture to eat &s;ome|what richer meats, but in a moderate quantity: and indulge in one extraordinary gla&s;s of wine at every meal.</P>
<P>LET him ri&s;e early; but not go out 'till the air is well warmed by the &s;un; and the dews are di&s;per&s;ed. If he re&s;ides in London at the time, let him immedi|ately go into the country: if he be too loo&s;e in his bowels let him check it moderately by the means we have before directed; and let his malt liquor be &s;trong of the hop.</P>
<P>BETWEEN breakfa&s;t and dinner let him every day take a yolk of a new laid egg, beat up in a gla&s;s of &s;trong white wine. The company of agreeable friends will be the be&s;t medicine in an evening; and good broth his fitte&s;t &s;upper.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII. OF AN ASTHMA.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is a common complaint with aged per|&s;ons; and there is none more trouble&s;ome. 'Tis difficult of cure; but &s;ome relief is ea&s;y: and that will depend as much on the place as on all other con&s;iderations together.</P>
<P>THE great care in this re&s;pect is that the air of his re&s;idence be neither thick nor damp.</P>
<P>THE &s;moke of London is very bad; and the ill &s;mells from many of the trades carried on there are likewi&s;e hurtful. No per&s;on &s;ubject to an a&s;thma &s;hould live near tanners in the country, nor tallow chandlers, or the like offen&s;ive trades, in London.</P>
<P>EXERCISE at proper times is highly beneficial in this ca&s;e. Walking or riding before dinner and &s;up|per are particularly u&s;eful.</P>
<P>FREQUENT wa&s;hing the feet in warm water, and good rubbing with dry cloths afterwards, is al&s;o highly &s;erviceable.</P>
<P>ALL cold and vi&s;cous foods mu&s;t be avoided. The &s;tomach mu&s;t not be &s;uffered to be empty, nor mu&s;t it be loaded. The food &s;hould be of the riche&s;t kind that can be proper for per&s;ons advanced in years; and to a&s;&s;i&s;t dige&s;tion, two or three di&s;hes of good green tea, made carefully and taken with little &s;ugar and without milk, &s;hould be drank con&s;tantly, two hours and a half after dinner</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="014116_0047_0F93009EE22E2AF8">
VEGETABLES mu&s;t be avoided; and one great caution &s;hould be, not to drink too much of any li|quor what&s;oever.</P>
<P>BLEEDING is u&s;ually nece&s;&s;ary; and the condition of the blood will &s;hew whether it &s;hould be in larger or &s;maller quantity; and whether or not it will re|quire to be &s;oon repeated.</P>
<P>IF the blood be &s;izey, &s;everal bleedings will pro|bably be wanted; and the &s;ame condition of it &s;hews that the body can &s;pare tho&s;e quantities. It &s;hews al&s;o, that without the&s;e bleeding medicines can take no effect.</P>
<P>AFTER all this, the greate&s;t pre&s;ervative again&s;t &s;harp or repeated fits is the famous gum ammoniacum. A quarter of an ounce of this being di&s;&s;olved in half a pint of water, two &s;poonfuls &s;hould be taken, ac|cording to the &s;ymptoms, every night, or every &s;e|cond or third night.</P>
<P>THIS method will prevent many fits, and abate the &s;everity of tho&s;e which cannot be avoided.</P>
<P>THUS the old man, even again&s;t the fury of this wor&s;t di&s;turbance of his life, as well as all the re&s;t, may live happy: and he ought to value that happi|ne&s;s the more, becau&s;e he will owe it to his own di&s;cretion.</P>
