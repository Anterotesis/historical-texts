<HEAD>A DEFENCE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. PRESIDENT,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Que&s;tion before us is, Have the Methodi&s;ts done mo&s;t Good or Evil? Now this &s;uppo&s;es, fir&s;t, That they have done both good and evil, otherwi&s;e it would be ab&s;urd to inquire which they have done mo&s;t of; and &s;econdly, it &s;uppo&s;es, That they have done both in nearly the &s;ame de|gree; otherwi&s;e it would not admit of any di&s;pute, much le&s;s of one &s;o large<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Speech was delivered on the third night.</NOTE> as this we are now engaged in. This then being the true &s;tate of the Que&s;tion, I undertake to demon&s;trate that it is both ab&s;urd and bla&s;phemous.</P>
<P>And, fir&s;t, It is ab&s;urd. For it &s;uppo&s;es that the &s;ame fountain &s;ends forth bitter water and &s;weet; that the &s;ame tree bears good and evil fruit; and they both do this in nearly the &s;ame degree. Be&s;ides, it to|tally de&s;troys that rule of judging given by our Lord, By their fruit ye &s;hall know them. For if the &s;ame tree bears good and evil fruit, how &s;hall we be able to judge by
<PB N="4" REF="028549_0003_0FD94056F6645100">
the fruit whether the tree be good or evil. In like manner, if the Methodi&s;ts bear the&s;e oppo&s;ite fruits, how can the world judge whether they are fal&s;e prophets or true? whether &s;ent of God or of the Devil?</P>
<P>Again. Our Lord &s;ays, A good man, out of the good trea&s;ure of his heart, bring|eth forth good things, and (not the &s;ame, but) an evil man, out of the evil trea&s;ure of his heart, bringeth forth evil things. Now the que&s;tion, in its pre&s;ent form, turns this into the greate&s;t ab&s;urdity. For it &s;uppo&s;es that one of the&s;e may have both the&s;e trea|&s;ures in his heart, bringing forth good and evil things! That is, it &s;uppo&s;es that he may be a good and an evil man at the &s;ame time, and have a good and an evil trea&s;ure in his heart, bringing forth the&s;e oppo&s;ite things! which is a mo&s;t palpable ab&s;urdity.</P>
<P>Secondly, It is bla&s;phemous. In proof of this let it be ob&s;erved, that, according to the Scriptures, good and evil are brought into being by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;piritual agen|cies: good, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of God, and evil, by that of the devil. Hence, &s;peaking of good, they &s;ay, All the good that is done upon earth, the Lord doeth it, and that it is God who worketh in us both to will and do of his good plea&s;ure. On the other hand, all moral evil is attributed to the agency of Satan. Therefore he is &s;aid
<PB N="5" REF="028549_0004_0FD9405C1806AE38">
to work, with energy, in the children of di&s;obedience; and in particular, to have beguiled Eve, and to have put it into the heart of Ananias and Sapphira to lie unto the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P>Now as the que&s;tion before us &s;uppo&s;es that good and evil are both done by the Methodi&s;ts, it mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that there is communion between light and darkne&s;s, and concord between Chri&s;t and Belial: the one working in, and by the Methodi&s;ts all the good they do, and the other all the evil: and which works harde&s;t, Chri&s;t in helping them to do good, or Belial in help|ing them to do evil, is the bla&s;phemous point we are this night to determine!</P>
<P>Perhaps it is owing to this great impro|priety of the que&s;tion, that no one has yet &s;o much as attempted to &s;peak directly to it: that is, that no one has once offered to &s;hew, What good and evil the Methodi&s;ts have done; and then which is the greate&s;t. In&s;tead of this, the Oppo&s;ers of Methodi&s;m have aim|ed at nothing but Ridicule and Abu&s;e: therefore their Advocates have hitherto thought it quite enough to an&s;wer tho&s;e fal&s;e and ridiculous accu&s;ations.</P>
<P>Nor indeed is it po&s;&s;ible to &s;peak directly to the que&s;tion, in its pre&s;ent form, with any degree of propriety: therefore I &s;hall
<PB N="6" REF="028549_0005_0FD9405D0F33A9A0">
take the liberty to amend it, and only a&s;k, Have the Methodi&s;ts done Good or Evil?</P>
<P>In &s;peaking to the que&s;tion thus amended, I &s;hall &s;hew, fir&s;t, who the Methodi&s;ts are. Then, &s;econdly, inquire, Whether they have done good or evil?</P>
<P>And, Fir&s;t, I am to &s;hew, who the Me|thodi&s;ts are. And, fir&s;t, it is certain that tho&s;e who were dead a hundred years before any Methodi&s;t was born, cannot be taken into the account. Therefore to impute to them the ab&s;urdities of John of Mun&s;ter, or of Nailor of Bri&s;tol, or of any other who lived a hundred, or a hundred and fifty years ago, is an in&s;ult both on Methodi&s;m and common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Secondly, There are &s;everal denomina|tions of Chri&s;tians now living, who are fre|quently called Methodi&s;ts, who do not be|long to them. For in&s;tance; the Moravians, the Independents, the Bapti&s;ts, the Antino|mians; together with many mini&s;ters and congregations, who, in every &s;en&s;e of the word, belong to the church of England. Now though many of the&s;e preach the &s;ame doctrines, and entertain a favourable opi|nion of the Methodi&s;ts; and though, on the other hand, the Methodi&s;ts very highly e&s;teem many of the&s;e; yet they cannot, with any propriety, be called Methodi&s;ts. For, fir&s;t, their names were never entered in any
<PB N="7" REF="028549_0006_0FD9405EA9527DC0">
Regi&s;ter of the Methodi&s;t &s;ocieties. Se|condly, they were never &s;ubject to tho&s;e rules and regulations by which the Method|i&s;ts are governed. Thirdly, they do not &s;o much as bear the Methodi&s;t-name, unle&s;s it be impo&s;ed on them, and then they ge|nerally di&s;own, and di&s;claim it. Nor, fourth|ly, were they ever acknowledged by the Methodi&s;ts, as any part of their community. As to &s;ome of the&s;e, the Antinomians, they are profe&s;&s;edly, as great enemies to the laws of Methodi&s;m, as they are to the laws of God! To impute, therefore, the follies of the&s;e, or of any other of the above deno|minations, to the Methodi&s;ts, is ab&s;urd and cruel.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Neither can the que&s;tion intend any mere individual, as &s;uch; &s;eeing it &s;peaks, in the plural, of "the Methodi&s;ts." Now there are &s;everal &s;orts of individuals, called Methodi&s;ts, who mu&s;t be excluded from the bu&s;ine&s;s in hand. As fir&s;t, &s;uch as are, or have been called Methodi&s;ts, who never were in any connection with them. Of this &s;ort I knew an in&s;tance when I was a boy. A man in a gown and ca&s;&s;oc preach|ing in the town where I was, pa&s;&s;ed for a Methodi&s;t: but when the mob began to be unruly he cried out, "I am no Methodi&s;t." Now had this man been guilty of any irre|gularity (which I know not that he was)
<PB N="8" REF="028549_0007_0FD9406371821280">
doubtle&s;s it would have been &s;et down to the Methodi&s;t's account. Another &s;ort of individuals, almo&s;t always called Method|i&s;ts, are tho&s;e who have been expelled for their evil practices. Per&s;ons of this &s;ort have too frequently been found in all deno|minations of Chri&s;tians: even that &s;mall number which followed our Lord while he was on earth, for &s;ome time had a Judas among them. Now, whatever other com|munities do, when the Methodi&s;ts di&s;cover an unholy walker among them, they fir&s;t endeavour to reclaim him; but if they can|not do this, they then put him away from their &s;ocieties. And though this is all they can do, or ought to do, for the honor of God, and for their own credit, yet the evil practices of &s;uch per&s;ons continue to be im|puted to the Methodi&s;ts; yea, though they have been out of that connection for a great number of years.</P>
<P>A third &s;ort of individuals unju&s;tly called Methodi&s;ts, are tho&s;e who are Apo&s;tates from Methodi&s;m; tho&s;e who have made &s;hipwreck of faith and of a good con&s;cience. Now apo&s;tates are well known to be often &s;ome of the bittere&s;t enemies the people have from whom they have apo&s;tatized. Witne&s;s Satan, the original apo&s;tate; who ever &s;ince his apo&s;ta&s;y has been doing all in his power, again&s;t God and man: witne&s;s
<PB N="9" REF="028549_0008_0FD94064F0A9C768">
Alexander the copper &s;mith, in the apo&s;tle's days, whom St. Paul &s;aid had done him much wrong: witne&s;s Julian the Apo&s;tate, who, after his apo&s;ta&s;y, became one of the greate&s;t per&s;ecutors the Chri&s;tians ever had. Add to the&s;e, the two principal Oppo&s;ers of Methodi&s;m on this occa&s;ion. The&s;e gentle|men, in the pre&s;ence of this a&s;&s;embly, have avowed their apo&s;ta&s;y from Methodi&s;m, in the mo&s;t explicit terms, and then have pour|ed out &s;uch torrents of low and &s;candalous abu&s;e, on tho&s;e who were once their bre|thren, as is &s;hocking to every Chri&s;tian ear. Among many other in&s;tances one of them has &s;aid, "The Methodi&s;ts have thronged Bedlam with lunatics: made Tyburn groan with criminals; and quite crowded the bot|tomle&s;s pit!" Now I a&s;k every man of &s;en&s;e, if the&s;e, and the like, are not fine gentry to be fathered on the Methodi&s;ts? Or rather if it is not great inju&s;tice to make them re&s;pon&s;ible for the conduct of &s;uch virulent Apo&s;tates!</P>
<P>But if the&s;e are not, who then are the Methodi&s;ts? I an&s;wer, Tho&s;e who are mem|bers of the &s;everal &s;ocieties in&s;tituted by the original founders of Methodi&s;m. Now the&s;e are the Rev. John We&s;ley, and the late Rev. George Whitefield. All therefore who are members of the &s;ocieties, in&s;tituted and e&s;tabli&s;hed by the&s;e, and who are go|verned
<PB N="10" REF="028549_0009_0FD940664BF4F578">
by the rules and regulations they have laid down, are properly, "The Me|thodi&s;ts."</P>
<P>Having &s;hewn who the Methodi&s;ts are, I proceed, Secondly, to inquire, whether they have done Good or Evil?</P>
<P>But before I do this, it is nece&s;&s;ary to make a few ob&s;ervations on the different ways of doing good and evil. Now the&s;e may be done two ways: directly, and indi|rectly; or rather properly and accidentally. Good and evil are done directly, or pro|perly, when the cau&s;e naturally produces the effect. They are done improperly, or accidentally, when an effect follows which does not naturally or properly belong to the cau&s;e. For in&s;tance; you &s;ee a per&s;on in danger of dying for want of bread. From a principle of humanity you <HI>de&s;ign</HI> to &s;ave him. In order to this end, you give him a piece of bread, which is an immediate and natural <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of producing the effect you intended. But this cau&s;e cannot produce this effect, unle&s;s the per&s;on receives, and u&s;es the bread in a proper manner. But he does &s;o receive and u&s;e it, and of con&s;e|quence his life is &s;aved. Here then is good done immediately and directly, as the effect has naturally followed the cau&s;e. But good may be done accidentally. One man &s;eeing another, whom he &s;uppo&s;es to be his ene|my,
<PB N="11" REF="028549_0010_0FD9406909230128">
<HI>intends</HI> to kill him. In order to this end, he thru&s;ts a &s;word through his body. But the &s;word mi&s;&s;ing the vitals, opens an impo&s;thume, whereby his enemy's life is &s;aved. Now here was an evil <HI>intended,</HI> and evil <HI>means</HI> made u&s;e of to bring it to pa&s;s; but notwith&s;tanding both, good accident|ally followed.</P>
<P>In like manner evil may be done directly and accidentally. And fir&s;t, directly. A man on &s;eeing his enemy, <HI>intends</HI> to kill him. For this purpo&s;e he runs a &s;word through his heart; the con&s;equence is, his enemy drops down dead at his feet: as mu&s;t be the ca&s;e, &s;eeing the cau&s;e naturally pro|duced the effect. This evil then was not accidental, but natural, immediate, and direct. On the other hand, evil may be done accidentally. For in&s;tance. You &s;ee a boy in danger of dying for want. You <HI>de&s;ign</HI> to &s;ave him. For <HI>that end</HI> you give him a piece of bread. But by a carele&s;s u&s;e of it, a crumb &s;ticks in his throat and &s;uffocates him, and in a &s;hort time he ex|pires. Now if you had not intended to have &s;aved him, you would not have given him the bread; and if you had not done this, it would not have occa&s;ioned his death. It is therefore certain that what you did was the cau&s;e of his death: &s;eeing he would not have died by means of that
<PB N="12" REF="028549_0011_0FD9406A768A18E0">
bread, if you had not given it him. But as this evil did not happen as a natural con|&s;equence of your genero&s;ity; but rather through the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, or wantonne&s;s of him you gave it to, the evil was entirely accidental with re&s;pect to you.</P>
<P>Now as to this la&s;t &s;ort of evil, there is nothing excellent or prai&s;e-worthy, which is not liable to it. For in&s;tance; when God created angels and men, his <HI>de&s;ign</HI> was only good, viz. that they might glorify him, and be happy to all eternity. And the <HI>means</HI> which he made u&s;e of in creating them, or rather the manner in which he created them, was perfectly con&s;onant with his de&s;ign. For he created them in his own image; endued with rea&s;on and under&s;tand|ing; with liberty to choo&s;e the good and refu&s;e the evil; that they might be capable of a greater reward, by performing a free and voluntary obedience. But notwith|&s;tanding the Creator only <HI>intended</HI> good, and created them in a <HI>manner</HI> which was mo&s;t likely to promote that end, yet much evil en&s;ued, viz. all the &s;in and mi&s;ery which began pre&s;ently after their creation, and which will la&s;t to all eternity. Now if men and angels had not been created, this vvil could not have happened; but as it was no part of their Creator's <HI>de&s;ign,</HI> nor natu|rally followed from the <HI>manner</HI> of their cre|ation;
<PB N="13" REF="028549_0012_0FD9406F37FE1758">
but aro&s;e merely from the abu&s;e of their liberty, which God intended only for their good, the evil was certainly acci|dental.</P>
<P>Again, when God entered into covenant with Abraham he <HI>intended</HI> great good both to him and his family; and al&s;o that in him all the families of the earth &s;hould be ble&s;&s;|ed. And there is no doubt but the terms of that covenant corre&s;ponded with his de|&s;ign, otherwi&s;e a God of infinite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s would not have given them. But notwith&s;tanding this, the perver&s;ene&s;s of men occa&s;ioned much accidental evil to proceed therefrom: &s;uch as the tyranny of the Egyptians, and the oppre&s;&s;ion of the Hebrews. This tyranny al&s;o occa&s;ioned all the plagues which &s;ell on that hardened people, in their own land, and at la&s;t their overthrow in the Red Sea. And all the evils which befel the I&s;raelites and their enemies, both in the wilderne&s;s, and in the land of Canaan, happened in the &s;ame way; &s;o that the&s;e may properly be called acci|dental evils.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tianity likewi&s;e is &s;ubject to this &s;ort of evil. Undoubtedly the <HI>de&s;ign</HI> of God in this was, the greate&s;t good that a &s;inful world was capable of; being nothing le&s;s than their pre&s;ent and eternal &s;alvation. And <HI>what he did,</HI> in order to this end, was
<PB N="14" REF="028549_0013_0FD94071F317AE70">
the mo&s;t perfect di&s;play of divine wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s ever made known to angels or men. Yet we all know that great evils were occa&s;ioned thereby, which otherwi&s;e could never have happened: &s;uch as the oppo&s;iti|ons of the Jews and Gentiles on the one hand, and all the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t and his followers on the other.</P>
<P>If we de&s;cend to particulars, we &s;hall find that every part of Chri&s;tianity is liable to accidental evil. For in&s;tance, the birth of Chri&s;t was the accidental cau&s;e of the &s;laughter of the infants, by the order of Herod: the fa&s;ting of Chri&s;t in the wilder|ne&s;s was the accidental cau&s;e of Satan's hor|rid and bla&s;phemous temptations; the mi|racles of Chri&s;t accidentally occa&s;ioned the bla&s;phemies of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees: the preaching of Chri&s;t thus occa&s;ioned the oppo&s;ition he met with on that account: the crucifixion of Chri&s;t thus occa&s;ioned the in&s;ults he received in the judgment-hall and on Calvary: and the re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t was the accidental cau&s;e of the rulers &s;ub|borning the &s;oldiers to &s;ay, His di&s;ciples came and &s;tole him away while we were a&s;leep. Add to this, that the exi&s;tence of the word of God is the accidental cau&s;e of men wre&s;ting it to their own de&s;truction: the preaching of the Apo&s;tles was thus the cau&s;e of its becoming the &s;avour of death
<PB N="15" REF="028549_0014_0FD94073F83E48F0">
unto many. Again, Wherever the grace of God is turned into wantonne&s;s, we mu&s;t &s;ay, that it is remotely or accidentally the cau&s;e of that abu&s;e; for if that grace had never exi&s;ted, it could not po&s;&s;ibly have been thus abu&s;ed.</P>
<P>Once more, The Reformation has been productive of much accidental evil. Un|doubtedly the <HI>de&s;ign</HI> of our fir&s;t Reformers was only the good of the church of Chri&s;t. And the <HI>means</HI> they made u&s;e of, in expo&s;|ing the &s;uper&s;titions and idolatries of the church of Rome, were the mo&s;t likely to accompli&s;h their de&s;ign. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e, much evil followed, viz. all the per|&s;ecutions the Papi&s;ts were guilty of, and all the martyrdoms, and other &s;ufferings, the Prote&s;tants endured. But as all the&s;e per|&s;ecutions and &s;ufferings were contrary both to the de&s;ign of the Reformers, and to the natural tendency of what they did; they were accidental evils, and therefore not to be imputed to the Reformers, as faults of theirs.</P>
<P>In like manner, Methodi&s;m has been at|tended with much accidental evil. Undoubt|edly the original founders of Methodi&s;m had a <HI>good de&s;ign.</HI> Had they aimed at ea&s;e, they would not have voluntarily undertaken the harde&s;t labours; much le&s;s have continued therein. Had they wi&s;hed for the prai&s;e
<PB N="16" REF="028549_0015_0FD940784235A4B0">
that cometh of men, they would not, know|ingly and wilfully, have expo&s;ed them&s;elves to almo&s;t univer&s;al reproach. And had they aimed at riches, they would have gone to the rich and great, and not to the mo&s;t poor and indigent. Their <HI>de&s;ign,</HI> therefore, mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to be, The glory of God, and the good of men. And the <HI>means</HI> they made u&s;e of were the mo&s;t likely to accom|pli&s;h their de&s;ign. For not being &s;atisfied with what they felt in them&s;elves, and &s;aw in tho&s;e about them, who were reputed good Chri&s;tians, they determined, with much prayer and fa&s;ting, to &s;earch the Original Scriptures, to &s;ee what real Chri&s;tianity was: whether there was any thing more contained therein, than doing no harm, and doing good, and u&s;ing the ordinances of God. They had not gone on long this way, before they di&s;covered, that Chri&s;ti|anity required a right &s;tate of mind, con|&s;i&s;ting of right tempers and de&s;ires, and that from hence right words and actions were to proceed. No &s;ooner were they thoroughly convinced of this, than they began to be in earne&s;t in &s;eeking it for them&s;elves: then in recommending it to tho&s;e who came in their way, who had any inclination to hear them. They then went to the pri&s;ons, and recommended it to the mo&s;t wretched criminals. At la&s;t they
<PB N="17" REF="028549_0016_0FD9407A343B9118">
boldly preached the religion of the heart to the whole Univer&s;ity. From Oxford they came to London, and in&s;i&s;ted on the &s;ame doctrine there in many of the churches. After a &s;hort &s;tay in London, they went to America, to convert the Indians to this reli|gion. After attempting this they returned to London, where their congregations were much greater than they had been before. After awhile, the principal inhabitants of the &s;everal pari&s;hes where the&s;e gentlemen preached, complained that they were greatly incommoded by the immen&s;e multitudes which came to hear. The con&s;equence was, that fir&s;t one church, then another, and at la&s;t, all the churches were &s;hut again&s;t them. On this they went into Moorfields, and di|vers other places, preaching the kingdom of God to thou&s;ands, and tens of thou|&s;ands, of all &s;orts of people; but chiefly to &s;uch as would not hear it in any other place. After doing this for awhile in and about London, they went to Bri&s;tol, and did the &s;ame there. From hence they went, with their lives in their hands, to the mo&s;t igno|rant and &s;avage parts of the nation, and preached Chri&s;t and his kingdom to the colliers in King&s;wood, Newca&s;tle, and Staf|ford&s;hire: then to the tinners in Cornwall: and at la&s;t, to almo&s;t every city, town and village in the three kingdoms. And thus
<PB N="18" REF="028549_0017_0FD9407D3403EB00">
one of them, the great and good Mr. Whitefield, went on to his dying day; and thus the truly venerable Mr. We&s;ley goes on, with unabating ardour, to this day, although he is now between eighty and ninety years of age.</P>
<P>And what has been &s;aid of the&s;e great and good men, to who&s;e labours the&s;e king|doms owe &s;o much, may in a good mea&s;ure be &s;aid of tho&s;e, who from time to time, have laboured with them. For the event has abundantly &s;hewn, that the&s;e in general, &s;et out with a &s;ingle eye; and that the fame good intention has influenced them in fol|lowing the &s;teps of their leaders.</P>
<P>Now, whoever con&s;iders the &s;criptural accounts of former ages, the hi&s;tories of later dates, and the &s;tate mankind is in at pre&s;ent; will &s;oon be convinced, that a great variety of accidental evils mu&s;t follow &s;uch a work. Men of influence, who have no religion, will cry out again&s;t tho&s;e who endeavour to be better than them&s;elves: men of mere out&s;ide religion, like the Pha|ri&s;ees of old, will exclaim again&s;t tho&s;e who are &s;eeking the kingdom of God within them: hypocrites and deceivers are &s;ure to have &s;omething to &s;ay again&s;t tho&s;e who profe&s;s to be true of heart: and all the&s;e will &s;tir up the rabble to be guilty of various and great outrages. So it was in
<PB N="19" REF="028549_0018_0FD9408128B60328">
the days of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles; &s;o it was in the following ages of the church; and &s;o it has been among the Methodi&s;ts. Men of learning, fortune, power, and in|fluence, invented or propagated evil reports; hence aro&s;e a great variety of barefaced ca|lumnies and &s;landers. By the&s;e the rabble were encouraged to in&s;ult the per&s;ons, and de&s;troy the property of the Methodi&s;ts. By the&s;e means, not only one neighbour was often &s;et again&s;t another, but there were frequent di&s;turbances in families. As our Lord &s;aid, there were five in a hou&s;e, three again&s;t two, and two again&s;t three: the father again&s;t his &s;on, and the &s;on again&s;t his father; the mother again&s;t her daughter, and the daughter again&s;t her mother; the mother-in-law again&s;t her daughter-in-law, and the daughter-in-law again&s;t her mother-in-law; &s;o that a man's foes were often tho&s;e of his own hou&s;ehold. Now had the&s;e evils been a thou&s;and times greater than they were, as they were not the natural and direct con&s;equence of Methodi&s;m, but ra|ther accidental con&s;equences, which fol|lowed from the abu&s;e thereof, the Method|i&s;ts are no more to be blamed on account thereof, than the Reformers are for the abu&s;e of the Reformation; or Chri&s;t, for the abu&s;e of Chri&s;tianity; or God, for the evils which were occa&s;ioned by his entering
<PB N="20" REF="028549_0019_0FD940863655DDC8">
into covenant with Abraham, or for the abu&s;e which men and angels made of the creation of the world.</P>
<P>We will therefore put accidental evil en|tirely out of the que&s;tion; and a&s;k, Se|condly, Have the Methodi&s;ts done evil im|mediately and directly? If they have, it has been either by their doctrine or their di&s;cipline. But have they done it by their doctrine? That this may be fairly and fully under&s;tood, let us &s;ee what their doctrine is. And, fir&s;t, They teach that all men are &s;inners by nature and practice. Second|ly, That Chri&s;t died to &s;ave &s;inners. Third|ly, That men mu&s;t unfeignedly repent of all their &s;ins. Fourthly, That they mu&s;t believe the Go&s;pel. Fifthly, That all who thus repent and believe, are ju&s;tified; that is, pardoned and accepted of God. Sixth|ly, That all who are thus pardoned, ought to love God with all their hearts, mind, &s;oul, and &s;trength. Seventhly, That he that loves God, ought to love his brother al&s;o: yea, that he ought to love his neigh|bour (every man, friend and enemy) as him&s;elf. Eighthly, That all who thus be|lieve and love, ought to be careful to main|tain good works. Ninthly, That every Chri&s;tian ought to endeavour to be holy in all manner of conver&s;ation, as he who hath called him is holy. Tenthly, That while
<PB N="21" REF="028549_0020_0FD940887B6667D8">
they are in this world, they ought to grow in Grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Eleventhly, That he that endures unto the end the &s;ame &s;hall be &s;aved. Twelfthly, That they who have thus done good, &s;hall go to the Re&s;ur|rection of Life; but they that have done evil, to the Re&s;urrection of Damnation.</P>
<P>Now I appeal to every one who is ac|quainted with the doctrine of the Method|i&s;ts, if this is not the &s;um thereof: if the particulars above mentioned, are not the points chiefly in&s;i&s;ted on both among Mr. We&s;ley's and Mr. Whitefield's followers. If &s;o, I &s;hall be glad to know if there is any tendency in the&s;e doctrines, whether taken &s;eparately, or in conjunction with each other, to do evil. Has that which teaches the fall and actual wickedne&s;s of man? Does it not rather tend to humble him? Has the doctrine of the atonement? What! the doctrine which points out the love of God in giving his Son to &s;ave us from our &s;ins? Has the doctrine of re|pentance, which teaches us to be &s;orry for our &s;ins, and that we &s;hould immediately for&s;ake them, &s;uch a tendency? Is there any tendency to evil in the doctrine of faith: which in&s;i&s;ts on our coming to Chri&s;t for the &s;alvation he has purcha&s;ed for us? Has the doctrine of ju&s;tification, of pardon
<PB N="22" REF="028549_0021_0FD9408EB0514EF8">
and adoption for every penitent believer, any tendency to do evil? Or the&s;e which teach that we ought to love God with all our heart, and our neighbour as our&s;elves? Or tho&s;e which inculcate the nece&s;&s;ity of good works, of growing in grace, of uni|ver&s;al holine&s;s, of per&s;everance in the ways of God, or of eternal rewards and puni&s;h|ments? I &s;ay, is there any thing that bears the &s;malle&s;t re&s;emblance of a tendency to do evil in any of the&s;e?</P>
<P>But has not their di&s;cipline done evil? Let us examine this point with candor and impartiality. The &s;ub&s;tance of their di&s;ci|pline is as follows: Fir&s;t, No per&s;on is ad|mitted into their &s;ocieties who is known to live in open &s;in. Secondly, When admit|ted, he is required to hear, read, and me|ditate on the word of God as frequently as he can. Thirdly, Each member is expected to pray, in public, in his family, and in private. Fourthly, He mu&s;t a&s;&s;emble with his brethren, for mutual edification, at every &s;tated opportunity, if health and bu|&s;ine&s;s will admit. Fifthly, He is expected to receive the &s;upper of the Lord at every proper opportunity: Sixthly, It is al&s;o ex|pected of him to u&s;e fa&s;ting or ab&s;tinence, as often as health, bu&s;ine&s;s and opportunity &s;erve. Seventhly, It is moreover required of him to be merciful after his power to
<PB N="23" REF="028549_0022_0FD940906D7BEBC0">
the bodies and &s;ouls of men. Eighthly, In order to this end, It is expected that he be not &s;lothful in bu&s;ine&s;s; but rather work with his hands, the things that are right, that he may owe no man any thing; that he may provide, for him&s;elf and family, things lawful in the &s;ight of all men; and have to give to him that needeth. Ninthly, It is required of him to &s;hew a good exam|ple to all men, that the Go&s;pel be not blamed. Now this is the &s;ub&s;tance of the Methodi&s;t di&s;cipline, which certainly (to &s;ay no more at pre&s;ent) can have no ten|dency to do evil.</P>
<P>But if they have not done evil, what have they done? I an&s;wer, They have done much good. But what good have they done? Spiritual and temporal good. And, fir&s;t, they have done &s;piritual good. For fir&s;t they have been in&s;truments in turning the mo&s;t ignorant, vulgar, and ridiculous &s;inners from darkne&s;s to light. Multitudes who, before they heard the Methodi&s;ts, knew neither them&s;elves nor God, are now well acquainted with both. As to them|&s;elves, they know that they were &s;hapen in iniquity, and that in &s;in did their mother conceive them. They know that on that account their heart is deceitful above all things and de&s;perately wicked. In other words, they know that they have in them
<PB N="24" REF="028549_0023_0FD940923A870458">
a carnal mind which is enmity again&s;t God, which is not &s;ubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be&mdash;till it is renewed. They know al&s;o that this evil nature is the &s;ource from whence all outward wickedne&s;s proceeds; that it is this fountain which &s;ends forth all the corrupt &s;treams of out|ward &s;in. Again, they know as all men are &s;inners by nature and practice, that they are condemned already, that the wrath of God <HI>now</HI> abideth on them. Again, they know that this &s;tate of &s;in and condemna|tion is an infallible &s;ource of pre&s;ent mi&s;ery: that it is on this account the wicked are like the troubled &s;ea which cannot re&s;t, who&s;e waves ca&s;t up mire and dirt; that de&s;truc|tion&mdash;eternal de&s;truction, and mi&s;ery&mdash;pre|&s;ent mi&s;ery are in their path, and that the way of peace they have not known. Once more, They know that they cannot &s;ave them&s;elves, that they cannot bring a clean thing out of an unclean, that they cannot make them&s;elves new creatures, and that if it is not done in time, they cannot be holy or happy here, much le&s;s &s;aved to all eter|nity.</P>
<P>And as for God, They know that he is, and that he is a Rewarder of tho&s;e that diligently &s;eek him. They know that in Him they live, and move, and have their being. They know that God was in Chri&s;t
<PB N="25" REF="028549_0024_0FD94095F5A1E390">
reconciling the world unto him&s;elf, not im|puting their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es unto them. They know that God commandeth all men every where to repent, and al&s;o to believe the Go&s;pel. They know that all who do this are ju&s;tified and born of God. They know that all &s;uch have the kingdom of God within them, even righteou&s;ne&s;s, and peace, and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t. They know that from this inward principle, all good works, yea, all holine&s;s and happine&s;s pro|ceed. And they know that this inward and outward religion is the gift of God: that it comes <HI>from</HI> the Father, <HI>through</HI> the Son, <HI>by</HI> the Holy Gho&s;t; and that therefore all the prai&s;e belongs to Him in Time and Eternity.</P>
<P>If any one doubt, of their having this knowledge, he may &s;oon &s;atisfy him&s;elf: only let him go into any city, town or vil|lage, where Methodi&s;m has prevailed, and enquire fir&s;t, what &s;ort of people the Me|thodi&s;ts formerly were, with re&s;pect to knowledge; and then let him conver&s;e with them a &s;ingle hour on any of the above particulars, and he will doubt no longer.</P>
<P>Again, As the Methodi&s;ts have turned many from darkne&s;s to light, &s;o al&s;o, have they from the power of Satan unto God. Surely, if ever any were taken captive by the devil at his will, many of the&s;e were in
<PB N="26" REF="028549_0025_0FD9409771F713A0">
a very high degree. It is dreadful to con|ceive what &s;laves to &s;in, and what enemies to all that is good, multitudes of them were: what pride, pa&s;&s;ion, and evil de&s;ires: and what lu&s;t, cruelty, and inju&s;tice, filled, and governed their hearts. And from this corrupt fountain i&s;&s;ued forth abundance of polluted &s;treams: on this evil tree grew a large quantity of evil fruit, &s;uch as drunk|enne&s;s, whoredom, cur&s;ing, &s;wearing, ly|ing, fighting, thieving, &s;abbath-breaking, gaming, extortion, oppre&s;&s;ion and the like. But by hearing the Methodi&s;ts, the Lions became Lambs: the proud became humble, the pa&s;&s;ionate became meek and gentle, the unclean became cha&s;te, the cruel became merciful, and the unju&s;t became hone&s;t. And being thus inwardly reformed, chang|ed, and converted, they became new crea|tures in their outward behaviour. Drunk|enne&s;s, uncleanne&s;s, and lying, gave place to &s;obriety, cha&s;tity, and truth. The mouths that formerly were filled with oaths, cur&s;es and bla&s;phemies, were filled with prayer and prai&s;e. The &s;abbaths that were former|ly broken and profaned, were now employ|ed in the &s;ervice of God. The time which was once &s;pent in gaming, idlene&s;s, and vain amu&s;ements, was now improved in reading, and holy meditation. And in the place of &s;ighting, cruelty, fraud and op|pre&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="27" REF="028549_0026_0FD94099CDE966C0">
there was ju&s;tice, mercy, and every good work.</P>
<P>Now that the Methodi&s;ts have been in|&s;trumental in thus reforming multitudes, is too notorious to be denied; yet if any doubt of it, let them go to King&s;wood, and Cornwall; let them go to Newca&s;tle, Coleford, Wedne&s;bury, and Whitehaven; let them go to Leeds, Sheffield, Manche&s;|ter, and Liverpool; let them go to Bir|mingham, Wolverhampton, and Che&s;ter; let them go to Norwich, Bath and Bri&s;tol: nay, let them only go to the mo&s;t wretch|ed parts of this metropolis, and they will &s;oon find abundant proof of all I have a&s;&s;erted; they will &s;oon be fully &s;atisfied, that multitudes in the&s;e places, who were once the reproach of Chri&s;tianity, the pe&s;ts of &s;ociety, the plagues of their neighbours, the cur&s;e of their families, and a &s;candal to human nature; are now &s;ober, holy, chri&s;|tian men.</P>
<P>Secondly, They have done Temporal good. Before the per&s;ons above referred to, heard the Methodi&s;ts, many of them were in a &s;tate of deplorable poverty and wretchedne&s;s: having neither food to eat, nor raiment to put on; nor always &s;o much as a little clean &s;traw to lie on. At the &s;ame time they were &s;o deeply in debt, and &s;o far from any likelihood of paying it,
<PB N="28" REF="028549_0027_0FD940A1ABBB9268">
that they had quite lo&s;t their credit: and had it not been for the humanity of their neighbours, and the &s;canty provi&s;ion made for them by the laws of their country, they and their families mu&s;t have peri&s;hed to|gether. As this was owing, partly to idle|ne&s;s, and partly to drunkenne&s;s, gaming, and other extravagancies; on hearing the Methodi&s;ts, and becoming earne&s;t in the work of their &s;alvation, there was an end of all the&s;e evils. The con&s;equence was, they &s;oon got food for them&s;elves and fa|milies: next a little plain, decent apparel; then a little nece&s;&s;ary furniture. Having thus procured a few nece&s;&s;aries, they began to pay their debts, and after awhile they owed no man any thing. Going on in the way of virtue, they continued to u&s;e all diligence and frugality. By the&s;e means, they were enabled to procure things a little more comfortable for them&s;elves, and now and then to &s;pare a little to the mo&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;itous. By &s;till continuing to u&s;e all di|ligence and frugality, they were enabled to enlarge their bounty. At length, having it in their power, they began to do good unto all men, e&s;pecially unto the hou&s;e|hold of faith. Nor did they overlook that word, Lend to him that would borrow of thee; for when it was proper and conveni|ent, they were now as willing to lend, as
<PB N="29" REF="028549_0028_0FD940A2B27407E8">
they were formerly to borrow of others. Still going on in the good way, they were &s;oon able to lay by a little for future con|tingencies. To this they added a little more: till at la&s;t many of them became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of hundreds, and &s;ome of them of many thou&s;ands. Now as the&s;e are facts which cannot be denied, I conclude that the Methodi&s;ts have done both Spiritual and Temporal good.</P>
<P>But, Secondly, what is the Extent of this good? What is the Number of tho&s;e who have been thus benefited by Methodi&s;m? To a&s;certain the exact number is impo&s;&s;ible to any child of man. None but God, who knoweth all things, can do this. All that we can do is, by a general calculation, to come as near the truth of the matter as po&s;&s;ible. And in order to this end, I &s;hall ob&s;erve, Fir&s;t, That there are above Ninety<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since the time of this debate, many thou&s;ands have been added to the Methodi&s;t Societies both in Europe and America.</NOTE> Thou&s;and members at this time in the different Societies under Mr. We&s;ley's care and we cannot &s;uppo&s;e there are le&s;s than Ten<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">One rea&s;on of the great di&s;proportion between the above number is, Mr. Whitefield never thought it his duty to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;ocieties wherever he preached, as Mr. We&s;ley did; nor, of cour&s;e, to encourage &s;o many preachers.</NOTE> Thou&s;and in the Societies in&s;tituted
<PB N="30" REF="028549_0029_0FD940A4483378D8">
by the late Mr. Whitefield: in all, about a Hundred Thou&s;and. Secondly, let us &s;up|po&s;e that in the long &s;pace of fifty or &s;ixty years, there could not be le&s;s than a Hundred Thou&s;and more, who from time to time, have formerly been members of the&s;e So|cieties: multitudes of whom have yearly been going to God; multitudes more who have continually been joining other religi|ous Societies; and va&s;t numbers who after enduring for awhile, went back into the world. Now very few, if any of the&s;e were &s;uffered to become Members of the&s;e So|cieties, without evident marks of having received &s;ome benefit by fir&s;t hearing the word: they were at lea&s;t, a little enlight|ened, and at the &s;ame time thoroughly re|formed in their outward behaviour. In|deed, the far greater part of them experi|enced a much deeper work; being more deeply awakened, and made much more in earne&s;t for their &s;alvation. Here then are Two Hundred Thou&s;and &s;ouls who have received good (&s;ome in one degree, and others in another) by means of Method|i&s;m.</P>
<P>Again, Tho&s;e who are con&s;tant and fre|quent hearers of the Methodi&s;ts, in town and country are (taking one place with another) about five times as many as tho&s;e who are members of the Societies. Now
<PB N="31" REF="028549_0030_0FD940AB2393D960">
the&s;e, one with another, have heard the Methodi&s;ts about twice a week. And we cannot &s;uppo&s;e that they have &s;o often heard that word which was made &s;o great a ble&s;|&s;ing to others, without receiving &s;ome ble&s;|&s;ing them&s;elves. Indeed many of them have received very material good, as their gene|ral behaviour abundantly &s;hews. And as to the re&s;t, if they were only enlightened and reformed a little, this, certainly is &s;ome good. Now when the&s;e are added to the former number, they make in all about Twelve Hundred Thou&s;and &s;ouls.</P>
<P>Add to the&s;e &s;uch us have been occa&s;ional hearers; and tho&s;e who have frequently vi|&s;ited Methodi&s;t families, where religious wor&s;hip, and Chri&s;tian conver&s;ation are kept up; and tho&s;e who have laboured or travelled with zealous Methodi&s;ts, or other|wi&s;e fallen into company with them, and have been in&s;tructed, exhorted, warned and admoni&s;hed by them, here mu&s;t be an ad|dition of very many thou&s;ands more to whom they have been of u&s;e.</P>
<P>Again, Suppo&s;e there has been only a &s;ingle Methodi&s;t in a family, and two or three in a neighbourhood, twenty or thirty in a country village, two or three hundred in a large trading town, and three or four times that number in a city; if each of the&s;e has been as a city upon a hill which
<PB N="32" REF="028549_0031_0FD940ACF5A8F428">
cannot be hid, and as a candle upon a can|dle&s;tick which gives light to all in the hou&s;e, Thou&s;ands, Tens of Thou&s;ands, Hundreds of Thou&s;ands, who have &s;een their good works, mu&s;t, &s;ooner or later, in &s;ome de|gree or other be benefited thereby.</P>
<P>Again, There have been (and &s;till are) many holy, u&s;eful mini&s;ters, both in the Church of England, and among the vari|ous &s;orts of Di&s;&s;enters, who&s;e religion (and con&s;equently their u&s;efulne&s;s) originated with the Methodi&s;ts. Now as the&s;e have frequently been of u&s;e in enlightening, re|claiming, and converting &s;inners, this mu&s;t (under God) be attributed to the Metho|di&s;ts. For in all likelihood, if the&s;e mini|&s;ters had never heard the Methodi&s;ts, they would not have been converted; and if they had not been converted, they had never been in&s;trumental in doing the good they have; of con&s;equence the main of their u&s;efulne&s;s, if not every tittle of it pro|ceeded from the Methodi&s;ts.</P>
<P>Again, In the cour&s;e of fifty years many religious books have been publi&s;hed by the Methodi&s;ts, and others who &s;prung from them. Now as the&s;e in general are not only argumentative, but likewi&s;e plain, practical, and per&s;ua&s;ive; they have been of un&s;peak|able &s;ervice to multitudes. And as it has often happened that they have fallen into
<PB N="33" REF="028549_0032_0FD940AE078CE068">
the hands of a great variety of per&s;ons, at home and abroad, who never heard the Methodi&s;ts, or conver&s;ed with them&punc; we have rea&s;on to believe, both from the na|ture of the books, and from the good ef|fects we have known them to have had up|on others, that many of the&s;e have been much benefited by reading them. Nor is this mere conjecture; for we have known many in&s;tances even of per&s;ons of character who have been very materially benefited by reading Mr. We&s;ley's Appeals, Sermons, and various other Tracts.</P>
<P>Again, We all know that in St. Paul's days there was tho&s;e who preached Chri&s;t out of contention, and that the apo&s;tle re|joiced therein; not doubting but good was done thereby. In like manner, when the Methodi&s;ts made a noi&s;e in the world, many of the Clergy began to be&s;tir them&s;elves, and took much more pains both in preach|ing and living. Nor is this mere imagi|nation; for we have known many in&s;tances of this kind in every part of the three king|doms. Now as we mu&s;t believe that much good has been done, even by this means, and as we are certain that Methodi&s;m gave occa&s;ion to it; we mu&s;t view it as a farther di&s;play of the good the Methodi&s;ts have done.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="028549_0033_0FD940B33444E3D0">Once more, He who &s;ays a firm founda|tion whereon to build a &s;tately edifice, or plants a large vineyard, which promi&s;es a fruitful vintage, or &s;ows an exten&s;ive field which almo&s;t a&s;&s;ures us of a plentiful har|ve&s;t; certainly does good. Now all this the Methodi&s;ts have done. They have laid &s;uch a firm foundation; they have planted &s;uch a large vineyard; they have cultivated and &s;own &s;o wide a field; by enlightening, reforming, and converting &s;o many Thou|&s;ands and tens of Thou&s;ands, that if they go on, as hitherto they have done, ages unborn, and nations who never yet &s;o much as heard of their name, will ble&s;s God in Time and Eternity, that &s;uch a people ever exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>Seeing then that the Methodi&s;ts have been in&s;trumental in doing Spiritual and Temporal good, in a higher or lower de|gree, to Thou&s;ands of Thou&s;ands; and &s;ee|ing they have laid a broad and firm found|ation for a much greater work in futurity; I conclude that they have done Good, and not Evil; and that they have done it in a mo&s;t marvellous degree.</P>
<P>Perhaps it may be worth while to &s;ubjoin a few &s;hort an&s;wers to &s;everal objections urg|ed again&s;t the Methodi&s;ts on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, It has been &s;aid, "They are En|thu&s;ia&s;ts, in pretending to receive the Spi|rit,
<PB N="35" REF="028549_0034_0FD940B707D54790">
and to be influenced thereby." I an|&s;wer, They make no pretence but to the ordinary operations of the Spirit: which is nothing more than what every Chri&s;tian Church under the heavens does, in its Li|turgies, Articles, Creed, Catechi&s;ms and Confe&s;&s;ions: particularly, the Church of England, Scotland, and Ireland; with e|very body of Di&s;&s;enters in the&s;e lands. If then the Methodi&s;ts are Enthu&s;ia&s;ts on this account, &s;o al&s;o is the whole Chri&s;tian World.</P>
<P>Secondly, It was &s;aid, "They are un|charitable, in confining Salvation to them|&s;elves." To this I an&s;wer, They do no &s;uch thing. What they believe, and &s;ay, is this: every one that repents of his &s;ins, believes in Chri&s;t, and loves God and his neighbour, will be &s;aved, whatever Church he is of. And on the other hand, he that does not thus repent, believe, and love, he, and he only, they &s;ay will be damned. All the clamour, therefore, concerning the un|charitablene&s;s of the Methodi&s;ts, concern|ing their confining &s;alvation to them&s;elves, and damning all be&s;ides, is mere Slander and Abu&s;e, as every one knows who has e|ver heard them.</P>
<P>Thirdly, It was &s;aid, "There are very wicked per&s;ons among them." I an&s;wer, There never was a Chri&s;tian church on earth,
<PB N="36" REF="028549_0035_0FD940B8F234BCC8">
con&s;i&s;ting of fifty members, who &s;ooner or later, had not tho&s;e among them who did not adorn their profe&s;&s;ion. In the Apo&s;tles' time they had Spots in their fea&s;ts of Cha|rity; and even among the Twelve, who were in the clo&s;e&s;t connexion with our Lord, there was one who had a devil. It would be &s;trange, therefore if in a body con&s;i&s;ting of a Hundred Thou&s;and members, there &s;hould be none who walked in a di&s;orderly manner. But &s;uppo&s;e there were fifty that did &s;o, this would not be enough to crimi|nate the whole body, &s;eeing &s;uch are in no wi&s;e allowed among them. For when a per&s;on of that &s;ort is di&s;covered, if they can|not reclaim him, they cut him off as a with|ered branch, according to the word of Chri&s;t, and the example of his Apo&s;tles. If he repent they receive him again; if not, he is no more admitted into their So|cieties. Now here I a&s;k, Does every Chri&s;|tian Church under the heavens do this? Do tho&s;e in Great Britain and Ireland? If not, with what face can tho&s;e who do it not, find fault with the Methodi&s;ts in this re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Fourthly, It has been &s;aid, "They make u&s;e of very uncouth and ab&s;urd expre&s;|&s;ions." I an&s;wer, Perhaps they &s;ometimes may. And is this to be wondered at? Would it not rather be a wonder, if every
<PB N="37" REF="028549_0036_0FD940BCA2EECF60">
member of &s;uch a community &s;hould al|ways expre&s;s him&s;elf with the utmo&s;t ac|curacy? Was &s;uch a thing ever known a|mong any other people? "But the preach|ers them&s;elves u&s;e uncouth expre&s;&s;ions." Perhaps they may, and perhaps they may not. It has &s;ometimes happened that the un|couthne&s;s was in the ears of tho&s;e who heard them. For though St. Paul had been &s;peaking the words of Truth and So|berne&s;s, &s;o uncouth were the ears of Fe&s;tus, that he cried out, Paul! thou art be&s;ide thy&s;elf; much learning hath made thee mad. And though the Son of God had been &s;peaking as never man &s;poke, yet &s;ome who heard him, and tho&s;e too of the mo&s;t reputable &s;ort, &s;aid, He is mad and hath a devil; why hear ye him? "But there are ab&s;urd expre&s;&s;ions in the Methodi&s;t-wri|tings." I an&s;wer, Was there ever a Book written wherein an evil eye could not di&s;|cover an ab&s;urdity? Is even the book of God free in this re&s;pect? Rather have not the infidels of all ages beheld it as nothing but a heap of Ab&s;urdities and Contradic|tions! What wonder then if the Methodi&s;t-writings are viewed in the &s;ame unfavour|able light?</P>
<P>Fifthly, It is objected; that, "They are divided among them&s;elves, and often con|demn each other with great &s;everity." I
<PB N="38" REF="028549_0037_0FD940BE76109380">
an&s;wer, Then this is one argument in their favour. For it proves that they are &s;o far hone&s;t men, as not to be in league to de|ceive the world. But they are not divided in any thing e&s;&s;ential. They are perfectly agreed, That the whole world lieth in wickedne&s;s: that God commandeth all men every where to repent: that there is &s;alvation in none but Chri&s;t: that all who believe are ju&s;tified, and have peace with God: that all &s;uch ought to love God and their neighbour; and to rejoice evermore, pray without cea&s;ing, and in every thing give thanks; and to be holy in heart, and in life. "But &s;ome of them are Armini|ans, and others Calvini&s;ts." This is very true. The followers of Mr. We&s;ley are, in general, Arminians; and the followers of the late Mr Whitefield are, in general, Calvini&s;ts. But what for that! Is &s;uch a di|vi&s;ion any thing new or extraordinary? Was there not, at lea&s;t &s;ince the days of St. Au&s;tin, a mixture of tho&s;e who are now called Calvini&s;ts and Arminians, I will not &s;ay, in every Chri&s;tian nation, or Chri&s;tian city; but in every Chri&s;tian congregation of any note? Is it not &s;o now all over Eng|land, Scotland, Ireland, Holland, France, Spain, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Italy, America, and in the Ea&s;t and We&s;t-Indies? If &s;o, where is the harm if &s;uch a divi&s;ion
<PB N="39" REF="028549_0038_0FD940C174E3E6D8">
is &s;ound among the Methodi&s;ts? "But they bitterly condemn each other." I an|&s;wer, Sometimes they do; but not in ge|neral. And if they did it oftener, it would be no wonder, &s;eeing &s;o great a majority of mankind are incapable of viewing any point with liberality and candour. This frailty of human nature, has been matter of lamen|tation to candid men in every age and na|tion; but not more &s;o than to thou&s;ands of both parties which con&s;titute "The Me|thodi&s;ts."</P>
<P>Sixthly, It is &s;aid, "The teachers of Methodi&s;m are a company of illiterate me|chanics." I an&s;wer, They are not more illiterate than the Prophets and Apo&s;tles&punc; they are not more illiterate than the teachers of various other denominations; &s;uch as the Quakers, Anabapti&s;ts, Moravians, and &s;ome Independents: they are not more illi|terate than &s;ome who have been ordained mini&s;ters of the Church of England, who did not &s;o much as know a Verb from a Noun: particularly the Rev. Mr. T. who was originally a Merry-andrew, then a Dea|con, then a Prie&s;t, then a Ju&s;tice of the Peace, if not of the Quorum!</P>
<P>Again, They are not more illiterate, or more ignorant of the laws of God, than Thou&s;ands of Magi&s;trates are of the laws of their country: particularly than multi|tudes
<PB N="40" REF="028549_0039_0FD940C75C1F91D8">
of Mayors and Aldermen, who have the care, not only of our corporate towns, but even of our Cities! Now if an illite|rate Magi&s;trate, by looking into the Statute-Laws, can tell what is legal and illegal; what pains and puni&s;hments belong to evil-doers, and what prai&s;e to them that do well; why may not a Methodi&s;t teacher (&s;uppo&s;e he is equally illiterate) by looking into the Laws of God, tell what is requir|ed therein, on the one hand, and what for|bidden on the other; and al&s;o what Re|wards and Puni&s;hments belong to obedience and di&s;obedience? And if he <HI>declares</HI> what the&s;e rewards and puni&s;hments are, and adds warnings, in&s;tructions and exhortati|ons, this is nothing more than what is con|&s;tantly done, by every illiterate Magi&s;trate in the world.</P>
<P>Again, They are not more illiterate than myrrads of tho&s;e who are heads of families, who are &s;uppo&s;ed to be able to in&s;truct all under their care, in the duties they owe to God, their neighbours and one another; and to make u&s;e of arguments, warnings, and exhortations, to engage their whole hou&s;ehold to love and fear God, and live in obedience to the king, and in love and charity with their neighbours. Now if e|very ma&s;ter of a family is &s;uppo&s;ed (without the help of a univer&s;ity education) to be
<PB N="41" REF="028549_0040_0FD940C840857410">
capable of doing this; why may we not &s;uppo&s;e a Methodi&s;t teacher capable of doing the &s;ame, when Five, Ten, Twenty or Fifty families are met together?</P>
<P>But after all this noi&s;e about their illite|racy, it is well known there have been men of very con&s;iderable learning among them from the beginning: men who have had a re|gular education, and who have acquired con|&s;iderable renown, even in our univer&s;ities. There have al&s;o been others, who in the cour&s;e of thirty or forty years, have made them&s;elves well acquainted with the learned languages; with polemical and practical divi|nity, and with various other arts and &s;cien|ces. And as for the re&s;t, &s;eeing they have been wi&s;e to win &s;ouls, they need not re|gard who clamours again&s;t them; as he is the be&s;t Phy&s;ician who performs the mo&s;t cures.</P>
<P>But, "They are mechanics." So were Kings and Prophets, under the law; &s;o was Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, under the Go&s;pel; &s;o were Bi&s;hops, Prie&s;ts and Deacons in former times; and &s;o were many who now bear &s;ome of the highe&s;t offices, both in Church and State. If then it is no objec|tion to the&s;e that they were once mechan|ics; where is the Candour? Where is the Ju&s;tice of urging it again&s;t the Methodi&s;ts? E&s;pecially as it is no where &s;aid in the Bible,
<PB N="42" REF="028549_0041_0FD940C9C73D5138">
that every preacher of the Go&s;pel mu&s;t be a fine Gentleman.</P>
<P>Seventhly, "But the teachers of Method|i&s;m are idle, mercenary men." I an&s;wer, As they generally ride, through all wea|thers, three, four, and &s;ometimes five thou|&s;and miles a year; and, in that time preach, with all their might, five, &s;ix, &s;even or eight hundred &s;ermons; be&s;ides giving near as ma|ny public exhortations, vi&s;iting the &s;ick, and &s;peaking to every member under their care, four or five times a year; writing letters, and enforcing every other part of the Me|thodi&s;t di&s;cipline; it is impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould be idle. On the other hand, I know from long experience, that there are few ways of life attended with more fatigue, and &s;o likely to de&s;troy a good con&s;titution, as that of a preacher among the Method|i&s;ts. I my&s;elf have often been &s;o wearied with the labours of a &s;ingle Sabbath, that I could &s;carce &s;leep at all the fir&s;t night, but imperfectly the &s;econd, and not &s;oundly till the third. Now I a&s;k every impartial man, if this is a life of Idlene&s;s, who&s;e is a life of Labour? who&s;e is a life of Toil?</P>
<P>But, "They are mercenary: their aim is only to enrich them&s;elves." I an&s;wer, if this was really their aim, never were men more di&s;appointed. For I defy any man living to &s;hew &s;o much as a &s;ingle preach|er
<PB N="43" REF="028549_0042_0FD940CDE377ECF0">
who has enriched him&s;elf, even by preaching for the long &s;pace of forty or fifty years. It is true, a few of them (per|haps one in ten) have got a little by mar|riage, though perhaps, not a quarter, or a tenth part of what they would have done, had they &s;taid at home. And as to the re&s;t, it is known to thou&s;ands, that they never aimed at more than a &s;canty allowance to provide plain food and raiment for the pre|&s;ent; and if they got it (which was not al|ways the ca&s;e) they were therewith con|tent.</P>
<P>And as a farther proof of their not being mercenary men, I add, had they been &s;uch, would God have owned their labours as he has done? Was it ever known, from the beginning of the world, that impo&s;tors and deceivers turned thou&s;ands upon thou|&s;ands from the evil of their way? Did any of this &s;ort ever go, with their lives in their hands, to the mo&s;t ignorant, daring, and &s;avage people; and &s;o preach Chri&s;t to them, as to con&s;train them to for|&s;ake all their &s;ins, to turn to God with full purpo&s;e of heart, and to walk in the narrow way, the way of holine&s;s, to their lives end? Yet all this have the Teachers of Methodi&s;m been doing for forty or fifty years together, in the face of the &s;un; and all this they &s;till continue to do with unremitted zeal, not|with&s;tanding
<PB N="44" REF="028549_0043_0FD940D204F50EE8">
the many ob&s;tacles which are thrown in their way. We mu&s;t therefore conclude that they are not a &s;et of deceiv|ers, but holy and di&s;intere&s;ted men, &s;ent of God to reform a guilty generation.</P>
