<P>THE miracles wrought by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, when he entered on his public min|i&s;try, commanded general attention among the Jews, and engaged them to inquire con|cerning his per&s;on, and the de&s;ign of his coming into the world. Nicodemus, a Phari&s;ee, and a man of high rank in I&s;rael, came to Je&s;us, by night, to learn from his mouth the nature of his doctrine and king|dom. The addre&s;s of this Jewi&s;h ruler was
<PB N="6" REF="036872_0005_100B26DC84EB8198">in terms of high re&s;pect&mdash;<HI>Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God; for no man can do the&s;e miracles that thou doe&s;t, ex|cept God be with him.</HI> The Saviour <HI>an&s;wered and &s;aid unto him, Verily, verily, I &s;ay unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot &s;ee the kingdom of God.</HI> He who is <HI>the faithful and true Witne&s;s,</HI> repeats the word <HI>verily,</HI> to give greater weight, and to excite higher attention, to the truth he utters. Let our ears and our hearts be open, to learn the nature and nece&s;&s;ity of the change of which he di&s;cour&s;eth in the pa&s;&s;age before us.</P>
<P>IT is evident that &s;ome change is inten|ded by being <HI>born again;</HI> and that this, in whatever it con&s;i&s;ts, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the entrance of any individual of the human race into <HI>the kingdom of God.</HI> In the text, <HI>man</HI> is u&s;ed indefinitely; it is as ap|plicable to the Jew as to the Gentile, and to per&s;ons of one nation, age, or rank, as another.</P>
<P>To be born again, mu&s;t mean &s;omething beyond mere external reformation; for if it did not, Nicodemus would not have ex|pre&s;&s;ed his &s;urpri&s;e, as we find he did, at what Chri&s;t taught. Not only the Phari|&s;ees, but even Pagans, urged the nece&s;&s;ity of breaking off from vice, and becoming pure in outward behavior, to &s;ecure the
<PB N="7" REF="036872_0006_100B26DECFE50BC8">friend&s;hip and ble&s;&s;ing of the Deity. How|ever di&s;agreed mankind have been concern|ing the nature of virtue, and whatever vices they have patronized by their doctrines, or recommended by their examples, they have always in their creeds <HI>profe&s;&s;ed</HI> to recom|mend purity of morals.</P>
<P>THERE is nothing in the text, taken in its connexion, to countenance the opinion of &s;ome ancient and modern Chri&s;tian wri|ters, that the ordinance of <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> is the principal thing intended by being born again. A view of the context will refute this opinion, as well as that of tho&s;e who extend the new birth to nothing beyond common morality. <HI>Nicodemus &s;aith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter the &s;econd time into his mother's womb, and be born? Je&s;us an&s;wered, Verily, verily, I &s;ay unto thee, except a man be born of water, and of the &s;pirit, he cannot enter into the king|dom of God. That which is born of the fle&s;h is fle&s;h; and that which is born of the &s;pirit is &s;pirit. Marvel not that I &s;aid unto thee, Ye mu&s;t be born again. The wind bloweth where it li&s;teth, and thou heare&s;t the &s;ound thereof, but can&s;t not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth; &s;o is every one that is born of the &s;pirit. Nicodemus an&s;wered and &s;aid unto him, How can the&s;e things be?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="036872_0007_100B26E091415008">
THE rite of Chri&s;tian bapti&s;m, in which the adult, or the infant, is wa&s;hed with wa|ter in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t, teaches by an ad|dre&s;s to our &s;en&s;es, the ab&s;olute need of an internal change, or of being regenerated, to qualify for the enjoyment of God: But the admini&s;tration of this ordinance doth not purify the heart, nor can we certainly determine that the per&s;on baptized, is a &s;ub|ject of that holine&s;s without which no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord. Bapti&s;m is of high im|portance, and no one can <HI>de&s;pi&s;e</HI> it without bringing great guilt upon him&s;elf; but we have no authority to affirm that every un|baptized per&s;on will be eternally lo&s;t. Af|ter Chri&s;t had ri&s;en from the dead, he &s;aid unto his apo&s;tles, in Mark xvi. 15, 16&mdash; <HI>Go ye into all the world, and preach the go&s;pel to every creature, he that believeth and is bap|tized, &s;hall be &s;aved; but he that believeth not &s;hall be damned.</HI> From the&s;e words we can determine that every one who &s;pends his whole life in unbelief will be damned; but not that every unbaptized per&s;on will be doomed to everla&s;ting mi&s;ery. We cannot be ju&s;tified in excluding every unbaptized per&s;on from Heaven, unle&s;s it had been in|&s;erted in Chri&s;t's declaration, or &s;omewhere el&s;e in the &s;criptures, that "he who be|lieveth not, <HI>and is not baptized,</HI> &s;hall be for
<PB N="9" REF="036872_0008_100B26E24E8AF238">mi&s;erable." Some may be deprived of bapti&s;m without any fault of theirs; and others may have &s;uch con&s;cientious &s;cruples as to prevent their receiving this ordinance, and yet may be members of Chri&s;t's my&s;|tical body. No unbaptized per&s;on can be a member of the <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> church, according to the form under which it appears in the New-Te&s;tament. To the bapti&s;mal wa&s;hing Chri&s;t probably alludes when he &s;peaketh, in the context, of being <HI>born of water.</HI></P>
<P>WERE nothing more meant by being born of water than the bapti&s;mal dedication, why &s;hould Nicodemus &s;ay, <HI>How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter the &s;ec|ond time into his mother's womb and be born?</HI> If water bapti&s;m be the new birth taught in the text, how could Nicodemus have re|mained &s;o ignorant and perplexed, after Chri&s;t had explained its nature? The &s;ur|pri&s;e of this Jewi&s;h ruler remained through|out the conference, and he exclaimed <HI>How can the&s;e things be!</HI> He well knew that, from the days of Abraham, none had been ad|mitted into the vi&s;ible church without &s;ub|mitting to circumci&s;ion: And if he &s;uppo|&s;ed that Chri&s;t only meant to change the &s;eal of the covenant, or to put bapti&s;m in the place of circumci&s;ion, what could there
<PB N="10" REF="036872_0009_100B26E479A95270">have been in this &s;o my&s;terious to his mind? Be&s;ides, as is generally allowed, bapti&s;m had long before the coming of Chri&s;t, been admini&s;tered to Gentile pro&s;elytes, on their admi&s;&s;ion into the Jewi&s;h church. His knowledge of this fact would have render|ed bapti&s;m yet more familiar. We do not find in all the New-Te&s;tament that the u&s;e of this ordinance excited wonder; as it mu&s;t have done if it had been a practice wholly without a precedent among the Jews. The prie&s;ts and the levites whom the Jews &s;ent to John, to enquire who he was, a&s;ked him, <HI>Why baptize&s;t thou then, if thou be not that Chri&s;t, nor Elias, neither that prophet!</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John i. 25.</NOTE> It is plain that they did not inquire concern|ing bapti&s;m as a rite, but why <HI>he</HI> baptized. It &s;eems that they expected the Me&s;&s;iah would baptize when he &s;hould appear.</P>
<P>IF bapti&s;m be &s;uppo&s;ed to be the only re|generation taught in the text, we &s;hall find our&s;elves involved in in&s;uperable difficulties, in reconciling it with the other words which pa&s;&s;ed between Chri&s;t and Nicodemus. In addition to what has been &s;aid, it may be ob&s;erved, that the new birth which our Lord inculcates, is attributed to the Holy Gho&s;t as its author: <HI>Except a man be born of the &s;pirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="036872_0010_100B26E79C63E9F0">To be <HI>born of the &s;pirit,</HI> is the &s;ame thing with the renovation of the heart by the &s;pirit of God. This change is the effect of a di|vine operation on the heart. The nece&s;&s;ity of it is derived from man's moral pollution&mdash;<HI>That which is born of the fle&s;h is fle&s;h.</HI> Ho|line&s;s is introduced into the heart of apo&s;|tate man, only by the &s;pirit of God&mdash;<HI>That which is born of the &s;pirit is &s;pirit.</HI> In the manner of the &s;pirit's operation on the heart there is &s;omething which we cannot compre|hend; which operation Chri&s;t compareth to the blowing of the wind. But what is there either in the admini&s;tration of the or|dinance of bapti&s;m, or in the practice of common morality, that is my&s;terious?</P>
<P>THE new birth inculcated in the text, con&s;i&s;teth in the turning of the heart from &s;in to holine&s;s. It is in con&s;equence of this change that any one of the human race be|cometh a child of God by faith in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P>BY the phra&s;e, <HI>the kingdom of God,</HI> in the pa&s;&s;age before us, cannot be primarily meant the vi&s;ible church, nor the New-Te&s;tament di&s;pen&s;ation; becau&s;e many have been in the kingdom of God in the&s;e &s;en&s;es, who were his enemies, and remained &s;o through life. The kingdom of God is here to be under|&s;tood as including the &s;tate of grace into
<PB N="12" REF="036872_0011_100B26EAF7C2B050">which the regenerate are brought, in the pre&s;ent world, and the &s;tate of glory pre|pared for them in the world to come. In this &s;en&s;e the phra&s;e is often u&s;ed in the &s;crip|tures. Luke vi. 20. <HI>And he lifted up his eyes on his di&s;ciples, and &s;aid, ble&s;&s;ed are ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.</HI> Rom. xiv. 17. <HI>For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteou&s;ne&s;s, and peace, and joy in the Ho|ly Gho&s;t.</HI> 1 Cor. xv. 50. <HI>Fle&s;h and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.</HI> None can <HI>&s;ee</HI> the kingdom of God, or enjoy its ble&s;|&s;ings, except tho&s;e who are born again.</P>
<P>THE words of Chri&s;t in the text, lead us to con&s;ider the nature and nece&s;&s;ity of re|generation.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to the method propo&s;ed I &s;hall begin with inquiring into the nature of regeneration. I &s;hall,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. INTRODUCE &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages from the &s;criptures, as a guide in the intere&s;t|ing &s;ubject before us. Deut. xxx. 6. <HI>And the Lord thy God will circumci&s;e thine heart, and the heart of thy &s;eed, to love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy &s;oul, that thou maye&s;t live.</HI> P&s;alm li. 10. <HI>Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right &s;pirit within me.</HI> Jerem. xxiv. 7. <HI>And I will give them an heart to know me,
<PB N="13" REF="036872_0012_100B26ED32175188">that I am the Lord; and they &s;hall be my people, and I will be their God: for they &s;hall return unto me with their whole heart.</HI> xxxi. 33. <HI>But this &s;hall be the covenant that I will make with the hou&s;e of I&s;rael; after tho&s;e days, &s;aith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they &s;hall be my people.</HI> Ezek. xxxvi. 25, 26, 27. <HI>Then will I &s;prinkle clean water upon you and ye &s;hall be clean: from all your filthine&s;s, and from all your idols, will I clean&s;e you. A new heart al&s;o will I give you, and a new &s;pirit will I put within you; and I will take away the &s;tony heart out of your fle&s;h, and I will give you an heart of fle&s;h. And I will put my &s;pirit within you, and cau&s;e you to walk in my &s;tatutes, and ye &s;hall keep my judg|ments, and do them.</HI></P>
<P>I APPEAL to every candid reader of the &s;criptures, whether it be po&s;&s;ible, by any fair interpretation, to under&s;tand by the foregoing texts le&s;s than a complete change of character, or a new temper of mind. Hence appears the propriety of Chri&s;t's &s;ay|ing to Nicodemus, <HI>Art thou a ma&s;ter of I&s;rael, and knowe&s;t not the&s;e things?</HI> "Are you a teacher of high rank among the Jews, and are you &s;o blind, as not to know that the &s;criptures, which you profe&s;s to be able to explain, abound with the doctrine of the
<PB N="14" REF="036872_0013_100B26F2036527E8">new birth which I am inculcating? Why do you &s;tumble at the nece&s;&s;ity of this change, by a divine operation, &s;ince it is &s;o clearly revealed in the oracles God?"</P>
<P>I WILL now introduce a few texts from the New-Te&s;tament on the &s;ubject before us. John i. 12, 13. <HI>But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the &s;ons of God, even to them that believe on his name. Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the fle&s;h, nor of the will of man, but of God.</HI> 2 Cor. iv. 16. <HI>For God, who commanded the light to &s;hine out of darkne&s;s, hath &s;hined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> Eph. ii. 10. <HI>For we are his workman&s;hip, created in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we &s;hould walk in them.</HI> iv. 24. <HI>And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteou&s;ne&s;s and true ho|line&s;s.</HI> 1 John v. 18. <HI>We know that who&s;oever is born of God &s;inneth not: but he that is begot|ten of God keepeth him&s;elf, and that wicked one toucheth him not.</HI> Titus iii. 5. <HI>Not by works of righteou&s;ne&s;s which we have done, but according to his mercy he &s;aved us, by the wa&s;hing of re|generation, and renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>MAY not every one be convinced by this &s;election of a few pa&s;&s;ages, out of many, recorded in the Jewi&s;h and Chri&s;tian &s;crip|tures,
<PB N="15" REF="036872_0014_100B26F4F3D43810">that an e&s;&s;ential change of heart is ef|fected in regeneration? God circumci&s;eth the heart to love him.&mdash;He giveth the regen|erate a heart to know him.&mdash;He putteth his law in their inward parts, and writeth it in their heart.&mdash;He giveth them a new heart and a new &s;pirit.&mdash;He putteth his &s;pirit with|in them.&mdash;He cau&s;eth them to walk in his &s;tatutes.&mdash;They who believe on the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, are born not of blood, nor of the will of the fle&s;h, nor of the will of man, but of God.&mdash;He hath &s;hined in their hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of his glory in the face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.&mdash;The re|generate are God's workman&s;hip, created in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto good works. They put on the new man, which after God is crea|ted in righteou&s;ne&s;s and true holine&s;s.&mdash;They are begotten of God: And through his mercy they are &s;aved by the wa&s;hing of re|generation, and renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P>FROM the account of this change which hath been taken from the word of truth, it appears that God operateth on the heart by his &s;pirit, previou&s;ly to its holy exertions, and that all its exerci&s;es are the effects of this divine operation. God worketh in the &s;aved both to will and to do. Hence many divines have, with propriety, made a di&s;|tinction between regeneration and conver|&s;ion: meaning by the fir&s;t, the energy of
<PB N="16" REF="036872_0015_100B26F6784AEB50">the holy &s;pirit in changing the heart; and by the la&s;t, the holy exerci&s;es of the heart which follow; &s;uch as love, repentance, faith, and other graces. Certainly the tree mu&s;t be made good, before its fruit can be good: And as the unregenerate are wholly without holine&s;s, it is evident that when it is found in any man, it mu&s;t be attributed to the holy &s;pirit, as its author. In con|ver&s;ion men are active, and are as free in turning to God as in any exerci&s;es what|ever. The peculiar energy of the Deity which giveth birth to holine&s;s in creatures is as reconcileable with their freedom, as his energy which extends to the common actions of life. Man was a moral agent when he was fir&s;t created. He was not brought into exi&s;tence without any charac|ter, or with a heart clear from any moral bias, like a piece of paper which has noth|ing written upon it. Man was not only in|nocent, or clear from &s;in, but he was po&s;i|tively holy. Eccl. vii. 29. <HI>Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have &s;ought out many inventions.</HI> If the divine power which created man holy at fir&s;t, did not impair his freedom as a moral agent, the divine power which createth ho|line&s;s in the heart of any individual of Ad|am's po&s;terity, in any period of his exi&s;t|ence, does not impair his freedom. The
<PB N="17" REF="036872_0016_100B26F8C50483F0">objection brought again&s;t the doctrine of regeneration, on the ground of its de&s;troy|ing man's freedom, goes to the denial of all created holine&s;s, and con&s;equently to a denial that Adam was holy in the fir&s;t mo|ment of his exi&s;tence.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. REGENERATION hath its &s;eat in the <HI>heart,</HI> or the temper of the mind. This has already been ob&s;erved, but it de&s;erves a more particular con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>ALL men, whether good or bad, are ca|pable of di&s;tingui&s;hing between holine&s;s and &s;in, and of knowing their duty. This fac|ulty is called <HI>The Under&s;tanding.</HI> The plea&s;|ure or the pain which the mind feels in a review of its actions, is &s;tiled <HI>The Con&s;cience.</HI> This, in &s;ome in&s;tances, operates to a high degree, in the wor&s;t of men while in the pre&s;ent life, and will be like a worm that never dies, to the impenitent in the world to come. A power of choo&s;ing or refu&s;ing, is al&s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed both by the righteous and the wicked, which is called <HI>The Will.</HI> The moral exerci&s;es of the mind are according to a certain bias, or ta&s;te, which is called <HI>The Heart.</HI> As this is holy or &s;inful, men are holy or &s;inful in their volitions. In this bias, or ta&s;te, are included <HI>The Affections;</HI> which may be &s;ummed up in love and hatred.
<PB N="18" REF="036872_0017_100B26FB463176E8">The good man reli&s;hes the beauty of God's moral character, and choo&s;es to &s;erve him. The wicked man has an oppo&s;ite reli&s;h, and choo&s;es to di&s;obey him.</P>
<P>A MINUTE delineation of the faculties and operations of the human mind, does not fall within my pre&s;ent de&s;ign. All will admit a di&s;tinction between a capacity to know what is right, and a di&s;po&s;ition either to conform, or not conform to it. The &s;criptures proceed on the ground of this di&s;tinction, and that it is admitted by man|kind. Under the fir&s;t head of this general divi&s;ion of the mind, are included the un|der&s;tanding and the con&s;cience; and under the la&s;t, the moral ta&s;te, the will, and the affections. The&s;e three la&s;t compo&s;e the <HI>heart.</HI> By keeping in view the definitions ju&s;t given, my meaning may be gathered when either of the&s;e words occur in the fol|lowing di&s;cour&s;es.</P>
<P>WERE man de&s;titute of a capacity of di&s;tingui&s;hing between holine&s;s and &s;in, and of voluntary action with re&s;pect to them, he could not be a &s;ubject of moral govern|ment, he could not be accountable to the &s;upreme Judge, nor would he have any thing to hope or fear from the retributions of eternity. However man's rea&s;oning powers may be impaired, or whatever dark|ne&s;s
<PB N="19" REF="036872_0018_100B26FDF4C2F928">may be thrown upon them by &s;in, or however hardened con&s;cience may become by long re&s;i&s;ting its dictates, his general capacity remains. He retains his place in the &s;cale of being; and will be rewarded, or puni&s;hed, agreeable to the law of recti|tude. He does not by his revolt lo&s;e his re|lation to God, nor to his neighbor: neither are his obligations in the lea&s;t dimini&s;hed to love the former with all his heart, and the latter as him&s;elf. The tran&s;gre&s;&s;or can do nothing which makes the &s;malle&s;t approach towards the annihilation of his intelligent nature; nor can he do any thing which will either overthrow, or weaken, the principles on which God governs his creatures. Sin con&s;i&s;ts in a wrong di&s;po&s;ition, or temper, of mind. It involves in its nature rebellion again&s;t the order which God hath e&s;tabli&s;hed in the moral world, and could its wi&s;hes be accompli&s;hed, Jehovah would cea&s;e to &s;it on the throne of the univer&s;e. The unregene|rate are not under the &s;ame kind of inabil|ity of loving and &s;erving God, as a deaf man is of hearing &s;ounds, or as a blind man is of di&s;cerning colours; but their inability ari&s;es from a heart which is oppo&s;ed both to the law and the go&s;pel. Hence we may &s;ee that their inability is of a criminal na|ture, and that the higher it ri&s;es, the more de&s;erving they are of the divine wrath.</P>

THE heart, or the temper of the mind, is changed in regeneration. There is noth|ing in this change which re&s;embles the tran&s;|formation of a plant into a living thinking creature, or of the bea&s;ts of the field into men. The de&s;ign of it is to re&s;tore the holy temper which was lo&s;t by the apo&s;tacy. To the regenerate is imparted a di&s;po&s;ition which harmonizes with the place which man holds in the family of the great Parent and Lord of all. The &s;ubjects of the new birth do not a&s;pire to the rank of angels, nor repine at the lower grade a&s;&s;igned them by infinite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s. Their great or their &s;mall rea&s;oning powers, their igno|rance of the arts and &s;ciences, or their ac|quaintance with them, remain as before: their hearts only are immediately affected by regeneration.</P>
<P>THE unregenerate are &s;ometimes de&s;cri|bed in &s;cripture as having the <HI>under&s;tanding</HI> darkened; but this ari&s;es from the <HI>blindne&s;s of their heart.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eph. iv. 18.</NOTE> Under the influence of a corrupt temper the beauty of holine&s;s is not di&s;cerned. The <HI>knowledge,</HI> or the <HI>under|&s;tanding,</HI> or the <HI>light,</HI> given in regeneration, immediately re&s;pects the moral &s;tate of the mind. The regenerate emerge from dark|ne&s;s into light by receiving a new heart:
<PB N="21" REF="036872_0020_100B27026402B060">they now become the &s;ubjects of divine il|lumination.</P>
<P>As in the &s;criptures all the faculties of the &s;oul are con&s;idered as receiving their moral complexion from the heart, deprav|ity is &s;ometimes predicated of them all. For the &s;ame rea&s;on a change of heart is repre|&s;ented as &s;etting the whole &s;oul right, and as extending its influence even to the body. But neither our corporeal members, nor our e&s;&s;ential faculties as moral agents, are the immediate &s;eat of holine&s;s or &s;in. They are holy or &s;inful according to the end to which they are devoted by the heart. When any are regenerated they <HI>glorify God in their body, and in their &s;pirit.</HI> Hence babes in divine knowledge are pre&s;erved from de|&s;tructive delu&s;ions, and are trained up for the kingdom of glory; while men of the world, of &s;trong mental powers, and high attainments in &s;cience, are &s;een to imbibe mo&s;t ab&s;urd and fatal errors.</P>
<P>THE light imparted by the Holy Gho&s;t in regeneration, does not imply the di&s;covery of any truth which is not contained in the Bible; but it is de&s;igned to give to the heart a reli&s;h for the doctrines, laws, and promi|&s;es, which are contained in that holy book. If in the new birth &s;ome truth were commu|nicated
<PB N="22" REF="036872_0021_100B2703E80ED648">which is not to be found in the writ|ten word, we &s;hould be left without any &s;tanding rule for the trial of the &s;pirits. The change wrought in regeneration, brings the heart into harmony with the plan of &s;alva|tion which is revealed in the &s;acred volume. The book of God appears in a new light to tho&s;e who are born again; not becau&s;e any new truth is revealed, but becau&s;e their hearts have a new reli&s;h, and in con&s;equence of this they di&s;cover new beauties in the law and go&s;pel. Now they receive the divine word, not as the word of men, but as THE WORD OF GOD.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. REGENERATION is an in&s;tantane|ous change. This is an obvious conclu&s;ion from its con&s;i&s;ting in a new heart, or a holy temper, in oppo&s;ition to the old man, or to a mind at enmity with God. Among the unregenerate &s;ome are openly vicious, and others maintain external purity in their con|duct; &s;ome are &s;unk in &s;tupidity, and oth|ers are filled with fearful apprehen&s;ions of the wrath to come; but whatever variety is to be found among them, they all agree in being alienated from the life of God. There is no e&s;&s;ential alteration of character in any one of the human race, except he be born again. Between &s;in and holine&s;s there can be no medium; &s;ince they are directly op|po&s;ed
<PB N="23" REF="036872_0022_100B2707CADAFDE0">to each other. There is no per&s;on on the earth who is not either the friend, or the enemy of God. The words of Chri&s;t, in Matth. xii. 30, place this beyond doubt, <HI>He that is not with me is again&s;t me; and he that gathereth not with me &s;cattereth abroad.</HI> Between the intere&s;ts of Chri&s;t's kingdom and tho&s;e of Satan's, there is no commun|ion. Every per&s;on in this a&s;&s;embly, or any where on the earth, is either in the road to heaven, or in the road to hell; and were he this moment to enter the world of &s;pirits, he would either be received into paradi&s;e, or be doomed to endle&s;s mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>THERE can be no point of time in which one is neither in a renewed, nor an unre|newed &s;tate; and therefore when the new heart is given, it mu&s;t be given in an in&s;tant. The work of <HI>&s;anctification</HI> is carried on pro|gre&s;&s;ively in the hearts of the renewed, and will be continued until it is completed in the concluding moment of life; but regen|eration is the <HI>beginning</HI> of holine&s;s in the &s;oul, and admits of no progre&s;&s;ion. The point of time in which it is effected, is as indivi&s;i|ble as was that between the Almighty Fiat in the morning of the creation and the work done&mdash;<HI>GOD &s;aid let there be light, and there was light.</HI></P>

CHRISTIANITY is not an&s;werable for the abu&s;es which have been made of the doctrine before us. There is nothing in it which countenances enthu&s;ia&s;tic impul&s;es, or a life of &s;loth and wickedne&s;s. In regeneration men are made willing to enter into the rea|&s;onable &s;ervice which God requireth in his word, are placed under the dominion of the pure and benevolent &s;pirit of the go&s;pel, and enter on a life of great vigilance and activity.</P>
<P>IF it be not allowed that regeneration is an in&s;tantaneous change, &s;ome other nature mu&s;t be attributed to it, than that which has now been de&s;cribed. If the change be grad|ual; the old man and the new are not very wide apart; or there mu&s;t be a middle char|acter produced which no one can de&s;cribe, and which has no &s;tate a&s;&s;igned to it in the retributions of eternity. If all men, as &s;oon as they are brought into exi&s;tence, po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;eeds of virtue as an e&s;&s;ential attribute of their nature, or have them implanted in their hearts by the Holy Gho&s;t, it will fol|low that no <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> change is nece&s;&s;ary to fit any one of Adam's race for heaven. On this plan the lo&s;t have the &s;ame general char|acter with the &s;aved; and the difference between them is to be a&s;certained by a cer|tain <HI>degree</HI> of goodne&s;s to which the &s;aved ri&s;e, and which the lo&s;t either do not acquire,
<PB N="25" REF="036872_0024_100B270C9C53C520">or do not retain. What is this degree of goodne&s;s which con&s;titutes regeneration? To find it we mu&s;t draw a line &s;omewhere between &s;inle&s;s perfection and a &s;tate of un|regeneracy. What clue have we to guide us? The regenerate mu&s;t be thrown into a labyrinth of perplexity, and be left without means to extricate them&s;elves, if they are to have recour&s;e to nothing for evidence in favor of their heir&s;hip to glory, but a cer|tain degree of holine&s;s no where de&s;cribed in the word of God. The &s;acred writings abound with de&s;criptions of the fle&s;h and the &s;pirit, their oppo&s;ite natures and fruits; but they do not afford us any light in de|termining to what grade actions mu&s;t ri&s;e or fall, to con&s;titute a holy, or a &s;inful, char|acter. We cannot account for the &s;train in which the &s;criptures proceed, if holine&s;s and &s;in be not of contrary natures, and if there be not an e&s;&s;ential difference between the characters of the righteous and the wicked.</P>
<P>THE more attentively we examine the doctrine of progre&s;&s;ive regeneration, the more fully it will appear that it is built on principles which deny the full extent of man's depravity, the nece&s;&s;ity of an e&s;&s;ential change of character; and which renders the work that pa&s;&s;es on the renewed, little, if any
<PB N="26" REF="036872_0025_100B2711712E9380">thing, more than a renunciation of the forms of fal&s;e wor&s;hip, and a profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity, accompanied with a life ex|ternally pure. Can this be the e&s;&s;ence of that change which Mo&s;es and the prophets, Chri&s;t and the apo&s;tles, make nece&s;&s;ary to pre|pare men for the enjoyment of a holy God?</P>
<P>ETERNAL life is promi&s;ed to the &s;malle&s;t expre&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tian love, even the giv|ing of a cup of cold water to one in the name of a di&s;ciple. How can we account for the glorious reward which &s;o &s;mall an action meets, if it were not grounded on a principle wholly different from that which gives birth to the &s;hining actions of many impenitent &s;inners? The true di&s;ciples of Je|&s;us Chri&s;t are renewed in the &s;pirit of their minds, and are prepared to bring forth good fruit. Hence, in the &s;malle&s;t holy actions they perform, they may collect evidence that they are members of Chri&s;t's my&s;tical body, and that they will be owned by him when he &s;hall come to be glorified in his &s;aints, and to be admired in all them that believe.</P>
<P>THE thoughts which have been &s;ugge&s;ted on the &s;ubject to which we have been attend|ing lead us to remark,</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT the doctrine of regeneration is a plain and con&s;i&s;tent doctrine. It is reveal|ed both in the Old Te&s;tament and in the
<PB N="27" REF="036872_0026_100B2712F4E1F6C0">New, and is an e&s;&s;ential part of the plan of &s;alvation which is proclaimed in the go&s;pel. The doctrine involves no ab&s;urdity, or con|tradiction. It re&s;pects nothing in man but his character. It is this which is changed by the influences of the Holy Gho&s;t. This change does not impair man's intelligent na|ture, nor offer the lea&s;t violence to the free|dom of his will; but inclines him to love and &s;erve God in the pre&s;ent world, and pre|pares him for the enjoyment of God in the world to come. If any will contend that re|generation is to be numbered among the dreams of a &s;uper&s;titious or a gloomy mind, they betary great ignorance both of God and them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="2">2. WE may infer that the doctrine of re|generation does not relax the moral obliga|tions of &s;inners, nor dimini&s;h the propriety of calling on them to repent and turn unto the Lord.</P>
<P>As has been ob&s;erved, man does not by his &s;in drop his intelligent nature, nor cea&s;e to be bound by the divine law, nor to be accountable to the &s;upreme King. Be the di&s;po&s;ition of man's heart what it may, the homage which God requireth of him re|maineth a rea&s;onable &s;ervice. The &s;ubjects of the divine moral government are as un|able to de&s;troy their obligations to obedi|ence,
<PB N="28" REF="036872_0027_100B27159D8D27B0">as they are to annihilate them&s;elves, or to dethrone the Almighty. If nothing more were required of &s;inners than they are inclined to do, their rebellion would cea&s;e to be a &s;in, the moral law would lo&s;e its authority, and the &s;alvation of &s;inners, if it could be called &s;alvation, would not be of grace, but of debt.</P>
<P>THAT &s;inners are called upon to repent and turn unto the Lord throughout the &s;criptures, can be denied by none who have attended to the&s;e writings. Though the calls of God's word and providence prove ineffectual, as we daily &s;ee, the pro|priety and rea&s;onablene&s;s of the divine com|mands cannot be que&s;tioned. Impenitent &s;inners are addre&s;&s;ed as rational creatures, as voluntary agents, and as having an ap|petite for happine&s;s and an aver&s;ion to mi&s;|ery. They may have a doctrinal belief of what the Lord requireth them to renounce, and what to embrace; and may feel a deep impre&s;&s;ion of truth on their con&s;ciences, while they refu&s;e to come unto Chri&s;t that they may have life. It is declared by the Saviour in the 20th ver&s;e of the chapter which contains the text. <HI>That every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, le&s;t his deeds &s;hould be reproved.</HI> Are the wicked not to be exhorted to come to
<PB N="29" REF="036872_0028_100B2718B6B474A0">the light, becau&s;e they hate it? Are the terms of &s;alvation to be brought down to a level with the exerci&s;es of their rebellious hearts? The impenitent are not thus excu|&s;ed, nor is &s;uch daring pre&s;umption encour|aged, in the word of God. Let us attend to a few pa&s;&s;ages out of the many which might be quoted. Jere. iv. 14. <HI>O Jeru&s;a|lem, wa&s;h thine heart from wickedne&s;s, that thou maye&s;t be &s;aved: how long &s;hall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?</HI> Mark i. 14, 15. <HI>Now, after that John was put in pri&s;on, Je&s;us came into Galilee, preaching the go&s;pel of the kingdom of God, and &s;aying, The time is ful|filled, and the kingdom of God is at band: re|pent ye, and believe the go&s;pel.</HI> Acts xvii. 30. &mdash;<HI>God now commandeth all men every where to repent.</HI> James iv. 8, 9, 10. <HI>Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Clean&s;e your hands, ye &s;inners; and purify your hearts ye double-minded. Be afflicted and mourn, and weep; let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heavine&s;s. Humble your&s;elves in the &s;ight of the Lord, and he &s;hall lift you up.</HI> The&s;e few texts are a &s;pecimen of the divine requirements from &s;inners, and to what temper the promi&s;es are made. By the cur|rent language of the lively oracles we mu&s;t be convinced, if we attend with candor, that exerci&s;es of heart are required of &s;in|ners
<PB N="30" REF="036872_0029_100B271ADEDBA498">to which they are wholly oppo&s;ed; and that if they will contend in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, they contend with God.</P>
<P>THE &s;ubject now immediately before us, my friends, is a painful one to the unre|conciled heart. If any one doubt whether his heart be at enmity with God, let him attend to its exerci&s;es in him&s;elf when the divine command is in full view. If there be one now in the hearing of this di&s;cour&s;e who is charging God with being a hard ma&s;ter, be intreated to pau&s;e, and reflect on your character and &s;tate with all the &s;o|lemnity, which becometh a dying accounta|ble creature. If the wickedne&s;s of your heart will ju&s;tify you in not turning to God now, it will ju&s;tify your impenitence here|after, and will &s;ecure you from puni&s;hment when you &s;hall be arraigned at the bar of the Judge of the living and the dead. Will you dare &s;tand up before him, and plead the enmity of your heart again&s;t him as an excu&s;e for not being reconciled to his gov|ernment? Tremble at the thought of main|taining a controver&s;y with God! Throw down the weapons of your rebellion, and &s;ubmit your&s;elf to him.</P>
<P>IT is a plea&s;ing &s;ight to the friends of Zion to behold &s;inners rou&s;ed from &s;tupidity, reading the Bible, and anxiou&s;ly inquiring
<PB N="31" REF="036872_0030_100B271C63144D08">what they mu&s;t do to be &s;aved. There is much more rea&s;on to hope that &s;uch per&s;ons will be brought to the knowledge of the truth, than tho&s;e who are &s;ecure in their &s;ins, who prefer any other book to the Book of God, and frequent the hou&s;e of mirth. But when &s;inners are &s;olemnized, and have terrible apprehen&s;ions of the wrath to come, no one ought to attempt to give them relief by a&s;&s;uring them that certain exerci&s;es of the impenitent heart &s;ecure to them a prom|i&s;e of being fitted for heaven. It is danger|ous to give &s;uch coun&s;el; becau&s;e it is not warranted by the word of God, and becau&s;e it will, if believed, throw the awakened &s;in|ner into a &s;tate of carnal &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>O YE &s;inners, of every de&s;cription, let not a deceived heart any longer turn you a&s;ide. Do not flatter your&s;elves with the hope of finding peace while you remain God's enemies. You mu&s;t become recon|ciled to him or you mu&s;t peri&s;h forever. If you give up your&s;elves to him, you will, on the one hand, cheerfully acknowledge your obligations to holine&s;s; and on the other, that &s;overeign grace was di&s;played in bringing you into captivity to the obedience of Chri&s;t. This hath been the language of the redeem|ed of our race from the beginning to this day. May all our hearts accord with the
<PB N="32" REF="036872_0031_100B271ECC93AA60">words of the apo&s;tle, <HI>Work out your own &s;al|vation with fear and trembling: For it is God who worketh in you both to will and to do, of his good plea&s;ure.</HI> AMEN.</P>

<P>THE &s;cripture doctrine of regeneration is a &s;tumbling-block to many, who have been educated under the light of the go&s;pel. They neither under&s;tand the na|ture, nor acknowledge the nece&s;&s;ity, of this change; and they exclaim, with Nicode|mus, "How can the&s;e things be!"

<P><PB N="34" REF="036872_0033_100B27234E8A2718">
HAVING attempted to explain the nature of regeneration in my fir&s;t di&s;cour&s;e, I pro|ceed in this to con&s;ider the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of this change.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. THE moral depravity of man fur|ni&s;hes proof, that no individual of the hu|man race can enter into the kingdom of heaven, except he be born again. In what this depravity con&s;i&s;ts, or how it affects the mind, has been already &s;hown. Let us at|tend for a moment, to the evidence that our moral nature is depraved.</P>
<P>THAT all mankind are inclined to &s;in is plain from the hi&s;tory of our race, from the date of Adam's tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion to the pre&s;ent time. Experience has abundantly taught that all men, when left to the guid|ance of their own hearts, have uniformly and invariably tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the divine law, and have not cho&s;en to retain God in their knowledge. The in&s;tances of piety to be found in &s;ome individuals form no objection to the pre&s;ent argument; becau&s;e all the&s;e pious per&s;ons are monuments of divine grace. They who have not been guilty of &s;in need no pardon. But no one of the human race has been &s;aved on any other ground than that of the atonement which hath been made by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. He is the Saviour of mankind, <HI>neither is there &s;alva|tion
<PB N="35" REF="036872_0034_100B2725D6F7E5E8">in any other; for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we mu&s;t be &s;aved.</HI> He did not come to call the righteous, but &s;inners to repentance. His plan of &s;alvation nece&s;&s;arily implies that all mankind have apo&s;tatized, and are ju&s;tly expo&s;ed to everla&s;ting wrath. Tho&s;e who are &s;aved by him are the mo&s;t ready to ac|knowledge their native propen&s;ity to &s;in. The apo&s;tle Paul, in Rom. vii. &s;peaketh the language of them all, <HI>I know that in me (that is, in my fle&s;h) dwelleth no good thing.</HI> Real Chri&s;tians are mo&s;t full in confe&s;&s;ing that they &s;ee depravity every where among man|kind, and that they daily feel it in them|&s;elves. If the good opinion which &s;ome profe&s;s to entertain of the human character be ju&s;t, it is very &s;trange that tho&s;e per&s;ons who are the pure&s;t in their walk, &s;hould be the mo&s;t ready to confe&s;s the wickedne&s;s of the heart.</P>
<P>IF we &s;urvey the conduct of mankind from the time of Adam to that of Noah, from Noah to Abraham, from Abraham to Mo&s;es, from Mo&s;es to David, from David to the coming of Chri&s;t, and from the com|ing of Chri&s;t to the pre&s;ent day, we find facts without number to e&s;tabli&s;h the doc|trine of moral depravity. What impiety, idolatry, profanene&s;s, inju&s;tice, rapine, vi|olence,
<PB N="36" REF="036872_0035_100B27285118A5E0">uncleanne&s;s, envy, malice, and other &s;ins, have prevailed on the earth? How large a proportion of our hi&s;tory is written in characters of blood?</P>
<P>WE cannot account for the wickedne&s;s which has been prevalent among mankind from bad example. An attempt to account for it in this way, is only to remove the difficulty a &s;tep further back. The que&s;tion immediately ari&s;es, "How became bad ex|amples &s;o common?" Why do we find them not only among the Heathen nations, but among the de&s;cendants of the pious patri|archs? If there be no corrupt propen&s;ity in the heart of man, why are not good exam|ples as common as bad ones? We cannot avoid judging a tree by its fruit: And hence, if the fruit be corrupt, the tree mu&s;t be corrupt.</P>
<P>THAT the heart of man is wholly corrupt is explicitly and fully declared throughout the in&s;pired writings. Gen. vi. 5. <HI>And God &s;aw that the wickedne&s;s of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.</HI> The force of the argument in &s;upport of human depravity drawn from this text can|not be evaded, by con&s;ining this de&s;cription to the antediluvians; for it is declared by Jehovah, after the flood, in Gen. viii. 21.
<PB N="37" REF="036872_0036_100B272B7133D340"><HI>I will not again cur&s;e the ground any more for man's &s;ake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth.</HI> The character here given of man, is as applicable to the inhabit|ants of the new world, as to the inhabitants of the old. It is particularly applied to the former, and con&s;idered as common to men of all ages and nations, from the early pe|riod of life. If we &s;hould grant that the inhabitants of the earth do not proceed to the &s;ame enormity of wickedne&s;s in the days &s;ub&s;equent to the deluge as in tho&s;e which preceded it, &s;till the &s;ame general character is a&s;cribed to man&mdash;<HI>his heart is evil from his youth.</HI></P>

He mu&s;t be under&s;tood to apply the words in the la&s;t &s;en&s;e: For he introduces the pa&s;&s;age
<PB N="40" REF="036872_0039_100B273197227088">with declaring that <HI>he had before proved both Jews and Gentiles that they are all under &s;in.</HI> Jews and Gentiles include all mankind. After the apo&s;tle had mentioned that both Jews and Gentiles are all under &s;in, he pro|ceeds to confirm this point by uttering him|&s;elf in the words of the Jewi&s;h &s;criptures "As it is written, There is none righteous, no not one"&mdash;and continues to &s;ketch the fea|tures of the human heart through the whole pa&s;&s;age. Further to &s;how that the charac|ter of the whole human race falls within the apo&s;tle's de&s;ign, it may be ob&s;erved that he draws &s;uch conclu&s;ions from the premi&s;es contained in the words quoted as demon|&s;trate that the depravity de&s;cribed in them extends to all mankind; ver&s;es 19, 20. <HI>Now, we know, that what things &s;oever the law &s;aith, it &s;aith to them who are under the law; that every mouth may be &s;topped, and all the world may become guilty before God.

If the apo&s;tle did not de&s;ign to extend the deprav|ity he had de&s;cribed to all mankind, how would he conclude from it, as he doth, that <HI>no fle&s;h</HI>&mdash;no individual of the human race,
<PB N="41" REF="036872_0040_100B273562495030">can be ju&s;tified by the deeds of the law. If there were &s;ome individuals of Adam's po&s;|terity, or even one, without &s;in, there would be an exception from the common way of ju&s;tification in the &s;ight of God through the atonement&mdash;that &s;mall number of holy per|&s;ons who never &s;inned, or that individual who is &s;potle&s;s, can be ju&s;tified by the deeds of the law. But the apo&s;tle makes no ex|ception. He &s;aith by the deeds of the law &s;hall <HI>no fle&s;h,</HI> be ju&s;tified in his &s;ight. He denies that any exception is to be admitted. He further goes on to declare in the 23d ver&s;e, <HI>For all have &s;inned and come &s;hort of the glory of God.</HI> He does not &s;ay that a few have &s;inned, or that a &s;trong corrupt party in I&s;rael in the times of the kings and proph|ets, or in any nation or age, have &s;inned, but that <HI>All have &s;inned.</HI> He repre&s;ents <HI>all mankind</HI> as being de&s;titute of the fear of God, and in the way to ruin. He adds in the 28th, 29th, and 30th. ver&s;es, <HI>Therefore we conclude, that a man is ju&s;tified by faith without the deeds of the law. Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not al&s;o of the Gentiles?

<P>IT being manife&s;t that the pa&s;&s;age de&s;crip|tive of man's depravity in Rom. iii. is to be
<PB N="42" REF="036872_0041_100B2736E4C548C8">applied to every individual of the human race, it will follow that all mankind are, by nature, <HI>totally</HI> depraved, or that their hearts are wholly corrupt.

<P>IT is not implied in the doctrine of total depravity, that all &s;inners have an equal degree of guilt, or that they all commit crimes in the face of the world, or that they are as bad as they can be; but by to|tal depravity is meant a heart which is whol|ly de&s;titute of holine&s;s, and wholly in love with &s;in.

Be&s;ides, as has been &s;hown, moral depravity re&s;pects noth|ing but the heart, or the temper of the mind; and therefore whether it be partial or total, none of the powers of moral a|gency are de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>Do we not find that the wor&s;t of men are as voluntary in their actions as the be&s;t? The mo&s;t vile are much more active in build|ing up the kingdom of darkne&s;s, than Chri&s;|tians are in promoting the kingdom of the Redeerner. <HI>The children of this world are in their generation wi&s;er than the children of light.</HI> No one will deny that Satan is totally de|praved,

<P>FROM the character of man by nature, we may determine that no one can &s;ee the kingdom of God, if he be not turned from &s;in to holine&s;s, or be born again. The truth of this will more fully appear by con|&s;idering,</P>

THE di&s;cour&s;e will be concluded with a few reflexions.</P>
<P N="1">1. REGENERATION is a great change. The proud and rebellious heart is brought into obedience to the divine government, and God is cho&s;en as the portion of the &s;oul. The &s;ubjects of the new birth are called out of darkne&s;s into God's marvellous light. <HI>If any man be in Chri&s;t he is a new creature: old things are pa&s;&s;ed away; behold, all things are become new.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. v. 17.</NOTE> The regenerate are made <HI>partakers of the divine nature,</HI> the moral im|age of God lo&s;t by the apo&s;tacy is re&s;tored to their hearts, and they are brought into his holy kingdom. <HI>God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved them, even when they were dead in &s;ins, hath quickened them together with Chri&s;t, and hath rai&s;ed them up together, and made them to &s;it together in heavenly places in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eph. ii. 4, 5, 6.</NOTE> Heaven is begun in their &s;ouls, they have a ta&s;te for the things which God hath prepared for them that love him; and he who hath be|gun a good work in them will perform it until the day when the Saviour will appear in all his glory.</P>
<P>ARE there any pre&s;ent who are born of God, you delight in his holy will, and en|joy communion with him. You do not in|dulge
<PB N="48" REF="036872_0047_100B27434B9AD728">enmity again&s;t him, but love his char|acter, and cheerfully &s;ubmit to his domin|ion. You are convinced that wi&s;dom's ways are ways of plea&s;antne&s;s, and that all her paths are peace. What a new face has been put on the word and works of God in the view of your minds? When God man|ife&s;ts him&s;elf to your &s;ouls, whether you are in the &s;anctuary, in the clo&s;et, or in the mid&s;t of your worldly bu&s;ine&s;s you can &s;ay, "It is good for us to be here." Would you exchange a place in Chri&s;t's family for all the plea&s;ures, the rich|es, and the honors of the world? A man full of malevolence does not ta&s;te the &s;weet|ne&s;s of Chri&s;tian love; a proud man is not charmed with humility; and an unbeliever is blind to the glory of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Do you not admire the pure, the di&s;intere&s;ted nature of the divine benevolence? Can you expre&s;s in words how glorious the Saviour appears? Do you not delight in contempla|ting the character and work of Him, who&s;e name is called <HI>Wonderful, Coun&s;ellor, The mighty God, the everla&s;ting Father, The Prince of peace?</HI> Do not his worth, his beauty and his glory &s;ometimes appear &s;o plain, &s;o ex|cellent and ravi&s;hing, as to impre&s;s your minds, for a moment, with a belief that you can convince the impenitent of their &s;in and folly, and compel them to come to
<PB N="49" REF="036872_0048_100B27472E269728">the go&s;pel fea&s;t? Perhaps you have made the attempt in this &s;ea&s;on of warmth, and have been taught by the experiment how unable you are to open the eyes of the blind. This hath &s;erved to give you the deeper con|viction of your dependence on &s;overeign grace, and of the importance of keeping your place at the foot-&s;tool of Him who a|lone can &s;ubdue the hearts of the di&s;obedi|ent. Are you not abundantly convinced that your former ob&s;tinacy would have re|mained, if God, who is rich in mercy had not made you willing in the day of his pow|er? He hath cau&s;ed you to flee from the wrath to come, and hath made you heirs of the heavenly inheritance. The Lord hath done great things for you: Be thankful un|to him, and ble&s;s his holy name.</P>
<P>IT has been inquired, why, if regenera|tion be &s;o great a change, it is no more ap|parent in the &s;ubjects of it, to mankind in general? To this it may be replied, That the unholy are &s;trangers to the exerci&s;es of the renewed heart, and do not enter into the motives by which it is governed. The life of Chri&s;tians is hidden with Chri&s;t in God; Hence the world knoweth them not. Men who are ignorant of the power of godline&s;s, are hable to form very erroneous opinions with re&s;pect to the manner in which real pi|ety
<PB N="50" REF="036872_0049_100B274A6E9381F8">is to be expre&s;&s;ed. Some &s;eem to &s;up|po&s;e that if any profe&s;s a religion which is not as much edified by gay amu&s;ements, or the pur&s;uits of wealth and ambition, as by an attendance on the wor&s;hip of God, they mu&s;t, to act con&s;i&s;tently, abandon temporal concerns, and retire from &s;ociety. Chri&s;|tians have, in times of per&s;ecution, been compelled to wander in de&s;erts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth. But they are forbidden to withdraw from &s;ociety in ordinary &s;ea&s;ons. Should they do this, they would put them&s;elves out of the way of letting their light &s;hine be|fore men. Their hearts are not placed on earthly enjoyments as a portion; and they con&s;ent to &s;acrifice them all, and even life it&s;elf, when they cannot retain them without denying Chri&s;t. Diligence in the manage|ment of temporal concerns is enjoined on Chri&s;tians by the divine law. In attending to the&s;e, they have occa&s;ion to mingle with the enemies of their Lord. They do not choo&s;e &s;uch for their intimate friends; but in their occa&s;ional intercour&s;e with the wick|ed, they may keep their garments undefiled, as Lot did in Sodom, and as Daniel did in the court of Per&s;ia. Strangers to religion may think that &s;ince Chri&s;tians &s;ow and reap, buy and &s;ell, and tran&s;act other worldly bu|&s;ine&s;s, in common with the re&s;t of man|kind,
<PB N="51" REF="036872_0050_100B274C3655F920">they are in reality the &s;ame. Hence their true character is overlooked, and their profe&s;&s;ion is charged with hypocri&s;y.</P>
<P>AGAIN, tho&s;e who are born of God &s;oon lo&s;e that warmth by which they are at fir&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed. The carele&s;s and the pro|phane who ob&s;erve this abatement, &s;uppo&s;e that the &s;ubjects of it either counterfeited all their former zeal, or were carried away by an idle dream. Chri&s;tians are liable to wan|der from God, but the decline of their fir&s;t fervor is no certain evidence of their back|&s;liding from truth or duty. New converts are &s;oon led to &s;ee that they have overrated their attainments, and go into the conflicts of the Chri&s;tian warfare; in which they become better acquainted with the divine character and their own, are more alive un|to God, and are better fitted to &s;erve him in the pre&s;ent world, and to enjoy him in the world to come. While <HI>their love is abounding yet more and more in knowledge, and in all judg|ment,</HI> they may be thought by the ungodly to have become lukewarm towards the cau&s;e of the Redeemer.</P>
<P>IT is further to be con&s;idered that Chri&s;|tians are now in an imperfect &s;tate. They are &s;anctified but in part, and have much remaining &s;in. By lap&s;es in their external behaviour they give occa&s;ion to the wicked
<PB N="52" REF="036872_0051_100B274F71D5C448">to <HI>bla&s;pheme that worthy name by the which they are called.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER all, it cannot be denied that tho&s;e Chri&s;tians who are much improved in holi|ne&s;s, exhibit in their practice &s;uch a fixed purpo&s;e of cleaving unto the Lord, as leads the ungodly to take knowledge of them as having been with Je&s;us. Hardened unbe|lievers look on the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t with an evil eye. They watch for their halting. They are glad to &s;ee them &s;tumble. They clo&s;ely in&s;pect their behaviour, and when they di&s;cover a fault they magnify it, and pa&s;s &s;entence in the &s;evere&s;t manner. They &s;crutinize and they condemn with this &s;e|verity, to keep their own con&s;ciences quiet while they are &s;erving divers lu&s;ts and plea&s;|ures. Deluded mortals! will the &s;ins of God's people &s;creen you from guilt? and furni&s;h a plea for your acquittal when you &s;hall be arraigned at the bar of the Judge of all the earth? <HI>If the righteous &s;carcely be &s;aved, where &s;hall the ungodly and the &s;inner appear?</HI> To return, bitter and cruel as may be the enemies of the Cro&s;s, they are &s;ome|times compelled to acknowledge, that Chri&s;|tians manife&s;t a &s;pirit of benevolence and &s;elf|denial which cannot be found in any other men. Scoffers have their &s;ea&s;ons of relen|ting, and the monitor in their brea&s;t pays
<PB N="53" REF="036872_0052_100B275206E5B388">homage to the &s;ervants of the Mo&s;t High God, and confe&s;&s;es them to be the excel|lent of the earth.

<P N="2">2. THE &s;overeign mercy of God is di&s;|played in regeneration.

<P>THEY who are born of God often call to mind their former character and &s;tate. They will not forget the&s;e in any pe|riod of their exi&s;tence. The apo&s;tle Paul, after his conver&s;ion, looked back with deep &s;orrow on his temper and conduct when he was an enemy to Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and had a lively &s;en&s;e of the riches of divine grace which had renewed his heart, and brought him into favor with God. All true Chri&s;|tians imitate him in &s;uch reflections. The
<PB N="60" REF="036872_0058_100B2760AF3DEAF8">apo&s;tle includes him&s;elf with tho&s;e to whom he wrote, when he &s;aith in the context and in the text, <HI>For we our&s;elves al&s;o were &s;ome|times fooli&s;h, di&s;obedient, deceived, &s;erving di|vers lu&s;ts and plea&s;ures, living in malice and en|vy, hateful, and hating one another. But after that the kindne&s;s and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared, not by works of right|eou&s;ne&s;s which we have done, but according to his mercy he &s;aved us, by the wa&s;hing of re|generation, and renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t; which he &s;hed on us abundantly through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Saviour; that being ju&s;tified by his grace, we &s;hould be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN any of the children of men are turned unto God they cannot attribute the change in them&s;elves to any works of their own; but they are wholly indebted to his mercy for tho&s;e influences which inclined them to believe to the &s;aving of their &s;ouls. They had performed no holy action before they were wrought upon from on high. There was nothing in their hearts which moved God to &s;how favor to them in di&s;|tinction from others. Their alienation from Him would have remained, if he had not <HI>according to his mercy &s;aved them by the wa&s;h|ing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI></P>

My de&s;ign in di&s;cour&s;ing from the text is, to con&s;ider the Agency of the Holy Gho&s;t in regeneration.</P>
<P>THE Holy Gho&s;t is one of the per&s;ons of the Trinity. He is joined with the Father and the Son in the in&s;tituted form of Chri&s;|tian bapti&s;m, and in the apo&s;tolic &s;alutations to the churches; and is called GOD. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts V. 4.</NOTE> The men who were employed in penning the &s;criptures were in&s;pired by him. <HI>The proph|ecy came not in old time by the will of man; but holy men of God &s;pake as they were moved by the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. i. 21.</NOTE> The Holy Gho&s;t de|&s;cended in a bodily &s;hape, like a dove, up|on Chri&s;t, immediately after his bapti&s;m, and a voice came from Heaven, which &s;aid, <HI>Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well plea&s;ed.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matth. iii. 16, 17, Luke iii. 21, 22.</NOTE> By this de&s;cent of the Holy Gho&s;t upon the Son of God he was publicly con|&s;ecrated as the Prophet, Prie&s;t, and King, of the Church. In allu&s;ion to this he is called the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> or the <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> each of which titles &s;ignifies <HI>The Anointed.</HI> The Holy Gho&s;t is &s;tiled the <HI>Comforter,</HI> in the xiv, xv. and xvi. chapters of John the E|vangeli&s;t. In the primitive ages of the church the Holy Gho&s;t conferred a power of &s;peaking with tongues before unknown to the &s;peaker, a knowledge of future
<PB N="62" REF="036872_0060_100B27656AD8CFA0">events, and other miraculous gifts. The&s;e have, long &s;ince, cea&s;ed in the church; and while they were continued, they were whol|ly di&s;tinct from the renewing or &s;anctifying influences of the Holy Gho&s;t. Miraculous gifts were &s;ometimes imparted to wicked men; and when they were be&s;towed on good men, as they mo&s;t generally were, they were of a different nature from tho&s;e influences of the &s;pirit which renewed their hearts. If the Holy Gho&s;t &s;hould this mo|ment enable one of this congregation to &s;peak in the language of China, or acquaint him with an event pa&s;&s;ing in one of its cities, neither this ability, nor this knowledge, would prove the per&s;on to whom it is com|municated to be a &s;ubject of &s;anctifying grace. The knowledge of a fact, and the renovation of the heart, are things of a different nature. Hence we could not de|termine in favor of a man's piety, if he knew by an immediate revelation from God what will happen in a future period. Mi|raculous gifts were of high importance &s;o long as the canon of &s;cripture remained un|fini&s;hed. They were not continued beyond the infancy of the church; and we have no rea&s;on to expect their return. But &s;hould they, contrary to the general expectation, be re&s;tored, they would not &s;tand in the place of tho&s;e influences of the &s;pirit which change
<PB N="63" REF="036872_0061_100B2766EFC18E30">men's hearts and fit them for Heaven. When the &s;eventy returned to Chri&s;t after they had been &s;ent out by him to preach the go&s;pel and to confirm their mi&s;&s;ion by mir|acles, they &s;aid unto him <HI>Lord, even the devils are &s;ubject unto us through thy name.</HI> He replied, <HI>I beheld Satan as lightning fall from Heaven. Behold, I give unto you power to tread on &s;erpents and &s;corpions, and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing &s;hall by any means hurt you. Notwith&s;tanding, in this rejoice not that the &s;pirits are &s;ubject unto you; but rather rejoice, becau&s;e your names are writ|ten in Heaven.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke x. 17&mdash;20.</NOTE> The apo&s;tle Paul declares, in 1 Cor. xiii. <HI>Though I &s;peak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as &s;ounding bra&s;s, or a tinkling cym|bal. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and under&s;tand all my&s;teries, and all knowl|edge; and though I have all faith, &s;o that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.</HI></P>
<P>THE renewing influences of the Holy Gho&s;t are common to all ages of the church; and were they wholly withdrawn, the work of regeneration would no more appear a|mong mankind, and Satan would reign in every heart.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="036872_0062_100B2768904C0EE0">
THE phra&s;e, <HI>renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> in the text, mu&s;t refer to his influences on the hearts of the &s;aved, and to nothing el&s;e. To the&s;e influences the apo&s;tle attrib|utes the &s;tate of &s;alvation into which he and other believers were brought. If an e&s;&s;en|tial change of heart was nece&s;&s;ary to pre|pare men for heaven heretofore, it is nece&s;|&s;ary now; for the human character is the &s;ame. As man is totally depraved he will not return to God, unle&s;s he be influenced from on high, or by the Holy Gho&s;t. We have the &s;ame evidence that a man mu&s;t be <HI>born of the Spirit,</HI> as that he mu&s;t be born again, to &s;ee the kingdom of God. If we con&s;ider the texts which &s;peak of the influ|ences of the Spirit of God, as confined to his miraculous operations, or to his agency during the fir&s;t ages of the church, we &s;hall do violence to the in&s;pired writings; and re|duce the kingdom of grace to a level with the kingdom of nature.</P>
<P>THAT the Holy Gho&s;t hath a &s;pecial a|gency in regeneration may be proved,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. FROM the ways in which he operateth on the minds of the &s;aved.</P>
<P>IT is not denied that &s;ome are &s;anctified from the womb. In in&s;tances of this kind we are compelled to acknowledge the imme|diate
<PB N="65" REF="036872_0063_100B276CEDB7FAC0">agency of the Holy Gho&s;t; becau&s;e external means had not been enjoyed. Per|&s;ons of this de&s;cription who have lived long enough to be able to communicate by words their internal exerci&s;es, have been full in ac|knowledging the doctrine of depravity, and the ab&s;olute need of the influences of the Spirit of God to renew the heart. We hear the &s;ame confe&s;&s;ion from the mouths of per&s;ons appar|ently renewed in adult years, who cannot, as is mo&s;t u&s;ual, give a particular account of the time of their conver&s;ion. It is in|deed of much higher importance to be able to trace in our&s;elves the nature of true reli|gion, than the period of its commence|ment, or the order of our exerci&s;es. We are to guard in this place again&s;t counte|nancing the idea, that the tran&s;ition from an unregenerate to a renewed &s;tate, is like the growth of a plant from a &s;maller to a larger &s;ize. This opinion tends, like an opiate, to quiet the minds of the &s;ecure, and to leave them undi&s;turbed whil&s;t they put the form of godline&s;s in the place of its power. It cannot be too deeply impre&s;&s;ed on our minds, that there is an <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> differ|ence between the characters of the regene|rate and the unregenerate. Hence it gen|erally happens that Chri&s;tians are able to give an orderly account of alarming appre|hen&s;ions
<PB N="66" REF="036872_0064_100B276F9E05F578">of the wrath to come, and of clear and &s;triking di&s;coveries of the wickedne&s;s of the heart, which preceded their &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion to the divine will, when they beheld, with plea&s;ing wonder, the glory of God in the face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>THE &s;criptures do not inform us what de|gree of doctrinal light, how long a &s;ea&s;on of &s;erious thoughtfulne&s;s, or what degree of terror, will exi&s;t in the minds of the re|generate previou&s;ly to their renovation. The&s;e are different in different per&s;ons. The interval between the fir&s;t alarm and conver&s;ion, appears to have been &s;hort, in mo&s;t, if not in all, of tho&s;e who were re|newed under the mini&s;try of Chri&s;t, and that of his apo&s;tles. The knowledge and conviction which are obtained and impre&s;&s;|ed during what has been called the <HI>prepara|tory work,</HI> are of no &s;mall u&s;e; in di&s;clo&s;ing to &s;inners their real character, in teaching them that they mu&s;t be wholly indebted to &s;overeign grace for &s;alvation, and in a&s;&s;i&s;t|ing them in their walk when brought into cordial &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the divine will. It has often been remarked that tho&s;e who&s;e minds had been mo&s;t &s;tored with doctrinal knowl|edge, are, other things being equal, the free&s;t from imaginary flights during the ar|dor which young converts feel, and &s;hine
<PB N="67" REF="036872_0065_100B277123BD2798">brighte&s;t in the &s;chool of Chri&s;t. But, to whatever attainments the unregenerate may ri&s;e, whatever anxiety they may endure, or whatever exertions they may make, nothing which goes before the new birth can be con|&s;idered as a <HI>part</HI> of that change. Regene|ration is a work by it&s;elf; and in it a new heart is given&mdash;a heart to which the unre|newed are &s;trangers. The &s;pecial agency of the Holy Gho&s;t in this work, appears from the incidents and means which have been made effectual to the conver&s;ion of &s;inners. A &s;ew of the&s;e will be mentioned in this place.</P>
<P>DEEP conviction has been known to be fa&s;tened on the minds of per&s;ons by their glancing at a few words in the Bible, or &s;ome other good book, without any de&s;ign to &s;eek for the pa&s;&s;age, and far le&s;s to reflect with &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s on any religious &s;ubject. This conviction has been fa&s;tened on their con&s;ciences, and they have not been able to &s;hake it off until God hath made them wil|ling in the day of his power. The like ef|fects have been &s;een to follow the dropping of a word in conver&s;ation, which contained nothing remarkable for pertinence, and was not uttered with any unu&s;ual &s;olemnity. This hath been made effectual; becau&s;e the time had come in which God had determin|ed
<PB N="68" REF="036872_0066_100B277437BBB728">to &s;ave a &s;oul from death, to &s;ave by &s;uch &s;imple means, and to add to the evidence that the excellency of the power is of Him. This &s;ubject of divine grace had perhaps lived long under an able and faithful preach|er of the go&s;pel, and had heard many weighty and alarming thoughts uttered in religious conver&s;ation, but never till now felt the arrows of the Almighty piercing his &s;oul.</P>
<P>GOD hath laid &s;ome on a bed of &s;ickne&s;s, and hath brought them to the borders of the grave, to give them conviction that there is but a &s;tep between them and eternal mi&s;ery, and hath followed this with the renewing in|fluences of his Spirit. We have &s;een how|ever, not a few who have been deeply a|larmed with their danger when death &s;tared them in the face, and abounded with prom|i&s;es of amendment, who have, on the re&s;|toration of health, turned like the dog to his vomit, and the &s;ow that was wa&s;hed to her wallowing in the mire. No promi&s;es of reformation can be relied on which do not &s;pring from a heart that is purified by faith. We are furni&s;hed with &s;o many facts to e&s;tabli&s;h this remark, that we mu&s;t be highly criminal if we attribute the real refor|mations which &s;ometimes follow dangerous &s;ickne&s;s, to any other cau&s;e but the gra|cious
<PB N="69" REF="036872_0067_100B277768049D18">influences of the holy Spirit operating on the heart.</P>
<P>SOME have derived everla&s;ting benefit from the death of their neighbors, friends, or companions. They have been alarmed, as was the Jailer by the earthquake which at midnight &s;hook the foundations of the pri&s;on, in which Paul and Silas were confined, bur&s;t open its doors, and loo&s;ed the chains of the pri&s;oners. Like the keeper of this pri&s;on, they have been brought to believe on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and their &s;orrow has been turned into joy.</P>
<P>IT has been ob&s;erved that &s;udden and &s;ur|pri&s;ing deaths, have not often been followed with the repentance of tho&s;e &s;inners who have been called to witne&s;s the awful events. When one of their companions has been &s;uddenly arre&s;ted by the king of terrors be|fore their eyes, perhaps in the mid&s;t of their wine and profane mirth, they have been filled with con&s;ternation for the moment, and like Bel&s;hazzar, <HI>the joints of their loins have been loo&s;ed, and their knees have &s;mitten one again&s;t another;</HI> but no &s;ooner has the corp&s;e of their dead friend been laid in the grave, and an opportunity has pre&s;ented for a renewal of their di&s;&s;ipation, than they have committed the &s;ame iniquity with gree|dine&s;s,
<PB N="70" REF="036872_0068_100B2779AFBCA078">and have ha&s;tened to fill up the mea&s;ure of their &s;ins. The&s;e melancholy in&s;tances proclaim that madne&s;s is in the hearts of the &s;ons of men, and that the mo&s;t di&s;tracting terrors will not prevail to divorce them from their lu&s;ts. Symptoms of approaching ruin attend &s;uch hardened &s;inners.</P>
<P>IF remarkable, afflictive di&s;pen&s;ations of providence were always &s;et home on the hearts of men&mdash;if repentance always fol|lowed, we might be more liable than we now are to deny the agency of the holy Spirit in creating the new heart, and to forget that God hath mercy on whom he will have mercy.</P>
<P>PARENTS are under high and peculiar obligations to train up their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. They have &s;trong inducements to be faithful to their offspring; not only from the rever|ence which is due to the &s;upreme Law giver, but from the hope that if they do their duty, as far as may be expected from imperfect creatures, their children will be brought to the knowledge of the truth. They who know the worth of their own &s;ouls cannot be unconcerned for the &s;ouls of others, and e&s;pecially for the &s;ouls of tho&s;e whom they have been in&s;trumental in bringing into the

I give up my infant unto thee, thou Lord of all. Out of the mouth of this babe may prai&s;e be perfected. May Chri&s;t be formed in its heart, that it may be to the prai&s;e of the glory of thy grace. I do not a&s;k for it the riches and hon|ors of the world, but I a&s;k for it &s;piritu|al and eternal ble&s;&s;ings.

The prayers, re&s;olutions and coun&s;els of the ancient worthies have
<PB N="72" REF="036872_0070_100B277D62CF02C0">been imitated, in &s;ome degree, by godly parents in every age of the church. The &s;ucce&s;s of their labors has not been &s;mall. Proverbs xxii. 6. <HI>Train up a child in the way he &s;hould go; and when he is old he will not depart from it.</HI></P>
<P>THE peculiar delicacy and tenderne&s;s of the female mind, give to mothers great in|fluence in forming the manners of their off|&s;pring. To them al&s;o, in mo&s;t in&s;tances, is committed the immediate care of their chil|dren, in that early period of life in which they are mo&s;t &s;u&s;ceptible of impre&s;&s;ions. While the pious mother beholds the &s;miles and pret|ty actions of the babe in her arms, and while &s;he watches the fir&s;t dawnings of rea&s;on, &s;he cannot forget that it was born for eter|nity, nor cea&s;e to pray for its immortal wel|fare. As &s;he looks round on her little ones &s;he can adopt the language of the apo&s;tle, in his addre&s;s to the churches of Galatia, with particular application to her offspring, <HI>My little children, of whom I travail in birth again, until Chri&s;t be formed in you.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Galat. iv. 19.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE coun&s;els, the examples, and the prayers, of pious mothers have been re|markably &s;ucceeded. Samuel was the &s;on of his mother's vows&mdash;&s;he promi&s;ed before his birth to give him unto the Lord all the days
<PB N="73" REF="036872_0071_100B277F27070720">of his life, to be devoted to his &s;ervice as a Nazarite. As &s;oon as he was weaned &s;he car|ried him up to the hou&s;e of Eli in Shiloh, where he was educated according to her vow. He mini&s;tered before the Lord when a child, and by his wi&s;e and pious conduct rejoiced the heart of his mother, as &s;he brought him a little coat from year to year, when &s;he came up with her hu&s;band to offer the yearly &s;ac|rifice. Early the Lord appeared to him in a vi&s;ion, and put his fidelity to the te&s;t in de|claring to Elithe de&s;truction which was about to come upon his family. <HI>Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground. And all I&s;rael, from Dan even to Beer&s;heba, knew that Samuel was e&s;tabli&s;hed to be a prophet of the Lord.</HI> He con|tinued in this office from childhood to old age. He judged I&s;rael all the days of his life with great integrity and firmne&s;s, and holds a high rank among the ancient wit|ne&s;&s;es. Timothy, a godly mini&s;ter, knew the &s;criptures from a child; for which he was indebted to his mother, who&s;eexertions were ble&s;&s;ed for his everla&s;ting good. He was the third in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, in the maternal line, who was numbered among the friends of the Redeemer. Grace is not hereditary; but the prayers of godly ance&s;tors are often an&s;wered in the be&s;towment of &s;piritual ble&s;|&s;ings on their po&s;terity. Paul in writing to

<P>LET parents abound in fervent prayer for their beloved offspring. They will receive a glorious reward if their po&s;terity &s;hould peri&s;h.

<P>THE truths contained in the &s;criptures are the ordinary means which God render|eth effectual to the &s;alvation of men. To
<PB N="76" REF="036872_0074_100B2786CE1CA7D8">open, apply and enforce the doctrines and duties revealed in the &s;acred writings, is the great de&s;ign of a religious education, and of the go&s;pel mini&s;try. When God hath been about to rai&s;e a church to him&s;elf in any place, he hath &s;ent thither one, or more, of his &s;ervants to proclaim the glad tidings of his grace, and hath put his word into the hands of that people. <HI>How &s;hall they be|lieve in him of whom they have not heard? and how &s;hall they hear without a preacher?</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. x. 14.</NOTE> If we long after &s;ouls in the bowels of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, we &s;hall improve every opening in providence to &s;end preachers of the go&s;pel among the Heathen nations, and to bring them to an acquaintance with that holy Book which contains the words of eternal life. The attempts of philo&s;ophers to en|lighten the world have terminated in cover|ing it with greater darkne&s;s. The way of &s;alvation is revealed only in the go&s;pel. To this we are required to take heed, as unto a light that &s;hineth in a dark place. <HI>The &s;crip|tures are able to make us wi&s;e unto &s;alvation through faith which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> Let us attend unto the words of the apo&s;tle in 1 Cor. i. 21. <HI>For after that, in the wi&s;dom of God, the world by wi&s;dom knew not God, it plea&s;ed God by the fooli&s;hne&s;s of preaching to &s;ave them that believe.</HI> The grand &s;ubject of that

The go&s;pel is cordially embraced by all who are &s;aved. Rom. i. 16. <HI>For I am not a&s;ham|ed of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t: for it is the power of God unto &s;alvation to every one that believ|eth; to the Jew fir&s;t, and al&s;o to the Greek.</HI></P>
<P>PLAIN, evangelical preaching, is better adapted to convince and awaken the minds of &s;inners than any other means. But, pi|ous, in&s;tructive, and fervent as the preacher may be, he will labor with his hearers in vain if God do not take hold of their hearts by his &s;pirit. The apo&s;tle Paul was the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful in&s;trument in the propaga|tion of the go&s;pel that has been rai&s;ed up, in any age, or country. He was in&s;tru|mental in gathering many &s;ouls into the Redeemer's kingdom. No one has been more ready than he was, to attribute all the &s;ucce&s;s of his labors to divine influence: 1 Cor. iii. 6, 7. <HI>I have planted, Apollos wa|tered; but God gave the increa&s;e. So then, neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the in|crea&s;e.</HI>
<PB N="78" REF="036872_0076_100B278B54D95B48">The mo&s;t able, godly, and &s;ucce&s;s|ful mini&s;ters in every period of the church, have been the mo&s;t abundant in making the &s;ame declaration with the apo&s;tle. They have watched, and they have prayed, that they might not a&s;cribe to their gifts, to their diligence, or to their zeal, the glory which is due only to God. He will not &s;uffer his highly favored &s;ervants to be exalted above mea&s;ure; and hence, to check the a&s;pirings of pride, and to keep them at the foot-&s;tool, he hath often made them endure &s;ome very humbling &s;troke of his rod.</P>
<P>I HOPE that there are per&s;ons pre&s;ent who have felt a divine energy accompanying a preached go&s;pel. Your hearts in their true deformity have been laid open to you in the light of divine truth. You are convinced that you need not look into the conduct of tho&s;e who are around you to find wicked|ne&s;s; you behold it in your&s;elves <HI>written with a pen of iron, and with the point of a di|amond, and graven upon the table of your heart.</HI> You have been made to feel that the &s;en|tence denounced again&s;t the wicked is point|ed again&s;t <HI>you,</HI> and that Chri&s;t alone can deliver you from the cur&s;e of the law. When Chri&s;t revealed him&s;elf to the wo|man of Samaria at Jacob's well, &s;he went into the city and &s;aid to the inhabitants,

With what commanding yet plea&s;ing maje&s;ty doth the word of God appear, when it becometh <HI>the &s;avour of life unto life?</HI></P>
<P>THERE are &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture in which men are &s;aid to be <HI>begotten with the word of truth,</HI> or <HI>born again, by the word of God.</HI> The meaning of the&s;e cannot be that the heart which is totally depraved can be influenced to love a holy God, merely by holding up before it the light which &s;hineth in his word. If objective light were &s;uffi|cient to produce an e&s;&s;ential change of char|acter, there could be no room for the a|gency of the Holy Gho&s;t in the work of regeneration. The word doth not become the power of God unto &s;alvation, only when it is made effectual by his &s;pirit. The word is improved in the preparatory work, both to awaken and in&s;truct the mind. It is God's u&s;ual way when he bringeth an adult per&s;on into his kingdom, to make u&s;e of the truths revealed in the &s;criptures, to give light to the under&s;tanding, and conviction to the con&s;cience, before he changeth the heart. But we have no authority to affirm that the renovation of the heart is the <HI>effect</HI>
<PB N="80" REF="036872_0078_100B2790772E4C08">of the former light and conviction; becau&s;e many are the &s;ubjects of the&s;e who are never born of God.</P>
<P>MEN are begotten with the word of truth, as it is in view of objects held up in the &s;crip|tures, that holy exerci&s;es take place in their minds. The exerci&s;es of the renewed heart are directed towards the God, the law, the Saviour, and the Heaven revealed in the Bible. The &s;acred volume is full of mo|tives to holine&s;s. The&s;e are felt by the re|generate, and by the&s;e are they governed in their pious walk. They who are born again adopt the language of David, in P&s;alm xix, <HI>The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the &s;oul: the te&s;timony of the Lord is &s;ure, making wi&s;e the &s;imple. The &s;tatutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes: The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever: the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether. More to be de&s;ired are they than gold, yea than much fine gold; &s;weeter al&s;o than honey, and the honey-comb. Moreover</HI> by them <HI>is thy &s;ervant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward.</HI> The word of truth will not appear to any one of our apo&s;tate race in &s;uch light and beauty, nor be received with &s;uch love and delight, if God do not by his &s;pirit fir&s;t breathe on his
<PB N="81" REF="036872_0079_100B2793841D3900">heart. When Paul preached at Philippi, <HI>the Lord opened the heart of Lydia, that &s;he attended unto the things which were &s;poken of the apo&s;tle.</HI> Had &s;he not been thus influen|ced by the Holy Gho&s;t, &s;he would have re|mained In impenitence and unbelief like many others in the city where &s;he re&s;ided. The hearts of all who are &s;aved are fir&s;t opened by the &s;pirit of God, to incline them to receive the truths contained in the writ|ten word.&mdash;I proceed to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="2">2dly. THAT the &s;pecial agency of the Holy Gho&s;t in the new birth, appears from the <HI>peculiar call</HI> which is given to the regen|erate.</P>
<P>THE works of nature and providence ren|der mankind inexcu&s;able in their athei&s;m and wickedne&s;s. <HI>The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament &s;heweth his handy work. The invi&s;ible things of him from the cre|ation of the world are clearly &s;een, being under|&s;tood by the things that are made, even his eter|nal power and Godhead.</HI> Tho&s;e who live un|der the light of divine revelation have a much higher call to love and &s;erve God. To them he hath clearly made known his character and will. Before them are &s;et life and death, in a plain and &s;triking manner, in the word of truth. Whatever impre&s;|&s;ions
<PB N="82" REF="036872_0080_100B279507A1E738">are made on the con&s;ciences of tho&s;e who die in their &s;ins, by the Holy Gho&s;t, he never takes hold of their hearts. There is a call of the &s;pirit of God which is effectu|al in every in&s;tance, and is of a different na|ture from any one which is given to them that peri&s;h. This is a doctrine plainly re|vealed in the &s;criptures. In &s;upport of it a number of pa&s;&s;ages will be produced; to to which let us give our careful and &s;erious attention.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t pa&s;&s;age I &s;hall introduce is re|corded in Rom. viii. 28, 29, 30. <HI>And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are THE CAL|LED according to his purpo&s;e. For whom he did foreknow he al&s;o did prede&s;tinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the fir&s;t-born among many brethren. Moreover, whom he did preae&s;tinate, them he al&s;o CALLED; and whom he CALLED, them he al&s;o ju&s;tified; and whom he ju&s;tified, them he al&s;o glorified.</HI> It is manife&s;t from the words of the apo&s;tle in this place that <HI>the called</HI> are the &s;ame with tho&s;e who <HI>love God,</HI> the &s;ame with tho&s;e who are <HI>ju&s;tified,</HI> and the &s;ame with tho&s;e who will be <HI>glorified:</HI> Their calling mu&s;t therefore be peculiar to them&s;elves. If we do not grant this, we mu&s;t admit that &s;ome unre|generate men love God, are ju&s;tified, and
<PB N="83" REF="036872_0081_100B2798214E3AD8">may, with their pre&s;ent character, be glori|fied; all which &s;uppo&s;itions are fal&s;e and an|ti&s;criptural. 1 Cor. i. 26. <HI>For ye &s;ee your CALLING, brethren, bow that not many wi&s;e men after the fle&s;h, not many mighty, not many noble are CALLED.</HI> The apo&s;tle cannot mean that the wi&s;e men after the fle&s;h, the mighty, and the noble, are not called by the preach|ing of the word. He preached to men of this de&s;cription when he &s;tood on Mars' hill in Athens, and he preached to them in other places. They are externally called by the works and the word of God as truly as men of the lower ranks in life, and as the &s;aved. He mu&s;t therefore mean by the <HI>calling</HI> in this text, that peculiar inward call which is given to tho&s;e who are brought into the kingdom of God. Ephes. iii. 7. <HI>Whereof I was made a mini&s;ter, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power.</HI> This effectual working of divine power which made Paul a Chri&s;tian and a mini&s;ter, was &s;omething wholly different from any thing that he was the &s;ubject of when he &s;at at the feet of Gamaliel, when he was rejoicing in the dying groans of Stephen, or in the beginning of his journey to Da|ma&s;cus, when he breathed out threatnings and &s;laughter again&s;t the di&s;ciples of the Lord. The energy of God's power men|tioned in the words ju&s;t cited, was that &s;pe|cial
<PB N="84" REF="036872_0082_100B279A51E37BA8">operation of the Holy Spirit which chan|ged his heart, and made him a real and a zealous friend to Je&s;us of Nazareth. Eph. iv. 4. <HI>There is one body, and one &s;pirit, even as ye are CALLED</HI> in one hope of your <HI>CALLING.</HI> Believers are the per&s;ons here addre&s;&s;ed. There is a <HI>calling</HI> common to them all&mdash;they have the &s;ame hope of heaven. There is nothing in this text which countenances the idea that the calling of unbelievers is of the &s;ame general nature with that which believ|ers have; but the calling is con&s;idered as peculiar to the latter. 1 Timothy vi. 12. <HI>Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art al&s;o CALLED.</HI> The <HI>calling</HI> of Timothy implies the &s;ame with his being made an heir of glory.</P>
<P>AFTER the remarks which have been made on the texts quoted in &s;upport of the pecu|liar call given to the regenerate, it will be unnece&s;&s;ary to comment on the following. 2 Timothy i. 9. <HI>Who hath &s;aved us, and CAL|LED us with an HOLY CALLING, not according to our works, but according to his own purpo&s;e and grace, which was given us in Chri&s;t Je&s;us before the world began.</HI> Heb. iii. 1.&mdash;<HI>Holy brethren, partakers of the HEAVENLY CALLING.</HI> Jude i.&mdash;<HI>To them that are &s;anctified by God the Father, and pre&s;erved in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and CALLED.</HI> Rev. xvii. 14. <HI>The&s;e &s;hall make
<PB N="85" REF="036872_0083_100B279CA8063F10">war with the Lamb, and the Lamb &s;hall over|come them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings; and they that are with him are CAL|LED, and cho&s;en, and faithful.</HI></P>
<P>THE foregoing and &s;imilar &s;cripture pa&s;|&s;ages prove, that the regenerate are the &s;ub|jects of a call from God of which the un|regenerate are not partakers. In the new birth a call is given by the &s;pirit of God, which is different in <HI>kind</HI> from any which is given to tho&s;e who die in their &s;ins. This peculiar call is what Calvini&s;tic divines have &s;tiled <HI>Effectual Calling.</HI> It mu&s;t follow from the doctrine of total depravity that in regen|eration a will is given by the &s;pirit of God, to which the former will of the &s;ubject of this change was wholly oppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>ARE there any pre&s;ent who have pa&s;&s;ed from death unto life, and can clearly trace the exerci&s;es of their own minds which pre|ceded this change, to you I appeal in partic|ular, in &s;upport of the doctrine of &s;ove|reign efficacious grace di&s;played in regene|ration. Did you not when fir&s;t alarmed with terrible apprehen&s;ions of future mi&s;e|ry, &s;trive to bani&s;h tho&s;e fears, by running into vain company, by bu&s;ine&s;s, or in &s;ome other way? Did you not exert your&s;elves to quiet your con&s;ciences by doings which fall e&s;&s;entially &s;hort of reconciliation to God?
<PB N="86" REF="036872_0084_100B279FD5DE1D30">Did you not contend with him becau&s;e he would not give you peace &s;hort of uncondi|tional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his will? Did you not complain of him for condemning you for &s;in, and for requiring of you a holy heart? Did you not within your&s;elves cavil at the doctrines of grace, and call God a hard ma&s;ter? What wicked excu&s;es did you frame to ju&s;tify your ob&s;tinacy in refu&s;ing to turn unto him? What horrid thoughts of the glorious maje&s;ty of heaven and earth did you indulge? You know&mdash;you feel, that if God had not &s;topped you in your dreadful career, and &s;ilenced your objections by his &s;pirit, you would have remained his enemies, and have gone on to fit your&s;elves for everla&s;t|ing de&s;truction. You cannot attribute the change of your hearts to any of your exer|tions, but you a&s;cribe it to Him who is rich in mercy. The God of all grace hath called you unto his eternal glory by Chri&s;t Je&s;us: To Him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. AMEN.</P>

<P>THE Holy Gho&s;t &s;peaketh to all men in the &s;criptures; but many who are acquaint|ed with the&s;e writings di&s;obey his voice, or re&s;i&s;t him.

<P>FROM what has been &s;aid we may deter|mine that the Holy Gho&s;t is given to the regenerate in a peculiar &s;en&s;e. To &s;peak in the words of the late <HI>Pre&s;ident Edwards,</HI> in

<P>To argue from the &s;ufficiency of the a|tonement made by Je&s;us Chri&s;t for the &s;al|vation of all men, that a portion of the in|fluences of the Holy Gho&s;t is put into the hearts of all men, is an erroneous way of
<PB N="92" REF="036872_0090_100B27ABEE58F5B0">rea&s;oning. By the atonement a foundation is laid for the &s;alvation of &s;inners, and in con&s;equence of this they are placed in a &s;tate of trial; but this does not imply that they have any influences of the &s;pirit operat|ing on their heart, or temper of mind. We cannot find any where in the &s;criptures that the holy &s;pirit dwelleth in the hearts of any ex|cept the regenerate. He is given to them in a peculiar &s;en&s;e, as has been proved. The a|tonement is a work <HI>without</HI> us, and by it is opened a door for our return to God. But we cannot infer from this that the heart or temper <HI>within</HI> us is altered. Impenitent &s;inners are as really the enemies of God, as if no atonement had been made. Not one of them will ever return to God if his heart be not changed by the holy &s;pirit. God lays re&s;traints on the external conduct of the wicked in their &s;tate of probation: If he did not, we do not &s;ee how the church could have been pre&s;erved on the earth with|out a con&s;tant &s;eries of miracles; but the re&s;traints under which they are laid does not re&s;pect the temper of their hearts. The impenitent remain oppo&s;ed to God, and are more criminal in their rebellion than if Chri&s;t had never appeared: John xv. 22. <HI>If I had not come and &s;poken unto them they
<PB N="93" REF="036872_0091_100ADCD4760E5160">had not had &s;in: but now they have no cloak for their &s;in.</HI></P>
<P>THE words in John i. 9, applied to Chri&s;t, <HI>That was the true Light, which light|eth every man that cometh into the world,</HI> have been brought to prove, that in con&s;equence of the atonement made by him, a portion of the influences of the Holy Spirit hath been put into the heart of every individual of the human race. In reply it may be ob&s;erved,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. THAT if the Holy Spirit dwell in the hearts of all men, then all men are the &s;ub|jects of true holine&s;s in &s;ome degree. But according to the &s;criptures all men are by nature dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, and there is not one of them while in unregeneracy that doeth good. The &s;pirit of God may awaken the con&s;ciences of &s;inners, as he doth in the preparatory work, but this is a very different thing from taking hold of their hearts. When he dwelleth in the hearts of any, their temper, or di&s;po&s;ition of mind, accords with his holy nature in &s;ome degree; and therefore if he dwell in the hearts of all men, it mu&s;t follow of cour&s;e that all men are the &s;ubjects of true holine&s;s. That
<PB N="94" REF="036872_0092_100B27B048F9B6D8">this is not the true character of mankind has already been proved.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. IT appears from the two ver&s;es next following the text under con&s;ideration, that Chri&s;t doth not dwell in the hearts of all men by his &s;pirit, in the &s;ame general &s;en&s;e; <HI>He was in the world, and the world was made by him; and the world knew him not. He came unto his own, and his own received him not.</HI> By <HI>the world</HI> is here meant the <HI>Gentile</HI> world, and by <HI>his own,</HI> the <HI>Jews,</HI> who were Chri&s;t's kindred according to the fle&s;h, and were his by profe&s;&s;ion. When he came into the world the generality of mankind rejected him, and have manife&s;ted the &s;ame temper from that day to the pre&s;ent. This enmity to the Son of God is wholly unac|countable if there be even a &s;mall &s;park of holine&s;s implanted in their hearts by the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. WHEN Chri&s;t is &s;aid to lighten ev|ery man that cometh into the world, the meaning is, that Chri&s;t is the great lumina|ry that holdeth up moral light before all men. He is the <HI>Word,</HI> or the manife&s;ter of the Deity to intelligent creatures. The whole creation is his immediate work, and he upholdeth all things by the word of his
<PB N="95" REF="036872_0093_100B27B383C1DA60">power. In the&s;e re&s;pects he holdeth up light before all mankind. In addition to the&s;e means of knowledge, he hath given to &s;ome the written word or the holy &s;criptures. Tho&s;e who are &s;aved, are divinely illumina|ted by his &s;pirit. Thus all the light in the moral creation proceedeth from Chri&s;t as the immediate fountain. The text thus ex|plained affords no countenance to the opin|ion that all men have a portion of the Holy Spirit put into their hearts.</P>
<P>THOSE who contend that the Holy Spirit is given to all men in the &s;ame general &s;en&s;e, mu&s;t hold, as many of them openly do, that the &s;aved make them&s;elves to differ from them that peri&s;h; and that, for in&s;tance, God did not impart any other or different influences of his &s;pirit to Saul of Tar&s;us in the moment of his conver&s;ion, than he had imparted to Judas I&s;cariot. However abun|dant the advocates of this opinion may be in the u&s;e of the phra&s;es <HI>Go&s;pel grace, free grace,</HI> &amp;c. and whatever profe&s;&s;ions they may make of a&s;cribing the whole of man's &s;al|vation to the mercy of God, their &s;cheme of doctrine directly tends to encourage a proud and &s;elf-righteous &s;pirit.</P>
<P>THE text in 1 Cor. xii. 7. <HI>But the mani|fe&s;tation of the &s;pirit is given to every man to pro|fit
<PB N="96" REF="036872_0094_100B27B50C0506C0">withal,</HI> has been adduced in &s;upport of the opinion that the &s;pirit of God is given to all men in the &s;ame general &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>To determine the meaning of this pa&s;&s;age, let us con&s;ult the context, begining at the 4th ver&s;e, <HI>Now, there are diver&s;ities of gifts, but the &s;ame &s;pirit. And there are differences of admini&s;trations, but the &s;ame Lord. And there are diver&s;ities of operations, but it is the &s;ame God which worketh all in all. But the mani|fe&s;tation of the &s;pirit is given to every man to pro|fit withal. For to one is given by the &s;pirit the word of wi&s;dom; to another the word of knowl|edge by the &s;ame &s;pirit; to another faith by the &s;ame &s;pirit; to another the gift of healing by the &s;ame &s;pirit; to another the working of mira|cles; to another phrophecy; to another di&s;cern|ing of &s;pirits; to another diver&s;e kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues: But all the&s;e worketh that one and the &s;elf-&s;ame &s;pir|it, dividing to every man &s;everally as he will.</HI> It is plain that the apo&s;tle is here di&s;cour&s;|ing about the <HI>gifts</HI> and not the graces of the &s;pirit. The&s;e have no nece&s;&s;ary connexion, as has been before ob&s;erved. The &s;pirit of God came upon Balaam, and upon King Saul, and they both prophe&s;ied; but nei|ther of them had any true religion. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Numb. xxiv. 2. 1 Sam. x. 10.</NOTE> When
<PB N="97" REF="036872_0095_100B27B838A530B0">the apo&s;tle &s;aith that <HI>the manife&s;tation of the &s;pirit is given to every man to profit withal,</HI> his meaning is, that whatever miraculous or other gifts, have been imparted to any mem|ber of the Chri&s;tian church, ought to be improved for the profit or edification of the whole body. The <HI>faith</HI> which is mentioned in the context is of the extraordinary kind, or of a kind which is not common to believ|ers; as it is enumerated among the other gifts, and repre&s;ented as not being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by all to whom the &s;pirit is given. Since, therefore the apo&s;tle here confines his di&s;|cour&s;e to the gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t, no argument can be drawn from the 7th ver&s;e in &s;upport of the opinion that the &s;pirit of God dwelleth in the hearts of all men.</P>

Such per&s;ons deny a doctrine which is plainly taught in the &s;criptures; and by &s;ure con&s;equence flatter them&s;elves and others with the belief of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing de|&s;ires and purpo&s;es to which they are &s;tran|gers.</P>
<P>MEN may walk, may till the ground, and may do any of the common actions of life, without any other influence of the Deity than that which pervades the univer&s;e, and upholds all creatures in exi&s;tence.

<P>CHRIST directed his di&s;ciples when he &s;ent them out to preach the go&s;pel, that if the members of any family, or the inhab|itants of any city or town, would not receive them, or hear their words, to depart from tho&s;e hardened &s;inners, and to &s;hake off the du&s;t of their feet as a te&s;timony again&s;t them. In&s;tances may now occur in which the min|i&s;ters of the go&s;pel are required to depart from particular places, on account of the treatment they receive from the people. There may be particular families or per&s;ons near them to whom they can have no acce&s;s; and any attempt to coun&s;el or warn them would be like ca&s;ting pearls before &s;wine. But let none of the &s;ervants of the Mo&s;t High be ha&s;ty in concluding that the door

We cannot, my brethren, if our hearts be warmed with Chri&s;tian benev|olence, cea&s;e to pray for &s;inners, though we may feel the effects of their enmity, and their ears may be &s;hut again&s;t us. God may hereafter &s;end his &s;pirit into their hearts, and give them repentance to the acknowl|edging of the truth. The time may come when they will e&s;teem the followers of the Saviour as the excellent of the earth, and choo&s;e them for their companions. Such a change has been &s;een in every age, to the joy of the people of God. His arm is not &s;hortened that it cannot &s;ave, neither is his ear heavy that it cannot hear.</P>

<HEAD>DISCOURSE V. The Character of the Regenerate; or true Religion di&s;tingui&s;hed from fal&s;e.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>I JOHN iv. 7.</HI></BIBL>
<P>&mdash;EVERY one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>HAVING in the foregoing di&s;cour&s;es con&s;idered the nature, nece&s;&s;ity, and Author of the new birth, I proceed to con|&s;ider the fruits or effects of this change. Let us, my brethren, deal impartially with our&s;elves while we are attending to the character of the regenerate. May God en|lighten our minds by his &s;pirit, that we
<PB N="116" REF="036872_0114_100B27DFDCC33C48">may plainly di&s;tingui&s;h true religion from fal&s;e.</P>
<P>IT is declared by the in&s;pired writer in the text, that <HI>every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.</HI> This love is con|&s;idered in the context, as entering into the nature of the confe&s;&s;ion&mdash;<HI>That Je&s;us Chri&s;t is come in the fle&s;h;</HI> which confe&s;&s;ion di&s;tin|gui&s;hed <HI>the &s;pirit of truth from the &s;pirit of er|ror.</HI> That faith in the Son of God which is ju&s;tifying <HI>worketh by love.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. v. 6.</NOTE> Every one who is renewed in the &s;pirit of his mind, or knoweth God, is a &s;ubject of this love.</P>
<P>THE ultimate object of our love is always plea&s;ing to us; and whatever this be, it de|termines our character. If our hearts be placed on earthly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, we are gov|erned by the love of the world. If we <HI>love the prai&s;e of men more than the prai&s;e of God,</HI> ambition is the idol which we adore. If &s;en&s;ual indulgencies be our chief pur|&s;uit, we are lovers of &s;inful plea&s;ure. If our highe&s;t affections be placed on the in|finite mind, we are governed by the love of God. <HI>Know ye not,</HI> &s;aith the apo&s;tle, <HI>that to whom ye yield your&s;elves &s;ervants to obey, his
<PB N="117" REF="036872_0115_100B27E20B6BEB70">&s;ervants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of &s;in unto death, or of obedience unto righteou&s;|ne&s;s?</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. vi. 16.</NOTE> We hear the &s;ame language from the lips of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>No man can &s;erve to ma&s;ters; for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or el&s;e he will hold to the one, and de&s;pi&s;e the other. Ye cannot &s;erve God and mammon.</HI></P>
<P>LET us, my brethren, make the inquiry in the pre&s;ence of a holy God, whether we are devoted to him, and are become the &s;ervants of righteou&s;ne&s;s? Let us take heed how we hear while we are looking into the nature of that love which forms the char|acter of tho&s;e who are born again. If there be any pre&s;ent who have no de&s;ire to &s;earch and try their ways, let them know that their &s;tate is mo&s;t alarming.</P>
<P>EVERY one who has much acquaintance with the &s;criptures, mu&s;t have ob&s;erved that in them great &s;tre&s;s is laid upon holy love, as being the foundation of true piety. <HI>Love in the fulfilling of the law.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiii. 10.</NOTE> When one of the Jewi&s;h doctors a&s;ked Chri&s;t, "Which is the great commandment in the law?" the divine teacher replied, <HI>Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all
<PB N="118" REF="036872_0116_100B27E4377F7560">thy &s;oul, and with all thy mind. This is the fir&s;t and great commandment. And the &s;econd is like unto it, Thou &s;halt love thy neighbor as thy&s;elf. On the&s;e two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. xxii. 36&mdash;40.</NOTE> This law Chri&s;t perfectly obeyed while he was on the earth, and to redeem &s;inners from its cur&s;e he di|ed on the cro&s;s. The love enjoined by this law con&s;tituted the moral image of God on the heart of man when he was created. The &s;ame moral image is re&s;tored in regen|eration. Though the law has cea&s;ed as a covenant, it remains as a rule of life. It will forever continue as the &s;tandard of ho|line&s;s. To this man's heart mu&s;t be con|formed, or he mu&s;t peri&s;h. The go&s;pel breathes the &s;ame &s;pirit with the law. We cannot embrace the go&s;pel in a &s;aving man|ner, if we do not love God with all our hearts and our neighbor as our&s;elves. It is by this love only that our hearts can become united with the kingdom and glory of God, and with the real good of our fellow-crea|tures. Charity, or love, is the bond of perfectne&s;s. This makes intelligent beings one in intere&s;t and enjoyment under all cir|cum&s;tances, and forever. This moral union is involved in the prayer which Chri&s;t offered up a little before his death, for all the mem|bers
<PB N="119" REF="036872_0117_100B27E6693F72C0">of his my&s;tical body, in every age. John xvii. 20, 21, 22. <HI>Neither pray I for the&s;e alone, but for them al&s;o which &s;hall be|lieve on me through their word that they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they al&s;o may be one in us; that the world may believe that thou ha&s;t &s;ent me. And the glory which thou gave&s;t me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one.</HI></P>
<P>FROM the agreement of the &s;pirit of the law and the go&s;pel, it appears that no one can be a friend of the latter who is an ene|my to the former. If the law be not holy, ju&s;t and good, there can be no grace in the go&s;pel. There can be no grace or mercy, in &s;aving any one from the puni&s;hment which is threatened by an unju&s;t law: He can claim deliverance on the footing of ju&s;|tice.</P>
<P>THE moral law is an object which is plea&s;|ing to every pious mind. The apo&s;tle Paul <HI>delighted in is after the inward man.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Rom. vii. 22.</NOTE> No be|liever de&s;ires ju&s;tification in the &s;ight of God by the deeds of the law; becau&s;e &s;uch de&s;ire would be incon&s;i&s;tent with his love to the law, and to the glory of its divine Au|thor. All who are born again heartily ac|tion
<PB N="120" REF="036872_0118_100B27E8924E4398">knowledge that they ju&s;tly de&s;erve everla&s;t|ing mi&s;ery for tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the law of God. This view of them&s;elves prepares the way for them to di&s;cern the beauty and glory of the Mediator.</P>
<P>IN further di&s;cour&s;ing from the words of the text, let us attend,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. To &s;ome of the exerci&s;es of Chri&s;tian love towards God. The regenerate are conformed to him in heart; they are united with him in love; ver&s;e 16th of the context&mdash;<HI>God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.</HI></P>
<P>GOD nece&s;&s;arily delighteth in the highe&s;t good, or the greate&s;t degree of happine&s;s, that can exi&s;t, and choo&s;eth a plan for its attainment. He cannot fail of accompli&s;h|ing his de&s;ign; &s;ince in him are united in|finite knowledge, power, and wi&s;dom, with infinite love. God declareth his glory in the works of his hand; and in the&s;e he de|lighteth, as they make known to intelligent creatures the fountain of goodne&s;s which exi&s;teth from eternity in him. <HI>The glory of the Lord &s;hall endure forever; the Lord &s;hall rejoice in his works.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm civ. 31.</NOTE> Creatures are happy when their hearts are placed on the glory,
<PB N="121" REF="036872_0119_100B27EAB5B23F10">or ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, of the divine mind. When they love God they become members of his holy intelligent kingdom, and give them|&s;elves up to Him who is over all, and is the &s;um of being and happine&s;s. The happi|ne&s;s and glory of the kingdom of God are the &s;ame with his own glory: They cannot be &s;eparated. Whatever promoteth the former, promoteth the latter. It is every way be&s;t&mdash;it is mo&s;t for the happine&s;s of intelligent creatures, that God &s;hould make his own glory his chief end. The happi|ne&s;s found in communion with God is infi|nitely higher than can be found in any cre|ated good.</P>
<P>THE &s;aint rejoiceth that Jehovah is on the throne of the univer&s;e. The language of his heart is, <HI>Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be above all the earth.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm lvii. 11.</NOTE> <HI>Ble&s;s the Lord, all his works, in all places of his dominion; ble&s;s the Lord, O my &s;oul.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm ciii. 22.</NOTE> If we love God, my brethren, we &s;hall choo&s;e to lie at his foot&s;tool, and to be wholly un|der his dominion. We &s;hall abhor our&s;elves and repent in du&s;t and a&s;hes, for our rebel|lion again&s;t the holy and righteous Governor of the univer&s;e. We &s;hall as perfectly ap|prove of the ju&s;tice which condemneth us,

<P>THEY who have the love of God &s;hed abroad in their hearts delight in his mercy as he cau&s;ed it to be proclaimed before Mo|&s;es, Exodus xxxiii. 19. <HI>And he &s;aid, I will make all my goodne&s;s pa&s;s before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will &s;hew mercy on whom I will &s;hew mercy.</HI> Chri&s;t's followers join with him in the adora|tion, <HI>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven and earth, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t hid the&s;e things from the wi&s;e and prudent, and ha&s;t revealed them unto babes. Even &s;o, Father; for &s;o it &s;eemed good in thy &s;ight.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. xi. 25, 26.</NOTE> If we love God we &s;hall not complain of his conduct in &s;ending his &s;pirit into one congregation, and not into another; into one family and not into a|nother; and into the heart of &s;ome one or more of the family, in di&s;tinction from the other members who compo&s;e it. We know from the character of Jehovah that he will, in the kingdom of his grace, as well as in the kingdom of his providence, do that which infinite love, or a &s;upreme regard to the happine&s;s of his holy kingdom, requir|eth. The monuments of vindictive wrath
<PB N="123" REF="036872_0121_100B27F000BF8740">can have no ju&s;t cau&s;e of complaint; be|cau&s;e they de&s;erve endle&s;s puni&s;hment as &s;inners; nor do they de&s;erve this the le&s;s on account of the mercy &s;hown to others.</P>
<P>THE particular rea&s;ons of the difference which God maketh between the character and &s;tate of the &s;aved and the lo&s;t, are not revealed to us; but if we love him we &s;hall believe that his conduct in the ca&s;e before us, is dictated by that benevolence which &s;eeketh the greate&s;t &s;um of intelligent hap|pine&s;s. To accompli&s;h this de&s;ign is wor|thy of infinite wi&s;dom and love. The di|vine &s;overeignty is an odious doctrine to an un&s;anctified heart; but when it is clearly placed before the minds of the friends of God, they will rejoice in it. They are fully convinced that if God had not &s;hown mercy to them until they had made them&s;elves to differ from their fellow-&s;inners, they had eternally peri&s;hed: and they believe that it is every way fit, and be&s;t for the univer&s;e, that the &s;upreme Ruler &s;hould be actuated in his conduct towards all his creatures, in the pre&s;ent world, and in the world to come, by rea&s;ons which are contained in his infinite wi&s;dom and rectitude.</P>

<P>BEFORE I leave this part of the &s;ubject, I would take occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, that we cannot determine what particular holy ex|erci&s;es will be fir&s;t perceived by tho&s;e who are born of God. A great variety is found in their experiences in this re&s;pect. Some fir&s;t perceive a new beauty in the works of nature around them; and their minds are filled with a plea&s;ing &s;olemn &s;en&s;e of the pre&s;ence and glory of God. Others are delighted in contemplating &s;ome one of the attributes of the Deity. Sometimes the at|tention of the regenerate is fir&s;t fixed on the per&s;on, or offices of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Not a few have found their cavillings &s;tilled for the fir&s;t time by a view of the rectitude and goodne&s;s of the divine government. Their hearts are charmed with the object before them, and they are a&s;toni&s;hed at their pa&s;t ob&s;tinacy and blindne&s;s. Mo&s;t commonly the fir&s;t exerci&s;es of the new man are in view of &s;ome doctrine, or part of the di|vine conduct, with which the heart had
<PB N="130" REF="036872_0128_100B27FE8D3EF208">been mo&s;t immediately contending. Some fir&s;t ta&s;te that the Lord is gracious in the channel of &s;ome pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture brought to their minds; and others have no particu|lar part of the written word in their thoughts, at that time. It often happens that a con|&s;iderable length of time pa&s;&s;es after the dawning of divine light on the &s;ouls of the regenerate, before they think any thing about their own conver&s;ion. The beauty and the glory which captivate their hearts take off their attention from them&s;elves. They are heard to &s;ay afterwards to their Chri&s;tian friends, with reference to the hap|py time when divine truth fir&s;t appeared in a new light, <Q>We did not inquire whether we &s;hould be &s;aved or lo&s;t; but we were &s;wallowed up in contemplating the glory of God. We felt willing to be in his hand. We rejoiced in his government, and that his holy name will be magnified for ever.</Q></P>
<P>THE few in&s;tances which have been men|tioned, may &s;erve as a &s;pecimen of the ma|ny which might be adduced to illu&s;trate the variety ob&s;ervable in the earlie&s;t di&s;cov|eries made to the regenerate. Let the im|mediate object of their fir&s;t and &s;ub&s;equent exerci&s;es be what it may, the temper of
<PB N="131" REF="036872_0129_100B2800E409CCB0">heart implied in them is the &s;ame in its na|ture. There is no other difference between the exerci&s;es of the renewed heart than is occa&s;ioned by different objects. The heart that is delighted in contemplating one part of the moral works of God, will be delighted in contemplating any other part as it cometh into view. If we love one attribute of Je|hovah, we love his whole character. If for in&s;tance, we love his mercy, we love his ju&s;tice and his truth, and every other moral attribute. If we love his character we &s;hall feel glad that he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of infinite knowledge and power, and that he cannot fail of accompli&s;hing whatever he plea&s;eth: Hence, we &s;hall find holy enjoyment in view|ing the natural perfections of the Mo&s;t High. If we cordially embrace Je&s;us Chri&s;t, we &s;hall delight in the law which he honored by his obedience and death. If we be friends to the divine government in any particular branch of it, we are friends to its whole plan. As our minds are limited, we mu&s;t attend to one thing at a time; but as there is perfect unity of character and de&s;ign in God, we &s;hall, if renewed in the &s;pirit of our minds, be &s;atisfied with any and every part of either, when it is &s;et before us. All God's children have been made to drink in|to one &s;pirit; whatever variety exi&s;ts in the

John exhorteth in the beginning of the ver&s;e which contains the text, <HI>Beloved, let us love one another.</HI> The &s;ame exhortation is &s;ound in many other places in this epi&s;tle. Though he may have more immediately in view, in the words ju&s;t quoted, the love which Chri&s;tians ought to exerci&s;e towards each other, the love of benevolence towards all mankind is not excluded. Brotherly love cannot exi&s;t without this, and is built upon it. We are commanded <HI>to love our neighbor as our&s;elves.</HI> To enjoin and enforce this love, is the de|&s;ign of the &s;ix la&s;t commandments in the decalogue.</P>
<P>IF we love God we &s;hall con&s;ider the hap|pine&s;s of our neighbor as being of as much importance as our own.

<P>IF Chri&s;tians did not love the felicity and glory of God's kingdom above the happi|ne&s;s of individuals, they would be incon|&s;olable in reflecting on the mi&s;ery of any part of the intelligent creation.

<P>LOVE is delighted in finding kindred &s;ouls.

<PB N="137" REF="036872_0135_100B280E85FD2848">are placed on the kingdom of the Redeemer. The apo&s;tle Paul, in his fir&s;t epi&s;tle to the church of the The&s;&s;alonians, addre&s;&s;eth the brethren, in chap. iv. 9, in the following words, <HI>But as touching brotherly love, ye need not that I write unto you; for ye your&s;elves are taught of God to love one another.</HI> John &s;aith, <HI>We know that we have pa&s;&s;ed from death unto life, becau&s;e we love the brethren.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 John iii. 14.</NOTE> If we love God we &s;hall rejoice in beholding his image in any of the human race; whether high or low, rich or poor, bond or free.

<P>OUR zeal on this &s;ubject will not be ac|cording to knowledge if we &s;uppo&s;e it to be impo&s;&s;ible to love one as a brother in Chri&s;t, if the per&s;on &s;o loved be not a true believer, We cannot indeed regard one as a follower of the Son of God, if he do not appear, in a judgment of charity, to have his Spirit; but as we cannot certainly know the heart of another we are liable to be deceived in our opinion of him. If we feel a compla|cency in any one on account of his appa|rent friend&s;hip to Chri&s;t, this is a good ev|idence
<PB N="138" REF="036872_0136_100B28118FAF3A70">that <HI>we</HI> are Chri&s;tians; but it is no certain evidence that the per&s;on &s;o loved is a real Chri&s;tian.

The promi&s;e of heaven which is made to expre&s;&s;ions of brotherly love, doth not imply that the per&s;on who is the object of it is a member of Chri&s;t's my&s;tical body. Matth. x. 42. <HI>And who&s;oever &s;hall give to drink unto one of the&s;e little ones a cup of cold water only, in the name of a di&s;ciple, verily I &s;ay unto you, He &s;hall in no wi&s;e lo&s;e his reward.</HI> We may ob&s;erve that it is not affirmed that the one to whom the cup of cold water is given &s;hall have eternal life, as all true believers will; but the promi&s;e is made <HI>to him that giveth a cup of cold water, in the name of a di&s;ciple.</HI> It is promi&s;ed that <HI>he, the donor, &s;hall in no wi&s;e lo&s;e his reward.</HI> He will be owned, in this very act, by Chri&s;t in the day of Judg|ment,

<P>IN avoiding the error into whith &s;ome have run in holding to the certain knowl|edge of Chri&s;tians, let us not go into the oppo&s;ite extreme of allowing no other te&s;t of brotherly love than will perfectly &s;uit the ta&s;te of the mere formali&s;t. The regenerate honor them that fear the Lord, choo&s;e them for their companions, and prize their &s;ociety far a|bove that of the great and the honorable of the earth who deny the power of godline&s;s. They who are born of God bear the bur|dens of their brethren, and rejoice in their growth in grace. They &s;eek to unbo&s;om them&s;elves to Chri&s;tians of higher attain|ments in knowledge and holine&s;s, and are edified in li&s;tening to their coun&s;els and ad|monitions.

<P N="3">3dly. THE love which is the fruit of the Holy Spirit, influences to a life of obedience to God's commandments.</P>
<P>LOVE in the heart is an active principle; and is the &s;um of all that God requireth of
<PB N="140" REF="036872_0138_100B28155AB17348">man. This leads to a cour&s;e of behavior which is conformable to the laws and ordi|nances of the &s;upreme King. Holy obedi|ence is not founded on mercenary motives, or &s;lavi&s;h fear, but &s;prings from a de&s;ire to promote the declarative glory of God.</P>
<P>GREAT &s;tre&s;s is laid on Chri&s;tian practice in the &s;criptures: John xiv. 23. <HI>Je&s;us an|&s;wered, and &s;aid unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words; and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.</HI> No profe&s;&s;ion of love is of any worth which is not accompanied with obedience to the divine will.

Though creatures can neither defeat, nor di&s;appoint, the &s;upreme Ruler, their rebellion carries no le&s;s guilt in it, than if it could accompli&s;h its wi&s;hes.

<P>HOLY obedience hath re&s;pect to all God's commandments. If we love him we &s;hall feel a reverence for his name, when we pro|nounce it with our lips; not indulging our|&s;elves in appealing to him to give energy to trifling di&s;cour&s;e, nor in imprecating his ven|geance on our&s;elves, or on others. God's people, in all ages, have <HI>called the &s;abbath a delight,</HI> and have honored him on that day, by attending on the public ordinances of his appointment. It has been painful to them
<PB N="142" REF="036872_0140_100B281BF89C2830">to be detained from his hou&s;e, and the means of in&s;truction, or quickening, which he hath in&s;tituted. Prayer is the breath of tho&s;e who are born again. They attend to this in their hou&s;es and in the &s;anctuary. They maintain &s;ecret prayer. Love reigning in the heart inclines to the practice of the various relative and &s;ocial duties. We can|not be under the government of this holy principle, and di&s;regard ju&s;tice, mercy, truth, and the other virtues which are im|plied in the love of our neighbor. The knavery, the unmerciful temper, the back|biting, the fal&s;hood, the covetou&s;ne&s;s, and the envy which have appeared in &s;ome high profe&s;&s;ors, have brought great reproach up|on Chri&s;tianity, and have given occa&s;ion to its enemies to bla&s;pheme.

<P>THERE is &s;omething in the &s;tate of the Chri&s;tian while on earth, that is different from what we can find in any other creature in any world.

Divine grace is wonderfully di&s;played in keeping alive the &s;mall degree of holy love implant|ed in regeneration.

<P>THE leading exerci&s;es of Chri&s;tian love, and its influence on the temper and conduct of the regenerate, were con&s;idered in the la&s;t di&s;cour&s;e. In a review of the &s;ubject we are taught,</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT the love which has private or per&s;onal happine&s;s for its &s;upreme object, is e&s;&s;entially different from the love which is the fruit of the Holy Spirit.</P>

OUR private happine&s;s is of as much worth as that of any other creature who is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;ame degree of intelligent exi&s;tence; and ought to be prized and pur|&s;ued by us in &s;ubordination to the glory of God, and the happine&s;s of his moral king|dom. The only way of &s;ecuring real hap|pine&s;s to our&s;elves, is to feel &s;atisfied with our proper place in the &s;y&s;tem, and to be governed by that temper which corre&s;|ponds with our relations to God and to our rellow-creatures. Under the dominion of &s;uch exerci&s;es of heart, we &s;hall, according to our finite capacity, enjoy all the happi|ne&s;s in the kingdom of God. Hence &s;aith the apo&s;tle, when writing to his Chri&s;tian brethren&mdash;<HI>All things are yours; whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things pre&s;ent, or things to come; all are yours; and ye are Chri&s;t's; and Chri&s;t is God's.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. iii. 21, 22, 23.</NOTE></P>
<P>ALL un&s;anctified men love them&s;elves &s;upremely; and the whole of their affection towards God is grounded on the belief, or hope, that he will make them happy.

<P>THE malefactor condemned to death by human laws may, when pardoned, be fil|led with joy, and may feel warm gratitude towards the magi&s;trate who reprieved him, without the lea&s;t abhorrence of the crime which he had committed. He may, as has &s;ometimes been &s;een, be more given to deed. of violence than ever. The greate&s;t &s;in|ner may, without a change of heart, be ex|cited to a certain kind of gratitude towards God, and that to a high degree, from a be|lief that God hath &s;ecured him from the torments of hell, and will make him happy in the eternal world. This pre&s;umptuous hope is often rai&s;ed by taking hold of a text of &s;cripture brought to the mind. When Satan perverted a &s;cripture promi&s;e, to
<PB N="150" REF="036872_0148_100B282DA9056378">tempt Chri&s;t to ca&s;t him&s;elf down from a pinnacle of the temple, the Son of God re|&s;i&s;ted the adver&s;ary. Chri&s;t's followers, by &s;trength derived from him, have been able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one. But the impenitent may fall in with a perverted &s;en&s;e of &s;cripture pa&s;&s;ages, and fatally deceive them&s;elves. Were a man emboldened to perpetrate &s;ome daring crime by pleading for his &s;upport the words, <HI>Wait on the Lord, be of good courage, and be &s;hall &s;trengthen thine heart,</HI> we &s;hould pronounce him guilty of horrid pre&s;umption. The hope of that man is as truly unwarranted who concludes him&s;elf to be delivered from the cur&s;e of the law, while he remains in impenitence, becau&s;e &s;ome text of &s;cripture comes into his mind and he takes comfort from it; &s;uch as <HI>Son, be of good cheer, thy &s;ins are forgiven thee.</HI> We have no authority to be comforted by any promi&s;e made to be|lievers unle&s;s we po&s;&s;e&s;s their character. We mu&s;t be the &s;ubjects of evangelical re|pentance, or we can have no ju&s;t evidence that we are forgiven, and are made heirs according to the hope of eternal life. We mu&s;t fir&s;t find love to God in our hearts before we can know, or have the &s;malle&s;t rea&s;on to conclude, that we are his children.</P>
<P>IT may here be inquired in what &s;en&s;e the 19th ver&s;e of the context is to be under|
<PB N="151" REF="036872_0149_100B2831068046B0">&s;tood, <HI>We love him, becau&s;e he fir&s;t loved us.</HI> We may learn the meaning of the&s;e words by looking back to the 9th and 10th ver&s;es, <HI>In this was manife&s;ted the love of God toward us, becau&s;e that God &s;ent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and &s;ent his Son to be the propitia|tion for our &s;ins.</HI> God provided a Saviour through the infinite love of his benevolent mind. If he had not done this, and &s;ent his Spirit to operate on the hearts of the children of men, none of them would have loved him, and have been &s;aved. The love which is in the hearts of the regenerate is the fruit, or the effect, of that love which hath exi&s;ted in the divine mind from eter|nity. Their hearts are not fir&s;t drawn out in love to God by believing that God loved them in particular. God loveth his chil|dren with the love of complacency; becau&s;e they wear his holy image, and place their hearts on his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t. John xvi. 27. <HI>For the Father him&s;elf loveth you, becau&s;e ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.</HI> It is very obvious that the love of the Father here expre&s;&s;ed, is differ|ent from the benevolence which he exerci|&s;eth towards mankind at large. When any unregenerate per&s;ons love God from a be|lief that he loveth them in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e in
<PB N="152" REF="036872_0150_100B28334B7380D8">which he loveth his own children, they be|lieve a fal&s;ehood. The regenerate feel a love to God for the excellencies of his na|ture. The divine character is the fir&s;t and the highe&s;t object of their love. When they contemplate the conduct of the Mo&s;t High in providing a ran&s;om for them while they were his enemies, they admire his di&s;|intere&s;ted love, but they do not believe that he delighted in their character while they were his enemies. If the hearts of any are fir&s;t melted into love from the belief that they &s;hall not peri&s;h, their love is &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s at bottom, and they are far from the king|dom of God.</P>
<P>SOME have affirmed that &s;inners love God when they have a full per&s;ua&s;ion that he ju&s;tifieth the ungodly through the atone|ment; becau&s;e this faith relieves their con|&s;ciences from guilt. This &s;cheme &s;uppo&s;es that holy love originates in &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and that God ju&s;tifieth an impenitent &s;inner. The exerci&s;es of heart which harmonize with this &s;cheme have no holine&s;s in them, and therefore cannot be approved by infi|nite purity. It is true that when any one is ju&s;tified on the plan of the go&s;pel, he is ungodly in the eye of the law, becau&s;e he falls very far &s;hort of its requirements; but it is at the &s;ame time true that ju&s;tifying faith
<PB N="153" REF="036872_0151_100B2834D10456A8">involves in its nature the &s;ame kind of love which the law requires. The love of God implanted in the hearts of believers is ex|preffed in repentance, and in many other ways which had not been po&s;&s;ible if man had not &s;inned; but the nature of holy love is the &s;ame under the covenant of grace, as under the covenant of works.</P>
<P>ALL fal&s;e religions, of whatever name, or appearance, are built on a &s;elfi&s;h founda|tion, and gratify a proud heart. The wor&s;t of men, who acknowledge the exi&s;tence of a God, are willing to believe that he is too merciful to puni&s;h them, and that all his at|tributes are pledged to &s;ave them from hell. Some flatter them&s;elves with the hope that if they keep them&s;elves from external vices, and maintain a decency of behaviour, they &s;hall be &s;aved. Others expect to find favor in the &s;ight of God by a momentary relent|ing near the clo&s;e of a wicked life, and by repairing to the divine mercy when they can no longer enjoy the plea&s;ures of &s;in. The&s;e per&s;ons are actuated by no better mo|tives than Joab was when he fled unto the tabernacle of the Lord, and caught hold on the horns of the altar, to e&s;cape that death which he had merited by his crimes. Their pre&s;umptuous hope will be as vain as his was,
<PB N="154" REF="036872_0152_100B283744BFCA30">in the day of the Lord's vengeance. There are others who tru&s;t in high flights of reli|gious affections, ari&s;ing from a confident be|lief that they are converted, and &s;hall go to heaven, while they di&s;cover all the bitter|ne&s;s of party zeal, and perhaps are as de&s;|titute of external morality as they are of Chri&s;tian meekne&s;s. Hypocrites may be willing to deny them&s;elves in many things, for the &s;ake of being made happy. They may, like the ancient Phari&s;ees, take upon them&s;elves much labor, and practi&s;e great au&s;terities in their religion, to &s;oothe them in their indulgence of a favorite lu&s;t. They may be willing to &s;uffer for a while, from a belief that they &s;hall receive compen&s;ation hereafter; like as the mi&s;er may choo&s;e to dre&s;s in mean apparel, and to feed on coar&s;e food, for the &s;ake of increa&s;ing his riches.&mdash; Time would fail even to hint at the various cour&s;es that run into the broad road which leadeth to de&s;truction.</P>
<P>THE Chri&s;tian giveth up him&s;elf to God without re&s;erve. He denieth him&s;elf; and <HI>counteth all things but lo&s;s for the excellency of the knowledge of Chri&s;t Je&s;us his Lord.</HI> He feels that the &s;ufferings which he is called to endure, are far le&s;s than his &s;ins de&s;erve; and believes that his calamities are nece&s;&s;ary in the coun&s;els of the Mo&s;t High, to pro|mote
<PB N="155" REF="036872_0153_100B283974965F30">the glory of his great name, and the happine&s;s of his kingdom. The Chri&s;tian rejoiceth in the government of Jehovah; and is comforted by the divine declarations which promi&s;e that the light and momentary afflictions of time, will work for the faith|ful <HI>a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</HI> He doth not, like the hypocrite, think highly of his &s;ervices, or his &s;uffer|ings; but views him&s;elf as an unprofitable &s;ervant, and laments that he exerci&s;eth &s;o little patience under his trials. The hypo|crite places all his religious enjoyment in what he &s;uppo&s;es <HI>he</HI> has done, or endured, and in what has been done for <HI>him.</HI> The enjoyment of the Chri&s;tian ari&s;es from what he di&s;covers in <HI>God,</HI> and in his holy king|dom. His love and his joy terminate on an object as much above him&s;elf as God is greater than man.</P>

Wa&s;h me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and clean&s;e me from my &s;in. For I acknouledge my tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; and my &s;in is ever before me. Again&s;t thee, thee only have I &s;inned, and done this evil in thy &s;ight; that thou mighte&s;t be ju&s;tified when thou &s;peak|e&s;t, and be clear when thou judge&s;t.</HI> The &s;ame &s;pirit runs through this P&s;alm. None can read it with an unaffected heart, when they feel lively &s;orrow on account of their back&s;lidings. When Chri&s;t turned and looked upon Peter after he had thrice denied him, the heart of that di&s;ciple was deeply wounded, as he recalled the warnings which he had received a few hours before from his Lord, and as he reflected how awfully he had fallen; he would no longer continue in his wickedne&s;s, but <HI>went out, and wept bitterly.</HI></P>

<P>WOULD you, brethren, be &s;atisfied that you are new creatures, be under the lively influence of Chri&s;tian love. Remember the words recorded in 1 John iii. 18&mdash;21. <HI>My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed, and in truth. And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and &s;hall a&s;&s;ure our hearts before him. For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confi|dence toward God.</HI> Attend to the rules of trial laid down in the 13th and 18th ver&s;es of the context, <HI>Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, becau&s;e he hath given us of his Spirit. There is no fear in love; but perfect love ca&s;teth out fear: becau&s;e fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.</HI> By the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in the hearts of the regenerate, they become the &s;ubjects of a filial fear of God. The fear which is ca&s;t out is that
<PB N="161" REF="036872_0159_100B2847744E6180">&s;lavi&s;h fear which operates on the minds of the wicked, when their con&s;ciences are awake, and they tremble, and &s;eek to hide them&s;elves from the pre&s;ence of the Lord; as did our fir&s;t parents, on the day of their apo&s;tacy, when they heard his voice in the garden. If you find the pre&s;ent influence of a childlike fear of God on your hearts, you have pre&s;ent evidence that you are born again. No one is cheered by Chri&s;tian hope while in a &s;lothful frame. Divine con&s;ola|tion is found only in a &s;ea&s;on of diligence in performing the duties of the heavenly calling. <HI>Brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election &s;ure. Add to your faith, virtue; and to virtue, knowledge; and to knowledge, temperance; and to temperance, patience; and to patience, godline&s;s; and to godline&s;s, brotherly kindne&s;s; and to brotherly kindne&s;s, charity.

<P>THE &s;elf-examination enjoined in the &s;criptures, implies a pre&s;ent approach unto God, while the heart is compared with his word. If you find that you love his char|acter as there drawn, you will have a wit|ne&s;s

<P>GOD'S children will be recovered from their lap&s;es, becau&s;e he hath promi&s;ed to keep them by his power, through faith, unto &s;alvation; but they will enjoy no peace un|til they retread the &s;teps by which they wan|dered from truth, or duty. When they turn to folly, the Lord will <HI>vi&s;it their tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions with the rod, and their iniquity with &s;tripes;</HI> but when they return by repentance from their back&s;lidings, he will <HI>make them to hear joy and gladne&s;s; that the bones which he hath broken may rejoice.</HI> The Lord's peo|ple in returning unto him will find their hope to brighten: and in &s;uch revivals they can look back with plea&s;ure on the pa&s;t days in which they enjoyed the light of his coun|tenance; and their hope will be &s;trength|ened by the retro&s;pect.</P>

The foundation of Chri&s;tian faith and hope is immoveable; but the hope of Chri&s;tians with re&s;pect to their building on this foundation, may be, and often is, &s;haken.

<P>WE may di&s;cover con&s;ummate wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s in the plan of divine grace. The comfort of Chri&s;tians depends on their living near to God.

They are not prepared for high and uninterrupted con&s;olation in the pre&s;ent world.

<P>THERE are &s;ome Chri&s;tians who&s;e a&s;&s;u|rance falls below their &s;anctification, in con|&s;equence of wrong doctrinal conceptions.

SOME Chri&s;tians have le&s;s a&s;&s;urance than others of the &s;ame degree of holine&s;s, by rea&s;on of melancholy, or temptations. Their views are clouded by the&s;e things, and they are ready to conclude that they have never put on the new man. When pious per&s;ons are inclined, either from a particular mental ca&s;t, or the glooms which ari&s;e from bodily di&s;orders, to dwell wholly on the dark &s;ide of things, they are pecul|iarly expo&s;ed to the fiery darts of Satan; and to be driven to the borders of de&s;pair. While Chri&s;tian friends think favorably of their &s;tate, the unhappy per&s;ons will admit no con&s;olation. They are much to be pit|ied, and great &s;kill is requi&s;ite in the treat|ment of them. Chri&s;tian tenderne&s;s and wi&s;dom are to be employed, in attempting to prevent the brui&s;ed reed from being bro|ken, and the &s;moking flax from being quenched.

They will, when un|der its influence, other things being equal, put on different appearances, as they are con&s;titutionally inclined to be cheerful, or gloomy; bold, or timid; confident, or doubtful; warm, or &s;edate. It is import|ant to attend to this variety of tempers, to avoid cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s, and for the &s;ake of being prepared both to receive, and to ad|mini&s;ter, &s;uitable brotherly admonition. While every charitable allowance is to be made on the ground which has been men|tioned, it is to be remembered that holy love will incline per&s;ons of whatever mental complexion, to purity of heart and life, and to be friends to the decency and order required by the go&s;pel. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When the pa&s;&s;ions become boi&s;terous, the mind is in a very unfit &s;tate for &s;erious reflection.

If public teachers make it their chief aim to addre&s;s the pa&s;&s;ions, they are either ignorant of the &s;tructure of the human mind, or they are &s;triving to promote &s;ome intere&s;t very different from the conver&s;ion of &s;ouls to God.

<P>The &s;ubjects of the late work in New-England, have freely opened the exerci&s;es of their minds to their teach|ers, and other Chri&s;tian friends; and have very generally avoided the error which Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> expo&s;es. They have not been confident of their conver&s;ion; and have been inqui&s;itive to learn the di&s;tingui&s;hing nature of real piety.

<P N="4">4. HAVING con&s;idered the nature, nece&s;|&s;ity, Author, and fruits of Regeneration, let us in concluding the &s;ubject, contemplate for a moment, the happine&s;s of the heaven|ly &s;tate&mdash;of that kingdom of glory which is the final portion of all who are born of God.</P>
<P>THE re&s;t which remaineth for the people of God, is very imperfectly under&s;tood by them in the pre&s;ent life. <HI>For we know in part, and we prophe&s;y in part. But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part &s;hall be done away. When I was a child I &s;pake as a child, I under&s;tood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childi&s;h things. For now we &s;ee through a gla&s;s darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then &s;hall I know even as al&s;o I am known.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xiii. 9&mdash;12.</NOTE> The difference between the &s;aints on earth, and the &s;aints in glory,
<PB N="176" REF="036872_0174_100B286E11B76A68">is very great. The former cannot view the kingdom of God in the &s;ame clear light, as do the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect. There is a &s;mall beginning of heaven in the heart of every one who has pa&s;&s;ed through the new birth. He hath cho&s;en the Lord for his portion, and he de&s;ires the enjoyment of him above all things. He hath had a foreta&s;te of the heavenly inheritance, and while in the earthly hou&s;e of this tabernacle he &s;ometimes groans, earne&s;tly de&s;iring to be clothed upon with his hou&s;e which is from heaven. Doubtful as the Chri&s;tian may be of his own &s;tate, there is implanted within him a holy love which prefers being pre&s;ent with the Lord to a continuance in the fle&s;h.</P>
<P>THE death of believers is an inlet to ever|la&s;ting joys. When the &s;oul is di&s;lodged from the body their eyes are in&s;tantly opened upon the world of glory. Now they are de|livered from &s;in and &s;orrow, and they behold Chri&s;t without the medium of faith. Now they realize the, formance of his gracious words, <HI>In my Father's hou&s;e are many man&s;ions: if it were not &s;o, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and pre|pare a place for you, I will come again, and re|ceive you unto my&s;elf; that where I am, there ye may be al&s;o.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xiv. 2, 3.</NOTE> In the heavenly man&s;ions,

They &s;hall hunger no more, neither thir&s;t any more; neither &s;hall the &s;un light on them, nor any heat.

<P>WHEN any from our world are received into heaven, they a&s;&s;ociate with the glorified &s;aints and the holy angels. Within a &s;hort time, my Chri&s;tian friends, you will pa&s;s through death, and will be welcomed to paradi&s;e by the angels, who are mini&s;tering &s;pirits to the heirs of &s;alvation. You will &s;oon dwell in the &s;ame &s;ociety with Noah, Abraham, I&s;aac, Jacob, Mo&s;es, Samuel, David, I&s;aiah, Daniel, Peter, James, John, Paul, and all the other holy patriarchs, prophets, and apo&s;tles, and all the &s;aints who have departed this life from the begin|ning of time. What ravi&s;hing enjoyments mu&s;t be found, in uniting with the holy throng above, in prai&s;ing God forever? They are all of one heart towards Him who &s;itteth on the throne. They are all per|fectly &s;atisfied with the places a&s;&s;igned them in the kingdom of their heavenly Father.

In heaven, the hap|pine&s;s of one is the happine&s;s of the other, the happine&s;s of each is the happine&s;s of the whole, and the happine&s;s of the whole is the happine&s;s of each. They are all un|der the full dominion of holy love. This fixes their hearts on God, and draws them to each other by a bond which is never to be di&s;&s;olved. Look up to heaven, and be|hold a perfect &s;ociety. Can you look for|ward to it, and not feel a de&s;ire to go, at the time which infinite wi&s;dom hath appoint|ed, and join with the wor&s;hippers in the new Jeru&s;alem, and mingle &s;ouls with them to eternity? They feel to them&s;elves as noth|ing in the pre&s;ence of Jehovah, and they rejoice in the plan of his government which hath been unfolding from the fir&s;t moment of created exi&s;tence. They are filled with joy in view of the glory and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of God's holy kingdom. They &s;hout, Alleluia! in beholding Him who is &s;eated on the throne of the univer&s;e, triumphing over all the &s;ubtilty and malice of earth and hell, and rendering them &s;ub&s;ervient to the de|&s;igns of his infinite love.</P>
