<HEAD>A LETTER, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Rev^d Brother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I AM extreamly &s;urpri&s;ed and &s;orry (with many others) to &s;ee your printed Letter of Remarks, on the publick Te&s;timony of the late Reverend Convention: More e&s;pecially for the Impro|priety (as I humbly conceive) of your appear|ing at the Head of this Controver&s;y, and open|ing a new Scene of Di&s;putation; and for the intemperate Spirit and De&s;ign you &s;eem to di&s;cover in the whole Perfor|mance.</P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I &s;hould have &s;ooner expected &s;uch a Letter of Remarks from almo&s;t any other Mini&s;ter in the Pro|vince than from your &s;elf, not from the lea&s;t Apprehen&s;ion of In&s;ufficiency for the Task, but con&s;idering the Spirit of Jea|lou&s;y and Separation that hath unhappily come upon you with re&s;pect to your Reverend Brethren, which meeting with a Temper, not perhaps the mo&s;t flexible, is not ea&s;ily overcome and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>I believe, it is evident to all &s;ober unprejudiced Readers, that you <HI>occupied the Room</HI> of a Remarker under a Spirit of too much Re&s;entment to &s;erve the Cau&s;e you e&s;pou&s;e, or your own Credit that is engag'd in it. Some of your good Friends would doubtle&s;s have excu&s;ed this Labour&mdash; (all Things con|&s;idered) with <HI>a Ma&s;ter &s;pare thy &s;elf.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="005202_0003_1016E3042E98B218">
I'm &s;en&s;ible, <HI>Sir,</HI> 'tis no ea&s;y Ta&s;k for Gentlemen, even of a <HI>cool Spirit,</HI> when dipt in Controver&s;y, to keep their Tem|per &s;weet and plea&s;ant, and <HI>know what Spirit they are of.</HI> And doubtle&s;s, with all your Attainments in Knowledge and Grace, you have been exerci&s;ed herein to &s;uppre&s;s the Workings of that <HI>Spirit that lu&s;teth to Envy.</HI></P>
<P>I am per&s;waded, that when you come to reflect, in the cool of the Day, on your Performance, you will &s;ee Rea&s;on to re|tract &s;ome Things, which, if I mi&s;take not, are written in a ha&s;ty Spirit, and which tend not to the U&s;e of edifying.</P>
<P>Some of your Friends are very jealous le&s;t the <HI>Archers</HI> &s;hould hit and &s;orely wound you under your pre&s;ent feeble and bro|ken State, but I would hope better Things, even in the pre|&s;ent <HI>Strife of Tongues;</HI> endeavouring to &s;tir up my &s;elf and my <HI>reverend Brethren</HI> by Way of Remembrance of that &s;acred Admonition, <HI>A &s;oft An&s;wer turneth away Wrath; but griev|ous Words &s;tir up Anger.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> my principal De&s;ign in this E&s;&s;ay (however unequal to it) is to point out &s;ome In&s;tances of that intemperate Spirit and Zeal which &s;eem to run thro' your Letter, and which I fear led you into &s;ome unhappy Mi&s;takes.</P>
<P>I think it mu&s;t be owing to &s;uch a Spirit and Zeal, that you &s;o ha&s;tily catch'd at a Shadow of Rea&s;on for attaching Dr. CHAUNCY on <HI>the Title-Page</HI> of <HI>the Te&s;timony,</HI> particularly for publi&s;hing it with SUCH A POMPOUS AND DELUSIVE TITLE. But the <HI>Dr's</HI> hand&s;ome Vindication of him&s;elf, to|gether with your Retractation, forbid all further Remarks upon this Head.</P>
<P>You are careful to repre&s;ent <Q>the Danger that Strangers may be in, of being mi&s;led into this fal&s;e Judgment, name|ly that our anniver&s;ary Convention is to be con&s;idered as a formed Body of all the Pa&s;tors of the Churches in this Pro|vince of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay,</HI> acting in their eccle&s;ia&s;tical Character, who&s;e Determinations are to be regarded as car|rying &s;ome &s;pecial Power and Authority with them, like that of a <HI>provincial Synod.</HI></Q> And then add, <Q>that our <HI>annual Convention is an A&s;&s;embly of Pa&s;tors meerly occa&s;ional, &amp;c,</HI> Page 4, 5.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="005202_0004_1016E33D81E33B08">
Now <HI>Sir,</HI> Is it not your De&s;ign by thus indu&s;triou&s;ly expo|&s;ing the Weakne&s;s of our <HI>anniver&s;ary Convention</HI> to weaken the Influence of their late &s;olemn Te&s;timony again&s;t the pre|vailing Di&s;orders of the&s;e Times? And do you think to <HI>do GOD Service</HI> by thus enervating the <HI>Force of tho&s;e right Words,</HI> as coming from a con&s;iderable Number of the Senior, very judicious and pious <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> of the&s;e Churches?</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing it be really &s;o (which I don't deny), How came you, reverend Brother, eight Years ago to &s;eparate your|&s;elf from the <HI>Convention,</HI> not only <HI>viva voce,</HI> but by a <HI>drawn In&s;trument</HI> which you read before many Witne&s;&s;es?</P>
<P>And I can't help remarking here that when you appeared, and offered to &s;peak at <HI>the late Convention,</HI> you was plea&s;ed to put the Convention upon proving this notorious Fact, which not a little &s;urpri&s;ed and moved many of your <HI>Fathers and Bre|thren.</HI> Wherefore &s;uffer me to expo&s;tulate with you reverend Brother.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Whether the ha&s;ty Temper you di&s;cover in your Letter towards Dr. CHAUNCY be not owing, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, to his openly oppo&s;ing your &s;peaking in the late <HI>Convention,</HI> 'till you were plea&s;ed to make &s;ome Retractation of your former Con|duct in &s;eparating from it?</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Whether when it was propo&s;ed by &s;ome <HI>reverend Gentle|men</HI> there pre&s;ent, that if you would plea&s;e to declare you then &s;pake as a Member of this Convention, you &s;hould have all Liberty of Speech, you did not ha&s;tily refu&s;e in the intempe|rate Heat of Spirit?</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><Q>Another fal&s;e judgment upon Matters of Fact into which you think many Readers may be led, is this, namely, That none but &s;uch as are Pa&s;tors of the Churches of the Pro|vince of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay</HI> were admitted to Vote in the late Convention, whereas 'tis well known that others were admitted to Vote who are Pa&s;tors of Churches beyond the Bounds of this Province, P. 6.</Q></P>
<P>This Repre&s;entation is evidently to &s;hew the Incon&s;i&s;tency of the Stile of the <HI>Title-Page</HI> of <HI>this Te&s;timony:</HI> But Sir, I challenge you upon this Point, viz.</P>
<P>To produce above one In&s;tance of a Pa&s;tor of a neighbour|ing Province, or Colony, that voted the Articles in the <HI>printed
<PB N="6" REF="005202_0005_1016E30834029B10">Te&s;timony,</HI> particularly the la&s;t, upon which you in&s;i&s;t mo&s;t. I don't indeed think there was &s;o much as a &s;ingle In&s;tance; to be &s;ure, I could not find one by diligent Search in the Time of it, and I heard &s;everal of the Pa&s;tors in the Province of New-Hamp&s;hire expre&s;ly declare, the Evening after, that they did not vote; tho&s;e Gentlemen mode&s;tly excu&s;ing and contenting them&s;elves with being Spectators only.</P>
<P>What a &s;lender Rea&s;on have you then for &s;uppo&s;ing as you do (Page 7.) <Q>That the Majority in the la&s;t Vote (which oc|ca&s;ion'd &s;uch Debates about the late Revival of Religion) was determined by them who are not Pa&s;tors in this Pro|vince</Q>? followed with another Suppo&s;ition and In&s;inuation, <Q>that the Vote on the la&s;t Paragraph was the Execution of a De&s;ign among a Party.</Q> Upon which I mu&s;t expre&s;s my Grief for your Sugge&s;tion of the Prevalency of a Party-Spirit in &s;uch an A&s;&s;embly of Divines.</P>
<P>Sir, having worn the <HI>Title-Page</HI> of <HI>this In&s;trument</HI> as you are pleas'd to call it, by &s;pending near &s;even Pages of Remarks up|on it, which the mo&s;t of your Readers think you might as well have &s;pared; You turn over a new Leaf, and attach the <HI>Te&s;timony</HI> it &s;elf, pa&s;&s;ing a &s;evere Cen&s;ure upon it as <Q>un|likely to have a good Effect for the Revival and Advance|ment of real, vital and practical Religion:</Q> Together with a plain In&s;inuation that the Convention who formed it had not at Heart, nor were well acquainted with, the State of Religion in this Land for &s;everal Years pa&s;t. And you free|ly declare it to be your Judgment, <Q>that if we con&s;ider it in <HI>the whole</HI> as a <HI>Te&s;timony again&s;t Di&s;orders</HI> and <HI>Errors,</HI> it pow|erfully tends to <HI>unhappy Effects,</HI> both among them <HI>who live at a great Di&s;tance from us,</HI> and among <HI>our own Churches.</HI></Q> You add al&s;o, with great Freedom of Speech, <Q>I know not, how any Thing could be better calculated and contrived to confirm the <HI>fallacious Accounts of the State of Religion in New-England,</HI> which have lately been &s;ent over to <HI>Scotland,</HI> by &s;ome virulent Oppo&s;ers of the remarkable Work of GOD's Grace, which has been carrying on in various Parts of our Land, for &s;ome Years pa&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>Reverend Sir, I'm apt to think that the Charity that be|comes a Gentleman of your Character would di&s;po&s;e you to
<PB N="7" REF="005202_0006_1016E343E2993168">put a better Con&s;truction upon the Spirit and Conduct of the late <HI>Convention.</HI>&mdash;I'm very &s;orty a Gentleman of your Station &s;hould in&s;inuate, that the <HI>Convention</HI> in&s;tead of having the State of Religion at Heart in forming this <HI>Te&s;timony, &amp;c.</HI> &mdash; were carrying on a Party De&s;ign to the Hurt and wounding of Re|ligion here, and confirming the <HI>fallacious Accounts of the State of Religion,</HI> that have been &s;ent abroad.</P>
<P>Perhaps the <HI>florid Accounts,</HI> in Favour of this <HI>remarkable Work,</HI> that have been &s;ent into <HI>Scotland from hence,</HI> have not been perfectly free from the high Charge of Fallacy; at lea&s;t I Appeal to tho&s;e worthy Gentlemen them&s;elves that have been mo&s;t early and pompous (not to &s;ay delu&s;ive) in their Accounts of the flouri&s;hing State of Religion here, whe|ther if they were to &s;end over their Accounts under the pre|&s;ent Darkne&s;s and Di&s;order attending the Work of GOD, they could in Con&s;cience make &s;uch a perfect Work of it. It is evident beyond all Contradiction, that both the plau&s;ible Ac|counts &s;ent from hence to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and from thence to us, were drawn up too &s;uddenly to give the World a ju&s;t and &s;ober Re|pre&s;entation of the State of Religion for &s;ome Years pa&s;t, as if the worthy Authors were &s;triving for the Ma&s;tery, who &s;hould be fir&s;t in this good Cau&s;e. It is ob&s;ervable that the Te&s;timonies concerning the State of Religion in foreign Parts do as widely differ, as the Te&s;timonies that are given of it from among our &s;elves; and it is no ea&s;y Matter to &s;ift out the Truth: Nor do I at all wonder, that &s;ome &s;erious and inqui&s;itive Gen|tlemen in <HI>Scotland</HI> are very de&s;irous of being informed of the true Sentiments of the Body of the Clergy of this Pro|vince concerning it, which &s;ome may perhaps fear may be col|lected, both from the Rev. Mr. <HI>Appleton</HI>'s Convention <HI>Sermon,</HI> printed at the almo&s;t <HI>univer&s;al</HI> De&s;ire of the late <HI>Convention of Pa&s;tors,</HI> and al&s;o from their <HI>printed Te&s;timony again&s;t the Errors and Di&s;orders in the Land.</HI></P>
<P>You are plea&s;ed Sir (Page 8.) to mention &s;everal Authors of the&s;e <HI>fallacious Accounts,</HI> who&s;e Vindication it is not my Bu&s;ine&s;s to attempt, neither do I &s;uppo&s;e they would de|&s;ire it of me con&s;idering their own Abilities to vindicate them|&s;elves: Only, you mu&s;t excu&s;e me if I &s;ay you appear to do it with a Sneer, as if the Characters of &s;ome of them were &s;o
<PB N="8" REF="005202_0007_1016E2D580651300">exceptionable as to render their Accounts &s;u&s;pected; but Truth is great, and may be &s;poken by an Oppo&s;er.</P>
<P>Dear Sir, &s;uffer me to remark here what, as far as I under|&s;tand, is univer&s;ally noticed, <HI>viz.</HI> That you would have done your&s;elf much more Honour, if you had &s;pared the Rev. Mr. <HI>Mather,</HI> and your Marginal Note upon him. Don't you now really think &s;o your&s;elf, con&s;idering old Things that are pa&s;&s;|ed away? Don't there &s;eem to be one Ounce of the old Leaven in your Sowerne&s;s towards your late Rev. Colleague? If it be &s;o, as a Man of GOD, you will diligently &s;earch and purge it out.</P>
<P>YOU, and others, in the &s;ame Way of thinking, may repre&s;ent the&s;e Accounts in as dim a Light as you plea&s;e, yet nothing is more notorious, than that within the&s;e two or three Years pa&s;t, Antinomian and Famili&s;tical Errors, Enthu&s;ia&s;m, gro&s;s Delu&s;i|ons, and &s;candalous Di&s;orders of various Kinds, have been la|mentably prevailing in our Churches to the great Darkening and Hindrance of the Work of GOD. And true it is, that this printed Te&s;timony of the late Convention tends to put this Matter beyond all Di&s;pute, and if it &s;o happens that this Te&s;timony contradicts &s;ome ha&s;ty Accounts of the late Revi|val of Religion in <HI>New-England</HI> that have been &s;ent abroad, why &s;hould the Convention be blamed when they are called to make a faithful Declaration again&s;t the manife&s;t Di&s;orders that have attended it.</P>
<P>I can't imagine, Sir, how &s;uch a <HI>Te&s;timony</HI> again&s;t <HI>Errors</HI> and <HI>Di&s;orders</HI> &s;hould tend to increa&s;e them, and ob&s;truct the Pro|gre&s;s of GOD's Work, as you in&s;inuate and &s;ay, Page 10. I am more apt to think, it hath a direct Tendency to prevent the Growth of Errors; and &s;o to promote the Work of GOD's Grace in the Land. And I'm confident, that if the Pa&s;tors of the&s;e Churches had acted more clo&s;ely up to the Rev. Mr. <HI>Tennent's Maxim, Principiis ob&s;ta, to cru&s;h the Cockatrice in the Egg,</HI> (and I wi&s;h he him&s;elf had begun &s;ooner to practi&s;e upon it) it would have been an excellent Pre&s;ervative again&s;t the grow|ing Di&s;orders of the&s;e Times; and &s;o would have &s;hortned, if not &s;uper&s;eded <HI>the printed Te&s;timony.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, I'm much confirmed in this Opinion, becau&s;e it is evident that in the In&s;tance of Vi&s;ions and Trances, which
<PB N="9" REF="005202_0008_1016E3456BBF9D90">Mini&s;ters in general were zealous to oppo&s;e at fir&s;t, are I think univer&s;ally cea&s;ed in the Land. Whereas, if they had been countenanced by a Number of the Leaders of this People, we had been furni&s;hed long ago with &s;ufficient to have made a <HI>Romi&s;h Legend.</HI></P>
<P>This makes me think, that the Silence of Mini&s;ters in bear|ing a faithful and &s;ea&s;onable Te&s;timony again&s;t Di&s;orders is the blameable Cau&s;e of their Increa&s;e and Continuance among us. Many Pa&s;tors of this Convention apprehended that Ne|ce&s;&s;ity was laid upon them now, at lea&s;t, to te&s;tify publickly a|gain&s;t tho&s;e growing Di&s;orders: Neither have I any Rea&s;on to &s;urmi&s;e, but that they form'd their Te&s;timony from a &s;erious and hearty Concern for the flouri&s;hing State of Religion in the Land.</P>
<P>I would charitably hope with you, Reverend Sir, that many <Q>among our &s;elves have lately experienced a &s;aving Conver|&s;ion to GOD; but mu&s;t di&s;&s;ent from you in <HI>&s;uppo&s;ing that they will be tempted to entertain Prejudices again&s;t their own Pa&s;tors, as well as other Mini&s;ters</HI></Q> becau&s;e they gave not a fuller Atte&s;tation to a remarkable Revival of Religion in vari|ous Parts of the Land. I rather think &s;uch as are true Con|verts will judge their Pa&s;tors faithful in making &s;uch a Stand again&s;t prevailing Di&s;orders, which threaten to de&s;troy the Work of GOD.</P>
<P>Moreover, I've Rea&s;on to think that Multitudes in tho&s;e Places that have been rent with them, as well as others, had great Expectation of receiving &s;uch a faithful Te&s;timony from the late Convention of Pa&s;tors; and I'm &s;orely grieved that you rai&s;e and &s;anctify Prejudices in the Minds of People upon this Head that may be in Danger of <HI>leavening the whole Lump.</HI> For 'tis very evident that the Minds of many are unhappily leavened with Prejudice already again&s;t their faithful Pa&s;tors, and we need not help forward their Afflictions.</P>
<P>You then proceed, <HI>Sir,</HI> (in <HI>Page</HI> 10) by Way of Preventi|on or Correction of the &s;uppo&s;ed bad Effects of this <HI>Te&s;timony,</HI> both at Home and abroad to publi&s;hd to the World as unde|niable Matter of <HI>Fact,</HI> (I) That &s;carce one third Part of the "Pa&s;tors of the Churches of this Province were pre&s;ent at the "late Convention. True: And what then? Are they not
<PB N="10" REF="005202_0009_1016E3514FC5D398">for all that properly &s;tiled the Convention of Pa&s;tors of this Province? Were there not as many pre&s;ent at this Conven|tion as has been known at any Time? I know very well that the Paucity of the Number has not been admitted as any Ob|jection again&s;t their acting in &s;ome important Affairs, particu|larly in di&s;tributing the charitable Collection from Year to Year. Though if there be any Defect in the Di&s;tribution of it, I hope it will be remedied by preaching the Convention-Sermon for the future, at nine o'Clock in the Morning.</P>
<P>You affirm al&s;o (2) <Q>That of tho&s;e Pa&s;tors who were pre|&s;ent, it was but a &s;mall Majority that voted the la&s;t Article or Paragraph, which cau&s;ed &s;uch Debates about an Atte&s;|tation to the Work of GOD's Grace, appearing of late Years in a remarkable Revival of Religion among the&s;e Churches.</Q></P>
<P>You then appeal, Sir, to the Rev. Moderator that <Q>upon counting the Votes, when there were at lea&s;t <HI>&s;eventy Mini&s;|ters</HI> pre&s;ent, he declared that <HI>Thirty Eight</HI> was the Number who voted in the Affirmative.</Q></P>
<P>You offer &s;everal concurring Circum&s;tances to &s;upport this Fact, and expre&s;s your Surpri&s;e to have heard this Point, con|te&s;ted and denied more than once by &s;ome, and at length you &s;ay, <Q>You are per&s;waded the Moderator will be ready at any Time to atte&s;t this Fact.</Q></P>
<P>Whereupon, apprehending I had a ju&s;t Right to be a&s;cer|tained of it, I &s;ent a Letter to the Rev. Moderator <HI>July</HI> 1. hum|bly reque&s;ting him to certify me of two Facts, very confident|ly a&s;&s;erted in your Letter, about which I was of doubtful Mind; viz. The foremention'd Fact, and that mention'd in Page 3. of your <HI>printed Letter, whether he plainly told that A&s;&s;embly, he could not &s;ub&s;cribe the Te&s;timony for him&s;elf per&s;onally: Upon which there was a Vote for his &s;igning it as Moderator.</HI> But that good Gentleman refu&s;ed to give me any Satisfaction in either of the&s;e Points, in his An&s;wer to me.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, I am at a lo&s;s how to account for the Modera|tor's Conduct, upon Suppo&s;ition that he refu&s;ed to <HI>&s;ub&s;cribe it for him&s;elf per&s;onally,</HI> who has been mo&s;t famous of any in the&s;e Parts for a &s;teady Oppo&s;er of the very Di&s;orders and Er|rors mentioned in the Te&s;timony; I ob&s;erve this very much to
<PB N="11" REF="005202_0010_1016E348310FB528">his Honour, for by differencing between the Good and Evil, he, together with many others, have approved them&s;elves true Friends to the Work of GOD.</P>
<P>But from all I can find after diligent Enquiry into this Mat|ter, it is far otherwi&s;e; the Moderator, as his con&s;tant Prac|tice has all along been, only expre&s;&s;ed his De&s;ire, that the Mem|bers that voted the <HI>Te&s;timony</HI> &s;hould &s;ub&s;cribe it with him, but it was voted that the Moderator &s;hould &s;ign it alone; this I be|lieve is the Truth of the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>As to the other Fact about polling upon the la&s;t Paragraph of the Te&s;timony, I will freely declare al&s;o what appears to me to be the whole Truth, viz, I believe the Moderator did count the Votes as you a&s;&s;ert. But it was done &s;ometime after the Vote upon the la&s;t Article was pa&s;&s;ed, and after diver&s;e Mem|bers were gone off, &s;uppo&s;ing the Votes to have been now fini&s;h|ed. This is what &s;everal Members of that Convention who vot|ed the Te&s;timony, have told me for their Parts, and which I'm told, was the Ca&s;e of &s;everal others who moved from the Con|vention.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, diver&s;e Gentlemen who never voted at all, in pa&s;&s;|ing any of tho&s;e Articles (&s;ome out of Principle, others ap|prehending they had no Right to vote) were counted on the Negative without any Di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>I'll di&s;mi&s;s this Point with one Remark more, viz. That every one of the Articles in the <HI>printed Te&s;timony</HI> relating to <HI>Errors</HI> and <HI>Di&s;orders</HI> were voted in the Affirmative by a very great Majority.</P>
<P><HI>Rev. Sir,</HI> you would not have it thought <Q>that the <HI>Committee,</HI> cho&s;en to draw up a Report on this Occa&s;ion, were all of them &s;hutting out an Atte&s;tation to the late Work of God's holy Spirit among us.</Q></P>
<P>In An&s;wer to this I &s;hall only remark two Things.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>(1) That the Character of every one of that <HI>Rev. Commit|tee</HI> is &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed, as not to admit of the lea&s;t Doubt that they are Friends to the Work of GOD's Grace, and are always ready to &s;et to their Seal to the Truth: Neither can I begin to think in my Heart, that we were <HI>in Perils by fal&s;e Brethren</HI> at that Time, or that there is any Rea&s;on to cry out a <HI>Confederacy,</HI> a <HI>Confederacy</HI> again&s;t the Work of GOD.</ITEM>

(2) If any of that <HI>Rev. Committee</HI> were di&s;&s;atisfied at the Report, it would have been but fair and friendly in them to have made their Remon&s;trance in Pre&s;ence of the <HI>Committee,</HI> before it was brought into public; which I've been informed was not the Ca&s;e.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><HI>Rev. Sir,</HI> you then complain of it as <HI>undeniable Fact, (P. 3)</HI> <Q>That when Pa&s;tors of an e&s;tabli&s;hed Character as Friends to the Cau&s;e of Truth and Holine&s;s, would have te&s;tified what they tho't concerning the late Revival of Religion in various Parts of the Land, they were interrupted in a rude Manner and treated with open Contempt.</Q> <HI>You go on to &s;ay</HI> <Q>is it not true in Fact, that many earne&s;t Pleas for their being heard were &s;tifled in Clamour and Oppo&s;ition?</Q></P>
<P><HI>Rev. Brother,</HI> If &s;uch an A&s;&s;embly had indeed treated one another with &s;o much Rudene&s;s, Contempt and Clamour, would it not have been much more becoming your Character, in&s;tead of expo&s;ing their Nakedne&s;s, to have &s;ilently covered it with a Mantle of Charity? That <HI>Charity which covereth a Multi|tude of Sins.</HI></P>
<P>But really Sir, I am not &s;en&s;ible that the Charge is ju&s;t: I know there was too much intemperate Heat and Pa&s;&s;ion expre&s;|&s;ed by Gentlemen on both Sides of the Que&s;tion; and to the be&s;t of my Ob&s;ervation, full as much on one Side as t'other, where|by it was evident, that we are all <HI>Men of like Pa&s;&s;ions!</HI> Nay, you are the only Per&s;on, I ever heard &s;peak of the Behaviour of that Rev Gentleman you refer to (in the Margin) in the &s;oft Language of a <HI>ju&s;t Warmth of Re&s;entment,</HI> te&s;tifying again&s;t <Q>the bad Spirit that appear'd to prevail in the A&s;&s;embly, and the ill Treatment given to Pa&s;tors, who only de&s;ir'd a pa|tient hearing, while they &s;pake in Favour of the late Work of GOD's Grace.</Q></P>
<P>But, Sir, Pa&s;tors had Liberty of Speech there in the Cau&s;e of GOD; and to the be&s;t of my Remembrance were generally treated with Re&s;pect and Decency.</P>
<P>Its true, you was oppo&s;ed &s;peaking in tat Convention, 'till you would be brought to &s;ay at lea&s;t, that you &s;pake as a Mem|ber of it, which you refu&s;ing to do, your Atte&s;tation was not received, and its generally thought, that Ju&s;tice was done you.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="005202_0012_1016E349C2A71B90">
I mu&s;t remark here, that &s;everal worthy Gentlemen on your Side of the Que&s;tion did not &s;eem at that Time to be in the Ex|erci&s;e of that <HI>Wi&s;dom, which is ea&s;y to be entreated.</HI> For after &s;everal Conce&s;&s;ions were made on &s;ome Articles in the Report at their De&s;ire, it was publickly ob&s;erved, that they did not vote one &s;ingle Article in the printed Te&s;timony: For which extra|ordinary Conduct you profe&s;s to give a Rea&s;on (in P. 12, 13) which po&s;&s;ibly may be found wanting.</P>
<P>You are not ignorant, Sir, that it was &s;aid in the Debate, that the Time would not allow of every Members giving a particu|lar Account of the extraordinary Work in his own Place, which was one Rea&s;on of their not being heard more fully upon that Head, and did not proceed from a <HI>united</HI> Endeavour in the <HI>Pa&s;|tors to &s;hut out an Atte&s;tatiion to the Work of GOD's holy Spirit among us.</HI> And to be plain, there was al&s;o a Jealou&s;y in the Minds of Gentlemen, who appear'd zealous for the Te&s;timony, that the Rev. <HI>Prote&s;ters</HI> &s;pared no Pains to prevent the pa&s;&s;ing and Publication of it.</P>
<P>Rev. Brother, as to your declaring publickly with great Free|dom <Q>that you are one of tho&s;e Mini&s;ters in <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> who, in Concurrence with a Number of Mini&s;ters in the Country, have de&s;ired and propo&s;ed to have an Interview at <HI>Bo&s;ton the Day after the approaching Commencement;</HI></Q> That is in plain Engli&s;h, to have a <HI>&s;eparate Convention,</HI> in order to give <HI>an open conjunct Te&s;timony to the late happy Revival of Religion in many Parts of this Land.</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I firmly believe you heartily concur in this extraordinary Motion, and the rather, becau&s;e it is carrying on the &s;ame De|&s;ign you &s;eem'd to project ever &s;ince you &s;eparated in &s;uch an extraordinary Manner from the Convention above &s;even Years ago, viz. <HI>The holding a &s;eparate Convention:</HI> To prevent which, I am one of tho&s;e Pa&s;tors which told you, dear Brother, at that Time, we would upon our Knees entreat your Continuance a|mong us, but we were unhappily di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>The Projection, if I mi&s;take not, was to begin with &s;e|parating the <HI>united Mini&s;ters</HI> of <HI>Bot&s;ton,</HI> which happily fail'd by the kind Mediation of &s;ome of your Reverend Fathers and Brethren; and perhaps, I my &s;elf was in&s;trumental to
<PB N="14" REF="005202_0013_1016E355B9BDC8B8">reconcile them, though in a mo&s;t &s;ecret, yet not le&s;s &s;in|cere and effectual Manner.</P>
<P>But, Reverend Brother, Why do the Reverend Gentle|men concerned in this Affair, appear &s;o &s;hy of &s;ub&s;cribing this Propo&s;al <HI>(for to do you Ju&s;tice, you are the only Gentle|man who has not acted behind the Curtain, by refu&s;ing a Sub&s;cription to this Account)</HI> and appointing <HI>the Place of Meeting</HI> for the de&s;igned Interview of Pa&s;tors&mdash;both in the common News Letters and your own printed Letter&mdash;but oblige your Fathers and Brethren to <HI>call at the Place of your Abode for Information:</HI> Would it not have been much more fair, open and generous, to have given the mo&s;t publick Notice of the Place of convening, that all your Reverend Fathers and Brethren might come to the Help of the common Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Sir, I have fini&s;hed my Remarks upon your Letter, in which I have &s;incerely aim'd at declaring the whole Truth; and if I am mi&s;taken in any material Point, or have tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ed the Rules of Decency and Charity, I heartily de&s;ire to be forgiven.</P>
<P>And now, dear Brother, &s;uffer me to expo&s;tulate with you on this <HI>melancholy Occa&s;ion.</HI> Why do you &s;trive in this Manner to promote a <HI>&s;eparate Convention?</HI> Will the com|mon Salvation be really promoted by it? Won't the Ef|fects of it be &s;ad and fatal to the true Intere&s;t of Piety? Won't the common Adver&s;ary to Truth and Peace be gra|tified by &s;uch Altercations between the Mini&s;ters of our holy Religion?</P>
<P>I be&s;eech you, let us take Heed of <HI>falling out by the Way. Let there be no Strife between the Mini&s;ters of</HI> CHRIST, <HI>for we are Brethren: Let us love as Brethren, be pitiful and courteous.</HI></P>
<P>In fine, I am fully per&s;waded that the mo&s;t effectual Method, under GOD, to reduce GOD's People to a pro|per Temper of Mind, and the Order of the Go&s;pel, is for the Clergy to &s;hew a reconciling and charitable Spirit, and fir&s;t be reconciled among them&s;elves: then may they with a better Grace and Force addre&s;s the People to con&s;ider
<PB N="15" REF="005202_0014_1016E34B597B7FA0">and reform their Ways. And it is high Time for us all to attempt this; and may the GOD of Peace and Order in all the Churches of his Saints add his Ble&s;&s;ing to our united Prayers and Endeavous to forward and accompli&s;h &s;uch a glorious De&s;ign.</P>
<P>Dear Brother, wi&s;hing you Health and all the Ble&s;&s;ings and Comforts of a &s;ucce&s;sful Mini&s;try, and de&s;iring your Prayers for me, that I may be in Health, and my Soul pro&s;per; and that I may be prepared to give up a good Account of my Steward&s;hip.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am your affectionate Brother, and Servant in the Mini&s;try of the Go&s;pel, John Hancock.</SIGNED>
