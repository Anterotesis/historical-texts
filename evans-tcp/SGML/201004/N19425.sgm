<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>FROM</HI> the time of <HI>Plato</HI> and <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> to the pre&s;ent, the &s;ubject of government has employed the pens of &s;ome of the fir&s;t philo&s;ophers of every age. Much is due to the labors of tho&s;e &s;ages, e&s;pecially to &s;ome of the Moderns. They have taught the world, that the &s;cience of government does not con&s;i&s;t in an a&s;&s;umption of principles, merely arbitrary, or in the reveries of metaphy&s;ics. And yet, I do not know, that any writer, ancient or modern, has attempted to analyze the &s;ocial nature of man, and from the rela|tions, thence re&s;ulting, to derive the principles, which ought to be pur&s;ued in civil in&s;titutions. It will, I believe, however, be readily perceiv'd, that this is the only certain ground of inve&s;tigation, the only mode, in which any general, con&s;i&s;tent, practicable principles in the &s;cience of government can be e&s;tabli&s;hed. This mode of inve&s;tigation has been attempted in the follow|ing &s;ketches. How far I have &s;ucceeded, how far I have been able to di&s;cover any new principles, or more clearly to illu&s;trate &s;uch as had been already di&s;covered, I &s;ubmit to the candor of the public.</P>
<P>I have endeavored at the inve&s;tigation of natural principles, and to pur&s;ue truth wherever it led, unin|fluenced by the weight of authority on the one hand, or a &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition on the other. I have &s;everal times, in the cour&s;e of the following work, been induc|ed to differ from the opinions of &s;ome writers of the fir&s;t abilities and reputation. Though I have exam|ined the&s;e opinions with the freedom of philo&s;ophical di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, I have all along aimed to treat the writers with that decent re&s;pect, which they merit from every lover of &s;cience.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="025297_0005_0FCCF371A459B9A0">The title will adverti&s;e the reader, that he is not to expect in this little work, a &s;y&s;tem compleated and illu&s;trated in all its parts. I have attempted only <HI>SKETCHES</HI> of the <HI>PRINCIPLES</HI> of <HI>GOVERNMENT.</HI> I have cho&s;en this title, as mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive of the limits of the de&s;ign, as well as of the manner of execution.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION I.</HI> The Subject propo&s;ed.</HEAD>
<P>A THEORY has been adopted, by &s;ome European Philo&s;ophers,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and of e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&mdash;The A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> of no &s;mall note, that the fir&s;t rude &s;tate of &s;ociety, which, among civilized nations, is u&s;ually denominated the &s;avage &s;tate, is the only natural &s;tate of man; that, in this &s;tate alone, he is capable of attaining the achme of perfection in virtue and happine&s;s. They have &s;uppo&s;ed, that, what are generally called &s;ocial improvements, &s;erve only to deprave, and either inevitably generate a wicked di&s;|po&s;ition in man, or, at lea&s;t, invigorate an original propen&s;ity to vice, which lay dor|mant, in what they &s;o emphatically &s;tile, the &s;tate of nature. They have further &s;uppo&s;|ed, that from this wicked di&s;po&s;ition, thus be|come predominant, and from various cla&s;h|ing intere&s;ts, unknown in the &s;tate of nature, ari&s;es a war of all again&s;t all; that civil laws and government are an invention of man, to re&s;train the&s;e evils. Hence they derive the nece&s;&s;ity of government, ultimately, from the original or adventitious wickedne&s;s of men.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="025297_0013_0FCCF37F19180E98">Others have e&s;pou&s;ed an opinion, that true virtue, genuine benevolence, in man, would, in every &s;tage of &s;ociety, &s;uper&s;ede the nece&s;&s;ity of municipal laws, and civil &s;ubordination. With the former, they hold, that wickedne&s;s, alone, has impo&s;ed the nece&s;&s;ity of civil governments. Both appear to imagine, that civil polity is not to be derived from the nature of man; but that it is a &s;y&s;tem of rules, contrived to meet his wicked di&s;po&s;ition, and to re&s;train the violence of individuals, by the vio|lence of laws. According to them, it was not &s;o much de&s;igned, by the author of our nature, to lead men to happine&s;s, in &s;ociety, as to prevent the mi&s;ery, which they are ever ready to inflict on each other; in &s;hort, that man has a nece&s;&s;ity for civil government, but not an adaptation of his nature to that &s;tate.</P>
<P>Some political writers, of great eminence, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Locke, Beccaria, and many others.</NOTE> have admitted, that man was originally de&s;igned for civil government, and that he is under a certain nece&s;&s;ity of nature to adopt it. At the &s;ame time, they have maintained, that on entering into civil &s;ociety, he, of nece&s;&s;ity, gives up a certain &s;hare of his natural liberty, of his natural rights. By the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions of natural liberty, and natural rights, are to be under|&s;tood
<PB N="15" REF="025297_0014_0FCCF380B39959C0" MS="y">
that liberty, and tho&s;e rights, to which man is entitled by the laws of his nature, as con&s;tituted by the Author of his being. This implies, that man, by the laws of his nature, is but partially &s;itted for &s;ociety. Impelled, however, to adopt that &s;tate, from a nece&s;&s;ity, which is admitted to ari&s;e from &s;ome part of his nature, he &s;acrifices a part of his natural rights, to &s;ecure the re|mainder, and even to acquire tho&s;e, to which, by the laws of his nature, he was not originally entitled.</P>
<P>I propo&s;e, in the following SKETCHES, to enquire, How far MAN, by the laws of his nature, is fitted for &s;ociety and civil government&mdash;Whether his happine&s;s does not require &s;ocial improvement, and laws, which are the re&s;ult of his whole nature, lead to civil government&mdash;Or whether he is compelled to adopt the latter, by a &s;ingle, and that a vicious principle in his nature, in oppo&s;ition to others&mdash;Whether, con&s;i|dered as a phy&s;ical and moral being, the laws of his nature have indulged him any liberty, which he may not enjoy under civil laws and government.</P>
<P>The principal view in the&s;e enquiries, will be to endeavor to find the leading Principles of Government, in the laws of &s;ocial nature, and to trace them into exer|ci&s;e, in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of civil in&s;titu|tions.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="025297_0015_0FCCF382107F6B50">In the United States of America, political opinions, though con&s;idered as merely theoretical, cannot be wholly incon&s;equen|tial. In the&s;e States, government is, pro|fe&s;&s;edly, founded in the rights of man. It derives all its energy in the prevention of evil, all its efficacy in the production of happine&s;s, from the &s;entiments of the peo|ple. The opinions entertained of govern|ment, of the nece&s;&s;ity of laws, of the end to be attained by them, and the means of attaining that end, will have an influence on the &s;entiments of the people, and the rea&s;onings of the legi&s;lator. They will, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, form the features of the government, and give a complexion to its laws.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION II.</HI> Of the &s;en&s;e in which, Principle, and Prin|ciples of Government, are u&s;ed in the fol|lowing <HI>Sketches.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I proceed to the &s;ubject pro|po&s;ed, I &s;hall take the liberty to premi&s;e a few ob&s;ervations on the u&s;e of the&s;e terms, as they occur frequently in the following work.&mdash;From Monte&s;quieu, the term <HI>principles,</HI> when applied to government, has
<PB N="17" REF="025297_0016_0FCCF3851B511A60">
been u&s;ed in a more appropriate &s;en&s;e, than in other &s;ciences. In other &s;ciences, it always &s;ignifies &s;omething fundamental, &s;ome leading rule, law, or maxim. Thus we &s;peak of the principles, on which any thing is con&s;tructed, as a watch. The term <HI>principles</HI> here, comprehends, not only the laws of mechanics, but tho&s;e rules, by which the relative proportions of the &s;everal parts are determined, to direct the motions to a certain end. The&s;e are properly called the principles of con&s;truction.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o rules, by which the moving force is applied, and made to operate on the machine, with a view to the end pro|po&s;ed. The&s;e we call the principles of operation.</P>
<P>The term is frequently u&s;ed to &s;ignify a mere pa&s;&s;ive power; that power, by which a &s;ubject is fitted to exhibit, in con&s;equence of the operation of particular agents upon it, certain effects, agreeably to certain laws. Thus we &s;peak of the principle of fluidity, the inflamable principle, the principle of malleability; and thus we &s;ay of man, that the principles of &s;ociety and government are implanted in his nature; by which we mean, that he is &s;itted for that &s;tate, or, at lea&s;t, that his nature requires it.</P>
<P>In the &s;cience of government, there are the principles of con&s;truction, by which
<PB N="18" REF="025297_0017_0FCCF38695735D10">
government is con&s;tituted and organized&mdash; the operative principles, by which its acti|vity and efficiency are produced and directed &mdash;the pa&s;&s;ive principles&mdash;or the pa&s;&s;ive powers of man, to which the operative principles are adapted, to produce the end intended, obedience to the laws. The ope|rative and pa&s;&s;ive principles, in any go|vernment, are determined by the con&s;truc|tive principles employed, or the nature of the con&s;titution. They will, therefore, be different, according to the different con&s;ti|tutions of government. The&s;e, which I have called the operative and pa&s;&s;ive prin|ciples, Monte&s;quieu, with a view chiefly to the latter, has, by way of eminence, called the principles of government. He &s;eems to be too fond of &s;implifying, in this in|&s;tance.</P>
<P>The principles of a government are not capable of being perfectly &s;implified, much le&s;s of being reduced to a &s;ingle principle. Far from it, they are often very complex, and &s;ubject to a great variety of modifica|tions, from the admi&s;&s;ion of different, and &s;ometimes oppo&s;ite principles. They re|tain, however, in each kind of government, their general and predominant character|i&s;tics. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of all the principles of government, as well as tho&s;e of Monte&s;quieu. He has defined the prin|ciples
<PB N="19" REF="025297_0018_0FCCF38841A036C8">
of government to be the human pa&s;&s;ions, which &s;et it in motion. It would, perhaps, have been more accurate to have &s;aid, that the human pa&s;&s;ions are the pa&s;&s;ive powers of man, by which he is prepared to be operated upon, and to be put in motion to various ends, and in various modes, ac|cording to the choice, application, and direction of the means, or of the operative principles.</P>
<P>He has introduced three different prin|ciples, which he tells us are peculiar to the three principal forms of government; the De&s;potic, Monarchical, and Republican. Fear, he tells us, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the principle of a de&s;|potic government. This, in his &s;en&s;e of the term, is undoubtedly ju&s;t. The in&s;tru|ments of de&s;poti&s;m, are a military force at the beck of the Sovereign, which, by the terror of puni&s;hments, or rather of venge|ance, &s;ecures obedience to his mandates. Inveterate habits of &s;uper&s;tition, frequently, come in aid of the military force, and clothe the me&s;&s;enger of the Prince with the power of armies.</P>
<P>Fear is that pa&s;&s;ion of human nature, to which the mea&s;ures of this government are, principally, addre&s;&s;ed, and without which the de&s;pot could procured obedience, only by the con&s;tant and pre&s;ent applica|tion of force, in each particular ca&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="025297_0019_0FCCF38D36714180">Honor, he tells us, is the principle of a monarchy. This, taken in his own &s;en&s;e, is very deficient. That pa&s;&s;ion of emu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a|tion, a de&s;ire of excellence, which is natu|ral to man, and which, by cultivation, is capable of an infinity of directions, good and evil, is, with the higher orders in monarchy, modified into what is called the principle of honor. But its direct effect in &s;ecuring obedience to the &s;overeign, is confined, principally, to tho&s;e orders. The multitude are under a complicated de&s;pot|i&s;m. The nobles, in conjunction with the military order, are the in&s;truments em|ployed to awe the people to obedience. Religion, transformed into a gloomy &s;uper|&s;tition, is, u&s;ually, employed to the &s;ame end.</P>
<P>The principle of a Republic, or rather a Democratic Republic, he calls virtue.&mdash; We are liable to be mi&s;&s;ed by the u&s;e of this term, in a &s;en&s;e &s;o different from that, in which it is commonly received. He defines it to be a mere &s;en&s;ation, a faculty of the mind, a love of the laws and our country. In analogy to his other princi|ples, I have ventured to call it a &s;entiment of attachment to the community, its con|&s;titution and laws. I will not take upon me to &s;ay, that this is altogether ju&s;t, or that it is &s;ufficiently comprehen&s;ive. It
<PB N="21" REF="025297_0020_0FCCF38E1AFE2FD0">
is, however, ju&s;t to the principal purpo&s;e, for which it is intended. In a democratic republic, the law is, or ought to be, an expre&s;&s;ion of the will of the &s;ociety, being the aggregate of the individual wills. Now, if the will of the aggregate coincide pre|ci&s;ely, in all ca&s;es, with each individual will, an ob&s;ervance of the law mu&s;t be as nece&s;&s;ary as the power of willing. But this, perhaps, can, in no in&s;tance, be the ca&s;e. The will of the whole, that is the law, is the re&s;ult of mutual conce&s;&s;ions, a com|promi&s;e of the individual wills. Hence a nece&s;&s;ity, not only of a general approbation of the re&s;ult, but an attachment to the ge|neral good of the community, as con&s;titut|ed under government and laws, to &s;ecure the obedience of each individual member. In this kind of government, no force can be applied, in the execution of the laws, but what depends on this principle. It cer|tainly is no more entitled to be called vir|tue, than any of the &s;ocial pa&s;&s;ions common to man; but it has this preeminence over the other principles mentioned above, that it is, when rightly informed, perfectly in harmony with all the moral and &s;ocial vir|tues, and is be&s;t promoted by them.</P>

<P>THAT the &s;avage &s;tate is a &s;tate of na|ture to man, cannot, with truth, be denied. There is not, at this day, a people on earth, who may not trace their origin to a race of &s;avages; &s;ome, indeed, more, and &s;ome le&s;s rude. The Jews, as the writings of Mo&s;es and their &s;ub&s;equent hi&s;torians prove, are far from being an exception. The que&s;tion is not, whether a rude, un|poli&s;hed &s;tate, be ever a natural &s;tate to man; but whether, in the original con&s;ti|tution of his nature, he is &s;o formed for happine&s;s in this &s;tate, as to exclude any general benefit to be derived from pro|gre&s;&s;ive improvement. We are at a lo&s;s
<PB N="23" REF="025297_0022_0FCCF39266AA4120">
at what period, in the progre&s;s of &s;ociety, to fix the preci&s;e &s;tate of nature which is in|tended. Shall we go back to the rude &s;tate of the inhabitants of New-Holland, who have learnt to draw no part of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from the earth, by cultivation? Or &s;hall we chu&s;e the &s;till more rude &s;tate of the inhabitants of Terra-del-Fugo, who&s;e &s;ole dependence for food is on the &s;hell fi&s;h found in the &s;ands, at the ebb of the tide? Neither of whom have any notion of ho|ne&s;ty, or the rights of property, beyond the circle of their &s;everal tribes.&mdash;Shall we make a little farther advance, and place it among the &s;avages of North-America? They are &s;imple, they are hone&s;t, as far as the circle of their &s;everal tribes. They take their food from the river or the fore&s;t, furni&s;hed by the hand of nature. The little deficiencies are &s;upplied from the cul|tivation of the earth. The &s;kins of the chace furni&s;h them with coar&s;e, but com|fortable clothes, or are exchanged for the product of European looms. They are not goaded by ambition, to attempt the acqui|&s;ition of power, which, when acquired, has generally proved the &s;courge of the human race. They are content, or re&s;igned to the pre&s;ent, and are little anxious about the future. All this is true of the North-American natives, and yet it gives us hard|ly
<PB N="24" REF="025297_0023_0FCCF393C4269B58">
a glimp&s;e of their character. The &s;av|ages of America, like other men, have their predominant pa&s;&s;ions. They e&s;teem war and hunting almo&s;t the only pur&s;uits worthy of a man. Addre&s;s in the&s;e, con|&s;titutes their highe&s;t point of honor. Every other labor of life is relegated to their wo|men, who are little better than &s;laves. Hence they derive an exce&s;&s;ive ferocity of manners. Their re&s;entment is keen, and revenge their mo&s;t darling gratification. This ari&s;es from their &s;tate of &s;ociety, in which every man is left to judge in his own cau&s;e, and to avenge his own wrongs. As they never forget a favor, &s;o they never forgive an injury.</P>
<P>Among their different tribes, the injuries of an individual are re&s;ented as national. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a hunting ground is, to them, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an empire. The&s;e are &s;ources of frequent wars, waged with the mo&s;t &s;avage ferocity. The butchering and &s;calping of old men, women, and chil|dren, the torturing and burning of pri&s;on|ers, in cold blood, with the mo&s;t &s;hocking circum&s;tances of cruelty, are among their pa&s;times. The&s;e are not &s;ecret acts of vi|olence. They are by none con&s;idered as wrong. They are public tran&s;actions, per|formed, under what is, to them, the law of nations.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="025297_0024_0FCCF394D281A7D8">As they are not anxious about the future, they are, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, almo&s;t wholly improvident. When not engaged in their favorite pur&s;uits of war, or hunting, they are too indolent to think of making an adequate provi&s;ion again&s;t the inclemency of the &s;ea&s;on, or, indeed, again&s;t any future want. As they have fewer vices, &s;o they have fewer virtues than more civilized na|tions; and both are more prominent, more di&s;tinctly marked. This ari&s;es from the paucity of the objects, with which they are conver&s;ant. With them, numerous pa&s;&s;ions, correcting and re&s;training each other, are not, as in a &s;tate of civilization, equally excited by a multiplicity of objects. When any object rou&s;es their attention, the whole force of the mind, the whole vigor of the &s;oul, is collected, and exerted upon one point.</P>
<P>Ho&s;pitality is a virtue, almo&s;t peculiar to a &s;avage people, and the &s;ine&s;t trait in their character. When we contemplate this virtue, among &s;uch a people, it &s;trikes the mind with all the advantage of vivid &s;entiment, &s;ingularity of impre&s;&s;ion, and contra&s;t of manners. Every recollection is accompanied with an enthu&s;ia&s;tic admira|tion, that makes us regret the lo&s;s of tho&s;e manners, which were alone capable of this &s;ublime virtue. Will it &s;till be
<PB N="26" REF="025297_0025_0FCCF39665080E88">
thought &s;trange to a&s;&s;ert, that this virtue derives its origin, and takes its principal lu&s;tre from the barbarous manners of the age? And yet &s;o is the fact. It does not, however, con&s;i&s;t with the rude&s;t &s;tate of &s;ociety and of manners. Some advance in civilization, &s;ome progre&s;s in the arts of life, is nece&s;&s;ary to give a reli&s;h for ho&s;|pitality, and to &s;upply the means of in|dulging it. Among a people in the hunter &s;tate, it makes but little figure. Depend|ing upon the fortune of the cha&s;e, or the gleanings of the fore&s;t, they find but a &s;canty, and precarious &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. With neither the fore&s;ight, nor the means, of making a &s;ecure provi&s;ion for the future, they are frequently in want of nece&s;&s;ary &s;u&s;tenance. Among &s;uch a people, the pre&s;&s;ing demands of nature leave little of their &s;canty &s;tores for the u&s;es of ho&s;pitality. They have little curio&s;ity, and no con|ception of any knowlege, which can be of u&s;e, beyond that of forming the bow, or &s;ome in&s;trument of the chace. In this &s;ituation, what can, with them, compen&s;ate for an additional tax upon their already half fami&s;hed appetites? The North-American natives have never been equally noted for the practice of this virtue, with the ancient Germans, or the more ancient inhabitants of Greece. They draw but a
<PB N="27" REF="025297_0026_0FCCF3984732DD70">
&s;mall &s;hare of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from the earth. All the care of their tillage, con|&s;i&s;ting in that of maize, beans, and &s;ome few edible roots, is left to the women. The labor of the&s;e, &s;pared from their at|tendance on the men in the chace, and other drudgeries of a dome&s;tic nature, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of dome&s;tic animals, and with &s;uch rude implements as they can either form or procure, mu&s;t yield a very &s;canty &s;upply, for one part of the year; the other is, for the mo&s;t part, as &s;cantily &s;upplied, by the fortune of the chace. They appear to have little reli&s;h for any new arts of life, unle&s;s they have &s;ome relation to their principal occupations of war and hunting; and very little curio&s;ity for any information to be derived from an intercour&s;e with &s;trangers. In&s;tances, however, are not wanting, in which they have di&s;covered all that fidelity to their gue&s;ts, all that warmth of attachment, which gives &s;uch a charm to the patriarchal times. Although the in&s;tances are le&s;s frequent, they bear the &s;ame genuine character of heroic integrity.</P>

objects afford gratification to an awakened curio&s;ity. Still they are generally divided into &s;mall tribes. Their dome&s;tic manners are &s;incere, but rough. To foreigne&s;s they are fierce, cruel, and faithle&s;s. So univer&s;al is the &s;tate of war among &s;uch a people, that in almo&s;t every language, the &s;ame word, originally, &s;ignified both foreign|er and enemy. Di&s;puted boundaries are often the occa&s;ion of wars. They are often waged to avenge a private quarrel. To &s;urpri&s;e and plunder the neighboring tribes of their herds, is the principal object of their ho&s;tile enterpri&s;es. Their whole hi&s;tory is a continued &s;cene of war, pillage, and repri&s;al. So frequent were the&s;e pre|datory expeditions among the petty tribes of ancient Greece, that they were early honored with a particular appellation. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">. <HI>Abactio bovum.

Inns for the

accommodation of travellers are unknown. Were it not for the ho&s;pitality of indivi|duals, there could be no pa&s;&s;ing from one country to another. There is &s;omething in the practice very congenial to the frank, rough, and generous manners of a rude people. Their genero&s;ity, however, in this favorite in&s;tance, ri&s;es, as it were, through a cloud. We find by Homer, that &s;trang|ers, u&s;ually, applied to their intended ho&s;ts, in the po&s;ture of &s;uppliants, and intreated the rights of ho&s;pitality, as for their lives. His in&s;tances may, indeed, be con&s;idered as poetic fictions; but they were, undoubt|edly, relative to the manner of the age. To grant the rights of ho&s;pitality, was, to grant protection. The ho&s;t, or patron, was con&s;idered as the protector of his gue&s;t. This office &s;uited with a martial &s;pirit. It gave the ho&s;t con&s;equence in his own e&s;ti|mation, and in the e&s;timation of others. The practice of this virtue, among rude nations, affords not only a gratification to curio&s;ity, but an opportunity of indulging in the exerci&s;e of humanity to a &s;tranger, without incuring the imputation of a want of attachment to the tribe. The advanta|ges are national and reciprocal. In no other way can they acquire a knowlege of foreign nations, their arts and manners. Like the &s;afety of heralds, it pa&s;&s;es into
<PB N="30" REF="025297_0029_0FCCF39E5D4944C8">
their law of nations. In ancient writers, we frequently read of the rights of ho&s;pi|tality, of the laws of ho&s;pitality, and of wars to avenge the violations of tho&s;e rights. Indeed, it is rather to be con&s;idered as a national, than a private virtue. In the pre&s;ent &s;tate of improvement, among civilized nations, almo&s;t every rea&s;on, which concurred, among &s;avages, to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of ho&s;pitality, has cea&s;ed, and the practice has cea&s;ed of cour&s;e. The arts of writing and printing have furni&s;hed almo&s;t innumerable vehicles of intelli|gence, always at command. Knowlege of all the arts of life is diffu&s;ed, with facility, &s;afety, and accuracy, as far as the u&s;e of letters is known. The cultivation of the gentle pa&s;&s;ions, an improved &s;en&s;e of the duties of humanity, a knowlege of its rights, and the protection afforded to tho&s;e rights by the law of nations, and by the civil laws of mo&s;t countries, have &s;uper&s;eded the nece&s;&s;ity of individual protection. Public accommodations have become much more convenient for travellers, than private ho&s;pitality. The univer&s;al intro|duction and currency of money, has given men the command of a kind of property, which may, with ea&s;e and &s;afety, attend their per&s;ons, and provide for them, in all their peregrinations.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="025297_0030_0FCCF3A042B8EA28">Mo&s;t men who travel, at this day, are en|gaged in pur&s;uits of intere&s;t, or gratifications of a private nature. In this &s;tate of things, ho&s;pitality, in the ancient practice, would be unnece&s;&s;ary, unju&s;t, and intolerably burden&s;ome. And why &s;hould we regret its lo&s;s? Let tho&s;e who entertain &s;uch an enthu&s;ia&s;tic veneration for ho&s;pitality, and other ancient virtues of the &s;ame origin, reflect, that they cannot have the effect without the cau&s;e; and that tho&s;e precious gems of &s;avage virtue would lo&s;e their lu&s;tre and e&s;timation, without the foil of &s;avage vices.</P>
<P>This &s;hort &s;ketch is &s;ufficient to prove, that the fir&s;t rude &s;tate of man, or, if we chu&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion, the fir&s;t &s;imple &s;tate of &s;ociety, does not mo&s;t abound in virtue and happine&s;s. I have given, indeed, a &s;hort, but, I believe, a true &s;ketch of every equally uncivilized tribe on earth. Shall I be forgiven the cen&s;ure, if I &s;ay, this opinion of a preference of the &s;avage to a civilized &s;tate of &s;ociety, has been propa|gated, by the glowing pens of &s;ome writ|ers, who&s;e love of virtue exceeded their information? Had they attended to the &s;cience of human nature, the developement of the human mind, the powers, faculties, pa&s;&s;ions, and appetites of man; had they &s;tudied, attentively, the hi&s;tory, not of battles
<PB N="32" REF="025297_0031_0FCCF3A25C9EB8A0">
and &s;ieges only, the intrigues of &s;tate&s;men, and the revolutions of empires; but the hi&s;tory of man in &s;ociety, the natural hi&s;tory of the human mind, they would have found rea&s;on for correcting their opinion.</P>
<P>This &s;cience, &s;o important to man, has, till very lately, been hardly attempted by any writer. In the fir&s;t ages of &s;ociety, none are capable of making or recording proper ob&s;ervations. One half of the pro|gre&s;s has, generally, pa&s;&s;ed unnoticed. In following ages, hi&s;torians, hurried away by the more &s;plendid events of hi&s;tory, have mo&s;tly neglected tho&s;e facts, which &s;erve to mark the progre&s;&s;ive improvement of the mind; and readers have been, equally, inattentive to the few, which have been recorded. In America, the be&s;t opportu|nity, which ever pre&s;ented, for &s;upplying the&s;e deficiencies, by ob&s;ervations on real life and manners, has been &s;uffered to e&s;|cape, with very little improvement.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION II.</HI> Of the appetite for &s;ociety&mdash;The hoarding appetite&mdash;The appetite which leads to the propagation of the &s;pecies&mdash;Ambition&mdash; Sympathy.</HEAD>
<P>WE will now briefly enquire, how far man, without any con&s;ideration of mu|tual wants, or a nece&s;&s;ity of mutual de|fence, ari&s;ing from a &s;en&s;e of weakne&s;s, or wickedne&s;s, is fitted for &s;ociety. That &s;urely is his natural &s;tate, to which the laws of his nature, general and particular, all tend. Here let me premi&s;e, that with man, a &s;tate of improvement is not oppo&s;ed to a &s;tate of nature. Perhaps as good a definition as any, which has been given of man, in this view, is, that he is a being capable of improvement, in a progre&s;&s;ion, of which he knows not the limits. Deity has implanted, in his nature, the &s;eeds of improvement, furni&s;hed him with powers and faculties for the cultivation, and to the&s;e, &s;uperadded a &s;en&s;e, that the cultivation is a duty.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing which &s;trikes the mind, in the cour&s;e of our enquiry, is an appetite for &s;ociety. Man de&s;ires to a&s;&s;ociate with man, and feels a plea&s;ure at the approach of his kind. The appetite is &s;o univer&s;ally
<PB N="34" REF="025297_0033_0FCCF3A6DD65E4E8">
prevalent, that it can not well be denied to be the work of nature. The &s;ame appetite, under the name of in&s;tinct, produces all tho&s;e a&s;&s;ociations, which are found to pre|vail among all gregarious animals of the brute creation. With them, it is allowed to be natural. Why not allow it to be &s;o with man, to whom it is &s;o much more exten&s;ively nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful?</P>
<P>It has been made a que&s;tion, whether the &s;ocial appetite be limited, in the number of its objects? I think this que&s;tion will admit, though not of a preci&s;e, yet of a &s;a|tisfactory an&s;wer. It is adapted to the oc|ca&s;ions, the powers and faculties of man, and admits of an equal extention by im|provement: Accordingly, in the early and unimproved &s;tages of &s;ociety, while the powers and faculties of the human mind were in their infancy, we have every where &s;een men a&s;&s;ociating in &s;mall, independent tribes. If at any time, larger a&s;&s;ociations have been formed, in that &s;tate, like &s;ome of the great empires of antiquity, they were not the effect of choice, but of &s;upe|rior force. Agreeably to this opinion, we find, that the parts were very loo&s;ely con|nected, and every where crumbled in piec|es, as &s;oon as that force was removed.</P>
<P>As mankind increa&s;e in knowlege, as their powers and faculties are extended,
<PB N="35" REF="025297_0034_0FCCF3A85BE18708">
and the comprehen&s;ion of the mind en|larged, they, voluntarily, extend their a&s;&s;o|ciations. To determine, therefore, the limits of the &s;ocial appetite, we mu&s;t de|termine the limits of &s;ocial improvements.</P>
<P>This appetite is accompanied with other appetites, with pa&s;&s;ions and in&s;tincts, which have no u&s;e, no gratification, no object, but in &s;ociety. Hardly can we find one, which terminates wholly in &s;elf, not one, which &s;tands oppo&s;ed to &s;ociety. Of com|pa&s;&s;ion, &s;ympathy, and all the train of be|nevolent pa&s;&s;ions and emotions, &s;ociety is, clearly, the ultimate object. Others tend to the pre&s;ervation of the &s;pecies, or of the individuals. Such is the hoarding appe|tite, and the pa&s;&s;ion for riches, to which it gives ri&s;e; the appetite, which leads to the propagation of the &s;pecies, and its con&s;e|quent pa&s;&s;ions&mdash;even the&s;e are not &s;olitary. They do not terminate, wholly, in &s;elf.&mdash; No, not the hoarding appetite, which, if any, might be thought an exception. Here &s;elf often predominates; but in general, the pa&s;&s;ion for riches, &s;tript of every view to &s;ociety, becomes very faint, if not totally extinct.</P>
<P>The man who is intent upon gain, has &s;ome connection, &s;ome friend, whom he wi&s;hes to benefit by his acqui&s;itions. He views the acqui&s;ition of riches as a mean,
<PB N="36" REF="025297_0035_0FCCF3A9D44846A8">
not an end; a mean of future &s;upport and per&s;onal indulgence, it is true; but, at the &s;ame time, a mean of benefiting &s;ome, and of acquiring e&s;teem, confidence, and influence among all. Some in&s;tances have indeed been known of &s;olitary mi&s;ers, who have made the ama&s;&s;ing of riches the &s;ole end of their pur&s;uits. Some indivi|duals have, likewi&s;e, conceived an aver&s;ion to man, and have &s;ecluded them&s;elves from &s;ociety. The&s;e are con&s;idered as deviat|ing from the common &s;en&s;e of their &s;pecies, the common &s;tandard of man. They are in&s;tances of the abu&s;e of natural pa&s;&s;ions; or they are anomalies of the race. There are other anomalies; but from &s;uch we do not take the common nature of man.</P>
<P>The appetite, which leads to the propa|gation of the &s;pecies, is, perhaps, in its origin, a vague, indeterminate impul&s;e to gratification. The principal end of this appetite, doubtle&s;s, is the continuation of the &s;pecies, by a perpetual re-production. In this view it is the con&s;tant revivifying principle of &s;ociety; but the author of our being, who&s;e all-comprehen&s;ive plan is adju&s;ted, in the mo&s;t perfect harmony, has made it further &s;ub&s;ervient to the purpo&s;es of &s;ocial happine&s;s. Nature, by making it the &s;ource of a &s;pecific pa&s;&s;ion, accom|panied with &s;entiments of delicacy and tender|ne&s;s,
<PB N="37" REF="025297_0036_0FCCF3ABAB57F280">
corrects the vaguene&s;s of the appetite. This forms one of the &s;tronge&s;t bonds of &s;ociety, and gives the mo&s;t enchanting &s;oftne&s;s to the <HI>tout en&s;emble.</HI></P>
<P>Ambition, when in balance with other pa&s;&s;ions and appetites, is far from being oppo&s;ed to &s;ociety. Far from being detri|mental, it is highly u&s;eful to man. By this pa&s;&s;ion, many actions, the noble&s;t and mo&s;t beneficial to &s;ociety, are produced. It is only in the extreme, that the pa&s;&s;ion becomes hurtful; when the acqui&s;ition of power or influence is no longer con&s;idered as a mean of doing good; when the pa&s;&s;ion aims, &s;olely, or principally at its own gra|tification. But this is doing violence to the laws of nature, which re&s;ult from the whole nature of man. It is a &s;acrifice of one part of his nature to another.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ions of hatred, revenge, and &s;ome other pa&s;&s;ions, and emotions, the effects of which, are, not unfrequently, very pernicious in &s;ociety, will be re&s;erved for another &s;ection. In the remainder of this &s;ection, we will attend to &s;ome emotions, purely of a &s;ocial tendency.</P>
<P>Sympathy is an ingredient in the &s;ocial nature of man, de&s;erving of very particular attention. The <HI>modus agendi,</HI> or how the emotion of &s;ympathy is produced; whether it be wholly mental; the reflection of a
<PB N="38" REF="025297_0037_0FCCF3AE67EE36B8">
&s;entiment; or whether it be partly organ|ical, partly mental, is, perhaps, one of the &s;ecrets of nature; but the effect is evident, and the final cau&s;e illu&s;trious. It is one of tho&s;e nice adju&s;tments in the nature of man, which give us the mo&s;t exalted idea of the wi&s;dom and benevolence of its author. In the &s;maller circles of life, its influence is more immediate, more direct; but its influence extends to whole nations and empires.&mdash; Sympathy is produced thro' the medium of an organic impre&s;&s;ion. We perceive &s;ome|thing in the countenance, the movement, the whole figure of the per&s;on, which we take for the expre&s;&s;ion of a &s;entiment, or a particular &s;tate of mind in that per&s;on. We in&s;tantaneou&s;ly, &s;eemingly by a direct im|pre&s;&s;ion, without time for reflection, find excited in our&s;elves a corre&s;ponding tone of mind, corre&s;ponding &s;entiments, producing &s;imilar expre&s;&s;ions. The emotion, though we have a &s;en&s;e of pain and di&s;tre&s;s in the object, is not repul&s;ive. On the contrary, we feel a powerful attraction to objects of di&s;tre&s;s. Thus man is &s;weetly prepared, by nature, to mourn with tho&s;e who mourn, and rejoice with tho&s;e who rejoice. The emotion of &s;ympathy, not only prevents a thou&s;and di&s;cords, but produces, in &s;ociety, a kind of in&s;tinctive harmony.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="025297_0038_0FCCF3B0B43887C0">There is another impre&s;&s;ion of &s;ympathy, which &s;eems to be mo&s;tly organic, or an effect on the nerves only. One per&s;on yawning in company, will produce a &s;pon|taneous yawn in all pre&s;ent, at lea&s;t, in all who &s;ee him in the act. When we &s;ee a per&s;on &s;uddenly hurt, or hear of one being wounded in any particular part, or of the amputation of a limb, we feel a particular affection of the nerves in that part, which thence thrills through the whole frame, conveying, at once, to the heart, a &s;en&s;e of the pains &s;uppo&s;ed to be endured by the patient. This may be a rea&s;on, why when we hear of a per&s;on being wounded, we are anxious to learn the manner, and par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i|cular place of the wound. While our information is general, the affection is gene|ral. We endure &s;omething like a &s;tate of &s;u&s;pen&s;e. This is a &s;itation of, apparently, greater unea&s;ine&s;s, than when the &s;en&s;ation is reduced to the corre&s;ponding part.</P>
<P>Lord Kaims has beautifully unfolded the &s;ympathetic emotion of virtue, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Elements of Critici&s;m, v. 1. ch. ii. p. 1. &s;ec. 4.</NOTE> but it ought not to be omitted here. When we are witne&s;&s;es, or hear of the performance of any great, noble, and benevolent action, we find, excited in our&s;elves, a &s;trong di&s;|po&s;ition to perform the &s;ame kind of action. The mind &s;wells with an ardent de&s;ire to
<PB N="40" REF="025297_0039_0FCCF3B22BD1BE30">
find a proper opportunity, or a proper ob|ject.</P>
<P>The&s;e emotions of &s;ympathy, are not the effect of rea&s;oning: they rather re&s;em|ble in&s;tinctive impul&s;es. Sympathy, with|out the intervention of words, blends the thoughts, the &s;entiments, and even the virtuous di&s;po&s;ition of individuals. It dif|fu&s;es joys of the heart, from countenance to countenance, commands relief in di&s;|tre&s;s, and con&s;olation in affliction. Mon|te&s;quieu alludes to this principle in human nature, when he ob&s;erves, that, "people are, generally, able to communicate their ideas to their children; but they are &s;till better able to tran&s;mit their pa&s;&s;ions." This di&s;po&s;ition to &s;ympathy well accounts for all that &s;imilarity of &s;entiments, charac|ter, and even of features, which is ob&s;erva|ble in families, &s;ocieties, and nations; the le&s;s perfect, indeed, the more exten&s;ive the connection.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION III.</HI> Of Hatred and Revenge&mdash;Of Envy, Malice, and &s;ome other di&s;&s;ocial Pa&s;&s;ions.</HEAD>
<P>THE pa&s;&s;ions of Hatred and Revenge, are not, in their nature, oppo&s;ed to &s;ociety, though, from abu&s;e, they become, at times, very pernicious. On a candid enquiry, it will be found, that tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions do not ari&s;e from any malignity in the nature of man. They are given for wi&s;e and good purpo&s;es. They are nece&s;&s;ary to a being capable of right and wrong in his actions; capable of injuring as well as benefiting others, and liable to be, him&s;elf, the &s;ubject of injuries from tho&s;e of his own &s;pecies.</P>
<P>Men are intuitively con&s;cious of a free|dom of action, of a choice in what they do. We know, at the &s;ame time, that man is not a perfect being. He has many weak|ne&s;&s;es. There fall in his way motives to action infinitely various. Sometimes his choice is influenced by ignorance, by error, by the prevalence of particular pa&s;&s;ions, or appetites, a pre&s;ent de&s;ire of gratification. Sometimes, he is confounded with an intri|cate combination of circum&s;tances, the re|&s;ult of which, he wants the power, or the patience to evolve. He is frequently tempted to a deviation from ju&s;tice, by an
<PB N="42" REF="025297_0041_0FCCF3B827DD42E0">
oppo&s;ition of intere&s;ts, originating, not in a direct intention of the parties, but the want of an early fore&s;ight in each of the other's intended pur&s;uits. To a being thus circum&s;tanced, powerful moral re&s;traints are nece&s;&s;ary. Such re&s;traints are provided for man, which come in aid of the moral &s;en&s;e, and are made to ari&s;e from the con|&s;equence of his actions. It is evidently a con&s;titution of Providence, that <HI>vice</HI> &s;hall produce <HI>mi&s;ery,</HI> to the agent, and that <HI>virtue</HI> &s;hall produce <HI>happine&s;s,</HI> as a con&s;e|quence, connected in both, by the relation of cau&s;e and effect. The pa&s;&s;ions of hatred and revenge will be found to accord with this con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The more fully to inve&s;tigate this &s;ubject, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to take a nearer view of human nature. Man, in an unimproved &s;tate, is very little acquainted with the ope|rations of his own mind, the extent of his powers and faculties, and the re&s;ult of their various combinations. For their develope|ment, he is furni&s;hed with &s;en&s;es, internal and external, accompanied with the powers of rea&s;on and inve&s;tigation. It is here, as in phy&s;ics, no reliance can be had on rea|&s;onings, <HI>a priori.</HI> Experience alone can decide. Man, therefore, fully to di&s;cover the direction and extent of his powers and faculties, and the right tendency of his
<PB N="43" REF="025297_0042_0FCCF3B9A3E32DF8">
whole nature, mu&s;t, with &s;ufficient atten|tion and pre&s;ence of mind, to mark the re&s;ult, pa&s;s through &s;uch a variety of &s;itu|ations, as will bring all into exerci&s;e, and put all to the te&s;t, in every variety of com|bination. It is a matter of great difficulty, to make ju&s;t and accurate ob&s;ervations on a &s;ubject, &s;o evane&s;cent, as are the opera|tions of the mind, and always <HI>in tran&s;itu.</HI> They are pa&s;t, ere there is time for reflec|tion. On the mo&s;t important occa&s;ions, the whole mind is wrapped in attention to &s;ome external object. Add to this, &s;ub|jected as man is, though for wi&s;e purpo&s;es, to the influence of habit, his ob&s;ervations will be, frequently, partial, and his con|clu&s;ions warped by &s;ome pre&s;ent prevailing bias. It is evident, therefore, that, farther than the direct perception of the moral &s;en&s;e, in its mo&s;t &s;imple &s;tate, the progre&s;s of knowlege, in moral and &s;ocial combin|ations, will be &s;low; how &s;low, a &s;light attention to the hi&s;tory of the human mind, will evince. We are taught, by rea&s;on and experience, that the le&s;s man is able to di&s;cern agreements and tendencies, the more liable he is to do wrong; the more liable, from partial views, in&s;tead of &s;eeking a compromi&s;e, to &s;acrifice to his own, the intere&s;t of others; at the &s;ame time he is le&s;s able to devi&s;e and enforce tho&s;e &s;ocial rules, which might remedy the evil.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="025297_0043_0FCCF3BB1BF5DA28">In the fir&s;t rude &s;tages of &s;ociety, men have no idea of general rules, or public puni&s;hments, for the prevention of private injuries. They are unable to connect pri|vate injuries with the common concerns of the nation. The redre&s;s and prevention of the&s;e, are left to the care of each indi|vidual. In a &s;ituation like this, hatred and revenge are the only po&s;&s;ible external checks. The&s;e pa&s;&s;ions go to the nature of each individual. Hatred is a rooted aver|&s;ion of one man to another, on account of a real, or &s;uppo&s;ed, fixed and intentional oppo&s;ition to his intere&s;t, or happine&s;s. Revenge, is a de&s;ire in one per&s;on, to inflict an evil on another, for a real, or &s;uppo&s;ed injury received. Hatred dictates the avoid|ance of its object, as di&s;agreeable or nox|ious. Revenge pur&s;ues its object, and is gratified, only with retaliating the injury. Such conduct is dictated by the law of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, and is the more nece&s;&s;ary, as there is no other external re&s;traint, no other mean of e&s;caping, or preventing fu|ture injuries. Thus limited and directed, they are both nece&s;&s;ary for the prevention of a licentiou&s;ne&s;s in injuries, unre&s;trained by any fear of the con&s;equences.</P>
<P>In the progre&s;s of improvement, an ex|ten&s;ion of &s;ocial intercour&s;e, the invention of arts, the change of manners, the &s;epara|tion

of property, the multiplication of de&s;ires, and objects of gratification, form a &s;cene too intricate, a combination of intere&s;ts too complicated for the former &s;imple mode of &s;ociety. Liability to injuries is increa&s;|ed in proportion. The pa&s;&s;ion of revenge, almo&s;t con&s;tantly in exerci&s;e, would, in this &s;tate, if laid under no re&s;traint, become a mo&s;t cruel &s;courge. Nature is always equal to her occa&s;ions.

Still, the pro|gre&s;s is &s;low. It is long before men can be per&s;uaded to accept only a reparation for injuries, and &s;ubmit to &s;ociety, the &s;ole right of puni&s;hing for prevention, which comes in the place of revenge.</P>
<P>The right to revenge private injuries, in the mo&s;t improved &s;tate of &s;ociety, in the highe&s;t refinement of manners, never wholly cea&s;es. Nor is it demanded.&mdash; There will exi&s;t many little oppo&s;itions,

many little injuries, to which the law can|not de&s;cend, and which, if neglected, be|come the &s;ource of greater violences. The exerci&s;e of hatred and revenge, by the party injured, is &s;till the only re&s;traint, in the&s;e ca&s;es. In a &s;tate of refinement, however, the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions are &s;tript of their violence. An avoidance in company, a look of con|tempt, a &s;ilent glance of indignation, may prove a &s;ufficient re&s;traint to a per&s;on, at all &s;u&s;ceptible of the nicer feelings. In this &s;tate, they are hardly known for the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Still, they are the &s;ame, only cha&s;ti&s;ed and accommodated to a more improved &s;tate of &s;ociety. Before, they acted a primary p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> as &s;overeign in the di&s;tribution of puni&s;hments. Now they act a &s;ubordinate part, coming in aid of the law, in matters of &s;maller moment. They are, indeed, liable to great abu&s;es; and what is exempt from abu&s;e, in the hands of a fallible being? We &s;hould be but ill fitted for &s;ociety, in any &s;tate, without them. In an improved and well regulated &s;ociety, the abu&s;e can never be very exten&s;ive, in its con&s;equences. Let us not ra&s;hly at|tempt to correct the wi&s;dom of Deity. Much better is it for us, that we &s;uffer the abu&s;e of them, than the total extinction.</P>
<P>Envy, malice, and avarice, have been accounted in&s;tances of natural pa&s;&s;ions,
<PB N="47" REF="025297_0046_0FCCF3C111EB5760">
which are di&s;&s;ocial, and tend to prove, that man is little fitted for happine&s;s in &s;ociety. I will not contend about the term, <HI>natural.</HI> It is true, that man is capable of the&s;e pa&s;|&s;ions, and of many other vicious pa&s;&s;ions and habits. A little reflection, however, will di&s;cover, that the&s;e are not original in his nature. They have their origin in the abu&s;e of tho&s;e natural pa&s;&s;ions, which are nece&s;&s;ary to his happine&s;s, both as a &s;ocial being, and as an individual.</P>
<P>Envy is generally &s;aid to be Emulation carried to exce&s;s. This is undoubtedly true; but, in exerci&s;e, it certainly partakes of the pa&s;&s;ion of Revenge. Emulation is a de&s;ire to excel others, in the public e&s;ti|mation. The pa&s;&s;ion is not, directly, ei|ther &s;ocial or di&s;&s;ocial, but is, in its con&s;e|quences, frequently, very beneficial to &s;o|ciety. While a per&s;on &s;trives, by the ac|qui&s;ition of &s;uperior excellence, to de&s;erve a preference, in the public opinion, it may be, emphatically, called the &s;trife of virtue. The happine&s;s of &s;ociety is intere&s;ted in the conte&s;t. When a per&s;on de&s;erts the prime object, the acqui&s;ition of real excel|lence, and &s;trives, by the depre&s;&s;ion of a competitor, to enjoy the public e&s;timation unrivalled, it has degenerated into envy. It is now the conte&s;t of vice. A per&s;on, under the dominion of this pa&s;&s;ion, is prone
<PB N="48" REF="025297_0047_0FCCF3C3DB5A3668">
to exaggerate every little fault, in a com|petitor, and to convert, even his virtuous actions into vices, by attributing them to corrupt motives. Every excellence, in a rival, is viewed, as ho&s;tile; every advance, a per&s;onal injury. To complete the tur|pitude of the pa&s;&s;ion, and fill up the mea&s;ure of vice, the pa&s;&s;ion of revenge is called in to its aid.</P>
<P>Malice is a di&s;po&s;ition to inflict evil on others, without ju&s;t cau&s;e. The di&s;po&s;ition is inflamed into a pa&s;&s;ion, whenever a pro|per object is pre&s;ented. It may be called a perpetual anger. It is equally irrational with that pa&s;&s;ion. Some per&s;ons appear to derive, from their organization, an irrit|ability of mind, which ea&s;ily admits this di&s;po&s;ition. In general, malice prevails mo&s;t among a people of fierce and rough manners, where the common tone of the mind borders upon anger. It is more rare in an improved &s;tate of &s;ociety and manners, and where it is di&s;covered, may, generally, be traced to its &s;ource, in a &s;eries of di&s;ap|pointments, in&s;ults, and hard u&s;age, which have habituated the mind to a &s;tate of irrit|ation. In all the&s;e ca&s;es, it is ea&s;ily per|ceived, that a malicious di&s;po&s;ition, is, ori|ginally, no part of the common nature of man. It is wholly adventitious. It is a vicious habit of mind admitted and con|firmed,
<PB N="49" REF="025297_0048_0FCCF3C5D3E6E4F8">
by a too ea&s;y indulgence of the irritable feelings.</P>
<P>Avarice is the exce&s;s of that pa&s;&s;ion, which accompanies the hoarding appetite, as mentioned, in a former &s;ection; the pa&s;&s;ion, which prompts man to provide for his future nece&s;&s;ity, or conveniences. It is the foundation of all his providence. He could not even &s;ub&s;i&s;t without it. Like other pa&s;&s;ions, it is liable to abu&s;e; to be converted into avarice, and become, indi|rectly, an incentive to the mo&s;t horrid vices.</P>
<P>There are pa&s;&s;ions, which originate in habit. Every habit gives <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e to an at|tendant pa&s;&s;ion, which impels to the indulg|ence of the habit. vicious habits are at|tended with vicious pa&s;&s;ions, many of which have the mo&s;t pernicious con&s;equences in &s;ociety. Such pa&s;&s;ions have no pretence of being natural, or, original in the mind of man. The habits, from which they are derived, are formed in the mind, through the neglect, or abu&s;e of &s;ome natural power, faculty, or propen&s;ity. They may, like every vice, be admitted or excluded, at the election of the mind. They may, there|fore, with exact propriety, be denominated artificial.</P>
<P>That any of the pa&s;&s;ions, faculties, or propen&s;ities of man may be abu&s;ed, proves only, that he is a moral agent, capable, in
<PB N="50" REF="025297_0049_0FCCF3C7469D5C00">
his actions, of chu&s;ing between good and evil; or that he is imperfect, and liable to deception, and &s;ometimes aberrations from virtue, without de&s;igning the con&s;equences. Were it an objection to any pa&s;&s;ion, propen|&s;ity, power, or faculty, that it might be ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d to the injury of mankind, not one would e&s;cape condemnation.

<P>Upon a candid view of the &s;ubject, I think we may fairly conclude, that man is, by the laws of his common nature, as con|&s;tituted by the author of his being, fitted for a &s;tate of &s;ociety, and of &s;ocial im|provements; that his happine&s;s depends on the right u&s;e of his pa&s;&s;ions, appetites, powers, and faculties, agreeably to the laws of &s;ocial nature; that, as a moral being, capable of vicious, as well as virtuous ac|tions, he may deviate from his de&s;tination, violate the laws of his nature, and di&s;turb his own happine&s;s, and the happine&s;s of &s;ociety.</P>

When he perceives his actions to be right, or productive of good, agreeably to the order of his nature, he is con&s;cious of a virtuous approbation; when he per|ceives them to be wrong, he &s;uffers the painful emotion of di&s;approbation. Hence ari&s;es his love of ju&s;tice, veracity, and all the &s;ocial, all the moral virtues. What he is con&s;cious of in him&s;elf, he expects to find in others. This is the foundation of his confidence in the ju&s;tice of others, and his reliance on human te&s;timony. That he &s;ometimes violates tho&s;e virtues, is no proof, that he does not love, and admire them. Ju&s;tice, for in&s;tance, is the re&s;ult of action, of moral action; or rather, it is the re&s;ult
<PB N="53" REF="025297_0052_0FCCF3CD0F575670">
of certain reciprocal relations between the action, the agent, and the object. It is often, therefore, not a little complex. A little more, or le&s;s comprehen&s;ion of the&s;e relations, may, wholly, vary the re&s;ult, as to the moral quality of the action. View|ing things through the medium of preju|dice, or of &s;ome predominant pa&s;&s;ion, or appetite, man is liable to err, as well in the a&s;&s;ociation, as in the application; and while he loves virtue, in general, to admit vice in particulars.</P>
<P>Con&s;idered as to his mind, man has act|ive as well as pa&s;&s;ive powers. He is capa|ble of deliberation and choice. He is, like|wi&s;e, capable of various impre&s;&s;ions from external objects. The&s;e impre&s;&s;ions intro|duce a change in the mind, which is the &s;ubject. A difference in the &s;ubject, gives a difference to the effects produced by the &s;ame cau&s;e. Hence it is, that, not only different men, but frequently the &s;ame man, at different times, may be very differ|ently affected by the &s;ame object, and the &s;ame motive have a different influence. Hence comes a fluctuation of choice. This fluctuation is corrected by the moral &s;en&s;e, by the force of habit and of rea&s;on, which place a choice of objects, or the admi&s;&s;ion of the cau&s;es of &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions, in the power of the mind. Were man una&s;&s;aila|ble

by external impul&s;es; were the influence of motives excluded, did his nature admit one line of conduct, only, without any mo|dification, he would be, wholly, unaccom|modating, a being wholly unaccountable. Laws might as well be promulgated to a machine. Sanctions and puni&s;hments could add no inducement to the ob&s;ervance. To an omni&s;cient and all-perfect being, this might, perhaps, be a de&s;irable &s;tate; but it is ill &s;uited to the imperfections of man.</P>
<P>Thus, by a little attention, we di&s;cover, that the very con&s;titution, which on a cur&s;|ory view, &s;eemed hardly to admit of gov|ernment and laws, is neverthele&s;s, well adapted to that &s;tate. It is no objection to &s;ay, man is imperfect; it is only to &s;ay, he is man. His imperfections, to a certain degree, fit him to be a &s;ubject of govern|ment. We &s;hall &s;ee, hereafter, that they render it indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Man has, likewi&s;e, an appetite for the approbation of others, which contributes not a little to his &s;en&s;e of accountability. The &s;en&s;e of accountability is a very princi|pal ingredient in the moral nature of man. When he has done well, he is con&s;cious that he is de&s;erving of approbation; when ill, of puni&s;hment. In the &s;ame manner, he judges of the actions of others.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See more upon this &s;ubject in &s;ec. 4 of this &s;ketch.</NOTE> Thus

he is made to perceive the ju&s;tice of puni&s;h|ment, and the moral nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ubmiting to laws, which comport with his moral nature.</P>
<P>There is one &s;en&s;e, which I will venture to call the &s;ocial &s;en&s;e. Though its effects have been often noticed, I do not recollect, that it has been di&s;tinctly handled by any writer on &s;ociety. When a man con&s;iders him&s;elf, as connected with any &s;ociety, he is, if I may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion, perceptively con&s;cious of a kind of individuality of him|&s;elf with the aggregate. The perception is more, or le&s;s di&s;tinct, as the connection is more, or le&s;s intimate. This &s;en&s;e, if it be not the germ of every &s;ocial attachment, certainly, gives &s;trength to the attachment, and vigor to patrioti&s;m it&s;elf. It is a very nece&s;&s;ary part of the &s;ocial nature of man, and of great importance to government. It is not only the &s;oul of individuality to the whole government, but, as there will be numerous &s;ubordinate connections in the &s;ame government, it makes all the individ|uals of the &s;ame connection, in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;pon&s;ors for the actions of each. They perceptively enjoy the virtues, both of the individuals of the connection, and of the ag|gregate. Each feels, as of right, the re|proach of the other's crimes, and the ju&s;tice of their puni&s;hment. I think the exi&s;tence
<PB N="56" REF="025297_0055_0FCCF3D1918AE3F8">
of the &s;ocial &s;en&s;e will not be doubted by any, who will carefully attend to the opera|tion of their own minds.</P>
<P>The perceptions of this &s;en&s;e have, in|deed, given ri&s;e to a principle, which has been gro&s;ly abu&s;ed to the oppre&s;&s;ion of mankind. In many governments, the hor|rid practice has prevailed of involving, in the puni&s;hment of offenders, all of the &s;ame family and connection, however remote. It has prevailed, mo&s;tly, in de&s;potic &s;tates. It, there, coincides with the principles of the government, which make it a crime for a man to be placed, even by nature her&s;elf, in a &s;ituation, in which he might dare to think him&s;elf injured, by the actions of the Prince. The principle, by no means ju&s;ti|fies the practice; but it, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, accounts for its origin. It, likewi&s;e, ac|counts for the practice of retaliation, repri|&s;als, and many other practices, adopted in the law of nations. And, here, humanity might vindicate her rights, and a&s;&s;ert, that the practice is, too often, carried further than the principle will warrant.</P>
<P>Patrioti&s;m, or love of country, makes an illu&s;trious figure in civil in&s;titutions. It is indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to any degree of &s;ecurity, or pro&s;perity in a nation. The whole community is the object of this pa&s;|&s;ion. In its effects, it unites the individual
<PB N="57" REF="025297_0056_0FCCF3D768BDAC18">
members, in the pur&s;uit of public mea&s;ures, and on nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ions, gives a common preference of public to private good. To the common intere&s;t, in the defence and pro&s;perity of the nation, it adds an affection, great as the object, on which it is exerted.</P>
<P>It has been made a que&s;tion by &s;ome, whether this pa&s;&s;ion be among the natural pa&s;&s;ions of man. The Abbe Raynal has a&s;&s;erted the contrary. Speaking of the inhabitants of Brazil, he &s;ays, "They &s;hew no paticular attachment to their native place. The love of country, which is a ruling pa&s;&s;ion in civilized &s;tates; which, in good governments, ri&s;es to enthu&s;ia&s;m, and in bad ones, grows habitual; <HI>this love of our country</HI> is but a f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ctitious &s;entiment ari&s;|ing from &s;ociety; but unknown in a &s;tate of nature."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. of the Indies.</NOTE> Let us carefully examine this opinion. At this day, facts, and not names, give a currency to opinions.</P>
<P>Though in &s;peaking of the Brazillians, the Abbe mentions only their want of at|tachment to their native &s;oil; yet, in his general po&s;ition, he comprehends all the mo&s;t di&s;tinctive properties of that love of country, which is, generally, denominated patrioti&s;m. In this &s;en&s;e, the love of coun|try, is the love of the community. An at|tachment to the &s;oil collects, limits, and
<PB N="58" REF="025297_0057_0FCCF3D867C31B90">
fixes the pa&s;&s;ion, and gives a locality to its object; but is not nece&s;&s;ary to its exi&s;tence. Take from the country the community, all its inhabitants, the object cea&s;es.</P>
<P>Were this pa&s;&s;ion not di&s;covered, in the fir&s;t rude &s;tate of &s;ociety, no conclu&s;ive ar|gument could, in this point, be drawn from that circum&s;tance. Mo&s;t, or all the pa&s;&s;ions of man, are, originally, capacities only. Capacities may, and do exi&s;t, antecedent to the objects, to which they are adapted. They can be di&s;covered in exerci&s;e only, and they cannot be exhibited in exerci&s;e, until they meet a proper &s;ubject for their exertion. Many of them are like plants in the germ. They exhibit not their &s;pecies, until they are expanded by a proper cultivation. Shall we &s;ay, the oak is not a tree of nature, be|cau&s;e, in its fir&s;t &s;tate, it is but a germ in the acorn? Shall we &s;ay, the appetite, which leads to the propagation of the &s;pe|cies, and its con&s;equenti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l pa&s;&s;ions, are not natural, becau&s;e they are not di&s;covered in the infant of a day?</P>
<P>If we rely on facts, hi&s;tory has not re|corded, or modern re&s;earches di&s;covered, a &s;ingle people, in this &s;tate of nature, a &s;tate, in which the love of country, an attachment to the community, does not make a con&s;pi|cuous figure. The ancient barbarians of the north, from whom the modern inhabit|ants
<PB N="59" REF="025297_0058_0FCCF3D9EE4BFD60">
of Europe are, mo&s;tly, de&s;cended, fur|ni&s;h, every where, proofs of the exi&s;tence of this pa&s;&s;ion; of vigorous national attach|ments. It is true, that their attachment to the &s;oil was not &s;o &s;trong. This attach|ment is fixed, principally, by the cultivation of the earth for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, which collects the intere&s;t and attention to one &s;pot, and gives a locality to conveniences.</P>
<P>It is not, however, true, that &s;avages have, in general, but feeble attachments to the &s;oil of their country. On the contrary, in this re&s;pect, they are, in a great mea&s;ure, capable of the &s;ame habits, pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;entiments, as the man of civilization. They occupy, with their habitations, but a &s;mall part of what they call their country. The greater part is re&s;erved for pa&s;ture, or for hunting ground. It is the great farm of the tribe. They readily remove from one part of this to another; but war, fam|ine, or &s;ome more powerful cau&s;e, is nece&s;|&s;ary to compel them to a total emigration.</P>
<P>The ancient Scythians, from whom the modern Tartars are de&s;cended, were a nation of herd&s;men. Their riches con&s;i&s;ted prin|cipally in hor&s;es, which &s;upplied them with both food and carriage. Their habitations were booths, or tents of ea&s;y con&s;truction. In a country of great extent, they prefered only tho&s;e places, which afforded the greate&s;t
<PB N="60" REF="025297_0059_0FCCF3DB6ACBEAD8" MS="y">
plenty of fre&s;h pa&s;tures. In &s;earch of the&s;e, they made frequent and di&s;tant removals.</P>
<P>We find, that among this people, as early as the reign of Darius, the &s;on of Hy&s;ta&s;pes, the love of country was a vigorous pa&s;&s;ion. Their national attachments were &s;trong, and they were attached to the &s;oil of their country, not &s;o much becau&s;e it afforded them &s;ub&s;i&s;tence by cultivation, as becau&s;e it contained the tombs of their ance&s;tors. According to Herodotus, Indathyr&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s, who was a prince, or a head warrior in that country, &s;ent the following me&s;&s;age to Da|rius, then attempting the conque&s;t of Scy|thia: &mdash;"If I fly before the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Prince of the Per&s;ians, it is not becau&s;e I fear thee. What I do now, I am u&s;ed to do in times of peace. We Scythians have neither hou&s;es nor lands to defend, if thou ha&s;t a mind to force us to come to an engagement, come and attack the tombs of our fathers, and then thou &s;halt find what manner of men we are." Such a people could be no &s;trangers to pa|trioti&s;m.</P>
<P>The &s;avages of North-America are a living in&s;tance of the vigor of this pa&s;&s;ion among a rude, uncultivated people. The European writers have been greatly abu&s;ed in their information concerning the Ameri|can natives. Buffon has a&s;&s;erted, that, "Among them, paternal love, and filial
<PB N="61" REF="025297_0060_0FCCF3DDA7493870">
affection are very faint. The mo&s;t inti|mate connection, that of family, has but feeble ties. There is no &s;ociety between one family and another; of cour&s;e there is no national union, no republic, no &s;ocial &s;tate."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">&mdash; ils aiment foiblement leurs peres &amp; leurs enfans; la &s;ociete la plus, intime de toutes, cele de la meme famille, n'a donc chez eu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> que de foible liens; la &s;ocietie d'une famille a l'autre n'en a point de tout: des lors nulle reunion, nulle re|publique, nulle etat &s;ocial. xviii. 146.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Abbe Raynal, in his ob&s;ervations on America, has copied many things from Buffon, and probably, here, he found that &s;tate of nature, to which he alludes in the pa&s;&s;age above recited. Happily, &s;uch a &s;tate of nature does not exi&s;t. In the &s;ame ac|count of the inhabitants of Brazil, the Abbe &s;peaks of their ancient mode of liv|ing, in that country. What but an attach|ment to the &s;oil could have been the cau&s;e of the continuance of this people, in the &s;ame country, thro' a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages? to what but a national attachment &s;hall we at|tribute their national manners, and the national re&s;entment of which he there &s;peaks?</P>
<P>In another place he gives an in&s;tance, which contradicts every part of the &s;ocial character given of the American natives, by Buffon, and militates, &s;trongly, again&s;t his
<PB N="62" REF="025297_0061_0FCCF3DF5C74D5F8">
own opinion, that in what he calls a &s;tate of nature, the love of country is unknown. The French wanted to per&s;uade &s;ome of the &s;avages of Canada to remove to a di&s;t|ance from their native &s;oil. On this occa|&s;ion, one of their Chiefs made the following &s;peech: "We were born (&s;aid he) on this ground. Our fathers lie buried in it. Shall we &s;ay to the bones of our fathers, Ari&s;e, and come with us into a foreign land?" Is this the language of a people, who are almo&s;t void of parental and filial affection? who have no national attach|ments? no republic? no &s;ocial &s;tate?</P>
<P>Logan, a Mingo Chief, in his &s;peech, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> &s;ent to the Governor of Virginia, at the clo&s;e of an Indian war, in the year 1774, di&s;covers the &s;ame &s;entiments of patrioti&s;m. The reader will not be di&s;plea&s;ed to &s;ee the whole of this beautiful pa&s;&s;age. It is equal to volumes on the character of that people. "I appeal to any white man," &s;ays he, "to &s;ay, if ever he came to Logan's cabin, hungry, and he gave him not meat; if he ever came cold and naked, and he clothed him not. During the cour&s;e of the la&s;t, long, and bloody war, Logan remained idle in his cabin, an advocate for peace. Such was my love for the whites, that my coun|trymen pointed as they went, and &s;aid, <HI>Logan is the friend of white men.</HI> I had

<P>Where &s;hall we find the love of country more emphatically, more beautifully ex|pre&s;&s;ed?

<P>THE rights of property make &s;o great a figure in the laws of every government, it may not be ami&s;s to give a little attention to man, in relation to tho&s;e rights. Much has been &s;aid, by writers on law and go|vernment, concerning the origin of the right of property, and many enquiries have been made, whence man comes by the idea of that right, &s;o univer&s;ally prevalent. I have met with but one opinion, which can give any &s;atisfaction on the &s;ubject. Lord Kaims has employed &s;everal e&s;&s;ays in its illu&s;tration. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ays on Morality and Natural Religion. 66. Sketches of the Hi&s;tory of Man. Book I. Sk. 3.</NOTE> The reader will readily di&s;cern, how far I am indebted to that ex|cellent author, for &s;ome of the following ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="025297_0064_0FCCF3E4B72059B8">It is now, I believe pretty generally agreed, that man is furni&s;hed with internal, as well as external &s;en&s;es. The objects of the internal &s;en&s;es are, mo&s;tly, moral rela|tions. Among the&s;e, is a &s;en&s;e of property; a &s;en&s;e, by which the mind perceives, intu|itively, without the intervention of rea&s;on|ing, a right of property. Whether it be a di&s;tinct &s;en&s;e, or a branch of the moral &s;en&s;e, is not material to enquire. This is to be ob|&s;erved, that the perception is only of relati|ons, from which re&s;ults the right of proper|ty. As a di&s;tinct &s;en&s;e, it does not extend to the modes of acqui&s;ition, but leaves them to the cognizance of the moral &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>The relation, in which con&s;i&s;ts the right of property, &s;eems not to be a moral relation, nor wholly a corporal relation, as of parts. The relation between me and the table, on which I write at pre&s;ent, by which it is mine, &s;eems to have nothing of a moral quality in it, without the intervening rela|tion of &s;ome other per&s;on. It is, doubtle&s;s, very &s;imple. It has never yet been defin|ed, otherwi&s;e, than by the mode of acqui|&s;ition; as, this piece of land is A's. He purcha&s;ed it. It was given to him. It came to him by de&s;cent. Indeed, to &s;im|ple objects of perception, whether &s;ub&s;tanc|es, or relations, names are nece&s;&s;ary, but definitions are u&s;ele&s;s, and impract<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cable.
<PB N="66" REF="025297_0065_0FCCF3E5DB728128">
Nature has denied them, in every in&s;tance. The di&s;covery, therefore, of &s;imple objects, or &s;imple relations, is not from rea&s;on, but intuition. This &s;en&s;e, though limited, at fir&s;t, and, like the other faculties, &s;ubjected to a cour&s;e of improvement, is di&s;coverable in the early &s;tages of life. The infant has, clearly, a &s;en&s;e of the right of property, though not of the modes of acqui&s;ition. He &s;eems, before he is capable of con&s;e|quential rea&s;oning, as clearly to di&s;cern his right to his rattle-box, as the adult to his hor&s;e, purcha&s;ed with his money, or his labor, and vindicates his property with as much apparent con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of that right. The perception extends, however, little farther than his own right; it can hard|ly be &s;aid to extend to the rights of others.</P>
<P>Many brute animals, to whom we have denied the powers of rea&s;on and inve&s;tiga|tion, appear, evidently, to have a &s;en&s;e of property. Give a bone to a dog, he takes it boldly as his own. Let another attempt to rob him of it, he &s;tands boldly in its de|fence, with a &s;eeming con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his right of property; while the aggre&s;&s;or ap|proaches with an apparent con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt. The ox claims a right to his &s;tall, and the dog, again, to his wonted corner. In&s;tances have been given of a &s;en&s;e of this right in the ape, the beaver, the &s;tork, and
<PB N="67" REF="025297_0066_0FCCF3E76D261B00">
&s;ome other animals, which have not fallen under my ob&s;ervation. I, therefore, omit them. It would be &s;trange if Providence had been le&s;s kind to man, than to the brute creation&mdash;man, to whom property is &s;o exten&s;ively u&s;eful, and which, in a &s;tate of &s;ociety, becomes the object or the in&s;trument of mo&s;t of his moral actions.</P>
<P>It was ob&s;erved above, that the percep|tion is only of the right, or of the relation, which con&s;titutes property, but extends not to the modes of acqui&s;ition. The&s;e modes, according to the &s;tate of &s;ociety, may be very various. In the early &s;tages of &s;ociety, or, what is frequently called a &s;tate of na|ture, the objects of property, are almo&s;t as few, and the modes of acqui&s;ition nearly as &s;imple, as among many tribes of the brute creation. The objects of property are only tho&s;e things, which are barely ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;upport exi&s;tence. The modes of acqui&s;ition are, mo&s;tly, confined to prime occupancy, and &s;ome trifling pro|ductions by labor. The &s;imple modes of gift and exchange are &s;oon added. In the progre&s;s of &s;ociety, men learn to apply to their u&s;e, either for their nece&s;&s;ities, or their plea&s;ure, mo&s;t of the numerous productions of nature. By the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of art, as the powers of the mind expand, they vary, and multiply the&s;e, without end. In propor|tion
<PB N="68" REF="025297_0067_0FCCF3ED9BC0B4B0">
as men enlarge their views of what is u&s;eful or agreeable, the hoarding appetite gains &s;trength. They become eager of the pre&s;ent, and provident of the future. The objects of property become equally numerous with the objects of de&s;ire. In &s;uch a &s;tate, the modes of acqui&s;ition are greatly diver&s;ified, and are made the &s;ubject of a great variety of laws and regulations. The whole bu&s;ine&s;s of property now ap|pears to be an artificial &s;y&s;tem; but the modes of acqui&s;ition only are the &s;ubjects of artificial regulations. The right it&s;elf, of property, is &s;ub&s;tantially founded in the relations of nature, and is di&s;covered by a natural &s;en&s;e, an intuitive perception.

<P>Here let me ob&s;erve, that from this view of the right of property, we clearly di&s;cover, that it is not, as many writers have a&s;&s;erted, the creature of the civil law only. The con&s;equences, therefore, which they have drawn from this po&s;ition, "that on a di&s;|&s;olution of government, all property is annihilated; and that every revolution of government, or radical reformation, is de|&s;tructive of the right it&s;elf of property," are by no means ju&s;t. Civil protection only is lo&s;t. The &s;ecurity of enjoyment

is endangered. The right it&s;elf, founded in the primary relations of nature, remains unchanged. But to return.</P>
<P>Without this perception, the right of property could be but weakly guarded by the moral &s;en&s;e. Were it a di&s;covery of rea&s;on, a conclu&s;ion to convenience only, it mu&s;t wait a con&s;iderable maturity of the rea&s;oning powers. It mu&s;t be wholly un|attainable to children; and, certainly, no per&s;ons, until they had, in one way or other, attained the perception, could feel any obligation of re&s;traint. Force alone could prevent a con&s;tant violation of the rights of property. Prohibitory laws would be con&s;idered as &s;o many arbitrary impo&s;i|tions. How much better is the plan of Providence! Who can forbear to admire the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s di&s;played by the Author of our being, in thus adju&s;ting the nature of man to that &s;ocial and civil &s;tate, which he has ever found nece&s;&s;ary, not only to his happine&s;s, but to any tolerable exi&s;tence in life? Deity has implanted in the nature of man, the germ of every ne|ce&s;&s;ary qualification, and left to him the cultivation. More, it is probable, could not be indulged to a moral agent.</P>

<P>We have already &s;een, that the laws of nature, as they relate to man, are the laws of &s;ocial nature; and that they have a par|ticular relation to the civil &s;tate. Indeed, it would be &s;trange to &s;uppo&s;e, that the God of all order, had, in the very nature of man, implanted the &s;eeds of incongruity and contradiction. That from an undue culti|vation, which is the work of man, incon|gruities and contradictions &s;hould ari&s;e, is not a &s;ubject of wonder. The abovemen|tioned writers, and after them, the learned Judge Black&s;tone,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Black. C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. V <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">.</NOTE> have a&s;&s;erted, that man, on entering into &s;ociety, &s;acrifices a part of his natural rights, a part of his natural liberty, the better to &s;ecure the remainder. They &s;peak of it as ari&s;ing from the original laws of his nature, and the nece&s;&s;ary nature of civil in&s;titutions. The po&s;ition &s;ounds very har&s;h, that, to the enjoyment of civil &s;ociety, man mu&s;t give up a part of his na|tural liberty; but it is always clo&s;ed with this con&s;olation, that, he, thereby, gains a greater &s;ecurity for the remainder, and is, in point of happine&s;s, a great gainer by the

Whether tho&s;e natural rights, which are &s;aid to be given up, the principal of which, are, the right of judging in his own cau&s;e, and of taking &s;atisfaction, or rather revenge, at his plea&s;ure, are rights, which any man is qualified to exerci&s;e, in all ca&s;es, con&s;i&s;tently with his own happi|ne&s;s, or that of others? Whether, in an unimproved &s;tate of &s;ociety, the infancy of the human powers and faculties, an incapa|city of developing the whole laws of his nature, and con&s;equently, of carrying them into full effect, the&s;e rights are not given to man, as a temporary provi&s;ion of nece&s;&s;ity? And that, when he is arrived at a maturity to be capable of civil combinations, and a better provi&s;ion for carrying into effect the laws of his &s;ocial nature, as far as &s;uch pro|vi&s;ion can be made, they cea&s;e to the indi|vidual of cour&s;e?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This &s;ubject is farther examined in the fir&s;t Section of Sketch IV.</NOTE> It &s;urely affords a much more agreeable reflection to &s;uppo&s;e, that, ari&s;ing from human nature, taking in a capacity for improvement, which makes

a part of the con&s;titution, there is no &s;uch oppo&s;ition between natural and civil rights. That, in &s;ome governments, men are de|prived of their natural rights, is true; but it is equally true, and equally comprehen|&s;ive to &s;ay, they are deprived of their civil rights. Such governments, either in their con&s;titution, or admini&s;tration; from weak|ne&s;s on the one &s;ide, corruption or wicked|ne&s;s on the other, have deviated from the true principles of nature.</P>
<P>The Americans &s;hould know, from ex|perience, that little more is nece&s;&s;ary to the di&s;covery of the coincidence of natural and civil rights, than the removal of ancient prejudices, or to their reconcilement in practice, than the removal of powers and bia&s;&s;es not warranted by the laws of nature. From the progre&s;s, which has already been made, they have good rea&s;on to believe, that the weakne&s;&s;es only, which are inci|dent to human nature, not any oppo&s;ition of principles, prevent the attainment of this end in the highe&s;t perfection.</P>
<P>The Marquis Beccari &s;peaks of a &s;acrifice of that univer&s;al liberty of action, common to all &s;en&s;ible beings, and limited only by our natural powers.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ay on Crimes and Puni&s;hments.

<PB N="74" REF="025297_0073_0FCCF3F8900C6DD0">
liberty, and a right to act, are convertible terms. Man has a natural, that is, a mere phy&s;ical power, to injure both him&s;elf and others. But is a liberty to do this accorded to him by the laws of his nature? that is, a right to do wrong. Power, and liberty, are not of equal extent in &s;ignification. Power is, in a &s;trict &s;en&s;e, that, by which we are enabled to exerci&s;e our liberty; not the liberty it&s;elf, when con&s;idered as a right. In a larger &s;en&s;e, it comprehends, both the right, and the power. Civil liberty is gen|erally taken in this &s;en&s;e. It will not be &s;ug|ge&s;ted, that liberty and moral obligation are at variance. I think, therefore, it will be more ju&s;t to &s;ay, that, liberty of action, common to &s;en&s;ible beings, is limited by their natural powers, by the obligations of morality, in a word, by the laws of their whole nature. To give up the performance of any action, which is forbidden by the laws of moral and &s;ocial nature, cannot be deemed a &s;acrifice.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid, that all men have a right, individually, to pur&s;ue their own intere&s;t and happine&s;s; and that, in the commerce of civil &s;ociety, there will ari&s;e oppo&s;itions, which will, frequently, oblige one to &s;a|crifice his intere&s;t, or happine&s;s, to that of an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ther.

mutual laws, the more frequently, will &s;uch oppo&s;itions ari&s;e, and &s;acrifices nece&s;&s;arily be made, and that under circum&s;tances of violence.&mdash;2.

The laws re&s;ulting from the reciprocal &s;ocial relations of men, dictate, that, when, from a want of fore&s;ight, or from the na|ture of the objects of pur&s;uit, an oppo&s;ition ari&s;es, there &s;hould be an amicable com|promi&s;e. Beyond this, nature may have given power, but &s;he has accorded no li|berty, no right to man.</P>
<P>This is the true principle of all com|merce and exchange among&s;t men; of the accommodation of all civil claims and pri|vileges, and the mutual &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of pri|vate opinion to public &s;entiment. It is true, that men, in their private intercour&s;e, often lo&s;e &s;ight of this principle, and that, in public bodies, it is too much neglected. The intere&s;ts of the minority, which, upon a right of mutual compromi&s;e, are entitled to a proportionable regard, are too often neglected, or wholly &s;acrificed to the more powerful intere&s;ts of the majority. Still, the principle, however neglected, exi&s;ts in the immutable relations of nature. If the neglect, or violation of any rule, natural,

<P>Monte&s;quieu, in treating of a &s;ubject, which led him to make a compari&s;on be|tween a &s;tate of independence, the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;tate of nature, and a &s;tate of civil govern|ment, &s;ays, "Liberty con&s;i&s;ts in not being forced to do a thing, which the laws do not oblige. People are, in this &s;tate, only as they are governed by civil laws; and be|cau&s;e they are governed by civil laws, they are free.

In another place he ob&s;erves, "As men have given up their natural in|dependence, to live under political laws, they have given up the natural community of goods, to live under civil laws; by the fir&s;t they acquired liberty, by the &s;econd, property."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">B. 26.

<PB N="77" REF="025297_0076_0FCCF3FD1C839368">
other writers, in his opinion of the liberty enjoyed in the two &s;tates. He clearly &s;up|po&s;es, that man, on entering into &s;ociety, makes an acqui&s;ition of liberty, without any &s;acrifice; or rather, that he thereby &s;ecures, to him&s;elf, free from the danger of deprivation, by force, the common rights of his nature. If I am not deceived, what has been &s;aid in this &s;ection, proves the opinion to be well founded, and that all the rights of man are relative to his &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cial na|ture. They exi&s;t only in a coincidence with the rights of the whole, in a well ordered &s;tate of &s;ociety and civil govern|ment.</P>
<P>When, therefore, we find an infringe|ment of the natural rights, or liberties of the people patronized by the con&s;titution of the &s;tate, or admitted in the admini&s;tra|tion, we ought not to excu&s;e our&s;elves from &s;earching the cau&s;e, and applying a reme|dy, under a per&s;ua&s;ion, that the people, from a certain nece&s;&s;ity of nature, con&s;ent|ed, in their civil compact, to &s;acrifice a part of their natural rights, the better to &s;ecure the remainder. At the &s;ame time, we ought to be cautious, how we di&s;turb the happine&s;s of the community, by an attempt to exerci&s;e tho&s;e rights, which, in the infancy of &s;ociety, an incapacity to di&s;cover, arrange, and give effect to the

<P>THE que&s;tion, whether Man be origin|ally depraved&mdash;whether a di&s;po&s;ition to evil, a reli&s;h for vice, as &s;uch, be a part of his nature, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate, I leave to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by the morali&s;t, and the divine. I am, here, to con&s;ider his natural powers, his di&s;po&s;ition and actions, as they relate &s;olely to his political &s;tate. Moral writers have gone upon different, and oppo&s;ite &s;y&s;tems, re&s;pecting the origin of moral evil, and the natural di&s;po&s;ition of man, as affect|ed to virtue and vice. Political writers have, uniformly, agreed. From Machiavel to Dr. Price, all have affected, that, in a political character, when entru&s;ted with power, man is totally depraved, wicked, and corrupt; that the utmo&s;t perver&s;ene&s;s, in power, is inherent in his very nature; that he is never good, but through nece&s;&s;ity.
<PB N="79" REF="025297_0078_0FCCF40044D9E5C8">
Hence mutual checks, re&s;traints, and oppo|&s;ition of powers are found nece&s;&s;ary to guard again&s;t the oppre&s;&s;ion of rulers.</P>
<P>This, if true, militates directly again&s;t, what I have all along been endeavoring to e&s;tabli&s;h; that man, by the original con&s;ti|tution of his nature, is fitted for civil go|vernment; or, as I have el&s;ewhere expre&s;&s;ed it, that Deity has implanted in him the germ of every nece&s;&s;ary qualification, for that &s;tate. Little, however, is man fitted for civil government, if no one is fit to be entru&s;ted with the execution of its powers.

<P>It is &s;aid, and truly, that every page of hi&s;tory is pregnant with in&s;tances of the abu&s;e of power. The long line of Roman Emperors, with very few exceptions, were &s;courges of the earth. All the Kings and Nobles of ancient and modern times, not excepting the philo&s;ophic Frederick of Pru&s;&s;ia,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The late King of Pru&s;&s;ia, was undoubtedly one of the be&s;t of modern ab&s;olute Monarchs.

Yet he was guil|ty of the mo&s;t flagrant abu&s;es. His &s;avage treat|ment of Baron Trenck, would have condemned, even a Monarch, le&s;s illu&s;trious, to eternal infamy, "While his army was in Great Poland, in 1771; he obliged the inhabitants, under the &s;evere&s;t pe|nalties, to take in payment, for forage, provi&s;ions, corn, and hor&s;es, the money offered by his Com|mi&s;&s;aries and troops. The money was either &s;ilver bearing the impre&s;&s;ion of Poland, and worth exactly one third of its nominal value; or ducats, &s;truck in imitation of Dutch ducats, &s;eventeen per cent. inferior to the real ducats of Holland. With this ba&s;e money he bought up corn and forage enough, not only to &s;upply his army for two whole years, but to &s;tock magazines in the country it&s;elf, where the inhabitants were forced to come and repurcha&s;e corn, for their daily &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, at an advanced price, and with good money, his Commi&s;&s;aries re|fu&s;ing to take the &s;ame coin they had paid. <HI>By this hone&s;t and ma&s;terly manoeuvre,</HI> it is &s;aid he gain|ed, at the lowe&s;t calculation, <HI>&s;even millions of dol|lars!!!</HI>"&mdash;A crime much le&s;s mean and ba&s;e, would have gibbeted one of his &s;ubjects.</P>

their own right, without controul. An effect &s;o univer&s;al, it is &s;aid, mu&s;t have a univer&s;al cau&s;e in the nature of man. All this is true; and yet I will venture, at the hazard of being thought &s;ingular, to di&s;|&s;ent from the common opinion, re&s;pecting the real cau&s;e. I apprehend the effect is not &s;o generally produced, by any maligni|ty, any culpable di&s;po&s;ition in the nature of man; but that it is mo&s;tly the effect of &s;ituation. I do not doubt the univer&s;ality of the effect, or rather, if you plea&s;e, of the event, of a con&s;tant abu&s;e of power, in certain &s;ituations. I doubt only of the cau&s;e. I think the cau&s;e is of a nature ve|ry different from that, which has u&s;ually been a&s;&s;igned. I &s;u&s;pect, that it is a little more complex, and, that it is the effect of other cau&s;es; &s;ome exi&s;ting in the nature of man, others ari&s;ing from the nature of the power, and the u&s;ual mode of betru&s;t|ment. It will, perhaps, be thought, if the effect, in all the extent and uniformity con|tended for, be allowed, it is of little con&s;e|quence, to the &s;cience of government, what the particular cau&s;es are. The &s;ame checks, the &s;ame oppo&s;ition of powers, will be nece&s;&s;ary, to guard again&s;t the abu&s;e. But let it be remembered, that, in applying a remedy to an evil, little &s;ucce&s;s can be expected, if the cau&s;e of the evil be un|known,
<PB N="82" REF="025297_0081_0FCCF40A2913FDC0">
or mi&s;taken. It is much more eli|gible, where there is a po&s;&s;ibility, to re|move or prevent the cau&s;e, than to be obliged to maintain a con&s;tant &s;truggle again&s;t the effect, or to be perpetually em|ployed, in palliating, or diverting its ma|lignity. According to our different ap|prehen&s;ions of the cau&s;e, the remedy applied will be different, and the event more or le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be remembered, that man is a complex being. He is by nature con&s;ti|tuted with a great variety of pa&s;&s;ions, ap|petites, powers, and faculties; &s;en&s;es, ex|ternal and internal, adapted to the percep|tion of objects, and relations, phy&s;ical and moral. Some of the&s;e have a more imme|diate relation to his individual being and happine&s;s; yet not &s;o as to &s;tand oppo&s;ed to &s;ociety. Others have a more immediate relation to &s;ociety; yet not to the exclu|&s;ion of &s;elf. He was not made for inde|pendence but for mutual connexion, mu|tual dependence, and to this, every thing in his nature is, more or le&s;s relative. On the right di&s;cernment of moral relations, either &s;ingly, or in their various combina|tions, ari&s;ing from objects, &s;ituation, and circum&s;tances, depends the ju&s;tne&s;s of his moral perceptions; on marking the re&s;ult with preci&s;ion, depends the knowlege of his
<PB N="83" REF="025297_0082_0FCCF40B54909A48">
duty, a knowlege of the laws of his nature. He is, from the con&s;titution of his nature, capable of impre&s;&s;ions from an infinite variety of objects, both external and inter|nal. For the opperations of the mind, by reflection, become objects, and again have their impre&s;&s;ions. The&s;e impre&s;&s;ions give an equal variety to the modifications of his pa&s;&s;ions, appetites, powers, and faculties, not only &s;ingly, but in all their various combinations. The re&s;ult of all the&s;e, con&s;titutes the temper, di&s;po&s;ition, and character of the man; and from the various modifications, ari&s;es, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the various influence of motives. Were man left in this &s;ituation, he would be the &s;port of blind impul&s;es. There &s;eems to be a nece&s;&s;ity for a balance, as well as &s;ome ar|biter of moral action. The power of rea|&s;oning, by which he combines, compares, di&s;tingui&s;hes, and marks the re&s;ult, has, by &s;ome ethical writers, been con&s;idered as being to man, the balance of his moral powers, and the arbiter of his actions. I think this is not the office of rea&s;on. Rea&s;on is rather the hand that adju&s;ts the balance, limits and extends it, than the balance it&s;elf.

<PB N="85" REF="025297_0084_0FCCDA314A871D38">
combinations, will di&s;cover, that rea|&s;on, in&s;tead of being qualified to &s;erve as a balance, has, it&s;elf, need of a balance, a &s;teady principal for its regulation. Na|ture, always equal to her wants, has provi|ded &s;uch a principle. This is a &s;en&s;e of accountability found in the brea&s;t of every rational being. Mention was made of this &s;en&s;e, in a former &s;ection; but I find it nece&s;&s;ary to examine it with a little more attention.</P>
<P>Whether the &s;en&s;e of accountability be a di&s;tinct &s;en&s;e, a branch of the moral &s;en&s;e, or a certain &s;tate of the mind, produced by the moral &s;en&s;e, in a perception of certain moral relations, and in a view of certain objects, is not ea&s;y to determine. I am, however, inclined to believe the latter. In examining this principle of our nature, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to keep in view the moral &s;en&s;e; the &s;en&s;e, by which we di&s;|cern moral relations.</P>
<P>Man has, as was ob&s;erved in a former &s;ection, a pa&s;&s;ion, a de&s;ire, an appetite, call it by what name we plea&s;e, for the appro|bation of others. He extends it to all in|telligent beings, whom he conceives to be, in any way, conu&s;ant of his actions; and its force is increa&s;ed, or dimini&s;hed, in pro|portion to the relation, or connection, in which he conceives him&s;elf placed, in re|&s;pect
<PB N="86" REF="025297_0085_0FCCF40FD05A0900">
to &s;uch beings. In the &s;ame extent, and in the &s;ame proportion he dreads their di&s;approbation, or cen&s;ure. When the moral &s;en&s;e informs him, that his actions are right, he is con&s;cious, that he de&s;erves their approbation. On the contrary, when he has done wrong, he is con&s;cious, that he is de&s;erving of their cen&s;ure. He is con&s;cious to him&s;elf of a feeling of appro|bation, and di&s;approbation of the conduct of others, as he views it to be right, or wrong. Judging from his own feelings, and the expre&s;&s;ions he meets in others, he rightly expects to find the &s;ame &s;entiments in all. Thus man finds him&s;elf bound to his duty by a three fold cord of accounta|bility,&mdash;to God&mdash;to him&s;elf&mdash;and to his fellow men. Thus the moral &s;en&s;e, and the &s;en&s;e of accountability, con&s;tantly operat|ing, though not exempt from the imperfec|tions incident to the nature of man, con|&s;titute the balance of his moral powers, and a &s;teady principle for the regulation of his actions. Rea&s;on, by comparing circum|&s;tances, marking the re&s;ult, and detecting the impo&s;itions, to which all the &s;en&s;es, as well external, as internal, are, more or le&s;s liable, is qualified to adju&s;t the balance. Here we may again ob&s;erve, that neither the moral &s;en&s;e, the &s;en&s;e of accountability, or the rea&s;oning powers, are given in per|fection
<PB N="87" REF="025297_0086_0FCCF4117B510730">
to man. They are but plants in the germ, the growth and improvement of which is to be expected only from a proper cultivation.</P>
<P>I cannot but flatter my&s;elf, that the di&s;|tinctions, which I have endeavored to make, are intelligible, and the principles fully a&s;|certained. By the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the&s;e prin|ciples, we may, perhaps, be able to throw &s;ome light on the que&s;tion concerning the origin of &s;o univer&s;al an abu&s;e of power.</P>
<P>The propriety of a man's conduct, will depend, principally, on a ju&s;t di&s;cernment of moral relations, an accurate perception of what is right and what is wrong in moral action; on the means of informa|tion, the &s;trength of his rea&s;oning powers, and a full &s;en&s;e of his accountability, to his Maker, to him&s;elf, and to his fellow men. In proportion as there is a deficiency in one, or all of the&s;e, he will be expo&s;ed to a vi|cious conduct. Every deviation from right, by changing the force of habit to the weaker &s;ide, &s;trengthens and confirms the bias. He, therefore, who, in life and ac|tion, would per&s;evere in virtue, mu&s;t be|ware, how he indulges any deception upon the moral &s;en&s;e, any bias, upon his rea&s;on, or a relaxation of his &s;en&s;e of accountability. Free a man from his &s;en&s;e of accountabili|ty only, he is left to the dominion of the
<PB N="88" REF="025297_0087_0FCCF4142CAFF4E8">
pa&s;&s;ions and appetites, and driven precipi|tately into vice; as if, from a watch in mo|tion, you were &s;uddenly to detach the ba|lance. That branch of the &s;en&s;e of ac|countability, by which man perceives his actions, of right, &s;ubjected to the approba|tion, or cen&s;ure of his fellow men, is not the lea&s;t efficacious in pre&s;erving the bal|ance of his moral powers. Yet this &s;en&s;e, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the moral being, may, as it re|gards mankind, be wholly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, merely by the &s;ituation of the man. Place a man either above, or below the regard of mankind, and he will no longer feel him&s;elf accountable to them for his actions. He, who, in &s;uch a &s;ituation, can maintain the guard of his virtue, and &s;ucce&s;sfully re&s;i&s;t the &s;olicitations of his pa&s;&s;ions and appetites; the covert approaches, and the open attacks of vice, is &s;omething more than human Such is the original adju&s;t|ment of human nature, its parts, connec|tions, and dependencies, mutually &s;up|porting and &s;upported, from which re&s;ult the laws of moral action, that not a pin can be loo&s;ened, without endangering a derang|ment of the whole &s;tructure.</P>
<P>That political &s;ituation, which places a man, in any degree of independence on tho&s;e, over whom he exerci&s;es a power, in the &s;ame degree cheri&s;hes the emotions of
<PB N="89" REF="025297_0088_0FCCF415BA2383B0">
pride. It transforms that, which, before, was only a laudable contempt of what is low, mean, and unworthy the man, into haughtine&s;s, under the name of grandeur. It excites a contempt for men, and &s;up|pre&s;&s;es tho&s;e &s;entiments, which &s;ubjected him to their approbation, or cen&s;ure. Such has been, more or le&s;s, the &s;ituation of all hereditary Monarchs on the globe; of all ari&s;tocrats, and ari&s;tocratical bodies; of all men in power, who have had, or conceived them&s;elves to have the ability of continu|ing their power, independent of tho&s;e, over whom it was exerci&s;ed; in a word, of all tho&s;e, who hold their power in contempt of the people. A &s;ituation, not indulged to man, by the laws of his nature, and which Providence has, often, hitherto with little effect, warned him, by the pernicious con|&s;equences, not to entru&s;t to any one of the race. The wonder is, not, that men, in &s;uch a &s;ituation, &s;hould have been guilty of &s;o many vices, but that they &s;hould have exhibited even a few virtues. Could we &s;trip the actions of Princes and Nobles, of the eclat of character, how few have been the&s;e virtues, we &s;hould be informed, in every page of their hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>In&s;tances of con&s;tant and flagrant abu&s;e of power, by men, thus &s;ituated, demon|&s;trably prove, that it is dangerous to exceed
<PB N="90" REF="025297_0089_0FCCF418121D63E0">
the limits of our nature, to &s;tep beyond the reach of its laws; but they prove no ori|ginal malignity in man. In a different &s;ituation, within the limits a&s;&s;igned by the laws of human nature, men have admini&s;|tered the powers of government, with the greate&s;t abilities, and the mo&s;t exalted vir|tues, for the &s;ole good of the community. May we not in&s;tance more than one ex|ample in the United States of America? In &s;ituations, in which rulers have held them&s;elves fully accountable to the &s;enti|ments of the people, for the exerci&s;e of the powers, with which they were entru&s;ted, they have conducted with as much integ|rity and virtue as have been exhibited in the more private &s;cenes of life. It mu&s;t be allowed, indeed, that few &s;uch &s;ituations have yet been devi&s;ed by political wi&s;dom. When a people are capable of forming a con&s;titution of government upon natural principles, and e&s;tabli&s;hing a power of ad|mini&s;tration within the limits a&s;&s;igned to man by the laws of his nature, they will be &s;ecure again&s;t the danger of any exorbitant abu&s;e. Care mu&s;t always be taken to guard again&s;t all independence in the rul|ers, on the &s;entiments of the people, and to provide, that they &s;hall admini&s;ter, not their own power, but the powers of government.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION V.</HI> Of the Nece&s;&s;ity of Civil Laws and Government.</HEAD>
<P>AGREEABLY to the plan of the pre|&s;ent Sketch, one que&s;tion only remains for di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. Whence ari&s;es the nece&s;&s;ity upon man of adopting civil laws and gov|ernment?&mdash;As was before ob&s;erved, &s;ome have thought, that the nece&s;&s;ity aro&s;e from the perver&s;ene&s;s &s;olely of human nature. They a&s;&s;ert, that men have, inherent in their nature, a reli&s;h for vice, an original propen&s;ity to evil; to re&s;train the maligni|ty of which, they were laid under a nece&s;&s;ity of civil government; that true virtue, ge|nuine benevolence, would have led them, happily, through the mo&s;t complicated &s;cenes, which could have fallen to their lot in &s;ociety. How the account &s;tands between them and their Maker, it is not my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e to enquire. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that their civil and political
<PB N="92" REF="025297_0091_0FCCF41B52998920">
conduct, does not avow a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;uch depravity of nature. They appear, in all ca&s;es, where no particular bias of pa&s;&s;ion or intere&s;t is di&s;coverable, to have full reliance on the ju&s;tice, integrity, and veracity of each other.</P>
<P>Some, who have had le&s;s gloomy views of human nature, have holden, that the nece&s;&s;ity ari&s;es from the weakne&s;s, only, of individuals, requiring mutual aid, for &s;up|plying their mutual wants. This would, however, lead no farther, than the &s;ocial &s;tate. It would not, alone, induce the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of civil government. We have &s;een, that man, by his natural con&s;titution, was intended for the latter &s;tate. We &s;hall now find, ari&s;ing from his nature, a nece&s;|&s;ity for adopting it; but a nece&s;&s;ity of a very different kind from any thing, which has been &s;ugge&s;ted.</P>
<P>Men have a reli&s;h for &s;ociety. It is the &s;cene of their improvements, and the great &s;ource of their happine&s;s. Still no goodne&s;s of heart can enable them to en|joy its benefits, without an e&s;tabli&s;hment of laws.</P>
<P>Perception, conciou&s;ne&s;s, and volition, or tho&s;e powers, which originate, and di|rect external action in men, belong to them, individually. A &s;ociety con&s;i&s;ting of any number of individuals, can have no
<PB N="93" REF="025297_0092_0FCCF41D599C03D8">
common united perception, con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, or volition. Could this be the ca&s;e, a &s;o|ciety might will, and with a &s;ingle act of voli|tion, direct, and controul the actions of all, and every member, with the &s;ame ea&s;e and regularity, with which an individual directs, and controuls the motions of his own body, and its members. But this is denied to man in the aggregate, and in e|very combination of &s;ociety. The will of a &s;ociety is made up of the individual wills of its members.</P>
<P>Had man been formed with faculties, which might have enabled him, with an intuitive glance, to penetrate, and compre|hend as they ari&s;e, the individual wills of all the members of the &s;ociety, and of all, who&s;e conduct, might in any way affect it; to penetrate and comprehend the pa&s;&s;ions, appetites, and pur&s;uits, of every individu|al; in a word, to comprehend all the cau|&s;es, by which God governs the actions of moral agents; were he endued with rea|&s;on, &s;ufficient to arrange the whole, &s;o as to prevent any individual interference; goodne&s;s of heart and firmne&s;s of mind, to enable him to pur&s;ue the arrangement; in &s;uch a &s;tate, both of knowlege and di&s;|po&s;ition, he would &s;tand in no need of civil laws, or rules pre&s;cribed by common con&s;ent, for the regulation of &s;ocial con|duct.
<PB N="94" REF="025297_0093_0FCCF41ED520B4E8">
But &s;uch a &s;tate falls not to the lot of any finite being.</P>
<P>Our po&s;itive knowlege is, only partial, of the pre&s;ent and pa&s;t, depending on act|ual and accurate ob&s;ervation. There is, however, given us &s;ome clue to the future. We are able to perceive certain relations of cau&s;e and effect. As far as experience leads, we find a uniformity in the cour&s;e of nature. We di&s;cover &s;ome of the cau&s;|es, and &s;ome of the laws, by which phy&s;|ical effects are produced in a regular chain. Of others, we are wholly ignorant, or have, at be&s;t, but an imperfect glimp&s;e. Much more imperfect is our knowlege of the cau&s;es, which produce and vary human ac|tions, &s;ubjected to the influence of motives, to the choice of the agent, and to tho&s;e laws, by which they are governed in a train. In an exten&s;ive &s;ociety, individu|als can have but a limited knowlege, even of the pre&s;ent actions of the whole. Their knowlege of the intentions and cau&s;es, up|on which the future actions depend, is much more limited. We are able to gain &s;ome knowlege of the leading principles of actions, of the motives which generally prevail, and the &s;pecies of action, which they will produce, in certain characters, and in certain &s;ituations. To de&s;cend to every &s;ituation, every character, and thence
<PB N="95" REF="025297_0094_0FCCF420F77868B0">
to learn fully, the particular influence of motives and the individual actions, which will follow, in each, is beyond the reach of human &s;agacity. In a &s;ociety compo&s;ed of any con&s;iderable number of individu|als, and in a &s;tate of any con&s;iderable ac|tivity, there will be many, and very dif|ferent &s;ituations. The influence of mo|tives upon individuals, will be very dif|ferent. They will have a variety of di&s;|tinct intere&s;ts, and pur&s;uits, and tho&s;e, not at all, or very imperfectly known to each other in their origin. However innocent and right, tho&s;e intere&s;ts and pur&s;uits may be, when con&s;idered &s;eparately, they will, by frequent, though unintentional inter|ferences, and oppo&s;itions, form a &s;cene too intricate for the powers of the human mind to evolve. Could we &s;uppo&s;e every per&s;on in the &s;ociety to be actuated, by principles of the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted benev|olence, and the mo&s;t accommodating &s;pi|rit, the whole time mu&s;t be con&s;umed in compromi&s;e. None could be left for action.</P>
<P>Without a &s;ocial perception, con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s, and volition, with any goodne&s;s, and with any wi&s;dom, &s;hort of infinite, the &s;tate of &s;ociety would, at be&s;t, be a &s;cene of inextricable confu&s;ion. To Remedy this confu&s;ion, nature has pointed out to
<PB N="96" REF="025297_0095_0FCCF421D8E02618">
man, the nece&s;&s;ity of civil e&s;tabli&s;hments, and the promulgation of laws. Here is a provi&s;ion analagous to his nature. By the e&s;tabli&s;hent of laws, which the individuals of the community have &s;ubmitted to ob|&s;erve, as the rules of their future conduct, they are enabled, with a &s;ufficient degree of certainty, to fore&s;ee the future intere&s;ts and pur&s;uits of each. By following the line pre&s;cribed, they can avoid every con|&s;iderable interference, or by applying the rule, may remedy the inconvenience. In no other way, is it po&s;&s;ible to connect a community, either in &s;entiments, or inter|e&s;ts; to unite the public force; to direct it to the attainment of any common good, or to the avoiding or repelling of any com|mon evil. In no other way is it po&s;&s;ible to give any &s;ecurity to public or private rights.</P>
<P>Still men are imperfect. They will be guilty of deviations from the rule, tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions of the law, and infringements of each other's rights. This will happen, &s;ome times, thro' ignorance of the law, or of the right; an ignorance, which ari&s;es from weakne&s;s in judging, or inattention in ex|amining. Sometimes, it will happen thro' the prevalence of intere&s;t, or the violence of pa&s;&s;ion. Therefore, to give the laws a compul&s;ory force, and to &s;ecure a general
<PB N="97" REF="025297_0096_0FCCF423B8C20B68">
ob&s;ervance, they mu&s;t be &s;o calculated, that every member of the community &s;hall find a convenience, in the ob&s;ervance, and a certain inconvenience, in the neglect or violation. Hence ari&s;es the nece&s;&s;ity of penalties. The&s;e penalties are, from the weakne&s;s of men in di&s;cerning tendencies, and their con&s;equent liability to vice, ne|ce&s;&s;arily enhanced. Hence al&s;o ari&s;es the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ubordination, and of civil rul|ers, to give activity and efficiency to the laws. In a &s;tate of greater perfection, than is to be found, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ocie|ty, a greater perfection of knowlege and virtue, penalties may make a le&s;s formidable appearance; but, in every &s;tate, the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of penalties will equally exi&s;t.</P>
<P>In a community compo&s;ed of a few in|dividuals, in a &s;imple &s;tate of manners, and of property, the motives to action are few; con&s;equently, there is little activity of individuals. A few &s;imple rules, mo&s;tly adopted and &s;upported by cu&s;tom, and frequent con&s;ultations, upon pre&s;ent emer|gences, &s;upply the place of a more regular polity. They are the fir&s;t rude e&s;&s;ays in civil in&s;titutions. Still, in every &s;tate of morals and manners, a nece&s;&s;ity of known and e&s;tabli&s;hed rules equally exi&s;ts. On the whole, we may &s;afely conclude, that no order of beings, &s;hort of infinite per|fection,
<PB N="98" REF="025297_0097_0FCCF424E4E61738">
in wi&s;dom, as well as goodne&s;s, can &s;ub&s;i&s;t in &s;ociety, without an e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of government and laws.</P>

<P>ALL our rea&s;onings, drawn from the nature of man, induce the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory conclu&s;ion, that he was intended for &s;ocie|ty, and coincide, in the large&s;t &s;en&s;e, with the divine enunciation of his Maker, "It i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">not good, that man &s;hould be alone." <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ea&s;oning from the &s;ame &s;ource, it is equal|ly clear, that he was intended for civil government, and laid under a phy&s;ical nece&s;&s;ity of adopting it.

before they were able to di&s;cover, and ar|range tho&s;e laws of their nature, which lead to a &s;afe and happy e&s;tabli&s;hment, upon natural principles. It has pa&s;&s;ed into a proverb, that any government is prefera|ble to anarchy&mdash;a &s;tate of individual inde|pendence.</P>
<P>The general circum&s;tances and manners of the age have prevailed to general e&s;tab|li&s;hments, in forms of government. The general circum&s;tances and manners of a people, have prevailed to particular e&s;tab|li&s;hments. In the very early &s;tages of &s;ociety, while &s;implicity in manners, in knowlege, in wants, and in means, prevails, there is, always, a great degree of equality among men. The pa&s;&s;ions, which, in &s;ome of the following &s;tages, lead to inequality, rarely exerted, hold, nearly an equal tenor. Every thing is enjoyed in common. This &s;tate is a kind of natural republic, &s;uited to the infant &s;tate of humanity. It has been ob&s;erved, that this is a &s;tate of na|ture; but the nature of man points him to improvement. A perpetual continuance of a nation in this &s;tate, would be as un|natural, as perpetual infancy to an indivi|dual.</P>
<P>In the progre&s;s towards maturity, the avenues to knowlege are di&s;covered, by circum&s;tances, accidental to man. He
<PB N="100" REF="025297_0099_0FCCF4C8B73623D8">
cannot, from the limitation of his powers and faculties, proceed on generals. His progre&s;s is in particulars. One di&s;covery opens an unexpected avenue to others. Proceeding thus by particulars, it is clear, that the progre&s;s of knowlege mu&s;t be &s;low, and the views exhibited to the mind nece&s;|&s;arily partial. Objects, in the progre&s;s, ari&s;ing &s;ingly, and &s;urpri&s;ing by their no|velty, have a powerful effect upon an un|improved mind. Accordingly the few pa&s;&s;ions, which they are calculated to ex|cite, are powerfully inflamed. The moral &s;en&s;e, and the rea&s;oning powers can never be in advance. They, nece&s;&s;arily, pur&s;ue at a di&s;tance. Such is the progre&s;s to im|provement; &s;uch the boi&s;terous youth of humanity; &s;uch the difficult pa&s;&s;age from ignorance to the knowlege of truth, through a wilderne&s;s of errors. Hence the moral balance is, frequently lo&s;t, and a violent &s;tate of the pa&s;&s;ions, which gives a peculi|arity to the manner<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, &s;ucceeds. Both the vices and the virtues are more prominent. There happens a frequent change of man|ners, but &s;eldom for the better. The change ari&s;es from the prevalence of one kind of pa&s;&s;ion or appetite, and a &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion of different objects of gratification. It is a change from one mode of violence to another. Violence is &s;till the great
<PB N="101" REF="025297_0100_0FCCDA398B4F2FF8">
characteri&s;tic. Hence, we find a re&s;emb|lance of monarchy and ari&s;tocracy, in the pa&s;&s;ions. In this &s;tate of &s;ociety, men al|mo&s;t unavoidably, fall into a monarchy, or an ari&s;tocracy in government; in&s;titutions of violence, for the re&s;traint of violent pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Men proceeding, gradually, in improve|ment, though, with frequent digre&s;&s;ions, and retrogradations, to what may be called a &s;tate of &s;ocial manhood, the natural pa&s;|&s;ions, from a more general acquaintance of the mind with objects, are brought more equally into exerci&s;e, and form a mutual check on the violence of each other. The rea&s;oning powers, by con&s;tant and exten|&s;ive employment, acquire acutene&s;s, com|prehen&s;ion, and &s;trength. The moral &s;en&s;e, and the &s;en&s;e of accountability, ac|quire a greater degree of a&s;cendency. It is perceived, that happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts, not in exce&s;s, but in equable enjoyment; and, that the violent indulgence of one pa&s;&s;ion, excludes the gratification of the re&s;t. Hence proceeds a moderation. In this &s;tate, there is more gratification, and le&s;s violence.

<P><PB N="105" REF="025297_0104_0FCCF42A9D6CD640">In the &s;cience of government, politi|cians, in like manner, univer&s;ally began with the Rulers.

<P>The revolutions, which have happened, among the nations of the earth, in know|lege and in government, have, by degrees, opened the eyes of mankind. They have, in &s;ome in&s;tances, learnt, and have even dared to a&s;&s;ert, that all legitimate govern|ment is founded in the rights of the peo|ple; that it is an in&s;titution for their con|venience and happine&s;s; that the ruler has no right as a man, beyond that of ev|ery individual; and that the power, which he exerci&s;es, is not his power, but the pow|er and right of the people, entru&s;ted for their benefit.

of the tru&s;t. But he can never indulge to the people a right, of which they are not the original proprietors. The time &s;eems to be at hand, when, among many nations, the clemency of the Prince will become as contemptible, as the di&s;pen&s;ing pow|er of the Pope, and will be deemed equally an in&s;ult on the common &s;en&s;e of mankind.</P>
<P>Before we proceed to treat of the or|ganization of government, it may be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to take a &s;ummary view of tho&s;e rights of man, to &s;ecure the free, equal, and legitimate enjoyment of which, is the principal object of civil in&s;titutions.</P>
<P>I &s;hall take the liberty to u&s;e the words of Mr. Paine, to which I &s;hall add a &s;hort comment of my own:</P>
<P><Q>Natural rights are tho&s;e, which ap|pertain to man in right of his exi&s;tence. Of this kind are all the intellectual rights, or rights of the mind. And al&s;o all tho&s;e rights of acting as an individual for his own comfort and happine&s;s, which are not injurious to the natural rights of others. Civil rights are tho&s;e, which appertain to man in right of his being a member of &s;ociety. Every civ|il right has &s;ome natural right preexi&s;t|ing in the individual; but to which his individual power is not, in all ca&s;es,
<PB N="107" REF="025297_0106_0FCCF42E944CABA8">
&s;ufficiently competent. Of this kind are all tho&s;e, which relate to &s;ecurity and protection.</Q></P>
<P>He then goes on to di&s;tingui&s;h between the natural rights, which man retains, after entering into &s;ociety, and tho&s;e, which he depo&s;its, according to his view, in the com|mon &s;tock, as a member of the &s;ociety.</P>
<P><Q>The natural rights, which he retains, are all tho&s;e, in which the power to ex|ecute is as perfect in the individual as the right it&s;elf: Among this cla&s;s are, as is before mentioned, all intellectual rights, or rights of the mind; con&s;equently, Religion is one of tho&s;e rights. The natural rights, which are not retained, are all tho&s;e, which, though they are perfect in the individual, the power to execute them is defective. They an&s;wer not his purpo&s;e. A man has a natural right to judge in his own cau&s;e; and &s;o far as the right of the mind is concerned, he never &s;urrenders it. But what avail|eth it him to judge, if he hath not the power to redre&s;s? He therefore depo|&s;its this right in the common &s;tock of &s;ociety, and takes the arm of &s;ociety, of which he is a part, in preference and ad|dition to his own arm. Society grants him nothing. Every man is a proprietor in &s;ociety, and draws on the capital, as a matter of right.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="025297_0107_0FCCF431296D2210">The&s;e ob&s;ervations are, in a general view, excellent. They are not, however, in every point, ju&s;t. Mr. Paine's genius does not, always, admit of accurate rea&s;on|ing, either in di&s;covering principles, or in tracing con&s;equences. But what is often of more value, he &s;eizes his object by an intuitive glance, and is generally happy in exhibiting it to others in a &s;triking point of light.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s of judging is relative to the rights of ju&s;tice, and comes in for the &s;ake of tho&s;e rights. Men have, reciprocally, a right to demand ju&s;tice of each other, and are reciprocally bound, in duty, to make an adequate &s;atisfaction for injuries. The right of judging amounts to a right of de|ciding, what is ju&s;t between one individual and another; a right of determining, what &s;atisfaction ought to be made for in|juries, and in what manner. The judge is equally bound to judge ju&s;tly. But, &s;uch we know, for a general rule, is the nature of man, that he is incapable of judging ju&s;tly, that is, impartially, in his own cau&s;e. In all matters, which depend on a right of mutual compromi&s;e, he is the only judge of his own intere&s;t, and an actor in his own cau&s;e. In repelling pre&s;ent injuries, a pre|&s;ent inva&s;ion of his own rights, he has a right to judge, both of the means, and the
<PB N="109" REF="025297_0108_0FCCF4325DA03E68">
mea&s;ure of defence; and this from nece&s;&s;i|ty. But he mu&s;t judge rightly, that is, agreeably to the occa&s;ion, at the peril of becoming an aggre&s;&s;or. The right is not independent, and without appeal.</P>
<P>There is, therefore, a deficiency in point of capacity to judge, as well as in point of power to execute. From a little con&s;ider|ation, it will be evident, that this right of judging in his own cau&s;e, is a temporary right, entru&s;ted to man from nece&s;&s;ity on|ly, until he &s;hall have arrived at a maturity to be capable of comprehending and car|rying into full operation that law of his nature, which makes him accountable to the judgment of others, and which dictates, in all controver&s;ies, a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to an im|partial judge. Every one, as well the party injuring, as the party injured, has a right to an impartial and ju&s;t deci&s;ion; and na|ture has pointed out the means of obtaining it. The right of ju&s;tice is perpetual. The right of judging, with a view of compel|ling &s;atisfaction, is only incidental, and comes in, le&s;t there &s;hould be a failure of the former. When men become capable of providing for a regular admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice in government, that right, which was de&s;igned to be temporary, &s;o far as &s;uch provi&s;ion is made, cea&s;es of cour&s;e. It cannot be &s;aid, with propriety, to be
<PB N="110" REF="025297_0109_0FCCF434F7235370">
given up, by any act of the individual, or thrown into the common &s;tock of &s;ociety. Such rights may, as it re&s;pects &s;ociety, be well denominated juvenile rights. In the progre&s;s of &s;ociety towards maturity, the &s;ame thing happens to the&s;e rights, which happens to the juvenile pa&s;&s;ions and appe|tites of an individual. Many little pa&s;&s;ions and appetites exi&s;t in infancy, and in early youth, which, though proper and nece&s;&s;ary to that &s;tate, are neverthele&s;s unbecoming the &s;tate of manhood. They are never given up, by any &s;pecific act of the mind, but agreeably to the con&s;titution of nature, they give place, in the progre&s;s of the in|dividual, to pa&s;&s;ions and appetites proper and nece&s;&s;ary to an advanced &s;tate, and one after another become extinct.</P>
<P>I am apprehen&s;ive that the legal notion of the nece&s;&s;ity of a con&s;ideration to the validity of a contract, fir&s;t introduced, or at lea&s;t, has &s;upported the opinion, that men, on entering into &s;ociety, give up a part of their rights, as a con&s;ideration for the &s;ecurity of the remainder. Writers on government have been anxious, on the part of the people, to di&s;cover a con&s;idera|tion given for the right of protection, and the right of ju&s;tice. While government was &s;uppo&s;ed to depend on a compact, not between the individuals of a people, but
<PB N="111" REF="025297_0110_0FCCF43564EBFB08">
between the people and the rulers, this was a point of great con&s;equence. But it can be of no con&s;equence, when it is un|der&s;tood, that government is produced by the individuals entering into a compact among them&s;elves for that purpo&s;e. We have no occa&s;ion to look for any con&s;idera|tion for the duty of obedience to the laws, on the one &s;ide, or, an equal and ju&s;t admi|ni&s;tration, on the other, but the inviolable obligation ari&s;ing from the laws of &s;ocial nature.</P>
<P>Nature has pointed out civil government as a mean, not an end; a mean of &s;ecuring the greate&s;t quantity of happine&s;s to all, with the lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible inconvenience to individuals. Formed as man is by nature, for &s;ociety and civil government, he is in a &s;olitary &s;tate, or a &s;tate of independence, too emphatically, called the &s;tate of nature, excluded the benefit of mo&s;t of the laws of his nature; the free enjoyment of al|mo&s;t the whole of his natural rights, ex|cepting tho&s;e, which are connected with his individual exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>The greater part of his rights are not exclu&s;ively, and independently, in him&s;elf. They ari&s;e in &s;ociety, and are relative to it. Antecedently to that &s;tate, they could exi&s;t only potentially. The rights of all have a reciprocal relation to the rights of each,
<PB N="112" REF="025297_0111_0FCCF439281D0718">
and can never be rightly apprehended, di&s;tinct from that relation. Tho&s;e rights, which Mr. Paine calls the natural rights of man, are more independent, more im|mediately united to his being, like the con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his individual exi&s;tence. &mdash; Tho&s;e, which he calls the civil rights of man, are the children of his nature, the i&s;&s;ue of the &s;ocial union, to which he is di|rected, invited, and impelled, by the laws of his creation. Both are natural rights, and equally guaranteed to him by the laws of his nature. The difference is, that tho&s;e which he calls natural rights, are independ|ently perfect, and the enjoyment full in the individual. Tho&s;e, which he calls civil rights, are relative. They ari&s;e from the union of men in &s;ociety. The more perfect the union, the more legitimately natural are tho&s;e rights, and the more full the en|joyment.</P>
<P>That &s;ociety, in the admini&s;tration of right, grants nothing to any of its members; that every man is a proprietor, and draws on the capital, as a matter of right, is one of tho&s;e high and immutable truths, which are allowed to be taught, in their full ex|tent, only in a democratic republic. In a monarchical, or ari&s;tocratical government, the very thought would be deemed a &s;pe|cies of trea&s;on.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION II.</HI> Few Governments formed by an actual Com|pact.&mdash;In&s;tability of ancient Governments&mdash; Social Compact in the Formation of a legi|timate Government.&mdash;Civil Powers.&mdash; Divi&s;ion and Limitation.</HEAD>
<P>FEW governments, ancient or modern, have been con&s;tituted by an actual com|pact among the people. The powers of government, have, in mo&s;t in&s;tances, been blindly conferred upon one, or a few indi|viduals. They have been a&s;&s;umed by fraud, or violence; or through a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages, have been &s;uffered to accumulate in certain families, and become &s;acred in their hands. Thus the powers of govern|ment came to be con&s;idered, as the right and privilege of the rulers, inherent, di&s;|tinct, and paramount to the rights of the people. Men have conducted as though whatever of right, whatever of good was enjoyed, by the &s;ubject, was to be derived from the conde&s;cen&s;ion of rulers, a mere conce&s;&s;ion of clemency. Doctrines like the&s;e have, in all ages, by the intere&s;ted po|licy of the ambiti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">us few, been artfully, and but too &s;ucce&s;sfully inculcated on the people. From this &s;ource has been deriv|ed
<PB N="114" REF="025297_0113_0FCCF43C43E88CA0">
the doctrine, of the pre&s;ent perfection of government, the infallibility of rulers, and the divine right of Kings.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the people, from a dread of the horrid oppre&s;&s;ion, which uni|ver&s;ally, accompanies &s;uch ab&s;urd concep|tions of power, have, at times, plunged into the extremes of anarchy and popular violence. They have been driven to a feeling, rather than a rational inve&s;tigation of their rights. They have found it diffi|cult to di&s;tingui&s;h clearly, in the exerci&s;e of power, between a per&s;onal right, and a mere betru&s;tment. They have found it &s;till more difficult to e&s;tabli&s;h any laws of accountability, which might operate to prevent a con&s;tant abu&s;e, without a con|&s;tant re&s;ort to violent mea&s;ures. Thus embarra&s;&s;ed, they have frequently balanced between the horrors of tyranny, and the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of faction. Hence were ex|perienced, at Athens, at Rome, and in many other governments, perpetual vibra|tions between the violence of the rulers and the violence of the people.</P>
<P>Neither the Greeks nor the Romans had any accurate notions of liberty, and the natural rights of man; of tho&s;e rela|tions, from which re&s;ult the &s;acred laws of his nature. From the ignorance of their lawgivers in the&s;e points, which was, indeed,
<PB N="115" REF="025297_0114_0FCCF43D9669E658">
the ignorance of the age, there were always radical defects in their governments. In all their &s;y&s;tems, they made little or no di&s;tinction, between the laws of the con|&s;titution, by which the &s;tate is organized, and its efficient powers directed and limited, and the laws of property and per&s;onal rights. And yet, without a nice attention to this di&s;tinction, liberty can never be permanently &s;ecured.</P>
<P>An examination of the various con&s;ti|tutions of government, which have exi&s;ted, or &s;till do exi&s;t in the world, falls not di|rectly within my pre&s;ent plan. My de&s;ign is to attempt a &s;ketch, only, of the con&s;ti|tutional principles of government; as founded in the principles of natural law, in the moral and &s;ocial nature of man; and to point out the general operation and tendency of the&s;e principles in exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>Whenever men happen in &s;ociety, they, naturally, and from an unavoidable nece&s;|&s;ity, the nature of which has been ex|plained, fall into &s;ome kind of govern|ment. Nature, however, produces few things in perfection to man. Much is left to his choice, and the improvement of his rational powers. Whatever may have been the mode of originating and e&s;tabli&s;h|ing government, in the infancy of &s;ocieties, and of knowlege, it is now, in every free &amp;
<PB N="116" REF="025297_0115_0FCCF43F1A1FA328">
enlightened nation, admitted as fundamen|tal, that all legitimate government origin|ates in the free con&s;ent of the people; that to produce a rightful government, the peo|ple, among them&s;elves, mu&s;t enter into a mutual compact for that end. Not that we are to &s;uppo&s;e it nece&s;&s;ary to its validity, that each individual, in the propo&s;ed com|munity, &s;hould con&s;ent to every article of the compact. Men are by nature &s;ocial beings. In determining the mode, in which any people &s;hall enjoy the benefits of their &s;ocial nature, it is clearly a princi|ple of natural law, that, upon a fair di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion, the minority, if they choo&s;e to con|tinue within the limits of the &s;ociety, &s;hall be bound by the deci&s;ions of the majority.</P>
<P>In the exerci&s;e of this right of free con|&s;ent by the people, agreeably to the prin|ciples now laid down, con&s;titutions of gov|ernment are formed. The con&s;titution is no other than the fundamental laws made and ratified by &s;uch compact, for the pur|po&s;e of organizing the government, and e&s;tabli&s;hing the nece&s;&s;ary powers. The intent of the&s;e laws is to direct, in what manner, and to what end, the con&s;tituted powers &s;hall be exerci&s;ed; how tho&s;e, to whom the exerci&s;e is entru&s;ted, &s;hall be holden accountable; and to limit tho&s;e powers, by preci&s;ely marking the rights,
<PB N="117" REF="025297_0116_0FCCF4429ACCEA88">
which are inherent, and unalienable in the &s;ocial nature of man, the mutual enjoy|ment and exerci&s;e of which does not inter|fere with individual rights, or ob&s;truct the due exerci&s;e of the powers of government, for the common good. This has been found nece&s;&s;ary, not becau&s;e the people are pre&s;umed to have &s;ubmitted to the con&s;ti|tuted powers every right, not expre&s;ly re|&s;erved, but becau&s;e it has been found diffi|cult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to mark the powers them&s;elves, with preci&s;e, unequivocal li|mits.</P>
<P>The laws of the con&s;titution, as Mr. Paine has ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, are to the govern|ment what the laws made by the govern|ment, that is the civil laws, are to a court of judicature. A court of judicature is bound by the laws, but has not the power, either to make or alter them. In like manner, the government, that is, tho&s;e or|ganized bodies, who are entru&s;ted with the powers of government, are bound by the con&s;titution, but have no power, in them|&s;elves, to make, alter, or control, any of its laws.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ity of laws, for the happy re|gulation of &s;ocial and civil intercour&s;e, has already been ob&s;erved. In a &s;cene, where there is a complication of rights, to be re|conciled and &s;ecured, a great variety of
<PB N="118" REF="025297_0117_0FCCF44616A1D6A8">
pa&s;&s;ions, to to be re&s;trained and directed, the nece&s;&s;ity of con&s;titutional laws, agree|ably to which the powers of government &s;hall be exerci&s;ed, are no le&s;s obviou&s;ly nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The con&s;titutional laws ought to have a certain relation to the laws of na|ture, and to be founded in principles deri|ved &s;olely from tho&s;e laws. From the &s;ame &s;ource are to be derived the opera|tive principles, of the con&s;tituted powers, and tho&s;e principles, by which they are limited, re&s;trained, and directed to the ends of their in&s;titution. To give activity to the&s;e powers, the con&s;titution ought to de&s;ignate, not the per&s;ons, who &s;hall be en|tru&s;ted with the exerci&s;e, but the mode of their appointment, and in what manner they &s;hall be amenable for their conduct in the admini&s;tration. From the manner in which the con&s;tituted powers are exer|ci&s;ed, and the immediate objects of their exertion, naturally ari&s;es a divi&s;ion into a legi&s;lative, executive, and judiciary. It is the bu&s;ine&s;s of the legi&s;lative to form &s;uch laws as may, in a due proportion, di|rect the actions of the whole, to the pur|&s;uit of public mea&s;ures, and intere&s;ts; as may unite the forces of the community, and direct them to the attainment of tho&s;e important objects of public utility, or pub|lic
<PB N="119" REF="025297_0118_0FCCF449EBE0D960">
nece&s;&s;ity, to which the united force of the whole is alone adequate.

<P>MOST of the political writers of mo|dern times, who have had any idea of a free government, have contended for a divi&s;ion of the legi&s;lative power. They would have, in the legi&s;lature, one body of men, repre&s;enting the commonalty; a &s;enate, repre&s;enting the wealthy and more honor|able part of the community, and the head of the executive, whether King, Pre&s;ident, or Governor, repre&s;enting the individuality or &s;overeignty of the &s;tate. The&s;e bodies,
<PB N="128" REF="025297_0127_0FCCF45B47010B88">
for the purpo&s;e of maintaining an exact balance of the &s;everal intere&s;ts in the &s;tate, are to have a mutual negative in pa&s;&s;ing all laws. The balance is to be &s;upported, and the happine&s;s of the people &s;ecured, by a mutual oppo&s;ition of rights, intere&s;ts, and powers.</P>
<P>Before we proceed to the head of <HI>Elec|tions,</HI> let us attend, carefully, to examine this point.</P>
<P>To admit the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a balance, is to admit, that the laws of nature have indulged to certain cla&s;&s;es of men different rights, and given them di&s;tinct intere&s;ts in tho&s;e rights, and that the maintenance of &s;uch rights, and intere&s;ts, di&s;tinct, and in|violable, is indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to the happine&s;s of the whole. This po&s;ition is, upon our principles, wholly inadmi&s;&s;ible. There are, indeed, inequalities among men. Some are &s;tronger than others. Some have greater powers of mind. Hence proceeds an inequality of acqui&s;itions, both in power, and in property. The &s;trong have it in their power to trample on the weak; the cunning, to circumvent the &s;imple. But will any one pretend that they have a right to do this? The rights of acqui&s;ition are equal and common to all. The laws of natural ju&s;tice have laid it under this re&s;tri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion, &s;o u&s;e your own

If the law &s;hould give him a monopoly of riches, of power, of honor, and &s;ecure them to him in perpe|tuity, again&s;t my claims of ju&s;tice and of merit, it would be a diminution, an unju&s;t violation of my right. The&s;e are the dar|ling principles of monarchy and ari&s;tocra|cy. Men are capable of the&s;e principles. They are capable of many vices. The former contribute no more to perfection in government, than the latter in moral conduct. It is, &s;urely, much better, in the formation of a government, to prevent their very germination, than to maintain a con&s;tant &s;truggle again&s;t their evil tend|ency.</P>
<P>In Great-Britain, the balance of power, in three branches, pre&s;erves, what of liberty is to be found among the people. That government con&s;i&s;ts of a monarchy, an ari&s;tocracy, and a democracy: that is, two powers, with di&s;tinct, and exclu&s;ive rights. The&s;e rights, as far as they are claimed to extend, place the claimants beyond the
<PB N="130" REF="025297_0129_0FCCF45FA95DC090">
reach of one branch of the laws of nature, the law of accountability to man. If the&s;e orders have been e&s;tabli&s;hed in a &s;tate, and are to be &s;upported, they mu&s;t be placed in an equal balance. Power mu&s;t be op|po&s;ed to power; authority to equal author|ity, as a mean of &s;elf-defence in each. The prerogative of the crown, and the pri|vileges of the nobles, are ingro&s;&s;ments on the rights of the people. They are heredi|tary, and deemed to be inherent in the very blood. Their honors, their privileges, and their crimes, as rulers, and as men, are held to be above the judgment of the people. The powers of the monarch, and of the nobles, which are exerci&s;ed upon the &s;ame &s;ubject, the people, often interfere. The re&s;traint of one, is the enlargement of the other. Both are equally out of nature. It is rightly con&s;idered as a matter of in|difference to the people, who has the exer|ci&s;e. Their claims of right and of power are placed in oppo&s;ition; and mutual en|mity is the natural con&s;equence. Every compromi&s;e of their intere&s;ts, every tempo|rary union of their powers, is a con&s;piracy again&s;t the people; who, at times, are ju&s;tly provoked to a&s;&s;ert their injured rights, again&s;t the u&s;urpations of both. As the rights of the monarch, and of the nobles, are ho&s;tile to the rights of the people, the

Each party, in rotation, unites with its enemy, for mu|tual defence again&s;t a more powerful ene|my.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of the Engli&s;h government, from William the Conqueror, down to the pre&s;ent time, is an inconte&s;tible proof of the&s;e truths. It is little more than the hi&s;tory of the u&s;urpation of the king, and the nobles, upon the rights of the people; &s;truggles between the king and the nobles, for the greate&s;t &s;hare in the u&s;urpation, and the oppo&s;ition of the people to both. What a &s;cene of treachery, faction, and all the horrors of civil war, the legitimate off-&s;pring of &s;uch a government, does their hi&s;|tory con&s;tantly exhibit to our view! From the improvement of the &s;ocial virtues, the&s;e conte&s;ts have, indeed, lo&s;t much of their ferocity. They have a&s;&s;umed a milder tone. What was formerly attempted by open violence, is now effected by the more &s;ilent, though not le&s;s fatal means of cor|ruption. It is, as the pe&s;tilence that walk|eth in darkne&s;s &s;ucceeding to the de&s;truction which wa&s;teth at noonday.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="025297_0131_0FCCF4630B143268">The democratic branch, the repre&s;enta|tives of the people, are the depo&s;itory, and from their intere&s;t, the &s;ole guardians of the rights of the people. But with the&s;e, from a fatality attending the nature of the government, and the frailty of human na|ture, temptations to betray their tru&s;t, and to de&s;ert to the enemies of the people, too often prevail. Fal&s;e notions of greatne&s;s, univer&s;ally adopted; hope of ri&s;ing to the higher orders; and the de&s;ire of riches, which are the nece&s;&s;ary &s;caffolding of fal&s;e greatne&s;s, open wide the door to corrup|tion.

<P>It has long been a &s;ubject of wonder to the philo&s;opher, and a matter of triumph to the friends of de&s;poti&s;m, that tho&s;e writers, who have gone farthe&s;t in their re|&s;earches into the nature of man, and in di&s;covering the true principles of civil and religious liberty, have found their theories incapable of being reduced to practice, in new e&s;tabli&s;hments.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="025297_0132_0FCCF465805989E0">Locke, who was one of the fir&s;t philo|&s;ophers of his age, and the champion of liberty, was employed by the Lords Pro|prietors of Carolina, to form the plan of a con&s;titution for their government. Though the friend of liberty, and of mankind, he had conceived no idea of any other &s;ecurity to the enjoyment of liberty, than what was to be found in the con&s;titution of England. He &s;eems not to have reflected, that here|ditary prejudices, in favor of ancient cu&s;|toms, and even of ancient names: a habit of thinking and acting in a certain train, in mea&s;ures, to which men are familiari&s;ed, render tho&s;e things ea&s;y, in an e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, venerable for its antiquity, which are utterly impracticable in new in&s;titutions. He, therefore, with a view of e&s;tabli&s;hing and &s;ecuring that liberty, which he e&s;teem|ed the greate&s;t happine&s;s of a government, created an oppo&s;ition of powers and inte|re&s;ts under names and titles, different from tho&s;e, to which the people had been accu&s;|tomed in England. The Lords Proprie|tors were the Sovereign; the newly creat|ed Nobility con&s;tituted an hereditary Hou&s;e of Peers, and the people had their Repre|&s;entatives in a Hou&s;e of Commons.</P>

which habit had annexed a degree of vene|ration, had an influence to prevent their attaining any portion of that dignity, which the Peerage, under the &s;hadow of the Mo|narch, enjoy in England. In this new &s;ituation, the oppo&s;ition of intere&s;t, which had been e&s;tabli&s;hed, in&s;tead of proving a &s;ecurity to liberty, produced nothing but violent animo&s;ity among the contending parties, and a grievous oppre&s;&s;ion of the people. The event &s;oon di&s;covered the &s;y&s;tem to be out of nature, and wholly im|practicable in its operation. Had Locke been fully acquainted with the laws of ac|countability, and the means of giving them effect in the admini&s;tration of government, would he have fallen into &s;uch impractica|ble ab&s;urdities, in his con&s;titution of Caro|lina?

a government founded in violence, and &s;upported by oppo&s;ition. The hi&s;tory of Athens, of Sparta, of Rome, and of many of the more modern &s;tates, exhibits the bulk of mankind in this character. A few men have ari&s;en in every nation, great be|yond their age, the in&s;truments of Provid|ence for the improvement of the world. To the&s;e, modern times are indebted for the fir&s;t dawnings of &s;cience. As the be|nefactors of mankind, their names will be had in perpetual remembrance; but the hi&s;tory of their times informs us, that they were able to communicate little of their knowlege to the body of the people; to moderate the pa&s;&s;ions, or to influence, in any con&s;iderable degree, the general &s;enti|ment. The governments of tho&s;e times were as ill balanced, as the pa&s;&s;ions of the people, and for the &s;ame rea&s;on. People, in &s;uch a &s;tate, are keenly &s;en&s;ible of the pre&s;ent. They are, in general, little capa|ble of adju&s;ting combinations, or of di&s;co|vering any, but the mo&s;t obvious relations and tendencies. From the character of tho&s;e times, we have rea&s;on to conclude, that the violence of government, and the violence of the people, who often de&s;troy|ed one &s;et of tyrants, to make room for another, and were often guilty of greater abu&s;es, than tho&s;e, which they attempted

It proceeded from a want of knowlege, from the violence of the pa&s;&s;ions and appetites, the weakne&s;s of the moral &s;en&s;e, and con&s;equently the &s;en&s;e of accountability, which rendered it difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to fix any &s;uffi|cient barrier again&s;t the tyranny of rulers, or the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the people. Cer|tainly, arguments, drawn from &s;uch a &s;tate of &s;ociety, and of manners, in favor of a balance, con&s;tituted by an oppo&s;ition of powers and intere&s;ts, ought, with caution, to be applied to the pre&s;ent &s;tate; which is, in &s;o many re&s;pects, very widely diffe|rent.</P>
<P>At this day, great improvements in &s;ci|ence, in manners, and in morals, have tak|en place. The art of Printing has rendered the means of diffu&s;ing knowlege, almo&s;t univer&s;al. Science is no longer confined to the reclu&s;e. U&s;eful knowlege, and u&s;eful &s;cience, are attainable by the ma&s;s of the people. Improvements have litte|rally begotten improvements. The know|lege of many things, which, in former times, was the fruit of long and laborious application, is now imbibed almo&s;t with the milk in infancy. Many an ancient &s;age, in the warmth of his philanthropy, would have exulted, could he have fore|&s;een,
<PB N="137" REF="025297_0136_0FCCF46B64B1A188">
that in America, and in many na|tions of Europe, the plain hu&s;bandman would, at this day, po&s;&s;e&s;s more knowlege, applicable in human life, more u&s;eful &s;ci|ence, than was to be found in all the &s;chools of antiquity.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of imperfection, the abu&s;e of power will never be wholly prevented; but, when the idea of inherent powers, ex|clu&s;ive rights, and &s;eparate intere&s;ts, &s;hall, in the mode of betru&s;tment, and the con|duct required of rulers, be no longer &s;ug|ge&s;ted to their minds, temptations to abu&s;e will be, in a great mea&s;ure, removed.</P>
<P>A frequent rotation in all the offices of government, has, by &s;ome &s;tate&s;men, of no incon&s;iderable authority, been e&s;teemed one of the mo&s;t effectual provi&s;ions again&s;t an abu&s;e of power. The advocates for this in&s;titution urge, that a rotation in offices has a powerful tendency to prevent the danger, which con&s;tantly ari&s;es from an inveterate habit in the exerci&s;e of power, in any man, family, or &s;et of men, on the one hand, and the habit, which the people, on the other, are too prone to acquire, of directing their obedience to particular men or families, rather than to the laws and or|dinances of government; that the&s;e habits become inveterate, in any way, are not &s;ufficiently checked by the frequency of

elections, and always counteract the true principles of a repre&s;entative republic. The experiment, though often made in the republics of ancient Greece, and of modern Italy, has never &s;ucceeded in preventing the abu&s;e of power. On the contrary, an e&s;tabli&s;hed rotation of offices has &s;erved rather to increa&s;e the rapacity of rulers, and to render the government but the more in|&s;upportable. The rea&s;ons of this effect, I think, are obvious. Where a rotation is e&s;tabli&s;hed, there frequently will, in tho&s;e, who are brought forward to office, be di&s;|covered the want of a thorough knowlege of the bu&s;ine&s;s of their tru&s;t, and a want of dexterity, which is unavoidable to per&s;ons in new employments. But this is of le&s;s importance.</P>
<P>An intere&s;t in the approbation of the people, and a &s;trong &s;en&s;e of accountability to them, in all official conduct is the great|e&s;t, or rather, the only effectual &s;ecurity again&s;t abu&s;es in tho&s;e, who exerci&s;e the powers of government. An in&s;titution, agreeably to which the greate&s;t wi&s;dom, the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed patrioti&s;m, the highe&s;t integrity of conduct in a ruler, cannot en|title him to the proper reward of his virtue, an expre&s;&s;ion of the approbation of his fel|low citizens, in his re-election to office, dimini&s;hes the mo&s;t flattering intere&s;t, which

he ought to have in their favor, and in the &s;ame degree relaxes his &s;en&s;e of accounta|bility to the tribunal of public &s;entiment. His intere&s;t is &s;een diverted into another channel. He no longer looks for a public reward, but hopes, either, that his crimes may e&s;cape detection, or that his rapacity and acts of oppre&s;&s;ion will furni&s;h the means of &s;tifling future enquiry. An enquiry will &s;oon be found to be pur&s;ued with le&s;s zeal, among a &s;et of people, who, while they &s;ucceed to the &s;ame offices, &s;ucceed to the &s;ame views, and the &s;ame intere&s;ts. In a repre&s;entative republic, every in&s;titution ought to be avoided, which has a tendency to deprive the citizens of a right of employ|ing, at their election, except in ca&s;es of pre&s;ent incompatibility, in offices, men of known abilities, and experienced integrity, or which tends to dimini&s;h in the rulers, a &s;trong &s;en&s;e of accountability, a perpetual intere&s;t in the approbation of the people.</P>
<P>Truth is but one. Errors are infinite. The knowlege of truth tends to unanimity of &s;entiment. Errors tend to endle&s;s divi|&s;ions and factions. Bani&s;h my&s;tery from politics; open every channel of informa|tion; call for inve&s;tigation; tempt a di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion of mea&s;ures, and the public &s;enti|ment will be the be&s;t criterion of what is right, and what is wrong in government.

<P>THE exerci&s;e of the legi&s;lative power by repre&s;entation, is an improvement of modern times. In all the republics of an|cient Greece, and in Rome it&s;elf, where the citizens had a &s;hare in legi&s;lation, every freeman was a member of the legi&s;lature, &amp; gave his &s;uffrage per&s;onally, in the great a&s;&s;emblies of the people. This brought together a body too unwieldy, even in the &s;malle&s;t &s;tates. In &s;tates of greater ex|tent,
<PB N="143" REF="025297_0142_0FCCF478FA445DD8">
where the citizens were almo&s;t innu|merable, with the peculiar manners, the limited knowlege, and partial views of their times, they formed a heterogeneous a&s;&s;emblage of &s;entiments, pa&s;&s;ions, and in|tere&s;ts, which bade defiance to all hope of compromi&s;e, by means of rational di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e, who are little conver&s;ant in rea|&s;oning, are yet capable of feeling. Ac|cordingly, we find, in the public har|rangues of their mo&s;t celebrated orators, and &s;tate&s;men, very little attention to in|ve&s;tigation. All their powers of elo|quence, were directed to the pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;entiments of the audience. The whole vigor of the &s;oul was collected to this point. The in&s;tructions contained in their public orations, &s;erves principally to mark the &s;tate of knowlege, the manners, and pub|lic &s;entiments of the times. The glow of imagination, which they di&s;cover; the propriety and irre&s;i&s;table force of &s;enti|ment and expre&s;&s;ion, which wraps the whole &s;oul in attention, have ju&s;tly rendered them the admiration of &s;ucceeding ages. All this well accounts for the fluctuation of mea&s;ures, in ancient popular govern|ments. They have often, and with pro|priety, been compared to fluctuations of the boi&s;terous element. A republican

government upon this model, mu&s;t, in a large &s;tate, be very inconvenient, and expo|&s;ed to perpetual revolutions.</P>
<P>It has been the opinion of many writers, that a democracy can be adequate only to the government of a &s;mall territory. They have held, that in this &s;pecies of govern|ment, population mu&s;t be &s;tinted, or the number of citizens, who have the right of &s;uffrage, limitted. The fir&s;t is a very di&s;|couraging con&s;ideration to &s;ociety. The latter con&s;titutes a more or le&s;s numerous ari&s;tocracy. Monte&s;quieu has adopted this opinion. He &s;eems not to have con|ceived, that a government purely demo|cratic, could act wholly by repre&s;entation. In his time, I believe an in&s;tance of this kind had not exi&s;ted in any independent &s;tate. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The colonial governments of Connecticut and Rhode-I&s;land, before the late revolution, were, in their internal admini&s;tration, pure repre&s;entative democracies.</NOTE></P>
<P>Speaking of the con&s;titution of England, the &s;ame author ob&s;erves, "The great advantage of repre&s;entatives, is, their being capable of di&s;cu&s;&s;ing affairs. For this, the people at large are very unfit, which is one of the greate&s;t inconveniencies of a democra|cy." Repre&s;entatives, cho&s;en from the various parts of the community, agreeably to a ju&s;t apportionment, are, not only, ca|pable
<PB N="145" REF="025297_0144_0FCCF47BCE3DEB78">
of di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the affairs of the nation, be it ever &s;o exten&s;ive or numerous, but they bring to the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion more know|lege of the general and particular manners, intere&s;ts, and &s;entiments of the people, who&s;e happine&s;s is alone concerned in their deliberations, and di&s;po&s;itions more conge|nial to tho&s;e manners, intere&s;ts and &s;enti|ments, than can be found in any other body of men.</P>
<P>The rights and intere&s;ts of monarchy and ari&s;tocracy, ever exclu&s;ive of the rights and intere&s;ts of the people, ever in oppo&s;i|tion, are not le&s;s &s;o in a large, than in a &s;mall &s;tate. In a large &s;tate, the objects of their oppre&s;&s;ions and exactions are more numerous, and may, &s;ometimes, by dividing, le&s;&s;en the burden. But whether the &s;tate be great or &s;mall, the &s;ame exclu&s;ive rights, the &s;ame oppo&s;ition of intere&s;ts, the &s;ame oppre&s;&s;ions, and exactions, exi&s;t in kind.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing to be con&s;idered, in forming a legi&s;lative body, is the qualifica|tions of electors, and the number and qua|lifications of repre&s;entatives. The&s;e are not points of ea&s;y di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. They have never been preci&s;ely determined. Some have in&s;i&s;ted on a qualification in property. Others have extended the right of &s;uffrage and of eligibility, to every acknowleged citizen.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="025297_0145_0FCCF47E34EEB090">In a democratic republic, in which every thing ought to tend to a certain kind of equality, property &s;eems not to be a ju&s;t criterion. The individual and &s;ocial rights of man, are the &s;ubjects of legi&s;lative di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion, and to the&s;e, the intere&s;ts of the community are to be referred. The right of property is one of tho&s;e rights, and gives ri&s;e to a very exten&s;ive intere&s;t among men. It is a right, however, which, if it meet a too partial indulgence, tends to a danger|ous inequality of influence, and with the power and intere&s;t, &s;ugge&s;ts to the proprie|tor the idea of infringing the rights of others with impunity. The intere&s;t of &s;cience, of indu&s;try, of commerce, and of the mechanic arts, have an equal claim on &s;ociety. The proper encouragement of the&s;e, tends to a more equal di&s;tribution of the goods of fortune, and to correct the unequal influence of wealth. In a &s;tate where, through the prevalence of corrupt principles, the whole property is accumu|lated, and perpetuated in the hands of a few; where the great ma&s;s of the people are reduced to a &s;tate of dependence, &s;er|vility, and meanne&s;s, from which they can never hope to emerge, but by the de&s;truc|tion of their oppre&s;&s;ors, a general right of &s;uffrage, would be dangerous to the few, and for a time, even to the people them|&s;elves.

In mo&s;t, if not all the governments of the United States of America, where the law equally regards the rights of the rich and the poor; where few are to be found without property, and fewer &s;till without a well grounded hope of obtaining it; where indu&s;try and economy rarely fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l to procure a competence, and often lead to opulence, no ill con&s;equences are to be feared from a general right of &s;uf|frage.</P>
<P>Di&s;qualifications will, however, in &s;ome ca&s;es, be found nece&s;&s;ary. It will, at lea&s;t, be found expedient to exclude, both from the right of &s;uffrage, and eligibility, tho&s;e, who, for want of age, may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be wanting in di&s;cretion. Certainly the intere&s;ts of virtue and of the public require, that tho&s;e &s;hould be excluded, who, by their crimes, have manife&s;ted a di&s;po&s;ition totally corrupt, and by their conduct declared to the world, that they are no longer to be tru&s;ted.</P>
<P>I am unable to per&s;uade my&s;elf, that any di&s;tinction, in point of qualifications, ought to be made, between electors and candi|dates. I &s;ay in general, for a di&s;tinction of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ge, which to abilities adds experience and maturity of judgment, may well be admit|ed.

mankind, to a certain degree, with a con|&s;cious approbation of virtue. Other qua|lifications are mo&s;tly invidious. They in|troduce, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, a di&s;tinction of cla&s;&s;es. They excite a degree of haughti|ne&s;s in the candidates. The electors feel them&s;elves degraded, and that their cla&s;s, notwith&s;tanding their right of &s;uffrage, is unrepre&s;ented. If a character for integrity and abilities are the only qualifications for a candidate, they will be more affiduou&s;ly cultivated. The&s;e are qualifications, which alone are u&s;eful to the people, and of the&s;e the people are the only competent judges. The choice of a worthy character, reflects honor upon them&s;elves, which they enjoy with the more &s;atisfaction, as they are &s;en|&s;ible of no re&s;traint or limitation in their choice. From the&s;e con&s;iderations, I ap|prehend, that the right of &s;uffrage and of eligibility ought to be the &s;ame, and limited by no qualification but that of age. If, in any &s;tate, other qualifications &s;hall be found nece&s;&s;ary in either, the nece&s;&s;ity mu&s;t have ari&s;en from &s;ome antecedent defect in the con&s;titution and laws.</P>
<P>The number of repre&s;entatives &s;eems le&s;s capable of a preci&s;e limitation. The ex|tremes are very di&s;cernible, but they are very di&s;tant. Too numerous a repre&s;enta|tion verges towards the inconvenience of

an a&s;&s;embly of the people.

On the other hand, if the repre&s;entative body are too few in number, their mea&s;ures are liable to be dictated by limitted views and partial inte|re&s;ts. Po&s;&s;ibly we can go no farther than to &s;ay, that it ought to be &s;ufficiently nu|merous to probably comprehend all the pa&s;&s;ions, &s;entiments, and intere&s;ts, which have a national influence.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations apply equally to the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives and the Senate. The better to equalize the repre&s;entation for the Hou&s;e, the State ought to be divid|ed into as many di&s;tricts as there are re|pre&s;entatives to be cho&s;en. Where no lo|cal, or more powerful rea&s;on oppo&s;es &s;uch divi&s;ion, the di&s;tricts &s;hould be apportioned by the number of inhabitants. This will, in general, give the mo&s;t equal repre&s;enta|tion of intere&s;ts. The voters too will act under&s;tandingly, and with a per&s;onal know|lege of the candidates. Where a number of repre&s;entatives are a&s;&s;igned to a di&s;trict of greater extent, every engine of intrigue is commonly put in motion and the repre|&s;entatives
<PB N="150" REF="025297_0149_0FCCF487D5A6E478">
are cho&s;en, by the prevailing in|tere&s;t of the di&s;trict, to the exclu&s;ion of every other intere&s;t. The mode of election propo&s;ed for the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, gives opportunity for an advantageous modification in the election of a Senate. The Senators are to be repre&s;entatives of the people, no le&s;s, in fact, than the mem|bers of the other hou&s;e. It is a very good idea, that the Senate &s;hall be con&s;idered as a national council. This &s;ugge&s;ts a di&s;|tinction of age, to give maturity to their deliberations. Public mea&s;ures, before they are adopted, ought to be con&s;idered in every point of light, in which they can affect the pa&s;&s;ions, the morals, &s;entiments, and intere&s;ts of the community, both gen|eral and particular. While they provide for pre&s;ent accommodation, they ought not to lo&s;e &s;ight of future improvements. To &s;ecure a more deliberate di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and a more calm inve&s;tigation, not only ought the warmth and inexperience of youth to be excluded from the Senate, but the mem|bers &s;hould be fewer in number, than tho&s;e of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives.

by the firm compo&s;ure of the Senate. In proportion as they are fewer in number, they will be cho&s;en by larger di&s;tricts. This will produce a different combination of the intere&s;ts, which they repre&s;ent, and exhibit a different and more collected view of the objects of legi&s;lation.</P>
<P>To prevent, in the members of the legi&s;|lature, every idea of an independent power, or of property in their appointments, they mu&s;t be cho&s;en for a limited time.

The period mu&s;t be &s;ufficiently long for completing the ordinary rotine of bu&s;ine&s;s. A year may, in general, be the mo&s;t convenient time. Perhaps, in larger &s;tates, the nature of the ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s, the magnitude of the objects which demand the attention of the legi&s;latures, and the &s;ubjects to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, may require a longer period. Rea&s;ons may likewi&s;e exi&s;t for fixing different periods for the members of the Senate, and the members of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives. In each, &s;ome period ought to be fixed, beyond the power of the Legi&s;lature to alter. Such a provi|&s;ion will, on every occa&s;ion, recall their attention to the intere&s;ts and happine&s;s of the

<P>To render the public &s;entiment a more rational, and a more powerful check upon every department of government, it is e&s;|&s;ential, that there be, in the con&s;titution of every free &s;tate, an effectual provi&s;ion for the di&s;&s;emination of u&s;eful knowlege. No knowlege can be more u&s;eful to a people, than that, which enables them to manage, or, at lea&s;t, to judge, with propriety, of their own and the public intere&s;ts. "Let liberty be attended with knowlege." It removes the temptation to abu&s;e, by taking away the hope of &s;ucce&s;sful impo&s;ition. To this end, common &s;chools, as well as public &s;eminaries, &s;hould be con&s;idered as an important object of legi&s;lative attention.

<HEAD><HI>SECTION V.</HI> Of the appointment and accountability of the Executive and Judiciary.</HEAD>
<P>THE executive is the ultimately effici|ent power in government. For the &s;ake of di&s;patch, of unity of action, and of rep|re&s;enting the individuality of the &s;tate, in tran&s;actions with other nations, this power ought to be ve&s;ted in one per&s;on, whom, for di&s;tinction, we will call the Pre&s;ident.</P>
<P>Some have thought, that the election of the Pre&s;ident might, with the greate&s;t &s;afety, be entru&s;ted to the Legi&s;lature. Others have held, that it &s;hould be the &s;acred right of the people. There are un|an&s;werable objections to the exerci&s;e of this right by the Legi&s;lature. It gives an idea of dependence of the Pre&s;ident on the Legi&s;lature, and intercepts his account|ability to the people. All elections by the repre&s;entative body, are liable to in|trigues and coalitions, which greatly in|fluence public mea&s;ures. This evil is encrea&s;ed, in proportion to the importance of the election.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="025297_0153_0FCCF49031D29F98">An upright di&s;charge of the duties of the executive, is the mo&s;t honorable of a|ny in the &s;tate; an abu&s;e the mo&s;t danger|ous, and in none, are the temptations &s;o powerful. It ought, therefore, to be guarded again&s;t with every rational check. At the &s;ame time, it mu&s;t not be &s;o in|cumbered as to clogg its nece&s;&s;ary activity. The good or bad conduct of the executive is, in mo&s;t in&s;tances of internal admini&s;|tration, immediately felt by the people. To prevent any hurtful coalition, between the executive and the legi&s;lative body, and to &s;ubject the Pre&s;ident to the controul of public &s;entiment, his appointment &s;hould be by periodical elections of the people. In more exten&s;ive and complicated gov|ernments &s;uch as that of the United States, this mode of electing the Pre&s;ident, may be inconvenient, or even impracticable. When this &s;hall appear, &s;ome other pro|vi&s;ion mu&s;t be made; but care mu&s;t be ta|ken, to prevent all legi&s;lative interference, in the appointments, unle&s;s, which will &s;ometimes happen, no choice &s;hall have been made, in the mode pre&s;cribed, and to make it depend as much as po&s;&s;ible, on the &s;entiments of the people.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s of the executive, is too ex|ten&s;ive and various to be performed by one man. Many of its duties mu&s;t be per|formed
<PB N="155" REF="025297_0154_0FCCF491AFB63FA8">
by &s;ubordinate Mini&s;ters, who are to be con&s;idered as a&s;&s;i&s;tants to the Pre&s;i|dent. The appointment of the&s;e proper|ly falls within his province. He will be re&s;pon&s;ible to the public, for their charac|ter and abilities, though not for their crimes. He ought, therefore, ordinarily, to be entru&s;ted with their removal.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the duties of the executive, al|ready mentioned, there are other duties, very nece&s;&s;ary to an orderly and economi|cal arrangement of public mea&s;ures. It will, at all times, be the duty of the Pre&s;|ident, to inform the Legi&s;lature of the &s;ituation of public affairs, of the event of mea&s;ures, which have been adopted, and to recommend to their con&s;ideration tho&s;e &s;ubjects, which demand their more imme|diate, or more particular attention.</P>
<P>According to the ordinary rotine of of|ficial bu&s;ine&s;s, it will be the duty of the &s;ubordinate Mini&s;ters of the executive, when required by the Legi&s;lature, to give a clear and ju&s;t account of the affairs of their &s;everal departments, to make proper arrangements in tho&s;e matters, which are committed to their charge, and to accom|pany them with all the nece&s;&s;ary informa|tion, which may a&s;&s;i&s;t that body to adopt and pur&s;ue a regular &s;y&s;tem, in their inter|nal economy, and to conduct with propri|ety
<PB N="156" REF="025297_0155_0FCCF493F640DEC8">
and good faith, as well toward indi|vidual citizens, as in their intercour&s;e with foreign powers.</P>
<P>Happily for mankind, it has been found that the exerci&s;e of the executive power, is &s;ufficiently capable of preci&s;e limitation, by known and e&s;tabli&s;hed laws. Its Min|i&s;ters may, therefore, be &s;ubjected to tri|al, before a con&s;tituent tribunal, to remo|val and puni&s;hment, for male-admini&s;tra|tion. Impunity &s;hould, on no account, be annexed to office or dignity, So far from con&s;i&s;ting with the good of the commu|nity, it is directly oppo&s;ed to its intere&s;t and &s;afety. A &s;trict adherence to the&s;e principles, in the con&s;titution and admin|i&s;tration of government, will &s;ecure as great a check upon the abu&s;e of power, as the imperfection of human in&s;titutions will admit. It cannot be too often inculcated, that, to indulge, or rather to create an op|po&s;ition of intere&s;ts, on which to found an oppo&s;ition of powers, will, if we may rely on the experience of the pre&s;ent and pa&s;t ages, always prove ineffectual to the end of re&s;traint, and in a greater or le&s;s degree, &s;uber&s;ive of the rights and liberties of the people.</P>
<P>An executive council, who&s;e advice may a&s;&s;i&s;t the Pre&s;ident, in matters of general importance, or doubtful i&s;&s;ue, appears to
<PB N="157" REF="025297_0156_0FCCF495531A80C0">
be a wi&s;e and nece&s;&s;ary in&s;titution. From this council, the members of the judiciary are carefully to be excluded. For this ex|clu&s;ion there are two &s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;ons. The fir&s;t has already been mentioned; the nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;eparation between the le|gi&s;lative, executive, and judiciary, that each may be rendered di&s;tinctly accounta|ble. The &s;econd is, that their advice will pre-occupy que&s;tions concerning the legal and con&s;titutional rights of the citizens, in which the admini&s;tration of the execu|tive may be involved, and of which, in their official capacity, they are the only proper judges for redre&s;s.</P>
<P>There are nearly &s;imilar rea&s;ons again&s;t the admi&s;&s;ion of either branch, or any member of the Legi&s;lature, to this coun|cil. The objections are, that it blends tho&s;e powers, which, as we have &s;een, ought to be kept di&s;tinctly &s;eparate. It &s;hifts the re&s;pon&s;ibility from one to the other, and leaves it le&s;s clear, who is to be accountable. It is of importance, that there &s;hould be an enquiry into the con|duct of public officers; that pro&s;ecutions &s;hould be brought forward again&s;t the guilty; and that there &s;hould, &s;omewhere, exi&s;t a con&s;titutional court for their trial. The enquiry, pro&s;ecution, and trial, ought, from their importance to the community,
<PB N="158" REF="025297_0157_0FCCF496D88177D0">
and the character and &s;ituation of the par|ties, to be more public and &s;olemn, than tho&s;e, which are e&s;tabli&s;hed in the ca&s;e of common offenders. The National Repre|&s;entatives have been thought the mo&s;t proper board to in&s;titute &s;uch enquiry, and to bring forward the accu&s;ations of the public; and the Senate the mo&s;t proper court for the trial of &s;uch accu&s;ations. Though this appears not perfectly con&s;i&s;t|ent; yet probably no better provi&s;ion can be made. The introduction of an inde|pendent tribunal, for the trial of impeach|ments, would have greater inconveniences, and lead to endle&s;s con&s;equences. If &s;uch be the provi&s;ion for the accu&s;ation and trial of executive officers, certainly it is not very con&s;i&s;tent, that the &s;ame men, or the &s;ame body of men, &s;hould advi&s;e, and afterwards, on trial, decide upon the con|duct, which had been adopted and pur&s;ued in con&s;equence of their advice. It will of|ten be proper for the Legi&s;lature to advi&s;e and direct the Executive to the pur&s;uit of &s;ome national mea&s;ures, which may be ne|ce&s;&s;ary, or expedient. Their previous ap|probation may give weight to the mea&s;ures, and a facility to the execution. This ad|vice, however, &s;hould be general, or, in matters, which are con&s;idered as di&s;cre|tionary, with the Executive. It &s;hould ne|ver
<PB N="159" REF="025297_0158_0FCCF49B9E977F48">
extend to tho&s;e particular in&s;tances of conduct, which may become the ground of an impeachment. Upon the&s;e con&s;i|derations, would it not, if an Executive Council be nece&s;&s;ary, be more con&s;i&s;tent, that it &s;hould be compo&s;ed of a di&s;tinct bo|dy, elected in the &s;ame manner as the Pre|&s;ident, and in like manner amenable for their conduct?</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of the Judges, or Mini&s;ters of the Judiciary department, is &s;omewhat different from that of the others. The integrity of their conduct has a great influ|ence upon government. It is indi&s;pen&s;i|bly nece&s;&s;ary to an impartial admini&s;tration of law, and the &s;ecurity of public and pri|vate rights. Their deci&s;ions are, mo&s;tly, local, and of individual rights; but the precedents e&s;tabli&s;hed by their deci&s;ions, become general rules for the interpretation and application of the laws, which follow the principles of the government. In re|publican governments, the law is to be in|terpreted, with a &s;pirit of equity, impartial|ity, and moderation.</P>
<P>In the mode of performing the duties of the Legi&s;lative and Judiciary, there is a very material difference. In making laws, a great regard mu&s;t be had to the circum|&s;tances, manners, and &s;entiments of the people, as well as to the principles of the con&s;ti|tution.
<PB N="160" REF="025297_0159_0FCCF49D86CCA578">
The laws mu&s;t be the be&s;t, which the people can bear. In judging, whether between individuals of the people, or be|tween private per&s;ons and public officers, a &s;trict regard is to be had to the very right and ju&s;tice of the ca&s;e, agreeably to the principles of the con&s;titution, and the laws of the land. The Judges ought not to &s;tand in awe of the frowns of power, or to be influenced by temporary &s;miles of popular favor. The abilities, integrity, and independence of the Judges, is a &s;hield, both to the rulers, and to the people. They give a &s;teady nerve to the mild ener|gy of government, and ultimate &s;ecurity to private rights. That kind of accounta|bility, therefore, which is &s;upported by po|pular elections, and which is proper for the members of the Legi&s;lature, is not proper for a Judge. From the intere&s;t, which men of property and influence might ex|pect in future deci&s;ions, the people would, in the choice, be liable to be mi&s;lead in their judgment of characters. The &s;ame ob&s;ervations will hold of a legi&s;lative ap|pointment, in addition to what was above ob&s;erved of elections, in general, by the Legi&s;lature, that they give ri&s;e to intrigues and coalitions hurtful to public mea&s;ures. In popular appointments, no one holds him&s;elf re&s;pon&s;ible for the character of the
<PB N="161" REF="025297_0160_0FCCF49EF1742418">
per&s;on appointed. In the Legi&s;lature, re|&s;pon&s;ibility is, in a great degree, lo&s;t among numbers.</P>
<P>The appointment, or at lea&s;t the public nomination, of the Judges, ought to be entru&s;ted to the Pre&s;ident, or the head of the executive. His conduct is con&s;tantly, and &s;ingly, expo&s;ed to the public view. He will hold him&s;elf fully re&s;pon&s;ible for the character and abilities of tho&s;e, whom he appoints to office.</P>
<P>To &s;ecure them in that degree of inde|pendence, which &s;hall place them above the temptation of a bias, they &s;hould hold their office during good behaviour. Their &s;alaries &s;hould be fixed beyond the power of the Legi&s;lature to alter, at lea&s;t to di|mini&s;h, during their continuance in office. For corruption, or male-admini&s;tration in office, let them be liable to removal by impeachment in a con&s;titutional way.</P>
<P>There may, however, be &s;ome things, in the conduct of a Judge, which go to his character, and de&s;troy that re&s;pect and public confidence &s;o nece&s;&s;ary in &s;ecuring a ready acquie&s;cence in the deci&s;ion of the Judiciary, and a prompt obedience to the laws. They may, neverthele&s;s, be of &s;uch a nature, that they cannot be made the &s;ubject of an impeachment. To remedy this evil, which is, &s;ometimes, a matter of
<PB N="162" REF="025297_0161_0FCCF49FD1FC10A0">
great con&s;equence in government, and to impre&s;s on the minds of the Judges, a &s;en&s;e of the nece&s;&s;ity of an unblemi&s;hed integrity of conduct, they might be remov|able on an addre&s;s to the Executive, from both branches of the legi&s;lature. To pre|vent the effect of envy, of intrigues, and the popular frenzy of the moment, it &s;hould be made a matter of deliberation. Let it be nece&s;&s;ary, that two thirds, at lea&s;t, of each branch concur in the addre&s;s. The&s;e pro|vi&s;ions, I apprehend, will hold the Judges &s;ufficiently accountable. As was hinted above, their &s;ituation, different from that of other rulers, does not require, or even admit, of the &s;ame kind of accountability. Their unju&s;t deci&s;ions may render them odious, may &s;ubject them to trial, puni&s;h|ment, and removal; but can add very lit|tle to their own emolument or power.</P>

They &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted in one form or another, among all the northern nations of Europe, and were by them introduced into all the gov|ernments of their conque&s;ts. They have, however, been pre&s;erved in very few. They are a powerful &s;upport of civil lib|erty, and cannot long exi&s;t in a govern|ment wholly arbitrary.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="025297_0163_0FCCF4A68FA6A720">Among the Engli&s;h, their hi&s;tory does not reach the antiquity of the in&s;titution.

<P>In mixed governments, like that of Great Britain, the intervention of juries, both in the pro&s;ecution of crimes, and in deci&s;ion of private rights, is a principal &s;ecurity to the &s;ubject, again&s;t the danger|ous power and influence of the monarchi|cal and ari&s;tocratic branches.

The mind is reconciled to it, and acquie&s;ces in it, from a view of the con&s;equences merely, unle&s;s, when the pa&s;|&s;ion of revenge excites a de&s;ire of retaliation.</NOTE> As more men are capable of feeling, than rea&s;oning, and all feel before they rea&s;on, the fir&s;t view is rather unamitable. The Mini&s;ters of ju&s;tice are the objects of the&s;e feelings.

It is true, al&s;o, that in a complicated &s;tate of &s;ociety, the law may become intricate, and its application not a little difficult. This, however, can happen, in que&s;tions only of a civil nature. No crimes are to be made out by a con&s;truction of dubious facts, or a doubtful application of law. It is the province of the Judges to explain and apply the law, when it is &s;ubmitted to them, by the Jury, on a &s;tatement of facts. To &s;uch &s;tatement the Jury are fully competent.</P>
<P>Will it be thought &s;trange to a&s;&s;ert, that profe&s;&s;ional and &s;y&s;tematic knowlege is le&s;s competent to judge of proofs of fact, than plain &s;en&s;e, conver&s;ant only in the common bu&s;ine&s;s of life, and the common characters of men? And yet, to the mortification of the great and the learned, experience has e&s;tabli&s;hed this to be generally true. It is not without rea&s;on, that men acquie&s;ce more readily in the verdict of a Jury, than in the opinion of the Judges, in matters of fact. At the &s;ame time, there is another con&s;ideration of nearly equal weight. The Judges are viewed as a di&s;tinct cla&s;s, placed above the common intere&s;t and common feelings of the citizens. Hence ari&s;es an idea, though often ill founded, of a di&s;tinct
<PB N="171" REF="025297_0170_0FCCF4B274A53410">
intere&s;t, and a general bias upon certain que&s;tions. Juries are, or ought to be, tak|en from the &s;ub&s;tantial cla&s;s of citizens. Effectual provi&s;ion &s;hould be made to guard again&s;t every inlet to the corruption of Juries, and again&s;t the admi&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e on trial, who may be &s;ubject to prejudice, or inte|re&s;ted views in their deci&s;ions. With the&s;e precautions, the ju&s;tice of their deci&s;ions will be attributed to the excellence of the admini&s;tration. If, at any time, they &s;houd prove unju&s;t, it will be attributed to the imperfections of humanity. It will be viewed as a temporary inconvenience, for which the laws are not an&s;werable; while unju&s;t deci&s;ions made by the Judges, are con&s;idered as dictated by &s;tanding, official prejudices, by intere&s;t, or &s;ecret corruption, which, however dangerous, are not ea&s;ily removed.</P>
<P>From this brief view, it appears, that the in&s;titution, in which I comprehend both Grand and Petit Juries, is intimately con|nected with the principles of a free govern|ment. It &s;ufficiently obviates any danger, which might be &s;uppo&s;ed to ari&s;e from the independence of the Judges, and &s;ecures the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, in the &s;pirit of impartiality and moderation, the true &s;pirit of a free government.</P>

<P>It is propo&s;ed, in this Sketch, to enquire, In what &s;en&s;e men are born equal?&mdash;In what &s;en&s;e they are &s;aid to have equal rights?&mdash;Of the nature of equality in Re|publics&mdash;And of the right and equality of de&s;cents.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION I.</HI> In what &s;en&s;e Men are born equal&mdash;And in what &s;en&s;e they are &s;aid to have equal Rights.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been &s;aid, and ju&s;tly, that there are natural inequalities among men. Some are &s;tronger, others are weaker. They dif|fer no le&s;s in their mental powers. The&s;e differences frequently depend on the &s;truc|ture and organization of the body, and ari&s;e from cau&s;es, which began their ope|ration antecedent to the birth. They are, &s;ometimes, derived through a long line of ance&s;tors. Men therefore, are not born equal. There are, likewi&s;e, adventitious inequalities. The &s;ame object, whether
<PB N="173" REF="025297_0172_0FCCF4B64DEF8910">
phy&s;ical or moral, cannot be exhibited to every one, at all times, in the &s;ame point of view. The minds of all are not alike &s;u&s;ceptible of impre&s;&s;ions from the &s;ame object.</P>
<P>Nature has opened a great variety of pur&s;uits, which are lawful, and which are, more, or le&s;s, nece&s;&s;ary to men. Different men are nece&s;&s;itated to different pur&s;uits. No one man is equal to the ta&s;k of all, nor do his occa&s;ions require it. The conveni|ence of all, mutual intere&s;t, and mutual accommodation, dictate to each, a certain degree of limitation in his pur&s;uits. Dif|ferent pur&s;uits require different degrees of exerci&s;e, which produce different degrees of bodily &s;trength. The different objects, exhibited in the variety of pur&s;uits, produce different degrees of knowlege. The&s;e cau&s;es, &s;ometimes, correct, but more fre|quently, increa&s;e the original inequalities, both of body and mind.</P>
<P>When therefore, it is &s;aid, that men are born equal, it cannot be under&s;tood, that they are born with equal powers and facul|ties, or an equal facility of improvement; or that the laws of their nature admit, in practice, of equal acqui&s;itions. Can it mean any thing more than, that all men are born equally free, and have an equal right to follow the laws of their nature, compre|hending

all its relations? So far men are equal in rights. Power and right are not convertible terms. Rights are the re&s;ult of certain relations. They do not, for their exi&s;tence, e&s;&s;entially, or principally depend on power. Power is nece&s;&s;ary to the pre|&s;ent exerci&s;e only, to the full enjoyment. They are &s;anctioned by the laws of our nature, and are as immutable as the laws them&s;elves. A man may, by force, be deprived of the pre&s;ent exerci&s;e and enjoy|ment of his rights; but he is not, therefore, deprived of the rights them&s;elves. Are the laws of nature, are civil laws de&s;troyed, becau&s;e they are violated? Certainly they are not.</P>
<P>Rights may be divided into general, or primary, and particular, or &s;econdary rights. General rights are, fir&s;t, tho&s;e which are purely the rghts of the mind, or intellectu|al rights.

Under the la&s;t head, comes the general right of making acqui&s;itions. The exerci&s;e of this right, therefore, is &s;ub|ject to particular modifications. Particular rights are found in certain relations to &s;omething external. They are the title, which a man derives from the exerci&s;e of his powers and faculties, in any ju&s;t and lawful mode of appropriation, to the ex|clu&s;ive enjoyment of tho&s;e things, which he has brought within his general right of acqui&s;ition. The general right of acqui&s;i|tion, is the foundation of particular rights. The latter are derived from the for|mer. They do not &s;tand in oppo&s;ition, but in perfect harmony. Without the particular right, by which men are &s;ecured in the enjoyment of thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;everal acqui&s;i|tions, a general right to acquire would be of no avail. The general rights, however a part of them, to render them univer&s;ally reciprocal in &s;ociety, may be &s;ubjected to certain modifications, can never ju&s;tly be abridged, or &s;uffer any dim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nution, either directly or by con&s;equence.

<PB N="176" REF="025297_0175_0FCCF4BACD4FF968">
are liable to various alterations and modifications. The man may cea&s;e, and with him all his rights. The &s;ubject may cea&s;e. The right to the &s;ubject may be forfeited by the laws of &s;ociety. It may be transferred, enlarged, or dimini&s;hed.</P>
<P>Of property it is univer&s;ally true, that he, who has the full right of enjoyment, has likewi&s;e the right of di&s;po&s;al. The right of di&s;po&s;al is co-exten&s;ive with the right of acqui&s;ition. Although one may have a pre&s;ent, exclu&s;ive right of property in a certain &s;ubject, it is neverthele&s;s open to another's right of acqui&s;ition, by mutual compromi&s;e. In this con&s;i&s;ts the harmony and reciprocity of the general right of ac|qui&s;ition with the general rights of proper|ty. Different powers may give, greater or le&s;s extent to particular rights, or to the &s;ubject of tho&s;e rights. The greater the powers and faculties of an individual, the more things he may bring within his par|ticular rights. The re&s;ult of all this is, that general rights alone are permanent, are equally and fully attendant upon every individual. So far all are equal in rights. Particular rights are, for the mutual ac|commodation, and happine&s;s of men, &s;ub|jected to their occa&s;ions and nece&s;&s;ities. Indeed, were not this the ca&s;e, the &s;en&s;e of property mu&s;t be fallacious; arts mu&s;t

<HEAD><HI>SECTION II.</HI> Of the Nature of Equality in Republics.</HEAD>
<P>SOME of the mo&s;t eminent writers on government, have &s;uppo&s;ed an equality of property, as well as of rights to be nece&s;&s;a|ry in a republic. They have, therefore, pre&s;cribed limits to individual acqui&s;ition. The Rea&s;on given is, that riches give power to tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s them, and that tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s power, will always abu&s;e it to the oppre&s;&s;ion of others. If this be a good rea&s;on for limiting the acqui&s;ition of riches, there is equal rea&s;on for limiting the improvement of bodily &s;trength and men|tal abilities. Such a &s;tep would be an a|bridgement of the primary rights of man, and counteract almo&s;t all the laws of his nature. It would, perhaps, could it be re|duced to practice, place the whole human race in a &s;tate of fearle&s;s quietude; but it would be a &s;tate of ta&s;tele&s;s enjoyment, of &s;tupid inactivity, not to be envied by the lowe&s;t tribes of the animal creation.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="025297_0177_0FCCF4BE92A6B438">If &s;uch be the principles of a republican government, it is a government out of na|ture. Tho&s;e have made a wi&s;er choice, who have &s;ubmitted to the le&s;s tyranical principles of ab&s;olute monarchy. The&s;e are not the principles of a republic. They are the principles of anarchy, and of pop|ular tyranny.</P>
<P>We have ju&s;t now enquired into the nature of equality among men, and have &s;een in what it con&s;i&s;ts; a free and equal enjoyment of the primary rights, which are, the intellectual rights, and the right which men have of u&s;ing their powers and faculties, under certain reciprocal modifi|cations, for their own convenience and hap|pine&s;s. The equality nece&s;&s;ary in a repub|lic, requires nothing more, than this equal|ity of primary rights. I &s;hall here in&s;tance in the right of acqui&s;ition only, as being &s;ufficient for my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>To the &s;ecurity of this right, certain re|gulations, as to the modes and conditions of enjoying the &s;econdary rights, or in oth|er words, of holding property, are nece&s;&s;a|ry. Not, indeed, as to the quantity, but the freedom of acqui&s;ition, u&s;e, and di&s;po&s;|al. To give to any individual, or cla&s;s of men, a monopoly, an exclu&s;ive right of ac|qui&s;ition in tho&s;e things, which nature has made the &s;ubjects of property, to perpetu|ate,
<PB N="179" REF="025297_0178_0FCCF4C015D0E660">
and render them unalienable in their hands, is an exclu&s;ion of the rights of oth|ers. It is a violation of the equal rights of man. Of this nature are all exclu&s;ive priv|ileges; all perpetuities of riches and hon|or, and all the pretended rights of primo|geniture. Inequality of property, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of individuals, is not directly, nor by inevitable con&s;equence, &s;ubver|&s;ive of genuine liberty. Tho&s;e laws are, indeed, &s;ubver&s;ive of liberty, which, by e&s;tabli&s;hing perpetuities, deprive the own|er of a right of di&s;po&s;al, and others, &s;o far as they extend, of the right of acqui&s;ition; which annex privileges to property, and by making it a qualification in government, create a powerful ari&s;tocracy.</P>
<P>Riches are the fruit of indu&s;try. Honor the fruit of merit. Both ought, as to their continuance, and the influence which at|tends them, to be le&s;t to the conduct of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. If a man, who, by indu&s;try and economy, has acquired riches, become indolent, or profligate, let him &s;ink into poverty. Let tho&s;e who are &s;till indu&s;tri|ous and economical, &s;ucceed to his enjoy|ments, as to their ju&s;t reward. If a man, who, by noble and virtuous actions, has acquired honor, the e&s;teem of mankind, will behave infamou&s;ly, let him &s;ink into contempt. To exclude the meritorious
<PB N="180" REF="025297_0179_0FCCF4C190D11D60">
from riches and honors, and to perpetuate either to the unde&s;erving, are equally in|jurious to the rights of man in &s;ociety. In both it is to counteract the laws of nature, which have, by the connection of cau&s;e and effect, annexed the proper rewards and puni&s;hments to the actions of men. Wealth, or at lea&s;t, a competency, is the re|ward, provided by the laws of nature, for prudent indu&s;try; want, the puni&s;hment of idlene&s;s and profligacy.</P>
<P>If we make equality of property nece&s;|&s;ary in a &s;ociety, we mu&s;t employ force, a|gain&s;t both the indu&s;trious and the indo|lent. On the one hand, the indu&s;trious mu&s;t be re&s;trained, from every exertion, which may exceed the power, or incli|nation of common capacities; on the oth|er hand, the indolent mu&s;t be forcibly &s;ti|mulated to common exertions. This would be acting the fable of Procru&s;tes who, by &s;tretching, or lopping to his iron bed&s;tead, would reduce every man to his own &s;tand|ard length.</P>
<P>If this method &s;hould be deemed ineli|gible, the only alternative will be, either by open violence, or the &s;ecret fraud of the law, to turn a certain portion of the well-earned acqui&s;itions of the vigilant and in|du&s;trious, to the u&s;e of the indolent and neglectful.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION III.</HI> Of the Right and Equality of De&s;cents.</HEAD>
<P>IN every nation, among whom property, as a provi&s;ion for the future, has become an object of pur&s;uit, except under the mo&s;t arbitrary governments, the right of children to inherit the e&s;tates and intere&s;ts of their parents, has been adopted in their civil in&s;titutions. It has been a que&s;tion, whether this be a dictate of the law of na|ture, or whether it be a regulation of civil policy merely.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e, who maintain, that private pro|perty is a creature of municipal law only, and that its right originates in civil in&s;ti|tutions, do well to &s;uppo&s;e, that every
<PB N="183" REF="025297_0182_0FCCF4CA40886210">
rightful mode of acqui&s;ition and di&s;po&s;al, the transfer of the right, and every mode, by which it can pa&s;s from one to another, originate in the &s;ame in&s;titutions. If, how|ever, the right of property, as, I think, has been, clearly, &s;hewn, be an e&s;tabli&s;hment of natural law; if it re&s;ult from certain relations of nature, and be di&s;covered by an internal &s;en&s;e, an intuitive perception, it will be but a rea&s;onable conclu&s;ion, that the laws of nature, likewi&s;e, reach the ac|qui&s;ition and di&s;po&s;al. Such laws there undoubtedly are; and I am per&s;uaded, it will, on enquiry, be found, that, in the&s;e laws, originates the right of the heirs in the e&s;tate of their ance&s;tors. Civil in&s;titutions have only modified, and confirmed the right. It is not, indeed, an ab&s;olute, but a qualified and &s;ubordinate right, &s;ubjected to the right and occa&s;ions of the ance&s;tor.</P>
<P>The union of parents and children forms a &s;ociety, of all the mo&s;t intimate, and the mo&s;t purely natural. The reciprocal rights and duties, parental and filial, are derived purely from the relations of nature. They are, in their origin, independent of the modifications of art or civil policy. Not only members of the &s;everal families, but others, di&s;tinctly, and forcibly perceive, what I have ventured to call the individu|ality of the&s;e little communities of nature.
<PB N="184" REF="025297_0183_0FCCF4CB52B7C368">
The perception re&s;embles that of the mem|bers united to form the body. All the members of the&s;e little communities are perceptively con&s;cious of the warme&s;t and tendere&s;t intere&s;t, in the good or evil, moral or natural, which befals each other. No man he&s;itates, when he ob&s;erves an in&s;tance of a contrary di&s;po&s;ition, boldly to pronounce it to be unnatural.</P>
<P>When a child is arrived at maturity, and ready, as a new &s;tock, to branch into a new family, it is, from the &s;ub&s;i&s;ting relations, perceived to be the duty of the parent, ac|cording to his ability, and with a due re|gard to the &s;ub&s;i&s;ting or growing relations of the other members of the family, to contribute to the advancement of &s;uch child. Should a parent, in common ca&s;es of this kind, neglect to contribute, every one perceives him to be guilty, tho' not of a civil, yet of a moral crime. He is, at once, believed to be under the pre|vailing influence of avarice, or &s;ome other too &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ion, which has &s;tifled the voice of nature.</P>
<P>The claim of the child, ari&s;es not from any <HI>quid pro quo,</HI> any legal con&s;ideration, advanced on his part, in which the duty, on the part of the parent, originates. Did the duty originate in any &s;uch con&s;idera|tion, the duty and the con&s;ideration would
<PB N="185" REF="025297_0184_0FCCF4CCCBCFE530">
be commen&s;urate. The child, who had contributed lea&s;t to the benefit of his pa|rent, during minority, would have the lea&s;t claim upon the parent for advancement. Where there has been a criminal neglect, or di&s;obedience, on the part of the child, this is truly the ca&s;e. When it has happen|ed through a natural imbecility, the mi&s;|fortune, and not the crime of the child, the obligation of the parent is rather in|hanced, than dimini&s;hed. This is clearly a dictate of nature, and de&s;igned to main|tain a degree of equality among the mem|bers of the &s;ame family, by apportioning the provi&s;ion to the unavoidable exigences of each. The&s;e duties, con&s;i&s;tently with the right of the parent, with his authority, and the harmony of the family union, can be very little, if at all, &s;ubjected to civil rules. They mu&s;t be left to the law of moral obligation.</P>
<P>I think the truth of the&s;e ob&s;ervations cannot be doubted. Hence it clearly fol|lows, that the children, re&s;ulting from the relations of nature, in their connexion, have a lien on the property of the parent; &s;ub|jected neverthele&s;s to the full right of the parent. It as clearly follows that, when the right of the parent cea&s;es, by his death the right of the children takes f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll effect, as &s;urviving members of the connexion.
<PB N="186" REF="025297_0185_0FCCF4CE815CC140">
The law, which confirms it to them, does nothing more, than perform the la&s;t natu|ral duty of the parent.</P>
<P>Where there is no immediate de&s;cend|ants, the &s;ame relations, different only in degree, appear to extend to collaterals. In proportion to the di&s;tance, the relations are le&s;s &s;trongly marked, and the percep|tion of right more faint. It is not ea&s;ily determined, at what preci&s;e point they wholly cea&s;e. It has generally, in the be&s;t ordered &s;tates, been agreed to carry the right, as far, as the relations can be traced. The relations, however remote, clearly carry a right preferable to that of a total &s;tranger.</P>
<P>It may be thought, that if the right of the children, as has been contended, be founded in the laws of nature, tho&s;e laws are immutable, and con&s;equently the right; that it will, therefore, abridge, or wholly &s;uper&s;ede the parent's right of di&s;po&s;al. It is true of the laws of nature, when con&s;i|dered ab&s;tractly, that they are, immutable; but it is not true, in the application. The laws of nature re&s;ult from certain relations. The&s;e relations, remaining under the &s;ame combinations and modifications, the re&s;ult, con&s;equently the law, will be invariably the &s;ame. The relations are &s;ubject to different arrangements. They may be
<PB N="187" REF="025297_0186_0FCCF4D0FA314B08">
enlarged, or dimini&s;hed. They may par|tially or wholly cea&s;e. In all the&s;e ca&s;es, the re&s;ult, and con&s;equently the law, as to its application, will vary, preci&s;ely as the relations them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The parent during his life, has a full right to direct the u&s;e and di&s;po&s;al of his property. That he is under a natural ob|ligation to provide for his hou&s;hold, and to advance his children with his property, as his occa&s;ions admit, and their circum&s;tan|ces require, no more affects the freedom of his right, than any moral obligation affects the freedom of action. On the death of the parent, his right, and the re|lation in which he &s;tood, while living, cea|&s;es. The relation of the children, as far as it re&s;pects the property, of which no di&s;po&s;ition had been made, &s;till remains.

<P>It may likewi&s;e be thought, that if the right of the children be thus e&s;tabli&s;hed, it militates again&s;t the right of the parent to make any te&s;tamentary di&s;po&s;itions of his property. It has been ob&s;erved, in effect, that the right of the children, during the life of the parent, is founded in claims of a moral nature. Of their admi&s;&s;ion and extent, he is, by nature, con&s;tituted the

&s;ole judge. There are other claims upon him and his property, be&s;ides tho&s;e of his children. His property is &s;ubjected, civil|ly, to all claims of right, both of the pub|lic and of individuals, with whom be may be connected. It is &s;ubjected to other claims of a moral nature, of which he is, likewi&s;e, the &s;ole judge. He may think it his duty to give &s;ome of his property for public u&s;e, or for the encouragement of virtue, the reward of humanity, or exem|plary in&s;tances of filial piety. It is &s;ub|ject, during his life, to his occa&s;ions, natu|ral, civil, and moral; and a di&s;po&s;ition, to take effect after his death, is no more in|con&s;i&s;tent with the right of the children, than a transfer while he is living. In &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions, the parent may misjudge; he may have done wrong; but it is, generally, an affair of too much delicacy, to endure the deci&s;ion of the civil law.</P>
<P>After the death of the parent, when his rights are fini&s;hed, and the ju&s;t claims of others an&s;wered, the children have an e|qual claim, and equal right, in the prop|erty of their common ance&s;tor. If nature dictate any preference, it is in favor of the younger, and not of the elder branches.

<HEAD>SKETCH VI. OF THE RIGHTS OF PUNISHMENT AND TAXATION.</HEAD>
<P>THE exerci&s;e of the&s;e rights, by gov|ernment, the right of puni&s;hment, and the right of taxation, are nece&s;&s;ary to its &s;up|port, and even to its very exi&s;tence. The exerci&s;e, however, would &s;eem, on a cur&s;o|ry view, to be an infringement of per&s;onal liberty, and to approach a violation of pri|vate right. Accordingly, it has been held by &s;ome, that they originate in that nece|&s;ity, by which they have &s;uppo&s;ed men to be compelled, on entering into civil &s;ocie|ty, to give up a part of their natural liber|ty. It is propo&s;ed in this Sketch, to con|&s;ider more particularly, the origin, mode of exerci&s;e, and limitation of the&s;e rights.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION I.</HI> Of the Right of Puni&s;hment.</HEAD>
<P>THE right to puni&s;h individuals for crimes again&s;t &s;ociety, is not an arbitrary in&s;titution of civil policy, nor is it origin|ally, and independently inherent, in any particular
<PB N="191" REF="025297_0190_0FCCF4D745942190">
organ of government. It is founded in the moral and &s;ocial nature of man, and is de|rived to government through that chan|nel. We have already &s;een, that man was not formed for individual independence, but for &s;ociety, for civil union in govern|ment. All the liberty of an individual, all his right, which can affect the rights and liberties of others, is placed in an ac|commodation, a mutual compromi&s;e with the rights and liberties of all, and every member of the &s;ociety. To facilitate this accommodation, and to render a compro|mi&s;e of rights practicable, mutual, and &s;afe, is the great object of all civil in&s;titutions and laws.</P>
<P>If man be by nature a &s;ocial being, it is an obvious conclu&s;ion, that it is his duty to forbear to injure the &s;ociety, of which he is a member; and that the violation of this duty is a violation of the laws of his nature. It may here, perhaps, be thought &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that rights and duties are reciprocal; every &s;ociety mu&s;t have a right corre&s;pond|ing with the duty of the individual; if the individual violate his duty to the &s;ociety, the &s;ociety have clearly a right to take &s;a|tisfaction. But, as this &s;ubject is of great importance in national juri&s;prudence, I &s;hall be more particular in the inve&s;tigation, by attempting to anali&s;e the right, and trace it to its &s;ource in the nature of man.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="025297_0191_0FCCF4D817410C78">Deity, in the con&s;titution of nature, has not done every thing for man. He has e&s;tabli&s;hed certain relations, from which re&s;ult the laws, which ought to govern, both moral and &s;ocial actions. He has given man powers and faculties, for di&s;co|vering the&s;e relations, and the laws, which re&s;ult from them. The mode of giving the&s;e laws their full effect, is left to his &s;agacity, to the exerci&s;e of his rea&s;oning powers. This is not all. To enable him more &s;teadily to pur&s;ue them, and to give them a greater effect, he is furni&s;hed with a &s;en&s;e of right and wrong, and a &s;en&s;e of merit and demerit, attending the ob&s;erv|ance or non-ob&s;ervance; the moral &s;en&s;e, and the &s;en&s;e of accountability. The&s;e &s;en&s;es, when rightly informed, extend their authority to every moral, every &s;ocial, and every civil action. Hence, on the perpe|tration of a crime, ari&s;e in the mind of the perpetrator the feelings of guilt, and a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of a de&s;ert of puni&s;hment. The&s;e &s;entiments are common to men, both in a review of their actions, and in pa&s;&s;ing judgment upon the actions of others. What might at fir&s;t &s;eem to contradict that univer&s;al de&s;ire of happine&s;s, which goes to the nature of every individual, is, that guilt is, &s;ometimes, attended with a &s;trong de&s;ire of puni&s;hment. This is what we,
<PB N="193" REF="025297_0192_0FCCF4D9B2EB2030">
generally, call remor&s;e. If puni&s;hment be inflicted by no other hand, &s;elf puni&s;h|ment is well known to be the gratifica|tion provided by nature, for the violent emotion of remor&s;e. From this view of the &s;ubject, the right of puni&s;hing the guilty, is clearly perceived to be derived from the relations of men in &s;ociety. It was not alone from an extraordinary im|pre&s;&s;ion of the divine anger on the mind of Cain, after the murder of his brother, but from a perception of the&s;e relations, and a right re&s;ulting from them, that he is made to &s;ay, "Who&s;o findeth me &s;hall &s;lay me."</P>
<P>The Marquis Beccaria has founded the right of puni&s;hment, on the &s;ame princi|ples. <Q>Let us (&s;ays he) con&s;ult the human heart; and there we &s;hall find the foun|dation of the &s;overeign's right to puni&s;h; for no advantage in civil policy can be la&s;ting, which is not founded in the inde|lible &s;entiments of the heart of man.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ay on Crimes and Puni&s;hments. Ch. ii.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>In ca&s;es of mere private injury, the right is perceived to belong to the party injured. He has a right to demand reparation for the injury, and a caution again&s;t the like injury in future. The mode of obtaining both is to be regulated by a con&s;ideration of the pre&s;ent nature of &s;ocial rights.
<PB N="194" REF="025297_0193_0FCCF4DB0FA850E8">
Where the right cannot be exerci&s;ed, by the party injured, without danger to the &s;ocial rights of others, the laws of &s;ocial nature dictate a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to an impartial tribunal: a provi&s;ion, which can be made, and enforced, in the union of civil &s;ociety only. When a per&s;on is guilty of a viola|tion of tho&s;e &s;ocial rights, which more im|mediately affect the intere&s;t and happine&s;s of the whole, the right of demanding re|paration and caution is perceived to belong to the community. The perception is fa|cilitated, by means of the &s;ocial &s;en&s;e, mentioned in a former &s;ketch; the &s;en&s;e, by which each member perceives a kind of individuality in the whole, comprehending him&s;elf.</P>
<P>In a &s;tate of any con&s;iderable degree of &s;ocial and civil improvement, men endure with reluctance the exerci&s;e of the right of puni&s;hment, by the party injured. This happens, not becau&s;e men are more unfit, in this &s;tate, for the exerci&s;e; but becau&s;e they have a nicer &s;en&s;e of right and wrong. Their &s;ocial feelings are extended and re|fined. The &s;ecurity and happine&s;s of each individual member, becomes the intere&s;t, as it affects the happine&s;s of the whole. They perceive, not only the inhumanity, to which the practice tends, but the inju&s;tice of which it is, in almo&s;t every in&s;tance,
<PB N="195" REF="025297_0194_0FCCF4DC966C2490">
productive. They perceive, that the pow|er of puni&s;hing can, in almo&s;t no ca&s;e, be exerci&s;ed by the party injured, without a perpetual violation of other's rights, of the obligations of morality, and the danger of a total annihilation of &s;ocial happine&s;s. Hence it becomes, the right, intere&s;t, and duty of every civil community, to puni&s;h by way of caution, all tho&s;e injuries which di&s;turb, or tend to di&s;turb their happine&s;s, or to render it in&s;ecure. And it will ex|tend to whatever the common &s;entiment has connected with the public happine&s;s. It is evident then, that the appropriate right of government, to puni&s;h, by way of caution, the crimes of its members, is not an arbitrary in&s;titution of civil &s;ociety, nor does it originate in nece&s;&s;ity only; but in the &s;entiments of the human heart, the exi&s;ting relations of men in &s;ociety, and has the full &s;anction of the laws of nature.</P>
<P>The organ, by which the right of pun|i&s;hment &s;hall be exerci&s;ed in government, is a con&s;ideration of propriety, &s;afety, and convenience. A flight attention to the &s;ubject, will di&s;cover it to be a branch of the right of legi&s;lation, or in propriety ul|timately connected with the duties of that branch. Without the right of puni&s;h|ment for the violation of a law, the right of legi&s;lation would be perfectly nugatory.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="025297_0195_0FCCF4DE14C8BD60">There is a threefold divi&s;ion of the right of puni&s;hment, or rather of the exerci&s;e of the right, corre&s;ponding with the general divi&s;ion of the powers of government. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> 1. The decreeing of penalties, which &s;hall be incurred by the breach of any law. This involves a con&s;ideration of the importance of the law, to the intere&s;ts of the &s;tate, and corre&s;ponds with the right of legi&s;la|tion. To that branch therefore, it will, with propriety, be intru&s;ted. 2. The ap|plication of the law to particular ca&s;es, for the purpo&s;e of determining whether it has been violated, and who has incurred the penalty. This is clearly, the proper bu&s;ine&s;s of the judiciary. 3. The execu|tion of the &s;entence upon the criminal, which falls to the province of the execu|tive.</P>
<P>The right of puni&s;hing is, in practice, frequently limited, only by the will of the legi&s;lature, and the deci&s;ions of the judicia|ry; but the laws of nature have not left it arbitrary. They have a&s;&s;igned certain limits, beyond which the right cea&s;es, and the exerci&s;e of the power becomes a crime again&s;t &s;ociety. The&s;e limits are not, in every &s;en&s;e, permanent and invariable. It is univer&s;ally true, that it is limited by the end of preventing crimes, and &s;ecuring obedience to the laws. It is al&s;o true, that
<PB N="197" REF="025297_0196_0FCCF4DFA1040E90">
the penalties, which, in one &s;tate of &s;ocie|ty and manners, are adequate to that end, may, in a different &s;tate, be wholly inad|equate.</P>
<P>Not only the &s;tate of manners, but the principles of the government affect the &s;e|verity of puni&s;hments. Where the &s;upport of the reigning powers, without any regard to the good of the people, is the &s;ole end of every mea&s;ure of &s;tate, fear, which is in|culcated by the &s;everity of puni&s;hments, is the only principle of obedience. Such governments admit of limits, neither to crimes, nor to the &s;everity of puni&s;hments. No actions are con&s;idered to be criminal, becau&s;e they are injurious to the people, or even again&s;t the laws of nature; but becau&s;e they are conceived to be danger|ous to the reigning power, and a contempt of its authority. In proportion as govern|ments have a&s;cended to natural principles, and made the happine&s;s of the people the end of their in&s;titutions, crimes and puni&s;h|ments have admitted of more definite lim|its. It has been perceived and acknow|leged, that, in a civil view, tho&s;e actions only are criminal, which are injurious to the community, or to individuals, who&s;e rights and happine&s;s the community is bound to protect, and &s;ecure; that the prevention of crimes is the &s;ole end of

puni&s;hments; and that all beyond this is the &s;pirit of revenge, or of wanton cruelty.</P>
<P>It is worthy of remark, that in the pro|gre&s;s of &s;ociety, no &s;cience has received &s;o little improvement as that of criminal juri&s;|prudence. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The world is more indebted to the Marquis Beccaria, for his little treati&s;e on Crimes and Pun|i&s;hments, than to all other writers on the &s;ubject.</NOTE> It is true, that many circum|&s;tances of outrageous violence, with which capital and other puni&s;hments were inflict|ed, have, in &s;ome nations, been aboli&s;hed; but it may, with equal truth, be ob&s;erved, that among tho&s;e nations, who boa&s;t the highe&s;t refinement, the greate&s;t degree of improvement in their civil policy, the number of capital puni&s;hments, has been increa&s;ed out of all proportion to the re|form in point of cruelty.

<P>Several cau&s;es have concurred to prevent any con&s;iderable improvement in the crim|inal code. Men appear, often, to have entertained an idea of ju&s;tice, as of a phy|&s;ical

Beyond the&s;e it has no relation, nor even mental exi&s;tence. This notion has done infinite mi&s;chief in the world. It has repre&s;ented ju&s;tice, as really offended, in proportion to the crime committed, and inexorably demanding &s;atisfaction by a certain, determinate puni&s;hment to be in|flicted on the offender; like the malevo|lent deities of &s;ome nations, who are to be conciliated with human &s;acrifices only.

<P>A puni&s;hment annexed to a crime is, by the force of habitual a&s;&s;ociation, viewed in connexion with the crime, and often &s;erves as a mea&s;ure for the degree of its guilt, which ari&s;es only from its relation to &s;oci|ety. When, from any cau&s;e, the perpe|tration of a particular &s;pecies of crimes

Humanity, who&s;e dictates are more readily obeyed, than the requi&s;itions of law, is intere&s;ted in the e&s;cape, or acquital of the criminal. When the &s;everity of the puni&s;hment ex|cites the pity of the people, the effect of puni&s;hment is more than lo&s;t.

The puni&s;hment ought never to exceed, but rather to fall &s;hort of the demerit of the crime in the &s;entiments of the people. Where this is the ca&s;e, humanity is engag|ed on the &s;ide of the laws, and puni&s;hment is rendered as certain, as the perpetration of the crime. This adds a mild, but effec|tual and irre&s;i&s;table energy to the execu|tion of the laws. It is univer&s;ally true, that certainty of puni&s;hment has a much more powerful effect, than &s;everity, in the prevention of crimes. Indeed, the re&s;ent|ment and contempt of mankind, which always pur&s;ue the perpetrators of a crime, if not converted into compa&s;&s;ion, by the &s;everity of the law, con&s;titute a puni&s;hment of no incon&s;iderable efficacy.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION II.</HI> Of the Right of Taxation.</HEAD>
<P>THE Right of Taxation is, no more than the right of puni&s;hment, an arbitrary in&s;titution of civil policy, or originally and independently inherent in any particular organ of the government. Wherever it is placed, it is a betru&s;ted right. The right it&s;elf, like all legitimate, &s;ocial, and civil rights, is derived from the relations of men in &s;ociety.</P>
<P>It is perceived, even by the mo&s;t &s;imple, that from the relations of men in civil &s;ocie|ty, there re&s;ults a duty upon them, not on|ly to forbear to injure the &s;ociety, but al&s;o to contribute to its &s;upport, and pro&s;perity. The &s;ocial &s;en&s;e, which has &s;everal times been mentioned, has no incon&s;iderable ef|fect
<PB N="203" REF="025297_0202_0FCCDA42849AAE30">
in rendering the perception di&s;tinct, and in collecting and fixing the object of this duty. The duty may be called, the duty of contribution on the one hand, from which, on the other, re&s;ults to the &s;ociety the right of taxation. The right of taxation is nothing more than a right to enforce the duty of contribution, to which every member of the community is originally bound. The duty and the right, wherever it re&s;ides, are reciprocal. The duty is the &s;ame upon every individ|ual member, as to the reality, not as to the quantity of the contribution.</P>
<P>No civil duty, perhaps, can le&s;s be tru&s;t|ed to the voluntary conduct of individuals. None more needs a provi&s;ion of general rules, to &s;ecure equal ju&s;tice, both to indi|viduals and to the community. The utility of the community cannot be oppo&s;ed to the utility of the individual members in gen|eral. Neverthele&s;s the latter, from its be|ing more immediate, &s;o far outweighs the former, that they are often viewed in op|po&s;ition. The duty, therefore, would ne|ver be performed, unle&s;s there exi&s;ted, &s;omewhere, a right, with authority to en|force it, as well as to apportion the quan|tity. The end of this duty is the utility of the community; not indeed, in an ab|&s;olute &s;en&s;e; but in a certain relation, pro|portion
<PB N="204" REF="025297_0203_0FCCF4E6544FA560">
and agreement with the utility of individuals.</P>
<P>The right of apportioning and enforcing this duty, which is the right of taxation, is originally, in the community, con&s;idered as an aggregate body. The organ, by which it &s;hall be exerci&s;ed, is, as in the ca&s;e of puni&s;hment, a con&s;ideration of pro|priety, convenience, and &s;afety. The ap|portionment mu&s;t be made by general and equal rules, and the demand enforced by the &s;anctions of law. It is, therefore, with propriety and convenience entru&s;ted to the legi&s;lative body. If &s;uch body be compo|&s;ed of a full and equal repre&s;entation of the &s;everal national, as well as particular intere&s;ts, the betru&s;tment is &s;afe. The power and right of taxation can be entru&s;|ted to no man, or body of men, who are not amenable to the people for the exer|ci&s;e, and who do not equally &s;hare the burdens, which they impo&s;e, without a mo|ral certainty, of oppre&s;&s;ion, the total &s;ub|ver&s;ion of liberty, and all &s;ecurity of pri|vate property. Thus it comes out, that the great que&s;tion about taxation and rep|re&s;entation, is a que&s;tion about modes, ra|ther than rights; a mere con&s;ideration of &s;afety to the rights of the people. It is indeed, a mo&s;t important con&s;ideration; but it does not reach the original right,
<PB N="205" REF="025297_0204_0FCCF4E825AA6CF0">
founded in the duty of contribution. The repre&s;entation of any part in the national legi&s;lature, is a proof of an intimate civil connexion, which undoubtedly &s;ubjects them to the duty of contribution; but if the people chu&s;e to entru&s;t the right of taxation, in any other mode, or to any other body, the exerci&s;e may be equally legitimate.</P>
<P>It is not ea&s;y, perhaps, to a&s;certain with preci&s;ion, what degree of &s;ocial union, among individuals, will incur the duty of contribution. It is, however, clear, that one community can have no right to tax, per&s;onally, the members of another com|munity, where the citizens of both are not united ultimately, by an internal, recipro|cal, civil connexion. States in league may, as far as the league extends, incur, one to the other, the duty of contribution; but the duty is demandable again&s;t the States collectively, not again&s;t particular members Each &s;tate has a demand again&s;t the other, and the &s;everal &s;tates have a demand again&s;t their citizens individually, to enable them to fulfil their engagements. Between the &s;everal &s;tates, the right to enforce the duty re&s;ides equally in every part, till, by mutual agreement, a body is formed for its exerci&s;e. Till this has taken place, it remains, like that of independent
<PB N="206" REF="025297_0205_0FCCF4E95463D940">
individuals, a voluntary duty; or to be enforced only by an appeal to the law of nations&mdash;the right of the &s;word.</P>
<P>So different are the intere&s;ts, both gen|eral and particular, in different &s;tates, that no univer&s;al rules can be pre&s;cribed, as to the particular mode of taxation, which &s;hall be equally applicable to all. It will ever be a con&s;ideration of public convenience and private equity. The lawful intere&s;t of no citizen, or cla&s;s of citizens, can, without inju&s;tice, and a violation of equal rights, be &s;acrificed to that of another, or even to that of the whole. That mode ought to be adopted, which, as far as general rules can extend, will operate agreeably to the principles of mutual com|promi&s;e. A rule, very general, indeed, which has been applied in ethics, may, with great propriety, be applied in this ca&s;e. Requi&s;ition &s;hall be made of a man, ac|cording to that, which he hath, and not according to that, which he hath not. Taxes, therefore ought not to be appor|tioned upon per&s;ons, but upon things; upon property po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed or u&s;ed by indivi|duals. Its valuation, however, ought not to be according to the e&s;timated value in market, but according to the ordinary re|venue, which it may afford.</P>
<P>It has been u&s;ual to apportion taxes upon
<PB N="207" REF="025297_0206_0FCCF4EB479E9F60">
a valuation of the property or thing taxed. This will be ju&s;t and equal, provided the valuation be made, not according to the market rates, but according to the income, which it may produce, with ordinary man|agement. There are yet &s;ome exceptions, which will occur in their place.</P>
<P>Protection has, by many, been held, to be the con&s;ideration, on the one &s;ide, in which is founded the right of taxation, on the other. If it were &s;o, protection &s;hould &s;erve as a mea&s;ure for the apportionment of taxes to individuals. But this is not the ca&s;e. The duty of contribution, and con&s;equently the right of taxation, ari&s;es from the whole relations, in which men &s;tand in &s;ociety. The &s;ame thing is true of every civil right and duty. The gene|ral relations are connected, and form a certain internal relation among them&s;elves. If we take away one relation, it deranges the connection, varies the mutual relations, and, of cour&s;e, the re&s;ult. In tho&s;e gov|ernments, in which the rights of the &s;ove|reign are &s;uppo&s;ed to be original, and inde|pendent of the rights of the people, it is in perfect con&s;i&s;tency with the principles of the government, to derive the &s;overeign's right of taxation from the protection af|forded to the &s;ubject, as a con&s;ideration. Where, as in democratic republics, tho&s;e
<PB N="208" REF="025297_0207_0FCCF4ECA81D0EE8">
who exerci&s;e the &s;overeign power, are only con&s;tituted organs, and exerci&s;e only the power of the people a&s;&s;ociated in civil gov|ernment, the con&s;ideration between the &s;overeign and the people does not exi&s;t. The &s;overeign power, the whole right, is the power and the right of the people, thus a&s;&s;ociated, not individually, but col|lectively.</P>
<P>It is very true, that the laws of nature, from which re&s;ult all legitimate civil rights and duties, are always calculated to attain &s;ome u&s;eful end; but the u&s;eful end to be attained, is the criterion, by which to judge of their authenticity, rather, than the con|&s;ideration, or foundation of the duty im|po&s;ed; the final, not the efficient cau&s;e. The right of the citizen to civil protection, is independent of any &s;uch con&s;ideration; and any apportionment of taxes, upon that principle, would be gro&s;ly unequal, and oppre&s;&s;ive. It would make the poor and the weak the greate&s;t debtors to the &s;tate, for contributors they could not be. It would, at once, be de&s;tructive of it&s;elf, by turning protection into oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The con&s;ideration of ab&s;tract relations, and ab&s;tract rights, fabrications of the mind only, which may, or may not, ju&s;tly comprehend the relations and rights of na|ture, and are, perhaps, never preci&s;ely the

&s;ame, in the conception of any two indi|viduals, cannot furni&s;h &s;ufficient data for the apportionment of takes. It is nece&s;&s;ary to find &s;omething more fixed and certain, and to take real quantities, as well in the data as in the product.</P>
<P>The only plau&s;ible theory, and which is capable of being reduced to practice, by the application of real quantities, is, that every individual in any community &s;hall contribute to its &s;upport, in proportion to his enjoyments, as a member of that com|munity. In this, however, no regard is to be had to mental, but to apparent and &s;en&s;ible enjoyments. Upon this principle the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and the u&s;e of property be|come the data for apportioning taxes to in|dividuals. I have added the u&s;e, which will comprehend the con&s;umption, at lea&s;t beyond what is common and nece&s;&s;ary to every cla&s;s; becau&s;e &s;ome will place the enjoyment in the u&s;e of con&s;umption, ra|ther than of profit in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. They may chu&s;e, while others hoard or u&s;e for profit, to &s;pend their acqui&s;itions in the gratification of their pa&s;&s;ions and appetites.</P>
<P>Taxes ought to be a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed according to a general valuation. This mode will be &s;ubject <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o &s;ome inequalities; but the ine|qualities will not be greater, than what will always, happen in particular a&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ments.
<PB N="210" REF="025297_0209_0FCCF4F0593F5160">
If taxes &s;hould happen to fall more equally in the latter mode, yet they have, in the former, great advantages, from be|ing known and certain; a very important con&s;ideration in the levying of taxes. It is, perhaps, a con&s;ideration of equal weight, that men are, generally, le&s;s di&s;&s;atisfied with the inequalities of fortune, than tho&s;e, which are impo&s;ed upon them by the ig|norance, prejudice, or caprice of their fellow citizens. If, from the nature and &s;ituation of any &s;pecies of property, which is a &s;ubject of taxation, great inequalities will unavoidably intervene, &s;uch property &s;hould be taxed with a degree of modera|tion proportioned to the inequality. It is a great alleviation, in &s;uch ca&s;es, that none are oppre&s;&s;ively overburthened, though &s;ome may pay le&s;s than their ju&s;t propor|tion.</P>
<P>Taxes ought not only to be equal, but, as far as the rea&s;onable exigencies of the &s;tate require, and general rules can extend, to be apportioned to the vi&s;ible means of the citizens, both collectively and indivi|dually. This, however, mu&s;t be under|&s;tood with &s;ome limitation. They ought not to be apportioned upon the means of living, but upon the means of payment, or what, on an ordinary calculation, ought to be the means of payment. This object

can be attained only by an exten&s;ive know|lege of the different intere&s;ts, employments, modes, and nece&s;&s;ary expence of living, with the different cla&s;&s;es of citizens. With &s;uch knowlege the legi&s;lators may, in the general mode of valuation, and with a par|ticular attention to the &s;ubjects of taxation, in a great mea&s;ure, if not altogether, ex|empt from the burden of taxes, the ne|ce&s;&s;ary means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">orer cla&s;s of citizens, who, though they may contribute nothing, directly, to the &s;upport of government, are far from being the lea&s;t u&s;eful cla&s;s in the &s;tate.</P>
<P>The exigences of the &s;tate mu&s;t limit the aggregate &s;um to be demanded in taxes. But the demand ought never, for any continuance, to equal the &s;um of pri|vate revenues; much le&s;s ought it to be &s;uffered to dimini&s;h the capital &s;tock. Were government, by thus anticipating the revenue of its citizens, to deprive them of every comfortable pro&s;pect in a provi|&s;ion for the future, it would take away all incitement to enterprize, and even the &s;pirit of private indu&s;try and economy. If in addition to this, the enormity of the de|mand, &s;hould con&s;tantly dimini&s;h the cap|ital &s;tock, nothing would be pre&s;ented to view, but the gloomy pro&s;pect of inevita|ble poverty and di&s;tre&s;s; a &s;ituation in

<P>The mode of apportionment, ought not to be directed by any &s;ingle cla&s;s of citi|zens, but by the intere&s;t of the whole, which con&s;i&s;ts in a certain ratio of the par|ticular intere&s;ts. If in the political con&s;i|deration of taxes, the intere&s;t of the &s;tate, by which is generally meant, nothing more, than the intere&s;t of the majority, comes in competition with the intere&s;t of any cla&s;s of the citizens, in their lawful pur&s;uits, their intere&s;t ought not to be wholly &s;ac|rifi&s;ed to that of the &s;tate, much le&s;s to that of another cla&s;s. Every affair of this nature &s;hould be conducted upon the prin|ciples of a compromi&s;e of intere&s;ts. In adju&s;ting the compromi&s;e, however, the magnitude of the intere&s;ts in competition is not to be adopted as the only rule of preference: Such rule would frequently prove a total &s;acrifice of the minor intere&s;t. Where it is demanded of particular per|&s;ons or cla&s;&s;es that they give up their in|tere&s;t for public &s;ervice, they are as fully, as in cau&s;es which ari&s;e in ca&s;es between individuals only, entitled to a compen&s;a|tion

for all that, which exceeds their par|ticular proportion. Such interferences will, however, rarely happen, unle&s;s taxa|tion is applied to other purpo&s;es, than tho&s;e merely of rai&s;ing a public revenue.</P>
<P>In modern times taxes, be&s;ides their fi|nancical purpo&s;es, have been employed as a principal engine of &s;tate, for directing the indu&s;try of the citizens into tho&s;e par|ticular channels of arts, manufactures, or commerce, which are deemed to be mo&s;t for the pre&s;ent intere&s;t of the community. A Briti&s;h writer ob&s;erves, that <Q>taxes may be &s;o contrived, as to rival bounties, in promoting indu&s;try, manufactures, and commerce.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Kaims's Sketches, B. II. Sk. viii. Sec. 1.</NOTE></Q> That they can have the effect to promote indu&s;try in general, is not very obvious. They may certainly be &s;o contrived, as to promote it in particular channels; but perhaps, this is generally, if not always, done, by diverting it from others.</P>
<P>The application of taxes, to the&s;e pur|po&s;es may, within certain limits, be high|ly beneficial to a community. Nations do not always make equal progre&s;s in tho&s;e arts, which furni&s;h the nece&s;&s;aries, con|veniencies, and elegancies of life.

Where this is the ca&s;e, it may be a happy contrivance to exempt the home productions of a manufacture from taxes, and to impo&s;e a duty upon foreign productions of the &s;ame kind. It may enable the home manufacturer, by the ad|vanced price of his goods, to indemnify him&s;elf, in a good mea&s;ure, for the ri&s;k and expence of a new undertaking. But it is ea&s;ily perceived, that in a regulation of this kind, whatever the manufacturer gains by the advanced price of his goods, is real|ly a tax upon the con&s;umer; and as it has a tendency to exclude competitors, it is nece&s;&s;ary to proceed with caution, le&s;t it degenerate into a &s;y&s;tem of monopoly, one of the greate&s;t evils in civil policy. there is, likewi&s;e, danger le&s;t tho&s;e, who are already engaged in lawful pur&s;uits, and entitled to equal right, though, perhaps, not to equal favor, &s;hould, by an over burden, be too much deprived of their rea|&s;onable gains, and, perhaps, be too ha&s;tily forced into different pur&s;uits, without the &s;ame pro&s;pect of an indemnification for their ri&s;k and experience.

<P>THE learned Judge <HI>Black&s;tone,</HI> in his Commentaries &s;ays, <Q>It hath been holden, and very ju&s;tly, by the principal of our ethical writers, that human laws are bind|ing on men's con&s;ciences.</Q> But after|wards he &s;ays, <Q>True as this principle is, it mu&s;t be under&s;tood with &s;ome re&s;trictions.

For otherwi&s;e the multitude of penal laws in a &s;tate, would not only be looked upon as impolitic, but would al&s;o be a very wicked thing, if every breach of &s;uch laws were made a &s;nare for men's con&s;ciences. But in the&s;e ca&s;es, the alternative is offered to every man, either to do this, or &s;ubmit to the penalty, and his con&s;cience is &s;afe, which ever &s;ide of the alternative he &s;ees fit to take.</Q></P>
<P>Judge Black&s;tone &s;eems to have been drawn into this conclu&s;ion from the &s;tate of criminal law in Great-Britain. It was not his de&s;ign to improve the laws of Eng|land; but to facilitate the &s;tudy; not to write a critici&s;m, or examine their merits, but to give the elements of a &s;y&s;tem, which was already formed. Had his &s;ubject led him to a clo&s;e attention to the nature of
<PB N="218" REF="025297_0217_0FCCF4FE025C4368">
laws, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ounded in the principles of &s;ociety, in a free government, &amp; the only end, which can be admitted in penal laws, he would probably have found rea&s;on for a different opinion; e&s;pecially, as far as re&s;pects the performance of tho&s;e po&s;itive duties, which the general good of a well con&s;tituted &s;o|ciety, in civil government, requires.</P>
<P>We have before &s;een, that man was formed for a &s;tate of civil government, and furni&s;hed with a di&s;po&s;ition and principles which both allure and impel him to that &s;tate. Government may be originally form|ed upon different models; and each, in a cour&s;e of improvement, may receive many and great alterations. There are, however, principles common to all, ari&s;ing from their general nature. From a variety of circum&s;tances, &s;ituation of country, and different degrees of improvement, in arts, &s;ciences, and manners, they may have particular principles ari&s;ing from the par|ticular nature of each.</P>
<P>When any individual acts in conformity to the laws of his nature, as con&s;tituted by the author of his being, taking in all con|nexions and dependencies, for every thing is relative, nothing &s;tands alone, the actions of that individual are right and fit; &s;o far as he deviates from tho&s;e laws, they are wrong, or vicious. From the nature of man, it is impo&s;&s;ible, that a &s;ociety &s;hould,
<PB N="219" REF="025297_0218_0FCCF500187E91A0">
like an individual direct its actions by any common united volition. It mu&s;t be done by rules or laws, by which the actions of every individual, as they concern the &s;o|ciety at large, are to be directed. The &s;ame criterion holds here, as in the ca&s;e of an individual. Tho&s;e actions are right in any &s;ociety, con&s;tituted upon natural principles, which are conformable to the principles and nature of that &s;ociety. The actions of a &s;ociety, which we call civil or political actions, are made up of the actions of indi|vidual members. It therefore clearly fol|lows, that tho&s;e are good laws, which re|quire &s;uch actions of individuals as, taken together in all their connexions, are con|formable to the principles and nature of the &s;ociety; and tho&s;e are bad laws, which deviate from this end. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The foregoing ob&s;ervations may be extended as well to the fundamental laws or laws of the con&s;titution, as to the municipal laws of the &s;tate. Both ought to be equally adapted to the &s;tate of &s;ociety, and of &s;ocial improvements.</NOTE> Let it be ob&s;erv|ed here, that under action I comprehend both performance and forbearance.</P>
<P>Judge Black&s;tone, in another pa&s;&s;age, defines municipal law to be, "a rule of civil conduct, commanding what is right,
<PB N="220" REF="025297_0219_0FCCF50156FA4748">
and prohibiting what is wrong."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Commentaries, vol. i. p. 44. "Municipal law is defined to be a rule of civil conduct, pre&s;cribed by the &s;upreme power in the &s;tate, commanding what is right, and prohibiting what is wrong."</NOTE> If laws command or prohibit that, which is ab&s;o|lutely indifferent to the &s;tate, they deviate from the true &s;pirit and principles of legi&s;|lation in a free government. They are arbitrary. They agree not with the defi|nition, which is a good one, of "com|manding what is right, and prohibiting what is wrong." If they go farther, and command the violation, or forbid the per|formance of any moral duty, they become tyrannically unju&s;t. In the former in&s;tance, in&s;tead of feeling an obligation, we feel our&s;elves in&s;ulted; in the latter we are filled with the utmo&s;t abhorrence of the laws. When laws coincide with the principles above laid down, when they fully agree with the above definition, they are &s;trictly binding on the con&s;ciences of men. They ought not to allow them&s;elves an alterna|tive.</P>
<P>The objection, that in this light the mul|tiplicity of penal laws would become a &s;nare for men's con&s;ciences, does not appear to me to be well founded. It lies with equal weight again&s;t the moral obligation to the greater part of &s;ocial duties. Previ|ous

to a &s;tate of &s;ociety, if man may be &s;uppo&s;ed ever to have exi&s;ted in &s;uch &s;tate, the duties of the &s;olitary individual mu&s;t have been very few and &s;imple. In the fir&s;t &s;tages of &s;ociety, in a &s;imple &s;tate of property, and a &s;tate of manners no le&s;s &s;imple, duties mu&s;t be confined within very narrow limits. Still they would greatly exceed tho&s;e of the &s;olitary individual. In the progre&s;s of &s;ociety, the complex &s;tate of property, great improvements, numer|ous connections, and exten&s;ive intercour&s;e, introduce a great variety of &s;ocial duties. The&s;e are left to be di&s;covered, as the re&s;ult of &s;ituation, circum&s;tances, and relations; nor is the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> di&s;covery and performance thought to be a ta&s;k too difficult. In mat|ters which become the &s;ubject of civil laws, the ca&s;e is ea&s;ier. Many actions are con|&s;idered as evil, only when they are forbid|den. Hence the duty of individuals ari&s;es on the requi&s;ition of the law, and is ex|plained in the law it&s;elf. We are not, however, to &s;uppo&s;e, that civil laws con&s;ti|tute the ultimate fitne&s;s or morality of ac|tions, in a &s;trict &s;en&s;e; but as an individual may allow others to reap advantage from the u&s;e of his property, &s;o government may allow the individual members to do tho&s;e things for their private advantage, which it is fitting &s;hould be the right of the pub|lic.
<PB N="222" REF="025297_0221_0FCCF505263952F8">
In the former ca&s;e, if the individual prohibit to others the farther u&s;e of his property, it is their duty to forbear; to per&s;i&s;t in the u&s;e, will become a private injury. In the latter, if government pro|hibit the doing of tho&s;e things for private advantage, which, though before allowa|ble, by tacit con&s;ent, yet come within the claim and right of the public, the actions, for prohibited become wrong; morally &s;o. It is to be ob&s;erved here, that we are upon general rules or laws, and that the right of government is the right of the whole, not of any particular cla&s;s, as di&s;tinct from the people.</P>
<P>To erect crimes upon actions wholly indifferent to &s;ociety; to gratify the pride and caprice of one cla&s;s of citizens, by al|lowing them what is forbidden to others; to inflict penalties to &s;upport a &s;y&s;tem of monopoly, or for fi&s;cal purpo&s;es rather, then the purpo&s;e of preventing crimes, is to confound every idea of right and wrong in a criminal code. All this is to be found in a great variety of in&s;tances, in the laws of England. We need to in&s;tance only in the fore&s;t laws, the laws for the pre&s;erva|tion of the game, and the penalties for not burying in woolen. In &s;uch ca&s;es, un|able to find any moral re&s;traint, men learn to make a di&s;tinction, between what is
<PB N="223" REF="025297_0222_0FCCF5068BC27B98">
morally, and what is only politically wrong Amid a great variety of laws, &s;ome arbitrary and &s;ome not, their minds are wearied with di&s;criminations.

<P>Few actions, con&s;idered &s;imply, are evil in them&s;elves. They are relatively good or bad. They take their qualities from &s;ituation and circum&s;tances. Reverence to the Supreme Being is, unchangeably, a duty. Such duties, however important, are few in number. Mo&s;t actions of men are of the former kind. Murder for in|&s;tance is one of the mo&s;t heinous crimes in &s;ociety. Yet to kill a man is not always wrong. To kill one, who by violence and wrong attempts my life, is, when the only probable means of &s;aving it, in fact ju&s;tifiable. We conceive an officer to do his duty, when he executes a criminal condemned to death, by the &s;entence of the laws. Should a private per&s;on, with|out authority, kill a criminal, though un|der a legal and ju&s;t &s;entence of death, be would, by common con&s;ent, as well as by

the laws of the land, be deemed guilty of murder. In every country, in the early &s;tages of &s;ociety, when any per&s;on is mur|dered, it is held to be the duty of the next of kin to avenge the blood of the &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in, to put the man-&s;layer to death. This, in the ruder &s;tate of men in &s;ociety, is right. It is, in &s;uch &s;tate, the only known, or prac|ticable made of puni&s;hment, or mean of re&s;traint. In the progre&s;s of &s;ocial im|provement, this mode of puni&s;hment is accompanied with evils, which tend to &s;ap the very foundation of &s;ociety, and di&s;&s;olve every bond of general union. The &s;ole right therefore, of judging and puni&s;hing offenders, for the prevention of crimes, is at length entru&s;ted with government. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> then becomes a crime in the kindred, who had been called the avengers of blood, to attempt &s;uch puni&s;hment, by their own authority. The&s;e are in&s;tances, in which, not only the political, if I may u&s;e the ex|pre&s;&s;ion, but the moral quality of the ac|tion is altered, and even rever&s;ed, by a change of &s;ocial and political circum&s;tan|ces. If tho&s;e only are to be e&s;teemed na|tural duties, which ari&s;e antecedently to &s;ociety, and idependently of any relation to it, and their violation offences <HI>mala in &s;e;</HI> they will be found, not only few in number, but the greater part will be found

to be unnoticed by municipal laws, as be|ing &s;ufficiently guarded by the moral &s;en&s;e and the common principles of humanity. The principal of the&s;e are the duties of re|ligion and &s;elf-pre&s;ervation; and though men are to be protected and &s;ecured in the ob&s;ervance of the&s;e duties, the ob&s;ervance cannot be enforced by human laws.</P>
<P>The laws of nature are not thus limited. When applied to man, the laws of nature are the laws of &s;ocial nature. As, I have before &s;hewn, man is formed for a &s;tate of &s;ociety and civil government. He is fur|ni&s;hed with appetites, pa&s;&s;ions, and facul|ties, which in no other &s;tate have either gratification or u&s;e. In &s;ociety, in civil &s;ociety only, can man act agreeably to the laws of his nature. It is the &s;tate pointed out in his formation; the &s;tate, to which mo&s;t of his pa&s;&s;ions, appetites, faculties, and powers are directed. It is, in truth, his ultimate &s;tate of nature. The more perfect this &s;tate is, the more it harmonizes with the whole &s;tate of man; or rather, the more general operation it gives to the laws of his nature.</P>
<P>If &s;ociety and civil government be founded in natural principles, the laws, which naturally and certainly re&s;ult from &s;uch &s;tate, are laws of nature. There are certain principles, and relations, which are
<PB N="226" REF="025297_0225_0FCCF50C923CCED8">
common to all &s;ocieties, and governments, in the earlie&s;t and rude&s;t &s;tate, and contin|ue unchanged, through every &s;ucce&s;&s;ive degree of improvement. From the&s;e principles and relations re&s;ult laws and duties, which, with one con&s;ent, are deno|mominated, by way of eminence, laws of nature and natural duties. This eminence they have derived from their permanency and univer&s;ality. In the progre&s;s of &s;oci|ety, in the natural cour&s;e of improvement, new and different connexions are formed; new principles and new relations ari&s;e. Hence re&s;ult new laws, and a different cla&s;s of duties. The&s;e laws and the&s;e du|ties will vary, or rather, they will exi&s;t in one &s;ociety, and not in another, according to the various degrees of improvement in each. Still if they re&s;ult from princi|ples, relations, and connexions, which ari&s;e in a natural cour&s;e of improvement, they are, with the former, equally laws of nature, and natural duties. They both, in fact, re&s;ult from a &s;tate of &s;ociety, the natural &s;tate of man. Human laws,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I here comprehend, as well the laws of the con&s;titution, as civil or municipal laws.</NOTE> founded in the&s;e principles, as they ari&s;e in &s;ociety will have the force of moral obligation.

<P>Men would be in a deplorable condition, if the moral &s;en&s;e enforced obedience, alike, to every act of legi&s;lation. The wor&s;t laws, when once enacted, would be receiv|ed with a degree of veneration. The fa|cility of execution would &s;uper&s;ede the nece&s;&s;ity of repeated examination, and fre|quent recurrence to the principles of the government, and the rights, intere&s;t, and &s;entiments of the people, without which the be&s;t intentions of a legi&s;lature, can afford no &s;ecurity again&s;t the danger of tyrannical laws.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION II.</HI> Different Modes, in which Obligation is &s;ometimes di&s;covered&mdash;have concurred to introduce a Di&s;tinction between moral and civil Obligation.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not, perhaps, difficult to account for the different views, which have been entertained of civil and moral obligation.
<PB N="228" REF="025297_0227_0FCCF50F9AD4A318">
The nature and principles of a government may be &s;uch as to confound many moral and natural relations. In the be&s;t con&s;ti|tuted governments, men may be led to conceive a difference between moral and civil obligation, from the different modes, which they, &s;ometimes, nece&s;&s;arily take to attain the knowlege of public and private duties. The mode of di&s;covery is fre|quently different; but the efficient cau&s;e of obligation, is, in both, the &s;ame.</P>
<P>In all ca&s;es, the efficient cau&s;e of moral obligation ari&s;es from the relations, gene|ral and particular, in which man is placed; the &s;en&s;e, by which he di&s;cerns the&s;e rela|tions, and a perception of the duty thence re&s;ulting.</P>
<P>The utility of the action to be perform|ed, is not the efficient, but the &s;mal cau&s;e, the end, for which the duty is impo&s;ed. The&s;e are not &s;et at variance, but in per|fect harmony. Hence it is, that the gen|eral tendency of any cla&s;s of actions be|comes a &s;afe criterion to decide, whether the performance or forbearance be a du|ty.</P>
<P>The approbation, which a per&s;on feels, of his own conduct, ari&s;es from a direct perception of right in his actions, or, that they coincide with his duty. As a &s;ocial being, he finds the plea&s;ure enhanced,
<PB N="229" REF="025297_0228_0FCCF51463A10090">
from a perception of their utility to &s;ociety. The utility, which ari&s;es to &s;ociety from his actions, becomes a practical proof of the ju&s;tne&s;s of his moral perceptions, and a farther confirmation of his duty. In the common actions of life, the duty is di&s;cov|ered by a direct perception. This is not always the ca&s;e, in the more general and exten&s;ive concerns of &s;ocial and civil life. The &s;ituation is too intricate, the relations too numerous to be at once di&s;covered and comprehended by a direct perception. This often happens in the enacting of laws, particularly in tho&s;e &s;ituations, which oc|cur, in the more active and complicated &s;cenes of civil &s;ociety. The complicated and various, exi&s;ting relations, the re&s;ult of which ought to point out the duty to be impo&s;ed, or the cla&s;s of actions to be re|quired, are not to be di&s;covered and arrang|ed with ea&s;e or certainty, by any direct contemplation. It therefore becomes the principal bu&s;ine&s;s of the legi&s;lator, to re&s;ort to con&s;equences, to examine the probable operation of the law propo&s;ed, the utility of the action to be required, as the only &s;afe criterion, where the re&s;ult of the exi&s;ting relations is not obvious to a direct percep|tion. If he can di&s;cover the actions in|tended to be required, to be u&s;eful in their general tendency, in a civil, &s;ocial, and

moral view, he may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that they will partake of the nature of original, mo|ral obligation; for moral obligation, and final, &s;ocial, and civil utility, ever coincide. The mind, however, frequently occupied with con&s;iderations of utility, is apt to re&s;t &s;atisfied, without &s;eeking any farther grounds of obligation. This has doubtle&s;s concurred with other cau&s;es, to introduce the di&s;tinction attempted by our learned author.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION III.</HI> That Puni&s;hments will have little Effect in the Prevention of Crimes, unle&s;s the Laws are &s;o calculated, that Civil and Moral Obligation coincide.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ole end of puni&s;hment is, or cer|tainly ought to be, the prevention of crimes. Under crimes, I comprehend, not only the doing of tho&s;e things, which are directly detrimental, but the omi&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e, which are nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport and happine&s;s of the community. For if man be a &s;ocial being, it clearly follows, that he is bound, not only to forbear injuries to the
<PB N="231" REF="025297_0230_0FCCF5171157BA50">
&s;ociety, but to contribute an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">qual &s;hare to its &s;upport and happine&s;s. It is not an obligation, ari&s;ing from nece&s;&s;ity merely. It is an original indi&s;pen&s;ible duty.</P>
<P>We have &s;een, that Deity has, by the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t intimate relation, the relation of cau&s;e and effect, connected happine&s;s with the virtuous actions of moral agents, mi&s;ery with their vices. The&s;e are the rewards and puni&s;hments, in the gov|ernment of Providence. To this &s;y&s;tem, as we have &s;een, man, by the original con|&s;titution of his nature, is admirably adapted. He is furni&s;hed with a moral &s;en&s;e, by which he perceives the right and the wrong of his actions. He is al&s;o furni&s;hed with an appetite for the approbation of others. He has, con&s;equently, a dread of their cen&s;ure. Thus he finds him&s;elf ac|countable for his actions. When he per|ceives them to be right, he is intuitively con&s;cious, that he is de&s;erving of appro|bation, when wrong, of cen&s;ure, or puni&s;h|ment. In the &s;ame manner he judges of the actions of others.</P>
<P>To this con&s;titution of nature, all civil laws, and political in&s;titutions ought to be adapted. This alone can produce and &s;upport a coincidence between civil and moral obligation. Upon no other princi|ples will puni&s;hments be perceived to be
<PB N="232" REF="025297_0231_0FCCF518AE036370">
ju&s;t and right. Upon no other principles can they have a &s;alutary effect on the di&s;|po&s;itions, life, and manners of men.</P>
<P>If, in a government, the laws con&s;titute crimes of actions indifferent to the good of &s;ociety, or require, that, which, in general, is detrimental, fear can be the only motive for the ob&s;ervance. In the ca&s;e of a non-ob&s;ervance, there may be an apprehen&s;ion of puni&s;hment, but there will be no con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of de&s;ert. The &s;uffering delin|quent will con&s;ider him&s;elf, not as guilty, but unfortunate. Others will con&s;ider him in the &s;ame light. They will be di&s;|po&s;ed rather to pity his misfortune than to cen&s;ure his conduct, unle&s;s it be for a de|gree of impudence. In &s;uch ca&s;e, puni&s;h|ment tends not to a general or particular prevention of crimes, by a &s;entimental re|formation, the only end, which can ju&s;tify puni&s;hments inflicted by human laws. The direct tendency of &s;uch arbitrary laws is to introduce &s;ophi&s;tical eva&s;ions, and to confound every idea of &s;ocial duty.</P>
<P>The opinion that &s;uch arbitrary laws, for they certainly merit no better appella|tion, are admi&s;&s;ible in government, affords a pretext, for con&s;idering all laws in the &s;ame point of view, and referring all &s;ocial obligation to authority, not to right. The pernicious con&s;equences are obvious.</P>

<P>FROM the different nature or con&s;titu|tion of governments, their principles and the &s;pirit of their laws will be different. Fear, &s;upported by the terror of puni&s;h|ment,
<PB N="234" REF="025297_0233_0FCCF51C5C2060E0">
or a &s;uper&s;titious veneration for the reigning family, or both, are the princi|ples, that is, the great object of the laws, and the &s;ole motive of obedience, in a de&s;|potic government. Monarchy does not lo&s;e &s;ight of the principle of fear, but blends with it, chiefly in regard to the or|der of nobility, the principle of honor, as it is there under&s;tood, a &s;entiment merely per&s;onal, and devoted to all the caprices of opinion. The principle of an ari&s;tocracy, as it relates to the &s;ubject, differs little from de&s;poti&s;m. A republic, or rather a demo|cratic republic has for its principle, that is, the end of its in&s;titution, and the mo|tive of ob&s;ervance, a rational and &s;enti|mental attachment of the people to the community, its laws, and government. A mixed government partakes of all the principles, each of which predominates, in proportion to the prevalence of one or other of its con&s;tituent parts.</P>
<P>Where fear is the governing motive of every &s;ocial action, all happine&s;s in &s;ocial in|tercour&s;e, all &s;ocial improvements, are not neglected only, but are oppo&s;ed by the gen|ius of the government. Blended with fear, however, <HI>honor,</HI> that principle of all the mo&s;t capricious, &s;ometimes irradiates, but more frequently ob&s;cures the &s;ocial horizon. Neither of them have any principal regard
<PB REF="025297_0234_0FCCF51DD61E75D8">
to the happine&s;s of the citizens, or to the intere&s;ts of morality.</P>
<P>The principle of a democratic republic, a &s;entimental attachment to the commu|nity, its in&s;titution and laws, needs not, neither can it endure, the intervention of the other two principles; principles which regard the whole &s;ociety, as con&s;ti|tuted to gratify the pa&s;&s;ions and appetites of one, or a few individuals. Such a mix|ture of heterogeneous principles in a gov|ernment mu&s;t, of nece&s;&s;ity, have a very general effect upon its legi&s;lation, upon the interpretation, and execution of its laws. It will unavoidably dictate many acts and rules of civil conduct, which can, in no view, claim the &s;anction of the moral &s;en&s;e. Such is the government of Great Britain.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit of laws is directed by the ef|fective principle; the principle, by the con&s;titution, or nature of the government. Perhaps, the laws of Great Britain are, in general, the be&s;t, which can con&s;i&s;t with the heterogeneous principles of that govern|ment If this be true, Judge Black&s;tone's di&s;tinction between tho&s;e laws, which are morally, and tho&s;e which are only politic|ally binding, is &s;o far as it applies to tho&s;e laws, ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary. Still it is a &s;evere, though an unde&s;igned &s;troke at the prin|ciples of that government.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="025297_0235_0FCCF520EA258918">Can there be a more &s;ure, a more &s;afe criterion for deciding the goodne&s;s of any government, than the tendency of its principles in legi&s;lation?

<P>THE government of the United States of America exhibits a new &s;cene in the political hi&s;tory of the world; a number of integral republics, each claiming and exerci&s;ing all the powers of internal &s;ove|reignty, within the limits of their re&s;pective juri&s;dictions, formed into one general gov|ernment, with powers of legi&s;lation for all national purpo&s;es, and the power of exe|cuting all their laws, within the &s;everal &s;tates, on the individual citizens, and that independently of the local authority. The experiment was new, and the &s;ucce&s;s has, hitherto, exceeded the mo&s;t &s;anguine expectation of its advocates. A &s;ituation &s;o complicated, &s;o different from that of &s;imple governments, which have been the &s;ubject of the&s;e &s;ketches, will have an effect,

if not upon the laws of nature, from which the general principles are ultimately de|rived, yet to give a different modification to tho&s;e principles, owing to the different combinations and relative circum&s;tances of the con&s;tituent parts; and will have an influence on its organization, and the exe|cution of its laws.</P>
<P>To examine the&s;e principles, and the &s;everal excellences and defects to be found in them, and the national government, to which they have given ri&s;e, is a &s;ubject of importance to every citizen of the Union. The novelty of the &s;ubject, in which the example of other nations furni&s;h little or no light of experience, and in which &s;uffi|cient time has not yet been allowed for a full maturity of ob&s;ervation on the effects of this &s;y&s;tem in operation, renders it a ta&s;k of difficulty, and of dubious &s;ucce&s;s.

<P>The &s;everal American States, while co|lonies, or provinces of the Briti&s;h empire, had, in general, no direct connexion, or governmental dependence on each other.

the common head. There exi&s;ted a &s;imi|larity of manners, which might well be called national. There were, indeed, pro|vincial differences; not greater, however, than are to be found in the i&s;land of Great-Britain, or even in England alone. As Americans, they had little national &s;enti|ment. It was by different channels cen|tred in Great-Britain. Any collected, permanent, national &s;entiment was oppo&s;ed by their foreign connexion. It was the policy of the Briti&s;h government to foment divi&s;ions in the colonies, to a certain de|gree, and to cheri&s;h their local prejudices. The &s;imilarity of their circum&s;tances, how|ever, in the difficulties of making &s;ettlements in a wild, uncultivated country, at a great remove from any part of the civilized world, produced &s;ome degree of direct attachment. This was increa&s;ed by the nece&s;&s;ity of defence again&s;t a common ene|my. Bloody wars waged again&s;t them by the &s;avages, who were in&s;tigated and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed by the French, the ancient enemies of the Engli&s;h, &s;ugge&s;ted the expediency of common coun&s;els, and united excitions. Con&s;ultations were held, by Delegates from the &s;everal provinces; mea&s;ures for the common defence were devi&s;ed, and after|wards executed, in pur&s;uance of their mu|tual coun&s;els. This was the germ of that general u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> and &s;entiments, which produced the American revolution.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="025297_0241_0FCCF52B83109B60">It for a time acquired its utmo&s;t force from the oppre&s;&s;ive mea&s;ures of the Briti&s;h government, which equally affected the liberties of all the colonies, now the United States of America. The fir&s;t inhabitants had brought with them all the democratic principles of the Briti&s;h government and had communicated them, nearly free and unmix|ed, to their de&s;cendants. Their love of liberty, and a knowlege of their rights, was not a little increa&s;ed, both by an equal en|joyment of rights and property under mild and equitable laws, mo&s;tly formed by them&s;elves, and by the di&s;putes, to which extraordinary claims of power, on the part of Great-Britain, had given occa&s;ion. The principles of Monarchy and Ari&s;tocracy, had, however, prevailed, more, or le&s;s, in almo&s;t all the colonial governments. They were, in form, epitomes, of the Briti&s;h government. In each, there was a Gov|ernor, repre&s;enting the King; a Council, repre&s;enting the Hou&s;e of Lords; and an A&s;&s;embly, compo&s;ed of the Repre&s;entatives of the People, the Commons of America. In mo&s;t of the colonies, the Governor and Council were mere creatures of the Crown. They were wholly dependent on the King. He appointed and removed them, as well as the Judges, at plea&s;ure. This created a powerful ari&s;tocratical influence, altoge|ther
<PB N="243" REF="025297_0242_0FCCF52CCC73A710">
ho&s;tile to the liberties and intere&s;ts of the people. Happily, the plan of e&s;tab|li&s;hing a hereditary Nobility in America, was never adopted. Had &s;uch an e&s;tab|li&s;hment been made, at an early day, it would, by &s;ecuring a permanent intere&s;t in the principles of the Briti&s;h government, and by holding out the tempting bait of honors to the more wealthy and influential characters, have firmly, perhaps durably, riveted the &s;hackles of &s;lavery on the Americans.</P>
<P>When the mea&s;ures, which gave ri&s;e to the American revolution, were adopted by the government of Britain, the body of the people had not been corrupted by the&s;e principles. The &s;entiments of attachment, which originated in their de&s;cent from a common &s;tock, and was cheri&s;hed by a &s;i|milarity of circum&s;tances and adventures, had been &s;trengthened by their common coun&s;els, and common exertions, in a long and bloody war. The&s;e common exertions had given them an opinion of their united importance. A more general acquaintance had been introduced, and a reciprocation of coun&s;els and good offices, tended to &s;often and remove tho&s;e local prejudices, which had intervened, and which had been artfully fomented, by the jealous temper of the mother government. A &s;imilarity
<PB N="244" REF="025297_0243_0FCCF52FE69194B8">
of &s;ituation, and a &s;imilarity of danger, from the &s;ame quarter, united their inter|e&s;ts and &s;entiments, and &s;ugge&s;ted the idea of again uniting their coun&s;els, to obtain redre&s;s. This produced the fir&s;t Congre&s;s. A number of delegates from the &s;everal colonies a&s;&s;embled for mutual council, on the common &s;ituation, in which they were placed, by the oppre&s;&s;ive mea&s;ures of the Briti&s;h government, and laid the founda|tion of the American republic.</P>
<P>A &s;econd Congre&s;s was met, when Great Britain commenced her military operations again&s;t what &s;he termed her rebellious col|onies. From that time, a Congre&s;s direct|ed the affairs of America. The fourth of July, 1776, the thirteen colonies were, with their general con&s;ent, declared by Con|gre&s;s, Free and independent States. The &s;everal &s;tates, now independent, adopted or continued republican forms of govern|ment, and entered into articles of confed|eration for their mutual defence, and the direction of national mea&s;ures. The na|tional government which was to be in a Congre&s;s of delegates from the &s;everal &s;tates, had little more than the power of a diplomatic body. They were inve&s;ted with neither the power, nor the means of carrying their ordinances into execution. The &s;tates governments retained the only
<PB N="245" REF="025297_0244_0FCCF53580BAD038">
efficient power within their &s;everal juri&s;|dictions. Common danger, pre&s;&s;ing from every quarter, for a time, united their coun|cils, and &s;upplied a degree of energy to their mea&s;ures, which carried them trium|phantly through the war, and &s;ecured their independence; but the principle of this energy was wholly foreign to the govern|ment. No <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ooner was the war ended, than the total inefficiency of the federal government was di&s;covered. An enor|mous debt had been contracted, and pub|lic credit was in the lowe&s;t and mo&s;t hu|miliating &s;tate of depreciation. Congre&s;s found them&s;elves, in effect, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of neither legi&s;lative nor executive powers. Their ordinances were di&s;regarded. Ma|ny &s;tates neglected or refu&s;ed to furni&s;h their quotas of the national expenditures, the price of their liberty and independ|ence. In &s;ome &s;tates, the treaties made with foreign nations, particularly with Great Britain, were di&s;regarded, or open|ly violated. The authority of Congre&s;s was wholly lo&s;t. The &s;tates had, in effect, become &s;o many independent nations. There was no more a national &s;entiment, or the pur&s;uit of a national intere&s;t. An|cient prejudices, which had &s;ub&s;ided, du|ring the &s;truggle for liberty, were rapidly reviving. Each &s;tate pur&s;uing its local and
<PB N="246" REF="025297_0245_0FCCF53880FEF588">
&s;eparate intere&s;ts, &s;eemed to bid defiance to any national union. The effect of this &s;it|uation began to be apparent in the man|ners of the people, and in the admini&s;tra|tion of the &s;tates governments. They were verging towards the &s;ituation of &s;mall, independent tribes in the &s;ame vi|cinity. This &s;ituation vi&s;ibly contracted the views of the people, and formed them to a &s;pirit of faction. The &s;tates govern|ments were mo&s;tly incapable of pur&s;uing any energetic &s;y&s;tem of admini&s;tration. The whole country was clearly in a &s;tate of civil and political retrogradation.</P>
<P>The effect on the minds of the people was no le&s;s moral than political. A want of public credit, and its concomitant evil, a depreciating paper currency, had nearly ruined their morals, their indu&s;try, and their commerce, as well as private credit. Many other cau&s;es, not nece&s;&s;ary here to enumerate, concurred to heighten the evil. Dangerous in&s;urrections actually exi&s;ted in &s;ome &s;tates, and others trembled in ex|pectation of the like event. Many began to &s;uppo&s;e that the liberty, for which they had ri&s;ked &s;o much blood and trea&s;ure, was but a phantom of the imagination; that an equal enjoyment of rights was, under any arangement, incompatible with political happine&s;s. The wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t
<PB N="247" REF="025297_0246_0FCCF53CB055D338">
citizens had conceived, that an energetic &s;y&s;tem of national government, could a|lone give any rea&s;onable hope of reviving the ruined &s;tate of commerce, of re&s;toring public and private credit, of giving any degree of nationality to the Union, of &s;ecu|ring the faith of public treaties, and in a word, of preventing or repelling the nu|merous impending evils, which threatened to plunge the country into anarchy, and all the horrors of a civil war. Congre&s;s, who were fully &s;en&s;ible of the inefficiency of their powers, to any national purpo&s;e, recommended it to the &s;tates to meet in Convention, by their Delegates, to delib|erate on a plan of national government, which might be equal to the exigencies of the &s;tates. The pre&s;ent con&s;titution of the United States of America, was the re&s;ult of their deliberations. This con&s;ti|tution, as a <HI>unique</HI> in federal politics, orig|inated in an actual, deliberate agreement between the &s;tates, and was ratified by the free con&s;ent of the people of each &s;tate, by their Repre&s;entatives, cho&s;en for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Briefly to examine the principles of this government, both in its organization and operation, and to enquire how far it is a|dapted to the &s;ituation of the country, al|ready divided into &s;eparate &s;tates, will be the &s;ubject of the following &s;ections.</P>

<P>THE political &s;ituation of the American States, occa&s;ioned many anxious appre|hen&s;ions, as to the practicability or expe|diency of con&s;tituting an efficient, national government. It created numerous diffi|culties, which experience alone could ob|viate. It was by many apprehended, that an efficient, national government could not con&s;i&s;t with any con&s;iderable degree of authority, in the &s;tates governments; that it would encounter all the ab&s;urdities of a &s;overeignty within a &s;overeignty; and that one, in the end, mu&s;t be annihilated by the other. According to the various opin|ions concerning the utility and nece&s;&s;ity of an energetic, national government, &s;ome warmly &s;upported, while others deprecated the idea of a collected &s;overeignty. The
<PB N="249" REF="025297_0248_0FCCF5426CF6BE00">
magnitude of the object excited the anxiety of every cla&s;s. Many dreaded an arbitrary power in a general government, uncon|trouled, by the authority of the &s;tates. Some, alarmed at the danger, which threatened a di&s;&s;olution of all national union, and willing to ri&s;k a de&s;perate re|medy, which, they imagined, could alone prove effectual, would readily have &s;acri|ficed the whole authority of the &s;tates, to a national legi&s;lature. They wi&s;hed a con|&s;olidation of the whole into one efficient government.</P>
<P>Others, from a more happy train of thought, or more mature reflection, con|ceived the plan of reconciling the general and particular powers, not &s;o much by a &s;ubordination of one to the other, as by a preci&s;e limitation, in re&s;pect to their &s;everal objects, and rendering them mutually &s;ub|&s;ervient, and even nece&s;&s;ary to each other's efficiency. They perceived, that it was not practicable, perhaps, not even de&s;irable that the &s;ame regulations, the &s;ame mode of holding property, and conducting inter|nal policy, &s;hould take place through the whole. They perceived, that in a country &s;o exten&s;ive, &s;oil, climate, and circum&s;tances, at fir&s;t, accidental, had introduced local differences of manners, habits, intere&s;ts, and pur&s;uits; that the&s;e differences were,
<PB N="250" REF="025297_0249_0FCCF5434F09ABA0">
generally, limited by the limits of the &s;eve|ral &s;tates; that they might give ri&s;e to an emulation in arts and indu&s;try, and lay the foundation of an exten&s;ive national in|tercour&s;e, by way of exchange; but, that it would be impo&s;&s;ible to comprehend them under any general regulations and uniform national laws. There were local legi&s;la|tures already e&s;tabli&s;hed, equal to all local occa&s;ions. They perceived, that the na|tional intere&s;t was not concerned to inter|fere in matters of this nature. The objects of the national <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vernment would be more general. The great idea was to give a national individuality to the &s;tates collect|ively. It was apprehended, that the diffe|rent intere&s;ts, properly repre&s;ented, might be modified, compromi&s;ed, and directed, in &s;uch manner, that in&s;tead of tho&s;e in|terferences and irreconcilable oppo&s;itions, which mu&s;t frequently ari&s;e from too great a degree of independence among the &s;everal &s;tates, they might be bro't to coale&s;ce, and add no le&s;s to the individual, than national pro&s;perity. The point of great difficulty was, to render the acting members of the fe|deral government, accountable, as well to the &s;tates governments, as to the people; and to con&s;titute the federal government, &s;uffi|ciently energetic, to carry into execution, by an authority delegated for that purpo&s;e,
<PB N="251" REF="025297_0250_0FCCF5465694C300">
every nece&s;&s;ary, national mea&s;ure; and yet, &s;o to limit the authority, in exerci&s;e, that no danger might rea&s;onably be appre|hended to the rights of the people, or the &s;tates in their particular juri&s;dictions.</P>
<P>Several in&s;tances occur, both in ancient and modern times, of &s;mall &s;tates confede|rated, with a view to a general union, in the pur&s;uit of national mea&s;ures. The great end in view, and which has always been a de&s;ideratum in federal politics, was to bring the people to have a &s;en&s;e of a national intere&s;t, and all the &s;tates of the confede|racy, effectually to act in concert, in tho&s;e mea&s;ures, which relate immediately to the good of the whole. We may now reckon three principal modes, in which this has been attempted.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t, becau&s;e the mo&s;t ancient mode, is by a council empowered to legi&s;|late upon the &s;everal &s;tates compo&s;ing the confederacy. Of this kind was the Council of the Amphictyons, at the head of the confederated &s;tates of ancient Greece. In this ca&s;e, as none but &s;tates can refu&s;e to obey, a delinquent can be nothing le&s;s than a &s;tate, already provided with arms and councils for a formidable oppo&s;ition. To enforce the decrees of the confederate council, which we may call the laws of the union, it becomes nece&s;&s;ary, in ca&s;e of a
<PB N="252" REF="025297_0251_0FCCF548A0F6BC68">
refu&s;al of any part, to draw out the forces of the complying &s;tates, and to compel obedience by dint of arms. The hi&s;tory of ancient Greece is, for many years, in|famous for a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;uch wars. Such were the Sacred, and many other wars. The famous Peloponne&s;ian war, which raged with almo&s;t unabated fury nearly thirty years, may, in a great mea&s;ure, be attributed to the &s;ame cau&s;e, the want of an efficient power in the national council. Such ever have been, and &s;uch ever will be the effects of this kind of government, unle&s;s, like the late Congre&s;s of the United States of America, they &s;uffer their laws and ordinances to be violated with impuni|ty; and in this ca&s;e, the con&s;equences will be the &s;ame; the government will &s;oon &s;ink to the lowe&s;t point of degradation, and tremble on the brink of evane&s;cence.</P>
<P>The &s;econd mode is, by a council, em|powered to propo&s;e mea&s;ures to the con|federated &s;tates, &s;ubject to the ratification of the &s;tates individually, before they ac|quire the force of laws, or can be carried into execution by the general authority. The government of the United Provinces of the Netherlands, furni&s;hes us with an example of this &s;econd m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">de. The State General are the grand council of the con|federacy. This council, though pomp|ou&s;ly
<PB N="253" REF="025297_0252_0FCCF54B954D4710">
&s;tiled THEIR HIGH MIGHTINESSES, have, in all matters of national concern, whether of greater or le&s;s moment, a power to propo&s;e only. The &s;everal &s;tates have re&s;erved to them&s;elves the right of ratifica|tion. No law can be con&s;titutionally binding, until it have been ratified by each. The <HI>veto</HI> of a &s;ingle &s;tate, and even, in &s;ome in&s;tances, of a &s;ingle corporation, may di&s;concert, and actually has di&s;concerted the national coun&s;els, in mea&s;ures of pre&s;&s;|ing nece&s;&s;ity. Frequently, on great emer|gencies, &s;uch has been the delay, before all the &s;tates could be brought to agree, that the opportunity of acting has been wholly lo&s;t. This has induced the States General, aided by the hereditary Prince of Orange, who, as Stadtholder, admini&s;ters the republic, and who&s;e power and influ|ence are great, &s;ometimes to act without the authority of the &s;maller &s;tates, and even again&s;t their determinations. Such a di&s;regard to the con&s;titutional principles of their union, has, among that people, not remarkable for a &s;pirit of faction, produc|ed high dome&s;tic violences, and convul&s;ed the government, with dangerous in&s;urrec|tions.</P>
<P>The third mode is by an organized go|vernment, impowered, in all matters, which relate to the collective intere&s;ts and pro&s;|perity
<PB N="254" REF="025297_0253_0FCCF54EE3C98790">
of the confederacy, to legi&s;late upon the citizens of the &s;everal &s;tates, as citizens of the Union, and to carry the laws into execution, by mini&s;terial officers of the &s;ame government. Of this form of federal government, we have the fir&s;t com|plete example, in the pre&s;ent con&s;titution of the United States of America. In this government, the National Legi&s;lature, in all matters, which come within the &s;phere of their con&s;titutional authority, legi&s;late, not upon the &s;tates collectively, but upon the citizens of the union. Their mea&s;ures and laws are valid and binding, without any ratification beyond their own act. The con&s;titution, and all acts of authority, warranted by the con&s;titution, are the &s;u|preme law of the land, and binding in all deci&s;ions, as well in the courts of the &s;everal &s;tates, as in the federal courts. To pre|vent different con&s;tructions, which might ari&s;e in different tribunals, under the bias of local authority, influence, or prejudice, the judiciary, for all ca&s;es ari&s;ing under the con&s;titution and laws of the Union, and tho&s;e ca&s;es of public or private controver&s;y, to which the &s;tate juri&s;dictions are incompetent, or, unavoidably liable to a partiality dan|gerous to general ju&s;tice, hold their offices by appointment of the &s;upreme power of the confederacy, and are amenable only to
<PB N="255" REF="025297_0254_0FCCF5500E27D720">
that power, and their deci&s;ions are carried into effect by mini&s;terial officers appointed under the &s;ame authority.</P>
<P>While the federal government is ve&s;ted with the &s;upreme authority, in all matters, which involve the general welfare of the Union, con&s;idered in a national view, the &s;tates governments, within the limits of their &s;everal juri&s;dictions, retain, as &s;ove|reign, all tho&s;e powers, which, in their due admini&s;tration, mo&s;t endear the civil &s;tate to mankind. To them it belongs, among their own citizens, to regulate the mode of acquiring, and to &s;ecure the acqui&s;ition of property, to animadvert upon morals, and to re&s;train and puni&s;h tho&s;e crimes, which attack private property, violate per|&s;onal &s;ecurity, or in any way, di&s;turb the peace of their communities.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION III.</HI> Organization and Powers of the Federal Government.&mdash;Limitation of its Powers. &mdash;Principles of Accountability.&mdash;Brief View of its effects in Practice.</HEAD>
<P>THE government of the United States of America is con&s;tituted with legi&s;lative, judicial, and executive powers, ve&s;ted in di&s;tinct and &s;eparate departments. The legi&s;lative power is ve&s;ted in a Congre&s;s, con&s;i&s;ting of a Senate, and Hou&s;e of Re|pre&s;entatives, who&s;e powers in legi&s;lation are mutual. The Repre&s;entatives are cho&s;|en by the people of the &s;everal &s;tates, every &s;econd year, and are apportioned by the number of people in each &s;tate, to be a&s;certained by an actual enumeration, tak|en once in every ten years.</P>
<P>The qualifications for the Electors of the Repre&s;entatives are not reduced to a uniform rule throughout the Union; but are to be the &s;ame in each &s;tate, as for the electors of the mo&s;t numerous branch of the &s;tate legi&s;lature. To be eligible, as a re|pre&s;entative, three qualifications are nece&s;|&s;ary, neither of which introduce any odious di&s;tinction of cla&s;&s;es. To be eligible, a
<PB N="257" REF="025297_0256_0FCCF55731A54A20">
per&s;on, mu&s;t have attained the age of twenty-five years, have been &s;even years a citizen of the United States, and at the time of his being elected, an inhabitant of the &s;tate, for which he is elected. Property is, in mo&s;t of the &s;tates, a qualification, both of electors and candidates; &s;o far it is a qualification for the electors of the federal repre&s;entatives; but not for candi|dates. Hence it may happen, that a per&s;on may be elected, who has not a right of &s;uffrage in the election. This is, at lea&s;t, a &s;light incon&s;i&s;tency, which it would have been de&s;irable to have avoided, by extend|ing, more equally and uniformly, the right of &s;uffrage. It is probable, however, that difficulties, on this point, would have ari&s;en from an attachment to local u&s;ages.</P>
<P>The Senate of the United States is com|po&s;ed of two Senators from each &s;tate, cho&s;en by the Legi&s;lature. The Senators are divided into three cla&s;&s;es. The &s;eats of one cla&s;s are vacated every &s;econd year, and the vacancies &s;upplied by the legi&s;la|tures of the &s;tates, to which the &s;enators of &s;uch cla&s;s re&s;pectively belong. Their election is, therefore, in reality, &s;exennial, and the &s;enate can never be compo&s;ed of more than one third new members. There are three qualifications for a &s;enator &mdash; He mu&s;t have attained the age of thirty
<PB N="258" REF="025297_0257_0FCCF5584C7796E0">
years, have been nine years a citizen of the United States, and at the time of his elec|tion, be an inhabitant of the &s;tate, for which he is cho&s;en.</P>
<P>We may, with &s;atisfaction ob&s;erve, that in the qualifications of the &s;enators, there is no feature of ari&s;tocracy, nothing, which tends to a di&s;tinction of ranks. The qua|lifications, both of the &s;enators and repre|&s;entatives, tend only to &s;ecure in the fede|ral legi&s;lature, a maturity of experience and abilities, an attachment to the national intere&s;t, and the intere&s;ts of the re&s;pective &s;tates.</P>
<P>Each Hou&s;e chu&s;e their own officers, except, that the Vice-Pre&s;ident of the United States, for the time being, is Pre&s;i|dent of the Senate, and are &s;ole judges of the elections, returns, and qualifications of their own members. The times and plac|es of holding elections for &s;enators are pre|&s;cribed by the legi&s;lature of each &s;tate; but Congre&s;s have power, by law, to make, or alter &s;uch regulations, except, as to the place of electing &s;enators. This exception was made, that Congre&s;s might not have it in their power to remove the &s;tate legi&s;|latures from place to place, at their plea&s;ure. Would it not have tended to &s;ecure a more equal repre&s;entation of the national intere&s;ts, and a more ready acquie&s;cence in
<PB N="259" REF="025297_0258_0FCCF55B10D24E10">
the laws of the Union, had a con&s;titutional provi&s;ion been made, for a divi&s;ion of each &s;tate, in the election of repre&s;entatives, into di&s;tricts, agreeably to a ju&s;t apportion|ment? I apprehend it to be of &s;ufficient importance to claim a place among the laws of the con&s;titution. Congre&s;s are to a&s;&s;emble, at lea&s;t, once in every year. Each Hou&s;e is to keep a journal of its proceed|ings; and to publi&s;h the &s;ame from time to time, with the yeas and nays, which are to be taken and entered on every que&s;|tion, if de&s;ired by one fifth of the members pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide the ordinary powers of legi&s;la|tion, the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives have the &s;ole power, in the national government, of bringing impeachments, and the &s;enate have the &s;ole power of trying &s;uch im|peachments.</P>
<P>No bill can pa&s;s into a law, without the concurrence of both hou&s;es, and bills may indifferently originate in either.

the peace, happine&s;s, and pro&s;perity of the whole require &s;hould be exerci&s;ed by the national government alone. To prevent an evil, of a tendency &s;o fatal, in a national view, is apparently the principal end of all the limitations on the powers of the &s;everal &s;tates, and their legi&s;lative bodies. The federal government, de&s;igned to embrace only general, and national objects, and not extend to the merely internal regulations and policy of the individual &s;tates, it was found, in re&s;pect to its objects, to be le&s;s involved, and its powers capable of a more preci&s;e enumeration and definition. For this rea&s;on few, and tho&s;e pretty general limitations of the powers of the federal government, are in&s;erted. In&s;tead of particular, enumerated in&s;tances, in which its powers are limited, the &s;ame end is more fully attainted, by a declaration, which, in effect, denies to Congre&s;s, the exerci&s;e of any farther, or other powers, than tho&s;e, which are delegated by the con&s;titution, and re&s;erves to the &s;tates and the people, all tho&s;e powers and rights, which are not &s;o delegated. This, as it takes away every pretence for claiming con&s;tructive powers, in derogation of the powers of the &s;tates, and the rights of their re&s;pective citizens, if not the only effectual, is clearly the &s;afe&s;t mode of li|miting

the powers of a government thus con&s;tituted.</P>
<P>The accountability of the rulers is a prominent feature, in the federal con&s;titu|tion. In &s;ecuring this important object, great attention has been paid to the pecu|liarity of the &s;ituation of the con&s;tituent members, both as &s;tates, and as citizens. The &s;enators of the United States, appointed by the legi&s;latures of the &s;everal &s;tates, and from time to time amenable to them, may well be con&s;idered as guardians of the rights of their re&s;pective &s;tates again&s;t all eneroachments of the national govern|ment.</P>

<P>The right which once in four years, de|volves on the legi&s;latures of the &s;everal &s;tates, of appointing the electors of the Pre&s;ident and Vice-Pre&s;ident of the United States, or of directing their appointment by the people, &s;ecures to the &s;tates and to the people, a powerful check on the executive of the federal government.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="025297_0276_0FCCDA3E148480A0">The judges, appointed by the Pre&s;ident, with the advice of the &s;enate, to hold their offices during good behavior, &s;ecure of their compen&s;ation, without the fear of diminu|tion, and &s;ubjected with all other officers of the national government, to removal by impeachment, and puni&s;hment by the laws of the land, for male-admini&s;tration, are placed in a &s;tate of accountability, blended with a degree of independence, from which can alone be expected an inflexible integrity of conduct, in that department.</P>
<P>This con&s;titution of government, found|ed in the &s;ame principles as the con&s;titutions of the &s;everal &s;tates in the Union, as nearly as the relative &s;ituations admit, and formed on the &s;ame plan, exhibits, in theory, the mo&s;t beautiful &s;y&s;tem, which has yet been devi&s;ed by the wi&s;dom of man. It is true, that this form of federal government is a new phenomenon in the political world. Hardly a &s;hadow of &s;uch principles and powers, as it relates to the practice and execution, in a federal union of &s;tates, is to be found in the hi&s;tory of ancient or modern politics. In this age of improvements, no le&s;s in the &s;cience of government, than in other &s;ciences, its novelty will not be made a &s;erious objec|tion; yet it mu&s;t be acknowleged, that the con&s;i&s;tency of the&s;e principles in opera|tion,
<PB N="278" REF="025297_0277_0FCCF587D8A08508">
and their efficiency, in point of prac|tice, might &s;till be con&s;idered as problema|tical, had they not, in a good mea&s;ure, been evinced by actual experiment. Solely an impre&s;&s;ion of the efficiency of the federal government, favored, perhaps, by its na|tional magnitude and importance, added, at the in&s;tant of its organization, a degree of energy to the &s;tates governments, and put an end to tho&s;e factions and turbulent commotions, which made &s;ome of them tremble for their political exi&s;tence. The legi&s;latures of the &s;everal &s;tates, under the au&s;pices of this government, appear to have exploded their former &s;y&s;tems of local and temporary expediency, and founding them&s;elves more generally on the ba&s;is of moral and national ju&s;tice, have given a force and con&s;i&s;tency to their laws, and in|&s;pired a confidence among the citizens, the want of which had almo&s;t annihilated private credit. The authority of the fe|deral government rendered this confidence general and reciprocal. Its beneficial in|fluence was not confined to the limits of the Union. It extended to di&s;tant countries, and produced the happie&s;t effects in the commercial intercour&s;e of the citizens with foreign nations.</P>
<P>The admini&s;tration of this government, by di&s;covering the national re&s;ources,
<PB N="279" REF="025297_0278_0FCCF58973839F40">
uniting and directing them to the proper objects, by an almo&s;t in&s;tantaneous impul&s;e, re&s;tored public credit and national faith, which had long been in a &s;tate bordering on de&s;peration, to a degree of re&s;pectability, of which few examples are to be found in the hi&s;tory of nations. The&s;e operations afforded means, and added vigor to indu&s;|try among every cla&s;s of citizens. Agri|culture, commerce, arts, and manufactures, have felt a new, and more powerful &s;timu|lus. The &s;pirit of enterpri&s;e, without which nothing great is ever to be expected, has, by the exten&s;ivene&s;s of the pro&s;pects, and the magnitude of the objects pre&s;ented, been productive of effects, of which the Americans had, before, hardly entertained a conception. In &s;uch a change of cir|cum&s;tances, &s;uch a novelty of pro&s;pects and &s;ecurity of hope, an intemperance in the &s;pirit of enterpri&s;e was, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to be expected. Accordingly, in too ma|ny in&s;tances, it degenerated into &s;peculating projects, the influence of which on morals were, for the moment, no le&s;s pernicious, than the depreciating &s;y&s;tem, which pre|ceded. This ought, however, to be attri|buted to its proper cau&s;e, the former extent and degraded &s;tate of paper credit. In applying a remedy to an evil, &s;o univer&s;ally inveterate, this effect ought to be con&s;idered,
<PB N="280" REF="025297_0279_0FCCF58AD76EEAA8">
rather as the la&s;t malignant effort of the evil, than an indication of the un&s;uitable|ne&s;s of the remedy.</P>
<P>The wi&s;dom, ju&s;tice, and equality of the laws enacted under the federal govern|ment, and con&s;equently the beneficial in|fluence of its principles, are &s;trongly evinced by the prompt ob&s;ervance of a free and enlightened people. Compared with the extent and variety of tran&s;actions, which, &s;ince the adoption of this government, have employed every cla&s;s of citizens, the courts of the Union have in few in&s;tances, been called to animadvert on a breach of its laws.</P>
<P>The experience, which we have already had, is &s;ufficient to found a confidence, not only in the efficiency of the federal government; but in the coincidence of its principles, with the laws of civil and &s;ocial nature, and the pre&s;ent &s;tate of manners and knowlege.</P>

<P>MONTESQUIEU, &s;peaking of that kind of government, which was e&s;tabli&s;hed through Europe, by the conquerors of the Roman empire, &s;ays, "It was a good government, that had in it&s;elf a capacity of growing better."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sp. I. B. ix. Ch. 8. in the note.</NOTE> This capacity of grow|ing better, was not the effect of any direct intention of the founders, nor, if perceived, was it ever pur&s;ued. Accordingly we have &s;een this kind of government, almo&s;t uni|ver&s;ally, degenerating into a &s;pecies of de&s;|poti&s;m. If any government have admited improvements, the&s;e improvements have never been deliberately made, in con&s;e|quence of any fixed plan of reformation adopted in the con&s;titution. They have been con&s;tantly introduced by viole<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, or in a concurrence of circum&s;tances, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le if at all intended or fore&s;een.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="025297_0281_0FCCF58F42AA0D78">Notwith&s;tanding the foregoing ob&s;erva|tion of Monte&s;quieu, he appears to join in an opinion, which has very generally pre|vailed, that governments, like men, from a nece&s;&s;ity of nature, carry in them&s;elves, from their very origin, the feeds of di&s;&s;olu|tion; that man is fatally incapable of forming any &s;y&s;tem, which &s;hall endure without degenerating. This opinion &s;eems to be countenanced by the experience of ages. I am apprehen&s;ive, however, that on enquiry, we &s;hall find rea&s;on for a dif|ferent opinion. A more general develope|ment of the laws of human nature, may di&s;cover, that, though in the infancy of mankind, from which, perhaps tho&s;e na|tions, who have made the greate&s;t advances, have hardly emerged, this may be true; yet man is, by nature, capable of improve|ments, which may render an amelioration in government as ea&s;y and familiar as in any &s;cience. The &s;ame fate has attended all &s;ciences of more difficult inve&s;tigation. Their e&s;tabli&s;hment and improvement have generally been attempted by rea&s;onings <HI>a priori,</HI> in which imagination is the principal agent. It has fared in the &s;ame manner with the various &s;y&s;tems of natural philo|&s;ophy, morality, and theology, which have &s;ucceeded each other in the world.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="025297_0282_0FCCF591D3E72760">Within little more than a century, ex|perimental rea&s;onings have bani&s;hed almo&s;t innumerable ab&s;urdities, and in many &s;ci|ences, &s;eem to have laid a foundation of knowlege, as fixed and as durable, as the cour&s;e of nature. It is at length perceived, that the operations of nature are &s;ubjected to certain laws, e&s;tabli&s;hed by Deity, in the con&s;titution of things; and, that nothing can be durable, which is calculated to thwart tho&s;e laws, or divert them from their cour&s;e. Man, and all the works of man, no le&s;s than inert matter, are &s;ubjected to tho&s;e laws. States, kingdoms and em|pires, if they admit principles, which thwart the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of nature, like heaps of &s;and, oppo&s;ed to the re&s;i&s;tle&s;s force of a torrent, are inevitably &s;wept into the gulf of di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>The laws of nature, we have before ob|&s;erved, are immutable; not &s;o the relations, from which they re&s;ult; or the particular &s;ituations, in which tho&s;e laws were de|&s;igned to operate. This may need &s;ome illu&s;tration.</P>
<P>Matter is found exi&s;ting, under modifica|tions infinitely various, and is denominated of different kinds. Different kinds of matter, endued with what we call different powers, are found to have certain relations to each other, as well in the more &s;imple, as in the
<PB N="284" REF="025297_0283_0FCCF59319DECD80">
more intricate and comprehen&s;ive combin|ations. In all the variety of ways, in which they may be combined, each particular com|bination, invariably produces the &s;ame par|ticular effect. If the combination be chang|ed, the relations are changed. It comes un|der a different law, and a different effect is produced. All kinds of inert matter are in|capable, from any internal power, which they po&s;&s;e&s;s, of changing their combination, or of altering the pre&s;ent exi&s;ting relations. If any change or alteration be made, it mu&s;t ari&s;e from &s;omething external. Hence, in the natural world, the cour&s;e of effects is uniform, becau&s;e the relations and &s;itua|tions of them&s;elves continue uniform. In the moral world it is different. Man has both active and pa&s;&s;ive powers; both intelligence and volition to direct their operations. He is capable of changing the relative &s;ituation of things, both in re&s;pect to him&s;elf, and in re&s;pect to the different kinds of matter, which are &s;ubjected to his operations. Hence the relative &s;itua|tion, being le&s;s uniform, effects and events, both natural and moral, as they relate to him, will be le&s;s uniform. The relations of matter, and the laws of its operation, are to the material agents, irre&s;i&s;tible; not &s;o the laws of moral action. The laws of moral action re&s;pect the de&s;ign of the
<PB N="285" REF="025297_0284_0FCCF596F629AD48">
agent, in connexion with the means and the end, both general and particular. The laws of matter have no re&s;pect to the de&s;ign of the material agents. The one is obligatory, and precedes the action: the other is ne|ce&s;&s;ary, and accompanies the operation.</P>
<P>For the&s;e, among other rea&s;ons, the laws of moral agents, by which their actions are produced and governed, and the events, which re&s;pect them, directed, are not &s;o ea&s;ily under&s;tood, or &s;o fully comprehend|ed, as the laws of matter.</P>
<P>To an omni&s;cient Being, indeed, the former are as perfectly intelligible as the latter. We know likewi&s;e, that men are capable of acquiring much knowlege on the &s;ubject, and that &s;ome of more com|prehen&s;ive minds, and clo&s;er ob&s;ervation, are capable of tracing the laws of human actions, even in many very intricate com|binations, and of calculating upon their general operations, in given &s;ituations, with no incon&s;iderable degree of certainty. This is, indeed, the only &s;olid foundation of political &s;cience. Political and civil laws are de&s;igned to regulate the future actions of men, as they ari&s;e in &s;ociety, and to pro|duce &s;uch relations, as are dictated by the laws of &s;ocial nature. Knowlege equal to this ta&s;k is the re&s;ult, only of accumulated experience. But a nece&s;&s;ity for civil in|&s;titutions
<PB N="286" REF="025297_0285_0FCCF5991E1CC938">
ari&s;es antecedent to experience. Civil in&s;titutions have generally been the rude productions of nece&s;&s;ity, and the form originally impo&s;ed by fraud, violence, or what, to men, are the mere &s;ugge&s;tions of chance. Men have commonly regarded only &s;ome of the mo&s;t obvious, the mo&s;t predominant, exi&s;ting relations, with little knowlege of the change in the pre&s;ent relations, which would be the nece&s;&s;ary effect of their in&s;titutions, or of the future improvement of the &s;pecies. Indeed, could every individual in &s;ociety, have an intuitive pre&s;cience of the changes, as they were to ari&s;e, in their order, it would &s;till, perhaps, be impo&s;&s;ible to form any human in&s;titu|tion, which &s;hould accommodate it&s;elf to every &s;ituation in the progre&s;s. Intere&s;t, with &s;ome, an habitual veneration for anci|ent e&s;tabli&s;hments, with all, an opinion of the pre&s;ent perfection of government, and a dread of encouraging a &s;pirit of innova|tion, the bane of a well regulated &s;ociety, have concured to prevent any regular plan of fundamental reformation in government, and to continue, as unalterably perfect, tho&s;e in&s;titutions, which were adapted only to the weakne&s;s, ignorance, and barbarous manners of an infant people.</P>
<P>By the force of habit, and inveterate national prejudices, abu&s;es are rendered
<PB N="287" REF="025297_0286_0FCCF59A5A197908">
&s;acred, and not unfrequently, come to be con&s;idered as rightful privileges; and tho&s;e in&s;titutions, which were the offspring of chance or violence, to be extolled as the mo&s;t perfect productions of rea&s;on, founded in the original and unalterable principles of nature. Such was the Briti&s;h govern|ment, and &s;uch has been the force of hab|itual prejudice upon the people of that kingdom. That government has, indeed, received, many improvements, with the improvements of the age; but they have generally been wre&s;ted by force from the reigning powers, or interpo&s;ed in a revo|lution of the crown. Many re&s;pectable characters long con&s;idered them as &s;o many violations of the mo&s;t &s;acred rights. The greater part of the nation appear fully per&s;uaded, that all farther improvements are impracticable, and that becau&s;e their government was once the be&s;t, perhaps, which exi&s;ted in the world, it mu&s;t, through all the progre&s;&s;ive advances in knowlege, in morals, and in manners, continue the be&s;t, a pattern of unchanging perfection, though, in its principles, it is much too limited for the pre&s;ent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">te. It is probable that all improvement <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> will be oppo&s;ed and prevented by tho&s;e in power, who are intere&s;ted in the pre&s;ent order of things, till the improvements of an
<PB N="288" REF="025297_0287_0FCCF59BD60DA528">
enlightened age, &s;hall produce a violent concu&s;&s;ion in the combat with ancient prejudices, and &s;truggle through a &s;cene of tumult, outrage, and perhaps civil war, to arrive at &s;ome incon&s;iderable amelioration, in their con&s;titution.</P>
<P>In the progre&s;s of &s;ocial improvements, there u&s;ually ari&s;es a repugnancy, between the principles of the government, and the pre&s;ent morals and manners of the people. Hence we may learn to account for the con&s;tant &s;uperiority, in mo&s;t nations, of private to political morality, as practi&s;ed by the &s;ame individuals. The principles of a government, adapted to the limited occa&s;ions of a &s;imple and infant &s;tate of &s;ociety, tend in oppo&s;ition to the progre&s;s of improvement, or to divert it into partial and devious channels. This mu&s;t have a very pernicious effect, as well upon the admini&s;tration of the government, as upon the morals, habits, and manners of the people. From this &s;ource, principally, has proceeded that corruption in the ad|mini&s;tration of government, that degenera|cy in the manners of the people, which has perpetually proved the ruin of the mo&s;t celebrated civil in&s;titutions.</P>
<P>The con&s;ining of a people, who have arrived at a highly improved &s;tate of &s;oci|ety, to the forms and principles of a gov|ernment,
<PB N="289" REF="025297_0288_0FCCF59E753CF7A0">
which originated in a &s;imple, if not barbarous &s;tate of men and manners, may not unaptly be compared to a cu&s;tom, which prevails among the Chine&s;e. A &s;mall foot being reckoned the highe&s;t point of beauty, it is the univer&s;al practice with them, to confine the feet of their female infants, to prevent their growth. When arrived at maturity, the feet of the Chine&s;e women, it is &s;aid, do not exceed in &s;ize tho&s;e of an infant of &s;ix months old; &s;o that from the di&s;proportion of tho&s;e members to the weight of the body, they appear rather to totter than walk. No le&s;s aukwardne&s;s of &s;ituation, no le&s;s perver&s;ion of nature mu&s;t take place, in a nation, where the improvement of its civil and political in&s;titutions are limited, and not &s;uffered to proceed in any degree of equality with the general improvements of the people.</P>
<P>In this point, the con&s;titution of the United States of America, is di&s;tingui&s;hed from all other national e&s;tabli&s;hment. It is not pretended to have attained the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">chme of perfection, to the exclu&s;ion of future improvements. It is calculated to admit amendments, corre&s;ponding with the pro|gre&s;s of the citizens in &s;ocial improvements, and political &s;cience. The idea of incor|porating, in the con&s;titution it&s;elf, a plan
<PB N="290" REF="025297_0289_0FCCF5A054021DB8">
of reformation, which, without encourag|ing a &s;pirit of innovation, the parent of anarchy and final de&s;poti&s;m, might enable the people, with deliberation, and more mature experience, to correct what &s;hould be, at any time, found wrong in the form, principles, or operation of the government, was fir&s;t adopted, in practice, in &s;ome of the individual &s;tates of the confederacy. It had been found, not only practicable and &s;afe in the exerci&s;e, but its happy effect in ameliorating the fundamental principles of the government, had, in &s;everal in&s;tanc|es, been fully evinced. This idea was taken up and pur&s;ued in framing the con|&s;titution of government for the United States. It is made a fundamental article of that con&s;titution, that "Congre&s;s, when|ever two thirds of both hou&s;es &s;hall deem it nece&s;&s;ary, &s;hall propo&s;e amendments to the con&s;titution, or on application of two thirds of the &s;everal &s;tates, &s;hall call a con|vention for propo&s;ing amendments, which in either ca&s;e &s;hall be valid to all intents and purpo&s;es, as parts of the con&s;titution, when ratified by the legi&s;latures of three fourths of the &s;everal &s;tates, or by conven|tions in three fourths thereof, as the one, or the other mode of ratification may be propo&s;ed by Congre&s;s." There are &s;ome re&s;trictions on the power of making
<PB N="291" REF="025297_0290_0FCCF5A1F15B6BF8">
amendments. Among other things it is provided, that no &s;tate &s;hall, without its con&s;ent, be deprived of its equal &s;uffrage in the &s;enate.</P>
<P>In virtue of the power ve&s;ted in Con|gre&s;s, and re&s;erved to the people and the &s;tates, by this article, &s;everal important amendments have already been adopted in the federal con&s;titution; and we have rea&s;on to believe, that whatever, on expe|rience, &s;hall be found deficient in principle, will be added; whatever &s;hall be found dangerous to the rights of the people or the &s;tates, or impracticable in operation, will be retrenched and corrected. The wi&s;dom, which formed it, aided and ma|tured by experience, may, not only extend its principles, with the progre&s;s of &s;ocial improvements, but carry it to a greater degree of practical perfection than any thing, which has yet been known in go|vernment.</P>
<P>Let us not, then, ra&s;hly, or from the pride of a prophetic &s;pirit, conclude that this beautiful &s;y&s;tem is, with the crazy empires of antiquity, de&s;tined to a &s;peedy di&s;&s;olution; or that it mu&s;t in time, thro' the degeneracy of the people, and a cor|ruption of its principles, of nece&s;&s;ity give place to a &s;y&s;tem of remedile&s;s tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion. Let us rather, while we con|ceive

a rational hope, that it will endure as long as the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive generations of men, attend, with the calmne&s;s of philo|&s;ophy, and the per&s;evering zeal of patriot|i&s;m, to the enjoyment of its ble&s;&s;ings, and the improvement of its principles.
