<HEAD>REASONS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS I have been a profe&s;&s;or among the People called <HI>Shakers,</HI> and have zealou&s;ly labored, both in public and private, (whereof many hundreds are witne&s;&s;es) to promote and build up the profe&s;&s;ion; but have of late &s;eparated my&s;elf from that people, it &s;eemed to me not unrea&s;onable and no more than what might be ju&s;tly expected, that I &s;hould &s;hew &s;ome rea&s;on or cau&s;e for &s;o doing. In order for this I &s;hall endeavor to give a &s;hort account of my life and expe|riences, from my youth up to this time, including my manner of faith before I heard of this people, the manner of my en|tering in among them, and the faith I received in hearing their te&s;timony, and my per&s;everence in it. Together with my tri|als and tribulations which I have had of late, which has effected my &s;eparation. Avoiding, if po&s;&s;ible, every thing that may create or increa&s;e a &s;pirit of hatred or envy again&s;t this people, for it is to be lamented there is a great deal too much already. But as it is my purpo&s;e and intention only &s;imply to &s;tate my rea&s;ons, and &s;ubmit the matter to God the judge of all, I hope it may give no offence, neither to Jew nor Gentile, nor to the Church of God.</P>
<P>To give a particular account of my life, and the exerci&s;es of my mind from the days of my infancy, would be a labor too tedious for me to endure at this time, as my health is much impaired by a continued &s;eries of afflictions But I &s;hall only &s;ay, that from the time I began to know between good and evil, till I was about eighteen years of age, a great part of the time my mind was exerci&s;ed with fearful and awful apprehen|&s;ions of a future judgment; &s;ometimes to that degree, that I could wi&s;h my&s;elf a <HI>toad</HI> or a <HI>&s;nake</HI> or any thing that had no &s;oul to exi&s;t in futurity. At length I was brought to expe|rience a change of &s;en&s;ation, the particulars of which may not be nece&s;&s;ary to relate now. but I was made to love God for what he was in him&s;elf: I had &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of the love of God, through the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for the &s;alvation and happine&s;s of his creatures, that I was no more afraid what he would do with me; but was determined to &s;erve and obey God to the end of my days. Here I mu&s;t ob&s;erve one thing (as I mean to be an hone&s;t man) which I have made u&s;e of in &s;upport of one principle of faith, which I afterwards received among this people called <HI>Shakers</HI>&mdash;the thing I mean is this, I had ob&s;er|ved in the cour&s;e of my life that one of the greate&s;t things that operated upon the minds of young people, was a connection
<PB N="4" REF="038359_0003_1011C9AD7B269018">between <HI>male</HI> and <HI>female,</HI> the mode or manner in which it was carried on, (which is needle&s;s for me to relate) made it appear to me like an earthly &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure, &s;o that when my heart was full of love to God, and was re&s;olved to for&s;ake all car|nal enjoyments, for the &s;ervice of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, I though<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> I could never get a wife without laying a&s;ide my religion. This I ob&s;erved to &s;ome of my friends at the time: But although I felt this fen&s;ation for my&s;elf, yet I did not doubt but what it might be right for men and women to marry and propagate their &s;pecies; but whether I was overmuch righteous or not, is a matter I choo&s;e to leave for the pre&s;ent, and proceed farther, as to the change of &s;en&s;ation which I received. Doubtle&s;s it was thought by profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians in general, to be the new birth, or real conver&s;ion, by which the foul is entitled to the kingdom of Heaven: But as for my own part I never pretended to &s;ay whether it was or was not; but my hope of everla&s;ting life was in loving the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and obeying his go&s;pel&mdash;believing that what was contained in the &s;criptures was a &s;ufficient rule to walk by, and by which I &s;hould be judged at the la&s;t day.</P>
<P>However, after &s;ome time, forgetting the commandments of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to watch and pray always, or, at lea&s;t, not attending to it, I became carnally minded, and lo&s;t, in a great mea&s;ure, my confidence towards God, and that life and comfort which I had before enjoyed. At length, in the &s;pring of the year 1780 I heard a rumour of a &s;trange people at <HI>Ni&s;|kauna,</HI> that was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of remarkable gifts and power, and held to &s;trange doctrines, &s;uch as I had never heard before, one thing particular, which drew my attention, was the <HI>cro&s;s</HI> a|gain&s;t the fle&s;h (as it is called,) or denying all matrimonial con|nection between <HI>male</HI> and <HI>female,</HI> &amp;c. This brought to my mind what I had felt before in my&s;elf; and I rather believed it mu&s;t be of God, although I had never &s;earched the &s;cripture, to &s;ee if it was agreeable to the &s;acred record: But as num|bers of my friends and acquaintance &s;oon went to &s;ee them, and brought back very wonderful reports which increa&s;ed my faith, &s;o that I was re&s;olved to go and &s;ee them for my&s;elf; not doubting but what they were the people of God&mdash;at length, &s;ome time in July 1780, I went with a number of oth|ers to &s;ee them, at <HI>Ni&s;kauna,</HI> to hear and &s;ee for my&s;elf, and having an opportunity then, and from time to time, after I received the following principles of faith: viz. But fir&s;t, I de&s;ire to be under&s;tood, what I am going to relate as the prin|ciples of my faith, is not what I &s;ugge&s;ted in my&s;elf, but what I really heard preached, either from the fir&s;t mini&s;ters, or from others that were authorized by them to preach: that is, That the <HI>great and la&s;t day</HI> had began&mdash;that the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t had made his &s;econd appearance in that per&s;on which
<PB N="5" REF="038359_0004_1011C9B0C3B956B0">was called the <HI>mother</HI>&mdash;hat &s;he was redeemed from all &s;in, and &s;tood without fault before the throne of God&mdash;that the fulne&s;s of the Godhead dwelt in her bodily, as really as it did in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t in his fir&s;t appearance, and as much greater as his &s;econd appearance was to be greater than the fir&s;t. I under&s;tood and believed that &s;he was the woman &s;po|ken of in the 12th chapter of Rev. and in Jeremiah 31&s;t chap. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d ver&s;e, that as the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t was the &s;econd <HI>Adam,</HI> &s;o &s;he was the &s;econd <HI>Eve</HI>&mdash;that as the fir&s;t <HI>Eve</HI> was fir&s;t in the tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion which effected the fall of the human race, &s;o &s;he, as the &s;econd <HI>Eve,</HI> had the fir&s;t gift &amp; revelation of God, to effect com|pletely the re&s;toration from the fall, which was to be redeemed and delivered wholly from the power, &s;pirit, and nature, that produced natural generation, which was &s;aid to be the forbid|den fruit that was in the mid&s;t of the garden, that our fir&s;t pa|rents were forbidden to touch upon pain of death. I believed that regeneration &s;ignified the re&s;urrection from the dead, that Chri&s;t &s;poke of in Luke, 20th chapter, 35th and 36th ver&s;es. where he &s;ays, "But they which &s;hall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the re&s;urrection from the dead, nei|ther marry nor are given in marriage, neither can they die any more, for they are equal unto the angels, and are the children of God, being the children of the re&s;urrection." I believed that the mother with &s;ome others which were with her, &s;tood completely in the re&s;urrection, and were equal unto the angels, and were conver&s;ant and familiar with invi&s;ible beings in a &s;piritual world, and that they were not &s;ubject to any natural di&s;orders or infirmities which were incident to the re&s;t of mankind&mdash;I believed that God had given them the &s;pirit and power of judgment, to judge the world both quick and dead, and that their power and te&s;timony would increa&s;e till it &s;hould gather all Nations, and &s;et them on the right hand or on the left, according to what is written in Mathew, 25th chapter and 31&s;t ver&s;e: and &s;oon I believed the day and time had commenced which was prophecied of, in I&s;aiah, 2d chapter and 2d ver&s;e, &amp;c. and in Daniel 2d chapter and 44th ver&s;e; and 7th chapter, 9th and 10th ver&s;es; and in I&s;ai|ah 65th chapter, 17th ver&s;e, and &s;o on; and in Revelations, 20th and 21&s;t chapters. Many more places might be mention|ed which purport the &s;ame thing, but perhaps it is not nece&s;|&s;ary.</P>
<P>All this I &s;ay I believed, without the lea&s;t doubt, and my labor and concern was to come into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that which I had faith in. In order for this I was taught, I mu&s;t confe&s;s all my &s;ins: this I did willingly and hone&s;tly; believing my&s;elf to be before the bar of <HI>eternal ju&s;tice,</HI> where the thoughts and intents of my heart were fully and clearly &s;een and known I was al&s;o taught, that I mu&s;t take up my cro&s;s again&s;t all &s;in;
<PB N="6" REF="038359_0005_1011C9B3FB615EC8">but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n a &s;pecial manner <HI>again&s;t the lu&s;t of the fle&s;h,</HI> which in|cluded not only all manner of uncleanne&s;s, contrary to the order of nature, and all natural feelings and actions between <HI>male</HI> and <HI>female;</HI> but comprehended all natural union between natural relations, as being the product and fruits of the fle&s;h: and al&s;o to labor for the power of God to de&s;troy the very nature of the fle&s;h &s;o as to become an <HI>Eunuch</HI> for the kingdom of heaven's &s;ake. This I under&s;tood to be a total de&s;truction of the nature of generation, both as to the inclination of the &s;pirit and the natural faculties of, the body. Although this is not held &s;o now among the people; yet I am &s;ure it was &s;o communicated by the fir&s;t Mini&s;ters, and &s;o received and un|der&s;tood by all the people. It was held that the &s;eed &s;poken of by the Apo&s;tle John in his fir&s;t epi&s;tle, 3d chapter and 9th ver&s;e, was the natural &s;eed of copulation: it was held that the marriage in Cana of Gallilee, &s;poken of in the 2d chapter of John, was nothing el&s;e but the union of Chri&s;t and his di&s;ci|ples: it was al&s;o abundantly taught, that what was contained in the <HI>&s;criptures</HI> was of no u&s;e to us, as it re&s;pected our <HI>travail,</HI> being all in a back di&s;pen&s;ation; but that which was the pre|&s;ent gift of the Church mu&s;t be received as the infallible word of God.</P>
<P>All the&s;e things which I have mentioned, I had no more doubt of than I had of the being of an eternal God; but la|bored accordingly, in full faith and hope of obtaining a full and complete redemption from the nature and root of all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, which I believed to be the lu&s;t of the fle&s;h, as I have before ob&s;erved, my faith was &s;o firm that I do not remember ever at one time reading or &s;earching the &s;criptures, for my own con|firmation but only for the purpo&s;e of having wherewith to prove the truth of my profe&s;&s;ion, and to convince gain&s;ayets. At length, being found faithful and obedient, I received an or|der to labor, with others, and receive confe&s;&s;ions; which I went forth in, according as I was taught, and received the ap|probation and ble&s;&s;ing of the Church, and the work &s;eemed to flouri&s;h and pro&s;per, to my great encouragement, till &s;ome time in the &s;ummer of the year 1783, when an unhappy di&s;un|ion appeared in the Church, and as the matter could not be, or was not kept private, but did and has got abroad among the world, it may not be ami&s;s for me to give a &s;ketch of it; al|though it is far from my purpo&s;e to be a &s;landerer, or to &s;et <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> my&s;elf as a judge, to ju&s;tify or condemn; but to &s;tate &s;im|ple <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, as far as may be expedient, and leave the matter to him who is the judge of all.</P>
<P>It may be remembered that I before ob&s;erved, it was under|&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> and believed that not only the <HI>mother,</HI> but a number of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> had found complete redemption from all &s;in; among <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> were WILLIAM LEAS, her natural brother, and JAMES
<PB N="7" REF="038359_0006_1011862111889620">W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ITTAKE<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, an Engli&s;hman. It was under&s;tood by all, from our fir&s;t acquaintance with them, that William Leas &s;tood next to the mother, and James Whittaker next to him. How|ever in the &s;ummer of the year 1783, a &s;trife aro&s;e (or at lea&s;t it did not appear before to my knowledge) between them, which &s;hould be fir&s;t&mdash;the mother interfered to &s;ettle the con|trover&s;y, and the contention was very unhappy, and proved the means, I believe, of &s;eparating a number that appeared to be &s;trong believers; but it had no effect to &s;hake my faith at all; although I was an eye witne&s;s to that, which would be really &s;hocking to humanity. My faith was &s;o &s;trong in the mother, believing &s;he had the &s;ole government of all &s;ouls, both quick and dead, and was actuated wholly by the power of the invi&s;ible God, that if I had &s;een her &s;mite a man dead I don't know as I &s;hould have dared to give my&s;elf liberty to think it was wrong. But finally the di&s;pute terminated in the death of William Leas, in July, 1784. And by the death of the mother in September following, the mini&s;tration and govern|ment of the Church revolved on James Whittaker; this to be &s;ure was a very trying time to believers; it being &s;o con|trary from what was fir&s;t expected; but elder James &s;oon gath|ered the greate&s;t part of the people to a comfortable faith in his mini&s;tration, &s;ignifying it was nece&s;&s;ary for the mother to go away in order for a further increa&s;e of the go&s;pel&mdash;he prophecied abundantly of a great increa&s;e and &s;pread of the go&s;pel, which was &s;oon to take place.</P>
<P>He finally ordered the people to &s;ell their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and give to the poor, and to go forth and preach the go&s;pel, in obedience to the gift: &s;ome actually &s;old their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, others were preparing to do it; for my part I had nothing to &s;ell, but went to the Church to know what the gift was for me, &amp; &s;poke to Elder James, his words to me were the&s;e, <HI>"Go forth and circumci&s;e as many as you can."</HI> In obedience to his order, I went forth and took a journey down into Con|necticut, where for my te&s;timony I was taken <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p, and put into <HI>New-London</HI> Goal, where I was kept a pri&s;oner four months. However the order that was given for the people to &s;ell their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions was taken off&mdash;they were told the time had not come, but that it was a gift to try their faith&mdash;&s;o that they which had &s;old, had to buy again, and &s;o the matter re&s;ted.</P>
<P>As for me, after I got relea&s;ed from pri&s;on, and by the help of &s;ome of my friends, &s;ettled all my expences; I r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|turned again to Elder James where I had the privilege of go|ing &s;everal journies with him, and as I had a peculiar faculty in &s;inging, my gift was chiefly to labor in Songs. But the la&s;t journey I went with him, which was in the year 1787, the latter part of the winter&mdash;on returning home he was taken &s;ick &s;o that he could g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t no farther than Enfield, (in Con|necticut,)
<PB N="8" REF="038359_0007_1011C9B8ECFB9060">where he remained till July following, and dep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> this life.</P>
<P>This was a very trying &s;cene with me, as well as many oth|ers, for I think I can truly &s;ay I loved him as I did my own life. Notwith&s;tanding, I was not at all &s;haken in my faith<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> but believed that God would carry on his own work&mdash;and as there was &s;everal men who &s;eemed to be ble&s;&s;ed with great abilities, which had labored in the mini&s;try with Elder James, we were not left without hope; but that the go&s;pel would yet increa&s;e according to what had been &s;poken. At this time there was a very &s;trong labor among three men, who were the principal mini&s;ters that were left, to know which of them &s;hould have the fir&s;t gift. At length the lot &s;ell upon Elder JOSEPH MEACHEM, a man greatly beloved and re&s;pected by all the people. His labor &s;eemed to be to gather the &s;en&s;ation of the people to a farther increa&s;e, &s;ignifying the departure of Elder James was nece&s;&s;ary for the further increa&s;e of the go&s;|pel, and that it was impo&s;&s;ible to take place while he continu|ed in the body. The manner of the increa&s;e here &s;poken of, I &s;hall ende<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vor to de&s;cribe in as few words as I can, &s;o as to comprehend the &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>It was &s;ignified that the believers as a body were all in fle&s;hly relation, and that the time had come for a number to be gathered out of that relation into church relation, to be pur|ged and purified from the fle&s;h, and be prepared to mini&s;ter the go&s;pel to others. The fir&s;t gathering took place at New-Lebanon in 1788, where there was a great number gathered, both <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ale and female; numbers of which were &s;elected from all the different parts, among believers; &s;ome on account of their pe|culiar ingenuity and faculties in temporal things, to be helps in the temporal order of the Church; others (it was &s;ignified) were gathered for the more &s;pecial purpo&s;e of being helps to other &s;ouls, in &s;priitual things; others were gathered merely, for the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r own protection and &s;alvation; and others on account of their temporal property. The&s;e were all under a daily mini&s;tration, for Elder Jo&s;eph and &s;ome others, who were a&s;|&s;i&s;tants to him in the mini&s;try; but the labors and exerci&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> both of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and &s;pirit, which this people were exerci&s;ed in under the daily mini&s;tration, is not ea&s;ily conceived by any one who was not a witne&s;s of what I &s;hall not undertake to be particular: but believe it will be &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that their chief labor was to de&s;troy the whole order of nature, expect|ing to obtain the power of God, &s;o as to wholly actuate and move the human frame, independent of any natural &s;trength. How much propriety there was in the undertaking, time has &s;ufficiently &s;hewn; upon which I &s;hall ob&s;erve hereafter.</P>
<P>However to proceed in relation to the increa&s;e of the peo|ple, which were g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">red, as has been ob&s;erved, were called
<PB N="9" REF="038359_0008_1011C9B583917B90">the Church or Church relation, the re&s;t were all called fle&s;hly relation; but the fire or furnace in Zion, as it was called, was not wholly confined in the Church. Mini&s;ters were &s;ent from the Church to other parts to kindle the &s;ame fire, and in a par|ticular manner to Hancock, the then place of my re&s;idence, where the flame burnt &s;o exceedingly that it &s;eemed as though nothing would remain but ju&s;t faith; but that &s;eemed to be as un&s;haken as ever. At length, after two or three years of un|remitting labors and tribulation, the time came for the people, in Hancock, to be gathered into Church relation; Elder CALVIN HARLOW, a very de&s;irable young man, and one who had the love and e&s;teem of all the peopie, was appointed as a Bi&s;hop, for to gather the Church in Hancock, which took place in the fir&s;t part of the year 1791. This &s;eemed to be a time of comfort and &s;atisfaction, hoping we &s;hould now have a privilege to <HI>travail</HI> out of the fle&s;h, for we had under&s;tood that they which had a privilege in Church relation, could tra|vail farther out of the fle&s;h in one week than they which were in fle&s;hly relation could in a year; and as it was the mo&s;t e&s;|&s;ential principle of our faith, to find redemption from the fle&s;h, our hopes of &s;alvation now inerea&s;ed.</P>
<P>But to proceed farther re&s;pecting the increa&s;e about or be|fore this time, there was a further gift in the Church, at Leb|anon, which was called and is &s;till, the Mother Church; the gift was this, they were taught that they had got to find their order of relation to God, in the li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of Church order; that is they had got to find who their Parents were, and who their Mini&s;ters were, and who their Elders were, and al&s;o, their order of relation one to another, as brethren and fi&s;ters; that is, to know who was 1&s;t, 2d, 3d, &amp;c.&mdash;as to their parents it was doubtle&s;s without any difficulty they acknowledged Elder Jo&s;eph to be their father in the Go&s;pel; but as to a mother, it was &s;uch a new thing and &s;o unexpected that there was &s;ome|thing of a labor before the matter was fini&s;hed: as to the re&s;t, as it does not re&s;pect my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, I &s;hall omit &s;aying any thing about it: but as the &s;ame line of order was prcaced to us in Hancock, and the per&s;ons appointed and &s;et before us, we had no difficulty in acknowledging them to be our Parents and received what they &s;poke to us as the oracle of God. Some time after we were called upon to labor, to know who our Elders were and find our relation to them&mdash;my&s;elf and one more male and two females were appointed, and called upon to labor for the lot of Elder&s;hip. We labored accor|dingly, believing what we were taught to be the infallible word of God.</P>
<P>Now perhaps it may be enquired what was the work or bu&s;ine&s;s of the&s;e Elders, what was the purpo&s;e of their gift. It was this, they were to &s;tand between their parents and the re&s;t of the family with whom they lived&mdash;they were to receive
<PB N="10" REF="038359_0009_1011C9BA74E23928">the word and coun&s;el of God from their parents, and commu|nicate the &s;ame to the re&s;t of the family&mdash;the family wera to look to the Elders, and to them only, for every gift of God they received; and likewi&s;e, the Elders to the parents: how|ever it frequently happened that the parents &s;poke to individ|uals, and &s;ome times to all, as occa&s;ion required. Now after we had labored &s;ome time, according to our fir&s;t appointment, being called Elder brethren and Elder &s;i&s;ters, not knowing which was fir&s;t or which was la&s;t; we were all told by our parents that there was but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne Elder brother and one Elder &s;i&s;ter; there was one which was the olde&s;t, and but one, and the family were all required to labor and manife&s;t their faith who, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> one was, They accordingly labored, and all &s;igni|fied their faith to be in me as their Elder brother, and that one who was a partner with me to be their Elder &s;i&s;ter This be|ing ratified and confirmed by our parents as the gift of God, they all looked to me as their Elder, by which and through which they were to receive every gift of God that came to them. This brought me to a very &s;olemn and weighty con|cern, to di&s;charge my duty in relation to my brethren and &s;if|ters, &s;o that they might receive comfort and con&s;olation, and I be acce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ted of God: but as I had full faith in my parents, and had liberty to a&s;k their coun&s;el upon every needful occa|&s;ion, we &s;eemed to enjoy in &s;ome mea&s;ure, a comfortable <HI>travail,</HI> hoping yet to &s;ee the increa&s;e of the go&s;pel as had been prophecied. At length, Elder Calvin, whom we e&s;teemed as our father in the go&s;pe&s;, was taken very &s;ick, &s;o that he was not expected to continue in the body; his &s;ickne&s;s, however, (which rendered him unable, a great part of the time, to give much coun&s;el or in&s;truction in relation to the Church) did not immediately take him away; but he continued for more than a year, and departed this life the 21&s;t of December, 1795.</P>
<P>This was a time of much affliction and &s;orrow; but yet my faith was un&s;haken, and being encouraged by her whom we called and e&s;teemed to be our mother, that there would be an increa&s;e of the go&s;pel in a &s;hort time, therefore we labored to take courage and hope in God. About this time I under&s;tood it was believed in the Church, at Lebanon, that the time was ju&s;t at hand for the go&s;pel to be opened to the world, and about this time the gift of laboring for mortification came a|bout to an end; it was found that we lo&s;t our natural &s;trength fa&s;te than we obtained the power of God to replace it, &s;o that by this means a great many had gone into eternity, and a great many were very weak: by this time Elder Jo&s;eph, the fir&s;t Bi&s;hop, who was believed in the Church to be the de&s;cendent of David that was to de&s;troy Gog and Magog, became very much reduced and impaired in his health, though he &s;eemed to labor very &s;trong for a further opening of the go&s;pel among

<P>Soon after Elder Jo&s;eph's decea&s;e, &s;he that was called our mother, in Hancock, was taken &s;ick, and continued a few weeks, and departed this life, which was on the 19th of Sep|tember, 1796 Here began a &s;cene of tribulation which ex|ceeded all my former experience; although before th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> things &s;ometimes appeared very dark and unaccountable, having our expectations &s;o cut off from time to time; but while I had a privilege to be told what to do by them that I believed had the knowledge of God, it was ea&s;y for me to be obedient without giving my&s;elf much trouble about the propriety or impro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">+ty of matters: but now being left to labor my&s;elf and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of the people, who&s;e eyes were upon me as their leader <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> filled with great concern and labor to know the will of G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> relation to my&s;elf and the re&s;t of my brethren and &s;i&s;ters. However, having been taught by our parents the order of our relation to God, and of &s;ome things that would be the gift after their decea&s;e, which was not only &s;poke to me, but al&s;o to num|bers of the re&s;t. I was determined to labor according to the teaching we had received, hoping that God would open the way for our protection, and for the farther increa&s;e of the go&s;pel. About this time or not long after &s;ome things took place in relation to us, by the coun&s;el or order of the Church at Lebanon, which was a matter of &s;ome trial, not to me only, but to the whole of the Church, as it appeared contradictory to what had been taught by our parents; but af|ter giving my&s;elf an opportunity of being informed, it &s;eemed to be made to appear that the matter was not incon&s;i&s;tent or contradictory to any thing which we had before received, but altogether neceffary for our increa&s;e.</P>
<P>About this time there &s;eemed to be a gift in the Church, at Lebanon, that the time had come for the go&s;pel to be opened to the world&mdash;mini&s;ters were appointed and &s;ent forth under the direction of Henry Clough, or Elder Henry, as he was called; the gift was for them to go forth and preach the go&s;|pel to the world, and have them confe&s;s their &s;ins, &amp;c. and
<PB N="12" REF="038359_0011_1011C9C3A2F69F60">remain where they were and not come to the Church. They went forth accordingly, time and again, and a great &s;ound there &s;eemed to be, of abundance, of rain, as it were, which &s;eemed to be a matter of great rejoicing: however, as there was not much brought to pa&s;s, it was believed that they had not got the right gift, but that it was nece&s;&s;ary to have another gift, which was this, they were to go forth and preach the go&s;|pel and invite all to come to the Church: but this did not &s;eem to have the de&s;ired effect. Finally, it was thought that the lack was in the mini&s;ters; they were &s;u&s;pended and oth|ers &s;ent forth; but all to little or no purpo&s;e In the mean time Elder Henry, who was admired for his wi&s;dom and a|bilities, and depended on as one whom God had rai&s;ed up for the defence and increa&s;e of the go&s;pel, was taken &s;ick and in a &s;hort time left this world, which I think was about the fir&s;t of March, 1798. The&s;e things gave me much exerci&s;e of mind, it &s;eemed as though God would de&s;troy the hope of man &s;ure enough: yet I dared not give way to unbelie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> or to be di&s;couraged; but labored to put as favorable con&s;truction on every thing as I was able; but I was ready to &s;ay &s;ometimes to my&s;elf, "Merciful God, what is the matter, is all things right;" but would check my&s;elf, and &s;hut it out, and labor to take courage: however, there were other things that increa&s;ed my tribulation&mdash;one of which was this, there was &s;ome who were appointed by the mother Church, as mini&s;ters to re&s;ide <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> meeting-hou&s;e, in Hancock, and labor in relation to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> in that order, &amp; to receive coun&s;el from the Church at Lebanon, &amp; mini&s;ter the &s;ame to the people in their own order &mdash;with the&s;e I had labored to &s;upport union and peace, accor|ding to the be&s;t of my knowledge, which &s;ucceeded in a good degree. But, at length, in the increa&s;e, as it was called, there &s;eemed to be that faith required of me, in relation to them, that I was not able to obtain, without further under&s;tanding, it appeared to me, as well as to a number of others that in order to believe and receive, what they told me I mu&s;t reject, what we had been taught by our parents, and count them as decei|vers and impo&s;ters. This brought me under a great trial, and as I was not able to open my mind to my &s;atisfaction, &s;o as to find any help, I thought I would try one way more, and with the advice of &s;ome of my brethren, I &s;et down and wrote a pret|ty lengthy letter, wherein I &s;tated my grievances and trials in as humble and Godly manner as I was able, de&s;iring to have &s;ome help in my mind if there was any for me in the Church.

<P>Before this time we had found by certain experience to a demon&s;tration, that one e&s;&s;ential principle of our faith was no le&s;s that a gro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s ab&s;urdity, which I &s;hall endeavor to &s;hew&mdash; the principle of our faith was this, we heard and believed that by confe&s;&s;ing and for&s;aking our &s;ins, we &s;hould be able by the power of God to labor completely out of the nature of the fle&s;h, that is to &s;ay, to wholly de&s;troy that nature and faculty which is created in men and women for the purpo&s;e of propa|gating their &s;pecie. This &s;eemed to be the greate&s;t and mo&s;t arduous work there was to be done; but receiving &s;uch great encouragement, under &s;tanding and believing that there was a number which had already attained to it, we undertook the work cheerfully, and labored all manner of ways that we could conceive would have any tendency to mortify the fle&s;h; but &s;till the fle&s;h lived, though &s;ome were &s;o violent in their la|bors, and brought their bodies under &s;o much weakne&s;s that there was not much power of erection in the parts of genera|tion; but the &s;olids being &s;o relaxed and the retentive faculty &s;o weakened, that they were more &s;ubject to involuntary evacu|ations than they were before. However as there was abun|dance
<PB N="15" REF="038359_0014_1011C9D0A448DD38">of means u&s;ed to encourage us in the work, we per&s;eve|red with unremitting labors till the Church was gathered i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Lebanon.

<P>At length, after a while the gift &s;eemed to abate about labor|ing for mortification, till finally it came quite to an end.

<P>All the&s;e things I had ob&s;erved and under&s;tood, and as I had the care of a con&s;iderable number that frequently opened their feelings and trials to me, and their unbelief in finding a total end to the fle&s;h in this world; I labored into the matter thor|oughly, till I was fully &s;atisfied for my&s;elf: I was informed, and that from good authority, that the fir&s;t mother, whom we believed to be equal with the Angels, was &s;ubject to the &s;ame natural infirmities which were incident to other women, which, if true, as I had &s;ome under&s;tanding in the theory of the hu|man machine, I was per&s;uaded &s;he was not delivered from the nature of generation, it being nece&s;&s;ary for that purpo&s;e, and that only. Having under&s;tood all the&s;e things, and much more al&s;o, which I could mention were it nece&s;&s;ary; I was ful|ly per&s;uaded that it was as po&s;&s;ible to &s;top the blood and juices from flowing into an arm or a leg, or to dry up the marrow in the bones, as to accompli&s;h what we had undertaken. Being fully &s;atisfied I did not &s;cruple to &s;peak my faith among my
<PB N="16" REF="038359_0015_1011C9D263D4C678">brethren; not for their di&s;couragement but for their encouarge|ment, that they might not be ca&s;t down and di&s;couraged if they felt the fle&s;h ever &s;o &s;trong; knowing we had got it to fight to the end of our days: however I was exceedingly tried, as well as the re&s;t, to find we had been &s;o deceived, not knowing but what we might be deceived in a great many other things as well as that; but being de&s;irous to know how the matter was held by them who were before us. I took an op|portunity with the mini&s;ter whom I looked to for coun&s;el, and opened &s;ome of the brethren's feelings to him in relation to the matter. He at fir&s;t &s;eemed to intimate as though there was an evil &s;pirit to work with them; but when I come to tell him frankly what my faith was in relation to the matter he gave the matter up, and joined with me, telling a number of cir|cum&s;tances to confirm it. But to return to the fir&s;t principles of our faith, viz. The &s;econd appearance of Chri&s;t in that woman which we called the mother. I have before ob&s;erved, that &s;he was &s;aid to be the woman &s;poken of in the 12th chap. of Rev. it was held that the man child &s;he brought forth was James Whittaker, and her going into the wilderne&s;s was her coming into America. Now when I came to read the &s;crip|tures for my&s;elf, and remembered what I was taught and what I believed, I was a&s;toni&s;hed with my&s;elf that ever I imbibed &s;uch ab&s;urd ideas; but the rea&s;on was, I never &s;earched the &s;criptures to &s;ee if the&s;e things were &s;o, but believed and re|ceived every thing I heard, without giving my&s;elf liberty to doubt the truth of it; but when I came to look and read for my&s;elf, the matter looks &s;o plain and obvious that it &s;eems as though I &s;hould be guilty of impertinence to make any com|ment upon it, but &s;hall leave every one to read and judge for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Now I &s;hall leave this matter and ob&s;erve &s;ome things which took place in the Church which gave me much affliction.</P>
<P>We had &s;ome years before entered into covenant to main|tain and &s;upport a joint intere&s;t one with another, and agreed not to bring one another into debt for any &s;ervices or intere&s;t we &s;hould be&s;tow to the joint intere&s;t of the Church. This was entered into in writtng, with our names &s;ub&s;cribed to it: but the meaning or intention of this thing as we under&s;tood it, was this, there had been a number that had left the people and come with great demands for wages, &amp;c.&mdash;Some of which ap|peared to be very unju&s;t, and brought di&s;tre&s;s upon the Church. This covenant therefore was intended to cut them off from making any demand, &s;o that the Church might be able to do that which was ju&s;t and equal in relation to them, without being brought into di&s;tre&s;s and &s;o the matter was conducted for a number of years. When any one went away, the Deacons and Over&s;eers came to a &s;ettlement with them&mdash;paid them a
<PB N="17" REF="038359_0016_1011C9D5DA184088">certain &s;um and took a final di&s;charge: whether they did ju&s;|tice or not. I do not pretend to &s;ay; but I had heard it inti|mated &s;ome time pa&s;t, that the time would come when tho&s;e who went away from the Church would not be allowed any thing at all: however, I did not believe that ever I &s;hould &s;ee that time come; it looked to me like &s;uch barefaced inju&s;tice, that I could not think it would ever be pre&s;umed upon. How|ever it was not a great while before the gift come &s;ure enough, and as it got among the Deacons before I had knowledge of it, it was divulged among&s;t the family, which made no &s;mall &s;tir among them; and as they opened their trials to me in the matter, I labored to pacify them, telling them I did not be|lieve it: however, I was determined to know the truth of it, and as I had an opportunity with the Mini&s;ter, I opened what trials there was among the brethren, and de&s;ired to know the truth of the matter. He was very free and open to di&s;clo&s;e the whole matter, and opened his faith freely&mdash;he &s;aid he be|lieved that tho&s;e who went away and left the Church has no more right to receive any temporal property out of the Church as a compen&s;ation for any labor or any intere&s;t they had bro't in, no more than Judas had a right to an inheritance with the Apo&s;tles after he had betrayed CHRIST. It was alledged that the intere&s;t or &s;ervice that was given, was given to God, and to take away that which was given to God would be com|mitting <HI>&s;acrilege.</HI> This indeed was pretty &s;trong meat for me, however, I thought I would not &s;ay any thing to bring my&s;elf into trouble: but being a&s;ked the que&s;tion what my faith was in relation to the matter, I dared not be otherwi&s;e than an hon|e&s;t man, &s;o I opened my faith hone&s;tly. I told him I believed that if any one who had lived with us, and labored faithfully, and &s;pent their &s;trength with us for a number of years, and finally, for &s;ome cau&s;e or other they cho&s;e to go away and leave us, it was a righteous thing for us to give them &s;ome|thing as a compen&s;ation for their labour I told him if one who lived there with us that had a piece of land which he had given in to the joint intere&s;t, and afterwards &s;aw fit to take him&s;elf away, I could not in con&s;cience feel any heart to im|prove that land, unle&s;s it was purcha&s;ed of him, and he re|ceived the value of it. As to its being &s;acrilege I could not conceive the matter to be &s;o that what was given for Sacred U&s;e and con&s;ecrated to God for that purpo&s;e, to take it away might be called &s;acrelege: But this &s;eemed to me to be a dif|ficult thing: When we came together we brought what we had, and put it into the common &s;tock, for the general benefit of all, not for others any more than for our&s;elves, to be u&s;ed equally, according to our daily needs, &s;uch as eating, drinking, &amp;c. &s;o that I could not &s;ee the propriety of &s;aying it was all given up for Sacred u&s;e any more than our daily eating and
<PB N="18" REF="038359_0017_1011C9D761A55F70">drinking, or any others temporal duty is &s;acred. It was &s;igni|fied to me that the wicked did not de&s;erve any thing but judg|ment, which included all that were not of that profe&s;&s;ion. It was told me they who went away from the Church to the world had what they went after; they had the fle&s;h and that was enough for them.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to what was &s;aid of the wicked's not de&s;erving any thing, I &s;aid, if a wicked man does me a day's work, it is as ju&s;t and right for me to pay him, as though he had been a righteous man: al&s;o, I told them I did not know but the time might come when the people of God would have power to ex|ecute judgment, but I did not believe that the time had come yet, therefore, I queried thus; here is one of the brethren (mentioning his name) who has been here the&s;e 8 or 9 years, and has laboured faithfully&mdash;he has been a very &s;trong labo|rious young man and has done a great deal of good&mdash;by and by he gets di&s;couraged, lo&s;es his faith, or for &s;ome other cau&s;e, he choo&s;es to go away and leaves us. Well, we &s;ay, he har gone to the unclean and left the only means of his &s;alvation and will have to &s;uffer the judgment of God. Now, is not that enough for him to bear&mdash;do not we ought to feel &s;orry for him, and pity him, or &s;hall we try to make him as wretched and mi&s;erable as we po&s;&s;ibly can in this world, by depriving him of all the fruit of his labor which is nece&s;&s;ary for his &s;ub|&s;i&s;tance in this world? can this be right, or can any one who has a chri&s;tian &s;pirit have a heart to do it?</P>
<P>To repeat all the conver&s;ation we had upon this &s;ubject would be very lengthy and needle&s;s; but it co&s;t me a great deal of af|fliction before I got through with it.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only further ob&s;erve, that we compromi&s;ed the mat|ter as well as we could. I admitted they that went away had no right to make any demand according to the covenant, and the matter &s;eemed to be dropped as to its being &s;in to give them any thing, and &s;o we labored for union again. However, numbers not long after went away and left the Church, I &s;up|po&s;e, chiefly on that account; but they were &s;ettled with, and &s;omething given to them for peace &s;ake, &s;o as to get a final di&s;charge from them, that would &s;ecure the Church from any controver&s;y in the law. This was a re&s;erve that was made that it might be right to &s;acrifice &s;omething, for peace &s;ake, rather than to enter into a controver&s;y that might bring the Church into trouble.</P>
<P>Not far from this time (as I was continually exerci&s;ed in tribulation which I was unable to keep undi&s;covered, although the cau&s;e I labored to keep to my&s;elf; but doubtle&s;s it was ob&s;erved that I did not preach up faith &s;o &s;trong as I had done in times pa&s;t, but labored to maintain union and reconciliation to the pre&s;ent gift and order that was for us,) being in company
<PB N="19" REF="038359_0018_1011C9DD5CF31648">with the Mini&s;ters one evening, I was que&s;tioned re&s;pecting my faith. I was a&s;ked whether I had a living witne&s;s in me, <HI>that this was the &s;econd coming of</HI> CHRIST? I &s;aid nay. I have not. My an&s;wer &s;eemed to be very &s;urpri&s;ing and unexpected: however, they undertook to labor with me&mdash;I &s;hewed my rea|&s;ons in part; but the more they labored with me, the le&s;s &s;aith I &s;ell, till I did not &s;ee but I &s;hould loo&s;e all I had got. The labor continued a day or two, till my tribulation was unutterable. I did not &s;ee but what I mu&s;t give up my place as an Elder, for I always had a mortal aver&s;ion to hypocrites, and I did not &s;ee but what I had got to be one my&s;elf in &s;ome degree, although I was con&s;cious to my&s;elf that I had never done any intended wrong, not wilfully acted any thing that I knew was &s;in, &s;ince the fir&s;t of my profe&s;&s;ion; but as I had not faith, without doubt, I was not able to preach faith to oth|ers; however, viewing the con&s;equences that would naturally follow, I de&s;ired to labour further, and accordingly went to the Mini&s;ters and humbled my&s;elf, and begged their patience with me till I had labored for a further increa&s;e of faith. They &s;eemed to be thankful for my re&s;olution and labored to en|courage me in it.</P>
<P>But to return again to the labor I was in, to wit, in &s;earching the &s;criptures to a&s;certain whether the day and time had come, according to the te&s;timony, of the &s;econd appearing of Chri&s;t. I have already &s;hewn that in &s;ome of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential points of our faith we were gro&s;sly deceived, and there were many other things which I found to my &s;atisfaction, were equally ab|&s;urd. One thing I heard a&s;&s;erted not long &s;ince (by one who profe&s;&s;ed to be my teacher) in the mo&s;t po&s;itive terms that the Church was now in the new Jeru&s;alem &s;tate. This appeared to me to be a deception, for in that &s;tate it is plainly &s;aid that God will wipe away all tears from their eyes, and there &s;hall be no more death, neither &s;orrow nor crying, neither &s;hall there be any more pain, for the former things are pa&s;&s;ed away. The pre&s;ent &s;tate of the Church &s;eemed to me to be quite the rever&s;e from this, for there is both &s;orrow, pain and death, and that to a greater degree than what there is among many other people; but this is called &s;uffering with Chri&s;t: however it appears to me without all doubt that the &s;ole cau&s;e for the greate&s;t part of the &s;ufferings and deaths that have been among this people is intemperance. What propriety there is in &s;ay|ing that the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t has come in his glory with all the holy Angels with him, to reign as king upon Earth, and yet his Church be in a &s;tate of &s;ufferings I do not pretend to &s;ay, but &s;hall leave it for every one to judge for them&s;elves: but as I &s;hall not have time to be particular in &s;hewing my ideas on every pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture which I have quoted, and have peru&s;ed to my &s;atisfaction. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve upon a
<PB N="20" REF="038359_0019_1011C9E190844198">few things which were &s;pokon by the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which I believe will be acknowledged to be the mo&s;t &s;ure word of prophecy. In the 24th chapter of Matthew Chri&s;t gives a very particular account of what &s;hould take place before his coming, and the manner of his coming; and in the 25th chap|ter he tells what &s;hould be after his coming&mdash;he &s;ignifies that before his coming there would be a great many &s;ounds and voices about religion; fal&s;e prophets and fal&s;e Chri&s;ts &s;hould ari&s;e and &s;hew great &s;igns and wonders &amp;c. Ob&s;erve this was to be before his coming, not afterwards, "for (he &s;ays) as the light'ning cometh out of the Ea&s;t and &s;hineth even unto the We&s;t, &s;o &s;hall the coming of the &s;on of man be;" there will be &s;uch light and evidence manife&s;ted as will put the matter be|yond all controver&s;y, both with the ju&s;t and unju&s;t, for he &s;ays, "all the tribes of the Earth &s;hall &s;ee him, &amp; &s;hall mourn at hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> appearing. "Now it is held by &s;ome that the light'ning here &s;pok|en of does not mean the <HI>electrical</HI> fire that come<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> out of the <HI>clouds,</HI> but the &s;un that ri&s;eth in the Ea&s;t, &amp; progre&s;&s;ively increa&s;|es till it enlightens the whole Earth. Admitting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> be the ca&s;e, it is no le&s;s evident that the &s;econd coming of Chri&s;t will be with &s;uch inconte&s;tible evidence, that all men will have to &s;ubmit to his government; for as the &s;un ri&s;es, the day appears, the darkne&s;s pa&s;&s;es away, and every object that &s;carcely di&s;cern|able in the night now appears clearly to be what it is; and as it is impo&s;&s;ible for the &s;un to ri&s;e and not bring the day along with it, &s;o it appears to be impo&s;&s;ible, according to what is written, for the &s;un of righteou&s;ne&s;s to ari&s;e, and be ari&s;ing more than f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ty years, and almo&s;t all the inhabitants of the Earth be entirely ignorant of it: but perhaps it may be &s;aid it is po&s;&s;ible for men to &s;leep in the day, when the &s;un does &s;hine, and not know whether it be day or night; but Chri&s;t &s;ays, he &s;hall &s;end his Angels with a great &s;ound of a trumpet. This no doubt, will awaken every creature, for "all the tribes of the Earth &s;hall mourn, and they &s;hall &s;ee the &s;on of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory." Perhaps it is needle&s;s for me to &s;ay that there never was more &s;ects and denominations of religion&mdash;and lo here! and lo there! than there is at this pre&s;ent time. This is a &s;ign that the day of Chri&s;t is at hand; but not that it has already come, and been come the&s;e fifty years.</P>
<P>Now after Chri&s;t had &s;poken a con&s;iderable time in relation to his coming, and the manner of it, he tells us how it &s;hould be after he had come; beginning at Matthew, 25th chapter and 31&s;t ver&s;e, where he &s;ays, "when the &s;on of man &s;hall come in his glory, and all the holy Angels with him, then &s;hall he &s;et upon the throne of his glory, and before him &s;hall be gathered all nations, and he &s;hall &s;eparate them one from another, as a &s;hhepherd divideth his &s;heep from the goats, and he &s;hall &s;et
<PB N="21" REF="038359_0020_1011C9E7843554E0">&s;heep on the right, but the goats on the left; then, &s;hall the king &s;ay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o them on his right hand, come ye ble&s;&s;ed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the founda|tion of the world, for I was an hungred and ye gave me meat, &amp;c."</P>
<P>This paragraph, or pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture, came into my mind &s;ome days before I left the people in Hancock. I was under exceeding tribulation in my mind with re&s;pect to the&s;e things that I had been laboring in. I walked out into the garden to amu&s;e my mind &s;ome, with the natural creation; while I was walking in the garden it &s;eemed to break forth into my mind, as though it was &s;ent by the invi&s;ible power of him that &s;poke it fir&s;t; the rea&s;on that was a&s;&s;igned for pronouncing the ble&s;&s;ing was the matter that operated more e&s;&s;entially in my mind, "for I was a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> hungred and ye gave me meat:" it was not becau&s;e they were Shakers, or Quakers, or any one par|ticular &s;ect or denomination; it was not becau&s;e they gave alms and &s;ounded a trumpet &s;o as to have the prai&s;e of men; it was not becau&s;e they attended to a great many orders and ceremo|nies, for fear of puni&s;hment, expecting thereby to make them|&s;elves a righteou&s;ne&s;s. Nay, it was not all this. But what was it? It was becau&s;e they had received the &s;pirit of the Lord Je&s;us, which made them love to to good to their fellow crea|tures; it was becau&s;e they loved righteou&s;ne&s;s, for righteou&s;|ne&s;s &s;ake; it was becau&s;e they loved tho&s;e that hated them, and ble&s;&s;ed tho&s;e that cur&s;ed them; and when they had done all, they could feel them&s;elves unprofitable &s;ervants, as it &s;eems was the tenor of their language. They were ready to cry out, Lord where did we do &s;uch and &s;uch things? They felt as if they had done nothing that was &s;ufficient to make them worthy of any favor; but what they had done they did out of love to God, and therefore had made no account of it.</P>
<P>The&s;e meditations and contemplations &s;eemed to carry me quite beyond the limits of my order. I forgot all my trouble, and almo&s;t forgot I was a Shaker; however, recollecting where and what I was, my trouble &s;oon come on again; and as there was &s;ome things about that time that come forth as order, which I had not much faith in, &s;o that I could not &s;peak it to the re&s;t as a matter of my own faith, which I was required to do, without wronging my con&s;cience. I came to a re&s;olution to relign my office, and not be a hypocrite any longer, let the event be as it would, though I was not determined to come away till I was further &s;atisfied: I accordingly carried my my re&s;olution into effect and gave up my place as the Elder Brother, June 30th, and de&s;ired no one to look to me for any help or any coun&s;el as they had done, but to labor for my|&s;elf only, and be e&s;teemed as one of the lea&s;t of all. This I &s;poke to the family, and told them I felt my&s;elf quite come to
<PB N="22" REF="038359_0021_1011C9EB22FCA658">an end. and unable to be any further help to them; but did not tell the cau&s;e, in particular, for I was not allowed by any means to open my weakne&s;s or unbelief to the reft, re&s;pecting the foundation of our profe&s;&s;ion. But the circum&s;tance of my religning my place &s;eemed to be very &s;hocking, and cau&s;ed great agitations and anxiety of mind throughout the Church. My tribulation al&s;o was not at all le&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ned; viewing things as they had been in relation to me, and comparing them with my pre&s;ent &s;tate; it &s;eemed as though it was more than I &s;hould be able to endure, and continue in the body: but as I had but one life to lo&s;e, and one &s;oul to &s;ave, I was determined once for all, to be an hone&s;t man, and abide the event.</P>
<P>However, as there was one appointed to &s;upply the place which I had left, there was immediately great labor and pains taken to &s;eperate the feelings of the Church from me, both by the Mini&s;ters and Elders; and as this could not ea&s;ily be done without finding &s;omething again&s;t me, whereby it might be made to appear that I had been wicked, and gone contrary to the order of the Church. There was no pains &s;pared in labor|ing and &s;earching to find &s;ome iniquity, both by examining me and many others, till finally it was thought they had found &s;ome thing worthy of admonition. I was labored with and &s;e|verely admoni&s;hed, even for that which they them&s;elves would have ju&s;tified. A few months before I was told I had got to come to &s;uch and &s;uch things or go to the world, &amp;c. I received the communication without making much reply, and told them I &s;hould con&s;ider of it I but notwith&s;tanding, I had felt many times as though I could go away and leave them with as much peace of con&s;cience as ever I lay down to &s;leep as to any faith I had that bound me there; yet, when I come to bring the matter near and realize it, to for&s;ake the people which I &s;o loved, and had &s;o long maintained &s;uch a near re|lation and intimate union with, and with whom I had a com|fortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, with re&s;pect to temporal things, and &s;eek me a place among &s;trangers, it &s;eemed as though I had rather give up my life and go into eternity; for my natural relations were as much &s;trangers to me at the re&s;t of mankind, for from the fir&s;t of my faith, there was no one to my knowledge that labored more effectually to reject and &s;hut out their natural relations than my&s;elf: and having been very bold and pre|&s;umptuous to te&s;tily many things to them, which I had good rea&s;on to believe were dictated by the &s;pirit of <HI>error,</HI> and that which I &s;hould have to acknowledge was fal&s;e and ab&s;urd; and al&s;o in treating them with &s;uch unnatural contempt. that I felt as though I &s;hould never have confidence to a&s;k of them any favor.</P>
<P>In con&s;ideration of the&s;e things and feeling my heart and affections &s;o bound up in the family whore I lived, that I
<PB N="23" REF="038359_0022_1011C9EEF3E412A8">cho&s;e to &s;ubmit to any thing that was required of me, as far as I was able and not &s;in again&s;t my own con&s;cience, not &s;eeing any thing but what I mu&s;t &s;oon leave this world, for my appe|tite to food was all gone, &s;o that I was able to take very out lit|tle for my nouri&s;hment; and there was &s;uch a pain in my heart, almo&s;t continually, that it &s;eemed &s;ome times as though it would bur&s;t a&s;under; and all the remedy I could find was weeping and crying to God&mdash;and this was &s;o trouble&s;ome to the Mini&s;ters and Elders (it having &s;uch an effect upon tho&s;e that had tender feelings) that I was di&s;allowed weeping before the family, or indeed, any where el&s;e; however I was not a|ble to refrrin all the time; but when my heart was in &s;uch pain that I could endure it no longer. I would take my&s;elf a|lone and weep and pray to God till I was in &s;ome mea&s;ure re|fre&s;hed; but my tribulation &s;till continued as con&s;tant as my breath, though the family was exceeding kind and tender to me, and were willing to help me to every thing I needed as to temporal &s;upport, and would often try to comfort me in my &s;pirit, but it was all in vain&mdash;al&s;o the Mini&s;ters and Elders frequently labored with me, to help my faith; but that was e|qually in vain; for the more they labored with me, the more I was &s;atisfied we were all upon a wrong foundation, and &s;hould at la&s;t be found fal&s;e witne&s;&s;es before God. It appear|ed evident to me that my feelings to the people and family where I lived was partial, and that which was acquired by a long habit of intimacy, more than by the true love of God, which is univer&s;al to all that believe in Chri&s;t. Viewing things to be &s;o I was unwilling to &s;tay there and die, for death appeared to me not far di&s;tant, as my body was reduced almo&s;t to a &s;keliton, and my natural &s;trength almo&s;t exhau&s;ted; there|fore I believed it was my duty to change my condition by coming away and leaving them, and renouncing that which I believed was error: but the cro&s;s I had to take up for that purpo&s;e I believe was &s;even fold greater than it was to for&s;ake my father's hou&s;e and join that people at fir&s;t&mdash;however I gathered up as much re&s;olution as I could, and accompli&s;hed my purpo&s;e the 24th of July, 1799, by bidding them farewell, and leaving the place. As to my feelings &s;ince that time, I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that notwith&s;tanding I was at a lo&s;s for &s;ome time whether I &s;hould live or die, my health was &s;o im|paired. I have not &s;een one moment that I was &s;orry I came away, let it be to my honor or di&s;honor; but I am fully per|&s;uaded that I have been under the power of deception and was led by he &s;pirit of error, as to the main principles of faith that I &s;et out upon: but my pre&s;ent feeling and determina|tion is to turn to the good and the right way, which is the new and living way, pointed out by Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, and make it the rule of my li&s;e and conduct.</P>

Now I de&s;ire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o addre&s;s my&s;elf in a few words, to tho&s;e who have or may hereafter come away from the people called Shakers. There has been numbers who have left that peo|ple, who&s;e conduct, I am &s;orry to &s;ay, has been more wicked &amp; prophane than the re&s;t of mankind in general. This is made u&s;e of by the Shakers (as &s;ome of you well know) as an evi|dence that they are the only people of God; applying that &s;cripture in Matthew 12th, 43d, &amp;c. where it &s;peaks of the un|clean &s;pirit going out of a man, and afterwards he takes &s;even other &s;pirits more wicked than him&s;elf, &amp;c. This is applied to all that leave them. They &s;uppo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that they are going to be &s;even times more wicked than ever they were before; or, at lea&s;t, all that leave them and deny any faith in them: but for my part I do not feel under any obligation to be wicked, becau&s;e they think it mu&s;t be &s;o: neither do I feel any lack of the protection of God from the power of evil any more than ever I did; but I feel as fully determined, by the help of God, to do ju&s;tice, love mercy, and walk humbly with God, as ever I did in any part of my life&mdash;and as there are numbers of you that have lived with me, and have heard me &s;peak a great deal again&s;t the fle&s;h, &amp;c. and likely would be glad to hear from me now, in relation to the matter, I would ju&s;t let you know that I feel as much again&s;t the works of the fle&s;h, which is forbid|den in the &s;criptures, as ever I did: but the ordinance and convenant of marriage, between male and female, which was ordained of God, in the garden of Eden before the fall; I be|lieve it is the gift of God now as really as ever it was; but as I have not time to be particular in this matter, I would refer you to a book, written by my ingenious friend, DANIEL RATHBONE, which was publi&s;hed &s;ome years ago, where the matter is fairly and ingeniou&s;ly laid open. But there is anoth|er thing which I de&s;ire to be a little particular in, re&s;pecting &s;ome that have left the Shakers, and have di&s;honored them&s;elves by bad behaviour Although wickedne&s;s is inexcu&s;able when|over it is found, yet &s;ometimes by knowing what the cau&s;e is, we may be able to make &s;ome allowance for the effect. Now in the beginning of our faith there was a great many young children among the believers, which lived chiefly with their parents for a number of years, and the chief part of the teach|ing they had was to &s;ing and dance and labor for mortification. Finally there was a great number gathered to the Church, where they were put under the care of a Mini&s;ter, appointed for that purpo&s;e They were di&s;allowed to have any books that was proper to in&s;truct the mind into the principles of humani|ty. Their teaching was &s;uch as might be expected from tho&s;e who rejected the &s;criptures, rea&s;on, and common &s;en&s;e, as be|ing repugnant to the Go&s;pel. They were, doubtle&s;s, &s;ome of them very vicious in their natures, and ungovernable, therefore
<PB N="25" REF="038359_0024_1011C9F7D5CCDB38">it &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e violent means to &s;ubject them to obedience. This appeared barbarous and cruel, and only ag|gravated their feelings to greater oppo&s;ition. Finally they broke out of their bondage, and went off to the world one after another. Now being taught from their infancy that their was no other people that &s;erved God but the Shakers, and not ha|ving any opportunity to learn any thing to the contrary, they did not know but it was &s;o; and not being able to endure the di&s;cipline in the Church, they renounced that religion; togeth|er with all the re&s;t upon Earth, determining to take their own way, without fearing God or regarding man. Being bred up &s;o entirely ignorant of all the principles of morality, they be|come ea&s;y victims to all manner of evil.&mdash;Others there are, who had arrived to the years of under&s;tanding before they joined the Shakers, and have &s;ince left them, and made a &s;ad figure in the world. Tho&s;e I apprehend are &s;uch as never had any principles of righteou&s;ne&s;s in them, but joined the people out of &s;ome &s;elfi&s;h motives; and not finding their purpo&s;e an&s;wer|ed, return back to their old cour&s;e with an increa&s;e of evil. Now, my friends, as we have made a very extraordinary pro|fe&s;&s;ion, and exalted our&s;elves above the re&s;t of mankind, and have found our&s;elves deceived; do not let us be di&s;couraged of trying to &s;erve God at all; but let us remember that the day will come when we &s;hall all receive a reward according to our works.</P>
<P>Now a few words to tho&s;e whom I have called my brethren and &s;i&s;ters, to wit, the Church in Hancock, called Shakers; although I do not expect you will be allowed by your mini&s;|ters to read what I have here written, yet it may be po&s;&s;ible that &s;ome of you may chance to &s;ee it, which if you do, you will find the real cau&s;e of my coming away from you; for as I was not allowed to open my mind to any one but tho&s;e who labord with me, it was impo&s;&s;ible for you to know the cau&s;e of my affliction fully or the rea&s;on of my leaving you: but thanks be to God, I am now where I have liberty to open my mind without fearing the di&s;plea&s;ure of mortals; but as I under|&s;tand the common proceeding among you in relation to tho&s;e that come away from you, I &s;hall not be di&s;appointed to find my&s;elf exceedingly hated b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ome of you, who, no doubt, be|lieve it your duty to hate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e and execrate me as much as you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, le&s;t you &s;hould lo&s;e your union with your Mini&s;ters and Elders; I &s;ap in this I &s;hall not be di&s;appointed, but &s;hall con&s;ider it to be ju&s;t in relation to me to have the &s;ame meat mea&s;ured to me that I have mea&s;ured to others, though I cannot &s;ay that I have ever felt or allowed my&s;elf to feel &s;uch a &s;pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of revenge as I have ob&s;erved among &s;ome of you A few days before I came away from yon, I heard a man &s;ay, (one that profe&s;&s;ed to be very forward among you) &s;peaking of one
<PB N="26" REF="038359_0025_1011C9FA0F113550">that had lately come off, that he wi&s;hed a tree might fall upon him before he got to the place where he was agoing: and there is &s;ome whom you e&s;teem to be &s;ome of the foremo&s;t among you, who have uttered &s;uch &s;entiments as the&s;e when their cattle got into their neighbor's grain; they thought it was as well for their cattle to eat it as it was for the world to have it, becau&s;e their neighbor, who was the owner of it, was not a Shaker, but of the world. Many more &s;uch like things might be mentioned were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;&s;ary; but I &s;hall only ob|&s;erve, that through a long co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> experience, I have found, that there hath exi&s;ted and &s;till doth exi&s;t a &s;pirit among you which would put all the race of Adam into the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite torture, had they power &s;ufficient, that would not &s;ubject to your faith and profe&s;&s;ion. Now the&s;e things I &s;peak not to reproach you; but my de&s;ire is that you might &s;ee the &s;pirit of <HI>error</HI> by which you are led and renounce it, and embrace the &s;imple doctrines which w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> taught by Chri&s;t and the Apo&s;tles. But there is one thing which hath come to my ears that I un|der&s;tand came from &s;ome of you, to which, it appears to me, I cannot do ju&s;tice to my&s;elf without making &s;ome reply.</P>
<P>I have under&s;tood it has been intimated that while I lived in the Church and profe&s;&s;ed to be &s;trong in faith, that I lived in unlawful connexion with a certain woman, which is &s;ince my wife Now this appears to me to be mean and ill u&s;age, and beneath the Church of Chri&s;t, even if it was true. You may remember, doubtle&s;s, &s;ome of you, what I &s;poke to you a few days before I come away&mdash;I told you if any of you had any thing again&s;t me, or knew any wickedne&s;s of me to tell me of it before I came away, &s;o that I might confe&s;s it and leave it with you, and not &s;erve me as you did the re&s;t, as &s;oon as they were gone, then to try to rake up every thing you could again&s;t them. Now why was you not &s;o kind, if you knew the&s;e things, as to tell me of it while I was there, for I pre&s;ume you knew as much about it then as you do now. However I will tell you the &s;imple truth, as I expect to an&s;wer in to God my creator. From the time that I fir&s;t profe&s;&s;ed chri&s;tianity (which was a year or two before I heard of the people called Shakers) to this day, I never have had any un|lawful connexion with any wom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, nor never in the cour&s;e of my life did I ever defile my&s;elf with &s;trange fle&s;h; and from the time I fir&s;t knew the Shakers to this time, I never defiled my&s;elf with what is called among you <HI>effeminacy;</HI> neither did I ever know by any certain knowledge, while I lived with you, that there was any females in the Church or any where el&s;e, except it was at the time when there was &s;uch a gift for men and women to &s;trip naked and go into the water together, &amp;c. I was &s;ome times a &s;pectator, and perhaps might ob&s;erve the difference; but as to the wom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n which is now my wife, I
<PB N="27" REF="038359_0026_1011C9FDD40503E8">never knew whether &s;he was male or female till after I was le|gally married to her; and as to my making any agreement with her to come away from the Church, I never did, fir&s;t nor la&s;t, for I never &s;poke a &s;ingle word to her about one thing or another, after I was determined to come away, till a few min|utes before I came away; then I &s;poke with her and gave her the offer of my friend&s;hip and protection, if God &s;pared my life, if it was her choice to follow me.</P>
<P>Now there are &s;ome things which I have hinted that many of you are ignorant of, which I feel it my duty to open more plainly. It is well known to you that the foundation of our hope was built upon our faith in the fir&s;t Mother, William Leas and James Whittaker, believing that they were redeem|ed from all &s;in and were equal unto the Angels of God. I have hinted &s;omething about the contention there was among them; now I will tell you what I &s;aw with my own eyes, I was at <HI>Ni&s;kauna</HI> with the Mother and the Elders. At length there was a contention broke out, which &s;eemed chiefly to be between the Mother and William Leas; it kept increa&s;ing till there was nothing but clamor and confu&s;ion. Finally the Mother fell to beating William Leas&mdash;&s;miting of him in the face&mdash;he tried to defend off her blows, threatening to &s;mite her if &s;he did not let him alone. There was a number of people pre&s;ent, who, mo&s;t of them, &s;eemed to join with the Mother, and labored to keep William Leas from hurting her, for there was awful threatning on both &s;ides; however the mother would not let him alone, but notwith&s;tanding his activity in defending him&s;elf would very often get a blow at him, till his face was in a gore of blood: at length, as he could endure it no longer, he &s;mote her with his fi&s;t, and being a very &s;trong man I un|der&s;tood that he hurt her very much, but &s;he did not fall quite to the floor, if I remember right, the people being &s;o thick held her up. I &s;tood the chief part of time not more than five or &s;ix feet from them, and &s;aw the whole of what I have de|&s;cribed, and I think I have not exaggerated it one mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">l, but have rather come &s;hort; for as I have had con&s;iderable op|portunity in the cour&s;e of my life both in the army among &s;oldiers and el&s;ewhere, I never &s;aw any contention that ap|peared more contrary to the Go&s;pel: notwith&s;tanding, at that time, my faith and imagination w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;uch, that I dared not judge there was any thing in the Mother that was wrong: but &s;ince I have found by inconte&s;tible evidence that I have been deceived, and have given my&s;elf liberty to exerci&s;e the rational faculties that God has created in me, it appears to me that the Mother, at that time, was very much overcome with &s;trong liquor, and was under the influence and power of Satan; and there is &s;ome among you now, or at lea&s;t was the la&s;t I heard from them, that can &s;ay, if they would be hone&s;t, that I have
<PB N="28" REF="038359_0027_1011CA02C602F0C0">&s;poke but a little part of what they &s;ee and heard from time to time, as they had more opportunity than I There is one among you, or was when I came away, that told me a few months ago that he was there at the time I was and lived there &s;ome time after: he &s;ignified they were in contention almo&s;t continually; &s;ometimes between the Mother and William Leas, and &s;ometime between the Mother and James Whittaker &mdash;he told as to their language, there never was a &s;ailor &s;tep|ped on board a &s;hip that exceeded them&mdash;he told me the Mother charged Whittaker with committing whoredom with a certain woman; Whittaker declared his innocence, &amp;c&mdash; This man that told me this I &s;uppo&s;e is now among you and means to &s;tay, for aught that I know; but you your&s;elves, &s;ome of you, believe, or at lea&s;t have believed, that there is &s;ome among you who are in Authority, that are no more Shakers in heart and principle than the re&s;t of the world, but &s;tay among you out of &s;elfi&s;h motives.</P>
<P>There is many things I &s;hould be glad to &s;ay to you, but as I expect it is unlikely many of you will ever &s;ee what I have wrote &s;o long as you remain in your bondage, I &s;hall clo&s;e my matter by ju&s;t ob&s;erving, that my experience among the Shakers appears to me like a man that has been following an <HI>ignis fatuus,</HI> which is &s;omething which he &s;uppo&s;es to be light, and &s;ets out to go to it, but never gets any nearer to it, but follows it till he is led into a di&s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al wilderne&s;s of darkne&s;s, and then it di&s;appears; &s;o it &s;eems has been the ca&s;e with me. It appears to me that I turned my eyes off from that light which God had appointed for &s;ouls to look to, and thought I &s;ee a light &s;ome where el&s;e, but in following after it I found it was always out vonder, till finally it led me into a di&s;mal &s;wamp, and then di&s;appeared, where I had to get out as well as I could; but I am thankful to God that I have &s;o far got out that I hope I am able, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to di&s;cover things as they be; and may God grant that you all may receive the &s;ame help and grace of God to bring you out of your darkne&s;s into the true light of the glorious Go&s;pel of the Son of God, &s;o that you may be happy in this world and that which is to come, which is the &s;incere de&s;ire of</P>
