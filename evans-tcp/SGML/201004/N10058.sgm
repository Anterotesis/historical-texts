<HEAD>A LETTER, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">GAIFER to ALY-BEN-HAYTON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> HAYTON,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_YOU cannot be ignorant that the im|perfect, tho' awakening Information given me of the the Chri&s;tian Religi|on, by an Engli&s;h &s;lave under capti|vity, to our bigotted Mehometan neighbour, <HI>Abdala,</HI> put me upon a re&s;tle&s;s de&s;ire of a farther knowlege therein. This, I was convinced, could not be obtained in my pre&s;ent unhappy &s;ituation; being in a country, where it is death to give the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of favoring the Chri&s;|tian profe&s;&s;ion; where every eye, and every ear were dangerous watchers over all my behaviour: Therefore it was, with all the caution cece&s;&s;ary to &s;o hazardous an attempt, I happily got on board the <HI>Expedition,</HI> bound from <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>When I came to <HI>England,</HI> as &s;oon as I had op|portunity of making my ob&s;ervations, I found that the Chri&s;tian religion was in general pro|fe&s;&s;ed thro'out this kingdom. But notwith|&s;tanding the purity it enjoins, it appeared that the generality of its profe&s;&s;ors were very loo&s;e in their morals, profane in their di&s;cour&s;e, and de|bauched in their lives. I al&s;o found that the profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity were divided into ma|ny religious &s;ects, and, what is much to be de|plored,
<PB N="4" REF="012778_0003_0F8A932A519CB290">each carry their oppo&s;ition, for the mo&s;t part again&s;t the other to that height of invete|racy, as if they wor&s;hipped not the &s;ame GOD.</P>
<P>This put me upon farther enquiry into the principles of the Chri&s;tian Religion; a ta&s;k difficult enough for a &s;tranger to undertake, who had then but a &s;mall acquaintance with the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> tongue. But that impediment was remov|ed in a &s;horter time than was expected, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a humane, &s;ober Gentleman, who&s;e profe&s;&s;ion was to teach the languages, and in|&s;truct his pupils in the religion of his country. He took much pains in teaching me both; and furni&s;hed me with &s;uch books as were nece&s;&s;ary, particularly that which they call the <HI>Bible,</HI> which is to Chri&s;tians what the <HI>Alcoran</HI> is to the Me|hometans. This is their perfect rule of faith, and contains a full declaration of the will of GOD, with a full account of future rewards and puni&s;hments for the good and evil.</P>
<P>As I read the&s;e &s;acred pages with an unpre|judiced mind, and a de&s;ire of information, I &s;oon found how mi&s;taken I had been concerning the terms of man's acceptance with GOD, and of his final &s;alvation; namely, that it is <HI>not by works of righteou&s;ne&s;s which we had done, but according to his mercy he &s;aved us, by the wa&s;hing of regene|ration, and the renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t;</HI> and that <HI>by grace we are &s;aved, through faith, and that not of our&s;elves, it</HI> [even faith] <HI>is the gift of God.</HI> I clearly &s;aw, according to this book, <HI>That to him that could not work,</HI> previous to his ju&s;tification, <HI>but believeth on Je&s;us Chri&s;t, his righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> be|ing received by faith, <HI>is imputed to him for ju&s;tifi|cation.</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="012778_0004_0F8A932BEA979468">I &s;aw al&s;o both the nature and extent of the moral Law; the fall of man by the tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion of <HI>Adam,</HI> our general root and repre&s;en|tative; that the fir&s;t covenant being broken, man was utterly unable to obtain &s;alvation there|by; and that Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the &s;econd <HI>Adam,</HI> came into the world to be the &s;aviour and living head of all that believe in him: For them he fulfilled the law; for them he &s;atisfied divine ju&s;tice; and that the only way to eternal life, was, by receiving his righteou&s;ne&s;s, which is imputed to all them that believe.</P>
<P>When I began to under&s;tand &s;omething of the differences among&s;t the various profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity, I found them all remote from the tenor of &s;cripture; that all within the circle of my acquaintance, &s;eemed totally to neglect tho&s;e doctrines the holy &s;criptures made ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation, and warmly to con|tend for <HI>forms</HI> and <HI>modes,</HI> and whatever the Bible was either quite &s;ilent about, or laid no &s;tre&s;s upon. But what I wondered at mo&s;t of all was, that tho&s;e who are called Clergymen, and are by the laws of their country, &s;eparated from the re&s;t of the people, to teach the principles and practice of their holy religion, are, for the mo&s;t part, the greate&s;t &s;trangers to the e&s;&s;ence of the Go&s;pel. As for their lives, they are as vain, trifling and irreligious as any others. They frequent all public theatres, balls, and the vile&s;t a&s;&s;emblies; in &s;hort, they are a common reproach, a public &s;candal, and the very hindrance of others repentance, but &s;till they call them&s;elves the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, the Amba&s;&s;adors of Je|&s;us
<PB N="6" REF="012778_0005_0F8A932CA8F1FAB8">Chri&s;t; and expect to be reverenced of all men, for being the followers of his humility, his contempt of the world, and purity of life.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I could form no other judg|ment of the divinity of the go&s;pel from the de|portment of the bulk of its profe&s;&s;ors, and e&s;pe|cially of their teachers&punc; than that it was a cun|ning fable, devi&s;ed only to aggrandize a &s;et of men that call <HI>them&s;elves</HI> the <HI>Clergy.</HI> Their pub|lic exhortations faintly recommend a conduct of life, &s;uch as they them&s;elves are mo&s;tly &s;trangers to; though it be no more than a little dry <HI>Hea|then</HI> mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ity: From all this I could &s;ee them in no other light, than tho very enemies to the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, the greate&s;t oppo&s;ers of the true Chri|&s;tianity, and deceivers of the people.</P>
<P>Thus, my dear <HI>Hayton,</HI> in&s;tead of the real happine&s;s I promi&s;ed my&s;elf in the &s;ociety of Chri&s;tians, and the glorious privileges of their religion, &s;o recommended and adorned by that poor exiled &s;lave, I met with very little el&s;e here in this Chri&s;tian land (&s;o called) but infidelity and profane&s;s; which &s;ore di&s;appointment har|dened my heart again&s;t all religion whatever. What could I then conclude, but that the <HI>Bible</HI> was a cheat, and their religion a craft? And I had well nigh re&s;olved to loo&s;e the reins of my pa&s;&s;ion, and follow the multitude to do evil.</P>
<P>But one <HI>Sabbath</HI> evening (and let me not for|get that day!) as I was taking a &s;olitary walk, mu&s;ing on the&s;e things, I pa&s;&s;ed by a very crou|ded a&s;&s;embly of people. Led, as I thought, by curio&s;ity, I entered the place with no little con|tempt in my heart. But, O my <HI>Hayton!</HI> how
<PB N="7" REF="012778_0006_0F8A932E85578208">&s;hall I de&s;cribe the &s;trange emotions I felt, whil&s;t joy &s;at upon the countenances of tho&s;e about me. The &s;olemnity of the place, and the awful behaviour of the a&s;&s;embly was &s;uch as I had ne|ver &s;een before; and what &s;truck me with won|der and deep attention, one &s;pirit &s;eemed to ani|mate the whole body; and what one man offer|ed up in prayer, the re&s;t made their joint reque&s;t to GOD for.</P>
<P>O what I felt when I heard the KING of Kings addre&s;&s;ed in the&s;e words! <HI>Gird thy &s;word upon thy thigh, O thou mo&s;t mighty, and in thy maje&s;ty ride pro&s;perou&s;ly upon the word of truth, meekne&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s&mdash;Thine arrows are very &s;harp in the heart of the King's enemies.</HI> I trembled; and though I doubted if I had not better fly away, I could not. I dared not leave the awful place. Prayer being ended, from the &s;acred ora|cles the man of GOD read the&s;e words, <HI>Except a man be born again, he cannot &s;ee the kingdom of God.</HI> He &s;hewed both the holine&s;s of that GOD with whom we have to do; the great <HI>de&s;ign</HI> of redemption by Je&s;us Chri&s;t; the depravity of our &s;ouls, and the nature of that happine&s;s which is &s;et before us; the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of being born again, in order to obtain a pre&s;ent pardon, and per&s;evere to future &s;alvation. He not only proved the nece&s;&s;ity of our regenerati|on from the&s;e, and many other &s;ub&s;tantial argu|ments, but there was &s;omething like a judgment &s;eat &s;et up in my own con&s;cience. I was by &s;ome power, more than human, indicted, ar|raigned, proved guilty, and condemned. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> actions of my life were now laid open be|fore
<PB N="8" REF="012778_0007_0F8A932EC73415F0">me; I was compelled to a&s;&s;ent to what I never knew before, namely, that all my &s;inful actions proceeded from a corrupt fountain&punc; a nature univer&s;ally depraved and polluted. Each &s;entence he &s;pake, came with authority and con|viction to my heart; e&s;pecially &s;uch as the&s;e; <HI>Every mouth mu&s;t be &s;topped, and all the world</HI> (even they that have not the written law) <HI>become guilty before God No man can redeem his brother, nor give unto God a ran&s;om for him. He that be|lieveth on Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;hall be &s;aved; and he that believeth not &s;hall be damned.</HI> Now it was that my heart failed within me! I groaned in &s;pirit. I cried, I am undone! My &s;ins are gone over my head. The remembrance of them is griev|ous, and the burden of them is intolerable.</P>
<P>When all was ended, I &s;trove with all my might to conceal the confu&s;ion of my mind from tho&s;e happier &s;ouls I was &s;urrounded with; but &s;ome of them perceived my concern; and one &s;aid to me, with tears in his eyes, "The Saviour of &s;inners have mercy on thee, and re|veal him&s;elf to thy &s;oul! But, O, my load was great! I returned with a heavy heart.</P>
<P>When I entered my clo&s;et, I threw my&s;elf pro&s;taate on the ground, and attempted to pray. But it was long before I could &s;peak a word. At length, under &s;ome heart meltings, and in broken accents, I cried out, <Q>O Lord GOD; the maker of all things, and the governor of the world, unto thee all power belongs; thou can&s;t kill, and make alive&mdash;mercifully be|hold a poor, mi&s;erable &s;inner&mdash;ruined and undone&mdash;I confe&s;s, O GOD, that I have
<PB N="9" REF="012778_0008_0F8A9331642F0020">ju&s;tly de&s;erved eternal death; and it is alone of thy &s;paring hand that I am yet alive.&mdash; Thou can&s;t, in a moment, cru&s;h me to death, and in ju&s;t vengeance de&s;troy me forever&mdash; But, O my GOD, glorify thy&s;elf in the &s;alva|tion even of &s;uch a wretch as I am!&mdash;O be merciful to me a &s;inner!&mdash;For the &s;ake of all thy goodne&s;s, and all that whereby thou make&s;t it known! Turn me, even <HI>me,</HI> and &s;ave me forever and ever!</Q></P>
<P>After &s;ome time I ro&s;e from the ground; but in great di&s;traction of mind. Sometimes I had thoughts of going in &s;earch of the preacher, in hopes of finding relief from him; but this &s;eem|ed impracticable, it being now late in the even|ing; and be&s;ides I knew not where to &s;eek him. Then I condemned my&s;elf for not having enqui|red where he lived, and looked upon this neglect as a bad omen. It now darted into my mind, whether or no the mini&s;ter I had heard was re|ally a man of like pa&s;&s;ions with others, or rather an angel &s;ent from GOD. In the multitude of my thoughts within me, I ca&s;t my eye upon my quite neglected <HI>Bible,</HI> which I had before care|le&s;ly thrown a&s;ide, finding it &s;o little regarded by the generality of tho&s;e called Chri&s;tians. I read, and pondered, and read on; but alas! every line &s;eemed to militate again&s;t me; and in&s;tead of mini&s;tring relief, to encrea&s;e my tor|ment. I clo&s;ed the book, and pau&s;ed, then opened it again, and found the&s;e words. <HI>The &s;orrows of death compa&s;&s;ed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me; I found trouble and &s;orrow. Then called I upon the name of the Lord; O Lord, I
<PB N="10" REF="012778_0009_0F8A93333211F670">be&s;eech thee, deliver my &s;oul.</HI> This &s;cripture, for a moment, conveyed &s;ome light and comfort to me in my di&s;tre&s;s. I &s;aw my ca&s;e was not, as I &s;uppo&s;ed, peculiar to my&s;elf. I &s;aid, &s;urely this man has been in like trouble of &s;oul, and has felt the pains of hell too; and yet the Lord gra|ciou&s;ly delivered him out of all.</P>
<P>But this &s;mall glimmering of light was &s;oon extingui&s;hed: All that night I had no re&s;t. My &s;lumberings were attended with a&s;toni&s;hing terror&mdash;Death, judgment, and eternal de&s;tructi|on was all I could &s;ee, and all I could hear; and a terrible &s;ound it was. The preacher's text was continually ringing in my ears, <HI>Except a man be born again, he cannot &s;ee the kingdom of heaven.</HI> For &s;ome time I confined my&s;elf to my room; hardly took &s;o much &s;u&s;tenance as was &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve me alive. The comforts of this life were now bla&s;ted. Hay under &s;harp convictions. <HI>The arrows of the Almighty &s;tuck fa&s;t in me; they drank up my &s;pirits, whil&s;t his hand pre&s;&s;ed me &s;ore:</HI> Then cried I, <HI>What mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved?</HI> At other times I was more ea&s;y; then again under amazing horror and dread, becau&s;e I was &s;o thoughtle&s;s and &s;tupid, while my ca&s;e was &s;o dreadful. I was often under violent temptations to de&s;troy my&s;elf, and &s;o put an end to a wretched life; for I thought, &s;urely the longer I live, the more &s;in I commit; con&s;equently my puni&s;hment mu&s;t be greater in the end. Then was I without hope of delive|rance, and concluded, the &s;ooner I put an end to my mi&s;ery the better. Now and then I had a &s;mall tran&s;ient gleam of light darting into my
<PB N="11" REF="012778_0010_0F8A9333591A77C8">&s;oul, which, for the time it la&s;ted, gave me &s;ome hope of deliverance; at lea&s;t a peradventure that the Lord might have mercy on &s;o vile a wretch as me.</P>
<P>At this &s;ea&s;on I was led to di&s;cover more clear|ly the &s;ecret workings of corruption in my heart. The Spirit of God convinced me, that my under&s;tanding was by nature blind and ig|norant, <HI>'till God, who cau&s;ed the light to &s;hine out of darkne&s;s, &s;hines into the heart, to give the know|lege of his glory in the face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> I &s;aw more than ever, that my will was &s;tubborn and perver&s;e, even to an enmity again&s;t the law of GOD; al&s;o that my affections were all di&s;orderly, impure, &s;en&s;ual, and devili&s;h; and what was even beyond this, that I could not love the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who had done and &s;uffered &s;o much on my account. I felt that all my de&s;igns wholly terminated in my&s;elf. I was &s;piritually and ra|tionally convinced, that for me to deny natural, moral, and religious <HI>Self,</HI> and come to Chri&s;t as a poor, mi&s;erable, wretched, empty creature to live upon his righteou&s;ne&s;s forever, as my <HI>Bible</HI> directed me, is as &s;upernatural and wonderful as to &s;ee the mountains and hills removed, and ca&s;t into the depth of the &s;ea. I now began to feel more than ever what I had before read in the <HI>Bible,</HI> but could not comprehend&mdash;that &s;alvation was entirely of <HI>grace</HI>&mdash;that nothing le&s;s than &s;overeign grace could &s;ave my &s;oul from the guilt and dominion of &s;in, and make me a par|taker of the glorious privileges of the &s;ons of GOD.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="012778_0011_0F8A933499C16A10">
During this confinement, my courteous friend, who before had taken &s;uch pains to in|&s;truct me in the manners and language of the country, made me a vi&s;it. He was greatly &s;ur|pri&s;ed to &s;ee my countenance &s;o fallen, and kind|ly enquired into the cau&s;e. As he was called a <HI>Teacher in I&s;rael,</HI> and one that I had often heard animadvert warmly on the bad behaviour of the generality of his brethren; I &s;imply related the trouble I was in, and what I apprehended was the cau&s;e of it, and what I more than feared mu&s;t be the fatal con&s;equence. He looked earne&s;tly at me, and with concern in his countenance re|plied, <Q>I pity your condition from my heart. Your di&s;order is a religious di&s;traction of mind, which we call <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> we have a great deal of this in <HI>England</HI> The per&s;on you heard preach, and who was the cau&s;e of your trouble, is a <HI>grand Deceiver,</HI> one who&s;e con&s;tant employment is to <HI>turn the world up&s;ide down!</HI> Not being content with the happy e&s;tabli&s;hed form of religion, he has got &s;ome novel wild chimeras in his head; and being fired with the irrational ideas of his own brain, he frightens his poor deluded followers out of their &s;en&s;es; mo&s;t of whom are poor illiterate per&s;ons, the <HI>very filth and off &s;couring of the world.</HI> My advice to you, Sir, &s;aid he, is ne|ver to go near them more by any means. At|tend the regular &s;tated &s;ervice of our excellent church: go abroad into chearful company; &s;hake off that coro&s;ive melancholy, and re&s;ume your wonted &s;prightline&s;s. God is a merciful Being, and does not require &s;o much &s;trictne&s;s
<PB N="13" REF="012778_0012_0F8A9334CFBEC6E8">at our hands. You may u&s;e the plea&s;ures of this life, love the world, and go to heaven too</Q></P>
<P>I a&s;ked him the meaning of tho&s;e words. <HI>Except a man be born again, he cannot &s;ee the king|dom of God.</HI> He &s;aid. <Q>You mu&s;t be bapti&s;ed, and lead a moral, &s;ober life; but not think to receive the Holy Spirit.</Q></P>
<P>Now I &s;aw what he was; and knew that if he was <HI>right</HI> the word of God was <HI>wrong;</HI> if the word of God was <HI>truth,</HI> he mu&s;t be in <HI>error</HI> and <HI>delu&s;ion.</HI> He left me grievou&s;ly oppre&s;&s;ed and heavy laden with &s;in. I was under the cleare&s;t conviction, both from what the preacher decla|red, and what I read in the Bible, that no righ|teou&s;ne&s;s could &s;erve to ju&s;tify my per&s;on at the tribunal of a ju&s;t and holy God, but that which is altogether perfect, fully commen&s;urate to the utmo&s;t Demands of the moral Law. This I more than &s;aw was altogether impo&s;&s;ible for me to perform In fine, I found my acquaintance was a phy&s;ician of no value, altogether a &s;tran|ger to my di&s;order, and quite unacquainted with the only &s;overeign remedy for peri&s;hing &s;ouls: ju&s;t then came into my mind &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages I had read in my Bible of fal&s;e prophets, who cry <HI>Peace, peace, when there is no peace;</HI> and the ble&s;&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> of Chri&s;tianity's words. <HI>Beware of fal&s;e prophets, who are only blind leaders of the blind;</HI> I was enabled to take the&s;e hints, and to beware of falling into the ditch with him.</P>
<P>I lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">ed exceedingly for the return of the next Lord's Day; re&s;olved to go, (notwith|&s;tanding all the Doctor &s;aid) to the &s;ame place,
<PB N="14" REF="012778_0013_0F8A93358E6C71A0">where God had &s;o wonderfully wrought upon my &s;oul before.</P>
<P>The ble&s;&s;ed morning being come, I wor&s;hip|ped the God of heaven in fervent prayer, com|mitted my body, &s;oul and concerns to him, and begged that this day might be a fea&s;t of marrow and fat things to my &s;oul; and &s;oon ha&s;ted to the a&s;&s;embly of &s;aints. And as they began their wor&s;hip &s;ooner than mo&s;t others, I was again a little too late. The &s;ame mini&s;ter was there, and my very heart leaped at the &s;ound of his voice. He was ju&s;t taking the&s;e &s;oul-reviving words for the &s;ubject of his di&s;cour&s;e&mdash;<HI>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you re&s;t.</HI> He told us, that this was the voice of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf, inviting weary, hungry, peri&s;hing &s;ouls, to a fea&s;t of mercy and grace. And in order to pre|vail upon his hearers to accept the invitation, he &s;hewed, 1 That the burden of &s;in is a heavy burden. 2. That the Spirit of God always makes us feel that burden, and groan to be de|livered, before we find re&s;t. 3. That Je&s;us Chri&s;t only can give re&s;t to the weary &s;oul. 4. That he will do it to all that come unto him; namely, to all that believe. He in&s;i&s;ted upon all the&s;e points, and was large in the inferences he drew from them. Then concluded in prayer and prai&s;e.</P>
<P>During the whole time, the mo&s;t devout af|fections were to be di&s;cerned in the whole a&s;|&s;embly. As for me, I found that every word was exactly levelled at my heart. He could not have &s;poke more pertinently to my ca&s;e, if
<PB N="15" REF="012778_0014_0F8A93366CD5EBA8">I had told him all the exerci&s;es of my di&s;tracted mind. I &s;ometimes thought he had &s;urely been informed of all my griefs, and hence he direct|ed his di&s;cour&s;e <HI>only to me.</HI> He opened all my di&s;ea&s;e, probed the wound to the bottom; and it was as though I was &s;haken over the mouth of hell. Then he applied the precious <HI>balm of Gilead,</HI> he preached Je&s;us Chri&s;t in all his offices, e&s;pecially as the glorious Phy&s;ician, who heals the wounded con&s;cience, for his own name's &s;ake.</P>
<P>In the application of the whole, he &s;hewed the many hindrances which lie in the way; and the perplexing doubts and &s;lavi&s;h fears which po&s;&s;e&s;s the burdened con&s;cience at its fir&s;t com|ing to Chri&s;t; and withal, how able and willing he is to receive and give them re&s;t. My &s;oul failed within me. My &s;pirits &s;unk under the weight of a comfortable hope, that Je&s;us would have mercy on <HI>me,</HI> even <HI>me!</HI></P>
<P>Ju&s;t as he drew to a conclu&s;ion, he rai&s;ed his voice, and with great earne&s;tne&s;s quoted the&s;e words; <HI>I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions&punc; for mine own &s;ake, and will not re|member thy &s;ins, &s;aith the Lord.</HI> The ble&s;&s;ed Spirit applied them home to my &s;oul, and wrote them, by the finger of God, upon the Table of my heart; in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, the &s;cales fell from my eyes! I beheld <HI>Je&s;us of Nazareth</HI> by the eye of faith&punc; as evidently crucified before me&mdash;bearing my &s;ins in his own body on the accur&s;ed tree. The pri&s;on doors were thrown open; my &s;oul, that was before bound in mi&s;ery and iron, and locked it in the
<PB N="16" REF="012778_0015_0F8A933707024FC0">pri&s;on of unbelief, was now &s;et at liberty, God helped me to come as a poor peri&s;hing, undone &s;inner, and ca&s;t my &s;oul upon Je&s;us Chri&s;t! O he graciou&s;ly received me; and according to the multitude of his mercies, and the faithful|ne&s;s of his promi&s;e, he <HI>blotted out all my &s;ins!</HI> I received Chri&s;t into my heart, <HI>the hope of glory;</HI> and he put a new &s;ong in my mouth even prai&s;es unto God for his <HI>di&s;criminating grace!</HI></P>
<Q><L>&mdash;He hath lov'd me, I cry'd,</L>
<L>He hath liv'd and hath dy'd</L>
<L>To redeem &s;uch a rebel as me!</L></Q>
<P>O my dear <HI>Hayton,</HI> I cannot de&s;cribe the thou&s;andth part of that tran&s;port of joy, that &s;ub&s;tantial bli&s;s I then felt; and ble&s;&s;ed be God, <HI>even now,</HI> while I am writing. I yet feel it in my &s;oul; I was in a moment tran&s;lated from dark|ne&s;s to light; from &s;ickne&s;s to health; from pain to ea&s;e; from mi&s;ery to happine&s;s; from bondage to liberty; from death to life: Yea, I may truly &s;ay, from hell to heaven!</P>
<P>Had I but one wi&s;h left, it &s;hould be, that my dear friend, even while he reads the lan|guage of my happy &s;oul, <HI>might ta&s;te and &s;ee how good and gracious the Lord is!</HI> might him&s;elf feel the &s;weetne&s;s, life and power of Chri&s;t!</P>
<P>Well, my &s;oul is concerned for, and, I tru&s;t, I &s;hall always remember <HI>thee.</HI> my <HI>Hayton!</HI> and when I bow before the throne of Je&s;us, O let my prayers come up before him, and be heard for you.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="012778_0016_0F8A933833860488">
Now I begun to live. From this moment commenced my <HI>&s;piritual</HI> and <HI>eternal</HI> life, <HI>which is hid with Chri&s;t in God.</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t is become to me a head of influence, and I daily <HI>receive out of his fulne&s;s grace for grace</HI> The whole body of &s;in is condemned in the fla&s;h, and has already received its mortal wound. Je&s;us gave me to drink of the living water, and it &s;lows, and ever will flow unto eternal life. The &s;un of righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hines with a new light into my <HI>under&s;tanding,</HI> &s;ets a new bya&s;s to my <HI>will,</HI> and all the <HI>pa&s;&s;ions</HI> and <HI>affections</HI> of my &s;oul run in a <HI>new channel.</HI> In a word, the Holy Gho&s;t has wrought a real, thorough change in my heart; all old things are done away, and all things are become NEW: for being now become dead to the law, and married to Chri&s;t, I am enabled to bring <HI>forth fruits unto God</HI></P>
<P>But O! when I view my intere&s;t in CHRIST, and con&s;ider what an inexhau&s;tible fund of <HI>grace, &s;trength,</HI> and <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> is ledged for me in the Redeemer's hands; this proves the &s;weete&s;t and mo&s;t powerful engagement to all evangelical obedience, and the only &s;pring of all true con&s;olation.</P>
<P>May the dear IMMANUEL draw thy heart into union with his glorious per&s;on, which is eternal life! Then, and not till then, you &s;hall enjoy a kingdom of heaven in your own brea&s;t, a very paradi&s;e in your &s;oul, un&s;peakably better than what the <HI>Alchoran</HI> deludes us with a fal&s;e expectation of.</P>
<P>If it be &s;o, my dear <HI>Hayton,</HI> as it really is, that all real Chri&s;tians are thus happy in a world
<PB N="18" REF="012778_0017_0F8A933A0C8E2838">of woe, and under the incumbrances of fle&s;h and blood; how tran&s;cendantly glorious, how un&s;peakably happy mu&s;t they be, when the&s;e impediments are removed! when the &s;oul be|comes at liberty to range the whole paradi&s;e of GOD and ta&s;te the joys of infinite delights!&mdash; And thus &s;hall it be done unto every man whom Je&s;us delights to honor.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t farther relate to you, that when I had the happine&s;s of being acquainted with the <HI>Evangeli&s;t</HI> that fir&s;t brought the glad tidings to my ears, and by who&s;e mini&s;try the grace of GOD reached my heart, I related my experience to him, and a few of his intimate friends. O how did they weep for joy over me! They &s;trengthened my faith in Chri&s;t, and gave glory to GOD, who had added another lo&s;t &s;inner to his militant church. The&s;e knew how to &s;ym|pathize with me, when I lay under the <HI>wrath of God,</HI> the cur&s;es of the <HI>law,</HI> and the <HI>terrors of con&s;cience;</HI> for by comparing <HI>notes,</HI> our expe|riences exactly tallied, as <HI>face an&s;wereth face in a gla&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>But here give me leave to make a few ob&s;er|vations of another kind.</P>
<P>The Chri&s;tian religion is. I pre&s;ume, not only to be demon&s;trated by the Spirit's &s;ecret opera|tions in the &s;oul, but it may be proved from rational grounds, to be a &s;y&s;tem altogether agreeable to <HI>right rea&s;on,</HI> and the moral <HI>fitne&s;s of things.</HI> For what &s;o fit <HI>for,</HI> and &s;uitable <HI>to</HI> a lo&s;t, ungodly, helple&s;s &s;inner, as an all &s;ufficient SAVIOUR! What &s;o &s;uitable to the weary, as re&s;t; to the hungry, as bread; to the thir&s;ty, as
<PB N="19" REF="012778_0018_0F8A933ACDBDE9F0">water; to the naked, as a garment; to the blind, as &s;ight, &amp;c. All the&s;e, and many more &s;triking metaphors, has the Holy Spirit mo&s;t elegantly, borrowed from the creature, to &s;hew how rea|&s;onable a thing it is that we &s;hould believe on the LORD JESUS CHRIST unto eternal life.</P>
<P>No man can be forced to believe again&s;t his rea&s;on, or love again&s;t his will, or de&s;ire again&s;t his inclination. Therefore the Spirit of GOD fir&s;t enlightens the under&s;tanding that it may <HI>di&s;cern;</HI> the <HI>will</HI> and <HI>offections</HI> then naturally flow after. The &s;oul is fir&s;t drawn to JESUS as if it would not come; and then it comes as if it were not drawn. <HI>He drew me with the cords of love, as with the bands of a man. And this is a faithful &s;aying, and worthy of all acceptation.</HI> (even of our enlightened age;) <HI>That Chri&s;t Je&s;us came into the world to &s;ave &s;inners.</HI></P>
<P>And I found that the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e, whom I have been &s;peaking of, could each &s;ay for him&s;elf, from the real experience of the heart, <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath loved me, and given him|&s;elf for me.</HI> And the whole of their deportment and conver&s;ation in the world, &s;hews them to be per&s;ons full of genuine humility, unaffected &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, being mild and gentle; free from all &s;elfi&s;h de&s;ign; wholly devoted to JESUS CHRIST, and earne&s;tly &s;eeking the good of all their fellow creatures; and yet (wonderful to relate!) the&s;e people are contemned by almo&s;t all profe&s;&s;ors, both teachers and hearers; yea, they are per&s;ecuted, and loaded with all the
<PB N="20" REF="012778_0019_0F8A933CA8FF0A78">obloquy that inveterate malice can &s;ugge&s;t; and all the oppo&s;ition that can be contrived to prevent the &s;preading of the glorious go&s;pel, and the increa&s;e of the genuine followers of the exalted Redeemer Nay, the&s;e that di&s;agree in all other religious points, yet are unanimous in this that they will root one, if po&s;&s;ible, their memorial from the face of the earth.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding all the oppo&s;ition they meet with, the meekne&s;s, patience, and per&s;e|verance of the&s;e Chri&s;tians, both mini&s;ters and people (for I under&s;tand there are many more of the &s;ame &s;pirit) &s;urmounts all difficulties, and their numbers daily increa&s;e. And why not? &s;eeing the wonderful conver&s;ions that are among them, are &s;urely enough to engage the greate&s;t &s;ceptic in religion, to believe that the mighty power of GOD is with them!</P>
<P>O that our countrymen would but admit this true go&s;pel of Chri&s;t among&s;t them! Surely if it were preached by &s;ome of the&s;e de&s;pi&s;ed me&s;&s;engers of the living GOD, they would, I doubt not, thro' <HI>divine grace,</HI> embrace the truth as it is in Je&s;us; and be a reproach to this na|tion, who re&s;i&s;t the calls of God: And though they are called by his name, will not have this man, this God man Chri&s;t Je&s;us, to reign over them.</P>
<P>Oh! how fatally &s;ucce&s;sful has the enemy of mankind been, by engaging in his intere&s;t that very power, which by primitive go&s;pel in&s;titu|tion, was ordained as a barrier between the peo|ple and his &s;ubtil inventions: Surely he has gained his point, by bribing the <HI>watchmen</HI> with
<PB N="21" REF="012778_0020_0F8A933D0359B250">riches, power, and plea&s;ure; &s;o that while they riot in luxurious ea&s;e, the poor &s;ouls under their mi&s;taken care, fall an ea&s;y, willing &s;acrifice to his rapacious power. Woe, woe to the <HI>watch|men,</HI> and woe to the <HI>people!</HI> for the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of <HI>tho&s;e</HI> will not extenuate the guilt of <HI>the&s;e. If the blind lead the blind, both &s;hall fall in the ditch together.</HI> But every &s;oul &s;hall be required at the watchman's hand.</P>
<P>It appears to me, that this <HI>corrupt mini&s;try</HI> is a greater enemy to their nation than the mo&s;t formidable powers about them; for <HI>tho&s;e,</HI> at the wor&s;t, can but annoy them in their temporal intere&s;t, but <HI>the&s;e</HI> wound them deeply in tem|poral and eternal at the &s;ame time; ina&s;much as if we practi&s;ed the go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and lived by the faith of the Son of GOD, it could not fail of engaging the arm of Omnipotence in the defence of both: Then, having our anchor within the veil, we might ju&s;tly triumph with tho&s;e worthy heroes of old, who, thro' <HI>faith, &s;ubdued kingdoms, wrought righteou&s;ne&s;s, obtained promi&s;es, &s;topped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, e&s;caped the edge of the &s;word; out of weakne&s;s were made &s;trong, waxed valiant in fight, and turned to &s;light the army of the aliens.</HI> Whereas, on the contrary, a di&s;&s;olute debauch|ed, prophase life, a land full of infidelity, mu&s;t cau&s;e the divine Maje&s;ty of heaven to ri&s;e up again&s;t them.</P>
<P>I &s;hould &s;well my letter to too great a length, &s;hould I pur&s;ue my inclination on this &s;ubject: But what I have &s;aid, I hope, through the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of divine grace, will excite your de&s;ires and
<PB N="22" REF="012778_0021_0F8A933E8BFFF5E0">diligence to become acquainted, <HI>experimentally acquainted,</HI> with the doctrines of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Oh <HI>Hayton!</HI> did you but know the joy of believing in JESUS CHRIST, and the heaven I enjoy in communion with him, it would &s;oon wean you from your &s;uper&s;titious and fruitle&s;s pilgrimage to <HI>Mecca</HI> and <HI>Ara<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ata</HI> in honor of a grand Impo&s;tor; and engage you to come and <HI>&s;ee the &s;alvation of God.</HI></P>
<P>If it plea&s;e the REDEEMER to breathe on the&s;e lines, this humble attempt to inform your judgment, and awaken your con&s;cience, &s;o that they are brought with conviction to your heart, I &s;hall, (if the LORD plea&s;e) &s;end you another letter, to give you a brief account of the doct|rines, practi&s;e, and di&s;cipline; the officers, members, glory and &s;ymetry of a church of CHRIST, according to the Bible plan.</P>
<P>Farewel, my dear friend. May the contem|ned <HI>Nazarene</HI> bring thee to a knowlege of thy|&s;elf, and a knowlege of his pardoning love, which is eternal life!</P>
<P>Then you will not envy our <HI>great Sultan</HI> his glory, but be happy, un&s;peakably happy, in your own brea&s;t.</P>
