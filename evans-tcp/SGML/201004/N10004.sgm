<HEAD>II KINGS II. 12. &mdash;<HI>My Father, my Father, the Chariot of I&s;rael and the Hor&s;emen thereof.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS was the cry of <HI>Eli&s;ha,</HI> when <HI>Elijah</HI> was taken from him. Though he mu&s;t have the greate&s;t a&s;&s;urance po&s;&s;ible of his going to a &s;tate of re&s;t and peace; yet he felt the greate&s;t concern for him&s;elf and his people, under the &s;en&s;e of &s;o great a lo&s;s; and therefore under this deep &s;en&s;e and concern, he cries out as in our text, <HI>My father, my father,</HI> &amp;c. as if it were po&s;&s;ible to call him back to them again, that the nation might have and enjoy the great benefit of &s;uch an eminent man &s;till longer. We have the like expre&s;&s;ion of the king of I&s;rael to this &s;ame prophet, who uttered the&s;e words of our text, when he came to &s;ee him in his la&s;t &s;ick|ne&s;s. This king, though he was a wicked man, yet it &s;eems he had &s;o much &s;en&s;e and knowledge of the great &s;afeguard &s;o good a man was to his people; as to make him cry with this affecting cry, of words like our text; expre&s;&s;ive of a deep &s;en&s;e of &s;u&s;taining, or being about to &s;u&s;tain, a lo&s;s &s;o great as even all the military force and de|fence of the people. The calling any one father is a mo&s;t engaging appellation: becau&s;e a father is one on whom the child depends for help, &s;up|port
<PB N="4" REF="012713_0004_0F8B8D848241F120">and defence. And the natural di&s;po&s;ition in a father to grant help to a child, or attend to his cry, makes it the more important.</P>
<P>Again, what makes the text more important is the doubling the call, <HI>My father, my father;</HI> which implies earne&s;tne&s;s, as though every breath was engaged. <HI>The chariot of I&s;rael and the hor&s;e|men thereof,</HI> are put in appo&s;ition with <HI>father:</HI> and the words no doubt are de&s;igned to carry this &s;en&s;e or idea; as if he had &s;aid, My father thou art the chariot of I&s;rael: Thou art our &s;afeguard. Or as if he he had &s;aid, By lo&s;ing thee, we lo&s;e all the defen&s;ive force of the Nation. For again he &s;ays, <HI>My father, the hor&s;emen of I&s;rael.</HI> As if he had &s;aid, If you leave us we &s;hall be left na|ked of chariots and hor&s;emen; or as defencele&s;s as a people that have none; and oh how &s;ad will our ca&s;e be, when it is come to this, and we have &s;o many enemies &s;urrounding us, and &s;eeking our de|&s;truction. O father, what &s;hall we then do? O if you might but be continued with us! But now we are left defencele&s;s.</P>
<P>By <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI>'s calling <HI>Elijah</HI> father, we are not to under&s;tand that he was his natural father, or indeed of any near kindred: but it is ob&s;ervably very com|mon in &s;cripture, for tho&s;e in public &s;tations, to be addre&s;&s;ed or &s;poken of in that manner; e&s;pecially tho&s;e that well filled their places for the good of the people. As a father at the head of a fa|mily takes care of, guides, in&s;tructs and provides for his family; &s;o a good king or ruler, or prie&s;t, or prophet, very ju&s;tly bears the title of a father to the people they &s;tand in public relation to. Thus in our text: Thus in what the king of I&s;rael &s;aid to <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI> when on his death-bed; and al&s;o when he a&s;ked him if he &s;hould &s;mite the Syrians,
<PB N="5" REF="012713_0005_0F8B8D8542677E68">2 Kings 6.21. So <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> is &s;aid to be made a father to <HI>Pharaoh.</HI> So al&s;o, Father is u&s;ed for tho&s;e of the &s;ame &s;tation or profe&s;&s;ion, who are advanced in years, as in our text. And hence the young prophets are called the &s;ons of the prophets. In all the&s;e &s;en&s;es the word father is u&s;ed in our text, as to age, &s;tation, and well filling a public place or character. And in all the&s;e we may u&s;e it in the ca&s;e before us.</P>
<P>In treating upon this &s;ubject, we may attend to the following things, for illu&s;tration and im|provement.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>We may ob&s;erve from the words, that the godly, e&s;pecially when in a public &s;tation, are a great advantage and defence, as fathers to the people where they are.</HI>  <GAP DESC="blank">  Therefore,</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>When &s;uch are taken away, it is ju&s;t matter of very deep &s;orrow and lamentation to the people where they have lived.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t then we are to attend to the illu&s;tration of the ob&s;ervation, <HI>That the godly, e&s;pecially when in a public &s;tation, are a great advantage and de|fence, as fathers to the people where they are.</HI></P>
<P>Our text, as well as the other text hinted, &s;ets them forth to be not only as fathers, but as a de|fence, as really as chariots and hor&s;emen: yea, that but one eminently good man for &s;afeguard, might be accounted to be as all the martial force of the nation. We accordingly find that God &s;et forth his re&s;pect to good men in this light. Thus he &s;pared the old world for a &s;ea&s;on, for the &s;ake of &s;ome few good men; of whom we may reck|on <HI>Methu&s;elah</HI> as well as <HI>Noah.</HI> The flood was &s;tayed, and nothing could be done, till one was in his grave, and the other in the ark. That &s;elf &s;ame day that <HI>Noah</HI> entered into the ark, the
<PB N="6" REF="012713_0006_0F8B8D876D7F2BC8">fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened. As &s;oon as all good men were out of the way; de|&s;truction did not wait upon the people one day. In like manner we find, when <HI>Sodom</HI> was de&s;troy|ed, the angel &s;aid he could do nothing, till <HI>Lot</HI> was out of the way: but, as &s;oon as he was gone, not a moment delay before the dreadful &s;torm of God's wrath was poured down upon them.</P>
<P>To the &s;ame purpo&s;e we find through the whole of God's dealings with the children of I&s;rael. While they &s;erved the Lord and walked in his ways, things went well with them. Thus in the days of <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> and the elders that out lived him, there was no one able to &s;tand before them. But, as &s;oon as all the&s;e good men were dead, they did evil in the &s;ight of the Lord, and he &s;old them into the hand of &s;poilers that &s;poiled them. Judges II. 14. So, through the whole &s;tate of the I&s;raelites, when they had a good king it went well with them. Thus in the days of <HI>Jo|&s;iah,</HI> God &s;pared them from the de&s;truction he had threatned them for the &s;ins of <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh</HI> till after the death of <HI>Jo&s;iah.</HI> But, as &s;oon as he was gone, breaches were made upon them one after another, till they were de&s;troyed, and as it is expre&s;&s;ed ca&s;t out of his &s;ight. The world indeed &s;tands for the &s;ake of the elect. So it is expre&s;&s;ed in the Revelation, tho&s;e angels, that were appointed to de&s;troy, were not permitted to hurt, till the elect were made &s;afe.</P>
<P>God knows how to &s;ave them, that are his own, however the world may be involved in wicked|ne&s;s; yet will withhold the letting forth his wrath and fury upon the ungodly, &s;o long as it is for the good and &s;afety of his cho&s;en; &s;o that they are a
<PB N="7" REF="012713_0007_0F8B8D8794A00F50">&s;pecial &s;afeguard and defence to all about them, that have any &s;pecial connection with them.&mdash; Thus it may with the &s;tricte&s;t truth be affirmed, that the pious and godly are not only as fathers; but a great and &s;pecial defence to the people where they dwell.</P>
<P>We may now attend to &s;ome particulars &s;hew|ing, wherein they are &s;uch a &s;afety and defence to their people.</P>
<P N="1">1. They are a &s;afeguard to the people where they dwell by their good examples and per&s;ua&s;i|ons, which have a great and con&s;training force with them to keep in awe the vicious, and to pre|vent their out breakings of &s;in. Indeed many times vice gets &s;o much the a&s;cendence, that little regard or reverence is paid to the examples of the pious and godly, or even to their advice and per|&s;ua&s;ions. But when this is the ca&s;e, it is a &s;ign and evidence, that de&s;truction is at the door. When the godly have lo&s;t all their influence upon tho&s;e about them, 'tis a &s;ign and evidence that their work is ju&s;t done; and, when that is done, they will be taken to God him&s;elf, and de&s;truction will &s;peedily come upon tho&s;e about them. Thus was the ca&s;e of <HI>Lot;</HI> we find, ju&s;t before the de&s;tructi|on of <HI>Sodom,</HI> he had lo&s;t all his influence, and all he could &s;ay to them, met with no better than in|&s;ult. When he e&s;&s;ayed to di&s;wade them from that dreadful wickedne&s;s they were for doing to the angels, they &s;ay, This one fellow came in to &s;ojourn, and he will needs be a judge; and go on to threaten and pre&s;s upon him to abu&s;e him; yea and when he went as a father to his &s;ons in law, to forewarn them of their danger, they treated him with the utmo&s;t neglect; all which was the mo&s;t immediate forerunner of that awful de&s;truction.
<PB N="8" REF="012713_0008_0F8B8D88D2DE3340">The &s;ame al&s;o appears from what we read of the old man and the Levite, Judg. 19.22 and on|ward. The mo&s;t gentle per&s;wa&s;ives and entrea|ties had no effect upon tho&s;e that be&s;et the hou&s;e, which appears to be the cau&s;e of dreadful de&s;olati|on as to the tribe they belonged to. Thus we may &s;ee, that when the godly have lo&s;t their influ|ence, and neither their examples nor per&s;ua&s;ions will avail, it is a leading to de&s;truction, from which we may &s;ee, how or wherein they are a de|fence by their good examples.</P>
<P N="2">2. They are not only a &s;afeguard and defence by their examples and per&s;wa&s;ions, but by their advice, exhortations and coun&s;els, to reclaim the ungodly, and to keep them from running to &s;o great lengths in their Sin. And not only &s;o, but by their coun&s;el and direction, how to conduct, they are a great advantage and defence; for God guideth the ju&s;t; he ordereth their goings aright; he keepeth them in their way, &s;o that their feet do not &s;tumble; and, when a people have &s;uch among them, and will adhere to their advice, it makes their way &s;afe. Such pious godly men, who have their dependance upon God, he will never leave nor for&s;ake. Thus, while <HI>Jehoiada</HI> lived, and <HI>Jo|a&s;h</HI> followed his advice, he reigned well, and things pro&s;pered among them: but, after the death of <HI>Jehoiada,</HI> the king for&s;ook the Lord, and it was but a little while before things began to decline, and in about the cour&s;e of a year the ho&s;t of <HI>Syria</HI> came again&s;t him, and de&s;troyed all the princes of the people: For the army of the <HI>Syrians</HI> came with a &s;mall company of men, and the Lord delivered into their hand a very great ho&s;t, becau&s;e they had for&s;aken the Lord God of their fathers; &s;o they executed judgment again&s;t <HI>Joa&s;h;</HI> &s;ee 2 Chron.
<PB N="9" REF="012713_0009_0F8B8D8955BF0440">24.23, &amp;c. There we &s;ee, how that the good in&s;truction and coun&s;el of <HI>Jeboiada</HI> was an advan|tage and defence, and that as a father he guided and guarded the people, while he continued a|mong them. Thus al&s;o we may reckon under this particular, that the godly are as fathers and a &s;afeguard to their people by their prudence and wi&s;dom, in advi&s;ing and ordering affairs; for to &s;uch God giveth di&s;cretion. So a prudent woman once &s;aved a city by her wi&s;dom. When God de&s;igns good for a people, he rai&s;es up &s;ome with wi&s;dom and prudence to lead and to guide them: but when a people are become &s;o bad, that God determines evil for them, then he hides coun&s;el from the wi&s;e, and under&s;tanding from the pru|dent; or takes away the prudent from among them. It is not a <HI>meer political &s;agacity,</HI> that can guard and defend a people: but it mu&s;t be a <HI>pious godly prudence,</HI> which is founded in a dependance, &s;hel|tering; &s;o that here we may &s;ee how that the godly are a &s;afeguard to the people where they are.</P>
<P N="3">3. They are as fathers and a &s;pecial &s;afeguard and defence to the people where they are, by their fervent prayers and frequent &s;upplications to God for their people. The effectual fervent prayer of the righteous availeth much; accordingly we find that the earne&s;t and fervent prayers of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> were from time to time attended with the &s;alvation of the children of I&s;rael from immediate de&s;tructi|on. How often God threatned to de&s;troy them in a moment, and, <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> interpo&s;ing with his ear|ne&s;t prayers and &s;upplications, God turned from the fiercene&s;s of his anger, and would not de&s;troy them. The &s;ame may be ob&s;erved of the
<PB N="10" REF="012713_0010_0F8B8D8B811FB070">prayer of <HI>Hezekiah</HI> and <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> again&s;t the A&s;&s;yri|an army, and of <HI>Samuel</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Phili&s;tines,</HI> in both which they did more than all the chariots and hor&s;emen of I&s;rael could do: and many other in&s;tances to the &s;ame purpo&s;e may be found re|corded in &s;acred writ; all which &s;hews the &s;afe|guard the godly are by their prayers, more than all the chariots of I&s;rael and the hor&s;emen thereof.</P>
<P N="4">4. The godly are a &s;afeguard to their people by their tru&s;ting in God. When a per&s;on tru&s;ts in God, nothing can hurt him; for <HI>The name of the Lord is a &s;trong Tower; the righteous runneth into it and is &s;afe,</HI> Prov. 18.10. To the &s;ame purpo&s;e al&s;o we read that <HI>The hor&s;e is prepared a|gain&s;t the day of battle: but &s;afety is of the Lord,</HI> Prov. 21.31. The greate&s;t and mo&s;t terrible armies in array are of no avail, unle&s;s the Lord go forth with them. The prayers of a few godly men, who put their tru&s;t in the Lord, can bla&s;t and de&s;troy the greate&s;t armies, as appears in the ca&s;e of <HI>Hezekiah</HI> above hinted, and many other places that might be mentioned. There is no &s;afety, where there is no tru&s;t in God, and no dan|ger where there is a gracious tru&s;t in him; for &s;uch were never confounded or put to &s;hame. So that herein they are a &s;pecial &s;afeguard and defence, &s;o long as people will hearken to them. But, as be|fore ob&s;erved, when they have lo&s;t their influence, and their work is thus come to a clo&s;e, God &s;oon takes away, removes them to &s;ome other place upon this earth, or takes them home to him&s;elf in his heavenly kingdom.</P>
<P N="5">5. Once more&mdash;The truly pious are an advan|tage and defence, as fathers where they are, by their being public &s;pirited; for there are none more public &s;pirited than &s;uch; for they have a
<PB N="11" REF="012713_0011_0F8B8D8C0554F5B0">real and &s;incere love, tenderne&s;s, and benevolence toward all mankind: as fathers they delight to do good unto others; for they are the children of their father in heaven, who cau&s;es his &s;un to ri&s;e, and his rain to de&s;cend on the ju&s;t and on the unju&s;t, on the evil and the good: and thus they practice that, which has the &s;tronge&s;t force to a&s;&s;i|milate and unite all together, and &s;o to &s;trength|en the whole body; which alone is that &s;afeguard that can keep every body from de&s;truction, and without which, as our Saviour &s;ays, hou&s;es and kingdoms cannot &s;tand.</P>
<P>Thus we have con&s;idered &s;ome particulars, &s;hewing, wherein the godly are a &s;afeguard and defence as fathers to their people. We now pro|ceed to our &s;econd general head propo&s;ed, viz.</P>
<P N="2">II. To con&s;ider that, <HI>when &s;uch are taken a|way, it is ju&s;t matter of very deep &s;orrow and lam|entation to the people where they have lived.</HI></P>
<P>Although it is <HI>much better</HI> for &s;uch godly per|&s;ons to be gone, and to be with Chri&s;t, than to be here in the body; yea great <HI>gain,</HI> becau&s;e of the many troubles they have to meet with in this world. Though it is better for them&s;elves to be gone; yet, for tho&s;e where they have lived, it would be better, if they might be continued among them. To this effect the apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> &s;peaks, Philip. 1.23, 24. The godly are &s;o great a protection to the people where they are, as we have above con|&s;idered, that it is a very great lo&s;s for them to be taken away. In the illu&s;tration of this head, we may fir&s;t take notice of &s;ome in&s;tances of mourn|ing recorded in &s;cripture when the pious and god|ly were taken away.</P>
<P>In general it is remarked in &s;cripture, that when any man of public note was taken away, if it was
<PB N="12" REF="012713_0012_0F8B8D8E1DDBC898">a pious and godly man, there was great mourning for him; but if it was a wicked man, there was little or no mourning for him. Thus when good old <HI>Jacob</HI> died, there was great mourning and lamentation for him; even the Egyptians were &s;o &s;en&s;ible what a great lo&s;s it was, that they mourn|ed with a very grievous cry. So al&s;o when <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was taken away, all I&s;rael mourned for him. He had long been their guide, their mediator; led, guided, guarded, fed, in&s;tructed them as their fa|ther, and had been their law-giver; a man of &s;o great u&s;efulne&s;s, that they had indeed very great rea&s;on to lament the lo&s;s of him. So al&s;o we find, through the account of the kings of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> when a good king was taken away, there was &s;pecial men|tion of the people's mourning for him. Many in&s;tances of this kind are to be found in &s;acred writ: But we &s;hall proceed to ob&s;erve &s;ome rea|&s;ons, &s;hewing, why it is &s;uch ju&s;t matter of mourn|ing when the godly are taken away.</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e the people are &s;tripped of their fa|thers, their force, their guard; the chariots and hor&s;emen of the people are gone; they are as a town invironed with enemies, and all their martial force removed, left naked to the inroads of their enemies, and nothing to look for, but that they &s;hall &s;oon be cut off, and made a de&s;olation, unle&s;s God rai&s;es up &s;ome to &s;ucceed, who &s;hall fill up their place. But when God takes away the faith|ful of the earth, the Inhabitants thereof have great rea&s;on to look upon it as a te&s;timony that God is angry with them: which is mo&s;t ju&s;t cau&s;e of mourning, that we have thus provoked him to anger, and to threaten to de&s;troy us; and it is a loud call to a people to pro&s;trate them&s;elves in deep mourning for their &s;ins; yea, with deep &s;orrow
<PB N="13" REF="012713_0013_0F8B8D8E43622A48">and repentance with unfeigned grief; that we have provoked him to &s;trip us of &s;uch pillars of our welfare.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is ju&s;t cau&s;e of mourning, becau&s;e we are now deprived of their good examples. Albeit we may and ought to bear their examples in our minds, &s;o that, after they are dead, they may yet &s;o far &s;peak to us in their good deeds, and be &s;till an advantage to us after they are gone from us. And thus we &s;hould, at their departure, bear in our minds a deep &s;en&s;e of their importance, that we may the longer retain the advantage of their ex|amples, and the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of their memory.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another thing contained in the lo&s;s a people &s;u&s;tain at the departure of a godly man, and makes it ju&s;t cau&s;e of mourning, is the lo&s;s of their fervent prayers. Such bear upon their hearts before God all, that they &s;tand nearly related to; like <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Job. Mo&s;es</HI> when any thing threatned his people, was importunate with God, till it was averted. <HI>Job</HI> cea&s;ed not every day to offer &s;acrifices for his children. Such as are pious good men wre&s;tle with God for all about them. And, while God keeps up &s;uch pillars among his people, &s;tirring up his &s;ervants to &s;uch fervent prayers, he will an&s;wer them; for he does <HI>not &s;ay to the &s;eed of</HI> JACOB, <HI>&s;eek ye me in vain.</HI> But when he takes away &s;uch from among a people, it is to be feared he is about to withdraw his favor from that people, and what can be a greater cau&s;e of mourning and lamentation? for then <HI>Ichabod</HI> is written upon all their concerns, the glory is de|parted, church and &s;tate are in danger. This &s;urely is cau&s;e of mourning when &s;o many earne&s;t prayers are cea&s;ed from among a people. What a great gap! What a great lo&s;s! How much it
<PB N="14" REF="012713_0014_0F8B8D8F08295EE8">calls for weeping, lamentation, and mourning!</P>
<P>Once more.</P>
<P N="4">4. When the godly are taken away from a|mong a people, it is ju&s;t cau&s;e of mourning to them, that now they have lo&s;t the comfort and benefit of their &s;ociety. Man was made for &s;ociety, and it is ju&s;t cau&s;e of mourning, when a &s;ocial companion is taken away; and e&s;pecially, when it is one, who&s;e company or &s;ociety tended to make us wi&s;e; as the &s;criptures &s;ay, he that walk|eth with the wi&s;e, &s;hall be wi&s;e. But when a wi&s;e companion is taken from us, this is ju&s;t matter of mourning, and will indeed be &s;o to us, if we have any reli&s;h for that wi&s;dom and piety, which grace the lives of the godly; mourning and grief, that we can no more enjoy that fellow&s;hip with them here upon earth. Thus we have con&s;idered &s;ome things, &s;hewing the lo&s;s of the godly is &s;uch great cau&s;e of mourning. We may now attend to &s;ome</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="application">
<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>And now, beloved, may we not with great propriety apply and make improvement of this &s;ubject in the ca&s;e before us? Have we not lo&s;t a pious godly <HI>Father,</HI> a father in age, a father in his being in a public &s;tation, a father in his good examples, a father in giving good advice and exhortations, a father in his fervent prayers, a father in his prudence and wi&s;dom, a father in his tender concern for us, a father in his public &s;pi|ritedne&s;s, a father to his church and people, a father to the poor, a father to his younger bre|thren in the mini&s;try? And thus lo&s;t, a very great in&s;trumental &s;afety, defence, and protection; yea what <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI> in our text does not &s;cruple &s;peak
<PB N="15" REF="012713_0015_0F8B8D91312CA750">of as the whole martial defence of the people; for although <HI>Elijah</HI> &s;tood only in a religious pub|lick relation to <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> yet his life was of that importance to their &s;afety and defence. <HI>David,</HI> when <HI>Abner</HI> was killed, very greatly mourneck, when it was only a chief military man, and one, that had but newly turned to his &s;ide; and he reckons over his being weak and defencele&s;s, and the greatne&s;s of the man lo&s;t, as the cau&s;e and matter of his great mourning: and if that was &s;uch ju&s;t matter of mourning, grief and lamentation; how much more when a father, and all the defen|&s;ive force of the people is removed? Beloved, I claim &s;hare in con&s;idering him as a father, being my&s;elf a younger brother in the &s;tation he &s;u&s;tain|ed; and which has led my mind to the con&s;idera|tion, and applying the words of our text for your contemplation at this time.</P>
<P>And here, as we con&s;idered, that the godly were a &s;afeguard by their good examples, &s;o it may be to our purpo&s;e, to take a &s;hort view of the character of our kind and honoured father, who is taken away from us; praying, that, by thus viewing him, when he is taken from us, a double portion of his &s;pirit may re&s;t upon us, as it was promi&s;ed <HI>Eli&s;ha,</HI> it &s;hould be unto him, if he &s;aw <HI>Elijah</HI> taken from him. And e&s;pecially, as he was in a public relation, and as a father both in age and &s;tation, we may with propriety look into his character, and hold it up for our imitation, as well as for our mourning on account of the lo&s;s of him.</P>
<P N="1">1. We &s;hall take notice of one thing &s;pecially, that did not belong to his character, viz. <HI>O&s;tenta|tion,</HI> or affecting to make a great &s;hew in the world, of &s;cholar&s;hip, or of importance, in polemick points or di&s;putes. He was very far from &s;hewing
<PB N="16" REF="012713_0016_0F8B8D9156570650">him&s;elf forward in any controver&s;ies; though he was by tho&s;e, who were intimately acquainted with him, accounted an accurate &s;cholar; and all he undertook, to effect it with great care and exact|ne&s;s: not a&s;piring after that more public ap|pearance, or an affectatious o&s;tentation: or as a blazing &s;tar, that makes a great &s;hew, and is &s;o excentric in its orbit, that it is mo&s;tly upon ex|tremes; either very near the &s;un, or at an indeffi|nite di&s;tance from it; &s;ometimes pa&s;&s;ing toward the &s;un with vehement &s;wiftne&s;s, and then again receding with as great vehemency, in directly the rever&s;e cour&s;e from that, in which it but a little be|fore pa&s;&s;ed toward the &s;un. This very curiou&s;ly points forth to us, the ca&s;e of tho&s;e that make a great blaze in the world; and how they go the re|ver&s;e one time of what they went but a little before. Not &s;uch an one was our <HI>Father</HI> taken from us. But he was a regular &s;tar, moving in the orb, in which God had placed him, with uniform lu&s;tre. Nor was he one of the dulle&s;t or ob&s;cure&s;t &s;tars, in re|flecting light from the great <HI>Sun of righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> But it was of &s;uch brightne&s;s, that it &s;hone with con&s;picuous light through the thick clouds that have for &s;ome years pa&s;t obumbrated our nation and land.</P>
<P>The light which he eminently reflected from JESUS CHRIST the SUN OF RIGHTEOUSNESS, may be reckoned in a few particulars. 1. Pure and unfeigned love. The benevolence and com|pa&s;&s;ion of a father, the kindne&s;s of a brother, the faithfulne&s;s of a friend, eminently appeared in him. His paternal compa&s;&s;ion, no doubt every one of you can witne&s;s to, and e&s;pecially the poor, which you have always with you; who have, I &s;uppo&s;e,
<PB N="17" REF="012713_0017_0F8B8D922EDDB610">been many times fed, warmed, and relieved by his charitable bounty. His brotherly kindne&s;s has been abundantly felt by his brethren in the mini&s;|try, as I my&s;elf am witne&s;s; as well as al&s;o his fi|delity as a friend.</P>
<P>In his mo&s;t public exerci&s;es or performances at ordination &s;olemnities, where it very frequently fell to his &s;hare to give the <HI>right hand of fellow&s;hip;</HI> a part which afforded him very ample occa&s;ion for expre&s;&s;ing this noble affection; he was not wanting in &s;hewing a mo&s;t eminent degree of bro|therly love and cordial affection toward his bre|thren in the mini&s;try, and the churches of God. I believe all, who have had the opportunity of at|tending upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, can witne&s;s, how great he was in &s;hewing this Chri&s;t-like affection. No le&s;s con&s;picuous did his light &s;hine in this de|&s;irable affection, wherever he was called to have any concern in divi&s;ions and difficulties in chur|ches, wherein he always appeared to have a &s;ingu|lar regard for the truth; as well as love and com|pa&s;&s;ion for tho&s;e that were borne upon. And in &s;uch affairs he did not put on two faces, and &s;ide with them that were next him; but &s;teadily ad|hered to the truth and hone&s;ty of the cau&s;e, and always &s;hewed a very compa&s;&s;ionate concern for the good, peace and comfort of the church of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>But you have had abundant opportunity to ob|&s;erve, in his public di&s;cour&s;es, what an uncommon degree of &s;incere love and tender affection appear|ed. Thus it appeared to me in what little oppor|tunity I have had of attending on his public di&s;|pen&s;ations; and I cannot doubt, but it has much more appeared to you, who have for &s;o many years
<PB N="18" REF="012713_0018_0F8B8D92C1D3D988">been favoured with di&s;tillings of divine dew, and gentle rain, from his plea&s;ant voice. No le&s;s ami|able and con&s;picuous, did this divine virtue of pure love and &s;incere friend&s;hip, appear in his more private affairs of life: He &s;hewed a mo&s;t friendly concern for the good, comfort and wel|fare of all, wherever he came; even if he was on|ly a wayfaring man, he was not wanting in &s;hew|ing a very &s;ingular concern for their welfare: &s;o &s;ingular was he for this, that it might I &s;uppo&s;e be &s;aid of him in this, as God &s;aid of <HI>Job,</HI> that there was none like him in all the earth, at lea&s;t none that we know of. Thus he reflected from the divine &s;un an uncommon beam of &s;ingular love; which qualification is the fulfilling of the law: by which he appeared, abundantly endued with that &s;ingular di&s;po&s;ition, of doing as he would be done by; which our Saviour &s;ays is the law and the prophets.  <GAP DESC="blank">  Hence,</P>
<P N="2">2. We may remark another very eminent beam of light he reflected from the <HI>Sun of righ|teou&s;ne&s;s</HI> was his <HI>Hone&s;ty,</HI> in which as to his pri|vate affairs, he had, I &s;uppo&s;e, the good report of all men; but his <HI>hone&s;ty</HI> in public character was mo&s;t important and mo&s;t con&s;picuous; and in this he &s;hone with &s;ingular lu&s;tre. He was mo&s;t friendly in his temper and di&s;po&s;ition, kind and courteous: but yet he had no friend &s;o near and dear to him as <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>hone&s;ty:</HI> he would aban|don any friend, &s;ooner than his con&s;cience, or in he lea&s;t deviate from truth and hone&s;ty, to which he was &s;o clo&s;ely attached, and for which he had &s;o great a veneration; that not even the clofe&s;t friend&s;hip, could bribe him to turn a&s;ide from the truth; &s;uch light did he reflect from the <HI>Sun of righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> that he was a &s;tar of rare magnitude in this noble qualification.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="19" REF="012713_0019_0F8B8D938247E0A8">
3. To &s;um up in a word; the light which he reflected from Chri&s;t the <HI>Sun of righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> he imitated his glorious Ma&s;ter in love, in patience, in doing good, and &s;eeking the good both of the &s;ouls and bodies of men; giving up much of his worldly intere&s;t in his life-time; that by all means he might win &s;ome; and at his death, viz. in his la&s;t will and te&s;tament, having no heirs of his body, he made you the church of Chri&s;t his heir, in &s;uch a manner, as that you &s;hall, from genera|tion to generation forever, feel the effects of his propitious bounty; &s;o that although after he had &s;erved his generation by the will of God, he fell a&s;leep; yet he has made provi&s;ion, whereby you his dear people may forever be fed, by the drop|pings of the &s;anctuary, from the fruits of his la|bours. Thus his life and his death were devoted to the good, the &s;ervice, the well being of the church of Chri&s;t. Thus he lived Chri&s;t, as he held forth in his la&s;t publick labours; and we are in charity bound to believe he is now reaping that <HI>gain,</HI> which in the &s;ame &s;ubject, he held forth there was to &s;uch in <HI>death;</HI> and e&s;pecially al&s;o, as tho&s;e words appeared to be his &s;upport, and the refre&s;hment of his &s;oul, in his la&s;t hours under the apprehen&s;ions of the near approach of death.</P>
<P N="4">4. What de&s;erves to be here reckoned a reflec|tion from Chri&s;t the <HI>Sun of righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and what belongs to the character we are con&s;idering, view|ing him as a <HI>father:</HI> He was a great lover of <HI>li|berty</HI> as a kind benevolent <HI>father:</HI> though in a publick &s;tation; yet he would have all as children free, not as &s;laves; all tyranny, either in church or &s;tate, was an abomination unto him. He was for that true <HI>liberty;</HI> which is, <HI>liberty</HI> without licentiou&s;|ne&s;s;
<PB N="20" REF="012713_0020_0F8B8D944AB0F428">that <HI>liberty</HI> to which we are called, which is a <HI>liberty</HI> to do good, not to do hurt; not <HI>liberty</HI> for a cloak of maliciou&s;ne&s;s; but <HI>in love to &s;erve one another,</HI> as it is expre&s;&s;ed Gal. 5.13. He did not appear to have any inclination to have any <HI>liberty</HI> to him&s;elf, but what he was &s;incerely willing o|thers &s;hould enjoy the &s;ame in common with him. So generous a &s;oul had he, that it was not enough for him to enjoy freedom alone; but he appeared to have a &s;pecial happine&s;s and &s;atisfaction in others enjoying the &s;ame he did him&s;elf. The freedom and order of our civil and religious con&s;titution, was very greatly at heart with him.</P>
<P>To &s;ay in a word, and to conclude the character of our departed friend; he was one, that many of the beatitudes may with &s;trictne&s;s and propriety be predicated of, Meek, merciful, a peace-maker, of whom it is declared, by him that has the di&s;po&s;al of all things, that &s;uch &s;hall <HI>inherit the earth, ob|tain mercy,</HI> and be called the children of God. Thus we have attended to &s;ome imperfect hints of the character of him who was dear to us: and therein have viewed our father when he is taken away from us; we &s;hould be careful that we &s;ted|fa&s;tly behold him in his examples, wherein he followed Chri&s;t, that &s;o we may obtain a double portion of his &s;pirit. We may now attend to &s;ome particular addre&s;s to the mourners. And fir&s;t to her, who has received the deepe&s;t wound by this fore &s;troke of divine providence, the &s;orrowful widow. We heartily condole you, when we enter that hou&s;e, where we u&s;ed to find our fa|ther, our friend, our dear brother and companion: what heavine&s;s and grief does it work in us that there we &s;ee him no more! And how much more
<PB N="21" REF="012713_0021_0F8B8D9501914A78">this mu&s;t con&s;tantly attend you, we can faintly imagin, though not fully conceive! We know he was mo&s;t near to you; when he &s;u&s;tained, not only all the relations to you ward, that he did to us: but that mo&s;t near relation of a kind hu&s;band; the de&s;ire of your eyes, the companion and part|ner of all your joys; as well as &s;u&s;tained your griefs and burdens. But now you are left alone to bear a manifold burden of grief; and we would wil|lingly take a part of your grief, and bear it for you. But this we grieve, that it is out of our power: ca&s;t thy burdens upon the Lord and he &s;hall &s;u&s;tain them: you mu&s;t &s;eek to God for com|fort and con&s;olation, and put your tru&s;t in him, who is the God and hu&s;band of the widow, and &s;eek for all your con&s;olation there; and may God grant you all comfort and happine&s;s, that is mo&s;t proper for you while here; and bring you at la&s;t to the full fruition of him&s;elf, in the world to come.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now addre&s;s my&s;elf to the beloved church and congregation of this place.&mdash;You, beloved, I tru&s;t are more &s;en&s;ible what a great lo&s;s you have &s;u&s;tained, than I can de&s;cribe to you in words. As a faithful and prudent pa&s;tor, he was mo&s;t near to you; as a kind father and un|di&s;&s;embled friend, I claim a &s;hare with you: here &s;hould be our comfort, that when father, and even were it a mother too for&s;ake us, the Lord will take us up, if we tru&s;t in him. P&s;al. 27.10. This &s;hould be our hope, that although our <HI>father,</HI> and the chariots and hor&s;men of I&s;rael, are re|moved from us; yet God is a father to them that put their tru&s;t in him; and he is the Lord of ho&s;ts; he is the &s;hepherd of his people; and if he brings
<PB N="22" REF="012713_0022_0F8B8D9655F85FD8">us nearer to him, and a more filial dependence up|on him, then it will do us good; and as our dear friend we hope is a gainer by death, &s;o we &s;hall be gainers by it too. But we feel &s;uch a lo&s;s, that tho' for him to depart and be with Chri&s;t is better for him; yet for us (it &s;eems) it would have been much better, if he might have abode with us. And therefore we can't but cry out with <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI> in our text, <HI>My father, my father, the chariot of I&s;rael and the hor&s;emen thereof.</HI> What a great lo&s;s is here; to lo&s;e &s;uch a &s;tind father, and the defen&s;ive force of the people!</P>
<P>Beloved, let us take up the mantle of his faith and good examples which he has left us; and &s;o wear it, as that we may appear to be in very deed his &s;ons in all things, wherein he followed Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and as a noble &s;tar reflected light from the <HI>Sun of righteou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> and carry it with us to the <HI>Jor|dan</HI> of death, to &s;mite the waters thereof, hither, and thither, that we may pa&s;s over without any harm or fear of evil.</P>
<P>And my earne&s;t prayer is, that you may find an <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI> to &s;ucceed, that &s;hall behold your a&s;cended father <HI>Elijah;</HI> and wearing his mantle of paternal bounty, as well as of faith and good examples, may lead you by the hand, and ever maintain in you a filial affection toward him, who&s;e memory de&s;erves forever to be precious with you even from generation to generation.</P>
<P>And, that you may be led and conducted to &s;uch an one, accept a few hints of advice from one, who &s;incerely wi&s;hes your welfare, and ear|ne&s;tly prays, that in due time you may have one, that &s;hall fill up the place of your dear decea&s;ed pa&s;tor.</P>

We do not mourn for him, &s;o long as we tru&s;t he is a gainer by the change; &s;ince he now re&s;ts from his labours, and his works do follow him: he has changed a world of trouble, perplexity and grief for an eternal fix|ed &s;tate of (we charitably hope) re&s;t, joy and hap|pine&s;s; where all &s;orrow and &s;ighing are fled a|way; where faith is &s;wallowed up in vi&s;ion; and hope in fruition; where there is the full enjoy|ment of God and Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Thus we hope our departed friend is triumphing in the realms of uninterrupted bli&s;s and and happine&s;s; and it remains for us to mourn, that we have lo&s;t &s;uch a father, &s;uch a friend, &s;uch a dear companion; to bewail the &s;infulne&s;s of our &s;tate, whereby death has taken place and none are &s;uffered to continue by rea&s;on thereof.

This leads to confu&s;ion; but move &s;teadily in the orb, and motion God has allotted out for us; &s;tudy what is duty, what is the mind and will of God, what he points out for us to do, by his word and by his providences; and attend con&s;cienciou&s;ly thereto. This is the way to honor God, and to have the comfortable evi|dences of being accepted of him; for them that honor him he will honor. In vain is it to a&s;pire after great things, and things out of our &s;phere; it will be of no avail to have it to brag of at la&s;t, that we have ca&s;t out devils in Chri&s;t's name; and in his name done many wonderful works, if there be not charity, love and a con&s;ciencious regard to the honor of God, a tender fellow-feeling toward the flock of Chri&s;t, the children of God, the mem|bers of Chri&s;t's body, all will be in vain. Thus we &s;hould walk, with a &s;teady per&s;everance in duty, minding tho&s;e things which have a tendency to do good. Our father which we have now lo&s;t, maintained a &s;teady cour&s;e in doing good, in love, meekne&s;s and hone&s;ty. If all would do &s;o; move regularly in their &s;pheres; what a different face would there be upon things? How happy might the world be to what it is now: &s;urely all conten|tion and jarring mu&s;t cea&s;e; all would be love and harmony. But it mu&s;t needs be that offences come; yet wo to that man by whom they come; while ble&s;&s;ed are the peace makers; for they &s;hall be called the children of God. And tho&s;e, that heartily love and delight in peace and truth here,
<PB N="27" REF="012713_0027_0F8B8D9BDC96E0D0">have a happy encouragement of enjoying of it to all eternity. But what can the unju&s;t, the di&s;ho|ne&s;t, the malicious, the haughty do in heaven? There will be no room for the exerci&s;ing their ungodly tempers there.</P>
<P>Hence all &s;hould be exhorted to live and be|have &s;o here, as the heavenly inhabitants do. And how great a thing that would be, to live as they do in heaven! In love, uprightne&s;s and godly &s;incerity.</P>
<P>Finally, at lea&s;t one more con&s;ideration demands our notice at this time; for when great and im|portant pillars are taken away, the whole build|ing trembles, and is expo&s;ed to tumble to ruin.</P>
<P>Surely the removal of &s;o great a pillar is fore|boding of the vengeance of God being poured out upon us; when the righteous and the merciful man is taken from the evil to come, I&s;a. 57.1. 2.</P>
<P>Thus, in the old world, no &s;ooner was <HI>Methu&s;e|lab</HI> gone than the deluge &s;wept away the ungod|ly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">. Thus no &s;ooner had <HI>Lot</HI> left <HI>So|dom;</HI> but they were de&s;troyed by fire and brim|&s;tone. No &s;ooner was <HI>Jo&s;iah</HI> &s;ecured in his grave; but the captivity began, which fini&s;hed the Jewi&s;h &s;tate. O then let us con&s;ider, how &s;hall the&s;e threatning a&s;pects be averted? but by an effec|tual turning unto God, and becoming &s;tedfa&s;t in tho&s;e things, wherein our friend and father was eminent, lovely and excellent. Beloved, let all the&s;e con&s;iderations awaken us. Let the &s;en&s;e of our great lo&s;s, make a great impre&s;&s;ion on our
<PB N="28" REF="012713_0028_0F8B8D9CAB4DE830">hearts, a great change in our conduct, and &s;o a great alteration in the face of things. And may God of his infinite mercy help, now the godly man cea&s;eth, and the faithful fail from among the children of men.</P>
