<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I began the following Poem, my in|tention was only to commemorate (for my own private &s;atisfaction) the different &s;cenes and places which I beheld in my travels through America; but, after fini&s;hing it, I began to think it might be entertaining to the public; and at the reque&s;t of &s;ome gentlemen to whom I have &s;hewn the manu&s;cript, have agreed to publi&s;h it. With re&s;pect to the poem in general, I &s;hall on|ly inform the reader, that I have frequently u&s;ed the <HI>pre&s;ent ten&s;e</HI> in&s;tead of the <HI>pa&s;t,</HI> in order to keep the action the more alive. The ver&s;es in|troduced into the latter end of the poem, and the &s;eparate pieces added to it, were in&s;erted in hopes of rendering the whole the more entertaining.</P>

<HEAD>Travels Through America.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>MY native home, and dear companions all,</L>
<L>Juvenile plea&s;ures and the ev'ning ball,</L>
<L>The prancing &s;teed, and the quick-&s;centing hound,</L>
<L>I bade adieu, and thus began my round.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From fair Hibernia's healthy, verdant plain,</L>
<L>With Captain Stone, I ru&s;h'd into the main.</L>
<L>At th' age of &s;eventeen and nine months more,</L>
<L>I bade adieu unto my native &s;hore.</L>
<L>I &s;oon beheld the lofty billows roll,</L>
<L>And light'ning fla&s;h, while thunder &s;hook the pole;</L>
<L>Our ve&s;&s;el to&s;&s;ed thro' the &s;tormy main;</L>
<L>Then oft I wi&s;h'd to be at home again.</L>
<L>Alas! how vain my fruitle&s;s wi&s;hes were,</L>
<L>'Mid&s;t &s;eas of trouble, far from parent's care;</L>
<L>Where thunders cla&s;h'd, and &s;eas roll'd mountain high,</L>
<L>Which made me <HI>heave</HI> 'till I thought I &s;hould die.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now <HI>Aeolus</HI> cea&s;es&mdash;<HI>Neptune</HI> rules alone&mdash;</L>
<L>The &s;ky is clear&mdash;the &s;ea is all in foam;</L>

<L>Boreas &s;huts his magazine of &s;torms;</L>
<L>The gla&s;s goes round, and we &s;ing <HI>Wars-alarms.</HI></L>
<L>Thus pa&s;s'd the time for half a day or more,</L>
<L>'Till, loud on deck, we heard the trumpet roar,</L>
<L>'<HI>All hands aloft&mdash;loo&s;en every &s;ail'</HI></L>
<L>The wind then blowing a delightful gale.</L>
<L>All-hands aro&s;e and lent a willing hand;</L>
<L>And now we &s;teer, due-we&s;t, for Newfoundland.</L>
<L>Six weeks elap&s;ed, ere we reach'd the Banks,</L>
<L>Where the rude &s;ailors &s;hew their active pranks.</L>
<L>Here each young&s;ter had to pay a fine,</L>
<L>As &s;eamen do when fir&s;t they cro&s;s the Line:</L>
<L>A ra&s;tic youth who did not &s;oon agree</L>
<L>To pay his bottle, was immediately</L>
<L>To the yard-arm hois'd, with rapid motion;</L>
<L>Thence headlong plung'd down into the ocean!</L>
<L>Thus pa&s;s'd the time, while we were on the banks;</L>
<L>The young&s;ters &s;uffer'd by the &s;ailor's pranks,</L>
<L>'Till from ma&s;t-head, we heard one loudly call,</L>

<L>That &s;uch huge ve&s;&s;els never cro&s;s'd the &s;ea!</L>
<L><HI>"I&s;lands of Ice"</HI> the Captain loudly cries:</L>

<LG>
<L>Seven long weeks (I thought them full a &s;core)</L>
<L>We plow'd the deep before we came on &s;hore.</L>

<L>But the cold winters cau&s;e many to die:</L>

<L>And if you travel Carolina round,</L>
<L>Where wealth and luxury &s;o much abound,</L>
<L>A ro&s;y cheek is &s;carcely to be found!</L>
<L>But yet the fair po&s;&s;e&s;s tho&s;e other charms,</L>
<L>Which plea&s;e the lover and his bo&s;om warms;</L>
<L>A graceful marriage and genteel attire;</L>
<L>A mode&s;t mien that &s;ets his &s;oul on fire;</L>
<L>Accompli&s;h'd manners and education,</L>
