<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>A LITERARY friend, who&s;e opinion I greatly value, &s;ugge&s;ted to me the po&s;&s;i|bility of producing a few little volumes, that might prove as attractive as the mo&s;t romantic fiction, and yet convey all the &s;olid in&s;truction of genuine hi&s;tory. He affirmed, that the voluminous and ill-written French work, entitled <HI>Les Cau&s;es C&eacute;l&eacute;bres,</HI> might furni&s;h me with very ample materials for &s;o de&s;irable a purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>He advi&s;ed me to &s;elect &s;uch &s;tories from this collection, as though disfigured by the affectation and bad ta&s;te of the compiler, Guyor de Pitaval, might lead us to form awful ideas of the force and danger of the hu|man pa&s;&s;ions. He wi&s;hed me to con&s;ider my|&s;elf <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s under no re&s;triction, but that of adher|ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o authenticated facts; and, by telling each &s;tory in my own way, to render it as much as po&s;&s;ible an intere&s;ting le&s;&s;on of morality.</P>
<P>This hint appeared to me &s;o captivating, that I began the attempt &s;ugge&s;ted, with great plea&s;ure; but &s;oon became &s;en&s;ible of many
<PB N="iv" REF="036316_0005_1008D7ED76F3E6D0">
difficulties I had to encounter. The &s;tyle of the original is frequently ob&s;cure; the facts are often anticipated, and often repeated, in almo&s;t the &s;ame words, in different parts of the &s;tory: they are al&s;o often interrupted by remarks, or by relations wholly foreign to the &s;ubject, by which the attention is bewil|dered and the intere&s;t weakened. I found, indeed, &s;o many minute and unnece&s;&s;ary details, and &s;o much improper and ridiculous de&s;cription, intermixed with the mo&s;t pa|thetic events, that I was &s;ometimes on the point of relinqui&s;hing my undertaking.</P>
<P>Yet it occurred to me, that the rea&s;on which made the work difficult and unplea&s;ant for me to write, would render it, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;hed, a de&s;irable book to tho&s;e who may wi&s;h to obtain &s;ome idea of a celebrated publication, without wading through the ob&s;curities and extraneous matter of M. de Pitaval.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of my work, I met with a new edition of my original, by M. Richer. This gentleman tells his reader, that he has elucidated <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e difficulties and ob&s;curities of his predece&s;&s;or; and I hoped to receive great a&s;&s;i&s;tance from his labours: but I cannot &s;ay the production of M. Richer entirely an&s;wers the promi&s;es of his preface. The &s;tyle is certainly clearer, and the narrative more di&s;|tinct, but it is al&s;o le&s;s intere&s;ting; and in &s;ome in&s;tances he &s;ets forth the circum|&s;tances, and even the cata&s;trophe, in a light
<PB N="v" REF="036316_0006_1008D7EF0C8882E8">
very different from that in which they are placed by M. de Pitaval. I have, however, let the facts remain as related by him from whom I happened to &s;elect them, mentioning only at the end of each &s;tory, the author I have followed.</P>
<P>It is probable, that &s;ome of the&s;e &s;triking &s;tories may have already found their way to the Engli&s;h pre&s;s; but, as I have been my|&s;elf unable to find any preceding tran&s;lation of tho&s;e I had &s;elected, I may pre&s;ume that, with mo&s;t Engli&s;h readers, my work will have the attraction of novelty.</P>
<P>I am aware, indeed, that it is a kind of work from which little &s;ame can ari&s;e to its author; but I have not the fal&s;e pride and delicacy to wi&s;h, that my reader &s;hould &s;up|po&s;e me uninfluenced by humbler motives to publication.</P>
<P>My ambition will be &s;atisfied, if a number of candid readers allow, that, by dint of &s;ome irk&s;ome labour, I have produced a little compilation, not inelegant in it &s;tyle; and, in the matter it contains, both intere&s;ting and in&s;tructive.</P>

<HEAD>THE MARCHIONESS DE GANGE.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been a&s;&s;erted, that there is in human nature a propen&s;ity to every kind of evil; and that per&s;ons of the be&s;t di&s;po&s;ition, and mo&s;t liberal education, may find them&s;elves in &s;uch &s;ituations as will, if their pa&s;&s;ions are &s;uf|fered to predominate, betray them into the mo&s;t frightful exce&s;&s;es, into crimes which can|not be related without horror.</P>
<P>Under the dominion of &s;uch dreadful pa&s;|&s;ions the abb&eacute; and the chevalier de Gange mu&s;t have been, when they committed the inhuman cruelties which are the &s;ubject of the following narrative.</P>
<P>The unfortunate victim of their malice and inhumanity, was the only daughter of the &s;ieur de Rou&s;&s;an of Avignon; and though her birth was not noble, the &s;plendid fortune &s;he was to inherit from the &s;ieur de Nocheres, her maternal grandfather, made her to be con&s;i|dered as a de&s;irable match by the fir&s;t nobility
<PB N="8" REF="036316_0008_1008D7F7BB56A898">
in the province.&mdash;Mademoi&s;elle de Chateau|blanc (as &s;he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;led before her marriage), was not only a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ch heire&s;s, but one of the lovelie&s;t women in France; and the de&s;cription that remains of her per&s;on, which paints her as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of almo&s;t every perfection that adorns the female form, corre&s;ponds with the minia|ture which is extant of her, drawn by Mig|nard, and allowed to be one of his mo&s;t ex|qui&s;ite performances.</P>
<P>With &s;o much per&s;onal beauty, with a &s;oft and compa&s;&s;ionate heart, &s;en&s;e rather &s;olid than lively, a temper &s;erene and gentle, and manners calculated to adorn and enjoy &s;ociety, &s;he was married, at the age of thirteen, to the marquis de Ca&s;tillane, grand&s;on of the duke de Villars. This young man was of an illu&s;|trious family, hand&s;ome and well made, and had received an excellent education, which heightened the good qualities be inherited from nature.</P>
<P>They were married in the year 1649, and the marquis &s;oon afterwards carried his wife to court, where &s;uch a blazing &s;tar could not appear withoutattracting univer&s;al admiration.&mdash;She was immediately acknowledged the reigning beauty of the &s;ea&s;on, and that gay and gallant monarch Louis the fourteenth, was him&s;elf &s;en&s;ible of her uncommon attrac|tions&mdash;admiration of &s;o flattering a nature as would have intoxicated any other young per|&s;on.&mdash;At &s;ome of tho&s;e magnificent &s;pectacles
<PB REF="036316_0009_1008D7F95C55F3B8">
that were then given at court, the king cho&s;e madame de Ca&s;tillane for his partner in danc|ing&mdash;where her elegant dre&s;s, which was mo&s;t fortunately cho&s;en, and the grace with which &s;he performed, gave new lu&s;tre to her charming face and figure.&mdash;She was le&s;s known at court by the name of the marchio|ne&s;s de Ca&s;tillane than by that of the beautiful Proven&ccedil;al.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this di&s;&s;ipated circle, &s;o dangerous to a very young per&s;on, the fair madame de Ca&s;tillane continued perfectly to po&s;&s;e&s;s her rea&s;on; and to tho&s;e with whom &s;he was intimate declared, that &s;he felt the emptine&s;s and fallacy of the plea&s;ures with which &s;he was &s;urrounded, and that they af|forded her no real &s;atisfaction.&mdash;It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, however, that envy would wholly &s;pare a woman &s;o univer&s;ally admired. Some adventures of gallantry were attributed to her, which tho&s;e who knew her be&s;t, declared to be totally void of foundation; and, as no better proof was ever offered of their reality than the &s;candal of the day, it is probable they were the inventions of malice and di&s;|appointment, always ready to rai&s;e, again&s;t &s;uperior excellence, reports, which idlene&s;s and folly are as ready to propagate.</P>
<P>Surrounded with gaieties and luxuries; admired by tho&s;e who &s;aw her, beloved by tho&s;e who knew her, madame de Ca&s;tillane continued &s;ome time at court. And there &s;he
<PB N="10" REF="036316_0010_1008D7FB2FE087E0">
heard the melancholy account of the lo&s;s of the galley in which her hu&s;band &s;ome &s;hort time before had embarked, who being overta|ken by a &s;torm on the coa&s;t of Sicily, peri&s;hed, together with all who were on board.&mdash;Sin|cerely afflicted at his death, &s;he retired to the hou&s;e of a friend, madame d'Ampus, till the regulation of her affairs obliged her to return to Avignon.</P>
<P>When &s;he arrived at her native place, nei|ther the plea&s;ures of liberty, which &s;he might now enjoy, being a widow in the earlie&s;t bloom of youth, nor the effect that her charms (which received new &s;plendour from the dark contra&s;t of her weeds) had on all who beheld her, could engage her to continue in the world&mdash;and &s;he retired for a con&s;iderable time to a convent, where &s;he permitted none to &s;ee her but her particular friends, or &s;uch as had bu|&s;ine&s;s with her relative to her e&s;tate.</P>
<P>But as &s;oon as the &s;evere confinement to which &s;he thought it right to conform, during the fir&s;t year of her widowhood, began to re|lax, through the &s;olicitation of her friends, a crowd of lovers &s;urrounded her&mdash;and among the mo&s;t con&s;picuous, was the young marquis de Gange. His per&s;on was not le&s;s a model of manly beauty, than that of the marchione&s;s de Ca&s;tillane of female grace and loveline&s;s. His fortune was perfectly &s;uitable, and his rank illu&s;trious, being baron de Languedoc, marquis de Gange, and governor of St. Andre.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="036316_0011_1008D7FCB594DBA0">
&mdash;His manners were extremely engaging, and his age did not much exceed twenty&mdash;and &s;o well did the exterior qualities of the&s;e young per&s;ons appear to corre&s;pond, that it &s;lruck all who know them, that they were de&s;igned by Heaven for each other.&mdash;Madame de Ca&s;|tillane, in&s;en&s;ible of every other pa&s;&s;ion, &s;oon felt and returned that of mon&s;ieur de Gange. This &s;econd marriage took place in 1658, and the world applauded a union, which &s;eemed &s;o likely to &s;ecure the happine&s;s of both parties. But however in outward advantages they ap|peared to agree, their &s;ouls were very differ|ent. Proud, fierce, capricious, ob&s;tinate, and gloomy, how little the marquis de Gange re|&s;embled her, with whom his de&s;tiny was united! For &s;ome time, however, after their marriage, he concealed, under the fond at|tentions of the lover and the bridegroom, that unhappy temper, and tho&s;e unplea&s;ant man|ners, that afterwards appeared in the hu&s;band&mdash;and the beautiful marchione&s;s, who was her&s;elf all truth and mildne&s;s, never &s;u&s;pected him to be otherwi&s;e than he then appeared.&mdash; Alas! to the&s;e halcyon days &s;ucceeded others, in which the ardour of his pa&s;&s;ion being abated, he no longer thought it worth his while to di&s;gui&s;e his di&s;po&s;ition. En<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ui and di&s;gu&s;t in&s;en&s;ibly took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the marquis, who began to mix again with the &s;ocieties he had quitted on his marriage&mdash;and the marchione&s;s, being left to follow her own amu&s;ements,
<PB N="12" REF="036316_0012_1008D805381208D0">
turned to be again the admiration of the crowds &s;he had de&s;erted for him; but it was merely for amu&s;ement &s;he did &s;o; and not with any de&s;ign of engaging in affairs of gallan|try.&mdash;She never &s;eriou&s;ly li&s;tened to any of her admirers; but, as &s;oon as &s;he perceived an attachment forming, that was likely to create any real unea&s;ine&s;s, &s;he either wholly excluded &s;uch pretenders from her &s;ociety; or, if &s;he admitted them to it, received them with &s;o much coolne&s;s, that the vaine&s;t among them &s;oon found they had nothing to hope.&mdash;But though her conduct was perfectly in|nocent, the marquis (con&s;cious perhaps of the inequality of their minds) beheld it with jealou&s;y and mi&s;tru&s;t. His temper, naturally moro&s;e and vindictive, was much di&s;po&s;ed to &s;u&s;picion; and his humour became every day more tea&s;ing and di&s;agreeable to his wife&mdash;Yet, as a jealous hu&s;band is in France an ob|ject of ridicule, and as he could find nothing in the conduct of madame de Gange, on which to found any real complaint, he con|&s;trained him&s;elf as much as he could, and &s;uffered the unea&s;ine&s;s of his mind to appear only in the invincible ill temper with which he received his wife&mdash;by which, if &s;he had really had the inclinations he &s;u&s;pected her of, he would only have accelerated the evil he &s;o greatly dreaded.</P>
<P>Such was his &s;ituation of mind, when his two brothers, the abb&eacute; and the chevalier de
<PB N="13" REF="036316_0013_1008D80267AD3DE8">
Gange, came to re&s;ide at his hou&s;e. The elder of them, who was called the abb&eacute; de Gauge, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an uncommon &s;hare of un|der&s;tanding, with the malice and cunning of a fiend. Violent, proud, and ambitious, he &s;tudied to govern every one about him; in which, from his &s;uperior abilities, he u&s;ually &s;ucceeded too well. Having neither prin|ciples of honour or &s;entiments of humanity, no con&s;iderations, no laws, either divine or human, could prevent his carrying any point on which he had once re&s;olved. Yet this diabolical &s;pirit he had art enough to conceal, with the profounde&s;t di&s;&s;imulation, and could a&s;&s;ume the appearance of the mo&s;t amiable, benevolent, and hone&s;t man in the world, while his heart was the receptacle of every vice that di&s;graces human nature. He was not in orders, but took the equivocal title of abb&eacute;, as being the mo&s;t favourable to the in|dulgence of his licentious pa&s;&s;ions. The che|valier, who&s;e under&s;tanding w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> below medi|ocrity, &s;eemed born only to be directed by others; and the abb&eacute;, without his perceiving it, governed him entirely. Over the marquis al&s;o the abb&eacute; acquired the &s;ame a&s;cendancy. His e&s;tate and his family were &s;oon given up to the management of this a&s;&s;iduous brother; who left him the name of ma&s;ter, but en|joyed all the power. The uncommon charms of the marchione&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Gange made an imme|diate and deep impre&s;&s;ion on the heart of this
<PB N="14" REF="036316_0014_1008D806D1D0C2B0">
bad man; nor did the con&s;ideration of her be|ing his brother's wife deter him a moment from forming de&s;igns upon her honour. Scorning to put any re&s;traint on his inclina|tions, however unwarrantable, he determined to attempt &s;educing madame de Gange; and for this purpo&s;e, knowing the influence of gratitude on &s;uch a heart as hers, he began by endeavouring to oblige her. He &s;aw how unea&s;ily &s;he lived with his brother, who fa|tigued her ince&s;&s;antly with jealou&s;y and ill-hu|mour&mdash;and the fir&s;t u&s;e he made of his power over the marquis was, to induce him to alter his conduct towards his wife: of whom the abb&eacute; &s;poke &s;o advantageou&s;ly, that his jealou&s;y began to give place to tho&s;e &s;entiments of e&s;|teem and tenderne&s;s which he had at fir&s;t felt for her. The marchione&s;s, &s;en&s;ible of this change in her hu&s;band's behaviour, gave way to the natural goodne&s;s and &s;weetne&s;s of her di&s;po&s;ition, and forgot the har&s;h treatment &s;he had lately &s;uffered; treatment which was on the point of changing her former attachment into a &s;ettled coldne&s;s, if not aver&s;ion. The abb&eacute;, however, did not intend that madame de Gange &s;hould enjoy the &s;atisfaction &s;he re|ceived from her hu&s;band's returning affection, without knowing to whom &s;he owed it. As &s;oon as an opportunity offered, he took care to tell her, that the marquis's pre&s;ent attention and kindne&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;equence of what he had &s;aid in her favour&mdash;and he gave her at the
<PB N="15" REF="036316_0015_1008D80A48EF4AE0">
&s;ame time to under&s;tand, that the heart of his brother was &s;o entirely in his hands, that her treatment mu&s;t depend wholly on him. Di&s;|gu&s;ted at &s;uch a declaration, the marchione&s;s an&s;wered coolly, that &s;he thanked him. The abb&eacute; was a good deal di&s;appointed at the re|ception &s;he gave him on this occa&s;ion. He had flattered him&s;elf that &s;he would have ac|cepted with more vivacity his proffered &s;er|vices, and that, by fir&s;t engaging her grati|tude, he &s;hould in time create in her brea&s;t warmer &s;entiments in his favour. But though a man of abilities, &s;uch as he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, who de|termines to make him&s;elf agreeable, and has &s;uch continual opportunities of doing &s;o, is above all others the mo&s;t dangerous object a young woman can encounter, it happened that the di&s;like, even bordering on antipathy, which madame de Gange had conceived, on the fir&s;t &s;ight of the abb&eacute;, was an invincible ob&s;tacle to his de&s;igns. Her manner towards him was civil, bnt &s;o cold and di&s;tant, that he could very &s;eldom find an occa&s;ion to &s;peak to her apart. And after &s;ome time, as he &s;aw &s;he &s;tudied to avoid him, and that all his a&s;&s;iduities made no impre&s;&s;ion on her, he de|termined to &s;peak plainly, and to acknowledge his pa&s;&s;ion, in terms that &s;he could not mi&s;|under&s;tand.</P>
<P>The marchione&s;s had engaged her&s;elf to pa&s;s &s;ome days at the country re&s;idence of a friend.&mdash;Thither the abb&eacute; followed her,
<PB N="16" REF="036316_0016_1008D80D44BE0CE0">
and as his conver&s;ation was extremely agree|able, he was received with plea&s;ure by the whole party.&mdash;He was u&s;ually the life of whatever company he was in, and now he ex|erted him&s;elf to the utmo&s;t, and was more brilliant and entertaining than ever. A hunt|ing party being propo&s;ed, at which every gen|tleman was to attend on a lady, the abb&eacute; of|fered him&s;elf to e&s;cort madame de Gange; which &s;he accepted, with her u&s;ual cool civi|lity, as a matter of perfect indifference.&mdash;As &s;oon as the company began to di&s;per&s;e in the woods, the abb&eacute;, who now &s;aw the opportu|nity at hand that he had &s;o long wi&s;hed for, led madame de Gange into the mo&s;t unfre|quented &s;pot he could find, and then, with very little preface, made the confe&s;&s;ion he had meditated&mdash;but &s;o abruptly, and with expre&s;|&s;ions &s;o &s;trong and ardent, that they in&s;pired madame de Gange with terror rather than pi|ty&mdash;who turning pale with &s;urpri&s;e and an|ger, could not immediately form any reply; while the abb&eacute; continued to declare him&s;elf with &s;uch violence of manner, and in terms &s;o unequivocal, that &s;he could not doubt of his being very much in earne&s;t&mdash;and &s;he &s;aw, that to endeavour to laugh it off, us &s;he would have done &s;uch a declaration from a le&s;s re&s;olute lover, would have availed her nothing; a&s;|&s;uming, therefore, an air more re&s;erved than before, &s;he &s;aid&mdash;<Q>I will not, mon&s;ieur Pab|b&eacute;, affect to mi&s;under&s;tand you&mdash;but you

A&s;k your own heart, &s;ir, a&s;k your own con|&s;cience, what decency and duty &s;hould urge me to &s;ay to you&mdash;and &s;pare me the pain of holding a farther conver&s;ation on &s;o odi|ous a &s;ubject.</Q>&mdash;The manner in which &s;he pronounced the&s;e words, made them infi|nitely more mortifying to the abb&eacute;, than the words them&s;elves.

The wicked prie&s;t, who was entirely devoted to the &s;ervice of the abb&eacute; and the chevalier, &s;eeing &s;he had reached the ground without being materially hurt, threw at her a very heavy pitcher of water, which &s;tood in the window next to that from whence &s;he had jumped; and which, if it had fallen on her head, mu&s;t have certainly killed her; but it fell within two or three inches of her. The fir&s;t thought that occurred to her, as &s;oon as &s;he reached the ground, was to endeavour to di&s;charge the poi&s;on that &s;he had &s;wallowed: for this purpo&s;e &s;he took one of the tre&s;&s;es of her long hair, and put it as far as &s;he could down her throat; the expedient &s;ucceeded, and &s;he brought up the noxious mixture, to|gether with what &s;he had eaten, and then at|tempted to make her way out of the inclo&s;ure where &s;he was; but every door was fa&s;tened.

In the mean time the two a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, taking advantage of the night, fled from the &s;cene of their cruelty. It was nine o'clock in the evening when they &s;et out together for Abe|ras, another e&s;tate of the marqui&s;s's, about a league from Gange. There they remained &s;ome time, con&s;idering what they &s;hould next do; and the reproaches they made each other, for not having completed their infa|mous undertaking, ro&s;e at length to &s;uch a height, that they were ready to draw their &s;words on each other.

<P>The marquis de Gange was at Avignon when the news of this bloody cata&s;trophe reached him; and though there is little doubt but that he had agreed with his bro|thers, and even that the de&s;ign originated with him, yet it is probable that he expected they would have completed their undertak|ing by the certain but &s;ilent mode of poi&s;on, and not in a manner &s;o open and undi&s;gui&s;ed. As &s;oon as he learned the particulars, he af|fected the utmo&s;t concern and di&s;tre&s;s, and prote&s;ted he would revenge the cruel treat|ment his wife had received from his brothers, by putting them to death with his own hands. In a word, he rather over-acted his part at fir&s;t, in &s;ome re&s;pects; for it was remarked that, in&s;tead of &s;etting out immediately for Gange, he deferred his departure for four and twenty hours, though it &s;hould &s;eem that not a mo|ment would have been lo&s;t by a man who really loved a wife, &s;o&s;iuated as was madame de Gange. It appeared al&s;o very extraordinary, that to the friends he &s;aw at Avignon after he received the intelligence, he never mentioned what had happened, though it is &s;o natural for a per&s;on under the pre&s;&s;ure of a new affliction to &s;peak of it to every body, and to think of nothing el&s;e. When the marquis arrived at Gange, a monk announced his being there to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he marchione&s;s, and &s;he received him with all
<PB N="41" REF="036316_0041_1008D8544CDD22F8">
the tenderne&s;s and regard that the mo&s;t be|loved hu&s;band could have expected; &s;he only gently reproached him for having left her in the power of his cruel brother. The great judge of hearts, only knows what pa&s;&s;ed in that of the marquis. If he was indeed ac|ce&s;&s;ary to her murder, which there was great room to believe, this reception, &s;o kind and forgiving, mu&s;t have been one of the mo&s;t cruel puni&s;hments he could undergo: he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad the art, however, to compo&s;e his countenance, and not to betray, in his behaviour, the emo|tions which mu&s;t have torn his heart with re|mor&s;e and angui&s;h.</P>
<P>Such was the delicate &s;en&s;ibility of madame de Gange, that recollecting, after &s;ome time, that &s;he had perhaps hurt him by her re|proaches in regard to his brother, &s;he apolo|gi&s;ed to him, and intreated him to impute what|ever &s;he had &s;aid not to any want of affection for him, but to the extremity of her &s;ufferings, which extorted &s;uch complaints from her; and &s;he held out her hand to him in token of perfect amity, and with a &s;weetne&s;s peculiar to her&s;elf. This exce&s;s of goodne&s;s, which one would imagine mu&s;t have been a new puni&s;hment to the marquis, only renewed his hopes of availing him&s;elf of her affection, to &s;ecure the fortune of the dying victim. He de&s;ired her to revoke the act, by which &s;he had confirmed her fir&s;t will made at Avignon; and to confirm that which &s;he had made
<PB N="42" REF="036316_0042_1008D855F3AC93A0">
&s;ince at the in&s;tigation of the abb&egrave;, which the vice-legate, in con&s;equence of the deed be|fore-mentioned, had refu&s;ed to regi&s;ter. But &s;he firmly and po&s;itively prote&s;ted again&s;t making any alteration; and it is believed, that this attempt of the marquis's per&s;uaded her that he had had but too great a &s;hare in the dreadful re&s;olution of taking away her life, though &s;he did not &s;hew her &s;u&s;picions by any change in her behaviour. Certain it is, that tho&s;e about her, who&s;e notions of the marquis's guilt were before very &s;trong, were by this ill-timed and improper reque&s;t confirmed in their evil opinion of him. As he found how fixed madame de Gange was in her determination, he forbore to renew the di&s;cour&s;e, but continued a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly to attend on her every day, at the hou&s;e of the &s;ieur des Prats, where &s;he &s;till remained, not being judged in a &s;ituation to reach Montpellier, though &s;he earne&s;tly de&s;ired it.</P>
<P>Her mother, madame de Rou&s;&s;an, and &s;ome of her relations from Avignon, arrived at Gange the day after the marquis. Ma|dame de Rou&s;&s;an, who had no doubt of the marquis's guilt, was a&s;toni&s;hed to find him attending on her daughter, and to &s;ee them on good terms. Per&s;uaded as &s;he was, that he was the original projector of the infamous &s;cheme to de&s;troy her daughter, &s;he could not with any patience endure to &s;ee him with her; her blood &s;eemed to reco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l at the &s;ight

of him; and, as &s;he was unable to conceal or conquer the aver&s;ion &s;he felt for him, &s;he re|turned in three days to Avignon, notwith|&s;tanding all her daughter's endeavours to prevail on her to &s;tay.</P>
<P>Nothing could be more affecting than the pious &s;entiments of madame de Gange, who declared, that &s;he &s;incerely forgave her mur|derers, and prayed to God to forgive them, and to accept her prayers for their &s;alvation. As there were &s;ometimes faint hopes of her recovery, but oftener total de&s;pair of it, &s;he de&s;ired to receive the &s;acrament.

The hi&s;tory of the abb&eacute;, who was the mo&s;t atrocious criminal, is longer.

Martelliere (which was the name the abb&eacute; went by); but he, fearing that if a body of French refugees were &s;uffered to &s;ettle there, he &s;hould be known either by them of &s;ome of their connections, per&s;uaded the count to refu&s;e his permi&s;&s;ion; and, in &s;hort, he entirely governed the count and his whole family; yet his heart was a prey to remor&s;e and vexation, Notwith&s;tanding which, he paid his addre&s;&s;es to a young lady nearly related to the counte&s;s, under who&s;e protection &s;he was, and in&s;pired her with a mutual pa&s;&s;ion; which &s;oon became known to the counte&s;s, who, though &s;he had a great regard for de la Martelliere, could by no means think of &s;uffering him to form an al|liance with her relation, and therefore told the young lady, that though both the count and her&s;elf highly e&s;teemed de la Martelliere, and meant to reward him generou&s;ly for his &s;ervices to their &s;on, yet that they never would hear of her uniting her&s;elf with a man of ob|&s;cure, and perhaps of &s;candalous birth, and that &s;he mu&s;t therefore think of it no more.

<P>Joachim Cognot, a phy&s;ician, re&s;iding at Bar &s;ur Seine, married, when in his &s;ixtieth year, Mary Na&s;&s;ier, a woman of reputable parents, then about twenty-nine years old. They had &s;everal children, who all died very &s;oon after their birth, except Claude Cognot, who was the la&s;t born before a temporary &s;e|paration of the parents. Doctor Cognot, &s;up|po&s;ing he &s;hould find more bu&s;ine&s;s at Fonte|nay, in Poitou, removed thither, as it &s;hould &s;eem, to try his &s;ucce&s;s, and did not, from con&s;iderations of prudence, remove his family till he &s;aw a probability of his expectations <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eing an&s;wered.

whom he had not &s;een during his re&s;idence at Fontenay. Seven months after madame Cognot rejoined her hu&s;band &s;he was delivered of a daughter, who is the &s;ubject of this hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The doctor, already di&s;po&s;ed to &s;u&s;pect his wife's fidelity, and perhaps having heard &s;omething of her conduct, during his ab&s;ence, that di&s;plea&s;ed him, imagined that this infant had no right to call him father, or to &s;hare with his &s;on, of whom he was pa&s;&s;ionately fond, the fortune he now &s;aw a probability of rai&s;ing. The injurious thoughts he conceived of his wife, he kept however &s;ecret, and the little girl was baptized in the u&s;ual form, and regi&s;tered as the daughter of Joachim Cognot, and Mary Ne&s;&s;ier, his wife. She was put out to nur&s;e; and about eighteen months after|wards, the doctor, who&s;e fame as a phy&s;ician encrea&s;ed, removed to Paris, and was &s;oon e&s;tabli&s;hed there in good practice.</P>
<P>The unfortunate victim of his jealou&s;y, or of his wife's indi&s;cretion, was left behind at Fontenay&mdash;and Cognot though he had, in con&s;equence of his removal, a fair opportunity of concealing this child, whom he was deter|mined to con&s;ider as a di&s;grace to him&s;elf, and an intruder on the property of his &s;on. For this purpo&s;e he ordered her to be &s;ent to Paris by a common carrier; whom he met, and took her, immediately on her arrival, to the Or&s;ine, in the Fauxbourg St. Marceau, where
<PB N="55" REF="036316_0055_1008D871364572A8">
lived a woman named Frances Fremont, the wife of a lock&s;mith, called John Boutet, with whom he agreed to take the little girl at four livres a month. He paid a month's advance, gave the woman a piece of green &s;erge to clothe the child, told her her Chri&s;tian name was Mary, but that &s;he need not enquire her &s;urname, and that &s;he was &s;omething le&s;s than three years old.</P>
<P>The mother of the infant thus abandoned, had been forced, through dread of her hu&s;|band, and perhaps the terror of being expo&s;ed, to agree to this cruel concealment; but her heart revolted again&s;t it, and, after a &s;truggle of &s;ome months between her fear and her affection, &s;he at length went privately to &s;ee her daughter. On entering the hou&s;e, &s;he enquired of the woman, whether &s;he had not taken a little girl to nur&s;e? The woman an&s;wered that &s;he had, and then, looking in the face of madame Cognot, &s;he was &s;truck with the likene&s;s between her and the child, and exclaimed&mdash;"You, madame, are certainly this little girl's mother."</P>
<P>Madame Cognot an&s;wered, in confu&s;ion, that &s;he was not; but her heart refu&s;ed to confirm her denial and unable to con|ceal what &s;he felt, &s;he embraced the child, and bur&s;t into a pa&s;&s;ion of tears. She quitted, however, the hou&s;e as &s;oon as &s;he could recover her&s;elf, and, apprehending the effects of her hu&s;band's anger if &s;he went thither again, &s;he wholly forebore to &s;ee her

This &s;troke did not bring back the heart of madame Cog|not to a &s;en&s;e of her duty; the only u&s;e &s;he made of it &s;eems to have been, that of imme|diately prevailing on her hu&s;band to &s;ign a deed, in which they agreed, that the &s;urvivor of them &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the whole property which Cognot had accumulated.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the woman who nur&s;ed the little girl, took great care of her, though &s;he was no longer paid. The child was of an amiable temper, and had &s;o good an under|&s;tanding, and a per&s;on &s;o agreeable, that &s;he intere&s;ted every body in her favour, but par|ticularly her nur&s;e, who loved her as her own child, and, though &s;he was very poor, never murmured at the burden which had been impo&s;ed upon her.

condition to procure food and raiment for the unfortunate infant which &s;he &s;o tenderly loved.</P>
<P>Time however pa&s;&s;ed away, and the de|&s;erted girl continued in the ho&s;pital; where, notwith&s;tanding the meanne&s;s and poverty of her condition, the under&s;tanding &s;he had re|ceived from nature unfolded it&s;elf, and her gentlene&s;s and propriety of manners procured her the e&s;teem of all who approached her. When &s;he was almo&s;t fourteen years old, and qualified for a &s;ervice, her nur&s;e took her from the ho&s;pital, and put her, at very low wages, to be a &s;ervant to a writing-ma&s;ter; where, while &s;he earned her bread by hard labour, and was employed in the mo&s;t &s;ervile offices, doctor Cognot and his wife enjoyed affluence and pro&s;perity beyond what they had for|merly dared to hope. His practice had very much encrea&s;ed, and he was appointed phy|&s;ician to Margaret de Valois, then queen of France; yet, per&s;uaded that this poor girl was not his own, he determined not to let her benefit by his &s;ucce&s;s, though he had no longer any child who would have been injured by her participation.

his pre&s;ence of mind, and told Frances Fre|mont that the child was not his, but belonged to the man who was with him: he inquired, however, where &s;he was? and, being told that &s;he was &s;ervant to a writing-ma&s;ter near the great &s;teps of La &mdash;, and that &s;he was then ill with a fever, he took a direction to her, and promi&s;ed to &s;ee her; which he did.</P>
<P>This di&s;covery he immediately communi|cated to his wife; who, on hearing her daughter's &s;ituation, could not forbear feeling again that &s;he was a mother, and that &s;he wi&s;hed to have her child re&s;cued from the melancholy de&s;tiny to which &s;he had been &s;o long abandoned. Frances Fremont was not di&s;po&s;ed to let the&s;e good di&s;po&s;itions langui&s;h for want of reminding the parents of their duty. She called upon them in a few days, and de&s;ired to be paid for her trouble, and the food and clothes &s;he had provided for the little girl. The doctor bid her bring the girl thither, which &s;he did the next day; and on her being introduced to madame Cognot, the latter &s;till affecting to conceal her real &s;itua|tion, began to enquire of Frances Fremont, what where her qualifications and what wages &s;he expected; as if &s;he intended hiring her as a &s;ervant; to which Fremont an&s;wered, that &s;he had not brought her thither to get her a &s;er|vice, but to be paid for the many years during which &s;he had kept her, and to re&s;tore her to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er parent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> then looking &s;teadily on madame

Cognot, &s;he exclaimed,&mdash;<Q>You, madam, are the &s;ame lady who came to &s;ee Mary once, and wept over her, and I know you are her mother.</Q> It was agreed that Mary &s;hould, for the pre&s;ent, remain with doctor Cognot; but to people &s;o avaricious it was le&s;s ea&s;y to determined to pay Fremont the long arrear due to her. They put her off from time to time, till her patience being exhau&s;ted, and her ne|ce&s;&s;ities pre&s;&s;ing, &s;he determined to apply to a lawyer; and doctor Cognot was &s;ummoned to appear before the bailiff of St. Germain.</P>
<P>Alarmed at this mea&s;ure, and perceiving that if he &s;uffered a &s;uit again&s;t him to go on, the whole tran&s;action, which he was &s;o de&s;i|rous to conceal, would be di&s;covered; he thought it better to &s;atisfy Fremont, and yet to conceal the birth of his daughter. For this purpo&s;e he cau&s;ed a deed to be drawn up by a notary, to this effect:&mdash;That whereas he was &s;ued by Frances Fremont for a certain &s;um due to her, for the care and board of an infant called Mary, for the &s;pace of fourteen years, which child was not his, but belonged to the man whom he acknowledged to have been with; and as he might be thought in &s;ome mea&s;ure acce&s;&s;ary to the expen&s;e brought on Frances Fremont, though it was merely by ac|cident that it happened, yet he did agree, through motives of charity, to take the &s;aid Mary into his &s;ervice, and to pay the &s;um of four hundred livres to the &s;aid Francis Fremont,

on condition of having no further trouble on the &s;ubject. This deed was &s;igned properly, and Mary was e&s;tabli&s;hed in the hou&s;e of her parents. At fir&s;t &s;he appeared there as a &s;er|vant; but a &s;ervant whom her ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s could not re&s;olve to treat as &s;uch. Her &s;ole employment was working in the room with madame Cognot, keeping her keys, and doing &s;uch little ea&s;y offices as might be required of a daughter. She dined at their table, was dre&s;&s;ed better than a &s;ervant, and money was given her for which &s;he was not expected to account. Still, however, &s;he was not to be con&s;idered as any other than a &s;tranger; and &s;he was told that &s;he was the daughter of a per&s;on called Croi&s;&s;ant, and was called Mary Croi&s;&s;ant&punc; while the acquaintance of madame Cognot, who ob&s;erved the great likene&s;s between her and this girl, concluded &s;he was her niece, or &s;ome very near relation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.

Under the conviction of her illegiti|macy, he made his will anew, and, confirm|ing the former act between him and his wife, which left the &s;urvivor in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the bulk of his fortune, he gave to Mary Croi&s;&s;ant, whom he called his &s;ervant, the &s;um of &s;ix hundred

<P>When he was dead, and his widow &s;e|cured in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his effects, &s;he con|tinued to ob&s;erve the &s;ame conduct towards her daughter, and, making a kind of compro|mi&s;e between her avarice and her affection, &s;till kept her with her, but &s;till refu&s;ed to ac|knowledge her as her daughter; becau&s;e in that ca&s;e &s;he mu&s;t have &s;hared the property &s;he now exclu&s;ively enjoyed.</P>
<P>Some time after a &s;uitable match offering with Augu&s;tus de Seine, a man e&s;tabli&s;hed in a reputable profe&s;&s;ion, &s;he married her, under the name of Mary Croi&s;&s;ant, her god-daughter. In this, as in every other part of her conduct, &s;he &s;eemed to unveil the my&s;tery &s;he endea|voured to conceal; doing too much for her if it was only an orphan taken out of charity, as &s;he pretended, and too little if it was her daughter. It happened that Marie de Seine (as &s;he &s;hould now be called, in con&s;equence of her marriage), was one day a&s;&s;i&s;ting her mother to look over and arrange &s;ome pa|pers of the old doctor's.

The mother, however, in&s;tantly recollecting what it was, in&s;i&s;ted on her returning it, which &s;he for &s;ome time tried to evade: but her mother's commands being peremptory, &s;he yielded to give up the letter which had taught her to know to whom &s;he belonged; but &s;he &s;aid, with tears, to her mother, <Q>Ah, madam, I am your daughter; I am the little Mary of whom you here &s;peak &s;o af|fectionately; why would you continue to di&s;own me?

With a promi&s;e of being &s;oon pro|perly re&s;tored to her right, the young woman

was for &s;ome time content, as &s;he was every day in hopes that her mother would find the opportunity &s;he pretended to wait for; but &s;he had &s;oon the mortification to find, that other views occupied her, and that to do ju&s;|tice to her daughter was farther than ever from her intention. A man called Nicholas Coquant, who was without any property, and had a great number of children, was intro|duced to the widow Cognot; he &s;oon found the means of gaining her good opinion; &s;he married him, and from that period though only of &s;tifling the claims of her unfortunate daughter, and enriching the family on which &s;he now had placed all her affections.</P>
<P>Her daughter, who &s;aw all the fatal con&s;e|quence of this new connection, conjured her by all that was ju&s;t, by every con&s;ideration o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> affection and honour, to re-e&s;tabli&s;h her in he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> rights, before &s;he made this imprudent mar|riage.

Wearied at length with their ineffectual efforts, and de&s;|pairing to move the implacable heart of her mother, &s;he determined, in vindication of her own and her childrens' rights, to have recour&s;e to law; though it was with extreme reluctance &s;he was driven to take &s;uch a re&s;olutions&mdash;Madame Cognot being now again &s;ummoned
<PB N="65" REF="036316_0065_1008D87DDC179EB0">
before the bailiff of St. Germain, had recour&s;e to all the chicane of the law. She was ob|liged however to undergo an examination<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> in the cour&s;e of which a perpetual conte&s;t be|tween her avarice, her fear of detection, and her con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the truth, evidently ap|peared. On being a&s;ked if &s;he had not a daughter born at Fontenay de Compte, called Mary, and in what year? &s;he an&s;wered, that &s;he had, but the year &s;he could not remember. On being farther a&s;ked, what was become of her? &s;he &s;aid, the child was put to nur&s;e with the wife of a baker; and that four or five months afterwards, on her return from a jour|ney to Bar fur Seine, where &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time, her hu&s;band informed her that the child was dead; and that &s;he never enquired any more about it. On being que&s;tioned, how &s;he came to receive the plaintiff into her hou&s;e, and to place her in a rank &s;o different from &s;ervitude? &s;he replied, that in returning home one day, &s;he found at her hou&s;e two women and a little girl; and that her hu&s;band &s;aid to her, the&s;e women have brought a little girl to be your &s;ervant, who will be very faith|ful. That &s;he a&s;ked Fremont, one of the wo|men, how much wages &s;he was to give her? who an&s;wered, that wages were no object; that &s;he thereupon detained her in her &s;ervice, and that the girl had lived with her from that time till &s;he &s;ettled her in her marriage. Many other contradictory and incoherent an&s;wers
<PB N="66" REF="036316_0066_1008D8C6EA1F2460">
plainly evinced the difficulty of concealing the truth. This appeared &s;o clearly to the bailiff of St. Germain, that he gave &s;entence; wherein he ordered madame Coquant to re|ceive and acknowledge Mary Cognot, the wife of Augu&s;tus de Seine, as her daughter; and condemned her to pay twenty-four louis as co&s;ts; to divide all the property of the decea&s;ed Joachim Cognot with her daughter; to whom liberty was al&s;o given to &s;ue for the arrears and profits received &s;ince his death.</P>
<P>From this &s;entence madame Coquant ap|pealed to the parliament; a provi&s;ion of four hundred livres was allowed to Mary de Seine, to enable her to carry on the &s;uit; they both underwent an examination; and the &s;uit went on in the u&s;ual forms.</P>
<P>But madame Coquant having found that her daughter had been put into the ho&s;pital by her nur&s;e, contrived to get acce&s;s to the book, where all the children received into that a&s;ylum, are regi&s;tered. She found the name of her daughter written there; but &s;imply as Mary the daughter of &mdash;, a blank being left after the incomplete name. This blank &s;he contrived to have filled up, &s;o that the re|gi&s;ter ran thus&mdash;Mary Boutet, a foundling; &s;uckled by the wife of John Boutet, decea&s;ed.</P>
<P>When the cau&s;e came on, mon&s;ieur de Mai|tre, coun&s;el for Mary de Seine, recapitulated the events of her life with great preci&s;ion and exactne&s;s,&mdash;he proved all the facts here re|lated
<PB N="67" REF="036316_0067_1008D880AA3C1A70">
incontrovertibly; and as to the regi&s;ter of the ho&s;pital, he made the alteration clearly appear, as well as the fal&s;ehood it a&s;&s;erted. For Frances Fremont the wife of John Boutet, who&s;e name had been in&s;erted, had never had a child, and of cour&s;e could not have &s;uckled a foundling; whom in fact &s;he never &s;aw till &s;he was three years old.</P>
<P>The defence &s;et up by the mother and her hu&s;band was &s;o feeble, and the legitimacy of Mary de Seine was proved &s;o much to the &s;a|tisfaction of the court, that a definitive &s;en|tence was obtained in &s;avour of her and her children; whereby the gift of Joachim Cog|not to his wife was annulled&mdash;half the effects left by him at his death was awarded to his daughter, after deducting half his funeral ex|pen&s;es, the provi&s;ion made for his wife on her marriage, and his legacies.&mdash;Nicholas Coquant and his wife were to bear the co&s;ts; and for|bidden to damage, conceal, or di&s;&s;ipate the re&s;idue of the effects of Joachim Cognot, which, after the death of the mother, were to de&s;cend to the daughter and her chil|dren.</P>
<P>By this equitable deci&s;ion the unnatural pa|rent was puni&s;hed for her avarice and cruelty; the hitherto unhappy young woman rein&s;tated in the rank to which &s;he had an undoubted right; and the injury done her by the jealous &s;u&s;picions of one of her parents, or the un|guarded conduct of the other, was repaid by
<PB N="68" REF="036316_0068_1008D8C9D88FD780">
the ju&s;tice of her country. She appears to have merited her good fortune, and to have been an in&s;tance that the force of natural good &s;en&s;e and a virtuous di&s;po&s;ition can alone counteract all the di&s;advantages of birth, and all the influence of a mean or neglected edu|cation. While her &s;tory may &s;erve to guard the mother, who re&s;pects the peace of her children, from being guilty of indi&s;cretions which may rai&s;e, in jealous and &s;u&s;picious minds, opinions and prejudices, &s;o fatal to the innocent objects on which the puni&s;hment of guilt, or of imprudence, too frequently falls.</P>

<P>LOUIS de la Pivardiere, &s;ieur du Bouchet, was a gentleman of a very ancient family, but being a younger brother, and his family having lo&s;t much of its former opulence in the convul&s;ions that had agitated the kingdom, his fortune was hardly enough to &s;upport him with decency, in the province of which he was a native; and it mu&s;t have been incon&s;i|derable indeed, if the &s;mall po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the woman he married, induced him to unite him&s;elf with her, for they did not amount to above a thou&s;and livres a year; and &s;he had the five children of her former hu&s;band to maintain; being the widow of the &s;ieur de Menou, and about five and thirty years of age.

<P>In 1689, on the arriere band being called out, the &s;ieur de la Pivardiere &s;erved as lord
<PB N="70" REF="036316_0070_1008D8CCDAA5E258">
of Nerbonne, which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in right of his wife, and obtained a lieutenancy in a re|giment of dragoons. This ab&s;ence was pro|bably equally agreeable to mon&s;ieur and ma|dame de la Pivardiere, for they had long lived very unea&s;y together. On his return their di&s;&s;entions encrea&s;ed; for the tongue of ma|lice had been very bu&s;y with the fame of the lady. The prior of a neighbouring mona&s;tery had been too a&s;&s;iduous in his attentions to madame de Pivardiere; and though there was a chapel in the ca&s;tle of Nerbonne, where his duty obliged him to &s;ay ma&s;s every Satur|day, the neighbourhood would not allow that to be a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for his pa&s;&s;ing almo&s;t every day there, on a footing of familiarity with madame de la Pivardiere, which might be very innocent, but could hardly fail of being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> otherwi&s;e.

After a &s;hort &s;tay therefore at Ner|bonne, he took his hor&s;e, and for &s;ome time

wandered from one town to another, till chance led him to Auxerre, where, in &s;trol|ling on the ramparts of the town, he &s;aw a party of girls dancing: one of them was un|commonly pretty, and La Pivardiere followed her home, where he found that &s;he was the daughter of a hu&s;&s;ier<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An inferior po&s;t in the law or police, &s;omething re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="9 letters"> the bailiffs or &s;heriffs officers.</NOTE>, who who kept a little ale-hou&s;e in the &s;uburbs, where his widow &s;till lived. Acce&s;s to an inhabitant of &s;uch a place was not difficult; La Pivardiere took a lodging in the hou&s;e, and boarded with the widow, under the name of Du Bouchet. But he &s;oon found that the object of his wi&s;hes, though of humble fortune, had principles too &s;trict to li&s;ten to him, on any other terms than tho&s;e of honour, and that he mu&s;t marry her or quit her. After a &s;hort &s;truggle with his pride, and his apprehen&s;ions of detection, love got the better of both. He determined to forget that he was born a gentleman, and, as far as he could, to obliterate the remem|brance of his name, and (what he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> de&s;irous of burying in oblivion) his ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters"> with madame de Menou.

who became pregnant; a circum&s;tance that probably made La Pivardiere think more &s;tea|dily of fixing his pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment on the &s;ecure&s;t ba&s;is it would admit. He determined to go back to Nerbonne, to receive what mo|ney was due from the tenants, and to return with it as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible to his new family at Auxerre. On his arrival at the chateau of Nerbonne, he found the prior with madame de Pivardiere; of which, being wholly occu|pied by the purpo&s;e of his jourdey, he took no notice.

As &s;oon a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he had collected all the money he could, he returned impatiently to Auxerre, where his young wife &s;oon after lay in.

<P>Though this commerce had been carried on for four years without di&s;covery, it could not always continue concealed. Madame <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Pivardiere was at length informed, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

<P>The fourth of the&s;e journies, however, was le&s;s fortunate than the preceding three. Ju&s;t before he arrived at his chateau, his wife had received the intelligence of his infidelity, and knew how to account for his yearly vi&s;it, which &s;he found was not to obtain money to &s;upport his rank in the army, but to be&s;tow on another family. Though already e&s;tranged from him, the mortifying a&s;&s;urance of his preference of another, was too painful to her vanity, and &s;he determined not to con|ceal the bitterne&s;s and anger which &s;he felt.

<P>The next morning mon&s;ieur de la Pivar|diere was mi&s;&s;ed, and no one knew whither he was gone; his hor&s;e, his cloak, and his pi&s;tols being left, made an extraordinary impre&s;&s;ion on the neighbours; and, after a few days, a report obtained, that his wife, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the prior of Mezaray, had cau&s;ed him to be a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;inated.

cu&s;tody. They both, on being interrogated, owned that mon&s;ieur de la Pivardiere had been a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated. The fir&s;t, who was called Mar|garet Mercier, and who was her mi&s;tre&s;s's god-daughter, and a great favourite with her, declared that &s;he had &s;ent every body away, who was likely to prevent the murder, and had introduced two &s;ervants of the prior of Me|zeray into her ma&s;ter's bed-chamber, who had killed him; to which &s;he added &s;everal cir|cum&s;tances which &s;eemed to confirm the truth of her &s;tory. The other maid-&s;ervant, named Catharine le Moine, corroborated this account; and what appeared yet more con|vincing, the daughter of de la Pivardiere, a girl about eight or nine years old, &s;aid, that in the night &s;he was alarmed by hearing her father's voice, who cried,&mdash;"Oh my God, have mercy upon me!"</P>
<P>In the&s;e accounts they all firmly per&s;i&s;ted; and the neighbours declared that they remem|bered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> heard the report of a gun or pi&s;|tol <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> might.&mdash;Margaret Mercier be|ing taken dangerou&s;ly ill, and being about to receive the la&s;t &s;acraments, again prote&s;ted that all &s;he had &s;aid was true, and that the prior had him&s;elf a&s;&s;i&s;ted, and had given the final blow which deprived de la Pivardiere of his life.</P>
<P>On receiving the&s;e depo&s;itions, the officers of ju&s;tice, of whom the judge of Chatillon was chief, ordered madame de la Pivardere to be
<PB N="77" REF="036316_0077_1008D88F0FE2F888">
pro&s;ecuted; and, as the prior of Mezeray was included in the accu&s;ation, a like order was i&s;&s;ued again&s;t him. The judge of Chatillon was &s;aid to be the inveterate enemy of the prior de Mezaray; and, from the circum&s;tances that attended the affair, it &s;eems probable that that enmity was the cau&s;e of all the mea&s;ures which were taken, to fix on the prior a &s;hare of a crime which had not been committed, and that the evidence given by the two maids, was in con&s;equence of the rewards offered them by this officer, who wi&s;hed to gratify, under the cloak of ju&s;tice, his private hatred and revenge.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tance of madame de la Pivar|diere's quitting her hou&s;e, &s;eemed to be a &s;trong argument of her guilt. As &s;oon as &s;he was gone, the lieutenant of the police went thither to examine the chateau; and in his account he a&s;&s;erted, among many other particulars, which &s;eemed to confirm the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, that blood was found on the floor of the room where de la Pivardiere had &s;lept. Madame de la Pivardiere then went to Paris, where &s;he laid before a &s;uperior court, an account of the pro&s;ecution that had been commenced again&s;t her, and de&s;ired that cognizance might be taken of it, by its being referred to an officer of the law more impartial than him who had in&s;tituted the proce&s;s. Her reque&s;t was granted, and the judge of Remorentin was di|rected to inve&s;tigate the whole.</P>

In the mean time madame de la Pivardiere a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly employed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in endeavours to di&s;cover the place of her hu&s;band's retreat.

He &s;oon found that agents from his wife were in pur&s;uit of him; and, fearing that &s;he was now about to have him confined for bigamy, he fled from his hou&s;e; but his pur&s;uers overtook him at Flavigny, and quieted his fears on that account by informing him that he had nothing to ap|prehend from his wife at pre&s;ent, in regard to his liberty, for that his appearance was ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ave her life. He no &s;ooner learned this, than, forgetting all their animo&s;ity, he ha&s;tened to clear her from the imputation of &s;o horrid a crime. His &s;econd wife generou&s;ly encouraged him to this ex|ertion; and, far from re&s;enting the injury he had done her by a feigned marriage, or wi&s;hing to de&s;troy her rival, &s;he was anxiou&s;ly de&s;irous of &s;aving her from the fatal con&s;e|quence of a fal&s;e accu&s;ation.</P>
<P>De la Pivardiere went before a notary at Auxerre, where he &s;igned a declaration of his being living and in health. He wrote

al&s;o to his wife and to his brother, who in their an&s;wers informed him his pre&s;ence was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary at Nerbonne. Thither, therefore, he went, and found his chateau plundered of every thing: the be&s;t of his ef|fects his wife had removed, to &s;ecure them; the re&s;t, as &s;he had fore&s;een, were the prey of the officers of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>He pre&s;ented him&s;elf before the judge of Remorentin, and de&s;ired that the authenticity of his appearance might be te&s;tified by the proper per&s;ons, and that he would accompany him to Nerbonne. On their arrival, the in|habitants of the village, the tenants and neighbours of La Pivardiere, &s;igned the te&s;ti|monial of his being alive; he went from thence to the little town of Jeumaloches and being de&s;irous to &s;hew him&s;elf as publicly as po&s;&s;ible, he entered the church ju&s;t as ve&s;|pers began on St. Anthony's day, who being the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">utelary &s;aint of the pari&s;h, and of the church, it was on that occa&s;ion very much crouded.

<P>But notwith&s;tanding the undoubted cer|tainty of his being alive, &s;uch was the &s;ingular power lodged in the hands of the provincial

judges in France, and &s;uch the abu&s;e often made of it, that the judge of Chatillon &s;till carried on the pro&s;ecution; the &s;u&s;|pen&s;ion of the prior of Mezaray was conti|nued, and his benefices for the time remained under confi&s;cation.

<P>The two &s;ervants were confined in the pri|&s;on of Chatillon, where this magi&s;trate had them entirely in his power, and where his offers of reward and threats of puni&s;hment were all employed to bring them to his purpo&s;e. The judge of Remorentin took de la Pivardiere to the&s;e women; who, be+ing now con&s;ummate in perjury, alleged that the per&s;on they at pre&s;ent &s;aw, pretending to be mon&s;ieur de la Pivardiere, their ma&s;ter, was an impo&s;tor, whom they knew not.

con&s;equence, from which, if he were once in cu&s;tody, he could not e&s;cape. For the&s;e rea|&s;ons, he refu&s;ed to obey the order of the judge of Chatillon, and went from thence with the judge of Remorentin, who afterwards ac|companied him to all his relations, to tho&s;e who were pre&s;ent when he arrived at the chateau of Nerbonne, the night of his &s;up|po&s;ed a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination; to his two &s;i&s;ters, nuns in the Ur&s;ul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne convent at Valence; and his per&s;on was by all the&s;e people acknowledged and identified.

<P>But the judge of Chatillon would not &s;o ea&s;ily relinqui&s;h the prey he held with the &s;trong gra&s;p of authority. He found, that as he had gone &s;o far, the bolde&s;t &s;teps only could carry him on.

The judge of Chatillon died be|fore it came on; and his heirs, a&s;hamed pro|bably of a tran&s;action that would throw in|famy on his memory, petitioned for leave to withdraw; but de la Pivardiere, and the prior of Mezaray, now in&s;i&s;ted on its being brought to an i&s;&s;ue. It was heard accordingly. No damages were allowed de la Pivardiere for all the injury he had &s;u&s;tained, as the judge was &s;uppo&s;ed to have proceeded origi|nally on good grounds. But Margaret Mer|cier, the principal witne&s;s, who had perjured her&s;elf in three or four in&s;tances, was to make the <HI>amende honourable,</HI> by &s;tanding in a &s;heet at the door of the church of Chatillon, holding a torch in her hand; and there, on her knees, and in an audible voice, to ac|knowledge that &s;he had borne fal&s;e witne&s;s, for which &s;he a&s;ked pardon of God and the injured parties; afterwards &s;he was to be whipped, burned with a hot iron, and bani&s;hed the province for ever.</P>
<P>Madame de la Pivardiere, the prior of Mezaray, and his &s;ervants, were declared in|nocent, and di&s;charged from any future trouble.</P>

<HEAD>THE CONTESTED MARRIAGE.</HEAD>
<P>COURTIN de Villiers, a young officer of a noble family, being in garri&s;on at Metz, became acquainted with, madame Geoffroi, who having been left a widow, while yet in the earlie&s;t bloom of youth, re|&s;ided there with the mother of her decea&s;ed hu&s;band. De Villiers, who was at fir&s;t at|tracted by the beauty of the young widow, found the charms of her under&s;tanding, and the &s;weetne&s;s of her temper, equal to the per|fections of her per&s;on. He found al&s;o, that all hopes of forming with her a connection of gallantry, were ra&s;hly entertained; and that his addre&s;&s;es mu&s;t be open, and authori&s;ed by the laws of honour. The longer his acquaint|ance continued, the more impo&s;&s;ible he found it to quit her; but he knew he mu&s;t not hope for the con&s;ent of his father and mother; yet, flattering him&s;elf, that if he were actually married he &s;hould obtain their pardon, and his in&s;urmountable pa&s;&s;ion urging him to hazard the trial, he, prevailed on madame
<PB N="85" REF="036316_0085_1008D89B5217E5A0">
Geoffroi, who was not in&s;en&s;ible of his merit or his affection, to con&s;ent to a union, which it was not po&s;&s;ible for them to celebrate in France with the u&s;ual forms. Her father was yet living, and had not been con&s;ulted; and the parents of de Villiers, he was &s;ure, would refu&s;e their con&s;ent, without which, as he was but two-and-twenty, and the lady only three months older, they could not be married according to law. The mother of her fir&s;t hu&s;band, with whom madame Geoffroi re|&s;ided, moved by the importunities of Villiers, and the wi&s;hes of her daughter, con&s;ented to a&s;&s;i&s;t at, and to conceal the marriage&punc; but as no prie&s;t dared &s;olemnize it at Metz, they were &s;till embarra&s;&s;ed with difficulties, that &s;eemed un&s;urmountable, till the almoner of the regiment to which Villiers belonged told them, he could marry them in Lorraine, that country being then under the government of its own princes, and the laws in force there, in regard to marriage, did not require the con&s;ent of parents to the marriage of mi|nors.</P>
<P>The almoner therefore was &s;ent into Lor|raine, with the &s;ecrecy his &s;cheme required. Thither he was followed by Villiers and the fair widow; and as &s;oon as they were married they returned to Metz, equally happy in their union, and not doubting its legality; after the precautions they had taken. Madame Vil|liers, about ten months afterwards, was deli|vered
<PB N="86" REF="036316_0086_1008D8E25D20D920">
of a &s;on; an event which, while it in|crea&s;ed the happine&s;s of her hu&s;band, made him reflect with anxiety on the di&s;advantage under which this beloved infant might lie, from the clande&s;tine manner of its parents' marriage. Not daring to baptize it by his own name, he called it Tincour de Virilles, an anagram on the name of Courtin de Villiers.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as his wife was well enough to al|low him to quit her, Villiers, who grew more unea&s;y every day for the fate of his &s;on, went to Paris. He there addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the &s;ieur de Lalande, the father of madame Vil|liers, and be&s;ought, in the mo&s;t affecting manner, his approbation of their marriage; but he found only anger and indignation, which embittered the ab&s;olute refu&s;al he re|ceived. To add to his unhappine&s;s, his father and mother were by this, time informed of his connection, and he heard that they had not only pa&s;&s;ed an act, which di&s;-inherited him, if he did not immediately relinqui&s;h his wife, but had commenced a &s;uit again&s;t her for &s;e|duction, and having made a pretended marriage with a minor.</P>
<P>Their fir&s;t mea&s;ure was, to petition for leave to collect information. It was obtained, and the wife of Villiers was &s;ummoned to appear. She appealed again&s;t the &s;ummons, and procured an arret, in the name of the widow Geoffroi, which delayed any further
<PB N="87" REF="036316_0087_1008D89FC7D6E1B8">
proceedings for &s;ome time. In the mean time Villiers, and every friend he could inte|re&s;t on his behalf, tried, by intreaties and &s;upplications, to prevail on his parents to ra|tify by their con&s;ent a union on which the happine&s;s of their &s;on depended. But it was in vain he endeavoured to move them by tears and prayers; in vain his friends inter|ceded for him, with remon&s;trance and exhor|tation: his parents were inexorable; and, hoping that time and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which &s;o often cure exce&s;&s;ive pa&s;&s;ions, would, before many months were elap&s;ed, make their &s;on as anxious to break his connexion as he now was to confirm it, they per&s;evered in tho&s;e mea&s;ures, by which they hoped to render the marriage abortive, and the child illegitimate. While they were pro&s;ecuting the&s;e mea&s;ures, Villiers and his family were reduced to the cruele&s;t exigence. His allowance had been withdrawn, and he had no longer money to &s;upport his rank in his regiment, or to pro|cure his wife and his child the nece&s;&s;aries they required. The expen&s;es of the &s;uit filled up the mea&s;ure of tho&s;e inconveniencies to which they were expo&s;ed; and when he found that his father would furni&s;h him with nothing till he di&s;owned his marriage, he was obliged, rather than &s;ee tho&s;e he &s;o tenderly loved &s;ubject to the di&s;tre&s;s of poverty, to agree to &s;ay whatever they would have him, and even to procure a certificate, which on being

<P>As &s;oon as that period arrived, he produced to a notary the certificate of his marriage; he had by this time prevailed on the &s;ieur Lalande, his wife's father, not only to forgive the in|di&s;cretion &s;he had been guilty of, but to enter warmly into their mutual intere&s;t, and en|deavour to &s;ecure a marriage, which could not be di&s;&s;olved, without covering with di&s;|honour a daughter of whom he was de&s;ervedly fond. Villiers now &s;ignified to his parents, that he was determined to maintain the vali|dity of his marriage: whereupon they again applied to have it &s;et a&s;ide, as being wholly illegal.</P>
<P>Their &s;on, at the &s;ame time, pre&s;ented to the &s;ame tribunal a reque&s;t, that if his mar|riage was found good, it might be legally e&s;|tabli&s;hed. The parents oppo&s;ed it, and in their oppo&s;ition were &s;u&s;tained by the whole power and intere&s;t of the families allied to that of Villiers, who became almo&s;t all par|ties.

<P>To prove that the marriage was not only illegal in it&s;elf, but that the very certificate was a forgery, he &s;aid it was &s;igned by the prie&s;t, with a title which exi&s;ts not in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e church; and the place of celebration, which at the fir&s;t writing of the certificate had been omitted, had been afterwards interlined. Be|&s;ides, the defence &s;et up was in the name of the widow Geoffroi; which name &s;he &s;hould certainly not have continued, while con&s;cious &s;he was the wife of De Villiers. The young man had, moreover, given to the mini&s;ter, Chamillard, an a&s;&s;urance in writing that he was not married, and had repeated the &s;ame in letters to his mother. And if he afterwards affirmed what he had &s;o repeatedly denied, it could be imputed only to the influence which the &s;ieur Lalande, with whom he now lived, had acquired over him, and of his love for the widow, who employed all her art, and all her charms, to retain him in the &s;etters &s;he had forged for him. Why, if the parties were con&s;cious that they were married, did they baptize the child, born of the marriage, by a fictitious name? and not &s;uffer it to bear that of either of its parents?

indi&s;putable, it remained to be known whe|ther the &s;on of an illu&s;trious family, connected with the noble&s;t hou&s;es in the kingdom, could, without the con&s;ent of his parents, ally him|&s;elf with the daughter of an ob&s;cure man, who, from a very low &s;tation, had by dint of long &s;ervice obtained the rank of brigadier; and, though it could not be denied, that his wife, who was of the hou&s;e of Balletrier, in Artois, was the daughter of a very ancient family, yet the nobility of his wife could not conceal or amend his own low origin.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the inequality of birth, the inequa|lity of fortune was al&s;o great, between the wi|dow Geoffroi and captain de Villiers. The &s;ieur Lalande, her father, boa&s;ted, it is true, of an income of twenty-five thou&s;and livres a year; but when he was a&s;ked to name the e&s;tates, or &s;ource, from whence this revenue aro&s;e, he brought no proof that he really po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed it. In the contract of marriage made between his daughter and mon&s;ieur Geoffroi, her fir&s;t hu&s;band, he had agreed to give her a portion of twenty-five thou&s;and livres; but they did not appear ever to have been, paid. Yet &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed nothing el&s;e, or any &s;ecurity that her father would give her a &s;hare of his fortune, wherever it lay. It was &s;aid that the mother of mon&s;ieur Geoffroi meant to make her her heir; but of this there was no cer|tainty: as to the jointure of a thou&s;and livres a year, which &s;he was paid from the property
<PB N="92" REF="036316_0092_1008D8EB0B20FBD8">
of her fir&s;t hu&s;band, it was not only trifling in it&s;elf, but terminated with her life.&mdash;Captain de Villiers, though his parents had three other children, another &s;on and two daughters, was yet to be con&s;idered as heir to the greater part of his father's property, amounting to above four hundred thou&s;and livres; his brother being in the order of Malta, and his two &s;i&s;ters having only very &s;mall portions, if they did not (as they proba|bly would) take the veil. The di&s;parity there|fore between his fortune, and that of the wi|dow Geoffroi, was evidently &s;o great, that his parents thought they had on that account, as well as on that of the inequality of birth, a right &s;teadily to oppo&s;e the confirmation or renewal of a match, &s;o ruinous to the intere&s;t of their &s;on, and &s;o di&s;agreeable to them&s;elves. But were not their objections to the marriage &s;o numerous, and &s;o invincible, from the&s;e rea&s;ons, the &s;eduction which had been prac|ti&s;ed on their &s;on, was a circum&s;tance, in it|&s;elf &s;ufficient to make them determine, never to con&s;ent to his marrying a woman capable of &s;uch practice.

And though the parents, and their relations, could not po&s;itively affirm that the widow Geoffroi was a woman of loo&s;e character, yet a widow of her age, en|couraging the vi&s;its of officers in garri&s;on, could certainly not be thought entirely blame|le&s;s; and as &s;he was older than the chevalier Villiers, who had ju&s;t left the bo&s;om of his family, there was every appearance, that very di&s;ho|nourable means had been u&s;ed to obtain his affections; means, which amounted to the crime of &s;eduction, and which therefore ren|dered her incapable of being received as his wife, and even liable to puni&s;hment. <HI>That,</HI> however, the &s;ieur de Villiers and his family did not in&s;i&s;t on; they only de&s;ired that the chevalier Villers might for ever be &s;eparated from her, and re&s;tored to his family.

That it was in vain the adver&s;e parties a&s;&s;erted that the celebration of the marriage was merely &s;uppo&s;itious, and affected to bring the mi&s;take in the certificate, and the interlineations, as proofs. The fir&s;t was a mere error, originating in the igno|rance of the per&s;on who wrote it; and the &s;e|cond only an omi&s;&s;ion. Had it been a forgery, more care would have been taken to avoid de|fects. It was objected, that this certificate had not been produced till the parties were out of their minority. But this was occa&s;ioned by the fear of their being parted forever by the power of the &s;ieur de Villiers, if they had braved his authority before the laws in &s;ome degree had emancipated his &s;on. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, the wife of the chevalier de Villiers, had an&s;wered her &s;ummons in the name of the widow Geoffroi. And if the chevalier de Villers had denied his marriage, it was through the pre&s;&s;ing exigence to which he was reduced; when his father no longer allowed him money, and he could not either &s;upport his wife and his child, or furni&s;h him&s;elf with nece&s;&s;aries for the campaign, on which his duty obliged him to &s;erve. On reference to the letters and papers, wherein he had di&s;owned his marriage, it appeared that he had &s;aid

good family in England; and, though he could not from thence be accounted noble in France, yet he had obtained a certificate of his rank from the king of England, in con&s;e|quence of which the king of France had granted him letters of nobility. His father had from them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> taken the title of &s;eigneur de Lalande, which his elder brother now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, toge|ther with &s;everal e&s;tates belonging to the fa|mily.

<P>Their &s;econd plea, that of di&s;parity of for|tune, was equally ill-founded. The &s;ieur de Lalande was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;everal e&s;tates; his wife was of an illu&s;trious family in Artois, and by the death of her relations &s;he now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in her right, the e&s;tates of the family, to the amount of more than ten thou&s;and livres a year; be&s;ides which, the &s;ieur de Lelande po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed other property, which made the whole of his income above twenty-five thou|&s;and livres: and if the &s;ieur de Villiers would agree to let the cau&s;e be concluded by the union of the young people, on condition that
<PB N="97" REF="036316_0097_100A314DC6654C70">
he &s;hould produce for his daughter a &s;um equal to what the &s;ieur de Villiers would im|mediately give his &s;on, he was content to abide by the i&s;&s;ue. In this part of his pleading, the coun&s;ellor Blaru addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to madame de Villiers, mother of the chevalier, who was in court: "Do you hear, madam," &s;aid he <Q>the offer I make, and do you under&s;tand that I am authorized by my client to pro|po&s;e the&s;e terms to you?</Q> The lady remain|ing &s;ilent, he repeated this propo&s;al; to which no an&s;wer being given, he &s;aid, that he ap|prehended his client, &s;o far from being very much inferior to the &s;ieur Villiers in point of fortune, was really in a condition to wi&s;h to be put to this proof, which his adver&s;ary could not venture to accept.</P>
<P>The third objection, brought by the &s;ieur de Villiers again&s;t the daughter of his client, was founded on reflections on her conduct, equally injurious and unju&s;t, &s;ince the adver&s;e party knew it was &s;o irreproachable, that, though they had employed every po&s;&s;ible me|thod to di&s;cover &s;ome indi&s;cretion, &s;ome error, none could be produced again&s;t her; they were therefore forced to content them&s;elves with remote hints and groundle&s;s pre&s;ump|tions; but, as the honour of a woman, and above all of a young and beautiful woman in her &s;ituation, is the mo&s;t delicate, and mo&s;t ea&s;ily blemi&s;hed, he determined to wipe off the &s;tain the&s;e cruel, though remote hint<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="98" REF="036316_0098_1008D921C8C81BA0">
might leave, by producing te&s;timony of her conduct. He then proved by witne&s;&s;es, that not only during her fir&s;t marriage and widow|hood, her character had been unimpeached, notwith&s;tanding her youth, and the uncommon attractions of her per&s;on; but that &s;ince &s;he had been connected with the chevalier de Vil|liers, it had been &s;o irreproachable, that ma|lice it&s;elf had never dared to throw on it the &s;lighte&s;t reflection. The be&s;t proof, that the chevalier him&s;elf was as much attached to her from the conviction of her virtue and good|ne&s;s, as by her per&s;onal beauty, was, the ea|gerne&s;s with which he &s;ought to confirm, or to renew, a marriage which he preferred to all the &s;atisfaction a great fortune could be&s;tow; and was content to be cut off from his family, and lo&s;e his inheritance, rather than abandon a wife &s;o worthy of his tenderne&s;s and con|&s;tancy. Had not the excellent character and numerous virtues of his wife &s;ecured the heart her eminent beauty fir&s;t attracted, it was probable, that a young man, after a three years marriage, would willingly avail him&s;elf of the opportunity he now had to recover his liberty, and reconcile him&s;elf to his father. The conduct of the chevalier de Villiers was the be&s;t eulogy on the merit of his wife.</P>
<P>The charge of &s;eduction, the mo&s;t dan|gerous of all the allegations again&s;t Julie de Lalande, the widow of the &s;ieur Geoffroi, alone remained to be controverted. The plaintiffs
<PB N="99" REF="036316_0099_1008D93508D6F850">
had a&s;&s;erted, that being a widow, and older than the chevalier de Villiers, and being be|&s;ides a&s;&s;i&s;ted in her enterprize by her father, and her late hu&s;band's mother, &s;he had art|fully inveigled the chevalier into a clande&s;tine marriage; who was, from his inexperience and youth, liable to fall into the &s;nare. But the facts were here greatly mi&s;repre&s;ented. In regard to age, the chevalier was only three months younger than madame Geoffroi; and in point of experience, it is inconceivable that a young man, who had been two years a mou&s;quetaire, as long aid de camp to mar&s;hal Bouff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ers, and three years a captain of hor&s;e, &s;hould be without knowledge of the world, and unable to di&s;cover the artful practices of the defendants, had any &s;uch been u&s;ed; yet he is repre&s;ented as a novice, without judg|ment, and incapable of conducting him&s;elf.</P>
<P>And why &s;hould madame Geoffroi wi&s;h to engage the chevalier Villiers, had not a mu|tual affection bound them to each other? She lived ea&s;y and re&s;pected with her mother-in-law; &s;he was young, beautiful, and con&s;e|quently much followed and admired, and had among her lovers &s;everal of e&s;tabli&s;hed fortune, and of higher rank; with whom &s;he would not have experienced the inconveniences and per&s;ecutions to which her pre&s;ent union had expo&s;ed her. Her pro&s;pects of fortune from her father were at lea&s;t equal to tho&s;e of the chevalier de Villiers; and, being born a gen|tlewoman,
<PB N="100" REF="036316_0100_100895B68ABE0BB8">
&s;he might ju&s;tly a&s;pire to an union wi&s;h a man of family; why, therefore, &s;hould the chevalier Villiers be an object to her, and what &s;hould attach her to him, but that di&s;|intere&s;ted and &s;incere affection, which induce her to prefer him to the re&s;t of mankind, and even to her own peace and convenience?&mdash;The charge of &s;eduction, brought again&s;t the &s;ieur de Lalande, her father, was equally ground|le&s;s. He was at fir&s;t ignorant of the mar|riage; and, when he was informed of it, ex|pre&s;&s;ed what he really felt, anger and indig|nation, fore&s;eeing all the ill con&s;equences of &s;uch an indi&s;creet connection. But the ho|nour of his daughter, and the welfare of his grand&s;on obliged him, &s;ince the thing was done, to receive his daughter, and to endea|vour to have her marriage confirmed. He is accu&s;ed of keeping the chevalier de Villiers always with him, and by that means depriv|ing him of the freedom of choice. That a&s;|&s;ertion is contradicted by the notorious fact of the chevalier's having made two campaigns &s;ince his marriage, when he was many months ab&s;ent from his wife and her family. On his return to winter at home, he pre&s;ented him|&s;elf at his father's hou&s;e; he was refu&s;ed ad|mi&s;&s;ion; it was then natural for him to go where his wife and child were, and to make his abode with the &s;ieur de Lalande. In fact, he had, during his minority, neither home or &s;upport but with his wife; &s;ince he attained
<PB N="101" REF="036316_0101_1008D9368EC5A978">
his majority, he had removed from the hou&s;e of his wife's father: the idea therefore, of his being under guidance or influence, was wholly unfounded. It was al&s;o &s;aid, that the &s;ieur de Lalande had impre&s;&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ars on the mind of the chevalier de Villier<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. He did indeed fear&mdash;but what?&mdash;he feared to become perjured and faithle&s;s; to act again&s;t his con|&s;cience, again&s;t the laws of nature and huma|nity; again&s;t the peace and honour of a vir|tuous and innocent woman, and a child who claimed all his tenderne&s;s and protection.&mdash;The&s;e crimes he certainly was afraid to com|mit; and the fear of &s;uch guilt was &s;o great, that he lo&s;t the le&s;&s;er fear of being di&s;inherited, though the con&s;equence were to be the lo&s;s of a &s;plendid fortune, and, what he valued more, his father's favour. However flattering it would be to him to po&s;&s;e&s;s both, he could not do it by an act which would make him guilty and unworthy in his own eyes, and in tho&s;e of every man of honour; his hope there|fore was, that in his profe&s;&s;ion he might ac|quire that fortune which he would not owe to perjury and inju&s;tice, and that his &s;word would be the means of repairing the inju&s;tice of his father: and, if he mu&s;t choo&s;e between po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing un&s;tained the honour of his wife, his child, and him&s;elf, though in the lowe&s;t indigence; or of forfeiting it all to become the heir to his father's fortune, and to be re|&s;tored to his favour; he preferred poverty, en|dured

If, however, &s;eduction could be proved on the part of the lady, it is a crime &s;o heinous, that the parents would be ju&s;tified in their refu&s;al to con&s;ent to the marriage, and the law would maintain them in it; but nothing had been alleged which could fix that imputation on <HI>her.</HI> Between two per&s;ons &s;o nearly of the &s;ame age, love was the &s;educer of both; and

with a per&s;on &s;o calculated to in&s;pire it, with temper and talents &s;o likely to fix it, there was no need of &s;eduction. But her fa|ther, the &s;ieur de Lalande, was not equally clear from this charge; for though it appeared that he was not at Metz when the connection began, yet it was clear, that as &s;oon as he was appri&s;ed of his daughter's &s;ituation, he tried by every means in his power to make the chevalier de Villiers adhere to his en|gagements. In doing &s;o he had acted like a father anxious for the honour of his child. But there &s;till was an appearance of con&s;traint; the chevalier had lived with him during his minority; and immediately on its expiration, and before he could be &s;aid to be out of the influence of the &s;ieur de Lalande, this cau&s;e had come on. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, the &s;olicitor general propo&s;ed, that the chevalier de Villiers &s;hould be obliged to return to his family for a certain time, in order that it &s;hould be en|tirely out of the power of the &s;ieur de Lalande to affect his judgment; after which, if he &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in u&s;ing his right to marry Julia de Lalande, it &s;hould not be denied him. In regard to the danger he might incur in the en&s;uing campaign, as he had already returned &s;afe, it was probable he might do &s;o again; at lea&s;t the hazard mu&s;t be incurred, where the rights of paternal authority, and the good order of &s;ociety, were in que&s;tion. Though the &s;olicitor general &s;eemed by this &s;peech to
<PB REF="036316_0106_1008D8F85DE8FB80">
act as a moderator, it appears probable, from the clo&s;e of it, that he was influenced by the parents of the chevalier de Villiers; who hoped if he could detach their &s;on from the family of his wife, they &s;hould prevail on him to give up a connection &s;o contrary to their views&mdash;But the judges were not, in their &s;entence, guided by the opinion of the &s;oli|citor general. Their &s;entence was to this ef|fect&mdash;That the marriage contracted between the chevalier Villiers, and the widow Geoffroi, was null and invalid; but that &s;he was cleared from all charge of &s;eduction; and that he was at liberty, being now of age, to contract marriage with her, due regard being paid to the requi&s;ite forms; and the parents mu&s;t withdraw their oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The relation of this cau&s;e appears defec|tive; not only in the confu&s;ed manner in which the parties are indi&s;criminately called the &s;ieur de Villiers, without duly di&s;tingui&s;h|ing the father from the &s;on, but in the ob&s;curity of the recital, which &s;ays, that the &s;ieur de Villiers (who, for di&s;tinction &s;ake, is here called the chevalier) was married at the age of twenty-two&mdash;and, after three years, claimed, as he was major, his right to affirm or to re|new his marriage. He could then be only twenty-five. Yet the laws of France fix the majority of a woman at twenty-five; and that

of a man at thirty years old&mdash;till which time they cannot marry without the con&s;ent of both their parents.</P>

<HEAD>THE BEGGAR OF VERNON.</HEAD>
<P>ON the 6th of May 1640, Jane Vachero<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was married to Launcelot le Moine, a notary of the Chatelet at Paris; in 1645, Launcelot le Moine made his will, in which he named his wife the &s;ole guardian of his three &s;ons, Peter, James, and Louis, and died in January 1649. His will was confirmed by the &s;enate of the Chatelet. The mother be|came guardian of the boys, to whom &s;he gave &s;uch an education as was &s;uitable to their cir|cum&s;tances. She &s;ent them to &s;uch &s;chools as in&s;truct children in reading, writing, and the rudiments of the Latin tongue. She had &s;everal farms in the neighbourhood of Vernon; and, as there were con&s;iderable arrears of rent due from her tenants, and other affairs which required her pre&s;ence, &s;he went thither in September 1654, carrying her younge&s;t &s;on, Louis, with her, and leaving the other two, Peter, who was about fourteen, and James, who was about ten, under the care of her mother and a female &s;ervant. While their
<PB N="109" REF="036316_0109_1008D942592B5818">
mother was ab&s;ent, the&s;e two boys, weary of re&s;traint, ran away, no one knew whithe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, ac|companied by the &s;ons of another trade&s;man named Coutard. The children of Coutard were met with by an extempt of the grand provo&s;t, who brought them back to their fa|ther; but of the children of madame le Moine, no intelligence could be gained. The un|happy mother, overwhelmed with grief and con&s;ternation, flew from place to place, in|treating every body &s;he met to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in finding her children. Wherever &s;he went the idea of her lo&s;t boys followed her; and to find them appeared the fir&s;t wi&s;h of her heart. In this di&s;po&s;ition &s;he pa&s;&s;ed one day by the Hotel Dieu, and ob&s;erved fitting on the &s;teps, a beggar, whom &s;he had often &s;een a&s;k|ing charity, in the &s;ame place. His child was with him, and a likene&s;s between this child and her &s;econd &s;on, James le Moine, imme|diately &s;truck her. She approached and ex|amined the lad more nearly, and found that though there was &s;ome re&s;emblance, he was not &s;o very like her &s;on as &s;he had at fir&s;t imagined. She gave &s;ome relief to the beggar, and be&s;ought him to enquire, wherever he went, for her children: &s;he de&s;cribed the marks by which they might be known, and again entreating the mendicant to attend to her reque&s;t, &s;he left him with tears, after having received from him hopes, that in the cour&s;e of his wandering he might meet with

the objects of her &s;earch. Some months pa&s;&s;ed, and every enquiry this wretched mo|ther had made was yet of no avail: &s;he there|fore went to a commi&s;&s;ary, in May 1655, and having informed him of the circum&s;tances of her lo&s;s, de&s;ired &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance as the civil power could give her.</P>
<P>In the month of July following, bu&s;ine&s;s obliged her to go again to Vernon, where &s;he little expected to become an object of public dete&s;tation and hatred, on account of tho&s;e children, who&s;e flight had almo&s;t broken her heart. On Sunday the 25th of that month, the beggar, who&s;e name was John Monrou&s;|&s;eau, whom &s;he had &s;een on the &s;teps of the Hotel Dieu, entered the town of Vernon with his boy. He placed him&s;elf, as u&s;ual, in the great church to a&s;k alms, and the re&s;emblance between this child and James le Moine, &s;truck a number of people who &s;aw him, and they, as is u&s;ual in &s;uch ca&s;es, communicated their ideas to others. It was a&s;&s;erted, however, that it originated with the &s;ieur Mordant, lieu|tenant general of the police for that town and the &s;ieur Louis, procureur du roy; and that vengeance rather than ju&s;tice, influenced their proceedings, madame le Moine having refu&s;ed to &s;ell them &s;ome parcels of land; which lay contiguous to theirs, and which they were very de&s;irous of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing. How|ever that was a notion that the little beggar was James le Moine, became univer&s;al Ma|dame
<PB N="111" REF="036316_0111_1008D9461CAD52E8">
le Moine was con&s;idered as a cruel and unnatural mother, who had, in concert with the pauper Monrou&s;&s;eau, agreed to condemn one of her children to mi&s;ery and want, for the &s;ake of aggrandizing the younge&s;t, who was &s;uppo&s;ed to be her favourite. The crowd eagerly caught the news, and a &s;ort of tumult en&s;ued as the gate of the town, where the mendicant &s;tood with his child. There the procur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> du roy appeared, and, it is &s;aid, rather excited the indignation of the people, than attempted, as he ought to have done, to educe them to rea&s;on. Monrou&s;&s;eau, the pauper, was &s;eized and hurried before the judge, who, without hearing him, in a very illegal manner &s;ent him to pri&s;on, ordered irons to be put on his fee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and that his &s;on &s;hould be taken from him and &s;ent to the ho&s;|pital. At the &s;ame time the magi&s;trate i&s;&s;ued an order for the arre&s;t of madame le Moine. One of the officers was di&s;patched for her, ac|companied by a guard. They brought the unfortunate woman by force through an im|men&s;e crowd, who lined the &s;treets, quite from her own hou&s;e to that of the judge; and the&s;e people overwhelmed her with abu&s;e, and loaded her with reproaches, &s;uch as only the mo&s;t da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">gand de&s;perate crimes could de&s;erve.

Dieu; but he a&s;&s;erted that the child was not her's but his own, by his wife Jane le Blond, the widow of a &s;hoemaker. He related all the particulars of his wife's death, and what had &s;ince happened to him. This examination being over, the child of the beggar was brought in, and confronted with madame le Moine. The child &s;aid the was his mother. She remained a whole day &s;hut up in the apartment of the judge, who u&s;ed, it is &s;aid, every me|nace and every art to force her to acknowledge that the little beggar was her &s;on, James le Moine. She continued, however, firm in her refu&s;al to a&s;&s;ert an untruth, and, as &s;oon as &s;he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, &s;he took the earlie&s;t op|portunity to fly from her per&s;ecutors, and returned to Paris. But to &s;uch a pitch had the fury of the populace by this time ri&s;en, that as &s;oon as they heard &s;he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lown, they entered her hou&s;e, and broke to pieces her gla&s;&s;es, and furniture of every kind; and had &s;he remained there, &s;he would, in all probability, have become her&s;elf the victim of their rage. A &s;uit was now commenced. The procureur du roy directed Claude le Moine, the neare&s;t relation of the children of the decea&s;ed Launcelot le Moine, to name a guardian for the &s;uppo&s;ed child; and on the 21&s;t of Augu&s;t the judge gave &s;entence, that the child &s;hould have a provi&s;ion a&s;&s;igned him of an hundred livres. Madame le Moine appealed, and obtained a &s;entence, whereby
<PB N="113" REF="036316_0113_1008D9490FC385C0">
all proceedings were &s;topped till the cau&s;e could be heard before the parliament of Paris. But Vernon being in the juri&s;diction of the parliament of Normandy, the judge would not attend to the decree, but proceeded to force from the tenants of madame le Moine, the &s;um he had awarded as a &s;upport for the &s;uppo&s;ed Jame le Moine, her &s;on. In hopes of &s;topping the&s;e proceedings, &s;he obtained a new arret, and &s;erved it on the lieutenant and procureur, in the public capacity, as well as by their private names; but they re|fu&s;ed to acknowledge the authority of the parliament of Paris. A conte&s;t now aro&s;e be|tween the&s;e two juri&s;dictions, the parliaments of Paris and of Normandy; which obliged the parties to have recour&s;e to the &s;ource of power, and carry the cau&s;e before the privy council.</P>
<P>Monrou&s;&s;eau and his child were conducted to Paris, and &s;ent to fort I'Eveque; there they were interrogated by mon&s;ieur de Lamoignon: before him the boy acknowledged Monrou&s;|&s;eau for his father. The cau&s;e was now di|rected, by the privy council, to be heard and examined by the parliament of Paris. Eight days after this la&s;t &s;entence of the privy coun|cil Peter le Moine, the elde&s;t of the children who had left their mother, returned. The younge&s;t of her three &s;ons (Louis, who had re|mained with her) was dead, and the di&s;con&s;o|late mother received her elde&s;t &s;on as a gift from Heaven; but her tran&s;ports, on &s;eeing

him &s;o unexpectedly re&s;tored to her, were checked, when &s;he found that &s;he &s;hould be|hold her &s;econd &s;on no more. Peter gave his mother an account of his unhappy travels. He told her, that when he and his brother ran away, they went to Vernon, and from thence to St. Waa&s;t, where they were obliged, having no money, to a&s;k charity; a gentleman, named Montaud, &s;aw by their manner that they were children of &s;ome creditable per&s;on: he took them to his hou&s;e, and kept them twelve days, during which time the younge&s;t of them, James le Moine, &s;ickened and died; and Peter produced a certificate, &s;igned by the curate, and the monks called the brothers of charity, &s;ignifying that his brother was buried in the burying-ground belonging to the church of St. Waa&s;t.</P>
<P>This certificate was al&s;o &s;igned by mon&s;ieur Montaud, and &s;everal inhabitants of the pari&s;h. Peter, after his brother was dead, left the pro|tection of mon&s;ieur Montaud, and had &s;ince been a wandering beggar, &s;uffering all the mi&s;eries of extreme poverty: till he determined to return, like another prodigal, to the bo&s;om of his mother, who received him as the father in &s;cripture received his repentant &s;on. At length the cau&s;e was brought to a hearing, and mr.

After opening the cau&s;e, he proceeded to ac|cu&s;e the judge and procureur of Vernon, of being the cau&s;e of the accu&s;ation made again&s;t madame le Moine; and of many illegal pro|ceedings throughout the affair. They had confined madame le Moine a whole day with|out any authority, and by irritating the popu|lace again&s;t her, had obliged her to fly like a criminal, from a place where her life was endangered. He proceeded to prove the mar|riage of his client, the birth of her children, the flight of the two elder, and the di&s;tre&s;s into which their lo&s;s threw their mother;&mdash;the means &s;he took to recover them; her application to the police for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, witne&s;&s;ed by eight per&s;ons, which evinced a &s;incere de&s;ire in madame le Moine to recover her &s;ons. He proved, by Gabriel Alexander, a writing-ma&s;ter, that both Peter and James le Moine could read and write; the boy who was now produced as James le Moine could do neither; but was buried in that profound ignorance, in which tho&s;e in his unhappy &s;tation live. He produced, on the evidence of Peter le Moine, proof that James le Moine, his brother, was dead; and the certificate of his interement put it beyond a doubt.</P>
<P>He then went on to examine the evidence of Monr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;&s;eau the pauper: What did that &s;ay? It gave a clear account of his wander|ing life. His wife Jane le Blond, the widow of a &s;hoemaker, lay-in of twins, a boy and

They then (the pauper and his wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e) went to Neuville, where they earned a precarious &s;ub&s;i&s;tence by work|ing in guardens, or in the woods; and there the woman was again delivered of twins, a boy and a girl, but the boy only &s;urvived; who&s;e bapti&s;mal regi&s;ter was produced. The man (Monrou&s;&s;eau) and his wife, afterwards went into the Limou&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n being reduced to ex|treme poverty, and to the nece&s;&s;ity of begging, they returned, after &s;ome time, towards Neuville; but on the way the woman was taken ill, and was &s;ent to the Hotel Dieu at Tours, where &s;he died. Monrou&s;&s;eau and his boy then proceeded to Paris; he related his being &s;poken to on the &s;teps of the Hotel Dieu by madame le Moine, who had lo&s;t her two children, and he repeated the conver&s;a|tion he had with her. Mon&s;ieur de Montau|ban then produced the examination of the little beggar. He &s;aid that James Monrou&s;&s;eau was his father; he related the death of his mo|ther in the Hotel Dieu at Tours; he &s;aid that he had always been accu&s;tomed to beg with his father, and that he could neither read nor write. When he was a&s;ked whether he would always beg with his father, he an|&s;wered yes, that he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, for he could not leave his father. The&s;e &s;entiments proved that he was the &s;on of Monrou&s;&s;eau. He pre|ferred his father, though poor and de&s;titute
<PB N="117" REF="036316_0117_1008D94D44059638">
of the means of &s;upporting him, to the &s;up|po&s;ed mother, though rich, and &s;urrounded with conveniencies. The mi&s;eries of cold, hunger and nakedne&s;s, to which he was born, were become habitual to him, and with his father he was content to &s;hare them. Here the voice of nature &s;poke. The interrogatory and an&s;wers of madame le Moine were next produced: anxious as &s;he was to recover her children, her heart refu&s;ed to acknowledge the &s;uppo&s;itious one; &s;he felt no emotion to per&s;uade her that it was her &s;on. A &s;light re|&s;emblance at fir&s;t attracted her towards the little beggar, but on a nearer in&s;pection &s;he found him not to be her &s;on. She &s;hed tears at the bitter recollection of her lo&s;t child, and entreated Monrou&s;&s;eau, the pauper, to enquire for him and his brother; &s;uppo&s;ing it likely, that in travelling from place to place, he might meet them. A re&s;emblance there cer|tainly was between the child madame le Moine had lo&s;t, and the child of the pauper Monrou&s;&s;eau, &s;ince it had &s;truck madame le Moine her&s;elf; but becau&s;e this boy had hair and eyes of the &s;ame colour, and &s;ome like|ne&s;s in features, it did not therefore follow that the beggar was James le Moine. In fact, their ages by no means corre&s;pond. The &s;on of Monrou&s;&s;eau was proved to be not more than eight years old; whereas the &s;on of madame le Moine would have been, had he been living, in his twelth year. Had James

Monron&s;&s;eau then &s;tolen the &s;on of madame le Moine, as beggars have been known to do? Had he taken him to excite the pity of the charitable, by intere&s;ting their feelings? No, it was his own &s;on, who has been accu&s;tomed to beg with him from his earlie&s;t infancy.</P>
<P>The people of Vernon had conceived a no|tion, that this is the child of madame le Moine; but why?&mdash;The likene&s;s at fir&s;t gave the idea, which the magi&s;trate encouraged. The com|mon people love wonders; a di&s;covery of this &s;ort is exactly &s;uited to their ta&s;te; and when fire is once laid to the train of popular preju|dice and enthu&s;ia&s;m, who &s;hall &s;ay where it will &s;top? The magi&s;trate, to gratify a pique again&s;t the widow le Moine, endeavoured to force her to acknowledge a child not her own; and would have torn from the mendicant, the only ble&s;&s;ing he had, a child whom he had brought up, and who a&s;&s;i&s;ted him to gain his mi&s;erable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.&mdash;Then, addre&s;&s;ing him|&s;elf to the parliament, mon&s;ieur de Montau|ban exclaimed, <Q>Gentlemen, puni&s;h the&s;e iniquitous judges&mdash;give back the child to his father &mdash; let the unhappy mother de|plore at liberty the death of the child we cannot re&s;tore to her.

<HEAD>THE COUNT DE ST. GERAN.</HEAD>
<P>THE mar&s;hal de St. Geran, of the noble hou&s;e of De la Guiche, was fir&s;t married to mademoi&s;elle de Tournon, by whom he had a &s;on, Claude de la Guiche, count de St. Geran; and a daughter, married to the mar|quis de Bouill&eacute;. His &s;econd was Su&s;annah aux Epaules, the widow of the count de Lon|quenay, to whom &s;he had borne a daughter, Su&s;annah de Lonquenay. This marriage be|tween the mar&s;hal de St. Geran and madame de Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">quenay produced another. The count his &s;on married mademoi&s;elle de Lonquenay, the daughter of his mother-in-law, which marriage took place at Rouen, in 1619. The young count was about eighteen, and the lady between thirteen and fourteen; and the extreme youth of the parties made their friends think it expedient for the count to travel into Italy, where he continued <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ear two years.</P>
<P>The mar&s;hal de St. Geran, during the
<PB REF="036316_0127_1008D95B44D06430">
thirteen years he &s;urvived this marriage, &s;aw with regret that it produced no children and to his death which happened in 1632, he la|mented that this branch of the noble hou&s;e of which he was the principal, was likely to be extinct in his &s;on. He left, by his &s;econd lady, two daughters.</P>
<P>On his decea&s;e, the count de St. Geran &s;ucceeded him in his government of the Bour|bonnois; and the king gave him the ribands of tho&s;e orders with which his father had been honoured.</P>
<P>For many years after this period the count and counte&s;s of St. Geran continued without children; but at length, in 1640, the coun|te&s;s became pregnant; a circum&s;tance that gave the greate&s;t joy to her mother, the mar|&s;hale&s;s, and to all who were attached to the family of de la Guiche. This plea&s;ing ex|pectation was however in &s;ome ri&s;k of being di&s;appointed, by a fall which the counte&s;s had in her &s;eventh month. On this occa&s;ion all the ladies related to the family, women of the fir&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ank attended repeatedly on the counte&s;s de St. Geran; and they had the &s;atisfaction to find, that, by care the ill effects of the accident &s;he had met with were prevented, and that &s;he was likely to go on &s;afely till the time of her delivery. The count, however, engageda <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and midwife to be at hand till that pe|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">; and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> her&s;elf arrived at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the expected hour;

and brought with her as pre&s;ents the mo&s;t &s;uperb linen and nece&s;&s;aries &s;he could purcha&s;e, for the infant &s;o ardently de&s;ired.</P>
<P>But at the ca&s;tle of St. Geran were al&s;o two per&s;ons, who, influenced by the mo&s;t cruel avarice, contrived to render all their preparations u&s;ele&s;s; to deprive the parents of the object of their tender &s;olicitude, and fru&s;|trate the hopes of tho&s;e who were intere&s;ted in beholding an heir to the virtues and e&s;tate of the count de St. Geran, The marchione&s;s de Bouill&eacute; was &s;i&s;ter, by the &s;ame mother, to the count; &s;he had been early married to the marquis de Bouill&eacute;, who was &s;eventy years of age. The di&s;parity of their years was probably the real occa&s;ion of their parting, not long after their marriage; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ugh the mar|chione&s;s pretended many cau&s;es of complaint again&s;t him. They had now lived &s;eparate &s;ome time, and madame de Bouill&eacute; u&s;ually re&s;ided with her brother; &s;he was young, lively and agreeable; and had her brother died with|out children, would have been heire&s;s to all the exten&s;ive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the family of de la Guiche. The ca&s;tle of St. Geran was an a&s;ylum al&s;o to the marquis de St. Maixant, a man who&s;e addre&s;s and talents found a patron in the count de St. Geran, who in the mi&s;|fortunes of the marquis &s;eemed to have for|gotten his crimes and his errors. It is a&s;to|ni&s;hing that m. de St. Geran &s;hould &s;uffer my con&s;ideration to induce him to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">

man of &s;o abandoned a character as St. Maix|ant; who had been accu&s;ed of having occa|&s;ioned the death of his wife, in hopes of mar|rying another woman, the life of who&s;e hu&s;|band he had al&s;o attempted. He had been &s;u&s;pected of coining, and other atrocious ac|tions, for &s;ome of which he had fallen into the hands of ju&s;tice; but he e&s;caped from the marechau&s;&s;e of Auvergne, and had found &s;e|curity in the protection of count de St. Geran. The marquis St. Maixant concealed the ba&s;|e&s;t di&s;po&s;ition, and mo&s;t abandoned principles, under elegant manners and agreeable talents. His per&s;on too was hand&s;ome, and his addre&s;s in&s;inuating; and le&s;s exterior advantages than he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, would probably have been &s;uffi|cient to recommend him to the notice of ma|dame de Bouill&eacute;.

That impediment once removed, he found that he might become the hu&s;band of madame de Bouille, who but for the expected infant was heire&s;s to property which would not only re&s;tore his ruined for|tune, but rai&s;e him to a rank that would by its &s;plendor vani&s;h his crimes, or even give

With the&s;e hopes, and with talents calculated to plea&s;e, he &s;oon po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of the heart of the marchione&s;s; and her con&s;cience became wholly at his di&s;|po&s;al.

<P>The midwife, Loui&s;a Goillard, the two women immediately attending the per&s;on of the counte&s;s St. Geran, who were &s;i&s;ters of the name of Quinet; and the maitre d'hotel, called Beaulieu; were engaged by St. Maixant and madame de Bouill&eacute; in this cruel con&s;pi|racy, and, by dint of pre&s;ents, and promi&s;es of boundle&s;e reward, entered into the inhu|man de&s;ign of robbing the count and counte&s;s of their child.

She therefore be&s;ought the mar|&s;hale&s;s to order every body to retire; and, that nobody might think &s;uch an order unkind, that &s;he would her&s;elf &s;et the example. To this the mar&s;hale&s;s con&s;ented, madame de Bouill&eacute; undertaking to &s;tay with the counte&s;s, and give from time to time information of the &s;ituation &s;he was in to the re&s;t of the family.

She gave her therefore to drink a mixture &s;he had prepared, which threw her almo&s;t immediately into total in&s;en&s;ibility; and in that &s;tate &s;he continued till the next morn|ing. During the night the count and the mar&s;hale&s;s &s;ent continually to the door to enquire after her; and the intelligence which was always given by madame de Bouill&eacute;

was, that all was going on well. The dome&s;tics were not &s;uffered to enter the room, but received the an&s;wers at the door; where it was ob&s;erved that St. Maixant continually attended, with tho&s;e marks of &s;olicitude and unea&s;ine&s;s &s;o natural to the &s;tate of mind he mu&s;t have been in, while the &s;ucce&s;s of his execrable plot was precarious. The unfortu|nate counte&s;s, now left in the hands of the cruel woman who&s;e intere&s;t it was to deprive her of her child, was delivered of a &s;on, while totally uncon&s;cious of his birth, the draught given her by the midwife having reduced her to a &s;tate &s;o nearly re&s;embling death, that &s;he no longer knew what befel her. As &s;oon as the infant was born, the midwife prepared to de&s;troy him, by cru&s;hing his head; but &s;he was prevented, either by madame de Bouill&eacute;, who could not re&s;olve to mur|der the innocent creature, or by Beau|lieu, the maitre d'hotel, who was now in the room, and who might have received orders from St. Maixant, or perhaps be influenced by humanity to &s;pare the life of the victim, whom they were determined to rob of every thing el&s;e: however that was, the poor little creature was not re&s;cued from the hands of the midwife, till &s;he had injured the &s;kull; a deep mark on which, left by her barbarous hands, the young count bore as long as he lived.</P>
<P>The unhappy child, thus abandoned to the

They put him into a little ba&s;ket, wrapt in a linen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oller, but not dre&s;&s;ed or even wa&s;hed. Beau|lieu took the ba&s;ket, and hiding it under his cloak, carried it down &s;tairs to a private door that opened to the fo&s;&s;&eacute; of the ca&s;tle; from thence he cro&s;&s;ed the terrace and the bridge, and made his way through a private part of the park, all the keys of which he kept. He then mounted a &s;wift hor&s;e, and rode to E&s;|cherolles, a village three miles from St. Geran, where he &s;topped at the hou&s;e of Claude Gautier, who&s;e wife gave &s;uck. He entreated the woman to give the brea&s;t to the infant he carried, which &s;he did; but not daring to re|main long in the neighbourhood of the ca&s;tle, he continued his journey immediately, and cro&s;&s;ing the river Allier, di&s;mounted with his helple&s;s charge at the hou&s;e of another man named Boucard, who&s;e wife al&s;o gave &s;uck to the child; after which, entering A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vergne, he pur&s;ued his way; but the heat was ex|ce&s;&s;ive, and the hor&s;e &s;o fatigued, that he could with difficulty get him on.

to Riom, he agreed with this man to carry the child to a certain di&s;tance in his waggon; and getting in him&s;elf took it in his arms, and tied his hor&s;e behind. As they went along, the carrier entered into di&s;cour&s;e with him; and, in the cour&s;e of their conver&s;a|tion, Beaulieu told the carrier that he was &s;o careful of the child becau&s;e he belonged to the noble&s;t family of the Bourbonnois.

The counte&s;s, who had the mo&s;t convincing proofs that the birth had already taken place, could not be pacified; &s;he wept, &s;he implored them to tell her what was become of her child; but they hardened their hearts again&s;t her tears and anxiety, and continued
<PB N="136" REF="036316_0136_100895B4AB5FFD18">
to endeavour to per&s;uade her, that her delivery was only delayed. The midwife artfully de|clared, that &s;uch delays very frequently oc|curred in her practice; and by her arguments gained the belief of the mar&s;hale&s;s, who the more ea&s;ily credited the a&s;&s;ertion, as &s;he recol|lected that with one of her children &s;he had gone &s;ix weeks, after having all the &s;ymptoms of an immediate delivery. The mention of a circum&s;tance &s;o favourable to their project, was eagerly caught at, and ince&s;&s;antly repeated by madame de Bouill&eacute; and her confidants. But the counte&s;s could not be per&s;uaded, but that &s;he had lo&s;t her child. She felt too great an alteration to doubt for a moment of the fact; and her angui&s;h was not to be de&s;cribed, when &s;he found the whole family per&s;i&s;ted in refu&s;ing to believe her, and to look forward to a future day for the birth of the infant &s;o ardently de|&s;ired. The midwife ob&s;tinately in&s;i&s;ted on the truth of her a&s;&s;ertion, the counte&s;s as determi|nately adhered to hers, and her tears and de&s;|pair appeared &s;o dangerous to the confederates, that the midwife, fearful that nature and truth would unveil the cruel my&s;tery, endeavoured to put an end to the life of the counte&s;s. Af|ter &s;ome days, &s;he per&s;uaded her, that if &s;he were to go into a carriage, and be driven over rough ground, it would bring on the labour. The counte&s;s, who was weak and exhau&s;ted, would not con&s;ent to undergo this fatiguing and dangerous experiment; but the count

and the mar&s;hale&s;s be&s;ought her to attempt it. To &s;atisfy them &s;he con&s;ented, all unable as &s;he was, and being carried to her coach, was violently driven over ploughed grounds, and along the roughe&s;t roads that could be cho&s;en in the neighbourhood of St. Geran. After undergoing this cruel experiment for two hours, &s;he was brought home, fainting, and put again into her bed, whence her inhuman per&s;ecutors hoped &s;he would ari&s;e no more. But the &s;trength of her con&s;titution prevented her &s;inking under the means u&s;ed to deprive her of life. She began, though very &s;lowly, to recover her health; but the conviction of her having lo&s;t her infant was every day &s;trengthened. Nobody &s;u&s;pected &s;uch a crime as had been committed; and at length as time advanced, and no delivery took place, every one began to &s;uppo&s;e &s;he had been de|ceived, as has &s;o often happened to others, by &s;ymptoms re&s;embling pregnancy, and by &s;o much wi&s;hing to find it &s;o. This opinion gained univer&s;al belief; but the counte&s;s was not to be &s;o argued out of her &s;en&s;es&mdash;till, finding that nobody attended to her complaints, but imputed them to her fondne&s;s for an il|lu&s;ion &s;o flattering to her wi&s;hes, &s;he tried to cea&s;e &s;peaking of what was deeply engraven on her heart, and, &s;ince &s;he &s;aw no remedy, to forbear to complain:&mdash;&s;till however per|&s;uaded that &s;he had borne a child, her grief and melancholy often got the better of her re|&s;olution

not to afflict the count by renewing the memory of their di&s;appointment; but, after &s;ome months had elap&s;ed, the&s;e bur&s;ts of affliction became le&s;s violent; till a &s;ingular circum&s;tance again awakened the recollection of what had happened, together with &s;u&s;picion of its cau&s;e. While this interval pa&s;&s;ed, we will return to trace the fate of the child thus vainly lamented by its mother.</P>
<P>Beaulieu had a brother, who had been a fencing-ma&s;ter at Paris, and who died, about two years before this period, in great poverty, leaving his wife, the daughter of an actor, who&s;e name was Mary Pigoreau, in wretched circum&s;tances: to the care of this woman Beaulieu determined to give the child, who was very glad to undertake it; two thou&s;and livres being left in the hands of de Raguenet, a grocer, at Paris, which he was from time to time to pay her, without knowing, or proba|bly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">quiring, for what.</P>
<P>La Pigoreau bought for the infant, every nece&s;&s;ary that is furni&s;hed for a child of fa&s;hion, and took the greate&s;t care of him. She procured him a nur&s;e at Jorcy en Brie, who&s;e name was Paillard, and with whom &s;he was intimate. This woman, after &s;uckling him a &s;hort time, was taken ill, and gave no|tice to La Pigoreau, that &s;he might get ano|ther nur&s;e; la Pigorea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> expre&s;&s;ed her concern to her, &s;aying it was a pity &s;he lo&s;t &s;o good a chance o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> making her fortune, for that the

little boy belonged to a great nobleman, who one day or other would reward tho&s;e who brought him up. As another nur&s;e, however, was to be found, la Pigoreau put him to a woman in the &s;ame village, who was lately a widow, and who&s;e name was Sequin. To this woman &s;he al&s;o &s;aid, that he was the &s;on of a great lord, who was able to make her a rich woman. In con&s;equence of this report, and of the woman's being regularly paid every month, great care was taken of the young count; who was at the age of eighteen months, fetched by la Pigoreau from this wet-nur&s;e, and weaned. La Pigoreau had been mother of two &s;ons, the elde&s;t called Anthony, the younge&s;t, born after his father's death, called Henry, who u&s;ed when only a few months old. Had this younge&s;t &s;on been liv|ing, he would have been three years older than the young count; but when la Pigoreau brought him to her hou&s;e, &s;he pretended he was her la&s;t child, Henry, by this means re|doubling the my&s;tery or his birth, and putting an end to all enquiries&mdash;for, that nobody might remark the age of the child, who knew that her younge&s;t by her hu&s;band mu&s;t be much older, &s;he di&s;charged her lodgings, took leave of her acquaintance, as if going into the country, and went to another part of Paris, where &s;he produced the little count as her younge&s;t &s;on.</P>
<P>Whether it was by agreement between La
<PB N="140" REF="036316_0140_1008D92A44D3A050">
Pigoreau and Beaulieu, or whether the money was no longer &s;o punctually paid, which made her weary of her charge, is uncertain; but at two years and a half old &s;he carried the child to Beaulieu, who was then at Paris with the count and counte&s;s, &s;aying, that &s;he was no longer able to maintain both her children, and that as Beaulieu was their father's brother, and having &s;o good a place, was in a &s;ituation to help her, he mu&s;t take the younge&s;t. To this Beaulieu agreed, and a&s;ked leave of his lord and lady (who were extremely kind to him) to take the child into the Hotel de St. Geran. The counte&s;s told him he was wel|come, but at the &s;ame time repre&s;ented to him how little he could afford to burden him|&s;elf with any additional charge, who had five children of his own. His wife, too, was ex|tremely chagrined, to find he meant to under|take to provide for his nephew; but he an|&s;wered, that if his lord and lady would &s;uffer the little boy to be at their hotel, he would be very little expen&s;e to him; and the count and counte&s;s with their u&s;ual goodne&s;s, con&s;ented to indulge him. La Pigoreau had often been heard to &s;ay, &s;he was in no pain about the fate of her younge&s;t &s;on, who was &s;ure of be|ing provided for; &s;ome of her neighbours therefore repre&s;ented to her, that &s;ince &s;he was certain of an e&s;tabli&s;hment for one of them, &s;he had better avail her&s;elf of it for Anthony, the elde&s;t, who was a plain coar&s;e

<P>The child therefore was brought to the Ho|tel de St. Geran, ju&s;t as the counte&s;s and her &s;uite were getting into the carriages, which were to carry them from Paris to Moulins; &s;he bid them put the little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o the coach behind hers, where her women were; his &s;uppo&s;ed uncle led him along in order to do &s;o, near the counte&s;s, who was &s;tepping into her own coach.

not determine to part with him: &s;he ordered him to remain in her own apartments, and to be attended by her own women; and her attach|ment to him hourly encrea&s;ed. The count was almo&s;t as fond of him as his lady; and the little boy, as if attracted towards them by the force of blood, was never &s;o happy as when they allowed him to play round them, and return their fondne&s;s. In all his little di&s;tre&s;&s;es he &s;ought &s;helter in their arms, and every hour their mutual affection increa&s;ed. The counte&s;s often looked on him till her eyes were filled with tears, and &s;he would &s;igh and &s;ay&mdash;Alas! had the dear babe lived, whom I thought to have called mine, it would have been ju&s;t the age of this, and perhaps as lovely and as engaging!</P>
<P>The marquis de St. Maixant, and the marchione&s;s de Bouill&eacute; were very much alarmed, when they found that Beaulieu had placed the child &s;o near his parents; yet they dared not u&s;e any means to &s;eparate them, as their interference in &s;uch an affair would only have awaked tho&s;e &s;u&s;picions they were &s;o de|&s;irous of evading.</P>
<P>Beaulieu, who had been &s;educed by hopes of &s;uddenly enriching his family by the re|wards promi&s;ed him, which a long cour&s;e of &s;ervice could do but &s;lowly, now &s;aw the fallacy of tho&s;e vi&s;ionary pro&s;pects with which he had been mi&s;led, and remor&s;e of con&s;cience pur&s;ued him, from which he found no re&s;pite.
<PB N="143" REF="036316_0143_1008D970E05C4570">
To reveal the crime he had committed, would have been the mo&s;t immediate remedy; but the fear of St. Maixant, and the dread of his ma&s;ter's re&s;entment, prevented this from time to time; though the angui&s;h of his &s;oul would not &s;uffer him to remain wholly &s;ilent. He was &s;ometimes heard to &s;ay, that the honour and the life of madame de Bouill&eacute; were in his hands; &s;ometimes, that the count and count|e&s;s had more rea&s;on to love little Henry than they were aware of; and to his confe&s;&s;or he propo&s;ed this que&s;tion&mdash;Whether a man, having a&s;&s;i&s;ted to &s;ecrete a child from its pa|rents, was exculpated from guilt, if he after|wards re&s;tored their child to them as the child of a &s;tranger, and did not reveal the my&s;tery? It is probable that the an&s;wer given by the confe&s;&s;or did not calm tho&s;e &s;cruples, which &s;till &s;eemed to hang heavy on Beaulieu's heart, &s;ince he often appeared under great agitation and ab&s;ence of mind; and once, when a per&s;on at Moulins congratulated him on the affection which his lord and lady &s;hewed to his nephew, he ha&s;tily an&s;wered, that it was natural enough, for that he was nearly related to them. The&s;e words, and many others of the &s;ame tendency, &s;eemed to e&s;|cape him in &s;pite of him&s;elf, and perhaps were the re&s;ult of the perpetual combat be|tween his con&s;cience and his fear.</P>
<P>St. Maixant, who lived in continual dread of detection, now began to apprehend, that,
<PB N="144" REF="036316_0144_1008D92E679AF250">
long ere he &s;hould be able to reap the fruits of his crime, the remor&s;e of Beaulieu would not only render it ineffectual, but plunge him into all the horrors of tho&s;e puni&s;hments he had &s;o well de&s;erved. He was not of a tem|per, after having gone &s;o far, to leave any thing undone, and therefore determined to take away by poi&s;on the life of the man who daily &s;ubjected his to hazard. Beaulieu fell into a di&s;order, which put an end to his life in a few days; but which fir&s;t &s;eemed to have affected his rea&s;on. He raved of the injury he had done his lord and lady, and be&s;ought them to forgive him: while they, &s;uppo&s;ing him delirious, fearful of ha&s;tening his death by enquiry, and be&s;ides &s;u&s;pecting nothing of the real meaning of his words, endeavoured only to have him kept calm; and he died without revealing the &s;ecret which burdened his heart.</P>
<P>The little Henry, notwith&s;tanding the death of his &s;uppo&s;ed uncle, &s;till continued to be the favourite of the count and counte&s;s, who pro|cured for him ma&s;ters of all &s;orts, and at|tended them&s;elves to the cultivation of his un|der&s;tanding and the regulation of his morals. When he was &s;even years old, they dre&s;&s;ed him in a &s;ilk ve&s;t of the colour of their livery, and called him their little page; in which quality he continued to &s;erve them till the &s;e|cret of his birth was di&s;covered.</P>
<P>The &s;peeches of Beaulieu did not fail of be|ing

remembered; the &s;trange circum&s;tances which attended the counte&s;s's illne&s;s, when &s;he believed her&s;elf pregnant; and the &s;tories told by the nur&s;es; all the&s;e things had made their impre&s;&s;ion, and numberle&s;s reports ran among the common people.

<P>About the &s;ame time, the count being ill, went to Vichi, where the midwife then lived, to drink the waters.

<P>The mi&s;eries of con&s;cious guilt had long &s;ince taught her, how much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;atisfaction &s;he had &s;acrificed to the chimerical hope of mar|rying the artful and unworthy man who had won her heart.

Though &s;he &s;ent them from her hou&s;e, &s;he was &s;till obliged, from time to time, to re|new the purcha&s;e of their &s;ecrecy, by &s;ums of money; and yet lived in con&s;tant horror of their divulging the my&s;tery, which &s;he now feared could not be long concealed.</P>
<P>The reports that continually were repeated to the counte&s;s, and the circum&s;tance of the conference held between madame de Bouill&eacute; and the midwife, at length determined her to

apply to ju&s;tice for an order to arre&s;t the midwife, and oblige her to &s;peak. After &s;everal con&s;ultations between the count, the counte&s;s, and the mar&s;hale&s;s, they agreed fir&s;t to examine the woman them&s;elves, with as little noi&s;e as po&s;&s;ible; they therefore &s;ent for her to St. Geran, where they que&s;tioned her clo&s;ely. They found that &s;he prevaricated, and contradicted her&s;elf; and in her looks and an&s;wers there appeared &s;o much of guilt and confu&s;ion, that they no longer doubted of her having com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ted &s;ome great crime, but whether it was the murder or the concealment of their infant, they could not yet tell; they heard however enough to make them adhere to their re&s;olution of arre&s;ting the midwife; but they di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her for that time, without any marks of anger, that &s;he might not be alarmed, and e&s;cape, as &s;he would probably have done, had &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed that the count would carry his enquiry farther. Immediately afterwards, they laid the com|plaint before the vice &s;enechal of Moulins; upon which the midwife was taken into cu&s;|tody, and examined before that magi&s;trate.</P>
<P>She confe&s;&s;ed that the counte&s;s the St. Ge|ran had really been delivered of a child, but &s;aid it was a daughter, &s;till-born, and that &s;he had buried it under a &s;tone &s;tep of the gra|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ary in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> yard.

<P>The mar&s;hale&s;s, enraged at the midwife's prevarication, and convinced beyond a doubt of her guilt, declared that &s;he de&s;erved death, and determined to leave no effort untried to bring her to ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of this determination, proper officers of the law proceeded again&s;t the mid|wife, Loui&s;a Goillard. On her &s;econd ex|amination, &s;he &s;aid that the counte&s;s de St. Geran had not been delivered; in the third examination, that &s;he had brought forth a mole&mdash;and in a fourth, that &s;he had borne a &s;on, which had been &s;ecreted by Beaulieu, and carried away in a ba&s;ket: And in the fifth, when &s;he was put to the bar, and a|gain clo&s;ely interrogated, &s;he &s;aid, that it was through fear only &s;he had been driven to &s;ay that the counte&s;s had borne a child; for there was no child.

<P>But as &s;oon as &s;he found her&s;elf arre&s;ted, &s;he &s;ent her &s;on to madame de Bouill&eacute;, to in|form her of what had happened. Terror and con&s;ternation immediately overwhelmed her &s;he the moment at hand, which &s;he had &s;o long dreaded; yet &s;till hoping to evade its con&s;equences, &s;he &s;ent a man, named La Forre&s;terie, who &s;erved her as an upper do|me&s;tic, to the lieutenant general of the police, whom &s;he had formerly employed, and who had, &s;he knew a particular enmity to her brother, the count de St. Geran. She de&s;ired he would advi&s;e her how to a&s;&s;i&s;t Goillard the midwife, without appearing in it. He re|commended it to her, to &s;top the proceedings by obtaining an arret.

Enabled, by their fortune and thir power, to contract whatever mea&s;ures were taken by the count and counte&s;s de St. Geran, to e&s;tab|li&s;h the proof of the birth of their &s;on, they undertook to &s;upport La Pigoreau, who was now to &s;ub&s;tantiate her right to the little Henry, whom &s;he undertook to prove was actually her &s;on. She had not, however, voluntarily become a party, but was fir&s;t comprehended in the accu&s;ation by the pro|ceedings of ju&s;tice. Alarmed at the attack, which threatened the wor&s;t con&s;equences, and flattering her&s;elf that through the protection of the duche&s;s de Ventadour, and the coun|te&s;s de Lude, &s;he might not only e&s;cape pu|ni&s;hment, but obtain a provi&s;ion, as a reward for the good offices &s;he could do them, &s;he readily enli&s;ted her&s;elf in their &s;ervice, and, in&s;tead of &s;hrinking from the enquiry, as a criminal, who &s;hared the guilt of the original perpetrators, &s;he prepared boldly to appear as the injured per&s;on, and to in&s;i&s;t on her ma|ternal rights being re&s;tored to her.</P>
<P>The adver&s;e party thus &s;trengthened, the cau&s;e went on with new vigour. The count de St. Geran had obtained a &s;entence of pu|ni&s;hment again&s;t Loui&s;a Goillard, the midwife.

While preparations were making for a new trial, the midwife died, without having con|fe&s;&s;ed her guilt, Her &s;on, however, being now no longer apprehen&s;ive of &s;eeing his mo|ther brought to the &s;caffold, voluntarily de|clared that he would reveal the truths her dan|ger had before obliged him to &s;mother.

He added, that &s;ince the death of the marchione&s;s de Bouill&eacute;, his mother had been &s;upported by money with which the duche&s;s de Ventadour and ma|dame de Lude had &s;upplied her, and that they had paid the lawyers who undertook her defence.</P>

have her &s;on re&s;tored to her, though &s;he had no pro&s;pect for him and her&s;elf but poverty and ob&s;curity. They pleaded, that the coun|te&s;s de St. Geran, attracted by the beauty of the boy, and extremely de&s;irous of having an heir, had dre&s;&s;ed up a detail, for which there was no foundation originally, but her chime|rical ideas, and at length rai&s;ed an idol, to whom &s;he wi&s;hed to &s;acrifice the intere&s;ts of the true heirs of the family. They in&s;i&s;ted on the doubtful proof of her having borne a child. The equivocation of the midwife made her evidence of no avail; and it was remarkable, that when the counte&s;s de St. Geran was in labour of an infant, who&s;e birth was of &s;uch con&s;equence to an illu&s;trious and ancient fa|mily, that nobody &s;hould be pre&s;ent, who would &s;wear to the fact of the birth; and above all, that the mar&s;hale&s;s, who was &s;o particularly intere&s;ted in the event, and who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rom her age and experience, as well as her affection, ought to have attended, was not only out of the room at the time, but after all ap|pearance of pregnancy had cea&s;ed, was con|tent to let the enquiry drop, and to allow that the whole was a vi&s;ionary hope originating in the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent wi&s;hes of the counte&s;s. A cir|cum&s;tance that could hardly have happened, had the mar&s;hale&s;s been thoroughly per&s;uaded that the counte&s;s was really pregnant; for in that ca&s;e &s;he would have undoubtedly in&s;i&s;ted on a clo&s;e enquiry than ever appears to have
<PB N="157" REF="036316_0157_1008D9855F6070B0">
been made.&mdash;This is the mo&s;t forcible part of the pleadings of one of the coun&s;el&mdash;Another &s;aid, that it might perhaps be thought unna|tural, that a mother, in circum&s;tances &s;o hum|ble as tho&s;e of La Pigoreau, &s;hould wi&s;h to deprive her &s;on of the brilliant fortune offered him, as &s;uppo&s;ed heir to a great and powerful nobleman, and compel him to return to a par|ticipation of that mi&s;ery and indigence to which he was born; but that her maternal love was &s;o &s;trong that &s;he could not re&s;olve to lo&s;e her &s;on, even to &s;ee him count de St. Geran; and were it weaker, her con&s;cience would prevent her &s;uffering him to u&s;urp honours and riches to which he had no right. As to the re&s;em|blance which the boy was allowed to bear to the count de St. Geran, this he &s;aid was no proof, &s;ince two per&s;ons frequently are very like each other, who yet are not related.</P>
<P>Thus went the pleadings on behalf of the maternity of La Pigoreau; but the ladies de Ventadour and de Lude, whether they were a&s;hamed of appearing publicly as the &s;upporters of a woman of &s;uch a character as la Pigoreau, or whether they thought that by varying the plea, they &s;hould di&s;tract the attention of the judges, and throw yet deeper ob&s;curity on the truth, determined to make their advances in a new ground; and, while they with one hand privately &s;upported la Pigoreau, with the other they held up a fal&s;e light to mi&s;lead and con|found the enquiries of that ju&s;tice they affected
<PB N="158" REF="036316_0158_1008D9D359898960">
to demand.&mdash;When fir&s;t La Pigoreau took the young count, &s;he was afraid of having him baptized, left it &s;hould occa&s;ion enquiries into his birth; but after &s;ome time, &s;he con|trived to have him privately chri&s;tened at St. John's en Greue; and the regi&s;ter was in the&s;e words:&mdash;<Q>On the 7th of March, 1642, was baptized Bernard &mdash;, the &s;on of &mdash; and of &mdash; the godfather being Maur Marmion, &s;weeper and &s;ervant in the church; and the godmother, Jane Chevalier, the widow of Peter Thibou.</Q></P>
<P>When the coun&s;el for the count and coun|te&s;s de St. Geran had proved that this regi&s;ter was made of the bapti&s;m of the infant brought to the church by La Pigoreau, it appeared that it could not relate to her younge&s;t &s;on, Henry, who was born three years before. It mu&s;t therefore belong to &s;ome other child.</P>
<P>Whereupon the coun&s;el for the ladies de Ventadour and de Lude endeavoured to prove, that it was the bapti&s;mal regi&s;ter of one Ber|nard, the illegitimate &s;on of a dancing-ma&s;ter at Paris, who&s;e &s;ub&s;equent life they pretended to trace.</P>
<P>The death of Henry Beaulieu, the younge&s;t &s;on of La Pigoreau, which they apprehended would be proved, and the certainty that proof could be brought of his being born three years before the child in que&s;tion, were probably the rea&s;ons, that induced them to have recour&s;e to a new &s;ubterfuge. And in the cour&s;e of
<PB N="159" REF="036316_0159_1008D989AC5BBA68">
the evidence it appeared, that though the re|gi&s;ter of the interment of Henry Beaulieu could not be found, yet that Pigoreau had &s;aid to many people (previous to her producing the little count as her own) that her younge&s;t &s;on was dead. But afterwards, when &s;he de|termined to call this child hers, &s;he de&s;troyed every memorial of the age as well as the death of the &s;on, who&s;e place &s;he a&s;&s;igned to the &s;tolen child.</P>
<P>After various appeals, and all the chicane of the French law had been exerted to create delays, which carried on the &s;uit till the year 1657, a hearing was again had, which la&s;ted &s;even days. An arret was given by the judge, mon&s;ieur de Me&s;mes, which ordered that the ladies de Ventadour and de Lude &s;hould with|draw from being parties in the cau&s;e, becau&s;e, during the lives of the count and counte&s;s de St. Geran, their claim was dormant, and they had no right to di&s;pute a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion which was not yet open&mdash;and La Pigoreau was ordered not to leave Paris, on pain of being declared guilty. This arret &s;till left the matter as un|decided as before. And the ladies de Ven|tadour and de Lude, now acting only through La Pigoreau, directed her to renew the &s;uit, by a requi&s;ition to the court, that all the per|&s;ons who were pre&s;ent at the pretended deli|very of the counte&s;s &s;hould be examined. This the court granted; but at the &s;ame time or|dered, that in three days La Pigoreau &s;hould
<PB N="160" REF="036316_0160_1008D9D52A242D70">
&s;urrender her&s;elf a pri&s;oner at the Concier|gerie. This order appeared &s;o alarming to La Pigoreau, that after con&s;idering &s;ome time, whether it were better to wait the event of the &s;uit, which if &s;he gained would make her fortue, but which, if &s;he lo&s;t it, would hazard her life, &s;he determined on the &s;afe&s;t method, and, leaving her patrone&s;&s;es to carry it on as well as they could, &s;he fled into Holland, and was no more heard of.</P>
<P>Her flight was a cruel blow to the intere&s;ts of the duche&s;s de Ventadour and the counte&s;s de Lude; but irritated rather than di&s;cou|raged, they continued to &s;u&s;tain the &s;uit and the count went into the Bourbonnois, to col|lect and bring to Paris all the witne&s;&s;es who were thought likely to throw new light on the affair. La Pigoreau was declared contuma|cious, and there was now every probability of an immediate termination in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">vour of the legitimacy of the young count. While the count de St. Geran was occupied in procuring &s;uch te&s;timonies as might contribute to this de&s;irable end, the king, and the queen mo|ther, in their progre&s;s from Lyons to Paris, &s;topped at his ca&s;tle. The care of paying properly his duty to them, wholly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him during their &s;tay, in which interval he had the &s;atisfaction of pre&s;enting his &s;on to his &s;overeign, under the title of the count de la Palice, and of &s;eeing him received as heir to his titles and e&s;tate. But this was the la&s;t
<PB N="161" REF="036316_0161_1008D98B44A1BAE0">
plea&s;ure this unfortunate father enjoyed. The fatigue of the entertainments made for the king, and probably anxiety about his cau&s;e, which was unavoidably delayed by his ab|&s;ence from the &s;eat of ju&s;tice, affected the count's health. A fever &s;eized him, which, after an illne&s;s of eight days, put an end to his life. He carried with him to the grave, the unhappy reflection of not having been able to e&s;tabli&s;h his &s;on in his inheritance: but in a will made during his illne&s;s, he &s;olemnly adjured the counte&s;s to per&s;evere in the proce&s;s; and named mon&s;ieur de la Bar|riere, intendant of the Bourbonnois, and the &s;ieur Vialet, trea&s;urer of France, his execu|tors, to whom he gave the like charge. He died on the 31&s;t of January, 1659, giving with his la&s;t breath his ble&s;&s;ing to his &s;on, and begging of Heaven to re&s;tore him to the right of his ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>The counte&s;s had no &s;ooner paid the la&s;t duties to his remains, and dried the tears of unavailing regret, than &s;he prepared to fulfil his injunctions, with all the anxious zeal in|&s;pired by her tenderne&s;s for her &s;on, added to her ardent de&s;ire of obeying the dying di|rections of her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>The duche&s;s de Ventadour and the coun|te&s;s de Lude, were now, by the death of the count de St. Geran, put in &s;ituations to claim their inheritence, and again to become par|ties; the proceedings therefore recommenced,
<PB N="162" REF="036316_0162_1008D9D832E0E318">
on both &s;ides, with infinitely more ardour than before.</P>
<P>The two ladies left nothing untried, to prove that the &s;uppo&s;ed birth of a child to the counte&s;s de St. Geran, was a fallacy; their coun&s;el particularly in&s;i&s;ted on the impro|bability of her having been delivered without knowing it, and the little likelihood there was that a child of &s;uch con&s;equence could be &s;to|len from the hou&s;e of his parents in the in&s;tant of his birth. But the counte&s;s de St. Geran had &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully exerted her&s;elf, and had collected &s;uch a body of pre&s;umptive evidence, the &s;ub&s;tance of who&s;e depo&s;itions has been already related, that the duche&s;s de Ventadour and madame de Lude found, that neither their addre&s;s or their riches could &s;upport them, again&s;t the force of truth; and though they contrived to lengthen the &s;uit for three years longer, final judgment was at la&s;t given again&s;t them, to this effect:</P>
<P>"That, notwith&s;tanding the letters of in|heritance which had been granted to Mary de la Guiche, duche&s;s dowager of Ventadour, &s;i&s;ter by the half blood of Claude de la Guiche, count de St. Geran; and to Eleonore da Bouill&eacute;, niece of the &s;aid count de St. Geran&mdash;they &s;hould now de&s;i&s;t from any farther claim to his e&s;tate and effects; and they were forbidden to mole&s;t or di&s;turb in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions Bernard de la Guiche, the &s;on of the &s;aid count, by Su&s;anna de Longuenay, his wife;
<PB N="163" REF="036316_0163_1008D98E5F835A30">
who was declared his &s;ole heir, and ordered to a&s;&s;ume the arms and honours of count de St. Geran.&mdash;Mary la Pigoreau, as accomplice in the concealment of the heir, was con|demned to be hanged, if &s;he could be found; if not, to be hung in effigy, and all her goods confi&s;cated."</P>
<P>Thus, after a proce&s;s of many years, and an immen&s;e expen&s;e, the young count &s;aw him&s;elf re&s;cued from ob&s;curity, and re&s;tored to his mother, as well as to his fortune and his rank.</P>
<P>He married Claudia Frances Magdalane de Varignies, the only daughter of Francis de Montevilla; but had no male heir; this branch therefore of the hou&s;e of De la Guiche became extinct at his death, which happened in his fifty-fifth year.</P>

<P>The two fir&s;t years of this marriage pro|duced a &s;on and a daughter; and madame Tiquet, if not extremely attached to her hu&s;|band, lived at lea&s;t without &s;hewing any marked di&s;like to him: but &s;he was immer&s;ed in di&s;&s;ipation; and her expen&s;es were at length &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, that Tiquet found it ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to open to her the real &s;tate of his fortune; when, to her inexpre&s;&s;ible mortification, &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound that &s;he had married a man with very little property, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> was embarra&s;&s;ed with debts, which he, had no means of paying, but with her money.

a captain in the guards, who&s;e per&s;on and manners were &s;uch as formed the mo&s;t de|cided contra&s;t to tho&s;e of the &s;ieur Tiquet. The uncommon attractions of madame Ti|quet made an immediate and deep impre&s;&s;ion on this young officer; and when the atten|tions of the lover were added to his fine figure and &s;educing manners, he became an object before whom the un&s;ub&s;tantial virtue of madame Tiquet gave way. She was not only &s;en&s;ible of a violent pa&s;&s;ion for Mon|george, but hated her hu&s;band for re&s;embling him &s;o little. And when the barrier was once broken down, &s;he &s;crupled not to give a loo&s;e to the mo&s;t deba&s;ing and &s;hameful intrigues. Mongeorge, however, was the object of her real attachment; and &s;he contrived to &s;ave ap|pearances in regard to others, with &s;o much art, that &s;he continued to be admitted into the be&s;t companies. As a connexion, &s;uch as &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between madame Tiquet and Mongeorge, has long found too much indul|gence in the di&s;&s;olute manners of the French, nobody &s;eemed to be much offended at their mutual partiality, but the hu&s;band. The jea|lou&s;y of mon&s;ieur Tiquet, which did not much &s;weeten a temper originally very bad, proved &s;o trouble&s;ome to his wife, that &s;he could no longer keep terms of decency with him; her hatred was imbittered &s;till farther on a clo&s;er in&s;ight into the condition of his fortune, which he was now reluctantly ob|liged

to give her; for his creditors, who&s;e number had greatly increa&s;ed by the expen|&s;ive pre&s;ents he had made during his court|&s;hip, grew &s;o clamorous, that he could not continue to conceal the urgency or extent of their demands. As &s;he was very much alarmed by this derangement, &s;o contrary to the expectations with which &s;he had married, &s;he applied to the proper court for a &s;eparation of their effects which was granted her, but though &s;he had thus &s;ecured her fortune from farther depredation, her hatred to her hu&s;|band augmented every day.</P>
<P>Since &s;he had known Mongeorge, with whom &s;he fancied &s;he ought to have been united, &s;he dete&s;ted her hu&s;band, for having on fal&s;e pretences betrayed her into a marriage, for which &s;he had no inclination, and which had put an eternal barrier between her and the man &s;he loved. Embittered by this mor|tifying idea, the jealou&s;y and ill-humour of her hu&s;band grew in&s;upportable; and, by continually irritating a temper naturally vio|lent, proud, and malignant, at length pro|duced the dreadful re&s;olution of relieving her|&s;elf by procuring his death. When &s;he had once formed this, d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ign, it appeared every hour more ea&s;y to execute; and &s;he thought it better to hazard the guilt, and the infamy that mu&s;t attend detection, than to continue to live with a man who made her exi&s;tence mi&s;erable. It was not long before &s;he found

wretches willing to undertake the execution of her de&s;ign. A man, named Cattelain, one of the lowe&s;t of the people; and another, who was her porter, agreed to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate Tiquet, on his return home through the &s;treets. To the&s;e ruffians &s;he gave a large &s;um of money; and they engaged in the plot others, who laid in wait for the unfortunate Tiquet, as he pa&s;&s;ed near his own door; but though &s;everal &s;hots were fired at him he e&s;caped unhurt. This di&s;appointment, and perhaps &s;ome re|mains of remor&s;e, put by the intended a&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nation for that time. Madame Tiquet gave each of her horrid agents other &s;ums of mo|ney, as the price of their &s;ecrecy, telling them that &s;he would now think no more of gratify|ing her vengeance; and a&s;&s;uring them, that the lea&s;t breach of her confidence would co&s;t them their lives. Tiquet had probably &s;u&s;pi|cions of his wife's evil intentions, and &s;aw with mi&s;tru&s;t and indignation her familiarity with the porter; whom he al&s;o &s;u&s;pected of letting in Mongeorge of a night: he therefore di&s;|charged this favoured &s;ervant, and took the keys him&s;elf. Of an evening nobody could enter or quit the hou&s;e, but by applying to him; and when he went out, as he u&s;ually did at night, to &s;up with his friends, where he often continued very late, he took the key with him; and on his return to go to bed, he placed it under his bol&s;ter. As madame Tiquet had a &s;eparate apartment they never met but

Though the hour now approached which was to con&s;ummate her guilt, and deprive her hu&s;|band of life, &s;he had &s;o far conquered her feel|ings as to appear to madame de Senonville quite unembarra&s;&s;ed and chearful. They con|tinued in conver&s;ation till it was very late; for madame de Senonville, willing to pique and incommode Tiquet, intended to &s;tay till he &s;hould be come home, and gone to bed, that &s;he might oblige him to get up again to let her out at the &s;treet-door, which he would &s;uffer nobody but him&s;elf to unlock. Tiquet &s;upped that night with madame de Villemur, who&s;e hou&s;e was near his own: he &s;taid there, as was his cu&s;tom, very late, when about the u&s;ual hour of his return home, his &s;ervants, who were waiting for him, to come in and go to bed, heard &s;everal reports of fire-arms in the &s;treet; they ran out, and found their ma&s;ter wounded and bleeding on the ground; they took him up with an intention of carry|ing him into his hou&s;e, but he had &s;trength enough to refu&s;e going thither, and directed them to take him to the hou&s;e of madame de Villemur, which he had ju&s;t left. As &s;oon as madame Tiquet knew where he was, &s;he went thither; but he ordered the people about him to prevent her entering the room he was in, and to oblige her to return home.

<P>As &s;oon as the news of this a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination reached the police, the commi&s;&s;ary of that quarter of the town attended mon&s;ieur Tiquet, to collect information: he enquired of him whom he thought likely to have thus attempted his life?&mdash;who were his enemies? "I have no enemies," an&s;wered Tiquet, "but my wife." Though madame Tiquet was apprized of this an&s;wer, and of the &s;u&s;picions that were univer&s;ally entertained of her guilt, &s;he had by this time acquired &s;o perfect a command over her&s;elf, that &s;he appeared with all the &s;erenity that con&s;cious innocence could have given her. As Tiquet was in no danger, &s;he did not affect to confine her&s;elf to her hou&s;e on his account, but went out as u&s;ual; and the very next evening waited again on the coun|te&s;s d'Aunoy. The conver&s;ation of the com|pany who were there turned naturally on the event of the preceding evening.&mdash;Madame d'Aunoy a&s;ked, "if mr.

name them. You cannot be ignorant that he throws the odium on me, and wi&s;hes it to be believed!&mdash;It is <HI>I,</HI> who am in my turn a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;inated" This &s;he uttered with the utmo&s;t compo&s;ure, though &s;he could not but read in the look of the company, that they all be|lieved her hu&s;band was right; and madame d'Aunoy &s;aid to her, that the porter ought to he &s;ecured. The opinion of her guilt now &s;o univer&s;ally prevailed, that it was determined to arre&s;t her; on her return home, notice was given her that &s;he would be committed to pri&s;on, and, &s;he was advi&s;ed to &s;ave her&s;elf by &s;light; but, relying on the &s;teadine&s;s of her agents, whom yet &s;he thought, were not known, and believing her re&s;olute and calm behaviour would convince the world of her innocence, &s;he refu&s;ed to li&s;ten to this advice. The &s;ame notice and the &s;ame remon&s;trance was re|peated by &s;everal per&s;ons who were attached to her, for &s;even or eight days, but &s;he continued &s;till to believe her&s;elf in no danger.

to Calais; from whence &s;he might get an im|mediate pa&s;&s;age to England. The infatuated woman &s;till refu&s;ed: &s;he told the theatin, that, it was for the guilty to fly, and not for her, Who was con&s;cious of her own innocence; that &s;he knew her hu&s;band was the author of the infamous calumny which accu&s;ed her of the attempt again&s;t him; and that he was even plea&s;ed with an, event, by which he hoped to frighten her away, in order to &s;eize on her fortune; but &s;he was determined, to di&s;appoint him, by not leaving her hou&s;e, be the con&s;equence as it might. She thanked and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the theatin, and re&s;olutely awaited the arrival of the officers of ju&s;tice, tru&s;ting to the mea&s;ures &s;he had taken to pre|vent the di&s;covery of the &s;econd attempt; and having long &s;ince lo&s;t all apprehen&s;ions of the con&s;equences of the fir&s;t.</P>

The lieutenant criminal then at|tempted to awaken her &s;en&s;ibility, by repre|&s;enting, in the darke&s;t colours, the horrors of that aby&s;s of infamy and di&s;grace into which &s;he was fallen. Madame Tiquet an|&s;wered, that the mo&s;t humiliating circum|&s;tance that had yet happened to her, was, &s;eeing her&s;elf deba&s;ed and degraded before <HI>him,</HI> whom &s;he had been u&s;ed to behold at her feet, the humble&s;t of her &s;laves (the lieu|tenant criminal, Deffita, had been one of her lovers).

<P>THE count of Montgomery rented part of an hotel in the R&uuml;e Royale, at Paris. The ground floor and fir&s;t floor were occupied by him; the &s;econd and third by the &s;ieur d'Anglade. The count and counte&s;s de Mont|gomery had an e&s;tabli&s;hment &s;uitable to their rank; they kept an almoner, and &s;everal male and female &s;ervants, and their hor&s;es and equipage were numerous in proportion." Mon|&s;ieurd' Anglade (who was a gentleman, though of inferior rank to the count) and his wife lived with le&s;s &s;plendor, but yet with elegance and decency &s;uitable to their &s;ituation in life. They had a carriage, and were admitted into the be&s;t companies, where probably d'An|glade increa&s;ed his income by play; but, on the &s;tricte&s;t enquiry, it did not appear that any di&s;honourable actions could be imputed to him. The count and counte&s;s de Montgo|mery lived on a footing of neighbourly ci|vility with mon&s;ieur and madame d'Anglade; and, without being very intimate, were al|ways
<PB N="185" REF="036316_0185_1008D9AF76DA4838">
ways on friendly terms. Some time in Sep|tember, 1687, the count and counte&s;s pro|po&s;ed pa&s;&s;ing a few days at Villebou&s;in, one of their country hou&s;es: they informed mon|&s;ieur and madame d'Anglade of their de&s;ign, and invited them to be of the party. They accepted it; but the evening before they were to go, they for &s;ome rea&s;on or other (probably becau&s;e madame d'Anglade was not very well begged leave to decline the ho|nour, and the count and counte&s;s &s;et out with|out them; leaving in their lodgings one of the counte&s;s's women, four girls whom &s;he employed to work for her in embroidery, and a boy who was kept to help the footman. They took with them the prie&s;t, Francis Gag|nard, who was their almoner, and all their other &s;ervants.</P>
<P>The count pretended that a &s;trange pre&s;en|timent of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pending evil hung over him, and determined him to return to Paris a day &s;ooner than he intended. Certain it is, that in|&s;tead of &s;taying till Thur&s;day, as they propo&s;ed, they came back on Wedne&s;day evening. On their coming to their hotel a few moments before their &s;ervants (who followed them on hor&s;eback), they ob&s;erved that the door of a room on the ground floor, where their men-&s;ervants &s;lep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, was a-jar, though the almoner, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> always kept the key, had double locked it when he went away. Mon&s;ieur d'Anglade, who was out when they came home, returned
<PB N="186" REF="036316_0186_1008D9FEDA73A310">
to his lodging about eleven o'clock; bring|ing with him two friends, with whom he had &s;upped at the pre&s;ident Roberts's. On enter|ing, he was told that the count and counte&s;s were returned, at which, it is &s;aid, he ap|peared much &s;urpri&s;ed. However, he went into the apartment where they were, to pay his compliments. They de&s;ired him to &s;it down, and &s;ent to beg madame, d'Anglade would join them; &s;he did &s;o, and they pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time in conver&s;ation, after which they parted. The next morning the count de Mont|gomery di&s;covered that the lock of his &s;trong box had been opened by a fal&s;e key, from whence had been taken thirteen &s;mall &s;acks, each containing a thou&s;and livres in &s;ilver; eleven thou&s;and five hundred livres in gold, being double pi&s;toles; and an hundred louis d'ors of a new coinage, called au<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">don, together with a pearl necklace <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> four thou&s;and livres.</P>
<P>The count, as &s;oon as he made this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|very, went to the police and preferred his complaint, de&s;cribing the &s;ums taken from him, and &s;pecies in which tho&s;e &s;ums were. The lieutenant of the police went di|rectly to the hotel; where, from circum|&s;tances, it clearly appeared, that the rob|bery mu&s;t have been committed by &s;ome one who belonged to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he hou&s;e. Mon|&s;ieur and madame d'Anglade earne&s;tly de|&s;ired to have their apartments and their
<PB N="187" REF="036316_0187_1008D9B390C01218">
&s;ervants examined; and, from &s;ome ob|&s;ervations he then made, or &s;ome prejudice he had before entertained again&s;t mon&s;ieur and madame d'Anglade, the lieutenant of the police &s;eems to have conceived the mo&s;t di&s;advan|tageous opinion of them, and to have been &s;o far prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with an idea of their guilt, that he did not &s;ufficiently inve&s;tigate the looks and the conduct of others. In pur&s;uance, however, of their de&s;ire to have their rooms &s;earched, he followed them thither, and looked nar|rowly into their drawers, clo&s;ets, and boxes; unmade the beds, and &s;earched the matra&s;&s;es and the pailla&s;&s;es.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Straw, clo&s;ely &s;tuffed into a coar&s;e cloth, in form of a bed, which is placed under the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE> On the floor they them|&s;elves inhabited, nothing was found: he then propo&s;ed a&s;cending to the attic &s;tory, to which mon&s;ieur d'Anglade readily con&s;ented. Ma|dame d'Anglade excu&s;ed her&s;elf from attend|ing, &s;aying that &s;he was ill and weak. How|ever her hu&s;band went up with the officer of ju&s;tice, and all was readily &s;ubmitted to his in|&s;pection. In looking into an old trunk, filled with clothes, remnants and parchments, he found a rouleau of &s;eventy louis d'ors au cordon, wrapt in a printed paper, which printed paper was a genealogical table, which the count &s;aid was his.</P>
<P>This &s;eems to have been the circum&s;tance which &s;o far confirmed the before groundle&s;s and &s;light &s;u&s;picions of the lieutenant of the
<PB N="188" REF="036316_0188_1008DA04EAEA4460">
police, that it occa&s;ioned the ruin of the&s;e un|fortunate people.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the&s;e &s;eventy louis were brought to light, the count de Montgomery in&s;i&s;ted upon it that they were his; though, as they were in common circulation, it was as impo&s;|&s;ible for him to &s;wear to <HI>them</HI> as to any other coin. He declared, however, that he had no doubt but that mon&s;ieur and madame d'Anglade had robbed him; and &s;aid that he would an|&s;wer for the hone&s;ty of all his own people; and that on this occa&s;ion he could not but re|collect that the &s;ieur Grimaudet, who had before occupied this hotel, which mon&s;ieur d'Anglade had inhabited at the &s;ame time, had lo&s;t a valuable, piece of plate. It was, there|fore, the count &s;aid, very probable that d'An|glade had been guilty of both the robberies, which had happened in the &s;ame place while he inhabited it.</P>
<P>On this rou&s;eau of &s;eventy louis d'ors, the lieutenant of the police &s;eized. He bid mon|&s;ieur d'Anglade count them; he did to, but, terrified at the imputation of guilt, and of the &s;aid con&s;equence which in France often fol|lowed the imputation only, his hand trembled as he did it; he was &s;en&s;ible of it, and &s;aid "I tremble." This emotion, &s;o natural even to innocence, appeared in the eyes of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and the lieutenant, a co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">oboration of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> guilt.

the page, and the valer de chambre were ac|cu&s;tomed to &s;leep together, in a &s;mall room. Madame d'Anglade de&s;ired the officer of the police to remark, that the door of this apart|ment had been left open, and that the valet de chambre, probably knew why; of whom therefore enquiry &s;hould be made. Nothing was more natural than this ob&s;ervation, yet to minds already prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with an opinion of the guilt of Anglade and his wife, this remark &s;eemed to confirm it; when in a cor|ner of this room, where the wall formed a little rece&s;s, five of the &s;acke were di&s;covered, which the count had lo&s;t; in each of which was a thou&s;and livres; and a &s;ixth, from which upwards of two hundred had been taken. After this, no farther enquiry was made, nor any of the &s;ervants examined, The guilt of mon&s;ieur and madame d'Anglade was a&s;certained, in the opinion of the lieute|nant of the police and the court, do Montgo|mery: and on no &s;tronger grounds than the circum&s;tance of finding the &s;eventy louis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the emotion &s;hewn by d'Anglade while he counted them and the remark made by his wife, were the&s;e unfortunate people committed to pri&s;on&punc; Their effects were &s;eized. Mon|&s;ieur d'Anglade was thrown into a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">geon in the Ch&acirc;telat; and his wife, who was with child, and her little girl, about four years old were &s;ent to fort I' E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">que&punc; while the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> orders were given that no per&s;on whatever
<PB N="190" REF="036316_0190_1008DA068C28F9E0">
&s;hould be admitted to &s;peak to them. The pro&s;ecution now commenced, and the lieute|nant of the police, who had committed the unhappy man, was to be his judge. D'An|glade appealed, and attempted to in&s;titute a &s;uit again&s;t him, and make him a party, in order to prevent his being competent to give judgment; but this attempt failed, and &s;erved only to add per&s;onal animo&s;ity to the prejudice this officer had before taken up again&s;t An|glade. Witne&s;&s;es were examined; but, far from their being heard with impartiality, their evidence was twi&s;ted to the purpo&s;es of tho&s;e, who de&s;ired to prove guilty the man they were determined to believe &s;o. The al|moner, Francis Gagnard, who was the really guilty per&s;on, was among tho&s;e who&s;e evi|dence was now, admitted again&s;t Anglade; and this wretch had effrontery enough to conceal the emotions of his &s;oul, and to perform a ma&s;s, which the count ordered to be &s;aid at St. E&s;prit, for the di&s;covery of the culprits.</P>
<P>The lieutenant of the police, elate with his triumph over the mi&s;erable pri&s;oner, pu&s;hed on the pro&s;ecution with all the avidity which malice and revenge could in&s;pire, in a vindic|tive &s;pirit. In &s;pite, however, of all he could do, the proofs again&s;t d'Anglade were &s;till in|&s;ufficient, therefore he determined to have him put to the torture, in hopes of bringing him to confe&s;s the crime. Anglade appealed, but
<PB N="191" REF="036316_0191_1008D9B805A0CFA8">
the parliament confirmed the order, and the poor man underwent the que&s;tion ordinary and extraordinary; when notwith&s;tanding his acute &s;ufferings, he continued firmly to pro|te&s;t his innocence; till covered with wounds, his limbs di&s;located, and his mind enduring yet more than his body, he was carried back to his dungeon. Di&s;grace and ruin overwhelmed him; his fortune and effects were &s;old for le&s;s than a tenth of their value, as is always the ca&s;e where law pre&s;&s;es with its iron hand; his cha|racter was bla&s;ted, his health was ruined. Not naturally robu&s;t, and always accu&s;tomed not only to the comforts, but the elegancies of life, a long confinement in a noi&s;ome and unwhole&s;ome dungeon had reduced him to the lowe&s;t &s;tate of weakne&s;s. In &s;uch a &s;ituation he was dragged forth to torture, and then plunged again into the damp and dark cavern from whence he came&mdash;without food, medi|cine, or a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any kind; though it is u&s;ual for tho&s;e who &s;uffer the torture to have medicinal help and refre&s;hment after it. This exce&s;s of &s;everity could be imputed only to the malignant influence of the officer of ju&s;tice, in who&s;e power he now was.</P>
<P>From the &s;ame influence it happened, that though the &s;ieur Anglade, amid&s;t the mo&s;t dreadful pains, had &s;teadily prote&s;ted his in|nocence&mdash;and though the evidence again&s;t him was extremely defective&mdash;&s;entence was given to this effect:&mdash;That Anglade &s;hould be
<PB N="192" REF="036316_0192_1008DA099B0C4930">
condemned to &s;erve in the gallies for nine years; that his wife &s;hould, for the like term, be bani&s;hed from Paris, and its juri&s;diction; that they &s;hould pay three thou&s;and livres, re|paration to the count d'Montgomery as da|mages, and make re&s;titution of twenty-five thou|&s;and &s;ix hundred and &s;eventy-three livres, and either return the pearl necklace or pay four thou&s;and livres more. From this &s;um the five thou&s;and &s;even hundred and eighty livres, found in the &s;acks in the &s;ervants' room, were to be deducted, together with the &s;eventy louis d'ors found in the box, of which the of|ficer of ju&s;tice had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and al&s;o a double Spani&s;h pi&s;tole, and &s;eventeen louis d'ors, found on the per&s;on of Anglade, which was his own money.</P>
<P>Severe as this &s;entence was, and founded on &s;uch &s;light pre&s;umption, it was put imme|diately into execution. Anglade who&s;e con|&s;titution was already &s;inking under the heavy pre&s;&s;ure of his misfortunes, who&s;e l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mbs were contracted by the dampne&s;s of his pri&s;on, and who had undergone the mo&s;t excruciating tor|tures, was &s;ent to the tower of Montgomery, there to remain, without a&s;&s;i&s;tance or con&s;ola|tion, till the convicts condemned to the gallies were ready to go. He was then chained with them; a &s;ituation how dreadful! for a gentle|man, who&s;e &s;en&s;ibility of mind was extreme, and who had never &s;uffered the lea&s;t hard&s;hip or difficulty till then; when her was plunged

Yet, dreadful as the&s;e evils were, he &s;upported them with that patient firmne&s;s which nothing but con|&s;cious innocence could have produced. Re|duced to the extreme of human wretchedne&s;s, he felt not for him&s;elf; but when he reflected on the &s;ituation of his wife, and his infant daughter, his fortitude for&s;ook him. A fever had, from his fir&s;t confinement, preyed on his frame; its progre&s;s grew more rapid, and he felt his death inevitable; when the galley-&s;laves were collected to depart, he be&s;ought leave to &s;ee his wife, and to give his la&s;t ble&s;&s;ing to his child&mdash;but it was denied him!&mdash;He &s;ubmitted, and prepared to go; but being too weak to &s;tand, he was put into a waggon, whence he was lifted of a night, when they &s;topped, and laid on &s;traw, in a barn or out-hou&s;e, and the next morning car|ried again between two men to the waggon to continue his journey. In this manner, and believing every hour would be his la&s;t, the unhappy man arrived at Mar&s;eiles. It was a&s;&s;erted, but for the honour of human nature &s;hould not be believed, that the count de Montgomery pre&s;&s;ed his departure, notwith|&s;tanding the deplorable condition he was in,
<PB N="194" REF="036316_0194_1008DA0F5F76D328">
and even waited on the road to &s;ee him pa&s;s, and enjoy the horrid &s;pectacle of his &s;ufferings. The unhappy wife of this injured man had not been treated with more humanity. She had been dragged to pri&s;on, &s;eparate from that of her hu&s;band, and confined in a dungeon. She was with child, and the terror &s;he had undergone occa&s;ioned her to mi&s;carry.

<HEAD>THE PRETENDED MARTIN GUERRE.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING is more a&s;toni&s;hing than the infinite variety of the human face, in which there is &s;uch a prodigious difference of complexion and features; and where a differ|ence of expre&s;&s;ion is almo&s;t always ob&s;erved, even in tho&s;e who&s;e features and complexion are very much alike. Lopez de Vega &s;ome|where &s;ays, that nature, &s;ometimes weary of varying her works, copies her&s;elf and pro|duces two per&s;ons perfectly re&s;embling each other. Such mu&s;t have been the &s;imilitude between the two men who are the &s;ubjects of the following detail. Hi&s;tory mentions &s;e|veral celebrated impo&s;tors, who, taking ad|vantage of a likene&s;s to &s;ome other per&s;on, have u&s;urped their &s;tations or their fortunes: but there is perhaps no in&s;tance of an im|po&s;ture &s;o long and &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully carried on, as that which is here related.</P>
<P>Martin Guerre was born in Bi&s;caye, of parents who were &s;omewhat above the rank of pea&s;ants, and who appear to have
<PB N="203" REF="036316_0203_1008DA5E753EEF88">
&s;upported them&s;elves by the cultivation of their own land. It is probable, that in that part of Europe very early marriages are u&s;ual among all ranks of people; &s;ince this man, then only eleven years old, was (in 1539) married to Bertrande de Rols, nearly of the &s;ame age as him&s;elf. For nine or ten years they were without children; at length about the end of that period, they had a &s;on born, who was called Sun&s;ei; and &s;oon after, Mar|tin Guerre having given &s;ome offence to his father, ab&s;ented him&s;elf from home to avoid his di&s;plea&s;ure. And whether he found un|expected plea&s;ure in the variety afforded by the wandering life he embraced, or whether he had conceived any di&s;gu&s;t at &s;ome part of his wife's conduct, or was &s;atiated with her &s;ociety; from whatever cau&s;e it was, he continued the travel from place to place, and for &s;ome years his family knew not what was become of him.</P>
<P>Though is has often happened that a wife (e&s;pecially if young and hand&s;ome, as was Bertrande de Rols at that time) has thought that &s;uch neglect and de&s;ertion on the part of her hu&s;band, has ju&s;tified her forming other attachments; it does not appear that any charge of that nature was made again&s;t Bertrande de Rols: nor, for &s;ome years after her hu&s;band left her, did the &s;malle&s;t &s;u&s;picion of infidelity, or even indi&s;cretion, ari&s;e again&s;t her. At length a man appeared per&s;onating
<PB N="204" REF="036316_0204_1008DA189186B990">
her ab&s;ent hu&s;band, and in face, and figure &s;o nearly re&s;embling him, that the four &s;i&s;ters of Martin Guerre immediately acknowledged him to be their brother; Pierre Guerre, the uncle of Martin, as his nephew; and, in ge|neral, the relations on both &s;ides believed that it was him&s;elf. Be&s;ides the very &s;trong re|&s;emblance, he made him&s;elf known to Ber|trande de Rols by the relation of particulars known only to her and Martin Guerre her hu&s;band; and even enquired for certain ar|ticles of clothes, which he &s;aid he had on his departure depo&s;ited in places where they were found: circum&s;tances thaf probably di&s;&s;ipated any doubt which might have ari&s;en in the mind of Bertrande de Rols. Be that however as it might, &s;he received him as her hu&s;bands, and as &s;uch he continued to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ve <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">id her near three years, during which time &s;he had two children by him, one of which died &s;oon after its birth. He al&s;o in this period &s;old, as Martim Guerre, &s;everal parcels of land belong|ing to him. No mention being made of the parents of Martin Guerre, after he le&s;s his home, it is probable they died while he was ab&s;ent. Though the impo&s;tor had thoroughly &s;tudied his part it &s;eems almo&s;t incredible that Bertrande de Rols &s;hould have been deceived.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who thought ill of her, affirmed, that &s;he was too much attached to the impo&s;tor to wi&s;h the deception detected; and that &s;he willingly &s;hut her eyes again&s;t conviction.
<PB N="205" REF="036316_0205_1008DA615EBD7220">
But as &s;he &s;eems to have been of a timid tem|per, and perhaps of a weak under&s;tanding it is, not impo&s;&s;ible that &s;he might at fir&s;t have been impo&s;ed upon by the &s;trong re&s;emblance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he impo&s;tor bore to her hu&s;band, and by the knowledge he had of the mo&s;t &s;ecret tran&s;ac|tions of the life of Martin Guerre, and that afterwards, when doubts aro&s;e in her mind, &s;he might fear to enquire into the truth, till forced to do &s;o by the relations of her real hu&s;band. The&s;e relations, particularly his uncle Pierre Guerre, pretended, after above two years, to di&s;cover, that the man who had been re|ceived by them as Martin Guerre, was an impo&s;tor, and they in&s;i&s;ted on Bertrande de Rols joining in a pro&s;ecution of him with whom &s;he now lived as her hu&s;band. That timidity of &s;pirit, which had probably pre|vented her own &s;u&s;picions of his identity from appearing, made her now give way, with equal facility, to the impetuous re&s;entment of the family. She therefore agreed to appoint Pierre Guerre to act in her behalf, and to lay before the &s;eat of ju&s;tice her complaint again&s;t the man who had u&s;urped the name, rights, and effects of Martin Guerre, her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>This man, brought before the judges of Rieux, lamented the unequalled hard&s;hip of his de&s;tiny. He &s;aid, that the &s;uit com|menced again&s;t him, by which it was intended to rob him of his property and his life, was

He gave an account of the cities through which he had pa&s;&s;ed, in France and Spain, and the per&s;ons with whom he had re&s;ided and conver&s;ed in both kingdoms.

<P>Bertrande de Rols was next examined. Her an&s;wers agreed perfectly with tho&s;e of her &s;uppo&s;ed hu&s;band, in all the circum&s;tances wherein they were mutually concerned; and of an hundred and fifty witnene&s;&s;es, who were afterwards que&s;tioned, near &s;orty &s;wore, that the man now impri&s;oned on &s;uppo&s;ition of having u&s;urped the name and &s;tation of Martin Guerre, was actually Martin Guerre him&s;elf, and that they knew him to be the &s;ame with whom they had been acquainted from their infancy, not only by the general &s;imilitude of his per&s;on now, to what it was th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, but al&s;o by certain &s;cars and marks which he had ac|quired when a child, and which time had not effaced.</P>
<P>Other witne&s;&s;es being called, on behalf of the pro&s;ecutors, &s;wore as po&s;itively, that the man whom they now &s;aw, and who had &s;o long pa&s;&s;ed for Martin Guerre, was one Ar|naud du Tilk, commonly called Pan&s;ette, na|tive
<PB N="209" REF="036316_0209_1008DA68C947F618">
of Sagias, whom they had known from his cradle.</P>
<P>Sixty other witne&s;&s;es, on being &s;hewn the pri&s;oner, declared that they dated not decide, whether he was Martin Guerre or no, &s;o very &s;trong was the re&s;emblance.</P>
<P>The accu&s;ed obtained an order from the court, that Bertrande de Rols &s;hould be kept a part from Pierre Guerre and his a&s;&s;ociates. But at the &s;ame time the judges named a commi&s;&s;ion to go to Artiques, the place of Martin Guerre's re&s;idence, and to Sagias, the place from whence Arnaud du Tilk was &s;aid to come; that all particulars might be col|lected relative to them both, which might throw light on &s;o my&s;terious an affair.</P>
<P>They directed al&s;o, that the accu&s;ed &s;hould be compared with Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">xi Guerre, the &s;on; and with the four &s;i&s;ters of Martin Guerre. The re&s;ult was, that Sanxi did not at all re|&s;emble him; but the likene&s;s between him and the four women was &s;triking and ind&s;pu|table. This appeared a &s;trong circum&s;tance in his favour;&mdash;a child as often re&s;embles his mother as his father; and at that early period of life, the features are &s;ometimes &s;o little formed, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o give no decided likene&s;s to any part of a family: whereas the re&s;em|blance between the pri&s;oner and the four &s;i&s;ters of Martin Guerre, who were women nearly of the &s;ame age, and &s;uppo&s;ed to be
<PB N="210" REF="036316_0210_1008DA201CD4EBA0">
born of the &s;ame parents, &s;eemed a convincing proof of his identity.</P>
<P>But after examining many other witne&s;&s;es, and inve&s;tigating numberle&s;s proofs, the judges decided, that the pri&s;oner was not Martin Guerre, but Arnaud du Tilk of Sagias; and he was accordingly condemned.</P>
<P>He appealed again&s;t this &s;entence to the par|liament of Toulou&s;e; and that court thought it nece&s;&s;ary more fully to inve&s;tigate an affair &s;o full of difficulty and ob&s;curity. The party calling him&s;elf Martin Guerre was &s;ummoned to appear, with Bertrande de Rols, and his other accu&s;ers. The man maintained &s;o &s;teady a countenance, and an&s;wered in a manner &s;o unembarra&s;&s;ed and ingenuous, that the judges began to believe he was the real Martin Guerre; and the more &s;o, as they &s;aw in the deportment of Pierre Guerre the uncle, and Bertrande de Rols, a confu&s;ion and he&s;itation, which they imputed to the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their guilt.</P>
<P>Directions were given for a new com|mi&s;&s;ion, to renew all the enquiries, and to hear the witne&s;&s;es again.</P>
<P>But this renewed inve&s;tigation, in&s;tead of unveiling the my&s;tery, &s;erved only to wrap it in ten-fold ob&s;curity. Of thirty witne&s;&s;es who were now heard for the &s;econd time, nine or ten declared that the pri&s;oner was Martin Guerre, whom they had long known; eight as po&s;itively declared he was Arnaud

du Tilk; and the re&s;t, after having long de|liberated, prote&s;ted, that they could not charge their con&s;ciences with an oath, in a matter wherein, from the extreme re&s;em|blance between Martin Guerre and Arnaud du Tilk, they were unable to pronounce po|&s;itively to their &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>On collecting the whole evidence brought by the accu&s;ers, again&s;t the pri&s;oner, it ap|peared, that, in the whole, the depo&s;ition of forty-five witne&s;&s;es went to prove that he was Arnaud du Tilk, and among them &s;ome had de&s;ervedly great weight. The fir&s;t was Car|bon Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">reau, uncle by the mother's &s;ide to Arnaud du Tilk, who acknowledged him to be his nephew, and &s;eeing him a pri&s;oner, wept bitterly, and deplored the unhappy de&s;|tiny of a per&s;on &s;o nearly allied to him.&mdash;The &s;hoemaker who made &s;hoes for Martin Guerre, &s;wore that the mea&s;ure of his foot was of twelve inches, and that of the pri&s;oner was only nine.

It was al&s;o remarked, that Martin Guerre, being a native of Bi&s;caye, &s;poke the Ba&s;que, which differs very materially from the French and Ga&s;co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> languages; whereas the pri&s;oner knew only a few words of it, which he often unncee&s;|&s;arily introduced into his di&s;cour&s;e to conceal

his general ignorance of what he would be thought to under&s;tand.&mdash;Several witne&s;&s;es de|po&s;ed, that Arnaud du Tilk, had, from his earlie&s;t years, been abandoned to every kind of vice; that he was an athei&s;t, a bla&s;phemer, and guilty of fraud and theft; whence it fol|lowed, that he was capable of committing the crime he was now charged with.</P>
<P>The &s;trength, however, of this body of evi|dence &s;eemed very much dimini&s;hed by what followed, in favour of his being the per&s;on who&s;e name he a&s;&s;umed.</P>
<P>Upwards of thirty per&s;ons, who had known Martin Guerre from his infancy, declared that the pri&s;oner was the man. Among the&s;e witne&s;&s;es, tho&s;e who&s;e depo&s;itions &s;eemed the mo&s;t convincing, were the four &s;i&s;ters of Mar|tin Guerre; and the hu&s;bands of the two who were married corroborated their evidence. Other per&s;ons, who had been pre&s;ent at the marriage ceremony between Martin Guerre and Bertrande de Rols, depo&s;ed, that this was the &s;ame per&s;on who was then married. As proofs of his identity, they &s;wore to &s;everal marks about his per&s;on, which on examination, were all found on the per&s;on of the pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>It &s;eemed to be generally acknowledged, that when the pri&s;oner arrived at Artiques, he &s;poke to every one he met, who knew Mar|tin Guerre, calling them by their names. That &s;ome of the&s;e, not immediately recol|lecting him, he told them he was their old ac|quaintance,
<PB N="214" REF="036316_0214_1008DA2740902A40">
Martin Guerre, and reminded them of conver&s;ations and events that had formerly happened, and of places where they had been, and parties made in his company, twelve, fourteen, or twenry years back. And to Bertrande de Rols he mentioned &s;everal circum&s;tances, which could be known only to her and Martin Guerre her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Other depo&s;itions went to prove, that Pierre Guerre, the uncle, had declared hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> re&s;olution to ruin the pri&s;oner at all events; and had endeavoured to make his whole fa|mily enter into a combination to gratify his revenge. To procure money to carry on the &s;uit, he had applied to one Jean Loze of Pal|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">os, who had refu&s;ed to advance it, &s;aying, he would not contribute to the ruin of his relation. They added, that it was generally believed at Artiques, that Bertrande de Rols was terrified into joining in this pro&s;ecution, by the threats of Pierre Guerre, and of her mother, who was now the wife of Pierre Guerre; and that &s;he did not willingly carry it on; believing that the pri&s;oner was really her hu&s;band. The depo&s;itions of the four &s;i&s;ters of Martin Guerre, and their great re&s;emblance to the pri&s;oner, was a &s;trong circum&s;tance in his favour. Tho&s;e who &s;aw them together affirmed, that a more &s;triking likene&s;s was impo&s;&s;ible; they had the &s;ame features, complexion, and ca&s;t of countenance.</P>
<P>When, in the cour&s;e of the examinations,
<PB N="215" REF="036316_0215_1008DA7015B7FB78">
the pri&s;oner was confronted with Bertrande de Rols, he conjured her, by all that was &s;acred, to a knowledge the truth; he told her that his fate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">epended upon her, and that he was content it &s;hould do &s;o; &s;ince if &s;he with a &s;afe con&s;cienc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> could &s;wear, that he was not Martin Guerre her hu&s;band, he would con&s;ent to undergo the mo&s;t cruel puni&s;hment. To this &s;he an&s;wered, that &s;he neither would &s;wear or believe that he was not Martin Guerre. It was acknowledged, that before &s;he was in|cluced, by the threats of Pierre Guerre, and her mother, to in&s;titute a &s;uit again&s;t the pri|&s;oner, &s;he had lived with him above three years without ever appearing to doubt of his being really Martin Guerre, her hu&s;band; and, when doubts aro&s;e with others, &s;he ex|pre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf with great a&s;perity again&s;t tho&s;e who mentioned tho&s;e doubts before her, &s;ay|ing, that &s;urely &s;he mu&s;t know her hu&s;band, better than any one el&s;e could; that &s;he would puni&s;h tho&s;e who dared to propagate &s;o &s;can|dalous a fal&s;ehood.</P>
<P>It al&s;o appeared, that &s;he had often com|plained of the tyranny of Pierre Guerre and her mother, who had, &s;he &s;aid, forced her, again&s;t her inclinations, to enter into the pro|ce&s;s again&s;t the pri&s;oner, and had threatened, if &s;he did not, to turn her out of the hou&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> lived in, and otherwi&s;e to pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ecute <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.

accu&s;ed the pri&s;oner of a crime, for which he had been impri&s;oned; and, while he was &s;o, that Pierre Guerre and his wife (the mother of Bertrande de Rols) ince&s;&s;antly be&s;ieged her to con&s;ent to pro&s;ecute him for pretending to be Martin Guerre, which &s;he then refu&s;ed; and when, after &s;ome time, he was relea&s;ed from pri&s;on, on the charge, which Jean d'Ef|cornebeuf had brought again&s;t him, being found fal&s;e, Bertrande de Rols received him with every demon&s;tration of affection; not|with&s;tanding which, immediately afterwards, Pierre Guerre obliged her to become a party in the &s;uit again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Thus &s;tood the evidence on both &s;ides of this remarkable que&s;tion, and it &s;eems that the judges were on the point of deciding in favour of the pri&s;oner; when the real Martin Guerre &s;uddenly appeared. He came from Spain, and had a wooden leg, as the &s;oldier had a&s;&s;erted. Immediately on his arrival, he pre&s;ented a memorial to the court, de&s;iring leave to plead his cau&s;e, and to bring proofs of his identity.</P>
<P>An order was accordingly made for his ex|amination, and that he &s;hould be confronted with Bertrande de Rols, and with the four &s;i&s;ters, who&s;e evidence had been the &s;tronge&s;t in favour of the pri&s;oner. He was then ex|amined, in the &s;ame manner as the pri&s;oner had been before, and on the &s;ame particulars; and his an&s;wers were not found &s;o clear and exact as tho&s;e of his repre&s;entative.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="036316_0217_1008DA7432CE3DA8">
They were then confronted. The man accu&s;ed of being an impo&s;tor treated Martin Guerre as a rogue and a cheat, dre&s;&s;ed up by the artifices of Pierre Guerre, the uncle; and declared that he would content to be hanged, if he did not prove, to the &s;atisfac|tion of the court, that the man, who now pretended to be Martin Guerre, was a more machine, taught to act his part by his enemies. He then que&s;tioned his adver&s;ary on &s;everal circum&s;tances, which, if he was Martin Guerre, he ought to have known. His an|&s;wers were confu&s;ed and un&s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>The commi&s;&s;ioners then taking the la&s;t man apart interrogated him on &s;everal new points, to which neither of them had before an&s;wered; his an&s;wers were found to corre&s;pond with the truth. Then taking apart the fir&s;t pre|tender, they put the &s;ame que&s;tions to him; and, to ten or twelve of tho&s;e que&s;tions, he an&s;wered as exactly as his opponent.</P>
<P>The four &s;i&s;ters, and the hu&s;bands of the two who were married, were then ordered to ap|pear, together with Pierre Guerre, the bro|thers of Arnaud du Tilk, and as many as could be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound of the former witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>They appeared accordingly, except the brothers of Arnaud du Tilk, who e&s;caped, that they might not be obliged to give their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> again&s;t him.</P>

&s;hewn he two per&s;ons, who both a&s;&s;erted that they were her brother.

<P>The hu&s;bands of the married &s;i&s;ters did the &s;ame; and tho&s;e witne&s;&s;es, who had &s;worn mo&s;t po&s;itively that the fir&s;t of the&s;e men was Martin Guerre, now, on &s;eeing him with the real Martin Guerre, owned they had been in an error.</P>
<P>Bertrande de Rols, the wife, was then or|dered to approach; who no &s;ooner beheld her hu&s;band, than, wild with confu&s;ion and ter|ror, trembling, and in tears, &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">an to him, embraced him, and implored his pardon for the fault &s;he had committed, in receiving as her hu&s;band an infamous impo&s;tor.

<P>Her beauty (for &s;he is de&s;cribed as being very hand&s;ome) and her tears affected every body, except her hu&s;band; who, though he appeared &s;o moved with the tenderne&s;s and affection of his &s;i&s;ters, was in&s;en&s;ible of the penitence and humility of his wife, whom he repul&s;ed with rage and indignation, pu&s;hed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> rudely from him, and bid her not play the hypocrite.

<P>The impo&s;ture being now clearly proved, &s;entence was given again&s;t Arnaud du Tilk; that he &s;hould be hanged, and his body re|duced to a&s;hes.

<P>The court deliberated, whether Martin Guerre and Bertrande de Rols were not liable to &s;ome puni&s;hment; the latter for adultery, and the former, for having, by his de&s;ertion and neglect of his wife, occa&s;ioned it, and for having &s;erved in the Spani&s;h army. But, as the crime committed by the woman was through ignorance, and as the man did not de&s;ignedly betray her into it, they were not deemed objects of public ju&s;tice.

<P>THE &s;ieur d'Antail had by his fir&s;t wife two daughters, Loui&s;a, and Henrietta. As he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an affluent fortune, and fond of his children, he &s;pared no expen&s;e in their education.

She did not expre&s;s any partiality to de Val|morin; but &s;he was not without coquetry, and could not re&s;i&s;t the plea&s;ure of hearing her&s;elf flattered by &s;everal admirers at the &s;ame time; yet Pradelle &s;eemed to have the preference.

To this remon&s;trance du Fre&s;ne replied, "It is better that &s;he &s;hould hazard perdition in a convent, than, by remaining in the world, become the cau&s;e of the perdition of many others, whom her beauty would involve in the

It was evident that the unfortunate Loui&s;a was to be the victim of her &s;tep-mother's apprehen&s;ions, and of her hatred, occa&s;ioned by tho&s;e extraordinary perfections of form, which are too apt to excite envy and ill-humour in women, even after they have cea&s;ed to value them&s;elves on outward advan|tages. Not content with the &s;ucce&s;s of her project hitherto, madame d'Antail did not even &s;eek to &s;often the horrors of perpetual confinement, by allowing her daughter-in-law the alleviations of affluence: they would give her no more than &s;ix hundred livres on her entrance; the nuns refu&s;ed to receive her un|le&s;s &s;he had more. On this occa&s;ion the un|fortunate victim wrote thus to madame du Fre&s;ne, who was again employed between her and her parents: "I know, madam, that &s;ix hundred livres are enough for tho&s;e who can execute the duties of the life into which they enter; but as it is impo&s;&s;ible for me ever to do &s;o, and as the community are already &s;en|&s;ible that I never can perform what is expected of the generality, and mu&s;t have many exemp|tions, they refu&s;e to receive me, unle&s;s I bring a greater &s;um: I be&s;eech you therefore, madam, intercede with my father to have &s;ome con&s;i|deration for his child; and to pay for me what is required."

But whatever outward re&s;olution &s;he had &s;hewn, and whatever pains were taken by the mother-in-law and her party to make this &s;tep appear voluntary, Loui&s;a had found means to declare her aver&s;ion in a legal form.

her &s;ituation; &s;he could not command her&s;elf enough to feel any relief in the &s;ociety of the nuns; and the duties of religion &s;he was un|able to perform: the only con&s;olation &s;he found, was in the company of the &s;ieur Cou&s;|turier, a coun&s;ellor, who, vi&s;iting a relation in the convent, had &s;een Loui&s;a, and, &s;truck with the wonderful beauty which the reli|gious habit could not conceal, had cultivated an acquaintance with her. He frequently vi&s;ited her at the grate, where &s;he told him the cruel per&s;ecutions &s;he had undergone from the hatred of her &s;tep-mother; the reluctance with which &s;he continued in the mona&s;tery, and the precaution &s;he had taken to prote&s;t again&s;t the vows &s;he had been con&s;trained to make.

Before &s;he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her new e&s;tabli&s;hment, &s;he had the precaution to renew the prote&s;t again&s;t her original vows, by an act, wherein &s;he declared that &s;he not only con&s;idered them as extorted and nugatory but that &s;he did not mean to confirm them by her pre&s;ent removal, or by any &s;ub&s;equent act, and that &s;he always re&s;erved a right to avail her&s;elf of her fir&s;t prote&s;t whenever &s;he &s;hould &s;ee occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The new community at Lagny were de&s;ir|ous of being con&s;idered as &s;ubject only to the authority of the cordeliers, who are the &s;upe|rior branch of the claires; and to be wholly exempt from the juri&s;diction of the archbi|&s;hop of Paris: the prelate defended his right, and a law-&s;uit was likely to be the con&s;equence.

To compleat his unea|&s;ine&s;s, he learned that Loui&s;a was to be re|moved to Lagny; where, being no longer under the direction of the abbe&s;s, nor re&s;|trained by the ob&s;ervations of the numerous members of the community, &s;he would no longer be obliged to give an account of her actions; but might entertain Cou&s;turier as long and as often as &s;he plea&s;ed, in the parlour of the ho&s;pital, having no other interruption than the duties of her office.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this degree of liberty, Loui&s;a knew that great care was nece&s;&s;ary, to prevent the imputation of an improper con|nection between her and Cou&s;turier; on the lea&s;t &s;urmi&s;e of which, &s;he fore&s;aw that &s;he &s;hould no longer be &s;uffered to &s;ee him at all, but &s;hould be forced back to the mona&s;tery, and &s;o clo&s;ely confined, that &s;he &s;hould have no chance of ever &s;eeing tho&s;e who

In con&s;equence of which, the banns of marriage between Fran|cis Cou&s;turier and Loui&s;a d'Antail were im|mediately publi&s;hed in the church of St Op|portune, her pari&s;h, and a contract of mar|curate of St. Opportune, as he had the con|&s;ent of the father, declared that he &s;hould proceed notwith&s;tanding, and gave his permi&s;|riage was drawn up, wherein the &s;ieur d'An|tail gave her the &s;hare of his fortune and ef|fects, to which &s;he was entitled.

Le Vacher, di&s;appointed in this hope, had now recour&s;e to the grand vicar; who took not the lea&s;t notice of his application. He appealed al&s;o to the court <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> archbi|&s;hop; but, as the oppo&s;ition of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> hu&s;|band did not &s;eem to have weight enough to counteract the con&s;ent and wi&s;hes of the fa|ther, the marriage was celebrated in due form; and, within twelve months afterwards, Loui&s;a became mother of a &s;on. But &s;he had the mortification to find that the pro&s;ecutions of Le Vacher were not at an end. He re|commenced a &s;uit, in which he endeavoured to make it appear that the di&s;&s;olution of Lou|i&s;a's vows had been illegally obtained; and this he hoped to prove, &s;ince there is a law, which &s;ays, that mona&s;tic vows, if made above five years, cannot in any ca&s;e, or on any pretence what&s;oever, be annulled; and it was near &s;even years from the time of Lou|i&s;a's taking the veil, before &s;he applied to the court of Rome. On this ground the cau&s;e was brought before the parliament of Paris. Where, notwith&s;tanding the eloquence of mon&s;ieur Gualtier, an eminent pleader, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">everal ca&s;es in point being produced, the par|liament, apprehen&s;ive that if &s;ome tmie were not certainly fixed, after which religious vows <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ould become irrevocable, the fortunes of families could never be a&s;certained; and that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> would occa&s;ion perpetual attempts of nuns

Her marriage was declared illegal, and her child illegiti|mate, and &s;he was ordered to return imme|diately to her convent. The di&s;tre&s;s and an|gui&s;h occa&s;ioned by this inhuman decree can be better imagined than de&s;cribed. Deter|mined, however, to make one &s;truggle, be|fore &s;he was torn away from connections &s;o dear to her, and buried forever in a &s;itua|tion infinitely wor&s;e than death, Loui&s;a and her hu&s;band appealed from this &s;entence to the privy council. The council referred an in|ve&s;tigation of the whole to the parliament of Metz; where, after a long conte&s;t, the final de|ci&s;ion was &s;uch, as every friend to the rights of humanity mu&s;t hear with plea&s;ure. The vows taken by Loui&s;a were declared null; her marriege was confirmed, and her children re&s;tored to their rights. Thus, after part of her life had been pa&s;&s;ed under the mo&s;t unju&s;t and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing per&s;ecution, &s;he was at liberty to enjoy the re&s;t of it wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h an hu&s;band and children de&s;ervedly and fondly beloved.

He retired to Florence, and died in the Sienois in 1640, leaving &s;everal children by his wife Henrietta Catharine de Joyeu&s;e, only daughter of Henry de Joyeu&s;e, marechal of France, and widow of Henry de Bourbon, duke de Montpen&s;ier. His &s;on, Henry de Lorraine, born in 1514, became (by the death of his elde&s;t brother) duke of Gui&s;e. He &s;eemed to inherit the &s;pirit, as well as the per&s;onal perfections of his grandfather, the celebrated duke of Gui&s;e.

was afterwards married to the palatine of the Rhine. Cardinal de Richelieu, who fore&s;aw that a marriage between this lady and the duke of Gui&s;e would be prejudicial to the intere&s;ts of France, divided them, by putting her into a convent, from whence, however, &s;he e&s;caped, and when the duke of Gui&s;e joined the party of the count de So<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ons (which party, under pretence of delivering the kingdom from the admini&s;tration of the cardinal, covered more da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gerous projects) &s;he found means to follow him, in man's ap|parel and overtook him at Colo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">.

<P>The duke now entered with his u&s;ual im|petuo&s;ity into the con&s;piracy, which took, a very alarming form, and was &s;anctioned by the &s;pecious name of "The league formed to pre&s;erve the peace of Chri&s;tendom." As archbi&s;hop of Rheims he was the fir&s;t &s;piritual peer, and as duke of Gui&s;e, the mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> emporal peer of France; but the&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> he broke through, and was declared general of the armies of the league.</P>

The king pro&s;ecuted him for rebellion; and by an arret he was declared guilty of trea&s;on, &s;entenced to be beheaded, and his effects con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;cated; which &s;entence was executed on him in eff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gy a few days afterwards, and all his property &s;eized by the crown.</P>
<P>The duke went to Bru&s;&s;els, where he took upon him the command of the troops, which were &s;ent thither by the emperor and the king of Spain. There he found his aunt, the duche&s;s of Chevreu&s;e, who had been obliged to quit France for her intrigues again&s;t car|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters"> Richelieu; and at her hou&s;e he became acquainted with the counte&s;s de Bo&s;&s;u, a young and beautiful widow, who&s;e vivacity and per&s;onal attractions were more than &s;uf|ficient to inflame a heart &s;o &s;u&s;ceptible of the power of beauty as was that of the duke of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">i&s;e.</P>
<P>The anecdotes of that time give an account of their acquaintance and its con&s;equence; which is perhaps &s;omewhat heightened by the lively imagination of the writers, who, to bring truth nearer to romance, have embel|li&s;hed it with their own colouring.

<P>The duke of Gui&s;e having often &s;een the counte&s;s of Bo&s;&s;u at the hou&s;e of the duche&s;s of Chevreu&s;e, was equally charmed by her beauty, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> with her vivacity. The

lady, on her part, thought &s;uch a conque&s;t as that of the hand&s;ome&s;t and mo&s;t accompli&s;h|ed man in Europe, de&s;erved all her attention, and that &s;he might forgive her&s;elf even &s;ome unu&s;ual advances to &s;ecure it. The&s;e, how|ever, &s;he conducted with &s;o much art, that the duke grew every day more in love; and when madame de Bo&s;&s;u thought he was enough &s;o to refu&s;e her nothing, &s;he &s;poke to him of marriage; to which the duke an&s;wered that he de&s;ired nothing &s;o much as to unite his de&s;tiny with hers: but if madame de Bo&s;&s;u had known more of his real character, &s;he might have perceived, that he would not thus readily have entered into engagements, had he thought them binding; and that he only wi&s;hed to amu&s;e him&s;elf during his exile. She knew enough to doubt the performance of his promi&s;e; but, flattered by the hope of &s;eeing in her fetters him for whom &s;o many vainly &s;ighed, &s;he pretended to be the dupe of his ready profe&s;&s;ion, while &s;he in fact meditated how to make him hers. With this view, as it was now the fine&s;t part of the year, &s;he made a party to go to a beautiful &s;eat &s;he had, a league from Bru&s;&s;els, where &s;he contrived to amu&s;e the duke for &s;ome days, with every thing &s;he thought agreeable to him. The duke, flattered by her atten|tion, &s;poke to her more pa&s;&s;ionately than he had yet done; to which the counte&s;s an|&s;wered, that if he was &s;incere in his profe&s;|&s;ions,
<PB N="244" REF="036316_0244_1008DA51A64BE0F8">
if his love was as great as he pretended, he would ha&s;ten the completion of their marriage. The duke prote&s;ted there was nothing he &s;o ardently de&s;ired as to be united for ever with &s;o amiable a per&s;on. Madame de Bo&s;&s;u, who was in hopes &s;he &s;hould bring him to that declaration, then told him, he might immediately convince her of his ve|racity, and &s;ecure the happine&s;s he &s;eemed &s;o much to de&s;ire, for that &s;he had a prie&s;t and a notary ready, who would in&s;tantly perform the ceremonies. The duke, who certainly did not believe the marriage under &s;uch circum|&s;tances would be binding to him, con&s;ented with as much apparent &s;atisfaction as if he had been &s;incere. Man&s;elle, the almoner of the army, was called in, who gave them a di&s;pen&s;ation, for want of the proper banns, and then the nuptial benediction. The next day the duke re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urned to Bru&s;&s;els, leaving the counte&s;s de Bo&s;&s;u extremely happy, at being, as &s;he imagined, duche&s;s of Gui&s;e, and wife to the mo&s;t charming man of the age.</P>
<P>Whatever care had been taken to keep this tran&s;action &s;ecret, it became in a few weeks the conver&s;ation of Bru&s;&s;els; the duke d'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">euf, and the duche&s;s de Chevreu&s;e, both &s;poke to the duke upon it in a &s;tile of &s;everity he was by no means di&s;po&s;ed to bear.

but his firey temper could ill brook the re|mon&s;trance of the duke d'Elbeuf, whom he an&s;wered in terms &s;o full of rage and indig|nation, that a challenge pa&s;&s;ed between them; and they were prevented fighting, only by the interpo&s;ition of the archduke.</P>
<P>Extremely irritated to think that any one &s;hould dare to pry into and blame his actions, he determined to &s;hew how little he con&s;idered their di&s;approbation, by bringing madame de Bo&s;&s;u home to his hou&s;e, and owning her as his wife; which at fir&s;t he meant not to do, and had even prevailed on her to conceal their marriage, by repre&s;enting to her that it would be nece&s;&s;ary for him to try to recon|cile his family to the match before he ac|knowledged it.

de Bo&s;&s;u, fearle&s;s of the danger &s;he incurred, determined at all events to &s;ee her hu&s;band, tru&s;ting that all his former tenderne&s;s would return when he beheld her: &s;he was particu|larly induced to hope this from a letter &s;he had received, in which he prote&s;ted to her, that he was incapable of infidelity; that his honour and his con&s;cience, as well as his in|clination, attached him to her; and he only lamented, that the contagion of his misfortunes had reached her, whom he loved more than life; but &s;he might a&s;&s;ure her&s;elf death only &s;hould &s;eparate them. Her courage was &s;trengthened by a letter &s;o flattering to her hopes: &s;he determined to di&s;gui&s;e her&s;elf, and &s;et out for France; and, traveling with equal expedition and &s;ecrecy, &s;he threw her&s;elf into his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rms, before, he knew &s;he was on her journey.

intrigue, and to the warmth of his ungovern|able temper, &s;oon after got into a quarrel with the count de Coligni: they fought in the mid&s;t of the court, and the duke of Gui&s;e dangerou&s;ly wounded and di&s;armed his antagoni&s;t.

But the duke had fallen in love with mademoi&s;elle de Pons; and as this new attachment was, if po&s;&s;ible, more violent than any he had yet felt, he po|&s;itively refu&s;ed to li&s;ten to any overtures in regard to mademoi&s;elle de Longueville. As he determined to marry mademoi&s;elle de Pons, it became nece&s;&s;ary for him to enquire how far his marriage with the counte&s;s de Bo&s;&s;u might prevent the completion of his wi&s;hes; and he found that it would rai&s;e &s;uch impedi|ments to his de&s;igns, as he &s;hould find it ex|tremely difficult to obviate; this con&s;ideration, and the trouble he received from the attor|ney-general (who pro&s;ecuted him for his of|fence again&s;t law and order, by fighting pub|licly with the count de Coligni), determined him to go him&s;elf to Rome; where he hoped

It i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> unnece&s;&s;ary here to relate the various events that occured while he continued in this com|mand. The charms of mademoi&s;elle de Pons, which had induced him to go to Rome, in hopes of being allowed to marry her, were now forgotten, amid the attractions of the Neapolitan beauties: but his general gallan|tries among the lowe&s;t of the people, and his attachment to the daughter of a tailor in par|ticular, di&s;gu&s;ted tho&s;e who at fir&s;t had beheld him with admiration and re&s;pect; and at length his u&s;ual ra&s;hne&s;s made him commit an indi&s;cretion, which put the town into the hands of the Spaniards. He had then re|cour&s;e to flight; but was pur&s;ued, taken, and &s;ent pri&s;oner to Spain.</P>
<P>While this was pa&s;&s;ing, the unfortunate counte&s;s of Bo&s;&s;u was &s;ued by the duke's cre|ditors;

and her effects, as well as the dower &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed from her fir&s;t hu&s;band, &s;eized to &s;atisfy their demands. Notwith&s;tanding which, and all his neglect and cruelty, &s;he no &s;ooner heard of his impri&s;onment, than &s;he quitted the hou&s;e of her mother, with whom &s;he was obliged to re&s;ide, and went into France, meaning to pa&s;s from thence into Spain, to &s;olicit his relea&s;e, or &s;hare his confinement. Her friends, however, repre&s;ented to her, that her journey would be ab&s;olutely fruitle&s;s; and prevailed upon her to return into Flanders. By the interpo&s;ition of the great Cond&eacute;, who then &s;erved the king of Spain again&s;t his na|tive country, the duke was &s;oon after relea&s;ed: the Spani&s;h court, indeed, gave him his liberty the more willingly, as they hoped that his turbulent and re&s;tle&s;s &s;piait would create new troubles in France. He was no &s;ooner at li|berty, than he di&s;claimed all obligations to the prince of Conde, and complained loudly of the treatment he received at Madrid. The ra&s;hne&s;s of his character &s;eemed to have gained &s;trength by his confinement; his politics and his love a&s;&s;umed a more violent ca&s;t; the pa&s;|&s;ion he had felt for mademoi&s;elle de Pons, &s;eemed to return with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ardour than ever; and he determined to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ake her his, at what|ever price. But when he learned, too cer|tainly, that during his ab&s;ence &s;he had re|ceived as a favourite lover mon&s;ieur de Ma|licorne, a private gentleman, rage and indig|nation

&s;tifled all the emotions of tenderne&s;s he had felt for her; he treated her with rude|ne&s;s and in&s;ult, and in&s;i&s;ted on her returning a pair of ear-rings, valued at a thou&s;and crowns, which he had given her: he even &s;ued her to oblige her to re&s;tore them; but had the mor|tification of lo&s;ing his &s;uit; which circum|&s;tance depriving him of all patience and tem|per, he threatened per&s;onal vengeance again&s;t the object of his former attachment; who, to avoid it, was driven to quit the kingdom.</P>
<P>Being then without any pur&s;uit, and his capricious and violent temper making it im|po&s;&s;ible for him to remain long quiet, he failed on another expedition to Naples, which did not an&s;wer his expectation; and, on his return, a new pa&s;&s;ion, more violent than any he had yet felt, attached him to mademoi&s;elle de Gorce.</P>
<P>In 1664 he died, leaving no po&s;terity. All his brothers died before him; as did his &s;i&s;ters afterwards, unmarried. Thus ended the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of Gui&s;e; the enterpriz|ing ambition of which had &s;o long di&s;turbed the tranquility of France.</P>
<P>Madame de Bo&s;&s;u, ruined by the vey means which &s;he hoped would have made her the happie&s;t woman in Europe, endeavoured to recover from the heirs of the duke of Gui&s;e, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> jointure as his wife.

<HEAD>THE CHEVALIER DE MORSAN.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is perhaps one of the mo&s;t romantic hi&s;tories that the various occurrences of human life ever produced. Though &s;everal fictions have been founded on events &s;imilar to what is here related, fiction it&s;elf has hardly been able to produce a more extraordi|nary collection of circum&s;tances, and per|haps the truth never having been perfectly known, adds to the intere&s;t of the &s;tory. A notary at Paris, who&s;e name was Charles Henry Donc, who was in a reputable &s;ituation, left, at his decea&s;e, his three children, a &s;on and two daughters, to the care of his wife, Mary Clement. He had not been long dead, when his relations found the conduct of this woman &s;o improper, and her profu&s;ion &s;o great, that they apprehended &s;he would di&s;|&s;ipate the money left as a provi&s;ion for the children; and that even the goods and effects in the hou&s;e would be &s;eized by her creditors, and the children be defrauded of every thing: &s;ince it is well known, in every country, that

Under the&s;e apprehen&s;ions for the minors, the kindred of Charles Henry Donc petitioned to have a guardian appointed, to whom the mother might be obliged to account. The &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur de Joigny was named their guardian; and, as madame Donc, could not her&s;elf make up the accounts nece&s;&s;ary to be produced on this occa&s;ion, &s;he employed a man named Robert, clerk to a notary, to adju&s;t her books: for which purpo&s;e he was obliged to be very frequently at the hou&s;e.

He &s;ent her to board at the convent of the &s;i&s;ters of St. Gervais, from whence &s;he refu&s;ed to return for &s;ome time to her mother; dreading le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t the importunity of her di&s;a|greeable lover, aided by the authority of a parent &s;he had always obeyed, might force her into a marriage &s;he dete&s;ted. Her fears on this head were but too well founded. Robert, finding &s;he did not as u&s;ual vi&s;it at home, determined to force her from her a&s;ylum in the convent; and her mother con&s;ented to the expedient. He took his mea&s;ures &s;o well, that &s;eizing her as &s;he came from ma&s;s with &s;ome other pen&s;ioners, he carried her no one knew whither. The guardian complained to the police, but without effect; and nine or ten days afterwards Robert married her, in pre&s;ence of her mother, and four other wit|ne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>As there was now no remedy, the relations of the unfortunate girl thought it mo&s;t pru|dent to drop the &s;uit they had commenced again&s;t Robert, and &s;he was obliged to &s;ubmit to her de&s;tiny.

relations. Her father's kindred con&s;ulted together on the means of re&s;cuing the unhappy young creature from the hands of a wretch &s;o unworthy of her; and they determined, that her guardian &s;hould appeal again&s;t the validity of a marriage, which was a mere abu&s;e of the ceremony, and a violation both of law and religion. This mea&s;ure was im|mediately put into execution; and a &s;entence was obtained, which directed, that Charlotte Donc &s;hould retire to the convent of La Ro|quette, till the cau&s;e could be heard and de|cided. Thither therefore &s;he went; but found even there no re&s;pite from the per&s;ecu|tion of Robert; who ince&s;&s;antly be&s;ieged the door of the convent, and even endeavoured to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> her from thence by force; which twice obliged the nuns to lay complaints again&s;t him. But as the&s;e attempts failed, he had recour&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> other means; and commenced a &s;uit aga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;t the &s;ieur Mars de Joigny, for detaining and &s;ecreting his wife.

After &s;ome days of fruitle&s;s &s;earch, he &s;ummoned the &s;ieur Mars de Joigny to produce his wife, or to inform him where &s;he was. The &s;ieur Joigny, in his defence, declared, that he knew not the place of her retreat; and alleged, that as no &s;entence had put her into his care, he was not an&s;wer|able for her appearance. With this an&s;wer Robert was obliged to withdraw his com|plaint; and to apply all his indu&s;try to di&s;|cover his fugitive wife. But every effort he made was fruitle&s;s: he could neither find her, or hear whether &s;he was yet among &s;he living. After &s;ome years, in which he ince&s;&s;antly &s;ought her, had elap&s;ed, the pa&s;&s;ion fal&s;ely called love, and the thir&s;t of vengeance, both of which had probably concurred in produc|ing his ardent de&s;ire to find her, began to

abate, and his enquiries were relaxed; and at length, after fifteen years, he co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cluded &s;he was dead, and thought only of marrying again. Being, however, de&s;irous of a&s;cer|taining his &s;ituation, he again laid his com|plaint before the police, on the e&s;cape of his wife. But this la&s;t effort was as fruitle&s;s as the former; and now, being almo&s;t certain that, if &s;he was not dead, &s;he would never appear to claim him as her hu&s;band, he de|termined to remove to another quarter of the town, di&s;engage him&s;elf from the acquaint|ance of all who remembered his marriage with Charlotte, and pa&s;s for a bachelor. In this character, after he had quitted all his former connections, he introduced him&s;elf to Magda|len Pon&s;ignard, the widow of the &s;ieur Ma&s;&s;on d'Anglu&s;e, a lawyer, who con&s;ented to marry him. She was near &s;ixty years old; but &s;he had money, which attracted Robert; though &s;he had the precaution to have the marriage contract &s;o drawn up, that each party were to remain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of their &s;eparate property. This &s;econd alliance formed by Robert, was not happier than the fir&s;t. Madame d An|glu&s;e complained, very &s;oon afterwards, that the mo&s;t affronting outrages were exerci&s;ed upon her: that he perpetually reproached her with her age; and, not contented with ill-language only, that he even proceeded to the mo&s;t cruel per&s;onal in&s;ults: and as &s;he was not of atemper to &s;uffer &s;uch treatment pa|tiently,
<PB N="260" REF="036316_0260_1008DAFA23D04A08">
they &s;oon came to extremities, and agreed only in one thing, which was to part, and that each &s;hould remain in unmole&s;ted po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their own eftects. In pur&s;uance of this convention, the wife retired to a con|vent; where &s;he had not been long re&s;ident, before Robert, who &s;eems to have been po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of one of tho&s;e unhappy tempers which want &s;omebody to torment, pur&s;ued her, and in&s;i&s;ted on her returning to live with him. But &s;he had found the life &s;he had led with him &s;o entirely in&s;upportable, that neither threats nor intreaties could prevail upon her to encounter it again. She peremptorily and &s;teadily refu&s;ed; and having, in the cour&s;e of the conte&s;t, learned more of her hu&s;band's former life, than had till then come to her knowledge, and di&s;covered his marriage with Charlotte Donc; &s;he re&s;olved to try, whether &s;he could not annul her own unhappy connec|tion, by pleading, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Robert's former wife was never proved to be dead, he had been guilty of bigamy in marrying again.

The information collected by the coun&s;el whom his &s;econd wife employed, completely proved the mar|riage of Robert with Margaret Charlotte Donc. He was &s;ummoned to appear and to be examined. He had nothing to offer, but

his pro&s;ecution of the per&s;ons who were &s;uppo&s;ed to have concealed his fir&s;t wife; which he now renewed, in hopes of certify|ing her death; and, to &s;hew that he had him|&s;elf no doubt of it, he produced the deed, by which he had re&s;tored to her brother all the money he had received as the portion of Charlotte Donc.

that &s;he died of the &s;mall-pox: to &s;ub&s;tantiate an a&s;&s;ertion &s;o extraordinary, he related the follow|ing particulars. He &s;aid, that when his wife, after hearing the deci&s;ion again&s;t her, had e&s;|caped from him through the crowd that at|tended in the hall of the court of ju&s;tice, &s;he found refuge in the hou&s;e of the &s;ieur d'Imon|ville; where, as &s;oon as &s;he arrived, madame Royer had dre&s;&s;ed her in the habit of an offi|cer, with a &s;carlet coat, a laced hat, a &s;word, and other accoutrements; and &s;he a&s;&s;umed the title of the chevalier du Coudray; but the habit &s;he had taken could not cure or conceal the terrors of a woman, who, in perpetual fear of being known, and carried back to her hu&s;band, was for &s;ome months never &s;een to look at a &s;tranger, or even to hear an un|known voice without the greatest agony; and who, when any one &s;he did not know came into the hou&s;e, would frequently hide her&s;elf under the beds, or in the clo&s;ets, from the pur&s;uit of tho&s;e emi&s;&s;aries of her hu&s;band, who &s;he fancied were perpetually following her. D'Imonville, his wife and niece, left nothing untried to re-a&s;&s;ure her: they carried her from their own hou&s;e to one in the r&uuml;e de Mazarine, fauxb&oacute;urgh St. Germain, which was inhabited by mademoi&s;elle du Clos, where the name of the chevalier du Coudrey was ex|changed for that of the chevalier des Marets, Robert farther a&s;&s;erted, that his wife, now a pupil of the &s;chool of La du Clos, by de|grees
<PB N="263" REF="036316_0263_1008DAB114850570">
forgot her terrors, and became initiated In the gallantries which pa&s;&s;ed at the hou&s;e of the actre&s;s, with whom &s;he was a great fa|vourite. D'Imonville had a villa at Combe-de-la-Ville, where frequent parties of plea&s;ure were made, at which mademoi&s;elle du Clos pre&s;ided, and which were enlivened by the talents and &s;pirit of the chevalier des Marets. Hunting, balls, and plea&s;ures of the table, where liberty and gaity only were con&s;ulted, failed not to attract to this villa the young and licentious among the rich and great. To tho&s;e who were not in the &s;ecret, the chevalier &s;eemed the mo&s;t amiable of men: but to tho&s;e who were admitted to greater intimacy, he appeared more captivating, as a young wo|man of beauty and &s;pirit, who&s;e adventures and digui&s;e gave greater eclat to the charms of which nature had been &s;o lavi&s;h. She now appeared under the name of the chevalier de Mor&s;an; and the &s;ieur Mars de Joigny often went to this hou&s;e, at Combe-de-la-Ville. It happened that he arrived there one day, when a large company was a&s;&s;embled, and entering ha&s;tily the room where they were, he &s;o far forgot him&s;elf, as to &s;ay to the chevalier de Mor&s;an, "Well, Charlotte, how are you to-day?" This occa&s;ioned a loud laugh among tho&s;e who were acquainted with the meta|morpho&s;is, and excited the wonder of tho&s;e who were not: the&s;e la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> endeavouring to gain more intelligence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">m the &s;ieur de Joigny, he

ha&s;tily put an end to the conver&s;ation.&mdash;This circum&s;tance, the frequent change of name, and the my&s;terious &s;tories that were told of the birth of the chevalier de Mor&s;an, rai&s;ed great curio&s;ity in the minds of many, who had &s;een him with La du Clos or the &s;ieur d'Imon|ville. Sometimes he was &s;aid to be a fo|reigner, travelling for improvement; &s;ome|times the &s;on of a prince, who was for rea&s;ons of &s;tate obliged to be concealed. The curate of Combe-de-la-Ville, who once &s;aw him in the bed u&s;ually occupied by madame d'Imon|ville, expre&s;&s;ed his &s;u&s;picions of his &s;ex; the chevalier turned him into ridicule, and re|fu&s;ed to an&s;wer his enquiries. But the &s;ervants of the hou&s;e, and &s;everal other per&s;ons, had no doubt but that the pretended young man was a woman. After Charlotte Donc had for &s;ome time worn the ma&s;culine habit, &s;he &s;eemed to have acquired ma&s;culine courage: &s;he had a quarrel with &s;ome young man in the neigh|bourhood of Combe-de-la-Ville, accepted his challenge and was actually wounded. The &s;urgeon, however, who dre&s;&s;ed the wound, was never called upon in the trial. It was not long afterwards that &s;he came to Paris, to a hou&s;e La du Clos had taken in the r&uuml;e Mazarine; there &s;he was &s;eized with the &s;mall pox, attended with the wor&s;t &s;ymptoms: and, in the danger of lo&s;ing her life, all the tran&s;actions of that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;eized on her di&s;or|dered imagination: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ince&s;&s;antly implored

the attendants to &s;ave her from her hu&s;band; and fancied &s;he &s;aw her&s;elf &s;urrounded by &s;ol|diers, who were come to drag her to him. As the di&s;ea&s;e approached the cri&s;is, it wore the mo&s;t threatening a&s;pect: &s;piritual con&s;o|lation was thought nece&s;&s;ary; and father Con|&s;tant, a monk of the Augu&s;tines, was &s;ent for to admini&s;ter the &s;acraments, and hear the dying confe&s;&s;ion of the chevalier de Mor&s;an. The monk addre&s;&s;ed him as &s;uch; but the hour was now come in which di&s;&s;imulation was impo&s;&s;ible. The pretended chevalier &s;aid to the monk, in a melancholy tone, <Q>Alas! I am not what you &s;uppo&s;e: I am a woman.</Q> The monk, a&s;toni&s;hed at what he heard, exclaimed&mdash;"How! are you a wo|man?" On which the patient repeated a &s;econd time, "Yes; I am a woman." The monk then a&s;ked her if &s;he would have him reveal this &s;ecret to mademoi&s;elle du Clos? To which &s;he an&s;wered, <Q>Yes, tell her if you wlll.</Q>&mdash;Either the prie&s;t was not aware of the immediate danger, or for &s;ome other rea|&s;on, he delayed the la&s;t &s;acrament and confe&s;|&s;ion till the next morning: in the interim the chevalier expired.&mdash;The deception, however, did not terminate with life: Michelle de la Neau, and her daughter, the former who had attended as a nur&s;e during the illne&s;s, the latter who was &s;ervant to mademoi&s;elle du Clos, were employed to put the corp&s;e into the coffin. They &s;aw that it was the corp&s;e of
<PB N="266" REF="036316_0266_1008DB047B95C0F0">
a woman: they expre&s;&s;ed to La du Clos their &s;urprize; who coldly an&s;wered, that &s;ince it was &s;o, the world, who had accu&s;ed her of entertaining the chevalier as a lover, had wronged her, and had been deceived. The coffin, &s;et on a bier, was placed at the door of La du Clos; and, to perpetuate the deceit, the &s;word of the decea&s;ed, and its &s;cabbard, were laid on the coffin, as is u&s;ual when a military man is buried. The &s;pectators be|lieved it was the funeral of an officer; and Charlotte Donc was buried as a chevalier, after having pa&s;&s;ed as &s;uch for &s;even years. The &s;ieur d'Imonville, who Robert pretended was the principal contriver of the concealment, attended the funeral.&mdash;When the entry was made in the regi&s;ter of this funeral, a note was added, thus, "You are not to &s;uffer an extract of this to be taken."</P>
<P>If this relation, given by Robert, was true, his wife was among the dead &s;even years be|fore he was appri&s;ed of it; and &s;he had been lo&s;t near fifteen, when by &s;ome means or other (but by what does not appear) he gained in|telligence of the di&s;gui&s;e in which &s;he had lived. Seizing eagerly on a clue which promi&s;ed to lead him to the di&s;covery he had &s;o long attempted in vain, he pur&s;ued his enquiries at Combe-de-la-Ville, and at Paris, among every rank of people with whom D'Imonville and du Clos were connected, till he had collected the cir|cum&s;tances from which he formed this nar|rative:
<PB N="267" REF="036316_0267_1008DAB8EE44AA60">
and in this re&s;earch he had been a&s;|&s;i&s;ted by Anthony Donc, the brother of Char|lotte; who being, in ca&s;e of her death, heir to whatever his father had left, was equally intere&s;ted in penetrating the my&s;tery. Their united enquiries produced fact, which, they affirmed, made a po&s;itive di&s;covery of the death and interment of Charlotte Donc,&mdash;Having a collection of proofs, which they thought &s;uf|ficient to e&s;tabli&s;h the facts, they no longer he&s;itated to lay it before a court of ju&s;tice. Thirteen witne&s;&s;es were examined, who&s;e evidence amounted to what has been before related&mdash;That an individual, who was believed to be a woman, had lived with La du Clos for &s;ome years; who was at fir&s;t called the che|valier du Coudray, afterwards des Marets; but latterly had been known by the name of the chevalier de Mor&s;an; and who was &s;up|po&s;ed to be Charlotte Donc, the fugitive wife of Robert. The nur&s;e, who had attended her in her la&s;t illne&s;s, &s;wore to the circum&s;tance of her apprehending that &s;oldiers &s;urrounded her bed to force her to her hu&s;band; and that, on laying her out, &s;he was found to be a wo|man. The &s;ervants who had lived with La du Clos, the Augu&s;tine monk, and &s;ome other witne&s;&s;es, gave te&s;timony of tho&s;e facts which have been before recapitulated: but none &s;wore po&s;itively, that the per&s;on pa&s;&s;ing under the name of the chevalier de Mor&s;an, was Charlotte Donc. But Robert pretended, that

the time when his wife di&s;appeared, an|&s;wered exactly to that when the &s;tranger fir&s;t was &s;een in the &s;ociety of de Joigny, the guardian, du Clos, D'Imonville, and others with whom de Joigny was connected; which, added to the te&s;timonies of &s;o many witne&s;&s;es, and to circum&s;tances &s;o unu&s;ual, mu&s;t con|vince the court, that the chevalier de Mor&s;an was no other than the wife of Robert.&mdash;The coun&s;el for Robert, in pleading on this ground, again&s;t tho&s;e who had concealed his wife, re|pre&s;ented the enormity of the offence they had committed, again&s;t all law and order, as well as again&s;t religion and ju&s;tice. They &s;aid, that not content with having &s;tolen the wife from her hu&s;band, to whom &s;he was di|rected to return, and having led her into an irregular and &s;candalous cour&s;e of life; with having impo&s;ed on the world, and violated the laws of &s;ociety, by the di&s;gui&s;e under which &s;he had lived, and under which &s;he had been buried; they dared to enter a fal&s;ity into a book kept for the &s;ecurity of that &s;o|ciety: in which if frauds were thus allowed, no man's property could be &s;afe from the at|tacks of pretenders; no man could venture to be&s;tow his daughter or his &s;i&s;ter in mar|riage, or to marry him&s;elf: and, in &s;hort, it was a fraud that &s;truck at the very root of &s;ocial compact and good order. But &s;o con|&s;cious were they of the probability of detec|tion from this quarter, that they tried to pre|vent

an extract from being taken from a book, which, in fact, belonged to the whole com|munity, by in&s;erting in the margin a note, more likely however to excite curio&s;ity, than to prevent its being gratified; &s;ince, if it was really the body of the chevalier de Mor&s;an which was interred, why &s;hould it be con|cealed? In fal&s;ifying the name and &s;ex of the per&s;on buried, they were guilty of a capital crime; the puni&s;hment for which is a confi&s;cation of all the effects of the contending parties.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur Bri&s;&s;on, coun&s;el for D'Joigny, D'Imonville, and du Clos, undertook, in op|po&s;ition to the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions, to prove, that the per&s;on who had lived &s;o long with La du Clos, was not Charlotte Donc, but the chevalier de Mor&s;an, a foreigner; who&s;e exi&s;tence ad|mitted of no doubt, and who&s;e hi&s;tory he could without difficulty trace. He &s;aid, that the abb&eacute; Chamillard, a Je&s;uit, had been ac|quainted with this young man in Bavaria, of which country he was a native; that, in 1715, he came to Paris, and told the abb&eacute; Chamil|lard, to whom he immediately addre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf, that affairs of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence had obliged him to quit his country, and come into France. The abb&eacute;, affected by his mi&s;|fortunes, undertook to find for him a proper &s;ituation, and to do him all the &s;ervice in his power. In con&s;equence he introduced him to madame Royer, with whom he was much
<PB N="270" REF="036316_0270_1008DB0A74CD8C30">
acquainted, and de&s;ired her to look out for an a&s;ylum for this young &s;tranger; who, thereupon, engaged her uncle D'Imonville to receive him into his hou&s;e, a&s;&s;uring him that the abb&eacute; Chamillard knew the time would come, when it would be in his power to repay his kindne&s;s with intere&s;t. The &s;ieur D'Im|onville, who from this under&s;tood he was a &s;tranger of illu&s;trious birth, willingly offered him his hou&s;e and his pur&s;e; and he conti|nued with him for &s;ome time. At fir&s;t, he told his protector, that he was the &s;on of Maximilian de Mor&s;an and Emily de Con|&s;tance; and that an affair, which he could not reveal without great prejudice to him&s;elf, had obliged him to leave Munich. By this means he evaded for &s;ome time the que&s;tions which were put to him: but at length, &s;en|&s;ible of the kindne&s;s with which he was treated in the hou&s;e of D'Imonville, and the repeated acts of friend&s;hip he had experienced from him and his family, he told them he would no longer conceal his real hi&s;tory from them, e&s;pecially as he had hopes of being very &s;oon in a &s;ituation to &s;hew his gratitude for their attention to him. "You have," continued he, "proved your attachment to me beyond a doubt, and are worthy of all my confidence; I will not therefore conceal from you, that I am the natural &s;on of the elector of Bavaria; who my mother was, I have never been &s;o happy as to learn." The &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur D'Imonville,

charmed with this confidence, and to find that he had been of u&s;e to the &s;on of a &s;ove|reign prince, redoubled his attentions: he thought it no breach of confidence to reveal to the abb&eacute; Chamillard what he had heard; who an&s;wered, "What you now tell me, I have long known: I a&s;&s;ured you, when I fir&s;t introduced this young man to your ac|quaintance, that he was of high birth, and I did not deceive you. I am happy in having been the means of your forming a connection, which cannot fail to enrich you. His affairs at pre&s;ent are in a train, that affords him a pro&s;pect of very &s;oon acquitting him&s;elf to|wards you." D'Imonville, his wife, and niece, concluded that the affair which was in agita|tion was a de&s;ign of the elector of Bavaria to legitimate his &s;on. Some months pa&s;&s;ed away, during which the family removed to another hou&s;e, the fir&s;t floor of which was inhabited by mademoi&s;elle du Clos, the celebrated co|median, with whom they became acquainted. In 1719, the chevalier de Mor&s;an told mon&s;ieur D'Imonville, that his affairs were now nearly &s;et|tled; that they were likely to &s;ucceed beyond his hope<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, but that it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to &s;hew him&s;elf at Munich: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> be &s;ought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the la&s;t favour he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> which would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> repay all the re&s;t: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> that this was a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> journey.

could not him&s;elf rai&s;e the &s;um required; but he borrowed of a notary two thou&s;and three hundred livres. He purcha&s;ed for the chevalier proper clothes to appears in at Munich, and a po&s;t-chai&s;e; and, after having made the&s;e preparations, expected that he &s;hould depart: but the young man, when he &s;aw every thing ready, could not re&s;olve to go; he had a love engagement, which he had not re&s;olution to break through; and he contrived every day &s;ome new excu&s;e to delay his journey. D'Imonville, who had formed &s;anguine expectations of the future power and wealth of the chevalier, was extremely cha|grined at this negligence, after all the exer|tions he had made for him; and he re&s;olved to remon&s;trate &s;eriou&s;ly with him on the folly of his conduct. The chevalier, on being pre&s;&s;ed by D'Imonville to name an early day for his journey, had no longer any pretence to delay it; but he flew into a pa&s;&s;ion, and words grew high between them. La du Clos who was in the apartment beneath, herd the noi&s;e, and came up to enquire what was the matter. The &s;ieur d'Imonville explained the &s;ubject of their conte&s;t; and &s;aid, he had now made his la&s;t effort on the chevalier whereupon La du Clos, addre&s;&s;ing the young man, &s;aid to him, "My dear child, &s;ince mon&s;ieur d'Imonville can do no more for you, you &s;hall come and live with me, and I will take care of you." The chevalier, tran&s;ported

at having found &s;o charming a protectre&s;s, accepted the offer La du Clos made him; who gave him an apartment on the floor &s;he inhabited, and from that time &s;upported him entirely, and even lent him money to repay the advance made by D'Imonville; who&s;e re|mon&s;trance he &s;oon cea&s;ed to re&s;ent, and they continued to live in friend&s;hip, as before this little di&s;agreement. In 1722 he was de|&s;irous of entering into the army, and &s;erved for &s;ome time as a cadet, in the company of the chevalier de Malherbe. But his friends repre&s;enting to him, that the duty of a &s;oldier was incompatible with the atten|tion his private affairs required, he &s;oon afterwards, re&s;igned. Till 1723, he lived very much in company, and was well received in the mo&s;t brilliant parties in the neighbour|hood of St. Germain.

But in the month of November of that year he was &s;eized with the &s;mall-pox, which &s;oon appeared to be of the wor&s;t &s;ort. The fever attending it deprived him of his &s;en|&s;es, many days before his death; and in that &s;ituation he was vi&s;ited by father Con&s;tant, who found it too late to admini&s;ter the &s;a|crement&punc; and on the tenth of November the &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur d'Imonville paid him the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;t tribut of friend&s;hip, by attending his remains to the grave.</P>

Such was the hi&s;tory related by mon&s;ieur Bri&s;&s;on, for his clients; who&s;e purpo&s;e it was to prove, that the individual pa&s;&s;ing under the name of the chevalier de Mor&s;an, was not a woman; and certainly not Charlotte Donc, the wife of Robert.</P>
<P>The &s;econd wife of Robert, who&s;e hope was, that, if the death of Charlotte Donc could not be proved, Robert would be deemed guilty of bigamy, and that &s;he &s;hould by that means be relea&s;ed from her engagement with him, had collected every circum&s;tance that could &s;trengthen the belief of the chevalier de Mor&s;an being really the per&s;on he repre&s;ented. In oppo&s;ition to the witne&s;&s;es brought by the other party, &s;he produced per&s;ons who gave their te&s;timony to many particulars of the life of the chevalier de Mor&s;an. He was fond of violent exerci&s;e; under&s;tood fencing, the back-&s;word, hunting, and &s;hooting; and was a judge of hor&s;es. He was known to have pa&s;&s;ed whole days in field &s;ports; a degree of fatigue which no woman could have under|gone: and he frequently played matches at tennis, which kept him in extreme exerci&s;e for many hours. The hu&s;bands and fathers where De Mor&s;an vi&s;ited, were &s;o f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r from &s;uppo&s;ing him to be a woman, that many of them had rea&s;on to complain of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> for his per&s;on was extremely hand&s;ome, and he was univer&s;ally admired.

Many other particulars were brought, to prove that there was no analogy between Charlotte Donc and the chevalier de Mor&s;an.</P>
<P>The court, after hearing many arguments on both &s;ides, could not find any po&s;itive proof that the &s;ieurs de Joigny and D'Imon|ville, with madame Royer and du Clos, had &s;ecreted Charlotte Donc, and buried her un|der a fal&s;e name.&mdash;On the other hand, as the &s;econd wife of Robert could produce no proof of her being alive, either when Robert mar|ried a &s;econd time, or at the time &s;he &s;ued him, they would not condemn Robert for bigamy; who&s;e &s;econd marriage, therefore, remained good in law: and the truth of this extraordinary affair continued unknown. The fate of the unfortunate Charlotte Donc was at all events deplorable. Whatever errors the peculiarity of her &s;ituation might have driven her into, were &s;olely imputable to the cruelty and mi&s;conduct of her mother.&mdash;Dreadful is the lot of a woman, driven into an indi&s;&s;oluble union with a wicked or worth|less man, at an age when keen &s;en&s;ibilities make her fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l all the mi&s;ery of &s;uch a union; while re&s;ignation and patience, which time only can give, have not enabled her to &s;ubdue the violent emotions which &s;uch a pro&s;pect

<P>IN a former part of this volume is related the &s;tory of the unfortunate D'Anglade, who pe|ri&s;hed in mi&s;ery and ignominy, through the pre|judice of an unju&s;t judge, and the malice of an inveterate pro&s;ecutor. The following narra|tive is another in&s;tance of the fallibility of hu|man judgment; and, though the unfortunate &s;ufferer was in an inferior rank of life, his fate was, if po&s;&s;ible, more to be deplored than that of D'Anglade.</P>
<P>Madame Mazel was a woman who had pa&s;&s;ed the meridian of life: &s;he was a widow, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an affluent fortune; and had three &s;ons, all well e&s;tabli&s;hed. Ren&eacute;, the elde&s;t, was a coun&s;ellor of parliament; George, the &s;econd, trea&s;urer of France, for the di&s;trict of Paris; and Michael, the younge&s;t, major of the regiment of Piedmont.</P>
<P>But though her family were pro&s;perous, they were not happy. Madame Mazel had taken an aver&s;ion to the wife of her elde&s;t &s;on; and had cau&s;ed her to be confined in a convent, by an order from the king: and this &s;he had intere&s;t enough to affect, though her
<PB N="278" REF="036316_0278_1008DB18203F0CF8">
&s;on him&s;elf by no means lent her any a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance. The lady had contrived often to e&s;cape from her confinement, and had as often been forced back by the machinations of her mo|ther-in-law; whom, of cour&s;e, &s;he hated mo&s;t inveterately. The conduct of madame Mazel her&s;elf, was &s;uch as &s;eemed but little to au|thori&s;e the power &s;he a&s;&s;umed to puni&s;h that of another: &s;he had gaming-tables con&s;tantly in her hou&s;e, and a man called the abb&eacute; Pou|lard lived with her on a footing, of intimacy, which did no honour to her reputation.</P>
<P>This lady's &s;ervants, in her hotel at Paris, were, two footmen, both lads between &s;ix|teen and eighteen years old; an old female cook; a coachman; two young women who waited on her per&s;on; and James le Brun, who had lived with her twenty-nine years, and who was now her butler, intendant, and ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel: he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all her confidence, and de&s;erved it by his attachment to her in|tere&s;t, and his general integrity, which had re|commended him to the e&s;teem of all who fre|quented the hou&s;e. His mi&s;tre&s;s left to him all her receipts and payments; and never, in all the &s;ums that pa&s;&s;ed through his hands, was there the lea&s;t deficiency or mi&s;take. The trade&s;men, whom he paid regularly, and every other per&s;on connected with the affairs of ma|dame Mazel, &s;poke highly of his hone&s;ty and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ntere&s;ted conduct; and, among other in|&s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ces of unblemi&s;hed integrity, it was
<PB N="279" REF="036316_0279_1008DACAB0DDDF58">
related of him, that one evening, after very deep play had been held it his mi&s;tre&s;s's hou&s;e, he, on clearing the apartments, found a &s;um of money, the owner of which (who did not know the &s;um &s;he had lo&s;t, or what &s;he had done with it) he took pains to di&s;cover, and returned her the whole. Le Brun had a wife and five children, and was the be&s;t of hu&s;bands and of fathers. His two elde&s;t daughters were of that bu&s;ine&s;s which is in France termed co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ffeu&s;es; which rather an|&s;wers to our idea of the tire-women of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> la&s;t century, than to any attendant we have at pre&s;ent. In this employment they acquired reputation, not only for their &s;kill, but their decent and regular manners: and their father, who had brought them up &s;oberly and religi|ou&s;ly, was &s;o de&s;irous of their morals being pre&s;erved, that though his mi&s;tre&s;s, who&s;e hotel was much larger than &s;he had occa&s;ion for, offered him an apartment in it for his whole family, he rather cho&s;e to hire an ha|bitation for them, than to have his daughters in a hou&s;e where game&s;ters, and other di&s;&s;olute and idle people, were perpetually vi&s;iting.&mdash;Such was the character of this unfortunate man, James le Brun.</P>
<P>That of the abb&eacute; Poulard, the intimate of madame Mazel, was far from being equally re&s;pectable. This man, who had taken his vows in the order of jacobins, had lived among them for &s;ome years; and then, by a bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

from the pope &s;urreptitiou&s;ly obtained, he quit|ted that &s;ociety, to enter into the order of Cluny: but, in&s;tead of doing &s;o, he became the compa|nion and confidential friend of madame Mazel.</P>
<P>Admitted to a table where luxury and pro|fu&s;ion reigned, the abb&eacute; forgot the rules of his profe&s;&s;ion, and was &s;o far from keeping any maigre days, that he critici&s;ed, &s;ome|times with the a&s;perity of a gluttonous ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, on &s;uch di&s;hes as were not pre|pared to his ta&s;te. His bed-chamber was on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> third floor, &s;umptuou&s;ly furni&s;hed with a bed of blue velvet, lined with crim&s;on &s;ilk, and every other article proportionably rich.

Nor was he much more affected by an order given by the advocate-general to the jacobins, to &s;eize and confine him.

By means of this man, George, the &s;econd &s;on of madame Mazel, who was known by the name of the &s;ieigneur de Lignieres, became acquainted with his &s;i&s;ter, the widow of a coun&s;ellor of Mans, who&s;e beauty had made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on the heart of the &s;ieur de Lignie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es, in&s;omuch that he had promi&s;ed to marry her: a match the mo&s;t fortunate for her, and therefore greatly wi&s;hed for by her, and her brother the abb&eacute;, but oppo&s;ed by madame Mazel.

<P>The fourth &s;tory had only two rooms oc|cupied; one by the two footmen, who were brothers, and the other by the two waiting-women, who were &s;i&s;ters.

A window in the roof opened to the ridge of the hou&s;e, between which ran a gutter, that continued for four or five hou&s;es adjoining, mo&s;t of which were lodging hou&s;es. On the ground floor was the kitchen and a little wood room.

<P>On the 27th November, 1698, being the fir&s;t Sunday in advent, the two daughters of Le <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">run went in the afternoon to pay their re&s;pects to madame Mazel. She received them with her u&s;ual good-humour, but de|&s;ired they would come &s;ome other day, when they could pa&s;s longer time with her, as &s;he was then going to ve&s;pers at the convent of Pr&eacute;mentr&eacute;, r&uuml;e Hautefeuille&mdash;for &s;he was ever remarkably punctilio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> in the exerci&s;es of religion. She left her hou&s;e, attended by Le Brun, on who&s;e arm &s;he leant, and the two footman followed her. As &s;oon as &s;he was in the chapel Le Brun quitted her, and went to hear ve&s;pers him&s;elf at the Jacobins, r&uuml;e St. Jacques; from thence he went to &s;ee a game at bowls, where he met a lock&s;mith, called Lagu&euml;, who had married a &s;ervant of madame Mazel's; and they went together to a cook's &s;hop, where they purcha&s;ed &s;ome provi&s;ions, on which they intended to &s;up together; then Le Brun went home to his mi&s;tre&s;s's hotel, and from thence to his wife's lodging, and, at eight o'clock, he went with the coach, and the other footmen, to fetch

<P>Madame Mazel &s;upped, according to her u&s;ual cu&s;tom, with the abb&eacute; Poulard, t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te. The &s;ervants, who waited at table, re|marked, that he repeated &s;everal times his in|tention of going that night to his lodging in the neighbourhood, though he never before had mentioned what he intended to do of an evening. At eleven o'clock, madame Mazel went to her chamber; and her two women had not quitted her, when Le Brun tapped at the back door of the room. She a&s;ked who it was? and one of the maids an&s;wered it is mr. Le Brun. Le Brun, finding the door not im|mediately opened, went down, and came round by the great &s;tair-ca&s;e to the other door. When he entered the apartment, madame Mazel &s;aid to him, "Truly, this is a fine hour to come for orders!"&mdash;meaning that he had &s;taid out later than was his cu&s;tom; &s;he then told him what &s;he would have provided for &s;upper the next evening, which was the night on which &s;he kept open table. The maid, as was her u&s;ual method, put the key on the chair; after which they all quitted the room; and Le Brun, who went la&s;t, drew the door after him and &s;hut it. As they (the three &s;ervants) were going down together, Le Brun &s;topped the two young women, to tell them

how kind his mi&s;tre&s;s had been to his daugh|ters, when they waited on her in the after|noon, and after keeping them in conver&s;ation &s;ome minutes, he wi&s;hed them a good night; the whole of his behaviour te&s;tifying his u&s;ual chearfulne&s;s and &s;erenity.</P>
<P>He then went into the kitchen to take the key of the outward door to lock it; he took it off the hook, but, finding him&s;elf cold, he laid it down on the table, while he warmed him|&s;elf, and being fatigued, po&s;&s;ibly too, having drank more than he was accu&s;tomed to, he in&s;en&s;ibly fell a&s;leep. When he awoke he heard the clock &s;trike one; but knew not whe|ther it was one o'clock, or the la&s;t &s;troke of twelve, or of any other hour. He ran up to lock the outward door (which he was &s;urprized to find wide open), and, when he had done &s;o, took the key with him into his room; a pre|caution he had &s;eldom before taken. The next morning, being the 28th of November, he got up at the u&s;ual hour to buy provi&s;ions, and went to the butcher's.

It was by this time eight o'clock, and madame Mazel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">lly aro&s;e at &s;even. The &s;ervants expre&s;&s;ed to each other their wonder, that &s;he had not rung her bell at her accu&s;tomed time. Le Brun went out a moment to &s;ee his wife; to whom he gave &s;even louis and &s;ome other money, which he bade her lock up. Then returning home, he enquired if madame was yet up? and being told &s;he was not, he ex|pre&s;&s;ed &s;urprize and unea&s;ine&s;s. That of the whole family now aro&s;e to &s;uch a height, that they determined to endeavour to awaken her, and for that purpo&s;e they went to the door, rapped loudly, and called.

Some &s;aid &s;he had fallen into an apoplexy; others, that a bleeding at the no&s;e, to which &s;he was &s;ubject, had de|&s;troyed her; but Le Brun remarked, that it mu&s;t be &s;omething wor&s;e,&mdash;"Something," &s;aid he, <Q>is wrong; I am very unea&s;y, be|cau&s;e I found the &s;treet-door open la&s;t night.</Q></P>

<P>The room being at length opened, the peo|ple who were a&s;&s;embled entered: Le Brun went ha&s;tily to his mi&s;tre&s;s's bed;&mdash;&s;he was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, and bathed in blood.

The cords of the bells were twi&s;ted up above the reach of the hand, and tied to the curtain rod. In the a&s;hes was found a knife, &s;even or eight inches long, the handle of which had been of tortoi&s;e-&s;hell, but was nearly burnt. The key of the chamber-door was not found on the &s;eat, where the waiting woman affirmed &s;he had put it; no door was broke; and the two doors, which opened to the back&s;tairs were both &s;hut and hooked within&s;ide.

<P>The next day the lieutenant returned again to the hou&s;e of the decea&s;ed, to examine the cook, the two footmen, and the coachman; but, though he employed ten hours in the&s;e interrogations, he omitted to examine an old woman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">And who is not mentioned before among the inhabi|tants of the hou&s;e.</NOTE> who lay in the kitchen.</P>
<P>There was found at the bottom of the back &s;tairs, a new rope, tied to an iron hook, and knotted as if it was de&s;igned for a ladder.

<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pleading on behalf of Le Brun.</NOTE> Mon&s;ieur d'Ancour, who was employed in favour of Le Brun, made an excellent, though fruitle&s;s defence. He began with &s;hewing, how improbable it was, that a man of &s;o excellent a character as Le Brun univer|&s;ally bore; a man who had brought up a large family in hone&s;t and &s;ober principles; who&s;e conduct, as a hu&s;band and a father, was un|impeached; and who had faithfully &s;erved his mi&s;tre&s;s nine-and-twenty years; &s;hould now, without motive, without provocation, become the murderer of her, to whom he had &s;o long &s;hewn the &s;incere&s;t attachment and re&s;pect: the&s;e circum&s;tances made the fact extremely improbable. The next point was to &s;hew, that it was impo&s;&s;ible Le Brun could be guilty of if. The report of tho&s;e who in&s;pected the body of the decea&s;ed, &s;aid, that &s;he had re|ceived above fifty wounds, and had evidently made great re&s;i&s;tance; in con&s;equence of which, the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in mu&s;t have borne on his per|&s;on many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of that re&s;i&s;tance. Le Brun had none; not even the &s;malle&s;t &s;cratch on his hands, or &s;pot of blood on his clothes:&mdash;the towel, twi&s;ted up like a cap, was &s;o much le&s;s than his head, that he could not put it on: the knife was not his; had never been &s;een in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion:&mdash;the neckcloth was known to
<PB N="298" REF="036316_0298_1008DB66B4EE8D68">
belong to another per&s;on:&mdash;the &s;hirt was not like any he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; it was unlike, not only in quality, but in &s;ize; and was made for a little man, whereas Le Brun was very tall and robu&s;t. &mdash; The&s;e facts, &s;aid M. d'Aucour, are &s;o evident, that the accu&s;ers of my client can|not deny them; forced, therefore, to ac|knowledge that he cannot have been the actual perpetrator of the crime, they have re|cour&s;e to another charge; and accu&s;e him of being an accomplice. But this charge, con|tinued M. d'Aucour, is even more ab&s;urd than the other. If any unaccountable frenzy could have in&s;tigated Le Brun to &s;uch a deed, he would not have tru&s;ted the execution of it to another hand: if he had been prompted by avarice, he would, as he had time enough, have &s;ecured the large &s;um, in money and jewels, which were left behind, and not have contented him&s;elf with a &s;mall part only of what he had ri&s;qued &s;o much to obtain. He would certainly have e&s;caped before the next morning, in&s;tead of going, as he did, uncon|cernedly about his u&s;ual bu&s;ine&s;s. But if any dome&s;tic let in the ru&s;&s;ian, why mu&s;t it be Le Brun? Why not one of the other footmen, or maids? Why not the coachman in who&s;e care the court-yard was left? Why not the cook, who had al&s;o a ma&s;ter-key to the outward door, and in who&s;e room was a low window, communicating with the &s;treet, through which &s;he might give the

ma&s;ter-key out? Finally, Why might it not be the abb&eacute; Poulard, who&s;e character was &s;uch as made him be &s;uppo&s;ed a much more likely man than Le Brun to commit an infa|mous crime.&mdash;But why mu&s;t it be concluded, that the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in was let in at all? Of a hou&s;e open at all times to game&s;ters of both &s;exes, and to crowds of &s;ervants who attended them, it is not difficult to know the entrance, and the pa&s;&s;ages. Might not the wretch, who medi|tated murder and robbery, conceal him&s;elf in the hou&s;e during the day, when all the doors were open to all comers? Might he not have remained there one night, or even more, hid among the &s;traw, coals, and wood, in the garret, which was rarely frequented? Might he not even have come in by means of the trap-door, which opened in the roof, and which was never &s;hut? And was there not &s;ufficient temptation to villany, in a hou&s;e which was known to have a hoard of gold never le&s;s than two thou&s;and pi&s;toles, be&s;ides other monies; and which was &s;o ea&s;y of ac|ce&s;s?&mdash;There being, therefore, every rea&s;on to believe the crime was not committed by the intervention of a &s;ervant; or, if of a &s;ervant, not of Le Brun; M. d'Aucour demanded, on behalf of his client, that he might be declared innocent, and &s;et at liberty.</P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding this able defence, and that his adver&s;aries could bring no one proof again&s;t him, no one pre&s;umptive evi|dence,

the fatal key in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which opened all the doors, determined the judges to condemn him. A yet more powerful motive, perhaps, was, the wi&s;h of the me&s;&s;ieurs de Savonnieres to have him condemned! They therefore proceeded, on the eighteenth of January, to judgment. Eleven judges were a&s;&s;embled: of whom two declared, they re|quired farther information before they de|cided; two voted that he might be put to the que&s;tion;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By torture</NOTE> &s;ix condemned him to death, and that in the mo&s;t cruel manner that could be devi&s;ed.</P>
<P>Poor Le Brun was extremely beloved; and the murmurs and complaints of the people, who all believed him innocent, reached the ears of the judges. They &s;aid, in their de|fence, that as they knew their deci&s;ion would not be final, but would be appealed again&s;t, and carried to another court, they determined to make it as &s;evere as po&s;&s;ible, in hopes of frightening the pri&s;oner into a confe&s;&s;ion of the actual perpetrator of the crime, and all its circum&s;tances. Thus, in&s;tead of ju&s;tice, the&s;e men had recour&s;e to &s;tratagem. Le Brun appealed;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">But to what court, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Richar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to tell us.&mdash;The court of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> was that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Le Brun was fir&s;t condemned.</NOTE> and M. d'Aucour, on the &s;econd hearing, undertook his defence anew.</P>
<P>He again urged all that he had before &s;et
<PB N="301" REF="036316_0301_1008DB3ACDE97660">
forth, in behalf of his oppre&s;&s;ed client; and &s;et all the improbabilities, he had before re|marked, in a yet &s;tronger light. He repre|&s;ented, that no one circum&s;tance could be al|leged again&s;t him, but the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a key which turned half round the lock of the apartment where madame Mazel lay: and on &s;uch &s;light pre&s;umption they condemned to die, by the mo&s;t cruel torments, a man, who for five-and-forty years (of which twenty-nine had been pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame &s;ervice) had never been accu&s;ed of the lea&s;t offence again&s;t God or man! The fatal key, which is thus to bring him to the &s;caffold, not only was not &s;urreptiou&s;ly obtained, but had undergone no alteration to enable it to turn the lock en|tirely; a precaution Le Brun mu&s;t have taken, had he meant to have u&s;ed it to enter his mi&s;|tre&s;s's room, after &s;he was in bed; for then the door was double locked, and this key, which would only turn once, was con&s;equently unfit for the purpo&s;e. It was objected, by the accu&s;ers of Le Brun, that he ought not to have kept this key; for that madame Mazel, after being robbed by Berry, had taken away the ma&s;ter-keys from all her &s;ervants who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them. It is true, continues M. d'Aucour, &s;he did in a fit of vexation, very natural, yet not very rea&s;onable, take away from the cook, and from Le Brun, their ma&s;ter keys. But &s;he &s;oon after gave back to the cook that which &s;he had taken from her; and
<PB N="302" REF="036316_0302_1008DB3EB15B0A50">
as &s;he had given that which Le Brun u&s;ed to carry to the abb&eacute; Poulard, &s;he &s;uffered him (Le Brun) to u&s;e that he had by him, and which had been given him many years before, by a &s;ervant who married out of the family; and Le Brun always did u&s;e it, not only with the knowledge of all the other dome&s;tics, but of his mi&s;tre&s;s her&s;elf; indeed it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for him, as he bought all the provi&s;ions for the family, and was obliged to be at market in a morning long before the re&s;t of the family were &s;tirring.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, had Le Brun lent the key to the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, he would not have taken it back. He would have &s;uffered him to have kept it, or have thrown it away, under pretence that he had him&s;elf lo&s;t it. It is inconceivable that he would retain what would be brought in evidence gain&s;t him.</P>
<P>But why, pur&s;ued M. d'Aucour, is not en|quiry made after Berry? Berry, who be|fore robbed madame Mazel, and was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed in di&s;grace; who was known to be an infa|mous wretch, capable of any mi&s;chief &mdash; to whom the neckcloth was known to belong; who had often applied to be admitted to his place again, but had been refu&s;ed; who was &s;een at Paris about the time the event hap|pened; and had been &s;een &s;ince with money, which could not have been hone&s;tly obtained?</P>

to none?&mdash;who had acce&s;s at all hours to the hou&s;e of madame Mazel, and who was &s;een to go in at midnight, the evening the mur|der was committed; and who had an intere&s;t in the death of his benefactre&s;s, who was an ob&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cle to the marriage of his &s;i&s;ter with her &s;econd &s;on? Why does the wife of the el|de&s;t &s;on, who&s;e inveterate hatred and frequent denunciations of vengeance again&s;t her mo|ther-in-law were well known; why is &s;he not &s;u&s;pected of having hired an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, to put an end to a life &s;o obnoxious to her? Any one of the&s;e per&s;ons, M. d'Aucour affirmed, were much more likely to be the perpetra|tors of the homicide than Le Brun, who&s;e in|tere&s;t it was that his mi&s;tre&s;s &s;hould live, not only becau&s;e he enjoyed an excellent place, but becau&s;e if &s;he did alter her will, as &s;he &s;ometimes &s;aid &s;he &s;hould, he had no rea&s;on to believe &s;he would le&s;&s;en his legacy, but rather to hope &s;he would increa&s;e it; as &s;he was continually be&s;towing additional favours on him and his family, and, as &s;he advanced in years, felt her&s;elf more and more attached to an old &s;ervant, careful of her intere&s;t, and who&s;e &s;ervices &s;he found every day more ne|ce&s;&s;ary, in her dome&s;tic arrangement.</P>
<P>When all the&s;e rea&s;ons were added to the univer&s;al good character of the accu&s;ed, the concern expre&s;&s;ed by all ranks of people for him (for all believed him innocent), and the total want of proof again&s;t him, M. d'Au|cour

pleaded, that &s;o far from the &s;entence being confirmed, it undoubtedly ought to be annulled. He again, before he concluded, pointed out to the court the extraordinary conduct of the abb&eacute; Poulard, who, with an officiou&s;ne&s;s very unju&s;tifiable, had labo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed by fal&s;ities, and injurious allegations, to throw the guilt on the unfortunate pri&s;oner.&mdash;But the abb&eacute; Poulard was not a &s;econd time que&s;|tion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d till it was too late.</P>

<P>On the twenty-&s;econd of February, &s;en|tence was again to be pa&s;&s;ed by twenty-two judges. Two only of the number demanded farther enquiry; the other twenty decided for the que&s;tion ordinary and extraordinary.</P>

But this alleviation of his mi&s;ery came too late.

<P>The dache&s;s de Choi&s;eul died of a rapid de|cline, in 1698, at the age of thirty-three; the duke married a &s;econd wife, by whom he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> children; and died in 1704, at the age of &s;ixty-eight.</P>
<P>He appears to have been a negligent and improvident father, having taken very little notice of his children while he lived, and di&s;|&s;ipated great part of the property they ought to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at his death.&mdash;When that event happened, his family and that of his fir&s;t wife met, to con&s;ider of the affairs of the two young ladies, his daughters, as two only were then believed to exi&s;t. Their e&s;tates and per&s;ons were put under the guardian&s;hip of their maternal uncle, the duke de la Val|li&eacute;re; and in every proceeding which the en|tangled &s;tate of their father's affairs made ne|ce&s;&s;ary, no men<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">on was made of more than two daughters.

<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e was found by means of cau&s;ing her&s;elf to be bapti&s;ed by the name of Augu&s;tina-Frances de Choi&s;eul; and, as the duke her father had been remarkably neglect|ful in regard to the bapti&s;m of his other daugh|ters (who were not bapti&s;ed till one was ele|ven,

<P><Q>That at the age of two years and a half, madame d'Hautefort brought the little de Choi&s;eul home to her own hou&s;e, where &s;he lived till the commencement of the &s;uit, and where the duke de la Valli&eacute;re, her uncle, continued to &s;ee and to acknowledge her as his niece; and though &s;he was u&s;ually known by the name of mademoi&s;elle St. Cyr, yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he was allowed to have a claim to that of de Choi&s;eul.</Q></P>

her governe&s;s, who was particularly charged with her education, under the direction of madame d'Hautefort; and la&s;tly offered to prove, that the duke de la Valli&eacute;re had ac|knowledged repeatedly, that the little girl, of whom madame d'Hautefort had the care, was the daughter of his &s;i&s;ter, the duche&s;s de Choi&s;eul.</P>
<P>To add &s;trength to this allegation, a letter was produced, written by the marchione&s;s de Tournon to the marchione&s;s d'Hautefort, which contained the&s;e words: <Q>I am very &s;orry, madame, that the ill health of ma|demoi&s;elle de St. Cyr prevents my &s;eeing you, as I have nothing more at heart than to a&s;&s;ure you of my gratitude. I wi&s;h no|thing more ardently than to &s;ee the affair you know of brought to a conclu&s;ion; it is certainly that which affects the health of our amiable &s;ong&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;My friend, of whom I have an high opinion (whom you &s;aw with me on Sunday, and who left me on your entrance, believing we had bu&s;ine&s;s), told me ye&s;terday that he wi&s;hed very much to &s;ee you here, to give you his opinion of the bu&s;ine&s;s, in which he &s;ees no difficulty; but in the management of which, able per&s;ons are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, and &s;uch he will name to you.

here on receiving notice; and, as I have re|ceived the vi&s;its of all my relations, we &s;hall not be interrupted.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I hope the child will be well; if not, &s;he mu&s;t come &s;ick. I &s;hall be charmed with this opportunity of conver&s;ing with you, and of a&s;&s;uring you of my tender attachment. Suf|fer me to conclude without either compli|ment or &s;ignature.</Q></P>
<P>By this letter it clearly appears, that the amiable &s;ong&s;tre&s;s, the child, and mademoi|&s;elle St. Cyr, &s;poken of in it, are the &s;ame per&s;on; and that madame de Tournon then acknowledged her to be her &s;i&s;ter's child, and even intended to a&s;&s;i&s;t in re&s;toring her to the rank to which &s;he had a right.</P>
<P>Mademoi&s;elle de Choi&s;eul having now col|lected, by her lawyers, a body of evidence which appeared very &s;trong, was advi&s;ed to proceed again&s;t the duke de la Valli&eacute;re, the chevalier, and madame de Tournon, together; otherwi&s;e &s;he might, after having &s;ucceeded again&s;t one, be liable to the &s;ame difficulties with the other two. They were &s;ummoned to appear, and to be examined. The duke was fir&s;t que&s;tioned; his an&s;wers were eva&s;ive, and it &s;eemed that he &s;uffered a &s;truggle between the truth he kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w, and the fal&s;ehood it was his intere&s;t to maintain. The counte&s;s de Tournon ab&s;olutely denied every thing; but when the letter above recited was read to her, &s;he appeared hurt and confu&s;ed; yet per&s;i&s;ted
<PB N="321" REF="036316_0321_1008DB70A940AF28">
in affirming, that the letter did not relate to mademoi&s;elle St. Cyr.</P>
<P>The chevalier de la Valli&eacute;re, on the con|trary, hone&s;tly told all he knew; and from his account, mademoi&s;elle de Choi&s;eul gained an advantage, that all the efforts of the duke could not counteract.</P>
<P>Thus provided, this young per&s;on, hitherto appearing as a private gentlewoman, depend|ing on the bounty of madame d'Hautefort, prepared to bring that &s;uit to an i&s;&s;ue, which was to ri&s;e her to an exalted rank, and to re|&s;tore to her the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of one of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious hou&s;es in France.</P>
<P>But before &s;he had proceeded far, an unex|pected di&s;covery threw new light on the ob|&s;curity of her birth; &s;he was told that one Le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">c had in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion a regi&s;ter, which had for a great length of time been kept by his father (who had been dead ten years); and that as he (the elder) had attended the duche&s;s of Choi&s;eul, it was probable that whatever re|lated to the birth of her younge&s;t daughter would be found entered in this book.</P>
<P>Her lawyers therefore &s;ummoned Leduc, who the next morning appeared before Jour|dain, a notary employed in the affair: he produced the book, in which his father had carefully minuted the times of his various at|tendance, the money he received, and every other circum&s;tance that occurred in his prac|tice. There was found a detail of his fir&s;t
<PB N="322" REF="036316_0322_1008DB7340A2E338">
vi&s;it to madame de Choi&s;eul, of his having afterwards bled her; and at length, that on the 7th of October, 1697, he was &s;ent for to her at &s;ix o'clock in the evening, when he found her in labour, and who, between the hours of two and three the next morning, was delivered of a fine girl; which infant was entru&s;ted to him to be put out to nur&s;e; and which, on the 11th of October following, he carried to Meudon, having fir&s;t made a &s;light ra&s;ure of the &s;kin under the right ham, and again a little lower on the leg, which he rubbed with gunpowder: a method which makes a mark that never can be effaced.&mdash;The&s;e marks, mademoi&s;elle de Choi&s;eul bore.&mdash;Leduc then mentioned in his book, <Q>that he had carried the infant to St. Etienne du Mont to be bapti&s;ed, where &s;he had re|ceived the name of Julia;</Q> but without &s;peaking of her parents, godfather or godmo|ther. His journal al&s;o contained an account of money received and expended; among other articles, that he paid four livers ten &s;ons for the coach that carried him with the child to Meudon;&mdash;that he received various &s;ums, at times, for the maintenance of the child; and, among others, was a memorandum, that he was paid thirty new louis for his attendance, by the <HI>mar&s;hale&s;s</HI> de Choi&s;eul; a name which occa&s;ioned the adver&s;e party to a&s;&s;ert, that the whole tran&s;action did not allude to the du|che&s;s de Choi&s;eul, but to &s;ome other woman of
<PB N="323" REF="036316_0323_1008DB75DBA5F8F0">
fa&s;hion bearing the name of de Choi&s;eul. (There were then five or &s;ix marchione&s;&s;es and counte&s;&s;es de Choi&s;eul in France.)</P>
<P>The mar&s;hale&s;s de Choi&s;eul it certainly could not mean, as &s;he was eighty years old; and it is improbable, as &s;he was not on good terms with the duche&s;s, that &s;he &s;hould have undertaken, through friend&s;hip, to &s;ettle with Leduc on her account.</P>
<P>All the articles however of Leduc's regi&s;ter, which related to the conte&s;ted point, were extracted, and in&s;erted in the in&s;truments preparing by the lawyers on behalf of made|moi&s;elle de Choi&s;eul; who al&s;o de&s;ired to have this book depo&s;ited in &s;afe hands, that re|cour&s;e might be had to the original when re|qui&s;ite. To this Leduc, the &s;on, con&s;ented. But, as there were memorandums in it rela|tive to an infinite number of per&s;ons, he re|quired to have the liberty to &s;eal up him&s;elf every leaf in which there was nothing that related to mademoi&s;elle de Choi&s;eul. This was proper and rea&s;onable; and in that form the book remained to be in&s;pected by the court.</P>
<P>The duke de la Valli&eacute;re u&s;ed every effort to prevent the journal of Leduc being received as evidence. When he found that he could not accompli&s;h it by other means of oppo&s;ition, he in&s;i&s;ted upon having the whole book in|&s;pected; po&s;&s;ibly &s;uppo&s;ing, that the contents of &s;uch a journal being publicly known, might
<PB N="324" REF="036316_0324_1008DB78AA817070">
be attended with &s;uch inconvenience, and oc|ca&s;ion &s;o much confu&s;ion, that the court it|&s;elf would interfere to &s;tifle the whole. In this al&s;o he failed. The &s;ix judges who were to decide upon the cau&s;e, took the book them|&s;elves, and having examined it, found only fourteen articles which related to the cau&s;e in que&s;tion; one of their number took a copy of tho&s;e articles, and the book was carefully locked up.</P>
<P>The duke then made another effort to &s;up|pre&s;s the evidence of the book entirely, but his attempt again failed. He was now therefore obliged to &s;ubmit to have the cau&s;e tried in the very court, again&s;t the deci&s;ions of which he had, in the cour&s;e of the controver&s;y, twice appealed. The lawyers employed by made|moi&s;elle de Choi&s;eul failed not to urge, with great ability, all the facts herein &s;tated, to &s;ub&s;tantiate the claim of their client.</P>
<P>From the an&s;wers given by the duke de la Valli&eacute;re him&s;elf, the celebrated Le Normand, coun&s;el for the plaintiff, drew an inference favourable to her cau&s;e. The duke never de|clared that he did <HI>not</HI> believe mademoi&s;elle de Choi&s;eul was born of his &s;i&s;ter; but only, that he did not know or believe that &s;he was the daughter of the <HI>duke</HI> and duche&s;s of Choi&s;eul; by which he tacitly allowed &s;he might be the off&s;pring of the duche&s;s; and while he could not deny the maternity, threw indirectly a reflection on the honour of his &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="036316_0325_1008DB7B4A3C77D8">
The letter written by madame de Tournon was a &s;trong pre&s;umptive evidence, notwith|&s;tanding all her attempts to explain away its meaning; but the evidence given by the che|valier de la Valli&eacute;re was yet more conclu&s;ive. He acknowledged, that he knew his &s;i&s;ter, the duche&s;s de, Choi&s;eul, had four children, a &s;on and three daughters;&mdash;that his mother, and all the family, were appri&s;ed of her pregnancy in 1697;&mdash;that he knew the daughter of which &s;he had been delivered was brought up by madame d'Hautefort, under the name of St. Cyr;&mdash; and that, when his &s;i&s;ter was dying, &s;he told him &s;he had recommended her younge&s;t daughter to the protection, not only of madame d'Hautefort, but to that of her brother, the duke de la Valli&eacute;re; and that they had both promi&s;ed to watch over her welfare. To the&s;e forcible evidences, was added the journal of Leduc; and the whole &s;eemed to form a body rather of po&s;itive facts than pre&s;umptive proof.</P>
<P>The duke de la Valli&eacute;re's defence con&s;i&s;ted chiefly in reprobating the whole conduct of the defenders of mademoi&s;elle de Choi&s;eul; par|ticularly their availing them&s;elves of the jour|nal of Leduc, in which circum&s;tances were mentioned, which threw an odium on the conduct of the duche&s;s de Choi&s;eul, had they been true; though it is ob&s;ervable, that the duke de la Vaill&eacute;re's frequent repetition of his a&s;&s;ertion, <HI>that he did not believe the plaintiff
<PB N="326" REF="036316_0326_1008DB7F4EA26620">
to be the daughter of the duke and duche&s;s</HI> of Choi&s;eul, threw the &s;ame kind of reflection on the memory of his &s;i&s;ter. &mdash;The fact certainly was, that the plaintiff was born eight months and &s;ome days after the arrival of the duke de Choi&s;eul from being an ho&s;tage at the court of the duke of Savoy; and for four years preceding that period he did not re&s;ide in the hou&s;e with the duche&s;s, though he &s;ometimes &s;aw her.</P>
<P>When he was at Paris, he re&s;ided at the temple, while the duche&s;s inhabited a hou&s;e in r&uuml;e Verneuil; circum&s;tances that, together with the my&s;terious manner in which the child was brought up, certainly had the ap|pearance of improper conduct in the duche&s;s. On this, however, the duke de la Valli&eacute;re laid no &s;tre&s;s, but to exclaim again&s;t the con|duct of mademoi&s;elle de Choi&s;eul, who, in order to force her&s;elf into a family and pro|perty to which he prote&s;ted &s;he had no right, &s;crupled not to &s;tigmati&s;e as an adultre&s;s, a wo|man of the mo&s;t unimpeached and re&s;pectable character; and to di&s;turb, with an odious ca|lumny, the a&s;hes of her from whom &s;he pre|tended to derive her being.</P>
<P>But it was nece&s;&s;ary, that, in&s;tead of idle declamation, the duke de la Valli&eacute;re &s;hould bring proof that his &s;i&s;ter, the duche&s;s de Choi&s;eul, did not bring forth a child at the time this daughter was &s;uppo&s;ed to be born; or that, if &s;he did, this was not the per&s;on.
<PB N="327" REF="036316_0327_1008DB8249DB73E8">
Totally failing in tho&s;e proofs, an arret pa&s;&s;ed in the great chamber, by a majority of twenty-two voices again&s;t nine, permitting made|moi&s;elle de Choi&s;eul to prove to the court all the points her coun&s;el had alleged. The whole power and intere&s;t of the duke de La Valli&eacute;re and his friends were exerted to pre|vent this arret from being carried into exe|cution.</P>
<P>They tried to prevail on the king to anni|hilate the whole proceeding, by an act of arbitrary power; but the affair being laid be|fore the council of &s;tate, the arret was con|firmed.&mdash;In con&s;equence of all the proofs being examined, &s;entence was given, in June 1726, whereby Augu&s;tina-Frances de Choi&s;eul was fully e&s;tabli&s;hed and maintained in her claim; and was declared to be the daughter of Augu&s;tus de Choi&s;eul, duke and peer of France, and of his wife, Loui&s;a Gabriella de la Beaume le Blanc de la Valli&eacute;re; and all par|ties were forbidden, either by a renewal of the &s;uit, or in any way whatever to trouble her.</P>
<P>Mademoi&s;elle de Choi&s;eul, who&s;e health had always been extremely delicate, had &s;uf|fered &s;uch agitation of &s;pirits during this long and expen&s;ive conte&s;t, as greatly to impair it. When the &s;uit, at &s;ome period of its progre&s;s, took a turn which made her friends tremble for her &s;ucce&s;s, &s;he fainted, and was carried out of court totally in&s;en&s;ible. And to the anxiety of her mind it may be imputed, that
<PB N="328" REF="036316_0328_1008DB83D071C338">
&s;he enjoyed her good fortune only a very &s;hort time. She had hardly been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of her rank eighteen months, when &s;he fell into a decline, and died, as both her &s;i&s;ters had done, unmarried, and under thirty.</P>
<P>The influence of avarice appears very &s;trong in this hi&s;tory. The duke de la Valli&eacute;re undoubtedly knew that mademoi&s;elle de Choi|&s;eul was his niece; yet he could not deter|mine to acknowledge her, when a re&s;titution of her fortune was in que&s;tion the &s;ame cruel &s;elf-intere&s;t prevailed with madame de Tournon. It mu&s;t however be allowed, that the circum&s;tances of the birth, and my&s;terious manner in which the marchione&s;s d'Haut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rt, the friend of the duche&s;s de Choi&s;eul, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|cated her daughter, had a very unfavourable appearance; yet as &s;o little is known of the character of the duke her hu&s;band, and that little does, not place it in a very advantageous light, it was perhaps owing to his capricious or &s;u&s;picious temper, that they were con|&s;trained to adopt mea&s;ures injurious to the reputation of the duche&s;s, and fatal to the in|tere&s;t of her daughter.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e is related at great length by Guyot de Pitaval; but this abridgment is taken from the edition of Les Cau&s;es C&eacute;l&eacute;bres, by Richer, in which it occupies two hundred and twenty pages, containing many circum|&s;tances unnece&s;&s;ary or improper to be here related.</P>

<HEAD>RENEE CORBEAU.</HEAD>
<P>A YOUNG man, native of S&eacute;ez in Nor|mandy, of noble parents, &s;tudied the law at Angers. He there &s;aw Ren&eacute;e Cor|beau, the daughter of a trade&s;man of the town, and under a promi&s;e of marriage &s;e|duced her. Her &s;ituation was &s;oon &s;uch as made it nece&s;&s;ary to acquaint her parents with her engagement; who &s;ought for means to oblige her lover to perform tho&s;e promi&s;es which had induced Ren&eacute;e to li&s;ten to him.</P>
<P>Doubting that he would, if po&s;&s;ible, evade them, the parents thought it might be nece&s;&s;ary to employ artifice. They therefore pretended to take a journey; and, as &s;oon as they believed the lovers were together, returned &s;uddenly upon them, and, reproaching the young man with having &s;educed their daughter, in&s;i&s;ted on his in&s;tantly making the only reparation in his power, by &s;igning a contract of marriage, with which a notary was prepared, who was ready in the hou&s;e. The young man &s;igned the deed; but, feeling him&s;elf unworthily treated, in being thus &s;urprized into an en|gagement which he had never refu&s;ed to per|form,
<PB N="330" REF="036316_0330_1008DB87DF581BE0">
he went immediately to his father, to whom he related all that had happened. The father, yet more enraged than the &s;on, per|&s;uaded him to take prie&s;t's orders, as the only way to avoid completing a marriage &s;o di&s;|honourable and &s;o contrary to his intere&s;t; and this advice he ha&s;tily embraced. The unfortunate girl, thus abandoned by her faithle&s;s lover, commenced, together with her parents, a &s;uit again&s;t him for &s;eduction. He was in con&s;equence arre&s;ted, and the affair was brought before the parliament of Paris.</P>
<P>The &s;entence, after long pleading on both &s;ides, was, that the young man, &s;hould either marry Ren&eacute;e Corbeau, or be beheaded: as his being a prie&s;t made the former impo&s;&s;ible, he was to &s;uffer death.</P>
<P>He was delivered to the executioner; the fatal moment was at hand, and the prie&s;t at|tended to perform the la&s;t duties&mdash;when Ren&eacute;e Corbeau flew to the place where his judges were yet &s;itting, and, making her way through the crowd, be&s;ought permi&s;&s;ion to &s;peak; and a moment's &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the dreadful puni&s;hment about to be inflicted on her lover.</P>
<P>The judges, &s;truck with her beauty and di&s;tre&s;s, con&s;ented to hear her and with the &s;imple and affecting eloquence of nature &s;he plead <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> for his life. She repre&s;ent that they undoubtedly thought her more unhappy than
<PB N="331" REF="036316_0331_1008DB8CEF606718">
guilty, &s;ince they puni&s;hed with death him who was &s;uppo&s;ed to have betrayed her; but that &s;uch a &s;entence, far from repair|ing her misfortune, would render it irre|parable, by taking from her the only per|&s;on who could re&s;tore her honour; and, in|&s;tead of doing her ju&s;tice, would condemn her to tears and remor&s;e for the re&s;t of her life; and would leave her to endle&s;s regret, when &s;he reflected, that her fatal love had been the occa&s;ion of his death, for whom only &s;he wi&s;hed to live.</P>
<P>She be&s;ought tho&s;e among her judges, who had ever been &s;en&s;ible of the force of love, to put them&s;elves for a moment in her &s;ituation, and to reflect what they would them&s;elves &s;uffer, were they to be deprived of the object of their affection, by a cruel death, and to know them&s;elves the occa&s;ion of it;&mdash;<Q>for it is</Q> &s;aid &s;he, <Q>I who have armed the iron hand of law again&s;t him&mdash;'tis I who am his executioner&mdash;and 'tis I who, infinitely more unhappy then he is, am condemned to exi&s;t under infamy, and to carry with me to the grave the dreadful reflection of having murdered him by the exce&s;s of my attachment.</Q></P>
<P>Though the holy orders, into which he had entered, prevented his marrying her, &s;he re|pre&s;ented that they had been compul&s;ive, and made only through fear of a violent and im|perious father: but that a di&s;pen&s;ation might
<PB N="332" REF="036316_0332_1008DB8E73E06540">
be obtained to di&s;&s;olve them. She therefore implored the judges to &s;u&s;pend the execution of the &s;entence for a time, that her lover might take mea&s;ures to annul his religious vows, and become her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>The court, affected by her tears and de&s;pair, were induced to grant a re&s;pite, for &s;ix months; and, as a legate from the pope was then expected in France, &s;he flattered her&s;elf &s;he &s;hould obtain from him, permi&s;&s;ion for her lover to renounce the eccle&s;ia&s;tical habit and marry her.</P>
<P>But the cardinal de Medicis, who was the legate that &s;oon after arrived, was &s;o irritated again&s;t the young man, for having &s;acrilegi|ou&s;ly embraced holy orders, only to evade an engagement which his honour and his con|&s;cience, as well as every human law, urged him to fulfil, that he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to grant the di&s;pen&s;ation; and the unhappy Ren&eacute;e Corbeau was again driven to de&s;pair.&mdash;Henry the fourth, that excellent monarch, was then on the throne; his ears were ever open to the complaints of his &s;ubjects, and when youth and beauty pleaded, there was little doubt of redre&s;s from his compa&s;&s;ion, though his ju&s;tice was &s;ilent. Ren&eacute;e Corbeau threw her&s;elf at the king's feet, and the king, intere&s;ted by her figure and &s;ituation, very &s;oon &s;uffered him&s;elf to be prevailed upon. He ordered that a di&s;pen&s;ation might be granted; it was immediately expedited, and
<PB N="333" REF="036316_0333_1008DB912CA08B98">
the lover thus &s;natched from impending de&s;|truction, was married to his mi&s;tre&s;s. They lived together many years in the mo&s;t perfect union: the hu&s;band always remembering, with the tendere&s;t gratitude, that he owed his life, and the honour of his family, to the af|fection and attachment of his wife.</P>
