<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IF our government has pur&s;ued the cour&s;e dictated by the &s;pirit of our revolution; if good government requires the &s;ubjugation of one half of the community; if repub|licans have de&s;erved the la&s;hes and contempt which have been mo&s;t liberally dealt to them in this State for eleven years; or if the &s;pirit of per&s;ecution has &s;ub&s;ided:&mdash; Then the writer of the&s;e pages has been extremely unfortunate in the choice of his &s;ubject.</P>
<P>But Intolerance, with its hydra heads, &s;till roams about the State and no mercy is &s;hewn to tho&s;e who doubt the wi&s;dom of the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration. The efforts of an individual are &s;eeble when oppo&s;ed to the phalanx which &s;tand prepared to cru&s;h, in its infancy, freedom of enquiry and di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. If the&s;e &s;entiments, claim|ing no high parentage, &s;hould &s;ail of gaining the patronage of <HI>numbers</HI> in the State, they will be unable to endure even through the &s;hort period which generally bounds the exi&s;tence of &s;uch ephemeral productions.</P>
<P>The&s;e pages pre&s;ent the corner-&s;tones of an AMERICAN PALACE and the dark vaul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> where are to be entombed, in eternal &s;leep, the liberties and hope<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of this and fu|ture generations.

<P>Are &s;uch &s;ugge&s;tions to be lightly regarded when it is now known that a number of men, who have been our political leaders, were holding their meetings in the year 1787 to contrive ways and means for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of what they termed, <HI>A Con|federated Monarchy?</HI> When we read the &s;peech of General Hamilton in the Federal Convention, and now find him at the head of our army? When we hear our leading men avow that this country can never be governed without an <HI>Hereditary Monarch?</HI> When we &s;ee the appropriate plans of <HI>Monarchy</HI> adopted by admini&s;tration? When we read the federal papers filled with reflections on liberty and republicani&s;m and with prai&s;es of <HI>Monarchical</HI> government? When Fenno, the mouth-piece of the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">de|ral party has ju&s;t publi&s;hed a &s;cheme of a <HI>Federated, Pre&s;idential&punc; Monarchical Ari&s;to|cracy?</HI></P>
<P>In the following pages I have endeavored to repre&s;ent <HI>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uly</HI> the tendency of the leading mea&s;ures of our government, and even if one half of my po&s;itions and conclu|&s;ions be ju&s;t, <HI>a Monarchy is decidedly before us.</HI> The men now in place have been the contrivers or advocates of the&s;e <HI>mea&s;ures.</HI> If the people approve the <HI>means</HI> and the <HI>end,</HI> they will doubtle&s;s continue the <HI>in&s;truments</HI> in operation: otherwi&s;e a new election will open to republicans a new and mo&s;t de&s;irable pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>Our &s;outhern brethren wonder that Connecticut, once the garden of liberty, &s;hould now appear to be the hot-bed of ari&s;tocracy&mdash;that Connecticut, internally the mo&s;t democratic State in the union or in the world&mdash;a State where the opinions of the peo|ple have governed for more than a century; where government is le&s;s expen&s;ive and en|getic than in any other State; and were di&s;tinction of rank is hardly known, &s;hould be at|tached to expen&s;ive, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ergetic and ari&s;tocratic mea&s;ures, tending to humble the people land to create odious di&s;tinctions: But the <HI>people</HI> of Connecticut have not de&s;erved to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;e the confidence of republicans: They are radically attached to the principles of

<P>If athei&s;m and modern philo&s;ophy prevailed in the State, there might be &s;ome fear of the final prevalence of ari&s;tocracy; but <HI>there is not an athe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> in the &s;tate nor a &s;ingle modern philo&s;opher among the republican party;</HI> Dei&s;m is not prevalent, yet there are dei&s;ts in both parties, who&s;e infidelity has originated from cau&s;es wholly unconnected with politics. It has been &s;u&s;pected that &s;ome of the leading clergy wi&s;h to combine Church and State; but the body of the clergy, though they have preached Robi&s;on and circulated Barruel rather freely, have good intentions, and as fa&s;t as they &s;hall di&s;cover <HI>the tendency of our mea&s;ures to be again&s;t religion,</HI> they will become good repub|licans. In the &s;tate are &s;ome hypocrites, who carry their religion to marke and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> willing to pay for it in public offices and honors; yet the number of the&s;e is &s;mall and will probably decrea&s;e.</P>
<P>For eleven years freedom of the pre&s;s and of opinion have been re&s;trained; federal mea&s;ures have been pre&s;ented to the people <HI>highly coloured and embelli&s;hed with cuts;</HI>&mdash; an habitual confidence in the &s;tate-repre&s;entation has been extended to the federal re|pre&s;entation; after the exertions of the revolutionary war, the people habitually indu&s;trions, retired to their farms and occupations, and the calm, which naturally &s;ucceeds the turbulence of war, &s;uperindured by federal opiates, has hitherto pre|&s;erved them in a &s;tate of peaceful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the con&s;tituted authorities.</P>
<P>But a &s;ea&s;on has now arrived when "a little more &s;leep, a little more &s;lumber, a little more &s;olding of the hands to &s;leep," and they a&s;&s;uredly wake to a &s;tate of <HI>politi|cal ruin,</HI> more dreadful to freemen than the ruins of empires.

<HEAD>POLITICAL DELUSION.</HEAD>
<P>ON the eve of a day &s;et apart for a literary fea&s;t of fat things, I have adjudged that a plain di&s;h would be mo&s;t ac|ceptable. Indeed, had it been a&s;&s;igned to me to &s;peak to you of Greece and Rome; of the inexhau&s;tible trea&s;ures of Hebrew, Greek and Arabic, or to have di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the height and diameter of the antediluvians, or to have explained the cau&s;e why a black man is not a white man, or why an elm tree does not bear apricots: you mu&s;t have &s;at here in &s;ilence, and the &s;pirit would never have moved me to addre&s;s you. Avoiding literary di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, I have &s;elected as the theme of this occa&s;ion, THE EXTENT AND POWER OF POLITICAL DELUSION.</P>
<P>The <HI>character</HI> of delu&s;ion is mo&s;t &s;trongly marked at its fir&s;t appearance in our world, when Satan (<HI>cidevant</HI> that old &s;erpent, now called "the arch jacobin"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Lee's Sermon, preached at Colebrook, July 4,1800.</NOTE>) practi&s;ed his deceit on our federal mother, &s;aying to her, "For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then &s;hall your eyes be opened and ye &s;hall be as gods knowing good and evil." In the work of deceit, Satan has in all ages been uniform; he begins by quoting the knowledge of God in proof of that which is fal&s;e; he wi&s;hes to per&s;uade men to do that which they ought to avoid; he promi&s;es them good, and they &s;uffer evil; tho&s;e, who follow his advice, find the earth cur&s;ed for their &s;akes; thorns and thi&s;tles &s;pring up in place of fruits and flowers; by the &s;weat of their faces they eat their bread, till they return to the ground: and as for Satan, &s;ooner or later he ap|pears to tho&s;e, whom he has deceived, literally cur&s;ed
<PB N="6" REF="036980_0005_100B7420A8EA26D0">above all cattle. I &s;hall now leave Satan to that cla&s;s of men, who&s;e profe&s;&s;ional bu&s;ine&s;s is to detect his delu&s;ions, with this remark, that I doubt much whether they have rightly under&s;tood his <HI>political</HI> character.</P>
<P>The <HI>agents</HI> of delu&s;ion are, the great, the wi&s;e, rich and mighty men of the world. The&s;e, acting with powers of &s;ub&s;titution, are very &s;agacious in choo&s;ing, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">cce&s;s|ful in &s;ecuring, fit in&s;truments for their purpo&s;es. Delu|&s;ion prepares his prime agents with charming out&s;ides, en|gaging manners, powerful addre&s;s, and inexhau&s;tible ar|gument. He furni&s;hes them with an accurate knowledge of the heart, and opens all the avenues to the pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>The <HI>means</HI> of delu&s;ion are, uniformly the walking in a vain &s;how, hypocri&s;y a&s;&s;uming the garb of religion, pride of meekne&s;s, knavery of hone&s;ty, ambition of patrioti&s;m. As a full a&s;&s;umption of character is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ucce&s;s, and as delu&s;ion naturally over-acts, you find the greate&s;t impo&s;tors in our world to have appeared more holy, meek, hone&s;t and patriotic than other men.</P>
<P>The <HI>object</HI> of delu&s;ion is, to gain the wealth, honors and favors of men by cheap, fal&s;e and in&s;idious means.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;ubjects</HI> of delu&s;ion are, the laboring and &s;ubordinate people throughout the world. Their toil goes to &s;upport the &s;plendor, luxury and vices of the deluders, or their blood flows to &s;atiate lawle&s;s ambition. Nearly the whole of Africa, and a con&s;iderable part of A&s;ia, are &s;ubject to the delu&s;ions of Europe: &s;laves in immen&s;e troops mu&s;t &s;weat under a &s;corching &s;un to bear or follow the palan|quin of a lordly ma&s;ter: &s;laves by &s;hip-loads mu&s;t be dragged from their homes to &s;erve imperious tyrants: immen&s;e multitudes mu&s;t be bowing to &s;tocks and &s;tones, or kneeling before images and lighted tapers, to gratify the zeal of impo&s;tors.</P>
<P>The <HI>end</HI> of delu&s;ion is, the elevation of the deluders to a condition of power, &s;plendor and infallibility, and the reduction of the deluded from knowledge to ignorance, from freedom to &s;lavery, from wealth to want, from pre|&s;ent enjoyment to a de&s;titution of all things, and from fu|ture hopes to cea&s;ele&s;s doubt.</P>
<P>Having defined my &s;ubject, I &s;hall exclude from di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion all ancient delu&s;ions, from a per&s;ua&s;ion that to us
<PB N="7" REF="036980_0006_100B74232F208788">the pre&s;ent moment, the pre&s;ent character of man, the pre&s;ent form and pre&s;&s;ure of the times are infinitely more intere&s;ting than all the pa&s;t.</P>
<P>I might here entertain you with &s;ome of the light &s;kir|mi&s;hes of delu&s;ion in the ordinary walks of life; but have preferred to lead you at once into the political field, where he brings into general action all his forces, and di&s;plays all his character.</P>
<P>Having no lei&s;ure to make long porches, or to take by hou&s;e-row the mea&s;ures of our government, I &s;hall lead you at once into the <HI>commercial &s;y&s;tem</HI>&mdash;which, like a com|mon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">all, gives you acce&s;s to all the rooms of the federal building.</P>
<P>When republicans<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The terms "republican and democrat," are u&s;ed &s;ynonomou&s;ly throughout: becau&s;e the men who maintain the principles of 1776, are characteri&s;ed by one or the other of the&s;e names in different parts of the country.</NOTE> complain of a Navy, of diplomatic corps, of Algerine tribute, or Briti&s;h treaty, the uniform reply of the agents of delu&s;ion is, "all the&s;e things are ne|ce&s;&s;ary to commerce, and commerce is the hand maid of indu&s;try; abridge our political arrangements, &s;ay they, and all your well-earned produce would peri&s;h; your &s;hip-timber and &s;hips would be of no value; your &s;eamen would become towns-poor; your rope walks go to decay, and your merchants become bankrupt!"</P>
<P>Now every well informed merchant knows that there is not one word of truth in all this; yet, as Delu&s;ion has forged the &s;tory for his benefit, he is di&s;po&s;ed not to di&s;|credit it, and when &s;uch a plau&s;ible kind of things get a currency, they will pa&s;s like a well counterfeited bill, till by accident the deceit is di&s;covered, by which time the counterfeiter has gained all his ends. Every reflecting man knows that if the mo&s;t worthle&s;s produce in the world will attract our ve&s;&s;els to the mo&s;t di&s;tant ports, laden with the &s;taples of this country, then the&s;e &s;taples would, from their intrin&s;ic and unfailing value, together with the profits of the carrying trade, invite the merchants of tho&s;e ports to come and purcha&s;e of us. At our own doors we can make better bargains than abroad; we lo&s;e nothing by dangers of &s;ea, wa&s;tage, ca&s;ualties or bankruptcy; we receive every thing at full weight and gauge, and our ar|ticles
<PB N="8" REF="036980_0007_100B7426B20EF8D0">are put off in the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible order without any diminution.</P>
<P>Now, if with free ports and commerce thus conducted, our merchants could not live, then they live now merely by virtue of certain advantages tendered to them by the government, every one of which takes a million of dollars out of your pockets in order to enable you to gain half a million in another way. If the carrying trade is valua|ble, and we retaining this trade by political arrangements &s;ecure it to our merchants, and yet Spain, Holland and Great-Britain are willing to exchange their manufactures in their own ports for our produce, then &s;urely our pro|duce would be in high demand, and an object of &s;upreme competition, if government would &s;uffer the carrying trade to operate as a premium in favor of our market.</P>
<P>The fundamental propo&s;ition, viz. that &s;eparate from the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem, our articles would not be in market is pointedly denied, and if this is fal&s;e, the whole &s;uper|&s;tructure falls.</P>
<P>The real object is diametrically oppo&s;ite to the o&s;ten&s;i|ble one. The agricultural intere&s;t, in&s;tead of being help|ed is vitally attacked. This charming commercial &s;y&s;tem, &s;o &s;edulou&s;ly and artfully addre&s;&s;ed to the yeomanry of our country, is a &s;y&s;tem of indebtedne&s;s and eventual bankruptcy. Confining the carrying trade to our&s;elves, opens an infinite field of credit to the merchant. Millions of property, belonging to the farmers, mu&s;t con&s;tantly be in the hands of the merchants; for if the avails of our pro|cedure are to come from all quarters of the globe, there mu&s;t be an average credit given by the farmers till the re|turns can be made. This draws on to the water an im|men&s;e quantity of property, and intere&s;ts the farmers &s;trongly in the &s;ucce&s;s of the merchants whom they have tru&s;ted. This property on the water is within fi&s;cal pur|view and controul. Government has purpo&s;es to an&s;wer. The merchant is indirectly the collector of a great portion of the revenue. The merchant can lend &s;hips and cargoes to government. The merchant can plan long, circuitous and hazardous voyages, apparently at his own ri&s;que; but really at the ri&s;que of the farmer; for all lo&s;&s;es mu&s;t eventfully fall on tho&s;e who tru&s;t. The&s;e arrangement
<PB N="9" REF="036980_0008_100B74290B56EC70">leading great capitals in trade, great bankruptcies and great fortunes. They fill the &s;ea with ve&s;&s;els and &s;ailors, valuable auxiliaries and reverberators to a naval &s;y&s;tem. This la&s;t being calculated to protect the merchants, &s;e|cures their perpetual attachment, and they freely advocate the extraordinary expen&s;es of an armament. Their influ|ence is thrown directly in the &s;cale oppo&s;ed to the farmer, and government has thereby &s;ecured a number of capitali&s;ts to whom re&s;ort may be had in the day when grinding runs low at the trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>Before the adoption of this &s;y&s;tem, &s;ilver and gold mov|ed according to the laws of indu&s;try; but now banks are introduced, giving to paper a forced and unnatural circu|lation, taking the command of the medium of all bu&s;ine&s;s from the agricultural intere&s;t,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Money ought to repre&s;ent indu&s;try: the farmer's dollars earned by labor do repre&s;ent it: bank bills do not. It is hard on the farmer, that the man who earns nothing through the year, &s;hould be able with an indor&s;ed note to rai&s;e in an hour, double the annual avails of his farm, and to glut the market with money at the very moment when the farmer is ready to bring his dollars to market. Directors of banks can make money &s;carce or plenty as they plea&s;e: but though banks are ruinous to the farmers, they are nece&s;&s;ary to a forced commerce.</NOTE> and yielding it wholly to the commercial.</P>
<P>It is no wonder that in the complexity of this policy, the farmer is lo&s;t in the mid&s;t of paper bills, boundle&s;s credit, crouded harbours, princely e&s;tates, and made to cry out? O! the depth of the wi&s;dom of admini&s;tration! little dreaming that he has in fact paid and is paying an|nually the whole profits of the carrying trade, the whole of the Algerine tribute, the expence of all commercial treaties&mdash;of all the con&s;uls abroad&mdash;the amount of all the lo&s;&s;es by &s;ea&mdash;of all bad markets, and of all navy ex|pences &mdash;that the money, which he pays &s;uffers many &s;weatings before it gets to the trea&s;ury, and that what he does not pay is placed on intere&s;t, and that the land from which he rai&s;es this produce, which excites &s;uch a fatherly care of government, is pledged for the payment of princi|pal and intere&s;t, and that his children may always &s;ee the date and amount of the mortgage by calling on the &s;ur|veyors of the revenue. Little &s;hort of miracle can redeem men from &s;uch ma&s;terly &s;trokes of delu&s;ion.</P>
<P>This mercantile &s;y&s;tem leads up an appearance of im|men&s;e
<PB N="10" REF="036980_0009_100B742A8D0C2620">pro&s;perity, the reality of which is craftily a&s;cribed to government; but individuals appear to the world mo&s;t thrifty, when they are thriftily expending the price of their mortgaged e&s;tates: nations appear mo&s;t bu&s;y and thriving in &s;ea&s;ons of the greate&s;t expence and public di&s;|&s;ipation: for &s;uch occa&s;ions draw all the money into view and give it a rapid circulation. When a dollar changed owners once in a week it counted only for a dollar; but when by the magic power of a forced commerce it changes owners an hundred times in a week it counts for an hun|dred dollars. If all the property of a town like this were to be tran&s;ported every day through all the &s;treets, there would be great commotion and a great &s;how of bu&s;ine&s;s and wealth, and the gaping world might admire the thrift of the place, and might lend money on the credit of it. Ju&s;t like &s;uch a farce is that of the great public pro&s;perity now enjoyed. The people are not more indu&s;trious than they were before the revolution: they are certainly more extravagant, mortages abound more on the records&mdash;in|cluding public and private indebtedne&s;s, there never was a &s;ea&s;on before this when the people were &s;o deeply in|volved. Burn all your paper-bills, and your paper evi|dences of debt, public and private, worlds full of which would not add one cent to the real worth of any country, or collect the debts evidenced by the&s;e papers, and which now lie as a heavy weight on the hou&s;es, lands and indu&s;|try of the people, and this delu&s;ive vi&s;ion of pro&s;perity would vani&s;h: but this delu&s;ion an&s;wers the political pur|po&s;es of un&s;ettling the public mind, of de&s;troying frigid ideas of oeconomy and of making tolerable many public projections, which otherwi&s;e would be dete&s;ted.</P>
<P>This commercial &s;y&s;tem pre&s;ents to the world an im|men&s;e tonnage, which not only fortifies the appearance of pro&s;perity; but affords employment to a numerous cla&s;s of men on land, who mu&s;t feel grateful for a &s;y&s;tem which yields them wealth; and it employs a number of ma&s;ters and mates, who mu&s;t ki&s;s the hand which feeds them; and &s;ailors, who are mo&s;t valuable a&s;tringents in the ingredient of power, and may an&s;wer for lining to wooden walls; and delu&s;ion whi&s;pers that by the&s;e things all the money is &s;aved among our&s;elves. Though this is
<PB N="11" REF="036980_0010_100B742CE93024C8">among Delu&s;ion's weak tricks, yet it is too often &s;ucce&s;sful. It has been well &s;aid that it will co&s;t two ducats to keep one in pri&s;on. To the man who is able to pay for mo|ney, it matters not whether that which is to fill his coffers be now in his own town, or in Madrid or Canton: his indu&s;try will draw it from the ends of the earth. If we lived on an i&s;thmus or an i&s;land, the &s;ugge&s;tion of &s;aving the money might be more plau&s;ible; but living in a coun|try of immen&s;e extent, capable of employing more than ten times its number of inhabitants, capable of infinite in|ternal defence, and of keeping tributary to us all nations &s;o long as natural or artificial wants &s;hall be known in the world, it is an idle &s;ugge&s;tion&mdash;and the time will come, when it will be hard to make the readers of hi&s;tory believe that Americans in the infancy of &s;ociety, of &s;ettlement and agriculture, did &s;eriou&s;ly undertake to fight their way through nations, whom they could not buy nor bribe, to carry the nece&s;&s;aries of life to the men of tho&s;e nations who were peri&s;hing for the want of them, and then with a return-cargo of far le&s;s u&s;eful produce to fight their way home again&mdash;and that all this was done with the full and free con&s;ent of the men who rai&s;ed the exports, and who could have &s;old them without hazard for a better price at their own doors.</P>
<P>Commerce, aided by banks, draws property into the hands of men without the medium of indu&s;try. Such men not knowing the earning of money are adventurous and extravagant.

<P>The&s;e ari&s;tocracies &s;ink the people.

<P>All the&s;e ari&s;tocracies and mea&s;ures which I have no|ticed corre&s;pond exactly with the &s;y&s;tems of monarchical government. At the end of eleven years, the American nation (formerly called the United States) have with great

The tendency of all governments is towards monarchy: di&s;crimination of rank is among the fir&s;t objects. When the leaders have compa&s;&s;ed this, the body of the people &s;ink into a &s;tupid ma&s;s, to be thereafter ranked as in the fir&s;t cla&s;s of cattle to be driven to the military &s;laughter-hou&s;es, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to be &s;hip|ped abroad for foreign con&s;umption, or to be dragging about their hated lives at homes, &s;ubject to the la&s;h and command of imperious lords, rai&s;ed from nothing by the power of delu&s;ion practi&s;ed on them&s;elves.</P>

<P>Who are the men con&s;tantly prai&s;ing the mea&s;ures of government? Tho&s;e great, well-born! all intere&s;ted in the &s;ubject of their prai&s;es; all craft&s;men, who live by making images for the wor&s;hippers of the great godde&s;s, or tho&s;e really <HI>ba&s;e-born</HI> men, who have been in the habit of following the&s;e great men faithfully as hounds do the horn. The&s;e wi&s;e, pious leaders are crafty enough to &s;peak to their followers truly and rationally on common &s;ubjects, and by this they gain their confidence; like the retailer, who wi&s;hing to get cent. per cent. profit on arti|cles not well under&s;tood, will &s;ell his pins and needles for le&s;s than prime co&s;t. Multitudes of men, who&s;e rights are daily abridging, follow on in admiration of go|vernment. They are made to believe that religion is at|tacked, or that the French are coming upon us, or that the democrats are rai&s;ing an army, or that the rays of pre&s;idential favor, after melting down all the great men above them, may finally honor them with a &s;corching. A great temptation with the ba&s;e-born is, that by thus doing, they keep the track of the great, dignified and wealthy; exactly the company which de&s;pi&s;es them, and which they ought to avoid.

<P>The uniform language of the&s;e great men, is, "a little more patience, a little more money, in a &s;hort time <HI>&s;un|beams</HI> will be in abundance." yet never was &s;uch a pro|mi&s;e reali&s;ed. When delu&s;ion is detected, and di&s;ap|pointment &s;ucceeds, it &s;ometimes happens, that an heroic patriot dares to &s;ay as Tell<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hero of the revolution in Switzerland, anno 1300<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"></NOTE> to Gre&s;ler, "Tyrant, this arrow is for thy heart"&mdash;but it is &s;tupid to bear and &s;uffer voluntarily, or like Carthu&s;ians to beat our&s;elves, till ex|exce&s;&s;ive pain &s;timulates to vengeance on the &s;y&s;tem.

<P>Having pre&s;ented a cour&s;e of delu&s;ions under the head of the&s;e great men; you may be ready to a&s;k, if the&s;e men are dangerous, how &s;hall we get rid of them?

<P>'Tis a real mistortune to the nine-tenths of &s;ociety, that the other tenth &s;hould be oppo&s;ed to them; but never let it be forgotten, that the argument drawn from the coinci|dence of great and wi&s;e and holy politicians in public mea&s;ures, is of all others the mo&s;t alarming. The&s;e are the only men whom you have to fear. If &s;ome are apparently more holy than their neighbors, then if they meddle with your politics they are mo&s;t capable of deceiving you; their holine&s;s may recommend them to heaven; but is no guarantee for their political rectitude. This cla&s;s, how|ever, are generally &s;et on by other great men: not by tho&s;e who are great becau&s;e they are rich; for the&s;e are the tools of another &s;et who are the knowing ones. In Athens tho&s;e who became too great and influential &s;uffer|ed o&s;traci&s;m; but in this country we ought to have pru|dence enough to prevent any man or cla&s;s of men from de&s;erving &s;uch an honorable bani&s;hment.</P>
<P>For my own part I am willing to be governed by men greater, wi&s;er and richer than my&s;elf: but have no opin|ion of having men &s;o great that their altitude mu&s;t be ta|ken by a quadrant and their width by a four-rod chain. Through exce&s;&s;ive indulgence we have already a number of men too great for a republic. How arrives it that the&s;e great men are &s;o very fit to govern? Internal govern|ment is de&s;igned to control inordinate pa&s;&s;ions; great men are mo&s;t proud, avaricious and tyrannical? Will you then &s;elect the&s;e to curb pride, avarice and tyranny? Re|publican &s;ociety is to protect the weak again&s;t the &s;trong; but if the &s;trong are to have all the power, the weak will be oppre&s;&s;ed. But &s;ays one and another, what will be|come of our great men? My an&s;wer is, that they always had addre&s;s enough to work their own pa&s;&s;ages. The great ho&s;t of mankind the nine-tenths are tho&s;e, which a republican government ought to concern it&s;elf about, and if this is faithfully attended to, the other tenth will &s;till gain &s;uch a portion of power and money as will make them u&s;eful in&s;tead of dangerous.

The man, who told them this, knew it to be fal&s;e: he never &s;aw any man in his &s;en&s;es, who wi&s;hed to de&s;troy all reli|gion, and &s;urely he never believed that great exertions would be made by men to get into place, if their object was not other than to tear down the edifice of government and to bury them&s;elves in its ruins. Multitudes of ration|al men are for de&s;troying that kind of religion, which is made a foot-ball or &s;talking hor&s;e and which operates on|ly to di&s;honor God and ruin man; but the world at large are well di&s;po&s;ed to have due homage paid to the &s;ource of being, though they may differ about the forms, in which that can be mo&s;t acceptably rendered.</P>
<P>But let us try another traver&s;e. From the whole num|ber of reputed federali&s;ts deduct tho&s;e, who depend di|rectly or indirectly on government for &s;upport&mdash;deduct the expectants of federal office: <HI>the&s;e</HI> &s;urely are not impar|tial judge, then deduct the great ho&s;t of men who are marked like a box of gla&s;s, with a <HI>keep this &s;ide up,</HI> who would be plea&s;ed with any government under a dey, bey, monarch, grand duke, grand &s;eignior, or viceroy, provi|ded they could &s;hare the power of it: men who prai&s;e all preachers, &s;erve all great men, and are lacquies to every thing but truth and hone&s;ly&mdash;then deduct the great num|ber of men who are wholly uninformed on the &s;ubject of government and who are federal merely becau&s;e they are hauled about by a federal windla&s;s&mdash;then deduct the men in advanced life, who have &s;een many changes and have
<PB N="45" REF="036980_0044_100B747E99514320">been deluded in them all and who calculate that in any government things will be as bad as the men in power can make them.</P>

I have avoided to &s;peak to you of unaccounted for millions; but HAVE PRESENTED SYSTEMS BY WHICH THE WEALTH OF THE WORLD IS TO BE WASTED, AND THE BLOOD OF MILLIONS IS TO FLOW; yet it may be well for you to know that the &s;upport of your government now amounts to 42,000 dol|lars a day<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Appendix.</NOTE>&mdash;that this expence has been, and is encrea&s;ing, and that in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion it was found impo&s;&s;ible to pro|vide ways and means to rai&s;e the 15 millions of dollars for the expen&s;es of the pre&s;ent year. The &s;ecretary propo&s;ed a &s;tamp duty on transfers of real e&s;tate. The committee of ways and means propo&s;ed a national lottery, which might annually rai&s;e from 100 to 150 thou&s;and dollars, and the &s;ame committee reported the expediency of im|powering the pre&s;ident to borrow 3,500,000 dollars for the &s;ervice of the pre&s;ent year. Large loans are convenient &s;ops for a greedy &s;inking fund&mdash;when public re&s;ources fail, and public good requires &s;ome object to be compa&s;&s;ed too abandoned to ju&s;tify a tax or a &s;ub&s;cription&mdash;a Jottery is often propo&s;ed, and in the &s;cheme immen&s;e advantages are offered to the purcha&s;er: no le&s;s than one chance in 25,000 to draw the highe&s;t prize. And old &s;oldier would be &s;hot at for one cent, if his chance of being killed was no greater than one in 25,000; but wor&s;e than bad chances, the &s;inews of indu&s;try mu&s;t be cut in the purcha&s;er: relying on dame fortune he mu&s;t quit dame indu&s;try; for they keep their lodgers at different hotels. Scarcely two and a half blanks to a prize! and why &s;hould not fortune deluge a man for this once when before &s;he had never dropt on him a particle of her dew? But the fortunate adventurer mu&s;t re&s;ign 15 per cent. in order to entitle him to a draw-back of 15 per cent in his chance for ruin; and the woe-worn di&s;appointed blank-holders are taught to wait for another &s;cheme and better &s;tars.</P>
<P>All this bears in front the marks of delu&s;ion, and it is far better to be thus deluded than to have money rai&s;ed
<PB N="58" REF="036980_0057_100B749D7841FE28">upon us by indirect means. When my tax-ma&s;ter fears to pre&s;ent me his bill, le&s;t I &s;hould a&s;k the whys and wherefores, he contrives in &s;ome artful way to pick my pockets. He knows that I have pa&s;&s;ions, propen&s;ities and wants. The&s;e he taxes in the articles which contri|bute to my &s;upply or indulgence. He &s;ees that &s;treams of wealth are flowing into the Trea&s;ury through the medi|um of &s;ugar-hog&s;heads and tea-che&s;ts. I feel that my re|&s;ources are expending: he cheers me up with "fear not, the hairs of your head are all numbered," to which I might well reply, "yes, and all the pence in my pocket." But lotteries draw money from the credulous; indirect taxes from the voluptuary: imperious nece&s;&s;ity demands a &s;tamp and valuation tax: all will not ward off the dreaded cri|&s;is: though in an individual the lending of money at 8 per cent. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a crime. denominated by &s;tatute corrupt and u&s;urious and meriting a forfeiture of the whole &s;um loan|ed; yet the exigencies of government drive them to pro|cure the commi&s;&s;ion of this crime. Then comes the mo|ment for &s;overeign delu&s;ion to open all its batteries, the wounds of a bleeding country! ju&s;t healing under the metallic tractors of Grenville, opened afre&s;h by exter|minating France: a country, impoveri&s;hed by too copi|ous emanations of gratitude towards the revolutionary ar|my and overpowered by &s;en&s;ibility towards the Dey of Algiers, for &s;uffering us to exchange the mo&s;t valuable productions of the earth for the wine, oil and fruits of the Mediterranean; a mo&s;t benevolent country, wi&s;hing to be on &s;peaking and hand-&s;haking terms with every pow|er in Europe, and obliged for that end to &s;end abroad &s;hip loads of diplomacy; a mo&s;t equitable country, &s;uf|fering the irruptions of lawle&s;s &s;avages, and the plots of &s;editious jacobins&mdash;mu&s;t have an army; mu&s;t have a fleet. A warlike attitude commands peace, and a peace|ful conduct provokes wars; exertions mu&s;t be made: po&s;terity mu&s;t not be burdened with taxes. All this is clo&s;ed with a flattering &s;tatement of the financial condi|tion of our country and a few round periods &s;hewing the pro&s;perity of our country as flowing from the greate&s;s quantity of wi&s;dom, prudence and patrioti&s;m that was ev|er

<P>Mo&s;t of the delu&s;ions which I have named to you will be practi&s;ed on you at the approaching Pre&s;idential election, and then delu&s;ion ever bu&s;y and inventive, will a&s;&s;ume new and potent forms proportioned to the immen&s;e import|ance of that occa&s;ion. Some candidates will be propo&s;ed to you who&s;e whole &s;y&s;tem con&s;i&s;ts of the delu&s;ions which I have explained: but was our revolution archieved? did the great God guide the &s;torm in order to land as in the harbor of peace and freedom, and yet is the whole &s;cene to be clouded with the bur&s;ting of crakers and rai&s;|ing of &s;ky-rockets? Republicans be awake&mdash;the day is more important than any day of your revolution. Now republicani&s;m dies or lives forever. Your candidate is a tried patriot and &s;tate&s;man.

Federali&s;ts need not apprehend that &s;uch a man is to be held up; but your candidate is Jeffer&s;on, pre&s;ident of the philo&s;ophical &s;oci|ety, who in all his communications to them has &s;poken reverently of the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of God;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Appendix</NOTE> the man who in his writings has &s;poken reverently of chri&s;tian re|ligion, and has for years &s;upported at his own expence, a preacher of the go&s;pel; a man of unque&s;tionable morality both in theory and practice&mdash;amiable in private life&mdash;holding the &s;econd office in your government by the free &s;uffrages of the people&mdash;the ingenious di&s;coverer of a perfect &s;tandard of weights and mea&s;ures, and the man who in public as well as private has dared to &s;peak truths galling to federal ears&mdash;has dared to &s;ay that we had men who preferred the calm of de&s;poti&s;m to the tempe&s;tuous

Knowing accurately the power of delu&s;ion, he ventured to predict, that after the war there would be a relap&s;e of &s;pirit in the people; that abu&s;es would creep in and would continue till a cri|&s;is, when by the energy of the people our rights would re|vive or till they &s;hould expire in a convul&s;ion, and here|in he predicted this very day. Our &s;pirit has declined; gro&s;s abu&s;es have crept in; we have a powerful ari&s;tocrat|ic monarchic Britannic faction; but by a due exertion of your con&s;titutional right of election, your rights may yet revive, and the man who predicted this, lives to receive the te&s;timony of your re&s;pect and confidence, the with|holding of which may lead you to the &s;ad cata&s;trophe of &s;eeing your dearly earned rights literally expire in a con|vul&s;ion. However you may be agitated on the &s;ubject of religion, re&s;t a&s;&s;ured that you are not to depend on any admini&s;tration of government for the pro&s;perity of Zion. You will not, like the people of England, expect that ex|amples of piety, i&s;&s;ues of grace and &s;treams of &s;alvation are to flow from his mo&s;t &s;acred maje&s;ty and the titled &s;laves which compo&s;e a luxurious court. The chariot wheels of &s;alvation are far different from the chariot wheels which are to be rolling round the &s;treets of the federal city with loads of dome&s;tic and imported infidelity.</P>
<P>Finally, republicans, be &s;trong: though they, who are oppo&s;ed to you may &s;ay, "we are called legion; for we are many, fear not their numbers." Though they may offer you all the kingdoms of the world in con&s;ideration of your &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; though they may &s;ay, "follow us and ye &s;hall be as gods," heed them not; their bu&s;ine&s;s is to delude you. Singular as it may &s;eem, though you have been called infidels, yet you have to combat &s;y&s;tems de|&s;tructive to religion; though you have been called jaco|bins, yet you have to contend for that equal rational free|dom which no jacobin ever &s;ought. Though you have been called infernals, yet you have the &s;ame enemies to|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ight which the ancient church had: you have principal|ities and powers, and the rulers of the darkne&s;s of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and &s;piritual wickedne&s;s in high places with the

Tho' a government which you equally obtained and equally &s;upport, has been directed both in language and laws a|gain&s;t your feelings, liberties and rights; yet you have waited <HI>peaceably;</HI> though <HI>impatiently</HI> for the day of your con&s;titutional deliverance.

If you have firmne&s;s to meet the cri&s;is and faithfully to act your parts in it you may &s;hout, for your redemption is at the doors.</P>
<P>But if in any of you pre&s;ent, delu&s;ion has wrought its perfect work, if you have bowed the knee to the political Baal: if you are &s;lavi&s;hly devoted to the <HI>&s;elf-&s;tiled</HI> friends of order and good government, then bid an eternal adieu to the freedom, which you never merited; prepare your necks for the yoke, hail I&s;&s;achar as your venerated ance&s;|tor, &s;ay to delu&s;ion <HI>"thou art our father,"</HI> and to funding &s;y&s;tem, federal city, foreign intercour&s;e, army, navy, <HI>"ye are our brethren and &s;i&s;ters."</HI></P>

<P>(<HI>See reference in page</HI> 28.)</P>
<P>In Connecticut the&s;e officers are cho&s;en by the &s;tate at large, not by di&s;tricts. In both cla&s;&s;es nominations are fir&s;t made, and the men nominated are generally unknown to the freemen: So true is this that if the name of George Penro&s;e or Henry H. Childs were &s;et in the li&s;t, they would &s;tand a good chance of being within the fir&s;t 18 for Congre&s;s or the fir&s;t 20 for Council, though the&s;e men do not live in the &s;tate. But for the &s;ake of giving perma|nency to the&s;e offices, the names of tho&s;e who have been in office are generally at the head of the li&s;t, and have a far greater chance of gaining the nomination than tho&s;e near the foot of it. When the votes for coun&s;ellors are counted, if the &s;enior coun&s;ellor of the la&s;t year &s;hould be found to have the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> number within the fir&s;t 20, yet he will be returned to the freemen as <HI>fir&s;t</HI> in nomination: whereas he ought to be the <HI>la&s;t.</HI> Place him <HI>la&s;t</HI> and it would be next to a miracle if he &s;hould be appointed. Place him <HI>fir&s;t</HI> and he will &s;urely be re-elected. If the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives attempt to alter this they are always negatived by the council.&mdash;The council thus permanently fixed, are a&s;&s;ociated with the corporation of Yale college, which is generally compo&s;ed of intelligent mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel. This combination of Church and State furni&s;hes a column of influence which has been hitherto u&s;ed in favor of the men in place. The right of the people to choo&s;e electors has been taken from them. Their right to have the man returned as fir&s;t in nomination whom they placed fir&s;t has been taken from them; Multitudes of freemen have cea&s;ed to attend free|men's meetings, from a per&s;ua&s;ion that with their be&s;t ex|ertions, they will be unable to effect any thing; and it really is not important for them to re-a&s;&s;ert their rights of election, till they have re&s;olved to break the enchantments and bani&s;h the delu&s;ions which encompa&s;s them.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="extract">
<HEAD>FIRST IMPRESSION, PAGE 292.</HEAD>
<P>"The error &s;eems not &s;ufficiently eradicated, that the operations of the mind, as well as the acts of the body, are &s;ubject to the coercion of the laws. But our rulers can have authority over &s;uch natural rights only as we have &s;ubmitted to them. The rights of con&s;cience we never &s;ubmitted, we could not &s;ubmit. We are an&s;wer|able for them to our God. The legitimate powers of go|vernment extend to &s;uch acts only as are injurious to others. But it does me no injury for my neighbor to &s;ay there are twenty gods, or no god. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg. If it be &s;aid his te&s;timony in a court of ju&s;tice, cannot be relied on, reject it then, and be the &s;tigma on him. Con&s;traint may make him wor&s;e, by making him a hypocrite, but it will never make him a truer man. It may fix him ob&s;tinately in his errors, but will not cure them. Rea&s;on and free enquiry are the only effectual a|gents again&s;t error. Give a loo&s;e to them, they will &s;up|port the true religion by bringing every fal&s;e one to their tribunal, to the te&s;t of their inve&s;tigation. They are the natural enemies of error, and of error only. Had not the Roman government permitted free enquiry, <HI>chri&s;tianity</HI> could never have been introduced. Had not free enqui|ry been indulged, at the era of the reformation, the cor|ruptions of <HI>chri&s;tianity</HI> could not have been purged away. If it be re&s;trained now, the pre&s;ent corruptions will be protected and new ones encouraged. Was the govern|ment to pre&s;cribe to us our medicine and diet, our bodies would be in &s;uch keeping as our &s;ouls are now.&mdash;Thus in France the emetic was once forbidden as a medi|cine, and the potatoe as an article of food. Government is ju&s;t as infallible too when it fixes &s;y&s;tems in phy&s;ics.&mdash;
<PB N="69" REF="036980_0068_100B74B81E48F9B8">Galileo was &s;ent to the inqui&s;ition for affirming that the earth was a &s;phere: the government had declared it to be as flat as a trencher, and Galileo was obliged to abjure his error. This error, however, at length prevailed, the earth became a globe, and De&s;cartes declared it was whirled round its axis by a vortex. The government in which he lived was wi&s;e enough to &s;ee that this was no que&s;tion of civil juri&s;diction, or we &s;hould all have been involved by authority in vortices. In fact, the vortices have been ex|ploded, and the Newtonian principle of gravitation is now more firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed on the ba&s;is of rea&s;on, than it would be were the government to &s;tep in and made it an article of nece&s;&s;ary faith. Rea&s;on and experiment have been in|dulged, and error has fled before them. It is error alone which needs the &s;upport of government. Truth can &s;tand by it&s;elf. Subject opinion to coercion: whom will you make your inqui&s;itors? Fallible men: men governed by bad pa&s;&s;ions, by private as well as public rea&s;ons. And why &s;ubject it to coercion? To produce uniformity. But is uniformity of opinion de&s;irable? No more than of face and &s;tature. Introduce the bed of Procru&s;tes then, and as there is danger that the large men may beat the &s;mall, make us all of a &s;ize, by lopping the former and &s;tretching the latter. Difference of opinion is advantageous in reli|gion. The &s;everal &s;ects perform the office of a Cen&s;or morum over each other. Is uniformity attainable? Mil|lions of innocent men, women and children, &s;ince the in|troduction of chri&s;tianity, have been burnt, cortured, fined, impri&s;oned: yet we have not advanced one inch towards uniformity, What has been the effect of coercion? To make one half the world fools, and the other half hypo|crites. To &s;upport roguery and error all over the earth. Let us reflect that it is inhabited by a thou&s;and millions of people. That the&s;e profe&s;s, probably, a thou&s;and dif|ferent &s;y&s;tems of religion. That ours is but one of that thou&s;and. That if there be but one right, and ours that one, we &s;hould wi&s;h to &s;ee the 999 wandering, &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cts gathered into the fold of truth.

<PB N="70" REF="036980_0069_100B74BB50332FB0">wi&s;h others to indulge it when we refu&s;e it our&s;elves.&mdash;But every State, &s;ays an inqui&s;itor, has e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;ome religion. No two, &s;ay I, have e&s;tabli&s;hed the &s;ame. Is this a proof of the infallibility of e&s;tabli&s;hments? Our &s;i&s;ter States of Penn&s;ylvania and New-York, however, have long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted without any e&s;tabli&s;hment at all. The ex|periment was new and doubtful when they made it. It has an&s;wered beyond conception. They flouri&s;h infinite|ly. Religion is well &s;upported; of various kinds indeed, but all good enough; all &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve peace and order: or if a &s;ect ari&s;es who&s;e tenets would &s;ubvert mo|rals, good &s;en&s;e has fair play, and rea&s;ons and laughs it out of doors, without &s;uffering the State to be troubled with it. They do not hang more malefactors than we do. They are not more di&s;turbed with religious di&s;&s;entions. On the contrary, their harmony is unparalleled, and can be a&s;cribed to nothing but their unbounded tolerance, be|cau&s;e there is no other circum&s;tance in which they differ from every nation on earth. They have made the happy di&s;covery that the way to &s;ilence religious di&s;putes, is to take no notice of them. Let us too give this experiment fair play, and get rid, while we may, of tho&s;e tyrannical laws. It is true we are as yet &s;ecured again&s;t them by the &s;pirit of the times. I doubt whether the people of this country would &s;uffer an execution for here&s;y, or a three years impri&s;onment for not comprehending the my&s;teries of the trinity. But is the &s;pirit of the people an infallible, a permanent reliance? Is it government? Is this the kind of protection we receive in return for the rights we give up? Be&s;ides, the &s;pirit of the times may alter, will alter. Our rulers will become corrupt, our people carele&s;s. A &s;ingle zealot may commence per&s;ecutor, and better men be his victims. It can never be too often repeated, that the time for fixing every e&s;&s;ential right on a legal ba&s;is is while our rulers are hone&s;t, and our&s;elves united. From the conclu&s;ion of this war we &s;hall be going down hill. It will not then be nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;ort every moment to the people for &s;upport. They will be forgotten therefore, and their rights di&s;regarded. They will forget them&s;elves, but in the &s;ole faculty of making money, and will never think of uniting to effect a due re&s;pect for their rights.
