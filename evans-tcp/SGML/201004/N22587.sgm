<P>TO &s;uch as have read the Rev.

And while the reader is highly entertained in the peru&s;al of them, he will find they have a &s;trong tendency to rai&s;e in his mind the mo&s;t beneficial ideas.</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. IT was in pur&s;uance of an advice given by bi|&s;hop Taylor, in his <HI>Rules for Holy Living and Dying,</HI> that about fifteen years ago, I began to take a more exact account than I had done before, of the manner wherein I &s;pent my time, writing down how I had employed every hour. This I continued to do, wherever I was, till the time of my leaving England. The variety of &s;cenes which I then pa&s;&s;ed through, induced me to tran&s;cribe from time to time, the more material parts of my diary, adding here and there &s;uch little reflections as occurred to my mind. Of this Journal thus occa&s;ionally compiled, the following is a &s;hort extract: it not being my de&s;ign to relate all tho&s;e particulars which I wrote for my own u&s;e only, and which would an&s;wer no valuable end to others, however important they were to me.</P>
<P N="2">2. Indeed I had no de&s;ign or de&s;ire to trouble the world with any of my little affairs; as it cannot but appear to every impartial mind, from my having been &s;o long <HI>as one that heareth not,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the loud and frequent calls I have had to an&s;wer for my|&s;elf. Neither &s;hould I have done it now, had not Captain Williams's affidavit, publi&s;hed <HI>as &s;oon as he had left England,</HI> laid an obligation upon me, to do what in me lies, in obedience to that command of God, <HI>Let not the good which is in you be evil &s;poken of.</HI> With this view I do at length <HI>give an an&s;wer to every man that a&s;keth me a rea&s;on of the hop which is in me,</HI>
<PB N="vi" REF="029861_0005_0FE2A854B1A8F788">that in all the&s;e things, <HI>I have a con&s;cience void of of|fence towards God and towards man.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. I have prefixed hereto a letter wrote &s;everal years &s;ince, containing a plain account of the ri&s;e of that little &s;ociety in Oxford, which has been &s;o variou&s;ly repre&s;ented. Part of this was publi&s;hed in 1733; but without my con&s;ent or knowledge. It now &s;tands as it was wrote; without any addition, diminution, or amendment; it being my only concern herein, naked|ly to <HI>declare the thing as it is.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Perhaps my employments of another kind may not allow me to give any farther an&s;wer to them who <HI>&s;ay all manner of evil of me, fal&s;ely,</HI> and &s;eem to <HI>think that they do God &s;ervice.</HI> Suffice it, that both they and I &s;hall &s;hortly <HI>give an account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.</HI></P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Oxford, <DATE>Oct. 18, 1730.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE occa&s;ion of my giving you this trouble is of a very extraordinary nature. On Sunday la&s;t I was informed (as no doubt you will be e're long) that my brother and I had killed your &s;on: that the rigorous fa&s;ting which he had impo&s;ed upon him&s;elf, by our advice, had increa&s;ed his iline&s;s and ha&s;tened his death. Now though, con&s;idering it in it&s;elf, <HI>it is a very &s;mall thing with me to be judged with man's judgment;</HI> yet as the being thought guilty of &s;o mi&s;chievous an imprudence might make me the le&s;s able to do the work I came into the world for, I am obliged to clear my&s;elf of it, by ob&s;erving to you, as I have done to others, that your &s;on left off fa&s;ting about a year and a half &s;ince, and that it is not yet half a year &s;ince I began to practi&s;e it.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not let this opportunity &s;lip of doing my part towards giving you a ju&s;ter notion of &s;ome other particulars, relating both to him and my&s;elf, which have been indu&s;triou&s;ly mi&s;repre&s;ented to you.</P>
<P>In March la&s;t he received a letter from you, which not being able to read, he de&s;ired me to read to him; &s;everal of the expre&s;&s;ions whereof I perfectly remem|ber, and &s;hall do, till I too am called hence. I then determined, that if God was plea&s;ed to take a thy your &s;on before me, I would ju&s;tify him and my&s;elf, which I now do with all plainne&s;s and &s;implicity, as both my character and cau&s;e requires.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="029861_0007_0FE2A85C2B2E65C8">
In one practice for which you blamed your &s;on, I am only concerned as a friend, not as a partner. That therefore I &s;hall con&s;ider fir&s;t: your own ac|count of it was in effect this, <Q>He frequently went into poor people's hou&s;es in the villages about Holt, called their children together, and in&s;tructed them in their duty to God, their neighbour, and them|&s;elves. He likewi&s;e explained to them the nece&s;&s;ity of private as well as public prayer, and provided them with &s;uch forms as were be&s;t &s;uited to their &s;everal capacities: and being well apprized how much the &s;ucce&s;s of his endeavours depended on their good|will towards him, to win upon their affections, he &s;ometimes di&s;tributed among them a little of that money which he had &s;aved from gaming, and the other fa&s;hionable expen&s;es of the place.</Q> This is the fir&s;t charge again&s;t him; upon which all that I &s;hall ob&s;erve is, that I will refer it to your own judg|ment, whether it be fitter to have a place in the cata|logue of his faults, or of tho&s;e virtues, for which he is <HI>now numbered among the &s;ons of God.</HI></P>
<P>If all the per&s;ons concerned in "that ridiculous &s;ociety, who&s;e follies you have &s;o often heard repeat|ed," could but give &s;uch a proof of their de&s;erving the glorious title
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Holy Club.</NOTE> which was once be&s;towed upon them, they would be contented that their <HI>lives</HI> too <HI>&s;hould be counted madne&s;s, and their end thought to be with|out honour.</HI> But the truth is, theft title to holine&s;s &s;tands upon much le&s;s &s;table foundations; as you will ea&s;ily perceive when you know the ground of this wonderful outcry, which it &s;eems, England is not wide enough to contain.</P>
<P>In November, 1729, at which time I came to re|fine at Oxford, your &s;on, my brother, my&s;elf, and one more, agreed to &s;pend three or four evenings in in week together Our de&s;ign was to read over the
<PB N="9" REF="029861_0008_0FE2A85DC0542AE0">cla&s;&s;icks, which we had before read in private, on common nights, and on Sunday &s;ome book in d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">|ty. In the &s;ummer following Mr. M. told me he had called at the gaol, to &s;ee a man who was con|demed for killing his wife; and that, from the talk he had with one of the debtors, he verily believed it would do much good, if any one would be at the pains of now and then &s;peaking with them. This he &s;o frequently repeated, that on the 24th of Aug. 1730, my brother and I walked with him to the ca&s;tle. We were &s;o well &s;atisfied with our conver&s;ation there, that we agreed to go thither once or twice a week; which we had not done long, before he de&s;ired me, to go with him to &s;ee a poor woman in the town who was &s;ick. In this employment too when we came to reflect upon it, we believed it would be worth while to &s;pend an hour or two in a week, provided the mini&s;ter of the pari&s;h, in which any &s;uch per&s;on was, were not again&s;t it. But that we might not depend wholly on our own judgments, I wrote an account to my father of our whole de&s;ign; withal begging that he, who had lived &s;eventy years in the world, and &s;een as much of it as mo&s;t private men have ever done, would advi&s;e us whether we had yet gone too far, and whether we &s;hould now &s;tand &s;till, or go forward?</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Part of his an&s;wer, dated Sept. 21, 1730, was this:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>"And now as to your own de&s;igns and employ|ments, what can I &s;ay le&s;s of them than <HI>valde proho:</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I greatly approve.</NOTE> and that I have the highe&s;t rea&s;on to ble&s;s God, that he has given me two &s;ons together at Oxford, to whom he has given grace and courage to turn the war again&s;t the world and the devil, which is the be&s;t way to conquer them. They have but one more ene|my to combat with, the fle&s;h; which if they take
<PB N="10" REF="029861_0009_0FE2A860695E7FF8">care to &s;ubdue by fa&s;ting and prayer, there will be no more for them to do, but to proceed &s;teadily in the &s;ame cour&s;e, and expect the crown which fadeth not away. You have rea&s;on to ble&s;s God, as I do, that you have &s;o fa&s;t a friend as Mr. M. who I &s;ee in the mo&s;t difficult &s;ervice is ready to break the ice for you. You do not know of how much good that poor wretch who killed his wife has been the providential occa&s;ion. I think I mu&s;t adopt Mr. M. to be my &s;on, together with you and your brother Charles; and when I have &s;uch a ternion to pro&s;ecute that war, wherein I am now Miles Emeritus, I &s;hall not be a&s;hamed, when they &s;peak with their enemies in the gate."</P>
<P>"I am afraid left the main objection you make again&s;t your going on in the bu&s;ine&s;s with the pri&s;on|ers may &s;ecretly proceed from fle&s;h and blood. For <HI>who can harm you if you are followers of that which is &s;o good?</HI> And which will be one of the marks by which the Shepherd of I&s;rael will know his &s;heep at the la&s;t day?&mdash;Though if it were po&s;&s;ible for you to &s;uffer a little in the cau&s;e, you would have a con|fe&s;&s;or's reward. You own none but &s;uch as are out of their &s;en&s;es would be prejudiced again&s;t your acting in this manner; but &s;ay, "the&s;e are they that need a phy&s;ician." But what if they will not accept of one, who will be welcome to the poor pri&s;oners? Go on then in God's name in the path to which your Saviour has directed you, and that track wherein your father has gone before you! For when I was an under|graduate at Oxford, I vi&s;ited tho&s;e in the ca&s;tle there, and reflect on it with great &s;atisfaction to this day. Walk as prudently as you can, though not fearfully, and my heart and prayers are with you.</P>
<P>"Your fir&s;t regular &s;tep is to con&s;ult with him (if any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ucl. there be) who has a juri&s;diction over the pri&s;oners, and the next is, to obtain the direction
<PB N="11" REF="029861_0010_0FE2A8671BAC1758">and approbation of your bi&s;hop. This is Monday morning, at which time I &s;hall never forget you. If it be po&s;&s;ible I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee you all three here in the fine end of the &s;ummer. But if I can|not have that &s;atisfaction, I am &s;ure I can reach you every day, though you were beyond the Indies. Ac|cordingly, to him, who is every where, I now heartily commit you, as being</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your mo&s;t affectionate and joyful father."</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>In pur&s;uance of the&s;e directions, I immediately went to Mr. Gerard, the Bi&s;hop of Oxford's Chap|lain, who was likewi&s;e the per&s;on that took care of the pri&s;oners when any were condemned to die (at other times they were left to their own care): I pro|po&s;ed to him our de&s;ign of &s;erving them as far as we could, and my own intention to preach there once a month, if the Bi&s;hop approved of it. He much com|mended our de&s;ign, and &s;aid he would an&s;wer for the Bi&s;hop's approbation, to whom he would take the fir&s;t opportunity of mentioning it. It was not long before he informed me he had done &s;o, and that his lord&s;hip not only gave his permi&s;&s;ion, but was greatly plea&s;ed with the undertaking, and hoped it would have the de&s;ired &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Soon after a gentleman of Merton college, who was one of our little company, which now con&s;i&s;ted of five per&s;ons, acquainted us, that he had been much rallied the day before for being a member of <HI>the holy club;</HI> and that it was become a common topic of mirth at his college, where they had found out &s;eve|ral of our cu&s;toms, to which we were our&s;elves utter &s;trangers. Upon this I con&s;ulted my father again, in who&s;e an&s;wer were the&s;e words.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Upon this encouragement we &s;till continued to meet together as u&s;ual; and to confirm one another as well as we could, in our re&s;olutions, to communicate as often as we had opportunity (which is here once a week;) and do what &s;ervice we could to our acquaint|ance, the pri&s;oners, and two or three poor families in
<PB N="13" REF="029861_0012_0FE2A86BC7AC2838">the town. But the outcry daily increa&s;ing, that we might &s;hew what ground there was for it, we propo&s;ed to our friends, or opponents, as we had opportunity, the&s;e, or the like que&s;tions:</P>
<P N="1">I. Whether it does not concern all men of all con|ditions, to imitate him as much as they can, <HI>who went about doing good?</HI></P>
<P>Whether all Chri&s;tians are not concerned in that command, <HI>"While we have time let us do good to all men."</HI></P>

<P>Whether of the nece&s;&s;ity of method and indu&s;try in order to either learning or virtue?</P>

This much de|lighted our gay opponents, who increa&s;ed their num|ber apace, e&s;pecially when &s;hortly after one of the &s;eniors of the college having been with the doctor, upon his return from him, &s;ent for two young gen|tlemen &s;everally, who had communicated weekly for &s;ome time; and was &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful in his exhortations, that for the future they promi&s;ed to do it, only three times a year. About this time there was a meeting (as one who was pre&s;ent at it informed your &s;on) of &s;everal of the officers and &s;eniors of the college, where|in it was con&s;ulted what would be the &s;peedie&s;t way to &s;top the progre&s;s of enthu&s;ia&s;m in it. The re&s;ult we know not, only it was &s;oon publicly reported, that Dr. &mdash;, and the cen&s;ors were going to blow up <HI>the godly club.</HI> This was now our common title, though we were &s;ometimes dignified with that of <HI>the enthu&s;ia&s;ts,</HI> or <HI>the reforming club."</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>"<HI>Good Sir,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A pretty while after the date, yours came to my hand. I waved my an&s;wer till I had an opportunity of con&s;ulting your father, who upon all accounts is a more proper judge of the affair than I am. But I
<PB N="17" REF="029861_0016_0FE2A87A2A9B8050">could never find a fit occa&s;ion for it. As to my own &s;en&s;e of the matter, I confe&s;s, I cannot but heartily approve of that &s;erious and religious turn of mind that prompts you and your a&s;&s;ociates to tho&s;e pious and charitable offices; and can have no notions of that man's religion or concern for the honour of the univer&s;ity, that oppo&s;es you as far as your de&s;ign re|&s;pects the colleges. I &s;hould be loth to &s;end a &s;on of mine to any &s;eminary, where his conver&s;ing with virtuous young men, who&s;e profe&s;t de&s;ign of meeting together at proper times, was to a&s;&s;i&s;t each other in forming good re&s;olutions, and encouraging one ano|ther to execute them with con&s;tancy and &s;teadine&s;s, was incon&s;i&s;tent with any received maxims or rules of life among the members. As to the other branch of your de&s;ign, as the town is divided into pari&s;hes, each of which has its proper incumbent, and as there is probably an eccle&s;ia&s;tic, who has the &s;piritual charge of the pri&s;oners, prudence may direct you to con&s;ult them: for though I dare not &s;ay you would be too officions, &s;hould you of your own mere motion &s;eek out the per&s;ons that want your in&s;tructions and charit|able contributions, yet &s;hould you have the concur|rence of their proper pa&s;tor your good offices would be more regular, and le&s;s liable to cen&s;ure."</P>
<P>Your &s;on was now at Holt; however, we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> ed to meet at our u&s;ual times, though our little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> went on but heavily without him. But at our return from Lincoln&s;hire, in September la&s;t, we had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing him again; when, though he could not be &s;o active with us as formerly, yet we were ex|ceeding glad to &s;pend what time we could in talking and reading with him. It was a little before this time my brother and I were at London, when going into a book&s;eller's &s;hop (Mr. Rivington's in St. Paul's Church-yard) after &s;ome other conver&s;ation, he a&s;ked us whether we lived in town; and upon our an&s;wering,
<PB N="18" REF="029861_0017_0FE2A87BB9EEFE60">"No, at Oxford:" Then gentlemen, &s;aid he, let me earne&s;tly recommend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> your acquaintance a friend I have there, Mr. Clayton of Brazen-no&s;e. Of this, having &s;mall lei&s;ure for contracting new acquaintance, we took no notice for the pre&s;ent. But in the &s;pring following (April 20) Mr. Clayton meeting me in the &s;reet, and giving Mr. Rivington's &s;ervice, I de&s;ired his company to my room, and then commenced our acquaintance. At the fir&s;t opportunity I acquainted him with our whole de&s;ign, which he immediately and heartily clo&s;ed with: and not long after, Mr. M&mdash; having then left Oxford, we fixed two even|ings in a week to meet on, partly to talk upon that &s;ubject, and partly to read &s;omething in practical di|vinity.</P>
<P>The two points, whereunto by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, and your &s;on's help, we had before attained, we en|deavoured to hold fa&s;t: I mean, the doing what good we can, and in order thereto communicating as often as we have opportunity. To the&s;e, by the ad|vice of Mr. Clayton, we have added a third, the ob|&s;erving the fa&s;ts of the church; the general neglect of which we can by no means apprehend to be a lawful excu&s;e for neglecting them. And in the re&s;olution to adhere to the&s;e, and all things el&s;e which we are con|vinced God requires at our hands, we tru&s;t we &s;hall per&s;evere, till he calls us to give an account of our &s;teward&s;hip. As for the names of Methodi&s;ts, Su|pererogation-men, and &s;o on, with which &s;ome of our neighbours are plea&s;ed to compliment us, we do not conceive our&s;elves to be under any obligation to regard them, much le&s;s to take them for arguments. To the law and to the te&s;timony we appeal, whereby we ought to be judged. If by the&s;e it can be proved we are in an error, we will immediately and gladly retract it: if not, we <HI>have not &s;o learned Chri&s;t,</HI> as to renounce any part of his &s;ervice, though men &s;hould

We do indeed u&s;e all the lawful means we know, to prevent <HI>the good which is in us</HI> from being <HI>evil &s;poken of;</HI> but if the neglect of known duties be the one condition of &s;ecuring our reputation, why fare it well;&mdash;we know whom we have believed, and what we thus lay out he will pay us again. Your &s;on already &s;tands before the judg|ment-&s;eat of him who judges righteous judgment; at the brightne&s;s of who&s;e pre&s;ence the clouds remove; his eyes are open, and he &s;ees clearly whether it was "Blind zeal and a thorough mi&s;take of true religion, that hurried him on in the error of his way," or whether he acted like a faithful and wi&s;e &s;ervant, who from a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e that his time was &s;hort, made ha&s;te to fini&s;h his work before his Lord's coming, that when <HI>laid in the balance</HI> he might not <HI>be &s;ound wanting.</HI></P>
<P>I have now largely and plainly laid before you the real ground of all the &s;trange outcry you have heard; and am not without hope that by this fairer repre|&s;entation of it than you probably ever received before, both you and the clergy man you formerly mentioned may have a more favourable opinion of a good cau&s;e, tho' under an ill name.

<HEAD>JOURNAL From <HI>Oct.</HI> 14, 1735, to <HI>Feb.</HI> 1, 1738.</HEAD>
<P>TUESDAY, Oct. 14, 1735, Mr. Benjamin Ingham, of Queen's-College, Oxford, Mr. Charles Delamotte, &s;on of a merchant in London, who had offered him&s;elf &s;ome days before, my brother Charles We&s;ley, and my&s;elf, took boat for Grave&s;end, in order to embark for Georgia. Our end in leaving our native country, was not to avoid want (God having given us plenty of temporal ble&s;&s;ings) nor to gain the dung or dro&s;s of riches or honour: but &s;ingly this, to &s;ave our &s;ouls: to live wholly to the glory of God. In the afternoon we found the Simmonds off Grave&s;|end, and immediately went on board.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day and Thur&s;day we &s;pent with one or two of our friends, partly on board and partly on &s;hore, in exhorting one another <HI>to &s;hake off every weight, and to run with patience the race &s;et before us.</HI></P>
<P>Friday 17. I began to learn German, in order to conver&s;e with the Germans, &s;ix and twenty of whom we had on board. On Sunday, the weather being fair and calm, we had the morning-&s;ervice on quarter|deck. I now fir&s;t preached <HI>ex tempore,</HI> and then ad|mini&s;tered the Lord's &s;upper to &s;ix or &s;even communi|cants. A little flock. May God increa&s;e it!</P>
<P>Monday 20. Believing the denying our&s;elves even in the &s;malle&s;t in&s;tances, might, by the ble&s;&s;ing of
<PB N="24" REF="029861_0023_0FE2A894393C0DC8">God, be helpful to us, we wholly left off the u&s;e of fle&s;h and wine, and confined our&s;elves to vegetable food, chiefly rice and bi&s;cuit. In the afternoon David Nitchman, bi&s;hop of the Germans, and two others began to learn Engli&s;h. O may we be, not only of one tongue, but of one mind and of one heart!</P>
<P>Tue&s;. 21. We failed from Grave&s;end. When we were pa&s;t about half the Goodwin Sands, the wind &s;uddenly failed. Had the calm continued till ebb, the &s;hip had probably been lo&s;t. But the gale &s;prung up again in an hour, and carried us into the Downs.</P>
<P>We now began to be a little regular. Our com|mon way of living was this. From four in the morn|ing till five, each of us u&s;ed private prayer. From five to &s;even we read the bible together, carefully comparing it (that we might not lean to our own un|der&s;tandings) with the writings of the earlie&s;t ages. At &s;even we breakfa&s;ted. At eight were the public prayers. From nine to twelve I u&s;ually learned Ger|man, and Mr. Delamotte, Greek. My brother writ &s;ermons, and Mr. Ingham in&s;tructed the children. At twelve we met to give an account to one another what we had done &s;ince our la&s;t meeting, and what we de&s;igned to do before our next. About one we dined. The time from dinner to four, we &s;pent in reading to tho&s;e of whom each of us had taken in charge, or in &s;peaking to them &s;everally, as need re|quired. At four were the evening prayers; when either the &s;econd le&s;&s;on was explained (as it always was in the morning) or the children were catechi&s;ed, and in&s;tructed before the congregation. From five to &s;ix we again u&s;ed private prayer. From &s;ix to &s;even I read in our cabin to two or three of the pa&s;&s;engers (of whom there were about eighty Engli&s;h on board) and each of my brethren to a few more in theirs. At &s;even I joined with the Germans in their public &s;ervice; while Mr. Ingham was reading between the decks, to
<PB N="25" REF="029861_0024_0FE2A895CB8EC550">as many as de&s;ired to hear. At eight we met again, to exhort and in&s;truct one another. Between nine and ten we went to bed, where neither the roaring of the &s;ea, nor the the motion of the &s;hip, could take away the refre&s;hing &s;leep which God gave us.</P>
<P>Friday 24. Having a rolling &s;ea, mo&s;t of the pa&s;|&s;engers found the effects of it. Mr. Delamotte was exceeding &s;ick, for &s;everal days: Mr. Ingham for about half an hour. My brother's head ached much. Hitherto it has plea&s;ed God, the &s;ea has not di&s;order|ed me at all; nor have I been hindered one quarter of an hour from reading, writing, compo&s;ing, or doing any bu&s;ine&s;s I could have done on &s;hore.</P>
<P>During our &s;tay in the Downs, &s;ome or other of us went, as often as we had opportunity, on board the &s;hip that failed in company with us, where al&s;o many were glad to join in prayer and hearing the word.</P>
<P>Friday 31. We failed out of the Downs. At eleven at night I was waked by a great noi&s;e. I &s;oon found there was no danger. But the bare apprehen&s;ion of it, gave me a lively conviction what manner of men tho&s;e ought to be, who are every moment on the bri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k of eternity.</P>
<P>Sat. Nov. 1. We came to St. Helen's harbour, and the next day into Cowes road. The wind was fair, but we waited for the man of war, which was to fail with us. This was a happy opportunity of in&s;tructing our fellow-travellers. May he who&s;e feed we &s;ow, give it the increa&s;e!</P>
<P>Sund. 16. Thomas Hird, and Grace his wife, with their children, Mark, aged 21, and Phebe, about 17, late quakers, were, at their often-repeated de&s;ire, and after careful instruction, admitted to bap|ti&s;m.</P>
<P>Thur. 20. We fell down into Yarmouth road, but the next day were forced back into Cowes. During our &s;tay here there were &s;everal &s;torms: in one of which two &s;hips in Yarmouth road were lo&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="029861_0025_0FE2A898424E2A08">
The continuance of the contrary winds gave my brother an opportunity of complying with the de&s;ire of the mini&s;ter of Cowes, and preaching there three or four times. The poor people flocked together in great numbers. We di&s;tributed a few little books among the &s;erious of them, which they received with all po&s;&s;ible expre&s;&s;ions of thankfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>Fri. 21. One recovering from a dangerous illne&s;s, de&s;ired to be in&s;tructed in the nature of the Lord's &s;upper. I thought it concerned her to be fir&s;t in|&s;tructed in the nature of Chri&s;tianity: and accordingly fixed an hour a day to read with her in Mr. Law's Treati&s;e on Chri&s;tian Perfection.</P>
<P>Sund. 23. At night I was waked by the to&s;&s;ing of the &s;hip and roaring of the wind, and plainly &s;hewed I was unfit, for I was unwilling to die.</P>
<P>Tue&s;. Dec. 2. I had much &s;atisfaction in conver&s;|ing with one that was very ill and very &s;erious. But in a few days &s;he recovered from her &s;ickne&s;s and from her &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s together.</P>
<P>Sund. 7. Finding nature did not require &s;o frequent &s;upplies as we had been accu&s;tomed to, we agreed to le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> off &s;uppers; from doing which we have hitherto found <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o inconvenience.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;. 10. We failed from Cowes, and in the afternoon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Needles. Here the ragged rocks, with the waves da&s;hing and foaming at the foot of them, and the white &s;ide of the i&s;land ri&s;ing to &s;uch a height, perpendicular from the beach, gave a &s;trong idea of <HI>him that &s;pauneth the heavens, and holdeth the waters in the hollow of his hand!</HI></P>
<P>To day I &s;poke clo&s;ely on the head of religion, to one I had talked with once or twice before. After|wards &s;he &s;aid, with many tears, "My mother died when I was but ten years old. Some of her la&s;t words were, "Child, fear God; and though y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> lo&s;e me,
<PB N="27" REF="029861_0026_0FE2A89DB7EC0A40">you &s;hall never want a friend." I have now found a friend, when I mo&s;t wanted, and le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pected one."</P>
<P>From this day to the 14th, being in the Bay of Bi&s;cay, the &s;ea was very rough. Mr. Delamotte and many others were mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;ick than ever: Mr. Ing|ham a little; I not at all. But the 14th being a calm day, mo&s;t of the &s;ick were cured at once.</P>
<P>Thur&s;. 18. One who was big with child, in a high fever, and almo&s;t wa&s;ted away with a violent cough, de&s;ired to receive the holy communion before fire died. At the hour of her receiving, &s;he began to recover, and in a few days was entirely out of danger.</P>
<P>Sund. 21. We had fifteen communicants, which was our u&s;ual number on Sundays: on Chri&s;tmas-day we had nineteen; but on New-year's-day fifteen only.</P>
<P>Thur&s;. Jan. 15, 1736. Complaint being made to Mr. Oglethorpe, of the unequal di&s;tribution of the water among the pa&s;&s;engers, he appointed new officers to take charge of it. At this the old ones and their friends were highly exa&s;perated again&s;t us, to w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> they imputed the change. But <HI>the fiercene&s;s of ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> turn to thy prai&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Sat. 17. Many people were very impati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> contrary wind. At &s;even in the evening <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> were quieted by a &s;torm. It ro&s;e higher <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her till nine. About nine the &s;ea broke over us from &s;tem to &s;tern; bur&s;t through the windows of the &s;tate cabin, where three or four of us were, and covered us all over, though a bureau &s;heltered me from the main &s;hock. About eleven I lay down in the great cabin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n a &s;hort time fell a&s;leep, though very uncertain whether I &s;hould wake alive, and much a&s;hamed of my unwil|lingne&s;s to die. O how pure in heart mu&s;t he be, who would rejoice to appear before God at a moment's warning! Toward morning, <HI>he rebuked the winds and the &s;ea, and there was a great calm.</HI></P>

Sund. 18. We returned God thanks for our deli|verance, of which a few appeared duly &s;en&s;ible. But the re&s;t (among whom were mo&s;t of the &s;ailors) denied we had been in any danger. I could not have believed that &s;o little good would have been done by the terror they were in before. But it cannot be that they &s;hould long obey God from fear, who are deaf to the motives of love.</P>
<P>Fri. 25. In the evening another &s;torm began. In the morning it increa&s;ed, &s;o that they were forced to let the &s;hip drive. I could not but &s;ay to my&s;elf, <HI>How is it that thou ha&s;t no faith?</HI> Being &s;till unwilling to die. About one in the afternoon, almo&s;t as &s;oon as I had &s;tept out of the great cabin door, the &s;ea did not break as u&s;ual, but came with a full, &s;mooth tide over the &s;ide of the &s;hip. I was vaulted over with water in a moment, and &s;o &s;tunned, that I &s;carce expected to lift up my head again, till the &s;ea &s;hould give up her dead. But, thanks be to God, I received no hurt at all. About midnight the &s;torm cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Sund. 25. At noon, our third &s;torm began. At <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> was more violent than before. Now indeed we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ay, <HI>the waves</HI> of the &s;ea were <HI>mighty and raged hor|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> they ro&s;e up to the heavens above, and</HI> cleave <HI>down to he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">.</HI> The winds roared round about us, and (what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> heard before) whi&s;tled as di&s;tinctly as if it had been a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> voice. The &s;hip not only rocked to and fro with the utmo&s;t violence, but &s;hook and jarred with &s;o unequal, grating a motion, that one could not but with great difficulty keep one's hold of any thing, nor &s;tand a moment without it. Every ten minutes came a &s;hock again&s;t the &s;tern or &s;ide of the &s;hip, which one would think &s;hould da&s;h the planks in pieces. At this time, a child, privately baptised before, was brought to be received into the church. It put me in mind of Jeremiah's buying the field, when the Chaldeans were on the point of de&s;troying
<PB N="29" REF="029861_0028_0FE2A8A1F8A7FB88">Jeru&s;alem, and &s;eemed a pledge of the mercy God de&s;igned to &s;hew us, even in the land of the living.</P>
<P>We &s;pent two or three hours after prayers, in con|ver&s;ing &s;uitably to the occa&s;ion, confirming one ano|ther in a calm &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, to the wi&s;e, holy, gracious will of God. And now a &s;torm did not appear &s;o terrible as before. Ble&s;&s;ed be the God of all con&s;o|lation!</P>
<P>At &s;even I went to the Germans. I had long be|fore ob&s;erved, the great &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of their behaviour. Of their humility they had given a continual proof, by performing tho&s;e &s;ervile offices for the other pa&s;&s;engers, which none of the Engli&s;h would undertake, for which they de&s;ired, and would receive no pay, &s;aying, "It was good for their proud hearts," and "Their loving Savi|our had done more for them." And every day had given them occa&s;ion of &s;hewing a meekne&s;s, which no injury could move. If they were pu&s;hed, &s;truck, or thrown down, they ro&s;e again and went away; but no com|plaint was found in their mouth. There was now an opportunity of trying, whether they were deliv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from the &s;pirit of fear, as well as from that off <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> anger and revenge.

He an&s;wered, "I thank God, No." I a&s;ked, "But were not your women and children afraid?" He re|plied mildly, "No; our women and children are not afraid to die."</P>
<P>From them I went to their crying, trembling neigh|bours, and pointed out to them the difference in the hour of trial, between him that feareth God, and him
<PB N="30" REF="029861_0029_0FE2A8A476EE4950">that feareth him not. At twelve the wind fell. This was the mo&s;t glorious day which I have hitherto &s;een.</P>
<P>Mond. 26. We enjoyed the calm. I can conceive no difference, comparable to that between a &s;mooth and a rough &s;ea, except that which is between a mind calmed by the love of God, and one torn up by the &s;torms of earthly pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Thur&s;. Jan. 29. About &s;even in the evening, we fell in with the &s;kirts of a hurricane. The rain as well as the wind was extremely violent. The &s;ky was &s;o dark in a moment, that the &s;ailors could not &s;o much as &s;ee the ropes, or &s;et about furling the &s;ails. The &s;hip mu&s;t in all probability have over&s;et, had not the wind fell as &s;uddenly as it ro&s;e. Toward the end of it, we had that appearance on each of the ma&s;ts, which (it is thought) the ancients called Ca&s;tor and Pollux. It was a &s;mall ball of white fire, like a &s;tar. The mariners &s;ay, it appears either in a &s;torm (and then commonly upon the deck) or ju&s;t at the end of it: and then it is u&s;ually on the ma&s;ts or &s;ails.</P>
<P>Frid. 30. We had another &s;torm, which did us no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> harm, than &s;plitting the fore-&s;ail.

About noon the trees were vi&s;ible from the ma&s;t, and in the after|noon from the main deck. In the evening le&s;&s;on were the&s;e words, <HI>A great door and effectual is opened.</HI> O let no one &s;hut it!</P>
<P>Thur&s;. Feb. 5. Between two and three in the after|noon, God brought us all &s;afe into the Savannah river. We ca&s;t anchor near Tybee-i&s;land, where the groves of pines, running along the &s;hore, made an agreeable pro&s;pect, &s;hewing as it were, the bloom of &s;pring, in the depth of winter.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="029861_0030_0FE2A8AC02C4D4F0">
Frid. 6. About eight in the morning, we fir&s;t &s;et foot on American ground. It was a &s;mall uninhabited i&s;land, over again&s;t Tybee. Mr. Oglethorpe led us to a ri&s;ing ground, where we all kneeled down to give thanks. He then took boat for Savannah. When the re&s;t of the people were come on &s;hore, we called our little flock together to prayers. Several parts of the &s;econd le&s;&s;on, Mark. vi. were wonderfully &s;uited to the occa&s;ion; in particular, the account of the courage and &s;ufferings of John the bapti&s;t; our Lord's directions to the fir&s;t preachers of his go&s;pel and their toiling at &s;ea, and deliverance with tho&s;e comfortable words, <HI>It is I, be not afraid.</HI></P>
<P>Sat. Feb. 7, M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. Oglethorpe returned from Savan|nah, with Mr. Spangenberg, one of the pa&s;tors of the Germans. I &s;oon found what &s;pirit he was of; and a&s;ked his advice with regard to my own conduct. He &s;aid, <Q>My brother, I mu&s;t fir&s;t a&s;k you one or two que&s;tions. Have you the witne&s;s within your|&s;elf? Does the Spirit of God bear witne&s;s with your &s;pirit, that you are a child of God?</Q> I was fur|prized, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ew not what to an&s;wer. He ob&s;erved it, and a&s;ked, "Do you know Je&s;us Chri&s;t?" I pau&s;ed and &s;aid, "I know he is the Saviour of the world." <Q>True; replied he; but do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> know he has &s;aved you?</Q> I an&s;wered "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ope he has died to &s;ave me." He only ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> "Do you know your&s;elf?" I &s;aid, "I do." But I fear, they were vain words.</P>
<P>Mond. 9. I a&s;ked him many que&s;tions, both con|cerning him&s;elf, and the church at Hernhuth. The &s;ub&s;tance of his an&s;wers was this.</P>
<P>"At eighteen years old I was &s;ent to the univer|&s;ity of Jena, where I &s;pent &s;ome years in learning languages, and the vain philo&s;ophy, which I have now long been labouring to forget. Here it plea&s;ed God by &s;ome that preached his word with power, to over|turn
<PB N="32" REF="029861_0031_0FE2A8ADF33AE9F8"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urn my heart. I immediately threw a&s;ide all my learning, but what tended to &s;ave my &s;oul. I &s;hun|ned all company, and retired into a &s;olitary place, re|&s;olving to &s;pend my life there. For three days I had much comfort here; but on the fourth it was all gone. I was amazed, and went for advice to an experienced Chri&s;tian. When I came to him, I could not &s;peak. But he &s;aw my heart, and advi&s;ed me to go back to my hou&s;e, and follow the bu&s;ine&s;s providence called me to. I went back, but was fit for nothing. I could neither do bu&s;ine&s;s, nor join in any conver&s;ation. All I could &s;ay to any one, was Yes, or No. Many times I could not &s;ay that, nor under&s;tand the plaine&s;t thing that was &s;aid to me. My friends and acquaintance looked upon me as dead, came no more to me, nor &s;poke about me.</P>
<P>"When I grew better, I began teaching &s;ome poor children. Others joining with me, we taught more and more, till there were above thirty teachers and above two hundred &s;cholars. I had now invitations to other univer&s;ities. But I could not accept of any: de&s;iring only, if it were the will of God, to be little and unknown. I had &s;pent &s;ome years thus, when profe&s;&s;or Breithaupt of Halle died: being then pre&s;&s;ed to remove thither, I believed it was the call of God, and went. I had not been long there, before many faults were found, both with my behaviour and preach|ing: and offences increa&s;ed more and more, till after half a year, a petition again&s;t me was &s;ent to the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, who &s;ent an order to the commander at Halle, in pur&s;uance whereof I was warned to leave the city in forty-eight hours. I did &s;o, and retired to Hernhuth, to Count Zinzendorf.</P>
<P>"The village of Hernhuth contains about a thou|&s;and &s;ouls, gathered out of many nations. They hold <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the di&s;cipline, as well as the faith and practice of the apo&s;tolical church. I was de&s;ired by the brethren

<P>I a&s;ked, "Whither he was to go next?" He &s;aid, "I have thoughts of going to Penn&s;ylvania. But what God will do with me, I know not. I am blind. I am a child. My father knows, and I am ready to go wherever he calls."</P>
<P>Frid. 13. Some of the Indians &s;ent us word of their intention to come down to us. In our cour&s;e of reading to day, were the&s;e words; <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts, It &s;hall yet come to pa&s;s that there &s;hall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities. And the inha|bitants of one city &s;hall go to another, &s;aying, Let us go &s;peedily to pray before the Lord, and to &s;eek the Lord of ho&s;ts: I will go al&s;o. Yea many people and &s;trong nations, &s;hall come to &s;eek the Lord of ho&s;ts, and to pray before him.</HI> Zech. xiii. 20, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Sat. Feb. 14. About one, Tomo-Chachi, his ne|phew Thleeanouhee, his wife Sinauky, with two more women and two or three Indian children, came on board. As &s;oon as we came in, they all ro&s;e, and &s;hook us by the hand, and Tomo-Chachi (one Mrs. Mu&s;grove intepreted) &s;poke as follows.</P>
<P>"I am glad you are come. When I was in Eng|land I de&s;ired that &s;ome would &s;peak <HI>the great word</HI> to me. And my nation then de&s;ired to hear it. But now we are all in confu&s;ion. Yet I am glad you are come. I will go up and &s;peak to the wi&s;e men of our nation. And I hope they will hear. But we would not be made Chri&s;tians, as the Spaniards make Chri&s;|tians. We would be taught, before we are baptiz|ed."</P>
<P>I an&s;wered, "There is but one, he that &s;itteth in heaven, who is able to teach man wi&s;dom. Tho' we are come &s;o far, we know not whether he will plea&s;e to teach you by us or no If He teaches you, you will
<PB N="34" REF="029861_0033_0FE2A8B200E96218">learn wi&s;dom; but we can do nothing." We then withdrew.</P>
<P>Sund. 15. Another party of Indians came. They were all tall, well-proportioned men, and had a re|markable &s;oftne&s;s in their &s;peech, and gentlene&s;s in their whole behaviour. In the afternoon they all re|turned home, but three, who &s;tayed to go with Mr. Oglethorpe.</P>
<P>Monday, Feb. 16. Mr. Oglethorpe &s;et out for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> new &s;ettlement on the Alatamahaw river. He took with him 50 men; be&s;ides Mr. Ingham, Mr. Herm&s;dorf and the three Indians.</P>
<P>Thur&s;, 19. My brother and I took boat, and pa&s;&s;ing by Savannah, went to pay our fir&s;t vi&s;it in A|merica, to the poor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. But neither Tomo Chachi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nor Sinauky were as home. Coming back, we waited upon Mr. Cau&s;ton, the chief magi&s;trate of Savannah. From him we went with Mr. Spangen|berg to the German brethren. About eleven we re|turned to the boat, and came to our &s;hip about four in the morning.</P>
<P>Sat. 21. Mary Welch, aged eleven days, was baptized according to the cu&s;tom of the fir&s;t church, and the rule of the church of England. The child was ill then, but recovered from that hour.</P>
<P>Tu. 24. Mr. Oglethorpe returned. The day fol|lowing I took my leave of mo&s;t of the pa&s;&s;engers of the &s;hip; who all appeared &s;erious. I may be, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the &s;eed is not fallen upon &s;tony ground.</P>
<P>In the evening I went to Savannah again, whence Mr. Spangenberg, bi&s;hop Nit&s;cman and Andrew Do|ber, went up with us to Mrs. Mu&s;grove's, to chu&s;e a &s;pot for the little hou&s;e which Mr. Oglethorpe had promi&s;ed to build us. Being afterward di&s;appointed of our boat, we were obliged to pa&s;s the night there.
<PB N="35" REF="029861_0034_0FE2A8B7405BF310">But wherever we are, it is the &s;ame thing, if it be the will of our Father which is in heaven.</P>
<P>At our return the next day (Mr. Quincy being then in the hou&s;e wherein we afterwards were) Mr. Delamotte and I took up our lodging with the Ger|mans. We had now an opportunity day by day, of ob&s;erving their whole behaviour. For we were in one room with them from morning to night, unle&s;s for the little time I &s;pent in walking. They were always employed, always chearful them&s;elves, and in good humour with one another. They had put away all anger and &s;trife, and wrath and bitterne&s;s and clamour, and evil-&s;peaking. They walked worthy of the voca|tion wherewith they were called, and adorned the go&s;|pel of our Lord in all things.</P>
<P>Sat. Feb. 28. They met to con&s;ult concerning the affairs of their church: Mr. Spangenberg being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to go to Penn&s;ylvania, and bi&s;hop Nit&s;chman to return to Germany. After &s;everal hours &s;pent in conference and prayer, they proceeded to the election and ordination of a bi&s;hop. The great &s;implicity as well as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">emnity of the whole, almo&s;t made me for|get the &s;eventeen hundred years between, and imagine my&s;elf in one of tho&s;e affemblies, where form and &s;tate were not: but Paul the tent-maker or Peter the fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|erman prefided; yet with the demon&s;tration of the &s;pi|rit and of power.</P>
<P>Sund. 29. Hearing Mr. Oglethorpe did not come any more to Savannah, before he went to Frederica, I was obliged to go down to the &s;hip again (Mr Spangenberg followed me thither) and receive his or|ders and in&s;tructions on &s;everal heads. From him we went to public prayers: after which we were refre&s;hed by &s;everal letters from England. Upon which I could not but ob&s;erve how careful our Lord is, to re|pay whatever we give up on his account. When I left England, I was chiefly afraid of two things; one,
<PB N="36" REF="029861_0035_0FE2A8B9E0077A68">that I &s;hould never again have &s;o many faithful friends as I left there; the other, that the &s;park of love which began to kindle in their hearts, would cool and die a|way. But who knoweth the mercy and power of God? From ten friends I am a while &s;ecluded: and he hath opened me a door into a whole church. And as to the very per&s;ons I left behind, his &s;pirit is gone forth &s;o much the more, teaching them not to tru&s;t in man, but <HI>in him that rai&s;ed the dead, and calleth the things that are not, as though they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI></P>
<P>About four, having taken leave of Mr. Spangen|berg, who was the next morning to &s;et out for Penn|&s;ylvania, I returned to Savannah. Sat. March 6. I had a long conver&s;ation with John Reinier, the &s;on of a gentleman, who being driven out of France, on ac|count of his religion, &s;ettled at Vivay in Swi&s;&s;erland, and practi&s;ed phy&s;ic there. His father died while he was a child. Some years after he told his mother, he was de&s;irous to leave Swi&s;&s;erland, and to retire into &s;ome other country, where he might be free from the temptations which he could not avoid there. When her con&s;ent was at length obtained, he agreed with a ma&s;ter of a ve&s;&s;el, with whom he went to Holland by land; thence to England, and from England to Penn|&s;ylvania. He was provided with money, books and drugs, intending to follow his father's profe&s;&s;ion. But no &s;ooner was he come to Philadelphia, than the cap|tain who had borrowed his money before, in&s;tead of repaying it, demanded the full pay for his pa&s;&s;age, and under that pretence &s;eized on all his effects. He then left him in a &s;trange country, where he could not &s;peak to be under&s;tood, without nece&s;&s;aries, money or friends. In this condition he thought it be&s;t to &s;ell him&s;elf for a &s;ervant, which he accordingly did, for &s;even years. When about five were expired, he fell &s;ick of a lingering illne&s;s, which made him u&s;ele&s;s to his ma&s;ter; who after it had continued half a year,
<PB N="37" REF="029861_0036_0FE2A8BB6E915F18">would not keep him any longer, but turned him out to &s;hift for him&s;elf. He fir&s;t tried to mend &s;hoes, but &s;oon after joined him&s;elf to &s;ome French pro|te&s;tants, and learned to make buttons. He then went and lived with an anabapti&s;t: but &s;oon after hearing an account of the Germans in Georgia, walked from Penn&s;ylvania thither, where he found the re&s;t, which he had &s;o long &s;ought in vain.</P>
<P>Sund. March 7. I entered upon my mini&s;try at Savannah, by preaching on the epi&s;tle for the day, being the 13th of the fir&s;t Corinthians. In the &s;e|cond le&s;&s;on, Luke xviii. was our Lord's prediction of the treatment which he him&s;elf (and con&s;equently his followers) was to meet with from the world; and his gracious promi&s;e to tho&s;e who are content, <HI>Nudi nudum Chri&s;tum &s;equi: Verily I &s;ay unto you, there is no man that hath left hou&s;e, or friends, or brethren, or wife, or children for the kingdom of God's &s;ake, which &s;hall not receive manifold more in this pre&s;ent time, and in the world to come everla&s;ting life.</HI></P>
<P>Yet notwith&s;tanding the&s;e plain declarations of our Lord, notwith&s;tanding my own repeated experience, notwith&s;tanding the experience of all the &s;incere fol|lowers of Chri&s;t, whom I have ever talked with, read or heard of: nay, and the rea&s;on of the thing, evinc|ing to a demon&s;tration, that all who love not the light mu&s;t hate him, who is continually labouring to pour it in upon them: I do here bear witne&s;s again&s;t my|&s;elf, that when I &s;aw the number of people crowding into the church, the deep attention with which they received the word, and the &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s that afterwards &s;at on all their faces; I could &s;carce refrain from giving the lie to experience and rea&s;on and &s;cripture all together. I could hardly believe that the greater, the far greater part of this attentive, &s;erious people, would hereafter trample under foot that word, and &s;ay all manner of evil fal&s;ely of him that &s;pake it. O

<P>This evening one of the Germans, who had been long ill of a con&s;umption, found him&s;elf much wor&s;e. On my mentioning it to bi&s;hop Nit&s;chman he &s;miled and &s;aid, "He will &s;oon be well; he is ready for the bridegroom."</P>
<P>Sund. Mar. 14, Having before given notice of my de&s;ign to do &s;o, every Sunday and holiday, ac|cording to the rules of our church, I admini&s;tered the holy communion to eighteen per&s;ons. Which of the&s;e will endure to the end?</P>
<P>Mond. Mar. 15. Mr. Quincy going for Carolina, I removed into the mini&s;ter's hou&s;e. It is large enough for a larger family than ours and has many convenien|cies, be&s;ides a good garden. I could not but reflect on the well known epigram,

<P>Sund. 28. A &s;ervant of Mr. Bradley's &s;ent to de|&s;ire to &s;peak with me. Going to him, I found a young man ill, but perfectly &s;en&s;ible. He de&s;ired the re&s;t to go out, and then &s;aid, "On Thur&s;day night, about eleven, being in bed, but broad awake, I heard one calling aloud "Peter! Peter Wright!" And looking up, the room was as light as day, and I &s;aw a man in very bright cloaths &s;tand by the bed, who &s;aid, <HI>"Prepare your&s;elf; for your end is nigh;"</HI> and then immediately all was dark as before." I told him, "The advice was good, whence&s;oever it came." In a few days he recovered from his illne&s;s; his whole
<PB N="39" REF="029861_0038_0FE2A8C4F408C148">temper was changed as well as his life; and &s;o con|tinued to be, till after three or four weeks he relap&s;ed and died in peace.</P>
<P>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;. Mar. 30. Mr. Ingham coming from Fre|derica, brought me letters, pre&s;&s;ing me to go thither. The next day Mr. Delamotte and I began to try, whether life might not as well be &s;u&s;tained, by one &s;ort as by a variety of food. We cho&s;e to make the experiment with bread; and were never more vigorous and healthy than while we ta&s;ted nothing el&s;e. <HI>Ble&s;|&s;ed are the pure in heart!</HI> Who whether they eat or drink, or whatever they do, have no end therein but to plea&s;e God! To them all things are pure. Every creature is good to them, and nothing to be rejected. But let them who know and feel, that they are not thus pure, u&s;e every help and remove every hindrance: always remembering, <HI>He that de&s;pi&s;eth little things, &s;hall fall by little and little.</HI></P>
<P>Sund. Apr. 4. About four in the afternoon, I &s;et out for Frederica, in a Pettiawga (a &s;ort of flat-bottomed barge.) The next evening we anchored near Skidoway i&s;land, where the water at flood was twelve or fourteen feet deep. I wrapt my&s;elf up from head to foot, in a large cloak, to keep off the &s;and-flies, and lay down on the quarter-deck. Between one and two I waked under water, being &s;o fa&s;t a&s;leep that I did not find where I was till my mouth was full of it. Having left my cloak, I know not how upon deck, I &s;wam round to the other &s;ide of the Pettiawga, where a boat was tied, and climbed up by the rope, without any hurt, more than wetting my cloaths. Thou art the God of whom cometh &s;alva|tion: thou art the Lord by whom we e&s;cape death.</P>
<P>The winds were &s;o contrary, that on Sat. 10. we could but ju&s;t get over-again&s;t Doboy i&s;land, twenty miles from Frederica, but could not po&s;&s;ibly make the creek, having a &s;trong tide al&s;o again&s;t us. Here we
<PB N="40" REF="029861_0039_0FE2A8C686A00B80">lay beating off till pa&s;t one; when the lightning and rain which we had long &s;een at a di&s;tance, drove down full upon us; till after a quarter of an hour, the clouds parted, &s;ome pa&s;&s;ing on the right, and &s;ome on the left, leaving us a clear &s;ky, and &s;o &s;trong a wind right after us, as in two hours brought us to Frederica.</P>
<P>A little before we landed, I opened my Te&s;tament on the&s;e words, <HI>If God be for us, who can be again&s;t us?</HI> Coming on &s;hore, I found my brother exceeding weak, having been for &s;ome time ill of a flux. But he mended from the hour he &s;aw me. <HI>This</HI> al&s;o <HI>hath</HI> God wrought!</P>
<P>Sund. April 11. I preached at the new Store|hou&s;e on the fir&s;t ver&s;e of the go&s;pel for the day, <HI>Which of you convinceth me of &s;in? And if I &s;ay the truth, why do ye not believe me?</HI> There was a large congregation, whom I endeavoured to convince of unbelief, by &s;imply propo&s;ing the conditions of &s;alva|tion, as they are laid down in &s;cripture, and appealing to their own hearts, whether they believed they could be &s;aved on no other terms?</P>
<P>In every one of the &s;ix following days, I had &s;ome fre&s;h proofs of the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of following that wi&s;e advice of the apo&s;tle, <HI>Judge nothing before the time; until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkne&s;s, and will make manife&s;t the coun&s;els of the hearts.</HI></P>
<P>Sat. April 17. We &s;et out for Savannah, and reached it on Tue&s;day evening. O ble&s;&s;ed place, where having but one end in view, di&s;&s;embling and fraud are not: but each of us can pour out his heart without fear into his brother's bo&s;om!</P>
<P>Not finding as yet any door open, for the pur&s;uing our main de&s;ign, we con&s;idered, in what manner we might be mo&s;t u&s;eful to the little flock at Savannah. And we agreed, 1&s;t. To adv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e the more &s;erious
<PB N="41" REF="029861_0040_0FE2A8C815EA6D88">among them, to form them&s;elves into a &s;ort of little &s;ociety, and to meet once or twice a week, in order to reprove, in&s;truct and exhort one another. 2. To &s;elect out of the&s;e a &s;maller number for a more inti|mate union with each other, which might be forward|ed, partly by our conver&s;ing &s;ingly with each, and partly by inviting them altogether to our hou&s;e; and this accordingly we determined to do every Sunday in the afternoon.</P>
<P>Wed. May 5. I was a&s;ked to baptize a child of Mr. Parker's, &s;econd bailiff of Savannah. But Mrs. Parker told me, "Neither Mr. P. nor I will con|&s;ent to its being dipped." I an&s;wered, "If you <HI>certify that your child is weak, it will &s;uffice</HI> (the ru|brick &s;ays) <HI>to pour water upon it.</HI>" She replied, "Nay the child is not weak; but <HI>I am re&s;olved</HI> it &s;hall not be dipped." This argument I could not confute. So I went home; and the child was baptized by another per&s;on.</P>
<P>Sund. 9. I began dividing the public prayers, according to the original appointment of the church (&s;till ob&s;erved in a few places in England.) The morning &s;ervice began at five. The communion of|fice (with the &s;ermon) at eleven. The evening &s;er|vice about three. And this day I began reading prayers in the Court-hou&s;e; a large and convenient place.</P>
<P>Mond. 10. I began vi&s;iting my pari&s;hioners in or|der, from hou&s;e to hou&s;e; for which I &s;et apart the time (when they can't work, becau&s;e of the heat, viz.) from twelve till three in the afternoon.</P>
<P>Sund. May 16. We were &s;urprized in the even|ing by my brother ju&s;t come from Frederica. After &s;ome conver&s;ation, we con&s;ulted how the poor people there might be taken care of, during his ab&s;ence. And it was at la&s;t agreed, that Mr. Ingham and I &s;hould take our turns in a&s;&s;i&s;ting them; and the fir&s;t
<PB N="42" REF="029861_0041_0FE2A8C9A7C2ECB0">was allotted me. Accordingly on Tue&s;. 18. I walk|ed to Thunderbolt; whence the next afternoon we &s;et out in a &s;mall boat: in the evening we touched at Skidoway, and had a &s;mall, but attentive congrega|tion, to join with us in evening prayer.</P>
<P>Sat. May 22. About four in the afternoon we en|tered upon Doboy Sound. The wind, which was right a-head, was &s;o high, when we were in the mid|dle of it, and the &s;ea &s;o rough, being driven in at the inlet, that the boat was on the point of &s;inking every moment. But it plea&s;ed God to bring us &s;afe to the other &s;ide in half an hour, and to Frederica the next morning. We had public prayers at nine, at which nineteen per&s;ons were pre&s;ent; and (I think) nine communicants.</P>
<P>Fri. 28. I read the commendatory prayer by Mr. Germain, who lay at the point of death. He had lo&s;t his &s;peech and his &s;en&s;es. His eyes were &s;et, nei|ther had he any di&s;cernable motion, but the heaving of his brea&s;t. While we &s;tood round him, he &s;tretch|ed out his arms, rubbed his head, recovered his &s;ight, &s;peech and under&s;tanding; and immediately &s;ending for the bailiffs, &s;ettled the affairs of his family; and then lay down and died.</P>
<P>At the fir&s;t &s;ervice on Sund. May 30. were only five, at the &s;econd twenty-five. The next day, I made Mr La&s;&s;el's will; who notwith&s;tanding his great weakne&s;s, was quite revived, when any mention was made of death, or of eternity.</P>
<P>Tue&s;. June 1. After praying with him, I was &s;urprized to find one of the mo&s;t controverted que&s;|tions in divinity, di&s;intere&s;ted love, decided at once by a poor old man, without education or learning or any in&s;tructor, but the Spirit of God. I a&s;ked him, what he thought of paradi&s;e (to which he had &s;aid he was going?) He &s;aid, "To be &s;ure, it is a fine
<PB N="43" REF="029861_0042_0FE2A8D0079018A0">place. But I don't mind that. I don't care what place I am in. Let God put me where he will, or do with me what he will, &s;o I may but &s;et forth his honour and glory."</P>
<P>Thur&s;. June 3. Being a&s;cen&s;ion-day, we had the holy communion; but only Mr. Hird's family joined with us in it. One rea&s;on why there were no more, was becau&s;e a few words which a woman had inad|vertently &s;poken, had &s;et almo&s;t all the town in a flame. Alas! How &s;hall a city &s;tand that is thus di|vided again&s;t it&s;elf? Where there is no brotherly love, no meekne&s;s, no for-bearing or forgiving one ano|ther: but envy, malice, revenge, &s;u&s;picion, anger, clamour, bitterne&s;s, evil-&s;peaking, without end! Abun|dant proof that there can be no true love of man, un|le&s;s it be built on the love of God.</P>
<P>Sun. 6. Calling on Mr. La&s;&s;el, and a&s;king how he did, "My departure (&s;aid he) I hope is at hand." I a&s;ked, "Are you troubled at that?" He replied, "O no; to depart and to be with Chri&s;t, is far bet|ter. I de&s;ire no more of this bad world. My hope and my joy and my love is there." The next time I &s;aw him he &s;aid, "I de&s;ire nothing more, than for God to forgive my many and great &s;ins. I would be humble. I would be the humble&s;t creature living. My heart is humble and broken for my &s;ins. Tell me, teach me, what &s;hall I do to plea&s;e God. I would fain do whatever is his will." I &s;aid, "It is his will you &s;hould &s;uffer." He an&s;wered, "Then I <HI>will</HI> &s;uffer. I will gladly &s;uffer whatever plea&s;es him."</P>
<P>Mon. 7. Finding him weaker, I a&s;ked, "Do you &s;till de&s;ire to die?" He &s;aid, "Yes; but I dare not pray for it, for fear I &s;hould di&s;plea&s;e my heaven|ly Father. His will be done. Let him work his will, in my life, or in my death."</P>
<P>Thur&s;. 10. We began to execute at Frederica what we had before agreed to do at Savannah. Our
<PB N="44" REF="029861_0043_0FE2A8D2C2C0F0D8">de&s;ign was on Sundays in the afternoon, and every evening after public &s;ervice, to &s;pend &s;ome time with the mo&s;t &s;erious of the communicants, in &s;inging, reading and conver&s;ation. This evening we had only Mark Hird. But on Sunday Mr. Hird, and two more de&s;ired to be admitted. After a p&s;alm and a little conver&s;ation, I read Mr. Law's <HI>Chri&s;tian Per|fection,</HI> and concluded with another p&s;alm.</P>
<P>Sat. June 12. Being with one who was very de|&s;irous to conver&s;e with me, "but not upon religion," I &s;poke to this effect. "Suppo&s;e you was going to a country, where every one &s;poke Latin and under|&s;tood no other language, neither would conver&s;e with any that did not under&s;tand it: &s;uppo&s;e one was &s;ent to &s;tay here a &s;hort time, on purpo&s;e to teach it you: &s;uppo&s;e that per&s;on, plea&s;ed with your company, &s;hould &s;pend his time in trifling with you, and teach you no|thing of what he came for: would that be well done? Yet this is our ca&s;e. You are going to a county, where every one &s;peaks the love of God. The citi|zens of heaven under&s;tand no other language. They conver&s;e with none who do not under&s;tand it. In|deed none &s;uch are admitted there. I am &s;ent from God to teach you this. A few days are allotted us for that purpo&s;e. Would it then be well done in me, becau&s;e I was plea&s;ed with your company, to &s;pend this &s;hort time in trifling, and teach you nothing of what I came for? God forbid! I will rather not con|ver&s;e with you at all. Of the two extremes, this is the be&s;t."</P>
<P>Wed. June 16. Another little company of us met, Mr. Reed, David&s;on, Walker, Delamotte, and my|&s;elf. We &s;ung, read a little of Mr. Law, and then conver&s;ed. Wedne&s;days and Fridays were the days we fixed for con&s;tant meeting.</P>
<P>Thur&s;. 17. An officer of a man of war, walking ju&s;t behind us, with two or three of his acquaintance,
<PB N="45" REF="029861_0044_0FE2A8D451473BA8">cur&s;ed and &s;wore exceedingly; but upon my reprov|ing him, &s;eemed much moved, and gave me many thanks.</P>
<P>Sat. 19. Mr. Oglethorpe returned from the &s;outh, and gave orders on Sunday the 20th, that none &s;hould profane the day (as was u&s;ual before) by fi&s;hing or fowling upon it. In the afternoon I &s;ummed up what I had &s;een or heard at Frederica, incon&s;i&s;tent with chri&s;tianity, and con&s;equently with the pro&s;perity of the place. The event was as it ought: &s;ome of the hearers were profited, and the re&s;t deeply offended.</P>
<P>This day, at half an hour pa&s;t ten, God heard the prayer of his &s;ervant, and Mr. La&s;&s;el, according to his de&s;ire, was <HI>di&s;&s;olved that he might be with Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Tue&s;. 22. Ob&s;erving much coldne&s;s in Mr.&mdash;'s behaviour, I a&s;ked him the rea&s;on of it. He an|&s;wered, "I like nothing you do; all your &s;ermons are &s;atires upon particular per&s;ons. Therefore I will never hear you more. And all the people are of my mind. For we won't hear our&s;elves abu&s;ed."</P>
<P>"Be&s;ides, they &s;ay, they are pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">te&s;tants. But as for you, they cannot tell what religion you are of. They never heard of &s;uch a religion before. They do not know what to make of it. And then, your private behaviour.&mdash;All the quarrels that have been here &s;ince you came, have been long of you. Indeed there is neither man nor woman in the town, who minds a word you &s;ay. And &s;o you may preach long enough; but nobody will come to hear you."</P>
<P>He was too warm for hearing an an&s;wer. So I had nothing to do, but to thank him for his open|ne&s;s, and walk away.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;. 23. I had a long conver&s;ation with Mr. &mdash;, upon the nature of true religion. I then a&s;ked him, "Why he did not endeavour to recom|mend it to all with whom he conver&s;ed?" He &s;aid, "I did &s;o once; and for &s;ome time, I thought I
<PB N="46" REF="029861_0045_0FE2A8D6A97989D8">had done much good by it. But I afterwards found they were never the better, and I my&s;elf was the wor&s;e. Therefore now, though I always &s;trive to be inoffen&s;ive in my conver&s;ation, I do not &s;trive to make people religious, unle&s;s tho&s;e that have a de&s;ire to be &s;o, and are con&s;equently willing to hear me. But I have not yet (I &s;peak not of you, or your brother) found one &s;uch per&s;on in America."</P>
<P><HI>He that hath ears to hear, let him hear!</HI> Mark the tendency of this accur&s;ed principle! If you will &s;peak only to tho&s;e who are <HI>willing to hear,</HI> &s;ee how many you will turn from the error of their ways! If there|fore, &s;triving to do good, you have done hurt, what then? So did St. Paul. So did the Lord of life. Even HIS word was <HI>the &s;avour of death, as well as the &s;avour of life.</HI> But &s;hall he therefore &s;trive no more? God forbid! Strive more humbly, more calm|ly, more c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tiou&s;ly. Do not &s;trive <HI>as you did before,</HI>&mdash; but &s;trive, while the breath of God is in your noctril<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">!</P>
<P>Being to leave Frederica in the evening, I took the more notice of the&s;e words in the le&s;&s;on for the day. <HI>Whereunto &s;hall I liken the men of this generation? They are like unto children &s;itting in the market-place, and &s;aying, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> have piped unto you, and ye have not danced, we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept. For John the bapti&s;t came neither eating bread, nor drinking wine, and ye &s;ay, He hath a devil. The Son of Man is come eating and drinking, and ye &s;ay, Behold a glutton|ous man and a wine bibber, a friend of Publicans and Sinners.</HI> Luke vii.</P>
<P>About eleven at night we took boat. And on Sat. 26, about one in the afternoon came to Savannah. O what de we want here, either for life or godline&s;s! If &s;uffering, God will &s;end it in <HI>his</HI> time.</P>
<P>Sun. June 27. About twenty joined with us in morning prayer. An hour or two after, a large party of Creek Indians came, the expectation of whom de|prived
<PB N="47" REF="029861_0046_0FE2A8DC6B604750">us of our place of public wor&s;hip, in which they were to have their audience.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;. 30. I hoped a door was opened, for going up immediately to the Choctaws, the lea&s;t po|li&s;hed, <HI>i. e.</HI> the lea&s;t corrupted of all the Indian na|tions. But upon my informing Mr. Oglethorpe of our de&s;ign, he objected, not only the danger of being intercepted, or killed by the French there; but much more, the inexpediency of leaving Savannah de&s;titute of a mini&s;ter. The&s;e objections I related to our brethren in the evening, who were all of opinion, "We ought not to go yet."</P>
<P>Thur&s;. July 1. The Indians had an audience, and another on Saturday, when Chicali, their head-man, dined with Mr. Oglethorpe. After dinner, I a&s;ked the grey-headed old man, "What he thought he was made for?" He &s;aid, "He that is above knows what he made us for. We know nothing. We are in the dark. But white men know much. And yet white men build great hou&s;es, as if they were to live for ever. But white men cannot live for ever. In a little time, white men will be du&s;t as well as I." I told him, "If red men will learn the good book, they may know as much as white men. But neither we nor you can under&s;tand that book, unle&s;s we are taught y him that is above: and he will not teach, unle&s;s you avoid, what you already know is not good." He an&s;wered, "I believe that. He will not teach us, while our hearts are not white. And our men do what they know is not good. They kill their own children. And our women do what they know is not good. They kill the child before it is born. There|fore, he that is above, does not &s;end us the good book."</P>
<P>Hearing the younger of the Mi&s;s Boveys was not well, I called upon them this evening. I found &s;he had only the prickly heat, a &s;ort of ra&s;h, very com|mon
<PB N="48" REF="029861_0047_0FE2A8DF5049A998">here in &s;ummer. We &s;oon fell into &s;erious con|ver&s;ation, after I had a&s;ked, "If they did not think they were too young to trouble them&s;elves with re|ligion yet? And, whether they might not defer it ten or a dozen years?" To which one of them replied, "If it will be rea&s;onable ten years hence, to be reli|gious, it is &s;o now: I am not for deferring one mo|ment."</P>
<P>Wedne&s;. July 7. I called there again, being de|termined now to &s;peak more clo&s;ely. But meeting company there, <HI>prudence</HI> induced me to put it off till another opportunity.</P>
<P>Thur&s;. 8. Mr. O. being there again, and ca&s;ually &s;peaking of &s;udden death, Mi&s;s Becky &s;aid, "If it was the will of God, I &s;hould choo&s;e to die without a lingering illne&s;s." Her &s;i&s;ter &s;aid, "Are you then always prepared to die?" She replied, "Je&s;us Chri&s;t is always prepared to help me. And little &s;tre&s;s is to be laid on &s;uch a preparation for death, as is made in a &s;it of &s;ickne&s;s."</P>
<P>Sat. July 10. Ju&s;t as they had done drinking tea, Mrs. Margaret &s;eeing her colour change, a&s;ked, if &s;he was well? She did not return any an&s;wer; and Dr. Tal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er &s;oon after going by, &s;he de&s;ired him to &s;tep in, and &s;aid, "Sir, my &s;i&s;ter, I fear is not well." He looked earne&s;tly at her, felt her pul&s;e, and repli|ed, "Well, madam! Your &s;i&s;ter is dying." However he thought it not impo&s;&s;ible, bleeding might help. She bled about an ounce, leaned back and died.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I heard of it, I went to the hou&s;e, and begged they would not lay her out immediately, there being a po&s;&s;ibility, at lea&s;t, &s;he might only be in a &s;woon: of which indeed there was &s;ome &s;light hope, &s;he not only being as warm as ever, but having a fre&s;h colour in her cheeks, and a few drops of blood &s;tarting out, upon bending her arm: but there was no pul&s;e and no breath; &s;o that having waited &s;ome
<PB N="49" REF="029861_0048_0FE2A8E0DEB3AA38">hours, we found her <HI>&s;pirit was indeed returned to God who gave it.</HI></P>
<P>I never &s;aw &s;o beautiful a corp&s;e in my life. Poor comfort to its late inhabitant! I was greatly &s;urprized at her &s;i&s;ter. There was in all her behaviour, &s;uch an inexpre&s;&s;ible mixture of tenderne&s;s and re&s;ignation. The fir&s;t time I &s;poke to her, &s;he &s;aid, "All my af|flictions are nothing to this. I have lo&s;t not only a &s;i&s;ter, but a friend. But it is the will of God. I rely on him; and doubt not but he will &s;upport me under it."</P>
<P>This evening we had &s;uch a &s;torm of thunder and lightning, as I never &s;aw before even in Georgia. This voice of God too, told me I was not fit to die; &s;ince I was afraid, rather than de&s;irous of it! O when &s;hall I wi&s;h to be di&s;&s;olved and to be with Chri&s;t! When I love him with all my heart.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t the whole town was the next evening at the funeral: where many doubtle&s;s made a world of good re&s;olutions. O how little trace of mo&s;t of the&s;e will be left in the morning! 'Tis a true &s;aying, "Hell is paved with good intentions."</P>
<P>Tue&s;. July 20. Five of the Chica&s;aw Indians (twenty of whom had been in Savannah &s;everal days) came to &s;ee us, with Mr. Andrews, their interpreter. They were all warriors; four of them head men. The two chiefs were Pau&s;toobee and Mingo Mattaw. Our conference was as follows:</P>
<P>Q. Do you believe, there is one above who is over all things?</P>
<P>Pau&s;toobee an&s;wered, We believe there are four beloved things above, the clouds, the &s;un, the clear &s;ky, and he that lives in the clear &s;ky.</P>
<P>Q. Do you believe, there is but one that lives in the clear &s;ky?</P>
<P>A. We believe, there are two with him, three in all.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="029861_0049_0FE2A8E32D003BB0">
Q. Do you think he made the &s;un, and the other beloved things?</P>
<P>A. We cannot tell. Who hath &s;een?</P>
<P>Q. Do you think he made you?</P>
<P>A. We think he made all men at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Q. How did he make them at fir&s;t?</P>
<P>A. Out of the ground.</P>
<P>Q. Do you believe he loves you?</P>
<P>A. I do not know. I cannot &s;ee him.</P>
<P>Q. But has he not often &s;aved your life?</P>
<P>A. He has. Many bullets have gone on this &s;ide, and many on that &s;ide, but he would never let them hurt me. And many bullets have gone into the&s;e young men; and yet they are alive?</P>
<P>Q. Then, cannot he &s;ave you from your enemies now?</P>
<P>A. Yes, but we know not, if he will. We have now &s;o many enemies round about us, that I think of nothing but death. And if I am to die, I &s;hall die, and I will die like a man. But if he will have me to live I &s;hall live. Though I had ever &s;o many ene|mies, he can de&s;troy them all.</P>
<P>Q. How do you know that?</P>
<P>A. From what I have &s;een. When our enemies came again&s;t us before, then the beloved clouds came for us. And often much rain, and &s;ometimes hail has come upon them, and that in a very hot day. And I &s;aw, when many French and Choctaws and other nations came again&s;t one of our towns. And the ground made a noi&s;e under them, and the beloved ones in the air behind them. And they were afraid, and went away, and left their meat and drink and their guns. I tell no lie. All the&s;e &s;aw it too.</P>
<P>Q. Have you heard &s;uch noi&s;es at other times?</P>
<P>A. Yes, often: before and after almo&s;t every battle.</P>
<P>Q. What &s;ort of noi&s;es were they?</P>
<P>A. Like the noi&s;e of drums and guns and &s;houting.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="029861_0050_0FE2A8EA5AAAEF50">
Q. Have you heard any &s;uch lately?</P>
<P>A. Yes: four days after our la&s;t battle with the French.</P>
<P>Q. Then you heard nothing before it?</P>
<P>A. The night before I dreamed, I heard many drums up there: and many trumpets there, and much &s;tamping of feet and &s;houting. Till then I thought we &s;hould all die. But then I thought the beloved ones were come to help us. And the next day I heard above a hundred guns go off, before the fight began. And I &s;aid, "When the &s;un is there, the beloved ones will help us; and we &s;hall conquer our enemies." And we did &s;o.</P>
<P>Q. Do you often think and talk of the beloved ones?</P>
<P>A. We think of them always, wherever we are. We talk of them and to them, at home and abroad; in peace, in war, before and after we fight; and in|deed whenever and wherever we meet together.</P>
<P>Q. Where do you think your &s;ouls go after death?</P>
<P>A. We believe the &s;ouls of red men walk up and down near the place where they died, or where their bodies lie. For we have often heard cries and noi&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> near the place where any pri&s;oners had been burnt.</P>
<P>Q. Where do the &s;ouls of white men go after death?</P>
<P>A. We cannot tell. We have not &s;een.</P>
<P>Q. Our belief is, that the &s;ouls of bad men only walk up and down; but the &s;ouls of good men go up.</P>
<P>A. I believe &s;o too. But I told you the talk of the nation.</P>
<P>(Mr. Andrews. They &s;aid at the burying, "They knew what you was doing. You was &s;peaking to the beloved ones above, to take up the &s;oul of the young woman.")</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="029861_0051_0FE2A8EBF1D143F0">
Q. We have a book that tells us many things of the beloved ones above, would you be glad to know them?</P>
<P>A. We have no time now, but to fight. If we &s;hould ever be at peace, we &s;hould be glad to know?</P>
<P>Q. Do you expect ever to know what the white men know?</P>
<P>(Mr. Andrews. They told Mr O. They believe the time will come, when the red and white men will be one)</P>
<P>Q. What do the French teach you?</P>
<P>A. The French black

<P>Q. How came your nation by the knowledge they have?</P>
<P>A. As &s;oon as ever the ground was &s;ound, and fit to &s;tand upon, it came to us, and has been with us ever &s;ince. But we are young men. Our old men know more. But all of them do not know. There are but a few; whom the beloved one chu&s;es from a child, and is in them, and takes care of them, and teaches them. They know the&s;e things: and our old men practi&s;e: therefore they know. But I do not practi&s;e. Therefore I know little.</P>
<P>Mond. July 26. My brother and I &s;et out for Charle&s;ton, in order to his embarking for England. But the wind being contrary, we did not reach Port. Royal, 40 miles from Savannah, till Wedne&s;day evening. The next morning we left it. But the wind was &s;o high in the afternoon, as we were cro&s;&s;ing the neck of St. Helena's &s;ound, that our olde&s;t &s;ailor cried out "Now every one mu&s;t take care for him&s;elf." I told him, "God would take care for us all." Almo&s;t as &s;oon as the words were &s;poken, the ma&s;t fell. I kept on the edge of the boat, to be clear of her when &s;he &s;unk (which we expected every moment) though with little pro&s;pect of &s;wimming a&s;hore, again&s;t &s;uch a

But, <HI>How is it that thou had&s;t no faith?</HI> The moment the ma&s;t fell, two men caught it and pulled it into the boat; the other three rowed with all their might, and <HI>God gave command to the wind and &s;eas,</HI> &s;o that in an hour we were &s;afe on land.</P>
<P>Sat. July 31. We came to Charle&s;ton. The church is of brick, but plai&s;tered over like &s;tone. I believe it would contain three or four thou&s;and per|&s;ons. About three hundred were pre&s;ent at the morn|ing &s;ervice the next day (when Mr. Garden de&s;ired me to preach) about fifty at the holy commun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">. I was glad to &s;ee &s;everal negroes at church, one of whom told me, "She was there con&s;tantly; and that her old mi&s;tre&s;s (now dead) had many times in&s;tructed her in the Chri&s;tian religion. I a&s;ked her, "What religion was?" She &s;aid, "She could not tell." I a&s;ked, "If &s;he knew what a &s;oul was?" She an&s;wered, "No." I &s;aid, "Do not you know there is &s;omething in you, different from your body? Something you cannot &s;ee or feel?" She reply'd, "I never heard &s;o much be|fore." I added, "Do you think then, a man dies altogether as a hor&s;e dies?" She &s;aid, "Yes, to be &s;ure." O God, where are thy tender mercies? Are they not over all thy works? When &s;hall the Sun of righteou&s;ne&s;s ari&s;e on the&s;e outca&s;ts of men, with heal|ing in his wings!</P>
<P>Mond. Augu&s;t 2. I &s;et out for the lieutenant governor's &s;eat, about thirty miles from Charle&s;ton, to deliver Mr. Oglethorpe's letters. It &s;tands very plea&s;ant, on a little hill, with a vale on either &s;ide, in one of which is a thick wood; the other is planted with rice and Indian corn. I de&s;igned to have gone back by Mr. Skeene's, who has about fifty Chri&s;tian negroes. But my hor&s;e tiring, I was obliged to re|turn the &s;traight way to Charle&s;ton.</P>
<P>I had &s;ent the boat we came in back to Savannah, expecting a pa&s;&s;age thither my&s;elf in Col. Bull's. His
<PB N="54" REF="029861_0053_0FE2A8F02120B680">not going &s;o &s;oon, I went to A&s;hley-ferry on Thur&s;|day, intending to walk to Port-Royal. But Mr. Belinger not only provided me a hor&s;e, but rode with me him&s;elf ten miles, and &s;ent his &s;on with me to Cumbee-ferry twenty miles farther? whence having hired hor&s;es and a guide, I came to Beaufort (on Port-Royal) the next evening. We took boat in the morning; but the wind being contrary, and very high, did not reach Savannah till Sunday in the afternoon.&mdash; Finding Mr. Oglethorpe was gone, I &s;tayed only a day <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Savannah: and leaving Mr. Ingham and Dela|motte there, &s;et out on Tue&s;day morning for Fre|derica. In walking to Thunderbolt, I was in &s;o heavy a &s;hower, that all my cloaths were as wet as if I had gone through the river. On which occa&s;ion I cannot but ob&s;erve that vulgar error, concerning the hurtful|ne&s;s of the rains and dews of America. I have been throughly wet with the&s;e rains more than once; yet without any harm at all. And I have lain many nights in the open air, and received all the dews that fell. And &s;o I believe might any one, if his con&s;titution was not impaired by the &s;oftne&s;s of a genteel educa|tion.</P>
<P>At Thunderbolt we took boat, and on Friday, Aug, 13. came to Frederica, where I delivered Mr. O. the letters I had brought from Carolina. The next day he &s;et out for Fort St. George. From that time I had le&s;s and le&s;s pro&s;pect of doing good at Fre|derica; many there being extremely zealous, and in|defatigably diligent to prevent it: and few of the re&s;t daring to &s;hew them&s;elves of another mind, for fear of their di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Sat. 28. I &s;et apart (out of the few we had) a few books towards a library at Frederica. In the afternoon I walked to the fort on the other &s;ide of the i&s;land. About five we &s;et out homeward. But my guide not being perfect in the way, we were &s;oon lo&s;t in the
<PB N="55" REF="029861_0054_0FE2A8F6C7390790">woods. We walked on however as well as we could, till between nine and ten, when being heartily tired, and throughly wet with dew, we lay down and &s;lept till morning.</P>
<P>About day-break, on Sunday the 29th, we &s;et out again endeavouring to walk &s;traight forward, and &s;oon after &s;un-ri&s;e found our&s;elves in the Great Savannah near Frederica. By this good providence I was deli|vered from another fear, that of lying in the woods, which experience &s;hewed, was to one in tolerable health a mere <HI>lion in the way.</HI></P>
<P>Thur&s;. Sept. 2. I &s;et out in a &s;loop, and about ten on Sunday morning, came to Skidoway; which (after reading prayers, and preaching to a &s;mall congrega|tion) I left and came to Savannah in the evening.</P>
<P>Mond. 13. I began reading with Mr. Delamotte, bi&s;hop Beveridge's <HI>Pandect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Canonum Conciliorum.</HI>&mdash; Nothing could &s;o effectually have convinced us, that both particular and <HI>general councils may err, and have erred: and that things ordained by them as nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation, have neither &s;trength <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or authority, unle&s;s they be taken out of holy &s;cripture.</HI></P>
<P>Mond. 20. We ended (of which al&s;o I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s. I once thought more highly than I ought to think) the apo&s;tolical canons; &s;o called, as bi&s;hop Beveridge ob&s;erves, <HI>becau&s;e partly grounded upon, partly agreeing with, the traditions delivered down from the apo&s;tles.</HI> But he farther ob&s;erves (in the 159th page of his <HI>Code<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Ga|nonum Eccle&s;iae Primitivae:</HI> and why did he not ob&s;erve it in the fir&s;t page of the book?) <HI>They contain the di&s;cipline u&s;ed in the church at the time when they were collected: not when the council of Nice met; for then many parts of it were u&s;ele&s;s and ob&s;olete.</HI></P>
<P>Tue&s;d. October 12. We con&s;idered if any thing could yet be done, for the poor people of Frederica. And I &s;ubmitted to the judgment of my friends, which was, that I &s;hould take another journey thither:
<PB N="56" REF="029861_0055_0FE2A8F85617B360">Mr. Ingham undertaking to &s;upply my place at Savan|nah, for the time I &s;hould &s;tay there. I came thither on Sat. the 16th, and found few things better than I expected. The morning and evening prayers, which were read for a while after my leaving the place, had been long di&s;continued, and from that time every thing grew wor&s;e and wor&s;e: not many retaining any more of the form than the power of godline&s;s.</P>
<P>I was at fir&s;t a little di&s;couraged, but &s;oon remem|bered the word which cannot fail, <HI>Greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world.</HI> I cried to God to <HI>ari&s;e and maintain his own cau&s;e:</HI> and after the evening prayers were ended, invited a few to my hou&s;e (as I did every night while I &s;tayed at Frederica.) I read to them one of the exhortations of Ephraim Syrus, the the mo&s;t awakening writer (I think) of all the an|cients. We concluded our reading and conver&s;ation with a p&s;alm, and I tru&s;t, our God gave us his ble&s;|&s;ing.</P>
<P>Mond. 18. Finding there were &s;everal Germans at Frederica, who not under&s;tanding the Engli&s;h tongue, could not join in our public &s;ervice, I de&s;ired them to meet me at my hou&s;e; which they did every day at noon from thence forward. We fir&s;t &s;ung a German hymn, then I read a chapter in the New Te&s;tament, then explained it to them as well as I could. After another hymn we concluded with prayer.</P>
<P>Mond. 25. I took boat, and after a flow and dan|gerous pa&s;&s;age, came to Savannah on Sunday the 31&s;t.</P>
<P>Tue&s;. Novem. 23. Mr. Oglethorpe &s;ailed for Eng|land, leaving Mr. Ingham, Mr. Delamotte and me at Savannah, but with le&s;s pro&s;pect of preaching to the Indians, than we had the fir&s;t day we &s;et foot in Ame|rica. Whenever I mentioned it, it was immediately replied, "You cannot leave Savannah without a mi|ni&s;ter." To this indeed my plain an&s;wer was, "I know
<PB N="57" REF="029861_0056_0FE2A8F9E32DB4F0">not that I am under any obligation to the contrary. I never promi&s;ed to &s;tay here one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.

If it was &s;aid, "But did not the tru&s;tees of Georgia appoint you to be mini&s;ter of Savannah?" I replied "They did; h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t it was not done by my &s;olicitation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> it was done without either: my de&s;ire or knowledge. Therefore I cannot conceive that appointment to lay me under any obligation of continuing there, any longer than till a door is opened to the Heathens; and this I expre&s;sly declared, at the time I con&s;ented to accept of that appointment." But though I had no other obligation not to leave Savannah now, yet that of love I could not break through: I could not re&s;i&s;t the importunate reque&s;t of the more &s;erious pari&s;hion|ers, "To watch over their &s;ouls yet a little longer, till &s;ome one came who might &s;upply my place." And this I the more willingly did, becau&s;e the time was not come to preach the go&s;pel of peace to the Hea|thens; all their nations being in a ferment: and Pau|&s;toobee and Mingo Mattaw, having told me, in terms, in my own hou&s;e, "Now our enemies are all about us, we can do nothing but &s;ight: but if the beloved ones &s;hould ever give us to be at peace, then we would hear the <HI>great word.</HI>"</P>

<P>Wed. 23. Mr. Delamotte and I, with a guide, &s;et out to walk to the Cowpens; when we had walked two or three hours, our guide told us plainly, "He did not know where we were." However, believing it could not be far off, we thought it be&s;t to go on. In
<PB N="58" REF="029861_0057_0FE2A8FB734D7FC8">an hour or two we came to a Cypre&s;s Swamp, which lay directly acro&s;s our way: there was not time to walk back to Savannah before night; &s;o we walked through it, the water being about brea&s;t-high. By that time we had gone a mile beyond it, we were out of all path; and it being now pa&s;t &s;un-&s;et, we &s;at down, intending to make a fire, and to &s;tay there till morn|ing; but finding our tinder wet, we were at a &s;tand; I advi&s;ed to walk on &s;till: but my companions being faint and weary, were for lying down, which we ac|cordingly did about &s;ix o'clock: the ground was as wet as our cloaths, which (it being a &s;harp fro&s;t) were &s;oon froze together; however, I &s;lept till &s;ix in the morning. There fell a heavy dew in the night, which covered us over as white as &s;now. Within an hour after &s;un-ri&s;e, we came to a plantation, and in the evening, without any hurt to Savannah.</P>
<P>Tue&s;. 28. We &s;et out by land with a better guide for Frederica. On Wedne&s;day evening we came to Fort-Argyle, on the back of the river Ogeechy. The next afternoon we cro&s;&s;ed Cooanoochy river in a &s;mall cano<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, our hor&s;es &s;wimming by the &s;ide of it. We made a fire on the bank, and notwith&s;tanding the rain, &s;lept quietly till the morning.</P>
<P>Sat. Jan. 1, 1737. Our provi&s;ions fell &s;hort, our journey being longer than we expected: but having a little barbe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d bears-fle&s;h (i. e. dried in the &s;un) we boiled it, and found it whole&s;ome food. The next day we reached <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, the &s;ettlement of the Scotch highlanders, a &s;ober, indu&s;trious, friendly, ho&s;pitable people; who&s;e mini&s;ter, Mr. M^cLeod, is a &s;erious, re&s;olute, and (I hope) a pious man.</P>
<P>On Monday evening we left Darien, and on Wed. 5. came to Frederica. Mo&s;t here were as we expected, cold and heartle&s;s: we found not one who retained his fir&s;t love. O &s;end forth thy light and thy truth, that
<PB N="59" REF="029861_0058_0FE2A902CBA1A170">they may guide them! Let them not yet follow their own imaginations!</P>
<P>After having <HI>beaten the air</HI> in this unhappy place for twenty days, on January 26, I took my final leave of Frederica. It was not any apprehen&s;ion of my own danger (though my life had been threatened many times) but an utter de&s;pair of doing good there, which made me content with the thought of &s;eeing it no more.</P>
<P>In my pa&s;&s;age home, having procured a celebrated book, the works of Nicholas Machiavel, I &s;et my&s;elf carefully to read and con&s;ider it. I began with a prejudice in his favour; having been informed, he had often been mi&s;under&s;tood, and greatly mi&s;repre&s;ented. I weighed the &s;entiments that were le&s;s common; tran&s;cribed the pa&s;&s;ages wherein they were contained; compared one pa&s;&s;age with another, and endeavoured to form a cool, impartial judgment. And my cool judgment is, that if all the other doctrines of devils which have been committed to writing, &s;ince letters were in the world, were collected together in one volume, it would fall &s;hort of this: and, that &s;hould a prince form him&s;elf by this book, &s;o calmly recom|mending hypoeri&s;y, treachery, lying, robbery, op|pre&s;&s;ion, adultery, whoredom and murder of all kinds; Domitian or Nero would be an angel of light, com|pared to that man.</P>
<P>Mon. Jan. 31. We came to Savannah. Tue&s;day Feb. 1. being the anniver&s;ary fea&s;t, on account of the fir&s;t convoy's landing in Georgia, we had a &s;ermon and the holy communion. Thur&s;. 24. It was agreed Mr. Ingham &s;hould go for England, and endeavour to bring over (if it &s;hould plea&s;e God) &s;ome of our friends to &s;trengthen our hands in his work. Sat. 26. He left Savannah.</P>
<P>By Mr. Ingham I writ to Dr. Bray's a&s;&s;ociates, who had &s;ent a parochial library to Savannah. It is
<PB N="60" REF="029861_0059_0FE2A9051491C710">expected of the mini&s;ters who receive the&s;e, to &s;end an account to their benefactors of the method they u&s;e in catechi&s;ing the children, and in&s;tructing the youth of their re&s;pective pari&s;hes. That part of the letter, was as follows:</P>
<P>"Our general method is this: A young gentleman who came with me, teaches between thirty and forty children to read, write, and ca&s;t accounts. Before &s;chool in the morning, and after &s;chool in the after|noon, he catechizes the lowe&s;t cla&s;s, and endeavours to fix &s;omething of what was &s;aid, in their under&s;tand|ings as well as their memories. In the evening he in|&s;tructs the larger children. On Saturday in the after|noon I catechize them all. The &s;ame I do on Sunday before the evening &s;ervice. And in the church, im|mediately after the &s;econd le&s;&s;on, a &s;elect number of them having repeated the catechi&s;m and been examined in &s;ome part of it, I endeavour to explain at large, and to enforce that part, both on them and the congrega|tion.</P>
<P>"Some time after the evening &s;ervice, as many of my pari&s;hioners as de&s;ire it, meet at my hou&s;e (as they do al&s;o on Wedne&s;day evening) and &s;pend about an hour in prayer, &s;inging and mutual exhortation. A &s;maller number (mo&s;tly tho&s;e who de&s;ign to communi|cate the next day) meet here on Saturday evening: and a few of the&s;e come to me on the other evenings, and pa&s;s half an hour in the &s;ame employment."</P>

<P>From the directions I received from God this day, touching an affair of the greate&s;t importance, I could not but ob&s;erve (as I had done many times before) the
<PB N="61" REF="029861_0060_0FE2A906A47363F0">entire mi&s;take of tho&s;e, who a&s;&s;ert, "God will not an&s;wer your prayer, unle&s;s your heart be wholly re|&s;igned to his will." My heart was not wholly re|&s;igned to his will. Therefore, not daring to depend on my own judgment, I cried the more earne&s;tly to him, to &s;upply what was wanting in me. And I know and am a&s;&s;ured, he heard my voice, and did &s;end forth his light and his truth.</P>
<P>Thur&s;. 24. A fire broke out in the hou&s;e of Ro|bert Hows, and in an hour burnt it to the ground. A collection was made for him the next day; and the generality of the people &s;hewed a &s;urprizing will|ingne&s;s, to give a little out of their little, for the re|lief of a nece&s;&s;ity greater than their own.</P>
<P>About this time Mr. L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cy of Thunderbolt called upon me; when ob&s;erving him to be in a deep &s;adne&s;s, I a&s;ked, what was the rea&s;on of it? And a terrible one indeed he gave in the relation following.</P>
<P>In 1733, David Jones, a &s;adler, a middle-aged man, who had for &s;ome time before lived at Notting|ham, being at Bri&s;tol, met a per&s;on there; who after giving him &s;ome account of Georgia, a&s;ked, Whether he would go thither? Adding, his trade (that of a &s;adler) was an exceeding good trade there, upon which he might live creditably and comfortably. He objected his want of money to pay his pa&s;&s;age, and buy &s;ome tools which he &s;hould have need of. The gentleman (Capt. W.) told him, he would &s;upply him with that, and hire him a &s;hop when he came to Georgia, wherein he might follow his bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;o repay him, as it &s;uited his convenience. Accordingly to Georgia they went; where &s;oon after his arrival, his ma&s;ter (as he now &s;tiled him&s;elf) &s;old him to Mr. Lacy, who &s;et him to work with the re&s;t of his &s;er|vants in clearing land. He commonly appeared much more thoughtful than the re&s;t, often &s;tealing into the woods alone. He was now &s;ent to do &s;ome work on
<PB N="62" REF="029861_0061_0FE2A90908682538">an i&s;land, three or four miles from Mr. Lacy's great plantation. Thence he de&s;ired the other &s;ervants to return without him, &s;aying, <HI>He would &s;tay and kill a deer.</HI> This was on Saturday. On Monday they found him on the &s;hore, with his gun by him, and the fore-part of his head &s;hot to pieces. In his pocket was a paper-book, all the leaves thereof were fair, except one, on which ten or twelve ver&s;es were writ|ten; two of which were the&s;e (which I tran&s;cribed thence, from his own hand, writing)

<P>Sun. April 3. And every day in this great and holy week, we had a &s;ermon and the holy communion.</P>
<P>Mon. 4. I began learning Spani&s;h, in order to conver&s;e with my Jewi&s;h Pari&s;hioners: &s;ome of whom &s;eem nearer the mind that was in Chri&s;t, than many of tho&s;e who call him Lord.</P>
<P>Tue&s;. 12. Being determined, if po&s;&s;ible, to put a &s;top to the proceedings of one in Carolina, who had married &s;everal of my pari&s;hioners without either banns or licence, and declared, "He would do &s;o &s;till:" I &s;et out in a &s;loop for Charle&s;ton. I landed there on Thur&s;day, and related the ca&s;e to Mr. Garden, the bi&s;hop of London's commi&s;&s;ary, who a&s;&s;ured me, "he would take care no &s;uch irregularity &s;hould be com|mitted for the future."</P>
<P>Sun. 17. Mr. Garden (to whom I mu&s;t ever ac|knowledge my&s;elf indebted for many kind and gene|rous offices) de&s;iring me to preach, I did &s;o, on tho&s;e words of the epi&s;tle for the day, <HI>What&s;oever is born of God, overcometh the world.</HI> To that plain account of the Chri&s;tian &s;tate which the&s;e words naturally lead me to give, a man of education and character &s;eriou&s;ly objected. (what is indeed a great truth) <HI>"Why if this
<PB N="63" REF="029861_0062_0FE2A90FA39FB0A0">be Chri&s;tianity, a Chri&s;tian mu&s;t have more courage than Alexander the Great."</HI></P>
<P>Tue&s;. 19. We left Charle&s;ton; but meeting with &s;tormy and contrary winds, after lo&s;ing our anchor, and beating out at &s;ea all night, on Thur&s;. 21, we with &s;ome difficulty got back into Charle&s;ton harbour.</P>
<P>Fri. 22. It being the time of their annual vi&s;ita|tion, I had the plea&s;ure of meeting with the clergy of South Carolina: among whom in the afternoon there was &s;uch a conver&s;ation for &s;everal hours, on "Chri&s;t our Righteou&s;ne&s;s," as I had not heard at any vi&s;itation in England, or hardly on any other oc|ca&s;ion.</P>
<P>Sat. 23. Mentioning to Mr. Thomp&s;on, mini&s;ter of St. Bartholomew's, near Ponpon, my being di&s;ap|pointed of a pa&s;&s;age home by water, he offered me one of his hor&s;es, if I would go by land, which I gladly accepted of. He went with me twenty miles, and &s;ent his &s;ervant to guide me the other twenty to his hou&s;e. Finding a young negro there, who &s;eemed more &s;en&s;ible than the re&s;t, I a&s;ked her how long &s;he had been in Carolina? She &s;aid, two or three years; but that &s;he was born in Barbadoes, and had lived there in a mini&s;ter's family from a child. I a&s;ked, Whether &s;he went to church there? She &s;aid, Yes, every Sun|day,&mdash;to carry my mi&s;tre&s;s's children. I a&s;ked what &s;he had learned at church? She &s;aid, <HI>Nothing; I heard a deal; but did not under&s;tand it.</HI> But what did your ma&s;ter teach you at home? <HI>Nothing.</HI> Nor your mi&s;|tre&s;s? <HI>No.</HI> I a&s;ked, "But don't you know, that your hands and feet, and this you call your body, will turn to du&s;t in a little time? She an&s;wered, <HI>Yes.</HI> But there is &s;omething in you that will not turn to du&s;t, and this is what they call your &s;oul. Indeed, you can't &s;ee your &s;oul, though it is within you, as you can't &s;ee the wind, though it is all about you. But if you had not a &s;oul in you, you could no more &s;ee,
<PB N="64" REF="029861_0063_0FE2A911338E1EC0">or hear, or feel, than this table can. What do you think will become of your &s;oul, when your body turns to du&s;t? <HI>I don't know.</HI> Why, it will go out of your body, and go up there, above the &s;ky, and live always. God lives there. Do you know who God is? <HI>No.</HI> You can't &s;ee him, any more than you can &s;ee your own &s;oul. It is he that made you and me, and all men and women, and all bea&s;ts and birds, and all the world. It is he that makes the &s;un &s;hine, and rain fall, and corn and fruits to grow out of the ground. He makes all the&s;e for us. But why do you think he made us? What did he make you and me for? <HI>I can't tell.</HI> He made you to live with him|&s;elf above the &s;ky. And &s;o you will, in a little time,&mdash;if you are good. If you are good, then when your body dies, your &s;oul will go up, and want nothing, and have whatever you can de&s;ire. No one will beat or hurt you there. You will never be &s;ick, You will never be &s;orry any more, nor afraid of any thing. I can't tell you, I don't know how happy you will be: for you will be with God.</P>
<P>The attention with which this poor creature li&s;ten|ed to in&s;truction is inexpre&s;&s;ible. The next day &s;he remembered all, readily an&s;wered every que&s;tion; and &s;aid, <HI>She would a&s;k him that made her, to &s;hew her how to be good.</HI></P>
<P>Sun. 24. I preached twice at Ponpon chapel, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the 13th chapter of the fir&s;t epi&s;tle to the Corinthians. O how will even tho&s;e men of Carolina, who come eight, ten, or twelve miles to hear the go&s;pel, ri&s;e i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> judgment again&s;t tho&s;e who hear it not, when it is preached at their own doors!</P>
<P>Wedne&s;. 27. I came to Mr. Belinger's plantation at Chulifinny, where the rain kept me till Friday. Here I met with an half Indian (one that had an In|dian mother, and a Spani&s;h father) and &s;everal ne|groes, who were very de&s;irous of in&s;truction. One
<PB N="65" REF="029861_0064_0FE2A912C8B3C0B0">of them &s;aid, "When I was at A&s;hley-Ferry, I went to church every Sunday. But here we are buri|ed in the woods. Though if there was any church within five or &s;ix miles, I am &s;o lame I can't walk, but I would orawl thither."</P>
<P>Mr. Belinger &s;ent a negro lad with me to Purry&s;|burg, or rather to the poor remains of it. O how hath God &s;tretched over this place <HI>the lines of confu&s;ion, and the &s;tones of emptine&s;s!</HI> Alas for tho&s;e who&s;e lives were here vilely ca&s;t away, through oppre&s;&s;ion, through divers plagues and troubles! O earth! How long wilt thou hide their blood! How long wilt thou cover thy &s;lain?</P>
<P>This lad too I found both very de&s;irous and very capable of in&s;truction. And perhaps one of the ea&s;ie&s;t and &s;horte&s;t ways to in&s;truct the American negroes in Chri&s;tianity, would be fir&s;t to enquire after and find out &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;erious of the planters. Then having enquired of them, which of their &s;laves <HI>were be&s;t inclined</HI> and under&s;tood Engli&s;h, to go to them from plantation to plantation, &s;taying as long as appear|ed nece&s;&s;ary at each. Three or four gentlemen in Caro|lina I have been with, that would be &s;incerely glad of &s;uch an a&s;&s;i&s;tant; who might pur&s;ue his work with no more hindrance than mu&s;t every where attend the preaching of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Sat. 30. I came to Savannah, and found my little flock in a better &s;tate than I could have expect|ed: God having been plea&s;ed greatly to ble&s;s the endeavours of my fellow-labourer, while I was ab&s;ent from them.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;. May 18. I di&s;covered the fir&s;t convert to dei&s;m that (I believe) has been made here. He was one that for &s;ome time had been zealou&s;ly and ex|emplarily religious. But indulging him&s;elf in <HI>harm|le&s;s</HI> company, he fir&s;t made &s;hipwreck of his zeal, and then of his faith. I have &s;ince found &s;everal others
<PB N="66" REF="029861_0065_0FE2A91456FE98C0">that have been attacked. They have as yet maintain|ed their ground. But I doubt the devil's apo&s;tles are too indu&s;trious to let them long halt between two o|pinions.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;. 25. I was &s;ent for by one who had been &s;everal years of the church of Rome; but was now deeply convinced (as were &s;everal others) by what I had occa&s;ionally preached, of the grievous errors that church is in, and the great danger of continuing a member of it. Upon this occa&s;ion I could not but reflect on the many advices I had received, to beware of the increa&s;e of Popery: but not one (that I re|member) to beware of the increa&s;e of infidelity. This was quite &s;urpri&s;ing, when I con&s;idered, 1. That in every place where I have yet been, the number of the converts to Popery bore no proportion to the number of the converts to infidelity. 2. That as bad a religi|on as Popery is, no religion is &s;till wor&s;e; a baptized infidel being always found upon the trial, two-fold wor&s;e than even a bigotted Papi&s;t. 3. That as dan|gerous a &s;tate as a Papi&s;t is in, with regard to eterni|ty, a Dei&s;t is in a yet more dangerous &s;tate, if he be not (without repentance) an a&s;&s;ured heir of damnati|on. And la&s;tly, That as hard as it is to recover a Papi&s;t, it is &s;till harder to recover an infidel: I my&s;elf having known many Papi&s;ts, but never one Dei&s;t re|converted.</P>
<P>May 29. Being Whit&s;unday, four of our &s;cholars, after having been in&s;tructed daily for &s;everal weeks, were at their earne&s;t and repeated de&s;ire, admitted to the Lord's table. I tru&s;t their zeal hath &s;tirred up many, to remember their Creator in the days of their youth, and to redeem the time, even in the mid&s;t of an evil and adulterous generation.</P>
<P>Indeed about this time we ob&s;erved the Spirit of God to move upon the minds of many of the children. They began more carefully to attend to the things
<PB N="67" REF="029861_0066_0FE2A91BE10815D0">that were &s;poken both at home and at church, and a remarkable &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s appeared in their whole behavi|our and conver&s;ation. Who knows but &s;ome of them may <HI>grow up, to the mea&s;ure of the &s;tature of the fulne&s;s of Chri&s;t?</HI></P>
<P>June 25. Mr. Cau&s;ton (the &s;tore-keeper and chief magi&s;trate of Savannah) was &s;eized with a &s;low fever. I attended him every day (as I did any of my pa|ri&s;hioners, who were in any painful or dangerous ill|ne&s;s) and had a good hope from the thankfulne&s;s he &s;hewed, that my labour was not in vain.</P>
<P>Sun. July 3. Immediately after the holy commu|nion, I mentioned to Mrs. William&s;on (Mr. Cau&s;ton's neice) &s;ome things which I thought reproveable in her behaviour. At this &s;he appeared extremely angry, and &s;aid, <HI>She did not expect &s;uch u&s;age from me;</HI> and at the turn of the &s;treet (through which we were walking home) went abruptly away. The next day Mrs. Cau&s;ton endeavoured to excu&s;e her, told me, She was exceedingly grieved for what had pa&s;&s;ed the day before, and de&s;ired me to tell her in writing what I di&s;liked; which I accordingly did the day following.</P>
<P>But fir&s;t, I &s;ent Mr. Cau&s;ton the following note:

<P>Wedne&s;. 6. Mr. Cau&s;ton came to my hou&s;e, with Mr. Bailiff Parker, and Mr. Recorder; and warmly a&s;ked, "How could you po&s;&s;ibly think I &s;hould con|demn you, for executing any part of your office?" I &s;aid &s;hort, "Sir, what if I &s;hould think it the duty of my office, to repel one of your family from the holy communion?" He replied, "If you repel me or my wife, I &s;hall require a legal rea&s;on. But I &s;hall trou|ble my&s;elf about none el&s;e. Let them look to them|&s;elves."</P>
<P>Sat. 9. Meeting with a Frenchman of New Orleans on the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, who had lived &s;everal months among the Chica&s;aws, he gave us a full and particular account of many things which had been variou&s;ly related. And hence we could not but remark, What is the re|ligion of nature properly &s;o called; or, that religion which flows from natural rea&s;on, una&s;&s;i&s;ted by revela|tion. And that, even in tho&s;e who have the know|ledge of many truths; and who conver&s;e with their beloved ones day and night. But too plainly does it appear by the fruits, <HI>That the gods of the&s;e Heathens to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> are but devils.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;tance of his account was this; Some years pa&s;t the Chica&s;aws and French were friends. The French were then mingled with the Nautchee Indians, whom they u&s;ed as &s;laves; till the Nautchees made a general ri&s;ing, and took many of the French, pri&s;oners. But &s;oon after, a French army &s;et upon them, killed many and carried away the re&s;t. Among tho&s;e that were killed were &s;ome Chica&s;aws, who&s;e death the Chi|ca&s;aw nation re&s;ented; and &s;oon after a French boat was going through their country, they fired into it,
<PB N="69" REF="029861_0068_0FE2A91F09092FC8">and killed all the men but two. The French re&s;olved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n revenge, and orders were given for many Indian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and &s;everal parties of white men, to rendezvous on the 26th of March, 1736, near one of the Chica&s;aw towns. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> party, con&s;i&s;ting of fifty men, came thither &s;ome days before the time. They &s;taid there till the 24th, but none came to join them. On the 25th, they were attacked by two hundred Chica&s;aws. The French attempted to force their way through them. Five or &s;ix and twenty did &s;o; the re&s;t were taken pri&s;oners. The pri&s;oners were &s;ent two or three to a town to be burnt. Only the commanding officer and one or two more were put to death on the place of the engagement."</P>
<P>"I (&s;aid he) and one more, were &s;aved by the warrior who took us. The manner of burning the re&s;t was, holding lighted canes to their arms and legs and &s;everal parts of their bodies for &s;ome time, and then for a while taking them away. They likewi&s;e &s;tuck burning pieces of wood into their fle&s;h all round, in which condition they kept them from morning till evening. But they commonly beat them before they burn them. I &s;aw the prie&s;t that was with us carried to be burnt: and from head to foot, he was as black as your coat with the blows which they had given him."</P>
<P>I a&s;ked him, "What was their manner of life?" He &s;aid, "They do nothing but eat, and drink, and &s;moak, from morning till night, and in a manner from night till morning. For they ri&s;e at any hour of the night when they wake; and after eating and drinking as much as they can, go to &s;leep again." See <HI>The religion of nature</HI> truly <HI>delineated!</HI></P>
<P>Saturday 23. Reflecting on the &s;tate I was now in, I could not but ob&s;erve in a letter to a friend, "How to attain to the being crucified with Chri&s;t, I find not, being in a condition I neither de&s;ired, nor

<P>Wedne&s;. 27. I rejoiced to meet once more with that good &s;oldier of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, Augu&s;t Spangenberg; with whom on Monday, Augu&s;t 1, I began my long intended journey to Ebenezer. In the way I told him, "The calm we had &s;o long enjoyed, was now draw|ing to an end: that I hoped he would &s;hortly &s;ee I was not (as &s;ome had told him) a re&s;pecter of per|&s;ons; but was determined (God being my helper) to behave indifferently to all, rich or poor, friends or ene|mies." I then a&s;ked his advice as to the difficulty I fore&s;aw, and re&s;olved, by God's grace to follow it.</P>
<P>In the evening we came to New Ebenezer, where the poor Saltzburghers are &s;ettled. The indu&s;try of this people is quite &s;urprizing. Their &s;ixty huts are neatly and regularly built; and all the little &s;pots of ground between them, improved to the be&s;t advant|age. One &s;ide of the town, is a field of Indian corn; on the other are the plantations of &s;everal private per|&s;ons: all which together one would &s;carce think it po&s;&s;ible for a handful of people to have done in one year.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;. 3. We returned to Savannah. Sund. 7, I repelled Mrs. William&s;on from the holy communion. And Mond. 8, Mr. Recorder of Savannah, i&s;&s;ued out the warrant following:

On Mond. evening God &s;pake to us in the&s;e words. <HI>Call to remembrance the former days, in which you end<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">red a great fight of afflictions: partly whil&s;t ye were made a gazing-&s;tock, both by reproaches and afflictions, and partly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">il&s;t ye became companions of them that were &s;o u&s;ed.&mdash; Ca&s;t not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompen&s;e of reward, For ye have need of patience, that after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>The evening le&s;&s;on on Tue&s;day, was the 11th of the Hebrews; in reading which I was more particu|larly encouraged by his example, who <HI>cho&s;e rather to &s;uffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the plea&s;ures of &s;in for a &s;ea&s;on: e&s;teeming the reproach of Chri&s;t greater riches than the trea&s;ures of Egypt.</HI></P>
<P>The le&s;&s;on on Wedne&s;day began with the&s;e words, <HI>Wherefore &s;eeing we are compa&s;t about with &s;o great a cloud of witne&s;&s;es, let us lay a&s;ide every weight&mdash;and run with patience the race that is &s;et before us: looking unto Je&s;us the author and &s;ini&s;her of our faith, who for the joy that was &s;et before him, endured the cro&s;s, de&s;pi&s;ing the &s;hame, and is &s;et down at the right hand of the throne of God.</HI></P>
<P>In the Thur&s;day le&s;&s;on were the&s;e comfortable words, <HI>I will never leave thee nor for&s;ake thee. So that we may boldly &s;ay, the Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man &s;hall do unto me.</HI></P>
<P>The words of St. James, read on Friday were, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is the man that endureth temptation:</HI> and tho&s;e on Saturday, <HI>My brethren, Have not the faith of our Lord Je&s;us-Chri&s;t&mdash;with re&s;pect of per&s;ons.</HI></P>
<P>I was only afraid, le&s;t tho&s;e who were weak, &s;hould <HI>be turned out of the way,</HI> at lea&s;t, &s;o far as to for&s;ake
<PB N="74" REF="029861_0073_0FE2A92D0A040A88">the public <HI>a&s;&s;embling of them&s;elves together.</HI> But I fear|ed where no fear was. God took care of this al&s;o. So that on Sunday 14, more were pre&s;ent at the morning prayers, than had been for &s;ome months be|fore. Many of them ob&s;erved tho&s;e words in the fir&s;t le&s;&s;on, <HI>Set Naboth on high among the people; and &s;et two men, &s;ons of Belial, before him, to bear witne&s;s again&s;t him.</HI></P>
<P>Tue&s;. 16. Mrs. William&s;on &s;wore to and &s;igned an affidavit, in&s;inuating much more than it a&s;&s;erted; but a&s;&s;erting, "That Mr. We&s;ley had many times propo&s;ed marriage to her, all which propo&s;als &s;he had rejected." Of this I de&s;ired a copy: Mr. Cau&s;ton replied, "Sir, You may have one from any of the News papers in America."</P>
<P>On Thur&s;day or Friday was delivered out a li&s;t of twenty-&s;ix men, who were to meet as a grand jury, on Monday the 22d. But this li&s;t was called in the next day, and twenty-four names added to it. Of this grand jury (forty-four of whom only met) one was a Frenchman, who did not under&s;tand Engli&s;h, one a papi&s;t, one a profe&s;t Infidel, three Bapti&s;ts, &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen others, Di&s;&s;enters, and &s;everal others who had per&s;onal quarrels again&s;t me, and had openly vowed revenge.</P>
<P>To <HI>this</HI> grand jury, on Monday the 22d, Mr. Cau&s;ton gave a long and earne&s;t charge, <HI>To beware of &s;piritual tyranny, and to oppo&s;e the now, illegal authority which was u&s;urped over their con&s;ciences.</HI> Then Mrs. William&s;on's affidavit was read: after which Mr. Cau&s;ton <HI>delivered to the grand jury,</HI> a paper intitled</P>
<P>"A li&s;t of grievances, <HI>pre&s;ented by</HI> the grand jury for Savannah, this  <GAP DESC="blank">  day of Aug. 1737."</P>
<P>This the majority of the grand jury altered in &s;ome particulars, and on Thur&s;. Sept. 1, delivered
<PB N="75" REF="029861_0074_0FE2A933330D0FB0">it again to the court, under the form of two pre&s;ent|ments, containing ten bills, which were then read to the people.</P>
<P>Herein they a&s;&s;erted, upon oath, "That John We&s;ley, Clerk, <HI>had broken the laws of the realm, con|trary to the peace of our Sovereign Lord the King, his crown and dignity.</HI></P>
<P>"1.|By &s;peaking and writing to Mrs. William&s;on, again&s;t her hu&s;band's con&s;ent:</P>

<P>"10.|By refu&s;ing Jacob Matthews for the &s;ame rea&s;on: and baptizing an Indian trader's child with only two &s;pon&s;ors." (This, I own was wrong; for I ought, at all hazards, to have refu&s;ed baptizing it till he had procured a third.)</P>
<P>Frid. 2. Was the third court, at which I ap|peared, &s;ince my being carried before Mr. P. and the recorder.</P>
<P>I now moved for an immediate hearing on the fir&s;t bill, being the only one of a civil nature: but it was refu&s;ed. I made the &s;ame motion in the afternoon; but was put off till the next court day.</P>
<P>On the next court day I appeared again; as al&s;o at the two courts following: but could not be heard,
<PB N="76" REF="029861_0075_0FE2A936358E28C8"><HI>becau&s;e</HI> (the Judge &s;aid) Mr. William&s;on <HI>was gone out of town.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;en&s;e of the minority of the grand jurors them&s;elves (for they were by no means unanimous) concerning the&s;e pre&s;entments, may appear from the following paper, which they tran&s;mitted to the tru&s;tees.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>To the Honourable the Tru&s;tees for Georgia.</HEAD>
<P>"Whereas two pre&s;entments have been made, the one of Augu&s;t 23, the other of Augu&s;t 31, by the grand jury for the town and county of Savannah in Georgia, again&s;t John We&s;ley, Clerk.</P>
<P>"We who&s;e names are underwritten, being mem|bers of the &s;aid grand jury, do humbly beg leave to &s;ignify our di&s;like of the &s;aid pre&s;entments; being by many and divers circum&s;tances throughly per&s;uaded in our&s;elves, that the whole charge again&s;t Mr. We&s;ley, is an artifice of Mr. Cau&s;ton's, de&s;igned rather to blacken the character of Mr. We&s;ley, than to free the colony from religious tyranny, as he was plea&s;ed in his charge to us to term it. But as the&s;e circum|&s;tances will be too tedious to trouble your honours with, we &s;hall only beg leave to give the rea&s;ons of our di&s;&s;ent from the particular bills.</P>
<P>"With regard to the fir&s;t bill, we do not appre|hend, that Mr. We&s;ley acted again&s;t any law, by writing or &s;peaking to Mrs. William&s;on, &s;ince <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> does not appear</HI> to us, <HI>that</HI> the &s;aid Mr. We&s;ley <HI>has either &s;poke in private, or wrote to the &s;aid Mrs. William|&s;on, &s;ince March</HI> 12 (the day of her marriage,) <HI>ex|cept one letter of July the 5th, which he wrote at the reque&s;t of her uncle, as a pa&s;tor to exhort and reprove her.</HI></P>
<P>"The &s;econd we do not apprehend to be a true bill, becau&s;e we humbly conceive Mr. We&s;ley did not a&s;|&s;ume to him&s;elf any authority contrary to law: for
<PB N="77" REF="029861_0076_0FE2A937CACA40B8">we under&s;tand, <HI>Every per&s;on intending to communicate, &s;hould "&s;ignify his name to the curate, at lea&s;t &s;ome time the day before,"</HI> which Mrs. William&s;on did not do; although Mr. We&s;ley had often in full congregation declared, he did in&s;i&s;t on a compliance with that ru|bric, and <HI>had before repelled divers per&s;ons, for non|compliance therewith.</HI></P>
<P>"The third we do not think a true bill, becau&s;e &s;everal of <HI>us</HI> have been his hearers, when he has de|clared his adherence to the <HI>church of England,</HI> in a &s;tronger manner than by a formal declaration; by ex|plaining and defending the <HI>Apo&s;tles, the Nicene</HI> and the <HI>Athana&s;ian Creeds,</HI> the <HI>Thirty-nine Articles,</HI> the <HI>whole Book of Common-Prayer,</HI> and the <HI>Homilies</HI> of the &s;aid church: and becau&s;e we think a formal declaration is not required, but from tho&s;e who have received in&s;ti|tution and induction.</P>
<P>"The fact alledged in the fourth bill we cannot apprehend to be contrary to any law in being.</P>
<P>"The fifth we do not think a true bill, becau&s;e we conceive Mr. We&s;ley is ju&s;tified by the rubric, viz. <HI>If they</HI> (the parents) <HI>certify that the child is weak, it &s;hall &s;uffice to pour water upon it.</HI>" Intimating (as we humbly &s;uppo&s;e) it &s;hall not &s;uffice, if they do not certify.</P>
<P>"The &s;ixth cannot be a true bill, becau&s;e the &s;aid William Gough, being one of our members, was &s;ur|prized to hear him&s;elf named, without his knowledge or privity; and did publicly declare, <HI>It was no griev|ance to him, becau&s;e the &s;aid John We&s;ley, had given him rea&s;ons with which he was &s;atisfied.</HI></P>
<P>"The &s;eventh we do not apprehend to be a true bill, for Nathaniel Polhill was an Anabapti&s;t, and de|fired in his life-time, that he might not be interred with the office of the <HI>church of England.</HI> And farther, we have good rea&s;on to believe, that Mr. We&s;ley was
<PB N="78" REF="029861_0077_0FE2A93A1FA19090">at Frederica, or on his return thence, <HI>when</HI> Polhill <HI>was buried.</HI></P>
<P>"As to the eighth bill we are in doubt, as not well knowing the meaning of the word <HI>Ordinary.</HI> But for the ninth and tenth, we think Mr. We&s;ley is &s;ufficiently ju&s;tified by the canons of the church; which forbid <HI>any per&s;on to be admitted godfather or god|mother to any child, before the &s;aid per&s;on has received the Holy Communion;</HI> whereas William Aglionby and Ja|cob Matthews, had never certified Mr. We&s;ley that they had received it."</P>
</LETTER>
<P>This was &s;igned by twelve of the grand jurors, of whom three were con&s;tables, and &s;ix more, tything|men: who con&s;equently would have made a majority, had the jury con&s;i&s;ted, as it regularly &s;hould have done, of only fifteen members, viz. the four con&s;tables and eleven tythingmen.</P>
<P>Friday, Sept. 30. Having ended the homilies, I began reading Dr. Rogers's eight &s;ermons to the congregation: hoping they might be a timely anti|dote again&s;t the poi&s;on of infidelity, which was now with great indu&s;try propagated among us.</P>
<P>October the 7th, I con&s;ulted my friends, whether God did not call me, to return to England? The rea&s;on for which I left it had now no force; there being no po&s;&s;ibility as yet of in&s;tructing the Indians: neither had I as yet found or heard of any Indians on the continent of America, who had the lea&s;t de&s;ire of being in&s;tructed. And as to Savannah, having never engaged my&s;elf, either by word or letter, to &s;tay there a day longer than I &s;hould judge convenient, nor ever take charge of the people any otherwi&s;e, than as in my pa&s;&s;age to the Heathens, I looked up|on my&s;elf to be fully di&s;charged therefrom, by the vacating of that de&s;ign. Be&s;ides, there was a pro|bability of doing more &s;ervice to that unhappy peo|ple in England, than I could do in Georgia, by re|pre&s;enting
<PB N="79" REF="029861_0078_0FE2A941AB09CE98">without fear or favour to the tru&s;tees, the real &s;tate the colony was in. After deeply con&s;ider|ing the&s;e things, they were unanimous, <HI>That I ought to go: but not yet.</HI> So I laid the thoughts of it a&s;ide for the pre&s;ent: being per&s;uaded, that when the time was come, God would <HI>make the way plain before my face.</HI></P>
<P>Sat. Oct. 15. Being at Highgate, a village five miles from Savannah, con&s;i&s;ting of (all but one) French families, who, I found, knew but little of the Engli&s;h tongue, I offered to read prayers there in French every Saturday in the afternoon. They em|braced the offer gladly. On Saturday the 22d I read prayers in German likewi&s;e, to the German villagers of Hamp&s;tead: and &s;o continued to do, once a week. We began the &s;ervice (both at Highgate and Hamp|&s;tead) with &s;inging a p&s;alm. Then I read and ex|plained a chapter in the French or German te&s;tament, and concluded with prayers and another p&s;alm.</P>
<P>Sat. Oct. 22. Some of the French of Savannah were pre&s;ent at the prayers at Highgate. The next day I received a me&s;&s;age from them all, "That as I read prayers to the French of Highgate, who were but few, they hoped I would do the &s;ame to tho&s;e of Sa|vannah, where there was a large number who did not under&s;tand Engli&s;h." Sund. 30, I began &s;o to do: and now I had full employment for that holy day. The fir&s;t Engli&s;h prayers la&s;ted from five till half an hour pa&s;t &s;ix. The Italian (which I read to a few Vaudois) began at nine. The &s;econd &s;er|vice for the Engli&s;h (including the &s;ermon and the holy communion) continued from half an hour pa&s;t ten, till about half an hour pa&s;t twelve. The French &s;ervice began at one. At two I catechi&s;ed the chil|dren. About three began the Engli&s;h &s;ervice. After this was ended, I had the happine&s;s of joining with as many as my large&s;t room would hold, in reading,
<PB N="80" REF="029861_0079_0FE2A9433A7B1D78">prayer, and &s;inging prai&s;e. And about &s;ix the &s;ervice of the Moravians, &s;o called, began: at which I was glad to be pre&s;ent, not as a teacher, but a learner.</P>
<P>Thur&s;. Nov. 3. I appeared again, at the court holden on that day: and again, at the court held Tue&s;day, Nov. 22. On which day Mr. Cau&s;ton de|&s;ired to &s;peak with me. He then read me &s;ome af|fidavits which had been made, Sept. 15, la&s;t pa&s;t: in one of which it was affirmed, "That I then abu&s;|ed Mr. Cau&s;ton in his own hou&s;e, calling him liar, villain, and &s;o on." It was now likewi&s;e repeated before &s;everal per&s;ons (which indeed I had forgot) "That I had been reprimanded at the la&s;t court, for an enemy to, and hinderer of, the public peace."</P>
<P>I again con&s;ulted my friends, who agreed with me, that the time we looked for was now come. And the next morning calling on Mr. Cau&s;ton, I told him, "I de&s;igned to &s;et out for England immediate|ly." I &s;et up an adverti&s;ement in the Great-&s;quare to the &s;ame effect, and quietly prepared for my journey.</P>
<P>Fri. Dec. 2. I propo&s;ed to &s;et out for Carolina about noon, the tide then &s;erving. But about ten the magi&s;trates &s;ent for me, and told me, "I mu&s;t not go out of the province; for I had not an&s;wered the allegations laid again&s;t me." I replied, <HI>I have ap|peared at &s;ix or &s;even courts &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, in order to an|&s;wer them. But I was not &s;uffered &s;o to do, when I de&s;ired it time after time.</HI> Then they &s;aid, "However, I mu&s;t not go, unle&s;s I would give &s;ecurity to an&s;wer tho&s;e allegations at their court." I a&s;ked, "What &s;ecurity?" After con&s;ulting together about two hours, the Recorder &s;hewed me a kind of bond, en|gaging me under a penalty of fifty pounds, to appear at their court when I &s;hould be required. He added, <HI>But Mr. William&s;on too has de&s;ired of us, that you &s;hould give bail to an&s;wer his action.</HI> I then told him plainly,
<PB N="81" REF="029861_0080_0FE2A944CFF24298"><HI>Sir, you u&s;e me very ill, and &s;o you do the tru&s;tees. I will give neither any bond, nor any bail at all. You know your bu&s;ine&s;s, and I know mine.</HI></P>
<P>In the afternoon the magi&s;trates publi&s;hed an order, requiring all the officers and centinels, to prevent my going out of the province; and forbidding any per|&s;on &s;o to do. Being now only a pri&s;oner at large, in a place where I knew by experience, every day would give fre&s;h opportunity, to procure evidence of words I never &s;aid, and actions I never did; I &s;aw clearly the hour was come for leaving this place: and as &s;oon as evening prayers were over, about eight o'clock, the tide then &s;erving, I &s;hook off the du&s;t of my feet, and left Georgia, after having preached the go&s;|pel there (not as I ought, but as I was able) one year, and nearly nine months.</P>
<P>During this time I had frequent opportunities of making many ob&s;ervations and enquiries, concerning the real &s;tate of thie province (which has been &s;o variou&s;ly repre&s;ented) the Engli&s;h &s;ettlements therein, and the Indians that have intercour&s;e with them. The&s;e I minuted down from time to time; a &s;mall extract of which I have &s;ubjoined.</P>
<P N="1">1. Georgia lies in the 30th and 31&s;t degree of north latitude. The air is generally clear, the rains being much &s;horter, as well as heavier, than in Eng|land. The dews are very great. Thunder and light|ning are expected almo&s;t every day, in May, June, July, and Augu&s;t. They are very terrible, e&s;pecially to a &s;tranger. During tho&s;e months, from ten in the morning to four in the afternoon, the &s;un is extremely &s;corching. But the &s;ea-breeze generally blows, from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en till three or four. The winter is nearly of the &s;ame length as in England. But the mid-day &s;un is always warm, even when the mornings and evenings are very &s;harp, and the nights piercing cold.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="82" REF="029861_0081_0FE2A9465C5111B8">
2. The land is of four &s;orts, pine-barren, oak-land, &s;wamp and mar&s;h. The pine-land is of far the great|e&s;t extent, e&s;pecially near the &s;ea-coa&s;ts. The &s;oil of this is a dry, whiti&s;h &s;and, producing &s;hrubs of &s;eve|ral &s;orts, and between them a &s;piry, coar&s;e gra&s;s, which cattle do not love to feed on. But here and there is a little of a better kind, e&s;pecially in the &s;a|vannahs (&s;o they call the low, watry meadows, which are u&s;ually intermixed with pine-lands). It bears na|turally two &s;orts of fruit, wortle-berries (much like tho&s;e in England) and Chincopin-nuts; a dry, har&s;h nut, about the &s;ize of a &s;mall acorn. A laborious man may in one year clear and plant four or five acres of this land: it will produce the fir&s;t year, from two to four bu&s;hels of Indian corn, and from four to eight of Indian pea&s;e <HI>per</HI> acre. The &s;econd year it u&s;ual|ly bears half as much; the third, le&s;s; the fourth, nothing.</P>
<P N="3">3. Vines, mulberries and peach-trees it bears well. The white mulberry is not good to eat. The black is about the &s;ize of a black-berry, and has much the &s;ame flavour. In fre&s;h pine-land, Indian potatoes grow well (which are more lu&s;cious and larger than the Iri&s;h). And &s;o do water-melons and &s;ewee-beans, about the &s;ize of our &s;carlet, but to be &s;helled and eaten like Wind&s;or beans.</P>
<P N="4">4. Oak-land commonly lies in narrow &s;treaks be|tween pine-land and &s;ome &s;wamp, creek or river. The &s;oil is a blacki&s;h &s;and, producing &s;everal kinds of oak (though none exactly like the Engli&s;h) bay, laurel, a&s;h, walnut, &s;umac-trees, gum-trees (a fort of &s;ycamore) dog-trees (covered in &s;pring with large white flowers) and many hickory-trees, which bear a bad <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd of walnut. In the moi&s;te&s;t part of this land &s;ome par&s;immon-trees grew (which bear a &s;ort of yellow, clear, lu&s;cious plumb) and a few mulberry and cherry-trees. The common wild grapes are of
<PB N="83" REF="029861_0082_0FE2A94E51E6A828">two &s;orts, both red: the fox-grape grows two or three only on a &s;talk, is thick-&s;kinned, large-&s;toned, of a har&s;h ta&s;te, and of the &s;ize of a &s;mall Kenti&s;h cherry. The clu&s;ter-grape is of a har&s;h ta&s;te too, and about the &s;ize of a white currant.</P>
<P N="5">5. This land requires much labour to clear; but when it is cleared, it will bear any grain, for three, four, or &s;ometimes five years, without laying any manure upon it. An acre of it generally bears ten bu&s;hels of Indian corn, be&s;ides five of pea&s;e, in a year. So that this at pre&s;ent is ju&s;tly e&s;teemed the mo&s;t valuable land in the province.</P>
<P N="6">6. A &s;wamp is, any low, watry place, which is covered with trees or canes. They are here of three &s;orts, cypre&s;s, river and cane &s;wamps. Cypre&s;s &s;wamps are, mo&s;tly, large ponds, in and round which cypre&s;&s;es grow. Mo&s;t river-&s;wamps are overflown every tide, by the river which runs through or near them. If they were drained, they would produce good rice; as would the cane-&s;wamps al&s;o; which in the mean time are the be&s;t feeding for all &s;orts of cattle.</P>
<P N="7">7. The mar&s;hes are of two &s;orts: &s;oft mar&s;h, which is all a quagmire, and ab&s;olutely good for nothing: and hard-mar&s;h, which is a firm, but barren &s;and, bearing only &s;ower ru&s;hes. Mar&s;hes of both &s;orts abound on the &s;ea i&s;lands, which are very numerous and contain all &s;orts of land. And upon the&s;e chief|ly, near creeks and runs of water, juniper-trees and cedars grow.</P>
<P N="8">8. Savannah &s;tands on a flat <HI>bluff</HI> (&s;o they term any high-land hanging over a creek or river) which ri&s;es forty-five feet perpendicular from the river, and commands it &s;everal miles both upward and downward. The &s;oil is a white &s;and for above a mile in breadth, &s;outh-ea&s;t and north-we&s;t. Beyond this, ea&s;tward, is a river-&s;wamp; we&s;tward a &s;mall wood, in which was the old Indian town. On the other &s;ide of the river
<PB N="84" REF="029861_0083_0FE2A94FE3226A50">is a mar&s;hy i&s;land, covered with large trees. South|we&s;t of the town is a large pine-barren, which ex|tends backward to a branch of the Altamahaw river.</P>
<P N="9">9. St. Simon's i&s;land, having on the &s;outh-ca&s;t the gulph of Florida; on the other &s;ides, branches of the Altamahaw, is about one hundred miles &s;outh of Savannah, and extends in length about twenty, in breadth from two to five miles. On the we&s;t &s;ide of it, on a low bluff, &s;tands Frederica, having woods to the north and &s;outh; to the ea&s;t, partly woods, partly &s;avannahs, and partly mar&s;hes. The &s;oil is mo&s;tly a blacki&s;h &s;and. There is not much pine-land on the i&s;land; the greate&s;t part being oak-land, intermixed with many &s;avannahs, and old Spani&s;h or Indian fields.</P>
<P N="10">10. On the &s;ea-point, about five miles &s;outh-ea&s;t of the town, is the fort where the &s;oldiers are &s;tation|ed. But the &s;torehou&s;e in Frederica better de&s;erves that name; being encompa&s;&s;ed with regular ramparts of earth, and a pali&s;aded ditch, and mounted with can|non, which intirely command the river.</P>
<P N="11">11. About twenty miles north-we&s;t from St. Si|mon's is Darien, the &s;ettlement of the Scotch High|landers, a mile from Fort King George, which was built about &s;eventeen and abandoned about eleven years &s;ince. The town lies on the main-land, clo&s;e to a branch of the Altamahaw, on a bluff about thirty feet above the river, having woods on all &s;ides. The &s;oil is a blacki&s;h &s;and. They built at fir&s;t many &s;cat|tered huts; but la&s;t &s;pring (1736) expecting the Spaniards, they built them&s;elves a large fort, and all retired within the walls of it.</P>
<P N="12">12. Augu&s;ta, di&s;tant from Savannah one hundred and fifty miles, and five from old Savannah Town, is de&s;igned to &s;tand in an old Indian field, on a bluff, about thirty feet high. A &s;mall fort of wooden piles was built there in 1737; but no hou&s;e was then built,
<PB N="85" REF="029861_0084_0FE2A9517174F708">nor any more ground cleared, than Mr. Lacy and his men found &s;o.</P>
<P N="13">13. Old Ebenezer, where the Saltzburghers &s;ettled at fir&s;t, lies twenty-five miles we&s;t of Savannah. A &s;mall creek runs by the town, down to the river, and many brooks run between the little hills: but the &s;oil is a hungry, barren &s;and; and upon any &s;udden &s;how|er, the brooks ri&s;e &s;everal feet perpendicular, and over|flow whatever is near them. Since the Saltzburghers removed, two Engli&s;h families have been placed there: but the&s;e too &s;ay, <HI>That the land is good for nothing; and that the creek is of little u&s;e: it being by water twen|ty miles to the river; and the water generally &s;o low in &s;ummer-time, that a boat cannot come within &s;ix or &s;even miles of the town.</HI></P>
<P N="14">14. New Ebenezer, to which the Saltzburghers re|moved, in March 1736, lies &s;ix miles ea&s;tward from the old, on a high bluff, near the Savannah river. Here are &s;ome tracts of fruitful land, though the greate&s;t part of that adjoining to the town, is pine|barren. The huts, &s;ixty in number, are neatly and regularly built; the little piece of ground allotted to each for a garden, is every where put to the be&s;t u&s;e, no &s;pot being left unplanted. Nay, even one of the main &s;treets, being one more than was as yet want|ed, bore them this year a crop of Indian corn.</P>
<P N="15">15. About ten miles ea&s;t of this, on a creek, three miles from the river, was the village of Abercorn. Ten families &s;ettled here in 1733; but it is now without inhabitants. Four miles below the mouth of Abercorn-creek in Jo&s;eph's-town, is the &s;ettlement of two Scotch gentlemen. A mile below was Sir Francis Bathur&s;t's plantation. And a quarter of a mile from this, Walter Augu&s;tine's &s;ettlement. But both the&s;e are left without inhabitant.</P>
<P N="16">16. A mile below this is Capt. Williams's plan|tation: a mile from thence, Mrs. Matthews's, (late
<PB N="86" REF="029861_0085_0FE2A95303BF5DA8">Mu&s;grove) commonly known by the name of the Cowpens: adjoining to which is the land belonging &s;o Capt. Wat&s;on; on which is an unfini&s;hed hou&s;e, &s;wiftly running to ruin. A mile from this is Irene, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;e built for an Indian &s;chool, in the year 1736. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;tands on a &s;mall, round hill, in a little piece of fruitful ground, given by the Indians to Mr. Ingham. The Indian town is within a furlong of it.</P>
<P N="17">17. Five miles &s;outh-we&s;t of Savannah, on a &s;mall ri&s;e, &s;tands the village of Highgate. It has pine|land on three &s;ides, and a &s;wamp on the fourth. Twelve families were placed here in 1733; nine whereof remain there. A mile ea&s;tward of this is Hamp&s;tead, &s;ettled with twelve families al&s;o, a little before Highgate; five of which are &s;till remain|ing.</P>
<P N="18">18. Six miles &s;outh-ea&s;t of Savannah is Thunder|bolt. Three families are &s;ettled here, near a &s;mall, ruinous fort: four miles &s;outh of this is the i&s;land of Skidoway: on the north-ea&s;t point whereof ten fami|lies were placed in 1734; (a &s;mall fort was built here likewi&s;e) but nine of them are either dead, or removed to other places. A &s;mall creek divides Skidoway from Tybee i&s;land, on the &s;outh-ea&s;t part of which, fronting the inlet, the light-hou&s;e is built. Ten families were &s;ettled here in 1734; but they are part dead, and part removed, &s;o that the i&s;land is now again without any fixed inhabitant.</P>
<P N="19">19. Twelve miles &s;outhward from Savannah (by land) is Mr. Hou&s;toun's plantation: and forty or fifty miles from him, up Ogeechy river, that where Mr. Sterling for &s;ome time lived. Fort Argyle &s;tands twenty miles from this, on a high bluff, by the river Ogeechy. It is a &s;mall, &s;quare, wooden fort, mu&s;ket|proof. Ten freeholders were &s;ettled near it; but eight of them are gone, and the land they had clear|ed
<PB N="87" REF="029861_0086_0FE2A95AF51D9860">lying wa&s;te, will in a few years be as it was be|fore.</P>
<P N="20">20. The &s;outhernmo&s;t &s;ettlement in Georgia, is Fort St. Andrew. It &s;tands fifty miles &s;outh of Fre|derica, on the &s;outh-we&s;t &s;ide of Cumberland-i&s;land, upon a high neck of land, which commands the river both ways. The walls are of wood, filled up with earth, round which are a ditch and pali&s;ade.</P>
<P N="21">21. It is hard to pick out any con&s;i&s;tent account of the Georgian Indians, from the contradictory relations of their traders. The following is extracted, partly from tho&s;e wherein all, or the generality of them agree; partly from the relations of &s;uch as have been occa&s;ion|ally among&s;t them, and have no intere&s;t in making them better or wor&s;e than they are.</P>
<P N="22">22. Of the Georgian Indians in general it may be ob&s;erved, That they are not &s;o properly nations, as tribes or clans, who have wandered thither at differ|ent times; perhaps expelled their native countries by &s;tronger tribes; but how or when they cannot tell, being none of them able to give any rational account of them&s;elves. They are inured to hard&s;hips of all kinds, and &s;urpri&s;ingly patient of pain. But as they have no letters, &s;o they have no religion, no laws, no civil government. Nor have they any kings or princes, properly &s;peaking; their Meekos or head-men, hav|ing no power either to command or puni&s;h, no man obeying them any farther than he plea&s;es. So that every one doth what is right in his own eyes; and if it appears wrong to his neighbour, the per&s;on aggriev|ed u&s;ually &s;teals on the other unawares, and &s;hoots him, &s;calps him, or cuts off his ears: having only two &s;hort rules of proceeding, to do what be will, and what he can.</P>
<P N="23">23. They are likewi&s;e all, except (perhaps) the Choctaws, gluttons, drunkards, thieves, di&s;&s;emblers,
<PB N="88" REF="029861_0087_0FE2A95CC71CF7F8">liars. They are implacable, unmerciful: murderers of fathers, murderers of mothers, murderers of their own children: it being a common thing for a &s;on to &s;hoot his father or mother, becau&s;e they are old and pa&s;t labour; and for a woman either to procure abor|tion, or to throw her child into the next river, be|cau&s;e &s;he will go with her hu&s;band to the war. In|deed hu&s;bands, &s;trictly &s;peaking, they have none: for any man leaves his wife (&s;o called) at plea&s;ure, who, frequently, in return, cuts the throats of all the children &s;he has had by him. Whoredom they account no crime, and few in&s;tances appear of a young In|dian woman's refu&s;ing any one. Nor have they any fixed puni&s;hment for adultery; only, if the hu&s;band take his wife with another man, he will do what he can to both, unle&s;s &s;peedily pacified by the pre&s;ent of a gun or a blanket.</P>
<P N="24">24. The Choctaws only have &s;ome appearance of an entire nation, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a large extent of land, eight or nine hundred miles we&s;t of Savannah, and many well inhabited towns. They are &s;aid to have &s;ix thou|&s;and fighting men, united under one head. At pre|&s;ent they are in league with the French, who have &s;ent &s;ome prie&s;ts among them; by whom (if one may credit the Choctaw traders) ten or twelve have been baptized.</P>
<P N="25">25. Next to the&s;e, to the north-ea&s;t, are the Chi|ca&s;aws: Their country is flat, full of meadows, &s;prings and rivers. In their fields, though &s;ix <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;even hundred miles from the &s;ea, are found &s;ea-&s;he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> in great numbers. They have about nine hundred fighting men, ten towns, and one Meeko (at lea&s;t) in every one. They are eminently gluttons, eating, drinking, and &s;moaking all day, and almo&s;t all night. They are extreme indolent and lazy, except in war<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> then they are the mo&s;t indefatigable, and the mo&s;t valiant of all the Indians; but they are equally cruel
<PB N="89" REF="029861_0088_0FE2A91D7370DE78">with the re&s;t, torturing and burning all their pri&s;oners, whether Indian or European.</P>
<P N="26">26. Ea&s;t of them, in the latitude of 35 and 36, about three or four hundred miles from Savannah, lie the Cherokees. Their country is very mountainous, fruitful, and plea&s;ant. They have fifty-two towns, and above three thou&s;and fighting men. In each town are three or more head-men, who keep up a &s;ort of &s;hadow of government, having power to &s;et the re&s;t to work, and to puni&s;h &s;uch as will not join in the common labour. They are civil to &s;trangers, and will do any thing for them, <HI>for pay;</HI> being always willing, for a &s;mall piece of money, to carry a me&s;|&s;age for fifty or &s;ixty miles, and, if required, a heavy burthen too: but they are equally cruel to pri&s;oners with the Chica&s;aws, though not equally valiant. They are &s;eldom intemperate in drinking, but when they can be &s;o on free-co&s;t. Otherwi&s;e, love of drink yields to covetou&s;ne&s;s: a vice &s;carcely to be found in any Indian but a Cherokee.</P>
<P N="27">27. The Uchees have only one &s;mall town left (near two hundred miles from Savannah) and about forty fighting men. The Creeks have been many times on the point of cutting them off. They are indeed hated by mo&s;t, and de&s;pi&s;ed by all the other nations, as well for their cowardice, as their &s;uperlative diligence in thieving, and for out-lying all the Indians upon the continent.</P>
<P N="28">28. The Creek Indians are about four hundred miles from Savannah. They are &s;aid to be bounded on the we&s;t by the Choctaws, to the north by the Chica&s;aws, to the ea&s;t by the Cherokees, and to the &s;outh by the Alatamahaw river. They have many towns, a plain, well-watered country, and fifteen hundred &s;ighting men. They have often three or four Meekos in a town; but without &s;o much as the &s;hadow of authority, only to give advice, which every one is at
<PB N="90" REF="029861_0089_0FE2A960A17C9220">liberty to take or leave. But age and reputation for valour and wi&s;dom, have given Chicali, a Meeko of the Coweta-town, a more than ordinary influence over the nation; though not even the &s;hew of regal power. Yet neither age, wi&s;dom nor reputation can re&s;train him from drunkenne&s;s. Indeed all the Creeks, hav|ing been mo&s;t conver&s;ant with white men, are mo&s;t in|fected with an in&s;atiate love of drink, as well as many other European vices, They are more exqui&s;ite di&s;|&s;emblers than the re&s;t of their countrymen. They know not what friend&s;hip or gratitude means. They &s;hew no inclination to learn any thing; but lea&s;t of all, Chri&s;tianity; being full as opiniated of their own parts and wi&s;dom, as either the modern Chine&s;e, or ancient Romans.</P>
<P>Sat. Dec. 3. We came to Purry&s;burg early in the morning, and endeavoured to procure a guide to Port-Royal. But none being to be had, we &s;et out with|out one, an hour before &s;un-ri&s;e. After walking two or three hours, we met with an old man, who led us into a &s;mall path, near which was a line of <HI>blazed</HI> trees, (i. e. marked by cutting off part of the bark) by fol|lowing which, he &s;aid, we might ea&s;ily come to Port-Royal in five or &s;ix hours.</P>
<P>We were four in all; one of whom intended to go to England with me; the other two to &s;ettle in Caro|lina. About eleven we came into a large &s;wamp, where we wandered about till near two. We then found another <HI>blaze,</HI> and pur&s;ued it, till it divided into two; one of the&s;e we followed through an almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able thicket, a mile beyond which it ended. We made through the thicket again, and traced the other <HI>blaze</HI> till that ended too. It now grew toward &s;un-&s;et, &s;o we &s;at down, faint and weary, having had no food all day, except a ginger-bread cake, which I had taken in my pocket. A third of this we had divided among us at noon; another third we took
<PB N="91" REF="029861_0090_0FE2A9660EE79128">now; the re&s;t we re&s;erved for the morning; but we had met with no water all the day. Thru&s;ting a &s;tick into the ground, and finding the end of it moi&s;t, two of our company fell a digging with their hands, and at about three feet depth, found water. We thanked God, drank, and were refre&s;hed. The night was &s;harp; however, there was no complaining among us; but after having commended our&s;elves to God, we lay down clo&s;e together, and (I at lea&s;t) &s;lept till near &s;ix in the morning.</P>
<P>Sun. Dec. 24. God renewing our &s;trength, we aro&s;e neither faint nor weary, and re&s;olved to make one trial more, to find out a path to Port-Royal. We &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ed due ea&s;t; but finding neither path nor blaze, and the woods growing thicker and thicker, we judged it would be our be&s;t cour&s;e to return, if we could, by the way we came. The day before, in the thicke&s;t part of the woods, I had broke many young trees, I knew not why, as we walked along: the&s;e we found a great help in &s;everal places, where no path was to be &s;een; and between one and two God brought us &s;afe to Benjamin Arieu's hou&s;e, the old man we left the day before.</P>
<P>In the evening I read French prayers to a numerous family, a mile from Mr. Arieu's; one of whom un|dertook to guide us to Port-Royal. In the morning we &s;et out. About &s;un-&s;et, we a&s;ked our guide, if he knew where he was? Who frankly an&s;wered, No. However, we pu&s;hed on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">till about &s;even when we came to a plantation, and the next evening (after many difficulties and delays) we landed on Port-Royal i&s;land.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;. 7. We walked to Beaufort; where Mr. Jones (the mini&s;ter of Beaufort) with whom I lodged during my &s;hort &s;tay here, gave me a lively idea of the old Engli&s;h ho&s;pitality. On Thur&s;. Mr. Delamotte came; with whom, on Friday the 9th, I took boat
<PB N="92" REF="029861_0091_0FE2A9685C0CE498">for Charle&s;ton. After a &s;low pa&s;&s;age by rea&s;on of contrary winds, and &s;ome conflict (our provi&s;ions fall|ing &s;hort) with hunger as well as cold, we came thither early in the morning, on Tue&s;day the 13th. Here I expected trials of a different kind, and far more dangerous. For contempt and want are ea&s;y to be borne: but who can bear re&s;pect and abundance?</P>
<P>Wedne&s;. 14. Being de&s;ired to read public prayers, I was much refre&s;hed with tho&s;e glorious promi&s;es, contained both in the 72d P&s;alm, and in the fir&s;t le&s;&s;on, the 40th chapter of I&s;aiah. Yea, <HI>they that wait upon the Lord &s;hall renew their &s;trength, and mount up with wing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> as eagles<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> they &s;hall run and not be weary; they &s;hall walk and not &s;aint.</HI></P>
<P>In the afternoon vi&s;iting a dying man, we found him &s;till full of the fre&s;he&s;t advices, and bu&s;y in &s;ettling the affairs of the C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arina, Prince Thamas, and the Ottoman Porte. How natural then is the thought
<Q><L>&mdash;<HI>Quae cura nitentis</HI></L>
<L><HI>Pa&s;cere equos, endem &s;equitur tellure repo&s;tos?</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>For if a &s;oul quivering on the verge of life, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;till lei&s;ure for the&s;e impertinencies, one might almo&s;t believe the &s;ame dreams would continue even in the &s;leep of death!</P>
<P>Friday, 16. I parted from the la&s;t of tho&s;e friends, who came with me into America, Mr. Charles Dela|motte, from whom I had been but a few days &s;epa|rate, &s;ince Oct. 14, 1735.</P>
<P>Sun. 18. I was &s;eized with a violent flux, which I felt came not before I wanted it. Yet I had &s;trength enough given to preach once more to this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> people: and a few <HI>believed our report.</HI></P>
<P>Thur&s;. 22. I took my leave of America (though if it plea&s;e God not for ever) going on board the Samuel, Captain P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rcy, with a young gentleman who
<PB N="93" REF="029861_0092_0FE2A969E9789F78">had been a few months in Carolina, one of my pa|ri&s;hioners of Savannah, and a Frenchman, late of Parry&s;burg, who was e&s;caped thence with the &s;kin of his teeth.</P>
<P>Sat. 24. We &s;ailed over Charle&s;ton bar, and about noon lo&s;t &s;ight of land.</P>
<P>The next day the wind was fair, but high, as it was on Sunday 25, when the &s;ea affected me more than it had done in the &s;ixteen weeks of our pa&s;&s;age to America. I was obliged to lie down the greate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> part of the day, being ea&s;y only in that po&s;ture.</P>
<P>Mon. 26. I began in&s;tructing a negro-lad in the principles of Chri&s;tianity. The next day I re&s;olved to break off living delicately, and return to my old &s;implicity of diet: and after I did &s;o, neither my &s;tomach nor my head much complained of the mo|tion of the &s;hip.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;. 28. Finding the unaccountable appre|hen&s;ions of I know not what danger (the wind being &s;mall, and the &s;ea &s;mooth) which had been upon me &s;everal days, increa&s;e; I cried earne&s;tly for help; and it plea&s;ed God as in a moment to re&s;tore peace to my &s;oul.</P>
<P>Let me ob&s;erve hereon, 1. That not one of the&s;e hours ought to pa&s;s out of my remembrance, till I attain another manner of &s;pirit, a &s;pirit equally willing to glorify God by life or by death. 2. That whoever is unea&s;y on any account (bodily pain alone except|ed) carries in him&s;elf his own conviction, that he is &s;o far an unbeliever. Is he unea&s;y at the apprehen|&s;ion of death? Then he believeth not, That <HI>to die is gain.</HI> At any of the events of life, then he hath not a firm belief, That <HI>all things work together for</HI> his <HI>good.</HI> And if he bring the matter clo&s;e, he will always find, be&s;ide the general want of faith, every particular un|ea&s;ine&s;s is evidently owing to the want of &s;ome par|ticular Chri&s;tian temper.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="029861_0093_0FE2A96B75FBEA70">
Sun. Jan. 1, 1738. All in the &s;hip (except the Cap|tain and &s;teer&s;man) were pre&s;ent both at the morning and evening &s;ervice, and appeared as deeply attentive, as even the poor people of Frederica did, while the word of God was new to their ears. And it may be, one or two among the&s;e likewi&s;e, may <HI>bring forth fruit with patience.</HI></P>
<P>Mon. 2. Being &s;orrowful and very heavy (though I could give no particular rea&s;on for it) and utterly unwilling to &s;peak clo&s;e to any of my little flock (about twenty per&s;ons) I was in doubt, whether my neglect of them was not one cau&s;e of my own heavi|ne&s;s? In the evening therefore, I began in&s;tructing the cabin-boy; after which I was much ea&s;ier.</P>
<P>I went &s;everal times the following days, with a de|&s;ign to &s;peak to the &s;ailors, but could not, I mean, I was quite aver&s;e from &s;peaking; I could not &s;ee how to make an occa&s;ion, and it &s;eemed quite ab&s;urd to &s;peak without. Is not this what men commonly mean by, "I could not &s;peak?" And is this a &s;uf|ficient cau&s;e of &s;ilence, or no? Is it a prohibition from the Good Spirit? Or a temptation from nature or the evil one? Fri. 6. I ended the abridgment of Mr. de Renty's life. O that &s;uch a life &s;hould be related by &s;uch a hi&s;torian! Who by in&s;erting all, if not more than all the weak things that holy man ever &s;aid or did, by his commendation of almo&s;t every action or word which either de&s;erved or needed it not; and by his injudicious manner of relating many others, which were indeed highly commendable; has ca&s;t the &s;hade of &s;uper&s;tition and folly over one of the brighte&s;t patterns of heavenly wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>Sat. 7. I began to read and explain &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of the bible to the young negro. The next morn|ing, another negro who was on board, de&s;ired to be a hearer too. From them I went to the poor French|man, who under&s;tanding no Engli&s;h, had none el&s;e

<P>Sun. 8. In the fulne&s;s of my heart, I wrote the following words:</P>
<P>By the mo&s;t infallible of proofs, inward feeling, I am convinced</P>
<P N="1">1. "Of unbelief, having no &s;uch faith in Chri&s;t, as will prevent my heart from being troubled; which it could not be, if I believed in God, and rightly be|lieved al&s;o in him:</P>

This morning, after explaining tho&s;e words of St. Paul, <HI>I be&s;eech you, brethren, by the mercies of God, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ye pre&s;ent your bodies a living &s;acrifice, holy, accepta|ble to God.</HI> I exhorted my fellow-travellers with all my might, to comply with the apo&s;tle's direction.

<P>On Mond. 9, and the following days, I reflected much on that vain de&s;ire, which had pur&s;ued me for &s;o many years, of being in &s;olitude, in order to be a Chri&s;tian. I have now, thought I, &s;olitude enough. But am I therefore the nearer being a Chri&s;tian? Not if Je&s;us Chri&s;t be the model of Chri&s;tianity, I doubt indeed I am much nearer that my&s;tery of Satan, which &s;ome writers affect to call by that name. So near, that I had probably &s;unk wholly into it, had not the great mercy of God ju&s;t now thrown me up|on reading St. Cyprian's works. <HI>O my &s;oul, come not thou into their &s;ecret! Stand thou in the good old paths.</HI></P>
<P>Frid. 13. We had a thorough &s;torm, which obliged us to &s;hut all clo&s;e, the &s;ea breaking over the &s;hip con|tinually. I was at fir&s;t afraid; but cried to God and was &s;trengthened. Before ten I lay down. I ble&s;s God, without fear. About midnight we were awaked by a confu&s;ed noi&s;e, of &s;eas and wind and men's voices, the like to which I had never heard before. The &s;ound of the &s;ea breaking over, and again&s;t the &s;ides of the &s;hip, I could compare to nothing but large cannon, or American thunder. The rebound|ing, &s;tarting, quivering motion of the &s;hip, much re|&s;embled what is &s;aid of earthquakes. The captain was upon deck in an in&s;tant. But his men could not hear what he &s;aid. It blew a complete harricane; which beginning at &s;outh we&s;t, then went we&s;t, north|we&s;t, north, and in a quarter of an hour, round by the ea&s;t to the &s;outh-we&s;t point again. At the &s;ame
<PB N="97" REF="029861_0096_0FE2A976F7D05C50">time the &s;ea running (as they term it) mountain high, and that from many different points at once, the &s;hip would not obey the helm; nor indeed could the &s;teer&s;|man, through the violent rain, &s;ee the compa&s;s. So he was forced to let her run before the wind, and in half an hour the &s;tre&s;s of the &s;torm was over.</P>
<P>About noon the next day it ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed. But fir&s;t I had re&s;olved, God being my helper, not only to preach it to all, but to apply the word of God to every &s;in|gle &s;oul in the &s;hip; and if but one, yea if not one of them will hear, I know <HI>my labour is not in vain.</HI></P>
<P>I no &s;ooner executed this re&s;olution, than my &s;pirit revived; &s;o that from this day I had no more of that fearfulne&s;s and heavine&s;s, which before almo&s;t con|tinually weighed me down. I am &s;en&s;ible one who thinks the being <HI>in orco,</HI> as they phra&s;e it, an indi&s;|pen&s;able preparative for being a Chri&s;tian, would &s;ay, I had better have continued in that &s;tate; and that this un&s;ea&s;onable relief was a cur&s;e, not a ble&s;&s;ing. Nay, but who art thou, O man, who in favour of a wretched hypothe&s;is, thus bla&s;pheme&s;t the good gift of God? Hath not he him&s;elf &s;aid, <HI>This al&s;o is the gift of God, if a man have power to rejoice in his labour?</HI> Yea, God &s;etteth his own &s;eal to his weak endea|vours, while the thus <HI>an&s;wereth him in the joy of his heart.</HI></P>
<P>Tue&s;. 24. We &s;poke with two &s;hips, outward|bound, from whom we had the welcome news, of our wanting but 160 leagues of the land's-end. My mind was now full of thought; part of which I writ down as follows:</P>
<P>"I went to America, to convert the Indians; but oh! Who &s;hall convert me! Who, what is he tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> will deliver me from this evil heart of unbelief? I have a fair &s;ummer religion.

in the morning (the wind continuing &s;outherly) the clouds began to fly ju&s;t contrary to the wind, and to the &s;urprize of us all, &s;unk down under the &s;un, &s;o that at noon we had an exact ob&s;ervation; and by this we found we were as well as we could de&s;ire, about eleven leagues &s;outh of Scilly.</P>
<P>Sund. 29. We &s;aw Engli&s;h land once more, which about noon appeared to be the Lizard-point. We ran by it with a fair wind, and at noon the next day, made the we&s;t end of the I&s;le of Wight.</P>
<P>Here the wind turned again&s;t us, and in the even|ing blew fre&s;h, &s;o that we expected (the tide being likewi&s;e &s;trong again&s;t us) to be driven &s;ome leagues backward in the night: but in the morning, to our great &s;urprize, we &s;aw Beachy-head ju&s;t before us, and found we had gone forwards near forty miles.</P>
<P>Toward evening was a calm; but in the night a &s;trong north-wind brought us &s;afe into the Downs. The day before Mr. Whitefield had failed out, neither of us then knowing any thing of the other. At four in the morning we took boat, and in half an hour landed at Deal: it being Wedne&s;day, February 1. the anniver&s;ary fe&s;tival in Georgia for Mr. Oglethorpe's landing there.</P>
<P>It is now two years and almo&s;t four months, &s;ince I left my native country, in order to teach the Georgian Indians, the nature of Chri&s;tianity: but what have I learned my&s;elf in the mean time? Why (what I the lea&s;t of all &s;u&s;pected) that I who went to America to convert others, was never my&s;elf converted to God.

<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THAT <HI>men revile me and &s;ay all manner of evil again&s;t me,</HI> that <HI>I am become as it were a mon|&s;ter unto many,</HI> that the zealous of almo&s;t every deno|mination cry out, <HI>Away with &s;uch a fellow from the earth:</HI> this gives me with regard to my&s;elf, no degree of unea&s;ine&s;s. For I know the &s;cripture mu&s;t be ful|filled, <HI>If they have called the mo&s;ter of the hou&s;e Beelze|bub, how much more them of his hou&s;ehold?</HI> But it does give me a concern, with regard to tho&s;e, who by this artifice of the devil, are prevented from hearing that <HI>word, which is able to &s;ave their &s;ouls.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. For the &s;ake of the&s;e, and indeed of all who de&s;ire to hear the truth of tho&s;e things which have been &s;o variou&s;ly related, I have been induced to publi&s;h this farther account: and I doubt not but it will even hence appear, to all candid and impartial judges, <HI>that</HI> I have <HI>hitherto lived in all good con&s;cience toward God.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. I &s;hall be ea&s;ily excu&s;ed by tho&s;e who either <HI>love</HI> or &s;eek <HI>the Lord Je&s;us in &s;incerity,</HI> for &s;peaking &s;o largely of the Moravian church, <HI>a city</HI> which ought to be <HI>&s;et upon an hill.</HI> Their light hath been too long hid <HI>under a bu&s;hel:</HI> it is high time it &s;hould at length break forth, and <HI>&s;o &s;hine before men, that</HI> others al&s;o <HI>may glorify their Father which is in heaven.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. If any &s;hould a&s;k, "But do you think even this church is perfect, <HI>without &s;pot or wrinkle or any &s;uch thing?</HI>" I an&s;wer plainly, No; though I tru&s;t it
<PB N="106" REF="029861_0104_0FE2A991C932C068">will be, when <HI>patience has had its perfect work.</HI> But neither do I think it right, to entertain the world with the &s;pots of God's children.</P>
<P N="5">5. It has been farther a&s;ked, "Whether I ima|gine God is to be found, only among them?" I reply, "By no means. I know there is a God in England, and we need not go to &s;eek him in &s;trange lands." I know that in our own he is very nigh un|to all that call upon him: and therefore I think tho&s;e unwi&s;e (to &s;ay no more) who run to enquire after him in Holland or Germany.</P>
<P N="6">6. When I went, the ca&s;e was widely different. God had not then <HI>made bare his arm</HI> before us as he hath now done: in a manner (I will be bold to &s;ay) which had not been known either in Holland or Ger|many, at that time, when he who ordered all things wi&s;ely, according to the coun&s;els of his own will, was plea&s;ed by me to open the intercour&s;e between the Engli&s;h and the Moravi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> church.</P>
<P N="7">7. The particular rea&s;on which obliged me to relate &s;o much of the conver&s;ation I had with tho&s;e holy men, is this. In September, 1738, when I returned from Germany, I exhorted all I could to follow after that great &s;alvation, which is through faith in the blood of Chri&s;t; waiting for it, <HI>in all the ordinances of God,</HI> and in <HI>doing good as they bad opportunity, to all men.</HI> And many found the begin|ning of that &s;alvation, <HI>being ju&s;tified freely,</HI> having <HI>peace with God through Chri&s;t, rejoicing in hope of the glory of God,</HI> and having <HI>his love &s;hed abroad in their hearts.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. But about September, 1739, while my brother and I were ab&s;ent, certain men crept in among them unawares, greatly <HI>troubling and &s;ubverting their &s;ouls:</HI> telling them, "They were in a delu&s;ion, that they had deceived them&s;elves, and had <HI>no true faith</HI> at all. For (&s;aid they) none has any ju&s;tifying faith, who
<PB N="107" REF="029861_0105_0FE2A99450940C90">has ever any doubt or fear (which you know you have) or who has not a clean heart, which you know you have not: nor will you ever have it, till you leave off u&s;ing the means of grace (&s;o called) till you leave off running to church and &s;acrament, and praying, and &s;inging, and reading either the bible, or any other book. For you can't <HI>u&s;e</HI> the&s;e things without <HI>tru&s;ting</HI> in them. Therefore, till you leave them off, you can never have true faith; you can never till then tru&s;t in the blood of Chri&s;t."</P>
<P N="9">9. And this doctrine from the beginning to this day has been taught, as the doctrine of the Mora|vian church. I think therefore it is my bounden duty, to clear the Moravians from this a&s;per&s;ion. And the more, becau&s;e I am perhaps the only per&s;on now in England that both <HI>can</HI> and <HI>will</HI> do it. And I believe it is the peculiar providence of God that I <HI>can:</HI> that two years &s;ince the mo&s;t eminent members of that church, &s;hould &s;o fully declare both their experience and judgment, touching the very points now in que&s;tion.</P>
<P N="10">10. The &s;um of what has been a&s;&s;erted, as from them, is this,</P>
<P N="1">1. "That a man <HI>can't have any degree</HI> of ju&s;tifying faith, till he is wholly freed from all doubt and fear, and till he has (in the fall, proper &s;en&s;e) a new, a clean heart."</P>
<P N="2">2. "That a man <HI>may not u&s;e</HI> the ordinances of God, the <HI>Lord's Supper</HI> in particular, before he has &s;uch a faith as excludes all doubt and fear, and implies a new, a clean heart."</P>
<P>In flat oppo&s;ition to this I a&s;&s;ert,</P>
<P N="1">1. "That a man <HI>may have a degree</HI> of ju&s;tifying faith, before he is wholly freed from all doubt and fear, and before he has, in the full, proper &s;en&s;e, a new, a clean heart."</P>

<P>I farther a&s;&s;ert, "This I learned (not only from the Engli&s;h, but al&s;o) from the Moravian church."</P>
<P>And I hereby openly and earne&s;tly call upon that church (and upon Count Zinzendorf in particular, who I tru&s;t is not a&s;hamed nor afraid to avow any part of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t) to correct me and ex|plain them&s;elves, if I have mi&s;under&s;tood or mi&s;repre|&s;ented them.</P>

<HEAD>JOURNAL From <HI>Feb.</HI> 1, 1738, to <HI>Sept.</HI> 16, 1738.</HEAD>
<P>WEDNESDAY, Feb. 1. After reading prayers and explaining a portion of &s;cripture to a large company at the inn, I left Deal, and came in the evening to Fever&s;ham.</P>
<P>I here read prayers, and explained the 2d le&s;&s;on, to a few of tho&s;e who were called Chri&s;tians, but in|deed were more &s;avage in their behaviour than the wilde&s;t Indians I have yet met with.</P>
<P>Fri. 3. I came to Mr. Delamotte's at Blendo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, where I expected a cold reception. But God had prepared the way before me: and I no &s;ooner men|tioned my name, than I was welcomed in &s;uch a man|ner, as con&s;trained me to &s;ay, <HI>Surely God is in this place, and I knew it not! Ble&s;&s;ed be ye of the Lord! Ye have &s;hewn more kindne&s;s in the latter and than in the beginning.</HI></P>
<P>In the evening I came once more to London, whence I had been ab&s;ent two years and near four months.</P>
<P>Many rea&s;ons I have to ble&s;s God, though the de|&s;ign I went upon did not take effect, for my having been carried into that &s;trange land, contrary to all my preceding re&s;olutions. Hereby I tru&s;t he hath in &s;ome mea&s;ure <HI>humbled me and proved me, and &s;hewn me what was in my heart.</HI> Hereby I have been taught, to <HI>beware of men.</HI> Hereby I am come to know a&s;|&s;uredly,
<PB N="110" REF="029861_0108_0FE2A9A2A0EF9C30">that if <HI>in all our ways we acknowledge God,</HI> he will where rea&s;on fails, <HI>direct our path,</HI> by the other means which he knoweth. Hereby I am de|livered from the fear of the &s;ea, which I had both dreaded and abhorred from my youth.</P>
<P>Hereby God has given me to know many of his &s;ervants, particularly tho&s;e of the church of Hern|huth. Hereby my pa&s;&s;age is opened to the writings of holy men in the German, Spani&s;h and Italian tongues. I hope too &s;ome good may come to others hereby. All in Georgia have heard the word of God. Some have believed, and began to run well. A few &s;teps have been taken towards publi&s;hing the glad tidings both to the African and American Hea|thens. Many children have learned <HI>how they ought to &s;erve God,</HI> and to be u&s;eful to their neighbour. And tho&s;e whom it mo&s;t concerns have an opportunity of knowing the true &s;tate of their infant colony, and laying a firmer foundation of peace and happine&s;s to many generations.</P>
<P>Sat. 4. I told my friends &s;ome of the rea&s;ons; which a little ha&s;tened my return to England. They all agreed it would be proper to relate them to the tru&s;tees of Georgia.</P>
<P>Accordingly the next morning I waited on Mr. Oglethorpe, but had not time to &s;peak on that head. In the afternoon I was de&s;ired to preach at St. John the Evangeli&s;t's. I did &s;o on tho&s;e &s;trong words, <HI>If any man be in Chri&s;t, he is a new creature.</HI> I was after|wards informed, <HI>Many of the be&s;t in the pari&s;h were &s;o offended, that I was not to preach there any more.</HI></P>
<P>Mond. 6. I vi&s;ited many of my old friends, as well as mo&s;t of my relations. I find the time is not yet come when I am to be <HI>hated of all men.</HI> O may I be prepared for that day!</P>
<P>Tue&s;. 7. (A day much to be remembered) at the hou&s;e of Mr. Weinantz, a Dutch merchant, I met
<PB N="111" REF="029861_0109_0FE2A9A500B06058">Peter Bohler, Schulius Richter and Wen&s;el Nei&s;er, ju&s;t then landed from Germany. Finding they had no acquaintance in England, I offered to procure them a lodging, and did &s;o near Mr. Hutton's, where I then was. And from this time I did not willingly lo&s;e any opportunity of conver&s;ing with them, while I &s;tayed in London.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;. 8. I went to Mr. Oglethorpe again, but had no opportunity of &s;peaking as I de&s;igned. Af|terwards I waited on the board of tru&s;tees, and gave them a &s;hort but plain account of the &s;tate of the colony: an account, I fear, not a little differing from tho&s;e which they had frequently received before: and for which I have rea&s;on to believe, &s;ome of them have not forgiven me to this day.</P>
<P>Sund. 12. I preached at St. Andrew's, Holborn, on, <HI>Though I give all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.&mdash;O hard &s;ayings! Who can hear them?</HI> Here too (it &s;eems) I am to preach no more.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;. 15. I waited on the tru&s;tees again, and gave them in writing the &s;ub&s;tance of what I had &s;aid at the la&s;t board. What&s;oever farther que&s;tions they a&s;ked concerning the &s;tate of the province, I likewi&s;e an&s;wered to the be&s;t of my knowledge.</P>
<P>Fri. 17. I &s;et out for Oxford with Peter Bohler, where we were kindly received by Mr. Sarney, the only one now remaining here, of many who at our embarking for America, were u&s;ed <HI>to take &s;weet coun|&s;el together,</HI> and rejoice in <HI>bearing the reproach of Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Sat. 18. We went to Stanton-Harcourt, to Mr. Gambold, and found my old friend recovered from his <HI>my&s;tic</HI> delu&s;ion, and convinced that St. Paul was a better writer than either Tauler or Jacob Behman. The next day I preached once more at the ca&s;tle (in Oxford) to a numerous and &s;erious congregation.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="029861_0110_0FE2A9ACE6482BC0">
All this time I conver&s;ed much with Peter Bohler, but I under&s;tood him not: and lea&s;t of all when be|&s;aid, <Q><HI>Mi frater, mi frater, excoquenda e&s;t i&s;ta tua phi|lo&s;ophia.</HI></Q> (My brother, my brother, that philo|&s;ophy of your's mu&s;t be purged away.)</P>
<P>Mond. 20. I returned to London. On Tue&s;day I preached at Great St. Helen's, on, <HI>If any man will come after me, let him deny him&s;elf, and take up his cro&s;t daily and follow me.</HI></P>
<P>Wedn. 22. I was with the tru&s;tees again, to whom I then gave a &s;hort account (and afterwards delivered it to them in writing) of the rea&s;ons why I le&s;t Georgia.</P>
<P>Sun. 26. I preached at &s;ix at St. Lawrence's; at ten, in St. Katherine's Creed-church; and in the afternoon, at St. John's, Wapping. I believe it plea&s;ed God to ble&s;s the fir&s;t &s;ermon mo&s;t, becau&s;e it gave mo&s;t offence; being indeed an open defiance of that my&s;tery of iniquity which the world calls <HI>pru|dence:</HI> grounded on tho&s;e words of St. Paul to the Galatians; <HI>As many as de&s;ire to make a fair &s;hew in the fle&s;h, they con&s;train you to be circumci&s;ed, only le&s;t they &s;hould &s;uffer per&s;ecution for the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Mond. 27. I took coach for Sali&s;bury, and had &s;everal opportunities of conver&s;ing &s;eriou&s;ly with my fellow travellers. But endeavouring to mend the wi&s;|dom of God, by the worldly wi&s;dom of prefacing &s;eri|ous with light conver&s;ation, and afterwards following that advice of the <HI>my&s;tics, leave them to them&s;elves,</HI> all I had &s;aid was written on the &s;and. <HI>Lord, lay not this &s;in to my charge!</HI></P>
<P>Tue&s;. 28. I &s;aw my mother once more. The next day I prepared for my journey to my brother at Tiverton. But on Thur&s;day morning, March 2d, a me&s;&s;age <HI>that my brother Charles was dying at Oxford</HI> obliged me to &s;et out for that place immediately. Calling at an odd hou&s;e in the afternoon, I found
<PB N="113" REF="029861_0111_0FE2A9AE74D4AC68">&s;everal per&s;ons there, who &s;eemed well-wi&s;hers to re|gion, to whom I &s;pake plainly; as I did in the even|ing, both to the &s;ervants and &s;trangers at my inn.</P>
<P>With regard to my own behaviour, I now renewed and wrote down my former re&s;olutions.</P>
<P N="1">1. To u&s;e ab&s;olute openne&s;s and unre&s;erve, with all I &s;hould conver&s;e with.</P>
<P N="2">2. To labour after continual &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, not wil|lingly indulging my&s;elf, in any the lea&s;t levity of be|haviour, or in laughter, no not for a moment.</P>
<P N="3">3. To &s;peak no word which does not tend to the glory of God, in particular, not to talk of worldly things. Others may, nay, mu&s;t. But what is that to thee? And</P>
<P N="4">4. To take no plea&s;ure which does not tend to the glory of God; thanking God every moment for all I do take, and therefore rejecting every &s;ort and de|gree of it, which I feel I cannot &s;o thank him <HI>in</HI> and <HI>for.</HI></P>
<P>Sat. 4. I found my brother at Oxford, recovering from his pleuri&s;y; and with him Peter Bohler: by whom (in the hand of the great God) I was on Sun|day the 5th clearly convinced of unbelief, of the want of <HI>that faith whereby alone we are &s;aved with full chri&s;tian &s;alvation.</HI></P>
<P>Immediately it &s;truck into my mind <Q>Leave off preaching. How can you preach to others, who have not faith your&s;elf?</Q> I a&s;ked Bohler, whether he thought I &s;hould leave it off, or not? He an&s;wer|ed, "By no means." I a&s;ked, <Q>But what can I preach?</Q> He &s;aid, <Q>Preach faith <HI>till</HI> you have it, and then, <HI>becau&s;e</HI> you have it, you <HI>will</HI> preach faith.</Q></P>
<P>Accordingly, Monday 6, I began preaching this new doctrine, though my &s;oul &s;tarted back from the work. The fir&s;t per&s;on to whom I offered <HI>&s;alvation by faith alone,</HI> was a pri&s;oner under &s;entence of death.
<PB N="114" REF="029861_0112_0FE2A9B01532B260">His name was Clifford. Peter Bohler had many times de&s;ired me to &s;peak to him before. But I could not prevail on my&s;elf &s;o to do; being &s;till (as I had been many years) a zealous a&s;&s;ertor of <HI>the impo&s;&s;ibility of a death-bed repentance.</HI></P>
<P>Fri. 10. Peter Bohler returned to London. Tue&s;. 15. I &s;et out for Manche&s;ter, with Mr. Kinchin, Fellow of Corpus Chri&s;ti, and Mr. Fox, late a pri|&s;oner in the city pri&s;on. Between five and &s;ix we called at Chappel on the Heath, where lived a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> man, &s;ometime pri&s;oner in the ca&s;tle of Oxford. He was not at home; but his wife came to us, to whom Mr. Kinchin &s;poke a few words, which &s;o melted her heart, that &s;he bur&s;t out into tears, and we went on rejoicing and prai&s;ing God.</P>
<P>About eight, it being rainy and very dark we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> our way; but before nine, came to Ship&s;ton, having rode over, I know not how, a narrow foot-bridge, which lay a-cro&s;s a deep ditch near the town. After &s;upper I read prayers to the people of the inn, and explained the &s;econd le&s;&s;on; I hope not in vain.</P>
<P>The next day we dined at Birmingham, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> after we left it, were reproved for our negligence them (in letting tho&s;e who attended us go, without exhorta|tion or in&s;truction) by a &s;evere &s;hower of hail. At Hedge&s;ord, about five, we endeavoured to be more faithful; and all who heard, &s;eemed &s;erious and af|fected.</P>
<P>In the evening we came to Stafford. The mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e joined with us in family-prayer. The next morning, one of the &s;ervants appeared deeply affected, as did the ho&s;tler before we went. Soon after breakfa&s;t, &s;tepping into the &s;table, I &s;pake a few words to tho&s;e who were there. A &s;tranger who heard me, &s;aid, <HI>Sir, I wi&s;h I was to travel with you.</HI> And wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> I went into the hou&s;e followed me, and began abrupt|ly, <HI>Sir, I believe you are a good man, and I come to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="115" REF="029861_0113_0FE2A9B1A7F74ED8">you a little of my life.</HI> The tears &s;tood in his eyes all the time he &s;poke; and we hoped not a word which was &s;aid to him was lo&s;t.</P>
<P>At Newca&s;tle, whither we came about ten, &s;ome to whom we &s;poke at our inn, were very attentive; but a gay young woman waited on us, quite unconcerned: however we &s;poke on. When we went away, &s;he fixed her eyes, and neither moved nor &s;aid one word, but appeared as much a&s;toni&s;hed as if &s;he had &s;een one ri&s;en from the dead.</P>
<P>Coming to Holms-chapel about three, we were &s;ur|prized at being &s;hewn into a room, where a cloth and plates were laid. Soon after two men came in to din|ner. Mr. Kinchin told them, "If they plea&s;ed, that gentleman would a&s;k a ble&s;&s;ing for them." They &s;tared, and <HI>as it were</HI> con&s;ented; but &s;at &s;till while I did it, one of them with his hat on. We began to &s;peak on turning to God, and went on, though they appeared utterly regardle&s;s. After a while their coun|tenances changed, and one of them &s;tole off his hat, and laying it down behind him &s;aid, <Q>All we &s;aid was true; but he had been a grievous &s;inner, and not con&s;idered it as he ought: but he was re&s;olved, with God's help, now to turn to him in earne&s;t.</Q> We exhorted him and his companion, who now likewi&s;e drank in every word, to cry mightily to God, that <HI>he would &s;end them help from his holy place.</HI></P>
<P>Being faint in the evening, I called at Altringham, and there light upon a Quaker, well &s;killed in, and therefore (as I &s;oon found) &s;ufficiently fond of, con|trover&s;y. After an hour &s;pent therein (perhaps not in vain) I advi&s;ed him, <Q>To di&s;pute as little as po&s;&s;ible, but rather follow after holine&s;s, and walk humbly with his God.</Q></P>
<P>Late at night we reached Manche&s;ter. Friday the 17th, we &s;pent intirely with Mr. Clayton, by whom, and the re&s;t of our friends here, we were much refre&s;h|ed
<PB N="116" REF="029861_0114_0FE2A9BAB789A6C0">and &s;trengthened. Mr. Hoole, the rector of St. Ann's church being taken ill the next day, on Sunday 19, Mr. Kinchin and I officiated at Salford chapel in the morning, by which means Mr. Clayton was at liberty to perform the &s;ervice of St. Ann's: and in the afternoon, I preached there on tho&s;e words of St. Paul, <HI>If any man be in Chri&s;t, he is a new creature.</HI></P>
<P>Early in the morning we left Manche&s;ter, taking with us Mr. Kinchin's brother, for whom we came, to be entered at Oxford. We were fully determined to lo&s;e no opportunity of awakening, in&s;tructing, or exhorting any whom we might meet with in our journey. At Knutsford, where we fir&s;t &s;topped, all we &s;pake to, thankfully received the word of exhorta|tion. But at <HI>Talk in the hill,</HI> where we dined, &s;he with whom we were, was &s;o much of a gentlewomen, that for near an hour our labour &s;eemed to be in vain. However we &s;poke on. Upon a &s;udden, &s;he looked as one ju&s;t awaked out of a &s;leep. Every word &s;unk into her heart. Nor have I &s;een &s;o entire a change both in the eyes, face, and manner of &s;peaking, of any one in &s;o &s;hort a time.</P>
<P>About 5. Mr. Kinchin riding by a man and wo|man double-hor&s;ed, the man &s;aid, "Sir, you ought to thank God it is a fair day,; for if it rained, you would be &s;adly dirty with your little hor&s;e." Mr. Kinchin an&s;wered, "True: and we ought to thank God for our life and health, and food and rai|ment, and all things." He then rode on, Mr. Fox following the man &s;aid, "Sir, my mi&s;tre&s;s would be glad to have &s;ome more talk with that gentleman." We &s;tayed, and when they came up, began to &s;earch one another's hearts. They came to us again in the evening, at our inn at Stone, where I explained both to them and many of their acquaintance who were come together, that great truth, <HI>"Godline&s;s, hath
<PB N="117" REF="029861_0115_0FE2A9BCDE26D770">the promi&s;e both of this life, and of that which is to come."</HI></P>
<P>Tue&s;. 21. Between 9 and 10 we came to Hedge|ford. Ju&s;t then, one was giving an account of a young woman, who had dropped down dead there the day before. This gave us a fair occa&s;ion to ex|hort all that were pre&s;ent, <HI>So to number their own days that they might apply their hearts unto wi&s;dom.</HI></P>
<P>In the afternoon one overtook us whom we &s;oon found more inclined to &s;peak than to hear. However we &s;poke and &s;pared not. In the evening we over|took a young man, a Quaker, who afterwards came to us, to our inn at Henley, whither he &s;ent for the re&s;t of his family, to join with us in prayer: to which I added, as u&s;ual, the expo&s;ition of the 2d le&s;&s;on. Our other companion went with us a mile or two in the morning, and then not only &s;poke le&s;s than the day before; but took in good part a &s;erious cau|tion again&s;t talkativene&s;s and vanity.</P>
<P>An hour after, we were overtook by an elderly gen|tleman, who &s;aid, "He was going to enter his &s;on at Oxford." We a&s;ked, "At what college?" He &s;aid, "he did not know: having no acquaintance there on who&s;e recommendation he could depend." After &s;ome conver&s;ation, he expre&s;&s;ed a deep &s;en&s;e of the good providence of God, and told us, "He knew God had ca&s;t us in his way, in an&s;wer to his prayer." In the evening we reached Oxford, rejoicing in our having received &s;o many fre&s;h in&s;tances of that great truth, <HI>In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he &s;hall direct thy paths.</HI></P>
<P>Thur&s;. 23. I met Peter Bohler again, who now amazed me more and more, by the account he gave of the fruits of living faith, the holine&s;s and happi|ne&s;s which he affirmed to attend it. The next morn|ing I began the Greek Te&s;tament again, re&s;olving to abide by <HI>the law and the te&s;timony,</HI> and being confident,
<PB N="118" REF="029861_0116_0FE2A9BE8DE6D680">that God would hereby &s;hew me, <HI>whether</HI> this <HI>doctrine was of God.</HI></P>
<P>Sund. 26. I preached at Whitam, on <HI>the new creature,</HI> and went in the evening to a &s;ociety in Ox|ford, where (as my manner then was at all &s;ocieties) after u&s;ing a collect or two and the Lord's prayer, I expounded a chapter in the New Te&s;tament, and concluded with three or four more collects and a p&s;alm.</P>
<P>Mond. 27. Mr. Kinchin went with me to the ca&s;tle, where after reading prayers and preaching, on, <HI>It is appointed for men once to die,</HI> we prayed with the condemned man, fir&s;t in &s;everal forms of prayer, and then in &s;uch words as were given us in that hour. He kneeled down in much heavine&s;s and confu&s;ion, having <HI>no re&s;t in his bones, by rea&s;on of his &s;ins.</HI> After a &s;pace he ro&s;e up, and eagerly &s;aid, <HI>I am now ready to die. I know Chri&s;t has taken away my &s;ins, and there is no more condemnation for me.</HI> The &s;ame compo&s;ed cheerfulne&s;s he &s;hewed, when he was carried to execu|tion: and in his la&s;t moments he was the &s;ame, en|joying a perfect peace, in confidence that he was <HI>ac|cepted in the beloved.</HI></P>
<P>Sat. April 1. Being at Mr. Fox's &s;ociety, my heart was &s;o full that I could not confine my&s;elf to the forms of prayer, which we were accu&s;tomed to u&s;e there. Neither do I purpo&s;e to be confined to them any more; but to pray indifferently, with a form or without, as I may find &s;uitable to particular occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Sund. 2. Being Ea&s;ter-day, I preached in our college chapel, on, <HI>The hour cometh and now is, when the dead &s;hall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ear &s;hall live.</HI> I preached in the afternoon fir&s;t at the ca&s;tle, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> at Car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ax on the &s;ame words, I &s;ee the promi&s;e. But it is afar off.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="029861_0117_0FE2A9C01BE0AC48">
Believing it would be better for me to wait for the accompli&s;hment of it in &s;ilence and retirement, on Mond. 3. I complied with Mr. Kinchin's de&s;ire, and went to him at Dummer in Hamp&s;hire. But I was not &s;uffered to &s;tay here long; being earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed to come up to London, if it were only for a few days. Thither therefore I returned, on Tue&s;. 17th.</P>
<P>Sat. 21. I met Peter Bohler once more. I had now no objection to what he &s;aid of the nature of faith, <HI>viz.</HI> That it is (to u&s;e the words of our church) <HI>A &s;ure tru&s;t and confidence which a man hath in God, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> through the merits of Chri&s;t,</HI> his <HI>&s;ins are forgiven, and</HI> he <HI>reconciled to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">avour of God.</HI> Neither could I deny either the happine&s;s or holine&s;s which he de|&s;cribed, as fruits of this living faith. <HI>The Spirit it|&s;elf beareth witne&s;s with our &s;pirit that we are the chil|dren of God:</HI> and, <HI>He that believeth hath the witne&s;s in him&s;elf,</HI> fully convinced me of the former: As, <HI>What&s;oever is born of God, doth not commit &s;in;</HI> and <HI>Who&s;oever believeth, is born of God,</HI> did of the latter. But I could not comprehend what he &s;poke of an <HI>in&s;tantaneous work.</HI> I could not under&s;tand how this faith &s;hould be given in a moment: how a man could <HI>at once</HI> be thus turned from darkne&s;s to light, from &s;in and mi&s;ery to righteou&s;ne&s;s and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t. I &s;earched the &s;criptures again, touching this very thing, particularly the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cts of the apo&s;tles.</HI> But, to my utter a&s;toni&s;hment, found &s;carce any in|&s;tances there of other than <HI>in&s;tantaneous</HI> conver&s;ion; &s;carce any &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">low as that of St. Paul, who was three days in the pangs of the new birth. I had but one retreat le&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> "<HI>Thus,</HI> I grant God wrought in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> ages of Chri&s;tianity: but the times are chang|ed. What rea&s;on have I to believe, he works in the &s;ame manner now?"</P>
<P>But on Sund. 22. I was beat out of this retreat too, by the concurring evidence of &s;everal living wit|ne&s;&s;es;
<PB N="120" REF="029861_0118_0FE2A9C96104DD98">who te&s;tified <HI>God had thus wrought in them|&s;elves;</HI> giving them in a moment, &s;uch a faith in the blood of his Son, as tran&s;lated them out of darkne&s;s into light, out of &s;in and fear into holine&s;s and hap|pine&s;s. Here ended my di&s;puting. I could now only "cry out, <HI>Lord help thou my unbelief!</HI>"</P>
<P>I a&s;ked P. Bohler again, "Whether I ought not to refrain from teaching others?" He &s;aid, "No; Do not hide in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arth the talent God hath given you." Accordingly on Tue&s;. 25. I &s;poke clearly and fully at Blendon to Mr. Delamotte's family, of the nature and fruits of faith. Mr. Broughton and my brother were there. Mr. Broughton's great ob|jection was, <HI>He could never think that I had not faith, who had done and &s;uffered &s;uch things.</HI> My brother was very angry, and told me <HI>I did not know what mi&s;chief I had done by talking thus.</HI> And indeed it did plea&s;e God then to kindle a fire, which I tru&s;t &s;hall never be extingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;. 21. The day fixed for my return to Oxford, I once more waited on the tru&s;tees for Georgia: but being &s;traitened for time, was obliged to leave the papers for them, which I had de&s;igned to give into their own hands. One of the&s;e was the in&s;trument whereby they had appointed me mini&s;ter of Savannah; which having no more place in tho&s;e parts, I thought it not right to keep any longer.</P>
<P>P. Bohler walked with me a few miles, and ex|horted me not to &s;top &s;hort of the grace of God. At Gerrard's Cro&s;s I plainly declared to tho&s;e whom. God gave into my hands, <HI>The faith as it is in Je&s;us:</HI> as I did next day to a young man I overtook on the road, and in the evening to our friends at Oxford. A &s;trange doctrine, which &s;ome, who did not care to contradict, yet knew not what to make of; but one or two, who were throughly brui&s;ed by &s;in, will|ingly heard, and received it gladly.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="029861_0119_0FE2A9CB620B35C0">
In the day or two following, I was much confirm|ed in the <HI>truth that is after godline&s;s,</HI> by hearing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> experiences of Mr. Hutchins (of Pembroke-college) and Mrs. Fox: two living witne&s;&s;e&s;s that God <HI>can</HI> (at lea&s;t, if he <HI>does</HI> not always) give that faith where|of cometh &s;alvation in a moment, as lightning falling from heaven.</P>
<P>Mond. May 1. The return of my brother's ill|ne&s;s obliged me again to ha&s;ten to London. In the evening I found him at James Hutton's, better as to his health, than I expected; but &s;trongly aver&s;e from what he called The <HI>New Faith.</HI></P>
<P>This evening our little &s;ociety began, which af|terwards met in Fetter-lane. Our fundamental rules were as follow.</P>
<P>In obedience to the command of God by St. James, and by the advice of Peter Bohler, it is agreed by us,</P>
<P N="1">1. That we will meet together once a week to <HI>con|fe&s;s our faults one to another, and pray one for another, that we may be healed:</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. That the per&s;ons &s;o meeting be divided into &s;e|veral <HI>bands,</HI> or little companies, none of them con|&s;i&s;ting of fewer than five or more than ten per&s;ons.</P>
<P N="3">3. That every one in order &s;peak as freely, plain|ly, and conci&s;ely as he can, the real &s;tate of his heart, with his &s;everal temptations and deliverances, &s;ince the la&s;t time of meeting.</P>
<P N="4">4. That all the bands have a conference at eight every Wedne&s;day evening, began and ended with &s;inging and prayer.</P>
<P N="5">5. That any who de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ire to be admitted into this &s;ociety be a&s;ked, What are your rea&s;ons for de&s;iring this?

<P N="6"><PB N="122" REF="029861_0120_0FE2A9CCEFF07218">
6. That when any new member is propo&s;ed, every one pre&s;ent &s;peak clearly and freely whatever objection he has to him.</P>

<P>Sun. 14. I preached in the morning at St. Ann's, Alder&s;gate; and in the afternoon at the Savoy chapel, free &s;alvation by faith in the blood of Chri&s;t. I was quickly apprized, that at St. Ann's likewi&s;e, I am to preach no more.</P>
<P>So true did I find the words of a friend, wrote to my brother about this time.</P>
<P>"I have &s;een upon this occa&s;ion, more than ever I could have imagined, how intolerable the doctrine of faith is to the mind of man; and how peculiarly in|tolerable to <HI>religious</HI> men. One may &s;ay the mo&s;t unchri&s;tian things, even down to dei&s;m; the mo&s;t en|thu&s;ia&s;tic things, &s;o they proceed but upon mental raptures, lights and unions; the mo&s;t &s;evere things, even the whole rigour of a&s;cetic mortification; and all this will be forgiven. But if you &s;peak of faith in &s;uch a manner as makes Chri&s;t a Saviour to the utmo&s;t, a mo&s;t univer&s;al help and refuge; in &s;uch a manner as takes away glorying, but adds happine&s;s to wretched man; as di&s;covers a greater pollution in the be&s;t of us, than we could before acknowledge, but brings a great|er deliverance from it than we could before expect: if any one offers to talk at this rate, he &s;hall be heard with the &s;ame abhorrence, as if he was going to rob
<PB N="126" REF="029861_0124_0FE2A9DBD8AE9E68">mankind of their &s;alvation, their mediator, or the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> hopes of forgivene&s;s. I am per&s;uaded that a <HI>Monta|ni&s;t</HI> or a <HI>Novatian,</HI> who from the height of his purity &s;hould look down with contempt upon poor &s;inners, and exclude them from all mercy, would not be thought &s;uch an overthrower of the go&s;pel, as he who &s;hould learn from the author of it, to be a friend of Publicans and Sinners, and to &s;it down upon the level with them, as &s;oon as they begin to repent."</P>
<P>"But this is not to be wondered at. For all <HI>religi|ous</HI> people have &s;uch a quantity of righteou&s;ne&s;s, ac|quired by much painful exerci&s;e, and formed at la&s;t into current habits; which is their wealth, both for this world and the next. Now all other &s;chemes of religion, are either &s;o complai&s;ant, as to tell them, they are very rich, and have enough to triumph in: or el&s;e only a little rough, but friendly in the main, by telling them, their riches are not yet &s;ufficient, but by &s;uch arts of &s;elf-denial, and mental refinement, they may enlarge the &s;tock. But the doctrine of faith is a downright robber. It takes away all this wealth, and only tells us, it is depo&s;ited for us with &s;ome body el&s;e, upon who&s;e bounty we mu&s;t live like mere beggars. Indeed they that are truly beggars, vile and filthy &s;in|ners till very lately, may &s;toop to live in this de|pendent condition: it &s;uits them well enough. But they who have long di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves from the herd of vicious wretches, or have even gone beyond <HI>moral</HI> men; for them to be told, that they are either not &s;o well, or but the &s;ame needy, impotent, in&s;ig|nificant ve&s;&s;els of mercy, with the others: this is more &s;hocking to rea&s;on, than tran&s;ub&s;tantiation. For rea|&s;on had rather re&s;ign its preten&s;ions to judge what is bread or fle&s;h, than have this honour wre&s;ted from it to be the architect of virtue and righteou&s;ne&s;s. But where am I running? My de&s;ign was only to give you
<PB N="127" REF="029861_0125_0FE2A9DD682CA330">warning, that wherever you go, <HI>this fooli&s;hne&s;s of preach|ing</HI> will alienate hearts from you, and open mouths again&s;t you."</P>
<P>Fri. 19. My brother had a &s;econd return of his pleuri&s;y. A few of us &s;pent Saturday night in prayer. The next day, being Whit&s;unday, after hearing Dr. Heylin preach a truly Chri&s;tian &s;ermon (on, <HI>They were all filled with the Holy Gho&s;t:</HI> and &s;o, &s;aid he, may <HI>all you</HI> be, if it is not your own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ault) and a&s;&s;i&s;ting him at the holy communion (his curate being taken ill in the church) I received the &s;urprizing news, that my brother had found re&s;t to his &s;oul. His bodily &s;trength returned al&s;o from that hour. <HI>Who is &s;o great a God as our God?</HI></P>
<P>I preached at St. John's W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pping, at three, and St. Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nett's, Paul's-wharf, in the evening. At the&s;e churches likewi&s;e I am to preach no more. At St. Antholin's I preached on the Thur&s;day fol|lowing.</P>
<P>Monday, Tue&s;day and Wedne&s;day, I had conti|nual &s;orrow and heavine&s;s in my heart; &s;omething of which I de&s;cribed, in the broken manner I was able, in the following letter to a friend.</P>
<P>"O why is it, that &s;o great, &s;o wi&s;e, &s;o holy a God will u&s;e &s;uch an in&s;trument as me! Lord <HI>let the dead bury their dead?</HI> But wilt thou &s;end the dead to rai&s;e the dead? Yea, thou &s;ende&s;t whom thou <HI>wilt</HI> &s;end, and &s;hewe&s;t mercy by whom thou <HI>wilt</HI> &s;hew mercy! Amen! Be it then according to thy will! If thou &s;peak the word, Judas &s;hall ca&s;t out devils.</P>
<P>I feel what you &s;ay (though not enough) for I am under the &s;ame condemnation. I &s;ee that the whole law of God is holy, ju&s;t and good. I know every thought, every temper of my &s;oul, ought to bear God's image and &s;uper&s;cription. But how am I fallen from the glory of God! I feel, that <HI>I am &s;old
<PB N="128" REF="029861_0126_0FE2A9E8C742CB90">under &s;in.</HI> I know, that I too de&s;erve nothing but wrath, being full of all abominations: and having no good thing in me to atone for them, or to remove the wrath of God. All my works, my righteou&s;ne&s;s, my prayers, need an atonement for them&s;elves. So that my mouth is &s;topped. I have nothing to plead. God is holy, I am unholy. God is a con&s;uming fire. I am altogether a &s;inner, meet to be con&s;umed.</P>
<P>"Yet I hear a voice (and is it not the voice of God?) &s;aying, <HI>Believe and thou &s;halt be &s;aved. He that believeth, is pa&s;&s;ed from death unto life. God &s;o loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that who&s;oever believeth on him, &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life.</HI></P>
<P>"O let no one deceive us by vain words, as if we had already attained this &s;aith! i. e. The proper chri&s;tian faith. By its fruits we &s;hall know. Do we already feel <HI>peace with God,</HI> and <HI>joy in the Holy Gho&s;t?</HI> Does <HI>his Spirit bear witne&s;s with our &s;pirit, that we are the children of God?</HI> Alas, with mine he does not. Nor, I fear with yours. O thou Saviour of men, &s;ave us from tru&s;ting in any thing but <HI>thee!</HI> Draw us after thee! Let us be emptied of our&s;elves, and then fill us with all peace and joy in believing, and let nothing &s;eparate us from thy love, in time or in eternity!"</P>
<P>What occurred on Wedne&s;day 24, I think be&s;t to relate at large, after premi&s;ing what may make it the better under&s;tood. Let him that cannot receive it, a&s;k of the Father of lights, that he would give more light to him and me.</P>
<P N="1">1. I believe, till I was about ten years old, I had not &s;inned away that <HI>initial grace</HI> which was given me in infancy having been &s;trictly edu|cated and carefully taught, that I could only be &s;aved <HI>by univer&s;al obedience, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eeping all the commandments of God,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the meaning of which I was diligently in&s;truct|ed. And tho&s;e in&s;tructions, &s;o far as they re&s;pected
<PB N="129" REF="029861_0127_0FE2A9EAA8624990">outward duties and &s;ins, I gladly received, and often thought of. But all that was &s;aid to me of inward obedience, or holine&s;s, I neither under&s;tood nor re|membered. So that I was indeed as ignorant of the true meaning of the law, as I was of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. The next &s;ix or &s;even years were &s;pent at &s;chool: where outward re&s;traints being removed, I was much more negligent than before even of outward duties, and almo&s;t continually guilty of outward <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ins, which I knew to be &s;uch, though they were not &s;candalous in the eye of the world. However I &s;till read the &s;crip|tures, and &s;aid my prayers, morning and evening. And what I now hoped to be &s;aved by, was, 1. <HI>Not being &s;o bad a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> other people.</HI> 2. <HI>Having &s;till a kindne&s;s for religion.</HI> And 3. <HI>Reading the bible, going to church, and &s;aying my prayers.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Being removed to the univer&s;ity, for five years, I &s;till &s;aid my prayers both in public and in private, and read with the &s;criptures &s;everal other books of religion, e&s;pecially comments on the New Te&s;tament. Yet I had not all this while &s;o much as a notion of in|ward holine&s;s: nay, went on habitually and for the mo&s;t part) very contentedly, in &s;ome or other known <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in: indeed with &s;ome intermi&s;&s;ion and &s;hort &s;truggles, e&s;pecially before and after the Holy Communion, which I was obliged to receive thrice a year: I can|not well tell, what I hoped to be &s;aved by now, when I was continually &s;inning again&s;t the little light I had: unle&s;s by tho&s;e tran&s;ient fits of what many divines taught me to call <HI>repentance.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. When I was about 22, my father pre&s;&s;ed me to enter into holy orders. At the &s;ame time the provi|dence of God directing me to Kempis<HI>'s Chri&s;tian Pat|tern,</HI> I began to &s;ee, that true religion was &s;eated in the heart, and that God's law extended to all our thoughts as well as words and actions. I was how|ever
<PB N="130" REF="029861_0128_0FE2A9EC37717758">very angry at Kempis, for being <HI>too &s;trict,</HI> though I read him only in Dean Stan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ope's tran&s;lation. Yet I had frequently much &s;en&s;ible comfort in reading him, &s;uch as I was an utter &s;tranger to before: and meeting likewi&s;e with a religious friend, which I never had till now, I began to alter the whole form of my conver|&s;ation, and to &s;et in earne&s;t upon <HI>a new life.</HI> I &s;et apart an hour or two a day for religious retirement. I communicated every week. I watched again&s;t all &s;in, whether in word or deed. I began to aim at, and pray for inward holine&s;s. So that now, <HI>doing &s;o much, and living &s;o good a life,</HI> I doubted not but I was a good Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P N="5">5. Removing &s;oon after to another college, I exe|cuted a re&s;olution, which I was before convinced was of the utmo&s;t importance, &s;haking off at once all my trifling acquaintance. I began to &s;ee more and more the value of time. I applied my&s;elf clo&s;er to &s;tudy. I watched more carefully again&s;t actual &s;ins; I advi&s;ed others to be religious, according to that &s;cheme of re|ligion by which I modelled my own life. But meet|ing now with Mr. Law's <HI>Chri&s;tian Perfection and Se|rious Call</HI> (although I was much offended at many parts of both, yet) they convinced me more than ever of the exceeding height, and breadth, and depth of the law of God. The light flowed in &s;o mightily upon my &s;oul, that every thing appeared in a new view. I cried to God for help, and re&s;olved not to prolong the time of obeying him as I had never done before. And by my continued <HI>endeavour to keep his whole law,</HI> inward and outward, <HI>to the utmo&s;t of my power,</HI> I was per&s;uaded that I &s;hould be accepted of him, and that I was even then in a &s;tate of &s;alvation.</P>
<P N="6">6. In 17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">0, I began vi&s;iting the pri&s;ons, a&s;&s;i&s;ting the poor and &s;ick in town, and doing what other good I could by my pre&s;ence or my little fortune to the bodies and &s;ouls of all men. To this end I abridged
<PB N="131" REF="029861_0129_0FE2A9EDCBB22BD0">my&s;elf of all &s;uperfluities, and many that are called nece&s;&s;aries of life. I &s;oon became a <HI>by-word</HI> for &s;o doing, and I rejoiced that my <HI>name was ca&s;t out as evil.</HI> The next &s;pring I began ob&s;erving the Wedne&s;day and Friday fa&s;ts, commonly ob&s;erved in the ancient church; ta&s;ting no food till three in the afternoon. And now I knew not how to go any farther. I dili|gently &s;trove again&s;t all &s;in. I omitted no &s;ort of &s;elf-denial which I thought lawful: I carefully u&s;ed, both in public and private, all the means of grace at all opportunities. I omitted no occa&s;ion of doing good; I for that rea&s;on &s;uffered evil. And all this I knew to be nothing, unle&s;s as it was directed to|ward inward holine&s;s. Accordingly this, the image of God, was what I aimed at in all, by doing his will, not my own. Yet when after continuing &s;ome years in this cour&s;e, I apprehended my&s;elf to be near death, I could not find that all this gave me any comfort, or any a&s;&s;urance of acceptance with God. At this I was then not a little &s;urprized: not imagining I had been all this time building on the &s;and, nor con|&s;idering that <HI>other foundation can no man lay, than that which is laid by God, even Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Soon after, a contemplative man convinced me &s;till more than I was convinced before, that outward works are nothing, being alone; and in &s;everal con|ver&s;ations in&s;tructed me, how to pur&s;ue inward holi|ne&s;s, or a union of the &s;oul with God. But even of his in&s;tructions (though I then received them as the words of God) I cannot but now ob&s;erve, 1. That he &s;poke &s;o incautiou&s;ly again&s;t <HI>tru&s;ting</HI> in <HI>out|ward works,</HI> that he di&s;couraged me from <HI>doing</HI> them at all. 2. That he recommended (as it were, to &s;upply what was wanting in them) <HI>mental prayer,</HI> and the like exerci&s;es, as the mo&s;t effectual means of purifying the &s;oul, and uniting it with God. Now the&s;e were in truth, as much <HI>my own works</HI> as vi&s;iting
<PB N="132" REF="029861_0130_0FE2A9FBD0E19050">the &s;ick or cloathing the naked, and the <HI>union with God</HI> thus pur&s;ued, was as really <HI>my own righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> as any I had before pur&s;ued, under another name.</P>
<P N="8">8. In this refined way of tru&s;ting to my own works and my own righteou&s;ne&s;s (&s;o zealou&s;ly inculcated by the my&s;tic writers) I dragged on heavily, finding no comfort or help therein, till the time of my leaving England. On &s;hipboard however I was again active in outward works; where it plea&s;ed God of his free mercy, to give me 26 of the Moravian brethren for companions, who endeavoured to &s;hew me a more ex|cellent way. But I under&s;tood it not at fir&s;t. I was too learned and too wi&s;e. So that it &s;eemed fooli&s;h|ne&s;s unto me. And I continued preaching and fol|lowing after and tru&s;ting in that righteou&s;ne&s;s, where|by no fle&s;h can be ju&s;tified.</P>
<P N="9">9. All the time I was at Savannah I was thus <HI>beat|ing the air.</HI> Being ignorant of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, which by a living faith in him bringeth &s;alva|tion <HI>to every one that believeth,</HI> I &s;ought to e&s;tabli&s;h my own righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;o laboured in the fire all my days. I was now, properly <HI>under the law;</HI> I knew that <HI>the law</HI> of God was <HI>&s;piritual; I con&s;ented to it, that it was good.</HI> Yea, <HI>I delighted in it, after the inner man.</HI> Yet was I <HI>carnal, &s;old under &s;in.</HI> Every day was I con&s;trained to cry out, <HI>What I do, I allow not; for what I would, I do not, but what I hate, that I do. To will is indeed pre&s;ent with me: but how to perform that which is good, I find not.</HI> For <HI>the good which I would, I do not; but the evil which I would not, that I do. I find a law, that when I would do good, evil is pre&s;ent with me:</HI> even <HI>the law in my mem|bers warring again&s;t the law of my mind,</HI> and &s;till <HI>bring|ing me into captivity to the law of &s;in.</HI></P>

I fell and ro&s;e, and fell again. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ometimes I was overcome, and in heavi|ne&s;s: Sometimes I overcame, and was in joy. For as in the former &s;tate, I had &s;ome foreta&s;tes of the terrors of the law, &s;o had I in this, of the comforts of the go&s;pel. During this whole &s;truggle between nature and grace (which had now continued above ten years) I had many remarkable returns to prayer, e&s;pecially when I was in trouble: I had many &s;en&s;ible comforts, which are indeed no other than &s;hort anticipations of the life of faith. But I was &s;till <HI>under the law,</HI> not <HI>under grace</HI> (the &s;tate mo&s;t who are called Chri&s;tians are con|tent to live and die in.) For I was only <HI>&s;triving with,</HI> not <HI>freed from &s;in:</HI> neither had I <HI>the witne&s;s of the Spirit with my &s;pirit,</HI> and indeed could not; for <HI>I &s;ought it not by faith, but (as it were) by the works of the law.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. In my return to England, January 1738, be|ing in imminent danger of death, and very unea&s;y on that account, I was &s;trongly convinced that the cau&s;e of that unea&s;ine&s;s was unbelief, and that the gaining a true, living faith, was the <HI>one thing needful for</HI> me. But &s;till I fixed not this faith on its right object: I meant only faith in God, not faith in or through Chri&s;t. Again, I knew not that I was <HI>wholly void of this faith;</HI> but only thought, <HI>I had not enough</HI> of it. So that when Peter Bohler, whom God prepared for me as &s;oon as I came to London, affirmed of true faith in Chri&s;t (which is but one) that it had tho&s;e two fruits in&s;eparably attending it, "Dominion over &s;in, and con&s;tant peace from a &s;en&s;e of forgivene&s;s," I was quite amazed, and looked up|on it as a new go&s;pel. If this was &s;o, it was clear, I had not faith. But I was not willing to be con|vinced of this. Therefore I di&s;puted with all my might, and laboured to prove, that faith might be where the&s;e were not; e&s;pecially where the &s;en&s;e of
<PB N="134" REF="029861_0132_0FE2A9FEF2E2C390">forgivene&s;s was not: for all the &s;criptures relating to this, I had been long &s;ince taught to con&s;true away, and to call all Pre&s;byterians who &s;poke otherwi&s;e. Be|&s;ides, I well &s;aw, no one could (in the nature of things) have &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of forgivene&s;s, and not <HI>feel</HI> it. But I felt it not. If then there was no faith without this, all my preten&s;ions to faith dropped at once.</P>
<P N="12">12. When I met Peter Bohler again, he con&s;ented, to put the di&s;pute upon the i&s;&s;ue which I de&s;ired, viz. Scripture and experience. I fir&s;t con&s;ulted the &s;crip|ture. But when I &s;et a&s;ide the glo&s;&s;es of men, and &s;imply con&s;idered the word of God, comparing them together, endeavouring to illu&s;trate the ob&s;cure by the plainer pa&s;&s;ages, I found they all made again&s;t me, and was forced to retreat to my la&s;t hold, "That experience would never agree with the <HI>literal interpreta|tion</HI> of tho&s;e &s;criptures. Nor could I therefore allow it to be true, till I found &s;ome living witne&s;&s;es of it." He replied, "He could &s;hew me &s;uch at any time; if I de&s;ired it the next day." And accordingly the next day, he came again with three others, all of whom te&s;tified of their own per&s;onal experience, that a true living faith in Chri&s;t, is in&s;eparable from a &s;ea&s;e of pardon for all pa&s;t, and freedom from all pre&s;ent &s;ins. They added with one mouth, that this faith was the gift, the free gift of God, and that he would &s;urely be&s;tow it upon every &s;oul, who earne&s;tly and per&s;everingly &s;ought it. I was now throughly con|vinced; and by the grace of God, I re&s;olved to &s;eek it unto the end, 1. By ab&s;olutely renouncing all de|pendence, in whole or in part, upon <HI>my own</HI> works or righteou&s;ne&s;s, on which I had really grounded my hope of &s;alvation, though I knew it not, from my youth up. 2. By adding to <HI>the con&s;tant u&s;e of all the other means of grace,</HI> continual prayer for this very thing, ju&s;tifying, &s;aving faith, a full reliance on the blood of

<P N="13">13. I continued thus to &s;eek it (though with &s;trange indifference, dulne&s;s and coldne&s;s, and u&s;ually frequent relap&s;es into &s;in) till Wedne&s;day, May 24. I think it was about five this morning, that I opened my Te&s;tament on tho&s;e words. <GAP DESC="foreign">. <HI>There are given unto us exceeding great and precious pro|mi&s;es, even that ye &s;hould be partakers of the divine na|ture.</HI> 2 Pet. i. 4. Ju&s;t as I went out, I opened it again on tho&s;e words, <HI>Thou art not far from the king|dom of God.</HI> In the afternoon I was a&s;ked to go to St. Paul's. The anthem was, <HI>Out of the deep have I called unto thee, O Lord: Lord hear my voice. O let thine ears con&s;ider well the voice of my complaint. If thou, Lord, wilt be extreme to mark what is done ami&s;s, O Lord, who may abide it? But there is mercy with thee; therefore thou &s;halt be feared. O I&s;rael, tru&s;t in the Lord: for with the Lord there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption. And he &s;hall redeem I&s;rael from all his &s;ins</HI></P>
<P N="14">14 In the evening I went very unwillingly to a &s;ociety in Alder&s;gate-&s;treet, where one was reading Luther's preface to the epi&s;tle to the Romans. About a quarter before nine, while he was de&s;cribing the change which God works in the heart through faith in Chri&s;t, I felt my heart &s;trangely warmed. I felt I did tru&s;t in Chri&s;t, Chri&s;t alone for &s;alvation: and an a&s;&s;urance was given me, that he had taken away <HI>my</HI> &s;ins, even <HI>mine,</HI> and &s;aved <HI>me</HI> from the law of &s;in and death.</P>
<P N="15">15. I began to pray with all my might for tho&s;e who had in a more e&s;pecial manner de&s;pitefully u&s;ed me and per&s;ecuted me. I then te&s;tified openly to all there, what I now fir&s;t felt in my heart. But it was not long before the enemy &s;ugge&s;ted, "This cannot
<PB N="136" REF="029861_0134_0FE2AA0A46934DC8">be faith; for where is thy joy?" Then was I taught, that <HI>peace and victory over &s;in, are e&s;&s;ential to faith in the Captain of our &s;alvation: but, that as to the tran&s;ports of joy</HI> that u&s;ually attend the beginning of it, e&s;pe|cially in tho&s;e who have mourned deeply, <HI>God &s;ome|times giveth, &s;ometimes with-holdeth them, according to the coun&s;els of his own will.</HI></P>
<P N="16">16. After my return home, I was much buffeted with temptations: but cried out, and they fled away. They returned again and again. I as often lifted up my eyes, and he <HI>&s;ent me help from his holy place.</HI> And herein I found the difference between this and my former &s;tate chiefly con&s;i&s;ted. I was &s;triving, yea, fighting with all my might under the law, as well as under grace. But then I was &s;ometimes, if not often, conquered; now, I was always conqueror.</P>
<P N="17">17. Thur&s;. May 25. The moment I awaked, "Je&s;us, Ma&s;ter," was in my heart and in my mouth; and I found all my &s;trength lay in keeping my eye &s;ixed upon him, and my &s;oul waiting on him continually. Being again at St. Paul's in the afternoon, I could ta&s;te the good word of God in the anthem, which be|gan, <HI>My &s;ong &s;hall be always of the loving-kindne&s;s of the Lord: with my mouth will I ever be &s;hewing forth thy truth from one generation to another.</HI> Yet the enemy injected a fear, "If thou do&s;t believe, why is there not a more &s;en&s;ible change? I an&s;wered (yet not I) that I know not. But this I know, I have <HI>now peace with God.</HI> And <HI>I &s;in not to day,</HI> and Je&s;us my Ma&s;ter has forbid me to take thought for the mor|row."</P>
<P N="18">18. "But is not <HI>any</HI> &s;ort of <HI>fear</HI> (continued the tempter) a proof that thou do&s;t not believe?" I de|&s;ired my ma&s;ter to an&s;wer for me; and opened his book upon tho&s;e words of St. Paul. <HI>Without were fightings, within were fears.</HI> Then inferred I, well may
<PB N="137" REF="029861_0135_0FE2AA0BD8382A30">fears be within <HI>me;</HI> but I mu&s;t go on, and tread them under my feet.</P>
<P>Friday, May 26. My &s;oul continued in peace, but yet in heavine&s;s, becau&s;e of manifold temptations. I a&s;ked Mr. Telching the Moravian, What to do? He &s;aid you mu&s;t not fight with them, as you did be|fore, but flee from them, the moment they appear, and take &s;helter in the wounds of Je&s;us. The &s;ame I learned al&s;o from the afternoon anthem, which was, <HI>My &s;oul truly waiteth &s;till upon God, for of him com|eth my &s;alvation; he verily is my &s;trength and my &s;alva|tion, he is my defence &s;o that I &s;hall not greatly fall. O put your tru&s;t in him always, ye people; pour out your hearts before him; for God is our hope.</HI></P>
<P>Sat. 27. Believing one rea&s;on of my want of joy, was want of time for prayer, I re&s;olved to do no bu&s;ine&s;s till I went to church in the morning, but to continue pouring out my heart before him. And this day my &s;pirit was enlarged; &s;o that though I was now al&s;o a&s;&s;aulted by many temptations, I was more than conqueror, gaining more power thereby to tru&s;t and rejoice in God my Saviour.</P>
<P>Sunday 28. I waked in peace, but not in joy. In the &s;ame even quiet &s;tate I was till the evening, when I was roughly attacked in a large company as an en|thu&s;ia&s;t, a &s;educer, and a &s;etter forth of new doc|trines. By the ble&s;&s;ing of God I was not moved to anger, but after a calm and &s;hort reply went away; though not with &s;o tender concern as was due to tho&s;e, who were &s;eeking death in the error of their life.</P>
<P>This day I preached in the morning at St. George's Bloom&s;bury, on, <HI>This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith;</HI> and in the afternoon at the chapel in Long-Acre, on God's ju&s;tifying the ungod|ly; the la&s;t time (I under&s;tand) I am to preach at either. <HI>Not as I will, but as thou wilt.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="029861_0136_0FE2AA0D65FA59E0">
Mond. 29 I &s;et out for Dummer with Mr. Wolf, one of the fir&s;t-fruits of Peter Bohler's mini&s;try in England. I was much &s;trengthened by the grace of God in him: yet was his &s;tate &s;o far above mine, that I was often tempted to doubt, whether we had one faith? But, without much rea&s;oning about it, I held here; "Though his be <HI>&s;trong</HI> and mine <HI>weak,</HI> yet that God hath given &s;ome <HI>degree</HI> of faith even to me, I know by its fruits. For I have <HI>con&s;tant peace;</HI> not one unea&s;y thought. And I have <HI>freedom from &s;in:</HI> not one unholy de&s;ire."</P>
<P>Yet on Wedne&s;day did I grieve the Spirit of God, not only by not <HI>watching unto prayer,</HI> but likewi&s;e by &s;peaking with &s;harpne&s;s in&s;tead of tender love, of one that was not &s;ound in the faith. Immediately God hid his face and I was troubled; and in this heavine&s;s I continued till the next morning, June 1. When it plea&s;ed God, while I was exhorting another, to give comfort to my &s;oul, and (after I had &s;pent &s;ome time in prayer) to direct me to tho&s;e gracious words, <HI>Having therefore boldne&s;s to enter into the holie&s;t by the blood of Je&s;us&mdash;Let us draw near with a true heart, in full a&s;&s;urance of faith. Let us hold fa&s;t the profe&s;&s;ion of our faith without wavering; (for he is faith|ful that promi&s;ed) and let us con&s;ider one another, to pro|voke unto love and to good works.</HI></P>
<P>Sat. June 3. I was &s;o &s;trongly a&s;&s;aulted by one of my old enemies, that I had &s;carce &s;trength to open my lips, or even to look up for help. But after I had prayed, faintly, as I could, the temptation vani&s;h|ed away.</P>
<P>Sun. 4. Was indeed a fea&s;t-day. For from the time of my ri&s;ing till pa&s;t one in the afternoon, I was praying, reading the &s;criptures, &s;inging prai&s;e, or calling &s;inners to repentance. All the&s;e days I &s;carce remember to have opened the te&s;tament, but upon &s;ome great and precious promi&s;e. And I &s;aw more
<PB N="139" REF="029861_0137_0FE2AA0EF3503EE8">than ever, that the go&s;pel, is in truth but one great promi&s;e, from the beginning of it to the end.</P>
<P>Tue&s;. 6. I had &s;till more comfort, and peace, and joy: on which I fear I began to pre&s;ume. For in the evening I received a letter from Oxford which threw me into much perplexity. It was a&s;&s;erted there|in, "That no doubting could con&s;i&s;t with the lea&s;t degree of true faith: that whoever at any time felt any doubt or fear, was not <HI>weak in faith,</HI> but had <HI>no faith</HI> at all: and that none hath any faith, till the law of the &s;pirit of life has made him <HI>wholly</HI> free from the law of &s;in and death."</P>
<P>Begging of God to direct me, I opened my te&s;ta|ment on 1 Cor. iii. ver. 1, &amp;c. where St. Paul &s;peaks of tho&s;e whom he terms <HI>babes</HI> in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> who were <HI>not able to bear &s;trong meat,</HI> nay (in a &s;en&s;e) <HI>car|nal;</HI> to whom neverthele&s;s he &s;ays, <HI>Ye are God's build|ing, ye are the temple of God.</HI> Surely then the&s;e men had <HI>&s;ome degree</HI> of faith; though it is plain, their faith was but <HI>weak.</HI></P>
<P>After &s;ome hours &s;pent in the &s;cripture and prayer, I was much comforted. Yet I felt a kind of fore|ne&s;s in my heart, &s;o that I found my wound was not fully healed. O God, &s;ave thou me, and all that are <HI>weak in the faith,</HI> from <HI>doubtful di&s;putations!</HI></P>
<P>Wedne&s;day, June 7. I determined, if God &s;hould permit, to retire for a &s;hort time into Germany. I had fully propo&s;ed before I left Georgia &s;o to do, if it &s;hould plea&s;e God to bring me back to Europe. And I now clearly &s;aw the time was come. My weak mind could not bear to be thus &s;awn a&s;under. And I hoped the conver&s;ing with the&s;e holy men, who were them&s;elves living witne&s;&s;es of the full pow|er of faith, and yet able to bear with tho&s;e that are weak, would be a means, under God, of &s;o e&s;tabli&s;h|ing my &s;oul, that I might <HI>go on from faith to faith, and from &s;trength to &s;trength.</HI></P>

Thur&s;. 8. I went to Sali&s;bury to take leave of my mother. The next day I left Sarum, and on Saturday came to Stanton-harcourt. Having preach|ed faith in Chri&s;t there on Sunday 11, I went on to Oxford; and thence on Monday to London, where I found Mr. Ingham ju&s;t &s;etting out. We went on board the next day, Tue&s;day 13, and fell down to Grave&s;end that night. About four in the afternoon on Wedne&s;day we lo&s;t &s;ight of England. We reach|ed the Mea&s;e at eight on Thur&s;day morning, and in an hour and a half landed at Rotterdam.</P>
<P>We were eight in all, five Engli&s;h and three Ger|mans. Dr. Koker, a phy&s;ician of Rotterdam, was &s;o kind, when we &s;et forward in the afternoon, as to walk an hour with us on our way. I never before &s;aw any &s;uch road as this. For many miles together, it is rai&s;ed for &s;ome yards above the level, and paved with a &s;mall &s;ort of brick, as &s;mooth and clean as the Mall in St. James's. The walnut-trees &s;tand in even rows on either &s;ide: &s;o that no walk in a gentle|man's garden is plea&s;anter. About &s;even we came to Goudart, where we were a little &s;urprized, at meet|ing with a treatment which is not heard of in Eng|land. Several inns utterly refu&s;ed to entertain us; &s;o that it was with difficulty we at la&s;t found one, where they did us the favour to take our money for &s;ome meat and drink, and the u&s;e of two or three bad b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.

Here we were at Baron Wattevil's, as at home. We found with him a few German brethren and &s;i&s;ters, and &s;even or eight of our Engli&s;h acquaint|ance, who had &s;ettled here &s;ome time before. They lodged ju&s;t without the town, in three or four little hou&s;es, till one &s;hould be built that would contain them all. Saturday 17, was their interce&s;&s;ion-day. In the morning, &s;ome of our Engli&s;h brethren de&s;ired me to admini&s;ter the Lord's &s;upper: the re&s;t of the day was &s;pent with all the brethren and &s;i&s;ters, in hearing the wonderful work which God is beginning to work over all the earth, and in making our reque&s;ts known unto him, and giving him thanks for the mightine&s;s of his kingdom.</P>
<P>At &s;ix in the morning we took boat. The beauti|ful gardens lie on both &s;ides the river, for great part of the way to Am&s;terdam, whither we came about five in the evening. The exact neatne&s;s of all the buildings here, the nice cleanne&s;s of the &s;treets (which, we were informed, were all wa&s;hed twice a week) and the canals which run through all the main &s;treets, with rows of trees on either &s;ide, make this the plea&s;ante&s;t city which I have ever &s;een. Here we were entertained with truly Chri&s;tian ho&s;pitality, by Mr. Decknatel, a mini&s;ter of the Mennoni&s;ts, who &s;uffered us to want nothing while we &s;tayed here, which was till the Thur&s;day following. Dr. Bark|hau&s;en (a phy&s;ician, a Mu&s;covite by nation) who had been with Mr. Decknatel for &s;ome time, &s;hewed us likewi&s;e all po&s;&s;ible kindne&s;s. <HI>Remember them, O Lord, for good!</HI></P>
<P>Mond. 17. I was at one of the &s;ocieties, which la&s;ted an hour and an half. About &s;ixty per&s;ons were pre&s;ent. The &s;inging was in Low-Dutch (Mr. Decknatel having tran&s;lated into Low-Dutch, part of the Hernhuth hymn-book) but the words were &s;o very near the German, that any who under&s;tood
<PB N="142" REF="029861_0140_0FE2AA1DD96E1DD8">the original, might under&s;tand the tran&s;lation. The expounding was in High Dutch. I was at another of the &s;ocieties on Tue&s;day, where were pre&s;ent about the &s;ame number. On Wedne&s;day, one of our com|pany found a &s;heep that had been lo&s;t: his &s;i&s;ter, who had lived here for &s;ome time with one whom &s;he loved too well, as he did her. But they were now both re&s;olved, by the grace of God (which they accord|ingly executed without delay) <HI>To pluck out the right eye, and ca&s;t it from them.</HI></P>
<P>Thur&s;. 22.

A little before eight we came to Beurn, a &s;mall ill-built city, belonging to the Prince of Orange. Setting out early in the morn|ing, we came to Nimwegen, the la&s;t town in Holland, about two in the afternoon: and leaving it at four, came before eight to an inn, two hours &s;hort of Cleve.</P>
<P>Sun. 25. After &s;pending an hour in &s;inging and prayer, we walked till near noon, before we could meet with any refre&s;hment. The road would have ap|peared exceeding plea&s;ant, being broad and &s;trait, with tall trees on either &s;ide, had not wearine&s;s and rain prevented. We hoped to reach Reinberg in the evening, but could not; being obliged to &s;top two hours &s;hort of it, at a little hou&s;e, where many good Lutherans were concluding the Lord's-day (as is u&s;ual among them) with fiddling and dancing!</P>
<P>Mond. 26. We breakfa&s;ted at Reinberg, left it at half an hour pa&s;t ten, and at four came to Urding. Being much tired, we re&s;ted here, &s;o that it was near ten at night before we came to Neus.

Wedne&s;. 28. We went to the cathedral, which is mere heaps upon heaps; a huge, mi&s;hapen thing, which has no more of &s;ymmetry, than of neatne&s;s be|longing to it. I was a little &s;urprized to ob&s;erve, that neither in this, nor in any other of the Romi&s;h churches where I have been, is there, properly &s;peaking any &s;uch thing as joint wor&s;hip: but one prays at one &s;hrine or altar, and another at another, without any regard to, or communication with one another. As we came out of the church, a proce&s;&s;ion began on the other &s;ide of the church-yard. One of our company &s;crupling to pull off his hat, a zealous Catholic pre|&s;ently cried out, <HI>Knock down the Lutheran dog.</HI> But we prevented any conte&s;t, by retiring into the church.</P>
<P>Walking on the &s;ide of the Rhine in the afternoon, I &s;aw to my great &s;urprize (for I always thought before, no Romani&s;t of any fa&s;hion believed any thing of the &s;tory) a fre&s;h painting, done la&s;t year at the public expence, on the out&s;ide of the city wall, <HI>in memory of the bringing in the heads of the three kings</HI> (&s;ays the Latin in&s;cription) <HI>through the gate adjoining:</HI> which indeed, in reverence (it &s;eems) to them, has been &s;topped up ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>At four we took boat, when I could not but ob|&s;erve the decency of the Papi&s;ts, above us who are called reformed. As &s;oon as ever we were &s;eated (and &s;o every morning after) they all pulled off their hats, and each u&s;ed by him&s;elf, a &s;hort prayer for our pro&s;|perous journey. And this ju&s;tice I mu&s;t do to the very boatmen (who upon the Rhine are generally wicked even to a proverb) I never heard one of them take the name of God in vain, or &s;aw any one laugh when any thing of religion was mentioned. So that I be|lieve the glory of <HI>&s;porting with &s;acred things,</HI> is peculiar to the Engli&s;h nation!</P>
<P>We were four nights on the water, by rea&s;on of the &s;wiftne&s;s of the &s;tream, up which the boat was drawn

On Sunday evening, July 2, we came to Mentz; and Monday the 3d, at half an hour pa&s;t ten, to Frank|fort.</P>
<P>Faint and weary as we were, we could have no admittance here, having brought no pa&s;&s;es with us, which indeed we never imagined would have been re|quired, in a time of &s;ettled general peace. After waiting an hour at the gates, we procured a me&s;&s;enger, whom we &s;ent to Mr. Bohler (Peter Bohler's father) who immediately came, procured us entrance into the city, and entertained us in the mo&s;t friendly manner. We &s;et out early in the morning on Tue&s;day the 4th, and about one came to Marienborn. But I was &s;o ill, that after talking a little with Count Zinzendorf, I was forced to lie down the re&s;t of the day.</P>
<P>The family at Marienborn con&s;i&s;ts of about ninety per&s;ons, gathered out of many nations. They live for the pre&s;ent in a large hou&s;e hired by the Count, which is capable of receiving a far greater number; but are building one, about three (Engli&s;h) miles off, on the top of a fruitful hill. <HI>O how plea&s;ant a thing it is, for brethren to dwell together in unity!</HI></P>
<P>Thur&s;. 6. The Count carried me with him to the Count of Solmes, where I ob&s;erved with plea&s;ure the German frugality. Three of the young Counte&s;&s;es (though grown up) were dre&s;t in linen; the Count and his &s;on in plain cloth. At dinner, the next day, a gla&s;s of wine and a gla&s;s of water were &s;et by every one, and if either were emptied, a &s;econd. They all conver&s;ed freely and unaffectedly. At ten at night we took coach again, and in the morning reached Marienborn.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="029861_0143_0FE2AA295F08A808">
I lodged with one of the brethren at Ecker&s;hau&s;en, an Engli&s;h mile from Marienborn, where I u&s;ually &s;pent the day, chiefly in conver&s;ing with tho&s;e who could &s;peak either Latin or Engli&s;h; not being able, for want of more practice, to &s;peak German readily. And here I continually met with what I &s;ought for, viz. Living proofs of the power of faith: per&s;ons <HI>&s;aved from</HI> inward as well as outward <HI>&s;in, by the love of God &s;hed abroad in their hearts;</HI> and from all doubt and fear, by the abiding <HI>witne&s;s of the Holy Gho&s;t given unto them.</HI></P>
<P>Sund. 9. The Count preached in the old ca&s;tle at Runneberg (about three Engli&s;h miles from Marien|born) where is al&s;o a &s;mall company of tho&s;e who &s;eek the Lord Je&s;us in &s;incerity. Wedne&s;day 12, was one of the conferences for &s;trangers; where one of Frankfort propo&s;ing the que&s;tion, Can a man be ju&s;tifi|ed and not know it? The Count &s;poke largely and &s;cripturally upon it to this effect:</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Ju&s;tification is, the forgivene&s;s of &s;ins.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The moment a man flies to Chri&s;t he is ju&s;ti|fied:</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. And has peace with God, but not always joy:</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Nor perhaps may he know he is ju&s;tified, till long after.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. For the a&s;&s;urance of it is di&s;tinct from ju&s;tification it&s;elf.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. But others may know he is ju&s;tified by his pow|er over &s;in, by his &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, his love of the brethren, and his <HI>hunger and thir&s;t after righteou&s;ne&s;s, which alone prove the &s;piritual life to be begun.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>7. To be ju&s;tified is the &s;ame thing as to be born of God. (Not &s;o.)</ITEM>

I then recollected what Peter Bohler had often &s;aid upon this head, which was to this effect:</P>

<P>Sat. 15. Was the interce&s;&s;ion day, when many &s;trangers were pre&s;ent from different parts. On Mon|day 17, having &s;tayed here ten days longer than I in|tended (my fir&s;t de&s;ign being only to re&s;t one or two days) I propo&s;ed &s;etting out for Hernhuth; but Mr. Ingham de&s;iring me to &s;tay a little longer, I &s;tayed till Wedne&s;day 19, when Mr. Hauptman (a native of Dre&s;den) Mr. Brown and I &s;et out together.</P>
<P>We breakfa&s;ted at Gehlenhau&s;en, an old, unhand|&s;ome town, dined at Offenau (where is a &s;trange in|&s;tance of moderation, a church u&s;ed every Sunday, both by the Papi&s;ts and the Lutherans alternately) and notwith&s;tanding &s;ome &s;harp &s;howers of rain, in the evening reached Steinau. Thur&s;day 20 we dined at Braun&s;al, and pa&s;&s;ing through Fulda in the after|noon (where the Duke has a plea&s;ant palace) travelled through a delightful country of hills and vales, and in the evening came to Rickher&s;ch. The next night (after having had the mo&s;t beautiful pro&s;pect which I think I ever &s;aw, from the top of a high hill, commanding a va&s;t extent of various land on every &s;ide) we, with &s;ome difficulty, and many words, pro|cured a poor accommodation at an inn in Mark&s;ul. Saturday 22, having pa&s;&s;ed through El&s;enach in the morning, we came through a more level open country, to Saxe-Gotha in the afternoon, a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and plea&s;ant
<PB N="147" REF="029861_0145_0FE2AA2C83CAF280">city, in which the Prince's palace is indeed a fine building. We &s;topped an hour here with a friendly man, and in the evening came to Ditleben; and thence in the morning to Erfurt, where we were kindly en|tertained by Mr. Reinhurt, to whom we were directed by &s;ome of the brethren at Marienborn. In the af|ternoon we came to Weymar, where we had more difficulty to get through the city than is u&s;ual, even in Germany: being not only detained a con&s;iderable time at the gate, but al&s;o carried before I know not what great man (I believe, the Duke) in the &s;quare: who after many other que&s;tions, a&s;ked, What we were going &s;o far as Hernhuth for? I an&s;wered, "To &s;ee the place where the Chri&s;tians live." He looked hard, and let us go.</P>
<P>Mond. 24. We came early to Jena, which lies at the bottom of &s;everal high, &s;teep, barren hills. The &s;tudents here are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the town&s;men by their &s;words. They do not live together in colleges (nor indeed in any of the German univer&s;ities) as we do in Oxford and Cambridge; but are &s;cattered up and down the town; in lodging or boarding-hou&s;es. Tho&s;e of them to whom we were recommended, be|haved as brethren indeed. O may brotherly kind|ne&s;s, and every good word and work, abound in them more and more!</P>
<P>At Jena the &s;tone pillars begin, &s;et up by the Elector of Saxony, and marking out every quarter of a German mile, to the end of his Electorate. Every mile is a large pillar, with the names of the neigh|bouring towns, and their di&s;tances in&s;cribed. It were much to be wi&s;hed, that the &s;ame care were taken in England, and indeed in all countries.</P>
<P>We left Jena early on Tue&s;day, reached Wei&s;en|feltz in the evening, and Mer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eberg on Wedne&s;day morning. Having a de&s;ire to &s;ee Halle (two Ger|man miles off) we &s;et out after breakfa&s;t, and came
<PB N="148" REF="029861_0146_0FE2AA3560D983F0">thither at two in the afternoon. But we could not be admitted into the town, when we came. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia's tall men, who kept the gates, &s;ent us backward and forward, from one gate to another, for near two hours. I then thought of &s;ending in a note to profe&s;&s;or Francke, the &s;on of that Augu&s;t Herman Francke, who&s;e name, is indeed as precious ointment. O may I follow him, as he did Chri&s;t! And <HI>by manife&s;ta|tion of the truth, commend my&s;elf to every man's con&s;cience in the &s;ight of God!</HI></P>
<P>He was not in town. However we were at length admitted into the orphan-hou&s;e, that amazing proof, that <HI>all things are</HI> &s;till <HI>po&s;&s;ible to him that believeth.</HI> There is now a large yearly revenue for its &s;upport, be&s;ide what is continually brought in by the Printing office, the books &s;old there, and the apothecary's &s;hop, which is furni&s;hed with all &s;orts of medicines. The building reaches backward from the front is two wings, for, I believe, a hundred and fifty yards. The lodging-chambers for the children, their dining room, their chapel, and all the adjoining apartments, are &s;o conveniently contrived, and &s;o exactly clean, as I have never &s;een any before. Six hundred and fifty children (we were informed) are wholly maintained there, and three thou&s;and (if I mi&s;take not) taught. Surely &s;uch a thing neither we nor our fathers have known, as this great thing which God has done here!</P>
<P>Thur&s;day 27. We returned to Mer&s;eberg, and at five in the evening came to the gates of Leip&s;ig. After we had &s;ent in our pa&s;s, and waited an hour and an half, we were &s;uffered to go to a bad inn in the town.</P>
<P>Friday 28. We found out Mr. Mer&s;chall, and the other gentlemen of the univer&s;ity, to whom we were directed. They were not wanting in any good office while we &s;tayed, and in the afternoon went with us an hour forward in our journey.</P>

After a plea&s;ant walk on Saturday, on Sunday 30, about &s;even in the morning, we came to Mei&s;&s;en. In Mei&s;&s;en-Ca&s;tle, the German china-ware is made, which is full as dear as that imported from the Indies; and as finely &s;haped, and beautifully coloured, as any I have ever &s;een. After breakfa&s;t we went to church. I was greatly &s;urprized at all I &s;aw there: at the co&s;tline&s;s of apparel in many, and the gaudine&s;s of it in more; at the huge fur caps worn by the women, of the &s;ame &s;hope with a Turki&s;h turban; which generally had one or more ribbands hanging down a great length behind. The mini&s;ter's habit was adorn|ed with gold and &s;carlet, and a va&s;t cro&s;s both be|hind and before. Mo&s;t of the congregation &s;at (the men generally with their hats on, at the prayers as well as &s;ermon) and all of them &s;tayed, during the holy communion, tho' but very few received. Alas, alas! what a <HI>reformed</HI> country is this!</P>
<P>At two in the afternoon we came to Dre&s;den, the chief city of Saxony. Here al&s;o we were carried for above two hours from one magi&s;trate or officer to another, with the u&s;ual impertinent &s;olemnity, be|fore we were &s;uffered to go to our inn. I greatly wonder that common &s;en&s;e and common humanity (for the&s;e doubtle&s;s &s;ub&s;i&s;t in Germany as well as England) do not put an end to this &s;en&s;ele&s;s, in|human u&s;age of &s;trangers, which we met with at al|mo&s;t every German city, tho' more particularly at Frankfort, Weymar, Halle, Leip&s;ig and Dre&s;den. I know nothing that can rea&s;onably be &s;aid in its de|fence, in a time of full peace, being a breach of all the common, even heathen laws of ho&s;pitality. If it is a cu&s;tom, &s;o much the wor&s;e; the more is the pity and the &s;hame.</P>
<P>In the evening we &s;aw the palace the late elector was building, when God called him away. The &s;tone-work he had very near fini&s;hed, and &s;ome of the
<PB N="150" REF="029861_0148_0FE2AA3888AC7198">apartments within. It is a beautiful and magnificent de&s;ign; but all is now &s;wiftly running to ruin. The new church on the out&s;ide re&s;embles a theatre. It is eight &s;quare, built of fine free-&s;tone. We were de|&s;ired al&s;o to take notice of the great bridge which joins the new with the old town; of the large, bra&s;s crucifix upon it, generally admired for the workman|&s;hip; and of the late king Augu&s;tus's &s;tatue on hor&s;e|back, which is at a &s;mall di&s;tance from it. Alas! Where will all the&s;e things appear, when <HI>the earth and the works thereof &s;hall be burnt up?</HI></P>
<P>Between five and &s;ix the next evening (having left Mr. Hauptman with his relations in Dre&s;den) we came to Neu&s;tadt, but could not procure any lodging in the city. After walking half an hour, we came to another little town, and found a &s;ort of an inn there: but they told us plainly, <HI>we &s;hould have no lodging with them; for they did not like our looks.</HI></P>
<P>About eight we were received at a little hou&s;e in another village, where God gave us &s;weet re&s;t.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day, Augu&s;t 1, At three in the afternoon, I came to Hernhuth, about thirty Engli&s;h miles from Dre&s;den. It lies in Upper-Lu&s;atia, on the borders of Bohemia, and contains about an hundred hou&s;es, built on a ri&s;ing ground, with evergreen woods on two &s;ides, gardens and corn-fields on the others, and high hills at a &s;mall di&s;tance. It has one long &s;treet, through which the great road from Zittan to Lobau goes. Fronting the middle of this &s;treet is the or|phan-hou&s;e; in the lower part of which is the apothe|cary's &s;hop, in the upper, the chapel, capable of con|taining &s;ix or &s;even hundred people. Another row of hou&s;es runs at a &s;mall di&s;tance from either end of the orphan-hou&s;e, which accordingly divides the re&s;t of the town (be&s;ide the long &s;treet) into two &s;quares. At the ca&s;t end of it is the Count's hou&s;e, a &s;mall, plain building like the re&s;t: having a large garden behind
<PB N="151" REF="029861_0149_0FE2AA3A1841AFB0">it, well laid out, not for &s;how, but for the u&s;e of the community.</P>
<P>We had a convenient lodging a&s;&s;igned us in the hou&s;e appointed for &s;trangers: and I had now abund|ant opportunity, of ob&s;erving whether what I had heard was enlarged by the relators, or was neither more nor le&s;s than the naked truth.</P>
<P>I rejoiced to find Mr. Herm&s;dorf here, whom I had &s;o often conver&s;ed with in Georgia. And there was nothing in his power which he did not do, to make our &s;tay here u&s;eful and agreeable. About eight we went to the public &s;ervice, at which they frequently u&s;e other in&s;truments with their organ. They began (as u&s;ual) with &s;inging. Then follow|ed the expounding, clo&s;ed by a &s;econd hymn: prayer followed this; and then a few ver&s;es of a third hymn; which concluded the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day 2. At four in the afternoon was a love-fea&s;t of the married men, taking their food with gladne&s;s and &s;inglene&s;s of heart, and with the voice of prai&s;e and thank&s;giving.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day 3. (and &s;o every day at eleven) I was at the bible conference, wherein Mr. Miller (late ma&s;ter of a great &s;chool in Zittau, till he left all to follow Chri&s;t) and &s;everal others, read together, as u&s;ual, a portion of &s;cripture in the original. At five was the conference for &s;trangers, when &s;everal que&s;tions concerning ju&s;tification were re&s;olved. This evening Chri&s;tian David came hither. O may God make him a me&s;&s;enger of glad tidings.</P>
<P>On Friday and Saturday (and &s;o every day in the following week) I had much conver&s;ation with the mo&s;t experienced of the brethren, concerning the great work which God had wrought in their &s;ouls, purify|ing them by faith: and with Martin Dober, and the other teachers and elders of the church, concerning the di&s;cipline u&s;ed therein.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="029861_0150_0FE2AA401C473648">
Sund. 6. We went to church at <HI>Berthold&s;dorf,</HI> a Lutheran village about an Engli&s;h mile from <HI>Hern|huth.</HI> Two large candles &s;tood lighted upon the al|tar: the la&s;t &s;upper was painted behind it; the pul|pit was placed over it, and over that, a bra&s;s image of Chri&s;t on the cro&s;s.</P>
<P>The mini&s;ter had on a &s;ort of pudding-&s;leeve gown, which covered him all round. At nine began a long voluntary on the organ, clo&s;ed with a hymn, which was &s;ung by all the people &s;itting (in which po&s;ture, as is the German cu&s;tom, they &s;ung all that followed.) Then the mini&s;ter walked up to the altar, bowed; &s;ung the&s;e latin words, <HI>Gloria in excel&s;is Deo;</HI> bowed again and went away. This was followed by another hymn, &s;ung as before, to the organ by all the people. Then the mini&s;ter went to the altar again, bowed, &s;ung a prayer, read the epi&s;tle and went away. Af|ter a third hymn was &s;ung, he went a third time to the altar, &s;ung a ver&s;icle (to which all the people &s;ung a re&s;pon&s;e) read the third chapter to the Ro|mans, and went away. The people having then &s;ung the creed in rhyme, he came and read the go&s;pel, all &s;tanding. Another hymn followed, which being end|ed, the mini&s;ter in the pulpit u&s;ed a long extemporary prayer, and afterwards preached an hour and a quar|ter on a ver&s;e of the go&s;pel. Then he read a long in|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rce&s;&s;ion and general thank&s;giving, which before twelve concluded the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>After the evening &s;ervice at Hernhuth was ended, all the unmarried men (as is their cu&s;tom) walked quite round the town, &s;inging prai&s;e with in&s;truments of mu&s;ic; and then on a &s;mall hill, at a little di&s;tance from it, ca&s;ting them&s;elves into a ring, joined in prayer. Thence they returned into the great &s;quare, and a little after eleven, commended each other to God.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="029861_0151_0FE2AA427813B680">
Tue&s;day 8. A child was buried. The burying ground (called by them Gottes Acker, i. e. God's ground) lies a few hundred yards out of the town, under the &s;ide of a little wood. There are di&s;tinct &s;quares in it for married men and unmarried; for married and unmarried women; for male and female children, and for widows. The corp&s;e was carried from the chapel, the children walking fir&s;t: next the Orphan-father (&s;o they call him who has the chief care of the Orphan-hou&s;e) with the mini&s;ter of Ber|thold&s;dorf: then four children bearing the corp&s;e, and after them, Martin Dober and the father of the child. Then followed the men, and la&s;t of all the women and girls. They all &s;ung as they went. Be|ing come into the &s;quare where the male-children are buried, the men &s;tood on two &s;ides of it, the boys on the third, and the women and girls on the fourth. There they &s;ung again: after which the mini&s;ter u&s;ed (I think read) a &s;hort prayer, and concluded with that ble&s;&s;ing, <HI>"Unto God's gracious mercy and protec|tion I commit you."</HI></P>
<P>Seeing the father (a plain man, a taylor by trade) looking at the grave, I a&s;ked, "How do you find your&s;elf?" He &s;aid, "Prai&s;ed be the Lord, never better. He has taken the &s;oul of my child to him&s;elf. I have &s;een, according to my de&s;ire, his body com|mitted to holy ground. And I know that when it is rai&s;ed again, both he and I &s;hall ever be with the Lord."</P>
<P>Several evenings this week I was with one or other of the private bands. On Wedne&s;day and Thur&s;day I had an opportunity of talking with Michael Linner, the elde&s;t of the church, and largely with Chri&s;tian David, who, under God, was the fir&s;t planter of it.</P>
<P>Four times al&s;o I enjoyed the ble&s;&s;ing of hearing him preach, during the few days I &s;pent here: and every time he cho&s;e the very &s;ubject which I &s;hould
<PB N="154" REF="029861_0152_0FE2AA440B1B6DF8">have de&s;ired, had I &s;poken to him before. Thrice he de&s;cribed the &s;tate of tho&s;e who are <HI>weak in &s;aith,</HI> who are ju&s;tified, but have not yet a new, clean heart; who have received forgivene&s;s through the blood of Chri&s;t, but have not received the con&s;tant indwelling of the Holy Gho&s;t. This &s;tate he explained once, from, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are the poor in &s;pirit; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven;</HI> when he &s;hewed at large from va|rious &s;criptures, that many are children of God and heirs of the promi&s;es, long before their hearts are &s;oftened by holy mourning, before they are <HI>comforted</HI> by the abiding witne&s;s of the Spirit, melting their &s;ouls into all gentlene&s;s and <HI>meekne&s;s;</HI> and much more, before they are renewed in all that <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> which they <HI>hungered and thir&s;ted</HI> after, before they are <HI>&s;ure in heart</HI> from all &s;elf-will and &s;in, and <HI>merciful</HI> as their Father which is in heaven is merciful.</P>
<P>A &s;econd time he pointed out this &s;tate from tho&s;e words, <HI>Who &s;hall deliver me from the body of this death! I thank God, Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord. There is there|fore no condemnation to them which are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> Hence al&s;o he at large both proved the exi&s;tence, and &s;hewed the nature of that intermediate &s;tate, which mo&s;t experience between that bondage which is de|&s;cribed in the 7th chapter of the epi&s;tle to the Ro|mans, and the full glorious liberty of the children of God, de&s;cribed in the eighth and in many oth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> parts of &s;cripture.</P>
<P>This he yet again explained from the &s;criptures which de&s;cribe the &s;tate the apo&s;tles were in, from our Lord's death (and indeed for &s;ome time before) till the de&s;cent of the Holy Gho&s;t at the day of Penteco&s;t. They were then <HI>clean</HI> as Chri&s;t him&s;elf had borne them witne&s;s, <HI>by the word which he had &s;poken unto them.</HI> They then <HI>had faith,</HI> otherwi&s;e he could not have prayed for them, that their <HI>faith</HI> might
<PB N="155" REF="029861_0153_0FE2AA4599864D40"><HI>not fail.</HI> Yet they had not in the full &s;en&s;e <HI>new hearts;</HI> neither had they received <HI>the gift of the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The fourth &s;ermon which he preached, concerning the ground of faith, made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon me, that when I went home, I could not but write down the &s;ub&s;tance of it, which was as follows:</P>
<P>"The word of reconciliation which the apo&s;tles preached, as the foundation of all they taught was, that <HI>we are reconciled to God, not by our own works, nor by our own righteou&s;ne&s;s, but wholly and &s;olely by the blood of Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>"But you will &s;ay, mu&s;t I not grieve and mourn for my &s;ins? Mu&s;t I not humble my&s;elf before God? Is not this ju&s;t and right? And mu&s;t I not do this before I can expect God to be reconciled to me? I an&s;wer, it is ju&s;t and right. You mu&s;t be humbled before God. You mu&s;t have a broken and contrite heart. But then, ob&s;erve, this is not your own work. Do you grieve that you are a &s;inner? This is the work of the Holy Gho&s;t. Are you contrite? Are you humbled before God? Do you indeed mourn, and is your heart broken within you? All this work|eth the &s;elf-&s;ame &s;pirit.</P>
<P>"Ob&s;erve again, this is not the foundation. It is not this by which you are ju&s;tified. This is not the righteou&s;ne&s;s, this is no part of the righteou&s;ne&s;s by which you are reconciled unto God. You grieve for your &s;ins. You are deeply humble. Your heart is broken. Well&punc; but all this is nothing to your ju&s;tifi|cation. The remi&s;&s;ion of your &s;ins is not owing to this cau&s;e, either in whole or in part. Your humilia|tion and contrition have no influence on that. Nay, ob&s;erve farther, that it may hinder your ju&s;tification, that is, if you build any thing upon it; if you think, I mu&s;t be <HI>&s;o or &s;o</HI> contrite. I mu&s;t grieve <HI>more,</HI> be|fore I can be ju&s;tified. Under&s;tand this well. To think you mu&s;t be <HI>more</HI> contrite, <HI>more</HI> humble, <HI>more</HI> grieved, <HI>more</HI> &s;en&s;ible of the weight of &s;in, before
<PB N="156" REF="029861_0154_0FE2AA4E37CA5170">you can be ju&s;tified; is, to lay your contrition, your grief, your humiliation for the foundation of your being ju&s;tified; at lea&s;t for a part of the foundation. Therefore it hinders your ju&s;tification; and a hinder|ance it is which mu&s;t be removed, before you can lay the right foundation. The right foundation is, not <HI>your</HI> contrition (though that is not your <HI>own)</HI> not <HI>your</HI> righteou&s;ne&s;s, nothing of <HI>your own:</HI> nothing that is wrought <HI>in you</HI> by the Holy Gho&s;t: but it is &s;omething <HI>without you,</HI> viz. The righteou&s;ne&s;s and the blood of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>"For this is the word, <HI>To him that believeth on God that ju&s;tifieth the ungodly, his faith is founted for righteou&s;|ne&s;s.</HI> See ye not, that the foundation is nothing in us? There is no connexion between God and the un|godly. There is no tie to unite them. They are altogether &s;eparate from each other. They have no|thing in common. There is nothing le&s;s or more in the ungodly, to join them to God. Works, righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, contrition? No, Ungodline&s;s only. This then do, if you will lay a right foundation. Go &s;traight to Chri&s;t with all your ungodline&s;s. Tell him, thou who&s;e eyes are as a flame of fire &s;earching my heart, &s;ee&s;t that I am ungodly. I plead nothing el&s;e. I do not &s;ay, I am humble or contrite; but I am ungodly. Therefore bring me to him that ju&s;tifi|eth the ungodly. Let thy blood be the propitia|tion for me. For there is nothing in me but ungod|line&s;s.</P>
<P>"Here is a my&s;tery. Here the wi&s;e men of the world are lo&s;t, are taken in their own craftine&s;s. This the learned of the world cannot comprehend. It is fooli&s;hne&s;s unto them: &s;in is the only thing which divides men from God. Sin (let him that heareth under&s;tand) is the only thing which unites them to God, <HI>i. e.</HI> the only thing which moves the Lamb of

<P>"This is the <HI>word of reconciliation</HI> which we preach. This is the foundation which never can be moved. By faith we are built upon this foundation; and this faith al&s;o is the gift of God. It is his free gift, which he now and ever giveth to every one that is willing to receive it. And when they have received this gift of God, then their hearts will melt for &s;or|row that they have offended him. But this gift of God lives in the heart, not in the head. The faith of the head, learned from men or books, is nothing worth. It brings neither remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, nor peace with God. Labour then to believe with your whole heart. So &s;hall you have redemption through the blood of Chri&s;t. So &s;hall you be clean&s;ed from all &s;in.

<P>Satur. 12. Was the interce&s;&s;ion day, when many &s;trangers were pre&s;ent, &s;ome of whom came twenty or thirty miles. I would gladly have &s;pent my life here: but my Ma&s;ter calling me to labour in another part of his vineyard, on Monday 14, I was con&s;train|ed to take my leave of this happy place; Martin Dober, and a few others of the brethren, walking with us about an hour. O when &s;hall THIS chri&s;ti|anity cover the earth, as the <HI>waters cover the &s;ea!</HI></P>
<P>To hear in what manner God <HI>out of darkne&s;s com|manded this light to &s;hine,</HI> mu&s;t be agreeable to all tho&s;e in every nation, who can te&s;tify from their own ex|perience, <HI>The gracious Lord hath &s;o done his marvel|lous acts, that they ought to be had in remembrance.</HI> I &s;hall therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;ubjoin the &s;ub&s;tance of &s;everal conver&s;ations, which I had at Hernhuth, chiefly on this &s;ubject.

<P>It was on Augu&s;t 10 (old &s;tile) that I had an op|portunity of &s;pending &s;ome hours with Chri&s;tian Da|vid. He is a carpenter by trade, more than middle aged, though I believe not fifty yet. Mo&s;t of his words I under&s;tood well; if at any time I did not, one of the brethren who went with me, explained them in Latin. The &s;ub&s;tance of what he &s;poke, I immediately after wrote down; which was as follows:</P>
<P>"When I was young, I was much troubled at hearing &s;ome affirm that the Pope was Antichri&s;t. I read the Lutheran books writ again&s;t the Papi&s;ts, and the Popi&s;h books writ again&s;t the Lutherans. I ea&s;i|ly &s;aw that the Papi&s;ts were in the wrong; but not that the Lutherans were in the right. I could not under&s;tand what they meant by being ju&s;tified by faith, by faith alone, by faith without works. Neither did I like their talking &s;o much of Chri&s;t. Then I be|gan to think, How can Chri&s;t be the Son of God? But the more I rea&s;oned with my&s;elf upon it, the more confu&s;ed I was, till at la&s;t I loathed the very name of Chri&s;t. I could not bear to mention it. I hated the &s;ound of it; and would never willingly have either read or heard it. In this temper I left Moravia, and wandered through many countries, &s;eek|ing re&s;t but finding none.</P>
<P>In the&s;e wandering; I fell among &s;ome Jews. Their objections again&s;t the new te&s;tament, threw me into fre&s;h doubts. At la&s;t I &s;et my&s;elf to read over the old te&s;tament, and &s;ee if the prophecies therein con|tained were fulfilled. I was &s;oon convinced they were. And thus much I gained, a fixed belief that Je&s;us was the Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>But &s;oon after this, a new doubt aro&s;e, Are the new te&s;tament prophecies fulfilled! This I next &s;et my&s;elf to examine. I read them carefully over, and
<PB N="159" REF="029861_0157_0FE2AA53485C2EB8">could not but &s;ee every event an&s;wered the prediction: &s;o that the more I compared the one with the other, the more fully I was convinced that <HI>All &s;cripture was given by in&s;piration of God.</HI></P>
<P>Yet &s;till my &s;oul was not in peace: nor indeed did I expect it, till I &s;hould have openly renounced the errors of Popery: which accordingly I did at Berlin. I now al&s;o led a very &s;trict life. I read much, and prayed much. I did all I could to conquer &s;in; yet it profited not; I was &s;till conquered by it. Neither found I any more re&s;t among the Lutherans, than I did before among the Papi&s;ts.</P>
<P>At length, not knowing what to do, I li&s;ted my|&s;elf a &s;oldier. Now I thought I &s;hould have more time to pray and read, having with me a new te&s;ta|ment and a hymn-book. But in one day both my books were &s;tole. This almo&s;t broke my heart. Find|ing al&s;o in this way of life all the inconveniencies which I thought to avoid by it, after &s;ix months I returned to my trade, and followed it two years. Removing then to Gorlitz in Saxony, I fell into a dangerous illne&s;s. I could not &s;tir hand nor foot for twenty weeks. Pa&s;tor Sleder came to me every day. And from him it was, that the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t came fir&s;t with power to my &s;oul.</P>
<P>Here I found the peace I had long &s;ought in vain; for I was a&s;&s;ured <HI>my</HI> &s;ins were forgiven. Not indeed all at once, but by degrees; not in one moment, nor in one hour. For I could not immediately believe, that I <HI>was</HI> forgiven, becau&s;e of the mi&s;take I was then in concerning forgivene&s;s. I &s;aw not then, that the fir&s;t promi&s;e to the children of God is, <HI>Sin &s;hall no more reign over you;</HI> but thought, I was to <HI>feel it in me</HI> no more, from the time it was forgiven. There|fore, although I had the ma&s;tery over it, yet I often feared it was not forgiven, becau&s;e it &s;till <HI>&s;tirred in me,</HI> and at &s;ome times <HI>thru&s;t &s;ore at me, that I might fall:</HI>
<PB N="160" REF="029861_0158_0FE2AA5BF73B9660">becau&s;e though it did not <HI>reign,</HI> it did <HI>remain</HI> in me; and I was continually <HI>tempted,</HI> though not <HI>overcome,</HI> This at that time threw me into many doubts: not un|der&s;tanding that the devil <HI>tempts,</HI> properly &s;peaking, only tho&s;e whom he perceives to be e&s;caping from him. He need not tempt his own: for they <HI>lie in the wick|ed one</HI> (as St. John ob&s;erves) and do his will with greedine&s;s. But tho&s;e whom Chri&s;t is &s;etting free, he tempts day and night, to &s;ee if he can recover them to his kingdom. Neither &s;aw I then, that the <HI>being ju&s;tified,</HI> is widely different from the having <HI>the full a&s;&s;urance of faith.</HI> I remembered not, that our Lord told his <HI>apo&s;tles</HI> before his death, <HI>Ye are clean;</HI> where|as it was not till many days after it, that they were fully a&s;&s;ured by the Holy Gho&s;t then received, of their reconciliation to God, through his blood. The dif|ference between the&s;e fruits of the Spirit was as yet hid from me; &s;o that I was hardly and &s;lowly con|vinced I had the one, becau&s;e I had not the other.</P>
<P>When I was recovered from my illne&s;s, I re&s;olved to return into Moravia, and preach Chri&s;t to my rela|tions there Thence I came back to Gorlitz, when I continued five years, and there was a great awak|ening both in the town and country round about. In this &s;pace I made two more journies into Moravia, where more and more came to hear me, many of whom promi&s;ed to come to me, wherever I was, when a door &s;hould be opened for them.</P>
<P>After my return from my third journey, Count Zinzendorf &s;ent to Gorlitz, the mini&s;ter of Berthold&s;|dorf being dead, for Mr. Rothe who was in a gentle|man's family there, to be mini&s;ter of that place. Mr. Rothe told him of me, and he writ to me to come to him, and when I came, &s;aid, <Q>Let as many as will of your friends come hither; I will give them land to build on, and Chri&s;t will give them the re&s;t.</Q> I went immediately into Moravia and told them, God
<PB N="161" REF="029861_0159_0FE2AA5DA1485708">had now found out a place for us. Ten of them fol|lowed me then; ten more the next year; one more in my following journey. The Papi&s;ts were now alarm|ed, &s;et a price upon my head, and levelled the hou&s;e I had lodged in, even with the ground. I made howe|ver eleven journies thither in all, and conducted as ma|ny as de&s;ired it to this place, the way to which was now &s;o well known that many came of them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Eighteen years ago we built the fir&s;t hou&s;e. We cho&s;e to be near the great road rather than at Bert|hold&s;dorf (for the Count gave us our choice) hoping we might thereby find opportunities of in&s;tructing &s;ome that travelled by us. In two years we were in|crea&s;ed to a hundred and fifty; when I contracted an intimate acquaintance with a Calvini&s;t, who after &s;ome time brought me over to his opinion touching election and reprobation: and by me were mo&s;t of our brethren likewi&s;e brought over to the &s;ame opinions. About this time we were in great &s;traits, wherewith many were much dejected. I endeavoured to comfort them with the &s;en&s;e of God's love towards them. But they an&s;wered, <Q>Nay, it may be he hath no love to|wards us; it may be we are not of the election: but God hated us from eternity, and therefore he has &s;uffered all the&s;e things to come upon us.</Q> The Count ob&s;erving this, de&s;ired me to go to a neigh|bouring mini&s;ter, pa&s;tor Steinm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tz, and talk with him, fully on that head, "Whether Chri&s;t died for all?" I did &s;o, and by him God fully convinced me of that important truth. And not long after, the Count de|fired we might all meet together, and con&s;ider the&s;e things throughly. We met accordingly at his hou&s;e, and parted not for three days. We opened the &s;crip|tures, and con&s;idered the account which is given there|in, of the whole oeconomy of God with man, from the creation to the con&s;ummation of all things, and by the ble&s;&s;ing of God we came all to one mind; par|ticularly
<PB N="162" REF="029861_0160_0FE2AA5F31948CF8">in that fundamental point, that <HI>He willeth all men to be &s;aved, and to come to the knowledge of his truth.</HI></P>
<P>Sometime after, the Je&s;uits told the Emperor, that the Count was gathering together all the Moravians and Bohemians, forming them into one body, and making a new religion. Commi&s;&s;ioners were immedi|ately &s;ent to Hernhuth, to examine the truth of this. The &s;ub&s;tance of the final an&s;wer returned through them to the Emperor was as follows.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD><HI>An extract of the public in&s;trument &s;igned at Hernhuth, in Augu&s;t,</HI> 1729.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. WE believe the church of the Bohemian and Moravian brethren, from whom we are de&s;cended, to have been a holy and undefiled church, as is owned by Luther and all other Prote|&s;tant divines: who own al&s;o that our doctrine agrees with theirs. But our di&s;cipline they have not.</P>
<P N="2">2. But we do not re&s;t upon the holine&s;s of our an|ce&s;tors; it being our continual care to &s;hew that we are pa&s;t from death unto life, by wor&s;hipping God in Spirit and in truth. Nor do we account any man a brother, unle&s;s he has either pre&s;erved inviolate the covenant he made with God in Lapti&s;m, or, if he has broken it, been born again of God.</P>
<P N="3">3. On the other &s;ide, who&s;oever they are who be|ing &s;prinkled by the blood of Chri&s;t, are &s;anctified through faith, we receive them as brethren, although in &s;ome points they may differ from us. Not that we can renounce or give up any doctrine of God, contain|ed in holy writ; the lea&s;t part of which is dearer unto us, than thou&s;ands of gold and &s;ilver.</P>
<P N="4">4. Di&s;cipline we judge to be nece&s;&s;ary in the high|e&s;t degree, for all tho&s;e who have any knowledge of divine truth: and we can therefore in no wi&s;e for&s;ake
<PB N="163" REF="029861_0161_0FE2AA60C621B3C0">that, which we have received from our forefathers. Yet if it &s;hould ever be (which God forbid) that any of us &s;hould &s;peak or act perver&s;e things, we could only &s;ay, with St. John, <HI>They went forth from us, but were not of us: for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. The public wor&s;hip of God at Berthold&s;dorf, which we have hitherto frequented, we are the le&s;s a|ble now to for&s;ake, becau&s;e we have there an a&s;&s;embly of true believers, a doctrine free from error, and a pa&s;tor who <HI>having laboured much in the word, is worthy of double honour.</HI> Therefore we have no cau&s;e to form any congregation, &s;eparate from this; e&s;pecially &s;eeing we both u&s;e that liberty which Chri&s;t hath purcha&s;ed for us; and &s;o often experience the power of the doc|trine which is taught there, and agree with the evan|gelical prote&s;tants (i. e. Lutherans) in all truths of importance. As for the controverted points, which require a &s;ubtle wit, we either are ignorant of them, or de&s;pi&s;e them.</P>
<P N="6">6. The name of brethren and &s;i&s;ters we do not reject, as being agreeable both to &s;cripture and to Chri&s;tian &s;implicity. But we do not approve of be|ing called by the name of any man: as knowing, <HI>we have one father, even him which is in heaven.</HI></P>
</LETTER>
<P>In 1732 we were again required to give an account of our&s;elves. This was then done, in the manner following.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD><HI>An extract of a letter wrote by the church of Hernhuth, to the pre&s;ident of Upper Lu&s;atia,</HI> 24 <HI>Jan.</HI> 1732.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. NONE can be ignorant of the religion of our ance&s;tors, who have read the hi&s;tory of John Hu&s;s. Some of his followers endeavoured to repel force by force. The re&s;t, having better learn|ed
<PB N="164" REF="029861_0162_0FE2AA67F7A06EC8">Chri&s;t, obtained leave of George Podibrad, king of Bohemia, to retire and live apart. Retiring ac|cordingly in the year 1453, to a place on the borders of Sile&s;m and Moravia, they lived in peace, till the time of Luther and Calvin, with both of whom, as with their followers, they maintained a friendly inter|cour&s;e, e&s;pecially when by the providence of God, they were placed among tho&s;e of either opinion.</P>
<P N="2">2. In the year 1699, David Earne&s;t Jablon&s;ky, grand&s;on to Amos Comenius, the la&s;t bi&s;hop of the Moravians, was con&s;ecrated bi&s;hop of the united bre|thren in Moravia, Bohemia and Poland, in a &s;ynod regularly a&s;&s;embled. To him Count Zinzendorf &s;ig|nified, that &s;everal of the Moravian brethren, having e&s;caped from the tyranny of the Papi&s;ts, were &s;o join|ed to the Lutherans, who&s;e doctrine they approved, as neverthele&s;s to retain their ancient di&s;cipline. His entire approbation of this, bi&s;hop Jablon&s;ky te&s;tified to the Count in &s;everal letters</P>
<P N="3">3. It mu&s;t be acknowledged, that many of our an|ce&s;tors, about the beginning of the reformation, from fear of man, did not openly confe&s;s the truth. And hence it was that the Romi&s;h pa&s;tors bore with them; being little concerned what their private opini|ons were. But hence it al&s;o was, that continually u&s;ing di&s;&s;imulation, and not walking in &s;implicity, they were no longer fervent in &s;pirit, as of old time, neither could they find any peace to their &s;ouls.</P>
<P N="4">4. It was in the year 1715, that a &s;oldier of the Emperor's, lately di&s;charged came to Sehl, a village of which the Je&s;uits are Lords, and began to talk with Augu&s;tine Neu&s;&s;er and his brother. He &s;harply reproved their hypocri&s;y, in pretending to be Roman|i&s;ts, and di&s;&s;embling the true faith. Yet they <HI>confer|red with fle&s;h and blood,</HI> till the year 1722, when at length they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ook all, and retired into Upper Lu&s;a|tia. They left three brothers behind them, who were &s;oon after ca&s;t into pri&s;on, and grievou&s;ly per&s;ecuted
<PB N="165" REF="029861_0163_0FE2AA6AF9B8BBC0">by the Papi&s;ts: &s;o that as &s;oon as ever a door was o|pened, they al&s;o left all, and followed their brothers into Lu&s;atia. The &s;ame did many others &s;oon after, as finding no &s;afety, either for body or &s;oul in their own country: whence about the &s;ame time, Michael and Martin Linner, and the Haberlands were driven out, with their families, after having &s;uffered the lo&s;s of all things, for not conforming to the Romi&s;h wor|&s;hip, and for receiving tho&s;e they called Heretics into to their hou&s;es.</P>
<P N="5">5. But the brethren at Kuhnewald were treated with &s;till greater &s;everity. All their books were tak|en away; they were compelled by the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite torments, to conform to the Popi&s;h &s;uper&s;titions and idolatries; and in the end ca&s;t into, and kept in, the mo&s;t loath&s;ome pri&s;ons: whereby David Schneider, the Nit&s;chmans, and many others, were con&s;trained al&s;o to leave their country, and all that they had. The&s;e are the plain rea&s;ons of our leaving Moravia, of which your excellency de&s;ired an account from us."</P>
</LETTER>
<P>"In the mean time we found a great remi&s;&s;ne&s;s of behaviour had crept in among us. And indeed the &s;ame was to be found in mo&s;t of tho&s;e round about us, whether Lutherans or Calvini&s;ts, &s;o in&s;i&s;ting on faith, as to forget at lea&s;t in practice, both holine&s;s and good works.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erving this terrible abu&s;e of preaching Chri&s;t <HI>given for us,</HI> we began to in&s;i&s;t more than ever, on Chri&s;t <HI>living in us.</HI> All our exhortation and preach|ing turned on this; we &s;poke, we writ, of nothing el&s;e. Our con&s;tant inquiries were, "Is Chri&s;t formed <HI>in you?</HI> Have you a new heart? Is your &s;oul renewed in the image of God? Is the whole body of &s;in de|&s;troyed in you? Are you fully a&s;&s;ured, beyond all doubt or fear, that you are a child of God? In what manner, and at what moment did you receive that full a&s;&s;urance?" If a man could not an&s;wer all the&s;e que&s;|tions,
<PB N="166" REF="029861_0164_0FE2AA6C8D057730">we judged he had no true faith. Nor would we permit any to receive the Lord's &s;upper among us, till he could.</P>
<P>In this per&s;ua&s;ion we were, when I went to Groen|land, five years ago. There I had a corre&s;pondence by letter with a Dani&s;h mini&s;ter, on the head of ju&s;tification. And it plea&s;ed God to &s;hew me by him (though he was by no means a holy man, but openly guilty of gro&s;s &s;ins) that we had now leaned too much to this hand, and were run into another extreme: that Chri&s;t <HI>in us</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;t for us,</HI> ought indeed to be both in&s;i&s;ted on; but fir&s;t and principally <HI>Chri&s;t for us,</HI> as being the ground of all. I now clearly &s;aw, we ought not to in&s;i&s;t on any thing we <HI>feel,</HI> any more than any thing we do, as if it were nece&s;&s;ary previ|ous to ju&s;tification, or the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins. I &s;aw, that lea&s;t of all ought we &s;o to in&s;i&s;t on the full a&s;|&s;urance of faith, or the de&s;truction of the body of &s;in, and the extinction of all its motions, as to ex|clude tho&s;e who had not attained this from the Lord's table, or to deny that they had any faith at all. I plainly perceived, this full a&s;&s;urance was a di&s;tinct gift from ju&s;tifying faith, and often not given till long after it: and that ju&s;tification does not imply, that fin &s;hould not <HI>&s;tir</HI> in us, but only that it &s;hould not <HI>conquer.</HI></P>
<P>And now fir&s;t it was, that I had that full a&s;&s;urance of my own reconciliation to God, through Chri&s;t. For many years I had had the forgivene&s;s of my &s;ins, and a mea&s;ure of the peace of God; but I had not till now, that witne&s;s of his Spirit, which &s;huts out all doubt and fear. In all my trials I had always a confidence in Chri&s;t, who had done &s;o great things for me. But it was a confidence mixed with fear: I was afraid, <HI>I had not done enough.</HI> There was al|ways &s;omething dark in my &s;oul till now. But now the clear light &s;hined: and I &s;aw that what I had hitherto &s;o con&s;tantly in&s;i&s;ted on, the <HI>doing</HI> &s;o much and <HI>feeling</HI> &s;o
<PB N="167" REF="029861_0165_0FE2AA6EF0FDD308">much, the long repentance and preparation for be|lieving, the bitter &s;orrow for &s;in, and that deep con|trition of heart which is found in &s;ome, where by no means e&s;&s;ential to ju&s;tification.

<P>After my return to Hernhuth, I found it difficult at fir&s;t, to make my brethren &s;en&s;ible of this, or to per&s;uade them not to in&s;i&s;t on the a&s;&s;urance of faith, as a nece&s;&s;ary qualification for receiving the Lord's &s;upper.

<P>The &s;ame day I was with Michael Linner, the elde&s;t of the church; the &s;um of who&s;e conver&s;ation was this:</P>
<P>"The church of Moravia was once a glorious church. But it is now covered with thick darkne&s;s. It is about &s;ixteen years ago, that I began to &s;eek for light. I had a New Te&s;tament which I con&s;tant|ly read; upon which I often &s;aid to my&s;elf, "This &s;ays, I ought to be humble, and meek, and pure in heart. How comes it that I am not &s;o?" I went to the be&s;t men I knew, and a&s;ked, "Is not this the word of God? And if &s;o, ought I not to be &s;uch as this requires, both in heart and life?" They an&s;wered,
<PB N="168" REF="029861_0166_0FE2AAC223DE4428">"The fir&s;t Chri&s;tians were &s;uch; but it was impo&s;&s;i|ble for <HI>us</HI> to be &s;o perfect." This an&s;wer gave me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;atisfaction. I knew God could not mock his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eatures, by requiring of them what he &s;aw it was impo&s;&s;ible for them to perform. I a&s;ked others, but had &s;till the &s;ame an&s;wer, which troubled me more and more.</P>
<P>About fourteen years ago, I was more than ever convinced, that I was wholly different from what God required me to be. I con&s;ulted his word again and again; but it &s;poke nothing but condemnation; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ill at la&s;t I could not read, nor indeed do any thing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, having no hope and no &s;pirit le&s;t in me. I had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">een in this &s;tate for &s;everal days, when being mu&s;ing by my&s;elf, the&s;e words came &s;trongly into my mind, <HI>"God &s;o loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, to the end that all who believe in him, &s;hould not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eri&s;h but have everla&s;ting life."</HI> I thought, "<HI>All?</HI> Then I am one. Then he is given for <HI>me.</HI> But I am a &s;inner. And he came to &s;ave &s;inners." Im|mediately my burden dropped off, and my heart was at re&s;t.</P>
<P>But the full a&s;&s;urance of faith I had not yet; nor for the two years I continued in Moratia. When I was driven out thence by the Je&s;uits, I retired hither, and was &s;oon after received into the church. And here after &s;ome time it plea&s;ed our Lord to manife&s;t him&s;elf more clearly to my &s;oul, and give me that full &s;en&s;e of acceptance in him, which excludes all doubt and fear.</P>
<P>Indeed the leading of the &s;pirit is different in dif|ferent &s;ouls. His more u&s;ual method, I believe is, to give in one and the &s;ame moment the forgivne&s;s of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and a full a&s;&s;urance of that forgivene&s;s. Yet in many he works as he did in me: giving fir&s;t the re|mi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, and after &s;ome weeks or months <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the full a&s;&s;urance of it."</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="029861_0167_0FE2AA789441F578">
This great truth was farther confirmed to me the next day by the conver&s;ation I had with David Nit&s;ch|man, one of the teachers or pa&s;tors of the church<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> who expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to this effect:</P>
<P>"In my childhood I was very &s;erious; but as I grew up, was &s;o carele&s;s, that at eighteen years old, I had even forgot to read. When I found this, I was &s;tartled. I &s;oon learned again, and then &s;pent much time in reading and prayer. But I knew no|thing of my heart, till about the age of twenty-&s;ix, I bought a bible, and began to read the New Te&s;ta|ment. The farther I read, the more I was condemn|ed. I found a law which I did not, could not keep. I had a will to avoid all &s;in: but the power I had not. I continually &s;trove; but was continually con|quered. The thing which <HI>I would I did not;</HI> but what I <HI>would</HI> not have done, that I did. In this bondage I was, when I fell into a &s;it of &s;ickne&s;s; during my recovery from which I felt a &s;tronger de|&s;ire than ever, to avoid all &s;in. At the &s;ame time I felt the power. And &s;in no longer reigned over me.</P>
<P>But &s;oon after I fell into grievous temptations; which made me very unea&s;y. For though I yielded not to them, yet they returned again, and again, as fa&s;t as they were conquered. Then it came into my mind, "I take all this pains to &s;erve God. What if there be no God? How do I know there is?" And on this I mu&s;ed more and more, till I &s;aid in my heart, "There is no God!"</P>
<P>In this &s;tate I was when I came to Hernhuth, about fourteen years ago. And every day for a full year, from morning to night, I groaned under this un|belief. Yet I prayed continually, unbelieving as I was; particularly one Sunday, when being in the church of Berthold&s;dorf, and quite weary of hearing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> much of him, who&s;e very being I did not believe,
<PB N="170" REF="029861_0168_0FE2AA7A232D8610">I vehemently &s;aid, "O God, If thou be a God, thou mu&s;t manife&s;t thy&s;elf, or I cannot believe it." In walking home, I thought of an expre&s;&s;ion of Pa&s;tor Rothe's, "Only <HI>&s;uppo&s;e</HI> the&s;e things are &s;o: <HI>&s;uppo&s;e</HI> there be a God." I &s;aid to my&s;elf, "Well, I with I <HI>do</HI> &s;uppo&s;e it." Immediately I felt a &s;trange &s;weet|ne&s;s in my &s;oul, which increa&s;ed every moment till the next morning: and from that time, if all the men upon earth, and all the devils in hell had joined in denying it, I could not have doubted the being of God, no, not for one moment. This fir&s;t &s;weetne&s;s la&s;ted for &s;ix weeks, without any intermi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I then fell into doubts of another kind. I believed in God; but not in Chri&s;t. I opened my heart to Martin Dober, who u&s;ed many arguments with me, but in vain. For above four years I found no re&s;t, by rea&s;on of this unbelief, till one day, as I was &s;itting in my hou&s;e de&s;pairing of any relief, tho&s;e words &s;hot into me, <HI>"God was in Chri&s;t, reconciling the world to him&s;elf."</HI> I thought, "Then God and Chri&s;t are one." Immediately my heart was filled with joy; and much more at the remembrance of the&s;e words which I now felt I <HI>did believe. "The word was with God, and the word was God. And the word was made fle&s;h, and dwelt among us."</HI></P>
<P>Yet in a few days I was troubled again. I believed Chri&s;t was the Saviour of the world. But I could not call him <HI>my</HI> Saviour, neither did I believe, he would &s;ave <HI>me.</HI> And one day, as I was walking acro&s;s the &s;quare, that text came &s;trongly into my mind, <HI>"The unbelieving &s;hall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brim&s;tone."</HI> I return|ed home, terrified beyond expre&s;&s;ion, and in&s;tantly began crying out to our Saviour, telling him, "I de&s;erved no le&s;s than hell, and gave my&s;elf up, if it were his will, to &s;uffer what I had de&s;erved." In a
<PB N="171" REF="029861_0169_0FE2AA7BF5F4AAF8">moment I found a gleam of hope, that he <HI>would</HI> have mercy even on me.</P>
<P>But this in a &s;hort time vani&s;hed away, and my un|ea&s;ine&s;s returned again. Many endeavoured to per|&s;uade me that I had, but I knew I had not, a right faith in Chri&s;t. For I had no confidence in him; nor could I lay hold upon him as <HI>my</HI> Saviour. Indeed reading one day (in Arndt's True Chri&s;tianity) "That if all the &s;ins of all the men upon earth were joined in one man, the blood of Chri&s;t was &s;ufficient to clean&s;e that man from all &s;in:" I felt for a time comfort and peace: but it was but for a time, and then I was over|whelmed as before with &s;adne&s;s and unbelief. And I was oppre&s;&s;ed almo&s;t beyond my &s;trength, when

<P>Some of the circum&s;tances of this uncommon rela|tion, were made more clear to me, by the account I
<PB N="172" REF="029861_0170_0FE2AA8447173368">received in the afternoon from a &s;tudent at Hernl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uth, Albinus Theodorus Feder.</P>
<P>"I (&s;aid he) for three years &s;ought again&s;t &s;in with all my might, by fa&s;ting and prayer and all the other means of grace. But notwith&s;tanding all my endea|vours, I gained no ground; &s;in &s;till prevailed over me; till at la&s;t, not knowing what to do farther, I was on the very brink of de&s;pair. Then it was that having no other refuge left, I fled to my Saviour as one lo&s;t and undone, and that had no hope but in his power and free mercy. In that moment I found my heart at re&s;t, in good hope that my &s;ins were forgiven; of which, I had a &s;tronger a&s;&s;urance &s;ix weeks after, when I received the Lord's &s;upper here. But I dare not affirm, I am a child of God; neither have I the &s;eal of the Spirit. Yet I go on quietly doing my Sa|viour's will, taking &s;helter in his wounds, from all trouble and &s;in, and knowing he will perfect his work in his own time."</P>
<P>Martin Dober, when I de&s;cribed my &s;tate to him, &s;aid, "He had known very many believers, who if a&s;ked the que&s;tion, would not have dared to affirm, that they were the children of God. And he added, It is very common for per&s;ons to receive remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, or ju&s;tification through faith in the blood of Chri&s;t, before they receive the full a&s;&s;urance of faith, which God many times with-holds, till be has tried whether they will work together with him, in the u&s;e of the fir&s;t gift. Nor is there any need (continued he, Dober) to incite any one to &s;eek that a&s;&s;urance by telling him, the faith he has is nothing. This will be more likely to drive him to de&s;pair, than to encou|rage him to pre&s;s forward. His &s;ingle bu&s;ine&s;s, who has received the fir&s;t gift is, <HI>credendo credere &amp; in cre|dendo per&s;everare</HI> (to believe on, and to hold fa&s;t that whereunto he hath obtained). To go on, doing his
<PB N="173" REF="029861_0171_0FE2AA8634EB2A38">Lord's will, according to the ability God hath alrea|dy given; chearfully and faithfully to u&s;e what he has received, without &s;olicitude for the re&s;t."</P>
<P>In the conver&s;ation I afterwards had with Augu&s;|tine Neu&s;&s;er, a knife-&s;mith (another of the pa&s;tors or teachers of the church, about &s;ixty years of age) as al&s;o with his brothers, Wen&s;el, and Hantz Neu&s;&s;er, the nature of true faith and &s;alvation was yet far|ther explained to me.</P>
<P>Augu&s;tine Neu&s;&s;er &s;poke to this effect:</P>
<P>"By experience I know, that we cannot be ju&s;tifi|ed through the blood of Chri&s;t, till we feel that all our righteou&s;ne&s;s and good works avail nothing to|wards our ju&s;tification. Therefore what men call <HI>a good life,</HI> is frequently the greate&s;t of all hinderances to their coming to Chri&s;t. For it will not let them &s;ee, that they are lo&s;t, undone &s;inners, and if they &s;ee not this, they cannot come unto him.</P>
<P>Thus it was with me. I had led a good life from a child. And this was the great hinderance to my coming to Chri&s;t. For, abounding in good works, and diligently u&s;ing all the means of grace, I per&s;uad|ed my&s;elf for thirteen or fourteen years, that all was well, and I could not fail of &s;alvation. And yet, I cannot &s;ay my &s;oul was at re&s;t, even till the time when God &s;hewed me clearly, that my heart was as corrupt, notwith&s;tanding all my good works, as that of an adulterer or murderer. Then my &s;elf-depend|ence withered away. I wanted a Saviour, and fled naked to him. And in him I found true re&s;t to my &s;oul, being fully a&s;&s;ured that all <HI>my</HI> &s;ins were forgiv|en. Yet I cannot tell the hour or day, when I fir&s;t received that full a&s;&s;urance. For it was not given me at fir&s;t, neither at once; but grew up in me by de|grees.
<PB N="174" REF="029861_0172_0FE2AA87CB9F1130">But from the time it was confirmed in me, I never lo&s;t it; having never &s;ince doubted, no, not for a moment."</P>
<P>What Wen&s;el Neu&s;&s;er &s;aid was as follows:</P>
<P>"From a child I had many fits of &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, and was often unea&s;y at my &s;ins: this unea&s;ine&s;s was much increa&s;ed fifteen years &s;ince, by the preaching of Chri&s;tian David. I thought the way to get ea&s;e was, to go and live among the Lutherans, whom I &s;uppo&s;ed to be all good Chri&s;tians. But I &s;oon found they, as well as the Papi&s;ts, were carnal, world|ly-minded men. About thirteen years ago I came from among them to Hernhuth; but was &s;till as un|ea&s;y as before: which I do not wonder at now (though I did then) for all this time, though I &s;aw clearly, I could not be &s;aved, but by the death of Chri&s;t, yet I did not tru&s;t in that <HI>only</HI> for &s;alvation, but depend|ed on my own righteou&s;ne&s;s <HI>al&s;o,</HI> as the joint conditi|on of my acceptance.</P>
<P>After I was &s;ettled here, &s;eeing the great diver&s;ity of &s;ects wherewith we were &s;urrounded, I began to doubt whether any religion was true? For half a year the&s;e doubts perplexed me greatly; and I was of|ten ju&s;t on the point of ca&s;ting off all religion, and returning to the world. The fear of doing this threw me into a deeper concern than ever I had been in be|fore. Nor could I find how to e&s;cape, for the more I &s;truggled the more I was entangled. I often re|flected on my former cour&s;e of life, as more de&s;ira|ble than this. And one day, in the bitterne&s;s of my &s;oul, be&s;ought our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, "at lea&s;t to re&s;tore me to that &s;tate, which I was in before I left Mora|via." In that moment he manife&s;ted him&s;elf to me, &s;o that I could lay hold on him as <HI>my</HI> Saviour, and
<PB N="175" REF="029861_0173_0FE2AA895BBAA200">&s;hewed me, it is <HI>only</HI> the blood of Chri&s;t which clean&s;eth us from all &s;in. This was ten years &s;ince, and from that hour, I have not had one doubt of my acceptance. Yet I have not any tran&s;ports of joy. Nor had I when he thus revealed him&s;elf un|to me. Only I well remember, that manife&s;tation of him&s;elf was like a cool, refre&s;hing wind, to one that is fainting away with fultry heat. And ever &s;ince my &s;oul has been &s;weetly at re&s;t, de&s;iring no other portion in earth or heaven."</P>
<P>"I was awakened (&s;aid Hantz Neu&s;&s;er) by my grandfather when a child, and by him carefully in|&s;tructed in the new te&s;tament. I married young, and being from that time weak and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ckly, was the more earne&s;t to work out my &s;alvation: and nineteen or twenty years ago, I had a &s;trong confidence in our. Saviour, and was continually warning others again&s;t tru&s;ting in them&s;elves, in their own righteou&s;ne&s;s or good works. Yet I was not free from it my&s;elf. I did not tru&s;t in him <HI>only</HI> for acceptance with God. And hence it was, that not building on the right foundation, the blood and righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t alone, I could not gain a full victory over my &s;ins, but &s;ometimes conquered them, and &s;ometimes was conquered by them. And therefore I had not a full or con&s;tant peace, though I was commonly ea|&s;y, and hoping for mercy.</P>
<P>Sixteen years ago (on Saturday next) I came to my brother Augu&s;tine at Hernhuth. There was then only one little hou&s;e here. Here I continued eight years in much the &s;ame &s;tate, thinking I tru&s;ted in Chri&s;t alone; but indeed tru&s;ting partly in his and partly in my own righteou&s;ne&s;s. I was walking one day in this little wood, when God di&s;covered my heart to me. I &s;aw I had till that hour tru&s;ted in my own righteou&s;ne&s;s, and at the &s;ame time, that I had
<PB N="176" REF="029861_0174_0FE2AA945BAE5590">no righteou&s;ne&s;s at all, being altogether corrupt and abominable, and fit only for the fire of hell. At this &s;ight I fell into bitter grief, and an horrible dread o|verwhelmed me, expecting nothing (as I &s;aw I de&s;erv|ed nothing el&s;e) but to be &s;wallowed up in a moment. In that moment I beheld the Lamb of God, taking away my &s;ins. And from that time I have had re|demption through his blood, and full a&s;&s;urance of it. I have that peace in him which never fails, and which admits of no doubt or fear. Indeed I am but a little one in Chri&s;t; therefore I can receive as yet but little of him. But from his fulne&s;s I have enough; and I prai&s;e him, and am &s;atisfied."</P>
<P>In the three or four following days I had an oppor|tunity of talking with Zacharias Neu&s;&s;er (cou&s;in to Hantz) David Schneider, Chri&s;topher Demuth, Ar|vid Gradin (now at Con&s;tantinople) and &s;everal others of the mo&s;t experienced brethren. I believe no pre|face is needful to the account they gave of God's dealings with their &s;ouls, which I doubt not will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ir up many, through his grace, to <HI>glorify their Father which is in heaven.</HI></P>
<P>"I was born (&s;aid Zacharias Neu&s;&s;er) on the bor|ders of Moravia, and was fir&s;t awakened by my cou|&s;in Wen&s;el, who &s;oon after carried me to hear Mr. Steinmetz, a Lutheran mini&s;ter, about thirty Engli&s;h miles off. I was utterly a&s;toni&s;hed. The next week I went again: after which, going to him in private, I opened my heart, and told him all my doubts, tho&s;e e&s;pecially concerning Popery. He offered to receive me into communion with him, which I gladly accept|ed of; and in a &s;hort time after I received the Lord's &s;upper from his ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">. While I was receiving, I felt Chri&s;t had died for <HI>me.</HI> I knew I was reconciled to God. And all the day I was overwhelmed with joy: having tho&s;e words continually on my mind, <HI>This day is &s;alvation come to my hou&s;e: I al&s;o</HI> am a &s;on <HI>of Abra|ham.</HI>
<PB N="177" REF="029861_0175_0FE2AA968CB11D70">This joy I had continually for a year and a half, and my heart was full of love to Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>After this I had thoughts of leaving Moravia. I was convinced it would be better for my &s;oul. Yet I would not do it, becau&s;e I got more money here than I could el&s;ewhere. When I reflected on this, I &s;aid to my&s;elf, "This is mere covetou&s;ne&s;s. But if I am covetous, I am not a child of God." Hence I fell into deep perplexity, nor could I find any way to e|&s;cape out of it. In this &s;lavery and mi&s;ery I was for five years; at the end of which I fell &s;ick: in my &s;ick|ne&s;s my heart was &s;et at liberty, and peace returned to my &s;oul. I now prayed earne&s;tly to God, to re&s;tore my health, that I might leave Moravia. He did re|&s;tore it, and I immediately returned to Hernhuth. After I had been here a quarter of a year, the Count preached one day, upon the nature of &s;anctification. I found I had not experienced what he de&s;cribed, and was greatly terrified. I went to my cou&s;in Wen&s;el, who advi&s;ed me to read over the 3d, 4th and 5th chap|ters of the epi&s;tle to the Romans. I did &s;o. I had read them an hundred times before, yet now they ap|peared quite new, and gave me &s;uch a &s;ight of God's ju&s;tifying the ungodly, as I never had before. On Sunday I went to church at Berthold&s;dorf, and while we were &s;inging tho&s;e words, <HI>"Wir glauben auch in Je&s;um Chri&s;t,"</HI> (we believe al&s;o in Je&s;us Chri&s;t) I clearly &s;aw him as my Saviour. I wanted immediate|ly to be alone, and to pour out my heart before him. My &s;oul was filled with thankfulne&s;s, and with a &s;till, &s;oft, quiet joy, &s;uch as it is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s.

The mo&s;t material part of David Schneider's ac|count was this:</P>
<P>"Both my father and mother feared God, and carefully in&s;tructed me in the holy &s;criptures. I was from a child earne&s;tly de&s;irous to follow their in&s;truc|tions, and more &s;o after my father's death. Yet as I grew up, many &s;ins got the dominion over me. Of which God began to give me a &s;en&s;e, by the preach|ing of Pa&s;tor Steinmetz; who &s;peaking one day of drunkenne&s;s, to which I was then addicted, I was &s;o grieved and a&s;hamed, that for &s;everal days I could not bear to look any one in the face. It plea&s;ed God afterwards to give me, though not all at once, a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n&s;e of my other both outward and inward &s;ins. And before the time of my coming out of Moravia, I knew that my &s;ins were forgiven. Yet I cannot &s;ix on any particular time, when I knew this fir&s;t. For I did not clearly know it at once: God having always done every thing in my &s;oul by degrees.</P>
<P>When I was about twenty-&s;ix I was pre&s;&s;ed in &s;pirit to exhort and in&s;truct my brethren. Accord|ingly many of them met at my hou&s;e to read pray, and &s;ing p&s;alms. They u&s;ually came about ten or eleven, and &s;tayed till one or two in the morning. When Chri&s;tian David came to us, we were much quickened and comforted, and our number greatly in|crea&s;ed. We were undi&s;turbed for two years. But then the Papi&s;ts were informed of our meeting. Im|mediately &s;earch was made. All our books were &s;eized, and we were ordered to appear before the Con&s;i&s;tory. I was examined many times; was im|pri&s;oned, relea&s;ed and impri&s;oned again five times in one year. At la&s;t I was adjudged to pay fifty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ix dollars, and &s;uffer a year's impri&s;onment. But upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> re-hearing, the &s;entence was changed, and I was or|dered to be &s;ent to the gallies. Before this &s;entence
<PB N="179" REF="029861_0177_0FE2AA99B828F400">was executed, I e&s;caped out of pri&s;on, and came to Sorau in Sile&s;ia. Many of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> brethren followed me, and here for near ten years I taught the children in the orphan-hou&s;e. I &s;oon &s;em for my wife and children. But the magi&s;trates had ju&s;t then ordered that the wives and children of all tho&s;e who had fled, &s;hould be taken into &s;afe cu&s;tody. The night before this order was to be executed, &s;he e&s;caped and came to Sorau.</P>
<P>Soon after, &s;ome of my brethren who had been there, pre&s;&s;ed me much to remove to Hernhuth: Chri|&s;tian David in particular, by who&s;e continued impor|tunity, I was at length brought to re&s;olve upon it. But all my brethren at Sorau were &s;till as &s;trongly again&s;t it, as I my&s;elf had formerly been. For a whole year I was &s;truggling to break from them or to per&s;uade them to go too. And it co&s;t me more pains to get from Sorau, than it had done to leave Mo|ravia.</P>
<P>At length I broke loo&s;e and came to Hernhuth, which was about three years ago. Finding I could &s;carce &s;ub&s;i&s;t my family here by hard labour, whereas at Sorau all things were provided for me, I grew ve|ry unea&s;y. The more unea&s;y I was, the more my brethren refrained from my company;
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">.</NOTE> &s;o that in a &s;hort time I was left quite alone. Then I was in deep di&s;tre&s;s indeed. Sin revived and almo&s;t got the ma&s;tery over me. I tried all ways, but found no help. In this mi&s;erable &s;tate I was about a year ago, when the brethren ca&s;t lots concerning me, and were thereby directed to admit me to the Lord's table. And from that hour my &s;oul received comfort, and I was more and more a&s;&s;ured that I had an advocate with the Father, and that I was fully reconciled to God by his blood."</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="029861_0178_0FE2AAA2A33A99B8">
Chri&s;topher Demuth &s;poke to this effect:</P>
<P>"My father was a pious man from his youth. He carefully in&s;tructed all his children. I was about fifteen when he died. A little before he died, hav|ing been all his life-time under the law, he received at once remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, and the full witne&s;s of the Spirit. He called us to him and &s;aid, "My dear children, let your whole tru&s;t be in the blood of Chri&s;t. Seek &s;alvation in this, and in this alone, and he will &s;hew to you the &s;ame mercy he has to me. Yea, and he will &s;hew it to many of your relations and ac|quaintance, when his time is come."</P>
<P>From this time till I was twenty-&s;even years old I was more and more zealous in &s;eeking Chri&s;t. I then removed into Sile&s;ia, and married. A year af|ter I was much pre&s;&s;ed in &s;pirit, to return and vi&s;it my brethren in Moravia. I did &s;o. We had the New Te&s;tament, our Moravian hymns, and two or three Lutheran books. We read and &s;ung, and prayed to|gether, and were much &s;trengthened. One day as we were together at my hou&s;e, one knocked at the door. I opened it and he was a Je&s;uit. He &s;aid, "My dear Demuth, I know you are a good man, and one that in&s;tructs and exhorts your friends, I mu&s;t &s;ee what books you have." And going into the inner room, he found the te&s;tament, and the re&s;t together. He took them all away; nor did we dare to hinder him. The next day we were &s;ummoned before the Con&s;i&s;tory, and after a long examination, ordered to appear in the church before the congregation, on the following Sunday. There they read a long confe&s;&s;i|on of faith, and afterwards bid us &s;ay, "In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t." We did &s;o, though not knowing what they meant. They then told us, "We had abjur|ed the Lutheran errors, and had called the ble&s;&s;ed
<PB N="181" REF="029861_0179_0FE2AAA4B7E02F18">Trinity to witne&s;s, that we a&s;&s;ented to that confe&s;&s;i|on of faith." My heart &s;unk within me when I heard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t. I went home, but could find no re&s;t. I thought I had now denied my Saviour, and could expect no more mercy from him. I could not bear to &s;tay in Moravia any longer, but immediately returned into Si|le&s;ia. There I continued &s;ix years, but there too I was perpetually terrified with the thoughts of what I had done. I often enquired after my brethren whom I had left in Moravia. Some of them I heard were thrown into pri&s;on, and others e&s;caped to a little vil|lage in Lu&s;atia called Hernhuth. I wi&s;hed I could go to that place my&s;elf, and at la&s;t meeting with one who had the &s;ame de&s;ire, we agreed to go together. But our de&s;ign being di&s;covered he was apprehended and thrown into pri&s;on. Expecting the &s;ame treat|ment, I earne&s;tly prayed, "That God would &s;hew me a token for good." Immediately my &s;oul was filled with joy, and I was ready to go to pri&s;on or to death.</P>
<P>Two days pa&s;&s;ed, and no man a&s;ked me any que&s;|tion; when doubting, what I ought to do, I went into a neighbouring wood, and going into a little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ave, fell on my face and prayed, "Lord, thou &s;ee&s;t I am ready to do what thou wilt. If it be thy will I &s;hould be ca&s;t into pri&s;on, thy will be done. If it be thy will, that I &s;hould leave my wife and chil|dren, I am ready. Only &s;hew thy will." Immedi|ately I heard a loud voice &s;aying, <HI>"Fort, fort, fort"</HI> (Go on, go on) I ro&s;e joyful and &s;atisfied; went home and told my wife, "It was God's will I &s;hould now leave her; but that I hoped to return in a &s;hort time, and take her and my children with me." I went out of the door, and in that moment was filled with peace and joy and comfort.</P>
<P>We had above two hundred miles to go (thirty-five German) and neither I, nor my friend who went
<PB N="182" REF="029861_0180_0FE2AAA64B53EED0">with me, had one Kreutzer.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A &s;mall coin of about a half-penny value.</NOTE> But God provided things convenient for us, &s;o that in all the way we wanted nothing.</P>
<P>In this journey God gave me the full a&s;&s;urance that my &s;ins were forgiven. This was twelve years ago, and ever &s;ince, it has been confirmed more and more, by my receiving from him every day fre&s;h &s;upplies of &s;trength and comfort.</P>
<P>By comparing my experience with that of others, you may perceive, how different ways God leads dif|ferent &s;ouls. But though a man &s;hould be led in a way different from that of all other men, yet if his eye be at all times fixed on his Saviour, if his con&s;tant aim be to do his will; if all his de&s;ires tend to him; if in all trials he can draw &s;trength from him; if he fly to him in all troubles, and in all temptations find &s;alva|tion in his blood; in this there can be no delu&s;ion: And who&s;oever is thus minded, however or when|ever it began, is &s;urely reconciled to God through his Son."</P>
<P>Arvid Gradin (a Swede, born in Dalecarlia) &s;poke to this purpo&s;e:</P>
<P>"Before I was ten years old, I had a &s;erious &s;en&s;e of religion, and great fervour in my prayer. This was increa&s;ed by my reading much in the New Te&s;tament; but the more I read, the more earne&s;tly I cried out, "Either the&s;e things are not true, or we are not Chri&s;tians." About &s;ixteen my &s;en&s;e of religion began to decline, by my too great fondne&s;s for learning, e&s;pecially the oriental tongues, wherein I was in&s;tructed by a private preceptor, who like|wi&s;e did all that in him lay, to in&s;truct me in true divinity.</P>
<P>At &s;eventeen I went to the univer&s;ity of Up&s;al, and a year or two after was licen&s;ed to preach. But
<PB N="183" REF="029861_0181_0FE2AAA8C4546218">at twenty-two meeting with Arndt's True Chri&s;tiani|ty, found I my&s;elf was not a Chri&s;tian. Immediately I left off preaching, and betook my&s;elf wholly to philo&s;ophy. This &s;tifled all my convictions for &s;ome years; but when I was about twenty-&s;even, they re|vived, and continued the year after, when I was de|&s;ired to be dome&s;tic tutor to the children of the Se|cretary of State. I now felt I was <HI>carnal, &s;old under &s;in,</HI> and continually &s;truggled to bur&s;t the bonds, till (being about thirty-one years old) I was unawares entangled in much worldly bu&s;ine&s;s. This cooled me in my pur&s;uit of holine&s;s; yet for a year and a half my heart was never at peace. Being then in a book|&s;eller's &s;hop, I &s;aw the account of the church at Hernhuth. I did not think there could be any &s;uch place, and a&s;ked the book&s;eller, if that was a real ac|count? His an&s;wer, "That it was no more than the plain truth," threw me into deep thought, and fervent prayer, that God would bring me to that place. I went to the Secretary, and told him, "I did not de|&s;ign to &s;tay at Up&s;al, having a de&s;ire to travel." He &s;aid, "He had a de&s;ire his &s;on &s;hould travel, and was glad of an opportunity to &s;end him with me." I was grieved but knew not how to refu&s;e any thing to my patron and benefactor. Accordingly we left Up&s;al together, and after a year &s;pent in &s;everal parts of Germany, went through Holland into France, and &s;o to Paris, where we &s;pent another year. But I was more and more unea&s;y till I could be di&s;engaged from my charge, that I might retire to Hernhuth. In our return from France, my pupil's elder brother return|ing from Italy met us at Leip&s;ig. I immediately writ to his father, and having obtained his con&s;ent, delivered him into his hands.</P>
<P>April 23, 1738, (N. S.) I came hither. Here I was as in another world. I de&s;ired nothing but to be clean&s;ed inwardly and outwardly from &s;in, by the
<PB N="184" REF="029861_0182_0FE2AAAF16AF1548">blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. I found all here laying the &s;ame foundation. Therefore, though I did not think with them in all points of doctrine, I waved the&s;e, and &s;ingly pur&s;ued reconciliation with God through Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>On the 22d of May la&s;t, I could think of nothing but, <HI>He that believeth hath everla&s;ting life.</HI> But I was afraid of deceiving my&s;elf, and continually prayed I might not build without a foundation. Yet I had a &s;weet, &s;ettled peace, and for five days this &s;cripture was always in my thoughts. On the 28th tho&s;e words of our Lord were as &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed upon me, <HI>"If ye being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more &s;hall your heavenly Father give the Holy Gho&s;t to them that a&s;k him."</HI> At the &s;ame time I was ince&s;&s;antly carried out, to a&s;k, that he would give me the witne&s;s of his Spirit. Or the 29th I had what I a&s;ked of him, viz. the <GAP DESC="foreign">, which is,</P>

<P N="2">2. They have deacons, or helpers, who are in the private a&s;&s;emblies, to in&s;truct: to take care that out|ward things be done decently and in order; and to &s;ee that every member of the church grows in grace, and walks &s;uitable to his holy calling.</P>
<P N="3">3.

<P N="4">4. We have al&s;o another &s;ort of <HI>deacons</HI> who take care that nothing be wanting to the orphan-hou&s;e, the poor, the &s;ick, and the &s;trangers. Others again there are, who are peculiarly to take care of the &s;ick; and others, of the poor. And two of the&s;e are intru&s;ted with the public &s;tock, and keep accounts of all that is received or expended.</P>
<P N="5">5.

<P N="6">6. Towards magi&s;trates, whether of a &s;uperior or inferior rank, we bear the greate&s;t reverence. We cheerfully &s;ubmit to their laws; and even when many
<PB N="189" REF="029861_0187_0FE2AAC093F6A438">of us have been &s;poiled of their goods, driven out of their hou&s;es, and every way oppre&s;&s;ed by them, yet they re&s;i&s;ted them not, neither opening their mouths, nor lift|ing up their hands again&s;t them. In all things which do act immediately concern the inward, &s;piritual kingdom of Chri&s;t, we &s;imply, and without contradicting, obey the higher powers. But with regard to con&s;cience, the liber|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty of this we cannot &s;uffer to be any way limited or in|fringed. And to this head we refer whatever directly and in it&s;elf tends to hinder the &s;alvation of &s;ouls: or, what&s;oever things Chri&s;t and his holy apo&s;tles (who we know meddled not with outward worldly things) took charge of, and performed, as nece&s;&s;ary for the con&s;tituting and well-ordering of his church. In the&s;e things we acknowledge no head but Chri&s;t; and are determined, God being our helper, to give up, not only our goods (as we did before) but life it&s;elf, ra|ther than this liberty which God hath given us.</P>
<P N="7">7. As it behoves all Chri&s;tians not to be &s;lothful in bu&s;ine&s;s, but diligently to attend the works of their calling; there are per&s;ons cho&s;en by the church, to &s;uperintend all tho&s;e who are employed in outward bu&s;ine&s;s.

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This work all the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ie brethren and &s;i&s;ters, as well as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> in their turns.</NOTE> The&s;e larger are al&s;o (now) divided into near ninety &s;maller cla&s;&s;es or bands, over each of which one pre|&s;ides who is of the greate&s;t experience.

<P N="10">10. In the year 1727, four and twenty men and as many women agreed, That each of them would &s;pend an hour in every day, in praying to God for his ble&s;&s;ing on his people: and for this purpo&s;e both the men and the women cho&s;e a place, where any of their own &s;ex, who were in di&s;tre&s;s, might be pre|&s;ent with them. The &s;ame number of unmarried wo|men, of unmarried men, of boys, and of girls, were afterwards at their de&s;ire, added to them; who pour out their &s;ouls before God, not only for their own brethren, but al&s;o for other churches and per&s;ons, that have de&s;ired to be mentioned in their prayers. And this perpetual interce&s;&s;ion has never cea&s;ed day or night &s;ince its fir&s;t beginning.</P>

Tho&s;e who are &s;till dead, are vi&s;ited every day. And of the babes in Chri&s;t e&s;pecial care is taken al&s;o, that they may be daily in&s;pected and a&s;&s;i&s;ted to grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord Je&s;us,</P>

In the Orphan-hou&s;e, about &s;eventy children are brought up &s;eparate, according to their &s;ex: be|&s;ide which, &s;everal experienced per&s;ons are appointed to con&s;ult with the parents, touching the education of the other children. In teaching them Chri&s;tianity, we make u&s;e of Luther's catechi&s;m, and &s;tudy the a|mending their wills as well as their under&s;tanding; finding by experience, that when their will is moved, they often learn more in a few hours, than otherwi&s;e in many months. Our little children we in&s;truct chief|ly by hymns; whereby we find the mo&s;t important truths mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sfully in&s;inuated into their minds.</P>
<P N="13">13. We highly reverence marriage, as greatly con|ducive to the kingdom of Chri&s;t. But neither our young men nor women enter into it till they a&s;&s;uredly know, they are married to Chri&s;t. When any know it is the will of God, that they &s;hould change their &s;tate, both the man and woman are placed for a time, with &s;ome married per&s;ons, who in&s;truct them how to behave, &s;o that their married life may be plea&s;ing to God. Then their de&s;ign is laid before the whole church, and after about fourteen days, they are &s;o|lemnly joined, though not otherwi&s;e habited, than they are at other times. If they make any entertain|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nt (which is not always) they invite only a few in|timate friends, by who&s;e faithful admonitions they may be the better prepared to bear their cro&s;s and fight the good fight of faith. If any woman is with child, not only e&s;pecial mention is made of her in the public prayers, but &s;he is al&s;o exhorted in private, wholly to give her&s;elf up into the hands of her faith|ful Creator. As &s;oon as a child is born, prayer is made for it, and if it may be, it is baptized in the pre&s;ence of the whole church. Before it is weaned, it is brought into the a&s;&s;embly on the Lord's days.</P>
<P N="14">14. Whoever either of the male or female children, &s;eek God with their whole heart, need not be much

<P N="15">15. Once or twice a month, either at Berthold&s;|dorf, or if it may be, at Hernhuth, all the church re|ceives the Lord's &s;upper. It cannot be expre&s;&s;ed how great the power of God is then pre&s;ent among us. A general confe&s;&s;ion of &s;ins is made by one of the bre|thren in the name of all. Then a few &s;olid que&s;tions are a&s;ked; which when they have an&s;wered, the ab&s;o|lution or remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins is either pronounced <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o all in general, or confirmed to every particular per&s;on, by the laying on of hands. The &s;eniors fir&s;t receive; then the re&s;t in order, without any regard had to world|ly dignity, in this, any more than in any other of the &s;olemn offices of religion. After receiving, all the men (and &s;o the women) meet together, to renew their covenant with God, to &s;eek his face, and exhort one another to the patience of hope and the labour of love.</P>
<P N="16">16. They have a peculiar e&s;teem for lots, and ac|cordingly u&s;e them both in public and private, to de|cide points of importance, when the rea&s;ons brought on each &s;ide appear to be of equal weight.

<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. WHEN at fir&s;t men began to &s;ay to my charge, things which I knew not, I often thought, "Had I but two or three intimate friends, who knew what my life and conver&s;ation were, they might ea&s;ily &s;peak what they had &s;een and heard, and all &s;uch a&s;per&s;ions would fall to the ground." But I perceived my mi&s;take, as &s;oon as I had two or three, who were my friends indeed, not in name only. For a way was ea&s;ily found to prevent their being of any &s;uch u&s;e as I once imagined they would be. This was done at a &s;troke, and that once for all, by giving them and me a <HI>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w name:</HI> a name, which however in&s;ignificant in it&s;elf, yet had this peculiar effect, ut|terly to di&s;able me from removing, whatever accu&s;a|tion might for the time to come be ca&s;t upon me, by invalidating all which tho&s;e who knew me be&s;t, were able to &s;ay in my behalf: nay, which any others could &s;ay. For how notorious is it, that if any man dare to open his mouth in my favour, it needs only be replied, "I &s;uppo&s;e you are a <HI>Methodi&s;t</HI> too," and all he has &s;aid is to pa&s;s for nothing.</P>
<P N="2">2. Hence, on the one hand, many who knew what my conver&s;ation was, were afraid to declare the truth; le&s;t the &s;ame reproach &s;hould fall upon them: and the&s;e few who broke through this fear, were &s;oon di&s;abled from declaring it with effect, by being im|mediately ranked with him they defended. What im|partial man then can refu&s;e to &s;ay, <HI>It is permitted to
<PB N="198" REF="029861_0195_0FE2AAD6314F4E68">thee to an&s;wer for thy&s;elf?</HI> Only do not add, but, "Thou <HI>&s;halt not</HI> per&s;uade me, though thou <HI>do&s;t</HI> per|&s;uade me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> I am re&s;olved to think as I did before." Not &s;o, if you are a candid man. You have heard one &s;ide already. Hear the other. Weigh both. Al|low for human weakne&s;s. And then judge as you de|&s;ire to be judged.</P>
<P N="3">3. What I de&s;ign in the following extract is, open|ly to declare to all mankind, what it is that the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">s</HI> (&s;o called) have done, and are doing now; or rather, what it is that God hath done, and is &s;till doing in our land. For it is not the work of man which hath lately appeared. All who calmly ob&s;erve it mu&s;t &s;ay, <HI>This is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Such a work this hath been in many re&s;pects, as neither we nor our fathers had known. Not a few who&s;e &s;ins were of the mo&s;t flagrant kind, drunk|ards, &s;wearers, thieves, whoremongers, adulterers, have been brought <HI>from darkne&s;s unto light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</HI> Many of the&s;e were rooted in their wickedne&s;s, having long gloried in their &s;hame, perhaps for a cour&s;e of many years, yea, even to hoary hairs. Many had not &s;o much as a no|tional faith, being Jews, A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ians, Dei&s;ts or Athei&s;ts. Nor has God only made bare his arm in the&s;e la&s;t days, in behalf of open Publicans and Sinners; but many <HI>of the Phari&s;ees</HI> al&s;o <HI>have believed on him,</HI> of the <HI>righteous that needed no repentance:</HI> and having <HI>received the &s;entence of death in them&s;elves, have then heard the voice that rai&s;eth the dead:</HI> have been made partakers of an inward, vital religion, even <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s, and peace, and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. The manner wherein God hath wrought this work in many &s;ouls, is as &s;trange as the work it&s;elf. It has gene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ly if not alway<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, been wrought in one moment. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as the lightning &s;hining from heaven,</HI> &s;o was
<PB N="199" REF="029861_0196_0FE2AAD7C5E2E5A0"><HI>the coming of the Son of Man,</HI> either to bring peace or a &s;word; either to wound or to heal, either to con|vince of &s;in, or to give remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins in his blood. And the other circum&s;tances attending it have been equally remote from what human wi&s;dom would have expected. So true is that word, <HI>My ways are not as your ways, nor my thoughts as your thoughts.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. The&s;e extraordinary circum&s;tances &s;eem to have been de&s;igned by God, for the further manife&s;tation of his work, to cau&s;e his power to be known, and to awaken the attention of a drow&s;y world. And yet even from the&s;e, &s;ome have drawn their grand ob|jection again&s;t the whole work. <HI>We never &s;aw it,</HI> &s;ay they, <HI>on this fa&s;hion. Therefore,</HI> the work is not of God. To prove which farther, they have not only greatly mi&s;repre&s;ented many circum&s;tances that really were, but have added many that were not, often with|out any regard either to truth or probability. A bare re|cital of tho&s;e facts which were <HI>not done in a corner,</HI> is the be&s;t an&s;wer to this &s;ort of objections. To tho&s;e which have been judged to be of more weight, I have occa&s;ionally given a more particular an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Yet I know even this will by no means &s;atisfy the far greater part of tho&s;e who are now offended. And for a plain rea&s;on, becau&s;e they <HI>will never read it:</HI> they are re&s;olved to hear one &s;ide, and one only. I know al&s;o, that many who <HI>do</HI> read it, will be ju&s;t of the &s;ame mind they were before; becau&s;e they have fixed their judgment already, and <HI>do not regard any thing which &s;uch a fellow can &s;ay.</HI> Let them &s;ee to that. I have done my part. I have delivered mine own &s;oul. Nay, I know that many will be greatly offended at this very account. It mu&s;t be &s;o from the very na|ture of the things, which are therein related. And the be&s;t appellation I expect from them is, that of a fool, a madman, an enthu&s;ia&s;t. All that in me lies is, to relate &s;imple truth, in as inoffen&s;ive a manner
<PB N="200" REF="029861_0197_0FE2AADB08F98FC8">as I can. Let God give it the effect which plea&s;eth him, and which is mo&s;t for his glory!</P>
<P N="7">7.

<P>SATURDAY, Aug. 12. About &s;even in the evening we came to Neu-Kirche, a town about twenty-four miles from Hernhuth. Mr. Schneider (the mini&s;ter of it who had de&s;ired us to take his hou&s;e in our way) was not at home: but we found one Mr. Manoetius there, the mini&s;ter of a neighbour|ing town, who walked with us in the morning ten miles to Hau&s;wald<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, where he lived. He told us, "That the Lutherans as well as the Papi&s;ts, were ir|reconcilable enemies to the brethren of Hernhuth: that the generality of the Lutheran clergy, were as bitter again&s;t them as the Je&s;uits them&s;elves: that none of his neighbours dur&s;t go thither (unle&s;s by &s;tealth) being &s;ure of &s;uffering for it, if di&s;covered; that to prevent any of Hernhuth from coming to them, the Elector had forbid, under a &s;evere penalty, any number of per&s;ons, exceeding three, to meet together on a religious account; and that he him&s;elf, for hav|ing a little &s;ociety in his own pari&s;h, had been &s;um|moned to appear before the Con&s;i&s;tory at Dre&s;den." Yea, let the <HI>kings of the earth &s;tand up, and the rulers take coun&s;el together again&s;t the Lord and again&s;t his a|nointed! He that &s;itteth in heaven &s;hall laugh them to &s;corn; the Lord &s;hall have them in deri&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>We left Hau&s;walde in the afternoon, and in the evening came to Dre&s;den. But the officer at the gate would not &s;uffer us to come in; &s;o that we were
<PB N="202" REF="029861_0199_0FE2AAE16960E540">obliged to go on to the next village: which leaving early in the morning, on Thur&s;day in the afternoon we came to Leip&s;ig.</P>
<P>We were now kept only an hour at the gate, and then conducted to Mr. Arnold's, who had invited us when we were in the town before, to make his hou&s;e our home. A few we found here too, who de&s;ire to <HI>know nothing but Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and him cru|cified.</HI> And from them we had letters to Halle, whi|ther we came on Friday 18. But the king of Pru&s;&s;ia's tall men (who kept the gates) would not &s;uffer Mr. Brown to come in. Me they admitted (in honour of my profe&s;&s;ion) after I had waited about two hours: and one of them we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t with me to the Prince of He&s;&s;e, who after a few que&s;tions, gave me leave to lodge in the city. Thence he &s;hewed me to Mr Got&s;|ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lck's lodgings, to whom I had letters from Leip|&s;ig. He read them and &s;aid, <HI>My brother, what you find here, you will u&s;e as your own. And if you want any thing el&s;e, tell us and you &s;hall have it.</HI></P>
<P>I told them, "My companion was without the gate." They &s;oon procured admittance for him. And we were indeed as at home; for I have hard|ly &s;een &s;uch little children as the&s;e, even at Hern|huth.</P>
<P>Satur. 19. I waited on Profe&s;&s;or Francke, who behaved with the utmo&s;t humanity; and afterwards on Profe&s;&s;or Knappe, to whom al&s;o I am indebted for his open, friendly behaviour. Between ten and eleven, &s;even of the brethren &s;et out with us, one of whom went with us two days journey. It was the du&s;k of the evening on Sunday 20, when, wet and weary, we reached Jena.</P>
<P>Mond. 21. We vi&s;ited the &s;chools there; the ri&s;e of which (as we were informed) was occa&s;ioned thus:</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="029861_0200_0FE2AAE2F751DD80">
About the year 1704 Mr. Stoltius, a &s;tudent at Jena, began to &s;peak of <HI>faith</HI> in Chri&s;t; which he continued to do, till he took his ma&s;ter's degree, and read public lectures. About twelve or fifteen &s;tudents were awakened, and joined with him in prayer and building up one another. At this (after various ca|lumnies &s;pread abroad and divers per&s;ecutions occa&s;i|oned thereby) the Con&s;i&s;tory was offended, and i&s;&s;u|ed out a commi&s;&s;ion to examine him. In con&s;equence of the report made to the Con&s;i&s;tory by the&s;e commi&s;|&s;ioners, he was forbid to read any public lectures, or to hold any meetings with his friends. Not long af|ter an order was given, by which he was excluded from the holy communion. He was al&s;o to have been expelled the univer&s;ity: but this he prevented by a voluntary retirement.</P>
<P>Yet one of the commi&s;&s;ioners, who had been &s;ent by the Duke of Weymar (one of the Lords of Jena) informed the Duke, that according to his judgment Stoltius was an innocent and holy man. On this the Duke &s;ent for him to Weymar, and fixed him in a living there. There likewi&s;e he awakened many, and met with them to pray and read the &s;criptures toge|ther. But it was not long that the city could bear him. For he boldly rebuked all vice, and that in all per&s;ons, neither &s;paring the courtiers, nor the Duke him&s;elf. Con&s;equently, his enemies every where in|crea&s;ed, and many per&s;ecutions followed. In fine, he was forbid to have any private meetings, and was to have been depo&s;ed from the mini&s;try; when God call|ing him to him&s;elf, took him away from the evil to come.</P>
<P>Before Stoltius left Jena, Boddaeus al&s;o began to preach the real go&s;pel, as did Chri&s;tius &s;oon after; whereby &s;ome awakening continued till the year 1724. A few of the town&s;men then agreed, to maintain a &s;tudent, to be a &s;choolma&s;ter for &s;ome poor children.
<PB N="204" REF="029861_0201_0FE2AAE58437E138">They afterwards kept &s;everal &s;choolma&s;ters: But a|bout 1728, all of them going away, the &s;chool was broke up, and the children quite neglected. Profe&s;|&s;or Buddaeus being informed of this, earne&s;tly recom|mended the con&s;ideration of it to the &s;tudents in his hou&s;e: and about ten of them, among whom was Mr. Spangenberg, took upon them&s;elves the care of tho&s;e children. Their number &s;oon increa&s;ed, which gave great offence to the other &s;chool-ma&s;ters in the town; and not long after to the magi&s;trates of the town, and to the &s;enate of the univer&s;ity. The offence &s;oon &s;pread to the pa&s;tors, the profe&s;&s;ors, the con&s;i&s;tory, and the princes who are lords of Jena. But it plea&s;|ed God to move one of them, the prince of Ei&s;nach, who had the chief power there, to &s;top the open per|&s;ecution, by forbidding either the &s;enate or con&s;i&s;tory to mole&s;t them. He likewi&s;e wholly exempted them from the juri&s;diction of both, ordering that all com|plaints again&s;t them for the time to come &s;hould be cognizable only by him&s;elf. But during the per&s;ecu|tion, the number of &s;chools was increa&s;ed from one to three, (one in each &s;uburb of the city) the number of teachers to above thirty, and of children to above three hundred.</P>
<P>There are now thirty con&s;tant teachers, ten in each &s;chool, and three or four &s;upernumerary, to &s;upply accidental defects. Four of the ma&s;ters are appoint|ed to puni&s;h, who are affixed to no one &s;chool. Each of the &s;chools being divided into two cla&s;&s;es, and taught five hours a day, every one of the thirty ma&s;|ters has one hour in a day to teach. All the ma&s;ters have a conference about the &s;chools every Monday. They have a &s;econd meeting on Thur&s;day, chiefly for prayers. And a third every Saturday.</P>
<P>Once in half a year they meet to fill up the places <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> tho&s;e ma&s;ters who are gone away. And the num|ber
<PB N="205" REF="029861_0202_0FE2AAECDCE95A18">has never decrea&s;ed; fre&s;h ones &s;till offering them|&s;elves, as the former leave the univer&s;ity.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent method wherein they teach is this.</P>
<P>There are always two cla&s;&s;es in each &s;chool. In the lower, children from &s;ix to ten or twelve years old are taught to read. They are then removed to the other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">a&s;s, in which are taught, the holy &s;criptures, arith|metic, and whatever el&s;e it may be u&s;eful for children to learn.</P>
<P>In the morning from eight to nine they are all ca|techized, and in&s;tructed in the fir&s;t principles of Chri|&s;tianity, either from Luther's &s;maller catechi&s;m, or from &s;ome texts of holy &s;cripture.</P>
<P>From nine to ten the &s;maller children are taught their letters and &s;yllables; and the larger read the bi|ble. From ten to eleven tho&s;e in the lower cla&s;s learn and repeat &s;ome &s;elect ver&s;es of holy &s;cripture, chiefly relating to the foundation of the faith. Mean while tho&s;e in the upper, learn arithmetic.</P>
<P>In the afternoon from one to two all the children are employed as from nine to ten in the morning. From two to three the &s;maller children learn and re|peat Luther's &s;maller catechi&s;m, while the larger are taught to write.</P>
<P>Every Sunday there is a public catechizing on &s;ome text of &s;cripture; at which all per&s;ons who de&s;ire it may be pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>In the afternoon we left Jena, &s;everal of the bre|thren accompanying us out of town. At five hav|ing ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed through Weymar, we met Mr. Ing|ham going for Hernhuth. We all turned a&s;ide to a neighbouring village, where having &s;pent a comforta|ble evening together, in the morning we commended each other to the grace of God, and went on our &s;e|veral ways.</P>
<P>We breakfa&s;ted at Erfurt with Mr. Reinhart, &s;pent the evening with &s;ome Brethren at Saxe-Gotha, and
<PB N="206" REF="029861_0203_0FE2AAEE884FBF20">by long journeys came to Marienborn on Friday, Au|gu&s;t 25.</P>
<P>Monday 28, I took my leave of the Counte&s;s (the Count being gone to Jena) and &s;etting out early the next morning came about three in the afternoon to Frankfort. From Mr. Bohler's we went to the &s;oci|ety, where one of the brethren from Marienborn offer|ed free redemption through the blood of Chri&s;t to &s;ix|ty or &s;eventy per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day 30. In the afternoon we came to Mentz, and agreed for our pa&s;&s;age to Colen by wa|ter, for a florin per head: which was but half what we gave before, though (it &s;eems) twice as much as we ought to have given.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day 31. We &s;pent half an hour in the great church, a huge heap of irregular building; full of al|tars, adorned (or loaded rather) with abundance of gold and &s;ilver. In going out, we ob&s;erved a paper on the door, which was of &s;o extraordinary a nature, that I thought it would not be labour lo&s;t to tran&s;cribe it. The words were as follow:
<Q>Vollkommener abla&s;s fur die arme &s;eelen im feg-&s;eur.</Q></P>

<P>Now I de&s;ire to know, whether any Romani&s;t of common &s;en&s;e, can either defend or approve of this?</P>
<P>At eight we took boat, and on Saturday, Sept. 2, about eleven came to Colen; which we left at one, and between &s;even and eight reached a village, an hour &s;hort of Neus. Here we overtook a large num|ber of Switzers, men, women and children, &s;inging, dancing and making merry, being all going <HI>to make their fortunes in Georgia.</HI> Looking upon them as deli|vered into my hands by God, I plainly told them, what manner of place it was. If they now leap in|to the fire with open eyes, their blood is on their own head.</P>
<P>Mond. 4. Before noon we came to Cleve, and to Nimwegen in the evening. The next night we lay at a little village near Tiel; which leaving early in the morning, we walked by the &s;ide of many plea&s;ant or|chards, and in the afternoon came to Y&s;&s;el&s;tein. We &s;tayed only one night with the brethren, (in the new hou&s;e, called Herndyke, an Engli&s;h mile from the town) and ha&s;ting forward came the next afternoon to Dr. Koker's at Rotterdam.</P>
<P>I cannot but acknowledge the civility of this friend|ly man, all the time we &s;tayed in his hou&s;e. In the morning, Frid. 8, we went to the Engli&s;h epi&s;copal church, which is a large, hand&s;ome, convenient build|ing.
<PB N="208" REF="029861_0205_0FE2AAF1A5467EE8">The mini&s;ter read prayers &s;eriou&s;ly and di&s;tinct|ly, to a &s;mall, well-behaved congregation. Being informed our &s;hip was to &s;ail the next day (Satur|day) we took leave of our generous friend, and went to an inn clo&s;e to the key, that we might be ready when called to go aboard. Having waited till pa&s;t four in the afternoon, we &s;tepped into the Jews &s;yna|gogue, which lies near the water-&s;ide. I do not won|der that &s;o many Jews (e&s;pecially tho&s;e who have any re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ection) utterly abjure all religon.

Lord, do not thou yet <HI>ca&s;t off thy people!</HI> But <HI>in Abraham's &s;eed let them al&s;o be ble&s;&s;ed!</HI></P>
<P>The &s;hip lingering &s;till, I had time to exhort &s;e|veral Engli&s;h, whom we met with at our inn, to pur|&s;ue inward religion; the renewal of their &s;ouls in righteou&s;ne&s;s and true holine&s;s. In the morning a daughter of affliction came to &s;ee me, who teaches a &s;chool at Rotterdam. She had been for &s;ome time under deep convictions; but could find none to in|&s;truct or comfort her. After much conver&s;ation, we joined in prayer, and her &s;pirit a little revived. Be|tween nine and ten we went on board. In the after|noon I read prayers, and preached in the great cabin. The wind being contrary, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> did not get out of the river till Wedne&s;day; nor to London till Saturday night.</P>
<P>Sunday, Sept. 17. I began again to declare in my own country the glad tidings of &s;alvation, preach|ing three times, and afterwards expounding the holy &s;cripture to a large company in the Minories. On Monday I rejoiced to meet with our little &s;ociety, which now con&s;i&s;ted of 32 per&s;ons. The next day I went to the condemned felons in Newgate, and offer|ed them free &s;alvation. In the evening I went to a &s;ociety in Bear-yard, and preached repentance and
<PB N="209" REF="029861_0206_0FE2AAFAC410A640"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of &s;ins. The next evening I &s;poke the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">th in love at a &s;ociety in Alder&s;gate-&s;treet. Some contradicted at fir&s;t; but not long: &s;o that nothing but love appeared at our parting.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day, 21. I went to a &s;ociety in Gutterlane; but I could not declare the mighty works of God there; as I did afterwards at the Savoy in all &s;impli|city. And the word did not return empty.</P>
<P>Finding abundance of people greatly exa&s;perated by gro&s;s mi&s;repre&s;entations of the words I had &s;poken, I went to as many of them in private, as my time would permit. God gave me much love towards them all. Some were convinced they had been mi&s;taken. And who knoweth but God will &s;oon return to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;t, and leave a ble&s;&s;ing behind him?</P>
<P>On Sat. 23. I was enabled to &s;peak &s;trong words both at Newgate and Mr. E's &s;ociety; and the next day at St. Anne's, and twice at St. John's Clerken|well: &s;o that I fear they will bear me there no longer.</P>
<P>Tue&s;. 26. I declared the go&s;pel of peace to a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">all company at Wind&s;or.

<P>Sat. 30. One who had been a zealous oppo&s;er of <HI>this way,</HI> &s;ent and de&s;ired to &s;peak with me immediately. He had all the &s;igns of &s;ettled de&s;pair, both in his coun|tenance and behaviour. He &s;aid, "He had been in|&s;laved to &s;in many years, e&s;pecially to drunkenne&s;s; that he had long u&s;ed all the means of grace, had con&s;tantly gone to church, and &s;acrament, had read the &s;cripture, and u&s;ed much private prayer, and yet was nothing profited." I de&s;ired we might join in prayer. After a &s;hort &s;pace he ro&s;e and his counte|nance was no longer &s;ad. He &s;aid, "Now I know, God loveth <HI>me,</HI> and has forgiven <HI>my</HI> &s;ins. And &s;in &s;hall not have dominion over me: for Chri&s;t hath &s;et me free." And according to his faith it was unto him.</P>
<P>Sund. Oct. 1. I preached both morning and after|noon at St. George's in the Ea&s;t. On the following days I endeavoured to explain the way of &s;alvation, to many who had mi&s;under&s;tood what had been preach|ed concerning it.</P>
<P>Frid. 6. I preached at St. Antholin's once more. In the afternoon I went to the Rev. Mr. Bedford, to tell him between me and him alone, of the injury he had done both to: God and his brother, by preach|ing
<PB N="211" REF="029861_0208_0FE2AAFC53A403E0">and printing that very weak &s;ermon on a&s;&s;urance, which was an <HI>ignoratio clenchi</HI> from beginning to end; &s;eeing the a&s;&s;urance we preach is of quite another bind from that he writes again&s;t. We &s;peak of an a&s;&s;urance <HI>of our pre&s;ent pardon;</HI> not (as he does) <HI>of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> final per&s;everance.</HI></P>
<P>In the evening I began expounding at a little &s;o|ciety in Wapping. On Sunday 8. I preached at the Savoy chapel (I &s;uppo&s;e the la&s;t time) on the parable (or hi&s;tory rather) of the Phari&s;ee and Publican pray|ing in the temple. On Mond. 9. I &s;et out for Ox|ford. In walking I read the truly &s;urprizing narra|tive of the conver&s;ions lately wrought in and about the town of Northampton in New-England. Surely <HI>this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes!</HI></P>
<P>An extract from this I wrote to a friend, concerning the &s;tate of tho&s;e who are <HI>weak in faith.</HI> His an|&s;wer, which I received at Bri&s;tol, on Sat. 14, threw me into great perplexity, till after crying to God, I took up a bible, which opened on the&s;e words; <HI>And Ja<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">z called on the God of I&s;rael, &s;aying, Oh, that thou would&s;t ble&s;s me indeed, and inlarge my coa&s;t! And that thine hand might be with me, and that thou would&s;t keep me from evil that it may not grieve me! And God granted him that which he reque&s;ted.</HI></P>
<P>This however, with a &s;entence in the evening le&s;&s;on, put me upon con&s;idering my own &s;tate more deeply. And what then occurred to me was as follows:</P>
<P>"Examine your&s;elves, whether ye be in the faith." Now the &s;ure&s;t te&s;t whereby we can examine our|&s;elves, whether we be indeed in the faith, is that given by St. Paul, <HI>If any man be in Chri&s;t, he is a new creature. Old things are pa&s;t away. Behold all things are become new.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t, His judgments are new his judgment of him&s;elf, of happine&s;s, of holine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="029861_0209_0FE2AAFDF4EF1DF0">
He judges him&s;elf to be altogether fallen &s;hort <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f the glorious image of God. To have no good thing abiding in him; but all that is corrupt and abomina|ble: in a word, to be wholly earthly, &s;en&s;ual, and devili&s;h: a motly mixture of bea&s;t and devil.</P>
<P>Thus, by the grace of God in Chri&s;t, I judge of my&s;elf. Therefore I am, in this re&s;pect, a new creature.</P>
<P>Again. His judgment concerning happine&s;s is new. He would as &s;oon expect to dig it out of the earth, as to find it in riches, honor, plea&s;ure (&s;o call|ed) or indeed in the enjoyment of any creature: he knows there can be no happine&s;s on earth, but in the enjoyment of God, and in the foreta&s;te of tho&s;e <HI>rivers of plea&s;ure which flow at his right-hand for evermore.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, by the grace of God in Chri&s;t, I judge of happine&s;s. Therefore I am, in this re&s;pect, a new creature.</P>
<P>Yet again. His judgment concerning holine&s;s is now. He no longer judge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it to be an outward thing: to con&s;i&s;t either, in doing no harm, in doing good, or in u&s;ing the ordinances of God. He &s;ees it is, the life of God in the &s;oul; the image of God fre&s;h &s;tamped on the heart: an entire renewal of the mind in every temper and thought, after the likene&s;s of him that created it.</P>
<P>Thus, by the grace of God in Chri&s;t, I judge of holine&s;s. Therefore I am, in this re&s;pect, a new creature.</P>
<P>Secondly, His de&s;ign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> are new. It is the de&s;ign of his life, not to heap up trea&s;ures upon earth, not to gain the prai&s;e of men, not to indulge the de&s;ires of the fle&s;h, the de&s;ire of the eye, or the pride o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> life; but to regain the image of God; to have the life of God again planted in his &s;oul; and to be re|newed
<PB N="213" REF="029861_0210_0FE2AAFF864E0F38">after his likene&s;s, in righteou&s;ne&s;s and all t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ue holine&s;s.</P>
<P>This, by the grace of God in Chri&s;t, is the de|&s;ign of my life. Therefore I am, in this re&s;pect, a new creature.</P>
<P>Thirdly, His de&s;ires are new, and indeed the whole train of his pa&s;&s;ions and inclinations. They are no longer fixed on earthly things. They are now &s;et on the things of heaven. His love, and joy, and hope, his &s;orrow, and fear, have all re&s;pect to things above. They all point heaven-w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rd. Where his trea&s;ure is, there is his heart al&s;o.</P>
<P>I dare not &s;ay I am a new creature in this re&s;pect. For other de&s;ires often <HI>ari&s;e</HI> in my heart. But they do not <HI>reign.</HI> I put them all under my feet through Chri&s;t which &s;trengtheneth me. Therefore I believe he is <HI>creating</HI> me anew in this al&s;o, and that he has be|gun, though not fini&s;hed, his work.</P>
<P>Fourthly, His conver&s;ation is new. It <HI>is always &s;ea&s;oned with &s;alt, and fit to mini&s;ter grace to the bearers.</HI></P>
<P>So is mine, by the grace of God in Chri&s;t. There|fore, in this re&s;pect, I am a new creature.</P>
<P>Fifthly, His actions are new. The tenor of his life &s;ingly points at the glory of God. All his &s;ub|&s;tance and time are devoted thereto. <HI>Whether he eats or drinks, or whatever he does,</HI> it either &s;prings from, or leads to, the love of God and man.</P>
<P>Such, by the grace of God in Chri&s;t, is the tenor of my life. Therefore, in this re&s;pect, I am a new creature.</P>
<P>But St. Paul tells us el&s;ewhere, that <HI>the fruit of the Spirit is love, peace, joy, long-&s;uffering, gentlene&s;s, meek|ne&s;s, temperance.</HI> Now although, by the grace of God in Chri&s;t, I find a mea&s;ure of &s;ome of the&s;e in my|&s;elf, viz. of peace, long-&s;uffering, gentlene&s;s, meek|ne&s;s, temperance: yet others I find not. I cannot
<PB N="214" REF="029861_0211_0FE2AB0B5F9FB018">find in my&s;elf the love of God or of Chri&s;t. Hence my deadne&s;s and wanderings in public prayer. Hence it is that even in the holy communion, I have fre|quently no more than a cold attention.</P>
<P>Again, I have not that joy in the Holy Gho&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> no &s;ettled, la&s;ting joy. Nor have I &s;uch a peace as excludes the po&s;&s;ibility either of fear or doubt. When holy men have told me, "I had no faith," I have often doubted, whether I had or no. And tho&s;e doubts have made me very unea&s;y, till I wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> relieved by prayer and the holy &s;criptures.</P>
<P>Yet upon the whole, although I have not yet that joy in the Holy Gho&s;t, nor the full a&s;&s;urance of faith, much le&s;s am I, in the full &s;en&s;e of the words, <HI>in Chri&s;t a new creature:</HI> I neverthele&s;s tru&s;t that I have a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> mea&s;ure of faith, and am <HI>accepted in the Beloved:</HI> I tru&s;t, <HI>the hand-writing that was again&s;t me is blotted out,</HI> and that I am <HI>reconciled to God</HI> through his Son.</P>
<P>Sund. 15. I preached twice at the ca&s;tle, and afterwards expounded at three &s;ocieties. Wedne&s;day evening I came to London again, and on Friday met a &s;ociety (of &s;oldiers chiefly) at We&s;tmin&s;ter. On Sunday 22, I preached at Bloom&s;bury in the morning, and at Shadwell in the afternoon. Wedne&s;day 25, I preached at Ba&s;ing&s;haw church: on Friday morning at St. Antholin's: on Sunday at I&s;lington and at London-Wall.</P>
<P>In the evening being troubled at what &s;ome &s;aid, of <HI>the kingdom of God within us,</HI> and doubtful of my own &s;tate, I called upon God, and received this an|&s;wer from his word, <HI>He him&s;elf al&s;o waited for the king|dom of God.</HI> "But &s;hould not I wait in &s;ilence and retirement?" was the thought that immediately &s;truck into my mind. I opened my te&s;tament again, on tho&s;e words, <HI>See&s;t thou not, how faith wrought toge|ther with his works? And by works was faith made perfect.</HI></P>

I preached at St. Antholin's, Sunday 5, in the morning at St. Botolph's, Bi&s;hop&s;-gate, in the afternoon at I&s;lington, and in the evening to &s;uch a congregation as I never &s;aw before, at St. Clement's in the Strand. As this was the fir&s;t time of my preaching here, I &s;uppo&s;e it is to be the la&s;t.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day my brother and I went, at their earne&s;t de&s;ire, to do the la&s;t good office to the con|demned malefactors. It was the mo&s;t glorious in&s;tance I ever &s;aw, of faith triumphing over &s;in and death. One ob&s;erving the tears run fa&s;t down the cheeks of one of them in particular, while his eyes were &s;teadily fixed upwards, a few moments before he died, a&s;ked, "How do you feel your heart now?" He calmly re|plied, "I feel a peace, which I could not have be|lieved to be po&s;&s;ible. And I know it is the peace of God, which pa&s;&s;eth all under&s;tanding."</P>
<P>My brother took that occa&s;ion of declaring the go&s;pel of peace, to a large a&s;&s;embly of publicans and &s;inners. <HI>O Lord God of my fathers,</HI> accept even <HI>me</HI> among them, and <HI>ca&s;t me not out from among thy chil|dren!</HI></P>
<P>In the evening I proclaimed mercy to my fellow-&s;inners at Ba&s;ing&s;haw church: and the next morning at St. Antholin's. Friday 10, I &s;et out, and Satur|day 11, &s;pent the evening with a little company at Oxford. I was grieved to find, <HI>prudence</HI> had made them leave off &s;inging p&s;alms. I fear it will not &s;top here. God deliver me, and all that &s;eek him in &s;in|cerity, from what the world calls <HI>Chri&s;tian prudence!</HI></P>
<P>Sunday 12. I preached twice at the ca&s;tle. In the following week, I began more narrowly to en|quire what the doctrine of the church of England is, concerning the much controverted point of ju&s;tifica|tion by FAITH. And the &s;um of what I found in the homilies, I extracted and printed for the u&s;e of others.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="029861_0213_0FE39C72C0AF8980">
Sund. 19. I only preached in the afternoon at the ca&s;tle. On Monday night I was greatly troubled in dreams, and about eleven o'clock waked in an un|accountable con&s;ternation, without being able to &s;leep again. About that time (as I found in the morning) one who had been de&s;igned to be my pupil, but was not, came into the Porter's lodge (where &s;everal per|&s;ons were &s;itting) with a pi&s;tol in his hand. He pre|&s;ented this, as in &s;port, fir&s;t at one and then at ano|ther. He then attempted twice or thrice to &s;hoot him&s;elf, but it would not go off. Upon his laying it down, one took it up, and blew out the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iming. He was very angry, went and got fre&s;h prime, came in again, &s;at down, beat the flint with his key; and about twelve, pulling off his hat and wig, &s;aid, "He would die like a gentleman," and &s;hot him&s;elf through the head.</P>
<P>Thur&s;. 23. Returning from preaching at the ca&s;|tle, I met once more with my old companion in afflic|tion, C. D. who &s;tayed with me till Monday. His la&s;t conver&s;ation with me was as follows:</P>
<P>"In this you are better than you was at Savannah. You know that you was then quite wrong. But you are not right yet. You know that you was then blind. But you do not &s;ee now.</P>
<P>"I doubt not but God <HI>will</HI> bring you to the right foundation. But I have no hope for you, while you are on your pre&s;ent foundation. It is as different from the true, as the right hand from the left. You have all to begin anew.</P>
<P>"I have ob&s;erved all your words and actions, and I &s;ee you are of the &s;ame &s;pirit &s;till. You have a &s;im|plicity: but it is a &s;implicity of your own. It is not the &s;implicity of Chri&s;t. You think you do not tru&s;t in your own works. But you do tru&s;t in your own works. You do not believe in Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="029861_0214_0FE39C6BEA14A4E0">
"You have a pre&s;ent freedom from &s;in. But it is only a temporary &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of it, not a deliverance from it. And you have a peace. But it is not a true peace. If death were to approach, you would find all your fears return.</P>
<P>"But I am forbid to &s;ay any more. My heart &s;inks in me like a &s;tone."</P>
<P>I was troubled. I begged of God an an&s;wer of peace, and opened on tho&s;e words, <HI>As many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the I&s;rael of God.</HI> I was a&s;king in the evening, that God would fulfil all his promi&s;es in my &s;oul, when I opened my te&s;tament on tho&s;e words, <HI>My hour is not yet come.</HI></P>
<P>Sund. Dec. 3. I began reading prayers at Bocar|do (the city pri&s;on) which had been long di&s;continu|ed. In the afternoon I received a letter, earne&s;tly de&s;iring me, to publi&s;h my account of Georgia: and another as earne&s;tly di&s;&s;uading me from it, "becau&s;e it would bring much trouble upon me." I con&s;ulted God in his word and received two an&s;wers; the fir&s;t Ezek. xxxiii. 2&mdash;6. The other, <HI>Thou therefore en|dure hard&s;hip, as a good &s;oldier of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Tue&s;. Dec. 5. I began reading prayers and preaching in Glouce&s;ter-green workhou&s;e, and on Thur&s;day in that belonging to St. Thomas's pari&s;h. On both days I preached at the ca&s;tle. At St. Tho|mas's was a young woman, raving mad, &s;creaming and tormenting her&s;elf continually. I had a &s;trong de&s;ire to &s;peak to her. The moment I began &s;he was &s;till. The tears ran down her cheeks all the time I was tell|ing her, "Je&s;us of Nazareth is able and willing to deliver you."

About this time, being de&s;irous to know how the work of God went on among our brethren at Lon|don, I wrote to many of them concerning the &s;tate of their &s;ouls. One or two of their an&s;wers I have &s;ubjoined.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear friend, whom I love in the truth.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Know <HI>my</HI> Saviour's voice, and my heart burns with love and de&s;ire to follow him in the regeneration. I have no confidence in the fle&s;h. I loath my&s;elf and love him only. My dear brother, my &s;pirit even at this moment rejoices in God my Saviour, and the love which is &s;hed abroad in my heart by the Holy Gho&s;t, de&s;troys all &s;elf-love, &s;o that I could lay down my life for my brethren. I know that my Redeemer liveth, and have confidence towards God, that through his blood my &s;ins are forgiven. He hath begotten me of his own will, and &s;aves me from &s;in, &s;o that it has no dominion over me. His Spirit bears witne&s;s with my &s;pirit, that I am his child by adoption and grace. And this is not for works of righteou&s;ne&s;s which I have done. For I am his workman&s;hip, created in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto good works: &s;o that all boa&s;ting is excluded.

</LETTER>
<P><HI>My mo&s;t dear and honoured father in Chri&s;t,</HI></P>
<P>IN the twentieth year of my age, 1737, God was plea&s;ed to open my eyes, and to let me &s;ee that I did not live as became a child of God. I found my &s;ins were great (though I was what they call a &s;ober per&s;on) and that God kept an account of them all. However I thought, if I repented, and led a good life, God would accept me. And &s;o I went on for about half a year, and had &s;ometimes great jay. But la&s;t winter, I began to find, that whatever I did, was nothing, and the enemy of &s;ouls laid &s;o many things to my charge, that &s;ometimes I de&s;pair|ed of heaven. I continued in great doubts and fears till April 9, when I went out of town. Here for a time I was greatly tran&s;ported, in &s;eeing the glorious works of God: but in about three weeks I was vio|lently a&s;&s;aulted again. God then offered a Savious to me, but my &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s kept me from laying hold on him.</P>
<P>On Whit&s;unday I went to receive the ble&s;&s;ed &s;acra|ment, but with a heart as hard as a &s;tone. Heavy|laden I was indeed, when God was plea&s;ed to let me &s;ee a crucified Saviour. I &s;aw there was a fountain opened in his &s;ide for me to wa&s;h in and be clean. But alas! I was afraid to venture, fearing I &s;hould but too pre&s;umptuous. And I know, I at that time
<PB N="220" REF="029861_0217_0FE2AB1AAEB2D198">refu&s;ed the atonement which I might then have hath Yet I received great comfort. But in about nine days time, my joy went out, as a lamp does for want of oil, and I fell into my old &s;tate. Yet I was not without hope; for ever after that time I could not de&s;pair of &s;alvation: I had &s;o clear a fight of the fountain opened in the &s;ide of our Lord&punc; But &s;till when I thought of death, or the day of judgment, it was a great terror to me. And yet I was afraid to venture to lay all my &s;ins upon Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>This was not all. But whenever I retired to pray|er, I had a violent pain in my head. This only &s;eized me when I began to pray earne&s;tly, or to cry out aloud to Chri&s;t. But when I cried to him again&s;t this al&s;o, he gave me ea&s;e. Well, I found God did love me, and did draw me to Chri&s;t. I hungered and thir&s;ted after him; but was &s;till afraid to go boldly to Chri&s;t, and to claim him as <HI>my</HI> Saviour.</P>
<P>July 3. My dear &s;i&s;ter came down to &s;ee me. She had received the atonement on St. Peter's day. I told her, I thought, Chri&s;t died for <HI>me,</HI> but as to the a&s;&s;urance &s;he mentioned, I could &s;ay nothing.</P>
<P>July 5. She went. That night I went into the garden, and con&s;idering what &s;he had told me, I &s;aw him by faith, who&s;e eyes are as a flame of fire, him who ju&s;tifieth the ungodly. I told him I was ungodly, and it was for <HI>me</HI> that he died. His blood did I plead with great faith, to blot out the hand-writing that was again&s;t me. I told my Saviour, that he had promi&s;ed to give re&s;t, to all that were heavy-laden. This promi&s;e I claimed, and I &s;aw him by faith, &s;tand condemned before God in my &s;tead. I &s;aw the fountain opened in his &s;ide. I found, as I hungered, he fed me: as my &s;oul thir&s;t|ed, he gave me out of that fountain to drink. And &s;o &s;trong was my faith, that if I had had all the &s;ins of the world laid upon me, I knew and was &s;ure one drop of his blood was &s;ufficient to alone for
<PB N="221" REF="029861_0218_0FE2AB1C42642AD8">all. Well, I clave unto him, and he did wa&s;h me in his blood. He heath pre&s;ented me to his Father and my Father, to his God and my God, a pure, &s;potle&s;s Virgin, as if I had never committed any &s;in, It is on Je&s;us I &s;tand, the Saviour of &s;inners. It is he that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> loved <HI>me,</HI> and given him&s;elf for <HI>me,</HI> I cleave unto him, as my &s;urety, and he is bound to pay God the debt. While I &s;tand on this rock, I am &s;ure the gates of hell cannot prevail again&s;t me. It is by faith that I am ju&s;tified, and have peace with God through him. His blood has made reconciliation to God for me. It is by faith I have received the atonement. It is by faith I have the Son of God and the Spirit of Chri&s;t dwelling in me. And what then &s;hall &s;eparate me from the love of God which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us my Lord?</P>
<P>You mu&s;t think what a tran&s;port of joy I was then in, when I that was lo&s;t and undone, dropping into hell, felt a Redeemer come, who is <HI>mighty to &s;ave, to &s;ave unto the uttermo&s;t.</HI> Yet I did not receive the wit|ne&s;s of the Spirit at that time. But in about half an hour, the devil came with great power to tempt me. However I minded him not, but went in and lay down pretty much compo&s;ed in my mind. Now St. Paul <HI>&s;ays after ye believed, ye were &s;ealed with the Spirit of Promi&s;e.</HI> So it was with me. After I had believed on him that <HI>ju&s;tifieth the ungodly,</HI> I received that &s;eal of the &s;pirit, which is the <HI>earne&s;t of our inheritance.</HI></P>
<P>July 6. In the morning, being by my&s;elf, I found the work of the &s;pirit was very powerful upon me (altho you know God does not deal with every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;ame way). As my mother bore me wi&s;h great pain, &s;o did I feel great pain in my &s;oul in being born of God. Indeed I thought the pains of death were upon me, and that my &s;oul was then tak|ing leave of the body. I thought I was going to
<PB N="222" REF="029861_0219_0FE2AB23AA17DD18">him whom I &s;aw with &s;trong faith &s;tanding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to receive me. In this violent agony I continued about four hours; and then I began to feel the <HI>&s;pirit of God bearing witne&s;s with my &s;pirit, that I was born of God. Becau&s;e I was</HI> a child of God he <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> forth the &s;pirit of his Son into me, crying, Abba, Father.</HI> For that is the cry of every new-born &s;oul. O migh|ty, powerful, happy change! I who had nothing but devils ready to drag me to hell, now found I had angels to guard me to my reconciled father, and my judge, who ju&s;t before &s;tood ready to condemn me, was now become my righteou&s;ne&s;s. But I cannot ex|pre&s;s what God hath done for my &s;oul. No; this is to be my everla&s;ting employment when I have put off this frail, finful body, when I join with that great multitude which no man can number, in &s;ing|ing prai&s;es to the Lamb that loved us, and gave him&s;elf for us! O how powerful are the workings of the Almighty in a new-born &s;oul! The love of God was &s;hed abroad in my heart, and a flame kindled there, &s;o that my body was almo&s;t torn a&s;under. I loved. The Spirit cried &s;trong in my heart. I trembled. I &s;ung. I joined my voice with tho&s;e that excel in &s;trength. My &s;oul was got up into the holy mount. I had o thoughts of coming down again into the body. I who not long before had called to the rocks to fall on me, and the moun|tains to cover me, could now call for nothing el&s;e but <HI>come,</HI> Lord Je&s;us, <HI>come quickly.</HI> Then I could cry out with great boldne&s;s, there, O God, is my &s;urety! There, O death, is thy plague! There, O grave, is thy de&s;truction! There, O &s;erpent, is the &s;eed, that &s;hall for ever brui&s;e thy head. O I thought my head was a fountain of water! I was di&s;&s;olved in love. <HI>My beloved is mins, and I am his.</HI> He has all charms. He has ravi&s;hed my heart. He is my comforter, my friend, my all. He is now in his
<PB N="223" REF="029861_0220_0FE2AB265E0618A0">garden, feeding among the lilies. <HI>O I am &s;ick of love.</HI> He is altogether lovely, <HI>the chiefe&s;t among ten thou&s;and.</HI></P>
<P>Sunday 10. I admini&s;tered the Lord's Supper at the Ca&s;tle. At one I expounded at Mr. Fox's as u&s;ual. The great power of God was with us, and one who had been in de&s;pair &s;everal years, received a witne&s;s that &s;he was a child of God.</P>
<P>Mond. 11. Hearing Mr. Whitefield was arrived from Georgia, I ha&s;tened to London; and on Tue&s;. 12. God gave us once more to take &s;weet coun&s;el together.</P>
<P>Fri. 15. I preached at St. Antholin's.</P>
<P>Sat. 16. One who had examined him&s;elf by the reflections wrote Oct. 14, made the following ob|&s;ervations on the &s;tate of his own &s;oul.</P>
<P N="1">1. I <HI>judge</HI> thus of my&s;elf. But I feel it not. Therefore there is in me &s;till, the old heart of &s;tone.</P>
<P N="2">2. I judge thus of happine&s;s. But I &s;till hanker after creature-happine&s;s. My &s;oul is almo&s;t continual|ly running out after one creature or another, and <HI>imagining</HI> how happy I &s;hould be in &s;uch or &s;uch a condition. I have more plea&s;ure in eating and drink|ing and in the company of tho&s;e I love, than I have in God. I have a reli&s;h for earthly happine&s;s. I have not a reli&s;h for Heavenly. <HI>I &s;avour (<GAP DESC="foreign">) the things of men, not the things of God.</HI> Therefore there is in me &s;till the carnal heart, the <GAP DESC="foreign">.</P>
<P>But the eyes of my under&s;tanding are not yet fully opened.</P>
<P N="2">II. "This is the de&s;ign of <HI>my</HI> live." But a thou|&s;and little de&s;igns are daily &s;tealing into my &s;oul. This is my <HI>ultimate</HI> de&s;ign; but <HI>intermediate</HI> de&s;igns are continually creeping in upon me; de&s;igns (tho' often di&s;gui&s;ed) of plea&s;ing my&s;elf, of doing my own will; de&s;igns, wherein I do not eye God, at lea&s;t, not him &s;ingly.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="029861_0221_0FE2AB29844F0700">
Therefore my eye is not yet &s;ingle; at lea&s;t, not always &s;o.</P>
<P N="3">III. Are my de&s;ires new? Not all. Some are new, &s;ome old. My de&s;ires are like my de&s;igns. My <HI>great</HI> de&s;ire is, To have <HI>Chri&s;t formed in my heart by faith.</HI> But little de&s;ires are daily &s;tealing into my &s;oul. And &s;o my great hopes and fears have re&s;pect to God. But a thou&s;and little ones creep in between them.</P>
<P>Again, my de&s;ires, pa&s;&s;ions and inclinations in general are mixed: having &s;omething of Chri&s;t and &s;omething of earth. I love you, for in&s;tance. But my love is only partly &s;piritual, and partly natural. Something of <HI>my own</HI> cleaves to that which is of God. Nor can I divide the earthly part from the heavenly.</P>
<P>Sund. 17. I preached in the afternoon at I&s;ling|ton: in the evening at St. Swithin's, for the la&s;t time. Sund. 24. I preached at Great St. Bar|tholomew's in the morning, and at I&s;lington in the afternoon; where we had the ble&s;&s;ed &s;acrament eve|ry day this week, and were comforted on every &s;ide.</P>
<P>Wed. 27. I preached at Ba&s;ing&s;haw church; Sund. 31, to many thou&s;ands, in St. George's, Spital-Fields. And to a yet more crouded congre|gation at Whitechapel, in the afternoon, I declared tho&s;e glad tidings (O that they would know the things which make for their peace!) <HI>I will heal their back&s;liding: I will love them freely.</HI></P>
<P>Monday, January 1, 1739. Me&s;&s;rs. Hall, Kinchin, Ingham, Whitefield, Hutchins, and my brother Charles, were pre&s;ent at our love-fea&s;t in Fetterlans, with about &s;ixty of our brethren. A <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> three in the morning, as we were continuing in&s;tant in prayer, the power of God come mightily upon us, in&s;omuch that many cried out for exceeding joy, and many
<PB N="225" REF="029861_0222_0FE2AB27EC38E470">fell to the ground. As &s;oon as we were recovered a little from that awe and amazement at the pre&s;ence of his Maje&s;ty, we broke out with one voice, <HI>We prai&s;e thee, O God: we acknowledge thee to be the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Thur&s;d. 4. One who had had the form of god|line&s;s many years, wrote the following reflections.</P>
<P>"My friends affirm <HI>I am mad,</HI> becau&s;e I &s;aid <HI>I was not a Chri&s;tian a year ago.</HI> I affirm, I am not a Chri&s;tian now. Indeed what I might have been I know not, had I been faithful to the grace then giv|en, when expecting nothing le&s;s, I received &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of the forgivene&s;s of my &s;ins, as till then I ne|ver knew. But that I am not a Chri&s;tian at this day, I as a&s;&s;uredly know, as that Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>"For a Chri&s;tian is one who has the fruits of the Spirit of Chri&s;t, which (to mention no more) are love, peace, joy. But the&s;e I have not. I have not any love of God. I do not love either the Father or the Son. Do you a&s;k, How do I know whether I love God? I an&s;wer by another que&s;tion, How do you know, whether you love me? Why, as you know, whether you are not or cold. You <HI>feel</HI> this moment, that you do or do not love me. And I <HI>feel</HI> this mo|ment, I do not love God; which therefore I <HI>know,</HI> becau&s;e I <HI>feel</HI> it. There is no word more proper, more dear, or more &s;trong.</P>
<P>"And I know it al&s;o by St. John's plain rule, <HI>If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</HI> For I love the world. I de&s;ire the things of the world, &s;ome or other of them, and have done all my life. I have always placed &s;ome part of my hap|pine&s;s in &s;ome or other of the things that are &s;een. Particularly in meat and drink, and in the company of tho&s;e I loved. For many years I have been, yea, and &s;till am hankering after a happine&s;s, in loving, and being loved by one or another. And in the&s;e
<PB N="226" REF="029861_0223_0FE2AB3283DF1AA8">I have from time to time taken more plea&s;ure th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> in God.</P>
<P>"Again, joy in the Holy Gho&s;t I have not. I have now and then &s;ome &s;tarts of joy in God: but it is not <HI>that</HI> joy. For it is not abiding. Neither is it greater than I have had on &s;ome worldly occa&s;i|ons. So that I can in no wi&s;e be &s;aid to <HI>rejoice ever|more;</HI> much le&s;s to <HI>rejoice with joy un&s;peakable and full of glory.</HI></P>
<P>"Yet again; I have not <HI>the peace of God; that</HI> peace, peculiarly &s;o called. The peace I have may be accounted for on natural principles. I have health, &s;trength, friends, a competent fortune, and a com|po&s;ed, cheerful temper. Who would not have a &s;ort of peace in &s;uch circum&s;tances? But I have none which can with any propriety be called, a peace which pa&s;&s;eth all under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>"From hence I conclude (and let all the <HI>&s;aints of the world</HI> hear, that wherein&s;oever they boa&s;t, they may be found even as I) though I have given, and do give all my goods to feed the poor, I am not a Chri&s;tian. Though I have endured hard&s;hip, though I have in all things denied my&s;elf and taken up my cro&s;s, I am not a Chri&s;tian. My works are nothing; my &s;ufferings are nothing; I have not the fruits of the Spirit of Chri&s;t. Though I have con&s;tantly u&s;ed all the means of grace, for twenty years, I am not a Chri&s;tian."</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day 17. I was with two per&s;ons, who I doubt are properly <HI>enthu&s;iae&s;ts.</HI> For, fir&s;t, they think to attain the end without the means, which is <HI>enthu&s;i|a&s;in,</HI> properly &s;o called. Again, they think them|&s;elves in&s;pired by God, and are not. But fal&s;e, ima|ginary in&s;piration is <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m.</HI> That theirs is only imaginary in&s;piration appears hence, it contradicts the law and the te&s;timony.</P>
<P>Sund. 21. We were &s;urprized in the evening, while I was expounding in the Minories. A well|dre&s;&s;ed,
<PB N="227" REF="029861_0224_0FE2AB35686F0748">middle-aged woman, &s;uddenly cried out, as in the agonies of death. She continued &s;o to for &s;ome time, with all the &s;igns of the &s;harpe&s;t angui&s;h of &s;pirit. When &s;he was a little recovered, I de&s;ired her to call upon me the next day. She then told me, that about three years before, &s;he was under &s;trong convictions of &s;in, and in &s;uch terror of mind, that he had no comfort in any thing, nor any re&s;t, day or night: that &s;he &s;ent for the mini&s;ter of her pari&s;h and told him the di&s;tre&s;s &s;he was in: upon which he told her hu&s;band &s;he was &s;tark mad, and advi&s;ed him to &s;end for a phy&s;ician immediately. A phy&s;ician was &s;ent for accordingly, who ordered her to be blooded, bli&s;tered, and &s;o on. But this did not heal her wound|ed &s;pirit. So that &s;he continued much as &s;he was be|fore: till the la&s;t night, he who&s;e word &s;he at fir&s;t found to be <HI>&s;harper than any two-edged &s;word,</HI> gave her a faint hope, that he would undertake her cau&s;e, and heal the &s;oul which had &s;inned again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Thur&s;. 25. I baptized John Smith (late an Ana|bapti&s;t) and four other adults at I&s;lington. Of the adults I have known baptized lately, one only was at that time born again, in the full &s;en&s;e of the word, that is, found a thorough, inward change, by the love of God filling her heart. Mo&s;t of them were only born again in a lower &s;en&s;e, <HI>i. e.</HI> received the remi&s;&s;i|on of their &s;ins. And &s;ome (as it has &s;ince too plain|ly appeared) neither in one &s;en&s;e nor the other.</P>
<P>Sund. 28. I went (having been long importuned thereto) about five in the evening, with four or five of my friends to a hou&s;e where was one of tho&s;e com|monly called French <HI>prophets.</HI> After a time, &s;he came in. She &s;eemed about four or five and twenty, of an agreeable &s;peech and behaviour. She a&s;ked, Why we came? I &s;aid, "To try the &s;pirits, whether they be of God." Pre&s;ently after &s;he leaned back in her chair, and &s;eemed to have &s;trong workings in her
<PB N="228" REF="029861_0225_0FE2AB36F9D7CCE0">brea&s;t, with deep &s;ighings intermixed. Her head and hands, and by turns, every part of her body &s;eem|ed al&s;o to be in a kind of convul&s;ive motion. This continued about ten minutes, till (at &s;ix) &s;he began to &s;peak (though the workings, &s;ighings, and contorti|ons of her body, were &s;o intermixed with her words, that &s;he &s;eldom &s;poke half a &s;entence together) with a clear, &s;trong voice, "Father, Thy will, thy will be done. Thus faith the Lord, if of any of you that is a father, his child a&s;k bread, will he give him a &s;tone? If he a&s;k a fi&s;h, will he give him a &s;corpion? A&s;k bread of me, my children, and I will give you bread. I will not, will not give you a &s;corpion. By this judge of what ye &s;hall now hear."</P>
<P>She &s;poke much (all as in the per&s;on of God, and mo&s;tly in &s;cripture words) of the fulfilling of the pro|phecies, the coming of Chri&s;t now at hand, and the &s;preading of the go&s;pel over all the earth. Then &s;he exhorted us, not to be in ha&s;te, in judging her &s;pirit, to be or not to be of God; but to wait upon God, and he would teach us, if we conferred not with fle&s;h and blood. She added, with many inforcements, "That we mu&s;t watch and pray, and take up our cro&s;s, and <HI>be &s;till before</HI> God."</P>
<P>Two or three of our company were much affected, and believed &s;he &s;poke by the Spirit of God. But this was in no wi&s;e clear to me. The motion might be either hy&s;terical or artificial. And the &s;ame words, any per&s;on of a good under&s;tanding and well ver&s;ed in the &s;criptures might have &s;poken. But I let the mat|ter alone: knowing this, that <HI>if it be not of God, it will come to nought.</HI></P>
<P>Sund. Feb. 4. I preached at St. Giles's on <HI>Who|&s;oever believeth on one, out of his belly &s;hall flow rivers of living water.</HI> How was the power of God pre&s;ent with us! I am content to preach her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> no more.</P>
<P>Frid. 9. A note was given me at Wapping, in (nearly) the&s;e words:

<P>YOUR <HI>prayers are de&s;ired for a child that is lunatic and &s;ore vexed day and night, that our Lord would be plea&s;ed to heal him, as he did tho&s;e in the days of his fe&s;t, and that he would give his parents faith and pati|ence till his time is come.</HI></P>
</LETTER></P>
<P>Tue&s;day 13. I received the following note.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I <HI>Return you hearty thanks for your prayers on</HI> Friday <HI>for my tor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ured &s;on.

<P><HI>Sir, he is taken with grievous weeping, his heart beat|ing, as if it would would beat there' his ribs, he &s;wells ready to bur&s;t, &s;weats great drops, runs about beating and tearing him&s;elf.

He is in his 11th year, a wonder of affliction: I hope, of mercy al&s;o; and that I &s;hall yet prai&s;e him who is my Redeemer and my</HI> God.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Sat. 17. A few of us prayed with him; and from that time (as his parents &s;ince informed us) he had more re&s;t (altho' not a full deliverance) than he had had for two years before.</P>
<P>Sund. 18. I was de&s;ired to preach at Sir George Wheeler's Chapel, in Spital-Fields, morning and af|ternoon. I did &s;o in the morning, but was not &s;uffer|ed to conclude my &s;ubject (as I had de&s;igned) in the afternoon; a good remembrance, that I &s;hould, if po&s;&s;ible, declare at <HI>every</HI> time, the <HI>whole</HI> coun&s;el of God.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="029861_0227_0FE2AB4383F0D9A0">
Sund. 25. I preached in the morning to a nume|rous congregation, at St. Katherine's, near the tow|er; at I&s;lington in the afternoon. Many here were (as u&s;ual) deeply offended. But the coun&s;el of the Lord it &s;hall &s;tand.</P>
<P>Frid. March 2. It was the advice of all our bre|thren, that I &s;hould &s;pend a few days at Oxford, whi|ther I accordingly went on Saturd. 3. A few names I found here al&s;o, who had not denied the faith, nei|ther been a&s;hamed of their Lord, even in the mid&s;t of a perver&s;e generation. And every day we were toge|ther, we had convincing proof, &s;uch as it had not before entered into our hearts to conceive, that <HI>he is able to &s;ave unto the uttermo&s;t all that come unto God thro' him.</HI></P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing in&s;tances of his power which I ever remember to have &s;een, was on the Tue&s;|day following; when I vi&s;ited one who was above mea&s;ure enraged at <HI>this new way,</HI> and zealous in op|po&s;ing it. Finding argument to be of no other effect, than to inflame her more and more, I broke off the di&s;pute and de&s;ired we might join in prayer, which &s;he &s;o far con&s;ented to, as to kneel down. In a few minutes &s;he fell into an extreme agony, both of bo|dy and &s;oul; and &s;oon after cried out with the utmo&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s. "Now I know, I am forgiven for Chri&s;t's fake." Many other words &s;he uttered to the &s;ame effect, witne&s;&s;ing a hope full of immortality. And from that hour, God hath &s;et her face as a flint to declare the faith which before &s;he per&s;ecuted.</P>
<P>Thur&s;. 8. I called upon her and a few of her neighbours, who were met together in the evening, among whom I found a gentleman of the &s;ame &s;pi|rit &s;he had been of, earne&s;tly labouring to pervert the truth of the go&s;pel. To prevent his going on, as the le&s;s evil of the two, I entered directly into the controver&s;y, touching both the cau&s;e and the fruits
<PB N="231" REF="029861_0228_0FE2AB4654E960D8">of ju&s;tification: In the mid&s;t of the di&s;pute, one who &s;at at a &s;mall di&s;tance, felt as it were the piercing of a &s;word, and before &s;he could be brought to another hou&s;e, whither I was going, could not avoid crying out aloud, even in the &s;treet. But no &s;ooner had we made our reque&s;t known to God, than he &s;ent her help from his holy place.</P>
<P>At my return from hence, I found Mr. Kinchin, ju&s;t come from Dummer, who earne&s;tly de&s;ired me, in&s;tead of &s;etting out for London the next morning (as I de&s;igned) to go to Dummer and &s;upply his church on Sunday. On Friday morning I &s;et out, according to his de&s;ire, and in the evening came to Reading, where I found a young
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Cennick</NOTE> man who had in &s;ome mea&s;ure <HI>known the power of the world to come.</HI> I &s;pent the evening with him and a few of his &s;erious friends; and it plea&s;ed God much to &s;trengthen and comfort them.</P>
<P>Sat. 10. In the afternoon I came to Dummer; and on Sunday morning had a large and attentive congregation. I was de&s;ired to expound in the even|ing at Ba&s;ing&s;toke. The next day I returned to Reading, and thence on Tue&s;day to Oxford, where I found many more and more rejoicing in God their Saviour. Wedne&s;day 14, I had an opportunity of preaching once again to the poor pri&s;oners in the Ca&s;tle. Thur&s;d. 15. I &s;et out early in the morning, and in the afternoon came to London.</P>
<P>During my &s;tay here, I was fully employed; be|tween our own &s;ociety, in Fetter-lane, and many others, where I was continually de&s;ired to expound: &s;o that I had no thought of leaving London, when I received (after &s;everal others) a letter from Mr. Whitefield, and another from Mr. Seward, entreating me in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing manner, to come to Bri&s;tol without delay. This I was not at all forward to do;

<P>Wed. 28. My journey was propo&s;ed to our &s;ociety in Fetter-lane. But my brother Charles would &s;carce bear the mention of it; till appealing to the oracles of God, he received tho&s;e words, as &s;poken to him|&s;elf, and an&s;wered not again: <HI>Son of man, behold I take from thee the de&s;ire of thine eyes with a &s;troke: Yet &s;halt thou not mourn or weep, neither &s;hall thy tears run down.</HI> Our other brethren however continuing the di&s;pute, without any probability of their coming to one conclu&s;ion, we at length all agreed, to decide it by lot.

<P>Perhaps it may be a &s;atisfaction to &s;ome, if before I enter upon this new period of my life, I give the rea&s;ons, why I preferred for &s;o many years an univer|&s;ity life before any other: then e&s;pecially, when I was earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed by my father, to accept of a cure of &s;ouls. I have here therefore &s;ubjoined the letter I wrote &s;everal years ago on that occa&s;ion:
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE>
<DATELINE>Oxford, <DATE>Dec. 10, 1734.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P N="1">1. THE authority of a parent and the call of providence are things of &s;o &s;acred a nature, that a que&s;tion in which the&s;e are any way concerned, de&s;erves the mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ideration. I am there|fore greatly obliged to you, for the pains you have taken to &s;et our que&s;tion in a clear light; which I now intend to con&s;ider more at large with the utmo&s;t attention of which I am capable. And I &s;hall the more cheerfully do it, as being a&s;&s;ured of your joining with me in imploring his guidance, who will not &s;uffer tho&s;e that tru&s;t in him, to &s;eek death in the error of their life.</P>
<P N="2">2. I entirely agree, "That the glory of God and the different degrees of promoting it, are to be our &s;ole con&s;ideration and direction in the choice of any cour&s;e of life:" and con&s;equently, that it mu&s;t wholly turn upon this &s;ingle point, which I ought to prefer, a college life, or that of rector of a pari&s;h? I do not &s;ay, the glory of God is to be my fir&s;t or my prin|cipal con&s;ideration: but my <HI>only</HI> one; &s;ince all that are not implied in this, are ab&s;olutely of no weight. In pre&s;ence of this, they all vani&s;h away: they are le&s;s than the &s;mall du&s;t of the balance.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="234" REF="029861_0231_0FE2AB512AEEF398">
3. And indeed, till all other con&s;iderations were &s;et a&s;ide, I could never come to any clear determina|tion: till my eye was &s;ingle, my whole mind was full of darkne&s;s. Whereas &s;o long as it was fixed on the glory of God, without any other con&s;ideration, I have no more doubt of the way wherein I &s;hould go, than of the &s;hining of the mid-day &s;un.</P>
<P N="4">4. Now that life tends mo&s;t to the glory of God, wherein we mo&s;t promote holine&s;s in our&s;elves and others; I &s;ay, of our&s;elves and others, as being fully per&s;uaded, that the&s;e can never be put a&s;under. And if not, then whatever &s;tate is be&s;t on either of the&s;e accounts, is &s;o on the other likewi&s;e. If it be on the whole be&s;t for others, &s;o it is for our&s;elves: if it be be&s;t for our&s;elves, it is &s;o for them.</P>
<P N="5">5. However, when two ways of life are propo&s;ed, I would choo&s;e to con&s;ider fir&s;t, which have I rea&s;on to believe, will be be&s;t for <HI>my own &s;oul?</HI> Will mo&s;t forward me in holine&s;s? By holine&s;s meaning, not fa&s;ting (as you &s;eem to &s;uppo&s;e) or bodily au&s;terities; but the mind that was in Chri&s;t. A renewal of &s;oul in the image of God. And I believe the &s;tate where|in I am, will mo&s;t forward me in this, becau&s;e of the peculiar advantages I now enjoy.</P>
<P N="6">6. The fir&s;t of the&s;e is daily conver&s;e with my friends. I know no other place under heaven, where I can have &s;ome always at hand, of the &s;ame judg|ment, and engaged in the &s;ame &s;tudies; per&s;ons who are awakened into a full conviction, that they have but one work to do upon earth; who &s;ee at a di&s;tance, what that one work is, even the recovery of a &s;ingle eye and a clean heart; who in order to this, have ac|cording to their power, ab&s;olutely devoted them&s;elves to God, and follow after their Lord, denying them|&s;elves and taking up their cro&s;s daily. To have even a &s;mall number of &s;uch friends, con&s;tantly watching over my &s;oul, and admini&s;tering, as need it, reproof
<PB N="235" REF="029861_0232_0FE2AB53E0005260">or advice with all plainne&s;s and gentlene&s;s, is a ble&s;|&s;ing I know not where to find, in any other part of the kingdom.</P>
<P N="7">7. Another ble&s;&s;ing which I enjoy here in a great|er degree than I could expect el&s;ewhere, is retirement. I have not only as much, but as little company as I plea&s;e. Trifling vi&s;itants I have none. No one takes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> into his head, to come within my doors, unle&s;s I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> him, or he has bu&s;ine&s;s with me. And even then, as &s;oon as his bu&s;ine&s;s is done, he immediately goes away.</P>
<P N="8">8. Both the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings are greatly endeared to me when I &s;pend but one week out of this place. The far greate&s;t part of the conver&s;ation I meet with abroad, even with the better &s;ort of men, turns on points that are quite wide of <HI>my</HI> purpo&s;e, that no way forward the end of <HI>my</HI> life. Now, if they have time to &s;pare, I have not. It is ab&s;olutely needful for &s;uch a one as me, to follow with all po&s;&s;ible care and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">igilance that wi&s;e advice of Mr. Herbert;
<Q><L>"Still let thy mind be bent; &s;till plotting how,</L>
<L>"And when, and where, the bu&s;ine&s;s may be done."</L></Q></P>
<P>And this, I ble&s;s God, I can in &s;ome mea&s;ure do, while I avoid that bane of all religion, the compa|ny of <HI>good &s;ort of men,</HI> as they are called; per&s;ons who have a <HI>liking</HI> to, but no <HI>&s;en&s;e</HI> of religion. But the&s;e in&s;en&s;ibly undermine all my re&s;olution, and &s;teal away what little zeal I have. So that I never come from among the&s;e faints of the world (as John Val|de&s;&s;o terms them) faint, di&s;&s;ipated and &s;horn of all my &s;trength, but I &s;ay, "God deliver me from a half Chri&s;tian."</P>
<P N="9">9. Freedom from care is yet another invaluable ble&s;&s;ing. And where could I enjoy this as I do now; I <HI>hear</HI> of &s;uch a thing as the cares of the
<PB N="236" REF="029861_0233_0FE2AB55779BA438"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">; but I <HI>feel</HI> them not. My income is ready for me on &s;o many &s;tated days: all I have to do in, to carry it home. The grand article of my expen&s;e in food. And this too is provided without any care of mine. The &s;ervants I employ are always ready as quarter-day; &s;o I have no trouble on their account, And what I occa&s;ionally need to buy, I can immediate|ly have, without any expen&s;e of thought. Here there|fore I can be <HI>without carefulne&s;s.</HI> I can <HI>attend upon the Lord without di&s;traction.</HI> And I know what a help this is to the being <HI>holy both in body and &s;pirit.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. To quicken me in making a diligent and thank|ful u&s;e of the&s;e peculiar advantages, I have the op|portunity of communicating weekly, and of public prayer twice a day. It would be ea&s;y to mention many more, as well as to &s;hew many di&s;advantages, which one of greater courage and &s;kill than me, could &s;carce &s;eparate from the way of life you &s;peak of. But whatever others could do, I could not. I could not &s;tand my ground one month, again&s;t in|temperance in &s;leep, &s;elf-indulgence in food, irregu|larity in &s;tudy: again&s;t a general lukewarmne&s;s in my affections, and remi&s;&s;ne&s;s in my actions, again&s;t a &s;oft|ne&s;s directly oppo&s;ite to the character of a good &s;oldi|er of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And then when my &s;pirit was thus di&s;&s;olved, I &s;hould be an ea&s;y prey to every temptation. Then might the cares of the world and the de&s;ire of other things, roll back with a full tide upon me: and it would be no wonder, if while I preached to others, I my&s;elf &s;hould be a ca&s;t-away. I cannot therefore but ob&s;erve, that the que&s;tion does not relate barely to the <HI>degrees</HI> of holine&s;s, but to the very <HI>being of it:</HI>
<Q>Agitur de Vita &amp; Sanguine Turni:</Q></P>

I own al&s;o, "That every follower of Chri&s;t, is, in his proportion, the light of the world.: that who&s;oever is &s;uch, can no more be con|cealed, than the fun in the mid&s;t of heaven; that if he is &s;et as a light in a dark place, his &s;hining mu&s;t be the more con&s;picuous; that to this very end was his light given, even to &s;hine on all around him:" and indeed, That "there is only one way to hide it, which is, to put it out."

<P N="13">13.

So many living witne&s;&s;es hath God given, that <HI>his hand is</HI> &s;till <HI>&s;tretched out to heal,</HI> and that <HI>&s;igns and wonders are even now wrought, by his holy child Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>Wedne&s;. 18. In the evening L&mdash;a S&mdash; (late a quaker, but baptized the day before) R&mdash;a M&mdash; and a few others, were admitted into the &s;o|ciety. But R&mdash;a M&mdash; was &s;carcely able, either to &s;peak or look up. <HI>The &s;orrows of death compa&s;&s;ed her about, the pains of hell got hold upon her.</HI> We pour|ed out our complaints before God, and &s;hewed him of her trouble. And he &s;oon &s;hewed, he is a God <HI>that heureth prayer,</HI> &s;he felt in her&s;elf, that <HI>being ju&s;tified
<PB N="247" REF="029861_0244_0FE2AB851AA97850">freely, &s;he had peace with God, thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> She <HI>rejoiced in hope of the glory of God, and the love of God was &s;hed abroad in her heart.</HI></P>
<P>April 20. Being Good-Friday, E&mdash;th R&mdash;n, T&mdash;l W&mdash;s, and one or two others fir&s;t knew they had <HI>redemption in the blood of Chri&s;t, the remi&s;&s;ion of</HI> their <HI>&s;ins.</HI></P>
<P>Sat. 21. At Weaver's-hall a young man was &s;ud|denly &s;eized with a violent trembling all over, and in a few minutes, <HI>the &s;orrows of his heart being enlarged,</HI> &s;unk down to the ground. But we cea&s;ed not calling upon God, till he rai&s;ed him up full of <HI>peace and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>On Ea&s;ter-Day, it being a thorough rain, I could only preach at Newgate at eight in the morning, and two in the afternoon; in a hou&s;e near Hannam-Mount at eleven: and in one near Ro&s;e-green at five. At the &s;ociety in the evening, many were cut to the heart, and many comforted.</P>
<P>Mond. 23. On a repeated invitation I went to Pensford, about five miles from Bri&s;tol. I &s;ent to the mini&s;ter, to a&s;k leave to preach in the church, but having waited &s;ome time and received no an&s;wer, I called on many of the people who were gathered to|gether in an open place, <HI>If any man thir&s;t, let him come unto me and drink.</HI> At four in the afternoon there were above three thou&s;and, in a convenient place near Bri&s;tol, to whom I declared, <HI>The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead &s;hall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear &s;hall live.</HI></P>
<P>I preached at Bath to about a thou&s;and on Tue&s;day morning, and at four in the afternoon to the poor colliers, at a place about the middle of King&s;wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, called Two-Mile-hill. In the evening at Baldwin|&s;treet, a young man, after a &s;harp (though &s;hort) agony, both of body and mind, found his &s;oul filled with peace, <HI>knowing in whom he had believed.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="029861_0245_0FE2AB86ADEB95B0">
Wed. 24. To above two th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;and at Bapti&s;t-mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, I explained that glorious &s;cripture (de&s;eribed in the &s;tate of every true believer in Chri&s;t, every one who by faith is born of God) <HI>Ye have not received the &s;pirit of bondage again unto fear, but ye have received the &s;pirit of adoption, whereby we cry Abba, Father.</HI></P>
<P>Thur&s;d. 25. While I was preaching at Newgate on the&s;e words, <HI>He that believeth hath everla&s;ting life;</HI> I was in&s;en&s;ibly led, without any previous de&s;ign, to declare &s;trongly and explicitly, That <HI>God willeth all men to be thus &s;aved;</HI> and to pray that, <Q>If this were not the truth of God, he would not &s;uffer the blind to go out of the way; but if it were, he would bear witne&s;s to his word.</Q> Immediately one, and mother, and another &s;unk to the earth: they dropped on every &s;ide as thunder&s;truck. One of them cried aloud. We be&s;ought God in her behalf, and he turn|ed her heavine&s;s into joy. A &s;econd being in the &s;ame agony, we called upon God for her al&s;o; and he &s;poke peace unto her &s;oul. In the evening I was again pre&s;&s;ed in &s;pirit to declare, that <HI>Chri&s;t gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all.</HI> And almo&s;t before we called upon him, to &s;et to his &s;eal, be an&s;wered. One was &s;o wound|ed by the &s;word of the &s;pirit, that you would have imagined &s;he could not live a moment. But imme|diately his abundant kindne&s;s was &s;hewed, and &s;he loud|ly &s;ang of his righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> 26. All Newgate rang with the cries of tho&s;e whom the word of God cut to the heart. Two of whom were in a moment filled with joy, to the a&s;toni&s;h|ment of tho&s;e that beheld them.</P>
<P>Sund. 28. I declared the free grace of God to about four thou&s;and people, from tho&s;e words, <HI>He that &s;pared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how &s;hall be not with him al&s;o freely give us all things?</HI> At that hour it was, that one who had long continued in fin, from a de&s;pair of finding mercy, re|ceived
<PB N="249" REF="029861_0246_0FE2AB885F7C8430">a full, clear &s;en&s;e of his pardoning love, and power to &s;in no more. I then went to Clifton (a mile from Bri&s;tol) at the mini&s;ter's de&s;ire, who was dangerou&s;ly ill, and thence returned to a little plain, near Hannam-mount, where about three thou&s;and were pre&s;ent. After dinner I went to Clifton again. The church was quite full at the prayers and &s;ermon, as was the church-yard at the burial which followed. From Clifton we went to Ro&s;e-green, where were (by computation) near &s;even thou&s;and, and thence to Glouce&s;ter-lane Society. After which was our fir&s;t Love-fea&s;t in Baldwin-&s;treet. O how has God renew|ed my &s;trength! Who u&s;ed ten years ago to be &s;o faint and weary, with preaching <HI>twice</HI> in one day!</P>
<P>Mond. 29. We under&s;tood that many were offend|ed at the cries of tho&s;e on whom the power of God came: among whom was a phy&s;ician, who was much afraid there might be fraud or impo&s;ture in the ca&s;e. To-day one whom he had known many years, was the fir&s;t (while I was preaching at Newgate) who broke out into <HI>&s;trong cries and &s;ears.</HI> He could hard|ly believe his own eyes and ears. He went and &s;tood clo&s;e to her, and ob&s;erved every &s;ymptom, till great drops of &s;weat ran down her face, and all her bones &s;hook. He then knew not what to think, being clear|ly convinced, it was not fraud, nor yet any natural di&s;order. But when both her &s;oul and body were healed in a moment, he acknowledged the finger of God.</P>
<P>Tue&s;. May 1. Many were offended again, and in|deed, much more than before. For at Baldwin-&s;treet my voice could &s;carce be heard amid&s;t the groanings of &s;ome, and the cries of others calling aloud to <HI>him that is mighty to &s;ave.</HI> I de&s;ired all that were &s;incere of heart, to be&s;eech with me <HI>the Prince exalted for us,</HI> that he would <HI>proclaim deliverance to the captives.</HI> And he &s;oon &s;hewed that he heard our voice. Many of
<PB N="250" REF="029861_0247_0FE2AB931C8617F0">tho&s;e who had been long in darkne&s;s, &s;aw the dawn of a great light: and ten per&s;ons (I afterwards &s;ound) then began to &s;ay in &s;aith, <HI>my</HI> Lord <HI>and my</HI> God!</P>
<P>A Quaker who &s;tood by, was not a little di&s;plea&s;|ed at <HI>the di&s;&s;imulation of tho&s;e creatures,</HI> and was biting his lips and knitting his brows, when he dropped down as thunder-&s;truck. The agony he was in, was even terrible to behold. We be&s;ought-God, not to lay folly to his charge. And he &s;oon lifted up his voice and cried aloud, "now I know, Thou art a prophet of the Lord."</P>
<P>Wed. 2. At Newgate, another mourner was com|&s;orted. I was de&s;ired to &s;tep thence to a neighbouring hou&s;e to &s;ee a letter wrote again&s;t me, as <HI>a deceiver of the people,</HI> by teaching that God <HI>willeth</HI> all men <HI>to be &s;aved.</HI> One who long had a&s;&s;erted the contrary was there, when a young woman came in (who could &s;ay before, "I know that <HI>my</HI> Redeemer liveth") all in tears and in deep angui&s;h of &s;pirit. She &s;aid, "She had been rea&s;oning with her&s;elf, how the&s;e things could be, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ll &s;he was perplexed more and more, and &s;he now found the Spirit of God was departed from her." We began to pray, and &s;he cried out, "He is come! He is come! I again rejoice in God <HI>my</HI> Saviour." Ju&s;t as we ro&s;e from giving thanks, ano|ther per&s;on reeled four or five &s;teps, and then dropped down. We prayed with her, and left her &s;trongly convinced of &s;in, and earne&s;tly groaning for de|liverance.</P>
<P>I did not mention one J&mdash;n H&mdash;n, a weaver, who was at Baldwin-&s;treet the night before. He was (I under&s;tood) a man of a regular life and conver&s;a|tion, one that con&s;tantly attended the public prayers and &s;acrament, and was zealous for the church, and again&s;t di&s;&s;enters of every denomination. Being in|formed that <HI>people fell into &s;trange fits at the &s;ocieties,</HI> he came to &s;ee and judge for him&s;elf. But he was
<PB N="251" REF="029861_0248_0FE2AB95119F7D68">le&s;s &s;atisfied than before; in&s;omuch that he went about to his acquaintance one after another, till one in the morning, and laboured above mea&s;ure to convince them "It was a delu&s;ion of the devil." We were going home, when one met us in the &s;treet and in|formed us, "That J&mdash;n H&mdash; was fallen raving mad." It &s;eems he had &s;at down to dinner, but had a mind fir&s;t to end a &s;ermon he had borrowed on <Q>Salvation by &s;aith.</Q> In reading the la&s;t page, he changed colour, fell off his chair, and began &s;creaming ter|ribly and beating him&s;elf again&s;t the ground. The neighbours were alarmed and flocked together to the hou&s;e. Between one and two I came in, and found him on the floor, the room being full of people, whom his wi&s;e would have kept without; but he cried aloud, "No; let them all come, let all the world &s;ee the ju&s;t judgment of God." Two or three men were holding him as well as they could. He immediately fixed his eyes upon <HI>me,</HI> and &s;tretching out his hand, cried, <Q>Ay, this is he, who I &s;aid was a deceiver of the people. But God has over|taken me. I &s;aid, it was all a delu&s;ion. But this is no delu&s;ion.</Q> He then roared out, "O thou devil! Thou cur&s;ed devil! Yea, thou legion of devils! Thou can&s;t not &s;tay. Chri&s;t will ca&s;t thee out. I know his work is begun. Tear me to pieces, if thou wilt: but thou can&s;t not hurt me." He then beat him&s;elf again&s;t the ground again; his brea&s;t heaving at the &s;ame time, as in the pangs of death, and great drops of &s;weat trickling down his face. We all be|took our&s;elves to prayer. His pangs cea&s;ed, and both his body and &s;oul were &s;et at liberty.</P>
<P>Thence I went to Bapti&s;t-mills, -and declared him whom God <HI>hath exalted to be a prince and a Saviour, to give repentance unto I&s;rael and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins.</HI> Re|turning to J&mdash;n H&mdash;, we found his voice was lo&s;t, and his body weak as that of an infant. But
<PB N="252" REF="029861_0249_0FE2AB96A0DA9560">his &s;oul was in peace, full of love, and <HI>rejoicing in hope of the glory of God.</HI></P>
<P>The women of our &s;ociety met at &s;even. During our prayer, one of them fell into a violent agony: but &s;oon after began to cry out with confidence, My Lord and <HI>my</HI> God! Sat. 5. I preached at the de&s;ire of an unknown corre&s;pondent, on tho&s;e excellent words (if well under&s;tood as recommending faith, re&s;ignation, patience, meekne&s;s) <HI>Be &s;till, and know that I am God.</HI></P>
<P>Sund. 6. I preached in the morning, to 5 or 6000 people, on, <HI>Except ye be converted and become as little children, ye cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven.</HI> (The &s;ame words on which I preached the next day, and on Wed. at Bapti&s;t-mills.) On Hannam-mount I preached to about three thou&s;and, on The <HI>&s;cripture hath concluded all under &s;in:</HI> at two at Clifton church, on Chri&s;t our <HI>wi&s;dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;anctification, and redemption; and</HI> about five, at Ro&s;e-green, on the <HI>promi&s;e by faith of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which is given to them that believe.</HI></P>
<P>Mond. 7. I was preparing to &s;et out for Pensford, having now had leave to preach in the church, when I received the following note:</P>
<P>Sir, <HI>Our mini&s;ter, having been informed, you are be&s;ide your&s;elf, does not care you &s;hould preach in any of his churches.</HI>&mdash;I went however, and on Prie&s;t-Down, about half a mile from Pensford, preached Chri&s;t our <HI>wi&s;dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;anctification and redemption.</HI></P>
<P>Tue&s;. 8. I went to Bath, but was not &s;uffered to be in the meadow where I was before: which occa&s;ioned the offer of a much more convenient place; where I preached Chri&s;t to about a thou&s;and &s;ouls.</P>
<P>Wed. 9. We took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a piece of ground, near St. James's church-yard, in the Hor&s;e Fair, where it was de&s;igned to build a room, large enough to con|tain both the &s;ocieties of Nicholas and Baldwin-&s;treet, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;uch of their acquaintance as might de&s;ire to be
<PB N="253" REF="029861_0250_0FE2AB9830E46B20">pre&s;ent with them, at &s;uch time as the &s;cripture was expounded. And on Sat. 12. the fir&s;t &s;tone was laid, with the voice of prai&s;e and thank&s;giving.</P>
<P>I had not at fir&s;t the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ion or de&s;ign, of being per&s;onally engaged, either in the expen&s;e of this work, or in the direction of it: having ap|pointed eleven feoffees, on whom I &s;uppo&s;ed the&s;e burthens would fall of cour&s;e. But I quickly found my mi&s;take; fir&s;t with regard to the expen&s;e: for the whole undertaking mu&s;t have &s;tood &s;till, had not I immediately taken upon my&s;elf the payment of all the workmen; &s;o that before I knew where I was, I had con|tracted a debt of more than an hundred and fifty pounds. And this I was to di&s;charge how I could; the &s;ub&s;criptions of both &s;ocieties not amounting to one quarter of the &s;um. And as to the direction of the work, I pre&s;ently received letters from my friends in London, Mr. Whitefield in particular, backed with a me&s;&s;age by one ju&s;t come from thence, that neither he nor they would have any thing to do with the building, neither contribute any thing towards it, unle&s;s I would in&s;tantly di&s;charge all feoffees, and do every thing in my own name. Many rea&s;ons they gave for this; but one was enough, viz. "That &s;uch feoffees always would have it in their power, to con|troul me, and if I preached not as they liked, to turn me out of the room I had built." I according|ly yielded to their advice, and calling all the feoffees together, cancelled (no man oppo&s;ing) the in&s;trument made before, and took the whole management into my own hands. Money, it is true, I had not, nor any human pro&s;pect or probability of procuring it. But I knew <HI>the earth is the Lord's, and the fulne&s;s there|of,</HI> and in his name &s;et out, nothing doubting.</P>
<P>In the evening, while I was declaring, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t had <HI>given him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all,</HI> three per&s;ons almo&s;t at once, &s;unk down as dead, having all their
<PB N="254" REF="029861_0251_0FE2ABA15978B8B0">&s;ins &s;et in array before them. But in a &s;hort- time they were rai&s;ed up, and knew that <HI>the Lamb of God who taketh away the &s;in of the world,</HI> had taken away their &s;ins.</P>
<P>Sund. 13. I began expounding in the morning, the xiiith chapter of the fir&s;t epi&s;tle to the Corinthi|ans. At Hannam I farther explained, the promi&s;e given by faith; as I did al&s;o at Ro&s;e-green. At Clifton it plea&s;ed God to a&s;&s;i&s;t me greatly, in &s;peak|ing on tho&s;e words, <HI>He that drinketh of this water &s;hall thir&s;t again; but who&s;o drinketh of the water that I &s;hall give him &s;hall never thir&s;t: but the water which I &s;hall give him &s;hall be in him a well of water, &s;pringing up in|to everla&s;ting life.</HI></P>
<P>My ordinary employment (in public) was now as follows: Every morning I read prayers and preached at Newgate. Every evening I expounded a portion of &s;cripture, at one, or more of the &s;ocieties. On Monday in the afternoon I preached abroad near Bri&s;|tol; on Tue&s;day at Bath and Two-Mile-hill alternate|ly. On Wedne&s;day at Bapti&s;t-mills. Every other Thur&s;day near Pensford. Every other Friday in an|other part of King&s;wood. On Saturday in the after|noon and Sunday morning, in the Bowling-green (which lies near the middle of the city.) On Sunday at eleven near Hannam-mount. At two at Clifton, and at five on Ro&s;e-green. And hitherto <HI>as my day is, &s;o my &s;trength hath been.</HI></P>
<P>Tue&s;. 15. As I was expounding in the Back-lane, on the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, many who had before been righteous in their own eyes, abhorred them&s;elves as in du&s;t and a&s;hes. But two, who &s;eemed to be more deeply convinced than the re&s;t, did not long &s;orrow as men without hope; but found in that hour, that they had <HI>an advocate with the Father, Je&s;us Chri&s;t the righteous:</HI> as did three others in Glonce&s;ter-lane the evening before, and
<PB N="255" REF="029861_0252_0FE2ABA36CACD420">three at Baldwin-&s;treet this evening. About ten, two who after &s;eeing a great light, had again rea&s;oned them&s;elves into darkne&s;s, came to us, heavy laden. We cried to God, and they were again <HI>filied with peace and joy in believing.</HI></P>
<P>Wedne&s;. 16. While I was declaring at Bapti&s;t-mills, <HI>He was wounded for our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions,</HI> a middle-aged man began violently beating his brea&s;t, and crying to him <HI>by who&s;e &s;tripes we are healed.</HI> During our pray|er, God put a new &s;ong in his mouth. Some mock|ed and others owned the hand of God. Particularly a woman of Bapti&s;t-mills, who was now convinced of her own want of an advocate with God, and went home full of angui&s;h, but was in a few hours filled with joy, knowing he had <HI>blotted out all her tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;cripture which came in turn at Newgate to|day, was the viith of St. John. The words which I chiefly in&s;i&s;ted on as applicable to every mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, who in any wi&s;e follows the &s;teps of his Ma&s;ter, were the&s;e, <HI>The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, becau&s;e I te&s;tify of it, that its deeds are evil. There was a murmuring therefore concerning him among the multitude; for &s;ome &s;aid, He is a good man: others &s;aid, Nay, but he deceiveth the people.</HI> After &s;ermon I was inform|ed the &s;heriffs had ordered, "I &s;hould preach he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for the future, <HI>but once a week.</HI>" Yea, and this is <HI>once too often,</HI> if <HI>he deceiveth the people:</HI> but if other|wi&s;e, why not once a day?</P>
<P>Satur. 19. At Weaver's-hall, a woman fir&s;t, and then a boy (about fourteen years of age) was overwhelm|ed with &s;in, and &s;orrow, and fear. But we cried to God, and their &s;ouls were delivered.</P>
<P>Sund. 20. Seeing many of the rich at Clifton church, my heart was much pained for them, and I was earne&s;tly de&s;irous that &s;ome even of them might <HI>enter into the kingdom of heaven.</HI> But full as I was, I
<PB N="256" REF="029861_0253_0FE2ABA5802F68B8">knew not where to begin, in warning them to flee from the wrath to come, till my te&s;tament opened on tho&s;e words, <HI>I came not to call the righteous, but &s;inners to repentance:</HI> in applying which, my &s;oul was &s;o en|larged, that methought I could have cried out (in ano|ther &s;en&s;e than poor, vain Archimedes) "Give me where to &s;tand, and I will &s;hake the earth." God's &s;ending forth lightning with the rain, did not hinder about fifteen hundred from &s;taying at Ro&s;e-green. Our &s;cripture was, <HI>It is the glorious God that muketh the thunder. The voice of the Lord is mighty in operation, the voice of the Lord is a glorious voice.</HI> In the even|ing, he &s;poke to three who&s;e &s;ouls were all &s;torm and tempe&s;t, and immediately there was a great calm.</P>
<P>During this whole time, I was almo&s;t continually a&s;ked, either by tho&s;e who purpo&s;ely came to Bri&s;tol, to enquire concerning this &s;trange work, or by my old or new corre&s;pondents, <HI>How can the&s;e things be?</HI> And innumerable cautions were given me (generally grounded on gro&s;s mi&s;repre&s;entations of things) "Not to regard vi&s;ions or dreams; or to fancy people had remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, becau&s;e of their cries, or tears, or bare outward profe&s;&s;ions." To one who had many times wrote to me on this head, the &s;um of my an|&s;wer was as follows:</P>
<P>"The que&s;tion between us turns chiefly, if not whol|ly, on matter of fact. You deny, that God does <HI>now</HI> work <HI>the&s;e</HI> effects: at lea&s;t, that he works them in <HI>this</HI> manner. I affirm both; becau&s;e I have heard the&s;e things with my own ears, and have &s;een them with my eyes. I have &s;een (as far as a thing of this kind can be &s;een) very many per&s;ons changed in a moment, from the &s;pirit of fear, horror, de&s;pair, to the &s;pirit of love, joy and peace; and from &s;inful de&s;ire till then reign|ing over them, to a pure de&s;ire of doing the will of God. The&s;e are matters of fact, whereof I have been, and almo&s;t daily am, an eye or ear-witne&s;s,
<PB N="257" REF="029861_0254_0FE2ABA70FED1A48">What I have to &s;ay touching vi&s;ions or dreams is this: I know &s;everal per&s;ons in whom this great change was wrought, in a dream, or during a &s;trong repre&s;enta|tion to the eye of their mind, of Chri&s;t either on the cro&s;s or in glory. This is the fact; let any judge of it as they plea&s;e.

<P>"Perhaps it might be, becau&s;e of the hardne&s;s of our hearts, unready to receive any thing, unle&s;s we &s;ee it with our eyes, and hear it with our ears, that God in tender conde&s;cen&s;ion to our weakne&s;s, &s;uffered &s;o many outward &s;igns of the very time when he wrought this inward change, to be continually &s;een and heard among us.

<P>In the evening, I was interrupted at Nicholas-&s;treet, almo&s;t as &s;oon as I had begun to &s;peak, by the cries of one who was <HI>pricked at the heart,</HI> and &s;trongly groaned for pardon and peace.

By this re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ort I al&s;o gained a much larger audience, among whom were many of the rich and great.

<P>You &s;ay, "You cannot reconcile &s;ome parts of my behaviour with the character I have long &s;upported." No, nor ever will. Therefore I have di&s;claimed that character on every po&s;&s;ible occa&s;ion.

When they urged my works and &s;elf-denial, I an&s;wer|ed &s;hort, <HI>Though I give all my goods to feed the poor, and my body to be burned, I am nothing.</HI> For I have not charity. I do not love God with all my heart. If they added, <Q>Nay, but you could not preach as you do, if you was not a Chri&s;tian;</Q> I again confront|ed them with St. Paul, <HI>Though I &s;peak with the tongue of men and angels, and have not charity, I am nothing.</HI> Mo&s;t earne&s;tly therefore, both in public and private did

<P>If you a&s;k, "On what principle then I acted?"

<P>As to your advice, "That I &s;hould &s;ettle in college," I have no bu&s;ine&s;s there, having now no office, and no pupils. And whether the other branch of your pro|po&s;al be expedient for me, viz. "To accept of a cure of &s;ouls," it will be time enough to con&s;ider, when one is offered to me.</P>

<P>Wed. 13. In the morning I came to London, and after receiving the holy communion at I&s;lington, I had once more an opportunity of &s;eeing my mother, whom I had not &s;een &s;ince my return from Germany.</P>
<P>I cannot but mention an odd circum&s;tance here. I had read her a paper in June la&s;t year, containing a &s;hort account of what had pa&s;&s;ed in my own &s;oul, till within a few days of that time. She greatly approved it and &s;aid "She heartily ble&s;&s;ed God, who had brought me to &s;o ju&s;t a way of thinking." While I was in Germany, a copy of that paper was &s;ent (without my knowledge) to one of my relations. He &s;ent an account of it to my mother; whom I now found under &s;trange fears concerning me, being con|vinced by "<HI>an account taken from one of my own pa|pers,</HI> that I had greatly erred from the faith." I
<PB N="267" REF="029861_0264_0FE2ABCF0BA24580">could not conceive, what paper that &s;hould be; but on enquiry found, it was the &s;ame I had read her my|&s;elf.&mdash;How hard is it to form a true judgment of any per&s;on or thing, from the account of a prejudiced re|later! yea, though he be ever &s;o hone&s;t a man: For he who gave this relation, was one of unque&s;tionable veracity. And yet by his <HI>&s;incere</HI> account of a writing which lay before his eyes, was the truth &s;o totally di&s;gui&s;ed, that my mother knew not the paper &s;he had heard from end to end, nor I that I had my|&s;elf wrote.</P>
<P>At &s;ix I warned the women at Fetter-lane (know|ing how they had been lately &s;haken) <HI>not to believe every &s;pirit, but to try the &s;pirits, whether they were of God.</HI> Our brethren met at eight, when it plea&s;ed God to remove many mi&s;under&s;tandings and offences that had crept in among them: and to re&s;tore in good mea&s;ure <HI>the &s;pirit of love and of a &s;ound mind.</HI></P>
<P>Thur&s;. 14. I went with Mr. Whitefield to Black|heath, where were, I believe, 12 or 14000 people. He a little &s;urpri&s;ed me, by de&s;iring me to preach in his &s;tead; which I did (though nature recoiled) on my favourite &s;ubject, <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who of God is made unto us wi&s;dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;anctification and re|demption.</HI></P>
<P>I was greatly moved with compa&s;&s;ion for the rich that were there, to whom I made a particular ap|plication. Some of them &s;eemed to attend, while others drove away their coaches from &s;o uncouth a preacher.</P>
<P>Frid. 15. I had much talk with one who is called a quaker. But he could not receive my &s;aying.

I intended to &s;peak on Romans iii. 19. but could not tell how to open my mouth: and all the time we were &s;inging, my mind was full of &s;ome place, I knew not where, in the epi&s;tle to the Hebrews. I begged God to direct, and opened the book on Heb. x. 19. <HI>Having there|fore, br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">thren, boldne&s;s to enter into the holie&s;t, by the blood of Je&s;us: by a new and living way which he hath con&s;ecrated for us, through the veil, that is to &s;ay, his fle&s;h.&mdash;Let us draw near with a true heart, in full a&s;&s;urance of faith: having our hearts &s;prinkled from an evil con&s;cience, and our bodies wa&s;hed with pure water.</HI> While I was earne&s;tly inviting all &s;inners to <HI>enter into the holie&s;t by this new and living way,</HI> many of tho&s;e that heard, began to call upon God with &s;trong cries and tears. Some &s;unk down and there remained no &s;trength in them; others exceedingly trembled and quaked; &s;ome were torn with a kind of convul&s;ive moti|on in every part of their bodies, and that &s;o violently, that often four or five per&s;ons could not hold one of them. I have &s;een many hy&s;terical and many epileptie fits: but none of them were like the&s;e, in many re&s;pects. I immediately prayed, "That God would not &s;uffer tho&s;e who were weak to be offended. But one wo|wan was offended greatly; being &s;ure "<HI>they might help it</HI> if they would, no one &s;hould per&s;uade her to the contrary;" and was got three or four yard<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, when &s;he al&s;o dropped down, in as violent an agony as the re&s;t.

But only eighteen came; by talking clo&s;ely with whom I found rea&s;on to believe, that &s;ome of them had gone home to their hou&s;e ju&s;tified.

Sat. 16. We met at Fetter-lane, to humble our|&s;elves before God, and own he had ju&s;tly withdrawn his Spirit from us, for our manifold unfaithfulne&s;s. We acknowledged our having grieved him by our di|vi&s;ions, <HI>one &s;aying, I am of Paul, another, I am of Apollos.</HI> By our leaning again to our own works, and tru&s;ting in them, in&s;tead of Chri&s;t; by our re&s;t|ing in tho&s;e little beginnings of &s;anctification, which it had plea&s;ed him to work in our &s;ouls; and above all, by bla&s;pheming his work among us, imputing it either to nature, to the force of imagination and ani|mal &s;pirits, or even to the delu&s;ion of the devil. In that hour, we found God with us as at the fir&s;t. Some fell pro&s;trate upon the ground. Others bur&s;t out, as with one con&s;ent, into loud prai&s;e and thank&s;|giving. And many openly te&s;tified, there had been no &s;uch day as this &s;ince January the fir&s;t preceding.</P>
<P>Sund. 17. I preached at &s;even in Upper Moor|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ields, to (I believe) &s;ix or &s;even thou&s;and people on, <HI>Ho! every one that thir&s;teth, come ye to the waters.</HI> In the afternoon I &s;aw poor R&mdash;d T&mdash;n, who had left our &s;ociety, and the church. We did not di&s;pute, but pray; and in a &s;hort &s;pace the &s;cales fell off from his eyes. He gladly returned to the church, and was in the evening re-admitted into our &s;ociety.</P>
<P>At five I preached on Kennington-common, to about fifteen thou&s;and people, on tho&s;e words, <HI>Look unto him, and be ye &s;aved, all ye ends of the earth.</HI></P>
<P>Mond. 18. I left London early in the morning, and the next evening reached Bri&s;tol, and preached (as I had appointed, if God &s;hould permit) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o a nu|merous congregation. My text now al&s;o was, <HI>Look unto him, and be ye &s;aved, all ye ends of the earth.</HI> Howel Harris called upon me an hour or two after. He &s;aid, "He had been much di&s;&s;uaded from either hearing or &s;eeing me, by many who &s;aid all manner
<PB N="270" REF="029861_0267_0FE2ABDB06605300">of evil of me. But, &s;aid he, as &s;oon as I heard you preach, I quickly found what &s;pirit you was of. And before you had done, I was &s;o overpowered with joy and love, that I had much ado to walk home."</P>
<P>It is &s;carce credible, what advantage Satan had gain|ed during my ab&s;ence of only eight days. Di&s;putes had crept into our little &s;ociety, &s;o that the love of many was already waxed cold. I &s;hewed them the &s;tate they were in the next day (both at Newgate and at Bapti&s;ts-mills) from tho&s;e words, <HI>Simon, Simon, be|hold Satan hath de&s;ired to have you, that he may &s;ift you as wheat.</HI> And when we met in the evening, in&s;tead of reviving the di&s;pute, we all betook our&s;elves to prayer. Our Lord was with us. Our divi&s;ions were healed. Mi&s;under&s;tandings vani&s;hed away. And all our hearts were &s;weetly drawn together, and united as at the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Frid. 22. I called on one who <HI>did run well,</HI> till he was hindered by &s;ome of tho&s;e called <HI>French pro|phets. Wo unto the prophets, &s;aith the Lord, who pro|phe&s;y in my name, and I have not &s;ent them.</HI> At Wea|ver's-hall, I endeavoured to point them out, and ear|ne&s;tly exhorted all that followed after holine&s;s, to avoid as fire, all who do not &s;peak, according <HI>to the law and the te&s;timony.</HI></P>
<P>In the afternoon I preached at the Fi&s;h-ponds, but had no life or &s;pirit in me; and was much in doubt, whether God would not lay me a&s;ide, and &s;end other labourers into his harve&s;t. I came to the &s;ociety full of this thought; and began in much weakne&s;s to ex|plain, '<HI>Beloved, believe not every &s;pirit, but try the &s;pirits whether they be of God.</HI> I told them, "They were not to judge of the &s;pirit, whereby any one &s;poke, either by <HI>appearances,</HI> or by <HI>common report,</HI> or by their own <HI>inward feelings.</HI> No, nor by any dreams, vi&s;ions or revelations, &s;uppo&s;ed to be made to their &s;ouls, any
<PB N="271" REF="029861_0268_0FE2ABDCC76F0F98">more than by their tears, or any involuntary effects wrought upon their bodies." I warned them, "all the&s;e were in them&s;elves, of a doubtful, di&s;putable nature: they <HI>might</HI> be from God, and they <HI>might not;</HI> and were therefore not &s;imply to be relied on (any more than &s;imply to be condemned) but to be tried by a farther rule, to be brought to the only certain te&s;t, the law and the te&s;timony." While I was &s;peaking, one before me dropped down as dead, and pre&s;ently a &s;econd and a third. Five others &s;unk down in half an hour, mo&s;t of whom were in violent agonies. <HI>The pains <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of hell came about them; the &s;uares of death over<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> them.</HI> In their trouble we called upon the Lord, and he gave us an an&s;wer of peace. One indeed continued an hour in &s;trong pain; and one or two more for three days. But the re&s;t were great|ly comforted in that hour, and went away rejoicing and prai&s;ing God.</P>
<P>Sat. 23. I &s;poke &s;everally with tho&s;e who had been &s;o troubled the night before. Some of them, I found, were only convinced of &s;in; others had indeed found re&s;t to their &s;ouls. This evening ano|ther was &s;eized with &s;trong pangs, But in a &s;hort time her &s;oul was delivered.</P>
<P>Sund. 24. As I was riding to Ro&s;e-green, in a &s;mooth, plain part of the road, my hor&s;e &s;uddenly pitched upon his head, and rolled over and over. I received no other hurt than a little brui&s;e on one &s;ide, which for the pre&s;ent I felt not, but preached with|out pain to 6 or 7000 people on that important di|rection, <HI>Whether ye eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.</HI> In the evening a girl of 13 or 14, and four or five other per&s;ons, &s;ome of whom had felt the power of God before, were deeply con|vinced of &s;in, and with &s;ighs and groans which could not be uttered, called upon God for deliverance.</P>

Mond. 25. About ten in the morning, J&mdash;e C&mdash;r, as &s;he was &s;itting at work, was &s;uddenly &s;eized with grievous terrors of mind, attended with &s;trong trem|bling. Thus &s;he continued all the afternoon; but at the &s;ociety in the evening God turned her heavine&s;s into joy. Five or &s;ix others were al&s;o out to the heart this day: and &s;oon after found him <HI>who&s;e hands make whole:</HI> as did one likewi&s;e, who had been mourning many months, without any to comfort her.</P>
<P>Tue&s;. 26. I preached near the hou&s;e we had a few days before began to build for a &s;chool, in the middle of King&s;wood, under a little &s;ycamore-tree, during a violent &s;torm of rain, on tho&s;e words, <HI>As the rain cometh down from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth and maketh it bring forth and bud:&mdash;So &s;hall my word be that goeth out of my mouth: it &s;hall not return unto me void. But it &s;hall accom|pli&s;h that which I plea&s;e, and it &s;hall pro&s;per in the thing whereto I &s;end it.</HI></P>
<P>Three per&s;ons terribly felt the wrath of God abid|ing on them, at the &s;ociety this evening. But upon prayer made in their behalf, he was plea&s;ed &s;oon to lift up the light of his countenance upon them.</P>
<P>Frid. 29. I preached in a part of King&s;wood, where I never had been before. The places in King&s;wood where I now u&s;ually preached were the&s;e; once a fortnight, a little above Connam, a village on the &s;outh &s;ide of the wood; on Sunday morning, near Hannam-m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">mt: once a fortnight, at the &s;chool-hou&s;e, in the middle of King&s;wood.

<P>Satur. 30. At Weaver's-hall, &s;even or eight per&s;ons were con&s;trained to roar aloud, while the &s;word of the &s;pirit was <HI>dividing a&s;under their &s;ouls and &s;pirits, and joints and marrow.</HI> But they were all relieved upon

<P>I gave a particular account, from time to time, of the manner wherein God here carried on his work, to tho&s;e whom I believed to de&s;ire the increa&s;e of his kingdom, with whom I had any opportunity of corre&s;ponding.

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>I De&s;ire to ble&s;s my Lord, for the good and great news your letter bears, about the Lord's turning many &s;ouls <HI>from darkne&s;s to light, and from the power of Satan unto God;</HI> and that &s;uch <HI>a great and effectual door is opened</HI> among you, as the <HI>many adver&s;aries</HI> can|not &s;hut. O may <HI>He that hath the key of the hou&s;e of David, that openeth and no man &s;hutteth, and &s;hutteth and no man openeth,</HI> &s;et the door of faith more and more open among you, till his hou&s;e be filled and till he gather together the outca&s;ts of I&s;rael. And may that prayer for the adver&s;aries be heard, <HI>Fill their faces with &s;hame, that they may &s;eek thy name, O Lord.</HI></P>
<P>As to the outward manner you &s;peak of, wherein mo&s;t of them were affected who were cut to the heart by the &s;word of the Spirit, no wonder that this was at fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing to you, &s;ince they are indeed &s;o very rare, that have been thus pricked and wounded. Yet &s;ome of the in&s;tances you give &s;eem to be exemplifi|ed, in the outward manner wherein Paul and the jailor were at fir&s;t affected: as al&s;o Peter's hearers, Acts ii. The la&s;t in&s;tance you gave, of &s;ome &s;truggling as in the agonies of death, and in &s;uch a manner as that four or five &s;trong men can hardly re&s;train a weak wo|man from hurting her&s;elf or others: this is to me &s;omewhat more inexplicable: if it do not re&s;emble the child &s;poke of, Mark ix. 26. and Luke ix. 42. of whom it is &s;aid, that <HI>while he was yet a coming, the
<PB N="274" REF="029861_0271_0FE2ABE910B29110">devil threw him down and tare him.</HI> Or what influence &s;udden and &s;harp awakenings may have upon the body I pretend not to explain. But I make no que&s;tion Satan, &s;o far as he gets power, may exert him&s;elf on &s;uch occa&s;ions, partly to hinder the good work in the per&s;ons thus touched with the &s;harp arrows of con|viction, and partly to di&s;parage the work of God, as if it tended to lead people to di&s;traction.&mdash;However, the merciful i&s;&s;ue of the&s;e conflicts in the conver&s;ion of the per&s;ons thus affected, is the main thing.</P>
<P>When they are brought by the &s;aving arm of God to receive Chri&s;t Je&s;us, to have joy and peace in be|lieving, and then to walk in him, and give evidence that the work is a &s;aving work at length, whether more quickly or gradually accompli&s;hed, there is great matter of prai&s;e,&mdash;</P>
<P>All the outward appearances of people's being af|fected among us, may be reduced to the&s;e two &s;orts; one is, hearing with a clo&s;e, &s;ilent attention, with gra|vity and greedine&s;s, di&s;covered by fixed looks, weep|ing eyes, and &s;orrowful or joyful countenances: ano|ther &s;ort is, when they lift up their voice aloud, &s;ome more depre&s;&s;edly, and others more highly; and at times, the whole multitude in a flood of tears, all as it were crying out at once, till their voice be ready to drown the mini&s;ter's, that he can &s;carce be heard for the weeping noi&s;e that &s;urrounds him.&mdash;The influence on &s;ome of the&s;e, like a land-flood, dries up; we hear of no change wrought. But on others, it appears in the fruits of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and the tract of a holy conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>May the Lord &s;trengthen you, to go on in his work! And in praying for the coming of his kingdom with you and us, and I hope you &s;hall not be forgotten among us, in our joint applications to the throne of grace.</P>

Sund. July <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.

<P>A young woman &s;unk down at Ro&s;e-green, in a violent agony both of body and mind: as did five or &s;ix per&s;ons in the evening at the New-room, at who&s;e cries many were greatly offended. The &s;ame offence was given in the morning by one at Weaver's-hall, and by eight or nine others, at Glouce&s;ter-lane in the evening. The fir&s;t that was deeply touched was L&mdash; W&mdash;; who&s;e mother had been not a little di&s;plea&s;ed a day or two before, when &s;he was told, how her daughter had <HI>expo&s;ed her&s;elf</HI> before all the congregation: the mother her&s;elf was the next who dropped down, and lo&s;t her &s;en&s;es in a moment; but went home with her daughter, full of joy, as did mo&s;t of tho&s;e that had been in pain.</P>
<P>Soon after the &s;ociety, I went to Mrs. T&mdash;'s, who&s;e neare&s;t relations were earne&s;tly di&s;&s;uading her, from being <HI>righteous overmuch;</HI> and by the old motive, <HI>Why &s;hould&s;t thou de&s;troy thy&s;elf?</HI> She an&s;wered all they advanced with meekne&s;s and love, and continued &s;tedfa&s;t and immovable. Endure hard&s;hip &s;till, thou good &s;oldier of Chri&s;t! Per&s;ecuted, but not for&s;aken: torn with inward, and encompa&s;&s;ed with outward temptations: but yielding to none. O may patience have its perfect work!</P>
<P>Tue&s;. 3. I preached at Bath to the mo&s;t attentive and &s;erious audience I have ever &s;een there. On Wedne&s;day I preached at Newgate on tho&s;e words, <HI>Becau&s;e of the Phari&s;ees, they dur&s;t not confe&s;s him.&mdash;For they loved the prai&s;e of men more than the prai&s;e of God.</HI> A me&s;&s;age was delivered to me when I had
<PB N="276" REF="029861_0273_0FE2ABEC2B5CE038">done, from the &s;heriffs, "That I mu&s;t preach there no more."</P>
<P>Frid. 6. I pre&s;&s;ed a &s;erious quaker to tell me, Why he did not come to hear me as formerly? he &s;aid, "Becau&s;e he found we were not <HI>led by the Spirit;</HI> for we fixed times of preaching beforehand; whereas we ought to do nothing unle&s;s we were <HI>&s;en&s;ibly moved thereto</HI> by the Holy Gho&s;t." I a&s;ked, "Whether we ought not to do what God in &s;cripture commands, when we have opportunity? Whether the providence of God thus concurring with his word, were not a &s;uf|ficient rea&s;on for our doing it, although we were not at that moment <HI>&s;en&s;ibly moved thereto</HI> by the Holy Gho&s;t?" He an&s;wered, "It was not a &s;ufficient rea&s;on. This was to regard <HI>the letter that killeth.</HI>" God grant, that I may &s;o regard it all the days of my life!</P>
<P>In the afternoon I was with Mr. Whitefield ju&s;t come-from London, with whom I went to Bapti&s;t-mills, where he preached <HI>concerning the Holy Gho&s;t, which all who believe, are to receive;</HI> not without a ju&s;t, though &s;evere, cen&s;ure of tho&s;e, who preach <HI>as if</HI> there were no Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P>Sat. 7. I had an opportunity to talk with him of tho&s;e outward &s;igns, which had &s;o often accompanied the inward work of God. I found his objections were chiefly grounded on gro&s;s mi&s;repre&s;entations of matter of fact. But the next day he had an oppor|tunity of informing him&s;elf better. For no &s;ooner had he begun (in the application of his &s;ermon) to invite all &s;inners, to believe in Chri&s;t, than four per|&s;ons &s;unk down clo&s;e to him, almo&s;t in the &s;ame mo|ment. One of them lay without either &s;en&s;e or mo|tion. A &s;econd trembled exceedingly. The third bad &s;trong convul&s;ions all over his body, but made no noi&s;e, unle&s;s by groans. The fourth, equally con|vul&s;ed, called upon God, with &s;trong cries and tears.

<P>Thur&s;. 13. I went to a gentleman who is much troubled with what they call <HI>lowne&s;s of &s;pirits.</HI> Many &s;uch have I been with before; but in &s;everal of them, it was no bodily di&s;temper. They wanted &s;omething, they knew not what, and were therefore heavy, unea&s;y, and di&s;&s;atisfied with every thing. The plain truth is, they wanted God, they wanted Chri&s;t, they wanted faith. And God convinced them of their want, in a way their phy&s;icians no more under&s;tood than them|&s;elves. Accordingly nothing availed till the Great Phy&s;ician came. For in &s;pite of all natural means, he who made them for him&s;elf, would not &s;uffer them to re&s;t, till they re&s;ted in him.</P>
<P>On Friday in the afternoon I left Bri&s;tol with Mr. Whitefield, in the mid&s;t of heavy rain. But the clouds &s;oon di&s;per&s;ed, &s;o that we had a fair, calm evening, and a &s;erious congregation at Thornbury.</P>
<P>In the morning we breakfa&s;ted with a quaker, who had been brought up in the church of England: but being under &s;trong convictions of inward &s;in, and apply|ing to &s;everal per&s;ons for advice, they all judged him to be under a di&s;order of body, and gave advice ac|cordingly. Some quakers with whom he met about the &s;ame time, told him, it was the hand of God up|on his &s;oul; and advi&s;ed him to &s;eek another &s;ort of relief than tho&s;e mi&s;erable comforters had recommend|ed. <HI>Wo unto you, ye blind leaders of the blind!</HI> How long will ye pervert the right ways of the Lord? Ye who tell the mourners in Zion, Much religion hath made you mad! Ye who &s;end them whom God hath wounded to the devil for cure; to company, idle books or diver&s;ions! Thus &s;hall they peri&s;h in their iniquity; but their blood &s;hall God require at your hands!</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="029861_0275_0FE2ABF65E7D34D0">
We had an attentive congregation at Glouce&s;ter in the evening. In the morning, Mr. Whitefield being gone forward, I preached to about five thou&s;and there, on <HI>Chri&s;t our wi&s;dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;anctification and re|demption.</HI> It rained violently at five in the evening; notwith&s;tanding which two or three thou&s;and people &s;tayed, to whom I expounded that glorious vi&s;ion of Ezekiel, of the re&s;urrection of the dry bones.</P>
<P>Monday 16. After preaching to two or three thou|&s;and on, <HI>What mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved?</HI> I returned to Bri&s;tol, and preached to about three thou&s;and, on tho&s;e words of Job, <HI>There the wicked cea&s;e from troubling; there the weary are at re&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Tue&s;. 17. I rode to Bradford, five miles from Bath, whither I had been long invited to come. I waited on the mini&s;ter, and de&s;ired leave to preach in his church. He &s;aid, "It was not u&s;ual to preach on the week-days: but if I could come thither on a Sunday, he &s;hould be glad of my a&s;&s;i&s;tance." Thence I went to a gentleman in the town, who had been pre&s;ent when I preached at Bath, and with the &s;tronge&s;t marks of &s;incerity and affection, <HI>wi&s;hed me good l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ck in the name of the Lord.</HI> But it was pa&s;t. I found him now quite cold. He began di&s;puting on &s;everal heads, and at la&s;t told me plainly, one of our own college had informed him, "They always took me to be a little crack-brained at Oxford."</P>
<P>However &s;ome per&s;ons who were not of his mind, having pitched upon a convenient place (called Bear-field or Bury-field) on the top of the hill under which the town lies: I there offered Chri&s;t to about a thou|&s;and people, for wi&s;dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;anctification, and redemption. Thence I returned to Bath, and preached on, <HI>What mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved?</HI> to a larger audience than ever before. I was wondering the God of this world was &s;o &s;till: when at my return from the place of preaching, poor R&mdash; d M&mdash;l told me,

Who is above thee, but they who indeed <HI>wor|&s;hip God in &s;pirit and in truth?</HI> Not even tho&s;e who have one foot in the grave! Not even tho&s;e who dwell in rooms of cedar; and who have heaped up gold as the du&s;t, and &s;ilver as the &s;and of the &s;ea!</P>
<P>Sat. 21. I began expounding a &s;econd time our Lord's &s;ermon on the mount. In the morning, Sun|day 22, as I was explaining <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are the poor in &s;pi|rit,</HI> to about three thou&s;and people, we had a fair op|portunity of &s;hewing all men what manner of &s;pirit we were of. For in the middle of the &s;ermon, the pre&s;s-gang came, and &s;eized on one of the hearers (ye learned in the law, what becomes of <HI>magna charta,</HI> and of <HI>Engli&s;h liberty and property?</HI> Are not the&s;e mere &s;ounds, while, on any pretence, there is &s;uch a thing as a pre&s;s-gang &s;uffered in the land?) all the re&s;t &s;tanding &s;till, and none opening his mouth or lifting up his hand to re&s;i&s;t them.</P>
<P>Mond. 23. To guard young converts from fancying, that they had already attained or were already perfect, I preached on tho&s;e words, <HI>So is the kingdom of God, as when a man ca&s;teth &s;eed into the ground&mdash;And ri&s;eth day and night, and the &s;eed buddeth forth and &s;pringeth up he knoweth not how&mdash;fir&s;t the blade, then the ear, then the full corn in the ear.</HI></P>
<P>On &s;everal evenings this week, and particularly on Friday, many were deeply convinced; but none were delivered from that painful conviction, <HI>The children came to the birth; but there was not &s;trength to bring forth.</HI> I fear we have grieved the Spirit of the jealous God, by que&s;tioning his work: and that therefore he is with|drawn
<PB N="280" REF="029861_0277_0FE2ABFA6B310D78">from us for a &s;ea&s;on. <HI>But he will return and abundantly pardon.</HI></P>
<P>Mond. 30. Two more were in &s;trong pain, both their &s;ouls and bodies being well-nigh torn a&s;under. But though we cried unto God, there was no an&s;wer, nei|ther did he as yet deliver them at all.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e had been remarkably zealous again&s;t tho&s;e that cried out and made a noi&s;e, being &s;ure that <HI>any of them might help it if they would.</HI> And the &s;ame opinion &s;he was in &s;till, till the moment &s;he was &s;truck through as with a &s;word, and fell trembling to the ground. She then cried aloud, though not articulate|ly, her words being &s;wallowed up. In this pain &s;he continued twelve or fourteen hours, and then her &s;oul was &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> at liberty. But her ma&s;ter (for &s;he was a &s;er|vant till that time, at a gentleman's in town) forbid her returning to him, &s;aying, <HI>He would have none in his hou&s;e who had received the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Tue&s;. 31. I preached at Bradford to above two thou&s;and, many of whom were of the better rank, on <HI>What mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved?</HI> They all behaved with decency, and none went away till the &s;ervice was end|ed. While I was preaching at Bath, on my return, &s;ome of the audience did not behave &s;o well; being, I fear, a little too nearly concerned, when I came to the application of tho&s;e words, <HI>Not only this our craft is in danger to be &s;et at nought: but al&s;o that the temple of the great godde&s;s Diana &s;hould be de&s;pi&s;ed&mdash;whom all A&s;ia and the world wor&s;hippeth.</HI></P>
<P>Having <HI>a caution again&s;t religious delu&s;ion,</HI> put into my hands about this time, I thought it my duty to write to the author of it: which I accordingly did, in the following terms:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<PB N="281" REF="029861_0278_0FE2ABFC2A6C5230">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P N="1">1. YOU charge me (for I am called a <HI>Methodi&s;t,</HI> and con&s;equently included within your charge) with <HI>vain and confident boa&s;tings, ra&s;h, uncharitable cen|&s;ure, damning all who do not</HI> feel <HI>what I</HI> feel; <HI>not al|lowing men to be in a &s;alvable &s;tate, unle&s;s they have ex|perienced &s;ome</HI> &s;udden <HI>operation, which may be di&s;tingui&s;h|ed as the hand of God upon them, overpowering as it were the &s;oul:</HI> with <HI>denying men the u&s;e of God's crea|tures, which he hath appointed to be received with thank&s;|giving, and encouraging ab&s;tinence, prayer, and other reli|gious exerci&s;es, to the neglect of the duties of our &s;tation.</HI> O Sir, can you prove this charge upon me? The Lord &s;hall judge in that day!</P>
<P N="2">2. I do indeed go out into the highways and hedges to call poor &s;inners to Chri&s;t. But not <HI>in a tumultuous manner,</HI> not <HI>to the di&s;turbance of the public peace,</HI> or <HI>the prejudice of families.</HI> Neither herein do I break any law which I know; much <HI>le&s;s &s;et at nought all rule and authority.</HI> Nor can I be &s;aid to <HI>intrude into the labours</HI> of tho&s;e, who do not labour at all; but &s;uffer thou|&s;ands of tho&s;e for whom Chri&s;t died, to <HI>peri&s;h for lack of knowledge.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. They peri&s;h for want of knowing, that <HI>we</HI> as well as the Heathens, <HI>are alienated from the life of God;</HI> that <HI>every one of us</HI> by the corruption of our inmo&s;t nature, <HI>is very far gone from original righteou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> &s;o far, that <HI>every per&s;on born into the world, de&s;erveth God's wrath and damnation:</HI> that we have by nature no pow|er either to help our&s;elves, or even to call upon God to help us; all our tempers and works, in our natural &s;tate, being only evil continually. So that <HI>our</HI> com|ing to Chri&s;t, as well as <HI>theirs, mu&s;t infer a great and mighty change.</HI> It mu&s;t infer, not only an <HI>outward change,</HI> from &s;tealing, lying and all corrupt communi|cation; but a thorough <HI>change of heart,</HI> an <HI>inward</HI>
<PB N="282" REF="029861_0279_0FE2AC080A405BF0">renewal of the &s;pirit of our mind. Accordingly, <HI>the old man</HI> implies infinitely more than <HI>outward, evil conver&s;ation,</HI> even <HI>an evil heart of unbelief,</HI> corrupted by pride and a thou&s;and deceitful lu&s;ts. Of con&s;equence, the <HI>new man</HI> mu&s;t imply infinitely more than <HI>outward, good conver&s;ation,</HI> even <HI>a good heart, which after God is created in righteou&s;ne&s;s and true holine&s;s:</HI> a heart full of that faith, which working by love, produces all holi|ne&s;s of conver&s;ation.</P>
<P N="4">4. The change from the former of the&s;e &s;tates to the latter, is what I call <HI>The new birth.</HI> But you &s;ay, I am <HI>not content with this plain and ea&s;y notion of it, but fill my&s;elf and others with fanta&s;tical conceits</HI> about it. Alas, Sir, how can you prove this? And if you can|not prove it, what amends can you make, either to God, or to me, or to the world, for publicly a&s;&s;erting a gro&s;s fal&s;ehood?</P>
<P N="5">5. Perhaps you &s;ay, <HI>You can prove this of Mr.</HI> Whitefield. What then? This is nothing to me. I am not accountable for <HI>his</HI> words. The journal you quote I never &s;aw till it was in print. But indeed you wrong him as much as me: fir&s;t, where you repre|&s;ent him as judging the notions of the Quakers <HI>in general</HI> (concerning being led by the Spirit) to be right and good; whereas he &s;peaks only of tho&s;e <HI>particular men,</HI> with whom he was then conver&s;ing. And again, where you &s;ay, he <HI>&s;uppo&s;es</HI> a per&s;on <HI>believ|ing in Chri&s;t,</HI>&mdash;to be without any <HI>&s;aving knowledge</HI> of him. He <HI>&s;uppo&s;es</HI> no &s;uch thing. <HI>To believe in Chri&s;t</HI> is the very thing he <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> wanting; as un|der&s;tanding that term <HI>believing</HI> to imply, not only an a&s;&s;ent to the articles of our creed, but al&s;o <HI>a true tru&s;t and confidence of the mercy of God through our Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Now this it is certain a man may want, although he can truly &s;ay, <HI>I am cha&s;te, I am &s;ober, I am ju&s;t in my dealings, I help my neighbour and u&s;e the ordinances
<PB N="283" REF="029861_0280_0FE2AC0A18E90B70">of God. And however</HI> &s;uch a man <HI>may have behaved in the&s;e re&s;pects, he is not to think well of his own &s;tate, till he experiences &s;omething within him&s;elf, which he has not yet experienced,</HI> but <HI>which he may be before-hand, a&s;&s;ured he &s;hall,</HI> if the promi&s;es of God are true. That <HI>&s;omething</HI> is, a living faith: <HI>A &s;ure tru&s;t and con|fidence in God, that by the merits of Chri&s;t his &s;ins are forgiven, and he reconciled to the favour of God.</HI> And from this will &s;pring many other things, which till then he experienced not; as, the love of God &s;hed abroad in his heart, the peace of God which pa&s;&s;eth all under&s;tanding, and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t, joy though not <HI>unfelt,</HI> yet <HI>un&s;peakable</HI> and full of glory.</P>
<P N="7">7. The&s;e are &s;ome of tho&s;e <HI>inward fruits of the Spirit,</HI> which mu&s;t be <HI>felt,</HI> where&s;oever they are: and without the&s;e, I cannot learn from holy writ, that any man is <HI>born of the Spirit.</HI> I be&s;eech you, Sir, by the mercies of God, that if as yet you <HI>know no|thing of &s;uch inward feelings,</HI> if you do not <HI>feel in your&s;elf the&s;e mighty workings of the Spirit of Chri&s;t,</HI> at lea&s;t you would not contradict and bla&s;pheme. When the Holy Gho&s;t hath fervently kindled <HI>your</HI> love to|wards God, you will know the&s;e to be very <HI>&s;en&s;ible</HI> operations. <HI>As you hear the wind and feel it too,</HI> while <HI>it &s;trikes upon your bodily organs,</HI> you will know you are under the guidance of God's Spirit the &s;ame way, namely, by <HI>feeling it in your &s;oul:</HI> by the pre&s;ent peace and joy and love which you feel within, as well as by its outward and more di&s;tant effects.</P>

<P>I have often wi&s;hed, that all calm and impartial men, would con&s;ider what is advanced by another writer, in a little di&s;cour&s;e concerning enthu&s;ia&s;m or religious delu&s;ion, publi&s;hed about this time. His words are,</P>

<P N="4">4.

<P>Friday, Augu&s;t 3. I met with one who <HI>did</HI> run well, but Satan had hindered her. I was &s;urpri&s;ed at her inge|nuous acknowledgment of the fear of man. <HI>O how hardly &s;hall</HI> even <HI>they who have rich</HI> acquaintance <HI>enter into the kingdom of heaven.</HI></P>
<P>Sund. 5. Six per&s;ons at the New-room were deeply <HI>convinced of &s;in:</HI> three of whom were a lit|tle comforted by prayer; but not yet <HI>convinced of righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Having frequently been invited to Wells, particu|larly by Mr. &mdash;, who begged me to make his hou&s;e my home, on Thur&s;day the 9th I went thither, and wrote him word the night before; upon which he pre|&s;ently went to one of his friends, and de&s;ired a me&s;&s;enger might be &s;ent to meet me and beg me "To turn back, otherwi&s;e (&s;aid he) we &s;hall lo&s;e all our trade." But this con&s;ideration did not weigh with him, &s;o that he invited me to his own hou&s;e: and at eleven I preach|ed in his ground, on <HI>Chri&s;t our wi&s;dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;anc|tification, and redemption,</HI> to about 2000 per&s;ons. Some of them mocked at fir&s;t, whom I reproved before all; and tho&s;e of them who &s;tayed were more &s;erious.
<PB N="286" REF="029861_0283_0FE2AC1630EE8128">Several &s;poke to me after, who were for the pre&s;ent much affected. O let it not pa&s;s away as the morn|ing dew!</P>
<P>Frid. 10. I had the &s;atisfaction of conver&s;ing with a Quaker, and afterwards with an Anabapti&s;t, who, I tru&s;t, have had a large mea&s;ure of the love of God &s;hed abroad in their hearts. O may tho&s;e, in every per&s;ua&s;ion, who are of this &s;pirit, increa&s;e a thou&s;and|fold, how many &s;o ever they be!</P>
<P>Sat. 11. In the evening two were &s;eized with &s;trong pangs, as were four the next evening, and the &s;ame number at Glouce&s;ter-lane on Monday, one of whom was greatly comforted.</P>
<P>Tue&s;. 14. I preached at Bradford to about three thou&s;and, on, <HI>One thing is needful.</HI> Returning through Bath, I preached to a &s;mall congregation &s;uddenly gathered together at a little di&s;tance from the town (not being permitted to be in R&mdash; M&mdash;'s ground any more) on, <HI>The ju&s;t &s;hall live by faith.</HI> Three at the New-room this evening were cut to the heart. But their wound was not as yet healed.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;. 15. I endeavoured to guard tho&s;e who were in their fir&s;t love, from falling into inordinate affection, by explaining tho&s;e &s;trange words at Bapti&s;t-mills, <HI>Henceforth know we no man after the fle&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>Friday 17. Many of our &s;ociety met, as we had appointed, at one in the afternoon, and agreed "That all the members of our &s;ociety &s;hould obey the church to which we belong, by ob&s;erving <HI>all</HI> Fridays <HI>in the year, as days of fa&s;ting or ab&s;tinence.</HI>" We likewi&s;e agreed, that as many as had opportunity &s;hould then meet, to &s;pend an hour together in prayer.</P>
<P>Wedn. 22. I was with many that were in heavine&s;s: two of whom were &s;oon filled with peace and joy. In the afternoon I endeavoured to guard the weak again&s;t what too often occa&s;ions heavine&s;s, levity of temper or
<PB N="287" REF="029861_0284_0FE2AC18D5A56990">behaviour, from, <HI>I &s;aid of laughter, it is mad; and of mirth, What doth it?</HI></P>
<P>Mond. 27. For two hours I took up my cro&s;s, in arguing with a zealous man, and labouring to convince him, <Q>That I was not an enemy to the church of England.</Q> He allowed, <Q>I taught no other doctrines than tho&s;e of the church;</Q> but could not forgive my teaching them <HI>out of the church-walls.</HI> He allowed too (which none indeed can deny, who has either any regard to truth or &s;en&s;e of &s;hame) that <Q>by this teaching many &s;ouls who till that time were pe|ri&s;hing for lack of knowledge, have been, and are brought from darkne&s;s to light and from the power of Satan unto God.</Q> But he added, <Q>No one can tell, what <HI>may be hereafter;</HI> and <HI>therefore</HI> I &s;ay, the&s;e things ought not to be &s;uffered.</Q></P>
<P>Indeed the report now current in Bri&s;tol was, "That I was a <HI>Papi&s;t,</HI> if not a <HI>Je&s;uit.</HI>" Some added, <Q>That I was born and bred at Rome;</Q> which many cor|dially believed. O ye fools, when will ye under&s;tand, that the preaching <HI>ju&s;tification by faith alone,</HI> the allow|ing no meritorious cau&s;e of ju&s;tification, but the death and righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, and no conditional or in|&s;trumental cau&s;e, but faith, is overturning popery from the foundation? When will ye under&s;tand, that the mo&s;t de&s;tructive of all tho&s;e errors, which Rome, the mother of abominations hath brought forth (com|pared to which tran&s;ub&s;tantiation and a hundred more, are trifles light as air) is, <HI>That we are ju&s;tified by works</HI> (or to expre&s;s the &s;ame thing a little more decently) by faith <HI>and</HI> works. Now, do I preach <HI>This?</HI> I did for ten years; I was (fundamentally) a papi&s;t, and knew it not. But I do now te&s;tify to all (and it is the ve|ry point for a&s;&s;erting which I have to this day been called in que&s;tion) that "no good works can be done before ju&s;tification, none which have not in them the nature of &s;in."</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="029861_0285_0FE2AC1A62AF5D30">
I have often enquired, who are the authors of this report; and have generally found they were either bigotted di&s;&s;enters, or (I &s;peak without fear or favour) mini&s;ters of our own church. I have al&s;o frequently con&s;idered, what po&s;&s;ible ground or motive they could have thus to &s;peak: &s;eeing few men in the world have had occa&s;ion &s;o clearly and openly to declare their principles, as I have done, both by preaching, print|ing, and conver&s;ation, for &s;everal years la&s;t pa&s;t. And I can no otherwi&s;e think, than that either they &s;poke thus (to put the mo&s;t favourable con&s;truction upon it) from gro&s;s ignorance: they knew not what popery was; they knew not what doctrines tho&s;e are which the Papi&s;ts teach: or they wilfully &s;poke what they knew to be fal&s;e, probably <HI>thinking</HI> thereby <HI>to do God &s;ervice.</HI> Now, take this to your&s;elves, who&s;oever ye are, high or low, di&s;&s;enters or churchmen, clergy or laity, who have advanced this &s;hamele&s;s charge, and dige&s;t it how you can.</P>
<P>But how have ye not been afraid, if ye believe there is a God, and that he knoweth the &s;ecrets of your hearts (I &s;peak now to you, preachers, more e&s;pecially, of whatever denomination) to declare &s;o gro&s;s, palpable a lie, in the name of the God of truth? I cite you all before the Judge of all the earth, either publicly to prove your charge; or by publicly retract|ing it, to make the be&s;t amends you can, to God, to me, and to the world.</P>
<P>For the full &s;atisfaction of tho&s;e who have been abu&s;ed by the&s;e &s;hamele&s;s men, and almo&s;t brought to believe a lie, I will here add my &s;erious judgment concerning the church of Rome, wrote &s;ome time &s;ince to a prie&s;t of that communion.</P>

<P>Yet I can by no means approve the &s;currility and contempt with which the Romani&s;ts have often been treated. I dare not rail at or de&s;pi&s;e any man: much le&s;s tho&s;e who profe&s;s to believe in the &s;ame Ma&s;ter. But I pity them much; having the &s;ame a&s;&s;urance,
<PB N="290" REF="029861_0287_0FE2AC26264954A0">that Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t, and that no Romani&s;t can ex|pect to be &s;aved, according to the terms of his cove|nant.

<P>And fir&s;t, All Romani&s;ts, as &s;uch, do break and teach men to break, one (and not the lea&s;t) of tho&s;e commandments; the words of which, concerning images are the&s;e, <Q><GAP DESC="foreign"></Q> Now <GAP DESC="foreign">(as every &s;matterer in Hebrew knows) is <HI>incurvare &s;e,

<P>Tue&s;d. 28. My mouth was opened, and my heart enlarged, &s;trongly to declare to above two thou&s;and people at Bradford, That <HI>the kingdom of God</HI> (within us) <HI>is not meat and drink, but righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> At Bath I once more of|fered <HI>Chri&s;t to ju&s;tify the ungodly.</HI> In the evening I met my brother, ju&s;t come from London. <HI>The Lord hath</HI> indeed <HI>done great things for us already. Not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> us, but unto thy name be the prai&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Wedne&s;day 29. I rode with my brother to Wells and preached on, <HI>What mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved?</HI> In the evening I &s;ummed up at the New-room, what I had &s;aid at many times, from the beginning, of faith, holine&s;s and good works, as the root, the tree and the fruit, which God had joined, and man ought not to put a&s;under.</P>
<P>Friday, Aug. 31. I left Bri&s;tol, and reached London, about eight on Sunday morning. In the afternoon I heard a &s;ermon wherein it was a&s;&s;erted, that our repentance was not &s;incere, but feigned and hypocritical, 1. If we relap&s;ed into &s;in, <HI>&s;oon after</HI> re|penting: e&s;pecially if 2. We did not <HI>avoid all occa&s;i|ons</HI> of &s;in, or if 3. We <HI>relap&s;ed frequently;</HI> and mo&s;t of all, if 4. Our hearts were <HI>hardened</HI> thereby. O what a hypocrite was I (if this be &s;o) for near twice ten years! But I know it is not &s;o. I know every
<PB N="292" REF="029861_0289_0FE2AC29493C6910">one <HI>under the law,</HI> is even as I was. Every one when he begins to &s;ee his fallen &s;tate, and to feel the wrath of God abiding on him, relap&s;es into the &s;in that mo&s;t ea&s;ily be&s;ets him, <HI>&s;oon after</HI> repenting of it. Some|times he avoids, and at many other times cannot per|&s;uade him&s;elf to <HI>avoid the occa&s;ions</HI> of it. Hence his relap&s;es are <HI>frequent,</HI> and of con&s;equence his <HI>heart is hardened</HI> more and more. And yet all this time, he is <HI>&s;incerely</HI> &s;triving again&s;t &s;in. He can &s;ay <HI>un&s;eigned|ly, without hypocri&s;y, the thing which I do, I approve not; the evil which I would not, that I do. To will is</HI> even then <HI>pre&s;ent with</HI> him; <HI>but how to perform that which is good, he finds not.</HI> Nor can he, with all his <HI>&s;incerity</HI> avoid any one of the&s;e four marks of <HI>hypocri&s;y,</HI> till <HI>being ju&s;tified by faith, he hath peace with God, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</HI></P>
<P>This helple&s;s &s;tate I took occa&s;ion to de&s;cribe at Kennington, to eight or ten thou&s;and people, from tho&s;e words of the p&s;almi&s;t, <HI>Innumerable troubles are come about me; my &s;ine have taken &s;uch hold upon me, that I am not able to look up: yea, they are more in number than the hairs of my head, and my heart hath failed me.</HI></P>
<P>Mond. Sept. 3. I talked largely with my mother, who told me, that till a &s;hort time &s;ince, &s;he had &s;carce heard &s;uch a thing mentioned, as the having forgive|ne&s;s of &s;ins now, or God's Spirit bearing witne&s;s with our &s;pirit: much le&s;s did &s;he imagine, that this was the common privilege of all true believers. "There|fore (&s;aid &s;he) I never dur&s;t a&s;k for it my&s;elf. But two or three weeks ago, while my &s;on Hall was pro|nouncing tho&s;e words, in delivering the cup to me, <HI>The blood of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which was given for</HI> thee; the words &s;truck through my heart, and I knew God for Chri&s;t's &s;ake had forgiven <HI>me</HI> all <HI>my</HI> &s;ins."</P>
<P>I a&s;ked, Whether her father (Dr. Anne&s;ley) had not the &s;ame faith? And whether &s;he had not heard
<PB N="293" REF="029861_0290_0FE2AC2AD91F9C30">him preach it to others? She an&s;wered, "He had it him&s;elf, and declared a little before his death, that for more than forty years, he had no darkne&s;s, no fear, no doubt at all, of his being <HI>accepted in the Beloved.</HI> But that neverthele&s;s, &s;he did not remember to have heard him preach, no, not once, explicitly upon it: whence &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed he al&s;o looked upon it as the pecu|liar ble&s;&s;ing of a <HI>few,</HI> not as promi&s;ed to all the peo|ple of God."</P>
<P>Both at Mr. B&mdash;'s at &s;ix, and at Dowgate-hill at eight, were many more than the hou&s;es could con|tain. Several per&s;ons who were then convinced of &s;in, came to me the next morning. One came al&s;o, who had been mourning long, and earne&s;tly de&s;ired us to pray with her. We had &s;carce begun, when the enemy began to tear her, &s;o that &s;he &s;creamed out as in the pangs of death. But his time was &s;hort: for within a quarter of an hour, &s;he was full of the peace that pa&s;&s;eth all under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>I afterwards called on Mrs. E&mdash;r, with whom was one lately come from Bri&s;tol, in deep angui&s;h of &s;pirit. We cried to God, and he &s;oon declared his &s;alvation, &s;o that both their mouths were filled with his prai&s;e.</P>
<P>Thence I went to a poor woman who had been long in de&s;pair. I was glad to meet with Mrs. R&mdash; there; the per&s;on mentioned in Mr. Whitefield's jour|nal, who after three years madne&s;s (&s;o called) was &s;o deeply convinced of &s;in at Beach-lane, and &s;oon after rejoiced in God <HI>her</HI> Saviour.</P>
<P>Thur&s;. 6. I was &s;ent for by one who began to <HI>feel</HI> her&s;elf a &s;inner. But a fine lady unexpectedly com|ing in, there was &s;carce room for <HI>me</HI> to &s;peak. The fourth per&s;on in the company was a poor unbred girl; who beginning to tell what God had done for her &s;oul, the others looked one at another, as in amaze, but did not open their mouths. I then exhorted them,
<PB N="294" REF="029861_0291_0FE2AC328674A238">not to cea&s;e from crying to God, till they too could &s;ay, as &s;he did, "My beloved is mine, and I am his: I am as &s;ure of it, as that I am alive. For his &s;pirit bears witne&s;s with my &s;pirit, that I am a child of God."</P>
<P>Sund. 9. I declared to about ten thou&s;and in Moorfields, what they mu&s;t do to be &s;aved. My mo|ther went with us about five to Kennington, where were &s;uppo&s;ed to be twenty thou&s;and people. I again in&s;i&s;ted on that foundation of all our hope, <HI>Believe in the Lord Je&s;us, and thou &s;halt be &s;aved.</HI> From Ken|nington I went to a &s;ociety at Lambeth. The hou&s;e being filled, the re&s;t &s;tood in the garden. The deep attention they &s;hewed gave me a good hope, that they will not all be forgetful hearers.</P>
<P>Thence I went to our &s;ociety at Fetter-lane, and exhorted them to love one another. The want of love was a general complaint. We laid it open be|fore our Lord. We &s;oon found, he had &s;ent us an an&s;wer of peace. Evil &s;urmi&s;ings vani&s;hed away. The flame kindled again as at the fir&s;t, and our hearts were knit together.</P>
<P>Mond. 10. I accepted a pre&s;&s;ing invitation to go to Plai&s;tow. At five in the evening I expound|ed there, and at eight again. But mo&s;t of the hear|ers were very quiet and unconcerned. In the morn|ing therefore I &s;poke &s;tronger words. But it is only the voice of the Son of God, which is able to wake the dead.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;. 12. In the evening at Fetter-lane, I de&s;cribed the life of faith, and many who had fan|cied them&s;elves &s;trong therein, found they were no more than new-born babes. At eight I exhorted our brethren to keep clo&s;e to the church, and to all the ordinances of God, and to aim only at liv|ing <HI>a quiet and peaceable life, in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="029861_0292_0FE2AC3433F112C8">
Thur&s;. 13. A &s;erious clergyman de&s;ired to know, in what points we differ from the church of England? I an&s;wered, "To the be&s;t of my knowledge, in none: the doctrines we preach, are the doctrines of the church of England: indeed the fundamental doctrines of the church, clearly laid down, both in her prayers, arti|cles, and homilies."</P>
<P>He a&s;ked, in what points then do you differ from the other clergy of the church of England? I an&s;wer|ed, "In none from that part of the clergy who ad|here to the doctrines of the church; but from that part of the clergy who di&s;&s;ent from the church (though they own it not) I differ in the points following:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, They &s;peak of ju&s;tification, either as the &s;ame thing with &s;anctification, or as &s;omething con|&s;equent upon it. I believe ju&s;tification to be wholly di&s;tinct from &s;anctification, and nece&s;&s;arily antecedent to it.</P>
<P>Secondly, They &s;peak of our own holine&s;s or good works, as the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of our ju&s;tification; or, that <HI>for the &s;ake of which, on account of which</HI> we are ju&s;ti|fied before God. I believe, neither our own holine&s;s nor good works, are any part of the cau&s;e of our ju&s;tification; but that the death and righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, are the whole and &s;ole cau&s;e of it; or, that <HI>for the &s;ake of which, on account of which,</HI> we are ju&s;|tified before God.</P>
<P>Thirdly, They &s;peak of good works, as a <HI>condition</HI> of ju&s;tification, nece&s;&s;arily previous to it. I believe no good work can be previous to ju&s;tification, nor con&s;equently a condition of it: but that we are ju&s;ti|fied (being till that hour ungodly, and therefore in|capable of doing any good work) by faith alone, faith without works, faith (though producing all, yet) including no good work.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="029861_0293_0FE2AC35C85D5B80">
Fourthly, They &s;peak of <HI>&s;anctification</HI> (or holine&s;s) as if it were an outward thing, as if it con&s;i&s;ted chiefly, if not wholly, in the&s;e two points, 1. The doing no harm, 2. The doing good (as it is called) i. e. The u&s;ing the means of grace, and helping our neighbour.</P>
<P>I believe it to be, an inward thing, namely, <HI>The life of God in the &s;oul of man; a participation of the divine nature; the mind that was in Chri&s;t;</HI> or, <HI>the renewal of our heart, after the image of him that created us.</HI></P>
<P>La&s;tly, They &s;peak of the <HI>new birth,</HI> as an <HI>outward</HI> thing, as if it were no more than bapti&s;m; or, at mo&s;t, a change from <HI>outward wickedne&s;s</HI> to <HI>outward goodne&s;s;</HI> from a <HI>vicious</HI> to (what is called) a <HI>virtuous</HI> life. I be|lieve it to be an inward thing; a change from inward wickedne&s;s to inward goodne&s;s; an entire change of our inmo&s;t nature from the image of the devil (where|in we are born) to the image of God: a change from the love of the creature to the love of the Creator, from earthly and &s;en&s;ual, to heavenly and holy affec|tions: in a word, a change from the <HI>tempers</HI> of the &s;pirits of darkne&s;s, to tho&s;e of the angels of God in heaven.</P>
<P>There is therefore a wide, e&s;&s;ential, fundamental, irreconcileable difference between us: &s;o that if they &s;peak the truth as it is in Je&s;us, I am found a fal&s;e witne&s;s before God. But if I teach the way of God in truth, they are blind leaders of the blind.</P>
<P>Sund. 16. I preached at Moorfields to about ten thou&s;and, and at Kennington common to I believe near twenty thou&s;and, on tho&s;e words of the calmer Jews to St. Paul, <HI>We de&s;ire to hear of thee what thou thinke&s;t: for as concerning this &s;ect, we know that every where it is &s;poken again&s;t.</HI> At both places I de&s;cribed the real difference between what is generally called Chri&s;tianity, and the true <HI>old Chri&s;tianity,</HI> which un|der

<P>Mond. 17. I preached again <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>are tho&s;e that mourn.</HI> It plea&s;ed God to give us in that hour, two living in&s;tances of that piercing &s;en&s;e both of the guilt and power of &s;in, that dread of the wrath of God, and that full conviction of man's inability either to remove the power, or atone for the guilt of &s;in (called by the world de&s;pair) in which properly con|&s;i&s;t that poverty of &s;pirit and mourning which are the gate of Chri&s;tian ble&s;&s;edne&s;s.</P>
<P>Tue&s;. 18. A young woman came to us at I&s;ling|ton, in &s;uch an agony as I have &s;eldom &s;een. Her &s;orrow and fear were too big for utterance; &s;o that after a few w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ds, her &s;trength as well as her heart failing, &s;he &s;unk down to the ground. Only her &s;ighs and her groans &s;hewed &s;he was yet alive. We cried unto God in her behalf. We claimed the promi&s;es made to the weary and heavy-laden: and he did not ca&s;t out our prayer. She &s;aw her Saviour, as it were, crucified before her eyes. She laid hold on him by faith, and her &s;pirit revived.</P>
<P>At Mr. B&mdash;'s at &s;ix, I was enabled earne&s;tly to call all the weary and heavy-laden: and at Mr. C&mdash;'s at eight, when many roared aloud; &s;ome of whom ut|terly refu&s;ed to be comforted, till they &s;hould feel their &s;ouls at re&s;t in the blood of the Lamb, and have his love &s;hed abroad in their hearts.</P>
<P>Thur&s;. 20. Mrs. C&mdash; being in deep heavine&s;s, had de&s;ired me to meet her this afternoon. She had long earne&s;tly de&s;ired to receive the holy communion, having an unaccountably &s;trong per&s;ua&s;ion, "That God would manife&s;t him&s;elf to her therein, and give re&s;t to her &s;oul." But her heavine&s;s being now greatly in|crea&s;ed, Mr. D&mdash;e gave her that fatal advice, "Not to communicate <HI>till &s;he had</HI> living faith." This &s;till added to her perplexity. Yet at length &s;he re&s;olved
<PB N="298" REF="029861_0295_0FE2AC3F4AE33758">to obey God father than man. And <HI>he was made known unto her in breaking of bread.</HI> In that moment &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> her load removed, &s;he knew &s;he was accepted in the beloved; and all the time I was expounding at Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&mdash;'s, was full of that peace which cannot be uttered.</P>
<P>Frid. 21. Another of Dr. Monro's patients came to de&s;ire my advice. I found no rea&s;on to believe &s;he had been any otherwi&s;e <HI>mad</HI> than every one is, who is deeply convinced of &s;in. And I cannot doubt, but if &s;he will tru&s;t in the living God, he will <HI>give medi|cine to heal her &s;ickne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Sund. 23. I declared to about ten thou&s;and in Moorfields, with great enlargement of &s;pirit, <HI>The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> At Kennington I enforced to about twenty thou&s;and, that great truth, <HI>One thing is needful.</HI> Thence I went to Lambeth and &s;hewed (to the amazement, it &s;eemed, of many who were pre&s;ent) how <HI>he that is born of God doth not commit &s;in.</HI></P>
<P>Mond. 24. I preached once more at Plai&s;tow, and took my leave of the people of that place. In my return, a per&s;on galloping &s;wiftly, rode full again&s;t me, and overthrew both man and hor&s;e: but without any hurt to either. Glory be to him who <HI>&s;aves both man and bea&s;t!</HI></P>
<P>Tue&s;. 25. After dining with one of our brethren who was married this day, I went (as u&s;ual) to the &s;ociety at St. James's, weary and weak in body. But God &s;trengthened me for his own work; as he did at &s;ix at Mr. B&mdash;'s; and at eight in Winche&s;ter-yard, where it was believed were pre&s;ent eleven or twelve hundred per&s;ons: to whom I declared, if <HI>they had nothing to pay, God</HI> would <HI>frankly forgive them</HI> all.</P>

Thur&s;. 27. I went in the afternoon to a &s;ociety at Deptford, and thence at &s;ix came to Turner's-hall; which holds (by computation) two thou&s;and per&s;ons. The pre&s;s both within and without was ve|ry great. In the beginning of the expounding, there being a large vault beneath, the main beam which &s;upported the floor, broke. The floor immediately &s;unk, which occa&s;ioned much noi&s;e and confu&s;ion among the people. But, two or three days before a man had filled the vault with hog&s;heads of to|bacco. So that the floor, after &s;inking a foot or two, re&s;ted upon them, and I went on without in|terruption.</P>
<P>Frid. 28.

But upon prayer made for her, &s;he was in&s;tantly relieved, and re&s;tored to a found mind.</P>
<P>Mond. October 1. I rode to Oxford; and found a few who had not yet for&s;aken the a&s;&s;embling them|&s;elves together: to whom I explained that <HI>holine&s;s without which no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Tue&s;. 2. I went to many, who once heard the word with joy; but <HI>when the &s;un aro&s;e, the &s;eed wi|thered away.</HI> Yet &s;ome &s;till <HI>de&s;ired</HI> to follow their Lord. But the world &s;tood fawning or threatening between them. In the evening I &s;hewed them the tender mercies of God, and his readine&s;s &s;till to re|ceive them. The tears ran down many of their cheeks. O thou lover of &s;ouls, &s;eek and &s;ave that which is lo&s;t!</P>
<P>Wedne&s;. 3. I had a little lei&s;ure to take a view of the &s;hattered condition of things here. The poor pri&s;oners both in the ca&s;tle and in the city pri&s;on, had
<PB N="300" REF="029861_0297_0FE2AC42663C0278">now none that cared for their &s;ouls, none to in&s;truct, advi&s;e, comfort and build them up in the knowledge and love of the Lord Je&s;us. None was left to vi&s;it the work-hou&s;es, where al&s;o we u&s;ed to meet with the mo&s;t moving objects of compa&s;&s;ion. Our little &s;chool, where about twenty poor children, at a time, had been taught for many years, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s on the point of be|ing broke up; there being none now, either to &s;up|port, or to attend it. And mo&s;t of tho&s;e <HI>in the town,</HI> who were once knit together, and &s;trengthened one another's hands in God, were torn a&s;under and &s;cat|tered abroad. <HI>It is time for thee, Lord, to lay to thy hand!</HI></P>
<P>At eleven, a little company of us met to intreat God, <HI>for the remnant that was left.</HI> He immediately gave us a token for good. One who had been long in the gall of bitterne&s;s, full of wrath, &s;trife and en|vy, particularly again&s;t one whom &s;he had once ten|derly loved, ro&s;e up and &s;hewed the change God had wrought in her &s;oul, by falling upon her neck, and with many tears ki&s;&s;ing her. The &s;ame &s;pirit we found reviving in others al&s;o; &s;o that we left them, not without hope, that the &s;eed which had been &s;own even here, <HI>&s;hall take root downward, and bear fruit upward.</HI></P>
<P>About &s;ix in the evening I came to Burford: and at &s;even preached to, it was judged, twelve or fifteen hundred people, on, <HI>Chri&s;t made unto us wi&s;dom, and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;anctification, and redemption.</HI> Find|ing many <HI>approved</HI> of what they had heard, that they might not <HI>re&s;t in that approbation,</HI> I explained an hour or two after the holine&s;s of a chri&s;tian: and in the morning I &s;hewed the way to this holine&s;s, by giving both the fal&s;e and the true an&s;wer to that important que&s;tion, <HI>What mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved?</HI></P>
<P>About three in the afternoon, I came to Mr. Ben|jamin Seward's, at Bengeworth, near Eve&s;ham. At
<PB N="301" REF="029861_0298_0FE2AC4412DEFA78">five I expounded in his hou&s;e (part of the xiiith chap|ter of the fir&s;t of Corinthians) and at &s;even in the &s;chool-hou&s;e, where I invited all who <HI>had nothing to pay,</HI> to come and accept of free forgivene&s;s. In the morning I preached near Mr. Seward's hou&s;e to a &s;mall, &s;erious congregation, on tho&s;e words, <HI>I came not to call the righteous, but &s;inners to repentance.</HI></P>
<P>In the evening I reached Glouce&s;ter. Sat. 6. At five in the evening I explained to about a thou&s;and people, the nature, the cau&s;e, and the condition or in&s;trument of ju&s;tification, from the&s;e words, <HI>To him that worketh not, but believeth on him that ju&s;tifieth the ungodly, his &s;aith is counted to him for righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Sand. 7. A few, I tru&s;t, out of two or three thou|&s;and, were awakened by the explanation of tho&s;e words, <HI>God hath not given unto you the &s;pirit of bondage again, to fear; but he hath given unto you the &s;pirit of adoption, wherely we cry, Abba, Father.</HI> About ele|ven I preached at Runwick, &s;even miles from Glou|ce&s;ter. The church was much crouded, though a thou&s;and or upwards &s;tayed in the church-yard. In the afternoon I explained further the &s;ame words, <HI>What mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved?</HI> I believe &s;ome thou&s;ands were then pre&s;ent, more than had been in the morning. O what a harve&s;t is here! When will it plea&s;e our Lord, to &s;end more labourers into his harve&s;t?</P>
<P>Between five and &s;ix I called on all who were pre|&s;ent (about three thou&s;and) at Stanley, on a little green near the town, to accept of Chri&s;t, as their on|ly <HI>wi&s;dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;anctification, and redemption.</HI> I was &s;trengthened to &s;peak as I never did before, and continued &s;peaking near two hours: the darkne&s;s of the night, and the little lightning not le&s;&s;ening the number, but increa&s;ing the &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of the hearers. I concluded the day by expounding part of our Lord's &s;ermon on the mount, to a &s;mall, &s;erious company at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>

Mond. 8. About eight I reached Hampton-com|mon, nine or ten miles from Glouce&s;ter. There were, it was computed, five or &s;ix thou&s;and per&s;ons. I ex|horted them all, to come unto God, as having no|thing to pay. I could gladly have &s;tayed longer with this loving people: but I was now &s;traitened for time. After &s;ermon I therefore ha&s;tened away, and in the evening came to Bri&s;tol.</P>
<P>Tue&s;. 9. My brother and I rode to Bradford. Finding there had been a general mi&s;repre&s;entation of his la&s;t &s;ermon, as if he had a&s;&s;erted reprobation therein, whereby many were greatly offended; he was con&s;trained to explain him&s;elf on that head, and to &s;hew in plain and &s;trong words, that God <HI>willeth all men to be &s;aved.</HI> Some were equally offended at this. But whether men will hear or whether they will for|bear; we may not <HI>&s;hun to declare</HI> unto them, <HI>all the coun&s;el of God.</HI></P>
<P>At our return in the evening not being permitted to meet at Weaver's hall, we met in a large room on Temple-backs, where (having gone through the &s;ermon on the mount and the epi&s;tle of St. John) I began that of St. James, that tho&s;e who had already learned the true nature of inward holine&s;s, might be more fully in&s;tructed in outward holine&s;s, without which al&s;o we cannot &s;ee the Lord.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;. 10. Finding many to be in heavine&s;s, whom I had left full of peace and joy, I exhorted them at Bapti&s;t-mills, to <HI>look unto Je&s;us, the author and fini&s;her of our faith.</HI> We poured out our com|plaint before him in the evening, and found that he was again with us of a truth. One came to us &s;oon after I was gone home, who was &s;till in grievous darkne&s;s. But we commended her cau&s;e to God, and he immediately re&s;tored the light of his coun|tenance.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="029861_0300_0FE2AC4F9029A260">
Thur&s;. 11. We were comforted by the coming in of one who was a notorious drunkard and common &s;wearer. But he is wa&s;hed, and old things are pa&s;&s;ed away. <HI>Such power belongeth unto God.</HI> In the even|ing our Lord ro&s;e on many who were wounded, <HI>with healing in his wings:</HI> and others who till then were carele&s;s and at ea&s;e, felt the two-edged &s;word that cometh out of his mouth.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e &s;hewed the agony of her &s;oul by cry|ing aloud to God for help, to the great offence of many, who eagerly <HI>rebuked her that &s;he &s;hould hold her peace.</HI> She continued in great torment all night, finding no re&s;t either of &s;oul or body. But while a few were praying for her in the morning, God deliver|ed her out of her di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Frid. 12. We had fre&s;h occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve the darkne&s;s which was fallen on many who lately rejoiced in God. But he did not long hide his face from them. On Wedne&s;day the &s;pirit of many revived: on Thur&s;|day evening many more found him in whom they had believed, to be <HI>a pre&s;ent help in time of trouble.</HI> And never do I remember the power of God to have been more eminently pre&s;ent than this morning: when a cloud of witne&s;&s;es declared his <HI>breaking the gates of bra&s;s, and &s;miting the bars of iron in &s;under.</HI></P>
<P>Yet I could not but be under &s;ome concern, with regard to one or two per&s;ons, who were tormented in an unaccountable manner, and &s;eemed to be indeed lunatic as well as <HI>&s;ore vexed.</HI> But while I was mu&s;ing, what would be the i&s;&s;ue of the&s;e things, the an&s;wer I received from the word of God was, <HI>Glory to God in the highe&s;t, and on earth peace, good-will to|wards men.</HI></P>
<P>Soon after I was &s;ent for to one of tho&s;e, who was &s;o &s;trangely torn by the devil, that I almo&s;t wondered her relations did not &s;ay, "Much religion hath made thee mad." We prayed God to brui&s;e Satan under
<PB N="304" REF="029861_0301_0FE2AC511B82D4D8">her feet. Immediately we had the petition we a&s;ked of him. She cried out vehemently, "He is gone, he is gone!" And was filled with the &s;pirit of love and of a found mind. I have &s;een her many times &s;ince, &s;trong in the Lord. When I a&s;ked abruptly, "What do you de&s;ire now?" She an&s;wered, "Heaven." I a&s;ked, "What is in your heart?" She replied, "God." I a&s;ked, "But how is your heart when any thing pro|vokes you?" She &s;aid, "By the grace of God, I am not provoked at any thing. All the things of this world pa&s;s by me as &s;hadows." <HI>Ye have &s;een the and of the Lord.</HI> Is he not very pitiful and of ten|der mercy?</P>
<P>We had a refre&s;hing meeting at one with many of our &s;ociety; who fail not to ob&s;er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e as health permits, the weekly fa&s;t of our church, and will do &s;o by God's help, as long as they call them&s;elves members of it. And would to God, all who contend for the rites and ceremonies of the church (perhaps with more zeal than meekne&s;s of wi&s;dom) would fir&s;t &s;hew their own regard for her di&s;cipline, in this more important branch of it!</P>
<P>At four I preached near the Fi&s;h-ponds (at the de|&s;ire of one who had long laboured under the apprehen|&s;ion of it) on the bla&s;phemy again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, that is, according to the plain &s;criptural account, <HI>The openly and maliciou&s;ly a&s;&s;erting, that the miracles of Chri&s;t were wrought by the power of the devil.</HI></P>
<P>Sat. 13. I was with one, who being in deep an|gui&s;h of &s;pirit, had been the day before to a&s;k a clergyman's advice. He told her, "Her head was out of order, and &s;he mu&s;t go and take phy&s;ic." In the evening we called upon God for medicine, to heal tho&s;e that were <HI>broken in heart.</HI> And five who had long been in the &s;hadow of death, <HI>knew they were pa&s;&s;ed from death unto life.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="029861_0302_0FE2AC5370CB5540">
The &s;harp fro&s;t in the morning, Sunday 14, did not prevent about 1500, from being at Hannam, to whom I called, in the words of our gracious Ma&s;ter. <HI>Come unto me, all ye that are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you re&s;t.</HI> In the evening we claimed and received the promi&s;e for &s;everal who were <HI>weary and heavy-laden.</HI></P>
<P>Mond. 15. Upon a pre&s;&s;ing invitation, &s;ome time &s;ince received, I &s;et out for Wales. About four in the afternoon, I preached on a little green, at the foot of the Devauden (a high hill, two or three miles be|yond Chep&s;tow) to three or four hundred plain people, on, <HI>Chri&s;t our wi&s;dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;anctification and redemption.</HI> After &s;ermon, one who I tru&s;t is an old di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t, willingly received us into his hou&s;e: whither many following, I &s;hewed them their need of a Saviour, from the&s;e words, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are the poor in &s;pirit.</HI> In the morning I de&s;cribed more fully the way to &s;alvation. <HI>Believe in the Lord Je&s;us, and thou &s;halt be &s;aved:</HI> and then taking leave of my friendly ho&s;t, before two came to Abergavenny.</P>
<P>I felt in my&s;elf a &s;trong aver&s;ion to preaching here. However I went to Mr. W &mdash; (the per&s;on in who&s;e ground Mr. Whitefield preached) to de&s;ire the u&s;e of it. He &s;aid. "With all his heart&mdash;if the mini&s;ter was not willing to let me have the u&s;e of the church;" after who&s;e refu&s;al (for I wrote a line to him imme|diately) he invited me to his hou&s;e.

Wedne&s;. 15. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ro&s;t was &s;harper than before. However five or &s;ix hundred people &s;tayed, while I explained the nature of that &s;alvation which is through faith, yea, faith alone: and the nature of that living faith, through which cometh this &s;alvation. About noon I came to U&s;k, where I preached to a &s;mall com|pany of poor people, on tho&s;e words, <HI>The Son of man is come, to &s;ave that which is lo&s;t.</HI> One grey-headed man wept and trembled exceedingly: and another who was there (I have &s;ince heard) as well as two or three who were at the Devauden, <HI>are gone quite di&s;tracted:</HI> that is, they mourn and refu&s;e to be comforted, till they <HI>have redemption through his blood.</HI></P>
<P>When I came to Ponty-pool in the afternoon, being unable to procure any more convenient place, I &s;tood in the &s;treet, and cried aloud to five or &s;ix hundred at|tentive hearers, To <HI>believe in the Lord Je&s;us,</HI> that they might <HI>be &s;aved.</HI> In the evening I &s;hewed his willing|ne&s;s to &s;ave all who de&s;ire to come unto God through him. Many were melted into tears. It may be, that &s;ome will <HI>bring forth fruit with patience.</HI></P>
<P>Thur&s;d. 18. I endeavoured to cut them off from all fal&s;e &s;upports and vain dependencies, by explaining and applying that fundamental truth, <HI>To him that work|eth not, but believeth on him that ju&s;tifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted to him for righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>When we were at the Devauden on Monday, a poor woman who lived &s;ix miles off, came thither in great heavine&s;s. She was deeply convinced of &s;in, and wea|ry of it; but found no way to e&s;cape from it. She walked from thence to Abergavenny on Tue&s;day, and on Wedne&s;day from Abergavenny to U&s;k. Thence in the afternoon &s;he came to Ponty-pool; where be|tween twelve and one in the morning, after a &s;harp conte&s;t in her &s;oul, our Lord got unto him&s;elf the victory: and the love of God was &s;hed abroad in her heart, te&s;tifying that her &s;ins were forgiven her. She
<PB N="307" REF="029861_0304_0FE2AC5E44105C08">went on her way rejoicing to Cardiff; whither I came in the afternoon. And about five (the mini&s;ter not being willing I &s;hould preach in the church on a week|day) I preached in the Shire-hall (a large convenient place) on <HI>Believe and thou &s;halt be &s;aved.</HI> Several were there who laboured much to make a di&s;turbance. But our Lord &s;uffered them not. At &s;even I explain|ed to a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uch more numerous audience, the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of <HI>mourning</HI> and <HI>poverty of &s;pirit.</HI> Deep attention &s;at on the faces of the hearers; many of whom, I tru&s;t, <HI>have believed our report.</HI></P>
<P>Friday 19. I preached in the morning at New|port, on <HI>What mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved?</HI> To the mo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible, ill-behaved people I have ever &s;een in Wales. One ancient man, during a great part of the &s;ermon, cur&s;ed and &s;wore almo&s;t ince&s;&s;antly: and towards the conclu&s;ion took up a great &s;tone, which he many times attempted to throw. But that he could not do. &mdash;Such the champions! Such the arms again&s;t field-preaching!</P>
<P>At four I preached at the Shire-hall of Cardiff again, where many gentry, I found were pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Such freedom of &s;peech I have &s;eldom had, as was given me in explaining tho&s;e words. <HI>The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> At &s;ix almo&s;t the whole town (I was informed) came together, to whom I explained the &s;ix la&s;t beatitudes, but my heart was &s;o enlarged, I knew not how to give over, &s;o that we continued three hours. O may the &s;eed they have received, have its fruit unto holine&s;s, and in the end, everla&s;ting life!</P>
<P>Sat. 20. I returned to Bri&s;tol. I have &s;een no part of England &s;o plea&s;ant for &s;ixty or &s;eventy miles together, as tho&s;e parts of Wales I have been in. And mo&s;t of the inhabitants are indeed <HI>ripe for the go&s;pel.</HI> I mean (if the expre&s;&s;ion appear &s;trange) they
<PB N="308" REF="029861_0305_0FE2AC5FD1E1F508">are <HI>earne&s;tly de&s;irous</HI> of being in&s;tructed in it: and as <HI>utterly ignorant</HI> of it they are, as any Creek or Chero|kee Indians. I do not mean they are ignorant of the name of Chri&s;t. Many of them can &s;ay both the Lord's prayer and the belief. Nay, and &s;ome, all the catechi&s;m: but take them out of the road of what they have learned by ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, and they know no more (nine in ten of tho&s;e with whom I conver&s;ed) either of go&s;pel &s;alvation, or of that faith, whereby alone we can be &s;aved, than Chicali or Tomo Chachi. Now, what &s;pirit is he of, who had rather the&s;e poor creatures &s;houle peri&s;h for lack of knowledge, than that they &s;hould be &s;aved, even by the exhortations of Howel Harris, or an <HI>itinerant</HI> preacher?</P>
<P>Finding a &s;lackne&s;s creeping in among them who had begun to run well, on Sunday 21, both in the morning and afternoon, I enforced tho&s;e words, <HI>As ye have received the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;o walk ye in him.</HI> In the evening I endeavoured to quicken them farther, by de&s;cribing <HI>pure and undefiled religion:</HI> and the next day, to encourage them in pur&s;uing it, by enforcing tho&s;e words of our ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter, <HI>In the world ye &s;hall have tribulation; but be of good cheer: I have overcome the world.</HI></P>
<P>Tue&s;. 23. In riding to Bradford, I read over Mr. Law's book on the new-birth: philo&s;ophical, &s;peculative, precarious; Behmeni&s;h, void and vain!
<Q>O what a fall is there!</Q>
At eleven I preached at Bearfield to about three thou|&s;and, on the nature of the &s;pirit of bondage, and of adoption.</P>
<P>Returning in the evening, I was exceedingly pre&s;&s;|ed to go back to a young woman in King&s;wood. (The fact I nakedly relate, and leave every man to his own judgment of it.) I went. She was nine|teen
<PB N="309" REF="029861_0306_0FE2AC615E034DC8">or twenty years old, but (it &s;eems) could not write or read. I found her on the bed, two or three per&s;ons holding her. It was a terrible &s;ight. An|gui&s;h, horror and de&s;pair, above all de&s;cription, ap|peared in her pale face. The thou&s;and di&s;tortions of her whole body &s;hewed, how the dogs of hell were gnawing her heart. The &s;hrieks intermixed were &s;carce to be endured. But her &s;tony eyes could not weep. She &s;creamed out, as &s;oon as words could find their way, "I am damned, damned; lo&s;t for ever. Six days ago you might have helped me. But it is pa&s;t. I am the devil's now. I have given my&s;elf to him. His I am. Him I mu&s;t &s;erve. With him I mu&s;t go to hell. I will be his. I will &s;erve him. I will go with him to hell. I cannot be &s;aved. I will not be &s;aved. I mu&s;t, I will, I will be damned." She then began praying to the devil. We began <Q>"Arm of the Lord, awake, awake!"</Q> She immediately &s;unk down as a&s;leep; but as &s;oon as we left off, broke out again, with inexpre&s;&s;ible vehemence, "Stony hearts, break! I am a warning to you. Break, break, poor, &s;tony hearts! Will you not break? What can be done more for &s;tony hearts? I am damned, that you may be &s;aved. Now break, now break poor &s;tony hearts! You need not be damned, though I mu&s;t." She then fixed her eyes on the corner of the cieling and &s;aid, "There he is, ay, there he is, Come, good devil, come. Take me away. You &s;aid, you would da&s;h my brains out. Come, do it quickly. I am your's. I will be your's. Come ju&s;t now. Take me away." We interrupted her by calling again upon God: on which &s;he &s;unk down as before: and another young woman began to roar out as loud as &s;he had done. My brother now came in, it being about nine o'clock. We continued
<PB N="310" REF="029861_0307_0FE2AC69D214B920">in prayer till pa&s;t eleven; when God in a moment &s;poke peace into the &s;oul, fir&s;t of the fir&s;t torment|ed, and then of the other. And they both joined in &s;inging prai&s;e to him, who had &s;tilled the enemy and the avenger.</P>
<P>Wed. 24. I preached at Bapti&s;t-mills on tho&s;e words of St. Paul, &s;peaking in the per&s;on of one <HI>under the law</HI> (that is, &s;till <HI>carnal, and &s;old under &s;in,</HI> though groaning for deliverance) <HI>I know that in me dwelleth no good thing.</HI> A poor woman told me after|wards, <HI>I does hope as my hu&s;band wont hinder me any more. For I minded he did &s;hiver every bone of him, and the tears ran down his cheeks like the rain.</HI> I warned our little &s;ociety in the evening, To beware of levity, &s;lackne&s;s in good works, and de&s;pi&s;ing little things; which had cau&s;ed many to fall again into bondage.</P>
<P>Thur&s;. 25. I was &s;ent for to one in Bri&s;tol, who was taken ill the evening before. (This fact too I will &s;imply relate, &s;o far as I was an ear, or eye-wit|ne&s;s of it.) She lay on the ground furiou&s;ly gna&s;h|ing her teeth, and after a while roared aloud. It was not ea&s;y for three or four per&s;ons to hold her, e&s;pecially when the name of Je&s;us was named. We prayed; the violence of her &s;ymptoms cea&s;ed, though without a complete deliverance.</P>
<P>In the evening, being &s;ent for to her again, I was un|willing, indeed afraid to go: thinking it would not avail, unle&s;s &s;ome who were &s;trong in the faith, were to wre&s;tle with God for her. I opened my te&s;tament on tho&s;e words, <HI>I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth.</HI> I &s;tood <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">proved and went imme|diately. She began &s;creaming before I came into the room; then broke out into a horrid laughter, mixed with bla&s;phemy, grievous to hear. One who from many circum&s;tances apprehended a preter-natural agent to be concerned in this, a&s;king, "How did&s;t thou dare to enter into a Chri&s;tian?" Was an&s;wered, "She is
<PB N="311" REF="029861_0308_0FE2AC6BC1039138">not a Chri&s;tian. She is mine." Q. "Do&s;t thou not tremble at the name of Je&s;us?" No words followed, but &s;he &s;hrunk back and trembled exceedingly. Q. "Art thou not increa&s;ing thy own damnation?" It was an&s;wered faintly, "Ay, ay:" which was followed by fre&s;h cur&s;ing and bla&s;pheming.</P>
<P>My brother coming in, &s;he cried out, "Preacher! Field-preacher! I do not love field-preaching." This was repeated two hours together, with &s;pitting and all the expre&s;&s;ions of &s;trong aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>We left her at twelve, but called again about noon, on Friday 27. And now it was that God &s;heweth, he heareth prayer. All her pangs cea&s;ed in a moment. She was filled with peace, and knew that the &s;on of wickedne&s;s was departed from her.</P>
<P>Saturday 28. I was &s;ent for to King&s;wood again, to one of tho&s;e who had been &s;o ill before. A violent rain began ju&s;t as I &s;et out, &s;o that I was thoroughly wet in a few minutes. Ju&s;t at that time the woman (then three miles off) cried out, "Yonder comes We&s;ley, galloping as fa&s;t as he can." When I was come, I was quite cold and dead, and fitter for &s;leep than prayer She bur&s;t out into a horrid laughter and &s;aid, "No power, no power; no faith, no faith. She is mine. Her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> is mine. I have her and will not let her go."</P>
<P>We begged of God to increa&s;e our faith. Mean while her pangs increa&s;ed more and more: &s;o that o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> would have imagined, by the violence of the throes, her body mu&s;t have been &s;hattered to pieces. One who was clearly convinced this was no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;|order, &s;aid, "I think, Satan is let loo&s;e. I fear, he will not &s;top here." And added, "I command thee, in the name of the Lord Je&s;us, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> tell if thou ha&s;t commi&s;&s;ion to torment any other &s;oul?" It was im|mediately an&s;wered, "I have. L&mdash;y C&mdash;r, and
<PB N="312" REF="029861_0309_0FE2AC6D4E2F1698">S&mdash;h J&mdash;s." (Two who lived at &s;ome di&s;tance, and were then in perfect health.)</P>
<P>We betook our&s;elves to prayer again, and cea&s;ed not, till &s;he began, about &s;ix o'clock, with a clear voice, and compo&s;ed, chearful look, <Q>"Prai&s;e God from whom all ble&s;&s;ings flow!"</Q></P>
<P>Sund. 28. I preached once more at Bradford at one in the afternoon. The violent rains did not hin|der more, I believe, than ten thou&s;and, from earne&s;tly attending to what I &s;poke on tho&s;e &s;olemn words, <HI>I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men. For I have not &s;hunned to declare unto you all the coun&s;el of God.</HI></P>
<P>Returning in the evening, I called at Mrs. J&mdash;'s in King&s;wood. S&mdash;y J&mdash;s and L&mdash;y C&mdash;v were there. It was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a quarter of an hour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be|fore L&mdash;y C&mdash;r fell into a &s;tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nge agony, and pre&s;ently after, S&mdash;y J&mdash;s. The violent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> all over their bodies, were &s;uch as words cannot de|&s;cribe. Their cries and groans were too horrid to be borne: till one of them in a tone not to be expre&s;&s;ed, &s;aid, "Where is your faith now? Come, go to pray|ers. I will pray with you. <HI>Our Father which art in heaven.</HI>" We took the advice, from whom&s;oever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> came, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> out our &s;ouls before God, till L&mdash;y C&mdash;r's agonies &s;o increa&s;ed, that it &s;eem|ed &s;he was in the pangs of death. But in a moment God &s;poke; &s;he knew his voice, and both her body and &s;oul wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> healed.</P>
<P>We continued in prayer till near one, when S&mdash; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&mdash;'s voice was al&s;o changed, and &s;he began &s;trong|ly to call upon God. This &s;he did for the greate&s;t part of the night. In the morning we renewed our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rayers, while &s;he was crying continually, "I burn, I burn; O what &s;hall I do? I have a fire within
<PB N="313" REF="029861_0310_0FE2AC6EDB1EAC38">me. I cannot bear it. Lord Je&s;us! Help!" Amen, Lord Je&s;us! When thy time is come.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;. 31. I &s;trongly enforced on tho&s;e who ima|gine they <HI>believe,</HI> and do not, <HI>As the body without the &s;pirit is dead, &s;o &s;aith without works is dead al&s;o.</HI> The power of God was in an unu&s;ual manner pre&s;ent at the meeting of the bands in the evening. Six or &s;even were deeply convinced of their unfaithfulne&s;s to God, and two filled again with his love. But poor Mary W&mdash; remained as one without hope. Her &s;oul refu&s;ed comfort. She could neither pray her&s;elf, nor bear to hear us. At la&s;t &s;he cried out, Give me the book and I will &s;ing. She began giving out line by line (but with &s;uch an accent as art could never reach.)</P>
<Q><L>"Why do the&s;e cares my &s;oul divide,</L>
<L>If thou indeed ha&s;t &s;et me free?</L>
<L>Why am I thus, if God hath dy'd,</L>
<L>If God hath dy'd to purcha&s;e me?</L>
<L>Around me clouds of darkne&s;s roll:</L>
<L>In deepe&s;t night I &s;till walk on:</L>
<L>Heavily moves my <HI>damned</HI> &s;oul&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>Here we were obliged to interrupt her; we again betook our&s;elves to prayer, and her heart was ea&s;ed, though not &s;et at liberty.</P>
<P>Thur&s;. Nov. 1. I &s;et out and the next evening came to Reading, where a little company of us met in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, at which the zealous mob was &s;o enraged, they were ready to tear the hou&s;e down. Therefore I hope God has a work to do in this place. In thy time let it be fulfilled.</P>
<P>About this time I received a letter from the author of tho&s;e reflections which I mentioned July 31. An extract of which I have &s;ubjoined.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<PB N="314" REF="029861_0311_0FE2AC7796662180">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I wrote the <HI>rules</HI> and <HI>con&s;iderations</HI> [in No. 25. of <HI>Country Common-Sen&s;e</HI>] with an eye to Mr. Whitefield, your&s;elf and your oppo&s;ers, from a &s;in|cere de&s;ire to do &s;ome &s;ervice to Chri&s;tianity, accord|ing to the <HI>imperfect</HI> notions I had at that time of the real merits of the cau&s;e: I at the &s;ame time re&s;olved, to take any opportunity that &s;hould offer for my <HI>better</HI> information.</P>
<P>On this principle it was, that I made one of your audience, Oct. 23, at Bradford. And becau&s;e I thought I could form the be&s;t judgment of you and your doctrines from your &s;ermon, I re&s;olved to hear that fir&s;t: which was the rea&s;on, that although by accident, I was at the &s;ame hou&s;e, and walked two miles with you, to the place you preached at, I &s;poke little or nothing to you. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, Sir, that the di&s;cour&s;e you made that day, wherein you pre&s;&s;ed your hearers in the clo&s;e&s;t manner, and with the autho|rity of a true mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel, not to &s;top at <HI>faith</HI> ONLY, but to add to it <HI>all virtues,</HI> and to &s;hew forth their <HI>faith,</HI> by every kind of <HI>good works,</HI> con|vinced me of the great wrong done you by a public report, common in people's mouth, that you preach <HI>faith</HI> without <HI>works.</HI> For, that is the only ground of <HI>prejudice</HI> which any true Chri&s;tian can have: and is the &s;en&s;e in which your adver&s;aries would take your words, when they cen&s;ure them. For that we are <HI>ju&s;tified</HI> by faith ONLY, is the doctrine of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the doc|trine of his apo&s;tles, and the doctrine of the church of England. I am a&s;hamed, that after having lived twenty-nine years, &s;ince my <HI>bapti&s;m</HI> into this faith, I &s;hould &s;peak of it in the lame, unfaithful, I may &s;ay, <HI>fal&s;e</HI> manner I have done in the paper above-men|tioned! What mere <HI>darkne&s;s</HI> is man, when truth bideth her face from him!</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="029861_0312_0FE2AC799AE0D048">
Man is by nature a <HI>&s;inner,</HI> the child of the <HI>devil,</HI> under God's <HI>wrath,</HI> in a flate of <HI>damnation.</HI> The Son of God took pity on this our mi&s;ery: he made him&s;elf <HI>man,</HI> he made him&s;elf <HI>&s;in</HI> for us; that is, he hath borne the <HI>puni&s;hment</HI> of our &s;in, the cha&s;ti&s;ement of <HI>our</HI> peace was upon him, and by his &s;tripes we are healed. To receive this boundle&s;s mercy, this in|e&s;timable benefit, we mu&s;t have faith in our Benefac|tor, and through him in God.&mdash;But then, true faith is not a lifele&s;s principle, as your adver&s;aries &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, to under&s;tand it. They and you mean quite another thing by <HI>&s;aith.</HI> They mean, A bare believing, that Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t. You mean a living, growing, purifying principle, which is the root both of inward and outward holine&s;s; both of <HI>purity</HI> and <HI>good works:</HI> without which no man can have faith, at lea&s;t no other than a dead faith.</P>
<P>This, Sir, you explained in your &s;ermon at Brad|ford, Sund. Oct. 28, to near ten thou&s;and people, who all &s;tood to h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> you, with awful &s;ilence and great attention. I have &s;ince reflected, how much good the clergy might do, if in&s;tead of <HI>&s;hunning,</HI> they would come to hear and conver&s;e with you; and in their churches and pari&s;hes, would farther en|force tho&s;e <HI>catholic doctrines</HI> which you preach: and which I am glad to &s;ee have &s;uch a &s;urpri&s;ing <HI>good ef|fect,</HI> on great numbers of &s;ouls.</P>
<P>I think indeed, too many clergymen are culpable, in that they do not inform them&s;elves better, of Mr. Whitefield, your&s;elf and your doctrines, from your own mouth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">: I am per&s;uaded, if they did this with a Chri&s;tian &s;pirit, the differences between you would &s;oon be at an end. Nay, I think, tho&s;e who&s;e <HI>flocke</HI> re&s;ort &s;o much to hear you, ought to do it, out of their <HI>pa&s;toral duty</HI> to them: that if you preach <HI>good doctrine.</HI> they may edify them, on the impre&s;&s;ions &s;o
<PB N="316" REF="029861_0313_0FE2AC7B2978A748">vi&s;ibly made by your &s;ermons, or if <HI>evil,</HI> they may reclaim them from error.&mdash;</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this letter with putting you in mind, in all your &s;ermons, writings and practice, <HI>nakedly</HI> to follow the <HI>naked</HI> Je&s;us: I mean, to preach the <HI>pure doctrine</HI> of the go&s;pel without re&s;pect of per&s;ons or things. Many <HI>preachers,</HI> many <HI>reformers,</HI> many <HI>mi&s;|&s;ionaries,</HI> have fallen by not ob&s;erving this; by not having continually in mind, <HI>Whoever &s;hall break the lea&s;t of the&s;e commandments, and teach men &s;o, he &s;hall be called the lea&s;t in the kingdom of heaven.</HI></P>
