<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>POSTERITY, if not the pre&s;ent age, will view the revolution of the United States as an event the mo&s;t &s;ingular and extraordinary that ever occurred in the annals of human tran&s;actions. Whether we view it as data, from which the emancipation of Europe may be argued, or limit its benignity by the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi and the St. Laurence, &s;till it is important. In this, without ad|verting to the beneficial effects it has produced to every inhabitant on this Continent, it is an unan&s;werable con|futation of pe&s;tilent doctrines of the advocates of de&s;|potic power, from the days of Sir Robert Filmer, to tho&s;e of Edmund Burke, viz. That Repre&s;entative Go|vernment, &s;uch as ours is, can have no being but in the imagination, and con&s;equently is impracticable. In that, tho' the progre&s;s may be &s;low, and the concu&s;&s;ions in&s;eperable from va&s;t revolutions, great and numerous, yet the event is certain, viz. that Europe will, eventu|ally, overthrow its pre&s;ent iniquitous Governments, and in&s;titute polities more con&s;onant with ju&s;tice and the &s;olid happine&s;s of man. The imperi&s;hable &s;entiment is gone forth, and the &s;alutary work mu&s;t be completed. The germ was indeed fir&s;t planted in the United States, but its branches &s;hall inwrap the globe. Re&s;i&s;tance to ty|ranny has taken an everla&s;ting root in the human mind, and that cau&s;e which produced the revolution of the United States, will give to Europe a double impul&s;e, becau&s;e doubly oppre&s;&s;ed. Of this oppre&s;&s;ion, and the obduracy of their oppre&s;&s;ors, Europeans are &s;en&s;ible, and manife&s;t an invincible de&s;ire to redre&s;s their own wrongs. This mode is efficient; every other ineffec|tual; for de&s;poti&s;m will concede that only which, for want of armed power, it cannot retain.</P>
<P>The grand &s;entiment of our revolution is happily re|corded in the declaration of independence. In it we behold an inimitable depiction of the &s;entiments of a nation &s;en&s;ible of its wrongs, and ri&s;ing, in the impre&s;|&s;ive attitude of a people animated by one common &s;en|timent
<PB N="vi" REF="037171_0004_100D8C5C76136A10">
to a&s;&s;ert its rights. This declaration contains, among&s;t others equally excellent, the following words, "We hold the&s;e truths to be &s;elf-evident, that all men are created equal." It was worthy the &s;age and patri|otic a&s;&s;embly to recognize and incorporate in this its fir&s;t act of legi&s;lation, a &s;entiment &s;o correct and ju&s;t that no argument, at no period, has been able to effect. And what is the induction from this the&s;is? That as all men are created equal, and as Governments are in&s;tituted by men for their mutual &s;afety and comfort, it follows, that the right of all, to in&s;titute, is equal. So far the political equality of man extends, which is to the utmo&s;t limits, and &s;o far the po&s;ition has been &s;anctified by the wi&s;e&s;t a&s;&s;embly the world ever knew.</P>
<P>This dogma, the foundation of our Government, though not perfect and in full force throughout the fede|ral compact, yet it <HI>approaches nearer to perfection than any other Government hitherto known.</HI> We wi&s;h we could here &s;ay that this perfectability, like the ubiquity of God, extended it&s;elf to every political in&s;titution within our land. But that adherence to truth, of which we are tenacious, compels us to ob&s;erve, that this principle was not univer&s;ally infu&s;ed into our &s;tate polities at the aera of the revolution. Every &s;tate exhibits in material points different and repugnant polities, and &s;ome of them &s;trange contraventions of the original &s;entiment. We regret this want of uniformity, &s;ince we fear, that unle&s;s the ju&s;t principle of equal repre&s;entation do pre|vail in every &s;tate government, the republicani&s;m of this country, pre&s;&s;ed on all &s;ides by &s;o many deadly foes, mu&s;t ultimately fall a &s;acrifice to their in&s;iduous arts.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, &s;uch is the nature of civil compacts, that the people have at all times an unalienable right to make &s;uch alterations as to them may appear nece&s;&s;ary. In all &s;uch ca&s;es nothing more is nece&s;&s;ary than to know that evils exi&s;t; to a&s;certain the cau&s;es from which they &s;pring; and to apply remedies commen&s;urate therewith. For as in other matters, &s;o in politics, experience will be&s;t teach us the excellence of our in&s;titutions. Hence
<PB N="vii" REF="037171_0005_100D8C5E47DD61C8">
the rea&s;onablene&s;s of this po&s;tulate, that it is a right in|herent in the people to make &s;uch alterations in their political &s;y&s;tems as experience, the foundation of our knowledge, &s;hall have demon&s;trated to be nece&s;&s;ary. The great object of civil polities is happine&s;s; and hap|pine&s;s being the de&s;ire of all men, it follows, that they have a right at all times to make choice of that &s;y&s;tem which appears be&s;t calculated to produce the end.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAPT. I.</HI> Of Political Equality.</HEAD>
<P>COMPARATIVELY, &s;ociety is in political &s;cience, what infants are re&s;pecting knowledge, in a &s;tate of ig|norance. Notwith&s;tanding the laborious re&s;earches of ancient and modern politicians; notwith&s;tanding the rapid and colo&s;&s;ian advances made in the United States in this branch of human knowledge, the world has not, even at this late period, di&s;covered one &s;ingle princi|ple which, like the lemmas in mathematics, may be laid down as incontrovertible. And yet until this be done until the rights of man &s;hall be demon&s;trated like the propo&s;itions of Euclid, and the generality of mankind be made acquainted therewith, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of liberty, even when once e&s;tabli&s;hed, cannot be &s;ecure! We are deficient in the developement of fundamental principles, &s;ufficiently clear and undoubted. And yet it is nece&s;|&s;ary to have unerring &s;tandards by a collation with which we might determine, when the proceedings of legi&s;la|tures are in uni&s;on therewith and promotive of the gene|ral weal. Until we arrive at this &s;tage of political &s;ci|ence and make mankind acquainted with its principles, the wars, the u&s;urpations, the tyrannies, the di&s;&s;onance, and the bickerings which de&s;troy the life and &s;olace of man, will not cea&s;e to exi&s;t: tho' we &s;hall find, as indeed we now do, that in proportion as we advance in the knowledge of this mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary &s;cience, and that knowledge becomes general, the condition of man will be meliorated.</P>
<P>The principle of equality will lead us to this ultimate point. It is on this principle <HI>alone</HI> that the liberty of
<PB N="10" REF="037171_0007_100D8C630DB12080">
man is founded; and this is the criterion whereby we may determine, with con&s;iderable preci&s;ion, the degree of liberty exi&s;tent in &s;tates. If the &s;cience of govern|ment ever be reduced to clear and determinate rules, it will be through the medium of political equality. For we invariably find that governments become de&s;potic in the ratio that con&s;tituent power dimini&s;hes; or in other words, in proportion as governments become independent of the controul of the people, the people become the &s;laves of governments.</P>
<P>On the other hand, in proportion as the people po&s;&s;e&s;s the controuling power of the &s;tate according to a known and mutually e&s;tabli&s;hed rule, they will be politically happy. For as man never wills that <HI>knowingly,</HI> which tends to de&s;troy his happine&s;s, &s;o he will never will the exi&s;tence of laws which will le&s;&s;en his felicity. If the beatification of man depended upon him&s;elf, and its at|tainment was within his own gra&s;p, his felicity would be complete, &s;ince he would never will its attenuation. If this rea&s;oning holds good individually con&s;idered, it is not le&s;s &s;o with re&s;pect to nations, which are compo&s;ed of individuals. Therefore a government who&s;e body &s;hall be animated by the &s;entiment of the people, and its actions dictated by their will, will not, <HI>knowingly,</HI> do that which will le&s;&s;en the happine&s;s of the whole. If &s;uch a government &s;hould ever err, it would be from want of <HI>knowledge</HI> (which is not probable) not from <HI>de&s;ign.</HI> It is the difference of the being of equality which con&s;titutes the difference between the political &s;tate of the people of Ru&s;&s;ia and tho&s;e of the United States. The former, &s;laves of the mo&s;t abject condition, have no more power to controul or influence the govern|ment of Ru&s;&s;ia than they have to controul or influence our own. Why? Becau&s;e tho&s;e who admini&s;ter that govern|ment do not depend upon the people for their offices: be|cau&s;e they are not amenable to the people for their con|duct. The people therefore are of no farther con&s;idera|tion in the &s;tate, than as &s;ubjects of the taxation &amp; in&s;tru|ments to operate the will of government. As if ordained by God, they live and labour only to conduce to the hap|pine&s;s of their tyrants, and to nouri&s;h the mercile&s;s
<PB N="11" REF="037171_0008_100D8C651C337F68">
hand that &s;mites them. In the United States, tho' po|litical equality is not as perfect as it might be, yet every man feels and maintains the dignity of his &s;tation. The government is <HI>really</HI> the government of the people. It was they who modelled the body and breathed into it the breath of life. If it &s;hould an&s;wer not the end de&s;ign|ed, they have the &s;ame right to amend that they had origin|ally to in&s;titute it. Such is the difference between the political &s;tate of the two countries.</P>
<P>And what is the cau&s;e that has produced this differ|ence? A want of the e&s;tabli&s;hment of political equality, together with a want of knowledge of its importance, &s;ufficiently exten&s;ive and correct to continue its being. The&s;e are in&s;eparable companions in a national view, both in their progre&s;s and declen&s;ion. We cannot at|tribute the political &s;uperiority of the people of the United States over tho&s;e of Ru&s;&s;ia to any other cau&s;e than their &s;uperior weight and importance in the &s;tate. Take away the weight and importance of the citizens of the&s;e &s;tates from their government; make the government as independant of the controul of the citizens as that of Ru&s;&s;ia, &amp; it will become a vortex that will ab&s;orb the earn|ings and the happine&s;s of the country; and the people, no longer the free and enlightened citizens of America, will become the &s;laves of its plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Such is the nature and importance of political equa|lity, that where it is not, the people, governed by a few men who by various means have u&s;urped the powers of the &s;tate, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be va&s;&s;als. If the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of this principle in ancient Rome, had been as univer&s;al as it is univer&s;ally ju&s;t; the dagger of Brutus, to rid the world of a tyrant, would have been unnece&s;|&s;ary. To us who enjoy an equality in the &s;tate unknown in other countries; it would be difficult to conceive the po&s;&s;ibility of a man, however tran&s;cendent his talents and vicious his heart, to become a &s;econd Cae&s;ar; and &s;o very improbable is &s;uch a ca&s;e, that the citizens, &s;ecure in the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their importance in the commonwealth, never dream of &s;uch an event. The whole&s;ome equality of the &s;tate, and the con&s;equent de|fu&s;ion
<PB N="12" REF="037171_0009_100D8C66F9D24AB8">
of political knowledge, are the be&s;t &s;afe-guards of the liberty of the people, and alone competent to curb the ambition and repre&s;s the attempts of the de&s;igning.</P>
<P>The law of equality is the law of God: and as its great author is immutable and eternal, &s;o is this primeval principle. Nor is it likely that revolutions will cea&s;e until its e&s;tabli&s;hment be as univer&s;al as man. What is it that has propelled the government of England to the precipice on which it now &s;tands? The want of this equality, which like the repul&s;ive power in the natural world, confines governments within their own bounds. Give us that weight in our national council to which by nature we are entitled; give us univer&s;al &s;uffrage, is the exclamation of every hone&s;t, thinking man, from the two extremes to the centre of the kingdom. And if this equality had prevailed in the &s;tate a century back, is it pre&s;umable that the people would have been plunged into &s;o many ruinous wars as they have been during that period? tho&s;e who think &s;o will do well di&s;pa&s;&s;ionately to examine the proceedings of the hou&s;e of repre&s;enta|tives of the United States in the pre&s;ent conte&s;t with France. The wi&s;e and manly conduct di&s;played by this branch of the government is an effect; of what? of the controuling power of the people operating upon its proceedings. Suppo&s;e for a moment the Pre&s;ident of the United States inve&s;ted with the prerogative of declar|ing war, like the King of England; and the Hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, the con&s;ervatory of the republic, as much under his controul as the Hou&s;e of Commons in England is under that of the Mini&s;ter; is it not probable that war would long ago have been declared? Tho&s;e who have attentively ob&s;erved the conduct of the executive; who have read his communications to the two hou&s;es; his addre&s;&s;es to the addre&s;&s;ors, and judiciou&s;ly con&s;ider|ed the &s;pirit of enmity manife&s;ted throughout, will hardly an&s;wer in the negative. At any rate, of this no man will doubt, that the United States have had as much cau&s;e to declare war again&s;t France as England had to com|menace the pre&s;ent one: and yet in the former ca&s;e war has not been declared, but in the latter it has; and that
<PB N="13" REF="037171_0010_100D8C68B34179A8">
too, notwith&s;tanding the decided aver&s;ion manife&s;ted thereto by a very large proportion of the people. They clearly fore&s;aw and predicted that no good could re&s;ult from &s;uch a mea&s;ure: and their predictions have been verified. But they were dragged into it by a govern|ment over which they had no influence, and who&s;e power they could not controul but by open and active re&s;i&s;tance. To what cau&s;e then &s;hall we a&s;cribe this difference but to the influence the people have over their government on the one hand, and the want of that in|fluence on the other? and what gives this influence but the equality e&s;tabli&s;hed in the republic? Nothing. Here then we have a remarkable in&s;tance of the differ|ence between a government created and e&s;&s;entially moved <HI>by</HI> the people, and one e&s;tabli&s;hed <HI>over</HI> them. The proceedings of the former are regulated by wi&s;dom and an ardent &s;olicitude to promote the general good: tho&s;e of the latter by an in&s;atiable de&s;ire to enrich the few concerned in wielding the hidious machine by the general wreck of every thing valuable to man.</P>
<P>Such is the operating force of this principle, and &s;o well is it under&s;tood in practice by the ill-di&s;po&s;ed of every country, who have gained power in &s;tates, that arbitrary government cannot be e&s;tabli&s;hed without cir|cum&s;cribing con&s;tituent power<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whatever were the motives of those who dictated and passed the present naturalization act, it tends to this point in a given ratio. Con|stituent power has not increased with the increase of population: yet the mutual increase of these two, is the life and soul of representative govern|ment.</NOTE>. In this they are cor|rect. Con&s;tituent power cannot be wre&s;ted from the people without proportionately endangering their liberty. The equality of man, the rightful foundation of legiti|mate governments cannot be abridged without a propor|tionable abridgment of public liberty. If, for example, our repre&s;entatives are dependent upon their con&s;tituents for offices in the &s;tate, it nece&s;&s;arily follows, that in pro|portion as con&s;tituent power decrea&s;es, their indepen|dence, or di&s;regard of the intere&s;ts of the people, in|crea&s;e. By the &s;ame unerring rule the dependence of
<PB N="14" REF="037171_0011_100D8C6B36578790">
our repre&s;entatives increa&s;e with the increa&s;e of con&s;titu|ent power. Of cour&s;e, in the degree that this power prevails in &s;tates, the will of the people will prevail in the governments.</P>
<P>Whether the effects herein mentioned have, or not, re&s;ulted from the principle laid down, every man will determine for him&s;elf. But of this no one will doubt who has in the lea&s;t examined into men and mea&s;ures; that in tho&s;e countries where the people have the lea&s;t power, governments are the mo&s;t de&s;potic, and the peo|ple the lea&s;t happy: as in England, the continent of Europe, and in oriental countries. It is therefore the bu&s;ine&s;s of the politician to explore and exhibit the cau&s;e. And here I think it is; the people of the United States are, beyond all doubt, more politically happy than any people of which we have knowledge; and that too I am convinced, becau&s;e a greater equa|lity prevails in the republic.</P>
<P>Hitherto we have written only of the effects in order to clear the way to examine and exhibit more per&s;picu|ou&s;ly the nature and extent of the equality of man. This &s;ubject has claimed the attention of the able&s;t wri|ters. Such indeed was the opinion of Mr. Locke con|cerning the equality of man, that he makes it the foun|dation of all the freedom and felicity that man can enjoy. In his chapter "of the &s;tate of nature" he ob&s;erves,</P>
<P>"A <HI>&s;tate</HI> of <HI>equality,</HI> wherein all the power and juri&s;|diction is reciprocal, no one having more than another: there being nothing more evident than that creatures of the &s;ame rank&punc; promi&s;cuou&s;ly born to all the &s;ame advan|tages of nature, and the u&s;e of the &s;ame faculties, &s;hould al&s;o be equal one among&s;t another, without &s;ubordina|tion or &s;ubjection, unle&s;s the Lord and ma&s;ter of them all &s;hould, by any manife&s;t declaration of his will, &s;et one above another, and confer on him, by an evident and clear appointment, an undoubted right to dominion and &s;overeignty."</P>
<P>"This <HI>equality</HI> of man by nature, the judicious <HI>Hooker</HI> looks upon as &s;o evident in it&s;elf and beyond all que&s;|tion, that he makes it the foundation of that obligation
<PB N="15" REF="037171_0012_100D8C6CCDECB280">
to mutual love among&s;t men, on which he builds the du|ties they owe one another, and from which he derives the great maxims of <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>charity.</HI> His words are."</P>
<P>"The like natural inducements hath brought men to know that it is no le&s;s their duty to love others than them&s;elves; for &s;eeing tho&s;e things which are equal mu&s;t needs all have one mea&s;ure, if I cannot but wi&s;h to receive good, even as much at every man's hands, as every man can wi&s;h even to his own &s;oul, how &s;hould I look to have any part of my de&s;ire herein &s;atisfied, un|le&s;s my&s;elf be careful to &s;atisfy the like de&s;ire which is undoubtedly in other men being of one and the &s;ame nature? To have any thing offered to them repugnant to this de&s;ire, mu&s;t needs in all re&s;pects grieve them as much as me; &s;o that if I do harm, I mu&s;t look to &s;uffer; there being no rea&s;on that others &s;hould &s;hew greater mea&s;ure of love to me, than they have by me &s;hewed unto them; my de&s;ire therefore to be loved of my equals in nature, as much as po&s;&s;ible may be, impo&s;eth upon me a natural duty of bearing to them-ward fully the like affection; from which relation of equality be|tween our&s;elves and them that are as our&s;elves, what &s;everal rules and canons natural rea&s;on has drawn for direction of life no man is ignorant." Locke on Gov. p. 177-8. &sect; 4. 5. Lon. E. 1772.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the &s;ound arguments of the&s;e celebrated authors, of numberle&s;s others before and &s;ince their days, and what is, we think, of much greater force, the practical a&s;&s;ertion of this equality in the United States, we &s;till &s;ee its authenticity que&s;tioned and even denied. And indeed &s;o we do truths the mo&s;t obvi|ous by men who&s;e de&s;ires and propen&s;ities are vicious, &amp; by tho&s;e who&s;e erroneous judgments re&s;i&s;tle&s;sly lead them into involuntary error. We &s;hall neverthele&s;s enquire into the being and nature of political equality, and endeavour to &s;hew that governments not founded upon this princi|ple, in its amplitude, are unju&s;t, and that too exactly in proportion that the practice is an aberration from the principle.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="037171_0013_100D8C6FF8BCA880">The pre&s;ent condition of &s;ociety, even in the be&s;t regu|lated &s;tates, affords no exact &s;tandard to a&s;certain the truth or fal&s;ehood of political equality. To determine this point &s;atisfactorily, and to fix it on permanent ground, we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to &s;omething anterior to cu&s;tom. For if we make cu&s;tom the touch&s;tone of the problem, we &s;hall find that it is incapable of furni&s;hing ground for &s;atisfactory &s;olution. Cu&s;tom e&s;tabli&s;hes nothing with re&s;pect to rights; &s;ince, univer&s;ally con&s;idered, it is in|capable of furni&s;hing matter out of which a propo&s;ition may be made that &s;hall be univer&s;ally true. For example, inequality obtains mo&s;t in governmental regulations; but yet it does not univer&s;ally obtain. Therefore we cannot make inequality an univer&s;al propo&s;ition in the &s;cience of government. We have a living and potent exception in the popular branch of our own govern|ment which de&s;troys the univer&s;ality of the po&s;tulate. This rea&s;oning will al&s;o apply with equal force again&s;t the being of equality in <HI>practice;</HI> &s;ince we have numer|ous in&s;tances of governments founded indeed upon the de&s;poti&s;m of a &s;ingle individual, which de&s;troys <HI>practical</HI> equality as an ubiquitous propo&s;ition. Cu&s;tom therefore furni&s;hes no rule capable of affecting the &s;ubject one way or other. When two cu&s;toms therefore prevail diametri|cally oppo&s;ite, how &s;hall we determine the truth of either? By recurring to principles of being antecedent to both.</P>
<P>To do this we mu&s;t dive&s;t our&s;elves as much as po&s;&s;ible of the ideas that habit has excited and fixed in the mind, and view the &s;ubject apart from the prevailing practices of men. We mu&s;t trace and endeavour to di&s;cover the principle by which civil &s;ociety mu&s;t be regulated if ju&s;tly con&s;tructed: and in&s;tead of permitting the forms &amp; prac|tices of government &s;o to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mind as wholly to obliterate even the remembrance of fir&s;t prin|ciples; &s;uffer un&s;hackled rea&s;on to glance into the illi|mitable field of nature, and to contemplate principles, of nature unchangeable, in their pure and unadulterated &s;tate. For the principle of civil government, like that by which a clock is regulated, has &s;eparate being from he machine; &s;o that notwith&s;tanding the machinery
<PB N="17" REF="037171_0014_100D8C725A693718">
may be imperfect, yet the imperfection <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> not the principle by which it ought to be regulated.</P>
<P>To under&s;tand then the nature of political equali|ty we mu&s;t advert to the condition of man in a &s;tate of na|ture, i. e. antecedent to the formation of civil cove|nants. We &s;hall then be able clearly to perceive the on|ly equitable mode in which civil governments can be con&s;tructed.</P>
<P>But it has been a&s;&s;erted that there never was a period when men lived together without civil law, and thence inferred, that that &s;tate of nature mentioned by various authors is a mere chimera. It may therefore be nece&s;|&s;ary to refute this erroneous hypothe&s;is in order to clear the way for the admi&s;&s;ion of the doctrine of equality. This we &s;hall do in a two-fold manner:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Theoretically; and</P>
<P>Second, By the aduction of a practical example of men living together in a &s;tate of nature; i. e. without laws to govern them, and actually and mutually making covenants for them&s;elves as if laws had never been.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. We think it &s;ucceptible of exact demon&s;tration that there has been a time when men lived together <HI>to|tally</HI> without human laws. The very exi&s;tence of laws proves that there mu&s;t have been a period whether known or not to our&s;elves, when no law or rule of action made by men did exi&s;t. For example, when we &s;ee fleets built and towns erected, what are we to conclude but that they are the productions of men who&s;e being mu&s;t have been prior to our own? In the &s;ame manner the being of human law is an effect: of what? Of the being of man antecedent to that of law. Law being made by man, if man had not exi&s;ted law would not have been. The exi&s;tence of law demon&s;trates the previous exi&s;tence of man, from whom they &s;pring; in the &s;ame manner that the being of human intelligence <NOTE N="b." PLACE="foot">See Locke on understanding vol. <HI>2.</HI> p. <HI>192.</HI> Lon. Ed. <HI>1793.</HI></NOTE> demon&s;trates the pre-exi&s;tence of God the great cau&s;e of every thing that is.

<P>Fir&s;t, that when Mr. Robin&s;on and his co-exiles ar|rived at the coa&s;t of America, they found them&s;elves in an <HI>absolute state of nature,</HI> i. e. a body of men about to
<PB N="21" REF="037171_0018_100D8C79F04A2308">
enter upon and to cultivate an unknown land, totally without law to govern them. But as they were likely to continue in a gregarious &s;tate, it was nece&s;&s;ary, for the furtherance of the ends for which governments are in|&s;tituted, that they &s;hould enter into that "&s;olemn cove|nant." Here then was the beginning of that body poli|tic, and though its component parts were but few, yet if the principle on which they proceeded be ju&s;t, it will apply with equal force and preci&s;ion to indifinite num|bers. That compact, like every other, mu&s;t, in its ope|ration affect every one within its jurisdiction; and as all were to be affected by it, it belonged to all to have an equal &s;hare in its conformation. Accordingly we find that <HI>every adult</HI> was not only pre&s;ent at its making and his pre&s;ence con&s;idered nece&s;&s;ary to its legitemacy, but that they all &s;igned the agreement. The latter is con&s;i|dered as a circum&s;tance peculiar to the ca&s;e, but the for|mer as a right that can never be impaired <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot"><P>We might multiply instances of men being in a state of nature, un|til the reader would be weary. We shall just mention another. Vattel, in his law of nations, has this passage.</P>
<P>"Nations being composed of men naturally free and independent, and who, before the establishment of civil societies, lived together in the state of nature, nations, or soverign states, are to be considered as so many free persons living together in the state of nature." P. <HI>49.</HI> New-York E. <HI>1796.</HI></P>
<P>Nations are, therefore, in relation to each other, what men are before they enter into civil society, in a state of perfect freedom and equality. Governments, considered with each other, defend, with great pertinacity, this natural freedom and equality. But they are seldom willing to allow freedom and equality to belong to those whom they govern.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>We are then got &s;o far. We find that a &s;tate of na|ture has a real being, and that however men may abu&s;e
<PB N="22" REF="037171_0019_100D8C7C332E3410">
tho&s;e rights which flow from that &s;tate, yet the abu&s;e neither affects the ab&s;tract principle nor weakens the claim of man to its full fruition. In what then does this equality con&s;i&s;t for which even in a &s;tate of nature, we contend? Not in bodily &s;trength or &s;ymmetry; not in men|tal capacity or the acquirement of knowledge, for in the&s;e we &s;ee no univer&s;al equality; <HI>but in the equal right which every man has, when at years of discretion, in the affairs of that government, instituted by and for the benefit of that &s;ociety of which he is a component part.</HI></P>
<P>A &s;tate of nature is a &s;tate of perfect freedom and equality; and as it is a &s;tate of freedom and equality &s;o it is a &s;tate of peril and in&s;ecurity. Good government is alone competent to correct the evils to which every man is expo&s;ed in a &s;tate of nature. For where there is no law common to all, individual rea&s;on is the only mea|&s;ure of men's actions which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily render the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of life, and liberty, and property, extremely uncertain. Nor could real offences, in &s;uch a &s;tate, be puni&s;hed. For where is the authoritative tribunal to de|termine the magnitude of offences and the puni&s;hment due thereto? There is none. And as there is no com|mon &s;tandard to determine, &s;o there is no power to re|tribute offences but &s;uch as re&s;ide in individuals. It is to &s;often the&s;e a&s;perities of nature that men unite in civil &s;ociety, that they agree to rules of action that &s;hall apply to tho&s;e covenanted, and to lodge the power of pu|ni&s;hing offences again&s;t the common weal, in the hands of the body politic. To transfer this power, <HI>partially,</HI> to judge and to puni&s;h from individuals, in whom it originally re&s;ided, to the whole &s;ociety, is a principal end of go|vernment. For (all things con&s;idered) a &s;tate of nature would be preferable to that of the civil &s;tate, if in it men could be &s;ecure from tho&s;e injuries of which the civil &s;tate takes cognizance. But as they cannot, and as it is nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;afety of mankind that crimes &s;hould not go unpuni&s;hed, civil government founded upon uni|ver&s;al ju&s;tice, is the proper and only corrective.</P>
<P>The great end of government is &s;ecurity. This in|cludes the protection of life, liberty, and property. Men can have no other motive for uniting in civil &s;ocie|ty
<PB N="23" REF="037171_0020_100D8C7DC9ECC580">
than the attainment of the&s;e primary objects. This protection can only be effected by placing the power to judge of and to puni&s;h offences <HI>&s;omewhere.</HI> For no me|thod hath yet been devi&s;ed, and perhaps never will be, calculated to render men incapable of perpetrating of|fences. All that &s;ociety can do, even in its be&s;t &s;tate, is to puni&s;h tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion according to its degree of tur|pitude. Governmental example and whole&s;ome laws may do much, but they cannot make bad men good. Puni&s;hing the offences of &s;ome, and forbidding, general|ly, the commi&s;&s;ion of certain acts under pains and penal|ties, are the great means of protecting the whole. Legi&s;la|tive, executive, and judiciary powers, are all founded upon the rea&s;onable pre&s;umption that offences again&s;t the well being of &s;ociety will be committed, and the ne|ce&s;&s;ity, for the end of general protection, that provi&s;ion &s;hould be made for their rightful punition. There are, doubtle&s;s, other objects which come properly within the province of internal legi&s;lation. But <HI>protection</HI> is the mighty one and <HI>puni&s;hment</HI> the great mean to accompli&s;h it. And however multiform the means employed may be, yet the end is eternally and identically the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Such are the great points to be attained by men quit|ting the &s;tate of nature and individually &s;ubmitting their actions to be judged by one common &s;tandard erected by mutual con&s;ent and for reciprocal advantage.</P>
<P>And here we &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew the nature of political equality, which we conceive &s;usceptible of &s;uch clear demon&s;tration that if we fail in demon&s;trating the reasonablene&s;s and univer&s;ality of the principle, the fault will be our own.</P>
<P>Suppose a given number of men, &s;ay one thou&s;and, living together in the &s;tate of nature, &s;trangers to law, but, con&s;cious of its importance, mutually coalescing to in&s;titute rules by which the whole &s;hall be goverened. Now it is obvious that, if the principle that will apply to one thou&s;and be ju&s;t, it will not be le&s;s &s;o when appli|ed to one million, or one hundred millions. The prin|ciple and its operation will be precisely the &s;ame, and to apply it to any number it is only nece&s;&s;ary to extend
<PB N="24" REF="037171_0021_100D8C805D42B130">
the idea as the numbers increa&s;e. Previous to entering into this pact they mu&s;t all needs be equal, that is, no one could po&s;&s;e&s;s more privileges than another. Corrupt es|tabli&s;hments only have created political di&s;tinctions in con&s;tituent rights. For in a &s;tate of nature, in which there is no law, there cannot be privileged &s;uperiors; and where there is no privileged &s;uperiors fictitiou&s;ly cre|ated, the indubitable equality of men, &s;tanding upon the broad ground upon which God hath placed them cannot be denied. The chief object to be attained by commu|ting the &s;tate of nature for that of civil &s;ociety is protec|tion. Now protection is equally due to all concerned. To whom then does the right of making this compact belong that &s;hall effect the lives, and liberty, and pro|perty of the whole? clearly, if of &s;ane mind and mature age, to every one of the number covenanting, who&s;e ev|ery thing will be affected thereby. If one half, for in|&s;tance, &s;hould a&s;&s;ert that they have the exclu&s;ive right to make a compact for the other, whence did they derive that right which does not belong to the whole? no one can tell. It is clear they could have no &s;uch right. If the right belong to any, then by this undoubted axiom "It is impo&s;&s;ible for a thing to be and not to be at the &s;ame time;" it is impo&s;&s;ible the right can belong to one without belonging to the whole. "Things which are equal to the &s;ame are equal to one another." <NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">Simeon's Euclid, p. <HI>5.</HI></NOTE> There|fore, men being equal, if the right to in&s;titute belong to one man it equally belongs to another: It cannot belong to a part without belonging to the whole. Again, "The whole is greater than its parts." <NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">Idom. p. <HI>6.</HI></NOTE> But the parts mu&s;t forever retain the properties and qualities of the whole in the ratio of their quantity of matter. So it is with a Government. The right to begin, to erect, and con|tinue a Government belongs &s;olely to the community or whole for which it is intended. Divide that community into the &s;malle&s;t po&s;&s;ible number, &s;ay one, and by parity of rea&s;oning it will be found that as the right appertains to the whole, &s;o in equal proportions, it appertains to
<PB N="25" REF="037171_0022_100D8C81F0E453B0">
to its parts: and con&s;equently, if the right belongs to one man, it equally belongs to another.</P>
<P>Such is the e&s;&s;ence, the foundation, and &s;uch our ideas of political equality. And &s;o earne&s;tly do we wi&s;h to be right in this matter; and &s;o thoroughly are we convinced that the principle here laid down is correct, that &s;hould we be herein mi&s;taken we de&s;ire to be corrected by <HI>argu|ment:</HI> And we &s;hall e&s;teem our&s;elves favored by any one who will point out the error.</P>
<P>Now as it would be palpably unju&s;t and an act of great violence for one half of the number mentioned to de|prive the other of their right of &s;uffrage in the conforma|tion of the original compact, &s;o it would be proportion|ately unju&s;t in any other given number. If ninety nine hundredths &s;hould combine to deprive the hundredth per&s;on of his right of elective franchi&s;e, tho' the crime would differ in degree of turpitude, it would neverthele&s;s be of the &s;ame kind. This nece&s;&s;arily follows from the principle already advanced and explained, viz. that the right of &s;uffrage cannot belong to one man without be|longing to another; that it cannot belong to a part with|out belonging to the whole; and the whole being made up of parts, it follows that equal parts mu&s;t have equal rights. Therefore, every per&s;on who is deprived of this right, &s;u&s;tains an act of great violence, and is thereby, in appropriate language, made a &s;lave. For what can be greater &s;lavery than to be &s;ubject to the will and controul of our fellow men? It is in this that &s;lavery con&s;i&s;ts: It is again&s;t this ba&s;e villainage that the free mind of man perpetually revolts.</P>
<P>Every disfranchisement, however few the number dis|franchi&s;ed, is unju&s;t, and originates in <HI>power</HI> not in <HI>right.</HI> To illu&s;trate this po&s;ition we will &s;uppo&s;e a case. Sup|po&s;e when the federal compact was made, twelve &s;tates of the United States had combined to extend that confed|eration to the thirteenth, and "to bind it in all ca|ses what&s;oever," without allowing the &s;tate its right to an adequate &s;hare in the choice of the government;&mdash; would not &s;uch a proceeding have been a gro&s;s violation
<PB N="26" REF="037171_0023_100D8C83DF97C8A8">
of the rights of the &s;tate? As the federal compact was in|tended for the government of the whole, had not each &s;tate an equal right, according to its population, in the choice and formation of that government which &s;hould bind the whole? Mo&s;t certainly. If one &s;tate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the right, so did another, and so did the whole. Such an a&s;&s;umption would have been a palpable infraction of the rights of the &s;tate, and predicated only on the <HI>power</HI> of the <HI>twelve &s;tates</HI> to bind the <HI>thirteenth.</HI> This is obvi|ous. And is it le&s;s so for a larger or &s;maller number of people to combine to deprive any portion of the com|munity of their equal rights as men? The &s;uppo&s;ed dis|memberment of the &s;tate, and the &s;uppo&s;ition of the twelve &s;tates combining to bind the thirteenth to their will, &s;tands precisely on the &s;ame ground. In principle they are parallel: In practice both ca&s;es are unju&s;t ac|cording to the number of people disfranchised. And hence it is evident that for governments to he ju&s;tly con|&s;tructed, they mu&s;t be founded upon the univer&s;al equal|ity of man; &amp; that where they re&s;t not upon this broad ba|&s;is, they are u&s;urpations in proportion that this equality is wanting.</P>
<P>Privation of con&s;tituent rights, whether on an exten|&s;ive or &s;mall &s;cale, nece&s;&s;arily places mankind in a &s;tate of &s;entimental warfare; and there is no po&s;&s;ible method of extirpating the&s;e &s;eeds of di&s;&s;onance and di&s;&s;olution, and of rendering univer&s;al &s;atisfaction, but by giving to mankind their equal rights. Nor will this warfare be confined to mere &s;entiment longer than the injured and in&s;laved become &s;ufficiently powerful to re&s;i&s;t the tyran|ny. And then, both theory and modern hi&s;tory evinces that, impatient of unrea&s;onable and unnece&s;&s;ary re&s;traint, and indignant at the galling thought that a large moiety of mankind live only to &s;ub&s;erve the wants of the other; they bur&s;t forth like re&s;i&s;tle&s;s torrents; &s;weep away the odious and un&s;ufferable tyranny, and involve for a time, both the innocent and the guilty in indi&s;criminate chaos and blood&s;hed. But though the act be dire, yet it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary. Though revolutions are evils during their ex|i&s;tence, yet, their &s;eeds being &s;own in the inequality
<PB N="27" REF="037171_0024_100D8C869A65F710">
of men, it is to be expected that, nurtured by the genial warmth of patrioti&s;m, and the unextingui&s;hable love of man for the enjoyment of liberty, the period of their maturity mu&s;t arrive. This was the ca&s;e with the&s;e &s;tates: this was the cau&s;e which impelled and precipitat|ed France into her pre&s;ent revolution, and called into being that potent republic. But as liberty, with her con|&s;equent order and happine&s;s, has ari&s;en from the revolu|tion of the former, &s;o, we doubt not but that equal li|berty, and order, and happine&s;s, will re&s;ult from the latter.</P>
<P>Political inequality, like every act of violence, has nothing to defend it but force. It is a crime of the mo&s;t attrocious kind. It is engendered in wickedne&s;s; it is nouri&s;hed by venality; it is upheld by power: and it continues to be, until both become too weak for its &s;up|port; and then, like u&s;ele&s;s and exploded kings, it de|&s;cends to its natural level. Its &s;trong hold is ignorance; con&s;equently, as the human mind becomes illumined, the huge colo&s;&s;us crumbles into du&s;t, and oppre&s;&s;ed man, ri&s;ing from his dungeon, re&s;umes the &s;tation a&s;&s;igned him by his maker.</P>
<P>That political inequality is founded &s;olely on <HI>power,</HI> and is in its nature the highe&s;t &s;pecies of inju&s;tice, will appear &s;till more evident by pur&s;uing the &s;ubject a little further. For this purpo&s;e we beg the reader to bear in mind the idea of a given number of men, jointly leaving the &s;tate of nature and uniting to e&s;tabli&s;h a government for mutual advantage. This done, admit the a&s;&s;ump|tion of the rights of the whole by one half the given number. Could a government &s;o con&s;tituted be binding upon that half who&s;e a&s;&s;ent thereto had never been re|quired, and in the in&s;tituting of which they had nothing to do? We an&s;wer no. The con&s;ent of all the parts is indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to the legitimacy of the govern|ment. The a&s;&s;ent of the whole to particular modifica|tions is not nor cannot be expected. In all &s;uch ca&s;es the a&s;&s;ent of the majority of the whole mu&s;t forever be final. But what we contend for is the equal right of all to give being to and continue the exi&s;tence of govern|ment.

For as the con&s;ent of the parties is nece&s;&s;ary to make valid a contract between two men, &s;o the con&s;ent of all the parts of the community is alike nece&s;&s;ary to make valid a national compact. Both the&s;e po&s;itions flow from the &s;ame &s;ource, viz, that one man cannot of right be bound by another again&s;t his con&s;ent&mdash;To be free from &s;uch bondage is the only &s;ecurity we have for the pre&s;ervation of every thing e&s;timable to man. National freedom, &amp; the right of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, apper|tains equally to all men.

That liberty which &s;hould never be &s;urrendered but with life, that pre&s;ervation in the &s;tate, which &s;hould never be lo&s;t &s;ight of, would be of no value.</P>
<P>But there is another branch of this doctrine which re|quires inve&s;tigation and developement. For the purpo&s;e of reconciling a large moiety of mankind to their &s;tate of &s;lavery, a doctrine has been &s;edulou&s;ly propagated, that in the civil &s;tate it is nece&s;&s;ary to give up a great propor|tion of our <HI>natural</HI> rights in order to &s;ecure the enjoy|ment of the re&s;t. This doctrine has much plau&s;ibility and force where thought and inve&s;tigation is wanting. It is therefore well calculated to delude the ignorant, and is much inculcated by tho&s;e who profit by the fraud. It is univer&s;ally propagated in de&s;potic countries. A large proportion of Engli&s;hmen are laid a&s;leep with the pow|erful opiate. The &s;enate and the bar re&s;ounds with this en&s;laving doctrine; and three-fourths of the people are at this moment ready to &s;olace them&s;elves with the very comfortable idea, that the fewer privileges they enjoy in the kingdom, the more they comply with the ju&s;t princi|ples of civil government. Ala&s;s! what &s;tate is there to which uninformed men cannot be reduced by the perfi|dy and cunning of civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical tyranny?</P>
<P>In order to give this topic an ingenuous di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and to bring it fairly before the tribunal of the public and of rea&s;on, we &s;hall cite the opinions of two re&s;pectable au|thorities who differ widely on this &s;ubject. The&s;e are

It is ea&s;y to make &s;uch an a&s;&s;ertion, but it is not as ea&s;y to prove its truth in principle. If he meant it as a <HI>mere fact,</HI> when applied to &s;ome &s;tates, its authenti|city cannot be doubted. Indeed he might have gone farther. Nineteen twentieths of the people of England have &s;carcely any privileges.

it is this, that every per&s;on, on entering the civil &s;tate, <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> &s;urrenders to the contracting parties or "&s;overeign," a part of the privileges appertaining to him in the &s;tate of nature. In order to determine this po&s;ition it is nece&s;&s;ary to de&s;tingui&s;h what privileges there are in the &s;tate of nature which men cannot enjoy in the civil &s;tate. Until this be done, we &s;hall prate like par|rots, without having in the mind a clear and di&s;tinct per|ception of the things of which we &s;peak. Here then we declare without he&s;itancy or ambiguity, that we know of no privileges appertaining to men in the &s;tate of nature which they cannot enjoy in the civil &s;tate compatibly with the ju&s;t principles of civil government.</P>
<P>What privileges are there belonging to man in the &s;tate of nature, the fruition of which are nece&s;&s;arily denied them in the civil &s;tate?</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid that in the &s;tate of nature the actions of men are not re&s;trained, that there being no authority e&s;tabli&s;hed by law to puni&s;h offences, men are free to do what they plea&s;e. So far as this relates to the <HI>power</HI> of man to do wrong in the &s;tate of nature, without being &s;ubject to puni&s;hment by the regular operation of law, the po&s;ition is correct; but certainly not so as to <HI>right.</HI> Rea|son exclaims as loudly again&s;t inju&s;tice in the natural as in the civil &s;tate. It is not that because there is no law to puni&s;h injuries done in the natural &s;tate that men are free to commit them; &s;ince the &s;ame injuries done to our fellow men in the natural, are as great offences again&s;t reason and ju&s;tice as they are again&s;t law in the civil &s;tate, which is no more than the expo&s;ition of that rea&s;on &amp; jus|tice which equally pervades both. If a man in the &s;tate of nature &s;hould invade and &s;ack his neighbour's property, deprive him of life or limb, or immure him in durance during his plea&s;ure; would &s;uch acts be crimes of le&s;s magnitude in the eye of rea&s;on becau&s;e in that &s;tate there is no law to puni&s;h &s;uch offences? Certainly not. Rea|&s;on, on which punative laws again&s;t burglary, hou&s;e-breaking, murder and the like are founded, condemns the commi&s;&s;ion of the&s;e offences in the &s;tate of nature, as much as the laws founded there on will puni&s;h their per|petration

in the civil &s;tate. <HI>Mutual justice,</HI> and that love of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation predominant in every man, &s;olemnly and powerfully forbids us, in <HI>every &s;tate,</HI> to injure each other in life, liberty, or property. For if I respect not these things in others, how can I expect others to respect them in me? This is rea&s;on, which in the &s;tate of nature, is the law of that &s;tate; and which in the civil &s;tate, is the foundation of all the good laws with which man|kind have ever been ble&s;&s;ed. Therefore, as it never was the <HI>right</HI> of man to do <HI>wrong,</HI> and as it would be wrong for one man to injure another, so it cannot be a privilege of the natural &s;tate to commit inju&s;tice, which, in a well regulated civil &s;tate would not pa&s;s unpuni&s;hed. But if any one &s;hould &s;till incline to the opinion that to do wrong is a privilege of the &s;tate of nature, to &s;uch we observe, that the &s;ooner this unrea&s;onable privilege be "&s;urrendered to the Sovereign," and thence bani&s;hed forever from the pre&s;ence of man, the better; nor &s;hould we in the civil &s;tate lo&s;e much liberty by its flight.</P>
<P>But if the perpetration of offences oppugnant to rea&s;on and ju&s;tice, be a privilege of the natural, it is al&s;o, we contend, equally a privilege of the civil &s;tate. Men have the &s;ame power to violate the great maxims of ju&s;tice in the civil, that they have in the natural &s;tate. The civil &s;tate does not nor cannot deprive men of the power to commit inju&s;tice. They &s;till retain the capability of per|petrating crimes which &s;hock humanity and inflict mise|ry upon human beings. But tho' they have the <HI>power</HI> to commit them in <HI>both,</HI> yet they have not the right in <HI>either.</HI> As men may commit murder, the mo&s;t horrid of all crimes, in the natural, so they may in the civil &s;tate. Nor is this or any other crime le&s;s ju&s;tifiable in the one than in the other. The only difference that we perceive, in this respect, between the two &s;tates, is this, that in the civil &s;tate laws compels &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to their regular opera|tion. Whereas there being no law in the natural &s;tate to compel obedience, offenders add to their offences by re|&s;i&s;ting that puni&s;hment which rea&s;on pre&s;cribes and indi|vidual &s;afety requires.</P>
<P>But we will allow, to &s;hew the ab&s;urdity of the po&s;i|tion,
<PB N="33" REF="037171_0030_100D8C92F8431F38">
that to do wrong or to commit inju&s;tice, is a pri|vilege of the natural &s;tate; yet, for what purpo&s;e is it nece&s;&s;ary that this privilege &s;hould be &s;urrendered by individuals to the &s;tate unle&s;s to be exerci&s;ed by the &s;o|vereign to whom the &s;urrender is made? And if to be exerci&s;ed by the &s;overeign or whole, how is it to operate but by abu&s;ing its parts? If this &s;uppo&s;ed privilege of nature be &s;o exceedingly baleful that individuals cannot u&s;e it in the civil &s;tate without injuring each other, and the whole, how much more injurious would it be for the &s;tate to po&s;&s;e&s;s and exerci&s;e it? What mu&s;t be the &s;itua|tion of the &s;tate when &s;aturated with this load of abomi|nation? Would the mighty ma&s;s of peccancy and inju&s;|tice lie dormant in the body politic? No. Would there be no danger of fermentation? Yes. Like ve&s;uvius it would belch forth and &s;catter over the pale of its influ|ence, its deteriorating lava. And is it more ju&s;tifiable for a nation to do wrong than for an individual? Be|&s;ides if it ever was a privilege of men to do wrong in any &s;tate, to &s;urrender it is impo&s;&s;ible. To render man|kind incapable of violating moral ju&s;tice, it is nece&s;&s;ary to <HI>invert nature,</HI> to create man anew, and of <HI>purer</HI> ma|terials. The bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;ociety is to prevent as far as po&s;&s;ible the commi&s;&s;ion of offences, and where it cannot rea&s;onably to cha&s;ti&s;e them. Therefore, as it never was a privilege of the natural &s;tate to infringe the law of rea|&s;on, it follows that that which never was a privilege can never be &s;urrendered.</P>
<P>But as men have conceded to the civil &s;tate a power to puni&s;h offences committed again&s;t the &s;afety of its mem|bers, have they not, by the conce&s;&s;ion, &s;urrendered a right appertaining to them in the &s;tate of nature? If we were to an&s;wer this que&s;tion in the affirmative, it would make nothing for tho&s;e who contend that men cannot enjoy in the civil &s;tate their natural rights; &s;ince, the power to puni&s;h wrongs is conceded equally by the whole; is founded upon a rule of mutual ju&s;tice, and e&s;tabli&s;hed by mutual con&s;ent. This rule can never ope|rate to &s;uppre&s;s or prevent acts promotive of the general
<PB N="34" REF="037171_0031_100D8C9508A99EF0">
good. Its great province is to puni&s;h, in a fair and ra|tional way, actions which violate the law of rea&s;on, di&s;turb puplic repo&s;e, and le&s;&s;en puplic happine&s;s. But to this que&s;tion we an&s;wer, that &s;o far from men &s;urrendering any of their natural rights by lodging this power in the civil &s;tate, that they thereby acquire privileges which, in the natural &s;tate, they cannot po&s;&s;ibly enjoy.</P>
<P>If men, in any ca&s;e, &s;urrender to the civil &s;tate, on entering therein, any of the rights which flow from the &s;tate of nature, it is by inve&s;ting in the &s;overeign punitive powers. In the natural &s;tate the right of punition ap|pertains only to the &s;u&s;tainers of injury. For though all offences again&s;t the law of rea&s;on are real offences again&s;t the &s;afety of all within their reach, and are truly puni&s;ha|ble; yet, it is by compact only that tho&s;e who are not real and immediate &s;ufferers come by power to puni&s;h them. But in the natural &s;tate it will readily occur to every one that the power to puni&s;h mu&s;t be frequently wanting in injured per&s;ons. For he who is wicked and daring enough to commit murder, robbery, or any of the le&s;s offences in the natural, which, by the laws of the civil &s;tate, merit legal cha&s;ti&s;ement, will not voluntarily, &s;ubmit to a ju&s;t retribution of puni&s;hment. To compel &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to an equitable rule equally e&s;tabli&s;hed, forms a principal part of civil government. But though in this a&s;&s;ociation a power to puni&s;h infractions of its rules is ve&s;ted, yet, the natural right of each individual is not thereby impaired. Every man, who, in the civil &s;tate, &s;u&s;tains criminal offence, has the &s;ame right to puni&s;h the criminal by law that he has in the natural &s;tate by rea&s;on. So that, on entering the civil &s;tate, we &s;urrender not our natural right of puni&s;hing per&s;onal injuries. In the com|mutation we lo&s;e nothing: on the contrary we gain by the change. For if, in the civil &s;tate, criminal offence be committed again&s;t me; though I my&s;elf have the right to pro&s;ecute the offender to puni&s;hment, yet, if unable, from whatever cau&s;e, the &s;tate mu&s;t pro&s;ecute for me. This privilege of the civil belongs not to the natural &s;tate. It is merely acquired by and re&s;ults from men combining together for reciprocal protection. So that,
<PB N="35" REF="037171_0032_100D8C96F5F6E160">
in the civil &s;tate, the natural right of individuals to pu|ni&s;h offences committed again&s;t them, is not only pre|&s;erved in its purity and fulne&s;s, but they have, in addi|tion, the whole community to aid them. Therefore, &s;o far from inverting &s;ociety with punitive power, being a &s;urrender of natural rights or privileges, that is a &s;ub|&s;tantial and happy enlargement of natural liberty.</P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid, it re&s;ults,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, that men never had, in the natural &s;tate, a right to do wrong. And as it is evident that no one can &s;ur|render what he never po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, &s;o, this cannot be one of the &s;uppo&s;ed privileges &s;urrendered to the civil &s;tate.</P>
<P>Secondly, that if it ever was the right of men to do wrong, that right mu&s;t forever appertain to them in every &s;tate: &s;ince, the right mu&s;t be determined by rea&s;on, who&s;e laws are unalterably the &s;ame. And as rea&s;on can|not approve or &s;anction that in one man which injures the rights of another, or violates equal ju&s;tice; &s;o, to do wrong, or to violate equal ju&s;tice, cannot be a privilege of the &s;tate of nature.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, the placing power in the civil &s;tate, to puni&s;h offences committed again&s;t its &s;afety, does not impair one jot the right which belong to men in the &s;tate of nature, of individually puni&s;hing individual injuries. But on the contrary this right is not only pre&s;erved in its pri&s;|tine &s;tate, but is additionally &s;trengthened by the additi|tional acce&s;&s;ion of the conjoint protection of the &s;ociety or &s;overeign.</P>
<P>Whither then &s;hall we &s;eek for the "&s;urrendered pri|vileges?" Diogenes with his lanthorn and acumen would find it difficult to di&s;cover them. Of what do they con&s;i&s;t? It is plain that governments cannot be con&s;ider|ed in any other light than as re&s;traints upon tho&s;e actions which, in every &s;tate, defies the law of rea&s;on; but which, in the natural &s;tate, cannot conveniently be puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>A brief analy&s;is of our actions will make this appear evident.</P>
<P>All the va&s;t and va&s;tly diver&s;ified actions of men may be cla&s;&s;ed under three heads:</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="037171_0033_100D8C98D2AE3DE8">Fir&s;t, virtuous actions, or &s;uch as promote individual and general good</P>
<P>Secondly, indifferent ones, or &s;uch as produce neither good nor evil con&s;equences to &s;ociety. And,</P>
<P>Thirdly, vicious actions, or &s;uch as are evidently pernicious to individuals and to the &s;tate.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t&mdash;It is evident that govern|mental laws can have nothing to do with virtuous actions. Governments are neither in&s;tituted to prevent nor to puni&s;h them. And where they do either, they are go|vernments of violence, not of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the &s;econd&mdash;Laws are always indif|ferent where actions are &s;o. They cannot, take cogni|&s;ance of actions which neither produce good nor bad con&s;equences to the &s;tate. They are with the&s;e as with virtuous ones, mere unimportant and dormant parch|ments They cannot operate; &s;ince, men cannot, a|greeably to rea&s;on and to ju&s;t laws, either be puni&s;hed or rewarded for actions as devoid of utility as they are of evil con&s;equences.</P>
<P>In regard to the third.&mdash;Here laws operate within their province. The power placed in the civil &s;tate to puni&s;h crimes committed again&s;t the law of rea&s;on, which, in the natural &s;tate, cannot conveniently be puni&s;hed, here operate in its full force and to accompli&s;hed the de|&s;igned end, viz. that men may be free from violence and inju&s;tice. The &s;ole de&s;ign of government is to prevent men from violating the &s;acred rights of each other, and, where it cannot, to puni&s;h offenders. Governments are of no other u&s;e among men. Nor can they operate in any other manner without committing the identical injus|tice to prevent which they are in&s;tituted. Their powers then being &s;olely confined to the prevention and puni&s;h|ment of actions &s;ubver&s;ive of ju&s;tice, and which violates the law of rea&s;on, on which civil laws are founded, it is clear, that, in civil &s;ocieties &s;tanding upon univer&s;al jus|tice, men do not nor cannot &s;urrender any of the rights or privileges appertaining to them in the &s;tate of nature.</P>
<P>Having &s;hewn that men cannot, con&s;i&s;tently with rea|&s;on and ju&s;tice, relinqui&s;h, on entering the civil &s;tate, any
<PB N="37" REF="037171_0034_100D8C9B2A141458">
of the immunities which appertain to the &s;tate of nature; we &s;hall now briefly enquire,</P>
<P>How the &s;uppo&s;ed privileges are to be relinqui&s;hed, al|lowing them to be relinqui&s;hable; whether according to ju&s;tice, and if &s;o, to whom are they to be &s;urrendered?</P>
<P>We imagine that even the e&s;teemers of the &s;purious and trammelling doctrine of &s;urrendering natural privil|eges to the civil &s;tate, do not wi&s;h to be under&s;tood that a partial and unju&s;t relinqui&s;hment is what they contend for. To be con&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves they mu&s;t allow, that if by the regular and inevitable operation of enter|ing the civil &s;tate, it be really nece&s;&s;ary for one man to &s;urrender thereto a given portion of privileges, it is al|&s;o equally nece&s;&s;ary for each and every one to give up the &s;ame portion. If this be not their meaning; if they do not pay due deference to rea&s;on and ju&s;tice, their dis|cour&s;es may be con&s;idered as mere political delu&s;ion and fine&s;&s;e, by which, at one &s;troke mankind are meant to be divided into two parts, the one to govern, limited only by power, and the other implicitly to obey. But in this we neither discover philo&s;ophy nor philanthropy; we neither &s;ee rea&s;on or ju&s;tice; which if they abandon, they are not worth contending with. We &s;hall therefore &s;up|po&s;e them to be actuated by pure principle, &amp; advocates for pure and univer&s;al ju&s;tice: and on this ground we pledge our&s;elves to &s;hew the utter impo&s;&s;ibility of making &s;uch &s;urrender.</P>
<P>This then may, we conceive, be laid down as an ax|iom, that if is be nece&s;&s;ary and unavoidable for one man, on entering the civil &s;tate, to &s;urrender to that &s;tate, a given quantity of natural privileges, it is equally nece&s;&s;a|ry and unavoidable for every one of the contracting par|ties to &s;urrender an equally given quantity. If it be ne|ce&s;&s;ary for one man, it is al&s;o equally nece&s;&s;ary for ano|ther, and for the whole.&mdash;A po&s;ition &s;o &s;elf-evident is not &s;u&s;ceptible of additional proof. Suppo&s;e, then, the citizens of the United States, who are adults, to con&s;i&s;t of one million; and that they &s;hall all &s;urrender to the State an equal number of privileges: Axiom "if equals be taken from equals the wholes are equals;" therefore,

if the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;urrender of privileges be equally made the identical equality of the natural &s;tate, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily and unavoidably prevail in the civil; &s;ince, by taking from each individual an equal quantity of natural privil|eges, the whole mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be equal; and con&s;e|quently be left in the &s;ame &s;tate of perfect equality in which they were prior to entering into the civil &s;tate, and the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;urrender of natural privileges.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the Corporation of New-York.</HEAD>
<P>It is a que&s;tion of importance to the citizens of New-York, and has &s;ome claim to their attention, whether the corporation of the city, all things con&s;idered, is or not of public utility; and if not, to what cau&s;e its inutility is attributable? It is time to determine the utility of ci|vil politics by the beneficial effects they produce; e&s;pe|cially one of &s;uch va&s;t expence, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch immen&s;e and deliterious influence as that of our corpo|ration. The heterogenious cau&s;es which fir&s;t brought incorporations into being in modern Europe, and which entitled them to &s;ome deference, do not now, nor never did exi&s;t within the&s;e &s;tates. We are neither borne down by the imperiou&s;ne&s;s of baronial tyranny on the one hand, nor moved to compa&s;&s;ionate the &s;ufferings of va&s;|&s;als on the other. <NOTE N="(j)" PLACE="foot"><P>Hume, speaking of corporations, says "Even in France, a coun|try which made more early advances in arts and civility than England, the first corporation is sixty years posterior to the conquest under the duke of Normandy; and the erecting of these communities was an invention of Lewis the Gross, in order to free the people from tyranny under their lords, and to give them protection, by means of certain privileges and a seperate jurisdiction. An ancient French writer calls them a new and wicked device to procure liberty to slaves, and encourage them in shaking off the dominion of their masters!"

are pa&s;&s;ed. But European incorporations produced ad|vantages, <HI>when fir&s;t in&s;tituted,</HI> which do not nor cannot accompany them in the United States. They introduc|ed a degree of <HI>liberty</HI> within their jurisdictions favorable to the citizens and quite unknown beyond their limits. And though they produced but partial good, yet they were proportionately &s;erviceable. But it would be dif|ficult to conceive what corporations have to do with li|berty within the&s;e &s;tates, except to bani&s;h it as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible from them. In a republic like this, where re|pre&s;entative &s;y&s;tems of government prevail in great a|bundance and perfection; and where a greater degree of liberty is enjoyed without then within their jurisdictions, while they can be but of little &s;ervice to the citizens, they are capable of an infinity of mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>This chapter is intended to &s;hew the propriety of alter|ing the pre&s;ent mode of appointing the Chief Magi&s;trate of the city. For this purpo&s;e we &s;olicit the attention of the reader to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the following propo&s;i|tions.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. That the pre&s;ent mode of appointing the Chief magi&s;trate of the city is unju&s;t.</P>
<P>Second. That to en&s;ure a pure admini&s;tration of the Mayoralty, it is e&s;&s;ential that the Mayor be elected by the citizens over whom he pre&s;ides.</P>
<P>La&s;tly. That until the citizens enjoy this right, how|ever noxious the Chief magi&s;trate may be, they have no power to remove him.</P>
<P>In politics there is, perhaps, no maxim clearer than this, that the people, for whom a Government is intend|ed, have the exclu&s;ive right of "choo&s;ing their own gov|ernors." For laws being, of right, founded upon the
<PB N="41" REF="037171_0038_100D8CA352360C60">
united conduct of men and in&s;tituted for their &s;afety, tho&s;e for who&s;e benefit they are intended are the <HI>only proper persons to determine</HI> the fitne&s;s of men to make and to admini&s;ter them&mdash; The lea&s;t interference with this right of &s;elf-judgment is unju&s;t. For though A. may be more competent to judge of the concerns of B. than B. him&s;elf, and on that account his judgment may be &s;ome|times &s;olicited, yet for A. to judge for B. by e&s;tabli&s;hed rule, again&s;t his con&s;ent, and with power to bind him by his deci&s;ions, is a mo&s;t un&s;ufferable tyranny. To this conclu&s;ion every one will a&s;&s;ent. And yet if we te&s;t the appointment of the mayor by this rule we &s;hall find that it is &s;ounded upon it. This we &s;hall do; and that we may be the better under&s;tood we &s;hall &s;hew, from the con&s;titution the manner of his appointment.</P>
<P>In Art. 18. of the con&s;titution, it is provided, "That all officers, other than tho&s;e who by this con&s;titution are directed to be otherwi&s;e appointed, &s;hall be appointed in the manner following, to wit: the a&s;&s;embly &s;hall, once in every year, openly nominate and appoint one of the &s;enators from each great di&s;trict, which &s;enators &s;hall form a council for the appointment of the &s;aid officers, of which the governor for the time being, or the lieutenant governor, or the pre&s;ident of the &s;enate, when they &s;hall re&s;pectively admini&s;ter the government, &s;hall be pre&s;ident and have a ca&s;ting voice, but no other vote: and with advice and con&s;ent of the &s;aid council, &s;hall appoint all the &s;aid officers; and that a majority of the &s;aid council be a quorum; and further, the &s;aid &s;enators &s;hall not be eligible to the &s;aid council for two years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively." Greenleaf's edition of the laws of New-York, 1798.</P>
<P>Particular provi&s;ion not being made in the con&s;titution for the election of the mayor, his appointment falls within the province of this council, which, after a delu&s;ively refining proce&s;s, con&s;i&s;t of four &s;enators, one from each di&s;trict of the &s;tate. To evince the inju&s;tice of this mode of appointment we &s;hall &s;hew by analogy that the right of appointing or electing the mayor and (of cour&s;e eve|ry corporate officer now appointed by the council) ap|pertains
<PB N="42" REF="037171_0039_100D8CA66EFD5BA0">
exclu&s;ively to the people within the pale of the corporation: and con&s;equently for other per&s;ons to ex|erci&s;e that right is unju&s;t. But as the legi&s;lature may, by another part of the con&s;titution of the &s;tate take this privilege from the council and transfer it to the citizens within the corporate jurisdiction, it is only for them re|&s;pectfully to command it and it mu&s;t be done.</P>
<P>It is meet that the corporation &s;hould acknowledge the con&s;titution of the &s;tate as its &s;upreme guide and that all its proceedings &s;hould be in coincidence with its prin|ciples. For this purpo&s;e, as the corporation depends upon the &s;uffrage of the &s;tate for its being, it is nece&s;&s;a|ry that the legi&s;lature &s;hould take cognizance of its pro|ceedings, but only where they are incongruous with the con&s;titution. Under this re&s;triction <HI>only</HI> the people with|in the corporation &s;hould be left to regulate their own concerns.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s of the corporation, as it re&s;pects intern|al police, is as di&s;tant from that of the agregate &s;tate, as legi&s;lation in one &s;tate is from that of another. The corporation is an in&s;ular polity, in&s;tituted for local pur|po&s;es: Its boundaries, its jurisdiction, its powers, ex|tend not beyond the confines of the i&s;land. <NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">See charts of New-York, Geo. II. p. <HI>35&mdash;6.</HI></NOTE> It is in|tended &s;olely to affect the people within its limits or it is not. If it be not, if its juri&s;diction be not bounded by a known divi&s;ion of the &s;tate, its rights and its powers mu&s;t be commen&s;urate with it. But this no one will a&s;|&s;ert. If its jurisdiction extend not beyond the bounds of the city, and it be intended &s;olely for the citizens, which every one mu&s;t acknowledge, then by the &s;ame rule that the people of the &s;tate have the &s;ole right of electing the legi&s;lature thereof, viz. that of managing their own concerns, tho&s;e of the city have the exclu&s;ive right of electing city officers. The bu&s;ine&s;s of the city being di&s;tinct from that of the entire &s;tate, the &s;tate ought not, after &s;uffering a provincial government to be erect|ed within it, to interfere in its ulterior regulations, ex|cept as before &s;aid, where tho&s;e regulations cla&s;h with the
<PB N="43" REF="037171_0040_100D8CA8043E9BE0">
con&s;titution. To interfere in any other ca&s;e is as unju&s;t as it would be for one &s;tate to interfere in the internal le|gi&s;tation of another.</P>
<P>This &s;elf-management of &s;elf-concerns, is the vital part of government. Accordingly we find that, where there is danger of foreign interference, governments ve|ry properly repel it with &s;uitable pertinacity. But fo|reign interference is in its nature relative. The federal government would ju&s;tly term that foreign interference which, contrary to the exclu&s;ive management of its own concerns, &s;hould be attempted to be introduced into it by a foreign government. So, for the federal government to interfere in the internal regulation of the re&s;pective &s;tates, would be foreign interference. And &s;o if this &s;tate &s;hould intermeddle in the internal political arrangements of Connecticut, notwith&s;tanding the juxta-po&s;ition of the two &s;tates, yet, the interference would be as unju&s;t and foreign as if it came from tran&s;atlantic parts. This nece&s;|&s;arily flows from this the&s;is, that &s;eperate body politics ought to manage their own concerns. This is the right of &s;elf-judgment for which we contend, and which is as applicable to our corporation con&s;idered with the &s;tate, as it is to one &s;tate con&s;idered with another.</P>
<P>If it be fit and requi&s;ite for the council to appoint the mayor of the city, it is equally &s;o for them to appoint the aldermen, which they do not. But in the pre&s;ent mode in which this bu&s;ine&s;s is tran&s;acted, we &s;ee nothing of tho&s;e cheering improvements, which, generally, have &s;o ju&s;tly and eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed American politics. The appointment of the mayor by the council is a faith|ful tran&s;cript, implicitly taken, but exi&s;ting under di&s;&s;i|mular circum&s;tances, of that e&s;tabli&s;hed in the charter of George II. At that era England held dominion over the&s;e &s;tates, and it was con&s;onant with her u&s;ual policy towards them to &s;uffer the citizens to enjoy a few unim|portant privileges, &s;uch as electing alderman, con&s;tables and &s;o on; but to take e&s;pecial care that with re&s;pect to important offices &s;uch as mayor, recorder, &s;heriff, &amp;c. they &s;hould be appointed by the governor, who was ap|pointed by the king. The better to keep the citizens in
<PB N="44" REF="037171_0041_100D7F2639BDD088">
va&s;&s;alage, and at the &s;ame time plea&s;ingly to reconcile them to that gloomy &s;tate, they were &s;uffered to enjoy tho&s;e petty privileges. Like a cunning conqueror who, to perpetuate his conque&s;t and to reconcile the conquer|ed to the conqueror, the king was <HI>graciously pleased</HI> to allow the citizens to enjoy privileges from the exerci&s;e of which, it was conceived, no injury to his domination could re&s;ult. But &s;urely there is no occa&s;ion for the &s;tate legi&s;lature to treat the people of the city, in this re&s;pect, as they were wont to be treated by <HI>this British king.</HI> It is impo&s;&s;ible for the legi&s;lature to entertain the idea that imparting to the citizens the right of electing their copo|rate officers, would be dangerous to their power. But if they could, <HI>that power is unju&s;t which does not flow from, and the exercise of which does not comport with the liberty of the people;</HI> and therefore its reduction could not be rea&s;onable ground for regret. But the intere&s;t of our government is not incompatible with that of the citizens. The intere&s;t of the one is the intere&s;t of the other. They are identically the &s;ame. But this was not the ca&s;e with the government of Great Britain who&s;e object was taxa|tion, &amp; therefore the deeper the people were immerged in &s;lavery the more of their income might be extorted from them. On the other hand every thing e&s;timable to America demanded that &s;he &s;hould rid her&s;elf of the de|te&s;table yoke as &s;oon as circum&s;tances would permit.</P>
<P>The appointment of the mayor by the council, like every other act not founded upon rea&s;on, is irreconcila|ble even with it&s;elf. Nor is it probable that if the con|&s;titution had been di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in a period of peace, the pre|&s;ent mode would have been recognized. But having once had being, like many other errors, it has been continued. If the citizens can regulate their corporate concerns in part, without legi&s;lative interpo&s;ition, why may they not in the whole &s;ubject to con&s;titutional checks for uncon&s;titutional aberrations? The &s;tate compels the corporaion to defray its own expence and at the &s;ame time deprives the citizens of the right of electing their city of|ficers! This is an exten&s;ive branch of that &s;y&s;tem again&s;t which the United States contended, and what is &s;till more
<PB N="45" REF="037171_0042_100D8CACC3D143B0">
&s;trange was even acted upon by the State during the con|flict!</P>
<P>That the citizens of the corporation have a right to regulate their own bu&s;ine&s;s is acknowledged by the State Legi&s;lature, as it re&s;pects city expence, with which the State has nothing to do as to contribution. Why do not the State provide, by general tax, for defraying the ex|pence of the city? Becau&s;e that expence being incurred by city regulations <HI>only,</HI> it would be unju&s;t for tho&s;e liv|ing beyond its limits and who are not partakers of its benefits, to bear any part of its burdens. In this res|pect the city is con&s;idered as a &s;ort of integer, acknowl|edging, certainly, the &s;upremacy of the State, but left to it&s;elf as to revenue regulations. But if tho&s;e living without the limits of the city ought not on that account to bear any part of its expence, for the &s;ame rea&s;on they ought to have no concern with its internal police. For the State to appoint charter officers to rule <HI>over</HI> the citi|zens, and to incur expences which mu&s;t be borne &s;olely by them, is comparable to quartering State &s;oldiers of equal permanence and expence on a particular Town, The freedom of the citizens in both ca&s;es is alike viola|ted; and the inju&s;tice of the one can only be equalled by the inju&s;tice of the other.</P>
<P>That the citzens have the Chief magi&s;trate thus impo|&s;ed upon them, can admit of little doubt. To prove this it will only be nece&s;&s;ary to advert to the manner of his appointment. The council by which he is appointed, is thus compo&s;ed. Every citizen who pays taxes to the State, and rents a hou&s;e of the yearly value of forty &s;hil|lings is eligible to vote for a&s;&s;emblymen. Senators are elected by citizens po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of freehold e&s;tate of the value of an hundred pounds, free of incumbrance. The two hou&s;es being thus compo&s;ed, the a&s;&s;embly elect from the Senate the council of appointment. In this council the &s;outhern di&s;trict, in which the city is comprehended, has one member, who can only be <HI>pre&s;umed</HI> to repre&s;ent the city, &s;ince the di&s;trict of which he is the repre&s;enta|tive, includes it. It would be a misapplication of words to term this Senator the repre&s;entative of the city, who&s;e
<PB N="46" REF="037171_0043_100D8CAF2B6EF908">
votes, compared with tho&s;e of the di&s;trict at large, are certainly not more than as one to &s;ix. But if he was the repre&s;entative of the city and the only per&s;on who ap|points the Mayor, &s;till, the placing in his hands by the &s;tate&punc; the right of the citizens to judge them&s;elves of the fitne&s;s of per&s;ons to fill the Mayoralty, is unju&s;t. To take from the people this right of &s;elf judgment, is dan|gerous to liberty. Of this no one, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the or|dinary &s;en&s;es of a man, will doubt. We have countle&s;s and &s;triking facts which invite our attention every day in Europe of the awful effects which re&s;ult from this &s;ur|render. Nor are we without in&s;tructive le&s;&s;ons in our own country of its dangerous tendencies. <NOTE N="(l.)" PLACE="foot">Had the Senate of the United States been elected by citizens eli|gible to vote for members of the house of representatives, instead of being appointed by State Senates; that most baleful instrument, the British treaty, the treat Patriarch of all the evils with which the United States are now afflicted, would not, in all probability, have been ratified. Be|sides, look at the Senators sent from what are called federal States, exam|ine their speeches and votes, and compare them with the spirit of the revo|lution and the sound principles of the federal constitution, and every in|telligent man will see just and serious cause for regret, that the people <HI>them&s;elves</HI> do not elect them. There is nothing more common in this state than to see Republicans deputed by the people &amp; federalists appointed by the Senate. A plain proof that where the people suffer others to judge for them, they are in danger of being misrepresented. But perhaps this is one of those ineffable checks and balances eulogined by President Adams!</NOTE> It is a &s;pe|cies of that <HI>virtual repre&s;entation</HI> so much admired by Monarchi&s;ts, but which is &s;o utterly incon&s;onant with the genius of republican America. It is the negation of con&s;tituent immunities, and the never failing operator of the &s;lavery of man.</P>
<P>But allowing this Senator to be the repre&s;entative of the city, and that it is meet he &s;hould judge for the citi|zens, &s;till he is only one oppo&s;ed to three per&s;ons in the Council. And who are they? People who re&s;ide out of the di&s;trict in which the city is, and who, for ought we we know, never &s;aw it. The&s;e gentlemen &s;urely will not be called the repre&s;entatives of the city. In them the cit|izens have no choice. They are the deputies of districts who&s;e intere&s;t may not accord with that of the city, and who&s;e &s;entiments may be repugnant to tho&s;e of the
<PB N="47" REF="037171_0044_100D8CB0C1DB4010">
citizens. They are men over whom the citizens of New-York have no controul. They may therefore impo&s;e upon them a Chief-magi&s;trate of turbulent &amp; acerberous dispo&s;ition, and who in every respect is oppo&s;ed to their &s;entiments and wi&s;hes. And where is the remedy?</P>
<P>It is to be expected, from every thing the world has hitherto furni&s;hed, that the &s;entiments and adminis|tration of the Mayor will accord with con&s;iderable exac|titude with the &s;entiments of tho&s;e by whom he is ap|pointed. This has been peculiarly verified by the pre&s;ent incumbent. The members of the council of appoint|ment for years back have been federali&s;ts; and &s;o is the Mayor who has held that office <HI>ten years.</HI> What has been the con&s;equence? Every one who is acquainted with his general admini&s;tration need not be told of the partiality he has exhibited towards tho&s;e of federal &s;entiments, and the rancour and enmity to Republicans. No one is &s;o ignorant as not to know what he has done both in public and private life to exalt the one and to &s;ink the other. But this was to have been and may in future be expect|ed, unle&s;s the Legi&s;lature &s;hould, in their wisdom, give to the citizens the right of his election. This is the only radical cure.&mdash;In the city there is a large and unequivo|cal majority of republicans; but what will this avail the citizens unle&s;s it &s;hould be &s;o far the ca&s;e throughout the States, as that in the A&s;&s;embly there &s;hould be a con&s;tant majority; or even then, unle&s;s in the &s;enate there &s;hould be one republican Senator from three of the four di&s;tricts? The citizens might &s;till be &s;addled with a Mayor of &s;entiments ho&s;tile to their own; and who, like Burke's king, would hold the Mayoralty in "contempt of their choice." Is this freedom? Is this repre&s;entation? Is it political justice.</P>
<P>To &s;ecure a faithful execution of office and a decent respect for the &s;entiments of the people, it is e&s;&s;ential that the officers of government be elected by them. To make them independent of this only &s;ource of power, is to make the people &s;ub&s;ervient to their views. This is an inver&s;ion of order. This is political inju&s;tice. Where|as to make them <HI>really</HI> dependent upon the people is of it&s;elf &s;ufficient to induce mea&s;ures con&s;i&s;tent with their
<PB N="48" REF="037171_0045_100D8CB28AB8C810">
happine&s;s, and to impel even a Nero to deeds of ju&s;tice and of mercy.</P>
<P>To accompli&s;h this end in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary that the citizens within the limits of the corpora|tion, who are eligible to vote for a&s;&s;emblymen, &s;hould elect the Mayor. In this ca&s;e, if his reliance upon them &s;hould not, contrary to rational calculation and univer|&s;al experience, induce a ju&s;t admini&s;tration, they might at the end of the period for which he &s;hould be elected, &s;upercede him. This is a nece&s;&s;ary part of election, that the people may, by ingenuous discu&s;&s;ions, determine how far tho&s;e whom they have honored with their tru&s;t &amp; con|fidence, merit their continuance. But at pre&s;ent, tho' the citizens may &s;peak of the admini&s;tration of the Mayor, yet having no choice in his election however iniquitous that admini&s;tration may be, they cannot remove him. They may indeed hope that he may be a good man, and if it &s;hould &s;o happen it is well; but if not, they have him "for better and for wor&s;e;" they are obliged to bear with him. The prevalence of republicani&s;m throughout the &s;tate may produce a &s;alutary change of men; and this is the only ground of hope from the pre&s;ent mode of appointment. But though a change thus effected would be acceptable; yet for the citizens con&s;tantly to rely upon this contingence, even &s;hould it be as con&s;tantly realized, would be improper ina&s;muCh as the <HI>&s;tate</HI> and not <HI>themselves</HI> would furni&s;h the city with its Chief Ma|gi&s;trate. <NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">We are not desirous of copying political systems implicitly. But where we can cull choice parts from systems compounded of good and bad materials, no friend to human improvement can object to it. Even in London, the seat of every thing venal, the freemen choose their own mayor. And notwithstanding Pitt, in the plenitude of his intrigue and seduction, endeavoured at the last election to impose upon them a Chief Magistrate of his own choice, yet we have seen, with admiration, that all his schemes were unavailing. The firmne&s;s of the freemen was superior to all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> of this disturber of human repute.</NOTE></P>
<P>Such are the peculiar hard&s;hips under which the citi|zens labour from the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem!</P>
<P>Where the &s;ucce&s;s of actions depend upon efforts pro|portioned to the end, men exert them&s;elves with cheer|fulne&s;s.

But, when by uncommon exertions the attain|ment of objects ardently de&s;ired borders on impo&s;&s;ibility, the nece&s;&s;ary excitement to ultimate &s;ucce&s;s dimini&s;hes; and in&s;tead of being arou&s;ed to actions apportioned to the magnitude of the prize, we are too apt to &s;uccumb under the incumbent and unplea&s;ing pre&s;&s;ure. Such is the gloomy pro&s;pect of the citizens of New-York from the pre&s;ent mode of appointing the chief magi&s;trate! There are no exertions of which they are capable, ab|&s;tractedly con&s;idered from the re&s;t of the &s;tate, by which they can at all effect the mayor. If, as before &s;aid, the city &s;hould continue to &s;end republican repre&s;entatives to the a&s;&s;embly, and by a fortuitous concurrence of cir|cum&s;tances the other parts of the &s;tate &s;hould not, what power have they to remove the mayor however much his removal might be de&s;ired? None. Where then is the liberty of the citizens in this re&s;pect? To &s;ay that men are free when their freedom depends upon the will of others, is as great a contradiction as to &s;ay that the &s;ame thing can be and not be at the &s;ame time. Free|dom con&s;i&s;ts in one man being free from the re&s;traints of others. But in this re&s;pect the citizens are as much bound by the will of the &s;tate, in a matter which, of right, only concerns them&s;elves, as a &s;lave is by the will of his owner: and the influence they have in the appoint|ment of the mayor is little more than if he was appointed by the king of England.</P>
<P>Such a &s;y&s;tem ill accords with ju&s;tice and the political improvements of America. Nor is it con&s;i&s;tent with the wi&s;dom of the legi&s;lature to &s;uffer its continuance.. It peculiarly behoves the pre&s;ent legi&s;lature &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider this &s;ubject. Much indeed depends upon it. Beneficial effects will doubtle&s;s re&s;ult from a change of men at the pre&s;ent juncture. But <HI>permanent</HI> good can only be expected from a radical change in the <HI>system.</HI> Let the legi&s;lature give to the city the right of electing its Chief Magi&s;trate, and by &s;o doing the independance of the citizens and perhaps the freedom of the &s;tate, will be pre&s;erved. This, we repeat, is the only &s;ource from
<PB N="50" REF="037171_0047_100D8CB69A834AE0">
which durable good can be expected. For if from in|attention or any other cau&s;e the republicani&s;m of the &s;tate &s;hould not, at the next &s;e&s;&s;ion, predominate in the a&s;&s;embly, what may be done by this, may be undone by the next legi&s;lature. Whereas if the citizens once po&s;|&s;e&s;s the right of electing the mayor, it would not be an ea&s;y matter at any &s;ub&s;equent period, to wre&s;t it from them.</P>
