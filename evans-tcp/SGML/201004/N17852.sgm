<P>Look not every Man on his own Things, but every Man al&s;o on the Things of Others.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS precept of the Apo&s;tle is plain, and being delivered under the authority of in|&s;piration, is infinitely binding.</P>
<P>THE great duty which it teaches us, is, to regard with a benevolent affection, and to endea|vour to promote with corre&s;pondent engaged|ne&s;s, the temporal, &s;ocial, and &s;piritual intere&s;ts of our fellow men. Though the precept does not prohibit a &s;uitably &s;ubordinate care for our own welfare, &s;o far as it can be con&s;ulted, in con&s;i&s;tency with the claims of benevolence to others; it particularly inculcates, a di&s;intere&s;ted
<PB N="4" REF="023135_0003_0FBC83AF6F4ADF60">concern for, and &s;uitable exertions to advance, as in it&s;elf a di&s;tinct, and de&s;irable object, the good of others. For by the things of others is undoubtedly meant their good, compri&s;ing their external pro&s;perity, their peace, reputation, &s;o|cial comfort, and whatever is ab&s;olutely valua|ble to them. This good of others, as in it&s;elf a valuable object, the Apo&s;tle directs us to con|&s;ult. As the object is of a di&s;intere&s;ted nature, the affection enjoined mu&s;t be di&s;intere&s;ted. From the text then, this doctrine may be fairly drawn, that DISINTERESTED love is at the foundation of the Chri&s;tian character, and ab&s;olutely binding on all mankind.</P>

<P N="1">1. I AM to give you an explanation of what is meant by Di&s;intere&s;ted Love, by exhibiting its na|ture and the manner in which it will operate and expre&s;s it&s;elf. The term di&s;intere&s;ted is not found in the Scriptures. We however make u&s;e of it, to communicate an idea of that love, which our
<PB N="5" REF="023135_0004_0FBC83B2D87BE608">text and many other pa&s;&s;ages of the Bible enjoin, becau&s;e it more conci&s;ely, and more forcibly expre&s;&s;es that idea, than it can be expre&s;&s;ed in any other manner.</P>
<P>DISINTERESTED love may be defined thus, It is a love to an object for what it is in it&s;elf; a di&s;po&s;ition to con&s;ult and rejoice in its good, as an object, ab&s;tractly con&s;idered. It is a bene|volent regard, which one being feels for the good and happine&s;s of another, proportionate to its apparent intrin&s;ic worth and importance, and is a rejoicing in, and &s;eeking the good of that other, without any regard to per&s;onal benefit to be de|rived from it. Di&s;intere&s;ted love is, in its pecu|liar nature the contra&s;t of that which is inter|e&s;ted.</P>
<P>INTERESTED love is a regard to a being merely on account of the benefits he confers, or which are expected from him: &s;o that &s;trictly and pro|perly &s;peaking the being is not loved but his be|nefits. In this, Satan &s;uppo&s;ed the love which Job appeared to exerci&s;e towards GOD con&s;i&s;ted. Satan imagined that Job's dutiful re&s;pect to the DEITY was founded &s;olely on the ble&s;&s;ings with which GOD had favoured him, and that if tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings &s;hould be withdrawn, and GOD &s;hould lay his hand heavy upon him, in a way of cha&s;ti&s;e|ment, Job's apparent love would become extinct, and his enmity ri&s;e to a flame. &s;ee Job 1.9. <Q>Then
<PB N="6" REF="023135_0005_0FBC83B484B39918">Satan an&s;wered the Lord and &s;aid, Doth Job fear GOD for nought? Ha&s;t not thou made an hedge about him and about his hou&s;e, and about all that he hath on every &s;ide? Thou ha&s;t ble&s;&s;ed the work of his hands and his &s;ub|&s;tance is increa&s;ed on every &s;ide. But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will cur&s;e thee to thy face.</Q> This repre&s;en|tation exhibits the love of Job as ultimately mer|cenary and &s;elfi&s;h. Of this nature was that love, which influenced many of tho&s;e who followed our Saviour when they attended him with pro|fe&s;&s;ions of re&s;pect, not becau&s;e they were really attached to Chri&s;t, or the intere&s;ts of his king|dom, but becau&s;e they found their own tempo|ral ends an&s;wered by following him. This is clearly intimated in what Chri&s;t &s;aid to them, <Q>Verily I &s;ay unto you, ye follow me not be|cau&s;e ye &s;aw the miracles, but becau&s;e ye did eat of the loaves and were filled.</Q> This love Chri&s;t &s;peaks of, as common to men in an un&s;anctified &s;tate. He tells us that <Q>they love tho&s;e who love them,</Q> that they do good to tho&s;e who do good to them, and lend to tho&s;e, of whom they hope to receive as much again. Though they have a kind of love, it is not that genuine benevolent affection, which terminates in the good of others. It is of a &s;ini&s;ter nature, and in all its operations and fruits has an ulti|mate
<PB N="7" REF="023135_0006_0FBC83B5FAA5BF88">direction to &s;elf. All the views and aims of tho&s;e whom it governs, center finally in &s;elf. Self is their GOD, their &s;upreme object of regard, in who&s;e &s;ervice all their powers are employed, and their zeal exerted. This love does not refu&s;e to embrace others, &s;o far as they can be con&s;i|dered the in&s;truments of its own gratification, and as &s;ub&s;erving its own &s;elfi&s;h &s;chemes and wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>IT may even lead the &s;ubjects of it to exerci&s;e &s;ome complacency in the DEITY, &s;o far as their imaginations repre&s;ent him in a partial view, and they can con&s;ider him as the author of their plea&s;ures and as invariably con&s;ulting their hap|pine&s;s. But it will go no farther.</P>
<P>ESSENTIALLY and widely different from this, is the di&s;intere&s;ted love which we are endeavour|ing to delienate. Self is not its object or its end. It is an enlarged affection of heart, which looks at the good of others ultimately, and for it&s;elf; under the prevailing influence of which, the &s;ubject of it rejoices, in the exi&s;tence, glory, and happine&s;s of GOD; in the exi&s;tence, exalta|tion and felicity of inferiour intelligents; and in all the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s which is &s;hed abroad, or is yet to be extended through the univer&s;e. In|fluenced by this love, he rejoices in the triumphs of redeeming grace, wi&s;hes for the be&s;t good of all around him, even of his bittere&s;t enemies,
<PB N="8" REF="023135_0007_0FBC83B719145D48">and feels a &s;en&s;ible plea&s;ure in every in&s;tance of the advancement of their temporal, &s;ocial, and &s;piritual intere&s;ts; without taking into con&s;ide|ration any &s;uppo&s;ed good to be derived from thence to him&s;elf. Indeed &s;o ardently does he de&s;ire, and &s;o highly does he value this good of the DEITY and of his fellow creatures, that he takes his chief &s;atisfaction in it. And &s;o far is he from regarding others as only &s;ub&s;ervient to his own intere&s;ts, that he is willing to give up his own intere&s;t for the greater good of others. In eve|ry bo&s;om, in which this love has the a&s;cenden|cy, it will operate and expre&s;s it&s;elf in a con&s;ci|entious obedience to all duty, at the hazard of reputation, property, and life.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to GOD the &s;upreme object of it, it will operate in a cordial complacency in his character as in it&s;elf infinitely amiable and ex|cellent. For a benevolent creature cannot but love a being perfectly benevolent, and <HI>GOD is Love.</HI> It will operate in a &s;incere veneration of the divine government as a government uniform|ly equitable, and embracing in its nature and i&s;|&s;ue the mo&s;t noble and benevolent objects. View|ing the divine admini&s;tration as a &s;y&s;tem of ho|line&s;s, and con&s;piring to &s;ecure the greate&s;t glo|ry and happine&s;s of the intelligent creation, the benevolent &s;ubject of this love will frequently, and devoutly adopt the language of in&s;piration,
<PB N="9" REF="023135_0008_0FBC83B8708D42A0"><Q>The Lord reigneth let the earth rejoice, let the multitude of the i&s;les be glad thereof,</Q> and join the rapturous &s;ong of the Redeemed, <Q>Alle|luiah, for the Lord GOD omnipotent reigneth.</Q></P>
<P>THIS love will operate in an acquie&s;cence in the decrees of GOD; in the providential allot|ments of GOD, and make the happy &s;ubject of it willing to be in the hand of GOD, as clay in the hand of the Potter. For if the divine go|vernment in its execution, be a proper object of benevolent acquie&s;cence and joy, then it mu&s;t reflect higher honour upon the DEITY, to have planned it from Eternity, than to have &s;tumbled upon it by any fortunate contingence. And if GOD be infinitely lovely, as a holy and benevolent Being, then it mu&s;t be grateful to every good man, that all things are at his di&s;po&s;al.</P>
<P>FURTHER, this love will lead the &s;ubject of it to &s;ub&s;cribe to the divine laws, as holy, ju&s;t, and good; becau&s;e they are calculated not only to &s;ecure the greate&s;t good of the univer&s;e, but the temporal and eternal happine&s;s of every one who obeys them.</P>
<P>THE man who is under the influence of this di&s;intere&s;ted affection, will embrace objects ac|cording to their worth and importance. He will &s;eek the divine glory as dearer to him than any of his own intere&s;ts. He will be chearfully di&s;|po&s;ed to con&s;ecrate his all to this glorious ob|ject,
<PB N="10" REF="023135_0009_0FBC83BC0AD3E578">and to lay him&s;elf, with all his intere&s;ts for time and for eternity at the feet of his Maker; and if his own welfare interfere with the great and benevolent ends of the divine govern|ment, he will be willing to &s;acrifice &s;o &s;mall a trifle, rather than tho&s;e ends &s;hould be fru&s;|trated.</P>
<P>THIS love will expre&s;s it&s;elf in the outward obedience of a pious and u&s;eful life. He in who&s;e bo&s;om it reigns, will endeavour to ho|nour GOD by an adherence to his wor&s;hip, his in&s;titutions and cau&s;e at whatever expence. He will be &s;trictly careful to refrain from all acts of impiety as di&s;honorary to GOD, and injurious in their tendency. He will ardently pray for, and by actual exertion endeavour to be in&s;trumental in the advancement of the Go&s;pel of the Son of GOD, as a &s;y&s;tem of grace and happine&s;s; and nothing will give him &s;o much plea&s;ure, as to hear of the conver&s;ion of &s;ouls, and the progre&s;s of grace in the hearts of men.</P>
<P>TOWARDS men, this love reigning in the heart of a true chri&s;tian, will be a fountain of beneficent actions. It will incline him to acts of forbearance and forgivene&s;s towards his enemies, to be tender of the reputation, peace and out|ward pro&s;perity of all tho&s;e with whom he is a&s;|&s;ociated in dome&s;tic and civil &s;ociety, or in the bonds of the Go&s;pel, and to maintain a harmle&s;s
<PB N="11" REF="023135_0010_0FBC83BDD8BF28C8">deportment. It will not prompt him to reproach and calumny. It will not allow him to wi&s;h to build up his own temporal intere&s;ts on the ruin of the reputation or property of another. He will con&s;ider the peace and &s;ocial happine&s;s of his neighbour as dear to him, and will be &s;oli|citous not to di&s;turb them. He will be happy to &s;ee them promoted and will rather &s;uffer him|&s;elf than be the in&s;trument of his &s;uffering.</P>
<P>FARTHER, he will be active in po&s;itive exer|tions to do good. His hand will be open to relieve the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. The hungry, the naked, the widow and the orphan; the family of &s;ickne&s;s and affliction, will be the objects of his tender|ne&s;s and charity. He will &s;ympathize with them under their affliction, and it will afford him &s;ol|id &s;atisfaction to contribute to their relief. He will love the plea&s;ing conde&s;cen&s;ion of communi|cating council or in&s;truction to them, or in any way promoting their felicity. The good of the pub|lic, of u&s;eful &s;ocieties, and in&s;titutions he will en|deavour to advance; and above all, the eternal &s;alvation of his fellow creatures, as that is by far the mo&s;t important of all other &s;ocial objects, and in it&s;elf infinitely de&s;irable, he will ardent|ly pray for, and to this will his exertions, his coun&s;els, his per&s;ua&s;ions and his example be chief|ly directed.</P>
<P>IF it &s;hould be a&s;ked whether this love to others,
<PB N="12" REF="023135_0011_0FBC83BF9D8E2980">and regard to their welfare, does not connect with it &s;en&s;ible plea&s;ure, and whether therefore it can be properly termed a di&s;intere&s;ted affec|tion?</P>
<P>I WOULD an&s;wer. There can be no que&s;tion, but that the love which we have been de&s;cribing, brings with it, its own reward. It e&s;&s;entially involves in it a plea&s;ure of the mo&s;t exalted kind. There is a &s;olid joy attending it, which is unde|&s;cribably &s;weet. Yea, the benevolent man's happine&s;s lies in the happine&s;s of others, and the more his heart expands with the love of GOD and his fellow creatures, the more happy he is. But this is the <HI>effect</HI> of the affection; not the <HI>motive</HI> or <HI>object</HI> of it. The good man does not &s;eek his neighbour's happine&s;s that he may enjoy the plea&s;ure of &s;eeking it. This would be contradictory. For, were this the ca&s;e, his neighbour would not be loved at all in fact, only as an in&s;trument of his plea&s;|ure. Di&s;intere&s;ted love terminates not in per&s;onal enjoyment, but in the good of others. The man who is the &s;ubject of it, regards the good and happine&s;s of others ultimately. And though he feels the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible plea&s;ure in the exerci&s;e of his affection, and though it conduces directly to the &s;ecurity of his hige&s;t pre&s;ent and eternal intere&s;ts, this is by no means the motive or object of it, but its &s;pontaneous effect and
<PB N="13" REF="023135_0012_0FBC83C10AC23238">fruit. And when we &s;peak of di&s;intere&s;ted love, we have reference merely to the object.</P>
<P>IF any &s;hould a&s;k &s;till farther, whether by di&s;intere&s;ted love be meant, &s;uch an entire and ab&s;tracted regard to the good of others, as im|plies a total di&s;regard to, and indifference about our own <HI>good?</HI></P>
<P>IT may be an&s;wered, that di&s;intere&s;ted love, &s;trictly &s;peaking, has no ultimate re&s;pect what|ever to &s;elf, as &s;elf. But while we contend for this, we do not mean to contend for it, to the total ex|clu&s;ion of all regard to our own private good. A &s;ubordinate, an impartial, a di&s;intere&s;ted con|cern for our own happine&s;s, is con&s;i&s;tent with a di&s;intere&s;ted and &s;uperior regard to the greater good of others, and di&s;intere&s;ted love will not give up or di&s;regard the former when it can be con&s;ulted in con&s;i&s;tency with the latter. Di&s;in|tere&s;ted love, being ab&s;olutely impartial in it nature, cannot lead a man to an indifferency re|&s;pecting his own private happine&s;s, but to value it, ju&s;t as he would the happine&s;s of another in &s;imilar circum&s;tances, and ju&s;t as another per&s;on, di&s;connected from him, and viewing things im|partially, would value it. And there can be no doubt but that &s;aints and angels in heaven, who exerci&s;e a perfectly di&s;intere&s;ted and &s;upreme re|gard to the glory of GOD, and the good of other intelligents, have al&s;o at the &s;ame time a real,
<PB N="14" REF="023135_0013_0FBC83C240A94408">though a perfectly impartial, &s;ubordinate, and va&s;tly inferior value for their own happine&s;s.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hence the manner of expre&s;&s;ion which the Apo&s;tle u&s;es in the text, "But every man <HI>al&s;o</HI> on the things of others," is &s;o far from millitating as &s;ome in&s;inuate, again&s;t the doctrine of di&s;in|tere&s;ted love, that it rather corroborates it. For while it im|plicitly teaches, that it is our duty to entertain a due regard to our own happine&s;s, it teaches, that that regard mu&s;t be imparti|al or di&s;intere&s;ted, &s;o as to admit a due benevolence to others.</NOTE> Subordinate, I &s;ay, for di&s;intere&s;ted love will never allow private, per&s;onal intere&s;ts to inter|fere with the public, and more exten&s;ive good.</P>
<P>HAVING briefly &s;hown you what is meant by di&s;intere&s;ted love, and illu&s;trated the manner in which it will operate and expre&s;s it&s;elf. I pro|ceed</P>
<P N="2">II. To prove the doctrine, that &s;uch di&s;inter|e&s;ted love is at the foundation of the chri&s;tian character and ab&s;olutely binding on all man|kind.</P>
<P>THIS part of the &s;ubject, &s;eems to divide it&s;elf into two branches.</P>
<P N="1">I. LET us con&s;ider the proof which may be produced to evince, that di&s;intere&s;ted love is at the foundation of the chri&s;tian character. When I &s;ay it is at the foundation of the chri&s;tian cha|racter, I mean, that it is e&s;&s;ential to all evangel|ical obedience, &s;o that without it there can be no genuine renovation of nature, or any &s;aving conformity to the the Go&s;pel. And in proof of this propo&s;ition, let it be ob&s;erved,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="15" REF="023135_0014_0FBC83C3B69B6A78">
I. THAT di&s;intere&s;ted love is the love which the &s;um of the moral law requires. <Q>Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy GOD, with all thy heart, and withall thy &s;oul, and with all thy &s;trength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thy&s;elf.</Q> In this &s;ummary view of the moral law, the objects of love are, GOD, and our neighbour. In them our love is to terminate. They are to be loved ultimately as objects in them&s;elves con&s;idered, di&s;connected from any &s;elfi&s;h intere&s;ts of ours, and without any con&s;ide|rations whether that love in its nature or i&s;&s;ue will conduce to our own per&s;onal benefit or not. The command is unconditional and po&s;itive, in no mea&s;ure &s;u&s;pended on the condition of its con|tributing to our advantage. And if the affection required, did not produce to us the lea&s;t degree of enjoyment for the pre&s;ent, or if there were no promi&s;es of future reward made to it, the command would &s;till be ab&s;olutely binding.</P>
<P>IT cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that this command obliges us to love GOD only &s;o far as he admi|ni&s;ters to our enjoyment; and that the moment he counteracts our happine&s;s, even though it be in perfect ju&s;tice, he forfeits all claim to our affec|tion: This would, even by divine con&s;titution make &s;elf, the &s;upreme and ultimate object of re|gard. This would make us re&s;pect the DEITY only as &s;ub&s;ervient to our wi&s;hes, and would be
<PB N="16" REF="023135_0015_0FBC83C531240C30">a requi&s;ition of no love to him at all. It would totally preclude on his part all claim to &s;upreme homage, and complacency.</P>
<P>NOR can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that the command obliging us to love our <HI>neighbour,</HI> has an ulti|mate reference to our own happine&s;s, and is &s;u&s;|pended on the condition of its conducing to it. This would involve a &s;imilar ab&s;urdity. GOD and our neighbour are therefore the expre&s;s and ul|timate objects, to whom our love is directed in this &s;ummary of the divine law. And the rea&s;on of this is obvious.</P>
<P>WE are under infinite obligations to love the ble&s;&s;ed GOD for what he is in him&s;elf, on ac|count of the infinite worth of his exi&s;tence, glo|ry, and happine&s;s; and the infinite amiablene&s;s of his character. So ab&s;olutely perfect, excellent, and amiable is that a&s;&s;emblage of divine attributes, with which the DEITY is clothed; &s;o altogether equitable and benevolent his government, and &s;o wi&s;e his laws and di&s;pen&s;ations, that it is impo&s;|&s;ible but that every intelligent creature, be his per&s;onal circum&s;tances and pro&s;pects what they may, &s;hould be under obligations to love him with all their powers, and to rejoice in him as GOD over all ble&s;&s;ed for ever.&mdash;</P>
<P>AND we cannot but be bound to love our neighbour, and in the exerci&s;e of that love to &s;eek his welfare; becau&s;e his exi&s;tence and hap|pine&s;s
<PB N="17" REF="023135_0016_0FBC83C8F635B750">are in them&s;elves of great worth and im|portance.</P>
<P>DISINTERESTED love then, is the love which the moral law &s;ummarily requires. It is the e&s;|&s;ence of holine&s;s and of all obedience. But the &s;cripture expre&s;&s;ly a&s;&s;ures us, "that <HI>without</HI> holi|ne&s;s no man can &s;ee the Lord;" That it is vain to call Chri&s;t Lord, Lord, while we do not the things which he requires; that the unrighteous mall not inherit the kingdom of GOD; and that tho&s;e who are peculiarly GOD'S people, have his law put into their hearts. The undeniable con|&s;equence is, that di&s;intere&s;ted love is at the foundation of the chri&s;tian character.</P>
<P N="2">II. THE &s;on of GOD has decidedly made the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his &s;pirit, and an imitation of his example, not only our duty, but ab&s;olutely e&s;|&s;ential to our &s;aving intere&s;t in him. <Q>If any man have not the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t he is none of his. This is my commandment, that ye love one another, <HI>as I have loved you,</HI> and he that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me.

That in this a&s;toni&s;hing exhibition of love and goodne&s;s, he ultimately regarded &s;elfi&s;h objects?

No. It is a fervent charity of heart, which &s;ought not its own. It is the charming dignity of an unfeign|ed, and &s;pontaneous benevolence, totally re|moved from any thing of a &s;elfi&s;h nature; a benevolence &s;tronger than death, and which &s;u&s;|tained the illu&s;trious &s;ufferer, through &s;uch a &s;cene of humiliation, as the univer&s;e never be|held. Attend candidly to the mere language of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, and you cannot, you will not di&s;pute it. Con&s;ider the a&s;pect of his life, and the hi&s;tory of his atonement. Give impartial credit to the te&s;timony of in&s;pired truth, and you will acknowledge that it was an ardent, di&s;intere&s;ted love, which ultimately re&s;pected his father's honour, the happine&s;s of the univer&s;e, and the &s;alvation of precious &s;ouls, which car|ried the divine Je&s;us to mount Calvary, which has gone with him to heaven, and which will for ever burn in his bo&s;om, as a perpetual and inextingui&s;hable flame.</P>
<P>NOW as the members mu&s;t be of the &s;ame nature with the head, as the branches mu&s;t par|take of the e&s;&s;ential qualities of the vine, the con&s;equence follows, that di&s;intere&s;ted love is at the foundation of the Chri&s;tian character, and e&s;&s;ential to all &s;aving conformity to the Go&s;pel.</P>

III. THE examples of the Apo&s;tles, may be produced as additional te&s;timony in demon&s;tra|tion of the doctrine before us. The Apo&s;tles ex|pre&s;&s;ed in their public preaching, and the lead|ing actions of their lives, not a &s;ordid, narrow &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, which ultimately re&s;pected their own intere&s;ts either temporal or eternal; but a di&s;in|tere&s;ted regard to the honour of their ma&s;ter, and the highe&s;t happine&s;s of their fellow men. That they were under the government of this noble propen&s;ity of &s;oul, they gave undeniable proof, in their voluntary renunciation of their worldly ea&s;e and temporal pro&s;pects, and their uniform &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to every kind of &s;ufferings, for the furtherance of the Go&s;pel. Hence &s;ays St. Paul, "We &s;eek not yours but you." and again, <Q>Even as I plea&s;e all men, in all things, not &s;eeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be &s;aved.</Q></P>
<P>NOW holine&s;s is the &s;ame throughout every part of the univer&s;e. The &s;pirit of Chri&s;t's kingdom is but one. This only is the proper ba&s;is of that union &s;poken of by Chri&s;t, <Q>That they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, that they al&s;o may be one in us, I in them, and thou in me, that they al&s;o may be perfect in one, and that the world may know that thou ha&s;t loved them, as thou ha&s;t loved me.</Q> Is not here then, my brethren, unque&s;|tionable
<PB N="21" REF="023135_0020_0FBC83CF49ED32E0">proof of the propo&s;ition before us?&mdash;</P>
<P N="4">IV. FARTHER evidence in &s;upport of the doctrine, that di&s;intere&s;ted love is e&s;&s;ential to the chri&s;tian character, may be produced from many pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, which explicitly e&s;tabli&s;h it. To this purpo&s;e, you will &s;uffer me to reque&s;t your attention to the following. Matt. v. 44. <Q>But I &s;ay unto you, love your enemies. Ble&s;s them that cur&s;e you. Do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that de&s;pitefully u&s;e you and per&s;ecute you. Luke vi. 31. "And as ye would that men &s;hould do to you, do ye even &s;o to them. For if ye love them which love you, what thank have you? For &s;inners al&s;o love tho&s;e that love them. And if ye lend to tho&s;e of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? For &s;inners al&s;o lend to &s;inners to receive as much again. But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, <HI>hoping for nothing again,</HI> and your reward &s;hall be great, and ye &s;hall be the children of the highe&s;t, for he is kind unto the unthankful, and to the evil.</Q></P>
<P>THE love here enjoined, as con&s;tituting the di&s;tingui&s;hing character of Chri&s;t's di&s;ciples, is certainly of a di&s;intere&s;ted nature. Self-intere&s;t is not the &s;pring of it. We are enjoined to do good without any re&s;pect to per&s;onal advantage, from a mere principle of loving to do good,
<PB N="22" REF="023135_0021_0FBC83D06ECD9140">even to tho&s;e whom our &s;elfi&s;h affections natu|rally prompt us to hate and injure. And le&s;t we &s;hould imagine that this love was not e&s;&s;en|tial to the chri&s;tian character, Chri&s;t repeatedly a&s;&s;ures us, that if we have it not, and do not act from the influence of it, we are no better than publicans and &s;inners. Corre&s;pondent to which, are the words of Chri&s;t. Luke 14.26. <Q>If any man come to me and hate not his father and mother, and wife, and children and bre|thren, and &s;i&s;ters, yea, and his own life al&s;o, he cannot be my di&s;ciple.</Q> i.e. If a man have not that di&s;intere&s;ted love to me and my kingdom, which &s;hall di&s;po&s;e him to a vol|untary &s;acrifice of his own private intere&s;ts for my &s;ake, and for the &s;ake of the Go&s;pel, he be|longs to the kingdom of my great enemy, and cannot be admitted to a &s;hare in tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, which I will be&s;tow on all, who truly take up their cro&s;s, and follow me. To the &s;ame in|port, and enjoining the &s;ame thing, are the words of the Apo&s;tle. 1 Cor. 10. 24. <Q>Let no man &s;eek his own, but every man another's wealth.</Q> In the &s;ame manner he &s;peaks of that charity, the nature of which he particular|ly delineates in 1 Cor. 13 ch. and of which he &s;ays, <Q>Though I have the gift of prophecy, and under&s;tand all my&s;teries, and all knowl|edge; and though I have all faith, &s;o that I
<PB N="23" REF="023135_0022_0FBC83D39FDE10D8">could remove mountains, and have no chari|ty, I am nothing. And though I be&s;tow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing;</Q> and, which he &s;ays in another place, <Q>is the fulfilling of the law;</Q> of this charity, he gives this di&s;|tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tic, <Q>&s;he &s;eeketh nother own.</Q> Hence he reprobates the oppo&s;ite principle of &s;inners, as repugnant to the &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity. "For I have no man," &s;ays he in his epi&s;tle to the Ephe&s;ians. <Q>like-minded, who will naturally care for your &s;tate, for all &s;eek their own, not the things which are Je&s;us Chri&s;t's.</Q></P>
<P>ADDRESSING his &s;on Timothy on the peril|ous times that were to come, he &s;peaks of this, as one of the greate&s;t evils that &s;hould attend them, <Q>For men &s;hall be lovers of their <HI>own|&s;elves.</HI> </Q> I need not comment on the&s;e pa&s;|&s;ages, becau&s;e they expre&s;sly teach the doctrine we are now &s;upporting. They unequivocally a&s;&s;ert, that di&s;intere&s;ted love is at the foundation of the chri&s;tian character, or they teach no|thing, they are perfectly unintelligible, and noth|ing can be under&s;tood from the &s;acred volume.</P>
<P>BUT it is time for me to proceed to the other branch of the doctrine, and to &s;how that di&s;in|tere&s;ted love is binding on all mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="023135_0023_0FBC83D4FA190430">
AFTER what has been advanced to prove, that it is e&s;&s;ential to the chri&s;tian character, much need not be &s;aid to demon&s;trate, that as the e&s;&s;ence of duty, it is obligatory upon men of all de&s;criptions. For &s;urely, all mankind are bound to the &s;ame obedience, which the true chri&s;tian renders. If di&s;intere&s;ted love was the actuating principle in the Redeemer of the world, if it was the grand impelling affection in the in&s;pired Apo&s;tles, and if it was taught to Chri&s;t's followers, by &s;uch numerous precepts, as <HI>that</HI> charity without which they could be no|thing, then its univer&s;al obligation is indubita|ble.</P>
<P>BUT that it may be rendered, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till more indi&s;putable, &s;uffer me to make &s;ome ad|ditional ob&s;ervations from the nature of things, and from the expre&s;s commands of GOD re&s;pect|ing it.</P>
<P N="1">I. IT is obvious from the nature of things, that all mankind are bound to exerci&s;e this di&s;|intere&s;ted love, and to act in all the tran&s;actions of life from the governing influence of it. Can it be rea&s;onable that &s;elf &s;hould be the object of our &s;upreme and ultimate regard? Can it be right that all our &s;olicitude and concern &s;hould center on mere per&s;onal intere&s;ts? Can it be ju&s;t for us to view our little &s;elves as of &s;uch mighty importance, as to entertain no re|gard
<PB N="25" REF="023135_0024_0FBC83D67A6762B0">for other beings, only as they contribute to our felicity, and are &s;ub&s;ervient to our purpo&s;es? What are we! creatures of a day, who&s;e breath is in our no&s;trils, who hang upon our Makers en|ergy; what are we, that we &s;hould be the &s;ole ob|jects of our own regard? Of what little compa|rative con&s;equence are we and our intere&s;ts, in the &s;cale of being? What mighty lo&s;s would the Univer&s;e &s;u&s;tain if we were &s;truck out of it? Is not the exi&s;tence and glory of GOD, of infinitely more worth and value, than any intere&s;ts of ours? Is not the good, the happine&s;s of the moral Crea|tion of far, yea, of inconceiveably greater con|&s;equence than ours? And is not the happine&s;s of an individual of our fellow creatures, of as much worth as our own happine&s;s? For a man then to love him&s;elf &s;upremely and &s;olely, is it not to make an idol of &s;elf, and to rai&s;e him&s;elf in his own views and e&s;teem, far above the infinite Cre|ator, and the ho&s;ts of intelligent creatures? Is it not in effect to place all beings as pro&s;trate at his own feet? And what is this, but a wicked, ba&s;e contempt of the infinite GOD, and other beings, re|pugnant to the plaine&s;t dictates of rea&s;on and com|mon &s;en&s;e!</P>
<P>EVERY object de&s;erves love and regard in pro|portion to its intrin&s;ic worth and excellence. Hence the Deity has a claim to more regard than the whole Univer&s;e of creatures. And the good of the collective body of intelligent creatures, is of va&s;tly more worth and importance than ours. And the exi&s;tence and happine&s;s of a fellow creature, be|ing of as much worth and importance, have a claim to as much benevolent regard. It is this di&s;intere&s;t|ed benevolence, this ardent diffu&s;ive love my bre|thren, which links holy beings in heaven together, into one perfect harmonious whole. Were &s;elf|i&s;hne&s;s
<PB N="26" REF="023135_0025_0FBC83D82F439C00">to reign among them, it would produce uni|ver&s;al jar, animo&s;ity, and ruin. It is a ba&s;e narrow &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, which is at the foundation of the wars, tumults, rival&s;hips, envying, and bickering of the pre&s;ent &s;inful world. Were men to con&s;ult the good and happine&s;s of each other as much as they do their own, the felicity of paradi&s;e would be re|&s;tored. Selfi&s;hne&s;s then, is the &s;ubver&s;ion of all or|der, propriety and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT that all men are under obligations to exer|ci&s;e this di&s;intere&s;ted affection to other beings, is put out of all di&s;pute by the particular, and per|emptory injunctions of the Deity. <Q>Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy GOD, with all thy &s;oul, and with all thy &s;trength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbour as thy&s;elf.</Q> This is the &s;ummary of the divine law, given by the authority of GOD, and enforced by the mo&s;t awful &s;anctions. And it has been &s;hown that di&s;intere&s;ted love is the love here enjoined. <Q>Look not every man on his own things, but every man al&s;o on the things of <HI>others.</HI> But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again. Let no man &s;eek his own, but every man anothers wealth.</Q> The&s;e are expre&s;s commands of the living GOD. They enjoin the love we have been de&s;cribing, and <Q>cur&s;ed be he who&s;oever continueth not in all things writ|ten in the book of the law to do them.</Q></P>
<P>I AM now to an&s;wer one or two objections to the foregoing doctrines.</P>
<P>I. The pa&s;&s;age of the Apo&s;tle in Heb. xii. 2. is &s;ometimes mentioned as an objection to the doct|rine of di&s;intere&s;ted love, <Q>Looking unto Je&s;us the author and fini&s;her of our faith, who <HI>for the joy that was &s;et before him</HI> endured the cro&s;s, de&s;pi&s;ing the &s;hame, and is &s;et down at the right hand of the throne of GOD.</Q> The objection from this pa&s;&s;age
<PB N="27" REF="023135_0026_0FBC83D9C4129658">&s;uppo&s;eth, that the joy which was &s;et before Chri&s;t was an intere&s;ted object; that it was an additional joy, or felicity, to which as a per&s;onal acqui&s;ition, he had ultimate re&s;pect. It &s;uppo&s;eth that the great end, which Chri&s;t had in view was his own advan|tage, the advancement of his own happine&s;s. But is it true, that the &s;on of GOD was influenced, ulti|mately by &s;elfi&s;h motives, in that &s;cene of humilia|tion and &s;ufferings, which Chri&s;tians are wont to contemplate with &s;o much admiration? Was this the nature of that joy which was &s;et before Chri&s;t? Was it mere per&s;onal enjoyment? Was it not on the other hand a <HI>benevolent joy,</HI> the joy of &s;eeing, as the re&s;ult of his &s;ufferings and death, his Father eminently and eternally glorified; was it not the joy of &s;eeing the empire of happine&s;s extended, the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of the univer&s;e augmented, and milli|ons of precious &s;ouls delivered from &s;in and endle&s;s torments, and rai&s;ed to the enjoyment of immortal glory? Well might the benevolent heart of Chri&s;t rejoice in the pro&s;pect of this inconceivable good. This I venture to &s;ay was the joy which was &s;et be|fore Chri&s;t. This it was which made him &s;o nobly endure the cro&s;s, and de&s;pi&s;e the &s;hame. It was a joy purely di&s;intere&s;ted. And for any one to &s;ay, that it was what the objection &s;uppo&s;eth, that Chri&s;t was ultimately &s;elfi&s;h, in his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to death, is to advance a po&s;ition, which militates with all the repre&s;entations of the Go&s;pel, which ob&s;cures the glory of the Saviour and perverts one of the no|ble&s;t pa&s;&s;ages in the &s;acred volume.</P>
<P N="2">II. Another objection to the doctrine of di&s;inter|e&s;ted love, is drawn from what is &s;aid of Mo&s;es in the xi Chap. of Hebrews 26 ver&s;e, <Q>E&s;teeming the reproach of Chri&s;t greater riches, than the trea&s;ures in Egypt, <HI>for he had re&s;pect unto the re|compence of the reward.</HI></Q> The objection rai&s;ed
<GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="29" REF="023135_0027_0FBC83DC49B375A0">as it is delineated in the holy Bible, is of &s;o uniform|ly a di&s;intere&s;ted complexion, that it of it&s;elf fully refutes the objection without any comment.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now clo&s;e what has been &s;aid with an IMPROVEMENT.</P>
<P N="1">I. From what has been exhibited we infer, that tho&s;e are guilty of a great and very pernicious er|ror, who deny the exi&s;tence of di&s;intere&s;ted love, and our obligations to the exerci&s;e of it.</P>
<P>FROM what has been advanced in this di&s;cour&s;e, it is obvious; that di&s;intere&s;ted love is the &s;ub&s;tance of all duty, and of all moral beauty. It is the fulfil|ing of the fir&s;t, and &s;econd commandments of the law. It is the great bond of harmony and happi|ne&s;s in the heavenly world, and without it, there cannot po&s;&s;ibly exi&s;t in the heart of man, any real conformity to that glorious example of love and goodne&s;s, which is &s;et us in the Go&s;pel. Tho&s;e therefore who deny this, as e&s;&s;ential to the chri&s;ti|an character, and binding on every man, do in ef|fect deny all religion, they take the part of infide|lity, and convert the whole glorious &s;y&s;tem of Go&s;|pel duty into a &s;cheme of mere &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">II. From our &s;ubject we learn, that human de|pravity is radically founded in &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s. Di&s;in|tere&s;ted love is the &s;ub&s;tance of that holine&s;s which is required of us. Of cour&s;e &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s mu&s;t be the &s;ub&s;tance of that rebellion for which we are con|demned. This is the idolatry which GOD will pu|ni&s;h with inextingui&s;hable burnings. Sinners hate GOD becau&s;e he &s;tands in the way of their &s;elfi&s;h propen&s;ities; becau&s;e he will not let the wicked go unpuni&s;hed. They hate his government and laws; becau&s;e they care for nothing but their own &s;elfi&s;h objects, and becau&s;e the government and laws of GOD cla&s;h with tho&s;e objects. And if we will impartially examine the principles of human
<PB N="30" REF="023135_0028_0FBC83DFF6E7BD88">intercour&s;e, we &s;hall find that &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s is the foundation of all tho&s;e moral di&s;orders, which di&s;|turb &s;ociety. Men are envious, revengful, cove|jous, fraudulent, treacherous, thievi&s;h, debauch|ed, becau&s;e they love their own intere&s;ts, and plea|&s;ures more than the reputation, peace and happi|ne&s;s of their neighbours.</P>
<P N="3">III. OUR &s;ubject affords this inference, that all external performances of a religious a&s;pect, which re&s;ult from motives of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, con&s;ti|tute no real obedience, and do not enter inot the nature of that holine&s;s, without which no man &s;hall &s;ee GOD. If on the &s;uppo&s;ition of be|ing de&s;titute of that charity which &s;eeketh not her own, St. Paul could &s;ay, though I &s;peak with the tongue of men and angels, I am no|thing. And though I give all my goods to feed the poor, and my body to be burned, it profit|eth me nothing; then certainly, whatever ex|ternal performances re&s;ult not from this princi|ple within, are mere dro&s;s, and no proper or acceptable compliance with the divine law what|ever.</P>
<P>IF a man &s;hould &s;erve his country with ever &s;o much external diligence and activity, though his &s;ervice in it&s;elf might e&s;&s;entially contribute to the public good; yet, if it all were the re|&s;ult of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and dictated by motives of &s;elf-intere&s;t, not by a &s;uperiour regard to the divine glory and the good of men, it would be nothing in the divine account. Were a man to contribute ever &s;o largely to the relief of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, yet if it be done through an ulti|mate regard to his own private ends, and not from di&s;intere&s;ted motives, it would be nothing. Hence &s;ays Chri&s;t, <Q>When thou doe&s;t thine alms, do not found a trumpet before thee, as
<PB N="31" REF="023135_0029_0FBC83E181A0BF80">the hypocrites do in the &s;ynagogues, and in the corners of the &s;treets, that they may have glory of men Verily I &s;ay unto you, They have their reward. But when thou do&s;t alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth.</Q> If men externally fa&s;t and pray ever &s;o con&s;tantly, yet if &s;elf is the &s;pring of their apparent duty, it enters not into the nature of obedience. Therefore &s;ays the apo&s;tle James, <Q>Ye a&s;k and ye receive not, becau&s;e ye a&s;k ami&s;s, that ye may con&s;ume it upon your lu&s;ts.</Q> Hence the precept, <Q>Whether there|fore, ye eat or drink, or whatever ye do, do all to the glory of GOD.</Q></P>
<P N="4">IV. OUR &s;ubject teaches us, that the thou|&s;and years reign of Chri&s;t on earth, in the emi|nent enlargement and glory of the Church, pre|dicted by &s;cripture prophecy, will be attended with un&s;peakable glory and happine&s;s. In&s;pired truth predicts, that the earth &s;hall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, even as the waters co|ver the &s;ea; that the time &s;hall come, when Satan &s;hall be bound for a thou&s;and years, and not be &s;uffered to deceive the nations any more till tho&s;e thou&s;and years &s;hall be fulfilled; when the kingdoms of this world, &s;hall become the kingdom of our Lord, and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t; when many &s;hall run to and fro, and knowledge &s;hall be increa&s;|ed; and when all &s;hall know GOD, from the great|e&s;t unto the lea&s;t; and the nations of the world &s;hall beat their &s;words into plough-&s;hares, and their &s;pears into pruning hooks, and &s;hall learn war no more. Such a ble&s;&s;ed period has not yet gladened this &s;inful di&s;tracted world. It is therefore yet to come. It is advancing as fa&s;t as the wheels of time roll round, and probably it is not far di&s;tant. What glory my brethern will di&s;tingui&s;h this illu|&s;trious
<PB N="32" REF="023135_0030_0FBC83E3EC9B8288">&s;cene! Here will be the reign of holine&s;s, and holine&s;s is love. Di&s;intere&s;ted love will here erect her throne, and extend her benign and &s;alutary way. The &s;elfish propen&s;ities will give way to the milder and more peaceful influence of imparti|al affection. Hence frauds, treacheries and rapine will cea&s;e, and mankind will live together as bre|thren, anticipating in the grateful fervour of their love to GOD and one another, the undi&s;turbed feli|city of that world, where love will be perfect and interminable.</P>
<P N="5">V. Let me clo&s;e, by calling upon you all, my chri&s;tian brethern and fellow &s;inners, in the name of that GOD who is love, to exerci&s;e and uniformly to act from the influence of that love which is the fulfilling of the law. If ye live de&s;titute of this ho|ly affection, as the &s;upreme and governing princi|ple of your &s;ouls, ye will be cumberers of the ground, ye will live under the cur&s;e of your ma|ker, and at la&s;t lie down in &s;orrow. If that charity which &s;eeketh not her own have the a&s;cendency in your hearts, and transfu&s;e it&s;elf in your lives, ye will re&s;emble the divine Philanthropi&s;t, who died for us. You will live u&s;efully and happily; you will leave the world in triumph, and heaven will be your re&s;idence forever. Now to GOD only wi&s;e and our Saviour, be glory and dominion Amen.</P>
