<P>Verily every Man at his be&s;t &s;tate is altoge|ther Vanity.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE words are very plain, and very full, and very mortifying. Man, a noble and rea&s;onable creature, of a curious body and an immortal &s;pirit, may he not be a little proud of his talents, his capacities, his enjoyments, and his rever|&s;ions?&mdash;No; he is an empty and a brittle thing: <HI>Man is vanity.</HI>&mdash;Yes, <HI>&s;ome men:</HI> perhaps the gene|rality. But are there not others exempted from the character? The wi&s;e, the learned, the rich and no|ble, the beautiful and &s;trong; per&s;ons of wide fame or high authority, princes and emperors at the head of mankind, are the&s;e &s;o too? Yes; <HI>every man</HI> is vanity.&mdash;<HI>Sometimes</HI> perhaps, in &s;ome circum&s;tances
<PB N="4" REF="008809_0003_102FF0390B2F9DF0">and at &s;ome certain &s;ea&s;ons: But not in his faire&s;t appearance, and brighte&s;t glory. The king &s;ick, or the &s;cholar a&s;leep may be &s;o: but is the rich in the mid&s;t of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, the general at the head of his army.&mdash;Yes, every man at his <HI>be&s;t e&s;tate</HI> is vanity.&mdash; Allow men; <HI>all</HI> men, and all men in their <HI>be&s;t e&s;tate,</HI> are <HI>vain:</HI> a little vain it may be. Nay, <HI>vanity</HI> it&s;elf, in the ab&s;tract. Well, granted, in a <HI>few</HI> things, per|haps in many: But &s;ure the idea may &s;top here. Nay he is <HI>altogether vanity.</HI> The&s;e are a&s;&s;ertions perhaps: a bear <HI>hypothe&s;is:</HI> a &s;peculation only, not well ground|ed. A topick of amu&s;ement or di&s;pute, but not demon&s;trated conclu&s;ion.&mdash;Nay, it is mo&s;t certainly &s;o. <HI>Verily</HI> every man at his be&s;t e&s;tate, is altogether vanity.</P>
<P>NEVER was a &s;entence more &s;trong and forcible. Every word has an empha&s;is upon it. Man, not barely <HI>vain,</HI> but in the ab&s;tract, <HI>vanity.</HI> Not in a little but <HI>altogether vanity.</HI> Not in his wor&s;t condition; but in his <HI>be&s;t &s;tate.</HI> Not &s;ome few; but <HI>every man.</HI> And all this not a precarious a&s;&s;ertion, but a mo&s;t cer|tain truth. VERILY <HI>every man at his be&s;t e&s;tate is alto|gether vanity.</HI> This lies before us to illu&s;trate and improve.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="5" REF="008809_0004_102FF03A94000690">
1&s;t THEN; I am to illucidate and demon&s;trate the propo&s;ition, that every man at his be&s;t e&s;tate, is alto|gether vanity. And here I might premi&s;e, that man, at his fir&s;t creation, was not vanity, in that compleat &s;en&s;e, in which he is &s;ince. He was made a little lower than the angels and crowned with glory and honour. There was a real glory abiding on him: &s;omething &s;olid and &s;ub&s;tantial; till &s;in broke, and &s;often'd, and de&s;troyed his frame. By his fall from GOD he became <HI>vain in his imaginations:</HI> and hence he diffu&s;ed vanity and the cur&s;e through the lower cre|ation.&mdash; So was the <HI>creature made &s;ubject to vanity,</HI> by the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of <HI>Adam,</HI> the lord of this &s;ubjected earth. He became vain fir&s;t, in that bold attempt after godhead, when he eat the forbidden fruit. The vain man fancied that he had divinity within his reach: and the &s;erpent fed the illu&s;ion. Gen. iii. 5. <HI>For</HI> GOD <HI>doth know, that in the day you eat thereof, that your eyes &s;hall be opened; and ye &s;hall be as gods, knowing good and evil.</HI> Ravi&s;hed with the gaudy phantom, the fooli&s;h, pre&s;umptuous creature catch'd at it, tried to gra&s;p it to his bo&s;om, and hug and enjoy the bli&s;s: But how di&s;appointed was he! It glided from his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, it mocked his care&s;s, it appeared nothing but a gilded cloud, a fleeting &s;hadow; meer vanity. So that even then, at his be&s;t e&s;tate indeed; while he &s;tood fair as a cedar in the garden of GOD, he was deceived by va|nity;
<PB N="6" REF="008809_0005_102FF03D32584670">and confe&s;t him&s;elf vanity. <HI>Man being in honour abideth not.</HI> But &s;ince the fall, O what compleat va|nity is the race of <HI>Adam? Verily every man at his be&s;t e&s;tate is altogether vanity.</HI> Let us, if you plea&s;e, in|&s;tance a little, and &s;ee if the a&s;&s;ertion cannot be made out. Take the man in all the fine lights in which your fancy can place him, and let us try what we can make of it.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t IN his be&s;t e&s;tate of <HI>riches,</HI> he is no better than vanity. No worldly man ever did arrive at all the riches which his vain mind wi&s;h'd for. But form the idea better than the fact.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE a man po&s;&s;e&s;t of all the wealth of the earth.&mdash;Suppo&s;e him &s;eated in the mid&s;t of plenty, his tables cover'd with all kinds of luxuries, and all round &s;tand his unnumber'd &s;laves to execute his &s;overeign orders. His coffers are mines of gold and &s;ilver. They teem with coin, and blaze with jewels.&mdash;He is <HI>cloathed in purple and fine linen,</HI> he &s;ets upon an ivory throne, in the mid&s;t of a marble palace. Round about are his gardens, his orchards, his groves and his fields &s;preading in an endle&s;s pro&s;pect. I&s;&s;uing from the&s;e, he enters into magnificent cities, and walks through &s;treets of his own hou&s;es; every one, as he pa&s;&s;es,
<PB N="7" REF="008809_0006_102FF040E71DB3D0">bringing in tribute and revenues. In a word, the trea&s;ures of the world pour into his magazines, and he &s;hall be the proprietor of all regions where the &s;un vi&s;its.</P>
<P>WELL, here is an ideal rich man: &s;uch an one as never was really in the world: but we &s;et him in his be&s;t e&s;tate, that we may keep to the text, and attend to the conclu&s;ion. See the overgrown wretch then: and what do you behold! Why fir&s;t of all, a huge lump of vanity, a proud, haughty, di&s;dainful mortal, valuing him&s;elf upon the mo&s;t adventitious and exterior thing in the world. For all this his riches, he may be an ideot, a &s;ot, a villain without honour or con&s;cience. He may be &s;ick and in pain; he may be de&s;pi&s;ed and hated; no man may have a good thought of him; and at la&s;t he may die young, after he has lo&s;t all his wealth too, and not have a friend to clo&s;e his eyes.</P>
<P>WHAT think you now? Is this be&s;t e&s;tate vanity or not? See the &s;ucceeding ver&s;e of my context: <HI>Surely every man walketh in a vain &s;hew: &s;urely they are di&s;quieted in vain: he heapeth up riches and knoweth not who &s;hall gather them.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="008809_0007_102FF0434D69FD90">
THUS you &s;ee the &s;acred conclu&s;ion of the HOLY GHOST upon riches, that they al&s;o are vanity: That man at his be&s;t e&s;tate in the&s;e is no better him&s;elf than vanity. Never let us call them <HI>&s;ub&s;tance</HI> any more.</P>
<P N="2">2. CONSIDER the man at his be&s;t e&s;tate of <HI>honour,</HI> and lo! here he is al&s;o vanity. Suppo&s;e he is lifted to the pinnacle of earthly dignity, &s;eated upon the &s;u|pream throne, and gazed up at by a whole world of conquered nations. Suppo&s;e him rolling in his gilded chariot, thro' a <HI>range</HI> of triumphal arches, with a thou&s;and fettered monarchs marching in proce&s;&s;ion, before the ravi&s;h'd victor. Round about are torn &s;tandards and broken armour, the trophies of his &s;ucce&s;s, and the monuments of his glory. And now, applauded by millions he rides along, while the &s;ky echoes with his name and his honours. But what is this hero now, but another demon&s;tration of my doc|trine: Man at his be&s;t e&s;tate, and vanity? Amid&s;t all this vain pomp and glitter, may not his mind be unea&s;y, and his body in pain. May he not think, <Q>The&s;e people who acclaim me to day, may hi&s;s me to-morrow.</Q> Or may he not remember amid&s;t all, that in a few hours more death will &s;trip him of all, hurl him from all, and <HI>this poor &s;hirt be all the great conqueror carries away,</HI> and &s;ix foot of earth be all he
<PB N="9" REF="008809_0008_102FF0452BFD4E88">takes up. The dignity of this earth then is no &s;ecuri|ty again&s;t this aba&s;ing character in&s;cribed upon it, <HI>vanity.</HI> The mo&s;t honourable are no more &s;ecured than the vile&s;t and mo&s;t abject: But of both alike it is the &s;cripture a&s;&s;ertion, P&s;al. lxii. 9. <HI>Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: to be laid in the ballance they are altogether lighter than vanity.</HI> Near o'kin to this is the next head.</P>
<P N="3">3. AT his be&s;t e&s;tate of <HI>fame</HI> and <HI>reputation,</HI> man is altogether vanity. Suppo&s;e the man not only to be rai&s;ed above all in outward marks of re&s;pect and dig|nity: but every one &s;hall love him in their hearts; they &s;hall re&s;pect and admire him: They &s;hall talk every where of his excellencies, and every one believe what they &s;ay. They &s;hall &s;pread his fame far and wide, and he &s;hall be univer&s;ally known, and as uni|ver&s;ally valued, from the mo&s;t judicious critick to the lowe&s;t plebean.</P>
<P>WELL; and what can be a fairer picture of vanity in the whole world? What is more uncertain, than the e&s;teem of men; the breath of common fame? What more &s;welling and more empty? 'Tis vanity in the ab&s;tract: an idle bubble, blown up by the uncer|tain breath of others, that breaks in the attempt to catch it.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="008809_0009_102FF048C93CE610">
A MAN the mo&s;t applauded by others, may be the mo&s;t miferable creature in the world, in the &s;en&s;ations of his own mind. All the pompous titles of an oriental monarch, are but great &s;welling words of vanity. A &s;mall tran&s;ition will bring us to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="4">4. MAN at his be&s;t e&s;tate of <HI>power</HI> and <HI>authority,</HI> is altogether vanity. This carries in it a di&s;tinct idea from honour and fame: For a man may receive the highe&s;t marks of dignity, and titles of honour, and may be really e&s;teemed, and univer&s;ally applauded, and yet his authority and command may be very &s;mall. He may have great influence to attract, and but &s;mall power to oblige.</P>
<P>BUT &s;uppo&s;e a man advanced to the throne of &s;u|pream empire; a &s;overeign monarch, ab&s;olute and ar|bitrary in all his edicts.&mdash;On his breath hang the &s;ouls of millions. In his &s;ecret brea&s;t is depo&s;ited the march of armies, and the fate of nations. Peace, or battles, retreat, or blood&s;hed, or &s;afety, or de&s;truc|tion, wait the mandates of his de&s;potick voice.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE he has not a rebel in his va&s;t empire; or if he had thou&s;ands he has power to cru&s;h them in an in&s;tant, and only would appear the greater by
<PB N="11" REF="008809_0010_102FF04B39D7A5D0">the bold, &s;ucce&s;sle&s;s oppo&s;ition. And now what's the con&s;equence? why ju&s;t the &s;ame &s;till, advanc'd to the be&s;t e&s;tate, he &s;till remains vanity. Notwith&s;tand|ing all his authority, may he not be a &s;lave to his own lu&s;ts? May not ambition, revenge, luxury, pre|&s;umption and de&s;pair tyranize over him by turns, and claim a divided government in his &s;oul? And after all, may he not, <HI>mu&s;t he not</HI> re&s;ign it in death! At once the bla&s;t is given, and the bubble breaks.</P>
<P N="5">5. MAN at his be&s;t e&s;tate of <HI>plea&s;ure</HI> is altogether vanity.&mdash;Suppo&s;e him &s;urrounded with every object, fair to the eye, tuneful to the ear, delicate to the touch, fragrant to the &s;mell, and delightful to the ta&s;te. Suppo&s;e the generous wines flow round; and the &s;prightly concert &s;trikes up: wit and laughter &s;hall wake the genius and &s;hake the hall. The gay turn, the &s;ly remark, the &s;mart reply; ingenuity, mirth and good humour &s;hall be heard from all corners.</P>
<P>AND O what a &s;cene of abundant vanity have I here open'd! Here's a room full of dying creatures, upon the edges of eternity, ju&s;t &s;tepping into it, and O how &s;en&s;ele&s;s! abandon'd! frantick! Noi&s;e and clamour, thoughtle&s;s impertinence, and empty je&s;ting, &s;en&s;ual gratifications and idle game, make up that &s;trange mon|&s;ter
<PB N="12" REF="008809_0011_102FF04CC4309608">call'd <HI>earthly plea&s;ure.</HI> O how unfit for the choice of &s;uch creatures as we! how unequal to the capaci|ties of a rea&s;onable &s;oul! how &s;hort-liv'd, and uncer|tain, and tran&s;ient! The <HI>plea&s;ures of &s;in are but for a &s;ea&s;on:</HI> and even while they la&s;t, are vain and un&s;ub|&s;tantial too. Eccle. ii. 1, 2, 3. <HI>I &s;aid in my heart, go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy plea|plea&s;ure: and behold this al&s;o is vanity. I &s;aid of laughter, it is mad: and of mirth, what doth it? I &s;ought in mine heart to give my&s;elf unto wine, and to lay hold on folly.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. MAN at his be&s;t e&s;tate of <HI>body</HI> is altogether vanity. &mdash;In the former trials, I &s;uppos'd the man to have all exterior advantages: but now if you plea&s;e you &s;hall approach to add interior to them. Suppo&s;e then amid&s;t all this plenty, this dignity, fame, power, and mirth, the man enjoys a &s;trong and regular gu&s;t of appetite, to ta&s;te the various delights. Suppo&s;e him &s;trong, lively, active, of a firm con&s;titution and warm blood, glowing with the flu&s;h of youth, and hardy in the vigour of health: yet in this &s;en&s;e is the conclu|&s;ion &s;acred, Eccl. xi. 9. <HI>Childhood and youth are vanity.</HI> Suppo&s;e him in the bloom of years, beauty adorns his cheeks, and proportion &s;hapes his limbs, and every one gazes with eyes of approbation and love. Yet then is the conclu&s;ion al&s;o true. Prov. xxxi. 30. <HI>Favour is deceitful, beauty is vain.</HI> Poor vain creature, why are
<PB N="13" REF="008809_0012_102FF04F85628A40">the&s;e con&s;cious airs, and that fluttering attire? Mu&s;t not all this beauty fade? In a few moments more, will not tho&s;e fair colours vani&s;h from your face, and the eyes fix, and the lips turn pale? So a bubble &s;hines, and dances upon the &s;miling &s;urface of the flood, and in an in&s;tant di&s;appears, the beautiful round is lo&s;t, and its place is no more found.</P>
<P N="7">7. MAN, at his be&s;t e&s;tate of <HI>&s;oul</HI> is altogether vanity. The thought now ri&s;es, and the conclu&s;ion grows &s;trong. We may ea&s;ily conceive a plentiful e&s;tate, outward honours, &s;cenes of mirth, and a healthy body, and yet pronounce vanity upon all, while the <HI>mind</HI> was not adapted to ta&s;te the plea&s;ure: But &s;uppo&s;e it is, yet &s;ure now the point is made out, and the man is altogether vanity. Suppo&s;e the owner of ten thou&s;and volumes has rode po&s;t through his pages, yet may not the fine library line the walls of a narrow &s;oul? Has the man a &s;mattering of half a dozen languages; tho' he &s;peaks in the tongues of men and angels, and have not genius, he is but as <HI>&s;ounding bra&s;s, and a tinkling cymbal.</HI> Nothing &s;o empty and noi&s;y as a vain pedant.</P>
<P>BUT this reaches not the ca&s;e neither; &s;uppo&s;e then once more, a va&s;t <HI>genius,</HI> with all the ideas of learning and &s;peculation laid up in its faithful me|mory. Suppo&s;e a bright imagination, a quick inven|tion,
<PB N="14" REF="008809_0013_102FF051E8E1BA90">a penetrating &s;agacity, a correct judgment; a meer SOLOMON, excelling all mortals in wi&s;dom and knowledge&mdash;The fir&s;t thing we ob&s;erve upon this is, <HI>in his much wi&s;dom is much grief, and as he increa&s;eth knowledge he increa&s;eth &s;orrow.</HI> How vain mu&s;t the wi&s;e&s;t man be, if he is puft up with his own learning? After all his large acqui&s;itions, how much more re|mains unknown to him, than he already knows? There's hardly a fool upon earth, but would puzzle the conceited philo&s;opher, with que&s;tions upon the mo&s;t common &s;ubject. And after all, one little turn of brain; one &s;mall apartment di&s;turb'd, one minute cell overthrown, and down falls all this &s;tupendous fabrick of intellect, and the poor creature becomes &s;tupid, or wanton, or raving. 1 Cor. iii. 20. <HI>And again, the</HI> LORD <HI>knoweth the thoughts of the wi&s;e, that they are vain. Vain man would be wi&s;e!</HI> I &s;hall attempt but one labour more, and with this trial I &s;hall form the conclu&s;ion of the whole matter.</P>
<P N="8">8. Con&s;ider man in his be&s;t e&s;tate of virtue and <HI>morality,</HI> de&s;titute of the principle of renewed nature, and here too the point will be given, he <HI>is altogether vanity.</HI> You take notice, I here &s;ay, <HI>virtue</HI> and <HI>mora|lity</HI> as di&s;tingui&s;hed from <HI>holine&s;s</HI> and <HI>true piety.</HI> 'Tis the pagan ethicks and not the chri&s;tian &s;anctity that is
<PB N="15" REF="008809_0014_102FF055D561E468">the pre&s;ent &s;ubject. Well: but will not morality make us happy? Is not virtue a real good; the <HI>&s;um|mum bonum?</HI> The calm philo&s;opher; who could de|bate upon &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure, and deliberately pronounce vanity upon it all: Yet even he, dazzied by fal&s;e lights, and the appearance of truth in his argument, will ne|ver con&s;ent to have his beloved virtue pronounced vain too. Let us &s;ee a little then how far this conclu&s;ion will hold. Suppo&s;e a morali&s;t, who indulges no in|ordinate appetite or hurtful pa&s;&s;ion: Suppo&s;e he en|deavours after a generous love to mankind, and of all the &s;econd table of the law can &s;ay, all the&s;e have I kept from my youth. Yet mu&s;t it be &s;aid, there is &s;omething wanting, vanity within, &s;ome cha&s;m re|maining unfill'd. The voice of eternal truth him&s;elf pronounces, <HI>yet thou lacke&s;t one thing.</HI> Aye, but &s;uppo&s;e he is even &s;uper&s;titious in his regards to the fir&s;t table too, &s;o far as man in a &s;tate of fallen nature proceeds un&s;anctified by the SPIRIT OF GOD, the vanity &s;hall only be better fini&s;hed, and make a finer &s;how. Would you &s;ee the very picture of vanity; the very <HI>image and &s;uper&s;cription</HI> of it, I'll &s;how it you. Look into Luk. xviii. 11. <HI>The phari&s;ee &s;tood and prayed thus with him&s;elf;</HI> GOD, <HI>I thank thee that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unju&s;t, adulterers, or even as this publi|can. I fa&s;t twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I po&s;&s;e&s;s.</HI> If one was looking out for an emblem of va|nity,
<PB N="16" REF="008809_0015_102FF058B116C9A8">I know not how it were po&s;&s;ible to find a better.</P>
<P>VIRTUE then, and morality, if it go no further is but a vain appearance of good: this may puff a man up, but it can never be &s;atisfying, becau&s;e it can never be compleat. I know not how to help it, but till it is <HI>full</HI> it mu&s;t be <HI>hollow.</HI> Eccl. iv. 4. <HI>Again I con&s;idered every</HI> RIGHT WORK, <HI>this is al&s;o vanity and vexation of &s;pirit.</HI> The mo&s;t accompli&s;hed philo&s;opher among the heathen, and the exacte&s;t morali&s;ts they could boa&s;t, were for the mo&s;t part, the vaine&s;t things under heaven. They almo&s;t lived wholly to them&s;elves. Even their pompous talk upon the publick and the love of one's country, has &s;uch evident marks of vain glory upon it, that it is di&s;covered in almo&s;t every page by an attentive eye. Is even the dying &s;peech of a <HI>Socrates</HI> un&s;tained with it? The lu&s;t of fame &s;eems to be the grand &s;pring of their gaudy oratory, and hardy undertakings in what they call'd the cau&s;e of virtue. The mode&s;t <HI>Virgil</HI> him&s;elf is ea&s;ily detected. He &s;tumbles at the very thre&s;hold of his heroic lines, and the vain <HI>egoli&s;t</HI> appears full.&mdash;<HI>Ille ego qui quondam&mdash;</HI> unle&s;s the vain criticks can prove the lines to be none of his: as &s;ome of them have attempted.</P>
<P>AND among tho&s;e called chri&s;tians, can the ca&s;e be different? The bare moral man may be lovely in his
<PB N="17" REF="008809_0016_102FF05A37F19C08">accompli&s;hments, but morality alone will not &s;ave him. He may <HI>here</HI> lo&s;e it totally, and all his hopes from it <HI>hereafter</HI> will prove as <HI>the &s;pider's web.</HI></P>
<P>BUT I mu&s;t do the argument ju&s;tice. Man in his be&s;t e&s;tate of <HI>faith</HI> too, &s;hort of &s;aving, is &s;till only vanity. He <HI>only &s;eems</HI> to be religious, but <HI>that man's religion is vain. If he have all faith, &s;o as that he be able to remove mountains,</HI> and it <HI>work not by love,</HI> it is but a thin appearance and empty noi&s;e. <HI>Wilt thou know, O vain Man, that faith without works is dead!</HI> The &s;oul is wanting, and what you &s;ee is a vain phantom without &s;ub&s;tance. A dead thing you know is vain. Hence the &s;acred phra&s;e for the univer&s;al empire of death, is, <HI>the creature al&s;o is &s;ubject to vanity.</HI> I have now con&s;ider'd man in his be&s;t e&s;tate indeed, and lo, he is &s;till vanity.</P>
<P>THUS you have run through the &s;everal divi&s;ions of mankind, and what is the up&s;hot of the matter? What a mortifying conclu&s;ion is drawn from the con|fe&s;t premi&s;es? At his be&s;t e&s;tate of <HI>riches</HI> he is vanity, for he may be de&s;pi&s;ed: add <HI>honour</HI> to his riches, and he is vanity &s;till, for it may reach but a little way. Add extent of <HI>fame</HI> to the&s;e, and he is &s;till vanity for want of <HI>authority</HI> to &s;upport it. If he has all the&s;e, he may &s;till remain vanity, becau&s;e he is de&s;titute of &s;en|&s;ual
<PB N="18" REF="008809_0017_102FF05BC2C7EDE8">pleaures. Let him be &s;urrounded with joyous objects, yet they will be in vain if he wants <HI>vigour of appetite,</HI> and health of body. If he enjoys the&s;e, yet he mi&s;&s;es the nobler <HI>enjoyments of the mind,</HI> and there|fore is wretched vanity. Suppo&s;e he has the highe&s;t plea&s;ures of <HI>genius,</HI> yet he may be a &s;lave to vice: Or if he is a moral and a virtuous man, but not regenerated by the Spirit of GOD; yet in vain does he look for hap|pine&s;s, when <HI>death</HI> &s;hall proclaim him a <HI>&s;inner</HI> again&s;t GOD. Upon the whole, man at his be&s;t e&s;tate, is al|together vanity. So when our Father Adam had but two &s;ons in the world, the name of one of them, and the be&s;t of them too, was <HI>Abel,</HI> that is vanity. And <HI>being dead he yet &s;peaketh</HI> this great truth, that the be&s;t of the &s;ons of Adam are vanity, that man at his be&s;t e&s;tate is altogether vanity. Vanity! that is a bubble, a bladder of wind and water &s;luttering in the air, fair indeed, of mo&s;t correct and perfect &s;hape, exactly round, high and &s;hining: but hollow, frail, ea&s;ily and &s;uddenly broken, gone in a moment, and remembred no more. And <HI>what is your life</HI> but &s;uch a gilded va|pour, <HI>appearing for a little time and then vani&s;hing away.</HI></P>
<P>VANITY ! what's that? In the language of &s;crip|ture it is a &s;trange &s;ort of a <HI>thing:</HI> I would rather &s;ay, of a <HI>word.</HI> A non-entity, more thin than a chimera, more un&s;ub&s;tantial than a &s;hadow: <HI>le&s;s than nothing
<PB N="19" REF="008809_0018_102FF062427AD788">and vanity.</HI> And yet this is the condition of man; all nations of men! <HI>every man at his be&s;t e&s;tate!</HI> Are we now ready to improve the doctrine? And from what we have heard, we infer,</P>
<P N="1">1. IF in his <HI>be&s;t e&s;tate</HI> man is altogether vanity, no wonder he is &s;o in his <HI>common</HI> and his <HI>wor&s;t e&s;tate.</HI> In his &s;ickne&s;&s;es he may well <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;s months of vanity.</HI> Job vii. 3. In pain, ignominy, and reproach; in the vici&s;&s;itudes of providence, and the little portions of comfort, with the deep mixtures of afflictions, he may well be called vain, and &s;ee and acknowledge it him&s;elf.</P>
<P N="2">2. Is every man at his be&s;t e&s;tate vanity&mdash;O the mercy of GOD <HI>to regard man!</HI> What are we before him? Worms! that's too much, du&s;t and a&s;hes! that's too much; nothing! that's too much; <HI>le&s;s than nothing and vanity. What is man that thou art mindful of him, or the &s;on of man that thou vi&s;ite&s;t him?</HI> Even the angels are little before him, and he <HI>charges them with fooli&s;hne&s;s:</HI> But man is lower than they, nay altoge|ther vanity: And yet, O the amazing notice he takes of us! Herein is goodne&s;s and conde&s;cention my&s;teri|ous and inconceivable!</P>
<P N="3">3. Is man at his be&s;t e&s;tate vanity&mdash;O the grace of
<PB N="20" REF="008809_0019_102FF063C7991950">CHRIST to <HI>become man!</HI> What a wonder was it that he &s;hould take this nature into one per&s;on with the Son of GOD! He took the nature, under all its vain cir|cum&s;tances, excepting that one article, &s;in. He be|came the &s;ame frail, and brittle, and mortal man that we now are. Here now was man at his be&s;t e&s;tate, and yet hear what he &s;ays, P&s;al. xxii. 6. <HI>But I am a worm and no man.</HI> How &s;trange grace was this, that he who was all the fulne&s;s of the godhead bodily, &s;hould thus empty him&s;elf, and wear &s;uch an appear|ance of vanity, in the nature of man? And yet &s;o it was, and he cries out under it, P&s;al. cii. 2. <HI>My days are like a &s;hadow that declineth.</HI> Thus our LORD <HI>made him&s;elf of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a &s;ervant,</HI> and all this for our &s;alvation.</P>
<P N="4">4. From what we have heard, we infer, <HI>pride was not made for man.</HI> So empty, &s;o frail, &s;o deceitful a thing, to boa&s;t and glory, and admire it&s;elf: This is vanity with a witne&s;s! A creature dropping to du&s;t, and falling into a filthy grave, to &s;et up for &s;trength and beauty, honour and applau&s;e! Was ever any thing more ab&s;urd and ridiculous? So might an emmit crawl in &s;tate, and value it&s;elf upon its imaginary po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and conceited accompli&s;hments: So might a &s;hadow, lengthened by the &s;etting &s;un, admire to find
<PB N="21" REF="008809_0020_102FF0654E135CF0">it&s;elf grown &s;o tall, while in the &s;ame moment it was going to vani&s;h, blended in the gathering twilight, and lo&s;t in night and darkne&s;s. Far be from &s;uch thin appearances pride, ambition, or vain glory.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>WHAT a vain world is this,</HI> when man, the very head of it, is altogether vanity? So &s;ome read the text: <HI>Surely all is vanity, every man at his be&s;t e&s;tate.</HI></P>
<P>AND methinks it is no unfair conclu&s;ion, if man, the noble&s;t creature on the earth, is altogether vanity, the earth it&s;elf mu&s;t needs be a vain empty place. There's the appearance of good here: but 'tis not at all the le&s;s vain for that; but rather the more &s;o.&mdash;So Satan &s;hew'd our LORD <HI>all the kingdoms of the world, and all the glory of them, in a moment of time;</HI> and it was well he did &s;o; for had he not &s;een them in a moment, the &s;how would all have been over. For the <HI>fa&s;hion of this world pa&s;&s;eth away.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. AND to conclude: Let us <HI>not tru&s;t to any thing in this world. Tru&s;t not in man: for wherein is he to be accounted of. Cur&s;ed be the man that tru&s;teth in man, and maketh fle&s;h his arm.</HI> Not the wi&s;e&s;t, the greate&s;t, the be&s;t of men, are fit for our &s;teady confidence: <HI>Tru&s;t not in princes, who&s;e breath is in their no&s;trils. His
<PB N="22" REF="008809_0021_102FCB2D6E42D5A0">breath goeth forth, be returneth to his earth, and in that very day his thoughts peri&s;h.</HI> Tru&s;t not in uncertain riches, or in a frail life. Jam. iv. 13, 14. <HI>Go to now ye that &s;ay, to-day or to-morrow we will go into &s;uch a city, and continue there a year, and buy, and &s;ell, and get gain: Whereas ye know not what &s;hall be on the morrow: for what is your life? It is even a vapour that appeareth for a little time, and then vani&s;heth away.</HI> O awakened &s;oul, look back, and reflect inward, and &s;ay, I have now <HI>&s;een an end of all perfection.</HI> From this time will I &s;eek a <HI>better country, that is an heavenly.</HI> O ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, <HI>from thy &s;ulne&s;s let me receive, and grace upon grace.</HI> The&s;e things are <HI>but for a &s;ea&s;on:</HI> But <HI>JESUS CHRIST, the &s;ame ye&s;terday, to-day, and forever.</HI></P>
<P>THUS I have fini&s;hed what I intend on my &s;ubject in general: But what an illu&s;tration and example has the providence of heaven now given of it in the funeral of the Honourable Mr. DUMMER. In him we have, in many re&s;pects, &s;een <HI>man at his be&s;t e&s;tate:</HI> while the great GOD, has, by the dart of death, fixt on it the in&s;cription, VANITY. How nobly, for a &s;hining cour&s;e of years, did he fill the fir&s;t chair of govern|ment in the province, with &s;uperior wi&s;dom, and, I think, unrivalled acceptance and applau&s;e! How did he retire from it, followed with the gratitude and ble&s;&s;ings of a whole people! In the calm lei&s;ure of
<PB N="23" REF="008809_0022_102FF06CE77F34C0">his rece&s;s, in what amiable and venerable lights did he &s;hine in his dome&s;tic and amicable connections! His &s;teady family devotions, his &s;tated retirements to his clo&s;et, his applications to the entertaining and pi|ous pages of various kinds, his friendly entertain|ments, and his works of piety and charity, filled up his u&s;eful hours. This church can witne&s;s to the con&s;tancy and &s;olemnity of his exemplary attendance on the divine wor&s;hip: while his honors to CHRIST will be &s;till &s;een here, on the communion table, and in the co&s;tly volume from which the word of GOD is read every Lord's-day. His death was of a piece with his life, in the large donations to publick and pious u&s;es in his la&s;t will. So he &s;hone living and dy|ing: And what a &s;triking in&s;tance of <HI>man at his be&s;t e&s;tate!</HI>&mdash;But lift up the lid of the coffin, and &s;ee what is come of all that was mortal. Is this he whom we remember in the politene&s;s and dignity of former years! How broken with long di&s;|ea&s;e! with excruciating pains! with age! with death! Is this the unblemi&s;hed magi&s;trate, the PATRIOT GOVERNOR; loyal to his prince, and the father to his country! How changed from him in the bu&s;y &s;cenes and enterprize of active life! now <HI>lying &s;till and quiet, &s;leeping and at re&s;t; with kings and coun&s;ellors of the earth, which built de&s;olate places for them&s;elves.</HI> Deaf and uncon&s;cious is he to all the honours of his ap|plauding
<PB N="24" REF="008809_0023_102FF06EE18D33F0">country. The immortal mind indeed re|mains, and remains to pronounce <HI>vanity</HI> upon all that is not immortal. Duty and affection have obliged me thus much to the decea&s;ed: But the bu&s;ine&s;s of the pulpit is with the living.</P>
<P>SEE, <HI>you in the elevated &s;tations</HI> of life, the period of all your glory.

<HEAD><HI>EXTRACT from the</HI> BOSTON NEWS-PAPERS, October 26th, 1761.</HEAD>
<P>DEPARTED this life, the Honourable WILLIAM DUMMER, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> in the 84th year of his age; and on the 16th his funeral was attended with every mark of re&s;pect due to &s;o eminent a per&s;on.</P>
<P>SCARCE any one ever pa&s;s'd thro' life with a more un&s;potted character, or perform'd it's various duties with more univer&s;al e&s;teem. In the gaye&s;t &s;cenes of youth, he was pre&s;erv'd from the de&s;tructive paths of vice; and in maturer age, was a &s;hining example of the mo&s;t amiable virtues.</P>
<P>IN the beginning of the reign of GEORGE I. he was appointed our lieutenant governor. Upon the return of Colonel SHUTE to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> the chief command of the province devolv'd upon him. In this &s;tation he appear'd with di&s;tingui&s;hed lu&s;tre. The wi&s;e, incorrupt, and &s;ucce&s;sful admini&s;tration of Mr. DUMMER, will always be remembred with honor, and confider'd as a pattern worthy of the imitation of all future governors.&mdash;Uninfluenced by party prejudices,
<PB N="2" REF="008809_0025_102FF0733A5D9AC8">&s;uperior to all mercenary attachments, he di&s;covered no pa&s;&s;ion in his public character, but love to his country, and fidelity to his royal ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>HAVING fill'd the chair for &s;everal years, with dig|nity and u&s;efulne&s;s; when a &s;ucce&s;&s;or was appointed, he retir'd to enjoy the unenvied &s;atisfactions of a pri|vate life; with the approbation of a good con&s;cience, and the applau&s;e of his country.</P>
<P>IN his dome&s;tic character, he ever appear'd the af|fectionate hu&s;band,&mdash;the indulgent ma&s;ter,&mdash;the be|nevolent friend.</P>
<P>INSPIRED with a profound veneration of the &s;u|preme Being&mdash;firmly attach'd to the religion of JESUS: he received its doctrines with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, attended its in&s;titutions with reverence, and practiced its precepts with uniformity.</P>
<P>IN the mid&s;t of human grandeur, he di&s;cover'd the vanity of the world, in its brighte&s;t appearances; and made it the great bu&s;ine&s;s of life, to prepare for an holy and happy death.&mdash;He perceiv'd his body &s;ink|ing under the infirmities of age, without amazement; and waited with patience for the appointed time,
<PB N="3" REF="008809_0026_102FF07828F2AE68">when it &s;hould return to its original du&s;t.&mdash;He &s;aw eternity approaching, and redoubled his diligence, that he might be ready for the coming of his LORD.&mdash; In health and &s;ickne&s;s, he often declar'd his hope of the divine acceptance was built upon the merits and mediation of JESUS CHRIST, whom he ador'd as the true GOD, and only SAVIOUR of men.</P>
<P>WHILE he liv'd, his prayers, and his alms, conti|nually a&s;cended for a memorial before GOD: At his death, he left a great part of his e&s;tate to pious and charitable u&s;es. Having &s;erv'd his generation by the will of GOD, he fell a&s;leep, in a joyful expectation of a re&s;urrection to etternal life.</P>
