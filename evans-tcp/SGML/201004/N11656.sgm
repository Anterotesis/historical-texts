<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>AS, by the tyranny of GEORGE the Third, the compact of allegiance and protection between him and the good people of this Colony is totally di&s;&s;olved, and the whole power of government is by that means returned to the people at large; it is become ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to have this power collected and again repo&s;ed in &s;uch hands as may be judged mo&s;t likely to em|ploy it for the common good.</P>
<P>IN mo&s;t &s;tates, men have been too carele&s;s in the delegation of their governmental power; and not only di&s;po&s;ed of it in a very improper man|ner, but &s;uffered it to continue &s;o long in the &s;ame hands, that the <HI>deputies</HI> have, like the King and Lords of Great-Britain, at length become <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors in their own right;</HI> and in&s;tead of <HI>public &s;ervants,</HI> are in fact the <HI>ma&s;ters</HI> of the public. Our new Republics &s;hould u&s;e the utmo&s;t caution to avoid tho&s;e fatal errors; and be &s;upremely careful in placing that dangerous power of con|trolling the actions of individuals, in &s;uch a man|ner that it may not counteract the end for which it was e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>GOVERNMENT may be con&s;idered, a <HI>depo&s;ite</HI> of the power of &s;ociety in certain hands, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to <HI>re&s;train,</HI> and in &s;ome ca&s;es to take off &s;uch members of the community as di&s;turb the quiet and de&s;troy the &s;ecurity of the hone&s;t and peaceable &s;ubject. <HI>This government is founded in the nature of man, and is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> of civil &s;ociety;</HI> "yet &s;uch is the thi&s;t of power
<PB N="4" REF="014734_0003_0F94885440300CC8">in mo&s;t men, that they will &s;acrifice heaven and earth to wre&s;t it from its foundation; to e&s;tabli&s;h a power in them&s;elves to tyrannize over the per|&s;ons and properties of others." To prevent this, let every article of the con&s;titution or <HI>&s;ett of fun|damental rules</HI> by which even the &s;upreme power of the &s;tate &s;hall be governed, be formed by a convention of the delegates of the people, ap|pointed for that expre&s;s purpo&s;e: which con&s;titu|tion &s;hall neither be added to, dimini&s;hed from, nor altered in any re&s;pect by any power be&s;ides the power which fir&s;t framed it. By this means an effectual bar will be oppo&s;ed to tho&s;e enter|prizing &s;pirits, who have told us with much a&s;&s;urance, that after the people had made their annual or &s;eptennial <HI>offering,</HI> they had no more to do with government than their cattle.</P>
<P>A CONVENTION being &s;oon to &s;it in PHILADELPHIA; I have thought it my duty to collect &s;ome &s;entiments from a certain very &s;carce book, entitled an Hi&s;torical E&s;&s;ay on the Engli&s;h Con&s;titution, and publi&s;h them, with whatever improving ob&s;ervations our diffe|rent circum&s;tances may &s;ugge&s;t, for the peru&s;al of the gentlemen concerned in the arduous ta&s;k of framing a con&s;titution.</P>
<P>"THAT beautiful &s;y&s;tem, formed, (as Monte&s;|quieu &s;ays,) in the German woods, was intro|duced into England about the year four hundred and fifty." The peculiar excellence of this &s;y&s;tem con&s;i&s;ted in its incorporating &s;mall parcels of the people into little communities by them&s;elves. The&s;e petty &s;tates <HI>held parliaments often;</HI> for whatever concerned them in common, they met together and debated in com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">; and after
<PB N="5" REF="014734_0004_0F94885514D2FE60">due con&s;ideration of the matter, they called a vote, and decided the que&s;tion, by a majority of voices. In the&s;e councils every man had a voice, who had a re&s;idence of his own in the tithing, (or town&s;hip) and paid his tax and performed his &s;hare of the public duties. This &s;alutary in&s;ti|tution, our honorable Conference of Committees has again revived at their late &s;itting.</P>
<P>To avoid the tumult, which always mu&s;t at|tend the hearing and determining civil and cri|minal ca&s;es, by a popular tribunal, they had their executive courts in every town&s;hip; and &s;till kept the legi&s;lative and executive departments &s;eparate, in all ca&s;es what&s;oever.</P>
<P>AMONG the&s;e people we find the origin of the ine&s;timable trial by juries; and I am much mi&s;taken if our pre&s;ent Ju&s;tices of the Peace, may not al&s;o trace their derivation from the &s;ame &s;alubrious &s;ource.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The ancient <HI>Con&s;ervatores,</HI> were to all valuable purpo&s;es <HI>Ju&s;tices</HI> of the Peace.</NOTE> However that may be, one thing is certain, that "they founded their go|vernment on the common rights of mankind. They made the elective power of the people the fir&s;t principle of the con&s;titution, and delegated that power to &s;uch men as they could be&s;t confide in. But they were curiou&s;ly cautious in that re|&s;pect, knowing well the degenerating principles of mankind; that power makes a va&s;t difference in the temper and behaviour of men, and often converts a good man in private life to a tyrant in office. For this rea&s;on they never gave up their natural liberty or delegated their power for mak|ing laws, to any man for a longer time than one year."</P>
<P>"THE object upon which our elective power acts is remarkably different from that of the Ro|mans.
<PB N="6" REF="014734_0005_0F948855B7865B00">Theirs was directed to operate in the election of their chief officers, and particularly their con&s;uls; or tho&s;e who were ve&s;ted with the executive authority whom they changed annually. But the &s;enate where the principal power in their &s;tate was lodged, was a more fixed body of men; and not &s;ubject to the elective power of the people."</P>
<P>"OUR Saxon forefathers almo&s;t rever&s;ed this principle; for they made their wittenagemot or parliament, where the principal power was lodged, annually moveable and entirely &s;ubject to the elective power of the people; and gave a more fixed &s;tate to the executive authority. This la&s;t they confined within a certain &s;phere of action, pre&s;cribed by law; &s;o that it could not operate to the injury of any individual, either in his per&s;on or property; and was controllable in all acts of &s;tate, by the elective power which they ve&s;ted annually in their wittenagemot, or parliament."</P>
<P>"THE annual exerci&s;e of the elective power, was the quinte&s;&s;ence, the life and &s;oul of the con&s;titution; and the ba&s;is of the whole fabric of their government, from the internal police of the minute&s;t part of the country, to the admi|ni&s;tration of the government of the whole king|dom. This Saxon in&s;titution, formed a perfect model of government; where the natural rights of mankind were pre&s;erved, in their full exerci&s;e, pure and perfect, as far as the nature of &s;ociety will admit of."</P>
<P>"It would be &s;omething very &s;urprizing to find the people of England continually di&s;puting about the principles and powers, ve&s;ted in the con&s;ti|tuent parts of their government; did we not
<PB N="7" REF="014734_0006_0F948857DBCCED98">know that at this day it con&s;i&s;ts of a mixture of the old, or fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment, and that which took place at (and &s;ince) what is commonly cal|led the conque&s;t, by William the Fir&s;t. The&s;e two forms of government, the fir&s;t founded up|on the principles of liberty, and the latter upon the principles of &s;lavery, it is no wonder they are continually at war, one with the other. For the fir&s;t is grounded upon the natural rights of mankind, in the con&s;tant annual exerci&s;e of their elective power, and the latter upon the de&s;potic rule of one man. Hence our di&s;putants, drawing their arguments from two principles, widely different, mu&s;t of cour&s;e differ in their conclu|&s;ions."</P>
<P>"OUR Saxon forefathers e&s;tabli&s;hed their go|vernment in Britain, before the tran&s;actions of mankind were recorded in writing; at lea&s;t among the northern nations. They therefore handed down to po&s;terity, the principles of their government, by the actual exerci&s;e of their rights; which became the ancient u&s;age and cu&s;tom of the people, and the law of the land. And hence it came to pa&s;s, that when this ancient cu&s;tom and u&s;age cea&s;ed to act, the remembrance of the cu&s;tom cea&s;ed with it. We may add to this, that, &s;ince the conque&s;t, our arbitrary kings and men of arbitrary principles, have endeavored to de&s;troy the few remaining records, and hi&s;tori|cal facts that might keep in remembrance a form of government &s;o kind, friendly and ho&s;pitable to the human &s;pecies. It is for the&s;e rea&s;ons that we have &s;uch a &s;carcity of hi&s;torical evidence, concerning the principles and manner of con|ducting the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of our mode of government in this kingdom."</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="014734_0007_0F948857F7EF2720">
"HOWEVER, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e difficul|ties, there are many cu&s;toms, forms, principles and doctrines, that have been handed down to us by tradition; which will &s;erve as &s;o many landmarks, to guide our &s;teps to the foundation of this ancient &s;tructure, which, is only buried under the rubbi&s;h collected by time, and new e&s;tabli&s;hments. <HI>Whatever is of Saxon e&s;tabli&s;h|ment is truly con&s;titutional; but whatever is Nor|man, is beterogeneous to it, and partakes of a tyran|nical &s;pirit."</HI></P>
<P>"FROM the&s;e &s;ources it is, that I would en|deavor to draw the outlines of this ancient mo|del of government, e&s;tabli&s;hed in this kingdom by our Saxon forefathers; where it continued to grow and flouri&s;h, for &s;ix hundred years; 'till it was overwhelmed and de&s;troyed by William the Fir&s;t, commonly call'd the Conqueror, and lay buried under a load of tyranny for one hun|dred and forty &s;even years. When it aro&s;e again, like a phoenix from its own a&s;hes in the reign of Henry the Third, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of many concurrent cau&s;es; but principally by the bravery of the Engli&s;h people, under the conduct and intrepidity of our ancient and immortal barons, who re&s;tored it, in part, once more to this I&s;le. And tho' much impaired, maimed, and disfigured, it has &s;tood the admiration of many ages; and &s;till remains <HI>the mo&s;t noble and ancient monument of Gothic antiquity."</HI></P>
<P>IT was indeed re&s;tored in an impaired condi|tion; as a free con&s;titution mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be, when attempted to be introduced among a peo|ple, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the odious difference of con|dition of Lord and Va&s;&s;al.</P>

<HEAD>THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION.</HEAD>
<P><HI>The fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of our</HI> CONSTITUTION, <HI>by the</HI> SAXONS, <HI>to what is commonly called the</HI> NORMAN CONQUEST, <HI>under the</HI> HEPTARCHY.</P>
<P>"THE fir&s;t principle of a government that is founded on the natural rights of man|kind is the principle of annual election. Liberty and election are in this ca&s;e &s;ynonimous terms; <HI>for where there is no election there can be no liberty.</HI> And therefore the pre&s;ervation of this elective power, in its full extent, is the pre|&s;ervation of liberty in its full extent: and where that is re&s;trained in any degree, liberty is re&s;trained in ju&s;t the &s;ame proportion; and where that is de&s;troyed by any power in a &s;tate, whether mili|tary or civil, liberty is al&s;o de&s;troyed by that power, whether it be lodged in the hands of one man, one hundred or one thou&s;and."</P>
<P>"IT is reported by hi&s;torians that our Saxon forefathers had no kings in their own country, but lived in tribes or &s;mall communities, go|verned by laws of their own making, and magi|&s;trates of their own electing; and further, that a number of the&s;e communities were united toge|ther for their mutual defence and protection. But by what particular bond of union they were united, I know of no hi&s;torian, that hath given us any information. There were &s;even tribes of Saxons, that arrived in Britain about the &s;ame
<PB N="10" REF="014734_0009_0F948859D9A81998">time, under &s;o many different leaders; but as they had all the &s;ame intentions &s;o far as to e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;ame form of government, I &s;hall con&s;ider them in this re&s;pect indi&s;criminately."</P>
<P>"THEY fir&s;t divided the land into &s;mall parts, and that divided the inhabitants upon that land; and made them a di&s;tinct and &s;eparate people from any other. This divi&s;ion they called a tithing. Here they e&s;tabli&s;hed a government, which was, no doubt the &s;ame as that under which they lived in their Mother-Country. They had two &s;orts of tithings, one called a town tithing, and the other called a rural tithing. The&s;e were governed upon the &s;ame principles, only thus di&s;tingui&s;h|ed; as one is expre&s;&s;ive of a town having &s;uch a number of inhabitants as to make a tithing of it&s;elf; and the other of a tithing &s;ituated in the rural part of the kingdom. Thus they went on, as they conquered the country, to divide the land, till they had cut out the whole kingdom into tithings, and e&s;tabli&s;hed the &s;ame form of government in each."</P>
<P>"IN this manner they provided for the internal police of the whole country, which they ve&s;ted in the re&s;pective tithings, who annually elected the magi&s;trates that were to admini&s;ter ju&s;tice to them, agreeable to the laws and cu&s;toms they had brought with them from their Mother-Country. And this internal police was &s;o excel|lent in its nature, that it hath had the encomiums of mo&s;t authors of our hi&s;tory."</P>
<P>"THEY had a legi&s;lative authority in every tithing, which made laws and regulations for the good government of the tithing. Be&s;ides
<PB N="11" REF="014734_0010_0F94885A4A944850">the&s;e, they had a court of law, who&s;e juri&s;diction was confined to the &s;ame limits. All which were created by the elective power of the people, who were re&s;ident inhabitants of the tithing; and the right of election, was placed in every man who paid his &s;hot and bore his lot. From hence we may ea&s;ily perceive, that, under the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the&s;e tithings, by rea&s;on of their &s;mallne&s;s, the natural rights of mankind might very well be pre&s;erved in their fulle&s;t extent; as they could delegate their power by election without any confu&s;ion or inconvenience to the inhabitants."</P>
<P>"THE fir&s;t connexion the tithings had with one another, was to form an e&s;tabli&s;hment for the military defence of the country. For this end a number of the&s;e tithings were united to|gether, &s;o far as related to their military con|cerns. This union nece&s;&s;arily created a larger di|vi&s;ion of the land, equal to the number of tith|ings that were thus united; and this they called a wapentake or weapontake, and might take in as many tithings as would make a Brigade under a Brigadier General. Here likewi&s;e they e&s;tab|li&s;hed a court of council and a court of law, which la&s;t was called a wapentake court. In the court of council the chief magi&s;trates of every tithing a&s;&s;embled to elect officers of the militia to their re&s;pective command, and regulate all matters relating to the militia; in which, every individual tithing was concerned. The court of law was to enforce the&s;e regulations within the juri&s;diction." "Let us now con&s;ider the third and la&s;t divi&s;ion, which they made of the land. This was compo&s;ed of a certain number of wa|pentakes,
<PB N="12" REF="014734_0011_0F94885C808A1790">united together; which they called a &s;hire or one complete &s;hare or part into which they divided the land. This divi&s;ion completed their &s;y&s;tem of internal police; by uniting all the tithings within the &s;hire into one body, &s;ub|ject to &s;uch laws and regulations as &s;hould be made in their &s;hiregemots or &s;hire parliaments; for the benefit and good government of the &s;hire."</P>
<P>"As this divi&s;ion comprehended many tithings and many people, &s;o it had the greate&s;t court of council in England except the high court of parliament; and the chief officer was ve&s;ted with as high juri&s;diction in the &s;hire, as the king in the kingdom."</P>
<P>"THEY had likewi&s;e a court of law, called the &s;hire court; to which. I make no doubt every man might appeal who thought him&s;elf injured by the inferior courts in the &s;hire. The&s;e divi&s;ions in the land, are what I call the &s;keleton of the con&s;ti|tution which was animated and put in motion by all the&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments."</P>
<P>"WE may con&s;ider each &s;hire as a complete government; furni&s;hed with both a civil and a military power within its own juri&s;diction."</P>
<P>"LET us now &s;ee by what mode of union, the&s;e &s;hires became united together into a kingdom: and it will be found. I apprehend, that they pur&s;ued the &s;ame principles, which they had u&s;ed in every other e&s;tabli&s;hment. That is to &s;ay, wherever a combined intere&s;t was concerned and the people at large were affected by it, the immediate deputies of the people, met together to attend the re&s;pective intere&s;ts of their con&s;ti|tuents, and a majority of voices always bound the
<PB N="13" REF="014734_0012_0F94885D31F28F60">whole, and determined for any mea&s;ure, that was &s;uppo&s;ed to operate for the good of the whole combined body. This meeting of the deputies of the people, was called by the Saxons the wittenagemote, or a&s;&s;embly of the wi&s;e men of the nation; which compo&s;ed their national coun|cil and legi&s;lative authority."</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION, <HI>Under the</HI> MONARCHY.</HEAD>
<P>"I HAVE already remarked that a number of the Saxon tribes, while in their own country, were united together for their mutual pro|tection and defence. In like manner was our Heptarchy connected; and their mode of union became a part of the con&s;titution, when the &s;even kingdoms united together under one king. The matter was &s;imply this: one of the &s;even kings was always cho&s;en generali&s;&s;imo over the whole body; and they appointed him a &s;tanding coun|cil of a certain number of deputies, from each &s;tate, without who&s;e advice and concurrence, it is probable he could not act."</P>
<P>"HOWEVER I do not mean to make any ob&s;er|vation upon the powers ve&s;ted in this &s;tanding council; but only to point out that body of men as the origin of our hou&s;e of lords. Tho&s;e deputies who compo&s;ed this great &s;tanding coun|cil, were appointed to their tru&s;t by the joint
<PB N="14" REF="014734_0013_0F94885F43D5EF00">con&s;ent of the king and parliament of the little kingdom from whence they were &s;ent. And when Alfred the great, united the &s;even kingdoms into one, he undoubtedly, with the approbation of the people, incorporated this great council as a &s;epa|rate branch of the wittenagemote or parliament; &s;o that they &s;till continued to be the king's great council, and a branch of the legi&s;lative authority, which they are at this day. In confirmation of which, it is ob&s;ervable, that the con&s;ent of the parliament continued nece&s;&s;ary for creating a baron of the realm about as low down as Henry the Seventh; which is the only title by which any man can obtain his &s;eat in our Hou&s;e of Lords; and not as Duke, Marquis, Earl, Vi&s;|count, &amp;c."</P>
<P>"IT is needle&s;s to mention, that after the uni|on of the &s;even kingdoms under Alfred, a re|duction of the members to &s;erve in parliament became ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e it was then impracticable, by rea&s;on of their numbers, for the &s;ame members to attend, in one parliament, that u&s;ed to attend in &s;even, without &s;uch anar|chy and confu&s;ion as mu&s;t counteract the end of their meeting."</P>
<P>"NATURE her&s;elf has confined, or limited the number of men in all &s;ocieties, that meet together to inform and be informed, by argument and de|bate, within the natural powers of hearing and &s;peech. So that the que&s;tion in this ca&s;e mu&s;t have been how to reduce the repre&s;entatives of the people in parliament, to be a convenient number, to tran&s;act the bu&s;ine&s;s of the nation; and at the &s;ame time, to pre&s;erve the elective power of the people
<PB N="15" REF="014734_0014_0F948861510C1AF0">unhurt? a que&s;tion of no &s;mall difficulty to de|termine, con&s;idering the various intere&s;ts that were affected by it." <HI>And how was this effected?</HI></P>
<P>OUR hi&s;torian informs us; "they excluded from this parliament, all the repre&s;entatives of the rural tithings, as being a body of men the mo&s;t numerous of any, con&s;idered collectively, and yet elected by the fewe&s;t people in proportion, which, mu&s;t be very evident, &s;ince the rural part of the kingdom mu&s;t be more thinly inhabited than the towns. Be&s;ides the town tithings or boroughs, where a great number of inhabitants are collected together, upon a &s;mall compa&s;s of ground, were undoubtedly, the mo&s;t conveniently &s;ituated, for the commodious exerci&s;e of the elective power of the people. And the towns, being few in compari&s;on of the rural tithings, and at the &s;ame time di&s;per&s;ed over the whole country, were be&s;t adapted to receive the regula|tions they intended to make in their plan of forming the con&s;tituent parts of the new parlia|ment."</P>
<P>"THO' the barons of the realm being great free|holders, carried into parliament the greate&s;t con|cern for the intere&s;t of the rural part of the king|dom; yet not being elective, they were not &s;uch a body of men as the con&s;titution, and the &s;afety of the inhabitants of the rural tithings re|quired. And therefore, they con&s;tituted &s;hire elections, for two members, to repre&s;ent the &s;hire in parliament, and tho&s;e repre&s;entatives were the origin of our knights of the &s;hire."</P>
<P>"The barons of the realm, and the knights of the &s;hires, I con&s;ider as two bodies of men that
<PB N="16" REF="014734_0015_0F9488626ABD0A40">were &s;ub&s;tituted, at the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the mo|narchy, under Alfred the Great, in place of tho&s;e repre&s;entatives that u&s;ed to &s;erve under the Heptarchy for the rural tithings. The alteration that was made with re&s;pect to the towns and boroughs was &s;imply this: that all boroughs that u&s;ed to &s;end one member to the little parliament, to which they belonged, under the Heptarchy, &s;hould for the future &s;end two to the great parlia|ment of England."</P>
<P>FROM the above conci&s;e view of the Saxon affairs, it is plain, that in their own country, and for many years after they &s;ettled in England, they maintained that natural, wi&s;e and equal govern|ment, which has de&s;ervedly obtained the admi|ration of every civilized age and country.

And therefore, when the choice of an officer to pre&s;ide over them was their object of election, the concurrent &s;entiments of an uninflu|enced majority, of a multitude of people, would

<P>HAVING, in as brief and particular a manner as I was able, in the very &s;hort time allotted me, deduced the general outlines of a free government from the pure&s;t fountain yet known to man; it may not be unintere&s;ting to give a &s;hort extract of the hi&s;tory of</P>
<P><HI>The de&s;truction of the Saxon mode of government by a combination of the clergy with William the ba&s;tard, duke of Normandy.</HI></P>
<P>"BEFORE I proceed to ob&s;erve the de|&s;truction that was made in the con&s;titu|tion, or mode of government, by the fatal union of the church with William of Norman|dy, I mu&s;t not forget to take notice, that I have not given the clergy a place, in the Saxon par|liaments; becau&s;e they were foreign to the ori|ginal in&s;titution, and only grafted them&s;elves upon it, after it was e&s;tabli&s;hed in England. But as they afterwards obtained a con&s;iderable &s;hare, both in the legi&s;lative authority and the admini|&s;tration of government, it may not be ami&s;s to give &s;ome account how they came by it."</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="014734_0024_0F94886D14FDA070">
"THE Roman Pontiff had already extended his plan of church power to a great degree; and the nature of the government introduced into Europe, by the northern nations, greatly contri|buted to his &s;ucce&s;s. All hi&s;tory is full of the dreadful con&s;equences, that have attended the baleful influence, which every religious hierarchy hath always had upon the bulk of mankind. And a government founded upon the elective power of the people, where their favor was the high road to riches, power and grandeur, gave a fine opportunity to &s;uch an artful de&s;igning &s;et of men by their intrigues and influence, to pro|cure them&s;elves or their devotees to be elected into the chief magi&s;tracy of the country divi&s;ions. But this means they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves, in a great mea&s;ure of the legi&s;lative authority; and con&s;equently became, in proportion, the ma&s;ters of the &s;tate. For whoever is ma&s;ter of the legi&s;la|tive authority in any &s;tate, is undoubtedly ma&s;ter of that &s;tate."</P>
<P>"HAVING thus taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, as it were of the man&s;ion, they were not long before they began to plunder it. However they fir&s;t e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, and &s;ecured the power of the church, by a variety of laws, made in her favor; and de|fended them by every eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;hment, that papal cunning could invent. So that they were now prepared to receive, in the name of the church, all the riches, honors and power, which they could by any means obtain. And what is more, they knew too how to keep them when they had obtained them. For according to their maxim, whatever was given to the church, was given to God, and therefore was never
<PB N="26" REF="014734_0025_0F94886E28E6C3A0">afterwards &s;ubject to be taken away by any earthly power whatever."</P>
<P>"THUS they endeavored to provide again&s;t all revolutions in the &s;tate, that the property of the clergy might be &s;afe, under the name of the church. Upon this ground, the clergy have grafted them&s;elves upon every &s;tate in Europe. And as they are plants that will grow in any &s;oil, they have taken &s;uch deep root, that &s;carce any &s;tate, except Holland, has been &s;o unfriendly to their vegetation, as to exclude them from having &s;ome &s;hare in government; though they have no more bu&s;ine&s;s with ours, as a &s;eparate body of men, than the company of apothecaries or pari&s;h clerks."</P>
<P>"THE church continually acquiring riches and power, and never di&s;charging either, it mu&s;t fol|low that the clergy would, in a &s;hort time, be the riche&s;t and mo&s;t powerful body in any &s;tate where they were thus e&s;tabli&s;hed. Such was the &s;ituation of this kingdom, at the death of Edward the confe&s;&s;or; when England may be &s;aid to be governed by the power, and influence of the clergy. And we &s;hall &s;ee, pre&s;ently, how the&s;e &s;hepherds betrayed their flocks, and &s;urrendered them to the Norman tyranny."</P>
<P>"UNDER all tyranny, whether of kings, or prie&s;ts, or both, it is the people who are to be made the &s;acrifice; it is the people who are to be plundered of their property; it is the peo|ple who are to wear the yoke of &s;lavery; it is they who are to be made the hewers of wood and drawers of water. But &s;o long as the Engli&s;h government continued upon the original princi|ples,
<PB N="27" REF="014734_0026_0F94886E772D3E80">upon which it was founded; and the peo|ple annually exerci&s;ed their elective power; &s;o long it was out of the power, either of the king or the clergy to commit any acts of violence, with impunity."</P>
<P>"INDEED the clergy might recommend, and the people might con&s;ent to many things, that were wrong, and even ruinous in their con&s;e|quences; yet the latter had always in their own hands, a correcting remedy for all their errors. It was this correcting power in the people, that hung, like a mill&s;tone, over the pride, and riches of the clergy; and made them apprehen&s;ive that, at &s;ome time or other, it would cru&s;h them to pieces; and put an end to all their &s;chemes of authority riches and grandeur."</P>
<P>"THE parliament in the reign of Edward the confe&s;&s;or, had given &s;uch a &s;pecimen of their correcting power, as was enough to &s;hake the foundation of the papal chair; and that was by bani&s;hing Robert, Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, as an incendiary and fomentor of divi&s;ions, be|tween the king and his &s;ubjects, and appointing one Stigand, Archbi&s;hop in his room. By this they &s;aw there was only one way to avoid the danger, and pre&s;erve and extend their tyranny over the people; and that was to de&s;troy the elective power, and e&s;tabli&s;h an arbitrary govern|ment in the &s;tate. This, they were &s;o bold as to attempt, and &s;o happy as to &s;ee effected by William the Ba&s;tard duke of Normandy; who in the year one thou&s;and and &s;ixty &s;ix, put an end to the Saxon mode of government, which
<PB N="28" REF="014734_0027_0F94886F37563AB0">had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted &s;ix hundred years from its fir&s;t e&s;ta|bli&s;hment."</P>
<P><HI>What is commonly called the conque&s;t by William the fir&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>"WE are now come to that period of the Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, which contaminated the purity of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, or mode of govern|ment, with a de&s;potic &s;pirit, which time has not been able totally to eradicate."</P>
<P>"AFTER the death of Edward the confe&s;&s;or, there were two candidates for the crown of En|gland, which had always been elective, and con|tinued &s;o to this la&s;t Saxon king. The one was Harold, an Engli&s;hman of great natural abilities, much merit, and va&s;tly beloved by the people; who had been elected chief magi&s;trate of three &s;hires, Kent, Su&s;&s;ex and Surry, at the death of his father earl Goodwin, who before him had held the &s;ame offices."</P>
<P>"THE other was William the ba&s;tard duke of Normandy, who was a man of a warlike genius and a very powerful prince, who&s;e dominions be|ing &s;ituated oppo&s;ite to our coa&s;t, rendered it more convenient for him, than for any other prince, to tran&s;port an army into England, and con&s;e|quently to en&s;lave the nation. For which rea&s;on no one who was a friend to his country, would ever think of electing a man, who would be &s;o notoriou&s;ly dangerous to it's laws, liberty and con|&s;titution."</P>
<P>"INDEED the dangerous con&s;equence of his election was &s;o apparent, that, tho' the clergy had marked William for their man, yet they could not hinder the choice of Harold; and therefore
<PB N="29" REF="014734_0028_0F9488701877DEC8">he was elected king of England, by the wittena|gemot or parliament; and was accordingly crown|ed next day by the Archbi&s;hop of York."</P>
<P>"THE Pope, and William, finding them|&s;elves fru&s;trated in all their previous intrigues and &s;ecret cabals, in obtaining the crown of En|gland, for the latter, were re&s;olved to obtain it by open force: but the &s;tates of Normandy having re|fu&s;ed the duke an aid of money for the undertak|ing, he was obliged to have recour&s;e to &s;ome other means for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The pope, therefore, was now obliged to pull off the ma&s;k, and declare openly again&s;t England, and make a cru&s;ading bu&s;ine&s;s of it; which, was done with a view to encourage individuals to engage in the enterprize. And that all men might &s;ee that William was the champion of the church, he fir&s;t made the duke a pre&s;ent of a con&s;ecrated &s;tandard, with a golden <HI>agnus dei,</HI> and one of Saint Peter's hairs; and then &s;olemnly excommunicated every man that &s;hould oppo&s;e him."</P>
<P>"THE duke on his part offered the lands of England as a prize to be fought for, and to be divided among&s;t all tho&s;e that &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the conque&s;t; by which means he engaged not only great numbers of his own &s;ubjects, but many of his neighbours to a&s;&s;i&s;t him. Thus the duke of Normandy was enabled to fit out a fleet and an army, with which he invaded England; and, on the 14th of October 1066, was fought the ever memorable battle of Ha&s;tings, in which the Engli&s;h army was routed, and king Harold &s;lain; which flung the whole nation into confu|&s;ion,
<PB N="30" REF="014734_0029_0F9488729BA531B8">and &s;oon after procured the crown of En|gland to William."</P>
<P>"MORCAR and Edwin, two brave officers who di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves all that day in battle, retired in the night, with the broken remains of the army to London; in hopes to recover the people from their fright and con&s;ternation, and to apply &s;ome remedy to &s;o pre&s;&s;ing an evil. Hi&s;|torians ob&s;erve, that, in all probability, they would have &s;ucceeded, if the treacherous behavi|our of the clergy in London had not broken all their mea&s;ures, by &s;ecretly caballing among&s;t the people. The&s;e two officers, and &s;ome others who were zealous friends to the liberty of their country, a&s;&s;embled the people; and repre&s;ented to them, that the fir&s;t thing to be done was to come out of that &s;tate of anarchy and confu&s;ion they were in, and immediately elect &s;ome per|&s;on to the chief command. That Edgar Atheling was upon the &s;pot, and one of the family of their ancient kings; and that no man could have any ju&s;t objection again&s;t his advancement to the throne. That as &s;oon as he &s;hould be proclaimed king, he would &s;end orders to all parts of the kingdom to levy troops, and that the duke of Normandy &s;hould &s;oon find to his co&s;t, that the gaining a &s;ingle battle was not &s;ufficient to render him ma&s;ter of the kingdom. And to &s;pirit up the people the more to action, they put them in mind how they had defended their country, inch by inch again&s;t the Danes, for a great many years; and had at la&s;t drove them out of the kingdom; and that there was no doubt but they would do the &s;ame by this new invader."</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="014734_0030_0F94887682D21F48">
"THE clergy knew that this was the critical moment, and that if they could but keep things a little longer in confu&s;ion, their bu&s;ine&s;s was done, and therefore they openly oppo&s;ed every propo&s;al of re&s;i&s;tance.

<P>"THEY were no &s;ooner gone, than the arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury, the archbi&s;hop of York, the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, and the clergy about London, and &s;ome &s;ay prince Edgar him&s;elf (by their per&s;ua&s;ion) went to the duke at Berk|ham&s;tead and &s;wore fealty to him; as if he had been already their lawful &s;overeign. Hence we may ju&s;tly &s;ay, that the lives, liberty, and property of the people of England, were &s;urrendered into the hands of the Normans, by the baneful intere&s;t of the clergy. For the city of London, following the example of the clergy, &s;urrendered, afterwards the whole kingdom, without any further re&s;i&s;tance."</P>
<P>"THUS William the fir&s;t obtained the crown of England by the favor of the clergy, and not by the power of the &s;word, as, they would &s;eem to intimate, by his &s;urname the conqueror. A name inpo&s;ed upon him after his death, by the clergy, in order to &s;creen the infamy of their own actions from po&s;terity, that future genera|tions
<PB N="32" REF="014734_0031_0F9488778A6C84A0">might a&s;cribe, the mi&s;erable &s;tate of the people, to the conque&s;t of William, and not to the dark treachery of a body of men, who had, under the ma&s;k of religion, abu&s;ed every tru&s;t of of confidence repo&s;ed in them; and betrayed their flocks, bound hand and foot, like &s;heep to the &s;laughter."</P>
<P>"FROM this time, civil and religious tyranny, walked hand in hand, two mon&s;ters till then un|known in England; which are, equally, the common enemies to mankind, and have at all times, united again&s;t every principle of civil and religious liberty. This is the true origin of the alliance between church and &s;tate, &s;o much contended for by &s;ome of our eccle&s;ia&s;tics; who have renounced the penances of popery, but would fain retain both its pride and its power."</P>
<P>AND on the proceedings of Charles the fir&s;t's parliament, in the expul&s;ion of the bi&s;hops, the &s;ame author ob&s;erves,</P>
<P>"THAT it was their duty, as law makers, to remove from parliament, a body of men who had, con&s;titutionally, no right there; and who had invariably, directed their whole influence, again&s;t every principle of civil and religious liber|ty; and were now particularly dangerous to the &s;tate."</P>
<P>"IT is undoubtedly the mo&s;t ab&s;urd and per|nicious principle, that ever was received into any &s;ociety of men, to permit the clergy <HI>of any denomination,</HI> to have the lea&s;t di&s;tant &s;hare, or influence, upon the legi&s;lative authority of any nation. And had the motives of the hou&s;e of Commons, for excluding the bi&s;hops from the
<PB N="33" REF="014734_0032_0F948878383C1E40">hou&s;e of Lords been as good as their motion, they would have done this kingdom a mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential piece of &s;ervice; but their intent was only to pull down one nu&s;ance, in order to e&s;tabli&s;h another al|mo&s;t as bad. Their bu&s;ine&s;s, as law makers, was to protect every man in his right of private judgment, in point of religion; and not &s;uffer any &s;et of men to dictate to others in a matter that merely &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between God and a man's own &s;oul" &mdash;"Had they de&s;troyed all eccle&s;ia&s;tical power, they had de&s;troyed an evil in the &s;tate, and abun|dant matter of vexation. Had they protected all men alike, in their different modes of wor&s;hip|ing God, they would have taken away all ju&s;t occa&s;ion of offence and e&s;tabli&s;hed peace among&s;t men."</P>
<P>NOTHING can be more evident, than the mi&s;chief that has ever followed the requi&s;ition of a declaration of faith in doctrines acknowledged to be above human comprehen&s;ion, as a qualifi|cation for any civil tru&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>To believe that God is, and a rewarder according to our works;</HI> is the firm foundation of natural and revealed religion; and tho' he deigned to inform Mo&s;es, I AM, we find him plea&s;ed, at that time, to make no further di&s;covery of him|&s;elf. Neither are we hitherto convinced, that any, <HI>by &s;earching, have found him out to greater perfection.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT is here, faithfully quoted or mode&s;tly &s;ugge&s;ted, is intended to give no offence to any man, or body of men exi&s;ting. In matters wherein all are concerned, it is the duty of all to give notice of any thing they conceive
<PB N="34" REF="014734_0033_0F948878F4196ED0">might be hurtful to the public, if &s;uffered to pa&s;s without examination. It is a time when all the &s;agacity and diligence, all the temper and mode|ration of this va&s;t Continent, is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;epa|rate the <HI>precious</HI> from the <HI>vile.</HI></P>
<P>WE are happy that &s;uch plain and &s;alutary paths have been marked out before us. What|ever rubbi&s;h has been thrown into them, &s;hould be carefully removed, that, like <HI>wi&s;dom's ways,</HI> they may be <HI>plea&s;ant,</HI> and conduct us to a &s;ecure and virtuous PEACE.</P>
<P>MEN entru&s;ted with the formation of civil con&s;titutions, &s;hould remember they are <HI>paint|ing for eternity:</HI> that the &s;malle&s;t defect or re|dundancy in the &s;y&s;tem they frame may prove the de&s;truction of millions.</P>
<P>ABOVE all things, the greate&s;t care &s;hould be taken, that the per&s;ons who grant the public mo|ney, and &s;hould of cour&s;e have the power of en|quiring into its di&s;po&s;al, &s;hould have no hand in contracts; or any connection with per&s;ons thro' who&s;e hands the public trea&s;ure pa&s;&s;es. A hou&s;e of commons &s;hould indeed be the guardians of common right, and the intere&s;t of the public. Places, pen&s;ions and other emoluments, from the public trea&s;ury having, for near a century pa&s;t, been open to Briti&s;h commoners, their pow|er of bringing peculators to account, has been of no u&s;e to the oppre&s;&s;ed people. They have in|deed united with them, and formed &s;uch power|ful factions as have bid defiance to the whole na|tion. By this means, the legi&s;lative and execu|tive authority, which our wi&s;e and virtuous an|ce&s;tors, carefully kept a&s;under, are become con|founded
<PB N="35" REF="014734_0034_0F948879B3B6EFF8">together, in the hands of the &s;ame men. This has principally ari&s;en from another fatal in|attention of the people to the u&s;urpations of their deputies, when they took upon them to alter the fir&s;t principle of the con&s;titution by acts of parliament.</P>
<P>"UPON this foundation, they may mould it into what &s;hape they plea&s;e; and in the end make us &s;laves by law. The hou&s;e of commons are con&s;tituted, a body of men, merely pa&s;&s;ive, with regard to their creation, duration, and di&s;&s;o|lution; and therefore have no con&s;ent to give to their own duration, even for an hour."</P>
<P>"THERE cannot be a more dangerous doc|trine adopted in a &s;tate, than to admit that the legi&s;lative authority has a right to alter the con&s;ti|tution."</P>
<P>THIS &s;hrewd ob&s;ervation needs little to be &s;aid in proof of it. For as the con&s;titution limits the authority of the legi&s;lature; if the legi&s;lature can alter the con&s;titution, they can give them&s;elves what bounds they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>IT is therefore, I beg leave to repeat, that after the approaching Convention has met, and &s;ettled the grand outlines of a con&s;titution, let the le|gi&s;lature go on with the affairs of government, without &s;en&s;ible deviation from the obvious meaning of their dige&s;t; and whatever inconve|niences may be found unprovided for, may be candidly adverti&s;ed to the public, and amended by another Convention.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The powers of the &s;everal parts of the</HI> LEGISLATURE.</HEAD>
<P>THE re&s;pective powers of the &s;everal bran|ches of the Legi&s;lature come next into con&s;ideration. And it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that on this que&s;tion I find the greate&s;t difference of opinion among the really wi&s;e and learned, of any pertaining to our &s;y&s;tem. Some talk of having two councils, one legi&s;lative, and the other executive: &s;ome of a &s;mall executive coun|cil only; which &s;hould have nothing to do with framing the laws. Some would have the Go|vernor, an integral part of the legi&s;lature: others, only pre&s;ident of the council with a ca&s;ting vote.</P>
<P>The latter opinion appears to me mo&s;t con&s;o|nant to the intentions of wi&s;e framers of Govern|ments. The Governor &s;hould have a &s;eat in &s;ome part of the Legi&s;lature, that he might be fully acquainted with the nece&s;&s;ity and rea&s;ons for pa&s;&s;ing any bill into a law, and on the other hand, to prevent any one per&s;on from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing too much, or a dangerous power, he &s;hould have no more than a ca&s;ting vote when nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Some are &s;trenuous for only one legi&s;lative bo|dy namely, the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives: but a council will be found nece&s;&s;ary for the follow|ing rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>An Act, ever &s;o well intended, and in appear|ance ever &s;o well framed to promote the public good, will notwith&s;tanding, throw the &s;ociety into confu&s;ion, if it can be made appear that it is founded on principles which will not bear exa|mination.</P>
<P>The per&s;ons &s;elected to compo&s;e a council,
<PB N="37" REF="014734_0036_0F94887F9E5D50C0">are of cour&s;e always &s;uppo&s;ed to have a &s;uperior degree of acquaintance with the hi&s;tory, laws, and manners of mankind; and by that means they will be more likely to fore&s;ee the mi&s;chievous con&s;equences, that might follow a proceeding, which at fir&s;t view did not appear to have any thing dangerous in it, to many hone&s;t men, who may however, be very worthy of a &s;eat in the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>For on no circum&s;tance does the public peace and pro&s;perity more immediately depend, than on the clearne&s;s, fullne&s;s and con&s;i&s;tency of the laws.</P>
<P>The Governor &s;hould be furni&s;hed with a &s;mall privy council, to afford him their advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the executive department; but they &s;hould have no &s;hare whatever in the Legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>In this capacity they &s;hould take cognizance of high crimes; &s;uch as mal-admini&s;tration of Judges in their offices; being the proper inque&s;t for this purpo&s;e&mdash;The A&s;&s;embly and Legi&s;lative Council, in like manner to enquire into the con|duct of the Governor and privy council, and the cau&s;e of complaint being found, a regular trial by the country &s;hould determine all cau&s;es whatever.</P>
<P>A COUNCIL, annually eligible, will endeavor to maintain their feats by the rectitude of their conduct.</P>
<P>To &s;uppo&s;e they can <HI>inveterate</HI> them&s;elves, is to &s;uppo&s;e that mankind will forget the mi&s;chiefs which have over&s;pread the world from the days of Sylla to the pre&s;ent bloody period, from the &s;ame tyrannic &s;ource.</P>
<P>WE &s;hould make all prudent provi&s;ion for po|&s;terity, and indeed the mo&s;t &s;alutary provi&s;ion we can po&s;&s;ibly make for them, is to enable
<PB N="38" REF="014734_0037_0F94887FC86C8A38">them to provide for them&s;elves; but we ought never to run into one extreme to avoid another.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t important mea&s;ure I would propo&s;e, is, that, whereas the heat of war in our very neighbourhood, may well be &s;uppo&s;ed to agitate the minds of the delegates in convention, and render it impo&s;&s;ible to have every provi&s;ion made for the &s;ecurity of our liberties, that cool and continued reflexion would &s;ugge&s;t, after the principal parts of the con&s;titution are e&s;tabli&s;hed, an adjounment might be made to a convenient day; and mean while every man might be in|vited to give his &s;entiments freely and di&s;creetly upon any part of the &s;y&s;tem he might conceive could be altered for the better.</P>
<P>PROBABLY a decennial meeting of delegates, to examine the &s;tate of the con&s;titution, and con|duct of the government, would not be an impru|dent provi&s;ion for keeping the con&s;titution in health and vigor, by having an opportunity to &s;ee that it did not depart from its fir&s;t principles. This would be effectually holding the &s;upreme power in its <HI>only</HI> &s;afe repo&s;itory <HI>the hands of</HI> THE PEOPLE.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>THE la&s;t and greate&s;t &s;ecurity that men can have for a permanent enjoyment of their rights, is to learn, what they are from their very elements, as they are well ex|plained by Burlamaqui and others; and be&s;ides, to learn the art of defending them with their arms.</P>
<P>I, ALIKE di&s;commend a heedle&s;s inattention to the concerns of our country and po&s;terity; and a de&s;pairing anxiety, grounded on a &s;uppo&s;ition, that if &s;ome particular matters are not &s;ettled in ju&s;t &s;uch particular manners, that all will be lo&s;t irrecoverably.</P>
<P>THIS is a day of cool and impartial enquiry. Adver&s;ity &s;obers our &s;pirits and cau&s;es us to give each other a patient hearing. We learn from our troubles that each man needs the advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his neighbour: and perhaps this is not the mo&s;t trivial le&s;&s;on.</P>
<P>THE varying circum&s;tances of our &s;ituation, have gradually pointed out arrangements already which no man could have fore&s;een &s;ome months ago: tho&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ive improvements which will thence ari&s;e, and the advantage of &s;uch a communication of &s;entiments as will accrue from the e&s;tabli&s;hment of frequent town meetings among the people, will give &s;uch a new face to the affairs of this colony, and rai&s;e up &s;o many able men to improve its internal police; that as arts and manufactures have already made it their peculiar, or at lea&s;t principal re&s;idence, &s;o we

<HEAD>IN CONGRESS, JULY 4, 1776.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A DECLARATION by the REPRESENTATIVES of the UNITED STATES of AMERICA, in General CONGRESS a&s;&s;embled.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN in the cour&s;e of human Events, it becomes nece&s;&s;ary for one people to di&s;|&s;olve the Political Bands which have con|nected them with another, and to a&s;&s;ume among the Powers of the Earth, the &s;eparate and equal Station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent Re&s;pect to the Opinions of Mankind requires, that they &s;hould declare the cau&s;es; which impel them to the Separation.</P>
<P>WE hold the&s;e Truths to be &s;elf-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are en|dowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among the&s;e are Life, Liberty, and the Pur&s;uit of Happine&s;s&mdash;That to &s;ecure the&s;e Rights, Governments are in&s;tituted among Men; deriving their ju&s;t Powers from the Con&s;ent of the Governed, that whenever any Form of Go|vernment becomes de&s;tructive of the&s;e Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to aboli&s;h it, and to in&s;titute new Government, laying its &s;oun|dation on &s;uch principles, and organizing its pow|ers in &s;uch form, as to them &s;hall &s;eem mo&s;t likely to effect their &s;afety and happine&s;s. Prudence, in|deed, will dictate that governments long e&s;ta|bli&s;hed &s;hould not be changed for light and tran|&s;ient cau&s;es; and accordingly all experience hath
<PB N="42" REF="014734_0041_0F948882B31AC768">&s;hewn, that mankind are more di&s;po&s;ed to &s;uffer, while evils are &s;ufferable, than to right them|&s;elves by aboli&s;hing the forms to which they are accu&s;tomed. But when a long train of abures and u&s;urpations, pur&s;uing invariably the &s;ame object, evinces a de&s;ign to reduce them under ab&s;olute de&s;poti&s;m, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off &s;uch government, and to provide new guards for their future &s;ecurity. Such has been the patient &s;ufferance of the&s;e colonies, and &s;uch is now the nece&s;&s;ity which con&s;trains them to al|ter their former &s;y&s;tems of government. The hi&s;tory of the pre&s;ent King of Great Britain is a hi&s;tory of repeated injuries and u&s;urpations, all having in direct object the e&s;tabli&s;hment of an ab&s;olute tyranny over the&s;e &s;tates. To prove this, let facts be &s;ubmitted to a candid world.</P>
<P>HE has refu&s;ed his a&s;&s;ent to laws, the mo&s;t whole&s;ome and nece&s;&s;ary for the public good.</P>
<P>HE has forbidden his Governors to pa&s;s laws of immediate and pre&s;&s;ing importance, unle&s;s &s;u&s;pended in their operation till his a&s;&s;ent &s;hould be obtained; and, when &s;o &s;u&s;pended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.</P>
<P>HE has refu&s;ed to pa&s;s other laws for the ac|comodation of large di&s;tricts of people, unle&s;s tho&s;e people would relinqui&s;h the right of repre|&s;entation in the legi&s;lature, a right ine&s;timable to them, and formidable to tyrants only.</P>
<P>He has called together legi&s;lative bodies at places unu&s;ual, uncomfortable, and di&s;tant from the depo&s;itory of their public records, for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of fatiguing them into compliance with his mea&s;ures.</P>

HE has di&s;&s;olved Repre&s;entative Hou&s;es re|peatedly, for oppo&s;ing with manly firmne&s;s his inva&s;ions on the Rights of the people.</P>
<P>HE has refu&s;ed for a long time, after &s;uch di&s;&s;olutions, to cau&s;e others to be elected; where|by the legi&s;lative powers, incapable of annihila|tion, have returned to the people at large for their exerci&s;e; the &s;tate remaining in the mean time expo&s;ed to all the dangers of inva&s;ion from without, and convul&s;ions within.</P>
<P>He has endeavoured to prevent the population of the&s;e &s;tates; for that purpo&s;e ob&s;tructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners; refu&s;ing to pa&s;s others to encourage their migrations hither, and rai&s;ing the conditions of new appropriations of lands.</P>
<P>He has ob&s;tructed the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, by refu&s;ing his a&s;&s;ent to laws for e&s;tabli&s;hing ju|diciary powers.</P>
<P>He has made Judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their &s;alaries.</P>
<P>He has erected a multitude of new offices, and &s;ent hither &s;warms of officers to harra&s;s our peo|ple, and eat out their &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>He has kept among us, in times of peace, &s;tanding armies, without the con&s;ent of our legi&s;latures.</P>
<P>He has affected to render the military inde|pendent of, and &s;uperior to the civil power.</P>
<P>He has combined with others to &s;ubject us to a juri&s;diction foreign to our con&s;titution, and un|acknowledged by our laws; giving his a&s;&s;ent to their acts of pretended legi&s;lation:</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="014734_0043_0F948885E2EE8528">
For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:</P>
<P>For protecting them, by a mock trial, from puni&s;hment for any murders which they &s;hould commit on the inhabitants of the&s;e &s;tates:</P>
<P>For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world:</P>
<P>For impo&s;ing taxes on us without our con&s;ent:</P>
<P>For depriving us, in many ca&s;es, of the bene|fits of trial by jury:</P>

<P>For taking away our charters, aboli&s;hing our mo&s;t valuable laws, and altering fundamentally the forms of our governments:</P>
<P>For &s;u&s;pending our own legi&s;latures, and de|claring them&s;elves inve&s;ted with power to legi&s;late for us in all ca&s;es what&s;oever.</P>
<P>He has abdicated government here, by de|claring us out of his protection and waging war again&s;t us.</P>
<P>He has plundered our &s;eas, ravaged our coa&s;ts, burnt our towns, and de&s;troyed the lives of our people.</P>
<P>He is, at this time, tran&s;porting large armies of foreign mercenaries to compleat the works of death, de&s;olation, and tyranny, already begun with circum&s;tances of cruelty and perfidy &s;carcely
<PB N="45" REF="014734_0044_0F948889E0F7B280">paralleled in the mo&s;t barbarous ages, and to|tally unworthy the head of a civilized nation.</P>
<P>He has con&s;trained our fellow Citizens taken captive on the high &s;eas to bear arms again&s;t their country, to become the executioners of their friends and brethren, or to fall them&s;elves by their hands.</P>
<P>He has excited dome&s;tic in&s;urrections among&s;t us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabi|tants of our frontiers, the mercile&s;s Indian &s;avages, who&s;e known rule of warfare, is an un|di&s;tingui&s;hed de&s;truction, of all ages, &s;exes and conditions.</P>
<P>In every &s;tage of the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ions we have pe|titioned for redre&s;s in the mo&s;t humble terms: Our repeated petitions have been an&s;wered only by repeated injury. A prince, who&s;e character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.</P>
<P>Nor have we been wanting in attentions to our Briti&s;h brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legi&s;lature to extend an unwarrantable juri&s;diction over us. We have reminded them of the circum&s;tances of our emigration and &s;ettlement here. We have appealed to their native ju&s;tice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to di&s;avow the&s;e u&s;urpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connexions and corre&s;pondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of ju&s;tice and of con&s;anguinity. We mu&s;t, therefore, acquie&s;ce in the nece&s;&s;ity, which denounces our &s;eparation, and hold them, as we hold the re&s;t of mankind, enemies in war, in peace, friends.</P>

<P>AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE THE INTEREST AND GLORY OF GREAT BRITAIN; OR, ARGUMENTS to prove, that not only in TAXATION, but in TRADE, MANUFACTURES, and GOVERNMENT, the Colonies are entitled to an entire Independency on the BRITISH LEGISLATURE; and that it can only be by a formal DECLARATION of the&s;e Rights, and forming there|upon a friendly LEAGUE with them, that the true and la&s;t|ing Welfare of both Countries can be promoted. In a SERIES of LETTERS to the LEGISLATURE.</P>
<Q><P>It is not to be hoped, in the corrupt State of Human Nature, that any Nation will be &s;ubject to another, any longer than it finds its own Account in it, and cannot help it&s;elf.</P>
<P>No Creatures &s;uck the Teats of their Dams longer than they can draw Milk from thence, or can provide them&s;elves with better Food; nor will any Country continue their &s;ubjection to ano|ther, only becau&s;e their great Grand-Mothers were acquainted. This is the cour&s;e of human affairs, and all wi&s;e States will always have it before their eyes.</P>
