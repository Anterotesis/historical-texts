<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE politics of regenerated France having candour, frankne&s;s, and publicity for their only ba&s;is, the my&s;terious &s;ecrecy of courts being entirely rejected from her councils, and the only art of her public agents being that of u&s;ing none, I have informed you, that I would publi&s;h my Corre&s;pondence with the Federal Government, and likewi&s;e the in&s;tructions that have been given to me by the Executive Council of the French Republic. The &s;heets which contain my corre&s;pondence are not yet printed off, but tho&s;e which contain the tran&s;lation of my in&s;tructions being fini&s;hed, I ha&s;ten to inclo&s;e to you copies of them. I beg that they may be di&s;tributed among the members of Congre&s;s, and that you will reque&s;t the Pre&s;ident of the United States to lay them officia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly before the hou&s;es of that legi&s;lative body. This fir&s;t part of the collection, which I announce to you, and which I &s;hall tran&s;|mit to you in due &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, will enable the repre&s;entatives of the American people to determine, whether my political conduct, &s;ince have re&s;ided in the United States, has been conformable to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|tions of the French people.

<HEAD>In&s;tructions to <HI>CITIZEN GENET,</HI> Mini&s;ter Plenipotentiary from the French Republic to the United States&mdash;from the Executive Council and Mini&s;ter of Marine.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Memorial to &s;erve as In&s;tructions to <HI>CITIZEN GENET,</HI> Adjutant-general and Colonel, going to America in quality of Mini&s;ter Plenipotentiary of the French Republic to the Congre&s;s of the United States.</HEAD>
<P>THE patrioti&s;m which Citizen Genet has &s;hewn in the different employments entru&s;ted to him, and his known attachment for the cau&s;e of liberty and equality, have determined the Executive Council to no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">inate him Mini&s;ter Plenipotentiary of the French Republic to the Congre&s;s of the United States of America. This proof of confidence is the more flat|tering for Citizen Genet, as the French nation &s;et a high value upon the ties which unite them to the American people, ties which the National A&s;&s;embly has, on the ad June, 1791, &s;hewn the de&s;ire to draw &s;till clo&s;er; and the legi&s;lature has, moreover, expre&s;sly ordered the Executive Power to negociate with the United States a new treaty of commerce, which may increa&s;e, between the two nations, tho&s;e con|nections mutually advantageous both to the one and to the other of them. Struck with the grandeur and importance of this negociation, the Executive Council pre&s;cribes to Citizen Genet to exert him&s;elf to &s;trengthen the Americans in the principles which led them to unite them&s;elves to France; to make them perceive, that they have no ally
<PB N="3" REF="047056_0003_1022980D85D06740" MS="y">more natural or more di&s;po&s;ed to treat them as brethren; that the&s;e &s;entiments are engraven on the hearts of all Frenchmen enlightened upon the true intere&s;ts of their own country; and, if the two nations have not yet reaped the advantage, it has been the fault of the govern|ment we have ju&s;t overthrown; it is through the rea&s;on of the cabinet of Ver&s;ailles. This truth is this day revealed. The Executive Coun|cil has called for the in&s;tructions given to Citizen Genet's predece&s;&s;ors in America, and has &s;een in them, with indignation, that at the very time the good people of America expre&s;&s;ed their gratitude to us in the mo&s;t feeling manner, and gave us every proof of their friend&s;hip, Vergeenns and Montmorin thought, that it was right for France to hinder the United States from taking that political &s;tability of which they were capable, becau&s;e they would &s;oon acquire a &s;trength, which, it was probable, they would be eager to abu&s;e. They, in con&s;equence, directed both the one and the other of the&s;e Mini&s;ters of Louis XVI. to the Congre&s;s, to pre&s;erve the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ive conduct, and to &s;peak only of the Prince's per&s;onal wi&s;hes for the pro&s;perity of the United States. The &s;ame Machiavelian principle influenced the operations of the war for independence; the &s;ame duplicity reigned over the negociations for peace. The deputies from Congre&s;s expre&s;&s;ed the de&s;ire, that the cabinet of Ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ailles would a&s;&s;i&s;t in the conque&s;t of the two Floridas, of Canada, and of Nova Scotia; but Louis and his mini&s;ters con&s;tantly refu&s;ed, looking upon the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e countries by Spain and England, as a u&s;eful principle of unea&s;ine&s;s and vigilance for the Ame|ricans after the peace. This u&s;ele&s;s jealou&s;y turned into contempt; the people for whom they pretended to have taken up arms, became an object of di&s;dain; for the court neglected to corre&s;pond with them, and by that criminal conduct they gave the power, who&s;e influence in America we ought to have extingni&s;hed, arms to combat and de&s;troy our own.</P>
<P>It is thus the mini&s;ters, under the old &s;y&s;tem, blindly laboured with all their exertions to &s;tifle liberty, after having been compelled by the general voice of the nation to a&s;&s;i&s;t its birth in the new world; 'tis thus they cooled the zeal; 'tis thus they loo&s;ened the bands of the two people; 'tis thus that by their infamous policy they di&s;gu&s;ted the Americans with the French alliance, and &s;trengthened, them&s;elves, that of the Engli&s;h. The republicans who have di&s;placed the&s;e vile &s;up|porters of de&s;poti&s;m, are eager to mark out for Citizen Genet, a path diametrically oppo&s;ite to the crooked windings by which his predece&s;&s;ors were entangled. The Executive Council, faithful to its duties, and obedient to the will of the French people, authorized Citizen Genet to declare with freedom and &s;incerity, to the mini&s;ters of Congre&s;s, that
<PB N="4" REF="047056_0004_1022980F14F44DB8">tho&s;e of the French republic, throwing far from them every thing appertaining to the old emba&s;&s;y, the revenue &s;y&s;tem, the cautious po|licy, and all tho&s;e impediments to the riches and pro&s;perity of the nations, have highly approved the overtures made to Citizen Ternant, as well by General Wa&s;hington as by Mr. Jeffer&s;on, upon the means of renewing and con&s;olidating our commercial ties, in placing them on the principles of truth it&s;elf; that the Executive Council are di&s;po&s;ed to &s;et on foot a negociation upon tho&s;e foundations, and that they do not know but that &s;uch a treaty admits a latitude &s;till more exten&s;ive in becoming a national agreement, in which two great people &s;hall &s;u&s;pend their commercial and political intere&s;ts, and e&s;tabli&s;h a mutual under|&s;tanding, to befriend the empire of liberty, wherever it can be em|braced, to guarantee the &s;overeignty of the people, and puni&s;h tho&s;e powers who &s;till keep up an exclu&s;ive colonial and commercial &s;y&s;tem, by declaring that their ve&s;&s;els &s;hall not be received in the ports of the contracting parties. Such a pact which the people of France will &s;up|port with all the energy which di&s;tingui&s;hes them, and of which they have already given &s;o many proofs, will quickly contribute to the ge|neral emancipation of the new world. However va&s;t this project may be, it will not be difficult to execute, if the Americans determine on it, and it is to convince them of its practicability that Citizen Genet mu&s;t direct all his attention: for, be&s;ides the advantages which humanity in general will draw from the &s;ucce&s;s of &s;uch a negociation, we have at this moment a particular intere&s;t in taking &s;teps to act efficaciou&s;ly again&s;t England and Spain, if, as every thing announces, the&s;e powers attack us from hatred to our principles; if the Engli&s;h mini&s;ters, in&s;tead of &s;haring in the glory of France, in&s;tead of con&s;idering that our liberty, as well as that of tho&s;e people who&s;e chains we have broken, for ever e&s;tabli&s;hes that of their own country, &s;uffer them&s;elves to be influenced by our enemies, and by tho&s;e to the liberty of mankind, and embark with every tyrant again&s;t that cau&s;e which we are defending. The military preparations making in Great Britain become every day more and more &s;erious, and have an intimate connection with tho&s;e of Spain. The friend&s;hip which reigns between the mini&s;ters of the la&s;t power and tho&s;e of St. James's proves it; and in this &s;ituation of affairs we ought to ex|cite, by all po&s;&s;ible means, the zeal of the Americans, who are as much intere&s;ted as our&s;elves, in di&s;cerning the de&s;tructive projects of George the Third, in which they are probably an object. Their own &s;afety f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll depends on ours, and if we fail, they will &s;ooner or later fall under the iron rod of Great Britain.&mdash;The executive Council has room to be|lieve that the&s;e rea&s;ons, in addition to the great commercial advantages which we are di&s;po&s;ed to concede to the United States, will determine
<PB N="5" REF="047056_0005_10229811057585A0">their government to adhere to all that Citizen Genet &s;hall propo&s;e to them on our part. And it is po&s;&s;ible, however, that the fal&s;e repre|&s;entations which have been made to Congre&s;s, of the &s;ituation of our internal affairs, of the &s;tate of our maritime force, of our finances, and e&s;pecially of the &s;torms with which we are threatened, may make her mini&s;ters, in the negociations which Citizen Genet is intru&s;ted to open, adopt a timid and wavering conduct, the Executive Council charges him, in expectation that the American government will finally deter|mine to make a common cau&s;e with us, to take &s;uch &s;teps as will ap|pear to him exigencies may require, to &s;erve the cau&s;e of liberty and the freedom of the people. Citizen Genet will lend the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his good offices to all the French citizens who &s;hall have recour&s;e to him, and who&s;e conduct &s;hall be unexceptionable. But the Executive Council under&s;tands that this protection &s;hall in no ca&s;e contravene the laws of the country, and &s;hall not extend to people of doubtful character, ba|ni&s;hed from their country, or to citizens who&s;e conduct &s;hall be repre|hen&s;ible. Citizen Genet will avoid as much as he can tho&s;e ridiculous di&s;putes about etiquette, which &s;o much occupied the old diplomacy. The repre&s;entatives of other powers are not, however, to be &s;uffered to attempt to deprive France, become free, of that precedence it enjoyed under its ancient forms. The Executive Council informs Citizen Genet, for his regulation of the conduct which they wi&s;h to be followed by the mini&s;ters of the French Republic, if di&s;putes &s;hould ari&s;e re&s;pect|ing the ceremony and the precedence between them and the repre&s;en|tatives of other powers.</P>
<P>The intention of the council is, that the mini&s;ters of the nation &s;hould declare without re&s;erve, that the French people &s;ee in all other people their brethren and their equals, and that they de&s;ire to remove every idea of &s;uperiority or precedence; but that if any &s;tate, mi&s;taking the genero&s;ity of the&s;e principles, pretends to any particular di&s;tinction, and endeavours to obtain it by any &s;teps direct or indirect, the mini&s;ters of the French people &s;hall then in&s;i&s;t on all the prerogatives the French power has at any time enjoyed; the nation determining that in that ca&s;e its mini&s;ters &s;hould defend tho&s;e rights, being certain that the na|tion will make them re&s;pected.</P>
<P>As to the ceremonies of his fir&s;t audience, the delivery of his creden|tials, and his communications with the Federal government, Citizen Genet will conform him&s;elf to tho&s;e rules which the Congre&s;s &s;hall have e&s;tabli&s;hed for all the diplomatic corps in this re&s;pect; exceptions only offend; general rules wound no one.</P>
<P>Such are the political objects tru&s;ted to the zeal of Citizen Genet; the Executive Council will give him particular in&s;tructions upon the con|&s;ular
<PB N="6" REF="047056_0006_10229814BB11F6A8">affairs with which he will be charged, upon the negociation rela|tive to the liquidation of the debt of the United States, upon the &s;up|plies for the Colonies, upon tho&s;e which the marine and war depart|ments call for, and upon the negociations which Citizen Ternant was charged to &s;et on foot with the United Sates to induce them to furni&s;h corn, flour, and &s;alt provi&s;ions on account of their debt.</P>
<P>With the mini&s;ter for foreign affairs Citizen Genet will corre&s;pond upon the&s;e different objects, and it is from him that he will receive the nation's orders. His communications with the other mini&s;ters will only extend to the details of admini&s;tration, relative to their re&s;pective de|partments, and he will be careful to give di&s;tinct information to the mini&s;ter for foreign affairs, to the end that he may have always before his eyes the whole of the operations of the French agents with foreign powers.</P>

<HEAD>Extract from a &s;upplement to the in&s;tructions given to <HI>CITIZEN GENET,</HI> Mini&s;ter and Plenipotentiary of the French Republic to the United States of America.</HEAD>
<P>THE Executive Council wi&s;h that a new treaty, founded upon a ba&s;is more liberal and more fraternal than that of 1778, may be concluded as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. As, however, they cannot conceal that in the actual &s;tate of Europe a negociation of this kind may be &s;ubject to many impediments, whether brought about by &s;ecret manoeuvres of the Eng|li&s;h mini&s;ter and his parti&s;ans at Philadelphia, by the timidity of certain members of the federal government, who, notwith&s;tanding their known patrioti&s;m, have always &s;hewn the &s;tronge&s;t aver&s;ion to every mea&s;ure which might be unplea&s;ant to England, they think it right for the pre|&s;ent, that Citizen Genet &s;hould draw every advantage which the pro|vi&s;ions of the &s;ub&s;i&s;ting treaty &s;ecure to the Republic, until a new com|pact has more clearly and fully defined and enlarged them.</P>
<P>In this view, whichexi&s;ting circum&s;tances render particularly important, Citizen Genet is expre&s;sly enjoined to make him&s;elf thoroughly ma&s;ter of the &s;en&s;e of the treaty of 1778, and to be watchful in the execution of the articles which are favourable to the commerce and navigation of the French Republic, and he will endeavour to &s;atisfy the Americans, that the engagements which may appear burthen&s;ome to them, are the ju&s;t
<PB N="7" REF="047056_0007_102298181DF7F770">price of that Independence which the French nation contributed to acquire for them.</P>
<P>In the probable ca&s;e of a maritime war, Citizen Genet will employ all the means in his power to procure a religious ob&s;ervance of the 17th, 21&s;t, and 22d articles of the treaty of commerce, by which the contracting parties engage freely to admit the prizes made by either of the parties from his enemies, and have renounced the right of permitting their citizens to &s;erve under the flag of a foreigner again&s;t the ve&s;&s;els of their re&s;pective <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, or even to admit into their ports the prizes of for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">rs, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the arming or &s;upplying of foreign privateers.</P>

It would be moreover to be feared that the fitting out in American ports Engli&s;h armaments, or &s;uch as were pretended to be &s;o, would in|duce a number of individuals of the northern &s;tates, remarkable for their boldne&s;s and activity, to accept of Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;ions, and di&s;|tre&s;s and injure our commerce. Without doubt neither the Congre&s;s or the Executive power of the United Sates would approve a conduct &s;o little conformable to the ties of friend&s;hip and good under&s;tanding which &s;ub&s;i&s;t between the two nations; but the great extent of the Engli&s;h commerce in America now become free, the prodigious num|ber of its factors and of the emi&s;&s;aries of George the IIId. the means of corruption, which their &s;ituation and their local acquaintance give them, would render the&s;e expeditions the more frequent, as it would be &s;o ea&s;y to deceive the vigilance of government by concealed equipments. Citizen Genet is therefore particularly enjoined to watch, by the con&s;uls and commercial agents, the conduct of the Engli&s;h in the different ports, to in&s;i&s;t rigorou&s;ly upon the execution of the 17th, 21&s;t, and 22d articles of the treaty of 1778, and to prevent in the American ports all equipments, unle&s;s upon account of the French nation, and the admi&s;|&s;ion of any prize, except tho&s;e which &s;hall have been made by the ve&s;&s;els of the republic. He will take care to explain him&s;elf upon this object with the dignity and energy of the repre&s;entative of a great people, who, in faithfully fulfilling their engagements, know how to make their right re&s;pected.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as circum&s;tances permit efficacious negociations concerning a new treaty of commerce, Citizen Genet will not lo&s;e &s;ight of &s;tipulat|ing po&s;itively and without re&s;erve for a reciprocal exemption from the
<PB N="8" REF="047056_0008_1022981ACD49CB60">duty on tonnage, avoided under different pretences, from many years pa&s;t by the American government, though expre&s;sly granted by the 5th article of the pre&s;ent treaty.</P>
<P>The mutual naturalization of French and American citizens, in com|mercial re&s;pects, propo&s;ed by Mr. Jeffer&s;on and approved of by the Executive Council, will render this exemption from the duty on ton|nage le&s;s offen&s;ive for the powers claiming a participation of the &s;ame favour by virtue of their treaties, for the ca&s;us federis will be entirely changed with re&s;pect to them.</P>
<P>The reciprocal guarantee of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the two nations &s;tipu|lated in the 11th article of the treaty of 1778, can be e&s;tabli&s;hed upon generous principles, which have been already pointed out, and &s;hall equally be an e&s;&s;ential clau&s;e in the new treaty which will be propo&s;ed. The Executive Council in con&s;equence recommend, e&s;pecially to Ci|tizen Genet, to &s;ound early the di&s;po&s;ition of the American government, and to make it a condition &s;ine qua non, of their free commerce with the We&s;t Indies &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the United States. It nearly concerns the peace and pro&s;perity of the French nation, that a people who&s;e re&s;ources increa&s;e beyond all calculation, and whom nature hath placed &s;o near our rich colonies, &s;hould become intere&s;ted, by their own engage|ments, in the pre&s;ervation of the&s;e i&s;lands. Citizen Genet will find the le&s;s difficulty in making this propo&s;ition reli&s;hed in the United Sates, as the great trade which will be the reward of it, will indemnify them ul|timately for the &s;acrifices which they may make at the out&s;et; and the Americans cannot be ignorant of the great di&s;proportion between their re&s;ources and tho&s;e of the French Republic, and that for a very long pe|riod the guarantee a&s;ked of them will be little el&s;e than nominal for them, while that on our part will be real, and we &s;hall immediately put our&s;elves in a &s;tate to fulfil it, in &s;ending to the American ports a &s;uffici|ent force to put them beyond in&s;ult and to facilitate their communication with the i&s;lands and with France. Fully to in&s;ure the &s;ucce&s;s of the&s;e negociations, and to render nugatory in the United States tho&s;e &s;candalous in&s;inuations &s;o clande&s;tinely &s;pread through Europe by the enemies of the Republic, the Executive Council &s;pecially direct Citizen Genet to adhere to the forms e&s;tabli&s;hed for official communications with the United States, between the government and foreign agents, and not to permit him&s;elf to take any &s;tep, or make any overture, which can give umbrage to the Americans in regard to the con&s;titution which they have cho&s;en, and which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tlers in many points from the principles e&s;tabli&s;hed in France.</P>
<P>The emi&s;&s;aries and parti&s;ans of George III. the emigrants, and the Hi&s;paniola refugees, who are found in great numbers in the principal
<PB N="9" REF="047056_0009_1022981DB127E490">cities of the United States, and who have already infected them with their fal&s;ehoods, will not fail to watch the mini&s;ter of the Republic, and to give all his mea&s;ures the mo&s;t malicious con&s;truction. An open and patriotic conduct can alone put him beyond the reach of calumny and mi&s;con&s;truction. The Executive Council relies, in this re&s;pect, with an entire confidence upon the prudence and known moderation of Citizen Genet.</P>
<P>In order that nothing may delay the conclu&s;ion of the negociations of Citizen Genet with the Americans, and that he may have in his own power all the means which can a&s;&s;i&s;t the pains he will take in the cau&s;e of liberty, the Executive Council has given him the full powers annexed. The Mini&s;ter of the Marine Department will tran&s;mit to him a certain number of blank letters of marque, which he will deliver to &s;uch French or American owners as &s;hall apply for the &s;ame.</P>

<P>YOU will find inclo&s;ed, Citizen, 300 letters of marque, which you will di&s;tribute to the Americans who may fit out and try their chance again&s;t the Engli&s;h, Dutch, Ru&s;&s;ians, Pru&s;&s;ians, and Au&s;trians.</P>
<P>The means taken in France to regi&s;ter them in the Office of Cla&s;&s;es, will be &s;upplied by that of regi&s;tering them in the Chancery Office of the Con&s;ulates of France, &s;ituate in the ports where the armed ve&s;&s;els may be fitted out, or in the neare&s;t ports to them. You will take care to number and &s;ign the&s;e, to keep an exact regi&s;ter, and to give me an account of the di&s;po&s;al of them by every ve&s;&s;el bound from the ports of the United States to tho&s;e of the Republic.</P>
<P>I add to this inclo&s;ure twenty copies of each of the laws of the 31&s;t January and 2d February la&s;t.</P>
<P>The laws relative to the encouragements granted to prizes and to their di&s;tribution, will be &s;oon pa&s;&s;ed for France. I &s;hall tran&s;mit them to you as &s;oon as I receive them.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="047056_0010_10224A764A87D4D0">
Foreign built ve&s;&s;els, the entry of which had been prohibited In 1791, may, for the pre&s;ent, be armed in France, and partake of all the advan|tages granted to tho&s;e built in the docks of the Republic.</P>
<P>This regulation is of too much moment not to ha&s;ten you in com|municating it to all tho&s;e who, knowing the law of 13th May, 1791, may think them&s;elves deprived of the power of introducing their ve&s;|&s;els into France.</P>
<P>You will, doubtle&s;s, think it right to regulate your mea&s;ures and your conduct by the prudence and di&s;cretion which your character requires in the exi&s;ting circum&s;tances, to contribute as much as in your power to the good of the Republic, the &s;ucce&s;s of its armaments, and the de|&s;truction of its enemies commerce.</P>

<P>YOU will find hereunto annexed, Citizen, commi&s;&s;ions for the con|ductors of prizes, which you will continue to di&s;tribute to the captains, with the letters of marque, according to the numbers of captures they &s;hall think they may be able to make at &s;ea; you will in&s;cribe them under the &s;ame number as the letters of marque. The citizens forming the Provi&s;ional Executive Council of the French Republic, mark the &s;ame number on each of the commi&s;&s;ions delivered to each captain. It has been thought nece&s;&s;ary to adopt this uniform method in all the maritime di&s;tricts.</P>
