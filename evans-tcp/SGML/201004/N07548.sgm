<P>But did you think it recht, <HI>Tom,</HI> to kill the Women and the Weans?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some of us did not, as &s;oon as auld Saunders Kent that (you know he has been an Elder this thirty Year) when he gaid about Duty, the Night before, he &s;ung the 137 <HI>P&s;alm,</HI> where it &s;ays, <Q>happy &s;urely &s;hall he be, they tender little ones, who &s;hall lay hold upon, and them &s;hall da&s;h again&s;t the Stones.</Q> And he read the 15. <HI>Chapter</HI> of 1 <HI>Samuel.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you did all this in the Name of the Lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>T.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, to be &s;ure. We were aw <HI>Pres|byterians.</HI> But that wild Chiel, <HI>Charly Breulluchan</HI> &s;hot an Indian's Doug, while auld <HI>Saunder's</HI> was &s;aying Grace till half a Pint of Whusky. I doubt he has the Pope, or the Heegh-Kirk in his Guts.</P>

<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am afraid all this is wrong. I am a <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> you know, as well as your&s;elf. But I would fain hope that I am a Chri&s;tian al&s;o. Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the Prince of <HI>Peace,</HI> and has taught us the Doctrine of forgiving even our Enemies, as we expect that our heaven|ly Father will forgive us. I am afraid that you have done ami&s;s. Many Things were permitted to the Jews becau&s;e of the Hard|ne&s;s of their Hearts, which the Light of the Go&s;pel has di&s;covered to be wrong. But even the Jews paid the greate&s;t Regard to their Treaties. And the&s;e Indians by Treaties have been acknowledged to be our Friends.</P>
<P>The <HI>Gibeonites</HI> were &s;pared on Account of the publick Faith plighted to them, tho obtained by Fraud and Fal&s;hood. And tho <HI>Schechem</HI> had committed a Crime for which he ought to have &s;uffered Death: Yet after Peace was made, we find the good old Patriarch <HI>Jacob,</HI> on his Death-Bed, bit|terly cur&s;ing his Sons, for breaking the Peace. In&s;truments of Cruelty are in your Habitations. O my Soul come not thou into your Secrets, unto your A&s;&s;embly, mine
<PB N="7" REF="009635_0006_0F77386FC70A4AB8">Honour, be not thou united: For in your Anger you have &s;lain Man, and in your&s;elf will you houghed Cattle. Cur&s;ed be your Anger, for it was fierce; and your Wrath for it was cruel. I pray that you may not be di&s;per&s;ed or &s;cattered in the true <HI>I&s;rael</HI> of GOD.</P>
