<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>SOME time ago I was &s;olicited by Mr. We&s;ley, to &s;end him an account of my experience and travels. I was at a lo&s;s to know what was be&s;t to be done in this ca&s;e; but after &s;ome con&s;ideration, I informed him that I would comply with his reque&s;t. After I began to write, I found &s;ome &s;cruples in my mind which I communicated to him. But &s;ome time af|ter, I received a &s;econd, and then a third letter, in which he intreated me to lay a&s;ide my &s;cruples and comply with his reque&s;t.</P>
<P>Having at length prepared the piece, I &s;ent it from New-York in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> which I under&s;tood was ca&s;t away, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that he did not receive it; of which I had no <HI>certain</HI> account, till he informed me in another letter; and that if it di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> come to hand &s;oon, it would not be in time for him to &s;ee it: which was, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="iv" REF="023401_0003_0FBF588A9A8EA138">the ca&s;e; for whil&s;t I was &s;itting in my room in Albany, fini&s;hing a letter to be enclo&s;ed with it, a friend came in, and pre&s;ented me with a news-paper, in which I read the account of the death of that eminent &s;ervant of God.</P>
<P>I have &s;ince con&s;ented to have it print|ed in America, with very little alterati|on, except an enlargement. In tru&s;t in this my eye hath been &s;ingle, and my in|tention pure. In keeping my regular journal, it was not uncommon for me to write the exerci&s;es of the day before I clo&s;ed my eyes in &s;leep. But &s;hould there be any mi&s;repre&s;entations, or any cir|cum&s;tances exaggerated (which I think is not the ca&s;e) I hope my reader will have charity enough to impute it either to mi&s;take, or wrong information. I can appeal to the Searcher of hearts when I &s;ay, in the relation of any &s;ubject I had rather be under than over the truth.</P>
<P>I doubt not, but &s;ame real facts which I have related, will appear &s;trange to
<PB N="v" REF="023401_0004_0FBF588CD35B0848">&s;ome people. Great and glorious di&s;cove|ries hath the Lord made to me, in vari|ous parts of his vineyard, at various times; in&s;omuch, that I think it my duty not to keep &s;ilence; but publi&s;h to the children of men the great goodne&s;s of a benevolent God. Within &s;ixteen years, I have travelled more than &s;ixty thou&s;and miles, in the glorious work of <HI>planting</HI> or <HI>&s;preading</HI> the Go&s;pel; and when I look back, the time &s;eems very &s;hort, and I often mourn under a &s;en&s;e of my un|profitablene&s;s, and feel willing to &s;pend the remainder of my days in the &s;ervice of &s;o good a God.</P>
<P>I have an ardent de&s;ire to be u&s;eful, and it greatly rejoices my heart when I &s;ee or hear of precious &s;inners embracing the overtures of mercy. I earne&s;tly ad|vi&s;e all tho&s;e into who&s;e hands this &s;hort diary may fall, to read it with earne&s;t prayer; then peradventure it will have its de&s;ired effect on their hearts. In this
<PB N="vi" REF="023401_0005_0FBF588E56166F28">account I did by no means intend to gratify the curio&s;ity, or to tickle the ears of tho&s;e who live in plea&s;ure. I never aimed at this from the pulpit; the truth of which tho&s;e who know me can te&s;tify; and in my writing I aim at the &s;ame thing&mdash; to be in&s;trumental in bringing precious &s;ouls to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>What &s;hall I &s;ay to God's dear chil|dren&mdash;the advice of St. John is, <HI>"lit|tle children, love one another."</HI> And <HI>"perfect love ca&s;teth out fear."</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t entreat all tho&s;e who are &s;tran|gers to pure religion, to endeavour to take the following &s;teps before they clo&s;e their eyes in &s;leep, viz. <HI>1.</HI> Set down and count the co&s;t&mdash;con&s;ider the &s;tate which your &s;oul is in&mdash;meditate on the &s;hortne&s;s of time, the certainty of death and judgment, and the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of a preparation for futurity. <HI>2.</HI> Turn your back on every thing which you know to be &s;inful. Sin cau&s;ed the Son of God to groan and die. Why, O why then
<PB N="vii" REF="023401_0006_0FBF5892291A6E30">&s;hould we live and delight in &s;in? O! behold &s;in driving, as it were, the &s;pear into the &s;ide of the Redeemer, and &s;ly from it as from deadly poi&s;on. <HI>3.</HI> Be|take your&s;elf to prayer; how your kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e before the eternal Judge, and call on the &s;trong for &s;trength. <HI>4.</HI> Form a re&s;olu|tion in the name of the Lord, that the remainder of your days &s;hall be &s;pent in a life of piety. <HI>5.</HI> Believe in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and you &s;hall be &s;aved. You &s;hall feel your &s;ins forgiven. The guilt, power, and love of &s;in &s;hall be removed, and your &s;oul &s;hall be happy in God. Till this is your ble&s;&s;ed experience, your &s;oul will be unhappy, and if you die without it, your &s;oul will for ever &s;ink into hell.</P>
<P>O! dear &s;inners, my heart is enlarg|ed towards you; repent and turn to the Lord, and he will in mercy meet you. "Now is the accepted time, &amp;c." The la&s;t trump will &s;oon be blown, and all mankind mu&s;t appear at his tremendous

<HEAD>SECTION I. <HI>From my Childhood till my Conver&s;ion.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Was born in the year of our Lord 1752. My parents were of the church of Eng|land; and brought up their children in that way. My father was a very moral man, and thought by his neighbours to be a very good Chri&s;tians and my mother was a wo|man that feared the Lord. I was (as my parents informed me) from my infancy prene to pride, &s;elf-will, and &s;tubbornne&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">: which I afterwards &s;en&s;ibly felt, to the &s;or|row of my heart. My father's grandfather was an emigrant from Great-Britain; and numbered among the fir&s;t &s;ettlers in the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|vince of Maryland.</P>
<P>I was very early taught the Lord's pray|er, creed, and ten commandments, toge|ther with the catechi&s;m of the church of England; and was in early life re&s;trained by my render parents from open &s;in. It plea&s;|ed the Lord to remove my dear mother in|to an awful eternity when I was young. But I &s;hall never forget the admonitions
<PB N="10" REF="023401_0009_0FBF5899AB3BFE40">which &s;he gave me. One Lord's-day when I was about &s;even years of age, my mother was retired (I was fitting by her &s;ide) and whil&s;t &s;he was reading the two la&s;t chapters of the Revelations, when &s;he came to the place where it &s;peaks of the tree and wa|ter of life, &s;he made a full &s;top, and with eyes uplifted to heaven, and tears flowing down, "O!" &s;aid &s;he, "that I may be happy enough to eat of that fruit, and drink of that water, in my heavenly Father's kingdom!" I believe the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit was with her, and I felt the divine operations: but I knew <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">im not; for we lived in a dark time. One day when I was about nine years of age, as I was walking alone in the field, it was as &s;trongly uppre&s;t on my mind, as if I had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eard a voice, "A&s;k and it &s;hall be given you." I was immediately de&s;irous to know what it meant, and it occurred to my mind, that this was a &s;criptural promi&s;e. But I, having no ideas of &s;piritual things, immediately ran to the hou&s;e and told my elder brother, it was revealed to me, that I &s;hould be very rich: &s;hortly after this, I was by my&s;elf and there was a que&s;tion a&s;k|ed me, "Do you know what a &s;aint is?" I pau&s;ed a while in my mind, and un&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ver|ed,
<PB N="11" REF="023401_0010_0FBF589AF4118760">there are no &s;aints in this our day on earth. The &s;ame voice replied, "a &s;aint is one that is wholly given up to God." And immediately in idea, I &s;aw &s;uch a per&s;on who appeared the mo&s;t beautiful of all I ever beheld. I was affected, and prayed to the Lord to make me a &s;aint, and it was &s;trong|ly impre&s;t upon my mind that I &s;hould be one; and a &s;pirit of joy &s;prung up within me; but I had no one to open to me the way of &s;alvation.</P>
<P>Some time after this, a great affliction be|fel my father's family: fir&s;t a &s;i&s;ter, then my mother, and then two &s;ervants were remo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ed into an awful eternity. The ninth day of my &s;i&s;ter's illne&s;s, &s;he a&s;ked for nouri&s;h|ment, and eat heartily for one in her low &s;tate. After &s;he had done &s;he de&s;ired to be rai&s;ed in the bed; I am, &s;aid &s;he, about to leave the world. The family were called to|gether, and were in a flood of tears: "Weep not for me," &s;aid &s;he, "for I am not afraid to die. I am going to my Je&s;us, who will do more for me than any of you can do." I be|lieve her &s;oul was happy. And the affect|ing exhortation which &s;he gave will neve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be forgotten by me. When <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne de&s;ired to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> down, bidding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="12" REF="023401_0011_0FBF589C93947380">well. And within a few minutes, with a &s;miling countenance, bid the world adieu. From her infancy her con&s;cientiou&s;ne&s;s and uprightne&s;s were noticed by all who knew her. It was not common to find her on the Lord's-day without a Bible; her old uncle, who was a communicant in the church, u&s;ed to &s;ay, "Sally lives as &s;he would wi&s;h to die." From this time a melancholy gloom hung over me, and I frequently went alone to weep. I knew I wanted &s;omething, but what it was I knew not; for I had none to take me by the hand, and lead me into the narrow path. I know the ble&s;&s;ed and fixing my &s;o that I have been melt|ed into tenderne&s;s; but I knew not the way of &s;alvation. About this time it was I bought my&s;elf a pocket Te&s;tament, and fre|quently withdrew and read; and was much affected with the &s;ufferings of our dear Lord. Our unhappy mini&s;ter was a &s;tranger to God and the mo&s;t of his flock, I fear, were in the way to ruin.</P>
<P>When I was about twelve years of age, I was removed to another &s;chool, where af|ter a time I threw off all &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s; and became as wild as the re&s;t of my young play|mates. The mo&s;t of my &s;chool-hours, af|ter
<PB N="13" REF="023401_0012_0FBF589DF183FEB0">I turned fourteen, were taken up in branches of the mathematics and book-keep|ing, and the intervals of my time, in the &s;tudy of a&s;tronomy. I have often continu|ed alone in the &s;tudy of this till after mid|night, without a &s;erious thought of God or my eternal welfare. Between the &s;even|teenth and eighteenth years of my age I left &s;chool, and began to think of living in the world. But alas! I was carele&s;s and car|nal; though what the world calls a moral youth. I was &s;ond of plea&s;ure, and loved this world more than God. Oh! what rea|&s;on have I to prai&s;e God for his goodne&s;s, in pur&s;uing me with the overtures of mer|cy. About this time it was, that there be|gan to be much &s;aid of the people called Me|thodi&s;ts in Baltimore county where I lived. Many went out to hear them, and I among the re&s;t, but the place was &s;o crowded I could not get into the hou&s;e: but from what I could under&s;tand, I thought they preach|ed the truth, and did by no means dare to join with the multitude in per&s;ecuting them: but thought I would let them alone, and keep clo&s;e to my own church. Oh! tho&s;e &s;oul damning &s;ins, pride and unbelief, which kept me from God and his people!</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="023401_0013_0FBF589F83015920">
Ble&s;&s;ed be God, it was not long after, that his holy Spirit began again to work powerfully with me. One day as I was riding home, I met a young man who had been hearing the Methodi&s;ts, and had got his heart touched under the world. He &s;topt me in the road, and began to talk &s;o &s;weet|ly about Je&s;us and his people, and recom|mended him to me in &s;uch a winning man|ner, that I was deeply convinced there was a reality in that religion, and that it was time for me to think &s;eriou&s;ly on the mat|ter.</P>
<P>Not many days had pa&s;&s;ed, before a lit|tle book fell into my hands, called Ru&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l's &s;even &s;ermons. By this book I was advi&s;ed to make as exact an e&s;timate of all my &s;ins as po&s;&s;ible; I did &s;o, and found they were numerous, for I began to &s;ee my&s;elf in the go&s;pel gla&s;s; and many were the tears I &s;hed over this book. And I promi&s;ed an amend|ment of life; but my repentance was too much like the early dew or morning rain. Still the way of &s;alvation was not open to me, and there was an unwillingne&s;s in me to &s;ubmit. But as my dear Lord was not willing that I &s;hould peri&s;h, his good Spirit &s;till &s;trove with me. One day as I was pa&s;&s;|ing
<PB N="15" REF="023401_0014_0FBF58A6DE2B82C0">over a rapid &s;tream, a log on which I had frequently gone, gave way, and I was near being &s;wept down the &s;tream; after &s;truggling a while, I got out, though much wounded among the &s;harp rocks. This que|ry &s;truck my mind with great weight, "What would have become of your &s;oul, had you been drowned?" I wept bitterly, and prayed to the Lord under a &s;en&s;e of my guilt. Still my &s;tubborn heart was not willing to &s;ubmit, though I began to carry a little hell in my bo&s;om.</P>
<P>In May 1772, as I was riding out one afternoon, I went down a de&s;cent over a large broad rock; my hor&s;e &s;tumbled and threw me; and with the fall on the rock, and the hor&s;e blundering over me, I was beaten out of my &s;en&s;es. I was alone, and how long I lay I know not; but when I recovered, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, I found my|&s;elf on my knees, with my hands and eyes rai&s;ed to heaven, crying to God for mer|cy. It came &s;trongly into my mind that had I then been taken, I &s;hould have dropt into hell. I felt my mi&s;ery, and prai&s;ed God, as well as I knew how, for my de|liverance; and before I moved from the place, I promi&s;ed to &s;erve him all the days
<PB N="16" REF="023401_0015_0FBF58AF03E8DEA8">of my life. But before I aro&s;e from my knees, all my pain of body was removed, and I felt nearly as well as ever I did in my life. I al&s;o felt the drawing of God's Spirit, and in a mea&s;ure &s;aw a beauty in Je&s;us: but I did not know that my &s;ins were forgiven; neither was the plan of &s;al|vation clearly open to me; but I went on my way determined, by grace, to be a fol|lower of Chri&s;t. All the Antinomians in the world, could not make me believe, that a man cannot feel &s;weet drawings be|fore he experiences ju&s;tification.</P>
<P>I now procured a collection of the be&s;t religious books that I could; among&s;t which were, the writings of Mr. Hervey, the tra|vels of true godline&s;s, and Alleine's alarm to the unconverted: for as yet I had not &s;een any of Mr. We&s;ley's publications nor conver&s;ed on religious &s;ubjects with any of the Methodi&s;ts.</P>
<P>As I lived a retired life, I frequently read, prayed, and wept till after midnight: and often withdrew to the woods and other private places for prayer. In &s;ome mea|&s;ure my name was already ca&s;t out as evil, though I was a&s;hamed to let any one know the exerci&s;es of my mind, or that I u&s;ed
<PB N="17" REF="023401_0016_0FBF58B063EF62F8">&s;ecret prayer: and in order to conceal it when in company, I have frequently griev|ed the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, by joining in trifling conver&s;ation. For I was much afraid of being thought a hypocrite. But the Holy Spirit &s;till pur&s;ued me, and I attended &s;trict|ly to the duties of the family, over which I was placed. I had as yet heard very few Methodi&s;t &s;ermons; and the devil &s;trove very hard to keep me from going among tho&s;e people. Some time after, my late well-tried friend and brother Mr. F. A. came to our county: I went to hear him one evening at R. W.'s. The place was crowded; however I got to the door and &s;at down, but he had not preached long, before I &s;en&s;ibly felt the word: and his doc|trine &s;eemed as &s;alve to a fe&s;tering wound. I heard him with delight, and bathed in tears could have remained there till the ri&s;|ing of the &s;un, the time pa&s;&s;ed &s;o &s;weetly away: I was delightfully drawn, and great|ly a&s;toni&s;hed to find a per&s;on go on &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|ently, without his &s;ermon before him. I &s;uppo&s;e hundreds of thoughts pa&s;&s;ed through my mind. But I returned home with glad|ne&s;s, fully per&s;uaded that he was a &s;ervant of God, and that he preached in a way
<PB N="18" REF="023401_0017_0FBF58B19E6D0830">I had not heard before. I followed him to another preaching place; and &s;ixing my at|tentive eye upon him, I found him to be a workman that need not be a&s;hamed, right|ly dividing the word. He began to wind about me in &s;uch a manner that I found my &s;ins in clu&s;ters, as it were, around me: and the law in its purity, probing to the very bottom, and di&s;covering the defects of my heart. I was ready to cry out, "How does this &s;tranger know me &s;o well!" After &s;er|mon was ended, I wi&s;hed not to &s;peak to any one, but returned home in a very &s;o|lemn manner.</P>
<P>My father began to be troubled about me, and came to &s;ee me. We &s;at up talk|ing till near midnight. "I have no objec|tion," &s;aid he, "to your being religious; but why would you turn from the church?" I replied, I have no intention to leave the church, but whenever per&s;ons become &s;eri|ous, they are called Methodi&s;ts, and their names are ca&s;t out as evil. After we part|ed I found great tenderne&s;s of heart, and &s;hed many tears in private, and many pro|mi&s;es occurred to my mind; I loved the Methodi&s;ts, and yet the enemy of my &s;oul kept me at a di&s;tance from them. Unbelief
<PB N="19" REF="023401_0018_0FBF58B318ABE718">and pride kept me from the comforts of a&s;&s;urance.</P>
<P>In April 1773, my brother John was taken dangerou&s;ly ill, &s;o that his life was de&s;paired of. One Lord's-day, many of our relations and others came to &s;ee him, expecting every minute he would breathe his la&s;t. I was greatly concerned on ac|count of his &s;oul, which to appearance was ju&s;t launching into eternity, and my fear was that he was unprepared. I went round to the back part of the bed, and kneeling down, I prayed earne&s;tly to the Lord to have mercy on his &s;oul. After I had done praying, I perceived his lips were moving, but could not hear a word that he &s;poke, till I put my ear clo&s;e to his mouth (to appearance he was ju&s;t going) and heard him &s;ay, "Lord, thou knowe&s;t I am unprepared to die, have mercy on me, and rai&s;e me up, and give me a longer &s;pace, and I will &s;erve thee; thy Spirit has often &s;trove with me, but I have re|jected thee," &amp;c. Thus did he plead with the Lord for a con&s;iderable time. He knew, and &s;o did I, the moment of time when the Lord an&s;wered prayer, and granted him a longer &s;pace. Immediately
<PB N="20" REF="023401_0019_0FBF58B47722C2E8">I ro&s;e from my knees, and told the waiting company they need not be unea&s;y, for the Lord would rai&s;e him again; in&s;tantly the di&s;order turned, he fell into a do&s;e, and within a few days was able to walk about his room. After his recovery, I conver&s;ed with him on the &s;ubject, and he told me that he &s;aw death, that he was &s;ummoned to appear in the world of &s;pirits, and that hell was his doom. "I know," &s;aid he, "when a reprieve in an&s;wer to prayer was &s;ent, the blow averted, and the tender thread lengthened, on condition that I would give the remainder of my days to the Lord." A few years after he was real|ly changed in heart, and lived two years and eight months happy in the &s;ervice of God, died a witne&s;s of perfect love.</P>
<P>About this time my dear Lord laid me under his hand, and I was brought nigh unto death. During the time of my ill|ne&s;s I was in a very &s;trange way; I lay on my bed &s;inging prai&s;es to God without any dread of death; I &s;elt my mind ea&s;y; I thought if I was removed I &s;hould go to Heaven; I was willing to die; I did not know my &s;ins were forgiven; but I felt a &s;trong hope, yet I was not fully acquainted
<PB N="21" REF="023401_0020_0FBF58B89A1C3FF8">with the plan of &s;alvation. Who can tell what &s;tate my &s;oul was in? I was a good Churchman, but a poor Methodi&s;t. Ble&s;|&s;ed be the name of the Lord! He delights not in the death of a &s;inner, for he rai&s;ed me up again; but &s;till the enemy of my &s;oul &s;trove to keep me from among&s;t God's dear, de&s;pi&s;ed children.</P>
<P>The Augu&s;t following, it plea&s;ed the Lord to take my father into eternity.&mdash; Surely it was painful to lo&s;e the tendere&s;t of parents. From my earlie&s;t knowledge of his family, con&s;i&s;ting of about twenty in number, I do not remember ever to have heard an oath &s;worn either by black or white; and it was a rare thing for him to correct either children or &s;ervants, though &s;till there was a trembling at his word. I frequently vi&s;ited him in the time of his illne&s;s (for he had a long and tedi|ous &s;ickne&s;s) and he &s;eemed very fond of my company; and I have rea&s;on to believe he went happy out of this dangerous world. Being now left in the entire charge of a family, and the &s;ettlement of my fa|ther's bu&s;ine&s;s mo&s;tly devolving on me, I was &s;urrounded with many cares and trou|bles, which were no help to the affairs of
<PB N="22" REF="023401_0021_0FBF58B9B0CB5D10">my &s;alvation. The devil &s;trove hard to drive away all my good de&s;ires, but &s;till I attended con&s;tantly to my &s;ecret devotions, though at times cold enough. It was not long after the death of my father, that I had a particular interview with the new pari&s;h mini&s;ter, who was a very clever man, of a moral character, and much re|&s;pected in the place: I was a con&s;tant at|tendant on his mini&s;try, and frequently conver&s;ed with him on divine &s;ubjects. He told me the Methodi&s;ts carried matters too far; that a man could not know his &s;ins were forgiven: and all we might expect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">his life was a hope &s;pringing from an upright life. This doctrine exactly tallied with my experience, and was food for my fallen nature. I &s;oon fully agreed with hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in &s;entiment, and pleaded that no man could know his &s;ins forgiven in this world. The grand enemy began now to exerci&s;e my mind in another way; name|ly to &s;eek a literary qualification for the mini&s;try in the church. This hung upon me for a con&s;iderable time; and I applied my&s;elf to reading and &s;tudy for that pur|po&s;e, often con&s;ulting my new coun&s;ellor. The Spirit of the Lord at times &s;trove
<PB N="23" REF="023401_0022_0FBF58BD9914E218">very powerfully, and I was frequently afraid that all was not well with me, e&s;pecially when I was under Methodi&s;t preaching. To the&s;e people I was drawn; but it was like death to me; for I thought I had ra|ther &s;erve God in any way than among them; at the &s;ame time &s;omething within would tell me they were right. Being amazingly agitated in mind, I at length came to this conclu&s;ion, to give up my former pur&s;uits and bend my mind to the improvement of my worldly property, and &s;erve God in a private manner. I now &s;et out as it were in full pur&s;uit of bu&s;ine&s;s with an expectation of accumulating <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> riches of the world.</P>
<P>During the time of my &s;elf-&s;ecure &s;tate, I had the form of godline&s;s, attended the church con&s;tantly, and &s;ometimes went <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> hear the Methodi&s;ts: I fa&s;ted once a we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k, prayed frequently every day in &s;ecret pla|ces, endeavoured to attend &s;trictly to the Sabbath, often reproved open &s;in, and denied my&s;elf of what the world calls plea|&s;ure. I was &s;o fa&s;t &s;et in my way, that I thought I &s;hould certainly go to Heaven. And if at any time I was overtaken, I would endeavour to mend my pace and pray more
<PB N="24" REF="023401_0023_0FBF58C02E3BE060">frequently. I cannot &s;ay I was always with|out doubts; for often, under Methodi&s;t preaching, my poor foundation would &s;hake, e&s;pecially under the preaching of dear bro|ther G. S. and I would &s;carcely recover my hope for many days; then I would be tempted to think they were a deluded peo|ple, and I would go among them no more: but &s;till I was drawn again and again. I &s;tood in a manner between the children of God and the world. When I was with the people of God I would endeavour to confute them; and when I was among their enemies, I plead their cau&s;e.</P>
<P>One day being at a di&s;tance from home, I met with a zealous Methodi&s;t exhorter. He a&s;ked me if I was born again? I told him I had a hope that I was. Do you know, &s;aid he, that your &s;ins are forgiven? No, replied I, neither do I expect that know|ledge in this world. I perceive, &s;aid he, that you are in the broad road to hell, and if you die in this &s;tate you will be damned. The Scripture, &s;aid I, tells us that the tree is known by its fruit; and our Lord like|wi&s;e condemns ra&s;h judgment. What have you &s;een or known of my life that induced you to judge me in &s;uch a manner&mdash;I pity
<PB N="25" REF="023401_0024_0FBF58C2B9D4FA38">you, &s;aid I, and turned my back on him. But I could not ea&s;ily forget the words of that pious young man, for they were as &s;pears running through me.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate I continued till June 1775. The ble&s;&s;ed morning I &s;hall never forget! In the night I went to bed as u&s;ual; and &s;lept till day break&mdash;Ju&s;t as I awoke, I was alarmed by an awful voice, "Awake, &s;in|ner, for you are not prepared to die." This was as &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed on my mind, as if it had been a human voice as loud as thun|der. I was in&s;tantly &s;mitten with convic|tion in a manner I had not been before. I &s;tarted from my pillow, and cried out, Lord have mercy on my &s;oul! As it was about the commencement of the late unhappy war, and there was to be a general review that day near my hou&s;e, I had promi&s;ed my&s;elf much &s;atisfaction; for I was a profe&s;&s;ed friend to the American cau&s;e: however, in|&s;tead of giving my attendance, I pa&s;&s;ed the morning away in &s;olitude; and in the after|noon went out and heard a Methodi&s;t &s;er|mon. In &s;orrow I went, and in &s;orrow re|turned; and in &s;orrow the night pa&s;&s;ed a|way. None but tho&s;e that have experienced
<PB N="26" REF="023401_0025_0FBF58CCC96768E0">the like exerci&s;es, can form an idea of what I underwent for &s;everal days.</P>
<P>The devil and the enmity of my heart &s;eemed to ri&s;e higher and higher. On the Tue&s;day following, in the afternoon I heard Mr. D. R. preach; and was &s;o oppre&s;t that I was &s;carce able to &s;upport under my bur|den. After preaching I called in with D. R. at Mrs. G&mdash;'s, and &s;taid till about nine o'clock. On my way home being much di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed, I alighted from my hor&s;e in a lone|ly wood, and bowed my knees before the Lord; I &s;en&s;ibly felt two &s;pirits, one on each hand. The good &s;pirit &s;et forth to my inmo&s;t mind, the beauties of religion; and I &s;eemed almo&s;t ready to lay hold on my Saviour. Oh! unbelief! &s;oul damning &s;in! it kept me from my Je&s;us. Then would the enemy ri&s;e up on the other hand, and dre&s;s religion in as odious a garb as po&s;|&s;ible; yea, he &s;eemed in a moment of time, to &s;et the world and the things of it in the mo&s;t brilliant colours before me; telling m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, all tho&s;e things &s;hould be mine, if I would give up my fal&s;e notions, and &s;erve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">im. His temptations of a truth might b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> con pared to a &s;weeping rain.

<PB N="27" REF="023401_0026_0FBF58CEAE7C96C8">la&s;t began to give way to the rea&s;oning of the enemy. My tender feelings abated, and my tears were gone; my heart was hard, but I continued on my knees in a kind of meditation; and at length addre&s;&s;ed my Maker thus: Lord, &s;pare me one year more, and by that time I can put my worldly af|fairs in &s;uch a train, that I can &s;erve thee. (I &s;eemed as if I felt the two &s;pirits with me.) The an&s;wer was, "Now is the accept|ed time." I then plead for &s;ix months, but was denied&mdash;one month, no&mdash;I then a&s;ked for one week, the an&s;wer was, "This is the time." For &s;ome time the devil was &s;i|lent, till I was denied one week in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is &s;ervice; then it was he &s;hot a power<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">l dart. "The God," &s;aid he, "you are at|tempting to &s;erve, is a hard Ma&s;ter; and I would have you to de&s;i&s;t from your en|deavour." Carnal people know very little of this kind of exerci&s;e: but it was as per|ceptible to me, as if I had been conver&s;ing with two per&s;ons face to face. As &s;oon as this powerful temptation came, I felt my heart ri&s;e &s;en&s;ibly (I do not &s;ay with enmi|ty) again&s;t my Maker, and immediately I aro&s;e from my knees with the&s;e words, "I will take my own time, and then I will
<PB N="28" REF="023401_0027_0FBF58D030918C48">&s;erve thee." I mounted my hor&s;e with a hard, unbelieving heart, unwilling to &s;ub|mit to Je&s;us. Oh! what a good God had I to deal with! I might in ju&s;tice have been &s;ent to hell.</P>
<P>I had not rode a quarter of a mile, be|&s;ore the Lord met me powerfully with the&s;e words, "The&s;e three years have I come &s;eeking fruit on this &s;ig-tree; and find none." And then the following words were added, "I have come once more to offer you life and &s;alvation, and it is the la&s;t time: chu&s;e, or refu&s;e." I was in|&s;tantly &s;urrounded with a divine power: heaven and hell were di&s;clo&s;ed to view, and life and death were &s;et before me. I do believe if I had rejected this call, mercy would have been for ever taken from me. Man hath power to chu&s;e or refu&s;e in reli|gious matters; otherwi&s;e God would have no rea&s;onable &s;ervice from his creatures. I knew the very in&s;tant, when I &s;ubmitted to the Lord, and was willing that Chri&s;t &s;hould reign over me: I likewi&s;e knew the two &s;ins which I parted with la&s;t, pride and unbelief. I threw the reins of my bridle on my hor&s;e's neck, and putting my hands together, cried out, Lord, I &s;ubmit.
<PB N="29" REF="023401_0028_0FBF58D1C6EDE530">I was le&s;s than nothing in my own &s;ight; and was now, for the fir&s;t time, reconciled to the ju&s;tice of God.

<HEAD>SECTION II. <HI>From my Conver&s;ion till I entered the Con|nection as a Travelling Preacher.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AFTER I found this pearl of great price, my &s;oul was &s;o exceedingly happy, that I &s;eemed as if I wanted to take wing and fly away to heaven. Al|though alone in an unfrequented wood, I was con&s;trained to &s;ound forth the prai&s;es of my dear Redeemer. I thought I &s;hould not be a&s;hamed to publi&s;h it to the ends of the earth. As I drew near to the hou&s;e, the &s;ervants heard me, and came to meet me at the gate in great &s;urpri&s;e. The &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s &s;eemed as &s;o many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> going forth in
<PB N="30" REF="023401_0029_0FBF58DA589DAE78">their Maker's prai&s;e. I called the family together for prayer, but my prayer was turned into prai&s;e.</P>
<P>About midnight I laid down to re&s;t; but my &s;oul was &s;o happy in God, I &s;carcely wi&s;hed for &s;leep; however, at length my eyes were clo&s;ed; but behold! about day-break I awoke, and was &s;trongly tempted by the devil; "Oh!" &s;aid the adver&s;ary, "where is your religion now? It was only a dream." I &s;tarted from my pillow &mdash;I remembered the time and place where I received the ble&s;&s;ing: and was enabled to repel that temptation. Again &s;aid he, "It is all a delu&s;ion." This a&s;&s;ault pained me to the heart. Not feeling as I had done, I began to conclude perhaps it might be &s;o; and betook my&s;elf to the fields and woods, under deep di&s;tre&s;s. I frequently bowed my knees before the Lord; and, ble&s;&s;ed be his dear name, about nine in the morning my beloved Ma&s;ter vi&s;ited my heart with his love. And I think I receiv|ed as great a manife&s;tation as at the fir&s;t. This vi&s;it was attended with an impre&s;&s;io<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to go to &s;uch a place, and declare to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> who might be there, what great things the Lord had done for me. I went to the
<PB N="31" REF="023401_0030_0FBF58DC3B90FA48">hou&s;e, got my hor&s;e, and &s;et out. When I arrived at the place, I found a Methodi&s;t preacher, and &s;everal of my acquaintance. And it was &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed on my mind to deliver my me&s;&s;age. I &s;at down among them, but the cro&s;s was too heavy. I &s;at hours, and grieved the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, till I was brought under heavy trials, yea, deep di&s;tre&s;s of &s;oul; and in that way I return|ed home.</P>
<P>For the good of others, I &s;hall &s;peak of a few days' exerci&s;e on this occa&s;ion. The dear Redeemer left me, or rather hid his face from me: and I had to wade through deep waters. I fa&s;ted and prayed, till I was almo&s;t reduced to a &s;keleton; but did not open my mouth to any one. I was &s;inking into de&s;peration.&mdash;O! how pow|erfully was I hara&s;&s;ed by the devil, day and night! The Saturday following I was walk|ing through the fields; all nature was cloth|ed with beauty and verdure; but I could di&s;cover no charms in aught around me: but was under the deepe&s;t exerci&s;es of mind, and &s;everely tempted of the devil. "Ah," &s;ugge&s;ted he, "where is your God now?" He thru&s;t athei&s;m and dei&s;m again&s;t me; and thus &s;ugge&s;ted to my mind, "You
<PB N="32" REF="023401_0031_0FBF58DDB740AB28">&s;ee you have been deluded; and if you will now take my advice, you will deny every preten&s;ion to this religion. The Methodi&s;ts are a &s;et of enthu&s;ia&s;ts, and you have now a proof of it." Then with what &s;plendor was the world ex|hibited to my imagination: "All the&s;e things," &s;ugge&s;ted he, "will I give you if you will deny that God you have been at|tempting to &s;erve, and pray to him no more." I was &s;unk as low as I could po&s;&s;ibly be; for my mind was encompa&s;&s;ed with darkne&s;s, and the mo&s;t &s;evere di&s;tre&s;s. I was afraid my lips would be forced open to deny the God who made me. Glory, glory to my Lord! who again gave me a view of an opening eternity, and a &s;en&s;e of his dread Maje&s;ty; the &s;ight of which brought me in|to the du&s;t, pro&s;trate with my face to the ground, where I lay for a con&s;iderable time with language &s;imilar to this, if I peri&s;h, it &s;hall be at thy feet, crying for mercy. Thus I lay, till I recovered a gleam of hope that I &s;hould be &s;aved at la&s;t.</P>
<P>I aro&s;e from the earth, and advancing towards the hou&s;e in deep thought, I came to this conclu&s;ion, that I would exclude my&s;elf from the &s;ociety of men, and live
<PB N="33" REF="023401_0032_0FBF58DF32FAE358">in a cell upon bread and water, mourning out my days for having grieved my Lord. I went into my room and &s;at in one po&s;iti|on till nine o'clock. I then threw my&s;elf on the bed, and &s;lept till morning. Al|though it was the Lord's-day, I did not intend to go to any place of wor&s;hip; nei|ther did I de&s;ire to &s;ee any per&s;on, but wi&s;hed to pa&s;s my time away in total &s;oli|tude. I continued reading the Bible till eight, and then under a &s;en&s;e of duty, called the family together for prayer. As I &s;tood with a book in my hand, in the act of giving out a hymn, this thought powerfully &s;truck my mind, "It is not right for you to keep your fellow-creatures in bondage; you mu&s;t let the oppre&s;&s;ed go free." I knew it to be that &s;ame ble&s;&s;ed voice which had &s;poken to me before&mdash;till then I had never &s;u&s;pected that the prac|tice of &s;lave-keeping was wrong; I had not read a book on the &s;ubject, nor been told &s;o by any&mdash;I pau&s;ed a minute and then replied, "Lord, the oppre&s;&s;ed &s;hall go free." And I was as clear of them in my mind, as if I had never owned one. I told them they did not belong to me, and that I did not de&s;ire their &s;ervices without
<PB N="34" REF="023401_0033_0FBF58E239FA25D8">making them a compen&s;ation; and I was now at liberty to proceed in wor&s;hip. After &s;inging, I kneeled to pray. Had I the tongue of an angel, I could not fully de&s;cribe what I felt: all my dejection and that melancholy gloom which preyed upon me, vani&s;hed in a moment: a divine &s;weetne&s;s ran through my whole frame&mdash;O! in what a wonderful manner was my poor &s;oul let into the depths of my Redeemer's loved Prai&s;e and glory to his name for ever!</P>
<P>I had now no de&s;ire to confine my&s;elf to a cell, but wi&s;hed to &s;pread my Redeemer's glory to the ends of the world. I ble&s;s the Lord for leading me &s;afe through &s;uch fie|ry trials! My late affliction of mind was for my good. It was God, not man, that taught me the impropriety of holding &s;laves: and I &s;hall never be able to prai&s;e him enough for it. My very heart has bled, &s;ince that, for &s;lave-holders, e&s;peci|ally tho&s;e who make a profe&s;&s;ion of religi|on; for I believe it to be a crying &s;in. In the forenoon I attended church, but I could not find what I wanted. In the af|ternoon I went to hear the Methodi&s;ts; and &s;omething told me, "the&s;e are the peo|ple." I was &s;o happy in the time of
<PB N="35" REF="023401_0034_0FBF58EA192178C0">preaching, that I could conceal it no lon|ger; &s;o I determined to chu&s;e God's peo|ple for my people, and returned home re|joicing.</P>
<P>A few days after, I attended a cla&s;s-meeting on Deer-creek, for the fir&s;t time, and was convinced it was a prudential in|&s;titution; and my heart was more than ever united to this community. I told Br. H. a pious man, what the Lord had done for me. I now began again to be pre&s;&s;ed in &s;pirit to vi&s;it my friends and neighbours; and e&s;pecially &s;ome particular families which lay with weight on my mind. The fir&s;t vi&s;it I made, the man of the hou&s;e was much enraged again&s;t me; but my dear Lord gave me one or two of his children. Shortly after I vi&s;ited another family; and the ma&s;ter was brought to cry for mercy, on his knees before the Lord. The third was near twenty miles off: I &s;eemed to go with confidence, and got there a little be|fore night: I told him what God had done for me, and de&s;ired he would &s;end out and call in the neighbours, and I would pray with and for them. The per&s;on did &s;o, and after prayer I was obliged, for the fir&s;t time, to open my mouth by way of ex|hortation;
<PB N="36" REF="023401_0035_0FBF58EB3438A700">and the Lord filled it, and &s;ent his arrows to the hearts of three &s;inners, one of whom &s;lept very little that night; and another followed me near &s;ixteen miles the next day.</P>
<P>I again attended cla&s;s for the &s;econd time at Mr. D.'s; and as they had not heard what had happened to me, &s;ome of them were fearful that I had come in to &s;py out their liberties. I aro&s;e from my &s;eat, and, for the fir&s;t time among the Methodi&s;ts, publicly declared what the Lord had done <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> me. A divine kindling ran through the whole hou&s;e; and we had a ble&s;&s;ed meeting. The leader offered to give up his paper to me; but I refu&s;ed, &s;aying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> would vi&s;it them as often as I could; and &s;o returned home, prai&s;ing God.</P>
<P>I felt an impre&s;&s;ion to go to that brother I have before mentioned, who was rai&s;ed from the jaws of death: he was in a &s;eek|ing way; but did not profe&s;s the faith of a&s;&s;urance. I begged of him to call a meet|ing in his own hou&s;e, and I found grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> freedom to &s;peak, and appointed anoth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> meeting; about forty people gathered; an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> whil&s;t I was &s;peaking, the power of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Lord came down in a wonderful manner
<PB N="37" REF="023401_0036_0FBF58ECF0B70608">near half the poor &s;inners that were pre&s;ent, were &s;truck to the floor, and cried for mercy to &s;uch a degree, that they were heard at a great di&s;tance. After the meeting was ever, many continued crying for mercy.</P>
<P>The next morning a gentleman who liv|ed not far off, came to the hou&s;e to beat me: &s;oon after he entered he began to &s;wear, affirming I would &s;poil all his ne|groes. I told him if he did not leave off &s;wearing, he would &s;end his &s;oul to hell. He replied, "If I &s;aid that again, he would level me to the floor." I a&s;&s;ured him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> would reprove him whenever he took <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Lord's name in vain. He then ro&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and &s;truck me on the &s;ide of the face, and followed his blows. There were five of us in the hou&s;e, my brother, his over&s;eer, my&s;elf, and two enemies. I was afraid we &s;hould have had a general battle. My brother was only awakened; his over&s;eer had no religion beyond a zeal for the truth, and &s;uch a love for my brother and my&s;elf, that he would almo&s;t have laid down his life for us. My mind was perfectly calm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and my &s;oul &s;o happy, that I &s;carce felt his blows. I &s;aw the Lord's hand in my pre&s;ervation; for though he was in &s;o vio|lent
<PB N="38" REF="023401_0037_0FBF58EF36B9DB70">a rage, I had not been exhorting ma|ny minutes (with tears) before he was as quiet as a lamb: and he and his man, bid|ding us good morning, went away. Dear man! not long after he was taken into as awful eternity.</P>
<P>I now began to hold evening meetings in different places, &s;everal times in a week: and united tho&s;e who were awakened into a kind of &s;ociety; and &s;everal, I tru&s;t, were happily united to Je&s;us.

Frequently we have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tinued &s;inging, praying, and prai&s;ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> till after midnight.

<P>I was determined I would have nothing to do with the unhappy war; it was con|trary to my mind, and grievous to my con|&s;cience, to have any hand in &s;hedding hu|man blood. On this account I was taken, at the general meeting, before the rulers. But my dear Lord was with me, and gave me words that my oppo&s;ers could not re|&s;i&s;t. While &s;urrounded by my enemies, my &s;oul was happy, and, with tears flow|ing from my eyes, I told them their d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ger, and entreated them to turn to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Lord: they laid a fine upon me, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Lord would not permit them to take a far|thing of my property.

<P>It was pre&s;&s;ed on my mind to have &s;ome conver&s;ation with Mr. W&mdash;. He had been the means of keeping me from God and his people for a long time. We had a long di&s;cour&s;e in the ve&s;try chamber, before the ve&s;try: where I told him what God had done for me. He de&s;ired to know who gave me authority to hold meetings in his
<PB N="40" REF="023401_0039_0FBF58F887498E08">pari&s;h? I told him I did not do it either for money or honor; that while there were &s;inners in his pari&s;h, and the Lord pre&s;&s;ed it on my mind, I &s;hould call them to re|pentance. "You have no right to do it," &s;aid he, "unle&s;s you were ordained." The love of God con&s;traineth me, &s;aid I, and I mu&s;t open my mouth in his cau&s;e. Hav|ing ta&s;ted his goodne&s;s, I have a longing de&s;ire that my neighbours &s;hould be made happy too. After a conver&s;ation of near two hours on the new birth, finding his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ind di&s;turbed, I told him in a plain man|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> what I thought of his doctrine, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> effect it formerly had on me, and &s;o our meeting ended. After I withdrew to my home, being young in the way, very few to &s;trengthen and many to weaken my hands, I was &s;orely tempted of Satan to give up my confidence in my dear Lord. And under heavy affliction of mind I with|drew, and wre&s;tled in prayer till the Lord vi&s;ited me, and di&s;per&s;ed every doubt and every fear; giving me the&s;e words for my comfort, "Fear not, I am with you, and will &s;upport you under all your trials." O what con&s;olatory &s;treams flowed into my
<PB N="41" REF="023401_0040_0FBF58F9E02FAB78">heart! and how was I &s;trengthened and enabled to rejoice in the Lord!</P>
<P>Mr. T. R. under&s;tanding that my mind was exerci&s;ed re&s;pecting the mini&s;try, &s;ent to me to meet him at Mr. D&mdash;'s; I did &s;o, and although he was a &s;tranger to me, I found in him a father, who gave me mo&s;t &s;alutary advice, which I &s;tood much in need of: for I had been wading through deep waters, and under very &s;evere exer|ci&s;es. I left him, much &s;trengthened and encouraged to go on in the ble&s;&s;ed work. Some time after my brother reque&s;ted to have preaching at his hou&s;e, and it was there I became acquainted with Mr. R&mdash;a, who applied to me to travel with him. I complied, and found my&s;elf very happy; and at times had freedom to &s;peak, though the cro&s;s was very heavy; and I was often ready to &s;tart back. I had not been with him long before I returned home, and was &s;o powerfully exerci&s;ed, that I concluded it would not do to become a travelling preacher. Here my enemy &s;tepped in, and told me there was one way to prevent it, which was to alter my condition. The object was &s;oon determined on, and I made her a vi&s;it, told my errand, and &s;et a time
<PB N="42" REF="023401_0041_0FBF58FAF9C0A718">when I &s;hould expect to have her an&s;wer. Many plea&s;ing pro&s;pects now opened upon me; all this time I was willing to do any thing about home to promote the cau&s;e of religion: but it was like death to me to travel. The time arrived, and I went to know the per&s;on's mind re&s;pecting my late propo&s;al; but behold! the hand of the Lord was again&s;t it: during the night it was as if &s;ome per&s;on was telling me, "You are about to do your own will; I have a greater work for you; you mu&s;t go out and preach the go&s;pel." My mind was &s;o di&s;quieted, I &s;carcely clo&s;ed my eyes throughout the night; till being fully con|vinced I was entering on a work the Lord had not called me to, I determined to give the matter up. In the morning early, I met the per&s;on in the hall; I told her my difficulty; and that I believed the Lord had a greater work for me to do. I have written on this &s;ubject for the benefit of young preachers, into who&s;e hands this may fall: being per&s;uaded the enemy of &s;ouls exerci&s;es many of them in the &s;ame way. O that they may be wi&s;e and break the &s;nare of the devil! Mr. R&mdash;a de&s;ired me to meet him in Baltimore town at a
<PB N="43" REF="023401_0042_0FBF58FC99ECC7A0">certain time: I went, and he forced me into the pulpit, but the cro&s;s was &s;o heavy, and my temptations &s;o great, I could &s;carcely &s;upport under them; but, ble&s;&s;ed be God, after I opened my mouth, I felt my dear Saviour, and it was a &s;weet time to me, and I expect to many more. I tra|velled a few days with him, after which he &s;ent me on a circuit alone. This was the fall after my conver&s;ion. I found great liberty of &s;peech, and the word was ble&s;&s;ed to many &s;ouls, for the Lord greatly a&s;&s;i&s;ted me, and I had &s;weet, refre&s;hing &s;ea&s;ons. Oh! how happy might I have been, had I guarded again&s;t my powerful adver&s;ary! I had not been on the circuit more than fifteen days, before I gave way to the de|vil's &s;ugge&s;tions, and concluded I was not called to this work. I left the circuit un|der deep dejection, and returned home; determined I would never attempt it again. The devil told me, the more I went among the Methodi&s;ts, particularly the preachers, the more my mind would be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed about travelling. I was &s;till willing to &s;peak <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ca&s;ionally about home; but to go through the world, I knew not where, was a bur|den too heavy for me to bear.</P>
<PB N="44" REF="023401_0043_0FBF5903D6FC1FF0">
<P>It is not in my power to give a full ac|count of all my exerci&s;es from the fall till the following &s;pring. It may however be nece&s;&s;ary to touch on a few particulars; for about four months I &s;pent my time in prayer, reading, and &s;uch like exerci&s;es, except when I was from home, at preach|ing, or holding meetings my&s;elf. The idea of travelling and preaching the go&s;pel was con&s;tantly held up to my view. Frequent|ly, when riding or walking, I was drawn out on divine &s;ubjects, and at times the Bible &s;eemed all open to me: it was not uncommon for me to preach in my &s;leep. One night the whole world of &s;inners &s;eem|ed to be exhibited as it were in the air, &s;u&s;pended by a &s;lender thread, and the di&s;|mal pit beneath them. I &s;aw them care|le&s;s and unconcerned, in all kinds of un|godly practices, as &s;ecure as if in no &s;ort of danger: in my &s;leep I began to cry aloud to convince them of their danger; till I awakened my brother, who the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> awoke me: I was &s;itting up in my bed, trembling and as wet with &s;weat as if I had been dipped in a river.

I have frequently &s;tood a&s;toni&s;hed, wept and mourned in &s;ecret before the Lord, and entreated him to &s;end &s;ome one el&s;e that was more &s;en&s;ible and capable than my&s;elf: looking around in my mind, and nominating &s;uch and &s;uch per&s;ons, whom I conceived to be more fit for the office of the mini&s;try; &s;aying, how can it be, that &s;uch an unworthy, ignorant being &s;hould be &s;et apart for &s;o great a work? When on my way to my occa&s;ional ap|pointments, I would promi&s;e in my mind, that if the Lord attended his word with great power, I would con&s;ent to give up, and labor for him. And at &s;uch times I have had great di&s;plays of the goodne&s;s of God, and &s;inners weeping all around; and although my mind at the pre&s;ent would be re&s;olved, unbelief would again a&s;&s;ault and overpower me.</P>
<P>In the month of March my conflicts were &s;o great, I almo&s;t &s;unk under them. The ungodly among&s;t my acquaintances knew not what was the matter with me: &s;ome would a&s;k if I was &s;ick (for I was much worn away.) Others would &s;ay behind my back, he will come to nothing. I believe
<PB N="46" REF="023401_0045_0FBF590633346DD0">I had a more &s;evere travail of &s;oul before I &s;ubmitted to be a travelling preacher, than I had gone through for ju&s;tifying grace. One day being almo&s;t weary of life, and under deep dejection, I thought if the Lord would manife&s;t his will, I would, through grace, obey. I was next led to enquire how I was to expect this de&s;ired favor. I kneeled down by the bed and prayed to the Lord, by &s;ome means or other, to make a di&s;covery to me, in the cleare&s;t manner, of what he would have me to do. I aro&s;e from my knees without any particular an&s;wer, much burdened and greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. I threw my&s;elf on the bed again, and in le&s;s than two minutes I was in a &s;ound &s;leep. I dreamed I &s;aw the devil come in at the door, and advance towards me; I thought a good angel came and &s;pake to me, &s;aying "Will you go and preach the go&s;pel?" I re|plied, "I am unworthy, I cannot go:" In|&s;tantly the devil laid hold of my hand, and I began to &s;truggle to get from him; I &s;aw but one way that I could e&s;cape, and that was a very narrow one. The good angel &s;aid to me, "There <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel committed to you, and wo unto you, if you preach not the go&s;pel." I
<PB N="47" REF="023401_0046_0FBF5907D60CDDF0">&s;truggled for &s;ome time to get from him, but in vain, at length I cried out, "Lord, &s;end by whom thou wilt, I am willing to go and preach thy go&s;pel." No &s;ooner had I thus &s;ubmitted, than I &s;aw the devil fly as it were through the end of the hou&s;e in a flame of fire. I awoke, immediately every cloud was di&s;per&s;ed, and my &s;oul was enraptured with the love of my dear Sa|viour. I wanted now to conver&s;e with &s;ome experienced per&s;on on the &s;ubject, my way now appeared &s;o open, I thought I &s;hould never have any more doubts to contend with. I believe it was the next day, I received a letter from brother D. R. de&s;iring me to come and take the circuit a &s;ew weeks while he went to Philadelphia. I had no doubt, but the Lord directed him to write thus. Before the day arrived that I was to &s;et off, the enemy &s;trove again to prevent me; telling me, I was deluded, that it was only my own fancy, or the vanity of my own heart. After I &s;et out I was per&s;ecuted to that degree, I was ready to de&s;ire my hor&s;e might throw me and put an end to my life; or maim me &s;o that I might not be able to go on. In the even|ing I got to brother D. R.'s, in Cecil,
<PB N="48" REF="023401_0047_0FBF591024D346D0">where he had an appointment for me, but my exerci&s;es were &s;o &s;evere, that I could &s;ay but little. The next day he left me, and I concluded to go on the circuit. Of all creatures in the world, I have the grat|e&s;t rea&s;on to be thankful to the Lord, for his tender care of me, a poor, weak rebel again&s;t him. At the fir&s;t and &s;econd places to which I went, the Lord was powerfully pre&s;ent; and I believe good was done. I was now quite willing to be an exhorter; but thought I would not take a text: How|ever I had not travelled far before I had a text &s;ugge&s;ted to me, and I refu&s;ed, till my gift of exhortation was almo&s;t taken away; and my mind was amazingly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed again.</P>
<P>One Sabbath I came to a place near Chop|tank bridge, where I again refu&s;ed to give out a text, and it plea&s;ed the Lord to hide his face, &s;o that I was unable to &s;peak with any degree of freedom. I went to my afternoon's appointment very low both in mind and body; having taken very lit|tle refre&s;hment for &s;everal days. I deter|mined if a text opened to me, I would give it out boldly, and tru&s;t in the Lord. It was &s;o, and I gave out "Behold the man." I
<PB N="49" REF="023401_0048_0FBF5911717CAF98">&s;hall never forget the afternoon; it was a time of power to me and many others; the whole Bible &s;eemed open to me. The next day I went to my appointment, with &s;ome willingne&s;s to be a preacher. I gave out this text, "The great day of his wrath is come, and who &s;hall be able to &s;tand." I endeavoured to &s;hew, as I could, how aw|ful that day would be; and who would, and who would not, be enabled to &s;tand; with the dreadful con&s;equence. The pow|er of God in a very remarkable manner came down among the people, and hard|ened &s;inners were brought to cry for mer|cy. When almo&s;t &s;pent, I &s;topt; but the people continued praying; O! it was a memorable &s;ea&s;on! my &s;oul was happy, and my heart humbled. I was now willing to be a preacher, and thought &s;urely I &s;hall never doubt again.</P>
<P>When brother D. R. returned, he took the circuit, and I went out to open a new one. As I pa&s;&s;ed along through Tuckey|hoe Neck, I called at a hou&s;e and a&s;ked the woman, if &s;he wanted to hear the word of the Lord preached, if the did, to &s;end and call in her neighbours; &s;he did &s;o, and I found great freedom. I gave out, that I
<PB N="50" REF="023401_0049_0FBF591301EC7E20">would preach again the next day. The man of the hou&s;e was an officer of rank, and it being a day of general mu&s;tering, he marched up all the company, and I &s;pake to hundreds with freedom; many tears were &s;hed, and &s;everal convicted, one of whom has &s;ince become a preacher. I continued &s;everal days in the Neck, and my labors were attended with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>I again met brother D. R. in Cecil county, where we had a quarterly-meeting, and from thence we &s;et out for Hartford. He &s;olicited me not to fail attending the Baltimore conference. On the Lord's-day following, an appointment was made for me to preach in my native place; and a multitude gathered: among&s;t whom many of my old friends and relations were there, which made the cro&s;s very heavy. I gave out my old text, "The great day of his wrath is come, and who &s;hall be able to &s;tand." Ju&s;t as I had entered on the &s;ub|ject, I fainted under the cro&s;s, and fell to the ground (I was preaching under the trees) where I laid till water was brought and thrown on me, when I immediately recovered, and was enabled to ri&s;e. I then proc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eded, the &s;ubject opened to me, and
<PB N="51" REF="023401_0050_0FBF591484BC4F90">we had a &s;olemn &s;ea&s;on. On Monday I had a &s;evere conflict about attending the conference. The exerci&s;e of my mind was too great for my emaciated frame. I be|took my&s;elf to my bed and lay till twelve o'clock, and then ro&s;e up, and &s;et off. I got into Baltimore about &s;un-&s;et. The confer|ence was to begin the next day: I attended, pa&s;&s;ed through an examination, and was admitted on trial: and my name was, for the fir&s;t time, cla&s;&s;ed among the Methodi&s;ts; and I received of Mr. T. R. a written li|cen&s;e. My mind continued &s;o agitated (for I &s;till felt an unwillingne&s;s to be a travel|ling preacher) that after I went from the preaching-hou&s;e to dinner, I again fainted under my burden, and &s;unk to the floor. When I recovered, I found my&s;elf in an upper chamber on the bed, &s;urrounded by &s;everal preachers; I a&s;ked, "where I had been," and &s;eemed to be lo&s;t to all things below, appearing to have been in a place from whence I did not de&s;ire to return: the brethren joined in prayer, my &s;oul was &s;o happy, and every thing wore &s;o plea&s;|ing an a&s;pect, that the preachers appeared more like angels to me than men. And I have ble&s;&s;ed my dear Lord ever &s;ince, that

<HEAD>SECTION III. <HI>A &s;hort Account of my fir&s;t Year's Travels in Maryland and Virginia.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I WAS appointed to travel in the Fre|deric circuit with Mr. R. and as the conference ended on Friday, I &s;et out and got as far as Mr. W&mdash;n's, and the next day got into my circuit. I preached on the Lord's-day with very little freedom, or hap|pine&s;s to my own &s;oul: the enemy &s;till pur&s;ued me, throwing in his fiery darts. At times. I had &s;weet communion with my dear Lord; but a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of my weak|ne&s;s and inability for the great work in which I had engaged, cau&s;ed my hands <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> hang down. I was a young &s;oldier, and knew but little about exerci&s;ing the Chri&s;|tian armour. The goodne&s;s of God was great to me, in opening the hearts of the
<PB N="53" REF="023401_0052_0FBF591CB50BB258">people to receive and bear with my weak|ne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>One day on my way to my appointment, the difficulties appeared &s;o great, that I turned my hor&s;e, three different times, homeward. I was in a &s;olitary wood, en|tirely alone; I wept, and mourned, and prayed at the feet of my Lord, and was en|couraged to go forward: I did, and a &s;weet and powerful meeting we had. Sometimes when I have been at the appointed place, and the people a&s;&s;embling, I have been tempted to hide my&s;elf, or wi&s;h that I was &s;ick; at other times I have envied the hap|pine&s;s of crawling in&s;ects on the face of the earth; and I have con&s;tantly found, that the greater cro&s;s it was to &s;peak for God, the greater was the ble&s;&s;ing, both to my&s;elf and the people. In &s;imilar ca&s;es, I &s;eldom open<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d my mouth to &s;peak in public, but what the power of the Lord was &s;en&s;ibly felt. My Bible, at particular times, would appear &s;o &s;mall that I could not find a text. I remember one day, a congregation was gathered, and I was alone, under deep ex|erci&s;e; and it appeared as if there was not one ver&s;e in the Bible that I could &s;peak up|on: but all on a &s;udden, whil&s;t I was on
<PB N="54" REF="023401_0053_0FBF591E531986C0">my knees before the Lord, the following text was powerfully applied: <HI>The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, becau&s;e he hath anointed me to preach glad tidings to the meek, to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the pri&s;on to them that are bound.</HI> I&s;aiah lxi. 1. I immediately met the a&s;&s;embly, and af|ter &s;inging and prayer, gave out the text, and the power of God de&s;cended in an ex|traordinary manner. Before this, the peo|ple were &s;o hardened, that we had no more than four members; but before I left the hou&s;e, twenty, who &s;eemed to be that day broken in heart, were added to the &s;ociety: and we continued &s;inging and praying till near &s;un&s;et, and there appeared to be very &s;ew in the congregation who&s;e hearts were not touched; my voice being almo&s;t lo&s;t in the cries of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. O! ble&s;&s;ed be God! this was a day of marrow and fat things to my poor heart.</P>
<P>Some time after I was reque&s;ted to ap|point a watch-night, and I con&s;ented. Mr. R. was di&s;plea&s;ed that I had not con&s;ulted him; but I was innocent, knowing very little of the di&s;cipline. Many people came together, and many of the children of the
<PB N="55" REF="023401_0054_0FBF5927FA2573C8">devil were angry and &s;toned the hou&s;e; but our dear Lord was powerfully pre&s;ent. God's people had a little paradi&s;e; and I tru&s;t there were &s;everal new-born &s;ouls, and &s;ome poor &s;inners brought to tremble. I can truly &s;ay it was a great time with me.</P>
<P>I continued &s;ix months in this circuit: and ble&s;&s;ed be God! many were added to the &s;ociety; his children much quickened; and many happily brought into the kingdom of grace. My heart was clo&s;ely united to the people, and they were remarkably kind to me, all around the circuit. I thought it a great favor to be received as a preacher: and I verily believe the Lord inclined the hearts of the people to overlook my many weakne&s;&s;es and want of knowledge; and, for the &s;ake of his dear Son, he in a &s;mall mea&s;ure owned my efforts. To his honor be it &s;poken.</P>
<P>I think it was in November I was &s;ent to Fairfax circuit, where I &s;taid three months. I had many happy moments, and preached the go&s;pel with freedom. I cannot &s;ay I met with much &s;ucce&s;s, neither was I &s;o powerfully hara&s;&s;ed by the devil. I was now better acquainted with his devices; and, I tru&s;t, had a more &s;teady confidence in my
<PB N="56" REF="023401_0055_0FBF592979897630">dear Saviour. I began to preach the word more freely, and was not &s;o ea&s;ily &s;haken with re&s;pect to my call to the mini|&s;try: and I was now entirely willing to be a travelling preacher: and ble&s;&s;ed be God! he gave me favor in the &s;ight of the peo|ple.</P>
<P>As there were many doors open for us in New Virginia, and &s;everal &s;mall &s;ocieties formed, Mr. R. thought it expedient to &s;end me into tho&s;e parts of the country; and ble&s;&s;ed be my God! I found a willing|ne&s;s to go any where, and to do any thing that would bring mo&s;t honor and &s;ervice to the church of God. I ble&s;s and prai&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Lord for his goodne&s;s to me during my &s;tay in that part of his vineyard, for he wonderfully enlarged my de&s;ires after him; and increa&s;ed my gifts, and opened the hearts and hou&s;es of the people to receive his &s;ervant and his wood. And many were added to the &s;ociety.</P>
<P>I vi&s;ited Shepherd's town, lying high up on the Patowmac river. On the Lord's-day I attended the church, and heard their mini&s;ter preach on <HI>Keep holy the Sabbath-day.</HI> He was a &s;low-&s;poken man, and I think his di&s;cour&s;e took up fifteen minutes.

<P>My appointment was in Virginia, in what was called Brun&s;wick circuit, with brother W. and brother T. After &s;pend|ing a few days among my relations and old friends, on Monday I &s;et out for my circuit, and on Tue&s;day met the preachers at brother M&mdash;r's in Fairfax: and the next morning we &s;et out in company on our way. My appointment was much to my mind, and I had a lively hope that my dear Lord would be with me, and ble&s;s my weak endeavours to promote his cau&s;e.</P>
<P>We travelled &s;everal days before we met any Methodi&s;ts; but my dear Lord be|friended us, for we had happy times toge|ther; and had an opportunity of preaching &s;everal &s;ermons before we reached our cir|cuit: we had a &s;weet &s;ea&s;on at the hou&s;e of a good old man; and I think we were providentially &s;ent thither, not only for the benefit of the family, but likewi&s;e of ma|ny others.</P>
<P>June the 4th I parted with my compa|ny, and thanks be to God, my &s;oul was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">&s;hed as w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">h new wine. The &s;ame
<PB N="63" REF="023401_0062_0FBF5939F1373E40">day I was brought to the hou&s;e of a kind widow, who &s;ent out and called a compa|ny together. There was a young, growing &s;ociety in this neighbourhood. I preached from <HI>Fear not, little flock,</HI> &amp;c. Luke xii. 32. From what I could under&s;tand they had &s;eldom had &s;uch a time of refre&s;hing. I could &s;ay it is good for me to be here. My confidence &s;till grew &s;tronger with re|&s;pect to my call to the mini&s;try.</P>
<P>On the fifth of June I got into my cir|cuit, and on Saturday the 7th, began my mini&s;try among a lively people. I was at|tacked by an officer who wanted to know my mind re&s;pecting fighting. I told him God had taught me better than to u&s;e car|nal weapons again&s;t the lives of human creatures. He intimated &s;omething about &s;topping me. I told him I was not afraid of man&mdash;that if he did not learn to fight with other weapons he would go to hell.</P>
<P>On Sunday the eighth of June, I preach|ed at brother I&mdash;'s to many &s;erious peo|ple. While I was pointing out the go&s;pel-&s;alvation, there was a &s;hout in the camp of I&s;rael; and after the meeting ended there was a rejoicing among the people. I met the &s;ociety, and was more than ever con|firmed
<PB N="64" REF="023401_0063_0FBF5942433ABC88">in my belief, that the Lord had &s;ent me into that part of his vineyard. I there met with a black boy that was happy in the Lord; and I thought he exceeded all the youths that ever I &s;aw for a gift and power in prayer.</P>
<P>Monday June the 9th, I preached a few miles off, from tho&s;e words, <HI>Loo&s;e him and let him go.</HI> There were as many people as the hou&s;e could contain. And after preach|ing near two hours, the cries of the a&s;&s;em|bly were &s;o great that I gave over. The people continued together a long time after, and I doubt not but &s;everal were &s;et at li|berty. O Je&s;us! thou &s;till increa&s;e&s;t my faith; thou give&s;t me lively &s;en&s;ations of thy pardoning love; and that thou ha&s;t called me to the mini&s;try of thy ble&s;&s;ed word. At this meeting we were &s;o won|derfully drawn out that we knew not when to part, having &s;eldom felt the like. The next day I had great freedom to preach, and one &s;oul was born of God.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day June 12, I found much ea&s;e in preaching at Dr. C&mdash;r's to an attentive, &s;olemn congregation; but not very lively. I rode to Col. T&mdash;r's, and met brother E. P. We held a watch-night, and I
<PB N="65" REF="023401_0064_0FBF5943B1E694F8">think I never had more freedom to &s;peak. The word was ble&s;&s;ed to the colonel and his family, and they treate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> me ever after more like a &s;on than a &s;tranger; yea, I I may &s;ay, more like an angel than a poor clod of earth. And I, on my part, &s;hall ever re&s;pect them for their kindne&s;s to me.</P>
<P>The next day I again cro&s;&s;ed the Roan|oak river, and had great liberty to preach from the&s;e words, <HI>For lo, the winter is pa&s;t, the rain is over and gone, the flowers appear on the earth, the time of the &s;inging of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in the land, &amp;c.</HI> After this, we had a love-fea&s;t, and many &s;pake freely of the goodne&s;s of God. In this place the peo|ple wanted to gain me with their kindne&s;s; but I refu&s;ed their obliging offers, being convinced I &s;hould do more good in wan|dering up and down the earth without any incumbrances; and as for riches, I had enough to &s;erve my purpo&s;es. The temp|tation was con&s;iderable, and plea&s;ing to nature. Vain world, away with your flat|tery! I could rejoice in my God, with the te&s;timony of a good con&s;cience, know|ing that the oblation was made for the
<PB N="66" REF="023401_0065_0FBF59456EBB0340">good of Chri&s;t's church, which he purcha|&s;ed with his own blood. It was no time to think of hou&s;es and land, &amp;c. I pa&s;&s;ed on, rejoicing in God my Saviour, and was greatly encouraged in the ble&s;&s;ed work. But halcyon days did not always attend me. For again I experienced the &s;evere buffetings of Satan; but my exerci&s;es proved a ble&s;&s;ing to me, for my &s;oul was humbled, and I was made in a mea&s;ure &s;en&s;ible of the need of a deeper work of grace on my heart, before I could be com|pletely happy.</P>
<P>Sunday June 22d, in Roanoak chapel I preached to about five hundred whites, and almo&s;t as many blacks who &s;tood without; I found freedom of mind, and tears trick|led down the faces of many, both white and black. And the next day while I was preaching a funeral &s;ermon, we had much of the divine pre&s;ence. In this way I con|tinued around the circuit, till the quarterly meeting, which was held in Augu&s;t, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Maberry's chap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l.

I believed there was &s;uch a thing as perfect love to be attained in this world; and I likewi&s;e knew I was not in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it: I &s;aw a beauty in the doctrine, and preached it, but it was at a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>About this time the &s;tate-oath began to be admini&s;tered, and was univer&s;ally com|plied with, both by preachers and people where I was; but I could by no means be &s;ubject to my rulers in this re&s;pect, as it touched my con&s;cience towards God: &s;o I was informed I mu&s;t either leave the &s;tate, take the oath, or go to gaol. I told tho&s;e who came to tender the oath to me, that I profe&s;&s;ed my&s;elf a friend to my country: that I would do nothing willingly or know|ingly to the prejudice of it: that if they required it, I would give them good &s;ecu|rity of my friendly behaviour during my &s;tay in the &s;tate. "But why," &s;aid they, "will you not take the oath?" "I think," &s;aid I, "the oath is too binding on my con&s;cience; moreover, I never &s;wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> an oath in my life: and mini&s;ters of the go&s;|pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> have enough to do in their &s;phere.

<P>Many of my friends endeavoured to per&s;uade me to comply; alleging, that I might be more u&s;eful among the people: but it was to no purpo&s;e. The rulers &s;aid, "You mu&s;t leave the &s;tate." This I can|not do; for, fir&s;t, the conference appoint|ed me to labor in this &s;tate: and in the &s;econd place, I am confident that my ap|pointment is approved of by my heavenly Father; and therefore, I dare not leave the &s;tate. "Then," &s;aid they, "you mu&s;t away to pri&s;on." That matter, I replied, I leave to the God of Daniel; a&s;&s;ured he is able to defend my cau&s;e; whether in or out of gaol.</P>
<P>The many trials I had on this occa&s;ion drove me nearer to God, and as many thought that every &s;ermon would be my la&s;t, many more attended than otherwi&s;e would; and I found much freedom to preach the word; and good was done: I al&s;o found a great degree of &s;weetne&s;s in my dear Saviour, for great was his good|ne&s;s to me.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="023401_0068_0FBF59508B2A6218">
At a certain place &s;everal of the rulers bound them&s;elves to put me to gaol, when I came that way again: my friends per&s;uad|ed me to decline going <HI>there;</HI> but I told them I could not be clear if I di&s;tru&s;ted &s;o good a God. Before I came round to that place, the Lord laid his afflicting hand on &s;ome of tho&s;e ruling men who had threat|ened to impri&s;on me; &s;o that when I went there, &s;everal of them had already made their exit off the &s;tage of human action: and another was lying at the point of death.

In this circuit I met with a number of inward and outward trials; but I ble&s;s God, that ever he &s;ent me into this part of his vineyard: for I can truly &s;ay, that the life and conver&s;ation of many of my worthy friends (&s;ome of whom were older in the grace of God than my&s;elf) were made a great ble&s;&s;ing to me.

In September I went to North-Carolina, to travel Roanoak circuit, and was &s;weetly drawn out in the glorious work, though my exerci&s;es were very great, particularly re|&s;pecting the &s;lavery and hard u&s;age of the poor afflicted negroes. Many times did my heart ache on their account, and many tears ran down my cheeks, both in Virginia and Carolina, while exhibiting a crucified Je&s;us to their view; and I ble&s;s God that my la|bors were not in vain among them. I en|deavoured frequently to inculcate the doc|trine of freedom in a private way, and this procured me the ill will of &s;ome, who were in that unmerciful practice.

<P>One day, I went to my appointment, and whil&s;t the people were gathering, I withdrew about a quarter of a mile from the hou&s;e, and wre&s;tled with the Lord in prayer; and thought I could not meet the congregation, unle&s;s I was delivered from my inbred chains.

<P>From this time I began to preach the doctrine of Chri&s;tian perfection more than ever; the plan &s;eemed as clear to me as the noon-day &s;un. And many were con|vinced of the need of it; and &s;ome were brought into the perfect liberty of God's children.

Glory to God! I can &s;ay I had many ble&s;&s;ed, happy moments while tra|ver&s;ing

<P>I have often thought, that the con&s;ola|tions afforded me were an ample compen|&s;ation for all the difficulties and trials I met with in wandering up and down through an ill-natured world. And I often reflect and bewail my backwardne&s;s, when I fir&s;t entered &s;o unwillingly as a laborer into my Lord's vineyard. But now, thanks to his dear name, I go willingly; and de&s;ire cheer|fully to obey all his commandments, and do all the little good I can to promote his honor and glory.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION V. <HI>My fir&s;t regular Travels through the Penin|&s;ula, including the Delaware and Part of Maryland.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE had a comfortable conference in Lee&s;burgh, and May 20, 1778, I &s;et out for my de&s;tined place. After preach|ing a few &s;ermons, and vi&s;iting my old friends and relations, on the 30th of May I cro&s;&s;ed the Che&s;apeak; and in the even|ing had a delightful opportunity of pre&s;&s;ing the nece&s;&s;ity of holine&s;s on the minds of many. Ble&s;&s;ed be God! there was a &s;hout in the camp among our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour's de&s;pi&s;ed followers. And I have no doubt but that my Lord directed my lot into this part of the work.</P>
<P>On Sunday I &s;poke in Kent preaching|hou&s;e with much liberty; and we had a &s;weet, refre&s;hing &s;ea&s;on. This was the fir&s;t Methodi&s;t preaching-hou&s;e that was built on this &s;hore. In the evening I was much drawn out in prayer and &s;elf-exami|nation; and felt the &s;weet beams of the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, and experienced the bli&s;s of prayer, with a comfortable hope that my
<PB N="77" REF="023401_0076_0FBF596B001CA020">dear Lord had deepened his work of grace in my heart. Four preachers were ap|pointed by conference for the Penin&s;ula&mdash; Brothers H. L. C and my&s;elf. The ene|my of &s;ouls had &s;tirred up a great per&s;ecu|tion again&s;t the Methodi&s;ts. Brother H. was taken by the rulers, and put in confine|ment. Brother L. thought it his duty to re|turn to Virginia. And poor brother C. was too unwell to travel much: &s;o that for a con&s;iderable time I was left almo&s;t alone.</P>
<P>To human appearance our pro&s;pects were gloomy. In this place what was called a tory company embodied them&s;elves, and a back&s;liding Methodi&s;t was at the head of them. It was &s;oon circulated through the country that the Methodi&s;ts were enemies to the American cau&s;e: and were embody|ing them&s;elves to meet the Engli&s;h army. A &s;hort time before this, the Engli&s;h preachers had embarked for Europe; and the conduct of Mr. R. had been very inju|rious to the per&s;ecuted flock: &s;o that the cloud which aro&s;e in the Ea&s;t, grew very dark. During this time, dear Mr. F. A. found an a&s;ylum at the hou&s;e of good old judge W. and I believe none but the Lord and him&s;elf knew what he &s;uf|fered
<PB N="78" REF="023401_0077_0FBF5971A32CAF38">for near twelve months. And we have &s;ince &s;een the hand of the Lord in his pre&s;ervation and continuation among us. I am &s;ure if the Lord had not been on our &s;ide, we &s;hould have been torn to pieces by our enemies. My exerci&s;es of mind were very great, and my friends in Kent, on every &s;ide, entreated me to &s;tay among them; and not to travel at large at the hazard of my life. I was ready at fir&s;t to con&s;ent, but had not &s;taid more than a week among them, when my &s;pirit was &s;tirred within me, and I cried earne&s;t|ly to the Lord to know his will. I felt an impul&s;e to go; that he would &s;tand by me, and defend my cau&s;e. And I received &s;uch a deep &s;en&s;e of God on my heart, and &s;uch precious promi&s;es of his parental care over me, that I took leave of my Kent friends, and &s;et out without any dread of my wor&s;t enemies. I then travelled largely through the country, preaching once, twice, three, and &s;ometimes four times a day, to li&s;ten|ing multitudes bathed in tears.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not &s;oon forget the 24th of June, 1778. O what a wri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing of hands among &s;inners, and crying for mercy! God's peo|ple prai&s;ing him from a &s;en&s;e of his divine
<PB N="79" REF="023401_0078_0FBF5973B052D1B0">pre&s;ence powerfully felt. O how did my heart rejoice in my dear Saviour! I went through Cecil and part of the Delaware &s;tate. A precious flame was kindled in many hearts, and many were brought to enquire what they &s;hould do to be &s;aved. I vi&s;ited Mr. F. A. at Mr. W.'s, and found him very unwell. I had a &s;weet opportu|nity of preaching at Mr. W.'s. After &s;ome agreeable conver&s;ation with Mr. F. A. I went on to Maryland, and had much liber|ty in preaching to our per&s;ecuted friends in Queen Ann.</P>
<P>In this place they threatened to impri&s;on me; but as they did not take me in the public congregation, I concluded they did not intend to lay hands on me: however, the next day, as I was going to Kent, John B. met me on the road (he was formerly judge in that county.) When I came near him, he made a full &s;top as if he wanted &s;omething; apprehending nothing, I &s;top|ped and enquired the di&s;tance to New|town: his reply was, You mu&s;t go to gaol: and in&s;tantly took hold of my hor&s;e's bridle. I de&s;ired him in the Lord's name to take care what he was about to do: a&s;|&s;uring him I was on the Lord's errand, and
<PB N="80" REF="023401_0079_0FBF597531FC4F78">reque&s;ting him to &s;hew his authority for his proceedings. With that, he alighted from his hor&s;e, and taking a large &s;tick that lay in the way, for &s;ome time beat me with it over the head and &s;houlders. Not being far from his quarter, he called aloud for help. I &s;aw &s;everal per&s;ons, as I thought, with a rope, running to his a&s;|&s;i&s;tance. Providentially, at this moment he let go my bridle; had not this been the ca&s;e, it is probable they would have put an end to my life: for the bea&s;ts of the field &s;eemed to be in the utmo&s;t rage. I thought the way was now open for my e&s;cape; and being on an excellent hor&s;e, I gave him the whip, and got a con&s;iderable di&s;|tance before he could mount; but he, knowing the way better than my&s;elf, took a nearer rout, and came in upon me with a full &s;train; and as he pa&s;&s;ed, &s;truck at me with all his might; my hor&s;e immedi|ately made a full &s;top, my &s;addle turned, and I fell with force upon the ground, with my face within an inch of a &s;harp log. The blows I had received, together with my fall and brui&s;es, deprived me of my &s;en&s;es. Providentially, at this time, a wo|man pa&s;&s;ed by with a lancet. I was taken
<PB N="81" REF="023401_0080_0FBF597BE7D5FB98">into a hou&s;e not far di&s;tant, and bled; by which I was re&s;tored to my &s;en&s;es, but it was not expected I had many minutes to live. My affliction was good for me; and I can confidently &s;ay, nothing induced me to wi&s;h to &s;tay any longer in this world, but the thir&s;t I had for the &s;alvation of my fellow-creatures. The heavens, in a very glorious manner, &s;eemed to be open; and by faith I &s;aw my dear Redeemer &s;tanding at the right-hand of the Father, pleading my cau&s;e; and the Father &s;miling, as re|conciled to my poor &s;oul.</P>
<P>I was &s;o happy I could &s;carce contain my&s;elf. My enemy was walking to and fro, in great agitation, wi&s;hing he had not mole&s;ted me. I had a heart to pray for him, and de&s;ired him to &s;it down by me and to read &s;uch and &s;uch chapters. He did &s;o; I told him if he did not experience that ble&s;&s;ed work he would &s;urely go to hell. I &s;aid, if the Lord &s;hould take me away, I had a witne&s;s within me that I &s;hould go to heaven; and that I had &s;uffer|ed purely for the &s;ake of our Lord's ble&s;&s;ed go&s;pel; and that I freely forgave him&punc; and entreated him to &s;eek the &s;alvation of his &s;oul, and never again per&s;ecute the followers
<PB N="82" REF="023401_0081_0FBF597D08643180">of our Lord. The poor, unhappy man did not know which way to look. "I will take you in my carriage," &s;aid he, "wher|ever you want to go." When he perceiv|ed I was likely to recover, he went to a magi&s;trate, who was nearly as bitter again&s;t us as him&s;elf, and brought him to me.</P>
<P>They both appeared as if the enemy was in them. With a &s;tern look the magi&s;trate demanded my name: I told him; and he took out his pen and ink, and began to write a mittimus to commit me to gaol. Pray, &s;ir, &s;aid I, are you a ju&s;tice of the peace? He replied he was: why then, &s;aid I, do you &s;uffer men to behave in this manner? If &s;uch per&s;ons are not taken notice of, a &s;tran|ger can with no degree of &s;afety travel the road. "You have," &s;aid he, "broken the law." How do you know that? an&s;wered I; but &s;uppo&s;e I have, was this the way to put the law in force again&s;t me? I am an inhabitant of, and have property in this &s;tate; and if I mi&s;take not, the law &s;ays, for the fir&s;t offence the &s;ine is five pounds, and double for every offence after. The grand crime was preaching the go&s;pel of our dear Lord and Saviour, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in which I greatly rej<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ice. My enemy,
<PB N="83" REF="023401_0082_0FBF597E461622D0">&s;aid I, conducted him&s;elf more like a high|wayman, than a per&s;on enforcing a law in a Chri&s;tian country. Be well a&s;&s;ured, this matter will be brought to light, &s;aid I, in an awful eternity. He dropped his pen, and made no further attempt to &s;end me to pri&s;on. By this time the woman who bled me, came with a carriage; and I found my&s;elf able to ri&s;e from my bed, and give an exhortation to the magi&s;trate and my per&s;ecutor, and the others who were pre|&s;ent.</P>
<P>I rode to the hou&s;e of old brother D. and preached my dear Ma&s;ter's go&s;pel, with much delight, in the evening, to a few de|&s;pi&s;ed di&s;ciples, as I &s;at in the bed, from the&s;e words, <HI>In me ye &s;hall have peace, in the world ye &s;hall have tribulation; but be of good cheer, for I have overcome the world.</HI> John xvi. 33.</P>
<P>I can truly &s;ay, what I &s;uffered was for my good, and I think it was rendered a ble&s;|&s;ing to the people around: for the work of the Lord was carried on in a ble&s;&s;ed man|ner, and I met with very little per&s;ecution in that county afterwards. (Some time af|ter I preached the funeral &s;ermon of the wife of the above magi&s;trate, and he was
<PB N="84" REF="023401_0083_0FBF597FB115B450">very much moved.) In the morning I awoke about four, and de&s;ired the friend of the hou&s;e, if po&s;&s;ible, to prepare a carriage for me by &s;ix; as I had a long way to go and to preach twice. But being di&s;appointed in getting a conveyance; though &s;carce able to turn in my bed, by body being &s;o brui&s;|ed, I looked to the Lord for help, which was granted with &s;weet con&s;olation. I mounted my hor&s;e about &s;even o'clock, and rode about fifteen miles, and preached at eleven o'clock. O! what a nearne&s;s I had to my dear Lord, while I held up a cruci|fied Je&s;us to upwards of five hundred per|&s;ons! My face brui&s;ed, &s;carred, and be|dewed with tears! the people were for the mo&s;t part much affected. I rode after|wards ten miles further, and preached to hundreds with great freedom. O! how &s;weet my dear Saviour was to me! I &s;eem|ed as if I could have died for him.</P>
<P>After a few days re&s;pite, I went to the place where I was beaten, and found that the per&s;ecuting &s;pirit had in a mea&s;ure &s;ub|&s;ided; and that my way was &s;urpri&s;ingly opened. I had many hearers, and the word was much ble&s;&s;ed to many &s;ouls. The lan|guage of the hearts of many was, Surely this mu&s;t be the right way.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="023401_0084_0FBF5987EAFCAF38">
The Lord was very kind to me in mak|ing a di&s;covery, in a vi&s;ion of the night, of the things I was to pa&s;s through; and they came to pa&s;s ju&s;t as they were made known to me.</P>
<P>From Queen Ann's, I again travelled through the Delaware &s;tate, and had many ble&s;&s;ed opportunities of inforcing the truth on the attentive multitudes that flocked toge|ther from various quarters. In the neigh|bourhood of Mr. S. the people had been deprived of the privilege of hearing for &s;ome time, and when I went among them, I found them hungering for the word. I preached from, <HI>Who is &s;he that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the &s;un, and terrible as an army with banners?</HI> Solomon's Song vi. 10. I was &s;o wonder|fully drawn out, and my &s;pirit &s;o taken up with divine things, that I almo&s;t thought my&s;elf in heaven; and many of the per&s;e|cuted children of God &s;eemed as if they would take wings and fly away. O! it was a great day for an awakening power! and the love-fea&s;t was remarkable for the &s;anctifying operations of the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit. Many of our happy friends came from afar, and returned with their hearts all on fire
<PB N="86" REF="023401_0085_0FBF59890D467FA0">for God. Many happy moments have I had among tho&s;e loving followers of our dear Lord.</P>
<P>Sunday July 19, I vi&s;ited and preached to the people of Ma&s;hey Hope. I was &s;ore|ly tempted of the devil all the morning be|fore preaching; he &s;trove to de&s;troy or weaken my faith. I was afraid I &s;hould not be a means of doing any good. I wept and mourned in &s;ecret at my dear Lord's feet, and &s;en&s;ibly felt the powers of dark|ne&s;s; and as if I never had a commi&s;&s;ion to preach the everla&s;ting go&s;pel. There was an unexpected congregation. And &s;hortly after I &s;tood up before the people, the de|vil and unbelief fled; and I gave out, <HI>How &s;hall we e&s;cape, if we neglect &s;o great &s;al|vation?</HI> Heb. i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. 3. The word ran through all the congregation, and there was a great &s;haking among the people. Among the re&s;t, a woman was &s;truck, and cried aloud for mercy, till &s;he fell to the ground. Her hu&s;band was much offended, and I was in|formed that he threatened me, as he &s;aid, for killing his wife. After &s;ermon I &s;pent &s;ome|time in praying for, and comforting the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. In the afternoon, accompanied by many, I rode four miles, and preached,
<PB N="87" REF="023401_0086_0FBF598A3A490928">from <HI>Cut it down, why cumbereth it the ground?</HI> and I found my&s;elf greatly at liberty. In this place a few months ago, the people were fa&s;t a&s;leep, but now many are awaking up, and &s;everal united to Je|&s;us.</P>
<P>After travelling and preaching with great freedom and &s;ucce&s;s in the Delaware &s;tate, I was brought on my way in the heat of Ju|ly to Talbot county, in Maryland, where I labored for about two weeks night and day with tears. Many &s;ouls were refre&s;hed, and I thought it good for me to be there. Many &s;weet refre&s;hing &s;ea&s;ons had I among tho&s;e dear <HI>loving</HI> people: I &s;hall not &s;oon forget tho&s;e mothers in I&s;rael, &s;i&s;ter P. and &s;i&s;ter B. who are now lodged in Abraham's bo&s;om. They, I tru&s;t, lived and died wit|ne&s;&s;es of perfect love.</P>
<P>In this place the people, e&s;pecially the &s;o|ciety, were much alarmed, and &s;tirred up by an uncommon voice, which was heard three evenings &s;ucce&s;&s;ively; and the la&s;t time &s;eve|ral reputable per&s;ons were pre&s;ent. While they were at prayer, it exhorted them to pray mightily; and when one a&s;ked who it was, it replied, "I am a good &s;pirit." The la&s;t time of its appearance, it &s;eemed to be
<PB N="88" REF="023401_0087_0FBF598BB0FA6BF0">a&s;cending. At the next quarterly-meeting, a man who was awakened by it, aro&s;e and &s;poke powerfully, and &s;aid, "Curio&s;ity that day brought me out, but I was cut to the heart, and re&s;ted not till I found peace to my &s;oul:" of this fact I entertain no doubts.</P>
<P>In Augu&s;t I left Talbot, and accompa|nied by &s;everal friends went to Kent I&s;land. I preached frequently to a very gay high-minded people, with freedom. An admi|rable change for the better has &s;ince taken place in that i&s;land. From thence I attend|ed the Augu&s;t quarterly-meeting in Kent, but had none to a&s;&s;i&s;t me except a few lo|cal &s;peakers; but the Lord was powerfully pre&s;ent, both in public wor&s;hip and at the love-fea&s;t. The hearts of many were glad, and I &s;pake freely and feelingly of the good|ne&s;s of God.</P>
<P>I cannot help thinking the circum&s;tance I am going to relate very remarkable. One day after meeting, my brother John came up to me and &s;hock hands; and looking me very wi&s;hfully in the face, without any caution &s;aid, "I &s;hall never &s;ee you again in this world." And it was even &s;o; for by the time I got round as far as Ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">l, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="89" REF="023401_0088_0FBF5993E0A68540">was taken very ill; and a few hours before I got to his hou&s;e, he was interred on the Ea&s;t &s;ide of the preaching-hou&s;e; where he bid me his la&s;t farewell, not more than two weeks before. He was my &s;econd &s;piritu|al &s;on; and there was an uncommon inti|macy between us. His di&s;&s;olution was re|vealed to him a long time before he died. An eminent phy&s;ician was with him the evening before his death and his wife &s;peak|ing low to the doctor, enquired how &s;oon he &s;uppo&s;ed he would die; he told her he ap|prehended he would not &s;tay till the morn|ing. He over-hearing them, &s;aid, "Doc|tor, I &s;hall not go till eight o'clock in the morning." He was a leader of three cla&s;&s;es, and beloved by all the people of God; and &s;pent much of his time in the public and private exerci&s;es of religion. He had his &s;en&s;es perfectly in his la&s;t moments, and his exhortation which he gave was &s;triking. After exhorting his wife and a brother who lived with him, to &s;tand fa&s;t in the faith; and entreat|ing the &s;ervant to love the Lord; in a very affecting manner he &s;aid, "Now there is but one thing which lies heavy on my mind, and that is, the ca&s;e of two un|converted
<PB N="90" REF="023401_0089_0FBF599731E8F658">brothers. "Tell them," conti|nued he, "from me, I never expect to &s;ee them in heaven" (they lived on the We&s;t|ern &s;hore) "unle&s;s they repent, and turn to the Lord." This he &s;aid to my brother Richard. Not long after they heard the me&s;&s;age, they &s;ought and found the Lord. Thus were his prayers an&s;wered. At eight o'clock, as he &s;aid, he re&s;igned his &s;pirit to his God, a witne&s;s of perfect love.</P>
<P>In September 1778, I again returned to Delaware; and on the 5th for the fir&s;t time, preached at Mr. W.'s in Mu&s;kmelon, a kind man who had been a Quaker. I had for &s;everal days &s;uffered deep exerci&s;es of mind, e&s;pecially while on my way to this place. The devil wanted to per&s;uade me, the Lord was a hard ma&s;ter: and the whole Sabbath morning I was &s;orely tempted. This appointment was made for Mr. F. A. which cau&s;ed my trial to be greater. At the meeting there were between five hun|dred and a thou&s;and people; many of whom came out of curio&s;ity. I preached under a large &s;preading tree; but the wind being high, I concluded to preach the &s;econd &s;er|mon in the hou&s;e; but the hou&s;e could not contain near half the people. I gave out, <HI>One
<PB N="91" REF="023401_0090_0FBF599882AFB6B0">thing I know, whereas I was blind now I &s;ee.</HI> Glory to God! Je&s;us makes u&s;e of clay, in this our day to open the eyes of the blind. While I was in the fir&s;t place de&s;cribing the blindne&s;s of the human mind, my dear Lord di&s;played his almighty power. There was a great weeping and mourning among poor &s;inners: I likewi&s;e felt much happine&s;s, while de&s;cribing the Lord's method in bring|ing &s;inners to him&s;elf, and in &s;hewing the ble&s;&s;ed privileges they enjoy. How many were convinced at this meeting, and how many converted, I will not undertake to &s;ay; but I believe the number of both was great. I &s;hall take notice of one in&s;tance of the power of God at this meeting. A man noted for wickedne&s;s, came cur&s;ing and &s;wearing (as he has &s;ince told me.) But un|der the fir&s;t head of the di&s;cour&s;e, his &s;ins fell, as it were, with the weight of a mill|&s;tone on him, and &s;tared him in the face. "I would," &s;aid he, "have run out; but I was afraid to put one foot before the other, le&s;t I &s;hould drop into hell, for the pit was di&s;clo&s;ed to my view; and I &s;aw no way to e&s;cape it: I thought every minute I &s;hould fall; but I held my&s;elf up by the chair. Oh!" &s;aid he, "under the &s;econd head of
<PB N="92" REF="023401_0091_0FBF599A36603A20">your di&s;cour&s;e, while you were holding up Chri&s;t, I &s;aw a beauty in him; and with|out any dependance on my&s;elf, I ca&s;t my &s;oul on Je&s;us; and in a moment the bur|den fell, and my &s;oul was happy; and I went home rejoicing in my Saviour." I knew him &s;ix years after, and had no cau&s;e to doubt the &s;oundne&s;s of his conver&s;ion. Among the re&s;t an officer was cut to the heart, and &s;oon after threw up his commi&s;|&s;ion; and became a pious follower of Chri&s;t. I do not think I ever &s;aw a more powerful day in a new place. After meeting, the people all around were begging to have preaching at their hou&s;es. Among other places, I appointed to &s;peak at Mr. L.'s who&s;e heart the Lord had touched, he liv|ed in Mother Kill; a place famed for wick|edne&s;s. Previous to my entering this place, the Lord awakened a woman of di&s;tinction, by an earthquake; and &s;he found peace to her &s;oul &s;hortly after I came to the place. And about a year after, &s;he died a witne&s;s of perfect love. I preached at a variety of places all around, and the work of the Lord went on pro&s;perou&s;ly: many being brought into newne&s;s of life, we began to have a little heaven on earth.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="023401_0092_0FBF599EE8A6B918">
When fir&s;t I preached at Mr. L.'s, few came to hear; but the numbers gradually increa&s;ed: &s;ouls were awakened, and I join|ed many to the &s;ociety. In the &s;econd &s;er|mon, among others, a youth by the name of C. B. was awakened, and after a time became a light in the church of God. I preached at his father's, and the work of the Lord pro&s;pering, a large &s;ociety was rai&s;ed in that neighbourhood, which did honor to the cau&s;e of God!</P>
<P>I ble&s;s God for it, I had many hearts, hands, and hou&s;es, opened around me; and many enquired, "What &s;hall I do to be &s;aved?" The people about Mother Kill, were brought up Pre&s;byterians, and their pa&s;tor &s;trove by every means to keep them from the Methodi&s;ts; but all in vain; they were convinced there was more in religion than a mere form. Multitudes gathered to hear the word, and many large &s;ocieties were formed in different places.</P>
<P>September 12th, 1778, was the fir&s;t day of my entering the town of Dover; a pro|verb for wickedne&s;s. I had de&s;ired for &s;ome time to attack this place, but had no open|ing, till an old gentleman came one day and heard me preach at Mr. S.'s: his heart
<PB N="94" REF="023401_0093_0FBF59A5112D7DD0">was touched, and he gave me an invitation to preach in the academy. Scarcely had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> alighted from my hor&s;e before I was &s;ur|rounded by hundreds; &s;ome cried one thing, &s;ome another; &s;ome &s;aid, he is a good man, others &s;aid, nay, he deceiveth the people&mdash;and I was al&s;o accu&s;ed of be|ing a friend to King George. They cried, "He is one of Clowe's men&mdash;hang him&mdash; hang him." I know not what the event would have been, had not the Lord inter|po&s;ed. There were &s;o many tongues go|ing, and voices heard, that I had no po&s;&s;i|ble chance to &s;peak for my&s;elf; and to all human appearance, I was in a fair way to be torn in pieces every moment: I was, however, re&s;cued by &s;everal gentlemen of the town, who hearing the uproar, ran to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>The chief of the&s;e were Mr. P. a mer|chant, who was formerly awakened under Mr. Whitefield, Mr. L. and the alderman of the town. The little Squire pre&s;&s;ed through the croud, Zaccheus like, and taking me by the hand, led me through the mob, de&s;i|ring me to preach and he would &s;tand by me. I mounted the &s;tage at the done of the academy; the people flocked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">,
<PB N="95" REF="023401_0094_0FBF59A5F2E88438">both within and without. And after &s;ing|ing and prayer, I gave out, <HI>If it bear fruit well, and if not, then after that, thou &s;halt cut it down.</HI> My dear Lord was with me of a truth. It was not difficult for me to &s;peak, to be heard a quarter of a mile. Many who did not come to the place, heard me from their gardens and windows. We had much of the pre&s;ence of the Lord with us. We rarely &s;ee &s;uch a weeping com|pany in a new place. One woman was powerfully wrought upon, who &s;at in her window more than a quarter of a mile off. She knew no re&s;t day nor night, till &s;he found a re&s;ting place in her heart for the God of Jacob. It was thought by &s;ome of my Chri&s;tian friends, who accompanied me, that very few of the exten&s;ive congregation were left without a witne&s;s in their hearts, of the truth of what was delivered: More than twenty got the word of truth &s;o fa&s;ten|ed, that they did not de&s;ire to lo&s;e it, and it terminated, I tru&s;t, in a &s;ound conver|&s;ion to the &s;ouls of many.</P>
<P>The mob hung their heads; many of them were affected, and their ringleader &s;aid, he would come and a&s;k my pardon (&s;o I was informed) if he thought I would
<PB N="96" REF="023401_0095_0FBF59A7A0AB9238">forgive him; and I under&s;tood he betook him&s;elf from that day to reading the Bible; and never again per&s;ecuted the children of God&mdash;at lea&s;t to my knowledge.</P>
<P>In the evening I lectured at Mr. S.'s, the old gentleman who had fir&s;t given me an in|vitation to the town; many of the chief people of the place came to hear, and we had a very &s;olemn time. When I with|drew to my room, I was &s;everely buffetted by Satan. I felt as mi&s;erable as Jonah un|der his withered gourd: It was as though I had given all to the people, and had no|thing left for my&s;elf. Ah! &s;aid the enemy, the Lord will make u&s;e of you for the good of others, and then ca&s;t you away, as a pa|rent does a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> rod after correcting the child. I was in &s;uch deep exerci&s;e, that I could &s;carcely clo&s;e my eyes throughout the night, but pa&s;&s;ed the greater part of it away in &s;ighs, and groans, and &s;ilence, before the Lord. I believe I was permitted to be thus tried in order to keep me at the feet of my dear Lord, and hope I &s;hall be always thankful for his kind dealings with me.</P>
<P>Monday, September 13th, I preached a few miles out of town, accompanied by
<PB N="97" REF="023401_0096_0FBF59AFB84CBC28">many, and the Lord was with us. In the af|ternoon I returned and found many mourn|ing after Chri&s;t; but the devil and &s;ome of his adherents were &s;triving to make them believe, that what I had told them was a delu&s;ion; but they were not &s;ucce&s;sful. I joined tho&s;e who were deeply awakened in|to a &s;ociety; and the Lord was with them, &s;preading his work and converting the &s;ouls of many: among the re&s;t there was an old lady &s;tripped of her own righteou&s;ne&s;s, who had been a communicant in the church for many years; al&s;o ten of her children with their hu&s;bands and wives were brought un|der concern for their &s;ouls. I preached at her hou&s;e, and &s;ixteen or eighteen of her children and children in law were pre&s;ent. The old lady was mourning; but &s;everal of them the Lord had &s;et at liberty; and before many months he vi&s;ited the old lady with his forgiving love, as well as the mo&s;t of her children. Such a family as this I have &s;eldom &s;een in any part of America.</P>
<P>The fields appeared white for harve&s;t; but the laborers were very few; and I was engaged in &s;trong cries to the Lord, to open the way and &s;end out more; and ble&s;|&s;ed be his name, it was &s;o; for he rai&s;ed
<PB N="98" REF="023401_0097_0FBF59B13AC8B8A8">up &s;everal young men, and &s;ent others from the We&s;tern &s;hore. I wrote to brother F. A. who was at Mr. W.'s, informing him how matters were, and that his way was open into any part of the &s;tate, and I reque&s;ted him to make a vi&s;it to Dover: which he did, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> brought in many whom I could not reach. The Lord gave us great favor in the fight of Dr. M. mini&s;ter of the church, and he proved a great ble&s;&s;ing to the cau&s;e of Method<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">m. The prejudices of the peo|ple began to fall a&s;toni&s;hingly; and there was a great gathering to the connection from all quarters, and hundreds enabled to rejoice in the Kingdom of Grace.</P>
<P>The 19th of September, 1778, I at|tended the funeral of my brother, and a &s;olemn &s;ea&s;on it was; my younge&s;t brother was there from Baltimore, a wild youth, but the Lord laid his convincing hand up|on him, and he returned a penitent mourn|er: he could &s;tay but a few weeks till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> returned to &s;ee me, and continued with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> till the Lord &s;et his &s;oul at liberty.</P>
<P>Monday September 20th, as I was walk|ing and meditating through the fields, I heard the cries of one on the top of a tree: and lifting up my eyes, I &s;aw a man about
<PB N="99" REF="023401_0098_0FBF59B2CB9C3AA0">taking his own life; a rope was tied to a limb with a noo&s;e in it, and the poor wretch bemoaning him&s;elf thus&mdash;"O what a wretch I am; once I had a day of grace, but now it is a gone ca&s;e with me!&mdash;I may as well put an end to my wretched life!" He then made a motion to put the rope over his head, bid|ding the world farewell. I in&s;tantly called out to him, and told him to &s;top a few mi|nutes while I conver&s;ed with him. He did; and after &s;ome time I per&s;uaded him to give over his wicked intention, and come down from the tree. In the cour&s;e of our con|ver&s;ation, I found the good Spirit had from time to time &s;trove with him, and he had rejected the offers of mercy: till at length the arch-fiend per&s;uaded hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> his day of grace was pa&s;t; and that he had better know his doom as quick as po&s;&s;ible. My being an in&s;trument (to human appearance) of &s;aving the life of a human being, as well as, perhaps, an immortal &s;oul, was no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> comfort to me.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day I rode as far as Queen Ann's, and found a very pro&s;perous work going on. I was very comfortable in my dear Lord; and experienced it was &s;weet to wait o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> him in &s;ecret. I found many hungering
<PB N="100" REF="023401_0099_0FBF553BECB15478">for the word, and had liberty in preach|ing.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day, September 22d, I awoke and aro&s;e early from my pillow, and felt a great nearne&s;s to the Lord, and had a &s;weet time in &s;ecret. I vi&s;ited poor John W. a brother of the Dr. and &s;ound him near death, in his &s;ins. In his health he was a great per&s;ecutor; but now a penitent, be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ing the prayers of tho&s;e he once de&s;pi&s;ed. O! how did he warn his old companion to flee from their &s;ins; and to take exam|ple by him. I was greatly affected with his &s;ituation, and did not find freedom to leave him in the arms of the devil. "O! cri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> he, I am &s;leeping over hell!" I prayed with him frequently, and &s;till it bore upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> mind, you mu&s;t not leave him.

<PB N="102" REF="023401_0101_0FBF553F7AB14C90">of preaching in a fore&s;t, to hundreds who gathered morning and afternoon, to hear the new doctrine: and &s;uppo&s;e many of them expected to be greatly diverted&punc; for they were a people who had neither the form nor power of godline&s;s.

Some of the people
<PB N="103" REF="023401_0102_0FBF55421DF33C80">among whom I went, appeared as familiar to me, as if I had been there frequently before. It &s;eemed as if the Lord opened the way before me, &s;tep by &s;tep.</P>
<P>Monday September 25th, I preached a funeral &s;ermon in the &s;ame neighbourhood; and the devil &s;ent out a woman with a pi&s;|tol or two to &s;hoot me: and while I was preaching from, <HI>Acquaint now thy&s;elf with him, and be at peace, thereby good &s;hall come unto thee,</HI> Job xxii. 21. &s;he came in; and made &s;o much noi&s;e that I &s;topped till they put her out and &s;hut the door. O! how precious this &s;ea&s;on was to me! And the divine power was &s;en&s;ibly felt among the people. After the &s;ermon many hung around me in tears, begging of me to pray for them, and likewi&s;e to vi&s;it them, and not to let the di&s;turbance prevent my com|ing among them again.</P>
<P>The wife of Mr. N. a merchant in Sa|li&s;bury, was powerfully awakened; and many others who came from a di&s;tance. This part of the world was famous for gambling and dancing; but as the word &s;pread, the&s;e vices fell; until there was &s;carce a frolic heard of in Broad-creek. About this place I joined many broken-hearted

<P>Saturday Nov. 7th, on my way to Tal|bot quarterly meeting, I preached at Mr. P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">'s, and two very dre&s;&s;y young women, who came on a vi&s;it to their relations, were wounded, and I left them crying for mercy.</P>
<P>On Sunday Nov. 8th, quarterly meeting began. Brother P. preached a very u&s;eful &s;ermon; and I found freedom to di&s;cour&s;e on Solomon's chariot: the people were en|gaged and &s;olemn.</P>
<P>Monday 9th, love-fea&s;t began in the morning, and it was a refre&s;hing time. Many rejoiced in the Lord, and &s;pake free|ly and feelingly of what God had done for them. After the love-fea&s;t I found great freedom to preach from, <HI>The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation,</HI> 2 Peter ii. 9. and we had a time not &s;oon to be forgotten among the children of God.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day Nov. 10th, I called again at Mr. P.'s, and found tho&s;e young women dre&s;&s;ed very plain, and under deep di&s;tre&s;s. In the evening I read and lectured on the
<PB N="105" REF="023401_0104_0FBF554939917CE0">16th of John, and the Lord was with us of a truth. The power of the Lord was &s;en&s;ibly felt, and his pre&s;ence filled the room, where about fifteen of us were met for prayer. Brother H. my brother Rich|ard (who had come from &s;ome di&s;tance to &s;ee me) and my&s;elf, continued in prayer, exclu&s;ive of the time we &s;pent in &s;inging and exhorting, from about eight o'clock till near two; and in that time five &s;ouls were &s;et at liberty: the two young women of whom I have &s;poken, Dr. W. and his two &s;i&s;ters, who came from a di&s;tance to quarterly meeting.

<P>Wedne&s;day Nov. 11th, greatly refre&s;hed and &s;trengthened. I &s;et out again on my way to Somer&s;et, and found my young di&s;|ciples growing in grace, and increa&s;ing in number. In my way round, having an invitation from Mr. N. I preached in Sa|li&s;bury, where the Lord began a ble&s;&s;ed work; but the devil &s;trove to &s;top it; for he rai&s;ed up enemies again&s;t me, who &s;ent the &s;heriff with a writ to take me to gaol.

In April 1779, I was led &s;till farther in the wilderne&s;s, to enlarge the circuit; and though I met with a variety of trials, and was &s;everely buffeted by Satan; yet my Lord was with me daily.

One day I was wandering through the wilderne&s;s in &s;earch of poor lo&s;t &s;heep, and called at &s;everal hou&s;es; but they did not want me.

I told him, I was a follower of our ble&s;&s;ed Savi|our; and a&s;ked him, if he would join me in prayer? I then read the 7th chapter of Matthew, and lectured from it; and found great &s;weetne&s;s in prayer.

<P>As my brethren, in rotation, began to travel largely through this part of the work, I had an opportunity to vi&s;it the friends in various parts of Maryland; and found it good for me to be among old, e&s;tabli&s;hed Chri&s;tians.

<P>Sunday, June 7th. I &s;pent the morning in retirement, &s;orely tempted by the devil; and after I went to my appointed place, my mind was &s;o bewildered, I thought there was not a text in all the Bible that I could &s;peak from. I felt my&s;elf le&s;s than the lea&s;t. At eleven o'clock there was &s;uch a number col|lected, that I was obliged to preach under the trees. I had been before the people but a few minutes, till the Lord ble&s;t me with great light, and the Bible &s;eemed all plain to me. I am &s;ure if I had held the Quaker principle, I &s;hould not have attempted to &s;peak; but glory to God! it proved a day of days to many others as well as my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Whenever the Lord begins his work in any place, the devil and his children are &s;ure to ri&s;e up again&s;t it. After preaching I &s;et out for my afternoon's appointment, accompanied by about thirty, who&s;e hearts the Lord had touched. I was pur&s;ued by a party of men who way-laid me, and the head of the company, with a gun pre&s;ented, com|manded
<PB N="117" REF="023401_0116_0FBF556EC66DEB78">me to &s;top. Several of the women who were with us &s;urpri&s;ed me; they were in an in&s;tant off their hor&s;es, and &s;eizing hold of his gun, held it until I pa&s;&s;ed by. That &s;ame man was a penitent &s;ome time after, and became a member of the &s;ociety. I went on and preached at old Mr. T&mdash;'s, to a large, attentive company, and united a pro&s;perous &s;ociety.</P>
<P>I am not &s;urpri&s;ed at the devil's rattling his chains, for his kingdom is coming down very fa&s;t. It appeared as if hundreds in the congregation were more or le&s;s wrought upon, and many appeared to be broken hearted. We could never get a &s;ociety in this place till now. I know the day when the Lord began his work in the Fork; I preached from the&s;e words, <HI>And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torment;</HI> and in|tended, if I &s;aw no fruit to leave them: but ble&s;&s;ed be God, he vi&s;ited the place <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> mercy, and the devil's kingdom is like to receive a wonderful &s;hock.</P>
<P>Monday June 8th. Why does the evil one hara&s;s me in this manner? If po&s;&s;ible, a legion of devils are around me I am at|tacked on all &s;ides&mdash;&s;ighting within and per|&s;ecution without. I rode about eight miles,
<PB N="118" REF="023401_0117_0FBF557107ADA320">and the devil followed me all the way, and frequently told me, "You are a fool, and may as well go back;" and after I got there, he told me, "my journey would be fruitle&s;s." I withdrew and mourned be|fore the Lord, and entreated him to grant that the devil might be di&s;appointed; and &s;o it was, for a large number attended at eleven o'clock, and we had much of the divine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">efence.

<P>Tue&s;day June 9, I preached at I. T.'s. My mind was greatly di&s;turbed all the morning by the enemy of &s;ouls: &s;o that I could not keep it fixed upon one thing for a minute at a time; which was a great grief to me. It is &s;urpri&s;ing that the devil &s;hould have power to carry the mind, in the manner he does, to the ends of the earth; but though he has power to tempt, he cannot force us to give way to the temptation; this mu&s;t be with the concur|rence of the will. We had a large gather|ing of the people here, and a &s;olemn time.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day June 10th. What is the devil afraid of? Why does he cha&s;e me in this manner? I do not know that I have
<PB N="119" REF="023401_0118_0FBF5574783144E8">given way to &s;in, either inwardly or out|wardly; and yet he tells me frequently, "my commi&s;&s;ion is run out, and that my labors never will be ble&s;&s;ed again." I have had great &s;truggling in my mind, to know my &s;tanding; not that I doubt my adopti|on into the family of heaven; but re&s;pect|ing my &s;alvation from all inward &s;in. From this quarter have ari&s;en my greate&s;t fears for more than 12 months pa&s;t. I know that my dear Lord has given me power to &s;erve him, and that I love him &s;upremely; but the&s;e are comprehen&s;ive words, <HI>to love the Lord with all the heart.</HI> My wi&s;hes have frequently gone up, de&s;irous of a &s;tronger a&s;&s;urance of this perfect love which ca&s;teth out fear. I have thought &s;ometimes that I &s;hould doubt no more; but fearfulne&s;s hath kept me back.</P>
<P>This day I felt &s;trangely: I was &s;o bur|dened (not with guilt, ble&s;&s;ed be God) that I could &s;carcely bear my own weight. None know what I mean, but &s;uch as have re|ceived a commi&s;&s;ion to deliver a me&s;&s;age for the Lord. The prophet knew when he cried out, <HI>The burden of the Lord</HI>&mdash;Jonah knew &s;omething of it when he was called to go to Nineveh&mdash;and Jeremiah was well
<PB N="120" REF="023401_0119_0FBF557A21F0FED0">acquainted with exerci&s;es of this kind. It is a &s;weet thing to preach the go&s;pel, but the cro&s;s is to be borne. I remember the words of St. John, who eat the little book; in his mouth it was &s;weet, but it made his belly bitter.</P>
<P>I cro&s;&s;ed the river and went to my ap|pointment, which was at I. M.'s on Broad|creek. The people a&s;&s;embled from all quar|ters; and many came out who were ene|mies to the way, and &s;ome from afar. I had &s;carce opened my mouth when my burden dropped off: and in an uncommon manner I was let into the Holy Scriptures; and the flame ran from heart to heart. I felt as though I had almo&s;t faith enough to remove mountains. One thing was no|ticed not only by my friends, but likewi&s;e by tho&s;e who were enemies&mdash;There had been a great drought, &s;o that the vegetable creation hung in mourning; and it was thought by many they would lo&s;e their crops, if it continued much longer. In a particular manner I was led to pray for rain; and a few minutes after the congre|gation was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, the face of the &s;ky was covered with blackne&s;s, and we had a plentiful &s;hower; which greatly &s;urpri&s;ed
<PB N="121" REF="023401_0120_0FBF557B765F6B18">and convinced the people. I was now hap|py enough to &s;ee the pro&s;perity of the young converts. Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Lord was plentifully watering the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th, I collected the family for prayer; and we had a great time of refre&s;hing from the pre&s;ence of the Lord.

And this flame continued with me till &s;ome time in the night, I then &s;weetly re&s;ted in the arms of my Lord.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day June 11th, I preached to a poor people. Some who came from a di&s;|tance thought I pointed my di&s;cour&s;e at them. Thur&s;day was a very &s;olemn day of fa&s;ting. I have noticed that the evil one is more &s;piteful on my fa&s;t-days than at other times. But I feel there is a ne|ce&s;&s;ity of keeping my body under, le&s;t af|ter preaching to others I &s;hould be a ca&s;t|away. My public labors this day, as I was among a curious people, were to reconcile <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;eeming contradictions in &s;cripture. After I had done, I was warmly oppo&s;ed
<PB N="122" REF="023401_0121_0FBF557DE1D7E120">by an enemy to the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t. I vi|&s;ited one of the &s;piritual children of Mr. Whitefield, on her death-bed; and I tru&s;t her &s;oul was happy in the Lord.</P>
<P>In the evening I met and examined a large &s;ociety, and we had a comfortable time. I had a &s;weet night's re&s;t, and awoke at my u&s;ual hour with a happy mind, and prayed earne&s;tly to the Lord, to grant that every moment of my life might be given to him.</P>
<P>I rode to Quantico to vi&s;it the young lambs. I expected that the Lord intended to do &s;omething for them, for the devil pur&s;ued me all the way even till I got to the place. An unexpected congregation a&s;&s;embled in the afternoon, and the Lord was with us of a truth. Several were &s;et at liberty; and the cries of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed were heard&mdash;Sweet Je&s;us, thou art lovely to my &s;oul!&mdash;O Je&s;us! thou ha&s;t overcome me with thy looks, and the ki&s;&s;es of thy lips!

<PB N="123" REF="023401_0122_0FBF5585E58675E8">in wre&s;tling with the Lord for a ble&s;|&s;ing on my labors. I preached at old bro|ther R.'s at eleven o'clock: the old judge, who came as a hearer, gave great attenti|on; and we had a melting time. I rode ten miles to Sali&s;bury; when I came in, the man of the hou&s;e took me into a room; and told me I had better leave the town immediately; for a mob was waiting, and intended to &s;end me to gaol; "They came to my hou&s;e la&s;t night," &s;aid he, "expect|ing to find you here; but when they found you not, they laid hold on me, and drag|ging me down the chamber-&s;tairs, hauled me along the &s;treet till my arms were as black as ink from my wri&s;ts to my &s;houl|ders; and I know not what would have been the con&s;equence, if I had not been re&s;cued by a magi&s;trate."

<P>Sunday June 21, I was to preach at the Sound. In the morning I intended meeting the &s;ociety at eight o'clock; but &s;uch a crowd gathered that I declined it; and preached a &s;ermon. At twelve about 1500 gathered, and the Lord made bare his arm under the &s;preading trees. After a &s;hort intermi&s;&s;ion, I preached another &s;ermon: and it &s;eemed as if the whole country would turn to the Lord. While

<P>Sunday June 28th, when I came to bro|ther W.'s in Mu&s;kmelon, I found that a Nicolite preacher had been &s;owing his feed in the young &s;ociety, and endeavouring to de&s;troy the new-born children. He told them, "It was a &s;in to wear any kind of clothing that was colored; and that they ought never to pray but when they had an immediate impul&s;e, and that it was wrong to &s;ing." Many people came together, but I perceived a con&s;iderable alteration; for &s;ome would not &s;ing at all, and others &s;at both in time of &s;inging and prayer.

I gave out my text, <HI>The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteou&s;ne&s;s, and peace, and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> Rom. xiv. 17. My dear Lord made bare his arm, and humbled me among them; and there was a &s;haking, convincing power. After &s;ermon was end|ed, I met the &s;ociety and excluded the leader and one or two more; tho&s;e that re|mained took a fre&s;h &s;tart, and grew more than ever.

<P>Sunday July 5th, I preached in Dover a little after &s;un-ri&s;e, then rode four miles and preached at brother B.'s at nine, to hundreds who &s;tood and &s;at under the trees for want of room in the hou&s;e from <HI>Behold a &s;ower went forth to &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w,</HI> Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t. xiii. 3.

<P>DURING my &s;tay in the Penin&s;ula, on this vi&s;it, which was about fifteen months, &s;everal new circuits were formed; hundreds entered in the &s;ociety; a great re|formation had taken place; great numbers were really and powerfully converted to God; and &s;everal preachers rai&s;ed.

<P>I &s;taid about two months in Philadel|phia, and as it was &s;hortly after the Briti&s;h troops left that city, there was much con|fu&s;ion in the &s;ociety, as well as among the people at large: I met with a variety of tri|als, and &s;aw very little fruit of my labors. But many of our dear friends were near,
<PB N="137" REF="023401_0136_0FBF55B2E8562430">dear, and precious to me: and frequently &s;ince that time I have had a great de&s;ire to &s;pend a few months in that city.</P>
<P>I ble&s;s and prai&s;e my dear Lord, for the pro&s;perous journey he gave me through the Jer&s;eys: &s;everal were awakened, and &s;ome brought to know Je&s;us. One day, after preaching, an old man came to me and &s;aid, all in tears, "This day I am an hun|dred and one years old, and this is my &s;pi|ritual birth-day." The dear man's &s;oul was &s;o exceedingly happy, that he appeared to be ready to take his &s;light to heaven.</P>
<P>I preached at a new place, where the congregation con&s;i&s;ted mo&s;tly of young people, from, <HI>The Son of man is come to &s;eek and to &s;ave that which was lo&s;t,</HI> Luke xix. 10. We had a wonderful di&s;play of the power of the Lord. After I had fini&s;h|ed, the young people hung around each other crying for mercy; and I believe ma|ny will prai&s;e the Lord eternally for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> day.

She at length fell from God, and became as wild and trifling as ever. Soon after this &s;he was entirely deprived of her &s;peech; and the enemy of her &s;oul per&s;uaded her to believe, it was a &s;in for her to do any kind of work, or even to dre&s;s her&s;elf; and if they gave her a book to read &s;he thought it &s;inful to turn over a leaf, and would read no more, unle&s;s &s;ome one would do this office for her. It was impre&s;&s;ed on her mind that there was a people in &s;uch a place, that &s;erved the Lord; and if &s;he could get among them, they would be a ble&s;&s;ing to her; and &s;he would be re&s;tored to her &s;peech. She had never heard of a Metho|di&s;t; and the place which was revealed to her was near twenty miles off, where there was a young, loving &s;ociety. Though &s;he knew nothing of the way, &s;he &s;et off to find that place and people. Her family mi&s;&s;ing her, pur&s;ued and brought her back. Not long after &s;he made a more &s;ucce&s;sful &s;it|tempt, and found the &s;ociety. The Lord revealed her ca&s;e to them. There was a preacher pre&s;ent, Mr. D. R. who being
<PB N="139" REF="023401_0138_0FBF55B8196D2F90">agreed, they called a meeting, and cried to the Lord in her behalf that day and the next; &s;he then went into a private room, kneeled down to prayer, and continued therein till the Lord ble&s;&s;ed her &s;oul. At the &s;ame time her tongue was loo&s;ened, and &s;he could &s;peak forth the prai&s;es of I&s;|rael's God. She had been dumb about two years. Some time after, I came into this neighbourhood and &s;ent word to her mo|ther, I would preach &s;uch a day at her hou&s;e. When the day arrived, I took the young woman home, accompanied by ma|ny friends, and we were received like an|gels: &s;ome thought the Methodi&s;ts could work miracles.

<HEAD>SECTION VII. <HI>An Account of my Travels after I was re|lea&s;ed from Pri&s;on.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AFTER preaching in a variety of pla|ces in the Jer&s;eys and Penn&s;ylvania, with great freedom; in the fail I returned to the Penin&s;ula (which was my &s;econd vi&s;it) and we had a ble&s;&s;ed quarterly meet|ing at Mr. W.'s I travelled largely through this country all the winter; and many were gathered into the fold. I would &s;ay &s;ome|thing here of the beginning and progre&s;s of the work of God in Dor&s;et county&mdash;a place where they were generally of the church of England; and univer&s;ally enemies to the life and power of religion. The work be|gan by the means of a young woman who was niece to, and &s;ome times lived with judge E. of Dor&s;et: her &s;i&s;ter was wife to the honorable Mr. B. I am not certain whether it was on a vi&s;it to Queen Ann's or Dover, that &s;he fell in with the Methodi&s;ts, by who&s;e means &s;he was convinced and con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erted; and afterwards became a pious fol|lower of the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us. When &s;he re|turned to her uncle's in Dor&s;et, they began
<PB N="141" REF="023401_0140_0FBF55BF0072F998">to think &s;he was be&s;ide her&s;elf; however, the Lord ble&s;&s;ed her endeavours in favor of her &s;i&s;ter Polly, and a few others. Her fi&s;ter was &s;oon &s;et at liberty in a powerful manner, and had as great a zeal for God as her &s;i&s;ter Catharine. Shortly after, their &s;i&s;ter B. became as ble&s;&s;ed a woman as ever I &s;aw; and I have not a doubt but that &s;he lived and died a bright witne&s;s of &s;anctifi|cation. Mr. B. was brought into the faith, with two young lawyers who were &s;tudying under him, and &s;everal others of the fami|ly; who were the fruits of the labors of the&s;e pious, I may &s;ay, ble&s;&s;ed women. To return; &s;ome time after Mary's conver|&s;ion, &s;he went to vi&s;it H. A. <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who was a relation of hers. As he was a man of fa&s;hi|on, and an entire &s;tranger to Inward reli|gion, he was much a&s;raid &s;he would drive his wife out of her &s;en&s;es. He undertook to &s;hew his <HI>vi&s;itor</HI> that the Methodi&s;ts were not in the right way; and for this p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rpo&s;e he cho&s;e an old book written by a Puritan divine, an hundred and fifty years ago: but he had not read many minutes before conviction &s;eized <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">m, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> from his eyes. He withdrew and read, till be thought he mu&s;t go among the Metho|di&s;ts
<PB N="142" REF="023401_0141_0FBF55C08E09D770">with his book, and compare it with theirs. He did &s;o, and found the Methodi&s;t publications to agree in &s;ub&s;tance with that. On this occa&s;ion I fir&s;t met with him at Mr. W.'s. After he had labored &s;ome time under di&s;tre&s;s of &s;oul, the Lord gave him re&s;t&mdash;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> he burden of guilt removed&mdash; and now expre&s;&s;ed an anxious de&s;ire that I &s;hould come to the county where he re&s;ided, being determined to &s;tand by the cau&s;e as long as he lived.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day Feb. 10th, 1780, I aro&s;e very early in the morning, and addre&s;&s;ed the throne of grace. My dear Ma&s;ter wonder|fully refre&s;hed my &s;oul, and I felt a will|ingne&s;s to &s;uffer any thing, whatever the Lord might permit to come upon me, for his work's &s;take. I opened my mind to Mr. F. A. who was at Mr. W.'s, and he &s;eemed very de&s;irous I &s;hould accept the invitation. He then commended me to the Lord in prayer, and I &s;et out in good &s;pirits with a &s;trong hope that good would be done. The fir&s;t day I got half way, and had a com|fortable night. February 11th was a day of deep exerci&s;e. Are others di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in the way that I have been? I travelled on &s;eep|ingly with the weight of a mill-&s;tone. I
<PB N="143" REF="023401_0142_0FBF55C8EDE91128"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> bitterly as I pa&s;&s;ed along, and &s;everal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es &s;topped my hor&s;e, intending to turn back, but was &s;till urged on my way. I got to my dear friend Mr. A.'s, &s;ome time before night; and the burden which I felt all the way, left me at his door. The di&s;|mi&s;&s;ion of it was perceptible, for my &s;pirit did rejoice in God my Saviour. I was con|ducted into a private room, where the Lord let me know that I was in the very place he would have me to be.</P>
<P>In the evening the family were gathered together for prayer: I &s;hall never forget the time: I &s;uppo&s;e about twelve white and black were pre&s;ent. The power of the Lord came among us: Mrs. A. was &s;o &s;illed with the new wine of Chri&s;t's kingdom, that &s;he &s;unk to the floor, ble&s;&s;ing and prai&s;ing the Lord. And many of the blacks were much wrought upon. This night was a time of great refre&s;hment to me.</P>
<P>Saturday 12. About thirty of the neigh|bours were called together; and the word &s;eemed to melt their hearts. I had not the lea&s;t doubt, but the Lord had called me to this place.</P>
<P>Sunday 13. Near an hundred gathered: the field, though in the winter, &s;eemed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="144" REF="023401_0143_0FBF55CA5133CF00">for harve&s;t; and my gracious God wrong <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> wonderfully in the hearts of the people; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that &s;ome who were enemies before ac|knowledged it to be the truth.</P>
<P>Monday the 14th, accompanied by my friend, I went to the other part of the county. The field is ripe. One man was deeply affected only by &s;eeing us. I preach|ed at colonel V.'s, a clever man, who after|wards became a great friend to us and him|&s;elf too.&mdash;The fields are white for harve&s;t&mdash; The devil is angry&mdash;The wicked rage, and invent lies and mi&s;chief. The county court was &s;itting, and &s;ome of the heads of it were determined, by &s;ome means or other, to clear the place of &s;uch a trouble&s;ome fel|low. For a cloak they charged me with to|ryi&s;m: and I was informed, gave a very wicked man leave, and promi&s;ed to bear him out, in taking my life; and for this purpo&s;e he was to lay in wait for me the next day. It providentially reached my ears that night before I went to bed, and as the wicked &s;eemed thus inclined, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hought it expedient to withdraw to Mr. A.'s, where I &s;taid two days; but being pre&s;&s;ed in &s;pi|rit, I could &s;tay no longer; I went to ano|ther part of the county. Many came ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="145" REF="023401_0144_0FBF55CBC5EAC158"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ear, and the word was &s;till attended <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> power; for they began to enquire the way to heaven.</P>
<P>I had a mo&s;t remarkable vi&s;ion of the night. And in that vi&s;ion it was revealed to me what I was to &s;uffer; and that the Lord would &s;tand by me, &s;o that my ene|mies &s;hould not injure me. Hundreds flock|ed out to hear the word; on one &s;ide &s;in|ners were enquiring what they &s;hould do to be &s;aved; and tho&s;e on the other &s;ide; how they &s;hould manage in order to bani&s;h me from the place.</P>
<P>Monday 21. I had great &s;atisfaction in reading a piece that treated on the human &s;oul.&mdash;I had much freedom in the word in public, and a ble&s;&s;ed family meeting at my good friend A.'s; but &s;orely tempted of the devil. Shortly after (&s;hall I &s;peak the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">? I will without the fear of man though the&s;e things may appear &s;trange to &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">) I went to bed, the devil made his a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ance upon it: fir&s;t he felt like a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> then got hold of my pillow: I how b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ed it to be the fiend, and was not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ed; I took hold of the pillow, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> pulled at it; I cried out, get behind me, Sa|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. And immediately he vani&s;hed. I
<PB N="146" REF="023401_0145_0FBF55CD355482F8">went down &s;tairs in the morning, intending not to &s;peak of what had pa&s;t: but brother A. enquired if I had been down in the night; I told him I had not; "why," &s;aid he, "&s;hortly after you went up, I came into the hall, and was at prayer, when I heard &s;ome one walk down &s;tairs, and &s;eemed to be &s;tanding at the door: as I knew there was none above but your&s;elf, I concluded it mu&s;t be you that wi&s;hed to go out; I therefore went and opened the door, but &s;aw no body, and certainly it was the devil." This was about the preci&s;e time he left my bed. Poor devil, you are afraid of your kingdom. I then mentioned what had pa&s;t in my chamber. The little daugh|ter was under &s;ome concern of &s;oul, and getting up one night, awoke her parents, and told them &s;he was afraid the devil would carry her away. The &s;oul &s;pirit was wonderfully rou&s;ed, and very bitter again&s;t this dear family.</P>
<P>February 24, I had a &s;weet and power|ful time. After I went to re&s;t I was &s;trange|ly exerci&s;ed in my &s;leep: I thought I &s;aw an innocent creature cha&s;ed almo&s;t to death, by a company of dreadful beings; after a while I &s;aw a cloud about the &s;ize of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="147" REF="023401_0146_0FBF55D06F479F58">hand ri&s;ing in the We&s;t, which grew black|er and darker, till it appeared to cover the earth: I thought now, mo&s;t &s;urely the world is to be at an end. I &s;aw after a while tho&s;e cruel beings turn pale as death. I &s;aw a per&s;on come up to the innocent creature, which they were cha&s;ing, and re|ceive it. I awoke rejoicing, but knew not how to interpret this dream.</P>
<P>Saturday 25, my &s;pirit was &s;olemn and weighty: expecting &s;omething uncommon would turn up. I withdrew to the woods, and &s;pent much time before the Lord. I preached with freedom to a weeping flock, my friend A. accompanying me to the place. In the evening we were repairing to his hou&s;e, being about to preach there the next day; but a parcel of men embodied them|&s;elves and way-laid me, with an intention to take me to gaol. About &s;un-&s;et they &s;ur|rounded us, and called me their pri&s;oner. They beat my hor&s;e, cur&s;ed and &s;wore, but did not &s;trike me. Some time after night they took me to a magi&s;trate who was as much my enemy as any of them. When I was judged, and condemned for preaching the go&s;pel, the keeper of the peace, who &s;at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> his great chair, immediately wrote a mit|timus
<PB N="148" REF="023401_0147_0FBF55D828DBBF50">and ordered me to gaol. I a&s;ked him if he had never heard of an affair in Tal|bot county. Brother I. H. was committed to gaol for the &s;ame crime, that of preach|ing the go&s;pel: &s;oon after the magi&s;trate was taken &s;ick unto death, and &s;ent for this &s;ame preacher out of confinement to pray for him. He then made this confe&s;|&s;ion, "When I &s;ent you to gaol," &s;aid he, "I was fighting again&s;t God, and now I am about to leave the world, pray for me." His family were called in, and he &s;aid to his wife, "This is a &s;ervant of God: and when I die, I reque&s;t he may preach at my funeral. You need not think I have not my &s;en&s;es; this is the true faith." He then gave brother I. H. charge of his family, and de&s;ired them to embrace that profe&s;&s;i|on. Now, &s;aid I, I be&s;eech you to think <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">riou&s;ly of what you have done, and pre|pare to meet God. Be you a&s;&s;ured, I am not a&s;hamed of the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, for I con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters"> it as an honor to be impri&s;oned for the go&s;pel of my dear Lord. My hor&s;e was brought, and about twelve of the company were to attend me to gaol. They were all around me; and two, one on each &s;ide, holding my hor&s;e's bridle. The night was
<PB N="149" REF="023401_0148_0FBF55D934AF4A18">very dark; and before we got a mile from the hou&s;e, on a &s;udden there was a very un|common fla&s;h of lightning, and in le&s;s than a minute all my fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s were di&s;per&s;ed: my friend A. was a little before the company. How, or where, I know not, but I was left alone. I was reminded of that place of &s;cripture, where our dear Lord's ene|mies fell to the ground, and then, this por|tion of &s;cripture came to me, <HI>Stand &s;till, and &s;ee the &s;alvation of God.</HI> It was a very dark cloudy night, and had rained a little. I &s;at on my hor&s;e alone, and though I called &s;everal times, there was no an&s;wer. I went on, but had not got far before I met my friend Mr. A. returning to look for me. He had accompanied me through|out the whole of this affair. We rode on talking of the goodne&s;s of God, till we came to a little cottage by the road &s;ide, where we found two of my guards almo&s;t &s;cared out of their wits. I told them if I was to go to gaol that night, we ought to be on our way, for it was getting late.&mdash; "O! no," &s;aid one of them, "let us &s;tay until the morning." My friend and I rode on, and it was not long, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re we had a beau|tiful clear night. We had not rode far,
<PB N="150" REF="023401_0149_0FBF55DAB4FC5C90">before the company had gathered, from whence I know not. However, they ap|peared to be amazingly intimidated, and the foreman of the company rode along &s;ide of me, and &s;aid, "Sir, do you think the affair happened on our account?" I told him, that I would have him to judge for him&s;elf; reminding him of the awful|ne&s;s of the day of judgment, and the nece&s;|&s;ity there was of preparing to meet the judge of the whole earth. One of the com|pany &s;wore an oath, and another immedi|ately reproved him, &s;aying, "How can you &s;wear at &s;uch a time as this?" At length the company &s;topt, and one &s;aid, "We had better give him up for the pre&s;ent;" &s;o they turned their hor&s;es and went back. My friend and I pur&s;ued our way. True it is, <HI>The wicked are like the troubled &s;ea, who&s;e water ca&s;ts up mire and dirt.</HI> We had not gone far before they pur&s;ued us again, and &s;aid '"We cannot give him up." They accompanied us a few minutes, and again left us, and we &s;aw no more of them that night. A little before midnight we got &s;afe to my friend's hou&s;e. And ble&s;&s;ed be God, the dear waiting family were looking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and received us with joy. And a precious
<PB N="151" REF="023401_0150_0FBF55E361354050">&s;weet family-meeting we had&punc; I retired to my room as humble as a little child, prai&s;|ing my dear Deliverer.</P>
<P>During the remaining part of the night, though dead in &s;leep, I was tran&s;ported with the vi&s;ions which pa&s;&s;ed through my mind. And had a confidence in the morning, that my beloved Lord would &s;upport me. I &s;aw in the vi&s;ions of the night, many &s;harp and terrible weapons formed again&s;t me; but none could penetrate, or hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e; for as &s;oon as they came near me they were tur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ed into feathers, and bru&s;hed by me as &s;oft as down.</P>
<P>Sunday 27th, at eleven o'clock many came out to hear the word, and it was ex|pected my enemies would be upon me&punc; and I was informed, not a few brought &s;hort clubs under their coats, to defend me in ca&s;e of an attack; for many had ju&s;t about religion enough to fight for it. As I was riving out the hymn, &s;tanding between the hall and room doors, about twenty of my per&s;ec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ors came up in a body (I was amazed to &s;ee one of them, who was an old man, and his head as white as a &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the&s;e were under the appellation of gen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. The ringleader ru&s;hed forward, with
<PB N="152" REF="023401_0151_0FBF55E539E430C0">a pi&s;tol pre&s;ented, and laid hold of me, put|ting the pi&s;tol to my brea&s;t. Ble&s;&s;ed be God! my confidence was &s;o &s;trong in him, that this was with me, as well as all their other weapons, like feathers, as was repre&s;ented to me in the vi&s;ion of the night. Some of the audience, who &s;tood next to me, gave me a &s;udden jerk; I was pre&s;ently in the room, and the door &s;hut. As &s;oon as I could I opened it, and beckoning to my friends, de&s;ired that they would not in|jure my enemies; that I did not want to keep from them, but was willing to go to gaol. If I had not &s;poke in this manner, I believe much blood would have been &s;hed. I began to exhort, and almo&s;t the whole congregation were in tears; and in a par|ticular manner the women were amazingly agitated. I de&s;ired my hor&s;e to be got, and I was accompanied to Cambridge, where I was kept in a tavern from twelve o'clock till near &s;un-&s;et, &s;urrounded by the wick|ed; and it was a great mercy of God that my life was pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>A little before night I was thru&s;t into pri&s;on, and my enemies took away the key, that none might admini&s;ter to my nece&s;&s;i|ties. I had a dirty floor for my bed, my
<PB N="153" REF="023401_0152_0FBF55E6BA192F28">&s;addle-bags for my pillow, and two large windows open with a cold Ea&s;t wind blow|ing upon me: but I had great con&s;olation in my dear Lord, and could &s;ay, "Thy will be done." During my confinement here, I was much drawn out in prayer, reading, writing, and meditation. I believe I had the prayers of my good friend Mr. F. A&s;bury: and the book which he &s;ent me (Mr. Ru|therford's letters during his confinement) together with the &s;oul-comforting and &s;trengthening letters which I received from my pious friends, was rendered a great ble&s;&s;ing to me. The Lord was remarkably good to me, &s;o that I experienced a pri&s;on to be a mere paradi&s;e; and I had a heart to pray for and wi&s;h my wor&s;t enemies well. My &s;oul was &s;o exceedingly happy, I &s;carce knew how my days and nights pa&s;&s;ed away. The bible was never &s;weeter to me. I never had a greater love to God's dear children. I never &s;aw my&s;elf more unworthy. I never &s;aw a greater beauty in the cro&s;s of my dear Lord; for I thought I could, if required, go cheerfully to the &s;take in &s;o good a cau&s;e. I was not at all &s;urpri&s;ed at the cheerfulne&s;s of the anci|ent martyrs, who were able in the flames
<PB N="154" REF="023401_0153_0FBF55E8811E50E0">to clap their glad hands. Sweet moments I had with my dear friends who came to the pri&s;on window.</P>
<Q><L>Happy the man who finds the grace,</L>
<L>The ble&s;&s;ing of God's cho&s;en race,</L>
<L>The wi&s;dom coming from above,</L>
<L>The faith which &s;weetly works by love.</L></Q>
<P>Many, both friends and &s;trangers, came to vi&s;it me from far and near, and I really believe I never was the means of doing more good for the time: for the county &s;eemed to be much alarmed, and the Me|thodi&s;ts among whom I had labored, were much &s;tirred up to pray: for I had written many epi&s;tles to the brethren. I &s;hall ne|ver forget the kindne&s;s I received from dear brother and &s;i&s;ter A. They &s;uffered much for the cau&s;e of God in Dor&s;et county, for which (if faithful) they will be amply com|pen&s;ated in a better world.</P>
<P>My crime of preaching the go&s;pel was &s;o great, that no common court could try my cau&s;e. There appeared to be a proba|bility of my &s;taying in gaol till a general court, which was near twelve months. My good friend Mr. A. went to the governor
<PB N="155" REF="023401_0154_0FBF55F0AC847818">of Maryland, and he befriended me: had I been his brother, he could not have done more for me. The manner in which he proceeded to relieve me was this. I was an inhabitant of Maryland by birth and pro|perty: I could likewi&s;e claim a right in the Delaware &s;tate, which &s;tate was more fa|vorable to &s;uch <HI>pe&s;tilent fellows.</HI> I was carried before the governor of Delaware. This gentleman was a friend to our &s;ocie|ty. He met me at the door, and welcom|ed me in, a&s;&s;uring me he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ould do any thing he could to help me. A recommen|datory letter was immediately di&s;patched to the governor of Maryland, and I was en|tirely at liberty. O! how wonderfully did the people of Dor&s;et rage&mdash;but the word of the Lord &s;pread all through that county, and hundreds, both white and black, have experienced the love of Je&s;us. Since that time I have preached to more than three thou&s;and in one congregation, not far from the place where I was impri&s;oned; and many of my wor&s;t enemies have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">owed to the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eptre of our Sovereign Lord.

<P><PB N="156" REF="023401_0155_0FBF55F2C8D49EC0">
After I le&s;t my confinement, I was more than ever determined to be for God, and none el&s;e. I travelled exten&s;ively, and my dear Lord was with me daily; and my &s;pi|rit did rejoice in God my Saviour. In vi|&s;iting the young &s;ocieties, after I left gaol, we had ble&s;&s;ed hours: for many came to hear&mdash;&s;inners cried for mercy, and God's dear people rejoiced.</P>
<P>Friday 24, was a &s;olemn fa&s;t, being Good-Friday, the day on which my dear Redeemer gave up his precious life. Three days after, being in a ble&s;&s;ed family, I had great &s;weetne&s;s both in public and private; and before I laid down to re&s;t, I was very de&s;irous of being lo&s;t and &s;wallowed up in the love of my dear Redeemer, and of feel|ing the witne&s;s of perfect love. After I laid down to re&s;t, I was in a kind of vi|&s;ionary way for &s;everal hours. About one I awoke very happy, aro&s;e from my bed, and addre&s;&s;ed the throne of grace. I then lighted a candle, and &s;pent near two hours in writing the excrci&s;es of the night. I &s;aw my&s;elf travelling through a di&s;mal place, encompa&s;&s;ed with many dangers; I &s;aw the devil, who appeared very furious; he came near to me and declared with bitterne&s;s,

But in the height of my di&s;tre&s;s, my dear Saviour appeared to me: I thought him the mo&s;t beautiful per&s;on that ever my eyes be|held: "I am your friend," &s;aid he, "and will &s;upport you in your journey; fear not, for your enemy is chained." I &s;eemed to receive much &s;trength, and the power of the enemy was &s;o broken, that he could not move one foot after me: all he could do was to throw out threats, which he did loudly, till I got out of his hearing. Being &s;afe from the&s;e difficulties, I looked for|ward and &s;aw a very high hill which I was to a&s;cend; and began to fear I never &s;hould be able to reach the top: I entered on my journey, and got about half way up, &s;o fa|tig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed that I thought every moment I mu&s;t &s;ink to the earth; I laid down to re&s;t my|&s;elf a little, and &s;eemed to fall into a kind of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;e; but I had not laid long, before the per&s;on who met me in the valley pa&s;&s;ed by, and &s;mote me on the &s;ide, &s;aying&mdash;
<PB N="158" REF="023401_0157_0FBF55F6738F7298">"Ri&s;e up, and be gone, there is no re&s;t for you there." With that I received &s;trength, and got up to the top of the hill. I then looked back, and &s;aw my enemy at a great di&s;tance: I was greatly &s;urprized when I &s;aw the place through which I had come; for on every hand there appeared to be pits, holes, and quagmires in abun|dance. I was much wounded, and all be|&s;pattered with dirt, but looked round to &s;ee if I could find any hou&s;e; and at a di&s;tance I e&s;pied a little cottage, and made up to it: when I got near the door, two angels met me and &s;aid, "Come in, come in, thou ble&s;&s;ed of the Lord, here is entertainment for weary travellers." I thought within ap|peared to be the mo&s;t beautiful place I had ever &s;een. After I went in, I thought it was heaven filled with ble&s;&s;ed &s;aints and angels. One and another broke out "Glo|ry, glory," &amp;c. &amp;c. till the place was fil|led with prai&s;es. One &s;pake to me and &s;aid, "This is not heaven, as you &s;uppo&s;e, neither are we angels, but &s;anctified Chri&s;|tians; and this is the &s;econd re&s;t. And it is your privilege, and the privilege of all the children of God." With that I thought I had faith to believe, and in a moment my

<P>Before this, I had an ardent de&s;ire tru|ly to know my &s;tate, and to &s;ink deep into God. When I awoke I &s;eemed all taken up with divine things; and &s;pent part of the remainder of the night in writing, prayer, and prai&s;es: and had a &s;trong wit|ne&s;s of union with my dear Lord. My brother T. from Baltimore &s;ide came to &s;ee me, and travelled &s;everal weeks with me: and ble&s;&s;ed times we had together; for I believe it was on this vi&s;it he felt a witne&s;s of pardoning love to his &s;oul.</P>
<P>Upon a certain occa&s;ion, I was wonder|fully led to think of the place called hell, and was &s;everely ba&s;&s;eted by the devil. "Hell," &s;aid he, <Q>is not &s;o bad a place as you repre&s;ent it: how can God be a merciful Being, as you &s;et him forth, if he &s;ends people to &s;uch a di&s;mal place for a few &s;ins, to be tormented for ever?</Q> I was earne&s;tly de&s;irous to know what kind of place it was. And the Lord conde&s;cended to &s;atisfy me in the dead &s;ea|&s;on of the night. After I feil into a deep
<PB N="160" REF="023401_0159_0FBF55FE77136550">&s;leep, I &s;eemed to enter through a narrow gate into eternity; and was met by a per|&s;on who conducted me to the place called hell; but I had a very imperfect view of it; I reque&s;ted to be taken where I could &s;ee it better, if that could be done: I was then conveyed to a &s;pot where I had a full view of it. It appeared as large as the &s;ea, and I &s;aw myriads of damned &s;ouls, in every po&s;ture that mi&s;erable beings could get in|to. This &s;ight exceeded any thing of the kind that ever had entered into my mind. But it was not for me to know any of them. Was I to attempt to de&s;cribe the place as it was repre&s;ented to me, I could not do it. Had I the pen of a ready writer, and an|gelic wi&s;dom, I &s;hould fall &s;hort. I cried out to my guide, it is enough. With that he brought me to the place where he fir&s;t met me. I then de&s;ired a di&s;covery of hea|ven: my g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;aid, "not now; return: you have &s;een &s;ufficient for once; and be more faithful in warning &s;inners, and have no more doubts about the reality of hell." Then I in&s;tantly awoke.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION VIII. <HI>A &s;hort Account of my Labors and Exerci&s;es on the We&s;tern-Shore in the Year</HI> 1780.</HEAD>
<P>THE Methodi&s;ts being only a &s;ociety, who were mo&s;tly united (with re|&s;pect to communion) to the Church of England; and her mini&s;ters (e&s;pecially in Virginia and Carolina) in the time of the war were di&s;per&s;ed, &s;o that a large body of people, under the name of Methodi&s;ts, were in a great mea&s;ure de&s;titute of the ordinances of the Lord's hou&s;e. In this ca&s;e what was to be done? Our dear Vir|ginia brethren thought it expedient to form them&s;elves into a church, and have the or|dinances among them; which they did in the year 1779. But it was contrary to the minds of the preachers to the North.</P>
<P>In April 1780, we held a conference in Baltimore; at which brother F. A. bro|ther W. W. and my&s;elf thought proper to vi&s;it our brethren at the South: and after a tedious journey of &s;everal hundred miles, we arrived &s;afe in Manekin-town: where we found the brethren in conference, fully
<PB N="162" REF="023401_0161_0FBF5601405864E8">per&s;uaded in their minds that the Lord re|quired us to be a &s;eparate church. We for a con&s;iderable time conferred together, and much of the divine pre&s;ence was a|mong us. On both &s;ides it was painful to part. This the great Governor of the church would not permit; for when the help of man failed, he interpo&s;ed his om|nipotent arm, and convinced our brethren, that they ought at lea&s;t to accede to a &s;u&s;|pen&s;ion of the ordinances for one year, till the founder of our &s;ociety, Mr. John We&s;|ley, could be con&s;ulted. A circum&s;tantial letter was written to that venerable apo&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the age, which moved his bowels of compa&s;&s;ion towards us; and he was fully convinced, &s;ome time after, that he was in duty bound, for the pro&s;perity of the con|nection in America, to do that thing, which he once but little expected&mdash;I &s;peak with re&s;pect to his &s;ending over a power of ordination, with his approbation of our becoming a &s;eparate, tho' Epi&s;copal church. Which he did as &s;oon as the way was open: and it has proved the ri&s;ing glory of the connection.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day May 11, having accompli&s;hed our bu&s;ine&s;s and obtained our wi&s;hes, we
<PB N="163" REF="023401_0162_0FBF560969416AA8">&s;et our faces to the North with gladne&s;s of heart, prai&s;ing the Lord for his great good|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day 18, I came to Baltimore, where I was appointed to labor.</P>
<P>Friday 19, I &s;et apart as a day of fa&s;t|ing, and felt my &s;oul &s;weetly united to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. I vi&s;ited brother W. L&mdash;'s family, and had great fellow&s;hip with them. Surely &s;i&s;ter L. po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the per|fect love of God.</P>
<P>Saturday 20, I awoke a little after four o'clock, very much taken up with my dear Redeemer. The company and conver&s;a|tion of God's dear children, are ble&s;&s;ings for which I &s;hall never be &s;ufficiently thankful. I have had many &s;weet moments with this dear family. I returned to town, and preached with freedom.</P>
<P>Sunday 21. As the &s;erpent was lifted up in the wilderne&s;s, &s;o did I endeavour to hold up the Saviour of the world to a li&s;t|ening multitude at the Point-chapel. I at|tended the Engli&s;h church, and heard my old pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;h mini&s;ter Mr. W. and he deliver|ed a good moral &s;ermon.

My trials are great, but I am borne above the world and &s;in.</P>
<P>Monday 22. I was comfortable whil&s;t exhibiting the truth to a loving people; and the day following I attended a funeral, and found great freedom to preach. The remaining part of the week, I was com|fortably employed in preaching, vi&s;iting our pious friends, and meeting cla&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Sunday 27. I held forth in Gunpowder|neck to many hearers. This is almo&s;t as old a &s;ociety as any in Maryland: it is about 12 miles from where I was born. In the evening I preached to a &s;tiff-necked peo|ple; but I believe &s;ome good was done.&mdash; This week was chiefly taken up among my relations and old acquaintances, who are mo&s;tly laying in the arms of the evil one; neverthele&s;s I found freedom, by day and night, to offer Je&s;us to them.</P>
<P>Sunday June 3. With delight I viewed the ri&s;ing morn; the fields were clad with
<PB N="165" REF="023401_0164_0FBF560D08867308">a beautiful green; the creation &s;miling, and the birds tuning their notes&mdash;&s;urely an immortal &s;pirit ought to prai&s;e the Creator of the univer&s;e. Many attended my mi|ni&s;try in our old Bu&s;h-chapel, among whom were many of my relations and old com|panions, &s;ome of whom came a di&s;tance. I found freedom, 1. to point out the beau|ty, 2. the order, 3. the &s;trength, 4. the pri|vileges of the church; and la&s;tly, gave an affectionate addre&s;s, particularly to parents, to tell it to the generations following.&mdash; P&s;alms xlviii. 12, 13. I had rea&s;on to be|lieve the hearts of &s;ome were &s;oftened, and &s;ome of my relations and old acquaintances began to think that I was not be&s;ide my|&s;elf. I cried the &s;ame day to many preci|ous &s;ouls, <HI>Cut it down, why cumbereth it the ground?</HI> Luke xiii. 6&mdash;9. The week fol|lowing temporal bu&s;ine&s;s &s;omewhat inter|fered with my &s;piritual concerns; but I tru&s;t the one thing needful was not neglected.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day 5th, eight hours pa&s;&s;ed &s;weetly away in clo&s;et-exerci&s;es. I want to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> deep into the &s;pirit of holine&s;s.

<P>Sunday 10. At the Fork-chapel I found freedom to hold out the willingne&s;s of Chri&s;t to &s;ave all who unfeignedly devote them&s;elves to him: and afterwards Mr. G. gave a lively exhortation to the Chri&s;tians to &s;tand fa&s;t in the faith: but I fear &s;ome who were pre&s;ent, have turned a&s;ide. In the afternoon I preached at his hou&s;e&mdash; from, <HI>Fear not, little flock, for it is your Fa|ther's good plea&s;ure to give you the kingdom,</HI> Luke xii. 32. 1. Who are the flock? 2. Why &s;mall? 3. What fears are they trou|bled with? and then concluded with an affectionate addre&s;s. I felt a &s;weetne&s;s in my own &s;oul, and &s;everal thought it good to be there.</P>
<P>Sunday June 17, I preached two &s;er|mons: the fir&s;t in a private hou&s;e, and the &s;econd in the Dutch church at Ri&s;ter-Town. Part of my retired hours was tak|en up the week following, in the &s;tudy of the Revelation. This book is not to be under&s;tood but by the &s;ame &s;pirit with which it was written. It was not written without tears; with tears we mu&s;t &s;it at the feet of Je&s;us for an under&s;tanding of it.

<P>Thur&s;day 21, was a very dull day to me, e&s;pecially the former part of it.</P>
<P>Sunday 24, was a day of gladne&s;s, and I preached with freedom. Monday I met brother W. and brother T. I preached with freedom, and one &s;oul was &s;et at li|berty. Tue&s;day morning was a refre&s;hing time to me. I am happy in vi&s;iting the &s;ick: it is a mo&s;t comfortable thing to have an intere&s;t in heaven on a dying pillow.</P>
<P>Sunday July 2. I have again returne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to Baltimore-Town, and have great fellow|&s;hip with the dear di&s;ciples of our Lord in this place; and the word is &s;weet to many.

The Chri&s;tians were all alive, and &s;inners crying aloud for mercy; &s;o that my voice was almo&s;t lo&s;t. When I departed, I left one youth, who had been very wicked, &s;truggling as for life, and his companions weeping around him. I know not how many were &s;et at liberty; I felt the power of faith, and returned to town, where I preached with freedom to near a thou&s;and people. The next day in the country, whil&s;t I was, fir&s;t, de&s;cribing who we are to under&s;tand by the king's daugh|ter, and &s;econdly, in what &s;en&s;e &s;he is all glorious within; one &s;oul was new-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>

<P>Monday 17, having been &s;ent for, I vi|&s;ited aunt B. my father's &s;i&s;ter, a very old woman; and &s;he appeared to be near her end. I know not how many years &s;he had been a communicant in the Epi&s;copal church; but all this will not avail, if we do not become new creatures. My father had eleven brothers and &s;i&s;ters, the mo&s;t of whom lived to be old. They are all gone to a world of &s;pirits except one, and &s;he is on the borders of the grave. My heart melted within me. After prayer I left her, and &s;he appeared to have a tender heart.</P>
<P>Sunday 23. The worth of precious &s;ouls lays with weight upon me. O! for a trum|pet voice, on all the world to call! After preaching at the Fork-chapel, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> had a comfortable love-fea&s;t; and at Mr. G.'s we had a profitable watch-night.</P>

Sunday 30, brother C. and family ac|companied me. At &s;even o'clock we had a love-fea&s;t; about two hundred of our bre|thren were pre&s;ent, and our Saviour was in the mid&s;t. Afterwards I preached in the Dutch church. About thirty of our friends accompanied me about eight miles to ano|ther Dutch church, where I preached to many with freedom. Many went with me three miles further to Mr. V.'s, where we had a watch-night. The labors of this day were weari&s;ome to the body; but I was &s;trong in faith, and willing to give my little all to God. The next day a crowded audience a&s;&s;embled at the &s;ame place: &s;ome time before, and whil&s;t the people were gathering, my mind was uncommonly ex|erci&s;ed: but I found great freedom whil&s;t inforcing, <HI>Think it not &s;trange concerning the fiery trial, which is to try you, as though &s;ome &s;trange thing happened unto you.</HI> The cloud was di&s;per&s;ed, and I felt my&s;elf un|commonly &s;weet and comfortable.

<PB N="174" REF="023401_0173_0FBF56278E1CD6B8">his arm bare, and we had a precious, refre&s;hing &s;hower; and the heart of my dear old uncle was tendered<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and tears flowed down his face. After he left the Chapel, he &s;aid to &s;ome of his acquain|tances, "&s;urely my cou&s;in is belied." He came and begged me to go home with him; which I did. The next day he fol|lowed me five miles; and the tears flowed plentifully. When we were about to part, he a&s;ked me what compen&s;ation he &s;hould make me for the benefit which he had re|ceived. "Will you," &s;aid he, "receive a &s;uit of clothes?" I thanked him kindly, telling him that I had as much clothing as was nece&s;&s;ary. He then put his hand in his pocket, and pulled out eighty conti|nental dollars, which at that time were worth about twenty hard dollars; at fir&s;t I refu&s;ed; but he would not be denied. So I took them, and &s;ome time after gave them to brother S. a man who needed them. When we parted, he told me he expected to &s;ee me no more&mdash;It was &s;o; for &s;ome time af|ter the Lord called him away.</P>
<P>I continued in this circuit till the follow|ing &s;pring, and enjoyed precious moments. Many were added to the &s;ociety, and many
<PB N="175" REF="023401_0174_0FBF5629C97B8168">brought into go&s;pel-liberty: and &s;ome re|ceived the &s;econd ble&s;&s;ing.

<HEAD>SECTION IX. <HI>An Account of my Travels, Exerci&s;es, and Succe&s;s, in forming what is called Little York Circuit.</HI></HEAD>
<P>FOR &s;ome time it was in my mind to vi&s;it Little York, and the country round. The way being open, on Monday the 24th of January 1781, I &s;et out, and travelled till evening: and then put up at a tavern, about twelve miles from the town to which I was bound. I lectured in the family on the &s;eventh of Matthew; and the Lord began <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s work: that night Mr. W. a gentleman from the town, lodged at the &s;ame tavern; and in time of family-wor|&s;hip,
<PB N="176" REF="023401_0175_0FBF56319C0FE238">the Lord, in mercy, laid his hand of conviction on him.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day 25th, I went on to town, and in the afternoon the bell rang, and I preach|ed in the Dutch church; and the gentle|man's lady (who was awakened the even|ing before) got her heart touched. When he came home in the evening, he &s;poke to this effect, "My dear, I heard &s;uch a man la&s;t night as I never &s;aw or heard before, and if what he &s;aid be true, we are all in the way to hell." "I expect," &s;aid &s;he, "he is the &s;ame man whom I heard this afternoon in Wagoner's church; and I be|lieve that his doctrine is true, and that we are all in the way to ruin." "Well," &s;aid he, "let us &s;et about our &s;alvation." "I am willing," &s;aid &s;he.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day 26th. As I had &s;ent forward an appointment, I went on about twenty miles, and preached with a degree of free|dom.</P>
<P>Having an appointment, I preached at Mr. G.'s, the Lutheran mini&s;ter; and after meeting we had an agreeable conver&s;ation. His mother and &s;i&s;ter, who&s;e hearts the Lord had touched. accompanied me to Berlin, where I preached to a large con|gregation
<PB N="177" REF="023401_0176_0FBF563281723958">with great freedom. I again had an opportunity, in the evening, to hold up a loving Saviour to the li&s;tening multitude.</P>
<P>By this time a per&s;ecution had ari&s;en among the people in Little York and around: the enemy of &s;ouls had taken an advantage of my two friends, who were awakened: being under deep di&s;tre&s;s, and &s;orely tempted by the devil, not knowing what to do, at length they prepared water, and wa&s;hed them&s;elves; and then put on clean clothes, and concluded that it was the new birth. And after they came from their room, they ki&s;&s;ed their two children, who were man and woman well nigh grown, and told them they were new born. Being in a great mea&s;ure bereft of their &s;en&s;es, and the enemy ready to take every advantage, "Come," &s;aid they, "old things mu&s;t be done away, and all things mu&s;t become new." They then began to throw their old clothing and blankets <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the fire; and among other things he throw on a large bundle of paper money. "This," &s;aid he, "is an old thing, and mu&s;t be done away." The neighbours being alarm|ed, ran in and &s;aved many things: but I
<PB N="178" REF="023401_0177_0FBF5633F53E5B18">&s;uppo&s;e they did not &s;u&s;tain le&s;s than fifteen pounds lo&s;s. A mini&s;ter was &s;ent for, and he de&s;ired a doctor to be called; for they knew not what was the matter. A Quak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> woman came to &s;ee them, and &s;he &s;aid, "She did not know of any one that could be of &s;ervice to them, unle&s;s it was the man that was the occa&s;ion of it." The cry was, &s;uch a man ought not to go through the country: and others de&s;ired me to be brought and put into gaol. I was about twenty miles off, and as &s;oon as I heard of it, mounted my hor&s;e and got to them as quick as po&s;&s;ible. When the neighbours &s;aw me, &s;everal gathered into the room. When I entered the hou&s;e, I perceived that the woman looked &s;trange, and the man was in bed under the hands of the doctor, with &s;everal bli&s;ter-plai&s;ters on him. I &s;at down by his bed&s;ide (&s;he &s;at on the foot of the bed) and a&s;ked him what he wanted&mdash;"To be new born," &s;aid he. Taking out my little bible, I read and lectured on a chap|ter: and &s;en&s;ibly felt that the Lord was pre&s;ent to hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.

I de&s;ired them to take his bli&s;ter-plai&s;ters off. Glory to God! he re&s;tored them, not only to their natural, but &s;piritual &s;en&s;es. A good and gracious God has his own way of working among the children of men. Though at fir&s;t it cau&s;ed a great di&s;tre&s;s to lay upon my mind; yet in the end it was for good; many were a&s;toni&s;hed and brought to a &s;erious con&s;ideration. Although the church door was &s;hut again&s;t me, a large &s;chool, room was opened, in which I preached a &s;ermon on the occa&s;ion, to about three hundred &s;ouls; and the Lord touched the hearts of many: and my two mad people (as they had been called) were able to re|joice in the Lord: and it was not long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> I gathered a loving &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day 15th, I preached in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> G.'s church, to almo&s;t as many as it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> hold, from, <HI>If the rightous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;aved,</HI> &amp;c.

In the evening I preach|ed to many in the mini&s;ter's own hou&s;e, and there was an inquiry how to obtain mercy. In the country Satan began to rage as well as in town. The people be|gan to cry out again&s;t their mini&s;ter, be|cau&s;e (as they expre&s;&s;ed it) I had turned him to be a M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">thodi&s;t.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day 22. I had a tedious journey to Colche&s;ter; but found the parents of one family (who were awakened when I was there before) mourning for Je&s;us; and I had freedom to preach to the people. In the morning I &s;et out again for Berlin, and mi&s;&s;ed my way. I am burdened&mdash;&s;urely it is a burden which the Lord hath laid up|on me, and it is for the be&s;t. I called at an hou&s;e to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> for the road&mdash;I heard a di&s;mal groaning and lamenting within. I alighted from my hor&s;e and went in; and fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the woman of the hou&s;e wringing her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ands, and mourning bitterly. Good woman, &s;aid I, what is the matter with you? "Sir," &s;aid &s;he, "have you never heard what has happened? I have &s;old my three little children to the devil, and &s;uch a

I read and explained <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> her parts of &s;everal chapters; but it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">emed all in vain. Her hu&s;band came in, and I de&s;ired him to get a hor&s;e and take her to preaching that afternoon. After he had got the hor&s;e, I de&s;ired her to make ready, and go to preaching with her hu&s;band. "O," &s;aid &s;he, "I cannot think of leaving my dear little children in the arms of the devil." After &s;ome time &s;he was prevailed on to go. Her hu&s;band told me, that &s;he had carried a razor in her bo&s;om for three weeks, with an intent, fir&s;t to take the lives of her children (be|fore the day came, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> thought the devil was to come for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> and then take her own life.

She became a ble&s;&s;ed, pious woman. I then knew the cau&s;e of my being lo&s;t. O God, thou art good,
<PB N="182" REF="023401_0181_0FBF56402CF8DCF8">and I will prai&s;e thee! thou art kind, and I will give glory to thy holy name!</P>
<P>Friday February 24, I returned to town, and the per&s;ecution was &s;o hot, that I thought it mo&s;t expedient to preach at Mr. W.'s, a mile out of town. Many gather|ed, and we had a moving time. The next day we had a powerful &s;ea&s;on; and the hearts of &s;ome of my enemies were reach|ed.</P>
<P>Sunday February 26. I never &s;aw &s;o many out in this place before, and even &s;ome who had thought it a &s;in to hear me. And I never &s;aw a more general moving in any place where preaching had been &s;o &s;hort a time. In this county there were, I think, &s;ixteen different denominations, and &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;eemed zealous in their way. In the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">noon I again returned and preached <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> W.'s, where one wo|man was &s;truck under conviction, and cri|ed aloud for mercy.

<P>Wedne&s;day February 28, I returned to try the town again, and found the people very &s;till; and we had a &s;olemn, u&s;eful
<PB N="183" REF="023401_0182_0FBF564256C85238">time. Lodged at Mr. S.'s, and felt my &s;pirit much refre&s;hed.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day March 1. Being de&s;ired the day before to vi&s;it a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed man, one who was troubled with an evil &s;pirit; be|tween day-break and &s;unri&s;e, I called his mini&s;ter out of bed, and de&s;ired him to go with me. We went, and I de&s;ired all to leave the room, except the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed man, his wife, the mini&s;ter, and my&s;elf. I then de&s;ired him to open to me his ca&s;e. He &s;aid "for a long time the devil had followed him, and that he had frequently &s;een him with his bodily eyes." The dear man was under conviction, but knew not what was the matter with him. I told him my experience, and gave him as good directions as I was capable of. I prayed for him, and &s;o likewi&s;e did his mini&s;ter in Dutch; and I under&s;tood afterward, that he was troubled no more in the &s;ame way, and became one of my quiet hear|ers.</P>
<P>I vi&s;ited the country, and experienced great di&s;plays of the awakening power of God; for many precious &s;ouls were en|quiring the way to heaven, both Dutch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Engli&s;h. I again returned to town,
<PB N="184" REF="023401_0183_0FBF5645F136D0E0">and preached to about three hundred peo|ple by candle-light; but &s;ome were offend|ed. I appointed to preach the next even|ing. In town there were many &s;oldiers billeted, and the officers declared that if I came to attempt to preach again, that they would have me to gao!&mdash;So I under&s;tood by my friends; who de&s;ired me to decline. I was not afraid of their threats, but in the evening attended the appointment. Shortly after I had taken my text&mdash;<HI>Quench not the Spirit,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> The&s;&s;alonians v. 19. &s;eve|ral officers with a company of &s;oldiers came to the place, but the hou&s;e was &s;o crowded, none could get in but the offi|cers, who fixed them&s;elves by my right-hand; one of whom &s;tood on a bench with his &s;taff in his hand, li&s;ted up &s;everal times either to &s;trike or &s;care me; but had a bat or an owl lighted on the wail, I &s;hould have been as much afraid.

<P>Saturday 20, I preached at Mr. H. P.'s, and the Lutheran mini&s;ter who met me, gave an exhortation after I had done, in Dutch.</P>
<P>Sunday 21, I preached at the &s;ame place at eight o'clock to hundreds. I then rode five miles, and preached in a large barn at twelve o'clock, but many could not get in. More than a hundred followed me from the morning preaching, and many of them were crying for mercy. One man came to me in a flood of tears&mdash;"Sir," &s;aid he, "can you tell me what I &s;hall do to be &s;aved, for I am the wickede&s;t man in the whole county." I exhorted him to put his tru&s;t and confidence in God. The gene|ral cry among the people was, "This is the right religion."&mdash;It did appear to me, as if &s;ects, and names, and parties would fall; and only the name of Chri&s;t be all in all. I rode &s;ix miles farther followed by many, and preached with freedom at four o'clock. And in the evening I had great freedom to preach in town. It would be too tedious for me to give an account of every particular; yea, I could not do it.

<HEAD>SECTION X. <HI>A &s;hort Account of my Travels till the fol|lowing Conference,</HI> 1781.</HEAD>
<P>OUR conference was attended with a ble&s;&s;ing. All the travelling-preachers were willing to abide by Mr. We&s;ley's judg|ment, re&s;pecting the ordinances. I was appointed to Su&s;&s;ex circuit in Virginia: but found it to be &s;omewhat difficult to travel; for it was the time when Cornwallis was ran&s;acking the country. In Virginia it was a time of di&s;tre&s;s indeed, and there was a call for great faith and patience.</P>
<P>June 4th, 1781, I got into the circuit, and had an appointment at Ellis's chapel. When I entered the door I &s;aw a man in the pulpit dre&s;&s;ed in black, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e was at prayer. I &s;oon perceived her was a man bereft of his rea&s;on. I went into the pul|pit and de&s;ired him to give over. After he ended, I gave out his text, and began to preach. But I had no other way to &s;top him, than to de&s;ire the people to with|draw. His te&s;timony was, that he was a prophet &s;ent of God to teach the people;
<PB N="188" REF="023401_0187_0FBF565084CF81A0">and that it was revealed to him, a per&s;on was to interrupt him in his di&s;cour&s;e. Af|ter a few minutes the people returned, and all was &s;till. I then gave out, <HI>Feed my &s;heep,</HI> John xxi. 17. I had liberty in &s;hew|ing, 1. the character in the text&mdash;&s;heep; 2. why the followers of our Lord might be called &s;heep; and, 3. how the &s;heep are to be fed. 1. The &s;hepherd; 2. the food; and, 3. the manner of feeding the flock. The prophet returned home, and that night he told his family, at &s;uch an hour he would go into a trance; and that they mu&s;t not bury him till after &s;uch a time, &s;hould he not come to. Accordingly, to appearance he was in a trance. The next day I was &s;ent for to vi&s;it him. Many were weeping around the bed. He lay like a corp&s;e, for I could not perceive that he breathed. He was once happy in God, and a &s;en&s;ible, u&s;eful man. About the time of which he &s;poke, he came to him|&s;elf. Satan was partly di&s;appointed; for in a mea&s;ure he was re&s;tored to his rea&s;on, and I took him part of the way round the circuit with me. What was the cau&s;e of this? Satan prompted him to think more highly of him&s;elf than he ought; and to
<PB N="189" REF="023401_0188_0FBF5658C826F9A0">&s;et him&s;elf up for &s;ome great one; and &s;o he fell into the condemnation of the devil. I had a hope before we parted, his fallen &s;oul was re&s;tored; and &s;ome time after he began again to preach Chri&s;t; and, I tru&s;t, was more humble than ever. I continued on this circuit about three months, and had many happy hours, and &s;ome di&s;tre&s;&s;|ing ones. Two things cau&s;ed a great di&s;|tre&s;s on my mind, 1. the &s;pirit of fight|ing; and, 2. that of &s;lavery which ran among the people. I was re&s;olved to be found in my duty, and keep back no part of the coun&s;el of God. Day and night I could hear the &s;oaring of the cannon, for I was not far from York, during the &s;iege or taking of Cornwallis. Many of our pi|ous friends were ab&s;olutely again&s;t fight|ing, and &s;ome of them &s;uffered much on that account. Some of them were com|pelled or taken by force into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e field; though they would &s;ooner lo&s;e their own lives, than take the life of any human creature. I &s;aw it my duty to cry <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">own this kind of proceeding, declaring that it was not precedented (to compel per&s;ons to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ght contrary to their con&s;ciences) in the oracles of God. I was, in a particular
<PB N="190" REF="023401_0189_0FBF565A48B9CF78">manner, led to preach again&s;t the practice of &s;lave-holding. Several were convinced of the impiety of the practice, and libe|rated their &s;laves; and many others, who did not liberate them, were convinced that they ought to u&s;e them better than they had done. Had it not been for tho&s;e two evils which lay &s;o heavy on me, I might have been more popular among the people. I preached at a quarterly meeting at Maber|ry's chapel, where there were about two thou&s;and pre&s;ent, of all ranks; and being pre&s;&s;ed in &s;pirit, I cried, <HI>Do ju&s;tice, love mercy, and walk humbly with thy God.</HI> There were more than a thou&s;and people who could not get into the chapel: &s;ome of tho&s;e without called for an officer to take me. After meeting was ended, I walked through the mid&s;t of them, but no one laid hands on me. During my &s;tay in this circuit, many back&s;liders were reclaim|ed, and though my trials were great, I had many refre&s;hing &s;ea&s;ons.</P>
<P>Saturday and Sunday Augu&s;t 12 and 13, I attended a quarterly meeting in Nan&s;e|mond circuit; and travell d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">everal times round it, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a great love for the people. Mrs. G. (a woman of note) and
<PB N="191" REF="023401_0190_0FBF565BB3E556E0">her niece, came out to hear the word; both were convinced, and became famous for piety.</P>
<P>Friday 25, I preached near a place call|ed the De&s;ert. I am informed that this wilderne&s;s is twenty miles broad, and fifty long; and in the middle of it is a lake three miles wide and five long; in which is abundance of fi&s;h of various kinds. I am al&s;o informed, that when the Indians were driven from this part of Carolina, many of them fled to this de&s;ert, in which they found a &s;mall &s;pot of high land, where they lived mo&s;tly on roots and fi&s;h, till they were driven out by the wild bea&s;ts of the de&s;ert. I am farther informed that it is inhabited by panthers, bears, wolves, and wild cats in abundance: and that they are of a very large &s;ize.</P>
<P>I am now in my element&mdash;forming a new circuit&mdash;and I have plea&s;ing pro&s;pects. I preached in one peace, and there was a great &s;haking among the people. I preach|ed again the next day, and the power of the Lord in a mo&s;t wonderful manner came down.&mdash;I was &s;omewhat &s;urprized&mdash; the rich are brought to mourn for Chri&s;t.

A large &s;ociety was united in this place, mo&s;tly of the rich. About this time I received a letter from Mr. F. A. in which I was informed that he could not vi&s;it the &s;outh, and that it was his de&s;ire I &s;hould &s;ee to &s;tationing the preachers.</P>
<P>In November I began my autumn vi&s;ita|tion. Saturday and Sunday 3d and 4th, the Brun&s;wick quarterly meeting was held; at which about twelve preachers met, and had their different appointments. We had a ble&s;&s;ed time at this meeting. I travelled (by the de&s;ire of the brethren) largely through the circuits, and my dear Lord was powerfully pre&s;ent in many places to heal. I met with much trouble from &s;eve|ral who were not willing to give up the admini&s;tration of the ordinances.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day January 29, I unexpectedly met Mr. F. A. (as he had concluded it was be&s;t to come down) who reque&s;ted me to vi&s;it the circuits on the north &s;ide of James ri|ver; which I promi&s;ed to do, as &s;oon as I had fulfilled my appointments already made. I did not accompli&s;h this till the mouth of
<PB N="193" REF="023401_0192_0FBF56650E180C28">March, for I had to vi&s;it my new circuit, where I had crowds to hear the word; and &s;everal of the Engli&s;h churches were open; and many enquiring after eternal life.</P>
<P>March 14. Having fini&s;hed my rout, I cro&s;&s;ed James river, and entered Fluvannah circuit: and felt my heart clo&s;ely united with the dear children of God, &s;ome of whom have emancipated their &s;laves. I found them in great confu&s;ion about the ordinances at the Brokenback church, and favorably hope that my vi&s;it was for good, for I was greatly drawn out in preaching the word.</P>
<P>Saturday 23 and Sunday 24th, I attend|ed my brother Richard Garrett&s;on's quar|terly meeting; and we both had great free|dom to preach the word, and a precious, powerful time. This meeting was held at colonel F.'s, a mo&s;t precious man; one who &s;peaks boldly for his ma&s;ter, and has liberated many &s;laves. My brother travel|led &s;everal days with me, and we had &s;weet times together.</P>
<P>Saturday 30th of March, I travelled on my way to Hanover circuit, and had &s;ome very agreeable conver&s;ation with a ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|man on the road, who appeared to be de|&s;irous
<PB N="194" REF="023401_0193_0FBF566703F37980">of &s;alvation; though at fir&s;t very unwilling to let it be known.</P>
<P>Sunday 31, I preached in the Pre&s;byte|rian meeting-hou&s;e at Ground-Squirrel; but I do not know of any good done, ex|cept prejudice removed. I pa&s;t round the circuit, preaching day and night with a degree of &s;ucce&s;s, and my &s;pirit was daily refre&s;hed.</P>
<P>Sunday 5, I preached in the church in King and Queen. We had &s;uch a &s;hout in the camp of I&s;rael, that my voice was lo&s;t. Saturday we had a powerful meeting at dear brother S.'s. The good old man told me, it was revealed to him &s;everal months before, that I &s;hould preach in his hou&s;e. (I have heard much of you, &s;aid he, and have had a longing de&s;ire to &s;ee you.) I perceived that the Lord had ble&s;t my brother Richard's labors in this place. I &s;et &s;everal days apart for retirement, and earne&s;tly de&s;ired to drink more deeply into the Spirit of God. O, for a clo&s;er walk with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> heavenly Friend! It is not enough for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to preach to others, I need food daily for my own &s;oul. Lord, give me a con&s;tant hungering and thir&s;ting after thee.</P>

Saturday 11, as I was on my way to my appointment, my chai&s;e turned over, and the hor&s;e being &s;cared, broke the chai&s;e and harne&s;s, &s;o that I was under a nece&s;&s;i|ty of borrowing a hor&s;e and &s;addle. The next day I preached in the church, and my chai&s;e being fitted up, I &s;et out on my way, accompanied by brother D. We rode all day through the rain, and on Wedne&s;day we got to Surry, where con|ference was to be held. My reward is not with man: if it was I &s;hould be poorly off. We &s;ettled our conference concerns as far as we could, and adjourned till the third Tue&s;day in May: when it was to be con|cluded in Baltimore. On Sunday I at|tended the quarterly meeting in Su&s;&s;ex with Mr. F. A. When I came to Lee&s;|burgh I found the &s;mall-pox very brief; and when I got into Baltimore-Town it was more &s;o; and my &s;cruples being re|moved, I was inoculated; for which I have had no rea&s;on to repent. My labors in Virginia the pa&s;t year were not altogether in vain. I think my dear Lord made me in&s;trumental in uniting to us many of our brethren, who had di&s;agreed with us about the ordinances, both preachers and people.

<P>MY time was mo&s;tly &s;pent in the Pe|nin&s;ula; and glorious di&s;plays of the goodne&s;s of God we had. I never &s;aw a greater meeting than we had at Barrot's chapel, in the fall. It was the de&s;ire of bro|ther F. A. that I &s;hould go to Red&s;tone, in order to form &s;ome circuits there. I was willing to go in the &s;pring, but I felt an unwillingne&s;s to expo&s;e my&s;elf in the dead of winter, in the back &s;ettlements, where all were &s;trangers to our doctrine and di&s;ci|pline. I never was able to determine, whe|ther I was right or wrong in refu&s;ing to go at that &s;ea&s;on. However, I &s;uffered much in my mind, wi&s;hing many times afterward that I had taken up the cro&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="023401_0196_0FBF5671CB366068">
In Augu&s;t 1784, I received a letter from brother F. A. in which I was de&s;ired to prepare for a journey to Charle&s;ton, as quick as po&s;&s;ible. At that time I was tra|velling in Talbot circuit, and had great freedom among the people. Our dear Lord was laying a foundation for, and carrying on a mo&s;t glorious work. I have no doubt but hundreds were awakened that &s;ummer, in the circuit. Dear brother M. (who was called the weeping prophet) travelled with me; and the Lord owned his labors. The mo&s;t of my time, during this &s;tation, was &s;pent in Kent, Su&s;&s;ex, and Talbot circuits; where we had glorious gatherings to the &s;ociety. It was not uncommon to &s;ee from one to four thou&s;and people at a quarterly meeting; and I was ready to conclude, that the whole Penin&s;ula would flame with the glory of God. I was re&s;olved, by the ble&s;|&s;ing of the Lord, to leave the circuit as quick as po&s;&s;ible, and &s;et out on my jour|ney to Charle&s;ton, which I did after the Tuckehoe quarterly meeting, at which I preached my farewell &s;ermon to a name|ous crowd bathed in tears. I went as far as Dover, and intended to &s;tay at R. B.'s. <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> a few days. The evening following
<PB N="198" REF="023401_0197_0FBF5673C300E7D8">a friend came to my room, and informed me that doctor Coke had arrived, and was below. I went down, and received him and brother W. as welcome me&s;&s;engers; and accompanied them the next day to a quarterly meeting held at Barrot's chapel. Dear Mr. We&s;ley had gratified the de&s;ires of thou&s;ands of his friends in America, in &s;ending a power of ordination, and giving his con&s;ent to our becoming a &s;eparate church. About fifteen preachers were pre|&s;ent; and it was concluded that I &s;hould go through the continent, and call a con|ference at Baltimore immediately. With|in &s;ix weeks, after travelling upwards of twelve hundred miles, I &s;ettled the bu&s;ine&s;s, be&s;ides preaching almo&s;t every day, once, and &s;ometimes twice, and made my return. The preachers being gathered, our confer|ence began on Chri&s;tmas-day, and we ac|ceded to the method propo&s;ed by Mr. We&s;|ley: and men were &s;et apart, and con&s;e|crated for the different orders of the church. And in&s;tead of Charle&s;ton, I had an ap|pointment to take charge of the work in the Ea&s;t. I was tempted (if it was a temp|tation) to think that the nomination was partial; however I was re&s;olved, with the

<P>ABOUT the middle of February, ac|companied by brother C. I embark|ed for Halifax in Nova-Scotia.

Brother C. went on to Shelburne, and I continued in the city. My good friend Mr. M. hired a large room, and had it furni&s;hed with &s;eats and a pulpit. I preached to as many as attend|ed, almo&s;t every night in the week, and three times on the Lord's-day, during my &s;tay; and that with a degree of freedom: and I tru&s;t a few were awakened, and &s;ome were united in &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Having repeated invitations, I &s;et out in the latter end of March, on a journey through the country. In two week I tra|velled about three hundred miles, and preached twenty &s;ermons (though the &s;now was deep) to many attentive hearers; and I tru&s;t &s;ome were brought under a &s;erious concern about their &s;ouls: and a few old Methodi&s;ts, who were emigrants from Eu|rope, rejoiced to hear that glorious found, which they had been accu&s;tomed &s;o often to hear in their native land. When I re|turned again to Halifax, I found freedom to preach to the people, but labored under many trials. My few kind friends in Ha|lifax were not willing that I &s;hould leave
<PB N="201" REF="023401_0200_0FBF52CBDD2CAC78">them. The harve&s;t is great, and the labor|ers are few. I mu&s;t go where there is a probability of doing the mo&s;t good.

<PB N="202" REF="023401_0201_0FBF52CD38CFF200">appeared to be a &s;mall moving on the minds of individuals. I &s;taid a few days in this town, and preached &s;everal &s;ermons; and I doubt not but there were &s;everal powerfully awakened&mdash;and about twelve, who&s;e hearts &s;eemed to be touched, joined in &s;ociety.</P>
<P>I travelled through Wilmut, Gran&s;ville, Annapolis, and Digby, and had many to hear, but few were willing to give their hearts to God.

<P>Sunday June 5, 1785, I preached to many in Mr. E.'s barn; at eleven o'clock I admini&s;tered the &s;acrament to a few. In
<PB N="203" REF="023401_0202_0FBF52CEB57C94C8">the afternoon I preached again. Monday I preached at Horton, on the freedom of the will: and Tue&s;day met brother C. at Wind|&s;or. The day following about twenty of our friends, after &s;ermon, communicated with us; and we had a fea&s;t of love. Brother C. went on his way to Cumberland, to &s;up|ply brother B.'s place; for I had written to him to come to Halifax; and the Lord made him a ble&s;&s;ing to the people in that city.

<P>Tue&s;day July 26. I embarked for Li|verpool, and landed &s;afe on Friday, and had a time of refre&s;hment whil&s;t preaching in the meeting-hou&s;e. Captain D. who has &s;ince gone to heaven, &s;ome time before any of us came to this town, met with a little tract, written by Mr. We&s;ley, called the character of a Methodi&s;t, and having a great de&s;ire to hear one of tho&s;e men, &s;ent to Shelburne, and de&s;ired brother I. M. to give them a vi&s;it, which he did &s;hortly af|ter: and many of the people were very fond of his doctrine; but he was much
<PB N="204" REF="023401_0203_0FBF52D68D3B0A08">oppo&s;ed by a company of warm profe&s;&s;ors of religion, who were the followers of one Mr. A. One Lord's-day he went into the meeting-hou&s;e to preach, and a party of tho&s;e zealous di&s;ciples were determined if po&s;&s;ible to prevent it; and in all probability would, had not the magi&s;trate interfered: Colonel P. as mild a man in nature as any to be found, as well as a well-wi&s;her to all religious per&s;ua&s;ions, rea&s;oned very coolly with them, but to little purpo&s;e, till ano|ther magi&s;trate &s;poke more roughly, and then they gave over, and left the hou&s;e. After this they did not attempt an open attack, but &s;trove to prejudice the people again&s;t us.</P>
<P>When I came to town, I found that by the preaching of brother M. and brother C. the Lord had begun a work, and they had united twenty in &s;ociety. In this town there were about one thou&s;and inhabitants, be&s;ides little children. I was much plea&s;ed with the people, and found great freedom to preach the word.

<PB N="205" REF="023401_0204_0FBF52D88C529A20">I &s;taid in the town about four weeks, during which time I preached three, and &s;ometimes four &s;ermons on the Lord's day; and frequently on other evenings: and vi&s;ited from hou&s;e to hou&s;e. When I departed, I left forty in &s;ociety, &s;everal of whom had found pardon, and &s;everal were under deep di&s;tre&s;s; and I can &s;ay for my own part, it was a precious &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>In Augu&s;t I embarked for and arrived &s;afe in Shelburne, where I found &s;ixteen members of &s;ociety of whites, and &s;ome blacks, who were united by brother C. In this town there are many precious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, mo&s;tly refugees, and prone to evil as the &s;park is to fly upwards. In this town we had a little preaching-hou&s;e which was built by Mr. W.; and would accommodate about two hundred people. During my &s;tay my manner was as follows, viz. in the morning to preach in Shelburne at nine o'clock: then to walk to Burchtown three miles off, and preach to the black people at twelve o'clock: (there were about five hundred in the town who were able to attend, and they had built them&s;elves a church) then to return and preach in Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urne at five o'clock, and likewi&s;e by can|dle-light.
<PB N="206" REF="023401_0205_0FBF52D9F58E4FD8">I had not preached long till our church would not contain the people, &s;o that many went away for want of room. Mr. W. mini&s;ter of the Church of Eng|land, gave me an invitation to preach in his church: which I did three Sabbaths at five o'clock: and then there was no more place for me there. So I &s;tood on a large rock in the &s;treet, and cried, <HI>On this rock will I build my church, and the gates of hell &s;hall not prevail again&s;t it,</HI> Matt. xvi. 18. Our friends &s;oon enlarged our little hou&s;e, &s;o that it would accommodate three or four hundred; but &s;till it would by no means hold as many as wi&s;hed to hear. Agreea|bly to my de&s;ire, the blacks of Shelburne bunt them&s;elves a little hou&s;e at the North end of the town, and I preached to them &s;eparately, in order to have more room for the whites.</P>
<P>Our dear Ma&s;ter began to carry on a ble&s;&s;ed work; but the devil and his chil|dren were angry. They frequently &s;toned the hou&s;e; and one night a company came out, and &s;trove (as it &s;tood by the brow of a hill on pillars) to &s;hove it down.&mdash;Whil&s;t I was preaching to near four hundred peo|ple by candle-light, they were beating un|derneath,
<PB N="207" REF="023401_0206_0FBF52E0F3190A18">to get away the pillars&mdash;In the mid&s;t of my preaching I cried out, <HI>With|out are dogs, &s;orcerers, whoremongers, idola|ters, and who&s;oever loveth and maketh a lie.</HI> The company ran off with a hideous yel|ling, and we were left to wor&s;hip God peaceably.</P>
<P>During my &s;tay in and around Shel|burne (which was &s;ix weeks) numbers both white and black, were added to the &s;ocie|ty; and many ta&s;ted the good word of God, and felt the powers of the world to come.</P>
<P>Being under an engagement again to vi|&s;it the new &s;ocieties where I had been, I embarked for Liverpool. Shortly after we hoi&s;ted &s;ail (a man-of-war lay in the har|bour) an officer &s;aid to his fellows, "He is going," and they cried amain, "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Methodi&s;t par&s;on! hail the Methodi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> par&s;on!" Our captain paid no attention to them; but they followed us with a bullet from a cannon, though we pa&s;&s;ed on un|hurt. I touched at Liverpool and &s;taid two weeks, and found the work of the Lord pro&s;pering under the mini&s;try of bro|ther I. M. From thence I went to Hali|fax, and found the work pro&s;pering under
<PB N="208" REF="023401_0207_0FBF52E303F726E8">the mini&s;try of brother B. I &s;taid two weeks, and preached with a &s;mall degree of freedom. I want to do good! I want to live to the honor of my dear Lord! I want to be all glorious within! When, O when will my warfare with Satan end? Not till my work is done! I re&s;ign&mdash; Lord, I am willing to wait thine own good time.</P>
<P>My cu&s;tom was to travel mo&s;tly by &s;ea, in the &s;ummer; and by land, in the win|ter: and the Lord was with me.</P>
<P>I &s;pent the mo&s;t of this winter in the different towns between Halifax and An|napolis; and there was a gathering to the &s;ociety. My mind was often troubled with people of a di&s;putatious turn of mind; and was grieved at the hardne&s;s of their hearts. Whil&s;t in the wilderne&s;s, &s;urrounded by the impious, my mind was &s;taid on my dear Lord.</P>
<P>In the &s;pring 1786, I paid Liverpool my third vi&s;it; and from thence went to Shel|burne, and found that a black man, by the name of M&mdash;t, from England, had done much hurt. Surely if lady H. had him put into the mini&s;try (as he gave this account) her lady&s;hip was much deceived in the man;
<PB N="209" REF="023401_0208_0FBF52E487336628">or el&s;e he has &s;ince become an amazing bad one. I left near two hundred blacks in &s;ociety, and at my return I did not find half that number. When I went to their town, I called them together, and inform|ed them of his character. Many of them were convinced of their error, and return|ed to the &s;ociety; &s;o that in the whole we only lo&s;t about twenty per&s;ons. I likewi&s;e applied to their colonel, who was a black, or rather a yellow man, to have him put out of the town, which he con&s;ented to; &s;o there was once more a pro&s;pect of pro&s;|perity among them.</P>
<P>A town called Barrington lay heavy on my mind, and I had a great de&s;ire to vi&s;it its inhabitants. This town lies about thirty miles to the South We&s;t of Shelburne, having no other than a &s;mall foot-path which leads to it; &s;o that I was under the nece&s;&s;ity of going by &s;ea, or on foot. I &s;et out with A. E. for a pilot, as he had been there. I preached at Port-Ro&s;eway, where we had a &s;mall &s;ociety. From thence we went to Cape Negro, where we were kind|ly entertained by old Mr. S. who I tru&s;t had a love for our Saviour. With free|dom I preached to a few families, and the
<PB N="210" REF="023401_0209_0FBF52E5F93395D0">Lord began a good work. From thence I went to Barrington; and after wading good part of the way nearly half-leg deep in mud and water, we got into town about three o'clock on the third day of our jour|ney from Shelburne. I did not know of one per&s;on who would receive me, &s;o I &s;at down on a large &s;tone in the town, not far from the meeting-hou&s;e. Their form|er mini&s;ter who had left them, I was in|formed, had written a letter in which he &s;aid, there was one Garrett&s;on going through the country, who was a dangerous Arminian; and advi&s;ed them to be careful. I de&s;ired Mr. E. my companion and pilot, to notify the inhabitants, that a &s;tranger had come to town, and intended at an hour by &s;un to preach in the meeting-hou&s;e. The hour commenced and I had about twenty hearers; and appointed to preach the next day at the &s;ame time. The peo|ple all withdrew, and there was no one to &s;ay, Will you go home with me? I told my friend, he mu&s;t get a home as he could, and I went to the hou&s;e of a gentleman who a&s;ked me to drink tea, but not to &s;tay all night. I a&s;ked him if there was a board|ing-hou&s;e, or taver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> in town; he &s;aid there
<PB N="211" REF="023401_0210_0FBF52F01BB3DF88">was not, and it was not convenient for me to &s;tay with him, or he would make me welcome. However, rather than &s;tay out all night, I went to another hou&s;e; and gave my&s;elf an invitation, and was not denied.</P>
<P>The next day about thirty came out to hear; and I then had an invitation to an hou&s;e. The day following I appointed to preach morning, afternoon, and evening; but the people were much afraid of being deceived. My mind was greatly di&s;tre&s;|&s;ed; and I was almo&s;t ready to leave the place; for the people looked very coldly on me.</P>
<P>About an hundred came to hear; I preached two &s;ermons, and concluded not to preach in the evening, as I had an invi|tation to go home with Mr. S. a very cle|ver man, who lived on a little i&s;land about &s;even miles off: in this man I found a friend. On this little i&s;land I preached &s;everal &s;ermons with freedom: and began to think, that the Lord had a work for me to do.</P>
<P>The following Friday I went to another little i&s;land, to Mrs. D.'s, who had a friend|&s;hip for religious people. Whil&s;t I was
<PB N="212" REF="023401_0211_0FBF52F1F5975C40">on this i&s;land, a Mr. C. came; whom I invited by a me&s;&s;enger to attend my mini|&s;try, and &s;peak after me; but this he re|fu&s;ed. In the evening I preached on the main land, not far from the meeting-hou&s;e, to a few; but pride and unbelief keep out the word. Saturday I attended the mini&s;|try of Mr. C. To-morrow, &s;aid I (after meeting was out) I have an appointment in the meeting-hou&s;e; and the days are long enough for us both to preach: this he re|fu&s;ed; but appointed to preach in a private hou&s;e. This kind of conduct in him a&s;to|ni&s;hed the &s;pectators; but &s;till the people were afraid of the Arminians.</P>
<P>Sunday. This morning my mind was amazingly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. I was afraid the Lord had not called me to this town. I mourn|ed in &s;ecret, and intreated the Lord to make it manife&s;t that he had &s;ent me to this place, by a di&s;play of his convincing pow|er among the people. The hour came, and I repaired to the meeting-hou&s;e; none were pre&s;ent but my pilot (and he was greatly &s;haken, and in doubt which wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to go) and two others. My di&s;tre&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> was to be &s;en&s;ibly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> a little wood, a quarter of a mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="213" REF="023401_0212_0FBF52F378135CA8">the meeting-hou&s;e, and intreated the Lord, if he required me to preach in the place, to &s;end out the people and ble&s;s his word. As I was again a&s;cending the hill, toward the meeting-hou&s;e, re&s;olving within my&s;elf, that if the people did not attend, and if the word was not ble&s;t, I would leave the town, and conclude that I was not called thereto. But I &s;aw the people coming from every part of the town, and in a &s;hort time we had a large gathering, and immediately the cloud broke from my mind, and with a gl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d heart I a&s;cended the pulpit &s;tairs; and the word of the Lord &s;eemed all open to me. I preached and the flame ran through the a&s;&s;embly: in the afternoon I preached again, with the &s;ame freedom. Among two or three hundred people, it appeared as though there were but few pre&s;ent, but in a greater or le&s;s degree felt the flame. After meeting was ended, they came around me on every hand in tears; and I &s;uppo&s;e I had invitations to more than twenty hou&s;es.</P>
<P>Having an appointment at Shelburne, we &s;et out; but after I got there I &s;taid only a few days, and returned to take care of the awakened fouls. And in my return, I
<PB N="214" REF="023401_0213_0FBF52F51176AC30">called at Cape Negro; and the Lord be|gan a ble&s;&s;ed work in &s;everal families there. When I got to Barrington, I found many hungering after the word. I took the town in rotation, and vi&s;ited the greater part of the families; and I went to but few hou&s;es, at which there had been no awakenings. Mrs. A. and two of '&s;quire H.'s &s;ons' wives, had experienced the pardoning love of God; together with &s;everal others. Now it wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that many were willing to be called <HI>Arminians,</HI> and join &s;ociety.</P>
<P>I paid Cape Negro a vi&s;it, and found Mrs. S. under deep conviction, and &s;eve|ral others; I preached with freedom, and returned, accompanied by near a dozen, and among the re&s;t was old Mrs. S. under deep di&s;tre&s;s of &s;oul, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> nine miles; and the next day &s;he was baptized; and what was much better, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> received remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins; and returned home on Monday prai&s;ing the Lord. Mr. A. who had been at &s;ea, and had never heard a Methodi&s;t, came home in the mid&s;t of this &s;tir; and the Lord touched his heart, and he wept at his feet. Mrs. D. (wife to the '&s;quire) and &s;everal others were powerfully wrought upon. I vi&s;ited them; and Mrs.
<PB N="215" REF="023401_0214_0FBF53334ADAE670">D. &s;aid, "I am afraid there is no mercy for me! when I was eleven years old in England, under the preaching of Mr. We&s;|ley and Mr. Whitefield, I was convinced; and Mr. Whitefield received me for a con|vert, but now I am a gro&s;s back&s;lider." A young woman under deep di&s;tre&s;s, who was at her hou&s;e, retired, and was re&s;olved not to re&s;t till her &s;oul was ble&s;t: and &s;o it was, for about three o'clock the Lord gave her a new heart, and put a joyful &s;ong in her mouth. She came where I preach|ed in the afternoon, full of love, and went all round the hou&s;e among the young peo|ple; and talked to them, to the admiration of all pre&s;ent. I preached from, <HI>Our en|trance in unto you is not in vain.</HI> I vi&s;ited Mr. A. who was under deep di&s;tre&s;s. "O! &s;aid he, what an alteration there is in the town&mdash;the people do not look like the &s;ame."</P>
<P>By this time the Lord had rai&s;ed up a young preacher, J. M. who came to me, and was helpful in the work. I continued in Shelburne, Barrington, and the adjacent &s;ettlements around, till Autumn; and our dear Lord did great things for many. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e|ing under a nece&s;&s;ity to vi&s;it the Ea&s;t, I left
<PB N="216" REF="023401_0215_0FBF5334B76DA6C8">J. M. to take care of the new-born chil|dren; and embarked for Liverpool; where there had been a ble&s;&s;ed work under brother I. M. I think he informed me, that the Lord made u&s;e of the &s;udden death of our our worthy friend captain D. to begin this revival. I find a great alteration in this town. The fir&s;t time I vi&s;ited the people here, we only had &s;even communicants; the &s;econd time we had twenty; the third vi&s;it we had near forty; and now we have more than &s;ixty. Many in this town were taught to believe, that none ought to com|municate but &s;uch as have the witne&s;s of their ju&s;tification. In my third vi&s;it, two women came to me on Saturday evening, and &s;aid, "we wi&s;h to commune to-morrow if we can get admittance." They &s;aid it was pre&s;&s;ed on their minds as a duty. I be|lieved they were mourning after a Saviour; and told them, I was willing that they &s;hould commemorate the death of that Sa|viour, who&s;e mo&s;t precious blood was &s;hed for the remi&s;&s;ion of their &s;in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and de&s;ir|ed them to expect a ble&s;&s;ing at the table. That night my enemies got hold of it, and it ran through the town that I had admit|ted two unconverted women to the table.
<PB N="217" REF="023401_0216_0FBF533643CEDA80">The next day we had a precious time at the communion, and the Lord vi&s;ited the &s;ouls of tho&s;e two women whil&s;t at the ta|ble: the change &s;eemed vi&s;ible to many of the &s;pectators&mdash;and our enemies when they heard of it, were a&s;hamed. I went to Halifax, Wind&s;or, Horton and Coruwallis, where I &s;pent the winter; except a few excur&s;ions through a few other adjacent &s;ettlements. In <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">orton, this winter, I favorably hope the Lord did ble&s;s my weak endeavours&mdash;I preached the word with freedom in different parts of the town; and many were added to the &s;ociety. There are many in that town that are near to me, and I &s;hall not &s;oon forget the kindne&s;s &s;hewed me by Mr. and Mrs. C. Mr. and Mrs. S. and &s;everal others. O! that our good and gracious God may look on all tho&s;e who &s;hew kindne&s;s to his children; and grant them the &s;anctifying influence of his holy Spirit. I received a letter from Dr. Coke, in which I was reque&s;ted to at|tend the Baltimore conference. It was with reluctance I came to this country; but I now feel a willingne&s;s to labor and &s;uffer in the cau&s;e of God among this peo|ple. I came to Wind&s;or, where I had
<PB N="218" REF="023401_0217_0FBF5337C47484A8">great con&s;olation. Mrs. S. was a woman of a mo&s;t excellent &s;pirit, and her hu&s;band was a very kind man. Dear Mrs. S.

I came to Halifax, where I found our good friend Mr. M. bu&s;ily em|ployed in building us a church. Of all the women whom I have met with, I have not found one more kind than Mrs M. but &s;he is now no more: and my heart was glad, when I heard that her faith was &s;trong in her la&s;t moments. I travelled, labored, and &s;uffered in this country, a lit|tle more than two years. My dear Lord was with me by land and &s;ea. After all, I am an unprofitable &s;ervant&mdash;my greate&s;t wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and de&s;ire is, to do &s;omething to pro|mote the intere&s;t of my dear Lord's king|dom. Monday April 10, 1787, I bade my Halifax friends farewell; and &s;o leav|ing my dear Nova-Scotians, embarked with captain Wil&s;on for Bo&s;ton.

<HEAD>SECTION XIII. THE CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>SUNDAY April 16, I preached in the cabin with freedom. The wind was high and contrary, &s;o that for the pre&s;er|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ation of our lives and ve&s;&s;el we came to anchor between two i&s;lands. I had an op|portunity of preaching on each i&s;land; and gave a few books to the poor, and left ma|ny in tears, who&s;e hearts the Lord had touched. On Wedne&s;day 19, I landed in Bo&s;ton: preached a few &s;ermons with free|dom, was kindly entertained by Mr. S. and on Monday 24, took the &s;tage for Providence. Here I &s;taid at Mr. S.'s, who is a godly Pre&s;byterian mini&s;ter.&mdash; The bell rang the next day at &s;ix o'clock, and I found freedom to preach. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ening following I preached again to ma|ny &s;erious hearers, in Mr. S.'s meeting-hou&s;e. I had &s;ome conver&s;ation with a dei&s;t, who appeared to be good-natured in his way. I &s;ailed to Newport, and had freedom in preaching two &s;ermons there, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Mr. F.'s meeting-hou&s;e, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her in Mr. T.'s; and the people behaved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ery well&mdash;A gentleman came to me after
<PB N="220" REF="023401_0219_0FBF5341A34F3AF8">&s;ermon, and &s;aid, "You have a great gift, but I will hear you no more; for your doc|trine I do not like." From Newport I &s;ailed to New-York, where I had an op|portunity to preach in the Methodi&s;t church on Sunday April 30. After &s;pending a few days agreeably there, I took a &s;addle-hor&s;e, and rode through the Jer&s;eys, and had an agreeable time among my old friends; and &s;o came to Philadelphia on Saturday.</P>
<P>On the Lord's-day, I found great freedom in preaching there to a people very near to me; and was rejoiced to find the church in a pro&s;perous way. I then pur&s;ued my way to Baltimore: where many of the dear &s;ervants of God met in conference. It was the de&s;ire of Mr. We&s;ley and others, that I &s;hould be &s;et apart for the &s;uperin|tendency of the work in Nora-Scotia&mdash;my mind was divided&mdash;man is a fallible crea|ture&mdash;In the end I concluded not to leave the &s;tates; for thou&s;ands in this country are dear to me.

<P>Sunday May 14th, I preac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the college; and after vi&s;iting &s;ome of my
<PB N="221" REF="023401_0220_0FBF534305EEC898">relations, I &s;et out on my way to fulfil my appointment.</P>
<P>Friday 19th, I called on that loving &s;o|ciety at Duck-creek-cro&s;s-roads, and had great freedom to preach the word.</P>
<P>Saturday 20th, I got to Mr. B.'s, and on Sunday preached with freedom in the Methodi&s;t church in Dover. I vi&s;ited B. and P. and found them &s;till in a back&s;liding &s;tate. This week was &s;pent joyfully among a people whom I had not &s;een for a long time.</P>
<P>Sunday May 28, 1787. I preached in Tuckehoe church to about a thou&s;and peo|ple. Many happy moments I have had in this Neck in years pa&s;t, and we have not forgotten old tunes. A &s;piritual gale ran through the congregation&mdash;my con&s;ola<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">on and the con&s;olation of the people was &s;o great, that I appointed to preach in the &s;ame church the next day; and had near as many hearers as there were the day be|fore. After &s;ermon I rode on my way, and unexpectedly met a congre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ion of about an hundred, who came out to me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> me as I pa&s;&s;ed; I preached a &s;hort <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to them: and went to colonel H.'s, where I was rejoiced to meet brother C. and
<PB N="222" REF="023401_0221_0FBF5344730CBDA8">many others of my old friends; and had great freedom in a lecture on the parable of the prodigal &s;on, to a crowded audience who a&s;&s;embled in the evening.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day 30th. At Talbot court-hou&s;e I was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee the gathered multi|tude from all quarters. I &s;uppo&s;e there were above five hundred more than our little chapel could hold. Lord, keep me humble! I fear many had a greater de&s;ire to &s;ee the &s;ervant, than to partake of the crumbs from the Ma&s;ter's table. Many were di&s;appointed, for I had very little li|berty. The people in this part of the country &s;eem as if they would be all Me|thodi&s;ts. It is a &s;mall thing to be a Me|thodi&s;t in name only; but it is a great thing to love the Lord with all the heart, and our neighbour as our&s;elves.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day 31. In the forenoon I preached to that little per&s;ecuted flock at brother R.'s; and in the afternoon, I had a ble&s;&s;ed time at the Bay&s;ide-chapel. I preached in Miles-river Neck; and the day following about four hundred attended my mini&s;try at Bolingbroke chapel. This &s;o|ciety will not hold their fellow-creatures in bondage. A great harmony &s;ub&s;i&s;ts among
<PB N="223" REF="023401_0222_0FBF534C98CBEA68">tho&s;e people, and I feel my heart united to them.</P>
<P>Saturday June 3. I cro&s;&s;ed the river in|to Dor&s;et, a place where I de&s;ired to be. Sunday 4. At brother M.'s I met &s;o large a congregation, that I was under a nece&s;&s;i|ty of withdrawing to the &s;hade for room. Some time ago there was a great work of the Lord in this Neck; but I am informed the work is now rather at a &s;tand. What is the cau&s;e? Tho&s;e preachers who&s;e la|bors the Lord particularly ble&s;t in this re|vival, were lively and powerful; and there was much of what &s;ome call wild-fire among the people: the cries of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed were frequently &s;o great, that the preacher's voice was drowned. I was informed that tho&s;e people had been vi&s;ited by &s;ome, who had but little friend&s;hip for what &s;ome call hollowing meetings; and the work began to decline. The danger lies on both hands; and ble&s;&s;ed is he who knows how to &s;teer aright. I am never di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in hearing convinced &s;inners crying for mercy; though they were to cry &s;o loud as to be heard a mile. And I doubt not, but the children of the Lord are &s;o happy at times, that they are almo&s;t carried out of them|&s;elves,
<PB N="224" REF="023401_0223_0FBF534DECA15E88">and con&s;trained to &s;hout forth his prai&s;es.</P>
<P>Sunday June 11, I preached in our new chapel on Taylor's i&s;land to abundantly more people than the chapel could contain. Many on this i&s;land love God.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day 13, I preached on Hooper's i&s;land, and we had a precious &s;hower. Before our meeting ended five &s;ouls were new-born; three of whom were &s;i&s;ters. There were many awakened at this meet|ing; and great cries were among&s;t the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. There was as little confu&s;ion as I have ever &s;een, where there was &s;o great a power felt.</P>
<P>I continued in the Penin&s;ula till May 1788; during which time I was &s;eldom a day without preaching, and frequently twice or thrice in a day; and that with great freedom. I cannot &s;ay that there was an univer&s;al gathering; but I tru&s;t the church was edified and built up in the faith. During this year, I travelled through and preached in every county on the Ea&s;t|ern-Shore, which are three of Virginia, three of Delaware, and eight of Mary|land.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="023401_0224_0FBF534EF9934DB8">
It was on my mind to go to Bo&s;ton, and with the approbation of Mr. F. A. I &s;et out on my journey in May 1788. When I got to New-York, I found brother H. at the point of death. The harve&s;t being great and the laborers few, I was prevailed on by brother D. to &s;tay till the York con|ference, which was to be held in October. During which time I &s;taid mo&s;tly in the city; except &s;ome excur&s;ions through Long-I&s;land and New-Rochelle circuits. Before the &s;itting of conference, I had received invitations from a variety of places; and letters came to conference, in which we were intreated to &s;end help to &s;everal places. I was con&s;cious to my&s;elf, that it was not expedient for me at that time to pur&s;ue my way to Bo&s;ton; though I had an eye to that place.</P>
<P>At the conference I was appointed to take charge of the Northern di&s;trict; which at that time con&s;i&s;ted of New-York, Long-I&s;land, and New-Rochelle circuits. After conference ended, I &s;et out to the North with about twelve young preachers to form circuits; and our dear Lord opened our way in a mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing manner: although much evil was &s;aid of us. Many hou&s;es,
<PB N="226" REF="023401_0225_0FBF5350AF542E30">hands, and hearts were opened; and be|fore the commencement of the winter, we had &s;everal large circuits formed; and the the mo&s;t of the preachers were comforta|bly &s;ituated; and &s;inners in a variety of places began to enquire, what they &s;hould do to be &s;aved.</P>
<P>Satan and his children were much alarm|ed, and began on every hand to throw out threats again&s;t us. Some &s;aid, "They are good men;" others &s;aid, "Nay, they are deceivers of the people." A &s;tranger from the new &s;tate on his way down the coun|try, informed the people that we were &s;pread all through the country through which he came. This &s;udden and univer&s;al &s;pread cau&s;ed &s;ome per&s;on to &s;ay, "I know not from whence they all come, unle&s;s from the clouds." Others &s;aid, "The king of England hath &s;ent them to di&s;affect the people; and they did not doubt, but they would bring on another war." Whil&s;t others gave it as their opinion, that we were the fal&s;e prophets &s;poken of in &s;crip|ture, who &s;hould come in the la&s;t days, and deceive, if it were po&s;&s;ible, the very elect. Among others, the mini&s;ters of the different denominations were alarmed, fear|ing
<PB N="227" REF="023401_0226_0FBF53586B727B78">le&s;t we &s;hould break up their congrega|tions; and frequently coming to hear, &s;ome of them openly oppo&s;ed, declaring public|ly that the doctrine was fal&s;e. The power of the Lord attended the word, and a great reformation was &s;een among the people; and many were enabled to &s;peak freely and feelingly of what God had done for their &s;ouls. My cu&s;tom was to go round the di&s;trict every three months, and then re|turn to New-York; where I commonly &s;taid about two weeks. In going once round I u&s;ually travelled about a thou&s;and miles, and preached upwards of an hun|dred &s;ermons.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day June 9, 1789. I left New-York accompanied by brother N. to Ea&s;t-Che&s;ter; and in the evening had an oppor|tunity of hearing Mr. F. A. and Mr. W. and the word was powerfully felt. The next day I accompanied them to New-Ca&s;|tle; and &s;at with delight under the word. The morning following we parted; and the remainder of the week I &s;pent mo&s;tly in writing.</P>
<P>Sunday 14. I found liberty in preach|ing to a &s;olemn company in our new church at New-Ca&s;tle, on Naaman's clean&s;|ing;
<PB N="228" REF="023401_0227_0FBF535A43D8C1A8">and in the afternoon I heard brother L. at Bedford; and clo&s;ed the meeting with an exhortation. Here we joined a &s;ociety. The people were brought up in the Calyinian line, but many are convinced that &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem does not reflect glory on the Deity; and they are willing to flee from it, though there are two mini&s;ters who u&s;e their &s;trength in oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Monday 15th, I found great freedom to preach to a loving &s;ociety, formed by bro|thers M. and B. at Mr. H.'s, and had rea|&s;on to believe that many of them were en|gaged for the &s;alvation of their precious &s;ouls. Their &s;inging was delightful.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day 16th. In the morning I found my mind free in preaching the word at Stony-&s;treet church; and in the evening the Lord was with us at the Engli&s;h church at Peak's-kiln; and I had a comfortable night at G. C.'s. This is an affectionate family; and they &s;eem very attentive to the word of the Lord.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day 17th, I rode ten miles and preached to a people gathered from the mountains; and then went to brother J.'s, about twenty miles, and had great liberty in the word. There &s;eemed to be a &s;ilent
<PB N="229" REF="023401_0228_0FBF535BC8786948">&s;truggling among the people, whil&s;t I en|deavoured to dwell on the deep things of God. I vi&s;ited dear brother Cook, and found him near death. But his &s;oul was happy in God his Saviour.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day 18th. Accompanied by a friend twenty-five miles, I met brother F. A. and brother W. at doctor B.'s, where I heard a good &s;ermon and an encouraging exhortation; as I al&s;o did the day follow|ing. Saturday we parted, and I had a te|dious day.</P>
<P>Sunday 21. The &s;un this morning aro&s;e with his u&s;ual lu&s;tre, and di&s;per&s;ed light through all the lower creation. Je&s;us, the much brighter &s;un, was precious to me. I preached in a barn, in the morning, at Ryn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ck; then rode 8 miles lower down, and preached in another barn, and had great liberty; and &s;ound a few who&s;e hearts the Lord had touched when I was there before. I returned and preached again at &s;ix o'clock: but fear the word had no place in the hearts of the hearers&mdash;I was much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed&mdash;dear Lord! man is weak. But when thou di&s;playe&s;t thy convincing pow|er, the work is done. I rode to and &s;pent the mo&s;t of this week in the city of Hud&s;on.
<PB N="230" REF="023401_0229_0FBF535E217F7C38">In this place I have had &s;ome &s;weet mo|ments, and been greatly encouraged; but I now feel the need of patience&mdash;have I &s;pent &s;o much labor for nought? Have none been benefited by my mini&s;try in this place? Some have been made angry, but a few al&s;o have been benefited&mdash;I am clear in the matter, having warned, invited, and handed out the promi&s;es with tears. So I let the matter re&s;t with the Lord, who &s;aid, <HI>O Jeru&s;alem! how oft would I have gather|ed you, and ye would not?</HI></P>
<P>Monday 29. Accompanied by one of the preachers, I rode on to brother B.'s, and on my way I &s;topped and preached in a cool &s;ummer-hou&s;e made of green boughs, to near two hundred precious &s;ouls, who &s;eemed to drink in the word. I am fully convinced (and it is an ob&s;ervation which I have made the&s;e many years) that poor people in general are more fond of the go&s;|pel than the rich. And this is agreeable to the doctrine of our Lord. I had a pre|cious, &s;weet time among tho&s;e people. More than twelve months ago I was &s;oli|cited to preach among them; but never had an opportunity till now.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="023401_0230_0FBF535FFA0AB038">
Tue&s;day 30. I preached in Mr. V. D.'s large barn to many &s;erious hearers; and perceived that the Lord was carrying on a work on the patent by the in&s;trumentality of brother C&mdash;, a young preacher who had ju&s;t entered the field.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day I rode 14 miles to Albany. Some time ago I petitioned the a&s;&s;embly (as they were then &s;itting) for liberty of the city-hail; acce&s;s to which I have had ever &s;ince; but many in the city &s;eem much &s;et again&s;t the Methodi&s;ts. The hearts of a few were touched, and &s;everal joined in a &s;ociety which has gradually increa&s;ed ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>Sunday July 5, I preached in Schenec|tady at 10, and at 3 o'clock in the Engli&s;h church, and in the evening in a &s;pacious hall, and had great hope that good would be done in the town. Prejudice hath ta|ken deep root in the hearts of the&s;e peo|ple; at pre&s;ent, I fear, there is very little vital piety in the place.</P>
<P>Monday July 6. I &s;et out on a journey to the North, and on my way I overtook an old gentleman, who &s;aid, "I expect you are a mini&s;ter. O! it is a ble&s;&s;ed work, if you are called to it. I am a fol|lower
<PB N="232" REF="023401_0231_0FBF536602D37708">lower of Chri&s;t, and know my peace made with God." How, &s;aid I, do you know that? "By the &s;pirit which he has given me." Do you, &s;aid I, know that your &s;ins are forgiven? "O yes." Do you, &s;aid I, live in &s;in? "Yes, we are all &s;inners." Pray, &s;aid I, how can you know your &s;ins forgiven, if you live in &s;in? "I have the imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, and it is no more I that do it, but &s;in that dwells in me." Don't you, &s;aid I, &s;wear &s;ometimes? "Swear, yes, and have been drunk too, many times &s;ince I was made a new crea|ture, but my comfort is, I cannot fall." What, &s;aid I, would become of your &s;oul, if you were to die drunk? "Die drunk! what would you think to &s;ee the &s;un fall? was it ever known that a &s;aint died drunk? impo&s;&s;ible!" Well, &s;aid I, according to your doctrine, if you always keep your&s;elf intoxicated with &s;trong liquor, you will ne|ver die. Sin made man mortal; but I can|not find from &s;cripture that drunkenne&s;s makes him immortal. "Sir," &s;aid he, "I perceive you are a rank Arminian, and I would not go the length of my foot to hear you preach, for you are an accu&s;er of the brethren; and hold out a very uncomfort|able
<PB N="233" REF="023401_0232_0FBF536702F35730">doctrine to God's dear children." Pray, &s;aid I, what denomination do you profe&s;s? "I am an old Engli&s;hman, and a convert of Mr. Whitefield's, and a New-Light by profe&s;&s;ion, from the &s;ole of my foot to the crown of my head." After I endeavoured to &s;et his danger before him, I wi&s;hed him well; and riding thirty miles I found great liberty to preach my dear Lord's go&s;pel, from the language of the gaoler, <HI>What &s;hall I do to be &s;aved?</HI></P>
<P>I travelled and preached through the country, and many gathered to hear the word; but many were much afraid of be|ing deceived by a fal&s;e prophet, &s;o termed by &s;ome. I preached in A&s;h-grove, where w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> have many kind friends who have built us a church. When I fir&s;t came into this &s;ettlement, I found &s;ome emigrants from Ireland, who had been acquainted with the Methodi&s;ts; but there were very few of them, who retained the power of religion: though I &s;oon perceived, that the doctrine was as a &s;alve to a fe&s;tering wound. Back|fliders were healed, and many who had ne|ver been acquainted with tho&s;e men before, were brought to experience the faith which ju&s;tifies the ungodly. In &s;everal places in
<PB N="234" REF="023401_0233_0FBF53687B7D0CB8">this circuit, the Lord made D. D. in&s;tru|mental in the conver&s;ion of &s;ouls.</P>
<P>Saturday and Sunday were the days of our quarterly meeting; and a precious &s;weet time we had. It was held in bro|ther R.'s barn, and I think we had an ad|dition of about twenty communicants. I baptized eight adults in the hou&s;e, and one by immer&s;ion; al&s;o &s;everal children. We had about two hundred pre&s;ent at the love|fea&s;t, mo&s;t of whom were young converts. In the evening I had a conver&s;ation with a woman who informed me, that &s;he was brought to experience the love of God not far from Bo&s;ton; and being &s;urrounded by the Bapti&s;ts, they &s;trove to per&s;uade her to renounce her infant bapti&s;m, and enter more deep into bapti&s;mal water. By their continual &s;olicitations and arguments, her mind became confu&s;ed, &s;o that &s;he was in doubt re&s;pecting the matter, and earne&s;tly prayed to the Lord to &s;hew her his will.&mdash; One night after &s;he had thus prayed, &s;he went to bed, and not long after her eyes were clo&s;ed in &s;leep, &s;he thought &s;he &s;aw our dear Lord with his arms extended and an infant pre&s;ented to bapti&s;m. She awoke without a doubt or fear, re&s;pecting the va|lidity
<PB N="235" REF="023401_0234_0FBF5370999D7308">of infant bapti&s;m. Some time after this, in the &s;tate of Vermont, &s;he had an opportunity of hearing the Methodi&s;ts, who, &s;he immediately perceived, preached the &s;ame doctrine which the Lord had taught her; and &s;he had never before met with a people with whom &s;he could join.</P>
<P>Monday July 14. After I had ended my vi&s;it through Cambridge circuit, I came to Albany, where I met the &s;mall &s;ociety; and the next day rode to doctor H.'s. My hor&s;e being very lame, and I not able to get another for a few days, either for love or money, I &s;et out on foot; and after I had walked near twenty miles, I came to Spence-town, with my &s;ame hor&s;e hopping behind me; and had at captain S.'s a pre|cious, &s;weet time among the people. In &s;pite of all the oppo&s;ition, our gracious God has carried on a ble&s;&s;ed work around this place. Tue&s;day I preached in Sheffield, where I was greatly oppo&s;ed; but the Lord has plucked a few brands from the burn|ing. The day following I dined at colonel B.'s, of Canaan: and in the afternoon held forth in the Pre&s;byterian meeting-hou&s;e. The people of this town are mild and ca|tholic. Their former mini&s;ter (Mr. T.) was
<PB N="236" REF="023401_0235_0FBF5371F74F2248">a catholic man, and did not do as &s;ome have done, prejudice and harden the hearts of the people again&s;t other denominations, e&s;pecially Arminians, as we are called. Our dear Lord, by the in&s;trumentality of brother W. brother B. and others, has con|vinced and converted a number of &s;ouls in different parts of this town; &s;o that at pre|&s;ent we have &s;everal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Saturday 18, our quarterly meeting be|gan. Souls are flocking to Je&s;us. The number of di&s;ciples increa&s;es. Je&s;us rode in his go&s;pel-chariot in Mr. C.'s barn on the Lord's-day, whil&s;t I was declaring, <HI>The ran&s;omed of the Lord &s;hall return, and come to Zion, &amp;c.</HI> Brother B. a&s;&s;i&s;ted me in the admini&s;tration of the &s;upper. In this part of our Lord's vineyard, many have been much troubled with Antinomiani&s;m; but the di&s;mal gloom is vani&s;hing away.&mdash; I continued round on my regular plan, till on Thur&s;day July 23, I came to Sharon, where I was met by a number of precious &s;ouls, to whom I preached in the afternoon in the open air, for want of room in the hou&s;e. Surely the Lord has a work to do in this town. Mr. S. &s;ays we are leading
<PB N="237" REF="023401_0236_0FBF5373000EF808">&s;ouls to hell: but, ble&s;&s;ed be God, many will not believe it.</P>
<P>Friday 24. This was a &s;weet morning to my &s;oul&mdash;I continued writing &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively till two o'clock exclu&s;ive of &s;ome in|tervals. The day pa&s;&s;ed &s;weetly away.&mdash; When I looked at my watch, I perceived I had &s;carce time to get to my appoint|ment; and ro&s;e from my &s;eat in ha&s;te. The man of the hou&s;e had gone out, and left the hor&s;e tied in the meadow by a long rope, to be handy when I wanted him. I took the bridle and went out, in order to make ready for my journey: and not con|&s;idering him to be a borrowed hor&s;e (mine was too lame to be u&s;ed) when I took hold of the rope, and began to gather him to me, he was &s;eared, and began to run; and by &s;ome means I was entangled in the rope &mdash;how it was I cannot tell, but I felt my|&s;elf in the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s: I lay by the fence bereft of the u&s;e of my &s;en&s;es, as well as limbs. For a long time I could not tell who, or what, or where I was; till at length I &s;aw in my hat (as I had been &s;triv|ing to get it to lay my head on) the two fir&s;t letters of my name, and knew who I was; and immediately called on the name
<PB N="238" REF="023401_0237_0FBF5374B6E2D3B8">of the Lord, who gave me power to ri&s;e up, and walk to the hou&s;e. A phy&s;ician was immediately &s;ent for; and when he came, he found me much brui&s;ed, my right &s;houlder di&s;located, and almo&s;t every joint in my hands and arms much &s;trained. Af|ter my &s;houlder was &s;et, and blood let, I was re&s;tored perfectly to my &s;en&s;es. Ma|ny of the neighbours gathered in: and I think in all my life I never had a greater &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e words, <HI>Thou &s;halt love the Lord with all thy heart.</HI> Tho&s;e around ex|pected me to die. But as I lay on my bed I was con&s;trained to cry out, <HI>Perfect love ca&s;teth out fear.</HI> Now, &s;aid I, I know there is a reality in the religion which I have been recommending to others for the&s;e many years; as well as a truth in the Me|thodi&s;t doctrine, &s;o called. I had &s;uch a love for the doctrine and cau&s;e, that it &s;eemed as if I would freely have gone to the &s;take for it. I did not dare to mur|mur; but cried out, <HI>Lord, it is good for me to be afflicted.</HI> I was never more re|conciled to the dealings of a good and gra|cious God. I was con&s;trained, and that in a flood of tears, to exhort all tho&s;e around to fly to Je&s;us: for I &s;aw a fulne&s;s in him
<PB N="239" REF="023401_0238_0FBF537D21E615D8">for every creature. But one thing induced me to indulge a de&s;ire to &s;tay longer in this world; and that was to be in&s;trumen|tal in doing good in the church.</P>
<P>Saturday 24. I de&s;ired a friend to make ready a carriage, for I had a longing de&s;ire to attend the Dover quarterly meeting.&mdash; That evening I got as far as Oblong, where I lodged at the hou&s;e of an old doc|tor, and received much &s;trength, and in the morning I got to Dover church, and was enabled to admini&s;ter the &s;upper to ma|ny of God's dear children: and afterward to preach with great liberty. I was attend|ed by brother L. to my appointments, till I got to North-Ca&s;tle; where I thought it mo&s;t expedient to decline attending my New-England appointments, for I could by no means ride on hor&s;e-back; and the roads were too rough for a chai&s;e; and withal I could only get in and out with help; and that with a degree of pain. I withdrew to the city of New-York, where I &s;taid about ten days, and then met my appointment on Long-I&s;land, and had a precious, &s;weet &s;ea|&s;on. After I had fulfilled my appointments on the i&s;land, on Wedne&s;day Augu&s;t 19, accompanied by a friend, I returned to
<PB N="240" REF="023401_0239_0FBF537F0DAD8A88">the city, and had a favorable hope that any affliction was &s;anctified for my good; and it al&s;o proved a ble&s;&s;ing to &s;ome in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he town where it happened. Surely the Lord is preparing me for &s;ome &s;evere trial. The church in this city is gaining ground under the mini&s;try of brother M. and bro|ther C.</P>
<P>Sunday 23. I was re&s;olved, God being my helper, to devote this day without re|&s;erve to him: and was very happy both in public and private. I preached two &s;er|mons, and &s;everal hours pa&s;t away in &s;oli|tude.</P>
<P>Friday Augu&s;t 28th. Having fini&s;hed a piece of writing, I again &s;et out on my journey round the di&s;trict, and found a gra|dual gathering to the church in almo&s;t every place; the &s;ociety-members, as well as communicants, greatly increa&s;ed. My mind was much exerci&s;ed frequently; but I could find my all in the Lord Je&s;us. In my return I vi&s;ited &s;everal towns in Con|necticut, to which I had not been before, and found enlargement of heart to preach among the people.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day November 19th, I returned to New-York, on my way to the council held
<PB N="241" REF="023401_0240_0FBF5380788BB158">in Baltimore: which journey was render|ed a great ble&s;&s;ing to me. When I left Baltimore I was re&s;olved, God being my helper, to be more than ever engaged in the glorious work; and it was my earne&s;t prayer, that, as in the South, the flame might break forth with us. I felt &s;ome|thing of it in Philadelphia; and when I came to New-York, I preached with an en|largement which I had never felt in that city before; and had faith to believe, that the brethren would have glorious times; and &s;o it was; for a few days after I left the city, the work, in a mo&s;t extraordi|nary manner, broke out: fir&s;t in a prayer|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eeting, and then in the congregation; and I &s;aw and felt &s;omething of the &s;ame <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ame, in many places round the di&s;trict, in my winter vi&s;itation.</P>
<P>I had to encounter a variety of difficul|ties. In common the church-people do not oppo&s;e us in doctrine; but in this place, where we had a good &s;ociety, one of this order of men went and preached, and &s;pread books, and the minds of &s;everal were much confu&s;ed; and they concluded they would not commune with us any more &mdash; I preached from the&s;e words, <HI>We preach not
<PB N="242" REF="023401_0241_0FBF53821B8787F8">our&s;elves, but Chri&s;t Je&s;us the Lord, and our|&s;elves your &s;ervants for Je&s;us's &s;ake.</HI> When our dear Lord &s;ent out his &s;ervants, he &s;aid, <HI>Lo, I am with you to the end of the world.</HI> Who is he with? the Pope? the carnal bi&s;hop? By no means. He will be with all his faithful mini&s;ters of all deno|minations, even to the end of the world. Our Lord di&s;played his power, and there was a &s;haking among the people; and tho&s;e wavering ones had their doubts removed, and drew near to the table. "It is a pity," &s;aid one, "that you ever &s;eparated from the church." It is a greater pity, &s;aid I, for the church people, &s;o called, to live without inward religion: &s;hould there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a reformation and turning to God, among your mini&s;ters and people, we &s;hall &s;tand a better chance to come together. I was brought up in the church, and have a great affection for it; and it would do me much good to hear of a turning to God among the members.</P>
<P>June 2, 1790, I &s;et out on a journey to Bo&s;ton, and &s;o round the di&s;trict. And on Tue&s;day I preached with liberty at New-Rochel&s;e, from, <HI>O my dove, who art in the cleft of the rochs,</HI> &amp;c. My greate&s;t freedom
<PB N="243" REF="023401_0242_0FBF538A149DA238">in the &s;ubject was when I inforced, <HI>let <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ee thy countenance, let me hear thy voice, for &s;weet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.</HI> Crowds attended the word. On Sunday I &s;uppo&s;e there were a thou&s;and under the word at Bedford, whil&s;t I in|forced, <HI>Friend, how came&s;t thou in hither, not having on a wedding garment?</HI> The day before, a multitude gathered in King-&s;treet; as &s;oon as I entered the hou&s;e, I &s;aw a man who was almo&s;t dead with the colic: I de|&s;ired him to drink a pint of cold water; and when he had taken it, his pain was gone. Monday 7, I cried to a li&s;tening multitude, <HI>All &s;cripture is given by in&s;pira|tion of God,</HI> &amp;c. The next day the hou&s;e was crowded, and about an hundred with|out. The people &s;eemed to drink in every word. Wedne&s;day I declared to a &s;olemn company at Sing&s;ing, <HI>Now the ju&s;t &s;hall live by faith,</HI> &amp;c. And in the evening at G. C.'s I had much freedom to preach the word. Thur&s;day 10, Oakley's church was filled from end to end. I had much &s;ati&s;|faction in explaining the fir&s;t p&s;alm. In the evening I found great freedom to de|clare, <HI>He that is born of God doth not commit &s;in, for his &s;eed remaineth in him; and he

<P>Sunday 20. About a thou&s;and met in Sharon, and I found it to be an high day.</P>
<P>Monday 21. In Cornwall I tru&s;t &s;everal were awakened; one in particular who did not re&s;t till he found peace to his &s;oul. The next day I unexpectedly met a large congregation in the Engli&s;h church in Litchfield; I found freedom in preaching from, <HI>Enoch walked with God,</HI> Gen. v. 22. I went and preached in the Pre&s;byterian meeting-hou&s;e about two miles off: and our heavenly Father has rai&s;ed us up &s;ome good friends. The next day I preached in the &s;kirts of the town, from, <HI>Whom he did foreknow,</HI> &amp;c. Here I met with trouble from a di&s;putations Antinomian; however, I went on, and preached at the hou&s;e of a

<P>Monday 28, I preached to about five hundred people in Hertford with &s;atisfac|tion. Thur&s;day July 1. After a tedious journey we came to Bo&s;ton. I preached &s;everal &s;ermons, and had no doubt but the Lord will, &s;ooner or later, give us a peo|ple in this place. From Bo&s;ton I went to Providence, and &s;taid a few days; and preached &s;everal &s;ermons with liberty. On Monday morning I preached my farewell &s;ermon a little after &s;unri&s;e, to more than two hundred people. I have great fellow|&s;hip with Mr. S. as a Chri&s;tian mini&s;ter, and &s;everal of his people, as followers of Chri&s;t; for they appeared like Methodi&s;ts to me. I have &s;ome rea&s;on to believe that my journey to this town was not in vain, for as I went out, &s;ome met me in tears de&s;iring to know what they &s;hould do to be &s;aved.</P>
<P>I again pa&s;&s;ed through Parmington, Litchfield, Cornwall, and Canaan; and was happy to conver&s;e with many new-born &s;ouls. A woman in Canaan told me, that about &s;even years ago, a man of a low &s;ta|ture
<PB N="246" REF="023401_0245_0FBF538DF642BB58">came to her one night when &s;he was a&s;leep, dre&s;&s;ed in black, and as &s;he thought &s;urrounded with a light brighter than the &s;un; he took out a book, and enquired for her name; and &s;he &s;aw him write it down in golden capitals; and told her that if &s;he was faithful in the &s;ervice of God, &s;he &s;hould have a crown of life. In the morn|ing &s;he told her hu&s;band the dream, and that &s;he &s;hould &s;urely &s;ee that man. "I went to hear every &s;trange mini&s;ter who came into the town," &s;aid &s;he, "and &s;aw not the man till you came." And &s;he knew me as well as if &s;he had been ac|quainted with me &s;even years; and no doubt but the doctrine which I preached was the light which &s;he &s;aw around me. And when &s;he went home, &s;he told her hu&s;band that &s;he had now &s;een the man.</P>
<P>I continued my journey through Hud&s;on and Queman's; from whence a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed man followed me to Albany, and under the word he found peace to his &s;oul. In Al|bany I have encountered many difficulties, in rai&s;ing a little church; which is now likely to be fini&s;hed. I held a quarterly-meeting at Cli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">-park; and from thence
<PB N="247" REF="023401_0246_0FBF5393B047D530">advanced toward the new &s;tate; and found the work increa&s;ing in mo&s;t of the &s;ocieties. I had one and &s;ometimes two quarterly meetings to attend every week; and many were encouraged to pre&s;s on in the narrow way. Having fini&s;hed my rout, in Octo|ber I returned again to New-York: where conference was held. At this conference our new Northern di&s;trict was divided; and I have continued in the Albany di&s;trict ever &s;ince. I have met with trials of a peculiar nature, part of which I once thought I never &s;hould have encountered. I wi&s;h at all times to be re&s;igned to the will of my heavenly Father&mdash;hitherto I have had an heart to ble&s;s them that cur&s;e me, and pray for tho&s;e who per&s;ecute and de&s;|pitefully u&s;e me. One thing I have taken notice of, which in &s;ome in&s;tances has been admirable. More than two thou&s;and have joined the &s;ociety&mdash;more than a thou&s;and have been really born of the Spirit&mdash;more than eight thou&s;and have been brought to &s;ee in a mea&s;ure the propriety of our doc|trine and di&s;cipline, and a reformation in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of places has taken place&mdash;hun|dreds, if not thou&s;ands, in the back &s;ettle|ments, who were not able to give an hun|dred

If you will take pains to enquire among them, at lea&s;t &s;ome can tell you that their congregations are larger; and where they had one, now they have two church members.</P>
<P>Re&s;pecting the doctrine taught among the Methodi&s;ts, I have not doubted of the truth of it, no, not for a minute &s;ince I fir&s;t embraced it. Re&s;pecting other denomina|tions, I am willing to think, and let think; but this I &s;ay, I would not have any one be of this or the other per&s;ua&s;ion merely becau&s;e their parents brought them up in that belief. Touching unconditional elec|tion and reprobation, I never did believe it; and I am per&s;uaded I never &s;hall whil&s;t I retain the u&s;e of my rea&s;on. What! to &s;uppo&s;e that the Judge of the whole earth &s;hould unconditionally from eternity, de&s;tine part of the human race to eternal flames! If any man can per&s;uade me to be|lieve it, then it will not be a hard matter to make me believe, that he has uncondi|tionally

If this in re|ality be the plan of the go&s;pel, I acknow|ledge my&s;elf to have lived to the pre&s;ent time a &s;tranger to it. I have not conver&s;|ed with any man, &s;ince I have been ac|quainted with men and things, that could be con&s;i&s;tent in &s;upporting &s;uch a doctrine. And thus it is that they &s;o often contradict them&s;elves. The holy &s;criptures have a beautiful harmony when rightly under&s;tood. God &s;poke a number of intelligences, called angels, into exi&s;tence&mdash;beings capable of u&s;ing aright, or abu&s;ing their moral agen|cy&mdash;many of them did the latter, and were ju&s;tly puni&s;hed.

And in ju&s;tice Jehovah might have puni&s;hed Adam and Eve with eternal puni&s;hment for their own actual rebellion. And as the &s;in of their po&s;terity was a &s;eminal &s;in, &s;o their puni&s;h|ment would have been a &s;eminal puni&s;h|ment.
