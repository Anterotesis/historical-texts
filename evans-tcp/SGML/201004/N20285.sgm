<HEAD><HI>SECTION I.</HI> Preliminary Ob&s;ervations on the Subject in Di&s;pute.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>REVEREND SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR <HI>Friendly Letter,</HI> which was publi&s;hed in December, 1791, I could not obtain until &s;everal months after; and have not the plea&s;ure of acknowledging your politene&s;s in &s;ending me a copy; although from an apology offered by your generous <HI>brothers,</HI> I am inclined to hope it was not a de&s;igned omi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In my other <HI>Piece</HI> I ob&s;erved, "that it was not the love of controver&s;y which induced me to write." I have the happine&s;s &s;till to believe, that this is not my greate&s;t motive. And had your arguments proved our &s;entiments and practice re&s;pecting communion, to be <HI>un&s;criptural,</HI> or <HI>in|con&s;i&s;tent</HI> with that brotherly affection which the Go&s;pel requires, I &s;hould indeed <Q>have been a gainer by the controver&s;y,</Q> and would have ac|knowledged
<PB N="4" REF="026602_0004_0FD0B5E1685CD708">my&s;elf indebte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o you for the in|&s;truction. But after I had carefully examined your arguments, I did not find the evidence &s;uf|ficient to produce conviction: therefore, am obliged in <HI>&s;incerity</HI> to abide by my former opinion.</P>
<P>Was the di&s;pute between us to be con&s;idered merely <HI>per&s;onal,</HI> and unconnected with the inter|e&s;ts of religion, I &s;hould not think my&s;elf called upon to attempt a reply. But &s;ince the honour of Chri&s;t as Head of the church, and Law-giver in his own kingdom, and the peace and tran|quillity of two denominations of Chri&s;tians are in &s;ome mea&s;ure involved in this di&s;pute, it appears to me of importance that the ground of the con|trover&s;y &s;hould be fully a&s;certained. And as you have endeavoured to lay the blame whol|ly to our denomination, I &s;hall mo&s;t cheerfully come forward with a vindication of my&s;elf and brethren.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uing my pre&s;ent de&s;ign, I &s;hall be led to remark upon &s;everal things, which are offered to con&s;ideration in your <HI>Friendly Letter.</HI> In doing of which, I hope to be governed by a &s;pirit of candour and Chri&s;tian love; and can a&s;&s;ure you, that nothing would give me more &s;en&s;ible regret, than to mi&s;conceive, or mi&s;repre&s;ent your meaning. In &s;ome in&s;tances I could have wi&s;hed that you had been more explicit, which would have relieved me from the fear of mi&s;taking you.</P>
<P>It will not be expected, that I &s;hould follow you in the exact order in which you have treated the &s;ubject; nor that I &s;hould reply to all that you have written. Some of your ob&s;ervations
<PB N="5" REF="026602_0005_0FD0B60565F65688">are agreeable to my views; and &s;ome of them appear to be unconnected with the &s;ubject in di&s;pute. To avoid prolixity, I &s;hall omit many things which might with propriety be urged in the pre&s;ent controver&s;y.</P>
<P>You have ob&s;erved, that with &s;ome degree of care you had peru&s;ed the pamphlet which I had written: if &s;o, you mu&s;t have ob&s;erved our main objections to free communion to con&s;i&s;t, e&s;&s;en|tially, in two things; <HI>viz.</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That Bapti&s;m is a divinely appointed pre-requi&s;ite to communion at the Lord's table.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That immer&s;ion upon a profe&s;&s;ion of faith is e&s;&s;ential to Go&s;pel bapti&s;m.</ITEM>
</LIST>
The fir&s;t of the&s;e I take for granted you have given up: for you ob&s;erve, (p. 9) <Q>The que&s;tion is not, whether bapti&s;m in <HI>&s;ome</HI> mode be an <HI>e&s;|&s;ential qualification;</HI></Q> you al&s;o add, (p. 13) <Q>I do not deny that bapti&s;m was <HI>prior</HI> to coming to the Lord's table in the apo&s;tolic practice. I &s;uppo&s;e it was: and I al&s;o &s;uppo&s;e their exam|ple to be worthy of imitation in like circum|&s;tances.</Q> Thus, Sir, he who is unbaptized; however amiable his character may appear, is <HI>e&s;|&s;entially di&s;qualified</HI> in your e&s;teem. In this par|ticular we &s;eem to be agreed, that bapti&s;m in <HI>&s;ome mode</HI> is e&s;&s;ential to a due qualification for the Lord's table. And I believe this to be the general &s;en&s;e of the two denominations. The other objection remains yet to be di&s;puted; which may be divided into two que&s;tions: i. e. Who are the proper <HI>&s;ubjects</HI> of bapti&s;m? And, What is the appointed <HI>mode?</HI> I have &s;aid in my other <HI>Piece,</HI> that we con&s;ider "profe&s;&s;ed believers as the <HI>only</HI> proper &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m;" and that
<PB N="6" REF="026602_0006_0FD0B5E2E57055D8">immer&s;ion is not a mere <HI>circum&s;tance,</HI> or <HI>mode</HI> of bapti&s;m, but e&s;&s;ential to the ordinance. I have not ob&s;erved in your <HI>Letter</HI> that you have di&s;|proved the&s;e &s;entiments; but what you have &s;aid in this re&s;pect, &s;hall be attended to in its place. For the pre&s;ent we &s;hall only &s;ay, that you have rai&s;ed a huge ho&s;t of <HI>&s;uppo&s;itions</HI> and <HI>con&s;equences,</HI> and brought them all again&s;t our &s;entiments, as if you were determined to frighten us out of our allegiance to the great <HI>Law-giver:</HI> but we may &s;ay as Saint <HI>Paul</HI> in another ca&s;e, <HI>None of the&s;e things move us.</HI></P>
<P>If I have rightly comprehended your rea&s;oning in favour of <HI>free</HI> communion, the mo&s;t material arguments are the following.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <Q>That the e&s;|&s;ence of bapti&s;m does not con&s;i&s;t in any one particular mode whatever.</Q> (p. 10.)</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. If it &s;hould finally appear, that you had mi&s;&s;ed the divine appointment, yet, as <Q>godly <HI>&s;incerity</HI> is the very SOUL and ESSENCE of conformity to Chri&s;t,</Q> you are therefore <Q>as well accepted in the &s;ight of God, as though <HI>your</HI> outward con|duct had been according to the appointed mode.</Q> (p. 19, 21.)</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <Q>Suppo&s;ing that the Paedo-bapti&s;ts are really in an error, if Chri&s;t does not view the error as &s;o e&s;&s;ential but that he will commune with them, why cannot you commune with tho&s;e at the table, with whom God communes?</Q> (p. 28, 29.)</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The&s;e appear to be the main pillars on which your &s;uper&s;tructure is built; and &s;hall each of them be particularly con&s;idered. Having thus &s;tated the con&s;tituent parts of the di&s;pute, we are now prepared to attend to each particular.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<PB N="7" REF="026602_0007_0FD0B606E42186E8">
<HEAD><HI>SECTION II.</HI> Profe&s;&s;ed Believers the only appointed Subjects of Bapti&s;m.</HEAD>
<P>IN your third part you ob&s;erve, <Q>The que&s;tion to be di&s;puted is &s;ummarily this: Whether, for a per&s;on to be baptized by im|mer&s;ion, after believing, be an e&s;&s;ential term of communion at the Lord's table?</Q> Of this que&s;|tion you inform your readers that I <Q>take the af|firmative &s;ide.</Q> But, my dear Sir, you have not &s;tated the que&s;tion right: that is, if you mean to have me take the affirmative. Nor will your quotations from me &s;upport &s;uch a &s;tatement. The pa&s;&s;ages quoted, and from which you make the mi&s;take, are in the&s;e words; that "bapti&s;m is to be admini&s;tered only in one mode, and to one kind of &s;ubjects." That "profe&s;&s;ed believ|ers are the <HI>only</HI> proper &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m." I &s;uppo&s;e the difference to be ea&s;ily di&s;cerned. I &s;aid "profe&s;&s;ed believers," you &s;ay <Q>to be bap|tized after believing.</Q> The former &s;uppo&s;es that a per&s;on may &s;atisfy a judgment of charity, and yet be a hypocrite: the latter, that he is in|fallibly a believer. I conclude, that a per&s;on may be baptized according to Chri&s;t's in&s;titution, and yet be a hypocrite; but he cannot be baptized in&s;titutionally, without a profe&s;&s;ion of faith. We are obliged by the Go&s;pel rule to require a pro|fe&s;&s;ion; but we are not obliged to <HI>know</HI> the <HI>&s;in|cerity</HI> of the per&s;on who makes it.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, to &s;ome the que&s;tion may appear to be the &s;ame; but it is evident that there is
<PB N="8" REF="026602_0008_0FD0B5E467047EB0">a very &s;pecific difference; and, from the wrong manner in which you have &s;tated it, you have gone on to draw fal&s;e conclu&s;ions, and to &s;addle a train of di&s;agreeable con&s;equences upon our &s;entiments, which will appear of no force, when the que&s;tion is rightly con&s;idered.</P>
<P>You inform you readers, (p. 12) that we &s;up|po&s;e, "not only that immer&s;ion is e&s;&s;ential to the ordinance of bapti&s;m, but that none are proper &s;ubjects of it but vi&s;ible believers." From this you draw the following inference: <Q>If none are proper &s;ubjects but vi&s;ible believers, none are proper &s;ubjects but real believers.</Q> You illu&s;|trate it as follows: <Q>For although a per&s;on's outwardly appearing to be a proper &s;ubject, may give him a right in the &s;ight of men, it does not in the &s;ight of God.</Q></P>
<P>You will permit me here to inquire, whether you have any other method to judge of the <HI>'real piety,'</HI> the <HI>'godly &s;incerity,'</HI> or the proper quali|fications of per&s;ons for &s;pecial ordinances, but what is vi&s;ible, or in the &s;ight of men? If you have, it is a prerogative which we do not claim. I think, Sir, the inference grants, that they have a right in the &s;ight of men; and although God may know them to be hypocrites, as he is not plea&s;ed to interpo&s;e and make the matter vi&s;ible, who will dare to challenge their right, and for|bid their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">roceeding?</P>
<P>That this ob&s;ervation may appear in its proper light, we will bring the matter upon trial; and, if you plea&s;e, we will borrow an example from the New Te&s;tament to illu&s;trate it by. In the eighth chapter of the Acts, we have an account
<PB N="9" REF="026602_0009_0FD0B608639D0508">of <HI>Philip</HI>'s vi&s;iting and preaching the Go&s;pel in <HI>Samaria,</HI> and of the happy effects which follow|ed. That a people who had long been bewitch|ed, were now reduced to rea&s;on and religion, which was the occa&s;ion of <HI>great joy in that city;</HI> and it is &s;aid, "when they believed <HI>Philip</HI> preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, they were baptized, both <HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Women.</HI>" It is al&s;o added, that <HI>Simon believed;</HI> that is, he <HI>appeared to Philip and others to believe:</HI> for we cannot &s;uppo&s;e, from the account afterwards given of him, that he was a <HI>real believer,</HI> though at this time there was nothing appeared to the contrary. Now, what was <HI>Philip</HI>'s duty in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e? It is evident that he required, as a <HI>pre-requi&s;ite</HI> in his candidates, that they <HI>believe with all the heart;</HI> as appears from another circum&s;tance recorded in the &s;ame chapter. And although <HI>Simon</HI> appeared to him to be a true believer, yet, in the &s;ight of God, he was nothing but a hypocrite.</P>
<P>It is abundantly evident, that <HI>Philip</HI> required the &s;ame qualifications, in order to bapti&s;m, that the Bapti&s;ts do at the pre&s;ent day. It is equally evident, that he baptized a per&s;on, who, in the &s;ight of God, had not tho&s;e qualifications. The pre&s;ent inquiry is, whether he did right or not? If you &s;hould choo&s;e to &s;ay, he did not act con|&s;i&s;tent with his principles; this will lead us to inquire again, what rea&s;ons could determine him in acting otherwi&s;e, as he did not know the heart of <HI>Simon?</HI> But as this an&s;wer would nece&s;&s;arily involve you in a controver&s;y with him, I &s;hall for
<PB N="10" REF="026602_0010_0FD0B5E5EFDC55A8">the pre&s;ent leave it, to be &s;ettled between you. But &s;hould you give your opinion in favour of his conduct, by whatever arguments you would vin|dicate <HI>that,</HI> the &s;ame will &s;erve to vindicate <HI>ours,</HI> under &s;imilar circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>It may be proper here to attend to the con&s;e|quences you have drawn from the preceding ob|&s;ervations; i. e. that upon our principles <Q>it <HI>may</HI> be nece&s;&s;ary to admini&s;ter the ordinance of bap|ti&s;m fifty or a hundred times to the &s;ame per|&s;on.</Q> Alarming as the&s;e con&s;equences may ap|pear to you, they do not greatly terrify us: For our <HI>principles</HI> have had a practical exi&s;tence for <HI>ages</HI> pa&s;t; and yet I can a&s;&s;ure you, I have never heard of a per&s;on's being baptized <HI>five and twenty times.</HI> Nor is it common with us to baptize a per&s;on more than once. But if we &s;hould think it nece&s;&s;ary upon any occa&s;ion to repeat it, <HI>Paedo-bapti&s;ts</HI> do even the &s;ame. <HI>Some</HI> of them have become &s;o liberal, as not only to <HI>immer&s;e,</HI> or <HI>&s;prinkle,</HI> as the candidate may choo&s;e; but, to <HI>immer&s;e</HI> tho&s;e who have been &s;prinkled in infancy, and have been members of their churches for many years!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If I am rightly informed, the Rev. Mr. P.&mdash;Pa&s;tor of a church in your vicinity, has baptized a number who had been baptized in infancy. The &s;ame has been done by the Rev. Mr. B.&mdash;of Randolph, in V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">mont. Other in&s;tances might be mentioned if nece&s;&s;ary.</NOTE> If it be nece&s;&s;ary to perform it twice, I know not but that &s;ome circum&s;tances may render it <HI>equally</HI> nece&s;&s;ary to perform it <HI>fifty times.</HI></P>
<P>But, Sir, I wi&s;h to bring the in&s;tance of <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Simon</HI> once more into view, as I think it may &s;erve to remove &s;ome of your &s;uppo&s;ed difficul|ties. It will undoubtedly be granted, that Philip
<PB N="11" REF="026602_0011_0FD0B60A18089680">baptized the <HI>&s;orcerer,</HI> upon the &s;ame footing which he did the other <HI>Samaritan</HI> converts, i. e. up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n a <HI>profe&s;&s;ion of faith.</HI> But, when <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI> came to vi&s;it the brethren at Samaria, and had laid their hands on a number, by which means the <HI>miracu|lous</HI> gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t were conferred; <HI>Si|mon</HI> beholding, was filled with a&s;toni&s;hment, and proceeded to offer them money, in order to ob|tain this power. This conduct betrayed his ig|norance of the true &s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> of religion; and expo&s;|ed him to that mo&s;t &s;evere reproof from <HI>Peter;</HI> "Thy money peri&s;h with thee,&mdash;thou ha&s;t nei|ther part nor lot in this matter: <HI>for thy heart is not right in the &s;ight of God.</HI> For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterne&s;s, and in the bond of iniquity." He was no longer to be con&s;idered as a Chri&s;tian, but under the reigning power of guilt and unbelief.</P>
<P>Now &s;hould we &s;uppo&s;e <HI>Philip</HI> to return this way again in a few weeks, and after inquiring in|to the &s;tate of his young converts, he is informed of the &s;ituation of <HI>Simon,</HI> and from the account he receives is de&s;irous of a per&s;onal interview with him:&mdash;It is agreed to,&mdash;and when the time ar|rives, <HI>Simon</HI> comes before him; blu&s;hing and confu&s;ion appear in his face, &s;hame and &s;orrow mingle in his eyes; he pau&s;es&mdash;he &s;ighs!&mdash;at length thus addre&s;&s;es the &s;weet Evangeli&s;t: "I have indeed done di&s;honour to the Chri&s;tian name, and have given ample proof to the world, that I was a &s;tranger to the power and divinity of the Go&s;pel: and although my admiration was rai&s;ed by the miracles I beheld, my pa&s;&s;ions moved and charmed by the &s;oft cloquence of
<PB N="12" REF="026602_0012_0FD0B5E776D20EC0">your per&s;ua&s;ive tongue; yet, alas! I was but in love with my&s;elf, in&s;tead of a Saviour; but <HI>my iniquity has found me out, and now appears hateful to me."</HI> He informs <HI>Philip,</HI> that the exhortation given him by the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter to repent,</HI> was &s;o accompanied with the divine energy, that he had now rea&s;on to hope that he had become a true penitent. <HI>Philip,</HI> and the church at Samaria, are fully &s;atisfied, that although <HI>Simon,</HI> when he made a profe&s;&s;ion, was <HI>in the gall of bitterne&s;s and bond of iniquity,</HI> yet that he is now become a true child of God.</P>
<P>You will permit me here in my turn to inquire, Whether <HI>Simon</HI> can now be looked upon as a <HI>vi&s;i|bly qualified</HI> member for church fellow&s;hip and communion? or whether he is to be baptized again? I do not wi&s;h to anticipate your an&s;wer; but as it is a difficulty of your own propo&s;ing, I think it rea&s;onable to give you the labouring oar; and whatever <HI>way</HI> you are plea&s;ed to decide in this ca&s;e, will undoubtedly relieve us under &s;imi|lar circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, does it not appear evident to every candid reader, that we require no more, nor any other qualifications in our candidates for bapti&s;m, than what were required in the apo&s;tolic age? They required their candidates to <HI>believe with all the heart;</HI> we require no more. There|fore, whatever con&s;equences are fairly deducible from our principles in this point, the &s;ame are equally chargeable upon theirs.</P>
<P>Agreeably to the foregoing ob&s;ervations are the &s;entiments of many Paedo-bapti&s;t writers. I will here cite the words of one. "It is manife&s;t
<PB N="13" REF="026602_0013_0FD0B60B6442E9C8">(&s;aith he) that <HI>Philip</HI>'s principles were, to bap|tize none but what had &s;aving grace, and believed with all their hearts." Al&s;o, "It is manife&s;t that the Apo&s;tles did not intend to baptize any adult per&s;ons, except they had knowledge or &s;atisfac|tion that they had the &s;eed of grace &s;own in their hearts. Witne&s;s the in&s;tance of <HI>Philip</HI>'s baptiz|ing the eunuch; again, for proof, <HI>Peter</HI>'s baptiz|ing Cornelius, and tho&s;e Gentiles that believed, after they had received the Holy Gho&s;t, as well as the believing Jews: So al&s;o the in&s;tance of the jailor's family. Not to multiply in&s;tances, it is well known, or may be well known, that faith is always &s;poken of in the word of God before bap|ti&s;m, and we all agree that bapti&s;m is to be ad|mini&s;tered to a per&s;on before the Lord's &s;upper."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Frothingham's Right to the Lord's Supper, p. 65, 66.</NOTE> If this be a ju&s;t &s;tatement of facts, that neither <HI>Philip</HI> nor the Apo&s;tles meant to baptize any adults, but tho&s;e who believed with all the heart; and that it is well known that faith is always &s;poken of in the word of God before baptizing; &s;urely the Bapti&s;ts cannot be rea&s;onably blamed, for endeavouring to imitate apo&s;tolic practice.</P>
<P>From the preceding remarks, you may proba|bly &s;ee wherein you have mi&s;taken the matter, in charging our &s;entiments with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rror re&s;pecting the qualifications of candidates for bapti&s;m. You &s;eem to &s;uppo&s;e, that becau&s;e we require them to be <HI>vi&s;ible believers,</HI> that we are obliged to know that they are <HI>real believers:</HI> This is evidently im|plied in your objection, <Q>That if none are proper &s;ubjects but vi&s;ible believers, none are proper &s;ubjects but real believers.</Q> That every man
<PB N="14" REF="026602_0014_0FD0B5E8F664A6F0">who profe&s;&s;es religion ought to be what he pro|fe&s;&s;es, no one will deny; but, that we are obliged to <HI>know</HI> them to be &s;incere, I have never yet con|ceived. Were we, for fear of the con&s;equences, to refu&s;e to admini&s;ter either the ordinance of bapti&s;m, or the Lord's &s;upper, until we ab&s;olute|ly knew who were <HI>&s;incere,</HI> I believe we &s;hould ad|mini&s;ter no more until the day of judgment.</P>
<P>But, &s;hould we allow all the con&s;equences which you have &s;uppo&s;ed to be true&mdash; (which will by no means be granted) and &s;hould we then &s;uppo&s;e again, that &s;ome imagination, more fer|tile than yours, might &s;ugge&s;t twice as many more&mdash;what then?

<P>I conclude it will not be denied; that <HI>profe&s;&s;ed believers</HI> are proper &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m: but the que&s;tion before us is, Whether they are the <HI>only</HI> proper &s;ubjects? When <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the term <HI>proper,</HI> I mean not, what is become &s;o by <HI>tradition;</HI> but what is agreeable to the in&s;titution, as recorded in the &s;acred hi&s;tory of bapti&s;m.

Second|ly, it a&s;ks, <Q>Whether that is any evidence that
<PB N="16" REF="026602_0016_0FD0B5EA7907EE08">infants were not al&s;o baptized?</Q> It will be granted that it is not po&s;itive evidence that they were not; nor is it that they were not anointed with the <HI>holy chri&s;m,</HI> or <HI>&s;igned</HI> with the &s;ign of the cro&s;s, or twenty other things done to them of which the '&s;cripture is <HI>&s;ilent.</HI>' But it is circum|&s;tantial evidence that they were not: for, that the &s;acred hi&s;torians, when recording the many in|&s;tances of the bapti&s;m of believers for the &s;pace of near &s;ixty years, until the volume of in&s;pira|tion was clo&s;ed, and never once mentioning a &s;ingle in&s;tance of an infant, mu&s;t look like a de|&s;ign again&s;t Infant-bapti&s;m, provided it was then in practice. It is not ea&s;y to account for their neglecting to <HI>record</HI> a <HI>fact,</HI> on which &s;o much de|pended, as the future peace, and order of the church of Chri&s;t.

<P>In order to bring this head to a clo&s;e, you will permit me to inquire, Whether Paedo-bapti&s;ts in general do not require, in all unbaptized adults, a per&s;onal profe&s;&s;ion of faith, in order to their be|ing admitted to the ordinance of bapti&s;m? That they do, will appear from their own te&s;timony. "Bapti&s;m is not to be admini&s;tered to any that

<P>Shall I add to this another, from a late advo|cate for Infant-bapti&s;m, who has complained much of the Bapti&s;ts for their <HI>"a&s;&s;uming"</HI> language, in calling the bapti&s;m admini&s;tered by them, by way of di&s;tinction, <HI>"Believers' Bapti&s;m."</HI> "Whereas, (&s;aith he) there is no other bapti&s;m admini&s;tered in our churches but the bapti&s;m of believers, or tho&s;e who are accounted &s;uch, either upon their per|&s;onal profe&s;&s;ion, or in the repute of the church, and God's gracious acceptation.

<P>This gentleman, from the general manner of his expre&s;&s;ions, mu&s;t be under&s;tood to repre&s;ent the whole denomination; and evidently carries the matter quite as far as we do. If a <HI>profe&s;&s;ion of faith</HI> be the only terms on which you admit adults to bapti&s;m; if, after this, they &s;hould prove their profe&s;&s;ion to be fal&s;e, you are as much obliged to baptize them <HI>'fifty times,'</HI> in order to be con&s;i&s;t|ent upon your &s;entiments, as we are upon ours. The &s;tronge&s;t <HI>terms</HI> you have quoted from me are, "That none are proper &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m but <HI>profe&s;&s;ed believers.</HI>" We have ju&s;t heard, that there is "no other bapti&s;m admini&s;tered in your churches, but the bapti&s;m of believers:" not will it relieve the matter for any to &s;ay that it is added, "or tho&s;e who are accounted &s;uch upon their per&s;onal profe&s;&s;ion." This is all that we
<PB N="18" REF="026602_0018_0FD0B5EBF4D87910">contend for as an&s;wering the rule: for we do not pretend ab&s;olutely to know, that tho&s;e whom, we baptize are <HI>real believers,</HI> only we account them &s;uch upon their per&s;onal profe&s;&s;ion. Nor can it be con&s;idered as an exception what is fur|ther added, That they are believers. "in the re|pute of the church:" for no church could con|&s;i&s;tently <HI>repute</HI> a per&s;on to be a believer, without rational evidence, that he was &s;uch. But the la&s;t, expre&s;&s;ion &s;eems to carry the matter to a degree of certainty; That they are believers in "God's gracious acceptation:" for although per&s;ons may profe&s;s, and churches may account them to be believers; yet certainly God, as he cannot be deceived, will not <HI>accept</HI> any as &s;uch but tho&s;e who are &s;o in reality.</P>
<P>We will next take notice of that very &s;criptur|al account given by Dr. <HI>Hopkins.</HI> When de&s;crib|ing the &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m, he &s;ays, "The proper &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m, if adult, are tho&s;e who, by profe&s;&s;ion and appearance, are believers in Chri&s;t and true friends to him. None but they who are really &s;uch, do in heart <HI>put on Chri&s;t:</HI> They mu&s;t therefore be really holy, in order to put on this vi&s;ibility and profe&s;&s;ion of it, with propriety and truth, which they do in bapti&s;m: for if they be not really &s;uch, they are utterly unquali|fied in the &s;ight of God, to be admitted to bap|ti&s;m, as it is, on their part, only a piece of hypoc|ri&s;y. Therefore none are to be admitted to this ordinance, but tho&s;e who, in the view of the church, appear to be true friends to Chri&s;t or be|lievers in him, and really holy, and are ju&s;tly con&s;idered by them as &s;uch; who can judge only
<PB N="19" REF="026602_0019_0FD0B60FE6602478">by outward appearance, and cannot certainly know the heart.</P>
<P>"That none but &s;uch, who are thus vi&s;ibly, and in the charitable judgment of the church, and of tho&s;e who admini&s;ter this ordinance, be|lievers in Chri&s;t and really holy, are the proper &s;ubjects of this ordinance, and to be admitted to bapti&s;m, <HI>is abundantly evident from &s;cripture,</HI> as well as from the nature of the tran&s;action, and the rea&s;on of things. The Apo&s;tles, when they fir&s;t began to admini&s;ter Chri&s;tian bapti&s;m, and form a church, baptized none but &s;uch who <HI>gladly received the word.</HI> When the eunuch de&s;ired to be baptized, <HI>Philip</HI> &s;aid, <HI>If thou believ|e&s;t with all thine heart, thou maye&s;t.</HI> This implies that he was not qualified for bapti&s;m, or a fit &s;ubject of that ordinance, unle&s;s he were a true believer in Chri&s;t: and that he could not baptize him, unle&s;s he profe&s;&s;ed and appeared to be &s;uch a believer. Hence all who were baptized, and formed into churches, were con&s;idered and ad|dre&s;&s;ed by the Apo&s;tles, in their letters to them, an &s;aints for holy per&s;ons, believers in Chri&s;t, and friends to him; as tho&s;e who were &s;aved, and heirs of eternal life; or, which is the &s;ame, as real Chri&s;tians: of which every one mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, who reads the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, and their epi&s;tles."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sy&s;tem of Divinity, Part II.

<P>If indeed it be evident from &s;cripture, and in the charitable judgment of the church, "That none but &s;uch, who are thus vi&s;ibly believers in Chri&s;t, and really holy, are the proper &s;ubjects of

For had the gentleman but now quot|ed, been giving a narrative of the <HI>&s;entiments</HI> and <HI>practice</HI> of the Bapti&s;t churches at the pre&s;ent day, he could not have given an account di&s;|&s;imilar, without contradicting &s;ober fact. If it &s;hould be objected to what has new been &s;aid, that the preceding is only an account of the true qualifications of adults, it will be readily grant|ed; and at the &s;ame time a&s;&s;erted, that the Bible knows but of one kind of qualifications in can|didates for bapti&s;m; it knows nothing of <HI>higher</HI> and <HI>lower,</HI> of <HI>po&s;itive</HI> and <HI>negative</HI> qualifications.</P>
<P>"Neither the Forerunner, nor the Apo&s;tles of Chri&s;t have &s;aid any thing on which &s;uch a di&s;|tinction can be founded; as they in&s;i&s;ted on re|pentance and faith as nece&s;&s;ary in order to ac|ceptance with God, and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, &s;o they in&s;i&s;ted upon the <HI>profe&s;&s;ion</HI> of them, in order to their being admitted into the <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> kingdom or church of CHRIST.

"In a word, from the whole tenor of the New Te&s;ta|ment, it is plain, that nothing le&s;s or lower than

<P>You have endeavoured to evade part of the &s;cripture evidence in favour of immer&s;ion, by &s;ugge&s;ting that the bapti&s;m admini&s;tered by <HI>John</HI> was not <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> bapti&s;m. Your objections are the following. You &s;ay, <Q>We have no rea|&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that <HI>John</HI> baptized in all re&s;pects agreeable to the Chri&s;tian <HI>mode</HI> of bapti&s;m:</Q> But why not?

<P><PB N="23" REF="026602_0023_0FD0B612E54CC460">
It appears evident that the que&s;tion did not re&s;pect the <HI>ordinary influences,</HI> or <HI>name</HI> of the Ho|ly Gho&s;t: for, they could not be believers with|out the <HI>former,</HI> nor <HI>John</HI>'s di&s;ciples without hav|ing heard of the <HI>latter.

<P>You &s;eem to think that the&s;e di&s;ciples were re-baptized by <HI>Paul</HI> in the Chri&s;tian mode; but did you ob&s;erve, Sir, that the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> is not mentioned in the form of admini&s;tration here re|corded?

That the reader may not con&s;ider us to be par|tial in the explanation now given, I would ob|&s;erve that many eminent Paedo-bapti&s;ts have un|der&s;tood it in the &s;ame light which we do.

<P>In perfect agreement with this are the &s;enti|ments or Mr. <HI>Poole, "When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Je&s;us;</HI> that is, the di&s;ciples, or tho&s;e that <HI>John</HI> preached to, who, when they heard what the Bapti&s;t &s;aid in the foregoing ver&s;e, were baptized." "As for <HI>Paul</HI>'s impo&s;ing his hands upon them who are &s;aid to be baptized, it might very well be: That the twelve di&s;ciples might have been baptized by <HI>John,</HI> and now receive the Holy Gho&s;t in the&s;e extraordinary gifts by the laying on of the hands of St. <HI>Paul:</HI> For to what end &s;hould the&s;e di&s;|ciples, who had been baptized with St. <HI>John</HI>'s bapti&s;m, be again baptized by <HI>Paul?</HI>" He fur|ther adds, "It is evident that the Apo&s;tles them|&s;elves were only baptized with the bapti&s;m of <HI>John,</HI> for there were none el&s;e to baptize them."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vid.

<P>Now as <HI>John</HI> had come baptizing with water, in a way different from all the requirements of the ceremonial law, and by an authority un|known to them, they rea&s;onably concluded that he mu&s;t be <HI>one</HI> or the <HI>other</HI> of tho&s;e per&s;ons they were looking for.</P>

I wi&s;h to add two pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, as fully confirming the above ob&s;ervations. The fir&s;t is <HI>Luke</HI> xvi. 16. <HI>The law and the prophets were un|til John: &s;ince that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man pre&s;&s;eth into it.</HI> This ob|&s;ervation made by Chri&s;t, cannot rea&s;onably be referred to <HI>John's birth</HI> or <HI>death;</HI> but evidently re&s;pects the beginning of his mini&s;try: for then he began to preach the kingdom of God, and to proclaim the advent of the Saviour; and men in multitudes flocked to this new di&s;pen&s;ation, call|ed the kingdom of God. The other pa&s;&s;age is, <HI>Mark</HI> i. 1&mdash;4. THE BEGINNING OF THE GOS|PEL OF JESUS CHRIST <HI>the Son of God: As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I &s;end my me&s;|&s;enger before thy face, which &s;hall prepare thy way before thee. The voice of one crying in the wilder|ne&s;s, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths &s;traight.

<P>Thus, Sir, the Evangeli&s;t here calls <HI>John</HI>'s min|i&s;try <HI>The beginning of the go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> But you inform your readers, that it was under, or belonged to the Jewi&s;h di&s;pen&s;ation. It will now be le&s;t to the impartial to judge, whether, for the &s;ake of &s;upporting a particular hypothe&s;is, you have not erred from the truth. And although you conclude that every 'candid inquirer' mu&s;t view the matter in the &s;ame light which you do, it is very po&s;&s;ible that &s;ome who are entitled to that character, may differ from you.</P>
<P>But, Sir, you have left your readers &s;till under one difficulty re&s;pecting the matter. As you deny
<PB N="29" REF="026602_0029_0FD0B6178007C830">that <HI>John's mini&s;iry</HI> belonged to the Chri&s;tian di&s;|pen&s;ation, you have not informed them when that begun. From the analogy of your rea&s;oning, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e you begin it at the death of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>You will now permit me to inquire, whether the bapti&s;m admini&s;tered by the Apo&s;tles of Chri&s;t before his death was Jewi&s;h bapti&s;m? Or, which di&s;pen&s;ation it belonged to? Or, whether to nei|ther? It is &s;aid, <HI>John</HI> iii. 22&mdash;24, <HI>After the&s;e things' came Je&s;us and his di&s;ciples into the land of Judea; and there he tarried with them, and bap|tized. And John al&s;o was baptizing in Enon, near to Salim, becau&s;e there was</HI> MUCH <HI>water there:&mdash; For John was not yet ca&s;t into pri&s;on.</HI> The Phari|&s;ees al&s;o heard <HI>that Je&s;us made and baptized more di&s;ciples than John, (though Je&s;us him&s;elf baptized not, but his di&s;ciples.)</HI> This bapti&s;m was cotem|porary with <HI>John</HI>'s, and undoubtedly under the &s;ame di&s;pen&s;ation.</P>
<P>But will Chri&s;tians in general be willing to al|low, that both <HI>Je&s;us</HI> and <HI>John</HI> were mini&s;ters of the legal di&s;pen&s;ation? And that the ordinances in&s;tituted, and admini&s;tered by them, belonged to that di&s;pen&s;ation? I &s;aid <HI>ordinances:</HI> for, if bap|ti&s;m is to be con&s;idered in this light, undoubtedly the &s;acred Supper is to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ewed upon the &s;ame footing; for, this was in&s;tituted and admini&s;tered by Chri&s;t before his death, and never in&s;tituted by him afterwards.</P>
<P>As Chri&s;t was the &s;ame divine per&s;on before his death, that he was after he aro&s;e, it was by his ap|pointment and authority, that his di&s;ciples were &s;ent to <HI>teach</HI> and <HI>baptize.</HI> They did not re|ceive their commi&s;&s;ion from the chief prie&s;ts, but
<PB N="30" REF="026602_0030_0FD0B5F51C9D0AF0">from JESUS. And <HI>John</HI>'s preaching, and bap|ti&s;m, were as independent of the Jewi&s;h di&s;pen&s;a|tion, as that of the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>The authority by which <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI> acted, both in preaching and baptizing, is expre&s;sly de|clared by the Evangeli&s;t <HI>John,</HI> chap. i. ver&s;e 6. <HI>There was a man &s;ent from God, who&s;e name was John.

<P>The Jewi&s;h rulers knew nothing of <HI>John</HI>'s bap|ti&s;m as belonging to their di&s;pen&s;ation; you know nothing of its belonging to the Chri&s;tian, and perhaps it might puzzle you both, to determine whether it w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <HI>from heaven or of men!</HI></P>
<P>Upon the whole, if the bapti&s;m admini&s;tered by <HI>John,</HI> as <HI>the beginning of the go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and that which was admini&s;tered by the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, by his authority, and in his pre&s;ence, were not <HI>Chri&s;tian bapti&s;m,</HI> we know of none which is de&s;erving of the name.</P>
<P>I have been more particular upon this point, becau&s;e modern writers lay &s;o much &s;tre&s;s upon it. But it really appears, that to con&s;ider <HI>John</HI>'s mini&s;|try as a part of the Jewi&s;h di&s;pen&s;ation, is both un|&s;criptural, and prejudicial to the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of religion.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="026602_0031_0FD0B618E504F590">
Finally, &s;hould it even be &s;uppo&s;ed, that there could be a di&s;tinction made between the bapti&s;m of <HI>John</HI> and the Chri&s;tian in&s;titution, re&s;pecting the form of words u&s;ed in the admini&s;tration, it would by no means affect the ca&s;e before us. For you will plea&s;e to remember that the di&s;pute is not about the <HI>form</HI> of words; but the <HI>act</HI> of baptizing. Hence if <HI>Mahomet</HI> had written his Koran in Greek, and had ordered his di&s;ciples to be baptized in his name; and had expre&s;&s;ed the act by the &s;ame <HI>Greek verb</HI> by which Chri&s;tian bapti&s;m is expre&s;&s;|ed; &s;hould we not rea&s;onably conclude that they baptized in the &s;ame mode which Chri&s;tians did, notwith&s;tanding the difference of <HI>&s;aith</HI> and <HI>names</HI> into which they were baptized? Let candour judge, and I will abide the deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>Therefore until you, or &s;ome other per&s;on, &s;hall prove that <HI>John</HI>'s mini&s;try belonged to the Jewi&s;h di&s;pen&s;ation, we &s;hall confide in the judg|ment of the Evangeli&s;t, that it was <HI>the beginning of the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation.</HI> And con&s;equently the <HI>manner</HI> of <HI>John</HI>'s baptizing, may be con&s;i&s;tently urged to e&s;tabli&s;h the <HI>mode</HI> of Chri&s;tian bapti&s;m.</P>

<P>BAPTISM, like man in his prime|val &s;tate, when it fir&s;t came out of the hand of its in&s;titutor, was pure. But it has been ba&s;ely contaminated, and perverted from its original de|&s;ign,

<P>It is evident, Sir, that you and I differ, both in opinion and practice, re&s;pecting the <HI>mode of bapti&s;m.</HI> I have ventured to &s;ay in my other Piece, that "bapti&s;m is to be admini&s;tered only in one mode," and that "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mmer&s;ion is e&s;&s;ential to the ordinance." You have given it as your opinion, (p. 10) <Q>That the <HI>e&s;&s;ence</HI> of <HI>bapti&s;m</HI> does not con&s;i&s;t in any one particular mode what|ever;</Q> and that <Q>it may be acceptably perform|ed either by <HI>&s;prinkling,</HI> by <HI>pouring on water,</HI> or by <HI>immer&s;ion.</HI> In the following page you add, It may be &s;crupled whether you, or any other man, can a&s;certain preci&s;ely the apo&s;tolic mode of bapti&s;m.</Q> If this be indeed the ca&s;e, then we may undoubtedly do as the children of I&s;rael did when they had <HI>no king, every man what is right in his own eyes.</HI></P>
<P>But, whether the &s;ubject be involved in &s;o much uncertainty as you &s;ugge&s;t, is worthy of &s;erious inquiry. We cannot &s;uppo&s;e you to be confident with regard to your own mode, nor that you will attempt to prove it to be apo&s;tolic; unle&s;s you mean to empha&s;ize the adverb <Q><HI>pre|ci&s;ely,</HI></Q> and include in it all tho&s;e trivial circum|&s;tances you have mentioned (p. 10): Such as whether <Q>the &s;ubjects were put into the water backward or forward, or what length of time they kept them under water, or at what time they called the name of the Trinity over them,</Q> &amp;c.

<P>It is worthy of ob&s;ervation, that the Paedo|bapti&s;t writers in this controver&s;y rarely, if over, mention the bapti&s;m admini&s;tered by <HI>John,</HI> un|le&s;s in &s;ome negative &s;en&s;e, or to an&s;wer &s;ome ar|guments drawn from it again&s;t their &s;entiments. But the wa&s;hing of Jewi&s;h pro&s;elytes is frequent|ly mentioned, as an indi&s;putable auxiliary to In|fant-bapti&s;m, by many noted writers on that &s;ide.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dr. Lightfoot, Dr. Wall, Dr. Lathrop of We&s;t-Springfield, and others; but &s;crupled by the learned Dr. Ben&s;on, and po&s;itively de|nied by others.</NOTE></P>
<P>A que&s;tion here naturally &s;ugge&s;ts it&s;elf to the mind; Why do Paedo-bapti&s;ts go back to Jewi&s;h tradition, or forward to the death of the Saviour, in order to a&s;certain the origin of go&s;pel bapti&s;m, and cautiou&s;ly omit the fir&s;t accounts given of it in the &s;acred hi&s;tory? Perhaps the mo&s;t natural an&s;wer is, becau&s;e <HI>that</HI> appears incongruous with their practice. It will require a large &s;tock of art and ingenuity, to per&s;uade a candid inquirer that <HI>John</HI> baptized any be&s;ide <HI>aduits,</HI> or admini&s;|tered the ordinance in any other way than by <HI>im|mer&s;ion.</HI> The particular places which he cho&s;e for the conveniency of baptizing, mu&s;t afford a &s;trong argument in favour of immer&s;ion; nor can there be a very rational account given of his conduct upon any other footing. Had <HI>John</HI> ad|mini&s;tered in the pre&s;ent popular mode, I pre|&s;ume a &s;ingle ca&s;k of water would have been &s;uf|ficient for all he ever baptized!&mdash;and in whatever
<PB N="38" REF="026602_0038_0FD0B5FAE55F7588">place people had lived, there could have been no want of water &s;ufficient to baptize.</P>
<P>In order to evade the force of this argument, many things have been &s;aid. One time we are told, that Jordan was &s;o &s;hallow that there was not a &s;ufficient depth of water to immer&s;e, or bury a per&s;on in; again, that the large quantity of water was nece&s;&s;ary, for the people and their bea&s;ts to drink; again, when <HI>John</HI> baptized in Enon <HI>becau&s;e</HI> there was <HI>much water</HI> there, we are told that (<GAP DESC="foreign"> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John iii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">3.</NOTE>) <HI>many waters,</HI> means many little &s;prings, not &s;ufficient to immer&s;e in. Now as to the fir&s;t of the&s;e, no per&s;on who is ac|quainted with that ancient geographical account drawn by the pen of in&s;piration, can po&s;&s;ibly be|lieve it. If any are at a lo&s;s, let them ob&s;erve, that it was only fordable at particular places, as appears by <HI>Ehud, Gideon</HI> and the <HI>Gileadites</HI> tak|ing tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Judges iii. 28. vii. 24. xii. 6.</NOTE> And al&s;o <HI>David</HI>'s cro&s;&s;ing it with his family in a ferry-boat.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Sam. xix. 15&mdash;18.</NOTE> As to the &s;econd ob&s;ervation, if there was much water, it was nece&s;&s;ary to "&s;upply the multitudes that came to <HI>John</HI>'s bapti&s;m, for drink for them&s;elves, and their hor&s;es and camels."<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Clark's Defence of infant Bapti&s;m, p. 436.</NOTE> If <HI>John</HI>'s preach|ing had been &s;uch, that it had broken up the city of Jeru&s;alem, and collected all the people from the region round about, and they had all gather|ed to him in one day, yet &s;till it would not be true, that they needed a river half as large as Jor|dan to have &s;upplied them all with drink; unle&s;s they drank like <HI>Job's behemoth!</HI><NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Job. xl. 23.</NOTE> I do not re|member ever to have heard, that when any large

<P>The fact appears to be this, that <HI>John</HI>'s mini|&s;try continued for a con&s;iderable time, and that the people from time to time went out to hear him, and often we may &s;uppo&s;e he had crowded a&s;&s;emblies. It is &s;aid he preached in the <HI>wilder|ne&s;s of Judea,</HI> but he baptized <HI>in Jordan.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus mentioned the places cho&s;en by <HI>John,</HI> we &s;hall next take notice of the place where <HI>Philip</HI> baptized the eunuch, which you &s;uppo&s;e to be a matter of nece&s;&s;ity rather than choice; be that as it may, the account informs us,&mdash;<HI>they came unto a certain water;</HI>&mdash;&s;uppo&s;ed by Mr. <HI>Poole</HI> to be a fountain in a town called <HI>Beth&s;ora,</HI> or a river called <HI>Eleutherus,</HI> which in that road mu&s;t be pa&s;s|ed over.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pol. in loc.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Jerom</HI> de&s;cribes the town of <HI>Beth&s;oron,</HI> and men|tions the fountain in it, in which he &s;aith, "the Acts of the Apo&s;tles relate, that the eunuch of queen <HI>Candaece</HI> was baptized here by <HI>Philip,</HI>"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">De locis Hebraicis, Fol 89.6.</NOTE></P>

<P>Thus we have traced <HI>John</HI> and his candidates, and <HI>Philip</HI> and the eunuch, to the water-&s;ide; we are now prepared to con&s;ider the con&s;equent ac|tion. It is &s;aid of <HI>John</HI> that the people who went out to him, <HI>were baptized of him</HI> IN <HI>Jordan.&mdash; And Je&s;us, when he was baptized, went up &s;traight|way</HI> OUT OF THE WATER.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matt. iii. 6, 16. Mark 1.9.</NOTE> It is added by <HI>Mark&mdash;And it came to pa&s;s in tho&s;e days, that Je|&s;us come from Galilee, and was baptized of John</HI> IN <HI>Jordan, and &s;traightway</HI> COMING UP OUT OF THE WATER.

<P>Now, Sir, can any per&s;on compare the&s;e ac|counts for a moment, and not &s;ee the manife&s;t agreement in the <HI>action</HI> of <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Philip.</HI> Let the rite be performed in what mode &s;oever, it is evident it was the <HI>&s;ame</HI> in the people whom <HI>John</HI> baptized, and in the Saviour, and in the eunuch. You ob&s;erve in this la&s;t in&s;tance, there is <Q>no account of any particular mode whatever.</Q> I mu&s;t take the liberty here, again to di&s;&s;ent from you: for, I conclude it is a very particular ac|count of the mode of plunging. Were you to be informed by a per&s;on of your acquaintance, that he &s;aw a mini&s;ter who was a &s;tranger to him, go down into the water with a candidate, and that he baptized him, and that they came up out
<PB N="41" REF="026602_0041_0FD0B62085848D48">of the water,&mdash;I am per&s;uaded, without he&s;ita|tion, you would conclude that they were Bapti&s;ts; and the account here given would decide the point in your mind, and perhaps in any other per&s;on's, in what <HI>mode</HI> the ordinance was admin|i&s;tered. Again, if in&s;tead of &s;aying they went down both into the water, it had been &s;aid that the candidate a&s;cended, or was carried up the pulpit &s;tairs, (which is now the cu&s;tom in many places) it would afford a &s;trong pre&s;umption in favour of affu&s;ion.</P>
<P>You ob&s;erve the in&s;tance abovementioned is the only one, <Q>recorded in &s;cripture, of going to a river, pond, pool, or brook, to baptize with Chri&s;tian bapti&s;m.</Q> Sir, you will plea&s;e al&s;o to ob&s;erve, that this is the only in&s;tance recorded, after the death of the Saviour, in which the <HI>act</HI> of baptizing is de&s;cribed; and here it evidently de|&s;cribes immer&s;ion.</P>
<P>But you &s;ay, <Q>If we admit, according to out tran&s;lation, that they both of them went down <HI>into</HI> the water, this is no evidence that either of them were plunged all under water. You will not &s;uppo&s;e, that this text is a proof that <HI>Philip</HI> went all under water. But why not? If going into the water proves immer&s;ion, it proves that <HI>both</HI> were immer&s;ed; for they went down both into the water.</Q> To &s;ome of your readers, this critici&s;m does not appear in the mo&s;t logical light; for no per&s;on ever &s;uppo&s;ed, that for <HI>Philip</HI> and the <HI>eunuch</HI> to go into the water up to the <HI>knees</HI> or <HI>loins,</HI> would be to immer&s;e either; but when they had got into the water, there was evi|dently &s;omething done to one, that was not to
<PB N="42" REF="026602_0042_0FD0B5FDE7739FE8">the other; i. e. <HI>Philip</HI> baptized or <HI>immer&s;ed</HI> the eunuch; but <HI>he</HI> did not baptize <HI>Philip.</HI> There|fore for the &s;ake of immer&s;ing the eunuch, they went both into the water, as that could not be con&s;i&s;tently performed without. In this light their going <HI>into the water</HI> will appear rational; but in every other view, totally incon&s;i&s;tent. Had the object been only to <HI>&s;prinkle</HI> the eunuch, this could have been performed at the water &s;ide, without going down into it; yea, probably it might have been done decently in the chariot: for it is mo&s;t rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that a per&s;on of his di&s;tinction and equipage would not travel that de&s;ert country, without &s;ome ve&s;&s;els to ob|tain and convey water, when he came to it; un|le&s;s he meant to &s;erve him&s;elf in the way that <HI>Gideon</HI>'s men did.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, does it not appear to be the mo&s;t ea&s;y and natural con&s;truction of the pa&s;&s;age, to &s;uppo&s;e the bapti&s;m of the eunuch to be an immer&s;ion? I might here, if nece&s;&s;ary, produce a cloud of witne&s;&s;es from Paedo-bapti&s;t expo&s;i|tors, full to my purpo&s;e; but I omit them for the pre&s;ent. And although I would not addre&s;s you in that full &s;train of a&s;&s;urance, which the great Apo&s;tle did king Agrippa, yet I may mod|e&s;tly inquire, <HI>Believe&s;t thou not the&s;e things thy&s;elf? yea, I doubt not but thou believe&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>You take notice of this as a &s;ingle in&s;tance, in which Chri&s;tian bapti&s;m has the <HI>appearance</HI> of im|mer&s;ion. But, Sir, would you think it rea&s;ona|ble, that in every in&s;tance where it is &s;aid that per&s;ons <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aptized, that all the circum&s;tances relating to the <HI>act</HI> &s;hould be particularly de&s;crib|ed?
<PB N="43" REF="026602_0043_0FD0B621E4E7C8D0">Surely you could not. You might as rea|&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e, that where <HI>circumci&s;ion</HI> is mention|ed, and the <HI>act</HI> not formally de&s;cribed, that it was performed upon a different part, or in a different way from what the in&s;titution pointed out, as, that bapti&s;m was admini&s;tered in a <HI>different mode</HI> from the &s;pecimens given of it.</P>
<P>It may be profitable here to reflect upon the &s;ubject a moment, and put a few circum&s;tances together, which may afford &s;ome light in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e.</P>
<P>When <HI>John,</HI> that bright morning &s;tar, appear|ed, to give knowledge of &s;alvation, he came to prepare the way, and proclaim the approach of the Sun of righteou&s;ne&s;s. In order to this, he came preaching repentance for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, and baptizing with (or <HI>in</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The prepo&s;ition <HI>to</HI> might perhaps be better rendered <HI>in,</HI> as it is Matt. xii. 41. and many other places.</NOTE>) water. The manner in which <HI>John</HI> baptized is &s;o particularly de&s;cribed, that very few Chri&s;tians, of any de|nomination, have doubted its being by immer|&s;ion. This was the beginning of the in&s;titution; therefore it was proper to de&s;cribe it. The act was performed in Jordan. But, as the Bapti&s;t had informed the people, that there would come one after him mightier than he, who &s;hould bap|tize with the Holy Gho&s;t and fire,&mdash;therefore, to avoid the danger of a mi&s;take which might po&s;&s;i|bly be made from this, in &s;uppo&s;ing that Chri&s;t, when he came, would introduce a different <HI>mode</HI> of bapti&s;m from what <HI>John</HI> practi&s;ed,&mdash;we are expre&s;sly told, not only that he was baptized by <HI>John,</HI> but that it was admini&s;tered in the &s;ame
<PB N="44" REF="026602_0044_0FD0B5FF9AC78B88">way to him, as to the people. He, al&s;o, <HI>was baptized in Jordan, and came up &s;traightway out of it.</HI></P>
<P>After Je&s;us had pa&s;&s;ed in triumph through the dark domains of death, he came to his di&s;ciples ve&s;ted with all power in heaven and earth, and enlarged their commi&s;&s;ion, and &s;ent them to preach to Gentiles as well as Jews; with an ex|pre&s;s command, to baptize in the name of the triune God. Now, le&s;t we &s;hould look for &s;oma alteration in the mode of bapti&s;m, it is again ex|emplified, and here we &s;ee it to be the &s;ame as be|fore; <HI>Philip</HI> and the candidate go down into the water, he is baptized, and they come up again out of it. Thus we &s;ee the bapti&s;m admini&s;tered by <HI>John,</HI> in the beginning of the Chri&s;tian di&s;pen|&s;ation, before Chri&s;t began his per&s;onal mini&s;try; and that admini&s;tered to Chri&s;t him&s;elf; and that admini&s;tered after he gave the great commi&s;&s;ion, as to the <HI>mode,</HI> were uniformly the &s;ame.</P>
<P>From this, we think it r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ional to conclude, that tho&s;e in&s;tances of bapti&s;m mentioned in the New Te&s;tament, where the act is not de&s;cribed, were performed in the &s;ame manner as tho&s;e were of which an account is given.</P>
<P>Incompetent as this evidence may appear to you, we think it a &s;ufficient an&s;wer to your que&s;|tion, wherein you a&s;k by what authority we make immer&s;ion e&s;&s;ential to bapti&s;m, &amp;c. I would al|&s;o a&s;&s;ure you, that whenever you will make out as much proof from &s;cripture for <HI>&s;prinkling,</HI> as being an in&s;tituted mode of bapti&s;m, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> has now been produced in favour of <HI>immer&s;ion,</HI> I will lay down my pen, and for ever drop the di&s;pute.</P>

Although what has been offered may be con|&s;idered as ample proof of the que&s;tion in di&s;pute, yet being de&s;irous of giving you full &s;atisfaction, I &s;hall proceed to lay before you one con&s;ideration more, which appears to us of con&s;iderable weight in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e; and that is, the native &s;ig|nification of the <HI>Greek</HI> verb, (<GAP DESC="foreign">) <HI>to baptize,</HI> which we &s;uppo&s;e nece&s;&s;arily requires dipping. We are fully &s;en&s;ible at the &s;ame time, that this &s;en&s;e has been controverted by many men of emi|nent abilities; notwith&s;tanding, we think the evi|dence greatly preponderates in our favour.

<P>You will undoubtedly recollect, that the fir&s;t in&s;tances to be met with in ancient hi&s;tory, where|in they pretended to baptize otherwi&s;e than by immer&s;ion, were in ca&s;es of &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>nece&s;&s;ity;</HI> and con&s;idered even in tho&s;e ca&s;es as not fully an&s;wering the in&s;titution.</P>
<P>The baptizing of <HI>&s;ick</HI> or <HI>dying</HI> per&s;ons by affu|&s;ion, originated in the third century<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Robin&s;on's Hi&s;t. p. 449.</NOTE> (a period fruitful of religious inventions) and had its found|dation in error.</P>
<P>Several things united in bringing it into ex|i&s;tence: as 1.

Another &s;entiment equally erroneous aro&s;e, from a mi&s;application of the words of Chri&s;t &mdash;<HI>Except a man be born of water, and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</HI> Thus on the one hand, they fearing a fatal relap&s;e after bapti&s;m, and on the other, (as Dr. <HI>Cave.</HI> ob&s;erves) "Not daring to pa&s;s into another world without this <HI>badge</HI> of their initiation into Chri&s;t,&mdash;they pre&s;|ently &s;ignified their earne&s;t de&s;ire to be baptized, which was accordingly done, as well as the circum|&s;tances of a &s;ick bed would permit.

<P>It appears that <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> was brought to be|lieve the Chri&s;tian doctrine in the beginning of his reign, which continued upwards of thirty years; but he was not baptized until a little before his death.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was proclaimed Emperor in the 1&s;t year of the 271 Olym|piad, or A.

In an|&s;wer to this, the reader is de&s;ired to call to mind what has already been &s;aid, that &s;prinkling fir&s;t made its appearance in <HI>Africa,</HI> in the third century, in favour of <HI>Clinicks</HI> or bed-ridden peo|ple. But even African Catholics derided it, and reputed it no bapti&s;m, or at lea&s;t a very imperfect one.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jo. Andreae Bo&s;ii de clinicis exercit. Hi&s;t.

Sprinkling in the&s;e ca&s;es, appears to have been in u&s;e &s;everal centuries before pouring was ever practi&s;ed for bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t appearance of baptizing by <HI>pouring,</HI> (which has occurred in my reading) was in the eighth century; when Pope Stephen III. allow|ed the validity of &s;uch a bapti&s;m of infants in danger of death.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion propo&s;ed to him was, Whether in <HI>ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity</HI> occa&s;ioned by illne&s;s of an infant, it were lawful to baptize by <HI>pouring</HI> water out of the hand, or a cup, on the head of the infant? <HI>Stephen</HI> an&s;wered, if &s;uch a bapti&s;m were perform|ed, in &s;uch a ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, in the name of the holy Trinity, it &s;hould be held valid.</P>
<P>The learned <HI>Ba&s;nage</HI> makes &s;everal remarks on the canon of <HI>Stephen,</HI> referred to above. "Al|though (&s;aith he) it is accounted the fir&s;t law for &s;prinkling, yet it doth not forbid dipping: that it allows &s;prinkling, only in ca&s;es of imminent danger: that the authenticity of it is denied by &s;ome Catholics: that many laws were made after this time in Germany, France, and England, to

And that it was not until five hundred and fifty-&s;even years after, that the legi&s;lature, in a coun|cil at <HI>Ravena,</HI> in the year thirteen hundred and eleven, declared <HI>dipping,</HI> or <HI>&s;prinkling indifferent.</HI>"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jacobi Ba&s;nagii, Monument.

<P>There was indeed in &s;ome parts of the Chri&s;t|ian church, long before this, &s;uch a ceremony as <HI>pouring</HI> water upon the head, but was di&s;tinct from bapti&s;m, and like exorci&s;m con&s;idered only as a preparation. This pouring was called <HI>capitulavi|um,</HI> or wa&s;hing of the head; and was u&s;ually per|formed on Palm-Sunday upon the competents, as a preparatory to bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>If hi&s;tory can e&s;tabli&s;h any fact, it undoubtedly does this. that bapti&s;m was univer&s;ally admini&s;|tered by <HI>immer&s;ion</HI> in the whole Chri&s;tian church (except in ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity as above) for thirteen hundred years together; and continued &s;o in the Engli&s;h nation until about the middle of the &s;ixteenth century. And how the change was made in the Engli&s;h church, we are &s;ufficiently informed by Dr. <HI>Wall. "Calvin</HI> (&s;aith he) was, I think, the fir&s;t in the world, that drew up a form of liturgy, that pre&s;cribed <HI>pouring water</HI> on the infant, ab&s;olutely without &s;aying any thing of <HI>dipping</HI> (this was done in the year 1556.) It was his admirers in England, who in queen Elizabeth's time, brought pouring into ordinary u&s;e, which before was u&s;ed only to weak children. But the &s;ucceeding <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> in

<P>I wi&s;h to add one remark more from Dr. <HI>Wall</HI> under this head. "There has (&s;aith he) no nov|elty or alteration, that I know of, in point of bap|ti&s;m, been brought into our church, but in the <HI>way</HI> or <HI>manner</HI> of admini&s;tering it. The way that is now ordinarily u&s;ed, we cannot deny to have been a novelty, brought into this church by tho&s;e that learned it in Germany, or at Geneva. And they were not content to follow the exam|ple of pouring a quantity of water, (which had <HI>there</HI> been introduced in&s;tead of immer&s;ion) but improved it (if I may &s;o abu&s;e that word) from pouring to &s;prinkling; that it might have as lit|tle re&s;emblance of the ancient way of baptizing as po&s;&s;ible."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 403, 404.</NOTE></P>
<P>This indefatigable hi&s;torian has a&s;&s;igned two rea&s;ons for this alteration, which are as follow; "I mu&s;t own in the fir&s;t place, that many of the clergy &s;eem to be of the opinion of the late bi&s;h|op of <HI>Sali&s;bury,</HI> That the coldne&s;s of our climate is a good rea&s;on to change <HI>dipping</HI> into <HI>pouring.</HI>" Upon which he ob&s;erves, "That our climate is no colder than it was for tho&s;e thirteen or fourteen hundred years from the beginning of Chri&s;tianity here, to queen Elizabeth's time, and not near &s;o cold as <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> and &s;ome other coun|tries, where they do &s;till <HI>dip</HI> their children in bap|ti&s;m,

<P>It is &s;aid by an Engli&s;h hi&s;torian, that at <HI>Peter&s;burgh</HI> they &s;ometimes baptize their children in a river or canal, by cutting a hole through the ice; upon which he ob&s;erves, "I have heard that a prie&s;t, in im|mer&s;ing a child, (for bapti&s;m, is performed by the immer&s;ion of the whole body) let it &s;lip, through inattention, into the water.

That "It was not the coldne&s;s of the climate, but the imitation of <HI>Calvin</HI> and the church at <HI>Geneva,</HI> and &s;ome others thereabouts."</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, from the ob&s;ervations now made, we clearly &s;ee what was the practice of the ancient Chri&s;tians; and how the alteration has been brought about.

<HEAD><HI>SECTION VI.</HI> Godly Sincerity, as connected with external Obe|dience, con&s;idered.</HEAD>
<P>IN my other Piece I have a few times u&s;ed the term <HI>&s;incere,</HI> and its &s;ub&s;tantive <HI>&s;incerity.</HI> I have &s;aid, that "&s;incerity is not the term of communion, but being conformed to the Apo&s;|tles' doctrine, and continuing &s;tedfa&s;tly therein. I have al&s;o &s;aid, that "whatever we practi&s;e which is not according to the will of Chri&s;t, is contra|ry thereto; although we be ever &s;o &s;incere in do|ing it." To this you reply, <Q>If I rightly con|jecture, it exhibits a &s;entiment which is fal&s;e in its nature, pernicious in its con&s;equences, and a fir&s;t principle of your mi&s;take re&s;pecting clo&s;e communion.</Q> Sir, if your <HI>conjecture</HI> be right, we are now in a fair way to get at the root of the difficulty. You however acknowledge the fir&s;t part of the &s;entence. "that whatever we practi&s;e which is not according to the will of Chri&s;t, is contrary thereto:" This, you &s;ay, <Q>is very plain and good doctrine;</Q> but when I added, although we be <HI>ever &s;o &s;incere,</HI> you &s;ay, I pre&s;ent a difficul|ty. Really, Sir, it appears to me as you con&s;true the pa&s;&s;age, it pre&s;ents a much greater difficulty: for, if an act were really di&s;agreeable to the will of Chri&s;t, and our performing it in &s;incerity would render it agreeable, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e his will to be dependent on the &s;incerity of his creatures; if &s;o, his will cannot be a rule of conduct for us, but we mu&s;t be governed by our own &s;incerity.</P>
<P>That we may not di&s;pute about words rather than &s;entiments, it may be proper here to &s;ettle
<PB N="65" REF="026602_0065_0FD0B65924A0D0D8">the meaning of the term <HI>&s;incere.</HI> You allow that <Q>the word is ambiguous in the cu&s;tomary u&s;e of it;</Q> but conclude, <Q>as it is u&s;ed in &s;crip|ture, it generally, if not invariably, implies or intends pure and upright affections of heart.</Q> That it is u&s;ed in this &s;en&s;e in the epi&s;tle to the Philippians, will be granted; but, that it is u&s;ed in &s;omewhat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f a different &s;en&s;e by the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter,</HI> mu&s;t al&s;o be acknowledged: For he &s;peaks of the <HI>&s;ince e milk of the word,</HI> which being of the neuter gender, does not include affections of any kind. The&s;e two, are perhaps the only in&s;tances in &s;cripture, in which this adjective is u&s;ed, ex|cept in the marginal reading.</P>
<P>But &s;hould it even be granted that the word, when u&s;ed in &s;cripture, is con&s;tantly u&s;ed in the &s;en&s;e for which you plead; will you hence argue that I am obliged to u&s;e it in this &s;en&s;e? Have I not a right to u&s;e it according to common ac|ceptation? Surely I have not mentioned <HI>godly,</HI> or <HI>&s;cripture &s;incerity.</HI> I have indeed annexed the adverb <HI>ever,</HI> to &s;incere; which you are plea&s;ed to &s;ay, <Q>extends to all kinds and to all degrees of &s;incerity.</Q> But have you, by the fair rules of critici&s;m, a right to this conclu&s;ion? Mo&s;t cer|tainly yoy have not. It will be allowed, that the term u&s;ed will extend to the highe&s;t degree; but by no means determines the kind or quality of &s;incerity.</P>
<P>Should you agree to meet a friend to-morrow evening at eight o'clock, and &s;hould &s;ay, <Q>I will not fail of being there although it &s;hould be <HI>ever</HI> &s;o dark</Q>&mdash;It might with as much proprie|ty be argued, that <HI>this</HI> included all kinds of dark|ne&s;s,
<PB N="66" REF="026602_0066_0FD0B633F5089D48">natural, preternatural, moral and &s;piritual; as, that <HI>ever</HI> &s;o &s;incere includes all kinds of &s;in|cerity.</P>
<P>To prevent any mi&s;take in future, I am wil|ling to let you know how I under&s;tand the word, and how I wi&s;h to be under&s;tood when I u&s;e it. The plain, natural &s;ignification of the word ap|pears to be this&mdash;<HI>The hone&s;t per&s;ua&s;ion of the mind, according to the degree of light in the under&s;tanding;</HI> and in general is to be under&s;tood in di&s;tinction from hypocri&s;y. Thus, a man may be a &s;incere friend to the Federal Con&s;titution. He may be a good man in a <HI>moral</HI> &s;en&s;e, and yet his &s;incere attachment to the laws of his country, may be the effect of his political &s;entiments, rather, than his piety. Another man may &s;incerely believe the xxxix articles of the Church of England, and as &s;incerely believe that all the Di&s;&s;enters are wrong. I &s;hall not pretend to &s;ay that this is godly &s;incerity, or that it is not; but I will ven|ture to &s;ay he may be a good man, and this may be his &s;incere opinion.</P>
<P>In farther remarking upon this part of the &s;ubject you &s;ay, <Q>Your words imply, that a per|&s;on may, in the exerci&s;e of godly &s;incerity, act contrary to the will of Chri&s;t.</Q> In order to make a &s;atisfactory reply to this, is will be proper to inquire what is meant by the will of Chri&s;t.&mdash;When I u&s;e the term, I mean his WILL <HI>reveal|ed in his word:</HI> For I know nothing of his will farther than he has therein made it known. It is a general maxim with Prote&s;tants, that the word of God is a perfect rule of faith and prac|tice. Therefore, to talk of things as being agree|able
<PB N="67" REF="026602_0067_0FD0B65A2E356050">or di&s;agreeable to the will of Chri&s;t, in any other &s;en&s;e than as they are approved or di&s;ap|proved by the <HI>word</HI> of God, is to talk merely up|on the footing of conjecture. Hence, Sir, if you under&s;tand the will of Chri&s;t in this &s;en&s;e, I free|ly acknowledge it to be my opinion, that a good man may &s;incerely act contrary to it. You may call this <HI>godly &s;incerity,</HI> or by any other name that your plea&s;e.</P>
<P>If good men cannot be &s;incerely wrong, or in other words, &s;incerely erroneous, then all their errors and mi&s;takes, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as agree|able to the will of Chri&s;t; or otherwi&s;e, as acts of criminal hypocri&s;y! But you a&s;k, <Q>Is not godly &s;incerity the very <HI>&s;oul</HI> and <HI>e&s;&s;ence</HI> of <HI>con|formity</HI> to Chri&s;t?</Q> I an&s;wer, it is impo&s;&s;ible to conform to the <HI>will</HI> of Chri&s;t without &s;incerity, or uprightne&s;s of heart; but mere &s;incerity is by no means conformity to Chri&s;t's will, with re|&s;pect to po&s;itive in&s;titutions. It can only be con&s;idered as a nece&s;&s;ary qualification for con|formity. Unden the Mo&s;aic economy, a lamb for &s;acrifice mu&s;t be without blemi&s;h; but the perfection of the lamb did not make it a &s;acri|fice, this only rendered it &s;uitable; but it was its being actually offered up. So with regard to our obeying any po&s;itive precept, &s;incerity is ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to acceptable obedience. A man may be convinced that it is his duty to re|lieve a needy brother; and al&s;o &s;incerely deter|mine at a convenient &s;ea&s;on to do it; yet cer|tain circum&s;tances may take place, &s;o as finally to prevent its being accompli&s;hed. That God may approve of his <HI>&s;incere intention,</HI> will not be
<PB N="68" REF="026602_0068_0FD0B635D88607C8">di&s;puted; but we can have fellow&s;hip in his char|ity no farther than we <HI>know</HI> it, which is only by his acting it out. It will be granted that Chri&s;t judges the moral qualities of our actions by the intentions of the heart; but he has not given this as a rule to us, any farther than it di&s;covers it&s;elf in the action. Chri&s;t pronounces the man guilty of adultery, who looks on a woman crimi|nally to lu&s;t after her; but we have no right, ei|ther by the laws of God or man, to charge any per&s;on with that crime, without the actual com|mi&s;&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>I conclude, that a good man may, in one pe|riod of its, <HI>&s;incerely</HI> believe that he is acting ac|cording to the will of Chri&s;t, and at another, as &s;incerely believe that what he then did, was never commanded, or enjoined by Chri&s;t; but was the mere effect of education or tradition.</P>
<P>Nothing can bring the matter more familiar|ly into view, than the &s;ubject now in di&s;pute.&mdash;We will &s;uppo&s;e, that in the &s;incerity of your heart, you have de&s;ired to open a door for free communion with &s;ome of the Bapti&s;ts; and as <Q><HI>&s;incerity</HI> is the very e&s;&s;ence of conformity to Chri&s;t,</Q> we mu&s;t conclude, in this particular you act agreeably to his will. On the other hand, the Bapti&s;ts to whom you make the friendly pro|po&s;al, <HI>as &s;incerely</HI> believe, that it is not according to the will of Chri&s;t, that they &s;hould commu|nicate with you in your pre&s;ent &s;ituation. This al&s;o contains the e&s;&s;ence of conformity to Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, if I under&s;tand your argument, this mu&s;t be the conclu&s;ion; that it is the <HI>will</HI> of Chri&s;t, that the Paedo-bapti&s;ts &s;hould communi|cate
<PB N="69" REF="026602_0069_0FD0B65BA78E09A0">with the Bapti&s;ts; and at the &s;ame time, it is his <HI>will,</HI> that the Bapti&s;ts &s;hould not commu|nicate with them! I &s;hall take it for granted, that the Bapti&s;ts do in the <HI>&s;incerity</HI> of their hearts, refu&s;e to communicate with tho&s;e whom they look upon as not baptized according to Chri&s;t's in&s;titution. If this <HI>refu&s;al</HI> be made with <HI>godly &s;incerity,</HI> (and who will dare to &s;ay it is not) then according to your argument, it mu&s;t be <Q>above every thing el&s;e plea&s;ing to Chri&s;t;</Q> equally &s;o, as communicating with other denominations at the table.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate your doctrine of <HI>&s;incerity</HI> you a&s;k, <Q>Would it be according to the will of Chri&s;t, for a per&s;on to conform to your mode of bapti&s;m, while he really thinks it would be contrary to the will of Chri&s;t for him &s;o to do?</Q> To an|&s;wer this, it will be nece&s;&s;ary fir&s;t to inquire, whe|ther the mode of bapti&s;m practi&s;ed by us, is ac|cording to Chri&s;t's revealed will? If not, nei|ther our <HI>thinking,</HI> or <HI>not</HI> thinking, can po&s;&s;ibly make it &s;o. If it be according to his will, our thinking otherwi&s;e cannot alter it, unle&s;s his will is entirely dependent on the opinion of his crea|tures.</P>
<P>Again, you a&s;k, <Q>Would it be according to the will of Chri&s;t, for a per&s;on to <HI>neglect</HI> to have his children baptized in <HI>our</HI> mode, while he real|ly thinks it is the will of Chri&s;t for him thus to bring them to the ordinance?</Q> <HI>An&s;wer.</HI> If Chri&s;t has any where declared it to be his will, that new-born infants &s;hould be dedicated to him, by <HI>&s;prinkling</HI> water upon them in the name of the &s;acred Trinity, it can by no means be

<P>As you have put your <HI>theory</HI> of <HI>&s;incerity</HI> upon trial, in &s;ome of the foregoing in&s;tances, we are willing to compare the matter a little farther.

Hence it follows, that it is the will of Chri&s;t, that one part of his church &s;hould imitate HIS bapti&s;m IN <HI>Jordan,</HI> by being im|mer&s;ed; and that another part &s;hould believe, that <HI>the bapti&s;m of Je&s;us Chri&s;t is not to be imitat|ed by Chri&s;tians.</HI> That one branch of his church &s;hould give up their children to him <HI>in bapti&s;m,</HI> and thereby initiate them into the &s;chool of the &s;acred my&s;teries, without their knowledge or con|&s;ent, at a period of life when they are incapable of acting for them&s;elves; and that another part of his church &s;hould, from <HI>principle,</HI> neglect the

<P>To illu&s;trate the doctrine of <HI>&s;incerity</HI> now un|der con&s;ideration, you introduce the following &s;imile. <Q>A phy&s;ician may, in certian circum|&s;tances,

Yea, would he not be in the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e criminal to do it? To apply this figure. Admitting, that with benevolent intention, you have propo&s;ed free communion with us, yet if we really believe it to be incon|&s;i&s;tant with &s;ome part of Chri&s;t's revealed will, we cannot with the <HI>&s;ame</HI> purity of intention comply.</P>
<P>But it is time to attend to the application you make from the above ob&s;ervations.

<P>Is it rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that God would make appointments for his people which he did not think proper for them to ob&s;erve? Or has he left di&s;cretionary orders with any man, or any body of men, to &s;et a&s;ide, alter, or amend any of his po&s;itive in&s;titutions?

For, if God has thought fit to appoint the mode, and de&s;cribe the &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m; and a Paedo-bapti&s;t may offer <HI>&s;ubjects</HI> e&s;&s;entially dif|ferent from tho&s;e de&s;cribed in the in&s;titution, and that in a mode quite unlike the divine ap|pointment, and yet be <HI>'as well accepted,'</HI> as though he had ob&s;erved the mo&s;t exact conform|ity

<P>You acknowledge, (p. 27) that <Q>integrity of heart does not render the judgment infallible, with re&s;pect to a&s;certaining the will of God.</Q>&mdash; This indeed appears to me to be true; but why then do you blame me for &s;uppo&s;ing a per&s;on with godly &s;incerity, may act contrary to the will of Chri&s;t?

As to the pernicious con&s;equences which you have di&s;covered in it, I may have overlooked them; probably, becau&s;e they are not &s;o high
<PB N="77" REF="026602_0077_0FD0B660E55D46F0">coloured as the charge. But what pernicious con&s;equences can we imagine from our conform|ity to the Apo&s;tles' doctrine, and &s;tedfa&s;t contin|uance in it?&mdash;Or from following the plain di|rections in God's word, rather than our own &s;ancied notion of <HI>&s;incere obedience,</HI> without exter|nal conformity?

<P>Another in&s;tance &s;till more to our purpo&s;e, pre&s;ents us in the &s;acred page. When the wick|ed &s;ons of <HI>Eli</HI> were &s;lain by the Phili&s;tines, they took the ark of the God of I&s;rael, and carried it into the temple of their idol.

<PB N="80" REF="026602_0080_0FD0B63E64962660">drawn by two milk-kine.

<P>This ark by divine appointment was to be borne by the prie&s;ts, by the &s;taves which went through the rings of it. But as the in&s;tituted mode might appear rather inconvenient at this time, they might think the one adopted by the Phili&s;tines would do as well. And as they might call to mind, that "God delighted more in mercy than in &s;acrifice;" both <HI>David</HI> and his people very <HI>&s;incerely</HI> concluded, that it would do to carry it in a decent <HI>new cart.</HI> But the way being rough, and the oxen unaccu&s;tomed to this hallowed bu|&s;ine&s;s, &s;o agitated the &s;acred ark, that <HI>Uzzah</HI> put forth his hand and took hold of it. <HI>And the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|ger of the Lord was kindled again&s;t Uzzah, and God &s;mote him there for his</HI> ERROR, <HI>and there he died by the ark.</HI></P>
<P>What there was, either in the conduct or di&s;po|&s;ition of <HI>Uzzah,</HI> which was &s;o offen&s;ive to the Di|vine Being, as to mark him out as a monument of &s;acred di&s;plea&s;ure, is perhaps unknown to mortals. It is evident that <HI>David</HI> did not di&s;cover, any criminality in the conduct of <HI>Uzzah;</HI> for if he had, he would not have been di&s;plea&s;ed becau&s;e the Lord made a breach upon him.

<P>This alarming providence checked their pious joy, and put a &s;udden period to all their tuneful numbers. An awful fear of the great Jehovah was now impre&s;&s;ed upon their minds.&mdash;Silent, and &s;ol|lemn, they retire and leave the ark without the city!</P>
<P>Will any per&s;on &s;ay that <HI>David</HI> did not go in the <HI>&s;incerity</HI> of his heart? Let tho&s;e who deny it, make out the proof.</P>
<P>It may perhaps be difficult for us to di&s;cover any real difference in the <HI>de&s;ign,</HI> or <HI>&s;incerity,</HI> of <HI>David</HI> and his people at this time, or three months after, when they brought up the ark into the city of <HI>David</HI> with &s;houting.

Their <HI>departing</HI> from the in&s;tituted way, (however &s;incere) drew on them God's di&s;|plea&s;ure. Their <HI>obedience</HI> to it obtained his ap|probation.

The que&s;tion now is, whether it were agreeable to the will of Chri&s;t for <HI>John</HI> to wor&s;hip the angel? It is evident he thought it to be his duty; and his conduct has every ap|pearance of <HI>&s;incerity.</HI> Allowing <HI>John</HI> to be <HI>&s;incere,</HI> and his conduct in this particular in&s;tance agree|able to the will of Chri&s;t, then the above men|tioned prohibition mu&s;t be under&s;tood condition|ally. "It is written, thou &s;hall wor&s;hip the Lord thy God, and him <HI>only</HI> &s;halt thou &s;erve;" <HI>unle&s;s thou &s;halt &s;incerely think it duty to wor&s;hip a crea|ture.</HI> If it were not agreeable to the will of Chri&s;t that <HI>John</HI> &s;hould wor&s;hip the angel, then it nece&s;|&s;arity follows, that a good per&s;on may, in the ex|cerci&s;e of <HI>&s;incerity,</HI> act contrary to his will.</P>
<P>If, to evade the force of this argument, you &s;hould &s;ay, <Q>Although <HI>John</HI> &s;incerely thought it to be his duty to wor&s;hip the angel, yet he was undoubtedly mi&s;taken,</Q> this it to give up the argument: for we have always been willing to allow, that Chri&s;tians may be <HI>&s;incere,</HI> and yet be mi&s;taken as to the will of Chri&s;t. That this was the ca&s;e, with either <HI>John</HI> or the <HI>angel,</HI> is abund|antly evident. And in order to &s;ave your argu|ment from falling, it appears nece&s;&s;ary to be pro|ved, either that it was agreeable to the will of Chri&s;t for <HI>John</HI> to wor&s;hip the angel; or, that he was in|&s;incere in attempting it. Until one or the other is made out, we &s;hall conclude he <HI>&s;incerely</HI> at|tempted to do that, which was expre&s;sly forbid|den in the revealed will of God.

<PB N="88" REF="026602_0088_0FD0B644A7C749E0">But, Sir, is the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e no morality in good and bad purpo&s;es? You &s;eem to convert them neither to one or the other, but to a &s;tate of indifferency.

If we are rational agents (and we certainly are) whatever mode of external conduct we pur&s;ue, mu&s;t be our choice, rather than any other; and how this can be without morality, I am totally at a lo&s;s.</P>
<P>I conclude, Sir, that you will allow that eating bread and drinking wine, are external acts; but if there be no morality in them, it is hardly worth while to wa&s;te our time in a di&s;pute about &s;uch trifling things. I do not conclude, however, that the morality of the act is merely in ma&s;ti|cating bread, or in &s;wallowing wine, which a brute may do as well as an intelligent agent; but the circum&s;tances which lead us to choo&s;e and adopt this particular mode of conduct, undoubt|edly tinge the <HI>act</HI> with morality.</P>
<P>Your other ob&s;ervation which I &s;hall take no|tice of, is the following, that <Q>There is nothing of a moral nature in <HI>mere &s;entiments</HI> or <HI>mere ex|ternals.</HI></Q> If by 'mere <HI>&s;entiments,</HI>' you mean no more, than tho&s;e fugitive thoughts which flutter upon the &s;urface of the brain, as <HI>butterflies</HI> do in the &s;un-beams, we &s;hall not contend. But, if by <HI>&s;entiment,</HI> we under&s;tand that re&s;ult of the mind which leads us on to <HI>external</HI> acts, we &s;hall undoubtedly find that it is connected with the
<PB N="89" REF="026602_0089_0FD0B66B19E97BE0">heart, as well as the head. <HI>The fool hath &s;aid,</HI> not in his head, but <HI>in his heart, there is no God.</HI> This is his &s;entiment, and a very innocent one it is, if de&s;titute of morality!</P>
<P>You will permit me to add a remark from a ve|ry &s;entimental writer. Saith he, "Error in judg|ment and &s;entiment, e&s;pecially in things of a moral nature, is always wrong; and does not con|u&s;t or originate merely in any defect of the moral faculties of the mind; but is of a moral nature, in which the ta&s;te, affection, or inclination of the heart is concerned; and therefore is always, in ev|ery degree of it, morally wrong, and more or le&s;s criminal. Were the moral faculties of the mind, were the heart, perfectly right, man would not be capable of error, or of judging wrong, or making any mi&s;take e&s;pecially in things of religion. The natural faculties of the mind, con&s;idered as &s;epa|rate from the inclination or will, do not lead, and have no tendency in them&s;elves, to judge wrong, or contrary to the truth of things. To do &s;o, is to judge without evidence, and contrary to it, which the mind never would or could do, were not the inclination or heart concerned in it, &s;o as to have influence, which mu&s;t be a wrong incli|nation, and contrary to truth and to evidence; and therefore is morally wrong or criminal."</P>
<P>"Therefore, all the mi&s;takes and wrong opin|ions which men entertain re&s;pecting the <HI>doctrines, in&s;titutions</HI> and <HI>duties</HI> revealed in the bible, are criminal, and of a bad tendency."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hopkins's Sy&s;t.

<P><PB N="90" REF="026602_0090_0FD0B645E68E29B8">
I conclude that the bible exhibits a fair &s;y&s;tem of truth, &s;upported by rational evidence; and were it not for the blindne&s;s of the human <HI>heart,</HI> and the prejudices occa&s;ioned by <HI>&s;inful affections,</HI> men would yield their cheerful a&s;&s;ent to truth, in exact proportion to the evidence laid before them; and would not <HI>choo&s;e darkne&s;s rather than light.</HI> It is believed that good men, (however they may differ in opinion here) in the coming &s;tate, will &s;ee eye to eye: perhaps not owing &s;o much to the &s;uperior light of truth, as to their being de|livered from tho&s;e &s;inful affections which oppo&s;e the truth. This ob&s;ervation will appear evident from this con&s;ideration, that tho&s;e who have the greate&s;t advantages to know the truth, often ap|pear to be mo&s;t oppo&s;ed to it. The Jews, who had the oracles of God, and con&s;equently the be&s;t information re&s;pecting the Me&s;&s;iah, when he was preached to them, oppo&s;ed and bla&s;phemed, while the Gentiles believed.</P>
<P>Upon &s;uppo&s;ition, that <Q>there is nothing of a <HI>moral nature</HI> in mere &s;entiments,</Q> why is <HI>unbe|lief</HI> a crime? or why is a man to blame for being an <HI>infidel?</HI> this is a mere &s;entiment. In &s;hort, why do we blame the Jews for accu&s;ing and de|livering Chri&s;t to be crucified? It is evident they did not believe him to be the Son of God. The Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter,</HI> after charging them with killing the Prince of Life, &s;aid to them; <HI>Now brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it,</HI> as did al&s;o your rulers.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Act<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> III. 17</NOTE> Saint <HI>Paul</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed that they did not know him to be the Me&s;&s;iah: for, &s;aid he, <HI>None of the princes of this world knew it:</HI> for had

And their <HI>external conduct</HI> was to put him to death. Now where was their crimi|nality? You will probably &s;ay it originated in their hearts, <Q>where all real criminality is to be found.</Q> It will be granted. And did not their &s;entiments originate there likewi&s;e? Out of the HEART proceed evil thoughts, murders, &amp;c. and not out of the head as unconnected with it.</P>
<P>In order to apply the foregoing ob&s;ervations to the &s;ubject before us, we are willing to acknow|ledge, that we do not think a man to blame, for &s;incerely acting according to his con&s;cience, al|though it be ever &s;o erroneous. But he may be exceedingly to blame, for having an erroneous con&s;cience. If we do not improve the be&s;t means of information which we are favoured with, we are certainly to blame for the neglect.</P>
<P>It is a maxim in civil law, "That a man is obliged to know it at his peril." This holds good with regard to the divine law. The man who tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the law of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> through igno|rance, however &s;incere, was neverthele&s;s guilty; and when it came to his knowledge he was oblig|ed to offer a &s;acrifice.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I. cv. iv. 13, 22, 27.</NOTE> And he who killed his neighbour at unawares, without in the lea&s;t de|&s;igning his death, was neverthele&s;s doomed to &s;uffer a certain puni&s;hment; for, to be confined

<P>Upon the whole, what rea&s;on can be given for our con&s;truing the divine law differently? Or why &s;hould one man &s;ee a revealed truth, and another under equal advantages &s;hould not; un|le&s;s the latter be under the influence of moral blindne&s;s? If the po&s;itive in&s;titutions of the go&s;|pel are &s;ufficiently plain (as they undoubtedly are) why &s;hould we read and under&s;tand the &s;ame bible &s;o very differently? I cannot think we are both right. If Chri&s;t has commanded his peo|ple to dedicate their infant-&s;eed to him in bap|ti&s;m, then we mu&s;t conclude that all the Bap|ti&s;t churches are in an error in this particular. On the other hand, if the go&s;pel teacheth us, that with the <HI>heart</HI> man believeth unto righteou&s;ne&s;s, and with the <HI>mouth confe&s;&s;ion</HI> is made unto &s;alva|tion; and that this confe&s;&s;ion is to be made by every candidate for bapti&s;m; then we mu&s;t &s;up|po&s;e our Paedo-bapti&s;t brethren are in an error, in not in&s;i&s;ting upon the &s;ame vi&s;ible qualifications which the Apo&s;tles did. In &s;hort, can it be &s;up|po&s;ed that the &s;ame divine law, which enjoins ei|ther the <HI>one</HI> or the <HI>other,</HI> can approve of the neg|lect? If not, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily follow, that if you are right, we are wrong; and &s;o <HI>vice ver&s;a.</HI></P>
<P>But it is often &s;aid by our opponents, "We are willing to acknowledge your bapti&s;m to be valid, and why cannot you be as <HI>liberal</HI> with re|&s;pect to ours?" We are &s;orry to bear the charge of illiberality; but had much rather do it than

When per&s;ons are &s;o liberal, as to be willing to divide and mangle an in&s;titution of Chri&s;t, in order to accommodate a painful di&s;pute; while <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;eems to &s;how a con|de&s;cending temper in them, it at the fame time excites a &s;u&s;picion of the <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> of their <HI>cau&s;e.</HI> This kind of liberality of &s;entiment naturally leads us to recollect an in&s;tance recorded in an|cient hi&s;tory, concerning two women who came to a certain king, to decide a controver&s;y between them re&s;pecting a <HI>living</HI> child. Each contended that &s;he was the <HI>true mother,</HI> and that the child was her's. For a time, their claims appeared equal|ly well founded, until at length the wi&s;e king cal|led for a &s;word, and propo&s;ed to divide the living child, and give half to the one and half to the other! The woman who&s;e the child was, could by no means con&s;ent; but would either have it alive undivided, or el&s;e give it up &s;o to the other: <HI>but the other &s;aid, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it.</HI> To have divided the child, would have de&s;troyed its exi&s;tence: So to divide an in|&s;titution of Chri&s;t, is to make it mean any thing, and every thing, and con&s;equently nothing. For when a divine law is &s;uppo&s;ed to be condition|al, and is to be left to the judgment or fancies of men to determine, whether one mode of obe|dience be not as acceptable as another, it of cour&s;e lo&s;es its authority, and cea&s;es to be a law</P>
<P>From the above argument it will not be con|cluded, that one man has a right to dictate, or pre&s;cribe a mode of obedience for another: for to our <HI>own Mafler we &s;tand or fall.</HI> Neverthe|le&s;s, the divine law is not conditional, but ab&s;o|lute;
<PB N="94" REF="026602_0094_0FD0B64A2359D1E8">and its requirements mu&s;t be fixed and de|terminate, although we may not under&s;tand them. ONE LAW <HI>&s;hall be to him that is home born, and unto the &s;tranger that &s;ojourneth among you.</HI></P>
<P>To conclude this Section, dear Sir, I wi&s;h you &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider your arguments upon &s;incer|ity, whether you have not carried the matter too far; and whether they are not calculated in &s;ome in&s;tances, to di&s;&s;erve the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t, and to &s;trengthen the hands of error. For admitting that either you or we are in an error with re&s;pect to one of the in&s;titutions of Chri&s;t, yet as your &s;entiments a&s;&s;ure us, that if we &s;incerely think we are right, <Q>We are as well accepted in the &s;ight of God, as if our external conduct had been according to his appointments,</Q> &s;hall we not be apt to relea&s;e our&s;elves from a painful in|quiry into the evidences for, and again&s;t our particular &s;entiments; and conclude to &s;lide &s;moothly on, in the good old way which our fa|thers went; and perhaps, have no higher rea&s;on to believe it to be right, than becau&s;e <HI>they</HI> be|lived it to be &s;o?</P>
<P>It is often &s;aid, "When we get to heaven, we &s;hall not be a&s;ked what particular principles we were of." This objection implies too great an indifferency to the requirements of <HI>truth;</HI> and leads us to &s;uppo&s;e that many determine to get to heaven as cheap as they can. And whenever per&s;ons would wi&s;h a relea&s;e from the toil of in|quiry, and expen&s;e of retraction, they may im|prove your argument as a cordial auxiliary.</P>
<P>But were we even to grant <HI>&s;incerity</HI> to be a term of communion, yet &s;hould we not be obliged to
<PB N="95" REF="026602_0095_0FD0B66DA5C670D0">fix upon &s;ome external acts of obedience, as evi|dential of &s;incerity? Or are we to judge a man to be &s;incere by the looks of his face? Or by the tincture of his thoughts? Or are we to believe it becau&s;e he profe&s;&s;es to be &s;incere? Perhaps the man was never yet found propagating any &s;enti|ment of religion whatever, who would own him&s;elf in&s;incere.</P>
<P>If <HI>&s;incerity</HI> be the only thing &s;ought for, and agreement in &s;entiment unnece&s;&s;ary to Chri&s;tian fellow&s;hip, then we may open the door wide, and receive all who appear to be &s;incere, however erroneous, and by whatever names di&s;tingui&s;hed, whereever they appear &s;incere.</P>
<P>Perhaps there is no one act in the circle of Chri&s;tian duty, which expre&s;&s;es more fellow&s;hip, than communicating at the Lord's table. And if we can occa&s;ionally communicate together, why can we not &s;tatedly? We &s;hall al&s;o be led farther to inquire, upon what principle is &s;epara|tion to be ju&s;tified? Why did the Prote&s;tants come out from the church of Rome? There were undoubtedly many &s;incere Chri&s;tians in that church, notwith&s;tanding the body of clergy might be thought to be corrupt. Why did the di&s;&s;ent|ers leave the church of England, and the inde|pendents the pre&s;byterians, and the&s;e di&s;&s;ent one from another? It would be uncharitable to &s;up|po&s;e, that there were not many &s;incere Chri&s;tians in tho&s;e churches. Objections &s;imilar to tho&s;e now mentioned have in fact taken place.</P>
<P>When <HI>pre&s;byteriani&s;m</HI> was about to be e&s;tab|li&s;hed by the Briti&s;h government, the a&s;&s;embly of divines at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> appointed a committee to
<PB N="96" REF="026602_0096_0FD0B64B24D6A230">hear and an&s;wer the petition of tho&s;e who &s;hould not conform to the government.</P>
<P>To the&s;e the independents pre&s;ented their reque&s;t, Dec. 4, 1645, which was only this: "That they may not be forced to communicate as members in tho&s;e pari&s;hes where they dwell; but may have liberty to have congregations of &s;uch per&s;ons who give good te&s;timony of their god|line&s;s, and yet out of a tenderne&s;s of con&s;cience cannot communicate in their pari&s;hes, but do voluntarily offer them&s;elves to join in &s;uch con|gregations."</P>
<P>To this the a&s;&s;embly gave a flat denial, Dec. 15. The <HI>independents,</HI> unwilling to lo&s;e the privileges of the e&s;tabli&s;hment, made the following conce&s;|&s;ion. "That they would maintain occa&s;ional communion in their churches." But &s;till their pre&s;byterian brethren would not allow them &s;ep|arate congregations. They rather improved this compliance, to &s;trengthen their arguments again&s;t granting &s;uch liberty. "If (&s;ay they) they may occa&s;ionally exerci&s;e the&s;e acts of communion with us once, a &s;econd, or a third time, without &s;in; we know no rea&s;on why it may not be ordinarily without &s;in, and then &s;eparation and church-gath|ering would have been needle&s;s. To &s;eparate from tho&s;e churches ordinarily and vi&s;ibly, with whom occa&s;ionally you may join without &s;in, &s;eemeth to be a mo&s;t unju&s;t &s;eparation."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Schi&s;m tried and condemned, p. 25, 27, 28. in Cro&s;by.</NOTE></P>
<P>Every candid reader will judge, whether the que&s;|tions now &s;ugge&s;ted, are not involved in the idea of occa&s;ional communion, upon the term of &s;in|cerity. Another intere&s;ting que&s;tion appears to be
<PB N="97" REF="026602_0097_0FD0B66F2611D1B0">connected, viz. Whether it be con&s;i&s;tent to com|municate with any per&s;on, or body of Chri&s;tians, with whom we could not unite in full fellow&s;hip, as members of the &s;ame church? If there be any act more &s;olemn, more expre&s;&s;ive of unity and a|greement, let it be pointed out! For per&s;ons to &s;eparate from each other, merely on account of di&s;agreement in &s;entiment, and yet hold occa&s;ion|al communion (which expre&s;&s;es their agreement) is the height of ab&s;urdity.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, if <Q>bapti&s;m was prior to coming to the Lord's table in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">po&s;tolic practice</Q> (which you have acknowledged, p. 13) &mdash;if it was then an immer&s;ion upon a profe&s;&s;ion of faith, which I tru&s;t has been made out in the preceding pages; and no &s;cripture evidence ap|pearing to the contrary; then you will not blame us for <HI>continuing in the apo&s;tolic doctrine,</HI> and for endeavouring carefully to imitate their <HI>practice.</HI> Hence it is probable our <HI>objections</HI> may continue, until proof &s;hall be made out from the word of God, that the apo&s;tolic church did admit per&s;ons to her communion merely upon the footing of <HI>&s;incerity,</HI> without any regard to the external mode of their obedience to Chri&s;t's other appointments.</P>

<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECTION VIII.</HI> Whether the Divine Conduct towards us be the Rule of Duty towards our Chri&s;tian Brethren, rather than God's revealed Will; briefly con&s;idered.</HEAD>
<P>IT will be readily granted, that &s;ome parts of the divine conduct are to be imitated by
<PB N="98" REF="026602_0098_0FD0B64CDC46E058">all who love God. Yet our obligation to <HI>be fol|lowers of God as dear children,</HI> does not originate &s;o much from what he <HI>does,</HI> as from what he <HI>commands.</HI> Therefore, we are not to imitate the divine conduct, in any thing which would lead us contrary to his revealed will.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome parts of the divine conduct, which it would be highly improper for us to at|tempt to imitate; &s;uch as the following: <HI>He</HI> &s;u&s;|pended the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of nature, "and held the falling day," until I&s;rael had gained the vic|tory over his enemies. <HI>He</HI> arre&s;ted <HI>Jordan</HI> in its cour&s;e, and compelled its waters to retire, and made a pa&s;&s;age for his cho&s;en tribes. <HI>He</HI> open|ed the mouth of <HI>Balaam</HI>'s a&s;s, and cau&s;ed the &s;tu|pid brute to reprove the more bruti&s;h prophet. <HI>He</HI> commanded <HI>Abraham;</HI> as a te&s;t of his love and obedience, to offer up his beloved &s;on for a &s;acrifice; and it is certain he highly approved of <HI>Abraham</HI>'s conduct, and ble&s;&s;ed his unre&s;erved obedience. I pre&s;ume no one will infer from this, that we are to expre&s;s our love to God by &s;acrificing our children to him. God has at &s;ev|eral times de&s;troyed his enemies by fire from heaven; but when the two di&s;ciples were de&s;irous of puni&s;hing the ungrateful Samaritans in the &s;ame way, Je&s;us reproved their blind zeal, and told them plainly, they knew not what &s;pirit they were of.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. xix. 24. 2 Kings, i. 10. Luke ix. 54.</NOTE></P>
<P>In&s;tances might be multiplied from &s;cripture, to &s;how, that the divine conduct is not in all ca&s;|es the rule of our duty; but you have &s;uppo&s;ed one, which you conclude is worthy of our imi|tation&mdash;
<PB N="99" REF="026602_0099_0FD0B670A3599368">It &s;hall now be the &s;ubject of our in|quiry.</P>
<P>You take it for granted, that God communes with the Paedo-bapti&s;ts at his holy table; and hence a&s;k, <Q>Why cannot you commune with tho&s;e at the table, with whom God communes?</Q> As this que&s;tion was anticipated in my other Piece, you have from thence introduced the fol|lowing reply, i. e. "It is not what God can or does do, but his revealed will, which is the rule of our duty." On this you ob&s;erve, <Q>I hope, Sir, I &s;hall never object to your making the re|vealed will of God the rule of your duty. But this, Sir, is a part of his revealed will, <HI>Be ye fol|lowers of God, as dear children.</HI> And if God be <HI>willing</HI> to commune with Paedo-bapti&s;ts, why &s;hould you be <HI>unwilling</HI> to imitate his example in this re&s;pect?</Q></P>
<P>You will permit me, Sir, to inquire, whether you &s;incerely think, that the Apo&s;tle had particu|lar reference to communion at the Lord's table, when he exhorted the Ephe&s;ians to be <HI>followers of God?</HI> If he had not, it affords no proof for your argument. If this were his object, he mu&s;t be under&s;tood as addre&s;&s;ing them in the follow|ing manner: Brethren, God communes with you, and why cannot you communicate with one another? <HI>Be ye followers of God, as dear children.</HI> But was the church of Ephe&s;us at this early period &s;o divided, that they did not hold vi&s;ible communion together? Were there then in the church Paedo-bapti&s;ts, and Anti-paedo|bapti&s;ts, who had &s;et up &s;eparate communions? When this is fairly proved, we ought to believe it.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="026602_0100_0FD0B6ACA6FFD360">
You go on to &s;ay&mdash; <Q>Suppo&s;ing that the Paedo-bapti&s;ts are really in an error; if Chri&s;t does not view the error as &s;o e&s;&s;ential, but that HE will commune with them, why &s;hould you?&mdash;Is the &s;ervant grester than his lord?</Q> By no means: <HI>for the &s;ervant knoweth n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t what his lord doeth.</HI> And although he giveth rules to his &s;er|vants to regulate their conduct by; yet he is not particularly bound by them him&s;elf. But you &s;eem to &s;uppo&s;e, that Chri&s;t commune, with you in a certian &s;en&s;e, in which we are unwilling to. But how are we to under&s;tand you? Sure|ly not that Chri&s;t comes per&s;onally among you, or that he actually communicates with you in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he bread and wine? If not, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e it is &s;piritually. That is, he may own and ble&s;s you, notwith&s;tanding there may be &s;ome imper|fections in your obedience. But are we unwil|ling to commune with you &s;piritually? Have not all good men, as far as they have the knowl|edge of each other, communion in this &s;en&s;e? And do they not heartily approve of all &s;incere Chri&s;tians, as far as they view them walking in the truth? We may not from hence infer, that Chri&s;t approves of the errors of any, or that the mo&s;t profu&s;e charity requires it of us.</P>
<P>To &s;uppo&s;e that the Paedo-bapti&s;ts are in an error, and that this is of &s;uch a nature that Chri&s;t could not commune with or ble&s;s them, would it not be to &s;uppo&s;e it fatal, and incon&s;i&s;t|ent with their eternal &s;alvation? And &s;hould it be granted, <Q>that God communes at his table with the pure in heart of both denominations,</Q> yet never in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e as to approve of the er|rors of either.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="026602_0101_0FD0B68F69165F20">
That God has communed with, or ble&s;&s;ed good men, notwith&s;tanding they were guilty of &s;ome errors, will appear from what follows:&mdash;It is &s;aid of <HI>Solomon,</HI> that he loved the Lord, and walked in the &s;tatutes of <HI>David</HI> his father; only he &s;acrificed and burnt incen&s;e in high places.&mdash;The &s;ame is &s;aid of <HI>Jehoa&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Jotham,</HI> that they <HI>did that which was right in the &s;ight of the Lord: But the high places were not taken away: the peo|ple &s;till &s;acrificed and burnt incen&s;e in the high places.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Kings, iii. 3. 2 King xii. 2, 3, and xv. 34, 35.</NOTE> We can here only conceive, that God approved of what was right according to his command|ments; while he wholly condemned their &s;acri|ficing in high places and groves.</P>
<P>When the ordinance of the pa&s;&s;over had not for a long time been ob&s;erved <HI>as it was written,</HI> king <HI>Hezekiah</HI> i&s;&s;ued his proclamation, &s;ummon|ing all I&s;rael to attend the &s;olemn fea&s;t. But when the people came together, many of them had not tho&s;e external qualifications which the ordinance required; and con&s;equently did <HI>eat the pa&s;&s;over otherwi&s;e than it was written: but Hezekiah prayed for them, &s;aying, the good Lord pardon every one that prepareth his heart to &s;eek God, the Lord God of his fathers, though he be not clean&s;ed according to the purification of the &s;anctu|ary.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Chron. xxx. 18, 19.</NOTE> Hence it is evident, that they were in &s;ome degree guilty, for omitting tho&s;e external pre-requi&s;ites which the ordinance required; notwith&s;tanding they prepared their <HI>hearts</HI> to &s;eek the Lord. If this were not the ca&s;e, they could not have needed a pardon, for this ever
<PB N="102" REF="026602_0102_0FD08037C2EB73A8">&s;uppo&s;es guilt. Thus while they experienced the divine approbation in preparing their <HI>hearts</HI> to &s;eek God, they needed his pardon for &s;ome <HI>external</HI> omi&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>You will recollect, Sir, that you have given it as your opinion. <Q>That the <HI>e&s;&s;ence</HI> of <HI>bapti&s;m</HI> does not con&s;i&s;t in any one particular mode whatever.</Q> Undoubtedly this may be &s;aid, with as much pro|priety, re&s;pecting communion; that the <HI>e&s;&s;ence</HI> of it does not con&s;i&s;t in any particular mode whatever; but in right affections of heart.</P>
<P>If this ob&s;ervation be ju&s;t, that the e&s;&s;ence of an ordinance does not con&s;i&s;t in the externals of it, but in &s;incerity of heart; and that Chri&s;tian communion does not require agreement in &s;en|timent, but only a union of 'affection and de&s;ires;' in this &s;en&s;e, I pre&s;ume, the Bapti&s;ts and Paedo-bapti&s;ts do cordially commune.</P>
<P>In remarking upon the motto of my other Piece, you have &s;aid, <Q>There mu&s;t be a union between God and man, or they cannot com|mune together&mdash;there mu&s;t be a cordial union. We mu&s;t love the &s;ame objects which God loves, and hate that which he hates.</Q> You &s;uppo&s;e, <Q>the &s;ame kind of agreement is e&s;&s;ential to our walking together?</Q> Now, Sir, if this cordial affection and union can fully exi&s;t, and we di&s;agree in one divine in&s;titution, why can it not, and we di&s;agree in another? Why is it thought more e&s;&s;ential to our Chri&s;tian fellow|&s;hip and union to be agreed in the ordinance of the &s;upper, than in the ordinance of bapti&s;m? Or are there any rea&s;ons for exalting the former &s;o much above the latter? If agreement in &s;en|timent
<PB N="103" REF="026602_0103_0FD0B69078065C88">be unnece&s;&s;ary to our Chri&s;tian fellow|&s;hip, then it can be of no con&s;equence for us to be agreed in the ordinance of the &s;upper. For according to this argument, two per&s;ons or churches may enjoy mutual communion to|gether, although one of them &s;hould partake of the bread and wine, and the other &s;it by at the &s;ame time and not partake.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I &s;ee nothing to forbid this conclu&s;ion, That we do commune with the Paedo-bapti&s;ts in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e which God does. We may not indeed in the &s;ame degree, as we have not the &s;ame degree of knowledge, with re|&s;pect to their conformity to his <HI>moral</HI> image, or po&s;itive requirements; but &s;o far as we &s;ee them bearing the image of <HI>truth,</HI> &s;o far we love and e&s;teem them.</P>
<P>But, Sir, do you conceive that God communes with you in a higher, or different &s;en&s;e, in the ordinance of the &s;upper, than what he does in the ordinance of bapti&s;m? If not, why may you not draw an argument equally forcible from that, to urge us to a compliance with your mode of bapti&s;m? I am willing to own, that I am enthu&s;ia&s;tic enough to believe, that God as <HI>re|ally</HI> manife&s;ts his all-approving pre&s;ence with us in the ordinance of <HI>bapti&s;m,</HI> as in that of the <HI>&s;up|per.</HI> But, &s;hould we from hence urge the pro|priety of your adopting our mode of bapti&s;m, without producing any other proof in &s;upport of it, would you think the argument conclu&s;ive? Mo&s;t certainly you would not.</P>
<P>You have taken it for granted, that God com|munes with the Paedo-bapti&s;ts, and that his ex|ample
<PB N="104" REF="026602_0104_0FD080398543D6E0">is worthy of imitation. But have we not as much rea&s;on to believe, that the bapti&s;m of Chri&s;t by an immer&s;ion in Jordan, was de&s;igned as an example for believers through every age, as that his communing with your denomination is de|&s;igned as an example for us to imitate?

But, Sir, if in&s;titutions <HI>are divine,</HI> it is not in the power of <HI>circum&s;tances,</HI> however combined, or any thing el&s;e &s;hort of the power which made them, to alter either their

The moment we alter an in&s;titution, we de&s;troy its authority. It can no longer claim the high privilege of a <HI>divine</HI> origin; but mu&s;t be looked upon as the ba&s;e-born offspring of hu|man <HI>invention.</HI></P>
<P>That there can be circum&s;tances in our pre|&s;ent &s;ituation which may render it nece&s;&s;ary, or even ju&s;tifiable, to depart from the <HI>apo&s;tolic prac|tice,</HI> I cannot conceive. Yet here we are not &s;o happy as to be agreed in opinion; for you &s;ay&mdash; <Q>I am not certain that there can be no circum|&s;tances in which it might be lawful to admit to the Lord's &s;upper prior to bapti&s;m.</Q> E&s;pecially if the mode of bapti&s;m be immer&s;ion. <Q>For a real Chri&s;tian may for many years be &s;ubjected to &s;uch bodily di&s;orders, that it would be pre|&s;umption rather than duty, to be plunged all under water; and yet at certain times he might be able to attend the ordinance of the Lord's &s;upper.

<P>It appears to me, Sir, that you draw conclu|&s;ions without premi&s;es. For you &s;uppo&s;e we de|bar a per&s;on from a <HI>privilege</HI> in one in&s;tance, be|cau&s;e he is unable to do his <HI>duty</HI> in another. I &s;uppo&s;e you are mi&s;taken in both. For fir&s;t, I do not believe that God requires any duty of his creatures, which his holy providence has ren|dered them unable to perform: which is the &s;uppo&s;ed ca&s;e with regard to bapti&s;m. Nor &s;ec|ondly,
<PB N="107" REF="026602_0107_0FD0B692DF479950">do I believe that it is the duty or privilege of any per&s;on to attend one &s;acred ordinance, while God in his providence prevents his attend|ing another, which has a <HI>prior</HI> claim on his obe|dience; and while the <HI>latter,</HI> by <Q>apo&s;tolic prac|tice,</Q> is a nece&s;&s;ary qualification for the <HI>former.</HI> This idea you have fully illu&s;trated in your next page, where you ob&s;erve; that <Q>Many things which are ordinarily incumbent duties, are not &s;o in all circum&s;tances.</Q> This ob&s;ervation appears perfectly ju&s;t, and the very circum&s;tance you have mentioned of the per&s;on's being unbaptized, ren|ders it incon&s;i&s;tent with duty for him to partake of the Lord's &s;upper.</P>
<P>For I can as ea&s;ily conceive of its being a per|&s;on's duty or privilege to go to meeting, while by the providence of God he is confined at home; as to believe that it is his duty to go to the com|munion-table, while by the &s;ame providence he is unable to attend the previous qualifications which the in&s;titution requires.</P>
<P>Allowing immer&s;ion to be e&s;&s;ential to go&s;pel bapti&s;m, and a per&s;on to become a real Chri&s;tian when but nine years old, and the &s;tate of his health &s;uch as would render it un&s;uitable for him to be baptized, &s;hould he live to be nine hundred and &s;ixty-nine, I &s;hould never &s;uppo&s;e it to be his du|ty to communicate while in that &s;ituation; nor can I &s;uppo&s;e any well enlightened Chri&s;tian would ever de&s;ire it.</P>
<P>But, &s;hould it even be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the or|der of the in&s;titutions might be di&s;pen&s;ed with in particular ca&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, &s;o far as to admit to communion pious per&s;ons, who&s;e bodily infirmities would not
<PB N="108" REF="026602_0108_0FD0B673AB240588">allow of their being baptized&mdash;What then? Shall we from hence argue to a general practice, and admit unbaptized per&s;ons to communion who have no &s;uch infirmities to plead? If this be not the ca&s;e, your argument lo&s;es the whole of its force; unle&s;s your communicants are all <HI>in|valids!</HI></P>
<P>The inconclu&s;ivene&s;s of this argument will more fully appear, by attending to the ob&s;erva|tions you have brought to illu&s;trate it by. The fir&s;t is, the in&s;tance of <HI>David</HI>'s taking the <HI>&s;hew bread.</HI> You ob&s;erve, <Q>He was hungry, and had need of it for the &s;u&s;tenance and pre&s;ervation of life;</Q> but will you from hence conclude, that it was lawful for <HI>David,</HI> or any other per&s;on in ordinary ca&s;es, to have taken the <HI>hallowed bread,</HI> when there was no &s;uch nece&s;&s;ity? If this be not the ca&s;e, it will not help your cau&s;e; for the matter in di&s;pute is not a ca&s;e of <HI>nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> but of &s;uppo&s;|ed conveniency; and which, in order to its being practi&s;ed, mu&s;t be lawful in ordinary ca&s;es. Your other ob&s;ervation re&s;pecting a per&s;on's being nec|e&s;&s;arily detained from the hou&s;e of God, is much of the &s;ame tenor: for granting that a per&s;on's infirmities may excu&s;e him from the duty of at|tending public wor&s;hip, &s;hall we hence infer that this is any excu&s;e for others, or even for the &s;ame per&s;on when well? Surely we &s;hall not.</P>
<P>You &s;uppo&s;e when <HI>David</HI> violated a <HI>po&s;itive precept,</HI> he did it to pre&s;erve his life, and that in this &s;en&s;e he conducted him&s;elf agreeably to the <HI>moral law.</HI> Now, Sir, when it can be made to ap|pear, that a per&s;on's life, or eternal &s;alvation, de|pend on communicating at the Lord's table, I
<PB N="109" REF="026602_0109_0FD0B6958FE609B0">cannot &s;ay but in &s;uch a ca&s;e, it may be lawful to go contrary to po&s;itive in&s;titutions; to depart from <HI>apo&s;tolic practice;</HI> and plunge our&s;elves into almo&s;t every incon&s;i&s;tency, <HI>rather than a weak brother &s;hould peri&s;h for whom Chri&s;t died.</HI></P>
<P>Your ob&s;ervations in favour of giving the com|munion to the &s;ick who are not in&s;titutionally qualified to receive it, lead us to compare it with the ancient cu&s;tom of baptizing the <HI>clinics.</HI></P>
<P>A learned hi&s;torian ob&s;erves, "At fir&s;t all times were alike, and per&s;ons were baptized as op|portunity and occa&s;ion &s;erved, but it was after re&s;trained to two &s;olemn and &s;tated times of the year, viz. <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Whit&s;untide.</HI>" The&s;e in|cluded the fifty days between: "Yet if there was a <HI>nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> (as in ca&s;e of <HI>&s;ickne&s;s</HI> and danger of <HI>death</HI>) they might be baptized at any other time."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Cave's Primitive Chri&s;tianity. p. 104.</NOTE> And notwith&s;tanding they allowed im|mer&s;ion to be the proper mode, yet, in ca&s;e of danger of death, they would &s;prinkle per&s;ons as they lay in their beds. It is evident they over|rated the in&s;titution; and your notion of giving the communion to the &s;ick who are unable to be baptized, has a little of the &s;ame appearance.</P>
<P>I do not find that the&s;e ancient Chri&s;tians plead apo&s;tolic authority for this practice, nor did they allow of this mode of bapti&s;m in ordinary ca&s;es.</P>
<P>But why &s;hould it be thought nece&s;&s;ary for a real Chri&s;tian to receive the communion, &s;o long as his bodily infirmities forbid his being regularly baptized? It cannot be thought nece&s;&s;ary to his eternal &s;alvation; for if a Chri&s;tian, that is alrea|dy &s;ecured: nor that the go&s;pel rule requires it;
<PB N="110" REF="026602_0110_0FD0B67657486360">for that enjoins, that <HI>all things be done decently and in order:</HI> nor yet the glory of God, for that nev|er requires &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to any <HI>po&s;itive law,</HI> but of tho&s;e who are capable of the po&s;itive pre-requi&s;ites to obey it. Hence I conclude, that every unbap|tized Chri&s;tian, who&s;e infirmities may be &s;uch, as to render it un&s;uitable for him to be baptized and join the vi&s;ible church, ought &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively to wait, until God in his providence opens a door for him in a regular manner to approach his holy ta|ble; and not to act fooli&s;hly like <HI>Saul,</HI> who grew impatient in waiting for <HI>Samuel,</HI> and <HI>forced him|&s;elf and offered a burnt-offering.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. xiii. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE></P>
<P>I have endeavoured thus far to trace your ar|gument, and have not yet found &s;ufficient rea&s;on to depart from the <HI>apo&s;tolic practice,</HI> but as we are &s;o happy as to be agreed in this point, that bapti&s;m according to their practice was <HI>prior</HI> to coming to the Lord's table, on this ground we will bring the matter to trial. Now, Sir, I would wi&s;h to a&s;k, How we can con&s;i&s;tently communi|cate with you. If we communicate with you as <HI>baptized</HI> per&s;ons, we practically give up our prin|ciples; if we communicate with you as <HI>unbap|tized,</HI> then we unwarrantably depart from the apo&s;tolic practice. You cannot be in&s;en&s;ible, my dear Sir, that this is the very <HI>pith</HI> of the contro|ver&s;y; and that one or the other of the above difficulties will inevitably fall to our &s;hare, in ca&s;e we e&s;tabli&s;h communion with you.</P>
<P>It is a fact generally known, and which we do not wi&s;h to conceal, that we cannot acknowledge <HI>Infant-&s;prinkling</HI> to be <HI>go&s;pel</HI> bapti&s;m. Could this
<PB N="111" REF="026602_0111_0FD0B6959642A390">be allowed, the di&s;pute would be at an end; and our &s;entiments at an end with it. For if the in|&s;titution requires no more than <HI>&s;prinkling,</HI> then <HI>plunging</HI> mu&s;t be forever unnece&s;&s;ary; and be|&s;ides, we &s;hall be ju&s;tly chargeable with re-bap|tizing, a practice we condemn as much as you do. But you &s;eem to be willing that we &s;hould be Bapti&s;ts, and yet blame us for not communica|ting with other denominations. But, why do you not <HI>lay the axe to the root of the tree,</HI> and blame us for being Bapti&s;ts, and not blame us for being con&s;i&s;tent?</P>
<P>I doubt not but every unprejudiced mind will readily perceive, that the matter comes to this point with us, that in order to communicate with you we mu&s;t either give up what you and we agree was the apo&s;tolic practice, or our &s;enti|ments as Bapti&s;ts. One or the other of the&s;e will be a rational inference from our conduct.</P>
<P>From what has now been ob&s;erved, it will be ea&s;y to perceive the different &s;ituations we &s;tand in to each other. When per&s;ons join your churches, who have been baptized by us, I have never heard of your baptizing them again. On the other hand, we always baptize tho&s;e who come from your churches to us, unle&s;s they have been immer&s;ed upon a profe&s;&s;ion of faith. But is this difference of conduct to be attributed to catholici&s;m in you, or the want of it in us? By no means. The truth is this, <HI>immer&s;ion</HI> includes <HI>&s;prinkling;</HI> but &s;prinkling does not include im|mer&s;ion: therefore the per&s;on who is immer&s;ed, is in your view lawfully baptized; whil&s;t he who is only &s;prinkled is not &s;o in ours. It hence
<PB N="112" REF="026602_0112_0FD0B6765E3A1D08">follow, that, con&s;i&s;tently with your &s;entiments and view of the <HI>'apo&s;tolic practice,'</HI> you may in|vite us to communicate in your churches; while we, having the &s;ame views, cannot invite you.</P>
<P>It is hoped that the preceding ob&s;ervations will fully &s;atisfy our Paedo-bapti&s;t brethren, that our rea&s;ons for not communicating with them, do not ari&s;e from the want of brotherly affec|tion towards them; but from a con&s;cientious regard to what we under&s;tand to be <HI>the order of the go&s;pel.</HI></P>
<P>So long as we allow the go&s;pel to contain a complete &s;y&s;tem of faith and practice, we mu&s;t endeavour to follow the rules there given, rather than imitate other &s;uppo&s;ed parts of the divine conduct.</P>
<P>But &s;hould we even carry the matter as high as you have &s;uppo&s;ed; that Chri&s;t &s;hould per|&s;onally come to one of your communions, and actually partake with you; and &s;hould addre&s;s you as his friends, and bid you eat and drink: I am not certain that his conduct in &s;o doing would call for our imitation, &s;o long as the e&s;tab|li&s;hed laws of his kingdom remain as they now are.</P>
<P>When Chri&s;t fir&s;t commi&s;&s;ioned his di&s;ciples, and &s;ent them forth to preach the go&s;pel, heal the &s;ick, &amp;c.&mdash;<HI>he commanded them &s;aying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. x. 5.</NOTE> Neverthele&s;s, he him|&s;elf went into the borders of <HI>Tyre</HI> and <HI>Sidon,</HI> and there healed the daughter of the <HI>Syrophenician</HI> woman, who was a Gentile.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mark vii. 24&mdash;30.</NOTE> He al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed

If this be not the ca&s;e, we are likely to ramble in eternal uncertain|ty! But, ble&s;&s;ed be God, <HI>we have a more &s;ure word of prophecy, to which we do well to take heed.</HI></P>
<P>It may be proper here to take notice of the con&s;equences you have drawn, from the &s;uppo|&s;ition of our proving, that a conformity to our <HI>mode</HI> of bapti&s;m is an e&s;&s;ential term of commu|nion. You &s;ay, <Q>Should this be made to ap|pear, it will then al&s;o appear, that all the Pae|do-bapti&s;ts, who have thought, they enjoyed communion with God at his table, have been <HI>mo&s;t mi&s;erably deluded.</HI></Q> If &s;o, the con&s;equence is dreadful indeed!

You al&s;o conclude, that if bapti&s;m in our mode be an e&s;&s;ential qual|ification; <Q>then the Paedo-bapti&s;ts are e&s;&s;en|tially wrong and <HI>wicked</HI> in coming to the table;</Q> and their conduct an <HI>abomination</HI> in the &s;ight of God.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page. 28.</NOTE> My dear Sir, are you &s;o intoxicated

<P>In your next page you go on to &s;ay, <Q>Grant|ing that immer&s;ion be the <HI>appointed</HI> mode of bapti&s;m, and believers the <HI>only</HI> proper &s;ubjects, yet if a Paedo-bapti&s;t <HI>really think</HI> otherwi&s;e, and with an obedient heart offer up his children in our mode, his conduct is not chargeable with any <HI>moral evil.</HI> All the evil which is to be im|puted to his conduct, is of the <HI>natural</HI> kind.&mdash; And the per&s;on in &s;o doing, is as well accepted in the &s;ight of God, as if his external conduct had been according to the appointed mode of bapti&s;m.</Q> It is peculiar indeed, that with re|gard to the in&s;titution of <HI>bapti&s;m,</HI> you &s;hould conclude, that if you hone&s;tly mi&s;take both the <HI>&s;ubjects</HI> and <HI>mode,</HI> and practi&s;e in a way entirely different, it by no means hinders the divine ap|probation and acceptance. But with regard to the ordinance of the <HI>&s;upper,</HI> if it &s;hould be prov|ed that you had <HI>as</HI> hone&s;tly made a mi&s;take with regard to a previous duty, and have thought that

<P>According to the above argument, all that is nece&s;&s;ary to render bapti&s;m acceptable, is only to <HI>'really think'</HI> you are right: hence by a parity of rea&s;oning, if you are not accepted of God in the ordmance of the &s;upper, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e you do not 'really think' you are right when you come to the table. But are you not as &s;incere in com|ing to the Lord's table, as in offering up your chil|dren? If you are not, I &s;hall join with you, that your conduct is an abomination to the Lord. But, allowing you to be &s;incere, and to really think you are right, and we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that you have as much rea&s;on to think you have been <Q>mi&s;erably deluded</Q> in the <HI>former,</HI> as in the <HI>latter.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, Sir, I have endeavoured carefully to at|tend to the argumentative part of your <HI>Friendly Letter,</HI> and have attempted to an&s;wer tho&s;e ar|guments on which I &s;uppo&s;ed you laid the great|e&s;t &s;tre&s;s; either in a direct way, or by &s;howing the invalidity of the evidence by which they were &s;upported. And however an impartial public may judge, I have the &s;atisfaction to think, that in the preceding &s;heets the following particulars have been fairly e&s;tabli&s;hed, by evidence from &s;cripture, rea&s;on, and the concurring te&s;timony of many eminent Paedo-bapti&s;t writers.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That vi&s;ible, or profe&s;&s;ing believers, are the <HI>only proper &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m,</HI> known and de&s;cribed in the word of God.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That an entire immer&s;ion in water, is nece&s;&s;ary to the due admini&s;tration of the ordinance.</ITEM>

Hence it follows, by <Q>nece&s;|&s;ary con&s;equence,</Q> that a conformity to <HI>our mode</HI> of bapti&s;m (if that has been proved to be the go&s;|pel mode) is to the con&s;idered as a nece&s;&s;ary pre|requi&s;ite or (if it &s;uits you better) <HI>term</HI> of commu|nion at the Lord's table, &s;o long as we think it important to follow the <HI>'apo&s;tolic practice.'</HI> We do not mean by this to dictate to our brethren of other denominations with regard to their terms of communion; but only &s;how the general prin|ciples on which we proceed among our&s;elves.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION IX.</HI> Ob&s;ervations on the Plan of Communion propo&s;ed in the 'Friendly Letter,' with Remarks on &s;everal other Things connected with the Subject.</HEAD>
<P>SIR, your profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign in writing, has too much of the appearance of friend&s;hip, to be pa&s;&s;ed over unnoticed. But whether if your plan were adopted, it would produce the de&s;ired effect, is a matter of &s;erious inquiry.</P>
<P><Q>To promote the peace and pro&s;perity of Zion, by opening a door for free communion between the Bapti&s;ts and Paedo-bapti&s;ts,</Q> is your profe&s;|&s;ed object. And notwith&s;tanding I have appear|ed upon the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion, I per&s;uade my&s;elf, that no per&s;on would be happier in &s;ee|ing our objections fairly removed, and a con&s;i&s;t|ent way pointed out for a mutual interchange of
<PB N="117" REF="026602_0117_0FD0B6989B4ED458">communions. But if it mu&s;t be done at the ex|pen&s;e of our <HI>&s;entiments</HI> as Bapti&s;ts, you will not think us unrea&s;onable in requiring ample proof that we are wrong, before we do it.</P>
<P>The particular boundaries of your plan are ex|pre&s;&s;ed in the following words. <Q>It is not my de|&s;ign, nor my de&s;ire, to have a door opened for free communion among all who <HI>pro&s;e&s;s</HI> religion on either &s;ide; but only with regard to tho&s;e who&s;e vi&s;ible conduct is evidential of real piety.</Q> It is a little difficult here to under&s;tand your mean|ing. If you mean to e&s;tabli&s;h communion with &s;ome churches which you may con&s;ider as ortho|dox in doctrine, and regular indi&s;cipline, while you reject others, your plan may be practicable. But as the terms or qualifications you propo&s;e, may be the lot of individuals rather than churches, it appears to be attended with &s;ome difficulty. For it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that in every Chri&s;tian, community there may be &s;ome &s;ound, <Q>who&s;e vi&s;|ible conduct is evidential of real piety.</Q> With tho&s;e it &s;eems you would wi&s;h to communciate, while with the church as a body you could by no means hold fellow&s;hip.</P>
<P>In order to reduce the idea to practice, we will &s;uppo&s;e ten members of a Bapti&s;t church in your vicinity, attend at one of your communion &s;ea|&s;ons, with a de&s;ire to enjoy privileges with you; but when the church is called upon to act upon their reque&s;t, they inform tho&s;e brethren that with five of them they are fully &s;atisfied, and bid them a cordial welcome to a &s;eat in their communion; but to the others they ob&s;erve, they have not obtained the evidence of their <Q>real pie|ty;</Q>
<PB N="118" REF="026602_0118_0FD0B67A859DF530">and therefore mu&s;t con&s;cientiou&s;ly refu&s;e to partake with them. It is natural to &s;uppo&s;e that the feelings of the&s;e brethren would be wounded upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion; &s;ome on their own account, and &s;ome on account of others. And the church to which they belong might con|&s;ider them&s;elves injured; and it is likely the effect would be contention, rather than peace. Diffi|culties &s;imilar to the above are fairly &s;uppo&s;eable.</P>
<P>If you plea&s;e, Sir, we will now &s;uppo&s;e a dif|ferent ca&s;e. It &s;o happens, that &s;everal of your brethren remove into the neighbourhood of a Bapti&s;t church, and from their &s;ituation are de|&s;irous of enjoying privileges with them. The Bapti&s;ts, enlightened by your &s;entiments, are equally de&s;irous of indulging them; and although the&s;e brethren have not received bapti&s;m in the way which the church under&s;tand the in&s;titution, yet as they appear to be <HI>&s;incere,</HI> which <Q>is the very, SOUL and ESSENCE of conformity to Chri&s;t,</Q> the church cordially grant their reque&s;t. For a &s;ea&s;on they enjoy privileges together, and no particular difficulty ari&s;es; but at length one of tho&s;e communicants becomes diffatisfied with re&s;pect to his Infant-bapti&s;m; and in the exer|ci&s;e of godly <HI>&s;incerity</HI> is led to believe, that it is his indi&s;pen&s;able duty to be immer&s;ed. But while waiting a convenient opportunity for that purpo&s;e, a communion &s;ea&s;on intervenes; it now becomes a &s;erious que&s;tion, both with him and the church, whether it be duty for him to com|municate in his pre&s;ent &s;ituation? As the church adopted this new mode of communion in con|formity to your &s;y&s;tem; they think proper to re|cur
<PB N="119" REF="026602_0119_0FD0B699E6253A70">to it, in order to decide the pre&s;ent doubtful ca&s;e. They fir&s;t con&s;ult the terms on which you propo&s;e free communion; the&s;e they find to be <HI>'real piety'</HI> or <HI>'godly &s;incerity.'</HI> That the man was a &s;ubject of the&s;e qualifications when they fir&s;t admitted him, they have no doubt; and they are equally &s;atisfied of his <HI>&s;incerity</HI> and <HI>piety</HI> with his pre&s;ent views; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> fir&s;t are inclined to think it may be his duty to communicate. But there is one difficulty &s;till which &s;eems to embar|ra&s;s their proceeding; that is, if they under&s;tand you right, (p. 9) it is not a que&s;tion with you, <Q>Whether bapti&s;m in <HI>&s;ome</HI> mode be an <HI>e&s;&s;ential qualification.</HI></Q> And although the per&s;on once <HI>&s;in|cerely</HI> believed him&s;elf to be baptized, he now <HI>as</HI> &s;incerely believes he is not; and <Q>as a man <HI>think|eth in his heart &s;o is he.</HI></Q> For the &s;cripture being '<HI>&s;ilent</HI> re&s;pecting his Infant-bapti&s;m,' the only thing which gave it validity, either with him&s;elf or the church, was his &s;incerity; but <HI>that</HI> failing in this particular, <HI>this</HI> mu&s;t con&s;equently fail with it; and he can no longer be con&s;idered as baptized, than while he &s;incerely believes him&s;elf to be &s;o. He is now, in his own view, and in the view of the church, unbaptized. And I cannot &s;ee but that he mu&s;t appear in the &s;ame light to you, upon your own &s;cale of rea&s;oning. But, however, he is unque&s;tionably po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of <HI>real piety</HI> and <HI>godly &s;incerity,</HI> which are your di&s;tingui&s;hing terms of communion; and yet, as he is in his own opinion unbaptized, he lacks an <HI>'e&s;&s;ential qualification.'</HI> It follows, that by your &s;y&s;tem he is both quali|fied, and unqualified, at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the Bapti&s;t church would not appear
<PB N="120" REF="026602_0120_0FD0B67C14E64BC8">in the mo&s;t con&s;ident light, to baptize a per&s;on with whom they had probably communed &s;everal years; and yet the man cannot act con&s;i&s;tently with godly &s;incerity without it.

<P>In connexion with your de&s;ign, you have an|other ob&s;ervation, upon which I &s;hall make one or two remarks.

</LIST></P>
<P>It may be proper in the next place to attend to the manner in which you an&s;wer a <HI>ca&s;e</HI> propo&s;ed in my other Piece. The ca&s;e was plain, and I humbly conceive quite to the point in hand. The &s;ub&s;tance of the que&s;tion was this; Had <HI>Enoch, Noah,</HI> or <HI>Melchizedeck,</HI> been contemporary with <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> would he have permitted them to com|munion in the pa&s;chal &s;upper while uncircum|ci&s;ed? Or had <HI>Noah</HI> been pre&s;ent when the tab|ernacle was erected, and had been di&s;po&s;ed to have given the people a &s;ermon, upon the incarnation of the Son of God, and the righteou&s;ne&s;s of faith, of which that &s;acred &s;tructure was typical would not <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and the people have cheerfully heard

<P>To this you an&s;wer, <Q>We &s;hall not di&s;pute but that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> would have admitted tho&s;e amba&s;&s;a|dors to preach; being convinced of their divine commi&s;&s;ion. Nor would he have forbidden their partaking of the pa&s;chal fea&s;t, had they been circumci&s;ed, whether it were done in in|fancy or adult age, before or after believing, with a knife, a razor, a &s;cythe, a &s;ickle, or even a &s;harp &s;tone.</Q></P>
<P>Sir, did you think this would be con&s;idered as an an&s;wer? It certainly will not. In&s;tead of look|ing the argument fairly in the face, you have en|deavoured quite to evade it.</P>
<P>You agree that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> would have admitted tho&s;e amba&s;&s;adors to preach. The que&s;tion then was, whether he would have received them to the pa&s;chal fea&s;t, while uncircumci&s;ed? In&s;tead of a direct an&s;wer, you reply, <Q>Nor would he have forbidden their partaking of the pa&s;chal fea&s;t had they <HI>been</HI> circumci&s;ed.</Q> True, Sir; nor will your victory co&s;t you any thing; for this point was never di&s;puted. You proceed to remark &s;everal circum&s;tances re&s;pecting circumci&s;ion; but take particular care not to mention any which would affect the validity of the <HI>rite.</HI> Nor are the ca&s;es parallel between the circum&s;tances mentioned, and that of Infant-bapti&s;m. This will &s;ufficiently appear by what follows: as
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <Q>Whether it were done in infancy or adult age,</Q> no matter which; for infants of <HI>eight days old</HI> were expre&s;sly men|tioned in the in&s;titution, and they were command|ed on that day to circumci&s;e them; and repeated

<ITEM>2. Whether 'before or after believing;' this was entirely immaterial. For the command was, <HI>And he that is eight days old &s;hall be circumci&s;ed among you, every man-child in your generations, he that is born in the hou&s;e or bought with money of any &s;tranger, which is not of thy &s;eed&mdash;mu&s;t needs be circumci&s;ed.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. xvii. 12, 13.</NOTE> It hence follows, that <HI>believing</HI> was not required in the &s;ubjects for circumci&s;ion, nor yet that the <HI>par|ents</HI> &s;hould be believers; for the child of an idol|atrous heathen, bought for a &s;lave, had as fair a claim to that in&s;titution, as any of the believing &s;ons of <HI>Abraham.</HI> This cannot be &s;aid of the go&s;pel in&s;titution; for when one &s;aid, See here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized? The reply was, <HI>If thou believe&s;t with all thine heart, thou maye&s;t.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts viii. 36, 27.</NOTE> And although &s;ome believing par|ents claim the privilege of bapti&s;m for their chil|dren, I do not remember to have heard that any ever did for their <HI>&s;ervants.</HI> Nor does the benev|olent doctrine of Infant-bapti&s;m make any provi|&s;ion for the ill-fated infant, who&s;e parents are both unbelievers.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Whether circumci&s;ion were per|formed <Q>with a knife, a razor, a &s;cythe, a &s;ickle, or even a &s;harp &s;tone,</Q> we acknowledge it equally valid, providing the rite was performed. So like|wi&s;e &s;hould we look upon bapti&s;m to be valid, if performed in <HI>Jordan,</HI> in the <HI>Tiber,</HI> in a <HI>pond,</HI> in a <HI>po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">,</HI> in a <HI>ci&s;tern,</HI> in a <HI>font,</HI> or in any other place, where water could conveniently be had &s;ufficient to immer&s;e in.</ITEM>

<P><PB N="124" REF="026602_0124_0FD0B67EE3388290">
But if you plea&s;e, Sir, we will vary th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> circum|&s;tances a little.

<P>We will now take notice of what you ob&s;erve (p. 31.) You &s;ay, <Q>It has been difficult for us to &s;ee the con&s;i&s;tency of your conduct, in refu&s;|ing to commune at the Lord's table with our denomination; while at the &s;ame time, you prac|tically acknowledge our Mini&s;ters to be autho|rized and qualified to preach the go&s;pel.</Q> That we are perfectly free from incon&s;i&s;tency will not be pretended; nor do we think that a compliance with your mode of communion, would free us from the charge. Perhaps with our pre&s;ent dif|ferent views, we cannot act more con&s;i&s;tently than to follow the advice given by the Apo&s;tle; "Whereto we have already <HI>attained,</HI> let us walk by the &s;ame rule, let us mind the &s;ame thing."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil. iii. 16.</NOTE> We have <HI>attained</HI> to an agreement in praying to the &s;ame God and Father of all; and al&s;o in preaching the go&s;pel of his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t. But we have not attained to an agreement with re&s;pect to the &s;ubjects and mode of bapti&s;m; nor in the vi&s;ible qualifications of communicants for the Lord's table. How can two walk together ex|cept
<PB N="125" REF="026602_0125_0FD0B69ED507D1D0">they be agreed?

<P>Although we do not think of clearing our&s;elves of incon&s;i&s;tency, by charging your conduct with the &s;ame; yet it may not be improper here to inquire, whether your conduct towards us in &s;ome in&s;tances, be quite con&s;i&s;tent with your profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip in e&s;tabli&s;hing <HI>free</HI> communion with with us?

I conclude, Sir, you are &s;en&s;ible that this privilege has been generally de|nied, and this rea&s;on has been often a&s;&s;igned for the denial: That to di&s;mi&s;s a member to a Bap|ti&s;t church, would be to acknowledge it a church of Chri&s;t.

<P>Permit me, Sir, to mention one thing more. Why are your pulpits &s;o frequently denied to the Mini&s;ters of our denomination? Is it becau&s;e they are heterodox in doctrine, or vicious in their conduct? They are not charged with either. Is it becau&s;e they may want literary accompli&s;h|ments? This might be imagined, were it not that tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s them are often denied as well as others. Is it becau&s;e we do not communicate
<PB N="126" REF="026602_0126_0FD0B68064708D60">with you at the table? If you complain of our being uncharitable in this, remember you are not to render evil for evil; but contrariwi&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Perhaps &s;ome who have thus been denied, by their '&s;incere' but differing brethren, have been indulged with the &s;pacious temple of their royal Ma&s;ter, and with much the &s;ame accommodations which he had.

<P>SIR, I cannot do ju&s;tice to my&s;elf and the denomination to which I belong, without tak|ing notice of &s;everal charges which you have brought again&s;t us. In the fir&s;t place, you have charged me with 'quoting &s;cripture' in a method 'calculated to mi&s;lead the ignorant and inatten|tive;' of 'arrogancy and uncharitablene&s;s;' and of <Q>having done great injury to the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul.</HI></Q> (Page 17, 35, 38.)</P>
<P>The fir&s;t in&s;tance of which you complain, is in the following words, "Sincerity is not the term
<PB N="127" REF="026602_0127_0FD0B6A011344C00">of communion; but being conformed to the A|po&s;tles' doctrine, and continuing &s;tedfa&s;tly there|in. Acts ii. 42." Upon which you thus ob&s;erve; <Q>From the manner of your citing, or rather al|luding, to this text, it would be natural to ex|pect that upon examination we &s;hould find the in&s;pired writer de&s;cribing the terms of commu|nion.</Q> I conclude, Sir, upon examination this does abundantly appear. Nor am I convinced, that the pa&s;&s;age is not pertinent to the purpo&s;e for which it was cited; and if it does not de&s;cribe the terms of communion, I know not of any one which does. <Q>But (you &s;ay) in&s;tead of this, we find him &s;imply relating the conduct of &s;ome young converts, who had been already admitted to communion.</Q> But, Sir, are you not mi&s;ta|ken? He is here de&s;cribing the very manner in which the&s;e converts were admitted; and which fully &s;hows the 'apo&s;tolic practice.'</P>
<P>But what is the account given of their proceed|ings? You an&s;wer, <Q>Let us read the 41&s;t and 42d ver&s;es in connexion.</Q> <HI>Then they who gladly received the word were baptized; and the &s;ame day there were added unto them about three thou&s;and &s;ouls. And they continued &s;tedfa&s;tly in the Apo&s;tles' doctrine and fellow&s;hip, and in breaking of bread, and in pray|ers.</HI> And were they not baptized until they receiv|ed the word? No, they were not; and were <HI>they</HI> baptized and no others? The &s;cripture is totally '<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lent' as to any others.

<PB N="128" REF="026602_0128_0FD0B681E59CF3B8">would beg to know, where you find any account of their having been admitted before this?</P>
<P>You farther ob&s;erve, <Q>That any per&s;on of good di&s;cernment may &s;ee, that in this text there is no appearance of de&s;ign to a&s;certain the terms of communion.</Q> Let the de&s;ign be what it may, here is evidently a&s;certained the apo&s;tolic prac|tice; and the exact manner, &s;tep by &s;tep, in which they proceeded to communion.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture which you introduce, as being &s;o very appo&s;ite to your mode of commu|nion, and on which you lay much &s;tre&s;s, is this; <HI>'Be ye followers of God as dear children.'</HI> The 'di&s;cerning reader' will now judge, whether in this pa&s;&s;age there is any greater <Q>appearance of de&s;ign, to a&s;certain the terms of communion,</Q> than in the one which I alluded to.

<P>In my other Piece, in an&s;wering &s;everal pleas in favour of free communion, I ob&s;erved that it had been urged, "That the &s;cripture account of bap|ti&s;m, was left in &s;o much darkne&s;s and ambiguity, both as to the &s;ubjects and mode, that nothing certain could be determined." In remarking up|on which I made the following ob&s;ervation; "It may be remembered that when the talents were committed to the &s;ervants to occupy, the two who improved made no complaints; the other had a hard ma&s;ter, an au&s;tere man, and a great many
<PB N="129" REF="026602_0129_0FD0B6A164273020">difficulties &s;tood in the way of duty." After mak|ing your &s;arca&s;tical paraphra&s;e upon my ob&s;erva|tion, you bring forward your charge of <Q>arrogancy and uncharitablene&s;s;</Q> to which it may be re|plied&mdash;The ob&s;ervation was de&s;igned entirely for tho&s;e who make the above plea; and no one will feel him&s;elf injured by the application, if he be not the character de&s;cribed.

<P>To plead the want of &s;ufficient light in the &s;crip|tures, as the rea&s;on of our wrong &s;entiments, is indeed to impeach Chri&s;t.

<P>This, Sir, is not true. For our &s;entiments carry the fulle&s;t demon&s;tration to the contrary.

We do not baptize per&s;ons to m&agrave;ke them Chri&s;tians, but be|cau&s;e we look upon them to be &s;uch already. And it is well known, that a per&s;on cannot be accepted with us, on account of <HI>lineal</HI> de&s;cent

It will probably be granted, that the time has been, when it required &s;ome degree of <HI>&s;elfdenial</HI> to be a Bapti&s;t: When the <HI>pen</HI> of the hi&s;torian, and the <HI>tongue</HI> of the orator, were invidiou&s;ly em|ployed, in repre&s;enting us in the mo&s;t ridiculous, and whim&s;ical light.

When it was remarked that a prie&s;t was not always at hand, new canons empowered him to depute others to perform the ceremony, and midwives were licen&s;ed.

<P>The <HI>form</HI> of &s;ervice now in u&s;e among our brethren of the Epi&s;copal church, leads us to &s;up|po&s;e, that they a&s;cribe quite as much efficacy to the ordinance as we do.
