<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS UPON THE REVOLUTION IN FRANCE.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<P>THE late revolution in France is an event of the greate&s;t impor|tance. It has employed the pens of &s;everal able writers. Not find|ing, however, in any of them tho&s;e &s;entiments which I could alto|gether approve, I have been induced to publi&s;h my own.</P>
<P>There are two writers on the &s;ubject who have con&s;iderably en|gaged the attention of mankind, Mr. Burke and Mr. Paine. Mr. Burke, who is a man of con&s;iderable abilities and eloquence, has at|tacked the late revolution in France with a degree of acrimony which cannot &s;urely be with rea&s;on defended. His ob&s;ervations upon the politics of France, where they are unconnected with re|ligion, are, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, often &s;agacious and ju&s;t. When|ever he &s;peaks of religion, however, he &s;hows, that if he is not alto|gether, he is, almo&s;t, a papi&s;t. He &s;ays in &s;ome parts of his works that he was educated among&s;t monks, and that he has a great re|&s;pect for their character. His inclination to old religious e&s;tabli&s;h|ments, &s;hows it&s;elf very &s;oon in his fir&s;t pamphlet upon the &s;ubject of the late revolution, entitled "Reflections on the Revolution in France, &amp;c." He attacks the celebrated Dr. Price for a &s;ermon which he preached at the di&s;&s;enting meeting hou&s;e of the Old Jewry, London, on the 4th of November, 1789. The following pa&s;&s;age in the &s;ermon, which is worthy the pen of an apo&s;tle, is &s;everely animadverted upon by Mr. Burke. Dr. Price &s;ays&punc; "Tho&s;e who di&s;like that mode of wor&s;hip which is pre&s;cribed by public author|ity, ought, (if they can find no wor&s;hip <HI>out</HI> of the church which they approve) to &s;et up a &s;eparate wor&s;hip for them&s;elves, and by doing this, and giving an example of a rational and manly wor&s;hip, men of weight, from their rank and literature, may do the greate&s;t &s;ervice to &s;ociety and the world." See his &s;ermon.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke &s;ays, "The hint given to lay divines of <HI>rank and lite|rature</HI> may be proper and &s;ea&s;onable, though &s;omewhat new. If the noble &s;eekers &s;hould find nothing to &s;atisfy their pious fancies in the old &s;taple of the national church, or in all the rich variety to be found in the well-a&s;&s;orted ware-hou&s;es of the di&s;&s;enting congregati|ons,
<PB N="2" REF="025356_0005_0FCD0357B67B5F58">Dr. Price advi&s;es them to improve upon non-conformity; and to &s;et up, each of them, a &s;eparate meeting-hou&s;e upon his own particular principles. It is &s;omewhat remarkable that this reve|rend divine &s;hould be &s;o earne&s;t for &s;etting up new churches, and &s;o perfectly indifferent concerning the doctrine which may be taught in them. His zeal is of a curious character. It is not for the pro|pagation of his own opinions, but of any opinions. It is not for the diffu&s;ion of truth, but for the &s;preading of contradiction."</P>
<P>Mr. Burke in many parts of his writings avows him&s;elf a &s;trenu|ous advocate for a national e&s;tabli&s;hed church. He, perhaps, would prefer the church of Rome; but where that cannot be e&s;tabli&s;hed, would wi&s;h the church of England, from its being &s;omewhat &s;imi|lar. The church of Rome was e&s;tabli&s;hed in France. The king of that country was called the elde&s;t &s;on of the church; and the Ba&s;tille, though the French would not allow it, was another inqui|&s;ition. It is mo&s;t certain that many per&s;ons have been &s;ent to the Ba&s;tille for &s;peaking and writing again&s;t the Roman-catholic reli|gion. They have &s;uffered there the mo&s;t cruel tortures. A con|finement alone there, however, was almo&s;t &s;ufficient puni&s;hment for the wor&s;t crimes. As Mr. Burke is an advocate for the perpe|tual e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Roman catholic church in France, becau&s;e it has been e&s;tabli&s;hed there &s;everal centuries, it may be u&s;eful to ex|amine the principles of this church, fir&s;t, and then to make &s;ome ob&s;ervations upon the church of England. The Pope, the head of the Roman catholic church, we know from &s;cripture, rea&s;on, and experience, to be the enemy of God and man. This language may appear ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;h and violent to &s;ome, but if we inve&s;tigate the matter with due care and attention, we &s;hall find the language to be ju&s;tified by truth. St. Paul in his &s;econd epi&s;tle to the The&s;a|lonians &s;ays, that the day of Chri&s;t &s;hall not come "except there come a falling away fir&s;t, and that man of &s;in be revealed, the &s;on of perdition: who oppo&s;eth and exalteth him&s;elf above all that is called God or wor&s;hipped; &s;o that he as God &s;itteth in the temple of God, &s;howing him&s;elf that he is God. And now ye know what withholdeth, that he might be revealed in his time." Chap. 2. ver. 3&mdash;7. It is a&s;&s;erted by the celebrated Jo&s;eph Mede, and other learned writers, that the under&s;tanding Daniel's vi&s;ion of the four Monarchies, is of great con&s;equence to the interpretation of the &s;a|cred prophecies. Mr. Mede &s;ays, "The Roman empire to be the fourth kingdom of Daniel, was believed by the church of I&s;rael, both before and in our Saviour's time, received by the di&s;ciples of the apo&s;tles, and the whole chri&s;tian church for the fir&s;t 400 years, without any known contradiction. And, I confe&s;s, having &s;o good ground in &s;cripture, it is with me, tantum non articulus fidei, little le&s;s than an article of faith." On the Apocalyp&s;e, page 899, and 900, Folio.</P>
<P>With this point allowed, which &s;eems a fair datum, it will not be difficult to find, <HI>where,</HI> and, <HI>about what time,</HI> the man of &s;in aro&s;e. It was the Roman empire which withheld the man of &s;in from be|ing revealed. This was a doctrine adopted by Cyril, Chry&s;o&s;tom, Tertul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">an, and other learned writers in the earlier ages of chri&s;tian+ity. Daniel &s;ays, "the ten horns out of the fourth kingdom are ten kings that &s;hall ari&s;e: and another &s;hall ari&s;e after, and he &s;hall be diver&s;e from the fir&s;t." Chap. 7. ver. 24. The Roman empire was
<PB N="3" REF="025356_0006_0FCD035B55926A48">&s;hivered into a plurality of kingdoms, (as Mr. Mede expre&s;&s;es it) agreeably to the prophecy of Daniel, about the year 476. This is a circum&s;tance generally allowed by hi&s;torians and chronologi&s;ts. It was &s;ome time <HI>after</HI> that the little horn, that the eleventh king of Daniel, aro&s;e. And this we may confidently pronounce to be the &s;ame character as St. Paul's man of &s;in, and that they both &s;ignify the pope of Rome. They do not mean the bi&s;hop of Rome <HI>before,</HI> but, <HI>after,</HI> the apo&s;tacy. St. Paul prophecies of a mo&s;t deplorable &s;ece&s;&s;ion from the faith, before the man of &s;in &s;hould be revealed. He alludes to the &s;ame character al&s;o in the fir&s;t epi&s;tle to Timothy. "Now the &s;pirit &s;peaketh expre&s;sly, that in the latter times &s;ome &s;hall depart from the faith, giving heed to &s;educing &s;pirits and doc|trines of devils; &s;peaking lies in hypocri&s;y, having their con&s;cience &s;eared with a hot iron; forbidding to marry, and commanding to ab&s;tain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thank&s;giving of them which believe, and know the truth." Chap. 4. ver. 1&mdash;4. It may be u&s;eful to dwell upon the&s;e prophecies of St. Paul, not only to confirm the faith of the chri&s;tian, but to en|lighten the unbeliever. We &s;hall find them mo&s;t remarkably ful|filled. We &s;hall find that the bi&s;hop of Rome did <HI>oppo&s;e and exalt him&s;elf, above all that is called of God, or wor&s;hipped;</HI> that, <HI>he &s;at in the temple of God, at God.</HI> Du Moulin in a work entitled "New bricks for the building of Babel," a&s;&s;erts that Cayer, a popi&s;h wri|ter, maintained, que le pape doit e&s;tre ador&egrave;, "that the Pope &s;hould be adored." Some have prayed to him "O thou that take&s;t away the &s;ins of the world, have mercy upon us." The famous Ravaillac, who killed Henry the 4th of France, &s;aid "he yielded to the temptation which prompted him to kill the king, becau&s;e he made war again&s;t God, in as much as the pope is God, and God the pope." See his trial at the conclu&s;ion of Sully's Memoirs. This was a language which Ravaillac borrowed from the Domini|cans, with whom he was probably too intimate. Others al&s;o have called the pope, "my Lord God the pope." The pope <HI>oppo&s;ed and exalted him&s;elf above all that is called God,</HI> by &s;elling indulgences for the mo&s;t heinous crimes, and by this became eminently <HI>the Man of Sin.</HI> In the time of Luther, Tetzel a Dominican friar, was em|ployed by Pope Leo the tenth, to rai&s;e money by the &s;ale of indul|gences. Leo was a great admirer of the arts, and extravagant in other gratifications. He contrived this expedient to fill his coffers, which were emptied by his expen&s;ive inclinations. He was with rea&s;on &s;uppo&s;ed to be a Dei&s;t. He &s;ecretly laughed at that religion which he openly profe&s;&s;ed. <HI>He &s;poke lies in hypocri&s;y, having his con|&s;cience &s;eared with a hot iron.</HI> Tetzel publi&s;hed &s;ome di&s;cour&s;es upon indulgences, in which he &s;ays "The &s;ouls confined in purgatory, for who&s;e redemption indulgences are publi&s;hed, as &s;oon as the mo|ney tinkles in the che&s;t, in&s;tantly e&s;cape from that place of torment, and a&s;cend into Heaven." He &s;ays "for twelve pence you may redeem the &s;oul of your father out of Purgatory." The&s;e di&s;cour|&s;es have been &s;ince republi&s;hed, and are now extant. This is a&s;&s;er|ted by the celebrated hi&s;torian Dr. Robert&s;on, in his hi&s;tory of Charles the Vth. Vol. 2, page 80 and 81, quarto. Seckendorf, a writer of great repute among the Prote&s;tants, gives the form of the ab&s;olution u&s;ed by Tetzel, in which he &s;ays "May our Lord Je&s;us have mercy upon thee, and ab&s;olve thee by the merits of his mo&s;t
<PB N="4" REF="025356_0007_0FCD035C48B82998">holy pa&s;&s;ion. And I by his authority, that of his ble&s;&s;ed apo&s;tles Peter and Paul, and of the mo&s;t holy Pope, granted and commit|ted to me in the&s;e parts, do ab&s;olve thee, &amp;c. &amp;c." Dr. Mo&s;heim in that valuable work his Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory &s;ays that "Secken|dorf's incomparable hi&s;tory of Lutherani&s;m contains facts which are taken from the mo&s;t precious and authentic manu&s;cripts and records, contained in the library of Saxe Gotha, and in other learned and princely collections." Some have called the&s;e proceedings of Tet|zel the fooleries of a private per&s;on, and therefore reflecting no di&s;|grace upon the court of Rome. This, however, can by no means be admitted, if we pay the lea&s;t regard to the opinions of faithful and intelligent hi&s;torians; for they declare that Tetzel was in&s;tiga|ted and directed in his conduct by the Pope him&s;elf. A book was afterwards publi&s;hed at Rome, under the authority of the Popes, called Taxa Cancellariae Romanae, and was tran&s;lated into Engli&s;h under the title of "Rome a Great Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e for Sin." Dr. Robert&s;on refers to the Franckfort edition of this work in 1651; and &s;ays "The officers of the Roman chancery publi&s;hed a book, containing the preci&s;e &s;um to be exacted for the pardon of every particular &s;in. A deacon guilty of murder, was ab&s;olved for twenty crowns. A bi&s;hop or abbot might a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate for three hundred li|vres. An eccle&s;ia&s;tic might commit uncleanline&s;s, though with the mo&s;t aggravating circum&s;tances, for a third part of that &s;um." See Hi&s;tory of Charles the Vth. Vol. 2, page 105, quarto, and the various authorities cited in that page. This price-current, as it has been wittily called, has been often altered, from the caprice of the Popes, or from an alteration in the value of money. It has been contended by catholic writers that the church of Rome does not &s;ignify by indulgences the permi&s;&s;ion or the forgivene&s;s of &s;ins, but a relea&s;ement from canonical penances, after &s;incere repentance, and the &s;acrament of penance. Cardinal Bellarmine, who wrote &s;everal volumes in folio upon the principles of the Roman catholics, and was e&s;teemed among them a pillar of orthodoxy, &s;ays of the Pope, &s;ed in poenam purgatorii, immo etiam in poenam eternam Gehennae, &s;ine dubio pote&s;tatem habet, &s;altem con&s;equenter &amp; indirecte, quia dum ab&s;olvit per &s;acramentum poenitentiae, a culp&acirc; lethali, liberat con&s;equenter hominem a debito poena &s;empiternae; &amp; in eodem mo|do dum per indulgentias ab&s;olvit hominem a poenitenti&acirc; injuct&acirc; vel injungenda, ab&s;olvit eundem con&s;equenter a poen&acirc; purgatorii, quam is luiturus e&s;&s;et, &s;i cam poen&acirc; non explevi&s;&s;et, vel ab e&acirc; ab&s;olutus non fui&s;&s;et. Bellarm. de Indulgentiis, Lib. 1. Cap. 6.</P>
<P>"He indi&s;putably has power over the torments of purgatory, and over the eternal torments of hell, at lea&s;t con&s;equently and in|directly, becau&s;e while he ab&s;olves, by the &s;acrament of penance, from mortal &s;in, he con&s;equently &s;ecures from the pains of eternal puni&s;hment; and in the &s;ame manner, when by indulgences he ab|&s;olves a man from penance, enjoined, or to be enjoined, he con&s;e|quently ab&s;olves the &s;ame man from the pains of purgatory, which he would &s;uffer, if he had not &s;atisfied them by penance, or had not been ab&s;olved from them." The cardinal &s;ays here that the Pope by indulgences can ab&s;olve from the &s;acrament of penance, and the pains of purgatory. This &s;urely is more than a relea&s;ement from canonical penances. In &s;hort, the truth &s;eems to be this, the for|mer doctrines about indulgences, which were e&s;teemed orthodox,
<PB N="5" REF="025356_0008_0FCD035DB5F5CC08">are &s;o mon&s;trou&s;ly ab&s;urd, that &s;ome modern defenders of the Ro|man catholic church are willing, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hen &s;peaking of them, to deny, or to e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ade, wherever they can. That St. Paul means the church of Rome, by what he &s;ays in the fir&s;t epi&s;tle to Timothy, as well as by what he &s;ays in his &s;econd epi&s;tle to the The&s;&s;alonians, is what every impartial and intelligent per&s;on mu&s;t allow. He &s;ays, <HI>that in the latter times &s;ome &s;hall depart from the faith, forbidding to marry, and commanding to ab&s;tain from meats.</HI> The&s;e circum&s;tances &s;eem characteri&s;tic of, <HI>peculiar to,</HI> the Roman Catholic Church. It is &s;aid in a Roman catholic catechi&s;m, which was printed at Dub|lin, in 1782. "<HI>Q.</HI> How many are the commandments of the church? <HI>A.</HI> Six. <HI>Q.</HI> Say the &s;ix commandments of the church. <HI>A.</HI> 1. To hear ma&s;s on &s;undays and holy days. 2. To fa&s;t and ab|&s;tain on the days commanded. 3. To confe&s;s our &s;ins at lea&s;t once a year. 4. To receive at Ea&s;ter or thereabout. 5. To pay tithes to our pa&s;tors. 6. Not to &s;olemnize marriage <HI>within forbidden times</HI> or forbidden degrees of kindred." See le&s;&s;on 25. It has been a&s;|&s;erted by the defenders of the Roman catholic church that the for|bidding to marry, and commanding to ab&s;tain from meats, are not peculiar to them; for that &s;everal &s;ects in the early ages of chri&s;ti|anity maintained the &s;ame doctrines. It is to be ob&s;erved, how|ever, that St. Paul refers to the <HI>latter times;</HI> and it may rea&s;on|ably be concluded that he alludes to the &s;ame &s;eceders from the faith who were to ari&s;e after the Roman empire &s;hould be divided, and the <HI>man of &s;in</HI> &s;hould be revealed. There is now no &s;ect of chri&s;|tians, excepting the Roman catholics, who forbid to marry, and command to ab&s;tain from meats. It is at particular times that they forbid the laity, and, at all times, the prie&s;ts, to marry. The pro|te&s;tants contend that it is unrea&s;onable to debar the clergy from marriage, becau&s;e &s;ome of the apo&s;tles were actually married men. St. Paul &s;ays "marriage is honourable <HI>in all,</HI> and the bed undefi|led." By &s;aying that tho&s;e who admini&s;ter the go&s;pel &s;hould not marry, the papi&s;ts reflect upon the conduct of tho&s;e apo&s;tles who had wives, and are altogether incon&s;i&s;tent and ab&s;urd. The famous Cardinal Bellarmine makes a curious argument again&s;t marriage, by a bewildered interpretation of a pa&s;&s;age in the Revelation of St. John. I call it a bewildered interpretation, though I allow in ma|ny re&s;pects the talents, the learning, and above all the elegant Latin, of the Cardinal. He &s;ays the locu&s;ts in the ninth chapter of Revela|tions, who are repre&s;ented as coming out of the bottomle&s;s pit, with a &s;moke, and darkening the &s;un and air, are the Lutherans. He &s;ays a locu&s;t is a greedy devouring animal, like a Lutheran, not temperate like a Catholic; and that when men indulge them&s;elves in meats and luxurious living, they are naturally provoked to the incontinence of marriage. In this he meant to arraign the conduct of Luther, who eat meat, without regard to particular days or times of the year, and who married a nun. Though I do not think that all the religious opinions of Milton are orthodox, yet I admire his &s;entiments upon the legality of marriage to all mankind, as he &s;ays,
<Q><L>Whatever hypocrites au&s;terely talk,</L>

In this no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e it is &s;aid that the apo&s;tle meant "let marriage be honoura|ble in all, and the bed undefiled," that is, let married people ab&s;tain from tho&s;e irregularities which are a di&s;grace to the &s;anctity of the marriage bed. This is good doctrine to be &s;ure, but is not what the Apo&s;tle here meant. He meant in this pa&s;|&s;age of his epi&s;tle to the Hebrews to allow marriage to all men, by what he &s;ays in the fir&s;t quoted pa&s;&s;age from his epi&s;tle to the Corinthians.</NOTE> If the learned reader, however, will examine the original Greek, he will find the tran&s;lation to be altogether ju&s;t and unexceptionable. As futile and as erroneous are the objections of the papi&s;ts to the tran&s;lation of the following pa&s;&s;age, in the &s;ame epi&s;tle of St. Paul, "it is better to marry than to burn." Chap. 7. ver. 9. St. Paul tells us that St. Peter was a married man. The Pope, by &s;aying that no mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel &s;hould marry, reflects upon the con|duct of his pretended predece&s;&s;or. I will allow, however, that in &s;ome ca&s;es St. Paul recommends to a mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel, if he has the gift of continence, not to marry. The Roman catholics de|vote all their prie&s;ts to celibacy, whether they have or have not the gift of continence. Some of their writers, however, &s;ay that they recommend to none to become prie&s;ts except they have the gift of continence. In fact, though, the incontinence of their prie&s;ts has been &s;o great as to become proverbial. I appeal to hi&s;tory and expe|rience. It is not only the clergy that they have confined to the &s;ingle life, but a va&s;t body of monks and nuns. In France their number was prodigious. The con&s;equence of this was that it hap|pened to multitudes of tho&s;e who were &s;ecluded from marriage, as it happened to many of the Gentiles before the propagation of the go&s;pel, whom, (to u&s;e the words of the apo&s;tle) "God gave up
<PB N="7" REF="025356_0010_0FCD0360C0052080">unto vile affections; for even the women did change the natural u&s;e into that which is again&s;t nature: and likewi&s;e al&s;o the men, leaving the natural u&s;e of the woman, burned in their lu&s;t one toward ano|ther, men with men working that which is un&s;eemly." Romans i. 26, 27.&mdash;It would be ungenerous and unrea&s;onable to &s;ay that all the Roman catholics who have been unmarried have been addic|ted to irregular or unhallowed lu&s;ts. Some have known to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves "in &s;anctification and honour." Yet the &s;y&s;tem which indi&s;criminately devotes millions to celibacy is cruel, and wicked; and they, whoever they are, that defend it, are not without fault. The mona&s;teries and nunneries in France, like tho&s;e in other parts of the world, were the nur&s;eries of &s;loth and vice. They were filled with a &s;et of people, the determined enemies of their coun|try, from their determined re&s;olution to continue the eccle&s;ia&s;tical tyranny which was exerci&s;ed over it. At the time of the reforma|tion in Scotland, the celebrated preacher John Knox, who was <HI>a &s;on of thunder,</HI> u&s;ed to &s;ay that the be&s;t way of clearing the king|dom from the Romi&s;h prie&s;ts, was to de&s;troy their mona&s;teries and abbeys, "that if their ne&s;ts were de&s;troyed, the rooks would &s;oon leave the country." In the time of Knox, the prote&s;tants in Scot|land went further than is now nece&s;&s;ary in France; they demoli&s;hed the very buildings of the Roman catholic &s;ocieties. The &s;ame ad|vantage may be gained by converting the building of a mona&s;tery to a new u&s;e, as by its actual demolition. When however the e&s;|tate and property belonging to it are &s;eized, and its old inhabi|tants are turned out, they &s;hould not be left to peri&s;h, but &s;hould have a proper annuity regularly paid to them. The mi&s;chiefs which were often produced in &s;ociety by the prevention of prie&s;ts from marriage, may be &s;een in the hi&s;tory of the celebrated Abelard and Eloi&s;a. He &s;educes her, but is willing to marry her. She di&s;|&s;uades him from marriage, le&s;t it &s;hould prevent his preferment in the church, and &s;ays expre&s;sly (&s;ee her letters) that &s;he would ra|ther be his mi&s;tre&s;s than his wife. Mr. Pope, in that pernicious poem which he has produced on the &s;ubject, with no inju&s;tice to her character, repre&s;ents her wickedly &s;aying,
<Q><LG>
<L>How oft, when pre&s;t to marriage have I &s;aid,</L>

<P>It is the well known doctrine of the church of Rome, that a prie&s;t had better commit fornication than marry. Bellarmine &s;ays that marriage is wor&s;e than fornication in a prie&s;t, becau&s;e it renders him unable to keep the vow which he has &s;worn to maintain; red|dit eum inhabilem ad votum &s;ervandum.&mdash;See Bellar. De Mona|chis, Lib. 2. Cap. 24.&mdash;</P>
<P>Such a doctrine as this has a tendency to fill the world with whores and &s;ons of whores. The new con&s;titution of France, I

<P>I &s;uppo&s;e it will be acknowledged by all mankind that the Roman catholics <HI>command to ab&s;tain from meats.</HI> This is done in oppo&s;i|tion to the expre&s;s direction of St. Paul, who &s;ays in the tenth chapter of the fir&s;t epi&s;tle to the Corinthians, "What&s;oever is &s;old in the &s;hambles, that eat, a&s;king no que&s;tions for con&s;cience &s;ake." If we apply to the Engli&s;h dictionary, we &s;hall find the explanation of &s;hambles to be "a butchery, a place to buy meat at." In objection to this, however, it may be &s;aid, that the Ro|man catholic church only forbids the u&s;e of meat on <HI>certain</HI> days, and not on every day. Here again St. Paul will an&s;wer for us, who &s;ays in the epi&s;tle to the Colo&s;&s;ians, "Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in re&s;pect of an holy day." The Roman catholics in &s;ome countries have burnt, or otherwi&s;e put to death, men for eating a goo&s;e or a bit of bacon on a fa&s;t-day They have burnt per&s;ons for having the Lord's prayer, or the ten commandments, in their mother-tongue. The celebrated Bo&s;&s;uet, bi&s;hop of Meaux, is an advocate for "the exerci&s;e of the &s;word in matters of religion and con&s;cience" and &s;ays it is "A thing which in truth cannot be called in que&s;tion, without enervat|ing and as it were maiming the power of the legi&s;lature. So that there cannot be a more dangerous illu&s;ion than to fix &s;uffering for a characteri&s;tic of the true church." See the end of his &s;econd vo|lume of averti&s;&s;ements again&s;t Jurieu. The Roman catholic mi&s;|&s;ionaries in Aby&s;&s;inia, upon &s;ome oppo&s;ition &s;aid, we mu&s;t rai&s;e a civil war to promote our religion. In &s;hort, it would almo&s;t freeze the heart with horror, and almo&s;t fill the world with books, if we were to tell of the cruelties and murders with which the papi&s;ts, through a mi&s;guided zeal, have vexed and polluted all the countries of the world. If we con&s;ider the&s;e circum&s;tances, we &s;hall find that the man of &s;in foretold by St. Paul, as well as the eleventh king of Daniel, who was to "wear out the &s;aints of the Mo&s;t High" and the per&s;ecuting character de&s;cribed by St. John in the Revela|tion, all &s;ignify the Pope of Rome. St. John repre&s;ents his cha|racter under the emblem of a who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, <HI>drunken with the blood of the &s;aints,</HI> and &s;eated <HI>on &s;even mountains.</HI> And again he &s;ays "and the woman, which thou &s;awe&s;t is that great city which reigneth over the kings of the earth." See Revelation, chap. 17. ver. 18. It is well known to tho&s;e who have read the Latin authors that they call Rome the city of &s;even hills.&mdash;Martial, among others, writes to this purpo&s;e, and &s;ays,
<Q><L>Hine &s;eptem Dominos videre Montes,</L>

<P>It was for a long time denied by the Roman catholic writers that St. John, in this pa&s;&s;age, which we have ju&s;t quoted, meant Rome. The mo&s;t learned of them have for &s;ome time, however, acknowledged that Rome is here &s;ignified, (&s;ee on this &s;ubject the celebrated Durham on the Revelation, Page 667) and confe&s;&s;ed
<PB N="9" REF="025356_0012_0FCD03653923C6F0">that they could make no other interpretation. Some apply the prophecy to heathen Rome, and &s;ome to what Rome &s;uffered under the Goths. That it cannot mean heathen Rome is mo&s;t certain, becau&s;e St. John &s;ays that he, is to foretell things which were to come to pa&s;s after the time he was writing. St. John, cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to be an hi&s;torian who was to relate pa&s;t events. The prophecy in this chapter of Revelation cannot re|late to what Rome &s;uffered under the Goths, becau&s;e it is &s;aid that tho&s;e empires which &s;hould de&s;troy the papal power, &s;hould be tho&s;e which had formerly &s;upported it. See ver&s;es 16 &amp; 17 of this chap|ter. The Goths had never &s;upported it. France, as well as every other power which has &s;upported it, will before long, (if the pro|phecies of Daniel and St. John are true<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See "Ob&s;ervations upon the Downfal of the Papal Power, and the Con&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|quent Events. By Charles Crawford, <ABBR>E&s;qr</ABBR>"</NOTE>,) agree to accompli&s;h its total extirpation.</P>
<P>It appears from &s;cripture, that though the patience of the &s;aints was for a long time to be exerci&s;ed in bearing the tyranny of the court of Rome, yet they are at la&s;t commanded to re&s;i&s;t her by force. "Reward her even as &s;he rewarded you, and double unto her double." Revelation, chap. 18. ver. 6. It has been &s;up|po&s;ed by many per&s;ons who are of the peaceable &s;ects of chri&s;ti|ans, that the papal power is at la&s;t violently to be aboli&s;hed, but they can &s;carcely believe that the work is to be done by the &s;aints. We &s;hall be convinced, however, of this truth, if we attend to the preceding words in this chapter. It is &s;aid "come out of her my people, that ye be not partakers of her &s;ins." See ver&s;es 4 &amp; 5. Tho&s;e therefore who do not partake of her fins, namely the people of God, are to be among the executioners of this predicted wrath.</P>
<P>It is difficult to eradicate from the minds of Roman catholics the prejudice that their church is the true, becau&s;e it is the mo&s;t antient. St. Paul, as we have mentioned, prophecies of a mo&s;t deplorable falling away, and departing from the faith; and this happened with the bi&s;hops of Rome. For the doctrines inculcat|ed by them about the conclu&s;ion of the &s;ixth century were directly oppo&s;ite to the doctrines of the apo&s;tles. The Roman catholics have violently contended that Peter was &s;uperior to his brethren, that he was the prince of the apo&s;tles. This was a doctrine to which our Saviour expre&s;sly mentions his &s;trong di&s;like. He &s;ays to his di&s;ciples, "Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exer|ci&s;e dominion over them, and they that are great, exerci&s;e authori|ty upon them. But it &s;hall not be &s;o among you; but who&s;oever will be great among you, let him be your mini&s;ter". Matth. 20.25, 26. It is true he &s;ays to Peter, that he <HI>is the rock upon which be will build his church,</HI> and that he will <HI>give unto him the keys of the kingdom of heaven.</HI> Yet we cannot rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e that he meant to exalt Peter above his brethren, for he tells them to call no man ma&s;ter. The&s;e expre&s;&s;ions were applicable to each of the apo&s;tles, excepting Judas. If, however, we were to &s;ix on any one apo&s;tle as &s;uperior to the re&s;t, it would not be Peter. St. Paul &s;ays that he <HI>laboured more abundantly than all.</HI> St. John &s;eems to
<PB N="10" REF="025356_0013_0FCD0366CDA1DE40">have approached our Saviour more in purity of mind than Peter, and to have been more beloved by him. He at his crucifixion recommends to John to con&s;ider his mother as his own. John u&s;ed to lie in his bo&s;om when they were at table, and to have more of his ear when living than the re&s;t. To John he gave the Revelation which God had given to him, which with the Go&s;pel he wrote, go further (though great re&s;pect &s;hould be had to the latter zeal of Peter) towards building up his church, than Peter's two epi&s;|tles. Some doubt whether St. Peter ever was at Rome. If he was there, he was not bi&s;hop of the place. If he had been bi&s;hop, however, it is immaterial to the cau&s;e of the pope. It does not &s;ignify whether or not a man is &s;ucce&s;&s;or in the place where St. Peter was bi&s;hop, if he teaches a different doctrine. If he was an <HI>angel from heaven,</HI> and in that place, he would <HI>be accur&s;ed</HI> under &s;uch circum&s;tances. St. Peter and the apo&s;tles taught that mar|riage was honorable in all men, whether mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel or not. The pope &s;ays that no clergyman, whether he has the gift, of continence or not, &s;hould marry. The binding a mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel by a vow not to do what is lawful to every man, is as wicked as tyrannical. The apo&s;tles &s;ay we may eat meat on eve|ry day of the week. The pope has &s;aid that we &s;hould be b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rnt and damned if we eat it on <HI>certain</HI> days. The apo&s;tles were con|tented with little, and propagated the go&s;pel "without money, and without price." The popes riot in every luxury, and will violently take the goods of others. I &s;carcely know in what points the bi&s;hops of Rome imitate their pretended predece&s;&s;or St. Peter, except that they <HI>cur&s;e</HI> and <HI>&s;wear</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> he did when he denied his ma&s;ter. In cur&s;ing and &s;wearing, they outdo Peter, and all man|kind. On a day, which they call Maundy Thur&s;day, they cur&s;e (or they u&s;ed to cur&s;e) all the good people in the world; and I do believe, if ever the&s;e hallowed pages &s;hould reach Rome, that neither they not their pious author would be &s;ecluded from the common execration. In the old and new te&s;taments we are frequently com|manded to avoid idolatry. The apo&s;tles repre&s;ent it as a crime of the fir&s;t magnitude, and that tho&s;e who commit it have no place in the kingdom of heaven. The decalogue &s;ays "Thou &s;halt not make to thee any graven image&mdash;thou &s;halt not bow down thy&s;elf to them, nor &s;erve them. For I the Lord thy God am a jealous God." The council of Trent &s;ays "that images &s;hould have due honor and wor&s;hip given them for tho&s;e they repre&s;ent; as not only putting off the hat, but falling down before them." And the Roman catechi&s;m &s;ays that "images &s;hould be wor&s;hip|ped." This conduct of the papi&s;ts is &s;o flagrantly and palpably contradictory to that part of the decalogue which I have quoted; that they have thought it prudent in their common prayer books to print the decalogue without this part of it. This is an indi&s;puta|ble fact, and can be proved at once by an appeal to the liturgies of the church of Rome, to liturgies printed under the authority of the pope. The plea, that this was done for the &s;ake of brevity, is altogether un&s;atisfactory, as the whole of the decalogue is but &s;hort, and every part is of the greate&s;t importance. The papi&s;ts call the vir|gin Mary the queen of heaven, regina coeli, laetare, alleluiah. This is an expre&s;&s;ion borrowed from the idolatrous language of the hea|thens. They pray to her &s;ometimes as to a deity, and not as to a
<PB N="11" REF="025356_0014_0FCD03689BE87090">mediator or interce&s;&s;or. Their prayers to the virgin Mary as an interce&s;&s;or, are ince&s;&s;ant and innumerable; notwith&s;tanding what St. Paul has &s;aid that "there is one God, and one Mediator be|tween God and Man." 1 Timothy, 2; 5. They have "the ro&s;a|ry of the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, and the litany of our lady of Loretto." They call the virgin Mary our Lady of Loretto, becau&s;e, as they &s;ay, &s;ome angels took the hou&s;e, in which &s;he lived in the holy land, to Loretto, in Italy. The Roman catholics al&s;o (I defy contra|diction for I write with their prayer book before me) pray to St. Fabran and St. Seba&s;tian, to St. Gerva&s;e, and St. Prota&s;e, to St. Beroard, and St. Dominick, as interce&s;&s;ors. I like the praying to St. Dominick the lea&s;t of all their prayers, becau&s;e I think him one of the wor&s;t men that ever exi&s;ted. It is &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary to mention to men of any reading that he is commonly called the founder of the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I would recommend the reader to the "Hi&s;tory of the Inqui&s;ition, by Phi|lip a Lim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch."

I hope too many do not think with Cardinal Bellarmine, that this &s;courge of the human race (of who&s;e mother we may &s;ay, as Ci|cero finely &s;ays of the mother of Mark Anthony when &s;he produc|ed him, O mi&s;erae mulieris fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cunditatem calamito&s;am!) indi&s;puta|bly performed miracles. I will mention another in&s;tance of the idolatry of the Roman catholics. At the elevation of the ho&s;t they &s;ay "Mo&s;t adorable body, I adore thee with all the powers of my &s;oul." Some of the popi&s;h writers acknowledge, that if the real pre&s;ence was not contained in the &s;acrament, their church would be guilty of as gro&s;s idolatry as ever was practi&s;ed, by the hea|thens. As this is a matter of great importance. I will make &s;ome further ob&s;ervations upon it. It may be proved by arguments as convincing to a candid mind as mathematical demon&s;tration, that the real pre&s;ence is not contained in the &s;acrament, and therefore that the papi&s;ts are flagrant idolators. In the creed of Pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> 4th. before his elevation to the papal chair, which by Roman catho|lics is thought the e&s;&s;ence of orthodoxy, it is &s;aid "I do profe&s;s that in the mo&s;t holy &s;acrament of the euchari&s;t, there is troly, really and &s;ub&s;tantially, the body and blood, together with the &s;oul and divinity, of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and that there is a con|ver&s;ion made of the whole &s;ub&s;tance of the bread into the body, and of the whole &s;ub&s;tance of the wine into the blood; which conver&s;ion the Catholic Church calls tran&s;ub&s;tantiation." Some prote&s;tant writers have u&s;ed as &s;trong an argument again&s;t tran&s;ub|&s;tantiation, as can be u&s;ed again&s;t any error whatever. It is obvious to every one, it cannot be controverted, that our Saviour his &s;elf
<PB N="12" REF="025356_0015_0FCD0369D014F180">in&s;tituted the &s;acrament? Now &s;ay the prote&s;tants, could he eat his own body, and drink his own blood? If the bread had by our Saviour been converted into fle&s;h, and the wine into blood, it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that his di&s;ciples would have made &s;ome &s;cruples about eating human fle&s;h, and drinking human blood. His di&s;ciples were Jews, who by the law were &s;trictly commanded not to ta&s;te the blood even of tho&s;e animals who&s;e fle&s;h they eat. And it is the cu&s;tom of the Jews at this day, to &s;queeze the meat which they eat till it is altogether free from blood. If therefore the di&s;ciples did not he&s;itate in any man|ner at taking the &s;acrament in the way it was admini&s;tered by their Lord, we have a right to conclude that they thought him &s;peak|ing <HI>figuratively</HI> and not <HI>literally,</HI> when he called the bread his body and the wine his blood, as when he called him&s;elf <HI>a door</HI> and <HI>a vine.</HI> The apo&s;tles, after the death of our Saviour, agreed that the con|verted Gentiles were not to be bound to circumci&s;ion, but were to "keep them&s;elves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from things &s;trangled, and from fornication." It chri&s;tians are to ab&s;tain from the blood of a bea&s;t, &s;hould they be allowed to drink the blood of a man? If the bread in the &s;acrament is converted into the real body of Chri&s;t, &s;hould not we expect to &s;ee a body di&s;tingui&s;hable by head, and hands, and feet, in&s;tead of a round ma&s;s of bread? If an experiment were made upon common and what is called con&s;ecrated bread and wine, would they not grow mouldy and &s;our in the &s;ame proportion of time? That there is a conver&s;ion, in the manner Roman catholics contend, in the &s;a|crament, implies the power in the wor&s;t of men of working a mira|cle, whenever they plea&s;e. The candid part of them mu&s;t allow that &s;ome of their clergy and &s;ome of their popes have been pollut|ed with every vice of which human nature is capable; that (accord|ing to the expre&s;&s;ion of the prophet) <HI>from the &s;ole of the foot, even unto the head, there has been no &s;oundne&s;s, but wounds, and brui&s;es, and putrifying &s;ores.</HI> And I will allow that &s;ome of the clergy, as well as the laity, of their communion, have been remarkable for their virtues. Who can read the works of the celebrated Prince of Conti without being &s;truck with his many amiable virtues? He contends again&s;t the immoral tendency of the &s;tage with the purity of a primitive chri&s;tian. St. Paul &s;ays in his &s;e|cond epi&s;tle to the The&s;&s;alonians that &s;ome of tho&s;e who followed "the man of &s;in, were to follow him with the deceivablene&s;s of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s." By which phra&s;e, I conceive he meant, that they were to &s;uppo&s;e them&s;elves doing right when doing wrong. To re|turn to my ob&s;ervations relative to tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, I think it has been well ob&s;erved that God made man, but man can never make God. It is mo&s;t certain that the popi&s;h prie&s;ts bla&s;phemou&s;|ly and wickedly &s;ay that the bread which they have con&s;ecrated is God, that it has the power of working miracles, a power which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> irre&s;i&s;tible. I have a curious pamphlet in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion "The &s;chool of the Euchari&s;t" written by a Je&s;uit, and publi&s;hed, with licen&s;e, in Fren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, at Lille, in 1672. It was afterwards publi&s;h|ed in Engli&s;h, by Dr. Clagett, in 1687.

Among other in&s;tances he &s;ays, "<HI>A fox quits the hen he had carried away by virtue of the holy &s;acrament.</HI> St. Gregory the pope tells us that St. Boniface, whil&s;t he was a young child, &s;tanding at the door of his lodging, he perceived a fox running away with a hen in his mouth. Immediately away he went to the church, and placing him&s;elf before the holy &s;acrament, he made this prayer to it. "Lord, I be&s;eech thee to pre&s;erve the pullen which my mother feeds in her back yard, for the &s;u&s;tenance of her little family." Having done this he returned to his lodging, where this fox appeared again with the hen in his mouth, and laying down the hen, fell down dead at the feet of this child. S. Gregor. Dialog. lib. 1."

<P>Such being the principles of the Roman catholics, I cannot agree with Mr. Burke that it was impious and wicked in the French to overthrow their church. Mr. Burke makes frequent and bitter lamentation through all his pamphlets relative to the French revo|lution, for the de&s;truction of this church. It was therefore perti|nent, it was ad rem, when treating of the revolution, to mention the principles of the Roman catholic church. A great deal of the que&s;tion relative to the propriety or impropriety of the revolu|tion, is involved in the que&s;tion, whether the Roman catholic re|ligion is true or not. It is agreed by all prote&s;tant commentators of note upon the prophecies (among whom we may reckon Sir I&s;aac Newton and Jo&s;eph Mede) that the Roman catholic church is to continue 1260 years<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See on this &s;ubject my before-mentioned Pamphlet on the Downfall of the Papal Power.&mdash;</NOTE> Many learned commentators on &s;cripture &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e 1260 years are nearly expired. If their &s;uppo&s;itions be ju&s;t, the French revolution is the precur&s;or to the total and final extirpation of the papal power, and has been brought about by divine appointment that the prophecies may be fulfilled.&mdash;In &s;ay|ing this, however, I would not wi&s;h to be under&s;tood as meaning that the whole of this matter has been effected by hallowed hands. It is a judicious ob&s;ervation of Sir I&s;aac Newton that the Almighty will &s;uffer infidelity as well as true religion at la&s;t to extirpate the errors and abominations of popery.&mdash;God may &s;ometimes execute his wrath by his children, or he may make the wicked &s;ometimes the in&s;truments of that wrath. He may execute his wrath &s;ome|times by the means of both.&mdash;Mr Burke &s;eems to have a violent prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in favor of the Roman catholic religion, which has mi&s;led his judgment relative to the French revolution. He &s;ays in his letter to the archbi&s;hop of Aix "your church, the intelli|gence of which was the ornament of the chri&s;tian world in its pro&s;perity, is now more brilliant in the moment of its misfor|tunes, to the eyes who are capable of judging of it." And again Mr. Burke &s;ays in the &s;ame letter "maintain, Sir, the courage which you have hitherto &s;hown; and be per&s;uaded that though the world is not worthy of you and your colleagues, we are not all in&s;en&s;ible to the honor which you do to our common nature." I think it would be difficult for <HI>a profe&s;&s;ed catholic</HI> to &s;ay any thing more deci&s;ive in favor of his religion. The&s;e colleagues of the
<PB N="14" REF="025356_0017_0FCD036F6DED2808">archbi&s;hop of Aix, of whom the world is not worthy, were (however amiable in &s;ome re&s;pects in private life) the &s;upporters of the mo&s;t pe&s;tilent &s;uper&s;tition that the world ever &s;aw.&mdash;A part of this horrible &s;y&s;tem of &s;uper&s;tition I have de&s;cribed in the pre|ceding pages. To de&s;cribe more would be inconvenient in a work like this.&mdash;Mr. Burke &s;eems to imagine that all the oppo&s;ition to the religious e&s;tabli&s;hment in France has proceeded from athei&s;m or from dei&s;m, that it has been made "in a drunken delirium from the hot &s;pirit drawn out of the alembick of hell."&mdash;The oppo&s;ition to the religious e&s;tabli&s;hment was unitedly made by de|i&s;ts and by chri&s;tians. Mr. Rabaut de St. Etienne on the follow|ing motion which was made by the Comte de Caftellane in the Na|tional A&s;&s;embly "no man &s;hall be mole&s;ted for his opinions, or in|terrupted in the exerci&s;e of his religion," &s;ays that his con&s;titu|ents "are a juri&s;diction (&s;en&eacute;cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;&eacute;e) of three hundred and &s;ix|ty thou&s;and inhabitants, of whom more than one hundred and twenty thou&s;and are prote&s;tants." He &s;ays in the &s;ame &s;peech, that there are two millions of prote&s;tants in the kingdom of France.&mdash;Me&s;&s;ieurs Condorcet and Pey&s;onnel compute the prote&s;|tants to be three millions.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke appears to be an ob&s;tinate advocate for a church e&s;ta|bli&s;hment. He &s;ays in his fir&s;t pamphlet on the French revolution "Fir&s;t I beg leave to &s;peak of our church e&s;tabli&s;hment, which is the fir&s;t of our prejudices, not a prejudice de&s;titute of rea&s;on, but involving in it profound and exten&s;ive wi&s;dom. I &s;peak of it fir&s;t. It is fir&s;t, and la&s;t, and mid&s;t in our minds. For taking ground on that religious &s;y&s;tem, of which we are now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, we continue to act on the early received, and uniformly continued &s;en&s;e of mankind." And again he &s;ays "the con&s;ecration of the &s;tate, by a &s;tate religious e&s;tabli&s;hment, is nece&s;&s;ary al&s;o to operate with a whole&s;ome awe upon free citizen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">." A church e&s;tabli&s;hment im|plies that men &s;hould preach the go&s;pel for hire, and that the clergy have a right to collect tithes from the people. Which things are expre&s;sly forbidden by the go&s;pel. Our Saviour &s;aid to his di&s;ciples "freely ye have received, freely give." St. Paul &s;ays that "the&s;e hands have mini&s;tered to my nece&s;&s;ities." The mak|ing a bargain before-hand for what a man &s;hall receive for preach|ing, the making it a profe&s;&s;ion whereby he is to obtain a livelihood, has no foundation in chri&s;tianity. The tithes by which the clergy are &s;upported, are forbidden in the new te&s;tament, and are injuri|ous to liberty, and to agriculture, which is one of the noble&s;t and mo&s;t beneficial employments to mankind. St. Paul &s;ays (&s;peaking of things under the Mo&s;aic di&s;pen&s;ation) "and verily they that are of the &s;ons of Levi, who receive the office of the prie&s;thood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people, according to the law." Hebrews, chap. 7. ver. 5. And &s;oon after he &s;ays "for the prie&s;thood being changed, there is made of nece&s;&s;ity a change al&s;o of the law. For he of whom the&s;e things are &s;poken per|taineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar. For it is evident that our Lord &s;prang out of Judah; of which tribe Mo&s;es &s;pake nothing concerning the prie&s;thood." Ver|&s;es, 12, 13, 14.&mdash;That the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel in the pre&s;ent day have a right to tithes, like the Levites of old, will appear by no means rea&s;onable, if we con&s;ider the origin of tithes under the
<PB N="15" REF="025356_0018_0FCD0371573715B0">Mo&s;aic Law. The levites were one of the tribes of I&s;rael, and were to have tithes in&s;tead of a &s;hare of the land, which they had a right to in common with their brethren. The prie&s;ts, who &s;erv|ed at the altar, were allowed but a tenth part of the tithes. The nine other parts were allotted to the general body of the Levites, and to be kept for widows and &s;trangers.&mdash;The clergy of our day who receive tithes, inherit, like other men, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their ance&s;tors, and &s;ome of them con&s;iderable e&s;tates, and yet will take the whole tithes, and give what they plea&s;e, and perhaps but little to the widow and the &s;tranger. Tithes and circumci&s;ion, parts of the old law, are equally abli&s;hed by the New Te&s;tament; and it would be as rea&s;onable in the clergy to circumci&s;e us by force, as to take our property for tithes in the &s;ame violent manner.&mdash;It is mo&s;t certain that tithes were not demanded in the times of the pri|mitive chri&s;tians, but were extorted by the papal power. Mon|te&s;quieu and other learned writers &s;uppo&s;e that they were fir&s;t in|troduced in the time of Charlemagne, about the year of our Lord 800.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tithes were introduced into England about 833, by Ethelwolf, the father of the celebrated Alhed, who was led by Romi&s;h prie&s;ts, and went in per&s;on to Rome.

<P>A &s;tate religious e&s;tabli&s;hment has a mi&s;chievous effect introduc|ing a te&s;t, which tempts men to perjury, if they are di&s;hone&s;t, or which, if they are hone&s;t, deprives the commonwealth of the benefit of their talents. A religious te&s;t cau&s;es frequent emigra|tions from a country, and brings down numberle&s;s cur&s;es upon it. It favors of the the malignant &s;pirit of popery, and is arrant per|&s;ecution.
<PB N="16" REF="025356_0019_0FCD0372C5691220">&mdash;The French con&s;titution therefore wi&s;ely gave free li|berty to all men "of exerci&s;ing the religious wor&s;hip to which they were attached" and has wi&s;ely admitted men of all denomina|tions of religion to the offices of government. I think al&s;o that the French have been wi&s;e in making no political di&s;tinction be|tween a Jewi&s;h and a Chri&s;tian citizen. I think that there &s;hould be no religious te&s;t whatever in government. Our Saviour &s;aid "My kingdom is not of this world." Tho&s;e who demand an acknowledgment, that the New Te&s;tament was written by divine in&s;piration, before an admi&s;&s;ion to the offices of a commonwealth, &s;ay that his kingdom is of this world. They &s;peak a language different from his. In this point they are not Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>I conceive it to be our duty as followers of Chri&s;t to extend our toleration to the Jews, without con&s;idering if it would, or would not tend, to the temporal advantage of the commonwealth in which we live. There cannot be a doubt, however, I &s;hould think with a rea&s;onable man, but that it would tend to the pre&s;ent and imme|diate intere&s;ts of a &s;tate. We are told by the apo&s;tles that the whole Jewi&s;h nation is to be converted to Chri&s;tianity, that "all I&s;rael &s;hall be &s;aved." I conceive that the drawing a political line of di&s;tinction between us and them has a tendency to prevent their conver&s;ion, that the unlimited toleration of them has a tendency to bring them over to the go&s;pel, and therefore that the unlimited toleration of them is the cau&s;e of God.</P>
<P>In our conduct towards the Jews we &s;hould imitate St. Paul who &s;ays "unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews." He never in&s;ulted them in the manner that &s;ome who call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians in&s;ult them. One would &s;uppo&s;e that the wan|ton abu&s;e of them for their religious principles, would irritate their minds, would inflame them to a de&s;ire of revenge, and have a ten|dency to confirm them in their unbelief. They might from this entertain a di&s;gu&s;t to the principles and the truth of the go&s;pel, from the folly and wickedne&s;s of tho&s;e who call them&s;elves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> friends. St. Paul addre&s;&s;es them with the tenderne&s;s of a parent towards his children. He &s;ays "my heart's de&s;ire and prayer to God for I&s;rael is, that they might be &s;aved." Our Saviour's mi&s;|&s;ion was at fir&s;t intended only for the Jews. "I am not &s;ent but unto the lo&s;t &s;heep of the hou&s;e of I&s;rael." He laments with an affectionate and plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ibility the invincible obduracy of the Jews. "O Jeru&s;alem, Jeru&s;alem, which kille&s;t the prophets, and &s;tone&s;t them which are &s;ent unto thee: how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings, and ye would not! behold your hou&s;e is left unto you de&s;olate."&mdash;He &s;hed tears over Jeru&s;alem, when he reflected up|on her coming de&s;truction. And when he was extended by the Jews upon the cro&s;s, with a patience that triumphed over &s;corn and over torture, he mildly &s;ays, (O admirable meekne&s;s! O godlike benevolence!) "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do." Tho&s;e who wi&s;h to be the true di&s;ciples of our Saviour and of his apo&s;tles &s;hould endeavour to imitate them in this as in other matters. If it &s;hould be ob&s;erved the prophets mention that the Jews were to be "&s;cattered among all people" and were to be|come "a cur&s;e, and an a&s;toni&s;hment, and a hi&s;&s;ing, and a re|proach." I will an&s;wer that the&s;e prophecies refer to the time of
<PB N="17" REF="025356_0020_0FCD0374427205B8">the apo&s;tacy, from which dark and gloomy night, the glorious go&s;pel of our Saviour is going to emerge as brilliant as the day|&s;tar.</P>
<P>The French have not led the Jews away captive. They &s;hould not wi&s;h them to &s;it down and weep by the waters of France, and to hang their harps upon the willows which grow therein.</P>
<P>The French nation will immediately reap an advantage from the naturalization of the Jews, from giving them the &s;ame political pri|vileges with others, in an increa&s;e of &s;ubjects attached to the new go|vernment which &s;ecures them the&s;e privileges. It is a childi&s;h ab|&s;urdity to &s;uppo&s;e, that where the Jews are naturalized, they will overrun, and be mi&s;chievous to, the country which naturalizes them. The learned Abb&eacute; Gregoire, who is in many re&s;pects an amiable man, and a friend to humanity, though he profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf to be a Catholic, in his late curious E&s;&s;ay<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is entitled (according to the Engli&s;h tran&s;lation) "An E&s;&s;ay on the Phy&s;ical Moral, and Political Reformation of the Jews.

If they were all to emigrate to France, and probably &s;he will never &s;ee a fifth part of them at a time, what could they do, if they had ho&s;|tile intentions, again&s;t twenty five millions of people? It is the part, however, of men who are per&s;ecuted, and not of men who are re&s;tored to equal rights with others, to bear ho&s;tile intentions. It is by ju&s;tice, and humanity, and not by per&s;ecution, that a go|vernment &s;ecures it&s;elf. To do good to tho&s;e who are governed, &s;hould be the object of every government, and it &s;hould be to the people what the poet &s;ays the river Nile is to Egypt,

<P>Mr. Burke &s;ays of the Engli&s;h Nation, "They do not con&s;ider their church e&s;tabli&s;hment as convenient but as e&s;&s;ential to their &s;tate; not as a thing heterogeneous and &s;eparable; &s;omething added for accommodation; what they may either keep up or lay a&s;ide, accor|ding to their temporary ideas of convenience. They con&s;ider it as the foundation of their whole con&s;titution, with which, and with every part of which, it holds an indi&s;&s;oluble union. Church and &s;tate are ideas in&s;eparable in their minds, and &s;carcely is the one ever mentioned without mentioning the other." For my part I cannot &s;ee that the church e&s;tabli&s;hment is e&s;&s;entia to the &s;tate. Other &s;tates have thriven without &s;uch a religious e&s;tabli&s;hment, and therefore it is not nece&s;&s;ary to England. That the Engli&s;h con&s;ti|tution merits high admiration, I &s;hall endeavour to prove in the fol|lowing pages. I mean to defend the great outlines of it, an here|ditary monarch, with an hereditary nobility, and with an hou&s;e of commons freely elected from the people, as a government &s;uited to
<PB N="18" REF="025356_0021_0FCD0375B9523990">the genius of the people of England. Cicero &s;ays, "Statuo e&s;&s;e op|time con&s;titutam rempublicam, quae ex tribus generibus illi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, re|gali, optimo, &amp; populari modice confu&s;a." I do not know whether this be true, yet I think where there is a monarchy, the Engli&s;h con|&s;titution is an excellent plan of government. I cannot perceive, how|ever, how the exclu&s;ive e&s;tabli&s;hment of the church of England is nece&s;&s;ary to the Engli&s;h con&s;titution. If we examine the liturgy of the church of England, we &s;hall find that it has a con&s;iderable re|&s;emblance to that of the church of Rome. Both liturgies have the creed of St. Athana&s;ius. It is a&s;&s;erted, to the di&s;grace of human na|ture, at the conclu&s;ion of this creed, as it is printed in the Roman Catholic liturgy, "This is the Catholic faith, which except a man believe faithfully and &s;tedfa&s;tly he cannot be &s;aved." And the liturgy of the church of England adopts it, but omits (in the way to re|formation) the word &s;tedfa&s;tly. "This is the Catholic faith, which except a man believe faithfully, he cannot be &s;aved." The doctrine of the Trinity, as maintained in this creed, has not any foundation in &s;cripture, and is an affront to rea&s;on. It is the opinion of the great Sir I&s;aac Newton, in his letters to Le Clerc, that the maintain|ing it as a point nece&s;&s;ary to be believed, has con&s;iderably impeded the progre&s;s of Chri&s;tianity. Calling the &s;on of God, Almighty, and praying to him as if he were the Almighty, is erroneous. It is &s;aid in &s;cripture "I am the Lord thy God&mdash;thou &s;halt have none other Gods but me." Exodus, 20. 2, 3. "Hear, O I&s;rael, the Lord our God is one Lord." Deut. 6.4. "Lord God of I&s;rael, there is no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath." 1 Kings, 8.23. "To whom then will ye liken me, or &s;hall I be equal? &s;aith the holy one." I&s;aiah 40.25. "I am the Lord, and there is none el&s;e, there is no God be&s;ides me: that they may know, from the ri&s;ing of the &s;un, and from the we&s;t, that there is none be&s;ides me: I am the Lord and there is none el&s;e." I&s;a. 45.5, 6. "Thus &s;aith the Lord thy redeemer, the holy one of I&s;rael." I&s;a. 48.17. And I conceive, as has been a&s;&s;erted by the learned Dr. Clarke, that, in the &s;ixth ver&s;e of the ninth chapter of this pro|phet, the words relating to Chri&s;t "everla&s;ting father" &s;hould be tran&s;lated "Father of the age to come." Vide "Clarke on the Attributes." Page 403. See al&s;o an admirable demon&s;tration in this book that there could not originally be two omnipotent being. "And the Lord &s;hall be king over all the earth. In that day there &s;hall be one Lord, and his name one." Zechariah, 14.9. Thus much we read in the Old Te&s;tament. In the the New Te&s;tament we read that our Saviour prayed to the deity, which manife&s;tly &s;hows that he was inferior to and dependent upon him. He could not have given us an example of piety, if he had not been dependent upon God. He is jealous of their putting him upon the &s;ame rank with God. He expre&s;sly forbids it. He expre&s;sly mentions his in|feriority. "Why calle&s;t thou me good? There is none good, &s;ave one, that is God." Luke 18.19. "For my father is greater than I." John 14.28. This, however, is evaded by &s;aying that reference is here made to the human, and not to the cele&s;tial nature of our Saviour. St. Paul, however, &s;ays of the Almighty "For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he &s;aith all things are put under him, it is manife&s;t that he is excepted which did put all things under him. And when all things &s;hall be &s;ubdued unto him,
<PB N="19" REF="025356_0022_0FCD03774DD8A5B0">then &s;hall the Son al&s;o him&s;elf be &s;ubject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all." 1 Corinth. 15. 27, 28. The inferiority of our Saviour to his cele&s;tial nature is here clearly and unequivocally determined. He is not excepted from all which is put in &s;ubjection to God him&s;elf, at the con&s;ummation of all things. St. Paul &s;ays "There is none other God but one. For though there be that are called Gods, whether in Heaven or in Earth (as there be Gods many, and Lords many); but to us there is but one God, the father <HI>of</HI> whom are all things <GAP DESC="foreign"> and we in him: and one Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>by</HI> whom are all things <GAP DESC="foreign"> and we by him." 1 Corinth. 8. 4, 5, 6. And St. Paul &s;ays of our Saviour, "Who is the image of the invi&s;ible God, <HI>the fir&s;t born of every creature.</HI>". Colo&s;s. 1.15. Nor do I conceive that the pa&s;&s;age in the Epi&s;tle to the Phillippians is contradictory to what the apo&s;tle &s;ays in other places. "Chri&s;t Je|&s;us, who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: but made him&s;elf of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a &s;ervant, and was made in the likene&s;s of Men. Wherefore God al&s;o hath highly exalted him."

I think it will appear from the context (which it is always right to con&s;ider in our comments upon a pa&s;&s;age in any author) the apo&s;tle did not mean to &s;ay that Chri&s;t was equal to God, in the &s;trict &s;en&s;e of the word, that is, not in any point inferior, for he immediately afterwards &s;ays, "Wherefore God hath highly exalted him."

<P>Some have thought that the fir&s;t part of the go&s;pel of St. John is a plain and direct refutation of all this &s;y&s;tem of rea&s;oning.&mdash;"In the beginning" has not &s;o unlimited a &s;en&s;e as &s;ome &s;hould make us believe. We are told in the fir&s;t part of Gene&s;is that this world was made, "in the beginning." It mu&s;t have been created, however, a va&s;t length of time after the exi&s;tence of the Almighty him&s;elf. "The word" by St. John is certainly called "God." But &s;till our Saviour in my opinion is God of God, and not God of him&s;elf, <GAP DESC="foreign"> and not <GAP DESC="foreign">, according to the old learned phra&s;e. He is &s;aid in this very fir&s;t chapter of St. John to be "begotten of the father," which ju&s;tifies my opinion. What is begotten cannot be originally &s;elf-exi&s;tent.</P>
<P>We &s;hould be cautions, while we do not exalt our Saviour to a rank which is too high, that we do not improperly degrade him. He is not equal to the Almighty, but he is more than a man, and a pro|phet. It is &s;aid of our Saviour in the above mentioned chapter of St. John that "the world was made by him." The conception of Mary, was certainly miraculous. We are told in the fir&s;t chapter of St. Luke. "Then &s;aid Mary unto the angel, how &s;hall this be, &s;eeing I know not a man? And the angel an&s;wered and &s;aid unto her, the Holy Gho&s;t &s;hall come upon thee, and the power of the highe&s;t &s;hall over&s;hadow thee: therefore al&s;o that holy thing which

The pa&s;&s;ages in the New Te&s;tament, which &s;peak of the &s;uperiority of our Saviour to common humanity, are &s;o nu|merous, that it would be truly awful to get rid of them as interpo|lations. This, however, would not an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of tho&s;e who degrade the illu&s;trious Son and Mini&s;ter of God. They mu&s;t al&s;o get rid of &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in the ancient Prophets. The follow|ing pa&s;&s;age in I&s;aiah, which is acknowledged by all the Jews to be genuine, though they interpret it differently from us, and which can|not with any rea&s;on be &s;u&s;pected for an interpolation, is directly again&s;t tho&s;e who would level our Saviour to the rank of a mere man.

<P>Calling al&s;o the Holy Gho&s;t, Almighty, and praying to it, as to the Almighty, is erroneous.

(<GAP DESC="foreign"> &s;piritus &s;anc|tus, <GAP DESC="foreign"> ventus, from <GAP DESC="foreign"> &s;piro.) To call the &s;pirit of God, God him&s;elf, to pray to the &s;pirit of a being, in&s;tead of, and in derogation to, the being who bears that &s;pirit, mu&s;t be im|proper. In the liturgy of the church of Rome, in "the lita|ny of our lady of Loretto" we read "God the Father of Heaven, have mercy on us.

In the litany which is in the liturgy of the church of England, we read "O God the Father of Heaven, have mercy upon us mi&s;erable &s;inners.

The doctrine of the Trinity has been borrowed, with other doctrines, from the church of Rome, by the church of England. The church of England al&s;o, in imitation of the church of Rome, inculcates that her prie&s;ts have the pow|er of ab&s;olution. In the "vi&s;itation of the &s;ick" in the liturgy of the church of England we read "Our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who hath left power to his church to ab&s;olve all &s;inners, who truly re|pent and believe in him, of his great mercy forgive thee thine of|fences; and by his authority committed to me, I ab&s;olve thee from all thy &s;ins, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t." In &s;hort, we have, according to an expre&s;&s;i|on of the late celebrated Earl of Chatham, "a Popi&s;h liturgy." If we examine the hi&s;tory of England al&s;o before the glorious re|volution under William the third, we &s;hall find that the church of England followed the church of Rome in the path of per&s;ecution.

It was at the revolution in 1688, when the di&s;&s;enters were allowed to attend their &s;everal meeting|hou&s;es without the penalties of the law, and when the toleration of religious opinions was con&s;iderably enlarged. King William (who&s;e memory de&s;erves the highe&s;t affection and regard) wi&s;hed, but could not obtain, a liberal toleration. When he came to the crown of England, he earne&s;tly recommended the cau&s;e of the di&s;&s;enters to the parliament and &s;aid, "while he doubted not they would &s;uf|ficiently provide again&s;t Papi&s;ts, he hoped they would leave room for the admi&s;&s;ion of all Prote&s;tants that were willing and able to &s;erve." He added, "this conjunction in my &s;ervice will tend to the better uniting you among&s;t your&s;elves, and the &s;trengthening you again&s;t your common adver&s;aries."

<P>Mr. Burke in his indignation, again&s;t the prevailing dei&s;m in France, &s;hould have reflected that this has been greatly occa&s;ioned
<PB N="22" REF="025356_0025_0FCD037C74944BF0">by the ab&s;urd and pernicious doctrines of the Roman Catholics. Burnet &s;ays, in his life of Lord Roche&s;ter, that this libertine no|bleman, who converted to Chri&s;tianity by con&s;idering the 53d. chapter of I&s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">an, confe&s;&s;ed that his &s;ceptical notions had been con|&s;iderably produced by &s;eeing the clergy of England. There are other dei&s;ts who might &s;ay the &s;ame thing with Lord Roche&s;ter. If we con&s;ider the bi&s;hops in England, we &s;hall &s;ometimes find that in&s;tead of re&s;embling the meek, virtuous, and humble apo&s;tles of our Lord, they are proud, ambitious, hard-hearted, and bear a greater re&s;emblance to Dives who "was clothed in <HI>purple</HI> and <HI>fine linen,</HI> and fared &s;umptou&s;ly every day." If the clergy in England could thus make men dei&s;ts, what mu&s;t have been done by the clergy in France? It was a &s;aying of the celebrated Dr. Ogden of Cambridge to a wo|man who was admiring the young clergy "Ah! madam, if you had been at the &s;hop where the ware is made, you would have le&s;s re&s;pect for it." I have been at this &s;hop (the Univer&s;ity of Cam|bridge) and think the doctor's ob&s;ervation contains much truth; for a &s;et of more debauched, profligate, and dei&s;tical men, than the young clergy there, are with difficulty to be met with. I &s;peak generally, for &s;ome of the clergy of the church of England have been men of great virtues, as well as eminent talents and learning. The names of Clarke, Tillot&s;on, Hoadly, Burnet, Barrow,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The famous Lord Bolingbroke u&s;ed to &s;ay that, if any man could make him believe in Chri&s;tianity, it would be Barrow.&mdash;He was profe&s;&s;or of mathematica in the univer&s;ity of Cambridge immediately before Sir I&s;aac Newton.

<P>It is highly to be lamented that the Engli&s;h will not admit of a general toleration. The late Lord Chatham, who was the be&s;t &s;tate&s;man, perhaps, that the coontry ever knew, though it has pro|du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d many of great ability, &s;ays in a letter to Dr. Price.

Happy, if the times had allowed us to add hopes to our wi&s;hes!" How imperfect in this re&s;pect is the character of the pre|&s;ent mini&s;ter, Mr. Pitt, to that of his enlightened and virtuous fa|ther! The pre&s;ent mini&s;ter has always oppo&s;ed the admi&s;&s;ion of di&s;&s;enters to the offices of government, and contended, with a &s;pi|rit of per&s;ecution &s;imilar to that of Popery, that none have a right to them but who are of the church of England. In this he has ap|peared as unju&s;t as he was great and commendable in his very judi|cious contention for the abolition of the &s;lave trade and for a refor|mation in parliament. From this latter &s;cheme, however, he has unhappily for him&s;elf and for his country apo&s;tatized. His cele|brated rival Mr. Fox, with equal talents, has contended for the abo|lition of the &s;lave trade, and now contends for the reformation of parliament, and for toleration of the di&s;&s;enters. If a dereliction of his irregularities in private life which has been begun &s;hould be car|ried

It was lamentable to &s;ee a man, who was frequently exerting gigantic talents to &s;ave the &s;tate, as ill-attended almo&s;t in private life as Cataline who wi&s;hed to over|throw it.

<P>I WILL con&s;ider whether the con&s;titution of England, with ju&s;t amendments, would have been a proper model of government for France at this time. I am decidedly of opinion that it would.</P>
<P>I will fir&s;t con&s;ider whether it would have been wi&s;e in the peo|ple of France, at this time to pre&s;erve their monarchy; and after that, whether it would have been wi&s;e to pre&s;erve their nobility, and to form their new government upon the great outlines of the En|gli&s;h con&s;titution.</P>
<P>It has been urged by the writers again&s;t monarchy, that it is a &s;y&s;tem of government reprobated in &s;cripture. I call it a &s;y&s;tem of government, in conformity to the opinion and expre&s;&s;ion of all learn|ed writers on government, notwith&s;tanding an ab&s;urd expre&s;&s;ion u&s;ed by Mr. Paine, that it is a nullity of &s;y&s;tem. It is a word formed from the compo&s;ition of two Greek words <GAP DESC="foreign"> and <GAP DESC="foreign"> and &s;ignifies a government, or rather the executive part of it, in the hands of one man. In this latter &s;en&s;e it is u&s;ed by Monte&s;quieu. The monarchy which is reprobated in the fir&s;t book of Samuel, is an ab&s;olute monarchy. Samuel tells the people of I&s;rael that your monarch "will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your olive|yards, even the be&s;t of them, and will give them to his &s;ervants." And again he &s;ays "He will take the tenth of your &s;heep, and ye &s;hall be his &s;ervants." This is in no re&s;pect &s;uch a monarch as the con&s;titution of England de&s;igned the king of that country. The King of England can take no man's field, or his vineyard, or the tenth of his &s;heep, at his plea&s;ure. It is fact, which fell within my own knowledge, that a wealthy and capricious old woman for a con|&s;iderable time refu&s;ed to &s;ell, notwith&s;tanding repeated entreaties, a &s;pot of ground which &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, to the pre&s;ent king, which
<PB N="24" REF="025356_0027_0FCD038387468C80">he wi&s;hed to purcha&s;e at a high price, that he might add it, to his gardens at Richmond. There are in&s;tances of the king of England being &s;ued, as a private per&s;on would be &s;ued, in the Engli&s;h courts of law. Bracton the old lawyer &s;ays that in England "The pow|er of the king is the power of the law." Some of the kings of En|gland have been fond of calling them&s;elves "the great &s;ervant of the commonwealth of England." And though it may be urged, that James the fir&s;t, in particular, who u&s;ed this appellation, was him|&s;elf too fond of arbitrary power; yet it &s;erves to &s;how, that he would &s;ometimes utter a language to plea&s;e tho&s;e who were the rational admirers of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution. To return to the argument relative to monarchy being reprobated in &s;cripture, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve that in the fir&s;t epi&s;tle of Peter it is &s;aid "&s;ubmit your&s;elves to eve|ry ordinance of man for the Lord's &s;ake; whether it be <HI>to the king as &s;upreme;</HI> or unto governors, as unto tho&s;e that are &s;ent by him for the puni&s;hment of evil-doers, and for the prai&s;e of them that do well." Chap. 2. ver. 13, 14. The meaning of which words mu&s;t be, I think every candid and intelligent per&s;on will allow, that we &s;hould not as Chri&s;tians endeavour to over&s;et a government, whether it is monarchical or republican, if that government is rightly ad|mini&s;tered. A little while after in the &s;ame chapter St. Peter &s;ays too "fear God, honour the king."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">St. Paul al&s;o tells us to pray for "Kings, and for all that are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life." 1 Timothy 2.2.</NOTE> How can we honour the king if, according to the notion held out in a vain and &s;illy letter written by Mr. Thomas Paine to the Abb&eacute; Sieyes, we reduce all kings to the &s;tate of private individuals? I therefore am of opinion that the fir&s;t National A&s;&s;embly of France (the con&s;tituent a&s;&s;em|bly as it is frequently called) were wi&s;e in not aboli&s;hing their mo|narchy, and I was happy to find that out of near a thou&s;and mem|bers, only eight were of the &s;ame antimonarchical principles with Mr. Paine.</P>
<P>I will now con&s;ider whether it would have been wi&s;e in the peo|ple of France to pre&s;erve their nobility. I think it was unwi&s;e to aboli&s;h their nobility, as it might inflame the re&s;entment of Eu|ropean Nations, le&s;t &s;uch a &s;pirit of innovation &s;hould reach their dominions, as a nobility well regulated might be of no di&s;advan|tage to the country, and as it might attach the nobility of France to the new e&s;tabli&s;hment of political affairs. In the time of Charles the fir&s;t, the republicans, as they called them&s;elves, aboli&s;hed in England, the monarchy in the family of the Stuarts, and the Hou&s;e of Lords.&mdash;And yet, &s;o &s;trangely incon&s;i&s;tent are mankind, they &s;uffered the Long Parliament to vote them&s;elves perpetual, to continue their &s;eats in the legi&s;lature for ever unrevokable by the people. The advocates for this mea&s;ure contended, that the unin|terrupted attention to bu&s;ine&s;s would better frame men to be legi&s;|lators, than one that was di&s;continued at the caprice of others. They would not allow this argument to avail in favour of one branch of the legi&s;lature, the Hou&s;e of Lords, which they urged in favour of the Hou&s;e of Commons, the whole of the legi&s;lature, and of the government, at that time. The&s;e men, who would not have a monarch from the Hou&s;e of Stuart, &s;et up at la&s;t a monarchy in the Hou&s;e of Cromwell. For names do not &s;ignify much with men
<PB N="25" REF="025356_0028_0FCD0384C642CC68">of under&s;tanding. A man may have the power of a monarch with the name of protector. The re&s;ult of all this was that the people of England grew &s;ick of Long Parliaments which they could not controul, of hypocritical or weak protectors, (for Oliver was the one and Richard Cromwell the other) that they as eagerly de&s;ired their old noble con&s;titution again "as the thir&s;ty hart panteth for the water-brooks." Tho&s;e who have read the Engli&s;h hi&s;tory well know that the nobility and the monarch made a common cau&s;e with the intelligent part of the nation, and at la&s;t re-e&s;tabli&s;hed the ancient form of government. I wi&s;h, however, to be under|&s;tood when &s;peaking of the&s;e proceedings, that I am no advocate for the tyrannical mea&s;ures of the fir&s;t or &s;econd Charles, but for the Engli&s;h Con&s;titution well altered and well admini&s;terd. It may happen in France, as it happened in England, that the di&s;content|ed nobility may league with the di&s;contented monarch, and over|turn that government which was e&s;tabli&s;hed to their di&s;advantage. Whereas, if the people of France had formed a &s;y&s;tem of govern|ment &s;imilar to the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, the monarch would have had no rea&s;on to be di&s;contented, the nobility erected into a &s;epa|rate branch of the legi&s;lature, and made hereditory coun&s;ellors of the kingdom, would have found them&s;elves honoured with a new con&s;equence, have found them&s;elves and their country happier, and would generally have been inclined to &s;upport that new &s;y&s;tem of government. Some per&s;ons have a violent aver&s;ion to nobility which perhaps may not be &s;trictly defen&s;ible. I confe&s;s my&s;elf I &s;ee no occa&s;ion for them in tho&s;e countries where they have not before exi&s;ted. Yet in tho&s;e countries where they already exi&s;t, I would have the privileges of the order well regulated, and and not the order entirely aboli&s;hed. Some of their titles may be ridiculous and improper. But I &s;ee nothing which gives great of|fence in Earl, which is derived from a Saxon word &s;ignifying Elder|man, or in Count, which is derived from the Latin word Comes, and fignifies, according to Bracton and Fleta, the fellow and compa|nion of a king. Some who call them&s;elves republicans di&s;like the name of Earl, but are fond of Excellency, a very flattering title. It may with &s;ome appearance of rea&s;on be urged that taking away the privileges of nobility from a family, which have been gained by the valour, the wi&s;dom, the integrity of their ance&s;tors, is as unju&s;t as taking away the money which they have gained in the &s;ame man|ner. If it &s;hould be ob&s;erved, that titles may do mi&s;chief to man|kind, I will &s;ay the &s;ame of immen&s;e wealth. It may fairly, how|ever, be &s;aid that a nobility under proper regulations, may, in a country where a monarchy has been &s;ome time e&s;tabli&s;hed, be of advantage to that country. There is &s;omething certainly in blood. There is &s;ome pre&s;umption that a valiant and generous father will beget a valiant and generous &s;on. The qualities of the mind will often de&s;cend as well as the features of the face.

<P>It has been &s;aid by the advocates again&s;t nobility, that titles are harmle&s;s or ab&s;urd nick-names. If titles are harmle&s;s, it &s;urely then is not worth the while to hazard a dangerous commotion in a &s;tate to procure their abolition. Nobility, however, upon the &s;y&s;tem of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, may not only be harmle&s;s, it may be advantageous to a monarchy. It may be given as the reward of patrioti&s;m and valour, and may excite to tho&s;e noble virtues. An hereditary Hou&s;e of Lords al&s;o, upon the plan of the Engli&s;h con|&s;titution, might tend to benefit the &s;tate, by maintaining a proper
<PB N="27" REF="025356_0030_0FCCDBC8D18A3FE8">balance, between the power of the crown, and the rights of the people. In England, if the con&s;titution were properly admini&s;tered, this hereditary Hou&s;e of Lords could never render any material in|jury to the intere&s;ts of the people, as they could pa&s;s no act with|out the concurrence of the repre&s;entatives of the people in the Hou&s;e of Commons. The government, therefore, thus balanced, has, ac|cording to the ob&s;ervations of learned and able politicians, the ex|ecution of the monarchy, the wi&s;dom of the ari&s;to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">racy, and the popular virtues of the democracy. The privileges of the peerage (excepting its being hereditary) are not very great. Mr. De Lolme, in his admirable E&s;&s;ay on the Con&s;titution of England &s;ays, "In ca&s;e of a public offence, or even a &s;imple breach of the peace, a poet may be committed till he finds bail by any ju&s;tice of the peace: and peers are to be tried by the common cour&s;e of the law, for all offences under felony. With regard to civil matters, they are at all times free from arre&s;ts; but execution may be had again&s;t their effects in the &s;ame manner as again&s;t tho&s;e of other &s;ubjects." Chap. 18.

I have no objection to any proper abridgement of the privileges of the nobility in England or in France, but I think there &s;hould be a nobility as well as a monarch at this time in France. Where there is a monarch there &s;hould of cour&s;e be nobles. It &s;eems natural to expect &s;uch a gradation in a &s;tate. It is rea&s;onable to wi&s;h it, ac|cording to the opinion of the able&s;t politicians, of Monte&s;quieu e&s;|pecially, who &s;ays that in a monarchy "The mo&s;t natural, inter|mediate, and &s;ubordinate power is that of the nobility. This in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;eems e&s;&s;ential to a monarchy, who&s;e fundamental maxim is, <HI>no monarchy, no nobility; no nobility, no monarchy.</HI>" Spi|rit of Laws, Vol. 1. page 22.</P>
<P>If the con&s;tituent a&s;&s;embly of France had not made a decree for the abolition of nobility, the late revolution in that country would have found many more advocates in Germany and Spain, where the nobles are particularly fond of their high de&s;cent. It would have been politic to have attended to the&s;e prejudices, if they are to be called &s;uch. An attention to them would have made the principles of the revolution &s;pread more ea&s;ily in Germany, Spain, and other countries of Europe, and would have made it more &s;ecure at home.
<PB N="28" REF="025356_0031_0FCD038DB5D56710">I could wi&s;h the nobility, as well as the monarchy, under proper limitations, to be re&s;tored in France, and the bloody and cruel lu&s;t for &s;ummary executions which has &s;hown it&s;elf in that country to be utterly aboli&s;hed. In the&s;e points I agree with the celebrated Mr. Necker, whom I hold in many re&s;pects to be a good man, and an able politician, I do not know that I can &s;ay I altogether co|incide with him, but I do con&s;iderably. If the&s;e things are not attended to, the new rai&s;ed government may be like the hou&s;e of Job, which, as we read in &s;cripture, was &s;mitten in its four corners, and levelled by a mighty wind from the wilderne&s;s. The French may in vain boa&s;t of the millions which they can bring into the field in &s;upport of the revolution, for &s;ome of tho&s;e millions may prove like the elephants in ancient battles, which would &s;ometimes turn upon tho&s;e who led them on. The accu&s;tomed prejudices of the French are not ea&s;ily eradicated; and in &s;ome future time, if they are not well managed, they may cur&s;e the National A&s;&s;embly, and tear the air with the &s;ound of Vive le Roy. I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, how|ever, that I am a friend to the revolution in many re&s;pects, but I wi&s;h it &s;ecured by every prudent mea&s;ure. I admire above mea&s;ure the demolition of the Ba&s;tille.</P>
<P>I admire al&s;o the abolition of lettres de cachet, of arbitrary impo&s;ts, of the game-laws, of tithes, of religious hou&s;es, and of the power of that heretic the Pope. In &s;hort, I will ob&s;erve, that there are many things which I admire, and many things which I di&s;approve in the conduct of the French Revolutioni&s;ts. I am neither led by Mr. Burke nor by Mr. Paine. I would wi&s;h to make neither of the&s;e men my Mo&s;es, from whom I am to receive the law, and who&s;e &s;entiments I am to adopt.&mdash;This, however, I think is fairly to be &s;aid in favour of the new French Government, that if it has errors, the people who are now free, may alter tho&s;e er|rors at a future and convenient time. They may alter their go|vernment, by a&s;&s;imilating it to the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, in appoint|ing an hereditary Hou&s;e of Lords, and in the re&s;toration of the con&s;titution of 1789.&mdash;It has been &s;aid that the que&s;tion, whether the con&s;titution of England, with ju&s;t amendments, would be a proper model of government for France at this time, is no que&s;ti|on at all that it will not admit of a doubt, that all mankind will agree in their opinion about it. In an&s;wer to which I will ob&s;erve, that the National A&s;&s;embly determined that they would not adopt the Engli&s;h con&s;titution with or without amendments as a model of government for the people of France. The matter, therefore, has been a que&s;tion with them, it has admitted of a doubt.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid that the Engli&s;h have no con&s;titution, and that they &s;hould call a convention of the people to make one.&mdash;There is to be &s;ure no con&s;titution in England written, like the con&s;titu|tions of the States of America. Cu&s;tom, however, has e&s;tabli&s;h|ed a regular method of political proceeding in England, which is as binding as any written con&s;titution whatever. The common law of England is founded in this manner upon cu&s;tom, and is not written down. It is called the lex non &s;cripta, the unwritten law; and the &s;tatute law, the lex &s;cripta, the written law.&mdash;Yet no man will &s;ay that the unwritten law, founded on cu&s;tom, is not as prevail|ing as the written law.&mdash;The con&s;titution of England, however, does not, like the common law, merely depend upon cu&s;tom, but is
<PB N="29" REF="025356_0032_0FCD038F456BD140">corroborated by the written law. There are various &s;tatutes which explain what the con&s;titution is, which de&s;cribe its limits. There is a Bill of Rights, which I cannot agree with Mr. Paine to be a Bill of Wrongs.&mdash;</P>
<P>If it &s;hould be ob&s;erved of the French nobility, that they do not merit, from their own virtue or the virtue of their ance&s;tors, to be erected into a &s;eparate and hereditary branch of the legi&s;la|ture; I will an&s;wer, if we con&s;ult the Hi&s;tory of France, we &s;hall find that the nobility of France have &s;ometimes &s;hown them&s;elves to be true friends to their country and to the intere&s;ts of man|kind, though they have &s;ometimes acted in an oppo&s;ite charac|ter. In the conte&s;ts between Catholics and the Hugonots the no|bility have taken different &s;ides. We find, however, the name of Rochefaucault and &s;ome other French noble names, frequently on the &s;ide of virtue and glory. There is an hereditary valour and integrity in &s;ome of their illu&s;trious families. Henry the IV. of France u&s;ed to &s;ay, "I have greatly prevailed again&s;t my enemies "by the &s;word of my brave and generous nobility."&mdash;Many of the French nobility have al&s;o very powerfully contributed in the pre&s;ent day to the freedom of their country. I am an advocate, if an hereditary Hou&s;e of Lords &s;hould be erected, that only tho&s;e peers &s;hould be admitted who would abjure the ancient tyranny, and en|gage to &s;upport the new &s;y&s;tem of freedom.</P>
<P>There would have been a fine opportunity of adopting at this time in France the Engli&s;h con&s;titution without its defects. They might have had no bi&s;hops in their Hou&s;e of Peers, no rotten bo|roughs (through which, in England, one man alone will elect two members of parliament, while ten thou&s;and or more electors, as in We&s;tmin&s;ter, can &s;end but the &s;ame number to parliament) they might have had in every re&s;pect a pure repre&s;entation of the people; they might have had annual parliaments, as was formerly the ca&s;e in England, or at lea&s;t biennial, with an univer&s;al toleration to all religious &s;ects. If the new government had been thus framed, which is con&s;iderably according to the plan of Mr. Mounier, it is &s;aid that many of the emigrant nobility, would have returned with a determination to &s;upport the new con&s;titution.</P>
<P>If the Engli&s;h con&s;titution had been in any manner adopted in France, the Engli&s;h government would have been more inclined to &s;upport the revolution. Some, however, &s;ay that the French revolutioni&s;ts need not fear the re&s;entment nor court the concur|rence of England nor of all Europe. They have numbers &s;ufficient to baffle all opponents. If we were to grant this, yet I would be an advocate, for the adoption of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution in &s;ome mea&s;ure in France. It &s;eems &s;uited to the genius of the country, as they have a monarchy and a nobility. It would tend to the in|ternal quiet and pro&s;perity of the kingdom. It would prevent a&s;|piring and ambitious men from deluging the land with blood in their attempts to po&s;&s;e&s;s the crown. It would cha&s;ti&s;e anarchy, as well as prevent ambition. I will make a quotation from a very able law|yer, Sir William Black&s;tone. He &s;ays, when &s;peaking of the En|gli&s;h government, "Thus every branch of our civil polity &s;upports and is &s;upported, regulates and is regulated by the re&s;t: for the two hou&s;es naturally drawing in two directions of oppo&s;ite intere&s;t, and the prerogative in another &s;till different from them both they
<PB N="30" REF="025356_0033_0FCD039303ED0140">mutually keep each other from exceeding their proper limits; while the whole is prevented from &s;eparation, and artificially connected together by the mixed nature of the crown, which is a part of the legi&s;lative, and the &s;ole executive magi&s;trate. Like three di&s;tinct powers in mechanicks, they jointly impel the machine of govern|ment in a direction different from what either, acting by it&s;elf, would have done; but at the &s;ame time, in a direction partaking of each, and formed out of all; a direction which con&s;titutes the true line of the liberty and happine&s;s of the community." Black|&s;tone's Commentaries, Vol. 1. page 155.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke in many parts of his pamphlets &s;peaks with high ad|miration of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution. He will not recommend, how|ever, the adoption of it in France, le&s;t &s;uch a con&s;titution &s;hould be unfavourable to the power of the Roman Catholic clergy in France. Their intere&s;t &s;eems to be very near his heart. He &s;ays in his &s;e|cond pamphlet (a letter to a member of the National A&s;&s;embly, in an&s;wer to &s;ome objections to his book on French Affairs) "I do not advi&s;e an Hou&s;e of Lords to you." Soon after he &s;ays "I, who&s;e leading principle it is in a reformation of the &s;tate, to make u&s;e of exi&s;ting materials, am of opinion, that the repre&s;entation of the clergy, as a &s;eparate order, was an in&s;titution which touched all the orders more nearly than any of them touched the other; that it was well fitted to connect them, and to hold a place in any wi&s;e monarchical commonwealth." That monarchy and nobility have a connexion with each other I have often heard, but I do not &s;ee that a &s;tate religious e&s;tabli&s;hment has any nece&s;&s;ary connexion with a monarchy. It has been &s;aid that the great number of the French nobility would prevent their being e&s;tabli&s;hed into an here|ditary Hou&s;e of Lords, like the nobility of England. This is a circum&s;tance that might be ea&s;ily remedied. Only tho&s;e who would engage to &s;upport the new government might be admitted to their Hou&s;e of Peers. If there &s;hould be too many of the&s;e, it might be determined by lot, which &s;hould fir&s;t &s;ucceed, and after an extinc|tion of &s;ome titles by death, the others might in the cour&s;e of time &s;ucceed. Or an Hou&s;e of Peers might be made of the princes of the blood, and of the higher order of nobility, who had an hereditary right to &s;eats in the parliaments of France. Tho&s;e who would not abjure or affirm (for a choice in the&s;e points &s;hould be allowed, or religious liberty will be incomplete) again&s;t the &s;upremacy of the Pope, &s;hould not be admitted. Nor would this be unju&s;t. For he who wi&s;hes to make the Pope &s;upreme ruler over his country, wi&s;hes to give the liberty and independence of his country into the hands of a foreign power, and is con&s;equently a traitor and an enemy to that country. Mr. Locke &s;ays "That church can have no right to be tolerated by the magi&s;trate, which is con&s;tituted upon &s;uch a bottom, that all tho&s;e who enter into it, do thereby, ip&s;o facto, de|liver them&s;elves up to the protection and &s;ervice of another prince. For by this means the magi&s;trate would give way to the &s;ettling of a foreign juri&s;diction in his own country, and &s;uffer his own people, to be li&s;ted as it were, for &s;oldiers again&s;t his own government. Nor does the frivolous and fallacious di&s;tinction between the court and the church, afford any remedy to this inconvenience; e&s;pecially when both the one and the other are equally &s;ubject to the ab&s;olute authority of the &s;ame per&s;on; who has not only power to per&s;uade
<PB N="31" REF="025356_0034_0FCD0393C4FC0BF8">the members of his church to what&s;oever he li&s;ts, either as purely religious, or as in order thereunto, but can al&s;o enjoin them on pain of eternal &s;ire." See Locke's Fir&s;t Letter on Toleration, 2d. Vol. quarto, page 374. A &s;alutary re&s;traint, and no other, &s;hould be put upon Roman Catholics, where fears are rationally to be enter|tained of their overturning the government. But where no &s;uch fears can rationally be entertained, then I think they &s;hould be ad|mitted to the &s;ame political privileges with others. Mr. We<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">de|born in his late account of England, which is in &s;everal re&s;pects not injudicious, &s;ays, that there are no more than 16, 000 Roman Catholics in England. If that be the ca&s;e, or if there &s;hould be no more than 160, 000, the penal laws again&s;t them might prudently be relaxed.</P>
<P>If an inva&s;ion of France were to be attempted upon the princi|ples of a manife&s;to which was publi&s;hed &s;ome time ago by the emi|grant princes at Coblentz, to re&s;tore the monarchy to its former uncontrouled de&s;poti&s;m, and the Roman Catholic Church to its ex|clu&s;ive and tyrannical domination, then I think every Frenchman, in the ju&s;t defence of his liberties, &s;hould have the &s;ame gallant &s;pi|rit with my heroic relation, the celebrated John Earl of Crawford, (who, however, was &s;ometimes too fond of war) of whom it is &s;aid in a cla&s;&s;ical elegy on his death,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Elegy was written by a German nobleman, and is prefixed to the Life of Earl Crawford written by Rolt.</NOTE>

<P>The &s;ummary executions which have been practi&s;ed in France are injurious to the cau&s;e of liberty, and humanity, and to the intere&s;ts of the country.

The execution of the wicked and perfidious Launay, the governor of the Ba&s;tille, upon the &s;pot, might have been commendable; but &s;urely, in many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;es, the land has been pol|luted with blood from unnece&s;&s;ary or unju&s;tifiable executions.

<P>The French have made a violent and abrupt overthrow of their government, which has induced &s;everal to wi&s;h the &s;ame method of proceeding in England. The be&s;t way of reforming the Engli&s;h government, is not by the dangerous method of a convention, entire|ly to model the government anew, but by gradual reformations, while adhering to the great outlines of the con&s;titution. It would be wi&s;e, however, to make nece&s;&s;ary alterations in the government as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, to prevent the danger of commotions. The re|moval of the hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion might deluge the land with blood, and afterwards leave matters in a wor&s;e &s;tate. If the pre|&s;ent King, or any of his children after him, &s;hould be removed from the throne, after a civil conte&s;t, the &s;ucce&s;sful general on the &s;ide of the people will probably become a favourite of the people and be rai&s;ed to power. For the cry will be among them, we cannot do without a head: and it will be lucky if in|&s;tead of a limited, they do not vex their country with a de&s;potic monarch. De Lolme in his admirable e&s;&s;ay on the Engli&s;h con&s;ti|tution, &s;peaks &s;en&s;ibly of things in &s;uch a &s;ituation. "The power thus given away is already grown very great, before tho&s;e by whom it was given &s;o much as &s;u&s;pect it; and he him&s;elf who enjoys that power, does not know its full extent; but then, on the fir&s;t op|portunity that offers, he &s;uddenly pierces through the clond which hid the &s;ummit from him, and at once &s;eats him&s;elf upon it. The people on the other hand, no &s;ooner recover fight of him, than they &s;ee their favourite become their ma&s;ter, and di&s;cover the evil only to find that it is pa&s;t remedy." Book II. Chap. II.</P>
<P>The people of England have known one Cromwell, and they will be very cautious how they &s;uffer another to ri&s;e. He was a black|guard, but &s;omething of a hero it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;. He became at la&s;t, however, a tyrant, and his reflexion upon magna carta, was as arrogant and ab&s;urd, as it was indecent. There is &s;omewhat in his character for the kings of England to imitate while they dete&s;t. He made the Engli&s;h name formidable at the courts of tyrants. The inqui&s;ition at Li&s;bon had &s;eized and confined his mini&s;ter. He de|mands redre&s;s from the court of Portugal. The an&s;wer returned is that the inqui&s;ition &s;eized the man, and the king has nothing to do with the inqui&s;ition. Cromwell &s;ays, if that be the ca&s;e, I will not make war upon the king, but upon the inqui&s;ition. The mi|ni&s;ter is immediately relea&s;ed.</P>

The civil wars which have originated from conte&s;ted hereditary claims, are more nume<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">, and have been more dreadful and of longer continuance than tho&s;e which have been occa&s;ioned by elec|tion. All the civil wars in France aro&s;e from the hereditary &s;y&s;|tem, or by the imperfection of the hereditary form, which admits of regencies, or monarchy at nur&s;e. With re&s;pect to England, its Hi&s;tory is full of the &s;ame misfortunes. The conte&s;ts for &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion between the hou&s;es of York and Lanca&s;ter la&s;ted a whole cen|tury; and others of a &s;imilar nature have renewed them&s;elves &s;ince that period. Tho&s;e of 1715 and 1745 were of the &s;ame kind." If we attend to the Hi&s;tory of Rome under the emperors, we &s;hall find that the Roman empire was frequently deluged with blood on ac|count of the conte&s;ted elections to the empire. The greate&s;t mi&s;|chiefs attended the elections of the popes, the deys of Algiers, and of all the elective princes in the world. It would be tedious to mention the various in&s;tances. If we read Davila's Hi&s;tory of the Civil Wars in France, we &s;hall find that "the hereditary &s;y&s;tem, or the imperfection of the hereditary form," have had nothing to do with them. The civil war which aro&s;e for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the hou&s;es of York and Lanca&s;ter was to be &s;ure bloody and long. It may yield in&s;truction in pointing out the unhappine&s;s of a di&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ed &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the throne of England. The &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is now indi&s;|putable, upon the true principles of the Engli&s;h Con&s;titution, in the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick. To make it di&s;putable, would hazard &s;uch another bloody contention as that between the hou&s;es of York and Lanca&s;ter. The wars which aro&s;e in 1715 and 1745, were not merely about the hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the throne. The di&s;pute in tho&s;e years was con&s;iderably upon the point whether po|pery or prote&s;tanti&s;m &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed in Great Britain. The hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick were not elevated to the throne of Great Bri|tain for being Germans or foreigners; but for being the next in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the prote&s;tant line. Has Mr. Paine never read, or is he willing to forget, that the pre&s;ent king of Great Britain, is de|&s;cended from the daughter of James the Fir&s;t of England?&mdash;Mr. Paine &s;ays, "Poland, though an elective monarchy, has had fewer wars than tho&s;e which are hereditary." This &s;eems not to be the truth. On the contrary, the unhappine&s;s of Poland from her elec|tive monarchy, has become proverbial. The poet &s;ays:

I would recommend his attention to the mo&s;t approved hi&s;torians and writers on politics, and above all to that excellent book, the Bible, which I am afraid he has never much con&s;idered, or he would never have &s;aid that all kings are reprobated in &s;cripture.</P>
<P>Mr. Paine &s;ays (&s;peaking of hereditary monarchy) "that the mental characters of &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in all countries, are below the ave|rage of human under&s;tanding; that one is a tyrant, another an idiot, a third in&s;ane, and &s;ome all three together; it is impo&s;&s;ible to attach confidence to it, when rea&s;on in man has power to act." The Engli&s;h con&s;titution &s;uffers no tyrant, idiot, or madman, upon the throne. The law incapacitates all of them from the regal power.</P>
<P>Mr. Paine in his &s;econd pamphlet &s;peaks of "the wretched &s;y&s;|tem of a hou&s;e of peers in England." There are certainly many improvements wanting to the &s;y&s;tem of a hou&s;e of peers in England, yet I think the &s;y&s;tem it&s;elf &s;hould not be utterly aboli&s;hed. Some have been fond of putting popery and nobility together; in which there is no connexion. Nor is there a connexion between no|bility and tyranny.

Some, however, I will allow to be remarkable for their vices. The expre&s;&s;ion of Mr. Burke relative to nobility, that it is "the Corinthian pillar of poli&s;hed &s;ociety" is not in my idea liable to ju&s;t ridicule.

<P>The Engli&s;h con&s;titution with three different branches of govern|ment &s;eems &s;uited to the genius of the Engli&s;h and French nation. I am not &s;uch a bigot to it, however, as to &s;uppo&s;e that no form of government can be good which does not re&s;emble it. A republi|can form of government is be&s;t &s;uited to the genius of the Americans. It would be unwi&s;e to attempt the introduction of a nobility into the United States. It might be productive of the wor&s;t con&s;equen|ces. They have never had a nobility, and therefore no injury ac|cures to the de&s;cendants of nobility, in e&s;tabli&s;hing a government without them. The republican form may be be&s;t &s;uited to the Cantons of Switzerland, and other countries. In &s;hort, where a monarchical or a republican form of government has been &s;ome time e&s;tabli&s;hed, it appears wrong to introduce a change, from a mo|narchy to a republic, or from a republic to a monarchy.</P>
<P>It would not be unwi&s;e, perhaps, in the Engli&s;h government to form a hou&s;e of peers, mingled with the Scotch and Iri&s;h nobility, and a hou&s;e of commons freely and equally elected from the three kingdoms. If this &s;y&s;tem of con&s;olidation &s;hould be inconvenient to Ireland on account of its &s;eparation by &s;ea (which inconvenience has been thought too much of by many) it might happily be ef|fected in regard to Scotland. The treatment of Scotland is cer|tainly what cannot be defended. Why, in the name of common ju&s;tice, and of common &s;en&s;e, is not Scotland, proportionably as well repre&s;ented as England? Scotland &s;ends to parliament 45 mem|bers and England above 500. Is England &s;o much &s;uperior, that &s;he merits more than ten times as numerous a repre&s;entation? The peers of Scotland have not lo&s;t their right to be hereditary coun|&s;ellors of the kingdom. Scotland made a treaty with England as an
<PB N="36" REF="025356_0039_0FCD03A196190350">independent nation. It was never conquered. It could not, per|haps, from the daring temper of its inhabitants be ever conquered. The poet beautifully, and with &s;ome truth, calls it

<P>If all the Scotch peers, in&s;tead of &s;ixteen, were to &s;it in the Bri|ti&s;h hou&s;e of peers, there would be a greater chance, though &s;ome of them may now act upon independent principles, of their being generally le&s;s influenced by the mini&s;ter. In 1707, when the 22d article of the treaty of union came to be debated in relation to the number of repre&s;entatives to be &s;ent from Scotland to the parliament <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Great-Britain, the duke of Athole gave in this prote&s;t. "For|a&s;much as the peers of this realm, who are hereditary members of her maje&s;ty's great coun&s;el and parliament, do hereby become elec|tive, and &s;o her maje&s;ty is deprived of her born coun&s;ellors and the peers of their birth right; and whereas at pre&s;ent they are one hun|dred and &s;ixty in number, they are by this article reduced to &s;ix|teen, which &s;ixteen are to be joined to the Hou&s;e of Lords in En|gland, who&s;e number at pre&s;ent con&s;i&s;ts of above one hundred and eighty, whereby <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> is plain that the Scots peers &s;hare in the legi&s;|lative and judicative powers in the Briti&s;h parliament, is very un|equal to that of the Engli&s;h, though the one be repre&s;entative of as free and independent a nation as the other, and is therefore a plain fourfaulture of the peerage of this kingdom, contrary to the honour of the monarchy, di&s;graceful to the kingdom, and prejudicial to the barons and burroughs of this realm." If all the Scotch peers were to be allowed a &s;eat in the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Peers, and the repre|&s;entatives from Scotland to the Hou&s;e of Commons more numerous "it would infu&s;e" (according to an admired expre&s;&s;ion of the late Lord Chatham) "a new portion of vigour into the con&s;titution." It is &s;aid that in the multitude of coun&s;ellors is &s;afety. In the mul|titude of repre&s;entatives there is not only a greater chance of talents but of public virtue. It is obvious to common &s;en&s;e that it is ea|&s;ier to corrupt a few than a great many. In &s;hort, the union be|tween England and Scotland &s;hould be upon a ju&s;t and liberal plan of con&s;olidation, without any partial, but with fair advantages to both parties. It is this which &s;hould be&s;t &s;ecure, what every good man mu&s;t wi&s;h, the uninterrupted union and concord between the two nations, which tends to their mutual glory. It was well &s;aid of England and Scotland by the celebrated Lord Lyttleton, "whom God hath joined together let no man put a&s;under."</P>

Tho&s;e who wi&s;h for the independence of Ireland upon England, that the cau&s;e of liberty may be advanced, are mi&s;taken. If Ireland were at pre&s;ent inde|pendent of England, the cau&s;e of liberty would be materially inju|red. Some &s;ay there are eight or nine Roman catholics to one pro|te&s;tant in Ireland. The prevailing opinion is that the Roman ca|tholics to the prote&s;tants are as three to one. If therefore Ireland were made independent of England, the Roman catholics would have the a&s;cendancy, the prote&s;tants would be obliged to fly the country, or another ma&s;&s;acre might be made of them &s;uch as hap|pened in the time of Charles the Fir&s;t. Some prote&s;tants have con|ceived that the &s;pirit of the Roman catholics is at pre&s;ent &s;o mild as not to give much occa&s;ion for dread. If they were but for a &s;hort time under the mild dominion of &s;ome of the Roman catholics in Ireland, they would find &s;uch corporal exerci&s;e as they would with reluctance try again. They have &s;ometimes put the prote&s;tants upon hor&s;es with &s;addles full of pricks. It is a notorious fact that in Ireland not long ago a prote&s;tant &s;chool-ma&s;ter was &s;eized by the Roman catholics, who cut out his tongue, and cut off both his hands. Government very properly allowed him, though di&s;abled from attending to the &s;chool, the &s;alary which he formerly enjoyed. In a Dublin paper of October 11th, 1791, it is &s;aid, "By a let|ter from Armagh dated on Wedne&s;day la&s;t, we are informed that as yet there is no pro&s;pect of the unhappy animo&s;ities which pre|vail in that quarter being terminated, notwith&s;tanding the various pro&s;ecutions that have taken place at the late a&s;&s;izes. Religious intolerance prevails there with as unrelenting a zeal as ever di&s;graced this country at the commencement of the pre&s;ent century. Why &s;hould they act in a manner di&s;graceful enough to ju&s;tify the reproach, that bigotry had fled from France to take refuge in Ireland?" There are a &s;et of Roman catholics in Ireland called de|fenders, who &s;ay that the whole country belongs to the pope, and who will not &s;uffer, wherever they can exert their blind and un|rea&s;onable fury, a prote&s;tant to live unmole&s;ted. There are per|&s;ons of veracity now living in Ireland who remember when a pro|te&s;tant was roa&s;ted alive by the Roman catholics.

Though it is not rea&s;onable to expel kings from their thrones, without &s;ufficient cau&s;e, yet they &s;hould be re&s;trained from tyranny, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure from extravagance.

The civil con&s;titution of our coun|try is our pride and glory; which we have been taught from our infancy to revere, and which we would die to pre&s;erve." And Dr. Price, &s;ays, that one of the ble&s;&s;ings of England is "that being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the forms of an excellent con&s;titution of go|vernment, any changes or improvements nece&s;&s;ary to correct abu&s;es and to give perfect liberty, may be grafted upon them without tu|mult or danger; whereas, other countries, wanting the&s;e forms, and being under the nece&s;&s;ity of erecting a new con&s;titution on the ruins of an old one, cannot acquire liberty without &s;etting every thing afloat, and making their e&s;cape from &s;lavery through the dangers of anarchy." It has been doubted by &s;ome, whether the wit of man could frame a better government for England than the Engli&s;h con&s;titution. It is certain, however, that the wit of man could contrive a hundred things wor&s;e.</P>
<P>To return again to the affairs of France, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve the proceedings there have been &s;o violent, that they portend &s;ome new revolution to be at hand. The execution of the king was unju&s;t, and highly impolitic. It was expre&s;sly declared by the con&s;titution of 1791 (the only one that, I have con&s;idered, in this pamphlet, as I think it the only form of government yet pub|li&s;hed to the world, which would probably give la&s;ting happine&s;s to the people of France,) that "the per&s;on of the king is &s;acred and inviolable." See Chap. 2. Sect. 1. It was al&s;o declared in the &s;ame &s;ection, "if the king put him&s;elf at the head of an army, and direct the forces of it again&s;t the nation, or if he do not op|po&s;e by a formal act, any &s;uch enterprize, undertaken in his name, he &s;hall be held to have abdicated." If, therefore, the king had done what was laid to his charge by the convention, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ould not, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, if they had adhered to the principles of the con&s;titution, have been put to death, but have only been made to abdicate. Louis the Sixteeth of France was &s;imilar in his cha|racter to James the Second of England. He was led, by Roman catholic prie&s;ts, like James. He &s;hould in the &s;ame manner have been depo&s;ed, but not murdered, and the French crown, in imi|tation of what was done in England, &s;hould have been &s;ettled on the next heir who was le&s;s attached to the court of Rome. The repre&s;entatives of the people of France were not free, at the time of the king's death. They were controuled by the Jacobin So|ciety, and the vote for his execution was probably forced at the
<PB N="40" REF="025356_0043_0FCD03ABC6C82138">point of the bayonet. There is not liberty in that country, where the repre&s;encatives of the people are controuled by any but the people them&s;elves. The Jacobin Society had all the bad points of tyranny in them; they were &s;ecret, cruel, permanent, and not re&s;pon&s;ible. Mr. Necker, before the king's death, publi&s;hed a &s;mall pamphlet, the circulation of which was prevented in France, in which he declared there was a &s;olemn agreement between the convention and the king, to which he was a witne&s;s, that in ca&s;e of the king's acting contrary to the con&s;titution, his per&s;on could not be endangered. Mr. Necker declares that the king would not have accepted the &s;overeignty under the con&s;titution, if this had not been clearly &s;tipulated.</P>
<P>Many of the French are inimical to Mr. Necker, from &s;uppo|&s;ing that he wi&s;hed to introduce a government in France, &s;imilar to the government in Geneva.

How &s;plendid a part would have been a&s;&s;igned to them in the drama of nations, if when occupied in framing a code of laws for a great people, they had concentrated their &s;cattered ideas, and had ranged them&s;elves, &s;o to &s;peak, round the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed political con&s;titution of Europe, with the noble de&s;ign of taking it for their model, and copying &s;uch parts of it as were applicable to France, and of which experience had evinced the utility!

This could be effected, an en|raged democrat might &s;ay, by making the government of England &s;imilar to the republic e&s;tabli&s;hed in France. For the obtaining which end, he would, perhaps, recommend the murder of all the royal family, and of all the nobility. Without the perpetration of this diabolical wickedne&s;s, (which would bring the vengeance of Heaven and of man upon all concerned in it) the erection of a de|mocracy would be as ab&s;urd in England as in France. The peo|ple in both countries have been accu&s;tomed to a king and nobility, and would never re&s;t &s;atisfied with their abolition.

Late political writers, however, of the fir&s;t reputation, think with Cicero, that a con&s;titution &s;imilar to that of England would be be&s;t for all the nations in the world. Machiavel &s;ays of monarchy, ari&s;tocracy, and democracy, "the wi&s;e&s;t legi&s;lators therefore, being aware of the&s;e defects, never e&s;tabli&s;hed any one of them in particular, but con|trived another that partakes of them all, con&s;i&s;ting of a prince, lords, and commons, which they looked upon as more firm and &s;table, becau&s;e every one of the&s;e members would be a check upon the other: and of tho&s;e legi&s;lators, Lycurgus certainly merits the highe&s;t prai&s;e, who con&s;tituted an e&s;tabli&s;hment of this kind at Sparta, which la&s;ted above eight hundred years, to his own great honour as well as the tranquillity of the citizens. Very different was the fate of the government e&s;tabli&s;hed by Solon at Athens, which being a &s;imple democracy only, was of &s;o &s;hort a continuance, that it gave way to the tyranny of Pi&s;i&s;tratus, before the death of the legi&s;lator: and though indeed the heirs of that tyrant were expel|ed about forty years after, and the Athenians not only recovered their liberty, but re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;tabli&s;hed Solon's laws, and plan of govern|ment, yet they did not maintain it above a hundred years, notwith|&s;tanding they made &s;everal new regulations to re&s;train the in&s;olence of the nobles, and the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the commons; the nece&s;&s;ity of which Solon had not fore&s;een: &s;o that for want of tempering his democracy with a due &s;hare of ari&s;tocracy and princely power, it was of &s;hort duration in compari&s;on of the con&s;titution of Sparta."

See Sidney's Di&s;cour&s;es on Government, Vol. 2. page 233. Afterwards he &s;ays, in the &s;ame page, "As for democracy, I believe it can &s;uit only with the convenience of a &s;mall town, accompanied with &s;uch circum&s;tances as are &s;eldom found." I do not know that I can thoroughly accede to the ob&s;er|vations of Machiavel and Sidney, but will repeat, what I have be|fore ob&s;erved, that it is in my opinion impolitic, where a monarchy or a republic has been e&s;tabli&s;hed, to change from one to the other.

<P>He was one of the mo&s;t amiable of mankind. He was de&s;cended of a very illu&s;trious family in France, who were famous for their at|tachment to civil and religious liberty. He was a philo&s;opher of no common ingenuity; humble, humane, ju&s;t, and di&s;intere&s;ted; a friend to &s;cience, liberty, and mankind. He was one of the fir&s;t to &s;tart up in oppo&s;ition to that horrible &s;y&s;tem of de&s;poti&s;m with which his country was oppre&s;&s;ed; and laboured indefatigably in the formation of that excellent con&s;titution which was begun in 1789, and accepted by the king in 1791. This is a con&s;titution from which all the nations of the world may draw &s;alutary princi|ples of government; though, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;, it would have been more complete with a well-regulated Hou&s;e of Lords. In 1792, when he was going to &s;eek a retreat at his e&s;tate in Normandy, a|mong his tenants, to whom he had behaved with a parental affec|tion, he was met by a great body of federates (tho&s;e connected with the Jacobin &s;ociety in Paris) and when making no re&s;i&s;tance, he was taken from the carriage where he was fitting with his mo|ther and &s;i&s;ter, and murdered in their view.

<P>The French have been very injudicious in attacking the various nations of Europe.

The French &s;hould have remained quiet, for &s;ome time at lea&s;t, and have e&s;tabli&s;hed a good con&s;titution of government. In this &s;ituation they would have done more by the pen in recommending the rational principles of liberty to the nations of Europe than by the &s;word. In&s;tead of this, they have attempted (as Mr. Necker &s;ays) to in&s;truct the world, "with the trumpet of di&s;cord, and from the towers of Babel."</P>
<P>Whatever may be the political up&s;hot of the conte&s;t in France, the Roman catholic religion will never be again e&s;tabli&s;hed there, or not e&s;tabli&s;hed long, according to its former tyrannical &s;uperi|ority.

It is al&s;o well ob&s;erved by a wi&s;e man in modern times, "the authority of emperors, kings, and princes, is human.
