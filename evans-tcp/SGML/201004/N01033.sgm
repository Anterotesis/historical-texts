Again he exhorted the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> (who, to be &s;ure, had al&s;o faith in Chri&s;t's outward manife&s;tation, for he called them his <HI>holy bre|thren, and partakers of the heavenly calling,</HI> Heb. 3.1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">) <HI>to follow peace with all men, and holine&s;s without which no man &s;hould &s;ee the Lord,</HI> 12.14.

<P>Again in his <HI>January</HI> month 1704.

<P>This is al&s;o a great fal&s;hood; and to &s;hew the Reader, the more plain, that it is &s;o, we have taken pains and tran&s;cribed from the begin|ning of the Chapter to &s;everal lines after tho&s;e words [the attire of the Whore] are mentioned, which take as followeth. <Q>For &s;ince the Apo|&s;tles days, their foundation hath been taken, either Traditions, Imita|tions, Inventions of their own brain, or borrowed things from the Jews in the fir&s;t Covenant, or at the be&s;t, the Letter hath been the ground of their faith and foundation, which they have turned and tran&s;lated this way, and that, according to the wit and rea&s;on of every particular Sect and opinion; and according to the under&s;tanding of their private Spi|rit: now all the&s;e Buildings and Towers that men have builded up in the Apo&s;tacy, they would fa&s;ten upon the writings of the holy men of God, and &s;o have rai&s;ed an imagination of their own, and &s;o would have the Scripture prove what they &s;ay; and the writings of the A|po&s;tles, they all call the Go&s;pel; and the word of faith, and the Light of the Go&s;pel, and the foundation and the Tryer of Spirits, and the Touch&s;tone, and &s;ay, it's the foundation of their faith and religi|on; and &s;o are all in the di&s;traction, one envying another, and per|&s;ecuting one another about the words of Truth, &s;poken from the Spi|rit of Truth, which cannot be under&s;tood again, but by the &s;ame Spi|rit, &amp; &s;o all them <HI>that have not the Spirit of Truth, are in the Apo&s;tacy; and all Sects, Judgments and Opinions that have ri&s;en up &s;ince the A|po&s;tacy from the faith that hath been once delivered to the Saints,</HI> when the Woman travailed and brought forth a Man child, which after be|cau&s;e of the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">agons power, fled into the wilderne&s;s, and her Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d was caught up unto God. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll the Faith and Wor&s;hip, that &s;ince is &s;prung up, &s;ince the Whore hath &s;itten as a Queen in Maje&s;ty, is all de|ni'd <HI>the Ground of her Wor&s;hip, Laws, Traditions, Inventions, and all their Invented Practices and Forms, and Images, and Likene&s;&s;es are de|nied and disowned, as to be the dre&s;s and attire of the whore, which hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> people through her enticing pretences, and &s;hews of holine&s;s;</HI> when indeed all is but &s;piritual adultery, and this mu&s;t be all turned

<P>Ob&s;erve reader, here is all that's mentioned of the attire of the Whore, is there any thing here &s;aid as D: L: a&s;&s;erts, viz: <HI>that the Scripture is the attire of the Whore, the fal&s;e Church which brings none to know God or Chri&s;t?</HI> No, we &s;ee it was the ground of their Wor&s;hip, Laws, &amp;c: that &s;prung up in the Apo&s;tacy, &s;ince the Whore &s;ate as a Queen, that had not the Spirit to give them the under&s;tanding of the Scripture, and all the invented Practices, Forms and Images of the divers Opinions, which they all wrongfully pretend the Scripture was the foundation of, when it was only their own twi&s;ting and turning them &amp;c: Was that he called the <HI>At|tire of the Whore;</HI> but as to the Scriptures, we &s;ee he expre&s;ly calls them <HI>the Writings of the holy men of God, words of Truth &s;poken from the Spirit of Truth &amp;c:</HI> but as the reader may &s;ee, he doth not call the Scripture <HI>the Attire of the Whore, the fal&s;e Church which brings none to know God or Chri&s;t,</HI> as this D: L: &s;o very abu&s;ively, expre&s;sly renders him to &s;ay; therefore for this al&s;o <HI>he ought to make &s;atisfaction.</HI></P>
<P>Again, &s;ee his <HI>May</HI> month 1704&punc; he cites a pa&s;&s;age of a bla&s;phemous Letter, which he &s;aith, was writ by <HI>John Audland to G: F:</HI> beginning thus <HI>Dear and precious One, in whom is my life bound up, and my &s;trength in thee &s;tands, by thy breathings I am nouri&s;hed, by thee is my &s;trength re|newed.

<P>Now as confidently as D: L: affirms this was from <HI>John Audland</HI> in a Letter to G: F: without any pretence of proof that it was &s;o. So we have many rea&s;ons to believe the contrary, &s;ome of which are aptly laid down by our friend <HI>Jo&s;eph Wyeth</HI> in page 483 of the <HI>Switch for the Snake,</HI> which rea&s;ons take as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P><Q>Some of our Adver&s;aries, as the <HI>Snake</HI> page 115. pretended to give

&s;ome pieces of it, [meaning the afore&s;aid Letter] but have contradicted one another as to the matter of it, by which contradiction in terms it is fully &s;hewn that they could not all be right, as they pretended they were. Again &s;aith he, "this pretended Letter from <HI>John Aud|land</HI> to G: F: was not &s;o well contrived, but the forgers who have here|tofore given it with a date, have made it bear date from <HI>Bri&s;toll</HI> Anno 1665. this was a very unlucky over&s;ight, which as it cannot now be mended, &s;o it ab&s;olutely overthrows the pretence of it's being his, be|cau&s;e <HI>John Audland</HI> was buried in <HI>We&s;tmoreland</HI> the 24 of the fir&s;t month 1663, being the la&s;t day of that year, &s;o that it appears he was dead about two years before the date of the pretended Letter.</Q></P>
<P>Now ob&s;erve, &s;ince D: L: hath expre&s;ly called it <HI>John Audland's</HI> Letter to G: F: upon our di&s;owning and denying it to be &s;o upon &s;uch good grounds as above, he ought to prove it as well as charge, and until he &s;o do, how can we e&s;teem him le&s;s than a fal&s;e accu&s;er of us herein al&s;o; and fo as that for which he <HI>ought to make &s;atisfaction.</HI></P>
