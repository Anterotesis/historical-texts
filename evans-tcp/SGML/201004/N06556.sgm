<HEAD>THE PROPHETIC <HI>Numbers</HI> OF DANIEL and JOHN CALCULATED, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_I Was led by extraordinary impre&s;|&s;ions to compute the numbers of <HI>Daniel</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> who are both be|loved prophets, and the counter|parts to each other: They contain the beginning and end of all the great confu&s;ion, which &s;in has brought into the works of ALEIM JEHOVAH.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I was led to con&s;ider, where the theocracy of the <HI>God</HI> of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> ended, after the ancient departure out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> when his judges or rulers were ca&s;t off by their kings.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="008320_0003_10347A6023230A78">
This fell out in 427 years, when <HI>Saul</HI> was cho&s;en: Then was I led to con&s;ider, that about this time the ANTICHRIST of fal&s;e interpretation for the go&s;pel was nouri&s;hed with great ea&s;e and honour at the courts of emperors, ea&s;tern and we&s;tern, who did as much de&s;troy the &s;pirit of the go&s;pel, as the kings of <HI>Judah</HI> and <HI>I&s;rael</HI> did the &s;pirit of the law and the prophets.</P>
<P>This was near 1095 years before the CHRIST of the ALEIM of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> who is the king or head of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> promulged again the theocracy of the triune JEHOVAH in the beloved Son.</P>
<P>From this date I was conducted to calculate the la&s;t number of <HI>Daniel</HI> in the clo&s;e of his prophecy:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. xii. 12.</NOTE>&mdash;<HI>ble&s;&s;ed and holy is he, that cometh to the thou&s;and three hundred and five and thirty days, but go thy way 'til the end be; for thou &s;halt re&s;t and &s;tand in the lot at the end of the days.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The&s;e two numbers make</HI> 1762.</P>
<P>In ver&s;e 9 <HI>Daniel</HI> was bid to go his way; for the words were <HI>clo&s;ed up</HI> and <HI>&s;ealed,</HI> 'til the <HI>time of the end:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 9.</NOTE> that is, it would not be revealed, 'til the &s;ea&s;on of its fulfilling was coming on and ex|piring. The LOT here is a term of the law, the LORD'S PORTION, or the FIRST-BORN, the leading character of that di&s;pen&s;ation.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="008320_0004_10347A5E4E645F38">
Within four years of this time, under the go&s;|pel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SIXTUS III. in the year 432.</NOTE> there was a pope, who&s;e name was Sixtus III. which period nearly agrees.</P>
<P>This ought to appear an extraordinary mark to &s;uch, who believe, that the <HI>whore of Babylon,</HI> and <HI>the great city,</HI> &s;ignify the corrupt church of Rome only: &s;ince the THIRD SIXTH in all the languages of Babylon the great, an&s;wers to 666.</P>
<P>But if this number &s;hould compo&s;e the name of the BEAST, it mu&s;t be remembered, that the <HI>whore rideth</HI> on the <HI>&s;carlet or purple coloured bea&s;t;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. xvii. 3.</NOTE> and therefore it cannot be interpreted con|fu&s;edly. For &s;he appears the &s;ame as Babylon the great, which contains all the peoples,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 5.</NOTE> and multitudes and kindreds and tongues. We mu&s;t allow that all mankind ri&s;e out of water and blood of <HI>fallen Adam,</HI> and the <HI>&s;pirit</HI> of this <HI>outer court.</HI> This is the whore, &s;itting over the&s;e <HI>waters.</HI> The 70 tongues aro&s;e in <HI>Adam</HI>'s fall, though the typical hi&s;tory be &s;hewn at old Babel. It means then in &s;piritual prophe&s;ying, that the carnal and corrupt heart, the animal man of <HI>St. Paul,</HI> the heart and fle&s;h of fallen <HI>Adam,</HI> had &s;o defiled the go&s;pel by ba&s;e in|terpretation, that the power of the bea&s;t was &s;et up upon the <HI>new &s;pirit,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 John v. 8.</NOTE> <HI>water and blood</HI> of JESUS,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezek. xi. 19.</NOTE> to be poured out upon all of the old fle&s;h. Then the &s;chools and &s;ons of the prophets were confined to a few only: And the two great leaders of the church in this age were <HI>Jerome</HI> and <HI>Au&s;tin,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Corin. xiv. 29, 30, 31, 32.</NOTE> we need not &s;ay more.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="008320_0005_10347A5CCC45F7C0">
The world, the corrupt heart &s;et up the bea&s;t, a fal&s;e interpretation to &s;ave the crucifying and living and dying with Je&s;us, becau&s;e he had done all, as was pretended, and carried away the law and the prophets;<NOTE PLACE="marg">John v. 5, 6, 7, 8.</NOTE> in&s;tead of the ble&s;|&s;ed Je&s;us opening the law and the prophets, and fulfilling his mighty powers and &s;piritual prie&s;t|hood in them, of a <HI>new &s;pirit, and water and blood,</HI> the <HI>one holy &s;eed</HI> and <HI>work</HI> that he had been, and will be doing till &s;in, and mi&s;ery its wages and cur&s;e, are no more,&mdash;<HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>As the church of <HI>Rome,</HI> by the ba&s;ene&s;s and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of other churches of <HI>Africa,</HI> had the greate&s;t hand, in bringing in one confu&s;ion and fal&s;e lip of interpretation after another, &s;he may be con&s;idered as an eminent <HI>Antichri&s;t,</HI> full of fal&s;e tongues and &s;tammering lips;<NOTE PLACE="marg">I&s;aiah xxviii. 11.</NOTE> but in what light can &s;he an&s;wer to the name <HI>My&s;tery</HI> or <HI>Babylon</HI> the great, which comprehendeth all the <HI>peoples,</HI> and <HI>tongues,</HI> and <HI>languages,</HI> and <HI>nations;</HI> and in <HI>her was found the blood of pro|phets, and of &s;aints,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. xviii. 24.</NOTE> <HI>and of all that were &s;lain upon the earth.</HI></P>
<P>Can words de&s;cribe the <HI>World</HI> more plain|ly, which our &s;aviour u&s;es &s;o continually in the go&s;pel of <HI>St. John,</HI> and he &s;catters this word through his epi&s;tles. This di&s;ciple of the <HI>bo|&s;om</HI> be&s;t knew the my&s;teries, the deep and prophetic &s;en&s;e of his ma&s;ter's kingdom.</P>
<P>There are many antichri&s;ts, &s;aith this belov|ed writer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 John ii. 18.</NOTE> who under&s;tood the full force and &s;pirit of prophe&s;ying: And antichri&s;t will come, that is, an eminent one, the church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and another, even <HI>Mahomet.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="008320_0006_10347A5B03400800">
Yet it mu&s;t be con&s;idered, that the one tem|per and di&s;po&s;ition, which &s;lew all the true in|terpreters and me&s;&s;engers of the revelation of God, in every part of the <HI>great city,</HI> which is the world, &s;lew them in <HI>Judea,</HI> and in <HI>Rome;</HI> under <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and in <HI>Gentili&s;m:</HI> They &s;lew their bodies, or rejected their interpretation by a fal&s;e lip and lying tongue &s;et up again&s;t them, which is the &s;piritual death of prophe&s;ying in the &s;en&s;e of <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> evangelical prophets, and of the ancient prophets.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I was led to compute the time, when the temple of <HI>Solomon</HI> was &s;eized by the old typical <HI>Babylonians</HI> after its building; and the &s;piritual prophets, or interpreters of that temple had written.</P>
<P>The &s;iege of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> fell out in 428, and the taking of the temple, about <HI>two</HI> years after.</P>
<P>This is near the &s;ame time as before, and would expire by adding the 1335 days of <HI>Daniel,</HI> in 1763, or 1765. This is near the &s;ame time when <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> the PROPHET of his own &s;piritual, and heavenly temple di&s;appear|ed in a manner: For after he had &s;hewn the MYSTERY which he had been doing among the 70 nations, or tongues of the world, by all the rites and figures of the law; how he had killed and &s;lain and poured out the fal&s;e water and blood of <HI>Adam,</HI> and had been pour|ing his pure and holy water, and blood and &s;pirit, which he brought to light on the cro&s;s?
<PB N="8" REF="008320_0007_10347A58E39C7868">how he had done all the parts of the true &s;a|crificer and feeder of his people: Then came the time, when the true temple and all its &s;piritual and inward prie&s;thood was over|thrown; when things imputed were &s;etting up in&s;tead of the royal ble&s;&s;ings implanted and ingrafted into the old dead tree, the tree of mortal fle&s;h, through him as the <HI>tree of life,</HI> with <HI>twelve fruits,</HI> mediating or coming be|tween our foul water and blood. For the&s;e holy powers were to quicken the dry bones, the dead earth, and ve&s;&s;els of <HI>Adam</HI>'s fallen ta|bernacle, into living &s;pirit, and water and blood, by continual union, touch and inha|bitation of the Lord of the GLORY, or the CHERUBIM over&s;hadowing the world, as the <HI>temple.</HI></P>
<P>I was then led to compute the number 666, by adding the <HI>one thou&s;and two hundred</HI> and <HI>&s;ixty</HI> days for the prophe&s;ying of the two wit|ne&s;&s;es in &s;ackcloth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. xi. 3.</NOTE> before the fal&s;e prophets &s;hould be ca&s;t down.</P>
<P>My mind was guided to con&s;ider the time, when <HI>Antiochus,</HI> a type of an in&s;olent power, and defiler of the &s;anctuary, that &s;hould ri&s;e up in the new temple, did all tho&s;e impie|ties and mocking in&s;ults on the old temple,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Mac. i.</NOTE> as recorded in <HI>Maccabees,</HI> for <HI>three</HI> years and an <HI>half.</HI> This is the number of time &s;o famous among the <HI>Jews</HI> on his account.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lightfoot.

<PB N="9" REF="008320_0008_10347A5761C45538">begin. This &s;laying of prophetic te&s;timony does not mean only &s;hedding blood, but mak|ing merry over it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jo&s;hua vii. 21.</NOTE> as this <HI>golden tongue</HI> of <HI>St. John,</HI> which is covered, de&s;cribes the peoples, and tribes, and languages, and nations, rejoic|ing over the prophets;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. xi. 9, 10, 11.</NOTE> not &s;uffering their dead bodies, their rejected prophe&s;ies, to be put in graves; that is, forgot and buried in &s;ilence, but talking of their te&s;timony, and &s;porting with it.</P>
<P>Again, The fir&s;t <HI>name</HI> of <HI>Babylon</HI> the great,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. xvii. 5.</NOTE> wrote on her <HI>forehead</HI> is <HI>my&s;tery:</HI> My&s;tery always &s;ignifies &s;omething concealed, and to be explained.

<P>Let us then join <HI>Antiochus</HI> under the law to his antitype under the go&s;pel, who ca&s;t out the <HI>my&s;tery of a life hid with Chri&s;t in</HI> GOD,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Col. iii. 3.</NOTE> to a my&s;tery of iniquity and folly, of <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> rites and figures with an heathen &s;en&s;e and meaning: And this will bring us to a time, when the fal&s;e prophet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 The&s;al. ii. 9.10.</NOTE> the lying and &s;tammer|ing lip of interpretation, had got into the tem|ple, and was working his <HI>lying wonders with all deceivablene&s;s of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;peaking lies in hypocri&s;y.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. iv. 2.</NOTE></P>

<PB N="24" REF="008320_0023_10347A3E245AF220">began in 428 years after the building of the tem|ple. Under the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> the <HI>prince</HI> of peace, and <HI>Lord</HI> of the true temple, &s;piritual interpretation cea&s;ed about this time. If we mea&s;ure this period by 1335 days of <HI>Daniel,</HI> they will expire in 1763, or 1765.</P>
<P>The number of <HI>St. John</HI> of 666 and 1260 days for the prophets in <HI>&s;ackcloth</HI> added together,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. xi. 3.</NOTE> make 1926 years. Mea&s;ure this period from <HI>Antiochus</HI> who defiled the temple under <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> 167 or 168 years before <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> to his antitype of the go&s;pel, or the power of <HI>Anti|chri&s;t:</HI> This will lead us to the year of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> 1758, or 1759.</P>
<P>Again. Let us compute the period of the <HI>Baby|lonian Thalmud</HI> proclaimed after <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> in the year 500, or 505: reckon 1260 days or years, before <HI>Me&s;es</HI> and the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. xi.</NOTE> <HI>two witne&s;&s;es of God</HI> ri&s;e and come forth: and this will reach to the year 1760, or 1765.</P>
<P>If we reckon the number of <HI>Daniel</HI> in chap. viii. 12, 13. of 2300 days appointed for the clean&s;ing of the <HI>&s;anctuary,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. v.</NOTE> from <HI>Bel&s;hazzar</HI>'s impious fea&s;t, and the taking of the typical <HI>Babylon</HI> 538 years before <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> this will conclude in 1762 of our time.</P>
<P>The <HI>cutting &s;hort</HI> of this fir&s;t <HI>age</HI> of the go&s;pel has been fully explained: So that the only number of <HI>Daniel</HI> remaining is the 1290 days from the taking away the <HI>daily oblation.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. xii. 11.</NOTE></P>
<P>The&s;e appear to be days of jubilees and centuries, who&s;e meaning I have opened in page 18 and 19; according to my light, and the gift of <HI>God</HI> in <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>witne&s;&s;es</HI> of God in <HI>prophetic numbers</HI> concur|ring &s;o nearly in time are left to &s;peak for them&s;elves. May the <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> of <HI>God anoint</HI> our eyes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. iii. 18.</NOTE> that <HI>we may &s;ee</HI> and be <HI>wi&s;e to under&s;tand</HI> the <HI>&s;igns</HI> of the <HI>times.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. xii. 10.</NOTE></P>
