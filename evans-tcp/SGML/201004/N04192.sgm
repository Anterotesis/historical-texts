<HEAD>An Enquiry into ENTHUSIASM.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Corruption and Depravity of humane Nature is a Thing &s;o plainly di&s;covered and &s;o frequently acknowleged, that it is needle&s;s to endeavour to prove it.</P>
<P>And tho' Man be evidently &s;uch a Stranger to GOD and &s;uch an Enemy to him, yet there is evi|dently &s;uch a <HI>&s;trong Inclination</HI> in the Hearts of Men to <HI>&s;omething</HI> that is called RELIGION, as makes it Matter of Admiration to all wi&s;e and con&s;idering Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Indeed <HI>true Religion</HI> is &s;o <HI>heavenly and divine a Thing,</HI> and bears &s;uch a Re&s;emblance of the <HI>true</HI> GOD, that it may &s;eem very <HI>&s;trange</HI> indeed, that there &s;hould be <HI>any Inclination</HI> in the Hearts of Men to it. And yet in all Ages of the World, among all Nations, there is plainly &s;o <HI>&s;trong an Inclination and Readine&s;s</HI> to fall in with &s;omething, that bears the Name of <HI>Religion,</HI> that it is truly <HI>wonderful</HI> to behold.</P>
<P>For there is nothing that &s;o &s;uddenly prevails, and like a mighty Torrent bears down all before it, as this <HI>strong Inclination</HI> does: &s;o that if any come to Men under Pretence of <HI>large Communications from the divine</HI> BEING, and pretend to make them <HI>Sharers</HI> in it, this <HI>&s;uddenly</HI> takes with them, and like <HI>Wild-Fire diffu&s;es</HI> it&s;elf every where.</P>
<P>And therefore there mu&s;t undeniably be &s;ome <HI>&s;trong Inclination</HI> in humane Nature that Way, or there could not be &s;uch a <HI>&s;udden Alteration</HI> made among Men, as there often is. I know indeed, that 'tis al|ways
<PB N="6" REF="005167_0004_1016CC2007849368">pretended to proceed <HI>from the Power and Effi|cacy of the divine</HI> SPIRIT, which makes &s;uch a <HI>wonder|ful and &s;udden Alteration.</HI> But every one mu&s;t and and will acknowledge, that it does not always proceed from this Cau&s;e: for I cannot think any will be <HI>&s;o di&s;tracted</HI> as to impute the &s;udden Progre&s;s of the <HI>Per&s;ian Magi,</HI> and the almo&s;t innumerable Heathen Religions, or the &s;udden Alterations made in the Religion of the Jewi&s;h Nation to the Wor&s;hip of <HI>Baal,</HI> or <HI>Jereboam</HI>'s Golden Calves, and the &s;udden Alterations made by <HI>Mahomet</HI> in Religion, and all the great and &s;urprizing Alterations that <HI>Antichri&s;t</HI> has made in the <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion;</HI> I &s;ay, I think none will attribute all the&s;e to the <HI>powerful Efficacy of the</HI> HOLY SPIRIT: For there are &s;o many <HI>horrible Con|tradictions,</HI> and <HI>abominable Things</HI> advanced by many, that it is <HI>impo&s;&s;ible</HI> to be <HI>all divine.</HI> So that what|ever is pretended, it mu&s;t mo&s;t certainly &s;ometimes proceed from &s;ome other Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>There mu&s;t then be &s;omething in-laid in the pre|&s;ent Frame and Con&s;titution of humane Nature, that <HI>like Tinder,</HI> mu&s;t be ready to <HI>catch every Spark of this Fire that is &s;truck into it:</HI> For if there be not, it will be impo&s;&s;ible to account for &s;uch <HI>&s;trange Ap|pearances</HI> as have often happened in the World.</P>
<P>When I have con&s;idered the&s;e <HI>&s;trange Appearan|ces</HI> in the World in former Ages, at &s;everal di&s;tant Periods of Time, and many of them &s;o contrary to one another; and yet as great, quick, powerful, one as the other, I could not but think that though they were &s;o contrary one to the other, yet they mu&s;t <HI>all proceed from one and the &s;ame Principle in hu|mane Nature:</HI> Becau&s;e they all &s;eem to operate in the <HI>&s;ame Manner</HI> and produce much the <HI>&s;ame Effects</HI> among Men, and therefore I think, it may not be ami&s;s to enquire into this <HI>Principle, what 'tis called;</HI> the <HI>original from whence it proceeds, the Method of its
<PB N="7" REF="005167_0005_1016CC22889422F0">Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s,</HI> when it makes a <HI>great Appearance</HI> in the World, and the <HI>proper and genuine Fruits and Effects</HI> of it among Men.</P>
<P N="1">1. Then we may enquire, <HI>what this is, which has &s;uch wonderful Effects.</HI> And this I apprehend has generally gone under the Name of ENTHUSIASM, a <HI>Greek</HI> Word that in <HI>Latin</HI> is rendred <HI>Numine Affla|tus:</HI> i. e. a <HI>Strong Fancy, Imagination</HI> or <HI>Conceit</HI> of having <HI>large Communications</HI> from, or <HI>Participations of the Deity.</HI></P>
<P>It is therefore a <HI>powerful Impre&s;&s;ion</HI> or <HI>Impul&s;e</HI> made upon the <HI>Imagination,</HI> of having &s;ome <HI>great and wonderful Communications</HI> from God, &s;o as to be made in a very <HI>high Degree</HI> Partaker of that which is <HI>heavenly</HI> and <HI>divine;</HI> and therefore this exalts them in their own Thoughts, as being highly favoured of God, or the <HI>peculiar Favourites</HI> of Heaven; and therefore they <HI>look down</HI> upon others as <HI>poor, mi&s;era|ble Wretches that are going down to Hell.</HI></P>
<P>And this <HI>high Conceit</HI> of them&s;elves &s;trongly warms their Imaginations, and makes them <HI>full of Life and Fire:</HI> And therefore they look upon others as <HI>dead Souls,</HI> that partake not of this <HI>warm imaginary Fire.</HI> And this makes them evermore de&s;pi&s;e REASON as an evil and dangerous <HI>Guide</HI> in Matters of Religion, and &s;ub&s;titute <HI>&s;eeing</HI> and <HI>feeling</HI> in the Room of it, they &s;ee &s;uch heavenly and divine Things <HI>clearly,</HI> and <HI>feel</HI> them <HI>&s;trong</HI> in their Souls, and therefore de&s;pi&s;e all <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>Argument</HI> as a <HI>mean, dull</HI> and <HI>beggarly</HI> Thing.</P>
<P><HI>They &s;ee and feel</HI> (they &s;ay) <HI>and therefore believe and are &s;ure.</HI></P>
<P>They have a <HI>quick</HI> and <HI>&s;udden Way</HI> of coming at heavenly and divine Things; and this fills them with the <HI>highe&s;t Extacies</HI> of <HI>Joy</HI> and <HI>Comfort:</HI> The&s;e they <HI>&s;ee,</HI> and <HI>feel</HI> and think they can't be mi&s;taken in; and therefore care not for all hat can be &s;aid
<PB N="8" REF="005167_0006_1016CC24E124DD00">again&s;t them: And therefore will not enquire any further.</P>
<P>Thus I have given a brief Account of what I take to be ENTHUSIASM, which all Mankind have &s;uch a <HI>Fond|ne&s;s for,</HI> and are &s;o ready to fall in with; that were it not for the powerful Interpo&s;ition of the DIVINE BEING, they would all be overwhelmed with it. For nothing is more agreeable to corrupted humane Na|ture, and nothing more mi&s;chievous to it than this.</P>
<P N="2">2. We &s;hall enquire into the <HI>Original of it,</HI> or <HI>from whence this does proceed?</HI></P>
<P>Certainly this was not the original Con&s;titution of humane Nature. For humane Nature did once mo&s;t &s;urely partake of the divine; and had frequent and great Communications from the Deity: And this was not a <HI>meer imaginary Thing,</HI> but <HI>true</HI> and <HI>real.</HI> How then, and when <HI>came this wonderful Principle, Inclination,</HI> or <HI>Tendency</HI> of humane Nature, to be &s;o firmly in-laid or interwoven into the very Frame and Con&s;titution of humane Nature, that now nothing &s;eems more natural to it than this, even a <HI>&s;trong In|clination</HI> to <HI>&s;omething they call Religion.</HI></P>
<P>Many wi&s;e and learned Men have written of EN|THUSIASM, and di&s;cour&s;ed well concerning it; but none I ever met with have ever given an Account of the <HI>Original of it:</HI> And therefore &s;eem to be at a Lo&s;s, why it &s;hould &s;o &s;uddenly pre|vail and bear down all before it, as 'tis evident that many Times it has done. Witne&s;s that of the <HI>Magi</HI> in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> that of <HI>Jeroboam</HI> among the ten Tribes, and that of <HI>Baal</HI> among the &s;ame Tribes &s;oon after, &s;o al&s;o that of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and that of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> or <HI>Antichri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Now I think, we need not be at a Lo&s;s, why it has done thus, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> we con&s;ider the <HI>Original of it:</HI> And I think the Original of this &s;ufficiently di&s;co|vered
<PB N="9" REF="005167_0007_1016CC2740DE7D08">to us <HI>Gen.</HI> 3.1, to 7. Here we have an Account of the fir&s;t Temptation, that was ever offered to human Nature, to &s;in; and with which our fir&s;t Parents complied, &s;inned and fell. If therefore we may judge that Man's <HI>original Sin</HI> was proportiona|ble, or in any Mea&s;ure agreeable to the Temptation that was offered, we mu&s;t conclude that ENTHUSIASM was Man's <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> or <HI>Original Sin. Ye &s;hall be as Gods,</HI> (&s;aid the Temptes) that he might prevail upon our fir&s;t Parents to eat the forbidden Fruit. i. e. Ye &s;hall partake of a much <HI>larger Portion</HI> of the DEITY, or <HI>&s;piritual and divine Knowledge and Wi&s;dom,</HI> than ever yet ye have done. And why did they eat of it? Was it not mo&s;t certainly for the very End and De&s;ign propo&s;ed in the Temptation? even that they might <HI>be as Gods.</HI> For nothing el&s;e could prevail upon innocent Nature to tran&s;gre&s;s a plain po&s;itive and known Prohibition but this, that they might par|take more of Divinity than as yet they had done. So that they might ea&s;ily think, that it was no Harm at all to be more like God than now they were. It mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed that Man was at fir&s;t made in the <HI>Likene&s;s of God</HI> as we read, <HI>Gen.</HI> 1.27. And from hence had a true and &s;trong Tendency towards God, as his proper Center; and mu&s;t therefore de&s;ire to be as much like him as po&s;&s;ibly he could be. <HI>Satan</HI> that now de&s;ired to deform him, could not po&s;&s;ibly think of a more likely Cour&s;e to effect his De&s;ign, than to come in upon this Inclination and blind it, by propo&s;ing a more ready and &s;peedy Way of arriving to a greater Degree of this; by di&s;co|vering &s;omething to him, that which might have this &s;udden and quick Operation, without the &s;low and ordinary Method of God's appointing and e&s;tabli&s;h|ing. The Policy and Subtilty of Satan no le&s;s ap|pears in hiding the Mi&s;chief of breaking a plain Pro|hibition: <HI>God knows</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>that in the Day ye eat
<PB N="10" REF="005167_0008_1016CC292E005E00">thereof ye &s;hall not die, but be as Gods, knowing Good and Evil.</HI></P>
<P>No Que&s;tion the Apo&s;tle refers to this very Time, 2 Cor. 11.14. when he &s;ays that Satan him&s;elf <HI>is transformed into an Angel of Light:</HI> Though he is here &s;aid to &s;peak to the Woman in the Shape of a Ser|pent, yet even in that Shape he comes as an <HI>An|gel of Light,</HI> as though he came upon a &s;pecial Er|rand to our fir&s;t Mother <HI>Eve</HI> to di&s;cover to her the hidden Virtue of this Fruit, which they knew not before. And this he informs her had the Power to a&s;&s;imilate them in a greater Mea&s;ure to the Divine Being. And thus his Plot is deep laid; he comes as an <HI>Angel of Light</HI> with a <HI>&s;pecial Me&s;&s;age</HI> from God to her, to make her more like God him&s;elf than ever yet &s;he had been.</P>
<P>Now, what could <HI>innocent Nature</HI> have to fear? Here comes an <HI>Angel of Light</HI> to di&s;cover to her how &s;he might become more like GOD him&s;elf than now &s;he was; and this agreeing with the original De&s;ire and Tendency of her Nature, mu&s;t appear eligible if nothing &s;tood in the Way to make it appear o|therwi&s;e; and for this there was nothing but GOD'S revealed po&s;itive Prohibition, and certain &s;he was &s;he did not yet know all that was to be known, and might not &s;he think that the Meaning of this In|terdiction was no more than that they &s;hould not eat of it, until a further Di&s;covery was made about it? And &s;ince &s;he had the Knowledge of this In|terdiction only by Tradition from her Husband (for &s;he was not made when this Interdiction was given him) might &s;he not as well believe an <HI>Angel of Light</HI> as him, when as that <HI>Angel of Light</HI> di&s;covers that which &s;hould make her more like GOD, which &s;he had &s;uch a <HI>&s;trong De&s;ire</HI> to: And therefore find|ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> to her <HI>natural De&s;ire,</HI> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>wi&s;e,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>more like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> him&s;elf,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="005167_0009_1016CC2AC51B4428">
Thus &s;he follows the De&s;ire of being more like GOD in <HI>Knowledge</HI> and Wi&s;dom than &s;he was; and eats in Oppo&s;ition to a plain po&s;itive Command of GOD: &s;he <HI>&s;teps over that Order</HI> which GOD had &s;et for her to walk according to; and <HI>regards not the Reve|lation</HI> that GOD had already made, and follows a <HI>new one,</HI> that &s;he know not, <HI>who</HI> it came from, or whe|ther <HI>he</HI> that brought it was <HI>&s;ent</HI> of GOD or no.</P>
<P>Her <HI>Imagination</HI> had a <HI>&s;trong Impre&s;&s;ion</HI> made up|on it, that the <HI>Di&s;covery was Divine;</HI> and her <HI>Pa&s;|&s;ions</HI> were <HI>warmed</HI> with <HI>great Expectations</HI> and <HI>De&s;ires</HI> of partaking more of the <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>Knowledge</HI> of GOD than ever yet &s;he had done.</P>
<P>And upon eating (no Que&s;tion) her <HI>Imagination</HI> was filled with <HI>great and wonderful Di&s;coveries</HI> by this Means made to her, and therefore out of <HI>Love</HI> to her Husband urges him to do the like.</P>
<P>For having found the Benefit of it, &s;he is <HI>di&s;tre&s;|&s;ed</HI> for her Husband, that he might <HI>&s;hare</HI> al&s;o in the <HI>&s;ame:</HI> And therefore &s;he gives him of this &s;ame <HI>wonderful Fruit,</HI> and very probably relates to him, <HI>what an angelick Di&s;covery</HI> &s;he had concerning it, and her <HI>own Experiences</HI> upon eating it, and by the &s;ame per&s;wades him to take and eat. And thus both be|came <HI>tinctured</HI> with the &s;ame <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;tic Spirit,</HI> they are <HI>puffed up</HI> with it, until God opens their Eyes, i. e. Awakens their Con&s;ciences, to &s;ee what they had done, and then they &s;oon <HI>&s;ee</HI> their <HI>Mi&s;take,</HI> when it was too late to prevent it; for then they &s;ee them|&s;elves naked, i. e. Stript of tho&s;e Rays of Glory and Honour, which were their Cloathing before.</P>
<P>Thus our fir&s;t Parent's <HI>Sin,</HI> which was fini&s;hed or compleated, by eating the forbidden Fruit, did bear an exact Proportion to the Temptation offered. It began in <HI>Pride</HI> and <HI>De&s;ire</HI> to <HI>know more</HI> and be <HI>great|er</HI> than God had allowed them to know or be; and
<PB N="12" REF="005167_0010_1016CC2EA74BB528">was fini&s;hed or compleated, by acting in <HI>plain Con|tradiction</HI> to a <HI>known revealed</HI> Prohibition of GOD.</P>
<P>Thus ENTHUSIASM was Man's <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> or <HI>original Sin;</HI> and it evermore keeps the &s;ame Pace, even to this Day. For to this Day it fills the <HI>Imagination</HI> and <HI>Fancy,</HI> no with <HI>real Di&s;coveries</HI> of &s;piritual and divine Things; but with a <HI>Fancy</HI> or <HI>Conceit,</HI> of being made like God; and being more acquainted with the <HI>Secrets of the mo&s;t High</HI> than others not like them are, or than GOD has al|lowed them to know or be. And it is fini&s;hed even to this Day, by violating the <HI>plain Revelations</HI> GOD has made to Men, and the <HI>Order</HI> he has e&s;tabli&s;hed a|mong them. For it always pretends a more <HI>intimate Acquaintance with Heaven,</HI> than to be <HI>tied up to &s;uch Things as the&s;e.</HI> Thus they break the plain Com|mands of God and the Order he has e&s;tabli&s;hed, un|der Pretence of <HI>knowing immediately from God,</HI> what Order he would have. I cannot &s;ee but that Man's <HI>original Sin</HI> which is imputed to, and has infected the whole Race of Mankind, was properly ENTHUSIASM. For the Account we have of it carries all the <HI>Marks</HI> of ENTHUSIASM upon it. 'Tis therefore <HI>no Wonder</HI> that all Mankind are &s;o <HI>fond</HI> of it, and &s;o ready to <HI>fall</HI> in with it. For this is now &s;o <HI>&s;trongly riveted</HI> in the very Con&s;titution of human Nature, that whate|ver is proper to draw it forth into Act, makes <HI>Men run wild after it,</HI> as the Apo&s;tle intimates, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.4. For this has &s;o <HI>di&s;ordered</HI> and as it were <HI>intoxicated</HI> all the Powers and Faculties of human Nature, that nothing makes &s;uch a <HI>&s;udden Progre&s;s</HI> among them, as this is won't to do. No Sin does ever &s;o <HI>&s;uddenly prevail</HI> as this; for this is as it were the <HI>Seed</HI> and <HI>Source</HI> of all the Re&s;t, for a <HI>Flood of Iniquity</HI> is won't to follow a &s;trong Fit of <HI>ENTHUSIASM.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> But here &s;ome may &s;ay, If this be &s;o na|tural to Mankind, as to be inlaid in the Frame and Con&s;titution of the whole, and be as it were the
<PB N="13" REF="005167_0011_1016CC30347FB280">Source of all other Sins, what is the Rea&s;on that &s;o many both of <HI>good</HI> and <HI>bad</HI> Men appear again&s;t it?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> To this I an&s;wer, that &s;ome are more in|clined to one Sin, and &s;ome to another, from the ve|ry Frame and Con&s;titution of their Bodies. But this I take not to be the chief or main Rea&s;on why it is &s;o, but this, viz. That God interpo&s;es to pre|vent the Flood of Ruin that the Prevalency of EN|THUSIASM would bring upon all Mankind, and that he might pre&s;erve a Number that &s;hall faithfully bear Te&s;timony for him again&s;t all &s;uch as will fol|low <HI>this Sin,</HI> and render them without Excu&s;e at la&s;t, becau&s;e both good and bad Men bore Te&s;ti|mony again&s;t it: Thus God has done in all Ages of the World, not only among his own People, as we may read in the &s;acred Oracles, but al&s;o among the Heathen, and in later Times among the <HI>Mahometans</HI> and <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> which are the two great ENTHUSIASMS now extant in the World at this Day; or at lea&s;t, they may be called the <HI>two greate&s;t,</HI> and which there is the greate&s;t Strife to reduce all Men to. But God has all along pre&s;erved a Number that have <HI>faithfully</HI> born Te&s;timony again&s;t them as a Thing very plainly oppo&s;ite to the <HI>plain Revelation</HI> that God has made of him&s;elf to Sinners, and the <HI>Order</HI> he has e&s;tabli&s;hed among them.</P>
<P>How the ENTHUSIASM which infected our fir&s;t Pa|rents, and di&s;ordered all their Powers and Faculties of Body and Soul, &s;hould be conveyed and tran&s;mit|ted to their Po&s;terity, even to the late&s;t Generation, is an Enquiry too great and difficult (it may be) to be an&s;wered, while this our State of Darkne&s;s and Ignorance remains. For though we may be unde|niable Arguments prove that it is &s;o, yet the <HI>Man|ner</HI> and <HI>Method how</HI> may be beyond our Depth to fathom. But thus much I think we may &s;afely ven|ture
<PB N="14" REF="005167_0012_1016B81F92959568">to &s;ay, <HI>That God has e&s;tabli&s;hed it &s;o to be, as a Fruit of the Cur&s;e annexed to their eating the forbidden Fruit.</HI> And &s;urely GOD has Power to make his Cau|&s;es take Place, <HI>when</HI> and <HI>where</HI> and as <HI>long</HI> as he plea&s;es. And his Ju&s;tice herein is &s;ufficiently vin|dicated by the publick and repre&s;entative Station in which our fir&s;t Parents &s;tood; though we are ne|ver &s;o much at a Lo&s;s how he makes them take Ef|fect, and therefore we mu&s;t con&s;ider that this is in|cluded in that <HI>Sentence of Death,</HI> that GOD pa&s;&s;ed up|on Mankind in our fir&s;t Parents, upon their eating the <HI>forbidden Fruit.</HI></P>
<P>Thus I think I have given a true and genuine Ac|count of the <HI>Origin</HI> or <HI>Source</HI> of ENTHUSIASM; how it <HI>fir&s;t of all</HI> infected the humane Race; and it may &s;erve to take off the <HI>Wonderment</HI> that is made at its &s;o great and &s;udden Prevalency among Mankind many Times: Becau&s;e there is <HI>&s;o &s;trong and Inclina|tion</HI> in humane Nature <HI>that Way,</HI> that it may not &s;eem &s;trange that it &s;hould &s;o <HI>&s;uddenly blaze out,</HI> when proper Means are u&s;ed for this End.

<P>This indeed though more ea&s;ily di&s;covered than the Original of it, as being more near our own Ob|&s;ervation, yet has no &s;mall Difficulties attending it.

<P>The&s;e and much more of the like Nature are &s;uch plain Facts, often to be &s;een in the <HI>Ri&s;e</HI> and <HI>Growth</HI> of ENTHUSIASM, in all Ages of the World, that none but &s;uch as are be&s;otted with it ever will deny.

<P N="4">4. We may enquire what are the <HI>true, proper</HI> and <HI>genuine Fruits and Effects</HI> of it? There is &s;uch an endle&s;s Variety of the&s;e, and full of &s;uch <HI>amazing Contradictions,</HI> that a rea&s;onable Man would be almo&s;t ready to think it impo&s;&s;ible for them all to proceed from <HI>one</HI> and the <HI>&s;ame Principle.</HI></P>
<P>Yet &s;uch a prolifick Principle of Error may well bring forth innumerable, as well as amazing Con|tradictions, &s;ince Rea&s;on and Judgment is not al|low'd with &s;uch to hold the Reins of Government, but Fancy, Imagination and Impul&s;e, mu&s;t guide and govern all.</P>
<P>And &s;hould a Man e&s;&s;ay to give a Detail of all the natural Fruits and Effects of this Principle, in all its wild Excur&s;ions, he would &s;carce know where to be|gin, or where to end.</P>
<P>We &s;hall therefore only mention &s;ome few of them; out of which innumerable others do ari&s;e, and make &s;uch &s;trange, and almo&s;t unaccountable Appearances in the World. And they are &s;uch as the&s;e,</P>
<P N="1">1. A great <HI>Contempt of all Rea&s;on, and Argument, or Enquiry;</HI> and comparing of Things, to make a right Judgment. This lays the Foundation for all Manner of <HI>wild, &s;en&s;ele&s;s</HI> and <HI>extravagant Things,</HI> to be tho't <HI>right,</HI> pur&s;ued, and practi&s;ed.</P>
<P>Man's Power of Rea&s;oning, and perceiving the Agreement, or Di&s;agreement of Things, and of com|paring one Thing with another, was originally given him, to &s;ettle his Judgment right; and to prepare him for a wi&s;e Conduct and Behaviour. And though Sin has rendered it very lame and weak, yet it is not wholly lo&s;t, and po&s;&s;ibly God may have pre&s;erved &s;o much of it as there is left, for this very
<PB N="19" REF="005167_0017_1016CC3CD79A30C8">Purpo&s;e and De&s;ign, that he may be capable of be|ing treated with agreeable to his <HI>original Nature.</HI> For God conde&s;cends <HI>now to rea&s;on with him.</HI> I&s;a. 1.18. And that by this Means he may re&s;tore the Divine Image in him.</P>
<P>But however that be, 'tis plain that there is &s;till <HI>this Power</HI> remaining, though very dark and weak. And we cannot but &s;ee if we read Divine Revela|tions, that the De&s;ign of them are not <HI>wholly to ex|tingui&s;h this Candle of the Lord,</HI> as 'tis called, <HI>Prov.</HI> 20.27. but to &s;trengthen it, that it may <HI>burn more bright,</HI> and clear than it did before; and furni&s;h it with tho&s;e Di&s;coveries, which, in its lame, and lan|gui&s;hing Condition, it was utterly <HI>uncapable</HI> of making.</P>
<P>But ENTHUSIASM in&s;tead of a&s;&s;i&s;ting, and &s;treng|thening this noble Power, labours to put it wholly out; and to &s;et up a <HI>&s;trong Impul&s;e</HI> upon the Fancy or Imagination in&s;tead of it.</P>
<P>For it per&s;wades Men to think, that this is clear|er <HI>and better than Rea&s;on;</HI> and that it affords more Light, and quicker Di&s;patch in forming the Judgment, than Rea&s;on could po&s;&s;ibly do.</P>
<P>They therefore condemn <HI>all Rea&s;on</HI> as a <HI>carnal Thing,</HI> and yet &s;et up their imaginary <HI>&s;eeing and feel|ing</HI> in&s;tead of it.</P>
<P>Whereas &s;eeing and feeling, taken in a <HI>&s;trict Sen&s;e,</HI> and without any Figure, are nothing but <HI>carnal, and &s;en&s;ual</HI> Things. For what is &s;eeing, and feeling but &s;omething that relates to our bodily Sen&s;es. And if it be &s;aid that this is meant of the &s;eeing, and feeling of the Soul: I would ask them, How they can di&s;tingui&s;h this from that which ari&s;es from the Body? Is it not becau&s;e the <HI>Impre&s;&s;ion is &s;trong,</HI> &s;udden and violent? But is it not often &s;o with tho&s;e of the Body? What then makes the Dif|ference? Is it imagined to be from <HI>a Spirit?</HI> But
<PB N="20" REF="005167_0018_1016CC3EDC714BB8">how do they know it is &s;o? The &s;trong Imagina|tion that 'tis from <HI>a Spirit,</HI> cannot make it certain to them or others that 'tis &s;o. But if it be from a Spirit, How do they know that 'tis from <HI>a good Spirit?</HI> Have not <HI>evil Spirits</HI> often Times Power to make &s;uch Impre&s;&s;ions? It they have not, how came the fal&s;e Prophets of old, and the &s;ooth&s;aying Dam&s;el mentioned in <HI>Acts</HI> 16.16. &amp;c. to have &s;uch Impre&s;&s;ion? How came they to &s;ee and feel &s;uch Things as mo&s;t certainly they did, as 'twas with <HI>A-hab</HI>'s Prophets, 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 22.6, 11, 12, 21, 22, 23, 30. <HI>Lam.</HI> 2.14. and <HI>Jer.</HI> 23.15, 21. If this be an&s;|wered, that it is known by the Things impre&s;&s;ed, be|cau&s;e it is contrary to the <HI>Intere&s;t of Satan's King|dom.</HI> To this I an&s;wer, <HI>How do they know it is &s;o?</HI> And therefore further ask, May we not &s;ay that all revealed Truths contained in the Word of GOD are contrary to Satan's Kingdom? How then came Sa|tan by the Power of urging the Holy Scriptures to <HI>tempt our Saviour</HI> withal. <HI>Matth.</HI> 4.6. Why may not Satan urge <HI>one Truth</HI> in &s;uch a Manner as to o|verthrow another <HI>more important one;</HI> and not in the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> hurt his own Kingdom? Why may he not per&s;wade Per&s;ons to leave one Way of Sinning to fa&s;ten them more &s;trongly in another, and not in the lea&s;t hurt his own Kingdom? What Da|mage will it be to Satan's Kingdom, to fright Men from Drunkenne&s;s, Uncleanne&s;s, Lying, Stealing, vain Company-keeping, &amp;c And fa&s;ten &s;uch Per|&s;ons in a firm Belief that his Impul&s;es and Impre&s;|&s;ions are Revelations from GOD, and Impre&s;&s;ions of the Holy Spirit? And withal puff them up with &s;piritual Pride, and Self-Conceit, and not hurt his own Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;ee how, in the lea&s;t, Satan's Kingdom will be de&s;troyed by &s;uch a Method; but rather e|&s;tabli&s;hed by it, becau&s;e this is harder to di&s;cern,
<PB N="21" REF="005167_0019_1016CC40999D7308">and more difficult to e&s;cape out of the Snare. This then is the Fruit and Effect of Enthu&s;ia&s;m, <HI>to de|&s;pi&s;e Rea&s;on as a carnal and &s;en&s;ual Thing,</HI> and &s;ub&s;ti|tute &s;omething &s;till <HI>more</HI> carnal and &s;en&s;ual in the Room of it.</P>
<P>And thus they put them&s;elves out of the Power of di&s;tingui&s;hing what is right from what is wrong. For this cannot be done but by Man's Rea&s;oning and perceptive Power, by which he compares Things to form his Judgment. And by di&s;regarding this, they expo&s;e them&s;elves to be cheated in the mo&s;t important Ca&s;e. And what wild extravagant Things, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>heated Fancy</HI> and Imagination produce; that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> kept in by the Bit and Bridle of <HI>true</HI> Rea&s;on and Under&s;tanding? For this will work Wonders upon the Body as well as Mind, becau&s;e it &s;hares &s;o much of the bodily Sen&s;es and Pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>It is no Ways &s;trange, if this be once let loo&s;e from the Re&s;traints of true Rea&s;on, that it &s;hould produce <HI>Convul&s;ions, Swoonings, Screamings,</HI> and all &s;uch Things, which are the natural Effects of a warm, and wild Imagination, frighted by Noi&s;e, and <HI>great &s;welling Words.</HI> For 'tis natural to have <HI>&s;uch Effects</HI> upon the Body as well as <HI>Trances, Vi&s;ions, Joys, and Extacies</HI> in the Mind.</P>
<P N="2">2. But then another natural Effect of prevailing ENTHUSIASM, is <HI>Faith without a good Foundation.</HI></P>
<P>This indeed enters into the <HI>very Nature</HI> of En|thu&s;ia&s;m. For as it <HI>contemns</HI> and <HI>&s;lights</HI> all Rea&s;on, and gains its A&s;cendant over all that are willing to quit the Conduct of it; &s;o it makes them believe <HI>very &s;trongly without any good Foundation. Faith</HI> is evermore (when true) the yielding up our <HI>A&s;&s;ent</HI> and <HI>Con&s;ent</HI> to any Thing truly te&s;tified to us by <HI>God him&s;elf;</HI> and therefore when Faith is true and genuine, it is always an hearty Submi&s;&s;ion to the di|vine <HI>Authority,</HI> and an acquie&s;cing freely in tho&s;e
<PB N="22" REF="005167_0020_1016CC4492553108">Revelations, or Difcoveries, God makes to us, where our natural Faculties, or Powers had not Abili|ty to di&s;cover them: Or in all the Obligations which both Rea&s;on and divine Revelation have truly made known to us. And this Principle truly fixed in the Soul, prepares us to act in due Proportion, to what God has te&s;tified to us. And the Rea&s;on why we are thus obliged to &s;ubmit and act, is becau&s;e God is the Revealer <HI>with whom it is impo&s;&s;ible to lie, de|ceive, or be deceived.</HI> And it is impo&s;&s;ible for the Mind thus to acquie&s;ce, and act without thus rely|ing &s;olely and entirely on the divine Authority, and there is always good Rea&s;on that it &s;hould do &s;o, wherever any Thing is <HI>revealed by God.</HI></P>
<P>But here the great Que&s;tion is, How do we know that &s;uch, or &s;uch a Thing has the Stamp of <HI>divine Authority</HI> upon it? If it has, there the Mind may re&s;t &s;afely. But how may this be known, for if this be not known, the Mind mu&s;t re&s;t, upon a very uncertain Foundation, if it does re&s;t at all. But here in this important Ca&s;e, ENTHUSIASM ever more fails of Proof, and clear Evidence. For it fir&s;t di&s;|gards <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> its old Friend, and throws it by as a u&s;e|le&s;s Thing in Matters of Religion, and therefore cannot now expect that it &s;hould afford its Help at a dead Lift. Indeed in the mo&s;t important Point they bid Defiance to it, even to prove that the Re|velation is from God: and therefore do not build their Faith upon a good Foundation.</P>
<P>Object. But it may be &s;ome will here object; can there be no <HI>immediate</HI> Communications from GOD to the Soul that can be perceived to be from GOD by its <HI>own Light,</HI> or by <HI>Intuition only</HI> without the Help of any Deduction of <HI>Rea&s;on?</HI> Was it not &s;o with the <HI>Prophets</HI> of old? Did not they by <HI>in|tuitice</HI> Evidence, &s;ee it to be from God, &s;o as not
<PB N="23" REF="005167_0021_1016CC471ADAB9B0">to be deceived, nor need the Help of <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> to pre|vent it?</P>
<P>An&s;w. To this I may reply, that tho' I cannot tell all the Evidence they had that their Revelations were from the true God only; yet I conceive God never left him&s;elf without a clear Witne&s;s in this Regard, nor expo&s;ed them to the Impo&s;&s;ibility of di&s;tingui&s;hing Truth from Fal&s;hood, and Realities from Delu&s;ions, and that therefore in his fir&s;t Di&s;|coveries made to them, he always gave them &s;ome clear <HI>rational Evidence,</HI> that it was the true GOD that &s;pake to them; and did not leave them at Uncer|tainty in this Point, without a <HI>&s;ufficient Mark</HI> to make the di&s;tinction. He might &s;o far &s;trengthen their Rea&s;on and Under&s;tanding as to perceive the clear and undeniable Agreement of his Manner of revealing him&s;elf with the divine Perfections, and by this &s;atisfy them the Revelation was from the true GOD: And then as to after Revelations, they might by the Help of Rea&s;on di&s;cover whe|ther the Manner of their Communication did agree with the former, and by this be &s;ufficiently &s;atisfied, that they were from God. For we can have no ju&s;t Rea&s;on to think, that GOD, in communicating him&s;elf to a <HI>rational Creature,</HI> will not give a <HI>rational Evidence,</HI> that the Communication is certainly from him. For we plainly &s;ee that when he &s;ent his Pro|phets upon any &s;pecial Me&s;&s;age to his People, he al|ways gave them &s;ome <HI>authentick Seal</HI> to evidence their Commi&s;&s;ion, when they were &s;ent to commu|nicate any <HI>new Revelation;</HI> tho' not always when they were &s;ent to inculcate <HI>former Revelations,</HI> that were already confirmed by undeniable Miracles.</P>
<P>And 'tis plain and evident they never bid Defi|ance to <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> as <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;ts</HI> are wont to do. For they &s;hew us that God challenges his People to rea|&s;on the Ca&s;e with him, even concerning the Mat|ter
<PB N="24" REF="005167_0022_1016CC48AC2306C8">of the Revelation of future Things. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 41.21, 22, 23.</P>
<P>But <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;ts</HI> &s;hew the greate&s;t Ill-Nature a|gain&s;t <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> and labour to per&s;wade Per&s;ons to be|lieve them upon their bare Word; and therefore have no good Foundation for their Faith to &s;tand up|on: For they lay as good a Foundation for the Faith of others as they build their own upon; which is re|ally none at all. But if you allow them to &s;tep over this Point of proving by Rea&s;on, that what they have is from God; then they are as glad as any to call in formerly de&s;pi&s;ed Rea&s;on to &s;upport even their wor&s;t Extravagances many Times. But where Rea|&s;on is mo&s;t of all needed, and where it might do them the mo&s;t Service, there they condemn and defy it. Therefore you will always find an <HI>Enthu|&s;ia&s;t,</HI> mo&s;t impatient of Contradiction in this Point, that the Work he admires and carries on is from God. Allow him but this Point without Proof, and <HI>rational Evidence,</HI> and he will be pretty ea&s;y with you, though you condemn many Things in him. For he has gained his main Point. And he knows that this once gained, all the re&s;t mu&s;t follow by natural Con&s;equence, whether you will or no. But if you hold him fa&s;t here, and be for Proof, he will only give you railing Accu&s;ation. For he has no rational Foundation at all, for his Faith to &s;tand on, and therefore denies its being di&s;puted. You mu&s;t believe as he &s;ays and that is enough: For he is always a <HI>Papi&s;t</HI> in this Point as well as many others.</P>
<P>And therefore an <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;t</HI> will have nothing to do with <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> in Matters of <HI>Faith,</HI> for Fear it &s;hould deceive him. And therefore can have no good Foundation for his Faith to &s;tand on.</P>
<P>And thus they thru&s;t them&s;elves into the bound|le&s;s Labyrinth of Deceit and Delu&s;ion, for Fear of being deceived by their old, mo&s;t kind, intimate,
<PB N="25" REF="005167_0023_1016CC4BABABCB58">and tender Friend <HI>Rea&s;on;</HI> which offers its kind A&s;|&s;i&s;tance to prevent their being deceived; but they refu&s;e it. And indeed without it they cannot take one Step right, nor one Moment keep from being deluded and deceived.</P>
<P>Thus did our fir&s;t Mother <HI>Eve,</HI> who fir&s;t of all took in the Poi&s;on of <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> which has infec|ted all her Seed ever &s;ince. She neglected to con|&s;ult <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> about the <HI>Revelation</HI> brought her by the <HI>Serpent.</HI> For had &s;he called in <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> to take Coun|&s;el withal, this might have prevented her being de|ceived; and thus her Progeny are prone to do e|ver &s;ince. Had &s;he &s;aid to the <HI>Serpent,</HI> Who &s;ent you upon this Di&s;covery? What <HI>authentick Seal,</HI> have you of Commi&s;&s;ion? How do I know you have any Commi&s;&s;ion from God, to make this Di&s;|covery, I have God's plain Word for it, that I may not eat of this Fruit; and mu&s;t I believe you upon your bare Word for it? Bring an authentic Seal of your Commi&s;&s;ion from God, or I have no Rea&s;on to regard you. I rely upon God forbidding me, and I dare not meddle with it, until I am &s;ure I have the &s;ame Word to give me Liberty; and then I know I may eat of it, as freely as any other Fruit of the Garden; but 'till then I mu&s;t and will forbear.</P>
<P>Had &s;he thus &s;ummoned her Rea&s;on to take Coun|&s;el within this Matter of Faith, it might have pre|vented her Ruin; but here &s;he failed. She belie|ved the Serpent without asking Coun&s;el of her Rea|&s;on. And by this Means &s;he infected her &s;elf, and all her Po&s;terity, with the &s;ame <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;tick</HI> Credu|lity, to any Thing that pretends to be <HI>divine;</HI> and to make them Partakers of that which is called <HI>&s;pi|ritual</HI> and <HI>divine.</HI></P>
<P>Though it be the proper Province of <HI>Faith,</HI> to receive divine Revelation of &s;piritual and divine Things; yet it is the proper Province of <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="005167_0024_1016CC4EDCF734F8">and in which Faith has nothing to do, to <HI>determine whether the Revelation be from God.</HI> For until this be fir&s;t known and determined by the <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>Under&s;tanding, Faith</HI> has nothing at all to do, nor can it begin upon any Foundation that will &s;tand, be|cau&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible without this to have any good Foundation. For if the Revelation or Di&s;covery be not divine, there can be no Rea&s;on to receive, and acquie&s;ce in it as &s;uch. Therefore this mu&s;t fir&s;t of all be determined by the Under&s;tanding and Rea&s;on: And then Faith's Province begins and not before. For if it might being before, it might receive a Lie for Truth; for an heavenly and di|vine Revelation, as our fir&s;t Mother <HI>Eve</HI> did, to the undoing her&s;elf and all her Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>I would gladly know of any Man, How it is po&s;|&s;ible to know that any Di&s;covery, or Revelation is from God, without the <HI>Evidence</HI> and <HI>Determination</HI> of <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>Under&s;tanding;</HI> I mu&s;t confe&s;s I cannot &s;ee how it is any Ways po&s;&s;ible for us to know it, to &s;ay that it may be &s;o, without &s;hewing how, can &s;atisfy none but a deluded Enthu&s;ia&s;t.</P>
<P>I can conceive how Fancy can imagine it to be divine, and be powerfully heated and moved by it, but this is very far from knowing it; though it is u&s;ually a Thou&s;and Times more &s;udden, and vio|lent, and more &s;uddenly produces vi&s;ible Effects, as it did in our fir&s;t Mother <HI>Eve.</HI> But when all is done, this does not prove it to be divine. For if <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> does not add its Te&s;timony, that it is di|vine it can be no more than a deluded Imagination.</P>
<P>This therefore is the Effect of this enthu&s;ia&s;tick Fire, that the Mind a&s;&s;ents to, or believes, its own warm Imaginations, for heavenly and divine Di&s;|coveries, and takes no Proofs of it, from the La|bours and Dictates of Rea&s;on: And therefore this lays the Foundation, for the wor&s;t of Errors and
<PB N="27" REF="005167_0025_1016CC519280FFE0">Delu&s;ions. For upon this Foundation nothing can be kept out, from being received for an heavenly and divine Di&s;covery. For I cannot &s;ee how it is po&s;&s;ible to prevent it in &s;uch Ca&s;e, but only by the immediate Interpo&s;ition of God him&s;elf, to re&s;tore &s;uch Per&s;ons to the right U&s;e of their Rea&s;on, and Under&s;tanding again, though they have de&s;pi&s;ed, and abu&s;ed it. Though God may very ju&s;tly in Judgment, leave &s;uch Per&s;ons to them&s;elves, and the Power of <HI>Satan</HI>'s Impre&s;&s;ions, and Impul&s;es, who have a Fondne&s;s to follow, and fall in with &s;uch Things, and no Que&s;tion he often does &s;o, when he permits <HI>Satan</HI> to advance <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> among a Peo|ple to try their Stedfa&s;tne&s;s in the Faith and Or|der of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Thus I have &s;hewed that Enthu&s;ia&s;m makes Men believe without a good Foundation, and their Beha|viour and Conduct is proportionable to their Faith.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>genuine Effect</HI> of <HI>Enthu&s;i|a&s;m,</HI> is a <HI>blind following of whatever Impre&s;&s;ion</HI> or <HI>Im|pul&s;e is made upon their Fancy,</HI> or <HI>Imagination,</HI> under the Notion of being <HI>&s;piritual.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Impul&s;e</HI> or <HI>Impre&s;&s;ion</HI> made there, always &s;eems to &s;uch Per&s;ons, to be &s;ome heavenly and divine Di&s;covery: Some Communication from, and Parti|cipation of the <HI>Holy Spirit.</HI> Something that lets them into the Secrets of Heaven; and di&s;covers to them either Truth or Duty.</P>
<P>And this is &s;o &s;trong, quick and powerful in ma|ny, that it hurries them on with Violence accord|ing to it; and they verily think 'tis all heavenly and divine; and therefore without making any Doubt, Scruple or Enquiry further into the Matter, by con&s;ulting their Rea&s;on and the Oracles of God, they blindly follow wherever this leads them. For to &s;end &s;uch to the Oracles of God to know whe|ther
<PB N="28" REF="005167_0026_1016CC53F1E61028">they are right, they think as ab&s;urd, as to &s;end a Man to the Sun at bright Noon-Day to know whether it be the Sun that he &s;ees; for they think 'tis what is contained in the Oracles of God that they &s;ee, and from this Fountain proceeds tho&s;e &s;trange and unaccountable Things, which are often to be &s;een among Enthu&s;ia&s;ts; which do &s;o often confound the Thoughts, even of wi&s;e Men about them. For &s;ometimes the Impre&s;&s;ions &s;eems vio|lently to carry them to that which is good, and a fair Face of Religion, at other Times &s;o confu&s;ed, and &s;o contrary to it, that even wi&s;e Men know not what to make of them: and are greatly &s;tum|bled about them; but it all proceeds from this Prin|ciple of <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> that is in them, according to the <HI>working of Satan,</HI> by &s;uch <HI>Signs and lying Wonders</HI> as the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> has it. 2 The&s;&s;. 2.9, 10. For the <HI>Man of Sin,</HI> has always come in, and gained his Power over a People, by <HI>&s;uch Signs</HI> and <HI>lying Wonders,</HI> as are produced by the <HI>powerful Impul&s;es of Enthu&s;ia&s;m;</HI> and therefore when a People &s;ee Multitudes of <HI>&s;uch Signs</HI> and <HI>lying Wonders</HI> among them they may ex|pect that the <HI>Man of Sin is but ju&s;t behind them.</HI></P>
<P>For the <HI>&s;ame Spirit</HI> that introduced <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> into our fir&s;t Mother <HI>Eve</HI> in <HI>Paradi&s;e,</HI> moves, and actuates them, and fills them with &s;uch powerful <HI>Impul&s;es,</HI> many Times to Things in them&s;elves good and carrying a Face, as though they were for the Advancement of Religion, and the Salvation of Souls, as he did when he deluded <HI>Eve:</HI> But all this is done the better to hide the Poi&s;on: For the <HI>great Enthu|&s;ia&s;m</HI> of the <HI>Man of Sin</HI> was and is brought in and propagated by this Means, and therefore 'tis called the <HI>My&s;tery of Iniquity,</HI> 2 The&s;&s;. 2.7. If Satan worketh his Wonders in an open bare faced Manner, and pro|claimed openly it was to bring them to wor&s;hip the Devil, it would be no My&s;tery at all. But his
<PB N="29" REF="005167_0027_1016CC56617552A8">Signs mu&s;t be <HI>lying, deceitful Wonders,</HI> and with the <HI>greate&s;t Pretence for the Glory and Honour of God, and Good of Souls,</HI> or his working would be no My|&s;tery at all. And therefore the Followers of <HI>Anti|chri&s;t,</HI> or <HI>Man of Sin</HI> are called <HI>My&s;tery, Babylon:</HI> Rev. 17.5&mdash;And they can by no Means keep up the <HI>My&s;tery of their Iniquity,</HI> but by Means of the <HI>powerful working of Satan,</HI> by the <HI>Signs</HI> and <HI>lying Wonders of Enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> produced by his &s;trong <HI>Im|pre&s;&s;ions,</HI> or <HI>Impul&s;es</HI> made upon enthu&s;ia&s;tic Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Enthu&s;ia&s;m is &s;uch a <HI>Proteus,</HI> that Satan can put it into all Manner of Shapes, to &s;erve his De&s;ign of deluding poor blind ignorant Mortals, and yet always make it appear with a mo&s;t zealous and re|ligious Face.</P>
<P>And as long as Satan can hold the Souls of Men fa&s;t, in believing &s;uch Impul&s;es, and powerful Im|pre&s;&s;ions upon their Minds, to be heavenly and di|vine Di&s;coveries, and keep them on acting accord|ing to them, and puff them up with &s;piritual Pride and Self-Conceit, as partaking of &s;piritual and di|vine Things above others, he cares not, for he keeps his <HI>Palace in Peace.</HI></P>
<P>And what have been all the Signs, and lying Wonders, whereby Satan hath brought in, and up|held the <HI>Man of Sin,</HI> but &s;uch <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;tick Impre&s;&s;i|ons,</HI> and <HI>Impul&s;es,</HI> and the <HI>Effects</HI> of them. By this Means be has, as it were, made <HI>Fire to come down from Heaven in the Sight</HI> or Apprehen&s;ion <HI>of Men.</HI> Rev. 13.13. i. e, he has filled their <HI>Imaginations</HI> and <HI>Fancies</HI> with <HI>dreadful Apprehen&s;ions of Fire coming down from God</HI> to con&s;ume them, and by this has fa&s;tened his Delu&s;ions in their Souls. The whole Hi&s;tory of that My&s;tery of Iniquity, gives us Ac|count of no other Fire, coming down from Heaven to fright them into his Delu&s;ions. And they look upon it truly miraculous, that he &s;hould thus all on
<PB N="30" REF="005167_0028_1016CC58CC75CDD8">a &s;udden Fright &s;uch great Numbers of Per&s;ons with &s;uch dreadful Apprehen&s;ions and conclude, therefore that it mu&s;t be from God. And the <HI>&s;ud|den</HI> and <HI>powerful Light</HI> with which he <HI>impre&s;&s;es their Souls, pre&s;ently after,</HI> is looked upon no le&s;s miracu|lous than the former, and therefore mu&s;t (they think) proceed from God.</P>
<P>And a Soul thus filled, and impre&s;&s;ed verily be|lieves 'tis all &s;piritual and divine: And goes on believ|ing, and blindly following &s;uch Impre&s;&s;ions, and Im|pul&s;es without any Doubt, Scruple, or Enquiry. 'Tis but to feel &s;uch Impre&s;&s;ions, or &s;weet Feelings (as they call them) and they follow it immediately.</P>
<P>To make any Doubt, Scruple or Enquiry, in &s;uch a plain Ca&s;e they think would be a great Di&s;honour to the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God; and a great Means to <HI>quench</HI> it. And they find by Experience that it does &s;o; for &s;uch a Spirit that makes the Impre&s;|&s;ion, and that &s;o &s;trongly influences them, cannot bear any Enquiries to be made into his Im|pre&s;&s;ions le&s;t he &s;hould be di&s;covered. For the &s;a|cred Scriptures, and true Rea&s;on are his mortal E|nemies; and to ask Coun&s;el of the&s;e two together quenches that Spirit, becau&s;e they are Coun&s;ellers &s;ent from Heaven, to di&s;cover the Blackne&s;s and Darkne&s;s of his De&s;igns: And no Wonder then that &s;uch a Spirit retires whenever the&s;e are called in to be con&s;ulted with, rather than be di&s;covered what he is.</P>
<P>If it were the <HI>Spirit of God</HI> that made the Impre&s;|&s;ion, he would never retire out of &s;uch Company: For the <HI>Spirit of God</HI> always &s;trongly moves Men to call in &s;uch Company, and to con&s;ult them on all Occa&s;ions, and never to &s;tir one Step forward with|out them. There are others indeed, though great Friends to Enthu&s;ia&s;m, and feel it pretty &s;trongly working in their Souls, yet arrive not to this Pitch;
<PB N="31" REF="005167_0029_1016CC5A74068AE0">and are ready to &s;tart and be affrighted at any &s;trong Impul&s;e made upon their Minds: and fall immedi|ately to enquiring and examining all by Scripture and true Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>The&s;e therefore the Tempter mu&s;t u&s;e gently, or they will prove his wor&s;t Enemies in this De&s;ign. And therefore he is &s;paring of making any &s;uch &s;trong Impul&s;es, or Impre&s;&s;ions there, with Violence. The&s;e therefore he moves in a more gentle, &s;oft and ea&s;y Manner. The&s;e he per&s;wades to think, that there are only &s;ome few wild almo&s;t di&s;tracted Per&s;ons that have &s;uch &s;trong Impul&s;es. Yet &s;uch Per&s;ons are no le&s;s led away, by the Power of En|thu&s;ia&s;m than the other, tho' in a &s;afer and ea&s;ier Way.</P>
<P>But the&s;e <HI>Impul&s;es</HI> or <HI>violent &s;trong Impre&s;&s;ions,</HI> made upon their Fancies or Imaginations; have &s;o many <HI>wonderful Effects</HI> both upon the <HI>Body</HI> and <HI>Mind</HI> that it is almo&s;t incredible, e&s;pecially to &s;uch as never &s;aw or heard them, viz. &s;uch as <HI>dreadful Frights extatick Joys, violent &amp; &s;trange Motions of the Body, and the Voice, fainting Fits, Convul&s;ions,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>All which if you trace the Hi&s;tory of Enthu&s;ia&s;m from the Beginning of the World down to our Day, both among the <HI>Heathen,</HI> and the <HI>People of God,</HI> have in a greater or le&s;&s;er Degree, always attended En|thu&s;ia&s;m, and where any Thing of this Nature is to be &s;een among tho&s;e who are under the <HI>powerful Operation</HI> of the <HI>Spirit of God;</HI> they are all owing to a greater or le&s;&s;er Degree of <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> by which <HI>Satan</HI> would overthrow the good Effects of the <HI>Spirit's</HI> Operation.</P>
<P N="4">4. Another <HI>Effect</HI> of <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> is great and <HI>&s;ud|den Joy</HI> without and <HI>good Foundation.</HI></P>
<P>The Joys and Comforts attending Enthu&s;ia&s;m are for the mo&s;t Part if not always &s;udden, and violent at their fir&s;t Appearance; and for the mo&s;t Part &s;o
<PB N="32" REF="005167_0030_1016CC5C2475B998">by Fits afterwards. Whereas that which ari&s;es from the Influence of the Spirit of God, is u&s;ually more gradual; intermixed for the mo&s;t Part with holy Fear, and Jealou&s;y over them&s;elves, and always pro|ceeds upon Foundations of Rea&s;on and Under&s;tand|ing, and never without the mo&s;t bright and clear Exerci&s;e of Rea&s;on, Under&s;tanding and Judgment.</P>
<P>But the Joys and Comforts attending Enthu&s;ia&s;m are &s;udden, great, and violent, even &s;o as many Times to <HI>overpower the Body</HI> in a great Degree, and in a Manner wholly to de&s;troy the <HI>Exerci&s;e of Rea|&s;on.</HI> And therefore an Enthu&s;ia&s;t can &s;eldom give a better Account of it, than that they <HI>&s;ee</HI> and <HI>feel</HI> great Light and Comfort in their Souls, which ravi&s;hes them with Joy. They &s;ee &s;uch &s;piritual and heavenly Sights, that they <HI>feel</HI> the mo&s;t won|derful Joy &s;preading along their Souls; and they think they are &s;ure all this is from the <HI>Spirit of God.</HI> They can't give a <HI>rational</HI> Account what this Light was, nor how it came into their Minds, nor upon what <HI>rational</HI> Foundation it &s;tands. But only can &s;ay they had great Light let into their Souls; they <HI>&s;aw God and Chri&s;t,</HI> and this has filled them with in|expre&s;&s;ible Joy.</P>
<P>They can't di&s;tingui&s;h this Light from imaginary &s;eeing and feeling.</P>
<P>They can't trace the Beginnings of it from a <HI>rational</HI> free Act of their Souls accepting, and em|bracing <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> according to the Offers made in the Go&s;pel: But it all begins upon this great Light im|pre&s;&s;ed upon their Imaginations, and therefore has no good Foundation to &s;tand upon. For ask them what this Light was, and they can't tell you in any rational Manner.</P>
<P>For what true Light in the Soul is, they are utter Strangers to. For this can be no more than the clear Evidence of the Truth and Goodne&s;s of the Go&s;|pel,
<PB N="33" REF="005167_0031_1016CC5F569864B0">as a Revelation from God. A clear Under|&s;tanding and Conviction of this from &s;olid Rea&s;ons, is true Light in the Soul; and when the Spirit of God gives this it fully per&s;wades the Soul to accept the Offers made therein, and to live and act accor|ding thereunto. And thus they become true and real Chri&s;tians and evangelically conformed to the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us. And a &s;olid rational Joy, Comfort, and Satisfaction is by the Spirit of God rai&s;ed in the Soul hereupon.</P>
<P N="5">5. Another genuine <HI>Fruit</HI> and <HI>Effect</HI> of <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> is a <HI>great Contempt of all but them&s;elves</HI> or tho&s;e that are <HI>like them.</HI></P>
<P>They value not high nor low rich nor poor, or any Per&s;on whatever, but &s;uch as entertain, or are favourable to their Enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>This, and this alone can make them think well of any Per&s;on. As to all others, though never &s;o wi&s;e, and good, and though they have given the brighte&s;t Evidence of their true Piety, by an holy, wi&s;e heavenly and unblemi&s;hed Conver&s;ation; yet all this pa&s;&s;es for nothing at all with an Enthu&s;ia&s;t.</P>
<P>He rather deems this a Sign of their <HI>Hypocri&s;y,</HI> than of their true Piety, if they give not into his Enthu&s;ia&s;m. He can readily and freely pa&s;s Sen|tence of Condemnation upon all &s;uch, and &s;end them to Hell: And as freely &s;entence &s;uch to Hea|ven as live in Drunkenne&s;s, Whoredom, Lying, Cheating, Deceiving, Envy, Contention and Stri&s;e, if they are but warm Enthu&s;ia&s;ts.</P>
<P>They can hardly be neighbourly or peaceable, with any that are not Enthu&s;ia&s;ts like them&s;elves, or &s;uch as &s;avour it.</P>
<P>This with them is the only Mark, and di&s;tin|gui&s;hing Character of a true Child of God. If they &s;ee any with this Mark, which they di&s;cover by their Looks, and Words (for the mo&s;t Part) they
<PB N="34" REF="005167_0032_1016CC626E448738">at once pronounce &s;uch an one a true Child of God, and Heir of Heaven; without knowing any Thing more about them; yea thought &s;uch have a thou&s;and plain Marks of Satan's Image upon them. And they are as &s;evere in their Reflections upon all others that have not this Mark, as they are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> kind to &s;uch as have. For they at once &s;end them to Hell, though they have never &s;o many true Scripture Marks of the Children of God; if they di&s;like their Enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>They de&s;pi&s;e them; and can bear no Rea&s;on|ings from them to convince them of their Er|rors and Mi&s;takes. They look upon them&s;elves to have engro&s;&s;ed all that's &s;piritual and divine, and that all others that have never &s;een this great ima|ginary Light, nor felt the Heat of this &s;trong ima|ginary Fire; are all Reprobates, and Oppo&s;ers of God's Work, and de&s;erve no better Sentence than Damnation. And therefore &s;how a &s;upercilious Con|tempt of them.</P>
<P>This indeed is not the Ca&s;e of all of them, for &s;ome are much more moderate, and rea&s;onable than others are. But yet this is the true Temper of the Spirit of Enthu&s;ia&s;m; tho' it appears mo&s;t when blown up into a great Flame. But I &s;hall mention but one more.</P>
<P N="6">6. And that is a <HI>fiery Spirit of Per&s;ecution, again&s;t all that differ from them,</HI> as far as they have Power.</P>
<P>Indeed when Enthu&s;ia&s;m fir&s;t begins to &s;how it &s;elf; it pretends to all <HI>Meekne&s;s, Patience, Quiet|ne&s;s and Love.</HI></P>
<P>They would not do any Thing for all the World, to hurt another for his Opinion and Judgment. If he be wrong they would do not more than pity, in&s;truct, and pray for him. And thus Enthu&s;ia&s;m would be thought, to be the true Go&s;pel Spirit.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="005167_0033_1016CC650CAF6020">
But as &s;oon as great Numbers are added, it &s;oon puts on another Face; e&s;pecially, when there is Hopes of their being the &s;tronge&s;t Party. Then they begin to tran&s;gre&s;s <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Regularity</HI> in <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>State,</HI> and pretend <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> for &s;o do|ing: And that nothing is <HI>Order</HI> but their <HI>own Francies</HI> and <HI>Imaginations.</HI> They begin then to be <HI>loud</HI> and <HI>boi&s;terous,</HI> and <HI>threaten</HI> what they will do; and begin <HI>boldly to trample upon Authority,</HI> in <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>State,</HI> and are not afraid to <HI>&s;peak evil of Digni|ties,</HI> Jude 8.

<P>It ever has been &s;o with Enthu&s;ia&s;m: Witne&s;s the Enthu&s;ia&s;m of <HI>Jeroboam</HI> among the <HI>ten Tribes;</HI> and the Enthu&s;ia&s;m of <HI>Mahomet</HI> in <HI>Turkey;</HI> and a|bove all that of the <HI>Pope</HI> or <HI>Antichri&s;t,</HI> which has prevailed about a Thou&s;and Years. What a vio|lent hot <HI>per&s;ecuting Spirit</HI> does it &s;how towards all that differ from it; wherever it can gain the Pow|er, i. e. upon all &s;uch as they call Oppo&s;ers.</P>
<P>This Spirit ever did and ever will attend Enthu|&s;ia&s;m, wherever it gains the Power over others. For nothing better can be expected from that Spi|rit
<PB N="36" REF="005167_0034_1016CC66EBE57510">which judges and pa&s;&s;es Sentence upon Men, and &s;ends them to Hell, that de&s;pi&s;es Rea&s;on, and &s;ets up Faith without it. Nothing better can be expected from that Spirit that &s;hews <HI>&s;o much En|mity</HI> to all others that differ from them. As to call them <HI>Dogs, Devils</HI> and <HI>&s;entences them to Hell:</HI> Such want nothing but Power, and they would execute their Sentence &s;peedily to the full. This is mo&s;t certainly the true Spirit of Enthu&s;ia&s;m, tho' Multitudes are ready to follow it with Eagerne&s;s.</P>
<P>Thus I have endeavoured to trace <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> from its <HI>Origin</HI> to the <HI>End</HI> of it as to this World. And from what has been &s;aid concerning it, we may &s;ee that the Nature of it is, to make Per|&s;ons compa&s;s them&s;elves about with <HI>Sparks of their own kindling,</HI> and to <HI>walk in the Light of his own Fire,</HI> as the <HI>Prophet</HI> &s;peaks, I&s;ai. 50.11. Who&s;e Words &s;hew that Enthu&s;ia&s;m prevailed in his Day. When a People grow corrupt in their Practi&s;es, they &s;oon come to that Pa&s;s, as not to be willing to bear <HI>&s;ound Doctrine;</HI> and then by the ju&s;t Judgment of God upon them, they are ready to be filled with Enthu&s;ia&s;m, and then <HI>heap to them&s;elves Teachers having itching Ears.</HI> 2 Tim. 4.3. And then they do at lea&s;t vertually <HI>&s;ay to the Prophets, prophe&s;y to us &s;mooth Things,</HI> I&s;ai. 30.10. They love &s;uch Teachers, as bring them &s;uch Doctrines, as &s;uddenly pa&s;s them for godly Men, and &s;latter, and &s;ooth their Pride and Self-Conceit, and thereby <HI>&s;ew Pillows under their Arm|Holes, and daub them with untempered Mortar.</HI> Jer. 5.31. Micah 2.11. Ezek. 13.18, &amp;c. And there is nothing &s;o effectual as Enthu&s;ia&s;m to do this, and therefore nothing that a corrupt People are &s;o &s;oon carried away with as this, becau&s;e it always pretends to the mo&s;t quick, and ea&s;y Way to make &s;ure of Heaven.</P>

And although it fills the Soul with <HI>great Dark|ne&s;s,</HI> as our <HI>Saviour</HI> &s;peaks of it, Matth. 6.23. Yet how great a Degree of it may con&s;i&s;t with <HI>true Faith</HI> in Chri&s;t, and true Humility of Mind, and true Love to God, is not very ea&s;y to de|termine. But this I am fully per&s;waded of, that as 'tis acknowledged by all but hot Enthu&s;ia&s;ts that there remains &s;till &s;ome of the <HI>Old-Man</HI> in the be&s;t of Saints, i. e. &s;ome &s;inful corrupt In|clinations and De&s;ires while in this Life; &s;o am I &s;atisfied that godly Men, (&s;ome more than o|thers) are many Times filled with con&s;iderable Degrees of <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m:</HI> And for a Man to de|termine preci&s;ely, what Degree of it is incon&s;i&s;|tent with true Piety, I think is very difficult; and how far the kind Author of our Beings, who knows our Darkne&s;s, Infirmities, and Mi&s;takes, may pardon and overlook them, in and through Chri&s;t, where he &s;ees an hone&s;t, &s;incere, and up|right Heart, I think is too much Boldne&s;s to de|termine.</P>
<P>Yet am I not in the lea&s;t the better plea&s;ed with it becau&s;e of this, but look upon it, as the Remainders of <HI>Original Sin</HI> in the Godly. And therefore look upon my &s;elf bound to pity and pray for &s;uch as are overtaken with it, and with the &s;ame Spirit of Meekne&s;s, and Chri&s;tian Ten|derne&s;s to re&s;tore &s;uch, as I am tho&s;e that are over|taken in any other Sin.</P>
