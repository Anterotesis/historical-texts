<P>An an&s;wer however to the <HI>Centinel</HI> was forborne, that no inter|ruption might be given on the part of the Church to any union of councils that might be thought nece&s;&s;ary in the pre&s;ent cri&s;is.

<PB N="11" REF="011212_0006_0F862CE5B2379358">it.&mdash;Who&s;e applications for American Bi&s;hops have ever been preludes to attempts on Liberty; that &s;uch was their application during the odious Stamp-act, and the like in the end of Queen Ann's reign, when an open rebellion, the introduction of the Pretender, the revival of Popery in England, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of Bi&s;hops in America, were all projected toge|ther,</Q> &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>All the&s;e charges are to be found in the Centinel and a writer to whom the Centinel can be no &s;tranger, even goes farther and charges the <HI>Church</HI> roundly with taking off King Charles's head.</P>
<P>If one a&s;ks the rea&s;on of this &s;hameful attack on the Church? It is an&s;wered by another que&s;tion&mdash;who was the aggre&s;&s;or? Why did Dr. Chandler begin? But is Dr. Chandler the Church of England, or the ten thou&s;andth part of it? or had he any general commi&s;&s;ion from that <HI>Church,</HI> or even from his own brethren belonging to it in America? This is not pretended; and it is certain, that no more than half a dozen of them ever had an opportunity of &s;eeing his pamphlet till in print, and of that number, it is confidently &s;aid, not one to the &s;outh of De|laware.</P>
<P>If Dr. Chandler has &s;aid any thing wrong (and what writer claims ab&s;olute perfection?) he &s;hould be an&s;wered as Dr. Chandler, and &s;et right in the &s;ame mildne&s;s, that he him&s;elf hath given an example of. Is it fair to attack the whole Church; its doctrine, di&s;cipline and con&s;titution, on account of the wri|tings of any &s;ingle member? Would the Pre&s;byterians think this fair in any ca&s;e of their own? As for example, <HI>Si parvis magna componere licet,</HI> the <HI>venerable</HI> JOHN CARMICHAEL, the great advocate of the <HI>venerable</HI> Synod of New-York and Phila|delphia has declared that he never <Q>knew that <HI>venerable</HI> body, in <HI>any in&s;tance,</HI> act below their <HI>venerable</HI> character of amba&s;&s;adors of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; that they are up|wards of an hundred <HI>gentlemen-clergy,</HI> all reputable and learn|ed gentlemen; that they keep an exact hi&s;tory of their tran&s;|actions, which is to be finally revi&s;ed by an almighty, omni&s;ci|ent, impartial, and mo&s;t righteous judge.</Q></P>
<P>Should any one conclude from tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions (which might be done without much violence to their &s;en&s;e) that <HI>John</HI> main|tains the INFALLIBILITY of the <HI>venerable Synod,</HI> and thinks their minutes fit for God Almighty's own revi&s;al; and &s;hould further contend that the <HI>&s;lapda&s;h</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>An expre&s;&s;ion which</HI> John <HI>has &s;ometimes u&s;ed in his preach|ments.</HI></NOTE> doctrines of <HI>John</HI> were the doctrines of the whole Pre&s;byterian <HI>Kirk,</HI> which was therefore to be deemed a ranting enthu&s;ia&s;tick <HI>Kirk,</HI> a rotten <HI>Kirk,</HI> a

<P>And yet in the &s;ame way has the Church of England been treated on account of Dr. Chandler, who neverthele&s;s &s;eems to have given no provocation for it, nor uttered a &s;ingle word reflecting on the principles of any prote&s;tant denomination. If then Dr. Chandler had been the aggre&s;&s;or, (the contrary of which &s;hall be &s;hewn) if even he had advanced any thing indefen&s;ible on the principles of law, liberty, equity and the Chri&s;tian reve|lation, would this ju&s;tify the torrent of abu&s;e and calumny which is poured forth on the Church in an&s;wer to <HI>him?</HI></P>
<P>The de&s;ign of the&s;e papers, however, is not the defence of Dr. Chandler; who, if he needs any, is &s;ufficient for that office him&s;elf. They have a nobler purpo&s;e in view&mdash;the defence of our national Church&mdash;of the religion of our &s;overeign, and of the far greate&s;t, and, may I be allowed to &s;ay, the mo&s;t re|&s;pectable part of his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>In pro&s;ecuting this de&s;ign, (though the Centinel has ob&s;erved no certain method) I think it nece&s;&s;ary to fix &s;ome plan for my an&s;wer; and &s;hall therefore fir&s;t &s;hew that Dr. Chandler, far from being an aggre&s;&s;or, is only a defendant in a di&s;pute which was commenced on the part of the antagoni&s;ts of the Church in New-England as early as 1734; from which time their repeated attacks &s;hall be traced down to the publication of Dr. Chandler's pamphlet.</P>
<P>It is then propo&s;ed to enter the li&s;ts with the Centinel and to &s;hew that in the character of the Bi&s;hop, which he and his a&s;&s;oci|ates have drawn, they have been combating a phantom of their own brain; that their true de&s;ign is evidently to oppre&s;s and bear down the Church for the &s;ake of an empire of their own, that they have nothing to do with that mode of government and di&s;cipline which Epi&s;copalians choo&s;e for them&s;elves, unle&s;s they could at lea&s;t &s;hew &s;ome probability of its interfering with the rights of others; that of whatever origin epi&s;copal government is, whether <HI>humane</HI> or <HI>divine</HI> it is that which many wi&s;e men have preferred, and probably ever will prefer to the motely go|vernment of Pre&s;bytery, which is not indeed the tyranny of <HI>One,</HI> but too often the tyranny and ab&s;urdity of many; and la&s;tly that if the civil and religious liberty of America is ever likely to be in danger from any religious per&s;ua&s;ion here, it is not from the CHUF<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">H, but from a re&s;tle&s;s and a&s;piring party, who are giving too con&s;tant and melancholy proofs of the mo&s;t <HI>intolerant</HI> and over bearing &s;pirit.</P>

I know many among their laity, &s;ome even among their clergy, who are real friends to the liberties of their country and of mankind, and adorned with a truly Catholic and for|bearing &s;pirit.

The &s;teps that they have lately pur&s;ued in America, compared with their conduct in former times, when in the pur&s;uit of empire in the Mother Country, give but too much ground for this &s;u&s;picion.

<P>IN the former number of this paper, it was ob&s;erved that the common apology made by the Centinel's friends, for the un|manly and illiberal manner in which he has abu&s;ed and calumi|nated the Church, is, that Dr. Chandler, by the publication of his pamphlet, in favour of an American epi&s;copacy, was the ag|gre&s;&s;or.&mdash;The futility of this apology hath been fully &s;hewn.&mdash; Dr. Chandler made no attack on the principles of any prote&s;tant per&s;ua&s;ion, and therefore nothing done by him could ju&s;tify an attack on the church in general&mdash;No way then can Dr. Chand|ler's publication ju&s;tify the Centinel, unle&s;s he can &s;hew it to be a crime for a member of the church of England to contend for tho&s;e rights and privileges, which he con&s;iders as e&s;&s;ential to the being of a church&mdash;But the Centinel probably judges that all power and privileges in America are the property of his own par|ty as the ELECT; and that it is a daring attack upon their pre|rogative, for any other church to claim even a being, much le&s;s a well-being, in the &s;ame land with them.&mdash;However, let this be, or not be, the &s;entiments of the Centinel, certain it is, that the pre&s;byterians and independents of New-England have ever
<PB N="15" REF="011212_0008_0F862CE723DCE880">looked upon that country as a kind of Deodand, or godly heri|tage, derived to them from Heaven; and to which none but them&s;elves have right or claim&mdash;"We hold our lands" (&s;ays a Bo&s;ton Almanack, for the year 1763) "under no other Lord, but he who gave Canaan to Abraham."

<P>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with this notion (namely that God and nature de&s;ign|ed New-England as the &s;ole property and inheritance of the &s;aints) they have always con&s;idered tho&s;e among them, who &s;aid their prayers in a different manner from them&s;elves, "As &s;pies come to &s;ee the good land," or as intruders into their new Ca|naan, their land of promi&s;e. And under this notion it was, that "they hanged up unto the Lord" in Bo&s;ton &s;o many Quakers; And for above half a century have pur&s;ued with gro&s;&s;e&s;t calumny and abu&s;e, a venerable and truly charitable &s;ociety

<P>I proceed therefore to &s;hew who have been the aggre&s;&s;ors, and who the defendants, in this cau&s;e; and, for the pre&s;ent, need go no farther back than the year 1734.</P>
<P>In that year we find the pre&s;byterians and independents afore|&s;aid ba&s;ely attacking the church, vilifying her clergy in language which all the other writers of that party, down to our magnani|mous Centinel, &s;eem only to have copied.&mdash;We find them likewi&s;e claiming an e&s;tabli&s;hment and empire for them&s;elves; loudly complaining that epi&s;copalians &s;hould be &s;uffered to ap|proach the Holy Land, or come among them to lay blocks in the way of their church power; and therefore they boldly addre&s;s the Bi&s;hop of London to &s;end the epi&s;copal mi&s;&s;ionaries back among the &s;avages, or to &s;ome other part of America.</P>
<P>Both the addre&s;s and an&s;wers being curious, and greatly tend|ing to &s;hew the early de&s;igns of this party for power and domini|on, and their intolerant uncharitable &s;pirit, I &s;hall give the ne|ce&s;&s;ary extracts from them.</P>

<P>Now, what is it the&s;e pious men want his lord&s;hip's goodne&s;s to judge in?

<P><Q>The mi&s;&s;ionaries are neither nece&s;&s;ary or profitable, but as to many in&s;tances injurious to the intere&s;t of the kingdom of Chri&s;t, and the good of his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects.</Q></P>

<P>In an&s;wer to their claim of an e&s;tabli&s;hment, or exclu&s;ive right to the country, his lord&s;hip writes,</P>
<P><Q>I need not de&s;cend to particulars, becau&s;e you will clearly &s;ee the &s;entiments of the &s;ociety in their an&s;wer to the mi|ni&s;ters.&mdash;But my opinion has always been, that the religious &s;tate of New-England is founded in an equal liberty to all pro|te&s;tants, none of whom can claim the name of a national e&s;tabli&s;hment, nor any kind of &s;uperiority over the re&s;t; and that therefore every in&s;tance, in which either mini&s;ters or peo|ple take upon them to act as if they were a national e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, is a violation of the charter, the adhering to which as a rule to all, is, in my opinion, the only &s;ure foundation of peace and love among the &s;everal denominations or profe&s;&s;ions, who have an equal right to the benefit of it.&mdash;I am aware, that acts of a&s;&s;embly have pa&s;&s;ed in New-England, which &s;eem to favour the notion that one denomination of prote&s;tants is the e&s;tabli&s;hed church there.&mdash;And &s;ome of tho&s;e acts may have obtained a confirmation here, for want of a due atten|tion to the charter, and to the con&s;equences of them, with regard to the other denominations: But a doubt may be rai&s;ed, with re&s;pect to the validity of them, &s;o far as they &s;hall be found contrary to the tenor of the charter: And be&s;ides, a national church, and the independent way, are things which the bi&s;hops and clergy here know not how to reconcile.</Q></P>

<P>All the&s;e things, Mr. Anatomi&s;t, and much more, you mu&s;t take into your plan, if you expect to complete your work.

<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>They are chiefly collected from modern hi&s;tory, Vol.</HI> 6.</NOTE> ju&s;t at hand, I convey them to you for the&s;e purpo&s;es. I begin then with the introduction of independency into New-England in the year 62<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; but fir&s;t, let me &s;ay &s;omething of its origin. The independents, known at fir&s;t by the name of Browni&s;ts, from one Robert Brown, their &s;ounder or leader, "were the very wor&s;t and mo&s;t trouble&s;ome of all the Engli&s;h &s;ectaries. By the rebellious principles they taught, they rendered them&s;elves &s;o obnoxious to the government, that they thought fit to tran&s;port them&s;elves to Am&s;terdam, where they &s;oon began to differ among them&s;elves, and crumble into &s;o many parties, that Mr. Brown grew weary of his office; and r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing to England, renounced his principles of &s;eparation, and was preferred to the rectory of a church in Northampton&s;hire.</P>
<P>This revolt of Brown was attended with almo&s;t the total di&s;&s;olu|tion of his church; but part of the &s;cattered flock being collected by Mr. John Robin&s;on, one of their preachers, they removed with him to Leyden about the year 1610. Here they remained 7 years, but at length, the Dutch either grew weary of them, or they grew weary of the Dutch, for they complained of having &s;uffered very great hard&s;hips among them, declaring that impri|&s;onment in England was preferable to the condition of refugees in Holland, whereupon many of them actually returned to En|gland. Robin&s;on and his elders apprehending a general de&s;er|tion, hit upon this expedient to keep them together, and increa&s;e their numbers: They repre&s;ented that New-England was not only a place that abounded with all things de&s;irable in life, but that there were great expectations of di&s;covering trea&s;ures equal to tho&s;e of Mexico or Peru, and that there they might be|come the founders of &s;ome mighty &s;tate. Such a promi&s;ing &s;cheme could not fail of having the de&s;ired effect; the adventurers therefore &s;et them&s;elves to work to purcha&s;e a territory in New-England of the Plymouth Company, and to obtain a patent from the crown. The motives made u&s;e of at court to obtain this patent were, the glorious pretence of propagating the Chri&s;tian religion among infidets: the extending his Maje&s;ty's dominions; enriching their mother country; and preventing both the French and Dutch from po&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing them&s;elves of this de|&s;irable country. All things being at la&s;t agreed on, our Brown|i&s;ts, alias Independents, embarked at Delft in Holland, in July 1620, and arrived at Cape Cod in New-England on the 19th of
<PB N="24" REF="011212_0013_0F862CEDEC2160E8">November following. As &s;oon as they got footing on &s;hore, they determined to have no regard to the patents they had obtained from the crown, but to elect a governor, and &s;trike out &s;uch a form of government as be&s;t &s;uited their de&s;igns. Having there|fore formed an a&s;&s;ociation, and agreed to &s;ubmit to &s;uch laws as &s;hould be approved by a majority, they dre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> up and &s;igned an in&s;trument to that effect; and then elected Mr. John Carver for their governor.</P>
<P>Soon after this, Mr. We&s;ton, a merchant, came over with a number of pa&s;&s;engers, in order to form a &s;ettlement, and accord|ingly &s;at down at a place called We&s;agu&s;qua&s;et, afterwards Weymouth; but unfortunately for Mr. We&s;ton and his people they happened to be members of the church of England, and being therefore looked upon with an evil eye by the independ|ents, and abandoned to the fury of the &s;avages, they were o|bliged to quit their &s;ettlement, with the following character from their pious and godly neighbou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, <Q>We&s;ton and his men were &s;o &s;candalou&s;ly wicked, that they were a nu&s;ance to the very &s;avages.</Q></P>
<P>Soon after this, Capt. Gorges came over with &s;everal families, and Mr. Murres, a mini&s;ter, all of the epi&s;copal per&s;ua&s;ion, with a de&s;ign to re&s;tore the &s;ettlement We&s;ton had quitted; but this gentleman al&s;o finding how obnoxious he was to the Saints, returned to England, and &s;ays the puritanical hi&s;torian "his bi&s;h|op followed him."</P>
<P>The company in a little time after, &s;ent over Mr. Lyford as chaplain in the Plymouth colony, who being an epi&s;copalian, would have performed divine &s;ervice and admini&s;tered the &s;acra|ments after the manner of the church of England; but the plan|ters compelled him to conform him&s;elf to their way of wor&s;hip, and at la&s;t drove him fairly off.</P>
<P>Some of the planters however, being con&s;cientious churchmen, and finding that they could have no mini&s;ters of their own, &s;et up an a&s;&s;embly, wherein they u&s;ed the liturgy of the church of Eng|land; and of the&s;e Mr Samuel Brown, a lawyer, and his bro|ther John Brown, a merchant, men of e&s;tates and figure, were the chief, being of the number of the fir&s;t patentees. The depu|ty governor &s;ending to the&s;e gentlemen to demand the rea&s;on of their &s;eparation, they repre&s;ented, that as they were of the church e&s;tabli&s;hed by law in their native country, it was highly rea&s;on|able they &s;hould wor&s;hip God in the manner that government re|quired from which they received their charter; at lea&s;t they ought to allow the members of the church that liberty of con&s;cience they them&s;elves thought &s;o rea&s;onable when they were on the other &s;ide of the water; and as one article in their charter pro|vided that all per&s;ua&s;ions of Chri&s;tians &s;hould have liberty of con|con&s;cience,
<PB N="25" REF="011212_0013_0F862CEDEC2160E8">they did not know whether their denying it to them was not a forfeiture of their charter.

<P>About the year 1630, one Mr. <HI>Black&s;tone,</HI> an <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> mini&s;ter, built a little hou&s;e oppo&s;ite to <HI>Charles Town,</HI> by virtue whereof he laid claim to the whole Penin&s;ula, but the inhabi|tants of this town ob&s;erving that the <HI>par&s;on</HI>'s &s;ituation was pre|ferable to their own, they immediately di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him, and ju&s;tified the outrage by &s;ugge&s;ting that Mr. <HI>Black&s;tone was an odd &s;ort of a man, who would not join him&s;elf with any of their New England churches;</HI> and when they had driven away this <HI>odd &s;ort of a man,</HI> they laid the foundation of their capital city upon this very &s;pot of ground, to which they gave the name of <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI>"</P>
<P>Having thus &s;ilenced or bani&s;hed the <HI>Epi&s;copalians,</HI> they then fell foul of one another, and divided into two factions, the one zealous for the <HI>covenant of works,</HI> and the other for the <HI>cove|nant of grace.</HI> For as the witty <HI>Butler</HI> ob&s;erves,

<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><P>As in various in&s;tances you have given undoubted evidence of your impartiality; particularly by your giving a place not only to the American Whig and Penn&s;ylvania Centinel, but al&s;o to the Anatomi&s;t; I hope therefore; you will in&s;ert the following in your very u&s;eful paper, which will oblige more than your friend</P>
<BIBL><HI>IRENICUS.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE God of Truth has informed us, that a <HI>kingdom di|vided again&s;t it&s;elf cannot &s;tand;</HI> and that &s;uch as <HI>bite and devour one another, will be de&s;troyed one of another.</HI> And the evidences we have in every age of the truth of the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions, mu&s;t oblige all to grant, that <HI>the &s;trength of a people depends on their harmony in &s;entiment and conduct.</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e therefore who &s;tudy to promote truth and concord among men, ought to be con&s;idered as their true friends; where|as &s;uch as endeavour to divide, and &s;tir up contentions, may ju&s;tly be deemed their enemies and de&s;troyers. How affecting is it then that mea&s;ures of this de&s;tructive nature are pur&s;ued by any among us? As I learn from a late paper, there are, by one who &s;tiles him&s;elf the Anatomi&s;t. As for the Centinel whom he attacks, the American Whig, or yet Dr. Chandler, I know little of them; having read but a few paragraphs in any one, and not &s;een the others, and therefore cannot be a judge of what they have &s;aid. Nor is it my de&s;ign to vindicate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he Centinel; &s;hould that be requi&s;ite, it belongs to him&s;elf. But I am in|formed that Dr, Chandler rai&s;ed the debate, at this time, in the&s;e middle provinces, and publickly in&s;i&s;ted for an an&s;wer. And if the Centinel has given one, and therein attacked the Church of England, this is not to be imputed to the Pre&s;byteri|an or Independent Church, as the Anatomi&s;t does, had the Centinel gone ever &s;o far wrong. <HI>For</HI> (to u&s;e the Anatomi&s;t's own way of rea&s;oning, which in this appears ju&s;t) <HI>is the Centi|nel the Independent, or yet the Pre&s;byterian Church? or the ten thou&s;andth part of either of them?</HI> Or had he any <HI>general com|mi&s;&s;ion from the&s;e Churches;</HI> or a commi&s;&s;ion <HI>from any in them? That is not pretended. It does not appear that</HI> &s;o much as one,
<PB N="28" REF="011212_0015_0F862CEF6405F068">much le&s;s that <HI>half a dozen, ever had the &s;ight of the Centinel's pieces till in print. If the Continel has &s;aid any thing wrong, (and what writer claims ab&s;olute per&s;ection) he &s;hould be an|&s;wered as the Centinel, and &s;et right. Is it fair to attack the whole Church on account of the writings of any &s;ingle per&s;on? Would the Epi&s;copalians think this fair in any ca&s;e of their own?</HI> How unfairly then does the Anatomi&s;t act (him&s;elf being judge) who (when &s;peaking of the Church of England) &s;ays, <Q>it has been ba&s;ely vilified and traduced, by an a&s;piring over-bearing party,</Q> (referring to the Pre&s;byterians) and that <Q>if they were con&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves, and really believed what they have printed, they ought to be covered with confu&s;ion to &s;olicit either union or communion, in any matter what&s;oe|ver, with the members of a Church which their Centinel and his adherents have painted in the following odious charac|ters.</Q> And then, he mentions various charges again&s;t the Church of England, which he &s;ays are to be found in the Cen|tinel. And having found the&s;e in one who calls him&s;elf the Penn&s;ylvania Centinel, (whether a Pre&s;byterian or not I cannot tell) he goes on to repre&s;ent the Pre&s;byterian &s;ociety in a very &s;hocking light indeed; is no way &s;paring of the ba&s;e&s;t charac|ters, which, it &s;eems, come readier to him than arguments. He even in&s;inuates, that they are at la&s;t begun to plot &s;ome horrible things; and that the civil and religious liberty of America is in danger from them; with abundance of the like. In his vi&s;ions he is even carried into the field of battle; and talks of re&s;i&s;ting unto blood! 'Tis to be hoped that Presbyte|rians will not &s;urmi&s;e that &s;uch &s;currility and unmannerly treatment is approved of by any &s;ober Churchmen. It cannot. Hi&s;tory informs us that in Britain, Ireland, Germany and America, Presbyterians have been full as loyal and pacific as other churches; and we have found it true. The Anatomi&s;t, by overturning the rubbi&s;h of confu&s;ed times, may find enough in any Church to make <HI>him</HI> cautious. By raking up the a&s;hes of the dead, and repre&s;enting things agreeable to his own tem|per, he may indeed foment debates, promote jealou&s;ies in the minds of incon&s;iderate per&s;ons, and favour &s;ome political plans not very &s;alutary to the colonies. But, is it likely, that by good rea&s;oning, he will either be of &s;ervice or an honour to the Church of England? On the contrary has he not given too much rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, either tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his capacity is in&s;ufficient to maintain a con&s;i&s;tency in his rea&s;oning, or that his pa&s;&s;ions will not permit him? Even the paragraph of Mr. Carmichael, that he has foi&s;ted into his piece, though not expre&s;&s;ed in the be&s;t manner, may be taken in a con&s;i&s;tent and ju&s;tifiable &s;en&s;e;
<PB N="29" REF="011212_0015_0F862CEF6405F068">but his own performance never can. And is not &s;uch a defence wor&s;e than none? Wherefore, if he would be &s;o wi&s;e as to take a friendly advice, he would re&s;ign the Centinel at pre&s;ent to another hand. And if he really believes what he has printed, that the Centinel <HI>has been long nodding,</HI> he need not doubt that he has dropped a&s;leep, and con&s;equently that it would be no credit to an Anatomi&s;t either to flay him, or begin his kind of operation upon him in that condition, but had better take a nap al&s;o. Would he but yield to this, we might have &s;ome hopes that after his awaking he would be much better compo&s;ed, and inclined to entertain us with &s;omething &s;alutary and pacific. Therefore, wi&s;hing him a calm repo&s;e, I proceed to &s;eek what is of more importance, the peace of my country.</P>
<P>Although our &s;eperate intere&s;ts in the&s;e American provinces have &s;ometimes occa&s;ioned jars; yet the harmony that of late appeared in &s;upport of our common privileges mu&s;t, I think, afford un&s;peakable plea&s;ure to every lover of his country. For my own part, I con&s;ider the man as a friend, a brother and a patron, who undauntedly exerts him&s;elf to promote a rational concord either in Church or State. Some have merited well of the State by their e&s;&s;ays to unite us in political affairs, as the Penn&s;ylvania Farmer. And would to God that the zealous contenders for Chri&s;tianity would &s;hew their &s;kill, and be more a&s;&s;iduous in labouring to heal our unchri&s;tian divi&s;ions in the Church. Upon this head let me beg the attention of &s;uch, to the following queries. Is there any country in the world more divided in their &s;entiments about religion than we are? Are not our divi&s;ions very injurious in many re&s;pects? Do they not weaken confidence, promote jealou&s;ies, mar our profiting by the gifts and talents of each other, put a &s;tumbling block in the way of infidels, open a door to error, and greatly di&s;honour God? Would not our agreement in &s;piritual truths and duties tend more, firmly to unite us in our temporal affairs, and render us more like an army with banners, yea like the heavenly &s;ociety? Has not the Church of Chri&s;t been long expecting and praying for a time of greater purity and peace? And has not God him&s;elf given us grounds to expect this by his promi&s;e Col. xiv. 9. that <HI>he &s;hall be king over all the earth; that there &s;hall be one Lord, and his name one;</HI> and by many other places to the like purpo&s;e? He will &s;urely accompli&s;h his promi&s;es in the u&s;e of means; and as he has not told us the time when, ought we not always to be u&s;ing &s;uch means as appear proper? Do we expect or can we attempt any thing more noble in this world? How ab&s;urd would it be for enquirers after truth (which we all profe&s;s our&s;elves to be) to content them&s;elves with
<PB N="30" REF="011212_0016_0F862CF0B3652678">being of the &s;ame religion with their ance&s;tors, &s;o glory that they are of the &s;ame religion with the King? Has all been at|tempted that can, or may not the &s;ame attempts be renewed? Altho' a reconciliation with &s;ome has long ago been attempted in vain, are we &s;ure it will always be &s;o; or are all differences of a religious nature incurable? A union between Epi&s;copali|ans and Presbyterians is de&s;ired by thou&s;ands on both &s;ides. Their difference in articles about the doctrines of religion is next to nothing. There is not that &s;trictne&s;s with regard to &s;ome canons and ceremonies that u&s;ed to be; and an emenda|tion in the&s;e is de&s;ired by a great many &s;ober Epi&s;copalians. We have no dignified Clergymen who&s;e intere&s;t might perhaps pre|vent their yielding to &s;ome requi&s;itions that po&s;&s;ibly might be thought rea&s;onable, &s;o that now is the fitte&s;t like &s;ea&s;on. But if an agreement between the&s;e churches cannot be effected, perhaps it might between others that do not differ &s;o much. And were prudent and Chri&s;tian mea&s;ures taken, a better under&s;tanding might be promoted among all Con&s;ider that attempts of this nature have been &s;ucce&s;sful of late years among &s;ome who had been at great variance. A happy omen truly! But as &s;ome de|&s;ire to hear the minds of others, I hope they will take the op|portunity and &s;peak freely. And let them con&s;ider, that <HI>the Lord ble&s;&s;es the peace-makers, and calls them his children;</HI> whereas <HI>he who &s;oweth di&s;cord among brethren is one of tho&s;e &s;even things that are an abomination to the Lord.</HI> If per&s;ons of moderation and judgment on each &s;ide would agree candidly to di&s;cu&s;s the matters of difference, adhere to nece&s;&s;ary regulations in their rea&s;oning, &s;ubmit to the corrections of men cho&s;en to keep them to rule; might not this an&s;wer a good end? E&s;pecial|ly if friendly conferences were agreed upon and kept up. Si quid novi&s;ti rectius i&s;tis candidus imparte, &s;i non, his utere mecum.</P>

The&s;e things, with &s;undry others, being fairly proved or being frequently a&s;&s;erted, it mu&s;t follow of natural con&s;e|quence that a bi&s;hop is a very harmle&s;s per&s;on.

Perhaps the reader does not &s;ee how &s;uch con&s;equences can follow from the premi|&s;es; but they mu&s;t and &s;hall follow&mdash;for to &s;peak our mind plainly, we have a had opinion of the vulgar method of handling a debate&mdash;Nothing is &s;o &s;tubborn as plain direct argument; We are determined to &s;hun it&mdash;But we &s;hall deal pretty freely with the characters of the dead, and if the Centinel or his gho&s;t &s;hould ever think proper to an&s;wer us, we &s;hall lead him &s;uch a wild-goo&s;e chace from one piece of &s;candal to another, that no per&s;on &s;hall be able to gue&s;s, in a little time, what was the original &s;ubject of debate.&mdash;As to the que&s;tion whether a bi&s;hop &s;hould be &s;ent over to America, how he &s;hould be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, and how the liberties of other denominations of Chri&s;|tians would be &s;afe within his reach.

<P>"Soon after the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the &s;ociety for the propa|gation of the go&s;pel in foreign parts, in the year 1701, the Rev.

Colonel <HI>Heathcote,</HI> a worthy gentleman of a con&s;iderable intere&s;t in <HI>We&s;t-Che&s;ter,</HI> was plea&s;ed to accompany Mr. <HI>Muir&s;on</HI> in this progre&s;s, and afterwards wrote to the &s;ociety the following ac|count of their reception there. <Q>We found that colony much as we expected, very ignorant of the con&s;titution of our <HI>Church,</HI> and therefore enemies to it. The towns are furni&s;h|ed with mini&s;ters chiefly <HI>Independants,</HI> who were very unea&s;y at our coming among them, and abundance of pains were taken to terrify the people from hearing Mr. <HI>Muir&s;on;</HI> but it availed nothing, for notwith&s;tanding all their endeavours, we had a very great congregation; and the people were won|derfully &s;urpri&s;ed at the order of our Church, expecting to have heard &s;ome &s;trange thing, by the accounts and repre&s;en|tations of it that their teachers had given them.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e people having zealou&s;ly pre&s;&s;ed Mr. <HI>Muir&s;on</HI> to come again to them, he was honoured with Colonel <HI>Heathcote</HI>'s company in his &s;econd vi&s;it. They now found the people much more earne&s;t to have the Church wor&s;hip &s;ettled among them, and the <HI>Independents</HI> more incen&s;ed. The mini&s;ters and magi&s;trates were remarkably indu&s;trious, going from hou&s;e to hou&s;e per&s;uading the people from hearing Mr. <HI>Muir&s;on,</HI> and threatening tho&s;e with puni&s;hment and impri&s;onment who would go to hear him preach. Mr. <HI>Muir&s;on</HI> de&s;cribes their oppo&s;ition in the&s;e words. <Q>One of their magi&s;trates, with &s;ome other officers, came to my lodgings, and in the hearing of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>Heathcote</HI> and a great many people, read a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> ing of it was, to let me know, that I had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">

<P>But the&s;e methods which the <HI>Independents</HI> u&s;ed, were &s;o far from hindering the people from re&s;orting to the Church &s;ervice, that &s;till greater numbers came; and other towns &s;ent and in|vited Mr. <HI>Muir&s;on</HI> to vi&s;it them; particularly the people of <HI>Fairfield,</HI> to whom he went next. The <HI>Independents</HI> u&s;ed all means to ob&s;truct him, and refu&s;ed him the u&s;e of the meeting-hou&s;e, though on a week day; but the principal gentleman of the town invited him to his hou&s;e, where he preached to a nu|merous congregation, and afterwards de&s;cribed to the &s;ociety the oppo&s;ition he &s;till met with in the&s;e words: <Q>The people were likewi&s;e threatened with <HI>impri&s;onment</HI> and a forfeiture of <HI>five pounds</HI> for coming to hear me.

All that the <HI>Churchmen</HI> in this colony reque&s;t, is, that they may not be oppre&s;&s;ed and in&s;ulted over; that they may obtain a liberty of con&s;cience, and call a mi|ni&s;ter of their own; that they may be freed from paying to <HI>their</HI> mini&s;ters and thereby be enabled to maintain their own; this is all the&s;e good men de&s;ire.</Q>

<P>He has likewi&s;e &s;trongly a&s;&s;erted the divine right of dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy, and the nece&s;&s;ity of an uninterupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of bi&s;hops for the ordination of mini&s;ters, nay he makes this un|broken line as nece&s;&s;ary, as to believe in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and there|by

<P>He repre&s;ents the prelates that are to be &s;ent on this new plan, as per&s;ons to be inve&s;ted with great power and dignity, to protect both the clergy and laity; for who&s;e &s;upport great funds are provided; who may po&s;&s;ibly be entru&s;ted with great power in our civil affairs, and for who&s;e &s;upport he tells us, it is rea&s;onable that we &s;hould all be taxed, and that we de&s;erve not the name of good &s;ubjects if we &s;hould complain if taxed for this purpo&s;e; nay, he tells us, that the epi&s;copal church is e&s;tabli&s;hed in America as well as in England, for it is a part of that church, and all that belong not to that church by law e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, have no natural rights to any degree of civil or milita|ry power.</P>
<P>When &s;uch a challenge was given to all the American colonies, is it a crime, to make objections when thus called on by the Doctor? Were his high preten&s;ions to be pa&s;&s;ed without notice? or how can this univer&s;al appeal be called a continuation of a di&s;pute between the epi&s;copal and other New-England mini&s;|ters? Was the appeal made to them only, or was it to every denomination in the Engli&s;h colonies? or did Dr. Chauncey who wrote a methodical an&s;wer to the appeal ever under&s;tand or &s;u&s;pect, that it was a continuation of an old controver&s;y? The Centinel does not think that he had any concern with the New-England controver&s;ies, the rejectors of dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy in tho&s;e four provinces are able to manage their own affairs, and in the judgment of mo&s;t men are more than a match for their adver&s;aries in America, even with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their friends beyond the Atlantic, though we are told that a high dignitary of the church of England refre&s;hed their drooping &s;pirits by his &s;ea&s;onable interpo&s;ition, nay Dr. Chandler, &s;ets this controver|&s;y in a different light and tells us, <Q>that having addre&s;&s;ed the public on the expediency of an American epi&s;copate, he and his brethren judged it a matter of nece&s;&s;ity and duty fairly to explain this plan on which bi&s;hops had been reque&s;ted to offer to the public the rea&s;ons of this reque&s;t, and to obviate objections: For this rea&s;on he was ordered to publi&s;h the ap|peal, that all might either be &s;atisfied or that &s;uch as were not, might publi&s;h their objections,</Q> yet our mode&s;t <HI>Anato|mi&s;t</HI> declares the Doctor was not the aggre&s;&s;or, and thus all the&s;e objects that he di&s;likes or cannot an&s;wer, are called unme|rited abu&s;e.</P>
<P>It has been often objected to Dr. Chandler, that he has gi|ven the world no a&s;&s;urance that his propo&s;ed plan of Epi&s;copacy
<PB N="43" REF="011212_0022_0F862CF7C7A8D890">&s;o &s;avourable to civil and religious liberty is approved by all the Epi&s;copal Churches in England and America; that if it gave all the colonies the univer&s;al &s;atisfaction that he expected, yet it was propo&s;ed by him&s;elf only, or by a few of his friends, and would be denied or oppo&s;ed by all the narrow bigots in that church, it would probably be rejected by the powers that could confirm i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, for &s;ome political rea&s;ons, as it would weaken the dependency of the colonies on the mother country; and it would be rejected by all &s;ober men, becau&s;e the&s;e bi&s;hops were only to in&s;pect the morals of the clergy, whil&s;t the laity were totally to be neglected. And it was alledged that prelates, if once &s;ent among us, would erect their eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts, as in former times, and po&s;&s;ibly vex every religious denomination, that they were plea&s;ed to call di&s;&s;enters, as in the days of Arch|bi&s;hop Land, and &s;ome of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, who&s;e tyranny drove many to &s;eek habitations in this wilderne&s;s. The&s;e fears arou&s;|ed and alarmed great numbers who paid little regard to Dr. Chandler's fair words, whil&s;t they &s;aw the dangerous &s;nare laid for their liberties by his &s;pecious propo&s;als. And we find alrea|dy by the <HI>Anatomi&s;t,</HI> that our fears were ju&s;t, that mo&s;t of the epi&s;copalians paid no regard to his pretences, for he now a&s;ks,&mdash;<Q>Had Dr. Chandler any general commi&s;&s;ion from that church or even from his brethren belonging to it in America? This is not, &s;ays he, pretended. It is certain that not more than half a dozen of them ever had an opportunity of &s;eeing his pamphlet till in print.</Q></P>
<P>The Centine&s;'s debate is only with Dr. Chandler, and he with his friends are loudly called on to an&s;wer the Centinel and to &s;hew his mi&s;takes; if he bears hard on the church of Eng|land as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed, with re&s;pect to her eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts, or any other part of her conduct, he or they are to vindicate her as far as it can be done with truth and candour, and her vindi|cation will be heard with plea&s;ure and fairly acknowledged, where the defence is ju&s;t; but this <HI>doughty champion</HI> declines this ta&s;k. Yet to &s;ay &s;omething like argument, he cries the national church is abu&s;ed, he will defend the national church &mdash;the religion of his Sovereign, and of the far greater and mo&s;t re&s;pectable part of his &s;ubjects, and Dr. Chandler is, by him, &s;et on a level with Mr. Carmichael, whom no man ever employed nor thanked for meddling with public affairs, both we hope are good men; but our re&s;pect for Doctor Chandler, makes us re&s;ent the compari&s;on.</P>
<P>How <HI>noble is the purpo&s;e</HI> of the Anatomi&s;t and how &s;ecure of a victory? He is in the &s;ame &s;ituation with the champion at a coronation, who armed <HI>cap a pee</HI> challenges all pretenders to

It would have equal force in Turkey in defence of the A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oran, again&s;t the religion of Je&s;us; and in France, again&s;t all the pro|te&s;tants, that have been inhumanly per&s;ecuted &s;ince the revoca|tion of the edict of Nantz. They all plead for the national religion, the religion, of their &s;overeign, and of the mo&s;t re|&s;pectable part of his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>We re&s;pect the church of England as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed, and &s;he is de&s;ervedly re&s;pected by all Chri&s;tian churches.</P>
<P>She has had martyrs that &s;ealed the truths of the go&s;pel with their blood, and many bi&s;hops, mini&s;ters, and common Chri&s;ti|ans eminent for learning, piety and charity, that have been e&s;teemed bright ornaments of our holy religion: And with plea&s;ure we acknowledge that her complexion is greatly mended by the act of toleration.</P>
<P>But &s;he never pretended to infallibility, &s;he daily confe&s;&s;es to Almighty God, that &s;he has erred and &s;trayed like a lo&s;t &s;heep, and done many things which &s;he ought not to have done, during the long and &s;evere execution of the acts of uniformity, the act again&s;t conventicles and others, that di&s;tre&s;&s;ed the followers of the &s;ame Redeemer and the children of the &s;ame heavenly Fa|ther; her looks were &s;avage and &s;evere, and bore a near re&s;em|blance of her who was drunk with the blood of the &s;aints: there were always in her a moderate and a high flying party, and the la&s;t were for &s;evere mea&s;ures to all that did not come into their mea&s;ures. And had the corporation and te&s;t acts ne|ver exi&s;ted &s;he had been more lovely and the &s;pou&s;e of him who was meek and lowly in &s;pirit. We revere her merit, but are not blind to ber imperfection; in her there is great room for a reformation, this the be&s;t of her own &s;ons do allow; nay they loudly call for it; the Lutheran and Calvini&s;t churches were and are &s;till more truly the bulwark of the reformation than the church of England. They bore the burden and heat of the day, when old Harry was pleading the cau&s;e of popery, and acquired from Rome the glorio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itle of defender of the Faith.

<P>ALTHOUGH furni&s;hed with &s;undry papers from <HI>Horatio,</HI> and other corre&s;pondents, which would &s;till further de|mon&s;trate the early &s;ettled plan of New-England In|dependents, &amp;c. to oppre&s;s and bear down the <HI>Church,</HI> for the &s;ake of erecting an exclu&s;ive dominion of their own, yet I am unwilling to lengthen out the&s;e papers into more numbers than tho&s;e of the <HI>Centinel.</HI> I likewi&s;e forbear many things on ac|count of the pre&s;ent critical &s;ituation of the people of <HI>New-England;</HI> and would not be provoked, to &s;eek any ungenerous advantage, from times or circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>The eyes of many are now upon them. If the pre&s;ent lead which they take in the affairs of America be with the &s;ingle view of &s;upporting the cau&s;e of general <HI>Liberty;</HI> if it &s;hall betray

<P>With the&s;e reflections, which may &s;tand in the room of many that might come in this place, I leave the&s;e people for the pre|&s;ent, and proceed to a more &s;outhern province, where the op|po&s;ition to the <HI>Church</HI> has been more properly and &s;trictly <HI>Pre&s;byterian;</HI> but the mode and &s;pirit of it the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The antagoni&s;ts of the Church in America are well aware of the grievous hard&s;hips &s;he labours under, in being obliged to &s;end her candidates acro&s;s an ocean of 3000 miles for holy or|ders, and in being at that di&s;tance from the government of Bi|&s;hops,&mdash;the only mode of government which &s;he can hold agreeable to her con&s;titution.

And therefore they think, if they can continue the Church under this hard&s;hip, and prevent the introduction of a Bi&s;hop into America, by painting the whole order in odi|ous characters, and dangerous to liberty, they &s;hall be able, when they arrive to their

<PB N="47" REF="011212_0024_0F862CF926208B38">for holy orders. The con&s;tant endeavour therefore of tho&s;e antagoni&s;ts of the Church, is to dry up that fund, by repre|&s;enting it as mi&s;applied and perverted from its original inten|tion. This charge is always a leading one in every attack upon the Church in America; though it has been often abundantly an|&s;wered, and though it be evident that the greate&s;t part of the fund comes from the clergy of the Church of England them&s;elves, who well know for what purpo&s;e their charity is be&s;towed, and ap|plied; not to mention that the accounts of the &s;ociety, agreea|ble to charter, have annually the &s;olemn &s;anction of the heads of the three great courts in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall. Strange it is then that the great oracles of the law, the whole clergy of the Church, and thou&s;ands of pious benefactors in England, &s;hould all be &s;o deceived in the original de&s;ign of this &s;ociety, or &s;hould be &s;o de&s;perately wicked as to connive at, or encourage a per|ver&s;ion of it; and that a few zealots at 3000 miles di&s;tance &s;hould be the only per&s;ons acquainted with the purpo&s;es for which the &s;ociety was in&s;tituted.</P>
<P>Upon this plan were a &s;et of papers written and publi&s;hed at New-York, in the years 1752, 1753, called the <HI>Independent Reflectors</HI> and <HI>Watch-Towers,</HI> which I &s;carce think it worth while to di&s;turb in that &s;ilence wherein they now <HI>rot,</HI> e&s;pecially as every thing worth notice in them has been ha&s;hed out into <HI>new di&s;hes,</HI> by the <HI>Centinel,</HI> and will be an&s;wered in the proper place.</P>
<P>Soon after the publication of the Independent Reflectors, &amp;c. a hi&s;tory of New-York was publi&s;hed by <HI>William Smith,</HI> A. M. in which the old hackneyed charges again&s;t the &s;ociety for the propagation of the go&s;pel were carefully in&s;erted. No doubt that gentleman imagined that this work (being a hi&s;tory and quarto volume) might have a greater chance of reaching po&s;terity than loo&s;e or detached papers; and I am per&s;uaded he would take it ami&s;s to have it pa&s;&s;ed over in neglect. I &s;hall therefore the more readily be&s;tow &s;ome notice on is, as the
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>A late writer, in an excellent pamphlet written in an&s;wer to Mr.</HI> Living&s;ton<HI>'s letter to the Bi&s;hop of Landaff, has the following ju&s;t remark on Mr. Smith's partiality, "The author, though obliged to plead the indefea&s;ible right of his profe&s;&s;ion founded upon immemorable pre&s;cription, for being too verbo&s;e&mdash;although his verbo&s;ity is di&s;covered in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">awing the characters of the Pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters in New-York, and in the profu&s;ion of prai&s;es he be&s;tows on them; yet when &s;peaking of the Revd.

He is &s;uch a niggard of his words that he can only give this</HI> pitiful <HI>infor|mation&mdash;"that Mr. Barclay had formerly been a mi&s;&s;ionary among the Mohawks." It was more con&s;i&s;tent with the apparent de&s;ign of his hi&s;tory to tell, that "the tops of the pillars that &s;upport the galleries in Trinity Church are decked with the gilt bu&s;ts of angels winged, and the alleys paved with flat &s;tones; than to place good Dr. Barclay's character in a ju&s;t light, or mention his labours and &s;ucce&s;s among the Indians." So far this writer&mdash;and had Mr.</HI> Smith <HI>only neglected to give Dr. Barclay due prai&s;e, we &s;hould have had le&s;s to &s;ay. But the &s;ociety and Dr. Barclay too were to be charged by this impartial hi&s;torian, with neglecting the Indians, perverting their fund, &amp;c. which charge the Centinel repeats, and therefore the &s;ame an&s;wer will &s;erve for both.</HI></NOTE> partial and ungenerous
<PB N="48" REF="011212_0025_0F862CFA267083E0">manner in which he hath written on certain points, will be a further proof of that &s;pirit of bitterne&s;s and intolerancy tran&s;|mitted from father to &s;on, through his whole party, again&s;t the <HI>Church.</HI></P>
<P>It is lucky for me on this occa&s;ion that I have nothing to do, but to tran&s;cribe an an&s;wer which was prepared for that part of Mr. <HI>Smith</HI>'s hi&s;tory, &s;oon after its fir&s;t appearance by the late worthy Dr. <HI>Henry Barclay,</HI> Rector of Trinity Church in New-York; who had the be&s;t opportunities for detecting the particular mi&s;repre&s;entations here referred to. It plea&s;ed God that Dr. <HI>Barclay</HI> did not &s;urvive the fini&s;hing this an&s;wer long enough to publi&s;h it, nor was he in any particular ha&s;te about it; but he had intended it for the pre&s;s, &s;ent a copy to the vene|rable &s;ociety, and another copy to &s;ome of his brethren in Penn|&s;ylvania; from which the copy now before me was tran&s;cribed. I &s;hall lay before the reader &s;uch extracts from it as &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary in the pre&s;ent di&s;pute: And if what has been in&s;erted in the two former numbers from my friend <HI>Horatio,</HI> &s;hould to any appear too &s;evere (though not near &s;o &s;evere as the provocation given) I am &s;ure the amiable Chri&s;tian &s;pirit of Dr. <HI>Barclay</HI> will be plea&s;ing to all, and I think mu&s;t even induce Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> him|&s;elf to venerate his memory.</P>
<P>The an&s;wer of this worthy man begins with a remark (which it is thought will appear ju&s;t in the &s;equel) that <Q>the author of the hi&s;tory labours under too great an attachment to a particular &s;ect to be impartial in his account of the &s;tate of religion in America.

<P>Mr. Smith's accounts of the Indian mi&s;&s;ion which are the ob|jects of the Doctor's an&s;wer run thus&mdash;<HI>"Nothing to the purpo&s;e hath yet been attempted in England for the propagation of Chri&s;tianity among the Indians.

<P>Here &s;ays the benevolent Dr. Barclay "I find my&s;elf obliged to undertake a very di&s;agreeable ta&s;k&mdash;the vindication of the &s;ociety, as well as my own character requiring me to &s;ay things that would come with much better grace from others. I never thought it becoming me to make a parade of the di&s;charge of tho&s;e things which I was under an indi&s;pen&s;ible obligation to perform. I have never publi&s;hed a journal of my mi&s;&s;ion; nor &s;hould I have had any occa&s;ion at pre&s;ent to give &s;o particular an account of my labours among the Mohawks, had this gentleman either done me ju&s;tice or left my name out of his hi&s;tory. It is well known in this province that I have neither been altogether re|mi&s;s nor un&s;ucce&s;sful; and that I never alledged the want of a &s;uitable provi&s;ion for an interpreter as the rea&s;on for breaking up the mi&s;&s;ion; a rea&s;on which I blu&s;h to think that any per&s;on &s;hould be led to think me capable of a&s;&s;igning, after near twelve years re&s;idence among them. From Mr. Smith's account indeed no per&s;on, unacquainted with my labours in that mi&s;&s;ion, can conclude that I did any more than make my appearance among the Mohawks, and that the &s;ociety being unwilling or unable to pay an Interpreter.

<P>Here we &s;ee men of the fir&s;t reputation te&s;tifying that as early as the year 1736, Dr. <HI>Barclay</HI> was able to perform divine &s;er|vice to the Indians in their own tongue. Could one profe&s;&s;ing to write the hi&s;tory of his country be ignorant of this te&s;timony, or the &s;um granted by the a&s;&s;embly to reward this worthy man for the pains he had taken to qualify him&s;elf as an Indian mi&s;&s;ion|ary, by acquiring their language? Or what but the mo&s;t de|termined re&s;olution to traduce the &s;ociety and the <HI>Church,</HI> at all hazards, could make Mr. Smith &s;ay, that after ten years longer re&s;idence among the Indians "Mr. Barclay was obliged to break up the mi&s;&s;ion, no &s;uitable provi&s;ion being made for an interpreter." Impartiality and candor (&s;ays a writer already quoted concerning this hi&s;tory) are qualities <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">tially nece&s;&s;ary to an
<PB N="51" REF="011212_0026_0F862CFAA2878DC8">hi&s;torian. The hi&s;tory in which due regard is paid to the&s;e, will be read and e&s;teemed; while &s;uch as breath a contrary &s;pi|rit, and are ju&s;t intended to &s;erve a party, will be neglected and de&s;pi&s;ed."</P>
<P>In my next I &s;hall give the nece&s;&s;ary extracts from the remainder of the Doctor's an&s;wer; in which there will appear many more &s;triking proofs of this <HI>Pre&s;byterian Hi&s;torian</HI>'s impartiality and candor towards the <HI>Church.</HI> Nor let the <HI>Centinel</HI> think, all this while, that I am lo&s;ing &s;ight of him. While I am re&s;u|ting his ma&s;ters and predece&s;&s;ors, from whom he has copied his &s;candal, I &s;hall be making &s;ome progre&s;s in the refutation of him. I have been led by a corre&s;pondent a little tour north|wards, but he may &s;ee I am now on my return.</P>
<P>My plan has been con&s;i&s;tent, from the beginning; and when I have fully &s;hewn who have been the aggre&s;&s;ors in this di&s;pute, I &s;hall, as I propo&s;ed, enter the li&s;ts with the <HI>Centinel.</HI> Why can he not have a little patience? He was fairly and without interruption heard out his <HI>fifteen</HI> papers. Before I arrive at that number I &s;hall certainly take notice of what he calls "the truth and validity of his arguments upon the danger of epi&s;co|pal e&s;tabli&s;hments in this new world. And fifty &s;uch papers as tho&s;e of <HI>Irenicus</HI> and the <HI>Anti-Centinel,</HI> &s;hall not divert me from my plan. The&s;e papers &s;hall be noticed in due time if they appear worthy of any; and in the mean while, I would advi&s;e their author or authors to be very careful of &s;etting any more examples of <HI>per&s;onal</HI> invectives; which, as they have been hi|therto avoided on both &s;ides, I was in hopes might be avoided to the end of this di&s;pute; by which means it may be of much &s;horter duration, and that harmony be &s;ooner re&s;tored for which <HI>Irenicus</HI> &s;o warmly preaches. It is a pity that he had not be|&s;towed his advice on the <HI>Centinel</HI> at the commencement of his papers; but to tell the <HI>Church</HI> now, that &s;he is to bear the whole load of abu&s;e patiently, and without a reply, can have but little weight; when we find that more than a century's forbearance on her part, has only aggravated the in&s;olence of her antago|ni&s;ts in America.</P>

<P>IN my la&s;t, I had given &s;ome account of the attack made on the Church by Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> the <HI>impartial Pre&s;byterian Hi&s;torian</HI> of <HI>New-York;</HI> and endeavoured to &s;hew, that nothing but the mo&s;t determined re&s;olution to traduce the Church, and the Society for the propagation of the go&s;pel, could have induced that gentleman to a&s;&s;ert, that the late Dr. <HI>Barclay</HI> was obliged to break up his <HI>Mohawk</HI> mi&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e no &s;uitable provi&s;ion had been made for an interpreter by the Society.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Barclay</HI> received holy orders, and was appointed to that mi&s;&s;ion in 1737; and &s;uppo&s;ing Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> &s;o extremely igno|rant of the tran&s;actions of the country whereof he undertakes to write a hi&s;tory, as not to know that Dr. <HI>Barclay</HI> had, at a provincial expence, &s;pent two years in endeavouring to acquire the <HI>Mohawk</HI> language, before he went for orders, and carried home with him a certificate from the commi&s;&s;ioners for <HI>Indian</HI> affairs, &s;etting forth, that he had attained &s;uch a knowledge in that language, as to be able to perform divine &s;ervice in it; yet &s;urely the hi&s;torian mu&s;t have &s;een the following me&s;&s;age from Governor <HI>Clarke</HI> in <HI>December</HI> 1740, from which it would &s;eem that the Doctor's labours did not meet with any ob&s;truction from want of &s;kill in the <HI>Indian</HI> language, nor from any other cau&s;e but that mentioned in the me&s;&s;age.</P>
<P><Q>The <HI>Mohawk</HI> &s;achems (&s;ays the Governor to the A&s;&s;em|bly) have repre&s;ented to me the irreparable condition of the chapel formerly built for their religious wor&s;hip, and de&s;iring to have a new one built: I cannot but earne&s;tly recommend it to you, as a thing worthy the con&s;ideration of a Chri&s;tian a&s;&s;embly. The progre&s;s already made by the reverend Mr. <HI>Barclay,</HI> opens to our view a glorious pro&s;pect of &s;preading
<PB N="53" REF="011212_0027_0F862D0142ADDE08">the Chri&s;tian faith and wor&s;hip throughout all the <HI>Six-Na|tions,</HI> e&s;pecially if he be enabled by you to proceed in the work he has &s;o happily and &s;ucce&s;sfully begun.</Q></P>
<P>"The honourable mention here made of my labours (conti|nues the Doctor) by the Governor, proceeded from the great &s;atisfaction he received in &s;eeing the regular and decent beha|viour of the <HI>Indians</HI> at public wor&s;hip at <HI>Albany,</HI> where he held a treaty with them. For however unhappily my mi&s;&s;ion ended, I had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing &s;ome fruit of my labours 'til the two la&s;t years. I found them a mo&s;t ignorant &s;avage people, &s;o uni|ver&s;ally addicted to drunkenne&s;s, that &s;carce a day pa&s;&s;ed with|out &s;eeing &s;everal of them intoxicated, and frequently above three-fourths of them, the women as well as men, fighting and tearing each other like ravenous bea&s;ts. They were in a &s;hort time &s;o far reclaimed, that I have &s;ometimes, for two months together, not &s;een above ten of them drunk; and the women, excepting a few of the elder, were wholly reclamed."</P>
<P>"It is well known that I was &s;o univer&s;ally beloved, that I became the umpire of all their differences, and had &s;o great an a&s;cendant over them, that they permitted me to appoint officers to &s;eize all &s;pirituous liquors that were brought among them for &s;ale. I found them without the u&s;e of letters, which ren|dering their in&s;truction very tedious, obliged me to open a &s;chool, teach them to read and write, which I attended &s;ix hours a day, the two fir&s;t years, with &s;uch &s;urpri&s;ing &s;ucce&s;s, that in about four years from my fir&s;t coming among them, many were able to bear their parts in the Church &s;ervice with great decency and regularity. Many of them were well advanced in the know|ledge of Chri&s;tianity; and their attendance and behaviour at public wor&s;hip was matter of reproach to their neighbours, who had enjoyed the light of the go&s;pel from their infancy, under much greater advantages."</P>
<P>"Thus I went on, encouraged with a mo&s;t plea&s;ing pro&s;|pect of &s;eeing the ri&s;ing generation a very regular and &s;erious Chri&s;tian congregation; and, at the &s;ame time, had the oppor|tunity of preaching once every Lord's day to a con&s;iderable <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> congregation, and &s;ometimes to a much larger of <HI>Low-Dutch,</HI> who&s;e language I was well ver&s;ed in. But, to my great grief and mortification, the&s;e plea&s;ing hopes were &s;oon cut off. A &s;trange jealou&s;y was infu&s;ed into the poor <HI>Indians,</HI> a little before the breaking out of the la&s;t <HI>French</HI> war, by a very wicked and ma|licious per&s;on, of which I gave the Society an account. Upon this I found their regard and affection for me &s;en&s;ibly dimini&s;hing till the latter end of the year 1744; when, in the dead of night, the <HI>Indians</HI> were alarmed with a pretended di&s;covery of a hor|rid
<PB N="54" REF="011212_0028_0F862D0211A3A000">plot to murder them all, of which I was repre&s;ented as the chief contriver. This would have co&s;t me my life in the rage of their fir&s;t re&s;entments, had not &s;ome of the more intelligent among them, as they afterwards confe&s;&s;ed, prevented it. The particulars of this affair I al&s;o gave the Society an account of at the time when it happened, and they are al&s;o very well known to the honourable Mr. <HI>Clinton,</HI> who was at that time Governor of <HI>New York.</HI> I continued after this, near fifteen months, la|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ouring under the greate&s;t di&s;couragements, and u&s;ing all po&s;|&s;ible methods to regain their confidence and affection, but with little &s;ucce&s;s, and at la&s;t, by the advice of &s;ome of my &s;teadie&s;t friends among the <HI>Indians</HI> them&s;elves, I retired to <HI>Albany</HI> in <HI>April</HI> 1746."</P>
<P>"The&s;e were the rea&s;ons of my leaving the <HI>Indians,</HI> and not the want of a &s;uitable provi&s;ion for an interpreter &mdash;From whom Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> had his information concerning the rea&s;on of my breaking up my mi&s;&s;ion, I know not; but he has been ac|quainted with me upwards of ten years la&s;t pa&s;t, and might have &s;een me almo&s;t every day during that time. In the note under the forty &s;econd page, he gives an account of the "extreme mortification, inextingui&s;hable zeal, and great &s;ucce&s;s of Mr. <HI>David Brainerd,</HI> a late mi&s;&s;ionary from the <HI>Scotch</HI> Society, among &s;ome <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>New Jer&s;ey, not one of whom,</HI> he tells us, has been concerned in tho&s;e barbarous irruptions which have lately deluged the &s;outh-we&s;tern provinces with the blood of &s;everal hundred innocents of every age and &s;ex." And concludes this note in the following words. "Dr. <HI>Dougla&s;s,</HI> ever ready to do honour to his native country, after remarking that this &s;elf-denying clergyman rode about 400 miles in the year 1744, with an air of approbation a&s;ks, is there any mi&s;&s;ionary from any of the Societies for propagating the go&s;pel in foreign parts, that has reported the like?</P>
<P>"As to Mr. <HI>Brainord's</HI> mortification and zeal, every good man mu&s;t approve and commend the&s;e virtues wherever they are found, and I hope he is now reaping the glorious rewards of them. As to his &s;ucce&s;s, <HI>tho' Paul plant, and Apollos wa|ter, it is God</HI> alone that gives the increa&s;e. I heartily wi&s;h I could &s;ay that I had heard tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> continue the &s;ame re|gular &s;ociety of Chri&s;tians &s;ince his death. His brother and &s;ucce&s;&s;or in that mi&s;&s;ion, I am told, has left them, and taken the charge
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>This was the ca&s;e at the time of Dr.</HI> Barclay<HI>'s writing. But Mr.</HI> Brainerd, <HI>the brother, &s;ince had, and now has, I believe, &s;ome</HI> Jer&s;ey Indians <HI>under his pa&s;toral care, and his labours among them are well reported of.</HI></NOTE> of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> congregation at <HI>Newark.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="011212_0028_0F862D0211A3A000">"With regard to my&s;elf, I confe&s;s that I might have been more mortified, more zealous and indu&s;trious than I have been; and I pray God to pardon my defects. However ble&s;&s;ed be his goodne&s;s, which has enabled me to &s;ay, that I have not been altogether de&s;titute of the&s;e virtues, &s;o indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to an <HI>Indian</HI> mi&s;&s;ionary. And tho' I never reported the num|ber of miles I have rode in the di&s;charge of my mi&s;&s;ion, hun|dreds can atte&s;t that it was many more than 400 every year. And much more is done by &s;everal mi&s;&s;ionaries in the Society's &s;ervice. As to Mr. <HI>Smith</HI>'s remark on that happy effect of Mr. <HI>Brainerd</HI>'s mi&s;&s;ion, viz. "That <HI>not one of tho&s;e Indians</HI> have been concerned in tho&s;e barbarous irruptions, &amp;c. I am per&s;uaded &s;ome prejudice mu&s;t have prevented his making the &s;ame ob&s;ervations with regard to the <HI>Mohawks,</HI> as it is mo&s;t no|torious that they have not only been inoffen&s;ive, but are the only tribe of the Confederates that have openly joined us, and at|tended our armies in the pre&s;ent war."</P>
<P>"But how comes every favourable circum&s;tance that may redound either to the credit of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Society, or their mi&s;&s;ionaries, to be thus pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence by this impartial hi&s;torian, and whence all tho&s;e in&s;inuations to their di&s;advan|tage?" The Doctor gives the &s;ame rea&s;on that has already been advanced; namely, that the intention of all the&s;e mi&s;repre&s;en|tations of the Society, and their conduct, is to dry up the chari|ties which they receive from benevolent minds in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and thus to reduce the intere&s;t of the Church to as low an ebb as po&s;&s;ible in the colonies.</P>
<P>But not content "with pa&s;&s;ing over in &s;ilence what might re|dound to the credit of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Society, and their mi&s;&s;iona|ries," this hi&s;torian, in the abundance of his &s;pleen, does not &s;cruple &s;ometimes to <HI>invent,</HI> rather than fail in, charges again&s;t them.</P>
<P><Q>The Epi&s;copal mi&s;&s;ionaries (&s;ays he, page 42) for enlar|ging the &s;phere of their &s;ecular bu&s;ine&s;s, not many years ago, attempted, by a <HI>petition</HI> to the late Governor <HI>Clinton,</HI> to en|gro&s;s the privilege of &s;olemnizing all marriages. A <HI>great clamour</HI> en&s;ued, and the attempt was abortive.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Barclay</HI> &s;hews this whole paragraph to be an ab&s;olute fal&s;hood. He appeals to Governor <HI>Clinton,</HI> and all concerned in the government, whether any &s;uch attempt was ever made, directly or indirectly, or any &s;uch petition ever pre&s;ented? as to the <HI>great clamour</HI> &s;aid to en&s;ue, he appeals to the whole province (Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> excepted) whether any &s;uch clamour was ever heard?</P>
<P>"I can &s;peak (&s;ays he) with certainty, as Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> fixes the time of this imaginary attempt to Governor <HI>Clinton</HI>'s ad|mini&s;tration, and not many years ago&mdash;Now the petition pre|&s;ented

<P>But it was of little con&s;equence to this hi&s;torian, whether the Epi&s;copal clergy did well or ill. For in the temper with which he wrote, obloquy and mi&s;repre&s;entation were to be their portion. And yet if ever his hi&s;tory &s;hould come to a &s;econd edition, charity would make one hope, that more years, with better con|&s;ideration and enquiry, may relea&s;e him from &s;ome of his pre|judices, and make him appear with that dignity as a hi&s;torian, which his compo&s;ition, and confe&s;&s;ed abilities, might otherwi&s;e give him &s;ome title to hold.</P>
<P>But the party did not choo&s;e to tru&s;t their cau&s;e long to this <HI>hi&s;tory.</HI> For finding, probably, that it &s;oon began to &s;hare the fate of many other <HI>mortal</HI> compo&s;itions, namely, to re&s;t harm|le&s;s on its &s;helf, the ball was &s;till to be kept up again&s;t the Church; as if it were by alternate blows from Pre&s;byterian and Independent.</P>

<HEAD>To the KING. <HI>The di&s;tre&s;&s;ed ca&s;e and reque&s;t of the &s;uffering people, commonly called</HI> QUAKER'S, <HI>humbly pre&s;ented &s;hewing.</HI></HEAD>
<P>"That according to accounts lately given, above <HI>Fourteen hundred</HI> of the &s;aid People, both men and women, are continued pri&s;oners in England and Wales, only for tender con&s;cience to|wards Almighty GOD that made them; many-under &s;entence of <HI>premunire,</HI> and many near it, not for refu&s;ing the duty or &s;ub|&s;tance of allegiance it&s;elf, but only becau&s;e they date not &s;wear. Be&s;ides, <HI>&s;ome hundreds have died pri&s;oners,</HI> many by means of this long impri&s;onment, &s;ince the year 1680, (as it is judged) thereby making widows and fatherle&s;s, and leaving poor inno|cent families in di&s;tre&s;s and &s;orrow. The&s;e two hard winters confinement tending al&s;o to the de&s;truction of many in cold holes and jails, their healths being greatly impaired thereby; be&s;ides, violence and woful &s;poil made by mercile&s;s informers on the conventicle act upon many convicted, un&s;ummoned and un|heard in their own defence, both in city and country; as al&s;o on <HI>qui tam</HI> writs, and other proce&s;s, on twenty pounds a month, and two thirds of e&s;tates &s;eized for the King, all tending to the ruin of trade, hu&s;bandry and indu&s;trious families; to &s;ome not a bed left; to others no cattle to till the ground, or give them milk; nor corn for bread or feed, nor tools to work withal; and all the&s;e and other <HI>&s;everities,</HI> done under a pretence of &s;erving the King and <HI>Church,</HI> and thereby to force us to violate our con&s;ciences, and con&s;equently to de&s;troy our &s;ouls, which we are very tender of, as we are of our peace with GOD, and our own con&s;ciences, though accounted as &s;heep to the &s;laugh|ter. And notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e long &s;u&s;tained extremities, we the &s;aid people do &s;olemnly profe&s;s and declare, in the &s;ight of the Heart-&s;earcher, that we have nothing but good will, and
<PB N="59" REF="011212_0030_0F862D02E2B41050">true affection, to the King, praying for his &s;afety, and the king|dom's peace. We have never been found in any &s;editious or trea&s;onable de&s;igns, as being wholly contrary to our Chri&s;tian principles, and holy profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>"And knowing <HI>where the word of the King is, there is power,</HI> we, in Chri&s;tian humility, and for CHRIST's &s;ake, intreat that the King will plea&s;e to find out &s;ome expedient for our relief in the&s;e ca&s;es, from pri&s;on, &s;poil, and ruin; and we &s;hall (as in Chri&s;tian duty bound) pray GOD for the King's welfare in this world, and his eternal happine&s;s in that which is to come. De|livered to the King the 3d of the Fir&s;t Month called March, 1684-5, with the number of pri&s;oners in every &s;hire, in all 1460."</P>
<P>This petition induced King James to write from his court at Whitehall, April the 18th, 1685, to all <Q><HI>archbi&s;hops, and bi&s;hops, and to their chancellors,</HI> and commi&s;&s;ioners, and to all archdeacons, and other officiates, and to all other ordina|ries, executing eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction, to cau&s;e proce&s;s a|again&s;t the&s;e per&s;ons to be &s;tayed, and if they were in pri&s;on on the writ <HI>de excommunicato capiendo,</HI> to ab&s;olve, di&s;charge and &s;et them all at liberty.</Q> <HI>See</HI> Sewell's <HI>hi&s;tory of the</HI> Quakers, <HI>page</HI> 566.</P>
<P>Would the Quakers, or any other men, wi&s;h to be under the power of &s;uch in&s;truments of cruelty? Or is it unmeritted abu&s;e of the Church of England, to &s;ay that her courts acted after this manner? But the old Puritans, comprehending under that name Pre&s;byterians, Independents, Bapti&s;t, &amp;c. felt the&s;e &s;evere per&s;ecutions for non-conformity to the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church of England, through the long reigns of Elizabeth and of James, before the Quakers became a religious &s;ociety in England. And they were all as &s;everely handred as the&s;e Quaker &s;ufferers, from the re&s;toration till the glorious revolution. And if the Anato|mi&s;t's abu&s;ive pen thus continues to be&s;patter men called forth to plead for their liberties, we &s;hall be obliged to revive the me|mory of tho&s;e &s;evere per&s;ecutions that are now almo&s;t forgotten; and well it is, if all gratitude due to GOD for our glorious de|liverances from &s;uch cruelty, be not al&s;o forgotten.</P>
<P>We are not to be intimidated, though threatened with blood|&s;hed by this writer; we pray GOD there may never be a religi|ous e&s;tabli&s;hment in America to deprive any man, or any religi|ous denomination, of their ju&s;t rights; we de&s;ire none: But he adopts the glorious method pre&s;cribed lately in our Chronicle by an Epi&s;copal clergyman, of clearing him&s;elf by recrimination. When he cannot vindicate him&s;elf and his friends, he boldly charges his accu&s;ers with the &s;ame crime, of e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ecting an e&s;tabli&s;h|ment
<PB N="60" REF="011212_0031_0F862D03E6E35E38">for them&s;elves in this new world. The Epi&s;copal Church, it is well known, already claims an e&s;tabli&s;hment in all the colo|nies, and a &s;uperiority over all other religious per&s;ua&s;ions; they claim it as a kind of birthright, to have their clergy every where &s;upported by all other &s;ocieties, which they reproachful|ly call Di&s;&s;enters. They have &s;truggled hard for an e&s;tabli&s;h|ment in North-Carolina, and are oppre&s;&s;ing that poor colony with new taxes from time to time for purcha&s;ing glebes, building churches, and par&s;onage hou&s;es, for the &s;upport of their clergy, though the number of that church be &s;mall, in compari&s;on of other &s;ocieties. And this unwearied indu&s;try we may expect in all the colonies, to bring North-America every where to pay tribute to hungry ambitious mi&s;&s;ionaries. The Pre&s;byterians, in the&s;e provinces, de&s;ire no e&s;tabli&s;hments, they rather think them hurtful to religion, yet they that claim them, and pant for them, and are willing to move heaven and earth for them, charge this as a crime on their innocent neighbours; but this abu&s;ive writer cares not what he affirms, nor on what foundation, and if per&s;e|cution <HI>to blood &s;triving</HI> mu&s;t be our lot, if we &s;trive to prevent &s;uch oppre&s;&s;ion, we hope we &s;hall be armed with Chri&s;tian pa|tience and fortitude, to do or &s;uffer according to the will of GOD. We de&s;ire no union with him, or any other &s;ociety, to do mi&s;chief, nay we abhor it. We neither de&s;ire nor expect the <HI>attachment of Churchmen,</HI> nor any of the human race, unle&s;s for good purpo&s;es, for the defence of our country in their ju&s;t rights and privileges, and the common good of all men. But we would a&s;k this blu&s;tering writer, Have all Churchmen, as he calls them, given him a commi&s;&s;ion to abu&s;e and threaten their neighbours? Or is he &s;uperior to Dr. Chandler, who is blamed by him for &s;peaking for them without authority? When Pre&s;by|terians are &s;lighted in general, and we hear great encomiums given to Epi&s;copacy, as a national church, we mu&s;t remind this writer, that neither of the&s;e names can warrant men to do mi&s;chief; and that either or both derive their honour from obeying the go&s;pel, and following the example of CHRIST, and not from worldly pomp or grandeur; CHRIST's kingdom is not of this world. But if e&s;tabli&s;hments, or national churches, make Chri&s;tians more venerable; the Pre&s;byterians or Reformed are one of the three religious per&s;ua&s;ions e&s;tabli&s;hed by law in the German Empire. It is one of the two religious per&s;ua&s;ions e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in Switzerland; it is the national religion of Holland and Geneva; and the national church of Scotland is Pre&s;byterian; but all the mini&s;ters of the&s;e churches, with all the Lutheran mini&s;ters of Sweden, Denmark, and the German Empire, are rejected as unworthy the name of go&s;pel mini&s;ters by this bul|wark
<PB N="61" REF="011212_0031_0F862D03E6E35E38">of the reformation, this mirror of charity, which is it&s;elf confined to the narrow bounds of Ireland and England. And let it be for ever remembered, for the honour of Pre&s;byterians, here called a &s;our intolerant party, that univer&s;al liberty of con|&s;cience was fir&s;t proclaimed and e&s;tabli&s;hed among Prote&s;tants in the national church of Holland, where men and women, per&s;e|cuted by both Prote&s;tants and Papi&s;ts, found a &s;ure a&s;&s;ylum, and a city of refuge. The Centinel equally pleaded the common cau&s;e of all other denominations, and the Pre&s;hyterians here a|bu&s;ed, owe him no more thanks than are due to him by all that dread a yoke of bondage, that neither we nor our fathers could bear, and if he be cut up while a&s;leep, and even devoured by this &s;econd Polypheme, we hope there will be men found to vin|dicate Pre&s;byterians, and to defend the common cau&s;e of civil and religious liberty; but as champions and &s;trong men are &s;aid to be merciful, we have hopes that the Centinel may yet e&s;cape his bloody knife and perform his duty.</P>

<P><HI>The Doctor's abu&s;e is thrown out by fits and &s;tarts in &s;uch un|dige&s;ted manner, that I am forced to follow the &s;ame method that his an&s;werer pur&s;ued, and range it under three heads, viz. again&s;t the Church in general, again&s;t the &s;ociety, and again&s;t Bi&s;hops. And this will account for my being obliged to leap from page to page, in order to lay the whole in one &s;hort view. The pages of the London edition are tho&s;e referred to,</HI></P></NOTE></P>
<P>And now, Mr. <HI>Centinel,</HI> what think you of your ma&s;ter <HI>Mayhew?</HI> Have you &s;uch a grand flight in all your work as this, viz. <HI>that your good party is the flying</HI> Woman, <HI>and the Church and Bi&s;hop the pur&s;uing</HI> Serpent? Why could you not, when retailing Dr. <HI>Mayhew,</HI> give us &s;ome of his be&s;t touche? But perhaps he did not &s;uit you in every thing. For, furious as he is in certain places, he has &s;poilt the whole by conce&s;&s;ions in other places. Although he belabours the &s;ociety &s;o vehemently, and pre&s;ents them with the guilt of <HI>Annanias</HI> and <HI>Sapphira,</HI> yet (good man) he declares it <Q>by no means his intention to charge that venerable body with any wilful known mi&s;conduct, or <HI>impro|per applications of Monies,</HI> even though any incautious ex|pre&s;&s;ion &s;hould at fir&s;t view have that appearance.</Q> For no one, he &s;ays, "whoever read their <HI>charter,</HI> can po&s;&s;ibly ima|gine
<PB N="64" REF="011212_0033_0F862D08ADD12BF8">that their care and charity ought to be confined to the hea|then &s;laves in, or the &s;avages bordering on, the plantations."</P>
<P>Again, altho' "Bi&s;hops are mitred lordly &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of the fi&s;hermen o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Galilee; tho' they have a&s;cended from the <HI>dirt</HI> to the <HI>&s;kies;</HI> though they are <HI>&s;erpents</HI> &s;pewng out whole floods to drown the <HI>good woman</HI>"&mdash;yet he declares, all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> while, that he is one &s;peaking one word of any Bi&s;hops that live in the pre&s;ent age, but tho&s;e that lived near a century ago&mdash;for he would not have it thought that "he de&s;igns to di&s;honor the more moderate and Chri&s;tian &s;pirit of the Engli&s;h Bi&s;hops &s;ince the revolution, and particularly of this day, by comparing it to the per&s;ecuting anti-Chri&s;tian &s;pirit of many prelates, antece|dent to that glorious aera."</P>
<P>Amazing this! Though there is le&s;s religion in New-England, than if the &s;ociety's money had been &s;unk in the ocean, yet he does not charge them with improper application of their money &mdash;Though he has de&s;cribed Bi&s;hops as mon&s;ters, yet he has no fault to find with tho&s;e that have lived &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e the revolution &mdash;what then, in the name of &s;en&s;e, has the man been writing about all this while?&mdash;Surely he did not expect that the King was to &s;end over to America any Bi&s;hops that lived before the revolution, for they are all dead long &s;ince.</P>
<P>"Why then &s;uch di&s;mal apprehen&s;ions? Why &s;uch outcries? Where are the per&s;ecutors? Where is the dragon? All the world mu&s;t &s;ee, the doctor him&s;elf might have &s;een, that his declamation was quite foreign to the purpo&s;e; and, on his fir&s;t recollection, he &s;hould have been a&s;hamed of it, and have &s;truck it out. But paternal tenderne&s;s would not let him de&s;troy &s;o pathetic a rant, on &s;o darling a &s;ubject."&mdash;</P>
<P>This la&s;t Paragraph I copy from an an&s;wer given to the Doc|tor in his life time. For although mo&s;t of the attacks made up|on the Church in America, before the Doctor's publication, were &s;uffered to pa&s;s unnoticed; yet, as by the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions which he made here and there, when his raging fits were a little off, he appeared to be under &s;ome compunctions of mind, that might at length open him to conviction; it was judged that an an&s;wer in the &s;pirit of moderation and truth might not be whol|ly thrown away upon him, this an&s;wer was marked in every line with that benevolence of temper, that force of argument, that amiable decorum and yet dignity of expre&s;&s;ion, which cha|racterized an Illu&s;trious Prelate lately decea&s;ed, to whom it hath been generally a&s;cribed&mdash;I mean the great and good Archbi&s;h|op <HI>Secker</HI>&mdash;at mention of whole name, every true &s;on of the <HI>Church,</HI> every lover of primitive integrity, piety and unaffected &s;implicity of manners, mu&s;t drop a tear, as for a father lo&s;t!</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="011212_0033_0F862D08ADD12BF8">Rude as the Doctor's attack on the Church was; although (as he confe&s;&s;es in his &s;econd piece) his expre&s;&s;ions were "too har&s;h and irritating," yet the an&s;werer never forgets him&s;elf or his own character.

<P>As to the charge of per&s;ecution, our an&s;werer ob&s;erves, "that the lawfulne&s;s of it is no doctrine of the <HI>Church</HI>&mdash; that di&s;&s;enters did not &s;uffer their hard&s;hips in England on ac|count of their religious tenets, but becau&s;e, in general, their avowed aim, was not an exemption for them&s;elves, but the de|&s;truction of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;hment&mdash;that on this, they were treated too &s;everely, and they returned the treatment to the full, as &s;oon as they were able, in the total overthrow of Church and &s;tate." He puts them in mind of the doctrine held by the New-England platform, "that <HI>here&s;y is to be re&s;trained and puni&s;hed by the civil magi&s;trate</HI>"&mdash;a doctrine which without an <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hment</HI> has been more rigorou&s;ly carried into execution in that country, than ever it was by the Church at home&mdash;for the confirmation of which, the te&s;timony of a third party is appealed to, namely the <HI>Quakers;</HI> who affirm, <HI>that they who had loudly cried out of the tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion of the Bi&s;hops in old England, from whom they fled, when &s;et|tled in a place where they had liberty to govern, made their lit|tle finger of cruelty bigger than ever they &s;ound the loins of the bi&s;hops</HI>

<P>But I di&s;mi&s;s this charge of per&s;ecution for the pre&s;ent, which (on account of &s;ome old mi&s;takes that are to be lamented on both &s;ides) is &s;till unju&s;tly kept up again&s;t one o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the milde&s;t <HI>Churches</HI> on earth; and if our antagoni&s;ts are not &s;atisfied with what has been already hinted on this head, I &s;hall take another opportunity of comparing notes fully with them, upon it.</P>
<P>The an&s;werer to Doctor <HI>Mayhew,</HI> afterwards proceeds to the charge repeated from Mr. <HI>Smith</HI>'s hi&s;tory (which I have al|ready taken notice of) that Mr. <HI>Barclay</HI>'s mi&s;&s;ion was <HI>&s;tarved</HI> for want of &s;upport, and broken up for want of an interprete<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.
<PB N="66" REF="011212_0034_0F862D0A02AA4040">This charge both by Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> and Dr. <HI>Mayhew,</HI> appears to have been perver&s;ely taken from a letter to Mr. <HI>Serjeant</HI> from Mr. <HI>Barclay,</HI> June 11, 1736, &s;oon after he went among the In|dians, and before he was in orders, or in the &s;ociety's &s;ervice as a mi&s;&s;ionary, and when he was labouring under his fir&s;t difficul|ties in learning the language. Mr. <HI>Barclay</HI> him&s;elf declares that when he came to his mi&s;&s;ion, "he found the &s;ociety at all times, anxiou&s;ly &s;olicitous to encourage him; that they readily con&s;ented to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of two Indian &s;chools; that they ordered him to employ an <HI>interpreter.</HI>" (not indeed to interpret in his <HI>preaching,</HI> but to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the in&s;truction of the youth;) "but that the old <HI>interpreter</HI> being dead, he could never meet with any other qualified for the office; that his &s;ub&s;i&s;tance was comfortable; that he never broke up his mi&s;&s;ion on account of any backwardne&s;s of the venerable &s;ociety to &s;upport him; but from an unavoidable nece&s;&s;ity, on account of ba&s;e, in&s;inuations infu&s;ed by an ill de&s;igning party into the minds of the Indians, ju&s;t before the breaking out of the French war"&mdash;All which, both Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> and Dr, <HI>Mayhew</HI> mu&s;t have well known.

<P>The an&s;werer to Dr. <HI>Mayhew</HI> proceeds farther, to inform him of all the pains and expence of the &s;ociety, in e&s;tabli&s;hing many Indian mi&s;&s;ions which he deigns not to take notice of, and men|tions from the Doctor's own words, the <HI>great di&s;couragements that have been and &s;till are in attempting to Chri&s;tianize the In|dians.</HI>"&mdash;Di&s;couragements which all &s;ides mu&s;t labour with, till God's own time comes for converting them, and till he finds in&s;truments worthy of this great honour.

<HEAD>From the PENNSYLVANIA JOURNAL, Oct, 20. THE REMONSTRANT, No. III.</HEAD>
<P>THAT there is a project on foot to e&s;tabli&s;h Bi&s;hops in America, is publickly avowed and contended for by many of the epi&s;copal Church; and they as confidently con|tend that they are part of the Engli&s;h e&s;tabli&s;hed Church, and that all others are Di&s;&s;enters. But as an epi&s;copate with its ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical courts and other appendages has in former times been found hurtful to other religious &s;ocieties, the plan now propo&s;ed is repre&s;ented in &s;uch a favourable view, as, in their judgment, no rea&s;onable man can object to it. For the&s;e Bi&s;hops are to have no powers but what are purely &s;piritual. They are only to or|dain, confirm and in&s;pect the morals of the clergy of their own denomination. Had twenty &s;uch Bi&s;hops been &s;ent to America, provided they had no connection with our <HI>civil affairs,</HI> nor a <HI>pro&s;pect</HI> of being <HI>able</HI> to <HI>claim</HI> or <HI>exerci&s;e</HI> the powers that made them terrible in England, no man had been unea&s;y about them. But for many rea&s;ons already offered on this &s;ubject, all the co|lonies have ju&s;t grounds to fear that the epi&s;copate really de&s;ired, and which will be e&s;tabli&s;hed, if ever any be e&s;tabli&s;hed among us, will not be &s;o harmle&s;s and innocent as they pretend, nor &s;o like tho&s;e that were in the primitive Church. Even Doctor Chandler, who &s;o &s;trongly a&s;&s;erts that they de&s;ire no power that can be hurtful to the civil or religious rights and privileges of other denominations, paints his intended Bi&s;hops in &s;uch colours as mu&s;t &s;trike all con&s;iderate per&s;ons with terror, and convince them that if Bi&s;hops be once e&s;tabli&s;hed, they will oblige thou|&s;ands once more to &s;eek &s;helter among the &s;avage Indians,</P>
<P>But for want of arguments to refute Doctor Chauncy, the Centinel, Whig, and others who have pointed out our danger; and with a view to turn the public attention from this avowed de|&s;ign of an e&s;tabli&s;hment &s;o dreadful in its con&s;equences, the Anatomi&s;t cries aloud that the colonies are in danger from a Pre&s;|byterian e&s;tabli&s;hment, which, as he alledges, is projected and carrying into execution.</P>
<P>"This four turbulent party, &s;ays he, have ju&s;tly alarmed the fear of every other religious per&s;ua&s;ion in America, and cre|ated a jealou&s;y that the &s;ole view of this party is to erect an em|pire and e&s;tabli&s;hment for them&s;elves in this new world, on the ruin of every other religious denomination. But before they can &s;ucceed in their de&s;igns, they will meet with a re&s;i&s;tance
<PB N="68" REF="011212_0035_0F862D0ACE1BD100">far different from what is to be expected in this paper; a re&s;i&s;t|ance perhaps even unto <HI>blood.</HI> That the epi&s;copal Churches have an e&s;tabli&s;hment in Maryland and Virginia, and the Inde|pendents (as he calls them) have a &s;ort of e&s;tabli&s;hment in &s;ome of the New-England provinces is well known. But a Pre&s;byte|rian e&s;tabli&s;hment in the colonies is neither projected nor de&s;ired, nor can it ever be attempted with any rational pro&s;pect of &s;uc|ce&s;s. No denominations of Chri&s;tians in any of the other colo|nies, the epi&s;copalians only excepted, have the lea&s;t ground to expect it. They, and they only have power and intere&s;t in England, to get &s;uch a bill pa&s;&s;ed in their favour by the King and his Gran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ees, who are all of that per&s;ua&s;ion; but no act pa&s;&s;ed in the colonies to e&s;tabli&s;h Pre&s;bytery, or any religious per&s;ua&s;ion, (epi&s;copacy excepted) on the ruins of other &s;ocieties, would obtain a &s;anction in England. It would be madne&s;s to attempt it, Nay the Lutheran and Pre&s;byterian &s;o|cieties in New-York could not procure even a charter in England for &s;ecuring their churches and burying grounds. Letters of incorporation, &s;uch as are granted to almo&s;t every com|pany of mechanicks, were denied them by the interpo&s;ition of gentlemen of the epi&s;copal e&s;tabli&s;hment, and in particular by one of their Bi&s;hops, as we are informed. With what face then can the Anatomi&s;t alarm the world with the notion of a Pre&s;byterian e&s;tabli&s;hment, a thing in it&s;elf not only improbable, but even impo&s;&s;ible; we utterly deny this charge; It is a ground|le&s;s calumny, without the lea&s;t foundation; and we call on this abu&s;ive writer either to make good his a&s;&s;ertion, or to take to him&s;elf the &s;hame of publi&s;hing notorious fal&s;hoods, for want of better arguments; but this he did to amu&s;e other religious &s;ocieties, and to turn their attention from the common danger.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e, for argument &s;ake, that this e&s;tabli&s;hment was projected, is this a good rea&s;on why the Anatomi&s;t &s;hould &s;hake his bloody knife, and puff and abu&s;e the Presbyterians? Is it a &s;ufficient rea&s;on to threaten then, with a re&s;i&s;tance far different from what is in his paper, po&s;&s;ibly he intends pro&s;ecutions, and fines, and impri&s;onments, and bani&s;hment, and confi&s;cation of goods as in old times. Is every attempt to have an e&s;tabli&s;h|ment &s;ufficient provocation to <HI>re&s;i&s;t even unto blood.</HI> Let us then turn his arguments again&s;t him&s;elf, and a&s;k what &s;hould other &s;ocieties do to prevent an epi&s;copal e&s;tabli&s;hment, that dreadful evil, &s;o ruinous to every other religious denomination, when it comes to be determined that it &s;hall take place among us. Are we accu&s;ed and threatened for writing again&s;t it, and pointing out the direful con&s;equences of a well-known e&s;tabli&s;h|ment,
<PB N="69" REF="011212_0035_0F862D0ACE1BD100">which has already by its cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts per&s;ecuted and oppre&s;&s;ed thou&s;ands of loyal &s;ubjects, and &s;incere Chri&s;tians, and driven many to &s;eek habitations in a howling wilderne&s;s. He and his party threaten to <HI>&s;trive</HI> even to blood, to prevent a Pre&s;|byterian e&s;tabli&s;hment, which is impo&s;&s;ible to accompli&s;h; and yet he will not allow others even to lament their dan|ger from his projected, and almo&s;t executed e&s;tabli&s;hment, nor to complain that they are in danger. All denominations are loudly or humbly to petition tho&s;e that are in power and autho|rity to prevent this evil. But how mu&s;t the world dete&s;t a per|&s;ecuting Church, or a Churchman threatning blood and &s;laugh|ter to any that would aim at an e&s;tabli&s;hment, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ough it be a thing that he, and almo&s;t all epi&s;copalians contend for, as for a ble&s;&s;ing to a religious &s;ociety. This is not the Chri&s;tian &s;pirit; this is not to obey his commands, who enjoins us to do to others as we would be done by.</P>
<P>The Centinel was as much an advocate for every &s;ociety in the colonies as the Presbyterians, yet they and the New-Eng|land Independents only mu&s;t bear the la&s;h of this writer. What has the New-England Independents to do with this controver&s;y? If they dealt hardly by the mi&s;&s;ionaries or the people of their per&s;uation, we would by no means vindicate them, but will this pretended abu&s;e warrant Epi&s;copalian, to unite in England and America, once more to harra&s;s the world with their eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts? If the fir&s;t &s;ettlers in New-England were unfriendly to the Epi&s;copalians and other denominations, they imported the bitter root of per&s;ecution and intolerance, and a love of religi|gious e&s;tabli&s;hments from England to Bo&s;ton, and under the&s;e unhappy prejudices enacted, that other denominations &s;hould contribute to the &s;upport of the e&s;tabli&s;hed or town mini&s;ter: This crying iniquity was done, and &s;till is done in England be|fore the face of all I&s;rael, and in the face of the &s;un. For there all other denominations mu&s;t, and do maintain the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed clergy. But when the Epi&s;copalians had their own mea&s;ures returned, what clamours did they rai&s;e? What cries of inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion? The bi&s;hops and zealous highfliers interpo&s;ed for their relief, and the New-England Independents were told, that notwith&s;tanding their acts of a&s;&s;embly, every denomination mu&s;t maintain their own clergy. And this ju&s;t and equitable determination, beyond the Atlantic, we, and the In|dependents them&s;elves highly approve; but is this equity and ju&s;tice ob&s;erved in Old England, where near a million of Di&s;&s;ent|ers mu&s;t maintain the e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy? Is this equity and ju&s;tice regarded in the epi&s;copal colonies, as in Maryland or Virginia? Or is this equity and ju&s;tice ob&s;erved in North Caro|lina,
<PB N="70" REF="011212_0036_0F862D0B246F4928">where Governor Dobbs obtained &s;evere and oppre&s;&s;ive laws to maintain the epi&s;copal clergy? In the&s;e ca&s;es there are no cries of inju&s;tice, no advocates to plead the cau&s;e of other &s;oci|eties, that are burdened and oppre&s;&s;ed. And all &s;uch acts, when once confirmed in England, are not likely ever to be repealed. The Independents in New-England were led by the practices and laws of Old England to treat Di&s;&s;enters from their e&s;ta|bli&s;hment &s;uch as it was, in the &s;ame manner the epi&s;copalians did, and &s;till do treat Di&s;&s;enters from their religious e&s;tabli&s;h|ments. Of all men in the world they &s;hould be the la&s;t to con|demn others, for what they ju&s;tify in them&s;elves. We condemn all per&s;ecution &s;everity and inju&s;tice in all e&s;tabli&s;hments, whe|ther Roman Catholic, Epi&s;copal, Independent, or Presbyteri|an. But what have we to do with the&s;e affairs in New Eng|land, or with their pre&s;ent debate with the mi&s;&s;ionaries? Is it an attack on the Church of England, to di&s;pute with a few of her mi&s;&s;ionaries; or is it unlawful to write again&s;t her bigotted &s;ons, who contend for an unbroken &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, a divine right of epi&s;copacy, and other chimaeras that are de&s;pi&s;ed by the be&s;t and mo&s;t moderate part of that Church? Are her mi&s;&s;ionaries &s;o fa|cred that all Presbyterians in America mu&s;t be abu&s;ed, becau&s;e Mr. Smith, a Presbyterian hi&s;torian, has omitted to give one of them a full compliment of prai&s;es? What have all the&s;e tri|fles to do with the pre&s;ent di&s;pute? They &s;olve none of our ob|jections; they are only de&s;igned to draw our attention from a gathering &s;torm, ready to bur&s;t on us and de&s;troy us.</P>
<P>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts like a furious wild bea&s;t are at pre&s;ent un|der re&s;traints, but are not tamed. They have in &s;ome degree maintained their influence, even under the milder admini&s;tration, &s;ince the glorious revolution; and if an epi&s;copate be here e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, we fear they will rage with &s;even &s;old &s;ury. One great rea&s;on of our fear, ari&s;es from the nature and con&s;titution of the&s;e colonies. In England, the nobility in general hate op|pre&s;&s;ion, and have on many occa&s;ions checked the exorbitant power of eccle&s;ia&s;ticks, and delivered their friends, tenants and religious &s;ocieties, from per&s;ecution. The judges in England, are men of great reputation and influence; they are rai&s;ed a|bove the frowns of the proude&s;t eccle&s;ia&s;ticks, nay they are &s;et above the pride or malice even of the King's mini&s;ters, that they may without danger, adhere to the laws, and defend the rights of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> people. They are empowered to grant, and do frequently grant prohibitions to check the tyranny, and to &s;top the rigour of the bi&s;hops courts. But &s;hould epi&s;copacy with its courts be here e&s;tabli&s;hed, (and that they certainly will be e&s;tabli&s;hed is what we fear) we have no powerful nobility to
<PB N="71" REF="011212_0036_0F862D0B246F4928">check their rage, no independent judges e&s;tabli&s;hed for life to interpo&s;e and deliver us. A judge, or even a governor in the colonies, would be treated with in&s;olence and abu&s;e, that would appear again&s;t the oppre&s;&s;ion of any of our proud unmerciful prelates, mo&s;t bitter complaints of his conduct would be made to the Arch-bi&s;hops and Bi&s;hops and the King's mini&s;ters. He would be traduced as a republican, an enemy to the church of England, and to his Maje&s;ty's government in the colonies and to Monarchy it&s;elf. The old cry would be rai&s;ed again, no Bi|&s;hops, no King, and po&s;&s;ibly the offender, whether Judge or Governor, would be rumbled down with di&s;grace from his &s;tation, and made an example to all who would not bow down their necks, to our American Bi&s;hops. Let me on this occa&s;ion, u&s;e the words of the Anatomi&s;ts, <HI>O my children, on the pro&s;pect of this change, how I tremble and lament for you!</HI></P>
<P>How carefully has the Anatomi&s;t raked up every thing to blacken the Independents in New England; even the Bo&s;ton Alma|nack is pre&s;&s;ed into his &s;ervice. But do the&s;e &s;hifts and eva&s;ions &s;atisfy any rea&s;onable man, that the intended epi&s;copate will not be hurtful to other religious &s;ocieties? or that it will not in|troduce confu&s;ion, into our civil courts, and overturn many of our laws? Does a &s;tory of Independent Reflectors, and Watch Towers, or of a Hi&s;torian, that did not extol one of their Mi&s;&s;ionaries as much as he de&s;erved and expected, prove that the Presbyterians are labouring for an e&s;tabli&s;hment? Our granting that they were, which is a notorious fal&s;hood, would that con|vince us that our civil and religious liberties were in no danger from the intended epi&s;copate and its eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts? If he thinks it any advantage to his cau&s;e, to mention the faults of Presbyterians and Independents, who were ever as moderate in the exerci&s;e of power as the church of England; we are ready to balance accounts with him, and our accounts of the &s;everi|ties of the Highfliers in the church of England, and their &s;e|vere acts of Parliament to di&s;tre&s;s all non conformi&s;ts, &s;hall not be taken from almanacks, pamplets, or unprinted hi&s;tories, but from Hi&s;torians of undoubted Authority and good reputation.

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><P>Let the <HI>Ma&s;tiffs</HI> amu&s;e them&s;elves about a <HI>&s;heep-&s;kin</HI> &s;tuffed with hay, provided it will keep them from worrying the flock.</P>
<BIBL><HI>SWIFT.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT was hinted in my introductory number, that "in the character of the <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> which the <HI>Centinel</HI> and his a&s;&s;oci|ates have drawn, they have been combating a phantom of their own brain;" and, therefore, I &s;hould have con&s;idered them in the ca&s;e of the <HI>ma&s;tiffs</HI> mentioned in my <HI>motto,</HI> viz. as "amu&s;ing them&s;elves about a <HI>&s;heep-&s;kin</HI> &s;tuffed with hay," pro|vided they had not fallen foul of the <HI>flock,</HI> and attacked the whole body of the Churh, her doctrine, and di&s;cipline, and the principles of her clergy and members. For what le&s;s can be meant by a&s;&s;erting, <Q>that the pure word of God is corrupted and ob&s;cured among us with human inventions; and that our clergy are exerting their utmo&s;t influence in conjunction with Mr. Grenville, to en&s;lave America; that the Bi&s;hop we want, would be dangerous to liberty,</Q>&mdash;and &s;uch like expre&s;&s;ions, fairly quoted from the Centinel?</P>
<P>It was ob&s;erved in the &s;econd number, "that the common apology made by the <HI>Centinel</HI>'s adherents, for this illiberal and unmanly abu&s;e of the Church, is, that Dr. <HI>Chandler</HI> was the ag|gre&s;&s;or." But to this it was an&s;wered, and no one hath offered to deny the truth of the a&s;&s;ertion,&mdash;"that Doctor <HI>Chandler</HI> far from being an aggre&s;&s;or, hath not uttered a &s;ingle word, in his whole performance, reflecting on the principles of any pro|te&s;tant per&s;ua&s;ion of men; and therefore nothing done by him could be the lea&s;t plea for an attack on the Church in general."</P>
<P>That this matter might be more clear to every impartial rea|der, I have even gone more than a century back and have &s;hewn that the oppo&s;ition to the Church of England in America, on the part of the Presbyterians and Independents, has been car|ried on through that long period of time, with &s;uch uniformity of bitterne&s;s, and inextingui&s;hable malignity, as could flow from nothing le&s;s than a rooted de&s;ire of cru&s;hing the Church wholly on this continent, for the &s;ake of erecting an exclu&s;ive dominion of their own.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="011212_0037_0F862D0BE649AE78">Some in&s;tances, out of many, have been given, of their un|chri&s;tian endeavours to prevent his Maje&s;ty's good &s;ubjects &s;ettled among them from enjoying the free exerci&s;e of that mode of re|ligious wor&s;hip which their con&s;ciences directed them to follow.

And to the whole have been added &s;ome examples of the hideous characters in which the Church, her Bi&s;hops &amp;c. have been painted, as pur&s;uing &s;chemes danger|ous to American liberty, and the like; all which our antagoni&s;ts help out with prayers, as well in their publications as pulpits, that Bi&s;hops may never get footing here, nor the <HI>Church gain ground to any great degree</HI>&mdash;a conduct too evidently calcu|lated to prejudice and enflame the minds of their followers, not only again&s;t their <HI>epi&s;copal</HI> brethren in America, but (I wi&s;h it could not be &s;aid) to alienate their affections from the con&s;titu|tion of the mother country. Nay, &s;o far gone are they in their domineering uncharitable &s;pirit, that even our &s;ecret wi&s;hes are con&s;trued into crimes; and our humble <HI>petitions</HI> to our &s;ove|reign and &s;uperiors in the Church, <HI>praying</HI> that we may be ad|admitted to the natural rights enjoyed by all other religious &s;o|cieties, are &s;aid to be deep laid plots, ready to break forth into every evil, political and religious, which their <HI>fertile</HI> imagina|tions can invent.</P>
<P>This is no exaggerated account of the treatment which the Church hath met with in America; but is much &s;hort of what might have been &s;aid under this head.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>In the review of the treatment which the Church hath met with from different writers in America, I have for the &s;ake of brevity, omitted the virulent pieces of</HI> Hobart, <HI>and many others, in Connecticut, as well as in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and other northern governments. But the &s;pecimens I have given will &s;hew the</HI> Centinel <HI>to be but an humble retailer of antiquated &s;candal.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>It is therefore &s;ubmitted to the impartial world to declare, whether.

<PB N="74" REF="011212_0038_0F862D0CA56CF690">endeavour, in the &s;pirit of meekne&s;s, to &s;tate our ca&s;e, and en|deavour to convince the&s;e our intolerant antagoni&s;ts that we a&s;k nothing, and wi&s;h nothing which, on the principles of equi|ty, law, and the con&s;titution, can rea&s;onably be denied us? Doctor <HI>Chandler</HI> declared this to be the de&s;ign of his Appeal, and tells the world, that, "as &s;ome per&s;ons were &s;aid to be a|larmed at the application made by the clergy in &s;everal colonies for one or more Bi&s;hops to be &s;ent to America, he thought it proper to &s;hew <HI>candidly</HI> and <HI>explicitly</HI> for what rea&s;ons this appli|cation had been made, and that no inva&s;ion of the civil or reli|gious privileges of any, whether Churchmen or Di&s;&s;enters, was thereby intended. And if any thing &s;hould appear to be le&s;s fitly &s;poken, or not clearly evidenced, he reque&s;ts notice of it in a charitable and Chri&s;tian way, declaring farther, "that the per&s;on who &s;hould act thus to him, &s;hould be as welcome to him as an angel of God, &s;ent to conduct him from the lanes of error into the open ways of truth?"</P>
<P>But has the <HI>Centinel</HI> acted like this angel of God? Or rather hath he not acted, (let the impartial world &s;ay) like an angel of a different complexion, in turning from a charitable and Chri&s;tian an&s;wer to Dr. <HI>Chandler,</HI> into a mo&s;t uncharitable and unchri&s;tian attack of the whole body of the Church, whereof he is a Member? The <HI>Doctor</HI> had a number of antagoni&s;ts up|on him from the northern governments, who were boa&s;ted to be more than his match. What need then of our Centinel's in|terfering, unle&s;s it was to &s;hew his pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne&s;s and dexterity of <HI>apeing Mayhew,</HI> and others; or perhaps, to have the fir&s;t merit of introducing this di&s;pute into Penn&s;ylvania, where all had &s;o long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in harmony and <HI>brotherly</HI> love between Church|men and Pre&s;byterians? Or was it intended, by bringing the di&s;pute into this &s;outhern latitude, to make the world believe that the northern <HI>contagion</HI> and intolerant raving again&s;t epi&s;copacy, was become general through all <HI>America?</HI></P>
<P>Which ever of the&s;e was our Centinel's motive, he mu&s;t now take the con&s;equences; for having, I think, fully fini&s;hed the fir&s;t head, and &s;hewn that Dr. Chandler was not an aggre&s;&s;or in this di&s;pute, much le&s;s any member of the Church in Penn|&s;ylvania. I &s;hall come to clo&s;e quarters with the <HI>Centinel.</HI> But I own my&s;elf at &s;ome lo&s;s how to deal with &s;uch an eccentric ad|ver&s;ary&mdash;for, as Mon&s;ieur Bayle ob&s;erves upon the like oc|ca&s;ion; it is like hunting a <HI>duck,</HI> which as &s;oon as you think you have her, dives down, and leaves you &s;taring about to &s;ee where &s;he will pop up again.

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>While I am pur&s;uing this <HI>erratic &s;cribbler</HI> through all his mazes and turnings, I pray, Mr. <HI>Remon&s;trant,</HI> Mr. <HI>Irenicus,</HI> Mr. <HI>Anti-Centinel,</HI> and others his auxiliaries, not to bear too hard upon me, by &s;tanding and cuffing me behind bu&s;hes, and at eve|ry corner. It is unmanly Indian-like war; for, whil&s;t I am en|gaged with &s;uch a mighty champion as the <HI>Centinel,</HI> I cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed able to &s;pare his auxiliaries more than a <HI>back blow</HI> now and then.</P>
<P>The <HI>Remon&s;trant,</HI> No, II. not content with what the Cen|tinel has &s;aid about per&s;ecution, lays before the Quakers, from their own hi&s;tory by <HI>Sewell,</HI> which mo&s;t of them have in their hands, a petition to the King, &s;etting forth many hard&s;hips and &s;ufferings they laboured under; and threatens the <HI>Anatomi&s;t</HI> with reviving the memory of many more &s;uch tran&s;actions. The <HI>Re|mon&s;trant</HI> may u&s;e his plea&s;ure in this; for the members of the <HI>Church</HI> have nothing to fear from his utmo&s;t efforts. The hi&s;to|ry of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> is part of the hi&s;tory of the nation, and where &s;he hath done ami&s;s, the Quakers can as well di&s;tin|gui&s;h as the <HI>Remon&s;trant</HI> or any of his party; and therefore, he will not be able to tell <HI>them</HI> or <HI>us</HI> any thing that is new. But many of the per&s;ecutions by his party, which (if forced to it) we can &s;et in the balance, have been carried on in low and barbarous ob&s;curity&mdash;and for the &s;ake of Religion, I would be unwilling to drag them into light.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, &s;ince the Church has been charged with per&s;e|cution, it was intended (If I could be permitted to proceed re|gularly) to di&s;tingui&s;h the period before the <HI>act</HI> of <HI>toleration,</HI> from that after it. In the former period the principles of civil liberty were perhaps as little fixed as tho&s;e of religious liberty; and where the Church erred in the execution of the laws, by which &s;he was &s;ecured, it was with far le&s;s &s;avagene&s;s of man|ner, and fanat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">c barbarity, than were exerci&s;ed by our accu&s;ers during the &s;ame period. Again, &s;ince the <HI>toleration-act,</HI> &s;carce an in&s;tance can be given wherein both the &s;pirit and letter of the
<PB N="76" REF="011212_0039_0F862D0D7902BDE8">act have not been inviolably ob&s;erved on the part of the Church; and that not as matter of con&s;traint on the Bi&s;hops, but from an examplary &s;pirit of moderation and Chri&s;tian charity; where|as, on the other hand, during the &s;ame period, our antagoni&s;ts have too often &s;hewn, where they had power, that their &s;pirit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ath not mended with the &s;pirit of the laws, but &s;till continues <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e &s;ame in the pre&s;ent day even to the mad zeal of <HI>knocking in head,</HI> where other means might fail.</P>
<P>And here, <HI>I could &s;uch a tale unfold</HI>&mdash;But I content my|&s;elf with acting on the <HI>defen&s;ive;</HI> and &s;ince the <HI>Remon&s;trant</HI> has given one petition of the Quakers to the King, I will give ano|ther, and let him &s;ay what he will again&s;t the <HI>Church,</HI> I have &s;ufficient materials &s;till to balance the account with him.</P>
<P>The petition I mean, is that of the Quakers, to <HI>Charles</HI> II. 1669, complaining of the intolerable per&s;ecutions they &s;uffered by the <HI>&s;anguinary</HI> laws of <HI>New-England;</HI> when, after enume|rating &s;ome of their &s;ufferings under <HI>Cromwell's</HI> u&s;urpation, they proceed thus.</P>
<P><Q>And now, O King, &s;ince the very day the Lord brought thee into thy land again, and gave thee thy land again, and gave thee thy regal power, have they in thy name, made &s;trange and cruel havock of thy true &s;ubjects, in putting to death and bani&s;hing: And in thy name, with many torturing whippings of old and young at po&s;ts, and at wheels of great guns, and at carts tails, dragging the naked bodies of parents and children through divers long towns, through the filth and dirt of their channels and cart-ways.

The&s;e few lines are written not from any defire of the lea&s;t revenge from thy hand upon them, but that thou maye&s;t know it, and make known thy di&s;like of their wickedne&s;s, that &s;o the blood of the innocent might not be laid to thy charge in the terrible day of the Lord.</Q>

<P>I come now to that part of my undertaking, in which the <HI>Centinel</HI>'s adherents )by their repeated challenges) &s;eem to think I &s;hall be chiefly pre&s;&s;ed.&mdash;I mean, in an&s;wering his arguments "on the danger of introducing (or, as they phra&s;e it, <HI>importing</HI>) a Bi&s;hop, or Bi&s;hops to <HI>America.</HI>"&mdash;And, I confe&s;s, I have no &s;mall difficulties to encounter with. For,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t, What he &s;ays on this head lies &s;o &s;cattered through his different papers, that, after wading through all of them, I
<PB N="78" REF="011212_0040_0F862D0E226EC9F0">find it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ort what I glean up, into any kind of form or connection.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, After this pains, which I have taken without any de|&s;ire of mangleing or weakening what he has advanced, I can meet with &s;carce any thing that wears the &s;emblance of <HI>ar|gument.</HI></P>
<P>It would, indeed, be a plea&s;ure, while we claim what we think a <HI>natural right,</HI> to be in&s;trumental in removing the apprehen&s;i|ons which any &s;incere and candid man may entertain from our pro&s;ecution of that claim. But, when called on to rea&s;on with a man, who will neither tru&s;t the <HI>faith of nations,</HI> the <HI>&s;anctity of laws and charters,</HI> nor any <HI>human &s;ecurity</HI> what&s;oever, but will &s;till cry out&mdash;<HI>"danger, &s;lavery, per&s;ecution"</HI>&mdash; I find my&s;elf in the &s;ituation of <HI>one</HI> who fooli&s;hly undertook to rea&s;on a man into his &s;en&s;es, who&s;e imagination was continual|ly haunted with <HI>gho&s;ts</HI> and <HI>hobgoblins.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>"Come, &s;ays he, who undertook this work, &s;hew me the chamber where they are&mdash;For GOD's &s;ake, replies the other, enter not in. See how it &s;tares!

And thus might the dialogue pro|ceed for ever, without conviction on the part of the poor di&s;tem|pered man.</P>
<P>That I am doing no inju&s;tice to what is called the <HI>Centinel</HI>'s "arguments," I hope to &s;hew to every candid reader. I &s;hall, therefore, endeavour, with the utmo&s;t impartiality, to gather them into one view.</P>
<P><Q>There are grounds, he &s;ays, to &s;u&s;pect that Dr. <HI>Chandler</HI> has not given the plan on which Bi&s;hops are to be &s;ent to <HI>America,</HI> with that openne&s;s and candor that might have been expected.&mdash;It is <HI>plain, beyond a contradiction,</HI> that the defire of the Mi&s;&s;ionaries is to have &s;uch &s;uffragan Bi&s;hops IMPORTED into <HI>America,</HI> as &s;hall have authority to exerci&s;e all the powers given THEM
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>If this confu&s;ed &s;entence has any meaning, it mu&s;t be the following, and an&s;wers it&s;elf, viz.

<PB N="79" REF="011212_0040_0F862D0E226EC9F0">a Bi&s;hop in <HI>America,</HI> who has already "powers by the laws of <HI>England,</HI>" yet No. 11, and el&s;ewhere, he intimates, that they want to introduce him by an act of Parliament," and new laws. In &s;hort, he takes it for granted all along (for it would be need|le&s;s to quote particular papers, becau&s;e, if he denies this, we have no conte&s;t) that the de&s;ign of the Epi&s;copal Clergy is a general e&s;tabli&s;hment, as in <HI>England,</HI> through all <HI>America;</HI> that the &s;ending out a Bi&s;hop is an e&s;tabli&s;hment of him&s;elf, as well as his Clergy; that whatever may be pretended, he mu&s;t have juri&s;diction over the laity; that <HI>arbitrary &s;piritual courts</HI> mu&s;t in&s;eparably accompany him, &amp;c. <Q>The laity, &s;ays he, are amu&s;ed with the fal&s;e and incon&s;i&s;tent hopes of being en|tirely exempted from the juri&s;diction of the <HI>American</HI> Bi&s;hop. We call it an incon&s;i&s;tent hope, as it is contradictory, not on|ly to the known &s;entiments of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Epi&s;copal Church, but al&s;o to the &s;entiments of every other Chri&s;tian Church in the World. This plan of <HI>American</HI> Bi&s;hops is a mere <HI>novel invention,</HI> without any parallel in hi&s;tory, &s;ince the fir&s;t e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of a Church upon earth.</Q></P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, this con&s;i&s;tent writer, No. 15, "wonders at tho&s;e who have no idea of a Bi&s;hop &s;eparate from the appen|dages of the office;"&mdash;but &s;till, when he finds Dr. <HI>Chandler</HI> has this idea as well as him&s;elf, and &s;peaks of a Bi&s;hop without the appendage of <HI>&s;piritual courts,</HI> he cries out&mdash;"What is this, but to &s;ay, that an <HI>arbitrary &s;piritual juri&s;diction,</HI> un|known in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> con&s;titution, and abhorre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t of the rights of freemen, is a&s;ked, and about to be e&s;tabli&s;hed in <HI>America?</HI>" He kindly adds, "Alas! for the <HI>poor Clergy!</HI>" Indeed the Clergy are <HI>once</HI> obliged to him for his pity; but they did not need it here. For Dr. <HI>Chandler</HI> has &s;aid in the &s;ame &s;entence, and the <HI>Centinel</HI> has quoted the words, that the Clergy are not to be governed arbitrarily, but "by laws and canons of the Church," clear and explicit in them&s;elves, which the Clergy have voluntarily bound them&s;elves to obey, and which may be executed in re&s;pect to them, without any juri&s;diction over the laity, becau&s;e &s;uch juri&s;diction, as I &s;hall fully &s;hew, is derived
<PB N="80" REF="011212_0041_0F862D13EF31B9E0">from other laws, that neither have, nor are de&s;ired to have, any place here.</P>
<P>The&s;e few "arguments" of the <HI>Centinel,</HI> will be &s;ufficient, till I try whether they can be an&s;wered. Others &s;hall be quo|ted in their proper place; only it may not be ami&s;s to &s;hew, be|fore I begin, how, in tho&s;e already quoted, he is explained and helped out by his a&s;&s;ociates, the <HI>Remon&s;trant,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;who tell us, "that there is a gathering &s;torm ready to bur&s;t on them, and fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;troy them;" that they <HI>fear</HI> "Epi&s;copacy, and its courts, will certainly be e&s;tabli&s;hed together; and that all judges and governors, who will not bow their necks to <HI>American</HI> Bi&s;hops, will be tumbled down with di&s;grace from their &s;tations."&mdash; And then we hear of "LAUD, and <HI>Per&s;ecutions,</HI> and flying once more to the wilderne&s;s, as their FATHERS did;" for it &s;eems every writer now adays had <HI>fathers,</HI> and can count his pe|digree back to the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of <HI>America!</HI></P>
<P>Having thus cut out my work, the que&s;tion is, where to be|gin; for I have not a <HI>&s;ingle &s;pectre</HI> to lay, but am &s;urrounded with them.&mdash;<Q>"GORGONS, and HYDRAS, and CHIMERAS dire!"</Q></P>
<P>I will begin then, at a venture; for it makes little odds where. The <HI>Centinel</HI>'s main argument &s;eems to be&mdash;that "eccle|&s;ia&s;tical courts, and &s;lavery, and per&s;ecutions," are a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of the introduction of <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> into <HI>America;</HI> and I am called on to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hew that his apprehen&s;ions on this head are not well grounded. Hard it is to prove a <HI>negative,</HI> but in all fair argument, I &s;hall do what may be equally &s;atisfactory, if I prove this <HI>affirmative,</HI>&mdash;viz.&mdash;that it is <HI>po&s;&s;ible,</HI> and even certain, that a Bi&s;hop can be &s;ettled in <HI>America,</HI> without affecting the civil or religious rights of any per&s;on what&s;oever; and that every pre&s;umption that can be adduced to the contra|ry, would milita<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e equally again&s;t every in&s;titution in &s;ociety, even down to the appointment of a petty con&s;table. And I will engage to &s;hew much greater &s;ecurity again&s;t any arbitrary proceedings on the part of a Bi&s;hop, than I think our antagoni&s;t will be able to &s;hew on the part of &s;uch &s;elf-made, and &s;elf-de|legated things, as <HI>Synods, Pre&s;byteries,</HI> and <HI>Kirk-Se&s;&s;ions, in America.</HI></P>
<P>However ungenerou&s;ly the <HI>Centinel</HI> has been plea&s;ed to tra|duce the Epi&s;copal Clergy of <HI>America,</HI> as in a con&s;piracy with <HI>B&mdash;te</HI> and <HI>Gr&mdash;n&mdash;lle,</HI> to <HI>en&s;lave</HI> their country; however ba&s;ely he has a&s;&s;ociated attempts for an <HI>American</HI> Bi&s;hop with plans of rebellion, and the introduction of Popery, and the Pretender; however wickedly he has endeavoured to prejudice the vulgar, by jumbling our claim of natural right to the pri|vileges
<PB N="81" REF="011212_0041_0F862D13EF31B9E0">of a <HI>Chri&s;tian Church,</HI> with odious <HI>Stamp-Acts,</HI> and arbitrary <HI>Courts of Admiralty,</HI> yet I am bold to &s;ay, that if the Epi&s;co|pal Clergy did not clearly &s;ee, and firmly believe, that what they a&s;k is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with their own rights, and tho&s;e of the laity, they would dete&s;t the thoughts of becoming in&s;tru|ments in the ruin of their country. For what motive could in|duce them to &s;uch a conduct? Surely the pre&s;ent &s;ett of Mini|&s;ters can expect little per&s;onal benefit from any &s;cheme of this kind. And they are not <HI>Anchorites,</HI> without children, nor wholly without property; nor is their prie&s;thood, like the <HI>Levi|tical,</HI> to de&s;cend from father to &s;on.</P>
<P>Surely then this abu&s;ive writer &s;hould have &s;ome &s;olid foun|dations for &s;uch a horrible charge again&s;t the Clergy, as that of &s;hewing one &s;cheme to the world "<HI>plau&s;ible,</HI> &s;pecious, and calculated to amu&s;e with incon&s;i&s;tent hopes," while the real one lies concealed under it, pregnant with every po&s;&s;ible mi&s;chief.&mdash; Let us &s;ee what tho&s;e foundations are.&mdash;</P>
<P>He &s;ays, <Q>the exemption of the laity from the juri&s;diction of the Bi&s;hop is contradictory, not only to the known &s;entiments of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> but of every other Chri&s;tian Church in the world&mdash;and is a mere novel invention, without any parallel in hi&s;tory, &s;ince the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of a Church on earth.</Q></P>
<P>Now both the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions I utterly deny; and if the <HI>Centinel</HI> was in earne&s;t in them, or meant any thing more than to im|po&s;e on the ignorant, he mu&s;t give me leave to pronounce him wholly unacquainted with <HI>Church-hi&s;tory,</HI> as well as the con|&s;titution of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> and the foundation of that temporal juri&s;diction, with which it has been thought proper to ve&s;t her Bi&s;hops.</P>
<P>What meaning the <HI>Centinel</HI> de&s;igns to have put on the words &mdash;"&s;ince the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of a Church on earth."&mdash; I know not. For he often writes, as if he cho&s;e to keep a back|door for an e&s;cape, in ca&s;e of detection. But if CHRIST can be &s;aid to have e&s;tabli&s;hed a Church on earth, or if there was a Chri&s;tian Church during the three fir&s;t centuries, then there were Bi&s;hops during that period, &s;uch as we de&s;ire for <HI>America,</HI> that had no juri&s;diction over the laity, different from what every Pre&s;byter had, as e&s;&s;ential to the office of a pa&s;tor.</P>
<P>I &s;hall give an authority for this, which will not be denied. It is the learned and accurate Civilian BURN.&mdash;For the fir&s;t 300 years after CHRIST (he &s;ays) the di&s;tinction of eccle&s;ia&s;|tical and &s;piritual cau&s;es, in point of juri&s;diction, did not be|gin. At that time, no &s;uch di&s;tinction was heard of, in the Chri&s;tian world. For the cau&s;es of te&s;timony, matrimony,
<PB N="82" REF="011212_0042_0F862D14B7CE8B78">ba&s;tardy, adultery, and the re&s;t, which are called eccle&s;ia&s;tical or &s;piritual cau&s;es, were merely civil, and determined by the rules of the civil law, and &s;ubject only to the juri&s;diction of the civil magi&s;trate."</P>
<P>What has BEEN, is <HI>po&s;&s;ible</HI> to BE again; and the &s;ame author proceeds to &s;hew how Bi&s;hops came to have juri&s;diction over the laity, even in cau&s;es called &s;piritual; which were never claimed as inherent in their &s;piritual character, or derived from CHRIST; but given by the powers then in <HI>being,</HI> for what they e&s;teemed &s;alutary purpo&s;es.</P>
<P><Q>Chri&s;tian Emperors, &s;ays he, out of a zeal to grace and honour learned and godly Bi&s;hops, were plea&s;ed to <HI>&s;ingle out</HI> certain cau&s;es, wherein they granted them juri&s;diction,&mdash; viz. in ca&s;e of <HI>tithes,</HI> becau&s;e paid to the men of the Church; in cau&s;es of matrimony, becau&s;e marriages were, for the mo&s;t part, &s;olemnized in the Church; in cau&s;es te&s;tamentary, be|cau&s;e te&s;taments were many times made <HI>in extremis,</HI> when Churchmen were pre&s;ent giving &s;piritual comfort;&mdash;and in all the&s;e cau&s;es, the Bi&s;hops proceeded according to the im|perial law, and as the civil magi&s;trate did in other cau&s;es.</Q> Who then will &s;ay that they a&s;&s;umed this juri&s;diction, as in&s;e|parable from their office, or that it was arbitrary, or could have been exerci&s;ed without law?</P>
<P>In the &s;ame manner did the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bi&s;hops derive juri&s;dicti|on over the laity, in certain cau&s;es eccle&s;ia&s;tical. It is no doc|trine of our Church, as the <HI>Centinel</HI> would a&s;&s;ert, that they hold it in&s;eparable from their office, and immediately of CHRIST. This proud boa&s;t is indeed made by Independents and Pre&s;byte|rians, tho' they have never yet produced their charter. But the latter, I mean the Pre&s;byterians, in the <HI>new</HI> national Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> hold this doctrine with much as bad a grace, as they accu&s;e our Church of Sham-elections, dictated by the King's <HI>Conge d'Elire.</HI> For though the General A&s;&s;embly of the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> pretend that they meet yearly with CHRIST as their head, and from him alone derive their authority to determine cau&s;es, civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical, yet the King, by his Commi&s;&s;i|oner, &s;its at lea&s;t as their vi&s;ible head, and when in his royal prerogative, he thinks fit to adjourn them to a certain day, they always find (and good worldly wi&s;dom it is) that CHRIST approves of what the King has done, and they adjourn them|&s;elves to the &s;ame day accordingly.</P>
<P>Having already tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the bounds allotted me by my publi&s;hers, I &s;hall, in my next, re&s;ume this &s;ubject, and &s;how, by full authorities, that the propo&s;ed plan for <HI>American</HI> Bi&s;hops,
<PB N="83" REF="011212_0042_0F862D14B7CE8B78">&s;imply as it &s;tands, is no <HI>novel invention,</HI> nor any way con|tradictory to the known &s;entiments of the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>

<HEAD>From the PENNSYLVANIA JOURNAL, Nov. 3. THE REMONSTRANT, No. IV.</HEAD>
<P>THE Anatomi&s;t, and his friend Horatio, have r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ked toge|ther ab&s;tracts of pamphlets, written in the New-England provinces, from which they have picked an expre&s;&s;ion, here and there, which they di&s;like; and having dre&s;&s;ed it in Italicks, and double commas, they cry out, that the whole performances are written with a bitter intolerant &s;pirit. If in their contro|ver&s;ies&punc; with any of the Mi&s;&s;ionaries, the Independent Mini&s;ters have &s;et the vain preten&s;ions of the&s;e gentlemen, to an uninter|rupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and the power which their Church claims to ordain or decree rites and ceremonies, &amp;c. in a true light, there is a loud outcry rai&s;ed, that they attack the whole body of the Church, her doctrine and di&s;cipline, and the principles of her clergy and members. Is it &s;o rotten a fabrick, that it cannot bear to be touched? A Church that is &s;o very tender, &s;hould give no provocation. But does any of the&s;e quotations prove that the Independents would have cru&s;hed the Church of En|gland, or that they were the fir&s;t aggre&s;&s;ors in any of the&s;e de|bates? No, it is well known that the Epi&s;copal Mi&s;&s;ionaries, or their friends, fir&s;t proclaimed the war, and when <HI>they</HI> were foundly drubbed, they would make the world believe, that the whole Church of England has been too roughly handled; but what have the&s;e &s;quabbles to do with <HI>Chandler</HI>'s Appeal? Eve|ry colony, and religious denomination, are equally called forth by that champion for an American Epi&s;copate. They are to make their objections, if they have any, or all parties are &s;up|po&s;ed to acquie&s;ce in his plan.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Epi&s;copal Church &s;et up among the Independents in New-England, was about the year 1680. They were poor, and few in number, and were allowed the u&s;e of the Town-hou&s;e by the Independents, as he calls the Congregational Churches. Was not this an in&s;tance of brotherly love? It was an evidence of no malignity of &s;pirit, or a de&s;ire to cru&s;h them. But how did they requite this kindne&s;s <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Vindication of New-England, Pages</HI> 13, 14. <HI>Life of Dr. Cotton Mather, Page</HI> 43. <HI>Hobart's Second Addre&s;s. Pages</HI> 24, 25, 26, 27, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>? Under the
<PB N="84" REF="011212_0043_0F862D14E462BA50">admini&s;tration of Sir Edmund Andro&s;s, they declared that they were the Church of England by law e&s;tabli&s;hed; they would no longer a&s;&s;emble in the Town-hou&s;e, but demanded the keys of the South Meeting-hou&s;e. And when &s;ome gentlemen, proprietors of that hou&s;e, refu&s;ed to deliver them, Governor Andro&s;s told them, <HI>he would pre&s;ently &s;eize on that hou&s;e, and all the Meeting-hou&s;es in the country, and hinder them from con|tributing the value of Two-pence towards the maintenance of any Non conformi&s;t Mini&s;ter.</HI> And when this threatening could not prevail, they thru&s;t them&s;elves into the Meeting hou&s;e, and there continued, until, by interrupting the people of the South Congregation, often in the <HI>times,</HI> and &s;ometimes in the very <HI>parts</HI> of their wor&s;hip&punc; the whole town cried &s;hame upon them. Here was a &s;ample of the &s;ame per&s;ecuting &s;pirit, from which the Independents fled to this wilderne&s;s. At the funeral of one Mr. Lilly, their Mini&s;ter came with his <HI>gown</HI> and <HI>book,</HI> to read the &s;ervice, and to &s;ettle this laudable cu&s;tom in that barbarous country. One Mr. Fray<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, a relation of the decea&s;ed, in the name of the re&s;t, only with fit words, de&s;ired him to forbear; but Mr. Frayray was bound over to the Court for this offence, where they intended to have ruined him, had not the <HI>unlucky Revolution</HI> prevented the&s;e de&s;igns.</P>
<P>And, that the Mini&s;ters might have their &s;hare, Mr. Cotton Mather was pro&s;ecuted upon the <HI>act of Uniformity,</HI> and illegal|ly condemned, but the Revolution prevented the execution of the &s;entence again&s;t him. For on that very day on which he was to be committed <HI>to half a year's impri&s;onment,</HI> tho&s;e that would have wronged him, were ju&s;tly taken into cu&s;tody. This beloved <HI>act of Uniformity,</HI> and the penal laws in &s;upport of it, tore the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church of England to pieces, and brought unnumbered mi&s;chiefs on many of its own Mini&s;ters and people, which it drove from their communion. And this &s;ame <HI>act of Uniformity,</HI> which the Epi&s;copal Church determined to e&s;ta|bli&s;h in New-England, began all tho&s;e controver&s;ies, that the Anatomi&s;t complains of, and it had been for his honour, and for the benefit of his cau&s;e, rather to have let them &s;leep in &s;ilence, than to have &s;o &s;pitefully revived them.</P>
<P>It is urged, that &s;ince the Act of Toleration an exemplary &s;pirit of moderation and Chri&s;tian charity have prevailed among the Epi&s;copalians. For this we thank GOD, and for this we cheerfully prai&s;e, and give them due commendation, as far as they de&s;erve it. But are things really &s;o? Let us remind the Epi&s;copalians of their conduct in New-York, &s;ince the Tole|ration
<PB N="85" REF="011212_0043_0F862D14E462BA50">Act, under the admini&s;tration of Lord Cornbury <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Mr. Makemie's Trial, Page</HI> 17, <HI>and Mr. Hobart's Second Addre&s;s, Pages</HI> 28, 29.</NOTE>. Mr. Makemie, a worthy Pre&s;byterian Mini&s;ter, preached a &s;ermon in New-York, at the de&s;ire of a number of the inhabitants, who were Pre&s;byterians. And though he produced a certificate of his having qualified him&s;elf according to the Act of Toleration, he was committed to pri&s;on, and pro&s;ecuted upon an indictment that &s;ays, <HI>that he unlawfully u&s;ed other rites, ceremonies, form and manner of divine wor&s;hip, than what are contained in a certain book of Common Prayer, and Admini&s;tration of the Sacraments,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>again&s;t the form of the Statute.</HI> &amp;c. Here the attack was vigorou&s;ly begun by the Church of England, a|gain&s;t the Pre&s;byterians, in open defiance of the Act of Tole|ration, and in a city that was originally &s;ettled with Dutch Pre&s;|byterians, and where the Epi&s;copal Church, in its infant &s;tate, had been kindly cheri&s;hed, and had received many favours. Was n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the unmerciful and &s;candalous Schi&s;m Bill, enacted in the la&s;t year of Queen Anne, and enacted in open defiance to the Toleration Act, by which the friends of this <HI>beloved Act of Uniformity</HI> deprived all parents that were not of the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church, of the great tru&s;t committed to them by GOD, and nature, to train up their own children according to their own &s;entiments in religion, and the fear of GOD. No catechi&s;m was to be taught to children, but that of the Church of Eng|land, and no man under &s;evere penalties, was allowed to teach even an Engli&s;h &s;chool, who did not, in all things, con|form to that Church. Let our Anatomi&s;t call this unmerited abu&s;e; it is the truth, and it was done when High Church rode triumphant. And had not GOD in mercy placed the Hano|ver family on the throne of Great Britain, all the &s;everities that di&s;tre&s;&s;ed England for near one hundred years, and ruined ma|ny thou&s;ands of families, had been felt once more, with &s;even|fold rigor.</P>
<P>In Connecticut the Epi&s;copal party carried their preten&s;ions to an e&s;tabli&s;hment in the Plantations, by the Act of Unifor|mity, to a very high pitch. This was urged by Caner and Wetmore, from a principle e&s;tabli&s;hed, as Wetmore &s;aid, by &s;kilful Lawyers, <HI>that colonies tran&s;planting them&s;elves, carry the laws of their mother country with them.</HI> And from the&s;e &s;trug|gles and attempts to e&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves by the Act of Unifor|mity, the world may judge who have been the aggre&s;&s;ors in the&s;e di&s;putes; or whether the Epi&s;copal Churches, or Indepen|dents,
<PB N="86" REF="011212_0044_0F862D15B0641790">who &s;trive to defend their liberties and privileges, are mo&s;t to be blamed. But this a&s;piring, re&s;tle&s;s, ambitious &s;pirit of the Mi&s;&s;ionaries, never was content to have equal privileges, but always &s;trove for &s;omething &s;uperior to all other religious &s;o|cieties, and to introduce the <HI>Act of Uniformity,</HI> with its penal laws. The&s;e &s;truggles have given ju&s;t ground to fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r them as a common enemy, and to believe, that if any Epi&s;copate be e|&s;tabli&s;hed among us, it will not be &s;o innocent and harmle&s;s as &s;ome pretend, but that it will bring with it the u&s;ual appendage of its Tyrannical Eccle&s;ia&s;ticle Courts, and with them vex|atious law &s;uits, and expen&s;ive appeals, and di&s;tre&s;s and confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>As the old &s;tory of New-England per&s;ecution is again repeat|ed, to the di&s;advantage of Pre&s;byterians, though the Anatomi&s;t allows it was done by the Independents, we will once more give it a due attention. We declare, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn man|ner, that we dete&s;t and abhor per&s;ecution for con&s;cience &s;ake, in Pre&s;byterians, Independents, Epi&s;copalians and Roman Ca|tholicks, as inhuman and antichri&s;tian. We ob&s;erved already, that the people of New-England were led into the&s;e &s;everities by an act of parliament, made in the 35th year of Elizabeth, which condemns all Non-conformi&s;ts, after they are convicted, to <HI>bani&s;hment;</HI> in ca&s;e of return, without licence, to <HI>death,</HI> without benefit of Clergy. This &s;evere law was again renewed anno 1664, in the act again&s;t conventicles, with &s;ome additi|onal &s;everities, in the reign of King Charles, by which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Quakers, with all other Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters, &s;uffered mo&s;t &s;e|verely. The per&s;ecution in New-England was in a time of troubles both in Church and State; the per&s;ecution in Old-England was in a time of peace and tranquility, when the Church of England &s;at at the helm, and carried all before her. The Quakers could not, with any colour or pretence, be pro&s;ecuted by the government for any plots or con&s;piracies, or any di&s;tur&s;bance given to the peace of the State, yet a law was enacted again&s;t <HI>them in particular,</HI> anno 1662, intituled, An Act for preventing mi&s;chiefs, and danger that might ari&s;e from certain people called Quakers, by which they were made liable to &s;evere fines and impri&s;onment, and after the third of|fence to tran&s;portation, <HI>for refu&s;ing to &s;wear.</HI> I &s;hall here tran&s;cribe a pa&s;&s;age from Sewell's Hi&s;tory (Page 335) <Q>Hay|ing now left America, and returned to England, let us go and &s;ee the &s;tate of per&s;ecution at London, where de&s;perate &s;ury now raged, though it was not in that chief city alone the Quakers, &s;o called, were mo&s;t grievou&s;ly per&s;ecuted; for a little before this time there was publi&s;hed in print, a

Many of the&s;e had been grievou&s;ly beaten, or their clothes torn, or taken away from them, and &s;ome were put into &s;uch &s;tinking dungeons, that &s;ome great men &s;aid, they would not put their hunting dogs there. Some pri&s;ons were crowd|ed full, both of men and women, &s;o that there was not &s;uf|ficient room for all to &s;it down at once; and in Che&s;&s;m, <HI>&s;ixty eight</HI> per&s;ons, were in this manner looked up in a &s;mall room; an evident &s;ign, that they were an harmle&s;s people, that would not make any re&s;i&s;tance, nor u&s;e force. By &s;uch ill treatment many grew &s;ick, and <HI>not a few died</HI> in &s;uch jails; for no age, nor &s;ex, was regarded. Even ancient people of &s;ixty, &s;eventy, and more years of age, were not &s;pared; and mo&s;t of the&s;e, being trade&s;men, &s;hop-keepers, and hu&s;bandmen, were thus reduced to poverty. For their goods were al&s;o &s;eized for not going to Church (&s;o called) or for not <HI>paying tithes.</HI> Many times they were fain to lie in pri&s;on, on cold na&s;ty ground, without being &s;uffered to have any &s;traw, and often they have been kept &s;everal days <HI>without any victu|als.</HI> No wonder therefore many died by &s;uch hard impri&s;on|ments as the&s;e,</Q></P>
<P><Q>At London, and in the &s;uburbs, were about this time no le&s;s than <HI>five hundred</HI> of tho&s;e people called Quakers, impri|&s;oned; and &s;ome in &s;uch narrow holes, that every per&s;on had &s;carcely conveniency to lie down, and the felons were &s;uffered to rob them of their clothes and money.</Q>&mdash; This author proceeds to relate many in&s;tances of cruelty and &s;everity to the&s;e people, during the admini&s;tration of the two brothers, Charles and James.

It is well known, that they were the fir&s;t people in Europe that gave univer&s;al toleration to all religious denominations; but we fear no tales; if they be but true, let them be fairly told, to the di&s;honor of all per&s;ecutors. We have neither the incli|nation nor the power to obtain an e&s;tabli&s;hment to harra&s;s and di&s;turb other religious &s;ocieties in America. But that the E|pi&s;copal Mi&s;&s;ionaries, and others of their party, were they <HI>en|couraged, and protected by Bi&s;hops,</HI> have both the power and the inclination, is what we greatly fear. We are prepared to hang out the per&s;ecutions of a Parker, a Whitegift, a Laud, and a Bancroft, to the world, to excite the hatred of mankind a|gain&s;t religious tyranny; and to rai&s;e their horror and abhor|rence of the&s;e &s;evere acts that clothed &s;uch oppre&s;&s;ors with power to do mi&s;chief.

We &s;hall lie on our oars, and if relieved of our fears, &s;hall &s;ay no more of penal laws and per&s;ecutions. But if in&s;tead of arguments, and &s;ound rea&s;ons, we have nothing but &s;hifts and eva&s;ions, we mu&s;t rea|&s;on by analogy; and by what has happened from an Engli&s;h Epi&s;copate, &s;hall argue what we mu&s;t fear from an epi&s;copate, if it be e&s;tabli&s;hed in America.</P>

<Q><P>The men trace the very foot&s;teps of their forefathers.

<BIBL>CAMBDEN'S Annals of Eliz.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SUCH was the character given to the enemies of Epi&s;copacy, in the days of Queen Elizabeth, by the illu&s;trious and im|partial CAMBDEN; and King James, the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Elizabeth, did not find them mended in his day, but declares, in his <HI>Ba&s;i|licon Doren,</HI> (or royal gift to his &s;on, who found them &s;till as little mended) "that they were the pe&s;ts of the commonwealth, whom no de&s;erts can oblige, no oaths or promi&s;es bind; breathing nothing but &s;edition and calumnies; a&s;piring with|out mea&s;ure; railing without rea&s;on; accounting every one un|worthy to enjoy the benefit of breathing, that denies the lea&s;t jot of their grounds; and who would make the &s;cripture to be ruled by their con&s;cience, and not their con&s;cience by the &s;cripture." Nay, though educated among them, this Prince was obliged to complain to his Parliament, "that they were a &s;et of men, ever di&s;contented, and &s;carcely to be &s;uffered in a|ny well-governed commonwealth, becau&s;e nothing can fully &s;atisfy them, but the alteration of the whole frame of govern|ment."</P>
<P>How much of this character belongs to the <HI>Centinel</HI> and o|ther writers, who have been taken notice of in my former num|bers, I leave every reader to determine for him&s;elf. The Cen|tinel in particular, with whom I am more immediately con|cerned, has &s;hewn but little good di&s;po&s;ition to "the frame of Engli&s;h government," by his indecent abu&s;e of an order &s;o clo&s;e|ly interwoven with it. But what he &s;ays on this head, may well be pa&s;&s;ed over, as it will hardly prevail on a &s;en&s;ible na|tion, "to for&s;ake that government, the u&s;e whereof, univer|&s;al experience hath for &s;o many years approved, and betake
<PB N="82" REF="011212_0046_0F862D172FDA1B58">them&s;elves to a regimen, never till ye&s;terday heard of among men."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hooker.</NOTE> His new fangled &s;chemes of government, which he propo&s;es to Churchmen in America, I hope, will meet with as little regard. He a&s;ks&mdash;"why do not the Epi&s;copal Mi|ni&s;ters cho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e one of their number to be their &s;uperior, and <HI>vo|luntarily</HI> agree to be governed by him? Our an&s;wer is ready. We have &s;ome regard to our allegiance; and think this thing does not comport with it. We hope al&s;o, we have &s;ome regard to our principles of Church government, and would not wil|lingly violate them. La&s;tly, we regard decorum and peace; and we think neither would be promoted by unauthorized elec|tions, or a government of this kind; but above all, we are known to hold it as a principle, that the Epi&s;copal character cannot be derived in this manner. Tho&s;e who think otherwi&s;e, and choo&s;e to be governed otherwi&s;e, we do not de&s;ire to mole&s;t; and only claim equal liberty to think for our&s;elves, and follow that mode which we e&s;teem be&s;t, and mo&s;t agreeable to holy &s;cripture and primitive practice.</P>
<P>But the Centinel in his charity, &s;trives to remove our &s;cru|ples on this head, by attempting to &s;hew, (what has often been attempted before him) that <HI>Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters are the &s;ame in &s;cripture.</HI> No doubt, he was in hopes, from this doctrine, to lead the advocates for an American Epi&s;copacy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">to a long train of di&s;pute very foreign to the point in que&s;tion; which is not, whether it is a right belief in the Church&mdash;"that Bi&s;hops are of a divine in&s;titution, an order &s;uperior to Pre&s;by|ters, and e&s;&s;ential to a full eccle&s;ia&s;tical con&s;titution;" but whether this being the belief of her Clergy and Members in America, they are not entitled to &s;uch a con&s;titution, provided it does not interfere with the rights of others? Here I fix my arguments, and from this ground I will not be drawn. It is vain, (and indeed would &s;carce be proper in a news-paper) for &s;uch <HI>puny combitants</HI> as we <HI>Centinels, Anatomi&s;ts,</HI> and <HI>Remon|&s;trants,</HI> to retail over again all that has been written on this &s;ubject by eminent men on both &s;ides. The Church can boa&s;t many champions, but particularly her venerable <HI>Hooker,</HI> who&s;e arguments in the &s;eventh book of his eccle&s;ia&s;ticle polity, &s;tand to this day unrefuted.</P>
<P>This excellent and learned writer (excellent and learned e|ven in the opinion of our antagoni&s;ts) goes to the fountain head of &s;cripture and Church antiquity. He &s;hews what things belonged e&s;&s;entially to the office of Bi&s;hops from the beginning,
<PB N="83" REF="011212_0046_0F862D172FDA1B58">and what were added to it afterwards for rea&s;ons of convenien|cy and human policy. He proves that there ever were in the Church of Chri&s;t an order of men, to whom were given, with permanent continuance, not only power in common with Pre&s;|byters to admini&s;ter the word and &s;acraments, but al&s;o a fur|ther power to ordain eccle&s;ia&s;tical per&s;ons, and a <HI>chiefty</HI> (or pri|macy) in government over the Church. Authentic li&s;ts of &s;uch Bi&s;hops from the earlie&s;t times can be produced, which, whoever will que&s;tion, may as well que&s;tion all facts of hi&s;tory, and whether there was a con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Roman Emperors from Julius Cae&s;ar.</P>
<P>"A thou&s;and five hundred years and upwards (&s;ays he) the Church hath continued under Bi&s;hops; which to have been or|dained of God, I am, for my own part, even as re&s;olutely per|&s;uaded, as that any other kind of government in the world is of God. In this realm of England, before <HI>Normans;</HI> yea, before <HI>Saxons,</HI> there being Chri&s;tians the chief pa&s;tors of their &s;ouls were Bi&s;hops.&mdash;Even at the council of <HI>Ariminum,</HI> about the year 359, Britain had <HI>three</HI> Bi&s;hops pre&s;ent'"</P>
<P>Thus then if we were not able to go back to the time of the apo&s;tles, to prove that a government by <HI>one</HI> had a preference to a Pre&s;byterian government by <HI>many,</HI> yet we can go far enough back, even in the Mother Country, to &s;pare our antagoni&s;ts a <HI>thou&s;and years,</HI> and &s;till have antiquity on our &s;ide, If there|fore, this veneration for antiquity were only a prejudice on our&s;ide, yet as it is a harmle&s;s one, we may be indulged in it.</P>
<P>But it is objected, that granting the ancient power of Bi&s;hops in ordination, yet it is not practi&s;ed now as in the Apo&s;tles' times, in pur&s;uance of &s;ome previous vote or election of the peo|ple, &amp;c. Our venerable Hooker, who could &s;ometimes be merry, laughs at this objection, and &s;hews that all the power given to the people by our antagoni&s;ts them&s;elves in the choice or direc|tion of per&s;ons fit to be &s;et apart for the &s;acred mini&s;try, is a mere illu&s;ion; and that they deal by the people in this ca&s;e "<HI>much as tho&s;e nur&s;es do with infants, who&s;e mouth they be|&s;mear with the</HI> BACKSIDE <HI>of the &s;poon, as though they had fed them, when they them&s;elves devour the food.</HI>"</P>
<P>But what vote of the people, be&s;ides the impo&s;ition of St. Paul's hands had Timothy; whom no one, without denying &s;cripture, can deny to have been a Bi&s;hop, or a pa&s;tor having power &s;uperior to that of Pre&s;byters? "For he was to rule the Church of Ephe&s;us; to <HI>command</HI> and <HI>teach;</HI> to regulate the public wor&s;hip, and hinder women from &s;peaking: to &s;ee that <HI>no doctrines were taught but what were received from our Lord
<PB N="84" REF="011212_0047_0F862D1AAF88DA90">and his Apo&s;tles;</HI> to ordain, or <HI>commit</HI> the doctrine <HI>of the go&s;|pel to faithful men, who &s;hould be able to teach others, and to lay hands &s;uddenly on no man;</HI> to hear and judge of ca&s;es in di&s;pute, but <HI>again&s;t an elder not to receive an accu&s;ation, but be|fore two or three witne&s;&s;es;</HI> and finally, <HI>them that &s;in</HI> to rebuke <HI>before all, that others al&s;o might fear.</HI>"</P>
<P>Here are pointed out the peculiar authorities exerci&s;ed by the primitive Bi&s;hops; and in the like matter, and with the like authorities, not by the people's choice was Titus ordained Bi&s;hop of <HI>Crete</HI> by Paul; and we do believe, from the whole voice of Church hi&s;tory, that there was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;tantly afterwards a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of men, with the power of ordination and government &s;uperior to Pre&s;byters in the Church.</P>
<P>Indeed Calvin him&s;elf, the founder of Pre&s;bytery, doth allow that in the fir&s;t ages of Chri&s;tianity there were Bi&s;hops that had the like power in the a&s;&s;embly of mini&s;ters, as the Roman Con|&s;uls in the &s;enate, to advi&s;e, exhort, regulate debates, and &s;ee that every thing was performed according to rules agreed on. This power is all that we have occa&s;ion to contend for in the matter of government; and the <HI>Centinel</HI> him&s;elf allows, "that few profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity deny Bi&s;hops to be of divine in&s;ti|tution;" nay further, his a&s;&s;ociate the <HI>Remon&s;trant</HI> is willing to allow us twenty Bi&s;hops (even one in every hou&s;e) to ordain, confirm, and in&s;pect the morals of the clergy, provided they have no connection with our civil affairs, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The&s;e conce&s;&s;ions are &s;omething, but alas! I mu&s;t not flatter my&s;elf that they will be allowed to do me much good. The <HI>Centinel</HI> contends that it is impo&s;&s;ible for us to have &s;uch primi|tive Bi&s;hops; becau&s;e contradictory to the known &s;entiments of our Church, and of every other &s;ince the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of Chri&s;tianity. Our idea of Epi&s;copacy he contends likewi&s;e to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>dioce&s;an,</HI> and very different from that which prevailed in the fir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> ages of the church</P>
<P>It any thing in &s;uch an incon&s;i&s;tent writer could be a&s;toni&s;h|ing his &s;tumbling on &s;uch an argument as this would be really &s;o; as it is the very argument I would wi&s;h to u&s;e again&s;t him. For if it be true that the pre&s;ent <HI>dioce&s;an Epi&s;copacy,</HI> with that power over the laity, which he reckons &s;o dangerous, was not th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ort of Epi&s;cocacy that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in the Church from the beginning he allows what I contend for, namely, that an Epi&s;|copa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> different from that in England, having once &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> fixed; and he contradicts his own a&s;&s;ertion, viz. "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> exemption of the laity from the juri&s;diction of the Bi&s;hop, (namely, &s;uch a juri&s;diction as the Continel complains of) is a <HI>novel invention,</HI> without any parallel, &amp;c, I &s;ay, &s;uch
<PB N="85" REF="011212_0047_0F862D1AAF88DA90">a juri&s;diction over the laity as the Centinel complains of; for it would be ab&s;urd to &s;ay, he &s;peaks here of &s;uch a power, as his own pa&s;tors or <HI>Pre&s;byterian Bi&s;hops</HI> (for &s;o they like to be called) think it nece&s;&s;ary to exerci&s;e over the flock committed to them, whether in one or more congregations. If that were his mean|ing, it would be nothing at all to his argument, For &s;urely, he could not in decency &s;trive to alarm all America again&s;t &s;uch a nece&s;&s;ary power as this, unle&s;s he could &s;ay that the &s;ame pow|er which is perfectly innocent in the hands of a Pre&s;byterian Bi&s;hop, would be highly dangerous in a Bi&s;hop of ours; and that what is right in <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Geneva,</HI> cea&s;es to be &s;o in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>America,</HI></P>
<P>Much has been &s;aid about <HI>dioce&s;an Epi&s;copacy,</HI> and &s;ometimes to little purpo&s;e. The truth is, that though &s;uch a Bi&s;hop as <HI>Timothy</HI> was appointed to <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> as his more particular charge, yet he and other Bi&s;hops of his time, were not proper|ly <HI>Dioce&s;an,</HI> but Bi&s;hops at large, who might ordain and go|vern in the Church <HI>in general,</HI> for the more &s;peedy propagati|on of Chri&s;tianity. But it is rea&s;onable to think, (and ancient accounts prove it) that, as this method could not be nece&s;&s;ary long, &s;o it did not long continue; but, for greater conveniency and regularity, different Bi&s;hops became fixed to different di&s;|tricts; and thus a &s;ort of <HI>Dioce&s;an Epi&s;copacy</HI> &s;oon began; yet &s;till, without tho&s;e additions of temporal power, and legal li|mitation of dioce&s;es, which con&s;titute the pre&s;ent Dioce&s;an E|pi&s;copacy; and which could not po&s;&s;ibly take place till civil ru|lers became Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>Now, if the Centinel means any thing by a "juri&s;diction over the laity, dangerous to liberty," he mu&s;t mean the ju|ri&s;diction exerci&s;ed under this la&s;t &s;ort of Dioce&s;an Epi&s;copacy; for his own principles will not permit him to object to the pow|ers exerci&s;ed under the former &s;ort of Epi&s;copacy. Why then, when he has quoted &s;uch eminent writers in our Church, as having a ju&s;t idea of this &s;ort of Epi&s;copacy, will he &s;till in|&s;i&s;t on it that &s;uch an Epi&s;copacy is a <HI>novel invention,</HI> incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;entiments of any Church that ever was on earth? Why cannot he di&s;tingui&s;h between the true <HI>Epi&s;copal charac|ter,</HI> and an adventitious character and powers afterwards an|nexed to it? And the&s;e adventitious powers have been greater or &s;maller in different countries, and in the &s;ame country at different times, he cannot &s;urely think the real epi&s;copal cha|racter e&s;&s;entially connected with them, or altered either by giv|ing or taking them away. I would a&s;k "whether if the Go|vernor of this province &s;hould annex the office of &s;urveyor ge|neral to that of fir&s;t mini&s;ter of the fir&s;t Pre&s;byterian Church in
<PB N="86" REF="011212_0048_0F862D1D57C2BBB0">this city, it would dive&s;t him of his mini&s;terial character? Per|haps &s;ome good people might think the one office rather incon|&s;i&s;tent with the other, but it would not de&s;troy the idea of the mini&s;terial character; nor would it follow, that if this fir&s;t mini|&s;ter &s;hould go to another province, the like adventitious office would be e&s;&s;ential to this mini&s;terial character.</P>
<P>Upon what better principle can our Centinel argue that our Church would con&s;ider and claim all the powers and juri&s;dicti|on annexed to the Epi&s;copal office in England, as e&s;&s;ential to it in America? I &s;hall &s;hew by full authorities, that this neither is, nor can be, the principles of any Churchmen whatever, nor of any man acquainted with the laws of his country, either &s;tatute, common or civil. I thought to have proceeded with the&s;e au|thorities at pre&s;ent, but as they cannot be in&s;erted entire, with the proper remarks, they mu&s;t be deferred till my next number, in which, if I do not mi&s;take my points of law, I hope this di&s;pute will be brought into a narrow compa&s;s.</P>

<P>I CAN &s;carce begin this number, without an acknowledg|ment to &s;undry corre&s;pondents for &s;everal valuable commu|nications; and hope they will not a&s;cribe it to di&s;re&s;pect, but to the propo&s;ed brevity of my plan, that &s;o little notice has been taken of their kind hints. I &s;aw with concern from the fir&s;t, that by who&s;e malice and artifice &s;oever the late illiberal attacks on the Church were begun and cheri&s;hed, they would certainly be productive of much evil, &s;candalize our common <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> and be matter of joy to its enemies, and grief to its real friends. This &s;eems now to be the general &s;entiment of &s;erious men of all per&s;ua&s;ions: and it is but ju&s;tice to &s;ay that I have me, with many, even among the <HI>Pre&s;byterians,</HI> who lament that any pro|vocation was given on their &s;ide; and think that their writers would have &s;hewn a greater moment and weight of <HI>Chri&s;tiani|ty</HI> in one grain of <HI>Charity</HI> and brotherly <HI>Good-will</HI> to the CHURCH, than in all that they have written and publi&s;hed, to traduce and prevent her from enjoying her ju&s;t rights.</P>
<P>From the&s;e con&s;iderations, then, as it was with reluctance I found my&s;elf obliged to enter into this defence, &s;o I have de|termined that on my part, it &s;hall not be protracted into an un|nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="87" REF="011212_0048_0F862D1D57C2BBB0">length. Tho&s;e who take delight in vilifying a Church, &s;o long honoured among true <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> I &s;hall &s;oon leave to the reflections of their own con&s;cience; and in the mean time, I hope, that indulgence with which I have been already favour|ed will be continued to my remaining papers, which will not be many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> number, nor unimportant in their nature.</P>
<P>In my la&s;t, it was ob&s;erved that the <HI>Centinel</HI> (either out of ignorance or wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ful de&s;ign to mi&s;lead his readers) had confound|ed the adventitious powers and juri&s;diction given to Bi&s;hops by human laws, with the powers that belong e&s;&s;entially to the E|pi&s;copal character, and are nece&s;&s;ary for keeping up a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of mini&s;ters, and order in the body eccle&s;ia&s;tical, whether lodg|ed in <HI>One</HI> or in <HI>Many.</HI> With him, the acknowledged di&s;tincti|on between "Powers of <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Order,</HI> and power of <HI>Ju|ri&s;dicston Eccle&s;ia&s;tical,</HI> &s;eems to find no place. He hath in his imagination, &s;tretched the powers of our pre&s;ent Engli&s;h Bi|&s;hops to all the heights in which they were ever exerci&s;ed in the warme&s;t times, and when liberty was lea&s;t under&s;tood; and then when it is &s;aid that Bi&s;hop, with tho&s;e powers are neither de&s;ired, nor can, con&s;i&s;tent with law, be fixed in America, he charges the clergy with acting a treacherous part, and "amu|&s;ing with fal&s;e and incon&s;i&s;tent hopes; becau&s;e a <HI>Church,</HI> who&s;e members are exempted from the government of its officers, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> he &s;ays, what no age can furni&s;h an example of&mdash;a n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Invention." &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now the <HI>Centinel</HI> is here certainly brought into this <HI>Dilem|ma,</HI> either to &s;ay that a Church without all tho&s;e enormous ju|ri&s;dictions, which he had been complaining of, is a novel-Inven|tion; or to &s;ay that the powers he &s;peaks of, are tho&s;e e&s;&s;ential ones enjoyed by all <HI>complete</HI> Churches; and then how is it an argument of incon&s;i&s;tency in our clergy, to de&s;ire a matter of common e&s;&s;ential right? And have no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> all his declamations been employed about phantoms of his own brain?</P>
<P>I have already &s;hewn that &s;uch a Bi&s;hop as the American Clergy pray'd for, is no novel-invention, but known in the pure&s;t ages of the Church; and I might have &s;hewn further, in contradiction to what the Centinel a&s;&s;erts, that Churches, even now upon earth, have Bi&s;hops nearly on the &s;ame foundation. The <HI>Dani&s;h Bi&s;hops</HI> have neither temporal Juri&s;diction, nor ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical courts; nor have the <HI>Moravian Bi&s;hops,</HI> and yet they have the ordination and government of their inferior cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rgy.</P>
<P>But I will now come clo&s;e to the point, and &s;hew that the <HI>Engli&s;h Bi&s;hops</HI> were originally &s;uch al&s;o, and that what ac|ce&s;&s;ion of power and temporal juri&s;diction they obtained, was
<PB N="88" REF="011212_0049_0F862D1E27DEDD08">not by encroachments nor yet claimed as of CHRIST, in virtue of their epi&s;copal office; but given by human laws, generally ex|pre&s;&s;ing the rea&s;on of the Grant, and that neither tho&s;e <HI>Laws</HI> nor <HI>Rea&s;ons</HI> can have place in a country where the con&s;titution is previou&s;ly fixed, and a full provi&s;ion made for all the parts of government, except that alone which governs the true &s;crip|tural order and government of the <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> clergy, agreeable to the belief and con&s;titution of their church.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing that offends our antagoni&s;ts, with re&s;pect to Bi&s;hops is their title of <HI>Lords.</HI> Now if it is con&s;idered how they derive this title, perhaps the <HI>Centinel</HI> may not think him|&s;elf obliged to a&s;&s;ociate the idea of <HI>Lords</HI> to our American <HI>Bi&s;h|ops,</HI> nor to &s;hape his mouth, to that offen&s;ive word, if he &s;hould ever chance to &s;peak to any of them. They are <HI>Lords</HI> as they &s;it in the upper hou&s;e of Parliament, and they &s;it there <HI>per Baroniam,</HI> as Barons accepted by long u&s;ages, but after|wards more expre&s;sly made &s;uch by their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions being turned into Baronies by William the Conqueror, to be held of the King. In re&s;pect to their per&s;ons they are not Barons, nor are they &s;uch in re&s;pect to their order, which they acquire by con&s;ecration, but in re&s;pect only to their temporal incorporation. See Hale's Treati&s;e on the Right of the Crown, and Coke 2d. In&s;t. Sir William Staun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ord al&s;o (153) &s;ays they have not the name of Lords by virtue of their office, nor have they a place in Parli|ament in re&s;pect to their nobility, but in re&s;pect of their po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, viz. the ancient Baronies annexed to their dignities.</P>
<P>Thus the Centinel may perhaps &s;ee a way to &s;eparate one of|fen&s;ive thing, viz. the <HI>Lordly</HI> name, from American Bi&s;hops, but &s;till we hope he will not, for all this, call them bad names.</P>
<P>But let us pa&s;s from names to things, and &s;ee if we can &s;atis|fy him equally about the enormous juri&s;diction over the <HI>Laity</HI> which he has told us, he is greatly apprehen&s;ive mu&s;t accompa|ny the very per&s;ons of Bi&s;hops into America. In fair argu|ment (as ob&s;erved in a former number) the <HI>Onus Probandi</HI> &s;hould lie on the accu&s;er, and he ought to &s;hew by what law now made, or that probably can be made, American Bi&s;hops &s;hould obtain &s;uch juri&s;diction; rather than call on me to prove what contingences are never to take place. Yet even this may be done to the &s;atisfaction of all rea&s;onable men, if they will tru&s;t to the &s;ame faith of laws and &s;ecurity in this matter, which they tru&s;t for their lives and e&s;tates in all other matters.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t go back, then, to enquire how Engli&s;h Bi&s;hops be|came inve&s;ted with juri&s;diction over the <HI>Laity</HI> (for the Centi|nel

<P>It has been already &s;hewn that primitive Bi&s;hops in the fir&s;t three hundred years of the Church, had no courts or juri&s;dicti|on over the laity, &s;eparate from the civil power. So it was al&s;o in England, during the <HI>Saxon Heptarchy.</HI> In each county under different Kings in tho&s;e days, there was an EARL who had the admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice under the KING and was called in la|tin <HI>Comes,</HI> as a&s;&s;i&s;ting the King in the execution of the laws. In each kingdom there was a BISHOP, being &s;even in all En|gland (exclu&s;ive of the <HI>Welch</HI> or <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Bi&s;hops) before the coming of <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> the <HI>Monk.</HI> All matters as well &s;piritual as temporal, were determined in the EARL's or county Court, where the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> was called to the <HI>Earl</HI>'s a&s;&s;i&s;tance for advice in &s;piritual matters; or in the Hundred Court, before &s;ome Lord of the Di&s;trict, with an eccle&s;ia&s;tical per&s;on in the place of the Bi&s;hop.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Duck</HI> 307. 1 <HI>Warn.</HI> 374. 2 <HI>Still.</HI> 14. <HI>God.</HI> 96</NOTE></P>
<P>The great CANUTE the Dane, &s;till pre&s;erved this order, as late as about the year one thou&s;and and &s;eventeen, and gave the rea&s;ons for it; ordaining the <HI>Shire Gemot</HI> or county a&s;|&s;embly "to be held twice a year, and oftener if need requires, wherein the Bi&s;hop and the aldermen of the &s;hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;hall be pre|&s;ent, the one <HI>to teach the Laws of God,</HI> the other <HI>the Laws of the Land.</HI>"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Spelm.

<P>Here is yet no &s;eparate juri&s;diction claimed by the Bi&s;hops o|ver the laity; and when they obtained &s;uch juri&s;diction, it was not, as the Centinel &s;ays, becau&s;e no Church on Earth ever &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted without it, in the oppre&s;&s;ive way he &s;peaks of; for unle&s;e he means this, I &s;till in&s;i&s;t he has &s;aid nothing) but becau&s;e it was thought fit by a King, who gave his rea&s;ons for the change, and having entered England &s;word in hand, would not have &s;ubmitted to have &s;uch power wre&s;ted from him.</P>
<P>It was WILLIAM the <HI>Conqueror</HI> who erected &s;eparate eccle&s;i|a&s;tical courts; and thus runs the charter&mdash;<HI>"Regia auctori|tate praecipio, ut nullus Epi&s;copus in Hundret amplius placita teneat &amp;c."</HI> By virtue of my Royal Authority I do command that no Bi&s;hop do for the future hold pleas, &amp;c. in the Hundred Court, nor bring any cau&s;es which belong to &s;piritual govern|ment, before the judgment of &s;ecular men; but to &s;uch places as the Bi&s;hops &s;hall appoint for that purpo&s;e, &amp;c.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>See the Charter at large in Spelman.</HI></P>

<P>TWO things cannot but be obvious to every one who pe|ru&s;es the late publications on the &s;ubject of <HI>American</HI> Bi&s;hops, viz.&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t, That the advocates for an <HI>American</HI> Epi&s;copacy do &s;ted|fa&s;tly declare they have no farther, nor other view in this mea|&s;ure, than that the Epi&s;copal Churches in the colonies, may have the &s;ame opportunities of keeping up a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Mi|ni&s;ters and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical order, in their body, and agreeable to
<PB N="91" REF="011212_0050_0F862D1EAA36F608">their principles, which all other religious bodies in <HI>America</HI> do enjoy.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, That the opponents of this mea&s;ure &s;trive to alarm all <HI>America</HI> again&s;t it, contending, that although the above may be the &s;pecious plea of the Epi&s;copal Clergy, yet their true de|&s;ign (notwith&s;tanding any a&s;&s;ertions to the contrary) is to in|troduce that yoke of &s;piritual bondage and juri&s;diction over the laity, which neither they nor their fathers could bear.</P>
<P>This is clearly the de&s;ign of the <HI>Centinel</HI>'s productions; who&s;e arguments for &s;uch a bold a&s;&s;ertion, I am now examining; and if they &s;hould be found groundle&s;s, the public will be at no lo&s;s to pronounce him either one of the mo&s;t uncharitable wri|ters on earth, or one of the mo&s;t <HI>ambitious,</HI> in &s;triving to ex|alt his own party, by depriving another (re&s;pectable among all <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI>) of its ju&s;t and e&s;&s;ential rights.</P>
<P>It hath been already &s;hewn, that during the three fir&s;t centu|ries, Bi&s;hops had not, in any part of the world, juri&s;diction over the laity, &s;eparate from the civil powers; nor different from what every Pre&s;byter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>It is not e&s;&s;ential to this argument to inquire, whether, in tho&s;e early days, excommunications, and Church cen&s;ures, were re&s;erved as the peculiar right of the Bi&s;hop alone, or might be put in force by Pre&s;byters, without the Bi&s;hop. It is no mat|ter whether the&s;e Church powers were in</HI> one <HI>or</HI> many, <HI>if they were &s;till in the Church. The powers here &s;poken of are diffe|rent, viz. &s;uch as Engli&s;h Bi&s;hops enjoy, by virtue of particu|lar laws and con&s;titutions, beyond what might be exerci&s;ed over the laity by a Pre&s;byterian Cla&s;&s;is or Synod, or by a Congrega|tional Church, or any other body Eccle&s;ia&s;tical, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">aiming govern|ment within it&s;elf, in matters e&s;&s;ential to its very being. And powers greater than tho&s;e, I &s;ay, can never be exerci&s;ed in</HI> America, <HI>nor any where el&s;e, without law.</HI></NOTE> might have, as e&s;&s;ential to the pa&s;toral office. I have &s;hewn that in <HI>England</HI> al&s;o, the Bi&s;hops had on|ly a &s;ort of concurrent juri&s;diction in the civil courts; and no &s;eparate Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Courts for the ten fir&s;t centuries, and the <HI>William the Conqueror</HI> fir&s;t &s;eparated the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical from the Civil Courts, out of a de&s;ire, as he &s;ays, to do honour to GOD, and godly Bi&s;hops. La&s;tly, it hath been ob&s;erved that the Dani&s;h Bi&s;hops, at this day, have no Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Courts, or grievous juri&s;diction, over the laity.</P>
<P>What then becomes of the <HI>Centinel</HI>'s a&s;&s;ertion, that Bi&s;hops, without Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Courts, and that grievous juri&s;diction over
<PB N="92" REF="011212_0051_0F862D5B40E2CA98">the laity, which he charges the Epi&s;copal Clergy with de&s;iring to introduce into <HI>America,</HI> is a "novel-invention, contrary to the known &s;entiments of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and every o|ther Church on earth; and that therefore the Clergy are not to be believed in this matter, but are amu&s;ing with fal&s;e and in|con&s;i&s;tent hopes?"</P>
<P>But another argument (as &s;tated partly by the <HI>Centinel,</HI> and partly by others) is&mdash;"That <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bi&s;hops now have this obnoxious juri&s;diction over the laity by long enjoyment; that their powers are known by the law of <HI>England,</HI> &s;tatute and common (for it is needle&s;s here to &s;peak of civil or canon <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Neither the civil nor canon law (&s;aith lord</HI> Hale) <HI>have any obligation in this realm&mdash;but &s;o far as they have been admitted either by con&s;ent of Parliament, and &s;o are part of the &s;tatute laws; or by immemorial u&s;age in certain courts and cau&s;es, and &s;o are part of the common law. If it be &s;hewn, then, that neither the &s;tatute nor common law extends to</HI> Ame|rica <HI>in Eccle&s;ia&s;tical cau&s;es, then neither canon or civil law can extend, which derives its validity from the former.</HI>&mdash;</NOTE> law) and that therefore, as we are an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> colony, tho&s;e laws which concerned the office of Bi&s;hops before we had legi&s;latures of our own (by a well known con&s;truction of &s;uch ancient laws) will be con&s;idered as extended, together with the per&s;on and office of a Bi&s;hop, into <HI>America.</HI>"</P>
<P>Having &s;tated this argument, I think, in its full force, I proceed to an&s;wer it, and mu&s;t take up Bi&s;hops where I left them in my la&s;t, viz. from the time of <HI>William the Conqueror.</HI></P>
<P>It was from the charter of this Prince (already quoted) that <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bi&s;hops derived the right of juri&s;diction in &s;eparate Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical Courts; and no one will pretend, that either that charter, or any u&s;age antecedent to it, would be a foundation for &s;uch courts in <HI>America.</HI> After the grant of this charter, the Bi&s;hops, in their &s;eparate courts, proceeded by the &s;ame an|cient laws and cu&s;toms, which had been ob&s;erved for many hun|dred years, in matters of the like kind, during their concurrent juri&s;diction with the <HI>Earl</HI> or <HI>Sheriff</HI> in the County A&s;&s;embly. We find no new &s;tatute to enlarge their powers, but many, &s;uch as the <HI>&s;tatutes of provi&s;ors,</HI> &amp;c. to re&s;trict and explain them; to birdle the u&s;urpations of the Popes, to prev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> appeals to foreign juri&s;dictions, and to vindicate the &s;upremacy of our own Kings in all cau&s;es, Civil and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="011212_0051_0F862D5B40E2CA98">It would be needle&s;s to dwell long on this gloomy period, or the various &s;truggles it produced. It is &s;ufficient to &s;ay that e|ven then, the whole &s;pirit of the laws was this&mdash;That Bi&s;hops could exerci&s;e no powers by virtue of the <HI>canons, re&s;cripts</HI> or <HI>decrees</HI> of Popes, Emperors or foreign councils; unle&s;s &s;o far as tho&s;e powers were allowed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y the common law of the land; and if tho&s;e bounds were exceeded it would not have been al|lowed a &s;ufficient an&s;wer&mdash;to tell the King's Courts, that <HI>Ju&s;tinian,</HI> or Pope <HI>Gregory,</HI> had decreed otherwi&s;e; for all courts are controuled by the common law."</P>
<P>But leaving this unin&s;tructive period, let us come to the Bi|&s;hops under the Reformation. Now their courts are &s;till held &s;eparate from the civil, in virtue of the ancient appointment made by the Conqueror, allowed and confirmed as part of the law of <HI>England</HI> by long u&s;age. But neither the Reformation, nor the received con&s;truction of the common law, nor any po|&s;itive &s;tatute, have extended the juri&s;diction of tho&s;e courts; but all have con&s;pired to define, limit, and explain it. Lord <HI>Coke,</HI> and Lord <HI>Hale,</HI> have accurately explained both the foun|dation of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Courts, and the &s;undry matters cogniza|ble in them by the law of the land.</P>
<P>"As in temporal cau&s;es the King, by the mouth of his judges, doth judge and determine the &s;ame by the temporal laws of <HI>England;</HI> &s;o in cau&s;es Eccle&s;ia&s;tical and Spiritual, the cog|nizance whereof belongeth not to the common laws, the &s;ame are to be determined by Eccle&s;ia&s;tical judges, according to the King's Eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws; which, who&s;oever &s;hall deny, he denieth that the King hath plenary power to deliver ju&s;tice in all cau&s;es to all his &s;ubjects in the&s;e kingdoms."&mdash;Yet &s;till all Eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws are declared to be <HI>&s;ub graviori lege.</HI> The <HI>&s;igna</HI> &s;uperioritatis are always carried by the <HI>common law;</HI> and if Eccle&s;ia&s;tical judges refu&s;e to allow acts of Parliament, or ex|pound them in any other &s;en&s;e than is truly and properly the expo&s;ition of them; or if the cau&s;e be mixt, and &s;ome part of it properly triable at common law, they mu&s;t proceed according to the rules of that law, or the King's Courts in all the&s;e ca&s;es can grant prohibitions, and take the matter before them&s;elves; &s;o that the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Courts in <HI>England</HI> are not now tho&s;e wild and rampant things that they have been de&s;cribed to be.</P>
<P>But whatever they are, I am to &s;hew, that neither the com|mon nor &s;tatute law of <HI>England</HI> can introduce them here in any form,</P>
<P>It is a known rule, that in a colony, having legi&s;lation of its own, the laws of the mother country do not extend to any mat|ter
<PB N="94" REF="011212_0052_0F862D5BEFE72B18">that hath been provided for by the laws of the colony it&s;elf, duly made and confirmed. Now the matters whereof the Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical Courts in <HI>England</HI> have juri&s;diction, are principally the following, viz. <HI>bla&s;phemy, celebration of divine &s;ervice, rights of matrimony, divorces, general ba&s;tardy, probate of te&s;taments, admini&s;trations and accounts upon the &s;ame, ince&s;ts, fornicati|ons and adulteries.</HI></P>
<P>Now the laws of this and every other colony have already made provi&s;ion for the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, in re&s;pect to all tho&s;e matters; and our courts of law would never &s;uffer any Bi&s;hop to exerci&s;e juri&s;diction in them. For example, &s;hould our Bi&s;hop claim the probate of wills in this province, no one need be at a lo&s;s to gue&s;s how little di&s;turbance &s;uch a ground|le&s;s claim would give to the eminent lawyer, who holds that office by as firm a right as any other can be held by the laws of this country. Should a Bi&s;hop call a trial of <HI>ba&s;tardy</HI> out of the courts of law before him&s;elf, our judges would &s;mile at his pre&s;umption, or perhaps puni&s;h him for it, if he per&s;evered to di&s;turb the due admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice. And &s;o of the re&s;t. As to matters of <HI>tithes, dilapidations, reparation of Churches, &s;imony, ordering admi&s;&s;ions, and in&s;titution of clerks,</HI> there can no &s;uch things be &s;o much as known, unle&s;s where there is a full e&s;tabli&s;hment of Clergy, and Dioce&s;an Epi&s;copacy, and &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hment was never known to be brought about in any country by implication, or without po&s;itive and expre&s;s laws for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Coke,</HI> in the li&s;t given of the matters whereof <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> have cognizance in <HI>England,</HI> hath mentioned only two or three more than I have taken notice of, and we are &s;ecured again&s;t any di&s;turbance on account of them, by the happy <HI>toleration act,</HI> and that liberty of con&s;cience &s;ecured in every <HI>American</HI> colony.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, this I aver&mdash;That a dioce&s;e, with temporalties, cannot be created but by law, and that a Bi&s;h|op, in any temporal capacity, without a dioce&s;e and legal e&s;tabli&s;hment, is what the laws of England know nothing of; and on this principle, all that has been &s;aid about erect|ing Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Courts in <HI>America,</HI> falls to the ground at once.</P>
<P>I have never met with a <HI>lawyer</HI> in the colonies that denied the&s;e po&s;itions. I have indeed been told, that two or three ve|ry con&s;iderable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">wyers, to the northward, have &s;aid, that a <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> in <HI>America</HI> would, by the <HI>common law of England,</HI> be con&s;idered as a <HI>Dioce&s;an Bi&s;hop,</HI> bringing the laws of Dioce&s;an Epi&s;copacy with him; and that the Church would thereby
<PB N="95" REF="011212_0052_0F862D5BEFE72B18">gain an e&s;tabli&s;hment. If the&s;e gentlemen can a&s;&s;ert this thing, they not only di&s;grace their acknowledged abilities, but con|tradict them&s;elves, to &s;erve a pre&s;ent turn; for they a&s;&s;erted the direct contrary when it &s;erved another turn, about 15 years ago.</P>
<P>I have a paper before me (viz. the <HI>Independent Reflector,</HI> No. 44, dated September 27, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">53, known to be clubbed by them) in which they write thus, and more like men of the law, than in &s;ome of their late writings, viz.&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>Whether the Church of <HI>England</HI> is equally e&s;tabli&s;hed in the colonies, as in the &s;outhern parts of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> is a que&s;tion that has often been controverted. Tho&s;e who hold the <HI>affirmative,</HI> adduce two arguments,</Q> viz&mdash;</P>
<P><Q><HI>Fir&s;t, that as we are an</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>colony, the con&s;titutional laws of our mother country, antecedent to a legi&s;lature of our own, are binding on us; and therefore, at the planting of this colony, the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>religious e&s;tabli&s;hment took place.</HI></Q> &mdash;They then proceed to an&s;wer this argument as fol|lows.&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed,&mdash;that every new colony, till it has a legi&s;lature of its own, is, in general, &s;ubject to the laws of the country from which it originally &s;prung; but that all of them, without di&s;tinction, are to be &s;uppo&s;ed binding upon &s;uch planters, is neither agreeable to <HI>law</HI> nor <HI>rea&s;on.</HI> The laws which they carry with them, and to which they are &s;ubject, are &s;uch as are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to an&s;wer the original intention of our entering into a &s;tate of &s;ociety.&mdash; But no &s;uch nece&s;&s;ity can be pretended in favour of the in|troduction of any religious e&s;tabli&s;hment what&s;oever,&mdash; becau&s;e civil &s;ociety, as it is antecedent to any Eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;hments, is, in its own nature, unconnected with them, independent of them, and all &s;ociable happine&s;s completely attainable without them.</Q></P>

<HEAD>From the PENNSYLVANIA GAZETTE, Nov. 24. The CENTINEL, No. XX.</HEAD>
<P>INVITED by Dr. Chandler, we have offered to the con&s;i|deration of the public, &s;ome of the objections which we have to the propo&s;ed American Epi&s;copate, with a moderation and candour, which mu&s;t leave a te&s;timony in favour of the Cen|tinel in the brea&s;t of every per&s;on, who has taken time to read our papers. We have waited patiently for more than three months, to &s;ee whether any thing would be &s;aid, either by Dr. Chandler, or his friends, that had any tendency to weaken the force of what we have advanced. The Anatomi&s;t has promi&s;ed &s;omething of this kind, but has hitherto entertained us with an unintere&s;ting &s;tory, which has no relation to the pre&s;ent debate, concerning the expediency of an American Epi&s;copate. He has gone as far back as the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of New-England, and has indu&s;triou&s;ly waded through Bo&s;ton almanacks, unwritten hi&s;to|ries, and fabulous anecdotes, to find an apology for Dr. Chan|dler's Appeal to the public, printed about a year ago. It is not a little &s;urpri&s;ing, that he was contented with &s;o &s;hort a period as an hundred years, and that he did not go back to the time of the Reformation, and give us a complete hi&s;tory of all the objections that have been made to the tyranny, &s;uper&s;tition and per&s;ecutions of the High Flyers of the Church of England, down to the pre&s;ent day, in every quarter of the world, that he might abundantly vindicate Dr. Chandler from the charge of beginning the pre&s;ent di&s;pute by his late publication. For doubtle&s;s all the in&s;tances of abu&s;e, which that bulwark of the Reformation has met with from all the <HI>&s;hamele&s;s &s;cribblers</HI> &s;ince the Reformation, who have had the impudence to &s;ay, that the Church of England ever maintained or practi&s;ed any thing that was wrong, were &s;o many arguments to prove that Dr. Chandler had been obliged, in defence of his injured, per|&s;ecuted Church, to write his Appeal to the Public. But what &s;candalous trifling with the debate mu&s;t this appear to be to e|very unprejudiced per&s;on? Dr. Chandler, with more hone&s;ty
<PB N="98" REF="011212_0054_0F862D5CE3706728">and candour, explicitly acknowledges that his Appeal was wrote from no &s;uch motives. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that Dr. Chan|dler knew the motives which induced him to write, and he has hone&s;tly given them in his introduction, without the mo&s;t di|&s;tant hint to the things, which the Anatomi&s;t has alledged as the cau&s;es of his writing. He has not &s;o much as in&s;inuated, that the per&s;ecutions of the Quakers in New-England, almo&s;t a century ago, or the neglect of the New-York hi&s;torian to give due prai&s;e to an Epi&s;copal Mi&s;&s;ionary, were any of the motives of his writing his Appeal. No &s;uch matter. He de&s;igned it as an apology for his own and his brethren's conduct, in &s;ending home a number of addre&s;&s;es to their &s;uperiors, on the &s;ubject of an American Epi&s;copate. The&s;e are his words: <Q>That appli|cation has been lately made to our &s;uperiors, by the Clergy of &s;eve|ral of the colonies, reque&s;ting one or more Bi&s;hops to be &s;ent o|ver to America, is a matter now generally known, and was never intended to be kept as a &s;ecret. As there is great rea|&s;on to hope, both from a review of the arguments that were offered in the &s;upport of the addre&s;&s;es that were tran&s;mitted on the occa&s;ion, and from the favourable di&s;po&s;ition of ma|ny in authority, that this reque&s;t in due time will be granted; it has been thought proper, in a public manner, to inform all, who may imagine them&s;elves to be any way concerned in the event of our application, candidly and explicitly, for what rea&s;ons, and with what views an American Epi&s;copate is &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ired by the Clergy, and the other friends and members of the Church.</Q>&mdash;Then, after mentioning the alarm that this conduct of the Clergy had given, he invites all, who had any objections again&s;t the &s;cheme. <Q>to propo&s;e them in &s;uch a manner, that they may be fairly and candidly de|bated before the tribunal of the public; and if none &s;hall be offered, it will be taken for granted that all parties ac|quie&s;ce, and are &s;atisfied<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>App. pages</HI> 1 <HI>and</HI> 2.</NOTE></Q> Dr Chandler is not a&s;hamed to acknowledge, and has too much hone&s;ty to deny, that the alarm was given by this conduct of the Epi&s;copal Mi&s;&s;ionaries in &s;eve|ral of the colonies, and wrote his Appeal as an apology for them, with the hopes of removing any unea&s;ine&s;s that might remain, and of preventing any oppo&s;ition to the prepo&s;ed plan. What mu&s;t we then think of the ingenuity and veracity of the Anatomi&s;t, who does not he&s;itate to &s;ay, "that Dr. Chandler, far from being the aggre&s;&s;or, is only a defendant, in a di&s;|pute which was commenced on the part of the antagoni&s;ts of the Church in New-England" (that is, by the Epi&s;copal Mini|&s;ters,
<PB N="99" REF="011212_0054_0F862D5CE3706728">the known antagoni&s;ts of the <HI>Church in New-England</HI>) as early as the year 1734 <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Anat. No</HI> 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This is a &s;ufficient an&s;wer to all the Anatomi&s;t has &s;aid in the fir&s;t eight of his numbers, and if he thinks it of importance enough to fill up eight more of his papers with other arguments to vindicate Dr. Chandler from a charge which the Doctor him&s;elf has hone&s;tly confe&s;&s;ed, and can prevail on the public to li&s;ten to &s;uch egregious triffling with the debate, he is welcome to try his hand at the bu&s;ine&s;s a &s;econd time.</P>
<P>The Anatomi&s;t, after he has worn out the patience of his readers in his northern expedition, where, <HI>Quixote</HI> like, he has been fighting with windmills, hobgoblins, gorgons, chimeras and hydras, has at length returned to the place of beginning, without having advanced a &s;tep in the debate about importing into the colonies that precious commodity, an American Epi&s;|copate. But to make an atonement for his long and tire&s;ome introduction, he now propo&s;es, without any farther ceremony or circumlocution, to fall upon the Centinel without remor&s;e, and cut him up, whether living or dead, with all that inhuma|nity, which his art requires. But &s;till, as if he was unwilling to undertake the di&s;agreeable office, he begins to make excu&s;es, that he cannot under&s;tand the <HI>Centinel</HI>'s arguments, or reduce them into any kind of form or connection; and, indeed, he &s;u&s;pects there is &s;carce any thing in his papers that wears the &s;emblance of an argument. Some men are &s;o blind as not to &s;ee the force of an argument, from the prejudice of education, and others from a natural defect in their intellects; but, without determining which of the&s;e may be the ca&s;e with the Anato|mi&s;t, we &s;hall endeavour to give him all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance that we can, to encourage him to proceed in the work he has underta|ken, and, from time to time, will hold out to his view the ar|guments we have u&s;ed again&s;t the e&s;tabli&s;hment of Bi&s;hops in America, until he has tried his matchle&s;s prowe&s;s upon them.</P>
<P>But as the Anatomi&s;t has &s;een proper to begin with an ob&s;er|vation picked out of the Centinel's 18th number, we &s;hall attend him there at pre&s;ent, and examine what he has &s;aid to &s;hew its weakne&s;s. The Centinel, in that paper, charges Dr. Chandler with a di&s;ingenuous attempt to gild the di&s;agreeable pill, by a|mu&s;ing the laity of his own communion with the incon&s;i&s;tent hopes of an exemption from the authority and juri&s;diction of the new created Bi&s;hop. Dr. Chandler has &s;aid (page 95) that "the American Bi&s;hops are to have no authority, nor indeed
<PB N="100" REF="011212_0055_0F862D5DDA2CD228">to exerci&s;e any di&s;cipline over their own people, the Clergy-ex|cepted." The Centinel endeavoured kindly to undeceive the people. and to let them know that it was a vain incon&s;i&s;tent hope, with which they were flattered, <Q>that a Bi&s;hop &s;hould have no authority to exerci&s;e di&s;cipline over his own people, was incon&s;i&s;tent with the known &s;entiments of the Church of England, and of every other Chri&s;tian Church in the world, and a mere <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ovel invention, without any parallel in hi&s;tory either &s;acred or profane, &s;ince the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of a church on earth.</Q> Both the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions the Anatomi&s;t has ventured to deny. My veracit, to his upon the proof. He has conde&s;cended to mention only the Church of England, as de|nying that the officers of it have any &s;uch power e&s;&s;ential to their office. He &s;ays, <Q>that it is no doctrine of our Church, as the Centinel would a&s;&s;ert, that they hold it in&s;eparable from their office, and immediately of CHRIST. This proud boa&s;t is indeed made by Independents and Pre&s;byterians, though they have never yet produced their charter<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Anat. No.</HI> 9.</NOTE></Q>. Pray, Sir, does not your Church yearly, in the commination before Lent, &s;olemnly confe&s;s before GOD your want of that godly di&s;cipline, which prevailed in the pure&s;t ages of the Church, antecedent to any human e&s;tabli&s;hment? And as to the charter of the Mi|ni&s;ters in the Chri&s;tian Churches, you may find it recorded, Acts xx, 28, and in the Epi&s;tles to Timothy and Titus. To &s;ay that a Chri&s;tian Mini&s;ter has no power to govern the laity of the Church over which he pre&s;ides, is a bold and groundle&s;s a&s;&s;erti|on; and I challenge the Anatomi&s;t to produce a &s;ingle writer on Church Government, either in the Epi&s;copal or Pre&s;byterian Churches, be&s;ides him&s;elf, who has denied the authority of Chri|&s;tian Bi&s;hops to govern the people of their charge, independent of all &s;tate appointments and civil e&s;tabli&s;hments what&s;oever, but derived to them immediately from JESUS CHRIST, the only head of the Church. What a &s;candalous eva&s;ion then is it for him to quote his Civilian Burn, to prove that the Engli&s;h Bi|&s;hops derived juri&s;diction over the laity in <HI>certain ca&s;es,</HI> by the laws of the kingdom? Could the Anatomi&s;t per&s;uade him&s;elf, that the con&s;equence would follow from &s;uch premi&s;es, that they had no power to exerci&s;e di&s;cipline over the laity in other matters derived to them from CHRIST? Which was the thing he under|took to prove, in order to invalidate my a&s;&s;ertion. For the Cen|tinel, in the place in que&s;tion, talks of no juri&s;diction or autho|rity over the laity, but what exi&s;ted in the three fir&s;t centuries,
<PB N="101" REF="011212_0055_0F862D5DDA2CD228">and what every Bi&s;hop or Pre&s;byter had, as e&s;&s;ential to his office as a pa&s;tor.</P>
<P>This is the authority and di&s;cipline which is derived from Chri&s;t, that is ruined by your oppre&s;&s;ive Te&s;t Act in England; this is the di&s;cipline the Church of England is con&s;tantly la|menting the want of, without attempting to re&s;tore it; this is the di&s;cipline which Dr. Chandler &s;ays is not to be re&s;tored under the new American Epi&s;copate; and this is the di&s;cipline from which the laity of your communion are promi&s;ed an exemption, to make the di&s;agreeable do&s;e they are about to &s;wallow more palatable. And this doubtle&s;s is the juri&s;diction, for the exerci&s;e of which the Anatomi&s;t &s;ays, "the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church of Scot|land has never yet produced their charter;" for he certainly could not mean a different juri&s;diction with which they are in|ve&s;ted, as an e&s;tabli&s;hment by the laws of the kingdom. What then has the Anatomi&s;t &s;aid to relieve Dr. Chandler, and his brethren, from the charge we have brought again&s;t him, for im|po&s;ing upon the people with the vain hope of an exemption from the authority and juri&s;diction of his new Bi&s;hop? An exempti|on never before heard of in any Chri&s;tian Church, and incon|&s;i&s;tent with the known &s;entiments of the Church of England, as well as of every other Church in the world. If the Anato|mi&s;t will take the trouble of reviewing his argument on this head, he will find that the Centinel has been perfectly con&s;i|&s;tent with him&s;elf; and that the Anatomi&s;t has, either through inattention or de&s;ign, gro&s;ly mi&s;repre&s;ented the Centinel, when he &s;ays, that Writer contends, "that it is impo&s;&s;ible for the E|pi&s;copal Mi&s;&s;ionaries in the Colonies, to have &s;uch primitive Bi&s;hops (as were in the fir&s;t ages of the Church) becau&s;e con|tradictory to the known &s;entiments of the Church of England, and every other &s;ince the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of Chri&s;tianity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Anat. No.</HI> 10.</NOTE>." The Centinel never &s;aid &s;uch a thing, never contended for &s;uch a thing, either explicitly or implicitly. It is therefore hoped that the Anatomi&s;t w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> attempt to do ju&s;tice to his own charac|ter, either by a candid acknowledgment, that he has mi&s;repre|&s;ented the Centinel, or by proving what he has a&s;&s;erted. Nay, &s;o far is the Centinel from contending for &s;uch a thing, that he contends that all your Mi&s;&s;ionaries are &s;uch primitive Bi&s;hops as were in the fir&s;t three centuries, that he has not, in the pa&s;&s;age referred to, &s;aid a &s;ingle word about &s;uch a juri&s;diction of Bi&s;h|ops, as he in other papers ju&s;tly complains of, as dangerous to the civil and religious rights of mankind, but only that Dr. Chandler was much to be blamed for endeavouring to impo&s;e
<PB N="102" REF="011212_0056_0F862D5E61F9A5A8">on the Laity of his own Church, by giving them the incon|&s;i&s;tent hopes of an exemption from &s;uch a juri&s;diction of Bi&s;hops over them, as was e&s;&s;ential to their office, and allowed to be &s;o, by every Chri&s;tian Church in the world. This was the juri&s;|diction and di&s;cipline that Dr. Chandler, whom the Centinel was an&s;wering, &s;poke of, in the pa&s;&s;ages quoted from his Appeal. A little attention and candour, Mr. Anatomi&s;t, would have &s;aved you the labour of compo&s;ing your 9th, 10th and 11th numbers, or at lea&s;t a very con&s;iderable part of them. How|ever there are two excellent conce&s;&s;ions in the&s;e papers, which we hope you will not forget, viz. "That in the three fir&s;t cen|turies, the Bi&s;hops had no juri&s;diction over the Laity, different from what every Pre&s;byter had, as e&s;&s;ential to his office as a pa&s;tor <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Anat. No.</HI> 9.</NOTE>.,' And that neither Timothy nor Titus were Dioce&s;an Bi&s;hops, but Bi&s;hops at large; nay, that there were no Dioce|&s;an Bi&s;hops originally, till, in proce&s;s of time, "for greater conveniency and regularity, different Bi&s;hops became fixed to different di&s;tricts <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid. No.</HI> 10.</NOTE>;" although you had ju&s;t before, in the &s;ame paper; &s;ettled his Grace Lord Bi&s;hop Timothy in the Dioce&s;e of Ephe&s;us, and Lord Bi&s;hop Titus in that of Crete. But le&s;t you &s;hould be called upon to vindicate the&s;e good Bi&s;hops, from the &s;candalous crime of non re&s;idency (of which you know they were as notoriou&s;ly guilty as any Bi&s;hops in England) you have &s;tripped them of the Dioce&s;es, which you had, to &s;erve a turn, ju&s;t before given them, and turned them out at large, to govern in the Church in general.</P>
<P>The able&s;t advocates for Epi&s;copacy, &s;uch as Bret, Hoadley, &amp;c. freely acknowledge that Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;byters, in the New-Te&s;tament, are &s;ynonimous terms. And it is well known, that they were inve&s;ted with power by a &s;cripture charter, to take heed to them&s;elves, and to their flock, over which the Ho|ly Gho&s;t made them Bi&s;hops. And all that are acquainted with the Fathers, or a &s;tate of the primitive Church, know well that there were no pluralities in tho&s;e days, nor had the Bi&s;hops in tho&s;e days, an over&s;ight of more than the people that received the &s;acrament together in one place, and attended public wor|&s;hip in one hou&s;e, and Pre&s;byterian Pa&s;tors or Bi&s;hops, as the Anatomi&s;t confe&s;&s;es them to be, were the New-Te&s;tament pri|mitive Bi&s;hops. The primitive Church exerci&s;ed a &s;trict di&s;ci|pline, and took a &s;pecial care of the morals of their people, by the powers given their pa&s;tors by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, but fines and impri&s;onments, and penal laws, were left to Dioce&s;an Epi&s;co|pacy,
<PB N="103" REF="011212_0056_0F862D5E61F9A5A8">and to Church zealots, &s;uch as Parker, Whitgift, Laud, and others of their &s;tamp.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><P>Thou art &s;nared with the words of the mouth.</P>
<BIBL><HI>SOLOMON.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN my la&s;t number it hath been &s;hewn (by arguments which I think all the <HI>Whigs</HI> and <HI>Kickers</HI> and <HI>Centinels</HI> and <HI>Remon|&s;trants</HI> on this continent, will not be able to invalidate) that a church e&s;tabli&s;hment, and eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts, having juri&s;dic|tion over the laity, cannot by the common law of England, be introduced into America in the per&s;on of a bi&s;hop; and it hath been my good fortune to be able to confirm this doctrine by the authority of &s;ome gentlemen, who have long been deem|ed <HI>Oracles of the law,</HI> and champions for the <HI>good old cau&s;e,</HI> a|mong the <HI>Pre&s;byterian Party.</HI> To what purpo&s;e then is all the noi&s;e that has been made on this Head and the pains that have been taken by the&s;e gentlemen and their adherents to per&s;uade the people of the&s;e colonies, that the introduction of Bi&s;hops in|to America, would nece&s;&s;arily introduce arbitrary eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts, and lead to a general e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Epi&s;copal church here. Could any thing more be meant by this than to alarm and impo&s;e on weak minds? Can it be &s;uppo&s;ed po&s;&s;ible that &s;uch writers &s;hould believe them&s;elves, when they a&s;&s;ert tenets &s;o directly contrary, not only to the known con&s;truction of all law, but to their own avowed principles on every other occa&s;ion? Or can they mean any thing more than to oppre&s;s and bear down the <HI>Church,</HI> by preventing her from obtaining her ju&s;t &amp; e&s;&s;ential rights that they may the more ea&s;ily erect a dominion of their own?</P>
<P>But it may be an&s;wered, that tho' the&s;e writers have &s;ugge&s;ted their fears, that the afore&s;aid grievances would accompany, or &s;oon follow, the &s;ettlement of a Bi&s;hop in America, yet it is no where &s;aid by them that the Bi&s;hop would derive his powers from the common law.</P>
<P>True it is that tho&s;e writers, and particularly the <HI>Centinel,</HI> have contented them&s;elves with &s;preading fears and alarms in general, as the ea&s;ie&s;t way of carrying their ends; and do no
<PB N="104" REF="011212_0057_0F862D641E6F0FB8">where give us the particular grounds of their fears. Had they done this they would have &s;hewn them&s;elves men of candour; the an&s;wer would have been ea&s;y, and I &s;hould not have been under the nece&s;&s;ity of con&s;idering every po&s;&s;ible ground of ap|prehen&s;ion, in order to quiet them. But this ta&s;k hard as it is, I have been obliged to undertake for the &s;ake of truth and an injured Church; and I propo&s;e to complete it, with the ut|mo&s;t &s;incerity and fairne&s;s.</P>
<P>It hath been already &s;aid, that there are only the following ways, in which a bi&s;hop can be inve&s;ted with the <HI>apprehended</HI> powers. He mu&s;t derive them from the <HI>Common Law,</HI> or from <HI>Statute Law;</HI> or judges will be intimidated to wre&s;t the pre|&s;ent laws in a Bi&s;hop's favour; or &s;ome new law will be made by the Parliament, or by the colonies. The&s;e are all the ways that have been ever &s;ugge&s;ted, or which I think can po&s;&s;ible be conceived. If the Centinel can name any other, I &s;hould think my&s;elf indebted to him for the intelligence.</P>
<P>The Common Law, I believe, from what has been &s;aid, is now out of the que&s;tion. Let us come to Statute Law, and here the &s;ame gentlemen that a&s;&s;i&s;ted me before, &s;hall &s;peak for me again. For &s;ometimes, <HI>Argumentum ad Hominem,</HI> is the be&s;t that can be u&s;ed, and no men can be better condemn|ed, than out of their own mouths.</P>
<P>The <HI>Independent</HI> Reflector afore&s;aid &s;ays, that the only ar|guments that can be offered with the lea&s;t plau&s;ibility in favour of an exten&s;ion of the Engli&s;h church e&s;tabli&s;hment to Ameri|ca, (without which Dioce&s;an Epi&s;copacy, Eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts, &amp;c. are chimeras) mu&s;t be founded on the <HI>Common Law,</HI> or the act which e&s;tabli&s;heth the Epi&s;copal Church in <HI>South Bri|tain,</HI> previous to the <HI>Union Act.</HI> Having di&s;patched what re|lates to the common, as in my la&s;t, this writer proceeds as fol|loweth; taking along with his own arguments, tho&s;e of Mr. <HI>Hobart,</HI> in his <HI>&s;econd Addre&s;s to the Epi&s;copal Separation in New-England,</HI> who is complimented with the title, (and per|haps truly) of an ingenious gentleman.</P>
<P><Q>The act we are now di&s;puting about, was made in the 5th year of QUEEN ANNE; and is entitled, <HI>an Act for</HI> SECU|RING <HI>the Church of</HI> England, <HI>as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed.</HI> The occa&s;ion of the &s;tatute was this. The parliament in <HI>Scot|land,</HI> when treating of an <HI>Union</HI> with <HI>England,</HI> were appre|hen&s;ive of its endangering their eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;hment. <HI>Scotland</HI> was to have but a &s;mall &s;hare in the Legi&s;lature of Great-Britain, &amp;c.&mdash;The <HI>Scots,</HI> therefore, to prevent having their eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;hment repealed in a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> parliament, where they might be &s;o ea&s;ily outvoted by <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI>
<PB N="105" REF="011212_0057_0F862D641E6F0FB8">members, pa&s;&s;ed an act previous to the <HI>Union,</HI> e&s;tabli&s;h|ing the <HI>Pre&s;byterian Church,</HI> within the kingdom of Scot|land, in perpetuity, and made this act an e&s;&s;ential and fun|damental part of the Union, which might not be repealed, or altered by any &s;ub&s;equent Briti&s;h parliament. And this put the Engli&s;h parliament upon pa&s;&s;ing this act for &s;ecuring the church of England. Neither of them de&s;igned to en|large the bounds of their eccle&s;ia&s;tical con&s;titution, or extend their e&s;tabli&s;hment further than it reached before, but only to <HI>&s;ecure</HI> and <HI>perpetuate</HI> it in its pre&s;ent extent. This is evi|dent, not only from the occa&s;ion of the act, but from the charitable temper the Engli&s;h parliament was under the in|fluence of, when they pa&s;&s;ed it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The title of the act is exactly agreeable to what we have &s;aid of the de&s;ign of it, and of the temper of the parliament that pa&s;&s;ed it. 'Tis entitled, an act not for enlarging, but for <HI>&s;ecuring</HI> the church of England, and that not in the A|merican plantations, but as it is <HI>now</HI> by law e&s;tabli&s;hed; which plainly means no more than to perpetuate it within its anci|ent boundaries.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The <HI>Provi&s;ion</HI> made in the act it&s;elf, is well adapted to this de&s;ign; for it enacts, that the act of the 13th. of ELIZA|BETH, and the act of Uniformity, pa&s;&s;ed in the 13th year of CHARLES the II. and all and &s;ingular other acts of parlia|ment then in force for the e&s;tabli&s;hment and pre&s;ervation of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> &s;hould remain in full force for ever; and that every &s;ucceeding &s;overeign &s;hould at his coronation, take and &s;ub&s;cribe an oath to maintain and pre&s;erve inviola|bly, the <HI>&s;aid Settlement</HI> of the church of <HI>England, as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed,</HI> within the Kingdoms of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> thd Dominion of <HI>Wales,</HI> and the town of <HI>Berwick</HI> upon <HI>Tweed,</HI> and the territories thereunto belonging. This act does not u&s;e &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions as would have been proper and even nece&s;&s;ary, had the de&s;ign been to have made a new e&s;ta|bli&s;hment, but only &s;uch as are proper to ratify and confirm an old one. The &s;ettlement which the King is &s;worn to pre&s;erve, is repre&s;ented as exi&s;ting previous to the pa&s;&s;ing this act, and not as made by it. The words of the oath are, <HI>to maintain and pre&s;erve inviolably the &s;aid &s;ettlement.</HI> If it be a&s;ked, <HI>what Settlement?</HI> The an&s;wer mu&s;t be, a &s;ettlement hereto|fore made and confirmed by certain &s;tatutes, which for the greater certainty and &s;ecurity are enumerated in this act, and and declared to be unalterable. This is the &s;ettlement the King is &s;worn to pre&s;erve, and this &s;ettlement has no relati|on
<PB N="106" REF="011212_0058_0F862D64E6E35A50">on to us in <HI>America;</HI> for the act which originally made it, did not reach hither, and this act which perpetuates them, does not extend them to us.</Q></P>
<P>The writer then proceeds to &s;hew, "that it is a mi&s;take to imagine the word <HI>Territories</HI> (in the title of the act) was in|tended to comprehend the colonies, but only the i&s;lands of <HI>Jer|&s;ey</HI> and <HI>Guern&s;ey,</HI> which were properly &s;uch" territories de|pending on the immediate government of England, as fully &s;a|tisfied the words in the &s;aid title. "It is, &s;ays he, the invaria|ble practice of the Legi&s;lature, in every act of parliament, de|&s;igned to affect us, to u&s;e the words <HI>Colonies</HI> or <HI>Plantations;</HI> nor is it to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that in &s;o important a matter (as the exten&s;ion of the Engli&s;h Church e&s;tabli&s;hment, its eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws, &amp;c.) words of &s;o direct and broad an intent would have been omitted."</P>
<P>This rea&s;oning is &s;ufficiently conclu&s;ive; and certain it is that no Briti&s;h act, &s;ince we had Legi&s;latures of our own, hath been con&s;idered to bind the colonies, unle&s;s they were expre&s;sly na|med. Now mo&s;t of our colony ligi&s;latures exi&s;ted long before this act of Queen <HI>Anne.</HI> More than 60 years have &s;ince elap&s;ed, and in no part of America hath ever this act been pleaded as the lea&s;t foundation for any church e&s;tabli&s;hment, but where ever &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hment hath taken place, colony laws hath been made for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>If then, neither from this act, nor any other Briti&s;h &s;tatute, the lea&s;t parochial e&s;tabli&s;hment, <HI>Tythe,</HI> or temporal advantage, can be claimed in favour of a Pre&s;byter of the church of Eng|land, more than any other Pre&s;byter in the colonies; how could it be po&s;&s;ible from <HI>Statute Law</HI> to plead an e&s;tabli&s;hment of Dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy and eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts? No one believes this po&s;&s;ible; nay not even tho&s;e who at pre&s;ent think proper to alarm their followers with the notion of it.</P>
<P>Since then, neither <HI>common</HI> nor <HI>&s;tatute</HI> laws that are, nor a|ny colony law can ve&s;t <HI>American</HI> Bi&s;hops with the powers in que&s;tion; all other ground of clamour mu&s;t re&s;t in the imagi|nation of the&s;e writers them&s;elves; and till they will favour us with the cau&s;e and nature of their apprehen&s;ions, it will not be ea&s;y to remove them. Here then I might drop my pen, were it not on account of &s;ome well meaning people who are impo&s;ed upon by their crafty leaders, and on who&s;e account a few papers more may not be unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>POSTSCRIPT. Since the above went to the pre&s;s, I have &s;een a paper called the <HI>Centinel,</HI> No. 20. which is the &s;tran|ge&s;t jumble of mi&s;repre&s;entation and unworthy argument, that ever came from a writer, affecting candour. I &s;hall &s;ubjoin a
<PB N="107" REF="011212_0058_0F862D64E6E35A50">few remarks on &s;ome parts of it, for it is in general below notice.</P>
<P>He &s;ays, I have gone back to the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of New Eng|land, to find an apology for Dr. Chandler's appeal.&mdash; Now I &s;aid at fir&s;t, that if Dr. Chandler &s;tood in need of any apology, he was able to make it for him&s;elf, that my de&s;ign was of another nature, and that I went &s;o far back, to &s;hew what &s;ort of &s;pirit the antagoni&s;ts of the church in America had po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed from the beginning; and that the few writers on behalf of the church in the colonies, Dr. C. as well as others, had ever been acting on the <HI>defen&s;ive,</HI> far from being <HI>aggre&s;&s;ors</HI> in this, or any former di&s;pute. And I need not repent the &s;hort review I took, as it has opened the eyes of many.</P>
<P>He &s;ays "the neglect of a New-York hi&s;torian to give due prai&s;e to one mi&s;&s;ionary" is a&s;&s;igned by me as another cau&s;e of Dr. Chandler's appeal. I have indeed, as part of my plan, to &s;hew the temper of our antagoni&s;ts, convicted a New-York hi|&s;torian of palpable fal&s;hoods, not only concerning one mi&s;&s;iona|ry, but the &s;ociety in England, and many mi&s;&s;ionaries; but &s;aid not a word of this being the cau&s;e of Dr. Chandler's ap|peal.</P>
<P>He &s;ays further, "that I undertook to prove, that Bi&s;hops had no power to exerci&s;e di&s;cipline over the laity in matters de|rived to them from Chri&s;t." Now I have no where undertaken any &s;uch thing, but appeal to every reader whether I have not carefully di&s;tingui&s;hed between the powers both of order and government that are <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to the epi&s;copal office, as derived immediately from Chri&s;t; and tho&s;e <HI>adventitious</HI> powers, deriv|ed from human laws. The former powers are what we have all along been contending for, as what our church is entitled to in common with all others, whether lodged in <HI>one,</HI> or in <HI>many.</HI></P>
<P>He &s;ays I confe&s;s Pre&s;byterian pa&s;tors to be Bi&s;hops.&mdash; "Now I have &s;aid <HI>they like to be &s;o called,</HI> but have confe&s;&s;ed nothing in their favour. On the contrary I have declared my belief, "that there has con&s;tantly been in the church of Chri&s;t, a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of men with powers of ordination and government &s;uperior to Pre&s;byters."</P>
<P>He charges me with giving Timothy a Dioce&s;e, and then &s;tripping him of it. My words are, that Timothy's charge, which was <HI>Ephe&s;us more particularly,</HI> "was not properly <HI>Dio|ce&s;an,</HI>" as he was not re&s;tricted to exerci&s;e office there only, "but might ordain and govern in the church in general for the more &s;peedy propagation of Chri&s;tianity." The&s;e words were well weighed and can be well defended. As to the &s;neer
<PB N="108" REF="011212_0059_0F862D6528B24A08">Timothy's <HI>Non-Re&s;idence,</HI> it is too low even to provoke a &s;mile; for when he went to di&s;tant places for the purpo&s;es of govern|ment in the church, or for the ordination of Bi&s;hops and Pre&s;|byters, it no more di&s;&s;olved his particular connection with the Ephe&s;ians, or made him chargeable with <HI>Non-Re&s;idence,</HI> than our <HI>would-be</HI> Pre&s;byterian Bi&s;hops are chargeable with <HI>Non-Re|&s;idence,</HI> and their connection with their congregations di&s;&s;olved, when they <HI>gad about</HI> to Synods and Pre&s;byteries in di&s;tant places and di&s;tant provinces, during long months, for the purpo&s;es of ordination and government, in their way.</P>
<P>I have but a remark or two more. The Centinel &s;ays, "he never contended that it is impo&s;&s;ible for the epi&s;copal mini&s;ters to have primitive Bi&s;hops," that (is as he explains it a few lines further) Bi&s;hops without the juri&s;diction he el&s;ewhere complains of; for that in the pa&s;&s;age referred to, he &s;ays not a &s;ingle word about &s;uch juri&s;diction."&mdash;</P>
<P>Surely this writer forgets his own words.&mdash;"Many members (&s;ays he) of the epi&s;copal communion dete&s;t <HI>Spiritu|al Domination,</HI> and are as tenacious as others of their civil and religious liberty."&mdash;And then adds, "le&s;t the&s;e &s;hould op|po&s;e the &s;cheme of introducing the&s;e new ma&s;ters, they are a|mu&s;ed with the <HI>fal&s;e</HI> and <HI>incon&s;i&s;tent</HI> hopes of being entirely exempted from their juri&s;diction. Now I would a&s;k what juri&s;|diction can be here meant&mdash;but the &s;piritual domination ju&s;t mentioned and connected with the whole &s;entence; that <HI>Domination</HI> which laymen tenacious of civil and religious liber|ty would oppo&s;e? If this is not the juri&s;diction the Centinel was complaining of, he has been complaining of nothing.</P>
<P>And now, tedious as the Centinel thinks I have been, (tho' yet little more than half as tedious as him&s;elf) I have brought the matter to this &s;hort i&s;&s;ue; which if he evades, he will give me leave to u&s;e &s;ome of his own polite phra&s;es, and cry out in my turn, "egregious triffling, &s;candalous, eva&s;ion, &amp;c!"</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Either the juri&s;diction he has been clamouring again&s;t is what he confe&s;&s;es, "e&s;&s;ential to the office of Bi&s;hops, and allow|ed &s;o to be by every Chri&s;tian church." And then let him give me a rea&s;on why the church of England in America, may not have that juri&s;diction agreeable to her own way? Or&mdash;</P>
<P N="2">2dly. The juri&s;diction he means is that <HI>adventitious</HI> autho|rity given to Dioce&s;an Bi&s;hops by human laws. And then let him &s;hew from what law that now is, &s;uch juri&s;diction can be de|rived to a Bi&s;hop in America.</P>

<P>THE prie&s;ts in Spain, in order to rivet the prejudices of their party again&s;t the <HI>reformed religion,</HI> once told the people that <HI>prote&s;tants</HI> were not like <HI>catholics,</HI> but had heads like <HI>dogs</HI> and other furious animals.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t &s;uch a piece of art our Centinel &s;eems to have u&s;ed, in order to terrify the good people of America in regard to Bi&s;h|ops. For he u&s;hers in his very fir&s;t paper into the world with the following prepo&s;terous picture from Horace, viz.
<Q><L><HI>Humano capiti, cirvicem pictor equinam</HI></L>
<L><HI>Jungere &s;i velet, &amp;c.</HI>&mdash;</L></Q> And endeavours, through all his &s;ucceeding numbers, to repre|&s;ent <HI>prelates</HI> as <HI>mon&s;ters,</HI> more frightful and dangerous than tho&s;e of the Spani&s;h prie&s;ts. Every thing that could be judged exceptionable in the character of Bi&s;hops that lived a century ago, is collected as it were into one character for our American Bi&s;hop; and then it is mode&s;tly hinted, that if &s;uch a creature &s;hould be let loo&s;e in America, he would devour all before him; or as the Centinel him&s;elf has it, would "de&s;troy our charters, laws, con&s;titutions, and threaten us with the &s;till further lo&s;s of our civil and religious liberties."</P>
<P>Every reader would imagine that the Centinel had &s;ome good foundation for &s;uch a terrible alarm&mdash;"of the lo&s;s of ci|vil and religious liberty," by the power of an American Bi&s;hop. It might be thought that &s;uch power could be grounded on &s;ome law, but I have &s;hewn that there is no &s;uch thing po&s;&s;ible. Or, again it might be thought at lea&s;t that the plan of the A|merican Epi&s;copate it&s;elf, propo&s;ed &s;ome &s;uch power; but quite the rever&s;e is the ca&s;e, and it is high time that this plan was now laid before the reader; who will be greatly &s;urpri&s;ed to find it the mo&s;t innocent thing, in&s;tead of being the mo&s;t dangerous. In &s;hort, the whole power propo&s;ed for an American Bi&s;hop, (and all he can po&s;&s;ibly exerci&s;e con&s;i&s;tent with our laws) a|mounts
<PB N="110" REF="011212_0060_0F862D65F05CAD20">to no more than is daily exerci&s;ed by any five or &s;ix of our clamorous adver&s;aries, within their bounds, in <HI>Pre&s;by|tery met.</HI></P>
<P>The plan for an American Bi&s;hop, which the Centinel mo&s;t di&s;ingenuou&s;ly &s;trives to per&s;uade the public is a <HI>"novel inven|tion"</HI> &s;et on foot by a few American clergy, at this particular time for particular purpo&s;es, is notwith&s;tanding a pretty <HI>old in|vention,</HI> &s;et on foot in no times of trouble or di&s;tre&s;s, and fir&s;t drawn up by no American clergyman, but by an Engli&s;h Pre|late, in who&s;e favour, even Dr. <HI>Mayhew</HI> has made an <HI>aberrati|on</HI> into candour; and forgetting his u&s;ual Bi&s;hop-baiting hu|mour, declares him a prelate who was a great ornament of the Epi&s;copal order, and of the Church of England."</P>
<P>It is the good <HI>Bi&s;hop Butler</HI> we &s;peak of, who in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> 1750, dige&s;ted and drew up the &s;cheme for an <HI>American Epi&s;|copate;</HI> a copy of which follows, taken from one in the Bi&s;hop's own hand, formerly in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>William Va&s;&s;al,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P N="1">"1. No coercive power is de&s;ired over the laity in any ca&s;e; but only a power to regulate the behaviour of the clergy who are in Epi&s;copal orders; and to correct and puni&s;h them ac|cording to the law of the Church of England, in ca&s;e of mi&s;|behaviour or neglect of duty; with &s;uch power as <HI>commi&s;&s;aries</HI> abroad have formerly exerci&s;ed; (over the clergy in the co|lonies.)</P>
<P N="2">"2. Nothing is de&s;ired for &s;uch <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> that may in the lea&s;t interfere with the dignity or authority, or <HI>intere&s;t</HI> of the GOVERNORS, or any other officers of State. The probate for wills, licences for marriages, &amp;c. are to be left in the hands where they now are; and no &s;hare of temporal government is de&s;ired for Bi&s;hops.</P>
<P N="3">3. The colonies are to be at no charge in the maintenance of the Bi&s;hop.</P>
<P N="4">4. No Bi&s;hops are intended to be &s;ettled in places where the government is in the hands of di&s;&s;enters, as in New-England, &amp;c.&mdash;But authority to be given only to ordain clergy for &s;uch Church of England congregations as are among them, to confirm the members of the &s;ame, and to in&s;pect into the man|ners and behaviour of their clergy."</P>

And all the&s;e great Prelates, who certainly knew the principles of the Church of England as well as the Centinel, thought it not in the lea&s;t "incon&s;i&s;tent with her principles," to have an American Bi&s;hop, merely "for ordaining Mini&s;ters, confirming youth, and vi&s;iting our own Clergy," without any government what&s;oever over the Laity, leaving each congrega|tion to be governed, in its &s;piritual affairs, by its own <HI>Pre&s;byter,</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Ve&s;tries, as at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be glad to know what is incon&s;i&s;tent or impo&s;&s;ible <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, to u&s;e the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Landaff</HI>'s words&mdash; <Q><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he fear?

<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> certainly none of the&s;e things could be done by them.

<P>What then can be the ground of the Centinel's apprehen&s;ion of the de&s;truction of our "charters, laws, and very con&s;titu|tions" by the introduction of a Bi&s;hop?

For though he has ju&s;t acknowledged that the Church &s;uffers Di&s;&s;enters in England to wor&s;hip God <HI>peaceably, according to their con&s;ciences,</HI> yet in this number he declares <HI>that they are oppre&s;&s;ed by the Church, regardle&s;s of the rights of con&s;cience.</HI></P>
<P>"Do you expect &s;ays he to Dr. Chandler) we can lay a&s;ide all jealou&s;y of a Church, which we &s;ee <HI>oppre&s;&s;ing</HI> all others both in England and the Colonies, in &s;uch flagrant in&s;tances, regardle&s;s of the rights of con&s;cience, &amp;c?"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Centinel No.</HI> 5.</NOTE> Let the kind reader try to reconcile this with the former paragraph.</P>
<P>But the&s;e are not the only in&s;tances where the <HI>Centinel</HI> hath blown <HI>cold</HI> and <HI>hot,</HI> and contradicted in one place what he hath confidently a&s;&s;erted in another. For in this &s;ame good humour|ed paper No. 3, where he has made &s;ome "aberrations into truth"&mdash;a thing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> remarkable in him than if he had made the&s;e contrary aberrations" which Mr. Living&s;ton ac|cu&s;es a Bi&s;hop with; I &s;ay in this good humoured No. 3, we find the following acknowledgment, viz.</P>
<P><Q>It is <HI>evident</HI> that to maintain the <HI>toleration,</HI> and &s;upport the rights of con&s;cience, the government has been care|ful to promote in the Church, men of <HI>moderation</HI> ONLY.</Q></P>
<P>But before he gets thro' No. 4, his good humour and cha|rity wholly de&s;ert him; the Church is <HI>filled</HI> again with men, who&s;e temper is quite the rever&s;e of <HI>moderation</HI>&mdash;men who&s;e &s;pirit of per&s;ecution is ready to flame out in all its wont|ed rage&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>They mu&s;t (&s;ays he) give the world &s;ome more &s;ub&s;tan|tial proofs of their <HI>peaceable</HI> forbearing temper, than their advocate Dr. Chandler's word, before we can believe that the &s;pirit of per&s;ecution is not yet alive in the Church, and would not flame out again, in all its wonted rage, if they were but allowed to exerci&s;e the powers they claim</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="011212_0061_0F862D66A5648280">Here now the poor man &s;eems in a great fright, but a little afterwards, in the &s;ame number, he recovers him&s;elf and ap|pears very well content&mdash;that the&s;e "exorbitant powers (which had &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ed his imagination) are limitted by the &s;a|lutary re&s;traints of &s;ome modern &s;tatutes&mdash;the wings of the&s;e high-flyers have been cropt," &amp;c.</P>
<P>What can be &s;aid to a man that &s;eems thus <HI>afraid</HI> and not <HI>a|fraid,</HI> that retracts in one place what he a&s;&s;erts in another, and that puts improbable, if not impo&s;&s;ible ca&s;es, and in the&s;e ca&s;es, cries out to have &s;ecurity for <HI>negatives,</HI> viz. that &s;uch and &s;uch things &s;hould not happen?</P>
<P>If the <HI>Centinel</HI> writes to be believed when he declares, <Q>the government hath been careful to promote in the Church, men of moderation <HI>only;</HI></Q> that "many" (he might have &s;aid the far greate&s;t part) of the Church clergy are advocates for "Toleration;" that "the wings of high-flyers are cropt;" that they are not <Q>allowed to exerci&s;e the powers they claim; but are limitted by the &s;alutary re&s;traints of &s;ome modern Statutes</Q>&mdash;I &s;ay, if he be in earne&s;t in the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions, which, indeed, the invincible force of truth, and facts notori|ous, &s;eem to have extorted from him; then he hath the very &s;e|curity he de&s;ires&mdash;a &s;ecurity <HI>more &s;ub&s;tantial than the word</HI> of an hundred Dr. <HI>Chandlers</HI>&mdash;even a &s;ecurity equal to what we have for life, limb and property, viz, the faith of government, and the &s;anctity of law and charters. For if "the &s;alutary re&s;traints of modern Statutes" are able to prevent per|&s;ecutions, and &s;ecure liberty of con&s;cience in a country where Bi&s;hops are clothed with legal powers; what can be appre|hended from them in a country where the &s;ame laws for liberty of con&s;cience have their fulle&s;t force, and yet no law that can ve&s;t a Bi&s;hop with the lea&s;t temporal power over the Laity doth extend?</P>
<P>But altho' this be demon&s;trably true; and altho' the Cen|tinel, by his own conce&s;&s;ions, hath cut him&s;elf out of every ground of <HI>apprehen&s;ion;</HI> yet, for all this, he will be <HI>apprehen|&s;ive</HI> &s;till&mdash;<Q>Suppo&s;ing (&s;ays he) the&s;e Bi&s;hops &s;ent over with the&s;e limitted powers, is there any probability they will remain <HI>content</HI> with them?</Q> Ju&s;t &s;uch another que&s;tion as this did our Centinel's great Prototype, Dr. <HI>Mayhew</HI> put, upon being told that the "Bi&s;hops are now, and have long been, as quiet an order of men as any in the nation."&mdash;But who knows whether they will continue &s;o? And the &s;ame an&s;wer that was given Dr. <HI>Mayhew,</HI> will &s;erve his di&s;ciple, the Cen|tinel.&mdash;Who can know with certainty any &s;uch thing con|cerning any per&s;on what&s;oever?" Who knows whether the

<P>But I forbear pur&s;uing this argument for the pre&s;ent; as it might ju&s;tly be replied, that there is no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e any &s;uch things; the times and tempers of men being much changed&mdash;Why then may not the &s;ame reply be admitted on our &s;ide? What &s;ignifies it to &s;ay that a Bi&s;hop in America will not be long <HI>contented</HI> with limitted powers, any more than to &s;ay, that independents, &amp;c. will not be long contented with them? Are our laws and con&s;titutions, and charters to be an|nulled for the <HI>contentment</HI> of either &s;ide? And certainly this mu&s;t be done before either can exerci&s;e the lea&s;t eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction over the other.</P>
<P>For &s;hame! that people cannot argue, as they would wi&s;h to be argued with, Is it fair, is it brotherly in any &s;ett of men, to keep up an eternal clamour, in order to deprive their fellow prote&s;tants of a natural right, merely on account of old grudges, that ought long &s;ince to have been done away; or on account of groundle&s;s fears, concerning what <HI>may,</HI> or never <HI>may</HI> happen?</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Mayhew,</HI> on further con&s;ideration, &s;aw the unfairne&s;s of &s;uch a conduct, and in his &s;econd piece &s;ays&mdash;<Q>It is rea|dily owned that our <HI>apprehen&s;ions</HI> of what may <HI>po&s;&s;ibly</HI> or <HI>probably</HI> be the con&s;equence of &s;ending Bi&s;hops to America, ought not to put us on infringing the religious liberty of our fellow &s;ubjects, and Chri&s;tian brethren; neither have we any power to do &s;o, if we were unrea&s;onable and wicked enough to de&s;ire it, our charter granting &s;uch liberty <HI>to all Pro|te&s;tants.</HI></Q></P>
<P>If the Centinel could have the virtue to make the like con|fe&s;&s;ion, it might bring this di&s;pute to a &s;peedy conclu&s;ion.

<HEAD>From the PENNSYLVANIA JOURNAL, Dec. 8. The CENTINEL, No. XXI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>To the</HI> CENTINEL.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Congratulate you on your e&s;cape from the bloody knife of the Anatomi&s;t, who, after paying his vi&s;it to the <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>The town of Bo&s;ton de&s;ired the clergy to &s;et apart a day of &s;olemn fa&s;ting and prayer; which reque&s;t was cheerfully complied with by every denomination except Epi&s;copalians.</HI></NOTE> <HI>patrio|tic</HI> Epi&s;copalians of Bo&s;ton, and <HI>di&s;&s;ecting</HI> a <HI>Watch-Tower</HI> in New-York, intended to have &s;eized you in your &s;leep, cut you up alive as you were, and expo&s;ed you as a &s;care-crow to fright|en his oppo&s;ers into a tame &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his darling Epi&s;co|pate. I am an entire &s;tranger to your per&s;on, and know not whether you be a Pre&s;byterian or Quaker, Independent or Epi&s;|copalian farther than as appears from your writings; yet the cau&s;e of truth makes me your friend, in oppo&s;ition to &s;ome ambitious &s;pirits, who have been fea&s;ting their fancies that the day is dawning, when the knowledge of epi&s;copacy &s;hall &s;pread through the land, and an American Bi&s;hop &s;hining in full &s;plendour, &s;hall gild and gladden nations with his beams.</P>
<P>The memorable Appeal has long &s;ince made its appearance in this new world: by &s;ome it was viewed as a portentous &s;tranger, foreboding all the horrors of eccle&s;ia&s;tical tyranny; by others as a &s;pecimen of Church moderation and lenity; and by all acknowledged to have the cunning of the &s;erpent, as well as the harmle&s;&s;ne&s;s of the dove. Various have been the refutations of that celebrated performance, to the no &s;mall &s;atisfaction of all moderate men, and the la&s;ting vexation and angui&s;h of our American Tories, who, in the agony of their &s;pirits, talk of "re&s;i&s;tance unto blood," and con&s;equently of dying martyrs in the wild cau&s;e of their good ma&s;ter ap|pellant.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="011212_0063_0F862D684991CC70">So copious of ab&s;urdities and contradictions, &s;o abundant in reflections on his oppo&s;ers, is Dr. Chandler's appeal to the pub|lic, that no with&s;tanding all that has been &s;aid in reply, there is &s;till remaining &s;o much worthy of animadver&s;ion that vo|lumes might be written, and his Maje&s;ty's liege &s;ubjects might &s;till be diverted for ages yet to come.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t unfavourable are the times for &s;uch controver&s;ies, and every friend to liberty mu&s;t lament that a number of ambitious mi&s;&s;ionaries could rai&s;e &s;o di&s;agreeable a di&s;pute, when our pub|lic affairs call for the clo&s;e&s;t union in councils and uniformity in mea&s;ures. It is to be hoped however, as the Anatomi&s;t "&s;corns to fall to &s;la&s;hing without calling one to &s;tand on one's guard," that he will de&s;i&s;t from his purpo&s;e and endea|vour to heal the wounds he may have made, provided it can be made appear that Doctor <HI>Chandler</HI> "<HI>was</HI> the aggre&s;&s;or" in this di&s;pute about Bi&s;hops&mdash;that "Dr. Chandler <HI>had</HI> a general commi&s;&s;ion from his own brethren" the clergy of New-York and New-Jer&s;ey, and, if his own words are true, and we under&s;tand the terms <HI>commi&s;&s;ion</HI> and <HI>repre&s;entation</HI> as the con|vention did&mdash;that Doctor Chandler "had a commi&s;&s;ion from the Church," and is therefore, in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, "the Church of England" it&s;elf, and con&s;equently much more than "the ten thou&s;andth part of it." All which I now undertake to prove, although the Anatomi&s;t denies it, and has the impu|dence to &s;ay "this is not pretended." I will al&s;o &s;how that 'tis fal&s;e to &s;ay Doctor Chandler has given no provocation" for "the treatment he has met with," as the Anatomi&s;t boldly a&s;|&s;erts is the ca&s;e. I will prove too that the Doctor has "ut|tered" much more than "a &s;ingle word, reflecting on the prin|ciples" not only "of any" but of every "prote&s;tant denomina|tion" on the continent, not even &s;paring his own, e&s;pecially the unlucky laity.</P>
<P>In the pro&s;ecution of this plan I &s;hall take the following things for granted, which none, except the Anatomi&s;t, will venture to deny: 1. That Doctor Chandler knew what was his de&s;ign in writing his Appeal better than the Anatomi&s;t can be &s;uppo&s;ed to do: And 2. That when Doctor Chandler expre&s;&s;|ly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> he does or &s;ays a thing with this or the other par|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iew and the Anatomi&s;t fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tly contradicts him, the A|natomi&s;t mu&s;t then be &s;uppo&s;ed to be wrong&mdash;with the&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> proceed to prove. 1&s;t. That Doctor Chandler, far from being a defendant in any di&s;pute commenced again&s;t his Church, is in fact the aggre&s;&s;or. But here, Sir, I find my&s;elf antici|pated in your la&s;t week's paper, and &s;hall only refer your rea|der's to the Doctor's <HI>dedication, adverti&s;ement to the reader,</HI>
<PB N="117" REF="011212_0063_0F862D684991CC70">and <HI>introduction</HI> to the Appeal, for a full confirmation of this point. I &s;hall here only pre&s;ent to view what the Doctor &s;ays in his <HI>adverti&s;ement to the public</HI> in the Penn&s;ylvania Journal, No. 13<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">1. <Q>The principal de&s;ign of the appeal (&s;ays he) was to <HI>a&s;&s;ign</HI> the <HI>rea&s;ons</HI> for which the members of the Church of England in America are de&s;irous of having Bi|&s;hops to re&s;ide in this country, to <HI>&s;tate</HI> and <HI>explain</HI> the <HI>plan</HI> on which alone American Bi&s;hops have been propo&s;ed and re|que&s;ted, and to obviate and confute the objections that <HI>might be &s;uppo&s;ed to ari&s;e in the minds</HI> of any again&s;t &s;uch an e|pi&s;copate.</Q> Where is there in all this or any other part of his writings any hint of entering into any commenced con|trover&s;y? How then could the Anatomi&s;t utter &s;o fal&s;e an a&s;&s;er|tion? I now defy him and his a&s;&s;ociates to produce a &s;ingle &s;en|tence in the body of the appeal that has the lea&s;t appearance of a &s;et defence again&s;t any New England antagoni&s;ts. So far from it, that the Doctor's profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign is to explain what him&s;elf &s;eems to acknowledge, and is now univer&s;ally known, was "kept as a &s;ecret." So far from it, that he appears &s;ome|what &s;urpri&s;ed that any "per&s;ons are" even "&s;aid to be alarm|ed at this conduct of the clergy. He goes farther, he &s;ays that <Q>when the ca&s;e is duly explained and under&s;tood, it is not apprehended that <HI>any</HI> oppo&s;ition <HI>can be formed</HI> again&s;t the execution of a plan &s;o rea&s;onable,</Q> &amp;c. This &s;ame plan, to <HI>explain</HI> which is the <HI>expre&s;s</HI> de&s;ign of the appeal, the Doctor always mentions as a matter the public did not under&s;tand, which had never been debated, and for a thorough di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of which <Q>all are invited to propo&s;e their objections, that they may be fairly and candidly debated before the tribunal of the public.</Q> If therefore it fully appears that Doctor Chan|dler is not a defendant in any di&s;pute commenced again&s;t his Church, pray Mr. Anatomi&s;t, who was the aggre&s;&s;or? and how ridiculou&s;ly have you &s;pent your time in writing &s;even long papers to prove a point in which you are &s;o flatly contradicted by the author of the Appeal, who without doubt mu&s;t be &s;up|po&s;ed to know be&s;t his own de&s;ign in writing it?&mdash;But &s;uppo&s;e Doctor Chandler had been only a defendant in this di&s;pute, does he not invite all to propo&s;e their objections, and can the Centinel be blamed for accepting the challenge? I cannot but ob&s;erve here the Doctor's craft. Notwith&s;tanding this his &s;eemingly fair invitation to a fair and candid debate before the public tribunal, he takes care previou&s;ly to brand any that might oppo&s;e him with the name of per&s;ecutors. <Q>Every oppo&s;ition to &s;uch a plan (&s;ays help. 82) has the na|ture of per&s;ecution, and de&s;erves the name:</Q> Nay he goes
<PB N="118" REF="011212_0064_0F862D68E3C71690">farther he calls it "per&s;ecuting them for their religious princi|ples," and that too "when no rea&s;ons of &s;tate require it;" and at la&s;t he boldly pronounces it "per&s;ecution in the &s;trict|e&s;t and propere&s;t &s;en&s;e." Under penalty of &s;o heavy a charge who would have ventured to attack the Doctor? But greater evils await our &s;ilence. He tells us (p. 2) "if no objections &s;hall be offered it will be taken for granted that all parties ac|quie&s;ce and are &s;atisfied." A fine dilemma,&mdash;to oppo&s;e the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of a Bi&s;hop, is per&s;ecution: not to oppo&s;e it, is to acquie&s;ce and be &s;atisfied with it! Surpri&s;ing! that a man mu&s;t be thought &s;atisfied with whatever he does not oppo&s;e, and what he has perhaps never heard of. I am apt to imagine that the Doctor is by this time pretty well convinced, that if all that were di&s;&s;atisfied with his &s;cheme were to oppo&s;e him, he would bring the whole continent about his ears.</P>
<P>I am next to &s;hew that Dr. Chandler had a general commi&s;|&s;ion from his brethren the clergy of New-York and New-Jer&s;ey, and, in the convention's &s;en&s;e of the terms <HI>commi&s;&s;ion</HI> and <HI>re|pre&s;entation,</HI> that Dr. Chandler had a commi&s;&s;ion from the church, and is therefore in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e of the terms before|mentioned, the church of England it&s;elf, and con&s;equently much more than the ten thou&s;andth part of it. Fir&s;t then, that Dr. Chandler had a general commi&s;&s;ion from his brethren, appears from his own words in his <HI>adverti&s;ement to the reader;</HI> where he tells us, as an apology for the Appeal, <Q>that he was re|que&s;ted by many of his brethren to undertake it&mdash;that the ta&s;k was fir&s;t impo&s;ed upon him by the very worthy and Revd. Dr. John&s;on, of Stratford, in Connecticut;</Q> and adds that "at the time when this treaty," as he pompou&s;ly calls it, <Q>was nearly concluded, the clergy of New-York and New-Jer&s;ey, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;ome of their brethren from the neighbour|ing provinces took into con&s;ideration, &amp;c. And after a tho|rough di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the point, they were unanimou&s;ly of opi|nion, that fairly to explain the plan, &amp;c. was a matter of nece&s;&s;ity and duty. It was accordingly voted (&s;ays he) that &s;omething to this purpo&s;e &s;hould be publi&s;hed and the <HI>author</HI> was <HI>appointed</HI> to the &s;ervice.</Q> Here we have an <HI>expre&s;s ap|pointment</HI> from the convention: and it appears they were ur|gent and almo&s;t laid their commands on him: <Q>excu&s;es (&s;ays the Doctor) were not admitted, and a refu&s;al could not be ju&s;tified.</Q> So far was the Doctor from acting in di&s;connection with the convention, that he tells us <Q>he was careful to follow the directions he had received, and to con&s;ult the mo&s;t judi|cious of his friends in regard to the method and manage|ment of the work.</Q> Hence it appears that the Dr. had not only a commi&s;&s;ion for, but direction in his publication, and
<PB N="119" REF="011212_0064_0F862D68E3C71690">that the appeal is the product of the united efforts of the Right Reverendly inclined clergy of the provinces of York and Jer&s;ey in full convention met.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be allowed, by the members of the convention at lea&s;t, that they have acted (whether lawfully or not, I leave them&s;elves to determine) as the repre&s;entatives of all the Epi&s;co|palians on the continent. This they mu&s;t allow, or highly condemn their own conduct, in &s;ending over no le&s;s than &s;even petitions in the name of near a million of Epi&s;copalians, there|in including eight hundred and forty four thou&s;and negroes, all of whom Dr. Chandler repre&s;ents as at lea&s;t virtual mem|bers of the church of England, though he at the &s;ame time acknowledges that <Q>many of the&s;e it is to be feared are not Chri&s;tians at all.</Q> Now as the convention are, in their re|pre&s;entative capacity (&s;o often made u&s;e of in their petitions) the church of England in America (as they phra&s;e it) then Dr. Chandler in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, as their repre&s;entative in the Ap|peal, is the convention, and therefore is in like manner the church of England it&s;elf, and con&s;equently much more than the ten thou&s;andth part of it. <HI>Quod erat demon|&s;trandum.</HI></P>
<P>It is hoped the re&s;pectable laity, who have been &s;o much a|bu&s;ed by the Doctor, and the unambitious clergymen of that church, will not be offended at the liberty here taken in &s;peak|ing of the convention as their repre&s;entatives, as they may be a&s;&s;ured nothing farther is intended than to treat with the Dr. and his brethren of the convention, in the &s;tyle they are found to u&s;e and have a&s;&s;umed in their &s;even petitions. We as fully di&s;believe their pre&s;ent right to act in the name of the American Epi&s;copalians, as the Epi&s;copalians them&s;elves can do, and we hope never to be &s;u&s;pected to the contrary.</P>
<P>Mr. Centinel, if you think this worthy of a place in your papers, I &s;hall write to you again, and intend in my next to &s;hew the Anatomi&s;t, that Dr. Chandler has given great provo|cation, and reflected highly on every prote&s;tant denomination on the continent, not even &s;paring his own church, and that you are therefore entirely ju&s;tifiable in defending their injured cha|racters.</P>

<P>IN an&s;wer to what is called the Centinel's arguments, which con&s;i&s;t chiefly of vain &s;urmi&s;es, I have &s;hewn in part, and may perhaps &s;hew more at large, that if the faults of former times are to be again brought to view, there is no people on earth who&s;e intolerant, per&s;ecuting, a&s;piring &s;pirit ought more ju&s;tly to be dreaded by all prote&s;tants, than his own party; who although they are of various &s;ects, and their <HI>heads</HI> look different ways, yet, like <HI>Samp&s;on</HI>'s foxes, their <HI>tails</HI> have always been <HI>joined,</HI> to carry fire-brands into the corn-fields and vineyards of their neithbours.</P>
<P>The di&s;tinction hath been &s;ufficiently made between tho&s;e powers of government, e&s;&s;ential to every Chri&s;tian Church; and tho&s;e adventitious powers derived from human laws. The <HI>for|mer</HI> the Church of England is entitled to, in common with all other churches here. And the <HI>latter,</HI> (it hath been demon&s;tra|bly &s;hewn) an American Bi&s;hop cannot enjoy, till our laws, charters, and con&s;titutions are fir&s;t totally &s;et a&s;ide. To &s;up|po&s;e, then, that all this will be done, and to offer it as an ar|gument for denying us a ju&s;t and natural right, is too futile to de&s;erve further notice. Even Doctor Mayhew blu&s;hed at &s;uch an argument, and retracted it; nor would our antagoni&s;ts think it fair to be deprived of any right of theirs, on the like vain pre&s;umptions.</P>
<P>The Remon&s;trant's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though I mention the <HI>Remon&s;trant,</HI> yet (if I mi&s;take not) all the&s;e feigned names of <HI>Remon&s;trant, Irenicus, An|ti-Centinel</HI> and even the Centinel's new corre&s;pondent <HI>Philan|der,</HI> &s;tand only for the Centinel's own <HI>dear &s;elf;</HI> wriggling, and twi&s;ting, and &s;tarting up in various &s;hapes, under the yet gentle touches of what he calls a <HI>bloody knife.</HI> If this con|jecture be ju&s;t, he hath little to boa&s;t of his patience. For though it is well known that he had near half a year's long run, before he was ever interrupted with a &s;ingle reply; yet the <HI>Anatomi&s;t</HI> hath &s;carce ever been &s;uffered to &s;ee three weeks to|gether, without &s;omething written <HI>at</HI> him and <HI>at</HI> him. But in what|ever &s;hape the Centinel and his journeymen, if he has any, may choo&s;e to write, and however many papers they may publi&s;h, they may &s;till expect to be an&s;wered, were it for &s;even years longer, till they &s;uffer the <HI>Church</HI> to enjoy her ju&s;t rights in peace.</NOTE> argument that judges <HI>may</HI> be intimi|dated
<PB N="121" REF="011212_0065_0F862D6DE837FD70">to wre&s;t the laws, &amp;c. is equally ab&s;urd, and admits of the like an&s;wer, viz. that no men ought to be deprived of their rights on account of the bare &s;urmi&s;es of others. It was formerly more than &s;urmi&s;ed that <HI>Pre&s;bytery</HI> could never be &s;afe in <HI>Scotland,</HI> if <HI>Epi&s;copacy</HI> was &s;uffered in <HI>England;</HI> and yet time has &s;hewn that this was a groundle&s;s as well as uncharita|ble pre&s;umption. If the laws of the land will not bind Judges as well as Bi&s;hops. I can offer no further &s;ecurity for either, unle&s;s I was to advi&s;e our antagoni&s;ts to do with the former, as it is &s;aid &s;ome of them have threatened to do with the latter, viz.&mdash;"to throw them into the fir&s;t river or ditch, when they violate the laws.</P>
<P>By the plan for an American Epi&s;copate, which hath been fairly publi&s;hed, no other power is de&s;ired than that of ordina|tion, confirmation, and &s;uch government of the clergy as is de|rived from the Church and the laws of canonical obedience. As to the laity, it hath been again and again &s;hewn, that no law in force in the&s;e colonies, can give a Bi&s;hop any power over them greater than every Pre&s;byter of every denomination hath over his own pa&s;toral charge. And if the laws in being are not ex|plicit enough on this head, we have no objection, if every a&s;&s;em|bly of every colony, &s;hould by new laws, tie our Bi&s;hop hand and foot, if they think it nece&s;&s;ary, provided they leave him tho&s;e powers mentioned above, which are on all &s;ides (confir|mation excepted) judged e&s;&s;ential to a Chri&s;tian church; and which our church thinks proper to place in a <HI>&s;ingle</HI> per&s;on, and not in <HI>many.</HI> As to any natural di&s;po&s;ition in epi&s;copalians more than in others, to violate laws, I think the whole world, one party excepted, will acquit them; and for <HI>one</HI> violation of law by Epi&s;copalians, I am ready, if de&s;ired, to produce <HI>ten</HI> on the &s;ide of that party them&s;elves, where ever they had power.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="011212_0066_0F862D6F395D7490">Having made this brief recapitulation of what has been the &s;ub&s;tance of &s;undry of my former papers, I now follow the <HI>Cen|tinel</HI> to &s;ome other parts of his performance. For not content with the hideous character he has given us of the Bi&s;hops and government of our Church, he hath, with a &s;pirit and charity, becoming&mdash;him&s;elf, in order &s;till better to carry his point, thought fit to vilify our <HI>Church</HI> it&s;elf, as &s;carce fit to be tolerated in a <HI>prote&s;tant</HI> land, having "corrupted and ob&s;cured the pure word of God with human inventions."</P>
<P>I have more than once had occa&s;ion to complain of the Cen|tinel for laying down his charges and a&s;&s;ertions in a way &s;o loo&s;e, general and unmanly, that they will &s;carce admit of a particu|lar an&s;wer. Thus he acted in &s;preading his <HI>general</HI> alarm about American Bi&s;hops. He gave us no particular grounds of his fears, &s;o that I was forced to con&s;ider every po&s;&s;ible ground. The &s;ame way he acts here. He does not tell what tho&s;e "hu|man inventions are, wherewith our Church hath corrupted and ob&s;cured the pure word of God;" and I am left to gue&s;s whe|ther he means in point of <HI>Epi&s;copal government</HI> it&s;elf, or in rites, ceremonies, and points of doctrine. But if we examine the field from whence his generous hand hath culled &s;ome of its choice&s;t flowers to deck the Church with, we may pre&s;ume that the whole together, our di&s;cipline, government, rites, &amp;c. are a <HI>&s;moak</HI> in his <HI>no&s;trils,</HI> like as they were in the <HI>no&s;trils</HI> of the old calumniators he hath copied; and that he is afraid of be|ing funked to death with the rank &s;mell which they retain of the ancient whore!</P>
<P>To general charges, in this ca&s;e, it may be &s;ufficient to give general an&s;wers; and to make <HI>one appeal to the</HI> CHURCH <HI>of</HI> PROTESTANTS, to &s;ee how &s;he hath expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf;&mdash;1&s;t. Concerning epi&s;copal government;&mdash;2d. Concerning the rites, ceremonies, and doctrines of the CHURCH of ENG|LAND. If the Centinel (as my Latin motto hath it) <HI>will not hear truth,</HI> from tho&s;e <HI>reformed Churches</HI> abroad, whom he mu&s;t con&s;ider by his own principles, as <HI>friends,</HI> nearly allied to his own party, <HI>I mu&s;t de&s;pair</HI> of his conviction.</P>
<P>This appeal may be unnece&s;&s;ary of tho&s;e who have the books from which the Centinel hath <HI>kuck&s;tered</HI> out his &s;candal, or the an&s;wers that hath been given by learned divines of the Church of England. But the generality of readers, in this country may not have either the one or the other. They may not know that the Centinel's villainous charge again&s;t the Church, of having "corrupted and ob&s;cured the pure word of
<PB N="123" REF="011212_0066_0F862D6F395D7490">God with human inventions, hath been an&s;wered over and over again, and &s;tands refuted by the te&s;timonies of almo&s;t every <HI>re|formed</HI> denomination of Chri&s;tians upon earth, except a few re&s;tle&s;s <HI>fanatics</HI> in our own country. It is fit, therefore, &s;ince this writer hath raked up this charge again from the old lumber of refuted pamphlets, that inqui&s;itive readers, churchmen, e&s;|pecially, &s;hould be &s;atisfied on this head, le&s;t impudent a&s;&s;erti|ons &s;hould pa&s;s for truth on the one &s;ide, and &s;ilence be con&s;ider|ed as inability to an&s;wer, on the other.</P>
<P>As to the order and in&s;titution of Bi&s;hops, and government by them, I am now to corroborate what I have &s;aid in my for|mer papers, by the te&s;timonies of the <HI>reformed</HI> abroad; and then proceed to give the like te&s;timonies with re&s;pect to rites, ceremonies, and the purity of the doctrines of our Church; for if the Centinel could &s;ucceed in damning her whole reputation as yet <HI>impure</HI> and <HI>unreformed,</HI> it would be needle&s;s to hold any long conte&s;t about Bi&s;hops, or any thing el&s;e that concerns &s;uch a Church.</P>
<P>And now let us hear the &s;entiments of the fir&s;t reformers, and and &s;ee whether they agree with our Centinel, in con&s;idering Bi&s;hops as mon&s;ters, and Epi&s;copal government as dreadful, anti-Chri&s;tian, "the yoke of bondage," &amp;c.</P>
<P>LUTHER expre&s;&s;es great veneration for <HI>Prelacy,</HI> and di&s;tin|gui&s;hes betwixt popi&s;h tyrants and <HI>true Bi&s;hops,</HI> profe&s;&s;ing <Q>that he had no difference with them as <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> but as <HI>Po|pi&s;h,</HI> and ZANCHI (the compiler of the Gallican confe&s;&s;ion) ob&s;erves a change of <HI>name,</HI> rather than of office, in the <HI>&s;u|perintendents</HI> and <HI>general &s;uperintendents</HI> of the <HI>German</HI> Churches, the&s;e being only <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> and <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hops</HI> under di&s;gui&s;ed names,</Q> and he acknowledges further, that <Q>by the con&s;ent of hi&s;tories, councils, and ancient fathers, tho&s;e orders have been generally allowed by all Chri&s;tian &s;ocieties, that Epi&s;copacy is agreeable to the word of God:&mdash;that where it is in exerci&s;e it ought to be continued, and where by violence it hath been aboli&s;hed, it ought to be re&s;tored<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gall. Confe&s;&s;i.</HI></NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>CALVIN recommends the Hierarchy to the king of Poland; and &s;ays that <Q>the ancient government by <HI>Arch-bi&s;hops</HI> and <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> and the Nicence con&s;titution of <HI>Patriarchs</HI> was for orders &s;ake and good government.</Q>&mdash;The &s;ame great man,
<PB N="124" REF="011212_0067_0F862D700B79DDC0">in his treati&s;e concerning the nece&s;&s;ity of the reformation, &s;ays&mdash;<Q>Give us &s;uch an hierarchy, in which Bi&s;hops pre&s;ide, who are &s;ubject to Chri&s;t, and <HI>him alone,</HI> as their only head, and then I will own no cur&s;e too bad for him that &s;hall not pay the utmo&s;t re&s;pect to &s;uch an hierarchy as this.</Q> And when he was called to an account by Cardinal <HI>Sadolet</HI> concern|ing the <HI>Geneva</HI> defection, and for &s;ub&s;cribing the <HI>Augu&s;tan con|fe&s;&s;ion,</HI> he repeats, that he <Q>&s;hould think every man de&s;erving the wor&s;t cur&s;e who would not be &s;ubject to &s;uch an hierarchy as that above.</Q></P>
<P>Now &s;uch an hierarchy as this, is what hath been propo&s;ed to take place in the Epi&s;copal Churches in the colonies; for the words of Calvin&mdash;"Bi&s;hops &s;ubject to Chri&s;t alone"&mdash;do not mean Bi&s;hops who reject the &s;upremacy of the &s;tate, wherein they live, with re&s;pect to <HI>affairs</HI> eccle&s;ia&s;tical, under Chri&s;t; but &s;uch as deny their &s;ubjection to the <HI>Pope,</HI> as the &s;ole &s;piritual head of the Church, &amp;c. on earth. For <HI>Calvin,</HI> is known to have made u&s;e of the &s;ecular authority where ever he could obtain it in aid of the e&s;tabli&s;hment of his di&s;cipline; and &s;ome of his followers in the reformed <HI>French Church,</HI> as for example, Mon&s;ieur <HI>Daille</HI> &s;till further explains his meaning in this place.</P>
<P><Q>CALVIN him&s;elf, &s;ays he, honoured <HI>all</HI> Bi&s;hops, <HI>that were not &s;ubjects of the Pope,</HI> and taught the pure and &s;in|cere doctrines of the Apo&s;tles&mdash;&s;uch as were the Prelates of England, <HI>Cranmer, Hooper,</HI> &amp;c. We our&s;elves al&s;o have ever maintained, and do &s;till maintain the &s;ame Chri&s;tian communion in faith and charity with their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors&mdash;We confe&s;s that the foundation of their charge is <HI>good and lawful, e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Apo&s;tles, according to the command of Chri&s;t.</HI></Q><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Replique <HI>a Me&s;&s;ieurs Adam and Cottiby.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>The like te&s;timony of <HI>Calvin</HI>'s regard to our Church, and her government by Bi&s;hops is given by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Del' Angle</HI> mini&s;ter of the French Church at Charenton, in a letter to the Bi&s;hop of London, 1680.</P>
<P><Q>Since the Church of England is a TRUE CHURCH of our LORD; &s;ince her <HI>wor&s;hip</HI> and <HI>doctrines</HI> are PURE, and have nothing in them CONTRARY to the WORD of GOD; &s;ince the reformation [in England] was received together with Epi&s;copacy. the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the liturgy and ceremonies&mdash;it is, without doubt, the duty of all the <HI>reformed</HI> in

<P><Q>This was &s;o much the opinion of our great and excellent CALVIN,</Q> that he makes no difficulty to &s;ay, that if there &s;hould be any &s;o unrea&s;onable, as to refu&s;e the communion of <Q>a Church that was <HI>pure</HI> in its wor&s;hip and doctrine, and not &s;ubmit him&s;elf with re&s;pect to its government, under pre|tence that it hath retained an <HI>Epi&s;copacy qualified, as yours is,</HI> there would be no cen&s;ure nor rigor of di&s;cipline, that ought not to be exerci&s;ed upon them.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See this and other Te&s;timonies in Stillingfleet's Unrea&s;ona|blene&s;s of Separation&mdash;Bingham's Apology of the French Church, &amp;c.&mdash;For where the charge is <HI>old</HI> we have no need of new an&s;wers in a church that hath had &s;o many a|ble advocates.</NOTE></P>
<P>Here then is a very different te&s;timony concerning Bi&s;hops, Epi&s;copal government, the <HI>purity</HI> of our Church doctrines, &amp;c. from what the Centinel hath given; and that from the foun|ders and princes of his own party. As to what is &s;aid about the &s;in of Non-conformity to &s;uch a Church we urge not this matter, where there is no e&s;tabli&s;hment; and would be well content if the&s;e our bitter adver&s;aries would enjoy their own principles in quiet, and leave us to do the &s;ame, without de|&s;iring to tear our principles in pieces, and to deprive us of our ju&s;t and common rights as fellow Chri&s;tians&mdash;but to pro|ceed&mdash;</P>
<P>BEZA, &s;ome time the collegue, and afterwards the rigid &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or of CALVIN, was of the &s;ame mind with re&s;pect particu|larly to the Engli&s;h Bi&s;hops.&mdash;<Q>The Church of England, &s;ays he, after the reformation was &s;upported and &s;tood by the Authority of Arch-Bi&s;hops and Bi&s;hops, of which order &s;he had many, not only famous Martyrs, but excellent doc|tors and pa&s;tors; and may &s;he ever enjoy that &s;ingular ble&s;|&s;ing of God upon her<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bez. Re&s;p. ad Serav.</NOTE>." And in a dedication of his new te&s;tament to Queen Elizabeth he &s;ays&mdash;"England en|joys what perhaps no other kingdom does, the <HI>complete po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the</HI> PURE <HI>and &s;incere doctrine of the GOSPEL.</HI></Q></P>
<P>MONSIEUR LE MOYNE, a learned foreigner, and profe&s;&s;or of divinity at Leyden, delivers him&s;elf thus.&mdash;<Q>As to E|pi&s;copal
<PB N="126" REF="011212_0068_0F862D706335AFE8">government, what is there in it that is dangerous, and may rea&s;onably alarm mens con&s;ciences? If this be capa|ble of depriving us of eternal glory, and &s;hutting the gates of Heaven, who was there that entered there for the &s;pace of <HI>fifteen hundred years,</HI> &s;ince that for all that time, all the Churches of the world had no other &s;ort of government; Who was it for &s;o many ages, that made up the councils of the Church, as well general as particular?

<P>HOW little of the &s;pirit of tho&s;e <HI>non-conformi&s;ts,</HI> quoted in my motto, the Centinel is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, need not, by this time, be ob&s;erved to impartial readers. Far from allowing the <HI>Church</HI> of England the rank of ADMIRAL in the <HI>prote&s;tant fleet,</HI> he will not give her &s;o much as the privilege of a <HI>cock-boat;</HI> but is for turning her adrift without any commanding officer &s;he can acknowledge; and that too in a <HI>rotten and leaky</HI> con|dition; her whole works being "corrupted," &amp;c.&mdash;Cru|el and un-&s;ailor like man; that will not even take her in <HI>tow,</HI> but &s;eems de&s;irous to behold her &s;ink before his eyes!</P>
<P>That there is not the lea&s;t &s;hadow of ground, either in law or rea&s;on, for the clamour he hath &s;et up to deprive our Church in the colonies of her mode of governing and ordaining her own clergy, hath been amply &s;hewn; and I am now con&s;ider|ing the heavy charge of having "corrupted and ob&s;cured the
<PB N="128" REF="011212_0069_0F862D712B2C94F0">pure word of God with human inventions"&mdash;whereby he endeavours to complete his triumph over our Church, by repre|&s;enting her as unfit to have even a being, much le&s;s a well-being, among reformed Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>As this charge is general, I have thought it &s;ufficient to give it a general an&s;wer, and to &s;hew "that it &s;tands refuted by the <HI>te&s;timonies</HI> of almo&s;t every <HI>prote&s;tant</HI> denomination of men upon earth, except a few re&s;tle&s;s <HI>fanatics,</HI> in our own coun|try"&mdash;whether the Centinel means "corruption" in point of government, or in rites, ceremonies and doctrine.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t head, the pure and primitive nature of epi&s;co|pal government, I have in the preceding number, given &s;everal eminent te&s;timonies from <HI>Calvin</HI> him&s;elf, and &s;ome of the prin|cipal reformers abroad. I now add &s;ome others, before I proceed to the &s;econd point, and <HI>Calvin</HI> &s;hall once more lead the van.</P>
<P><Q>As we have &s;hewn, &s;ays he,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Calvin</HI>'s In&s;titutions, Sect. <HI>Chap. 4.</HI></NOTE> there is a three fold mini&s;try recommended to us, in the &s;cripture; &s;o whatever mini&s;ters the ancient church had, it di&s;tingui&s;hed them into three or|ders, bi&s;hops, pre&s;byters, and deacons.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>PETER DU MOULIN, an eminent profe&s;&s;or in the French Church, thus expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf&mdash;<Q>Touching eccle&s;ia&s;tical polity, we do not refu&s;e to acknowledge tho&s;e for <HI>pure</HI> and <HI>true</HI> Churches, where equality of mini&s;ters is not ob&s;erved&mdash;<HI>Peter Martyr, Calvin, Beza, Zanchius,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>Mon&s;ieur CLAUDE, another learned foreigner, writing to the bi&s;hop of London, candidly declares&mdash;<Q>We are &s;o very far from believing that a man cannot live with a good con&s;cience un|der your di&s;cipline, and <HI>epi&s;copal government,</HI> that in our ordinary practice we make no difficulty, neither to be&s;tow our chairs nor to commit the care of our flocks to mini&s;ters re|ceived and ordained by my Lords the <HI>bi&s;hops,</HI> as might be ju&s;tified by a great number of examples, both old and new.&mdash;</Q></P>

<P>It is remarkable above, that Mon&s;ieur <HI>Claude</HI> a&s;cribes their form of <HI>Pre&s;byterian government</HI> in their Churches, to that in|di&s;pen&s;ible nece&s;&s;ity, under which divine Providence put them, by the conjuncture of affairs at the Reformation; and not to any choice or preference of that form. And certain it is, that they would mo&s;t willingly have embraced Bi&s;hops as their governors, if they had not been hindered by the policy, or rather iniqui|ty, of the civil powers. This we are expre&s;sly told by Doctor Du MOULIN, &s;on of the famous PETER above-mentioned. In the preface to his father's book on the novelty of Popery.&mdash;<Q>There was, &s;ays he, a time when &s;ome of their prime men, feeling the inconveniencies that follow the want of eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal &s;ubordination, moved Cardinal Richlieu to place it among them; who flatly denied to give way to it, &s;aying, <HI>if you had that order you would look too like a</HI> CHURCH.</Q></P>
<P>Nay Peter Martyr (Epi&s;t. 57 ad Bez.) and al&s;o the &s;ame Doctor Du MOULIN, tells us that the reformed Church in the bi&s;hoprick of Troyes, as &s;oon as the prelate began to for&s;ake the errors of property, did <Q>unanimou&s;ly acknowledge and re|ceive him as a true Bi&s;hop and their dioce&s;an; and his au|thority and piety did great &s;ervice to the Church of Chri&s;t. Prai&s;ed be God, (continues <HI>Martyr</HI>) who takes the&s;e methods to govern and advance the kingdom of his &s;on.</Q></P>
<P>In &s;hort, it was only the <HI>&s;tate,</HI> and not their <HI>religious per&s;ua|&s;ion,</HI> that prevented the French prote&s;tants from having Epi&s;co|pal government. For the afore&s;aid Bi&s;hop of <HI>Troyes,</HI> Cardi|nal <HI>Ca&s;tilion</HI> and <HI>Sangela&s;ius</HI> having turned prote&s;tants, and continued to act as Bi&s;hops among the reformed Churches for &s;ome time, <Q>were forced by the &s;ecular power to with|draw and betake them&s;elves to a private &s;tation.</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Bingham's French Church's Apology, who cites Spon|danus, Thuanus, &amp;c. as his authorities.</NOTE></P>

Could a Pre&s;byter of ours, now, or a Pre&s;byter of our antagoni&s;ts, u&s;urp the whole government and right of ordination over them and us, through this whole continent, and no oppo&s;ition be made; no record remain of the change, or no hi&s;tory be left to tell it to po&s;terity?

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN my fir&s;t number, it was ob&s;erved that the opponents of the Church have nothing to do with that mode of government and di&s;cipline which Epi&s;copalians choo&s;e for them&s;elves in A|merica, unle&s;s &s;ome probability could be &s;hewn (which hath never yet been done) of its interfering with the rights of others; and that, whether of divine or human original, it is enough for us to an&s;wer, that it is &s;uch a government as we prefer; pay, &s;uch as many wi&s;e men ever have, and probably ever will, pre|fer to the modern government of Pre&s;bytery, which (agreea|able to the words of Chillingworth in my la&s;t) one can no more believe to have been in u&s;e "during the Apo&s;tles' times and pre|&s;ently afterwards (contrary to their doctrine and the will of Chri&s;t) to have been whirled about like a &s;cene in a ma&s;que, and transformed into Epi&s;copacy; then it can be thought po&s;&s;i|ble for all the Democracies and Ari&s;tocracies in the world to lie down and &s;leep, and to awake into monarchies, without op|po&s;ition or trace of hi&s;tory to record the marvellous change."</P>
<P>It was therefore not &s;o much from any nece&s;&s;ity, in my argu|ment with the Centinel (becau&s;e right or wrong, it was &s;uffi|cient that Epi&s;copacy was our mode) as to prevent &s;erious E|pi&s;copalians from being impo&s;ed upon by his bold and ground|le&s;s a&s;&s;ertion; that I have taken &s;ome pains to &s;hew that &s;uch an Epi&s;copate as is propo&s;ed for America, far from being a no|vel invention, is what almo&s;t all the reformed Churches have
<PB N="134" REF="011212_0072_0F862D7864FE98A8">given their te&s;timony for; declared it to be a truly ancient and even apo&s;tolical in&s;titution; and &s;uch as they would willingly have been &s;ubject to, if they had not been prevented by the &s;ituation of affairs, under different &s;tates, at the refor|mation.</P>
<P>On this footing, then, I leave this matter of Epi&s;copacy, and proceed to inquire whether we are ju&s;tly chargeable with any corruption, in having pre&s;erved &s;uch rites and ceremonies in our Church, as were judged by our wi&s;e reformers to be for decen|cy and good order, harmle&s;s in their own nature, and neither contradictory to the general u&s;age of prote&s;tants, nor to any po&s;itive law in &s;cripture?</P>
<P>The great principles upon which the Church of England was purged from the dro&s;s of popery, are fully &s;et forth in her articles, the prefaces to her liturgy, and by many of her able &s;ons; and they do honour to the &s;pirit and temper of our fir&s;t reformers.</P>
<P><Q>Tho&s;e men (&s;aith the learned Bi&s;hop Sander&s;on) are much mi&s;taken, who either mea&s;ure the prote&s;tant religion by an oppo&s;ition to popery; or account all popery, that is taught or practi&s;ed by the Church of Rome. It is only the corrup|tions and &s;uper&s;tition of that Church, whereunto the name of popery doth belong. Our godly forefathers had no purpo&s;e (nor had they any warrant) to &s;et up a new reli|gion, but to reform the old, by purging it from innovations, which, in tract of time (&s;ome &s;ooner, &s;ome later) had mingled with it and corrupted it, both in doctrine and wor&s;hip. Ac|cording to this purpo&s;e, they proceeded, without con&s;traint or precipitancy, freely and advi&s;edly, as in peaceable times; and brought their intentions to a happy end. All tho&s;e doc|trines which are either contrary to the written word of God, or &s;uperadded thereto as nece&s;&s;ary points of faith; all tho&s;e &s;uper&s;titions which are either unlawful, as contrary to God's word; or being not contrary, and therefore indifferent, are made e&s;&s;entials, and impo&s;ed as nece&s;&s;ary parts of wor&s;hip&mdash;the&s;e are things whereunto the name of popery doth properly belong;</Q> and were accordingly rejected by our Church at the reformation. <Q>As to ceremonies, the Church meant to make u&s;e of her liberty, and the lawful power &s;he had (and all Churches of Chri&s;t have, or ought to have) of ordering her eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs, yet to do it with &s;o much prudence and moderation, that the world might &s;ee, by what was laid a&s;ide, that &s;he acknowledged no &s;ubjecti|on to the &s;ee of Rome; and by what was retained, that &s;he did not recede from the Church of Rome out of any &s;pi|rit
<PB N="135" REF="011212_0072_0F862D7864FE98A8">of contradiction, but as nece&s;&s;itated for the maintenance of her ju&s;t liberty.</Q>&mdash;In &s;hort, <Q>as it is well expre&s;&s;ed by a humourous writer, in &s;tripping off the lace, &s;he was care|ful not to tear the garment.</Q></P>
<P>Concerning rites and ceremonies, we have the confe&s;&s;ion of all the reformed Churches, except perhaps our Centinel's Church, that they are not unlawful in them&s;elves, where they are decent and &s;ignificant.</P>
<P>The Helvetian Confe&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cap.</HI> 27.</NOTE> is&mdash;that "Churches have always u&s;ed their liberty in rites, as being things indifferent; which we do at this day."</P>
<P>The Bohemian is&mdash;"that ceremonies brought in, by a good cu&s;tom, are with an uniform con&s;ent to be retained in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical a&s;&s;emblies of Chri&s;tian people, in the common &s;er|vice of God."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cap.</HI> 15.</NOTE></P>

<P>Such are the conce&s;&s;ions, and &s;uch the practice of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable reformed Churches abroad, with re&s;pect to ceremo|nies in general&mdash;which are probably accounted among tho&s;e "human inventions" wherewith our Church is accu&s;ed by the Centinel of having "corrupted the pure word of God." If he will mention any particulars that are exceptionable in our Church, which are not retained in other prote&s;tant Churches, we &s;hall &s;hew that we are either able to defend them, or wil|ling to give them up. And till he does this, our an&s;wer can only be general. Let us now hear the &s;entiments of &s;ome of the able&s;t foreign divines on the &s;ame &s;ubject. Calvin, as u&s;u|al, I choo&s;e to lead the van; who has a long and excellent

<P>"All churches, &s;ays he, have power to make laws and or|dinances for e&s;tabli&s;hing a common polity among them&s;elves&mdash;but no polity can be upheld but by certain laws, nor any Rites ob&s;erved, without a &s;tated Form. Therefore, we are &s;o far from condemning the laws which conduce to this end, that we &s;ay, to take them away, is to cut the &s;inews of the church, and render it both weak and deformed.&mdash;The end of decency is, partly that, by appointing &s;uch Rites as will create a reverence for holy things, we may by &s;uch helps, be excited to devotion, and partly that our mode&s;ty and gra|vity, which are commendable in all our actions, may there more e&s;pecially appear."</P>
<P>Nor does he con&s;ider Church laws, about decent Rites and Ceremonies, as mere human inventions.&mdash;For "&s;uch laws &s;ays he, are founded on the authority of Scripture, and &s;o are both human and divine: which he illu&s;trates by the Geneva law, for kneeling at public prayer, as follows,&mdash;"If it be a&s;ked, continues he, whether this be an human tradition, which any man may refu&s;e or neglect at plea&s;ure? I an&s;wer, it is &s;o human, as al&s;o to be divine. It is of God, as it is part of that decency commended by the Apo&s;tle (1 Cor. xiv. 40.) But it is of men, as it particularly &s;pecifies, what the Scripture on|ly declared in general.&mdash;By this one example we may make an e&s;timate of all things of this kind. In outward di&s;cipline and ceremonies, Chri&s;t did not particularly pre&s;cribe what we &s;hould do; becau&s;e he fore&s;aw that would depend upon the different condition of times; and he did not judge one form agreeable to all ages.&mdash;"And el&s;ewhere,<NOTE PLACE="foot">&Dagger;&Dagger; <HI>De Reform. Eccle&s;. C.</HI> 16.</NOTE> he &s;ays, I do not contend about Ceremonies, that &s;erve only for Decency and Order; nor yet again&s;t &s;uch as are &s;ymbols of, or incitements to, that reverence we owe to God."&mdash;Now that &s;uch is the intention of our church ceremonies, &s;he expre&s;sly declares; and that they are not meant to bind con&s;cience, but for decen|cy and order.</P>
<P>But to proceed with Calvin, neither he nor his followers had any more objection to forms of prayer than to decent rites, &amp;c. In his letter to the Protector of England, he &s;ays, As to what concerns a form of prayer and eccle&s;ia&s;tical rites, I highly ap|prove of it; that there be a certain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">m, from which mini|&s;ters be not allowed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ary."&mdash;So the canon<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Book of Di&s;cip. C. 5.</NOTE> of the
<PB N="137" REF="011212_0073_0F862D79B8E78140">French Church expre&s;sly determined; and Calvin not only de|clared his own opinion in the&s;e things, but pre&s;&s;ed &s;trongly up|on others to have all di&s;putes done away concerning them&mdash;"I hope &s;ays he, to the fiery John Knox, your rigour about ce|remonies, which is di&s;plea&s;ing to many, will keep it&s;elf within due bounds of moderation."&mdash;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Epi&s;t. ad Joh.

We are free from all men; yet let us be the &s;ervants of peace and concord."</P>
<P>Happy had it been, if the Centinel and his party could have followed this advice; and as they are, or may be free from any thing that they may think corrupted, or of human invention in our Church, that they would enjoy the liberty which God hath given, and &s;uffer us to do the &s;ame!</P>
<P>To the&s;e te&s;timonies of Calvin, and of whole Churches, concerning the power which every Chri&s;tian &s;ociety has with|in it&s;elf to decree rites and ceremonies, which be not repugnant to Scripture, but for decency and order; I could add many in favour of the particular rites and ceremonies of the Engli&s;h church.&mdash;</P>

<P>AS the Centinel, in his gro&s;s charge again&s;t our Church, of having "corrupted the pure word of God with hu|man inventions," did neither think proper to mention what tho&s;e <HI>inventions</HI> are, nor in what points they are to be found, viz.&mdash;whether in <HI>government,</HI> in <HI>rites and ceremonies,</HI> or in <HI>doc|trines;</HI> I thought it nece&s;&s;ary, in order to be &s;ure of his mean|ing, to &s;uppo&s;e the whole <HI>three;</HI> and, in each of them, to make one <HI>appeal,</HI> as well to the judgment of reformed Churches abroad, as of &s;uch particular divines both at home and abroad, as might probably have the mo&s;t weight with the Centinel and his party.</P>
<P>What relates to the two fir&s;t points, (viz. epi&s;copal govern|ment, rites and ceremonies) being already di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, little need be &s;aid on the la&s;t point, viz. the <HI>doctrines</HI> of our Church. The&s;e, as contained in our articles, have long had the te&s;timony of the whole prote&s;tant world, in favour of their <HI>purity</HI> and <HI>or|thodoxy;</HI> and unle&s;s the Centinel &s;hould declare &s;o, in particu|lar and expre&s;s terms, I can hardly imagine that he meant to run &s;o contrary to the &s;entiments of his own party (even &s;ome of the mo&s;t rigid of them at home) as to charge any corruption upon the <HI>doctrinal parts</HI> of our <HI>articles,</HI> or <HI>Church &s;ervice.</HI> However, as his meaning is &s;o vague and undetermined, it may not be improper to add a few te&s;timonies on this head, as I have done on the former; although the &s;ubject be &s;omewhat antici|pated, in the te&s;timonies already given; where the writers had not &s;eparated one part from the other, but had &s;poken of go|vernment, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tes, ceremonies and doctrines together.</P>

<P>But further, as the Church of England has been the prin|cipal &s;upport of the reformation, down to the pre&s;ent time; &s;o it is &s;he, that hath born the chief burden and brunt of the day, from the beginning.

<P>"But the&s;e tricks have (as the bird of the night, at the ri|&s;ing of the &s;un) vani&s;hed at the appearance of the go&s;pel.&mdash;It was the will and plea&s;ure of almighty God, that, in &s;pite of all its enemies, the Go&s;pel of Je&s;us &s;hould at this time be &s;pread over the face of the whole earth; and men, obeying the commands of God, have, of their own accord, betaken them|&s;elves to the doctrine of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. We, in good truth, expected neither riches, plea&s;ure, nor ea&s;e from this &s;eparation; for all tho&s;e our enemies abound with; and we enjoyed a much great|er &s;hare of them when we agreed with them. Neither do we &s;hun <HI>peace</HI> and <HI>concord;</HI> but we will not fight again&s;t God, to be at peace with men."&mdash;</P></NOTE> by which a judgment may be made of the principles of our Church, and what a bulwark of the reformation &s;he is to be e&s;teemed.</P>
<P>And is there then, no regard, no charity due among fellow prote&s;tants to a Church that has borne &s;uch a part in vindi|cating our glorious common cau&s;e, and &s;etting at nought the
<PB N="145" REF="011212_0077_0F862D7DD18AFF50">a&s;&s;aults of our common enemy? Is &s;he &s;till to be called <HI>Corrupt, Super&s;titious,</HI> nay <HI>po&s;&s;ibly</HI> affected, after &s;o many well fought bat|tles again&s;t the CORRUPTIONS and SUPERSTITIONS of Chri|&s;tendom? Or will not <HI>reformation</HI> plea&s;e, till we have (contra|ry to our judgment and rea&s;on) <HI>reformed</HI> into a <HI>&s;keleton,</HI> and promi&s;cuou&s;ly thrown away the <HI>good</HI> with the <HI>bad,</HI> even things

<P>Having thus, I hope, with due temper, an&s;wered the Centi|nel on the principal heads propo&s;ed; I &s;hall conclude the&s;e pa|pers in <HI>Three</HI> more numbers, unle&s;s fre&s;h provocation be given.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SO abhorent to my nature is every &s;pecies of recrimination, however ju&s;tly provoked, that it is with &s;ome reluctance I enter upon the remainder of the ta&s;k I propo&s;ed for my&s;elf. The very <HI>cur</HI> that &s;narls at me, I am loth to treat with oppro|brious names, and would rather quiet him by throwing a cru&s;t, than attempting to break his bones.</P>
<P>Though you and your friends have called my <HI>knife</HI> a bloody one, and have &s;ometimes in imagination magnified it into a <HI>cleaver;</HI> yet let the public judge between you and me, whether I have not gone about my work with a decent and merciful hand, neither mangling the fle&s;h, nor disjointing the bones; but carefully &s;eparating the one from the other, I have fully &s;hewn that the fears and jealou&s;ies you have endeavoured to &s;pread among his Maje&s;ty's good &s;ubjects in America, concern|ing eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts, the lo&s;s of &s;piritual liberty, and enor|mous
<PB N="147" REF="011212_0078_0F862D7F22EFE4B8">epi&s;copal juri&s;dictions to be erected over the <HI>laity,</HI> are ab&s;olute chimeras of your own brain, without the lea&s;t &s;hadow of ground, in any law (<HI>&s;tatute</HI> or <HI>common</HI>) that hath force in the&s;e colonies. I have &s;hown further that your un-chri&s;tian and un-brotherly charge again&s;t our Church, of having <HI>corrupted the pure word of God with human inventions,</HI> &s;tands refuted by the te&s;timonies of almo&s;t every <HI>reformed</HI> Church upon earth; even by the founders and princes of your own party.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I have left the reader to judge, whether in your behaviour towards your epi&s;copal brethren, you could have been actuated by any better motive than an <HI>unhallowed zeal</HI> to exalt your own party on the depre&s;&s;ion of others; and whether it be fair or candid to keep up an eternal clamour, in order to deprive your fellow-prote&s;tants of a ju&s;t and natural right, merely on account of groundle&s;s jealou&s;ies, about contin|gencies ab&s;olutely <HI>improbable,</HI> and only <HI>po&s;&s;ible</HI> upon a &s;uppo&s;i|tion that all our laws and charters are to be di&s;&s;olved. I have appealed to your own con&s;cience, whether <HI>union</HI> among our|&s;elves in America, or the common cau&s;e of <HI>prote&s;tanti&s;m,</HI> are likely to be promoted by vilifying and traducing a Church which, I will &s;till &s;ay, is the main bulwark of the reformation; who&s;e venerable martyrs &s;ealed it with their blood; and who&s;e illu&s;trious divines, &s;till foremo&s;t in the battle, have &s;hook the <HI>papacy</HI> to its lowe&s;t foundation, and have exhibitted to the world &s;uch noble writings in favour of primitive Chri&s;tianity, as we believe, will only peri&s;h, or cea&s;e to be admired, when the world it&s;elf &s;hall peri&s;h with them!</P>
<P>So far, I think Sir, I ought not even to incur your blame in having proceeded; and although I was not forward to enter into this di&s;pute, yet rejoiced I am in the event, that it hath furni&s;hed an an&s;wer, and given &s;atisfaction, to &s;ome thou&s;ands, whom your party, in every corner of the country, were endea|vouring to prejudice in their &s;entiments concerning our Church. But, although I have thus far touched you but lightly, yet in what remains I mu&s;t approach towards your very <HI>vitals;</HI> and therefore I am unwilling to proceed without giving you a &s;hort <HI>re&s;pite,</HI> to &s;ee if you have any thing further to offer for your|&s;elf, and whether I may not be &s;aved from &s;ome part of the di&s;agreeable ta&s;k that lies before me. In the mean while, I will fairly tell you my <HI>three</HI> remaining &s;ubjects, which will be more or le&s;s enlarged upon, according as you offer fre&s;h matter; for I am earne&s;tly de&s;irous, on account of the public, that this controver&s;y, if it mu&s;t be further pro&s;ecuted, &s;hould be brought to as &s;peedy an i&s;&s;ue as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P N="1">1. You and your friends, allying your&s;elves with the <HI>North-Briton,</HI>
<PB N="148" REF="011212_0079_0F862D7F61C8F8B8">have a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly circulated his number LXI. with this favourite doctrine to exalt your party&mdash;"No DISSENTER, NO LIBERTY."&mdash;I propo&s;e therefore to give &s;ome &s;peci|mens of the zeal &s;hewn by your party for <HI>liberty</HI> from the beginning.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Remon&s;trant,</HI> one of your auxiliaries, if peradven|ture not your&s;elf, hath told us how many have &s;uffered under the penal laws of our Church, and threatens us with hanging the&s;e laws out to view. Ju&s;t as if one were to throw a parcel of dead men's bodies before our eyes, and accu&s;e a certain per|&s;on as the murderer, threatning, if he would not confe&s;s the fact, to produce the weapon wherewith it was perpetrated. We would be glad this weapon was produced, as we think it an alle|viating circum&s;tance that it would be found a <HI>defen&s;ive,</HI> not an <HI>offen&s;ive</HI> one. Upon this head therefore, I propo&s;e to &s;hew what have been the doctrines of your party concerning that <HI>toloration</HI> whereof you boa&s;t your&s;elves to be examples; and &s;hall make good what Bi&s;hop BRAMHAL long &s;ince &s;aid to your fore-runner <HI>Baxter.</HI>&mdash;"Sum up all of your party that &s;ince the be|ginning of the Reformation have been <HI>ca&s;t a&s;ide,</HI> or <HI>driven away</HI> in the whole kingdom; and we will &s;et in the balance only tho&s;e who, in the &s;hort &s;pace of &s;even years, in three places, London and the two Univer&s;ities, were haled to pri&s;ons, cha&s;ed into Bani&s;hments, &s;eque&s;tered, or left to the mercile&s;s world to beg their bread, and they &s;hall double your number;&mdash; and for learning, &amp;c. tho&s;e of your party will &s;carce de&s;erve to be named with them in the &s;ame day; and if we compare the &s;ufferings of your &s;uppo&s;ed confe&s;&s;ors, they will appear but <HI>flea|bitings,</HI> in compari&s;on of theirs. But the greate&s;t di&s;parity re|maineth yet untouched.&mdash;the one &s;uffered for FAITH and LOYALTY, &amp;c.&mdash;the others for FACTION.</P>
<P N="3">3. As to my concluding paper, this I propo&s;e for the &s;ubject. You have mo&s;t unju&s;tly accu&s;ed a &s;ociety, con&s;i&s;ting of many of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable names in Great-Britain "of having &s;quandered away money collected for the relief of the &s;avages." I will therefore enquire what u&s;e your party has made of large &s;ums collected for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. Further, you are again in your 21&s;t. number labouring to prove Doctor <HI>Chandler</HI> the aggre&s;&s;or in this di&s;pute; although if he had begun it, there is a manife&s;t difference between a pamphlet, read probably by a hundred people, and introducing the matter, as you did, into a news-paper, to be read perhaps by thirty thou&s;and. But to cut this matter &s;hort, I am able to lay before the world &s;ome letters written by the leaders of your party, in November 1766 (long before Dr. Chandler wrote his piece) wherein this at|tack
<PB N="149" REF="011212_0079_0F862D7F61C8F8B8">upon the Church in America, (pur&s;uant to letters from England) was projected; and a confe&s;&s;ion made that your par|ty were <Q>determined in a few months to be at as great vari|ance with <HI>Churchmen</HI> on account of their de&s;ire of Bi&s;hops, as ever you were with the <HI>Quakers;</HI> and that, for this pur|po&s;e, <HI>&s;alutary &s;teps</HI> were then taking to get the WHOLE PRES|BYTERIAN INTEREST on the <HI>Continent,</HI> more firmly united.</Q> I can even oblige you with your plan of union, corre&s;pondence, committees, &amp;c. and even the names of &s;ome committees, If I had not too good an opinion of &s;everal who&s;e names you have made free with, to believe they were ever con&s;ulted or con&s;ent|ing in &s;uch a &s;cheme. To this, if I had not a de&s;ire to clo&s;e rather than widen differences, could be added, a &s;ample of &s;ome exhortations, circulated not a year ago <Q>to &s;cour rifles, thra&s;h grain, make double diligence in their <HI>&s;tills,</HI> and to fly in the face of government;</Q> which it would make one &s;hudder to read. From all which I mu&s;t conclude with an argument in your way, and &s;hew that if we are to regard pre&s;ent appearances, or form any judgment of the future, from what is pa&s;t, it is at the am|bitious &s;pirit and growing power of your party, and not at the government of our Church by a Bi&s;hop, that all America ought ju&s;tly to be alarmed.</P>
<P>But, in truth, from the gloomy pro&s;pect that &s;eems gather|ing again&s;t us on the other &s;ide of the <HI>Atlantic;</HI> it might be better for you, and for me, to cultivate <HI>dome&s;tic harmony</HI> for the pre&s;ent, and &s;u&s;pend the &s;ettlement of our remaining differences to a more convenient &s;ea&s;on; all which will depend intirely on your&s;elf and your party.</P>

<HEAD>A LETTER TO A FRIEND.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THO' I verily believe the Church of England to be both in Form and Doctrine, the mo&s;t pure and acceptable to God, of any religious Society now exi&s;ting upon the Face of the Earth, and con&s;equently it mu&s;t be my earne&s;t Wi&s;h and De&s;ire that this Church which I &s;o highly e&s;teem and reverence, may &s;pread and prevail uni|ver&s;ally; yet the long continued reiterated Clamours of the <HI>American Whig,</HI> the <HI>Centinel</HI> and other Writers again&s;t the Ad|mi&s;&s;ion of Bi&s;hops to re&s;ide in the Briti&s;h Colonies, as if there|by both our religious and civil Liberties would be not only en|dangered but ab&s;olutely lo&s;t, could not fail to awaken in me &s;ome unea&s;y Apprehen&s;ions of the Con&s;equences that might at|tend the e&s;tabli&s;hment of tho&s;e reverend Prelates among us. The Writers again&s;t them had made u&s;e of every Art and Argument, to repre&s;ent the&s;e Con&s;equences in the mo&s;t dread|ful Light, and I could not help being a little alarmed; for tho' their Arguments were very far from convincing, yet they puz|zled me: I &s;uppo&s;ed them to be wrong, but was not without &s;ome Anxiety at the Thought that they might po&s;&s;ibly be right. I would have &s;et my&s;elf down to examine their Arguments cri|tically for my&s;elf, but my Situation would not admit of it, and my Opinion remained vibrating in Su&s;pen&s;e, till I fortunately met with the foregoing Pages of the Anatomi&s;t, which have placed all the material Points in a clear Light, and removed all
<PB N="151" REF="011212_0080_0F862D8256CD6ED0">the Difficulties that perplexed me: And as you &s;eem to be in much the &s;ame Predicament that I was, I &s;end you the &s;ame Medicine that relieved me, for which I doubt not, you will be, as I was, &s;incerely thankful to the judicious Author.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve one of the points which both the <HI>Whig</HI> and the <HI>Centinel,</HI> very much labour to prove, is, that no particular Church, or religious Society, more than others, ought to ob|tain a civil e&s;tabli&s;hment in any Government&mdash;By the Way, I believe there is no religious Sect in the Briti&s;h Dominions, but what have avail'd them&s;elves of a Civil E&s;tabli&s;hment, when e|ver they have had Opportunity, as much as the Church&mdash;for In&s;tance&mdash;The religious Forms and Principles in the New-England Governments, are &s;o interwoven with the Admini&s;tra|tion of Civil Government, that a Man &s;tands very little Chance of being prefer'd to Offices of Honour and Importance&mdash;un|le&s;s his religious Profe&s;&s;ion and Conduct corre&s;ponds with the general E&s;tabli&s;hment of tho&s;e Colonies&mdash;there are indeed &s;ome Exceptions to this general Ob&s;ervation, but In&s;tances are rare: And I believe it is an indi&s;putable Fact, that this Aid and Support of the civil Power, with the Hopes and Expectations, it gives ri&s;e to, are the principal Means of continuing the Modes and Doctrines that have long prevail'd in tho&s;e Governments. &mdash;But to return.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the &s;pecious Arguments of the <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Centinel,</HI> it &s;eem'd to me an Ab&s;urdity, that a Church con|fe&s;&s;edly form'd and in&s;tituted by Chri&s;t him&s;elf (for that the Argument &s;uppo&s;es) &s;hould be prohibitted from receiving the Aid and Countenance of the Civil Power, or at lea&s;t any Prefer|ence to other religious Societies.&mdash;This Argument I take to be indefen&s;ible, unle&s;s upon the Suppo&s;ition that there can be no &s;tronger Evidence in favour of Truth than of Fal&s;hood. Add to this, that the <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Centinel</HI> in their Manner of arguing, manife&s;ted a Di&s;po&s;ition very un&s;uitable to the Spirit of that Religion they pretended to be &s;o zealous to promote, and laid them under &s;trong Su&s;picions, of acting upon fal&s;e Principles, with unworthy De&s;igns. In&s;tead of &s;tating Facts in a clear Light, and arguing upon them in a candid rea&s;onable Manner, their Aim appears to have been to mi&s;repre&s;ent, and place every matter of Di&s;pute in the mo&s;t ob&s;cure and unfavourable Point of View,&mdash;To perplex an Argument, and evade the Point in Di&s;|pute; to put the wor&s;t and mo&s;t perver&s;e Con&s;truction upon e|very Expre&s;&s;ion, and to u&s;e a Style and Language full of Haugh|tine&s;s, In&s;olence and Provocation, calculated not to convince and reconcile, but to irritate and inflame, to widen and perpetuate Differences from one Generation to another. The&s;e Ob&s;ervati|ons
<PB N="152" REF="011212_0081_0F862D8262E50F48">upon the Writings of the <HI>Whig, Centinel,</HI> &amp;c. being &s;uch as could not fail to &s;trike a Reader of the lea&s;t Attention, gave me a &s;hrewd Su&s;picion that every Thing they had advanced a|gain&s;t Bi&s;hops and the Church, was founded on Deceit and Malice, intended to do Mi&s;chief, to root out and de&s;troy, or hinder the Growth of the Church in America, by pre|venting its Enjoyment of an undoubted Right e&s;&s;ential to its Support and Continuance. But the&s;e were rather Matters of Suppo&s;ition than ab&s;olute Certainty to me, till I had the Plea|&s;ure to find the Subject fully inve&s;tigated by the <HI>Anatomi&s;t,</HI> who has removed my Doubts, and given me entire Satis|faction.</P>
<P>The American Profe&s;&s;ors of the Religion of the Church e&s;tabli&s;h|ed in England, the mo&s;t pure and re&s;pectable Church upon Earth, have an undoubted Right, at lea&s;t, in common with other religious Societies, to occupy and po&s;&s;e&s;s within them&s;elves all the Powers and Offices nece&s;&s;ary to the Completion and Con|tinuance of their own Body as a Church. But tho&s;e Rights, the <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Centinel,</HI> and their Party have thought proper to withhold from them, under Pretence, that they might po&s;&s;ibly u&s;e them to the Oppre&s;&s;ion of other religious Denominations; and &s;o the&s;e good Gentlemen would actually do a certain Inju|ry to the Church, on an Imagination that the Church might po&s;&s;ibly hereafter do the &s;ame Injury to them! I wonder how they would like to have this Doctrine practi&s;ed upon them|&s;elves?</P>
<P>I am at a Lo&s;s to determine whether the Clamours and Di&s;putes of the&s;e Gentlemen upon this Head are mo&s;t remarkable, as being ridiculous or malevolent.</P>
<P>This however I am &s;ure of, that if their writings &s;hould at|tract any con&s;iderable Notice in England, and &s;hould be &s;up|po&s;ed to be agreeable to the general Sentiments of the Colonies (as the Writers them&s;elves, all along, with great Inju&s;tice, endeavour to make the World believe) or even of a con&s;ide|rable Number in them, &s;uch a Belief in England, would rai&s;e the mo&s;t fatal Prejudice again&s;t the Colonies, and be the Occa|&s;ion of inconceivable Mi&s;chiefs: We &s;hould be all con&s;idered as a factious, turbulent, unrea&s;onable People, implacable Ene|mies to the Church; and con&s;equently all the Friends to the Church, who are the mo&s;t powerful Body of the Nation, would be again&s;t us; but I hope, thro' the Interpo&s;ition of divine Providence, the Evil may be averted, or fall only on tho&s;e who devi&s;ed it.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>Remainder of a brief View of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Juri&s;diction, as it is at this Day practi&s;ed in</HI> England: <HI>Begun in</HI> No. XXVI. Vol. I. page 422.</HEAD>
<P>I Have now by me a mo&s;t moving and lamentable account (contained in above &s;ixty letters) &s;ent me by Mr. <HI>John Tem|pe&s;t of Old Durham,</HI> (formerly a member of your hou&s;e) com|plaining of the mo&s;t barbarous and tyrannic proceedings of the &s;piritual and temporal courts there, again&s;t his per&s;on, e&s;tate, and property, that ever was known to have been practi&s;ed in any court of law or ju&s;tice whatever. And this (as he &s;ays) chiefly promoted and carried on by a confederacy between the bi&s;hop's chancellor and &s;heriff, who, by their under-officers and agents, have illegally &s;eized upon whatever of his property they can lay their hands on, on pretence of an outlawry or ex|communication, of which he had no notice till the &s;eizure actu|ally made.&mdash;And that, upon application to his &s;overeign, the bi&s;hop, for redre&s;s, he has been denied all manner of relief; and therefore intreats me to repre&s;ent his ca&s;e to you, the parliament's committee, which I am now preparing to that end.</P>
<P>But before I trouble you with that particular ca&s;e, I beg leave to add a few other general ob&s;ervations, touching the ar|tifices and practices of bi&s;hops, &amp;c. in driving on their eccle&s;ia&s;|tical trade of getting money. Which artifices and practices, I &s;hall endeavour to range under the&s;e ten general heads, (ex|clu&s;ive of &s;ome excentricities) viz.</P>
<P N="1">1. By their fees for ordaining prie&s;ts and deacons, which ge|neral ordinations being at four times in the year, may well be computed at about 100<ABBR>l.</ABBR> each time. And thus the whole 26 bi&s;hops and archbi&s;hops, may make in the whole about 10,400<ABBR>l.</ABBR> per annum.</P>
<P N="2">2. By in&s;titutions and inductions to vacant benefices, for eve|ry
<PB N="154" REF="011212_0082_0F862D8331E1CE50">one of which they have at lea&s;t three pounds. And there being computed in England 9285 pari&s;hes, this, at the ordina|ry rate of one in a pari&s;h, comes to 27,855<ABBR>l.</ABBR></P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> Some pari&s;hes con&s;i&s;t of divers benefices, and others, have divers chapelries, which are of the &s;ame nature, and re|quire in&s;titution and induction as well as other benefices.&mdash; The &s;ingle pari&s;h of Halifax in York&s;hire, has ten or twelve &s;uch chapelries. Nor are the in&s;titutions to archdeaconries, deanries, prebendaries, &s;inecures, &amp;c. here included; &s;o that this head of in&s;titutions and inductions, is of much greater be|nefit to bi&s;hops than is generally e&s;timated.</P>
<P N="3">3. For making rural deans, and for taking their oaths, &amp;c. The bi&s;hops u&s;ually received of every rural dean &s;o &s;worn, the yearly &s;um of 8<ABBR>s.</ABBR> 6<ABBR>d.</ABBR> as I am informed. And this may hint to us the rea&s;on why the late Queen Anne, no doubt on the ad|vice or importunity of &s;ome bi&s;hops, &s;ent her letter, dated 29 Jan. 1710, to the then convocation, for augmenting the num|ber of rural deans, &amp;c. See <HI>Nel&s;on's rights of the clergy,</HI> 252.</P>
<P N="4">4. By granting vi&s;itation licences to beneficed mini&s;ters to preach in their own cures; for although they are ordained, in|&s;tituted, and inducted before, and by the canons are &s;trictly en|joined to preach the go&s;pel; yet this mu&s;t not be done, till &s;uch a vi&s;itation licence, or the bi&s;hop's approbation, be obtain|ed: Which licence, on every epi&s;copal vi&s;itation, co&s;ts every &s;uch beneficed mini&s;ter 10<ABBR>s.</ABBR> And this for the &s;aid 9285 pari&s;hes, or rather above 10,000 benefices in England, comes to 5000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> per annum.</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> when the bi&s;hop does not vi&s;it, the archdeacon does, and that twice yearly; &s;o that there never fails a vi&s;itation, in order to pick up the pence. <HI>Vide Po&s;t.</HI> Archdeacon's juri&s;|diction.</P>
<P N="5">5. By granting &s;everal other &s;pecial kinds of licences, where|of nine or ten are &s;ufficiently remarkable, viz.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Licences to unbeneficed curates and deacons to preach, &amp;c.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Licences to &s;choolma&s;ters and &s;choolmi&s;tre&s;&s;es to teach, &amp;c.</ITEM>

<ITEM>6. Licences to phy&s;icians to practi&s;e phy&s;ic.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. Licences to midwives to practi&s;e their profe&s;&s;ion, and to baptize.</ITEM>

</LIST>
<P>And I believe, on enquiry, &s;ome other kinds of bi&s;hop's licences may be di&s;covered, as perhaps licences to <HI>communicate with</HI> the church of Rome; for I have heard &s;ome di&s;cour&s;es of that kind.</P>
<P>But to proceed,</P>
<P N="6">6. The bi&s;hops al&s;o receive very con&s;iderable profits or per|qui&s;ites by con&s;ecrating of churches and churchyards; for tho' nothing be due of right, yet 'tis well known what is volunta|rily given into the hands of a bi&s;hop's &s;ervant for his ma&s;ter's u&s;e, can be no &s;imony or corruption in the bi&s;hop. This may be learned from the example of a pre&s;ent right reverend and ever memorable prelate.</P>
<P N="7">7. By granting ab&s;olutions and commutations for penances, wherein there is generally a regard had to the ability of the &s;inner.&mdash;For if he be rich, a good round &s;um is expected to free him from that chain of the Devil, called excommunicati|on; but if the wretch be poor, he is delivered to the Devil of cour&s;e; and though he performs his penance both in body and &s;oul, yet neither can be delivered either from Hell or the eccle&s;i|a&s;tical court, 'till he has paid his fees.</P>
<P N="8">8. They al&s;o receive va&s;t &s;ums of money by granting pro|bates of wills, and letters of admini&s;tration.&mdash;And by an u&s;urped right (for &s;o, in fact, this juri&s;diction is) they are be|come in a great mea&s;ure the di&s;po&s;ers and di&s;pen&s;ers of dead men's will's; and though now therein providentially re&s;trained in &s;ome things, by the act of di&s;tributions, yet &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of too much power to be for the &s;ubject's benefit.</P>
<P N="9">9. By framing new oaths and articles again&s;t their vi&s;itati|ons, and compelling church-wardens to &s;wear to pre&s;ent accord|ing to &s;uch new invented articles; whereby divers pro&s;ecutions of innocent per&s;ons have been carried on in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts.</P>
<P>'Tis true, this practice is now almo&s;t <HI>ex u&s;u,</HI> but in&s;tead thereof we have almo&s;t yearly new &s;ets of pa&s;toral charges, which, how little benefit &s;oever they bring either to the flock or to the book&s;eller, yet have proved gainful to &s;ome of their Lord&s;hips.</P>
<P N="10">10. By procurations, &s;ynodals, and other vi&s;itatorial pay|ments and pen&s;ions: For in the bi&s;hop's vi&s;itation two things are ob&s;ervable:</P>
<P N="1">1. The churchwardens and chapel-wardens of every pari&s;h and chapelry within the dioce&s;e, are called over, and there re|ceive a book of articles to pre&s;ent by, for which they generally
<PB N="156" REF="011212_0083_0F862D83E5651308">pay 2<ABBR>s.</ABBR> or 2<ABBR>s.</ABBR> 6<ABBR>d.</ABBR> and if any of them are ab&s;ent, they are there cited or &s;ummoned by proclamation, to appear in the bi|&s;hop's next con&s;i&s;torial cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with co&s;ts.</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> The&s;e church-wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ens and chapel-wardens do pay at every bi&s;hop's vi&s;itation for &s;uch a book of articles, though the very &s;ame they had before. They al&s;o pay the bi&s;hop's clerk for writing their pre&s;entments, (though many of them do it them&s;elves) 2<ABBR>s.</ABBR> 6<ABBR>d.</ABBR> which, in 9285 pari&s;hes, comes to 1058<ABBR>l.</ABBR> to which add for the book of articles, and it doubles the &s;um.</P>
<P N="2">2. All the mini&s;ters within the dioce&s;e are obliged to attend the bi&s;hop's vi&s;itation, where they are to pay about 1. 8<ABBR>d.</ABBR> or more, merely for producing to the bi&s;hop's regi&s;ter their li|cences to preach, though &s;uch licences have been &s;o produced and allowed never &s;o often before&mdash;After which, they pay to the bi&s;hop, or to his u&s;e, the u&s;ual &s;um for procuration and &s;ynodals; as al&s;o 8<ABBR>d.</ABBR> claimed by the gentleman apparitor, to whom mo&s;t pays 1<ABBR>s.</ABBR> This payment &s;eems to be in favour of the bi&s;hop's man, in order to obtain that of the ma&s;ter. There is al&s;o a &s;uit and &s;ervice expected at this court from all, even the poore&s;t unbeneficed curate or clerk within the dioce&s;e.&mdash; But I &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e are &s;pared in point of money, out of cha|rity, or&mdash;.</P>
<P>One thing more is ob&s;ervable with re&s;pect to the province of York, viz. That when any archbi&s;hop is fir&s;t in&s;talled or en|throned at York, all the per&s;ons and vicars within his juri&s;dic|tion, though never &s;o poor, and their family-charge never &s;o great, are obliged to give him the tenth of their eccle&s;ia&s;tical livings, as a benevolence, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t the poor archbi&s;hop to &s;ettle him&s;elf in that &s;ee; which they &s;ay u&s;ually amounts to &s;even or eight thou&s;and pounds (a &s;weet mor&s;el of eccle&s;ia&s;tical food!) And 'tis &s;aid, that if any, even the meane&s;t vicar, who&s;e children want bread, does thro' poverty omit this cu&s;to|mary payment, he mu&s;t certainly expect to be &s;everely whip|ped for the offence, in their mercile&s;s &s;piritual court, 'till they have flayed him to the very bones.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides which, in &s;ome dioce&s;es, as London, &amp;c. there is a duty paid, called the bi&s;hop's pen&s;ion, i. e. 10<ABBR>l.</ABBR> for every archdeaconry, and proportionably for other dignities and pecu|liar juri&s;dictions, as may be &s;een in <HI>Newcourt's Repertorium Canonicum,</HI> vol. I. and II.</P>
<P>Next to epi&s;copal juri&s;diction is to be con&s;idered that of the archdeacons, who&s;e number I have before limitted to &s;ixty, but find on a farther &s;crutiny they may be enlarged to &s;eventy, or
<PB N="157" REF="011212_0083_0F862D83E5651308">more; for the dioce&s;e of London alone has five, and other dio|ce&s;es proportionable.</P>
<P>The&s;e archdeacons have their vi&s;itations twice yearly, viz. at Michaelmas and Ea&s;ter, both which afford them plentiful har|ve&s;ts, in their collections of procurations, &s;ynodals, and other profitable perqui&s;ities. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. At their Ea&s;ter vi&s;itations, the mini&s;ters within their re|&s;pective di&s;tricts pay them &s;ynodals, which they denominate their pa&s;chal rents, taking of each per&s;on &s;ix or &s;even &s;hillings, &s;ome more, &s;ome le&s;s; for the&s;e payments are not all alike, but, I &s;uppo&s;e, rai&s;ed or le&s;&s;ened according to the value of the bene|fice; but none mu&s;t come empty-handed.</P>
<P N="2">2. At their Michaelmas vi&s;itations the &s;ame mini&s;ters pay their procurations, &s;ome &s;even or eight, &s;ome ten or twelve &s;hillings, &s;ome more, &s;ome le&s;s. But it is judged, that on a moderate computation, the archdeacons of England do yearly collect for procurations only, &s;ix or &s;even thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>The next juri&s;diction to be con&s;idered, is that of deans and their chapters.&mdash;But having already mentioned the &s;everal kinds of deans, and the manner of exerci&s;ing their juri&s;dictions, I &s;hall not at pre&s;ent plunge any farther into this bottomle&s;s barathron of eccle&s;ia&s;tical officers, and their rapines; but beg leave to conclude with the words of a late eminent prelate of the church of England, viz. Dr. <HI>G. Burnet,</HI> bi&s;hop of Sarum, who, in a familiar di&s;cour&s;e with me on this very &s;ubject, free|ly declared, <HI>That the canon law and eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction were originally derived from Hell; and that thither it ought to be &s;ent again:</HI> And ob&s;erving me to be &s;omewhat &s;tartled at his words, he continued thus; <HI>A greater than I, even an archbi&s;hop</HI> (naming <HI>Grindal</HI>) <HI>was al&s;o of this opinion:</HI> To which I only add,</P>
<P><HI>Heu! heu! haec &egrave; &s;ulphureo fonte Eccle&s;ia&s;ticorum exurgunt! Vide Mat. Paris,</HI> p. 542. Col. 2.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations, I humbly &s;ubmit to your ju&s;t and equita|ble enquiry; and am (with all due re&s;pect)</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your mo&s;t obedient Servant. <HI>W. BOHUN.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>

</EPIGRAPH>
<HEAD><HI>To</HI> TIMOTHY TICKLE, ESQ.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT the CHURCH labours under a real Hard&s;hip, with Re&s;pect to Ordination, is, I believe, &s;ufficiently evident. &mdash;That the <HI>Whig</HI> and his Confederates, would fain perpe|tuate that Hard&s;hip, I have demon&s;trated in a former Letter; and make no Doubt that it is clear by this Time to every can|did and unprejudiced Enquirer.</P>
<P>The Independants of <HI>America,</HI> tho&s;e worthy Imitators of the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> of old, like them, <Q>bind heavy Burthens, and grie|vous to be borne, and lay them on Men's Shoulders; but they them&s;elves will not move them with one of their Fin|gers.</Q>&mdash;Had <HI>they</HI> &s;uffered a Hard&s;hip of the &s;ame Nature, tho' infinitely le&s;s grievous than the one abovementioned, how would the Pre&s;s have groaned with their Complaints; &s;ince even in this Land of Liberty and Toleration, they rai&s;e &s;uch vio|lent Clamours, merely becau&s;e the <HI>National Church</HI> petitions for tho&s;e Peivileges that they already enjoy?</P>
<P>I am far, however, from blaming a ju&s;t Sen&s;ibility of the Grievances we <HI>may</HI> &s;uffer; but that very Sen&s;ibility ought to give us a Fellow-Feeling for others, and make us unfeignedly de&s;irous to relieve them.</P>
<P>If we examine the Conduct of the Champions in the pre&s;ent literary Conflict, who have entered the Li&s;ts as Opponents to the Introduction of a Bi&s;hop, we &s;hall find them not aware of this Con&s;equence, or at lea&s;t, not influenced by it.</P>
<P>The Hard&s;hip which the Church laboured under as to Ordi|nation, was evident and &s;triking&mdash;To invalidate the Ar|gument ari&s;ing from it, the <HI>Whig,</HI> with a Degree of Mode&s;ty
<PB N="162" REF="011212_0086_0F862D8621BAF2E0">and Candour unparallel'd in the Annals of <HI>Grub&s;treet,</HI> calls a Voyage of &s;everal Thou&s;and Miles amid&s;t the Wonders and Pe|rils of the Great Deep, by the diminutive Epithet of, <HI>a Trip for Ordination.</HI></P>
<P>"As to the Trip for Ordination (&s;ays he) it is far from an Inconvenience;" that is to &s;ay, a long and dangerous Voyage, at a great Expence, if it be called by the Name of <HI>"a Trip for Ordination,"</HI> changes its Nature, and becomes <HI>"far from an Inconvenience."</HI></P>
<P>Let any one addre&s;s a Per&s;on on the Rack who feels the mo&s;t excruciating Pain, and tell him, that the reducing his Limbs to a genteel Po&s;ition, is "far from an Inconvenience," and &s;ee whether his Angui&s;h will be thereby alleviated, or he convinced that his Sufferings &s;erve only to reduce his Limbs to a genteel Po&s;ition.</P>
<P>And yet, &s;uch is the Logick made U&s;e of by the <HI>American Whig,</HI> in his candid and judicious Lucubrations, whom I &s;hall leave to enjoy the Wit, (if peradventure there be any) of the elegant Pa&s;&s;age now ob&s;erved upon&mdash;unmole&s;ted and alone.</P>
<P>The Members of the CHURCH indeed, in one Sen&s;e, are rea|dy to allow "that this is far from an <HI>Inconvenience;</HI>" for they e&s;teem it an intolerable Hard&s;hip which &s;trikes at the very Be|ing of the Church in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>The Rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned why "the Trip for Ordination," is far from an Inconvenience, is, becau&s;e, in the <HI>Whig</HI>'s Opinion, <HI>"it doubtle&s;s conduces much to the reputable Figure of the Mi&s;&s;iona|ries."</HI>&mdash;And why then &s;hould not the Pre&s;byterian, Con|gregational or Independant Teachers, (call them what you will) take a &s;imilar Trip, &s;ince meek-eyed Charity it&s;elf, may di&s;|cern, that many of them might make a much more <HI>reputable Figure</HI> than they do at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Before I quit the <HI>American Whig,</HI> give me Leave to mention a Calumny he introduces, for no other Purpo&s;e, but to vilify the Church Clergy&mdash;I mean his In&s;inuation, that they preach borrowed Sermons, which fal&s;e and virulent as it is, yet, in ma|ny Circum&s;tances, ea&s;y to be imagined, might be ju&s;tified to the World, as well as their own Con&s;ciences.</P>
<P>We are told, Sir, in Mr. LIVINGSTON'S <HI>manly &s;pirited</HI> Let|ter to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Landaff,</HI> that <HI>"Recrimination is reputed to be ju&s;t:"</HI> And were I inclined to recriminate, I doubtle&s;s could do it with the greate&s;t Ju&s;tice.&mdash;I might repre&s;ent in &s;tri|king Colours, the non&s;en&s;ical Jargon and Cant, too often thun|dered out from the Pulpits of <HI>extempore</HI> Haranguers, to the great Di&s;gu&s;t of all &s;en&s;ible Men, and the prodigious Delight
<PB N="163" REF="011212_0086_0F862D8621BAF2E0">of tho&s;e who think every Thing they cannot comprehend, a Miracle of Wi&s;dom and Erudition&mdash;But I &s;pare the <HI>Whig</HI>'s Favourites, and leave unnoticed their "vain Repetitions," and all the <HI>Re&s;t and Re&s;idue</HI> of the bright Catalogue of <HI>new-fangled Ornaments,</HI> which compo&s;e their <HI>complete Sy&s;tem of reformed Pulpit Eloquence.</HI> However, as the <HI>Whig</HI> does not think "a Trip" acro&s;s the Atlantic, indi&s;pen&s;ably requi&s;ite <HI>for the Pur|cha&s;e of Second-hand Sermons</HI> to qualify a Church Clergyman for the Exerci&s;e of his Function; &s;o I believe nothing el&s;e want|ing to con&s;titute a right <HI>True Blue</HI> Independant Apo&s;tle, but a comfortable Stock of <HI>mode&s;t A&s;&s;urance.</HI>" Of which, "a more than <HI>brazen Monument</HI> is to be erected," by liberally dealing out twice or thrice each <HI>Sabbath Day,</HI> to a gaping Audience, their own crude and indige&s;ted Notions, as the Oracles of Truth, and the Dictates of Divine Wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>Such are the <HI>Whig</HI>'s Endeavours to &s;urmount the Argument for a Bi&s;hop, deduced from the Source contained in my former Letter&mdash;Let us now &s;ee whether any more effectual have been u&s;ed by that <HI>learned Veteran,</HI> Dr. CHAUNCEY.</P>
<P>In his ever memorable An&s;wer to Dr. CHANDLER's <HI>Appeal,</HI> he upon this Head, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">es Notice of four Particulars&mdash; The Danger of cro&s;&s;ing the Atlanric&mdash;The Expence of the Voyage&mdash;The Difficulty of &s;upplying the Church with Clergymen under the&s;e Di&s;couragements: And the Impo&s;&s;ibili|ty, that a Bi&s;hop re&s;iding in <HI>England,</HI> &s;hould be acquainted with the Characters of tho&s;e who go Home for Orders.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t, he ob&s;erves, <Q>that the going to <HI>England</HI> for Ordination, is rather an Advantage than a Di&s;advantage to the Church. That as to him&s;elf, he &s;hould e&s;teem it a hap|py Circum&s;tance in the Ca&s;e, where he inclined to take Orders. That many he had mentioned it to, had declared them&s;elves of the &s;ame Mind. And, <HI>were it proper,</HI> that he could name &s;ome Candidates for the Mini&s;try, who had been tempted <HI>by the Profe&s;&s;ors of the Church,</HI> to receive Epi&s;copal Ordination, with this Motive <HI>in &s;pecial,</HI> that they &s;hould have a fine Op|portunity to &s;ee <HI>England.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Without Doubt, we have as much Rea&s;on at lea&s;t to <HI>con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"></HI> in Doctor <HI>Chauncey's Veracity,</HI> as to admire the <HI>Whig</HI>'s i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|&s;ible <HI>Mode&s;ty;</HI> and therefore, I &s;hall not di&s;pute, that the Doc|tor would e&s;teem it "a happy Circum&s;tance" to cro&s;s the At|lantic, were he inclined to take Orders; or that many he had mentioned it to were &s;eriou&s;ly of the &s;ame Mind; or that &s;ome Candidates for the Mini&s;try had been tampered with to receive Epi&s;copal Ordination, with this <HI>&s;pecial</HI> Motive, "that they would have a fine Opportunity to &s;ee <HI>England.</HI>"&mdash;But
<PB N="164" REF="011212_0087_0F862D8C4332AE08">tho' the Doctor and his Friends, as well as the Candidates above mentioned, are Per&s;ons of &s;o much Re&s;olution, that they "e&s;teem it a happy Circum&s;tance," to face the Dangers of the Ocean, merely to gratify an idle Curio&s;ity; yet he &s;hould con|&s;ider, that there may be many worthy and learned Men of E|pi&s;copal Principles, and inclined to the Mini&s;try, but not ble&s;t with <HI>&s;o much I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">repidity,</HI> who look with Horror upon the "Raging of the Sea," and would infinitely rather enjoy Tran|quility in &s;ome other Profe&s;&s;ion, than &s;eek for Orders at the Hazard of their Lives.</P>
<P>It may indeed be imagined, as the Doctor never laid hold of <HI>&s;o happy a Circum&s;tance,</HI> when he was inclined to be ordained, which he might very well have done, &s;ince &s;uch Ordination as his Sect e&s;teem regular, may doubtle&s;s be procured in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> that therefore his pre&s;ent A&s;&s;ertion is <HI>devoid of Truth,</HI> and only made to &s;erve a particular Purpo&s;e. But as the Doc|tor's Veracity is not to be que&s;tioned, I rather think, that he him&s;elf has been deceived in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e; for we often, in|advertently, apply the &s;mall End of the Gla&s;s to view Dangers at a Di&s;tance, in which we conceive our&s;elves not to be in|tere&s;ted.</P>
<P>But before I di&s;mi&s;s this Point, permit me to reprimand the Doctor in the &s;tronge&s;t Manner, for calling the Profe&s;&s;ors of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as it were, <HI>propter Excellentiam, Pro|fe&s;&s;ors of the Church</HI>&mdash;A Fault for which he mu&s;t have known, Dr. <HI>Chandler</HI> was &s;everely cen&s;ured, and which was at lea&s;t, as criminal, in the <HI>Whig</HI>'s Opinion, as Sin again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Point (viz. the Expence) <HI>the good</HI> Doctor gets over, by &s;uppo&s;ing it to be borne by the Society for propaga|ting the Go&s;pel&mdash;In an&s;wer to which, I &s;hall at this Time, only produce the Words of a late Writer in the pre&s;ent Contro|ver&s;y&mdash;<Q>That the Society (&s;ays he) does not bear the Expence of tho&s;e who go hence to <HI>England</HI> for Orders, is a Fact as true, and as well known, as that <HI>England</HI> lies on one Side of the Atlantic and <HI>America</HI> on the other.&mdash; Queen ANNE indeed provided, that the Sum of <HI>Twenty Pounds,</HI> &s;hould be paid out of the Public Trea&s;ury, to &s;uch Clergymen as went from <HI>England</HI> to &s;ettle in the Plantations; and out of this Bounty, Mi&s;&s;ionaries, I am informed, gene|rally received &s;omewhat more than <HI>Nineteen Pounds.</HI> But what is this to the Expence of a Voyage to <HI>England,</HI> and a|nother back again?</Q></P>
<P>As to the third Point, the Doctor thinks it &s;ufficient, if he can <HI>invent</HI> other probable Cau&s;es to account for it,&mdash;To
<PB N="165" REF="011212_0087_0F862D8C4332AE08">&s;hew the Futility of them, would be too tedious at pre&s;ent.&mdash; But even if we allow them to exi&s;t, the Hard&s;hips re&s;ulting from the Ca&s;e of Ordination, mu&s;t, by all Men of Candour, be allowed to co-operate with them, and even of them&s;elves, to be &s;ufficient to produce that Effect.</P>
<P>The fourth and la&s;t Point is, the impo&s;&s;ibility that a Bi&s;hop in <HI>England</HI> &s;hould be acquainted with the Characters of tho&s;e who go home for Orders&mdash;Upon this, the Doctor remarks, <Q>that the Ca&s;e would not be altered for the better, were there a Bi&s;hop in <HI>America,</HI>" becau&s;e, (as he &s;ays) "the greater Part by far of tho&s;e who would go to him for Orders, would be as unknown to him, by Rea&s;on of their great Di&s;tance from <HI>his Seat,</HI> as to a Bi&s;hop in <HI>England</HI></Q>&mdash;And be&s;ides, he &s;uppo&s;es, <Q>that a Commi&s;&s;ary might as well prevent this Mi&s;chief as Bi&s;hops, as far at it can be prevented.</Q>&mdash;"But can we imagine, that a Bi&s;hop would be con&s;tantly immured at his Seat, (as the Doctor calls it) &s;o as to receive all his Knowledge of Per&s;ons and Characters in the &s;ame defective Way, which he mu&s;t do in <HI>England?</HI> May we not rather imagine, that he would vi&s;it, at &s;tated Times, the &s;everal Parts of the Continent; and thereby become acquainted with the Sentiments of the Public, and receive Intelligence, <HI>Viv&acirc; Voce,</HI> from &s;uch Per&s;ons as were be&s;t able to give it?&mdash;By this Method, almo&s;t all Po&s;&s;ibility of Forgery and Deception would be prevented: Nay, he might be able to ob&s;erve the Con|duct of Candidates for the Mini&s;try "from their Youth up|wards," beginning with them at the &s;everal Seminaries of Learn|ing where they are educated.</P>
<P>The Appointment of a Commi&s;&s;ary, would be but a bad <HI>Succedanium;</HI> becau&s;e the &s;ame dangerous and expen&s;ive Voyage would remain, and Credentials, as from him, might be forged without the Po&s;&s;ibility of a &s;peedy Detection; and tho' the Fraud might chance not to e&s;cape the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI>'s Pe|netration, yet it could &s;carce &s;ail of Succe&s;s, where the Order of Bi&s;hops is &s;o numerous as it is in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;hort, there is nothing like having the Per&s;on who is to ordain, upon the Spot; where he may "&s;ee with his own Eyes, and hear with his own Ears; whereas when at a Di&s;|tance he is liable to be impo&s;ed upon by a Thou&s;and Artifices.</P>
<P>The Members of the CHURCH do not want, by introducing a Bi&s;hop, to procure a religious E&s;tabli&s;hment, as Doctor <HI>Chaun|cey</HI> declares, and the <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Centinel</HI> impudently a&s;&s;ert<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&mdash; If the CHURCH is not already e&s;tabli&s;hed, that Mea&s;ure in it&s;elf can never do it&mdash;The Members of the CHURCH are Ene|mies by Principle to Per&s;ecution; but they will not tamely
<PB N="166" REF="011212_0088_0F862D8D0AF66D50">give up the Rights of Con&s;cience.&mdash;They cannot &s;it down quietly, and &s;ee the Church in&s;ulted and reviled; on the contrary, they are determined to do them&s;elves Ju&s;tice by all the Methods of Rea&s;on and Moderation; and above all Things, to <HI>"hold fa&s;t &s;tedfa&s;tly the Profe&s;&s;ion of their Faith,"</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are the Sentiments of all true CHURCHMEN, and the&s;e will ever be the Sentiments of,</P>

<P>THE nature of Chri&s;tianity, and the errand and duties of a mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel con&s;idered, what an be more ma|nife&s;t than that the thir&s;t of the clergy after civil authority mu&s;t be both mi&s;chievous and criminal. They are &s;ent out <HI>to be&s;eech Men to be reconciled unto God;</HI> and the &s;ucce&s;s of their negotiations depends upon the harmony of their lives with prin|ciples of the mo&s;t exalted refinements.&mdash;Principles utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with the pur&s;uit of worldly plea&s;ures and the intan|gling cares of the magi&s;tracy.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e for in&s;tance that Dr. Chandler's little flock at Eliza|beth-Town, &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of but five hundred &s;ouls; I ven|ture to affirm, that the con&s;cientious di&s;charge of his duty &s;carce
<PB N="167" REF="011212_0088_0F862D8D0AF66D50">leaves him time for common recreation. Be&s;ides what he owes to him&s;elf as a Chri&s;tian (and the be&s;t may cry out, who is &s;ufficient for the &s;piritual warfare?) how immen&s;e the load in|duced by his office of a &s;hepherd, <HI>who watches for their &s;ouls!</HI> &mdash;I &s;hall &s;ay nothing of the painful pur&s;uits of his &s;tudies, his public exerci&s;es in &s;ea&s;on and out of &s;ea&s;on, his catechitical lectures and periodical attendances at his chamber as a <HI>Ductor Dubitantium,</HI> to &s;olve ca&s;es of con&s;cience:&mdash;His parochial vi&s;its alone open to view a field of labour that mu&s;t make any mini&s;ter tremble who would not have the <HI>blood of his people found in his &s;kirts.</HI> The pa&s;toral care is to extend to all; &s;ome are to be in&s;tructed and others reproved.&mdash;The incautious are to be admoni&s;hed, the &s;luggi&s;h to be quickened&mdash; Encouragement mu&s;t be applied to the faint-hearted; and the back&s;lider, if po&s;&s;ible recovered. In a word, as the variety of their ca&s;es is endle&s;s, &s;o are his fatigues, each demands &s;kill and addre&s;s, and &s;ome will pierce a tender heart with the mo&s;t pungent di&s;tre&s;s. What a ta&s;k to &s;tand ready for &s;ick and death bed calls! How is the pre&s;umptious to be convinced? who can &s;ap the delu&s;ive hopes of hypocrites, and &s;upport tho&s;e of the dying tymid believer? But I forbear, the anxieties of the pi|ous mini&s;ter mu&s;t be inconceivable: And charged with duties &s;o various, what can be more ab&s;urd and cruel than to encrea&s;e the burden by civil concerns foreign to his function? What more mi&s;chievous than to abate his indu&s;try in &s;o glorious a work, by the intoxications of worldly wealth and honour? Such a good &s;hepherd the Doctor is or ought to be.&mdash;And &s;eems it not &s;trange then to find him contending for the inve&s;titure of the clergy with powers repugnant to their offices? Conceiving, as it was natural, that the bi&s;hops whom he is de&s;irous of having in this country, might meet with preferment to civil tru&s;ts, and the clergy under their patronage be con&s;tituted judges and ju|&s;tices; and that the colonies might thence take an alarm; he endeavours to ju&s;tify &s;uch appointments, and two pages of his appeal are devoted to obviate objections to a mea&s;ure for which fifty thou&s;and volumes would be utterly in&s;ufficient; &s;ince rea|&s;on, revelation and the experience of all nations con&s;pire to teach us the le&s;&s;on, that nothing can be more dangerous to church and &s;tate, than the participation of the clergy in the power of the magi&s;trates.&mdash;Of all orders they are mo&s;t prone to per|&s;ecute.&mdash;Such is the &s;ect.&mdash;It &s;tands recorded in the hi&s;tory of the world, in characters of blood.&mdash;The nature of their creeds makes no difference.&mdash;In this re&s;pect the poet a&s;&s;erts, an undeniable truth, that <HI>prie&s;ts of all religions are the &s;ame.</HI>&mdash;Nay, the Chri&s;tian clergy &s;eem to have &s;urpa&s;&s;ed
<PB N="168" REF="011212_0089_0F862D8DA82E7020">the Pagan prie&s;thood, as much in their cruelties, as in the refi|ned morality they were &s;ent out to inculcate. Power in the hands of eccle&s;ia&s;tics, rai&s;ed antichri&s;t in the very bo&s;om of the Chri&s;tian church; and if we may judge from what is pa&s;t, ci|vil authority can never be intru&s;ted to the clergy with &s;afety to the people.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is far from the author's de&s;ign to depart from the honour due to the heralds of the religion of Je&s;us, who as &s;uch de&s;erve the highe&s;t re&s;pect: The clergy can boa&s;t, and I confe&s;s it with plea&s;ure, the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed ornaments of humanity.

The per&s;ecuted if lifted to power will per&s;ecute in their turn. The clergy are &s;ure prompters; and it is worth a remark, that when the people of New-England, who were per&s;ecuted out of Old-En|gland, per&s;ecuted the Quakers, they were in a manner ruled by their mini&s;ters.&mdash;And if this mo&s;t peaceable of all &s;ects had the &s;ame opportunities, and a clergy to &s;timulate them, over|come by the pa&s;&s;ions and infirmities common to fallible mortals, they would doubtle&s;s revenge the oppre&s;&s;ions which their ance|&s;tors have felt both in Europe and America.

<P>Here are above one hundred thou&s;and as happy &s;ubjects as any upon the face of the earth, and the more &s;o, for being &s;plit into many different prote&s;tant denominations. We live here in Chri&s;tian fellow&s;hip, and the liberty and peace of the go&s;pel. &mdash;In this delightful branch of the empire, the rights of con&s;cience are &s;hackled by no religious te&s;t laws.&mdash;Every loyal prote&s;tant is a candidate for public honours; can offer his &s;ervice, and receive the rewards and munificence of the crown. &mdash;whether of one denomination or another, he is expo&s;ed to no penalties on the &s;core of his religion, but being left to the unbia&s;&s;ed dictates of his own con&s;cience, may wor&s;hip God as he plea&s;es.&mdash;No &s;ect has a general odious preheminence, and without e&s;tabli&s;hments, tythes or church-rates (a &s;mall tax not univer&s;al only expected) we abound with churches and places of wor&s;hip, beyond the cen&s;ure even of the bi&s;hop of Landaff; have rai&s;ed them by our own free and voluntary contributions, and without the compul&s;ion of laws, maintain a clergy, proportion|ed to our numbers, and but for a few in&s;tances, as unexception|able as any in all Chri&s;tendom.</P>
<P>Thanks to the wi&s;dom and policy of our Dutch ance&s;tors, for this happy exemption from penal and per&s;ecuting laws, and the glorious liberty we enjoy. If the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of this colony, who were all of the national reformed church of the United
<PB N="170" REF="011212_0090_0F862D8E65413F28">Netherlands, had been bigots to their own per&s;ua&s;ion, it would often, in ancient days, have been ea&s;y for them to take advan|tages of nece&s;&s;itous Governors; and procure, if not acts un|friendly to Chri&s;tian liberty, at lea&s;t di&s;criminating immunities, and ill-policied endowments, out of the vacant lands of the crown.&mdash;But in&s;pired by the principles of generous tole|ration, they contented them&s;elves with the &s;aith of the Engli&s;h nation, in the capitulatory articles at the &s;urrender by which they a&s;ked nothing but the liberty of con&s;cience, in wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline,&mdash;and tho' once worried and trapanned by a bi|gotted governor, into a law that expo&s;ed them&s;elves and their po&s;terity (not excepting their own clergy) to a perpetual tax in four counties, levied for the u&s;e of clergymen, of whom, &s;ome at lea&s;t, as mi&s;&s;ionaries of the &s;ociety for propagating the go&s;pel, were at the &s;ame time receiving &s;upport, like objects of charity, out of a fund rai&s;ed by the alms of the people of England.&mdash; I &s;ay, all this notwith&s;tanding, they &s;corned to re&s;ent the provocation, have &s;een, without envy, the di&s;tingui&s;hing libera|lity of Fletcher and Cornbury, to a &s;ect fed out of their own bowels, and even in its infancy, a&s;piring at a preheminence: And though in a &s;ub&s;equent period, by the devolution of the command upon Pre&s;ident Schuyler, the whole legi&s;lative autho|rity was in the hands of the Dutch; yet &s;o far from making repri&s;als, they have not even attemping the repeal of the church-tax; but only avoided a repetition of that error. And to their wi&s;dom and genero&s;ity we owe that influx of prote&s;tants, which adds daily to our pro&s;perity, and is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the cultivation, and &s;o advantageous to the landed intere&s;t of the colony.</P>
<P>But to whatever cau&s;e our liberty and felicity is to be a&s;cribed, certain it is, that the permanence and &s;ecurity of both greatly depend upon the partition of power, among our various deno|minations, and the wi&s;dom and impartiality of the government. With two of the three branches of the legi&s;lature, in favour of the epi&s;copalians; I mean the governor and council, who are generally of that per&s;ua&s;ion, and with the power of the crown and the nation, to protect them; that &s;ect hath &s;uch a bulwark of defence, that every &s;tep taken to increa&s;e their &s;ecurity, ought to be con&s;idered as a demon&s;tration, that not their own &s;afety, but mi&s;chief to other, is the true end in view.&mdash; The &s;trength of the Dutch, and other non-epi&s;copalians, con|&s;i&s;ts in their power to maintain a majority in the a&s;&s;embly. To which, as contributors of near nine tenths of all taxes, they ought to be ever attentive; and more e&s;pecially, now mea&s;ures are pur&s;uing by the epi&s;copal clergy, to wriggle them&s;elves into

Let us mention a few of the innumerable complaints to which it will infallibly give ri&s;e.&mdash; And,</P>
<P N="1">1. As a bi&s;hop at the council board, with the clergy as ju|&s;tices and judges of the quorum, and all their dependent bigots in his train, and the intere&s;t of the reverend bench in England on his &s;ide, will in&s;tantly po&s;&s;e&s;s a power, at which every go|vernor, and e&s;pecially a nece&s;&s;itous one, will tremble; two branches of our legi&s;lature mu&s;t fall a &s;acrifice to prie&s;t-craft, and every mea&s;ure of government thenceforth be dictated by eccle&s;ia&s;tical zeal.&mdash;A bi&s;hop upon &s;uch ground, will be more than mortal, if his pride and haughtine&s;s is not exci|ted; and that governor and council po&s;&s;e&s;s an uncommon &s;pirit of courage, who dare to check the in&s;olence of a prie&s;t, who&s;e influence will be &s;ufficient by a &s;ingle letter, to reduce them to po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itical non entities.&mdash;And here, good Doctor, what a &s;ource for complaints have you overlooked!</P>
<P N="2">2 With &s;uch an a&s;cendency in the prelates (which would be greater here than that of all the bi&s;hops put together in En|gland) and the lower clergy for judges and ju&s;tices in our coun|ties; can any man but Dr. Chandler, be &s;o betle eyed, as not to &s;ee, that <HI>the people immediately concerned in their proceedings, may be far otherwi&s;e affected, than if they were mere lay-men?</HI> Will tho&s;e motly compounds of Mo&s;es and Aaron, po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uch angelic perfection, that no man, not even an anti-epi&s;copalian, will ever have any great cau&s;e to complain?&mdash;The Dr. indeed may be con&s;cious of his own impartiality, and fitne&s;s to determine a controver&s;y between one of his church-wardens and a lay-elder of the Pre&s;byterian conventicle at Elizabeth-Town; but all who are &s;trangers to the rectitude and internal operati|ons of his mind, would be apt to think the cau&s;e in the hands of a worthy lay-ju&s;tice, upon a more eligible footing; and that as but few of the mi&s;&s;ionaries can pretend to the qualifications
<PB N="172" REF="011212_0091_0F862D8F22A41A60">which have rendered the Dr. &s;o famous, complaints again&s;t the judgment of &s;uch eccle&s;ia&s;tico-political judges, would be nei|ther few nor ill-grounded.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, If the places of honour not military; for it is not pro|po&s;ed at pre&s;ent, as far as I am informed, that the clergy &s;hould have any command as officers in the militia; I &s;ay, if the only places of honour and profit are to be committed to the clergy, what &s;hort work will &s;uch powerful election-jobbers have, in &s;e|curing the voices for the choice of an A&s;&s;embly man? Only &s;up|po&s;e then, the new bi&s;hop concerned in a plan with the enemies of America, in the mother country; (which is no improbable &s;uppo&s;ition) and the colony legi&s;lature at his back, and ideas pre&s;ent them&s;elves that fills the mind with con&s;ternation and horror.</P>
<P N="4">4thly, Tho' a dabbler in politics may apprehend no mi&s;chief of this kind, it is mo&s;t of all to be wondered at, that an endoc|torated divine &s;hould be &s;o blind as not to fore&s;ee any great complaints neither from men of honour and ju&s;tice, or of real and undi&s;&s;embled piety, even of his own denomination.&mdash; Will not a re&s;ort to the bi&s;hop's palace at New-York or Albany, for the purpo&s;e of plea&s;ure, preferment and intrigue, occa&s;ion their non-re&s;idence at their cures?&mdash;And are not their flocks in danger of being unfed, and expo&s;ed by the pro&s;titution of their time and talents, to affairs of private litigation, the commitment and puni&s;hment of felons, the indemnity of the pari&s;h from ba&s;tards, and that infinity of bu&s;ine&s;s, which our laws have committed to ju&s;tices of the peace, and e&s;pecially to tho&s;e of the quorum.</P>
<P>Let the&s;e hints &s;uffice for the pre&s;ent, to refute the pernicious doctrine of the appeal.&mdash;A doctrine that will, if carried into practice, give ri&s;e to complaints from all quarters.&mdash; The Doctor can &s;ee no very great rea&s;on for any, but tho' his pamphlet is recommended by a round allegation, that "nothing has been a&s;&s;erted in the cour&s;e of his <HI>work,</HI> but what he believes upon good evidence to be true," yet thou&s;ands are apprehen&s;ive of complaints, from all parts and denominations, not excepting even the Prelate and the Doctor him&s;elf.&mdash;A project that will fill us with jealou&s;ies, and tend to &s;ubjugate us to the mo&s;t mercile&s;s thraldom, will fir&s;t excite the complaints of the people, and then end in an enquiry for which the author and the in&s;tru|ment will doubtle&s;s have rea&s;on to complain, both of them&s;elves and each other.</P>
<P>If the Doctor had any view of this, it appeared to him afar off, and hence perhaps the information to his &s;uperiors that the pre&s;ent time, of all others be&s;t &s;avoured his &s;cheme.&mdash;
<PB N="173" REF="011212_0091_0F862D8F22A41A60">But the mo&s;t urgent motive was omitted, to wit, that the Ame|ricans had as yet no rich independent Barons as in the mother country, to curb the new prelates and keep them to order, but for this very rea&s;on (a rea&s;on not proper to be even hinted in the appeal) every real Chri&s;tian,&mdash;every &s;on of liberty, ought to &s;tand upon his guard, and prote&s;t again&s;t the inve&s;ti|tures of the clergy with powers &s;o repugnant to the pure and holy religion we profe&s;s. Security again&s;t this fruitful &s;ource of di&s;tre&s;s we demand; but it is &s;o far from being offered, that the very advocate for an epi&s;copate not only confe&s;&s;es this po&s;&s;i|ble, that his bi&s;hops may acquire civil powers and preferments, but very &s;agaciou&s;ly, and doubtle&s;s keeping the grand end of his appeal in &s;ight, pleads for the di&s;tribution of a &s;hare, not only to their lord&s;hips the bi&s;hops, but to their inferior clergy. We &s;ee then what kind of primitive epi&s;copacy America is to be ble&s;|&s;ed with, had &s;ome men their aims.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE XIVth Num. of the <HI>American Whig</HI> con&s;i&s;ts of a very <HI>curious</HI> Letter, u&s;hered in by a very <HI>furious</HI> Introduction. What it was, that added this extraordinary Degree of Acidity to the native Sourne&s;s of the <HI>Whig</HI>'s Temper, is but little to the Purpo&s;e. <HI>Chymi&s;ts</HI> tells us, that <HI>Acids</HI> when mixed with <HI>Al|kalies,</HI> i. e. with Things of a Nature contrary to their own, produce the mo&s;t furious and di&s;tructive Fermentations. Po&s;&s;i|bly our <HI>Whig</HI> had &s;een a <HI>Tory,</HI> a <HI>Jacobite,</HI> or what is ten times wor&s;e in <HI>his</HI> Opinion, a <HI>good hone&s;t</HI> CHURCHMAN:&mdash; Po&s;&s;ibly <HI>Con&s;cience</HI>&mdash;a <HI>Thing</HI> as oppo&s;ite to the Nature of a <HI>thorough</HI> Whig, as <HI>Alkalies</HI> to <HI>Acids</HI>&mdash;had given him a <HI>whipping</HI> through one of my Papers, for the many ba&s;e De&s;igns that he is by every Art carrying on, to the great Di&s;|turbance of his Maje&s;ty's liege Subjects.&mdash;But however uncertain we may be with Regard to the <HI>Cau&s;e,</HI> the <HI>Effect</HI> is e|vident: A mo&s;t <HI>furiou&s;ly flu&s;tratious Ferment</HI> &s;eized him, which &s;pent it&s;elf in <HI>foaming, fuming,</HI> and <HI>fretting,</HI> again&s;t every Per|&s;on that hath &s;o much Regard to <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>primitive Chri&s;ti|anity,</HI> as to open his Mouth, or u&s;e his Pen, in Defence of the <HI>venerable</HI> and <HI>Apo&s;tolic</HI> Order of BISHOPS, and in Support of the <HI>natural, civil</HI> and <HI>religious</HI> Rights of the CHURCH in <HI>Ame|rica.</HI> All &s;uch Per&s;ons are by him denominated <Q><HI>&s;hamele&s;s Scribblers,&mdash;Scribblers,</HI> who in open Defiance of all <HI>Mode&s;ty</HI> and <HI>Decorum,</HI> are engaged in perverting Truth, propagating Fal&s;hood, <HI>out-raging common Sen&s;e,</HI> and abu|&s;ing without Offence given, the mo&s;t numerous Denominati|on of Chri&s;tians in this Province.</Q></P>
<P>Would not a Per&s;on who knew nothing of our <HI>Whig,</HI> but what might be gathered from this Sentence, be led to con&s;ider him as a <HI>very ba&s;hful, &s;hamefaced &s;ort of a Man,</HI> who had never <HI>&s;cribbled</HI> in his Life!&mdash;One, that had <HI>monopolized</HI> all

One, that ne|ver was <HI>engaged</HI> in <HI>perverting Truth,</HI> and <HI>propagating Fal&s;hood?</HI> &mdash;And would not the Per&s;on, who &s;hould make the&s;e Con|clu&s;ions, be <HI>mo&s;t abominably mi&s;taken?</HI>&mdash;Of all Men in the <HI>World</HI> the <HI>Whig</HI> &s;hould have been the la&s;t, to have mentioned <HI>&s;cribbling</HI> as a Mark of Reproach; or noticed the Want of <HI>Mo|de&s;ty</HI> and <HI>Decorum</HI> in any one; or any Thing about <HI>perverting Truth,</HI> or <HI>propagating Fal&s;hood:</HI>&mdash;For what <HI>Scribbler</HI> is more a <HI>Scribbler</HI> than him&s;elf, or more <HI>&s;hamele&s;s?</HI>&mdash;Who ever wrote more "in open Defiance of all <HI>Mode&s;ty</HI> and <HI>Deco|rum?</HI>&mdash;Who was ever more laboriou&s;ly diligent in <HI>tortur|ing</HI> and <HI>"perverting Truth."</HI> and "propagating Fal&s;hood," than the <HI>American Whig?</HI>&mdash;Name the Man, <HI>et eris mihi magnus Apollo.</HI></P>
<P>What the Whig means by <HI>"out-raging common &s;en&s;e,"</HI> I confe&s;s I know not. Had he given us a little more <HI>common Sen&s;e,</HI> and a little le&s;s <HI>Rage,</HI> po&s;&s;ibly I &s;hould have under&s;tood him bet|ter: But to <HI>his</HI> and <HI>my</HI> Misfortune, the <HI>Ebullition</HI> of the <HI>Fer|ment</HI> of his Brain, hath been &s;o <HI>&s;uperlatively flu&s;tratious,</HI> that his Rage hath run away with his common Sen&s;e, ju&s;t as hone&s;t <HI>Teague</HI>'s Legs ran away with their Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>I come now to the Letter, which this <HI>flu&s;tratious</HI> Introducti|on pre&s;ents to us, as the genuine Production of a Member of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Church. The <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Churches in this Pro|vince, have ever been mutually happy, in the good Under&s;tand|ing that hath &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them, and I hope ever will &s;ub|&s;i&s;t; notwith&s;tanding the vile Endeavours of the <HI>American Whig,</HI> and his <HI>Tools,</HI> to &s;ow Jealou&s;ies and Animo&s;ities in the Brea&s;ts of the&s;e two Si&s;ters.</P>
<P>When I &s;aid in a former Paper that the Power of Ordinati|on in the Church of <HI>Holland,</HI> was confined to the Cla&s;&s;is, and was not given to every ordinary Pa&s;tor, I &s;aid it upon the Au|thority of a Per&s;on, whom I know to be every Way qualified to judge of the Truth of what he affirmed; and utterly incapa|ble of &s;aying in this Ca&s;e, what he did not know to be true. &mdash;But&mdash;waving all other Arguments, and A&s;&s;ertions, let us come to the Matter of Fact.&mdash;If the ordinary Pa&s;|tors of the Church of <HI>Holland</HI> have the Power of Ordination, di&s;tinct from the Cla&s;&s;is, how comes it, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> Mini&s;ters in this Province do not ordain? If it be &s;aid, that there have been In&s;tances of their ordaining.&mdash;I beg to be informed, whether a Schi&s;m does not &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Church, upon that Account, among others?</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="011212_0093_0F862D93800BAC48">With Regard to the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI>'s unchurching all the Prote&s;tant Reformed Churches, I again deny it. On the contrary, &s;he hath ever looked upon them with the mo&s;t friendly Regard, and hath given them all the A&s;&s;i&s;tance that hath been in her Power. She &s;ettled her own-Church Government, as &s;he &s;uppo&s;es, upon the &s;ure Word of God, and left others to judge for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Whatever is darkly, or not fully expre&s;&s;ed, in the Writings of the in&s;pired Penmen of the New Te&s;tament, is be&s;t explained by the Practice of the Primitive Chri&s;tians&mdash;and their Prac|tice can be known only from Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory. Now, be|&s;ides the Te&s;timony of the Holy Scriptures in favour of Epi&s;co|pacy, we have the joint Practice of the univer&s;al Chri&s;tian Church, from the Apo&s;tles' Days, 'til within a little more than Two Hundred Years. The Argument, from the Practice of the Primitive Church, is ju&s;t as &s;trong in Favour of Epi&s;copa|cy, as it is in Favour of the Fir&s;t-Day Sabbath, or Lord's Day; or as it is in Favour of Infant Bapti&s;m, or admitting Women to the Lord's Supper. When therefore, our Adver&s;a|ries will produce a plain, po&s;itive Text of Scripture, enjoining the baptizing of Infants, or the ob&s;erving the fir&s;t Day of the Week, as a Day of public Wor&s;hip, or for admitting Women to the Lord's Supper; then I will produce as plain and as &s;trong a one in Favour of Epi&s;copacy.&mdash;And when the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> will prove her <HI>Kirk Se&s;&s;ions,</HI> her <HI>Pre&s;byteries,</HI> her Provincial Synods, her General A&s;&s;emblies, to be <HI>jure divine,</HI> &mdash;and if they are not <HI>jure divino,</HI> they are mere Crea|tures of the State, and owe their Being to Acts of Parli|ament&mdash;I will then prove, that <HI>Spiritual Courts</HI> are <HI>jure divino.</HI></P>
<P>But if the Di&s;&s;enters, either in <HI>England</HI> or the <HI>Colonies,</HI> think they &s;tand upon the &s;ame foot of Innocency, in their Sepera|tion from the CHURCH, that <HI>Foreign</HI> Prote&s;tants do, in depart|ing from the Mode of Wor&s;hip, &amp;c. e&s;tabli&s;hed in England, they are much mi&s;taken. The Charge of <HI>Schi&s;m,</HI> in divi|ding and rending a National Reformed Church, without any tolerable Rea&s;on, will be their la&s;ting Reproach in this World; and, it is much to be feared, the Condemnation of &s;ome of them in the World to come.</P>
<P>The Church, it is true, holds and teaches the Nece&s;&s;ity of an uninterrupted Succe&s;&s;ion of Ordinations&mdash;from the Apo&s;tles, in order to qualify any Man for the Chri&s;tian Prie&s;t|hood, or Mini&s;tration: And if any Per&s;ons, who are con&s;cious that their Ordinations are in this Re&s;pect <HI>irregular</HI> and <HI>defective,</HI> will fly to the Con&s;equences, and talk of being <HI>unchurched, un|chri&s;tianed,</HI>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>The nece&s;&s;ity of American bi&s;hops from the want of confirmation con&s;idered.&mdash;</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AS my controver&s;y is not with the church of England, but with tho&s;e of the bigots of that communion, who contend for an American epi&s;copate; I have, through the whole cour&s;e of the&s;e papers, avoided to oppugn any tenet or ceremony held by epi&s;copalians, except in tho&s;e in&s;tances in
<PB N="178" REF="011212_0094_0F862D943735DD88">which the great champion for the convention hath rendered it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, by inducing therefrom an argument in fa|vour of his darling project. For this rea&s;on, I &s;hould deem <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t no concern of mine, did every man in America, think proper to have him&s;elf confirmed every day of the year. But is confir|mation urged as an argument for introducing &s;piritual lords in|to his Maje&s;ty's dominions, and repre&s;ented as Dr. Chandler does, in a &s;en&s;e not held by the church to which he belongs; the refutition of it falls directly within any province, and I &s;hall accordingly con&s;ider it, without the lea&s;t intention of giving of|fence to any man, and caring very little what offence is taken at it, by tho&s;e who have lately thought fit to urge it in their &s;er|mons, in order to di&s;quiet weak minds, and increa&s;e the party in favour of an American prelate.</P>
<P>As ambition ever wants a ladder to climb to dignity, it is not wonderful to find a certain &s;ett of clergymen in this country, &s;o fond of introducing the hierarchy among us. Could their a&s;piring views be gratified without danger to the religious liber|ties of millions, we &s;hould make no objections; but until they have convinced us, by demon&s;trative arguments, that an epi&s;co|pate upon the Engli&s;h plan, will not be productive of the like events in America, which it has produced in England, we &s;hall never cea&s;e to oppo&s;e, as men, who have at &s;take the mo&s;t in|valuable of all priveleges on this &s;ide of Heaven; in which op|po&s;ition we are &s;ure of forty-five fiftieths of all America to back us.</P>
<P>Doctor Chandler and his brethren are &s;en&s;ible that one of the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful artifices to blind the populace, is to per&s;uade them, that without &s;uch a dignitary they mu&s;t want &s;ome pri|vilege e&s;&s;ential to their &s;alvation; or at lea&s;t to their advance|ment in religion. To this purpo&s;e the want of confirmation is urged as a grievance, only to be moved by his Lord&s;hip's arri|val. And indeed if the people are convinced that they cannot be confirmed in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion or enjoyment of the gifts and graces of our divine religion, without the <HI>laying on of the hands</HI> of a prelate; if the <HI>&s;anctifying,</HI> if the <HI>quickening,</HI> nay, if the &s;mall|e&s;t degree of the <HI>preventing</HI> and <HI>comforting influences</HI> of the &s;acred &s;pirit, is confined to the hands of a bi&s;hop, or confer|red by this boa&s;ted rite, I applaud the convention in their pur|&s;uit of a <HI>mitred apo&s;tle.</HI>&mdash;No temporal good bears any pro|portion to this &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ing; and we might chearfully con|&s;ent to the lo&s;s of many privileges could we thereby obtain men of &s;uch exten&s;ive power and utility.</P>
<P>But I fancy there are few of the &s;en&s;ible epi&s;copalians them|&s;elves in this country, &s;o much the dupes to prie&s;tcraft, or &s;o
<PB N="179" REF="011212_0094_0F862D943735DD88">ignorant of their bibles, as not to know that there is not the lea&s;t &s;hadow of &s;uch a thing in the &s;acred volume. And does the Doctor him&s;elf really believe, that the <HI>gift of the holy &s;pirit</HI> in any kind or degree, is in <HI>this our day,</HI> conferred by the hards of a man? Can it be imagined by any rational creature, acquainted with the oeconomy of our religion, that the prevent|ing and &s;aving operations of the almighty &s;pirit, ever were, or now are at the di&s;po&s;al of a bi&s;hop?&mdash;That they may be conferred by a worm of the du&s;t when he plea&s;es? Were this the ca&s;e, adoration it&s;elf would only be a &s;ufficient honour paid to his Lord&s;hip whenever he came!</P>
<P>Will the Doctor an&s;wer us, that tho' the holy gho&s;t is not in reality conveyed by that means, it is neverthele&s;s appointed as <HI>a &s;ign of its actual conveyance</HI> to the per&s;on confirmed, <HI>"to certify him of God's gracious favour and goodne&s;s?"</HI> We cannot but a&s;k whether the bi&s;hop is to <HI>certify</HI> this to <HI>all,</HI> without di|&s;tinction, or to tho&s;e only <HI>who make the profe&s;&s;ion with &s;inceri|ty?</HI> If only to the latter, he had need to be <HI>the &s;earcher of hearts,</HI> to be &s;ure that they are &s;incere: If to all without di|&s;tinction (as is u&s;ually done) tho' many are mo&s;t in&s;incere and ungodly, then he <HI>certifies to them a fal&s;hood.</HI> Nor can we &s;uppo&s;e that God ever gave him power to ratify and confirm that, as a fact, to any one, which in mo&s;t in&s;tances mu&s;t prove fal&s;e, and in all is uncertain.</P>
<P>Will it be &s;aid, that the impo&s;ition of hands is only a <HI>&s;ign to &s;ignify the giving the holy gho&s;t, to enable us to fulfill the conditi|on of the go&s;pel covenant?</HI> Then is this <HI>rite</HI> erected into a <HI>&s;a|crament</HI> of equal importance with bapti&s;m it&s;elf; and the church of England has at lea&s;t three &s;acraments; for her own definition of a &s;acrament is <Q><HI>an outward and vi&s;ible &s;ign of an inward and &s;piritual grace, given unto us, ordained by Chri&s;t him&s;elf, as a means whereby we receive the &s;ame, and a pledge to a&s;&s;ure us thereof.</HI></Q> But I can as ea&s;ily believe that there are <HI>&s;even &s;acraments,</HI> as that there are <HI>three.</HI></P>
<P>I wi&s;h the Doctor had been a little more explicit, and told us di&s;tinctly, what he means by confirmation, and what end it an|&s;wers. He has, it is true, given us a &s;ketch of the confirma|tion office, by which to gue&s;s it out; but that is as confu&s;ed as his own de&s;cription. However on reading the 23d page, or thereabouts, it would appear to us, that the mo&s;t important part of confirmation is, the <HI>conferring of the holy gho&s;t by the impo&s;ition of hands,</HI> not in his miraculous influences, which he thinks are cea&s;ed, but in his <HI>&s;anctifying and preventing influen|ces.</HI> Now tho' the bare mention of &s;uch a thing is &s;hocking; yet with Americans, with a knowing, an enquiring people,
<PB N="180" REF="011212_0095_0F862D9467922C38">this is urged as an argument for the nece&s;&s;ity of prelatical bi|&s;hops in this country: How greatly to be deplored the unhap|py fate of America, that for near two ages its numerous inha|bitants have been deprived of the mercy of a bi&s;hop's hand!</P>
<P>But the Doctor's notion of confirmation differs from that of the church of England her&s;elf&mdash;his arguments are in|&s;ufficient&mdash;the thing is incon&s;i&s;tent&mdash;and as prac|ti&s;ed in the church of England, pernicious. If I prove the&s;e things, I hope the good people of this country will not be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in their minds for want of an epi&s;copate on this account.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Doctor's notion of confirmation differs from that of the church of England her&s;elf. She only goes &s;o far as to &s;ay, that <Q>It hath been a &s;olemn ancient and <HI>laudable cu&s;tom</HI> continuing from the apo&s;tles times.</Q> But the Doctor is wi|&s;er, and adopts bi&s;hop Taylor's a&s;&s;ertion, that it is an holy rite, a <HI>divine ordinance.</HI> Now in &s;pite of the <HI>Terminus a quo,</HI> or any other ill-quoted &s;crap of &s;chool divinity, I am obliged to conceive that there is a wide difference between an <HI>antient cu&s;tom,</HI> however <HI>laudable,</HI> and a <HI>divine ordinance.</HI> For an ordi|nance I humbly conceive we mu&s;t find &s;ome plain appointment in &s;cripture; and not receive any thing as &s;uch, merely be|cau&s;e uncertain tradition, or the hi&s;tory of the ancients, in|forms us that it was a cu&s;tom in primitive times. If it is an ordinance of God, pray tell us where it is ordained in the word of God; and think not, good Doctor, that we &s;hall take it upon St. Jerome's word, and his infamous mi&s;application of that pa&s;&s;age in the <HI>Acts,</HI> any more that we &s;hall take it upon your own a&s;&s;ertion. That the pa&s;&s;age in Acts is infamou&s;ly mi&s;|applied, we &s;hall pre&s;ently evince. That the <HI>&s;acrament, word</HI> and <HI>prayer,</HI> are divine ordinances, no one can properly di&s;pute, becau&s;e they are plainly ordained in the &s;criptures. But where do we find the in&s;titution of <HI>confirmation</HI> according to the Doc|tors's notion of it, which mu&s;t be more important than ever I conceived any of the &s;acraments to be?</P>
<P>Had the fir&s;t reformers of the church of England, who compo&s;ed the office of confirmation, intended to have it under|&s;tood as a divine ordinance, they would have called it &s;o, in plain terms, and not left the Dr. &s;uch hard labour to prove that they meant &s;o. But as far as I can &s;ee, they never had any &s;uch meaning, and he has plainly perverted their intention. It is well known, that none of the reformed churches did at fir&s;t admit it as a divine in&s;titution; and none but the church of England, paid &s;o much re&s;pect to the church of Rome, as even to
<PB N="181" REF="011212_0095_0F862D9467922C38">retain under the notion of a <HI>laudable cu&s;tom,</HI> what that mi&s;tre&s;s of harlots had taught as a <HI>divine ordinance.</HI> Nay, many of the wi&s;e&s;t Romani&s;ts them&s;elves did at the time of the reformation, give up its being <HI>an ordinance of divine right;</HI> as may be &s;een in the hi&s;tory of the Council of Trent. Nor had it any longer been retained in the Romi&s;h church, had not the influence of the Pope carried it, being thereto incited by a fear of hard im|putations upon the infallibility of the Roman &s;ee. But the Doctor and his high-flying fraternity, are for going back, in|&s;tead of advancing in reformation. In&s;tead of joining his church in calling it only a <HI>laudable cu&s;tom,</HI> he a&s;&s;erts it to be a divine ordinance.</P>
<P>It &s;eems that it was in St. Jerom's day a <HI>laudable cu&s;tom</HI> for mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, or bi&s;hops to <HI>go abroad</HI> to catechi&s;e all who had been baptized, and to implore a ble&s;&s;ing upon them in a &s;olemn manner when he had done. That this was a <HI>laud|able and ancient cu&s;tom</HI> we do not di&s;pute; and indeed the &s;ame cu&s;tom is practi&s;ed in all churches more or le&s;s to this day. Nay would our <HI>zealous, humble and painful</HI> epi&s;copal clergy, in&s;tead of waiting for the bi&s;hop, do more of this kind, it would be no harm. If this is what is meant by confirmati|on, and this is all that was anciently meant by it, as far as I have been able to trace it; I cannot &s;ee why the common Pre&s;by|ter may not do it; or to what &s;trange cau&s;e it is to be a&s;cribed that the whole of this <HI>u&s;eful cu&s;tom</HI> is monopolized by the dio|ce&s;an bi&s;hops</P>
<P>I do not object to the <HI>ancient and laudable cu&s;tom,</HI> of cate|chi&s;ing young per&s;ons, and a&s;king a profe&s;&s;ion of their faith or a&s;&s;ent to their bapti&s;m, before they come to the &s;acrament of the Lord's &s;upper. This &s;ort of confirmation is well enough; but none &s;uppo&s;e a mitred bi&s;hop e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to this. And as to the <HI>po&s;ture in which</HI> a ble&s;&s;ing was anciently implored by the bi&s;hops, whether it was by <HI>laying on of hands.</HI>&mdash; by holding them <HI>erect,</HI> or only <HI>over</HI> the head; what is this to us, while God has left us to choo&s;e in the matter that po&s;ture which to us appears mo&s;t &s;olemn and convenient? If there is any divine in&s;titution of a po&s;ture, let it be produced. But if none, as the ancient mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel u&s;ed their liberty, &s;o let us.&mdash;But when St. Jerom gives to any peculiarities of a cu&s;tom the force of a divine command; and that only be|cau&s;e it was unniver&s;ally con&s;ented to in the church; we mu&s;t differ from him, and not take the <HI>name</HI> of a &s;aint for an ar|gument, If univer&s;al con&s;ent of a church to a thing proves it to be a <HI>divine in&s;titution;</HI> the <HI>giving the Lord's &s;upper to infants</HI> was by divine in&s;titution, for the Doctor can probably inform
<PB N="182" REF="011212_0096_0F862D95275CDBC8">us of the time when this gro&s;s ab&s;urdity was generally con|&s;ented to throughout the Chri&s;tian world.</P>
<P>The truth is, it was cu&s;tomary in the primitive times to ca|techi&s;e, to a&s;k a profe&s;&s;ion of their faith, or an a&s;&s;ent to their engagements in bapti&s;m. In proce&s;s of time this <HI>a&s;&s;ent</HI> came to be called <HI>confirmation,</HI> as therein the catechumen did con|firm and bind him&s;elf a new.&mdash;The bi&s;hop did afterwards u&s;ually pray for a ble&s;&s;ing upon them; as is u&s;ually practi&s;ed in all churches; and this he did in that <HI>po&s;ture</HI> which to him ap|peared proper. This was the <HI>antient and laudable cu&s;tom;</HI> and as long as it continues under that name and &s;o practi&s;ed, we have no objections. But &s;uper&s;tition, ever fond of erecting any good cu&s;tom into an ordinance to be of as much force as any of the po&s;itive in&s;titutions of Chri&s;t, fir&s;t gave this the name of a <HI>divine ordinance,</HI> then made it one of the <HI>&s;even &s;acraments.</HI> The act of the catechumen in <HI>a&s;&s;enting</HI> to his bapti&s;m, was the <HI>confirmation:</HI> But the fondne&s;s of bi&s;hops to a&s;&s;ume importance, led them to teach, that the more e&s;&s;ential part of confirmation was the impo&s;ition of <HI>their</HI> important <HI>hands;</HI> as if this was the ratification of the covenant, and the holy &s;pirit de&s;eended &s;omehow thro' their con&s;ecrated arms.</P>

<P>THE <HI>Whig</HI> No. XVI. is really &s;uch a poor little thing that it is almo&s;t a pity to <HI>kick</HI> it,&mdash;I mu&s;t give it (poor thing!) a touch or two with my toe however.</P>
<P>She, who in England &s;its <HI>law-dignifi'd</HI> among other le&s;s nu|merous and barely <HI>tolerated</HI> denominations, may there perhaps be with &s;ome propriety call'd THE CHURCH; but in this land, the a&s;ylum of our ance&s;tors from her &s;everities, to &s;ee a &s;crib|bling Bigot arrogantly claim the emphatical Title for an hand|full

The one is, <HI>That &s;everal Per&s;ons of different Cha|racters, have of late been mo&s;t eagerly engaged to promulge &s;uch odd, and again&s;t the true Con&s;titution of the Church of</HI> Holland, <HI>diametrically repugnant Notions of the Con&s;titution of the</HI> Dutch Church, <HI>as will inevitably terminate in its Ruin, if imbibed and practically ob&s;erved by the Body of the</HI> Dutch Church.&mdash; Several Things have given the&s;e Gentlemen a favourable Op|portunity of impo&s;ing, not only upon a Number of re&s;pectable Members of the <HI>Dutch Church,</HI> but al&s;o upon many others. As &mdash;the Infancy of the <HI>Dutch Church</HI> in the&s;e Colonies, which prevented the Exerci&s;e of the whole Extent and Plenitude of its Con&s;titution; and nece&s;&s;itated it to adopt &s;uch Mea&s;ures of Regulation and Government, as were adapted to its State and Condition. To <HI>this</HI> are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> People accu&s;tomed, and few
<PB N="186" REF="011212_0098_0F862D9756B52FC8">look any farther for its real Con&s;titution.&mdash;Our Di&s;tance from <HI>Holland,</HI> where it is fully exerci&s;ed.&mdash;The little Opportunity the greate&s;t Part of our People have of reading the <HI>Belgic</HI> Divines on their Church Con&s;titution. Con&s;idering all the&s;e, as <HI>abu&s;ed by Sophi&s;try,</HI> with <HI>&s;ini&s;ter Views to prejudice People,</HI> it appears very probable to me, Sir, that your po&s;itive A&s;&s;ertions, founded on a bare, <HI>I am told,</HI> will go farther with the&s;e <HI>prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Gentlemen,</HI> than my Negative can do. I expect therefore, that neither your&s;elf, nor the re&s;pectable Public, will cen&s;ure me, <HI>for my attempting to reclaim both Truth, and the Church I belong <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o, from the Jaws of their Devourers!</HI></P>
<P>The other Rea&s;on, in Support of my Apology, is, <HI>the pre&s;ent Eccle&s;ia&s;tic State and Condition of the &s;everal Denominations in the&s;e Colonies.</HI> You cannot help but be &s;en&s;ible, Sir, of the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Fires kindled in the&s;e <HI>American</HI> Churches, while you are heating your&s;elf and others by its Flames.

I &s;uppo&s;e it is obvious to every intelligent Reader, that your De&s;cription of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Church was intended, either <HI>to lug it into the Bo&s;om of the Church you belong to,</HI> and <HI>thus into the Plan for</HI> Ameri|can <HI>Bi&s;hops;</HI> or at lea&s;t, <HI>to lull it a&s;leep until your Ends in View were accompli&s;hed.</HI> With Re&s;pect to the Subject of the pre&s;ent Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Debates, I frankly acknowledge, that it appears to me very rea&s;onable, that tho&s;e in <HI>America,</HI> who are not con&s;cientiou&s;ly attached to the Con&s;titution of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as by Law e&s;tabli&s;hed, &s;hould be permitted the Crav|ing of its full Enjoyment here, <HI>Provided that it can be obtained without the Hazard of the Liberties, Privileges and Properties of their Fellow-Subjects.&mdash;I repeat the Provi&s;o!</HI> I can ne|ver con&s;ent to it as rea&s;onable, that one Denomination &s;hould remove many of its Inconveniencies, at the Ri&s;que of the Li|berties, Privileges, and Properties of other Orthodox Denomi|nations, much more numerous than it&s;elf. I do al&s;o &s;incerely declare, that my Scruples in this Re&s;pect have never been re|moved by all what I have &s;een, either in the Appeal, or other Tracts upon the Subject. Thus I think my&s;elf not ju&s;tly liable to the Cen&s;ure of any one, becau&s;e I would undertake to <HI>un|ma&s;k</HI> the <HI>Sophi&s;try</HI> calculated to debauch the Members of the Church I belong to, and prevail with them to promote, in

<HEAD>From Mr. PARKER'S GAZETTE, Oct. 3. The AMERICAN WHIG. [NUMB. XXX.]</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The conclu&s;ion of the Subject began in our la&s;t.</HEAD>
<P N="2">2d. BUT the Doctor's arguments in &s;upport of confirmation, according to his notion of it, are in&s;ufficient. Let him not take it ami&s;s, when I &s;ay they are perfectly weak. The Te&s;timony of the Church of England, the &s;uppo&s;ed antiquity of the practice, and three quotations of &s;cripture, are all he has to produce on this head.</P>
<P>The te&s;timony of the Church of England, has already ap|peared to be rather again&s;t him, as &s;he only avows as an old cu&s;tom, what he in&s;i&s;ts upon as a divine ordinance. And pray is there any need of &s;etting America in an uproar, merely for the &s;upport of an old cu&s;tom, however laudable the Church of England may think it? E&s;pecially when there is no rea&s;on a&s;|&s;ignable, why a Pre&s;byter cannot an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es as well as his Lord&s;hip? But if the Church of England did avow it as an ordinance, we are di&s;po&s;ed in this country to a&s;k her for her vouchers.</P>
<P>As to its antiquity, this writer would have us believe, that it was in the fir&s;t ages of the Church undi&s;puted&mdash;But what means the Doctor, by &s;uch a&s;&s;ertions? Does he &s;uppo&s;e, that no one in America can detect him in &s;uch mi&s;repre&s;entations? Does he imagine the knowledge of ancient facts to be wholly engro&s;&s;ed by him and his fraternity? Let him &s;hew us, if he can, the lea&s;t mention of this rite in any author before Tertullian. Near the beginning of the third century that father mentions this among many mo&s;t ab&s;urd and ridiculous rites, that had al|ready been introduced into the Church. Let him triumph if he will, in the te&s;timony of St. Jerome, which is &s;till later, and indeed over&s;ets it&s;elf, by its ab&s;urd quotation of Acts, as well as by its &s;trenuous arguing for a rite, for which him&s;elf acknow|ledges there was no occa&s;ion, becau&s;e the whole world con|&s;ented.</P>
<P>The ancient good cu&s;tom which the Doctor would have a divine ordinance, has been mo&s;t apparently corrupted by the church of Rome, and adopted by the Church of England, a|greeable to many other parts of their &s;y&s;tem, in which the cler|gy a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves the prerogatives of God.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="190" REF="011212_0100_0F862D991D2FEC80">3. St. Jerome's quotation of that pa&s;&s;age in Acts 8. appears full as ab&s;urd as it does in Doctor Chandler's appeal. Be &s;o kind courteous reader, as to take the New-Te&s;tament, and for your own &s;atisfaction in this matter, turn to the 14th, 15th and 16th ver&s;es of the chapter&mdash;read the whole pa&s;&s;age, and then judge whether there is any thing like confirmation there.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of the ca&s;e is plainly this,&mdash;The go&s;pel had been preached in Samaria&mdash;many of tho&s;e mongrel Jews believed it, and were baptized.&mdash;The apo&s;tles hearing this, &s;ent two of their number, <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> to &s;trengthen them and confer upon them the miraculous gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t; and this was u&s;ually done by the 'laying on of hands and prayer.' The effect of which was that 'they &s;pake with tongues &amp;c.' By this, they them&s;elves were not only &s;trengthen|ed, but each private Chri&s;tian, had thereby the means in his hands of giving conviction to others. And it is remarkable, that this gift of the Holy Gho&s;t was &s;ometimes conferred before bapti&s;m, as in the ca&s;e of Cornelius the centurion, and tho&s;e who were with him; from which it appears to a demon&s;tration, that it was nothing like what the C. of England pretends to, for their confirmation in its very nature &s;uppo&s;es bapti&s;m to have gone before. In the in&s;tance of Samaria, Simon the magician was a &s;pectator, and forced to con&s;ent to the demon&s;tration of Chri&s;tianity, given by the miraculous effu&s;ion of the &s;pirit. He had long got his living by &s;orcery, and now avarice led him to covet the power exerci&s;ed by the apo&s;tles. He offers money to purcha&s;e it, but only obtains a cur&s;e. Now, good Dr. can you imagine, that it was only the power of conferring the &s;anc|tifying or &s;upporting influences of the &s;pirit that the magician wanted? Was his pious &s;oul &s;o de&s;irous of conveying &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings to mankind, that he could not re&s;t without the power of doing it? Was it then that he coveted the office of a bi&s;hop? Sure an in&s;pired apo&s;tle, &s;ince that day, commends that cover|ing the be&s;t gifts, and particularly the office in que&s;tion. And if this was all, you cannot but be &s;truck with horror at that &s;entence, <HI>"Thy money peri&s;h with thee!"</HI> Would an apo&s;tle have an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">thematized a good man for coveting to be a bi&s;hop, and being willing to part with &s;ome of his money for the of|fice? It appears to you, and every man with full evidence, that he wanted no &s;uch thing as the power of confirmation&mdash; he did not want to benefit the &s;ouls of men, by conferring the invi&s;ible influences of the preventing &s;pirit, but it was covetou&s;|ne&s;s that led him to wi&s;h for the power of working miracles, and an ability to convey that power, expecting by this means to enrich him&s;elf. And does it not follow with irre&s;i&s;table evi|dence,
<PB N="191" REF="011212_0100_0F862D991D2FEC80">that it was the gift of miracles here conferred by Peter and John? <Q><HI>And when Simon &s;aw that through the laying on of the hands of the apo&s;tles, the Holy Gho&s;t was given.</HI></Q> I en|treat Dr. Chandler, I call upon all the hierarchy of England, to &s;hew us how Simon got gla&s;&s;es &s;ufficiently fine immediately to &s;ee, that the Holy Gho&s;t was conferred upon the Samaritans in his gracious and preventing influence.&mdash;If the&s;e are invi&s;ible to mortal eyes, I hope we &s;hall have leave to conclude, that what the &s;orcerer &s;aw, was that "the gil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of miracles was conferred' by their immediate exertion of it. Is the age of miracles at an end? How infinitely ab&s;urd is it then, ma&s;ter appellant, to bring this in&s;tance, to patronize your confirmati|on! Are Americans &s;o ignorant, as to induce you to hope for ri&s;ing to dignity, by impo&s;ing upon their credulity? Shew us the bi&s;hop ve&s;ted with like power, to confer the gifts of mira|cles, before you appeal to us for the ju&s;tice of your cau&s;e: But with all the te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ptation, do not think that we &s;hall even then turn into Simoniacs, and be willing to purcha&s;e the gift of miracles by the lo&s;s of our religious liberty.</P>
<P>As for Acts 19. which is his &s;econd text; I remark in the fir&s;t place, that the Dr. acknowledges the tran&s;action to be the &s;ame in kind with that in Samaria.&mdash;This conce&s;&s;ion after what has been &s;aid, is enough to &s;hew that it is nothing to the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The world mu&s;t own the ju&s;tice of another remark, i. e. that he has unfairly &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ppre&s;&s;ed the la&s;t clau&s;e of the ver&s;e, which if he had not, he would have refuted him&s;elf. But &s;ince he would not recite it, we will do it for him, and reply no farther.</P>
<P>After they were baptized in the name of the Lord Je&s;us. <Q>And when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Gho&s;t came on them, and they &s;pake with Tongues, and pro|phe&s;ied.</Q></P>
<P>As for the 3d text, where he finds <Q>the doctrine of bapti&s;m and laying on of hands,</Q> mentioned by the apo&s;tles, I have as good a right to apply the laying on of hands here, to that in pre&s;byter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al ordination, as he has to confirmation. And if he can find a &s;olid argument merely in the po&s;ition of the words laying on of hands, after the word bapti&s;m, let it be adduced.</P>
<P>And is this all the foundation, my country men, to build &s;o &s;trange an ordinance upon? It is all that any man has yet laid. And do you not &s;ee, that this argument to catch your con&s;ci|ences, is nothing more than m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re artifice? And &s;hall the want of confirmation lead you to con&s;ent to the importation of &s;piri|tual
<PB N="192" REF="011212_0101_0F862E13630FC8C8">tyranny? Pray open your eyes, and judge for your&s;elves. Doth People in England, who have been confirmed, &s;peak with tongues, and prophe&s;y? Or will the Doctor's bi&s;hop work miracles for you?&mdash;</P>
<P>But confirmation as practi&s;ed in the Church of England, is not only without foundation, but incon&s;i&s;tent and pernicious. Incon&s;i&s;tent&mdash;as, tho' it is confe&s;&s;ed, that the &s;acraments, and particularly bapti&s;m, is a more grand and important ordi|nance; yet the mini&s;ters of bapti&s;m are not allowed to be of &s;uf|ficient dignity to admini&s;ter confirmation.</P>
<P>Pernicious it is, as it leads men to a fal&s;e &s;ecurity in their &s;ins. After the catechumen an&s;wers, that he a&s;&s;ents to the vows made for him in bapti&s;m, the bi&s;hop, without regard to his &s;incerity or in&s;incerity, declares in a &s;olemn addre&s;s to God him&s;elf, that, <Q>he has vouch&s;afed to regenerate the&s;e his &s;ervants, with water and the Holy Gho&s;t; and to give them the forgivene&s;s of all their &s;ins.</Q> Amazing a&s;&s;ertion! and by what authority does he declare, that a particular man's &s;ins are all forgiven? Then laying his hand upon the head of each, he <Q>certifies him by that &s;ign, of God's gracious favour and goodne&s;s to him.</Q> But who has told him, that the&s;e per&s;ons are regenerated and pardoned? Who gives him power to certify to every one, who comes for confirmation, that he is in God's favour? Where does he find this ceremony in the bible? The conduct of mo&s;t, is &s;ufficient to convince the world that the bi&s;hop's declaration is fal&s;e. This is pernicious to Chri&s;tianity it&s;elf, among its ene|mies; but &s;till more &s;o, to the ignorant, unthinking and &s;elf|deceiving part of the world. They are taught to look upon the bi&s;hop as an amba&s;&s;ador from Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and &s;ucce&s;&s;or of the apo&s;tles, who knows the will of God. And when they hear this venerable per&s;on, &s;o &s;olemnly declaring that they are rege|nerated and pardoned, what wonder if they really think them|&s;elves &s;o; and upon the&s;e wretched grounds indulge a confident &s;ecurity of their future happine&s;s?</P>
<P>Americans want no &s;uch pernicious bait to poi&s;on their &s;oul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> They peri&s;h &s;ufficiently without it!</P>

He repre&s;ents the American Churchman as reflecting on a Chri&s;ti|an government, for "depriving a National Church of a right e&s;&s;ential to the Church of CHRIST; whereas he rather com|mends the government, for having depriv'd her of what was only PERHAPS e&s;&s;ential to her well-being, in order to avoid
<PB N="194" REF="011212_0102_0F862E158452B850">what wou'd have probably conduc'd much to her wor&s;e-being.&mdash;The Whig al&s;o, he THINKS, has in like manner reflect|ed on "the kings of the hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover.</HI>" In his 12th. No. indeed the Whig &s;ays, that "the moderation and humani|ty of our pre&s;ent &s;overeign and his predece&s;&s;ors of the hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover,</HI> have of late years re&s;trained, and at pre&s;ent check, High Church fury; but farther, &s;o far as I can find, &s;aith not the A. Whig. So that on the whole, Sq. T. him&s;elf has cer|tainly learned the "&s;curvy trick of lying for" what&mdash;is not "the Truth."</P>
<P>Of all the grievances urg'd by Sq. T. Par. 7th, for redre&s;s of which he claims for the CLERGY an uncontroulable right to petition the King, one only is a grievance peculiar to the Clergy, and, if others bear the expence of their Trips to London, part of that one only, viz. the Ri&s;k of their own dear Fle&s;h and Blood. So that unle&s;s Sq. T. can prove, that they were authoriz'd, not only by their re&s;pective pari&s;hioners, but even by a majority at lea&s;t of America Church men, he can with &s;carce greater pro|priety argue from the &s;uppos'd grievances a right in the Con|vention to petition the King. &amp;c. for a general American Epi&s;|copate, than their right to petition for redre&s;s of the grievances of the Catholic Laity of Canada.</P>
<P>The Clergyman in a neighbouring County, whom Sq. T. &s;o maliciou&s;ly &s;neers at, is indeed a candid, catholic gentleman, and therefore (in things indifferent) can become all things to all men, but is no &s;uch Weather-cock as many I could mention have proved them&s;elves; for, tho' he can ea&s;ily turn his head to any &s;criptural point of the compa&s;s, he has always &s;tood im|moveably fix'd, in &s;pite of frequent zealous tho' gentle puffs, from the mouths of &s;ome of our late blu&s;tering <HI>Epi&s;copalian</HI> Bellowers, and never yet veer'd round to Epi&s;copal Ordination. If Sq. T. indeed believes "that there are ten people of other denominations who are willing and de&s;irous of having bi&s;hops in America, for one Churchman that is again&s;t it," I beg leave to recommend to his &s;erious peru&s;al II. The&s;&s;alonians, ii. chap. 11. ver.</P>
<P>In the honour of the univer&s;ity of Oxford, Sq. T. &s;eems to be more intere&s;ted than I am;&mdash;but if the di&s;&s;enters fa|vour'd the Mea&s;ures of K. James II. it evidently was, becau&s;e arbitrary as they might be, they at lea&s;t tended to knock off the "Fetters" with which, through Epi&s;copal Influence, they them&s;elves were &s;till &s;hackled; and therefore no wonder they afterwards "&s;hifted about" in favour of the Prince of ORANGE, who they flattered them&s;elves wou'd, as he &s;oon after his e&s;ta|bli&s;hment did, grant them the wi&s;hed for toleration.

<P>The pretended letter from the American Whig, is &s;uch a &s;tupid unmeaning thing, that, as it has doubtle&s;s excited blu&s;h|es, for Sq.

<P>I HAVE heard of a Sort of Men who made it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to prove, by Words multiplied for the Purpo&s;e, that <HI>White</HI> is <HI>Black</HI> and <HI>Black</HI> is <HI>White,</HI> as they were paid. The Di&s;po&s;i|tion and Talents of the <HI>American Whig,</HI> are &s;uch, as eminently fit him for this Employment; and was I concerned in a Cau&s;e that needed <HI>&s;uch</HI> Management, of all Per&s;ons upon Earth HE &s;hould be my Advocate, provided I was able, or could afford to <HI>out-pay</HI> my Antagoni&s;t. What &s;urpri&s;ing Dexterity have we al|ready &s;een, in the Cour&s;e of his Papers! And yet Exploits more &s;urpri&s;ing than any he has hitherto performed, are &s;till to be expected, before he retires from the View of the Public. For he has promi&s;ed not to quit the Stage until he has demoli&s;hed
<PB N="196" REF="011212_0103_0F862E16217746A8">every Argument that has been, or can be, produced in Behalf of American Bi&s;hops&mdash;and has &s;hewn that the mo&s;t harm|le&s;s Epi&s;copate in this Country, unle&s;s NEGROES (aye gentle Reader, NEGROES) be the Bi&s;hops, would have a more fatal Tendency, even than the late obnoxious <HI>Stamp-Act.</HI></P>
<P>I now reque&s;t the Reader's Attention to his <HI>Fifteenth</HI> Exhibi|tion made to the Public on <HI>June</HI> 20th, as a curious Specimen of his Abilities in this Way. In this <HI>not-able</HI> Performance he tumbles, he twi&s;ts, and plays the Monkey, with &s;uch Agility, &s;hat every Woman and Child, that beholds him, is ready to cry out, <HI>Did you ever &s;ee &s;o queer a Creature!</HI> His attempt is to undermine and overthrow a Rea&s;on, a&s;&s;igned by Dr. <HI>Chand|ler,</HI> in his Appeal (Page 58), for which the Church of Eng|land in America at this Time, has a peculiar Claim to the At|tention and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of our Superiors in the Mother Country. This Rea&s;on is founded on the late remarkable Di&s;play of Divine Goodne&s;s in Favour of the Briti&s;h Intere&s;ts in the American Co|lonies</P>
<P>In Order to judge properly of this Attempt, it will be nece&s;|&s;ary to place before the Public the Doctor's Argument, in the Words of the <HI>Appeal,</HI> "As America is the Region (&s;ays he) wherein the Divine Goodne&s;s has been more remarkably di&s;|played in Favour of the Briti&s;h Nation; &s;o, America is evi|dently the very Ground, on which &s;ome &s;uitable Monument of religious Gratitude ought to be erected. This &s;hould be of &s;uch a Nature as to be vi&s;ible to the World, and that the Honour of the &s;upreme Ruler of Events may be thereby immediately pro|moted. Now as the Honour of God is mo&s;t directly promoted by public Wor&s;hip&mdash;as that Wor&s;hip mu&s;t be mo&s;t accepta|ble to him wherein the Prai&s;es and Adorations of his Crea|tures are regularly offered him, in the &s;olemn Offices of the pure&s;t and be&s;t Religion&mdash;and as the national Religion mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed be&s;t to an&s;wer the&s;e Characters, in the nati|onal Opinion; it nece&s;&s;arily follows, that the State of the nati|onal Religion here, has a Right, on this Occa&s;ion, to the pecu|liar Attention and Con&s;ideration of tho&s;e, who are entru&s;ted with the Direction of our public Affairs." The Application of this general Rea&s;oning to the Purpo&s;e of an Epi&s;copate the Dr. makes in his next Paragraph. The Church of England in America, is there &s;aid to be in the utmo&s;t Di&s;tre&s;s for want of Bi&s;hops. In this Ca&s;e. and on this Occa&s;ion. <HI>She earne&s;tly re|que&s;ts, and She only reque&s;ts, that proper Remedies may be pro|vided for her pre&s;ent Sufferings&mdash;She</HI> WISHES FOR NO|THING <HI>which &s;hall be thought incon&s;i&s;tent with the Rights and Safety of others. She a&s;ks nothing, but what has been granted to
<PB N="197" REF="011212_0103_0F862E16217746A8">others, without any ill Con&s;equences; and She relies on the com|mon Affection and Ju&s;tice of the Nation, to rai&s;e her to this</HI> EQUALITY. This is the Doctor's Argument, and it appears to me to be very fair, &s;trong and conclu&s;ive.</P>
<P>Let us now &s;ee in what Manner, and by what Arts, the <HI>Ame|rican Whig</HI> endeavours to &s;ubvert it. Has he the Hardine&s;s to deny the Truth of any of the&s;e &s;everal Propo&s;itions? No: the Truth of them is &s;o evident, that a direct Denial of it, he knows would de&s;troy the wretched Remains of his Reputation. does he then candidly acknowledge the Force of the Argu|ment? No: he is too well acquainted with his Trade, and too true to his Cau&s;e, to do this; and yet he &s;eems more than to half-acknowledge it. For of one Propo&s;ition he &s;ays, "to be &s;ure a Denial of it would be a flat Rejection of all Obligations to the Deity'&mdash;and of another, "it will not meet with any Oppo&s;ition," and &s;o forth. Well; but does he not, at lea&s;t quit an Argument that he is unable to confute, and of the Strength of which his own Conce&s;&s;ions imply a Conviction? No: &s;o fair a Conduct is incon&s;i&s;tent with his Character, and would ruin his Plan. In what Manner then does he contrive to carry his Point? The Reader need not be told, that he has <HI>Two</HI> En|gines by which he performs almo&s;t all his Operations, as he knows how to bring them to bear upon any Object; and with <HI>the&s;e</HI> he falls to work in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e. The U&s;e of <HI>one,</HI> is to rai&s;e a Prejudice again&s;t the Argument, by &s;peaking of it contemptuou&s;ly&mdash;and of <HI>the other,</HI> to puzzle and ob&s;cure it, until the Force and Propriety of it, if po&s;&s;ible, are made to di&s;appear.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Place, finding the Argument too &s;olid to give Way to the Impre&s;&s;ions of his Teeth, he mumbles and be&s;la|vers it, in Order to render it odious and offen&s;ive. The Rea|&s;oning and Language of the <HI>Appeal,</HI> on the Subject in Que&s;ti|on, he calls "prie&s;tly Cant and Jargon;" and every one knows that <HI>Cant</HI> and <HI>Jargon</HI> are di&s;agreeable Things, whe|ther proceeding from Prie&s;ts or <HI>Whigs.</HI> The Advocates for A|merican Bi&s;hops he vilifies with the Title of God-makers;" but by the &s;ame Figure their Oppo&s;ers, I mean &s;uch as our <HI>Whig,</HI> may be called <HI>Devil-maker's:</HI> a Sort of Manufactures not more reputable than the other. For if we were to judge of an Ame|rican Bi&s;hop from the Repre&s;entation which is weekly given of him, we &s;hould conclude him to be at lea&s;t as <HI>bad as the Devil.</HI> Nay, the <HI>American Whig,</HI> di&s;covers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rong Symptoms of wi&s;h|ing to in&s;pire a Belief, that a Bi&s;hop in this Country would be <HI>wor&s;e</HI> than the Devil; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> pretends to abhor him to a De|gree, to which, if we may judge from the Immorality of his
<PB N="198" REF="011212_0104_0F862E16E6A97DD0">Writings, he does not abhor the Devil him&s;elf Again; Epi&s;|copacy he pre&s;ents to the Public under the Image of a "devour|ing Mon&s;ter," and the Scheme for the <HI>Settlement</HI> of an Ame|rican Epi&s;copate which is propo&s;ed in the <HI>Appeal,</HI> he tricks off in the Attire of "an <HI>E&s;tabli&s;hment</HI> of &s;piritual Bondage in the Land of religious Liberty." This is a &s;mall <HI>Spicilege</HI> of the Flowers of thy Rhetoric, O <HI>American Whig!</HI></P>
<P>From reviling and be&s;lavering, this extraordinary di&s;putati|ous <HI>Phaenomenon,</HI> proceeds to the Bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>puzzling</HI> and <HI>ob&s;cu|ring.</HI> If "there be (&s;ays he) any Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> or Conclu&s;ion in his (Dr. <HI>Chandler</HI>'s) Argument, it plainly con&s;i&s;ts in this Po&s;ition, that <HI>Epi&s;copacy and not Chri&s;tianity is the national Religion.</HI>" I know no one that &s;uppo&s;es "Epi&s;copacy and not Chri&s;tianity <HI>to be</HI> the nationable Religion" in any other Sen&s;e, than <HI>Non-Epi&s;copacy</HI> or <HI>Anti-Epi&s;copacy,</HI> and not Chri&s;tianity, is the Re|ligion of <HI>Whigs</HI> and Di&s;&s;enters; and all the Argument the <HI>Appeal</HI> implies is, that <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> as taught in Scripture and pre&s;erved by a Church under a Form of Government which is epi&s;copal, is the national Religion. If the Reader will take the Trouble to review the Argument, he will &s;ee its Force, and be in no Danger of being mi&s;led by &s;uch flim&s;y Sophi&s;try.</P>
<P>Indeed the general Force of it, the <HI>American Whig</HI> him&s;elf can|not avoid confe&s;&s;ing, He will allow it to conclude for "e&s;ta|bli&s;hing an <HI>anniver&s;ary Thank&s;giving,</HI> to be celebrated in all the epi&s;copalian and non-epi&s;copalian Churches in the Nation;" but he cannot bear that it &s;hould conclude any Thing in Favour of an Epi&s;copate. As to his <HI>anniver&s;ary Thank&s;giving</HI> I have no Objections to it, as it may be <HI>one</HI> Way of properly expre&s;|&s;ing the national Gratitude; but it would by no Means pre|clude &s;uch <HI>other</HI> Expre&s;&s;ions of it as are <HI>equally</HI> proper. If there is any Weight in the Argument, it mu&s;t operate as effectually in Favour of <HI>all</HI> proper Expre&s;&s;ions of Gratitude, as of any <HI>&s;ingle</HI> Expre&s;&s;ion of it. And particularly, as to the Ca&s;e now in De|bate, the Writer's Scheme of an <HI>anniver&s;ary Thank&s;giving</HI> would but increa&s;e the Ab&s;urdity of refu&s;ing us Bi&s;hops. By a national Appointment of an anniver&s;ary Thank&s;giving, the Na|tion appears in a <HI>religious</HI> Character; but it is peculiarly incon|&s;i&s;tent with <HI>this</HI> Character to let the Cau&s;e of Religion notoriou&s;ly &s;uffer, when there is Power to prevent it.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tians unhappily are divided in Sentiments, and have for|med them&s;elves into different Societies. Amid&s;t this Variety, every Chri&s;tian joins him&s;elf with that Society which he e&s;teems to be mo&s;t perfect, or, in other Words, mo&s;t agreeable to the In|&s;titution of CHRIST. Accordingly every Chri&s;tian, e&s;pecially in a free Country, mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;e&s;t to believe that particular
<PB N="199" REF="011212_0104_0F862E16E6A97DD0">Mode of Chri&s;tianity to be mo&s;t perfect, which he is known to have adopted, the Pre&s;umption being, that upon this Principle he gave it the Preference. In like Manner, whatever Mode or Form of Religion any free Nation has thought fit to adopt and e&s;tabli&s;h, mu&s;t be looked upon as the mo&s;t perfect in the general Opinion of that Nation. For this only Rea&s;on it has been made the national Religion; and tho&s;e who adhere to it, ac|cording to its In&s;titutions, are called the Members of the <HI>Church</HI> of that Nation. Now in the American Colonies there is a va&s;t Body of People, including "Whites, Blacks and Browns," who by Examination or by Education have been led to give the Preference to that particular Mode and Sy&s;tem of Chri&s;tianity, which al&s;o in the Opinion of our Nation (the <HI>Whig</HI> will be plea&s;|ed to under&s;tand that I do not mean the <HI>Scotch</HI> Nation) is the mo&s;t perfect. The&s;e Americans, having received for their Re|ligion the Religion of the Nation; nothing can be plainer, than, that <HI>their</HI> Religion, and the <HI>national</HI> Religion&mdash;<HI>their</HI> Church and the <HI>national</HI> Church, are one and the &s;ame&mdash;and con&s;e|quently, that they are Members of THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND IN AMERICA.</P>
<P>Let us now &s;uppo&s;e an <HI>anniver&s;ary Thank&s;giving</HI> appointed to be religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved throughout the Nation, on the before-mentioned Occa&s;ion, and the Application for an American Epi&s;|copate rejected; how natural would it be to make the following Reflections. The Engli&s;h Nation, in <HI>one</HI> In&s;tance, has ap|peared in the Character of a religious People. The Supreme Ruler of Events they have honoured with their Lips; and &s;uch Honour will be accepted, provided it be paid in Sincerity, and attended with &s;uitable Actions&mdash;without which it is no better than &s;olemn Mockery, and will be con&s;idered as an Abomination. The peculiar Species of Religion which this Nation profe&s;&s;es, has been embraced by innumerable Americans; but they com|plain that with them the Cau&s;e of this Religion deplorably &s;uf|fers, for want of proper Per&s;ons to perform &s;ome of its mo&s;t important Offices. The Relief &s;o greatly wanted, it is in the Power of the Nation to give, without any Inconvenience to it|&s;elf without any Injury to others. Dutiful and earne&s;t Applica|tion has been made to the national Governors in Behalf of this &s;uffering Religion, for their charitable Aid; but they turn a deaf Ear to this Intreaty. Notwith&s;tanding their outward Pro|fe&s;&s;ions, their <HI>&s;olemn Thank&s;giving,</HI> their pretended Zeal for God's Honour; they di&s;cover a Di&s;po&s;ition to <HI>do</HI> nothing in Fa|vour of that Religion, which they e&s;teem to be <HI>be&s;t</HI> fitted to pro|mote his Honour and Service. How ab&s;urd is this Conduct!
<PB N="200" REF="011212_0105_0F862E17A3768978">How glaringly incon&s;i&s;tent is &s;uch a Neglect with &s;uch Profe&s;|&s;ions!</P>
<P>After endeavouring to impo&s;e upon the Public, by &s;ub&s;tituting a "legal E&s;tabli&s;hment" of the Church in America, in the the Room of an <HI>American Epi&s;copate,</HI> as it in&s;tead of, or toge|ther with, the latter, the former had been reque&s;ted, which In|&s;inuation, like many of his A&s;&s;ertions, is "ab&s;olutely, utterly and intirely fal&s;e" and <HI>abberratious;</HI> our <HI>Whig</HI> attempts to di&s;|credit the Argument to which he <HI>is oppo&s;ed,</HI> by &s;aying it <Q>would doubtle&s;s be as conclu&s;ive, in the Mouth of a Mu&s;&s;elman, and in an Addre&s;s to the Grand Signior.</Q> This &s;agacious Ob&s;erva|tion he afterwards &s;agaciou&s;ly repeats and expands, telling us that in Con&s;equence of this Doctrine, <Q>in TURKEY the Law|giver &s;hould advance <HI>Mehometani&s;m;</HI> in FRANCE, SPAIN, and PORTUGAL, <HI>Popery;</HI> in the BRITISH EMPIRE, <HI>Prote&s;tant Epi&s;copacy;</HI> in China, <HI>Idolatry:</HI></Q> And then cries out, <Q>this is certainly mo&s;t excellent Doctrine, from the Pen of a Church of England Divine, and a Doctor too.</Q> In An&s;wer to which I &s;ay, that the contrary to this, namely, that in TURKEY, FRANCE, SPAIN and PORTUGAL, and I may add, in the BRITISH EMPIRE as well as CHINA, Men &s;hould not be al|lowed to act according to the Dictates of their Con&s;ciences, in religious Matters, <HI>is certainly mo&s;t excellent Doctrine, from the Pen of an Advocate for Liberty, and one who thinks to &s;ignalize him&s;elf in its Cau&s;e too!</HI> This Writer, with all his Perver&s;ne&s;s, mu&s;t allow, that it is the Duty of all Men to promote the true Religion.

<P>He makes another Effort again&s;t the Doctor's Argument, by pretending that it will not &s;top, until it has introduced <Q>the whole <HI>Anglican Hierarchy,</HI> with all its Pomp</Q> &amp;c. and "e&s;|tabli&s;hed it over our Heads." But he has offered nothing in Support of this Pretence, but what will equally prove, that I ought not to give a poor Man a Shilling to receive his Nece&s;&s;ity; becau&s;e if I give Way to his Plea &s;o far, I cannot con&s;i&s;tently with hold my Hand, until I have rai&s;ed him to a Level with <HI>Sqire Tickle</HI> him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the de&s;picable Sophi&s;try and Mi&s;repre&s;entation that runs through this Paper of the <HI>American Whig,</HI> we meet with many obnoxious Things, for &s;ome of which even a common School-Boy would de&s;erve the Ca&s;tigation of a WHIP. Thus
<PB N="201" REF="011212_0105_0F862E17A3768978">for In&s;tance, he roundly a&s;&s;erts, that <Q>prelatic Dominion in the Church, and arbitrary Rule in the State, have ever been in&s;eparable Companions.</Q> If by <HI>prelatic Dominion</HI> he means any Thing el&s;e than <HI>epi&s;copal Government,</HI> it is nothing to the Purpo&s;e. Now (not to ramble into the Hi&s;tories of other Nati|ons) there never has been a Time &s;ince the Engli&s;h Nation be|came Chri&s;tian, as almo&s;t every Child knows, in which there has not been <HI>prelatic Dominion,</HI> in this Sen&s;e of the Word:&mdash;excepting between the Year 1641 and 1660, when his beloved <HI>Pre&s;byteriani&s;m,</HI> and its Cou&s;in-German <HI>Independency,</HI> in their Turns, u&s;urped the Dominion of Prelacy.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the AMERICAN WHIG. Of the uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>IF the clergy in the days of ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition, when learning was at a very low ebb, the bible &s;eldom read, and &s;ound rea&s;oning a thing unknown, &s;trenuou&s;ly a&s;&s;erted, and zea|lou&s;ly contended for the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of an uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of dioce&s;an bi&s;hops, from the apo&s;tles, in order to render the go&s;pel mini&s;try valid; this is not &s;o much to be wondered at, and mu&s;t be imputed to the badne&s;s of the times in which they liv'd, and the predominant attachment of Chri|&s;tians in tho&s;e times to religious triffles, and all the vain notions and un&s;criptural opinions of the Popi&s;h hierarchy.</P>
<P>But that Dr. Chandler, a prote&s;tant divine, in the pre&s;ent glorious age of the church, enlightened by all the happy la|bours of the reformers, and the greate&s;t ma&s;ters of rea&s;on that ever exi&s;ted, eminent on the account of their great learning, profound knowledge of &s;cripture, accurate and exten&s;ive acquaint|ance with eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory, free and impartial enquiry af|ter truth, and remarkable candour and charity: That Dr. Chandler (I &s;ay) born and educated in &s;o enlightened an age, &s;hould patronize and plead for an old ab&s;urd, Popi&s;h tenet, long &s;ince refuted and rejected by the able&s;t advocates for truth in his own communion; is a con&s;ideration that mu&s;t &s;urprize and grieve all, who are not under the influence of &s;uper&s;tition&punc; wi&s;h well to the Doctor's character as a divine, and a man of
<PB N="203" REF="011212_0106_0F862E1865DC6DB8">and de&s;ire to promote the Pro&s;perity of the prote&s;tant religion in general, to which this tenet is very unfavourable. For my own part, I really e&s;teem and regard the Dr. and on|ly oppo&s;e &s;ome of his opinions; becau&s;e I think they are un|worthy of him&s;elf, incon&s;i&s;tent with truth, derogatory to the honour of the reformation, and mo&s;t of the prote&s;tant churches, and tending to di&s;unite and rai&s;e ill blood among fellow prote|&s;tants; at a time when the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t and the friends of liberty and mankind, &s;hould unite their utmo&s;t efforts, to promote natural charity and a good under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>But let us hear the Doctor, that we may be convinced of the uncharitablene&s;s of his tenet. After having premi&s;ed that the church of England, holds a di&s;tinction of orders among the clergy, and that &s;he confines the right of ordaining to dioce&s;an bi&s;hops; and after ob&s;erving that none can have authority in the Chri&s;tian church, but tho&s;e who derive it from Chri&s;t, ei|ther mediately or immediately, he &s;ays, <Q>Tho&s;e who receive it mediately mu&s;t derive it from tho&s;e per&s;ons whom Chri&s;t has authoriz'd to convey it; i. e. they mu&s;t receive it by a regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion i. e. of dioce&s;an bi&s;hop.</Q> But may not a per&s;on receive authority in the Chri&s;tian church mediately, without that authority's being received by a regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of dioce&s;ans or pre&s;byters? A worthy and celebrated bi&s;hop of the church of England, &s;uppo&s;es, that in ca&s;e of ab&s;olute ne|ce&s;&s;ity, a number of lay Chri&s;tians, have authority to ordain a man to the work of the mini&s;try, in&s;inuating that after &s;uch or|dination, he will be a lawful and valid mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel. See Burnet's expo&s;ition of the 23d article.</P>
<P>Dr. Chandler, by his regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, means a regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of dioce&s;an bi&s;hops. Yet, why, if an uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, to convey authority in the church, &s;uch a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of pre&s;byters might not confer that authority, as well as bi&s;hops, I pre&s;ume could not ea&s;ily be proved.</P>
<P>If any &s;tre&s;s was to be laid upon an uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of mini&s;ters, the pre&s;byterians are on the &s;ure&s;t &s;ide; becau&s;e the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of pre&s;byters is much more probable than that of dioce&s;an bi&s;hops.</P>
<P>Pre&s;byters in the church of England, may and do perform the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential parts of the mini&s;try; they preach, admini|&s;ter the &s;acrament, receive into communion, excommunicate, ab&s;olve, &amp;c. Now gentle reader! let me a&s;k, is the conferring authority to preach, an higher act, of a higher nature and dig|nity, than all the abovementioned acts united? And can any &s;olid rea&s;on be a&s;&s;igned, why he who performs tho&s;e, may not perform that? Is the conveying any dignity (&s;uppo&s;e the regal)
<PB N="204" REF="011212_0107_0F862E1933D3C6C8">more important than the dignity it&s;elf and the exerci&s;e of it? Rather is it not le&s;s noble? And with the&s;e Sentiments in thy mind, impartial reader! is not the di&s;pute, whether pre&s;byters have a right to ordain pre&s;byters on the &s;ide of the epi&s;copali|ans, a very triffling and &s;illy controver&s;y?</P>
<P>One would imagine, from Dr. Chandler's &s;trenuous con|finement of the right of ordination to a dioce&s;an bi&s;hop, that a dioce&s;an bi&s;hop was able to convey every mini&s;terial accom|pli&s;hment by the impo&s;ition of his hand, and his epi&s;copal be|nediction.</P>
<P>But is this really the ca&s;e! can a bi&s;hop's hand and act, con|vey learning, piety, knowledge, grace, holine&s;s and other re|qui&s;ites to the mini&s;try? Far from it. Tho&s;e ordained by the pre&s;bytery are not in the&s;e re&s;pects inferior to tho&s;e ordained by the bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>Do the bi&s;hops ordain fitter per&s;ons, and more virtuous and holy men to the mini&s;try, than pre&s;byters ordain, or do they take more care to keep bad men out of the mini&s;try? Experi|ence doth not prove this. Are the bi&s;hops better men, more orthodox in the faith, more holy in their lives, and more inde|fatigable in their mini&s;try than the pre&s;byters? I believe not.&mdash;Let it be recorded, to the di&s;honour, the eternal di&s;ho|nour of bi&s;hops, that one of the mo&s;t apo&s;tolic men now in the world, the mo&s;t powerful, eloquent, zealous, indefatigable, &s;ucce&s;sful, devout, practical preacher, that perhaps ever lived, the grand ornament of the church of England, would have had a period put to his u&s;eful and edifying mini&s;try, and po&s;&s;ibly to his precious life too, if bi&s;hops could have treated him as they de&s;ired.&mdash;This &s;ame &s;eraphic, and divine preacher, tho' rejected by his own bi&s;hops, di&s;owned and denied their pulpits by the generality of his epi&s;copal brethren, yet is re|ceived with open arms, by the pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters and people.</P>
<P>The&s;e things may be thought foreign to the argument, but I for my part, mu&s;t declare, that where I find the clergy zea|lous for God's glory and the good of &s;ouls, eager in the en|couragement of holy men, indefatigable in the di&s;charge of their office, exemplary in their lives, &s;ucce&s;sful in gaining &s;ubjects to Chri&s;t, and in making their fellow men wi&s;er and better, &s;trict in their di&s;cipline, cautious in admitting into the mini&s;try, and &s;evere in puni&s;hing the unworthy.</P>
<P>I look upon it, that &s;uch men mu&s;t be lawful mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, and inve&s;ted with authority from him, the above cha|racteri&s;tics I e&s;teem, (and St. Ambro&s;e and Gregory Nazianzen are of my opinion) much more &s;ub&s;tantial proofs of the validi|ty
<PB N="205" REF="011212_0107_0F862E1933D3C6C8">of their mini&s;try, than their ordination by a bi&s;hop in an un|interrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, would be, if they could fully prove it. And with regard to &s;uch proofs as the&s;e, the pre&s;byterian mi|ni&s;ters have as many of them, and tho&s;e as &s;trong as the epi&s;|copalians.</P>
<P>I think the be&s;t &s;eals of a man's mini&s;try, are the &s;ouls that he is in&s;trumental in &s;aving, and in turning from darkne&s;s to light, from &s;in and vice, to virtue and holine&s;s, and from the power of Satan unto God. Let the&s;e be the proofs of one's mini&s;try, and he need not envy any other, the privilege of or|dination by a bi&s;hop; No, nor the dignity and revenues of a bi&s;hoprick it&s;elf.</P>
<P>I believe that Je&s;us Chri&s;t, gives in the pre&s;ent age his appro|bation of a go&s;pel mini&s;ter, and authenticates, and adds a &s;anc|tion to his mini&s;try, by the &s;upernatural influences of the Holy Gho&s;t, which accompanies and renders &s;uch a mini&s;try &s;ucce&s;s|ful in the &s;alvation of men, and this approbation and &s;anction, the non-conformi&s;ts have as abundantly as the epi&s;copalians.</P>
<P>But le&s;t I &s;hould be thought to declaim, and not to argue, I &s;hould now proceed to di&s;cu&s;s more particuliarly the opinion of an uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, of dioce&s;an bi&s;hops, from the apo|&s;tles, and the nece&s;&s;ity of ordination in &s;uch a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve fir&s;t, that if the validity of the Chri&s;tian mini&s;try, was to depend upon &s;uch an unbroken line of bi&s;hops, it is pro|bable that Chri&s;t or his apo&s;tles, would have directed every church to keep in its hands an authentic regi&s;ter of its bi&s;hops, and their legal con&s;ecration. When under the law the high prie&s;t's office was entail'd upon the Aaronical family; God pro|vided that a regi&s;ter, &s;hould be kept of the de&s;cendants of Aa|ron, that &s;o the right to the prie&s;thood might appear. Now to rea&s;on by analogy and <HI>a for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iori,</HI> it is probable, that if a know|ledge of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of mini&s;ters, had been as important and nece&s;&s;ary in the Chri&s;tian church, as it was in the Jewi&s;h, God would have made the &s;ame provi&s;ion for the one, which he made for, the other; yet &s;uch provi&s;ion has not been made, but on the contrary, the apo&s;tle Paul in his epi&s;tle to Titus, cau|tions him, not to give heed to Jewi&s;h fables, and to avoid fool|i&s;h que&s;tions and genealogies; and &s;urely if any thing is a fool|i&s;h que&s;tion, it is this, have I been ordain'd by a bi&s;hop in an uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion? if ever there was any thing like a Jewi&s;h fable, and an endle&s;s and vain genealogy, it is this &s;ame uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; a man may pore all his life time on the records of pa&s;t ages, and yet never come to any &s;atisfaction about every individual and proper link in the unbroken chain.</P>
<P>This argument will be &s;trengthened if we con&s;ider what in|numerable
<PB N="206" REF="011212_0108_0F862E19E2BC8C30">and almo&s;t endle&s;s catalogues of bi&s;hops there mu&s;t have been, if each church had kept a catalogue of its bi&s;hops from the apo&s;tles; and what a tedious, endle&s;s, and next to impo&s;&s;ible ta&s;k it would have been to examine tho&s;e records: the bare mentioning of the thing &s;hews its ab&s;urdity, and its ab&s;urdity proves it could not be con&s;i&s;tent with divine wi&s;dom.&mdash;It was comparatively an ea&s;y matter to pre&s;erve the genealogies of a few families in one nation, for a few centuries under the law: But how difficult would it have been, to have kept a catalogue of all the Chri&s;tian bi&s;hops in every nation, for many centuries under the go&s;pel? the former was kept up by a divine revelation and a &s;upernatural interpo&s;ition; the latter could not be any otherwi&s;e pre&s;erved. But who will pre|tend the nece&s;&s;ity of a divine continual revelation, &s;ince the &s;a|cred canon has been clo&s;ed, or &s;ince the days of the apo&s;tles. There are therefore, no authentic catalogues of all the Chri|&s;tian bi&s;hops &s;ince the apo&s;tles, now extant.</P>
<P>This argument will be farther corroborated, if we con&s;ider how much the apo&s;tles inveigh'd again&s;t the ceremonies, pecu|liarities and minute ob&s;ervances of the Mo&s;aic oeconomy, as un|worthy the &s;crupulous regard and ob&s;ervation of the profe&s;&s;ors of the go&s;pel, who&s;e &s;implicity and freedom, from beggarly elements, they &s;o often celebrated and di&s;play'd. Circum&s;tan|tials in religion are in low e&s;teem with the apo&s;tles. E&s;&s;entials, faith, hope, charity and holine&s;s, are with them of principal con&s;ideration.</P>
<P N="2">2. I ob&s;erve, 2dly that if the uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, in order to render a go&s;pel mini&s;try valid, then there can be no valid mini&s;try in mo&s;t of the prote&s;tant churches; then the Walden&s;es and Albigen&s;es, tho&s;e faithful witne&s;&s;es and illu&s;trious &s;ufferers for the truth, had no lawful mini&s;ters; then the Church of Holland, Geneva and Scotland, the prote&s;tants in France and Germany, and the di&s;&s;enters in England, Ireland and America, are de&s;titute of legal pa&s;tors. But can a tenet, from which &s;uch con&s;equences flow, and which reflects &s;o much di&s;honour on the generality of prote&s;tants, and is &s;o favourable to popery, be rational and true. Charity, virtue and common &s;en&s;e forbid the thought. I dare a&s;&s;ert, that upon Dr. Chandler's principles, the lawfulne&s;s and nece&s;|&s;ity of the reformation cannot be maintained, and therefore, I do not wonder that &s;ome high churchmen declare, "Better be a papi&s;t than a pre&s;byterian."&mdash;Or that they would &s;ooner receive for their pa&s;tor, a Romi&s;h prie&s;t, who had liv'd in er|ror and vice, and been actually guilty of continued fornicati|on,
<PB N="207" REF="011212_0108_0F862E19E2BC8C30">than the mo&s;t orthodox and virtuous, the mo&s;t able and powerful non-epi&s;copal mini&s;ter in the world.</P>
<P N="3">3. I ob&s;erve, that this tenet &s;eems incon&s;i&s;tent with the gra|cious promi&s;e of Chri&s;t, to his church, of being ever pre&s;ent with it, and providing for its perpetual &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; for if its &s;ub&s;i&s;tence depends on this uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; then if the uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion cannot be proved (as we po&s;itively a&s;&s;ert and defy the Dr. to prove the contrary) then neither can the pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t with the church, and its regular &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence be proved. But the church doth &s;ub&s;i&s;t regularly, and Chri&s;t is pre&s;ent with it, in places where dioce&s;an bi&s;hops have no authority; therefore the pre&s;ence of Chir&s;t, the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the church, and the regular admini&s;tration of ordinances, cannot depend on an uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Dr. Chandler a&s;&s;erts, in the appeal, that if it could be made clear, that the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion had been interrupted, it would al&s;o prove farther, that Chri&s;t had neglected to provide for his church, in a ca&s;e &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the being of it. O incredible weakne&s;s and &s;u|per&s;tition! This indeed is playing pu&s;hpin and crambo with a witne&s;s. I thus reply to it, Chri&s;t's church has a being, and he is pre&s;ent with it in places where mini&s;ters are not ordain'd, in virtue of an uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; therefore the uninter|rupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is not e&s;&s;ential to the being of it. I leave it to the candid reader, to determine, who&s;e rea&s;oning is mo&s;t con|clu&s;ive, the Doctor's or mine; he argues from a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, which he cannot prove; I argue from the actual exi&s;tence of the Chri&s;tian church, and Chri&s;t's gracious pre&s;ence with it, in places where no uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is pleaded for, which I can prove, and which I look upon as an unan&s;werable argu|ment, that the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is not e&s;&s;ential to the being of Chri&s;t's church. It is not to be &s;uppos'd, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in whom are hid all the trea&s;ures of wi&s;dom, knowledge and benevolence, would have made the actual exi&s;tence of his church to depend upon a fact that cannot be proved, and concerning which, no man alive can obtain proper &s;atisfaction, or that he would have &s;u&s;pended the validity, of the Chri&s;tian mini&s;try, on a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, at be&s;t uncertain, and which I think I can prove to have been broken.</P>
<P N="4">4. I ob&s;erve, that &s;everal of the mo&s;t eminent bi&s;hops, of the church of England, have di&s;avowed, this uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; which is in my opinion, a very &s;trong argument again&s;t it, as their intere&s;t lay the contrary way. Nothing but the force of truth, and the conviction of their own con&s;cience, could have led them to give up the cau&s;e of an uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of dioce&s;an bi&s;hops. I have already mentioned the
<PB N="208" REF="011212_0109_0F862E1C451B4BF8">opinion of bi&s;hop Burnet, and many other eminent divines of the church of England, who allowed that in the beginning of Chri&s;tianity, bi&s;hops and prie&s;ts were the &s;ame, I &s;hall add to the&s;e, the te&s;timony of bi&s;hop Hoadly, a profe&s;t advocate for dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy. <Q>It is highly ab&s;urd (&s;ays he) to put &s;o important a point as God's favour and eternal happine&s;s upon what no man living can ever be acquainted with to his &s;atisfaction. But it is &s;till more ab&s;urd, to put it upon a matter, the contrary to which appears to be true. This is the ca&s;e here. This regular uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of per|&s;ons, qualify'd and regularly ordained, is a matter impo&s;&s;ible to be proved; nay, the contrary is more than probable upon all hi&s;torical evidence, which we receive in other ca&s;es. (he &s;ays al&s;o) It hath not plea&s;ed God, in his providence, to keep up any proof of the lea&s;t probability or moral po&s;&s;ibility of a regular uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion: But there is a great appearance, and humanly &s;peaking, a certainty to the con|trary; "that this &s;ucce&s;&s;ion hath been often interrupted. See Pre&s;er. p. 78.</Q></P>

<P>THE good Sen&s;e, Candour, and hone&s;t Freedom, which are &s;o con&s;picuous in the following Production, ju&s;tly inti|tle it, tho' written by a Di&s;&s;enter, to a Place among the&s;e Pa|pers.

The Author has &s;hewed the Futility of the American Whig's chief Argument again&s;t an American Epi&s;copate&mdash; an Argument, for which no Di&s;&s;enter who &s;ees into its Con&s;e|quences, will thank him. This worthy Gentleman is appre|hen&s;ive that the Whig's Writings will have a Tendency to bring the Clergy into Contempt. I am totally of another O|pinion. I firmly believe there is not a Man of Sen&s;e or Virtue who will not e&s;teem the Clergy the more for his Abu&s;e. The Whig and his De&s;igns are now too well known to do any Mi&s;|chief that Way. Be&s;ides, he only ecchoes the hackneyed Jargon of Tindal, Collins, and others of the &s;ame Tribe. My ingenious Corre&s;pondent thinks I am reprehen&s;ible for my 'Re|criminations again&s;t Di&s;&s;enters." But I beg he will reflect on the Provocation which I, as a Member of the CHURCH of ENG|LAND, have received. How cruelly, how ungenerou&s;ly has that CHURCH been treated! I began not this Controver&s;y; nor &s;hall I continue it longer than the American Whig is plea&s;ed to make it nece&s;&s;ary. And he may be a&s;&s;ured, that if the Whig &s;hould continue his Attack as long&mdash;nay, thrice the Space that <HI>Troy</HI> &s;tood out again&s;t the <HI>Greeks:</HI> So long will the Whip be held over him, and he cha&s;ti&s;ed for his Mi&s;behaviour. I &s;hall only add, that I have no Controver&s;y with &s;uch Di&s;&s;enters as my Corre&s;pondent, who are willing that others &s;hould enjoy the &s;ame Privileges with them&s;elves; and that I &s;hall be much obliged to this Gentleman, if he will be &s;o kind as to leave his Addre&s;s with my Printer.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The following Piece was written with a View to &s;et the Ar|gument re&s;pecting an American Bi&s;hop, in what I conceive to be its true Point of Light. The Author claims at lea&s;t the Merit of it's having been dictated by Impartiality, and has therefore cho&s;e to rea&s;on upon Principles common both to Churchmen and Di&s;&s;enters. As the Argument is de&s;igned upon the&s;e Principles to &s;hew the pre&s;ent Clamour of his <HI>BRETHREN,</HI> the Di&s;&s;enters to be groundle&s;s, he hopes the <HI>American Whig</HI> will excu&s;e him for emphatically expre&s;&s;ing &s;uch his De&s;ign in the Scriptural Motto prefixed to this Paper. The Author moreover profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf to be a Friend to civil and religious Liberty, in it's mo&s;t exten&s;ive Sen&s;e; and if you, Sir, can bear with his Freedom, and think his Sentiments worthy of Notice, you will by publi&s;hing them, oblige him.</P>
<Q><P>Out of thine own Mouth will I judge thee.</P>
<BIBL><HI>LUKE xix.&mdash;22.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P>THE Di&s;pute concerning the Introduction of an <HI>American Epi&s;copate</HI> has unhappily formed two grand Parties.&mdash; Churchmen who maintain the Cau&s;e on one Hand, and the Di&s;&s;enters who oppo&s;e it on the other, have become &s;o warmed with the Subject, that I am afraid they are both chargeable with having departed from that Delicacy and Politene&s;s which ought to be pre&s;erved in every Debate. The <HI>American Whig</HI> has fre|quently indulged his Pen in ca&s;ting Reproach upon the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> and its Clergy; and tho' I have a better Opinion of his Candour than to &s;uppo&s;e he aimed at every Particular Cler|gymen of that Church, yet his Expre&s;&s;ions are thrown out with an Air and Appearance &s;o general, that every Reader cannot di&s;cern &s;o much Charity as would even &s;helter under its benign Protection, any one of tho&s;e Clergymen, from the malignant Bla&s;ts of his illiberal and indi&s;criminate Cen&s;ures.</P>
<P>It is well known, that the &s;erious and religious Part of a Community, will entertain a Regard and Veneration for their Clergy; and tho&s;e of them who faithfully di&s;charge their im|portant Tru&s;t, are truly worthy of the E&s;teem they generally meet with. Hence it is, that whatever looks like an undi&s;tin|gui&s;hed
<PB N="213" REF="011212_0111_0F862E1E67024C30">Abu&s;e of the Clergy of any particular Church, hardly ever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ails to become intere&s;ting to the Members of it; and this is &s;till more the Ca&s;e when the Abu&s;e is conceived to be levelled at the Church it&s;elf. Nay, whenever a Di&s;pute enters into, or affects our religio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s Concerns, tho' remotely, in its mere Appen|dages, it is apt to engage us with a Degree of Warmth unknown to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s upon other Occa&s;ions. To what Cau&s;e this is to be a&s;|cribed can be of little Importance here to enquire into; 'tis &s;ufficient that there is in human Nature, a Principle that leads to this Di&s;po&s;ition, and it &s;erves in &s;ome Mea&s;ure to account for the Heat with which <HI>this</HI> Controver&s;y has been con|ducted.</P>
<P>Some indeed think, that if the Clergy were brought into Contempt, it would have a very unfavourable Influence upon Religion it&s;elf, and I confe&s;s it is an Opinion that does not ap|pear to be ill founded. For &s;uppo&s;e now that we could once be per&s;uaded to believe, that the <HI>Mi&s;&s;ionaries</HI> &s;ent out by the <HI>Soci|ety for propagating the Go&s;pel,</HI> or in other Words, the CLERGY of the CHURCH of ENGLAND in <HI>America,</HI> were a Sett of de|&s;igning, crafty, lying Fell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, who have no other View in in-introducing a Bi&s;hop, than to aggrandize their own <HI>Church</HI> upon the Ruin of all others; in &s;hort, that they are labouring to become the In&s;truments of Oppre&s;&s;ion to their fellow Chri&s;ti|ans; mu&s;t they not appear to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> cruel and di&s;hone&s;t; and would not &s;uch an Opinion conceived of the Teachers of Chri|&s;tianity, naturally tend to prejudice Mankind again&s;t, or make them indifferent to, the Doctrines and Precepts they incul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ate? This I am confident the <HI>American Whig</HI> would never wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h to &s;ee, becau&s;e I believe him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> be a Friend to Chri&s;tianity. But yet I cannot help fearing that &s;ome of his Papers have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Ten|dency to the&s;e Con&s;equences.</P>
<P>After having thus reproved the <HI>American Whig,</HI> will you Mr. <HI>Tickle,</HI> permit me to treat you with equal Plainne&s;s and Free|dom? Pray, Sir, has not your Paper too much abounded in Recriminations again&s;t Di&s;&s;enters? Has not your Zeal &s;ometimes tran&s;ported you beyond the Bounds of Moderation? I am afraid it has; and &s;o far you mu&s;t al&s;o, acknowledge your&s;elf to be reprehen&s;ible. Pity it is, that more Temper and Decency had not been ob&s;erved on both Sides!</P>
<P>Give me Leave now, Sir, to tell you that I my&s;elf am a <HI>Di&s;|&s;enter,</HI> but upon &s;uch Principles of Catholici&s;m and Benevo|lence as have hitherto, and I hope ever will make me over look the narrow Confines of Party-Spirit and Bigotry; while I view and regard the whole Chri&s;tian Church (however &s;plit into different Denominations) as <HI>one Fold, under one Shepherd.</HI> It
<PB N="214" REF="011212_0112_0F862E1F241DF8C0">is ob&s;ervable in this Di&s;pute, with what Greedine&s;s of Appro|bation each Party commends and applauds whatever is written in its own Favour; while with equal Di&s;gu&s;t and Dete&s;tation they reject the Sentiments offered on the other Side of the Que&s;tion. Thus it is that Truth gets entirely out of Sight; and yields the Prize to blind Prejudice and Party-Zeal.</P>
<P>I have been amazed that upon this Subject, which is thought to affect <HI>American</HI> Liberty, and in which the grand Argument again&s;t an <HI>Epi&s;copate</HI> in <HI>America</HI> is, <Q>that he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be inve&s;ted with the temporal Powers which Bi&s;hops have in <HI>England,</HI></Q> the leading and capital Circum&s;tance of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI>'s not being e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Colonies, &s;hould have been &s;o little attended to.</P>
<P>For my Part, as a Di&s;&s;enter, I hold the Opinion, that there is no &s;uch E&s;tabli&s;hment by Law in the Colonies. This I know to be the general Opinion of Di&s;&s;enters, and indeed of the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Churchmen too: Nor have I Rea&s;on to doubt, that the <HI>American Whig</HI> him&s;elf, is well &s;atisfied as to this Point. It was &s;o clearly proved in a Cour&s;e of Papers publi&s;hed &s;ome Years ago by the <HI>Independent Reflector,</HI> that I have never &s;ince had the lea&s;t Difficulty about it. He &s;hewed, to a Demon&s;tra|tion, that neither the Common nor Statute Law could effect &s;uch E&s;tabli&s;hment; and that in this Country, we might glory in the free and equal Participation of religious Privileges; and in the undi&s;turbed Exerci&s;e of all the &s;acred Rights of Con&s;cience. Happy are the People that are in &s;uch a Ca&s;e! &mdash;May we and our Po&s;terity for ever remain thus &s;ecure in the&s;e our ine&s;timable Rights and Privileges; nor, while the Sun and Moon endure, behold the Standard of eccle&s;ia&s;tical Tyranny erected in this goodly Heritage, this A&s;&s;ylum of Li|berty which we po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>It being once taken for granted, (and &s;urely the <HI>American Whig</HI> will not deny it) that there is no E&s;tabli&s;hment of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> in the Colonies; does it not furni&s;h a &s;olid Principle for determining the pre&s;ent Controver&s;y? May not the Wa&s;te of Argument and Declamation that have been u&s;ed upon this Subject, be drawn, as it were, into one Point, and te&s;ted by the Principle here advanced?&mdash;<HI>Here,</HI> as in a Sanctuary, I think the Di&s;&s;enters may take Refuge, and calm all their Fears. <HI>This</HI> mu&s;t effectually &s;ecure them again&s;t the &s;o much dreadful Chains of Epi&s;copal Dominion: And thus &s;ecured, does it not become their Duty to hu&s;h the Storm they have rai&s;ed; put an End to the Paper War they have de|clared, and leave the <HI>Church</HI> they have attacked, at Peace?
<PB N="215" REF="011212_0112_0F862E1F241DF8C0">The Method of Rea&s;oning by which I &s;atisfy my&s;elf upon the Point is this. If there be no epi&s;copal E&s;tabli&s;hment in the Co|lonies, then the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> here, as having Relation to the State, can no more be known in Law than any of our Di&s;|&s;enting Churches: It mu&s;t be as ab&s;olutely free from all legal Modifications as they are None of the Laws relating to the <HI>Church of England</HI> as a national E&s;tabli&s;hment, can have Refer|ence to that Church where it is not e&s;tabli&s;hed; if then the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> as it exi&s;ts in <HI>America,</HI> is not legally e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, it follows that all the Laws relative to, and founded on that E&s;tabli&s;hment in <HI>England,</HI> when con&s;idered with regard to the Colonies, are without an Object to which they can be directed, and con&s;equently become a meer dead Letter. Whence then is the Force and Operation of tho&s;e Laws to be derived on this Side the Atlantic?</P>
<P>The <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> being thus de&s;titute at pre&s;ent of all legal E&s;tabli&s;hment, neither has or claims any &s;ecular or eccle&s;i|a&s;tical Powers, beyond Di&s;&s;enters. Her Government and Di&s;|cipline are indeed &s;imilar to that of the e&s;tabli&s;hed <HI>Church</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> and hence &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hes her&s;elf by that Name, as the Parent Church out of who&s;e Bo&s;om &s;he emerged.</P>
<P>The Que&s;tion then might be a&s;ked, what it is that can rai&s;e the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> here, out of its pre&s;ent State, into all that Splendour and Dignity which &s;ome Di&s;&s;enters &s;eem to be &s;o much afraid of? In &s;hort, what is it that could give her a legal Exi&s;tence? Would a Bi&s;hop's &s;etting his Foot in this Country do it, or would it not require Acts of our own Legi&s;la|ture to accompli&s;h this <HI>new Creation?</HI> I call it a <HI>Creation,</HI> be|cau&s;e as the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> in Suppo&s;ition of Law, may be &s;aid now <HI>not to be;</HI> &s;o that Power by which it is brought in|to being, mu&s;t be a Power creating it; and I tru&s;t we have no Rea&s;on to fear, that a Legi&s;lative <HI>Fiat</HI> will ever bring this Event to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>Is it not rather a ha&s;ty Conclu&s;ion, to infer that a Bi&s;hop's Pre&s;ence would have &s;uch a magic Force and &s;upernatural Effi|ca&s;y as to rai&s;e the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> from Nonentity? To build up an E&s;tabli&s;hment without Materials, and to &s;et all the various Wheels of her Eccle&s;ia&s;tical and Political Machinery at work? It &s;eems to me dangerous to advance &s;uch a Doctrine; for I believe, if a Bi&s;hop &s;hould come, we &s;hall one and all deny the Principle upon which the Doctrine is founded. At this Rate, &s;hould a Bi&s;hop go into <HI>Holland</HI> or <HI>Geneva,</HI> why might not Epi&s;copacy be e&s;tabli&s;hed there?&mdash;Nay, a few ite|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erant Bi&s;hops, by this &s;trange and my&s;terious Di&s;&s;emination of their Influence, might carry the E&s;tabli&s;hment of the <HI>Church</HI>

<P>Let us then with Chri&s;tian Charity, forbear this Contention.

<HEAD>From Mr. PARKER'S GAZETTE, Oct. 17, 1768. The American Whig, No. XXXII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Continuation of the letter, on the uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE are the true&s;t mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, who mu&s;t re|&s;emble their ble&s;&s;ed ma&s;ter in the temper of their minds and their outward behaviour. As the apo&s;tle a&s;&s;ures us, that the genuine children of Abraham, are not always his natu|ral de&s;cendants; but tho&s;e who imitate his faith; &s;o I believe that tho&s;e are the genuine mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, not meerly, who are ordained by epi&s;copal hands, (for if this were &s;o, the mini|&s;ters of Satan might be the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t) but tho&s;e who are mo&s;t like their lord and ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>I mean not, however, to deny the propriety of go&s;pel mini|&s;ters being ordained to their office by the clergy, becau&s;e the clergy are generally be&s;t capable of judging of a candidate's qualification for the mini&s;try; and &s;olemnly &s;etting him apart to his office, being al&s;o thereunto appointed by Chri&s;t; and therefore, I think it irregular, very irregular, to preach without ordination, or to receive a lay ordination, where an ordination by pre&s;byters is to be obtained.</P>
<P>Yet I do not think, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t, has confin'd the au|thority to ordain to the mini&s;try, intirely to the clergy; I be|lieve he has authorized the laity in ca&s;es of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, to &s;et apart men, or to ordain them to the go&s;pel mini&s;try; and if Dr. Chandler, attends to this &s;entiment, for which I can give good rea&s;on; he will find, that it will fully an&s;wer all his rea|&s;oning,
<PB N="217" REF="011212_0113_0F862E24DDFA35A8">in the 4th page of his Appeal, and whatever el&s;e the epi&s;copalians have advanced on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>But to return to the uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, I think it is very weak in Dr. Chandler, to declare, that "for any one to &s;ay, that &s;uch a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion cannot be proved, (I &s;uppo&s;e he means when nobody can confute the a&s;&s;ertion, as is the ca&s;e here) is not &s;ufficient," But I am &s;ure that a propo&s;ition de&s;titute and incapable of proof, ought not to be made an article of faith, and po&s;itively a&s;&s;erted as an undoubted truth; and I am al&s;o &s;ure, that to a&s;&s;ert, that the uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion cannot be proved, if &s;uch an a&s;&s;ertion cannot be confuted, is altogether &s;ufficient and very much to the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The Dr. &s;ays, it is incumbent on the objectors, to prove, that the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion by which he and his brethren hold, has been broken. But I a&s;k the Doctor's pardon, for differing in judg|ment from him on this point.</P>
<P>As we, the objectors, are &s;atisfy'd with the validity of our ordinations, and have no doubts on the head, with reference to the uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; why &s;hould we perplex our brains in endeavouring to prove it unbroken? But as the Doctor and his Brethren, lay &s;o great a &s;tre&s;s and build the validity of their mini&s;try upon it, I think it highly incumbent upon them, to prove it unbroken. In all other ca&s;es of a &s;imilar nature, &s;uch evidence is required as e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary. When a man pretend a right by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion or de&s;cent, to any e&s;tate, dignity, freehold or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he is obliged to prove, if his right is conte&s;ted, every link of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion or de&s;cent by which he pretends to hold.</P>
<P>For in&s;tance, if G. pretends to be the lawful &s;on of F. the lawful &s;on of E. the lawful &s;on of D the lawful &s;on of C. the lawful &s;on of B. the lawful &s;on of A; and if G. pretends a right to a certain tract of land, as the lawful de&s;cendant of A. in ca&s;e G's right is di&s;puted; it is evident, in order to make it good, he mu&s;t not only prove his own legal de&s;cent from F. but the legal birth of all his intermediate ance&s;tors and their lawful de&s;cent from A. Thus al&s;o Dr. Chandler, upon his own principles, as he founds his right to the Chri&s;tian mini&s;try, upon authority receiv'd from an uninterrupted &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of dioce&s;an bi&s;hops, ought to &s;atisfy us, that every bi&s;h|op in the line of whom he received ordination, was legally con|&s;ecrated</P>
<P>The Doctor &s;ays, it is not &s;ufficient for any one to &s;ay, that &s;uch a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion cannot be proved. But the following in&s;tance will illu&s;trate that point: The pre&s;ent King of France, has a right to his crown, becau&s;e he is the great grand&s;on of Lewis
<PB N="218" REF="011212_0114_0F862E2686025480">XIV. and was at his death the only &s;urviving male in the eld|e&s;t male line: As this was the ca&s;e, his right to the crown was clear, and he was able to prove it by the genealogy of his fa|mily, and every proper evidence; and if any other French Prince, had pretended a right to the crown of France, by vir|tue of the &s;ame lineal de&s;cent, I believe it would have been rec|koned quite &s;ufficient to have told &s;uch an one he could not prove &s;uch a de&s;cent.</P>
<P>If Dr. Chandler has a right to preach the go&s;pel, only be|cau&s;e he was ordained by a bi&s;hop, ordain'd by a bi&s;hop and &s;o on, in an unbroken line up to an apo&s;tle; I am &s;ure he cannot prove &s;uch a right upon &s;uch principles, unle&s;s he can prove at the &s;ame time, the unbroken line; his right to preach in &s;uch a ca&s;e, &s;uppo&s;ing he cannot prove the uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, can be at be&s;t founded only on conjecture; a very improbable conjecture too, as the reader will find by the following con|&s;iderations.</P>
<P>Eu&s;ebius, the mo&s;t ancient eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;torian, from whom &s;ucceeding writers have made their catalogues of bi&s;hops; de|clares, that it was no ea&s;y matter to tell who &s;ucceeded the a|po&s;tles in the government of the churches, excepting &s;uch as may be collected from St. Paul's own words. Mr. Lewis, a clergyman of the church of England, thus expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf, in a Letter to Dr. Kennet, <Q>You know, &s;ir, bi&s;hop Pear&s;on, has &s;hewn that Eu&s;ebius's account is very di&s;turbed and confus'd; St. Peter is &s;et down as the fir&s;t bi&s;hop of Rome, and yet it is a thing very di&s;putable, whether St. Peter ever was at Rome.&mdash;Linus is reckoned as his immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;or; and bi&s;hop Pear&s;on, has &s;hewn that St. Peter died after Li|nus; Cletus, Clement and Anacletus are reckoned next; and yet bi&s;hop Pear&s;on has made it probable at lea&s;t, that Cletus and Anecletus are both the &s;ame per&s;on.</Q></P>
<P>Dupin ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, <Q>according to the common received opinion, to St. Peter &s;ucceeded St. Linus, to St. Linus, A|nacletus or Cletus, and to him St. Clement; this order is ob&s;erved by St. Ireneus, Eu&s;ebius, St. Jerome, and in the ancient catalogues of the Popes; but Optatus, Ru&s;inus, St. Augu&s;tin and &s;ome other Latin authors, &s;ub&s;titute St. Cle|ment immediately to St. Linus, and place Anacletus in the third rank, &s;ome di&s;tingui&s;h Cletus from Anacletus.</Q> Thus we &s;ee the ancients differed about the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, nay, the very exi&s;tence of &s;ome of the fir&s;t bi&s;hops of Rome, the mo&s;t celebra|ted church in the world, and which has taken the mo&s;t pains to pre&s;erve a catalogue of her bi&s;hops.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="011212_0114_0F862E2686025480">
As Dr. Chandler pretends to have received authority in a line of dioce&s;ans from an apo&s;tle; and as I imagine he includes in the fir&s;t part of his line; the bi&s;hop of the church of Rome. I &s;uppo&s;e as he lays a very great and undue &s;tre&s;s upon ancient and eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory; he looks upon St. Peter as the fir&s;t bi&s;hop of Rome, or at lea&s;t the apo&s;tle who con&s;ecrated that fir&s;t bi&s;hop from whom he derives his authority: But I will lay before him, Mon&s;ieur Abbadie's rea&s;oning from God's in|fallible word, which I think fully proves that St. Peter was never at Rome.</P>
<P>The &s;cripture expre&s;ly informs us, that in the divi&s;ion which the apo&s;tles made of the departments of the go&s;pel mini&s;try; St. Peter, with St. James and St. John, had a commi&s;&s;ion to preach J. C. to the Jews, and St. Paul, that of evangelizing to the Gentiles; when they &s;aw (&s;ays Paul, Gal. 2.) that the go&s;pel of the uncircumci&s;ion was committed unto me, as the cir|cumci&s;ion was unto Peter, (for he that wrought effectually in Peter, to the apo&s;tle&s;hip of the circumci&s;ion, the &s;ame was mighty in me towards the Gentiles; and when James, Cephas and John, who &s;eem'd to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellow&s;hip, that we &s;hould go unto the Heathen, and they unto the circumci&s;ion. According to this regulation, St. Paul, immediately preaches the go&s;pel in Greece, in Illyrium, in Italy and at Rome the capital of nations, but he makes no &s;tay in Judea, nor in the neighbouring country; and when he would pa&s;s into Bethinia, he was prevented in his de&s;ign, by the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, who &s;ends him into Macedonia; he indeed travels to Jeru&s;alem, but it was to carry collections for the poor, and not to e&s;tabli&s;h his &s;ee. St. Peter, with St. John and St. James, turns his &s;teps another way. He preaches to his countrymen in Judea and at Babylon, or in the provinces con|tiguous to it, to the Jews of the di&s;per&s;ion; but neither he, nor his colleagues make their appearance i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the we&s;t: St. Paul in his different travels, doth not meet them, he doth not &s;alute them, in his epi&s;tle &s;o full of &s;alutations, addre&s;&s;ed to all &s;orts of per&s;ons: Timothy, Titus, Silas, &amp;c. a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his mini|&s;try, and he doth all in concert with them, even to the placing their names with his at the beginning of his epi&s;tles. But no interview between St. Peter and St. Paul: no letters received or written in common, by tho&s;e two apo&s;tle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> no me&s;&s;age from the one to the other, no corre&s;pondence by word of mouth, or by writing, which are &s;o common, and even &s;o nece&s;&s;ary be|tween colleagues who are not very di&s;tant from each other; the apo&s;tles did not forget their principal calling. St. Paul went to Jeru&s;alem, but not to fix his &s;ee there, for he was the
<PB N="220" REF="011212_0115_0F862E27D6B297B8">apo&s;tle of the Gentiles; and if Peter &s;hould have come to Rome, as &s;ome will have it, it could not be to e&s;tabli&s;h his &s;ee there, for he was the apo&s;tle of the Jews; but the voyage which it is &s;aid Peter made to the we&s;t, has all the air of a fable.</P>
<P N="1">1. The apo&s;tles knew nothing of it, or which amounts to the &s;ame thing, have told us nothing of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. St. Clement, bi&s;hop of Rome, &s;ucce&s;&s;or of St. Peter with|out knowing it, was no doubt ignorant of this voyage, ina&s;much as he makes no mention of it, whil&s;t he de&s;cribes the travels and labour of the apo&s;tles, and particularly the cour&s;es of St. Paul, in the different parts of the world.</P>
<P N="3">3. St. Luke, who leaves St. Paul at Rome, under the reign of Nero, has forgot to tell us, that St. Peter had been in that capital of the world, and that he had been made bi&s;hop of it, from the reign of Claudius.</P>
<P N="4">4. St. Paul arriving at Rome, finds that the &s;ynagogue there, had &s;carce heard any thing &s;aid of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and that they knew nothing with regard to Chri&s;tianity, but that the Chri|&s;tians were every where &s;poken again&s;t. And neverthele&s;s St. Peter had then been a long time among&s;t them, according to the Legendary writers, and of the twenty five years of which his pontificate is made to con&s;i&s;t, two thirds of it, at lea&s;t mu&s;t have been by this time elap&s;ed.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Books of the New-Te&s;tament, be&s;ides &s;aying truth, contain a thou&s;and things which have not an e&s;&s;ential relation to our &s;alvation; and yet upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of the church of Rome, an e&s;&s;ential and fundamental fact is here forgotton, which in placing the corner &s;tone in its place, &s;u&s;tains the divine edifice of religion. Was it then more nece&s;&s;ary, to be inform|ed, that the &s;hip which carried Paul, had for a &s;ign Ca&s;tor and Pollux, than to know that Peter was bi&s;hop of Rome.</P>
<P>I think this rea&s;oning overturns the foundation of popery, and proves that Dr. Chandler and his brethren, have not received their authority from Peter; as they imagine. It al&s;o proves, that one &s;uppo&s;ed chain of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion has been mi&s;taken, and that tho&s;e eccle&s;ia&s;tical writers, on whom &s;o much &s;tre&s;s is laid, have contradicted &s;cripture, and publi&s;hed fal&s;hoods, and there|fore de&s;erve but little credit.</P>
<P>We have &s;een that the links of the chain of Roman bi&s;hops have been mi&s;taken. Let us reflect a little upon what the anci|ents &s;ay of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the church of Alexandria, which was al&s;o a very famous church.</P>
<P>Eutychius, patriarch of Alexandria, relates, that St. Mark in e&s;tabli&s;hing Annanias patriarch of that &s;ame chuch of Alex|andria, e&s;tabli&s;hed with him twelve pre&s;byters, to the end, that
<PB N="221" REF="011212_0115_0F862E27D6B297B8">when the &s;ee &s;hould become vacant, they &s;hould fill it with one of their number, and that the remaining eleven, &s;hould lay their hands upon him, ble&s;s him, and create him patriarch; and &s;hould &s;traightway choo&s;e another man, and e&s;tabli&s;h him pre&s;|byter, in the &s;tead of him who had been made patriarch; and that by this means, the number of twelve &s;hould be always complete. And the author of the que&s;tions upon the Old and New-Te&s;tament, &s;ays, that this cu&s;tom prevail'd throughout all Egypt, whil&s;t it had no bi&s;hop. By this fragment of anci|ent hi&s;tory, we &s;ee that the line of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the Alexandrian church, ran at fir&s;t, through a number of pre&s;byters, and not dioce&s;an bi&s;hops; which di&s;proves Dr. Chandler's notion of the uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The intelligent reader will ob&s;erve, that the patriarch was con&s;ecrated by his eleven fellow pre&s;by|ters, and that they e&s;tabli&s;hed another pre&s;byter in the patri|arch's &s;tead. St Jerome &s;ays, that at Alexandria, &s;ince St. Mark the evangeli&s;t, until the bi&s;hops Hieracles and Denis, the pre&s;byters took always one of their number, whom they plac'd in a more elevated &s;tation, and called him bi&s;hop, and it is very probable, that pre&s;byters ordain'd the fir&s;t bi&s;hops of Gaul.</P>
<P>Dr. Doddridge, in his lectures ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, that conte&s;ted elections, in almo&s;t all con&s;iderable cities, make it very dubious which were the true bi&s;hops and decrees of councils rendering all tho&s;e ordinations null, where any Simoniacal contract was the foundation of them, makes it impo&s;&s;ible to prove, at lea&s;t on the principles of the Romi&s;h church; (and I may add Dr. Chandler's) that there is now upon earth, any one per&s;on who is a legal &s;ucce&s;&s;or of the apo&s;tles.</P>
<P>Mr. Jones, (continues the Dr.) has undertaken to prove at large, that the ordination of our Engli&s;h bi&s;hops, cannot be traced up to the church of Rome, as its original; that in the year 668, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Au&s;tin the monk (who came over in 596) being almo&s;t extinct, by far the greate&s;t part of the bi&s;hops were of Scoti&s;h ordination, by Aidan and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">inan, who came out of the Culdee Mona&s;try of Columbanus, and were no more than pre&s;byters. So that denying the validity of pre&s;byterian ordination, &s;hakes the foundation of the epi&s;copal church of England.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this paper, with the animated and &s;en&s;ible words of Mr. Boy&s;e, on this &s;ubject. Speaking of the nece&s;&s;i|ty of ordination by dioce&s;an bi&s;hops, and of the uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, he &s;ays, We &s;hould not indeed wonder, to hear &s;uch &s;en&s;ele&s;s notions as the&s;e, advanc'd by the furious parti|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ns of the church of Rome, tho' if any thing be capable to

<P>But that pretended prote&s;tants &s;hould lick up the poi&s;onous &s;pittle of tho&s;e popi&s;h writers, and throw it in the face of &s;o many of the mo&s;t eminent teachers, that the reformed churches were ever ble&s;&s;ed with, argues a &s;trange degree of judicial infa|tuation; that they &s;hould allow the validity of the mi&s;&s;ion of the popi&s;h prie&s;ts, who are given up to &s;o manifold and perni|cious delu&s;ions, who are &s;et apart by their ordinations, to ce|lebrate an idolatrous ma&s;s; and that they &s;hould at the &s;ame time deny the validity of the mi&s;&s;ion of all tho&s;e eminent pa|&s;tors of the reformed churches who have been &s;et apart to their office (as Timothy was to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">his) by the laying on of the hands of the pre&s;byters. Nay, tho' they have been ordain'd by &s;uch pa&s;tors of particular churches as were in the &s;tile of the three fir&s;t centuries bi&s;hops; and this after a due and precious trial of their mini&s;terial abilities, and unblameable conver&s;ation. This is &s;uch a &s;train of ignorance and uncharitablene&s;s, that we may well cry out, tell it not in Gath, publi&s;h it not in t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;treets of popi&s;h A&s;kalon, le&s;t the daughters of popery rejoice, le&s;t the &s;ons of Antichri&s;t triumph: And well may they do &s;o, to &s;ee pretended prote&s;tants, thus betray the intere&s;t and honour of the reformation, by ca&s;ting &s;o vile a blot on &s;o great a part of tho&s;e glorious in&s;truments, whom God has employed to ad|vance that ble&s;&s;ed work; and I cannot but approve the ju&s;t cen&s;ure that the learned (and great) Mon&s;ieur Claude, in his defence of the reformation, has pa&s;&s;ed on the patrons of the&s;e notions, in the following remarkable words; "To &s;peak my thoughts freely, it &s;eems to me that this fierce opinion of the ab|&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of epi&s;copacy, that goes &s;o high as to own no church, no call, no mini&s;try, no &s;acraments or &s;alvation in the

This opinion can be look'd upon, no other than the wor&s;t character, a piece of phari&s;ai&s;m all over, that &s;trains at a gnat, and &s;wallows a camel; and I can not avoid having at lea&s;t a contempt of tho&s;e thoughts, and compa&s;&s;ion for their authors.</P>

<P>MY la&s;t Letter contained a Refutation of the weak Sophi&s;t|ry u&s;ed by the <HI>Whig</HI> and his Confederates, with Regard to the Ca&s;e of Ordination.&mdash;A Ca&s;e hard beyond Mea|&s;ure; e&s;pecially if we con&s;ider the unimpeached Loyalty of the Per&s;ons who &s;uffer, and the known Principles of tho&s;e to whom that Suffering may by &s;ome be attributed. The Sufferers have upon all Occa&s;ions, manife&s;ted their Attachment to the Con|&s;titution, with which their own Intere&s;ts are intimately connect|ed, by maintaining as far as lay in their Power, <HI>that</HI> Balance
<PB N="224" REF="011212_0117_0F862E28E8FA1CC0">between the Prerogative of the Crown, and the Liberty of the Subject, which makes the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Government univer&s;ally ad|mired and revered.

<P><Q>I am truly &s;urpri&s;ed, Gentlemen, at the Objection ju&s;t now made to a Mea&s;ure highly rea&s;onable in it&s;elf, and ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite for the CHURCH in <HI>America.</HI> The Colonies in ge|neral, are both by Principle and Intere&s;t dependant on the Mother Country; who&s;e Con&s;titution is the Model of their own, who&s;e Protection has freed them from the Fear of their Enemies; and who&s;e Manufactures are nece&s;&s;ary to their Sub|&s;i&s;tence.&mdash;The&s;e are Ties of an indi&s;&s;oluable Nature, at lea&s;t &s;o long as they are left in the undi&s;turbed Fruition of tho&s;e Rights, which they claim as inherent in them by Na|ture, and &s;ecured by the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution; tho&s;e Rights for which your Ance&s;tors made the noble&s;t Struggles, and which they gloried in delivering down inviolate to Po&s;terity. And tho' there may be &s;ome turbulent Spirits among&s;t them, who were rocked in the Cradle of Sedition, and brought up in Principles &s;ubver&s;ive of Order and Government&punc; yet I tru&s;t the Number is but &s;mall, and am &s;ure their Influence can never be exten&s;ive or la&s;ting.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But let us not be induced by any groundle&s;s Calumnies to do Inju&s;tice to tho&s;e whom we have not the lea&s;t Rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect. The <HI>Churchmen</HI> in <HI>America</HI> are &s;o well per&s;uaded of the Excellency and Moderation of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Government, and &s;o fully &s;en&s;ible of the mutual Advantages accruing from the Dependance of the Colonies on <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> that tho' they may &s;eek Redre&s;s by lawful Mea&s;ures for what they e&s;teem Grievances, yet they would be the la&s;t to frame, or join in any Project to &s;hake off that Dependance, and there|by le&s;&s;en tho&s;e Advantages. Be&s;ides it may be worth our Con&s;ideration whether we ought not to bind them to us by further Motives of Gratitude and Affection; the &s;tronge&s;t Methods to &s;ecure their Fidelity and Attachment.&mdash;I will venture to a&s;&s;ert, Gentlemen, and I a&s;&s;ert it with that Holdne&s;s which Truth never fails of in&s;piring, that <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> has no Rea&s;on to be jealous of the CHURCH, but that the Members thereof will always be an Ob&s;tacle to any Project of disjoining the Colonies from the Mother Country.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And upon what Authority, Gentlemen, are we to harbour this Su&s;picion &s;o injurious to the Members of that Commu|nion which the <HI>greater Part of us by far</HI> join in? Upon the Authority of an <HI>in&s;ignificant and malevolent</HI> SCRIEBLER, whom through Contempt I &s;hould have left unnoticed, had not his Sentiments been e&s;pou&s;ed even in this Hou&s;e. A
<PB N="226" REF="011212_0118_0F862E29B11F68B0"><HI>Scribbler,</HI> who in the Opinion of many, would him&s;elf be an Advocate for &s;uch a Separation; yet audaciou&s;ly charges the CHURCH as inclinable to it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Con&s;ider, Gentlemen, if you refu&s;e the CHURCH this rea|&s;onable Reque&s;t (&s;uppo&s;ing it can con&s;cientiou&s;ly be refu&s;ed) you di&s;pirit the Friends of the Con&s;titution, and afford Mat|ter of Joy to tho&s;e, who&s;e Attachment to it is far from clear, to Fanaticks and Independants. By this Means you may give the latter &s;uch a Sway in the Colonies, and reduce the CHURCH to &s;uch a Situation, as every Friend to <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> mu&s;t &s;hudder at the very Thoughts of.</Q></P>
<P><Q>True Policy, exclu&s;ive of every other Motive, ought to make us carefully provide for the Welfare of the CHURCH in <HI>America.</HI> It's Principles and Con&s;titution are &s;o interwoven with, and adapted to tho&s;e of the State, that together both mu&s;t flouri&s;h, both together fall. If we ca&s;t our Eyes back to that unhappy Period when the great Barriers of the Con|&s;titution were broken down; the Hou&s;e of Lords (if I may u&s;e the Expre&s;&s;ion) politically annihilated; and a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> SOVEREIGN ignominiou&s;ly led to the Block, was not the CHURCH an equal Sufferer, and by the &s;ame nefarious Hands?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Let us not then be &s;wayed by In&s;inuations, which original|ly proceed from the Father of all Lies, and are indu&s;triou&s;ly propagated by Malice and Bigotry&mdash;But let us give our Fellow Subjects and Members of the &s;ame Communion with our&s;elves, tho&s;e Indulgencies which Rea&s;on and Equity de|mand. The Bi&s;hop will be appointed from hence, where his Connections will lie, and his Sub&s;i&s;tence mu&s;t in a great Mea|&s;ure depend upon tho&s;e Funds which are here&mdash;By this Means HE will hardly think of joining with, or encou|raging the Colonies in any Scheme to become independant&mdash; &mdash;And as his influence will probably extend both to the Clergy and Laity of the CHURCH, the proper Dependance of Epi&s;copalians on <HI>Great-Britain</HI> will be better &s;ecured even that at pre&s;ent.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It may &s;eem extraordinary to &s;ome, that I &s;hould have thought this Objection worthy of a &s;erious An&s;wer. But bold and impudent A&s;&s;ertions even when un&s;upported by Plau&s;ibi|lity, are apt to make too deep Impre&s;&s;ions upon the ignorant and unwary&mdash;And tho' I tru&s;t, they would not produce &s;uch Effects within the&s;e Walls, yet the Friends of the CHURCH might have been &s;uppo&s;ed to admit the Charge were
<PB N="227" REF="011212_0118_0F862E29B11F68B0">they not to an&s;wer it.&mdash;Their Defence is built upon the &s;table Rock of Truth; &s;upported by Experience; and may defy all the Storms and Tempe&s;ts, which <HI>Pre&s;byterian|i&s;m</HI> and <HI>Independancy</HI> can rai&s;e, to over-turn it.&mdash;The malicious Sneers, and impotent Cavils of the <HI>American Whig</HI> and his little A&s;&s;ociates, like &s;o many half &s;pent Waves, beat with fruitle&s;s Rage again&s;t the Foot of it, and only &s;erve to demon&s;trate the Solidity of it's Foundation.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In &s;hort, from the Principles entertained by the Members of the CHURCH, and the Conce&s;&s;ions of it's bittere&s;t Enemies, we may conclude, that &s;hould every other Denominations of Chri&s;tians in <HI>America,</HI> con&s;pire to render them&s;elves indepen|dant of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> (which from the known Loyalty and duteous Sentiments of many, we may believe will never be the Ca&s;e) yet even then the Members of the CHURCH would be|have in &s;uch a Manner, that they might be de&s;cribed in the Language of <HI>Milton.</HI></Q></P>

</HEADNOTE>
<HEAD>The NORTH BRITON. [NUMB. LXI.]</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>To the</HI> NORTH BRITON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AGREEABLE to the promi&s;e I made in my la&s;t letter, I &s;hall now proceed to con&s;ider the <HI>religious grievances</HI> of the AMERICANS; which, tho' not carried, as yet, to &s;o great a height as tho&s;e of <HI>a civil nature,</HI> are, neverthele&s;s, as real, and, if allowed to continue, and to operate their full effect, may perhaps become, in time, &s;till more intolerable. What I mean is, the de&s;ign that has been formed to introduce into AMERICA, the <HI>epi&s;copal per&s;ua&s;ion,</HI> as the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion.</P>
<P>This de&s;ign, which is now no &s;ecret, has ju&s;tly excited the ap|prehen&s;ion and indignation of almo&s;t every AMERICAN. They &s;ay, and they &s;ay it truly, that it was in order to free them&s;elves from the tyranny and de&s;poti&s;m of the <HI>epi&s;copal hierarchy,</HI> that their ance&s;tors abandoned their native country, and took refuge in the barren wilds of the we&s;tern continent. And is it to be &s;uppo&s;ed that they will patiently bend their necks to a yoke, which neither they nor their fore-fathers have been able to bear? Is it to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that, after having enjoyed, for &s;o long a time, the ble&s;&s;ings of religious, and con&s;equently, of civil liberty, they will tamely forego them without a &s;ingle &s;trug|gle? Tho&s;e who think &s;o, know not human nature; for every
<PB N="229" REF="011212_0119_0F862E2A75F8A680">one that knows it, mu&s;t be fully &s;atisfied, that there is nothing of which mankind are &s;o very tenacious as of their <HI>religious principles;</HI> and that almo&s;t every attempt to change the&s;e prin|ciples, in oppo&s;ition to the humour of the people, has termi|nated in the de&s;truction of the per&s;on who made it. Witne&s;s the injudicious and ill-timed attempt of King Charles the Fir&s;t, to introduce into Scotland the <HI>epi&s;copal</HI> form of govern|ment. For it may be &s;afely affirmed, that notwith&s;tanding the many rude encroachments which that prince had made upon the <HI>civil</HI> rights of his Engli&s;h and his Scotti&s;h &s;ubjects, neither of the&s;e people would, at lea&s;t for &s;ome time, have ri&s;en in arms, had it not been for the violent &s;teps which his maje&s;ty took to change the <HI>religious</HI> principles of the latter. This was the true &s;ource of the civil wars; and, in the like circum&s;tances, will ever be the &s;ource of civil wars. Nor, indeed, is it at all &s;urpri&s;ing that it &s;hould: for can it be expected, that a people &s;hould change their religion, their manners and their cu&s;toms, in an in&s;tant, and with the &s;ame rapidity with which a prince or his mini&s;try may publi&s;h the ordinance that e&s;tabli&s;hes a new re|ligion.</P>
<P>The truth is, mo&s;t mini&s;ters con&s;ider the people as clay in the hands of the potter, which they think they may mould into any &s;hape they plea&s;e; but I am afraid, that our pre&s;ent mini|&s;ters will find the AMERICANS compo&s;ed of every different mat|ter. I am afraid, that, in&s;tead of clay, they will find them compo&s;ed of &s;teel, that will break before it will bend, and will perhaps cut the hand that &s;hall attempt to bend it.</P>
<P>But, admitting the po&s;&s;ibily of e&s;tabli&s;hing <HI>epi&s;copacy</HI> in A|MERICA, &s;uch a &s;cheme could it actually be executed, ought to be &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed by every friend to his country; as, were it once actually executed, it would certainly be attended with the mo&s;t pernicious con&s;equences. It was, I think, a &s;aying of king James the Fir&s;t, No BISHOP, no KING; and, might I take the freedom of oppo&s;ing a maxim of mine <HI>to that royal chopper of &s;entences,</HI> I would &s;ay, and I believe, with equal truth, No DISSENTER, NO LIBERTY. THE DISSENTRRS are, and ever have been, the very life and &s;oul of <HI>the republican part of our government.</HI> They have often &s;aved it, when upon the brink of de&s;truction; and it is to be hoped, they will &s;till &s;ave it, if ever it &s;hould be again brought to the brink of de&s;truction.</P>
<P>The PURITANS,&mdash;&s;ays a celebrated hi&s;torian <NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hume.</HI></NOTE>, who cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed partial to that republican &s;ect&mdash;the PU|RITANS
<PB N="230" REF="011212_0120_0F862E2B2557AD58">pre&s;erved alive the &s;mall &s;parks of the love of liberty that were to be found in the nation, during the reign of Eliza|beth and of the two fir&s;t princes of the Stuart line. And what|ever ridicule may be thrown upon the Puritans by &s;ome court|&s;y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ophants; I mu&s;t confe&s;s, for my own part, I would rather be a Puritan, attached to law and liberty, than a Church-man, attatched to &s;lavery and de&s;poti&s;m: I would rather be a Puri|tan, who can &s;it quietly under his own vine and his own fig|tree, and none to make him afraid; than a Churchman, who is either employed in ravi&s;hing the vineyards of others, or who, like Naboth, is in danger of having his own vineyard ravi&s;hed from him.</P>
<P>Accu&s;tomed to think freely in religious matters, the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Di&s;&s;enters have ever exerci&s;ed the &s;ame freedom in their political &s;peculations. They plainly perceived the ab&s;urd nature and pernicious tendency of the doctrine of <HI>divine indefea&s;ible heredi|tary right,</HI> and of <HI>pa&s;&s;ive obedience</HI> and <HI>non-re&s;i&s;tance;</HI> and they accordingly rejected it with the utmo&s;t indignation. They bold|ly maintained, that all government was in&s;tituted for the good of the people; that the Salus Populi was the Suprema Lex; that the &s;overeign was only the fir&s;t &s;ervant of the public; that the prince, as well as the &s;ubject, was bound to obey the laws; that the moment the prince violated the laws, the &s;ubject was, at lea&s;t in that in&s;tance, freed from obedience; and that if ever the prince proceeded to &s;uch a length as to violate the laws e&s;&s;ential to the con&s;titution, the &s;ubject was en|tirely freed from his allegiance.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the principles, which the Di&s;&s;enters have ever em|braced, and which they &s;till embrace. The&s;e are the princi|ples, upon which the civil war was begun, and the revolution ef|fected. The&s;e are the principles, upon which the pre&s;ent fa|mily was e&s;tabli&s;hed on the throne, upon which it &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it, and upon which alone it can continue to po&s;&s;e&s;s it. And if ever any mini&s;ter &s;hould be &s;o daringly wicked, as to ad|vi&s;e any prince of that family to violate the&s;e principles, he ought to be puni&s;hed as a traitor to his king and to his country.</P>
<P>But, perhaps, it will be &s;aid, that the&s;e principles have been always embraced, and with as much &s;incerity, by the Epi&s;co|palians, as by the Di&s;&s;enters. If any one &s;hould &s;ay &s;o, the whole Engli&s;h hi&s;tory would give him the lie. Were they em|braced by them in the reign of King James the Fir&s;t, who, when, in the conference of d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vines at Hampton-court, he ex|alted his own prerogative and the prelatical character, was told by the Archbi&s;hop of Cante<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bury, <HI>that undoubtedly his maje&s;ty &s;poke by the &s;pecial a&s;&s;i&s;tance of God's &s;pirit?</HI> Were they embrac|ed
<PB N="231" REF="011212_0120_0F862E2B2557AD58">by them in the reign of King Charles the Fir&s;t, whom they wickedly intoxicated with &s;uch high notions of the royal prero|gative, as precipitated him into mea&s;ures that terminated in his own de&s;truction and in the de&s;truction of the monarchy? Were they embraced by them in the reign of King Charles the Second, to whom they &s;ugge&s;ted the mo&s;t arbitrary councils, and whom they &s;trongly advi&s;ed <HI>to get the doctrine of pa&s;&s;ive obedience enact|ed into a Law;</HI> and who, when that prince made a bold, and unhappily, but too &s;ucce&s;sful an effort to reign without parlia|ments, &s;o vigorou&s;ly a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in his uncon&s;titutional mea|&s;ures, that the hi&s;torian <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>James's hi&s;t.</HI> 8<HI>vo. edit. vol.</HI> viii. <HI>p.</HI> 152.</NOTE> above quoted, expre&s;sly &s;ays; the <Q>clergy e&s;pecially were bu&s;y in this great revolution; and being moved, partly by their own fears, partly by the in&s;i|nuations of the court, they repre&s;ented all their antagoni&s;ts as &s;ectaries and republicans, and rejoiced in e&s;caping all tho&s;e perils, which they believed to have been hanging over them. <HI>Principles, the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite to civil liberty, were every where enforced from the pulpit,</HI> and adopted in numerous addre&s;&s;es; where the king was flattered in his pre&s;ent mea&s;ures, and <HI>con|gratulated on his e&s;cape from parliaments.</HI> Could words have been depended on, the nation appeard to be running fa&s;t in|to voluntary &s;ervitude, and &s;eemed even ambitious of re&s;ign|ing into the king's hands, all the privileges, tran&s;mitted to them, through &s;o many ages, by their gallant an|ce&s;tors.</Q></P>
<P>And though they made &s;ome oppo&s;ition to the violent mea|&s;ures of King James the Second, yet was it chiefly becau&s;e their own order was attacked; for, had that prince been con|tented with de&s;troying only the civil liberties of the nation, without endeavouring to undermine its religion, 'tis more than probable that he might have carried his point, at lea&s;t for any interruption he was likely to have met with from the e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy.</P>
<P>True it is, they concurred in the revolution; but with what &s;incerity, the great number of them who refu&s;ed to take the oaths to the new government, and the endle&s;s plots and con|&s;piracies they hatched again&s;t it, &s;ufficiently declare.</P>
<P>Let it not, however, be imagined, that I mean to impute the above principles and practices to the whole body of the Epi&s;copal Clergy. God fordid! I know there are &s;ome of the Epi&s;copal Clergy, who are as &s;taunch friends to the liberty of the &s;ubject, as any Di&s;&s;enter in the kingdom; witne&s;s the wor|thy <HI>author of the Confe&s;&s;ional,</HI> and &s;everal others. I only mean
<PB N="232" REF="011212_0121_0F862E2BE87FC858">impute them to the high flying, Jacobite clergy, and to their deluded followers among the laity, who never were, and, I believe, never will be thoroughly reconciled to <HI>our free go|vernment;</HI> and if ever they &s;hould be reconciled to <HI>our govern|ment,</HI> I &s;hall begin, I mu&s;t own, to entertain a &s;u&s;picion, that <HI>our government it no longer free.</HI></P>
<P>But, though I mean not to impute the above principles and practices to the whole body of the Epi&s;copal Clergy, I may yet, I am per&s;uaded, take upon me to a&s;&s;ert, that the <HI>epi&s;copal form of church government</HI> is much better adapted, than that of the <HI>pre&s;byterians</HI> or of <HI>any other &s;ect,</HI> to an <HI>ab&s;olute monarchy;</HI> and for the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion I appeal to the &s;entiments of the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible writers who have treated of politics. The di&s;tance between the proud prelate and the poor curate is almo&s;t as great, as that between the grand monarch and the meane&s;t of his menial &s;ervants. The truth is, the &s;pirit of &s;ubordination that prevails in the <HI>epi&s;copal form of church government,</HI> is ad|mirably calculated to pre&s;erve <HI>order,</HI> or rather <HI>&s;lavery,</HI> in civil &s;ociety; for is it to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that a man, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of about ten pounds a year, will dare to di&s;obey the orders of one, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, perhaps, of as many thou&s;ands?</P>
<P>'Tis an old and ju&s;t ob&s;ervation, that <HI>&s;uper&s;tition is an enemy to civil liberty,</HI> and <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m a friend to it.</HI>&mdash;But it is well known, that the Church of England partakes con&s;idera|bly of the <HI>&s;uper&s;titious character;</HI> and that all the Di&s;&s;enters are, more or le&s;s, remarkable for <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m.</HI> That this is the natural tendency of &s;uper&s;tition, will be evident to any one who con&s;iders the &s;ituation of France, of Spain, or of any o|ther <HI>Roman catholic country,</HI> where &s;uper&s;tition prevails in its full force, and where the poor people are held in &s;uch a &s;la|vi&s;h &s;ubjection by their &s;piritual and temporal rulers, that they are almo&s;t looked upon as beings of an inferior &s;pecies. It is commonly reported of a <HI>French bi&s;hop,</HI> who was a Man of Quality, as mo&s;t of the <HI>French bi&s;hops</HI> are, that, thinking it beneath his dignity to addre&s;s his flock in the u&s;ual &s;tyle, <HI>Mes cheres freres,</HI> or <HI>Dearly beloved brethren,</HI> he began his &s;ermon thus; <HI>Canaille Chretien, eco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tez la parole de Dieu; Ye Chri&s;tian Scoundrels, li&s;ten to the word of God!</HI> Such were the ideas of a due <HI>&s;ubordination,</HI> with which <HI>&s;uper&s;tition</HI> in&s;pired this right reve|rend and honourable prelate!</P>
<P>But not only is the <HI>epi&s;copal form of church government an enemy to liberty</HI> and <HI>a friend to &s;lavery,</HI> by the &s;trong mixture of <HI>&s;uper&s;tition</HI> which it contains, and by the infinite <HI>di&s;tinction</HI> it makes among the different members, of which it is compo&s;ed: it is likewi&s;e &s;o, by the great member of u&s;ele&s;s prie&s;ts with which it is encumbered, by the immen&s;e wealth po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the&s;e
<PB N="233" REF="011212_0121_0F862E2BE87FC858">prie&s;ts, and by the unequal di&s;tribution of that wealth among the &s;everal per&s;ons belonging to the prie&s;thood.</P>
<P>The <HI>clergy</HI> of Scotland, if I am rightly informed, do not amount to one thou&s;and. The <HI>clergy</HI> of England, I believe, fall not greatly &s;hort of twelve thou&s;and.&mdash;So that, &s;up|po&s;ing the <HI>clergy</HI> to bear the &s;ame proportion to the <HI>laity</HI> in both the&s;e kingdoms, England &s;hould contain twelve times as many inhabitants as Scotland. But England, according to the highe&s;t computation, does not contain above three, or, at mo&s;t, four times as many inhabitants as Scotland; &s;o that, making allowance for the greater number of people in the for|mer than in the latter, for every <HI>clergyman</HI> in Scotland there are at lea&s;t three, if not four, in England. And, as the number of <HI>clergy</HI> in England, is &s;o much larger than in Scotland, their revenues, it is well known, are proportionably large. The whole annual revenue of the <HI>Scoti&s;h clergy</HI> does not exceed 80,000 pounds; a &s;um hardly equal to what is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the <HI>bi&s;hops alone,</HI> and perhaps not one tenth of what is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the whole body of the <HI>Engli&s;h clergy.</HI> And as the annual reve|nue of the <HI>Engli&s;h clergy</HI> is &s;o much greater than that of the <HI>Scotch,</HI> it is divided, it is certain, among the different members in a much more unequal and di&s;proportionate manner. Few <HI>Scoti&s;h clergymen</HI> have le&s;s than fifty, and few more than a hun|dred pounds a year. But, as I hinted above, &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h clergymen</HI> have ten thou&s;and, and &s;ome little more than ten pounds a year. Such an infinite difference is there, in the number of clergymen, in the amount of their revenue, and in the di&s;tribution of that revenue, between the <HI>epi&s;copal</HI> and the <HI>pre&s;byterian</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hments; and &s;o much more favourable is the former, than the latter, to an ab&s;olute and pure monarchy! But as the Engli&s;h government never was, is not now, and I hope never will be an ab&s;olute and pure monarchy, &s;o I pray I may never be &s;o unhappy as to live to &s;ee the time when the <HI>epi&s;copal per&s;ua&s;ion</HI> &s;hall be extended over the whole Briti&s;h do|minions; for, if ever that time &s;hould unfortunately arrive, I will take upon me to affirm, that our liberties are, from that moment, irrecoverably ruined.</P>
<P>I will, indeed, admit, that the <HI>epi&s;copal</HI> religion is the chief &s;upport of the <HI>monarchical</HI> part of our government; and &s;o far I wi&s;h it may always be pre&s;erved in its pre&s;ent condition. But, as I never de&s;ire to &s;ee the <HI>monarchical</HI> part of our government enlarged, &s;o neither do I de&s;ire to &s;ee the <HI>epi&s;copal</HI> religion ex|tended beyond its pre&s;ent bounds. Our government, as I ob|&s;erved in my la&s;t letter, partakes more of a <HI>republic</HI> than of a <HI>monarchy.</HI> The <HI>epi&s;copalians</HI> are the chief &s;upport of the <HI>mo|narchical</HI>
<PB N="234" REF="011212_0122_0F862E2CAC066A90">part of it; the <HI>di&s;&s;enters,</HI> of the republican; and therefore I wi&s;h, that there may be always a greater number of <HI>di&s;&s;enters</HI> than <HI>epi&s;copalians</HI> in the Briti&s;h dominions. The <HI>crown,</HI> God knows! does not at pre&s;ent &s;tand in need of any additional a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the <HI>hierarchy.</HI> It is daily receiving fre&s;h acce&s;&s;ions of &s;trength from a variety of other quarters; which, I am afraid, it is not &s;o ea&s;y to block up; and which yet, if they are not blocked up, will in time confer upon it &s;uch an exorbitant degree of power, as will enable it to overturn the liberties of the nation.</P>
<P>Let the mini&s;try, therefore, drop their ill judged &s;cheme of e&s;tabli&s;hing <HI>epi&s;copacy</HI> in America; and let the <HI>bi&s;hop</HI> of <HI>Lon|don,</HI> who has lately been appointed one of the L&mdash;of Tr&mdash;e and Pl&mdash;ns, direct his attention rather to <HI>temporal</HI> than to <HI>&s;piritual</HI> objects. Nor need he be afraid of being put out of countenance by the &s;uperior abilities of his fellow-commi&s;&s;ioners; for, however ignorant he may be of the nature of commerce, I will venture to a&s;&s;ure him, that he can|not well be more ignorant than his colleagues.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir ISAAC,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I beg 10,000 pardons for procuring you the long threatened cuff from the huge fi&s;t of that Herculean brui&s;er Plead well's Friend. Tho' you felt not the blow, I mu&s;t make you &s;a|tisfaction for the in&s;ult, by a vindictive kick on the brawny po|&s;teriors of this Broughtonian champion. Sq. T's extravagant encomiums on him, while they do him&s;elf no honour, are very ill-judg'd tokens of "re&s;pect;" for, it being almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to cau&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ting prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the minds of competent judges, previous commendation &s;eldom fails of introducing even &s;ome|thing more than a di&s;appointment. Both Sq. T. and P's F. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ready to tear their beards (if any they have) out of vex|ation;&mdash;poor rogues! I pity them, but I mu&s;t kick them too.</P>
<P>P's F. "fears it may be thought too low a &s;toop" for him "to take any notice" of you, Sir I&s;aac. He may make him|&s;elf very ea&s;y on that &s;core; but let him remember <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat the towering GOLIAH, in &s;pite of all the contemptuous airs he gave him&s;elf, was forc'd to &s;toop lower &s;till, and even &s;ubmit to be more than kick'd,&mdash;to be trampled upon, by lit|tle David.</P>
<P>I had &s;aid, that to &s;uch an ignorant fellow as I was, nothing &s;eemed, at lea&s;t &s;o well, to admit of a reply as an untruth; but that Mr. P. &s;corning &s;uch ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s, appear'd ambi|tious
<PB N="236" REF="011212_0123_0F862E2D659A7700">of the honour of replying to real truths, and de&s;irous of trying his abilities at defending the contrary:&mdash;but P's F. &s;ays <Q>you apologize for your ignorance, and wonder that Mr. P. &s;hould decline replying to an untruth, and be ambitious of entering upon the defence of the contrary.</Q>&mdash;I will ju&s;t &s;ugge&s;t, that I wonder'd not, (nor had I rea&s;on) at Mr. P.&mdash; That an Irony is no apology; and that the contraries of truth and untruth are very different things: and then from his mi&s;|repre&s;entations and blunders, let your readers judge for them|&s;elves of the "goodne&s;s of heart and abilities of Pleadwell's Friend. "Lawyers," he &s;ays, "in their pleadings are not bound down to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> very nice rules of compo&s;ition." Suppo&s;ing this to be true, what then?&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y remark concern'd not compo&s;ition but &s;entiment, and if lawyers are not "bound down to" nice rea&s;onings and even expre&s;&s;ions at lea&s;t intelligi|ble, FROM ALL OF THE PROFESSION&mdash;DELIVER ME! &s;ay I. If the pa&s;&s;age in que&s;tion was a mere "Imperfection in &s;tyle," a direct acknowledgment had been much more decent than an oblique reflection on foren&s;ic practice; but if you, Sir I&s;aac, make it a point to "pa&s;s over" none &s;uch,&mdash;you have an hard ta&s;k, an <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">an</HI> &s;table indeed.</P>
<P>But the ob&s;ervation be very wi&s;ely makes, par. 3d. viz. that "lawyers are much &s;hackled with forms," is more true, but to me &s;eems as impertinent as it is incon&s;i&s;tent with the other. I know imperfection as to form, and 20 other Things, expo&s;e a plea to a demurrer; but I can't find that untruth as to facts is ever alledg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d as the cau&s;e of in&s;ufficiency.&mdash;But perhaps I'm mi&s;taken, for (as I &s;aid before, I am no lawyer, tho' eno' of one perhaps to di&s;cover, that P's F. is neither more nor le&s;s, than an attorney's clerk, and probably the identical farmer Pleadwell him&s;elf</P>
<P>In my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> letter I did not, as (I da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;ay) you, Sir I&s;aac, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of your kicks ever did&punc; "a&s;pire to literary fame." Kicking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> paltry whippe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> would naturally be done under cover, as being, however u&s;eful to the public, rather di&s;reputable to a decent private character; but, if P. did indeed aim (as his friend &s;ugge&s;ts) at literary fame, I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, he was not in the read, and dare promi&s;e, that, tho' he, his friend, and even Sq. T&punc; him&s;elf, &s;hould in per&s;on avow their re&s;pective performances in pre&s;ence of 500 old women, not one of them all would pre&s;ent either of them with a &s;ingle &s;prig of laurel.</P>

He may ironize and &s;yllogize as long as he plea&s;es; but 'twill after all be pretty clear&punc; that by that "unlucky word" P. has blabb'd out, what he would copy an armful of <HI>juridical formulae</HI> to get in again: for he as well as William Pere Williams was pleading

Thus much for canonading.</P>

His way of "turning the tables" is &s;o|phi&s;tical;&mdash;we never &s;aid, "Church-men &s;hould not have a &s;ingle clergyman ordained, except he went to England;" much le&s;s that "they &s;hould for ever be obliged to go there: To bring the matter to a fair i&s;&s;ue, let him (with all his abili|ties and goodne&s;s of heart) imagine him&s;elf a di&s;&s;enter, Par. 6th He confe&s;&s;es him&s;elf no match for you (i. e. me) at giving de|licate epithets &amp;c;&mdash;he wrongs him&s;elf; but the public will give him the di&s;avowed character due to &s;uch &s;ingular mode&s;ty.</P>
<P>Hitherto I've us'd this piddler as a play thing; but his 7th par, half excites my indignation, he repre&s;ents me as in effect &s;aying, that the right of epi&s;copacy mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be as human in America as in England; when I only inferred, it could not be more divine.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH the Church in America has ever &s;tudied a&s;&s;idu|ou&s;ly to promote Concord, and to conciliate Peace with every Denomination; yet, a re&s;tle&s;s Party, di&s;contented with the free&s;t Enjoyment of their religious Privileges have been con|tinually waring again&s;t her, and con&s;tantly increa&s;ing in their Virulence, and Animo&s;ity. From the Heighths to which they have already ri&s;en, every Friend to Liberty and Ju&s;tice, may judge what the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church mu&s;t expect from an <HI>Increa&s;e</HI> of their Power.</P>
<P>So gigantic at this Day are their Strides, that for a candid Appeal to the Public in its Behalf, his Maje&s;ty's and the nati|onal Religion, has been &s;tigmatized in the mo&s;t injurious Man|ner; and a Bi&s;hop under the Re&s;trictions propo&s;ed, threatened with a Reception &s;imilar to that of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of a late Act. Whether &s;uch a Conduct is agreeable to their Profe&s;&s;ions of a Love to religious Liberty, and the Intere&s;ts of their Country, I leave to their mo&s;t in&s;atuated Votaries to determine. Every good Man will endeavour to calm as much as po&s;&s;ible the Spirit of Party; but the&s;e Men, fond of fi&s;hing in troubled Waters, have ever made it their Study to promote Di&s;&s;entions. For this Rea&s;on, in this Country where ever the Name were in ge|neral unheard of, they would diffu&s;e the Principles of Oppo&s;i|tion
<PB N="239" REF="011212_0124_0F862E2E2469E640">among us, by the Party Di&s;tinctions of Whig and Tory; and kindle Di&s;cord in the Church by a Divi&s;ion into High and low. To An&s;wer the la&s;t mentioned End, the American Whig has affected the Gui&s;e and Appearance of a Churchman,&mdash;that he may &s;tab us the more &s;en&s;ibly. But I am confident that his Di&s;gui&s;e is &s;o thin, that he &s;tands expos'd to the Scorn of every ju&s;t Man, and the Contempt of the weake&s;t. However as Poi|&s;on is de&s;tructive by whatever Hand admini&s;tred, I &s;hall make &s;uch Ob&s;ervations on his Attempt in the 25th No. of the Whig, as I flatter my&s;elf will be a &s;ufficient Antidote, and point out the Author's native Hideou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>The two fir&s;t Paragraphs of this Epi&s;tle are taken up with abu&s;ive Reflections on the Briti&s;h Hierarchy, without Advancing one Proof of his foul-mouth'd A&s;&s;ertions. They are thick &s;own with Reflections on the "Pride, Ambition, and Tyranny of Prie&s;ts;" and the evident Intent of them appears to be, to excite an Odium again&s;t Prelacy. Now, tho' &s;uch an Epi&s;copate as he combats with was never de&s;ired&mdash;tho' the <HI>onus probandi</HI> lies on him, and the&s;e Affirmations might float down the Tide of Oblivion with the re&s;t of tho&s;e light, un&s;ub&s;tantial, unprov'd A&s;&s;everations which he has thrown out, and which the Reader is no more obliged to &s;wallow than the Deci&s;ions of the Pope: Yet &s;ince by their being &s;o often repeated in &s;o rancorous a Manner, they may tend to excite in weak Minds a Di&s;re&s;pect for the pre&s;ent Con&s;titution of Government; I &s;hall offer a few Particulars worthy the Con&s;ideration of every Well-wi&s;her to his Country.</P>
<P>Since the Legi&s;lature, for the Pre&s;ervation of true Religion, has wi&s;ely e&s;tabli&s;hed a Church, which differs only from other Denominations, for the mo&s;t Part, in mere external Modes, and her external Modes are deemed mo&s;t con&s;onant to the Principles of Government, every true patriot will either promote &s;uch an E&s;tabli&s;hment, or at lea&s;t not oppo&s;e it.</P>
<P>Again,&mdash;If the Legi&s;lature, for the Encouragement and Support of this Church, has decreed to tho&s;e whom it judges mo&s;t capacitated for her Service by their Piety, Learning, or A&s;&s;iduity, certain Immunities and Honours, every Friend to Re|ligion and Society mu&s;t approve of the Procedure.</P>
<P>Since the&s;e eccle&s;ia&s;tical Rights and Immunities, are &s;o in|terwoven with the civil Polity, and have been &s;o moulded and fa&s;hioned with the Con&s;titution of the State, that the Exter|mination of Prelacy, will either de&s;troy or very much endan|ger the Common-Wealth; every wi&s;e Politician will &s;upport the one, if only to pre&s;erve the other.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="011212_0125_0F862E3069AE6518">Further,&mdash;&s;ince the pre&s;ent Bi&s;hops make no undue u&s;e of their Powers, but mildly exerci&s;e them to charitable Pur|po&s;es,&mdash;to the Increa&s;e of Prote&s;tanti&s;m and Learning, to the Relieving the Poor, the Propagation of the Go&s;pel, and the Diminution of Vice and Ignorance; it follows, that who|&s;oever by oppugning and maligning them, endeavours to dimi|ni&s;h their U&s;efulne&s;s, proves him&s;elf an Enemy to the Intere&s;ts of Religion and his Country, and acts contrary to the Charac|ter of a Prote&s;tant and true Briton.</P>
<P>Our pious Fore-fathers, led by the Example of all former Ages, con&s;idering their Obligations to Gratitude greater than tho&s;e of any other Nation; remembring the Promi&s;e our LORD and SAVIOUR has made unto them, who &s;hould confer the &s;malle&s;t Favour on his Di&s;ciples; reflecting how earne&s;t the A|po&s;tle is in arguing, That if the Mini&s;ters of the Law were &s;o amply provided for, le&s;s Care ought not to be had of tho&s;e, who under the Go&s;pel po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed corre&s;pondent Situations in the Church; knowing how expedient and nece&s;&s;ary it was that tho&s;e Rulers, who are e&s;pecially commanded to be given to Ho&s;pitality, and to provoke all others by Examples of Charity, &s;hould have Means by which they might effectually perform the&s;e Duties.&mdash;Con&s;idering the&s;e Things, they liberally &s;et apart Livings, Lands and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, for the U&s;e of the Church; and tho' the&s;e have been invaded by the avaricious Hand of Per&s;ecution, and mangled by the &s;acrilegious Jaws of Rapine and Rebellion, yet a Remnant continues to this Day; &mdash;and will continue &s;o long as Ju&s;tice, Learning, and true Religion &s;urvive!</P>
<P>The Practice of &s;trengthening the Reins of Government, by a Reverence paid to the Officers employed in the Service of Re|ligion, &s;eems to be founded on a Dictate of natural Rea&s;on, a|dopted by all Nations, and authorized by the Example of God him&s;elf, the divine Legi&s;lator of the Jews. So weak is human Nature, that it looks upon Poverty (however unju&s;tly) with Contempt. To avoid this, &s;ince a Reverence for Governors is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to the Pre&s;ervation of Order, prudent Le|gi&s;latures have annexed Degrees of Dignity and Honour to e|very public Office, according to its U&s;efulne&s;s. As therefore the Officers appointed for the Promotion of Religion, are the fir&s;t in Expediency, it is wi&s;e to encourage them with adequate Supports.&mdash;Again, it is agreeable to &s;ound Policy, to en|gage as many Per&s;ons of Learning and Abilities in the Service of any Society as po&s;&s;ible: For Rea&s;on and Experience pro|nounce, that without the Aids and Ornaments of Learning, no
<PB N="241" REF="011212_0125_0F862E3069AE6518">Society will either flouri&s;h or be much re&s;pected. Now it is evident that the wi&s;e&s;t Men will generally want the Incitements of Honour and Fortune, as Rewards for their Labours, and Spurs to their Diligence. Wi&s;e therefore is it in any Nation to &s;timulate Men of Learning to tho&s;e Offices which are e&s;&s;ential to its well-being, by proper Rewards.&mdash;Further, Want begets Servility, which is incon&s;i&s;tent with Superintendency. Men likewi&s;e, in &s;uch a Situation, are more &s;ubject to the Becks of Power, and more liable to Bribery and Corruption. The Poverty al&s;o of &s;ome of the Clergy, has, in the Opinion of the wi&s;e&s;t Politicians, occa&s;ioned mo&s;t of that Neglect and De&s;pite with which the Order it&s;elf is too frequently treated, to the great Prejudice and Ob&s;truction of Chri&s;tianity. Much more ju&s;t Cau&s;e of Declamation, are tho&s;e Pen&s;ions which are &s;quandered on the Idle, the Vicious, and Profane, than that Provi&s;ion for the decent Support of Men, who are the Sup|porters, (under God) of Prote&s;tanti&s;m; who are Ornaments of their Country, and the firme&s;t Defenders of every Species of Liberty.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, to doubt of the Propriety of their retaining their legal Incomes, is to call in que&s;tion the Knowledge of tho&s;e Men, who rear'd the Fabric of our happy Con&s;titution, and &s;o combined its Powers, that to take them away, would render the Scale of Authority, &s;o well-balanced, unequal. Upon the Whole, I doubt not but tho&s;e very confident A&s;&s;ertors, the A|merican Whig, and his A&s;&s;ociates, appear in the Eyes of all rea|&s;onable Men, in the very Colours with which they would paint others; for, like the Papi&s;ts, Enemies to our good Government, they have ever endeavoured to foment Divi&s;ions among his Ma|je&s;ty's peaceable Subjects by railing again&s;t E&s;tabli&s;hments, and &s;cattering their poi&s;onous, di&s;cordant Principles round the Land. They have al&s;o acted repugnant to the Spirit of Chri&s;tianity, which breathes a Love for all Mankind: which is tender, long &s;uffering, pitiful, courteous, which de&s;pi&s;es the narrow Princi|ples of Rancour and Sectari&s;m; which hopeth all Things, be|lieveth all Things. Their Conduct is al&s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with &s;ound Policy, which bids us diffu&s;e among our fellow Subjects a Reverence for Government; which enjoins us to promote the general Intere&s;ts of Religion; and which at this nice Juncture direct us, more e&s;pecially, to increa&s;e Harmony and Union, and to &s;trengthen, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the Reins of Government.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>EVEN in the&s;e Realms of Woe, Experience has at length convinced me, that Comfort may fixd an Entrance. My Situation, whether con&s;idered ab&s;tractedly, as relating only to my&s;elf, or as it is rendered more di&s;mal by that of my fellow Pri&s;oners, has been gloomy indeed, and I can truly &s;ay, that 'till the Publication of your fir&s;t Number, I was altogether un|happy: But as the Tran&s;actions of you Mortals are not hid from our Eyes, the American Whig in all his Glory, could not fail of contributing &s;ome Relief to tho&s;e Agonies of Mind I have &s;o long &s;uffered, in beholding England, and its Dependen|cies, flouri&s;hing under the E&s;tabli&s;hment of religious Principles, diametrically oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e which I &s;o &s;trongly inculcated by my&s;elf and Emi&s;&s;aries, and which with un&s;peakable Joy, I find you and my other Friends &s;o faithfully adhere to.

<P>A Super&s;tructure, who&s;e foundation gives way, and mu&s;t e|very few years, receive new props for its &s;upport, is evi|dently not the contrivance of a wi&s;e ma&s;ter-builder. That this is the ca&s;e, with modern epi&s;copacy, will be evident to every one, who con&s;iders, the &s;everal foundations, which have been at different times e&s;teemed its &s;upport. If we look back but a|bout thirty years, we &s;hall find the then advocates for dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy, endeavouring to defend their cau&s;e, by alledging, that the &s;acred &s;cripture expre&s;sly &s;peaks of Bi&s;hops in the church. They depended upon making it appear, that tho&s;e who in the New Te&s;tament, are &s;tiled <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> were an order di&s;tinct from, and &s;uperior to, &s;uch as were &s;tiled <HI>Pre&s;byters.</HI>&mdash; While the&s;e &s;cripture-bi&s;hops were trumped up, as a &s;uf|ficient foundation for modern epi&s;copacy; the di&s;tinction between Apo&s;tles, and all other go&s;pel mini&s;ters, was readily acknow|ledged. It was readily acknowledged, that the <HI>apo&s;tolate</HI> was a gift received immediately from Chri&s;t, that it was a per&s;onal gift, not to be communicated from one to another,&mdash;it was rea|dily acknowledged, that Apo&s;tles, as di&s;tinct from, and &s;uperior to all other go&s;pel-mini&s;ters, were made &s;uch, by their being <HI>cho&s;en witne&s;&s;es of Chri&s;t, to the world; that he had appeared in the fle&s;h, that he had &s;uffered, died, aro&s;e from the dead, and a&s;cended into Heaven.</HI> By their being <HI>in&s;pired,</HI> or <HI>divinely illu|minated with the knowledge of the whole go&s;pel &s;cheme.</HI>&mdash; By their being entru&s;ted with the important me&s;&s;age of <HI>publi&s;h|ing to the world the truths and doctrines of the go&s;pel; and de|claring the way of life, and terms of Salvation.</HI>&mdash;And by their being authori&s;ed to <HI>con&s;titute, form and regulate the go&s;pel church &s;tate, according to the mind of Chri&s;t; together with a capacity to give full proof of their acting with authority from Chri&s;t, in tho&s;e matters, by working miracles, &amp;c'</HI> The&s;e things u&s;ed to be acknowledged to be the things by which the Apo&s;tles as &s;uch, were con&s;tituted, and di&s;tingui&s;hed from all other mi|ni&s;ters in the church. It u&s;ed to be acknowledged that the commi&s;&s;ion in Matt. xxviii. 28, did relate to them, not as A|po&s;tles,
<PB N="245" REF="011212_0127_0F862E32935514D8">but as the order of mini&s;ters, which was to continue in the church, to the end of the world; and con&s;equently in which they were to have &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. It is but a &s;ew years &s;ince, that the warme&s;t advocates for epi&s;copacy, could readily &s;ee and admit the&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hing gifts and qualifications, which con&s;tituted, and were e&s;&s;ential to the apo&s;tolick office; while they depended upon &s;upporting epi&s;copacy, by the in&s;tances of &s;uch as were &s;tiled Bi&s;hops in the New-Te&s;tament. But having been obliged, by the &s;uperior force of truth, to acknowledge, that in the &s;cripture, the term <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> and <HI>Pre&s;byter</HI> or <HI>Elder,</HI> are promi&s;cuou&s;ly u&s;ed for the &s;ame office; they now generally give up what but about thirty years ago, was their whole de|pendence; and are obliged to fabricate a new foundation to &s;upport their admired epi&s;copacy. The pre&s;ent &s;cheme is to make us believe, that the bi&s;hops of the Church of England, are Apo&s;tles. The pre&s;ent zealots for prelacy are &s;o &s;trangely infatuated, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to deny, that any thing extraordinary, is nece&s;|&s;ary to make an apo&s;tle. They can now &s;ee none of tho&s;e ex|traordinary gifts, conferred upon the twelve Apo&s;tles by Chri&s;t him&s;elf, as being nece&s;&s;ary; but &s;uppo&s;e that men at this day, may warrantably act as Apo&s;tles, without any of tho&s;e gifts, by virtue of the commi&s;&s;ion Chri&s;t gave to the &s;tanding officers in the church. And by this new &s;cheme would per&s;uade us, that the pre&s;ent &s;et of Bi&s;hops in the Engli&s;h church, are as much Apo&s;tles, and as much ve&s;ted with the apo&s;tolick office and au|thority as ever were Peter or Paul. <HI>A notable &s;cheme this!</HI> And which, if they can e&s;tabli&s;h, will effectually &s;upport their lord|ly and domineering purpo&s;es. For if their Bi&s;hops, are equal with the Apo&s;tles, in point of office and authority, then they have as much power to mould and fa&s;hion the form and regula|tions of the church, to their own humour and liking, as the twelve Apo&s;tles had. And to di&s;pute the matter with them, is to di&s;pute the authority of an Apo&s;tle; and equally criminal with rejecting the authority of the &s;acred books of the New-Te&s;tament. To what length will blind zoal, and party &s;pirit carry weak mortals!</P>
<P>But before we oppo&s;e the authority of an Apo&s;tle, let us hear their defence, and &s;ee what evidence they adduce that their Bi|&s;hops are Apo&s;tles.</P>
<P>Dr. Chandler tells us, that he will only give us a &s;ketch of the arguments of epi&s;copacy; and for better &s;atisfaction, refers us to Archbi&s;hop Potter, and Mr. Leaming. And in the la&s;t of tho&s;e authors, do we find in page 10. this remarkable intelli|gence, <Q>Let it be carefully remarked, that tho&s;e who were commi&s;&s;ioned to &s;end others, were called <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> in the
<PB N="246" REF="011212_0128_0F862E32A0BD06F8">Time when the New-Te&s;tament was penned; but in the next, and after ages, out of honour to the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> the <HI>apo|&s;tolick office,</HI> had the name of <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> appropriated to it.</Q> LET IT BE CAREFULLY REMARKED that out of honour to the fir&s;t &s;et of Apo&s;tles, the very next &s;et of Apo&s;tles, laid a&s;ide the name which Chri&s;t had given to that order; and in&s;tead of it, took the name of <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> which till then, did belong to that order which was al&s;o &s;tiled Elders! <HI>Let it be carefully remark|ed,</HI> that this alteration in the u&s;e of words, was brought about, all the world over, through the whole church, immediately up|on the death of the la&s;t of the Apo&s;tles; that tho&s;e who till then, were di&s;tingui&s;hed by the title of <HI>Apo&s;tle,</HI> &s;hould all agree to lay a&s;ide that title, &s;o that no ONE, in the church univer&s;al, was ever known to be &s;tiled an Apo&s;tle, after the death of the <HI>fir&s;t twelve;</HI> and that all &s;uch as were really Apo&s;tles, &s;hould, forever after be known, and di&s;tingui&s;hed by the title of <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> which till that moment, had been given only to Pre&s;byters. <HI>Let it be carefully remarked;</HI> and truly remarkable it is, that &s;uch a piece of hi&s;tory &s;hould life &s;o long concealed, and never be publi&s;hed to the world, till within the&s;e few years.</P>
<P>Upon hearing &s;o extraordinary a novelty, the following inqui|ries will naturally ari&s;e in the minds of the curious: If the &s;e|cond &s;ett of Apo&s;tles, were really Apo&s;tles as well as the fir&s;t; what rea&s;on could they have, for &s;uch an exce&s;&s;ive veneration for the per&s;ons of their immediate predece&s;&s;ors, as to relinqui&s;h the title Chri&s;t had given to their office; and rob another &s;ett of officers in the church, of a title which did confe&s;&s;edly belong to them? Or was the &s;econd &s;ett of Apo&s;tles, a&s;hamed to be known by the title, which had been given to the poor fi&s;her|men of Gallilee? Or was it for &s;ear that if they retained the nam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, they &s;hould al&s;o be expo&s;ed to like &s;ufferings with their predece&s;&s;ors? Or is it not, becau&s;e that after the death of the fir&s;t <HI>twelve,</HI> there were none who were really Apo&s;tles? This is the true rea&s;on, why there have been none &s;ince, who have pretended to the name, till very lately? It is therefore to be hoped, that the&s;e retailers of ancient hi&s;tory, will in &s;ome fu|ture publications, inform the world how the&s;e things were.</P>
<P>Again, this author, to whom the Dr. refers us, exerts him|&s;elf to prove that Timothy was an Apo&s;tle in the church of Ephe&s;us. And in proof of it, recites &s;everal particular charges, which the Apo&s;tle Paul gave him, in the two epi&s;tles written to him, which he &s;uppo&s;eth would &s;erve to &s;hew Timothy, to have authority in the church above, and over Pre&s;byters; and that he mu&s;t therefore nece&s;&s;arily be an Apo&s;tle. But let Timothy have what authority over the Elders in the church of Ephe&s;us,
<PB N="247" REF="011212_0128_0F862E32A0BD06F8">he can &s;uppo&s;e; It is evident that the Apo&s;tle Paul exerci&s;ed much more authority over Timothy, than the <HI>Apo&s;tle Timothy</HI> did over the Elders of Ephe&s;us. And con&s;equently, according to this argument, there mu&s;t be Apo&s;tles over Apo&s;tles, as well as Apo&s;tles over Elders. And where &s;hall we &s;top, till we come to the <HI>Apo&s;tle general,</HI> the pretended &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Peter?</P>
<P>It is very evident, that Timothy, as well as &s;everal other e|vangeli&s;ts, were under the authority and direction of the Apo|&s;tle Paul; and were &s;ent by him to one place after another, as occa&s;ion required. And Timothy di&s;covered a continual readi|ne&s;s to comply with his injunctions in the propagating of the go&s;pel, and in the &s;ervice of the churches. But if Timothy was an Apo&s;tle as well as Paul, why do we not &s;ome times find him called an Apo&s;tle? Why do we not find him &s;ome times, &s;ending Paul from one church to another, as well as Paul's &s;end|ing him. The Apo&s;tle Paul, wrote many epi&s;tles to the churches; and it was his common method, in his introduction to &s;tile him&s;elf an Apo&s;tle. In many of the&s;e epi&s;tles, Timothy al&s;o is joined with him: And the introduction runs in this form, "Paul an Apo&s;tle of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. and "Timothy our brother." Why does Paul &s;tile him&s;elf an Apo&s;tle, unle&s;s it is to give weight and authority to his epi&s;tles? And if Timothy was al&s;o an Apo&s;tle, why was not his apo&s;tolic character al&s;o mentioned to impart an additional weight? Or was the Apo&s;tle Paul &s;o a&s;piring and lordly, as not to &s;uffer his brother-apo&s;tle Timothy to have equal honour with him&s;elf? The&s;e are inquiries of im|portance in this ca&s;e, and call loudly for a full and &s;atisfactory &s;olution, before a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the apo&s;tolic character and au|thority, of the&s;e pretended &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of the apo&s;tles can be rea&s;onably expected.</P>
<P>While we view this &s;truggle, for the &s;upport of modern epi&s;|copacy, and ob&s;erve how often they are obliged to replace the foundation that &s;upports it; that as often as they find them|&s;elves confuted upon one plan they &s;o readily form to them|&s;elves another; which with much patching, may &s;erve their cau&s;e, for about fifteen or twenty years; and is then given up by their ab&s;ent advocates, and a new one &s;ub&s;tituted in its room: Who, I &s;ay, can &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch a tottering building to be the workman&s;hip of the divine architect? The pre&s;ent &s;cheme of making Apo&s;tles of their Bi&s;hops is too chimerical to be long in vogue; and too ridiculous to bear a &s;erious confutation&mdash; But weak as it is, it mu&s;t be a&s;&s;erted, till &s;ome proli&s;ic genius &s;hall invent another &s;ub&s;titute.</P>

<P>A great many years ago (long before the <HI>citizen</HI> was born) Bi&s;hops were &s;olicited for <HI>America;</HI>&mdash;5 or 6 years ago the affair was vehemently urg'd at home (di&s;intere&s;tedly no doubt!) by one Dr. S&mdash;; and more lately a (&s;till more impatient) <HI>convention</HI> of &s;carce le&s;s than&mdash;XX clergymen, &s;ent home to their &s;uperiors no le&s;s than 7 urgent petitions for a <HI>right re|verend father</HI> or two, and, that their downy lord&s;hips on their arrival might have as little noi&s;e as po&s;&s;ible to di&s;turb their repo&s;e, AFTERWARDS commi&s;&s;ion'd the velvet-mouth'd Dr. C. to a&s;&s;ure the people, that their lord&s;hips wou'd not hurt 'em. But the more prudent, alarm'd, as much perhaps by the pre|po&s;terous conduct of the affair, and the pains taken to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ull them into &s;ecurity, as by the thing it&s;elf, <HI>&s;melt a rat,</HI> and among the re&s;t the <HI>Whig,</HI> thinking it his duty publicly to warn the unwa|ry, in order to ju&s;tify his own apprehen&s;ions, found it nece&s;&s;a|ry (among other things) to di&s;cover the genius of the <HI>Engli&s;h hierarchy;</HI> and this <HI>alarm</HI> has been prever&s;ely repre&s;ented as an <HI>attack</HI> of the <HI>church of England.</HI></P>

<P>The letter from <HI>John Winthrop</HI> and <HI>Co.</HI> is a &s;trong proof of the piety, charity, and affection of tho&s;e our forefathers; but, as it contains not the mo&s;t di&s;tant invitation of any Bi&s;hop to mortify him&s;elf &s;o much as to accompany them, it &s;eems not &s;ufficient to prove (as it &s;hould &s;eem de&s;igned) that <HI>they,</HI> if now living, would be more urgent for the importation of <HI>&s;piritual carnalities</HI> than <HI>we</HI> their "degenerate &s;ons" are.&mdash;<HI>Quere,</HI> was not the &s;crap of <HI>Greek</HI> in the 6th. par. de&s;ign'd to give the good old ladies of this city &amp;c. important ideas of the <HI>citizen's</HI> erudition?</P>
<P>In his next lucubration the <HI>C.</HI> very wi&s;ely tells us, "RELI|GION is advantageous to &s;ociety." Well! and what then?&mdash; why, a civil e&s;tabli&s;hment of a particular form of church go|vernment mu&s;t be &s;o too, according to him; and he even boa&s;ts that the civil e&s;tabli&s;hment of the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hurch of England</HI> "has co&s;t a million of Lives, &amp;c."&mdash;<HI>Excellent form indeed!</HI>&mdash; but what <HI>tickles</HI> me mo&s;t is, that, unle&s;s he very un&s;kilfully ex|pre&s;&s;es him&s;elf, he in effect owns it to have been "indifferent" previous to its e&s;tabli&s;hment; Thus at once giving up the <HI>divine right</HI> of <HI>epi&s;copacy</HI> &s;o much &s;tickled for.&mdash;But whether ex|pre&s;&s;ional or &s;entimental, I mu&s;t not take advantage of his blun|der; for, <HI>I'm told,</HI> he is a child.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Proceed to make &s;ome Remarks on the remaining Parts of the Letter &s;ign'd an American Churchman. <Q>In &s;pite (&s;ays he) of all the Addre&s;s of the Partizans of the Scheme to conceal their true Aim, they have given &s;o many Proofs, that Pre|lates
<PB N="251" REF="011212_0130_0F862E3A44787860">and Bi&s;hops are the Characters they wi&s;h to &s;ee e&s;tabli&s;h|ed among us. And whether this is &s;ufficiently proved mu&s;t be left to the Public to determine.</Q></P>
<P>That any Evidence has been brought of this A&s;&s;ertion, I ab|&s;olutely deny;&mdash;to prove it the American Whig has la|boured only by the Perver&s;ion of harmle&s;s Sentences in the Ap|peal, which common Sen&s;e mu&s;t evince could never be under|&s;tood in that Meaning. On the other Hand, he has pa&s;&s;ed by unnoticed, that Section, wherein the Plan is fairly &s;tated; and where it is declared, that without Equivocation or Re&s;ervation, the Bi&s;hops reque&s;ted are to have no Authority, but purely of a &s;piritual and eccle&s;ia&s;tical Nature, &s;uch as is deriv'd altogether from the Church, and not from the State. The contrary to this I defy his evidencing from any Thing urged by the "Parti|zans of the Scheme," either in public or private.</P>
<P><Q>If (he goes on) the Introduction of Prelacy to &s;ubjugate the Colonies to the Tyranny of Prie&s;ts, is the Object of Dr. Chandler, and the Convention, it becomes every true Son of the Church, every. &amp;c. to ri&s;e up and &s;et his Face like a Flint again&s;t a Scheme of &s;o pernicious a Tendency.</Q> Rare Argumentation for a public Writer! a meer <HI>petitio Principii,</HI> (as the Schoolmen &s;ay:) But &s;uch has been the Foundation of mo&s;t of that pretty Super&s;tructure with which your Opponent has amus'd the Public.&mdash;Indeed, it &s;uch is the De&s;ign of Dr. Chandler and the Convention, the mo&s;t bigotted and &s;trenuous Advocate for an American Epi&s;copate, (I confe&s;s) ought and will oppo&s;e it.&mdash;But on this Hinge turns the Di&s;pute, and this, &s;hould the&s;e bitter Opponents have proved,&mdash;contrary to the Declarations of Men who&s;e Characters are expos'd to the View of the World, to the publi&s;h'd Plan, and the received Opinions and declared Sentiments of the Society for the Propagation of the Go&s;pel, and the highe&s;t Dignitaries of the Church of Eng|land: They &s;hould have evinced the&s;e Declarations to have been untrue by more valid Facts; the Plan to have been fal&s;e, by producing and proving another agreed on; and the&s;e Senti|ments adopted, to be erroneous, by the Proffer of unyielding Truths; if they would de&s;erve the Characters of Chri&s;tians, Lovers of Truth, Gentlemen, and Friends of their Country and Mankind. On the contrary, always pre-&s;uppo&s;ing this to be true, they have work'd them&s;elves into a Ferment, puff'd up their Di&s;ciples with Rage and Zeal, to a danger of Suffocation; be&s;patter'd all around them, and pur&s;ued the Bugg bear, till they have left them&s;elves in &s;uch a Situation, as to attract a rude Stare from Fools,&mdash;Laughter and Contempt from the Wi&s;e,&mdash;the Scorn of good Men, and Approbation only from
<PB N="252" REF="011212_0131_0F862E3C78E0BAE0">tho&s;e who are too prejudic'd, or too blind to &s;ee their Nakedne&s;s.</P>
<P><Q>That the Majority (continues he) of Epi&s;copalians are not chargeable with this dangerous Enterpri&s;e, &s;hall be the Scope of this Letter.</Q></P>
<P>What dangerous Enterpri&s;e? If he means <Q>of &s;ubjugating the Colonies to the Tyranny of Prie&s;ts,</Q> he attempts to prove what no one denies, or have ever denied. <Q>But (&s;ays he) 'tis to remove any &s;uch Su&s;picions, which the guilty Contri|vers of the Plot, are fal&s;ely, and wickedly endeavouring to propagate.</Q> Indeed Mr. Tickle, I am at a Lo&s;s to account by another Way, than the Cau&s;e, for &s;uch gro&s;s Prevarications, In&s;inuations, and Accu&s;ations. I challenge him to prove any Authors of &s;uch a Plot, or to point out the Paper wherein, or the Per&s;ons (excepting the American Whig, and his Allies) by whom American Churchmen are accus'd of <Q>enterpri&s;ing the Subjugation of the Colonies to the Tyranny of Prie&s;ts by the Introduction of Prelacy.</Q></P>
<P>But if he intended, by expre&s;&s;ing it in this loo&s;e indetermi|nate Manner, to leave Room for Equivocation,&mdash;that Church|men might imagine he meant to vindicate them from any De&s;ign again&s;t their Country; and his own Di&s;ciples interpret it as a Proof that the Majority of Epi&s;copalians were aver&s;e to the Plan of an Epi&s;copate as propos'd by Dr. Chandler. By what I have &s;aid before, the Needle&s;sne&s;s, and con&s;equently Impropriety of undertaking it in the fir&s;t Sen&s;e, is evident; and I doubt not, I &s;hall in my following Remarks, make its Ab&s;urdity, Weak|ne&s;s, and Incongruity for the la&s;t Purpo&s;e, obvious to his mo&s;t in&s;atuated Votaries.</P>
<P><Q>This (&s;ays he) may be argued from the Character and Principles of American Churchmen; the Conduct of the Pe|titioners for an Epi&s;copate, and the Nature and Method of their Defence, again&s;t the Attacks they have received.</Q> Fir&s;t, he attempts to prove it from de&s;cribing tho&s;e Parts only of the Character of Churchmen which &s;eem to an&s;wer his Purpo&s;e.&mdash; Now &s;uppo&s;ing the Portrait to be drawn to the Life; it proves nothing in his Favour. For granting that American Church|men are <Q>Enemies to the &s;lavi&s;h Doctrines of pa&s;&s;ive Obedience and Non-re&s;i&s;tance;</Q> <Q>That they excelled in a late memora|ble Oppo&s;ition to the Stamp-Act,</Q> conceding even what is the labour'd Aim of the&s;e Paragraphs; <Q>That they are the mo&s;t frugal Oeconomi&s;ts in the World;</Q> yet it follows not from this that they will be aver&s;e to an Epi&s;copate, when they are not required (to u&s;e a coar&s;e Expre&s;&s;ion from the Paper be|fore me) "to open their Pur&s;e Strings," but to have him &s;up|ported by a Fund graciou&s;ly be&s;tow'd for that Purpo&s;e by Be|nefactors.
<PB N="253" REF="011212_0131_0F862E3C78E0BAE0">Neither tho' Churchmen were watchful (as the Whig de&s;cribes them) of the undue Exten&s;ion of the Preroga|tive, does it follow that they are "oppos'd to a Bi&s;hop &s;o limi|ted in his Powers."</P>
<P>But this Picture of American Churchmen, I deny to be a ju&s;t one; the Lineaments are rough, the Colours laid coar&s;ely on, and &s;ome Features &s;eem rather to be trac'd from the Figure of the four, narrow hearted Pre&s;byterian, than the open-coun|tenanc'd and generous Churchman.</P>
<P>That the Spectator may be better judge of the Truths of this A&s;&s;ertion, I will ju&s;t pencil out in Miniature, a Portrait of Churchmen, whereby it will appear what a Variation he has made from the Original.</P>
<P>In their political Principles American Churchmen in general are fix'd between the Bitterne&s;s of Modern Whigs, and the Servility of ancient Tories. To his Maje&s;ty and the Royal Family, they bear the warme&s;t and mo&s;t unalterable Affection, and are ever ready to &s;upport him in his kingly Power.&mdash;Sen&s;i|ble of the Excellence of the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution, they will ever be ready to pre&s;erve and defend it, and to lay down their Lives in its Support. Convinced of the Ble&s;&s;ings re&s;ulting from the Balance of Authority in the State they de&s;ire it may ever re|main equi-poi&s;ed. Not more &s;olicitous are they to pre&s;erve the Rights of the People, than his Maje&s;ty's Prerogative inviolable. They are &s;teady Friends to Order and Di&s;cipline in Govern|ment, and ever ready to put an End to Di&s;cord and Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P><Q>But (&s;ays this Anti-Churchman) in all their Expences in Government, they are the mo&s;t frugal Oeconomi&s;ts in the World.</Q> Frugality, I mu&s;t own, is commendable: But when &s;peaking of Expences of Government, e&s;pecially at &s;uch a Sea|&s;on as this, the In&s;inuation is very injurious.&mdash;Can this officious Mangler of Characters, deny in the Face of his injured Coun|try, that this Province, as well as its Neighbours, has generou&s;ly and profu&s;ely contributed to the Expences of Government? Were not their vital Sources drain'd almo&s;t dry, by Supplies they granted the la&s;t War?&mdash;The &s;ainting Looks of Commerce, &mdash;the tattered Garments of Trade,&mdash;and the Complaints of Po|verty in our Streets, mu&s;t &s;trike this invidious Accu&s;er dumb!</P>
<P>But perhaps he would be under&s;tood to mean, that they are &s;o in public religious Expences. As for the Non-Epi&s;copalians, they may defend them&s;elves; but quite the contrary is evident from the Conduct of Epi&s;copalians. Their Genero&s;ity, in their Contributions for their Clergy, in Support of their Churches, and for charitable U&s;es, has ever done them Honour. The Non-Epi&s;copalians them&s;elves, have often te&s;tified this, by peti|tioning
<PB N="254" REF="011212_0132_0F862E3D2A120500">their A&s;&s;i&s;tance in many In&s;tances; and I doubt not they have ever met with Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>Animated with the Spirit of their Church, which teaches them to pray for their "Enemies, Per&s;ecutors, and Slanderers," and that God would "bring all into one Fold, under one Shep|herd," they earne&s;tly de&s;ire the Conver&s;ion of the Heathen to the Knowledge of Je&s;us and his Go&s;pel; they behave with Tenderne&s;s and Mildne&s;s to other Denominations; endeavour to calm their Animo&s;ity into Peace; and when their Adver&s;aries have made frequent Attacks on them, they have pa&s;&s;ed them by for the mo&s;t Part, unnoticed as the Offspring of Spleen, Igno|rance or Envy. Satisfied with the Excellence, Purity, and Charity of the Society, of which they are members, they would uphold it with Spirit, but in &s;uch a Manner, as not de&s;ignedly to prejudice others.&mdash;Convinced of the Advantages re&s;ulting from Confirmation, &amp; an orderly Government of their Churches, &mdash;that Epi&s;copacy was in&s;tituted by Chri&s;t, or his Apo&s;tles; and that it is mo&s;t conducive to the Pre&s;ervation of Harmony, and mo&s;t &s;uitable to the con&s;titution of the State, they are its &s;teady Friends.</P>
<P>From this Picture of the Generality of American Epi&s;copali|ans, (which, if any Doubt &s;hould ari&s;e of its Re&s;emblance, may be compared with the Originals) in&s;tead of being "oppo&s;ed" to an Epi&s;copate &s;o limited, it is evident they mu&s;t be &s;trenuous Advocates for it, as they will enjoy that Order and Regularity they &s;o much e&s;teem, and tho&s;e Rites they deem &s;o highly bene|ficial, have a Pro&s;pect open'd of that Conver&s;ion of the Indians they &s;o much de&s;ire; and &s;ee that Church, they are by Princi|ple attached to, recover'd from that Weakne&s;s &s;he labours under, for want of a ready Ordination.</P>
<P>I think it almo&s;t needle&s;s, to take Notice of the palpable Mi&s;repre&s;entations in the remaining Part of this and the &s;ucceed|ing Paragraph: And indeed, to expo&s;e every "Aberration" in this Paper, would be to clean&s;e an Augean Stable Tho' the Epi&s;copalians in Virginia "pay not a blind Devotion to their Clergy," the lea&s;t Counties have two, and mo&s;t of them three Churches; and their Clergymen are &s;upported in a genteel Man|ner, &s;uperior to what the Non-Epi&s;copal Clergy are, in mo&s;t Pro|vinces. As to the Epi&s;copalians re&s;i&s;ting hitherto "the Solici|tations of the lower Clergy, and the Influence of the right Reve|rend Bench in Behalf of an American Bi&s;hop."&mdash;"That our Exemption is occa&s;ioned by the Di&s;countenances an Epi&s;copate hath &s;teadily received from the Epi&s;copalians them&s;elves,"&mdash; they mu&s;t be thrown into the large Heap of tho&s;e improbable and unprov'd Affirmations, which are <HI>vox &amp; preterca nihil.</HI>
<PB N="255" REF="011212_0132_0F862E3D2A120500">Large indeed mu&s;t be the Throats of his Di&s;ciples, if they can &s;wallow as Truths, A&s;&s;ertions which &s;o many Facts evince to be fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, <Q>Upon repewed In&s;tances, (&s;ays the Society for the Propagation of the Go&s;pel) from Governors of Provinces, Mini&s;ters, Ve&s;tries, and private Per&s;ons in the Plantations, for &s;ettling, Eccle&s;ia&s;tic Superiors there, &amp;c.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Ab&s;tract.

<P>The Conduct of the Clergy in this Affair, has been, agreeable to their Duty, and well plea&s;ing to the Government: And they may flatter them&s;elves with a &s;ucce&s;sful Accompli&s;hment of their Plan, from the gracious Reception of their Petitions, and the Approbation of their Superiors. As "to the Umbrage" this Connoi&s;&s;eur in Politics &s;uppo&s;es "the Government and Bi&s;hop of will take at their Proceedings.&mdash;I could whi&s;per &s;ome|thing in his Ear,&mdash;but it might endanger his bur&s;ting with that Spleen, with which he is already &s;o violently di&s;tended!</P>
<P>I cannot help remarking, Sir, in my Way, the malevolent Stroke he aims at the Conventions of the Epi&s;copal Clergy; not that I doubt of their being approved of by the Bi&s;hop of London, and every Friend of Chri&s;tianity; (I know they are) but as it &s;erves undeniably to prove, that the Enemies of the Church will &s;hut up every Source of Succour from her, and remain un&s;atisfied till they have levell'd her with the Ground.</P>

<HEAD>From Mr. PARKER'S GAZETTE, Nov. 7. The AMERICAN WHIG. [No. XXXV.]</HEAD>
<P>DOCTOR Chandler, having in his fir&s;t &s;ection, repre&s;ented the bi&s;hops of the church of England, as being Apo&s;tles; proceeds in his next, to point out tho&s;e powers which are in&s;e|perable from, and peculiar to the office. Under this head, the public to whom he appeals, might rea&s;onably have expected, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;criptural repre&s;entation of tho&s;e peculiar gifts and powers, by which the twelve Apo&s;tles of our Lord were at that time di&s;|tingui&s;hed from all other officers in the Chri&s;tian church. And had he collected his account from the New Te&s;tament; he mu&s;t have repre&s;ented their di&s;tingui&s;hing qualifications, to have con|&s;i&s;ted in, "Their being cho&s;en witne&s;&s;es of Chri&s;t to the world, &mdash;their being &s;ent forth to publi&s;h his go&s;pel, and erect his church among all mankind.&mdash;Their being furni&s;hed for this work, by the infallible guidance, and miraculous gift of the Holy Spirit; together with a power of conveying &s;uch gifts of the Spirit as the Holy Gho&s;t (not the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves) tho't proper, to the converts to Chri&s;tianity, by the laying on of their hands. It is by the&s;e things, and the&s;e only, that the Apo&s;tles are di&s;tingui&s;hed from other officers in the church, in the New-Te&s;tament. But in&s;tead of this &s;criptural de&s;cription of the apo&s;tolic office, the Dr. has arbitrarily a&s;&s;igned &s;uch peculiar prerogatives, as are at this day claimed by the pre&s;ent new-mo|deled &s;et of Apo&s;tles in the church of England, viz. <HI>government,
<PB N="257" REF="011212_0133_0F862E3DE3719FA8">ordination,</HI> and <HI>confirmation.</HI> It may be true what the Dr. &s;ays, in p. 15. "In the Chri&s;tian church, the Apo&s;tles were in|ve&s;ted with this power (of government) by Chri&s;t; as it was in|tended for perpetual u&s;e, they conveyed it to their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors."&mdash; But his next a&s;&s;ertion is couched in &s;uch ambiguous expre&s;&s;ions, as &s;eem de&s;igned to deceive the incautious reader. This power he &s;ays, "was exerci&s;ed by Timothy at Ephe&s;us, by Titus at Crete, by Dyoni&s;ius the Areopagite at Athens, by Epaphroditus at Philippi, by Archippus at Colo&s;&s;e, &amp;c." Here the Dr. in order to have been con&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf, ought to have &s;hewn, that Timothy, Titus, Dyoni&s;ius, &amp;c. were real Apo&s;tles, and did exerci&s;e the power of government in the church, by virtue of their &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the apo&s;tolic office, con&s;idered as di&s;tinct from, and &s;uperior to other officers in the church. Without this all his pretended argumentation on this head, is mere tri|fling. He well knows, that government in the church, is uni|ver&s;ally allowed to be of divine appointment; and that it is to be exerci&s;ed by the appointed officers in the church. But if he would prove any thing to his purpo&s;e, he mu&s;t prove, that church government is to be exerci&s;ed by none but &s;uch as are properly &s;tiled Apo&s;tles, and that his bi&s;hops are &s;uch.&mdash;Had he been con&s;i&s;tent, he mu&s;t have &s;aid that Timothy, Titus, Dyoni&s;ius, &amp;c. were as really Apo&s;tles as Paul him&s;elf was. But had he &s;aid this, every common ready would have &s;een the fal&s;ehood of his a&s;&s;ertion, and the weakne&s;s of his argument. For every one who reads the Bible, mu&s;t know, not only that the&s;e men were never once &s;tiled <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> in the &s;cripture, but that they have not one of tho&s;e qualifications a&s;cribed to them, which were peculiar to the Apo&s;tles, as &s;uch. And the Doctor's own repre&s;entation, is a flat contradiction to that on which the whole &s;tre&s;s of his argument depends. For the Apo&s;tles as &s;uch, had the whole world for their charge; they had a right to exerci&s;e their apo&s;tolick power, wherever they went. It was not the de&s;ign of their office, to fix them&s;elves down in a parti|cular bi&s;hopric, and act as Apo&s;tles there, and no where el&s;e. But Timothy, Titus, Dyoni&s;ius, &amp;c. whom the Dr. would have us believe were really Apo&s;tles, are repre&s;ented, as being fixed down in their re&s;pective places, to exerci&s;e their apo&s;tolick power only in &s;uch places. And altho' to an attentive reader, he evi|dently contradicts the notion of their being Apo&s;tles; yet he hereby cra&s;tily metamorpho&s;es the apo&s;tolick office to make it harmonize with the &s;tate of the bi&s;hops of the church of Eng|land, who are fixed down in their re&s;pective bi&s;hopricks, whom he ridiculou&s;ly repre&s;ents as clad with the apo&s;tolick character and authority.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="011212_0134_0F862E3EACB26200">After this ambiguous and falacious repre&s;entation, our ap|pellant proceeds to lay down, this very remarkable a&s;&s;ertion, "The bi&s;hop may communicate this power, in &s;ome degree, to Pre&s;byters or others, as he &s;hall think proper; but in &s;uch ca&s;es it mu&s;t be exerci&s;ed in &s;ubordination to him." A truly &s;urpri|&s;ing claim of power this! "The bi&s;hop may communicate this power in &s;ome degree,&mdash;as he &s;hall think proper." If this is the ca&s;e, then the bi&s;hop may communicate one degree of this power to one, and another to another: And by this means, may introduce as many different orders into the church, ve&s;ted with different degrees of power, <HI>as he &s;hall think proper.</HI> It is well known, that the Pope claims this power of office-making in the church: But I believe, Dr. Chandler is the fir&s;t prote&s;tant wri|ter who has claimed it as the right of an Engli&s;h bi&s;hop. It is a pity, he has not told us preci&s;ely what degree of this power, the Apo&s;tle Paul communicated to Timothy, to Titus, to Dyoni|&s;ius, &amp;c. whether he communicated the &s;ame degree of power to them all; or one degree of it to one, and another Degree to another.&mdash;But be that as it will: yet, if the&s;e degrees of power, communicated by the bi&s;hop to pre&s;byters and others, are ac|cording as he &s;hall think proper, then the public is to hear no more of the three orders, of bi&s;hops, prie&s;ts and deacons, as be|ing &s;et in the church by <HI>divine appointment.</HI> For the Dr. tells us, that the&s;e &s;everal powers, are as the bi&s;hop <HI>&s;hall think pro|per.</HI> Thus he boldly rejects the <HI>darling trinity</HI> of his brethren.</P>
<P>Again, there is &s;omething peculiarly remarkable in the&s;e words, <HI>As he &s;hall think proper,</HI> as they &s;tand in connection with the re&s;t of the &s;entence. Prote&s;tants have commonly held, that the degree of power, communicated to any one in the church, was to be determined by the form of words, and the &s;acred rites u&s;ed in his inve&s;titure. But the Doctor tells us, the degree of power is to be determined by the bi&s;hop's &s;ecret inten|tion, <HI>as he &s;hall think proper.</HI> It is well known, what great pro|fits have been made of this principle, by the popi&s;h clergy:&mdash; But it is really &s;urpri&s;ing, that a prote&s;tant divine; yea, and a Doctor of divinity, &s;hould undertake to re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch explo|ded &s;entiments.</P>
<P>Let it be further remarked, that the Dr. here tells us, the bi&s;hop may communicate this power, in &s;ome degree of it, to pre&s;by|ters and others. He has not told us, who or what the&s;e others are be&s;ides pre&s;byters, to whom the bi&s;hop many communicate of his power. Tho&s;e indeed, who are acquainted with the con|&s;titution of the epi&s;copal church, need be at no lo&s;s in determin|ing who are tho&s;e others here intended. It is well known, that be&s;ides the clergy, there is a long li&s;t of lay-officers belong|ing
<PB N="259" REF="011212_0134_0F862E3EACB26200">to their &s;piritual courts: Their lay-chancellors, commi&s;&s;a|ries, proctors, &amp;c. to whom the bi&s;hop communicates &s;ome de|gree of his power. But let me remind this advocate for the epi&s;copal church, that the public to whom he appeals, has ju&s;t rea&s;on to expect that he &s;hould &s;hew &s;ome &s;cripture warrant for the bi&s;hop, in his parcelling out the&s;e &s;everal degrees of his power, received from Chri&s;t, among his own creatures, depend|ants and favourites.</P>
<P>The Dr. has peremptorily declared, that no &s;uch thing as &s;piritual courts, are to be erected by bi&s;hops in America. But what &s;ecurity can be give to the public, that no &s;uch courts &s;hall be erected by the bi&s;hop when he comes? For he here ex|pre&s;ly a&s;&s;erts, that the bi&s;hop may communicate this power, in &s;ome degree, to pre&s;byters and others, as he &s;hall think proper. If therefore, the&s;e communications of power, are to be as the bi&s;hop &s;hall think proper; I demand, in the name of common &s;en&s;e, how this gentleman can pretend to know, that the bi&s;hop &s;hall not think proper to erect his &s;piritual courts among us; or by what logic he will convince mankind that no &s;uch thing is intended.</P>
<P>There is one pa&s;&s;age more in this remarkable &s;entence, that &s;till remains to be con&s;idered. The Dr. tells us, <Q>The bi&s;hop may communicate this power,&mdash;but in &s;uch ca&s;es, it mu&s;t be exerci&s;ed in &s;ubordination to him, &amp;c.</Q> Is this then really the ca&s;e, in the church of England, that the bi&s;hop only, acts in &s;ubordination to Chri&s;t; but all others that are ve&s;ted with eccle&s;ia&s;tical authority, act in &s;ubordination to the bi&s;hop? Hence then, we have no longer rea&s;on to think it &s;trange, that an oath of canonical obedience to the bi&s;hop and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, &s;hould be exacted of every one, at the time of his receiving <HI>holy orders.</HI> According to this repre&s;entation, the Dr. him&s;elf is not a mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; but of the bi&s;hop, who com|municated to him &s;ome degree of his power.</P>
<P>He further adds, that the bi&s;hop "can never dive&s;t him&s;elf of his controuling and &s;uperintending authority. It is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to his office, that he cannot relinqui&s;h it in &s;uch a manner, as not to be accountable for the exerci&s;e of it." And yet, how notorious is it, that the judges in the bi&s;hops court, act in many ca&s;es directly contrary to the mind of the Bi&s;hops? It &s;eems however, that the&s;e &s;piritual-court officers, have nothing to &s;ear from the expectation of an after-reckoning, becau&s;e not they, but the bi&s;hop it &s;eems, mu&s;t be accountable for their conduct.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, there is but little rea&s;on to expect, that the public will be much enamoured with the government of the church, as it is exerci&s;ed by the&s;e Anglican Apo&s;tles, who&s;e tran&s;|portation
<PB N="260" REF="011212_0135_0F862E3F6BF29C40">to America, is &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ired. The other two peculiar and di&s;tingui&s;hing qualifications of the Doctor's Apo&s;|tles, are ordination and confirmation. The la&s;t of the&s;e, has already been fully con&s;idered; and I flatter my&s;elf, in the opi|nion of every impartial reader, clearly confuted. The other I &s;hall make the &s;ubject of &s;ome future paper; a&s;&s;uring the Dr. that no part of his Appeal in which he has even attempted to rea&s;on, &s;hall be pa&s;&s;ed over without a &s;erious examination, which it is hoped, will convince him, that his triumph in his adverti&s;e|ment on the publication of the fir&s;t number of the American Whig, which tho' it treated with ridicule, &s;uch parts of his boa&s;ted performance, as were really <HI>ridiculous,</HI> and con&s;equently not the &s;ubject of argument, promi&s;ed at the &s;ame time, "fully to con&s;ider every part of the pamphlet, that re&s;pects the merits of the cau&s;e;" this I &s;ay, 'tis to be hoped will convince him, that his triumph was really puerile and premature, and ought to teach him to be le&s;s impatient of contradiction, e&s;pecially after inviting, not to &s;ay challenging the whole world to make their objections.</P>
<P>When I have refuted every part of this dangerous &s;ophi&s;tical and je&s;uitical pamphlet, I &s;hall proceed to give a full reply, to the &s;currilous vindication of the Bi&s;hop of Landaff's &s;ermon, which is generally &s;uppo&s;ed to be the joint fabrication of the convention, and to be prefaced by the Rev. Mr. Inglis, there|unto doubtle&s;s lawfully <HI>conventionated,</HI> as being the mo&s;t mo|derate, (after the candid and moderate Dr. Chandler) of the whole fraternity.</P>

<P>SO weak and yet &s;o <HI>ill natur'd</HI> is <HI>Nov-anglus's</HI> letter in the 23d <HI>Whip,</HI> that I've had thought of going to bed in an ill humour and <HI>dreaming</HI> a few remarks upon it.

<HEAD>From Mr. GAINE'S GAZETTE, Nov. 7. A WHIP for the AMERICAN WHIG. By TIMOTHY TICKLE, ESQR. [No. XXXI.]</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><P>The <HI>WHIGS</HI> rai&s;e the Spirits of their Friends, recal their Stragglers, and unite their Numbers by Sound and Impudence, as Bees a&s;&s;emble and cling together at the Noi&s;e of <HI>BRASS.</HI></P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE profe&s;&s;ed De&s;ign on which the American Whig &s;et out, "was, to confute Dr. Chandler'. Appeal." How far, and how often he hath wandered from this Point, deviating into the Bye paths of Defamation, mu&s;t be evident to all his unpre|judiced Readers. His di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">igent Malice, it is true, hath here and there fixed on a Pa&s;&s;age of the Appeal, from which he hath endeavoured to extract a Meaning which the Words, without the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tmo&s;t Violence done to them, would not bear; and which, I may venture to affirm, never once entered into the Doctor's Mind.</P>
<P>But even this Kind of Confutation, &s;uch as it is, takes up the &s;malle&s;t Part of his Papers. They are &s;trewed thick with In|vectives again&s;t the Clergy, as well as the Con&s;titution, the Di&s;cipline and Principles of the Church of England. The Per&s;on mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s an uncommon Share of Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">city, who can &s;ee in this, the lea&s;t Connection with the Subject he took in Hand, &mdash;the lea&s;t Con&s;i&s;tency with the Character he a&s;&s;umes of a De|fender of religious Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erty, or with the Chri&s;tian Temper. I own my Sagacity is unequal to to the Ta&s;k. Perhaps he may think that by protracting the Controver&s;y thus, he will frighten or tire the Friends of the Church and of religious Liberty. But in this he will find him&s;elf mi&s;taken. I hope the Public will pardon me, if in following the Whig I &s;hould degre&s;s from what is properly the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bject of Debate. For this I am not to blame; as my Intention was principally to correct his Errors.</P>
<P>The &s;ingle Point that is now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> before the Tribunal of the Public,&mdash;at lea&s;t that &s;hould be deb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ted&mdash;is this&mdash;"Should the Members of the Church of England in America have one or more Bi&s;hops fixed here on the Plan propo&s;ed in Doctor Chandler's Appeal?" To write again&s;t any other Plan or Bi&s;hops is nothing to the Purpo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">. I am convinced that neither the Author of the Appeal, nor his Brethren, nor any other Members of the Church, de&s;ire a Bi&s;hop on any other Term
<PB N="264" REF="011212_0137_0F862E40F27B9580">than &s;uch as the &s;aid Appeal has &s;pecified. The Whig has not yet produced the lea&s;t Shadow of Proof to the contrary. He has publi&s;hed Letters which he &s;ays were written by Mi&s;&s;ionaries and other Members of the Church, to their Friends, where we may naturally &s;uppo&s;e they freely declare their Sentiments.&mdash; he is bu&s;y in que&s;t of Intelligence by every Method his fertile <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">magination can &s;ugge&s;t: Yet nothing has yet appeared to &s;hew that Churchmen have applied for, or de&s;ire a Bi&s;hop ve&s;ted with any Powers but tho&s;e which are purely &s;piritual. Such a Bi&s;hop they want,&mdash;&s;uch only they have applied for.</P>
<P>Dr. Chandler, willing to obviate every Objection to an Ame|rican Epi&s;copate that had the lea&s;t Colour of Rea&s;on; &s;tates the following.&mdash;<Q>Another Objection has been made by &s;ome, to the following Purport; That if Bi&s;hops are once &s;ettled in America, although in the Manner we now propo&s;e, there will probably be an Augmentation of their Power, as &s;oon as Circum&s;tances will admit of it: And what is ea&s;y and inof|fen&s;ive in its Beginning, may become burthen&s;ome and op|pre&s;&s;ive in the End.</Q></P>
<P>And then adds,&mdash;<Q>But at this Rate, there can be no End of objecting. For if every po&s;&s;ible ill Effect of a Thing, although confe&s;&s;edly proper in it&s;elf and harmle&s;s in its na|tural Tendency, may be made an Argument again&s;t it, there is nothing that can e&s;cape. Appeal p. 109.</Q></P>
<P>The Doctor proceeds to &s;hew that Objections of this Sort may as fairly be alledged again&s;t a religious Toleration,&mdash;again&s;t reading the Scriptures, or a learned Education. Each of the&s;e is liable to be abu&s;ed, and is often <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ttended with &s;ome bad Ef|fects: Yet Prote&s;tants in general agree that the&s;e are upon the Whole u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary, and &s;uch as every Chri&s;tian has an undoubted Right to. The natural Inference from all which is this, That the ill Effects which &s;ome may be plea&s;ed to think will probably attend the &s;ending Bi&s;hops to America, ve&s;ted only, with &s;piritual Powers, can be no ju&s;t Objection again&s;t this Mea|&s;ure; e&s;pecially when their Apprehen&s;ions on this Head are to|tally devoid of any Foundation, and it is improbable in the highe&s;t Degree that any &s;uch Effects will follow.</P>
<P>The American Whig No. XVI, hath taken the Pa&s;&s;age above quoted from the Appeal, into his mo&s;t critical Con&s;ideration. However, he does not offer a Syllable that will invalidate this Inference. He rings the Changes on the Words probable and po&s;&s;ible, till he becomes mo&s;t tedious, di&s;gu&s;ting and unintelligi|ble. He in&s;inuates that Dr. Chandler in his an&s;wer to the Ob|jection, &s;ub&s;tituted the Word <HI>po&s;&s;ible,</HI> in the Place of <HI>probable,</HI>
<PB N="265" REF="011212_0137_0F862E40F27B9580">to evade the Force of the Argument. But every Per&s;on of the lea&s;t Di&s;cernment, mu&s;t perceive that the Doctor, when he u&s;ed the Word <HI>probable,</HI> put it in the Mouth of the &s;uppo&s;ed Objec|tor: When he u&s;ed the Word <HI>po&s;&s;ible,</HI> he &s;peaks in his own Name. The ill Effects which in the Objection are &s;uppo&s;ed to be probable, he denies to be &s;uch, but barely po&s;&s;ible only; and ju&s;tly ob&s;erves from thence, <Q>That if every po&s;&s;ible ill Ef|fect of a Thing, although confe&s;&s;edly proper in it&s;elf and harmle&s;s in its natural Tendency, may be made an Argument again&s;t it, there is nothing that can e&s;cape." The Doctor a&s;&s;erts that the "propo&s;ed Epi&s;copate has a natural Tenden|cy to produce no ill Con&s;equences,</Q> &s;uch as are alledged in the Objection. If he thought &s;o for good Rea&s;on, and that tho&s;e ill Effects which the Objector &s;uppo&s;ed probable, were barely po&s;&s;ible, had he not a Right to &s;ay &s;o? Evidently, there is in this no "Sophi&s;try," no "Artifice," with which the Whig very decently charges him. The Rea&s;oning is conclu&s;ive, the Inference is ju&s;t.</P>
<P>Dr. Chandler is fully able to vindicate him&s;elf, and doubtle&s;s will do &s;o at a proper Sea&s;on. In the mean Time, I will here briefly &s;hew the Improbability that the ill Effects, implied in the Objection, (and which are ha&s;hed up and dealt out weekly to the Public by the American Whig) will accompany the propo&s;ed Epi&s;copate. The ill Effects are, Spiritual Courts, the Inve&s;ti|ture of Bi&s;hops with temporal Power, taxing the Colonies for their Support, and paying Tythes. Now that the&s;e Con&s;equen|ces will attend an American Epi&s;copate, or that the&s;e Appen|dages will be annexed to the Epi&s;copal Office, either when Bi|&s;hops are fir&s;t &s;ent to America, or in any future Time, is impro|bable to the la&s;t Degree,&mdash;&s;o far as human Fore&s;ight can reach, I might &s;ay impo&s;&s;ible; and this for the following plain, evident Rea&s;ons.&mdash;</P>

In each of the&s;e, and many others I could mention, tho&s;e Temporal Powers, Spiritual Courts, Taxes and Tythes are utterly di&s;claimed, and no Powers are propo&s;ed to be given to American Bi&s;hops, but &s;uch as are purely &s;piritual, viz. To ordain and &s;uperintend the Clergy, and confirm &s;uch as choo&s;e that Ordinance.</P>
<P N="2">2. BECAUSE in all the late Applications to England for an Epi&s;copate, none but &s;uch a primitive Bi&s;hop as I have mention|ed, is propo&s;ed or de&s;ired. I have been lately favoured with a Sight of the &s;even Petitions or Addre&s;&s;es to our Superiors at Home, &s;o famous in the Annals of American Whiggi&s;m; and I here declare in the Words of Truth and Sincerity, that there is not in any of them &s;o much as a di&s;tant Hint de&s;iring Bi&s;hops, ve&s;ted with tho&s;e Powers and Appendages, mentioned by the E|nemies of an American Epi&s;copate. On the contrary, they ap|ply only for Bi&s;hops ve&s;ted with the Power of ordaining and go|verning the Clergy, and admini&s;tring Confirmation. They on|ly de&s;ire that the Inconveniencies with regard to the&s;e Points, a|ri&s;ing from the Want of Bi&s;hops may be removed; that Church|men may be put on an equal Footing with other Denominations, and enjoy equal Privileges; which cannot be the Ca&s;e, unle&s;s Bi&s;hops are &s;ent to America.</P>
<P N="3">3 BECAUSE all the Members of the Church, to a Man, are &s;o far from de&s;iring, that they are extremely aver&s;e to our hav|ing a Bi&s;hop ve&s;ted with temporal Powers, and tho&s;e Appen|dages beforementioned. They are convinced, that &s;uch a Mea|&s;ure would injure the Church&mdash;would probably produce as many Inconveniences to it, as the primitive Bi&s;hop they de&s;ire will a&s;&s;uredly bring real <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dvantages. This &s;ingle Con&s;ideration is &s;ufficient to determine the Judgment of all the Members and Friends of the Church, be&s;ides their being as fa&s;t Friends to every Species of Liberty, religious or civil, as any Di&s;&s;enters that exi&s;t.</P>
<P N="4">4. BECAUSE the Provi&s;ion made for an American Epi&s;copate, clearly evinces, that no other than the primitive Bi&s;hop &s;peci|fied in the Appeal, was or is intended for America, Archbi&s;h|op Tenni&s;on, left One Thou&s;and Pounds, for the Support of one or more American Bi&s;hops. Arch-bi&s;hop Secker, a few Months ago, left an equal Sum for the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, to men|tion no more &s;uch Legacies. But why the&s;e Donations to &s;up|port Bi&s;hops here, if it were intended that they &s;hould be &s;up|ported by a Tax on the Colonies, by Tythes, or the Fees ari|&s;ing from Spiritual Courts? The American Whig him&s;elf will
<PB N="267" REF="011212_0138_0F862E41AF7AE458">not, I pre&s;ume, have the Face to &s;ay, that the&s;e two eminent Prelates were not fully acquainted with the Plan of an Ameri|can Epi&s;copate. Why then would they throw away their E&s;tates unnece&s;&s;arily to &s;upport tho&s;e Bi&s;hops, if another Fund was in|tended here for their Support! Would it not have been ab&s;urd to the la&s;t Degree? The Reader may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, there never was any De&s;ign formed of impo&s;ing &s;uch Taxes and Tythes, or of erecting &s;uch &s;piritual Courts.</P>
<P>Had the American Whig lived when the Society for propaga|ting the Go&s;pel in foreign Parts was incorporated, and was pro|viding Mi&s;&s;ionaries to be &s;ent to the Colonies, he might have inveighed with equal Plau&s;ibility again&s;t that Mea&s;ure, as again&s;t &s;ending Bi&s;hops at this Time. How eloquently might he have expatiated on the many ill Effects which would probably ari&s;e from our having &s;o many Zealots of the Gown fixed here&mdash; That however &s;pecious or harmle&s;s the Plan might be repre&s;ent|ed by prie&s;tly Craft, by the guilty Contrivers of the Plot: Yet the true De&s;ign was to &s;ubjugate the Colonies to Clerical Do|minion&mdash;to impo&s;e Taxes and Tythes for the Support of tho&s;e Mi&s;&s;ionaries, and erect &s;piritual Courts to harra&s;s and plague the good People of America.</P>
<P>All this, and much more in the &s;ame <HI>dulcet</HI> Strain, which flows in &s;uch Abundance from the mellifluous Pen of our Whig, might he have urged again&s;t the Importation of tho&s;e "&s;piritual Carnalities" the Mi&s;&s;ionaries. And what An&s;wer could the So|ciety return to this Kind of Argumentation but the following? That their &s;ole De&s;ign was to &s;upply tho&s;e People with Clergy|men who were de&s;titute of the Ordinances of Religion&mdash; that the Collections made by the Society, the Donations and Legacies of its members, and of other pious Per&s;ons, to &s;upply a Fund for the Support of the Mi&s;&s;ionaries, fully evinced that they did not intend the Impo&s;ition of Tythes, or any Tax what|&s;oever on the Coloni&s;ts, for the Mi&s;&s;ionaries. This an&s;wer would have been &s;atisfactory then to every unprejudiced, &s;en&s;i|ble Per&s;on; and the Experience of more than &s;ixty Years demon|&s;trates it was the Truth.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;e is perfectly &s;imiliar at pre&s;ent. The &s;ame An&s;wer will &s;erve to confute the fal&s;e Sugge&s;tions of the Whig, and his A&s;&s;ociates, concerning an American Epi&s;copate, The &s;ole De|&s;ign of the Society, and other Members of the Church, in pro|po&s;ing that Mea&s;ure, is to remove the Inconveniencies we now labour under, thro' Want of Bi&s;hops, with Regard to Ordina|tion, &s;uperintending the Clergy, and Confirmation. The Dona|tions and Legacies to rai&s;e a Fund to &s;upport American Bi&s;hops, fully evince no other Fund is propo&s;ed, no tax upon the Coloni&s;ts
<PB N="268" REF="011212_0139_0F862E42718E0130">intended; and that the Outcry now rai&s;ed about Taxes, Tythes and &s;piritual Courts, is entirely groundle&s;s&mdash;utterly void of any ju&s;t Foundation.</P>
<P N="5">5. And la&s;tly, Becau&s;e the Spirit of the Times is &s;uch as in|clines People rather to abridge, than add to the Power of the Clergy, both in England and America. It is really plea&s;ant to ob&s;erve to what an Heighth the Whig rai&s;es the eccle&s;ia&s;tical Power, if a Bi&s;hop &s;hould &s;et his Foot on this Continent. He makes him a mere Colo&s;&s;us, that would be&s;tride this whole we&s;tern World, and &s;eize in an In&s;tant all Power, civil and military, as well as &s;piritual. I am &s;ometimes tempted to think the poor Whig is haunted with Bi&s;hops as with Spectres,&mdash;that he nods, and is carried back in his Dreams to tho&s;e monki&s;h Times, when Super&s;tition bore Sway, and People were for giving up every Thing into the Hands of the Mother Church.</P>
<P>But &s;urely he mu&s;t dream, or wor&s;e than dream, who repre|&s;ents this Humour as prevailing in our Day; or would in&s;inuate that there is any Pro&s;pect of it. Any Attempt in Eccle&s;ia&s;tics to encroach on the Rights of others, would not fail of being in&s;tantly cru&s;hed here or el&s;ewhere in the Briti&s;h Dominions; nor would any be more ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t in doing &s;o, than the Mem|bers of the Church. But it would be injurious and fal&s;e to &s;up|po&s;e the American Clergy had any &s;uch De&s;ign. Their Cha|racters are well known; nor are there any warmer Advocates for the Rights and Liberties of their Fellow Subjects among us.</P>
<P>The&s;e Particulars, to which many more might be added, duly con&s;idered, will &s;erve to convince every unprejudiced Per|&s;on, that no Bi&s;hop is de&s;ired on any other Plan than what is mentioned in Dr. <HI>Chandler's Appeal.</HI>&mdash;That the Alarms which are &s;ounded in our Ear by the <HI>Whig's brazen</HI> Trumpet, as if Taxes and Tythes, and Spiritual Courts awaited us, are alto|gether groundle&s;s,&mdash;and that Churchmen in de&s;iring Bi&s;hops, de&s;ire nothing but their Right, and what every other Denomi|nation among us enjoys. Whether the <HI>Whig's</HI> Conduct proceeds from Malice, or from a di&s;tempered, heated Imagination, I will not take upon me to determine. Sure I am, to &s;peak in the mo&s;t charitable Terms, it mu&s;t proceed from a mi&s;guided Zeal, &mdash;"Zeal which is not according to Knowledge."</P>

<HEAD>From Mr. PARKER'S GAZETTE, Nov. 14. The AMERICAN WHIG. [No. XXXVI.]</HEAD>
<P>THE new &s;cheme of converting the Anglican Bi&s;hops into Apo&s;tles, has been of great &s;ervice to Dr. Chandler, in various parts of his Appeal. And that nothing might be wanting in his dignified prelates, to an&s;wer this high and ho|nourable title; he has &s;trip'd the apo&s;tolic character of all tho&s;e divine gifts and qualifications, by which the twelve Apo&s;tles of our Lord were di&s;tingui&s;hed in the primitive church; and made it to con&s;i&s;t only in having the power of government, ordina|tion and confirmation.</P>
<P>It is the Doctor's repre&s;entation of the power of ordination, as being one di&s;tingui&s;hing property of the Apo&s;tle's character, that falls under the pre&s;ent con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The Dr. enters upon this part of his &s;ubject, by enquiring, "To whom can the appointment of inferior and &s;ubordinate officers belong, in every &s;ociety, but to tho&s;e who govern it?" Here we have another &s;pecimen of his peculiar &s;trength of rea|&s;oning; which is not to prove his point, but to beg the que&s;|tion. It belongs to him fir&s;t to prove, that inferior and &s;ub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r|dinate officers in the Chri&s;tian church, have been appointed by Chri&s;t. But by his u&s;ual logick, he takes it for granted, that there are &s;uch under&s;trappers in the church of Chri&s;t; and then, with an air of a&s;&s;urance, enquires, to whom the appoint|ment of them &s;hould belong, but to tho&s;e who have the govern|ment of it. The whole force of his argument depends upon that which he had before a&s;&s;erted, under the preceding head of government, where he proves, in direct oppo&s;ition to both rea&s;on and &s;cripture, by the mere authority of his own <HI>ip&s;e dixit,</HI> that "The Bi&s;hop may communicate this power, in &s;ome degree, to Pre&s;byters and others, as he &s;hall think proper." It is by this almightine&s;s of the Bi&s;hop's communicative power, that he can create as many inferior and &s;ubordinate officers in the church as he plea&s;eth, by communicating this power to one and another, in &s;uch different degrees as he &s;hall think proper. And from this inexhau&s;tible fountain it is, (not from any &s;crip|tural precept, precedent or example,) that the&s;e inferior and &s;ub|ordinate officers in the church, &s;tart into being. And as this regiment of &s;ubalterns, which come not in by the door, but climb up &s;ome other way, owe their exi&s;tence and prerogatives to modern epi&s;copacy; I &s;hall leave the Doctor and his brethren to mar&s;hal them, in their &s;everal ranks of &s;eniority and domi|nion.
<PB N="270" REF="011212_0140_0F862E4323C75128">But if he means thereby to wheedle us out of our &s;crip|tural right of choo&s;ing, and appointing our own mini&s;ters, I mu&s;t tell him, that the public will require &s;ome better evidence, that his Bi&s;hops are really Apo&s;tles, than any that he, or his party, have hitherto produced, before they will con&s;ent, that his Bi&s;h|ops &s;hould appoint them. However, we may here &s;ee a door opened, by the intended importation of Bi&s;hops, for our making u&s;e of our idle pence, as all tho&s;e inferior and &s;ubordinate offi|cers mu&s;t have their &s;hare for a maintainance, as well as my Lord Bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>As a further argument, the Dr. adds, "The &s;ame argument which proves the di&s;tinction of Bi&s;hops from Pre&s;byters, proves al&s;o that ordination is an office peculiar to the former; for it is chiefly by the appropriation of offices, that we are able to prove the di&s;tinction of orders." The &s;ame logick &s;till! It is here again taken for granted, that the &s;cripture appropriates certain offices, to particular officers in the church; which is the thing to be proved. But let us con&s;ider this, which he &s;ays, is his chief argument. He &s;ays, it is proved, that there are different orders in the go&s;pel mini&s;try, becau&s;e there are different parts of the mini&s;terial work appointed; as if it were ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, that the &s;ame officer might perform the whole work. And again, &s;ome particular parts of the mini&s;terial work, are appro|priated to &s;ome particular officers in the church, as appears from there being different orders in the mini&s;try, &s;ome &s;uperior, &s;ome inferior, which &s;hews, that all are not to perform the &s;ame &s;er|vices.&mdash;Thus the Dr. alternately proves the one by the other, or as the Logicians call it, argues in a circle. Let us however, con&s;ider what proof he lays before us, of this appropriation of officers to the different orders in the go&s;pel-mini&s;try. And here, the &s;ubject he is upon, requires that he &s;hould in&s;i&s;t upon the power of ordination, as being peculiarly appropriated to a par|ticular order, viz. Apo&s;tles. Now all accounts of ordination, to be collected from the &s;cripture, are the&s;e: The ordination of Paul and Barnabas.&mdash;The Elders ordained by the&s;e two Apo&s;tles, in the churches which they planted.&mdash;The ordina|tion of Timothy.&mdash;And the ordinations performed by Timo|thy and Titus. The&s;e are all the ordinations the New-Te&s;ta|ment mentions. As to the fir&s;t of tho&s;e, viz. the ordination of Paul and Barnabas, the Dr. will not allow them to be ordina|tions. And why? Not becau&s;e all the parts proper and pecu|liar to an ordination, were not performed; but becau&s;e it was performed, not by Apo&s;tles, but by certain prophets and teach|ers in the church at Antioch. The appropriation of the power of ordination to Apo&s;tles only, is here evidently made, not by the &s;cripture, but by Dr. Chandler.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="011212_0140_0F862E4323C75128">As to the power of Barnabas and Paul, to ordain Elders in the churches which they planted, none will deny it. But then, I demand where he finds this power appropriated to them, be|cau&s;e they were Apo&s;tles? If the churches which they planted, had Elders ordained in them, that &s;ervice mu&s;t be performed by them, for this plain rea&s;on, that there was no body el&s;e there to do it.&mdash;But what evidence does this afford, that the power of ordination was peculiar to them?</P>
<P>Again, Timothy and Titus, had directions given them for ordaining, and they doubtle&s;s did ordain; and there is as much to be &s;aid of the power of ordination being appropriated to them, as to Paul and Barnabas. But here, Reverend Doctor, flinch not; but &s;peak full to the ca&s;e. Will you a&s;&s;ert that Ti|mothy and Titus, were as truly Apo&s;tles as Paul and Barnabas were? Should you a&s;&s;ert that they were really Apo&s;tles, in the proper &s;criptural &s;en&s;e of the word, you know that the public, to whom you have appealed, will laugh you to &s;corn. But if you in&s;i&s;t, that they were not Apo&s;tles, you give up your whole argument, about the appropriation of the power of ordination. How does it appear that the other Apo&s;tles, James, Peter, &amp;c. had the power of ordination, &s;ince there is no mention made in the &s;cripture, that they ever did ordain? Or how does it ap|pear, that the Elders which Timothy and Titus ordained, had not the power of ordination committed to them, as well as the other branches of the mini&s;terial work? The &s;ilence of the &s;cripture about it, is no evidence at all in the ca&s;e. What hint is there in the whole &s;acred canon, that the power of ordination is appropriated to any particular order? Yea, is not the repre|&s;entation of the &s;cripture, f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll in oppo&s;ition to the&s;e appropria|ting notions? For the ordinations mentioned in the &s;cripture, were performed, &s;ome by Apo&s;tles, &s;ome by Pre&s;byters and Teachers, &s;ome by Evangeli&s;ts, and &s;ome by the laying on of the hands of the Pre&s;byters. Upon the whole then, all that does, or can appear from the &s;cripture, is no more than this: "That it is by the religious rite of ordination, that a man becomes ve&s;ted with mini&s;terial authority." But as to the power of ordination, being appropriated to a particular &s;uperior order; it is &s;o far from being countenanced by the &s;cripture, that it is contrary to the &s;cripture-repre&s;entations, to &s;uppo&s;e, that there is more than one order in the go&s;pel mini&s;try.</P>
<P>Thus then it appears, that what the Dr. pretends to be the chief argument to prove the di&s;tinction of Bi&s;hops from Pre&s;by|ters, is a mere empty &s;ophi&s;tical flouri&s;h of words, fraught with &s;ound, but de&s;titute of &s;en&s;e, extracted from the very dregs of that un&s;criptural, ab&s;urd, antichri&s;tian, papi&s;tical dogma, "That
<PB N="272" REF="011212_0141_0F862E45A1FCE1C8">the Bi&s;hop may communicate his power, in &s;ome degree, to Pre&s;byters and others, as he &s;hall think proper."</P>
<P>The Dr. proceeds to add, "Becau&s;e &s;ome eccle&s;ia&s;tical offices, are never performed by the clergy in common, but only by &s;uch of them as are particularly ordained for tho&s;e purpo&s;es, it is evident that tho&s;e who are thus ordained and empowered, are admitted to a different and higher order." The &s;ame logick &s;till. A mere barefaced begging of the que&s;tion. Where does he find the&s;e particular ordinations? He &s;till treads the &s;ame circle; alternately proving the one by the other. I mu&s;t here enquire, were the Apo&s;tles thus particularly ordained for the pur|po&s;e of ordination? If &s;o, how came Timothy and Titus who were not Apo&s;tles, to have this power? Or, was Timothy parti|cularly ordained to this office? If &s;o, how does it appear? The Dr. will perhaps &s;ay, that Timothy did ordain, and therefore had the power of ordination committed to him. But this is nothing to the purpo&s;e.&mdash;The thing to be proved, is, that there was &s;ome|thing peculiar in Timothy's ordination, empowering him to ordain others, which was not common to the ordination of every Pre&s;by|ter. Here the Dr. can have no eva&s;ion, but only his former dogma. "That the Bi&s;hop may communicate his power in &s;ome degree, to Pre&s;byters and others, as he &s;hall think proper." But I a&s;k, who &s;ays the Bi&s;hop may do this? Does the &s;cripture &s;ay &s;o? Or has there ever been any body who &s;aid it, be&s;ides Dr. Chand|ler and the Pope?</P>

<P>THERE is an unhappy Perver&s;ene&s;s in the Di&s;po&s;ition of &s;ome Men, which will never &s;uffer them to be contented them&s;elves, and engages them to di&s;turb the Peace of others. The mo&s;t beautiful Sy&s;tems either appear di&s;agreeable to them or they endeavour to repre&s;ent them &s;o to others. In &s;ome Mea&s;ure they &s;eem to claim the Pity, but in a greater to de&s;erve the Indignation of good Men. The American Whig
<PB N="275" REF="011212_0142_0F862E466DD82520">appears to be of this Character, from his Productions, and e&s;|pecially from his 17th Numb, wherein he aims a Blow at that Pillar of the Con&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uction the Fall of which, he mu&s;t be con&s;ci|ous would be attended with the mo&s;t fatal Con&s;equences. <Q>The Church of England (&s;ays Dr. Chandler,) in its external Polity, is &s;o happily connected and interwoven with the civil Con&s;titution, that each mutually &s;upports and is &s;upported by the other.</Q> Again&s;t this Po&s;ition he levels his Paper; I &s;hall therefore offer in this Day's Lucubration, &s;ome Arguments in its Defence, and draw them from that Repre&s;entation of the external Polity of the Church of England, given us by the Whig in the Paper under Con&s;ideration. <Q>If the State (&s;ays he) derives Happine&s;s and Support from the Church, or if the civil Con&s;titution harmonizes with it, this Happine&s;s, this Support, this Harmony, mu&s;t be evinced in one or more of the following Particulars. Fir&s;t, That the King is, by Law, the &s;upreme Head of the Anglican Church. Secondly, That he has the Appointment of all the Spiritual Lords in the Realm. Thirdly, That tho&s;e Lords make a Part of the Legi&s;lature of Great-Britain. Fourthly, That they are au|thorized to hold &s;piritual Courts in England, for puni&s;hing Offenders again&s;t the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Law. Fifthly, That the King has Authority <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o &s;ummon the Convocation, and to per|mit them to make Canons.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e I &s;hall con&s;ider in Succe&s;&s;ion, as they are plac'd. Fir&s;t, The King's Supremacy is a Prerogative right in it&s;elf, and ad|vantageous to the State. 'Tis a ju&s;t Privilege re&s;ulting from the Alliance between Church and State The civil Magi&s;trate, for the Benefit of the Common Wealth, de&s;ir'd an Union be|tween it and the Church. To effect this, the Church deprived her&s;elf of her natural Independency, and relied on the Protec|tion of the State, which was due to her for the Advantages which it would receive from her Influence in its Favour: Con|&s;equently the civil Magi&s;trate mu&s;t have a ju&s;t Superiority, as that which protects is always more powerful than that which is protected. This Prerogative is al&s;o both ju&s;t and beneficial,&mdash; for without it the Form of Government, and the Rules of Wor|&s;hip, might be altered, and tho&s;e Doctrines corrupted, for the Sake of which the State entered into this Alliance. As Reli|gion, in the Opinion of the wi&s;e&s;t Legi&s;lators, is the main Sup|port of Government; and as the pure&s;t, both in external Polity, and internal Structure, is be&s;t adapted to advance the Intere&s;ts of the State, it follows undeniably that it is an e&s;&s;ential Privi|lege in the civil Magi&s;trate, after he has cho&s;en a Church which he deems pure&s;t, and on which he has confer'd Powers of being
<PB N="276" REF="011212_0143_0F862E47B68371C0">&s;erviceable to continue its Utility, by &s;uffering no Alterations to be made without his Con&s;ent.</P>
<P>By this Prerogative the King is enabled to an&s;wer the End aimed at by the A&s;&s;ociation. He &s;ees that tho&s;e Principles are in&s;tilled into the Minds of the People, which are favourable to Society. He can take care that none &s;hall be appointed Teach|ers in the Church taken under his Protection, but tho&s;e who will deliver its Doctrines uncorrupted to his Subjects. Di&s;orders in Government demand &s;peedy Remedies. Tho&s;e he could not readily obtain from Religion, if the Church was independent of his Power; but, as its &s;upreme Head, he can demand its &s;tronge&s;t Exertions in the Cau&s;e of the State, and can him&s;elf extend their U&s;efulne&s;s. By this conditional Subordinancy of the Clergy, tho&s;e Evils al&s;o are avoided, which proceed either from an ab&s;olute State of Dependance, or from an Indepen|dency. Ab&s;olute Dependance would make them mere Engines in the Hands of the Prince, and would probably rai&s;e him to a Tyrant. While from an Independency would ari&s;e &s;uch woful Di&s;orders as are vi&s;ibly attendant on the Papacy, in tho&s;e King|doms where the civil Magi&s;trate is a mere Tool to the Church.</P>
<P>This Prerogative tends likewi&s;e to create a Reverence and Veneration for the Prince, as Head of two Bodies united, and Defender of their religious as well as civil Privileges: A Re|verence extremely well adapted to engage his Subjects to a ready and cheerful Obedience. To e&s;tabli&s;h a Church without giving the civil Magi&s;trate a Supremacy, would be the direct Method of con&s;tituting an <HI>Imperium in imperio,</HI>&mdash;a Charybdis, which every wi&s;e Common Wealth will avoid, if po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Secondly, Equally nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful is that Branch of the Supremacy, which the Whig next mentions, viz. <Q>That the King has the Appointment of all the &s;piritual Lords in the Realm.</Q> For &s;ince He has confer'd Honours and Powers on the Church (in Con&s;equence of the Union) to make it more &s;er|viceable to the State, he ought certainly to be po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of a Power of choo&s;ing tho&s;e Per&s;ons whom he judges be&s;t capacitated for the public Good. Not that he has a Power of making Bi&s;hops; for this is inherent in the Church as a religious So|ciety; but only of directing where, and by whom, this Office &s;hall be exerci&s;ed. By this Means the State is &s;ecured from the Evils which might flow from the ambitious Intrigues of Church|men; If, independent of the Authority of the King, they could arrogate to them&s;elves tho&s;e Powers which were given for the public Service; and in&s;tead of this Danger, has a Pro&s;pect of &s;eeing the&s;e Offices well fill'd by the Magi&s;trates who&s;e Aim mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Good of the whole Community.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="011212_0143_0F862E47B68371C0">Thirdly, That the Bi&s;hops make a Part of the Legi&s;lature of Great-Britain, is a Privilege beneficial to the Government, and ju&s;tly claimable by the Church. For &s;ince, to effect an Union, &s;he has given up her Independency, and &s;uffers the State to de|cide in Affairs relating to her as a Society it is rea&s;onable that &s;he &s;hould have her Agents or Repre&s;entatives in the Legi&s;lature, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould &s;uffer by her Kindne&s;s, and Laws be enacted pre|judicial to her Intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>Their Advice and A&s;&s;i&s;tance in any Thing re&s;pecting Church Affairs more e&s;pecially, we cannot but &s;uppo&s;e to be very u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary; for common Rea&s;on dictates, that tho&s;e Men mu&s;t naturally be be&s;t acquainted with the Affairs, which their Func|tions engaged them to &s;tudy, and in which they have continually employed them&s;elves. From this Conjunction of the Lords Spiritual and Tempor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> this Advantage al&s;o ari&s;es,&mdash;that the People will con&s;ider the Laws as more binding, when enacted by the concurrent Judgment of their religious and civil Supe|riors. Neither do I imagine it would be impolitical to give Prelates a Seat in Parliament, if it were only to &s;trengthen the &s;econd Branch of the Legi&s;lature, which needs confe&s;&s;edly their Support. Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e al&s;o, for this Rea&s;on, was it to connect the Pre|lates and Lords Temporal together, that, in a wicked Admini|&s;tration, the Prelates might oppo&s;e any Mea&s;ures detrimental to the Church, and the others ob&s;truct any ambitious Schemes of the Clergy.</P>
<P>The fourth Particular is, That they are authorized to hold Spiritual Courts in England, for puni&s;hing Offenders again&s;t the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Law. Spiritual Courts are only formed and employed for the Service of the State. However the Enemies of our happy Con&s;titution may harrangue on eccle&s;ia&s;tical Power and Tyranny, as if a Dominion was u&s;urp'd by the Bi&s;hops for their own Purpo&s;es, it is evident that the&s;e Courts were e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s an aid to the Civil, to remedy tho&s;e Evils which the Civil either could not take Cognizance of or could not remove. It is certain a wi&s;e Legi&s;lature would not have erected them, if it had not &s;uppo&s;ed them beneficial, and it is no le&s;s certain that Bi&s;hops receive this juridical Authority, not as inherent in their Office, but as a Sword to be wielded in the Cau&s;e of their Country.</P>
<P>If they have abu&s;ed their Power, let them be called to ac|count like other bad Officers of the Common Wealth;&mdash;if the Courts them&s;elves are found to be detrimental to the Public, let them be aboli&s;hed. But, as it has never yet been propo&s;ed to have any &s;uch con&s;tituted in America, I &s;hall di&s;mi&s;s the Argu|ment, as altogether impertinent to the Ca&s;e of introducing Bi&s;hops into this Country.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="011212_0144_0F862E4862B091C8">Fifthly, What has been &s;aid of the King's Supremacy in ge|neral, makes it unnece&s;&s;ary to expatiate on this Branch of it: Suffice it to &s;ay, that if the King had not a Power of &s;ummon|ing the Convocation, and permitting them to make Canons, when Accident, Oppo&s;ition, or &s;ome Circum&s;tances dangerous to the Church and State, if not obviated, demanded it, his Su|premacy would lo&s;e one of its mo&s;t energetic Parts. Add to this, that by a Power of di&s;&s;olving when he &s;ees proper, he can obviate tho&s;e Di&s;advantages re&s;ulting from long, frequent, and controver&s;ial Convocations, which, in many &s;uppo&s;eable Ca&s;es, might be attended with pernicious Con&s;equences.</P>
<P>Thus have I briefly enumerated &s;ome of the Advantages ob|tained, and Di&s;advantages avoided, by the pre&s;ent happy Com|bination of Church and State.&mdash;The State &s;upports and pro|tects the Church, and the Church exerts its &s;alutary and mo&s;t effectual Influence in the Service of the State; thus, (agreeable to Dr. Chandler's Problem) <Q>They mutually &s;upport and are &s;upported by each other.</Q></P>
<P>It would take up more Space than the Limits of this Paper allow, to animadvert on all the futile Objections and Mi&s;repre&s;enta|tions in the tedious Number before me:&mdash;However, I hope I have &s;ufficiently evinced the Truth of the Dr's. Po&s;ition,&mdash;To his frequent A&s;&s;ertions, "that "The King is ab&s;olute Monarch of the Church." I think no Reply more &s;uitable than the Words of the &s;age Hooker, who was confe&s;&s;edly acquainted intimately with the Laws Civil and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical, and had the Honour of the highe&s;t Commendation from Locke him&s;elf, that illu&s;trious Ma&s;ter of rea&s;oning. <Q>Our Laws have with much Certainty pre&s;cribed Bounds into each Kind of Power. All Deci&s;ions of Things doubtful, and Correction of Things ami&s;s, are proceeded in by order of Law, what Per&s;on &s;oever he be un|to whom the Admini&s;tration of Judgment belongeth. It is neither permitted unto Prelates nor Prince to judge and de|termine at their own Di&s;cretion, but Law has pre&s;crib'd what both &s;hall do. What Power the King hath, he hath it by Law, the Bounds and Limits of it are known; the entire Community giveth general Order by Law, how all Things publickly are to be done, and the King as the Head, the highe&s;t in Authority over all, cau&s;eth according to the &s;ame Law, every particular to be framed and ordered thereby. The whole Body Politic maketh Laws, which Laws gave Power unto the King; and the King having bound him&s;elf to u&s;e according to Law that Power, it &s;o falleth out, that the Execution of the one is accompli&s;hed by the other in mo&s;t re|ligious and peaceable Sort. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hocker's Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Polity.

<P><PB N="279" REF="011212_0144_0F862E4862B091C8">I &s;hall fini&s;h this Paper with a few Ob&s;ervations pertinent to the Subject.</P>
<P>Whoever examines, or even &s;uperficially &s;urveys and compares the Government of the Church and State, will find a beautiful Harmony and Concordance, &s;uch as no other Society can pro|duce. The Subordinancy of Powers in each, and the Re&s;em|blance in their three E&s;tates, advance a mutual Regard and Ve|neration and E&s;teem in the People for each. The Dignities like|wi&s;e confer'd on the Bi&s;hops, mu&s;t be very in&s;trumental in e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ci|ting tho&s;e Principles of Honour which are &s;o favourable to a Monarchy. Add to this, that Per&s;ons of the highe&s;t Rank,&mdash; Brothers of Kings, and Noblemen by Birth, have added Lu&s;tre to the Office,&mdash;&s;o that the mo&s;t eminent Per&s;onages think it an Honour to them, by entering into this Station, to promote the Intere&s;t of Religion and their Country. The Pre&s;byterian Prin|ciples or Form of Government, cannot, with any Ju&s;tice, be &s;et in Competition with it, as they maintain a perfect Equality, and cannot boa&s;t that Antiquity, or illu&s;trious De&s;cent, &s;o agree|ble and nece&s;&s;ary to Honour.</P>
<P>It may be accounted likewi&s;e no &s;mall Te&s;timony in favour of the Efficacy of Prelacy in the Engli&s;h Government, that the Enemies of the State have ever tried to di&s;parage it; and Oliver Cromwell, (when he aimed at the De&s;truction of Monarchy,) prov'd by his Conduct, that <Q>he imagined the Extirpation of Prelacy the &s;ure&s;t way to effect his diabolical Purpo&s;es.</Q></P>
<P>It is highly nece&s;&s;ary that a Church which is e&s;tabli&s;hed by the State, &s;hould have &s;ettled Articles of Doctrine, Creeds, &amp;c. that the civil Magi&s;trate may judge of their Propriety,&mdash;that he &s;upport not dangerous Principles, and that the People may have a public and uniform Method of In&s;truction. Her public Wor|&s;hip mu&s;t be precompos'd and &s;tated, that he may in&s;pect it, and judge what will be mo&s;t beneficial for the common Weal. To &s;uch Methods and Practices the Principles adopted by the Pre&s;byterians are oppo&s;ite, and tho&s;e of the Church mo&s;t favour|able; and con&s;equently it mu&s;t be be&s;t intitled to an E&s;tabli&s;h|ment by the State.</P>
<P>The Number of Members al&s;o which the Church compre|hends in it, renders it more fitting for an E&s;tabli&s;hment. Tho' the motly Troops which gather under the Standard of Pre&s;byte|riani&s;m may now &s;eem to be numerous,&mdash;yet if it were to be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, and con&s;equently certain Principles to be agreed on, tho&s;e ravenous Devourers, who only join'd with her in her Op|po&s;ition to the Church, would turn their full-mouth'd Bowlings at her; and &s;he would be left, as in the Times of Oliver, to cea&s;e from the Attempt, or be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">orn to Pieces by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e who for|merly herded with her.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="011212_0145_0F862E4F27138E28">The Advantages which are deriv'd to us from the Labours of the Prelates, like tho&s;e which i&s;&s;ue from Temporal Superiors, by the remotene&s;s of their Sphere e&s;cape the public Attention, and for that Rea&s;on receive not that Gratitude which is due to them. Very ill therefore does He de&s;erve of his Country, who not only neglects to pay them that Tribute of Prai&s;e which their Services demand, but endeavours to rob them of that Share of Acknowledgment which the Public might be di&s;pos'd to give them. When we con&s;ider likewi&s;e, that in the Confir|mation of the great Charter, and in the Charter it&s;elf, and in the Body of the Engli&s;h Laws, the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical are &s;o inter|woven with the civil Rights, that a Di&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">union cannot be effected without Danger to the Whole; when we con&s;ider this, I &s;ay, we cannot but doubt of that Man's Affection to his Country, who endeavours to le&s;&s;en a Reverence for the Wi&s;dom of the Legi&s;lature, and a Love for any Part of the Con&s;titution.</P>

<P>SO &s;acred are the rights of truth, and of con&s;cience, that it argues a con&s;iderable degree of meanne&s;s of &s;pirit, to vio|late them, even for the pre&s;ervation of life it&s;elf, Nay, to mi&s;|repre&s;ent things in a jocular romantic way for the diver&s;ion of others, common as it is, among the lower &s;ort of people, is no &s;mall immorality: It di&s;covers a trifling temper of mind, with a want of a due tenderne&s;s of con&s;cience, a proper regard to truth and religion.&mdash;But to a&s;&s;ert a fal&s;ehood with great &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and &s;olemnity, is doubtle&s;s a notable aggravation of the crime, and renders this &s;in, in the beautiful language of &s;crip|ture, exceeding &s;inful. This practice of deceit and fal&s;hood, is in the meane&s;t of men, but is e&s;teemed more criminal in gen|tlemen of di&s;tinction and learning. Hence to give &s;uch a per&s;on the lie, is accounted the greate&s;t indignity and &s;eldom fails to kindle a proportionable re&s;entment.</P>
<P>A clergyman is con&s;idered not only as a Man of honour, but of religion and piety; and by his office appointed to reprove the
<PB N="281" REF="011212_0145_0F862E4F27138E28">vices of others, and to be a preacher of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s. It mu&s;t therefore be &s;till more atrocious in him to take up the bu&s;ine&s;s of mi&s;repre&s;entation and duplicity. So far as any of them are guilty of this &s;candalous offence, they practically deny them&s;elves to be the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, who is the faithful and true witne&s;s, and inli&s;t them&s;elves under the banners of Satan, who was a liar from the beginning. Hence it is that among the many things which are ju&s;tly looked upon as exceptionable in high church, and her mi&s;&s;ionaries in the colonies, there is none that gives greater offence, and rai&s;es more di&s;gu&s;t again&s;t the prelatical faction, than that want of varacity for which they have rendered them&s;elves &s;o remarkable, and tho&s;e methods of deceit, mi&s;repre&s;entation and calumny, which they too con&s;tant|ly pur&s;ue.&mdash;They may pretend what they will, about hav|ing all the power, and being the only mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, and greatly zealous for the only church he has in the world: But can any &s;ober man who really believes the Bible, &s;eriou&s;ly think that to be the cau&s;e and kingdom of Chri&s;t, which he &s;ees &s;o principally founded in, and con&s;tantly promoted by impo&s;ition and artifice? Was the religion which the mi&s;&s;ionaries profe&s;s much more exceptionable than it is, they might notwith&s;tand|ing be ju&s;tly entitled to the charitable opinion of mankind, did they but pur&s;ue fair and hone&s;t mea&s;ures to promote it. But &s;ince they are guilty of &s;uch gro&s;s di&s;ingenuity, in pro&s;ecuting their &s;cheme, they mu&s;t, to every upright and candid per&s;on, acquainted with their mea&s;ures, appear in the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable colours. How inexpre&s;&s;ibly odious then, mu&s;t be their conduct in the &s;ight of that God who loves truth and uprightne&s;s in the inward parts.&mdash;Truly affecting mu&s;t it be, to every &s;erious per&s;on to think what account &s;uch men will be able to give of their conduct in the great day of judgment, when all their &s;pe|cious di&s;gui&s;es and falacious colourings &s;hall vani&s;h, and the naked truth of things appear.</P>

The terms are general and indefinite, "tho&s;e people in tho&s;e regions." Not only one region, colony or pro|vince, but all in general, Tho&s;e People in tho&s;e Regions.</P>
<P>But was there are any foundation in truth and fact, for &s;uch a repre&s;entation of the inclinations of the Americans? Directly the rever&s;e. Nothing can be further from the truth, though it was &s;igned by the clergy and ve&s;tries, and al&s;o by &s;ome governors. For &s;ome governors have not di&s;dain'd to become the tools of the epi&s;copal clergy, in order to avail them&s;elves in their turn, of the dirty in&s;trumentality of the gown and ca&s;&s;ock. Dr. Chandler and his mi&s;&s;ionary brethren, when it becomes nece&s;&s;ary for them, to inform their employers how laborious and &s;ucce&s;sful they are, frequently repre&s;ent in their letters, the church of England to be in a growing &s;tate, and that &s;he has been greatly increa&s;ing; and this I believe, they have con&s;tantly done both before and &s;ince the year 1714, when this addre&s;s was made to the throne. He tells us, p. 88. <Q>Whatever notions the Di&s;&s;enters in this country may have formerly entertained concerning the church, yet of late years they have greatly come off from their preju|dices; and &s;entiments of candour, charity and moderation, have vi&s;ibly taken place.</Q>&mdash;And yet not with&s;tanding th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the prejudices of Di&s;&s;enters, as he ab&s;urdly calls them, in the colonies again&s;t the church of England, are &s;o greatly re|moved, there are but very few in America who de&s;ire a Bi&s;hop at this pre&s;ent period. The general a&s;&s;emblies of the Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts-Bay and Connecticut, which are by far the large&s;t of the N England colonies, have in&s;tructed their Agents to remon|&s;trate again&s;t an American epi&s;copate. Nor does it appear that the people of the other colonies are more de&s;irous of &s;uch a &s;pi|ritual Lord to rule over them. It &s;hould &s;eem from all the public appearances and the be&s;t intelligence that can be obtained, that there is &s;carcely one in a thou&s;and of the inhabitants of the Briti&s;h colonies, who really de&s;ire an American Bi&s;hop. There are on the contrary, thou&s;ands and ten thou&s;ands, who dete&s;t the project as much as they did the late &s;tamp act, and look up|on an American epi&s;copate to be a more tremendous evil, and more certainly calculated to deprive us of our liberty, and re|duce us to the wor&s;t and mo&s;t infamous kind of b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ndage.

<P>I am greatly mi&s;taken if Dr. Chandler be not guilty of con|tinuing this mi&s;repre&s;entation of the colonies, as fal&s;e and di&s;in|genuous at it is. He had repre&s;ented in the former part of his appeal, the great importance and nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ending Bi&s;hops to the colonies, in &s;uch a rue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ul and pathetic manner, that he &s;eems to have been afraid, the warmth of his imagination had tran&s;ported him too far, that he had overacted his part, and that his repre&s;entations might afford grounds for &s;undry objections a|gain&s;t the character of his &s;uperiors, for not &s;ending Bi&s;hops long ago, &s;ince the call for them was &s;o extremely urgent, and indeed if but one half of what he &s;ays upon the great excellency, nece&s;&s;ity, importance and u&s;efulne&s;s of an American epi&s;copate to the colonies, the church, the Negroes and Indians, were true, it would reflect &s;ignal reproach on the Engli&s;h Bi&s;hops at home, for being &s;o remi&s;s and negligent in endeavouring to pro|cure us this mo&s;t momentous ble&s;&s;ing: As this might therefore give them great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">brage, our appellant, after having conjured up a real gho&s;t, while he was pur&s;uing his ideal ble&s;&s;ing a Bi|&s;hop, found it nece&s;&s;ary to try to lay him again. Among other things, which he &s;ays in an&s;wer to this &s;hrewd objection, he ob|&s;erves, that, <Q>the colonies were generally &s;ettled by private ad|venturers; and &s;ome of them by tho&s;e who had an aver&s;ion to epi&s;copal government. The propriety of not &s;ending a Bi&s;hop to colonies of the la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">er &s;ort, will be di&s;puted by none." P. 47.</Q></P>
<P>This pa&s;&s;age would &s;eem at fir&s;t view, a generous conce&s;&s;ion, and a full acknowledgment that there would be no propriety in &s;ending a Bi&s;hop to the colonies, northea&s;t of Maryland, be|cau&s;e it will be difficult to prove with &s;atisfactory evidence, that the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of the&s;e colonies had not in general an aver&s;ion to epi&s;copal government; &s;o many of them having been har|ra&s;&s;ed and per&s;ecuted in a mo&s;t cruel and barbarous manner, by the&s;e eccle&s;ia&s;tical tyrants, who were a di&s;grace to the reforma|tion, and the greate&s;t plagues to the church and nation. And it will be difficult to prove, that this aver&s;ion is eradicated, &s;ince a va&s;t majority of the pre&s;ent inhabitants, the po&s;terity of tho&s;e per&s;ecuted refugees are filled with abhorrence of all &s;uch Bi|&s;hops,
<PB N="284" REF="011212_0147_0F862E5236B756E8">upon the review of the many oppre&s;&s;ions and barbarities which their forefathers for a long cour&s;e of years &s;uffered from their mercile&s;s hands. In this view the pa&s;&s;age quoted from the Doctor, would breathe a very noble and Chri&s;tian &s;pirit: For in this ca&s;e agreeable to the &s;ociety's inference from the &s;uppo|&s;al of our being inclined to have a Bi&s;hop, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat this was the voice of God, it may with equal propriety and &s;trength of rea|&s;on be inferred that the general and great aver&s;ion to Bi&s;hops in the colonies, is the voice of God, that none &s;hould be &s;ent here. Why is not their &s;trong aver&s;ion to American prelates, as divine an argument again&s;t them, as their inclination for them would be, e&s;pecially &s;ince the aver&s;ion is real and general, and their inclination, bating only the convention and a few zealots, fal&s;e and imaginary.</P>
<P>But this cannot po&s;&s;ibly be the Doctor's meaning, in the pa&s;|&s;age under con&s;ideration, becau&s;e &s;uch a declaration would con|fute the whole of his appeal, and the &s;even famous petitions; &s;ince the appeal and the petitions, make application for Bi&s;hops for the&s;e very colonies, that have the greate&s;t aver&s;ion to prelacy. We mu&s;t then &s;earch for another meaning to this pa&s;&s;age, and tho' it is one of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages in which the author found it ne|ce&s;&s;ary, not to &s;peak out fully, but to leave eliptical, rather im|plied than expre&s;&s;ed, for very obvious rea&s;ons, to mince and &s;mooth it over with much artifice; yet it is not very difficult to &s;upply the elip&s;is, and di&s;cover the true &s;en&s;e by comparing <Q>it with &s;ome other pa&s;&s;ages, viz. "That tho' the&s;e colo|nies were &s;ettled by tho&s;e, who had an aver&s;ion to epi&s;copal government, and there would have been no propriety in &s;ending Bi&s;hops to them while this remained; yet this being now chiefly removed, the pre&s;ent inhabitants in general, hav|ing conformed to the church of England, there is now not only the greate&s;t propriety, but even a nece&s;&s;ity that they &s;hould be immediately &s;ent to the&s;e colonies to confirm this wonderful conver&s;ion to epi&s;copacy.</Q></P>
<P>That this is the true and only con&s;i&s;tent &s;en&s;e of the pa&s;&s;age under con&s;ideration, I think may be demon&s;trably proved, from the following pa&s;&s;age. "Whatever notions the Di&s;&s;enters in this country may have formerly entertained, concerning the church; yet of late years, they have have greatly come off from their prejudices."&mdash;In the former part of this century, the num|ber of American clergy and profe&s;&s;ors of the church.&mdash;was &s;mall and incon&s;iderable in compari&s;on with the amount of their pre&s;ent number.&mdash;And even then, he tells us with &s;eeming approbation, the clergy ve&s;tries, and governors of provinces,
<PB N="285" REF="011212_0147_0F862E5236B756E8">&s;igned petitions or addre&s;&s;es, &s;etting forth, that it was the in|clination of the people in the colonies to have an American Bi|&s;hop, which they looked upon to be the voice of God approving the &s;cheme. Now when he had thus told us from the authori|ties of the clergy, the ve&s;tries and the governors of provinces, that the inclinations of the people in the American regions, were to have Bi&s;hops among them, fifty years ago; and that the pro|fe&s;&s;ors of the church of England, were &s;mall and incon&s;idera|ble then in compari&s;on with the amount of their pre&s;ent num|ber, what can any &s;tranger to America conclude, but that they are all in general conformed to the church?&mdash;Accordingly he has repre&s;ented in his appeal, that the profe&s;&s;ors of the church of England in America, are about a million who complain for want of bi&s;hops. <Q>Will not, &s;ays he, then the complaints of near a million of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, who are &s;uffering under the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> unprecedented hard&s;hips, with regard to their religion, be regarded and procure the redre&s;s of &s;o intolerable a griev|ance?</Q> Now if there are million in America, who belong to the church of England, certainly &s;he has increa&s;ed in a mo&s;t amazing manner, and other denominations mu&s;t have unaccount|ably decrea&s;ed, and dwindled away comparatively to almo&s;t no|thing. But who that has any tolerable acquaintance with America, and the numbers of the various denominations, does not know this calculation of the Doctor, to be a mo&s;t gla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing mi&s;repre&s;entation of facts? It is a&s;toni&s;hing that he &s;hould have no greater regard for his public reputation, than to &s;tuff his ap|peal with &s;uch &s;triking fal&s;ehoods, entrenched as he may flat|ter him&s;elf to be, within the authority of the clergy, ve&s;tries and governors of provinces. For how many &s;uch authorities will be &s;ufficient to convert a notorious fal&s;ehood, into an important and &s;erious truth? To have reque&s;ted a Bi&s;hop at all, &s;ince he is likely to prove &s;o injurious to the civil and religious liberties of the colonies, would have been highly unrea&s;onable, but to report that we are de&s;irous of &s;uch an opp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;&s;ion, is at once to en&s;lave and in&s;ult us.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF I ju&s;tly remember, both you and your Antagoni&s;t, the Ame|rican Whig, in &s;ome of your preliminary Numbers, promi&s;ed to relieve your Readers, when tired of the <Q>Dry Cru&s;t of Controver&s;y,</Q> by now and then throwing into your Papers &s;omething &s;prightly and entertaining. This Engagement, I confe&s;s, has been pretty well comply'd with on your own Part: But the Whig &s;eems utterly to have forgotten his Promi&s;e; unle&s;s he goes upon the old Maxim, <Q>That he who acts by another, acts by him&s;elf.</Q> On the Strength of This, per|haps he may fondly hope to ju&s;tify his Procedure; as it is more than probable that Sir I&s;aac Foot, writes his Kick by Whiggi&s;h Direction,&mdash;mo&s;t palpably under Whiggi&s;h Influence.</P>
<P>However, as the Knight &s;eems to have &s;unk into total Ne|glect, (if peradventure any Regard was ever paid to his Babble|ments and Buffoonery,) I think it incumbent on his Ma&s;ter, who I will pre&s;ume is &s;omewhat more attended to, at length to give us &s;ome Specimens of that Wit and Humour, which here|tofore, it has been &s;aid, gained him &s;ome &s;mall Reputation: Tho' from what I have &s;een, heard, and under&s;tood, at lea&s;t Five Eights of it were given him by the good Nature of the Public; &s;everal &s;pirited Performances in the ludicrous Style, having been fathered on Him, tho' they were in Reality the Offspring of &s;ome other Parent; which it &s;eems, the Gentleman's &s;uper|lative Mode&s;ty would not &s;uffer him to di&s;avow. But, be that as it may, I &s;hould be glad that either He, or &s;ome of his A&s;&s;o|ciates, (for I cannot but &s;uppo&s;e that he has &s;ome &s;uperior to Sir I&s;aac,&mdash;I cannot but &s;uppo&s;e (a Suppo&s;ition, Mr. Tickle, which he has not made in your Favour) that &s;ome Men of Gen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s may be &s;ound among the Variety of Writers that are engaged in his Paper) I &s;ay, I &s;hould be glad that &s;ome of the Conf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">de|racy would give us a few Strokes of that Humour (&s;till avoiding all per&s;onal Reflections) with which, "I am told," he has long

<P>I know you have declared, that you look upon Sir I&s;aac as below your Notice, or even your contempt; and I do a&s;&s;ure you, that unle&s;s I was convinced in my own Mind that you really thought him &s;o, I never &s;hould have di&s;honoured my&s;elf and my Profe&s;&s;ion, by writing to you upon the Occa&s;ion.

<HEAD>To the AMERICAN WHIG.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AMONGST all the various devices that have from time to time been formed by tho&s;e who a&s;pire to lord it over God's heritage, there probably never was a more pernicious &s;cheme concerted for the de&s;truction of our religious liberties, than that of e&s;tabli&s;hing an epi&s;copate in the American plantations. It mu&s;t therefore be matter of rejoicing to every &s;erious mind, that the advocates for this ruinous project, appear daily more and more cre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t-fallen and dejected; while its oppo&s;ers increa&s;e in number, and are manife&s;tly victorious in argument.&mdash;Nay, &s;o far &s;uperior to the little juncto, that are engaged in forging chains for a free and loyal people, that I doubt not, but mad wit' de&s;pair, and raving with di&s;appointment, having already long &s;ince abandoned all pretence to rea&s;on and argument, they will within the &s;pace of two months, contract their forces to a competent number for forming a circle round a fire &s;ide, and vent their <HI>ultima ratio Jacobitorum,</HI> as they u&s;ually do, that is, in cur&s;ing the Whigs, and drinking to the re&s;toration of a Tory admini&s;tration. But however promi&s;ing, the pro&s;pect of their &s;peedy and total defeat; I think we &s;hould not rely on an arm of fle&s;h. If not &s;o much as a &s;parrow falls to the ground, without the will of our Heavenly father, how much more ought we to eye the di&s;pen&s;ations of providence, in a matter &s;o mo|mentous to our mo&s;t ine&s;timable privileges. I would therefore draw my encouragement of &s;ucce&s;s, from a devout con&s;ideration of the rea&s;ons we have for &s;uppo&s;ing that the great di&s;po&s;er of events is on our &s;ide. And if he be for us, who &s;hall be again&s;t us?</P>
<P>It has ju&s;tly been ob&s;erved by divines, that what we generally call &s;econd cau&s;es, are not cau&s;es in &s;trict propriety of &s;peech; and what we call the laws of nature, are only certain rules and methods, by which the great ruler of the world generally pro|ceeds
<PB N="294" REF="011212_0152_0F862EFEA109AC10">in tho&s;e of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ons, which fall under our cognizance: Nay, that the right notion of the divine omnipre&s;ence will greatly a&s;&s;i&s;t us, in forming a ju&s;t apprehen&s;ion of the nature of that providence, which re&s;pects not only the great events, but the minute&s;t circum&s;tances of every the &s;malle&s;t action and event in the world: Even that providence, by which "the very hairs of our heads are all numbered." That though the providence of God pre&s;ides over, and governs all things, it has a peculiar influence upon all the great events that happen to men, and e&s;pecially in re&s;pect of &s;uch, wherein the fate of a whole people is involved. And that the&s;e are effected by the Deity's inclining the hearts of men, in a way con&s;i&s;tent with rational agents, to accompli&s;h the purpo&s;es of his will, and by controuling the de&s;igns, or infatuating the coun&s;els of tho&s;e who act again&s;t his divine prede&s;tinations. Thus we frequently find, that he terrifies bad men, with &s;trange amazements, to di&s;cover their own con&s;piracies, and to fall into the &s;nares which they &s;e|cretly laid for others.&mdash;Agreeable to this, the &s;acred oracles inform us, that <Q>he fru&s;trate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h the tokens of liars, and makes diviners mad; turneth wi&s;e men backward, and maketh their knowledge fooli&s;h.</Q> I remember an excellent remark of the pious Mr. Matthew Henry, in his comment on the conduct of Rehoboam, who like the Bi&s;hop of Landaff, had been advi&s;ing with a parcel of hot-headed &s;triplings. <Q>God, &s;ays he, often fulfills the coun&s;els of his own wi&s;dom, by infatuating men, and giving them up to the coun&s;els of their own folly. No more needs be done to ruin men, and to leave them to them|&s;elves, and their own pride and pa&s;&s;ion.</Q> Let us examine the mad conduct of our diviners, and trace their con&s;piracy by this rule, and we &s;hall find great rea&s;on to thank God for the comfortable hopes, that he is by a &s;trange concurrence of exter|nal cau&s;es, about making their knowledge fooli&s;h. The world had hitherto been impo&s;ed upon by the &s;pecious pretences of a certain &s;ociety, who had &s;ecretly been preparing the way for an epi&s;copate in America, by introducing mi&s;&s;ionaries into this country, to pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">elyte the different denominations of Chri&s;tians to epi&s;copacy. This being done under colour of converting the Pagans to Chri&s;tianity, was &s;o far from giving umbrage at home, that thou&s;ands of Di&s;&s;enters, yearly contributed to the apparent, without &s;o much as conjecturing about the true and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a|tent de&s;ign. And this &s;cheme, tho' &s;u&s;pected by &s;ome among us, yet being only &s;u&s;pected, might have been pro&s;ecuted for years to come, without affording any &s;atisfactory evidence in reality. Such being the ca&s;e, who could have imagined, that a man en|gaged in this very plot, and who mu&s;t certainly have known that
<PB N="295" REF="011212_0152_0F862EFEA109AC10">its &s;ucce&s;s depended on its being kept a &s;ecret, till another cen|tury had matured it for execution, &s;hould, in the mo&s;t public manner, divulge it thro' the nation; than which nothing in the world could more contribute to mar and ruin it.</P>
<P>But being &s;mitten with the &s;plendor of an American Bi&s;hop|ric, which notwith&s;tanding the incredible fu&s;tian about a primi|tive Bi&s;hop, is intended to out&s;hine the incon&s;iderable lack-ca&s;h &s;ee of Landaff, his Lord&s;hip under the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing infatua|tion declares, <Q>This point obtained [the mi&s;&s;ion of Bi&s;hops to the Colonies] the American church will &s;oon go out of its infant &s;tate, be able to &s;tand upon its own legs, and without foreign help, &s;upport and &s;pread it&s;elf." "Then the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of this &s;ociety will have been brought to the happy i&s;&s;ue intended.</Q></P>
<P>Nor is the finger of God, le&s;s di&s;cernable in his Lord&s;hip's (who is by many &s;uppo&s;ed to be the prelate they had fixt their eye upon, or rather rai&s;ed their eyes unto) di&s;covering &s;uch ex|treme virulence again&s;t the non-epi&s;copalians in this country, as mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily rou&s;e them to a greater oppo&s;ition than perhaps they would otherwi&s;e have given.</P>
<P>I proceed now to &s;hew the rea&s;ons we have to conclude, that the providence of God is about confounding the mea&s;ures of the&s;e men by the &s;triking in&s;tances of infatuation in the conduct of Dr. Chandler, all tending to defeat the very project he was en|deavouring to promote.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. He appears &s;en&s;ible, that whatever were his private &s;en|timents about the religious denominations, not of his own com|munion; it was but common prudence, not to affront them in an affair in which he &s;eems de&s;irous, if not of their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, at lea&s;t of them neutrality. Actuated by this principle, he has in &s;ome parts o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his pamphlet treated them with &s;uch marks of re&s;pect, as nothing but the mo&s;t ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity could have extorted from a per&s;on of his bigotted turn. And yet in other parts, he appears &s;o unaccountably infatuated, as to repre&s;ent them, tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> could &s;erve no imaginable purpo&s;e, and is flatly contrary to truth, as <Q>&s;ounding the trumpet of &s;edition, and being di&s;affected to the civil e&s;tabli&s;hment.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2d. Tho' he confe&s;&s;es it altogether unnece&s;&s;aay to his pur|po&s;e, to in&s;i&s;t on the divine right of epi&s;copacy; yet hath he openly avowed &s;uch an attachment to the Jure Divino of dioce&s;an Bi&s;hops, as (&s;uppo&s;ing his illogical &s;yllogi&s;ms to be conclu&s;ive) to unchurch, and con&s;equently to affront the whole body of Chri&s;tians in America, except tho&s;e of his own commu|nion, and his good friends in Canada.</P>
<P N="3">3d. He declares, that he only de&s;ires a harmle&s;s primitive
<PB N="296" REF="011212_0153_0F862EFF645FE3C0">Bi&s;hop; and on gaining credit to this declaration, the &s;ucce&s;s|ful pro&s;ecution of his &s;cheme principally depends, and yet he has rendered it totally impo&s;&s;ible to gain any man's belief, by giving more than bare intimations, that as &s;oon as his party have &s;ufficient power and influence, they will procure legi&s;lative acts, to aggrandize the American hierarchy, and exalt this pri|mitive Bi&s;hop into as great a Lord &s;piritual, as ever wielded the epi&s;copal &s;taff in England; and now pretends to be affronted for being di&s;believed, this &s;elf-contradiction notwith&s;tanding</P>
<P N="4">4th. Confounded by the &s;ame infatuation, he publi&s;hed an adverti&s;ement in which he &s;peaks with the highe&s;t contempt of Whig principles, tho' a per&s;on of half his abilities mu&s;t have known, that nothing could be more fatal to the &s;ucce&s;s of his &s;cheme, than the di&s;covery of a Tory bia&s;s, in the reign of a Prince who&s;e royal progenitor was advanced to the throne on Whig principles, immediately after a &s;cheme had been concerted in the reign of the Doctor's beloved Queen Anne, the great pa|trone&s;s of an American epi&s;copate, for introducing the Pretend|er, "For America &s;ays he, has Whigs." Who that was not under a providential infatuation in order to be finally di&s;appoint|ed, would have ventured to ri&s;k the &s;ucce&s;s of his cau&s;e, on &s;o ill-timed, as well as wretched a wittici&s;m, when he knows, that bating &s;ome of his own party, and the papi&s;ts in Mary|land, he might &s;earch the continent with a lanthorn for a diffe|rent character, as Diogenes did Athens for a man, and be baulked in his &s;earch.</P>
<P>I am farther induced to conclude, that God is determined to bring their coun&s;els to nought, and to make the devices of the&s;e people of none effect, on con&s;idering &s;ome remarkable and pro|vidential occurrences in the conduct of the convention, as that their malevolent calumnies on as obedient and loyal a people, as any Prince upon earth could ever boa&s;t, &s;hould, notwith&s;tanding their &s;tudied &s;ecrecy, be &s;o &s;oon divulged. <Q>So that tho' they &s;hot in &s;ecret and encouraged them&s;elves in an evil matter, and communed of laying &s;nares privily, &s;aying who &s;hall &s;ee them, a bird of the air carried the voice, and that which hath wings di&s;covered the matter.</Q> That they &s;hould ap|point a per&s;on to conciliate the good graces of the non epi&s;copa|lians, who, from his narrow principles, they mu&s;t have known, could not po&s;&s;ibly write with temper on the &s;ubject of epi&s;copacy. Nor while contemplating this his grand idol, refrain from u&s;ing tho&s;e whom he mo&s;t non&s;en&s;ically calls Di&s;&s;enters, with indig|nity and in&s;ult,&mdash;That they &s;hould notwith&s;tanding his invi|tations of all objectors to propo&s;e their objections, no &s;ooner find an opponent, than determine to treat him with the mo&s;t unpa|rallelled
<PB N="297" REF="011212_0153_0F862EFF645FE3C0">&s;currility; and in order weekly to abu&s;e him, retain in their &s;ervice, a brace of reverend blunderbu&s;&s;es, who in the lan|guage of Milton, are lower than the lowe&s;t; and by that means exhibit the cleare&s;t demon&s;tration of that very &s;pirit, which, tho' at pre&s;ent, harmle&s;s and de&s;picable for want of power, the continent &s;o greatly and &s;o ju&s;tly apprehends, when armed with the temporal powers of a Bi&s;hop, which will enable them to carry it into the mo&s;t dreadful and unrelenting execution.&mdash; And finally, that of all the members of the convention (among whom there mu&s;t doubtle&s;s be &s;ome men of ability and temper) they &s;hould depute &s;uch a genius as Mr. I-gl-fs, to preface and correct their laborious defence of a defamatory &s;er|mon; and after having decluded a poor credulous creature by their mo&s;t malevolent mi&s;repre&s;entations, render him &s;till more ridiculous, by the &s;lander and fal&s;hoods, inter&s;per&s;ed through their vindication.</P>
<P>From the&s;e ob&s;ervations on the conduct of providence, re&s;pect|ing this intere&s;ting affair, I think we may conclude that it does not &s;eem at pre&s;ent agreeable to the divine will, to give &s;ucce&s;s to the mea&s;ure; and that notwith&s;tanding the great demerit of our &s;ins, we &s;hall not be cha&s;ti&s;ed for them, with the particular puni&s;hment meditated by the convention; but that he who hath from time to time delivered us from the mercile&s;s de&s;igns of am|bitious and unrea&s;onable men, and &s;till brings to light the hid|den things of darkne&s;s, and hath pre&s;erved to us our religion and liberty, in de&s;pite of all the malicious and re&s;tle&s;s attempts of our adver&s;aries, will al&s;o in his infinite mercy, re&s;cue us from that tremendous de&s;truction which was ready to devour us.</P>

The fir&s;t, (which Dr. <HI>C.</HI> him&s;elf has half given up) has often been confuted! the 2d. re&s;ts on an ab&s;urdity, viz. that religious &s;entiments are capable of delegation: and the 3d. regards the <HI>out&s;ide,</HI> as what principally recommends a &s;acrifice to Heaven.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHEN we &s;ee Men, in any public Debate, carefully avoid|ing to enter into the Merits of the Cau&s;e, but loud, vio|lent, and tedious in dwelling upon Circum&s;tances; we naturally infer that they are con&s;cious, either of their own per&s;onal In|&s;ufficiency, or of the Badne&s;s of their Cau&s;e. This Reflection has been already &s;ugge&s;ted, not le&s;s than 500 Times, by the American Whig and his "Underling" Scribblers.</P>
<P>I propo&s;e at this Time to con&s;ider the two Papers in the Ame|rican Whig, (Numb. XVIII, XIX) upon the general Subject of Epi&s;copacy, &s;ign'd Dordracen&s;is. Who Dordracen&s;is is, I know very well. <HI>Faenum habet in Cornu.</HI> But why he &s;igns him&s;elf thus, I know not. If he means thereby to intimate his Appro|bation of the Proceedings of the Synod of Dort, it is not much to his Credit. For, as a very ma&s;terly and candid Writer ob|&s;erves, <Q>the Synod of Dort was convened in Malice, and pro|tected in Policy, and came not to examine the Truth, but to puni&s;h the Remon&s;trants; them&s;elves acknowledging that they came not to di&s;pute, but condemn.</Q> <HI>Ad judicandum quippe, non ad di&s;putandum, Se conveni&s;&s;e aiebat Synodus.</HI> Acta. &amp;c. Pref. P. 5. I doubt not but many who &s;ub&s;cribe to, and approve of the Doctrines then and there e&s;tabli&s;hed, hold in Abhorrence the Conduct of that Synod.</P>
<P>But as I was going to &s;ay: I know Dordracen&s;is, what he
<PB N="301" REF="011212_0155_0F862F0228D896B8">is&mdash;what he has been&mdash;and what he lately would have been, if he could. You may &s;ay, What is all this, to the Purpo&s;e of an|&s;wering his Papers on the Subject of Epi&s;copacy? I reply, that it is, and I will maintain it to be, as much to the Purpo&s;e, as his Papers on Epi&s;copacy are to the Purpo&s;e of the grand Point in Debate.</P>
<P>Dr. Chandler thought proper to introduce the Subject of American Bi&s;hops with a brief Sketch of the Arguments in Fa|vour of Epi&s;copacy, and an Explanation of the Epi&s;copal Office, according to the Doctrine and Belief of the Church of Eng|land; in Order to &s;hew, that, upon the Principles of the Church, Ordination, Confirmation, and a regular Government of the Clergy cannot be exerci&s;ed in America, for Want of Bi&s;hops. It was thought that a brief Explanation of the&s;e Points was not improper, to enable tho&s;e, who are Strangers to our Princi|ples, to judge of the great Di&s;advantages and Hard&s;hips the American Church of England is under, while without an Epi&s;|copate. For the only fair Way for Men to judge of this Ca&s;e is, to con&s;ider it upon the Principles of the Church, and not of tho&s;e who differ from it. Accordingly the Author of the Ap|peal very ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, that whether we are right or wrong in our Principles of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Polity, our Plea for American Bi&s;hops is equally valid; for no Plea of this Kind can be founded on the ab&s;olute Truth of Principles, but on the Be|lief of the Truth of them. It is evident therefore, that an At|tempt to overthrow the Doctrine of Epi&s;copacy as maintained in the Church of England, can make no Part of a regular Oppo|&s;ition to the Propo&s;al of American Bi&s;hops; and that it is as foreign from the proper Point in Debate, as a tedious Examina|tion into the Colour of a Cow, or the Length of Her Horns, in a Di&s;pute concerning her legal Proprietor.</P>
<P>However I propo&s;e briefly to con&s;ider what Ma&s;ter Dordra|cen&s;is has offered on the Subject, and to tru&s;s up his two Pa|pers together, like a Brace of "Snipes;" for verily, gentle Reader, like Snipes they are, being, altho' long-leged, yet &s;mall|bodied. His fir&s;t Paper con&s;i&s;ts altogether of Pre&s;umptions, alias pre&s;umptive Arguments again&s;t Epi&s;copacy.</P>
<P N="1">1. His fir&s;t pre&s;umptive Argument is, "that the Reformers, when they rejected the Errors of Popery, rejected with it Epi&s;|copacy." I am &s;orry, if this Writer believes his own A&s;&s;ertion, that he has been &s;o gro&s;sly mi&s;informed. None of the Reform|ers ever rejected Epi&s;copacy on the Footing of its being an In|novation in the Church; but &s;ome of them were obliged to depart from it, as they have often lamented, on Account of the Re&s;traints of the civil Power. As to Pre&s;byteriani&s;m, Bp. Bur|net,
<PB N="302" REF="011212_0156_0F862F0379372BC8">never blindly prejudiced again&s;t its Di&s;ciples, has &s;hewn it to have been originally a political Engine of popi&s;h Invention.</P>
<P N="2">2. "All the pre&s;ent Churches, except that of England, di&s;|claim Epi&s;copacy." This is &s;o far from being true, that mo&s;t of them enjoy it; and the re&s;t of them wi&s;h for it, if there is any Truth and Sincerity in their Declarations. I could produce in|numerable Documents in Proof of this; but I will content my|&s;elf with a &s;ingle one, which is recommended to the peculiar Attention of Dordracen&s;is. It is taken from the Church of Holland in the Synod of Dort. Bp. Carleton, a Member of the Synod, informs us, that having made a public Prote&s;tation again&s;t Pre&s;byteriani&s;m and in Favour of Epi&s;copacy, be told the Divines of that Synod in a Conferrence, that the Cau&s;e of all their Troubles was becau&s;e they had no Bi&s;hops, &amp;c. To this they an&s;wered, <Q>That they had a great Honour for the good Order and Di&s;cipline in the Church of England, and heartily wi&s;hed they could e&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves upon this Mo|del; but they had no Pro&s;pect of &s;uch a Happine&s;s; and &s;ince the civil Government had made their De&s;ires impractica|ble, they hoped God would be merciful to them.</Q> As to the ancient Walden&s;es and Albigen&s;es, here cla&s;&s;ed under the Head of pre&s;ent Churches, I affirm, upon the mo&s;t valid and unexceptionable Authority, again&s;t this Writer, and tho&s;e who have deceived him, that they were &s;trictly and properly epi&s;copal.</P>
<P N="3">3. His next pre&s;umptive Argument again&s;t Dioce&s;an Epi&s;co|pacy is, "that many of the brighte&s;t Lights in the Nation (mean|ing by this Metaphor, the Di&s;&s;enters) cannot in Con&s;cience con|&s;ent to it." But a better pre&s;umptive Argument for it is, that a far greater Number of as bright Lights in the Nation, cannot in Con&s;cience reject it. If indeed there are many poor Pre&s;byte|rian Mini&s;ters, who would find their Advantage in conforming to the Church, but choo&s;e rather to forego it, tho' I que&s;tion whether there be many &s;uch; this may be allowed to be a Proof of their Sincerity, but cannot be admitted as an Evidence of the Truth of their Notions. The Engli&s;h Papi&s;ts make a much greater Sacrifice of wordly Advantages than they; and con&s;e|quently, upon the Plan of this pre&s;umptive Argument, offer a much &s;tronger Proof in Favour of Popery.</P>
<P N="4">4. <Q>Epi&s;copacy &s;eems not &s;o con&s;i&s;tent with the Genius of the Go&s;pel, and the Humility it &s;o &s;trictly inculcates, as the Scheme of an Equality among&s;t Mini&s;ters.</Q></P>
<P N="5">5. "It is more apt to &s;well proud Ambition," i.e. not humble Ambition. I put the&s;e two pre&s;umptive Arguments together, becau&s;e in Reality they are no more, and ought not to count more than One. And if it proves any Thing, it proves too
<PB N="303" REF="011212_0156_0F862F0379372BC8">much; namely, that the Superiority of the Twelve over the Seventy&mdash;of the Apo&s;tles over the Elders,&mdash;and perhaps of Chri&s;t him&s;elf over his Apo&s;tles, was incon&s;i&s;tent with the Genius of the Go&s;pel. The &s;ame Kind of Argument in the Mouth of a Republican (I hope Dordracen&s;is is not one) would as conclu&s;ively prove, that there ought to be no Superiority of Office in the State, nor in our Fleets and Armies. Dordracen&s;is here tells us, as we have been told a thou&s;and Times by others, with equal Pertinence, of Diotrephes who loved the Prehemi|nence. Now what a &s;ad Fellow was this &s;ame Diotrephes? I believe him to have been a mo&s;t ambitious, irregular Man; and the learned Dr. Hammond has unan&s;werably proved him to have been a Pre&s;byterian. <Q>Diotrephes, &s;ays he, was not ordained to any Office of Power, in the A&s;ian Church,&mdash;but of him|&s;elf, without any Mi&s;&s;ion, nay expre&s;sly again&s;t the Apo&s;tles' Con&s;ent, was willing to a&s;&s;ume and exerci&s;e this Power; and is but an Example of Korah's Sedition and pre&s;umptuous Humour; and that is inevitably the Ca&s;e of the Pre&s;byte|rian,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="6 7">6, and 7. The&s;e two Arguments again can count but One; and they tend to prove (&s;o far as Arguments upon the Weather-Cock E&s;tabli&s;hment, turning round and round, can have any particular Tendency) that no Man, either in Church or State, ought to be entru&s;ted with, or to undertake, the Government of others.</P>
<P N="8">8. The la&s;t pre&s;umptive Argument here again&s;t Dioce&s;an Epi&s;copacy is, that <Q>&s;everal Bi&s;hops, &amp;c. of the Church of England, have them&s;elves di&s;avowed the divine In&s;titution of it.</Q> And here we are told of Cranmer, and others, and are referred to Stillingfleet's Irenicum, in Support of a long String of Mi&s;repre&s;entations. But does not Dordracen&s;is know, if not I now tell him, that the Irenicum is no Authority, and is looked upon by the Advocates for Epi&s;copacy as no Evidence, in the Ca&s;e before us. None can have a greater Veneration for the Charac|ter of Bp. Stillingfleet than I have. I believe him to have been one of the greate&s;t Scholars and be&s;t Men of his Age; and I never wi&s;h to &s;ee any Men higher in their Principles, than that mild and excellent Prelate. At the &s;ame Time I do not &s;cruple to declare, that I look upon his Irenicum to have been a ha&s;ty, indige&s;ted and partial Account of Principles and Facts. And in this the good Bi&s;hop would not have blamed me; for when he had examined Matters more thoroughly, he looked upon it in the &s;ame Light him&s;elf. His De&s;ign in writing, appears to have been a good one; which was, in general, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in compo&s;ing the religious Differences that then tore the Nation in Pieces,
<PB N="304" REF="011212_0157_0F862F03E21C2998">and particularly, in Order thereto, to demoli&s;h the <HI>Jus Divinu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> of Pre&s;bytery. But his Zeal carried him, as it often carried others, into an Extreme. It repre&s;ented Things to him thro' the Medium of Prejudice; but it was not long before he was able to correct his Mi&s;takes, and to form a very different Opi|nion, both of Principles and Per&s;ons. He wrote his Irenicum at the Age of 24, and did not &s;cruple to condemn it him|&s;elf afterwards, declaring, <Q>That there are many Things in it, which if he were to write again, he would not &s;ay; &s;ome which &s;hew his Youth, and want of due Con&s;ideration; others, which he yielded too far, in Hopes of gaining the Di&s;&s;enting Parties to the Church of England.</Q> As to Cran|mer, he was once a Papi&s;t; afterwards a Prote&s;tant; and be|fore he died, as good a Churchman as almo&s;t any of his Succe&s;|&s;ors.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid more than enough, in an&s;wer to the pre&s;umptive Arguments in the Papers before me, and their Invalidity is no bad pre&s;umptive Argument of the Invalidity of the Cau&s;e they are made u&s;e of to &s;upport. I &s;hall now proceed to the &s;econd Paper, wherein Dordracen&s;is undertakes to <Q>produce po&s;itive Proofs from the New-Te&s;tament, again&s;t Dioce&s;an Epi&s;co|pacy.</Q> But his po&s;itive Proofs amount in Number to no more than a &s;ingle one, at which he labours through the bigger Part of his Paper; and what he produces farther than this, cannot, by the greate&s;t Stretch of Courte&s;y, be allowed a higher Title than that of pre&s;umptive Arguments.</P>
<P>The po&s;itive Proof is taken from the Ordination of Timothy; on which one In&s;tance, aided by po&s;itive A&s;&s;ertions, Dordracen|&s;is is obliged to re&s;t the whole Weight of his Cau&s;e. And what Proof it is will be &s;een pre&s;ently. <Q>If there had been, &s;ays he, one In&s;tance in the &s;acred Scripture, of a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;|pel, ordained to his Office, by the Impo&s;ition of a Bi&s;hop; how greatly would the Epi&s;copalians have triumphed in &s;uch a Ca&s;e? I think therefore, as there is an In&s;tance of a proper Ordination to the mini&s;terial Office, recorded in the New-Te&s;tament, which is &s;aid to have been done by the laying on of the Hands of the Pre&s;bytery, the Point ought to be given up.</Q> His In&s;tance of Pre&s;byterian Ordination, as I have ob&s;erved, is that of Timothy, to whom St. Paul &s;ays in his fir&s;t Epi&s;tle to him, <Q>Neglect not the Gift which is in thee, which was given thee by Prophecy, with the laying on of the Hands of the Pre&s;bytery.</Q> I will allow that this Pa&s;&s;age relates to the Or|dination of Timothy, and that the Hands of the Pre&s;bytery were impo&s;ed in his Ordination. But &s;till, Evidence is wanting to prove that the Word Pre&s;bytery was intended to convey the
<PB N="305" REF="011212_0157_0F862F03E21C2998">Ideas, which are affixed to it by our modern Pre&s;byterians. It is farther ob&s;ervable, that the Office is &s;aid to have been per|formed, not by, but with the laying on of the Hands of the Pre&s;bytery; which is a feeble Expre&s;&s;ion, and I believe has never been u&s;ed, in any other In&s;tance, to &s;ignify the actual Conveyance of Authority. Upon an In&s;pection therefore of the Pa&s;&s;age, two Difficulties immediately offer them&s;elves: One is, to &s;ettle the Meaning of the Word Pre&s;bytery; the other is, to account for the Expre&s;&s;ion, "with the laying on of Hands." Now the only proper Way of clearing up the&s;e Points, is to compare the Ca&s;e with other In&s;tances of the like Nature in Scripture, if any are to be found. And upon Inquiry it will appear, that there are various other In&s;tances of Ordination recorded in the New-Te&s;tament, in each of which the Office was performed by tho&s;e who were &s;uperior to Pre&s;byters. An impartial Inquirer will therefore endeavour to explain the Pa&s;&s;age in &s;uch a Manner, as to render it con&s;i&s;tent with the known Practice of the Apo&s;tles. That there are &s;everal Ways of doing this, Dordracen&s;is knows; he is plea&s;ed to call them Eva&s;ions, but giving har&s;h Names is one of the ea&s;ie&s;t Ways of getting clear of Difficulties. I do not at pre&s;ent contend for any parti|cular Interpretation, but approve of any which the Expre&s;&s;ions will bear, if it can be reconciled with that Sy&s;tem upon which the Apo&s;tles evidently acted; and I in&s;i&s;t upon it, that every Interpretation, which is irreconcileable therewith, is fal&s;e, and ought to be rejected</P>
<P>I have &s;aid no more than what, I imagine, the fir&s;t In&s;pection of the Pa&s;&s;age under Con&s;ideration would naturally &s;ugge&s;t to a Mind dive&s;ted of Prejudices; and this, of it&s;elf, is &s;ufficient to guard Men again&s;t the novel Interpretation of the Pre&s;byterians. But for our farther Security, it &s;o happens, that this very Ca&s;e of Timothy's Ordination is, in another Place, mentioned by the fame Apo&s;tle, and expre&s;&s;ed in &s;uch a Manner as to afford an obvious Solution of all the Difficulties that attend the Pa&s;&s;age we have been con&s;idering. <Q>Wherefore I put thee in Remem|brance,</Q> &s;ays St. <HI>Paul</HI> in his &s;econd Epi&s;tle to him, <Q>that thou &s;tir up the Gift of God, which is in thee, by the putting on of <HI>my Hands</HI></Q> 2. Tim. i. 6. This Text. with a &s;trong Light of Evidence, bur&s;ting through the Cloud of Objections that has been rai&s;ed to darken it, as manife&s;tly refers to Timothy's Or|dination, as the other Text before-mentioned. Not &s;o, &s;ays Dordracen&s;is; and he endeavours to a&s;&s;ign Rea&s;ons. But they are &s;o poor, jejune and futile, as not to de&s;erve Notice. It is really a pitiable Ca&s;e, that our Adver&s;aries &s;hould be reduced to the hard Shift of maintaining, that the latter Text has no Relation to that Fact or Event, to which they contend that the
<PB N="306" REF="011212_0158_0F862F08712E9380">&s;ame leading Word in the other Text has an exclu&s;ive Reference! The whole Force of their Argument is, <HI>Sic nole, &s;ic jubeo, &s;tat pro Ratione</HI> No <HI>luntas.</HI> But others will take the Liberty to conclude, upon a Compari&s;on of the Two Pa&s;&s;ages&mdash;that, in the Ordination of Timothy, the Hands of the Pre&s;bytery, in whatever Sen&s;e the Word is u&s;ed, were not impo&s;ed without tho&s;e of an Apo&s;tle,&mdash;and, that the Gift therein mentioned, was confered by the Hands of St. Paul, as well as <Q>with the laying on of the Hands of the Pre&s;bytery.</Q></P>
<P>What has been &s;aid is &s;ufficient to &s;hew, that the Ordination of Timothy was not Pre&s;byterian, but Epi&s;copal; or, if Dor|dracen&s;is likes his own Phra&s;eology better, "by the Impo&s;ition of a Bi&s;hop." I had Thoughts of producing &s;everal other In&s;tances from Scripture, of epi&s;copal Ordination, which can ea&s;ily be done; but the Limits to which I am confined will not at pre&s;ent admit of it.&mdash;Dordracen&s;is &s;eems to allow that we may tri|umph, upon producing a &s;ingle one. One has been fairly pro|duced; and, to add to the Honour of the Triumph, it is the very In&s;tance on which alone he placed his Dependence.</P>
<P>Dordracen&s;is has drawn out a Number of pre&s;umptive Ar|guments, for &s;uch they are, if they can be called Arguments in any Sen&s;e, to guard the Rear of his Papers; but I am per&s;ua|ded the Reader will readily excu&s;e me from concerning my&s;elf farther with pre&s;umptive Arguments. When Dordracen&s;is undertakes, according to his Promi&s;e, to demoli&s;h Chilling-worth, as I expect to &s;ee rare Work, I propo&s;e to do my&s;elf the Plea&s;ure of attending him.&mdash;I have al&s;o &s;ome what to &s;ay to him, in due Time, on the Subject of an uninterrupted Suc|ce&s;&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD>From Mr. PARKER's GAZETTE, Dec. 5, 1768. The AMERICAN WHIG, No. XXXIX. <HI>INGLISIANA,</HI> PART I.</HEAD>
<P>MR. William Living&s;ton having promi&s;ed in the Adverti&s;e|ment prefixed to his Letter to the Bi&s;hop of Landaff, that he would acknowledge him&s;elf under obligations, &s;hould he be mi&s;taken in any the mo&s;t immaterial circum&s;tance, to the friendly hand that pointed out his error, provided the per&s;on di&s;covering his mi&s;take did it with decency and temper, and was not a&s;hamed to di&s;cover his own name; might rea&s;onably have expected, that if any of the mi&s;&s;ionaries thought them&s;elves
<PB N="307" REF="011212_0158_0F862F08712E9380">obliged to defend a man, whom in all probability them&s;elves had deluded, they would act upon equal terms; and not meanly &s;helter them&s;elves within the intrenchments of anonymous &s;can|dal. Such a &s;tep, tho' the namele&s;s author of the Vindication, thinks it "of no con&s;equence to the public who or what man|ner of per&s;on he is," was of great importance to the author of the letter; as the contrary conduct has given his antagoni&s;t an opportunity of u&s;ing &s;uch language, as no gentleman could think con&s;i&s;tent with the dignity of his character, if he appeared openly. It was moreover extremely mean, as a contrivance to di&s;able Mr. Living&s;ton from replying, without breaking his word. Thus his not an&s;wering was to be con&s;trued into a de|feat; and if he an&s;wered, they were to triumph in the viola|tion of his promi&s;e: Mean while he was to be be&s;pattered with their weekly billing&s;gate; and mo&s;t heroically dared to an&s;wer, tho' not a &s;ingle mi&s;&s;ionary cho&s;e to &s;ub&s;cribe his name to the challenge. But what mu&s;t the impartial world think of a man who indulges him&s;elf in &s;uch &s;currilous liberties, becau&s;e he flatters him&s;elf that he will not be di&s;covered. Who will know it, is the argument that prompts little minds to commit the&s;e indecencies. Secure from being detected by others, and un|awed by any &s;elf re&s;pect, they take up their vilifying pens; and thence ari&s;e tho&s;e buffooneries which are only fit for the gentry of Wapping. This however, &s;neaking as it is, has been the con&s;tant practice of this &s;et of men. Thus they treated Dr. Mayhew, who, tho' he prefix'd his name to his writings, was perpetually attacked by anonimous pamphleteers, till he laid an Archbi&s;hop upon his back, without knowing his adver&s;ary; and after being long &s;ince dead, is now re-a&s;&s;aulted in the &s;ame in&s;idious and ungentleman-like manner. Having therefore by this de&s;picable artifice, prevented the letter-writer from do|ing him&s;elf-ju&s;tice, and the Bi&s;hop of Landaff's &s;ermon, being evidently calculated to facilitate his Lord&s;hip's acqui&s;ition of an American Bi&s;hopric, and thus unque&s;tionably coincident with my de&s;ign of expo&s;ing the project of any &s;uch epi&s;copate; I &s;hall without farther apology, undertake a reply to the &s;o much cele|brated Vindication. But as I am determined never long to lo&s;e &s;ight of the main object, the Appeal, till every part of it is refu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed; I &s;hall not hold my&s;elf obliged to pro&s;ecute the &s;ubject of the Vindication, in an uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. That the reader, may however, be no lo&s;er by the interruption, I &s;hall entitle all the papers on this &s;ubject, <HI>Ingli&s;iana:</HI> and by num|bering them in the order they &s;ucceed each other, he may al|ways peru&s;e them in their connection, notwith&s;tanding the inter|vention of any other &s;ubjects, between their &s;everal numbers. In
<PB N="308" REF="011212_0159_0F862F09CD8165C0">four or five papers I hope completely to refute the Vindication, and to reduce the author (whom this notable performance, has by an incredible miracle exalted at lea&s;t a cubit above his &s;ta|ture) to his pri&s;tine dimen&s;ions.</P>
<P>Tho' this writer hath thought proper, for rea&s;ons be&s;t known to him&s;elf, to conceal his name, it is no &s;ecret, that the author of the prefatory adverti&s;ement, is the Rev. Mr. Ch-rl s I gl-s, who by this &s;tep has adopted the whole work, and thrown on him&s;elf the burden of the exculpation. Till this be done, I &s;hall accordingly treat him as the author of the Vindication. There is indeed one, and but one &s;uppo&s;ition again&s;t this pre|&s;umption; and that is, that &s;ome parts of the performance, may appear to per&s;ons not intimately acquainted with him, to be ra|ther a little above his capacity. But whatever agency that re|verend and very con&s;titutional body, the convention, may have had in the compo&s;ition, it being rather di&s;proportionate to the indu&s;try of any individual member; Mr. J-gl-s had certainly in the manner above-mentioned, made it his own. His it is <HI>de juro,</HI> let the <HI>de facto</HI> be where it will. The affair being thus far &s;ettled betwixt us, I &s;hall treat him in the progre&s;s of my reply, as re&s;pon&s;ible for the whole; and &s;o with an <HI>all ma|lice apart,</HI> proceed to the bu&s;ine&s;s. But as I find it impo&s;&s;ible immediately to enter the magnificent &s;tructure (&s;o I call the argu|mentative part) of this ma&s;ter-builder, by rea&s;on of the immen&s;e rubbi&s;h with which he has choak'd up the pa&s;&s;age; I find my|&s;elf nece&s;&s;itated to clear away the lumber, before I can introduce the reader into the man&s;ion; which, con&s;idering his hearty in|vitation to &s;urvey and examine the edifice, ought in all good con&s;cience to be done at his own co&s;ts and charges and whe|ther I &s;hall make him pay a <HI>Quantum meruit,</HI> mu&s;t be &s;ubmit|ted to the verdict of the impartial reader. Among this rubbi&s;h, I reckon what he fondly deemed wit; of which he has made &s;ome very vigorous and very aukward efforts.&mdash;But of all the deli|cate touches of humour, wherewith the Vindication, like a kind of artificial firmament, is &s;o gorgeou&s;ly be&s;pangled, commend me to the fir&s;t page of the adverti&s;ement, where he declares, that he looks for no <HI>fee</HI> or reward. And &s;o fond is he, of this pretty conceit, that in page 18 of the Vindication, he mu&s;t give it a &s;econd deliverance. <Q>The following character, of the&s;e people, &s;ays he, is given by Mr. Neal, who is their profe&s;&s;ed advocate, tho' I know not that he ever received any <HI>fee</HI> from them.</Q> That "Mr. I-gl s looked for no fee or reward," in compiling or publi&s;hing this voluminous pamphlet, is a fact known only to him&s;elf, and which therefore I &s;hall not be &s;o un|courtly as to di&s;pute with him; and the rather as he really might, in his &s;erious and humble moments entertain of the Vin|dication,
<PB N="309" REF="011212_0159_0F862F09CD8165C0">the &s;ame opinion which the beggar did of the ble&s;&s;ing of a certain Bi&s;hop, who having refu&s;ed to give him the &s;olicited groat, very munificently be&s;towed his benediction. Thus there may perhaps be a little equivocation in the matter, and tho' the gentleman may not think him&s;elf entitled to a reward <HI>ex condigne;</HI> he may expect a &s;mall recompence <HI>ex congruo;</HI> and &s;o fancy a comfortable deanery, after his Lord&s;hip's arrival, no great In|congruity. But as the word <HI>&s;ee,</HI> is in the la&s;t quotation printed in Italic, and in the fir&s;t in capitals, as tho' it was in the mo&s;t intimate alliance with the church (on which Mr. I-gl-s's printer has almo&s;t worn nine of his capital types) he undoubtedly in|tended to in&s;inuate, that Mr. Living&s;ton had wrote his letter for a fee. But the whole wit and poignancy of this &s;ublime &s;troke cannot appear in full lu&s;tre, without being made ac|quainted, that Mr. Living&s;ton is of a certain profe&s;&s;ion, which, for having more than once &s;aved this province from utter de|&s;traction, is of late, for certain political rea&s;ons, endeavoured to be rendered very unpopular. Now he being a lawyer, and lawyers being paid for &s;erving their employers (which it &s;eems is peculiar to them, all the re&s;t of mankind working for nothing) it therefore follows, that every letter they write, either for their own amu&s;ement, or to &s;erve their country or to expo&s;e the fal&s;|hoods of the mi&s;&s;ionaries, mu&s;t be in expectation of a <HI>&s;ee.</HI> But doe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Mr. I-gl-s really believe, that Mr. Living&s;ton, for the let<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er, in que&s;tion, either had, or looked for a <HI>&s;ee?</HI> I am confi|dent the reader in convinced that he does not: Why then endea|vour to appear witty at the expence of truth? Why drop an in&s;inuation &s;o injurious to his neighbour's character, and that had no relation to the matter in conte&s;t? For if it was of no con&s;equence to the public, <Q>who or what manner of per&s;on the author of the vindication was;</Q> neither was it of the lea&s;t con&s;equence, what <HI>fee</HI> or reward the Letter-writer had, or looked for. The only thing material, was the truth or fal&s;hood of what was written, and not the con&s;ideration that gave ri&s;e to the writing. Surely if every one of Mr. I-gl s's &s;ermons for which he hath received a <HI>&s;ee,</HI> were upon that account to be deemed heretical, I fear very few of them would be found or|thodox. But I am well per&s;uaded, that Mr. Living&s;ton, neither received or looked for any fee in the ca&s;e; and that if he did, Mr. I-gl-s is the la&s;t man in the world that &s;hould have re|proached him for it.&mdash;For pray what is it that this gentleman will do without fee or reward? He certainly received a <HI>&s;ee</HI> for abandoning the pari&s;h of Dover, for that of New York; and whether he had &s;tomach'd the exchange, had not the latter out-<HI>feed</HI> the former, is be&s;t known to him&s;elf. I a&s;k again, what it
<PB N="310" REF="011212_0160_0F862F0C16BE28A8">is that he will do without fee or reward? Why, he will not &s;uf|fer a man in his pari&s;h to be born or to die without it. He will neither marry nor bury without it. Yea, for that la&s;t office of humanity, the interment of the dead, this di&s;intere&s;ted and mo|ney hating gentleman will cheerfully take a fee; for without fingering the ca&s;h, he mu&s;t be caught in a &s;pecial good humour, if he will &s;end to heaven even the &s;oul of a <Q>dear brother departed.</Q> Nay, for admitting an infant into the vi&s;ible church by bapti&s;m, he has no objection again&s;t taking a fee. Thus he will not let an individual creature within his parochial juri&s;diction, come into the world, continue in it, or go out of it, without a fee; and what is beyond all toleration, the gentlemen of his fraternity, in this city, make no con&s;cience of taking fees from both &s;ides of the que&s;tion. For they are paid by tho&s;e of other communions, as well as their own. They take money from people whom they do not &s;erve, and who want none of ther &s;ervices. They receive fees for preaching even from the <HI>clergy</HI> of other denominations, who can preach for them&s;elves, and whom they are &s;o far from preaching for, that they mu&s;t, upon certain occa&s;ions preach again&s;t. The mo&s;t inglorious fee to be met with, in the whole compa&s;s of hi&s;tory! Nay, &s;o great a lover of fees is this &s;ame Mr. I-gl-s, that in conjunction with his good brother of Elizabeth-Town, (who &s;ays, he has changed his religion for a better, and no doubt from mere principle of con&s;cience, without looking for an additional fee from the &s;o|ciety) he is for procuring legi&s;lative acts, to compel the whole province to pay <HI>fees</HI> to a primitive Bi&s;hop, tho' not a twentieth part of it ever intend to become his clients The doctrine of fees, was therefore certainly not a proper topick for the di&s;play of his wit; and happy would it be for him, if any of his friends could per&s;uade him, that wit is not his principal talent.</P>
<P>But as no man is an&s;werable for not being a wit, (wit being as certainly native as religion is not) I have no controver&s;y with him on that account. But for mi&s;repre&s;entation, and fal&s;ely citing the words of his adver&s;ary, he is doubtle&s;s an&s;werable; and I think it greatly concerns his reputation to make a &s;atisfac|tory an&s;wer.&mdash;Mr. Living&s;ton, he &s;ays, tells his Lord&s;hip, <Q>That he que&s;tions whether there be a pamphlet in the nation, that in proportion to the length of the &s;ermon, contains &s;o great a number of aberrations from the truth.</Q> That is, &s;ays Mr. I-gl-s, in plain Engli&s;h, &s;o great a number of lies. But does this gentleman really believe, that there is no difference between an aberration from the truth, and a lie? If he does, I believe he is the only ca&s;ui&s;t in the world, who makes every mi&s;|take, to which human nature is incident, a lie. I have always
<PB N="311" REF="011212_0160_0F862F0C16BE28A8">under&s;tood, that a man might as well ignorantly as knowingly err from the truth, and that in the latter ca&s;e only, he was chargeable with the guilt of lying. And &s;o far is Mr. Living|&s;ton from &s;uppo&s;ing, or even in&s;inuating, that his Lord&s;hip had knowingly deviated from the truth, without which he could not be guilty of lying, that he expre&s;sly declares the contrary; and a&s;cribes his errors to the mi&s;repre&s;entations of the mi&s;&s;ionaries. How then hath he charged him with lying? But this is only one of the numerous artifices of the Vindicator to render his antago|ni&s;t odious; and de&s;erves at lea&s;t the name of a wilful mi&s;repre|&s;entation; and whether that be lying or not, we &s;hall &s;u&s;pend our judgment till we are favoured with Mr. I-gl-s's definition of that crime. But in the art and my&s;tery of fal&s;e quotation, he appears as great an adept, as tho' he had been regularly bred at the feet of the Gamaliel of Elizabeth-Town, who&s;e adulterated citations, I &s;hall make the &s;ubject of a particular paper. Mr. Living&s;ton being as well acquainted as Mr. I-gl-s with the letter from the Lord Ju&s;tices, to Lieutenant-Governor Dummer, re&s;pecting certain &s;ynodical proceedings, expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the following words, <Q>And what may appear extra|ordinary to an Engli&s;h prelate, they (that is the N. England &s;ynods) have been &s;o conducted as never to give any ju&s;t um|brage to the civil power.</Q> Now as no per&s;on can be &s;o igno|rant, as not to know the difference between ju&s;t umbrage being given and umbrage being unju&s;tly taken, by mi&s;repre&s;entation and calumny, it is evident that the word ju&s;t, was of the la&s;t importance in the pa&s;&s;age cited, and that on the praeterition of it in the quota|tion, is founded the whole &s;uppo&s;ition of the Letter-writer's er|ror.&mdash;What appears extraordinary in this, &s;ays Mr. I-gl-s, is that Mr. Living&s;ton &s;hould roundly a&s;&s;ert, <Q>their &s;ynods never gave any umbrage to the civil power.</Q> What appears &s;till more extraordinary, &s;ay I, is that he &s;hould roundly a&s;&s;ert, that Mr. Living&s;ton had &s;o a&s;&s;erted. For pray Sir, why &s;o &s;lily drop out of the above quotation, the little mono&s;yllable, ju&s;t? Is it a word particularly obnoxious to thy reverence; or did it unlucki|ly &s;tand in thy way, in a pa&s;&s;age which thou coulde&s;t not &s;uc|ce&s;sfully attack without excluding it from that company in the Vindication, in which it made a very &s;ignificant figure in the Letter? Upon what very unequal terms a man mu&s;t contend with an antagoni&s;t who can allow him&s;elf in &s;uch liberties, the intelligent reader cannot be in&s;en&s;ible; and while he loves and reveres the clergymen, on account of his &s;acred function, will naturally de&s;pi&s;e the writer for his di&s;ingenuous and contempti|ble artifice.</P>
<P>Another of this gentleman's gro&s;s mi&s;repre&s;entations is this:
<PB N="312" REF="011212_0161_0F862F0C1FFB3D98">Mr. Living&s;ton, &s;peaking of the New-England colonies, &s;ays, <Q>There is not a more virtuous, not a more religious people upon the face of the earth,</Q>&mdash;which is in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lain Engli&s;h, that in virtue and religion, no people in the world &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rpa&s;s them; and if there be any that do. I &s;hould be glad Mr I gl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s would inform the public who they are. But when the Reverend Vin|dicator comes to ob&s;erve upon this pa&s;&s;age, he repre&s;ents Mr. Living&s;ton as &s;aying, that they are <Q>the mo&s;t virtuous and reli|gious people upon the face of the earth,</Q> which in plain Eng|li&s;h, is affirming that they &s;urpa&s;s all others.&mdash;Such mi&s;repre|&s;entations do not happen by accident, and whatever this gentle|man may think, the more con&s;cientious part of mankind, who hold &s;uch practices in the highe&s;t dete&s;tation, will not con&s;ider them as ornamental to the clerical character.</P>
<P>But what has given our author the greate&s;t offence of all, is, that the Letter-writer &s;hould waft (as he calls it) the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of New-England to heaven. Let us &s;ee the ebullitions of his wrath upon this occa&s;ion. <Q>I defy the mo&s;t flaming panegyri&s;t among Catholicks, who &s;tands forth collected and tran&s;ported, to trumpet aloud the prai&s;es of &s;ome departed &s;aint, under who&s;e guardian&s;hip he places him&s;elf, and to whom he intends to pay daily and devout adoration,&mdash;to be more florid, ve|hement, lavi&s;h, lu&s;cious or extravagant in his encomiums than this gentleman is in his encomiums, on the departed &s;aints of New England.</Q> What a matchle&s;s <Q>floridity, fervidity, prodigality, mellifluity and pompo&s;ity</Q> of expre&s;&s;ion! In all my life I never knew a man &s;o much di&s;turbed at a few people's going to heaven. But let us &s;ee what hath thus tran&s;ported this peaceable mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel Mr. Living&s;ton, &s;peak|ing of the fir&s;t adventurers to New-England, &s;ays, <Q>whom we have the greate&s;t rea&s;on to believe, have long &s;ince received the approbation of their and your Lord&s;hip's final judge.</Q> This one would have thought &s;o remote from any thing like <Q>a popi&s;h canonization,</Q> a practice to which the exerci&s;es pre|&s;cribed for the "thirtieth of January," bear a much greater re&s;emblance) that one is obliged in the judgment of charity, to &s;uppo&s;e that the people whom Mr. I gl-s him&s;elf allows to have been pious, and whom he in&s;i&s;ts the Bi&s;hop of Landaff intended thus to caracterize, are now in the man&s;ions of the ble&s;&s;ed. But it &s;eems, that to believe the &s;alvation of a Pre&s;byterian &s;oul, however pious, is according to Mr. I-gl-s's creed, downright popery. To &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch a &s;pirit admitted into the realms above, is to canonize "the departed faints of New England;" and Chri&s;tian charity is popi&s;h idolatry. Methinks tho&s;e who have &s;o little that does not look like popery, &s;hould be particu|larly

But I mu&s;t notwith&s;tanding, join Mr. Living&s;ton in believing them in heaven; and happy is it for them, if they are really there, that it is not in Mr. I-gl-s's power to fetch them out.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;<HI>Tantaene animis caele&s;tibus irae?</HI></L>
<L>&mdash;"Such malevolence in prie&s;tly brea&s;ts?"</L></Q>
<P>But the Vindicator had &s;o often thumb'd over the Bi&s;hop of Landaff's &s;ermon, that he had thoroughly imbibed his Lord|&s;hip's &s;pirit, which, while revolving the above pa&s;&s;age, coming into contact with his own, in&s;tantly occa&s;ioned what the chy|mi&s;ts call an "Efferve&s;cence.

Now by tru&s;ting ju&s;t the contrary I confute his confutation, till he is pleas'd to ju&s;tify it by TRUSTING again.

<P>To this kind of Government, I am not by any particular in|tere&s;t &s;o devoted, as to think it ought to be maintained, either in oppo&s;ition to Apo&s;tolick In&s;titution; or to the much de&s;ired reformation of men's lives, and re&s;toration of Primitive Di&s;ci|pline; or to any Law or Precept of our Lord and Saviour Je|&s;us Chri&s;t: For that were to maintain a means contrary to the and: for Obedience to our Saviour is the end for which Church Government is appointed. But if it may be demon&s;tra|ted (or made much more probable than the contrary) as I verily think it may: I. That it is not repugnant to the Government &s;ettled in and for the Church by the Apo&s;tles. II. That it is as compliable with the Reformation of any evil which we de&s;ire to introduce as any other kind of Government: And, III. That there is no Law, no Record of our Saviour again&s;t it: Then, I hope, it will not be thought an unrea&s;onable Motion, if we humbly de&s;ire tho&s;e that are in Authority, e&s;pecially the High Court of Parliament, That it may not be &s;acrificed to Clamour or over born by Violence, and though (which God forbid) the greater part of the Multitude &s;hould cry, Crucify, Crucify; yet our Governors would be &s;o full of Ju&s;tice and Courage, as not to give it up, until they perfectly under&s;tand concerning Epi&s;copacy it&s;elf, <HI>Quid mali fecit?</HI></P>

<P>I &s;hall &s;peak at this time only of the fir&s;t of the&s;e three Points: That Epi&s;copacy is not repugnant to the Government &s;ettled in the Church for perpetuity by the Apo&s;tles. Whereof I conceive this which follows is as clear a Demon&s;tration, as any thing of this nature is capable of.</P>
<P><HI>That this Government was received univer&s;ally in the Church, either in the Apo&s;tles' time, or pre&s;ently after, is &s;o evident and unque&s;tionable, that the mo&s;t learned Adver&s;aries of this Government do them&s;elves confe&s;s it.</HI></P>

</DIV3>

<HEAD>SECTION VI.</HEAD>
<P>Certainly from the&s;e two great Defenders of the Presbytery, we &s;hould never have had this free acknowledgment, (&s;o preju|dicial to their own pretence, and &s;o advantageous to their Ad|ver&s;aries' purpo&s;e) had not the evidence of clear and undeniable truth enforced them to it. It will not therefore be nece&s;&s;ary, to &s;pend any time in confuting that uningenuous A&s;&s;ertion of the anonymous Author of the Catalogue of Te&s;timonies, for the equality of Bi&s;hops and Presbyters, who affirms, That their di&s;parity began long after the Apo&s;tles' times: But we may &s;afe|ly take for granted that which the&s;e two learned Adver&s;aries have con&s;e&s;&s;ed; and &s;ee, whether upon this foundation laid by them, we may not by unan&s;werable rea&s;on rai&s;e this &s;uper&s;truc|ture.</P>
<Q><HI>That &s;eeing Epi&s;copal Government is confe&s;&s;edly &s;o Ancient and &s;o Catholic, it cannot with rea&s;on be denied to be A|po&s;tolick.</HI></Q>

<HEAD>SECTION VII.</HEAD>
<P>For &s;o great a change, as between Presbyterial Government and Epi&s;copal, could not po&s;&s;ibly have prevailed all the world over in a little time. Had Epi&s;copal Government been an aber|ration from (or a corruption of) the Government le&s;t in the Churches by the Apo&s;tles, it had been very &s;trange, that it &s;hould have been received in any one Church &s;o &s;uddenly, or that it &s;hould have prevailed in all for many Ages after. <HI>Varia&s;&s;e debu|erat error Eccle&s;iarum: Quod autem apud omnes unum e&s;t non e&s;t erratum, &s;ed traditum.</HI> "Had the Churches erred, they would have varied: What therefore is one and the &s;ame

Thus Tertullian argues very probably, from the con&s;ent of the Churches of his time, not long after the Apo&s;tles, and that in matter of opinion much more &s;ubject to unob&s;erved alteration. But that in the frame and &s;ub&s;tance of the nece&s;&s;ary Govern|ment of the Church, a thing always in u&s;e and practice, there &s;hould be &s;o &s;udden <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> change, as pre&s;ently after the Apo&s;tles' times; and &s;o univer&s;al, as received in all Churches; this is clearly impo&s;&s;ible.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION VIII.</HEAD>
<P>For, what univer&s;al cau&s;e can be a&s;&s;igned or feigned of this univer&s;al Apo&s;ta&s;y? You will not imagine that the Apo&s;tles, all or any of them, made any Decree for this Change when they were living; or left order for it in any Will or Te&s;tament, when they were dying. This were to grant the que&s;tion; to wit; That the Apo&s;tles, being to leave the Government of the Churches them&s;elves, and either &s;eeing by experience, or fore|&s;eeing by the Spirit of God, the di&s;tractions and di&s;orders, which would ari&s;e from a multitude of equals, &s;ub&s;tituted E|pi&s;copal Government in&s;tead of their own. General Councils to make a Law for a general Change, for many Ages there was none. There was no Chri&s;tian Emperor, no coercive Power over the Church to enforce it. Or, if there had been any, we know no force was equal to the courage of the Chri&s;tians of tho&s;e times. Their lives were then at command (for they had not then learnt to fight for Chri&s;t) but their obedience to any thing again&s;t his Law was not to be commanded (for they had perfectly learnt to die for him.) Therefore there was no Power then to command this Change; or if there had been any, it had been in vain.</P>

<P>What device then &s;hall we &s;tudy, or to what fountain &s;hall we reduce this &s;trange pretended alteration? Can it enter into our hearts to think, that all the Presbyters and other Chri&s;tians then, being the Apo&s;tles' Scholars, could be generally ignorant of the Will of Chri&s;t, touching the nece&s;&s;ity of a Presbyterial Government? Or, dare we adventure to think them &s;o &s;trangely wicked all the world over, as again&s;t knowledge and con&s;cience to con&s;pire again&s;t it?

And if we look upon them but as mere natural men; yet, knowing by experience, how hard a thing it is, even for Policy armed with Power, by many attempts and contrivances, and in a long time, to gain upon the liberty of any one people; undoubtedly we &s;hall never entertain &s;o wild an imagination, as that, among all the Chri&s;tian Presbyteries in the world, neither con&s;cience of duty, or love of liberty, nor aver&s;ene&s;s from pride and u&s;urpati|on of others over them, &s;hould prevail &s;o much with any one, as to oppo&s;e this pretended univer&s;al inva&s;ion of the Kingdom of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the liberty of Chri&s;tians.</P>

<Q><P>Epi&s;copal Government is acknowledged to have been univer|&s;ally received in the Church, pre&s;ently after the Apo&s;tles' times.</P>

<P>OUR reverend appellant, by his own confe&s;&s;ion might have &s;aved him&s;elf the trouble of entering into the controver&s;y about the divine in&s;titution of epi&s;copacy, in a country where the non-epi&s;copalians are content with the enjoyment of their own &s;entiments, without di&s;turbing the mental repo&s;e of others, in opinions, however ab&s;urd or irrational.

Ac|cordingly he introduces the darling theme, with the humourous conceit of the uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. But as he was confident no mortal wight could refrain from &s;miling at the thoughts of &s;o ludicrous an object, we are the le&s;s obliged to the gentleman for his gracious licence to exert the mu&s;cles of our faces. <Q>Men may ridicule (&s;ays he) the uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion as they plea&s;e.</Q> And take my word for it, good Doctor, they will plea&s;e to ridicule it as often as any man is plea&s;ed to mention it. But now let us attend to what no one would have expected from &s;o zealous an advocate for human appendages. <Q>As Chri&s;t (&s;ays our author) is the great founder of the church, &s;o he is the only fountain of eccle&s;ia&s;tical authority.</Q> This is a truth to which all Chri&s;tians will readily &s;ub&s;cribe; and a pity it is, that any of them &s;hould &s;ub&s;cribe it with &s;ecret equivocations, or mental re&s;ervations. But how &s;uch a po&s;ition is con&s;i&s;tent with the principles of any man, who believes, that &s;ecular potentates as &s;uch are inve&s;ted with eccle&s;ia&s;tical autho|rity, not only to enjoin rites and ceremonies, but al&s;o matters of &s;aith, I confe&s;s my&s;elf at a lo&s;s to conceive. Did this gentle|man
<PB N="322" REF="011212_0166_0F862F0FE818CD10">really believe this fundamental maxim of the Chri&s;tian re|ligion, according to the plain and evident meaning of the words, down went all obligation of conformity to the law e&s;ta|bli&s;hed modes of Chri&s;tian wor&s;hip, like the un&s;table fabric which the fool of the go&s;pel had built on the &s;and. If Chri&s;t hath laid one foundation, pray whom hath he authorized to lay another? If he is the fountain, what have Chri&s;tians to do with the millions of rivulets that can all be traced up to eccle&s;ia&s;tical policy, and never originated from this divine &s;ource? What bu|&s;ine&s;s have they with that motly junction of king-craft and prie&s;t-craft, which hath almo&s;t bani&s;hed primitive Chri&s;tianity out of the world? Hay, it is this very per&s;ua&s;ion of Chri&s;t's be|ing the great founder of the church, and the only fountain of eccle&s;ia&s;tical authority; and their inviolable attachment to it, that has made the Di&s;&s;enters &s;uffer &s;uch grievous per&s;ecutions, for not acknowledging the divine right of epi&s;copacy, nor the u&s;urped power of Bi&s;hops, to inflict temporal pains and pe|nalties, or to illuminate the con&s;ciences of their fellow-creatures, by afflicting their bodies and picking their pockets. It is the be|lief of this, that has re&s;trained them from recognizing any man on earth as the head of the Chri&s;tian church; while the high-church <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lergy have at different times, &s;ubmitted to the infalibi|lity of an Henry and a Mary, tho' as repugnant in principle as popery and prote&s;tanti&s;m.</P>
<P>But as our author cannot find the epi&s;copacy he wants among the laws of Chri&s;t, he has at lea&s;t invented a compa&s;s by which we of the Laity are directed to di&s;cover it. <Q>Whatever general laws (&s;ays he, &s;peaking of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour) he was plea&s;ed to enjoin, mu&s;t be of indi&s;pen&s;ible obligation to all his follow|ers</Q> So far perfectly right! But in what immediately fol|lows, no prote&s;tant can po&s;&s;ibly acquie&s;ce. <Q>Indeed, with re|gard to the government of the church, his laws are expre&s;&s;ed in &s;uch general terms, that we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to tho&s;e whom he immediately entru&s;ted with the government of his church, for a more particular explanation of them.</Q> If this be not downright popery, it is exceeding difficult to determine wherein the formal nature of popery con&s;i&s;ts. For this very po&s;ition of the laws of Chri&s;t, being &s;o expre&s;&s;ed, that the Laity are unable to comprehend their meaning, is the very ba&s;is on which the whole enormous babel of the papacy is erected. For that once admitted, and an infallible head of the Chri&s;tian church is of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity. And of the two, Papa hath this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">antage of the Doctor, that it is certainly more rea|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> up our judgments to a man claiming infallibility, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to one who pretends to no &s;uch thing.

I &s;hould have drawn a very different conclu&s;ion from the generality of the laws of Chri&s;t re&s;pecting his church. I &s;hould never have ima|gined it con&s;i&s;tent with the dignity of the divine author of our religion, to expre&s;s his laws in terms my&s;tical and ambiguous, merely for the &s;ake of rendering it nece&s;&s;ary to have an <Q>unin|terrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of interpreters,</Q> to give them a more par|ticular explanation. I &s;hould have concluded, that it was to teach us not to lay too great a &s;tre&s;s on any particular form of church government; but to be furni&s;hed with a perpetual op|portunity of exerci&s;ing our forbearance and charity towards tho&s;e who differed from us in &s;entiment.&mdash;It was mo&s;t certainly not that we &s;hould make an implicit &s;urrender of our judgment and con&s;ciences in matters of religion, to any fallible, political ambitious churchman. It was not to warrant or authorize any of his followers to inflict pains and penalties on his fellow-Chri&s;|tians, for not bowing down to mitres; or believing the divine right of human ceremonies. It was not that we &s;hould worry one another like wild bea&s;ts, and even &s;hed human blood, to compel and enforce for doctrines the commandments of men. It was not in fine to convert the peaceful religion of Je&s;us into an engine of violence and oppre&s;&s;ion; or to authorize any man to challenge as a &s;ucce&s;&s;or to him, <Q>who had not where to lay his head,</Q> worldly wealth and dignitie, and tythes, and lord|&s;hips, with innumerable other appendages, which I am &s;ure the Doctor even by the help of the mo&s;t particular explanation, findeth not in the &s;acred canon. How extremely fortunate is the Chri&s;tian church, to be thus prevented from running into fatal errors about the office of a Pre&s;byter, as explained in the laws of Chri&s;t, by the particular explanation of tho&s;e unerring interpreters, the governors of the church, by whom, as by an inerrable pole-&s;tar we are directed to find the man, concealed as he is, beneath the robe and the mitre and the lawn &s;leeves of the Bi&s;hop. So open an attack on the rights of private judgment, and a doctrine &s;o manife&s;tly inducing the nece&s;&s;ity of an infalli|bility in the clergy, is what I had never expected from the pen of a prote&s;tant divine. If this arrogant claim of a particular ex|planation, and in con&s;equence of it, a right of enforcing it by compul&s;ory means, without which it is vain and ridiculous, is to be part of the Bi&s;hop's errand into this American world, the

<P>As you are already engaged in a Controver&s;y with the Ameri|can Whig, in generou&s;ly defending Dr. Chandler, and his Ap|peal, from his rude In&s;ults, and Mi&s;repre&s;entations, you would confer a &s;ingular Obligation on the Author of the Vindication of the Bi&s;hop of Landaff's Sermon, if you would al&s;o undertake the Defence of his Pamphlet, which is now attacked by the &s;ame Writer. It will ea&s;e the Vindicator of a di&s;agreeable Office, be all in your Way, and you have &s;hewn your&s;elf to be equal to the Ta&s;k; be&s;ides, you may &s;erve the Cau&s;e of Truth,&mdash; which I am convinced was your Motive when you fir&s;t engaged, &mdash;by the one as well as the other. In the mean Time, by giving a Place to the inclo&s;ed Adverti&s;ement to the Public, in your next Whip, you will oblige your con&s;tant Reader, and hum|ble Servant, <HI>The Author of the Vindication.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="to the reader">
<HEAD>Adverti&s;ement to the PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>THE De&s;ign of the Vindication of the Bi&s;hop of Ladaff's Sermon, in An&s;wer to Mr. Living&s;ton's Letter to his Lord|&s;hip, <Q>was to re&s;cue the Character of that worthy, eminent Pre|late, from the Odium which the Letter would throw upon it, and ju&s;tify the venerable Society, &s;o far as they were charged with Blame,</Q> in the &s;aid Letter. The Author of the Vin|dication profe&s;&s;ed <Q>he would &s;et about this, not as an angry Antagoni&s;t, who a&s;&s;umed a Liberty of abu&s;ing and reviling at Plea&s;ure, ju&s;t as Re&s;entment or Caprice might dictate; but as a di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate Inquirer after Truth, who de&s;ired that Per|&s;ons and Things might appear in their true and proper Light.</Q> What he undertook, he executed, by <Q>confining him&s;elf to Facts, and repre&s;enting them fairly.</Q></P>
<P>The Author appeals to every candid, unprejudiced Per&s;on, who has peru&s;ed his Pamphlet, whether he has not acted agree|able to his Engagement, and to the Character he a&s;&s;umed, of a Lover of Truth and Decency; notwith&s;tanding the many
<PB N="327" REF="011212_0168_0F862F1163DBC770">Mi&s;repre&s;entations, the unprovoked Abu&s;e and In&s;olence, with which Mr. Living&s;ton's Letter was replete.</P>
<P>As the Refutation of the &s;everal Charges contained in Mr. Living&s;ton's Letter, turned chiefly on the Inve&s;tigation of Facts, for which the Vindicator refered his Readers to the Authorities on which he related them&mdash;and as others might, if they cho&s;e it, be a&s;certained of their Truth, by turning to tho&s;e Au|thorities: He conceived it could be a Matter of no Con&s;equence to the Public, to know who, or what Manner of Per&s;on he was, Be&s;ides, he judged it improper, as well as beneath him, to ha|zard a Rencounter with a Set of &s;cribbling Janizaries, who, to mention no other In&s;tances, had &s;o gro&s;sly abu&s;ed the Candour and Moderation of Dr. Chandler, in their Attack upon his Ap|peal. From &s;uch Men, inflamed with Party Rage, and all the dark Pa&s;&s;ions which di&s;appointed Ambition generally rou&s;es, what could he expect but the &s;ame Per&s;ecution his Betters had experienced before him? For notwith&s;tanding the Invitation and Promi&s;es, contained in the Adverti&s;ement pre&s;ixed to Mr. Liv|ing&s;ton's Letter were &s;pecious; yet little Regard was due to them, con&s;idering that he him&s;elf was the principal Writer of the American Whig, to pa&s;s over his former Publications of a &s;imilar Nature. And indeed his Treatment of the Bi&s;hop of Landaff, who had prefixed his Name to his Sermon, was a &s;uf|ficient Circum&s;tance to deter any one who had not the greate&s;t Confidence in his own Patience, or who was tender of his Cha|racter, from entering into Controver&s;y with him openly, The&s;e Con&s;iderations induced the Vindicator to conceal his Name. Actuated, as he was, by a De&s;ire to &s;erve the Cau&s;e of Truth and Religion, and not to embroil him&s;elf with angry, per&s;onal Altercations, he endeavoured with all good Faith to di&s;charge what he e&s;teemed to be his Duty. If he has flung in a few Strokes of Humour now and then, they are decent, and were judged proper to keep the Reader's Attention more awake; and if he has inter&s;per&s;ed &s;everal Anecdotes thro' his Pamphlet, they were all pertinent to the Subject, had a manife&s;t Connecti|on with it&mdash;yet &s;till without any Malevolence.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that after the Vindicator had detected &s;o many Errors, and refuted &s;o many Calumnies in Mr. Living|&s;ton's Letter, the Letter-Writer's Character, as to Veracity and Probity, &s;uppo&s;ing him to have had a competent Knowledge of his Subject, did not &s;tand in the mo&s;t favourable Point of Light; for this however, he had none to blame but him&s;elf, as he fir&s;t commenced Ho&s;tilities. Yet &s;till a Way was left for him to re|treat with Honour, and exculpate him&s;elf with Reputation; making &s;ome &s;mall Abatement for his fond Credulity, The Vin|dicator,
<PB N="328" REF="011212_0169_0F862F12225AC108">after &s;eeing Dr. Chauncy's Remarks on the Bi&s;hop of Landaff's Sermon, (which was not till after he had fini&s;hed his Strictures on the Letter to his Lord&s;hip) charitably &s;uppo&s;ed that Mr. Living&s;ton had been mi&s;led by the garrulous old Gen|tleman of Bo&s;ton. This was the mo&s;t favourable Con&s;truction that could be put upon his Conduct; and indeed his Friends thought it the be&s;t Apology that could be made for him. The Vindicator was willing to think &s;o, and doubtle&s;s the Public would have admitted the Plea.</P>
<P>But, alas, how often is our Charity mi&s;taken! Some Spirits are of &s;uch a Ca&s;t, that you only make them more untractable, more &s;tubborn, by Rea&s;on. Their Ob&s;tinancy ri&s;es in Propor|tion to the Clearne&s;s and Strength of your Arguments. You cannot enrage them more, than by &s;hewing them they err, Mr. Living&s;ton was not of a Temper to make any Conce&s;&s;ions, nor even admit he was fallible. In&s;tead of making any Reparation to the Bi&s;hop of Landaff, for the injurious, groundle&s;s Calum|nies flung upon him, as Truth and Ju&s;tice demanded&mdash;in&s;tead of acknowledging he had been led into any Error by the Re|marks: He breathed out Threatnings and Vengeance again&s;t the Vindicator. His Head indeed was generally &s;uppo&s;ed to have received &s;ome little Damage by this unlucky Bounce again&s;t the Bi&s;hop. Con&s;cious of this, and that his Character, as an Au|thor, had al&s;o &s;uffered, it &s;tung him on to keener Re&s;entment. For altho' the genius of literary Fame had not given him Ad|mittance into her Train, nor even, as it is reported, heard once of his Name, Yet he paid her &s;ome di&s;tant Adoration; and to te&s;tify his Sincerity, had frequently &s;acrificed at her Shrine the trifling Con&s;iderations of Humanity, Decency, Friend&s;hip, and Truth. All the&s;e mournful, galling Reflections crowding to|gether on the Mind, were enough to transform a moderate Per|&s;on, much more our American Whig, into an Inqui&s;itor&mdash; even of Blood.</P>
<P>Accordingly, he came forth, gentle Reader, as you may per|ceive by ca&s;ting your Eye on the American Whig. No. XXXIX. &mdash;he came forth, I &s;ay, with all the tremendous Pomp of of an Inqui&s;itor&mdash;Effrontery and Su&s;picion leading the Van, In&s;olence and Malice his A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors on either Side, whil&s;t Con|demnation and fierce Revenge brought up the Rear. Thus ter|ribly accoutred and &s;upported, the Rev. Mr. I-ng-l-s became the haple&s;s, devoted Victim of his Rage. On a bare Su&s;picion that this Gentleman had written the prefatory Adverti&s;ement which is prefixed to the Vindication, he di&s;charges the whole Weight of his Re&s;entment again&s;t him, and treats him with the lowe&s;t and mo&s;t contemptible Scurrility. Surely this would not
<PB N="329" REF="011212_0169_0F862F12225AC108">be ju&s;tifiable had there been the cleare&s;t Evidence, even to De|mon&s;tration, that he had written the whole Pamphlet.</P>
<P>Mr. Living&s;ton ab&s;urdly makes this Gentleman accountable for every Pa&s;&s;age in the Vindication, at the very Time he &s;ays&mdash; "Some Parts of the Performance&mdash;are rather a little above his Capacity;" and that the Compo&s;ition is rather di&s;proportionate to the Indu&s;try of any Individual Member of the Convention," Now this I conceive to be a little hard. If the whole Conven|tion was combined to write the Vindication, why &s;hould the Blame, if perchance there is any, be thrown upon one? Yea, but Mr. I-gl-s, quoth our Whig, by writing the prefatory Ad|verti&s;ement, "has adopted the whole Work, and thereby thrown on him&s;elf the Burden of Exculpation." And Mr. Living&s;ton, &s;ay I, wrote the fir&s;t Paper of the American Whig; Is he there|fore accountable for all the Blunders, Non&s;en&s;e, Fal&s;hoods, Secur|rility, Dulne&s;s, Forgeries, bad Rea&s;oning, &amp;c. contained in the &s;ub&s;equent Papers? Would he not think it unju&s;t? The Ca&s;es are parallel. I &s;ay not this as if Mr. I-ngl&mdash;s, need be a&s;hamed to adopt the Vindication, if the Opinion of others is to be taken; but to expo&s;e the Futility of the Letter Writer's Rea&s;oning&mdash; Rea&s;oning indeed is not his Talent&mdash;as well as the Inju&s;tice of his Procedure.</P>
<P>This ungenerous Attack on Mr. I-ngl-s is the more extra|ordinary, as he is known to have always entertained the mo&s;t favourable &s;entiments of Di&s;&s;enters, particularly Pre&s;byterians, and to have been &s;o much attached to them as to incur the Cen|&s;ures of &s;ome Members of his own Community on that Account. This Attack is al&s;o extraordinary, as the Vindication, whether he was the Author or not, is, in the Judgment of every candid, di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate Reader of it, that I have conver&s;ed with, written with much Temper, and intended only to wipe off the Calum|nies that had been flung on the Church of England, and its Members.</P>
<P>Particular An&s;wers &s;hall be returned in due Time, to the Papers again&s;t the Vindication. In the mean Time, I will give the Reader a Specimen of the fir&s;t, which &s;eems to be rather in|tended as a Vehicle for private Scandal, and to fling Dirt at Mr. I-ngl-s, than a Reply to the Vindication. Mr. Living&s;ton charges the Vindicator with "fal&s;e quoting," and &s;ays he dropt the Word <HI>ju&s;t,</HI> in citing a Pa&s;&s;age from the Letter. If the Reader will be plea&s;ed to turn to the Vindication, he will find the Pa&s;&s;age at p. 24; and he will al&s;o find, to his A&s;toni&s;hment at the Whig's Effrontery, the Word <HI>ju&s;t</HI> at full Length. I &s;hall tran&s;cribe the Pa&s;&s;age for the Reader's Satisfaction from the Vindication.&mdash;"Again, he, i. e. Mr. Living&s;ton tells the
<PB N="330" REF="011212_0170_0F862F12EC0F3C60">Bi&s;hop of Landaff,&mdash;"Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Synods have ever been in u&s;e among them," i. e. the New England Coloni&s;ts," and what may &s;eem extraordinary to an Engli&s;h Prelate, they have been &s;o conducted as never to give any ju&s;t Umbrage to the civil Power." The&s;e are the Words exactly as they &s;tand in the Vin|dication, p. 24.</P>
<P>In the very next Sentence, the Mode of an&s;wering, adopted by the Vindicator, led him to repeat the Sub&s;tance of the Quotati|on, when for Brevity's Sake, &s;everal Words were omitted; and among others the Word <HI>ju&s;t.</HI> But was it not laid before the Reader in the Quotation? Or did this alter the State of the Ca&s;e? Not in the lea&s;t. The violent Proceedings of the New-England Synods gave Umbrage to the civil Power,&mdash;the Lords Ju&s;tices wrote to Governor Dummer, about them, and for|bid their meeting. The&s;e Facts the Whig cannot deny.</P>
<P>Perhaps he will &s;ay there was no ju&s;t Umbrage given to the civil Power. Yea, but who is to judge? Shall he judge for the civil Power, or &s;hall the civil Power judge for it&s;elf? Mo&s;t cer|tainly the Lords Ju&s;tices thought that ju&s;t Umbrage was giv|en, or el&s;e they would not have written to Mr. Dummer.</P>
<P>From this Specimen the Reader may judge what Sort of Re|ply the Vindication is to have. Mr. Living&s;ton affirms the Vin|dicator dropt the Word <HI>ju&s;t,</HI> tho' in Truth he quoted it; and I ob&s;erve he cautiou&s;ly avoids &s;etting down the Page of the Vindication, as few Readers may be able to remember where the Pa&s;&s;age lies, and turning to it would detect his Mi&s;repre&s;en|tation. How wretched mu&s;t the Cau&s;e be which requires &s;uch Artifices to &s;upport it? And what Kind of a Heart mu&s;t he have, that can u&s;e &s;uch Artifices!</P>
<P>Indeed this Method of an&s;wering Pamphlets by detached weekly papers, is as un&s;air as it is unprecedented, and argues want of Ability in the Writer, or el&s;e a bad Cau&s;e. It is much ea&s;ier to &s;it down and write a &s;hort, flim&s;y Piece, made up chiefly of Per&s;onal Invective and private Scandal, which will not fail to catch vulgar Ears; than to write a Pamphlet where Argu|ment and clo&s;e Rea&s;oning are nece&s;&s;ary. The Whig however, like mo&s;t Animals, knows no doubt where his Strength lies; and his Exhibitions often remind me of the Feats of Punch, placed in a Window, to draw the Rabble to &s;ee a Pup|pet Show. To do the Whig Ju&s;tice, I believe his Abilities for Rea&s;oning are much on a Level with his Courage and Heroi&s;m; as he generally makes his valiant Attacks on your pa&s;&s;ive Eccle|&s;ia&s;tics, who are re&s;trained at lea&s;t by a Regard to their Charac|ter, from making &s;uch Repri&s;als as Laymen would be apt to make, and for which he &s;eems to have no Stomach. But he
<PB N="331" REF="011212_0170_0F862F12EC0F3C60">certainly ought to have con&s;idered, before he &s;at down to ani|madvert on Characters, whether his own be invulnerable. Ac|cording to his own Doctrine, "Recrimination is ju&s;t." The Vindicator a&s;&s;ures him he will make no Return in the Way of Scandal, or raking into his private Character. As a Gentle|man, he de&s;pi&s;es it, as a Chri&s;tian he dete&s;ts it. He has no Am|bition to excel in the Manners, Flowers, or Style of Billing&s;gate, &mdash;to the Whig's more ma&s;terly Genius and Pen, he leaves &s;uch Things. But be will not be an&s;werable for what others may think proper to do with Regard to Characters.</P>
<P>After the Whig has made his fir&s;t foul Di&s;charges, it is pro|bable his Stomach may be ea&s;ier, and his Head more cool,&mdash; Evacuations being generally attended with &s;uch Effects. Should this fortune to be the Ca&s;e, and a Regard to Truth and Decency, gain the A&s;cendant a little, his Reply to the Vindication &s;hall be noticed accordingly; if not by 'Squire Tickle, yet by the Vindicator him&s;elf The Author declares he will defend the Vindication no farther than the Vindication defends Truth. If in any In&s;tance it is plainly &s;hewn, that the Vindicator was mi&s;|led, and thereby erred,&mdash;for knowingly or wilfully he erred not&mdash;he will immediately acknowledge and re|tract it.</P>
<P>But he humbly reque&s;ts the Whig, alias, Mr. Living&s;ton, that, if po&s;&s;ible, he would be decent,&mdash;that he would quote fairly,&mdash;that he would not torture Words, nor endeavour to wre&s;t them from their natural, obvious Sen&s;e,&mdash;and that he would not endeavour by Sophi&s;try, to ca&s;t a Mi&s;t before the Reader's Eyes, in order to ob&s;cure the Truth. Moreover, he &s;ubmits it to the Whig's mo&s;t &s;age Con&s;ideration, whether for his own Sake,&mdash;verily not for Mr. I-gl-s's, who&s;e moral religious Character is very well known, and above the Reach of his Malice, or that of any other Dirt-Flinger,&mdash;whether for his own Sake, I &s;ay, meaning and refering to the Whig, he &s;hould not be &s;omewhat tender and delicate when treating of private Characters. Becau&s;e, whatever be may lo&s;e in the E&s;ti|mation of &s;ome Folks, with re&s;pect to his being a frolick&s;ome, waggi&s;h Companion,&mdash;whatever Abatement there might be of the Savage Plea&s;ure which others would take in reading ca|lumniating In&s;ults on their Neighbours,&mdash;a Plea&s;ure which we are to &s;uppo&s;e the Whig never ta&s;ted&mdash;: All this will be fully made up in clear Gain to his Character, as a Gentle|man and a Chri&s;tian. Add to this, that as the Subject has &s;ome Connection with Religion, it would be quite as well to rea|&s;on more, and rail le&s;s. The Premi&s;es being complied with by the Whig, &s;hall be &s;acredly ob&s;erved by the Vindicator. Should
<PB N="332" REF="011212_0171_0F862F13A01EBF70">Squire Tickle think proper to engage, he ought to do the &s;ame; but if he deviates from them, e'en let him be kicked, or buffet|ted, or abu&s;ed, as &s;eemeth mo&s;t meet unto the meek minded Whig.</P>
<P>The&s;e Preliminaries being adju&s;ted and adhered to, Mr. Liv|ing&s;ton may proceed with his Reply as fa&s;t as he will. But he mu&s;t not think to impo&s;e on the World, by calling &s;uch Pa|pers as his XXXIXth No. which con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of &s;hamele&s;s Scolding, and mi&s;repre&s;ents two or three Words and Pa&s;&s;ages in the Vindication;&mdash;he mu&s;t not think. I &s;ay, to impo&s;e on the World by calling &s;uch Papers, An&s;wers or Replies to the Vindication. A free, &s;en&s;ible People, will di&s;cern better; they will treat with Indignation, &s;o palpable, &s;o outrageous an In&s;ult on their Under&s;tanding.</P>

<HEAD>From Mr. PARKER's GAZETTE, Dec. 19, 1768. The AMERICAN WHIG, No. XLI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the Author of the AMERICAN WHIG.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I fir&s;t took a &s;uperficial view of the celebrated Ap|peal to the Public, it appeared to be plau&s;ibly written; the author, it is evident, intended to appear in public, in the character of a man of candour and moderation. But a wolf in &s;heep's clothing, will ever find it difficult to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> long concealed. &mdash;Altho' he has been much upon the re&s;erve, it being his pro|fe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign to conciliate us to his &s;cheme of Bi&s;hops; yet an attentive reader may ea&s;ily di&s;cover what &s;pirit he is of, and with what views he is aiming at the introduction of an American
<PB N="333" REF="011212_0171_0F862F13A01EBF70">epi&s;copate. The whole tenor of his Appeal repre&s;ents every ar|gument in favour of religion, as favourable to his own &s;cheme; and that religion it&s;elf mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;ink or &s;wim, according as it &s;hall fare with his darling prelacy. It is evidently the light in which he has repre&s;ented the ca&s;e, that there can be no church of Chri&s;t in this country, nor any real Chri&s;tianity among us, in any other way than by introducing the epi&s;copal con&s;titution. The mo&s;t con&s;cientious wor&s;hip of God, and the &s;tricte&s;t profe&s;&s;ion and practice of the religion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t in the pre&s;byterian form, is, in his view of the ca&s;e, the mo&s;t brutal profligacy of manners, and equal to the highe&s;t degree of infidelity that is to be found, even among the gro&s;&s;e&s;t barbarians: Yea, that it is a &s;candalous neglect, and what brings great and de&s;erved reproach upon the civil authority of the nation, to &s;uffer us in this coun|try &s;o to continue. Indeed it was his de&s;ign, that the &s;entiments &s;hould, for the pre&s;ent, be concealed from public view; yet, (as much upon his guard as he was) his incautions pen has referred us to one who has &s;poken his &s;entiments with more freedom.&mdash; He tells us in page 10, of his adverti&s;ement. "That it gives him great plea&s;ure to find that his &s;entiments have been &s;o clearly and forcibly expre&s;&s;ed, by the right reverend Lord Bi&s;hop of Landaff, in his excellent anniver&s;ary &s;ermon preached before the &s;ociety in February la&s;t."&mdash;The &s;ermon here re&s;erred to, &s;ufficiently ju&s;tifies me in the repre&s;entation I have given of the Doctor's &s;entiments of religion. E&s;pecially in page 6, of that &s;ermon, we find the&s;e notable expre&s;&s;ions.&mdash;"Since the di&s;|covery of the new world, the &s;ame provi&s;ion hath not been made of mini&s;ters nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;upport of Chri&s;tianity, among tho&s;e who removed thither; e&s;pecially in the Briti&s;h colonies.&mdash;A &s;candalous neglect, (this, of not making a provi&s;ion of mini&s;ters) which hath brought great and de&s;erved reproach, both on the adventurers, and on the government whence they went, and under who&s;e protection and power they &s;till remain in their new habitations. To the adventurers, what reproach could he ca&s;t heavier than they de&s;erve? Who with their &s;oil abandoned their native manners and religion, and e'er long were found in many parts, living without remembrance or knowledge of God, with|out any divine wor&s;hip, in di&s;&s;olute wickedne&s;s, and the mo&s;t brutal profligacy of manners, in&s;tead of civilizing and convert|ing barbarous infidels, as they undertook to do, they became them&s;elves infidels and barbarians."&mdash;In the&s;e &s;trong expre&s;&s;ions, does the Bi&s;hop repre&s;ent our for&s;aking the epi&s;copal con&s;titution, and &s;etting up and pacti&s;ing the pre&s;byterian form of church order, to be the abandoning the Chri&s;tian religion, and living without remembrance or knowledge of God, in di&s;&s;o|lute wickedne&s;s, and the mo&s;t brutal profligacy of manners;
<PB N="334" REF="011212_0172_0F862F1463AC5EB8">yea, as becoming infidels and barbarians. And it is here called a &s;candalous neglect of the authority of the Briti&s;h nation, which brings great and de&s;erved reproach upon them, to &s;uffer us, in the&s;e plantations to continue &s;uch infidels and barbarians, as to remain in the practice of pre&s;byteriani&s;m, which is here &s;tiled wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>This &s;ermon, Dr. Chandler calls an excellent one, and re|joiceth to find his own &s;entiments &s;o clearly and forcibly expre&s;&s;ed in it. I have therefore his own authority for con&s;idering this repre&s;entation, which the Bi&s;hop gives of this country, as his own; from which, notwith&s;tanding all that moderation and &s;hew of candour with which he makes a parade in the Appeal, it appears that in his view of the ca&s;e, pre&s;byteriani&s;m has no|thing of Chri&s;tianity in it; yea, that it is the mo&s;t di&s;&s;olute wickedne&s;s, by which we make our&s;elves infidels and barbarians. And altho' he would fain per&s;uade us to believe, that he his no de&s;ign to give the lea&s;t di&s;turbance to &s;uch as are of any other denomination, by the introduction of Bi&s;hops; yet how ready is he to accu&s;e the King and parliament of a &s;candalous neglect, and as expo&s;ing them to great and de&s;erved reproach, for not interpo&s;ing their authority for our recovery, from this di&s;&s;olute wickedne&s;s of pre&s;byteriani&s;m. What &s;incerity can there be in his repeated and po&s;itive declarations, that he aims not at any thing beyond the harmle&s;s, enfeebled and di&s;armed creature of a Bi&s;hop, which &s;tands de&s;cribed in his Appeal? Can we believe him that he de&s;ires the authority of the nation, &s;hould continue in &s;uch a practice, which he looks upon as a &s;candalous neglect! Or is it not evidently his aim to introduce epi&s;copacy, as a leading &s;tep to engage the civil &s;word, to con|vert us from the barbarous infidelity of pre&s;byteriani&s;m to the Chri&s;tian faith, which is to be found only in the prelatic church? It is evidently in this view of the ca&s;e, that he pleads for the nece&s;&s;ity of Bi&s;hops in this country, repre&s;enting throughout his Appeal, that there can be no real church, or Chri&s;tianity among us upon any other footing, and that every argument than can be urged in favour of religion, mu&s;t be under&s;tood as being in favour, and as &s;hewing the nece&s;&s;ity of his gho&s;tly pre|late.</P>
<P>It is plain the Bi&s;hop of Landaff could collect his account of this country from no public hi&s;tory that has ever been written, it being diametrically oppo&s;ite to every other account of us, that has been ever publi&s;hed to the world. The only medium of in|telligence from whence he can be &s;uppo&s;ed to collect it, mu&s;t be private corre&s;pondence. And as the Dr. has &s;o freely declared, that he finds his own &s;entiments of us plainly expre&s;&s;ed by the
<PB N="335" REF="011212_0172_0F862F1463AC5EB8">Bi&s;hop, it is but doing him ju&s;tice to e&s;teem him the per&s;on to whom the Bi&s;hop is indebted for his information. And to &s;peak the truth, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, the account he has given of us to the Bi&s;hop of Landaff, is as near the truth, as u&s;ually are the accounts tran&s;mitted by him and his brother mi&s;&s;ionaries, to the &s;ociety which employ them. The Dr. makes frequent com|plaints of per&s;ecution, repre&s;enting his party and his cau&s;e as being heavily loaded with it. And yet, not a man on the con|tinent can &s;hew any thing this gentleman had to pre&s;ent the idea of per&s;ecution to his mind, unle&s;s it be the plea&s;ing forethought of being &s;oon able to make u&s;e of the convincing arguments of confi&s;cation and faggot, for the conver&s;ion of pre&s;byterians. A &s;pirit of bigotry this, not inferior to that which once blazed in that fiery prelate Arch bi&s;hop Laud, who&s;e character will &s;tand mark'd with indelible infamy, as long as the Briti&s;h annals &s;hall endure, for his more than brutal &s;avagene&s;s towards his fellow creatures, cloak'd under the &s;pecious ma&s;k of religion, and con|ducted with a pious zeal for the church. All that the Bi&s;hop of Landaff, or Dr. Chandler him&s;elf want, in order to &s;hine with the &s;ame lu&s;tre, is only to arrive at the &s;ame meridian. Bigotry and &s;uper&s;tition are, in our fallen &s;tate, the natural product of that tendency to religion, implanted in human nature, in its rectitude, which prompts to this inquiry, "Wherewith &s;hall I come be|fore the Lord." And altho' the kind father of the univer&s;e, has been plea&s;ed, by the medium of divine revelation, to give us needful direction; yet, mi&s;taking the true &s;cope of the divine precept, while confident of having divine revelation for our guide; the tendency of our nature to religion, fills us with zeal, and we become furiou&s;ly mad, verily thinking we are doing God &s;ervice; while we are really fighting again&s;t Heaven. A notable in&s;tance of this enthu&s;ia&s;m we have in the Briti&s;h annals, which gave ri&s;e to the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of America, in the reigns of tho&s;e two weak princes, James I. and Charles I. who by de&s;igning men, were ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to become tools to prie&s;tly tyranny. While &s;ome were endeavouring to re&s;tore popi&s;h &s;uper&s;tition, others were aiming at exalting the prelatic church, to as formi|dable an height as the Pope him&s;elf. By the&s;e united &s;chemes, &s;o fierce a fire was kindled in the nation, as rendered that region too hot for &s;uch of its inhabitants as con&s;cientiou&s;ly govern'd their conduct, and wor&s;hipped their maker with a go&s;pel &s;pirit, and obliged them to &s;eek &s;helter among the &s;avages of America, whom they found more ho&s;pitable than the dignified prelates of their native &s;oil. And altho' this per&s;ecuting &s;pirit of bigotry has been &s;o often expo&s;ed, by writers of all denominations; yet how &s;urpri&s;ingly does this <HI>ignis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">atuus</HI> again kindle and rekindle
<PB N="336" REF="011212_0173_0F862F15242F6D80">between the Dr. and the Bi&s;hop of Landaff, together with the other members of the convention! And unle&s;s ju&s;t Heaven &s;hall bla&s;t their malevolent &s;cheme, it will be nece&s;&s;ity for us to look out for the di&s;covery of another new world, in which we may take &s;helter from the approaching &s;torm, as our fore fathers did in this.</P>

<P>THE grand &s;cope of the <HI>American Churchman</HI> (Whig No. 25) was to exculpate the generality of American Churchmen, of all concern in the late prelatical &s;cheme; but the grand &s;cope of the TRUE <HI>Churchman</HI> (as he calls him&s;elf) <HI>Whip</HI> No. 29. &s;eems to be to prove (if po&s;&s;ible) that tho&s;e who dare pre&s;ume to di&s;&s;ent from his MAJESTY's and the <HI>national</HI> religion, are di&s;loyal &s;ubjects.

From the <HI>cup of cold water</HI> mentioned by our Saviour, he wou'd infer (par. 8.) the nece&s;&s;ity of a fat <HI>warm</HI> benefice; from his orders by his Apo&s;tles, that tho&s;e <HI>"who preach the go&s;pel &s;hou'd live by the go&s;pel"</HI> and <HI>be gives to ho&s;pitality</HI>" he wou'd fain argue, that they ought to have <HI>palaces</HI> to receive, and plumb pudding to entertain &s;trangers; and by the provi&s;ion made (under the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> theocracy) for the prie&s;ts, that they might not be oblig'd to meddle with <HI>&s;ecular bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> (par. 9.)

But words and papers out of the que&s;tion, <HI>actions, actions, actions!</HI> Mr. T.

But <HI>blind</HI> indeed mu&s;t be their eyes who from the &s;ociety's words, "upon renewed in|&s;tances from Governor's of provinces, mini&s;ters, ve&s;tries and pri|vate per&s;ons, &amp;c."&mdash;can infer that a majority of American epi&s;|copalians had &s;olicited an epi&s;copate, and "wide indeed mu&s;t be their throats," who can "&s;wallow" the <HI>T.

<P>Di&s;pleas'd with the picture of American churchmen, drawn by the <HI>A.C.</HI> out <HI>T. C.</HI> gives us another as much beyond, as that

Land Waiter in the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e, and Printer of the New-York Gazette or the Weekly Po&s;t-Boy, in his News-Paper of the 29th of Augu&s;t la&s;t, in which I am treated in the mo&s;t

<BIBL><HI>Bo&s;ton, Augu&s;t</HI> 5, 1768.</BIBL></Q>
<P><HI>To Mr. James Parker, Printer of the American Whig.</HI></P>
<P>I OBSERVE that Mr. S-b-r-y, as I &s;uppo&s;e, in his Paper, printed in the New-York Gazette of July 4, very decently for a clergyman, gives Dr. Chauncey the lie, for a&s;&s;erting, as he &s;ays, that all candidates for holy orders, in the church of Eng|land, have the expences of their voyage home paid by the &s;o|ciety, &amp;c." It would not have been impertinent, if this declai|mer again&s;t fal&s;ehood, had mentioned &s;ome pa&s;&s;age in the Doc|tor's an&s;wer, referring to the page, wherein he affirms this for fact&mdash;Till he is plea&s;ed to do this, I &s;hall take the liberty to think that the Dr. has affirmed no &s;uch thing. He has indeed affirmed "that the &s;ociety has publickly given an invitation to all the colony-&s;tudents, who de&s;ire Epi&s;copal ordination to come to England a&s;&s;uring them that their expences in going to, and returning from thence, &s;hall be defrayed by the &s;ociety;" and he has faithfully referred his readers to the very ab&s;tract and page, in which this invitation and promi&s;e are contained. Up|on which I might a&s;k this &s;tickler for impartiality in writing, whether it was fair dealing to keep &s;o important a fact entirely out of &s;ight? Let him, if he can a&s;&s;ign &s;ome better rea&s;on for his pa&s;&s;ing it over in &s;ilence, than his not knowing what to do with it. He probably knows, if he does not, I now tell him, till he is able to prove, that the &s;ociety never publi&s;hed the a|bove cited invitation and promi&s;e, or that they have &s;ince pub|li&s;hed their revocation of them, the world will judge, and are authorized to judge, that they are bound in &s;trict ju&s;tice to de|fray the expence any young &s;tudents, who go to England for Epi&s;copal ordination, are put to on this account, unle&s;s it is
<PB N="340" REF="011212_0175_0F862F17694C8A50">paid in &s;ome other way. This is all the Dr. wanted, or had in view, in order to a full proof of the point in debate, namely, that the want of a Bi&s;hop in America was no great hard&s;hip to candi|dates, on account of the expence that would ari&s;e from their cro&s;&s;ing the atlantic. This might be galling to our corre&s;pon|dent with '<ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Tickle, and the true rea&s;on, at bottom, of his rude and injurious reflections on the Dr.</P>
<P>I am not ignorant, that the &s;ociety, for &s;ome time, have not defrayed the expence of voyages to England for holy orders. And why? becau&s;e there was no need of it; as this expence has been paid, not by the candidates them&s;elves, but by the com|munities, who expect the benefit of their labours, or by private donations from other per&s;ons here, who wi&s;h the growth of the church, or by the joint contributions of both. Very few, if any, candidates, I have rea&s;on to know, have, for many years, gone from this part of the country for ordination, but the ex|pence of their voyages have been provided for in one or other of tho&s;e ways. I have my&s;elf been frequently called upon for help in &s;uch ca&s;es, and have always been free to afford it. And as the expence of candidates has been borne by others, and in order to le&s;&s;en the di&s;bur&s;ements of the &s;ociety, which would otherwi&s;e have been claimable, and mu&s;t in honour and con|&s;cience have been paid by them, the Doctor's argument remains &s;trong, and cannot be invalidated.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not think it improper to let this over-zealous writer know, that I am not only a &s;on of the church of England, a real hearty friend to its growth and pro&s;perity, but one who has the honour of being a member of the incorporated &s;ociety, for the propagation of the go&s;pel in foreign parts. I am al&s;o a friend to decency, good manners, and a becoming treatment, e&s;pecially of re&s;pectable characters; and what is more, I am a friend to truth and hone&s;t impartiality: and as I am fully con|vinced, that the repre&s;entation the &s;ociety have had from this &s;ide the water are, in many in&s;tances, not only unfair, but no|toriou&s;ly fal&s;e; I am obliged to &s;ay, what I really think, that the greate&s;t occa&s;ion we, at pre&s;ent, have for a Bi&s;hop in Ame|rica, is to correct and keep in order &s;uch trouble&s;ome per&s;ons as this a&s;&s;ociate with The American Whig Whipper, appears to be, who with &s;ome others of the like malevolent &s;pirit, have im|pertinently di&s;turbed the quiet of this country for &s;ometime pa&s;t.</P>
<P>B. W.</P>
<P>I was &s;o little con&s;cious of de&s;erving the malevolent Strictures and fal&s;e In&s;inuations contained in this Letter, that had there
<PB N="341" REF="011212_0175_0F862F17694C8A50">been another Clergyman in this, or either of the neighbouring Colonies, who&s;e Name thus gutted, would have an&s;wered to S-b-r-y in the Letter, I &s;hould have had no Su&s;picion that it was intended for me. But as I found my&s;elf &s;o particularly pointed out, I took the fir&s;t Opportunity of calling on Mr. Par|ker, to &s;ee the original Letter. Mr. Parker &s;hewed me a writ|ten Paper, &s;igned only B. W. and dated at Bo&s;ton. I imme|diately took Notice that the Direction at the Head of this writ|ten Paper. "To Mr. James Parker, &amp;c." and I think the Date at Bo&s;ton were in a different Hand and Ink, from the other Writing. Upon my expre&s;&s;ing my Surpri&s;e, that he &s;hould produce this Paper, &s;igned only B. W. as an original Letter "from a Gentleman, of Figure in Bo&s;ton,"&mdash;and de|manding of him who the Author was, Mr. Parker, after &s;ome Shuffling, and He&s;itation, named Benning Wentworth, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> late Governor of the Province of New-Hamp&s;hire, as the Au|thor; and affirmed that the written Paper he then &s;hewed me, was his Hand Writing. Being a&s;ked by me whether he, (Par|ker) had received the written Paper, &s;igned B. W. from the late Governor Wentworth;&mdash;he replied, that he him&s;elf did not receive it; but that it was &s;ent by Dr. Chauncey, of Bo&s;ton, to &s;ome Gentlemen of this City, to be publi&s;h a his Paper; and that if I denied or doubted its being the Hand Writing of the late Governor Wentworth, he was ready to prove it.&mdash; Comparing in my Mind, Mr. Parker's An&s;wers, and the Circum|&s;tance that the Direction at the Top of the wrriten Paper, was in a different Hand and Ink, from the other Writing. I could not help &s;u&s;pecting that there was &s;ome Fraud or Forgery in the Ca&s;e: And finding from Mr. Parker's frequent Shiftings and Shuflings, that he was not a proper Per&s;on to be conver&s;ed with alone on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion;&mdash;after telling him, that he had in no wi&s;e complied with his own Preamble to the Letter he had printed,&mdash;that I doubted its being the late Gover|nor Wentworth's, and that he &s;hould be applied to about it, I left him.</P>
<P>As Mr. Parker had told other Per&s;ons that the Letter &s;igned B. W. was written by the late Governor Wentworth, a Gen|tleman of Character in this City, had, before I came to Town, written to a Friend of his at Port&s;mouth, concerning the Affair; his Friend's An&s;wer inclo&s;ed the following Letter from the late Governor Wentworth to him, viz.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>After I had &s;een this Letter from Mr. Wentworth. I again called on Mr. Parker, in Company with a Gentleman of un|doubted Credit, in order to obtain a &s;econd Sight of the Pa|per in his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, that I might compare the Writing, with the Letter from Mr. Wentworth. Mr. Parker complained that I had not, when I was la&s;t at his Hou&s;e, treated him like a Gentleman; and then he rummaged over a Box of Papers, and and &s;aid he could not find it; but he repeatedly declared that the Letter &s;igned B. W. and publi&s;hed in his News-Paper, was written by Benning Wentworth, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and tran&s;mitted to New York by Dr. Chauncey, of Bo&s;ton, with a Direction to have it printed in his Paper. Upon my de&s;iring him to produce his Proofs, which in a former Conver&s;ation he had &s;aid he could give, that the Letter publi&s;hed by him was written by Mr. Wentworth, he replied,&mdash;that he was obliged immediately to attend a Corp&s;e into the Country, and therefore had not Time, but that if I doubted the Authenticity of the &s;aid Letter, if I would go to Mr. Thomas Smith, Attorney at Law, he had &s;uch Proofs in his Hands as would effectually convince me; for that Mr. Smith had received it from Dr. Chauncey, whom he &s;uppo&s;ed I would e&s;teem a Man of Veracity.</P>
<P>From Mr. Parker I went, in Company with the &s;ame Gentle|man who was with me at Mr. Parker's, to Mr. Thomas Smith. Upon metioning my Bu&s;ine&s;s, and telling him that Mr. Parker had declared that Mr. Wentworth was the Author of the Letter &s;igned B. W. and that it was Mr. Wentworth's Hand Writing; and that Mr. Parker had &s;aid that he received the Letter from him, and had referred me to him for the Proofs that the Letter was Mr. Wentworth's;&mdash;he replied, that he had indeed given the &s;aid Letter to Mr. Parker to be printed, that he received it from Mr. Rogers, who recieved it inclo&s;ed in a Letter from Dr. Chauncey, who received <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t from the Gen|tleman him&s;elf in Bo&s;ton;&mdash;that it was no Mr. Wentworth's own Hand Writing, for that Mr. Wenworth was an old Man and could not write; but that it was written by his Order, and that he &s;igned B. W. to it, and gave it to Dr. Chauncey who inclo&s;ed it to Mr. Rogers, who delivered it to him (Thomas Smith) who put it into the Hands of James Parker, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who
<PB N="343" REF="011212_0176_0F862F1841EA2C60">printed it in his Paper. I ob&s;erved upon th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, that Mr. Went|worth did not live in Bo&s;ton. To which Mr. Smith replied, that he was in Bo on at that Time, and that if it would be any Satisfaction to me, if I would wait till the following Week, an Affidavit would arrive from Bo&s;ton, to prove that the Gen|tleman was the Author of the &s;aid Letter</P>
<P>As I ob&s;erved that Mr. Smith cautiou&s;ly avoided mentioning Mr. Wentworth's Name, but always expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf by the Term&mdash;the Gentleman, I &s;u&s;pected that all was not fair, I therefore pre&s;&s;ed him more clo&s;ely, and then he &s;aid that one Rea&s;on why he thought the Letter to be written by Mr. Went|worth, was, that B W. were the initial Letters of no other Name on the Societies Li&s;t of Members, but of Mr. Went|worth's only.&mdash;As I went out of Mr. Smith's Office. I told him that I had &s;uch Proofs in my Pocket, that Mr. Wentworth was not the Author, as would &s;urpri&s;e him and all concerned.</P>
<P>After we came into the Street, I in&s;i&s;ted, that as Mr. Smith had been &s;o very officious, as to go between Mr. Rogers, and Mr. Parker, in the Affair of printing the Letter &s;igned B. W. in which I thought my&s;elf very cruelly and unju&s;tly treated, he ought in Ju&s;tice to procure me a Sight of Dr. Chauncey's Let|ter to Mr. Rogers. Mr. Smith replied that I might take what Steps I plea&s;ed; that he would give him&s;elf no Trouble about it, unle&s;s he chanced to &s;ee Mr. Rogers; and that he never had told Mr. Parker, or any other Per&s;on, that the Letter &s;igned B. W. was written by Mr. Wentworth.</P>
<P>I forgot to mention, that in my Conver&s;ation with Mr. Parker, when I told him that he had not complied with his Promi&s;e in the Introduction which he had printed to the Letter &s;igned B. W. he an&s;wered, That he did not write that Introduction; that he objected to its being printed, and that therefore he did not think him&s;elf obliged by it,&mdash;or Words to that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>From Mr Smith's, I immediately went to Mr. Roger's Hou&s;e, but he was from Home, on a Journey into New-Jer&s;ey, tho' ex|pected to return that Night, or in the Morning. I called again, two or three Times the next Day, but he had not returned. The next Week I &s;et out on a Journey, to Philadelphia, and when I returned, Mr. Rogers was gone into New-England, &s;o that I had no Opportunity of &s;eeing him till &s;ome Time in Novem|ber. Upon my mentioning my Bu&s;ine&s;s to him, he behaved with great Openne&s;s and Candour; readily gave me a Sight of Dr. Chauncey's Letter to him. He without He&s;itation al&s;o de|clared that he did not know, and never had heard who wrote the Letter &s;igned B. W. That when he was lately in Bo&s;ton,
<PB N="344" REF="011212_0177_0F862F19914F9848">Dr. Chauncey mentioned the Matter, but did not chu&s;e to make known the Author's Name.</P>
<P>In Dr. Chauncey's Letter to Mr. Rogers, according to the be&s;t of any Recollection, (for Mr. Rogers did not think him&s;elf at Liberty to permit any Extracts to be taken from it) he &s;ays, That the Letter &s;igned B. W. was written by an Inhabitant of the Town of Bo&s;ton; an Epi&s;copalian by Principle and Edu|cation, and for &s;everal Years pa&s;t a Member of the Society for the Propagation of the Go&s;pel;&mdash;that it was written volun|tarily, and un&s;olicited by him, and put into his Hands for him to make what u&s;e he plea&s;ed of it; that the Author wrote it with a View of exculpating him (Chauncey) from an Accu&s;ati|on of Fal&s;hood, in a Paper publi&s;hed in Mr. Gaine's Gazette, and Weekly Mercury, July the 4th.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>To my dear countrymen; e&s;pecially my friends and brethren, who are attached to, and united in the epi&s;copal cau&s;e.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH fixed in a private &s;tation of life, I have not been a carele&s;s ob&s;erver of what pa&s;&s;eth in public; nor do I look upon my&s;elf unconcerned in debates affecting privileges of a civil, but more e&s;pecially, of a religious nature. I could not look on the late tumults and commotions, occa&s;ioned through the&s;e colonies, by the unhappy Stamp-Act, without the mo&s;t tender concern, knowing the con&s;equences (ever to be dreaded) of a rupture between the mother country and the&s;e plantations; which is an event never to be de&s;ired by tho&s;e who are true friends to either. A real friend of the nation or its colonies, ought therefore to be &s;en&s;ibly alarmed at every thing which has the remote&s;t tendency to increa&s;e the jealou&s;y, or weaken the connection between them.&mdash;Pardon me then, my brethren, if it &s;hould appear to be without ju&s;t foundation, that the vigo|rous efforts lately made, to obtain an American epi&s;copate, have excited my fears, and prevailed on me, in this manner, to u&s;e my
<PB N="345" REF="011212_0177_0F862F19914F9848">endeavours to awaken the attention of &s;uch as are united in the &s;ame religious intere&s;t with my&s;elf. My apprehen&s;ions on this occa&s;ion, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, are various; not being fully &s;atisfied as to the true cau&s;e of tho&s;e endeavours, nor the end really aimed at. Altho' I mu&s;t profe&s;s the &s;incere&s;t regard for the epi&s;copal church in America, and heartily de&s;ire to &s;ee it ble&s;&s;ed with all its mo&s;t ample go&s;pel-privileges; yet whether the la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e attempts to procure American Bi&s;hops, take their ri&s;e from friends to the church, or &s;ecret enemies to both church and &s;tate, appears to me an uncertainty. Whoever con&s;iders the jealou&s;y of the na|tion re&s;pecting its colonies, as being de&s;irous to throw off their dependence upon the mother country; and the mutual jealou&s;ies between the nation and its colonies, &s;o lately excited by the Stamp-Act, cannot far of being alarmed, le&s;t &s;ome evil-de&s;ign|ing men, taking the advantage of the credulity of &s;ome of our well meaning clergy, have &s;tirred up their well intended, but ill-timed zeal, earne&s;tly to &s;olicit the obtaining Bi&s;hops among our&s;elves. An event, which, &s;hould it happen, would &s;o evidently le&s;&s;en the dependence, and weaken the connection of the&s;e colo|nies with the crown. It is &s;aid, there are more than a million of &s;ubjects, di&s;per&s;ed through the plantations, profe&s;&s;ed members of our excellent church, who are all connected with the nation, not only by civil ties, in common with tho&s;e of other denomi|nations; but in addition thereto are &s;trongly united by the &s;acred ties of religion, being in &s;ubjection to, and dependent upon the Bi&s;hops in the mother country. Of this the able &s;tate&s;men of the nation, cannot but be &s;en&s;ible; and from principles of &s;tate-policy, they mu&s;t oppo&s;e the de&s;ign.&mdash;In what light then, will they view tho&s;e &s;trenuous efforts for an American epi&s;copate, but as a &s;ecret de&s;ign, cloak'd with the &s;pecious pretence of reli|gion, to ripen our circum&s;tances for a revolt? Nor will our warme&s;t prote&s;tations of loyalty to the crown, avail to prevent &s;uch apprehen&s;ions concerning us, while the thing we are aim|ing at, whether it be our intention or not, really has &s;uch a tendency.</P>
<P>The&s;e, my dear countrymen and brethren, were my apprehen|&s;ions till the late "Appeal" to the public, fell into my hands; on the reading of which, I was greatly &s;urpri&s;ed, more e&s;pecially at the character there given of the Bi&s;hop &s;ought after, and in|tended for us. A Bi&s;hop that &s;hould have power only to con|firm,&mdash;to ordain,&mdash;and to govern none but the clergy! One that &s;hould have nothing to do with us who are in lay-commu|nion, &s;ave only to confirm!&mdash;How different this from the character of a &s;cripture Bi&s;hop, as we have always been taught! &mdash;And how far from being able to an&s;wer the great and
<PB N="346" REF="011212_0178_0F862F1AE60B0380">good ends of religion among us!&mdash;are there none but our clergy, that &s;tand in need of the godly di&s;cipline of the church; And mu&s;t we of the laity be as &s;heep going a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ray, without any to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> to the fold? Is not the di&s;cipline of the church, of divine appointment, to be a guard to our virtue, to quicken and &s;trengthen us in maintaining Chri&s;tian watchfulne&s;s over our&s;elves, and for our recovery to repentance after a relap&s;e? I &s;hould be content with a Bi&s;hop &s;tript of tho&s;e temporal dignities, which by the law of the nation, have been &s;uperadded to that office: But one dive&s;ted of &s;uch an e&s;&s;ential part of the autho|rity given him by the go&s;pel, appears to me really wor&s;e than none at all; becau&s;e he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;oon fall into contempt, and the credit of religion, e&s;pecially the credit of the epi&s;copal per&s;ua&s;ion, &s;ink with him.</P>
<P>That the Bi&s;hop intended for us, &s;hould be &s;uch a maimed, incomplete creature, was, to me, really &s;upri&s;ing and unaccount|able, till by a more attentive view of the whole di&s;cour&s;e, I was alarmed with &s;hrewd marks of a covered de&s;ign in the &s;cheme. &mdash;The rea&s;on which is there held up to public view, is to prevent our de&s;ign of having Bi&s;hops from being oppo&s;ed by our neighbours of other religious denominations. But however plau&s;ible and catholick this, at fir&s;t &s;ight, may appear, yet I am per&s;uaded any one who attentively con&s;iders the matter will, with me, be fully convinced, that this is only u&s;ed as a palliative, whild a latent project is carried on, either again&s;t them, or again&s;t us. If the &s;ecret aim is levelled again&s;t our neighbours of other per&s;ua&s;ions, to lull them a&s;leep, and prevent their oppo&s;ing our &s;cheme of getting an American epi&s;copate, e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in &s;uch an inoffen&s;ive and harmle&s;s &s;hape hoping after|wards to have him the more ea&s;ily completely ve&s;ted with a full character; if, I &s;ay, this is the &s;ecret aim, 'tis manife&s;t the pious fraud is not &s;o clo&s;ely concealed as to e&s;cape their notice, as is evident from the "American Whig," who &s;o often appears in this paper, and whom I &s;hall leave to manage his own cau&s;e.</P>
<P>But why, my brethren, &s;hould others take the alarm, and we &s;leep on &s;ecure? Is our cau&s;e invulnerable? Or is it impo&s;&s;ible there &s;hould be any evil imagination, and &s;ecret intrigues car|ried on again&s;t us? It &s;urely cannot but appear &s;urpri&s;ing, that the Bi&s;hop intended for us &s;hould be like the "log in the fable, who was made king of the frogs." Or, as the prophet &s;ays of the idols, "One that can do no good, nor is it in him to do hurt." If this is not meant to delude our neighbours of other religious denominations it mu&s;t be to delude us, and keep us quiet till &s;uch a Bi&s;hop be &s;ent, as would be equally di&s;plea&s;ing to us, as to them. What objections could the Di&s;&s;enters make
<PB N="347" REF="011212_0178_0F862F1AE60B0380">again&s;t a prelate clothed with full eccle&s;ia&s;tical power to govern the laity in communion with the church of England, as well as her clergy, &s;uppo&s;ing his juri&s;diction confined to them, and not extended to others? It is plain, they could have none. Is it not therefore de&s;igned to cajole us into a compliance with &s;ome &s;e|cret de&s;ign artfully concealed from public view? It is well known, that many of tho&s;e additional powers, conferred on Bi&s;hops at home, by the &s;tatutes of the nation, would be as griev|ous to us, as to our di&s;&s;enting neighbours; and to which, (were we appri&s;ed of it) we &s;hould be as ready to make oppo&s;ition, as they. The payment of tithes, the probate of wills, the licen&s;e of marriages; but above all, the &s;piritual courts, that di&s;grace of our church, and intolerable grievance of the nation; are things to which we can, by no means con&s;ent; and again&s;t the introduction of which, we &s;hould be equally oppo&s;ed, were we but &s;en&s;ible any &s;uch things were intended. If our &s;ecret &s;chemers can but lull us to &s;leep, and amu&s;e us with the expec|tation of having Bi&s;hops among&s;t our&s;elves, from whom we may hope for &s;ignal &s;piritual advantages and thereby prevail with us, to u&s;e our influence for facilitating their de&s;igns, in procuring to be &s;et over us &s;uch, as in&s;tead of being agreeable to our wi&s;hes, will prove the very rever&s;e of what we expected; and in&s;tead of being a ble&s;&s;ing, will really prove a cur&s;e: How grievous will be our di&s;appointment? And &s;hall we not ever blame our&s;elves for that &s;upine negligence, whereby we now &s;uffer our&s;elves to be wheedled into their pernicious devices?</P>
<P>Are we to have a Bi&s;hop; let him be a Bi&s;hop. Let him be &s;et over us with the full authority which the go&s;pel gives him. Let him exerci&s;e that ancient godly di&s;cipline of the primitive church, the want of which, we are taught in our &s;ervice, yearly to lament:&mdash;But let him not come to plague and harra&s;s us, with that &s;hameful &s;ub&s;titute of a &s;piritual court. I am &s;en&s;i|ble, that alterations cannot be made i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the religious con&s;titution of the church at home, without the hazard of great convul&s;i|ons in the &s;tate; and how far this may ju&s;tify our nation in re|taining the &s;piritual courts, which are &s;o loudly and ju&s;tly com|plained of; and not re&s;toring the godly di&s;cipline of the ancient church; I &s;hall not take upon me to determine. But what is there to hinder the e&s;tabli&s;hment of Bi&s;hops in this part of the world, after the truly primitive pattern; or what is there to keep out the godly di&s;cipline of the primitive church among&s;t us;&mdash;where no modern corrupt &s;ub&s;titutes are introduced to prevent it? If we have Bi&s;hops at all, it is evident there is no|thing to prevent their coming clothed with their true primitive authority in the church.

And if, to quiet us, we &s;hould be told, that when once we have ob|tained the e&s;tabli&s;hment of Bi&s;hops in this inoffen&s;ive character propo&s;ed, it will be an ea&s;y matter to obtain any additions to his office, as occa&s;ion &s;hall require:&mdash;I mu&s;t &s;till demand what &s;ecurity can be given us, that the additions &s;hall not be the &s;ame, wherewith the Bi&s;hops at home are now inve&s;ted; which would be as grievous to us, as to any of the non-conformi&s;ts.&mdash; If they come at all, it is plain, they may come as inoffen&s;ively both to us, and to them, clothed with the power of the primi|tive di&s;cipline, as without it; which of all things, would be the mo&s;t effectual &s;ecurity again&s;t &s;piritual courts, and other griev|ous and ju&s;tly dreaded con&s;equences. The maimed and muti|lated creature pleaded for in the Appeal to the Public, is there|fore to me, and mu&s;t be to every intelligent friend of our church, &s;ufficient to alarm us, and put us upon our guard, le&s;t kind words and fair &s;peeches allure us to expect good, when evil is really intended.</P>

'Tis really plea&s;ant to &s;ee <HI>&s;uch</HI> an argument advanc'd, when the "&s;pirit of the times" evidently is, to create new Bi&s;hops, with their &s;ubaltern officers, and make <HI>Lords of trade</HI> of the old ones.

<P>On the whole, the conduct of Dr. <HI>C.</HI> Sq. <HI>T.</HI> and Co. &amp;c. is extremely odd. If <HI>we</HI> are not "convinc'd" by <HI>their</HI> pleas for the nece&s;&s;ity and <HI>apo&s;tolicality</HI> of epi&s;copacy, they tell us, it is &s;ufficient that <HI>they</HI> are; but, when we tell them why we are afraid of tho&s;e <HI>apo&s;tolical</HI> gentlemen, call'd BISHOPS, they even huff us, and try to cram conviction down our throats, by autho|ritatively a&s;&s;erting, that our apprehen&s;ions are "totally devoid of any foundation." Or, if they conde&s;end to produce argu|ments, they are, as the reader &s;ees as flim&s;y as cobwebs. If they wou'd but act rea&s;onably (&s;ince neither party can be convinc'd) they wou'd candidly leave the affair to be determin'd by a majority, as Dr. <HI>C. &s;eem'd</HI> to do; but alas! they unex|pectedly find this method wou'd ruin all their favourite &s;chemes.</P>
<P>Some time ago I happen'd to be in an inn, where &s;ix gentle|men agreed to have a di&s;h of &s;oup at dinner. One of them, be|ing a <HI>Frenchman</HI> in&s;i&s;ted on having <HI>&s;hallots</HI> in it, tho' they were di&s;agreeable to all the re&s;t of company. When <HI>they</HI> objected, he &s;wore, the <HI>&s;hallots</HI> wou'd &s;ea&s;on only <HI>his</HI> &s;ide of the di&s;h, and undertook to prove it, but, they not being "convinc'd" either by his word or his arguments, he rudely told <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hem, they were <HI>ene|mies to liberty,</HI> and he wou'd overturn the table, if they did not con&s;ent to indulge him. <HI>Reader,</HI> make the application.</P>

<HEAD>From Mr. GAINE'S GAZETTE, Dec. 26, 1768. A WHIP for the AMERICAN WHIG. By TIMOTHY TICKLE, ESQR. [No. XXXVIII.]</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>A Continuation of Mr.</HI> SEABURY<HI>'s Letter, (Whip No.</HI> 37.)</HEAD>
<P>HAVING thus given a ju&s;t and faithful hi&s;torical Account of this Affair, I &s;hall now make &s;ome Reflections upon the Letter it&s;elf. And,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t, I &s;hall take Notice of the Spirit and Temper with which it is written. It appears, both from the Letter it&s;elf, and from Dr. Chauncey's Letter to Mr. Rogers, that the De&s;ign of the Letter Writer was to vindicate him (Dr. Chauncey) from an Accu&s;ation of Fal&s;hood; But with what Spirit has the Author done this, or more properly attempted it?&mdash;With the mo&s;t ma|levolent Party Rage, and with &s;uch Rancour and Ill-Nature, as none but a Heart inflamed by Malice could dictate. The whole Letter &s;hews this to have been the Temper and State of Mind in which it was written, and no Cen&s;ure pa&s;&s;ed upon it can po&s;&s;i|bly expo&s;e it. In&s;tead of vindicating Dr. Chauncey, he rails at Mr. S-b-ry; accu&s;es him of "giving Dr. Chauncey the Lie," &mdash;of making "rude and injurious Reflections on the Dr."&mdash;of being a "trouble&s;ome Per&s;on,"&mdash;of a "malevolent Spirit,"&mdash; of having "impertinently di&s;turbed the Quiet of this Country for &s;ome Time pa&s;t," and &s;trange to tell! of being a "Declaimer again&s;t Fal&s;hood," and a "Stickler for Impartiality in writing." &mdash;If by this Country the Letter Writer means Bo&s;ton, and the Territority thereunto belonging, I &s;eriou&s;ly declare, That I have been &s;o far from "di&s;turbing the Quiet of that Country," that I never was in it; that I have no Agents in it; that I do not recollect ever to have wrote a &s;ingle Letter to any Per&s;on in it: &mdash;In &s;hort, I have, and de&s;ire to have nothing to do with it.</P>
<P>If by this Country the Letter-Writer means the American Colonies in general;&mdash;I do not remember that I have done any Thing by which the Quiet of any one Per&s;on could have been di&s;turbed, except, that I once called the American Whig to an Account, for his Effrontery in &s;aying, that Dr. Chandler "and the Convention, do not de&s;ire &s;uch a Bi&s;hop as is mentioned in the Appeal:" And if the American Whig will allow me a very &s;mall Share of that Vanity with which he him&s;elf is &s;o replete, I can confidently affirm, that in the Affair litigated between us at that Time, I "laid him fairly on his Back without knowing my Anta|goni&s;t;"&mdash;whether
<PB N="352" REF="011212_0181_0F862F23850A19A0">he hath &s;ince gotten upon his Legs, or whe|ther, <HI>ad hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">umbit Humi</HI> Bos, is a Matter of more Con&s;e|quence to him than to me.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. The Letter &s;igned B. W. as far as it relates to me, is "utterly, ab&s;olutely and entirely fal&s;e and groundle&s;s." And tho' this Writer is &s;o very angry with Mr. S-b-r-y, for giving, as he &s;ays, "Dr. Chauncey the Lie," yet he him&s;elf has writ|ten without any Regard to Truth. I &s;peak only of what relates to my&s;elf in B. W's Letter,&mdash;a lying Heart hath directed a de|ceitful Hand.&mdash;I po&s;itively declare, that I was &s;o far from being the Author of the Paper to which he refers, that I never &s;aw it, heard it, thought of it, or dreamed of it, 'til it made its pub|lic Appearance in Mr Gaine's Paper of July 4th &mdash; Who B. W. is, I know not, and to &s;peak the Truth, care not But B. W. &s;ays, he is "a Son of the Church of England,"&mdash;"a real Friend to its Growth and Pro&s;perity,"&mdash;"a Member of the Society for the Propagation of the Go&s;pel in foreign Parts,"&mdash;a Friend to Decency, good Manners, and a becoming Treatment, e&s;pecially, of re&s;pectable Characters,"&mdash;"and what is more&mdash;a Friend to Truth and hone&s;t Impartiality."&mdash;If Mr. B. W. is endowed with all the&s;e good Qualifications, it is very &s;trange that not one of them &s;hould &s;hew it&s;elf in the Letter now under my Con&s;idera|tion.&mdash;Is he a "Son of the Church of England?" Let him re|member that the Church teaches and requires him "to keep his Tongue from evil Speaking, Lying, and Slandering." Is he "a Friend to the Growth and Pro&s;perity of the Church?" &mdash;Why then does he take Part with its avowed Enemy? Why does he repre&s;ent tho&s;e who contend only for its real and ju&s;t Rights and Privileges, as trouble&s;ome Per&s;ons, of a malevolent Spirit, who have impertinently di&s;turbed the Quiet of their Country for &s;ome Time pa&s;t? Is he a "Member of the Society for the Propagation of the Go&s;pel?" That venerable Body have ever cheri&s;hed, countenanced, and protected tho&s;e Mi&s;&s;iona|ries that did their Duty; they never abu&s;ed, &s;lander'd, or vili|fied them, in anonymous Letters and &s;currilous Papers.&mdash;Is he "a Friend to Decency and good Manners, and a becoming Treatment, e&s;pecially of re&s;pectable Characters?" Why then has he treated me with &s;o much Indecency and Ill-Manners? If a &s;teady and &s;incere De&s;ire and Endeavour to do my Duty in that honourable State of Life to which it hath plea&s;ed God to call me, will entitle me to any Re&s;pect. I may, without Vanity affirm, that my Character is re&s;pectable enough to have entitled me to a more becoming Treatment. Is he "a Friend to Truth and hone&s;t Impartiality?" How could &s;uch a Per&s;on, write
<PB N="353" REF="011212_0181_0F862F23850A19A0">&s;uch a Letter?&mdash;A Letter from which, if you take all that is fal&s;e and partial, you will leave a mere Chart Blanch.</P>
<P>Mr. B. W. &s;ays I "gave Dr. Chauncey the Lie." It is a Form of Speech in which I do not allow my&s;elf to my menial Servants: And with Regard to any Thing Dr. Chauncey hath &s;aid in his An&s;wer to Dr. Chandler's Appeal, I am &s;o far from giving him the Lie, that I deliberately declare I never read more than a Dozen Pages in it, and never intend to read a Dozen more.&mdash;When an Author can calmly and &s;eriou&s;ly &s;et him&s;elf to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch wild Po&s;itions as that "the Church of England does not teach the Divine Right of Epi&s;copacy, and that her Reformers did not believe it," I can &s;pend my Time much more profitably than in giving him the Reading. Perhaps it may be alledged in Excu&s;e for the Dr. that he wrote his Pamphlet in le&s;s than two Months; that he is an old Man, and thefore it mu&s;t be expected he will be tedious and po&s;itive: Tediou&s;ne&s;s and Po&s;itive|ne&s;s being often the Foibles of old Age. This I confe&s;s would be a good Excu&s;e for not writing at all; and it is much to be la|mented, that the Dr. does not avail him&s;elf of it, and of the Poet's Advice,

<P>That the Dr. is in &s;ome Danger of meeting with this Accident, every one mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, who con&s;iders with what Rapidity he an&s;wered Dr. Chandler, if any Credit is due to the American Whig. And now behold he hath adverti&s;ed a Volume of Thirty Sheets at lea&s;t, in which the Fathers of the Church are, many Centuries after their Martyrdom, again to be put to the Rack, and tortured into Confe&s;&s;ions. If however the Dr. &s;hould e&s;cape this Fate, the following Line of another Poet, will be very ap|plicable to &s;o voluminous a Writer.&mdash;"See who ne'er was nor will be half-read."&mdash;This, as I put no Motto to this Paper, many &s;erve in&s;tead of one to tho&s;e who are found of Motto's; and I hope it will not be thought the wor&s;e for being introduced in the Body of my Performance.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. I &s;hall take Notice of the villainous Ba&s;ene&s;s of this Wri|ter, in putting B. W. at the End of his Letter. Po&s;&s;ibly he thought he had a Right to pre&s;s any two Letters in the Alpha|bet into his Service. But certainly it is a mo&s;t extraordinary Piece of Conduct, fir&s;t to declare him&s;elf a Member of the So|ciety, and then to affix the initial Letters of another Member's
<PB N="354" REF="011212_0182_0F862F2425808278">Name to his &s;candalous Production; e&s;pecially when it is con|&s;idered, that B. W. are the initial Letters of no other Name on the Society's Li&s;t of Members, but only of Benning Wentworth, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and that this B. W's Letter, tho' now it has all the Ap|pearance of a ba&s;e-born Child, brought forth in Secrecy, was u&s;hered into the World, by James Parker, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who acted the Part of Man-Midwife at its Birth, as the legitimate Offspring of a reputable Parent, who was ready to own, &s;upport, and de|fend it. Whether the Writer intended by this artful Conduct, to lead People into a Belief that the Letter was really written by a Gentleman of &s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed a Reputation as Mr. Went|worth is, in order to give a greater Weight to his A&s;&s;ertions; or whether it was with a De&s;ign to terrify Mr. S-b-r-y from re|plying to his infamous Performance, is not ea&s;y to determine: Po&s;&s;ibly both the&s;e Motives may have concurred, to induce him to proceed in this da&s;tardly, fradulent Manner. The fir&s;t of the&s;e Inventions was fully an&s;wered in this Place, by the &s;igning B. W. to the Letter, and by "Mr. Parker's po&s;itive A&s;&s;ertion, That Mr. Wentworth was the Author of it." That the other De&s;ign did not &s;ucceed, the Author is by this Time, I believe, pretty well convinced.</P>
<P>The Author has declared him&s;elf a Member of the Society for the Propagation of the Go&s;pel; and Dr. Chauncey &s;ays (if I remember right) in his Letter to Mr. Rogers, "that he is an Inhabitant of the Town of Bo&s;ton." I have carefully examined the Li&s;t of the Society's Members for the Year 1767, I can find only four Members who re&s;ide in Bo&s;ton, viz. His Excellency Francis Bernard, James Apthorp, Hugh Hall, and John Tem|ple, E&s;qrs. To all the&s;e Gentlemen I am per&s;onally unknown. I am utterly at a Lo&s;s to conceive, that I have ever given any Occa&s;ion to them to treat me in &s;o injurious and cruel a Man|ner, as I find m&s;elf treated in that Letter. I cannot therefore &s;uppo&s;e, that any one of the&s;e Gentlemen was the Au|thor of it. It remains then with Dr. Chauncey to produce his Author, or to take the Letter, with all its "Fraud, Forgery, Villainy, Scandal, Fal&s;hood, and Ba&s;ene&s;s," upon him&s;elf.</P>
<P>To you therefore, mo&s;t venerable Doctor, I now beg Leave to addre&s;s my&s;elf. Po&s;&s;ibly you may think I treat you with too great Freedom; that your Age, Station, and Character &s;hould exempt you from it. Age is not an Excu&s;e for &s;uch ba&s;e Conduct as you have been guilty of, and therefore it ought not to &s;creen you from the Con&s;equences of it. My Station and Character, (&s;ave the Article of Learning) are equal to yours; and if you think that &s;ome Regard is due to the Station and Character, you ought to have con&s;idered, before your illiberal Attack upon me.&mdash;You

<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>The advantages of a new interpretation of Scripture in</HI> favour of an American epi&s;copate, <HI>in</HI> ASERMON, <HI>Occa&s;ioned by a late celebrated compari&s;on of the church to the woman in the apocalyp&s;e,</HI> BY <HI>The Right reverendly&mdash;inclined Charles Doubledee.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dearly beloved brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>GREAT are the advantages of a new interpretation of &s;crip|ture. By this we are relieved from many burdens and yokes of bondage, to which former interpreters have unrea&s;ona|bly &s;ubjected us. 1&s;t. We &s;hall be delivered from the irk&s;ome duty of believing in the &s;un of righteou&s;ne&s;s for ju&s;tification, which has always been in&s;i&s;ted upon by the old interpreters of of this text; who, by the &s;un here, fooli&s;hly under&s;tood Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his merits, by faith in whom true Chri&s;tians were to be ju&s;tified. This they &s;poke of as the great glory dignity and honour of believers:&mdash;And therefore have urged mankind with truly non&s;en&s;ical zeal to believe in Chri&s;t, and to look to him for becoming to them in a &s;piritual &s;en&s;e, what the &s;un in the firmament was in a natural &s;en&s;e.&mdash;2dly, We &s;hall be delivered from the in&s;upportable burden of regulating our reli|gious &s;entiments, according to the doctrine taught in the New-Te&s;tament by the twelve Apo&s;tles. By the crown of twelve &s;tars in our text, has generally been under&s;tood, by dreaming commentators, conformity in articles of faith to the doctrine of the Apo&s;tles.&mdash;And hence much learned pains have been taken in comparing &s;cripture with &s;cripture, to fix and determine the leading principles of Chri&s;tianity: But now, this drudgery of believing orthodoxly, which has done much mi&s;chief in the world, we are happily freed from, by a modern paraphra&s;t, who demon&s;trates, that all the antient commentators have been mi&s;|taken
<PB N="357" REF="011212_0183_0F862F24EA46BD18">in under&s;tanding by the twelve &s;tars, the apo&s;tolic doctrines of Chri&s;tianity.&mdash;3dly, Another great advantage, accruing to Chri&s;tians, by the new mode of interpretation is, that they will be happily re&s;cued from the mortifying bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;elf-de|nial. There will be no need of &s;piritual mindedne&s;s, cro&s;&s;ing our carnal inclinations, or &s;triving again&s;t terrene affections. You know, my brethren, that this has been the interpretation, generally gone into by our old divines, of "the moon under her feet." But now it appears, they were only a pack of "hot|headed writers, and pragmatical enthu&s;ia&s;ts, who expected to find their account in rai&s;ing a combu&s;tion and being noi&s;y." Thus you &s;ee that renouncing the old interpretation of &s;cripture, will introduce you into a glorious liberty. The antient inter|preters and teachers were always for &s;hackling us with the doc|trine of ju&s;tification by faith in the merits of Chri&s;t, with the nece&s;&s;ity of a good degree of apo&s;tolic orthodoxy in our &s;enti|ments, and what was wor&s;t of all, with the indi&s;pen&s;ible obli|gation of an holy walk and conver&s;ation; but the new inter|pretation &s;ets us free from all this more than Egyptian bondage. &mdash;Now to &s;hew further wherein the antients were mi&s;taken, and to &s;ot the advantages of the new interpretation in a true light: This woman, clothed with the &s;un, having a crown of twelve &s;tar on her head, and the moon under her feet, is The Church dre&s;&s;ed and dignified with the glorious trappings, ap|pendages, perqui&s;ites and advantages, which ari&s;e from her ble&s;|&s;ed "alliance with the &s;tate in Chri&s;tian countries." The&s;e ornaments are in our text mentioned under three heads, "which may be reduced to civil power, temporal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and legal exemptions."&mdash;Civil power is the clothing of the &s;un. You know what a brilliant &s;igure the church always makes, when &s;he has regal dignity at her head, is incircled with gartered peers, and led into green pa&s;tures by mitred lords.&mdash;Temporal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions is her crown of twelve &s;tars. The&s;e are the tenth part of the lands of the &s;tate, which were &s;olemnly offered in holy unburnt &s;acrifice by "St. Ethelwulph, for the health of his &s;oul on the altar of Winche&s;ter" temple, An. 854; to which is added a tenth part of all the labour and indu&s;try of the King's &s;ubjects, who are to manure and cultivate the&s;e lands for the church, together with a multitude of other perqui&s;ites ari&s;ing from matters te&s;tamentary and matrimonial. This is a glorious crown, well &s;et with gems, which cau&s;es the church to &s;hine with orient lu&s;tre!&mdash;Legal exemption, is another important part of her dre&s;s. The church enjoys the &s;un of civil power, and the glorious crown of temporal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, without the griev|ous incumbrance of duties and taxes for the &s;upport of govern|ment,
<PB N="358" REF="011212_0184_0F862F25ACCA9938">the poor, or any other charges of &s;tate. Thus &s;he has the moon under her feet; has not the mortification of parting with her lands or money either to protect or defend her.</P>
<P>Again, the new method of interpretation di&s;clo&s;es more truth from the text. By the &s;un is farther meant the exten&s;ive bi&s;hop|rics and metropolitan &s;ees of the church. The&s;e give light to Chri&s;tian eyes, and are a lamp to their feet&mdash;By the crown of twelve &s;tars is intended the hierarchy of the church. 1. Arch|bi&s;hops, 2. Dioce&s;ans, 3. Prebends, 4. Deans, 5. Suffragans, 6. Chancellors, 7. Vice-Chancellors, 8. Archdeacons, 9. Rec|tors, 10. Prebends, 11. Curates, 12. Prelatical Baillies. The&s;e are the twelve &s;tars that be&s;pangle her crown of temporal po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions; and an illu&s;trious con&s;tellation they are&mdash;None can object here, "unle&s;s they do it from ignorance or malice," that the&s;e church-officers are not found in the Bible; for they are clearly found in our text, and any doctrine or office, proved by one text, is every way &s;ufficiently e&s;tabli&s;hed. But we have not only this one text, to &s;upport our prelatic church, but we can ea&s;ily pre&s;s more into our &s;urvice. And where the&s;e fail us, we can ea&s;ily admini&s;ter conviction of our point by the unque&s;tiona|ble authority of St. Ignatius, and other more modern fathers, and invincibly prove that the&s;e were the church's crown for al|mo&s;t 1500 years.</P>
<P>Moreover in our context, in the &s;ame vi&s;ions, there appeared "another wonder a great red dragon, having &s;even heads and ten horns." And this dragon is that horrible mon&s;ter, the Engli&s;h di&s;&s;enters, "who have no natural right to any degree of civil or military power. They per&s;ecuted the woman, and &s;he fled into the wilderne&s;s of North-America. And here &s;he now is in a naked, peri&s;hing, and, "without &s;peedy remedies," in an infallibly dying condition. She has neither &s;un, nor moon, nor &s;tars; neither "civil power, temporal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, nor legal ex|emption;" has nothing to guard her, but a parcel of turn-coat Mi&s;&s;ionaries and lazy luxurious prie&s;ts (<HI>paucis exceptis</HI>)&mdash;And now you &s;ee this "renders her outward circum&s;tances and figure widely different;" yea, the difference is as great as between "being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a fortune, and without one,&mdash;or between having a large pari&s;h and a &s;mall one." But you mu&s;t know that the&s;e things do not make any e&s;&s;ential difference in the church. For tho' "the&s;e have generally varied in different countries and ages,&mdash;yet they have not altered its real nature, which is always and e&s;&s;entially the &s;ame under all outward cir|cum&s;tances."&mdash;Whether &s;he is in Rome or Geneva, Georgia or Holland, England or Scotland, Aby&s;&s;inia or America, &s;he is "always and e&s;&s;entially the &s;ame." And as to her "act, whe|ther
<PB N="359" REF="011212_0184_0F862F25ACCA9938">it is performed by the Bi&s;hop of Man, or the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, or in the language to St. Jerom (with whom! per|fectly agree) whether by the Bi&s;hop of "Rome or Rhegium, it mat|ters not."&mdash;If any &s;hould here remark, that then the church "is e&s;&s;entially and always the &s;ame," whether it be popi&s;h or epi&s;copalian, pre&s;byterian or congregational, this can only be "the abu&s;e of &s;ome petulant tongues, or more petulant pens." &mdash;But the woman is now in America, having fled hither, thro' the aid of Dedalian wings, from the face of the &s;erpent; yet the &s;erpent has per&s;ued her to this wilderne&s;s al&s;o, and be&s;ides drawing with his tail many &s;tars of Heaven, he covers more than &s;even-eighths of this wilderne&s;s with his body; yea, he over&s;preads all the northern colonies, except a very few &s;pots, which would in like manner have been covered by the filthy mon&s;ter, had it not been for the unexampled liberality, and truly exce&s;&s;ive "charity of the worthy &s;ociecy." To which &s;ociety "the church owes its exi&s;tence at this day in &s;ome of the colo|nies," for it either had been drowned by the flood, or cru&s;hed beneath the &s;erpent's weight, if the &s;ociety's "indifatigable ap|plication and amazing per&s;everance" had not prevented; becau&s;e the earth here doth not help the woman.&mdash;Thus you &s;ee the great di&s;tre&s;s and peri&s;hing condition of the church; wherefore, travailing in birth and paining to be delivered, her clergy and friends, "looking up to your grace," and call (with our mouths, for we have no trumpets) over the Atlantic to your Maje&s;ty for help and relief in our deplorable and wretched circum&s;tances. Some of us have been looking up and calling over, not merely from morning to evening, but the&s;e 40, 50, or 60 years, and are not heard even to this day. Is the head of the church a&s;leep? Is he deaf or on a journey? or if we leap on our altars, and cut our&s;elves with knives and lancets, will there be no voice nor any to an&s;wer?&mdash;What can be further &s;aid? Is it not demon|&s;trable, that the American church mu&s;t &s;oon peri&s;h? She has neither &s;un to clothe, her, nor moon to tread upon, nor twinkling &s;tars to &s;hed a ray thro' her tremendous gloom. She is peri&s;hing! &s;he is peri&s;hing! her di&s;ea&s;es mu&s;t prove fatal; and none can wonder &s;hould death be the event; for &s;he wants the common nece&s;&s;aries of life. She therefore "earne&s;tly reque&s;ts, and only reque&s;ts" (at pre&s;ent) one &s;tar to comfort her, even a mutilated &s;uffragan, which is far from being a &s;tar of the fir&s;t magnitude. Oh! that proper remedies may be provided for her pre&s;ent &s;uf|ferings! Oh, that &s;he may be delivered out of her unparrallel|led di&s;tre&s;s! Oh! oh! oh!</P>
<P>Now, my very dearly beloved brethren, I di&s;mi&s;s you for the pre&s;ent; whether I have &s;aid any thing "pre&s;umptuous or un|rea&s;onable,
<PB N="360" REF="011212_0185_0F862F26623B6D80">let heaven and earth judge." For all, whether pro|te&s;tants or papi&s;ts, pre&s;byterians, or epi&s;tcopalians, <Q>if they are in reality the friends of truth and ju&s;tice and liberty&mdash;they mu&s;t be heartily di&s;po&s;ed to act a friendly part towards us, with regard to an American epi&s;copate.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Ble&s;&s;ed forever be the Bi&s;hop of Landaff, and let every one of us &s;ay, Amen, Amen.</Q></P>
<P><HI>The Doctor's miracle accounted for, in a natural and ea&s;y man|ner by father Paul, a Romi&s;h writer.</HI></P>
<P>LET us hear what a more celebrated writer than even Chil|lingworth him&s;elf, &s;ays on this &s;ubject.&mdash;A writer as much conver&s;ant with the antiquities of the church as any man living, and who&s;e affinity to the church of Rome, might have blinded him had it been po&s;&s;ible. I mean father Paul of Venice, the admired hi&s;torian of the council of Trent. In his di&s;cour&s;e upon exemptions from epi&s;copal authority Lib. 2. he takes occa|&s;ion to &s;hew how that authority took its ri&s;e, and by what de|grees it ro&s;e to its height. Out of this, compared with that upon epi&s;copal juri&s;diction, Lib. 4. we collect the following in &s;ub&s;tance, tho' not verbatim, viz.</P>
<P>That,</P>
<P><Q>According to St. Paul to the Cor. the whole body of the primitive church, took cognizance of offences, as appears from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is reproving them, that they 'had not lamented to &s;eparate from among them the tran&s;gre&s;&s;or:'&mdash;As their cu&s;tom was to do it with much mourning and fa&s;ting. It was nece&s;&s;ary that the judgment of the multitude &s;hould be d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cted by one, and the Bi&s;hop [or mini&s;ter, according to his office] always pre&s;ided and directed the action. But when Chri&s;tians became numerous, the matter was u&s;ually ripened in the con&s;i&s;tory, and by them propo&s;ed to the general congregation for their re|&s;olution. This form was &s;till on foot in the year 250, as is plainly &s;een by the epi&s;tles of St. Cyprian, concerning tho&s;e who did eat meats offered to idols.&mdash;And St. Jerome te&s;tifies, that in the beginning of Chri&s;tianity the churches were guided by an ari&s;tocracy or common council of the pre&s;bytery.&mdash; The goodne&s;s and charity of the Bi&s;hops, made their opinions for the mo&s;t part to be followed, and by little and little cha|rity waxing cold, this was the cau&s;e why the church not regard|ing the charge laid upon them by Chri&s;t, did leave the care to the Bi&s;hop; 'and ambition a witty pa&s;&s;ion, which doth in|&s;inuate it&s;elf in the &s;hew of virtue," did cau&s;e it to be readily embraced.&mdash;Divi&s;ions at length ari&s;ing among them&s;elves,
<PB N="361" REF="011212_0185_0F862F26623B6D80">they &s;ell upon the monarchial form of government, giving all the &s;uperintendency to the Bi&s;hop, and ridding them&s;elves of the trouble, until the times of per&s;ecution cea&s;ing, the Bi&s;hops (or Mini&s;ters) of one province did govern them&s;elves in &s;ynods, and to make this government more ea&s;y, attributing much to the Bi&s;hop of the principal city, they made him head of that body; and by a more ample communication of all the pro|vinces in a great government, the Bi&s;hop of the head city where the chief ruler did re&s;ide, got a &s;uperiority, as was na|tural, from cu&s;tom. Thus aro&s;e the Romi&s;h Bi&s;hop above all, as Rome was then the capital of the whole world:&mdash;Hence al&s;o the va&s;t influence and power of the patriarchs of Alexan|dria, over Egypt, Lybia and Pentapolis, of Antioch over Sy|ria, and the ea&s;tern provinces, and &s;o of the le&s;&s;er Eparchai or Prefectures. This government brought in by cu&s;tom, and &s;uppo&s;ed conveniency only&mdash;and for &s;ome time executed with great fidelity, was found by Con&s;tantine of great benefit to him in civil affairs, as by it he &s;aw many cau&s;es determined with all the authority and &s;anction of religion. He therefore made a law that there &s;hould lie no appeal from the &s;entences of Bi&s;hops, and that the &s;ecular judge &s;hould execute them, This eccle&s;ia&s;tical form of government with all its peculiari|ties was under him e&s;tabli&s;hed by the fir&s;t council of Nice, and ordained by a canon to be perpetual. After this the autho|rity of Bi&s;hops was from time to time enlarged or dimini&s;hed as affairs happened to turn.</Q></P>
<P>Hence the whole train of dioce&s;an Bi&s;hops, Archbi&s;hops, Me|tropolitans, Primates, Patriarchs and Popes.&mdash;The Doctor's miracle is thus unravelled in a plain and natural manner, and if antiquity has any certain voice, it confirms it.</P>

<P>By his rea&s;oning (to make him a &s;mall compliment) I'm al|mo&s;t convinc'd, that (as I've heard &s;ome &s;ophi&s;tical di&s;putants &s;ay) nothing is &s;o ab&s;urd, but that &s;omething may be &s;aid in it's favour; and yet it's plain, that all he has &s;aid under art. 1.2 and 5, relative to the <HI>King's &s;upremacy,</HI> in&s;tead of proving that the Church of <HI>England</HI> "&s;upports," on the whole rather proves, what is really true, that &s;he is SUBDUED to, the &s;tate. Mighty meritorious this! Henry VIII. the fir&s;t who claim'd eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal &s;upremacy, u&s;urp'd it, not from a "de&s;ire of uniting the Church to the &s;tate," but out of revenge again&s;t the POPE: And if his parliament, in confirming it to him, aim'd at any thing more than gratifying an ambitious monarch they dur&s;t not offend, they doubtle&s;s meant to take care, that "the civil magi&s;trate" &s;hou'd no longer be (as Sq. <HI>T.</HI> expre&s;&s;es it) "a mere tool to the church." As to the Church, &s;he did not <HI>"deprive her&s;elf of her natural independency,"</HI> but &s;urrender'd it &s;orely again&s;t her will, becau&s;e <HI>Harry</HI> was &s;o boi&s;terous, that &s;he dur&s;t not defend it again&s;t him. Sq. <HI>T.</HI> tells us, "religion is the <HI>main</HI> &s;upport of government." This I am not clear in,&mdash;the temporal happine&s;s of mankind being the proper object of go|vernment, it &s;eems to be <HI>mainly</HI> &s;upported by hopes and &s;ears of a temporal kind. I know indeed that religion is of great advan|tage to a &s;tate; but not as a <HI>national religion,</HI> &s;uch a one being, properly &s;peaking, no religion at all, but a mere <HI>political engine.</HI>
<PB N="363" REF="011212_0186_0F862F27435BA268">If &s;uch a religion therefore "&s;upports" a &s;tate, all that can be &s;aid is that <HI>the &s;tate &s;upports it&s;elf.</HI> 'Tis the <HI>divine</HI> or <HI>&s;uppos'd divine</HI> original of a religion, that gives additional &s;upport to a &s;tate, and, were it not for this, the religion of the <HI>Koran</HI> would have no more moral influence on the civil conduct of a mu&s;&s;el-man than on that of the A. Bp. of <HI>C-nt-y.</HI> Hence, uninfluenc'd by any hopes of political advantages, the prote&s;tant (i. e. the <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> or <HI>di&s;&s;enters</HI>) of FRANCE, behav'd &s;o, that <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV, tho' he afterwards revok'd the edict of <HI>Nanter,</HI> gave an ample te&s;timony to their loyalty, in his declaration 1652, and the Queen-mother acknowledg'd <HI>they had &s;av'd the &s;tate;</HI> and even now, epi&s;copalian bigets can commend <HI>French prote&s;tants,</HI> while they &s;pout &s;candal at Engli&s;h di&s;&s;enters. "An <HI>Imperium in Imperio,</HI>" Sq. <HI>T.</HI> &s;ays, "every wi&s;e common wealth will avoid, if po&s;&s;ible."&mdash;The <HI>Jews</HI> in our SAVIOUR's time (who, tho' he declar'd his <HI>kingdom was not of this world,</HI> was &s;ole <HI>head of the Church</HI>) profe&s;s'd (mighty <HI>loyally,</HI> no doubt!) to act from the &s;ame <HI>wi&s;e</HI> principles of policy; and yet CHRIST was a King, in &s;pite of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> and wou'd have been &s;o even, tho' <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> had declar'd him&s;elf <HI>head of, the Church.</HI></P>
<P>But Sq. <HI>T.</HI> pleads, as meritorious, the privileges of the Church, as well as the prerogatives of the King;&mdash;ju&s;t like a <HI>Whipper,</HI> who, whether he flogs or is kick'd) boa&s;ts, that all is for the good of the public. For the 1&s;t of the Churches privileges (Art. 3d, <HI>viz.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">To TIMOTHY TICKLE, ESQR.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALTHO' I have a natural Di&s;reli&s;h for Controver&s;y, and am far from being moved by any per&s;onal Di&s;regard to the Author of "the Letter to the Bi&s;hop of Landaff;" yet, as a Friend to the Author of the Vindication, and a "Lover of that Truth and Decency, which I think are ju&s;tly pre&s;erved throughout his Pamphlet, I cannot help intere&s;ting my&s;elf in the Di&s;pute. But, notwith&s;tanding the Subject has thus become in|tere&s;ting to me, the Part I &s;hall take in it, will be conducted with Coolne&s;s and Impartiality; it being a Maxim with me, that the Page to which I &s;et my Pen, &s;hall never be &s;tained with the in|famous Blots of Malevolence, or the &s;oul Daubings of the re|lentle&s;s Hand of Party-Zeal.</P>
<P>On reading, and attentively con&s;idering, both the Letter and Vindication, free from Prejudice, I was upon the whole, and as yet am &s;atisfied, that the latter contains a full and complete Re|futation of the former. And what more &s;trongly enforced this Conclu&s;ion upon my Mind, was, that the Arguments of the Vindicator are principally founded on Facts, and his Inferences are &s;uch as naturally re&s;ult from them.</P>
<P>How far the Ingli&s;iana may tend to induce a Change of Sen|timent in me, I know not; but &s;hould there, thro' this Medium, any new Light break from that dark Cloud which now invelopes the Letter, and the favourite Subject e&s;pou&s;ed by it's Author, I &s;hall cheerfully yield to the illuminating Ray. Blinded neither by Prejudice, nor heated with Party-Zeal, I &s;hall always be open to Conviction.</P>
<P>But &s;hould the Whig take up Raillery for Rea&s;on, and &s;ub&s;ti|tute a Play of Wit in the Room of &s;olid Argument; and &s;hould his fir&s;t Number of the Ingli&s;iana, in this Re&s;pect, be characteri&s;|tical of the Re&s;t, he mu&s;t allow me the Privilege (however inferior I may be to him in Point of Wit) of &s;ea&s;oning my An&s;wers to &s;uch of his Papers, with a little Spice of the &s;ame Ingredients. Perhaps my Efforts may be feeble and &s;omewhat aukward, for I claim not Wit as my native Inheritance.</P>
<P><PB N="366" REF="011212_0188_0F862F2A90636B58">What I mean by this is, that &s;hould it &s;o happen, that any of my Remarks may be &s;omewhat keenly edged, the Author of the Letter will excu&s;e me, from this plain Principle of Ju&s;tice, namely, that I have a Right to make u&s;e of &s;uch Kind of Wea|pons as he him&s;elf has brought into the Field. My principal De&s;ign, is however, to adhere clo&s;ely to rea&s;oning upon the Sub|ject, avoiding all per&s;onal Abu&s;e and Invective. If I &s;ometimes range in the airy Region of Fancy, it will be only when my Antagoni&s;t calls me a&s;ide, and takes Po&s;t there; and while we are diverting our&s;elves upon this Ground, I &s;hall not act &s;o mean and ignominious a Part, as to throw dirt in his Face, or be&s;pat|ter him with Calumny. The Support of Truth is the &s;ingle Object I aim at, and I tru&s;t I &s;hall pur&s;ue it with the Candour of an ingenuous Mind.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible, Mr. Tickle, that you have generou&s;ly under|taken to become an Advocate for the Vindicator; and am per|&s;uaded his Cau&s;e could not have been committed to better Hands. &mdash;It is, I confe&s;s, Pre&s;umption in me to think of a&s;king you to permit me to take this Engagement upon my&s;elf. But are you not already engaged in a Work of Importance, that is more general in its Nature, and may not your undertaking to &s;up|port the Vindication, too much break in upon, and interefere with this more exten&s;ive De&s;ign?</P>
<P>Shall I then with your Leave, 'Squire Tickle, &s;tep in as a Vo|luntier to re&s;cue the Character and Abilities of a worthy Clergy|man, from an Attack, which (to &s;ay no wor&s;e of it) is very un|generous? I have the utmo&s;t Confidence that I can &s;hield his Reputation from every A&s;&s;ault, and bring off the Vindication triumphant in the End.&mdash;They both &s;tand upon good Ground, and cannot but be victorious.</P>
<P>In the Pro&s;ecution of my Plan, I propo&s;e to an&s;wer the Num|bers of the Ingli&s;iana regularly, in Mr. Gaine's Gazette. The Title I &s;hall adopt, is that of, The Candid Examiner; and as I conceive the Arguments in the Vindication are fair and conclu|&s;ive, and that it may be defended upon the mo&s;t &s;olid and rati|onal Principles, it &s;hall be my Endeavour to &s;hew, that the Spi|rit which this Paper breathes, corre&s;ponds with the Title under which it appears&mdash;If you approve of my Propo&s;al, you will be plea&s;ed to &s;ignify it by the Publication of this Paper. The next I &s;hall &s;end will be an An&s;wer to the fir&s;t Number of the Ingli&s;i|ana; and I would de&s;ire that it might be publi&s;hed under the Title of, The Candid Examiner, No. I. which I &s;hall conti|nue as Occa&s;ion may require.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Controver&s;y between you and Mr. Whig, after a Con|tinuance of &s;o many Months, &s;eems to be as f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> from a Conclu&s;ion as the warme&s;t Advocate for Contention could wi&s;h; and on the Part of your great Opponent, &s;eems rather about Words than Mea&s;ures; more about what may po&s;&s;ibly, than what is likely to happen; and in a great Mea&s;ure, is an Abu&s;e of the Time and Attention of that Public to whom Dr. Chand|ler &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly and &s;olemnly appeals.</P>
<P>Whatever may be the religious Profe&s;&s;ion of the Writer of this Letter, can be of no Manner of Con&s;equence to you, or Mr. L&mdash;the &s;uppo&s;ed Author of the Whig: Suffice it to &s;ay, that as on the one Hand, Impartiality obliges me to accu&s;e him of wandering from the Path marked out by the Appeal; &s;o, on the other, I cannot conceive there is any Nece&s;&s;ity for &s;o &s;teadily pur|&s;uing him thro' that Thicket in which he &s;eems, if not lo&s;t, yet very near benighted. For his ob&s;tinate Per&s;everance in a a Road &s;o foreign to the real Que&s;tion of the Debate, no Doubt his own Con&s;cience frequently condemns him; but, be that as it may, to pur&s;ue him through all his &s;ini&s;ter Turnings and Windings, would be rather to lo&s;e Sight of the Subject (as he does) than to convince your Readers of the Legality and Pro|priety of the Church's Petitions.</P>
<P>Allow me now to point out to Mr. Whig, what is not, and then, in a few Words, to &s;hew what is the Que&s;tion before a Pub|lick, who will not be &s;wayed by pompous Declarations, and round A&s;&s;ertions, altogether foreign to the Bu&s;ine&s;s in Hand.</P>
<P>It is not indeed, Mr. Whig, it is not the Matter, Whether or no Bi&s;hops, like other Men, are fond of good Living, and with the rich Man upon Record, would choo&s;e to "fare &s;umptuou&s;ly every Day;"&mdash;it is not whether the Epi&s;copalians are to provide their Lord&s;hips a Palace, or two, that will co&s;t three or &pound;.400.000, or whether they are to dwell in Fi&s;hermen's Cottages, as once did their Predece&s;&s;ors;&mdash;it is not whether their Sleeves are gene|rally made of Home&s;pun, Lawn, or Crocus;&mdash;it is not whether they wear &s;quare or round, Ca&s;tor or Beaver Hats;&mdash;it is not what Per&s;ecutors Bi&s;hops may have been, when Super&s;tition and Bigottry over-&s;pread the Chri&s;tian World;&mdash;it is not whether they will go to Meeting-Hou&s;es and Conventicles, and chant Hymns through their No&s;es; or whether with

<HEAD>[From Mr. PARKER'S GAZETTE, Jan. 9, 1769.] The AMERICAN WHIG, [No. XLIV.]</HEAD>
<P>WHETHER Dr. Chandler means to &s;upport the proofs he adduces in &s;avour of an epi&s;copacy in general, or only tho&s;e for an American epi&s;copate in particular. I am at a lo&s;s to determine. If only the latter&mdash;his challenge is too general; and a proper explanation had been kind to him&s;elf as well as to his opponents: To him&s;elf, as it would have &s;aved him the trou|ble of entering into a di&s;pute to which he cannot expect to give a better i&s;&s;ue than has heretofore been given; to them as it would have &s;pared the repetition of old an&s;wers to worn-out ar|guments&mdash;Was it nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould fir&s;t confirm the Epi&s;|copalians in the belief, that the office of a prelate in his &s;en&s;e, was of divine original? Do they need his confirmation? Or is it not evident that he has &s;ome other end in view? Under the nation of a mere preamble, which did not enter into the e&s;&s;ence o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his plan, but &s;erved only as an introduction, he artfully aims a &s;troke, at all other denominations of Chri&s;tians in America; and on pretence of only favouring an American Epi&s;copate, he de&s;igns to make pro&s;elytes to the church of England. The &s;cheme i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ufficiently &s;ubtil, and managed with tolerable art; but is &s;till obnoxious to many objections, which by his own challenge he is bound to obviate, whenever produced.</P>
<P>Whether he intended it or not, his manner of writing has engag'd him in the di&s;pute between the church of England and other Churches; and his public defiance not having made this an exception, he had need to arms.</P>
<P><PB N="371" REF="011212_0190_0F862F2CBB8CFEC0">His fir&s;t &s;ection is call'd "A &s;ketch of the arguments in fa|vour of Epi&s;copacy." And indeed he has given us in a &s;mall compa&s;s, all the arguments of any weight that the church of England has ever produced; or can produce, for her unhappily defering in di&s;cipline from all the other prote&s;tant churches un|der Heaven. But his title page is too general for his purpo&s;e, and &s;o is his plan of Arguments. Why does he follow the old track, and give us a defence of Epi&s;copacy, when in no wi&s;e requi&s;ite? Why did he not rather attempt to &s;upport it, as e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in England, and de&s;ired by him in America, than pro|ceed to defend it in general? But it has ever been the art of the writers of the church of England in this controver&s;y, to avoid the plain definition of Epi&s;copacy in their &s;en&s;e, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from what the other reformed churches mean by it. This gen|tlemen has imitated them. His whole &s;ucce&s;s depends upon keeping this di&s;tinction out of &s;ight. Let it be but fairly made, and it will be found, that his &s;ketch of arguments, wherever they are tolerably true, concludes as &s;trongly in favour of his oppo&s;ers, as of him&s;elf. The u&s;ual method is to &s;et out and d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ead epi&s;copacy in general, to declare them&s;elves advocates for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> being of Bi&s;hops in the church,&mdash;to plead for them by ar|guments from &s;cripture,&mdash;to cite regiments of fathers in &s;up|port of things never denied by the other churches, viz. <Q>That in the church there is the office of a Bi&s;hop,&mdash;that this office is &s;uperior to mere pre&s;byters,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The reader will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ere di&s;tingui&s;h between tho&s;e pre&s;byters that preach, and tho&s;e who are employed for other purpo&s;es.</HI></NOTE>&mdash;and the over&s;ight of the church is committed to them.</Q> Having plain proofs for the&s;e things, they exhibit them under the notion of their being deanied; they exhibit them I &s;ay,&mdash;they fight the phantom them|&s;elves created,&mdash;they beat it down,&mdash;they trample it in the du&s;t, &mdash;they triumph in the conque&s;t. Thus it is with Chillingworth, who has demon&s;trated a thing which no intelligent pre&s;byterian ever denied; and thus with the writer on my table.</P>
<P>Are the other reformed churches enemies to epi&s;copacy? No. &mdash;they contend for it as much as doth the Doctor's &s;ketch. Do they deny the &s;uperiority of a Bi&s;hop to a mere pre&s;byter or elder? No,&mdash;they give in&s;tances of it almo&s;t univer&s;ally. Do they refu&s;e to acknowledge three degrees of office in the church? No.&mdash;there is &s;carce a pari&s;h without its Bi&s;hop.&mdash;its elders, and its deacons. Now to argue again&s;t tho&s;e churches by the proof of the&s;e things in general terms! What is it but an unfair me|thod of rea&s;oning, to deceive the unwary?
<PB N="372" REF="011212_0191_0F862F2E120C1A18">the controver&s;y mu&s;t turn in his favour. But it will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ver be hard for the Doctor to convince men of &s;en&s;e, that when he has clearly demon&s;trated the nece&s;&s;ity of Bi&s;hops in the church, he has ef|fectually proved, that a Bi&s;hop on the Engli&s;h plan, is of divine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="7 letters">ment. All the other reformed churches, 'tis true, refu&s;e to admit a Bi&s;hop over Bi&s;hops, but they do not refu&s;e epi&s;co|pacy. They find nothing in holy writ to warrant &s;uch an enor|mous hierarchy, which only wants a Pope to complete it, "from the dirt to the &s;kies." Nor do they dread all the <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> ex|communications thundred out by the canons of that church, again&s;t all who cannot &s;hape their judgment and con&s;ciences to &s;uch an un&s;criptural prodigy.</P>
<P>This writer would have done well not to have &s;pent his &s;ketch in proving, that <Q>Bi&s;hops are an order in the church &s;uperior to Pre&s;byters merely &s;o,&mdash;that they have the powers of go|vernment and ordination.</Q> The man who wages war with no-body, let him fight ever &s;o valiantly, cannot be called an hero. Let him not take it ami&s;s, if I &s;hould pre&s;cribe him a ta&s;k not &s;o ea&s;y, but more to his purpo&s;e, i.e. after he has hone&s;tly di&s;tingui&s;hed between a dioce&s;an and a parochial Bi&s;hop,&mdash;to de|mon&s;trate, that the former is more agreeable to the word of God, than the latter; or (if he plea&s;es) more agreeable to his venerable St. Ignatius, who&s;e &s;acred authenticity he is willing to defend, by comparing one of equal degree, and &s;uperior li|terary merit to him&s;elf, with the hypocondriacal Hardouin, and who&s;e arguments again&s;t this apo&s;tolical Saint, are beyond the ability of this or any other writer to an&s;wer: except by ridicule, which him&s;elf allows is not a te&s;t. I &s;ay, let him prove by St. Ignatius, that a dioce&s;an is more con&s;i&s;tent with the plan of the go&s;pel, than a parochial Bi&s;hop. His Saint will tell him, that <Q>It is a Bi&s;hop's duty "to know the &s;tate of his flock" &s;o mi|nutely, as to become acquainted (not merely with the heads of families) but with the &s;ervant maids and others of the hou&s;e.</Q> I wou'd therefore demand, whether tho&s;e epi&s;tles even allowed to be genuine, the Doctor can &s;hew, that their au|thor had any idea of &s;uch a dioce&s;s, as that of the Bi&s;hop of London, or as all America would make? Or whether he &s;up|po&s;es, that a Bi&s;hop ought to be endowed with omnipre&s;ence, an attribute of deity? Let him &s;hew, that the erecting a Bi&s;hop, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">perintended a thou&s;and other mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, and to go|vern a thou&s;and pari&s;hes.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At the council of Nice, under Con&s;tantine, there were many Bi&s;hops who were not able to write their own names, as appears <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the minutes of that council.

<PB N="373" REF="011212_0191_0F862F2E120C1A18">of the go&s;pel, than the erection of a Bi&s;hop over one pari&s;h only, to be equal to his brethren, and capable of knowing the &s;piri|tual &s;tate of his flock. Nay, I could wi&s;h he had gone farther, and attempted to prove, what never has yet been proved to &s;a|tisfaction,&mdash;that for &s;uch "a truly &s;cripture Bi&s;hop," we mu&s;t be dependant upon our mother country, as we are for other tax|able commodities,&mdash;that we mu&s;t have a bill di&s;puted in Par|liament, creating him one, or at lea&s;t giving him juri&s;diction over us, without our con&s;ent:&mdash;that the King of England, as "head of the church," has a right to choo&s;e for us; as if we were not of age, nor competent to choo&s;e for our&s;elves. I do not mean to a&s;k him to &s;hew me that the&s;e things are <Q>originally and e&s;&s;entially belonging to the office;</Q> he has put us in mind that we &s;hould be careful <Q>to &s;eparate the &s;everal things that have been added as appendages,</Q> &amp;c. But to &s;hew that it is bet|ter for us to have one Bi&s;hop with all this enormous load of ap|pendages, this unweildly ma&s;s of lumber, than to have a thou|&s;and as good upon the &s;imple plan of the go&s;pel, and <Q>who call no man ma&s;ter;</Q> to have one, for who&s;e creation all England, Scotland, and Wales mu&s;t vote, before we can have him, and in who&s;e election and creation, we cannot have the common privilege of Engli&s;hmen, of Chri&s;tians, or of men; but mu&s;t &s;ubmit to tho&s;e who have nothing to do with us in this matter.&mdash;Let the Doctor &s;hew, that this is more &s;criptural and eligible, than to have many who can &s;hew as much authority from Chri&s;t, as his Lord&s;hip, when he comes, tho' they are &s;trip|ped of tho&s;e anti-chri&s;tian appendages, and cho&s;en by our&s;elves. I boa&s;t my&s;elf a non-epi&s;copalian, for the &s;ame rea&s;on that I boa&s;t my&s;elf an Engli&s;hman; nor can I &s;ee half &s;o much rea|&s;on why we &s;hould &s;ubmit to tyranny in the church, as in the &s;tate.</P>
<P>Allow us, I &s;ay, the di&s;tinction between a dioce&s;an and paro|chial
<PB N="374" REF="011212_0192_0F862F2E9F579710">epi&s;copate,&mdash;allow us to judge from &s;cripture, what a Bi&s;hop means, and we are ready to &s;ub&s;cribe to the mo&s;t of the Doctor's "&s;ketch of arguments." The mo&s;t of it, I &s;ay, be|cau&s;e there are &s;ome exceptions, to which I am amazed that he can &s;ub&s;cribe him&s;elf.</P>
<P>That he &s;hould, for in&s;tance, adopt that quotation from the offices, by which the function of a pre&s;byter and prie&s;t is con|founded. If one views the Church of England as but had pu|rified from the corruptions of popery; if one traces the hi&s;tory of its reformation, and con&s;iders the many impediments which ob&s;tructed its progre&s;s, one will not wonder at finding the name and office of a prie&s;t, as well as an altar retained, when the ab|horred doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, or <Q>the &s;acrifice of the real body and &s;oul of Chri&s;t,</Q> in the euchari&s;t was di&s;carded. But &s;ure, to one who is acquainted only with his bible, the in|con&s;i&s;tency of retaining the one and dropping the other, mu&s;t appear very glaring. The office of a prie&s;t under Chri&s;t, is un|known to &s;cripture, as much as the offering of &s;acrifices. Upon the popi&s;h plan, the office is indi&s;pen&s;ible; upon that of the church of England, it is ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>To &s;u&s;pect any material alteration in the plan of church go|vernment, during the "fir&s;t, &s;econd, or third centuries," is ac|cording to this writer, an argument of <Q>a wrangling and cap|tious di&s;po&s;ition.</Q> And yet him&s;elf furni&s;hes us with an in|&s;tance of a di&s;pute called the quarto-deciman controver&s;y, which proves that within that time, &s;uch was the character of Chri&s;|tians, as to &s;uffer them to &s;eparate from each other, and tear the church to pieces, upon &s;o very a trifle, as the <Q>time of the ob|&s;ervance of E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ter;</Q> a mere &s;uper&s;tition or in&s;titution never commanded by the word of God! This methinks &s;hews, in &s;pite of what the Doctor had &s;aid; that their character was not &s;uch as to oppo&s;e all innovations; &s;ince they not only con&s;ented to this in&s;titution of men, but were &s;o attached to it, as to quarrel about the time of it to a furious degree.</P>
<P>We know, that even in the time of the Apo&s;tles, many cor|ruptions in doctrine did ari&s;e, and were oppo&s;ed by them. We know that very &s;oon after them, the mo&s;t damnable here&s;ies did &s;pring up and &s;pread. No one will deny this, or I would a&s;&s;ign in&s;tances. The Apo&s;tle warns them of "evil men and &s;educers." Now if the character and per&s;ecuted &s;tate of the primitive Chri&s;|tians, was no &s;ecurity again&s;t corruption in doctrines, much le&s;s in di&s;cipline and government.</P>
<P>Simple una&s;piring, un&s;u&s;picious men, as were the primitive Chri&s;tians, were more expo&s;ed to the de&s;igns of ambition, in the article of government, than in matters of faith. Will the ap|pellant
<PB N="375" REF="011212_0192_0F862F2E9F579710">di&s;pute this? The event proves it a fact. To what do|mination did many Bi&s;hops ari&s;e within the &s;pace of 400 years! The man of Sin, is to this day a monument of the &s;upreme height to which this ambition has mounted. Time was when he a&s;&s;umed to him&s;elf more power, than was ever claimed by Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf; and above half the world &s;ub&s;cribed to the abomination; the world "went wondering after the bea&s;t." In the Church of Scotland, or any church &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed, where the powers of church officers and all manner of di&s;cipline have been &s;o thoroughly &s;ifted, and where the reformation occa&s;ioned &s;o many conte&s;ts, it would not be &s;urpri&s;ing to find an innova|tion of this kind vigorou&s;ly oppo&s;ed. But let the Doctor &s;hew us that this ca&s;e is parrallel to that of the primitive Chri&s;tians, who tho' they might be well informed of doctrines nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation yet might not in general have equally under&s;tood the nature of government; as this was a le&s;s e&s;&s;ential point in their view, and at that time not &s;o thoroughly weighed. Where a plan is &s;ettled after long conte&s;t, the lea&s;t attempt to innovate gives loud alarm: where there never was a conte&s;t on this head,&mdash;men may &s;teal by un&s;u&s;pected degrees into dominion, until the multitude find the yoke to fa&s;t wreathed to get it off. So that we need not &s;u&s;pect the zeal of the primitive Chri&s;tians, and yet allow that there were innovations.</P>
<P>Our author would have us produce the hi&s;tory of the time, when all the Chri&s;tian church did tamely re&s;ign their privileges, and how this was accompli&s;hed without the mo&s;t violent convul|&s;ions? I a&s;k him with the &s;ame rea&s;on to &s;hew me the hi&s;tory, and to account for the prodigy, how one Bi&s;hop upon his plan, began to u&s;urp over another&mdash;And pray let him tell me, how it happened at la&s;t, without the mo&s;t dreadful convul&s;ions, that one Bi&s;hop a&s;&s;umed the whole power, and became the <Q>vicar of the &s;on of God?</Q> The &s;ame rea&s;ons which will account for one man's arriving at the &s;upremacy of the whole church, will certainly account for one ambitious man's obtaining the power of "lording it over ten of his brethren." In plain words, the &s;ame rea&s;ons will account for the ri&s;e of dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy, which will account for the ri&s;e of an univer&s;al bi&s;hoprick or pope|dom. For it is full as ea&s;y to tell how a man got upon the lower round of the ladder, as how he a&s;cended to the top. As for hi&s;tory, it gives us as much light in the one ca&s;e, as it doth in the other. The truth is, that ambitious eccle&s;ia&s;ticks a&s;&s;umed, and the civil authority finding it for its advantage, confirmed the tyranny.</P>
<P>It is on all hands granted that the mighty di&s;&s;ention between Bi&s;hops. Metropolitans, Archbi&s;hops, Primates, Patriarchs and
<PB N="376" REF="011212_0193_0F862F34F296E998">Popes, did not &s;pring up in the church in a moment. This grand portent was not the birth of a night; but gradually aro&s;e and gain'd &s;trength for a long time before it came to its cri&s;is. The Dr. indeed in&s;i&s;ts that the fir&s;t three centuries were clear of corruption. But the form of government in the church, was neverthele&s;s greatly changed before the end of the fourth, or el&s;e the Church of England, cannot pretend to be in the right &s;o much as the Church of Rome. But what rea&s;on could operate in the fourth, that did not al&s;o operate in the third century? If an innovation would have alarmed in the &s;econd, why &s;hould it not in the fifth century? If hi&s;torians would have given us the particular account in the third century, why did they not in the fourth? Before the end of the fourth, it is certain, the a&s;piring prelates had got almo&s;t to their <HI>ne plus ultra,</HI> and yet no par|ticular account of it, as a &s;udden thing. Therefore, tho' I ad|mire the language of Chillingworth, in his boa&s;ted demon&s;tra|tion, and e&s;pecially the pa&s;&s;age cited by our author; yet I cannot admire his rea&s;oning. Let us try, whether it will not e&s;tabli&s;h popery as well as dioce&s;an epi&s;copacy; by only putting the &s;ame argument into the mouth of a Je&s;uit.</P>
<P><Q>When I &s;hall &s;ee therefore all the fables in the metamorpho&s;is acted, and prove true &s;tories; when I &s;hall &s;ee all the ari&s;tocracies in the world lie down and &s;leep, and awake into monarchies; then will I begin to believe, that the epi&s;copal government (as it obtains in the Church of England) having continued during the Apo&s;tle's times, and for three hundred years after it,&mdash;&s;hould pre&s;ently after, again&s;t the Apo&s;tle's doctrine, and the will of Chri&s;t, be whirled about like the &s;cene in a ma&s;que, and transformed into papacy. In the mean time, while the&s;e things remain thus incredible, and in human rea&s;on impo&s;&s;i|ble, I hope I &s;hall have leave to conclude thus:</Q></P>
<P><Q>The papal juri&s;diction is acknowledged to have been received into the church, not very long after the third century.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But between the end of this third century, and this not very long after, there was not time enough, nor po&s;&s;ibility of &s;o great an alteration.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And therefore there was no &s;uch alteration as is pretended: and therefore the papacy being confe&s;&s;ed to be &s;o ancient and catholick<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> mu&s;t be granted al&s;o to be apo&s;tolick.</Q></P>
<P>The rea&s;oning is as good in the one ca&s;e as the other. But if you grant that the papal power aro&s;e gradually, and in an un|alarming manner, the &s;ame an&s;wer is &s;ufficient to account for the immoderate ri&s;e of epi&s;copal power.</P>

<P>I am much oblig'd to <HI>Dordracen&s;is</HI> for lending me an helping ha&mdash;foot, as he has thereby &s;av'd me the trouble of <HI>kicking</HI> Sq. <HI>T</HI>'s 34th No. to pieces.&mdash;I mu&s;t however beg his pardon, for anticipating him by a few remarks on <HI>Chillingworth's Demon|&s;tration of the apo&s;tolical in&s;titution of epi&s;copacy,</HI> as given us by Sq. <HI>T.</HI> (No. 35.) This boa&s;ted demon&s;tration is founded entirely on a &s;uppos'd conce&s;&s;ion of <HI>Molinaeus</HI> and <HI>Theodorus.</HI> Until I &s;ee tho&s;e writers, I can't judge for my&s;elf of their real &s;enti|ments, and therefore mu&s;t in the mean time make the be&s;t of Sq. <HI>T</HI>'s "THIRD-<HI>hand</HI> account," from which however, it &s;eems very natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that by <Q><HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> pre&s;ently after the Apo&s;tle's times,</Q> <HI>Molinaeus</HI> meant no more than Dr. <HI>Chauncey</HI> does by <HI>primi interpares,</HI> As to <HI>Theodorus,</HI> if he ad|mitted

<P><HI>Chillingworth</HI> might have &s;par'd much of what he has &s;aid in proof of the 2d. of his premi&s;es, amounting to this, that the work of a <HI>century</HI> cannot be done in a <HI>year;</HI> for if <HI>Molinaeus</HI> and <HI>Theodorus</HI> were indeed &s;o complai&s;ant as to grant his 1&s;t, he need not to have fear'd that any one, who knows that <HI>Rome was not</HI> (as to either city, &s;tate or CHURCH) <HI>built in a day,</HI> wou'd di&s;pute his 2d.&mdash;but on certain occa&s;ions, men love to harrangue on evident points rather than others.

<HEAD>From Mr. GAINE'S GAZETTE, Jan. 16, 1769. A WHIP for the AMERICAN WHIG. By TIMOTHY TICKLE, ESQR. [No. XL.]</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><P>This Heap is much in Show, but light in Sub&s;tance.</P>
<BIBL><HI>Bp. JEWEL.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHEN I entered the Li&s;ts with the American Whig, I really expected that I was to engage with a potent Adver|&s;ary; that I &s;hould have Rea&s;on and Argumentation in every Paragraph: I was al&s;o much plea&s;ed with the Pro&s;pect of ha|ving the "dry Cru&s;ts of Controver&s;y" mollified by Strokes of Wit and Humour, at proper Intervals. But, how great has been the Di&s;appointment, both to my&s;elf and the Public!&mdash;In&s;tead of Rea&s;oning, we have been pre&s;ented with Sophi&s;try; in&s;tead of Argumentation, with Mi&s;repre&s;entation; in&s;tead of Wit and Humour, with Scurrility and Buffoonery;&mdash;Impudence has been obtruded upon as for "&s;ound Sen&s;e; Pertne&s;s," for Sprightline&s;s; a quaint canting Style, for manly Eloquence; Pedantry, for Erudition, and Fal&s;hood, for Truth.&mdash;I am therefore not at all &s;urpri&s;ed, at the Contempt with which his Papers are treated by the Public. Nay, I find that I my&s;elf am, in Danger of being neglected, for attending &s;o clo&s;ely upon his Productions: And the general Opinion &s;eems to be, that <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Tickle <Q>might employ him&s;elf better, than in making Remarks upon Papers that Nobody reads.</Q> For this Rea&s;on the Ame|rican Whig mu&s;t not take it ami&s;s, if I &s;ometimes am obliged to take three or four of his Papers into Con&s;ideration, in order to furni&s;h one tolerable Entertainment to the Public.</P>
<P>In his XXI Numb the American Whig again enters on the Subject of the Expence of American Bi&s;hops; but in a <Q>Man|ner &s;o angry, and with a Temper &s;o inflamed by Pa&s;&s;ion,</Q> that what he &s;ays on the Subject, de&s;erves the le&s;s Attention. Speaking of Dr. Chandler, he &s;ays,&mdash;<Q>Indeed, in no other In|&s;tance &s;hould I di&s;credit his Word:</Q>&mdash;But before he had got half through his Paper, he is fired with Pa&s;&s;ion, which ri&s;es &s;o high, that the atrabilious Humour is put into the mo&s;t <Q><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">u&s;tra|tious Ferments,</Q> and the Doctor is painted as a <Q>tergiver|&s;atious, hypocritical, arrogant Claimant, for Civil Power, and worldly Riches:</Q>&mdash;Is de&s;cribed, <Q>as &s;muggling into Port this contraband Commodity,</Q> viz. American Bi&s;hops, in
<PB N="380" REF="011212_0195_0F862F36EA743D88">a <Q>&s;neaking, mealy-mouthed, half-choaked, he&s;itating, claim|ing, di&s;claiming, avowing, bungling Manner.</Q></P>
<P>Again, &s;peaking of the Dr. and the Convention, he &s;ays,&mdash;<Q>For be&s;ides the extreme Stupidity of confiding in the Promi&s;es of this Sort of Gentry, when a darling Project is to be car|ried, any longer than they labour under an Incapacity of breaking them, it having been their con&s;tant Practice to vio|late tho&s;e kind of Engagements, whenever their De&s;igns were &s;ufficiently matured to defy Oppo&s;ition, (as &s;hall hereafter be abundantly &s;hewn from Hi&s;tory,) it is evident, from their pre&s;ent Conduct, that a primitive Bi&s;hop is as far from their Thoughts, as primitive Chri&s;tianity.</Q>&mdash;When a Writer thus gives him&s;elf up to intemperate Anger, and can &s;o utterly dive&s;t him&s;elf of all Regard to Truth, Decency, and good Manners, in&s;tead of meriting an An&s;wer, he becomes the ju&s;t Object of Contempt.</P>
<P>With Regard to the Expence of American Bi&s;hops, I have in my 31&s;t Num. inconte&s;tably proved, that no Tax will be needed; a Fund is already provided, and daily increa&s;ing; a Fund e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by the pious Donations and Legacies of &s;ome of the worthie&s;t Men that England has produced. This outrageous Clamour which this "te&s;ty, petulant Reviler," hath made, and which he hath wearied him&s;elf in endeavouring to propagate, is only intended to rai&s;e an Odium again&s;t American Bi&s;hops; and if I thought the Whig him&s;elf believed it, or that there was one Per&s;on in the Province, "above the Capacity of an Idiot," who paid any, the lea&s;t Regard to the vi&s;ionary Tax-bill, with which the Whig's &s;econd Sight has tormented him, (in which he has omitted the Article of Bibles, imagining, po&s;&s;ibly, that as little U&s;e is made of the Bible in the Church, as in a Meeting-Hou&s;e,) I would enter into a particular Examination of it. But till I am convinced of this,&mdash;and I mu&s;t have better Proof than either the Whig's Word, or that of his footy Fellow-Scribblers,&mdash;I choo&s;e to leave it, and the Remainder of this Paper, to be a Monument (as long as it la&s;ts) of his implacable Oppo&s;ition to the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church of the Nation, and the venerable Mini&s;|ters of God's true Religion. I &s;hall ju&s;t take the Liberty to a&s;k the Whig, Whether, The Rev. Mr. Williams, who had been Rector of Yale-College, was not promoted to the Command of a Regiment, in the Expedition again&s;t Cape-Breton, in the Year 1745; if that was the Ca&s;e, he might have mentioned it as another In&s;tance, be&s;ides Rector Sharp, of an Eccle&s;ia&s;tic having a military Promotion.</P>
<P>The Whig labours hard, in his XXII Numb. to e&s;tabli&s;h a Point of the greate&s;t Importance to him&s;elf, and the Cau&s;e he
<PB N="381" REF="011212_0195_0F862F36EA743D88">has undertaken to manage, viz. That Dr. Chandler, Mr. Sea|bury, and the Convention, do not de&s;ire, and are not endeavour|ing to obtain &s;uch a Bi&s;hop as is propo&s;ed in the Appeal, or in other Words, a primitive Bi&s;hop, but a <Q>modern, proud, Law-dignified, Court-favoured Prelate.</Q> It is remarkable that the Whig has indulged him&s;elf, thro' the whole Cour&s;e of his Wri|tings, in a mo&s;t flagrant Piece of Sophi&s;try.&mdash;Dr. Chandler and Mr. Seabury have declared, that they them&s;elves, and the Convention, have applied for, and de&s;ire only a primitive Bi&s;hop, i. e. a Bi&s;hop who&s;e Powers &s;hall be of a &s;piritual Kind, &s;uch as are derived from the Church and not from the State. It is &s;ufficiently known, that according to the Principles of the Church of England, and the whole Tenor of Scripture, Bi&s;hops are an Order &s;uperior to Pre&s;byters; and &s;uch an Order &s;uperior to Pre&s;byters, it is, that the Clergy of this Country have applied for;&mdash;an Order, who are to or|dain and govern the Pre&s;byters of a certain di&s;trict, and to confirm &s;uch of the Laity as de&s;ire to be confirmed. The Whig hath repeatedly declared, that there are no Objections again&s;t Primitive Bi&s;hops being &s;ettled in America; but then he con&s;iders every Pre&s;byter as a primitive Bi&s;hop; and an Order of Men in the Church, &s;uperior to Pre&s;byters, he con&s;iders as an Innovation. Under Cover of this Sophi&s;try he hath repeat|edly declared, that it is impo&s;&s;ible we &s;hould have a primitive Bi&s;hop; becau&s;e he would refu&s;e to give that Apellation to any Per&s;on, who was of an Order &s;uperior to Pre&s;byters:&mdash;From the &s;ame Source his mo&s;t amazing Kindne&s;s and Indulgence to the Epi&s;copalians has proceeded:&mdash;"The Epi&s;copalians," &s;ays he in his Number,&mdash;<Q>may have I doubt not, a thou&s;and primitive Bi&s;hops, without Mole&s;tation. They may make every Mi&s;|&s;ionary a Bi&s;hop, without giving any &s;ort of Unea&s;ine&s;s to the Colonies, provided they adhere to the primitive Pattern;</Q> i. e. provided tho&s;e Bi&s;hops are not &s;uperior to Pre&s;byters. The American Whig hath therefore, gro&s;sly impo&s;ed upon his credu|lous Readers, by this Sophi&s;m. He hath dre&s;&s;ed up a Phantom, and has mo&s;t unmercifully belaboured it. Whereas he ought to have &s;hewed the Inconvenience that would have accrued to the Colonies from the &s;ettling one or more Bi&s;hops in them, to or|dain, and govern the Clergy of the American Church of Eng|land, and confirm &s;uch as de&s;ired to be confirmed. Had he done this, or had he endeavoured to have done this, he would have &s;tuck to the Point and the Controver&s;y would before this Time have been at an End. However,</P>
<P>As he hath attempted to <Q>point out &s;undry material Differ|ences, between the primitive Bi&s;hop, and the Bi&s;hop mentioned by Dr. Chandler,</Q> and I will do him the Honour to attend him.</P>
<P><PB N="382" REF="011212_0196_0F862F37A00BA0E8">"1&s;t, The primitive Bi&s;hop" &s;ays the American Whig, was "cho&s;en by the People, over whom he was to pre&s;ide," and for the Truth of this A&s;&s;ertion, he appeals to the Writings of the Fathers, and the Canons of the primitive Church.&mdash;And further on, he a&s;ks, "Is it not a Privilege for the People to choo&s;e their own Bi&s;hops? Why then did Chri&s;t, the great "King and Head of the Church, confer it upon them"?</P>
<P>If the American Whig will con&s;ent, that this Point &s;hall be decided by Te&s;timonies from the Fathers, I will readily join I&s;&s;ue with him; with this Provi&s;o, that his Quotations &s;hall be taken immediately from the Writings of the Fathers, and from the Canons of the primitive Churches, and in the original Language. I will not be &s;atisfied with Quotations of Quota|tions, or Tran&s;lations of Tran&s;lations; particularly I &s;hall ob|ject to any Tran&s;lations, Quotations, or Authorities from St. Peter King's Enquiry; many of which are &s;o very faulty, that a School Boy would have de&s;erved a Flogging for them.</P>
<P>For the pre&s;ent, I ab&s;olutely deny that the primitive Bi&s;hops were cho&s;en by the People; or that Chri&s;t ever conferred this Privilege upon the People. St. Paul, appointed Timothy Bi&s;h|op of Ephe&s;us, and Titus of Crete, without any <Q>popular Suffrage.</Q> When the American Whig produces his Autho|rities for the&s;e A&s;&s;ertions, it will then be Time enough to be more particular.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, The American Whig a&s;&s;erts, <Q>There was one or more primitive Bi&s;hop or Bi&s;hops, in every City or Town, where Chri&s;tianity was profe&s;&s;ed.</Q>&mdash;An&s;. There was one Bi&s;hop in the larger Cities, and in &s;ome Di&s;tricts of the Country; and if, thro' Age or Infirmity, he was unable to di&s;charge the Duties of his Function, an A&s;&s;i&s;tant or &s;uffragan Bi&s;hop was allowed.&mdash;"The Apo&s;tle Paul," continues the Whig, <Q>appointed that there &s;hould be Elders or Bi&s;hops ordained in every City, or Town, of the I&s;land of Crete.</Q>&mdash;An&s;. St. Paul con&s;ecrated Titus Bi&s;hop of Crete, and directed him to ordain Elders, i. e. Pre&s;byters in every City. But if Elders or Pre&s;byters, and Bi&s;hops, are the &s;ame, what Need was there of leaving Titus in Crete, to do that which every Elder or Pre&s;byter might do as well as he? This is an In&s;tance of the Whig's Sophi&s;try, which I took Notice of above. He u&s;es the Words. Elder. i. e. Pre&s;|byter, and Bi&s;hop, as meaning the &s;ame Office; which every Per&s;on who is not as purblind as a Whig, mu&s;t &s;ee is the Point he ought to have proved, and therefore he has no Right to take it for granted.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, <Q>According to primitive In&s;titution, Bi&s;hops were to be apt to teach,</Q> i. e. I &s;uppo&s;e di&s;po&s;ed to teach,&mdash;<Q>and
<PB N="383" REF="011212_0196_0F862F37A00BA0E8">to take heed to all the Flock.</Q>&mdash;he &s;hould have added&mdash;over which the Holy Gho&s;t had made them Over&s;eers,&mdash;i. e. to take the be&s;t Care they could of the whole Di&s;trict, whether greater or le&s;s, that was committed to their Charge,&mdash;<Q>To feed the Church of God. But Dr. Chandler's Bi&s;hop is not to be a con&s;tant Preacher, nor, as far as I can learn from him, to preach the Go&s;pel at all.</Q> But is it not univer&s;ally known and allowed, that one Part of the Bi&s;hop's Office, is to preach the Go&s;pel? Did Dr. Chandler exclude the Bi&s;hop he mentions, from preaching the Go&s;pel? Why then this malicious In&s;inua|tion again&s;t Dr. Chandler? Does not the Governor take Care of the People committed to his Charge, who requires, and &s;ees that the Judges, Ju&s;tices, and every inferior Order of Magi|&s;trates do their Duty: unle&s;s he in his own Per&s;on executes the Office of Judge, Ju&s;tice, Sheriff, Con&s;table, and Hangman, in every City, Town, and Village in his Government? And does not that Bi&s;hop "take heed to the whole Flock," who requires and &s;ees that both Orders of Mini&s;ters under him, do their Duty, and admini&s;ter the Ordinances of Religion, in the various Con|gregations to which they are appointed? Titus was left by St. Paul in Crete, to ordain Elders, Pre&s;byters, or Mini&s;ters, in every City, and to &s;ee that they did their Duty: but St. Paul gave no &s;uch ab&s;urd Direction, as that he &s;hould preach con&s;tantly in every City.</P>
<P N="4">4thly, <Q>The primitive Bi&s;hop was to di&s;cipline all Offenders; &s;uch as &s;inned before all, they were to rebuke before all, that others al&s;o might fear; and to reject Heretics after the fir&s;t and &s;econd Admonition.</Q>&mdash;But according to his <Q>(Dr. Chandler's) Account of his American Bi&s;hop, he is not to di&s;cipline the Laity at all;</Q> &amp;c. To obviate this Objection, I &s;hall here give a &s;hort, but full An&s;wer to the 23d Numb. of the American Whig, which is profe&s;&s;edly upon this very Sub|ject, and contains more Mi&s;repre&s;entations, than any Paper of the &s;ame Length that ever appeared in this Province.</P>
<P>That Excommunication was one Part of the Di&s;cipline of the primitive Church, I believe will not be denied; and the Ame|rican Whig, after complaining bitterly of the &s;evere Effects of Excommunication in the Church of England, endeavours to prove, that the Church of England has no Di&s;cipline at all, and quotes Part of the Exhortation in the Office of Commina|tion, Dr. Whitby, and Bp. Burnet, in Support of his Po&s;ition. But if Excommunication be a more &s;evere Di&s;cipline in the Church of England, than it was in the primitive Church, where is the Sen&s;e of a&s;&s;erting, that the Church of England has no Di&s;cipline at all? I am ready to defend Dr. Chandler's Po&s;i|tion,
<PB N="384" REF="011212_0197_0F862F386ADE4DE0">viz. <Q>That the Power of the Church is entirely Spiri|tual,</Q> &amp;c. But if any civil State &s;hall determine, that a Per|&s;on excommunicated by the Church, &s;hall not be, <Q><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">llowed to commence any Action at Law; nor to be a Witne&s;s, Advo|cate, or Juror, &amp;c.</Q> the Church is no more accountable for the&s;e Con&s;equences, than for the Effects of any other penal Laws pa&s;&s;ed by the State. None of the&s;e Con&s;equences, how|ever, can happen in this Country, becau&s;e there is no Law to give Being to them.</P>
<P>With Regard to the &s;acramental Te&s;t, tho' I am no Lawyer, I am confident no Action at Law would lie again&s;t a Mini&s;ter for r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ing the Communion to any Officer of a &s;candalous Life, and Conver&s;ation; and my Rea&s;on is, that the Rubrics in the Book of Common Prayer, being e&s;tabli&s;hed by Act of Parliament, have the Force of a Law; and it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that a Mini&s;ter would be puni&s;hed by one Law for obeying another.</P>
<P>That the Di&s;cipline of the Church of England is very much weakened, I readily allow; and I think Dr. Chandler has a&s;&s;ign|ed the true Rea&s;on, viz. <Q>Altars are &s;et up again&s;t Altars, and Churches again&s;t Churches; and tho&s;e who are rejected by one, may be received by another.</Q> The Engli&s;h Indepen|dents and Pre&s;byterians mu&s;t take all the Glory and Honour of this to them&s;elves. They rent and divided the Church; they &s;owed the Seeds of Enthu&s;ia&s;m, and Hypocri&s;y, Libertini&s;m, and Infidelity, which have produced a mo&s;t plentiful Harve&s;t: They refu&s;e to &s;ubmit to the Di&s;cipline of the Church, and then cen&s;ure the Church, becau&s;e its Di&s;cipline is not of Force enough to reclaim tho&s;e that are incorrigible; they, by their Clamours and Cabals, by their re&s;tle&s;s Ambition, and unwearied Endea|vours to change the "monarchial Government" of their Country, into a Republic; by <Q>Reflectors, Watch-Towers, American Whig's, and Centinels;</Q> by a <Q>premeditated Oppo&s;ition, and pre-concerted Combination</Q> from Bo&s;ton to Philadelphia; by "A&s;&s;-&s;ociations, Con&s;ociations, Pre&s;byteries and Synods" by Pulpit Harrangues, and private Conver&s;ations; have given, and do give, all the Ob&s;truction in their Power to the Appoint|ment of American Bi&s;hops, and then have the Effrontery to make their Non-appointment an Argument to prove, that the Office of Bi&s;hop in the Church of England, is not the &s;ame with that in the primitive Church.</P>
<P>Thus I have fully confuted three Numb. of the American Whig; and if he or his A&s;&s;ociates, have the lea&s;t Mode&s;ty left, they will never mention this Matter of Di&s;cipline more.</P>
<P>The 6th "Particular of his 22d Numb. is this,&mdash;<Q>The Bi&s;hop of the Appeal, is to be a grand Per&s;onage,</Q> &amp;c. Whe|ther
<PB N="385" REF="011212_0197_0F862F386ADE4DE0">the American bi&s;hops will be of great or &s;mall bulk, the American Whig knows no more than I do; nor whether their "&s;upport and dignity" will be great or little; but when he in&s;inuates, nay affirms, that the Appeal propo&s;es that the A|merican bi&s;hop &s;hould be a 'grand per&s;onage,' and that a 'tax of four-pence' in the &pound;. 100, &s;hould be rai&s;ed for his &s;upport, he knows as well as I, that he in&s;inuates and affirms what is fal&s;e, fal&s;e, fal&s;e.</P>
<P>His triumph over Dr. Chandler, Mr Seabury, Ari&s;tocles, and Hierocles he may enjoy, "if he can;&mdash;only let not him that girdeth on his armour, boa&s;t him&s;elf as he as that putteth it off:" And let him remember, that it ill becomes Whigs, and Independents, to accu&s;e others of 'breach of promi&s;e or forgetfulne&s;s of engagements and prote&s;tations.'</P>
<P>N. B. I have pa&s;&s;ed over No. XX of the American Whig as it is chiefly filled with a pretended letter from "one of the Society's mi&s;&s;ioners in America, to one of his Maje&s;ty's chap|lains." The Whig &s;ays, "the public may depend on it to be genuine." But the public has been &s;o often and &s;o flagrantly abu&s;ed with forgeries by him and his party, (of which the letter &s;igned B.

In the fir&s;t place, I ab&s;olutely deny that the &s;aid letter to one of his Maje&s;ty's chaplains, was written by one of the Society's mi&s;&s;ionaries, and in the next had it been wrote by a mi&s;&s;ionary, I aver there is nothing in it that is unju&s;t, or that may not be well defended. The infamous trade of forgery by the Whig and Co. is at pre&s;ent in a bad &s;tate.&mdash;almo&s;t ruined, to the great &s;atisfaction of all hone&s;t men.</P>

<P>AS the epi&s;copalians in this city, are preparing the way for the better reception of an American Bi&s;hop, by filling our hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives with members of that denomination, or &s;uch as they know to be under their influence, I cannot but think &s;uch their in&s;idious project within the native de&s;ign of your periodical pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">s, which among other &s;alutary purpo&s;es, are doubtle&s;s intended to pre&s;erve this colony from the ab&s;o|lute dominion of high-church.&mdash;For which rea&s;on I per&s;uade my&s;elf, you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> cheerfully in&s;ert the following piece in your paper.</P>
<P><PB N="386" REF="011212_0198_0F862F392B7AEBA0">The epi&s;copalians in this city, having for more than half a cen|tury pa&s;t, regularly and invariably pur&s;ued a confederacy for e&s;tabli&s;hing epi&s;copacy, thro' every part of this province, and &s;teadily pro&s;ecuted this de&s;ign thro' many of their political me|nuvres; a majority of the di&s;&s;enting denominations conceived it high time before they were irremediably en&s;laved by pre|latical tyranny, to make a &s;tand for the pre&s;ervation of their religious liberty, by choo&s;ing for their repre&s;entatives in the next general a&s;&s;embly, men upon whom they could depend as the guardians of their rights and priviledges; and who were not to be influenced by the threats or promi&s;es of their adver|&s;aries.&mdash;To avoid however, the lea&s;t imputation of giving ri&s;e to a conte&s;ted election, if it could be avoided con&s;i&s;tent with a due regard to their political &s;afety, they appointed a committee authori&s;ed to propo&s;e to the two epi&s;copal candi|dates, that the di&s;&s;enters wou'd acquie&s;ce in their appoint|ment and give them their votes, and intere&s;t on condition, that in con&s;ideration thereof, they &s;hould be at liberty to appoint two non-epi&s;copalians, and that &s;uch four &s;hould be elected without any conte&s;t. This propo&s;al was rejected; and the epi&s;coplians are plea&s;ed to wonder for&s;ooth that the affair &s;hould be made a religious quarrel. What follows, is therefore to remove all wonder about the matter; and to &s;hew that if there be any religious quarrel in the ca&s;e, it is of their own making.

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING one of tho&s;e fundamental arti|cles of the 'conditions for plantations,' upon which this country was &s;ettled, publi&s;hed by the Duke of York, is in the&s;e words, "That every town&s;hip &s;hould be obliged to pay their own mini&s;ters, according to &s;uch agreements as they &s;hould make with him; the mini&s;ters being elected by the major part of the hou&s;holders and inhabitants of the town." And notwith|&s;tanding the Dutch were farther expre&s;ly &s;ecured by the faith of the nation, &s;olemnly declared in the 8th article of the capi|tulation at the &s;urrender of this province, by them, to the crown of England, on the 27th Augu&s;t, 1604, that "the Dutch here

<P>In the year 1702, Governor Cornbury, a violent epi&s;copalian, retired from this city, on account of a very mortal di&s;temper which then raged in it, to the town of Jamaica; and in a friendly manner intreated Mr. Hubbard, for the u&s;e of the par&s;onage hou&s;e, during his &s;tay there.

<P>The&s;e my friends and fellow citizens are facts, &s;tubborn and inconte&s;tible facts, And now I appeal to the &s;ober judgment of every impartial man, to determine whether (if &s;o it mu&s;t be call'd) we or they have made it a religious quarrel. We are di&s;affected to no man, of any Chri&s;tian per&s;ua&s;ion on account of his religious &s;entiments. Nor are we prejudiced again&s;t any epi&s;copalian for his religion.&mdash;But it is the politics of the church,&mdash;its domineering &s;pirit,&mdash;its perpetual &s;trides towards univer&s;al dominion,&mdash;its pride,&mdash;its power and its thir&s;t of domination, a thir&s;t not to be &s;atiated but by our ab|&s;olute de&s;truction, that we are combined to oppo&s;e. In&s;tead of any machination again&s;t them, I wi&s;h we could an&s;wer for our criminal pa&s;&s;ivity for half a century. Why have all the&s;e things been &s;uffered? Many of them could certainly have been pre|vented, had we not been wanting to our&s;elves. Look around you, my brethren, and the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> tell me what po&s;t or what office is not engro&s;&s;ed by them! Could all this happen by chance in a province where they con&s;titute &s;o &s;mall a minority? not &s;uch a &s;eries of encroachments to be a&s;cribed to a concer|tion of de&s;ign for aggrandizing them&s;elves, and &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the di&s;&s;enters? Rou&s;e therefore my friends, and act like men! Exert your&s;elves in the glorious cau&s;e of pre&s;erving your liber|ties. Tran&s;mit them like an ine&s;timable jewel, to your po&s;|terity. Suffer your&s;elves no longer to be wheedled by their artifices. Let it &s;uffice, and more than &s;uffice us, that hither|to we have &s;lumbered on &s;upine and inactive. They want only a majority in the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives to have all the three branches of the legi&s;lature on the &s;ide of epi&s;copacy: And then farewel, an eternal farewel, to our religious liberty! Then &s;hall we indeed be made, (what one of them within
<PB N="391" REF="011212_0200_0F862F3A9FD62198">the&s;e &s;ix days, had the a&s;&s;urance to &s;ay we ought to be made,) 'Tributaries to the church.' Up therefore, and be doing. If you &s;leep now, you &s;leep as on the top of a ma&s;t, and all beneath you is de&s;truction and ruin. To avert the perdition which threatens you, pre&s;erve inviolate your laudable combination.&mdash;Your only &s;trength con&s;i&s;ts in your union. Let no &s;trata|gem of theirs di&s;concert it. As you have one joint intere&s;t to &s;ecure, act as if in&s;pired by one &s;oul. The pro&s;pect is encou|raging. Providence will not frown on your &s;truggles for liber|ty, Whatever be the i&s;&s;ue, it is ours to u&s;e the means, and then to acquie&s;ce in the di&s;pen&s;ations of Heaven: But indo|lence is certainly culpable. If we &s;ucceed, we &s;hall lay a per|manent foundation for our privileges. If we fall, we glori|ou&s;ly fall, by falling in the vindication of what is dearer than life it&s;elf.&mdash;In a word, &s;hould we be di&s;appointed, let our di&s;appointment be improved, to a &s;till clo&s;er, and more intimate junction. Let it be improved to excite us to exert our&s;elves upon every future occa&s;ion, with greater harmony, and redou|bled vigour.</P>

<P>INCITED by an in&s;atiable lu&s;t of power, and &s;purr'd on by an ambition which increa&s;es in its pro&s;pects, as it advances to an eminence, a turbulent faction in this province, have never

Evidently with this intent was the 24th number of the American Whig written. Dr. Chandler after inconte&s;tably proving that a bi&s;hop under the re&s;trictions propo&s;ed, could be no way detrimental to di&s;&s;enters, and that it is a privilege e&s;&s;ential to the well-being of the church, urges, that any oppo&s;ition of di&s;&s;enters to a plan of &s;o harmle&s;s a tendency, would have in it the nature of per&s;ecution&mdash;From &s;o ju&s;t an a&s;&s;ertion, the American Whig takes occa&s;ion to accu&s;e Dr. Chandler of in&s;inuating that the church had been grievou&s;ly oppo&s;ed by di&s;&s;enters; merely that he might with &s;ome degree of propriety and excu&s;e, inflame their minds by a high colour'd narration of the &s;avage cruelty of churchmen&punc; Strange that a &s;plenetic crew, who &s;ince their fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> origin, have been continually maligning, traducing, and di&s;turbing the quiet of all around them; who, di&s;contented with the fre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t toleration any where granted, are continually di&s;charging their venom at the bo&s;om that nouri&s;hed them; who have never mi&s;s'd one opportunity of per&s;ecuting others, and aiming at the de&s;truction of the church; that &s;uch (I &s;ay) &s;hould not blu&s;h to accu&s;e that religious &s;ociety, the charity and benevolence of who&s;e members is every where acknowledged, and enjoyed by them&s;elves whenever they have petitioned for it.&mdash;The charges contained in this paper, and repeated in the 25th number, I &s;hould with plea&s;ure refute; but the ta&s;k is needle&s;s, &s;ince they have been totally obviated in a late paper,&mdash;are no way coincident with the &s;ubject, and would be improper at this &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>If the church of England in America is con&s;iderably di&s;tre&s;s'd thro' the want of an epi&s;copate to &s;uperintend her clergy, and to confirm her members,&mdash;if half her churches are de&s;titute of clergymen to officiate in them and admini&s;ter the &s;acraments,&mdash;if the epi&s;copate de&s;ir'd, would remedy the&s;e inconveniencies, and be of advantage to religion in general among us, and a&s;&s;i&s;t the propagation of the go&s;pel among the heathen,&mdash;if the bi&s;hop is to be &s;o abridg'd in his powers as that he cannot po&s;&s;ibly in|fringe the privileges of di&s;&s;enters,&mdash;if the&s;e <HI>po&s;tulata</HI> are true, and that they are &s;o, Dr. Chandler has irrefragably evinc'd&mdash;the oppo&s;ition of pre&s;byterians to &s;o rea&s;onable a propo&s;al, is evi|dently cruel, invidious, and malevolent; and betrays a &s;pirit,
<PB N="395" REF="011212_0202_0F86302CE298FEA0">&s;candalous to prote&s;tanti&s;m, and heinou&s;ly criminal and nefarious.</P>
<P>But &s;ays the American Whig, <Q>I am &s;urpri&s;ed that any man, who has re&s;ided but a few years in this country, and e&s;pecially a native, who cannot but be thoroughly acquainted with the genius and di&s;po&s;ition of its inhabitants, towards an eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal hierarchy, &s;hould &s;eriou&s;ly &s;et him&s;elf to urge a mea&s;ure that hath &s;o manife&s;t a tendency to interrupt the peace, impede the population, and re-kindle a flame in his Maje&s;ty's dominions.</Q></P>
<P>This objection is &s;o far from having any truth or &s;olidity in it, and has been con&s;idered &s;o often in the cour&s;e of the&s;e papers, that it &s;carcely de&s;erves attention. The di&s;&s;enters in this coun|try (excepting a trifling minority) with the reform'd Dutch church are &s;o fully convinced of the moderation and benefits re|&s;ulting from the e&s;tabli&s;h'd church, that they would rejoice in any method that could promote her intere&s;ts, without damaging the liberties of others.</P>
<P>An in&s;inuation that 'nine tenths of the colonies' have an un|conquerable aver&s;ion to bi&s;hops, under the re&s;trictions &s;tated by Dr. Chandler, is a calumny that de&s;erves the &s;evere&s;t reprehen|&s;ion. The di&s;&s;enters in this country have imbibed the principles of freedom and moderation: They are not, they cannot be of &s;uch an intolerant &s;pirit, as to refu&s;e a prote&s;tant church the en|joyment of an epi&s;copate that interferes not in their concerns.&mdash;Such a&s;&s;ertions mu&s;t give the enemies of the reformation cau&s;e to rejoice. and a fair plea to doubt of the boa&s;ted mildne&s;s and charity of prote&s;tants. The temporal powers of Engli&s;h bi&s;hops are not con&s;idered as inherent in their office&mdash;they are mere ap|pendages confer'd by the &s;tate (in con&s;equence of the alliance) to be employed in its &s;ervice. The&s;e, if the church is e&s;tabli&s;hed, may be circum&s;crib'd by an act of parliament, and if it is not&mdash;they cannot be exerci&s;ed.</P>
<P>The faith of treaties, the &s;anctity of laws, and the fence of charters, will be the guardian of their privileges.</P>
<P>Where then can be the ob&s;tacle? Can they fear its increa&s;e in &s;trength?&mdash;The well-being, harmony, religious liberty and peace, of the various denominations in America, depend on this circum|&s;tance. The pre&s;byterians are fa&s;t increa&s;ing in number&mdash;un&s;a|tisfied (as they ever will be) with their pre&s;ent large participation of privileges, they are ambitiou&s;ly gra&s;ping for more.</P>
<P>Their a&s;piring leaders pant to &s;eize the chariot of power&mdash;in which if they are once mounted, they will drive furiou&s;ly.</P>
<P>The di&s;&s;enters experience the lenity and mildne&s;s of the go|vernment of churchmen; they find them open hearted and cha|ritable, and in general de&s;pi&s;ing the little views of party. On

<HEAD>From Mr. PARKER'S GAZETTE, Jan. 23, 1769. The AMERICAN WHIG, [No. XLVI.]</HEAD>
<P>LIBERTY is the gift of God to mankind; and a jewel of ine&s;timable value. Had we retained our primitive in|nocence, we &s;hould have enjoyed our primitive liberty. But the introduction of &s;in into the world, introduced the nece&s;&s;ity of putting the &s;word into the hands of the magi&s;trate, to protect the weak from the violence of the &s;trong. Hence the origin of government. We &s;urrender a part of our liberty to &s;ecure the remainder; and thus it appears, that licentiou&s;ne&s;s, or an unruly de&s;ire in any man to do as &s;eems good in his own eyes, is unfriendly to liberty; or in other words, that every true Son of liberty is a friend of good government, and in this con|&s;i&s;ts the glory of that character. The government, I &s;ay, mu&s;t be a good one; for to di&s;turb one that is de&s;tructive of the public felicity, or to oppo&s;e a tyrannical dominion, either origi|nally acquired by force, gradually erected on the ruins of a free &s;tate, can never be called licentiou&s;ne&s;s: For no man or &s;et of men, could ever acquire a right to render the &s;ociety they are appointed to govern, as mi&s;erable as it would have been without any government; and much le&s;s to make the members of it more wretched than they would be in a meer &s;tate of nature. The happine&s;s of the people is therefore the law of laws, the &s;upreme law. And hence it follows on the other hand, that as no government is or can be perfect in its plan, nor always faultle&s;s in the execution of its powers, re&s;i&s;tance is unlawful; unle&s;s, all things con&s;idered, there is a moral certainty of thereby promoting the happine&s;s of the community. The true Son of liberty will therefore abhor both tyranny and licentiou&s;ne&s;s, and think it his duty to oppo&s;e every bad mea&s;ure, whether attempted by prince or people, and conduct his oppo&s;ition with a &s;teady eye to the general good.</P>
<P><PB N="401" REF="011212_0205_0F86302F23416BD0">Upon the&s;e principles we ju&s;tify tho&s;e heroes of our own nation, who with their blood, purcha&s;ed that glorious con&s;ti|tution, which after innumerable &s;truggles, acquired a perma|nent e&s;tabli&s;hment on the acce&s;&s;ion of that ever memorable Dutchman, King William the third. By the&s;e principles al&s;o, the Sons of liberty in America, will be able to vin|dicate their attachment to the con&s;titutional claims of free|born Engli&s;hmen; and the time is fa&s;t approaching when the pre&s;ent threatning clouds, with re&s;pect to the conte&s;ted right of taxation, will be di&s;&s;ipated, to the honour of all tho&s;e who &s;hall appear at the end of tho&s;e troubles, to have been cordial friends to the intere&s;ts of the empire.</P>
<P>But whatever &s;hare any of us may claim in that harve&s;t of glory, let it ever be remembered, that His will be the greate&s;t, who&s;e actions have been conducted upon the mo&s;t generous principles, and with views of promoting the mo&s;t exten&s;ive felicity; and that the man who &s;hall &s;tickle to &s;hut out one evil, and contribute to open a door to a greater, will rather de&s;erve cen&s;ure than applau&s;e.</P>
<P>He who really loves his country, will, to the utmo&s;t of his power watch again&s;t, and prevent every annoyance: But a man who is clamourous again&s;t one ill mea&s;ure, and regardle&s;s of others equally mi&s;chievous, can have no claim to true pa|trioti&s;m: Such only wear it as a cloak to cover &s;ome &s;ini&s;ter de&s;ign: The conduct of &s;ome of tho&s;e who in this city ac|quired honour by their oppo&s;ition to the &s;tamp-act, gives there|fore ju&s;t ground to &s;u&s;pect, that they were not in&s;pired by that laudable &s;pirit, which &s;eeks the redre&s;s not only of one partial grievance, but will exert it&s;elf again&s;t every machination de|vi&s;ed for the ruin and de&s;truction of their country. Let us attend to a few in&s;tances in which the patrioti&s;m of tho&s;e pretenders to the character of &s;ons of liberty, has been brought to the te&s;t; and their claim to it will be found to be emptine&s;s it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Scarce had we concluded our exultation on the repeal of the &s;tamp-act, before we heard of the execrable &s;cheme for en&s;lav|ing the whole continent under the dominion of &s;piritual courts. The Bi&s;hop of Landaff a&s;&s;ures us, that the introducti|on of Prelates into this country, was the main de&s;ign of erect|ing the &s;ociety for propagating the go&s;pel in the reign of King William. Ever &s;ince that period they, have had their eye upon us; and now when the conque&s;t of Canada bids fair for &s;uch an increa&s;e of wealth, as to enable us to &s;up|port the hierarchy, every exertion is made on both &s;ides of the water, to accompli&s;h the project.&mdash;Bi&s;hops preach it up. Legacies are given for it. Our own clergy petition the King,
<PB N="402" REF="011212_0206_0F86302FE0C2B800">the Univer&s;ities, and others in its favour. Private letters are written to &s;olicit the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of men in power, Pamphlets and papers are publi&s;hed to wheedle and deceive the Ameri|cans; and the late Arch-bi&s;hop of Canterbury him&s;elf, under|took to defend the &s;cheme, and in his an&s;wer to Dr Mayhew, who gave the fir&s;t alarm, boldly pre&s;umes without the royal leave, to intimate, that if any colony will &s;ignify its reque&s;t for a Bi&s;hop, a Bi&s;hop &s;hall be &s;ent.</P>
<P>As therefore the &s;ubjugating &s;uch an infant country as this, to dignified prelates, mu&s;t be its inevitable ruin; who would imagine that any per&s;on bearing the name of a &s;on of liberty, would have heard of &s;o portentous and alarming a project, without the mo&s;t painful emotions! Upon all tho&s;e who really de&s;erved that honourable appellation, it had that effect; and the efforts they are making to vindicate the religious liberties of the people, are as vigorous as tho&s;e made in defence of their civil rights and privileges.</P>
<P>Admitting that the wings of the American Bi&s;hops may be &s;o clipped, as to prevent them from doing us any injury; and that &s;uch only are de&s;ired as are of the primitive kind; yet &s;urely it became the profe&s;&s;ed a&s;&s;ertors of liberty, to take pro|per &s;teps to ob&s;truct the &s;cheme till &s;ecurity was given for this clipping, in order that all rea&s;onable jealou&s;y might be re|moved.&mdash;In&s;tead of joining to allay the fears of others, till the remedy was impracticable, they ought to have aided them in driving the zealots for this pernicious plot, not only into a di&s;|avowal of it in words, but from urging it in any manner what|ever, before &s;uch laws were enacted, as might put us out of danger. The proper &s;teps were obvious. One denomination only was &s;u&s;pected to befriend the &s;cheme. The motions of the bigots among them were therefore to be narrowly watch|ed. I &s;ay their <HI>bigots</HI> were to be watched, becau&s;e it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, to the honour of the majority of the epi&s;copalians on the continent, that they are as aver&s;e to prelacy as any other prote&s;tants among&s;t us. And to fru&s;trate the de&s;igns of tho&s;e bigots, the &s;ons of liberty of that church, &s;hould have joined all others in refu&s;ing their votes to any candidate for an elec|tion, who&s;e profe&s;&s;ion of principles afforded any ground for &s;u&s;pecting him a friend to the introduction of prelatic power into America. Nay, they ought upon the fir&s;t notice of &s;uch a de&s;ign, to have petitioned the a&s;&s;embly for a mo&s;t explicit de|claration of our abhorrence of the mea&s;ure, and the mo&s;t ear|ne&s;t &s;upplication to King Lords and Commons, that no &s;uch power might be &s;uffered to di&s;turb the repo&s;e, and con&s;ume the &s;ub&s;tance of this peaceable and pro&s;perous country.</P>
<P>The neglect of all this is truly culpable&mdash;Nay, &s;ome who
<PB N="403" REF="011212_0206_0F86302FE0C2B800">pretend to the character of &s;ons of liberty, &s;eem to act as if they were &s;truggling to arrogate to them&s;elves the name, mere|ly to have the fairer opportunity of de&s;troying the &s;ub&s;tance. They clamour again&s;t the laws de&s;tructive of civil liberty, only to gain a credit and power to rob us of what is infinitely dearer to us, even the privilege of wor&s;hipping God, accord|ing to the dictates of our con&s;ciences, and to make us, as it has been expre&s;&s;ed, <HI>Tributaries to the church.</HI></P>
<P>That the attachment of tho&s;e pretenders to the cau&s;e of liberty, was at be&s;t but partial, appeared inconte&s;tibly evident in the cour&s;e of the la&s;t election for this city.</P>
<P>The real &s;on of liberty will con&s;ider the bu&s;ine&s;s of an election, e&s;pecially at &s;uch a critical juncture, as one of the mo&s;t important concerns in which he can be engaged.&mdash;The freedom of elections is the grand bulwark of all our liber|ties, rights, and privileges, civil and religious; and it is im|pregnable to all attacks except tho&s;e of corruption and terror. But will any man have the a&s;&s;urance to deny, that in the la&s;t elections, at lea&s;t one of tho&s;e batteries was &s;erved, and that too by men who boa&s;t in the name of <HI>Liberty-Boys?</HI> And was not this manife&s;tly to keep out a certain candidate merely for his attachment to the cau&s;e of religious liberty; and becau&s;e his abilities gave the enemies of it, rea&s;on to tremble for their dar|ling &s;cheme of erecting a prelatical domination over all the other churches in the colony?</P>
<P>There is no court to which we ought to re&s;ort with more &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, than the &s;heriff's court of election. To pre&s;erve our liberties and promote the common welfare, we &s;hould our&s;elves behave in it, and a&s;&s;i&s;t in obliging others, to demean them&s;elves, with the greate&s;t decorum.</P>
<P>Every man who offers his &s;ervice to the public as a candi|date, has a right to good u&s;age, and de&s;erves our thanks. Nay, if his offers are countenanced by the voices of any of his countrymen, there is a double re&s;pect due to him; and if he is in&s;ulted, his electors are abu&s;ed, and have rea&s;on to re&s;ent it as an injury done to them&s;elves and the public. But were there none who pretend to be &s;ons of liberty, concerned at the late election, in tumultuous &s;houtings, di&s;playing of colours, and other artifices, de&s;igned to in&s;pire terror into one of the can|didates, or his electors? Was not every part of the town alarmed by exhibitions purpo&s;ely contrived to intimidate the inhabitants who befriended him? Yes, and tho&s;e in&s;ulting ac|clamations were made in the very court of election. Not to mention all the menaces and threats offered to the poor vo|ters, &s;ome of whom were thereby terrified out of their birth-right, and treated as the mo&s;t abject &s;laves, merely on the &s;core of their poverty.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I'M very loth to exerci&s;e my office on any gentleman <HI>per&s;on|ally;</HI> but, if any one <HI>will</HI> imprudently &s;tand in the way of my <HI>toe,</HI> and thereby happens to be <HI>kick'd</HI> I can't help it.&mdash;He mu&s;t blame him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>S&mdash;b&mdash;r&mdash;y</HI> (<HI>Whip</HI> No. 37.) gives us (as <HI>he</HI> &s;ays) 'a ju&s;t and faithful account' of his <HI>adventure,</HI> in que&s;t of the name of the writer of the letter &s;ign'd <HI>B. W.</HI> and after all his ram|bles, concludes, (as, it &s;eems, he did at fir&s;t) that the whole is 'a villanous piece of forgery,' in which <HI>B. W.</HI> Dr. <HI>Chauncy,</HI> Mr. <HI>Parker</HI> and Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> &s;tand charg'd by him as per&s;ons concern'd. Now as I am not acquainted with the nece&s;&s;ary facts, I &s;hall leave it to tho&s;e gentlemen, if they think it nece&s;&s;ary, to vindicate their own characters: In the mean time, as <HI>one &s;tory is</HI> often <HI>good only till another is told,</HI> I advi&s;e the reader to &s;u&s;pend his judgment as I do. I beg leave however to make a few remarks on Mr. <HI>S's. 'performance,'</HI> as he calls it.</P>
<P N="1">1. He gives Mr. <HI>P.</HI> a long &s;tring of titles, evidently out of <HI>pure &s;pite,</HI> being apparently as much di&s;pleas'd with him for <HI>printing,</HI> as with <HI>B. W.</HI> for <HI>writing</HI> the letter. 2. He &s;ays, 'the direction at the head' of it and, <HI>He thinks</HI> 'the date at the Bottom were in a different hand and ink from the other writing.' Had his aim been to prove the authenticity of the letter, per|haps he wou'd have <HI>thinked</HI> otherwi&s;e, at lea&s;t as to the latter; and to the former he wou'd no more have &s;u&s;pected <HI>Forgery,</HI> than he might have done in many a piece &s;ent to the pre&s;s, in|troduc'd with a 'different hand and ink' for the &s;ake of the compo&s;ers. 3. He accu&s;es Mr. <HI>P.</HI> of 'not complying with his promi&s;e in his own preamble:"&mdash;Now Mr. <HI>P. promis'd</HI> no|thing at all, or at mo&s;t no more than to '&s;hew the original letter to any per&s;on de&s;irous of &s;atisfaction.' The letter Mr. <HI>S.</HI> owns Mr. <HI>P. &s;hew'd</HI> him;&mdash;and what wou'd the man have had more? By being trouble&s;ome, 'tis probable he obtain'd the knowledge of Mr. <HI>P's</HI> conjectures as to the author, which right or wrong, he wou'd fain improve to his di&s;advan|tage. 4. Mr. <HI>S.</HI> contradicts him&s;elf. Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> he &s;ays, 'cau|tiou&s;ly avoiding mentioning <HI>Wentworth's</HI> name, but <HI>always</HI> expre&s;s'd him&s;elf by the term&mdash;<HI>the gentleman;</HI>' and yet he
<PB N="405" REF="011212_0207_0F86303104335140">owns Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> mention'd Mr. <HI>Wentworth's</HI> name no le&s;s than <HI>twice</HI> before. On the whole Mr. <HI>S.</HI> &s;eems to have written his hi&s;tory in a great pa&s;&s;ion, to the beginnings of which, I doubt not, &s;ome of the gentlemen accu&s;ed were witne&s;&s;es, as well as the 'gentleman of undoubted credit' his companion, in proof of which as well as other articles, 'tis a pity he did not pro|cure and publi&s;h <HI>his</HI> affidavit.</P>
<P>I come now to con&s;ider M. <HI>S's</HI> reflections on <HI>B. W</HI>'s letter, (<HI>Whip</HI> No. 38) His remarks on the <HI>&s;pirit</HI> and <HI>temper</HI> of it, &s;o naturally put me in mind of <HI>his,</HI> that I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to that alone. He is &s;o much vex'd with <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> that he de|clares he 'never was in it,&mdash;'has no agents in it,'&mdash;'ne|ver wrote a &s;ingle letter to any per&s;on in it,'&mdash;and <HI>'de&s;ires to have nothing to do with it.'</HI> Mighty <HI>good humour'd</HI> this!&mdash;He likewi&s;e 'confidently' boa&s;ts, that he has 'laid the <HI>Whig</HI> fair|ly on his back.' What a pity it is &s;uch a doughty combatant has no trumpeter!</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>S.</HI> &s;eems to think <HI>B. W.</HI> has not acted in character. Not as <HI>a &s;on of the church;</HI> becau&s;e he has ventur'd to reprove &s;ome of her hot-headed children.&mdash;Not as <HI>a friend to</HI> Her <HI>growth;</HI> becau&s;e he &s;corns to promote it by the dirty manure of mi&s;re|pre&s;entation, and is &s;o candid as to do ju&s;tice to Dr. <HI>Chauncy:</HI>&mdash;Not a <HI>member of the &s;ociety;</HI> becau&s;e he declares he is not im|pos'd upon like mo&s;t of his brethren:&mdash;Not as <HI>a friend to de|cency and good manners:</HI> becau&s;e he has treated with &s;ome free|dom, &s;o <HI>very Re&s;pectable</HI> a character as Mr. <HI>S's</HI>&mdash;and, not as <HI>a friend to truth and impartiality;</HI> becau&s;e impartiality, on this occa&s;ion, oblig'd him to take the <HI>part</HI> of <HI>one</HI> of the di&s;&s;enters, and becau&s;e in his whole letter there is not <HI>One word of truth</HI>&mdash;but what is very unwelcome to Mr. <HI>S.</HI> Such a '&s;tickler for <HI>impartiality</HI> in writing' as Mr. <HI>S.</HI> had need to approve him|&s;elf a very candid inquirer after <HI>truth;</HI> and yet <HI>reader!</HI> (cou'd you have thought it?) this &s;ame gentleman, undertakes to decide on the propriety of Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI>'s an&s;wering the <HI>ap|peal,</HI> and ridicules him, as he wou'd <HI>an old hor&s;e,</HI> in the &s;ame breath with which he 'deliberately declares,' that he '<HI>never read more than a dozen pages</HI> in' the <HI>Dr</HI>'s. pamphlet, 'and <HI>never intends to read a dozen more.</HI>' On this occa&s;ion, I &s;hall only remark, that I've known many an <HI>old hor&s;e</HI> worth more than a dozen young&mdash;s</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>S.</HI> affects to be thought too manly to <HI>give any one,</HI> even a &s;ervant, <HI>the lie,</HI> when in effect he had ju&s;t declar'd, that <HI>B. W</HI>'s letter was nothing but a <HI>pack of lies,</HI> and mi&s;repre&s;enta|tions. I hope indeed Mr. <HI>S.</HI> was not the per&s;on, who gave Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI> the lie, July 4th. 1768; but &s;omebody certainly did: And even Mr. <HI>S.</HI> endeavours to ju&s;tify him in it, by in effect
<PB N="406" REF="011212_0208_0F86303169720FC8">declaring that there is not one word of <HI>truth</HI> or impartality in <HI>B. W's</HI> letter.</P>
<P>Whether <HI>B. W.</HI> are the initials of the letter-writer's <HI>Real</HI> name, or were by him &s;ign'd as <HI>W. X. Y. Z. &amp;c.</HI> have been by others. I can't pretend to &s;ay; but it wou'd doubtle&s;s greatly &s;urpri&s;e Mr. <HI>S.</HI> (who has <HI>nothing to do with Bo&s;ton</HI>) to find that &s;ome one of tho&s;e gentlemen he mentions by name, had written the letter, and (whether mi&s;taken or not as to the per&s;on who <HI>ap'd</HI> an <HI>independent</HI>) had acted from nobler motives than Mr. <HI>S.</HI> can, it &s;eems conceive of, <HI>viz.</HI>&mdash;than rev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ge for his having <HI>per|&s;onally</HI> 'given him an occa&s;ion.' How apt &s;ome people are to di&s;cover unwarily the principles of <HI>their own</HI> conduct!
