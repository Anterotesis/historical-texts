<P>IT is the cur&s;e of the Age in which our Lot hath been ca&s;t, that not only men in general think le&s;s of tho&s;e concerns which belong to their permanent tranquillity, than of the carking cares of gain: but, that a very large portion of &s;ociety think not of them at all.</P>
<P>HENCE it ari&s;es, that the public concerns are &s;wayed by characters and by circum|&s;tances, grovelling and in&s;ignificant; that the mo&s;t abject cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety, give law to their ma&s;ters; and that a progre&s;&s;ive de|cline, marks, in painful traces, the funereal progre&s;s of our political career. We &s;eem to have abandoned our&s;elves to the lethargy of the Sloth, and to have crept up the Tree of Apathy, where every murmur of every
<PB N="2" REF="037419_0003_100D2E8A6AEDA3A8">breeze excites a narrow and chilling dread le&s;t our repo&s;e be for a moment annoyed. Our fears, our alarms, are all the emotions of an abject cowardice, impelled by &s;trong circum&s;tance to blink at danger, and then &s;linking into the former &s;tate of &s;luggi&s;hne&s;s 'till again rou&s;ed by new excitements, fruit|le&s;s of all u&s;eful effect as the former. One call to action &s;ucceeds another in ineffectual round, for the la&s;t leaves us where we were found by the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>FROM vi&s;ionary dreams, from fanta&s;tic progno&s;tications and golden hopes, we were rou&s;ed by the phrenzy of the French Revo|lutioni&s;ts, through the in&s;trumentality of their Agent, Genet. A miracle, the forbear|ance of Robe&s;pierre, extricated us mo&s;t un|fortunately from a dilemma, which it was hoped would terminate in a declaration of war on the part of that extraordinary mon|&s;ter. But the whim of Robe&s;pierre, and our ill &s;tars conjoined, cut us off from a con|tingency &s;o devoutly to be wi&s;hed: a con|tingency which mu&s;t inevitably have pre|cluded
<PB N="3" REF="037419_0004_100D2E8D3576D038">all tho&s;e unhappy calamities which have &s;ince been brought upon the country. But, this danger evaded, we &s;lept again, as|&s;umed the wreath of Meconium, and aban|doned our&s;elves in &s;uch confidence to re|po&s;e, as if &s;ecurity and thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s were the only attributes with which we were endowed, the only characteri&s;tics of our natures.</P>
<P>THE conceptions of illu&s;trious men, of the nature of this extraordinary cri&s;is, pre|&s;ented an almo&s;t infinite variety. Perhaps, at this period, when from the long-pa&s;t extinction of all pa&s;&s;ions connected with the point of time, there is the better chance for temperate judgment; it may be concluded, that the fever of liberty and equality raged too hotly in the veins of the people to ad|mit the only mea&s;ure which, in the eye of wi&s;dom, could have been deemed expedient, or adequate to the exigencies of that preg|nant cri&s;is: it may be concluded, that the murder of the Monarch, with all its atten|dant circum&s;tances of horror, at a time when
<PB N="4" REF="037419_0005_100D3C9D9F80B668">Illumini&s;m, and the inva&s;ions of barbarians,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">So the Romans denominated <HI>all Foreigners.</HI></NOTE> had not &s;teeled our &s;inews to the emotions of humanity, perhaps alone enabled the Ad|mini&s;tration of that day to carry into effect, even the Proclamation of Neutrality. Car|ried into effect, indeed, it never was; but it was borne, it was &s;uffered to be promulged, with however great murmur, with however bitter execrations. Influenced by the&s;e con&s;iderations, which, it &s;eems probable, an impartial po&s;terity will recognize as unequi|vocal facts, this Act will ju&s;tly be regarded as one of the mo&s;t luminous points in the character of its great Author.</P>
<P>FROM the torpor which en&s;ued upon the turbulence and con&s;piracies of Genet, we were again goaded into momentary "&s;en&s;i|bility" by new turbulences and new con&s;pi|racies, which being overcome, like the for|mer, by our &s;ingularly good or ill fortune, were eventually &s;ucceeded by actual ho&s;ti|lities
<PB N="5" REF="037419_0006_100D3C9F33790850">and a declaration of war. A declara|tion of war again&s;t <HI>the Government,</HI> by the Mini&s;ter at our Court, and his Admini&s;tra|tion at home, and by the actual commence|ment of unequivocal ho&s;tilities upon <HI>the people,</HI> under the orders of the latter.</P>
<P>AFTER two years' ho&s;tilities, waged with remor&s;ele&s;s per&s;ecution and cruelty, after in|numerable flagellations of our defencele&s;s people, and numerous murders, after the lo&s;s of a thou&s;and valuable merchantmen, and the extinction of that <HI>Character,</HI> under the au&s;pices of which alone we could have acted with effect, and after the Government had kneeled again and gain, in the dirt, to lick the du&s;t at the feet of low-bred up|&s;tarts, the people ro&s;e, and demanded war. A new &s;y&s;tem was put in force, and how wonderful, and how glorious were its ef|fects, until our Evil Genius admini&s;tered a new potion of Mandragora, lulled the very &s;oul of the country to &s;leep, and &s;unk every energy into a &s;tate of inexorable &s;omno|lency.</P>

As we have &s;lept, and idly dreamed of peace, and repo&s;e and &s;ecurity, and Repub|lican millenariani&s;m, new perils have &s;prung up from the fertile hot-bed of faction; and watered by the genial dews of demagogy, and cheri&s;hed by the benignant &s;un of Phi|lo&s;ophi&s;m, have taken deep root, to bring forth fruit abundantly.</P>
<P>As we have &s;lept, we have been impa&s;|&s;ively borne along to the verge of a cri&s;is, on the turn of which hangs no le&s;s a point than the fate of the whole community: and we are arrived nearly to the deci&s;ion, with|out even a random effort to &s;tay the plague which impends.</P>
<P>As we have &s;lept, amid&s;t the delu&s;ions of commi&s;&s;ioners, a&s;&s;urances, negociations, and words and &s;ounds and &s;chemes, without meaning, and without other effect than to prolong our torpidity, the machinations of the &s;ervants of the enemy, have advanced to a violent probability of &s;ucce&s;s, in their long contemplated project of obtaining po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
<PB N="7" REF="037419_0008_100D3CA429FA46E0">of the Government of the country. A cata&s;trophe at even the po&s;&s;ibility of which, who is &s;o infatuated as not to tremble?</P>
<P>BUT the &s;ucce&s;s of Faction, in forcing down its Candidate upon the Public, is, as I promi&s;e my&s;elf herea&s;ter to make apparent, but an in&s;ignificant means to a va&s;t end.</P>
<P>THE univer&s;al end of Jacobini&s;m, is the the overthrow of whatever good exi&s;ts. With one con&s;ent, its di&s;ciples are, and have been, and ever will be, ready to exclaim,&mdash; Whatever is, is WRONG.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Pursuits of Literature.</NOTE> They are the footpads and the highwaymen of &s;ociety, with who&s;e exi&s;tence, law and order and &s;y&s;tem are altogether incompatible; the &s;corpions, and adders of mankind, who&s;e mortal ve|nom "holds &s;uch enmity with blood of man, that &s;wift as quick&s;ilver it cour&s;es through the natural gates and alleys of the body, and with a &s;udden vigour, it doth po&s;&s;et and
<PB N="8" REF="037419_0009_100D3CA66823FC58">curd, like eager droppings into milk, the thin and whole&s;ome blood." Such is the general character of Jacobini&s;m: Its &s;pe|cial attributes and tendencies, vary with times, localities, and temperaments. The Jacobini&s;m, or Anti-Foederali&s;m, or True Americani&s;m, or (according to the la&s;t di|&s;tinction which it has a&s;&s;umed) the <HI>Republi|cani&s;m</HI> of America, took its origin at the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the pre&s;ent Con&s;titution of the United States, impropoperly denomi|nated Foederal.</P>
<P>THE Anti-Foederali&s;ts (the undoubted Jacobins of that day and of this) declared the Government contemplated by their po|litical opponents, to be mon&s;trous<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Independent Gazetteer, and the other Anti-Foederal newspapers of that day, passim.</NOTE> and im|practicable, and advocated a form of &s;imple confederation in its &s;tead.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="037419_0010_100D3CA8B21D1618">
THIS faction mi&s;repre&s;ented in toto, the nature and form of the contemplated Insti|tution; &s;ince the Con&s;titution of the United States po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es no one feature of a Foede|ral Government. On the contrary, it was the mi&s;ery which the people had encounter|ed under their Foederal Government, which induced the abolition of that form and e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>THE Con&s;titution of the United States, in its <HI>original form,</HI> (I mean, as it was even|tually adopted) contains in no in&s;tance any acknowledgment of the <HI>&s;upremacy,</HI> of the lo|cal Governments. They are therein repeat|edly and expre&s;sly recognized as fiefs of the general &s;upremacy, and as &s;uch are by that in&s;trument holden to numerous feudal duties; but they are never recognized as paramount &s;overeignties, nor even as co-e&s;tates; So prepo&s;terous an idea never could ari&s;e in any other than the pre&s;ent ridiculous aera.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="037419_0011_100D3CAA4E85A6C0">
IN order to &s;hew, more clearly, that the prevailing conceptions concerning the na|ture of the American Government are erro|neous, it is nece&s;&s;ary to advert to the cau&s;es which gave birth to its e&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>IN the course of this examination, it will as I think, very clearly appear, that the men denominated Jacobins, are the real Foe|derali&s;ts of the pre&s;ent day; and that the Con&s;titutionali&s;ts, or friends to their coun|try, and its Government, as at fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h|ed, are unwittingly playing into the hands of their enemies, by contributing to the perpetration of a delu&s;ion, under colour of which the Faction are advancing into the &s;eats of power.</P>
<P>THE cabali&s;tic denomination of this &s;ect, as well as any &s;et of principles, by which they may affect at &s;ea&s;ons to be governed, ought not to obtain the &s;erious currency which they have at all times done. It is of no con&s;equence, under what ma&s;k an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in approaches us &s;o that we recognize him an
<PB N="11" REF="037419_0012_100D3CAD9A95D4F8">a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in: fair words, &s;mooth preten&s;ions, and hypocritical denominations, charm not the enmity of faction, and ought ne|ver to lull our apprehen&s;ions, or to di|vert our views from its invariable end. The Anti-Foederali&s;t of 1789, oppo&s;ed the Go|vernment becau&s;e he thought it conducive to the happine&s;s of the country, and the Ja|cobin or &s;oi-di&s;ant Republican of the pre|&s;ent day, acts preci&s;ely on the &s;ame princi|ples. In the eye of reflection, the charac|ters are completely identified.</P>
<P>THE condition of the country from the treaty of peace in 1783, to the year 1787, pre&s;ented &s;o melancholy a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of di&s;a&s;ters, of every kind, as to produce an uni|ver&s;al voice for a new Con&s;titution. Under the Foederal Government, the people &s;aw their trade declining almo&s;t to non-entity; they &s;aw all public confidence and all cre|dit between man and man at an end, and they one and all de&s;paired of any fa|vourable change under &s;o untoward a &s;y&s;|tem. They &s;aw their Confederation whol|ly
<PB N="12" REF="037419_0013_100D3CAFE2088E10">inadequate to the protection of its sub|jects, who were in great numbers
<Q><L>Taken by an insolent foe</L>
<L>And sold to slavery without redemption thence.</L></Q>
While the fire of revolt and rebellion had bur&s;t the cobweb barrier which re&s;trained it, and threatened to deva&s;tate the pro&s;trate land. With one con&s;ent, it was re&s;olved to aboli&s;h that &s;y&s;tem &s;o fertile in mi&s;eries, whatever other might be &s;ub&s;tituted.</P>
<P>IN fixing on a &s;ub&s;titute, it was very obvious that va&s;t difficulties were to be en|countered; by many they were feared even to be in&s;urmountable.</P>
<P>THERE were to be conciliated, the great|e&s;t variety of jarring pa&s;&s;ions, principles and intere&s;ts, that ever fell to the lot of men to encounter.</P>
<P>"IT was obviou&s;ly <HI>impracticable,</HI>" as the Convention who formed the Con&s;titution, ob&s;erve, "to &s;ecure all rights of <HI>Indepen|dant Sovereignty</HI> to <HI>each,</HI> and yet provide for
<PB N="13" REF="037419_0014_100D3CB309B42950">the intere&s;t and &s;afety of all." Therefore, "in all our deliberations," continue they, "we kept &s;teadily in our view, that which appears to us the <HI>greatest interest</HI> of every true American, the CONSOLIDATION of our Union, in which is involved our Pro&s;perity, Felicity, Safety, perhaps our National Ex|i&s;tence."</P>
<P>SUCH were the views which prevailed over the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Con&s;titution of the United States. It was e&s;&s;entially and entirely an act of CONSOLIDATION, taking place of the act of Foederation, which had died of inanition.</P>
<P>WHILE the&s;e, the only proper and legi|timate conceptions of the nature of that In|&s;trument, obtained, an uninterrupted tide of pro&s;perity di&s;tingui&s;hed the public fortunes. Nor was it till that fatal breach was made in this barrier round the public weal, by which the States were made paramount Sovereignties, that faction ever attained that daring height which is almo&s;t in&s;tantly a&s;&s;u|med.
<PB N="14" REF="037419_0015_100D3CB498055290">No longer was there wanting to the Jacobins a point of rallying, no longer had any one to exclaim with Archimedes, <GAP DESC="foreign"> their indi&s;pen&s;able pa&s;&s;ion for revolutionary movements, was confirmed on the mo&s;t important ba&s;is, by this e&s;tabli&s;hment of its practicability, and of the long de&s;ired <HI>means</HI> to their end.</P>
<P>WHILE there was but one Government in the country; while the States were re|garded but as &s;o many Lieutenancies, or &s;ub|ordinate divi&s;ions, &s;uffered to exi&s;t in their ancient form, in&s;tead of being con&s;tituted counties, only from deference to prejudice; while, in fact, there was but one rallying point, and of cour&s;e an unity of action, and an entirety of organization; the people revolted at the projects of revolutionizers when they dared, which indeed was then &s;eldom, to carry their views, openly, to that extent. But, no &s;ooner, was the foundation of the Con&s;titution subverted, and the Governments of the country mul|tiplied to &s;eventeen or eighteen, than Fac|tion
<PB N="15" REF="037419_0016_100D3CB6D2C06A40">immediately laid its axe at the root of the Con&s;titution of the United States, and employed all its efforts to bring about the &s;ub&s;titution of the State Governments in its &s;tead; in other words, to revive the old Confederation. This propo&s;ition is to be found in very di&s;tinct terms in the writings of &s;everal of the party, and particularly in a work publi&s;hed at the &s;outhward, called "The Pro&s;pect before us."</P>
<P>This end they hope and mean to obtain through the in&s;trumentality of the Candi|date whom they are &s;eeking to exalt to the Chief Magi&s;tracy. His opinions on the &s;ub|ject are before the world. The&s;e have e&s;|&s;entially varied at different times, according to the different currents of public &s;entiment, of which he hath ever been a mo&s;t ob&s;e|quious &s;lave. At fir&s;t, though he had thrown whatever influence he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed into the &s;cale of oppo&s;ition to the New Con&s;titution, he yet affected, in public, to be an admirer of that In&s;trument, to which he took no
<PB N="16" REF="037419_0017_100D3CB9C5DE3A50">other exception than at the omi&s;&s;ion to in|corporate with it, a bill of rights.</P>
<P>BUT when we receive his opinion of the Con&s;titution, through a medium exempt from this &s;ervile influence, we find it of a very different ca&s;t. When in the warmth of confidence, he writes of it what he thinks, we find him &s;tigmati&s;ing that form, as the form of the odious Con&s;titution of England. Its ties which he con&s;iders as Lilliputian "we" &s;ays he, "&s;hall break."</P>
<P>IT is become a que&s;tion, then, whether the Con&s;titution of the United States &s;hall &s;tand, or whether we will quietly behold it &s;ubverted, and the organized anarchy of Federali&s;m &s;ub&s;tituted. This is the &s;imple point of conte&s;t between the two parties. We have mo&s;t fooli&s;hly put it at i&s;&s;ue; and it is with God only to grant us "a good deliverance."</P>
<P>IF the preceding views be correct, it is obvious that the di&s;tinctive appellations of
<PB N="17" REF="037419_0018_100D3CBB6A4430C0">the parties in this country are improper and ab&s;urd. It is true that mankind in all ages have been little influenced by reflec|tion in this regard; having in many in&s;tances adopted cabali&s;tic di&s;tinctions from accident and often from the mo&s;t ludicrous whim. Yet I think it as well at lea&s;t to wear a cha|racteri&s;tic name as an unmeaning one, and better even an unmeaning one, than that which conveys a fal&s;e meaning.</P>
<P>THE Foederali&s;ts it is to be a&s;&s;umed, de|&s;ire that the Con&s;titution of the United States may exi&s;t in its original, integral &s;tate of &s;upremacy; that it may be in all ca&s;es, the Supreme Law of the Land, unaffected by the cla&s;hing of Local Intere&s;ts, and uncontroul|ed by the operations of &s;ubordinate pow|ers. They are <HI>Constitutionalists,</HI> Ameri|cans, loyal to their country and to one another.</P>
<P>THE Democrats de&s;ire that the Con&s;ti|tution of the United States &s;hould be "di&s;|annulled"&mdash;they
<PB N="18" REF="037419_0019_100D3CBE12B69E70">de&s;ire that condition of things, in which the total ab&s;ence of order, may give "pa&s;&s;age free" to the per&s;onal violences of their malignant pa&s;&s;ions, and to their thir&s;t for power and for gold. They would revive the Confederation, and are indi&s;putably Foederali&s;ts, without having Foe|derali&s;m or any other object really at heart, any further than as a means of aggrandi&s;e|ment, a &s;tep by which to a&s;cend the height of power.</P>
<P>WHAT is <HI>Foederali&s;m?</HI> This is an en|quiry peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary, notwith&s;tanding the term has been in &s;o common u&s;e for &s;o many years. It may be denominated <HI>The State of Nature applied to Governments;</HI> and this perhaps is the ground of preference with tho&s;e who call them&s;elves Republicans, as they are ever ready to exclaim, with the illegitimate villain of Shake&s;peare,</P>
<Q>Thou, Nature, art our Goddess! to thy law Our services are bound.</Q>
<P><PB N="19" REF="037419_0020_100D3CC1B966FDF8">
BUT their Godde&s;s of Nature is a New Deity and of the Modern Pantheon; and &s;he re&s;embles the image of a celebrated tyrant, in the remor&s;ele&s;s cruelties and per|&s;ecutions which &s;he has inflicted on man|kind, under the fair &s;emblance of mildne&s;s and philanthropy.</P>
<P><HI>Foederali&s;m,</HI> or the quality of attach|ment to a Foederal form of Government, is &s;urely the mo&s;t trivial di&s;tinctive title of a party that was ever yet a&s;&s;umed: a man may be a Foederali&s;t and Royali&s;t, a Foederali&s;t and Republican, or a Foederali&s;t and an enemy to either Royalty or Republi|cani&s;m. There is no incon&s;i&s;tency in the&s;e characters, as has been exemplified in fact and experience. The con&s;equence has been that the political adver&s;aries of the men &s;tyling them&s;elves Foederali&s;ts, have robbed them of their di&s;tinctive appellation, and they now act without any name, as they have long done without any fixed or defined principles either of morals or poli|ties: As the Cuckow creeps into the ne&s;t
<PB N="20" REF="037419_0021_100D3CC349AAB370">of a certain fooli&s;h bird, and ejects it and its offspring.</P>
<P>IN the di&s;tinctive appellations of parties in every age, we di&s;cern &s;ome meaning, &s;ome connection, more or le&s;s remote, be|tween the name and qualities of &s;ome cer|tain kind. This is obviou&s;ly nece&s;&s;ary, to prevent the dilemma alluded to above. It will be &s;aid that Foederali&s;m denotes attach|ment to the Foederal Government, mean|ing the government of this country, and that, reaching this end, it is &s;ufficiently defi|nite. The object to be defined, viz. at|tachment to the Government, is &s;urely &s;imple enough; but if, in attempting to define a definite object, a term &s;o indefi|nite is made u&s;e of, as to be liable not only to perver&s;ions but mi&s;con&s;tructions, the &s;implicity of the object it&s;elf is rendered of no avail; it might as well have been com|plex and ab&s;tru&s;e.</P>
<P>THE Con&s;titutionali&s;t denominates him|&s;elf a Foederali&s;t, and pronounces the attri|butes
<PB N="21" REF="037419_0022_100D3CC4D6D4D558">of Foederali&s;m to be the&s;e or tho&s;e. The Republican as loudly proclaims him&s;elf a Foederali&s;t al&s;o, but his picture of the at|tributes of Foederali&s;m is diametrically the rever&s;e of the other. So oppo&s;ite are the repre&s;entations and the views of the&s;e two Foederali&s;ts, that the latter would (in the words of Mr. John Adams) incontinently "fine, impri&s;on and hang his own brother" if a per&s;on of the former per&s;ua&s;ion. The truth is, that the former, if he be a man of either &s;en&s;e or hone&s;ty, is not a Foederali&s;t. No man can be a real friend to the Govern|ment of the United States, and a Foederal|i&s;t, in the &s;en&s;e in which the term is ap|plied.</P>
<P>TO decide with more preci&s;ion this que&s;tion, it is worth while to attempt to at|tain a right under&s;tanding of the force and meaning of the term <HI>Foederal,</HI> in its fulle&s;t extent. The unequivocal derivation of the term, goes far to decide every que&s;tion of its &s;ignification, and Foederation (a new root of the word, of American growth)

Now a league or covenant may take place, either between individuals or bodies politic. The account of the combat between the Horatii and Curiatii, begins "<HI>Foedere</HI> icto, trigemini arma capiunt," and Otway makes his hero declare him&s;elf the "<HI>covenanted</HI> foe of Ve|nice." By con&s;truction, however, and by long u&s;age, the application of the term Foederation has been re&s;tricted, and it may be &s;aid at pre&s;ent to apply only to leagues or covenants between States. And as we have never known the term to be applied to denote leagues or covenants between &s;epe|rate or independant States, it mu&s;t be further re&s;tricted to leagues or covenants or a&s;&s;ocia|tions of different States forming one Nation.</P>
<P>NOW a league, whether between &s;epa|rate Nations, or different States of the &s;ame Nation is a temporary arrangement for the purpo&s;e of meeting &s;ome great emergency. uch was the league of the Grecian States again&s;t Philip, &s;uch al&s;o was was the league
<PB N="23" REF="037419_0024_100D3CC9C2818E48">of the American States again&s;t Great Britain. As long as the league, commonly called the Old Confederation la&s;ted, the United States were a Federation. But their fed|erali&s;m merged in the Con&s;titution of the United States.</P>
<P>FOEDERALISM, therefore, is a league be|tween different States of the &s;ame Nation, (as England, Scotland and Ireland) for tem|porary purposes: it is the Interregnum of Governments not Monarchical: and it al|ways implies the ab&s;ence of &s;ettled Go|vernment.</P>
<P>I AM well aware that the&s;e uncontrover|tible truths will encounter vehement re&s;is|tance from various cla&s;&s;es of men. Tho&s;e, who, o&s;tentatious of their &s;uppo&s;ed politi|cal orthodoxy, carry their bawling Foede|rali&s;m not only into the market place, but actually to market, will with much zeal pro|te&s;t again&s;t the&s;e opinions, &s;o fatal to the craft by which they have their wealth. Nor will there be wanting the acrimonious taunts
<PB N="24" REF="037419_0025_100D3CCBF9F0BBB0">and jeers of tho&s;e inclement &s;pirits, who realizing the&s;e truths, dread from their pre|valence the defeat of their projects and the downfall of their power.</P>
<P>BUT truth will march onwards in her career, however intere&s;ted ignorance and malice may oppo&s;e. While it may be al|lowed us to &s;peak, we will with loud voice proclaim tho&s;e truths which we deem to be u&s;eful; nor will their tendency to conciliate the applau&s;e or provoke the ill-will of the malignant and venomous &s;ectaries of blind and brutal violence be at all enquired into.</P>
<P>WHILE, yet there is life, and while yet living, we have hope, it &s;hall be endeavour|ed by active exertions to prolong that life, by exciting that hope to energetic action. To the friends of Government, it &s;eems time to apply every effort that may tend to rou&s;e them, to a &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e dan|gers which &s;urround them, of tho&s;e con&s;pi|racies which are unremittingly urged again&s;t their peace.</P>

<P>EVEN from the imperfect and indi&s;tinct accounts which have been tran&s;mitted us of the fortunes of the ancient Confederacies, we may gather a &s;ummary of wretchedne&s;s more voluminous than the annals of unmix|ed Governments through long ages.

<P>THE Confederacies of modern times, ex|hibit a picture &s;till more deplorable than tho&s;e of the ancients, becau&s;e our opportu|nities

<P>So abhorrent is equality to every impul&s;e of human nature, that men are not only found re&s;tive under the application of this principle to them as individuals, but &s;till more &s;o in their political relations. Provi|dence hath wi&s;ely ordained a chain of grades and &s;ubordinacies, from the pea&s;ant to the peer, from the monarch to the collected maje&s;ty of all monarchs.

The leaves periodically wither&mdash;but the trunk and its branches &s;urvive in unimpaired vigour and glory: the hand of violence may prune it of its branches&mdash;the dependant leaves then peri&s;h by the &s;troke; yet the Tree is &s;till a Tree: but the blow which levels the trunk annihilates the whole together.</P>
