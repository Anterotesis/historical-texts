<HEAD>To the Free and Independant Citi|zens of the United States of North-America.</HEAD>
<P>THE happy period being arrived, in which we may in peace, take a review of the &s;cenes, through which we have pa&s;&s;ed, and with calmne&s;s and impartiality exam|ine and judge of pa&s;t tran&s;actions, encourages me to come forward, and to addre&s;s you, on a &s;ubject of infinite im|portance to my&s;elf, and of &s;o much to you, as to excu&s;e me, from the making any previous-apology, on the occa|&s;ion.&mdash;Perhaps I ought rather to make one, for my hav|ing been &s;o long &s;ilent, under the many heavy charges, brought again&s;t me, in the public papers, in America.&mdash; Neither a want of &s;ufficient proofs, to refute them, or any indifference, as to the opinion of my countrymen, occa|&s;ioned my &s;ilence, but the reflection, that during the rage, and violence of war, and while party prejudices, heats and jealou&s;ies, were in their full force, it was by no means the time for a cool, and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, of any &s;ubject, on which, appearances had already prejudiced the minds of the public.</P>
<P>I re&s;olved to improve the fir&s;t moment, of public peace, and tranquility, to appear, and to plead my cau&s;e, at your bar; during near three years of misfortunes, and exile, I have impatiently looked for it; I now flatter my&s;elf, that it is arrived, and in that confidence, venture to call your attention to my ca&s;e.</P>
<P>It is of &s;ome importance, to you, to know, if one, who formerly had your confidence, to a great degree, actually betrayed, and de&s;erted you, and was guilty of the frauds, peculation, and treachery, with which he has been charged, or if artful, and de&s;igning men, inimical to him, have tak|en the advantage of his weakne&s;s, or imprudence, to charge him with tho&s;e enormous crimes; to excite a general clamour again&s;t him, and from his &s;ilence, to infer in the &s;tronge&s;t manner, his guilt.&mdash;Though I may &s;olicit your examination, of the &s;ubject, at this time, under very great di&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dventages, yet I am by no means thereby deterred, from
<PB N="4" REF="018438_0003_0FA76A155967F7A0">doing it; as yet, you have heard but one &s;ide of the que&s;|tion, and that at a time, when your &s;ituation, made you ju&s;tly apprehen&s;ive, and jealous of danger, from every quarter, and rendered you, as it were, feelingly alive in every pore; at pre&s;ent, when we are happily freed, from the alarms, and dangers of war, you will not refu&s;e, to hear the other part, and thereby become capable, of judging on the whole, with certainty, and with ju&s;tice, to the accu&s;ers, as well as to the accu&s;ed; which is all I a&s;k, or wi&s;h for&mdash;unwilling to take up more of your time, than is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, I &s;hall not in this addre&s;s, recapitu|late the many &s;urmi&s;es, and in&s;inuations, thrown out again&s;t me, by my enemies, in the cour&s;e of their per&s;ecutions of me, but confine my&s;elf, to the direct charges again&s;t me, which are all of them, comprehended under two heads:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, that I was guilty of fraud, and peculation, in the management, of the public monies, committed to my care; and &s;econdly, that after my return to France, in 1781, I wrote tho&s;e letters, which were intercepted, and publi&s;hed in New-York, from intere&s;ted motives, and with the ba&s;e and treacherous de&s;ign, to injure my country; having en|gaged my&s;elf in the intere&s;t of her enemies.</P>
<P>If on an impartial examination of facts, you &s;hall judge me guilty, of the&s;e crimes, nothing that has hitherto been &s;aid, or done again&s;t me, will be deemed unju&s;t, or too &s;e|vere; but if on the other hand, you &s;hall, from the mo&s;t unque&s;tionable facts, and circum&s;tances, find tho&s;e charges, to be fal&s;e, and groundle&s;s, whatever weakne&s;s, or impru|dence, you may find me ju&s;tly chargeable with, you will at lea&s;t, acquit me of any thing criminal, and pronounce me to be <HI>"A man more &s;inned again&s;t, than &s;ining."</HI></P>
<P>My conduct in the early part, of the late conte&s;t, and until my leaving America, in April 1776, to go for France, in the character of Commercial, and Political Agent, and Commi&s;&s;ioner for the United States, is too well known, to require my referring to any part of it.&mdash;The charges again&s;t me, originate after that period; previous to it, I had no charge of public monies. I arrived in France, in June 1776, and acted as &s;ole Commercial, and Political Agent, for the United States until the month of December following, when I received a commi&s;&s;ion, from Congre&s;s, appointing Doctor Franklin, Mr. Lee, and my&s;elf, their joint Com|mi&s;&s;ioners
<PB N="5" REF="018438_0004_0FA76A16285CEA90">Plenipotentiary, and I continued to act, in this character, until the fir&s;t of April 1778, when in obedience to the orders of Congre&s;s, I left Paris, on my return to America, and from that period, to the pre&s;ent hour, have not been entru&s;ted with the monies of the public, or with any public employ whatever; it therefore follows, that if frauds, peculation, and embezzlements, were practi&s;ed, and committed by me, they mu&s;t have been in, and during that period, that is between April 1776, and April 1778, &mdash;and that I mu&s;t have committed them, in my tran&s;ac|tions at Paris, where I con&s;tantly re&s;ided; the time and place being a&s;certained, the ju&s;tice or inju&s;tice of this charge, will at once be &s;een, by an examination, of my re|ceipts, and di&s;bur&s;ements of public monies.&mdash;On the 4th of March 1778, I received a po&s;itive order, from Congre&s;s, to return immediately to America, to acquaint them, with the &s;tate of their affairs, in Europe; in the re&s;olution of Congre&s;s tran&s;mitted and in the letter accompanying of it, to me, this appeared to be, the only motive, and object of my recall.&mdash;Though the treaties with France, had been concluded, and &s;igned on the &s;ixth of February preceding, yet they had &s;till been kept &s;ecret, and by agreement with the Court of France, were not to be made public, in Eu|rope, until intelligence &s;hould be received, of their being arrived, and publi&s;hed, in America; But &s;everal circum|&s;tances, concur'd at that time, to induce the Court of France, to change their plan, and publicly to announce, to the Court of London, their having entered into Trea|ties of Commerce, and Alliance, with the United States, and to di&s;patch, with all po&s;&s;ible &s;ecrecy, and expedition, the fleet then at Toulon, to America, under the command of the Count D'E&s;taing; and the Count D'Vergennes, and Dr. Franklin, joined, in advi&s;ing me, to keep my re|call, and my intention to return, &s;ecret, until the fleet &s;hould &s;ail, in which it was propo&s;ed, that I &s;hould em|bark.</P>
<P>At this time, mo&s;t of the contracts, for &s;tores, arms, cloathing, &amp;c. and for &s;hips to tran&s;port them to Ameri|ca, were compleated; the execution of tho&s;e contracts, had been principally under my direction, but though monies had been advanced, on all of them, the accompts of the contractors, had not been brought in for &s;ettlement,
<PB N="6" REF="018438_0005_0FA76A184E84A8D8">and it was impo&s;&s;ible for me, if I literally complied with the order of Congre&s;s, and with the urgent reque&s;t, of the French Mini&s;ter, and of Doctor Franklin, to go out in the fleet; to do any thing previou&s;ly, towards the calling in, and &s;ettling the public, or even my private accompts; any attempt that way, would have defeated the &s;ecrecy, and di&s;patch enjoined me&mdash;though nothing appeared in the order of Congre&s;s, or in any of their letters, which intimated, the lea&s;t di&s;&s;atisfaction, with my conduct, or any &s;u&s;picion of the faithful management, and applica|tion, of the public monies, yet as I had from the fir&s;t, the misfortune, to have in Mr. Lee, one of my Colleagues, a mo&s;t jealous, and artful enemy, and &s;en&s;ible, that many ill offices, had been done me in America, I was extreme|ly de&s;irous, to put off my return until all the tran&s;actions in which I had had, any concern for the public, &s;hould be &s;ettled, and clo&s;ed, but finally, I &s;ubmitted to the advice of Count D'Vergennes, and of Dr. Franklin, and con|tented my&s;elf, with taking from Mr. Grand, the Banker for Congre&s;s, an accompt of all the monies, received, or paid out, on accompt of Congre&s;s, up to that time, this was all that was in my power to do, and as Mr. Grand, had mentioned in his accompt, the names of the per&s;ons, to whom he had paid money, and as I carried out with me, the mo&s;t honourable te&s;timonials, from his Maje&s;ty, from his Mini&s;ter, and from my colleague, and intimate friend Dr. Franklin, of my zeal, and integrity in the &s;er|vice of my country, I had no rea&s;on to apprehend, the be|ing cen&s;ured, for not having &s;ettled, and brought out with me, all the public accompts, and their vouchers, in detail; but on my arrival in Philadelphia, I &s;oon &s;ound, that my enemies, had been, to a certain degree, &s;ucce&s;sful, in poi|&s;oning the minds of the public by in&s;inuating, that I had become immen&s;ely rich, in the &s;ervice of the public, and con&s;equently that I mu&s;t have been guilty of undue, and dishone&s;t practices; and though I had been &s;ent for ex|pre&s;sly, to inform Congre&s;s, of the &s;tate of their affairs, in Europe, and notwith&s;tanding the honourable character, I had &s;u&s;tained, as their Political, and Commercial Agent in Europe, and afterwards as one of their Commi&s;&s;ioners Plenipotentiary, I could not obtain an audience, of that body, until after &s;ix weeks attendance, and &s;olicitation.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="018438_0006_0FA76A19310BE0B0">
I then gave them verbally, a faithful detail, of the &s;tate of their affairs, in Europe, and laid before them, Mr. Grands accompt of the receipts, and payments of monies, to the time of my leaving Paris; and reque&s;ted, that if their had been, any charge or in&s;inuation again&s;t me, for mi&s;management, or neglect, that I might be informed of it, and be permitted to be heard, in my defence.</P>
<P>I was not told of any, and though Congre&s;s appeared no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> way di&s;&s;atisfied, with the account, I then gave them, of the &s;tate of their affairs, in Europe, and of my own con|duct, in their &s;ervice, and though the &s;ettlement of the public, as well as of my private accompts, pre&s;&s;ed me to return as early as po&s;&s;ible, to France, yet I could not ob|tain any re&s;olution, of Congre&s;s, either to approve, or to di&s;approve, of any part of my conduct, and though I al|mo&s;t daily &s;olicited, for a &s;econd audience, I did not ob|tain one, until late in December following.</P>
<P>I then gave them a written narrative of my tran&s;actions, from my leaving America in their &s;ervice, until my recall and return,&mdash;Congre&s;s then appeared di&s;po&s;ed, to take the matter up, and to examine it, and to come to &s;ome determination, on the &s;ubject, a Committee was appointed to examine the &s;tate of their foreign affairs, and into the conduct of their Commi&s;&s;ioners, and Agents, and for greater di&s;patch, the Committee were ordered, to meet every evening, Saturday and Sunday evenings excepted; yet that Committee never conde&s;cended to admit me to an audience, or to a&s;k me a &s;ingle que&s;tion, on the &s;ub|ject of their enquiry.&mdash;And though I had been &s;ent for expre&s;sly, to inform Congre&s;s, of the &s;tate of their affairs in Europe, yet their Committee, &s;tudiou&s;ly evaded, the giving me an opportunity of laying before them, any in|formation on the &s;ubject, or of explaining any part of my own conduct, while in their &s;ervice.</P>
<P>During more than fourteen months attendance in Phila|delphia, I obtained but two audiences from Congre&s;s, and none from their Committee, who&s;e proceeding, and report, if indeed they made any, were kept &s;ecret from me,&mdash;In December 1778, having waited five months in Philadel|phia, almo&s;t daily &s;oliciting Congre&s;s to examine my tran&s;actions, while in their &s;ervice, I found that a party determined, on my ruin, had &s;ufficient intere&s;t, to prevent
<PB N="8" REF="018438_0007_0FA76A52C645B680">all examination, and to bear me down, by the mo&s;t mor|tifying delay, and neglect; I therefore re&s;olved to lay my ca&s;e, before 'my countrymen, and fellow-citizens, but on my fir&s;t addre&s;s to them, Congre&s;s re&s;olved to give me an audience, and afterward appointed a Committee, as I have before mentioned.</P>
<P>As I flattered my&s;elf, that Congre&s;s had re&s;olved, to examine, into the &s;tate of foreign affairs, and of tho&s;e tran&s;actions, in which I had been a principal actor, and to come to &s;ome determination, on the &s;ubject, I could not con&s;ider my&s;elf at liberty, to proceed in publi&s;hing the &s;tate of my ca&s;e; in the mean time I was attacked and a|bu&s;ed, in the mo&s;t ba&s;e and outrageous manner, in the public papers,&mdash;I made no reply to the many calumnies, and fal&s;ehoods, publi&s;hed by a noted &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ribler, his a&s;&s;ociates and patrons, but earne&s;tly reque&s;ted, of Congre&s;s, and of their Committee, to grant me a hearing, and to do me ju&s;tice;&mdash;but my &s;olicitations were ineffectual, though from December 1778, to Augu&s;t 1779, I wrote more than thirty letters to Congre&s;s, humbly petitioning for a public examination, and tryal, yet they never conde&s;cended, to take the lea&s;t notice of my reque&s;ts:&mdash;In private conver|&s;ation with the members I was told, that the only difficul|ty lay in my accompts, not being &s;ettled; to obviate this, I returned to France, on a&s;&s;urances from Congre&s;s, that they had appointed, and impowered a gentleman in France, to audit, and &s;ettle all their public accompts; but on my arri|val in France, in July 1780, and application to him, I found that his power, was &s;o limited, that be declined, acting under it.&mdash;I wrote immediately to Congre&s;s, &s;olicit|ing for more ample powers to him, or to &s;ome other per|&s;on, and &s;et my&s;elf to put, not only my accompts, but tho&s;e of my colleagues, and of every one, with whom I had tran&s;acted any bu&s;ine&s;s, on account of the public, in a &s;tate for being audited, and &s;ettled; and I pa&s;&s;ed more than twelve months, at Paris, at a heavy expence, flatter|ing my&s;elf, that as Congre&s;s had made no objection, what|ever, to any part of my conduct, in their &s;ervice, except my not having &s;ettled my accompts, and as my enemies, both in Congre&s;s, and out of it, profe&s;&s;ed to believe, that I was a defaulter, they would not, after the prodigious ex|pence, of time, and money, which I had been put to, de|lay
<PB N="9" REF="018438_0008_0FA76A538C902BD8">the appointment of an auditor, to examine my ac|compts, and to a&s;certain the only point in que&s;tion, with regard to me; but I heard nothing on the &s;ubject, until November 1781, when I received a re&s;olve of Congre&s;s, informing me, that by the appointment of a Con&s;ul, pro|vi&s;ion was made, for the &s;ettlement of my accompts; but in a few days after, I met with Mr. Barclay the Con&s;ul, who to my extreme &s;urpri&s;e, and di&s;appointment, a&s;&s;ured me that he h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> no in&s;tructions on the &s;ubject; and a few days after, I had the mortification, of learning, that my letters of May, and June preceding, had beed intercepted, and publi&s;hed in New-York, and that the mo&s;t unfavour|able con&s;truction, had been put on them, both in America, and in France.</P>
<P>This placed me in a &s;ituation, in which I believe, but few men, have ever been &s;o unfortunate, as to fall into.</P>
<P>Pro&s;cribed in my own country, and in France, and ob|noxions to the government of this country, I &s;ubmitted to a tedious exile, in Flanders, where I remained, until the treaty of peace, was concluded, but in the mean time, I tran&s;mitted my accompts to Congre&s;s, and &s;olicited a &s;et|tlement, and the payment of the ballance due to me; I al&s;o &s;ent duplicates of them to Dr. Franklin, and to Mr. Barclay.</P>
<P>It is now more than eighteen months, &s;ince Congre&s;s have been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my accompts, it is more than five years, &s;ince I had either the money, or any employ|ment for the public entru&s;ted to my management.</P>
<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible that any fraud or embezzlement commit|ted by me, &s;hould &s;till remain undetected? Had I been guilty of any, would not my enemies with all the parti|culars of my accounts in their power, have pointed them out, and publi&s;hed them in&s;tead of charging me general|ly with being a defaulter for unaccounted millions?&mdash;In March 1778, Doctor Frankling a&s;&s;ured Congre&s;s that he had been an eye witne&s;s of my conduct in France, while his colleague, and that I had acted the part of an able, ac|tive, and fathful mini&s;ter, and to his knowledge had in various ways rendered great and important &s;ervices to my county

<P>Having on my arrival in France depo&s;ited in the hands of Mr. Delap, the whole of the effects brought out with me, and having never received any monies on account of Congre&s;s, from my engaging in their &s;ervice to the pre|&s;ent time, but from the per&s;ons above mentioned; it is ea&s;y to a&s;certain if I received more than the above &s;um on my private account, or for my immediate di&s;bur&s;ements for the public. I know of no que&s;tion that can ari&s;e on this &s;ubject, except it be on account of the overcharge made again&s;t me by Mr. Soulier, which I have explained in my account, and letters before Congre&s;s, and referred to Mr. R. Morris to ju&s;tify my explanation.</P>
<P>Though the funds which I put into Mr. Delap's hands in June 1776, amounted to livres, 73870,14,11. and he received &s;ome remittances from Me&s;&s;rs. Living&s;ton, Lew|is, Al&s;op, and Morris, over what he paid out on their ac|count; yet his di&s;bur&s;ements on account of Congre&s;s, and the &s;ums which I drew on him for on the &s;ame ac|count: So far exceeded the whole, that in December he refu&s;ed my bills, and on the 31&s;t wrote me as follows: <Q>Time only permits us to inform you, that we have re|ceived a letter from A. Ne&s;bitt, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of London, re|turning us prote&s;ted, 1200<ABBR>l.</ABBR> &s;terling; David White's bill of 20th of April, at 30 days &s;ight on Serjeant Cham|bers and Co. 1000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> &s;terling; of Margaret Living&s;ton's of 28th May, at 30 days &s;ight, on S.

Living&s;ton, Lewis and Al&s;op, and by Me&s;&s;rs. Willing and Morris,

Shinger's bill of the 20th of Augu&s;t, at 30 days &s;ight on Ford, Courtoys and Co. of Barcelona, which is likewi&s;e returned to us prote&s;ted. We are &s;orry for all the&s;e di&s;appointments; but in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of affairs, we look on bills as no remittance, for &s;carce one in ten of them is paid. The bills you forwarded us for acceptance mu&s;t be returned, or lie by until funds arrive, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>I will not take up the time of the public, by attempting to de&s;cribe the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation in which I found my|&s;elf at that period,&mdash;The whole of my &s;canty funds ex|pended, and indebt to near ten thou&s;and pounds &s;terling on account of Congre&s;s, for which I had given bills in my private name, and which were refu&s;ed by the Hou&s;e on which I was directed to value my&s;elf, and through whom remittances were to be made to me, nor the advantages at that time taken of our embarra&s;&s;ments to force us into a contract with the Farmers General for a quantity of to|bacco, to be delivered to them in France at little more than the one half of its then current price.</P>
<P>It is well known, that the Commi&s;&s;ioners obtained one million of livres to be advanced them by the Farmers Ge|neral on the&s;e hard terms, and about the &s;ame time two millions from the Court, to be paid quarterly in the cour&s;e of the year 1777. At &s;ome future time, I &s;hall en|ter mutually on the hi&s;tory of our &s;ituation at that peri|od, and of the whole of the negociation in France from my arrival in 1776 to the &s;igning of the treaties of Paris in 1778, and to my recall. At pre&s;ent it is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that the money then received and promi&s;ed, gave me as well as my colleagues a temporary relief&mdash;that the whole of it was paid into the hands of Mr. Grand, who&s;e account now more than five years &s;ince laid before Con|gre&s;s, will &s;hew to whom and to who&s;e orders he repaid it. But if I received of him, as appears from his account, the above &s;um of livres 69253 7 6, and of the others in the whole, with that &s;um, livres 148045 16 5, only &s;omewhat le&s;s than &s;even thou&s;and pounds; what mu&s;t or can be &s;aid of tho&s;e, who for four years &s;ince have been
<PB N="15" REF="018438_0014_0FA76A5A10410E78">charging me in all your public papers, with being a de|faulter for unaccounted millions? They could not have been ignorant of the &s;tate of the public account &s;o far as I was intere&s;ted in them, they were on the files of Con|gre&s;s in America, and in the bands of Doctor Franklin in France, open for the in&s;pection of every one, who&s;e in|tere&s;t or curio&s;ity might-excite them to an examination. But what were my di&s;bur&s;ements during this term of more than two years on account of the public, and for my time and expences? My account before Congre&s;s &s;hew that they amounted to a much larger &s;um than that which I had received, including my time and expences to Ame|rica, and during my attendance on Congre&s;s, and for my return to France, they amounted to livres 258,164 9 2, or, livres 110,118 12 9 more than I had received, leav|ing me a creditor for that &s;um, equal to &pound; .4817 18 7&frac12; &s;terling. Mr. Arthur Lee in a letter to Congre&s;s of the 1&s;t of June 1778, &s;ays, <Q><HI>I find that the expence of living in character, cannot well be le&s;s than three thou&s;and pounds &s;terling a year;</HI></Q> and adds, <Q><HI>if left to them&s;elves, I con|ceive that mo&s;t per&s;ons will e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ceed that &s;um,</HI></Q> that is, livres 68571 per annum. I was as Mr. Lee expre&s;&s;es it, left to my&s;elf; yet from my leaving America in 1776, until my leaving Paris to return to it in 1778, I have not charged but about eighty thou&s;and livres for all my ex|pences of every kind; the remainder of the liv. 258,164 9 2 was for di&s;bur&s;ements on account of Congre&s;s, and for my time and &s;ub&s;equent expences, the particulars of which are in my account before Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. William Lee made one journey to Vienna on ac|count of the public, and Mr. Izard who was at Paris for the education of his children, received while there a com|mi&s;&s;ion from Congre&s;s to the Court of Tu&s;cany, but ne|ver went out of Paris, or quitted his family on the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the public. The former of the&s;e gentlemen re|ceived &s;eventy-two thou&s;and livres, and the latter &s;ixty thou&s;and for their private expences; yet the&s;e men are among the loude&s;t again&s;t me for an extravagant wa&s;te of public money.</P>
<P>And permit me here my countrymen and fellow citi|zens, to reque&s;t of you, that you will examine for your|&s;elves, or that if your di&s;tance from Philadelphia will not
<PB N="16" REF="018438_0015_0FA76A5B50CC6270">permit you to do it, that you will demand of your Dele|ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s in Congre&s;s, an account of all the monies ever re|mitted to me by Congre&s;s, and of all that ever I received on their account,&mdash;by this you will be able to form a judg|ment with &s;ufficient preci&s;ion, if I am a defaulter for mil|lions or one of the public creditors. But exclu&s;ive of the above ballance due to me, after accounting for all the mo|nies received by me, I am entitled to a commi&s;&s;ion of five per cent on goods and military &s;tores purcha&s;ed by me, agreeable to orders received from Congre&s;s to the amount of livres 4756,393 17, which makes the &s;um of &pound; .238,445 0 7, including expence of po&s;tage. The&s;e goods and military &s;tores I purcha&s;ed previous to the arrival of my colleagues, in con&s;equence of the orders given me by the &s;ecret Committee of Congre&s;s, and on which I was promi&s;ed the &s;ame commi&s;&s;ion as was then given to other agents and purcha&s;ers, which was uniformly five per cent; for the purcha&s;es made jointly with my colleagues, I have not charged any thing, being then in a different capacity, as joint Commi&s;&s;ioner Plenipotentiary with them. Thus it appears that in&s;tead of being a defaulter, I am a credi|tor of the public's, and to a large amount; and of all the public creditors, perhaps no one has &s;uffered &s;o much in point of intere&s;t, certainly no one &s;o much in point of character.</P>
<P>But of this, I &s;hall take notice on a future occa&s;ion. I need not take up any more of your time at pre&s;ent on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ubject of my accounts, they have long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nce been before Congre&s;s, and to them I appeal to ju&s;tify the general &s;tate which I have given of my money tran&s;actions for the pub|lic. I have &s;hewn, and it will appear from them, that from my arrival in France in June 1776, to the Decem|ber following, when joined by Dr. Franklin and Mr. Lee, I had had no money or next to none of the public's at any time in my hands; but on the contrary, was at that time in advance for my employers, and that afterwards until my return to America, I did not receive a &s;um any way equal to my expences and di&s;bur&s;ements; and from that period to the pre&s;ent I have not had any public employ, or public money committed to my management. The &s;e|cond charge again&s;t me, is, on account of my having in May and June 1781, wrote my opinion of our public af|fairs
<PB N="17" REF="018438_0016_0FA76A5BC98E59A0">to my friends in America, and advi&s;ed peace and an accommodation with Great-Britain. I confe&s;s that the letters publi&s;hed by Rivington in New-York, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> mine, do not materially differ from tho&s;e which I actually wrote at that time, and which unfortunately for me were inter|cepted by the enemy, and that they contain the undi&s;|gui&s;ed &s;entiments of my heart at that time, on the then apparent &s;ituation of our affairs; but I never yet heard of its being deemed a crime in a free &s;tate, for its citizens to give their opinion and advice on public affairs and mea&s;ures. To &s;uppo&s;e me to have been in the intere&s;t of the Mini&s;ters of this country, and to have wrote tho&s;e letters to promote their views, is as ab&s;urd as to &s;uppo&s;e, that I ama&s;&s;ed an immen&s;e fortune in the &s;ervice of my country; yet although my well known circum&s;tances and connections at that period, and previous to it, as well as &s;ince, demon&s;trate the ab&s;urdity and fal&s;hood of &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition; yet both the one and the other have been not only &s;uppo&s;ed, but po&s;itively a&s;&s;erted by certain wri|ters in America, who &s;tick at nothing however extrava|gant.</P>
<P>I can hardly imagine, notwith&s;tanding the late and pre|&s;ent pro&s;perous &s;tate of our affairs, that any one can have forgot the &s;ituation in which they were in 1781, when I wrote tho&s;e letters, and previous to the &s;urrender of Lord Cornwallis and his army at York. In May and in June 1781, the Briti&s;h forces were in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole of our &s;ea coa&s;t, from the Chee&s;apeak &s;outhward, and while they ravaged and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed the inter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or country, their &s;hips of war and crui&s;ers intercepted almo&s;t the whole of our trade and of our &s;upplies; we had no naval force to oppo&s;e to theirs, nor any probability at that time of our ally &s;ending to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance, a naval force &s;uperior to that of the enemy. The army under General Wa&s;h|ington was too weak of it&s;elf for any offen&s;ive opera|tions, and Congre&s;s had neither money or credit &s;ufficient to put it on a more re&s;pectable footing. General Wa&s;hing|ton did no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;cruple at that period to declare, <Q>That with|out a decidedly &s;uperior fleet to that of Great-Britain in America, all oppo&s;ition to the Briti&s;h force in Ame|rica would &s;oon be at an end.</Q> All the letters from America were in the &s;ame &s;tile; many circum&s;tances, as the time, my own ob&s;ervations and the information I was th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="18" REF="018438_0017_0FA76A5D6840BFA0">in the way of, led me to conclude, that there was not the lea&s;t probability of there being a French fleet on our coa&s;t that campaign &s;uperior to the Briti&s;h. Accidents and circum&s;tances unfore&s;een at that time, and tho&s;e extreme|ly improbable ones, joined to a neglect or breach of or|ders on the part of the Briti&s;h, gave the French &s;leet that &s;uperiority, which alone decided the fate of Lord Corn|wallis and of his army at York; had not this event hap|pened, of which when I wrote there was not the mo&s;t di&s;tant probability, the war mu&s;t have terminated again&s;t us in that campaign. In this I was &s;upported by the una|nimous opinion of the be&s;t judges on the &s;ubject then in America,&mdash;was it a crime in me to write from Europe to America, in the &s;ame &s;tile in which our Generals and leading men wrote to their friends in Europe? My let|ters have been publi&s;hed, their's have not; this is the &s;ole difference, except the cruel circum&s;tance of mine having been publi&s;hed by the enemy, at a time when our danger was over, and when the publication could &s;erve no other pur|po&s;e, but to ruin me in the opinion of my countrymen. At the time of my writing, every thing con&s;pired to con|vince me, that France had only her own intere&s;t and that of Spain in view, in the war, and that however, it might terminate, &s;he would be very far from con&s;ulting our in|tere&s;t, in the peace, per&s;uaded of this, I wrote it, to be my opinion, and for this I have been deemed an enemy, and traitor to France, as well as to the United States.</P>
<P>But have not events in part ju&s;tified this opinion of mine?

If from my arrival in France in 1780, to the &s;igning of the preliminary articles, I had any other corre&s;pondence in this country, let it be made to appear, I boldly challenge my accu&s;ers to pro|duce the lea&s;t proof of any; full two months &s;ince, it was publi&s;hed in the news-papers of this city, that I had been at Court, and was pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty, had an audi|ence of the Duke of Portland, dined with Mr. Fox, &amp;c. &amp;c. while to this hour I have not even &s;een his Maje&s;ty, or any one of the royal family, except the Prince of Wales at a di&s;tance and on hor&s;eback, nor have I any greater knowledge of any of the other great per&s;onages, with whom it has been a&s;&s;irmed that I am on &s;uch terms of intimacy. If it were not &s;o, I could have no intere&s;t, no motive to deny or to conceal it.</P>
<P>But the truth is, that the &s;tile of life which my circum|&s;tances have obliged me to take up, has prevented my forming a numerous acquaintance, either at court or in the city, the former I have never &s;o much as entered, and mo&s;t probable never &s;hall. Soon after my arrival in Lon|don, Gen. Arnold called twice on me at my lodgings, and was &s;hewn into my chamber without being announ|ced, be appeared not to reflect in how different a &s;ituation he now was, from that in which he formerly &s;tood, when we were in the habits of the mo&s;t intimate friend&s;hip; I therefore very freely put him in mind of it, and he di&s;|continued his vi&s;its, and I have not &s;een or &s;poke to him for more than five months pa&s;t.</P>
<P>I my letters of the 10th of June 1781, to Mr. R. Mor|ris, publi&s;hed in New-York by Rivington, I gave my opi|nion what the &s;tate of our commerce would be on a peace, and on the confirmation of our independant &s;overeignty, and I gave at large the rea&s;ons on which I had formerd that opinion, by an unfortunate accident; the contents of that letter have been made public, and to them I refer; hitherto I have &s;een nothing to contradict the &s;entiments I then entertained on this &s;ubject, but many things to confirm me in them, though I mo&s;t &s;incerely wi&s;h that
<PB N="29" REF="018438_0028_0FA76A6733DB0640">experience, the infallible te&s;t of truth in &s;uch &s;ubjects, may finally prove them erroneous, and my arguments and conclu&s;ions to have been ill founded.&mdash;But neither for &s;ometime before, or &s;ince my being in this country, has it been in my power, had I been di&s;po&s;ed, to do any thing to the prejudice of our commerce, and I can with great &s;incerity declare, that intere&s;t, as well as a di&s;po&s;ition in|dependant of intere&s;ted motives, will ever lead me to im|prove every opportunity, to do what little may be in my power, to promote the commerce of my country, on the &s;ucce&s;s of which, its future happine&s;s and pro&s;perity, &s;o greatly depend.</P>
<P>If pre&s;ent or future events ju&s;tify my apprehen&s;ions in my letter to Mr. Morris, am I to blame? Tho&s;e events do not, and cannot depend on me;&mdash;what grounds have we to expect more from Great-Britain, than what other aliens and foreigners are entitled to? Or than what we are indulged with, by other nations, in their We&s;t-India po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions?</P>
<P>All the Spani&s;h and Portugueze American ports, are &s;hut again&s;t us, and again&s;t all the world, the Dutch ports of St. Eu&s;tatius and Curacoa, which i&s;lands produce noth|ing, are open without re&s;erve to us, but Surinam and Dema|rara, productive colonies, have never been but partially open, nothing which could be &s;ent to them from Europe, to any advantage, was allowed to be received from us, nor any thing which Holland had a demand for in Europe, to be taken by us, it has ever been much the &s;ame, in the French i&s;lands, and we are not by the treaty, entitled to any thing more in future; the protection and government of the We&s;t-India po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, co&s;t the European powers large &s;ums, will they be at this expence, and give other na|tions, the trade of them?</P>
<P>This nation was the fir&s;t in Europe which &s;aw its own intere&s;t, with re&s;pect to commerce, in a true light, and by the navagation act, came to a re&s;olution, to re&s;erve the mo&s;t certain all the profits of trade, that of the carrying bu&s;ine&s;s, to its own &s;ubjects.&mdash;That act was the corner &s;tone, on which the Briti&s;h commerce and matine ro&s;e, and on which it &s;till re&s;ts.&mdash;Can it be expected, that this government &s;hould at this time repeal, or violate that act? Or that it &s;hould be di&s;pen&s;ed with, in our favour? They
<PB N="30" REF="018438_0029_0FA76A70B45B4A30">who expect this, look for what I am convinced will never happen; ever &s;ince the exi&s;tence of the navagation act, all the maritime nations, in Europe, have been adopting mea&s;ures, in &s;ome degree &s;imilar, and now when com|merce has become the fir&s;t object, with all of them, and is &s;o well under&s;tood, they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily pur&s;ue the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>The armed neutrality was a mere temporary expedient, France furni&s;hed her i&s;lands with provi&s;ions by it, but &s;he lo&s;t the commerce of them, for the time, &s;he &s;upplied her|&s;elf, with timber, and naval &s;tores, and manned her &s;leets by it, but &s;he laid the ax to the root of her navigation and commerce, &s;o long as it exi&s;ted, and &s;he was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of this, that on the day of &s;igning the preliminaries for peace with Great-Britain, &s;he gave orders to exclude all foreign|ers from her We&s;t-Indies; and the Dutch who expected to gain, lo&s;t the mo&s;t by the armed neutrality; the con&s;e|quences of it, and the war, into which their republic was drawn by it, will be long and &s;en&s;ibly &s;elt by their com|merce, perhaps never recovered.</P>
<P>The great object, with Lord Sheffield, is to urge this government, to per&s;evere in a &s;y&s;tem, which for more than a century pa&s;t, the nation has never deviated from, and which all the maritime, and commercial nations in Europe, are now coming into.&mdash;Can any one complain of his Lord|&s;hip, on this account? Or &s;uppo&s;e that the Briti&s;h govern|ment, would not have done this, without foreign advice? Without information and coun&s;el given by me? It is too ridiculous to merit any &s;erious ob&s;ervations, or comment on, yet in&s;inuations and reports of this kind, once &s;pread have a mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing, and la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion on the minds of hone&s;t, and un&s;u&s;pecting people, who judging of others by them&s;elves, cannot &s;u&s;pect that any one, can be ba&s;e and wicked enough, to take up his pen, merely with the view of impo&s;ing on them.</P>
