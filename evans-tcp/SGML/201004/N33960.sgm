<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE de&s;ign of the en&s;uing Sections is not to amu&s;e the fancy, or gratify the curio&s;i|ty, of any; nor are they &s;ent out into the world with any expectation that the perform|ance will procure to the author the applau&s;e of mankind. If they may prove &s;ub&s;ervient to awaken the con&s;ciences of tho&s;e who have any love to the bleeding cau&s;e of Zion, and in this way, become effectual to revive the true &s;pirit of di&s;cipline and brotherly watchfulne&s;s in the churches, the author will e&s;teem him&s;elf re|warded a thou&s;and fold; and all the contempt that may be ca&s;t upon him, to be infinitely overbalanced.</P>
<P>I had fully intended to have reduced the ar|guments &amp; illu&s;trations under the &s;everal heads to a form much more conci&s;e than that in which they now appear: but con&s;idering the piece as being intended for all capacities, and that it is of importance that the force &amp; weight of every &s;entiment be fully under&s;tood, I had rather &s;uffer the impeachment from the learned &amp; judicious of being &s;omewhat too repetitious, than to have any &s;entiment pa&s;s without being fully under&s;tood by tho&s;e of more vulgar ca|pacities.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="044516_0003_101E0E296E3B1D10">If any &s;hould be convinced, that what is aimed at and enforced in the en&s;uing Sections is indeed according to that order which the great King and head of the church ever meant &s;hould take place among&s;t the people called by his name, this conviction mu&s;t &s;urely bind him to u&s;e his utmo&s;t endeavours to reduce things to &s;uch order in the hou&s;e of God, at every hazard, &amp; at the ri&s;que of every con&s;equence; and to refrain pur&s;uing &s;uch an object under the influence of any motive whatever, mu&s;t &s;urely expo&s;e him to be condemned out of his own mouth, that &s;ome beloved object lies nearer his heart than the honour of that Redeemer whom he has profe&s;&s;ed to love more than father or mother, wife or children, hou&s;es or lands, or his own life.</P>
<P>Our ruin is certainly near, even at the door, if the Lord do not interpo&s;e to recover us. To his ble&s;&s;ing, therefore, the en&s;uing Sections are devoutly recommended.</P>

And why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I &s;ay?</Q> <HI>SECTION I.</HI> The words explained.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is no doubtful interpreta|tion to the&s;e words: and &s;hould they be applied to the relation that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between a temporal prince &amp; his &s;ubjects, they would be readily under&s;tood, and the meaning of them would be obvious to the meane&s;t ca|pacity. Should the prince expo&s;tulate with his &s;ubjects by &s;uch an interrogation, and ad|dre&s;s them in this manner, they would imme|diately under&s;tand him as meaning to upbraid them with paying no regard to the laws of his kingdom, whil&s;t they profe&s;&s;ed to own him for their king; and that he e&s;teemed it no honour at all, but rather an in&s;ult upon his dignity, for them to profe&s;s to own him for their king, &amp; at the &s;ame time pay no regard to the laws of his kingdom. Should a people have recour&s;e to a round of ful&s;ome compliment and empty
<PB N="6" REF="044516_0005_101E0E3306B27658">
flattery with a view to plea&s;e their prince, and expect that he would look upon him&s;elf as be|ing honoured by them, whil&s;t at the &s;ame time they trampled his laws under foot in his pre|&s;ence, they mu&s;t be fully confident, that their prince was void of the under&s;tanding of a child, and knew not his right hand from his left. For any to attempt to treat a temporal prince in this manner, we readily know would be at the peril of their lives; and that if the prince meant to maintain the dignity of his kingdom, he would very quickly teach them, by the &s;e|vere&s;t tokens of his di&s;plea&s;ure, the horrid in|&s;ult and daring pre&s;umption of &s;uch conduct.</P>
<P>This would be the light in which a temporal prince would be under&s;tood by one and all, upon his expo&s;tulating with his &s;ubjects in this manner, And why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I &s;ay? And the mean|ing of the&s;e words is as plain in reference to that &s;ubjection we owe to him whom we pro|fe&s;s to own for our Lord and ma&s;ter. Every one is &s;en&s;ible of the ab&s;urdity of a people's profe&s;&s;ing to own a temporal prince for their king, and at the &s;ame time pay no regard to the laws of his kingdom: and they fully &s;ee, at fir&s;t view, the horrid in&s;ult this people would be guilty of, &s;hould they profe&s;s a high vene|ration for their king, and at the &s;ame time trample on the laws of his kingdom in his pre&s;ence. And they would, <HI>on the &s;ame prin|ciple,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="044516_0006_101E0E348912AD78">
&s;ee things in this point of light in refe|rence to the relation between Chri&s;t and the profe&s;&s;ed &s;ubjects of his kingdom, were it not &s;o that they love darkne&s;s rather than light.</P>

<HEAD><Q>And why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I &s;ay?</Q> <HI>SECTION II.</HI> The words further explained.</HEAD>
<P>THE interrogation contained in the&s;e words is to be under&s;tood as being addre&s;&s;ed to the &s;ubjects of Chri&s;t's kingdom at large, in every age of the world. And when applied to tho&s;e bodies who are incorporated together by &s;olemn covenant, we may have a clear un|der&s;tanding of their meaning by having recour&s;e to the light in which they would be under&s;tood when made u&s;e of by a temporal prince in ad|dre&s;&s;ing his people at large. If an earthly prince &s;hould call upon his &s;ubjects at large to <HI>do the things which he had &s;aid,</HI> they would readily under&s;tand him to mean that every one, in his proper &s;tation, &s;hould take heed, not only to govern his own <HI>per&s;onal</HI> conduct by a regard to what was enjoined in the laws of his kingdom; but al&s;o that they &s;ee to it that his authority was reverenced, and his laws regard|ed by one and all incorporated together under his protection and dominion. Nothing is more e&s;&s;ential to the honour of a prince, than the faithful execution of the laws of his kingdom;
<PB N="8" REF="044516_0007_101E0E360DF038D8">
and nothing will bring contempt on the dignity of his government &s;o &s;peedily and effectually, as to di&s;pen&s;e with the execution of his laws, by &s;uffering them to be treated with defiance and neglect. If the laws of a prince are not put into execution, they are not treated <HI>as laws,</HI> but only <HI>as empty declarations</HI> that have no force. The penalty annexed to a law, is the whole of that which gives force and energy to the law, and renders it of the nature of a law. Take away this, and it cea&s;es to be a law, and nothing remains but a meer empty declaration, by which a people are under no bonds to go|vern and regulate their conduct. And if the penalties annexed to the laws of a prince are not exacted, and the laws of his kingdom are not put into execution by tho&s;e appointed for this purpo&s;e, the force and authority of his laws are as effectually made void as if no pe|nalties were annexed to them. Nay more, for a temporal prince to &s;uffer things to go on at &s;uch a rate among the &s;ubjects of his kingdom, would be a more effectual way to teach them to treat him with contempt, than if he had never made any law for the regulation of their conduct, but had thrown the reins upon the necks of one and all, and gave unlimited in|dulgence to do as they plea&s;e. The honour of a temporal prince is <HI>too &s;acred</HI> to be trifled with in this manner. If tho&s;e whom he has ap|pointed to put his laws into execution &s;hould
<PB N="9" REF="044516_0008_101E0E3AB38F7298">
be convicted before him of having been inat|tentive to the duties of their office, and of &s;uf|fering his laws to be trampled under foot by others, it would be in vain for them to plead that they had ever took heed to govern their own <HI>per&s;onal</HI> conduct by a regard to the laws of their prince. There is no one but would be a&s;hamed to offer &s;uch a trifling plea to a governor; for they would know he would not accept it. Nothing is more plain to the under|&s;tanding of every per&s;on, than the&s;e things, when applied to that relation which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between a temporal prince and his &s;ubjects. And why the&s;e things are not as plain, <HI>on the &s;ame principles,</HI> and as ea&s;y to be under&s;tood, in reference to that relation that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts be|tween Chri&s;t and the profe&s;&s;ed &s;ubjects of his vi&s;ible kingdom, can be accounted for in no other way than this, that mankind do <HI>hate the light, neither will they come unto it, le&s;t their deeds &s;hould be made manife&s;t and reproved.</HI></P>

<HEAD><Q>And why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I &s;ay?</Q> <HI>SECTION III.</HI> The words explained in another point of view.</HEAD>
<P>WE readily under&s;tand, that if a temporal prince &s;hould require it of his &s;ubjects <HI>to do the things which he has &s;aid,</HI> his meaning would be, that the laws of his kingdom were to be the <HI>only</HI> rule of their civil conduct. They
<PB N="10" REF="044516_0009_101E0E3F5CE15750">
would never dream that their prince would in|dulge them in &s;ub&s;tituting <HI>any other</HI> &s;y&s;tem of laws for the regulation of their civil conduct, in the room of tho&s;e which he had enacted for this purpo&s;e. For any of his &s;ubjects, when arraigned before their prince for the violation of any of the laws of <HI>his</HI> kingdom, to plead that their conduct was agreeable to what was allowed by the laws of <HI>&s;ome other kingdom,</HI> would be the highe&s;t affront they could offer to their prince; and would amount to an open declaration that they meant to ca&s;t off their al|legiance to their prince, and be &s;ubject to the authority of &s;ome other king. Mankind dare not offer &s;uch pleas to their earthly governors; for they fully under&s;tand, that a temporal prince does ever expect that <HI>the laws of his kingdom,</HI> and <HI>no other laws,</HI> are regarded by his &s;ubjects as the only rule of their civil con|duct And if mankind had not their under|&s;tandings darkened by a deep-rooted, invete|rate, perver&s;e reli&s;h for wicked things, they would as readily view the&s;e things in the &s;ame point of light in reference to the relation that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between Chri&s;t and the profe&s;&s;ed &s;ub|jects of his vi&s;ible kingdom. <HI>What he has &s;aid,</HI> and the laws of his kingdom, would be regard|ed by them as the <HI>only</HI> rule of their conduct: and they would no more think of having re|cour&s;e to <HI>any other &s;tandard</HI> to mea&s;ure their conduct by, than the &s;ubjects of a temporal
<PB N="11" REF="044516_0010_101E0E426C68BA88">
prince would think of pleading in arre&s;t of judgment, that their conduct was agreeable to what was allowed by the laws of &s;ome other kingdom.</P>

<HEAD><Q>And why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I &s;ay?</Q> <HI>SECTION IV.</HI> That profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians in general have no claim to the character which they have a&s;&s;umed.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is no corporation of chri&s;tians but what do profe&s;s to own Chri&s;t for their Lord; and there is nothing which they do va|lue them&s;elves by more highly, than the cha|racter of their being the &s;ubjects of Chri&s;t. Their fondne&s;s for this is &s;o eager and &s;trong, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to fire the indignation of a man to a higher degree, than by charging it upon him that he is de&s;titute of religion. But if it &s;hall appear, that profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians in general are not governed in the tenor of their vi&s;ible conduct by a regard to what Chri&s;t has &s;aid and enjoined in his word, there will need nothing more to prove that they are not his vi&s;ible &s;ubjects. For &s;urely it is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive, that any can be the vi&s;ible <HI>&s;ubjects</HI> of Chri&s;t, unle&s;s they are in a vi&s;ible <HI>&s;ubjection</HI> to him. So far as any do appear to be in &s;ubjec|tion to Chri&s;t, &s;o far do they appear to be his &s;ubjects; and neither &s;cripture nor common &s;en&s;e will admit of any other rule to judge by
<PB N="12" REF="044516_0011_101E0E43EF3D0868">
in this matter. And what is it that we mean by a vi&s;ible &s;ubjection to Chri&s;t? The an&s;wer is plain; and it is obvious to the under&s;tand|ing of a child. So far as a per&s;on appears to be governed in the <HI>prevailing</HI> tenor of his con|duct by a &s;acred regard to what Chri&s;t has &s;aid and enjoined in his word, &s;o far is he in a vi&s;i|ble &s;ubjection to Chri&s;t, and no farther. And this being the <HI>&s;ole criterion</HI> whereby to mea&s;ure the vi&s;ible &s;ubjection of profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians to Chri&s;t as their Lord, and King, the very men|tioning of it is &s;urely &s;ufficient to fla&s;h convic|tion in every brea&s;t, that there is no vi&s;ible &s;ubjection to Chri&s;t among&s;t tho&s;e in general who profe&s;s to own him for their Lord. If any are di&s;po&s;ed to think that this is too bold and uncharitable an a&s;&s;ertion concerning pro|fe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians, I would only remind them, that whil&s;t they tax the author with the charge of uncharitablene&s;s in a&s;&s;erting &s;uch a thing concerning profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians in general, they are a&s;&s;erting the &s;ame thing concerning one another, and concerning profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians in general, every day of their lives. If a per|&s;on &s;hould openly declare that he could put no confidence in his chri&s;tian brethren, it would be the very &s;ame thing as if he &s;hould declare that he does not look upon it that they mean to be in &s;ubjection to Chri&s;t. And if profe&s;&s;|ing chri&s;tians <HI>conduct</HI> towards one another in &s;uch a manner as to demon&s;trate that they can
<PB N="13" REF="044516_0012_101E0E4600963520">
put no confidence in each other, it is &s;urely e|qual to their openly declaring in the plaine&s;t manner, and in the loude&s;t accents of language, that they have this per&s;ua&s;ion concerning each other, that they do not mean or intend to be governed by a regard to what Chri&s;t has &s;aid and enjoined in his word. For it is impo&s;&s;ible to withhold their confidence towards one ano|ther on any other principle than &s;uch an ap|prehen&s;ion and per&s;ua&s;ion concerning each o|ther. And by chri&s;tians putting confidence in each other, I would be under&s;tood to mean that confidence only which is agreeable to their profe&s;&s;ion. We put confidence in gentlemen as gentlemen; in men of honor as men of ho|nor. That is, there are certain rules which gentlemen mean ever to ob&s;erve in the manner of their treating others; and when we have found out what their rules are, we are confi|dent what treatment we &s;hall receive from a man who wears the character of a gentleman. There are certain principles which men of ho|nor profe&s;s ever to act from in their dealings with others; and when we have found what the&s;e principles are, we are confident how they will deal with us upon every occa&s;ion. But if we put confidence in a profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tian un|der an apprehen&s;ion or on the warrant of his being a gentleman or a man of honor, we don't put confidence in him as a chri&s;tian; and the exerci&s;e of &s;uch confidence is no mark at all of
<PB N="14" REF="044516_0013_101E0E4DB1C9A6B8">
any charity towards him. If the confidence of profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians one towards another is not founded upon a mutual apprehen&s;ion that each other is governed by a &s;acred regard to what Chri&s;t has &s;aid and enjoined in his word, there is no chri&s;tian confidence, and con&s;equently no chri&s;tian charity among&s;t them. And &s;urely there is no need of any labor to prove that there is nothing of <HI>this</HI> mutual confidence to be &s;een in the conduct of profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tans in gene|ral one towards another. We know it by in|tuition, in the &s;ame manner as we know we &s;ee the light of the &s;un at noon day, whil&s;t we are &s;urrounded and covered with its rays. And we furthermore know, that it is ab&s;olutely im|po&s;&s;ible for profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians to have <HI>this</HI> mutual confidence towards each other, whil&s;t they evidently &s;ee that they are &s;o commonly di&s;po&s;ed to bite and devour one another, by &s;eeking to get the advantage of each other in their commerce and dealings; or to &s;lander, backbite, and reproach one another; or to be unfaithful in fulfilling their promi&s;es and mu|tual engagements to each other; or to be in|&s;en&s;ible of the wants and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of each other. Where the&s;e things are to be &s;een, as being manife&s;tly allowed and indulged, in the open conduct of profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians, it is as abhorrent to every dictate of common &s;en&s;e to believe concerning them that they mean or in|tend to do as the word of God enjoins, as it
<PB N="15" REF="044516_0014_101E0E4F32F9D5D0">
would be to think that they are employed, every day of their lives, in working miracles after the example of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles. And whil&s;t it is impo&s;&s;ible, on &s;uch a principle as this, for profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians to put mutual confidence in each other, nothing more is needful to prove out this point, that there is no vi&s;ibility of &s;ubjection to Chri&s;t among&s;t tho&s;e in general who profe&s;s to own him for their Lord. They are &s;wift witne&s;&s;es again&s;t them&s;elves &amp; again&s;t one another, that their practice does, every day, give their profe&s;&s;ion the lie; and that it is the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of their lives to mock &amp; in&s;ult the Redeemer, whil&s;t they call him Lord, Lord, &amp; do not the things which he has &s;aid.</P>

<HEAD><Q>And why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I &s;ay?</Q> <HI>SECTION V.</HI> A further illu&s;tration of the &s;ame point.</HEAD>
<P>THAT profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians in general have no claim to the character which they have a&s;&s;umed, is &s;o evident as to be generally, if not univer&s;ally, acknowledged &amp; a&s;&s;ented to. They are &s;o generally and univer&s;ally &s;en&s;ible, when they make a &s;olemn profe&s;&s;ion, that they have no meaning at all to their covenant vows, that they dare not put confidence in one another on the warrant of tho&s;e bonds which the&s;e vows do lay them under. In exerci&s;ing confidence in each o|ther, they dare not venture any further than they
<PB N="16" REF="044516_0015_101DC0A688AF86A8">
are under bonds, &amp; are holden to each other by the laws, u&s;ages, &amp; cu&s;toms of the &s;tate where they dwell. And when the&s;e laws, u&s;ages, and cu&s;toms are the &s;ole foundation of that mutual confidence which profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians do exer|ci&s;e in each other, <HI>what do they more than others?</HI> They might as well exerci&s;e <HI>this</HI> confidence in one another, if they had never made any pro|fe&s;&s;ion of the chri&s;tian religion at all: for it is the <HI>&s;ame kind</HI> of mutual confidence, and found|ed upon the &s;ame warrant, as the civilized hea|thens, yea, and the very barbarians through|out the world, do univer&s;ally exerci&s;e one to|wards another. Nothing is more evident than that <HI>this kind</HI> of mutual confidence has not the lea&s;t degree of chri&s;tian charity in it; and let it be exerci&s;ed to ever &s;o high a degree, it gives not the lea&s;t evidence that profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians do believe that each other have any meaning at all to their &s;olemn covenant vows. Nay, whil&s;t they exerci&s;e a mutual confidence in each other on the warrant of tho&s;e bonds they are under by the laws, u&s;ages, and cu&s;toms of the &s;tate where they live; whil&s;t the&s;e laws, u|&s;ages and cu&s;toms are the &s;ole foundation of their mutual confidence in each other, and the &s;ole rule and mea&s;ure of that confidence which they exerci&s;e in each other, and they dare not tru&s;t one another but only in &s;uch a way as <HI>the&s;e bonds</HI> will hold them; it is certainly a de|mon&s;tration that they have no idea or expec|tations
<PB N="17" REF="044516_0016_101E0E5247084B00">
that profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians do mean to be held by <HI>any other kind of bonds</HI> than what they are under by the laws, u&s;ages and cu&s;toms of the &s;tate where they live; and con&s;equently that they have no meaning at all to their co|venant vows. For &s;urely &s;o far forth as there is any meaning to tho&s;e &s;olemn covenant vows that chri&s;tians are under, <HI>the&s;e</HI> would hold them mo&s;t &s;acredly to the faithful di&s;charge of every duty and engagement that they owe to each other, without the intervention of any other kind of bonds whatever. And if it is <HI>any o|ther bonds</HI> that hold them to be faithful to each other in any in&s;tance; and if they will not be faithful to each other, <HI>without being holden by other bonds;</HI> it is not the authority of Chri&s;t that governs them; neither do they do any thing at all in his name; but they are govern|ed in the whole of their conduct by a regard to the authority of the laws, u&s;ages and cu&s;toms of the world; and this authority is &s;upreme in their views, and they exalt it into the throne of God, whil&s;t it is not only the <HI>highe&s;t,</HI> but the <HI>only</HI> authority which, in their practice, they bow down before, and to which they yield &s;ub|jection. It is impo&s;&s;ible that profe&s;sing chri&s;|tians can be in &s;ubjection to Chri&s;t, whil&s;t this is the tenor of their conduct; for <HI>to whom&s;o|ever you yield your&s;elves &s;ervants to obey, his &s;er|vants you are to whom you obey;</HI> and he is your Lord to who&s;e authority you are in &s;ubjection.</P>

<P>ENOUGH has been &s;aid to prove out this point, that profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians in general do not mean or intend to have their vi&s;ible con|duct governed by a regard to what Chri&s;t has &s;aid and enjoined in his word.

There is no &s;tate or kingdom on earth, either among the civilized heathens, or the rude&s;t barbarians, the autho|rity of which is treated with &s;uch in&s;olence and contempt as the authority of Chri&s;t is treated by tho&s;e who are incorporated together as mem|bers of his vi&s;ible kingdom. When tho&s;e who dwell together in any certain &s;tate or kingdom come under obligations to each other accord|ing to the laws of the &s;tate or kingdom they are under, the authority of <HI>the&s;e</HI> laws is too &s;a|cred to &s;uffer &s;uch obligations to be trifled with or violated. And if you can find out what are
<PB N="19" REF="044516_0018_101E0E5B97D45F50">
the laws, u&s;ages and cu&s;toms of the mo&s;t igno|rant and unpoli&s;hed barbarians, you are at once convinced how far you may put confidence in them. Only take heed that the confidence you put in them is founded upon the laws, u&s;ages and cu&s;toms by which they are govern|ed, and you are entirely &s;afe: for the authori|ty of the&s;e laws, u&s;ages and cu&s;toms, will bind them to a faithful di&s;charge of tho&s;e obligati|ons they come under to you. On this princi|ple it is always &s;afe for mankind, in every age of the world, and among&s;t all nations, to put confidence in one another, only provided their confidence is founded upon the authority of tho&s;e laws by which they are governed. So &s;acred is the authority of the kingdoms of this world, that mankind dare not trifle in matters where <HI>this</HI> authority binds them. But is it &s;o, in any degree of compari&s;on, where men are under bonds to each other by the authority of Chri&s;t? When a man has &s;worn allegiance to Chri&s;t, and has &s;olemnly profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a member of his vi&s;ible kingdom; have we, in a general way, any more warrant to expect that he means to govern his conduct by a regard to the true &s;pirit &amp; plain meaning of his covenant vows, than we have to expect that we &s;hall find his conduct according to the precepts of Maho|met's alcoran? And &s;urely there is &s;ome pow|erful rea&s;on why things &s;hould be &s;o infinitely different in Chri&s;t's kingdom from what they
<PB N="20" REF="044516_0019_101E0E5D19D799C0">

<P>What can be the rea&s;on that we can readily put confidence in a man on the warrant of tho&s;e bonds he is under by the laws of the land, and can put no confidence in him on the warrant of tho&s;e bonds he is under by the laws of Chri&s;t? Why are the laws of an earthly king|dom, and the authority of the&s;e laws, &s;o much more powerful to bind men to the faithful di&s;|charge of tho&s;e bonds which the&s;e laws lay them under, than the laws of Chri&s;t's kingdom, and the authority of his laws, are to bind men to the faithful di&s;charge of tho&s;e duties which his laws do enjoin? <HI>It is becau&s;e the laws of one kingdom are faithfully executed, and the laws of the other are &s;uffered to be treated with con|tempt and defiance.</HI> If the laws of any earthly kingdom &s;hould not be executed, but one and all &s;hould be &s;uffered to trample upon them as they plea&s;e, &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of laws would &s;oon lo&s;e all their energy, and that people would be in a &s;tate of more ab&s;olute anarchy and confu|&s;ion, than if they had no law among&s;t them. The faithful execution of the laws of any king|dom, is the whole of that which gives force &amp; energy to the laws of that kingdom; and in proportion as the laws of any kingdom are faithfully executed, will the&s;e laws be revered
<PB N="21" REF="044516_0020_101E0E5ED61D7BD8">
and obeyed by the &s;ubjects of that kingdom; <HI>and there is nothing el&s;e, there is no other expe|dient,</HI> whereby it is po&s;&s;ible to bring a people into a vi&s;ible &s;ubjection to the laws of any kingdom whatever, and to form their conduct and manners according to the true &s;pirit and plain meaning of the laws of that kingdom. The vi&s;ible temper, conduct, and manners of a people, will be according to the true &s;pirit and plain meaning of what is pointed out and enjoined in the laws of the kingdom to which they are &s;ubject, in proportion to the faithful|ne&s;s with which the laws of that kingdom are executed. It is impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be other|wi&s;e; for this being the order and practice of a kingdom, tho&s;e who &s;hould remain openly and vi&s;ibly di&s;obedient to what the laws of the kingdom did enjoin, the operation of the laws would of cour&s;e &s;pue them out of the limits of the kingdom.</P>
<P>This one ob&s;ervation does certainly demon|&s;trate, and nothing more is needed to prove, that the laws of Chri&s;t's kingdom are not ex|ecuted in his hou&s;e; and that this is the capital and highe&s;t rea&s;on why the vi&s;ible conduct of profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians is not according to what is pointed out and enjoined in the laws of this kingdom: for &s;urely, were it &s;o that the laws of Chri&s;t's kingdom were faithfully executed, there would ever be as much of a foundation for chri&s;tians to put confidence in one another

on the warrant of tho&s;e bonds they are under by the authority of Chri&s;t, as there now is among&s;t the members of any civil kingdom to put confidence in each other on the warrant of tho&s;e bonds which the laws of the kingdom do lay them under. The execution of the laws of Chri&s;t's kingdom would &s;urely render the&s;e laws as powerful to govern the vi&s;ible conduct of profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians, as the execution of the laws of any earthly kingdom does ever render the laws of that kingdom powerful to govern the civil conduct of its &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>The only rea&s;on why one man can have con|fidence in another on the warrant of his being under bonds by the laws of the land, is found|ed in this, that if he refu&s;es to an&s;wer his en|gagements, that law will be executed upon him which will oblige him to a punctual fulfil|ment of his covenant. And had we the like warrant for our confidence, that the laws of Chri&s;t's kingdom would be put into execution again&s;t every one that &s;hould turn his back up|on the path of his duty, there would ever be the &s;ame foundation for confidence that the members of his vi&s;ible kingdom would walk according to their high and holy calling: and the capital rea&s;on why it is not &s;o, and profe&s;&s;|ing chri&s;tians in general are &s;o entirely conform|ed to the world in their vi&s;ible conduct, that we can di&s;cern no difference between them and the re&s;t of the world, is, becau&s;e the laws of

<P>THERE is no corporation among&s;t man|kind but what are ready to per&s;uade them&s;elves, and would have it tho't by others, that it is their meaning to be governed by the laws of their corporation, and to put the&s;e laws into execution.

On this principle tho&s;e who are incorporated together by &s;olemn covenant, as members of Chri&s;t's vi&s;ible king|dom, would fain per&s;uade them&s;elves, and have

others think, that it is their meaning to be go|verned in the whole of their conduct, by a re|gard to the laws of Chri&s;t's kingdom, and to put the&s;e laws into execution.

<P>And hence we may be &s;ure, that notwith|&s;tanding all that has been &s;aid to prove that the laws of Chri&s;t's kingdom are not executed in his hou&s;e, profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians in general will labor mo&s;t eagerly to per&s;uade them&s;elves, and have others believe, that it <HI>is</HI> their meaning to govern them&s;elves by a regard to the laws of Chri&s;t's kingdom, and to do what in them lies to put the&s;e laws into execution. And on this principle many will feel a &s;urprize that any one &s;hould a&s;&s;ert that the laws of Chri&s;t's kingdom are not executed in the churches that profe&s;s to

own him for their Lord; and will be confident that &s;uch an a&s;&s;ertion does favour of unchari|table arrogance, and unwarrantable boldne&s;s; and that the churches in general are un&s;uffera|bly abu&s;ed by &s;uch an a&s;&s;ertion. Surely if the author had taken pains to acquaint him&s;elf with the practice of churches in general, he might have known that they do not mean to allow of any gro&s;s tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions in the conduct of their members, &s;uch as open profanene&s;s, &s;tealing, lying, &amp;c. It is not the de&s;ign of the author to di&s;pute or call in que&s;tion the truth of &s;uch an a&s;&s;ertion. Let it be granted that churches do keep up a careful watch over the conduct of their members to keep them from &s;uch gro&s;s tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; if they mean to go no further in exerci&s;ing the di&s;cipline of God's hou&s;e than to &s;uppre&s;s the out-breakings of &s;uch kinds of open wickedne&s;s in the conduct of their members; this is &s;o far from being an evidence that they have it in view to put the laws of Chri&s;t into execution, that it is a full demon&s;tration to the contrary. For whil&s;t they will di&s;cipline their members for &s;uch gro&s;s tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and yet at the &s;ame time, indulge and pa&s;s over that conduct in them which the word of God does as ab&s;olutely abhor, and as &s;olemnly condemn, as it does any of tho&s;e gro&s;s tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, the laws of Chri&s;t's kingdom are not the rule of their conduct, and they have no reference at all, either to the will or the autho|rity
<PB N="26" REF="044516_0025_101E0E6FE6D4D778">
of Chri&s;t in dealing with and di&s;ciplining their members. Upon what principle can it be that churches will deal with their members for &s;tealing, and yet at the &s;ame time will in|dulge and pa&s;s over that conduct in them which is as direct and daring a violation of that rule of equity, <HI>What&s;oever ye would that men &s;hould do unto you, do ye the &s;ame unto them, as &s;tealing it of the eighth command?</HI> For it is evident to the under&s;tanding of a child, and to the com|mon &s;en&s;e of every per&s;on, that profe&s;&s;ors are indulged in &s;uch conduct whil&s;t it is a common thing among them to bite and devour, to grind and oppre&s;s, to backbite and defame one ano|ther. And now is it that churches apprehend that the eighth command is more &s;acred in the eye of the Redeemer than the great rule of e|quity, that they will deal with their members for the open violation of the one, and pa&s;s over that conduct in them which is as daring a vi|olation of the other? They dare not pretend this. And hence there is no other rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned for this conduct in churches in con|demning the gro&s;s violations of the eighth com|mand, and pa&s;&s;ing over the open violations of the great rule of equity, but this, <HI>That the world condemns the one and not the other.</HI> The gro&s;s violations of the eighth command are univer|&s;ally condemned by the laws, u&s;ages and cu&s;|toms of the world; and if churches &s;hould not condemn <HI>&s;uch</HI> conduct in their members, <HI>the

If the laws of Chri&s;t's kingdom were the <HI>rule of their conduct</HI> in their proceedings, they would &s;urely be ready to condemn <HI>every</HI> thing in the open conduct of their members, which the laws of this kingdom do condemn.

And the matter is mo&s;t plain in reference to the point under con&s;ideration. The laws of Chri&s;t's
<PB N="30" REF="044516_0029_101E0E7C31DAE0E0">

<P>The world is our God, if its cu&s;toms are the rule of our conduct. If our eye is upon the&s;e cu&s;toms as the rule we mean to walk by, we are guilty of <HI>open</HI> idolatry as evidently as Je|reboam ever was in &s;etting up his golden calves in Bethel and Dan: and all the difference be|tween our conduct and that of Jereboam, is this, that we don't wor&s;hip the <HI>&s;ame idol</HI> as he wor&s;hiped &mdash;in&s;tead of wor&s;hiping his golden calves, we have &s;et up the world in their &s;tead: and nothing can be more evident, than that the cu&s;toms of the world are the highe&s;t and ulti|mate rule that profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians do mean to

And there is no need of any labour to prove, that there <HI>is</HI> that vi&s;i|ble conduct in profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians in general, which the word of God does ab&s;olutely con|demn; and con&s;equently, that &s;uch conduct is openly allowed of and tolerated in the churches that profe&s;s to be in &s;ubjection to Chri&s;t, as their Lord: for if there <HI>is</HI> &s;uch open &amp; vi&s;ible conduct among&s;t profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians, it is cer|tainly tolerated and allowed of: for if it were not tolerated and allowed of, it could not take place. And for any one to a&s;k, whether the vi&s;ible conduct of tho&s;e in general who make a profe&s;&s;ion of religion, is agreeable to the true &s;pirit and plain meaning of what the word of God enjoins, would be an inquiry mo&s;t palpably ridiculous, even in the mouth of a child. The contrary is &s;o evident, and &s;o uni|ver&s;ally known, that profe&s;&s;ors them&s;elves dare not put confidence in one another on the war|rant of tho&s;e bonds they are under to each other by virtue of the oath of their allegiance to Chri&s;t.

But if a man were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all other endowments that can be conceived of, and &s;hould he arrive to &s;uch attainments as to <HI>&s;peak with the tongue of men, and of angels;</HI> or &s;hould he be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o much natural &s;ympathy, and human com|pa&s;&s;ion, as <HI>to give all his goods to feed the poor;</HI> and &s;hould he make &s;uch a &s;hew of zeal for God and his cau&s;e as <HI>to give his body to be burn|ed;</HI> and yet not be governed by, or act out <HI>this temper,</HI> in the&s;e tran&s;actions, he would be no|thing in the &s;ight of God. In this view of the matter we need be at no lo&s;s at all to know, what is that <HI>particular line of conduct</HI> which is pointed out and enjoined by the laws of Chri&s;t's kingdom, and which is ab&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential for tho&s;e who mean to be in a vi&s;ible &s;ubjection to him as their Lord and King. It is &s;uch a line
<PB N="35" REF="044516_0034_101E0E8D6D0A9038">
of conduct as is agreeable to the true &s;pirit and plain meaning of the great law of love.

<P>Churches in general appear to have &s;ome apprehen&s;ion that they are under &s;acred bonds to deal with their members for open profane|ne&s;s, if any among&s;t them appear to be noto|riou&s;ly guilty of &s;uch a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.

<P>THERE is nothing more certain than this, that profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians will <HI>yet</HI> continue to flatter them&s;elves that it is their meaning to do the things which Chri&s;t has &s;aid, &s;o far as it is in the power of their hands.

No one ever argues, that we have rea&s;on to <HI>hope</HI> that there is any real love between parents and chil|dren, hu&s;bands and wives, where there is no love acted out and manife&s;ted in their conduct one towards another. <HI>This kind</HI> of love is &s;o plainly &s;een, as to be obvious to the under|&s;tandings of all, and children them&s;elves are competent judges of it.

of the &s;ouls of each other is the primary object of that love which chri&s;tians are to exerci&s;e one towards another.

And if a per&s;on does truly mean to ma|nife&s;t any concern for the welfare and happi|ne&s;s of his own &s;oul, he will &s;urely manife&s;t it by a continual &s;acred care to &s;tand at the re|mote&s;t di&s;tance from evil, and the appearance of evil: and there is no way for chri&s;tians to manife&s;t and act out a mutual love and concern for the welfare of the &s;ouls of each other, as by &s;etting their faces again&s;t evil, and the ap|pearance of evil, in each other. If a parent &s;hould &s;uffer his child to walk upon the edge of a dangerous precipice, without a mo&s;t watchful care to prevent him, and without in|terpo&s;ing all his authority to reclaim him from that dangerous &s;ituation, we &s;hould mo&s;t readi|ly judge that &s;uch a parent was an unnatural mon&s;ter, void of natural affection, and that the life of his child was of no great account with him.

&s;uffer evil, or the appearance of evil, in each other, it is equally evident, that they are ut|terly de&s;titute of any genuine love or concern for the welfare of the &s;ouls of each other. In this view of the matter, it manife&s;tly appears, that for chri&s;tians to &s;uffer evil, &amp; the appear|ance of evil, upon each other, is directly con|trary to that line of conduct which the great law of love requires and enjoins.

When any one beholds that conduct in another, which, <HI>in his view,</HI> the word of God condemns, however agreeable it may be to the modes &amp; cu&s;toms of the world, he is bound mo&s;t &s;acredly, by the great law of love, and <HI>the whole weight</HI> of his covenant vows lies upon him, to reclaim him to a &s;en&s;e of his evil, and to recover him to the path of his duty. And where one &s;ees only the appearance of evil in another, the vows of God, and the great law of love, do unite to bind him mo&s;t &s;acredly to admoni&s;h and warn him of his dan|ger: and if he neglects, his guilt becomes in|finitely
<PB N="50" REF="044516_0049_101E0EBBCC459A00">
greater than the guilt of him upon whom he &s;aw the appearance of evil; for <HI>this neglect</HI> is an <HI>open &s;candal,</HI> it being a deliberate violation of his covenant vows.</P>
<P>Nothing is more manife&s;t, than that this mutual concern for the welfare of the &s;ouls of each other among&s;t profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians, is ac|cording to the genuine operation of the great law of love. And herein, <HI>that kind of love,</HI> which is enjoined upon chri&s;tians, &s;tands di|&s;tingui&s;hed from every other kind of love among&s;t mankind. We oftentimes &s;ee that, which we are ready to <HI>call</HI> love, among&s;t tho&s;e who are di&s;po&s;ed to run to the &s;ame exce&s;s of riot, whil&s;t they will rejoice together, &amp; &s;how a ready di&s;po&s;ition to gratify one another. But that which we <HI>call</HI> love in the&s;e, is, in reality, the mo&s;t virulent hatred they can po&s;&s;ibly act out towards one another; and the devil is full of <HI>this</HI> affection towards tho&s;e whom he means to de&s;troy.</P>
<P>There is nothing that de&s;erves the name of love, or that does, in any mea&s;ure, partake of the nature of it, but that di&s;po&s;ition which aims at the mutual welfare and &s;afety of the &s;ouls of each other, by a con&s;tant endeavour to guard one another from evil, and from the appearance of evil. In this way our Saviour manife&s;ted the tendere&s;t love to mankind in the days of his abode upon earth. He was an ir|reconcilable enemy to evil, and the appearance
<PB N="51" REF="044516_0050_101E0EBD4FFF7198">
of evil, and &s;et his face like a flint, and bore the mo&s;t &s;olemn te&s;timony again&s;t it, how much &s;oever it might expo&s;e him to the rage and en|vy of tho&s;e who were di&s;po&s;ed to cavil at the truth. In this way it was manife&s;t that the law of kindne&s;s was on his tongue, and this was the con&s;tant operation of the great law of love through the whole tenor of his conduct. And this, &s;urely, is that line of conduct, which the great law of love does enjoin upon his follow|ers: and if tho&s;e who call them&s;elves his fol|lowers, can &s;uffer evil, and the appearance of evil, in one another, they may flatter them|&s;elves, that they are induced to pa&s;s over &s;uch conduct in one another, out of mutual tender|ne&s;s, and le&s;t they &s;hould di&s;turb the peace of each other, and bring on tumults and divi&s;ions in the church; and their meaning is, to put on charity for each other, tho' they frequently behold evil, and the appearance of evil, in one another: and they may be as confident, that this is the way, in which, upon the whole, it is be&s;t for them to walk, as king Saul was, that he was in the right when he &s;pared the be&s;t of the &s;heep &amp; of the oxen, among&s;t the Amelekites, to &s;acrifice unto the Lord. But their confi|dence will a&s;&s;uredly be confounded, as his was, when their Lord &s;hall demand of them, And why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I &s;ay?</P>

<HEAD><Q>And why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I &s;ay?</Q> <HI>SECTION XIV.</HI> A further illu&s;tration of the &s;ame point.</HEAD>
<P>IF it be the real meaning of profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;|tians to do the things which Chri&s;t has &s;aid, by walking together in love, and to manife&s;t a ten|der concern for the welfare and &s;tate of the &s;ouls of each other, by letting their faces again&s;t e|vil, and the appearance of evil, in each other; if this be the &s;pirit of tho&s;e bonds by which they are united together, it is evident, at fir&s;t view, that they will countenance one another in <HI>every</HI> in&s;tance wherein any one &s;ets him&s;elf to the di&s;charge of &s;uch a &s;olemn covenant duty. If they mean to walk together in the &s;pirit of this temper, it will be impo&s;&s;ible for them to re|proach any one for being grieved with the con|duct of another under a notion that &s;uch con|duct is <HI>a little thing,</HI> and ought not to be noti|ced, or treated as a matter of grievance. For let it be as it will in the view of others, if it be what the word of God abhors and condemns, in the view of the per&s;on who is grieved with it, he is &s;acredly bound to treat it as a matter of grievance. If every one who has named the name of Chri&s;t, is under covenant bonds to &s;et his face again&s;t evil, and the appearance of evil, in each other; it is manife&s;t that every one mu&s;t judge for him&s;elf, what is evil, and what wears the appearance of evil, in the vi&s;ible conduct of
<PB N="53" REF="044516_0052_101E0EC523A6B198">
tho&s;e he is in covenant with. Without the ex|erci&s;e of this judgment, it is utterly impo&s;&s;ible for individuals, as &s;uch, to quit them&s;elves of the oath of God by di&s;charging tho&s;e &s;olemn co|venant duties they owe to each other. If any one comes under blame for attempting to di&s;|charge that which he looks upon, and profe&s;&s;es to be a &s;olemn covenant duty; if he is reproach|ed for &s;o doing by tho&s;e with whom he is in covenant; and it is repre&s;ented by one another, that <HI>&s;uch a little thing</HI> ought not to be noticed; they are doing what in them lies to ca&s;t a &s;tum|bling block and an occa&s;ion to fall in their bro|ther's way. Such a body of profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;ti|ans are trying to their utmo&s;t to di&s;courage &amp; di&s;hearten one another from di&s;charging their &s;olemn covenant duty. For if this be once e|&s;tabli&s;hed that no one mu&s;t treat a matter as a matter of grievance until he is certain that it will appear to others in the &s;ame light it does to him; if he mu&s;t refrain from bearing te&s;ti|mony again&s;t that which <HI>he</HI> looks upon to be evil, or to wear the appearance of evil, until he is confident that <HI>others</HI> will not look upon it to be <HI>a little thing;</HI> that moment that things are come to &s;uch a pa&s;s in a church, there is no rule for individuals to go by in the di&s;charge of tho&s;e &s;olemn covenant duties they owe to each other. When a profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tian &s;ees that conduct in another which <HI>he</HI> looks upon to be evil, and he mu&s;t wait till he knows how tho&s;e in general
<PB N="54" REF="044516_0053_101E0EC8370E0A38">
with whom he is in covenant, will view it, or by <HI>what name</HI> they will call it, before he will venture to recover his brother to the path of his duty; <HI>this motive</HI> will be a bar in his way, and if he is <HI>governed</HI> by it, will incapacitate him from di&s;charging tho&s;e &s;olemn covenant duties which the vows of God do bind him to. If profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians do mean to walk together under the governing influence of that temper which the great law of love does enjoin; nothing is more manife&s;t than that they will have a <HI>&s;a|cred</HI> care to avoid, not only what <HI>they them&s;elves</HI> look upon to be evil, or to wear the appearance of evil; but al&s;o what they know is viewed &amp; e&s;teemed &s;o by any brother in the covenant with them. And if the eyes of profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians are not upon this as an <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> object which they mean ever to have in view, it is manife&s;t that the great law of love has become contemptible among them: for <HI>if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walke&s;t thou not charitably.</HI> If you mean to plead up for, and allow of, that which, you know, is a grief to your brother, and <HI>he views</HI> as being &s;inful; the great law of love abhors your conduct. When therefore profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians will reproach one another, on their attempting to di&s;charge a &s;olemn co|venant duty, and will urge that we mu&s;t bear with one another in <HI>things indifferent,</HI> and not take offence at &s;uch trifles; there is no way more effectual to throw down the hedge and the wall

around the church, and to turn <HI>the hou&s;e of God into a den of thieves.</HI> How confident &s;oever &s;uch may be, who conduct on <HI>&s;uch</HI> principles, that they are &s;eeking the peace of the church; and how much &s;oever they may now flatter their hearts that they are doing God &s;ervice; they will certainly find, in the end, <HI>for the mouth of the Lord hath &s;poken it,</HI> that <HI>it were better for them that a mill&s;tone were hanged about their necks, and they ca&s;t into the &s;ea, than to have offended tho&s;e little ones that believed on Chri&s;t,</HI> &amp; who would have readily di&s;charged their &s;olemn covenant vows, had it not been that the&s;e &s;tumbling blocks, and occa&s;ions to fall, had been thrown in their way.</P>

<P>IF there is any meaning at all to tho&s;e &s;o|lemn vows by which profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians have covenanted with God, and one another,&mdash;if they mean to walk together in the &s;pirit of that love to the &s;ouls of each other, which is according to the tenor of their &s;olemn covenant; they will mo&s;t &s;urely be ready, not only to &s;et their faces again&s;t evil, and the appearance of evil, in each other; but there will al&s;o be a readi|ne&s;s to <HI>receive</HI> the admonitions of one another, without re&s;entment or envy. If the law of love
<PB N="56" REF="044516_0055_101E0ECD0D448BA0">
does but govern among&s;t them, they will be ready to join i&s;&s;ue with David, <HI>Let the righteous &s;mite me</HI> when I go a&s;tray: and this will be e&s;teemed, as indeed it is, one of the greate&s;t external privileges on this &s;ide heaven. There is no one point of more &s;acred importance, in reference to the order of God's hou&s;e, than for a church to keep their members to that vi&s;ible conduct, which is according to &s;uch a temper. If profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians are indulged in de&s;pi|&s;ing reproof&mdash;if they may rai&s;e a clamour again&s;t a per&s;on, for attempting to di&s;charge a &s;olemn covenant duty&mdash;if any one may be al|lowed to &s;ugge&s;t and in&s;inuate, that &s;uch a per|&s;on is actuated by prejudice again&s;t him, tho' at the &s;ame time his vi&s;ible conduct is accord|ing to what the word of God warrants&mdash;if the&s;e things are indulged, and openly tolerated in a church; it is very certain, that there can be nothing among&s;t them but confu&s;ion, and every evil work. For a church to indulge &s;uch a line of conduct in their members, is to tole|rate them in the mo&s;t direct violation of their covenant vows; for if there is any meaning at all to tho&s;e &s;olemn vows by which profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians are bound to one another, they do <HI>certainly</HI> hold them under &s;acred bonds to heark|en to the reproofs, and to receive the admoni|tions of each other, on every occa&s;ion, with all thankfulne&s;s and readine&s;s of mind. For one to reject an admonition given him by another,
<PB N="57" REF="044516_0056_101E0ED1A6D07A48">
under a pretence that the thing for which he is admoni&s;hed, is <HI>&s;o little and trifling</HI> as not to be worthy of reproof, is <HI>a de&s;pi&s;ing his brother, and &s;etting at nought his brother</HI> for attempting to quit him&s;elf of the oath of God that is upon him. For one to reject the admonition of a brother, or to re&s;ent an attempt to recover him to the path of his duty, under a pretence that his con|duct is over-rated, and that he is dealt with too &s;everely, is the &s;ame thing as &s;etting him&s;elf up for a judge in his own ca&s;e; and is as much as if he &s;hould &s;ay, When I go a&s;tray, <HI>let the righ|teous &s;mite me,</HI> but only let him take heed to &s;mite ju&s;t &s;o hard as I order him, and no hard|er: which would be the highe&s;t kind of trifling that can be conceived of. When a brother is &s;et at nought and de&s;pi&s;ed for attempting to quit him&s;elf of the oath of God that is upon him;&mdash;when a church will &s;uffer a clamor to be rai&s;ed again&s;t him on this account; they are openly countenancing a &s;pirit of per|&s;ecution for righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;ake, and whenever this leaven gits into a church, there will be no|thing more dangerous than for one to attempt the di&s;charge of his covenant duty; and <HI>he that,</HI> in this way, <HI>departeth from evil, will make him&s;elf a prey.</HI> Every profe&s;&s;or is as &s;acredly bound to <HI>receive</HI> as his brother is to <HI>give</HI> an admonition or reproof.

<PB N="58" REF="044516_0057_101E0ED4C016C420">
<HI>deal with another,</HI> do bind that other to <HI>be wil|ling to be dealt with.</HI> The&s;e bonds are always mutual, and are as &s;acred on the <HI>one</HI> hand as they are on the <HI>other.</HI> As therefore we &s;hould very ju&s;tly look upon the per&s;on as having no meaning at all to his covenant vows, who <HI>&s;uf|fers &s;in upon his neighbour,</HI> and never &s;ets his face again&s;t evil, or the appearance of evil in others; &s;o we may be &s;ure that there is no way in which a per&s;on can treat his covenant vows with a more direct and daring defiance than by <HI>de&s;pi&s;|ing his brother, and &s;etting at nought his brother,</HI> by ca&s;ting contempt upon him for attempting to deal with him for that which <HI>he</HI> viewed to be evil.

care among&s;t them, to &s;et their faces again&s;t <HI>every</HI> thing, in the open conduct of one another, which the word of God abhors and condemns. There is no other way, in which they can aim at the welfare of the &s;ouls of each other, but by keeping their eye upon this as the <HI>only</HI> rule of their conduct, in the manner of their treat|ing one another: and if they &s;hould once learn to keep their eye upon this, as the <HI>&s;ole rule and mea&s;ure,</HI> whereby they meant to form an e&s;timate of that which is evil, or wears the appearance of evil, in the open conduct of one another; they never could pre&s;ume to call any matter <HI>a little thing,</HI> unle&s;s the word of God al&s;o call|ed the &s;ame matter <HI>a little thing.</HI> They would immediately learn to call <HI>every thing</HI> by the &s;ame name that the word of God called it; &amp; to view <HI>every thing</HI> in the &s;ame point of light as the word of God viewed it. And in this point of view, it is manife&s;t, that when one chri&s;tian brother &s;hould admoni&s;h another, for what the world calls <HI>&s;o little a thing</HI> as vain je&s;ting, ano|ther would not dare to call it <HI>a little thing,</HI> un|le&s;s he could prove that the apo&s;tle was in je&s;t, when he &s;olemnly warned his chri&s;tian brethren again&s;t this practice.</P>
<P>There are many things which the civilized part of the world call <HI>little,</HI> becau&s;e they have become common, and are generally tolerated &amp; allowed of; which, at the &s;ame time, the word of God, in the <HI>plain &s;en&s;e</HI> of it, does as ab&s;o|lutely
<PB N="60" REF="044516_0059_101E0ED807C39450">
abhor, and as &s;olemnly condemn, and which are as incon&s;i&s;tent with the character of a chri&s;tian, as tho&s;e gro&s;s tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions which the world condemns. And for chri&s;tians to indulge one another in the&s;e things, &amp; to treat them as <HI>little things,</HI> becau&s;e the <HI>world</HI> calls them &s;o, is as incon&s;i&s;tent with the leading de|&s;ign of their being covenanted together, as if they &s;hould turn the whole of their brotherly watchfulne&s;s into this channel, to help one another to get as much of the world as they could. Whatever is agreeable to the &s;pirit and reli&s;h of the world, will become common among them, and will be tolerated and allowed of: and how evident &s;oever it be, that it is contra|ry to what the word of God enjoins and re|quires; yet when it has <HI>once</HI> become common and cu&s;tomary, it will be viewed by the world as being <HI>a little thing,</HI> unworthy of notice; and that for any one to be grieved with it, or bear te&s;timony again&s;t it, is a mark of &s;uper&s;tition and &s;illy weakne&s;s. It is agreeable to the &s;pirit of the world, to practi&s;e openly many things which the great law of love does as ab&s;olutely condemn, as the third command condemns cur&s;ing and &s;wearing. And on this principle it has become fa&s;hionable and cu&s;tomary, even among&s;t tho&s;e who call them&s;elves chri&s;tians, to bite and devour one another; and they are ge|nerally as fond as the re&s;t of the world are, to make what is commonly called <HI>good bargains,</HI>
<PB N="61" REF="044516_0060_101E0EDCB41B6E88">
in their dealings with one another; and they will hear a chri&s;tian brother &s;peak evil of ano|ther, without bearing their te&s;timony again&s;t &s;uch conduct. They have learnt to violate their engagements to each other, and to pay no re|gard to the mutual promi&s;es whereby they have bound them&s;elves to each other, but only &s;o far forth as the authority of the civil law will bind them to a fulfilment of their bonds: and if they can avail them&s;elves of any &s;lip in the law, to get rid of their engagements, it is not <HI>much</HI> out of character for them to do it. And whil&s;t profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians have learnt to prac|ti&s;e after this manner, I am &s;ure they have learnt it not from the precepts of Chri&s;t, but from the example of the world. The&s;e things are agreeable to the reli&s;h &amp; &s;pirit of the world, and have therefore become common and cu&s;|tomary among them; and they are <HI>little things,</HI> not worthy of notice; and it would be a pity for profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians to be &s;o <HI>&s;uper&s;titious</HI> as to condemn <HI>&s;uch</HI> conduct in one another, or to be grieved when there is nothing more to be &s;een than &s;uch <HI>little things</HI> as the&s;e.

more incon&s;i&s;tent with the whole de&s;ign of the civil law, than the indulgence of &s;uch prac|tices is incon&s;i&s;tent with the plain meaning of the great law of love.

For whil&s;t they profe&s;s to lament that abu&s;e with which they have treated their king, and to acknowledge, with &s;hame, that they have ju&s;tly provoked him to anger by treating the laws of his kingdom with contempt; and at the &s;ame time mean to repeat over the <HI>&s;ame abu&s;e,</HI> and to per&s;i&s;t in treating the laws of his king|dom with the <HI>&s;ame contempt;</HI> is there any thing in <HI>&s;uch prayers</HI> but the mo&s;t daring in&s;ult, and open hypocri&s;y? Whil&s;t they can treat the Al|mighty in &s;uch a manner as this, and have any hope or expectation that he will be plea&s;ed with them, or look upon it that there is any &s;ince|rity in their mo&s;t &s;olemn addre&s;&s;es to him; they mu&s;t &s;urely conceive of him, not only as being <HI>altogether &s;uch a one as them&s;elves,</HI> but that it is a much ea&s;ier matter to impo&s;e upon him, and to make a fool of him, than it is to impo&s;e up|on one of their fellow mortals. Let &s;uch a people be ever &s;o devout in attending to the external duties of religion, and let them go up

<P>AND without putting into practice tho&s;e things which Chri&s;t has &s;aid, to what purpo&s;e can it be for the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t to hold up the truth, and to urge the importance of it by all the arguments that are weighty and &s;olemn, with any view or expectation that it will produce any effectual conviction in the minds of peri&s;hing &s;inners? It ca&s;ts off the pro&s;pect of this, not only as it provokes God to withhold his &s;pi|rit; but al&s;o as the direct tendency of it is to prevent any light from entering into their minds from the mo&s;t plain, pungent, and powerful preaching. Let the truth be held up in the cleare&s;t light and let the im|portance of it be urged by every con&s;ideration that is weighty and &s;olemn; yet if the truth is contradicted by the open and vi&s;ible practice of tho&s;e who profe&s;s to be of the truth, and they &s;uffer one another to go right abrea&s;t of the whole &s;pirit and evident meaning of their covenant vows; this will effectually put out &amp; prevent all the light that would otherwi&s;e ari&s;e in the minds of &s;inners from the di&s;pen&s;ation of the truth. Mankind will always form their apprehen&s;ions of the nature and importance of religion by what they &s;ee in the lives of its profe&s;&s;ors. If they &s;ee that tho&s;e who make a profe&s;&s;ion, do treat the things of religion in their daily practice, and the &s;olemn truths which they hear from &s;abbath to &s;abbath, as being of the mo&s;t &s;a|cred importance, and are governed in their daily walk, by a &s;acred regard to them; this &s;ight will force upon them a conviction which they can hardly re&s;i&s;t, that the truth which they have heard, is as important as it was pretended to be. And if on the other hand, they &s;ee tho&s;e who make a profe&s;&s;ion, trifling with the mo&s;t &s;olemn truths in their daily practice, and con|ducting
<PB N="67" REF="044516_0066_101E0EF0AF64D3E8">
as though they believed not the things which they have heard, but in their practice they are con|formed to the &s;pirit and manners of the world, and they &s;uffer one another to go directly abrea&s;t of the whole tenor of their covenant vows; there is nothing in the univer&s;e that can be more fatal to put out all the light that the truth would otherwi&s;e convey to their minds; and there is nothing that can, with more cer|tainty, make fa&s;t the bonds of death upon them. It is the mo&s;t effectual way to <HI>&s;hut up the kingdom of heaven again&s;t men.</HI> For whil&s;t the laws of Chri&s;t's kingdom are &s;uffered to be trampled under foot by tho&s;e who are called by his name, when &s;inners are warned of their danger, a view of their danger is effectually hid from their &s;ight. They are called upon to believe that which <HI>they know</HI> that tho&s;e who profe&s;s to be of the truth, do not believe; and <HI>on this account</HI> they can hardly be per&s;uaded to think that they are called upon <HI>in earne&s;t,</HI> to attend to the things which belong to their peace; but whil&s;t they &s;ee that profe&s;&s;ors are &s;uffered to trifle with the truth in their daily practice, it mu&s;t, and it cannot but appear to them that they are trifled with when they are called upon to attend to the truth. Let the truth be proved out by arguments that are ever &s;o clear and weighty, yet whil&s;t it is trifled with, and treated at this rate by tho&s;e who profe&s;s to be of the truth, the clearne&s;s of argument will have no tendency to produce conviction, but the contrary. For the more clearly the truth is held up to view, if at the &s;ame time, it is trifled with by tho&s;e who profe&s;s to be of the truth, the more will it be de&s;pi&s;ed and di&s;gu&s;ted by tho&s;e who are called upon to attend to it: and there is nothing that can have &s;uch a tendency to pre|judice the minds and harden the hearts of mankind again&s;t the truth, as on the one hand, to hold it up to view as being of the mo&s;t &s;acred and weighty impor|tance, and on the other hand, to trifle with it in our daily practice. This one ob&s;ervation is &s;ufficient to
<PB N="68" REF="044516_0067_101E0EF24FD4EEC8">
account for that flood of dei&s;m and infidelity that &s;o awfully threatens to deluge the land. It is in vain for profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians to call upon mankind to believe that which it is evident, by their daily practice, they them&s;elves do not believe. The cleare&s;t arguments, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, will have no effect, but to di&s;gu&s;t and harden them again&s;t the truth. It will ever be in vain to hold up the truth, and to urge the importance of it by the mo&s;t weighty arguments, with any expectation that it will have any tendency to pro|duce an effectual conviction, unle&s;s, at the &s;ame time, tho&s;e who profe&s;s to be of the truth, will carry the truth into execution. And under this view of the matter, it is evident that tho&s;e corporations who call them&s;elves churches of Chri&s;t, whil&s;t they refu&s;e to put the laws of Chri&s;t's kingdom into execution, and will &s;uffer them to be trampled under foot, are more awful|ly guilty of the blood of &s;ouls than every other &s;et of men under heaven; and there is no where to be found &s;uch in&s;ult, prevarication &amp; hypocri&s;y, as has run thro' the whole of their conduct, whil&s;t they have called Chri&s;t Lord, Lord, and not done the things which he has &s;aid.</P>

<P>IF tho&s;e corporations who call them&s;elves churches of Chri&s;t, do not mean or intend to put the laws of Chri&s;t's kingdom into execution, it is evident that they are combined together for no other purpo&s;e but to make fa&s;t the bonds of death upon one another; and nothing can be more dangerous to the &s;oul of any per&s;on than to join in fellow&s;hip with &s;uch a church.

But no one can be under better advantages for this but in proportion as he is under advantages to walk in the light, to be guarded from every fal&s;e way, and directed and led in <HI>that</HI> way, and that <HI>only</HI> which the word of God directs; whatever gives him any advantage for this, is of the nature of the highe&s;t privilege on this &s;ide heaven; and whatever is of the nature of a temptation to lead him a&s;tray from the path of his duty, is mo&s;t awfully dangerous, and there is nothing which can be|hove him more &s;acredly to avoid. And whatever has a tendency, in its operation, to hide the path of duty, is &s;urely the mo&s;t effectual temptation to lead him a&s;tray from this path. And &s;urely it is hard to conceive how a per&s;on can be in a &s;ituation where he is more likely to have the path of his duty entirely hid from his eyes, than to be in fellow&s;hip with a church who do not mean or intend to put the laws of Chri&s;t's kingdom in|to execution. When they will &s;uffer one another to go directly contrary to the true &s;pirit and plain mean|ing of their covenant vows, and will plead up for and countenance tho&s;e things in the conduct of one ano|ther which the word of God does ab&s;olutely abhor, &amp; &s;olemnly condemn; they not only put out all the light that would otherwi&s;e be for the conviction of &s;inners, but it is their whole bu&s;ine&s;s to hide the path of duty from the &s;ight of each other. If any one is under bet|ter advantages to be prepared for heaven in con&s;e|quence of his joining in fellow&s;hip with a church, than he &s;hould otherwi&s;e be, it mu&s;t be becau&s;e he is under &s;ome better advantages to learn where the path of his duty is; but he can't be under better advantages to know this any further than he is taught it; &amp; he can't be taught it in a church with whom he is in fellow&s;hip but only in <HI>that &s;en&s;e</HI> in which they under&s;tand it; &amp; it is manife&s;t, that after all their profe&s;&s;ion, they under|&s;tand and teach the truth to others in <HI>that &s;en&s;e,</HI> and
<PB N="70" REF="044516_0069_101E0EF8740206A0">
that <HI>only</HI> in which they practi&s;e it. And hence if their practice be in oppo&s;iton to the true &s;en&s;e and plain meaning of the truth, it is the very &s;ame thing as if they &s;hould openly tell tho&s;e who are in fellow&s;hip with them, that <HI>this</HI> is the path which the word of God marks out for them to walk in; and &s;o far as any one gives heed to them as being of the truth, &s;o far mu&s;t he be in the mo&s;t awful danger of being perverted from the right ways of the Lord, and of being turned a&s;ide by a deceived heart. Nothing can be more dangerous to any &s;oul, than to come into the &s;ecret, and be united to the a&s;&s;embly of &s;uch a corporation; for <HI>if the &s;alt hath,</HI> in this way, <HI>lo&s;t its &s;avour,</HI> it is not only altoge|ther u&s;ele&s;s, but it has become much wor&s;e than no|thing. <HI>It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dung+hill; but men ca&s;t it out</HI> into &s;ome &s;ink, that it may not poi&s;on the land, and render it barren.</P>

<P>IF we believe the declarations of God's word, we mu&s;t give in to it, that unle&s;s the tokens of God's pre|&s;ence do accompany the admini&s;tration of his word &amp; ordinances, our attending upon the external duties of religion, will &s;erve to no other purpo&s;e but to prepare us for more aggravated ruin than if we had never heard the go&s;pel, or known our Ma&s;ter's will.

if they were left upon record for our learning, &amp; have the &s;ame reference to the vi&s;ible people of God as they had to the hou&s;e of Eli; or, in other words, if God does equally abhor the &s;ame thing at one time as he does at another time, and in one people as he does in another people; and if we may expect that he will te&s;tify his di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t his people at one time, for any particular treatment of him, in the &s;ame way that he has te&s;tified his di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t them at an|other time for the &s;ame treatment of him; that is, if God be <HI>the &s;ame ye&s;terday, to day, and forever</HI>&mdash;the&s;e words do certainly point out the rea&s;on why the tokens of God's pre&s;ence are &s;o awfully withheld from the admini&s;tration of his word and ordinances. Whil&s;t God withholds the tokens of his pre&s;ence from his vi&s;ible people, he treats them as if he did but <HI>lightly e&s;teem them.</HI> When he continues to withhold the to|kens of his pre&s;ence from the people that are called by his name, and there is no apparent effect from the ad|mini&s;tration of his word and ordinances; but on the contrary, in reference to the fruits of that temper which the go&s;pel enjoins, they are as barren as <HI>the heath in the de&s;ert,</HI> and evidently appear to be left to the infatuation and folly of their own hearts, produ|cing a &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition, mutual jealou&s;ies, &amp; evil &s;urmi&s;ings &amp; perver&s;e di&s;putings; or a fatal union &amp; peace on worldly principles; the&s;e things are the highe&s;t evidence that can be conceived of that &s;uch a people are treated by God as being <HI>lightly e&s;teemed</HI> by him.

by refu&s;ing to put them into execution. If they don't mean to put the&s;e laws into execution, it is certain they don't mean that the authority of the&s;e laws &s;hould govern them; for it is impo&s;&s;ible that any laws &s;hould govern the conduct of a people, or have any binding authority in them for &s;uch a purpo&s;e, unle&s;s they are put into execution.
