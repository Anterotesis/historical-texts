<HEAD>THE CRISIS. NUMBER II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Bloody Court, A Bloody Mini&s;try, AND A Bloody Parliament.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;udden and unexpected di&s;&s;olution of the la&s;t ruinous Parliament gave a ju&s;t and general alarm to the whole na|tion; and we may &s;earch in vain the voluminous pages of Grecian, Roman, or Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, to find &s;uch another plan of premeditated villany for de&s;troying, at one grand &s;troke of royal and mi|ni&s;terial policy, all the rights of a free people. Lord North, engendered in the womb of hell, rai&s;ed by the fo&s;tering hand of infernal &s;pirits, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing principles that have eclip&s;ed all the glo|ries of his &s;atanic parents, had the effrontery to de|clare, in the face of the Hou&s;e of Commons and the world, but a few days before the rece&s;s of the late Parliament, that they &s;hould meet again early in October for the de&s;patch of bu&s;ine&s;s. When he uttered this fal&s;ehood, it was &s;u&s;pected by many, and he well knew it had been determined, that they &s;hould be di&s;&s;olved, although the preci&s;e time was
<PB N="10" REF="013908_0002_0F9257C6F95A05A8">not fixed. On the 16th day of September, 1774, a notice was publi&s;hed in the Gazette for the la&s;t Parliament to meet on the 15th of November; eleven days had not elap&s;ed before a proclama|tion appeared for its di&s;&s;olution, and the calling a new Parliament. Who can guard again&s;t decep|tion, artifice and villany, when &s;tamped with royal authority? The very thought of an hone&s;t Hou&s;e of Commons &s;truck terror into the guilty &s;oul of Lord North, the diabolical minion of royal fa|vour, and in&s;trument of royal vengeance; nay, even the King (virtuous as he is) had his fears; and in order to &s;ecure their own creatures and de|pendents, or, in other words, to have the old Par|liament new revived, and &s;muggle a majority of venal abandoned mi&s;creants (who would deny their God, or &s;ell their &s;ouls for money) into the pre&s;ent Hou&s;e of Commons, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ord North &s;ent let|ters to all his friends that they might be prepared, and it was known in the mo&s;t di&s;tant parts of Eng|land, and even the time of the election fixed in &s;e|veral boroughs in Cornwall &s;ome days before the Parliament was di&s;&s;olved. This is a truth which Lord North, with all his con&s;ummate impudence, cannot deny.</P>
<P>The mini&s;terial hacks were immediately &s;et to work to fabricate lies (and publi&s;h them in the news papers) to delude and deceive the electors; that little or no oppo&s;ition might be made to the tools of government. One report &s;aid the di&s;&s;olu|tion of Parliament was owing to &s;ome di&s;agreeable advices from America, and that our virtuous King, with his &s;till more virtuous mini&s;ters, intended to adopt &s;ome conciliating mea&s;ures with re&s;pect to the colonies, and that it would betray a weakne&s;s
<PB N="11" REF="013908_0003_0F9257C8941A7048">in the King to let the &s;ame Parliament meet again, to repeal tho&s;e acts which they had but a few months before pa&s;&s;ed. Another report, equally true, a&s;&s;erted it was on account of intelligence re|ceived from the north of a very alarming nature; and a third, that it was occa&s;ioned by a difference between the French and Engli&s;h mini&s;try, which rendered &s;uch a &s;tep nece&s;&s;ary, as there was great rea&s;on to believe we &s;hould &s;oon be involved in a war, and that it would be exceedingly improper to have the nation put in a ferment, by a general elec|tion, at &s;o critical a time as that, and when the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of Parliament would be particularly want|ed. A fourth report was, that Lord Chatham and his friends would be immediately taken into favour, and that there was to be an entire change in the mini&s;try. By the&s;e low artifices and mini|&s;terial lies, the people of England were lulled into a &s;tate of &s;upinene&s;s, and even made to lend a helping hand to complete their own ruin.</P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;equent part of this paper &s;hall unravel the diabolical &s;cheme. Lord North &s;aw a powerful oppo&s;ition forming in every part of England; he was fearful of a&s;&s;ociations; he dreaded a &s;olemn league and covenant, which he was certain the people would have entered into for the pre&s;erva|tion of their rights and liberties before next May, the time when the Parliament would have been di&s;|&s;olved of cour&s;e; he trembled for the event; con|&s;cious of his own villany, and that his head had been long forfeited to the ju&s;tice of his country, he determined to take the electors by &s;urpri&s;e, to put them off their guard, and rob them of time; that no oppo&s;ition might be made to his creatures, and the people be prevented from fixing upon men
<PB N="12" REF="013908_0004_0F9257C906EC6A48">of hone&s;t independent principles, to whom they might with &s;afety delegate the important, the &s;a|cred tru&s;t of repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>Lord North communicated his fears to the King, painted the daring rebellious &s;pirit of the Ameri|cans, and told him, that the people here were as di&s;loyal and di&s;affected, and that hints had been thrown out in the public prints, of plans forming in different parts of England, for keeping out of the new Parliament mo&s;t of his friends; and unle&s;s prevented, by &s;ome well concerted &s;cheme, there was but too much rea&s;on to believe, from the &s;pirit of the people, that they would &s;ucceed; an event, &s;ays this traitor, much feared and greatly dreaded by every well wi&s;her to your per&s;on and govern|ment: Should it ever take place, as there is a country party, or a majority of mock patriots in the Hou&s;e of Commons, who are enemies to all or|der and government, you mu&s;t be reduced to a mo&s;t degrading &s;ituation indeed; your pre&s;ent friends will then be unable to give you any a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance; and in&s;tead of the power being in your hands, it will then be in the hands of the people; and you will be under the di&s;graceful nece&s;&s;ity of giving your a&s;&s;ent to the repeal of every act which has been lately pa&s;&s;ed for the purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing a revenue, and enforcing a due obedience to your au|thority: In &s;hort, you will be a King without power, and &s;ubject to the controul of a few de|magogues for liberty, the dregs of mankind, and a common rabble, who will always &s;upport them; nay, it may even endanger the &s;ecurity of your throne, for what will not a hot headed Parliament do, with whom the voice of the people can have any weight? The plan for reducing the Americans,
<PB N="13" REF="013908_0005_0F9257C9C00130B0">and making them dependent on your will, mu&s;t be cru&s;hed; they will triumph in the victory obtained over the ju&s;t power of Parliament and your prero|gative; your faithful &s;ervants will be compelled to leave you, and you will be without a real friend to advi&s;e with. If your Maje&s;ty can get a majority of your friends recho&s;en in the new Par|liament, you will be able to rai&s;e what money you plea&s;e with their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; you will then be able to keep your pre&s;ent Mini&s;ters, and pre&s;erve them from the re&s;entment (which has been incurred by &s;erving of you) of an enraged rabble, who are made to believe, through the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the pre&s;s, that they labour under a load of accumulated grievances; you will then be able to trample un|der foot, faction, &s;edition, and rebellion through|out your dominions, and to carry every thing be|fore you, agreeable to your royal plea&s;ure; with the power of Parliament, and your Maje&s;ty's firm|ne&s;s and per&s;everance, you may bring England and America into a proper &s;tate of &s;ubjection to your will. To accompli&s;h this it will be nece&s;&s;ary to prorogue the Parliament to &s;ome future day, then to meet, and immediately after call a council and di&s;&s;olve them; in the mean time your friends may be made acquainted with this determination, and be prepared for the election before any oppo|&s;ition can po&s;&s;ibly be made, or the people know any thing of the matter.</P>
<P>The King, firmly re&s;olved on the people's ruin, care&s;&s;ed his villanous minion, admired the plan formed for our de&s;truction; and, drunk with pre|rogative, &s;ucked in the baneful advice and pur|&s;ued it.</P>
<P>Thus the pre&s;ent Parliament was &s;muggled, and thus, in a mo&s;t &s;hameful, unprecedented, artful, and
<PB N="14" REF="013908_0006_0F9257CA8D13E680">&s;udden manner, was the la&s;t Hou&s;e of Commons di&s;&s;olved by the King, to an&s;wer his own and his mini&s;ter's wicked, tyrannical, and bloody de&s;igns again&s;t the people and con&s;titution of this king|dom. Such an in&s;tance, of an infamous exertion of the royal prerogative, and under the like cir|cum&s;tances, is not to be found in the hi&s;tory of England; &s;uch an injury and in&s;ult was never be|fore offered to a free people, and never ought to be forgiven. It was a piece of Hanoverian trea|chery, ba&s;ene&s;s, and ingratitude, which has far ex|ceeded all the artful villany and low cunning of the di&s;carded Stuarts. His Maje&s;ty (heaven pro|tect &s;o much goodne&s;s) out of a tenderne&s;s to the con&s;titution, could not make &s;o bad a u&s;e of his prerogative, five years back, as to di&s;&s;olve the &s;ame Parliament, when their iniquitous proceedings, and their violations of ju&s;tice, had rou&s;ed the indigna|tion of the people, and he was reque&s;ted to do it by upwards of eighty thou&s;and freeholders (&s;igned) and the general voice of the whole nation; but in 1774 he got the better of that tenderne&s;s, and, to an&s;wer his own purpo&s;es, could exert the royal pre|rogative (which he had ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to his &s;ubjects, in the haughty terms of a de&s;pot) with no other view, but to overturn the con&s;titution of the Briti&s;h empire in England and America, and de&s;troy or en&s;lave the people.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty, his minions, and in&s;truments of &s;laughter, are now &s;afe in robbing the people of their property, by &s;hameful and iniquitous taxes in time of peace; &s;afe in their &s;ubver&s;ion of the Prote&s;tant religion; &s;afe and &s;ucce&s;sful in their cruel plan for &s;tarving the hone&s;t and indu&s;trious inhabitants, and de&s;troying the trade of the town
<PB N="15" REF="013908_0007_0F9257CB4B397190">of Bo&s;ton in America, and the commerce of Eng|land; &s;afe &s;o far in their attempt to de&s;troy the lives, rights, liberties, and privileges of millions; I &s;ay they are &s;afe, in all the&s;e violations of, and depredations on, our national &s;ecurity, and natural rights, becau&s;e we are tame.</P>
<LG>
<L>The&s;e mighty crimes will &s;ure, ere long, provoke</L>
<L>The arm of Britain to &s;ome noble &s;troke.</L>
<L>No wonder if &s;uch deeds &s;hould &s;oon compel</L>
<L>America and England to rebel;</L>
<L>Then George may boa&s;t, that he, by art and hire,</L>
<L>Great Nero like, has &s;et the world on fire;</L>
<L>Might boa&s;t that thou&s;ands by his power fell,</L>
<L>And that he could even Nero far excel;</L>
<L>Bute &s;hall rejoice, and in&s;tantly re&s;tore</L>
<L>The Stuart race in all their cur&s;ed pow'r;</L>
<L>Shall &s;eize upon the throne he &s;hould defend,</L>
<L>And traitor prove when George mo&s;t wants a friend.</L>
<L>This may not be; but &s;hould he &s;till oppre&s;s</L>
<L>His injured &s;ubjects, &s;ure they'll &s;eek redre&s;s,</L>
<L>When, by oppre&s;&s;ion, driven to de&s;pair,</L>
<L>If he don't love them, they may make him fear;</L>
<L>And though, by &s;hameful taxes, he has &s;eiz'd</L>
<L>Their trea&s;ure, and their very vitals &s;queez'd,</L>
<L>Yet he &s;hould know, that &s;words and arms remain,</L>
<L>When call'd by wrongs, are &s;eldom us'd in vain;</L>
<L>And freedom's &s;ons, with liberty in&s;pir'd,</L>
<L>With mighty rage and indignation fir'd,</L>
<L>'Ggain&s;t England's mortal foes no longer yield</L>
<L>To lawle&s;s power arm'd with virtue's &s;hield;</L>
<L>Their cau&s;e mo&s;t ju&s;t, nay Heaven's &s;acred cau&s;e,</L>
<L>The cau&s;e of truth and violated laws,</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="013908_0008_0F9257CC0263F428">
Will draw th' avenging &s;word, O glorious deed!</L>
<L>Their laws to &s;ave, and make tho&s;e traitors bleed;</L>
<L>Aided by Heav'n all danger will defy,</L>
<L>And nobly conquer, or like Britons die;</L>
<L>Then, ble&s;&s;ing freedom with their parting breath,</L>
<L>Will bravely fall into the arms of death</L>
<L>A glorious death, much better in the grave,</L>
<L>A freeman buried than a living &s;lave.</L>
<L>'Twas fir&s;t decreed, by that great pow'r above.</L>
<L>All &s;hould be free, and Heav'n gave in love</L>
<L>That ble&s;&s;ing to mankind, a &s;acred tru&s;t,</L>
<L>He who'd re&s;ign it, is to God unju&s;t.</L>
