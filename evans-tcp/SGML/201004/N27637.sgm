<HEAD>Hi&s;tory of ELIZABETH ANDREWS.</HEAD>
<P>SHE was born, June 28th, 1767, in the town of <HI>We&s;t-Stockbridge,</HI> (Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts,) of reputa|ble parents. Her father, Mr. LAMBERT BURG|HARDT, was of Dutch extract, and an early &s;ettler in the town. ELIZABETH was his fourth child, and the elde&s;t of five daughters, being the fir&s;t per&s;on born in the place. The country being new, &s;he had few or no advantages of educa|tion. This di&s;advantage was, however, in a great mea&s;ure remedied by her diligent application, after &s;he came to years of under&s;tanding. When about nine years of age, &s;he was deprived of her mother, after which &s;he payed con&s;tant attention to her younger &s;i&s;ters.&mdash;Her father, however, marrying again, after awhile, &s;he was in a great mea&s;ure re|lieved from this burthen. At a &s;uitable age, &s;he went as an apprentice to the Tayloring bu&s;ine&s;s, in which &s;he made a very decent proficiency. Her occupation calling her abroad, &s;he thereby formed a more general acquaintance with the world, which, joined with a frank and generous di&s;po&s;ition, ren|dered her an agreeable member of &s;ociety. She was remarked likewi&s;e for indu&s;try, prudence and economy. Naturally agreeable in her per&s;on, &s;he
<PB N="4" REF="036837_0003_100B1D2912326E98">was equally mode&s;t in her deportment and re&s;erved in her behavior.</P>
<P>IT will not be improper here, to &s;ay &s;omething of her moral character.&mdash;Her natural temper was ha&s;ty and violent, but &s;he had &s;o far cultivated it as to appear almo&s;t uniformly of a mild and ea&s;y di&s;po&s;ition. She had a heart to feel for the di&s;|tre&s;&s;es of others, though ready to re&s;ent any injury offered her. She was a &s;trict ob&s;erver of the &s;ab|bath and its &s;acred in&s;titutions; and on the&s;e out|ward moral duties, &s;he re&s;ted her hopes of future happine&s;s, tho' at times &s;he appeared not fully &s;at|isfied with her &s;ituation. She, at times reflected on eternal things, and in conver&s;ation, with a &s;i&s;|ter of mine, was heard to &s;ay that &s;he wi&s;hed &s;he was a Chri&s;tian, as &s;he believed they enjoyed them|&s;elves better than any other people.</P>
<P>IN the year 1791, &s;he became my companion. She remained this year, in an ea&s;y, unconcerned &s;tate, during which, we had a child be&s;towed on us, which &s;he con&s;idered as a very great ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>SOME time in Autumn, 1792, Mr. OLIVER AYER, then a candidate in the mini&s;try, was em|ployed to preach among us on probation. He tarried through the winter, in the cour&s;e of which he made us &s;everal vi&s;its. Di&s;cour&s;ing frequently with my wife, he endeavored to convince her of the importance of true religion, and of being pre|pared for death. He further ob&s;erved, that it would be indeed de&s;irable, if &s;he and her &s;i&s;ters &s;hould &s;o live in this world, as hereafter to meet, and be happy together in Heaven.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This ob&s;ervation originated from &s;ome conver&s;ation re&s;pecting a &s;i&s;ter of hers, who had lately become hopefully converted to the truth.</NOTE> She was
<PB N="5" REF="036837_0004_100B1D2C59DB33A0">deeply affected with his di&s;cour&s;e, and began to view her &s;ituation as truly dangerous. The re|peated and weighty arguments which he brought to enforce the duty of repentance, had thoroughly &s;mitten her heart. Her conviction at length, however, turned to a &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition and envy. She was greatly oppo&s;ed to the way of &s;alvation as it is pointed out in the Go&s;pel. Her heart ro&s;e again&s;t the doctrine of total depravity. She could not endure the idea that the creature can do noth|ing meritorious. In the heighth of her oppo&s;ition, &s;he was even led to regard revelation, it&s;elf, as a mere human invention.</P>
<P>SHE thus continued her oppo&s;ition till the latter end of May 1793, when Mr. AYER was ordained to the pa&s;toral charge of the Church and congrega|tion in this place. He &s;oon after came to board with us, by which means he had opportunity of frequently conver&s;ing with her on the important doctrines of &s;alvation. He labored a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly to convince her of the propriety of the Go&s;pel-plan of redemption by a mediator, and of the divine &s;ov|ereignty.&mdash;He told her that unle&s;s &s;he was brought to view things in a very different light, &s;he would mo&s;t certainly be damned. She pa&s;&s;ionately re|plied, &s;he did not care if &s;he was. He then told her, that he feared tho&s;e very words would &s;eal her de&s;truction. She appeared greatly agitated&mdash;bur&s;t into tears, ro&s;e up, and left the room. Struck with her ra&s;h and daring reply, he avoided &s;aying any thing further to her on the &s;ubject. But, &s;he find|ing he had given her over, began to &s;ear that God would do likewi&s;e&mdash;She would frequently open a
<PB N="6" REF="036837_0005_100B1D2E87B66168">door for conver&s;ation, by a&s;king him &s;ome que&s;|tions&mdash;but he cautiou&s;ly avoided giving her any direct an&s;wer. This gave her &s;till greater unea&s;i|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>OUR Rev. Pa&s;tor being occa&s;ionally vi&s;ited by the neighboring mini&s;ters, they would frequently direct their di&s;cour&s;e to her, propo&s;ing &s;ome im|portant que&s;tion. She would immediately attack them on the doctrine of divine &s;overeignty, and hold up the incon&s;i&s;tency of their preaching "that the creature can do nothing of him&s;elf, and that he would neverthele&s;s be damned, if he &s;hould neg|lect his &s;alvation." The Rev. Mr. C&mdash;was one with whom &s;he contended, with the greate&s;t engagedne&s;s. He pointed out the danger of her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and &s;hewed her that while &s;he continued to oppo&s;e God's law and government, &s;he was at enmity with him, and con&s;equently He was an enemy to her. He told her that God had threatened to pour out his wrath upon his enemies and to execute his vengeance on them that know Him not. She, however, di&s;regarded all the&s;e pi|ous admonitions, and her heart continued to &s;well with the mo&s;t violent and increa&s;ing oppo&s;ition. She remained in this frame of mind until towards the clo&s;e of the year, when her health began to de|cline, and a &s;ettled melancholy gradually &s;ucceeded. That &s;tate of mind was followed by its natural con&s;equences: &s;he would frequently ob&s;erve, that &s;he had not long to continue in this world; that &s;he was &s;trongly per&s;uaded death would &s;oon enter her family, and that in all probability &s;he was to be the victim. Having realized the lo&s;s of a kind pa|rent
<PB N="7" REF="036837_0006_100B1D300DFD67D8">in her tender years, &s;he expre&s;&s;ed great con|cern and anxiety for her little daughter, who, &s;he imagined was about to be bereaved of her mother. Although &s;he kept about her daily bu&s;ine&s;s, yet &s;he declined fa&s;t; her mind was &s;till gloomy, her nights were re&s;tle&s;s, and her &s;leep was di&s;turbed with di&s;mal and terrific apprehen&s;ions. I endeav|ored to expel the cloud that hung over her mind, by telling her that her apprehen&s;ions were all to be attributed to her indi&s;po&s;ition of body, and a too great depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits, but I argued in vain; &s;he per&s;i&s;ted in the belief that her end was ap|proaching, and her fears were fully confirmed by an in&s;tance of mortality which happened in our neighborhood. About the fir&s;t of January, 1794, Mrs. R&mdash; a di&s;tant relation of hers, died. She attended the funeral of the decea&s;ed, was greatly affected, con&s;idered it as a &s;pecial warning, and ap|peared to realize more &s;en&s;ibly than ever the ter|rors of the la&s;t enemy. Her repo&s;e was now di&s;|turbed with &s;till more awful apprehen&s;ions. She would frequently relate to me her dreams, and never failed to draw from them, &s;ome ominous and unfavorable conclu&s;ion. The peculiar circum|&s;tances that attended her, had probably no &s;mall influence on her mind, as &s;he frequently ob&s;erved, that &s;he &s;hould not &s;urvive her approaching &s;ick|ne&s;s. On the 26th of the &s;ame month (January) however, &s;he was brought to bed, and &s;urvived. During the few fir&s;t days &s;he was comfortable; but was &s;oon after &s;eized with violent and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing pains, which kept her very weak and low for about a fortnight; after which, &s;he began again to recov|er,
<PB N="8" REF="036837_0007_100B1D31C41CB430">and in a &s;hort time became able to walk about the hou&s;e. Her melancholy, notwith&s;tanding, &s;till continued. She could not per&s;uade her&s;elf but that &s;ome great and awful event awaited her. Not long after, &s;he perceived a weakne&s;s to affect the two fore-fingers of her right hand, which, however trifling at fir&s;t, &s;oon rendered her hand wholly u&s;ele&s;s. This alarmed her and increa&s;ed her fears. One day at the du&s;k of evening as &s;he lay on the bed immer&s;ed in gloomy apprehen&s;ions, &s;he appeared to have lively views of God's wrath. She thought he was then preparing his thunder to de&s;troy her&mdash;&s;he ro&s;e ha&s;tily, came ru&s;hing forward to the fire where we were &s;itting, and &s;at down with us, as if to avoid the impending &s;troke. But He, from who&s;e pre&s;ence none can fly; &s;till pur&s;ued her, and &s;truck her into a fit. She &s;hrieked out and fainted. We called a phy&s;ician, who at fir&s;t view, intimated that he thought her dying&mdash;he, however, gave a medicine which had the de&s;ired effect.&mdash;She in a &s;hort time revived and expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf thus; "Oh! mu&s;t I die, and go to hell? how can I bear the torments of hell? how can I en|dure eternal burnings." And with &s;uch like ex|pre&s;&s;ions &s;he continued through the night, without one moments &s;leep, tho' as &s;he afterwards told us, &s;he felt di&s;po&s;ed for it, but feared, if &s;he &s;lept, &s;he &s;hould wake in hell. This &s;hock removed the di&s;order as far up as her &s;houlder, and left her arm entirely u&s;ele&s;s. She remained in a bewildered &s;tate, the whole of the &s;ucceeding day, and com|plained that her mind was much confu&s;ed. Night came on, and &s;he, being weary and nearly exhau&s;t|ed,
<PB N="9" REF="036837_0008_100B1D33F10BCD28">(having a high burning fever,) fell a&s;leep and well until morning and felt her&s;elf greatly refre&s;hed.</P>
<P>THIS day (being the Sabbath, Feb. 16th) was a day of re&s;t to her troubled &s;oul. A day in which God was plea&s;ed, wonderfully to di&s;play his power and mercy in recovering to him&s;elf one of his &s;inful, de&s;pairing creatures. When &s;he awoke her mind appeared calm and compo&s;ed, but her fears &s;oon returned with renewed weight. Her convictions were very powerful; &s;he appeared to have lively views of God's righteous indignation, directed again&s;t her. She pre&s;ented a truly affecting &s;pec|tacle, exclaiming that "God had turned his face from her, and would not hear her prayers."&mdash; On being a&s;ked if our mini&s;ter &s;hould intercede for her, publicly, at the throne of grace; &s;he replied, "it will be all in vain, it will do no good;" but did not object. When the divine &s;ervice of the day was ended, a con&s;iderable number of people croud|ed in to &s;ee her, as her &s;ingular ca&s;e had excited univer&s;al attention. It was told her, that an ex|traordinary petition had been put up for her, &s;he &s;aid, "it would avail nothing, for God would not have mercy on &s;o vile a wretch as &s;he was, and al|tho' her heart was violently oppo&s;ed to his &s;over|eignty, yet &s;he was ready to acknowledge his ju&s;tice in condemning her." She was in great agony thro' mo&s;t of the day, writhing her body, and di&s;cover|ing the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible emotions of angui&s;h. We could &s;ay nothing that would alleviate or comfort her. The &s;cripture promi&s;es, which we repeated to her, &s;erved only to heighten the &s;en&s;e of her
<PB N="10" REF="036837_0009_100B1D37365948C8">guilt and increa&s;e her terror. On this occa&s;ion we called a new phy&s;ician to coun&s;el and advi&s;e with our former one. But neither of them could ad|mini&s;ter any thing to her relief. Her di&s;order lay beyond their reach. Our new phy&s;ician, being a &s;erious and candid man, endeavored to comfort her. He held up to her the ju&s;tice and mercy of God, and the infinite merits of the divine Media|tor. He prudently warned her again&s;t giving way to the &s;ugge&s;tions of a di&s;ordered imagination, the effects of which, he ob&s;erved, might prove fatal, by turowing her into a delirium. On being told there was yet a pro&s;pect of her recovery, the rephed, &s;he did not wi&s;h to be re&s;tored to health with the &s;ame wicked di&s;po&s;ition which &s;he then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould ruin her family, enhance her guilt, and aggravate her condemnation.</P>
<P>ONE of her &s;i&s;ters, (a profe&s;&s;or of religion, before mentioned) being pre&s;ent, &s;he cried out "dear Si&s;|ter do pray for me for God will not hear my pray|ers." She remained in this condition till towards night. I had occa&s;ion for being ab&s;ent a &s;hort time, and when I returned I &s;ound a very &s;en&s;ible alteration in her. She was cheerful; a tranquil joy appeared in her countenance. On my coming to the bed-&s;ide, &s;he addre&s;&s;ed me thus&mdash;"Are you willing to part with me? I am now willing to part with you and my dear children and all the enjoy|ments of this world, for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, who, I hope, has redeemed my &s;oul." The peace and joy which &s;he felt, &s;he was unable to expre&s;s. At the &s;ame time rather doubting the reality of what &s;he experienced, as being from God; "Oh," &s;aid &s;he,
<PB N="11" REF="036837_0010_100B1D38C1B4F360">"how is it po&s;&s;ible that &s;uch a vile wretch as I &s;hould become a &s;ubject of God's grace and favor!" A great change, &s;he found, had been wrought in her mind, tho' &s;he knew not how it was effected; it appeared as &s;omething wonderful, of which &s;he could give no account. She &s;aid, &s;he had been &s;eeking her own de&s;truction, as &s;he had been actu|ated wholly by &s;elfi&s;h motives; but that God had joyfully di&s;appointed her. She expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf mo&s;t feelingly of the divine mercy and conde&s;cen|&s;ion of God, in interpo&s;ing with his Almighty power to re&s;cue her &s;inking mind from de&s;pair, and her &s;oul from eternal ruin. And indeed, it was a mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing di&s;play of divine mercy. She ex|pre&s;&s;ed her wonder that God had not withdrawn his mercy and utterly ca&s;t her off. Her heart and voice were con&s;tantly in the mo&s;t lively exerci&s;es of gratitude, which &s;he continued thro' the day and evening, until &s;he was nearly exhau&s;ted. Her countenance which had been &s;o lately di&s;torted with pain and angui&s;h, had become &s;erene and placid. Her tempe&s;tuous mind was now calm and cheerful, and it was with difficulty that we prevailed on her to take a little repo&s;e, which &s;he &s;o much needed. During the remainder of the night, &s;he re&s;ted comfortably, and &s;pent the next day in the mo&s;t lively and joyful exerci&s;es.</P>
<P>SHE now began to reflect with &s;orrow and deep contrition on her pa&s;t life, and acknowledged in pre&s;ence of Mr. AYER and others, her folly in &s;o ra&s;hly and wickedly oppo&s;ing the doctrine of God's &s;overeignty and the depravity of his creatures. She wondered that God had not taken her at her
<PB N="12" REF="036837_0011_100B1D3BCF4F0588">word and &s;ent her immediately to de&s;truction. She de&s;ired that her confe&s;&s;ion might be drawn up and &s;ent to the Rev. Mr. C&mdash;to expre&s;s her grief and contrition for her former ra&s;h di&s;cour&s;e to him; to a&s;k his forgivene&s;s and prayers.</P>
<P>(TUESDAY morning, Feb. 18th) I awoke and found her awake al&s;o. I a&s;ked her if &s;he had re&s;t|ed comfortably? She an&s;wered, "I have not&mdash;for the Devil has been lurking about me all night to di&s;turb my peace&mdash;but I de&s;pi&s;e him for his mean|ne&s;s. I wonder that any one will have any thing to do with &s;o mean a fellow." She now found &s;he had to re&s;i&s;t the attacks of the Arch enemy; but through Divine aid, &s;he was enabled to with&s;tand his power.</P>
<P>SHE now gave an account of the exerci&s;es of her mind, previous to her being &s;truck into a fit, as before related, which was as follows: "Whil&s;t on the bed, in the du&s;k of the evening I &s;aw, to appearance, the Almighty God directly over where I lay, clothed in maje&s;ty and a flaming counte|nance. He &s;eemed to be very angry at me, and ready to thunder out a mixture of his wrath and fiery indignation upon me; and I, being &s;tartled, with &s;urpri&s;e and horror at the awful appearance, in&s;tantly ro&s;e and fled to the fire, and fat with the family to avoid the danger. But imagining my|&s;elf pur&s;ued, and finding no way of e&s;cape, my &s;pirits &s;unk within me and my nature &s;eemed to die." After thus minutely relating the above, &s;he gave &s;ome account of the la&s;t &s;truggles of her mind before &s;he received comfort, which was as follows; "when," &s;aid &s;he, "I had exerci&s;ed my&s;elf in every
<PB N="13" REF="036837_0012_100B1D3E89748070">way I could devi&s;e to make God take &s;ome notice of, and &s;how me mercy, but finding all my efforts vain, and to no purpo&s;e, I thought that &s;entence was already pa&s;&s;ed on me, and no reprieve was to be had, but that I mu&s;t go to immediate de&s;truc|tion. My heart then ro&s;e to a &s;pirit of malice again&s;t God and his authority, and &s;ince hell was to be my portion I was determined to go with a &s;tout heart. I therefore &s;et about fortifying my|&s;elf with re&s;olution, I thought I could bear the torments of hell as well as others, and expected &s;oon to join the helli&s;h crew. I al&s;o felt great bit|terne&s;s again&s;t tho&s;e who were reputed Chri&s;tians, and even the pre&s;ence of my &s;i&s;ter C&mdash;(who profe&s;&s;ed religion) was highly offen&s;ive to me.</P>
<P>IN the mid&s;t of the&s;e exerci&s;es, when I thought my&s;elf prepared to go to de&s;truction, a thought &s;truck me that I could not endure the pre&s;ence of God; me-thought I could abide the pre&s;ence of all the damn|ed race, could I but fly the face of Him, I had &s;o highly offended. The &s;hame I thought I mu&s;t feel in reflecting that God would be knowing to my frailties and weakne&s;s, operated &s;o upon my proud heart, as at once to fru&s;trate all my purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>WEARY and &s;unk almo&s;t in de&s;pair, I re&s;olved to make one more &s;truggle to obtain Heaven, as if by violence, though in direct oppo&s;ition to God, when He was plea&s;ed to interpo&s;e and bow my &s;tubborn will. I became nothing, and le&s;s than nothing, and He was plea&s;ed to pour the light of His countenance into my benighted &s;oul. Oh! who would not take &s;hame and reproach to them|&s;elves, and lie low in the du&s;t, and &s;et up God as
<PB N="14" REF="036837_0013_100B1D40ABDB7290">the &s;upreme object of love and adoration in their hearts." Thus &s;he fini&s;hed her relation. Her phy&s;icians again met in coun&s;el, and &s;poke favora|bly of her di&s;order. They ordered &s;trict attention to be paid to her hand and arm, which appeared in danger of peri&s;hing. But &s;he &s;eemed to have little concern about her natural body; &s;he &s;aid that her lame hand would do her turn as well as the other in a &s;hort time, and added &s;he cho&s;e rather her right hand &s;hould forget its cunning workman&s;hip than &s;he &s;hould forget her God and Redeemer. Her mind was now filled both night and day with the mo&s;t lively exerci&s;es. She con|templated with great plea&s;ure the wonders of re|deeming love, and the marvellous conde&s;cen&s;ion of a Saviour, in coming into the world to re&s;cue per|i&s;hing &s;inners from de&s;truction. In&s;tead of being di&s;turbed in her &s;leep as formerly, her mind was filled with the mo&s;t plea&s;ant and agreeable pro&s;|pects. The&s;e exerci&s;es, which &s;he frequently rela|ted, exhibited a &s;urpri&s;ing contra&s;t with her form|er gloomy and de&s;ponding &s;tate.</P>
<P>ONE morning after re&s;ting quietly &s;he awoke with joy in her countenance, and immediately re|lated what had pa&s;&s;ed in her mind, when a&s;leep. She &s;aid &s;he had had an interview with her decea&s;ed neighbor Mrs. R&mdash; (who has been before men|tioned, in this relation) that &s;he appeared to her in a gho&s;tly form, in a beautiful carriage, all glittering with gold, and &s;aid &s;he had come for her; that &s;he Mrs. R&mdash;took her by the hand and aided her into the carriage, which appeared to be drawn by an invi&s;ible hand: that they &s;lew with the
<PB N="15" REF="036837_0014_100B1D4232F73DC0">greate&s;t &s;wiftne&s;s thro' the fields of Ether, fur round|ed with cele&s;tial brightne&s;s, and entertained with melodious mu&s;ick and the mo&s;t ravi&s;hing conver|&s;ation from her friend, re&s;pecting the glories and beauties of the country to which they were going; and while they were thus flying, as &s;he thought to the regions of felicity, her companion &s;uddenly di&s;|appeared, leaving her alone, and a &s;tranger to the way, at which &s;he &s;uddenly awoke. The interpre|tation which &s;he gave of this dream, was, that &s;he &s;hould not long continue in this world; &s;uch an event, however, &s;he ob&s;erved, was what &s;he had ev|ery rea&s;on to expect, from the di&s;order that attend|ed her. She now appeared to decline rapidly, and for the mo&s;t part was confined to the bed. The thoughts of death were con&s;tantly in her mind, and &s;he &s;carcely &s;poke of her&s;elf, but &s;he mention|ed &s;omething of the &s;olemn and intere&s;ting &s;cene of dying, which, as it re&s;pected her, &s;he viewed to be near.</P>
<P>ABOUT this time &s;he de&s;ired that a letter might be written in her name, to my mother in Connecti|cut, and dictated the two following &s;entences; "When I go hence I &s;hall leave behind an affec|tionate companion, your &s;on, and my two dear lit|tle infants, whom I commend to the care of a kind Providence, who is able to do more for them than I, or all the world be&s;ide. I wi&s;h you to have a watchful eye over my dear children, while you re|main in this trouble&s;ome, tran&s;itory world, and &s;ee that they are brought up in the fear of God, their Creator."</P>
<P>PROVIDENCE never more permitted her to &s;ee
<PB N="16" REF="036837_0015_100B1D43EAA04AE0">my aged mother, though &s;he lived for &s;ome time after. Her di&s;order appeared to be of the chronic|al kind, &s;low, but &s;ure and deci&s;ive in its effects: &s;he would &s;ometimes appear to be in a recovering &s;tate, but no &s;ooner did we begin to take encour|agement, than a &s;udden relap&s;e would bla&s;t our ri|&s;ing hopes. The effect which this produced on mind may be worth remarking. When her health at any time, appeared to be on the decay, &s;he &s;eemed not only cheerful, but animated with the pro&s;pect of her approaching di&s;&s;olution, to which &s;he appeared to look forward with ardent expectation. On the other hand, when any flatteding hopes of her recovery appeared, her &s;pirits &s;unk, and all her cheerfulne&s;s was buried in &s;orrow and deep melancholy. Soon after this, &s;he was &s;truck with a paralytic fit, which we feared, would put an end to her life, and indeed we thought her really dying. This was very afflictive and di&s;tre&s;|&s;ing and gave her the mo&s;t gha&s;tly appearance. This &s;truck the di&s;order almo&s;t thro' her right &s;ide; &s;oon after the had another of the &s;ame kind which le&s;t one hall of her feeble frame entirely u&s;ele&s;s. Under all the&s;e trials, &s;he appeared &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and re|rigned, rejoicing in God in the mid&s;t of her afflictions.</P>
<P>APPREHENSIVE that her end was night, &s;he im|parted to me &s;uch advice as &s;he thought mo&s;t &s;uit|able, re&s;pecting my&s;elf and our children, and after pre&s;enting &s;ome tri&s;ting articles of her clothing to her &s;i&s;ters, as tokens of her affection, "now," &s;aid &s;he, "I have &s;et my hou&s;e in order, and now, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of God, I &s;hall be ready to go when called for."&mdash;She ob&s;erved that &s;he had been hur|rying
<PB N="17" REF="036837_0016_100B1D475F1FF0F8">her bu&s;ine&s;s forward as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, for &s;ome time, previous to her &s;ickne&s;s, but that &s;he had misjudged in laying out more than &s;he was able to accompli&s;h, and acknowledged her folly and madne&s;s, in being more concerned about the affairs of this world than of her &s;oul.</P>
<P><HI>Feb.</HI> 22d. At her reque&s;t, a letter was written to a brother and &s;i&s;ter of mine in Connecticut, expre&s;|&s;ive of the tendere&s;t concern for their eternal in|tere&s;t. Being unable to take care of her child, &s;he &s;ent it away to be nur&s;ed. The thought of parting, perhaps never to &s;ee it more, brought floods of tears from her eyes. The idea of leaving her chil|dren was a great trial to her. She ob&s;erved that, formerly &s;he &s;hould have rejoiced to take them along with her, but that &s;he was now &s;en&s;ible of her great wickedne&s;s; that &s;he hoped they would live, &s;hould it be God's will, be &s;ubjects of grace and ble&s;&s;ings to &s;ociety. Her daughter's name &s;he altered from CHARLOTTE to ELIZABETH, to bear up her own name, and for the &s;ame rea&s;on, propo&s;ed to have her &s;on called after my name, with the addition of BURGHART, which was done at their bapti&s;m, previous to her death.</P>
<P><HI>Lords day, Feb.</HI> 30.] SHE appeared very gloomy and de&s;ponding, tho' &s;he contented that I &s;hould attend meeting. When I returned I found her in tears, the cau&s;e of which &s;he related. The many doubts, fears and temptations, which perplexed her mind, had almo&s;t overcome her. I then re|peated to her the words which had been the &s;ubject of our forenoon's di&s;cour&s;e, Heb. 12.2. "Look|ing unto Je&s;us the author and fini&s;her of our faith,
<PB N="18" REF="036837_0017_100B1D48E36B0058">who for the joy that was &s;et before him, endured the cro&s;s, de&s;pi&s;ing the &s;hame, and is &s;et down at the right hand of the throne of God."&mdash;This proved a &s;ea&s;onable cordial to her wounded &s;pirit; it reminded her that the was to look to Chri&s;t as her Redeemer, &s;upport and comfort, under all her afflictions.</P>
<P>SHE continued in a weak and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation till towards the end of March, having frequent re|turns of fits, tho' they grew lighter; &s;he gradually regained &s;trength, &s;o far as to be able to walk out, and in a mea&s;ure recovered the u&s;e of &s;peech.</P>
<P>ONE Sabbath day, as &s;he ob&s;erved the people re|turning from meeting, &s;he &s;ays, "O, what a ble&s;&s;ed opportunity have tho&s;e who are in health, to go and hear the word of God, but I fear that many of them improve it to as little advantage, and make as light of it as I did while in health."</P>
<P>SHE now &s;et apart a day for private fa&s;ting, hu|miliation and prayer, and could not be per&s;uaded to ta&s;te any thing from evening to evening, except medicine; but &s;aid, &s;he had rea&s;on to fa&s;t and mourn for her pa&s;t &s;ins, and for every moment which &s;he did not &s;pend with a view to God's glory.</P>
<P>WE now began to be con&s;iderably encouraged, &s;he continued gaining &s;trength, but &s;he &s;till de|clared that &s;he &s;hould not recover. When a pro&s;|pect of health appears, the influence of religion is apt to abate; but it was not &s;o with her; the im|pre&s;&s;ions made on her mind, when weak, langui&s;h|ing and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, appeared rather to acquire &s;trength with the body, than to lo&s;e their force.&mdash;She would con&s;tantly inculcate on all around her,
<PB N="19" REF="036837_0018_100B1D4A68B860A0">the importance of religion, the nece&s;&s;ity of repen|tance, and the folly and madne&s;s of putting off a work of &s;uch infinite moment to a &s;ick bed. The &s;evere&s;t trials which &s;he had at parting with this world, was the idea of leaving her tender offspring without a mother, expo&s;ed to all the en&s;naring temptations of the world. Hard, indeed, it was for her to become reconciled to the thought that &s;he mu&s;t part with them forever; fain would &s;he have lived, had it been God's will, for their &s;akes. Her attachment to her &s;i&s;ters was too great not to make the idea of a &s;eparation from them particu|larly intere&s;ting and painful. To the ordinary ties of nature in &s;uch a near relation, were added the endearments of a mo&s;t friendly and intimate ac|quaintance from their earlie&s;t infancy, as being the elde&s;t, to her had been committed, in a great mea&s;|ure, their education, which in an eminent degree, appeared to have mutually in&s;pired maternal ten|derne&s;s, on the one hand, and filial love and re&s;pect on the other: con&s;iderations which, perhaps, of all others, render the &s;ubjects of them the mo&s;t pe|culiarly endearing. She coun&s;eled them to a&s;&s;i&s;t each other in their journey through life, and walk as real &s;i&s;ters in the paths of virtue.</P>
<P>ABOUT the middle of April &s;he became able to ride out in a carriage, which &s;he did frequently, and by the la&s;t of the month, &s;he had recovered her &s;trength, &s;o far as to be able to walk to her fa|ther's hou&s;e, about a quarter of a mile. The pro&s;|pect of her recovery now appeared &s;o favorable, that I &s;lattered my&s;elf that &s;he was &s;till to be con|tinued, a comfort, and a ble&s;&s;ing to her family;
<PB N="20" REF="036837_0019_100B1D4CEBF22328">and ob&s;erved to her that I thought &s;he was likely to be di&s;appointed, and that I hoped all her por|tentous &s;igns would fail. She replied, that &s;he &s;hould not certainly be di&s;appointed, and caution|ed me again&s;t flattering my&s;elf with the pro&s;pect of her recovery, as my di&s;appointment and trial, at our &s;eparation would be the greater.</P>
<P>ONE day as I carried her abroad, we pa&s;&s;ed with|in view of the burying place, "there," &s;aid &s;he, "I &s;hall &s;hortly be laid." Nothing could be more &s;trong than the impre&s;&s;ion on her mind that &s;he was &s;oon to leave this world; &s;he appeared to enjoy her&s;elf be&s;t, when meditating on death, and was unwilling to have her mind diverted from the mel|ancholy plea&s;ing &s;ubject. Having &s;o far recovered as to be able to read, the peru&s;ed the &s;criptures with great attention and delight. She ob&s;erved that, when in an unrenewed &s;tate, the word of God appeared dull and unintere&s;ting, but that now &s;he found it a delight&s;ome and profitable book, full of the mo&s;t con&s;oling, and animating truths. Her attachment to reading, became at length, &s;o great, that we found it was detrimental to her health, and were obliged for a while, to prohibit her entirely the u&s;e of books. About this time &s;he expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to become a member of Chri&s;t's vi&s;ible Church, &s;he was accordingly propounded. This, altho' &s;he was convinced it was her duty, was nev|erthele&s;s, a great trial. She expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome fear, le&s;t, from a want of &s;elf-knowledge, &s;he might be left to di&s;honor that cau&s;e in which &s;he was about publicly to engage. She manife&s;ted a very feeling &s;en&s;e of the unmerited goodne&s;s and mercy of God
<PB N="21" REF="036837_0020_100B1D5038FD33F0">and appeared to view her&s;elf as an humble depen|dent creature, and even unworthy to be numbered with the family of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 3.] THIS was a day of peculiar trial, her fits returned, accompanied with the mo&s;t agoni|zing di&s;tre&s;s and fainting. We were almo&s;t ready to de&s;pair of her life. A new phy&s;ician was called, who pre&s;cribed &s;ome powerful means, which had the de&s;ired effect. She revived a little, and ap|peared cheerful. Altho' her pain was exce&s;&s;ive, yet &s;he manife&s;ted patience and re&s;ignation; the hand of the Lord was heavy, yet not a complaint e&s;caped her lips. She &s;aid that &s;he ought cheer|fully to accept of all that was laid upon her, as be|ing God's plea&s;ure, and ju&s;tly due to her for her di&s;obedience.</P>
<P>SHE remained in a low and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation, till about the 15th of May, when &s;he was able to ride out again. I carried her to her fathers'; we had not been long there, when it began to rain. She was very de&s;irous of returning, but by my en|treaties, and tho&s;e of the family, &s;he was at length prevailed on to &s;tay. She then ob&s;erved that &s;he had come to her fathers' hou&s;e to die. The weath|er was rainy for &s;everal days, during which time &s;he decayed very con&s;iderably.</P>
<P><HI>Lord's day, May</HI> 20.] SHE was taken with a cough attended with rai&s;ing blood, which was followed by a continual di&s;charge of ulcerated matter from her lungs. By this &s;he was deprived of the u&s;e of &s;peech for about a week. We now agreed with her in the opinion that &s;he would not recover. This relieved her from tho&s;e anxieties which her
<PB N="22" REF="036837_0021_100B1D525D0ADC38">phy&s;icians and friends had rai&s;ed in her mind re|&s;pecting her recovery. Altho' &s;he cheerfully &s;ub|mitted to the direction of her phy&s;icians, yet &s;he uniformly declared, that &s;he did it not from any hope of its being beneficial, but from a &s;en&s;e of duty. We now di&s;continued the u&s;e of medicine altogether. She continued di&s;charging a nau&s;eous and ulcerated matter, which was attended with &s;uch violent convul&s;ions of body that we frequent|ly thought her dying. In tho&s;e turns, &s;he would &s;ometimes ob&s;erve, "O, how offen&s;ive and loath|&s;ome is this body, in which, I once &s;o much de|lighted. It has become offen&s;ive even to my friends, and is rotting and wa&s;ting while I am yet alive, and robbing the worms of their food."</P>
<P>HER grave cloaths were prepared at her reque&s;t, and brought into her pre&s;ence. She was not in the lea&s;t affected at the fight, but &s;aid &s;he delighted in them more then in any dre&s;s &s;he had ever worm and lamented that &s;he had &s;pent &s;o many of her youthful days in ornamenting her body, which was but a fleeting &s;hadow, in compari&s;on with the im|mortal part. Thus &s;he continued, a con&s;tant prey to her di&s;ea&s;e, expecting every day and hour to be introduced to the "untried &s;cenes" of anoth|er world. Being a&s;ked one day, by a mini&s;ter who came to &s;ee and pray with her, what petition he &s;hould put up in her behalf; &s;he replied, "pray to God for &s;inners, and that my patience &s;ail not."</P>
<P><HI>Lords day, June</HI> 1&s;t.] IN the morning &s;he ap|peared almo&s;t exhau&s;ted, having &s;tept but poorly through the night. She ob&s;erved that it was with her in a mea&s;ure, as with the Rev. David Brainard,
<PB N="23" REF="036837_0022_100B1D54068D5670">and &s;he could &s;ay as he did, that ther natural birth was on the Sabbath, the Sabbath was al&s;o the day of her new birth if &s;he had ever experienced any; and &s;he hoped, if it was God's will, that this Sab|bath might be the day of her death. She often expre&s;&s;ed great anxiety to depart and be with Chri&s;t. The day and night following were pa&s;&s;ed by her, in the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Monday, June 2d.]</HI> Towards night, I had occa|&s;ion to leave the room a while, and when I returned I found her in tears; I enquired the cau&s;e; &s;he &s;aid that &s;he had heard the people in the other room, &s;ay that &s;he was likely to continue two or three weeks yet, that if this &s;hould be the ca&s;e, &s;he feared her patience would fail. I a&s;ked her if &s;he had ever been impatient or unea&s;y with her &s;itua|tion: She an&s;wered, that &s;he hoped &s;he bad not been guilty of that particular &s;in, tho' &s;he feared &s;he was not &s;o well reconciled to her trials as &s;he ought, and prayed fervently that God would &s;up|port and &s;trengthen her, and give her patience to wait her appointed time. And altho' &s;he lingered during &s;ix weeks, for the mo&s;t part in great di&s;tre&s;s, yet &s;he was never heard to complain, or repine at the dealings of God, but on the contrary, often &s;poke of his goodne&s;s and long-&s;uffering with the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible emotions of gratitude. In all her di&s;tre&s;s, &s;he was &s;eldom heard to groan, but now and then a deep &s;igh forced its way from her heav|ing brea&s;t, which was enough to pierce, even a heart of &s;tone.</P>
<P>HER anxiety for her children, as has been be|fore ob&s;erved was great, &s;he frequently had them
<PB N="24" REF="036837_0023_100B1D566350AA28">brought into her pre&s;ence and would embrace them with the mo&s;t tender affection, commend them to the mercy of God, and expre&s;s the extatic joy &s;he &s;hould feel, if hereafter, &s;he might meet them in Heaven. Previous to her conver&s;ion, &s;he was very de&s;irous of having our fir&s;t child given up in bapti&s;m according to the ritual of the Church of England, (&s;he having been baptized, her&s;elf in the &s;ame way, when in infancy) but I remon&s;trated &s;trongly again&s;t it, and kept her from her purpo&s;e. She expre&s;&s;ed her gratitude, that &s;he had been pre|vented from taking what, &s;he now con&s;idered, as a very erroneous mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>IN this weak and declining &s;tate &s;he remained until June 18. During which, her di&s;tre&s;s contin|ued with very little intermi&s;&s;ion to prey upon her, and it could be perceived that &s;he grew weaker. She frequently di&s;charged large quantities of putrid matter from her vitals. Her mind was variou&s;ly exerci&s;ed; &s;ometimes &s;he appeared full of joy and animation, at others, almo&s;t overwhelmed with a &s;en&s;e of her vilene&s;s. Scarcely could &s;he per&s;uade her&s;elf, that where there was &s;o much &s;in and re|maining corruption in the heart, there could be any &s;aving grace. She was many times almo&s;t ready to de&s;pond and think that God would ca&s;t her off forever. So great was her &s;en&s;e of the infi|nite purity and ju&s;tice of God, and of her own un|worthine&s;s, that &s;he feared, He would pour out his wrath upon her, as the vile&s;t of his enemies. She would frequently exclaim, "O! how is it po&s;&s;ible that &s;uch a vile wretch as I, &s;hould think of going to Heaven, to live with holy beings, and join that
<PB N="25" REF="036837_0024_100B1D59B3597E18">ble&s;&s;ed company of Saints and Angels, who &s;urround the throne of God."</P>
<P>SHE was exceedingly fond of company, e&s;pecial|ly that of Chri&s;tians. She delighted much in di&s;|cour&s;ing on Heavenly and divine things, and tho' naturally re&s;erved in her deportment, (particularly before &s;trangers) yet &s;he now appeared to throw off all re&s;erve, and to u&s;e the utmo&s;t freedom in con|ver&s;ation, and &s;eemed to exert her whole &s;trength in the &s;ervice of the Redeemer, endeavoring to convince tho&s;e around her, of the reality and im|portance of eternal things. It &s;eemed as if &s;he re|alized that &s;he had much to do and but little time in which to do it, and would frequently ob&s;erve, that it appeared to her as though &s;he made no progre&s;s in religion, but grew wor&s;e and wor&s;e.</P>
<P>ONE day as a Chri&s;tian friend, an elderly and experienced gentleman came to &s;ee her, &s;he &s;ays to him, "Come tell me &s;ome Chri&s;tian feelings, that I may know how Chri&s;tians feel." After &s;ome conver&s;ation had pa&s;&s;ed between them, he ob&s;erved to her, "you will have the advantage of us if you die now, as you will begin an eternity of happine&s;s before us." After a &s;hort pau&s;e, &s;he replied "If it &s;hould be God's will that I &s;hould land &s;afely, I would not return for a thou&s;and &s;uch worlds as this."</P>
<P>SHE was anxiou&s;ly concerned re&s;pecting her feelings at the la&s;t trying &s;cene, le&s;t the Adver&s;ary &s;hould throw in her way &s;ome trouble&s;ome tempt|ations, and cau&s;e her to doubt, and di&s;honor the cau&s;e of religion. "Oh! &s;aid &s;he, that God would &s;end his guardian Angels to defend me from Satan,
<PB N="26" REF="036837_0025_100B1D5B38F02430">and conduct me &s;afely to the man&s;ions of his Heav|enly re&s;t."</P>
<P>A DEEP &s;en&s;e of her dependence appeared ever to lie with weight on her mind. Re&s;ting her troubled &s;oul on the merits of the Redeemer, &s;he gave over all hopes of obtaining eternal life, by any other way than through his mediation. But, (as has been before ob&s;erved) her feelings were not at all times the &s;ame. Clouds would often gather and di&s;turb her peace. Doubts and fears would &s;pring up and threaten her hope. She &s;ometimes &s;eemed ready to de&s;pond under the&s;e trials, and even wi&s;h for the faith of a&s;&s;urance, that God would re|veal to her the &s;ecret coun&s;els of his will. Yet, on reflection, &s;he would retract her ra&s;h de&s;ire, and acknowledge that her immortal &s;tate was wi&s;ely hidden from her. She confe&s;&s;ed &s;he had never done any thing to merit &s;alvation, but if ever &s;he was &s;aved it mu&s;t be by free and &s;overeign grace. Whenever &s;he meditated on the doctrines of the go&s;pel, and the efficacy of the atonement, her heart found re&s;t. She expre&s;&s;ed an univer&s;al regard for her fellow creatures, more e&s;pecially for tho&s;e that belong to the family of Chri&s;t, who, &s;he &s;aid, &s;eem|ed dearer to her than her natural relatives. Noth|ing was &s;o agreeable to her as Chri&s;tian &s;ociety, &s;he delighted much in the company and conver&s;ation of Chri&s;tians with which &s;he was often favored.</P>
<P>ONE day, addre&s;&s;ing Mr. AYER, &s;he &s;aid "little did I think when I fir&s;t &s;aw you, that you would &s;o &s;oon be called on to preach my fune|ral &s;ermon as it now appears you will."</P>
<P>SHE was again &s;eized with another of that kind
<PB N="27" REF="036837_0026_100B1D5CC480ADF0">of fits to which &s;he had been &s;ubject, her feeble frame was affected with the mo&s;t violent convul|&s;ions. This made her look forward with terrifying anxiety to the time when &s;he might be deprived of her rea&s;on. Her fit la&s;ted about an hour, but the cramp &s;ucceeded, which threw her body into the mo&s;t violent contortions. No po&s;ition in which &s;he could be placed, afforded her any relief. We were obliged to u&s;e the &s;evere&s;t means to prevent her injuring her&s;elf. She would frequently cry out for help, and four per&s;ons were employed to attend her. This di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;cene continued for about twenty-four hours.</P>
<P>NEXT morning being Sabbath, a brother of mine came into the room, when &s;he ob&s;erved to him, that &s;he had become an object of di&s;gu&s;t, as her countenance was di&s;torted by recent di&s;tre&s;s. "O!" &s;aid &s;he, "I long to have the time come, when I &s;hall be relieved from all the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;ing feelings and go home to my Heavenly Father." In the cour&s;e of the day, &s;he a&s;ked me how I thought I &s;hould feel, were I &s;en&s;ible that I was about to die, and appear in the world of &s;pirits. I told her that &s;he could be&s;t an&s;wer. She replied, "it is a greater thing to die than is generally thought;" and turning towards me with an anx|ious look, &s;aid, "Oh! what dreadful feelings I find within my brea&s;t, how ju&s;tly is death &s;tiled the King of Terrors! the fear and di&s;tre&s;s, which I feel at the thought of death, I cannot de&s;cribe." Towards the clo&s;e of the day I found &s;he grew more re&s;tle&s;s. I a&s;ked her if I &s;hould read a chap|ter in the Bible for her con&s;olation? &s;he &s;aid &s;he
<PB N="28" REF="036837_0027_100B1D5FD8D4B080">did not feel &s;it to hear reading. I then a&s;ked her if I &s;hould invite the &s;ingers in after meeting to amu&s;e her with &s;inging? &s;he replied that &s;he felt unfit to hear &s;inging, or any thing that was good; that &s;he looked upon her&s;elf as the wor&s;t being in exi&s;tence, and that God would do her ju&s;tice to &s;end her in&s;tantly to de&s;truction. I then a&s;ked her, if &s;he doubted the &s;ufficiency of Chri&s;t? "Oh, no;" &s;aid &s;he, "Chri&s;t is all-&s;ufficient, ready and willing to &s;ave, but this wicked heart of mine what a &s;ink of filth and iniquity it is! I however endeav|ored to comfort her by reading a pa&s;&s;age in St. Paul's Epi&s;tle to the Hebrews, and remarked that he found cau&s;e to mourn on account of the remains of indwelling corruption, notwith&s;tanding, he was &s;o eminent a Chri&s;tian. This &s;eemed, for awhile, to ea&s;e her mind.</P>
<P>A MINISTER from a neighboring town officia|ted with us this day, and meeting being out, he came to inquire after her health. I a&s;ked her if &s;he would have him come in and pray with her; &s;he an&s;wered, that &s;he would. I then covered her face le&s;t his appearance, being a &s;tranger, &s;hould frighten her. After he came in &s;he de&s;ired to &s;ee him, but &s;he was &s;o affected with the interview, that her cramp returned, and threw her into &s;uch violent agitation, that he thought be&s;t to with|draw; but when he was about to leave the room, &s;he, in broken accents de&s;ired him to &s;top and pray with her. He then a&s;ked her if &s;he had any par|ticular reque&s;t for him to make at the throne of grace? She replied, "yes, pray that the clouds of darkne&s;s may be di&s;pelled from my mind, and
<PB N="29" REF="036837_0028_100B1D6200DD5040">that my patience may be continued to the end." As he began, &s;he fixed her eyes attentively on him, and before he had fini&s;hed his prayer, the cramp had entirely left her, and her countenance became compo&s;ed. He then conver&s;ed with her and &s;pake a few words for her con&s;olation. At her reque&s;t he told her the feelings and exerci&s;es of a Chri&s;tian, and recited to her that pa&s;&s;age of St. Paul's Epi&s;tle to the Romans, Chap. 7. ver&s;e 24th. "O wretched man that I am, who &s;hall deliver me from the body of this death!" He ob&s;erved to her that the Apo&s;tle's wretchedne&s;s con&s;i&s;ted in the &s;inful exer|ci&s;es of his heart, and the in-dwelling &s;in that &s;till remained, as in this life we are &s;anctified only in part. When he had ended his conver&s;ation, he retired; and her grief was then turned into joy. "O, &s;aid &s;he, how does my heart rejoice! How I feel the love of God &s;low through my whole frame, which warms my very &s;oul. O Je&s;us how lovely art thou in my &s;ight!"</P>
<P>BUT her cramp &s;oon returned, and her tongue was &s;o benumbed, that it was with much difficulty that &s;he &s;poke. She could only utter a few broken accents, &s;aying, "peace, peace, O what peace I enjoy, O that I could &s;pend the &s;ew remaining mo|ments I have to &s;tay in this world, in this peaceful and happy frame."</P>
<P>SHE remained in this &s;ituation for &s;everal days, and many times we thought her dying, and often called in the neighbors to &s;ee her expire. Once, in particular, her breath appeared nearly gone, and her aged Grandmother &s;tanding by, endeavored to clo&s;e her eyes but &s;he revived a little, and &s;poke
<PB N="30" REF="036837_0029_100B1D641E4B2850">in a low faltering voice, &s;aying "Pray, Madam, do not clo&s;e my eyes until I have done breathing." Thus &s;he continued, expecting &s;oon to be introdu|ced to an endle&s;s &s;tate of being, and expre&s;&s;ing her|&s;elf thus, "I am going &s;oon to try my faith; I &s;hall &s;oon appear before my Judge, there to hear my &s;entence, I &s;hall &s;oon know whether I am a &s;ervant of Je&s;us Chri&s;t or of Satan. Oh, &s;aid &s;he how it &s;hocks me, to think that my naked &s;oul mu&s;t appear before God, there to render an account of all my conduct in life; how can I &s;tand before &s;uch a holy being? But I hope that Chri&s;t will appear for me and plead my cau&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 25th.] THIS day &s;he was much affected with the cramp and fainting turns, together with a continual di&s;charging of matter from her lungs. It appeared as if nature had almo&s;t done &s;truggling with her di&s;order, and that her end could not be far di&s;tant. Yet under all the&s;e afflictions, &s;he ap|peared to have the exerci&s;es of humility and re&s;ig|nation. "O," &s;aid &s;he, "what rea&s;on have I to be thankful and adore the &s;overeign mercy and goodne&s;s of God, that he has made me &s;o greatly to differ from many of my fellow creatures, who are as good by nature as my&s;elf, and yet have no pro&s;|pect of any thing but to plunge into endle&s;s rain as &s;oon as their breath &s;hall cea&s;e." In this manner &s;he pa&s;&s;ed three days and nights with very little re&s;t and &s;carcely ta&s;ting any food. I being alone in the room with her was about to call the family. as I thought her dying. She &s;aid to me, "pray do not call them in, I wi&s;h not to be di&s;turbed by company, I hope you are not afraid to have me die alone with you."</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="036837_0030_100B1D66706DA4E0">
AN elderly Chri&s;tian friend before mentioned, who had frequently vi&s;ited her in the cour&s;e of her confinement, coming in, ob&s;erved to her in a fa|miliar manner, "why then you are yet alive; It appears you cannot die when you would." She replied "Yes, I am &s;till alive, God is able to &s;up|port me, to endure all that he is plea&s;ed to lay upon me, and will lay no more on me than I de|&s;erve." She now &s;et about &s;elf-examination. She found &s;he &s;aid, &s;uch a &s;ink of &s;in and corruption, in her vile heart, that &s;he was almo&s;t ready to con|clude that &s;he was not a child of God. She was afraid that her heart, would, after all deceive her, but rejoiced that God knew her heart, better than &s;he, and relied wholly on his &s;overeign mercy. She was often ob&s;erved to weep, becau&s;e &s;he could not live more to God's glory. "O," &s;aid &s;he, "how beautiful and lovely does Chri&s;t appear! In|finitely worthy of the highe&s;t affection and adora|tion of all his creatures." She was fearful that &s;he &s;hould lo&s;e her &s;en&s;es and be wholly deprived of rea&s;on, as her nervous complaints appeared chiefly to affect her head; but &s;aid, &s;he was &s;en&s;ible, &s;he ought to give her&s;elf no anxiety about that, for God had a right to do with her as he plea&s;ed, and de&s;ired that he would treat her in &s;uch a manner as would be mo&s;t for his own glory.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 28th.] IN the morning &s;he appeared great|ly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed having had no re&s;t the preceding night, &s;he had turns of fainting and the mo&s;t ago|nizing pain. "This" &s;aid &s;he, "is the day of my birth, this day I am twenty-&s;even years of age. I am an old &s;inner. God has permitted me to live,
<PB N="32" REF="036837_0031_100B1D68155EA460">and commit a great deal of &s;in, but i hope it is his will that I &s;hould this day be with Chri&s;t in glory. She however revived a little, and her &s;peech appear|ed more ea&s;y. She e&s;teemed it as an indi&s;pen&s;a|ble duty, at all times to admoni&s;h all, with whom &s;he had opportunity of conver&s;ing. As &s;he had her&s;elf experienced the danger of delay with regard to religion, &s;he exhorted all to &s;ecure an intere&s;t in the Saviour. She enforced the importance of ear|ly piety, and of relying wholly on the merits of the Redeemer. Even Chri&s;tians met with her ad|monitions and reproofs. She exhorted them to walk orderly before the world, that &s;inners might not &s;tumble over them into de&s;truction. She warned them not to let their hearts deceive them. To beware of building on a &s;andy foundation. Her relations and friends were repeatedly and mo&s;t feelingly exhorted by her, to become acquainted with the beauties of religion. The cau&s;e of reli|gion at large, &s;eemed to lie near her heart. She prayed earne&s;tly for the &s;ucce&s;s and pro&s;perity of the Church.</P>
<P>IN the more favorable intervals, when mo&s;t free from pain, &s;he was frequently que&s;tioned re|&s;pecting the affairs of her family. She &s;aid &s;he &s;ubmitted all tho&s;e things to the judgment and care of her &s;i&s;ter E&mdash;(who had lived with us from the time of our fir&s;t keeping hou&s;e) and that &s;he was determined to know nothing among&s;t us, &s;ave Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and him crucified.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 29th.] Her di&s;tre&s;s &s;till continued. To her ordinary pains, was added a mo&s;t violent coughing and di&s;charge of matter from her lungs,
<PB N="33" REF="036837_0032_100ADC812A3CE978">as had been the ca&s;e &s;ome time before.) One of her &s;i&s;ters &s;tanding by, while thus exerci&s;ed with extreme pain &s;he addre&s;&s;ed her as follows: "Dear Si&s;ter, we have formerly expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h that when|ever we &s;hould be called to leave this world, we might die with the con&s;umption, it being a linger|ing di&s;order; and we &s;hould con&s;equently have op|portunity to prepare for death. I have my wi&s;h, you now &s;ee me agonizing in extreme pain; but rely on it, a &s;ick bed is a mi&s;erable place to do this important work."</P>
<P>THE cramp in her jaws increa&s;ed, and affected her with pain almo&s;t in&s;upportable. Her mind appeared to be in a confu&s;ed &s;tate. She was borne down with the complicated di&s;tre&s;s, both of body and mind. She &s;aid, &s;he had a craving de&s;ire for &s;piritual food, and hungering and thir&s;ting after holine&s;s. Her Si&s;ter C&mdash;, la&s;t mentioned, came again into the room, and after conver&s;ing with her a &s;hort time on the important &s;ubject of reli|gion, &s;he de&s;ired her to de&s;i&s;t, and not interrupt her; and after lying in a &s;ilent, mu&s;ing po&s;ture for &s;ome time, &s;he broke forth into the mo&s;t lively &s;trains of joy, "O," &s;aid &s;he, "where am I! how happy do I feel, what a ravi&s;hing pro&s;pect have I of Je&s;us." She appeared to be carried away with the pro&s;pect of Heavenly bli&s;s, and her &s;oul was again filled with the rich bounties of a Heavenly fea&s;t. Not unfrequently, when almo&s;t overcome with di&s;|tre&s;s, &s;he would be revived by religious conver&s;a|tion, and would conver&s;e with the greate&s;t cheer|fulne&s;s and animation, on the doctrines of divine grace.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="036837_0033_100B1D6DD4C67370">
SHE began now to have a craving appetite for food, e&s;pecially for fruits which were brought her by her friends, and &s;he made the mo&s;t thankful acknowledgments for every favor; &s;poke much of the kindne&s;s of her neighbors, and ob&s;erved that &s;he did not think it po&s;&s;ible for any one, in her &s;ituation, to have greater attention paid them than &s;he had experienced during her &s;ickne&s;s. She longed to ha&s;te away and be at re&s;t, and would of|ten enquire what were the la&s;t &s;ymptoms of the con&s;umption. On being told, &s;he would compare them with her own feelings. Not being fully ac|quainted with the di&s;order, I had &s;till a &s;ecret hope of her recovery. I applied again to the phy&s;ician who formerly attended her. He came, left &s;ome cordial medicine and gave directions what to do. But &s;he was &s;urprized that we &s;hould attempt to do any thing more for her, and &s;aid, "it appears as if you are fighting again&s;t God, for while he is deter|mined to take me out of the world you &s;eem de|termined he &s;hall not."</P>
<P>MANY times, when Mini&s;ters and Chri&s;tian friends came to &s;ee and pray with her, &s;he would expre&s;s an unwillingne&s;s that they &s;hould pray for her continuance in this world. She ob&s;erved it was painful to her as it appeared to be contrary to God's will.</P>
<P>MY hopes, however were &s;oon bla&s;ted. She had a relap&s;e which it was not expected &s;he would &s;urvive. Her children were brought once more, for her to &s;ee, as we thought for the la&s;t time. This was an affecting &s;cene to behold. A kind mother bidding an affectionate adieu to her belov|ed
<PB N="35" REF="036837_0034_100B1D6F5B6828B8">offspring&mdash;about to leave them in a young and helple&s;s condition, in a world of &s;in and temptation, expo&s;ed to every danger&mdash;not knowing whether &s;he &s;hould ever meet them in a happier. To her, this &s;cene was &s;evere and trying. She em|braced them with the utmo&s;t affection, and ob&s;erv|ed that &s;he was about to leave them in the &s;ame condition in which &s;he her&s;elf was left, tho' in a &s;till more helple&s;s &s;tate. She &s;aid that &s;he hoped God would take them under his protection, fit them for his &s;ervice, and di&s;po&s;e of them to his glory." She exhorted me to bring them up in the fear of the Lord, and impre&s;s on them the infinite importance of religion, and whenever their under&s;tanding would permit, to remind them of the tender con|cern which their dear mother expre&s;&s;ed for them in her la&s;t moments.</P>
<P>SHE, however revived a little, and appeared comfortable. A &s;i&s;ter of mine, mentioned in the former part of this relation, came from a di&s;tance to &s;ee her. They had a joyful and happy inter|view. They anticipated, with the mo&s;t plea&s;ing rapture, their future meeting in Heaven, of which each had good rea&s;on to hope. My &s;i&s;ter being in a weak and declining &s;tate concluded &s;he &s;hould not &s;urvive her long, which proved to be the ca&s;e, for &s;he died of a child-bed &s;ickne&s;s a few months after my companion.</P>
<P>BUT to re&s;ume my narrative; her cramp abated con&s;iderably, and &s;he conver&s;ed with more ea&s;e. She ob&s;erved that nine per&s;ons of her acquaintance, had been called out of time in the cour&s;e of her fickne&s;s, "How much longer, &s;aid &s;he, I have to
<PB N="36" REF="036837_0035_100B1D71D75FCF78">continue here, God only knows." Having been at her fathers, ever &s;ince the middle of May, it was propo&s;ed to carry her home, on account of its being more retired, and &s;he being a little revived, cheer|fully con&s;ented to it. Her removal was according|ly effected without much difficulty. She appeared plea&s;ed that &s;he had once more got back to the place where her trials commenced. Her appetite now grew &s;tronger, and we began again to enter|tain &s;ome hopes of her recovery. Her mind &s;eem|ed quite compo&s;ed, and &s;he appeared to enjoy her|&s;elf well. Our family was &s;mall, Mr. AYER being one of the number. She expe&s;&s;ed great regard for him as he had &s;hewn &s;o much concern for her &s;pir|itual welfare. She enjoined it &s;trongly on him to have an eye to her children in ca&s;e of my death.</P>
<P>SHE being thir&s;ty, called to a young &s;i&s;ter of mine to bring her the gla&s;s, meaning the one which contained her drink, but through mi&s;under&s;tand|ing the looking-gla&s;s was brought. She took it, and with a &s;mile &s;he &s;ays, "You have made a mi&s;|take, but I will &s;ee how differently I appear from what I did while in health. Previous to her &s;ick|ne&s;s &s;he was a very fle&s;hy per&s;on and of a healthy countenance, but was now reduced to a mere &s;kel|eton. She was not in the lea&s;t &s;urprized at her un|favorable appearance, and &s;ignified that &s;he was fit only for worms.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 8th] BEING four days previous to her death; the Church convened at my hou&s;e, and re|ceived her as a member of their body. This filled her with joy and gratitude to God, that He had continued her life and rea&s;on and enabled her pub|licly
<PB N="37" REF="036837_0036_100B1D7556759A70">to con&s;ecrate her&s;elf to his &s;ervice before &s;he left the world.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 9th.] THIS day &s;he had another fit, which though &s;evere, as u&s;ual, did not la&s;t long, and left her tolerably comfortable. As &s;ome of our neigh|bors came in to &s;ee her, &s;he appeared cheerful and conver&s;ed with ca&s;e. Her younge&s;t child, which &s;he had never again expected to behold, was bro't home. She &s;eemed highly gratified to &s;ee him once more, and paid great attention to him. She ob&s;erved that he was an agreeable child; "But," &s;aid &s;he, "by giving him life I &s;hall be deprived of my own."</P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day, July</HI> 10th.] IN the morning &s;he ap|peared cheeful, and ob&s;erved that &s;he had re&s;ted comfortably; and &s;aid further, that &s;he did not know but &s;he &s;hould &s;till recover&mdash;that if it were God's will, &s;he believed &s;he could be reconciled to it as her friends appeared &s;o much to de&s;ire it.</P>
<P>DOMESTIC concerns for awhile occupied her attention. She gave &s;ome advice re&s;pecting our family, and intere&s;ted her&s;elf &s;o much in the affairs of life that &s;he appeared as one re&s;tored from the dead. It was not long however, before &s;he ob|&s;erved that &s;he &s;hould continue but a &s;hort time in this world, and felt, &s;he &s;aid, that &s;he had done wrong in &s;lattering her&s;elf with the hope of re|covering. A burying place was by her appointed where &s;he cho&s;e to be laid,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A plea&s;ant &s;pot of ground near the meeting-hou&s;e, where &s;he was depo&s;ited, and it has &s;ince become a pub|lic burying place.</NOTE> and all that &s;he now de|&s;ired re&s;pecting her&s;elf, was, that God would give
<PB N="38" REF="036837_0037_100B1D7773D77430">her an ea&s;y pa&s;&s;age and be with her through the dark valley of death, which &s;he had &s;o long dread|ed. But &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in an eminent degree, that hope which is the &s;oul's &s;ure anchor, which di&s;ea&s;e cannot impair, nor death de&s;troy.</P>
<P>ON being a&s;ked whether &s;he had not a remain|ing wi&s;h to recover, &s;he replied, "let God's will be done; I wi&s;h not to choo&s;e for my&s;elf, but that he would choo&s;e for me." She pa&s;&s;ed the day comfortably, tho' &s;he complained of wanderings of heart, which &s;he imputed to the unguarded hope, &s;he expre&s;&s;ed in the morning that &s;he might re|cover, and added, "The Lord has been plea&s;ed to try me both with mercies and judgments; He is merciful, in that he has been plea&s;ed to relieve me in a mea&s;ure from bodily pain, before I go hence to be here no more. But Oh, how ready is my heart to wander from God and cleave to the vani|ties of time." At night &s;he ob&s;erved, &s;he had not pa&s;&s;ed &s;o comfortable a day, as to her health, for five months pa&s;t; and we could not but be flattered with the pro&s;pect; but how &s;oon were our hopes bla&s;ted. Her appetite appeared to be good and &s;he ate heartily. But, in the cour&s;e of the evening, &s;he complained of a pain in her head; it was of the nervous kind, affecting the back part of her neck and the upper part of her head. The pain became extreme. We did every thing in our power for her relief, but to no purpo&s;e. Soon af|ter &s;he was &s;eized with puking, which &s;o affected her vitals, that to appearance, &s;he cea&s;ed breathing. But after remaining in this &s;tate, for a &s;hort time, Mr. AYER, who was &s;tanding by, examining her,
<PB N="39" REF="036837_0038_100B1D78F9E5DE70">di&s;covered appearance of life, while her friends &s;tood round weeping and waiting with anxiety for her returning breath. We applied to her mouth &s;ome powerful drops, when &s;he, by degrees revived, and her &s;en&s;es being probably blunted by the lo&s;s of her rea&s;on, the appeared to be in a mea&s;ure uncon|&s;cious of her extreme angui&s;h. She continued in a kind of delirious &s;tate through the night.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 11th] THIS day &s;he lay in a bewildered &s;tate, her eyes, for the mo&s;t part clo&s;ed, tho' &s;he would frequently open and fix them attentively on tho&s;e around her; but &s;eldom &s;peaking or an|&s;wering if &s;poken to. Death, the fatal me&s;&s;enger of Heaven, appeared to be at no great di&s;tance, and &s;he &s;eemed quietly to wait his approach. Oh, &s;aid &s;he, I hope I &s;hall &s;oon go where there is no more &s;ighing, nor &s;orrow nor weeping. Where nothing can di&s;turb my felicity."</P>
<P><HI>The following que&s;tions and an&s;wers which pa&s;&s;ed between us, it may not be improper to in&s;ert; &s;he &s;poke with much difficulty and with a weak and faltering voice.</HI></P>

<P>I then ob&s;erved to her, what un&s;peakable joy and con|&s;olation &s;he mu&s;t have, as God had promi&s;ed to be a friend and father to the needy, and nigh unto tho&s;e who put their tru&s;t in him. "Well, &s;aid &s;he, I am needy, and added in the words of the Poet,</P>

I TOLD her I hoped &s;he had his pre&s;ence with her. She then ca&s;t a wi&s;hful look upwards with joy painted on her countenance, and extended her withered arms as though &s;he would embrace her de&s;ired object, and cried with an elevated voice, "O, come Lord Je&s;us, come quickly, come" She then clo&s;ed her eyes and lay to appearance, compo&s;ed.
