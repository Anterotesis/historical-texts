<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>BOSTON,</HI> <DATE><HI>February</HI> 27. 1777.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AT a time when degenerate Britons are with brutal rage, and the greate&s;t inju&s;tice, u&s;ing every means in their power to wre&s;t from their American Brethren every thing that ought to be held dear and invaluable by any people; our Country may ju&s;tly demand not only from tho&s;e who are more immediately concerned in the management of their public affairs, but from every individual his utmo&s;t exertions for its defence and &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>The faire&s;t pro&s;pect we have that the de&s;igns of our Enemies will prove abortive, and the cau&s;e of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s, in the defence and e&s;tabli&s;hment of civil and religious Liberty, will finally prevail, ari&s;es from that Union of the Independent States of America, which in the favor of Providence has &s;o remarkably taken place: Our Enemies are ju&s;tly alarmed at this pro&s;pect, and &s;pare no pains, nor &s;cruple any means, in order to break or weaken not only the general Union, but even the Unity and Harmony of a particular State.&mdash;For the accompli&s;hment of &s;o ba&s;e an intention, how many fal&s;e Reports, relative to the De&s;igns and Acts of Congre&s;s, a particular Government or Town have been indu&s;triou&s;ly circulated&mdash;what wrong turns have been given to, and irritating remarks made upon their Re&s;olves and Tran&s;actions.&mdash;It may be as needle&s;s as it would prove tire&s;ome to advert to particular In&s;tances, our memories mu&s;t be crouded with them.</P>
<P>Among the many happy con&s;equences which have been derived from the appointment of Committees of Corre&s;pondence through this and the other States, it is not the lea&s;t of them, that our inveterate Enemies have hereby been defeated in their projects to deceive.</P>
<P>The Act of this and the other New England States to prevent Monopoly and Oppre&s;|&s;ion, by affixing Prices to the Nece&s;&s;aries of Life, has given a new opportunity to the Enemies of America for their in&s;idious Practices; and it is from intelligence received, that the Town of Bo&s;ton has been greatly mi&s;repre&s;ented as a Town, that we have the honor to write and tran&s;mit you by their order "an account of their public tran&s;actions relative to &s;aid Act," and re&s;pectfully to a&s;k "your interpo&s;ition and kind offices to pre|vent any mi&s;under&s;tanding by fal&s;e Reports &s;pread daily by the Tory Party" to prejudice the People of the Country again&s;t a Town which has been long the butt of their calumny and vengeance.</P>
<P>On the 6th in&s;tant a Meeting of the Inhabitants was called, "to con&s;ider and deter|mine upon the mo&s;t effectual Mea&s;ures to have the Act of the General Court to prevent Monopoly and Oppre&s;&s;ion &s;trictly complied with, not only from regard to the Authority and Laws of this State, but as ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the effectual &s;ecurity of the e&s;&s;ential Rights and Liberties of America."&mdash;At this Meeting, which was full and united, a Committee of 36 Per&s;ons were cho&s;en out of the &s;everal wards, of &s;uch as were not in trade; "to aid and a&s;&s;i&s;t the Selectmen and Committee of Corre&s;pondence, by information or other legal ways, in carrying into execution the &s;aid Act."&mdash;At this meeting al&s;o a Committee of &s;even were appointed, "to con&s;ider and report at the adjournment what they judge nece&s;&s;ary for the Town to do, in order to procure a &s;ufficient &s;upply of provi&s;ions of all kind, and to promote the &s;alutary intentions of the late Act."&mdash;</P>
<P>The afore&s;aid Committee on the 12th current reported, and after ob&s;erving that a number of our worthy Inhabitants were &s;elling their Goods at the prices affixed in the late Act, and expre&s;&s;ing their apprehen&s;ion, that if all would do &s;o the Town would &s;oon have as full a &s;upply of provi&s;ions as is u&s;ual at this &s;ea&s;on of the year proceeded "mo&s;t earne&s;tly
<PB N="2" REF="043227_0002_101CD9EA167FC400">
to recommend to all the Inhabitants of this Town a &s;trict compliance with the Act, as they regarded the peace of the Town, the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the poor, fixing our medium at a certain value, and &s;trengthning the hands of Government at this critical and important day &mdash; Al&s;o that the Committees of other Towns be informed, that the Inhabitants of this Town will exert them&s;elves to the utmo&s;t that the people in the Country Towns &s;hall be &s;upplied with any articles agreable to the prices affixed in the late act of this State for preventing monopolies, &amp;c." This Report was accepted at a large meeting, Nem. Con.</P>
<P>In order for the carrying this Report into effect, the forementioned Committee of thirty-&s;ix were directed, "to apply to all tho&s;e per&s;ons in this Town who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Flour, We&s;t-India or other Goods enumerated in the late Act, and require of them a direct an&s;wer to the following que&s;tion, viz. <HI>Will you take the price &s;et by this State?</HI> and to report the names and an&s;wers of &s;aid per&s;ons, that the &s;ame may be made public in the News-Papers, to &s;hew the readine&s;s of the inhabitants of this Town to comply with &s;aid Act."&mdash;Which Committee reported at the adjournment on the 19th in&s;tant, "That agreable to direction they had applied to the Merchants and Traders in their re&s;pective wards, who declared that they would conform to the Act, by &s;elling their articles agreable to the prices fixed by the Act of this State."</P>
<P>The foregoing contains the &s;ub&s;tance of our tran&s;actions as a Town with re&s;pect to the late Act; &s;ince which the Selectmen of the Town and this Committee, together with many other Inhabitants, in their private capacity, have exerted them&s;elves with &s;ucce&s;s that our Brethren from the Country who bring us their produce, as well as the Inhabi|tants, might be &s;upplied with the articles they wanted; but as &s;uch is the imperfection even of the be&s;t laws for preventing monopoly and oppre&s;&s;ion, that the avaricious and de&s;igning often find ways and methods to elude them, and to prevent that full benefit being derived to the People which good Legi&s;lators always intend, it &s;o happens with re&s;pect to the pre&s;ent Act, that tho&s;e great clamourers again&s;t it, viz. Monopolizers and Fore&s;tallers, the bane of Town and Country, and who ought to be equally dete&s;ted by both, apprehending a law of this &s;ort, did, previous to its taking place, export and remove a great part of their goods into the Country, and to other States, &s;o that mo&s;t of the &s;hops and &s;tores of this Town, to the di&s;appointment of the Inhabitants, are now almo&s;t bare of European and We&s;t-India goods; and when the Selectmen have, pur&s;uant to the Act, entered any warehou&s;e in behalf of &s;uch as had made application, they could only obtain a &s;upply for the wants of a particular family, or of individuals; the Seller &s;uppo&s;ing the Act would not ju&s;tify the forcing away a &s;upply for the Baker, Di&s;tiller, Retailer, Huck&s;ter or &s;mall Trader, it being left, as they con&s;true the Law, to the Owners option to &s;ell either by whole&s;ale or retail; and indeed in this latter way, the inhabitants of Town and Country are now generally &s;upplied out of the Shops and Stores which contain the Goods &s;till left in Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the ju&s;t and prudent mea&s;ures of the Town, and zealous endeavors of Selectmen, Committees and Individuals, to bring the <HI>Monopoli&s;ers</HI> and <HI>Engro&s;ers</HI> to rea&s;on, by a compliance with this Act, it is with real concern that we acquaint you that our Brethren in the Country, from the fal&s;e reports and in&s;inuations of the avaricious and ill-affected, are induced to withhold the u&s;ual and common &s;upplies of Provi&s;ions and other Nece&s;&s;aries of Life, to the grief and injury of the Body of the Inhabitants, and the triumph of our Adver&s;aries.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="043227_0003_101CAC9A61FA4DA0" MS="y">It &s;hould have been ob&s;erved before, and it de&s;erves your particular attention, that &s;oon after the Town was opened, Traders from all parts of this and the neighbouring States flocked to our Vendues, and until &s;aid Act was pa&s;&s;ed, to our a&s;toni&s;hment and damage much exceeded in their bids the u&s;ual prices of &s;uch articles in our Shops and Stalls.&mdash;Upon the Sale of Prizes brought into this Port, the Purcha&s;ers were mo&s;tly from the Country and other States, and by far the greate&s;t part of the Goods bought has been carried from us.&mdash;The Board of War and the Continental Agents have been purcha&s;ing largely for the u&s;e of the Army, and &s;uch Articles al&s;o as could be remitted to foreign Ports with lea&s;t lo&s;s, for procuring Cloathing for the Army and Military Stores; which drains, with tho&s;e before mentioned, may account for the pre&s;ent &s;carcity in Town, and tho&s;e of you who dwell on our main Roads may ob&s;erve to this Day a large number of Teams and other Carriages pa&s;&s;ing with Salt, We&s;t India and other Goods to Places in this State for the u&s;e of the Inhabitants, the value whereof has been computed to exceed what is brought in to us from the Country as fifty to one.</P>
<P>Your candor will allow us to add, that the pre&s;ent &s;ituation and circum&s;tances of the Farmer and Merchant are very different from what they have been in a time of peace&mdash;the fleets of Britain &s;eizing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> trade&mdash;in&s;urance and every material for &s;hipping at the highe&s;t rates; and the little merchandize which fortunately e&s;capes the enemy, together with what is brought in by our &s;hips of war, falling into the hands of but few per&s;ons, and the prices thereof continuou&s;ly &s;hifting, as they depend on contingencies: Whereas, on the other &s;ide, the Earth as formerly yields her increa&s;e;&mdash;the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Farmer is carried on nearly as u&s;ual; and con&s;equently a more full and &s;teady &s;upply may be expected from the Country.</P>
<P>We therefore hope you will heartily join us in endeavours to prevent any thing's taking place, which may in the i&s;&s;ue prove peculiarly detrimental to the People in general at this cri&s;is of our affairs, and that your influence will not be wanting to remove unrea|&s;onable prejudices again&s;t a Town, who&s;e merits and &s;ufferings in the common cau&s;e of America are too numerous and recent to need recapitulation.</P>
<P>Permit us to congratulate you on the late great and glorious &s;ucce&s;s, with which the Supreme Ruler of the World has favour'd the aims of the United States, and to acquaint you that as we could not hope for &s;uch future interpo&s;itions of Divine Providence in our behalf, in the neglect of any means within our own power, we have therefore under all our em|barra&s;&s;ments &s;o exerted our&s;elves for the rai&s;ing a new army, as that many more than our proportion of the Continental Battalions, as &s;tated by this Government, have been already inli&s;ted in this Town.</P>
<P>We &s;hall be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> to co-operate with you in any thing which may pro|m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters"> the general good, and are, with all due regard,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your Friends and humble Servants, Signed by direction and in behalf of the Committee of Corre&s;pondence, In&s;pection and Safety of the Town of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
