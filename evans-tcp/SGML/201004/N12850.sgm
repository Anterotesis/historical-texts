<P>ALTHOUGH immediate peace is nece&s;&s;ary for the welfare and &s;afety of the nation, and that peace cannot be had but by the acknowledgment of the independency of America, in which all Europe, and indeed the whole univer&s;e are intere&s;ted; yet, becau&s;e a formal acknowledgment of it would be mo&s;t humiliating to the pride of the nation, it is thought, by &s;ome, more advi&s;eable to make u&s;e of expedients, and to obtain the nece&s;&s;ary tranquility, either</P>

<ITEM>III. By de&s;troying every thing before the &s;truggle is given up, in order to cripple the Americans in their future operations.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Every one of the&s;e ways are inadequate to the end.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, a truce made between Great-Britain and America will defeat what is, and ought to be, the fir&s;t object of government; it will not only be an acknowledgment, <HI>pro <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">anto et pro tempore,</HI> of the claimed independency, but will prevent the two people returning to their ancient good humour and harmony, the great object of the propo&s;ed tranquility; for &s;uch truce will be, as all truces are, armed and full of &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="016245_0004_0F9BCFABCEA5C180">
2dly, To withdraw the troops and leave the Americans to them&s;elves will not have the appearance of the dignity, but &s;ullenne&s;s of maje&s;ty; it will be a proof of the pre&s;ent impo|tency, and future intention of this &s;tate, and, con&s;equently, will beget in the Americans pre&s;ent contempt, and future dread; this contempt, and dread, will encourage and pro|voke on their part the pro&s;ecution of the war, which is wi&s;hed to be avoided: There is, however, rea&s;on to think &s;ome &s;uch mea&s;ure is now pur&s;uing, the troops having been ordered, it is &s;aid, to abandon New-York. Whether this is done through inability to maintain that po&s;t, or to &s;uccour the capital and e&s;|&s;ential parts of the empire at this critical juncture, is not worth the pre&s;ent enquiry; it is probable the o&s;ten&s;ible rea&s;on will be given, that it is done for the bringing about a treaty, the Americans having made this &s;tep one of the alternatives ne|ce&s;&s;ary to be complied with before they would treat; to prove this, however, the Briti&s;h force mu&s;t be withdrawn from all the territories claimed by the Americans; if a part is left any where, at Rhode-I&s;land for in&s;tance, which perhaps is meant to be made a place of arms, the whole mea&s;ure will be abor|tive: It is worth recollecting, likewi&s;e, that when this pro|po&s;ition, of either acknowledging the independency or with|drawing the troops, was fir&s;t made, America &s;tood uncon|nected and free from real or implied &s;tipulations with foreign powers; the ca&s;e is now &s;o altered, that there may be doubts whether &s;he is able, or willing, to act in any thing without the concert and concurrence of France; but, at mo&s;t, this alternative is only a preliminary of a treaty, the e&s;&s;ential ob|ject of which is the American independency.</P>
<P>3dly, The retiring after having done all po&s;&s;ible mi&s;chief is the council of folly and malice; it proceeds from de&s;pair, and would for ever &s;hut the door of peace; it would produce an eternal abhorrence.</P>
<P>Should it be thought, on con&s;ideration, that neither of the&s;e expedients are proper, for that Great-Britain can now do nothing but acknowledge the independency of America, yet that this acknowledgment ought not to be made &s;imply and unconditionally; it would be well for &s;uch to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, that although there was a time when this mode of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> and bargaining might have been propo&s;ed, and agreed to, that
<PB N="5" REF="016245_0005_0F9BCFAC900234A0">time is now pa&s;t: There was a time when this i&s;land might have offered independency to America as a conce&s;&s;ion requir|ing &s;ome valuable return; at pre&s;ent, having vindicated, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing it in fact, and being guaranteed in the enjoyment thereof by one of the greate&s;t powers, who&s;e influence and example will induce others to take the &s;ame &s;tep, America will not con&s;ider the acknowledgment of independence as a favour: The right and power which &s;he pre&s;umes &s;he has to maintain her&s;elf in her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and the fear le&s;t &s;uch a mode of bargaining might bring doubts on her unque&s;tioned right, and of &s;etting a dangerous precedent to other nations for her emancipation and purcha&s;e of freedom, will oblige her to in&s;i&s;t on this acknowledgment in the mo&s;t perfect, ab|&s;olute, &s;imple, and unconditional manner.</P>
<P>If &s;uch acknowledgment is made, the object of the peace, which would undoubtedly follow, would be obtained, the good opinion of America would be &s;ecured, time would be thereby given for the removal of the pre&s;ent &s;u&s;picions and abhorrence, and for the return of the former amity and good will; it would give an opening to the ancient inter|cour&s;e, and a di&s;po&s;ition of conducting it with candor and liberality; the &s;trength, re&s;ulting from thence, would be a benefit, and not a terror, to this i&s;land: America would then, though independent, be united in heart to Great-Britain, in|&s;tead of being, as &s;he is at pre&s;ent, independent and united with her enemies. This country, even amid&s;t her mo&s;t cruel actions, a&s;&s;ured her&s;elf of the return of the antient good hu|mour of America; and, indeed, a&s;&s;ured her&s;elf &s;o much of it, that, however &s;trange it may appear, it is mo&s;t certain, this her natural di&s;po&s;ition was made u&s;e of as an encourage|ment and provocation to the utmo&s;t exertions of the mo&s;t unrelenting war; for, do what you will, it was &s;aid, Ame|rica would &s;till look up to, and wi&s;h to renew, her antient connection with this i&s;land. Let this &s;uppo&s;ed temper of America be tried in the only way now left; force has been found not only ineffectual, but pernicious; let time do that which force cannot do; let that time of peace and its de&s;ired operations be obtained by an immediate, clear, and full ac|knowledgment of the independency of America.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="016245_0006_0F9BCFAED299B030">
Should all difficulties relative to the matter of a treaty be thus removed, there would &s;till remain difficulties relative to the manner of conducting it; as government, however, has at length got rid of an embarra&s;&s;ment which had been thought in&s;uperable, and had long checked the proper cour&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s, it cannot be doubted that either wi&s;dom or ne|ce&s;&s;ity will induce it to adopt the only mode of obtaining peace now left.</P>
<P>To treat with tho&s;e who denied, and took up arms in op|po&s;ition to the authority of Parliament; to treat with declar|ed enemies, and, above all, with the <HI>unlawful</HI> and <HI>vagrant</HI> A&s;&s;embly, the Congre&s;s, were once con&s;idered &s;o contrary to the dignity of government as not to be &s;ubmitted to. The &s;tate of things has produced a different &s;en&s;e in the mini&s;ter; the Parliament has impowered Commi&s;&s;ioners to treat with that obnoxious body, thinking it was the only medium through which peace with America could be had. On the &s;ame principle, another mode mu&s;t now be adopted; we not only want peace with America, but with France, and the re&s;t of Europe; but peace with the one cannot now be had, <HI>nor indeed is it worth having,</HI> without peace with the other: we mu&s;t now negociate, and that &s;oon, or an important part of Europe will interfere, and thereby embarra&s;s the nego|ciation with the adju&s;tment of new intere&s;ts and claims. This can only be effected by an immediate application to the American Commi&s;&s;ioners at Paris. The propo&s;ition may at fir&s;t &s;tartle the people of this country, but the &s;urpri&s;e will be &s;oon got over, if the &s;tate of affairs are duly con&s;idered&mdash; Things once &s;trange now appear familiar to them&mdash;Strange, however, as this may appear, the only mode of attaining peace is to con&s;ider and make the American Commi&s;&s;ioners at Paris MEDIATORS between Great-Britain and France; for, though inimical at pre&s;ent becau&s;e of the ho&s;tile di&s;po&s;ition of this country, they have at bottom, as is &s;uppo&s;ed, an at|tachment to it. Change, then, your di&s;po&s;ition, and theirs will be changed; they will be the friends of Great-Britain in her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">llen &s;tate, who have oppo&s;ed her in her <HI>hour of in&s;o|lence;</HI> they mu&s;t be con&s;idered better di&s;po&s;ed to this people than the hireling mini&s;ter of any foreign &s;tate; and, if treat|ed with candour, may be tru&s;ted with &s;ecurity&mdash;there is little doubt that France would accept their mediation.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="016245_0007_0F9BCFAEE97D3358">
Should it be que&s;tioned, whether the American Commi&s;|&s;ioners at Paris have powers &s;ufficient to &s;ettle the &s;ub&s;i&s;ting differences, the doubt might be &s;oon cleared up by an imme|diate application; in the mean while it may be pre&s;umed they have &s;uch powers: for, is it probable that the Congre&s;s &s;hould have enabled their Commi&s;&s;ioners to enter into treaties of commerce and eventual leagues offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive, for the opening a new intercour&s;e and for the carrying on a war, without enabling them to continue the antient connec|tion and preventing war? There is no rea&s;on to think their judgment &s;o defective. Should it, however, prove, on en|quiry, they have not powers &s;ufficiently &s;atisfactory to con|clude a perfect treaty, yet no one can be &s;o ignorant of the weight and influence of the American Commi&s;&s;ioners, as not to imagine their recommendations will have the fulle&s;t effect with Congre&s;s. In the mean while a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms may be obtained in Europe, on the credit, liberality, and inte|grity of the terms propo&s;ed. This is a point of the greate&s;t con&s;equence in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the afrairs of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>This form, and it is now perhaps little el&s;e, the Americans having the reality, being complied with, Great-Britain will prevent the impending mi&s;chief and ruin which the combi|nation of the Powers of Europe, intere&s;ted in the independ|ency of America, will otherwi&s;e bring down upon her; and America will obtain the only thing &s;he wants: She wants nothing from Europe but peace; which being had, &s;he will &s;hew her&s;elf to Europe in general a mo&s;t beneficial friend, and to Great-Britain in particular an <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> one.</P>
<P>This will be manife&s;t to any one who con&s;iders the nature of the northern continent of America, and the &s;tate of Eu|rope; it is not nece&s;&s;ary here to enter into this di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. There is nothing more clear than that &s;he really wants no|thing, and can &s;upply the wants of Europe; this takes away all ground of contention between them. If America &s;tands in need of peace to &s;ettle her governments, Great-Britain &s;tands in need of it for the &s;upport of her exi&s;tence; neither, therefore, have claims on each other, for the ble&s;&s;ing which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to both, but in proportion to the greater nece&s;|&s;ity of one or the other.&mdash;America, however, may perhaps
<PB N="8" REF="016245_0008_0F9BCFAFA7CC6A60">be induced to make &s;tipulations of great importance to Great-Britain.</P>
<P>She may agree not to pa&s;s the Cape of Good Hope, or go round Cape Horn; &s;he may di&s;claim all connection with Africa, and its accur&s;ed trade; &s;he may engage not only not to po&s;&s;e&s;s any part of the We&s;t-India I&s;lands, but guarantee to England her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions there. The&s;e are matters of great con&s;equence to this country, but of little moment to Ame|rica: They are of little moment to America, who wants not extended and di&s;tant territory; &s;he has her&s;elf more land, capable of every produce, than can be cultivated for ages to come; &s;he knows the mi&s;chiefs of the India trade, and &s;hud|ders at the impiety of the African one; the &s;ituation, and nece&s;&s;ity of the I&s;lands, will ever make them more beneficially dependent on the Continent, than the claim and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of unlimited power over them; and their pre&s;ent political par|tition among the &s;everal &s;tates of Europe, is more advan|tageous to her than their engro&s;&s;ment by any one prince.</P>
<P>The&s;e things are &s;ugge&s;ted to &s;hew that the &s;tipulations on the&s;e heads will be ob&s;erved, becau&s;e the continent of America has no real intere&s;t in the breach of them;&mdash;a better ground for political faith cannot be had: But although the continent of America has no real intere&s;t in the interruption of the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the powers of Europe, yet, actuated by the &s;pirit of ho&s;tility, if provoked, &s;he will nece&s;&s;arily inter|fere, and give &s;uch di&s;turbance as to render their enjoyment highly precarious at lea&s;t; and thereby become, from ne|ce&s;&s;ity, a dangerous enemy, in&s;tead of being a beneficial friend.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;tipulations are well worth the attention of the mi|ni&s;ter; but there are, likewi&s;e, conce&s;&s;ions, which might be made of the greate&s;t con&s;equence to this country. She may be induced to take a certain quantity of her manufactures, and &s;upply her with naval &s;tores for a certain number of years; &s;he may enter into engagements about the fi&s;heries on her coa&s;ts, the importance of which is well known; &s;he might di&s;claim an interference with, or interruption of, the trade to Hud&s;on's Bay, the full value of which mo&s;t are ignorant of; &s;he may, in &s;hort, &s;ecure, by articles of pacification and com|merce,
<PB N="9" REF="016245_0009_0F9BCFB051F486F0">the mo&s;t profitable parts of the Briti&s;h trade, which will be greatly endangered by the continuance of the pre&s;ent war. But let it be remembered that the&s;e articles, &s;tipulations and conce&s;&s;ions, mu&s;t be &s;ub&s;equent to, and not on condition of, the acknowledgment of independency: The prior ac|knowledgment is nece&s;&s;ary to give validity and an obligatory force to the mutual engagements of the two countries, which, without it, might in &s;ome future hour of chicane be much que&s;tioned.</P>
<P>But, that this and other important matters may be gained, the application ought to be <HI>immediate and open.</HI> The delay of doing what was right has increa&s;ed the public mi&s;chief, and daily embarra&s;&s;es the progre&s;s of peace; it brought on the American declaration of independency, and the French guarantee, and war, in &s;upport of it. A farther delay will produce other fatal con&s;equences. No one can doubt the part which Spain will take, who knows the part &s;he has already taken. That Portugal will follow the dictates of Spain, now &s;he is thrown into her arms by the inability of England to protect her, is perhaps certain; her intere&s;t, and her inclina|tion, concur with her pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ity: Will the Dutch &s;tand out when the Americans &s;hall declare, and the declaration, if not already made, may be expected &s;oon, <Q>they will not trade with any Powers that &s;hall not acknowledge her in|dependency?</Q> The Dutch, again&s;t whom the act of na|vigation was levelled, will rejoice at its &s;ub&s;tantial repeal, and eagerly enjoy the freedom of the &s;ea, and of commerce, on the terms propo&s;ed. Should Great-Britain come into the ne|ce&s;&s;ary mea&s;ure after the&s;e powers, &s;he will do it with &s;o ill a a grace, that her merit will be &s;mall indeed.</P>
<P>But, above all, the application ought to be open; it ought to be &s;incere and candid in it&s;elf, and without di&s;gui&s;e o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> my&s;tery in the making. The former applications, either of a public or private nature, have been defective on this head; there has been deceit, at lea&s;t it appears &s;o to the Americans, in the matter and manner of them. If application is now made to the Commi&s;&s;ioners at Paris, all under-hand dealings mu&s;t be omitted, becau&s;e they cannot have the de&s;ired effect; it is the attempt I would guard again&s;t, for the practice of ar|tifice cannot &s;ucceed. By the nature of the government of
<PB N="10" REF="016245_0010_0F9BCFB1126895E0">France, few things done in that country can be kept &s;ecret; a negotiation with America can by no means be concealed; it is the particular intere&s;t and honour of the American Com|mi&s;&s;ioners at Paris to di&s;cover to the French Court all &s;uch ap|plications from Britain; private attempts will, as the preced|ing ones have done, turn again&s;t the mini&s;ter; they will give the Americans, as they have in all matters &s;ince the 16th of December la&s;t, much advantage in negotiation; it will give them the merit of di&s;covering to the French mini&s;ter how much they are courted by the Engli&s;h government, and, by con&s;equence, induce him to court them more.</P>
<P>Not a &s;ingle attempt to gain the Americans has yet &s;uc|ceeded, becau&s;e candour was wanting; the attempts were treacherous in them&s;elves, and &s;u&s;picious in their manner. Men of all denominations and characters have been &s;ent, &s;ome of whom, under the ma&s;k of friend&s;hip, have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> into the deepe&s;t political di&s;cu&s;&s;ions&mdash;They were &s;ent for that purpo&s;e, whatever their o&s;ten&s;ible pretences were to the con|trary&mdash;they lo&s;t their errand; they were con&s;idered as the tools of the mini&s;ter, and not as the unre&s;erved, unde&s;igning and confidential friends of the &s;ocial hour; they played their parts, and were perhaps de&s;ervedly played upon.</P>
<P>But whatever they were, they were &s;uited to the bu&s;ine&s;s they were &s;ent on. The bu&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t now have another complexion, and, by con&s;equence, agents of a different di&s;|po&s;ition. If the terms of accommodation are candid and li|beral, as the times require, the agents need not be men of noted learning, or political abilities; depend more on the matter which is to be offered, than on the man who delivers it. In truth, no man is wanted that an&s;wers only to the cha|racter of an agent; a faithful me&s;&s;enger will do the bu&s;ine&s;s much better; the times want not the adroitne&s;s of a poli|tician, but the &s;implicity and good intentions of a commen man, for the happine&s;s of Great-Britain and America.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider what the public and parliamentary Commi&s;&s;ioners have done in America; their &s;ucce&s;s is now fully known: They are men of rank, note and confidence, of various qua|lities and abilities; but, whatever rank, note, confidence, qualities and abilities they may have, they are by no means
<PB N="11" REF="016245_0011_0F9BCFB1D9FE2108">the men proper to have been &s;ent: One of them, in parti|cular, who has &s;tepped forward mo&s;t bu&s;ily in the commi&s;|&s;ion, &s;eems to betray it; he is abu&s;ive of tho&s;e who have employed him, for their in&s;olence; and mo&s;t flattering to the great qualities of his enemies, who have oppo&s;ed his country; he apparently ju&s;tifies the one, and condemns the other, for all their proceedings; and, in&s;tead of a Commi&s;&s;ioner of the King of Great-Britain, paid an enormous &s;alary for the di&s;|charge of a public employment, he wi&s;hes to become the curious and wondering traveller, and no more: If more is intended by this abu&s;e, flattery and curio&s;ity, it is &s;uch an unworthy piece of bu&s;ine&s;s, as would warrant any one's im|puting the failure of the commi&s;&s;ion to the choice of him and his coadjutors, if there was not in the commi&s;&s;ion it&s;elf an internal vice and cau&s;e of defeat.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, it is not by &s;uch means this country can be &s;aved from the ruin which the American di&s;pute is likely to bring upon it.</P>
<P>The terms of accommodation ought to do their own bu|&s;ine&s;s; they ought to be &s;o good as to recommend them&s;elves; they will do it, if they are &s;uited to the times.</P>
<P>The American treaty, &s;igned at Ver&s;ailles the 6th of Fe|bruary, was &s;uppo&s;ed here not to be perfect until ratified by the people of America, and therefore the Engli&s;h Commi&s;|&s;ioners, arriving in the country before that event, would ea&s;ily &s;et the whole a&s;ide by the offers of Parliament. The French King knew better; he well knew his offers were &s;uch as in&s;ured to them&s;elves the approbation of America; he waited not for the return of the ratification; he took his mea&s;ures as if every thing was concluded. The event has ju&s;tified his judgment.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding what has been, and might be, &s;aid to in|duce a full and direct acknowledgment of the independency of America, and an immediate and open application to the Commi&s;&s;ioners at Paris, there are, perhaps, tho&s;e who think it will be more for the intere&s;t and honour of the kingdom, to &s;ue for peace in a private manner in the clo&s;et of the mini&s;ters of France.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="016245_0012_0F9BCFB28F418480">
The object of this mode of application is to avoid, if po&s;&s;i|ble, the acknowledgment of the American independency; for it is thought there can be no &s;acrifice, however great, which may and ought not to be made for the recovery of the real, or at lea&s;t the nominal, &s;overeignty of that country: They who are of this opinion will go great lengths; they will per|haps offer Canada to France, acknowledge her right, and give her fre&s;h means of carrying on to advantage the Fi&s;heries on the Banks of Newfoundland, and confirm her in the &s;tipulated part of the American commerce.

<P>The idea of excluding the i&s;land of Great-Britain from the commerce of the continent of America will be plea&s;ing to all the powers of Europe. They will rejoice at &s;uch a &s;ignal de&s;truction of an envied monopoly; and perhaps con&s;ider it, in&s;ultingly, as an act of ju&s;tice, that <HI>that</HI> &s;hould be the only &s;tate excluded from the coa&s;ts of America, which, arrogating the whole to it&s;elf, had excluded the re&s;t of mankind.</P>
<P>There is nothing exclu&s;ive in the original treaty of com|merce and alliance between France and America; this country was candidly told &s;o, and thereby an hint given, what might be. The nece&s;&s;ity of affairs may give another turn to the treaty.&mdash; The longer the contention is continued, and the more violent|ly it is pre&s;&s;ed, the more will the affections of America be alienated from England, and the more firmly will they be fixed on France.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more ab&s;urd, dangerous and fruitle&s;s, than an endeavour to procure an e&s;tabli&s;hment of the former &s;ove|reignty by the means of France; it is the intere&s;t of France, that you &s;hould have neither the <HI>former &s;overeignty no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> peace.</HI> The independence of America is of more value to her than any thing this country can offer; it &s;ecures every effect and benefit of the mo&s;t humble conce&s;&s;ions, and does every po&s;&s;ible mi&s;chief to her rival and avowed enemy. The mini&s;ter, therefore, may depend on it, &s;he will &s;ide with America, who hath firmly with&s;tood the various public and private applica|tions to withdraw her&s;elf from her engagement;&mdash;it is both the inclination and intere&s;t, and, after what has pa&s;&s;ed, the honour of France to con&s;ider her alliance &s;acred and inviolable.</P>
<P>Should the offers of the mini&s;ter be as con&s;iderable, or more &s;o than what has been &s;ugge&s;ted, reflect on the con&s;e|quences&mdash;they mu&s;t be &s;o con&s;iderable as to enable France to pro&s;ecute her &s;chemes with greater certainty in future, or el&s;e &s;he will certainly not forego her pre&s;ent advantage; they
<PB N="14" REF="016245_0014_0F9BCFB4194FA510">will be &s;o great as to give that court &s;u&s;picions that they are only offered at this time to gain a &s;overeignty, and former connection, by which the force of America may be de&s;po|tically collected, or artfully turned again&s;t her by the &s;pecious &s;hew of moderation.</P>
<P>Nothing is more common than to hear of the in&s;idien&s;|ne&s;s of France; it has been, and ever will be, the con&s;tant topic of declamation of the good people of this country; but whil&s;t it is &s;o, we cannot but wonder that a private treaty &s;hould be entered into, and that &s;uch treaty &s;hould tend to enable that very power to be more in&s;idious, and &s;hould be entered into immediately after the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the King and Parliament of Great-Britain had demanded of the Congre&s;s&mdash;<Q>Whether they could depend on the word and confidence of that court, <HI>who&s;e in&s;idious interpo&s;ition had, from the &s;ettlement of the colonies, been actuated with enmity to both?</HI></Q>&mdash;The mini&s;ters mu&s;t &s;urely appear very &s;imple, or very in&s;idious them&s;elves, who can negotiate with &s;uch a power in preference to the&s;e, of whom they have no real cau&s;e of di&s;tru&s;t.</P>
<P>No one will put much faith in the Princes of any country. He that tru&s;ts to any thing, but the operation of their in|tere&s;t, is a poor politician; and he that complains of deceit, where there is an intere&s;t to deceive, will ever be con&s;idered as a fool. But if he does complain, let him be careful to avoid the ju&s;tice of a &s;imilar accu&s;ation. France probably laughs at the charge of in&s;idiou&s;ne&s;s, brought again&s;t her by the court of Great-Britain: When it was brought, <HI>ungraci|ou&s;ly</HI> brought, at the beginning of the&s;e troubles, again&s;t America, it excited pity: America, however, who only felt an emotion, mixed with &s;orrow and di&s;dain, when &s;he thought her&s;elf calumniated, expre&s;&s;ed lately the greate&s;t indignation when the in&s;idiou&s;ne&s;s of France was <HI>in&s;idiou&s;ly</HI> alluded to. To America, the conduct of France appears magnanimous and liberal; her offers are at the lea&s;t apparently fair, and equal to her wi&s;hes; in keeping to this appearance there is much political wi&s;dom: But when Great-Britain offers to America every thing but independence, &s;he &s;hews the extreme folly of in&s;idiou&s;ne&s;s; <HI>&s;he gives every thing, only to gain the right and power of retracting every thing.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="016245_0015_0F9BCFB7D382A100">
Let Great-Britain then con&s;ider whether it is not, and ever mu&s;t be, the intere&s;t of France to &s;upport the independence of America; &s;uch con&s;ideration will &s;hew the folly of treat|ing with that power to betray it, that no offers are &s;ufficient to obtain her forbearance, but that &s;he will either directly or indirectly pur&s;ue her great and permanent intere&s;t, by &s;up|porting the Americans in their oppo&s;ition, and inciting other nations to hold up their forbearance likewi&s;e as worthy of purcha&s;e.</P>
<P>But the particular incitement of France again&s;t this coun|try is not nece&s;&s;ary; the very precedent is of it&s;elf &s;ufficient to &s;ugge&s;t to other foreign &s;tates the part to be taken in the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances: The purcha&s;e of peace is a dangerous expedient; it &s;tirs up fre&s;h oppo&s;ition, and opens the door to future mi&s;chief. Should the direct or indirect forbearance of France be actually obtained, it will perhaps be con&s;idered as a great point carried; for her countenance and &s;upport, alone, are &s;ufficient to enable America to &s;et the power of this i&s;land, <HI>even in its mo&s;t flouri&s;hing condition,</HI> at defiance: But there is hardly a Prince in Europe, who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance is not &s;ufficient to determine the die in the <HI>pre&s;ent &s;tate of Briti&s;h affairs;</HI> and there is not one of them who is not &s;en&s;ible of his temporary and comparative &s;trength. Should France, therefore, be quieted, fre&s;h adver&s;aries and fre&s;h claims will ari&s;e in every quarter; every petty Prince, having an intere&s;t in the inde|pendency of America, will expect a &s;atisfaction for giving up his pretences and intere&s;t: Some may be &s;atisfied with a little; but others of great rank, power, and enmity to this country, will make important demands; may make &s;uch as will be eventual &s;acrifices of its honour and intere&s;t, and which, neverthele&s;s, in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of affairs, can|not either in policy or common prudence be refu&s;ed. Is it nece&s;&s;ary to allude to Spain? If the forbearance of France is to be purcha&s;ed on the terms &s;ugge&s;ted by &s;ome, Gibraltar and Jamaica will be moderate prices for the purcha&s;e of peace with Spain. With re&s;pect to the Dutch, there can be no terms offered in &s;atisfaction for their lo&s;s of the American commerce, by the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the former &s;overeignty; for the Dutch value trade above all things.</P>

In &s;hort, it is impo&s;&s;ible for Great-Britain to recover her former &s;overeignty by any treaty with the powers of Europe; for all are intere&s;ted in the independency of America.
