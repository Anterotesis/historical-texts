<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Sin of <HI>ONAN,</HI> and GOD's &s;udden Vengeance upon it, are &s;o remarkable, that every Body will ea&s;ily perceive, that from his Name I have d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">riv'd the running Title of this little Book; and tho' I treat of this Crime in Relation to <HI>Women,</HI> as well as <HI>Men,</HI> whil&s;t the Offence, is <HI>SELF-POLLUTION</HI> in both, I could not think of any other Word which would &s;o well put the Reader in Mind both of the <HI>Sin</HI> and its <HI>Puni&s;hment</HI> at once, as this.</P>
<P>THIS Practice is &s;o frequent, and &s;o crying an Offence, e&s;pecially among the MALE YOUTH of this Nation, that I have Rea&s;on to imagine, a great many Offenders would never have been Guilty of it, if they had been thoroughly acquainted with the Heinou&s;ne&s;s of the Crime, and the &s;ad Con&s;equences to the BODY as well as the SOUL, which may, and often do en&s;ue upon it. This was the chief Motive that induc'd me to write on this Subject.</P>
<P>THOSE who are of Opinion, that notwith&s;tand|ing the Frequency of this Sin, it never ought to be &s;poke of, or hinted at, becau&s;e the bare mentioning of it may be dangerous to &s;ome, who without it, would never have thought of it, I hope will find them&s;elves fully An&s;wer'd.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="002573_0004_0FDB15D5FB7688C0">AND as I am fully per&s;waded, that there are very few Sentences throughout the BOOK, which do not more or le&s;s tend to the Mortification of Lu&s;t, and not one that can give Offence to the cha&s;te&s;t Ear, &s;o I dare recommend the &s;erious Peru&s;al of it to both Sexes: And that it has been look'd upon as In&s;tructive, without being hurtful, (by others as well as my &s;elf,) will appear from the following LETTER &s;ent me by a very Learned and Pious Divine.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of the HEINOUS SIN of <HI>SELF-POLLUTION.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SELF POLLUTION is that unnatural Practice, by which Per&s;ons of either Sex, may defile their own Bodies, without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of others, whil&s;t yielding to filthy Imaginations, they endeavour to imitate and procure to them&s;elves that Sen&s;ation, which God has order'd to attend the carnal Commerce of the two Sexes, for the continuance of our Species.</P>
<P>IT is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to treat of this Subject &s;o as to be under&s;tood by the meane&s;t Capacities, without tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing at the &s;ame time again&s;t the Rules of De|cency, and making U&s;e of Words and Expre&s;&s;ions which Mode&s;ty forbids us to utter. But as my great Aim is to promote Vertue and Chri&s;tian Purity, and to di&s;courage Vice and Uncleanne&s;s, without giving Offence to any, I &s;hall chu&s;e rather to be le&s;s intelli|gible to &s;ome, and leave &s;everal things to the Con&s;i|deration of my Readers, than by being too plain, run the H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">zard of rai&s;ing in &s;ome corrupt Minds, what I would mo&s;t endeavour to &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fie and de&s;troy: And that every Body, who would write profitably again&s;t any &s;ort of Uncleanne&s;s whatever, and not do more
<PB N="2" REF="002573_0008_0FDB15D864813ED0">
Harm than Good by his Endeavours, ought to be very careful and circum&s;pect as to this Particular, we may learn from Bi&s;hop <HI>Taylor</HI> in his Rules and Exerci&s;es of <HI>Holy Living: 'Tis too plain,</HI> &s;ays that Learned Pre|late, <HI>that there are &s;ome Spirits &s;o Athei&s;tical, and &s;ome &s;o wholly po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with a Spirit of Un|cleanne&s;s, that they turn the most prudent and cha&s;te Di&s;cour&s;es into Dirt and filthy Apprehen|&s;ions; like Cholerick Stomachs, changing their very Cordials and Medicines into Bitterne&s;s, and in a literal &s;en&s;e, turning the Grace of God into Wan|tonne&s;s. They &s;tudy Ca&s;es of Con&s;cience</HI> (as he pro|ceeds) <HI>in the Ca&s;e of carnal Sins, not to avoid, but to learn Ways how to offend God, and pollute their own Spirits, and &s;earch their Hou&s;es with a Sun-Beam, that they may be instructed in all the Cor|ners of Nastine&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>I am per&s;waded, that tho&s;e who have defil'd them|&s;elves by this Practice already, or el&s;e by wicked Thoughts are tempted &s;o to do, mu&s;t under&s;tand what I mean by SELF-POLLUTION, as I have defin'd it, without any farther Interpretation. To them it is that I chiefly recommend the&s;e Pages, with my hearty De&s;ire of their mo&s;t &s;erious Con&s;ideration on what is contain'd in them: And as to &s;uch who never con|tracted this Guilt, and being perhaps of &s;mall Expe|rience may be wholly ignorant of the Sin I would warn them again&s;t, I think them happy in their Inno|cence; a&s;&s;uring them withal, that they &s;hall meet here with nothing but what &s;hall more and more in|cite them to Cha&s;tity, and deter them from all man|ner of Uncleanne&s;s.</P>
<P>SELF-POLLUTION we &s;ee remarkably puni&s;h'd in <HI>Onan,</HI> by a particular Stroke from Almighty God, for it is not to be thought that his Guilt lay totally in
<PB N="3" REF="002573_0009_0FDB1622CF073E88">
not rai&s;ing up Seed to his Decea&s;ed Brother <HI>Er,</HI> tho' we'll own that this was an aggravation of it, but the Way he took to prevent it would have been highly culpable at any other Time; and from the Words of the Text, which informs us of this Part of Sacred Hi&s;tory, it is rea&s;onable to imagine, that the greate&s;t Part of the Offence lay in the act of defiling him&s;elf, rather than in the Neglect of his Duty; <HI>the thing which he</HI> Did <HI>di&s;plea&s;ed the Lord, wherefore he &s;lew him al&s;o,</HI> Gen. 38. ver. 10. It was therefore the thing he <HI>Did,</HI> rather than the thing he omitted, which mo&s;t di&s;pleas'd the Lord, as may be further &s;een in, <HI>Deut.</HI> Chap. 25. from ver. 5, <HI>to</HI> 10. Be that as it will, this is certain, that as it was, it prov'd &s;o in|tollerable a Provocation, that Almighty God could not bear with it, and therefore immediately cut him off by Rea&s;on of it.</P>
<P>SOME ea&s;y Ca&s;ui&s;ts notwith&s;tanding the Exem|plary Puni&s;hment that has attended this Sin, have made &s;light of it, and &s;hamefully deceiv'd tho&s;e who con|&s;ulted them, &s;everal of them perhaps to their Ruin. Others, by being too open though &s;evere enough, have treated this matter &s;o gro&s;ly in the learned Lan|guages, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to tran&s;late any part of them, wihout offending Cha&s;tity.</P>
<P>THE Learned <HI>O&s;tervald,</HI> in his u&s;eful Treati&s;e on Uncleanne&s;s in all its Branches, has through an exce&s;s of Mode&s;ty, pa&s;s'd over this abominable Sort of Im|purity in Silence, or at lea&s;t &s;poke of it in &s;uch gene|ral Terms, blending it with le&s;&s;er Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es of Un|cleanne&s;s, that he has fail'd of Repre&s;enting the Hei|nou&s;ne&s;s that is in it. Having hinted at the Sins of <HI>Sodom,</HI> and &s;poke at large of <HI>Adultery</HI> and <HI>Forni|cation,</HI> he adds, <HI>That, be&s;ides tho&s;e, there are many Actions contrary to Mode&s;ty and Chastity, &s;ome
<PB N="4" REF="002573_0010_0FDB15EEAACF1B40">
whereof,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>by the Violence of the Pa&s;&s;ion, and full Con&s;ent of the Will, or by Rea&s;on of the Ma|lignity and Infamy of the Action, almost equal the Crime to which th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y tend; for &s;ome un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ha&s;t Per|&s;ons are hurried by their Lu&s;t, to try in every thing to gratify their Brutal Pa&s;&s;ion, as far as they can conceive to do it, without committing the Fact. But here,</HI> continues he, <HI>I must be very wary, and leave to my Readers, the Trouble of con&s;idering with them|&s;elves, what I may not &s;ay, and apply to all the Actions of Impurity, what I may but ju&s;t touch upon very briefly, and only in general Terms</HI> &mdash; And lower he &s;ays, <HI>Now fora&s;much as I cannot well repeat all tho&s;e Actions which are hurtful to Purity, and yet my Readers may be doubtful of &s;ome of them, and may que&s;tion whether this or that be un|lawful, I &s;hall lay down this one general Rule in this Place, whereby the&s;e Doubts may be ea&s;ily re&s;olv'd. Let Natural Cha&s;tity and Mode&s;ty be first con&s;ul|ted; becau&s;e, provided a Habit of Wickedne&s;s has not quite extingui&s;h'd in us the &s;en&s;e of Modesty, which is natural to us as Men, we &s;hall readily di&s;cern whether an Action be unchaste or no. Next; this principle is to be attended to, that a Chri&s;tian is bound to &s;hun whatever &s;en&s;ualizes the Soul, whatever tends only to &s;atisfie the Pa&s;&s;ions, and whatever is wont to excite them in us, or other.</HI></P>
<P><HI>AND again, Enquiry &s;hould be made what is nece&s;&s;ary, or at lea&s;t, what is expre&s;ly allowed. I &s;ay then, that when&s;oever we are a&s;ham'd of what we do, and dare not venture upon it in the &s;ight of others, when it is only the Effect of a di&s;orderly Pa&s;&s;ion, and aims only at indulging Sen&s;uality, and kindling impure De&s;ires, either in our own, or others Hearts; and when moreover it is neither ne|ce&s;&s;ary nor expre&s;ly allow'd, we &s;hould be &s;ure to ab|stain from it.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="002573_0011_0FDB1627CA412328">THIS is admirable Advice, and excludes not the lea&s;t Act of Impurity; but there is wanting that Hor|ror, with which the Reader ought to be fill'd again&s;t SELF POLLUTION, above other Acts of Unclean|ne&s;s le&s;s criminal. But that this Author only forbore to pronounce his ju&s;t Cen&s;ure again&s;t this &s;ort of Im|purity in particular, for no other Rea&s;on than his be|ing too &s;crupulou&s;ly mode&s;t, is manife&s;t from his own Confe&s;&s;ion, that he was forc'd to be defective in many particulars. <HI>Some Points,</HI> &s;ays he, in his Preface, <HI>&s;hould have been more enlarg'd upon; and &s;ome Ob|jections more particularly con&s;ider'd; but this would have nece&s;&s;itated me to touch up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n &s;ome Things, which Decency forbids. There are al&s;o divers Things, which I am obliged to expre&s;s only in general Terms; others which I dare but ju&s;t hint; and others again that I am forc'd totally to &s;uppre&s;s.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>THERE have been other Ca&s;ui&s;ts again, who treating of this Subject, have been neither too plain, nor too remi&s;s, but by too much Subtilty &s;train'd their Arguments beyond their natural Force, and done an In|jury to Truth and good Sen&s;e, by being too Sophi&s;tical. One of the&s;e having premi&s;ed, that Lu&s;ts of Unclean|ne&s;s are committed fir&s;t with ones &s;elf: Secondly with others, expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in the manner following: <HI>First,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>we will begin with tho&s;e committed with ones &s;elf, which are greater in them&s;elves (ab|&s;tract them from all other Circum&s;tances) than with any other, as Self-Murder is wor&s;e than the Murder of any other; &s;o in and of it &s;elf, this is wor&s;e than polluting of another. For the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ule is, that the Sin that doth break the Order of Love mo&s;t is the worst, Love being the keeping of the Commandments. I mu&s;t not defile my Neighbour, becau&s;e I am to love my Neighbour's Cha&s;tity, but I am to love my &s;elf, and
<PB N="6" REF="002573_0012_0FDB15F0337854A0">
my own Cha&s;tity, before the Cha&s;tity of any el&s;e; and this is a foul Sin, much again&s;t Nature, and there|fore the wor&s;e; for the more unnatural the Sin is, the greater the Guilt is &s;till in that re&s;pect; and whereas it is thought, that there is not that wrong in it, as in taking away the Cha&s;tity of another, I urge it, that there is mo&s;t Wrong when a Man doth Wrong to him&s;elf; and as the Thief doth in the Can|dle, &s;o the&s;e Self-Defilements do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot and weaken the Body by the Cur&s;e of God exceedingly. Be&s;ides, (as in all &s;uch inordinate Practices) there is a &s;ecret kind of Murder, what if not in the intention of the Doer, yet in the Condition of the thing done; wherefore God is much di&s;plea&s;ed with the&s;e kind of Sins.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>TO all the latter Part of the&s;e A&s;&s;ertions I could readily agree; but in the beginning of them this Ca&s;ui&s;t hath been gro&s;ly over&s;een in his way of Rea|&s;oning. The Difference he &s;tates between the Murder of another, and that of ones &s;elf, is very ju&s;t; but then he has forgot to con&s;ider, that that difference cea&s;es, when the Murder of another nece&s;&s;arily includes the Murder of ones &s;elf: Thus by endeavouring to prove too much, his Argument has not proved what it might have done. At this rate, SELF-POLLUTI|ON would be more criminal than the mo&s;t unnatural Abomination with others, which is fal&s;e, becau&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible to defile others without defiling ones &s;elf at the &s;ame time in as high a Degree.</P>
<P>TO condemn and expo&s;e a Sin &s;o di&s;plea&s;ing to God, &s;o detrimental to the Publick, and &s;o injurious to our &s;elves, requires no Flights of Wit, nor any other way of arguing, than what is agreeable to the plaine&s;t Truth, and can &s;tand the Te&s;t of the &s;evere&s;t Rea&s;on. To prove the many Injuries it may do to our &s;elves, as it is the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s of the next Chapter, &s;o I refer
<PB N="7" REF="002573_0013_0FDB1629FB0BFF50">
the Reader to it; and that it is very detrimental to the Publick, will &s;oon appear, if we con&s;ider what is undeniable, that it hinders Marriage, and puts a full &s;top to Procreation. What remains, is to demon&s;trate, that it is di&s;plea&s;ing to God; and that it is &s;o in a very high Degree, is evident both from the Holy Scripture, and our own Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>THERE is not a Place either in the Old or New Te&s;tament, where Uncleanne&s;s, the Lu&s;ts of the Fle&s;h, or the Abominations of <HI>Sodom</HI> are condemn'd, but this Sin is hinted at among others; and there is no doubt, but tho&s;e who are guilty of it, are compre|hended among the Abominable, <HI>who &s;hall have their Part in the Lake, which burneth with Fire and Brimstone,</HI> Rev. 21. v. 8. <HI>What! know ye not,</HI> &s;ays St. <HI>Paul, that your Body is the Temple of the Holy Gho&s;t, which is in you, which you have of God?</HI> And this is a very powerful Con&s;ideration to di&s;&s;wade from Uncleanne&s;s, being taken from the Glory where|to God has rais'd us, even in regard as to our Bodies. They are the Temples of the Holy Spirit, becau&s;e the Holy Spirit dwells in us, and pours forth his Be|nefits upon us, &s;anctifies us, and con&s;ecrates us to the Service of God; wherefore our Bodies partaking of this Honour, we are bound to pre&s;erve them in purity, and to employ them to holy Purpo&s;es; for if the Tem|ples dedicated to the Wor&s;hip of God, may not be prophan'd by any POLLUTION, but mu&s;t be kept pure and undefiled, how great ought the Holine&s;s of our Bodies to be, &s;eeing God has conde&s;cended to make them the Temples of His Holy Spirit? This Reflection of St. <HI>Paul</HI> lets us &s;ee plainly, that when|ever any give them&s;elves over to Uncleanne&s;s, they cea&s;e to be the Temples of the Holy Spirit, ju&s;t as the Apo&s;tle had &s;aid before, that they cea&s;e to

be the Members of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which &s;hews this Sin to be the Occa&s;ion that the Holy Spirit of God withdraws from the Hearts of &s;uch as are guilty of it, becau&s;e his Spirit cannot dwell with POLLUTION. He tells us afterwards in the &s;ame Chapter, <HI>Ye are not your own, for ye are bought with a Price, there|fore glorifie God in your Bodies, and in your Spirits which are God's.</HI></P>
<P>THE &s;ame Apo&s;tle affirms of the Heathens, <HI>that being given up to Uncleanne&s;s, they di&s;honoured their own Bodies between them&s;elves.</HI> And in another Place, <HI>that it is the Will of God, that we ab&s;tain from Uncleanne&s;s.</HI> But it would be endle&s;s to quote all the Texts, which tend to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e. Let any Man examine all the Places of the New Te&s;tament, where mention is made of Vices and Sins, and he will find, there is not any one other Crime &s;o many times named as Uncleanne&s;s; and how can a Per&s;on be more &s;uperlatively unclean, than when he is guilty of SELF-POLLUTION.</P>
<P>BUT if it was not reveal'd to us that God is highly offended at all manner of Uncleanne&s;s; when we reflect on the End of Marriage in all Countries, and in all Societies, and the manner after which God has ordain'd that our Species &s;hould be continu'd, na|tural Religion, and our own Rea&s;on would in|&s;truct us, that to de&s;troy that End, mu&s;t be very offen&s;ive to God, if there is one; for whether we commit Abomination with tho&s;e of our own Sex, as the Scripture &s;ays, <HI>Men with Men;</HI> or with Bea&s;ts; or that we defile our own Bodies our &s;elves with this &s;hameful Action, the Con&s;equences are the &s;ame to the Society and our Species; and what a learned Divine has &s;aid of the fir&s;t, is equally ap|plicable

That this Sin, and all the Mi&s;chiefs that may attend it, are equally ruinous in either Sex, in regard to the civil Society, as well as them&s;elves, &s;hall be demon&s;trated in the following Chapter. In the Remainder of this, I &s;hall examine into the Cau|&s;es of SELF-POLLUTION, and offer &s;ome Thoughts to prevent at lea&s;t the Frequency of it.</P>
<P>I Shall not here meddle with the Cau&s;es of Un|cleanne&s;s in general, &s;uch as <HI>Ill-Books, Bad Compa|nions, Love-Stories, La&s;civious Di&s;cour&s;es,</HI> and other Provocatives to <HI>Lu&s;t</HI> and <HI>Wantonne&s;s;</HI> as the&s;e are &s;ufficiently treated of in mo&s;t Books of Devotion and Practical Divinity, &s;o I refer the Reader to them, and de&s;ign only to &s;peak of tho&s;e peculiar Cau&s;es, which belong to this Sin, and hardly any other.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Cau&s;e is Ignorance: There are Thou|&s;ands among the Youth of both Sexes <HI>Ingenious, Docile, Diligent,</HI> and <HI>Tractable,</HI> who either by the Example of their Intimates; through their own Wan|tonne&s;s; or by being idle and alone; and &s;ome by meer Accident, have learn'd to Pollute them&s;elves
<PB N="10" REF="002573_0016_0FDB15F5D3070478">
after this manner, that would have abhorred the Thoughts, had they under&s;tood the Nature of the Sin, and been acquainted with the Heinou&s;ne&s;s of the Crime. There are likewi&s;e many adult Per&s;ons, both Men and Women, who are guilty of this Sin, and perhaps Reprobates enough to Commit any, as to Religious Fears, that would never have ventur'd upon this, if they had known what Bodily Suff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rings and Infirmities it may be, and often is the Occa&s;ion of.</P>
<P>THE Second, is the Secrecy, with which SELF-POLLUTION may be committed: All other Actions of Uncleanne&s;s mu&s;t have a Witne&s;s, this needs none. Some lu&s;tful Women of Sen&s;e, have made all the outward Shew of Virtue and Morality that can be required; they have had Prudence enough, in the mid&s;t of &s;trong De&s;ires, to refu&s;e di&s;advantageous Matches, and yet have abandon'd them&s;elves to this Vice, when at the &s;ame time, they would rather have died, than betray'd a Weakne&s;s to any Man living, as afterwards becoming Penitents they have confe&s;s'd them&s;elves. And again &s;ome young Men of vicious Inclinations, have either naturally, or for want of a liberal Education, been &s;hamefac'd to Exce&s;s; they have not dar'd to look upon a Woman, and their Ba&s;h|fulne&s;s has &s;ecur'd them from every Act of Impurity, but This. From all which, it is evident, that the Secrecy of this Sin has betray'd many into it, whom hardly any thing el&s;e would have tempted.</P>
<P>THE third and la&s;t Cau&s;e I &s;hall alledge, is Im|punity. Tho' the Laws again&s;t <HI>Fornication</HI> and <HI>A|dultery,</HI> are in many Places either very remi&s;s, or ill executed, yet the Dread of them keeps the fear|ful in Awe. The Puni&s;hment for unnatural Impuri|ties committed with others, is Capital. But the Laws
<PB N="11" REF="002573_0017_0FDB1630EC2E5D20">
are not the only thing which vicious Per&s;ons are afraid of. Some are with-held from Pro&s;titutes by their Covetou&s;ne&s;s only. Others again ab&s;tain from <HI>Fornication</HI> for nothing el&s;e but the fear of Di&s;ea&s;es, or the having of Children. La&s;civious Widows, who under&s;tand the World, have rea&s;on to &s;cruple &s;econd Marriages, on many Ac|counts; &s;ome love their Liberty; others their Mo|ney; and if they value their Reputation, they'll not dare to venture on unlawful Embraces; whereas in SELF-POLLUTION, neither the cautious, nor the covetous, imagine that they have any thing to fear.</P>
<P>IT is not ea&s;y to determine, whether it be more mon&s;trous or unaccountable, that rather than commit a Sin before others, who would be their Accomplices, and uphold them in it, Men &s;hould chu&s;e to be guilty of a greater before God, who has vow'd to revenge it. To &s;ay that this proceeds from <HI>Athei&s;m,</HI> and want of <HI>Faith,</HI> is contrary to Experience, for let us take a thou&s;and People to task, that &s;hall have all been guilty of this or any other the mo&s;t Heinous Crime, and we &s;hall hardly find one, but what will not only acknow|ledge a <HI>Deity,</HI> but likewi&s;e tell us, that he is con|vinc'd of his <HI>Ubiquity</HI> and <HI>Omni&s;cience,</HI> his <HI>Wi&s;dom, Ju&s;tice,</HI> and <HI>Omnipotence,</HI> and that he is ready to &s;ub&s;cribe to every Article of Chri&s;tianity. What can be &s;aid of this, is, that Man contradicts him&s;elf, and acts directly again&s;t his own Principle. What could be more ab&s;urd in humane Affairs, than that a Thief de|&s;igning to &s;teal a Hor&s;e, &s;hould endeavour to &s;hun the Eyes of all the World but the Owners; e&s;pecially if he was fully per&s;waded, that this Owner could catch him whenever he would, and in&s;tict what Puni&s;hment upon him he pleas'd? What Spiritual darkne&s;s mu&s;t &s;urround Man, that &s;hould be &s;tark blind in his great|e&s;t Concerns, and clear &s;ighted only in Trifles? When
<PB N="12" REF="002573_0018_0FDB15F7C2501638">
a Man &s;hews Ba&s;hfulne&s;s, and the utmo&s;t Cowardice to the mo&s;t impotent Wretch of his Fellow Creatures, is it not unconceivable he &s;hould behave him&s;elf with gi|antick Boldne&s;s and Impudence, to affront the Almigh|ty Creator of Heaven and Earth? Yet there is one thing more contradictory &s;till, which is, that at the &s;ame time he'll affect to be thought Brave as to Princi|ple, and a Chri&s;tian as to Religion.</P>
<P>IT is the general Opinion, that the Shamele&s;s are the wor&s;t of People; yet Shame when ill plac'd, has often wrought wor&s;e Effects than the Rever&s;e alone has ever been able to produce. When a Ba&s;tard Infant is found dead, and the Mother lately deliver'd without Witne&s;s, is not able to prove either that &s;he had made Provi&s;ion for it, or during her Pregnancy, imparted the Secret to another be&s;ides the Father, our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Law, without any other Evidence, pre&s;umes the Wo|man to have Murder'd the Child. From whence it is evident the Legi&s;lators mu&s;t have &s;uppos'd that &s;ome Women may have Cruelty enough to commit the ut|mo&s;t unnatural Murder of all, and at the &s;ame time want Courage to bear Shame: But is there no Reme|dy to be found again&s;t this prepo&s;terous Shame? Is it impo&s;&s;ible to imbue Youth with better Notions of it than are commonly received either by <HI>Example</HI> or <HI>In&s;truction?</HI></P>
<P>WOMEN for the generality, are more Ba&s;hful and re&s;erv'd than Men, and there are things that a Man of the &s;tricte&s;t Morals &s;hall not &s;cruple to do in Pub|lick, which yet would &s;hock mo&s;t Women, even after Pro&s;titution: From hence to imagine, that Women are naturally more mode&s;t than Men, is a Mi&s;take; all the Difference between them, depends upon Cu&s;tom and Education; and I am much mi&s;taken, if this great Power of Fa&s;hions and In&s;truction does not point at a
<PB N="13" REF="002573_0019_0FDB16322B30C340">
Remedy, that would be very &s;erviceable again&s;t SELF-POLLUTION. It is a Rule I know among the mo&s;t prudent People, never to mention any thing concern|ing this Vice, to the Youth of either Sex, for fear that either the De&s;ire after Things forbidden, or el&s;e Curio&s;ity it&s;elf, might prompt the Pupils to what per|haps they never might have thought on, had it not been for the too in&s;tructive Caution of the Teachers. But there are other Methods: The In&s;truction of Youth I hint at, &s;hould commence from their Infancy. If Children were &s;trictly forbid, never to touch their Eyes or No&s;e, but with their Handkerchief, and that only upon very urgent Nece&s;&s;ities; if likewi&s;e they &s;aw every Body comply with this Cu&s;tom, and it was counted abominable to touch them with their naked Hards, I can't &s;ee why this might not be &s;o &s;hocking to 'em when grown up, as now the mo&s;t guilty Denuda|tions are to well-bred People.</P>
<P>I Would have the Reader reflect on the Matter I treat of, which differs much from other Points of Mo|rality; for in handling other Topicks, a Man may &s;afely &s;ay whatever he thinks any way advantageous to his De&s;ign; and has nothing to hinder him from rallying together whatever he apprehends nece&s;&s;ary, and propo&s;ing his Arguments in their utmo&s;t Extent and Force, making them as plain as po&s;&s;ible, and an&s;|wering all Difficulties imaginable. But in arguing a|gain&s;t Uncleanne&s;s, e&s;pecially this &s;ort of it, which of all, as it is the mo&s;t loath&s;ome, the &s;ame Liberty is not to be taken, but a Man is extremely confin'd, and is oblig'd to expre&s;s him&s;elf with the utmo&s;t Circum|&s;pection and Caution, for fear of intrenching upon Mode&s;ty; which as I promis'd I would not be Guilty of doing, I &s;hall all along with the greate&s;t &s;trictne&s;s ob&s;erve, as knowing I &s;hould be oblig'd to name &s;ome
<PB N="14" REF="002573_0020_0FDB15F7C50E6730">
Things that might betray my Readers into the remem|brance of what it is much better that they &s;hould for ever forget, as they would not then be able to &s;et &s;uch a watchful Guard upon their Thoughts and Fan|cies, but that &s;ome &s;oul or filthy De&s;ires would in Spight creep in; the lea&s;t imagination only of which, would render them Odious in God's &s;ight, who &s;eeth the Heart, and Delights in none but tho&s;e who are pure and upright there; with which Apology, hoping it will be thought &s;ufficient for what Omi&s;&s;ions and Ob&s;curity I have been guilty of, I conclude this Chapter.</P>

<P>HAVING &s;et forth the Heinou&s;ne&s;s of this Sin in the preceeding Chapter, one might ju&s;tly imagine, that the Impre&s;&s;ion which the Ugline&s;s of Incontinence and Uncleanne&s;s in general there repre|&s;ented mu&s;t make, would not &s;o immediately wear out, as not to &s;ecure, for &s;ome &s;mall time, the Ima|gination even of vicious Per&s;ons again&s;t any &s;light At|tacks of Uncha&s;tity; but there are La&s;civious People of &s;uch corrupt Minds, that at no time excepted, they may be rais'd to impure Thoughts by bare words, without Coherence, and the Names of Parts, even when made u&s;e of in the Di&s;cription of Calamitous Ca&s;es and Nau&s;eous Di&s;ea&s;es; Therefore as I &s;hall be

<P>THE Afflictions which may, and often do fall upon tho&s;e who are or have been guilty of the &s;inful Practice of SELF-POLLUTION, belong either to the Soul or the Body: I &s;hall begin with tho&s;e of the lea&s;t Con|cern. In the fir&s;t place, it manife&s;tly hinders the Growth both in Boys and Girls, and few of either Sex, that in their Youth commit this Sin to exce&s;s for any con&s;iderable time, come ever to that Robu&s;t|ne&s;s or Strength which they would have arriv'd to without it. In Men as well as Boys, the very fir&s;t Attempt of it has often occa&s;ion'd a <HI>Phymo&s;is</HI> in &s;ome, and a <HI>Paraphymo&s;is</HI> in others; I &s;hall not explain the&s;e Terms any further, let it &s;uffice that they are Accidents which are very trouble&s;ome &amp; painful, and may con|tinue to be tormenting for &s;ome time, if not bring on Ulcers and other wor&s;e Symptoms; e&s;pecially if manag'd by raw unskilful People, whom to employ, it is mo&s;t commonly the Fate of young Men, who being con&s;cious of their Guilt, have not the A&s;&s;urance to addre&s;s them&s;elves to Men of Worth and Experi|ence.

<P>THE Rea&s;on why I am not more particular in de&s;cribing the many Calamities and bodily &s;ufferings, which this Practice may be the occa&s;ion of in Women, I hope will be obvious to every Reader that is capable of making Reflections. It would be impo&s;&s;ible to rake into &s;o much Filthine&s;s, as I &s;hould be oblig'd to do, without offending Cha&s;tity. One thing I &s;hall add, ad|dre&s;&s;ing my &s;elf to young Women, who have any E&s;teem for their Honour, and would keep their Repu|tation un&s;potted, which is, that many of them who thus defile their Bodies, by being needle&s;s, or perhaps more fill'd with impure De&s;ires than ordinary, actually deflower them&s;elves, and fooli&s;hly part with that va|luable Badge of their Cha&s;tity and Innocence, which when once lo&s;t, is never to be retriev'd. This may be the fatal Cau&s;e whenever they marry, of endle&s;s Jealou&s;ies and Family-Quarrels, and make their Hus|bands &s;u&s;pect more than they have de&s;erv'd, wrong|fully imagining, that there is but one Way by which Maids may forfeit their Virginity.</P>
<P>THE next evil Con&s;equences to be apprehended from SELF-POLLUTION, are all tho&s;e other Vices which it may lead the way to, and in time be the Occa&s;ion of: Let us once &s;uppo&s;e, what &s;ome raw ignorant People imagine, that this is only a &s;illy Practice, that there is no &s;uch great harm in it, and, if it be a Sin, it is at lea&s;t le&s;s criminal than <HI>Fornication.</HI> Let us, I &s;ay, &s;uppo&s;e this, tho' not grant it, and after that, &s;e|riou&s;ly con&s;ider what Effects this fooli&s;h Trick of Youth

<P>AS we are conceiv'd in Sin, it is impo&s;&s;ible but lu&s;t|ful De&s;ires will now and then ari&s;e, e&s;pecially in young People that are in Health. By the Reluctancy which all innocent Per&s;ons feel again&s;t complying with them, it is ea&s;ily to be di&s;cover'd, that they are evil, and that the more violently they attack us, the more vi|gorou&s;ly we ought to re&s;i&s;t them. While this Con|flict betwixt Lu&s;t and Cha&s;tity la&s;t, we are Proof again&s;t many Temptations, and our Virtue remains trium|phant. But when once we abandon our Guard, and allow tho&s;e wanton Thoughts the Liberty of roving and wandering where-e'er they plea&s;e, and loo&s;e Fancy can lead them, we make the fir&s;t &s;tep to our Undoing; and our Cha&s;tity is always in Danger, as &s;oon as our Dread and great Apprehen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> of lo&s;ing it, is gone.

<P>THE Devil may &s;ugge&s;t to the Haughty and the Ba&s;h|ful, that in SELF-POLLUTION they'll run no Hazard of their Reputation, and that no body in the World &s;hall know it but them&s;elves; and to the Covetous, that they &s;hall lo&s;e nothing by it; or el&s;e repre&s;ent he Impunity of it to the Cautious and Fearful; but he won't tell them that the All-&s;eeing God mu&s;t be a Witne&s;s to an Act, which his Holine&s;s &s;o much abomi|nates, that the greate&s;t Lo&s;s that can be &s;u&s;tain'd, is that of the Divine Favour, which, to Ballance, the Gain of the whole World is not Equivalent? and that eter|nal Damnation infinitely exceeds all Temporal Puni&s;h|ments that can be invented. When the fir&s;t plau&s;ible Sugge&s;tions are once admitted, the latter Con&s;equen|ces, which are at lea&s;t as certain, are not &s;uffered to intrude, or are pre&s;ently &s;hov'd out as trouble&s;ome Companions. But whatever Re&s;ervedne&s;s before o|thers, they may flatter them&s;elves with, whenever the Fact is once committed, if it was but a trifling Sin, they can have no Innocence to boa&s;t of afterwards. The Barrier that fenc'd their Cha&s;tity is broke, and the Enemy to Purity and Holine&s;s makes daily Inroads, and ravages through every Pa&s;&s;age of the conquered Soul.</P>
<P>THE Sen&s;uality of &s;uch, by being the Occa&s;ion of abundance of inordinate Inclinations in them, hurries them on to many In&s;tances of Lewdne&s;s, for &s;atisfying this bruti&s;h Pa&s;&s;ion. But the State of the Soul is chief|ly to be con&s;idered; whil&s;t it is ordinarily po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by lu&s;tful Thoughts and De&s;ires; the uncha&s;t Per&s;on has his Mind rarely free from la&s;civious and &s;hameful Ima|ginations and Fancies, His Heart is a continual

Spring of evil Thoughts, bubling up in it every Mo|ment: So that there needs only the Pre&s;ence of an Object to inflame his De&s;ire.

<P>WHERE this Sin is become habitual, there mu&s;t be a Di&s;ta&s;te to Godline&s;s and Virtue in general, and whatever Wantonne&s;s, ob&s;cene Di&s;cour&s;es, &s;hameful Actions, and fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">thy Repre&s;entations are to be met with, (how cautiou&s;ly &s;oever they may to the World &s;eem to be avoided) are trea&s;ured up with Care, con&s;tantly to feed this Flame of Impurity. For no &s;ooner has Uncleanne&s;s got the Ma&s;tery over the Heart, but forthwith it pur&s;ues the Man every where, and keeps its Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him at all Times, and in all Places. Upon the mo&s;t &s;erious Occa&s;ions, and in the very Acts of Religion, he ever and anon finds him&s;elf tran&s;ported with lu&s;tful Conceptions and De&s;ires, which ince&s;&s;antly follow him, and take up his Thoughts. I &s;hall not need to &s;ay, how great a Part of Mankind find their Mind flag and langui&s;h, and wander from their Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and are full even of wicked Thoughts, when they &s;hould be praying to God, or hearkening to his Word.

following Chapter; whom I entreat to lend his &s;eri|ous Con&s;ideration, on what &s;hall be further &s;aid is this.</P>
<P>THERE are many heinous Offenders, who are har|den'd in Sin, and continue in it and all worldly Enjoy|ments, without relenting; but few go &s;o to their Graves; mo&s;t great Sinners before they die, feel a deep Remor&s;e, and are tormented with the bitter Stings of Con&s;cience, upbraiding them with their Guilt, and repre&s;enting it to them in its true Colours, and mo&s;t frightful Forms. What Com|fort mu&s;t a Man have, in reflecting on the pa&s;t Acti|ons of his Life, who hardly comes to half the Age he might rea&s;onably have expected to arrive at, finds him|&s;elf enervated by the practice of SELF POLLUTION, his Spirits &s;unk, his Body wa&s;ted, and his Strength decay'd; in continual Danger of being forc'd to re&s;ign his impure Breath, upon the lea&s;t Rigour of the Sea|&s;on, or any other &s;mall Accident? What Comfort, I &s;ay, mu&s;t a Man have, when his Crime, repre&s;enting it &s;elf before him, in its mo&s;t gha&s;tly Shape, Con&s;ci|ence &s;hall upbraid him, that by &s;o many repeated Acts of Murder, he has at la&s;t de&s;troy'd him&s;elf before he is Thirty Years of Age, as by my own Experience I have known it the ca&s;e of &s;everal? It &s;uch great Misfortunes happen but &s;eldom, there are other infirmities that may occa&s;ion very di&s;agreeable Reflections. When Per&s;ons of good E&s;tates, in the Flower of their Age, find them&s;elves bereft of their Manhood, and con&s;cious of their Impotence, and the cur&s;ed Cau&s;e of it, are forc'd to decline the mo&s;t advantageous Matches, and without the lea&s;t Hopes of Po&s;terity, remain the Contempt of others, and a Burden to them&s;elves; to which perhaps, the Mortification &s;hall be added, that the Name and Honour of an Ancient Family, extinct with them&s;elves, mu&s;t be for ever buried in Oblivion, whil&s;t the magni|ficent

Seats and venerable Structures of their more vertuous Ance&s;tors, are inherited or pull'd down by Strangers.</P>
<P>OTHERS again, who can't be &s;aid to die without Offspring, have puny ling'ring Children, more brought up by Phy&s;ick than Kitchin Diet, which they are forc'd to leave at Fourteen or Fifteen Years of Age, perhaps younger, without any probability that they &s;hall ever come to Maturity: When Per&s;ons of large Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions have no better Views to turn to, than the&s;e, and withal &s;o much Rea&s;on to lay all the Blame upon them&s;elves, as the frequent practice of SELF-POLLUTION in their Youth, can furni&s;h them with, the Pro&s;pect can be but Melancholick. Some Women likewi&s;e, tho' married to ki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d and fertile Husbands, who through the <HI>vilene&s;s of their Affections,</HI> have <HI>chang'd,</HI> as St. <HI>Paul</HI> ex|pre&s;&s;es it, <HI>the natural u&s;e into that which is again&s;t Nature,</HI> are all their Life-time wi&s;hing for Children in vain; every Year perhaps they change the Air, try all the Baths in <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> and follow the Advice of mo&s;t Phy&s;icians, and yet are either &s;ubject to fre|quent Mi&s;carriages before the Fifth Month, or el&s;e are never impregnated at all. If ever &s;uch Women were guilty of SELF-POLLUTION to Exce&s;s, and are wi&s;e enough to know the Con&s;equences of it, with what Sorrow and Anxieties mu&s;t the Remembrance of it fill them, even when their Troubles are not extend|ed beyond Temporal Affairs? But when once they are touched with the quick Sen&s;e of their heinous Offences to GOD, how mu&s;t the Reflection on the Things I have named confound the Guilty of either Sex? What Aggravations will they not heap on their Crimes, even to their own Imaginations?</P>
<P>LET no Body imagine that the Con&s;equences of this Sin, and all other Acts of Uncleanne&s;s, will be
<PB N="26" REF="002573_0032_0FDB1609B0197230">
le&s;s Calamitous to tho&s;e, whom either the bodily Sufferings and Infirmities I have &s;poken of, never reach, or no Temporal Afflictions make any Impre&s;&s;ion upon, in order to Repentance. Tho&s;e who never feel any Trouble for their Sin, are oftentimes as in&s;en&s;ible of the Puni&s;hments of it, &s;uch Puni&s;hments I mean as befall them by rea&s;on of it in this Life. Sometimes one may perceive the Judgments of GOD hanging o|ver the Heads of the Uncha&s;te, and threatning to fall upon them; &s;ometimes actually and vi&s;ibly pur&s;uing them in their own Per&s;ons, or in their Relations, or Affairs in the World, making them groan under the Mi&s;eries, Sorrows, and divers Evils they have brought upon them&s;elves; and yet we may &s;ee how little Sen&s;e they have of the Rea&s;on, why the&s;e &s;ad Afflicti|ons are laid upon them, and how ready they are to attribute their Misfortune to any other Cau&s;e, rather than to them&s;elves; &s;ome of them continuing in their Security, till the Judgment of GOD &s;eizes them, and they die in their Impenitence, which is the mo&s;t de|plorable and mo&s;t dangerous State a Man can fall into. For &s;o long as the Sinner has a Sen&s;e of his Guilt, and the Vengeance ju&s;tly due to him for it, there is &s;ome hope of him; but when he is come to this Degree of Obduracy, there is very little to be expected from him; for he is then upon the very Brink of Mi&s;ery, and but one Step from everla&s;ting De&s;truction.</P>
<P>FROM what has been &s;aid la&s;t then, it is manife&s;t, that neither our e&s;caping the Bodily Sufferings which &s;o often en&s;ue upon this Crime, nor our in&s;en&s;ibility of the Sin, or the Temporal Puni&s;hments of it, make any Amendment in our Condition; and on the other Side, as evident, from what has been &s;aid before, that the Con&s;equences of this Crime, may on &s;everal Ac|counts render the Reflection on the Cau&s;e of it, mo&s;t

terrible to the Offenders, and excite in them &s;uch an Inconceivable Indignation again&s;t them&s;elves, as (with|out GOD's Mercy) cannot po&s;&s;ibly end but in De&s;pair.</P>
<P>LET us now con&s;ider, once, That the&s;e Pangs of Con&s;cience (terrible as they are) are mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to Repentance, which yet no Body can be &s;ure that it will be accepted. But if tho&s;e Anxieties to be &s;uffer'd on Earth, are mo&s;t frightful to all that will reflect on them, how much more ought the Guilty to &s;tand in awe of tho&s;e other more inevitable, and more intol|lerable Puni&s;hments which are re&s;erv'd for the other Life? The unclean are not always puni&s;h'd in this World, but they will be mo&s;t certainly in the next, unle&s;s they take Care to prevent it, by a timely and hearty Reformation. This the Holy Scripture teaches, as expre&s;ly as may be; <HI>Neither Fornicators,</HI> &s;ays St. <HI>Paul, nor Adulterers, nor the Abominable, &s;hall in|herit the Kingdom of God;</HI> cautioning al&s;o at the &s;ame time, that we don't abu&s;e our &s;elves, nor flatter our &s;elves in this re&s;pect. And the &s;ame Doctrine he repeats, Gal. 5.19, 20, 21. <HI>I have told you before, as I have told you in times pa&s;t, that they who commit &s;uch things, &s;hall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</HI> So Eph. 5.6. <HI>Let no man deceive you with vain words, for becau&s;e of the&s;e things, cometh the wrath of God upon the children of di&s;obedience.</HI> St. <HI>Peter</HI> likewi&s;e, in the 2d Epi&s;t. Chap. 2. ver. 9. declares and proves by many Examples, that <HI>God re&s;erves the Wicked,</HI> and chiefly the carnal and impure, <HI>unto the Day of Judgment, to be puni&s;hed.</HI></P>
<P>THESE are the Con&s;equences of SELF-POLLU|TION; this is that dreadful State to which it brings Men; and the&s;e the Sins into which it drives them, and the Puni&s;hment to which it renders them obnoxi|ous.

And one would think them enough to in&s;pire all Per&s;ons with a Dete&s;tation again&s;t this Vice.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Spiritual and Phy&s;ical Advice to tho&s;e who have injur'd them&s;elves by the abominable Practice of <HI>SELF-POLLUTION.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the foregoing Chapter, it has been prov'd, that the Hurt which either Sex may receive from SELF-POLLUTION, is Corporal as well as Spiritual: But becau&s;e every Body, who but once has committed this Fact, has in a grievous manner offended GOD, and wrong'd his Soul, and many of &s;trong Con&s;titutions may for &s;ome Time have been guilty of this Sin, with|out any con&s;iderable, or at lea&s;t perceptible Harm to their Bodies, yet how to redre&s;s the &s;piritual Injury received, &s;hall be our fir&s;t and chiefe&s;t Care. There is no Chri&s;tian who can be ignorant, that no Pardon can be obtain'd for this as well as other Sins, without Repentance in general; but many are apt to deceive
<PB N="29" REF="002573_0035_0FDB7B0E6A0E4028">
them&s;elves concerning the Nature of Repentance, as not well knowing in what it con&s;i&s;ts; wherefore, it is requi&s;ite I &s;hould &s;ay &s;omething of the Manner after which this Duty ought to be performed, as well as the Nece&s;&s;ity of it.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Branch of Repentance, and the fir&s;t Duty of the polluted, is a Sorrow for what they have done; after this, it is very nece&s;&s;ary that the Sinner &s;hould examine him&s;elf, to know what Principle it ari&s;es from; for if his Sorrow only proceeds from any Cor|poral Affliction, which this Sin already has brought upon him; or the Fear that it may do &s;o in time to come, it is not &s;aving, unle&s;s the Sinner makes a fur|ther Progre&s;s, and improves the Almighty's Cha&s;ti&s;e|ments, to beget in him an unfeign'd Abhorrence of his Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions. Wherefore, the principal Cau&s;e of his Grief mu&s;t be the greatne&s;s of the Sin it &s;elf, and the woful E&s;tate whereinto it brings Men, in relation to GOD and their own Salvation; for it is certain, that no Repentance is acceptable in the &s;ight of GOD, that does not ari&s;e from &s;uch Meditations as the&s;e.</P>
<P>NEITHER is it &s;ufficient to be &s;omewhat grieved and a&s;hamed; but this Grief mu&s;t be affecting, &s;uch as enters deep, and pierces the very Heart, filling it with Sadne&s;s and Remor&s;e, Dete&s;tation and Fear; or if it be not &s;uch at the beginning, it mu&s;t be &s;uch at length. This is above all others the one infallible Mark of a hearty Sorrow, and &s;incere Repentance; that the Sinner finds no longer any Plea&s;ure or Satisfaction in the things he had formerly delighted in, but &s;eeks to with|draw and get out of the way of them, and finds more Comfort in his Sadne&s;s and Tears for them: Some|times tho&s;e that have renounced this and other Sins of Uncleanne&s;s, have turned a&s;ide another way; and be|taken
<PB N="30" REF="002573_0036_0FDB160FC0681C58">
them&s;elves to Plea&s;ures of another Nature. But &s;o long as they retain an Affection for worldly Plea&s;ures and Joys of what&s;oever kind, this is a certain Sign of their not being touch'd with a true Repentance.</P>
<P>BUT above all, Care mu&s;t be taken, that this Grief be la&s;ting; for Mens Sorrow is oftentimes but light at the beginning of their Conver&s;ion, as will ea&s;ily be apprehended, if we but call to mind that there are two &s;orts of Sins. Some there are for which a Man is apt to have an extream Concern, as &s;oon as he ever has committed them, and they are &s;uch as he is not be|trayed into by his own Inclination, nor can take Delight in. Thus, when one has committed Murder, or &s;po|ken Bla&s;phemy, he will perhaps be immediately &s;truct with the Horror of his Crime, and a &s;tinging Re|mor&s;e, by rea&s;on of it. But it is quite otherwi&s;e with tho&s;e Sins into which Men are drawn by Plea&s;ure, and which gratify their Inclinations, and e&s;pecially when they are become habitual. Though they take up a Re|&s;olution of quitting the&s;e, they do not at fir&s;t look up|on 'em with the Aver&s;ion due to them; they could yet plea&s;e them&s;elves with them, and it is not without doing Violence to them&s;elves, and re&s;i&s;ting their own Inclinations, that they get rid of them. So that their Di&s;like of the&s;e &s;orts of Sins is but &s;mall at fir&s;t, the Fire of Lu&s;t not being yet wholly extinct. But the chief Commendation of it, is, that it is la&s;ting. And this is what they ought to have an e&s;pecial regard to, the cau&s;e of mo&s;t Mens Failings in the&s;e Attempts, being, that in time the &s;en&s;e of their Crimes abates, and at la&s;t wears quite away.</P>
<P>THE Repentance of tho&s;e who are polluted by this Sin, or any other &s;ort of Uncleanne&s;s&punc; &s;hould remain with them to their Lives end. The&s;e are not Sins
<PB N="31" REF="002573_0037_0FDB7B10EBF5D860">
which a Man can forget, and the Memory of them ought to be always fre&s;h, that the Penitent may truly &s;ay with <HI>David, My Sins are ever before me.</HI> Not only the time that has pa&s;t &s;ince the Commi&s;&s;ion of it, but even an Amendment of Life does not take away the Sen&s;e of &s;o great a Fault; but on the contrary he becomes more and more &s;en&s;ible of it. Even this Thought, that the Sinner has had the Happine&s;s to obtain the Pardon of his Guilt, will render the Re|membrance of it the more bitter, and the greater Pro|gre&s;s he makes in Holine&s;s, the more abominable will his wickedne&s;s appear. The greater Experience he has had of GOD's Mercy, the more he will accu&s;e and loath him&s;elf; &amp; the more hope he has of Salvation through GOD's Goodne&s;s, the more will he be af|fected with the danger of being excluded from it to which he had expos'd him&s;elf.</P>
<P>ANOTHER great Duty that belongs to Repentance, is Conver&s;ion and Amendment: The Guilty mu&s;t for&s;ake their Sin, and continue no longer in it. When our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour pardon'd the Woman taken in <HI>A|dultery,</HI> he &s;aid to her; <HI>Go and Sin no more.</HI> The Crime mu&s;t therefore be totally renounc'd; and they which do not this, but relap&s;e into it, have not repented of it. Every Act, and every repetition of their Sin is an Aggravation of both their Guilt and Puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>BUT this is but the beginning of Conver&s;ion; and this fir&s;t &s;tep will be to no purpo&s;e, if the Offenders &s;top here; it is not enough to renounce their Crime, without renouncing likewi&s;e all the Approaches to it: All the &s;everal Species of Imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rity, and all the Defile|ments of either Body or Mind; all lewd Actions, wanton Glances, impure Thoughts and De&s;ires, toge|ther with &s;uch Familiarities as expo&s;e to Temptations;

<P>THERE are two Rea&s;ons why it is nece&s;&s;ary to re|nounce all th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e Species of Impurity: Fir&s;t, becau&s;e they will be apt to make Men fall again into the Crime; and then, becau&s;e a true Repentance is incon|&s;i&s;tent with Defi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ment.

<P>IT &s;uffices not barely to fly Impurity, but they likewi&s;e mu&s;t &s;hew forth their Repentance, by a Life of Mortification; and if it be a general Doctrine a|mong Chri&s;tians, not to take Care of the Fle&s;h but to mortify the Body, and keep it under, and bring it into Subjection, none have more rea&s;on for the Ob&s;er|vance of the&s;e Injunctions than tho&s;e whom the Pa&s;|&s;ions of the Fle&s;h have drawn into Sin. A love of Plea&s;ures and compliance with the Fle&s;h, are no where more highly blameable, than in &s;uch as are guilty of Impurity. And it mu&s;t al&s;o be granted, that when

any one is touch'd with a lively Sen&s;e of this Crime, he goes on no longer in que&s;t of his vain Delights, he is not then in a Condition to rejoyce and plea&s;e him|&s;elf, but places his Con&s;olation rather in the Exerci&s;es of Repentance: Diver&s;ions, and frivilous Entertain|ments, reading vain Authors, Dre&s;&s;ing, and the Care of the Body; all the&s;e make but vain Impre&s;&s;ions up|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o him. And on the contrary, when cho&s;e that have been impure and di&s;&s;olute, and who have left off to Sin, as they have grown into Years, do not mortify them&s;elves; when they lo&s;e their Ea&s;e, and make it their &s;tudy to obtain the Plea&s;ures and Advantages of Life, pa&s;&s;ing their time in Idlene&s;s, or at Play, and &s;etting their Minds upon Dainties and &s;umptuous Entertainments, mo&s;t certainly the&s;e are yet in a State of Impenitence, and have never been truly &s;en&s;ible of their Fault, not duly &s;et them&s;elves to make amends for it.</P>
<P>THE Sincerity of Conver&s;ion, mu&s;t not only appear in the things which have relation to Impurity, but in the whole Cour&s;e of their Conver&s;ation. So great a Fall &s;hould render a Man Wi&s;e, Pious, Circum&s;pect in all things: All that is in him is to become new: He would take occa&s;ion from every thing to &s;hew his Re|pentance, to di&s;charge his Duty towards GOD, to edify his Neighbour, and to purify him&s;elf more and more. He ought with the greate&s;t Exactne&s;s and Sin|cerity to practice the Duties of Religion, to give him|&s;elf to Meditation and Prayer, and to be con&s;tant in Holy Exerci&s;es, ca&s;ting him&s;elf, as St. <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> advi&s;es, upon GOD, who will not withdraw him&s;elf from him, nor leave him to fall, but will help him, if he relies upon, and puts confidence in him: There are only two things requir'd of him, one, that he would fir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ly re&s;olve, to make the Glory of GOD, and his own Salvation his chief End, regarding nothing in Compari|&s;on

<P>THO' I am a Stranger to your Per&s;on, yet you have made me not to be a Stranger to your Soul, which indeed I find to be deplorable enough, and there is no Sorrow great enough for it, except &s;uch Sorrow as drives you from GOD: <HI>Exigit au|tem ille dolor plu&s;quam lex ulla dolori conce&s;&s;it.</HI> Let your Anger be infinite again&s;t your Sin, watch again&s;t it with all the Caution that is imaginable, and now that your State is &s;uch, that you can &s;carce Sin any more in that In&s;tance where your Evil lies, &s;hew Zeal and Indignation again&s;t your &s;elf, and judge your &s;elf &s;everely for what is pa&s;t, and while you live never be reconcil'd to your Self, but pray for Pardon perpetually; but then be &s;ure to hope for it Humbly, or el&s;e you can never pray for it acceptably.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NO doubt but you have committed a grievous Sin, and the more becau&s;e you did it know|ingly, frequently, with deliberation, with delight, and again&s;t many Re&s;olutions, (as I perceive) to the
<PB N="38" REF="002573_0044_0FDB161979ADF208">
contrary; and therefore it is but nece&s;&s;ary you &s;hould lay it to Heart, and look upon your &s;elf as an inordinate lover of carnal Plea&s;ure, as one that hath defil'd your own Body, and in &s;ome &s;ort &s;tain'd your Bapti&s;m, offended the Spirit, unhallow'd and de&s;ecrated its Temple, and that de&s;erves to be de|&s;troy'd: Mi&s;take me not, I do not equal your Sin, with that of <HI>Fornication,</HI> concerning which the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks the&s;e dreadful things, but I &s;ay, in &s;ome &s;ort, in a le&s;&s;er degree, you have incurr'd that Guilt, by Fornicating with your &s;elf, and that after you were in&s;tructed, and had purpos'd Amendment; yet all this doth not make your Crime unpardona|ble, but only more difficult to Cure. Sins of Deli|beration, often repeated again&s;t Vows, and with De|light, are very dangerous; but the Danger con&s;i&s;ts in this, that they are hard to be for&s;aken becau&s;e of an habitual Plea&s;ure in them. You will agree, I &s;uppo&s;e, to the Doctrine following, which I take to be infallible.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That there is no Pardon to be hoped for with|out Repentance.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That Repentance is for&s;aking the Sin totally.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That it is abandoning of all Sin what&s;oever.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>That tho' this for&s;aking of Sin, does not make us clean as to what is pa&s;t, yet it has a Promi&s;e of Mercy and Forgivene&s;s annex'd to it, which we can|not fail of,</HI> 1 Joh. 1.7. If we walk in the Light, as he is in the Light, we have Fellow&s;hip one with another, and the Blood of JESUS CHRIST his Son clean&s;eth us from all Sin. <HI>Ob&s;erve that it is from</HI> all <HI>Sin; and likewi&s;e take notice that in the</HI> 9th <HI>Ver&s;e he &s;aith,</HI> GOD is faithful and ju&s;t to forgive us our Sins, and to clean&s;e us from <HI>all</HI> Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s. <HI>From whence no may draw another certain Conclu&s;ion, that Par|don

<P><HI>GOD &s;hould not be ju&s;t, if he &s;hould deny it to &s;uch a Per&s;on &s;uing for it; it con&s;i&s;ts not with his Faithfulne&s;s to with-hold it. Then add this fur|ther, that if Sin be forgiven, GOD mu&s;t needs treat us as his Friends, and u&s;e us as kindly, as if we were in Innocence, for</HI> it is Sin only that makes a Separation between GOD and us. <HI>From whence it follows, that his Spirit, which he has promi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">'d to tho&s;e whom he loves, mu&s;t al&s;o return again, and forget the former Affronts that were offer'd to it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>YOUR first Que&s;tion then is re&s;olv'd, and you may be at peace, if you but for&s;ake this Sin and all others; for you &s;ee,</HI> the Blood of Chri&s;t clean&s;eth us from all Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, when we turn from the Works of Darkne&s;s, and walk in the Light. <HI>And to|gether with our clean&s;ing, the Holy Gho&s;t comes a|gain, and re&s;umes his former Dwelling, which is no more offen&s;ive to him. Now I doubt not but there is a po&s;&s;ibility (though perhaps &s;ome difficulty) of for|&s;aking this Sin, and &s;o becoming the Habitation of GOD, through his Spirit, becau&s;e you have the Spi|rit of GOD in &s;ome of its Operations,</HI> viz. <HI>as the Spirit of Illumination and Understanding, tho' not in all other that belong to it. You di&s;cern and ac|knowledge the Sin, the heinou&s;ne&s;s of it, its evil Con|&s;equents, the Injury it doth to GOD, to his SON and HOLY SPIRIT; I doubt not therefore but the Spirit will further communicate it &s;elf to you, if you will but follow my Advice.</HI></P>

<P>THESE are excellent Advices, and Marriage the chief Preventative, it being an In&s;titution appointed by the Almighty, as a Remedy again&s;t Incontinence, and to pre&s;erve us from the Guilt of Impurity, as well as for the Propagation of our Species; whereby the united Pair may with Honour u&s;e that Freedom with one another, as was by no means lawful for them to do while they were &s;ingle, yet there are Re&s;traints in that State al&s;o.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH I am altogether a Stranger to your Per&s;on, yet having read a little Book of yours, I am become acquainted with your refined Notions, and like what you have &s;aid again&s;t one particular Species of Uncleanne&s;s: I bought your Book in hopes you had &s;aid &s;omething concerning the Married State; what Decorum there mu&s;t be ob&s;erv'd not to defile the Marriage Bed; I wi&s;h you had &s;aid &s;ome|thing more on that Point, for the &s;ake of &s;ome of my own Sex, I have di&s;puted with: They have &s;uch gro&s;s Notions, they imagine the Marriage-Bed can't be defil'd unle&s;s they commit <HI>Adultery.</HI> I fancy, <HI>Sir,</HI> you have finer Thoughts than to think Marriage a Provi&s;ion for the Man's Brutality, therefore I have u&s;ed the Freedom to addre&s;s my &s;elf to you, hoping you will vouch&s;afe to tell me whether I am not right in this Particular. First then&punc; I con&s;ider tho&s;e In|clinations were given for the Continuance of our Spe|cies and no other end, and Marriage in&s;tituted that it might be in a decent regular manner; therefore, <HI>Fornication</HI> was forbid, not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s it is in it &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, but it not making for the Good of Society; 'tis fitter one Man abide by one Woman, that there may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> due Care of the Offsprings Education.

of the Creative Power, and very properly I think you term it Murder. Now what is in &s;elf Evil, Marriage can't make Good, therefore I conclude the Marriage-Bed defil'd, the Man and Wife committing Sin, when the End can't be had for which that Sen|&s;ation was given; for tho' the Man be at all Times capable of Generation, the Woman is not, as when &s;he has Conceiv'd; and when &s;he, accoring to the Cour&s;e of Nature, is past it, it then centers in the Plea&s;ure of Sen&s;e, and is a Frustraneous Abu&s;e of their Bodies, the &s;ame in my Opinion with SELF-POLLUTION and SODOMY.

<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Rea&s;on why in the ONANIA, I did not med|dle with any Part of Uncleanne&s;s relating to the Married-State, is, becau&s;e I always did as I &s;till do con|ceive,
<PB N="53" REF="002573_0059_0FDB7B505004C4E0">
that no Branch of it could have any Affinity with the Sin of ONAN, and con&s;equently was foreign to my Purpo&s;e. But as your ingenious Letter, and the Scruple you &s;eem to labour under, are well worthy of the mo&s;t &s;erious Reflections, I &s;hall endeavour, as far as I am able, to &s;atisfy you in the Particular on which you require my pinion; and in order to it, de&s;ire you to be referr'd to the following An&s;wer.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t Place I am altogether of your Opinion, and think it undeniable, that the Inclinations you hint at were given us for the continuane of our Species, and no other End. Secondly, I am forc'd to allow, that where that End cannot be had, as when the Woman has conceiv'd or by the Cour&s;e of Nature is pa&s;t it, all em|braces are Fru&s;traneous, and can center in nothing but the Plea&s;ure of &s;en&s;e, and I would think my &s;elf oblig'd to &s;ub&s;cribe to all the Con&s;equences you can infer from it, if I was not a&s;&s;ur'd that you are mi&s;taken as to the End of Marriage and the Sinfulne&s;s of <HI>Fornication.</HI> In Re|lation to the latter you imagine that it is forbid, not becau&s;e it is in it &s;elf Evil, but as it is de&s;tructive to the good of Society: This is a dangerous A&s;&s;ertion, and gives too great a handle for <HI>Dei&s;ts</HI> and other <HI>Libertines,</HI> who would per&s;wade the World, that Religion is only a Political Invention, and no farther to be minded, than as it is Beneficial to the Order and Government of Society.</P>
<P>THE only Rule a Chri&s;tian is to walk by, is the Word of God; where his Precept is Plain, we are re&s;train'd from any other Standard of the Lawfulne&s;s or Unlawfulne&s;s of an Action whether it brings a vi&s;ible Good or a vi&s;ible Evil, either to our &s;elves or the Pub|lick. The Ju&s;tice of GOD is as incomprehen&s;ible, as his Mercy. What could, to humane Under&s;tanding, be more innocent than the Eating of an Apple? And yet
<PB N="54" REF="002573_0060_0FDB7B30D261E6F0">
what Crime was ever more &s;everely puni&s;h'd? The Sin of <HI>Adam</HI> was not Luxury, nor Wantonne&s;s, but Di&s;obedience, and con&s;i&s;ted &s;olely in the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of a direct Command of his Creator; that <HI>Fornication</HI> is forbid, is plain from Holy Writ; but why is it for|bid, is Arrogance to determine. When our Notions are too much refin'd, they are apt to lead us into Er|ror. You &s;ay that <HI>Fornication</HI> not making for the good of Society, it is better one Man abide by one Women, that there may be a due care taken of the Offsprings Education: This is as &s;trong an Argument again&s;t <HI>Poligamy,</HI> as it is again&s;t <HI>Fornication,</HI> and therefore is not calculated for the good of Societies in general; for among the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> and tho&s;e Hea|thens who&s;e Religion allows them a Plurality of Wives, there are Nations as Flouri&s;hing and Populous as there are among the Chri&s;tians, and the Neglect of the Offspring is no greater Complaint among them than it is among us. What you add to &s;trengthen your Argument, that to be In&s;trumental to introduce poor Creatures into the World, and not to take Care of them, is to be wor&s;e than the Brutes, I will ea&s;ily grant, but am apt to think, that in &s;aying this, you made not a due Reflection on the true Rea&s;on why <HI>Fornication</HI> among us, is &s;o often the Cau&s;e of this Piece of In|humanity which you ju&s;tly condemn.</P>
<P>MARRIAGE is honourable throughout Chri&s;tendom, not &s;o much on a Religious Account, and becau&s;e it is a State entered into by the In&s;titution of GOD; but chiefly as it is a Fa&s;hion and Cu&s;tom every way countenanc'd and encourag'd by the Laws of the Land, a Formality, which we &s;ee that even tho&s;e of the highe&s;t Rank, Kings and Emperors not excepted, are proud to &s;ubmit to. Among all Ranks and Qua|lities of People, there are Women deeply involved in
<PB N="55" REF="002573_0061_0FDB7B5198DCF1C8">
Sin, and wholly neglectful of almo&s;t every Chri&s;tian Duty; yet tho&s;e of them who are Fa&s;hionable, and would be counted to under&s;tand them&s;elves, will, out of Pride only, without any other Con&s;ideration, al|ways refu&s;e to conver&s;e with any of their Sex, that are openly known to have forfeited their Honour. As by this caution Strumpets are render'd de&s;picable, &s;o becomes their Offspring, and all Ba&s;tards mu&s;t infalli|bly bring Shame and Ignominy, which prove &s;o often fatal to the Lives as well as Fortunes of illegitimate Children. But notwith&s;tanding all this, tho&s;e who are Spurious, and born out of Wedlock, are only infamous in Compari&s;on to tho&s;e who are born in Wedlock from the &s;ame Parents, or others of the &s;ame Degree: The natural Son of a great Prince, will always have the Precedency of the mo&s;t legitimate Child of a Pea|&s;ant; from whence it is plain, that in a Country where one Man was not to be confin'd to one Woman, and no Body was to be Married, the I&s;&s;ue of one Woman would not be le&s;s honourable to the Father, than the I&s;&s;ue of another, and con&s;equently no Man could be aw'd by that Ignominy and Reproach, which with us are certainly the chief, if not the only Cau&s;es of the little Provi&s;ion you complain, is generally made for the Offspring of <HI>Fornication.</HI></P>
<P>IT is not to be imagin'd, that Men or Women &s;hould take le&s;s Care of their Offspring than other Creatures, if they were not diverted from it by a more pre&s;&s;ing Motive than Brutes are capable of acting from. Avarice is &s;ometimes more powerful then the &s;tronge&s;t Ties of Nature; and the Fear of Death it &s;elf, is over|come by the fear of Shame only: However our Pa&s;&s;ions may impo&s;e upon us, Men generally love every Thing for their own &s;akes, and Self love is, con&s;picuous, even in Suicide. The Love of rational Creatures to their
<PB N="56" REF="002573_0062_0FDB7B32C5A246A8">
Children, ari&s;es not &s;o much from a natural In&s;tinct, as is commonly imagin'd, and depends very much on the Delight they take in, and the various Comforts they receive from them; and if we would enter into the true Cau&s;e why illegitimate Children are generally more neglected than others, we mu&s;t compare the Scan|dal of having half a dozen Ba&s;tards, to the Applau&s;e and Credit which People receive from the Education and all the good Qualities of &s;o many lawful Children, and we &s;hall find that it is altogether owing to the Shame &amp; Ignominy of it, occa&s;ion'd by a Cu&s;tom, which never could be introduced in any Society, before Marriage had been Time out of Mind in fa&s;hion among them. I have urged this &s;o far to make it evident, that you are mi&s;taken as to the End of Marriagei; becau&s;e it would be ab&s;urd to imagine that Marriage was in&s;tituted to prevent a Mi&s;chief, which could have no Being, if People did not Marry at all. Marriage then is of a more Sacred Original, and was in&s;tituted for Rea&s;ons more worthy of the Holine&s;s of GOD, than the pro|curing of temporal Felicity, the Good of Society, or any other political Con&s;ideration. Throughout the Scriptures it is manife&s;t, that GOD has no greater A|ver&s;ion to any Thing than Uncleanne&s;s of all Sorts; it would be incon&s;i&s;tent with his Purity, that he &s;hould &s;uffer rational Creatures, made after his own Image, promi&s;cuou&s;ly to mix them&s;elves with one another like brute Bea&s;ts: For this Rea&s;on he has will'd, that one Man &s;hould abide with one Woman, and, <HI>vice ver&s;a,</HI> till the Death of either; and to render this Agreement for Life more &s;olemn, he has honour'd it with that In&s;titution which we call Marriage.</P>
<P>FROM what has been &s;aid, it will ea&s;ily appear, that the mo&s;t palpable End of Matrimony to be trac'd from Holy Writ, is to prevent the Sin of Uncleanne&s;s,

that is, hinder all People in whom Carnal De&s;ires are &s;tirred up, from <HI>Fornication,</HI> SELF-POLLUTION, and other &s;orts of Defilements. From this End of Matrimony I argue thus; Whatever, in&s;tead of pro|moting, is de&s;tructive to the &s;acred End of Marriage, could never be requir'd from us by GOD; but the Forbearance you plead for is &s;uch, <HI>Ergo,</HI> it could never, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> As for In&s;tance, could you imagine that a young lu&s;tful Man, full of Health, after having lain four or five Weeks with a Woman he likes, &s;hould now be more able to re&s;train and curb his carnal Appetites, than he was before he had touchd a Woman? Matrimony at this Rate, in&s;tead of ren|dering People more cha&s;te, would &s;erve rather to whet their Lu&s;t, and prompt them on to all manner of Uncleanne&s;s. If it be objected, that a la&s;ting Sickne&s;s of the Wife, or the long Ab&s;ence of the Husband, to which mo&s;t Military, and all Seafaring Men are &s;ubject, may produce the &s;ame Inconveniency, I an&s;|wer, that there is a great difference between Acci|dents and Misfortunes, that may put a &s;top to the Commerce between a Man and his Wife, and a &s;ettled Ab&s;tinence as it were entail'd on the State of Ma|trimony, and which you imagine all married People ought to comply with. Be&s;ides, the Sickne&s;s of the Wife is a Calamity inflicted by the Hand of GOD on the Husband, as well as her &s;elf, and may &s;erve to put them both in mind of their Duty: And tho&s;e who are expo&s;ed to the Sea, or engag'd in other perilous Enterprizes, may even from thence reap Materials to &s;ubdue Lu&s;t and other di&s;orderly Pa&s;&s;ions; and in the&s;e Ca&s;es, to overcome all Temptation, they &s;hall have the expre&s;s Word of GOD to a&s;&s;i&s;t them: The Hope of everla&s;ting Glory may excite them to the Obedience of the divine Commands, as the Fear of eternal Pu|ni&s;hment may deter them from doing Evil, for whe|ther

the Man or his Wife be Sick or Well, pre&s;ent or far off, the nuptial Vow, till the Death of either &s;e|parates the Union, cannot be broke, and GOD's Command again&s;t Adultery is as plain as it is &s;trict.</P>
<P>BUT what &s;hall we &s;ay to a young Couple, both in Health, that live in Peace and Harmony, and have been a con&s;iderable Time &s;triving to render them&s;elves delightful and endearing to each other? How &s;hall they practice this Forbearance, when every Night, naked, they lie in the &s;ame Bed together, as mo&s;t mean People can make no other Shift? This to &s;ome would be an in&s;upportable Temptation: But what Rea&s;ons, what Inducements, &s;hall make them undergo this &s;evere Ab&s;tinence, or rather excruciate them&s;elves with this intollerable Pennance? What Hope have they to excite them to this extraodinary Piece of Purity, or what can frighten them from an imaginary Sin, again&s;t which there is no expre&s;s Command of GOD? Nay, which way &s;hall they imagine That to be a Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, concerning which the Scriptures are altogether &s;ilent, both Old and New Te&s;tament?</P>
<P>IT is incon&s;i&s;tent with the Goodne&s;s, nay the Ju&s;tice of GOD, that any Action in his Eye &s;hould be &s;o heinous a Sin as Sodomy, and that he either by his Precept, or the Example of Puni&s;hment in others, &s;hould not have warn'd us again&s;t it. There are many Duties incumbent on married People that are expre&s;ly commanded, and not &s;o ea&s;ily ob&s;erv'd: The real Difficulties that may occur in that State, are &s;ufficient; we need not, by being over nice, invent any more.</P>
<P>I Am of your Opinion, that there is a Decorum to be ob&s;erv'd as to the Marriage-Bed, and therefore
<PB N="59" REF="002573_0065_0FDB7B5542E5D240">
think that all Exce&s;&s;es and Indecencies, that are de|&s;tructive either to Health or Cha&s;tity, are Sinful, and from this I have my Warrant from Scripture; but I likewi&s;e think that it cannot actually be defiled with|out a third Per&s;on, and then my Sentiment is, that all &s;hameful Freedoms with others, defile it almo&s;t e|qually with Adultery it &s;elf. The Compliment you de&s;ign me, by fancying that I have finer Thoughts than to think Marriage a Provi&s;ion for the Man's Bru|tality, I cannot accept of, for I &s;incerely believe that State to be a lawful Refuge to all, who from a Fault either of their Con&s;titution or manner of Living, find them&s;elves incapable of remaining &s;ingle without Sin; therefore I would not &s;cruple to call Marriage a Provi&s;ion for Incontinence in either Sex.</P>
<P>BUT I am at a lo&s;s for the meaning of the word Brutality; for if you give this Name to all Embraces in general, you include the mo&s;t Lawful ones, even tho&s;e tending only to Procreation, &amp; then the Expre&s;&s;ion is very injurious; but if you call &s;o all Commerce with Women after they have conceiv'd, or are pa&s;t it, the Word is the mo&s;t improper in the World; for how can that be Brutality, what Brutes are not won't to do?</P>
<P>I WOULD not have you tell me, that what I &s;ay now, &s;hews the Practice to be again&s;t Nature, and that Men, always refining upon their Pa&s;&s;ions, have by their Luxury wrapt the very Bent of their natural Appetites, and &s;o accu&s;tomed them&s;elves to Enormities, which Bea&s;ts them&s;elves are not guilty of. There is a va&s;t dif|ference betwixt irrational Creatures and our own Species; we may often ob&s;erve the &s;ame Operations in both from very different Principles. It is true, that the Females of mo&s;t Brutes never admit the Males all the Time of their Pregnancy. But at the Sea&s;ons
<PB N="60" REF="002573_0066_0FDB7B35DF2DBC38">
when their procreative Appetite &s;timulates them to Coition, &s;uch a Ferment is &s;tirr'd up within them, as Adverti&s;es all Males round them, and &s;ome at a great di&s;tance, of their Salacity. The Females that are af|fected with this, are always capable of being impreg|nated, and without it no Male &s;ollicites them. I need not tell you that our Species is de&s;titute of this Piece of Knowledge; but &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that the very want of this In&s;tinct in Men, is another Argument again&s;t you. For is it to be imagin'd, that GOD &s;hould have denied us a Faculty, (granted to Brutes) if it was of &s;o great a Concern to our eternal Happi|ne&s;s, as this would be, if what you urge was true? Would it not be cla&s;hing with the divine Ju&s;tice, to have made an Action heinou&s;ly Criminal, of which we are not &s;ure whether we commit it or not?</P>
<P>THE Bu&s;ine&s;s of Conception is full of Uncertainty; Many Women, even &s;uch as had been Mothers before, have been impos'd upon by Flatulencies and other Ailments, and thought them&s;elves with Child, and to be Deliver'd, when at la&s;t they have brought forth nothing but Wind; others again have attributed that to Di&s;ea&s;es, for Months together, which has been really owing to their being impregnated, and fallen in Labour before they &s;u&s;pected them&s;elves to be with Child: And in &s;ome the only Sign to be rely'd on that Women have not Conceiv'd, has continu'd to appear regularly all the Time of their Pregnancy. Multitudes of Women likewi&s;e, have had rea&s;on to think them&s;elves pa&s;t Child-bearing, and after that brought fine Children into the World: From whence it is evident, that if what you condemn, was &s;o heinous a Sin as <HI>Sodomy,</HI> and by every Body believed to be &s;uch, Procreation it &s;elf would &s;uffer very much. The Danger of committing &s;o capital a Crime, would render
<PB N="61" REF="002573_0067_0FDB7B5B4DE95EF0">
good People cautious beyond Nece&s;&s;ity. The Uncer|tainty I have &s;poke of, would rai&s;e a thou&s;and Scru|ples to ob&s;truct the nuptial Enjoyments, and the Fear of having conceiv'd already, would in many Ca&s;es hin|der them from conceiving at all.</P>
<P>THERE is in the Hi&s;tory of the Old Te&s;tament like|wi&s;e a Circum&s;tance that &s;eems to make again&s;t you, and which I would have you &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider. If GOD has willed, that Men &s;hould practi&s;e the For|bearance you urge, it is not to be thought that the <HI>Patriarchs,</HI> to whom GOD has from Time to Time revealed him&s;elf in &s;o peculiar a Manner, could have been ignorant of it. <HI>Abraham</HI> then we'll &s;ay was well acquainted with GOD's Will as to this particular; but how comes it, that in this Part of the &s;acred Hi&s;|tory, there is not the lea&s;t Shadow of Rea&s;on to make us believe, that <HI>Abraham</HI> had left off all carnal Com|merce with <HI>Sarah,</HI> when it had ceas'd with her to be after the Manner of Women, but rather the contrary? For had <HI>Abraham</HI> di&s;continued the nuptial Embraces, there is no doubt but he would have acquainted <HI>Sarah</HI> with the Rea&s;on of it, which alone would have been &s;ufficient Ground for her Disbelief, when the <HI>Angel</HI> foretold that &s;he was to a have Son. She knew that when &s;he was young, and her Husband likewi&s;e in the Prime of his Age, and there was no vi&s;ible Impediment why &s;he &s;hould have no Children, &s;he had all along re|main'd infertile, which made her wonder how &s;he &s;hould now conceive, when &s;he had &s;uch manife&s;t To|kens of being pa&s;t Child-bearing, and her Husband was of a declining Age, and his Vigour much dimini&s;hed. It was this that provoked her Laughter; &s;he was far from reflecting on the Forbearance of <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Benevolence, and &s;eemed rather, when &s;he laughed, con&s;cious of the many fruitle&s;s Endeavours they had
<PB N="62" REF="002573_0068_0FDB7B3D409961A0">
made &s;ince their Youth. It is likewi&s;e to be ob&s;erved, that when <HI>Sarah</HI> &s;aid that her Lord was <HI>likewi&s;e</HI> Old, &s;he could not mean that he was impotent by Age, and incapable of performing the conjugal Rites: The contrary appeared after <HI>Sarah</HI>'s Death; for he marri|ed another Wife, and had at lea&s;t &s;ix Children by her, &s;o that &s;he only called him Old in re&s;pect to his fir&s;t Vigour, which certainly was decreas'd.</P>
<P>BESIDES, if <HI>Sarah</HI> had the lea&s;t Su&s;picion that it was a Sin for Men to meddle with their Wives after they were pa&s;t Child-bearing, &s;he would never have alledged, as a Rea&s;on of her Unbelief, that her Lord <HI>likewi&s;e</HI> was Old; for if the Act it &s;elf had been an Indecency, a Thing never practis'd, what had it &s;ignified whether <HI>Abraham</HI> was Old or Young?</P>
<P>WHEN in the beginning of this LETTER, I allowed the Embraces you condemn to be fru&s;traneous, I would only be under&s;tood as to Procreation; for el&s;e it is ma|nife&s;t they are of great u&s;e to Society: They are the Bond of conjugal Amity, and by their means a thou|&s;and little Differences and petty Quarrels are made up between a Man and his Wife, which without them would become wide Breaches, and often render the married Couple for ever irreconcileable. That (as you &s;ay) they only center in the Plea&s;ure of Sen&s;e, is true, but &s;o does Mu&s;ick, yet it is not forbid us. What I &s;ay of SELF-POLLUTION, you would apply to this, which is wrong. SELF-POLLUTION is not Murder, becau&s;e what is wa&s;ted might prove a Child; if it were, all nocturnal POLLUTIONS, which no Body can prevent, would be &s;o many Murders: But becau&s;e the Seed is wa&s;ted in a &s;inful Manner, it is a Crime, which GOD has puni&s;h'd with Death. This ought not to be confounded with an Action which GOD allows of, if not encourages.</P>
