<HEAD>COPY of a LETTER by a Gentleman in <HI>New-England,</HI> to his Friend &amp; Corre&s;pondent at <HI>London,</HI> containing REMARKS on a late Pamphlet Entituled, <HI>Some Con&s;iderations on the French Settling Colonies on the</HI> Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, in &s;o far as concerns the Court of Admiralty within the Limits of Col. <HI>SHUTES</HI> Govern|ment in <HI>New-England.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Acknowlege it was a mo&s;t Valuable pre&s;ent you &s;ent me by the la&s;t Ships, for which I &s;hall ever account my &s;elf &s;ingularly obliged: We in this Country being in great mea&s;ure igno|rant of, and anxious to know what pa&s;&s;eth a|mong you in <HI>London</HI> concerning Us, in the&s;e Remote Parts of the World, e&s;pecially in the Winter Sea&s;on; yea and fond of all New Occurrences. A|mid&s;t the other Papers and Pamphlets, That Entitu|led, <HI>Some Con&s;iderations on the French Settling Colonies on the</HI> Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi; was what I did Read mo&s;t delibe|rately, expecting. The Advantages or Di&s;advantages that might thereby accrue to the Dominions of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> would have been &s;et in a clear light. But after all, I ob&s;erve, What was written therein with re|ference to that Settlement, was the Work of &s;ome Fran|tick and Self-conceited Scribler: That Subject being treated of much more accurately in <HI>&s;ome of the Other</HI> Papers: and that the Author had embraced that In|&s;cription or Title to his Pamphlet, As a convenient way to Publi&s;h the A&s;per&s;ions and Reflections which he had in View, not only again&s;t Col. <HI>SHUTE</HI> the
<PB N="2" REF="039720_0002_1015824921937198">Governour and Vice Admiral of <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay</HI> &amp;c. in <HI>New-England,</HI> and the whole Officers of the Court of Admiralty therein e&s;tabli&s;hed; but al&s;o again&s;t the <HI>Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners</HI> for executing the Office of Lord High Admiral of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and which are contained therein, Namely, <HI>That he had given to their Lord&s;hips &s;ome grounds of Complaints</HI> (as he calls them) <HI>again&s;t Col.</HI> SHUTE <HI>the Governour, Master</HI> Menzeis <HI>the Judge, and other Offcers of that Court of Admiralty, and which their Lord&s;hips had not allowed to be Read.</HI> &amp;c. And becau&s;e you are de&s;irous to be informed, What truth is in the&s;e Sugge&s;tions, and that I incline to continue a Corre&s;pondence with you, I &s;hall give you as far as I have been capable to ob&s;erve, not only my own thought, but al&s;o the general Sentiment of the Coun|try concerning the&s;e Reflections Publi&s;hed by that Au|thor under Mask, and yet not &s;o cunningly &s;creened, as not to be known who he is, or (at lea&s;t) whom he Per&s;onats; and you may depend upon it, I &s;hall ad|vance nothing herein, but what can be made plain by Vouchers. <HI>Omni exceptione majores:</HI> if nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>I &s;hall pa&s;s by what therein concerns the Right Ho|nourable the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners of Admiralty, it being beyond doubt in this place, That if the Author have per&s;evered in his <HI>Delirium,</HI> and di&s;covered him|&s;elf to their Lord&s;hips, he hath received his ju&s;t re|ward from them. Neither &s;hall I in&s;i&s;t on a Vindi|cation of Col. <HI>SHUTE,</HI> who&s;e Wi&s;e and Prudent Conduct in all the &s;teps of His Admini&s;tration a|mong&s;t us, is &s;o firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed, as puts him beyond the reach of Malice, and &s;ufficiently able to clear him|&s;elf of all the&s;e fal&s;e Accu&s;ations charged upon him: And I pre&s;ume hath already done it to their Lord&s;hips of the Admiralties &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Judge,</HI> Regi&s;ter and Mar&s;hall of the Court of Admiralty in this Province: In regard the Charge
<PB N="3" REF="039720_0003_10158255EF00B700">again&s;t the <HI>Judge</HI> con&s;i&s;ts of &s;undry Articles, and of weight (if true) That I might be able to an&s;wer fully your de&s;ire, by a ju&s;t &amp; true account of the&s;e Matters, I have not depended on, my own private knowlege and opinion of that Gentleman; tho' I have endeavoured very narrowly to ob&s;erve his deportment in that Sta|tion ever &s;ince he came into the Country, and could not di&s;cover any failour therein tho' frequently con|ver&s;ant with him. And I may to you &s;ay, I would with as much plea&s;ure have Publi&s;hed any blemi&s;hes in him, as any others, if I had ob&s;erved any thing in his Conduct blame-worthy. But I have al&s;o at &s;un|dry times taken occa&s;ion to Di&s;cour&s;e with &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Per&s;ons in this Town, Such as Judges, Ju&s;tices, Coun&s;ellours, Church-Men, Lawyers and Merchants, not a few, that I might have their Sentiments of him: Who&s;e Te&s;timonies do all agree in this, That he behaves him&s;elf very Prudently and Di&s;creetly; is a firm adherer to His Maje&s;ty's Inter|e&s;t, as by Law e&s;tabli&s;hed, a Lover &amp; Promoter of the improvement of the Country: And that as his Station affords him opportunity, he gives &s;ufficient proof of his Qualifications; and was never tainted with being guilty of any of the Articles wherewith that Pam|phleteer charges him. And moreover, the Articles of Charge are by the generality of Re&s;identers in this Town con&s;idered as the Invention of One Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> who was &s;ome time ago Advocate General in that Court, and the produce of his Vindictive Malice and Pa&s;&s;ion, in regard the <HI>Judge</HI> by advice of the <HI>Governour</HI> had &s;u&s;pended him <HI>ab Officio,</HI> for his rude &amp; unbecom|ing behaviour in Court toward the <HI>Judge,</HI> the <HI>Lawyers,</HI> and others Members of Court; yea, and Scurrolous Lan|guage to a great many of the Leidges re&s;orting thereto. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And who thereupon (as I am credibly informed) Swore to be Revenged on him; and now (as it &s;eems) hath taken this Method, if po&s;&s;ible to defame, and &s;o to accompli&s;h his pernicious de&s;ign again&s;t him.
<PB N="4" REF="039720_0004_1015824AA89ABEB0">Neither have I relyed wholly on the above-mentioned Te&s;timonies, and my own proper knowledge of the <HI>Judge,</HI> but proceeded and obtained particular Informa|tion of the &s;everal Ca&s;es mentioned in the Pamphlet, and of the <HI>Judges</HI> actings in the&s;e Ca&s;es; And after a mo&s;t &s;trict inquiry and exact &s;crutiny concerning the &s;ame; I ob&s;erved as follows: And therefore that I may give you an impartial account of his actings therein, and do him ju&s;tice in the ca&s;e, albeit his opi|nion and decrees did not always &s;uit with my intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Whereas in Page 33 of that Pamphlet it is &s;aid, <HI>The Judge was unwilling to proceed in the Governours ab&s;ence on the tryal of Capt.</HI> Smart <HI>&s;eizour, until he got a promi&s;e of Forty Pounds, a Hog&s;head of Claret, and a Cask of Bran|dy; and that then he gave decree, and allowed all to be di&s;po&s;ed of by the Captain, for his Maje&s;ty's u&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>I have ob&s;erved from the Records of Court, that any &s;mall delay therein, was occa&s;ioned by the Captains, not producing of the Writts found in the&s;e Ve&s;&s;els, when &s;eized. And that the Court was continued and Twenty-four Hours allowed that the&s;e wri|tings might be produced in Court as the Laws directs. I al&s;o endeavoured by all means po&s;&s;ible to di&s;cover if with Capt. <HI>Smart,</HI> or any other Per&s;on, the <HI>Judge</HI> had in that ca&s;e or any other ca&s;e made bargain for the Fees or Co&s;ts of Court before Sentence; or was in u&s;e to defer pronouncing of his decrees on any &s;uch ac|count; and could not find &s;o much as one &s;ingle Per|&s;on either in Town or Country to a&s;&s;ert it as true, or &s;o much as to &s;ay, They had at any time heard it al|ledged again&s;t him. And I al&s;o ob&s;erved, That the <HI>Judge</HI> in that ca&s;e of Capt. <HI>Smarts</HI> had exacted no more for the dues of Court than is allowed by Act of Par|liament. 6. <HI>Anne Cap. ult.</HI> And which was divided as the Law directs. As to the Hog&s;head of Claret and Cask of Brandy, mentioned. I ob&s;erved, That &s;ome|time
<PB N="5" REF="039720_0005_1015825A254970D0">after the tryal was over, and Capt. <HI>Smart</HI> had got the decree, and was di&s;po&s;ing upon his Wines, he made Pre&s;ents of &s;ome Part thereof to his friends and acquaintance in the Town, that commodity being &s;omewhat rare in this Place; and among&s;t others be &s;ent to the <HI>Judge</HI> his Hou&s;e a Hog&s;head of Claret; and to the others &s;ome more, &s;ome le&s;s, as he thought pro|per to be&s;tow. As to the Brandy, The Author of the Pamphlet can find out what way it went if he plea&s;e, for the Vapors thereof &s;eem as yet to affect his brain.</P>
<P>Whereas in Page 57 the <HI>Judge</HI> is charged with Ig|norance of the Maritime Laws, and Unintelligible kind of Speech. I ob&s;erve the Judges and Lawyers here are of a contrary opinion: As al&s;o I have occa&s;i|onally &s;een his Act of Admi&s;&s;ion as a Barri&s;ter in <HI>Scot|land,</HI> which te&s;tifyeth, That he is a Gentleman who after a &s;olemn tryal upon the Civil Law, which I pre|&s;ume comprehends the Maritime Law, Many Years ago, was found &s;ufficiently qualified; which you may ea&s;ily be informed of where you are, by His Maje&s;ty's Advocate for <HI>North Britain,</HI> or other Gentlemen of that Country. And whereas it is In&s;inuated in the &s;ame Page, <HI>That the Judge is guilty of Corruption, and in most Ca&s;es frames his deci&s;ions in favour of the highe&s;t bidder.</HI> The Author, I ob&s;erve, is at a lo&s;s in not ha|ving &s;pecial In&s;tances to conde&s;cend on, For I have with great application endeavoured to find out if there was any &s;uch thing true in Fact, and have not been able to di&s;cover any ca&s;e that had the lea&s;t tendency thereto: And the be&s;t and mo&s;t eminent in this Place will readily a&s;&s;ert his Innocence and Vindicate him from that A&s;per&s;ion. And as to the Story contained in that Book or Pamphlet of the <HI>Judge</HI> his having ta|ken one Whale as co&s;ts of Court, for dividing another between two contending Parties: It is altogether Chi|merical, without any &s;hadow of foundation, hatched by the Author.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="039720_0006_1015824E0E5BC800">
As to the acquittal of the Ship called King <HI>GEORGE</HI> mentioned, Page 58, unju&s;tly (as is alledged) <HI>when brought to tryal for Unlawful Importation of Iron, French Brandy &amp; Iri&s;h Prizes, Anno</HI> 1718. <HI>And that for pronouncing the decree</HI> Ab&s;olvitor; <HI>the Judge received a&s;&s;ignment to two Servants time, valued at</HI> 22 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> each. It con&s;i&s;ts with my own proper knowledge, That the deci&s;ion in that ca&s;e made a little noi&s;e, &amp; the Informers alleadged, That Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> the then Advocate General had not done his part fairly; but however be that as it will, I al&s;o know that the <HI>Judge</HI> did <HI>exincontinenti,</HI> order the pro|ceedings in that ca&s;e to be exemplified, and the exem|plification thereof tran&s;mitted to the Lords of Admi|ralty, that their Lord&s;hips might be apprized with the circum&s;tances of that Ca&s;e; which accordingly was done, and neither have the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners ex|pre&s;&s;ed their di&s;like of that Sentence, nor hath the Informer obtained the decree to be rever&s;ed, which he had &s;ufficient time and opportunity to have done, either by Appeal or Review, if the decree had been unju&s;t. And as to the two Servants time mentioned in the Article, I mu&s;t &s;ay the Author &s;peaks without Book: For I have di&s;cour&s;ed the Merchants who had the di&s;po&s;al of the&s;e Servants time; they are Men of good Credit, and I pre&s;ume well known to the late Advocate General, Who are ready if called thereto to make Oath that the <HI>Judge</HI> payed 32 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> in Province Bills for them, which was the full Value, as others of the like kind were Sold.</P>
<P>And whereas the Pampleteer goes on and per&s;i&s;ts in a Billin&s;gate way of arguing, <HI>That the Judge his con|duct is unbecoming, and incon&s;i&s;tant with the Character of an Upright Judge in &s;o far as he &s;olicits and draws vex|atious Suits before him, for the &s;ake of Co&s;ts, and encourages Attorneys,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>To create Quarrels between Sailors and Ma&s;ters, and gives advice to Parties, both before &amp; during tryal, how to proceed, and altering the Sentences after pro|nounced, upon applications made to him.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="039720_0007_1015825D39DAAB40">
I have to a Nicity &s;earched for the Truth of the&s;e bold and arrogant Allegations, and all I can inform you of is that every branch of the&s;e A&s;&s;ertions are void of proof, unle&s;s it be taken for granted upon the Pam|phleteers word: But I ob&s;erved in the cour&s;e of my &s;earch that Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> when Advocate General, did in|deavour to Propogate &s;uch Practices, and to take Money from both Parties, which how &s;oon di&s;covered was one of the Motives that induced the <HI>Judge</HI> to Su&s;pend him.</P>
<P>Whereas in Page 59, it is &s;aid, <HI>That the Court is made up of &s;uch Members, with whom one hone&s;t Man would think it a Scandal to act in Society.</HI></P>
<P>All I &s;hall &s;ay is, That the Author it &s;eems is not as yet informed, That Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> the <HI>bane</HI> thereof, whil&s;t Advocate General therein is now turned out of that Society, for the cau&s;es mentioned in the decree of Su&s;pen&s;ion pronounced again&s;t him; and an other Gentleman much more de&s;erving put in his Place, by Commi&s;&s;ion under the Great Seal of Admiralty. So that he mu&s;t be altogether a Stranger to the Members of that Court as now Con&s;tituted, (or not <HI>Compos Mentis</HI>) who talks &s;o of them.</P>
<P>As to the Regi&s;ter of Court, all I &s;hall inform you of, is, He is a very ingenious Gentleman, of plea&s;ant Conver&s;ation, behaves very well in his Office, and mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous in his application, and gives great di&s;|patch in all ca&s;es to the Satisfaction of all Parties except to Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> when a Member of that Court, by whom he would not be impo&s;ed upon: and who as I formerly repre&s;ented to you is of all Men the mo&s;t Un&s;atisfiable, where his Notions, however ab|&s;urd are not received and acquie&s;&s;ed in as Maxims of Law. And albeit it be true, That the Regi&s;ter is al&s;o
<PB N="8" REF="039720_0008_10156642AEF97788">Secretary to Col. <HI>SHUTE</HI> the Governour; I can|not ob&s;erve any inconveniency to the Leidges that way, for it is mo&s;t certain the Governour doth not in any Manner take upon him to divert or influence him in the Sation as Regi&s;ter of Admiralty; and the Regi&s;ter is capable and hath time abundantly to execute both Tru&s;ts.</P>
<P>As to the Mar&s;hal of Court, He was about twelve Months ago al&s;o an Officer of the Cu&s;toms by Com|mi&s;&s;ion from thence, which being Notified to the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners of Admiralty, Their Lord&s;hips did con&s;ider the&s;e two Offices as incompatable in One Per&s;on, and therefore required the Governour to call for &amp; intimate to him their Lord&s;hips plea&s;ure, <HI>viz.</HI> That he &s;hould make choice of one of the&s;e &amp; abandon the other: This was complyed with, and he made his election to retain the Mar&s;hals Commi&s;&s;ion, &amp; hath ever &s;ince acted as &s;uch, without having any com|plaints laid in Court again&s;t him, for mi&s;demea|nour or unwarrantable exactions.</P>
<P><HI>To Conclude,</HI> I ob&s;erve, and cannot in ju&s;tice to the <HI>Judge,</HI> The other Members of Court, and Leidges who are concerned in Ca&s;es brought before it, forbear to declare, That &s;ince Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> was laid a&s;ide, bu&s;ine&s;s is carried on with great Moderation &amp; Di&s;patch, <HI>&s;ine &s;trepitu</HI> as the Law directs; whereas whil&s;t he was one of the Members of that Society it was much other|ways.</P>
