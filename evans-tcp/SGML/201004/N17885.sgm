<P>THE following Letters have long lain by the author in a &s;tate of neglect; indeed of uncertainty whether the publi|cation of them would do any credit to him&s;elf, or &s;ervice to the world. Nor does he think, that he &s;hould ever have pre&s;umed to expo&s;e them before the for|midable tribunal of the public, unle&s;s animated by the name of the very exalt|ed and amiable per&s;onage, to whom they are addre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>If they de&s;erve no fame, they ought, however, in his opinion, to be branded with no malignant or invidious cen&s;ure, as their intention is really to &s;erve the faire&s;t and mo&s;t amiable part of the cre|ation; to rou&s;e young ladies from a va|cant or in&s;ipid life, into one of u&s;efulne&s;s, and laudable exertion&mdash;to recall them

<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE encouragement of every thing virtuous and laudable has been a di&s;tingui&s;hing character|i&s;tic of your reign; and if licentiou&s;ne&s;s and vice have infe&s;ted the kingdom, it is not becau&s;e they have received any countenance from your &s;ove|reign authority, or even wanted its mo&s;t &s;alutary re&s;traints and pointed oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>To your own &s;ex, in particular, you have exhib|ited a mo&s;t in&s;tructive and animating example.&mdash; You have taught them by a &s;ilent, but impre&s;&s;ive
<PB N="x" REF="023176_0007_0FBDE290EB14B790">language, to depend more for real influence and e&s;teem, on the mild, the &s;oft, and the attractive graces, than on all the peri&s;hable appendages of greatne&s;s, illu&s;trious birth, political interference, or even the dazzling &s;plendours of a throne.</P>
<P>In an age, when artificial gaieties have almo&s;t bani&s;hed the &s;weeter plea&s;ures of &s;implicity and nature you have di&s;played as great a fondne&s;s, as the nece&s;&s;ary avocations of royalty would permit, for dome&s;tic <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">rement. Fa&s;hionable mothers might have derived a le&s;&s;on from your con|duct. Your royal brea&s;t has appeared to vibrate with a more exqui&s;ite delight, to the care&s;&s;es of a tender offspring, in the &s;hades of Wind&s;or, than it ever received from crowded levees, or the &s;uperb|e&s;t brilliance of a court.</P>
<P>In a period of fal&s;e refinement, when conjugal fidelity has not appeared a favourite virtue, your Maje&s;ty has been a model of as delicate an attach|ment, as ever graced the pure&s;t ages of antiquity, or occurs in the voluminous annals of the world. And in an era of fa&s;tidious affluence, when Cri&s;ti|anity has been undermined by the &s;ubtilty of &s;cep|ties, and &s;till more di&s;graced by the lukewarm|ne&s;s and irregularities of its profe&s;&s;ors; when its grand bulwark, the chri&s;tian &s;abbath, has been dar|ingly attacked, particularly among&s;t the higher ranks of people, by many kinds of licentious a|mu&s;ement, you have done every thing in co-opera|tion with our beloved Monarch, to &s;top the pro|gre&s;s of the evil, that could re&s;ult from virtuous precepts, or the un&s;ullied lu&s;tre of example.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="023176_0008_0FBDE2926644D448">
Amid&s;t this <HI>general</HI> a&s;&s;emblage of virtues, there is one point, however, in which your Maje&s;ty's character &s;hines forth with <HI>peculiar</HI> lu&s;tre, and will command the grateful veneration of the mo&s;t di&s;|tant po&s;terity. It is that, which is particularly en|forced in this work, and &s;o clo&s;ely interwoven with the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential intere&s;t of &s;ociety&mdash;female education. This, your Maje&s;ty is allowed to have &s;tudied with greater earne&s;tne&s;s than any woman throughout your domi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ions; I may add, with bet|ter &s;ucce&s;s. Your royal daughters are a daily <HI>liv|ing</HI> comment on the excellence of your in&s;tructions, and are infinitely more celebrated for the graces of their hearts, the elegance of their manners, and the improvement of their under&s;tanding, than the magnificence of their family, or the &s;plendour of their birth.</P>
<P>I cannot, therefore, but be deeply &s;en&s;ible of the high honour, that was conferred on me, when your Maje&s;ty conde&s;cended to look into this work in manu&s;cript, and give me the unre&s;erved privi|lege of in&s;cribing it to your protection; and I would take a re&s;pectful leave of your Maje&s;ty with uttering an earne&s;t wi&s;h, which, elevated as you are, mu&s;t come near the heart&mdash;that the daughters you have cultivated with &s;uch a tender a&s;&s;iduity, may long continue (what they <HI>are,</HI>) the ornament of their &s;ex&mdash;of their kingdom&mdash;of Europe&mdash;the prop, when &s;he wants it, of their declining parent; your con&s;olers in that awful moment, when even Maje&s;ty mu&s;t be du&s;t, and your companions in that heaven, where the virtues will remain, though ti|tles and greatne&s;s and di&s;tinctions are forgotten!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I. To MISS LUCY &mdash;</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR LUCY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH I my&s;elf have &s;u&s;tained an heavy lo&s;s by the death of your excellent mother, who lived &s;o much in my friend&s;hip and e&s;teem, and by her letters and &s;ociety had conferred upon me &s;ome of the &s;weete&s;t plea&s;ures in human life, yet you alas! are the principal &s;ufferer by this afflict|ing di&s;pen&s;ation. It would give me the &s;incere&s;t plea&s;ure, if I knew how to alleviate your grief, or afford you a &s;ingle moment's con&s;olation.</P>
<P>I need not pre&s;s on you the doctrines of religion. You have, doubtle&s;s, con&s;idered who it is, that has deprived you of this invaluable parent; a God of infinite wi&s;dom, who never &s;trikes, but at the &s;itte&s;t moment; a God of equal goodne&s;s, who without the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;ons, would not afflict,
<PB N="2" REF="023176_0011_0FBDE297AF216248">and a being of unbounded power, who is abund|antly able to make up your lo&s;s, and open to you a thou&s;and &s;ources of comfort.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tianity &s;hould exclude all <HI>unrea&s;onable</HI> &s;or|row. If we believe that our friends are dead in God; we know that this life is only a vapour; that our &s;eparation is but for a moment, and that we &s;hall &s;oon be re&s;tored to them in a world, where life is without pain, and where friend&s;hip is im|mortal.</P>
<P>Though you are, in the <HI>literal</HI> &s;en&s;e, an orphan, yet the number of friends, to whom you are &s;o ju&s;tly dear, will render your &s;ituation neither &s;oli|tary, nor defencele&s;s. The &s;en&s;ible, the elegant and the good will think them&s;elves honoured by your acquaintance. They will give you credit for inheriting all the amiable qualities of a mother, who was revered, as far as known, whil&s;t nature has &s;o &s;trongly imprinted, on your face, the re&s;em|blance of her features.</P>
<P>The &s;cene is &s;till fre&s;h upon my memory, when, in her la&s;t moments, &s;he &s;o &s;trongly recommended you to my protection. And though &s;he paid a compliment to my abilities, which only a partial friend&s;hip could have excited, &s;he did nothing more than &s;trict ju&s;tice to the warmth of my affec|tion. I &s;hall really think my&s;elf complimented by your corre&s;pondence. If you will call me father or brother, you will give an unu&s;ual lu&s;tre to my name. This fond heart &s;hall vibrate to your wi&s;h|es and your happine&s;s: and, if you will occa&s;ion|ally vi&s;it my little cot, it &s;hall put on all its lovelie&s;t charms, and &s;mile in all its gaye&s;t attire, to receive &s;o dear and &s;o amiable a &s;tranger. The ro&s;es of my humble garden &s;hall, if po&s;&s;ible, be doubly
<PB N="3" REF="023176_0012_0FBDE2992677D6E0">&s;weet; my Je&s;&s;amines &s;hall emit an unu&s;ual fra|grance; and if nature will but obey, I will order the <HI>general</HI> &s;cenery to be delightful.</P>
<P>We &s;hall reap, I am a&s;&s;ured, <HI>mutual</HI> benefits by this acquaintance. If I am able to communicate to you any little knowledge, you will more than repay it by that ea&s;e, delicacy, refinement, confi|dence and expan&s;ion, which the mind never effec|tually feels, but in the friend&s;hip of a &s;en&s;ible and an intere&s;ting woman. Such a friend&s;hip is the riche&s;t cordial of life. Either of the &s;exes with|out it, are never what they &s;hould be. Like the be&s;t figures, <HI>mutilated,</HI> they appear to di&s;advantage. Unnatural expedients may be tried to &s;upply its place. Bu&s;ine&s;s, ambition, an <HI>over-&s;trained</HI> pru|dence, or peculiar &s;ituations may lead us to deny our&s;elves &s;o &s;weet a plea&s;ure; but, in fact, all hu|man projects and &s;ucce&s;&s;es are <HI>in&s;ipid</HI> without it. They are ro&s;ele&s;s thorns, a winter without a &s;pring. Plea&s;ures have not their reli&s;h, and &s;or|row wants a bo&s;om to recline on. Our man|ners have not their proper &s;oftne&s;s; our morals their purity, and our &s;ouls feel an uncomfortable void.</P>
<P>They, who talk degradingly of women, do not know the value of the trea&s;ure they de&s;pi&s;e. They have not &s;ufficient ta&s;te to reli&s;h their excellencies, or purity enough to court their acquaintance. They have taken the portrait of <HI>abandoned</HI> women, and they think the features applicable to all.</P>
<P>The &s;ofter &s;ex, it is certain, are exceedingly in|jured by their education. If they were, what they <HI>&s;hould</HI> be, they are tho&s;e lights in the picture of human life, that are intended to cheer all its dark|ne&s;s and its &s;hades.</P>

<P>THE education of women is unfortunately di|rected rather to &s;uch accompli&s;hments, as will enable them to make a noi&s;e and &s;parkle in the world, than to tho&s;e qualities, which might en&s;ure their comfort here, and happine&s;s hereafter.

<P>Though religion is indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to <HI>both</HI> &s;exes, and in every po&s;&s;ible character and &s;ta|tion, yet a woman &s;eems, more puculiarly, to need its enlivening &s;upports, whil&s;t her frame mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed to be admirably calculated for the exer|ci&s;e of all the tender and devout affections.</P>
<P>The timidity, ari&s;ing from the natural weakne&s;s and delicacy of your frame; the numerous di&s;ea|&s;es, to which you are liable; that exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;i|bility, which in many of you, vibrate to the &s;light|e&s;t touch of joy or &s;orrow; the tremulous anxiety you have for friends, children, a family, which nothing can relieve, but a &s;en&s;e of their being un|der the protection of God; the &s;edentarine&s;s of your life, naturally followed with low &s;pirits or <HI>ennui,</HI> whil&s;t we are &s;eeking health and plea&s;ure in the field; and the many, lonely hours, which in almo&s;t every &s;ituation, are likely to be your lot, will expo&s;e you to a number of <HI>peculiar</HI> &s;orrows,
<PB N="5" REF="023176_0014_0FBDE29C2431A3E8">which you cannot, like the men, either drown in wine, or divert by di&s;&s;ipation.</P>
<P>From the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">a, that you become marriageable, the &s;phere of your anxieties and afflictions will be enlarged. The generality of men are far from act|ing on &s;uch &s;trict principles of honour and integri|ty, in their connexions with you, as they would rigidly ob&s;erve, in matters of a much more trivial importance. Some delight in &s;porting with your nice&s;t &s;en&s;ibilities, and afterwards expo&s;ing with an <HI>illiberal</HI> triumph, the fondne&s;s of a credulous and un&s;u&s;pecting heart; others, from fa&s;hion merely, and to be called men of gallantry, will &s;ay a thou&s;and civil things, and &s;hew as many prefer|ences, with no other view, than to amu&s;e the mo|ment, or acquire a fanta&s;tic, vi&s;ionary honour. A third &s;ort of men (yes it is po&s;&s;ible that there &s;hould be <HI>male</HI> coquettes!) will do and &s;ay every thing to in&s;pire you with fondne&s;s, and get po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of your heart, whithout proceeding to that ex|planation, which nature has intended to come from <HI>us,</HI> and which the delicacy of your &s;ex, whatever you may <HI>&s;uffer,</HI> will not permit you to demand. Others, without any particular de&s;igns upon you, or improper attentions, (for attachments &s;pring up <HI>in&s;en&s;ibly,</HI> and are as po&s;&s;ible in one &s;ex. as the other,) may be too agreeable for your &s;afety and repo&s;e, and leave you to a &s;ilent, heartfelt concern, which will prey <HI>doubly</HI> in proportion to its <HI>conceal|ment</HI> &mdash;or even when the indi&s;&s;oluble knot of mar|riage is tied, and you have re&s;igned every thing, till it comes to your name and per&s;on, it may be to a man of <HI>mere</HI> integrity, who knows nothing of tho&s;e many, little, tender attentions, which involve &s;o great a &s;hare of a woman's happine&s;s&mdash;it may
<PB N="6" REF="023176_0015_0FBDE29E3662E5B8">be to a per&s;on of great <HI>ambition,</HI> who has neither lei&s;ure nor inclination for &s;oft dome&s;tic &s;cenes&mdash;it may be to a fa&s;hionable <HI>In&s;ipid,</HI> who, for the &s;ake of flirting with &s;ome elegant fair, and giving your <HI>jealou&s;y</HI> the wilde&s;t range, leaves <HI>your</HI> charms and the endearments of his <HI>children</HI> to peri&s;h in neg|lect&mdash;nay &s;takes, perhaps, his very <HI>la&s;t</HI> thou&s;and on the uncertainty of game, when the unhappy throw may con&s;ign both you and your helple&s;s babes to poverty and ruin&mdash;or it may be to a per&s;on of a peevi&s;h, ill-natured, &s;aturnine ca&s;t, <HI>artfully</HI> con|cealed, till he had you in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which no at|tentions can alter, no charms can &s;weeten, and no vivacity can cheer. Under the&s;e, or indeed any <HI>other</HI> di&s;tre&s;&s;es, religion is the only true and unfail|ing re&s;ource, and its hopes and pro&s;pects, the only &s;olid ba&s;is of con&s;olation.

<P>The period, my dear girl, I tru&s;t, is di&s;tant, when &s;uch afflictions &s;hall attack your glowing &s;en&s;ibility.

<P>Never fair to treat, with the greate&s;t reverence, every thing, that relates to the hou&s;e of God, to his mini&s;ters, to his &s;acraments, and to his word.

<P>IF your mind is in a proper frame, every thing in you and about you will inculcate the nece&s;&s;ity, and prompt you to the continual exerci&s;e of, devo|tion.

<P>The power, maje&s;ty, grandeur and wi&s;dom of this Being are di&s;cernable in every part of your frame, in every function of your body, and oper|ation of your mind, nay in the curious and ex|qui&s;ite formation of every animal and in&s;ect.

<P>Is it not then a certain conclu&s;ion, that he creat|ed you, as well as all <HI>inferior</HI> animals for happine&s;s? On <HI>this</HI> you may depend, as much as you can up|on the <HI>certainty</HI> of your exi&s;tence, and that he is
<PB N="14" REF="023176_0023_0FBDE2A9B15A7DB0">always more <HI>willing</HI> to be your protector, than you are ready to reque&s;t it.</P>
<P>Open the <HI>&s;acred book,</HI> and, from beginning to end, it will confirm this opinion, and exalt your ideas of the divine perfections. <Q>I delight in ex|erci&s;ing loving-kindne&s;s, &s;aith the Lord.&mdash;The Lord is good to all, and his tender mercies are over, all his works. If he clothes the gra&s;s of the field, which, to-day, is, and to-morrow is ca&s;t into the oven, how much more &s;hall he clothe you, O ye of little faith?</Q> <HI>That</HI> religi|on is built on <HI>wrong</HI> notions, or a <HI>melancholy</HI> tem|per, that fills us with <HI>imaginary</HI> terrors. All na|ture breathes a language of hope and mercy. And <HI>nature</HI> is the me&s;&s;enger of God.</P>
<P>It is true there is <HI>evil</HI> in the world, as well as good; there are marks of <HI>judgment,</HI> as well as mer|cy. There are hurricanes, as well as fanning breezes; <HI>noxious</HI> are intermixed with u&s;eful ani|mals; <HI>poi&s;onous</HI> and &s;alutary herbs grow <HI>be&s;ide</HI> each other, and ro&s;es have their thorns. There are wars and rumours of wars; there are earthquakes, that de&s;olate <HI>whole</HI> countries; a thou&s;and forms of di&s;ea&s;e; a thou&s;and modifications of &s;orrow, anxiety, death. If he, who &s;its at the helm, be &s;o gracious, whence all this di&s;order? If his infi|nite power be combined with equal wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, why did he not prevent it?</P>
<P>If men were not to be free agents, the <HI>total</HI> pre|vention of &s;in and evil &s;eems an <HI>impo&s;&s;ibility.</HI> Moral <HI>liberty</HI> could not con&s;i&s;t with a <HI>mechanical,</HI> forced obedience; and if we had <HI>not</HI> been free, the idea of puni&s;hments or rewards, of an heaven or an hell, would be the greate&s;t of all po&s;&s;ible ab&s;urdities. So that the que&s;tion <HI>ultimately</HI> amounts to this,
<PB N="15" REF="023176_0024_0FBDE2AB2DFBFCE8">whether it was proper for the Almighty to create &s;uch a world at all? Had we not better re&s;erve the propriety of this conduct to be di&s;puted with him, at his great tribunal? <HI>There,</HI> I doubt not, we &s;hall be amply convinced, that the creation was a work of infinite <HI>mercy,</HI> as well as power, and that a greater degree of <HI>happine&s;s,</HI> than mi&s;ery has ari&s;en from it. There too, when we are able to di&s;cern with <HI>glorified</HI> eyes, the whole chain of cau&s;es and effects, from the beginning, to the end, of time; the dependence of one link of being on another, and of worlds, on worlds; this evil we now complain of, may become a means of exalting our ideas of the attributes of the Almighty; and we &s;hall blu&s;h at our&s;elves for even having que&s;|tioned his goodne&s;s for a moment, or encouraged a rea&s;oning pride, &s;o ill becoming creatures, who&s;e days are few, who&s;e &s;trength is weakne&s;s, who&s;e wi&s;dom folly; and who, in the pre&s;ent <HI>immure|ment</HI> of their under&s;tanding, &s;carcely know the na|ture of a blade of gra&s;s, or of the very pebbles, on which they tread.</P>
<P>This que&s;tion concerning the <HI>origin</HI> of evil has puzzled the whole tribe of rea&s;oners and philo&s;o|phers, from the creation, to the pre&s;ent moment. The &s;cripture alone has &s;olved the enigma to our &s;atisfaction. This deranged &s;tate of things is the providential puni&s;hment of guilt, but at the &s;ame time, contrived in mercy, as a &s;alutary regimen, and as a mode of purifying fallen creatures for the innocence and happine&s;s of a better world. It is a <HI>chao;,</HI> fitted to our <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> con&s;titution, and will refine, as <HI>we</HI> do, into its primitive beauty and &s;plendour. <Q>There &s;hall then be new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteou&s;|ne&s;s.
<PB N="16" REF="023176_0025_0FBDE2ACAC79C5D0">The wolf &s;hall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard lie down with the kid, when the earth is full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the &s;eas.</Q> Re&s;ignation, in the mean time, has a balm for &s;uffering, and the faith of a chri&s;tian <Q>looketh to a better country, with foundations, who&s;e builder and maker is God.</Q></P>
<P>But &s;peculations apart, if you draw nigh to the Almighty, he will draw nigh to you; if you &s;eek his favor and friend&s;hip, all things &s;hall work to|gether for your good. Tribulation, angui&s;h, na|kedne&s;s, or famine, or peril, or the &s;word will all be &s;o many in&s;truments, in his hands, of procuring your eternal happine&s;s and glory.</P>
<P>Remember the gift of his only Son to be a &s;acrifice for your &s;ins, and it is more than a thou&s;and le&s;&s;ons of a mercy beyond a parallel, and that far exceeds all human comprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>On &s;o delightful a &s;ubject, it is difficult to &s;to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> one's pen, or re&s;train the &s;allies of imagination.

<HEAD>LETTER VI.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR GIRL,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>DEVOTION, con&s;idered &s;imply in it&s;elf, is an intercour&s;e betwixt us and God; betwixt the &s;u|preme,
<PB N="17" REF="023176_0026_0FBDE2AE5D630A70">&s;elf-exi&s;tent, inconceivable &s;pirit, which formed and pre&s;erves the univer&s;e, and that parti|cular &s;pirit, with which, for awful rea&s;ons, he has animated a portion of <HI>matter</HI> upon earth, that we call man. It is a &s;ilent act, in which the &s;oul dive&s;ts it&s;elf of <HI>outward</HI> things, flies into heaven, and pours forth all its wants, wi&s;hes, hopes, fears, guilt or plea&s;ures, into the bo&s;om of an <HI>almighty</HI> friend.</P>
<P>Though this devotion, in its fir&s;t &s;tages, may be a weari&s;ome or <HI>in&s;ipid</HI> exerci&s;e, yet this ari&s;es mere|ly from the depravity of nature, and of our pa&s;|&s;ions. A little <HI>habit</HI> will overcome this reluctance. When you have fairly entered on your journey, <Q>the ways of this wi&s;dom will be ways of plea|&s;antne&s;s, and all its paths, peace.</Q></P>
<P>True devotion, doubtle&s;s, requires a con&s;idera|ble degree of <HI>ab&s;traction</HI> from the world. Hence <HI>modern</HI> chri&s;tians treat it, as a <HI>vi&s;ion.</HI> Hence ma|ny <HI>modern</HI> writers have little of its unction. But it glows in the &s;criptures. It warms us in the fa|thers. It burned in an Au&s;tin, and in many other of tho&s;e per&s;ecuted martyrs, who now are with God.</P>
<P>That we <HI>hear</HI> little of it, is not wonderful. It makes no noi&s;e in the circles of the learned or of the elegant. Under an heap of worldly cares, we <HI>&s;mother</HI> the lovely infant, and will not let it breathe. Vanity, ambition, plea&s;ure, avarice, quench the cele&s;tial fire. And the&s;e alas! are too much the god of <HI>mortals!</HI> Ever &s;ince the world began, writers have been amu&s;ing us only with <HI>&s;hadows</HI> of this piety, in&s;tead of giving us its <HI>&s;oul</HI> and <HI>&s;ub&s;tance.</HI> Super&s;tition has placed it in opini|ons, ceremonies, au&s;terities, pilgrimages, <HI>per&s;ecu|tion,</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="023176_0027_0FBDE2AFB01DA468">an augu&s;t temple, or &s;plendid imagery, which had little connexion with &s;entiment or &s;pirit. Enthu&s;ia&s;m has &s;welled with <HI>unnatural</HI> conceptions, and obtruded a <HI>&s;purious</HI> offspring on the world, in&s;tead of this engaging child of rea&s;on and truth; whil&s;t the lukewarm have re&s;ted in a few out|ward duties, which have had no vigour, and, as they &s;prung not from the heart, never entered the temple of the mo&s;t High.</P>
<P>Real piety is of a very different, and of a much more <HI>animated,</HI> nature. It looks up to God, &s;ees, hears, feels him, in every event, in every vici&s;&s;i|tude, in all places, in all &s;ea&s;ons, and upon all oc|ca&s;ions. It is theory, vivified by experience. It is faith, <HI>&s;ub&s;tantiated</HI> by <HI>mental</HI> enjoyment. It is heaven, tran&s;planted into the human bo&s;om. It is the radiance of the Divinity, warming and incir|cling man. It is <HI>&s;piritual</HI> &s;en&s;e, gratified by <HI>&s;pi|ritual</HI> &s;en&s;ations. Without <HI>this,</HI> all <HI>ceremonies</HI> are inefficacious. Books, prayers, &s;acraments and meditations are but a body, without a &s;oul, or a &s;tatue, without animation.</P>
<P>That man is <HI>capable</HI> of &s;uch an intercour&s;e with his maker, there are many <HI>living</HI> witne&s;&s;es to prove. Without having recour&s;e to the vi&s;ions of fanatics, or the dreams of enthu&s;ia&s;ts, it may be proved to &s;pring from natural and <HI>philo&s;ophical</HI> cau&s;es. God is a &s;pirit; &s;o is the mind. <HI>Bodies</HI> can have intercour&s;e; &s;o can <HI>&s;ouls.</HI> When minds are in an <HI>a&s;&s;imilating</HI> &s;tate of purity, they have union with their Maker. This was the bli&s;s of <HI>paradi&s;e;</HI> &s;in interrupted, and holine&s;s mu&s;t re&s;tore it. To a &s;oul, thus di&s;po&s;ed, the creator commu|nicates him&s;elf, in a manner, which is as in&s;en&s;ible to the natural eye, as the falling of dews, but not
<PB N="19" REF="023176_0028_0FBDE2B12DFA1C70">le&s;s refre&s;hing to its &s;ecret powers, than <HI>that</HI> is to vegetation.</P>
<P>The primitive &s;aints are de&s;cribing this, when they &s;peak of their tran&s;ports. David felt it, when he longed for God, as the heart panteth after the water brooks. St. Paul knew it, when he gloried in his tribulations. It was <HI>embodied</HI> in him, when he was carried up into the third heavens, and heard things, impo&s;&s;ible to be uttered. St. Stephen was filled with it, when he &s;aw the heavens open, and prayed for his murderers. By it, martyrs were &s;upported, when they were &s;toned, and &s;awn a&s;un|der. And till we feel it in <HI>our&s;elves,</HI> we &s;hall ne|ver fully know, how gracious the Lord is.</P>
<P>If you can acquire this &s;piritual <HI>ab&s;traction,</HI> you will, at once, have made your fortune for eterni|ty. It will be of little moment, what is your lot on earth, or what the di&s;tingui&s;hing vici&s;&s;itudes of your life. Pro&s;perity or adver&s;ity, health or &s;ick|ne&s;s, honor or di&s;grace, a cottage or a crown, will all be &s;o many in&s;truments of glory. The whole creation will become a <HI>temple.</HI> Every event and every object will lead your mind to God, and in his greatne&s;s and perfections, you will in&s;en&s;i|bly lo&s;e the littlene&s;s, the glare and tin&s;el of all human things.</P>
<P>If I wi&s;hed only to &s;et off your <HI>per&s;on</HI> to the greate&s;t advantage, I would recommend this true <HI>&s;ublime</HI> of religion. It gives a plea&s;ing &s;erenity to the countenance, and a cheerfulne&s;s to the &s;pirits beyond the reach of art, or the power of affecta|tion. It communicates a real tran&s;port to the mind, which di&s;&s;ipation mimics only for a mo|ment; a &s;weetne&s;s to the di&s;po&s;ition, and a <HI>lu&s;tre</HI> to the manners, which all the airs of modern po|litene&s;s
<PB N="20" REF="023176_0029_0FBDE2B2B0B56410">&s;tudy but in vain. Ea&s;y in your&s;elf, it will make you in perfect good humour with the world, and when you are diffu&s;ing happine&s;s around you, <Q>you will only be dealing out the broken fragments, that remain after you have eaten.</Q></P>

<P>THIS devotion, however, though <HI>e&s;&s;entially</HI> a &s;ilent intercour&s;e betwixt the &s;oul and God, yet, to creatures, con&s;i&s;ting of <HI>matter,</HI> as well as &s;pirit, mu&s;t be nouri&s;hed by <HI>external</HI> forma.

<P>ANOTHER excellent method of inkindling piety, is <HI>reading the &s;criptures.</HI> A chri&s;tian, in|deed, &s;hould have this &s;acred book, ever folded in his brea&s;t. There is a richne&s;s and a comfort in it, that nothing el&s;e can equal. Every word is big with in&s;truction; every &s;entence is divine. It is a mine, perpetually opening; the deeper we
<PB N="22" REF="023176_0031_0FBDE2B5B049C930">dig, the richer is the ore. It is a fea&s;t, adapted to <HI>every</HI> ta&s;te; the mo&s;t exalted under&s;tanding mu&s;t admire, and the <HI>lowe&s;t</HI> cannot fail to comprehend, its in&s;tructions.</P>
<P>If people only read for the &s;ake of <HI>entertainment,</HI> where can they find a book equal to the Bible? What other production, either ancient or modern, has &s;uch &s;triking pa&s;&s;ages of the pathetic and &s;ub|lime, the vehement and impa&s;&s;ioned? Where are there &s;uch lofty images, &s;uch grand conceptions, or &s;uch picture&s;que and animated de&s;criptions, as in the p&s;alms? There is &s;carcely a per&s;on in the world, to who&s;e ca&s;e &s;ome of them are not adapted, nor a &s;orrow which they cannot &s;ooth. In one part, plaintive, affecting, penitential; in another full of triumph and exultation, ennobling elevat|ing; here de&s;cribing the immen&s;ity, maje&s;ty, om|nipotence and omnipre&s;ence of God; there the littlene&s;s of the world, and the vanity of man; whoever can read them without emotion, mu&s;t be pronounced void both of piety and ta&s;te.</P>
<P>The prophets are the true <HI>&s;ublime</HI> of holy reading. The bold images, metaphors, allu&s;ions and de&s;criptions, with which they abound, have been the admiration of the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed &s;cholars, orators and critics in the world. The proverbs of Solomon and the book of Eccle&s;i|a&s;ticus are an excellent &s;y&s;tem for the government of private life, as well as a fund of &s;piritual in|&s;truction! They have all the <HI>marrow</HI> of our <HI>mo|dern</HI> &s;y&s;tems of good breeding, without any of their <HI>poi&s;on.</HI> The &s;acred &s;tories of the &s;cripture are related with amazing &s;implicity and pathos; the parables are beautifully pointed and in&s;truc|tive; and the epi&s;tles of St. Paul are a model
<PB N="23" REF="023176_0032_0FBDE2B73582B718">of the &s;ublime&s;t and mo&s;t energetic eloquence, that can be found in any age, or in any language.</P>
<P>When the immortal Locke and Newton had dived into every <HI>other</HI> kind of knowledge, they &s;at down to contemplate the vanity and poverty of all, in the richne&s;s of the &s;criptures. The famous Bacon, an oracle of learning, in his day, and the wonder of all &s;ucceeding ages, confe&s;&s;ed them to be the &s;ource of all <HI>real wi&s;dom.</HI> The il|lu&s;trious Selden, on his death-bed, a&s;&s;ured arch|bi&s;hop U&s;her, that the <HI>whole</HI> of his immen&s;e library could not give him half the comfort, which he derived from one <HI>&s;ingle</HI> &s;entence of the in&s;pired writings; and Addi&s;on, who&s;e name mu&s;t be ever dear to every friend of religion and virtue, &s;pent no little time in collecting together, and arranging into one common point of view, the united evidences of the chri&s;tian religion.</P>
<P>The primitive chri&s;tians u&s;ed to read this book, on their knees. Their preface was, <Q>Open thou mine eyes, that I may &s;ee the wondrous things of thy law.</Q> Imitate them on earth, and in <HI>time</HI> you &s;hall join that illu&s;trious choir of &s;aints, that are continually wor&s;hipping before the throne in heaven.</P>

<P>THE old Scriptures may appear, in them&s;elves, dry and in&s;ipid; but when you con&s;ider them, as <HI>typical</HI> of the new, and affording a &s;trong, colla|teral
<PB N="24" REF="023176_0033_0FBDE2B8AE0BA0D0">te&s;timony to the truth of revelation; as de|&s;cribing the circum&s;tances, manners, and anec|dotes of a peculiar, cho&s;en people, who&s;e hi&s;tory, rebellion, captivity and di&s;per&s;ion are interwoven with the whole &s;y&s;tem of chri&s;tianity, you will read them with a greater reli&s;h, and more godly edification.</P>
<P>Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the foundation of the apo&s;tles and prophets; all the incidents you read, point to him, as their origin, and as their end; <Q>the great corner &s;tone in Zion; the lamb &s;lain from the foundation of the world.</Q></P>
<P>The bondage of the children of I&s;rael in Egypt, is an image of <HI>our</HI> captivity to &s;in and their deli|verance, of our redemption through the blood of Chri&s;t; their journeying through the wilderne&s;s, is a &s;trong picture of our weari&s;ome pa&s;&s;age through this vale of tears. Mo&s;es is the Saviour, making waters of comfort gu&s;h from the &s;tony rock; the manna is the food of his word, and the waters are the graces of his holy &s;pirit; the beau|tiful and affecting hi&s;tory of Jo&s;eph is an emblem of that better per&s;onage, who was envied, hated, per&s;ecuted and murdered by his brethren, for the general &s;alvation: Abraham is a &s;triking image of the Almighty, offering up his only &s;on, and all the <HI>ceremonies</HI> of the law point to that true <HI>blood</HI> of &s;prinkling, which alone can take away the &s;ins of the world. Thus is <HI>every</HI> page holy; thus do you tread, every moment, on con&s;ecrated ground, and thus every word, when <HI>properly</HI> under&s;tood, is &s;pirit and is life.</P>
<P>But of <HI>all</HI> the &s;criptures, the go&s;pels are cer|tainly the mo&s;t edifying and in&s;tructive. They are plain, forcible, &s;piritual; they come from the
<PB N="25" REF="023176_0034_0FBDE2BA2F5C92A0">very mouth of holine&s;s and wi&s;dom, and do not admit of any wrong con&s;tructions or doubtful in|terpretations. If there was only the fifth chapter of St. Matthew's go&s;pel extant, we &s;hould have an incomparable abridgement of chri&s;tianity, &s;uffici|ent to direct our faith, to animate our practice, and fla&s;h confu&s;ion on that ho&s;t of writers, who have built &s;o many &s;trong and dangerous opinions on the pretended ba&s;is of revelation.</P>
<P>Commentators may &s;erve to explain an ea&s;tern cu&s;tom, ceremony, allu&s;ion or mode of expre&s;&s;ion, but I cannot in general, recommend them, at lea&s;t to young people. They embarra&s;s more frequent|ly, than they direct; they have often perplexed, what, in it&s;elf, was clear, and darkened, where they affected to illuminate. The &s;ayings of our Lord are &s;o very obvious, as to need little or no explanation. They are a precious wine, which the profane wi&s;dom of &s;cholars and philo&s;ophers has mixed with water. If men had only &s;tudied them with earne&s;tne&s;s, in&s;tead of their own intere&s;ts, prejudices and pa&s;&s;ions, we &s;hould never have been di&s;tracted with &s;o many &s;y&s;tems of error and &s;u|per&s;tition.</P>
<P>Do not read much, at a time. Meditation is the &s;tomach, which dige&s;ts this food; you &s;hould <HI>reflect</HI> many hours, for reading <HI>one.</HI> And there is &s;uch a conden&s;ed richne&s;s in the &s;criptures, that one &s;ingle ver&s;e will often &s;ugge&s;t an ample fund for &s;erious contemplation.</P>
<P>Every moment, that you peru&s;e this book, con&s;ider your&s;elf as in the immediate pre&s;ence of your Maker. Fancy that you heard him, deli|vering the commandments, in all the thunder and lightning of the mount. Remember that, though
<PB N="26" REF="023176_0035_0FBDE2BBAF9C2028">heaven and earth fail, one jot or one tittle &s;hall, in no wi&s;e, pa&s;s from the law, till all be fulfilled. Con&s;ider what a number of holy men have &s;ealed the truth of this te&s;timony with their blood. Ex|amine your&s;elf by the promi&s;es and threatenings, as you go along, and do not forget to ble&s;s God, upon your knees, that he has given you &s;uch a lamp for your feet, and &s;uch a light to your paths.</P>
<P>Without this &s;acred volume, the world would have been, at this very moment, con&s;iderably un|enlightened; wor&s;hipping &s;tocks or &s;tones, per|haps offering human blood, and tormenting them|&s;elves with burden&s;ome ceremonies, that had no manner of connection with the heart; immer&s;ed in &s;orrows, which they could not have ea&s;ed, and perplexed with a thou&s;and, gloomy enigmas, which they never could have &s;olved. The light, which &s;uperficial &s;ceptics vaunt, as that of <HI>nature</HI> or phi|lo&s;ophy, or, in a great degree, derived from the &s;criptures. The arguments, which they level again&s;t chri&s;tianity, have been &s;ugge&s;ted by the light of chri&s;tianity it&s;elf.</P>

<P>I &s;carcely know a woman, that de&s;erves &s;o much from the community at large, as Mrs. Trimmer.

<P>I cannot, in this re&s;pect, &s;o much recommend <HI>modern</HI> &s;ermons, as &s;ome little practical treati&s;es of piety. Engli&s;h di&s;cour&s;es in general, by a ftrange, &s;chola&s;tic mi&s;management, are not &s;uffi|ciently addre&s;&s;ed to the <HI>heart.</HI> Either they are learned di&s;qui&s;itions, on &s;ome <HI>&s;peculative,</HI> contro|verted &s;ubject, more calculated to di&s;play abili|ties, than to edify; or they are &s;pruce, moral e&s;|&s;ays with little more of <HI>chri&s;tianity</HI> in them, than might be gleaned from the works of Plato or Epic|tetus. They want that &s;implicity, fire, energy, animation, that boldne&s;s of images, appeal to the con&s;cience, and that picture&s;que di&s;play of heaven and hell, which give &s;uch an unction to the writ|ings of St. Paul, and of the fathers. They do not thunder and lighten at the &s;inner: they do not carry us by a whirlwind, into heaven, and &s;hew us thrones and &s;ceptres; they convince, but they do not animate; they <HI>glitter,</HI> but they do not <HI>warm.</HI></P>
<P>Ancient divines have more fire and matter. They &s;tudied the &s;criptures, more than <HI>human</HI> &s;y&s;tems. "They were filled with the &s;pirit;" they were men of watchfulne&s;s and prayers. A pro|fane &s;pirit of critici&s;m or of philo&s;ophy, fal&s;ely &s;o called, makes <HI>us</HI> cold and languid. In pervading many learned or &s;plendid pages, the heart is often left devoid of one, pious emotion.</P>
<P>Many &s;ermons, no doubt, are to be excepted from this cen&s;ure. Tho&s;e of Archbi&s;hop Secker contain a fund of &s;olid matter, piety and in&s;truc|tion; but the <HI>&s;tyle</HI> is rather &s;ingular and uncouth. The marble is rich, but it is unpoli&s;hed, There

<P>Few prelates, however, have de&s;erved &s;o well from the church, or po&s;terity. The metropolitan, though placed in the bo&s;om of a court, had neither pride, indolence, nor adulation. His vigilance was extraordinary; his labours unremitting, and his crofier but an imperfect emblem of the real pa&s;|toral zeal, "which eat up his &s;oul."

<P>THERE is more popular eloquence, argument and pathos in Archbi&s;hop Tillor&s;on, than in al|mo&s;t any ancient writer of &s;ermons, that I recol|lect.

<P>THE late, unfortunate Dr. Dodd owed, I &s;hould conceive, his great popularity to the ad|vantage of his voice, per&s;on, manner, ge&s;ture and addre&s;s. For indeed his compo&s;itions have not intrin&s;ic merit enough to have challenged any ex|traordinary applau&s;e.</P>
<P>Weak, flim&s;y, &s;uperficial in his arguments, and rather plau&s;ible, than energetic in his language, it mu&s;t have been only the <HI>popularity</HI> of his &s;ub|jects, the new vein of <HI>pathetic,</HI> which he attempt|ed, and his fortunate congenial &s;ituation at the Magdalen, and in a metropolis, which, under the management of &s;uch advantages, procured him his exten&s;ive, <HI>temporary</HI> reputation.</P>
<P>But alas! his popularity was very dearly pur|cha&s;ed! It was built on the ruins of his innocence and virtue. Happy, if he had lived and died in ob&s;curity, or been an humble curate in &s;ome &s;e|que&s;tered village, where je&s;&s;amines had cla&s;ped round his unenvied man&s;ion, with unenlightened ru&s;tics only for his a&s;&s;ociates! Admiration would not then have dazzled his eyes. His vanity could not have &s;ought tho&s;e <HI>unequal</HI> connexions, which he afterwards found him&s;elf unable to &s;upport, nor expen&s;ive plea&s;ures led him to an action, which wounded religion in its very vitals, and brought &s;o much di&s;grace on his &s;acred profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>He might, then, like many other excellent men, have "fallen a&s;leep," amid&s;t the tender offices of bewailing friends; and grateful villagers,
<PB N="36" REF="023176_0045_0FBDE2CAADDE66B0">would have wetted his monument with tears of heart-felt gratitude and e&s;teem.

What is the conclu&s;ion? Hear it from compa&s;&s;ion. Bathed in tears. &s;he lifts up her voice, and cries aloud, <Q>Let him who thinketh he &s;tandeth, take heed le&s;t he fall.</Q></P>
<P>Faringdon's Sermons have very &s;ingular merit. It is but &s;eldom that &s;o much vivacity finds its way into this &s;pecies of writing.

It is many years &s;ince I read them; but the impre&s;&s;ion they made upon my mind, will never be era&s;ed.</P>
<P>If I dur&s;t invidiou&s;ly, amid&s;t their many excel|lencies, mention a defect, it is, that they are not &s;ufficiently full of <HI>&s;criptural</HI> allu&s;ions.

<P>YOUNG people are in raptures with (what they <HI>chu&s;e</HI> to call) Sterne's Sermons. But true critici&s;m will not give them &s;o dignified a name.

<P>Sermons, that aim only to <HI>amu&s;e</HI> or <HI>entertain,</HI> are beneath the pulpit.

<P>The fingular merit of this little book is obvious from its tran&s;lation into almo&s;t all languages. Ganganelli a&s;cribes it, with pride, to an <HI>Italian</HI> author. But, whatever country gave it birth, it is filled with a &s;acred unction, and "the wi&s;dom which cometh from above." Read a chapter of it every day, and you will never want a fund of chri&s;tian meditations.</P>

His poems, therefore, have much the &s;train of elegy, and his piety is breathed in &s;ighs.

<P>I do not remember to have received more plea|&s;ure and improvement from any book, that I have read for &s;ome time pa&s;t, than from the two fir&s;t vo|lumes of Ganganelli's Letters. Be&s;ides being &s;ur|prized to &s;ee &s;uch a generous mode of thinking in the &s;overeign pontiff, &s;o much vivacity in a <HI>monk,</HI> tempered with &s;o great a &s;hare of unaffected piety, I was quite charmed with the &s;implicity of his &s;tyle, the beauty of his metaphors, and that &s;pirit of philanthropy, which pervades the whole, and does, all along, more honour to his heart, than his ea&s;y periods, to his under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething in the climate of Italy, which wonderfully heats and &s;ublimes the imagin|ation.

<P>When your judgment is more matured, you &s;hould examine authors of all different per&s;ua&s;ions, as the Grecian arti&s;t did women, when he wi&s;hed to paint his Venus of Medici.

<P>All &s;y&s;tems, like all human figures, have their defects; but they have, likewi&s;e, their excellen|cies. Collect the&s;e, di&s;tinct charms, and work them up in the crucible of your heart, till they produce "the very beauty of holine&s;s" in your life and conver&s;ation.</P>

<P>This re&s;timony in favour of revelation, is di|vided, for the &s;ake of order, into two kinds, <HI>internal</HI> and <HI>external.</HI> The internal is that, which ari&s;es from the nature and excellency of the pre|cepts <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> and from the writers having had no <HI>private</HI> or &s;ini&s;ter views to an&s;wer, but con&s;ult|ing only the <HI>general</HI> good and edification of man|kind.</P>
<P>This <HI>fir&s;t</HI> mark of authenticity is fixed on every page of the &s;criptures. The laws of Chri&s;t are of &s;uch a nature, as no man would have framed, who wi&s;hed to avail him&s;elf of the pa&s;&s;ions, prejudices and intere&s;ts of mankind; for they pre&s;cribe, on the other hand, an univer&s;al humility, mortifica|tion and &s;elf-denial; exhibit, in the &s;tronge&s;t col|ours, the emptine&s;s of riches, and the vanity of ambition, and have no other view, but to elevate the affections, regenerate the heart, and put all men on looking beyond the tran&s;ient concerns of this life, to the happine&s;s of another. What el&s;e could happen to the original promulgers of the&s;e laws, but that, which <HI>actually</HI> did, violence and per&s;ecution?</P>
<P>Our ble&s;&s;ed Lord po&s;itively declared, that his kingdom was not of this world. He &s;ought none of its di&s;tinctions, and he feceived none, unle&s;s, by a &s;trange perver&s;ion of ideas, we place them in the poverty of a manger, or the tortures of his cro&s;s. His <HI>apo&s;tles</HI> were inflamed with the very &s;ame, <HI>di&s;intere&s;ted</HI> zeal. They willingly re&s;igned
<PB N="48" REF="023176_0057_0FBDE2DCAE13BEF0">lucrative employments at the call of their ma&s;ter; they cheerfully abandoned weeping friends; un|dertook the mo&s;t hazardous voyages and travels; had no re&s;t day or night, were carried before kings and governors of the earth, "and even hat|ed by all men for his name's &s;ake."</P>
<P>Read the account of their labours, per&s;ecution, bani&s;hment, death; peru&s;e the hi&s;tory of all the martyrs, written with their blood, and tell me, whether their zeal mu&s;t not have come from <HI>heaven,</HI> or what could ever have in&s;pired it, but a &s;incere conviction of duty, "a faith, which looked to a city with foundations, who&s;e builder and maker was God."</P>

<P>THINK, my dear girl, for your&s;elf. Are there any marks of &s;ecular wi&s;dom or policy or impo&s;ture, in the conduct of the primitive apo&s;tles and chri&s;tians? Examine the hi&s;tory of the whole world, as it relates to religion, and where <HI>el&s;e</HI> will you di&s;cover any portion of the &s;ame, di&s;intere&s;ted &s;pirit, which actuated the&s;e original publi&s;hers of the go&s;pel?</P>
<P>The Roman Emperor in&s;tituted a &s;acred code to work upon the con&s;ciences, and to keep the minds of a &s;avage and a barbarous people in &s;ub|jection to <HI>government.</HI> Zoroa&s;ter, Lycurgus, Solon, all celebrated in their day, and certainly
<PB N="49" REF="023176_0058_0FBDE2DE2F285F58">men of extraordinary talents, had more a view to <HI>policy,</HI> than any <HI>moral</HI> intere&s;ts, in their re&s;pective &s;y&s;tems of legi&s;lation. Mahomet availed him&s;elf of the narrow, <HI>&s;en&s;ual</HI> views, and pa&s;&s;ions of his fol|lowers, and of the particular complexion and di&s;|&s;en&s;ions of his times, merely to be the &s;ole, exclu|&s;ive monarch of an exten&s;ive empire, and procure a little fading honor and di&s;tinction.</P>
<P><Q>The kingdom of all <HI>the&s;e</HI> men was certainly of <HI>this</HI> world,</Q> and their laws, in many in|&s;tances, were repugnant to right rea&s;on, and the be&s;t and deare&s;t intere&s;ts of their fellow creatures. Of Chri&s;t, his very <HI>enemies</HI> &s;aid, "never man &s;pake, like this man;" his injunctions had but <HI>one</HI> a&s;pect&mdash;to <HI>univer&s;ul</HI> happine&s;s, and one, &s;imple method to it&mdash;univer&s;al <HI>reformation.</HI> The angels that announced him, at his fir&s;t appearance, pro|claimed "peace on earth, and good-will towards men."</P>
<P>Nor is the wonderful <HI>progre&s;s</HI> of this religion, in &s;o <HI>&s;hort</HI> a &s;pace of time, over all A&s;ia, and a great part of Europe, indeed over almo&s;t the <HI>whole</HI> of the, <HI>then,</HI> known world, the lea&s;t convincing proof of its divine original. Con&s;ider the <HI>mi&s;&s;ion|aries</HI>&mdash;illiterate fi&s;hermen and mechanics, and you mu&s;t conclude, either that they were endowed with <HI>&s;upernatural</HI> gifts and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or that their wonderful <HI>&s;ucce&s;s</HI> was even a greater <HI>miracle,</HI> than the endowment, you di&s;pute.</P>
<P>On this &s;ubject, permit me to recommend to your &s;erious peru&s;al, Soame Jenyn's Internal Evi|dence of the Chri&s;tian Religion. He is, on the whole, a fanciful writer; but this is an excellent, little book, that has done much good, and comes with greater force, to every bo&s;om, as he was
<PB N="50" REF="023176_0059_0FBDE2DFEC571300">once, according to his own candid confe&s;&s;ion, in the number of tho&s;e, who di&s;puted the &s;acred truths of revelation. You will receive great plea|&s;ure and improvement, likewi&s;e, from Addi&s;on's Evidences of Chri&s;tianity, arranged and collected into one volume, and from a late, &s;imilar produc|tion of the celebrated Dr. Beattie.</P>
<P>Every <HI>word</HI> of the &s;criptures, indeed, mu&s;t con|vince any candid or thoughtful per&s;on, that they come from God. The pa&s;&s;ions, pride vices and intere&s;ts of mankind have induced not a few to &s;et up for &s;ceptics. "Much learning has made them mad," or a little has rendered them <HI>frivolous</HI> and conceited. They have &s;ought only to di&s;tin|gui&s;h them&s;elves by uncommon opinions; they have been <HI>dupes</HI> to their own <HI>fancied</HI> penetration; they have attempted to gra&s;p the immen&s;ity of the Deity, in arms of <HI>fle&s;h,</HI> or have &s;hrunk into &s;cep|tici&s;m, as a refuge from their vices.</P>
<P>Hear what the &s;cripture &s;aith, <Q>Every one, that doeth evil, hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, le&s;t his deeds &s;hould be reproved. Except ye become as little children, (humble, docile, tractable,) ye cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven. How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and &s;eck not the honour, which cometh of God only!</Q></P>

<P>THE <HI>external</HI> te&s;timony, in favour of the chri&s;|tian religion, ari&s;es from prophecy, miracles, and the corre&s;ponding evidence of hi&s;tory. And the&s;e
<PB N="51" REF="023176_0060_0FBDE2E13068DE38">&s;eem to include all the <HI>probable</HI> methods, which heaven could employ for the conver&s;ion of man|kind.</P>
<P>The whole &s;acred book of the Old Te&s;tament is, from beginning to end, a clear prediction of the Me&s;&s;iah. One of the prophets has foretold the preci&s;e year, in which this "righteous branch" &s;hould make his appearance. And this event, you know, <HI>has</HI> taken place to the comfort of the chri&s;|tian world.</P>
<P>Others have predicted the de&s;truction of Jeru|&s;alem, Babylon, Tyre, the di&s;per&s;ion and calami|ties of the Jews, &amp;c. long before they happened;&mdash; and all pro&s;ane hi&s;tory, which has been written &s;ince their time, will inform you, that the&s;e aw|&s;ul judgments were wonderfully accompli&s;hed, in their proper &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>The Revelation contains <HI>darker</HI> hints of &s;ome events, that are vi&s;ibly, though <HI>gradually</HI> fulfilling, at this moment. But as I can only <HI>glance</HI> at the &s;ubject, you will &s;ee it treated in &s;uch a manner, as to confirm your faith and exait your devotion, in the late Bi&s;hop of Bri&s;tol (Dr. Newton's) di&s;|cour&s;es on the Prophecies.</P>
<P>The miracles of our Saviour and of his imme|diate apo&s;tles meet you in every page of the in|&s;pired book; and in <HI>profane</HI> hi&s;tory, you will learn from tho&s;e, who were avowed <HI>enemies</HI> to the cau&s;e, that, at a particular period of time, there <HI>did</HI> exi&s;t &s;uch a &s;acred per&s;onage, as Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who wrought miracles, healed the &s;ick, and rai&s;ed the dead; &s;uch a &s;ect, as that of Chri&s;tians, who met to receive the &s;acrament, who bound them&s;elves by <HI>this</HI> oath, to commit no iniquity, practi&s;ed a wonderful innocence and au&s;terity of manners, and,
<PB N="52" REF="023176_0061_0FBDE2E2B0014A98">beyond all example, loved one another. You will &s;ee likewi&s;e, in the &s;ame pages, a full de&s;cription of their manners, morals, ceremonies and religi|ous in&s;titutions.</P>
<P>The lap&s;e of time, moreover, to us, who live in the&s;e <HI>later</HI> times, has given an <HI>additional</HI> force to the evidences, in favour of revelation. The ingenious author of the Spectator, in his day, con|&s;idered the particular ca&s;e of the Jews, their cala|mities, di&s;per&s;ion, vagabond, un&s;ettled &s;tate, &amp;c. as a &s;tanding and inconte&s;table <HI>miracle,</HI> in &s;upport of the &s;acred writings. They <HI>&s;till</HI> continue (what is there &s;o circum&s;tantially foretold,) unable to in|corporate with any people, and loaded with the hatred and abhorrence of all. The te&s;timony, therefore, from <HI>their</HI> hi&s;tory is proportionably more illu&s;trated and confirmed.</P>
<P>The de&s;truction of the Romi&s;h church, like|wi&s;e, is palpably predicted in the &s;criptures. And, if we may judge from &s;trong appearances, is daily approaching. The great and general diffu&s;ion of knowledge; the con&s;equent progre&s;s of religious toleration, and that di&s;per&s;ion of the mi&s;ts of pre|judice from all eyes, produced by the genial rays of a meridian &s;un, mu&s;t, in time, effect the down|fall of all tyranny and &s;uper&s;tition: whil&s;t the em|peror, employed in de&s;troying mona&s;teries, and encouraging population, appears an in&s;trument in the hand of Providence, for accelerating the ap|proach of this au&s;picious moment. The late di&s;|memberment, moreover, of territory from the Holy See; the contentions, in which the &s;overeign pontiff has been involved by tho&s;e monarchs, who <HI>once</HI> trembled at his frown; and the mere <HI>external</HI> deference only, which is paid to his authority,
<PB N="53" REF="023176_0062_0FBDE2E42EEF2300">prove that his throne is tottering from its ba&s;e, and, like all other human things, approaching to its di&s;&s;olution. Thus is our holy religion founded on a rock, again&s;t which the winds and waves of infidelity beat in vain. Proud men may rea&s;on, and wicked men pretend to doubt, but <Q>the very gates of hell &s;hall not prevail again&s;t it.</Q></P>

<P>WONDER not at the diver&s;ity of opinions in religion. It has been from the <HI>beginning,</HI> and will continue to be the ca&s;e, to the <HI>end,</HI> of the world.&mdash; Men will never have the &s;ame religious &s;entiments, till you can give them the very &s;ame <HI>natural</HI> di&s;po|&s;itions of humility, candour, teachablene&s;s; the &s;ame capacity, education, acquaintance, or even the &s;ame &s;et of feat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">es or the &s;ame complexion.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of the church, from the fir&s;t mo|ment, to the pre&s;ent, is an hi&s;tory of the&s;e diffen|&s;ions. So &s;oon as Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles di&s;appean|ed, men mixed <Q>tares of human opinion with this good &s;eed of the word.</Q> Even two of the&s;e apo&s;tles had a &s;harp contention, and the &s;pirit has never vani&s;hed from their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>There has been the &s;ame fa&s;hion in religions opinions, as in common things. Particular notions
<PB N="54" REF="023176_0063_0FBDE2E5AC8EEBE0">have been abetted, laid a&s;ide, re&s;umed and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed again, under different names and leaders, exactly like the varying modes of dre&s;s, furniture or en|tertainments.</P>
<P>Nor is this the lea&s;t impeachment of our holy religion. The truth of that, like the God, whence it comes, is the "&s;ame ye&s;terday, to-day and for ever." It is re&s;erved, as the privilege of a more glorious era, that all men &s;hall be of one <Q>heart and of one &s;oul and keep the unity of the &s;pirit in the bond of peace.</Q></P>
<P>In all <HI>human</HI> &s;y&s;tems of faith, there mu&s;t be er|ror. Where error is <HI>involuntary,</HI> and &s;prings from no <HI>criminal</HI> pa&s;&s;ions, but only from a weakne&s;s or <HI>mi&s;direction</HI> of judgment, the Almighty, who look|eth chiefly at the heart, doubtle&s;s will forgive. Charity, in the mean time, is the great bond of union, among&s;t all parties. <Q>They &s;hall come from the ea&s;t, and from the we&s;t, and &s;it down in the kingdom of God.</Q> If we hope to be companions in glory, we <Q>&s;hould not &s;urely fall out by the way.</Q></P>
<P>The chri&s;tian blood, which has &s;tained &s;o many ages of the church, has flowed from the mo&s;t <HI>ma|lignant</HI> and &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ions. The go&s;pel breathes nothing but univer&s;al love, and candour and for|bearance. <Q>Ye know not what manner of &s;pir|it ye are of,</Q> is the mild rebuke to every per&s;e|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tor, that would &s;lay with the &s;word.</P>

You will thus be able to form &s;ome comparative idea of their merits or de|fects; you will not be &s;o likely to be "to&s;&s;ed a|bout with every bla&s;t of vain doctrine," and you will never feel your&s;elf at a lo&s;s, in company, when they become the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation.</P>
<P><HI>Pagan</HI> are tho&s;e who are wholly unenlightened with revelation, and wor&s;hip <HI>idols,</HI> in&s;tead of the true God. The&s;e idols have been various, as the caprices or imaginations of the people among&s;t whom they are found; &s;ometimes fictitious beings, &s;uch as Jupiter, Apollo, Mercury, Mars, Juno, Venus, Minerva, &amp;c. &s;ometimes, good qualities per&s;onified; Faith, Hope, Victory, Concord; &s;ometimes animals, as Serpents, Crocodiles, &amp;c. or even vegetables; as Leek, Onion, Garlic. The&s;e la&s;t were objects of adoration among&s;t the Egyptians.</P>
<P>Before the appearance of Chri&s;t, almo&s;t the whole world was covered with pagani&s;m. All the learning and politene&s;s of Athens and of Rome could not di&s;pel this ignorance. It has only vani&s;hed <Q>where the &s;un of righteou&s;ne&s;s has ap|peared with healing in his wings.</Q></P>
<P>An ingenious writer has &s;aid, that, if we divide <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> known countries of the globe into thirty equal

<P>MAHOMETANS are &s;o called from being followers of the great impo&s;tor, Mahomet. This extraordinary man was born at Mecca, in Arabia, about the middle of the &s;ixth century; and, in his fortieth year, after &s;ome time previou&s;ly &s;pent in the &s;ilence, retirement and au&s;terity of a cave, pre&s;umed to &s;tile him&s;elf, <HI>the Apo&s;tle of God;</HI> pre|tended to have received from heaven, a new and a <HI>la&s;t</HI> revelation, which was to illu&s;trate and in|force, what had been mi&s;taken or perverted, in the <HI>chri&s;tian,</HI> by the lap&s;e of time or the &s;ophi&s;try of men.

To give them <HI>plau&s;ibility,</HI> they are interper&s;ed with &s;ome chri&s;tian doctrines, but, at the &s;ame time, carry a mo&s;t artful <HI>addre&s;s</HI> to the pa&s;&s;ions; allow|ing polygamy, and de&s;cribing the future paradi&s;e, as con&s;i&s;ting <HI>principally,</HI> of <HI>&s;en&s;ual</HI> plea&s;ures; &s;plen|did, &s;ilken garments; rivers of water, wine, milk, honey; mu&s;ic, fea&s;ting and mo&s;t beautiful wo|men.</P>
<P>Mahomet was a man of great talents and ambi|tion. He had no view, but to render him&s;elf the &s;ole and formidable monarch of an exten&s;ive em|pire. <HI>Religion</HI> was made the <HI>in&s;trument</HI> for exe|cuting his wicked and tyrannical de&s;igns.

<P>The <HI>outline</HI> of it was &s;ketched by the hands of a great ma&s;ter.

<P>DISSENTER is a <HI>vague</HI> word, which, in its full latitude, may be applied to <HI>all,</HI> who differ from the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion. <HI>Originally,</HI> how|ever, it meant only one kind of people, <HI>then</HI> di&s;|tingui&s;hed by the name of pre&s;byterians, who ra|ther di&s;&s;ented from the <HI>di&s;cipline</HI> and <HI>polity,</HI> than the <HI>opinions,</HI> of the church. The&s;e, in general, embraced the <HI>&s;entiments</HI> of Calvin, relating to foreknowledge, divine decrees, irre&s;i&s;tible grace, prede&s;tination, reprobation, &amp;c. They di&s;claimed epi&s;copacy, and their government was ve&s;ted in
<PB N="63" REF="023176_0072_0FBDE2F3300BF8F8">pre&s;byters and &s;ynods. The word <HI>pre&s;byter,</HI> means an elder, and <HI>&s;ynod,</HI> an eccle&s;ia&s;tical council or a&s;|&s;embly.</P>
<P>The <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> race of di&s;&s;enters may be &s;trictly &s;ubdivided into two cla&s;&s;es; tho&s;e who &s;till retain the doctrines of Calvin, and his mode of di&s;cipline, and call them&s;elves, from their form of govern|ment, <HI>Independants;</HI> and &s;uch as a&s;&s;ume the more &s;pecious title of prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters. The fir&s;t are extremely rigid and puritanical in their out|ward deportment; but they do not breathe all the <HI>&s;weetne&s;s</HI> of piety, not are their annals un&s;tained with in&s;tances of intolerance and per&s;ecution.&mdash; Their <HI>leader</HI> was a furious and unrelenting bigot.

<P>I do not know that the latter kind of di&s;&s;enters have any <HI>&s;ettled</HI> code of faith. <Q>Every mini&s;ter has a p&s;alm of his own, has a doctrine, has an interpretation,</Q> &s;o that very <HI>oppo&s;ite</HI> &s;entiments may be con&s;i&s;tently delivered by different per&s;ons, in the &s;ame pulpit.

<P>THE methodi&s;ts are <HI>comparatively</HI> a new &s;ect, and &s;prung up about &s;ixty years ago, under the au&s;pices of John We&s;ley, and George Whitfield, then &s;tudents at Oxford.

<P>They have been long divided into two cla&s;&s;es according to the different principles, e&s;pou&s;ed by their leaders. The fir&s;t follow the opinions of Arminius, under the guidance of We&s;ley, who is <HI>&s;till</HI> a very venerable looking patriarch, at their head; and the other, believing divine decrees, foreknowledge, reprobation and election, are more &s;trictly members of the kirk, (only that they do not admit its di&s;cipline) having long &s;ince lo&s;t their <HI>original</HI> director.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">George Whitfield. Both before and &s;ince his death, the Counte&s;s of Huntingdon has been a per&s;on of great in|fluence among this latter cla&s;s of Methodi&s;ts.</NOTE></P>
<P>I do not know, that the methodi&s;ts, (particu|larly they, who follow We&s;ley,) are di&s;&s;enters
<PB N="65" REF="023176_0074_0FBDE2F62DBD9C28">from the e&s;tabli&s;hment, further than in having &s;eparate meetings to inkindle and in&s;pirit the zeal of their followers; a circum&s;tance, which they conceive to be much neglected by the <HI>regular</HI> cler|gy. They are baptized with <HI>us;</HI> attend our &s;er|vices and &s;acrament; admire our liturgy; and only blame us for our lukewarmne&s;s and want of ener|gy and animation. This cen&s;ure, it is true, comes but with a very ill grace from &s;uch a people; but, I fear, we cannot ea&s;ily refute it.</P>
<P>They had <HI>originally</HI> a great &s;hare of <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m.</HI>&mdash; But it is greatly &s;oftened by the indulgence they have received, and mellowed down by time. They are no longer, a new; they are no longer a <HI>per&s;e|cuted</HI> &s;ect.</P>
<P>The journals of We&s;ley, written in the infancy of his career, are a &s;trange medley of goodne&s;s and enthu&s;ia&s;m. The old man has lived long enough to have &s;een his error. That glow of imaginati|on is con&s;iderably abated, which mi&s;took &s;hadows for &s;ub&s;tance, and made fiction pa&s;s for truth.</P>
<P>The great error among&s;t this people, is their employing &s;uch low, illiterate men as their in|&s;tructors, and fancying them under the <HI>immediate</HI> guidance of divine in&s;piration&mdash;preaching up the nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>in&s;tantaneous</HI> conver&s;ion and ju&s;tificati|on by a &s;ort of <HI>miracle</HI>&mdash;making faith to con&s;i&s;t in a <HI>full a&s;&s;urance</HI> of &s;alvation, and denouncing dam|nation again&s;t tho&s;e, who have it not in this &s;uper|eminent degree&mdash;and la&s;tly, in &s;uppo&s;ing this a&s;|&s;urance to depend on certain, <HI>inward extraordinary</HI> impul&s;es, rather than the &s;criptures.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;entiments lead many <HI>artful</HI> people into a wicked pretence of feelings and a&s;&s;urances, which they <HI>have not;</HI> others of <HI>warm imagination</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

<P>The Saviour, doubtle&s;s, can forgive &s;ins to <HI>whom,</HI> and at <HI>whatever moment,</HI> he plea&s;es. A thief, upon the cro&s;s, was a <HI>miracle</HI> of his mercy; but this is not the <HI>ordinary</HI> method of his provi|dence; there are, undoubtedly, thou&s;ands of ex|cellent people, who pa&s;s through the world with|out &s;uch a full <HI>a&s;&s;urance</HI> of faith; and the &s;piritual life, like that of animals or vegetables, is <HI>generally</HI> progre&s;&s;ive.

<P>The methodi&s;ts were, <HI>once,</HI> extremely lavi&s;h in their cen&s;ures of others; but ju&s;tice obliges me to confe&s;s, that they are now in general, an harmle&s;s, inoffen&s;ive and pious people. If they be <HI>gloomy,</HI> it is their <HI>own</HI> misfortune; if they go mourning all their days, <HI>theirs</HI> is the &s;orrow; the world in general, is too di&s;&s;ipated and unreflecting.</P>
<P>As to their leader, he is doubtle&s;s a prodigy.&mdash; Whatever be the merit or demerit of his opinions, his indefatigable labours, activity, pilgrimages, zeal, and re&s;olution challenge our amazement. An old man of nearly ninety ri&s;ing con&s;tantly at four o'clock in the depth of winter, preaching <HI>frequently,</HI> on the &s;ame day, journeying from place to place, <Q>and from one people to another kindom;</Q> him&s;elf the bi&s;hop, &s;ecretary, judge, governor of his people, the main &s;pring of &s;uch a va&s;t, and <HI>complicated</HI> machine, is a phenomenon, that will vani&s;h from our earthly horizon, when he cea&s;es to exi&s;t.

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the religious zeal, which works wonders in his favour, and the deference natural|ly paid to the <HI>fir&s;t founder</HI> of a &s;ect, particularly when po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any genius or learning, yet his <HI>peaceful</HI> government of &s;o numerous a people, for &s;uch a length of time, is a proof of extraordinary talents and addre&s;s.

<P>THE my&s;tic theology boa&s;ts &s;ome great names. Madame de Guion was a warm e&s;pou&s;er of it in France; a woman of great fa&s;hion and con&s;e|quence, remarkable for the goodne&s;s of her heart, and the regularity of her conduct, but of a capri|cious un&s;ettled temper, and liable to the &s;eductions of a warm imagination.</P>
<P>The opinions of this lady made a great noi&s;e in that country, about the year 1687. They were confuted, &s;ome time afterwards, by the celebra|ted Bo&s;&s;uet. The great and good Fenelon under|took her vindication; but his book was condem|ned by Pope Innocent the twelfth.</P>
<P>The Teutonic philo&s;opher (Jacob Behemen,) was a kind of father to this &s;ect, and publi&s;hed a book, which contains a &s;y&s;tem of the mo&s;t ab&s;urd and incoherent reveries, that perhaps ever gained an admi&s;&s;ion into the world. It is a &s;pecies of moral chymi&s;try, and occult philo&s;ophy, a bewil|dering explanation, and a cloudy light, which I will venture to &s;ay, that neither Sir I&s;aac Newton, nor Mr. Locke, with all their clearne&s;s of concep|tion, could have been able to under&s;tand.</P>
<P>Law, who wrote the Serious Call (a nonjuror of Northampton&s;hire), was an abettor of the&s;e doc|trines; a man of very exemplary life, and di&s;|criminating talents; but it was an honour, re&s;erv|ed for the late Baron Swedenborg to carry them to their very height of perfection<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tho&s;e who embrace the tenets of Baron Swedenborg, have very lately begun to form them&s;elves into a &s;eparate connexion, under the name of the New Jeru&s;alem Church.</NOTE>.

<P>What is the inference? When <HI>imagination</HI> is permitted to u&s;urp the place of <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> fanatici&s;m becomes a chri&s;tian duty, and enthu&s;ia&s;m the more <HI>credible,</HI> in proportion as it exceeds all bounds of <HI>credibility.</HI></P>
<P>What can induce men of <HI>&s;en&s;e</HI> to hearken to the&s;e dreams? Early prejudices, confined reading, &s;ingular acquaintance, a reclu&s;e life, a gloomy. &s;peculative, ab&s;tracted turn of mind, and a&s;&s;ocia|ting together, for a long time, particular, how|ever <HI>incongruous,</HI> ideas.</P>
<P>This will account for <HI>any</HI> reveries.

<P>It mu&s;t, however, be &s;aid in favour of the my&s;|tics, that their principles inculcate in the &s;tronge&s;t manner, the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;piritual holine&s;s and re|generation; that their lives in general, are
<PB N="77" REF="023176_0086_0FBDE30923ECF1F8">unblemi&s;hed and exemplary. They are a quiet, retired people, who let the world go as it <HI>will,</HI> as to riches or promotions; who enjoy indeed, in a pa&s;&s;ive <HI>&s;uperiority,</HI> tho&s;e tumults of the crowd, as higher &s;pirits may <HI>conde&s;cend</HI> to look down, with a pitying &s;mile, on the toils of mortals; and who deny them&s;elves all the gayer plea&s;ures, in order to reli&s;h, in a &s;ublimer degree, all the raptures of devotion.</P>
<P>If the opinions of the quieti&s;ts &s;pring from &s;pi|ritual pride, it is more than they &s;u&s;pect; for they preach up the deepe&s;t &s;elf-aba&s;ement, anni|hilation, and poverty of &s;pirit; they almo&s;t &s;tarve the <HI>animal</HI> part of their nature, to nur&s;e the <HI>angelic,</HI> and half <HI>live</HI> on meditation.</P>
<P>If &s;uch people have errors, they &s;hould be touch|ed with a gentle hand. If they are mi&s;led, it is in <HI>amiable</HI> company. There is not a much more lovely name than that of Fenelon. Few men have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch a &s;weetne&s;s of piety.</P>

<P>THE Dei&s;ts are &s;o called, perhaps, from the Latin word, <HI>Deus,</HI> a God; becau&s;e they acknow|ledge only the exi&s;tence of a God, profe&s;s no par|ticular form or &s;y&s;tem of religion, and only follow the law and light of nature.

<P>The fir&s;t de&s;erve an an&s;wer, and it is ea&s;y.

<P>A third cla&s;s of dei&s;ts may be &s;aid to &s;pring up from the &s;uper&s;titions of Rome.

<P>A fourth cla&s;s of dei&s;ts are continually produced by the love of fame, venting it&s;elf in paradoxes, and &s;ingular opinions to make a noi&s;e; by an aver&s;ion to the &s;trictne&s;s of go&s;pel morality, and

<P>The &s;acraments are not ridiculou&s;ly multiplied, nor has <HI>human</HI> policy inveated them.

<P>BOOKS and rules of all kinds are the <HI>theory</HI> of religion, and can have no further u&s;e, than as they lead to <HI>practice.</HI> We have <HI>then</HI> profited by &s;y&s;tems and opinions, when our life is a continual <HI>comment</HI> on what we have read, and we make the light of our example &s;hine before men.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tianity has but two, capital features; love to God, evidenced in acts of piety; and good will towards man, exemplified in all the po&s;&s;ibilities of doing good.

Charity is the <HI>angel,</HI> that binds up the &s;ores of our fellow-crea|tures, heals the broken in heart, clothes the na|ked, and feeds the hungry. The poor are made the repre&s;entatives of Chri&s;t; whatever we give to <HI>them</HI> is, in &s;cripture language, be&s;towed on the <HI>Saviour.</HI> Moth and ru&s;t corrupt the trea&s;ures we hoard up, but this is placed in tho&s;e funds of hea|ven, which never fail.</P>
<P>The Saviour has &s;aid, that <Q>it is more ble&s;&s;ed to give than to receive.</Q> And the plea&s;ures, which &s;pring from charity, prove its origin to be divine. What value has an heap of money, or what con&s;cious dignity do we derive from it, if it is not employed in giving comfort to the mi&s;era|ble, and protection to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed?</P>
<P>The very <HI>poor</HI> are provided for by the laws of the kingdom. And <HI>common</HI> beggars are far from being the mo&s;t de&s;erving objects.

<P>True charity does not &s;o much con&s;i&s;t in multi|plying little alms to a number of poor people, as in making &s;ome grand and well directed efforts in favour of a few. Educating one child of an over|burthened family is a greater act of beneficence, than <HI>retailing</HI> to them, occa&s;ionally, a thou&s;and, <HI>petty</HI> benefactions.

<P>YOUNG ladies have many methods of charity be&s;ides the mere act of giving <HI>money.</HI> That time, which &s;ometimes hangs heavy on their hands, might be u&s;efully employed in making garments for the naked, or providing cordials for the &s;ick.

<P>If I wi&s;hed a woman to be <HI>univer&s;ally</HI> charming, I would recommend this expedient. Compa&s;&s;ion is the highe&s;t excellence of your &s;ex, and charity
<PB N="88" REF="023176_0097_0FBDE1186627CE98">is the &s;acred root from which it &s;prings. The &s;oft bo&s;om of a woman, throbbing with &s;ympathy, or her eye gli&s;tening with cry&s;tal drops of pity, are &s;ome of the fine&s;t touches in nature's pencil. The whole train of accompli&s;hments, the whole group of graces do not exalt her half &s;o much in the e&s;ti|mation of the worthy, the amiable and the di&s;cern|ing. Alas! when death comes, what will be all the accompli&s;hments and graces? But <HI>charity</HI> &s;hall never fail; its plea&s;ures <HI>then</HI> are gaining their meridian of perfection. Remember what the &s;cripture has &s;aid, <Q>alms giving delivereth from death, and will not &s;uffer us to come into dark|ne&s;s.</Q> The young lady you have &s;o frequent|ly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ard me mention, as &s;tanding high in my e&s;|teem, is very eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed by this grace. Nature has been &s;ufficiently kind to her <HI>per&s;on;</HI> but it is not her &s;weet complexion, it is not her flow|ing, unartificial ringlets, it is not the <HI>&s;oftne&s;s</HI> of her voice and manner, or the <HI>mild</HI> lu&s;tre of her eyes, that would have called forth a penegyric from my pen, or touched a brea&s;t, that is con&s;iderably petrified with philo&s;ophy and reflection. It is a conviction that &s;he lives in the con&s;tant exerci&s;e of <HI>piety;</HI> that her excellencies are chiefly tho&s;e of the <HI>mind,</HI> and that her benevolence is bounded on|ly by creation.</P>
<P>When others are at plays or a&s;&s;emblies, <HI>her</HI> fair hands are making garments for the naked, or re|&s;toratives for the &s;ick. The ingenuity, which &s;ome of her &s;i&s;ter females employ to adorn <HI>them|&s;elves,</HI> is con&s;ecrated by <HI>her,</HI> to the &s;ervice of the poor.</P>
<P>This is laying up in &s;tore again&s;t the day of nece&s;&s;ity. This is weaving for her&s;elf a chaplet

<P>ALMS, however, to the <HI>body,</HI> which mu&s;t very &s;oon peri&s;h, are but, if I may &s;o &s;ay, the <HI>thre&s;hold,</HI> of charity. The true <HI>&s;ublime</HI> of it is compa&s;&s;ion to the &s;oul; becau&s;e that is immortal, and can never die.</P>
<P>Every effort to &s;ave <HI>this,</HI> is exalted in its nature, and the neare&s;t approach we can make, in the&s;e hou&s;es of clay, to the mini&s;try of angels, to the attributes of Jehovah, and to the unbounded com|pa&s;&s;ion of him, who died for the &s;ins of all.</P>
<P>A few, timely advices, in&s;tructions or reproofs to tho&s;e, over whom our fortune or &s;tation give us any influence, may have more la&s;ting and bene|ficial con&s;equences, than all the food or raiment,

<P>The in&s;titution of Sunday Schools promi&s;es the happie&s;t con&s;equences to the poor, and the commu|nity at large. It has, indeed, <HI>already</HI> produced a &s;urprizing reformation. The pre&s;ent age beholds the dawn of a ble&s;&s;ed morning, which in another, may brighten into a more perfect day.</P>
<P>If it <HI>fails,</HI> it will be from carele&s;s and indo|lence in the <HI>parents</HI> them&s;elves, or for want of at|tention from the <HI>higher</HI> orders of people. Many, who will give their money, are not equally liberal of their exertion. This grand &s;cheme, however, requires an unremitting labour and vigilance. It is the watchful eye of <HI>&s;uperiors,</HI> which alone will produce exemplarine&s;s in the teachers, or, in the &s;cholars, emulation. And I do not know a great|er charity within the &s;phere of a young lady, than to vi&s;it the girls in the&s;e u&s;eful &s;eminaries, in or|der to correct their foibles, encourage their dawn|ing virtues, and &s;timulate them to improvement. Clo&s;e, uncomfortable rooms, it is true, in <HI>cellars</HI> or <HI>garrets,</HI> poi&s;oned with unplea&s;ant &s;mells, and but filled with <HI>poor children,</HI> are no very inviting objects to tho&s;e, who live in hou&s;es, <Q>cieled with cedar, and painted with vermillion.</Q> But the merit of the action is, doubtle&s;s, in proportion to its unplea&s;antne&s;s; and it is done for him, who on <HI>our</HI> account, refu&s;ed neither hard&s;hip nor di&s;tre&s;s. The&s;e poor children, he has vouch&s;afed to call "his lambs," and it is a mo&s;t chri&s;tian effort to "feed them."</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="023176_0100_0FBDE11CE67D2E10">
Such advice will, doubtle&s;s, &s;ound very &s;trange in the ears of &s;ome young ladies, who dare <Q>&s;carcely &s;et their feet upon the ground for de|licatene&s;s and tenderne&s;s.</Q> But this, alas! is a fal&s;e and over-acted refinement. They were not born merely to vegetate, like tulips, for <HI>o&s;tentation.</HI> The world, their friends, the poor, religion, have claims upon them. All nature, &s;un, moon, &s;tars, tides, preach up the nece&s;&s;ity of continual <HI>action;</HI> and I will venture to &s;ay, that this kind of exertion would be recompen&s;ed with &s;uch a &s;ecret plea&s;ure, as they never found in the gaye&s;t circles of fa&s;hion, or the mo&s;t crowded haunts of di&s;&s;ipation.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR LUCY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE very fir&s;t thing I &s;hould recommend after religious duties, as ab&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential to your private comfort, is <HI>&s;elf-government</HI> in the fulle&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word. This may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be included under the article of religion. And &s;o in fact it is. But there are many well di&s;po&s;ed people, that &s;eem to think little things of this kind almo&s;t beneath their notice, though in reality they are interwoven with the repo&s;e of every day, and almo&s;t every moment.</P>
<P>The di&s;cipline of the <HI>imagination</HI> is the fir&s;t thing to be attempted. This, in young people, is na|turally warm; and if they are not cautious, will be apt to mi&s;lead them into very dangerous errors.</P>
<P>Thus whatever captivates their <HI>fancy,</HI> they take, without examination, to be all over excellence. Tin&s;el, becau&s;e it <HI>glitters</HI> more, will be preferred to &s;olid <HI>gold;</HI> a luxuriant, florid &s;tyle in a writer; to the &s;ounde&s;t and be&s;t arranged arguments; the &s;hewy and brilliant in <HI>characters,</HI> to the truly va|luable, and the gaudy in <HI>dre&s;s,</HI> to that artle&s;s &s;im|plicity, which is the offspring of an elegant and well cultivated ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Young people, almo&s;t univer&s;ally &s;ubject them|&s;elves to this kind of <HI>illu&s;ion.</HI> They enter upon life, as an <HI>inchanted</HI> country. The world, in

What the &s;cripture has called a <HI>wilderne&s;s, they</HI> make a <HI>paradi&s;e,</HI> who&s;e land&s;kips are deliciou&s;ly picture&s;que, and who&s;e &s;pring is ever green.</P>
<P>Experience, be a&s;&s;ured, will not realize &s;uch high expectations. You will find, that every object has its imperfections; that the world at be&s;t is but a mixture of good and ill, and that the lights of the picture will be inter&s;per&s;ed with &s;hades.</P>

<P>THE <HI>next,</HI> mo&s;t important thing is the govern|ment of your <HI>temper.</HI> I know many per&s;ons, that would not, for the world, be ab&s;ent from the &s;acra|ment, or refu&s;e to do a generous action, yet in|dulge them&s;elves, &s;eemingly without remor&s;e, in

<P>Such people &s;hould con&s;ider, that religion was intended to reg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ate the mo&s;t <HI>ordinary</HI> actions of our lives; that prayers, &s;acraments, and oppor|tunities of doing <HI>great</HI> good come, comparatively, but &s;eldom; but that it is, every moment, in our power to diffu&s;e happine&s;s among&s;t our dome&s;tics, and that this, if it proceeds from <HI>proper</HI> motives, will be an acceptable &s;ervice to the God, who has appointed all the different ranks in &s;ociety, and is the father of all compa&s;&s;ion. Nor have we much imbibed the true &s;pirit of the go&s;pel, if it has not taught us to bear patiently the imperfections of our fellow-creatures, and to temper authority with gentlene&s;s and good nature.</P>
<P>No <HI>Con&s;equence</HI> can ju&s;tify one &s;ingle act of <HI>ca|price,</HI> &s;ullenne&s;s or ill-humour.

<P>Tyranny is a downright in&s;ult to any creature formed in the image of God; it would be unpar|donable, if exerci&s;ed even to a worm or in&s;ect, and generally proceeds from cau&s;es, which reflect no honour on the heart or under&s;tanding.

The truth is, &s;ome females have been <HI>viragos</HI> in their knowledge, not only injudicious in the <HI>kind</HI> they have a&s;pired to, but the <HI>u&s;e</HI> they have made of it, and an <HI>indi&s;criminate</HI> &s;tigma has been fixed upon all, who have endeavoured <HI>rationally</HI> to improve their under&s;tandings.</P>
<P>On the other hand, it is &s;aid of women, that they are &s;o ignorant, frivolus and in&s;ipid, as to be unfit for friend&s;hip, &s;ociety or conver&s;ation; that they are unable to amu&s;e, entertain or edify a lonely hour, much more to ble&s;s or grace that connexion, for which they were principally formed.</P>

<P>The <HI>elegant</HI> &s;tudies are, more immediately, <HI>your</HI> department. They do not require &s;o much time, ab&s;traction or comprehen&s;ivene&s;s of mind; they bring no wrinkles, and they will give a poli&s;h to your manners, and &s;uch a liberal expan&s;ion to

<P>ROLLIN's ancient hi&s;tory is a trea&s;ure to young people, if the number of volumes does not alarm you. This man was one of the mo&s;t excel|lent preceptors, that the world ever &s;aw. It was his ambition to <HI>unite</HI> the &s;cholar, and the chri&s;tian. He labours to promote religious improvement by every incident, he relates. He holds forth Provi|dence, as continually &s;uperintending the govern|ment of the univer&s;e, and its finger, as directing all the <HI>movements</HI> of the &s;y&s;tem; and, when he has related a number of &s;urprizing vici&s;&s;itudes and events, he takes his pupil up <Q>to an high moun|tain, from whence he &s;hows him all the king|doms of the world, and all the glories of them</Q> to be continually under the control and direction of heaven, and not <HI>collectively</HI> to po&s;&s;e&s;s half the lu&s;tre of the excellence of one, pious di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Under the pen of this mo&s;t chri&s;tia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> writer, eve|ry <HI>ba&s;er</HI> metal is purified from its alloy. Every &s;ounding action is dive&s;ted of its <HI>bomba&s;t,</HI> and tra|ced to its <HI>real</HI> &s;ource. Splendour has no dignity, if una&s;&s;ociated with <HI>virtue.</HI> Ambition is painted
<PB N="105" REF="023176_0114_0FBDE131E372C0B8">as a <HI>fury,</HI> that de&s;troys. Heroi&s;m is repre&s;ented, as <HI>murder</HI> in di&s;gui&s;e. The laurels of an Alexan|der are wre&s;ted from his brow. Cae&s;ar is &s;tripped of his fictitious plumage. They are both de&s;cri|bed, as vultures, preying on their &s;pecies, who were born to be only the <HI>&s;courges</HI> of humanity, and a terror to the world.</P>
<P>This man de&s;erves univer&s;al veneration. His pupils &s;hould have rai&s;ed a monument to his me|mory, and po&s;terity have rendered that monument <HI>immortal.</HI> Learning and religion &s;hould be group|ed over his tomb, mingling their united tears for the lo&s;s of his virtues.</P>
<P>If you have not lei&s;ure to peru&s;e his writings, yet be careful to read all <HI>other</HI> hi&s;tory with <HI>this</HI> view, and it will lead you to God. It will teach you, no longer, to be dazzled with grandeur, be|cau&s;e grandeur fades away. It will &s;how you, that vices have demoli&s;hed the mightie&s;t empires, and &s;wept the fine&s;t cities "with the be&s;om of de&s;truction." It will convince you, that every thing on earth is a &s;hadow, and that neither men nor nations "continue in one &s;tay." It will a&s;&s;ure you, that, <Q>though clouds and darkne&s;s may be about the throne of God, yet righteou&s;ne&s;s and judgment are the habitation of his &s;eat.</Q> It will in&s;truct you, that <HI>every</HI> action is "weighed in its balance;" that, however, <HI>&s;eemingly,</HI> di&s;regard|ed for a <HI>time,</HI> vice and virtue will have their ju&s;t proportion of puni&s;hment or reward, and that noth|ing but <HI>religion</HI> will be able to triumph, amid&s;t the cru&s;h of elements, of matter, and the world.</P>

<P>THOUGH I think every woman in the world &s;hould execrate the memory of the late Lord Che&s;terfield, as having written the mo&s;t &s;candalous libels on her &s;ex, yet his &s;ketches of heathen my|thology, of Grecian, Roman, and Briti&s;h hi&s;tory, in the fir&s;t volume of his letters, are well worth your attention. If this ingenious nobleman had given us more &s;pecimens of <HI>this</HI> nature, and fewer lectures on <HI>the graces</HI> and <HI>intrigue,</HI> the gratitude of po&s;terity would have <HI>imbalmed</HI> his a&s;hes. He was certainly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an elegant &s;tyle, and had a very happy method of conveying his in&s;tructions.</P>
<P>But in order to make any real improvement in this, or any <HI>other</HI> of your &s;tudies, let me advi&s;e you to read only one half hour, at a time, and to employ a <HI>double</HI> &s;pace, in abridging and expre&s;&s;ing what you recollect, in your <HI>own</HI> language. This will have the double advantage of impre&s;&s;ing it very &s;trongly on your memory, and enabling you to form a &s;tyle of your own.</P>
<P>Though a good &s;tyle is, doubtle&s;s, a mark of genius, and not attainable by every per&s;on, yet it depends amazingly on <HI>mechanical</HI> habit, as well as our gait, countenance or ge&s;ture.

But who does not know, that favourites, at <HI>any</HI> rate, will be de|&s;ended?</P>
<P>But indeed all men of &s;en&s;e <HI>unite</HI> in paying a &s;incere tribute of re&s;pect to the memory of John|&s;on.

<P>John&s;on in all his multipled productions, has not a &s;ingle period, that can patronize indecency, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> unhinge belief.

<PB N="109" REF="023176_0118_0FBDE137E510FF98">has carefully endeavoured to diffu&s;e happine&s;s, as widely as his writings, and to render piety diffu|&s;ive as his fame.

<P>If all the <HI>private</HI> anecdotes of every per&s;on's life and temper mu&s;t be arraigned before the tribunal of the public, who could e&s;cape?

<PB N="110" REF="023176_0119_0FBDE139677F8AB0">&s;hine in biographical writing. It is quite in <HI>their</HI> province, and forms a part of the national ta&s;te. Their imagination &s;parkles, in an e&s;pecial manner, in painting the complexion of courts, monarchs or per&s;onages of di&s;tinction. <HI>They</HI> feel as great an ardour for extolling the virtues of their <HI>le roi</HI> and his attendants, as <HI>we</HI> do for recording all the great atchievements of the field or ocean.</P>
<P>The Marquis Caraccioli is univer&s;ally known, as an author of great vivacity and talents. He has written the life of Pope Clement XIV. and it does honour to his pen, as well as to the memory of the &s;overeign pontiff.</P>
<P>If the Marquis really wrote the letters, which go under the name of Ganganelli, he has hit off, with a wonderful addre&s;s, the air and features of the illu&s;trious original. The habits, &s;entiments, man|ners and di&s;po&s;ition of the Pope, as couched in this life, all breathe through the&s;e letters.</P>
<P>The name of Dr. John&s;on, and the intimacy known to have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted betwixt the parties, have given a great currency to Mrs. Piozzi's anecdotes, relating to this literary hero. But they have not <HI>immortalized</HI> either her talents, or the goodne&s;s of her heart. They are a mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting &s;pecimen of treachery in friend&s;hip; a copious effu&s;ion of <HI>&s;pleen,</HI> that had <HI>long</HI> been collecting. They re|mind one forcibly of a number of little in&s;ects, nimbling at their ea&s;e, on the <HI>carca&s;e</HI> of &s;ome no|ble animal, that a <HI>&s;ingle</HI> motion of the <HI>living</HI> crea|ture would have di&s;per&s;ed in an in&s;tant, or cru&s;hed into atoms.</P>

<P>WRAXALL is a very agreeable author, and he has cho&s;en a fruitful, happy &s;ubject, in his Memoirs of the Kings of France, of the Hou&s;e of Valois. The execution is not inferior to the judiciou&s;ne&s;s of the de&s;ign. His book has an ad|mirer in every per&s;on of &s;entiment and ta&s;te.</P>
<P>The late Mr. Sheridan is allowed to have po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed con&s;iderable abilities. He has given the world a &s;pecimen of them in his life of Swift. It is, however, in my idea, too flattering a portrait. The painter was a countryman, and an admirer. No talents can convert deformity into beauty, or make darkne&s;s to be light.</P>
<P>Swift was a very great, original genius; but the indecency of &s;ome of his writings is intolera|ble; his &s;pleen, exce&s;&s;ive, and his behaviour to Stella an <HI>eternal</HI> &s;tigma on his memory and his virtues. Ever dabbling in the turbid ocean of politics, what bu&s;ine&s;s had he with the quiet and retired haven of the church? But genius and ta|lents can embelli&s;h any &s;ide of a &s;ubject, and the biographer has poured, on his favourite author, a deluge of panegyric.</P>
<P>The life of Garrick is &s;o much inter&s;per&s;ed with the <HI>dome&s;tic</HI> hi&s;tory, and the mo&s;t illu&s;trious per&s;ons of his time, that it will highly engage and gratify your curio&s;ity. It is written by Davies in two volumes.</P>
<P>England has long laboured with a di&s;order, that I cannot call by a better name, than the <HI>theatrical
<PB N="112" REF="023176_0121_0FBDE13C796081D0">mania.</HI> A principal actor is more di&s;tingui&s;hed, care&s;&s;ed and enriched by a luxurious nation, than many of the mo&s;t de&s;erving per&s;ons, in the learn|ed profe&s;&s;ions. An Abingdon, a Siddons, and a Mara (as once a Garrick, a Hender&s;on, and a Yates,) inchant the feelings of a Briti&s;h audience, drain the money which &s;hould be &s;acred to better purpo&s;es, acquire, in a few years, an indepen|dent fortune and are admitted to the fir&s;t circles in the kingdom, whil&s;t a thou&s;and, amiable and me|ritorious clergymen are &s;uffered to live in want, and to die in the mo&s;t uncomfortable ob&s;curity. This is not a very favourable trait in the <HI>moral</HI> hi&s;tory of a nation. It &s;eems rather a &s;ymptom of its approaching di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>Hume was a great champion of infidelity, and as &s;uch, a character, that excites uncommon curio|&s;ity. He has written his own life, and, as an unique in biography, it is worthy your reading.</P>
<P>Bolingbroke was another of the <HI>&s;ceptical</HI> family. His hi&s;tory is agreeably recorded by Dr. Gold|&s;mith.</P>
<P>On the &s;ubject of biography, you will meet with a great variety of other, entertaining writers; but I mu&s;t not clo&s;e this article, without particularly recommending a book, that has given me &s;o much plea&s;ure and information, as the life and writings of Gray, by Mr. Ma&s;on.</P>
<P>A particular friend&s;hip of the warme&s;t and mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted kind, &s;ub&s;i&s;ted betwixt the&s;e celebrat|ed authors. It commenced in that early period of life, when &s;ouls are incapable of guile or &s;elfi&s;h|ne&s;s and mutally <HI>expand;</HI> and Ma&s;on has endeav|oured to immortalize it in a manner, which does equal credit to his heart and under&s;tanding.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="023176_0122_0FBDE13DE61E8B80">
The hi&s;tory of a retired, literary per&s;on cannot, generally, pre&s;ent much variety of entertainment. But in the character of Gray, there is &s;omewhat very <HI>intere&s;ting;</HI> and his friend has di&s;played it to the greate&s;t advantage. No man, perhaps, by &s;uch <HI>&s;light</HI> &s;ketches, as the author of an Elegy in a country church-yard has left behind him, ever acquired &s;o exten&s;ive a reputation. And there was a dignity, a &s;oftne&s;s and a delicacy in his <HI>whole</HI> manner of thinking and acting, which com|pen&s;ate for the want of more remarkable anec|dotes, and of more &s;ounding connexions.</P>

<P><Q>THERE is not (&s;ays a &s;en&s;ible writer,) a &s;on or daughter of Adam, who has not &s;ome concern in the knowledge of Geography.</Q> It is nece&s;|&s;ary to your under&s;tanding the connexion, which this globe has with the other planetary &s;y&s;tem, and with all the wonderful works of God. It is indi&s;|pen&s;ible to your comprehending hi&s;tory, or having a proper idea of the events and tran&s;actions it re|lates, as well as to dive&s;t your mind of little, nar|row prejudices by giving you a view of the cu&s;|toms, manners, ceremonies and in&s;titutions of all the different nations over the world.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="023176_0123_0FBDE13F729BB040">
A celebrated writer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Che&s;terfield.</NOTE> has called geography and chronology, the two <HI>eyes</HI> of hi&s;tory; the fir&s;t in|forms you <HI>where</HI> events happened, and the latter, at what particular <HI>period;</HI> if it was not for the&s;e helps your reading would be a confu&s;ed chaos, without order, light or per&s;picuity.</P>
<P>Geography is, indeed, &s;o much attended to at all &s;chools, that there is little occa&s;ion to dwell on its nece&s;&s;ity; if you have learned the u&s;e of the globes, and the divi&s;ion of it by names, which are only <HI>fancied</HI> for the &s;ake of reducing the immen&s;ity of it to the narrow &s;cale of human comprehen&s;ion, the be&s;t method, I know, is never to read the name of a place in a common news paper, or any other hi&s;tory, without immediately recurring to authorities for the &s;ituation and divi&s;ion of the country in which it lies, the manners of the in|habitants, their ceremonies, civil government, and religious in&s;titutions. It is this mode of &s;tudying from the <HI>urgency</HI> of the occa&s;ion, which gives energy to our re&s;earches and vigour to improve|ment.</P>
<P>Guthrie is one of the be&s;t authors in geography; and for chronology, the tables of Dr. Prie&s;tley (a name, which I would only mention, where &s;cience and not <HI>religion,</HI> is concerned,) are &s;o compendious and comprehen&s;ive, as to afford you, on a &s;ingle glance, con&s;iderable information. There is no &s;pecies of knowledge, that is &s;o ea&s;ily attained, as that of geography: nor any of which the want is more flagrant and awkward.</P>
<P>I lately blu&s;hed for a young lady, who was a&s;ked in company, the latitude and &s;ituation of a
<PB N="115" REF="023176_0124_0FBDE140ED193E08">particular place, which happened to be mention|ed in the public papers of the day. She was dre&s;&s;|ed in the highe&s;t ta&s;te. The ro&s;es and carnations vied in her countenance. She piques her&s;elf on her &s;martne&s;s and vivacity; but in this in&s;tance, could make no reply. Her <HI>embarra&s;&s;ment</HI> betray|ed her ignorance, and <HI>politene&s;s</HI> relieved it by a change of conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>How much higher would her character have &s;tood in the e&s;timation of all &s;entible and di&s;cern|ing men, if &s;he had come down &s;tairs, dre&s;&s;ed in an elegant plainne&s;s, and, in&s;tead of &s;tanding &s;o long before her gla&s;s, had devoted &s;ome little &s;hare of her time to this &s;pecies of improvement. Not that I have any objection to a blu&s;h upon a wo|man's cheek.

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR LUCY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NATURAL hi&s;tory is another &s;tudy, which I conceive to be particularly <HI>feminine.</HI> It has, of late, been cultivated with uncommon attention. Botany has been, particularly, fa&s;hionable. It has found a place in the amu&s;ements of the elegant,
<PB N="116" REF="023176_0125_0FBDE14267249588">as well as the learned. Nothing is more calculated to amu&s;e the mind, improve the health and &s;pirits, and to in&s;pire at once cheerfulne&s;s and devotion.</P>
<P>The &s;uprizing hi&s;tory of plants and flowers, the immen&s;e variety, the mechani&s;m, order, government and economy of animals, fowls with their plumage and fi&s;hes with their &s;cales, fo&s;&s;ils, minerals, petrefactions, mountains, vallies, vol|canos, all nature full of life, full of happine&s;s and full of miracles, will crowd your mind with the &s;ublime&s;t images, and teach you to adore the great, almighty former and pre&s;erver of the world. What beauty in each flower! What traits of divine wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s in an in&s;ect! Surveyed with a truly philo&s;ophical eye, the whole creation is a temple! Not a &s;hrub, but is eloquent, not an ani|malcule, but is a powerful monitor of virtue!</P>
<P>I never &s;pend an afternoon with Mi&s;s Loui&s;a &mdash;without being both in&s;tructed and delighted. I never take a walk with her in the garden, but &s;he unfolds a thou&s;and, natural curio&s;ities, which had hitherto e&s;caped my un&s;cienced or inattentive eyes. I never ramble with her into the fields, but &s;he gives me &s;uch an hi&s;tory of the mo&s;t common plants and flowers, as at once &s;urprizes my curio&s;i|ty, and gratifies my ta&s;te. In her clo&s;et &s;he has a large collection of in&s;ects, which her micro&s;cope clothes with mo&s;t exqui&s;ite beauty, and a mu&s;eum, filedd with &s;hells, corals, and petrefactions, the &s;parkling of which is exceeded by nothing, but the vivacity of her eyes, or the &s;tronger or more per|manent lu&s;tre of her virtues.</P>
<P>I would infinitely rather have her ta&s;te, than her fortune. And I never quit her without &s;e|cretly envying her enjoyments. She is ever
<PB N="117" REF="023176_0126_0FBDE143E7852C18">&s;prightly, becau&s;e &s;he has never a moment <HI>unem|ployed.</HI> She always <HI>&s;miles,</HI> becau&s;e &s;he is always innocent. Her plea&s;ures are of the rational and <HI>refined</HI> kind. They never leave a thorn in the heart, or pluck one, blu&s;hing ro&s;e from her cheeks. How &s;olid and how calm, if compared with the midnight revels of fa&s;hion, or the giddine&s;s of ad|miration!</P>
<P>Be like Loui&s;a, my dear girl, and you will al|ways be happy. Study nature, till it leads you up to nature's God. Pore on plants and flowers, till they perfume you with a <HI>real</HI> devotion; and I will engage you to become, in your turn, one of the mo&s;t beautiful flowers in the creation.</P>

<P>NATURAL hi&s;tory is divided into three grand parts, as it re&s;pects the animal, the mineral, and the vegetable kingdoms, and under the&s;e different ar|ticles, a&s;&s;umes the name of zoology, or an hi&s;tory of animals; lithology, or a de&s;cription of &s;tones, fo&s;&s;ils, &amp;c. and botany, or an account of herbs, plants, flowers. The&s;e again have, each their re&s;|pective &s;ubdivi&s;ions.</P>
<P>Linnaeus, who was born at Up&s;al, is the great father of this &s;cience, and from the Swedi&s;h &s;chool have i&s;&s;ued the works of the mo&s;t eminent ma&s;ters. But he is too voluminous and &s;cientific for a female, who wants only a <HI>general</HI> knowledge
<PB N="118" REF="023176_0127_0FBDE1456422B3B0">of nature, and not to penetrate the minutiae of her plan.</P>
<P>The <HI>Amaenitates Academicae</HI> are a number of ingenious e&s;&s;ays on a variety of &s;ubjects, &s;elected from the works of the mo&s;t capital di&s;ciples of the Linnaean &s;chool. Some of tho&s;e have been tran&s;lated by Stillingfleet, under the name of Tracts on Natural Hi&s;tory, and are very valuable and in&s;tructive; 'others by Brand, in two volumes, which contain a number of very curious and en|tertaining de&s;criptions.</P>
<P>Pulteny's View of the Works of Linnaeus you may read, likewi&s;e, with great plea&s;ure and im|provement. Next to the&s;e I &s;hould recommend to a mere Engli&s;h reader, the works of Ray: him, who wrote "The wi&s;dom of God in the creation." They are highly u&s;eful and valuable, though writ|ten before this &s;tudy had arrived to its pre&s;ent &s;tate of perfection.</P>
<P>Gold&s;mith's Hi&s;tory of the Earth and animated Nature is but a mere compilation. Still it may have its u&s;e, as affording &s;ome <HI>collateral</HI> lights and in&s;truction.</P>
<P>Buffon is an author of fir&s;t rate abilities. His &s;tyle is &s;plendid; his knowledge is exten&s;ive, and his eloquence, in a high degree, brilliant and &s;e|ducing. But I cannot recommend him for many rea&s;ons. He is too <HI>voluminous;</HI> the exten&s;ivene&s;s of his plan leads him into a great variety of detail, and of <HI>inddicate</HI> de&s;criptions. He is more attached to &s;y&s;tems of his own, than the di&s;covery of trath; and he is a &s;ort of <HI>&s;ceptic,</HI> who re&s;olves every thing into a chain of <HI>&s;econdary</HI> cau&s;es, and <HI>&s;acrilegiou&s;ly</HI> excludes the Deity from his creation. This tem|per is the <HI>bane</HI> of <HI>modern</HI> philo&s;ophers. They en|deavour
<PB N="119" REF="023176_0128_0FBDE146E6C4A308">to account for <HI>every</HI> thing upon <HI>natural</HI> principles, and wherever they are puzzled, ridicu|lou&s;ly di&s;believe. In&s;tead of making their know|ledge, a &s;caffolding to God, they build on it, a monument to their own vanity and folly, which will not &s;tand, "when winds and &s;torms ari&s;e." Do people of &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hed abilities need to be reminded, that a world without de&s;ign, or an act|ive machine, without a <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> moving principle, in|volves the greate&s;t and mo&s;t palpable of contradic|tions? Nature, in the hands of a <HI>true</HI> philo&s;opher, reads a continual le&s;&s;on of piety; in tho&s;e of a <HI>fal&s;e</HI> one, it is the parent of &s;ceptici&s;m, gloom and de&s;pair. Sir I&s;aac Newton was the mo&s;t pious of men; many of his <HI>humble</HI> followers have been as impious <HI>retailers</HI> of infidelity.</P>
<P>You will derive great plea&s;ure and improvement from all the writings of Mr. Pennant, and they are numerous. Always lively and always authentic, they entertain the man of ta&s;te, the &s;cholar, and the antiquarian, as well as the naturali&s;t. Few per&s;ons have publi&s;hed &s;o much, in any one de|partment of &s;cience, with &s;o great &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The Flora Londinen&s;is of Curtis is a &s;plendid work, that does credit to the author. It is embel|li&s;hed with beautiful engravings of all the com|mon plants and flowers of this country, and is &s;till in continuation.</P>
<P>Volcanoes are among&s;t the <HI>prodigies</HI> of nature, which fill the mind with the grande&s;t and &s;ublime&s;t images. Hamilton's account of them, and Ra&s;pe on the volcanos in Germany, will a&s;toni&s;h your imagination. You may add to the li&s;t Swammer|dam's Hi&s;tory of In&s;ects, tran&s;lated by Floyd, and revi&s;ed by Dr. Hill.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="023176_0129_0FBDE1486361ADA0">
But I will de&s;i&s;t, for if I was to give you only the <HI>names</HI> of writers on the &s;ubject, they would fill a volume. No private fortune would be &s;uffi|cient to purcha&s;e them, and the peru&s;al would re|quire more time, than would con&s;i&s;t with your other, various engagements.</P>

<P>Nichol&s;on's Introduction to Natural Philo&s;o|phy, in two volumes, octavo, is an excellent book upon this &s;ubject, and Derham's A&s;tro-theology mu&s;t elevate the mind, and improve the heart of every reader. Gregory's A&s;tronomy, and
<PB N="121" REF="023176_0130_0FBDE149E41D25D0">Huygen's Cele&s;tial Worlds di&s;covered, are very u&s;eful and entertaining, and may together form a &s;ufficient library for this department of &s;cience.

<P>POETRY, I do not with you to cultivate, fur|ther than to po&s;&s;e&s;s a <HI>reli&s;h</HI> for its beauties. Ver&s;es, if not excellent, are execrable indeed. The mu&s;es live upon a <HI>mount,</HI> and there is no enjoying any of their favours, unle&s;s you can climb to the heights of Parna&s;&s;us.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides a pa&s;&s;ion for poetry is dangerous to a woman. It heightens her natural &s;en&s;ibility to an extravagant degree, and frequently in&s;pires &s;uch a romantic turn of mind, as is utterly incon|&s;i&s;tent with all the &s;olid duties and proprieties of life.</P>
<P>To increa&s;e the number of <HI>imaginary,</HI> when life abounds with &s;uch <HI>real</HI> &s;orrows, by nur&s;ing a &s;ickly extravagant &s;en&s;ibility, is, in a rational creature, the very height of imprudence. The ancients endeavoured to cheri&s;h fortitude, and re|&s;olution, by giving &s;trength to the body and vigour to the mind. From &s;ome of their &s;tates.
<PB N="122" REF="023176_0131_0FBDE14B65F358E8">poetry, among&s;t other things, was ab&s;olutely <HI>ex|cluded,</HI> as tending to <HI>enervate</HI> the minds of a peo|ple, and unfit them for the &s;truggles and activities of life; and it is certain that the owners of an exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility, for a few <HI>moments</HI> of plea&s;ure, have <HI>days</HI> of vexation. In this human wilderne&s;s, <HI>thorns</HI> are perennials. <HI>Ro&s;es</HI> are but the <HI>peri&s;hable</HI> ornaments of &s;ummer.</P>
<P>The late Mr. shen&s;tone, among&s;t many others, is an unhappy in&s;tance of the misfortune, I have mentioned. His works, though not of the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> magnitude, are exceedingly agreeable; but his poetical enthu&s;ia&s;m was a &s;ource of <HI>perpetual</HI> irri|tation and misfortune. Having cultivated his ta&s;te, more than his prudence, his feelings, more than his fortitude, and his imagination, more than his judgment, his life was one, unvaried train of inquietudes. His mind was ruffled with <HI>imaginary</HI> injuries; his peace di&s;turbed with <HI>fanciful</HI> affronts, and his di&s;ordered finances left him every thing, but comfort, dignity, and independence.</P>
<P>With a fortune, that only ju&s;tified a neat and <HI>homely</HI> dwelling, his genius was not content with le&s;s than the &s;uperb appendages of a palace. In forming the <HI>Lea&s;eowes,</HI> he &s;acrificed to enthu&s;ia&s;m, what he owed to contentment. He panted for a <HI>paradi&s;e,</HI> and a paradi&s;e he had; but it &s;oon be|came a wilderne&s;s of thorns. Mercile&s;s creditors had no candour for the poet, and made no allow|ance for the exqui&s;itene&s;s of his ta&s;te.</P>
<P>They &s;aw no charms in &s;hrubs, in blo&s;&s;oms, or in pro&s;pects, and they awoke him with an iron gra&s;p, from his delicious intrancement. Whil&s;t a noble neighbour, emulating and outvying, on a <HI>larger</HI> &s;cale, the beauties of his ely&s;ium, or exhi|biting

<P>The immortal poem of Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t &s;hould not only be in the <HI>hands,</HI> but graven on the <HI>heart,</HI> of every woman, becau&s;e Milton, above all other authors, de&s;cribes the di&s;tingui&s;hing graces of the &s;ex, and in his Eve, has exhibited an exqui&s;ite pattern of female perfection. On <HI>this</HI> &s;ubject, his feelings were always awakened in an extraordinary manner; his imagination glowed, and he has given it the fine&s;t touches of his pencil.</P>
<P>Milton like all great men, was fully &s;en&s;ible of the ble&s;&s;ings we derive from the &s;ociety of wo|men, and how <HI>cheerle&s;s</HI> the face of nature would have been without them. He, therefore, <HI>labours</HI>
<PB N="124" REF="023176_0133_0FBDE14E9B0A16B0">to make the mother of his Paradi&s;e every thing, that could charm, and every thing that could alle|viate the infelicities of life. Let the libertine read his de&s;cription of marriage, and tell me what he thinks of the prevailing rage for impurity and &s;eduction.</P>
<P>Homer is univer&s;ally celebrated; and, though you cannot read his poem in the original language, Pope has given an admirable tran&s;lation. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of Dryden's Virgil, if you wi&s;h to ta&s;te the exqui&s;ite richne&s;s of the&s;e ancient authors.</P>
<P>Ma&s;on's poems have great merit, and have ac|quired him a con&s;iderable celebrity. His Carac|tacus, his Elfrida, and his Engli&s;h Garden have all been admired. Nothing, however, from his pen, has plea&s;ed me more, than the epitaph upon his lady. His talents &s;eem to be particularly formed for the pen&s;ive and pathetic. But poetry, after all, is but an <HI>embelli&s;hment,</HI> and, in the cha|racter of a <HI>divine,</HI> a very &s;econdary di&s;tinction. How much more important and u&s;eful to man|kind, are the labours of that pa&s;tor, who, by one judicious, impa&s;&s;ioned and well directed di&s;cour&s;e, appals the &s;inner, encourages the faint, revives the drooping, guides the perplexed, or conde|&s;cends to cheer the bed of &s;ickne&s;s with divine con&s;olations!</P>
<P>This remark, however, is not particularly in|tended to depreciate the ingenious author of Ca|ractacus. He is &s;aid to excel likewi&s;e, as a preacher.</P>

<P>IN poetry, the <HI>ladies</HI> have, of late, a&s;&s;erted their claim to genius, and the trampled honours of their under&s;tanding. Several of them appear, in the walks of Parna&s;&s;us, with con&s;iderable lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Seward, in my idea, is a &s;tar of the fir&s;t magnitude in the hemi&s;phere of imagination. She has given us chiefly little, fugitive pieces; a monody on the death of captain Cook, and major Andre; a poem to the memory of lady Miller, and a few &s;tanzas to Mr. Wright, on taking her father's picture. The la&s;t always gave me the highe&s;t plea&s;ure. It required indeed no great effort, but is a mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;pecimen of filial af|fection, and of a rich, fervid, glowing imagina|tion. Her Loui&s;a, though her large&s;t, is not, in my idea, her <HI>happie&s;t</HI> performance. A novel is too much dignified by the charms of poetry. It is a courte&s;an, dre&s;&s;ed like a queen.</P>
<P>Whenever Mi&s;s Hannah More takes up her pen, &s;he never lo&s;es &s;ight of piety and virtue. Her Bleeding rock, Search after Happine&s;s, Sir Eldred of the Bower, Sacred Dramas, Female Fables, &amp;c. will plea&s;e and in&s;truct you. The little tract, lately publi&s;hed, intitled, "Thoughts on the Manners of the Great," which has had &s;o very exten&s;ive a circulation, is &s;aid to have come from her ingenious pen. The de&s;ign is excellent, and the execution di&s;plays a con&s;iderable knowledge of human life and manners. I wi&s;h it may leave &s;ome la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ions. But alas! the di&s;&s;ipated have few intervals for reflection.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="023176_0135_0FBDE1516991C110">
Mi&s;s Williams bids fair for a poetic laurel, that &s;hall long be green. Her Peru, is awork of con|&s;iderable merit.</P>
<P>The little &s;onnets of Mi&s;s Charlotte Smith are &s;oft, pen&s;ive, &s;entimental and pathetic, as a wo|man's productions &s;hould be. The mu&s;es, if I mi&s;t ake not, will, in time, rai&s;e her to a con&s;ider|able eminence. She has, <HI>as yet,</HI> &s;tepped forth only in little things, with a diffidence that is cha|racteri&s;tic of real genius in its <HI>fir&s;t</HI> attempts. Her next, public entre may be more in &s;tyle, and more con&s;equential.</P>
<P>The Comte&s;&s;e le Genlis I have before mention|ed, as a woman of a fine ta&s;te, and a cultivated un|der&s;tanding. Her <HI>Theatre &s;ur l'Education,</HI> as found|ed on a <HI>dramatic</HI> plan, may be recommended a|mong&s;t other poetical productions. There is not a &s;weeter ro&s;e in the garden of <HI>nature,</HI> than hers of Salency.</P>
<P>Lord Lyttleton was not, by any means, a capi|tal poet. There is, however, &s;uch a delicacy, &s;oftne&s;s, piety, and tender pathos in his &s;trains, as do the highe&s;t credit to his <HI>own</HI> heart, and mu&s;t improve that of every attentive reader. His mo|nody upon his Lucy has immortalized his &s;en&s;i|bility, his affection, and his virtue.</P>
<P>Aken&s;ide's work on the Plea&s;ures of Imagina|tion, needs no other recommendation, than what it has received from a generous and a di&s;cerning public. It is highly intere&s;ting; it required a very con&s;iderable effort, and his genius has ren|dered it beautifully picture&s;que.</P>
<P>Cowper's poems are calculated to do con&s;ider|able &s;ervice. He has made the mu&s;es hand-maids to religion. He has cho&s;en ver&s;es, only as a ve|hicle
<PB N="127" REF="023176_0136_0FBDE152E53498E0">for conveving in&s;tructions of &s;o important a nature, as would not, by any means, have di&s;ho|noured the pulpit. His &s;tyle is &s;imple, bold, man|ly, &s;pirited and energetic, his judgment, &s;trong and penetrating; his metaphors, forcible and hap|pily conceived; his ob&s;ervations on life and man|ners, accurate, and his &s;atire, ju&s;t and poignant.</P>
<P>He does not &s;eem &s;o much to have &s;tudied the production of a poem, with unity for its de&s;ign, and harmony in all its parts, as to &s;erve the cau&s;e of piety and virtue by general, de&s;ultory and im|pa&s;&s;ioned reflexions. His work on the whole, is a &s;trong &s;pecimen of genius and talents; rigid critici&s;m, perhaps, would &s;ay, that his piety wants a little mildne&s;s, and &s;eems to breathe the &s;pirit of a party.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t fini&s;hed poet of the age is Hayley. His E&s;&s;ay on Hi&s;tory and on Epic Poetry, his Ode to Howard, and his Triumphs of Temper have received very great and very general applau&s;e.</P>

<P>YOUR que&s;tion is a very proper one, and I will give you the be&s;t &s;atisfaction in my power.</P>
<P>Pronunciation or that part of grammar, called <HI>Orthoepy,</HI> as to any uncommon or difficult words, is governed by the quantity, which tho&s;e words have in the <HI>original</HI> language, from which they are derived. As you cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to under|&s;tand
<PB N="128" REF="023176_0137_0FBDE15464239258">the dead languages, you will of cour&s;e, fre|quently, be at a lo&s;s how to pronounce many words with propriety. The only method is recour&s;e to a dictionary, and the be&s;t in my opinion, are tho&s;e of Sheridan and John&s;on. Pronunciation, how|ever, is a very fluctuating thing; and though there certainly is a &s;tandard of propriety, over which mere fa&s;hion <HI>ought</HI> to have no power, yet I &s;hould always recommend a conformity to the manners of the polite&s;t people you may happen to conver&s;e with, rather than a pedantic affectation of gram|matical &s;trictne&s;s. The latter would be thought a <HI>conceited</HI> o&s;tentation of knowledge, which, in a young lady, would not be forgiven.</P>
<P>The allu&s;ions to Jupiter, Pallas, Venus, the Graces, the Mu&s;es, Helicon, Parna&s;&s;us, which have &s;o much puzzled you in the poets you have lately read, will be fully explained in Tooke's Pantheon, or Hi&s;tory of the Heathen Gods. The <HI>general</HI> fact is, that before the knowledge of the true God dawned on their minds, the&s;e poor, ig|norant heathens never dreamed of <HI>one</HI> omnipotent, all &s;ufficient, all pervading &s;pirit, which the &s;crip|tures have revealed, and de&s;cribed, as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all po&s;&s;ible perfections. They, therefore, formed to them&s;elves a <HI>multiplicity</HI> of gods, and attributed to one of them in particular, with a <HI>&s;pecific</HI> name, every great quality or &s;uperior excellence, that appeared beyond the ability of <HI>mortals.</HI> The&s;e deities they arranged into different cla&s;&s;es, accord|ing to their &s;uppo&s;ed degrees of pre-eminence; and fancied &s;ome of them to inhabit the heavens, and others, the woods, groves, rivers, &s;prings, mountains, &amp;c.</P>

You will be amu&s;ed with their fanciful opinions; and if you think aright, you will learn to ble&s;s the Almighty, on your knees, for having ca&s;t <HI>your</HI> lot in an age and country, where the go&s;pel has di&s;|per&s;ed the&s;e mi&s;ts and errors, dignified our views and nature beyond all expre&s;&s;ion, and given us the cleare&s;t knowledge of our duty.

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR LUCY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A LITTLE ta&s;te for the fine arts of painting, &s;culpture, architecture, will be of &s;ingular u&s;e. It will render every excur&s;ion you make, and every curio&s;ity you behold, exceedingly delightful, and enable you to become entertaining to all, with whom you conver&s;e.</P>
<P>A per&s;on thus accompli&s;hed, &s;urveys an elegant pile of building, the de&s;igns of a Palladio, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d-&s;cape of a Claude Lorrain, the portraits of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">i|tian, or the transfiguration of a Raphael <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> common rapture, and can entertain her&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>hours,</HI> with a ruin or a ca&s;tle, in which the un|&s;kilful
<PB N="130" REF="023176_0139_0FBDE1579D5137F0">can &s;ee nothing but deformity, or the cor|ro&s;ions of time.</P>
<P>Writers on Sculpture and Architecture are not numerous, and I am wading beyond my depth, when I attempt to recommend them. Winkle|man's reflexions on the &s;culpture of the Greeks, Evelyn's Parallel of ancient and modern Architec|ture, and Morris's Lectures may give you <HI>&s;ome</HI> ideas on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>On the art of <HI>painting,</HI> more has been written; yet without a natural genius for it, and &s;ome pre|vious in&s;tructions from a <HI>ma&s;ter,</HI> I do not know, whether you will be able to make any great pro|ficiency.</P>
<P>Webb's Inquiry into the Beauties of Painting is a very learned, elegant, ingenious work, and in|tere&s;ting, in an high degree, even to tho&s;e, who are, by no means, to be ranked among&s;t the <HI>cog|no&s;centi.</HI> The quotations from Homer, Virgil, Shake&s;peare, Milton, Boileau, Moliere, Racine, Ta&s;&s;o, Ario&s;to and Meta&s;ta&s;io are not only well contrived to <HI>illu&s;trate</HI> the &s;ubject, but to delight every per&s;on of reading and ta&s;te; whil&s;t the pic|tore&s;que imagery and &s;plendid language would &s;tamp a value on any production.</P>
<P>I remember to have been charmed, &s;ome years ago, with reading a &s;mall work, intided an <Q>E&s;&s;ay on Prints and Picture&s;que Beauty.</Q> I do not recollect, whether it bore the name of any author; but it &s;truck me as a very intere&s;ting and valuable performance. Genius and knowledge were won|derfully united, and embelli&s;hed the whole.</P>
<P>Fergu&s;on's Art of Drawing in Per&s;pective, I conceive to be u&s;eful, as an <HI>elementary</HI> work. An E&s;&s;ay on Land&s;cape may be con&s;idered in the &s;ame
<PB N="131" REF="023176_0140_0FBDE158E7D07D58">light; and you will be in&s;tructed and delighted, at the &s;ame time, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lay<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters"> two epi&s;tles to Romney, and Fre&s;noy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Art of Painting, tran&s;tated by Ma&s;on. This la&s;t mentioned author is &s;aid to excel in the three &s;i&s;ter arts of painting, poetry and mu&s;ic. In the two fir&s;t, he has given the <HI>world</HI> &s;pecimens of his &s;kill; with the latter he is &s;aid frequently to entertain the circle of his private friends.</P>
<P>But the be&s;t place for gratifying your curio&s;ity, and I &s;hould think, for improving your ta&s;te in paintings, is the annual exhibition of them, at Somer&s;et-hou&s;e. The metropolis, amid&s;t all its variety of invention, does not furni&s;h in my idea, a more elegant, or a more improving amu&s;ement. We &s;ee, with pride, &s;ome arti&s;ts of our own coun|try, v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing with the mo&s;t celebrated ma&s;ters of an|tiquity. Under the hands of a Reynolds, a Wright, a We&s;t, and many others, the Engli&s;h canva&s;s glows with inimitable beauty. A Raphael, a Ti|tian, a Dorreggio, a Rubens, a Pou&s;&s;in, or a Sal|vator Ro&s;a, &s;eem, in &s;ome degree, tran&s;planted to the Briti&s;h i&s;le.</P>
<P>A &s;tranger, indeed is, at fir&s;t &s;ight, &s;o much dazzled, with the &s;plendour and elegance of the company about him, that, in the charms of <HI>living</HI> beauty, he is tempted to overlook the efforts of the pencil. In no other place, that I ever &s;aw or re|collect, do art and nature &s;o powerfully combine to bewitch the &s;en&s;es, and captivate the imaginati|on.</P>
<P>If my time and place of re&s;idence were at my own command, I &s;hould frequently in the &s;ea&s;on, devote to this plea&s;ure, one of tho&s;e languid, after|noon hours, when the &s;pirits are exhau&s;ted with
<PB N="132" REF="023176_0141_0FBDE15A65780698">the employments of the morning, and want renew|ed vigour, ela&s;ticity and animation.</P>
<P>I am much intere&s;ted, believe me, in the reli&s;h I would give you for this &s;pecies of improvement.&mdash; I look forward, with a degree of plea&s;ure, to the time, when I may be the companion of your little tours, and delighted with your ob&s;ervations;&mdash; when we may hang in curio&s;ity, over fo&s;&s;ils and petrefactions; when we &s;hall pore over paintings, buildings, ruins with all the luxury of arti&s;ts and in &s;uch rational, innocent plea&s;ures endeavour to forget the &s;orrows, that will crowd on this <HI>varie|gated</HI> life.</P>

<P>IT is &s;o very agreeable to peru&s;e voyages and travels into <HI>foreign</HI> countries by way of coming ea|&s;ily at a knowledge of their hi&s;tory, cu&s;toms, cere|monies and degrees of civilization, that I do not wonder at the number and multiplicity of the&s;e productions. Authors wi&s;h to be <HI>read,</HI> and this is the &s;ort of work, which, if judiciou&s;ly executed, &s;uits every ta&s;te. It has a tendency to enlarge the mind, and dive&s;t it of illiberal prejudices. Books of this kind are now become &s;o numerous, that the difficulty only is how to make the &s;election.</P>
<P>I will begin with Moore, for he has plea&s;ed univer&s;ally. Your collection will be graced by his View of Society and Manners in France,
<PB N="133" REF="023176_0142_0FBDE15BE55EC5C0">Switzerland, and Germany, in two volumes, and his View of Society in Italy, in two more.</P>
<P>Wraxall is another writer in this way, who has &s;uperior merit. He has publi&s;hed a tour through the northern parts of Europe, and through France.</P>
<P>Pennant has been &s;ingularly happy in all his at|tempts. He intere&s;ts the antiquarian, the &s;cholar and the man of genius in his various productions. His works are numerous. A Tour through Scot|land, Voyages to the Hebrides, a Tour in North Wales; a Journey to Snowdon; and a Journey from Che&s;ter to London, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Switzerland is one of tho&s;e, <HI>romantic</HI> countries, that delights us in idea. Coxe has given &s;ketches of it, in a very plea&s;ing and picture&s;que manner.</P>
<P>Sherlock's Engli&s;h Traveller is a very original and entertaining book. The author is evidently a man of fanc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and genius, but rather ful&s;ome in his panegyries on particular characters, and excentric both in his &s;entiments and manner. He will, &s;ometimes, make you &s;mile with egoti&s;ms and the appearance of conceit; but he will likewi&s;e en|lighten your under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Cordiner's Antiquities and Scenery of the North of Scotland is an entertaining work. The plates annexed to it, plea&s;e the eye, and invigorate the imagination.</P>
<P>A tour to the lakes is become very fa&s;hionable, and is &s;aid abundantly to repay the travellers cu|rio&s;ity. We&s;t's de&s;cription of them may be u&s;eful, though the language appears too florid and poeti|cal.</P>
<P>The Tour to Ermenonville I have never &s;een; but it is mentioned as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing con&s;iderable merit. Gilpin's De&s;cription of the River Wye abounds
<PB N="134" REF="023176_0143_0FBDE15D66004198">with beautiful &s;cenery, and is a mo&s;t lively and entertaining production.</P>
<P>But the catalogue would be endle&s;s. A thou|&s;and, other books of this kind, are at hand, when|ever you are di&s;po&s;ed to travel with them in your clo&s;et.</P>
<P>If you have a little knowledge of Heraldry, it will be an <HI>embelli&s;hment;</HI> an agreeable exerci&s;e of your ta&s;te and ingenuity, and may, occa&s;ionally, &s;ugge&s;t a channel, through which you may &s;erve a valuable friend. The only books I recollect, are the Elements of it, by Porney; Gwillim, a large folio, and Edmond&s;on's Complete Body of it; in two volumes.</P>
<P>But after all this recommendation of different &s;tudies, do not mi&s;take me. I do not want to make you a fine writer, an hi&s;torian, a naturali&s;t, a geographer, an a&s;tronomer, a poet, a painter, a connoi&s;&s;eur, or a virtuo&s;o of any kind. But I would have you to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uch a <HI>general</HI> know|ledge, as will u&s;efully and innocently fill up your lei&s;ure hours, rai&s;e your ta&s;te above fanta&s;tic levi|ties, render you an agreeable friend and acquaint|ance, qualify you for the &s;olid duties of y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> &s;ta|tion, whatever they may be, and elevate, above all, your &s;oul to him, who is the &s;ource of <HI>all</HI> know|ledge, greatne&s;s and perfection.</P>

<P>To wield the needle with advantage, &s;o as to unite the u&s;eful and beautiful, is her <HI>particular</HI> pro|vince, and a &s;ort of ingenuity, which &s;hews her in the mo&s;t amiable and attracting point of view.&mdash; Solomon de&s;cribes his excellent daughter, as em|ployed in the labours of the di&s;taff or the needle. Homer paints his lovely matrons as engaged in &s;uch dome&s;tic avocations. Andromache is thus relieving her &s;olitude, when &s;he is &s;urpri&s;ed into tran&s;port by the unexpected return of Hector from the war.</P>
<P>The heart glows with plea&s;ure, when we read the accounts of the good Roman matrons in the purer and unvitiated ages of their republic. The greate&s;t men, princes, warriors, &s;enators and phi|lo&s;ophers were clothed in the labours of their wives and daughters. Indu&s;try in this happy pe|riod, was e&s;teemed a virtue, and it was not beneath a woman of the fir&s;t quality or under&s;tanding to be an excellent economi&s;t, who <Q>looked well to the ways of her hou&s;ehold.</Q></P>
<P>Employment is the grand pre&s;ervative of health and innocence. When we have nothing to do, we immediately become a <HI>burden</HI> to our&s;elves; the mind and body langui&s;h for want of exerci&s;e, and we fall into a thou&s;and dangerous temptations.</P>

Many &s;ongs are couched in &s;uch <HI>indelicate</HI> language, and convey &s;uch a train of <HI>lu&s;cious</HI> ideas, as are only calculated to &s;oil the purity of a <HI>youthful</HI> mind. I &s;hould therefore recommend, (if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf,) rather the <HI>&s;acred,</HI> than the <HI>profane,</HI> of this &s;tudy.&mdash; Indeed church mu&s;ic is, in it&s;elf, more delightful than any other. What can be &s;uperror to &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of Judas Maccabaeus, or the Me&s;&s;iah?&mdash; There is not, perhaps, an higher among&s;t the <HI>me|lancholy</HI> plea&s;ures than a funeral dirge.</P>
<P>Dancing, in a degree, is profe&s;&s;edly an e&s;&s;ential part of a good education, as correcting any <HI>awk|wardne&s;s</HI> of ge&s;ture, giving an ea&s;y and <HI>graceful</HI> motion to the body, and if practi&s;ed <HI>early,</HI> perhaps even in <HI>directing</HI> its growth. Modern manners, however, have carried the fondne&s;s for this accom|pli&s;hment to an <HI>immoderate</HI> extreme. A pa&s;&s;ion for making the be&s;t figure in a minuet, is va&s;tly beneath the dignity of a woman's under&s;tanding. And I am not &s;ure, whether <HI>excelling</HI> in this par|ticular does not in&s;pire too great a fondne&s;s for di&s;&s;ipating plea&s;ures, and proportionably abate the ardour for more retired virtues. A woman, who can &s;parkle and engage the admiration of ev|ery beholder, at a birth night or a ball, is not a|ways content with the graver office of managing a family, or the &s;till and &s;ober innocence of do|me&s;tic &s;cenes. Be&s;ides dancing is not, at <HI>certain</HI> moments, without its temptations. An elegant, illuminated room, brilliant company, the enchant|ing powers of mu&s;ic, admiring eyes, ob&s;equious
<PB N="138" REF="023176_0147_0FBDE16366277C90">beaus, attitude, &amp;c. are apt to tran&s;port the mind a little beyond the rational medium of <HI>gentle</HI> agi|tation.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR LUCY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WILL you bear with my impertinence, if I attempt to give you my directions on a &s;ubject where your &s;ex are allowed to po&s;&s;e&s;s infinitely more ta&s;te and judgment than our own&mdash;that of dre&s;s. I offer however, my plain and undi&s;gui&s;ed &s;entiments, only for your advantage; and I am
<PB N="139" REF="023176_0148_0FBDE164F8DEAB88">&s;ure you will receive them with that candour and indulgence, to which my friend&s;hip for you has an indi&s;putable claim.</P>
<P><HI>Neatne&s;s,</HI> you cannot cultivate with too much attention. I would pre&s;s it on every female, as &s;trongly, if po&s;&s;ible, as Lord Che&s;terfield did the <HI>graces</HI> on his &s;on. The want of it is unpardonable in a <HI>man,</HI> but in a <HI>woman,</HI> it is <HI>&s;hocking.</HI> It di&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ts all her friends and intimates; has e&s;tranged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> affections of many an hu&s;band, and made him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that &s;atisfaction abroad, which he found not at home.</P>
<P>Some ladies, who were remarkably attentive to their per&s;ons <HI>before</HI> marriage, neglect them <HI>after|wards,</HI> in an egregious manner. They cannot pay a wor&s;e compliment to their own delicacy, or to their hu&s;bands. If they conceived &s;ome efforts nece&s;&s;ary to <HI>gain</HI> the prize, more, I am &s;ure, are required to pre&s;erve it.</P>
<P>It is the opinion of (I believe,) Rochefoucault, that nice ob&s;erver of life and manners, that the affection of woman <HI>increa&s;es</HI> after marriage, whil&s;t that of man is apt to <HI>decline.</HI> Whatever be the <HI>cau&s;e,</HI> a prudent woman will, at lea&s;t, u&s;e every method in her power, to guard again&s;t &s;o <HI>mortify|ing</HI> a charge. Neatne&s;s, however, is <HI>ea&s;ily</HI> practi|&s;ed, and will always have con&s;iderable weight.</P>
<P>In the eyes of <HI>&s;ervants</HI> and dome&s;tics, indeed, a woman lo&s;es her con&s;equence and authority by a neglect of her per&s;on. She will not be obeyed with <HI>cheerfulne&s;s,</HI> and &s;he will become an object of <HI>ridicule,</HI> in all their private parties and conver&s;a|tions. If inferiors mu&s;t be &s;ubject, they will pay an <HI>uncon&s;trained</HI> homage only to a per&s;on, who at|tracts by <HI>propriety,</HI> the e&s;timation of the world.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="023176_0149_0FBDE166662B2610">
Neatne&s;s is the <HI>natural</HI> garb of a well ordered mind, and has a near alliance with <HI>purity</HI> of heart. Law has &s;aid of his Miranda, that &s;he was always clean <HI>without,</HI> becau&s;e &s;he was always pure <HI>within.</HI> And Richard&s;on, who&s;e ta&s;te was as exqui&s;ite, as his imagination glowing, has painted his Clari&s;&s;a, as always dre&s;&s;ed, before &s;he came down &s;tairs, for any company, that might break in upon her during the whole day.</P>
<P><HI>Finery</HI> is &s;eldom graceful. The ea&s;y undre&s;s of a morning often plea&s;es more, than the mo&s;t ela|borate and co&s;tly ornaments. I need not &s;ay of how much time and money they rob us, which are &s;acred to virtue and to the poor, nor how &s;oon this very <HI>embelli&s;hed</HI> body will be du&s;t and a&s;hes. The perfection of the art is conveyed in <HI>two</HI> words; an <HI>elegant &s;implicity.</HI> Ladies are certainly injudi|cious in employing &s;o many <HI>male</HI> fri&s;eurs about their per&s;ons. The cu&s;tom is indelicate; it is contrary to <HI>cleanine&s;s,</HI> and all their manoeuvres cannot equal the beauty of natural, ea&s;y ringlets, untortured and unadorned.</P>
<P>The nearer you approach to the <HI>ma&s;culine</HI> in your apparel, the further you will recede from the <HI>ap|propriate</HI> graces and <HI>&s;oftne&s;s</HI> of your &s;ex. Addi&s;on, in his day, la&s;hed, with a delicate vein of <HI>irony,</HI> this ab&s;urd <HI>transformation.</HI> The pre&s;ent age wants &s;uch an inimitabl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> cen&s;or. The riding habits, particularly, that have been &s;o fa&s;hionable, and even made their appearance at all public places, conceal every thing that is attractive in a woman's per&s;on, her figure, her manner, and her graces. They wholly <HI>un&s;ex</HI> her, and give her the unplea&s;ing air of an Amazon, or a virago. Who likes the idea? or if you would be more &s;truck with the <HI>ab&s;urdity,</HI> tell
<PB N="141" REF="023176_0150_0FBDE167E5CA4160">me what you would think of <HI>petite maitres</HI> in muffs? You immediately de&s;pi&s;e the ridiculou&s;|ne&s;s of the one; we daily <HI>feel</HI> the <HI>unnaturalne&s;s</HI> of the other. We forget that you are <HI>women</HI> in <HI>&s;uch a garb,</HI> and we forget to love.</P>
<P>Every public paper one opens, is a violation of your delicacy and an in&s;ult to your under&s;tanding. Powders, perfumes, pomatums, co&s;metics, e&s;&s;ence of ro&s;es, Olimpian dew, artificial eyes, teeth, hair adverti&s;ed for your advantage, would be an heavy &s;tigma, if &s;ome kind and <HI>well di&s;po&s;ed</HI> per|&s;ons among&s;t <HI>our own &s;ex,</HI> were not willing to &s;hare with you a part of the burden. Blu&s;h, my dear girl, at &s;uch un&s;eemly practices. Be content to be what God, and nature <HI>intended</HI> you: appear in your true colours; abhor any thing, like <HI>deceit</HI> in your <HI>appearance,</HI> as well as your character.&mdash; What mu&s;t all &s;en&s;ible men think of a woman, who has a room, filled with a thou&s;and preparations and mixtures to <HI>deceive</HI> him? What money, what time mu&s;t be given to this <HI>odious,</HI> in&s;ufferable vani|ty! Under &s;uch <HI>unnatural</HI> management; how different mu&s;t be the female of the <HI>evening</HI> and the <HI>morning!</HI> What mu&s;t we think of marriage; dre&s;&s;|ing rooms and toilets! What an opening for ex|po&s;tulation, coldne&s;&s;es, aver&s;ions! If an <Q>ele|gant &s;implicity</Q> be the <HI>perfection</HI> of dre&s;s, this is &s;urely, as far as po&s;&s;ible, removed from perfec|tion. It is not <HI>&s;implicity;</HI> it is not <HI>elegant.</HI></P>
<P>It would be cruel to add any thing to the puni&s;h|ment of the <HI>men,</HI> who can have recour&s;e to &s;uch <HI>effeminate</HI> artifices. They have <HI>already</HI> the &s;corn and ridicule of one &s;ex, and the &s;tern contempt and indignation of the other. They are poor, amphi|bious

<P><HI>Painting</HI> is indecent, offen&s;ive, <HI>criminal.</HI> It ha&s;tens the approach of wrinkles; it de&s;troys con|&s;titutions, and defaces the image of your maker.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER 1. TO MISS LUCY &mdash;</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR LUCY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A WOMAN may be fairly allowed a little more attention to <HI>ornament,</HI> than would be pardon|able in the other &s;ex. Nature, through all her works has lavi&s;hed more <HI>external</HI> brilliancy, co|louring and plumage on the <HI>female.</HI> And though dre&s;s, in it&s;elf, is no <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> quality, we are indu|ced to judge more of your <HI>real</HI> character and di&s;|po&s;ition from it, than you are apt to imagine. We fancy it, in its different <HI>modifications,</HI> a mark of good &s;en&s;e, delicacy and di&s;cretion, or of the very oppo&s;ite defects. Every &s;en&s;ible wo|man, therefore, will &s;tudy it &s;o far, as not to &s;ubject her&s;elf to unfavorable con&s;tructions. She will endeavour to convince every beholder, that &s;he knows the proper <HI>medium</HI> betwixt a ridiculous
<PB N="4" REF="023176_0155_0FBDDF4BE7FB4678"><HI>profu&s;ion,</HI> and a total <HI>want,</HI> of ornament; that &s;he can ti&s;&s;ue plainne&s;s with elegance; that &s;he does not wi&s;h to <HI>&s;educe</HI> by her appearance, but only to <HI>plea&s;e;</HI> that &s;he has cultivated her mind, much more than her per&s;on, and placed the highe&s;t value, not on the <HI>outward,</HI> peri&s;hable <HI>ca&s;ket,</HI> but the diamond <HI>within.</HI></P>
<P>I rejoice that the good &s;en&s;e of my country|women has corrected &s;ome late <HI>glaring</HI> indecencies of dre&s;s. Young ladies &s;hould not be <HI>too liberal</HI> in the <HI>di&s;play</HI> of their charms, Too much <HI>expo&s;ure</HI> does not enhance their value. And it approaches, too nearly, to the manner of <HI>tho&s;e</HI> women, whom they would &s;urely think it no honour to re&s;emble. Bo&s;oms &s;hould throb <HI>un&s;een.</HI> The bouffant was an ornament of too <HI>tran&s;parent</HI> a kind. Wherever delicacy throws its mode&s;t drapery, <HI>imagination</HI> always lends inexpre&s;&s;ible charms. As fine a wo|man, as the Venus of Medici, would cea&s;e to be admired, if curio&s;ity cea&s;ed to be <HI>&s;u&s;pended.</HI></P>
<P>There is a great <HI>neatne&s;s</HI> in the dre&s;s of quakers, and of &s;ome other &s;ectaries, who have copied their example. It has, however, more <HI>primne&s;s,</HI> than ea&s;e. In this re&s;pect, you have too much good &s;en&s;e to affect <HI>&s;ingularity.</HI> Religion con&s;i&s;ts in &s;omething more <HI>&s;ub&s;tantial,</HI> than any <HI>particular</HI> modes of appearance. And there is, if I mi&s;take not, &s;ome <HI>conceit</HI> and <HI>pride,</HI> under this prodigious, <HI>ever-acted</HI> plainne&s;s. Many, whom the&s;e narrow minded per&s;ons would &s;entence, perhaps to tor|ments, for being elegantly dre&s;&s;ed, have hearts that overflow with univer&s;al benevolence and in|finitely more piety and goodne&s;s, than them&s;elves.</P>
<P>You know what young lady I mean by <HI>Emelia.</HI> I do not know a per&s;on, that dre&s;&s;es better. She
<PB N="5" REF="023176_0156_0FBDDF4D66569EF8">is &s;ingularly happy in her choice of <HI>colours.</HI> Like her virtues they are of the &s;oft and <HI>&s;haded</HI> kind, not the brilliant or the gaudy. I never &s;aw her &s;ine; but &s;he never is <HI>fanta&s;tic.</HI> She is &s;eldom &s;plendid; but <HI>neatne&s;s</HI> is all her own. If &s;he puts on only a ribbon, it is &s;elected with all the exqui&s;ite mode&s;ty of her mind, and di&s;po&s;ed of by the hands of ta&s;te. The graces always appear to have been in waiting for the few moments, that &s;he ever &s;uffers dre&s;s to take up her attention.</P>
<P>I very much admire the &s;a&s;hes, which, of late, have been &s;o fa&s;hionable among&s;t young ladies.&mdash; They give me the idea of a childi&s;h &s;implicity, in|nocence and ea&s;e. The&s;e, and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">owing ringlets</HI> are on the &s;y&s;tem of <HI>nature.</HI> And nature will always plea&s;e.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry, however, to ob&s;erve that the&s;e <HI>girl|i&s;h</HI> ornaments &s;hould likewi&s;e have encircled the le&s;s delicate wai&s;ts of &s;ome married women.&mdash; There cannot be a more ab&s;urd or di&s;gu&s;ting affec|tation. If I was not writing to ladies, I would be <HI>humourous.</HI> Or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ch a &s;ubject, I could be <HI>&s;evere.</HI> But &s;ome improp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> as might be &s;ugge&s;ted, and I will only &s;ay, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ober, <HI>aged</HI> autumn, is nev|er clad in the cheerful Every of &s;pring.</P>
<P>On the whole, my dear girl, as a rea&s;onable creature, and as a chri&s;tian, never &s;uffer your&s;elf to be led away by an <HI>extravagant</HI> fondne&s;s for dre&s;s. What is finery, compared with under|&s;tanding? What is finery, compared with under|&s;tanding? What is &s;plendor contra&s;ted with rea|&s;on? What is your body, but a <HI>temporary</HI> recepta|cle for an <HI>immortal</HI> mind? It is but the <HI>ca&s;ket;</HI> the <HI>jewel</HI> is the &s;oul. And how very low and poor in it&s;elf is the ambition of apparel? After all our efforts, we can never make it equal the beauty of lillies, or to vie with the exqui&s;ite tints
<PB N="6" REF="023176_0157_0FBDDF4EE737DF08">of the ro&s;e. Whatever you can &s;pare, from &s;uch expence, to give to the poor, will be a <HI>&s;olid</HI> trea|&s;ure, when beauty is but du&s;t and a&s;hes, and when gaiety is forgotten.</P>

<P>POLITENESS, if &s;uppo&s;ed, like Lord Che&s;|terfield's, to be made up of <HI>di&s;&s;imulation,</HI> or to con&s;i&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n a number of ceremonious attitudes or f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ome compliments, without any meaning, is ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">culou&s;ly frivolous: but on the other hand, if it &s;prings from principle, from a real de&s;ire of plea&s;ing, and is directed to its proper ends, it is, at lea&s;t, a mo&s;t amiable quality, if it does not rank in the number of the virtues. In the inter|cour&s;e of life and the pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ociety, this good breeding is nece&s;&s;ary to our own peace, and to that of other. It prevents a thou&s;and inquie|tudes, irritations, offences; it diffu&s;es an innocent plea&s;ure, and it diffu&s;es it <HI>every moment.</HI> We daily conve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e with many per&s;ons, con&s;iderably <HI>indifferent</HI> to us, and from whom we expect nei|ther &s;ervices nor obligations, who, yet, have it in their power, by a rough, ungracious manner, by unguarded &s;ayings, or &s;peaking (as it is called) <HI>their minds,</HI> e&s;&s;entially to hurt our feelings, &s;our our &s;pirits, give us a bad <HI>head ach,</HI> or to break our re&s;t; there are as many, on the other hand, who look up to <HI>us</HI> for no <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> favours, whom,
<PB N="7" REF="023176_0158_0FBDDF50678D61A8">yet, in <HI>our</HI> turn, we may, not a little, irritate and di&s;tre&s;s, by a want of civility, by any <HI>hauteur</HI> or &s;uperciliou&s;ne&s;s in our looks or carriage, or a with|holding of tho&s;e kind attentions, which, on every principle of rea&s;on, humanity and civilization are reciprocally due from every human creature to another.</P>
<P>This rea&s;oning, &s;till more forcibly, applies to members of the <HI>&s;ame</HI> family; to wives and hu&s;|bands; children and parents; brothers and &s;i&s;ters. If this kind of good breeding be ever violated among&s;t <HI>them,</HI> the con&s;equence is coldne&s;s, quar|rels, and gradual <HI>aver&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>So great, indeed, is the influence of true polite|ne&s;s over the mind, that even favours conferred in an <HI>unplea&s;ing</HI> manner, <HI>without</HI> it, becomes an in&s;upportable in&s;ult; whil&s;t a refu&s;al, <HI>&s;oftens</HI> by it, into an obligation, and is, &s;ometimes, made the ba&s;is of a la&s;ting gratitude, affection or e&s;teem.</P>
<P>This grace may be defined the art of being ea&s;y our&s;elves, in company, and of making all others ea&s;y about us. It is the proper medium betwixt the total want of, and an officious, over-acted, civility. It con&s;i&s;ts in a general, <HI>indi&s;criminate</HI> at|tention; in doing little civil offices, and &s;aying o|bliging things to all the parties we conver&s;e with in accommodating our&s;elves, as well as the conver|&s;ation to their particular ta&s;tes, habits and inclina|tions; in keeping every offen&s;ive &s;ubject and idea out of view; in never glancing at <HI>our own</HI> affairs, and always paying the minute&s;t regard to tho&s;e of others, in <HI>annihilating,</HI> as it were, our&s;elves, and as &s;tudiou&s;ly exalting all that are about us.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="023176_0159_0FBDDF51E6C25530">
If I have not much mi&s;taken, the be&s;t rules for it will be found in that religion, which requires us <Q>to love one another; to be gentle and courteous; to avoid offences; to become <HI>innocently</HI> all things to all men; in honour to prefer one another, and to e&s;teem others better than our|&s;elves.</Q></P>

<P>IT is a great unhappine&s;s to <HI>many</HI> ladies of <HI>for|tune,</HI> that they have not &s;ufficient employment to fill up their time; and in order to prevent that, langour and <HI>ennu&igrave;,</HI> which are the mo&s;t unplea&s;ant feelings of human life, either fall into a low &s;tate of &s;pirits, or have recour&s;e to play, public plea|&s;ures, or a <HI>perpetual</HI> round of <HI>vi&s;its,</HI> for their amu&s;e|ment.</P>
<P>The religious exerci&s;es, however, and the &s;tu|dies, I have recommended, will not only occupy <HI>your</HI> hours in a rational and u&s;eful manner, but <HI>&s;ome</HI> of them, from their very nature, will become an inexhau&s;tible &s;ource of the pure&s;t plea&s;ure.&mdash; Still <HI>uniformity</HI> in any one pur&s;uit, however plea&s;ing, will exhau&s;t the &s;pirits, and they will frequently want a rolle&s;.

Innocent relaxation is as much a part of true wi&s;dom, as employment it&s;elf. Indeed it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to fit us for our duties. The earth it&s;elf would not be able to vegetate and &s;hoot forth in|to all the bloom and verdure of &s;pring, if it did not regain its exhau&s;ted powers during the &s;om|brous lei&s;ure of the winter.</P>
<P>The rule is, we &s;hould amu&s;e our&s;elves, in order to <HI>live,</HI> in the true &s;en&s;e of the word, and not live to be <HI>amu&s;ed.</HI> Relaxation, conducted on <HI>this</HI> principle, will never occupy too great a &s;hare of our time or attention. It will be con&s;i&s;tent with the univer&s;al principle of "doing all things to the glory of God."</P>
<P>A woman's amu&s;ements &s;hould, as much as po&s;|&s;ible, be <HI>dome&s;tic;</HI> and her own walls will pre&s;ent many excellent opportunities of &s;uch a nature. The exerci&s;e of parental or filial affection is a &s;ource of <HI>heart-felt</HI> and refined plea&s;ure. Inter|cour&s;es of tenderne&s;s betwixt branches of the &s;ame family, and the little engaging attentions they create, &s;timulate the finer movements of the body, and give play to all the refre&s;hing emotions. A <HI>mother,</HI> in particular, mu&s;t have the&s;e <HI>natural</HI> de|lights in <HI>perfection.</HI> Her heart mu&s;t vibrate, with an exqui&s;ite &s;ondne&s;s, to the playful graces of a little offspring, and their continually unfolding charms.</P>
<P>Exerci&s;e in the open air, is another great amu&s;e|ment. Fre&s;h breezes, variety of objects, gentle motion, and all the charming pictures of nature cheer the mind, and invigorate the &s;pirits. The &s;edentary life of women is the parent of many fa&s;hionable complaints; weak nerves, low &s;pirits, vapours, hy&s;terics, languors. <HI>No</HI> con&s;titution can
<PB N="11" REF="023176_0162_0FBDDF566843F008">long with&s;tand the bad effects of luxury and in|action. Such people may <HI>exi&s;t</HI> but they cannot <HI>live.</HI></P>
<P>In a rich entertainment, Mr. Addi&s;on &s;aw fe|vers, drop&s;ies, gouts and rheumati&s;ms in embryo. Who, that looks at women, emaciated with <HI>mid|night</HI> plea&s;ures, and pale for want of exerci&s;e and air, mu&s;t not behold the &s;eeds of infinite di&s;orders, and likewi&s;e tremble for the ri&s;ing generation?</P>
<P>The ancients paid a very nice attention to the con&s;titution of females. To give them, in <HI>particu|lar &s;ituations,</HI> every degree of firmne&s;s, was not thought beneath the attention of tho&s;e great men, who by their eloquence and valour, a&s;toni&s;hed the world.</P>
<P>Attention to a <HI>garden</HI> is truly <HI>feminine</HI> amu&s;e|ment. If you mix it with a ta&s;te for botany and a knowledge of plants and flowers, you will never be in want of an excellent re&s;torative. Our fir&s;t parents are de&s;cribed by Milton, as tending the &s;hrubs and flowers of their paradi&s;e, with uncea&s;|ing a&s;&s;iduity, and as ri&s;ing with the dawn to work:</P>
<LG>
<L>Among&s;t &s;weet dews and flow'rs, where any row</L>
<L>Of fruit trees over woody, reach'd too far</L>
<L>Their pamper'd boughs, and needed hands to check</L>
<L>Fruitle&s;s embraces, or they lead the vine</L>
<L>To wed her elm.&mdash;</L>
</LG>
<P>There is an inexpre&s;&s;ible <HI>tranquility</HI> in a garden, which &s;ooths the &s;pirits into that kind of cheerful pen&s;ivene&s;s, which is, perhaps, the right tempera|ture of the moral con&s;titution. Our Saviour often re&s;orted to a garden. Innocence and piety found it the happie&s;t place for meditation and repo&s;e. It is impo&s;&s;ible, indeed, to have a richer ble&s;&s;ing,
<PB N="12" REF="023176_0163_0FBDDF57E73DBEF0">than a ta&s;te for the <HI>general</HI> beauties of nature. It is an inexhau&s;tible fund of plea&s;ure within <HI>every</HI> per&s;on's reach; it purifies and re&s;ines the mind, and rai&s;es it above the <HI>artificial</HI> gaieties, which are purcha&s;ed at &s;o great an expence of time, money, and often, of <HI>con&s;titution.</HI></P>
<LG>
<L>O ble&s;'d of heav'n, whom not the languid &s;ongs</L>
<L>Of luxury, the &s;iren, not the bribes</L>
<L>Of &s;ordid wealth, nor all the gaudy &s;ports</L>
<L>Of pageant honours can &s;educe to leave</L>
<L>The&s;e ever blooming &s;weets, which from the &s;tore</L>

<L>Thus the men</L>

<P>But <HI>friend&s;hip,</HI> after all, is the great <HI>medicine</HI> of life.

<P>Great care, indeed, judgment, ta&s;te and vigi|lance are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to direct you in the choice.

<P>PUBLIC plea&s;ures are e&s;teemed and called the amu&s;ements of women. But I think them far from an&s;wering the name. In fact they <HI>agitate,</HI> rather than <HI>relieve,</HI> and are more frequently &s;ources of vexation, than repo&s;e. Superior rivals eclip&s;e; fancied friends are inattentive, and the gaiety of the &s;cene has no connection with quiet of the heart.

<P>IT would be uncomfortable to <HI>your&s;elf</HI> to live wholly <HI>alone</HI> in the mid&s;t of &s;ociety; and to <HI>others,</HI> it would carry the appearance of great pride, or conceit, or &s;ingularity.

Nay, even the lighte&s;t and mo&s;t in&s;ignifi|cant conver&s;ation has a tendency to relieve inten&s;e thoughtfulne&s;s, and keep the mind from preying too much upon it&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Tea parties</HI> are the <HI>general</HI> mode of &s;ociety, among&s;t ladies.

<P>I HAVE indeed, as you &s;ay, frequently dwelt with plea&s;ure on Mi&s;s Lou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;a &mdash;, and do
<PB N="23" REF="023176_0174_0FBDDF686514DFC8">think her a charming woman. She always &s;truck me as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, in a &s;uperior degree, tho&s;e quali|ties, which con&s;titute the <HI>graceful and attractive,</HI> and therefore as a very proper pattern to all young people. Not that I think a &s;ervile imitation of <HI>any</HI> original, however excellent, would render <HI>another</HI> plea&s;ing. Nature no more intended any two per&s;ons to have preci&s;ely the &s;ame <HI>manner,</HI> than the &s;ame eyes, or features, or complexion. But &s;till a <HI>familiar</HI> intimacy with &s;uch a woman mu&s;t <HI>in&s;en&s;ibly</HI> communicate &s;ome traits of re&s;em|blance, which by incorporating with the <HI>general</HI> ma&s;s of a character, will form a beautiful and con|&s;i&s;tent whole.</P>
<P>Though I have always admired her only in the <HI>gro&s;s,</HI> and was charmed, without con&s;idering the con&s;tituent principles of her excellence, I will, as you reque&s;t it, endeavour to <HI>analyze</HI> and trace them to their &s;ource.</P>
<P>He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> per&s;on is rather <HI>genteel,</HI> than beautiful, &s;o that &s;he is more indebted to her&s;elf, than to nature, for her attractions. And a wonderful energy in|deed they have. For I have often &s;een this girl &s;teal the notice of the whole company from others of her &s;ex, who were infinitely more di&s;tingui&s;hed by the beauty of their per&s;ons, as well as the ad|vantage of birth and fortune.</P>
<P>The <HI>ground work</HI> of all her charms, is, (what I cannot call by a better name, than that of) &s;implici|ty; an artle&s;s, unde&s;igning, <HI>un&s;tudied</HI> manner, flowing from an innocent and virtuous heart, which, ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">r &s;eeks <HI>concealment,</HI> as having indeed <HI>nothing</HI> to conceal. Loui&s;a never affects to be any thing, but what &s;he <HI>is.</HI> She does not <HI>exalt</HI> her&s;elf
<PB N="24" REF="023176_0175_0FBDDF69E512E7E0">above mea&s;ure, nor ever ridiculou&s;ly degrades her&s;elf, in order to be <HI>exalted.</HI> Her ge&s;tures, atti|tude, voice, pronunciation are all under the im|mediate impre&s;&s;ion and guidance of <HI>nature.</HI> Loui&s;a <HI>expre&s;&s;es</HI> an innocent plea&s;ure, becau&s;e &s;he <HI>feels</HI> it in the company of &s;en&s;ible and agreeable men, and yet never &s;eeks it with an improper avidity. She never harangues upon, or vaunts a <HI>&s;uperior</HI> &s;en&s;i|bility, but frequently di&s;plays no <HI>incon&s;iderable</HI> &s;hare of it, by <HI>involuntary</HI> emotions. She never, in any re&s;pect, affects connections, appearance or any thing <HI>above</HI> her fortune, nor endeavours to &s;hine at the expence of others.</P>
<P>This, though very imperfectly de&s;cribed, is, ac|cording to my idea, the fir&s;t excellence in the character of this lady. It is the very rever&s;e of that ab&s;urd affectation, which, by a&s;&s;uming a thou&s;and, <HI>fanciful</HI> &s;hapes, renders graces unlovely, and even beauty di&s;gu&s;ting. Loui&s;a charms every per&s;on, becau&s;e &s;he is <HI>always</HI> amiable and oblig|ing, without <HI>&s;tudying</HI> to charm. Her face is al|ways welcome in company, though &s;he throws no <HI>artificial</HI> lightning into her eyes, &s;oftne&s;s into her features, nor <HI>li&s;ping</HI> into her articulation.</P>
<P>The common <HI>&s;y&s;tematic</HI> education of girls is un|favourable to this &s;implicity. The tendency of <HI>modern</HI> culture is to rai&s;e art, upon the ruins of nature. Such a method would not &s;ucceed in any thing <HI>el&s;e,</HI> and how &s;hould it in the treatment of women? If there be one object in the world, more di&s;gu&s;ting than all others, it is a girl, whom nature formed to be innocent and artle&s;s, reducing affecta|tion and di&s;gui&s;e to a <HI>&s;y&s;tem.</HI></P>
<P>It is with &s;implicity of manner, as it is with ea&s;e of &s;tyle, in a writer. When we read his
<PB N="25" REF="023176_0176_0FBDDF6B65EE1158">works, it appears the mo&s;t <HI>ea&s;y</HI> attainment imagi|nable; but, in fact, nothing is &s;o <HI>uncommon,</HI> either in conduct or in writings. And the rea&s;on mu&s;t be, that, in&s;tead of attending to the guidance of nature, people make an extraordinary effort to be &s;omething <HI>great,</HI> or <HI>&s;uperior,</HI> and uncommon. Sim|plicity may be &s;tyled the ea&s;y and the graceful <HI>negligence</HI> of conduct, yet, as in dre&s;s, it charms more than the mo&s;t elaborate ornaments.</P>
<P>Through all the wonderful works of God there is a maje&s;tic &s;implicity. Nature knows no <HI>affec|tation.</HI> Her pro&s;pects, hills, vallies, alcoves, grot|tos are all un&s;tudied; her magnificence is wild and artle&s;s. There is a &s;implicity of de&s;ign and effect in all her wonders, in the con&s;truction and revolu|tion of planets, in the flow and ebbing of the tides, and in the vomiting of immen&s;e volcanos. The carnation never aims at the &s;tately magnificence of the o&s;tentatious hoary oak. Every ro&s;e is con|tent with its own natural hues and odours; and affects not the elegant &s;weetne&s;s of the Re&s;eda, (minionette.)</P>
<P><HI>Nature</HI> is the &s;tandard of <HI>perfection.</HI> Every character and every art is only &s;o far fini&s;hed, as it approaches to her likene&s;s. No paintings are beautiful without this ground-work of <HI>&s;implicity.</HI> It charms in a Correggio. It was the excellence of a Raphael. It lives in the exqui&s;ite touches of a Reynolds.</P>
<P>The beauty of all <HI>writing</HI> is founded in &s;impli|city. It was with Homer, Virgil and Milton, when they &s;ketched out their inimitable poems. Of Shake&s;peare it was the very &s;oul. Statuaries, &s;culptors, architects have only gained an exten&s;ive
<PB N="26" REF="023176_0177_0FBDDF6CE556EA08">reputation, in proportion as they have &s;tudied this <HI>divine</HI> &s;implicity.</P>
<P>No woman can be graceful without it. It will go further, in the art of plea&s;ing, without <HI>any</HI> ac|compli&s;hments, than <HI>all</HI> the accompli&s;hments will go, without it.</P>

<P>ANOTHER &s;triking quality in Loui&s;a, is her con&s;tant <HI>cheerfulne&s;s.</HI> Though few women in the world are more &s;erious or thoughtful, where any <HI>&s;olid</HI> duties are concerned, where the health, peace, comfort, convenience of her friends and parents, or any <HI>dome&s;tic</HI> attentions are at &s;take, and though &s;he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch an exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility, as is apt to produce an unevenne&s;s of &s;pirits, yet, whenever I &s;ee this lovely girl, &s;he always beguiles me into a <HI>temporary</HI> cheerfulne&s;s, by the force of her own. This gaiety of heart, equally removed from a thoughtle&s;s levity or a moping gloom, is a mo&s;t de&s;irable quality in women. <HI>Men</HI> are per|plexed with various anxieties of bu&s;ine&s;s and am|bition, and are naturally more thoughtful, pro|found, and melancholy; women certainly were formed to <HI>&s;ooth and to enliven.</HI> It is one of the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings we derive from their &s;ociety, and from the mo&s;t &s;acred of all connections.</P>
<P>Cheerfulne&s;s (&s;aith the wi&s;e man) doeth good, like a medicine. It has a wonderful effect on all
<PB N="27" REF="023176_0178_0FBDDF6E67312460">the finer organs of the body. If it was not for lit|tle innocent &s;allies of this kind, it would be im|po&s;&s;ible to bear &s;evere application. The year would be in&s;upportable, if it was wholly compo&s;ed of the dark and gloomy days of November.</P>
<P>There are many <HI>unavoidable</HI> ills, &s;ickne&s;&s;es and misfortunes in human life, which will come <HI>uncall|ed</HI> to deject our &s;pirits, and poi&s;on our repo&s;e; but we &s;hould not <HI>anticipate</HI> them by gloomy apprehen|&s;ions, nor ever &s;uffer an <HI>unnece&s;&s;ary</HI> melancholy to &s;it upon our looks. It is the true&s;t policy to be <HI>innocently</HI> gay and cheerful, whil&s;t we <HI>can.</HI> It for|bids the approach of wrinkles, and adds many years to the little fleeting &s;pan of human life. Some pieti&s;ts have encouraged gloom by their er|roneous notions of the Deity, and of chri&s;tian &s;elf-denial. But I &s;hould &s;trongly &s;u&s;pect their good|ne&s;s, or their judgment. If <HI>any</HI> thing can make a per&s;on truly cheerful, it &s;hould be a <HI>good con|&s;cience.</HI> And true religion is doubly charming, when it wears a <HI>&s;mile.</HI></P>
<P>A melancholy countenance is, by no means, <HI>feminine.</HI> It is as remote from the true point of gracefulne&s;s, in the &s;ex, as ill-natured wit, or ironical pertne&s;s.</P>

<P>THOUGH Loui&s;a is the mo&s;t remote from <HI>prudery,</HI> of any woman I know, ea&s;y and acce&s;&s;ible to the other &s;ex, and cheerful, lively and <HI>uncon|&s;trained,</HI>

<P>Fa&s;hionable manners have been long attempting to bani&s;h delicacy, as a &s;ort of <HI>incumbrance;</HI> but no woman will ever <HI>long</HI> be lovely without it.

<P><HI>Little</HI> minds endeavour to &s;upport a con&s;equence by <HI>di&s;tance</HI> and <HI>hauteur.</HI> But this is a mi&s;take. <HI>True</HI> dignity ari&s;es from conde&s;cen&s;ion, and is &s;up|ported by noble actions.</P>
<P>Superciliou&s;ne&s;s is almo&s;t a certain mark of low birth, and ill breeding. People, who have ju&s;t emerged into greatne&s;s, think it nece&s;&s;ary to main|tain their &s;uperiority by a proud look and an high &s;tomach. The con&s;equence is <HI>general</HI> hatred and contempt.</P>
<P>In fact this proud, <HI>high-bearing</HI> re&s;erve is a very
<PB N="30" REF="023176_0181_0FBDDF72E6A7B0E0">great <HI>crime.</HI> Every per&s;on, that bears the image of his Maker, is entitled to our attentions, and in|deed our benevolence. Inferiority is, of <HI>it&s;elf,</HI> a &s;ufficient burden, without our endeavouring to <HI>aggravate</HI> it by ill-nature or neglect.</P>
<P>I have often heard Loui&s;a dwell, with rapture, on the entertainment and <HI>edification</HI> &s;he has receiv|ed in many <HI>cottages</HI> when &s;he has been carrying clothing, cordials or money to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in|habitants; and tell me which is the more digni|fied character? a woman, who would turn from her poor neighbours with di&s;dain, or one, who for her kindne&s;s and attention to them, is prai&s;ed, as often as her name is mentioned, and followed, whither&s;oever &s;he moveth, with their tears and with their ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P>There is not a greater charm in any character, than &s;uch a <HI>conde&s;cen&s;ion.</HI> A woman, thus forget|ting all her di&s;tinctions, to &s;ympathize with the unfortunate, mu&s;t captivate every man, who has either a &s;ingle grain of piety or under&s;tanding. Even the <HI>plaine&s;t face</HI> would be forgotten in &s;uch real and unaffected goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>The <HI>manner</HI> of Loui&s;a <HI>fini&s;hes</HI> her character. It is a beautiful bordering to all her graces and her virtues. It is impo&s;&s;ible for me to define, (what I mean by,) manner; yet no one can be, half an hour, in the company of this lady, without feeling its a&s;toni&s;hing effects. Though &s;he frequently &s;ays nothing, but what might have dropped from any other per&s;on, yet in <HI>her</HI> it becomes &s;o very in|tere&s;ting, as to command attention, and even to delight. She embelli&s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, in a wonderful manner, a look, a ge&s;ture, an attitude, nay even &s;ilence it|&s;elf.

<P>The be&s;t definition I can give of this quality mu&s;t be imperfect.

<P>It has, long, been my private opinion, that a good clergyman is more likely to have a dutiful and affectionate family, than a per&s;on of almo&s;t any other character. And I am not a little con|firmed in it by the in&s;tance before us.</P>
<P>Whoever &s;ees this happy pair, is delighted with that mutual e&s;teem and fondne&s;s, which revolving years have not been able to dimini&s;h, but only to mature; and mu&s;t form a very high idea of that union, which the <HI>licentious</HI> only endeavour to ridi|cule, becau&s;e they have not ta&s;te and innocence enough for its <HI>unpurcha&s;ed,</HI> and refined &s;weets. I have lately &s;pent a few days with this amiable group, and returned, quite di&s;gu&s;ted with my own &s;ituation. It appeared, uncommonly <HI>&s;olitary and in&s;ipid.</HI> I began to blame my books, as the ob|&s;tacle of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m, felicity, and to a&s;k philo&s;ophy and cold-hearted prudence, what joy they had to boa&s;t, if compared with the&s;e <HI>natural</HI> tran&s;ports of the &s;oul.</P>

Fortunately for my friend, a comfortable, <HI>pater|nal</HI> fortune, in conjunction with that, which he received with his lady, has placed him in very ea&s;y, and rather affluent, circum&s;tances. Provi|dence has crowned their virtuous friend&s;hip only with Loui&s;a; but indeed, in her alone, has rained down a <HI>profu&s;ion</HI> of its ble&s;&s;ings. In her, there|fore, all their cares and anxieties concenter; and her education, you may well &s;uppo&s;e, has not been neglected.</P>
<P>Her parents are both aver&s;e to boarding &s;chools, as in&s;piring a young per&s;on with improper notions, and undermining the ta&s;te for pure &s;implicity and dome&s;tic worth. She has, therefore, been always kept under their own, immediate in&s;pection; but her hours are as &s;trictly arranged, as they could have been, at any &s;chool, into a <HI>regular</HI> plan of employment. She has her allotted intervals for dome&s;tic duties, needle-work, reading, corre&s;|pondence, exerci&s;e and recreation; and every hour knows its particular engagement.</P>
<P>She opens every morning, and clo&s;es every day with an hymn of prai&s;e to her bountiful Creator, which is chanted to the harp&s;ichord, with &s;o &s;weet a voice, as I cannot even at this di&s;tance of time, recollect without emotion.</P>
<P>If you &s;aw the beautiful <HI>fancy-work,</HI> which has been wrought by this girl, in carpers, ba&s;kets of flowers, embroidery, &amp;c. you would imagine, that &s;he could have but little lei&s;ure for the improve|ment of her under&s;tanding. But a &s;trict <HI>economy</HI> of time, an invariable adherence to <HI>order,</HI> and an habit of <HI>early ri&s;ing</HI> have enabled her to do won|ders. Her father &s;uperintends that part of her education, which is connected with books; and
<PB N="34" REF="023176_0185_0FBDDF78E60D3DD0">has &s;uch an happy method of conveying his idea as wonderfully mixes in&s;truction with delight.</P>
<P>Natural hi&s;tory and botany, on fine days, they &s;tudy in the <HI>fields;</HI> and when the weather is le&s;s favourable, &s;he has &s;uch a collection of animals, in&s;ects, and other curio&s;ities as would adorn the mu&s;eum of a connoi&s;&s;eur. This is called her grot|to; and is placed in a &s;hady part of the garden, over-arched with an alcove of entwined elms.</P>
<P>Hi&s;tory, in the hands of her able in&s;tructor, be|comes a fund of un&s;peakable improvement. When events are recorded, &s;he is a&s;ked what <HI>cau&s;es</HI> gave them birth; what <HI>in&s;truments</HI> were made u&s;e of for their completion, and what traces &s;he can di&s;cover, of a wonderful and an all-wi&s;e Providence, govern|ing the whole.</P>
<P>Geography and chronology are in&s;eparable guides con&s;ulted on the occa&s;ion; and when <HI>characters</HI> are de&s;cribed, &s;he is interrogated con|cerning the <HI>prai&s;e-worthy</HI> or the <HI>reprehen&s;ible,</HI> in them; where the hi&s;torian has been too &s;paring of his prai&s;e, or extolled beyond the bounds of rea&s;on and of <HI>truth.</HI> Her &s;entiments, on all the&s;e &s;ubjects, are given, in her own language, upon paper; and afterwards corrected by the mature judgment and critical ta&s;te of her incomparable tutor.</P>
<P>On <HI>Sundays,</HI> &s;he prepares a conci&s;e abridgment of the &s;ermon, which undergoes the &s;ame rigid examination; and &s;he has a little volume, filled with &s;uch &s;acred reflections, as would not di&s;hon|our the under&s;tanding, or the repo&s;itory of a pro|fe&s;&s;ed divine.</P>
<P>You would &s;uppo&s;e from <HI>this</HI> account, that Loui&s;a would appear (what the world calls,) a
<PB N="35" REF="023176_0186_0FBDDF7A6578B660">very <HI>learned woman.</HI> No &s;uch thing. In a <HI>mixed</HI> company, you would not di&s;cern, that &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed any &s;uperior knowledge or advantage over her &s;ex, except in an elegant mode of expre&s;&s;ion. She en|ters into other people's views, feelings, intere&s;ts and concerns, with a politene&s;s, that very few po&s;&s;e&s;s; and conver&s;es with all her country neigh|bours, on &s;uch ea&s;y terms, as bani&s;h every un|plea&s;ant feeling of di&s;tance or re&s;traint.</P>
<P>The heart of this lovely girl is, all over, <HI>&s;ympa|thy and &s;oftne&s;s.</HI> The big tear trembles in her eye, on every trying occa&s;ion; and in her clo&s;et, along with a &s;mall, but well cho&s;en collection of books, &s;he has a little box, with this in&s;cription, "&s;acred to the poor." Into <HI>this,</HI> &s;he puts, every night, be|fore &s;he &s;leeps, &s;omething to be a fund for merit and di&s;tre&s;s. She enriches it with the &s;avings &s;he has made, by retrenching &s;ome expen&s;ive articles of dre&s;s or plea&s;ure. It is filled with money, that others would have &s;pent on plays, concerts or a&s;&s;emblies; and I will venture to &s;ay, that &s;he has infinitely &s;weeter mu&s;ic in her heart, and a more innocent, &s;parkling brilliance in her eyes, than any of the mo&s;t admired frequenters of the&s;e gay amu&s;ements.</P>

<P>FROM Loui&s;a's &s;trict con&s;inement and <HI>&s;y&s;tem|atic</HI> life you would conclude, perhaps, that &s;he had almo&s;t contracted a <HI>di&s;reli&s;h</HI> for books. But, indeed, it is far otherwi&s;e; her &s;tudies are her

<P>The garden is the &s;cene, where &s;he indulges all the luxury of her ta&s;te; and her rambles into it are as frequent, as the great variety of her avoca|tions will permit. One day, I found her in this retizement. The place was very happily fancied. Large clumps of trees, on both &s;ides, with their intervening foliage, had rendered it impervious to any human eye. Nature had wantoned with particular luxuriance. A clear, tran&s;parent &s;pring murmured through the valley. And it was fenc|ed, on both &s;ides, with a very lofty mound, ca&s;t up as on purpo&s;e, and planted with perennial &s;hrubs. A &s;hady arbour, in the middle, catching through a beautiful vi&s;ta, the &s;pire of the village church, invited to meditation and to repo&s;e. She was reclined here rather in a pen&s;ive attitude, read|ing Burke's E&s;&s;ays on the Beautiful and Sublime; and to me &s;he appeared, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, more en|chanting, more <HI>beautiful</HI> and more <HI>&s;ublime,</HI> than the admired work of that well known and admired author.</P>
<P>On another occa&s;ion, her mother being much indi&s;po&s;ed, &s;he had &s;tolen from the dome&s;tic circle, to indulge, at lei&s;ure, a &s;olitary grief. The book &s;he held in her hands, was Lord Lyttleton's Dia|logues of the Dead. The &s;oft melancholy vi&s;ible in her countenance, the very apparent agitation of
<PB N="37" REF="023176_0188_0FBDDF7D6611E920">her &s;pirits, and the grief, bur&s;ting through her animated eyes, formed a very intere&s;ting whole; whil&s;t her ob&s;ervations on a future life, on the comfort &s;he derived from the hope of conver&s;ing with her friends after death; on the probable na|ture and happine&s;s of heaven, and the permanency of virtuous friend&s;hip and affection, would no have di&s;graced any divine or philo&s;opher of the age.</P>
<P>A <HI>third</HI> time of her elopement, &s;he was reading the only novel, which &s;he permits her&s;elf <HI>to</HI> read, that of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on. Tears, like an April &s;hower, tinged with the &s;un, were mingled with her joy.</P>
<P>The book was opened, where the once-amiable Harriet Byron is <HI>now</HI> Lady Grandi&s;on; where the painful &s;u&s;pen&s;e of her virtuous, though pre|mature, attachment, is crowned by an eternal union with its object, and &s;he is kneeling to her ever-venerable grandmother, to implore a ble&s;&s;ing. "Heavens!" (&s;aid &s;he,) <Q>what an exqui&s;ite and inimitable painter was Richard&s;on! How over|whemled with admiration, e&s;teem and &s;elf-annihilation do I, always, feel my&s;elf, when I read the de&s;cription of his Harriet Byron. So much piety, yet &s;o much cheerfulne&s;s; &s;uch filial duty, tenderne&s;s, affection, &s;o exqui&s;ite a &s;en&s;ibility; &s;o deep and glowing a pa&s;&s;ion, con|ducted with &s;o much delicacy; &s;uch beauty of per&s;on, lo&s;t in &s;o much greater &s;weetne&s;s of temper, and &s;uch a winning candour and open|ne&s;s of heart, complete my idea of every thing that is noble and aimable in woman.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I never read this writer without weeping. He had an amazing talent for the pathetic and
<PB N="38" REF="023176_0189_0FBDDF7EE6F868F0">de&s;criptive. He opens all the &s;luices of tender|ne&s;s, and tears flow down our cheeks, like a river. And (what is mo&s;t of all,) I never open his book without feeling my &s;entiments elevated and &s;ublimed, and my heart more alive to all the &s;ugge&s;tions of piety and virtue. If <HI>all</HI> novels had been written on &s;uch a plan, they would, doubtle&s;s, have been very excellent vehicles of wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>la&s;t</HI> time I broke in upon Loui&s;a's retire|ment, &s;he was <HI>&s;urrounded</HI> with authors. She &s;eem|ed bent upon indulging her elegant ta&s;te, in all its extravagance.</P>
<P>Addi&s;on's papers on the Plea&s;ures of Imagina|tion; &s;everal pieces of Mi&s;s Seward: Ma&s;on's Engli&s;h Garden; Ario&s;to, with Hoole's Tran&s;la|tion, and Webb's Inquiry into the Beauties of Painting, together with a Collection of Poems, lay, in promi&s;cuous dignity, be&s;ide her. She has accu&s;tomed her&s;elf to enter into a &s;ort of com|mon-place book, pa&s;&s;ages, which &s;he thinks parti|cularly &s;triking.

<P>The fir&s;t, poetical ro&s;e &s;he had plucked, was from the Italian poet, Ario&s;to. It was his beau|tiful picture of Alcina, the enchantre&s;s. I will tran&s;cribe a few of the lines, and the tran&s;lation, though a mode&s;t blu&s;h tinged her cheeks, whil&s;t I read the de&s;cription.</P>

<P>I WILL now give you another picture. It is that of a young lady, whom I have lately had the honour of &s;eeing, ju&s;t arrived from a <HI>boarding &s;chool.</HI> It is Lady Harriet &mdash;. But I will not undertake to &s;ay, that the features will plea&s;e you. They are certainly different from tho&s;e of Loui&s;a.</P>
<P>She was almo&s;t ince&s;&s;antly practi&s;ing little arts, and adju&s;ting all her airs and graces to engage ad|miration. When &s;he &s;poke, &s;he minced her &s;ylla|bles, and when &s;he <HI>looked,</HI> &s;he threw an <HI>unnatural</HI> vivacity into her eyes. She is a fine, blooming girl; and, if &s;he had not taken &s;uch uncommon
<PB N="42" REF="023176_0193_0FBDDF84E7CA5338"><HI>pains</HI> to plea&s;e, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have charmed every beholder.</P>
<P>How long will it be before people learn, that nothing engages &s;o much, as the ea&s;e of nature? An artle&s;s <HI>&s;implicity</HI> is the highe&s;t charm. What|ever <HI>&s;ludies</HI> admiration, rai&s;es di&s;gu&s;t. Sy&s;tem and con&s;traint de&s;troy <HI>ea&s;e.</HI> And ea&s;e is the parent of all the graces.</P>
<P>It is the bu&s;ine&s;s of education to lop off &s;ome little, <HI>luxuriant</HI> boughs from the tree of nature, but not to <HI>con&s;train</HI> it, that it cannot vegetate, or give to every branch, an <HI>unnatural</HI> direction. I &s;hould prefer the plain, hone&s;t awkwardne&s;s of a more country girl to over-acted refinement.</P>
<P>Though Lady Harriet&mdash;is not yet four|teen years old, &s;he has more than the airs and for|wardne&s;s of a woman. Who can have taught this girl, that ro&s;es are expected to open <HI>all at once,</HI> and not by degrees?</P>
<P>Timidity and diffidence are the mo&s;t attracting qualities of a girl; a countenance always mode&s;t, and unde&s;igning; a tongue, often &s;ilent, and ears, always attentive.</P>
<P>Boarding &s;chools, it &s;hould &s;eem, may be com|pared to <HI>hot-beds.</HI> They bring fruits and flowers quickly to their growth. But they have not their proper e&s;&s;ence, healthine&s;s or flavour.</P>
<P>The <HI>girli&s;h</HI> &s;tate is &s;o plea&s;ing, in it&s;elf, that we wi&s;h not to &s;ee it exchanged, before its time, for the caution, the artifices, or the &s;ubtil policy of age.</P>
<P>It is de&s;irable, that a girl &s;hould retain, as long as po&s;&s;ible, the innocent dre&s;s, manners, habit and &s;entiments of childhood. She will never be more captivating, when &s;he is a woman. Natural,
<PB N="43" REF="023176_0194_0FBDDF8664BD51B8"><HI>untortured</HI> ringlets, &s;a&s;hes, frocks, &amp;c. are &s;uperior to all the laboured trappings of fa&s;hion. Nature has given to every <HI>age,</HI> as well as to every <HI>&s;ea&s;on</HI> of the year, its <HI>appropriate</HI> charms. We &s;hould be greatly di&s;appointed, if the &s;oft breezes and the plea&s;ing, new born &s;cenery of the &s;pring were im|patient to di&s;&s;olve into the &s;ultry heats of &s;ummer.</P>
<P>A <HI>forward</HI> girl always alarms me. Indelicacy, imprudence and improper connections &s;tart up to my view. I tremble for her friends, and &s;ee her hi&s;tory, <HI>gradually,</HI> unfolding into indi&s;cretion.</P>
<P>Children are apt enough, of <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> to a&s;pire into womanhood. A governe&s;s &s;hould <HI>check</HI> this &s;pirit, and nip it in the bud. A long nonage, if I may &s;o call it, is &s;avourable to your &s;ex. Dur|ing <HI>this</HI> period, a girl is acquiring &s;ome <HI>&s;olid</HI> im|provement. When &s;he fancies her&s;elf a woman, company, plea&s;ures and conver&s;ation with the other &s;ex, <HI>unhinge</HI> her mind, and bid unquiet thoughts take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her fancy.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR LUCY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I GAVE you a de&s;cription of the <HI>true</HI> delicacy of Loui&s;a. I have lately &s;een it over-acted by <HI>ano|ther</HI> per&s;on, in &s;uch a manner, as to di&s;gu&s;t me beyond expre&s;&s;ion. The virtues and graces have
<PB N="47" REF="023176_0198_0FBDDF8C672214E8">all their limits. If pu&s;hed further, they degene|rate into the very oppo&s;ite defects. The lady, who hurt my feelings, had not <HI>con&s;idered</HI> this max|im. Or &s;he had not ta&s;te and &s;en&s;e enough to ap|ply it. <HI>Her</HI> delicacy was ab&s;olute <HI>prudery and af|fectation.</HI></P>
<P>True delicacy is nothing more, than the refine|ment of <HI>mode&s;ty.</HI> It is the &s;en&s;itive plant of woman, which gives the quicke&s;t notice of approaching danger, and trembles at the bare <HI>apprehen&s;ion</HI> of any thing, which can injure her honour, her &s;afety, or repo&s;e. So amiable in it&s;elf, one cannot won|der, that every female wi&s;hes to be thought in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. But it is a &s;hy and timid plant, and lea&s;t di&s;plays it&s;elf, where it is known to exi&s;t in the highe&s;t cultivation.</P>
<P>Some women are &s;o <HI>over-loaden</HI> with this virtue, as to be almo&s;t in&s;ufferable in &s;ociety; &s;o <HI>outrage|ou&s;ly</HI> virtuous, that they render all their purity and principles &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>This <HI>tremblingly</HI> mode&s;t female, in a company, of which I had lately the honour of making one, on hearing that a number of gentlemen were com|ing to drink tea, &s;eemed very much alarmed, and pretended to make an apology for retiring. Now this was nothing le&s;s than downright <HI>hypocri&s;y.</HI> If it had been po&s;&s;ible to look into her heart, proba|bly, at the very moment, it was thrilling with joy, for the agreable information.</P>
<P>Every woman in the world is fond of our &s;ocie|ty, unle&s;s &s;he had formed &s;ome <HI>particular</HI> attach|ment, and wi&s;hes to indulge the greater luxury of &s;olitary recollection. It is a <HI>natural</HI> and an inno|cent pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;ure, and it would be the <HI>fal&s;e&s;t</HI> delicacy to di&s;own it. We always <HI>&s;u&s;pect</HI> the&s;e prudes.
<PB N="48" REF="023176_0199_0FBDDF8DE5157050">We fancy, that their mode&s;ty dimini&s;hes in private in proportion, as it appears to dilate and to mag|nify it&s;elf, before the public in&s;pection.</P>
<P>Upon hearing, again, that a young lady had been &s;mart and lively with a gentleman of her ac|quaintance, &s;he <HI>ble&s;&s;ed her &s;tars,</HI> and wondered, how &s;uch forwardne&s;s e&s;caped <HI>reprobation!</HI> Now this girl acted from <HI>nature.</HI> The gentleman was agreeable. She felt the plea&s;ure. She dared to expre&s;s it. She wi&s;hed to entertain him, and &s;he did right. The other blamed her from envy or from affectation.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>over-nice</HI> and <HI>over-virtuous</HI> people would do well to con&s;ider, that an odious re&s;traint would bani&s;h all the &s;weets of an intercour&s;e betwixt the &s;exes, and fix a moping and a di&s;mal gloom on the face of the creation. It is no breach of true deli|cacy to comply with the innocent dictates of <HI>nature.</HI> A woman may, very mode&s;tly, avow a virtuous at|tachment. She may expre&s;s an approbation of particular men, and do ju&s;tice to their merit. She may &s;hew a fondne&s;s for being in their company. She may chat, in a &s;ociable and an ea&s;y manner with them; nay &s;he may think of being a <HI>wife</HI> or a <HI>mother,</HI> without injuring the fine&s;t tints of this laudable quality. Providence intended her for &s;uch circum&s;tances and connections, and they need not a <HI>blu&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>That <HI>piety</HI> is mo&s;t &s;olid, which affects no gloomy rigours, or &s;ingularities; which makes no noi&s;e, and courts no ob&s;ervation. It is &s;o with delicacy. <HI>That</HI> is <HI>always</HI> the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite, which is lea&s;t <HI>o&s;tentatious.</HI> An <HI>un&s;tudied</HI> openne&s;s and &s;implicity of manners are the &s;tronge&s;t &s;ymptoms of a guiltle&s;s heart, and a virtu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">s intention. Tho&s;e young
<PB N="49" REF="023176_0200_0FBDDF8F6580BD10">people are, generally the mo&s;t amiable, that are mo&s;t undi&s;gui&s;ed. Having nothing to <HI>conceal,</HI> they have &s;tudied no <HI>art.</HI> They may, <HI>&s;ometimes,</HI> give way to little &s;allies, which the <HI>rigid</HI> would con|demn; but they are &s;allies of good <HI>humour,</HI> and genero&s;ity forgives them.</P>
<P>Another in&s;tance, in which this Lady offended me, and yet from an <HI>over</HI> de&s;ire of plea&s;ing, was by a&s;&s;uming a mi&s;taken dignity. In fact, true dig|nity, in any per&s;on, con&s;i&s;ts in the <HI>virtues;</HI> humi|lity, conde&s;cen&s;ion, candour; and is only &s;up|ported by <HI>great</HI> qualities, or by a train of amiable actions. But in a <HI>woman's</HI> manner, if &s;he con&s;id|ered only what is <HI>graceful,</HI> there &s;hould always be more of the lovely, than the great; of the enga|ging, than the magnificent or &s;ublime. Her <HI>au|thority</HI> &s;hould be lo&s;t in <HI>&s;weetne&s;s;</HI> the dazzling, in the mild.</P>
<P>Women were not formed to <HI>awe</HI> us by their ma|je&s;ty, but to <HI>&s;ooth</HI> us by their graces. We may be &s;truck with a Cleopatra, but we <HI>love</HI> an Antiope. A Catharine may <HI>a&s;toni&s;h</HI> us, but we are <HI>charmed</HI> with a &mdash; C &mdash; e.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVI.</HEAD>
<P>THE tour of affectation is unbounded. I have ju&s;t returned from a circle of ladies, who have been entertaining me with a very long harangue, on (what they choo&s;e to call,) <HI>fine feelings.</HI> This is quite a fa&s;hionable &s;ubject. The truth is, &s;en&s;i|bility
<PB N="50" REF="023176_0201_0FBDDF90E53D7A50">is con&s;idered, as a matter of refinement, and a proof of being rai&s;ed above the vulgar; and ma|ny young people, I do believe, would be more hurt by any reflection on their &s;en&s;ibility, than if you &s;u&s;pected their piety and virtue.</P>
<P>This <HI>rage</HI> for the compliment of fine feelings &s;eems to have originated in the writings of Sterne. His very eccentric talents were always contriving &s;ome fictitious tale of woe, and bidding the tear to drop; the general circulation of his works, and the novels which have, &s;ince, &s;prung up in the <HI>hot-bed</HI> of France, and of our own <HI>imaginations,</HI> have led young people to fancy every grace and almo&s;t eve|ry virtue, comprized under this &s;pecious and com|prehen&s;ive name.</P>
<P>Nothing certainly can be more nau&s;eous and di&s;gu&s;ting, than an <HI>affected</HI> &s;en&s;ibility, as nothing is more charming, than the pure and genuine. But, with all this <HI>noi&s;e</HI> about it, I am far from knowing whether there is much of the real in the world. They, who would be thought to have it in perfection, are only in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>artificial.</HI> For is it &s;en&s;ibility to prefer the turbid plea&s;ures of <HI>midnight</HI> to opening buds and blo&s;&s;oms; to the le&s;&s;ons, which the Creator gives in every vegetable and every in&s;ect; to undi&s;turbed contemplation; to the raptures of devotion, or all the fair and enchanting land&s;capes of creation; to the &s;enti|ment the ta&s;te and knowledge, that are di&s;played in the works of the mo&s;t learned and ingenious men, or the entertainment and delight and profit, we might receive from the volume of revelation? Is it &s;en&s;ibility to form a &s;acred connection with one per|&s;on, and encourage a criminal attachment to ano|ther? Is it &s;en&s;ibility to leave the charms, the cries, the wants and tender pleadings of an infant offs|pring,
<PB N="51" REF="023176_0202_0FBDDF9265246C40">for the vain and peri&s;hable &s;plendour of a ball, a birth-night, or a levee?</P>
<P>Every <HI>thinking</HI> per&s;on mu&s;t be di&s;gu&s;ted with <HI>&s;uch</HI> a kind of &s;en&s;ibility. Rigid critici&s;m would call it by a very har&s;h name, and &s;ociety has rea&s;on to reprobate its tendency. Yet Sterne's &s;en&s;ibili|ty led to many of the&s;e evils; and who knows not, that a thou&s;and ladies, who <HI>vaunt fine</HI> feelings, are dupes to this ridiculous illu&s;ion?</P>
<P><HI>True</HI> feeling is of a very different complexion. Like genius, it mu&s;t come from <HI>heaven;</HI> indeed it is a part <HI>of</HI> genius; and, like that, is very rare. It depends, con&s;iderably on temperament and or|ganization; is much heightened by particular ad|vantages of education, &s;ociety, friends, reading. ob&s;ervation and reflection; and will generally be quicke&s;t in the mo&s;t elevated minds. But, even when it is mo&s;t gennine and poignant, it will never be a guide, &s;afely to be tru&s;ted, till it is governed by rea&s;on, checked by di&s;cretion, and moulded by that religion, which requires us to devote every <HI>in&s;tinct</HI> we have, to the glory of God, and to the happine&s;s of all our fellow-creatures, and of our|&s;elves.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>con&s;ecrated,</HI> it is a &s;ource of the pure&s;t and the riche&s;t ble&s;&s;ings. It is the parent of an earne&s;t devotion to him, who gave it, and of a thou&s;and ble&s;&s;ings to mankind. It <HI>appropriates</HI> all the &s;or|rows of its brethren; it feels in every woe, <Q>re|joices with them, that do rejoice, and weeps with them that weep;</Q> and doubly alive to all the exerci&s;es, of piety, in blo&s;&s;oms, in flowers, in minerals, in vegetables, in &s;tars, in planets, in the azure vault of heaven, in thunders, in &s;torms, in earthquakes, in volcanos, in the revolutions of

<P>It is with this, as with every other grace and virtue. There is a fal&s;e and a true. The fal&s;e is loud and noi&s;y, much addicted to <HI>egoti&s;m,</HI> and ob|trudes it&s;elf on public ob&s;ervation in order to gra|tify its own conceit and vanity; the other, mode&s;t, timid, retired <HI>&s;hrinks</HI> into it&s;elf; feels, but &s;ays no|thing of its feelings; &s;uffers, but conceals its &s;uf|ferings; rejoices, but does not vaunt its joy, and is too <HI>delicate</HI> in its nature, and too much <HI>inte|re&s;ted</HI> to &s;olicit pity, or to court approbation. The one is an humble fire work, which cracks an &s;parkles; the other is that lightning, which, in an <HI>in&s;tant,</HI> electrifies and &s;hocks; this is the offs|pring of heaven; that, the artificial creature of the world.</P>
<P>I will conclude this letter with a contra&s;t taken from life. Flavia lies in bed till noon; as &s;oon as &s;he ri&s;es, &s;he opens a novel, or a play-book; weeps profu&s;ely at <HI>imaginary</HI> di&s;tre&s;s, &s;ips &s;trong tea, till &s;he is almo&s;t in hy&s;terics; concludes, that &s;en&s;ibility is all her own, and is perpetually com|plaining how her feelings are &s;hocked with &s;uch a room, or &s;uch a pro&s;pect, the coar&s;ene&s;s of <HI>this</HI> character, and of <HI>that</HI> conver&s;ation, and how the &s;ight of a poor beggar gives her the <HI>vapours.</HI></P>
<P>Emily never &s;ays a word about her feelings, ri&s;es with the dawn, endeavours to fortify her body with air and exerci&s;e, and her mind with devotion; is oftener &s;een with her <HI>bible,</HI> than any other book; &s;eems plea&s;ed with every per&s;on and every object about her, and puts on a cheerful &s;mile, when her

<P>I WILL give you candidly, at your reque&s;t, my opinion of &s;ome celebrated writers. If you differ from me on reading them, it may produce a colli|&s;ion of &s;entiments, which will be favourable to our mutual improvement.

<P>Voltaire is a graceful, but a <HI>&s;uperficial</HI> writer. He had more ta&s;te than genius, and more liveline&s;s than authenticity. Volatile in his re&s;earches, im|patient

<P>If I mu&s;t recommend <HI>any</HI> of his works, it &s;hould be his Henriade. But I do not wi&s;h you to culti|vate any clo&s;e acquaintance with &s;o erroneous, and &s;eductive an author.</P>
<P>Rou&s;&s;eau is very fanciful, but very engaging. His whims are all the ebullitions of genius; and, as &s;uch, they plea&s;e. Nothing was ever &s;o &s;trange|ly romantic, as his Emilius, or &s;y&s;tem of Educa|tion; a mere, <HI>paper</HI> edifice of children, which the fir&s;t and gentle&s;t touch of experience totally de|&s;troys. You may read it to be amu&s;ed, not to be in&s;tructed.</P>
<P>Why, you will naturally a&s;k, were the&s;e di&s;tin|gui&s;hed men enemies to revelation? The truth is, genius di&s;dains to move in &s;hackles, or to tread <HI>beaten</HI> paths. Originality is its con&s;tant aim. It mu&s;t candidly, be owned, that revelation has &s;ome doctrines, <HI>&s;uperior</HI> to our rea&s;on.

<P>What real critic mu&s;t not &s;mile at his deci&s;ion, when he boldly pronounces the <HI>Henriade</HI> of Vol|taire, &s;uperior to the Iliad, the Aeneid, and to Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t? Perhaps, this poem may be free from &s;ome, little <HI>&s;pots</HI> of the others; but then it is not a &s;un, who&s;e fire con&s;umes every &s;lighter blem|i&s;h, and leaves the reader wrapped in a profound enthu&s;ia&s;m and amazement.</P>
<P>If it &s;urpa&s;&s;es them in a cold correctne&s;s, has it their &s;ublimity, their energy and fire? If it has not their excre&s;cences, has it their impa&s;&s;ioned beauties? Compared with the Iliad, or with the work of Milton, it is a neat &s;pruce &s;ir, placed near a &s;preading and maje&s;tic oak. It is a gentle rivu|let
<PB N="56" REF="023176_0207_0FBDDF99E7FCCD18">let by the &s;ide of a foaming torrent, or a magnifi|cent ocean. It is a pretty artificial fire-work, playing in the neighbourhood of a tremendous Aetna.</P>
<P>But Voltaire was a <HI>congenial</HI> writer, and a con|genial &s;oul. In prai&s;ing his <HI>&s;uperficial</HI> talents, Che&s;terfield did an honour to his own.</P>
<P>If this writer had not been a peer, who would have read his letters with &s;o much avidity? All he has produced, would, immediately have peri&s;hed with the other <HI>frothy</HI> bubbles of the day. His eternal repetition of "graces, graces," makes one ab&s;o|lutely &s;ick; and the regimen he pre&s;cribes for the attainment of them, creates him an enemy, in every friend of religion and of virtue.</P>
<P>Society &s;hould <HI>burn</HI> his books. All the women, in the world, &s;hould form an <HI>unanimous</HI> confedera|cy again&s;t him. He has done every thing in his power to render them dete&s;table; <HI>they</HI> &s;hould do every thing in <HI>theirs,</HI> to make the infamy of his character, immortal.</P>
<P>Read him, to de&s;pi&s;e his opinions and maxims. Read him that you may <HI>re&s;cue</HI> the honours of your &s;ex, and give the lie, in your own example, to every <HI>libel</HI> he has uttered, and every &s;candal he has endeavoured to propagate through the world.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR LUCY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH, from principle, a declaimer a|gain&s;t novels, yet of <HI>one</HI> writer, who goes under this name, I profe&s;s my&s;elf a pa&s;&s;ionate admirer. I mean Richard&s;on. His works, indeed, are not to be examined by the &s;trict laws of a fa&s;ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ous critici&s;m. They have many <HI>luxuriancies,</HI> and too much <HI>prolixity.</HI> The language is natural and ea&s;y, but it is not <HI>conden&s;ed</HI> into the elegant con|ci&s;ene&s;s
<PB N="59" REF="023176_0210_0FBDDF9E65AC2A40">and <HI>energy</HI> of the ancients. Richard&s;on was a &s;tranger to the inimitable models of Greece and Rome. He was not a <HI>cla&s;&s;ic;</HI> but he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a mo&s;t exten&s;ive knowledge of human life and manners; his judgment was &s;trong and penetra|ting; his ta&s;te, accurate; his &s;en&s;ibility, exqui|&s;ite; his imagination, wonderful; and his heart, impa&s;&s;ioned. Ma&s;ter of the human character, he knew all its <HI>meandrings.</HI> Ma&s;ter of the human &s;oul, he penetrated into all its foldings and rece&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>With the &s;ame breath, and in the &s;ame moment, he melts, he tran&s;ports, he elevates, he dignifies, he convinces, and in&s;tructs. Pathos is all his own. <Q>He opens the harde&s;t rocks by the mere force of his narrative, and the waters flow.</Q></P>
<P>Richard&s;on was, indeed, a writer of no trifling magnitude. He was a genius of no ordinary kind. Degrade this <HI>ethereal</HI> &s;pirit, as you will, it will mount up to its kindred &s;kies. Call him a <HI>noveli&s;t,</HI> his merit ri&s;es above names and forms. <HI>The&s;e</HI> cannot deba&s;e his talents. Handle this &s;ub|&s;tance, as roughly as you plea&s;e, it returns, with an ela&s;tic vigour, to its u&s;ual &s;hape, and defies oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>But the excellency of his <HI>intention</HI> is above all prai&s;e. The intere&s;ts of virtue and religion were near his heart; and he cho&s;e the epi&s;tolatory plan merely to engage the attention of his readers, and that imagination might lend its livelie&s;t charms to <HI>animate</HI> his precepts.</P>
<P>What a pattern of all virtues and graces is his Grandi&s;on! What a lovely and fini&s;hed girl, is his Harriet Byron! What an unruffled piety! What a melting affection! What filial duty to her aged grandmother? What a kind &s;ympathy
<PB N="60" REF="023176_0211_0FBDDF9FE53B6710">with all her friends! What &s;en&s;ibility, yet what prudence! What tenderne&s;s, yet what di&s;cretion appear in her character! How nicely is her &s;eri|ou&s;ne&s;s mixed with vivavity, her fine &s;en&s;e with mode&s;ty, and her frankne&s;s, with decorum! How fondly does &s;he love, yet how delicately does &s;he manage and regulate the flame!</P>
<P>When &s;he pined, in &s;ecret, with an unconquera|ble attachment, what cheerfulne&s;s to all her friends bur&s;t through the heavy gloom, that lowered on her mind! What fear of giving any pain to others, though comfortle&s;s her&s;elf! What veneration did &s;he expre&s;s for the unhappy Clementina! What a generous concern for the innocent, girli&s;h emo|tions of Emily! What an unaffected friend&s;hip for the lively Lady G &mdash;, and when &s;he was really addre&s;&s;ed by her Grandi&s;on, with what an open frankne&s;s, yet what a guarded delicacy and invo|luntary confu&s;ion, did &s;he tell him that he had the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her &s;oul!</P>
<P>How venerable and engaging has this writer made the character of a clergyman, in the ca&s;e of Dr. Bartlett! How judiciou&s;ly has he mixed the pa&s;tor, with the friend, and combined the mo&s;t rigid principles, with the &s;ofte&s;t and mo&s;t attrac|tive graces. What innocence, integrity, and what prudence and caution about interfering in <HI>family</HI> concerns, has he given, in another work, to Dr. Lewen! What an <HI>independent</HI> &s;pi|it, likewi&s;e; what a leaning to the &s;ide of the unfortunate Clari&s;&s;a, in oppo&s;ition to all the greate&s;t of her friends; what a glowing, univer&s;al benevolence; what a &s;erene, and undi&s;&s;embled piety! And how &s;trikingly has he contra&s;ted <HI>both</HI> with the cunning hypocri&s;y and
<PB N="61" REF="023176_0212_0FBDDFA16B05EA80">pedantic affectation of another per&s;on, who, like|wi&s;e, wore, without really <HI>de&s;erving,</HI> &s;o &s;acred a ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">!</P>
<P>In oppo&s;ition to modern cu&s;toms, which, under a <HI>fal&s;e</HI> idea of greatne&s;s, would trample on &s;acred ceremonies, and bring the holy ordinances of reli|gion, to their own <HI>fire-&s;ides,</HI> in a manner, which dive&s;ts them of all &s;olemnity and decorum, what an invincible attachment does his Grandi&s;on di&s;|play to all the <HI>decencies</HI> and duties of the church! What a reluctance does he expre&s;s again&s;t having his marriage <HI>de&s;ecrated</HI> by a <HI>private</HI> celebration; and how does he oblige his timid and his blu&s;hing Harriet to vow at the <HI>altar,</HI> in the pre&s;ence of God, and in the face of day, her obedience, and her affection! In fact the&s;e outward <HI>decencies</HI> are the very fences of piety. Break them down, and the &s;acred enclo&s;ure will &s;oon become <Q>common and unclean.</Q></P>
<P>If, in &s;hort, I wi&s;hed a girl to be every thing, that was <HI>great,</HI> I would have her continually &s;tudy his Clari&s;&s;a. If I was ambitious to make her every thing, that was <HI>lovely,</HI> &s;he &s;hould &s;pend <HI>her days and nights,</HI> in contemplating his Byron.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t, however, confe&s;s a &s;trong preference for the work of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on. The read|ing of Clari&s;&s;a leaves, upon the mind, too melan|choly impre&s;&s;ions. Her di&s;tre&s;&s;es are too deep and too <HI>unvaried</HI> for &s;en&s;ibility to bear. She was every thing, that was virtuous, and we look up with ad|miration. She was every thing, that was mi&s;era|ble, and we look <HI>down</HI> with de&s;pair. We are tempted to fancy, that <Q>there is no reward for the righteous, nor any God that judgeth the earth.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="023176_0213_0FBDDFA2E507DFA8">
There is a certain point, <HI>beyond</HI> which our pa&s;|&s;ions will not bear to be racked. Beyond it even &s;ympathy, the lovelie&s;t of them all, turns into the wildne&s;s of de&s;pair. Virtue may have its &s;or|rows and its trials; but they &s;hould not be <HI>perpetu|al.</HI> Hope would cea&s;e to bloom, and the year be|come intolerable, if it was wholly compo&s;ed of a dull and dreary winter, without a &s;pring. If Pro|vidence did not, generally, interfere in favour of its &s;aints, religion, I &s;hould &s;u&s;pect, would &s;oon lo&s;e one of its &s;tronge&s;t encouragements, and mo&s;t &s;overeign &s;upports.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Byron is always lovely, and always en|chanting. Her virtues are more within the reach of mortality. Her afflictions are le&s;s poignant; and when her long attachment is crowned with &s;ucce&s;s, every good mind feels a plea&s;ure, too big for expre&s;&s;ion. We are happy for Clari&s;&s;a, only when &s;he is <HI>dead.</HI> We are very agreeably inter|e&s;ted for Mi&s;s Byron, through every period of her life, and <HI>Lady Grandi&s;on</HI> charms us into congratu|lating triumph.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXI.</HEAD>
<P>YOU &s;ay very truly, that the pictures of Rich|ard&s;on are drawn above life; that Sir Charles Grandi&s;on never exi&s;ted, except in idea, nor &s;o accompli&s;hed a woman, as Harriet Byron.</P>
<P>All this is granted. Mortality does not admit of perfection. Light and &s;hade go together. Foibles and perfections are an <HI>in&s;eparable</HI> mixture. The rich &s;oil, which produces great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ents, by the &s;ame prolific energy, nur&s;es the ranke&s;t weeds.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="023176_0214_0FBDDFA467D39E20">
But what is all this again&s;t his writings? Why people, you &s;ay, are deterred from attempting to imitate &s;o exalted a pattern. But that would be a mark of an ignoble &s;oul, and of a luke warmne&s;s in the cau&s;e of religion and virtue. If we de&s;pair of attaining to all their <HI>perfections,</HI> is it nothing to <HI>approximate,</HI> as nearly as we can? Is it not a noble and a glorious emulation, at lea&s;t, to exert our <HI>utmo&s;t</HI> &s;trength, when we are running the race of immortality?</P>
<P>The founder of our holy religion is much more highly rai&s;ed above our imitation, and yet do not the &s;criptures pre&s;s us to make the nece&s;&s;ary at|tempt? Who ever thought this pattern blameable, becau&s;e &s;o <HI>exalted?</HI> Or whoever dreamed of remit|ting his endeavours, becau&s;e he could not reach the <HI>&s;ublimity</HI> of its virtues?</P>
<P>The one, you will &s;ay, was real; the other is fictitious; this is human; that was divine.</P>
<P>True; but are we not to copy this divinity, in our <HI>degree?</HI> And who can blame fancy for pre|&s;enting us with a <HI>perfect</HI> mirror of goodne&s;s? If imagination can be u&s;ed to an important purpo&s;e, this, I think, is the plan; if it can be <HI>&s;anctified</HI> to aid the intere&s;ts of piety, this appears the mode of &s;anctification. It is only to be blamed, and it then becomes, in all the&s;e books, a mo&s;t dangerous and unholy principle, when it exhibits &s;cenes and ima|ges to inflame tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, which &s;hould always be, religiou&s;ly, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Nor do I blu&s;h, on the whole, cautious as I &s;hould be, to have borne this humble te&s;timony to the merit of the author of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, to have offered my unavailing incen&s;e, at his &s;hrine. If I dur&s;t <HI>preach</HI> in &s;ome &s;uch manner, I
<PB N="64" REF="023176_0215_0FBDDFA5E5B6F7E0">could make more converts. The pulpit will never have its full influence and effect, till <HI>argument</HI> is mixed with &s;trong appeals to the <HI>heart;</HI> and till, whil&s;t the judgment is convinced, the imagination is permitted by lively, de&s;criptive and energetic &s;allies, to captivate the &s;oul.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR LUCY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I REJOICE to find you di&s;gu&s;ted with Tri&s;tram Shandy. I never thought the&s;e writings fit for a lady.</P>
<P>Let me candidly a&s;k our modern fair ones? could they bear to hear &s;uch <HI>conver&s;ations,</HI> without blu&s;hing, or expre&s;&s;ing their contempt? And &s;hould not then the eye be as cha&s;te, as the ear? The fir&s;t, indeed, can be gratified in private. But can that delicacy be very exqui&s;ite, which can re|gale, when alone, on &s;entiments and de&s;criptions, from which, in <HI>public,</HI> it <HI>affects</HI> to turn away with indignation and abhorrence?</P>
<P>I have always, in private lamented, that Sterne was a clergyman. He might be a lively, humor|ous companion, but he had too much <HI>levity</HI> for this profe&s;&s;ion. It is true, he had talents, but what is <HI>ungoverned</HI> genius, but a violent flame, which burns, in&s;tead of warming, and dazzles, where it &s;hould enlighten and direct?</P>
<P>This writer has done inexpre&s;&s;ible mi&s;chief. He has opened wide the flood-gates of indecency, and an overwhelming torrent has poured on the
<PB N="65" REF="023176_0216_0FBDDFA765ABA188">land. He has conveyed <HI>indelicate</HI> ideas into the minds of young people, under the &s;pecious vehicle of &s;entiment, and he has dignified <HI>eventual</HI> crimi|nality with the fal&s;e, in&s;idious title of <HI>involuntary</HI> attachment. The corrupted and unblu&s;hing fair has gloried in her &s;hame. She has appealed for her ju&s;tification, from the <HI>gro&s;&s;ne&s;s</HI> of pa&s;&s;ion, to &s;ecret and <HI>irre&s;i&s;tible</HI> feelings of the heart.</P>
<P>It is a ju&s;t compliment to the pre&s;ent age, that the be&s;t writers pre&s;erve more decorum. An <HI>in|delicate</HI> allu&s;ion would, now, be e&s;teemed an un|pardonable offence again&s;t the public ta&s;te. Even the <HI>&s;tage</HI> is con&s;iderably reformed. It was far otherwi&s;e in (what was called) our <HI>Augu&s;tan</HI> age. Almo&s;t every author of <HI>that</HI> period (Addi&s;on ex|cepted,) breathes &s;omething of indelicacy. In many pa&s;&s;ages, Swift is intolerable; Pope inde|cent; and even Bolingbroke, with all his claims to birth, as well as eloquence, is not without &s;ome <HI>gro&s;s</HI> ideas, and &s;ome vulgar expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>But the great corrupter of them all was Swift. The <HI>re&s;ervoir</HI> of filthine&s;s; all the &s;eparate &s;treams might claim him for their parent &s;ource. I have already given my &s;entiments of this author. It is not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;well the invective, or add any thing to the charges, adduced again&s;t him. His abilities I never &s;u&s;pected; but I always called in que&s;tion his temper and his heart.</P>
<P>Panegyri&s;ts, however, have enumerated his many virtues. To Ireland, they &s;ay, he was a &s;kilful patriot; to the church, a defender, and to the poor, a friend.</P>
<P>For the honour of human nature, I will not en|deavour to put a negative on the&s;e virtues. Let
<PB N="66" REF="023176_0217_0FBDDFA8E61DB890">them all be taken into the <HI>general</HI> account. The balance will not &s;till be heavy in his favour.</P>

<P>WHATEVER devotional writers increa&s;e your piety, by all means u&s;e them. I <HI>did</HI> not men|tion in my catalogue, <HI>Mrs. Rowe's Devout Exer|ci&s;es of the Heart,</HI> with which you are &s;o much plea&s;ed, becau&s;e to <HI>me</HI> they appeared, <HI>over&s;trained,</HI> and rather rhap&s;odies of a fervid imagination, than the dictates of a cool and a di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate judgment. But if they really warm and edify, <HI>that</HI> is the great and ultimate end of all religious writings; and no one can pretend, in this re&s;pect, to pre|&s;cribe to the con&s;cience or the feelings of others.</P>
<P>From my ob&s;ervations, however, upon life and manners, that piety has always appeared the mo&s;t <HI>durable,</HI> which is mo&s;t founded on rea&s;on and con|viction; and, though I abhor the cold rock of &s;ceptici&s;m, yet there is, likewi&s;e, &s;ome danger, that a well di&s;po&s;ed woman, who&s;e &s;en&s;ibility is, as yet &s;tronger than her judgment, may founder on the oppo&s;ite quick&s;ands of enthu&s;ia&s;m, or of &s;uper&s;tition.</P>
<P>Still I would rather &s;ee a &s;mall mixture of <HI>credu|lity,</HI> than <HI>unbelief;</HI> but there is an happy medium betwixt the extremes; and it is very ob&s;ervable, that tho&s;e people, who, in &s;ome peculiar period of their lives, or under &s;ome <HI>di&s;tre&s;&s;ing</HI> circum&s;tan|ces, have &s;eemed to &s;oar upon the wings of pious

<P>There are moments in the moral life, when fancy plucks the reins out of the hands of rea&s;on; and though &s;he drives at intervals with a furious rapidity, yet nature &s;oon becomes exhau&s;ted with the violence, and cannot mount &s;ome intervening hills without &s;topping for refre&s;hment. Sometimes &s;he has been known to &s;it down in a li&s;tle&s;s lan|guor, and wholly to abandon the journey in de|&s;pair.</P>
<P>We are not, in this &s;tate, formed for <HI>extremes.</HI> Any of the pa&s;&s;ions, too <HI>violently</HI> exerci&s;ed, would wear out an imperfect frame. True piety is not the blazing <HI>meteor</HI> of an hour, fiery in its a&s;pect, and engaging the a&s;toni&s;hment of a gazing multi|tude, but that &s;ofter and &s;ettled light of the fir|mament, <Q>which &s;hineth more and more, unto the perfect day.</Q></P>

It is contrary to all my ideas of civil|ization, politene&s;s, fortitude, and even common gen|ero&s;ity, and militates again&s;t every thing, that &s;hould con&s;titute the real character of a gentleman, or a chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>No man lives, without <HI>foibles</HI> or <HI>particularities;</HI> and, if in&s;tead of making allowance for tho&s;e of others, in order to receive an indulgence for our own, we ungenerou&s;ly expo&s;e them to ridicule or contempt, the con&s;equence, in &s;ociety, mu&s;t be a general coldne&s;s, di&s;gu&s;t, rancour, ho&s;tility, and <HI>uncea&s;ing</HI> per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>No per&s;on can be &s;o circum&s;pect, particularly, in a public character, as to avoid creating, though without intending it, a number of little piques and enemies again&s;t him&s;elf; &s;ometimes even by an inflexible di&s;charge of <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> duties; and if his character mu&s;t be taken from the colourings of tho&s;e, whom he has thus innocently, perhaps <HI>laudably,</HI> offended, all his virtues will be thrown into the back ground, and his foibles aggravated with the utmo&s;t virulence of malice and re&s;entment. Prejudice <HI>again&s;t,</HI> may render the mo&s;t amiable per&s;on <HI>ridiculous,</HI> by concealing the <HI>great,</HI> and bringing forward the little; and prejudice <HI>for,</HI> may give &s;ome &s;ort of merit to the mo&s;t de&s;picable and
<PB N="69" REF="023176_0220_0FBDDFAD684BCBC0">abandoned. Such a liberty of the pre&s;s is down|right <HI>licentiou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> and every friend to order and virtue, if he will con&s;ult his own feelings, will not he&s;itate to pronounce, that, of all <HI>&s;acred</HI> things, character is <HI>mo&s;t</HI> &s;o.</P>
<P>If a per&s;on, however great, had u&s;ed me <HI>ungene|rou&s;ly,</HI> I would certainly expo&s;e him to public cen|&s;ure, and drag him before the formidable tribunal of my country. I would appeal from the oppre&s;&s;|ion of any <HI>individual,</HI> to the <HI>general</HI> equity and can|dour of mankind. <HI>This,</HI> I &s;hould conceive, not merely an act of ju&s;tice to <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> but likewi&s;e to the world. It is a <HI>common</HI> intere&s;t, that <HI>tyrants,</HI> however high in rank, or in &s;elf-e&s;timation, &s;hould meet with their de&s;erved infamy and contempt.&mdash; Such a di&s;play of <HI>true</HI> &s;pirit wonderfully &s;tops the progre&s;s of de&s;poti&s;m, and teaches in&s;olence the hard le&s;&s;on of moderation. But, then, it &s;hould be done in the mo&s;t open manner. I would can|didly &s;ub&s;cribe my name to the charges, I adduo|ed; and, whil&s;t I &s;hewed the world that I feared not the per&s;on of man, I would convince mine ad|ver&s;ary, that I was far above the meanne&s;s of tak|ing an <HI>unmanly</HI> or ungenerous revenge.</P>
<P>This hone&s;t courage was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in an eminent degree, by the late Dr. John&s;on. Nothing has plea&s;ed me more in the hi&s;tory of his life, than his troly magnanimous conduct to the late earl of Che&s;terfield. When he undertook to compo&s;e his <HI>elaborate</HI> dictionary, he &s;olicited the favour of in|&s;cribing it to his Lord&s;hip, who was then if I mi&s;|take not Secretary of State. Flattered with <HI>appear|ing</HI> the patron of literature, Che&s;terfield accepted the honour of the dedication, and an <HI>honour</HI> it would have been to any nobleman in the world.&mdash;
<PB N="70" REF="023176_0221_0FBDDFAEE6B4E3C8">In the progre&s;s of this long and tedious work, he received no very &s;olid marks of encouragement from his patron, and &s;u&s;pected on the whole, that the courtly peer meant only to <HI>amu&s;e</HI> him.</P>
<P>John&s;on had too much &s;pirit either to brook the idea of neglect, the chicanery of a mini&s;ter, the violation of a promi&s;e, or the &s;ervility of an abject dependence. He was not likely to be daz|zled with the glitter of a coronet, or intimidated with the ceremonious pageantry of office. He, therefore, wrote a formal letter to the nobleman, upbraiding him with in&s;incerity, di&s;claiming his protection, and a&s;&s;uring him, that he did not want, and never would receive, any of his favours.&mdash; The con&s;equence of this <HI>fracas</HI> was, that he after|wards &s;tung Che&s;terfield with &s;uch bitter invec|tives, and &s;o many pointed &s;trokes of raillery and &s;atire, as made him heartily repent of having rou&s;ed his re&s;entment, and de&s;irous, at any rate, of a reconciliation. John&s;on, however, per&s;i&s;ted in his antipathy, and never afterwards, I believe wrote a dedication.</P>
<P>If Che&s;terfield intended only to dally with the author of this dictionary, he &s;hould certainly have con&s;idered, that men of great abilities have too much penetration not to &s;ee through any flim&s;y di&s;gui&s;es of a mini&s;ter; too much irritability not to be exa&s;perated with hypocri&s;y or artifice, and too <HI>lofty</HI> a reliance on their own <HI>native</HI> powers to be afraid of any peer or monarch in the world.</P>
<P>John&s;on, it is true, had not then attained all his eminence and di&s;tinction. He was comparatively, but <HI>ri&s;ing</HI> into notice. The day that &s;hould an|nounce him the hero of literature, was only in its dawn. But contra&s;ted with his <HI>&s;olid</HI> merit, what
<PB N="71" REF="023176_0222_0FBDDFB06882DD68">is the paltry tin&s;el of &s;tation, from which &s;ome peo|ple immediately become &s;o &s;upercilious and for|bidding?</P>
<P>If Che&s;terfield did not think the author of the Rambler, greater than him&s;elf; if from the foot alone, he could not progno&s;ticate the future &s;trength and immen&s;e proportions of this literary <HI>Hercules,</HI> he had not a &s;ingle grain of that &s;hrewd|ne&s;s or di&s;cernment for which he has been &s;o much complimented by the world.</P>
<P>Such is <HI>my</HI> idea of the true and genuine &s;pirit, which &s;hould characterize a &s;cholar and a gentle|man. It is not a &s;tiletto, &s;tabbing in the dark, but a challenge to a fair and generous on&s;et, in which your antagoni&s;t has the opportunity of &s;elf-de|fence, and of managing all his weapons to ad|vantage.</P>

<P>THE beauty of the lady you allude to, was her misfortune. It in&s;pired her with an immoderate vanity, and that vanity paved the way to her ruin. It dug the grave, in which her peace and character are now intombed.</P>
<P>And after all, my dear girl, what <HI>is</HI> this beauty? It is a little clay, ca&s;t in an elegant mould, and by the hand of an exqui&s;ite arti&s;t, fa&s;hioned into &s;ome|thing of &s;ymmetry and order. It is a &s;mall mix|ture, in the cheek of ro&s;es and carnations.</P>
<P>But who needs to be informed that clay is very peri&s;hable, that ro&s;es and carnations are but for <HI>&s;ummer moments,</HI> and that afterwards there comes a
<PB N="72" REF="023176_0223_0FBDDFB1E68ED1B0">long autumn of &s;ickne&s;s, or a &s;till more dreaty winter of infirmity and old age.</P>
<P>How tran&s;ient are the power and duration of beauty! How very &s;light an accident or di&s;ea&s;e bla&s;ts it for ever! How fatal is a fever, the &s;mall pox, or a little corroding grief to all its allure|ments! and if they do not peri&s;h &s;ooner, how dreadfully are they ravaged by the hand of time!</P>
<P>Whil&s;t &s;ummer la&s;ts, a few, fluttering in&s;ects light upon its lips, to &s;ip the &s;weets. Some &s;trag|gling birds of pa&s;&s;age chirp upon the neighbouring &s;pray, delighted with a view of the amiable object. The notice is enchanting, and imagination pro|mi&s;es that it &s;hall be <HI>ternal.</HI> But the fir&s;t &s;torm, that comes, alas! the&s;e feathered &s;ong&s;ters migrate to warmer climates, and a &s;erener &s;ky, leaving all its withered charms to peri&s;h in neglect!</P>
<P>How ridiculous is the girl, who wilfully &s;wal|lows the poi&s;on of flattery for any per&s;onal charms, and, in the height of her intoxication, can be in&s;o|lent or conceited! What woman of &s;pirit &s;hould not a&s;pire to qualities, that are le&s;s <HI>accidental</HI> and le&s;s &s;ubject to change! What woman of reflexion &s;hould not re&s;olve to adorn and cultivate a mind, who&s;e trea&s;ures may be inexhau&s;tible, and who&s;e attractions never die?</P>
<P>I pity every girl, whom nature has gifted with a very pretty face. She &s;eems, by the very act, to have marked her out for trials and temptations, and our &s;trength is not always in proportion to our conflicts.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the unfortunate ladies, I have known, have been celebrated for their beauty. This has gathered all the worthle&s;s of our &s;ex about them;

<P><HI>Richard&s;on's Clari&s;&s;a</HI> has qualities <HI>above</HI> woman, and her &s;orrows plunge the reader into de&s;pair.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Byron is every thing, that is fini&s;hed in a female. We admire her greatly, but we love her more. The <HI>&s;weetne&s;s</HI> of the character &s;wallows up its dignity; in the amiable, we forget the

<P>POOR Loui&s;a, notwith&s;tanding all her good|ne&s;s, is, at pre&s;ent, in the greate&s;t affliction, and for a rea&s;on, which reflects no little honour on her &s;en&s;ibility and virtue.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t received a letter from her father, in|forming me, that Dr. &mdash;, Rector of B&mdash;, and the confidential friend and intimate of their family, is very probable on his death bed. He
<PB N="75" REF="023176_0226_0FBDDFB665C53850">was lately called upon, it &s;eems, to vi&s;it one of his hearers, who was &s;ick with a putrid, &s;ore throat, and fever, and has taken the infection. The phy|&s;icians entertain but &s;lender hopes of his recovery, and Philander<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The father of Loui&s;a.</NOTE> has been admini&s;tering to him that holy &s;acrament, which with prayers and ble&s;&s;ings, he has him&s;elf &s;o often, admini&s;tered to others.&mdash; The whole village is in mourning. All the pea|&s;ants, I am told, appear as &s;heep without a &s;hepherd.</P>
<P>This good man was well acquainted with every per&s;on in his pari&s;h. He thought it his duty, to vi&s;it all his hearers, to inve&s;tigate their <HI>&s;piritual,</HI> as well as temporal wants, and to remove the for|mer whil&s;t he extended a liberal &s;upply to the latter.</P>
<P>The death of &s;uch a per&s;on is more than the lo&s;s of the neare&s;t relatives. A <HI>good</HI> clergyman, in the <HI>country,</HI> unites, in his own per&s;on, all the tender connections.

<P>THE apprehen&s;ions concerning Dr &mdash; were but too well founded. He is, I do believe, in the la&s;t &s;tages of his life. Death is on the point of elo&s;ing his eyes, and opening for him the ju&s;t re|ward of all his labours and his zeal.</P>
<P>I have been with him almo&s;t night and day, ever &s;ince I had the plea&s;ure of writing to you, and have received a &s;tronger le&s;&s;on, than ever, of the vanity of all earthly things, and the &s;upreme dig|nity of virtue.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;olemn &s;cenes wonderfully improve the heart. They &s;trip ambition of its plumage. The world appears a phantom! honours and promotions all a dream!</P>
<P>Though I have been much affected, yet I have been comforted in an equal degree, by his cheer|ful piety, and edifying conver&s;ation. His faith and re&s;ignation ri&s;e &s;uperior to his pains. They are literally big with immortality; and he longs to be di&s;&s;olved and to be with Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Unwearied and exemplary as he has <HI>always</HI> been in the di&s;charge of his pa&s;toral duties he is conti|nually lamenting his want of zeal, vigilance and exertion. The duties of the mini&s;try are, I do be|lieve, beyond human ability: <Q>who, &s;aid St. Paul, is &s;ufficient for the&s;e things?</Q> But when I hear the declarations of this excellent man, and compare, as it is natural, his example with my own, I cannot but be &s;eriou&s;ly alarmed, and
<PB N="77" REF="023176_0228_0FBDDFB964CE5530">&s;ketch out nothing for <HI>my own</HI> la&s;t moments, but remor&s;e and fears.</P>
<P>My good friend and his lady have taken their la&s;t leave. It would have touched <HI>any</HI> heart to have &s;een this interview. I cannot do it ju&s;tice by <HI>words.</HI> The pencil of a Raphael could not fully repre&s;ent it. It was all <HI>heart</HI> and &s;oul. Silent looks and <HI>manner</HI> were the principal language, and they &s;poke indeed! Such a woman's brea&s;t pant|ing with grief, upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion, ri&s;es above the powers of de&s;cription.</P>
<P>"O (&s;ays the expiring chri&s;tian, rai&s;ing his languid eyes and endeavouring to u&s;e a tongue, which death had almo&s;t pal&s;ied,) <Q>be as you <HI>have</HI> been, the comforters of my people (for they alas! will feel a <HI>tran&s;ient</HI> void,) and our friend&s;hip, I doubt not, will &s;hortly be renewed in another life. Death can only, for a little time, &s;eparate the&s;e <HI>bodies:</HI> our real <HI>intere&s;ts.</HI> our <HI>&s;ouls</HI> and happine&s;s mu&s;t ever be united.</Q></P>
<P>Loui&s;a is incon&s;olable. "Tears have been her meat day and night;" and her grief is the heavier, as &s;he is not permitted, from motives of <HI>prudence,</HI> to &s;ee the la&s;t &s;truggles of this excellent man, or receive his ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P><Q>Providence, (&s;ays the accompli&s;hed girl,) has <HI>now,</HI> but, <HI>one</HI> heavier &s;troke to inflict, and that is the death of my father, or my mother.

<P>THE conflict is fini&s;hed. The pangs are over. Dr. &mdash; is no more. He is now, I tru&s;t, a ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirit, and knows no longer pain, or &s;or|row or apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>From the natural tenderne&s;s and &s;en&s;ibility of his temper you may wonder that he lived and died unmarried. But it is a &s;ecret known only to his intimate friends that he had formed an attachment, in his early years, which being di&s;appointed by the death of the lady, the delicacy of his mind never <HI>afterwards</HI> admitted of another. His partiality was not of the common fugitive kind. It was a deep and <HI>permanent</HI> impre&s;&s;ion. Having once fondly loved, he attempted to love no more.</P>
<P>As his private fortune was comfortable, and his preferment, good, you will conclude, perhaps,
<PB N="79" REF="023176_0230_0FBDDFBC65CD1BD8">that he died very rich. But this is not the ca&s;e. The poor were con&s;tantly fed from his table, as well as edified by his coun&s;els. He was a living example of the charity he recommended, and a witne&s;s of the truth, "that it is more ble&s;&s;ed to give than to receive."</P>
<P>Though remarkable for his prudence, as well as pa&s;toral zeal, yet having but a few, di&s;tant rela|tives, who were all in very ea&s;y circum&s;tances, he has only left to each, an equal legacy of &pound;100 and the remainder of the &pound;5000, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, is entirely devoted to charitable u&s;es.</P>
<P>To each of his three &s;ervants, he has bequeathed an annual &s;tipend of &pound;20, on this ea&s;y condition, however, that they be never ab&s;ent, when in <HI>health,</HI> from the church or &s;acrament; that they always appear neat and decent, and that they lay up, from their pittance, one &s;ingle &s;ix pence on the fir&s;t day of every week, to be expended in <HI>charity.</HI> The re&s;idue of his fortune is to be employed, part|ly in e&s;tabli&s;ing a fund for the di&s;tribution of re|ligious books and tracts, among&s;t the poor and ig|norant of his pari&s;h, at the di&s;cretion of the min|i&s;ter; and, partly, for the clothing and educating a &s;pecific number of boys and girls in a &s;chool, which he had founded, and very principally &s;up|ported in his life-time.</P>
<P>My friend and I are joint executors. To him he has demi&s;ed a con&s;iderable part of his excellent library; to me a number of books, which are at once a monument of his ta&s;te and friend&s;hip; to Mrs.&mdash;, all the elegant furniture of his draw|ing room, and to his &s;weet, and, as he &s;tyles her, ever dear Loui&s;a, his pictures, &s;tatues, bu&s;ts and p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">refactions, be&s;ide a number of <HI>devotional</HI> authors,
<PB N="80" REF="023176_0231_0FBDDFBDE678C140">gilt and fini&s;hed with an elegance and beauty, which expre&s;s the opinion he had ju&s;tly conceived of her cultivated mind.</P>
<P>When the poor girl was informed of this legacy, &s;he bur&s;t into a flood of tears, nor could all the tender offices of her friends con&s;ole her. <Q>How in&s;upportable (&s;aid &s;he,) is this man's genero|&s;ity! with what a cruel kindne&s;s does he haunt me after death! Had it not been for this perhaps, I &s;hould more ea&s;ily have learned the <HI>hard</HI> le&s;&s;on of re&s;ignation. But this tenderne&s;s renews my grief, and tears open afre&s;h the wounds, which I have been &s;ummoning all my fortitude to clo&s;e. But why mu&s;t I not &s;ee this good man on his death-bed, to te&s;tify, for the la&s;t time, the warmth of my gratitude, and the &s;incerity of my e&s;teem?</Q></P>
<P><Q>But tell me, ye, who were admitted to his pre&s;ence, what &s;aid he of me, in his late&s;t mo|ments? Did he, then, at all recollect his Loui|&s;a? Did he even glance at &s;o humble a name?

<P>And, now, what is your opinion of Loui&s;a? What think you of <HI>&s;uch</HI> a clergyman? What are dignities, compared with &s;uch virtues? What are kingdoms, contra&s;ted with &s;uch joys?

I will give you a very hand&s;ome eulogy on this art, in the words of a great writer, Quintilian. <Q>Picture (&s;ays he,) a &s;ilent and uniform addre&s;s, yet penetrates &s;o deeply into our inmo&s;t affecti|ons, that it &s;eems often to exceed even the pow|ers of eloquence. Its effects, indeed, are &s;ome|times amazing. It is &s;aid, that Alexander trem|bled and grew pale, on &s;eeing a picture of Pala|medes, betrayed to death by his friends; it bringing to his mind a &s;tinging remembrance of his treatment of Ari&s;tonicus. Portia could bear, with an un&s;haken con&s;tancy, her la&s;t &s;e|paration from Brutus; but when &s;he &s;aw, &s;ome hours after a picture of the parting of Hector and Andromache, &s;he bur&s;t into a flood of tears. Full as &s;eemed her &s;orrow, the painter &s;ugge&s;ted new ideas of grief, or impre&s;&s;ed more &s;trongly her <HI>own.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Your que&s;tion concerning the &s;uperiority of the ancients or moderns in this particular, is very ea&s;i|ly an&s;wered. In mo&s;t, if not <HI>all</HI> the fine arts, in|deed, the former, according to my apprehen&s;ion, are ab&s;olutely unrivalled. By the ancients, I <HI>now</HI> mean, particularly the Greeks.</P>
<P>Whether it was owing to the particular nature and freedom of their government&mdash;to the &s;uperior honours 
<PB N="82" REF="023176_0233_0FBDDFC0E73AEC48">and encouragement that were lavi&s;hed on genius and the arts in this more early period of &s;o|ciety&mdash;whether to any particular &s;uperiority of organization in the natives of this country&mdash;whe|ther to its beautiful &s;cenery or the allegorical na|ture of a religion, which &s;o much called painting, poetry and &s;culpture into exerci&s;e&mdash;or whether we may not a&s;cribe it to an happy <HI>combination</HI> of all the&s;e &s;eparate cau&s;es, it is certain, that their ta&s;te and imaginaton were exqui&s;ite beyond tho&s;e of any other people, and produced a degree of ex|cellence in their arti&s;ts, that we cannot find in any other age or country of the world.</P>
<P>Raphael, whom all Europe has &s;o much prai&s;ed, excelled only, as he formed him&s;elf upon the model of the <HI>Greeks.</HI> The Italians (ob&s;erves an able judge,) may excel in colouring; but compo|&s;ition, drawing, the art of grouping, attitude, movement, expre&s;&s;ion, contra&s;t, drapery, charac|ter and grace&mdash;all the&s;e, this great genius con|fe&s;&s;edly borrowed from the ancient &s;tatues and bas reliefs.</P>
<P>Palladio is the fir&s;t of architects, Michael An|gelo, Fiammingo, Algardi, the mo&s;t celebrated &s;culptors, only for the &s;ame rea&s;on; they &s;tudied the Greeks. Yet Angelo was the bolde&s;t genius, that Italy ever had. "It was he, who conceived the idea of placing the pantheon in the air, and con&s;tructed the dome of St. Peter's on the &s;ame dimen&s;ions."</P>
<P>Nor in <HI>letters</HI> were the Greeks le&s;s the model of perfection. To emulate their be&s;t writers has been the ambition of every &s;ucceeding age. And ex|cellence has been attained only in proportion to the &s;ucce&s;sfulne&s;s of this imitation.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="023176_0234_0FBDDFC26B01CFB8">
The fir&s;t and mo&s;t complete <HI>poem</HI> in the world, is Grecian&mdash;the Iliad of Homer. It unites all the &s;eparate a&s;toni&s;hing excellencies of this mo&s;t difficult &s;pecies of compo&s;ition; the maje&s;tic, the terrible, the pathetic and the &s;ublime. Natural|i&s;ts, philo&s;ophers, painters, poets, orators, metaphy|&s;icians have all, in various methods, dug from this mine, and &s;till left it full of inexhau&s;tible trea&s;ures. It is proverbially known how much the great Ro|man orator &s;tudied Homer, and indeed how much he has been prai&s;ed by the whole world. I will give you a few te&s;timonies in his favour.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t critic, that ever exi&s;ted, is Longinus, who wrote a treati&s;e on the &s;ublime: This is <HI>his</HI> opinion of the Iliad:</P>
<P><Q>Tho&s;e only, who have &s;ublime and &s;olid thoughts, can make elevated di&s;cour&s;es and, in this part, Homer chiefly excels, who&s;e thoughts are all &s;ublime, as may be &s;een in the de&s;cripti|on of the godde&s;s, Di&s;cord, who has, &s;ays he, her head in the &s;kies, and her feet upon the earth; for it may be &s;aid, that that grandeur which he gives her, is le&s;s the mea&s;ure of Di&s;|cord, than of the capacity and elevation of Homer's genius.</Q></P>
<BIBL><HI>Treati&s;e on the Sublime.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Again in another place: <Q>To Homer, that is, to him, who had received the applau&s;es of the whole world.</Q></P>
<P>And, in a third pa&s;&s;age, mentioning the num|ber of men, who had endeavoured to imitate Ho|mer, he ob&s;erves:</P>
<P><Q>Plato, however, is he, who has imitated him mo&s;t, for he has drawn from this poet, as
<PB N="84" REF="023176_0235_0FBDDFC3E62D3D38">from a living &s;pring, from which he has turned an infinite number of rivulets.</Q></P>
<P>Another excellent judge is Horace who bears to this prince of poets, this honourable te&s;timony, that he taught <HI>philo&s;ophy</HI> better than many, who were philo&s;ophers by <HI>profe&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>A third critic of no incon&s;iderable talents has the&s;e lines in his favour:</P>
<Q><L>On diroit que pour plaire in&s;truit par la nature</L>
<L>Homere ait &aacute; Venus derob&eacute; &s;a ceinture;</L>

<L>Tout ce qu'il a touch&ecirc; &s;e convertit en or.</L></Q>
<P>Pope's opinion of him it is not nece&s;&s;ary to re|cite; and the Jeru&s;alem Delivered of a great au|thor, is, from beginning to end, a <HI>tacit</HI> comment on, for it is an attempt to imitate, his greatne&s;s.</P>
<P>Let me not omit the compliment of Dante, for it is worth recording:</P>
<Q><L>Quegli &egrave; Omero poeta &s;ovrano</L>
<L>Signor dell'alti&s;&s;imo canto</L>
<L>Che &s;ovra gli altri, come Aquila, vola.</L></Q>
<P>The be&s;t writers of the Augu&s;tan age of Rome formed them&s;elves con&s;iderably on <HI>Grecian</HI> models. The mo&s;t perfect authors in England, France and Italy; Addi&s;on, Pope. Racine, Boileau, Ta&s;&s;o and Meta&s;ta&s;io took the &s;ame method to arrive at perfection; and one might challenge the whole world to produce any other poem, like the Iliad; an orator, equal to Demo&s;thenes; &s;uch a fini&s;hed tragedy as the Oedipus of Sophocles; any figure in marble, like the Belvedere Apollo; &s;uch fine and light drapery, as that of the Flora, or a fe|male beauty, as perfect as the Venus of Medici.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="023176_0236_0FBDDFC564C20CA8">
The great Monte&s;quieu was, for &s;ome time, in Italy, and, as you may &s;uppo&s;e, no &s;uperficial ob|&s;erver. This was his deci&s;ion concerning the Greeks. <Q>Ta&s;te and the arts have been carried by them to &s;uch an height, that to think to &s;ur|pa&s;s, will be always not to know them.</Q></P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXI.</HEAD>
<P>THE Italians excel in &s;ome of the fine arts. In <HI>mu&s;ic,</HI> perhaps, they may ju&s;tly claim a deci&s;ive &s;uperiority. Of <HI>colouring</HI> they are great ma&s;ters. Among&s;t many other di&s;tingui&s;hed painters, they boa&s;t a Corregio. No one could do more honour
<PB N="86" REF="023176_0237_0FBDDFC6E4B994B0">to any nation. He is the very pupil of nature, and has wonderfully united elegance and ea&s;e. If Raphael &s;hines in the <HI>maje&s;tic,</HI> he has all the <HI>&s;oft</HI> and <HI>amiable</HI> graces.</P>
<P>In <HI>land&s;cape</HI> painting, Italy is unrivalled. Tho&s;e of Claude Lorrain are &s;uperior to any other ma&s;|ter's. Perhaps one rea&s;on is, the beauty of the &s;cenes, from which they are taken. Viewed col|lectively, there is not, I &s;hould conceive, a more delightful and enchanting country. It &s;eems to mingle all the &s;oft and milder beauties of climate, with the magnificent and tremendous; gentle hills, rich vallies, fruitful exten&s;ive vineyards, with craggy, rugged precipices, with the portentous a&s;pect and caverns of Aetna; the bay of Naples, with the formidable grandeur and thunder of Ve|&s;uvio.</P>
<P>No place has been the &s;cene of &s;o many memo|rable events, or given birth to &s;uch a number of di&s;tingui&s;hed men. Tu&s;cany produced Dante, Petrarch, and Michael Angelo; Livy was born at Padua; Titian at Venice, and Ario&s;to at Ferrara. Urbino is ju&s;tly proud of Raphael, and Parma of Corregio. Rome claims Tacitus and Lucretius, Arpinum, Cicero, and Venu&s;ium, Horace.</P>
<P>If my lei&s;ure and opportunities had been equal to my wi&s;hes, I &s;hould have gloried in traver&s;ing this country. Every &s;tep would have had a pecu|liar intere&s;t, and every &s;cene revived tho&s;e glowing de&s;criptions of a Virgil or an Horace, that fa&s;ci|nated my <HI>earlie&s;t</HI> years. When a per&s;on has been &s;ome time, in the world, whatever recalls the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> days of life, admini&s;ters the &s;weete&s;t plea&s;ure. It is the picture of innocence and tranquility, whil&s;t our maturer age is often a bu&s;tle or a &s;torm.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="023176_0238_0FBDDFC8685BDD08">
In ancient Rome, it was a confe&s;&s;ed maxim, that true politene&s;s and ta&s;te were derived from the Grecians. And the Italian arti&s;ts &s;cill owe much of their excellence to the&s;e primitive ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>The <HI>literary</HI> ta&s;te of the Italians is very excepti|onable. It is a fal&s;e &s;ublime, a fictitious glitter, and a barren abundance, and has lo&s;t the true Attic &s;alt of nature, of truth and &s;implicity. Hence they are &s;aid to prefer the Gothic works of Dante, the ab&s;urdities of Ario&s;to, the extravagancies of Marini, and the tin&s;el puerilities of Ta&s;&s;o, to the tender and impa&s;&s;ioned de&s;criptions of Meta&s;ta&s;io.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> &s;eem to think them&s;elves exclu&s;ive proprietors of every thing, that goes under the denomination of ta&s;te. And, indeed, they are u|niver&s;ally e&s;teemed a poli&s;hed, ea&s;y, graceful and &s;educing people. Few of their writers, however, have much of the <HI>profound,</HI> or that bids fair for <HI>duration.</HI> Of <HI>all</HI> people, they &s;eem <HI>lea&s;t</HI> to have &s;tudied the cla&s;&s;ics. Their &s;tile, in general, wants energy and compactne&s;s. In <HI>many</HI> words they communicate but <HI>few</HI> ideas, and their imagination is permitted to run <HI>wild</HI> without hearkening to the &s;ober dictates of judgment. Though trees in blo&s;&s;om are a beautiful object, yet the &s;olid <HI>ad|vantage</HI> lies in their <HI>fruit.</HI> I could except many great names from this, <HI>apparently,</HI> inviduous cen|&s;ure. One, particularly, I will mention&mdash;that is Monte&s;quieu. This man will do them honour with all other nations, and the mo&s;t di&s;tant po|&s;terity. His <HI>E&s;prit de Loix</HI> is, indeed, a mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing performance. It unites the depth, the phlegm and patience of &s;ome other countries, with the vivacity of that, in which it &s;prung.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="023176_0239_0FBDDFC9E61F1FF0">
I do not think that England is, by any means, either from climate, or other fo&s;tering circum&s;tan|&s;tances, the <HI>natural</HI> &s;oil of the <HI>fine arts.</HI> The hot bed of riches it is true, has rai&s;ed a few <HI>exotics,</HI> in <HI>this</HI> way to a &s;uperior <HI>flavour;</HI> and public encour|agement called forth many virtuo&s;os from other countries. But in fact, we are too much engaged with trade and politics to cultivate, in any extra|ordinary degree, the <HI>finer</HI> emotions. Commer|cial habits, manufactures, and the love of money, wherever they prevail, will always be the grave of <HI>virt&ugrave;</HI> and of ta&s;te. In point of <HI>polite</HI> learning this kingdom has, long &s;ince, according to my ap|prehen&s;ion, been at its zenith. The &s;un of its Au|gu&s;tan age appears to be &s;et. But for <HI>profound</HI> knowledge and genius, no nation, perhaps in the known world <HI>has</HI> been more di&s;tingui&s;hed.&mdash; Shake&s;peare, Milton, Locke, Sir I&s;aac Newton! what other country can produce &s;uch a group?&mdash; Nor &s;hall we want models of the mo&s;t graceful in <HI>writing,</HI> whil&s;t we can read the works of Addi&s;on, many papers in the World, the Letters of Lady Wortley Montague, or tho&s;e of Che&s;terfield.</P>
<P>I do not mean to deny, but that <HI>general &s;cience</HI> is more cultivated among the moderns, than it ever was by the ancients, and, in the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> age, more than at any former period whatever. Nat|ural philo&s;ophy in all its branches, chemi&s;try, mathematics, hi&s;tory, politics, juri&s;prudence, and the mechanical arts have arrived to a wonderful degree of perfection, and are daily receiving fre&s;h acce&s;&s;ions of improvement. But I mu&s;t &s;till a&s;&s;ert, that polite learning &s;eems to have flouri&s;hed mo&s;t in the days of Swift, Pope and Addi&s;on. What can be the rea&s;on? Is it that being <HI>then</HI> more new,
<PB N="89" REF="023176_0240_0FBDDFCB67885898">as having but ju&s;t emerged from the darkne&s;s of the times, it was treated with that &s;uperior re&s;pect and deference, we extend to a &s;tranger? Is there a greater <HI>dearth</HI> of real genius? <HI>That</HI> we cannot &s;uppo&s;e, if we give our&s;elves only lei&s;ure to con&s;i|der the many exalted characters, which Britain boa&s;ts. The ca&s;e, I think, is clear, that a mo&s;t extended commerce has deba&s;ed our feelings and vitiated our ta&s;te; that the grand, <HI>political</HI> intere&s;ts of the nation, as it is <HI>now</HI> circum&s;tanced, require a mo&s;t unremitting attention; that the high road to honours and emoluments chiefly lying through the bar or &s;enate, the greate&s;t talents in the king|dom are turned into the&s;e channels. Men rather chu&s;e t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> wrangle and <HI>debate</HI> them&s;elves into afflu|ence and titles, than &s;tarve on the mere, <HI>&s;hadowy</HI> fame of an elegant production.</P>
<P>Wherever there is hope of patronage, genius &s;prings of cour&s;e; and though his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty has always been a liberal encourager of polite knowledge, yet nothing can effectually counteract the wide, and mo&s;t unlimited agency of this <HI>nati|onal</HI> &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Many writers, in our <HI>Augu&s;tan</HI> age, arrived by their labours merely, not only to con&s;iderable af|fluence, but to high di&s;tinctions. They were ca|re&s;&s;ed and honoured in the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable circles. To reward and patronize talents, was a glory and a pride.

<P>YOUR knowledge of the Italian language is much &s;uperior to my own. The little that I <HI>have,</HI> was acquired merely to read a few productions of their be&s;t authors, and be able to form &s;ome <HI>com|parative</HI> idea of their merits or defects.</P>
<P>I am far from denying to this people the prai&s;e of great genius. But I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, that it is not properly cultivated, and the rea&s;on, perhaps, may be, that, in <HI>modern</HI> Italy, learning meets but with little encouragement.</P>
<P>The bad ta&s;te of the Italians in <HI>poetry,</HI> is obvious from many in&s;tances. Dante, in <HI>their</HI> e&s;timation, is &s;uperior to <HI>all</HI> men; and Ario&s;to, whom they con&s;ider as much beneath him, they exalt far above Homer him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Dante had, doubtle&s;s, wonderful abilities. He ri&s;es in many in&s;tances, to the &s;ublime; and, for the times, in which he lived, may ju&s;tly be con|&s;idered as a literary <HI>prodigy.</HI> But his work, on the whole, is but a <HI>gothic</HI> ma&s;s of various kinds of knowledge &s;trangely heaped together without ar|rangement, de&s;ign, or per&s;picuity. To compare
<PB N="91" REF="023176_0242_0FBDDFCE6715D048"><HI>him</HI> with the author of the <HI>Iliad,</HI> is to betray a total want of all the principles of enlightened critici&s;m.</P>
<P>Ario&s;to &s;hines in narrative. He tells a &s;tory with gracefulne&s;s and ea&s;e. Some of his de&s;crip|tions are particularly &s;plendid; and his Orlando Furio&s;o is a lively, and wonderfully various pro|duction. But how frequently does he fall into ridiculous ab&s;urdities, where he entirely lo&s;es &s;ight of nature and of truth, forgetting that excel|lent rule of a judicious critic:</P>

<P>Ta&s;&s;o's <HI>Geru&s;alemme Liberata</HI> has, indi&s;putably, great merit.

<P>No Italian writer <HI>intere&s;ts</HI> &s;o much, or has &s;o nicely developed the human heart, as <HI>Meta&s;ta&s;ic.</HI> He had great advantages by being introduced, at an early period of his life, into the family of the celebrated Gravina, and there learning to explode the fal&s;e ta&s;te of his country.

<P>IF I was called upon to write the hi&s;tory of a <HI>woman</HI>'s trials and &s;orrows, I would date it from the moment when nature has pronounced her <HI>mar|riageble,</HI> and &s;he feels that innocent de&s;ire of a&s;&s;o|ciating with the other &s;ex, which needs not a blu&s;h. If I had a girl of my own, at this <HI>critical</HI> age, I &s;hould be full of the keene&s;t apprehen&s;ions for her &s;afety; and, like the great poet, when the tempt|er was bent on &s;educing our fir&s;t parents from their innocence and happine&s;s, I &s;hould invoke the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance
<PB N="94" REF="023176_0245_0FBDDFD2E59B5D78">of &s;ome guardian angel, to conduct her through the &s;lippery and dangerous paths.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t remember the pa&s;&s;age; <Q>O for that warning voice, which he, who heard,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Marriage is, doubtle&s;s, the mo&s;t natural, inno|cent and u&s;eful &s;tate, if you can form it to any tolerable advantage. It bids faire&s;t for that little portion of happine&s;s, which this life admits; and is, in &s;ome degree, a duty which we owe to the world. If entered into from proper motives, it is a &s;ource of the greate&s;t benefits to the <HI>community,</HI> as well as of private comfort to our&s;elves. What are the highe&s;t ble&s;&s;ings, un&s;weetened by &s;ociety? How poignant are many &s;orrows of life, without a friend to alleviate and divide them! How many are the moments, how many are the exigencies, in which we want &s;ympathy, tenderne&s;s, attention! And what is a moping <HI>individual</HI> to the world, compared with the woman who acts in the tender character of a wife, or parent, and, by a religious culture of an offspring, is training up inhabitants for the kingdom of hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en.</P>
<P>A <HI>&s;ingle</HI> woman is, particularly, defencele&s;s. She cannot move beyond the precincts of her hou&s;e without apprehen&s;ions. She cannot go with ea&s;e or &s;afety, into public. She is &s;urrounded with many, real dangers, and fancy conjures up <HI>more</HI> &s;pectres of its own, to di&s;turb her repo&s;e.</P>
<P>As &s;he goes down the <HI>hill</HI> of life, her friends <HI>gradually</HI> drop away from her, like leaves in the autumn, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e her a pining, <HI>&s;olitary</HI> creature. Even <HI>brothers</HI> and <HI>&s;i&s;ters,</HI> when married them&s;elves, lo&s;e their u&s;ual fondne&s;s for <HI>her,</HI> in the ardours of
<PB N="95" REF="023176_0246_0FBDDFD4658A0028">a newly acquired connection; and &s;he wanders through a wide, bu&s;tling world, uncomfortable in her&s;elf, unintere&s;ting to others, <HI>frequently</HI> the &s;port of wanton ridicule, or a proverb of re|proach.</P>
<P><HI>Men</HI> are often too much engro&s;&s;ed with bu&s;i|ne&s;s, ambition, or criminal pur&s;uits to think very &s;eriou&s;ly of this connection; but if they happen to remain <HI>&s;ingle,</HI> their very efforts become their amu&s;ement, and keep them from experiencing that <HI>unquiet</HI> indolence, which, by <HI>enervating</HI> the mind, powerfully awakens imagination and the &s;en&s;es. A <HI>woman</HI> has abundant lei&s;ure to brood over her inquietude, and to nur&s;e the vapours, till they ter|minate in di&s;ea&s;e. She has not &s;o many methods for <HI>di&s;&s;ipating</HI> thought. Her element is her <HI>hou&s;e|hold,</HI> and the management of her children; and till &s;he becomes a <HI>mother,</HI> &s;he has not objects of con&s;equence enough to occupy the mind, and pre|&s;erve it from feeling unplea&s;ant agitations.</P>
<P>I mean not, however, to in&s;inuate, that there is any thing really <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eproachful</HI> in <HI>virginity,</HI> unle&s;s &amp; woman <HI>choo&s;es</HI> to render it &s;uch, by verifying the &s;tigmas, which have been fixed upon it, and <HI>&s;ub|&s;tantiating,</HI> in her <HI>own</HI> practice, the malevolence, envy, &s;candal, curio&s;ity and &s;pleen, which have, &s;o often, <HI>&s;arca&s;tically</HI> been imputed to the <HI>&s;i&s;ter|hood.</HI> It <HI>may</HI> be, and &s;ometimes, <HI>is,</HI> the choice of very amiable women, who would not marry <HI>any,</HI> but the man of their affections, or with whom they had a <HI>rational</HI> pro&s;pect of happine&s;s; who having been by death or di&s;appointment deprived of <HI>one,</HI> had a delicacy, that never admitted the idea of a &s;econd, attachment, or who were not &s;o devoid of principle and ta&s;te, as to be connected
<PB N="96" REF="023176_0247_0FBDDFD5E890C018">with a <HI>di&s;&s;oluted</HI> drunken, or <HI>abandoned</HI> per&s;on, what|ever might be his fortune, or con&s;equence or con|nexions. Women, who act from &s;uch principles, may be expo&s;ed to the <HI>indelicate</HI> &s;coffs of the <HI>licen|tions,</HI> but mu&s;t have the unre&s;erved e&s;teem and veneration of all the &s;en&s;ible and the good.</P>
<P>It &s;hould not, however, be di&s;&s;embled, (for it ari&s;es from natural principles,) that <HI>married</HI> wo|men are generally more plea&s;ing, than &s;uch, as never formed this connection. Their heart is con|tinually refined, &s;oftened and enlarged by the ex|erci&s;e of all the <HI>tender</HI> feelings to an offspring, whil&s;t the weighty concerns of their particular fa|milies rai&s;e them above that <HI>frivilous</HI> in&s;ipidity, which, with <HI>whatever</HI> ju&s;tice, is the proverbial &s;tigma of a &s;ingle &s;tate.</P>
<P>A married woman, likewi&s;e, has bani&s;hed that &s;hy re&s;erve, which <HI>young</HI> ladies <HI>think</HI> them&s;elves, and, indeed, in &s;ome degree, <HI>are</HI> obliged to prac|ti&s;e, but which, nece&s;&s;ary as it may be, conceals many of their lovelie&s;t graces. The &s;ociety, more|over, of a <HI>&s;en&s;ible</HI> man gives, to a female, a richer fund of ideas, a &s;uperior mode of <HI>thinking</HI> and act|ing, agreeably tempers her vivacity with &s;eriou&s;|ne&s;s, and introduces her to many <HI>improving</HI> ac|quaintance, and entertaining circles, from which the <HI>ceremonious coldne&s;s</HI> of a <HI>virgin</HI> &s;tate, mu&s;t have kept her, at an unapproachable di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Be not, however di&s;appointed, if all your mer|it and amiablene&s;s do not &s;ecure to you <HI>&s;uch</HI> a connexion, as your principles and judgment can approve.</P>
<P>The lives of young men are &s;o <HI>undome&s;ticated,</HI> and, indeed, &s;o criminal, that de&s;erving women, in the pre&s;ent age, are far from receiving tho&s;e at|tentions
<PB N="97" REF="023176_0248_0FBDDFD766AB6230">and civilities, to which, on every princi|ple of ju&s;tice and politene&s;s, they are certainly en|titled.</P>
<P>In proportion as the <HI>morals</HI> of men are depraved, marriage will, always, be unfa&s;hionable and rare&punc; and there are thou&s;ands among&s;t us, who have nei|ther knowledge, &s;en&s;e or virtue enough to wi&s;h for all that delicacy of friend&s;hip, &s;prightline&s;s of conver&s;ation or ea&s;e of manners, which only an accompli&s;hed woman can be&s;tow, or for tho&s;e in|nocent <HI>dome&s;tic</HI> enjoyments, which communicate the highe&s;t <HI>flavour</HI> to, and are the grand and ulti|mate end of, an intercour&s;e betwixt the &s;exes.</P>
<P>Pleas of <HI>inability</HI> to <HI>&s;upport</HI> a family, of the <HI>expen|&s;ivene&s;s</HI> of wives, and their propen&s;ity to &s;plendour and di&s;&s;ipation are u&s;ed. I know, by &s;ome to &s;often their mi&s;conduct, and throw a <HI>flim&s;y</HI> veil over their crimes.</P>
<P>This is not a <HI>proper</HI> place for rea&s;oning with <HI>libertines</HI> or rakes. Still, from their arguments, however trifling or fallacious, you may deduce this u&s;eful le&s;&s;on; that an extravagant turn for finery and &s;hew is a great di&s;advantage to every woman; that it is adver&s;e to all her <HI>happie&s;.</HI> pro&s;|pects and prevents not a few from ever addre&s;&s;ing her, who, in reality, might have been the mo&s;t faithful and obliging companions through life. Though immoral per&s;ons make this apology, from very unju&s;tifiable motives, yet many others, in mo|derate circum&s;tances, might advance it with truth; who, though they neither w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> integrity, know|ledge, nor a &s;en&s;ibility to the charms and me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of a woman, would, yet, never think of <HI>degrading</HI> her to a condition, which they conceive to be be|neath her wi&s;hes and her habits.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="023176_0249_0FBDDFD8E517D1B0">
I have long con&s;idered the immoderate expen|&s;ivene&s;s of young ladies, as, by no means, favour|able to their pro&s;pects or happine&s;s, in <HI>any</HI> view. No parent can take a more certain method to make a daughter's life a &s;cene of continual irrita|tation and misfortune, than by thus ridiculou&s;ly training her to high <HI>expectations.</HI> It has been the <HI>gradual</HI> death of many; it has made the exi&s;tence of <HI>others</HI> a burden, heavy to be borne. Nor can there even, in point of real ta&s;te, be a greater <HI>mi&s;|take</HI> in education. <HI>True</HI> dignity con&s;i&s;teth not in tin&s;el or &s;hew. The neare&s;t approach we can make to <HI>&s;uperior</HI> &s;pirits, is to have as <HI>few wants,</HI> as po&s;&s;i|ble, whil&s;t we inhabit this tenement of clay.</P>

<P>IN your <HI>manner</HI> with the &s;ex at large, I could wi&s;h you to avoid the <HI>modern</HI> forwardne&s;s, as well as that <HI>&s;hy re&s;erve,</HI> which throws a damp on all the <HI>innocent</HI> gaieties of life. The fir&s;t bears upon its face, a <HI>ma&s;culine</HI> indelicacy; the other is the ef|fect of downright prudery, ill breeding, or affecta|tion.</P>
<P><HI>Some</HI> women affect a <HI>coldne&s;s</HI> in their deportment, and act, as if they &s;uppo&s;ed that every man, who ap|proaches them, had a de&s;ign on their per&s;on. Alas! how mi&s;erably are they deceived! How ridicul|ous is the vanity which gives birth to &s;uch a con|duct! <HI>Men</HI> are &s;o much engaged in bu&s;ine&s;s, plea&s;ure, and the amu&s;ements of the world, that
<PB N="99" REF="023176_0250_0FBDDFDA6B572F30">the conque&s;t of a <HI>female</HI> heart is often thought <HI>beneath</HI> their <HI>ambition.</HI> At any rate it is <HI>time</HI> enough to be upon your guard, when you really perceive them bent on making <HI>&s;erious</HI> advances.</P>
<P>Many of them will approach you with <HI>flattery.</HI> This, they have been led to think, the only, cur|rent coin, with the generality of females. If it be not very <HI>gro&s;s,</HI> bear it with good humour. Though you may <HI>de&s;pi&s;e,</HI> do not wantonly return, it with contempt. This is the method to make them ene|mies, and put them on avoiding your &s;ociety for ever. You may ea&s;ily be civil, and yet convince them by your looks and manner, that you perfect|ly under&s;tand how to appreciate <HI>indi&s;criminate</HI> complai&s;ance.</P>
<P>Though, by no means, <HI>&s;eriou&s;ly</HI> bent upon <HI>matri|mony,</HI> yet not a few of them, will pay you flatter|ing attentions. <HI>The&s;e,</HI> if you be not cautions, may, very in&s;en&s;ibly, &s;often your heart, and en&s;nare your affections, particularly if they come from men, who&s;e <HI>general</HI> character or manners you e&s;teem. One caution, therefore, permit me to give you, with an <HI>a&s;&s;urance</HI> that it mu&s;t be <HI>religiou&s;|ly</HI> ob&s;erved, as you value either your dignity or repo&s;e&mdash;never to believe any man in <HI>earne&s;t,</HI> till he makes the mo&s;t <HI>pointed</HI> declarations in your favour.</P>
<P><HI>Fa&s;hion</HI> has made it &s;o much a matter of <HI>form</HI> to pay attentions to a woman, and, particularly, if &s;he is &s;mart, witty, beautiful; if &s;he is celebrated for high connections, or accompli&s;hments, or makes a good figure in public, that numbers of men will be <HI>mechanically</HI> led to flutter about you, who, <HI>In fact,</HI> mean only to <HI>amu&s;e</HI> the moment,
<PB N="100" REF="023176_0251_0FBDDFDBE9C3BDF0">or do honour to their own good breeding and politene&s;s.</P>
<P>Believe me, my dear girl, this gay and <HI>lively</HI> &s;ea|&s;on will <HI>&s;oon</HI> be at an <HI>end.</HI> Girls, that dwell on every body's tongue, and &s;port away, in all their gaudy colours, during <HI>&s;ummer</HI> months, like butter|fles, are never heard of in the <HI>winter,</HI> but &s;ink into a <HI>torpid</HI> &s;tate. They do not, however, re&s;emble &s;ome in&s;ects in the very happy, and enviable, pri|vilege of ri&s;ing with <HI>renewed</HI> charms. <HI>Once</HI> for|gotten, they &s;eldom revive, but are <HI>di&s;placed</HI> by <HI>other,</HI> ri&s;ing favourites for ever; and it has often been ob&s;erved, that <HI>tho&s;e</HI> women are mo&s;t rarely thought of for wives, with whom we are the fond|e&s;t of (what is called,) flirting, and of &s;aying a thou&s;and, civil things, without meaning or <HI>de&s;ign.</HI></P>
<P>With men of principle and integrity, you are always &s;ecure. They will religiou&s;ly beware of engaging your affections, without honourable views. But <HI>the&s;e</HI> alas! where <HI>women</HI> are concern|ed, are not &s;o numerous, as might be expected. More breaches of fidelity are ob&s;ervable in this intercour&s;e, than in any other in&s;tance of the mo&s;t trifling importance.</P>
<P>To entertain a <HI>&s;ecret</HI> partiality for a man, with|out knowing it <HI>reciprocal,</HI> is dreadful indeed. If you have addre&s;s and fortitude enough not to be|tray it, and thus expo&s;e your&s;elf to ridicule and cen&s;ure, (and yet what prudence is <HI>always</HI> equal to the ta&s;k?) it will co&s;t you infinite grief, anxiety and vexation; and a victory over your&s;elf, if you <HI>do</HI> gain it, may be at the expence of your health and con&s;titution. It will, at the &s;ame time, to|tally unfit you for <HI>any other</HI> connection; for who
<PB N="101" REF="023176_0252_0FBDDFDD6A0F97E8">would take the <HI>body,</HI> when another per&s;on is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>&s;oul?</HI></P>
<P>If any man, therefore, can <HI>deliberately</HI> be &s;o cruel, as to vi&s;it you frequently, and &s;hew you every <HI>par|ticularity,</HI> that is only &s;hort of this <HI>grand</HI> explana|tion, never &s;ee him in private; and, if that be in|&s;ufficient, and you <HI>&s;till</HI> feel tender &s;entiments to|wards him, determine to &s;hun his company for ever. It is ea&s;ier, remember, to extingui&s;h a fire, that has but <HI>ju&s;t</HI> broken out, than one, which has been gathering &s;trength and <HI>violence,</HI> from a long <HI>concealment.</HI> Many have neglected this nece&s;&s;ary precaution, and died &s;ilent <HI>martyrs</HI> to their fond|ne&s;s and imprudence. The eye of beauty has <HI>langui&s;hed</HI> in &s;olitude, or been dimmed with a flood of <HI>irremediable</HI> tears. The heart has throbbed with <HI>unconquerable</HI> tumults, which, <HI>gradually</HI> have di&s;|&s;olved an <HI>elegant</HI> frame, that de&s;erved a much <HI>bet|ter</HI> fate. Undi&s;covered by the phy&s;ician, they have baffled all the re&s;ources of his &s;kill; they have rendered ineffectual all the tenderne&s;s of friends, and <HI>death</HI> alone has admini&s;tered that ea&s;e, which neither beauty, friends, not fortune could be&s;tow.</P>
<P>It is po&s;&s;ible, that men may not <HI>always</HI> act from <HI>unamiable</HI> motives, when they carry their atten|tions to a con&s;iderable height, without an <HI>explana|tion.</HI> Their ta&s;te may have privately &s;ingled you out from all the re&s;t of the world, whil&s;t Provi|dence has not propitiou&s;ly rai&s;ed them to circum|&s;tances, which they conceive to be worth your ac|ceptance. They may have a delicacy, a dignity, and independence of mind, which would not ea&s;i|ly brook a <HI>repul&s;e,</HI> or an <HI>inferior</HI> &s;ituation; and they may be, <HI>very honourably,</HI> probing by the&s;e, little methods, the &s;tate of your inclinations.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="023176_0253_0FBDDDD0667225D8">
Of <HI>the&s;e</HI> circum&s;tances you mu&s;t endeavour to judge for your&s;elf, or get &s;ome di&s;cerning, <HI>impar|tial</HI> and more <HI>experienced</HI> friend to be your advi&s;er. If you &s;u&s;pect a per&s;on's conduct to ari&s;e from <HI>&s;uch</HI> motives, you cannot treat him with too much attention. He has paid you, in the mo&s;t delicate and flattering manner, the highe&s;t compliment in the world; and you may depend on his affection being more <HI>&s;incere,</HI> in proportion as it is le&s;s a&s;&s;uming, confident, or <HI>obtru&s;ive.</HI></P>

<PB N="105" REF="023176_0256_0FBDDDD4E84CD560">fortune <HI>merely</HI> without expecting many good or <HI>great</HI> qualities, annexed; or if &s;he &s;eek the latter, &s;he mu&s;t <HI>often</HI> forego all hopes of the former.</P>
<P>If, however, you <HI>&s;hould</HI> have a number of &s;uit|ors, (and, without any compliment, it is not im|po&s;&s;ible,) there are a few, general principles of mo&s;t <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> con&s;equence to regulate your choice.</P>
<P>Fortune, &s;plendour, greatne&s;s are the <HI>alone</HI> cry of mercenary friends. I am not <HI>wholly</HI> of <HI>their</HI> o|pinion. I have &s;een many <HI>wr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tched</HI> in marriage, with all the trappings of gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ne&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. I have known a &s;till greater number happy, who have had only "a dinner of herbs and <HI>love</HI> therewith."</P>
<P>Do not &s;uffer your imagination to be dazzled with <HI>mere</HI> &s;plendour. Never fancy, that <HI>brilliance</HI> is connected with the <HI>mind,</HI> or that the happine&s;s of women, any more than that of men, <Q>con&s;i&s;t|eth in the abundance of the things, that &s;he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;eth.</Q></P>
<P>An <HI>immoderate</HI> fondne&s;s for &s;hew is a great <HI>mis|fortune.</HI> It has led many a poor girl to &s;acrifice her&s;elf to &s;ome illiterate boor, who had nothing but his affluence to recommend him. If &s;uch &s;hould ever be <HI>your</HI> misfortune, I need not mention what would be your feelings. If you was pru|dent enough to avoid all <HI>other</HI> evil con&s;equences, (and many &s;uch, experience records, but delicacy forbears to mention,) you might live to envy the ruddy <HI>un-ambitious</HI> milk-maid, who&s;e toils are &s;weetened by <HI>conjugal attachment,</HI> and who&s;e <HI>bloom|ing</HI> children cheer the <HI>&s;eeming</HI> infelicities of life.</P>
<P>How wretched mu&s;t be a woman, united to a man, whom &s;he does not prefer to every other in the world! What &s;ecret preferences mu&s;t &s;teal into her heart! What unquiet thoughts take
<PB N="106" REF="023176_0257_0FBDDDD667A32010">po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her fancy! And what can men of principle <HI>call</HI> &s;uch an act, but <HI>legal pro&s;titution?</HI></P>
<P>If I was a de&s;potic tyrant, I would inflict this puni&s;hment on the woman I abhorred. She &s;hould entertain a private partiality for <HI>one</HI> per&s;on, and be married to <HI>another.</HI></P>
<P>Never &s;uffer your&s;elf to <HI>think</HI> of a per&s;on, who has not <HI>religious principle.</HI> A good man <HI>alone</HI> is capable of true attachment, fidelity and affection.</P>
<P>Others may feel a <HI>fugitive</HI> pa&s;&s;ion; but on this, alas! you can place no dependence. It may be abated by caprice, &s;upplanted by &s;ome, new fa|vourite, palled by <HI>po&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ion,</HI> and, at <HI>any</HI> rate, will la&s;t no longer, than your <HI>per&s;onal</HI> charms, though tho&s;e charms may have faded by <HI>almo&s;t</HI> laying down your <HI>life</HI> for their &s;ake, by bringing them a beautiful offspring into the world.</P>
<P>During the flattering &s;ea&s;on of <HI>court&s;hip,</HI> men will always endeavour to appear in their <HI>be&s;t</HI> co|lours, and put on all the appearance of <HI>good hu|mour.</HI> But &s;uppo&s;ing this good humour, <HI>real,</HI> it is but a <HI>fluctuating,</HI> un&s;teady principle, depending on the motion of the <HI>blood and &s;pirits.</HI> Nothing, but <HI>religion,</HI> is permanent and <HI>unchangeable,</HI> always con&s;i&s;tent, and always the &s;ame.</P>
<P>A man of <HI>this</HI> ca&s;t will never fail to treat you with <HI>tenderne&s;s</HI> and attention. If little provocati|ons happen, he will &s;often them with gentlene&s;s; if offences come, he will be &s;hielded with patience; if his own temper be unhappy, he will correct it by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of divine grace and of reflection; if misfortunes a&s;&s;ail you, he will bear them with re&s;ignation; in every exigence, he will be a friend; in all your troubles, a &s;tay; in your &s;ickne&s;s, a phy&s;ician; and, when the la&s;t, convul&s;ive moment
<PB N="107" REF="023176_0258_0FBDDDD7E7CD6078">comes, he will leave you with his tears, and with his ble&s;&s;ings. All his <HI>impetuous pa&s;&s;ions</HI> he will &s;up|pre&s;s, from a &s;en&s;e of <HI>duty;</HI> and if ever by an <HI>un|guarded</HI> &s;ally, he &s;hould unfortunately have hurt your feelings, or violated your peace, he will &s;uf|fer more pain from the private recollection, than he can po&s;&s;ibly have inflicted upon you. Ten thou|&s;and cares, anxieties and vexations will mix with the married &s;tate.

<P>Gay and volatile as your &s;pirits may be <HI>before</HI> this union, when, as yet, no <HI>great</HI> trials or mis|fortunes have pre&s;&s;ed on them, yet when you &s;eri|ou&s;ly think of having a family, and calling your|&s;elf mother of a numerous offspring, what po&s;&s;ible comfort can you promi&s;e to your&s;elf without a man of <HI>&s;olid</HI> probity and virtue; one who will be regular in the di&s;charge of all the religious, &s;ocial and dome&s;tic duties; who will faithfully train up your <HI>common</HI> children in the fear of God, and not neglect their many intere&s;ts and wants, and wi&s;hes for the turbid and licentious plea&s;ures of the bottle, gaming, intrigue, the chace, the theatre, or for any other &s;cenes of fa&s;hionable di&s;&s;ipation?</P>
<P>The <HI>next</HI> thing you &s;hould look for is a per&s;on of a <HI>dome&s;tic</HI> ca&s;t. This will, mo&s;t frequently, be found in men of the mo&s;t virtuous hearts and im|proved under&s;tandings. <HI>They</HI> will always have a|bundance of entertainment in private unknown to <HI>vulgar</HI> minds.

Of what con&s;equence are all the good qualities of your hu&s;band, if you mu&s;t be con&s;tantly &s;epa|rated from him?

<P>Men, who&s;e circum&s;tances ab&s;olutely require &s;uch <HI>ab&s;ences,</HI> &s;hould never think of this tender connexion.

<HI>Fortune</HI> &s;urely &s;hould be con&s;idered. It were ab&s;urd to think of love, where there is not &s;ome pro&s;pect of a <HI>decent</HI> provi&s;ion for your probable de&s;cendents.

<P>NEVER think of marrying a <HI>weak</HI> man, in hopes of <HI>governing</HI> him. Silly people are often more peevi&s;h and refractory, than you would &s;up|po&s;e; but if you could even gain your point, and by great addre&s;s and management ri&s;e to the helm, I &s;hould not, by any means, congratulate your &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Women, that a&s;&s;ume the reins, &s;eldom manage them with dignity. Their authority breaks forth in numberle&s;s, petty in&s;tances of tyranny and ca|price, which only render them mi&s;erable in them|&s;elves, as well as unamiable to every beholder.
<PB N="110" REF="023176_0261_0FBDDDDC66ECF740">The quality, which &s;hews a married lady to ad|vantage, is a mode&s;t <HI>&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion</HI> of her under&s;tanding to the man, whom &s;he has not been a&s;hamed to honour with her choice.</P>
<P>I have frequently mentioned Milton, as peculi|arly happy in his ideas of, what con&s;titutes, <HI>conju|gal</HI> propriety. <HI>His</HI> Eve reveres her hu&s;band.

The con&s;equence is, that her character appears lovely to all, and that her a&s;&s;ociate, (as all &s;en&s;ible men <HI>will,</HI>) treats her with <HI>double</HI> tender|ne&s;s, and gives her every mark of a delicate pro|tection:</P>

<L>Smil'd with &s;uperior love.</L>

<P>When men have lived &s;ingle for fifty or &s;ixty years, through a multiplicity of bu&s;ine&s;s, ambiti|ous &s;chemes, or perhaps from more <HI>criminal</HI> cau&s;es, it is no uncommon thing to &s;ee them, all at once, determined on wedlock, and paying their court to &s;ome fine, <HI>blooming</HI> girl of <HI>eighteen.</HI> Indeed, in the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> &s;tate of things, if a woman be not mar|ried <HI>early,</HI> her chance is &s;mall; &s;o violent is the rage for youth and beauty, even in <HI>decrepit beaus!</HI></P>

<P>It is true indeed, that they <HI>do</HI> make you a con|&s;ideration. Your jointure is, generally, in pro|portion to the age of the party. The hundreds are increa&s;ed, as the head is hoary, as the frame is enfeebled, or as wrinkles have contracted the countenance.</P>
<P>Never indulge the thought of marrying in this manner. Wherever there is great <HI>di&s;parity</HI> of years, there cannot be any durable union of hearts.

<P>IN <HI>&s;everal</HI> requi&s;ites to an happy marriage <HI>pro|fe&s;&s;ional</HI> men do not appear, by any means, the mo&s;t eligible.</P>
<P>A great writer has called a phy&s;ician, "the mere play-thing of fortune." However &s;traitened in his circum&s;tances, from having received an ex|pen&s;ive education, he mu&s;t a&s;&s;ume particularly in the <HI>metropolis,</HI> the <HI>appearance</HI> of property merely to gain employment. This <HI>fictitious</HI> grandeur may involve him in difficulties for <HI>many years.</HI>&mdash; His &s;ucce&s;s, from the nature of things, mu&s;t, ge|nerally be <HI>&s;low,</HI> nor will it ever depend &s;o much on his <HI>own</HI> intrin&s;ic merit, as on a fortunate coin|cidence of circum&s;tances, wholly out of his power. If he &s;ucceeds, it will, frequently be <HI>late in life:</HI> and, if he does <HI>not,</HI> he mu&s;t be embarra&s;&s;ed indeed! The children of <HI>&s;uch</HI> a per&s;on <Q>cannot dig, and to beg they are a&s;hamed.</Q> Poverty, &s;harpened by <HI>refinement</HI> and <HI>&s;en&s;ibility,</HI> is afflicting in the extreme!</P>
<P>I do not think the profe&s;&s;ion of the <HI>law,</HI> calcu|lated to render a man, the mo&s;t agreeable compa|nion, in the &s;till, unruffled &s;hades of dome&s;tic life. It calls into continual exerci&s;e, the more <HI>turbid</HI> pa&s;&s;ions; it begets an unplea&s;ant &s;pirit of caviling
<PB N="118" REF="023176_0269_0FBDDDE868B29440">and contradiction, and has le&s;s tendency to nur&s;e the <HI>finer</HI> feelings, than any of the other learned pro|fe&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>By being crowded together, at a <HI>dangerous</HI> age, in the Temple or Lincoln's Inn, young men are apt to contract a licentiou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>morals,</HI> a <HI>laxity</HI> of principles, a &s;pecies of <HI>&s;ceptici&s;m</HI> to palliate their vices, habits of <HI>profanene&s;s,</HI> not a little di&s;&s;ipation, and &s;o far as <HI>your</HI> &s;ex is concerned, very dangerous notions.</P>
<P><HI>Before</HI> marriage, military men and young law|yers are not, in my idea, the &s;afe&s;t acquaintance. The fir&s;t are only bent, without looking any fur|ther, on <HI>dome&s;ticating</HI> them&s;elves, in agreeable families, by every polite attention to <HI>wives and daughters,</HI> and thus amu&s;ing many, lei&s;ure hours, which, in their &s;tate of continual peregrination, would be, otherwi&s;e, in&s;upportable; the latter, in general, &s;cruple not to go great lengths in gallan|try where they have no <HI>&s;erious</HI> intention.</P>
<P>Beware of <HI>&s;uch</HI> &s;ociety; beware of your <HI>heart.</HI> Let not the <HI>unblu&s;hing</HI> front of a barri&s;ter, let not the mere <HI>&s;carlet habit</HI> of a <HI>petit maitre,</HI> who has &s;tudied the windings of the female heart, infinitely more, than tacties, or the art of war, let not a few civil &s;ayings or flattering attentions beguile your imagination, or lay your prudence a&s;leep. I do not think the commerce very &s;afe. If I had a girl of my own, I would not expo&s;e her to &s;o <HI>dangerous</HI> a trial. Many, doubtle&s;s, have come off conquer|ors, but <HI>more</HI> have fallen; and their wounds and tears have made, upon <HI>my</HI> memory, a <HI>la&s;ting</HI> impre&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>Our imagination, however, annexes riches, honours, and even titles to the profe&s;&s;ion of the
<PB N="119" REF="023176_0270_0FBDDDE9E7FCC930">law. But this fancy often <HI>mi&s;leads</HI> us. It is true, that merit has a greater chance in <HI>this,</HI> than in any other profe&s;&s;ion; and it is certain, that a fortunate <HI>few</HI> have attained to very con&s;iderable greatne&s;s. We hear of a Mansfield, a Thurlow, a Kenyon, a Lough borough, a Law, an Er&s;kine, and are dazzled with their names, their &s;ucce&s;s, and hon|ours. But not a word is &s;aid of a thou&s;and others of the fraternity, whom, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of con|&s;iderable talents, fortune never cho&s;e to bring into the public view, or to di&s;tingui&s;h with any of her favours.</P>
<P>But all the&s;e di&s;couragements apart, if a lawyer is <HI>eminent,</HI> he can &s;carcely ever be at <HI>home. Per|petual</HI> cares and bu&s;ine&s;s &s;urround him, and poi&s;on his repo&s;e. His wife and children mu&s;t be <HI>neglect|ed,</HI> and dome&s;tic endearments &s;acrificed to <HI>tumul|tuous</HI> cares. And if he be poor, no poverty can open the door to more chicanery, artifice, or meanne&s;s. At <HI>any</HI> rate, if he be a man of pure morals and religious principles, he has with&s;tood the greate&s;t temptations, that human nature can encounter, and for &s;uperior and heroic virtue, al|mo&s;t de&s;erves a place in the kalendar of &s;aints.</P>
<P>See now a man's partiality to his <HI>own</HI> profe&s;&s;ion; but if it be not founded in rea&s;on, I beg you will reject it.</P>
<P>The office of <HI>clergymen</HI> calls them to a more re|gular and retired life, than that of mo&s;t other men. Their exemption from the bu&s;tle and competitions of the world nur&s;es innocence and &s;en&s;ibility; and if their heart be not <HI>very depraved,</HI> their employ|ments and &s;tudies mu&s;t <HI>&s;often</HI> and re&s;ine it. Their education <HI>&s;hould</HI> have given them the power of en|tertaining,
<PB N="120" REF="023176_0271_0FBDDDEB67074D70">and their calling <HI>&s;uppo&s;es</HI> not only <HI>in|tegrity,</HI> but piety and virtue.</P>
<P>A man of <HI>this</HI> ca&s;t &s;eems particularly calculated not only to <HI>reli&s;h,</HI> but to <HI>enhance</HI> the happine&s;s of a married &s;tate. With hours at command, he has lei&s;ure for the tender offices of friend&s;hip, and the little, <HI>&s;portive</HI> play fulne&s;s of amu&s;ing conver&s;ation. Whil&s;t the woodbine and the ja&s;mine &s;urround his mode&s;t man&s;ion, he dreads no <HI>unpropitous</HI> accident, that &s;hall drag him from his retreat, and can tread, with the faithful partner of his cares, the lonely "&s;ilent haunts, which contemplation loves." He has time for &s;uperintending the in&s;truction of his children, and calling their latent powers into exer|ci&s;e and action. He has opportunity to <HI>realize</HI> the pictures of a Milton, and watch the opening beau|ties of the <HI>paradi&s;e</HI> about him.</P>
<P>Let me, however, be candid, and give you the <HI>po&s;&s;ible</HI> rever&s;e of this piece. The church is in a very unhappy &s;ituation. That education, which renders the eccle&s;ia&s;tic agreeable, often &s;harpens his affliction. That refinement, which captivates the elegant and inexperienced, is the &s;pear, which fetches drops of blood from his heart. Frequent|ly without an <HI>adequate</HI> provi&s;ion, and incapable, by any <HI>&s;ecular</HI> employment, of <HI>improving</HI> his circum|&s;tances, the&s;e <HI>apparent</HI> privileges are only his mis|fortune. The &s;en&s;ibility, which <HI>loves</HI> a woman, doubly mourns her allotment. That tenderne&s;s, which embraces children with &s;uch affection, <HI>&s;hudders</HI> at their pro&s;pects. That independence, which re&s;ults from <HI>liberal</HI> &s;entiments, &s;tartles at the thought of poverty or di&s;tre&s;s; and that peace, which he has found in the abodes of <HI>&s;olitude,</HI> unties him for the <HI>turbulent</HI> agitations of the world.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="023176_0272_0FBDDDECE6B39F90">

<P>In this thoughtle&s;s period, it was the misfortune of this poor girl, with an elegant per&s;on and in|tere&s;ting manner, to fall in his way. She was beautiful; nature had de&s;igned her to plea&s;e; and, if &s;he had been connected with a &s;en&s;ible man, might have been moulded almo&s;t into any thing, that captivates in gracefulne&s;s, or a&s;toni&s;hes in un|der&s;tanding. Her per&s;onal accompli&s;hments in|&s;pired this <HI>petit maitre</HI> with a <HI>fugitive</HI> pa&s;&s;ion; his fortune was competent; di&s;&s;imilarity of ta&s;tes, habits or abilities never was con&s;idered; tender tales were &s;wallowed by her artle&s;s innocence, and his addre&s;&s;es were accepted. After a very &s;hort acquaintance, they are weary of each other. The force of beauty and of pa&s;&s;ion is exhau&s;ted.

<P>For my own part, I had never any idea of &s;uch <HI>early</HI> marriages. If this girl had &s;een the <HI>world,</HI> and a variety of characters, &s;he would not have &s;ubmitted to &s;uch a connection; and if he had

<P>Be&s;ides, what knowledge can a girl, at <HI>her</HI> age, have of the government of a family, or the ar|rangement of <HI>dome&s;tic</HI> concerns?

<HEAD>LETTER XLII.</HEAD>
<P>I WILL now give you the de&s;cription of an <HI>happier</HI> marriage. I have been &s;pending a few days in a family, who have long lived in my e&s;teem, and of whom you have often heard me &s;peak in terms of veneration.</P>
<P>My friend&s;hip with Eugenio, (for &s;o I will call the gentleman,) was formed in tho&s;e early years, when un&s;u&s;picious hearts vibrate to each other, without <HI>ceremony</HI> or re&s;erve. For his lady, &s;o &s;oon as introduced to her, I felt a very <HI>a&s;&s;imilating</HI> par|tiality. We mingled &s;ouls at our fir&s;t meeting, and they have never &s;ince, di&s;corded for a mo|ment.</P>
<P>Eugenio is a man of con&s;iderable learning, and &s;till greater ta&s;te. In every thing that relates to polite knowledge, he has not many &s;uperiors in his age. He is complete ma&s;ter of mu&s;ic, painting and poetry. In architecture, his &s;kill is very con|&s;iderable. In all the phenomena of <HI>natural</HI> hi&s;tory, he is <HI>profe&s;&s;edly,</HI> a connoi&s;&s;eur. The be&s;t writers of Greece and Rome lie con&s;tantly on his table, and amu&s;e many of his lei&s;ure hours.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="023176_0280_0FBDDDF8E8925A40">
Nature has given to his amiable lady, &s;uperior under&s;tanding, which has been improved by a good education, and poli&s;hed by the be&s;t compa|ny in the kingdom. Her mother was one of tho&s;e <HI>uncommon</HI> women, who e&s;teemed it her highe&s;t dig|nity to be <HI>her&s;elf</HI> the nur&s;e and governe&s;s of her children, and taught them to mingle accompli&s;h|ments with knowledge, the <HI>ornamental</HI> graces, with dome&s;tic a&s;&s;iduity.</P>
<P>I will leave <HI>you</HI> to judge, what mu&s;t be the con|&s;equences of &s;uch an union. Think how Eugenio mu&s;t have improved &s;uch a woman! Imagine how this lady mu&s;t have <HI>bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ed</HI> &s;uch a man!</P>
<P>In this family, I am quite in my element. I read, &s;troll, think, or amu&s;e my&s;elf without cen|&s;ure or re&s;traint. I feel a &s;overeign pity for the world of fa&s;hion, and forget that there are any charms in ambition, or any &s;orrows in di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>Their fortune is ju&s;t, what it &s;hould be, for &s;ol|id contentment; too little to in&s;pire a fanta&s;tic emulation with the manners of the <HI>great</HI> world; too large to admit of embarra&s;&s;ment or want. It is, in &s;hort, neither more nor le&s;s, than &pound; 1000 <HI>per annum.</HI> Their family con&s;i&s;ts of two fine boys, and one girl, who is half as amiable, and di&s;tin|gui&s;hed, as Loui&s;a.</P>
<P>Though the fa&s;hionable world would think &s;uch circum&s;tances narrow, yet that economy, which can do <HI>every</HI> thing, has made them very comforta|ble, and their entire complacency in each other's company, rich indeed! They do not di&s;&s;ipate their fortune in expen&s;ive journeys to, or by re&s;i|dence in, the metropolis, and are too happy in
<PB N="130" REF="023176_0281_0FBDDDFA67D2B7A8"><HI>them&s;elves,</HI> to be frequently &s;een in any other pla|ces of di&s;&s;ipation.</P>
<P>This, my dear LUCY, is the happie&s;t of lives.&mdash;After all our ambition, and all our &s;truggles, it is chiefly in the <HI>&s;hade,</HI> that we mu&s;t find contentment. The plea&s;ures <HI>there</HI> are calm; they are plea&s;ures of the <HI>heart.</HI></P>
<P>Their hou&s;e is &s;ituated, at two miles di&s;tance from a con&s;iderable town in the county of &mdash;, upon an eminence, which commands a full view of the city, but has its a&s;pect to tho&s;e woods and &s;hades, with which its owners are infinitely more conver&s;ant, than the more noi&s;y &s;cenes of di&s;&s;ipated life. Elegant, but not &s;uperb, and &s;pacious, tho' plain, it expre&s;&s;es the cultivated ta&s;te of its in|habitants, and the ho&s;pitable kindne&s;s that reigns within.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ure grounds and gardens are in that unornamented &s;tyle, which to me, is always par|ticularly plea&s;ing. Nature has not been wholly &s;acrificed to art, nor wildne&s;s to refinement.&mdash;The wilderne&s;s here and there pre&s;ents you with all its &s;haggy luxuriance, and venerable glooms.&mdash;You rove imbo&s;omed in woods and thickets, and are mingled at a di&s;tance from every prying eye, in tho&s;e &s;ilent haunts of &s;olitude, which poetry has always decked with its charms. Here the hand of the Creator has formed a grotto, and art has not de&s;troyed it; there an alcove, and the pruning knife has not <HI>officiou&s;ly</HI> &s;eparated the intwining branches. In one place, a little fountain murmurs, at its ea&s;e, and nothing has attempted to divert it from its original channel. In another you have tufted beauties, a ca&s;cade, a lawn, an hill or a valley, beautifully inter&s;per&s;ed, exactly as they
<PB N="131" REF="023176_0282_0FBDDDFBE9582310">were formed by the hand of nature, in one of tho&s;e more &s;portive moments, when &s;he wi&s;hed to plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Through the branches of a beautiful hanging wood, which lies before the hou&s;e, you de&s;cry the glittering &s;pire of the pari&s;h church, belonging to the village, of which Eugenio is the patron, and a very exemplary clergyman, the pre&s;ent in|cumbent. It is placed on a <HI>ri&s;ing</HI> ground, as if continually a&s;piring to that heaven, to which its excellent pa&s;tor is always calling the affections of his people. It is built in that gothic &s;tyle, which I always mo&s;t approved in this &s;acred kind of &s;tructure, as be&s;t adapted to in&s;pire the mind with &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and devotion. But it is not from the mere beauty of the place, or the deliciou&s;ne&s;s of its &s;ituation, that its enviable owners derive their happine&s;s. They expect not from &s;hrubs or blo&s;|&s;oms, or the mo&s;t enchanting &s;cenery, the plea|&s;ures of the heart. They know, that the riche&s;t pro&s;pects would &s;oon fade upon the eye, if they did not derive a fre&s;h and lively bloom from princi|ple <HI>within.</HI></P>
<P>In an age of levity, this happy pair are not a|&s;hamed to be thought religious. They are per|&s;uaded, that their ble&s;&s;ings could have no <HI>permanen|cy</HI> or reli&s;h, if un&s;anctified with the &s;mile and pro|tection of heaven. Their hou&s;e is, in fact, a tem|ple, where prayers and prai&s;es, are regularly offer|ed up, every night and morning, to the great Au|thor and pre&s;erver of their lives. Every &s;ervant is required to attend the &s;ervice; and they are all <HI>oc|ca&s;ionally,</HI> in&s;tructed in their duties to God and man. They have likewi&s;e, each a little library of devotional tracts, which have been pre&s;ented to
<PB N="132" REF="023176_0283_0FBDDDFD67A15708">them by their generous &s;uperiors. I had the curi|o&s;ity one day, to examine the title pages, and found them, principally to con&s;i&s;t of the great im|portance of a Religious Life; Beveridge's Private Thought, and Re&s;olutions; Taylor's Holy Living and Dying; Advice again&s;t &s;wearing, drunkenne&s;s, profanne&s;s, &amp;c. in little tracts from the Society, for promoting Chri&s;tian Knowledge; Wil&s;on on the Sacrament; the Chri&s;tian Pattern; Henry's Plea&s;antne&s;s of a Religious Life, &amp;c.</P>
<P>It would delight you to ob&s;erve with what a mixture of love and reverence, the&s;e &s;ervants ap|proach their <HI>real</HI> benefactors. You hear nothing, under <HI>this</HI> roof of tho&s;e feuds and animo&s;ines, which &s;o much embitter the happine&s;s of families. "They live as brethren together in unity." The only contention is, which &s;hall be mo&s;t ardent, a&s;&s;iduous and vigilant in the performance of their duty.</P>
<P>If Maria (Eugenio's lady,) has the <HI>&s;lighte&s;t</HI> in|di&s;po&s;ition, you might read it, without a&s;king a &s;yllable, in the anxious looks and ge&s;tures of all her attendants. She was lately confined with a nervous fever: and it would have a&s;toni&s;hed you to &s;ee the unaffected grief and concern, expre&s;&s;ed in their looks. <Q>What (&s;aid they) will become of our excellent ma&s;ter, if he &s;hould lo&s;e the mo&s;t amiable woman in the world?</Q></P>
<P>The piety of the&s;e people is the more engaging, becau&s;e it is always <HI>cheerful</HI> and &s;erene. It pro|ceeds from <HI>rea&s;en,</HI> and it encourages no <HI>unnatural</HI> authority or gloom. It is mixed with &s;entiment; it is graced with knowledge, and guided by di&s;|cretion, Who wold not pique him&s;elf on a friend|&s;hip
<PB N="133" REF="023176_0284_0FBDDDFEE84C48C0">with &s;uch a family? Who would not wi&s;h that friend&s;hip to be eternal?</P>
<P>When I have added <HI>you</HI> to the group, I fancy my&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of almo&s;t every thing, that mortality can give, and wi&s;h only the continuance of my enjoyments.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLIII.</HEAD>
<P>MANY people of fortune are uncomfortable in marriage, for want of <HI>employment,</HI> or of &s;omething to give an <HI>intere&s;t</HI> to the, otherwi&s;e, <HI>in&s;ipid</HI> uni|formity of the &s;ame excur&s;ions, vi&s;its, company, or entertainments. This is never the ca&s;e within the walls of Eugenio. He is always introducing, from incidents as they ri&s;e, &s;ome u&s;eful and en|tertaining topics of conver&s;ation. A news-paper, books, the garden, flowers, plants, &s;hrubs, hi&s;to|ry, the azure vault of heaven, &s;tars, planets, or even a common <HI>in&s;ect,</HI> furni&s;h to this worthy fami|ly, ample &s;ubjects for ob&s;ervation, ever edifying, and ever new. His lady has ta&s;te and information enough to enter into the &s;pirit of all the&s;e de&s;crip|tions; and the <HI>general</HI> &s;cene is, not a little enliv|ened by the mode, in which they treat and educate their children.</P>
<P>My good friend is per&s;uaded, that public educa|tion, as it is <HI>generally</HI> managed, is more calculat|ed to teach languages and &s;cience, than to incul|cate <HI>principles</HI> or <HI>morals;</HI> and, therefore, keeps his &s;ons at home till they have acquired a &s;ufficient
<PB N="134" REF="023176_0285_0FBDDE0067C751B0">&s;tock of virtue to &s;erve them as an antidote again&s;t the dangers of the world. They have, however, their regular &s;chool hours and exerci&s;es, which are ob&s;erved with the mo&s;t undeviating punctuali|ty. The older of the boys has made a con&s;idera|ble proficiency in the Latin Language. He has abridged the Engli&s;h and the Roman hi&s;tories, and is completely ver&s;ed in heathen mythology. But, above all, he is in&s;tructed in the fundamentals of religion, and of his duty to God and man. The &s;criptures make a part of his daily reading; and the &s;en&s;ible parent embelli&s;hes them with &s;uch a number of &s;triking ob&s;ervations, as greatly intere&s;t the <HI>curio&s;ity,</HI> and fix the attention of his unvitiated pupil.</P>
<P>With Rollin's Belles Lettres, and the Abbe Millot's <HI>Elementes &s;ur l'hi&s;toire,</HI> he is perfectly ac|quainted. The latter he is abridging; and Tele|machus is warmly pre&s;&s;ed on his attention, as con|taining tho&s;e immortal le&s;&s;ons of virtue, which a|lone can dignify any character or &s;tation.</P>
<P>Eugenio has been at the pains of throwing &s;elect parts of Seneca, Marcus Antoninus, and the Me|morabillia of Xenophon into an Engli&s;h dre&s;s, for the advantage of his little family. He has &s;elect|ed a &s;y&s;tem of Ethics, and almo&s;t of divinity, from the entertaining works of Addi&s;on, John&s;on, The World, &amp;c; and the arrangement is &s;o excel|lent, that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ought to be made public for the bene|fit of mankind.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t morning, that I &s;pent under this happy roof, I was awakened from my &s;lumbers by the &s;oft harmonious voice of Mi&s;s&mdash;, who was chanting to the harp&s;icord, an early hymn of grati|tude
<PB N="135" REF="023176_0286_0FBDDE01E702C548">and devotion to her merciful Creator. It was taken from the Spectator.</P>
<Q><L>When all thy mercies, O my God,</L>
<L>My ri&s;ing &s;oul &s;urveys;</L>
<L>Tran&s;ported with the view, I'm lo&s;t</L>
<L>In wonder, love and prai&s;e.</L></Q>
<P>The whole reminded me of the words of an in|genious poet:</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>J'entends encore &s;a voix, ce language, enchanteur,</L>
<L>Et ces &s;ons &s;ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erains de l'oreille et du coeur.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Her voice th' enchanting language, <HI>&s;till</HI> I hear,</L>
<L>Tho&s;e &s;ov'reign accents of the <HI>heart,</HI> and ear.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>This is her con&s;tant practice every morning, at &s;ix o'clock; and it has the happie&s;t effect on her temper and &s;pirits, for the re&s;t of the day. It &s;ooths the &s;oul to harmony, and cheri&s;hes all the gentler emotions.</P>
<P>Immediately after this was fini&s;hed, the lovely girl took a walk into the garden, as &s;he regularly does, when the weather will permit, to ob&s;erve the gradual progre&s;s, health and vegetation of her plants and flowers. I reque&s;ted the honor of at|tending her, and was amazed, young as &s;he is, with her knowledge of natural hi&s;tory, and with the judicious remarks &s;he made on the power and goodne&s;s, on the wi&s;dom and contrivance of the magnificent Creator.</P>
<P>Before breakfa&s;t, Maria (their mother,) hears all the children together read the p&s;alms and le&s;&s;ons for the day. To this pious exerci&s;e I was not in|vited; but I doubt not it was a &s;pecimen of fe|male eloquence, de&s;canting on the vanity of every
<PB N="136" REF="023176_0287_0FBDDE036931E9E8">thing, but devotion, and glancing at the dangers and temptations of the world.</P>
<P>The employment of this good family is as &s;trict, as u&s;ual, and not le&s;s plea&s;ing even upon Sundays.</P>
<P>The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> exerci&s;e of this day, after the accu&s;tom|ed hymn of prai&s;e to their Creator, is to abridge a few pages of Wil&s;on's Indian In&s;tructed, or of Secker's Lectures on the Catechi&s;m. After the &s;ervice, all the children give in, to the be&s;t of their power, an account of the &s;ermon, which they have heard. The compari&s;on of their different merits is plea&s;ing, and the very <HI>conte&s;t</HI> excites emu|lation.</P>
<P>When <HI>this</HI> is fini&s;hed their father in&s;tructs them with a &s;hort <HI>comment</HI> on the le&s;&s;ons for the day. One happened to be the hi&s;tory of <HI>Dives and Lazarus.</HI> Very few have greater powers of the pathetic than my friend. He brought them all to tears with dwelling on the pitiable circum&s;tances of the <HI>beggar,</HI> and poured this le&s;&s;on into their <HI>&s;oftened</HI> minds, that riches are <HI>apt</HI> to harden the heart, and have no real dignity or u&s;e, but as em|ployed in acts of <HI>mercy</HI> to our <HI>neighbour.</HI> He gave, to the parable at large, a new and <HI>&s;ingular</HI> a&s;pect. He ob&s;erved, that luxury had led Dives to unbe|lief, and that unbelief had plunged him into hell.</P>
<P>On <HI>another</HI> occa&s;ion, he dwelt on the &s;criptural hi&s;tory of Haman. In him, he expatiated on the uncertainty and &s;icklene&s;s of all outward greatne&s;s, and the in&s;ufficiency of honours, &s;tations, popular|ity to confer any <HI>real</HI> happine&s;s on a mind, that had not &s;ubmitted to <HI>internal</HI> government and the di&s;cipline of religion.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="023176_0288_0FBDDE04E9288790">
"What a trifle (&s;aid he,) deranged this great man's enjoyment! Becau&s;e a poor Mordecai would not bow to his pomp, his honours lo&s;t their flavour, and his dignities their charm; his &s;leep went from him, and he refu&s;ed to be comforted. If his pa&s;|&s;ions had been &s;ubdued, and his &s;ould regenerated with divine grace, he would have been contented in the lowe&s;t ob&s;curity. A cottage would have given him more &s;atisfaction than this palace. It would have been irradiated with hope, and it would have &s;miled with divine con&s;olations."</P>
<P>Eugenio is con&s;tant at <HI>church,</HI> and his deport|ment there is an excellent pattern to all its de|pandents. His features are marked with a &s;erious fervour, and a cheerful dignity, when he is humbly pre&s;enting his &s;upplications to the author of his being.</P>
<P>You would be charmed to &s;ee how the hone&s;t pea&s;ants dwell on his looks! what eulogies are ex|pre&s;&s;ed in every countenance! what fervent ble&s;&s;|ings are poured forth, when he &s;tops to enquire about their families and concerns, and what ear|ne&s;t wi&s;hes, that his man&s;ion may long retain him, for its owner, and that his continuance among&s;t them, may be la&s;ting as their days!</P>
<P>Not behind him in any of the <HI>milder</HI> virtues, his con&s;ort <HI>looks up</HI> to him, with a con&s;cious infe|riority, as the pride of her heart. Blended with more <HI>Jofine&s;s,</HI> her piety is, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till more engaging; but &s;he &s;eems to decline all <HI>per&s;onal</HI> con&s;equence, and to be wholly ab&s;orbed in the &s;uperior lu&s;tre of his character and virtues. She receives the prayers and ble&s;&s;ings of their tenants, as if only due to the man of her affections; and, though the zeal of the populace would convey her, in their <HI>arms,</HI> yet, when Eugenio offers his hand
<PB N="138" REF="023176_0289_0FBDDE06682C7C20">to lift her into the carriage, her eyes &s;parkle with peculiar cheerfulne&s;s, and &s;trongly expre&s;s both her love and gratitude to her protector and her friend.</P>
<P>It is no wonder that they are &s;o much admired. No wonder that every tongue loads them with ble&s;&s;ings. This is but the <HI>&s;peculative</HI> part of their piety; the <HI>practical</HI> is more u&s;eful and more en|gaging. They love their God; they love their Redeemer, and for his &s;ake they go about doing good. Not a tenant experiences an uncomforta|ble year, but he receives a con&s;iderable abatement in his rent. Not a per&s;on is injured in all the neighbourhood, but his cau&s;e is pleaded, and his wrongs are redre&s;&s;ed. Not an old man exi&s;ts, but he has &s;omething, by way of <HI>pen&s;ion,</HI> from this virtuous family, to ea&s;e his infirmities, and pillow his declining age. Not a great man endeavours to take advantage of a le&s;&s;er, but my friend, who is an excellent lawyer, undertakes the bu&s;ine&s;s, and expo&s;es the oppre&s;&s;or to his merited contempt.</P>
<P>Every hour, that Maria can &s;pare from her par|ticular dome&s;tic employments, is &s;pent in making garments, providing cordials, phy&s;ic and accom|modations for the naked, the &s;ick and indigent of her village; and there are times of the day, in which you would conclude, from the va&s;t concour&s;e of people, that their hou&s;e was a profe&s;&s;ed <HI>a&s;ylum</HI> for poverty and di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>But now comes out <HI>the great &s;ecret of their happi|ne&s;s.</HI> "Alas!" &s;aid this good man to me, one night, after &s;upper, when he was reviewing the actions of the day, <Q>your obliging partiality thinks me happy, and &s;o inded I <HI>am.</HI> In the tenderne&s;s, friend&s;hip, fidelity and di&s;cretion of
<PB N="139" REF="023176_0290_0FBDDE07E88C0CF8">my Maria, I have more than the trea&s;ures even of a world.

That divine philanthropy, which is the e&s;&s;ence of religion, is the &s;ource of <HI>our</HI> plea&s;ures. And, when I drop into the grave, I &s;hall have but one &s;ingle wi&s;h, that this ami|able guide may be &s;pared to my offspring, and that the poor may pronounce a la&s;t panegyric on me, with their prayers and tears. But how very &s;elfi&s;h and how cruel is the de&s;ire! What would become of the, <HI>then,</HI> lonely and di&s;con|&s;olate Maria? Alas! continually together in this retirement, continually endeared by grow|ing acts of tenderne&s;s, you cannot think how very much our hearts are united! But <HI>this</HI> is the condition of all <HI>human</HI> happine&s;s. The tendere&s;t love mu&s;t feel the bittere&s;t pangs from a &s;eparation.

<P>The&s;e are the &s;entiments of as <HI>fine</HI> a gentleman, as the age can boa&s;t; of one, who would do ho|nour to the polite&s;t circles, and has power to charm the mo&s;t improved under&s;tandings.

<P>It is plain from &s;acred writ, that our pre&s;ent, <HI>earthly,</HI> will be changed into <HI>glorious,</HI> bodies, and our &s;ouls, as it were, &s;ublimed or <HI>re-modified,</HI> as nece&s;&s;ary to the enjoyment of future bli&s;s, <HI>whate|ver</HI> it may be. Whil&s;t therefore we are, in <HI>part,</HI> compo&s;ed of <HI>ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ter,</HI> it is impo&s;&s;ible that we &s;hould have a <HI>full</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ception, or that any <HI>adequate</HI> re|pre&s;entation can be conveyed to us in <HI>words,</HI> of the real nature and <HI>e&s;&s;ence</HI> of &s;uch plea&s;ures, as in fact, are only adapted to minds of a much &s;uper|ior texture, and bodies of a more cele&s;tial and <HI>divine</HI> organization. Thus the &s;criptural images <Q>of thrones, &s;ceptres, kingdoms, of &s;hining as the &s;tars of the firmament, of being clothed in white robes, and having palms in our hands, of
<PB N="141" REF="023176_0292_0FBDDE0AE784D628">feeding in green pa&s;tures, and being led be&s;ide living fountains of waters,</Q> are not to be under|&s;tood, as con&s;tituting any thing of the <HI>real quality</HI> of future happine&s;s, but as imperfectly &s;hadowing forth, by the <HI>analogy</HI> of &s;en&s;ible objects, joys, which, both in their <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>degree,</HI> are wholly rai&s;ed above our pre&s;ent comprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>So &s;trong and literally ju&s;t is that pa&s;&s;age; <Q>Eye has not &s;een nor ear heard, neither has it entered into the heart of man to conceive the things, which God has prepared for them, that love him.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;ame idea is, in &s;ome degree, intended by St. Paul, when he &s;ays, that, <Q>when carried up into the third heaven, he heard things, which it was impo&s;&s;ible for man to utter:</Q> he had, it &s;hould &s;eem, the <HI>idea</HI> of them, but could not convey it, in <HI>human</HI> words, to the <HI>human</HI> under|&s;tanding. It is &s;ufficient for us to know, that the&s;e delights will be of a <HI>&s;piritual</HI> nature, pro|ceeding from the &s;upreme, all-perfect <HI>&s;pirit,</HI> and adapted to the fulle&s;t capacities of tho&s;e, he has been plea&s;ed to <HI>glorify;</HI> that they will be exqui&s;ite, as unbounded power and wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s can be&s;tow, and la&s;ting, as the days of that <HI>eternal</HI> heaven, in which, they &s;pring.</P>
<P>That we &s;hall be able to recognize <HI>&s;pirits,</HI> and among&s;t others, tho&s;e of our neare&s;t <HI>intimates</HI> after death, is <HI>probable</HI> from the very nature of the &s;oul, which cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to lo&s;e its <HI>con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s</HI> or <HI>recollection,</HI> whil&s;t the body is &s;leeping in the du&s;t of the earth&mdash;from the po&s;&s;ibility, that an exqui|&s;ite part of future happine&s;s will ari&s;e from review|ing, along with <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> friends, the trials, tempta|tions, and &s;orrows, which we overcame, along
<PB N="142" REF="023176_0293_0FBDDE0C69042EE0">with them, upon earth&mdash;and, more e&s;pecially, from the attributes of God, which &s;eem <HI>pledged</HI> to convince us, by, (as it were,) <HI>ocular</HI> demon&s;tration, that tho&s;e, who, we are well a&s;&s;ured, &s;uffered un|de&s;ervedly, in various methods here, are reward|ed hereafter, and that &s;ome guilty per&s;ons, who wanted no pro&s;perities in <HI>this</HI> world, experience all the horrors of another.</P>
<P>To this doctrine, there is but one weak, and ill-founded objection; that witne&s;&s;ing the mi&s;ery of friends, if they died in a &s;inful &s;tate, mu&s;t be a dreadful abatement of our own felicity. That is impo&s;&s;ible. The affection betwixt relatives <HI>here</HI> was implanted only for <HI>temporary</HI> purpo&s;es, and will, in &s;ome ca&s;es, cea&s;e after death. The only attachment, <HI>then,</HI> will be, (as the only <HI>rational</HI> one, <HI>always was,</HI>) to &s;ouls, that <HI>a&s;&s;imilate</HI> in <HI>real wi&s;|dom, purity and goodne&s;s.</HI> We &s;hall love, in our de|gree, even as <HI>God</HI> loveth, not with the weakne&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion or in&s;tinct, but the unchangable &s;ubli|mity of <HI>order.</HI> <Q>They, that do the will of our Father in heaven, will be our fathers and bre|thren, our &s;i&s;ters and mothers.</Q></P>
<P>How glorious and inexhau&s;tible a &s;ource of hap|pine&s;s does &s;uch a pro&s;pect open to the mind! With what rapture will a tender mother, who left a number of children behind her, with a thou&s;and, anxious apprehen&s;ions for their &s;afety, meet them in heaven, where their innocence is crowned, their trials are fini&s;hed, and their eternal happine&s;s &s;e|cured! With what dutiful tran&s;ports will children embrace the religious parent, to who&s;e coun&s;els <HI>under Providence,</HI> they owe con&s;iderably their pre|&s;ent glorification! And what delight mu&s;t it give both parties to reflect, that death can, no more,
<PB N="143" REF="023176_0294_0FBDDE0DE78412D8">divorce them from each other, nor a grain of &s;or|row poi&s;on their cup of bli&s;s! Affectionate broth|ers and &s;i&s;ters, <HI>unavoidably</HI> &s;evered <HI>here,</HI> by various, important exigences, with what ardour will they renew their natural connection, and reciprocate each other's joys! Not a fear to ri&s;e upon their future pro&s;pects, not a cloud to darken the cele&s;tial &s;ky!</P>
<P><HI>Another</HI> delightful idea of heaven is, that it will bring to <HI>maturity</HI> all tho&s;e amiable in&s;tincts, which were planted in us by the Deity, whil&s;t we were on earth, but from a multitude of ob&s;tacles, or the &s;hortne&s;s of life, could not attain their per|fection.</P>
<P>Our &s;trong thir&s;t for happine&s;s, it is, on all hands, allowed, that was only mocked in a world of <HI>&s;hadows,</HI> will be fully gratified in one of glory.</P>
<P>It will, probably, be &s;o with our pa&s;&s;ion for knowledge &mdash; friend&s;hip&mdash;&s;ociety &mdash; which, when properly directed, are equally virtuous and u&s;eful, propen&s;ities, and, therefore, alike proceed from the Author of every perfect gift.</P>
<P>How eagerly do &s;ome men thir&s;t after know|ledge, but how much are they retarded in the pur|&s;uit, by the imperfection of their pre&s;ent organs, the weakne&s;s of their bodily frame, by the long, lo&s;t &s;pace of childhood and old age, by the want of books, acquaintance, and other opportunities, or by the tran&s;itorine&s;s of life it&s;elf!&mdash;or when all human advantages center in one, privileged man, enlightened as he may <HI>&s;eem,</HI> what is his wi&s;|dom, but comparative folly? When contra&s;ted with the immen&s;ity of &s;cience, and the inexha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ti|ble wonders of creation, what does it re&s;emble, but a grain, an atom, a drop of water, or a par|ticle
<PB N="144" REF="023176_0295_0FBDDE0F6884D550">of &s;and on the &s;ea &s;hore? Here we &s;ee but through "a gla&s;s darkly." A Newton and a Locke, after all their improvements, felt and con|fe&s;&s;ed this <HI>poverty</HI> of &s;oul.</P>
<P>But how &s;ublime will be the plea&s;ures of this in|tercour&s;e in heaven, when the greate&s;t men, that have ever lived, are all collected together from all quarters of the world! When there are no little envies, jealou&s;ies, intere&s;ts or bigotries to inter|rupt their mutual concord and improvements! nor any languor, fatigue or di&s;ea&s;e in the renovat|ed frame! When the Almighty &s;hall have unlock|ed all the trea&s;ures of his wi&s;dom, all the &s;ecrets of his government, and the wonders of his grace<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. When the &s;ould &s;hall have received &s;uch fre&s;h and &s;uperior inlets of intelligence, and "we &s;hall know, even as we are known." The wondrous page of nature will then be plain. The book of Providence will open, in the mo&s;t legible charact|ers, on the enlarged mind. That my&s;tery of re|demption, into which the very angels have been de&s;irous to look, will be unfolded, in all its aby&s;&s;es; and the con&s;equence of &s;uch di&s;coveries mu&s;t be an inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;en&s;ation of love, a&s;toni&s;hment and rapture. <Q>We &s;hall not cea&s;e, day or night, to wor&s;hip him, that &s;itteth on the throne, and the Lamb, that has wa&s;hed us from our &s;ins, in his own blood.</Q></P>
<P>The ca&s;e, in all <HI>probability,</HI> will be the &s;ame with <HI>friend&s;hip.</HI> Friend&s;hip, balm of this unea&s;y &s;tate! in&s;pirer of virtuous thoughts and coun&s;els! medi|cine of life! &s;till chequered, &s;till imperfect upon earth, mixed with caprice, with pa&s;&s;ion, with in|&s;incerity, and often chilled by death, (thou&s;ands of <HI>congenial</HI> &s;ouls prevented by &s;eas, mountains,

The amiable of all ages and nations &s;hall be a&s;&s;embled together, frailties and death, and the <HI>po&s;&s;ibility</HI> of &s;eparation, wholly done away!</P>
<P>Think only of the expan&s;ion and luxury the mind enjoys from unbo&s;oming its plea&s;ures or &s;or|rows to a per&s;on upon earth, from the &s;ocial glow and confidential conver&s;ation! and imagine, for a moment, what this privilege mu&s;t be, where all around us are friends&mdash;where friends are angels&mdash; and angels are continually imbibing fre&s;h &s;treams of knowledge, of purity and graces in the pre|&s;ence of their God!</P>
<P>Our <HI>&s;ocial</HI> in&s;tinct likewi&s;e, will, doubtle&s;s, have a <HI>&s;imilar</HI> gratification. People are drawn to|gether into <HI>&s;ocieties</HI> on <HI>earth,</HI> by a &s;imilarity of ta&s;tes, pur&s;uits, habits and improvements. The principle is <HI>natural</HI> and has many <HI>laudable</HI> effects; and from the nature of the human &s;oul, which will, probably, be going through &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;tages of improvement to all eternity, may be &s;uppo&s;ed likely to <HI>continue</HI> in a glorified &s;tate. Thus, though holine&s;s and purity be the <HI>alone</HI> medium of <HI>admi&s;&s;ion</HI> into the&s;e ble&s;&s;ed man&s;ions, yet &s;ocieties may be formed of people of &s;imilar improvements and congenial ta&s;tes; of holy philo&s;ophers, (&s;uppo&s;e,) naturali&s;ts, divines, doubly endeared by this re|&s;emblance, and carrying their various re&s;earches to perfection, in a world, where knowledge is to|tally unob&s;tructed, and in the pre&s;ence of him, from whom all wi&s;dom and all goodne&s;s flows. Whil&s;t the different man&s;ions of heaven may re|&s;emble,
<PB N="146" REF="023176_0297_0FBDDE1267EB3148">on this principle, the &s;cattered groups of &s;tars in the firmament, and admini&s;ter that charm|ing and exqui&s;ite variety, which &s;eems to be the wonderful plan of Providence through the <HI>whole</HI> creation.</P>
<P>Thus much, at lea&s;t, may be fairly inferred, that the <HI>intellectual</HI> improvements, we have made <HI>here,</HI> will not <HI>peri&s;h</HI> in the <HI>grave.</HI> We &s;hall, doubtle&s;s, in this re&s;pect, ri&s;e with the &s;ame views and <HI>habits of thinking,</HI> with which we died. How much men at pre&s;ent, differ, from this cau&s;e alone, &s;o that the <HI>lea&s;t,</HI> and the <HI>mo&s;t</HI> enlightened, almo&s;t appear creatures of <HI>another &s;pecies,</HI> needs not be ob|&s;erved. And, though a Boyle or a Bacon, would from an union in <HI>goodne&s;s</HI> only, be happy in the conver&s;ation of the mo&s;t illiterate &s;aint, yet, on all principles of <HI>analogy,</HI> it may, rea&s;onably, be pre&s;umed, that their bli&s;s could not fail to be in|finitely heightened by the &s;ociety of tho&s;e, who, like them, had &s;pent a whole life in laudable in|ve&s;tigations.</P>
<P>But the <HI>grand</HI> idea is, that the "great I AM will be pre&s;ent!" He, who is the &s;ource of all per|fection and ble&s;&s;ings! He, who can open, in the mind, innumerable avenues of <HI>inconceivable</HI> enjoy|ment! Who&s;e whole creation is but a ray, eman|ing from the plenitude of his happine&s;s and glory, and who will certainly give his children all that their <HI>enlarged</HI> faculties can admit of plea&s;ure and fruition.</P>
<P><HI>Here</HI> we are continually mocked with the <HI>ap|pearance</HI> of happine&s;s, which, on trial, is always found checkered with ill. Here the &s;weete&s;t odour has attendant briars; the mo&s;t delicious land&s;cape has its &s;hade; the mo&s;t, apparently, fini&s;hed enjoyment,
<PB N="147" REF="023176_0298_0FBDDE13E83BF510">its alloy. Even the &s;weet, engaging child and friend, dear to us, as our own &s;ouls, bring in&s;epa|rable anxieties, and a thou&s;and unquiet apprehen|&s;ions for their health, their innocence and peace. Every enviable acqui&s;ition is followed with its trouble; every acce&s;&s;ion of fortune or intere&s;t, with its cares; and, in the height of <HI>&s;eeming,</HI> wordly bli&s;s, trouble, &s;till, will find, through various <HI>chinks,</HI> its moments of admi&s;&s;ion. But, in heaven, all will be unmixed, all will be perfect, all will be &s;erene!</P>
<P>Such is my private opinion of heaven. Such is the paradi&s;e of my <HI>imagination.</HI> If it be innocent, I have a right to indulge it; if you think it <HI>vi&s;iona|ry,</HI> you are at liberty to reject it. If it be an <HI>error,</HI> it is, at lea&s;t, a plea&s;ing one; and, if it &s;erves to comfort life, or excite us to any laudable im|provements, it has its u&s;es in &s;ociety, and mu&s;t, <HI>ultimately,</HI> promote the glory of God.</P>
<P>I hope it is true, becau&s;e time, which di&s;&s;olves all earthly things, is ever on the wing, and I wi&s;h to have my intimacy with <HI>you,</HI> perpetuated through immortality.</P>

<P>I AM truly concerned for your indi&s;po&s;ition. Your ner<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es are relaxed, and your &s;ipirits cannot &s;ail to be affected in proportion. The complaints of this age, principally, ari&s;e from inactivity and over-indulgence. We thwart nature, in a thou|&s;and in&s;tances, and, in as many, &s;he retaliates the offence.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="023176_0299_0FBDDE1568A5E240">
We almo&s;t <HI>di&s;&s;olve</HI> in hot, carpeted rooms, in|&s;tead of continually expo&s;ing our bodies to the open air. We go to &s;leep, when we &s;hould be ri&s;ing. We invent <HI>artificial</HI> methods of provoking an ap|petite, which can only be excited, in a proper manner, by labour and application. And <HI>factitious</HI> amu&s;ements are vainly bidden to create tho&s;e &s;pi|rits, which &s;hould ari&s;e from exerci&s;e and air.</P>
<P>This may an&s;wer a <HI>temporary</HI> purpo&s;e, but, in the <HI>end,</HI> it would de&s;troy the firme&s;t con&s;titution. It is, in fact, undermining the very ground, upon which we &s;tand, and digging a <HI>premature</HI> grave un|der our feet.</P>
<P>To me, who follow nature, and am only a &s;pectator of the bu&s;tling &s;cenes around me, the&s;e things appear to have &s;erious con&s;equences. When I look at fine, enervated ladies, I tremble, by a &s;ort of <HI>involuntary</HI> in&s;tinct, for the ri&s;ing generation.</P>
<P>What a vigilant, <HI>&s;y&s;tematic</HI> care did the ancient legi&s;lators be&s;tow upon this &s;ex! To give them an healthy, vigorous con&s;titution, and to con&s;ult, in <HI>particular &s;ituations,</HI> their ea&s;e and cheerfulne&s;s, was an object not beneath the attention of tho&s;e heroes, who, by their valour and their talents, go|verned the world.</P>
<P>If you intend to have any comfort your&s;elf, or be of any &s;olid u&s;efulne&s;s to others, you mu&s;t be careful of your health. It is a plant, that requires continual nur&s;ing, and without the greate&s;t atten|tion, will <HI>gradually</HI> die.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t not di&s;&s;olve on <HI>downy</HI> pillows, till your frame is almo&s;t thrown into convul&s;ions. You &s;hould ri&s;e with the <HI>dawn,</HI> and exerci&s;e gent|ly, in the open air, particularly, on hor&s;eback. A little cheerful company will amu&s;e, and keep your
<PB N="149" REF="023176_0300_0FBDDE16E82A4D88">mind, from preying too much upon it&s;elf. Too much, on the other hand, will <HI>oppre&s;s</HI> your &s;pirits, and aggravate your complaints.</P>
<P>Above all, if you wi&s;h a removal of your pre|&s;ent indi&s;po&s;ition, you mu&s;t cautiou&s;ly ab&s;tain from tea, particularly in mornings. However agreea|ble this beverage may be, it is, doubtle&s;s, the &s;ource of weak nerves, hy&s;terical and hypochon|driac affections, and of half tho&s;e dreadful, <HI>para|lytic</HI> &s;ymptoms, which have lately become &s;o gene|ral and alarming.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of <HI>langui&s;hing</HI> in elegant rooms, you &s;hould frequently be &s;trolling into the fields or garden, if you would avoid the bitter draught of an apothecary, or innocently rob the phy&s;ician of his fee. Your <HI>diet</HI> &s;hould be &s;imple and moderate, confined to one di&s;h, and that rather animal, than vegetable. You &s;hould eat &s;paringly, but <HI>often,</HI> and <Q>u&s;e a little wine for your &s;tomach's &s;ake, and your, often, infirmities.</Q> The town has, doubtle&s;s, contributed to your di&s;order. When you return into the country, its pure air, I tru&s;t, and tranquil &s;cenes will con&s;iderably re&s;tore you. Nature never intended &s;uch multitudes of people to be crowded together, and breathe the infinite, noxious effluvia of great cities. They are, in fact, the graves of mankind. We may <HI>exi&s;t</HI> in them for a time; but it is only in the country, that health has any thing of its natural vigour, or life, of its enjoyment.</P>
<P>Do not <HI>tamper</HI> with your con&s;titution. The whole power of medicine, in <HI>your</HI> ca&s;e, does not afford the &s;hadow of relief. Di&s;orders of this kind baffle all the penetration of the medi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> fraternity.

<P>IF I had the opportunity, it would give me great plea&s;ure to the of your party to Bath. But indeed I am quite fixed and &s;tationary here; unable to move, or vi&s;it even my neare&s;t friends. Every day brings, along with it, a train of engagements; and almo&s;t every hour, &s;ub&s;tantial duties, that cannot be omitted.</P>
<P>Nature, at times, is di&s;po&s;ed to repine, and think &s;uch confinement an intolerable hard&s;hip, till I begin to reflect, that all durable plea&s;ure is de|rived from employment, and that the only, real <HI>di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nity</HI> of life con&s;i&s;ts <HI>in d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing good.</HI></P>
<P>They, who are <HI>continually</HI> in motion, and vary|ing the &s;cene, are not that I can di&s;cover, more &s;atisfied than my&s;elf. They carry their private burdens, along with them, over hills and moun|tains; and, when they have exhau&s;ted the
<PB N="151" REF="023176_0302_0FBDDE19E86BF620">whole circle of plea&s;ures, &s;till there is a great void in the &s;oul.</P>
<P>I was once, for five weeks at Bath, and recollect it with a mixture of gratitude and plea&s;ure. It was particularly &s;erviceable to my health; and, on the whole, made impre&s;&s;ions on my mind, that will never be era&s;ed.</P>
<P>The very <HI>ride</HI> to this place wil amazingly re|vive you. Worce&s;ter&s;hire, at this &s;ea&s;on of the year, is one grand magnificent garden, who&s;e air is perfume, who&s;e &s;cenery is blo&s;&s;oms, and who&s;e walls are the &s;pacious canopy of heaven. If you make Bri&s;tol in your way, I dare promi&s;e, that your curio&s;ity will be amply gratified by a &s;ight of that ancient and exten&s;ive city. Though the place, <HI>in it&s;elf,</HI> is low and dirty, yet the adjacent country is, perhaps, the mo&s;t picture&s;que and beau|tiful in Britain. Clifton Hill is deliciou&s;ly ro|mantic; on one &s;ide commanding a full pro&s;pect of the city, and looking, on the other, towards that magnificent ocean, which brings the inhabitants all their merchandize and riches. At the foot of this eminence, you will de&s;cry the medicinal &s;pring of the hot-wells, &s;o celebrated for their efficacy in <HI>con&s;umptive</HI> ca&s;es. Here you will be &s;hocked with a number of walking <HI>&s;keletons,</HI> who are yellow with &s;ickne&s;s, dying of con&s;umptions, and breathing in their &s;ighs, the emptine&s;s and vanity of all hu|man things. Thus is no human plea&s;ure to be un|mixed; and thus are thorns to be intwined with the ro&s;e.</P>
<P>King's We&s;ton Hill, in the environs of this place, has lately been celebrated by a poet. But the copy comes not up to the original. Nature has painted better, than the bard. It is vi&s;ited by
<PB N="152" REF="023176_0303_0FBDDE1B688B93E0">all &s;trangers not only for its <HI>own,</HI> magnificent beauties, and wonderful &s;cenery, but as an oppor|tunity of beholding the &s;ea, which here opens, all at once, in a grand and unexpected expan&s;ion, on the a&s;toni&s;hed eye. If you are fortunate enough to have a fine day, you cannot behold a more &s;ub|lime or &s;triking curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>When you arrive at your journey's end, every thing will de&s;ight you. Regular &s;treets, magnifi|cent buildings, &s;umptuous public rooms, delight|ful pro&s;pects, walls, hills, vallies, fountains, gar|dens, company, amu&s;ements&mdash;all will proclaim, that you are at Bath. You will feel, that this is the <HI>paradi&s;e</HI> of Britain; and that the godde&s;s of health has <HI>here,</HI> more particularly, fixed her abode. The mind, it is true, carries its &s;ecret burdens with it, into every &s;ituation; but I know no place more calculated to efface melancholy impre&s;&s;ions, or do away tho bad effects of over exertion. The waters are a wonderful cordial to the &s;tomach, and a powerful remover of that indige&s;tion, which, to the &s;tudious and the fair of <HI>&s;edentary</HI> lives, is be|come &s;o very general a complaint; and the mind in&s;en&s;ibly, lo&s;es its little, <HI>fanciful</HI> burdens in the <HI>general</HI> gaiety and &s;prightline&s;s of the &s;cene.&mdash; There are, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, many <HI>invalids;</HI> but there are, likewi&s;e, multitudes of young people of both &s;exes, who&s;e manners are very highly engag|ing, and who&s;e faces wear a perpetual &s;mile.</P>
<P>The amu&s;ements, to which you are admitted at a very moderate expence, are conducted with the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ricte&s;t order and decorum; and in the charms and &s;plendour of a ball, as it is managed <HI>here,</HI> one would be led to fancy, that life was wholly com|po&s;ed of plea&s;ure, if it did not occur, that all this
<PB N="153" REF="023176_0304_0FBDDE1CE7CF19E0">brilliant throng have their private vexations, and the heart its own bitterne&s;s <HI>within.</HI></P>
<P>The Abbey church plea&s;es <HI>me</HI> more, than almo&s;t any &s;acred edifice, I have &s;een in the kingdom.&mdash; It has not the grandeur and <HI>magnificence</HI> of &s;ome others, but it is more calculated for u&s;e, and yields to none in elegance and neatne&s;s.</P>
<P>Lady H&mdash;'s chapel is vi&s;ited by all &s;trangers, as an elegant curio&s;ity of the &s;olemn kind, more perhaps, from the melody and &s;weetne&s;s of the &s;inging, than motives of devotion. The good woman, probably founded it in this bo&s;om of plea&s;ure, with a view of calling &s;inners of di&s;tinc|tion to repentance. Her intention was amiable; and her piety, though grounded on the narrow and intolerant principles of Calvin, is entitled to re&s;pect. When people openly give their-money, zeal, talents and labour to <HI>any</HI> cau&s;e, we may tru&s;t their <HI>&s;incerity.</HI> Nor &s;hould critici&s;m expo&s;e the little <HI>involuntary</HI> errors of tho&s;e, who &s;crupulou&s;ly act up to the dictates of their con&s;cience, and have thus literally, "left all and followed Chri&s;t."</P>
<P>Lady H&mdash;, it is &s;aid, has much injured her private fortune by her religious genero&s;ity; in building chapels, &s;upporting preachers, and many other public, and private donations. Prudence, &s;urely did not warrant &s;o extravagant a &s;acrifice. But it is not nece&s;&s;ary to expo&s;e a conduct, which &s;o &s;ew will ever be di&s;po&s;ed to imitate. <HI>Over|righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> is not, by any means, the &s;in of <HI>this</HI> age.</P>
<P>I was indeed, not a little di&s;gu&s;ted with the preacher of the evening, on which I happened to be at her lady&s;hip's chapel. His di&s;cour&s;e was a <HI>violent,</HI> inflammatory harangue without elegance, rea&s;oning or connexion; and con&s;i&s;ted, for the
<PB N="154" REF="023176_0305_0FBDDE1E688CA168">greater part, of a &s;evere abu&s;e of the e&s;tabli&s;hed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">gy. We <HI>are,</HI> perhaps, <HI>too</HI> languid and remi&s;s in the di&s;charge of our duty; but to expo&s;e with <HI>virulence</HI> and rancour, is not &s;urely the method to <HI>reform</HI> us. Declamation or &s;atire irritates. It is &s;olid argument alone, mixed with love and gentle|ne&s;s, which &s;often and converts.</P>
<P>The&s;e people have not the <HI>gracefulne&s;s</HI> of piety. They di&s;play not in their looks or manner, or <HI>cen|&s;ures,</HI> the "beauty of holine&s;s." A &s;evere critic, perhaps, would accu&s;e them of &s;piritual pride, and give them this motto, <Q>Stand from me, for I am holier than thou.</Q> Their preachers appear de|ficient in general knowledge. They do not &s;tudy force of argument or embelli&s;hments of &s;tyle.&mdash; They are not, indeed, without zeal; but it is wild, extravagant and frantic. They do not &s;eem <Q>pit|iful or courteous, or to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that char|ity, which thinke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> not evil.</Q></P>
<P>The greate&s;t di&s;grace to Bath are the <HI>gambling parties</HI> at the lower rooms. Would you believe it po&s;&s;ible? You may &s;ee people of the fir&s;t di&s;tinc|tion who are actuated with the <HI>infernal</HI> rage of play, mixing with a &s;et of the very lowe&s;t, merce|nary &s;harpers! One would &s;uppo&s;e that their pride and ta&s;te alone would not &s;ubmit to &s;uch a <HI>degra|dation.</HI> But &s;o little is all &s;tation, when it has for|gotten its <HI>real</HI> dignity; &s;o groveling is the human mind, when it has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ight of the true &s;ource of happine&s;s, and <Q><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> hewing out for it&s;elf, broken ci&s;terns, that can hold no water!</Q> Even Che&s;|terfield him&s;elf, with all his <HI>parade of graces,</HI> was a dupe to this mo&s;t abominable practice!</P>
<P>The Avon, which runs through this city, filled me with great ideas. Shake&s;peare, Stratford, the
<PB N="155" REF="023176_0306_0FBDDE1FE6E4C980">Jubilee, immortal talents and immortal fame ru&s;h|ed into my mind, as often as I &s;aw its &s;oft, flow|ing &s;tream roll &s;ilently along.</P>
<P>I &s;hould wi&s;h you to take a view of Prior Park, as a place which has &s;o long been &s;acred to &s;cience and the mu&s;es. The late Mr. Allen was the Mae|cenas of his times. You cannot tread the ground about it, without recollecting many of tho&s;e cele|brated wits, who were often invited to this ho&s;pi|table retreat, and entertained its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or with all that luxury of ta&s;te and lu&s;cious flow of &s;oul which genius in&s;pires.</P>
<P>A great character &s;tamps an immortality on the places he frequents, or the hou&s;es he inhabits.&mdash; Prior Park will be remembered, when its elegance is mouldered. <HI>Fancy</HI> will plant a laurel round this man&s;ion of ta&s;te, which will continue to be green when the man&s;ion it&s;elf &s;hall have crumbled into atoms.</P>
<P>You will much oblige me by a frequency of let|ters, whil&s;t you are at Bath. They will improve your own talent at the <HI>de&s;criptive.</HI> To me they will give a more lively recollection of plea&s;ures, which I once enjoyed. They will retrace upon my mind, agreeable &s;cenes and images, which I have, <HI>formerly,</HI> beheld. They will intere&s;t an heart, that always vibrates to <HI>your</HI> plea&s;ures or your pains. They will relieve &s;pirits that are too much oppre&s;&s;ed by a variety of thoughts. <HI>Whil&s;t</HI> I read them, I &s;hall forget, that I had ever a com|plaint, or that I ever was unhappy.</P>
