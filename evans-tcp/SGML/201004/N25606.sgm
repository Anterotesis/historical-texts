<HEAD>An ADDRESS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>FELLOW CITIZENS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHILST we are prompted by a &s;pirit of philanthro|py to de&s;ire the general happine&s;s of Mankind; &s;ound policy and ju&s;tice dictate the nece&s;&s;ity of promoting, in a more e&s;pecial manner, the pro&s;perity, the happine&s;s and the independence of our fellow citizens. The law of Nature, as &s;upported by rea&s;on, pre&s;cribes to us this cour&s;e, as the only ju&s;t foundation of our own individual happine&s;s or &s;afety.</P>
<P>The ancients, almo&s;t univer&s;ally, agreed that Man was formed by Nature for &s;ociety, and therefore obliged to ob|&s;erve and practice whatever tends to the good of the com|munity, of which he is a member. This comprehen&s;ive rule was in all ages re&s;pected, until Hobbes, and other de|voted &s;laves to Tyrants, broached the dete&s;table opinion, that the &s;tate of Nature, in re&s;pect to Man, is a &s;tate of war; that con&s;equently all Men are enemies to each other, and that they are only to be governed by fear. This doctrine has been oppo&s;ed by &s;everal eminent writers, and our obli|gation to render each other every friendly a&s;&s;i&s;tance has been e&s;tabli&s;hed on a more rational foundation. Dr. Sharrack, of Oxford, in the year 1660, publi&s;hed a valuable work, on the duties of Man, according to the law of Nature; he appears to be one of the fir&s;t who attempted to &s;upply the great defect complained of by Lord Verulam, "that due care had not been taken to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;ome certain principle for a foundation of morality." He con&s;idered that the end
<PB N="4" REF="034011_0003_10010B1C345F6110">of every worthy and virtuous action is to remove unea&s;ine&s;s, and enjoy a &s;erene tranquillity. The learned and good Bi&s;hop of Cumberland, &s;ome years afterwards, publi&s;hed a valuable treati&s;e on the &s;ame &s;ubject; in which he maintains that the greate&s;t benevolence of every rational agent towards all, forms the happie&s;t &s;tate of every and of all, and is nece&s;&s;ari|ly requi&s;ite to the be&s;t &s;tate to which Man can attain, and therefore, the common good is the &s;upreme law.</P>
<P>The Earl of Shaft&s;bury con&s;idered the whole Univer&s;e as one &s;y&s;tem, compo&s;ed of infinite other le&s;&s;er &s;y&s;tems, and the&s;e again of others. As our &s;olar &s;y&s;tem has its &s;everal orbs, each of which is another &s;y&s;tem of it&s;elf: And what|ever there may be in the re&s;t, in this of ours we know there are many &s;y&s;tems, each made up of individuals, and every of the&s;e of different parts, each of which may be perfect in it&s;elf, con&s;idered as a part, as a perfect eye, hand, &amp;c. but its u&s;e has reference to the whole, of which it is immediately a part; that to its greater, that again to another, and &s;o on to the whole.</P>
<P>All tho&s;e luminous Bodies ob&s;ervable in the Heavens, how|ever infinite in number, or di&s;tant, materially communicate with this Globe, and it is highly probable, that all and every of them contribute to the &s;upport and carrying on the work of each other: And con&s;equently that they all make one univer&s;al whole &s;y&s;tem; they mu&s;t all, therefore, be exactly proportioned and fitted each to the others' operations; for otherwi&s;e they mu&s;t prove de&s;tructive one to the other, and produce the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>We know that the Planets within our own &s;y&s;tem have their projectile forces &s;o &s;uited to their gravities or attraction, as to perform their motions nearly in circles, which they do
<PB N="5" REF="034011_0004_10010B1E98713B90">with &s;uch con&s;tancy, that all the eclip&s;es of the luminaries that were ever known to have happened, or that may here|after happen, can be calculated to an hour with the &s;ame cer|tainty, as tho&s;e of the pre&s;ent year.</P>
<P>In the animal and vegetable creation, every &s;pecies is fur|ni&s;hed with ve&s;&s;els, glands, and liquids the be&s;t adapted to its kind and to the perfection of its exi&s;tence; accompanied, at the &s;ame time, with that uninterrupted con&s;tancy and un|erring certainty, that there is &s;carcely any one &s;pecies of ani|mal or vegetable, as has ever been known with certainty to have exi&s;ted on this Globe, but the &s;ame may be found at this day.</P>
<P>Such is the wonderful regularity of all Nature; that even the &s;malle&s;t particles of matter are &s;o uniform in their ope|rations, that the effects which they will produce under parti|cular circum&s;tances are known <HI>a priori,</HI> although the&s;e par|ticles are &s;o &s;mall that they e&s;cape all our &s;en&s;es. A particle of light, which by a variety of experiments is a&s;certained to he matter, is &s;o inconceivably &s;mall, that Dr. Barrow gave it as his opinion, that a particle of light is as much le&s;s than a grain of &s;and as that grain is le&s;s than the whole world.</P>
<P>Thus, from the mo&s;t &s;tupendous immen&s;ity, to the minut|e&s;t particles that can be conceived,&mdash;order, proportion, fitne&s;s and congruity in the relation and government of all things univer&s;ally prevail, and this order is eternal. Every thing in the creation is found relative to a certain end, and though infinitely varied among them&s;elves, are &s;o managed and com|bined as to con&s;pire all to the general de&s;ign of univer&s;al good.</P>
<P>When we con&s;ider this beautiful order, e&s;tabli&s;hed in the phy&s;ical world, it is impo&s;&s;ible to believe for a moment, that
<PB N="6" REF="034011_0005_10010B20D6D6BDA0">Man, de&s;igned the brighte&s;t ornament of the creation, &s;hould forever remain de&s;titute of moral and political knowledge, the wretched object of injury and oppre&s;&s;ion. On the con|trary, God him&s;elf declared the perfectibility of the nature of Man, when he appeared to Abram, and &s;aid "I am the Almighty God, walk before me and be thou perfect." Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, confirms this doctrine in a &s;er|mon breathing a &s;pirit of general philanthropy and replete with the warme&s;t &s;entiments of virtue, truth and ju&s;tice. He &s;ays to his Di&s;ciples, "be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father who is in Heaven is perfect." This opinion of the &s;tate of ab&s;olute perfection and happine&s;s, de&s;igned for Man in this world, is not only &s;upported by the powerful authority of the Holy Writings, but by Rea&s;on; which manife&s;ts to us, that the end which God had in view with regard to his Crea|tures, and particularly with re&s;pect to Man, was a &s;tate of perfection and happine&s;s in this world. On whatever &s;ide we turn our eyes, we &s;ee nothing in nature which is not go|verned by laws proper to its exi&s;tence, and which is not or|ganized in a manner to obey &s;uch laws; to acquire every &s;uccour which is agreeable to the nature of its being, or ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the mode of its exi&s;tence. Man is not neglected by his Creator: The gifts which to him are particular, and which give him the empire of the world, manife&s;t that hap|pine&s;s and pro&s;perity are de&s;igned for him, and an order pro|per to en&s;ure him the enjoyment of them.</P>
<P>However Mankind may differ in opinion, re&s;pecting the perfectibility of Human Nature, all agree in deploring its mi&s;eries. This degraded &s;tate of Man has been affected by the Executive Magi&s;trates of all Countries; who have uni|formly encroached on the liberties of the People, until &s;uch times as they filched from them their Sovereignty, and re|duced
<PB N="7" REF="034011_0006_1000F8DB705D1A80">them to a &s;tate of wretchedne&s;s. Wars created by ambitious Executives have been undertaken more to their own aggrandizement and power, than for the protection of their Country. The People, involved in a &s;tate of abject mi&s;ery by accumulated wrongs, and drove almo&s;t to a &s;tate of de&s;peration,&mdash;are comforted with a promi&s;e of eternal hap|pine&s;s, by intere&s;ted Prie&s;ts, who participate with the Go|vernment in the plunder of its Citizens.</P>
<P>To e&s;cape from this combination of outrage and deception, our ance&s;tors fled to the Wilderne&s;s of America; where they might enjoy their religious and political opinions without in&s;ult or injury. The native Indians gave them a kind re|ception, and at once permitted them to partake of all the ad|vantages they enjoyed them&s;elves. Although William Penn, according to the unju&s;tifiable cu&s;tom of Europe, received a grant from the King of England, of the territory of Penn|&s;ylvania, of which he was declared &s;ole proprietor; yet, on his taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, a &s;pirit of ju&s;tice and philanthropy, which in all his tran&s;actions marked his conduct through life, engaged him to purcha&s;e the &s;oil from the Natives; by which means the colony was pre&s;erved in peace, and flouri&s;hed. The only difficulties it had to encounter were occa&s;ioned by the arbitrary regulations of the Briti&s;h Court, which interdicted our municipal regulations, ob&s;tructed our progre&s;s in manu|factures, and re&s;tricted our commerce; by which means &s;he enjoyed a monopoly of the produce of our indu&s;try, highly injurious to this Country. Rou&s;ed at length by repeated in|juries, Penn&s;ylvania, united with her &s;i&s;ter Colonies, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the blood and trea&s;ure of that brave and generous People, the French, we became a free, independent Republic. Having in this manner rejected the Government of Great Britain, and now united with our &s;i&s;ter States for mutual aid and protection,&mdash;it becomes the undoubted duty of every
<PB N="8" REF="034011_0007_10010B225ED6B6E0">Citizen of the United States, to give encouragement to the Mechanics, and Manufacturers of our Country; not by promoting prohibitory laws again&s;t the importation of Fo|reign Fabrics, but by calling our own manufactures into u&s;e; by which means we &s;hall afford them the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial en|couragement.</P>
<P>The local and phy&s;ical advantages enjoyed by the United States, afford to her Citizens the means of being &s;upplied within them&s;elves with mo&s;t articles nece&s;&s;ary or u&s;eful in life. This being an undeniable fact, it becomes criminal in her Citizens not to derive all the advantages in their power from circum&s;tances thus placed within their reach. Civil &s;ociety is &s;o con&s;tituted, that its &s;tate of pro&s;perity and power ari&s;es from the independence and pro&s;perity of its members, and as eve|ry Citizen affords his aid to &s;upport its municipal regula|tions, by which the property of all is protected, it becomes not only the duty, but the intere&s;t, of every individual to promote the pro&s;perity and independence of his Fellow Citi|zens. It is computed, that the Mechanics, and Manufactu|rers within the United States comprehend one twentieth part of our Citizens; that the Merchants, Agents, &amp;c. com|po&s;e one twentieth, and that eighteen twentieths are engag|ed in Agriculture. Tho&s;e Men who&s;e inclinations lead them to Mechanic or Manufacturing occupations for a &s;upport, and who have no de&s;ire to engage in the cares and fatigues of a Country life, will con&s;ider it for their advantage, that their Fellow-Citizens &s;hould give a preference to the produce of their indu&s;try, over Foreign Manufactures. The Mer|chants, merely as Agents, no doubt con&s;ider, that every kind of Mechanic and Manufacturing employ &s;hould be di&s;cou|raged within the United States, as agents equally intere&s;ted in &s;upporting the pro&s;perity of the Foreign Manufacturer, as
<PB N="9" REF="034011_0008_10010B240544D0E0">the American Farmer; they &s;hould rather be con&s;idered as Citizens of the World, than Citizens of any particular Com|monwealth. To &s;end Clay to England to be returned made into Bricks, Lime&s;tone into Lime, and Wheat into Flour, would not be more ab&s;urd than the practice we have been in, for many years, of exporting our Flax-Seed, Iron and Furs to Europe, to be returned in a variety of Manufactur|ed Articles, equally capable of being fabricated among&s;t our|&s;elves. Exporting all your Raw Materials to Europe, to be manufactured, would create a great degree of bu&s;tle at our &s;ea-ports; would create a great quantity of &s;hipping and would increa&s;e the bu&s;ine&s;s and wealth of the Merchants, but it would certainly add nothing to the actual wealth or in|dependence of our Country.</P>
<P>The Farmers, comprehending eighteen-twentieths of the People of the United States, are &s;o advantageously &s;ituated, that they can manufacture, immediately from their own Farms, all the Woollen and Linen Cloth nece&s;&s;ary in their families, and at a cheaper rate than any imported; taking into con&s;ideration the &s;uperior quality of the Dome&s;tic Ma|nufacture, for real u&s;e, and the time and labour be&s;towed and &s;aved by the family. Independent of this important fact, it is the peculiar intere&s;t of the Farmers, that they &s;hould give every encouragement to the Mechanics, and Ma|nufacturers of the United States; by which they may pro|cure a certain and &s;teady market at their own doors, for the &s;urplus produce of their indu&s;try; which could not be inter|rupted by Foreign competition, or de&s;troyed by the impolitic mea&s;ures of our own Executive Government, or by the arbitra|ry laws of foreign Countries. The labour of the Citizens of the United States, actually engaged in Manufactures, can|to be procured at the low rate of that of the Subjects of
<PB N="10" REF="034011_0009_10010B25931423D8">England, either in Europe, or in India; nor &s;hould it be looked for by any man who values the real independence of his country. An exchange, for the mutual advantage of the parties, ought to be &s;upported by ju&s;tice. Every manufac|turer &s;hould have &s;uch an equivalent for his labour as to enable him to live with comfort; to educate his children and to pre&s;erve &s;omething for the &s;upport of his family in ca&s;e of unavoidable accident. This is &s;o far from being the ca&s;e in the Briti&s;h dominions, from whence we derive mo&s;t of our manufactures, that but a &s;mall number of the workmen re|ceive an adequate compen&s;ation for their labour.</P>
<P>In rewarding their exertions or ingenuity no rule of equity is attended to; on the contrary, a combination takes place to reduce the wages of the manufacturer to a &s;canty &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. From the tendere&s;t infancy they are doomed to perpetual la|bour, and have no time, even in childhood, for the nece&s;&s;ary exerci&s;e of the body, or the cultivation of the mind. Thus the poor man, upon who&s;e indu&s;try depends the &s;o much boa&s;ted extent of Briti&s;h manufactures is, by the force of ar|bitrary regulations, obliged to &s;uch exce&s;&s;ive toil, that he is re|duced to a mere animal exi&s;tence, having no intere&s;t in the pro&s;perity of his country, or as little capable of &s;erving it in time of danger.</P>
<P>In Briti&s;h India, Mr. Bolts and Colonel Dow concur in opi|nion re&s;pecting the &s;evere treatment the manufacturers expe|rience.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bolts' India Affairs, page 193&mdash;194.</NOTE> "The a&s;&s;ent of the poor weaver is, in general, not deemed nece&s;&s;ary to the bargain, for the goma&s;tahs or agents, when employed in the company's inve&s;tments, frequently make them &s;ign what they plea&s;e and, upon the weavers re|fu&s;ing to take the money offered, it has been known that they have had it tied in their girdles, and they have been &s;ent away with a flogging. A number of tho&s;e weavers are al&s;o gene|rally
<PB N="11" REF="034011_0010_10010B28C1EDDDB0">regi&s;tered in the books of the company's goma&s;tahs, and not permitted to work for any others, being transferred from one to another, like &s;o many &s;laves, and &s;ubject to the roguery of every &s;ucceeding goma&s;tah. The winders of raw &s;ilk have been treated al&s;o with &s;uch inju&s;tice, that in&s;tances have been known of their cutting off their thumbs to prevent their being forced to wind &s;ilk." By &s;uch horrid outrages, again&s;t the rights of millions of our fellow creatures, do we become furni&s;hed, at &s;o cheap a price, with the manufactures of the Briti&s;h dominions.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent gloomy appearance of our public affairs has no doubt been occa&s;ioned by the Citizens of the United States having too much neglected the repre&s;entative principles of the federal government, and looking up to one man for the &s;alva|tion of our country. Similar cau&s;es will produce &s;imilar ef|fects to the end of time. Whenever men; by the abu&s;e of that free will, given to them by the author of the univer&s;e for their own well-being, make u&s;e of it to de&s;troy the natural order of things, in the moral and phy&s;ical world, confu&s;ion and di&s;tre&s;s mu&s;t be the con&s;equence. When that highly fa|vored people, the Jews, &s;ought a king to rule over them, God con&s;idered it not as an offence again&s;t Samuel and their El|ders, but again&s;t him&s;elf; as manife&s;ting a de&s;ire to follow the corruptions of other nations, and to pervert the natural order which he had e&s;tabli&s;hed for the good of the univer&s;e. He therefore gave them a king in his wrath, who was a cur&s;e to them, as kings have been a cur&s;e to mankind from that day to the pre&s;ent time. The kingly power, after having bee a &s;courge to Europe for ages, is now, by the light of the Ame|rican and French revolutions, coming to an end. It is devout|ly to be wi&s;hed, that the citizens of the United States may be upon their guard not to &s;uffer even the appearance of kingly
<PB N="12" REF="034011_0011_10010B2A49F7C5E8">authority to return among&s;t us to bla&s;t the fair pro&s;pects of our revolution. The liberty of our country mu&s;t be &s;upport|ed on the foundation of that equality, a&s;certained by the laws of the creation, &s;upported by the go&s;pel, which acknowledges no di&s;tinction of bond or free. Self-intere&s;t may oppo&s;e, and &s;ophi&s;try may cavil, but equality, in its rational acceptation, as relating to civil privileges and impartial laws, gives dignity to the human character and prompts it to acts worthy of its origin.</P>
<P>Finally, republicans, let it be our &s;tudious care to vindicate the rights of oppre&s;&s;ed humanity and to remove the fal&s;e im|pre&s;&s;ions of all unju&s;t di&s;tinctions. Let us cultivate the principles of philanthropy, ju&s;tice and equality, which are alto|gether incompatible with tho&s;e &s;y&s;tems of oppre&s;&s;ion and inju&s;tice, which for a length of time have darkened the face of the European world.</P>
<P>Let us not precipitately endeavour to accompli&s;h that to day, which the di&s;&s;emination of truth will make unavoida|ble to-morrow: Let us not anxiou&s;ly watch for occa&s;ions and events; the a&s;cendency of truth is independent of events. Let us anxiou&s;ly refrain from violence; force is not convic|tion, and is extremely unworthy of the cau&s;e of ju&s;tice: Let us admit into our bo&s;oms neither contempt, animo&s;ity, re&s;entment nor revenge. The cau&s;e of ju&s;tice is the cau&s;e of humanity; its advocates &s;hould overflow with univer&s;al good will. We &s;hould love this cau&s;e; for it conduces to the general happine&s;s of mankind. We &s;hould love it; for there is not a man that lives, who, in the natural and tran|quil progre&s;s of things, will not be made happier by its ap|proach.</P>
