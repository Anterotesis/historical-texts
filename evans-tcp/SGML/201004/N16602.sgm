<P>THE SERMON on the <HI>holy rite</HI> of CON|FIRMATION, was delivered in New-York, in Saint George's chapel, on Sunday May the 4th in&s;t. and (with a little variation) in the afternoon of that day, in Saint Paul's chapel.</P>
<P>This &s;acred rite was admini&s;tered in the fir&s;t mentioned of the&s;e chapels, on Sunday, April the 27th la&s;t, and in the other chapel, the day the &s;ermon was preached.

<P>He hath &s;hewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do ju&s;tly; and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SERIOUS is the truth, that tho&s;e who enjoy the greate&s;t &s;piritual privileges, are not always the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h|ed for the practice of virtue!</P>
<P>How highly favoured, for in&s;tance, were the people of I&s;rael?&mdash;"Unto them," it is &s;aid, "pertained the adop|tion; and the glory; and the covenants; and the giving of the law; and the &s;ervice of God; and the promi&s;es."<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Rom. ix. 4.</NOTE></P>
<P>But were they, in general, obedient to the will of Hea|ven? How often did the Almighty complain of their impieties?</P>
<P>"I have &s;pread out my hands," &s;aid he, "all the day, unto a rebellious people, who walk in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts; who provoke me to anger continually to my face."<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. lxv. 2, 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>"This people of Jeru&s;alem is &s;lidden back with a perpe|tual back&s;liding; they hold fa&s;t deceit; they refu&s;e to re|turn. I hearkened and heared, but they &s;pake not aright. No man repented him of his wickedne&s;s, &s;aying, What have I done? Every one turned to his cour&s;e, as the hor&s;e ru&s;h|eth into the battle."<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Jer. viii. 5, 6.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="021347_0005_0FB31BCC9CF45A80">Often did God inflict judgments on his people to reclaim them from vice; and often, to accompli&s;h this end, did he addre&s;s them in language of threatning and reproof, by the voice of his prophets.</P>
<P>In the chapter before us, this people were thus addre&s;&s;ed by the prophet Micah.</P>
<P>"Hear ye now what the Lord &s;aith: Ari&s;e, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice!"</P>
<P>Or, as the &s;en&s;e is; plead openly, vehemently; let there be witne&s;&s;es to hear the ca&s;e, which is &s;o favourable on God's part, and &s;o full again&s;t his people, that the very mountains and hills, on which they have publickly &s;inned again&s;t him, and on which he greatly ble&s;&s;ed them, had they eyes to &s;ee, ears to hear, and a voice of utterance, would te&s;tify that God planted them with vines and olives; cloathed them with gra&s;s and flocks; &s;tored them with &s;prings of water, and beautified them with cedars and all plea&s;ant trees of the fore&s;t;&mdash;but on the&s;e places have the&s;e people made their groves; &s;et up their idols; &s;acrificed to devils, and com|mitted impieties not to be named! Speak, therefore, O Micah, as though thou woulde&s;t make the mountains and hills hear, that they may witne&s;s for God again&s;t this peo|ple!</P>
<P>"Hear ye, O mountains, the Lord's controver&s;y, and ye &s;trong foundations of the earth; for the Lord hath a con|trover&s;y with his people, and he will plead with I&s;rael;"&mdash; no longer forbear to puni&s;h them for their iniquities.&mdash;"O my people, what have I done unto thee? And wherein have I wearied thee? Te&s;tify again&s;t me!"&mdash;If I have ever been doing thee good; if I have impo&s;ed on thee nothing griev|ous nor unju&s;t, why art thou weary of me? Or, if thou ha&s;t found any inju&s;tice in me, he&s;itate not to declare it; witne&s;s again&s;t me!</P>
<P>The Almighty then recounted the favors he had conferred on the people of I&s;rael, and, particularly, the deliverance he gave them from Egyptian bondage, and from their ene|mies, while pa&s;&s;ing through the wilderne&s;s to the land of Canaan; and al&s;o, the in&s;truction communicated to them by Mo&s;es.</P>
<P>This addre&s;s of the prophet, &s;eems to have awakened in
<PB N="7" REF="021347_0006_0FB31BCD99F4E9A8">
the people a &s;en&s;e of guilt; a di&s;po&s;ition to return to obedi|ence. They enquire what &s;acrifice they &s;hall render God as an atonement for their &s;ins; and expre&s;s their willingne&s;s to offer the <HI>mo&s;t co&s;tly</HI> in their power;&mdash;even the lives of <HI>their</HI> CHILDREN, if <HI>the&s;e</HI> to God would be acceptable.</P>
<P>"Wherewith &s;hall I come before the Lord and bow my|&s;elf before the high God? Shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?&mdash;Will the Lord be plea&s;ed with thou&s;ands of rams? Or with ten thou&s;ands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my fir&s;t-born for my tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion; the fruit of my body for the &s;in of my &s;oul?"</P>
<P>To the&s;e enquiries, the prophet an&s;wers in the words of our text.&mdash;"He HATH &s;hewed thee, O Man! what is GOOD. And what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do ju&s;tly; and to love mercy; and to walk humbly with thy God?"</P>
<P>The Almighty, it is here &s;aid, HAD SHEWED the people of I&s;rael "what was GOOD;" or what was their DUTY.&mdash; It is probable the prophet alluded to the following pa&s;&s;age in the tenth chapter of the book of Deuteronomy, wherein the duty of men is expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>"And now I&s;rael, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God; to walk in all his ways; and to love him; and to &s;erve the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy &s;oul: To keep the com|mandments of the Lord, and his &s;tatutes, which I command thee this day, for thy good?"<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">Deut. x. 12, 13.</NOTE></P>
<P>There are many other pa&s;&s;ages, indeed, in the &s;acred writ|ings, in which the whole of our duty is declared. And the children of I&s;rael were informed, in the text, that all their &s;acrifices to God would be unacceptable to him, if they were <HI>regardle&s;s</HI> of VIRTUE.</P>
<P>"What doth the Lord require of thee but to do ju&s;tly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?" Or, what &s;ervice can&s;t thou render him, that will be accept|able, whil&s;t thou do&s;t not obey his will?</P>
<P>"Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt-offerings and &s;acrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to
<PB N="8" REF="021347_0007_0FB31BCF93BA2FA8">
obey is better than &s;acrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams!"<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. xv. 22.</NOTE></P>
<P>As &s;acrifice, or external wor&s;hip, is not plea&s;ing to God, unle&s;s we are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of righteou&s;ne&s;s;&mdash;and as the WHOLE of our duty con&s;i&s;ts, it is &s;aid, in "doing ju&s;tice; loving mercy, and walking humbly with God;" we beg leave to pay a little attention to the&s;e particulars.</P>
<P>It cannot be &s;aid we "DO JUSTLY," if, in any &s;ort, we <HI>injure</HI> our <HI>fellow creatures.</HI> And, in how many re&s;pects, may they be injured?</P>
<P>They may be robbed of their VIRTUE, which is, of all things, the mo&s;t e&s;timable.</P>
<P>They may be deprived of their REPUTATION; be pierced by the tongue of detraction, and receive thereby a wound more injurious than death it&s;elf.</P>
<P>By artifice, fraud or power, they may be dive&s;ted of their PROPERTY; and, by the hand of violence, they may be <HI>maimed</HI> in their PERSONS, or <HI>deprived</HI> of LIFE.</P>
<P>It cannot be &s;aid, that we "DO JUSTLY," if we are re|gardle&s;s of the duty we owe to <HI>our</HI> COUNTRY, by duly ho|noring IT'S LAWS.</P>
<P>Public ju&s;tice is explicitly enjoined on us. We are re|quired "to render unto all their dues; tribute to whom tribute is due; cu&s;tom to whom cu&s;tom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor."<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiii. 7.</NOTE></P>
<P>Nor can it be &s;aid that we "DO JUSTLY," while we perform not <HI>all</HI> the <HI>relative duties</HI> we owe to <HI>each other.</HI> What inju&s;tice may legi&s;lators, magi&s;trates, mini&s;ters of religion, parents, and divers other characters, be chargeable with, when they are inattentive to the di&s;charge of the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them?</P>
<P>We do not, indeed, properly revere this precept of ju&s;|tice, except we "do unto all men, as we would they &s;hould do unto us;" <NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">Luke vi. 31.</NOTE> or unle&s;s all our actions, towards each other, are governed by the principles of uprightne&s;s and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntegrity.</P>
<P>There is not, we conceive, any virtue that &s;o contributes
<PB N="9" REF="021347_0008_0FB31BD150E47298">
to the happine&s;s of &s;ociety, as JUSTICE. And it is no &s;mall te&s;timony, in favor of our religion, that JUSTICE, as well as MERCY, is &s;o forcibly and repeatedly enjoined on us.</P>
<P>"That," &s;ays God, "which is altogether ju&s;t, &s;halt thou follow."<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">Deut. xvi. 20.</NOTE></P>
<P>"Ye &s;hall not &s;teal; nor deal fal&s;ly; nor lie one to another."<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">Lev. xix. 2.</NOTE></P>
<P>"Thou &s;halt not defraud thy neighbor; nor rob him."<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">ibid. ver. 13.</NOTE></P>
<P>"Ye &s;hall do no unrighteou&s;ne&s;s in judgment; in weight; nor in mea&s;ure. Ju&s;t balances, and ju&s;t weights &s;hall ye have."<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">ibid. ver. 35, 36.</NOTE></P>
<P>"Remove not the ancient land-mar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> which thy fathers have &s;et up.&mdash;Enter not into the fields of the fatherle&s;s; for their Redeemer is mighty, he &s;hall plead their cau&s;e with thee."<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxii. 28. xxiii. 2.</NOTE></P>
<P>"Wo unto him that buildeth his hou&s;e by unrighteou&s;|ne&s;s; that u&s;eth his neighbor's &s;ervice without wages."<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">Jer. xxii. 13.</NOTE></P>
<P>"Let no man defraud his brother, in any matter; be|cau&s;e the Lord is the avenger of all &s;uch."<NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">1 The&s;. iv. 6.</NOTE></P>
<P>To JUSTICE, it is required, that we <HI>add</HI> MERCY.</P>
<P>He who is <HI>truly merciful,</HI> is free from malice, hatred and revenge.&mdash;If injured, "he avengeth not him&s;elf; but rather giveth place to wrath; knowing that vengeance belongeth to God."<NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">Rom. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ii. 19.</NOTE></P>
<P>Such a per&s;on, not only forgives his enemy; forbears "to recompen&s;e to him evil for evil;"<NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">ibid. ver. 17.</NOTE> but, "if he hungers, he feeds him; if he thir&s;ts, he gives him drink,"<NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">ibid. ver. 20.</NOTE> and therefore, "is not overcome of evil, but overcomes evil with good."<NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">ibid. ver. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE></P>
<P>"As he hath opportunity, he doth good to ALL men;" <NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">Gal. vi. 10.</NOTE> "to ALL he is compa&s;&s;ionate, pitiful and courteous;" <NOTE N="(v)" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. iii. 8.</NOTE>&mdash;he u&s;es no &s;everity towards any, though <HI>legal ju&s;tice</HI> might warrant the action.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="021347_0009_0FB31BD2FAA80D60">His deeds of benevolence are not performed to gain hu|man applau&s;e; as far as po&s;&s;ible, they are done in &s;ecret, and he is &s;timulated to them by love to God and love to man.</P>
<P>This is the character that, (in the mo&s;t exalted &s;en&s;e of the expre&s;&s;ion&punc;) may be &s;aid to "LOVE MERCY;" he is, in this in&s;tance, an ornament to human nature and religion, and a ble&s;&s;ing to mankind; and he enjoys a plea&s;ure, in con&s;equence of his benevolence, truly &s;ublime, and alto|gether unexperienced by the man of avarice, hatred or revenge.</P>
<P>We cannot but highly approve our&s;elves to the deity when we "&s;how mercy." And tho&s;e who are devoid of mercy, cannot but be the objects of God's di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>It was &s;aid by our Lord; "If ye forgive men their tre&s;|pa&s;&s;es, your heavenly father will al&s;o forgive you; but if ye forgive not men their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, neither will your heaven|ly father forgive your tre&s;pa&s;&s;es."<NOTE N="(w)" PLACE="foot">Matt. vi. 15.</NOTE></P>
<P>"And he," &s;aith Saint James, "&s;hall have judgment without mercy, that hath &s;hewed no mercy."<NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">Jam. ii. 13.</NOTE></P>
<P>The other particular demanded of us, is, to "WALK HUMBLY WITH GOD;" or to "humble our&s;elves, to walk with him."</P>
<P>HUMILITY certainly becomes <HI>&s;inful men.</HI>&mdash;The p&s;almi&s;t, contemplating the excellence of God, and the depravity of our nature, exclaims: "Lord what is man that thou art mindful of him, and the &s;on of man that thou vi&s;ite&s;t him!"<NOTE N="(y)" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. viii. 4.</NOTE></P>
<P>"Before honor," &s;ays Solomon, "is humility."<NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot">Prov. xv. 33.</NOTE></P>
<P>Our Saviour was a mo&s;t perfect example of humility, and he exhorts us to "learn of him to be meek and lowly in heart."<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Matt. xi. 29.</NOTE></P>
<P>PRIDE, the &s;in of <HI>Lucifer,</HI><NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. iii. 6.</NOTE> is mo&s;t hateful to God; reproachful to men, and will terminate in their aba&s;ement and de&s;truction.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="021347_0010_0FB31BD82694A1F8">"A proud look," we are a&s;&s;ured, "is an abomination to God."<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Prov. vi. 16, 17.</NOTE></P>
<P>"The lofty looks of man," &s;aith a prophet, "&s;hall be humbled, and the haughtine&s;s of man &s;hall be brought down; for the day of the Lord of ho&s;ts &s;hall be upon every one that is lifted up, and he &s;hall be brought low."<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. ii. 11, 12.</NOTE></P>
<P>But however becoming humility is to mankind; and how plea&s;ing &s;oever our humble demeanor may be to God, we cannot conclude that he requires of us nothing more than the virtue of humility, when he enjoins us to "walk humbly with him."</P>
<P>JUSTICE, MERCY, and HUMILITY, are, indeed, <HI>car|dinal virtues;</HI> but &s;hould they, (in the common acceptation of the words) be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by us, we might, notwith&s;tanding, be <HI>defective</HI> in <HI>our duty;</HI> be the &s;laves of vice; polluted by &s;in; devoid of the Almighty's affection.</P>
<P>A per&s;on may be merciful, ju&s;t and humble, while he continues in a <HI>&s;tate of</HI> INFIDELITY; rejects the di&s;pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel; is de&s;titute of &s;obriety; temperance, and cha&s;|tity, and indulges him&s;elf in many vices.</P>
<P>The phraze, therefore, "to walk humbly with God," is very comprehen&s;ive, and is de&s;igned to include here, the <HI>whole of our duty;</HI> except our "doing ju&s;tice and loving mercy."</P>
<P>Agreeable to the tenor of the &s;acred writings, can it be &s;aid that we "walk humbly with God;" perform all our duty, or are entitled to &s;alvation, unle&s;s we give our a&s;&s;ent to the truths of divine revelation;&mdash;are penitent for our &s;ins;&mdash;rely on the merits of Chri&s;t for the ab&s;olution of our offences;&mdash;revere all the divine precepts, to the utmo&s;t of our ability, and are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the graces and virtues of chri&s;tianity; holine&s;s, RENOVATION of HEART, and a meetne&s;s to participate of cele&s;tial enjoyments?</P>
<P>"He that believeth not," &s;ays our Lord, "&s;hall be dam|ned." <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">Mark xvi. 16.</NOTE> It is "the blood of Chri&s;t," we are informed, appropriated to us by faith, "that clean&s;eth us from &s;in."<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">1 John 1.7.</NOTE></P>
<P>Without "repentance," we are a&s;&s;ured we "&s;hall pe|ri&s;h."<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">Luke xiii. 3.</NOTE></P>

<P>Tho&s;e who are the heirs of &s;alvation, or who properly "receive" Chri&s;t, are &s;aid to be "BORN, not of blood; nor of the will of the fle&s;h; nor of the will of man, but <HI>of</HI> GOD."<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">ibid. i. 13.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Such,</HI> "clean&s;e them&s;elves from all filthine&s;s of fle&s;h and &s;pirit, and are perfecting holine&s;s in the fear of God;"<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. vii. 1.</NOTE> and as they are obedient to the dictates of the divine &s;pirit; are influenced and governed by it,&mdash;of THEM, it may be <HI>truly &s;aid,</HI> that THEY "walk humbly WITH God."</P>

<P>Thus <HI>exten&s;ive</HI> and <HI>&s;piritual,</HI> are the demands of our reli|gion; nothing le&s;s than a due regard to <HI>the&s;e things,</HI> can be meant by "fearing God and keeping his commandments;" <NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">Eccl. xii. 13.</NOTE> or, by "doing ju&s;tly; loving mercy, and walking hum|bly with him."</P>
<P>And <HI>&s;uch virtue,</HI> we pre&s;ume, was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by "ENOCH," when "he walked with God;"<NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">Gen. v. 22.</NOTE> by "NOAH, who was a ju&s;t man, and perfect in his generations, when he walked with God, according to all his commandments;"<NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">ibid. vi. 9.</NOTE> and by ABRAHAM, when the Lord appeared to him and &s;aid; "walk before me, and be thou perfect."<NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">Gen. xvii. 1.</NOTE></P>
<P>From what hath been &s;aid, on this intere&s;ting &s;ubject, we perceive how <HI>delu&s;ive</HI> it mu&s;t be, to rely on the external wor&s;hip of God, or on &s;ome moral virtues only, for &s;alva|tion!</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="021347_0012_0FB31BDC92A0A570">The&s;e things are demanded of us; but they are far from comprehending ALL that duty we owe to God, our neigh|bor, and our&s;elves!</P>

<P>And, if thus, we al&s;o perceive how <HI>vain</HI> it mu&s;t be to hope for &s;alvation, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the highe&s;t degrees of FAITH in Chri&s;t, while we are de&s;titute of MORAL GOOD|NESS;&mdash;ju&s;tice; mercy, and humility; &s;incerity, integrity, cha&s;tity, and tho&s;e other virtues, which are required of us!</P>
<P>How grateful &s;hould we be to GOD, that HE HATH "SHEWED US <HI>what is</HI> GOOD;"&mdash;that he hath made a di&s;|covery of his will to us; that we are not left to fruitle&s;s ef|forts to di&s;cover our duty, by the <HI>dim light</HI> of <HI>nature,</HI> but that we are ble&s;t with the perfect effulgence of divine reve|lation!</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WITHOUT attending to that important relation which the&s;e words have with the context, we will con&s;ider in <HI>what &s;en&s;e</HI> Saint Paul was "<HI>alive</HI> without the law."</P>
<P>NEXT, &s;hew, what we are to under&s;tand by the "<HI>coming</HI> of the <HI>commandment</HI>" to him.</P>
<P>And, la&s;tly, the <HI>effects</HI> of <HI>this</HI> to our apo&s;tle;&mdash;"Sin revived, and he died."</P>
<P>FIRST, we are to notice in <HI>what &s;en&s;e</HI> Saint Paul "was <HI>alive</HI> without the law once."</P>
<P>There were three kinds of laws which the Almighty deli|vered to the people of I&s;rael.&mdash;The <HI>ceremonial law,</HI> which pre&s;cribed the rituals of their religion;&mdash;the <HI>judicial law,</HI> by which ju&s;tice was admini&s;tered among them,&mdash;and that law which is <HI>&s;tiled moral,</HI> which enjoined the whole of their duty to God, their neighbors and them&s;elves.&mdash;And it was this la&s;t mentioned law that our apo&s;tle had in view, when he &s;aid, that he was "alive without the law."</P>
<P>Very frequent, in the &s;acred writings, we perceive that a <HI>&s;tate</HI> of SIN or IMPIETY, is compared to a <HI>&s;tate</HI> of DEATH. And al&s;o, that a <HI>return</HI> to VIRTUE, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> RIGH|TEOUSNESS, is compared to LIFE.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="021347_0015_0FB31BE1124A4428">In <HI>this &s;en&s;e</HI> we are to under&s;tand our Lord, when, in the parable of the prodigal &s;on, it is &s;aid; "this my &s;on <HI>was dead,</HI> and <HI>is alive again;</HI> he was lo&s;t, and is found."<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Luke xv. 24.</NOTE></P>
<P>The &s;ame ideas are conveyed by our Saviour in the&s;e words. "I am the re&s;urrection and the life. He that be|lieveth on me, though he <HI>were dead,</HI>&mdash;yet <HI>&s;hall he live.</HI> And who&s;oever <HI>liveth,</HI> and believeth in me, &s;hall <HI>never die;</HI>"<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">John xi. 25.</NOTE> or not eternally peri&s;h.</P>
<P>In &s;uch language, Saint Paul often expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf. In his epi&s;tle to the Romans, he &s;ays; "Likewi&s;e reckon ye al&s;o your&s;elves to be <HI>dead,</HI> indeed, unto &s;in, but <HI>alive</HI> unto God, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord."<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Rom. vi. 11.</NOTE></P>
<P>"Neither yield ye your members as in&s;truments of un|righteou&s;ne&s;s unto &s;in; but yield your&s;elves unto God, as tho&s;e who are <HI>alive</HI> from the <HI>dead.</HI>"<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">ibid. ver. 13.</NOTE></P>
<P>"And you," &s;aid he to the Ephe&s;ians, "hath God <HI>quick|ened,</HI> who <HI>were dead</HI> in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins."<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">Eph. ii. 1.</NOTE></P>
<P>In this &s;ame mode of &s;peech, in the Revelations of Saint John, was the church in Sardis reproved for their declen&s;i|on in goodne&s;s; or defect in righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>"The&s;e things &s;aith he that hath the &s;even &s;pirits of God, and the &s;even &s;tars; I know thy works, that thou ha&s;t a name that thou <HI>live&s;t,</HI> and art dead."<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">Rev. iii. 1.</NOTE></P>
<P>When Saint Paul, therefore, agreeable to this manner of expre&s;&s;ion, "was <HI>alive</HI> without the law,"&mdash;we mu&s;t con|clude that he thought <HI>mo&s;t favourably</HI> of his &s;piritual condi|tion; that he a&s;&s;ured him&s;elf he was in a &s;tate of grace, and an heir of &s;alvation.</P>
<P>At that period, he &s;ays he was "<HI>alive without</HI> the <HI>law;</HI>" &mdash;not without a knowledge of the LETTER of it; but of it's SPIRIT; of it's DEMANDS; the exten&s;ion and purity of it's precepts:&mdash;Or, he then flattered him&s;elf he <HI>duly honored</HI> the law, and was entitled to ju&s;tification before God, through an ob&s;ervance of it's commands.</P>
<P>He was then <HI>"alive;"</HI> free from the terrors of guilt; free from all doubts and fears re&s;pecting his title to immortal happine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="021347_0016_0FB31BE28F80C3E8">At that moment we behold him as a PHARISEE of the <HI>fir&s;t character;</HI> priding him&s;elf in his OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS; &mdash;his &s;trict ob&s;ervance of the Sabbath; his frequent fa&s;tings and deeds of mortification;&mdash;his payment of tythes of all things tythable which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed;&mdash;his zeal for the pro|pagation of the jewi&s;h religion;&mdash;his extraordinary acts of devotion, and alm&s;giving to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>He then could &s;olace him&s;elf with the reflection, that he was not chargeable with any gro&s;s vice; and "thank God that he was not as other men were; extortioners, unju&s;t, adulterers;"<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">Luke xviii. 11.</NOTE> but that, in his own e&s;teem, and in his own words, "as touching the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the law, he was blamele&s;s.<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">Phil. iii. 6.</NOTE></P>
<P>While in this &s;ituation, he was rai&s;ing the &s;uper&s;tructure of his hopes of &s;alvation upon the <HI>un&s;table foundation</HI> of the <HI>merit</HI> of his GOOD WORKS.</P>
<P>Being entirely ignorant of the nece&s;&s;ity of the RIGHTE|OUSNESS of CHRIST, to be appropriated to him <HI>by</HI> FAITH, he was endeavoring to e&s;tabli&s;h his OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS; not attending to this great truth of the go&s;pel, that "CHRIST is the <HI>end</HI> of the <HI>law,</HI> for RIGHTEOUSNESS to every one who <HI>believeth</HI> in him."<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">Rom. x. 4.</NOTE></P>
<P>Thus was Saint Paul in the "wide and broad way, that leadeth to de&s;truction," while he flattered him&s;elf he was in the "&s;trait and narrow path which conducts to &s;alvation!"</P>
<P>Elevated he was to the pinnacle of danger, while he ap|prehended he was re&s;ting on the rock of ages!&mdash;Mo&s;t dan|gerous, indeed, was his &s;ituation; though, to him, plea&s;ing was the delu&s;ion!</P>
<P>Had he been arre&s;ted by the hand of death, while thus tru&s;ting to his <HI>own goodne&s;s,</HI> for acceptance with God,&mdash; how wretched would have been his &s;tate!</P>
<P>But it plea&s;ed the Almighty to behold him in compa&s;&s;ion; to awaken him to a &s;en&s;e of his danger. And this was ef|fected, by the "<HI>coming</HI> of the <HI>commandment</HI>" to his <HI>mind,</HI> through the efficacy of the &s;pirit of grace. "When the <HI>commandment came,</HI> &s;in revived, and I died."</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="021347_0017_0FB31BE40F4A65F0">In &s;trictne&s;s of &s;peech, it may be &s;aid the "command|ment came" to men, when it was delivered by the Almighty to Mo&s;es, on Mount Sinai. But it could not, in this man|ner, come to our apo&s;tle; as the law was given more than fifteen hundred years before he exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>In one &s;en&s;e, it may be &s;aid, "the commandment came" to him, when he was taught it in his youth. But we can|not &s;uppo&s;e the commandment thus came to Saint Paul, a|greeable to his meaning in the text. As he was educated a Phari&s;ee, he, in the early part of his life, became acquainted with the letter of the law;&mdash;but &s;everal years elap&s;ed, after he thus attained a knowledge of the commandment, before he uttered the words before us.</P>
<P>We, therefore, conclude, that when "the commandment came" to him, he beheld it, in ALL its FORCE, EXTENT, and SPIRITUALITY;&mdash;he was <HI>then convinced,</HI> that it was de&s;igned, not only to regulate his <HI>external demeanor,</HI> but to reform, govern, and purify his HEART. He then became &s;en&s;ible of that important truth, inculcated by our Saviour, in his expo&s;ition of the law, that "<HI>out</HI> of the <HI>heart</HI> proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, fal&s;e-witne&s;s, bla&s;phemies."<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">Matt. xv. 19.</NOTE></P>
<P>Our apo&s;tle then beheld the imperfection that attended even his mo&s;t righteous acts, and how far he was from the heavenly kingdom. He then, indeed, had a ju&s;t view of him&s;elf in the gla&s;s of the law; he had an eye to &s;ee that it is "holy, ju&s;t and good;"<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">Rom. vii. 12.</NOTE> to di&s;cern, that it "requires <HI>truth</HI> in the <HI>inward parts,</HI>"<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. li. 6.</NOTE> and he had an ear to hear it's denunciation of divine wrath again&s;t the per&s;on who &s;hall violate even the lea&s;t of its precepts.<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">Gal. iii. 10.</NOTE></P>
<P>When the commandment <HI>thus came</HI> to Saint Paul, the <HI>&s;cene</HI> was <HI>changed;</HI> he was no longer a <HI>proud</HI> PHARISEE; but became an <HI>humble</HI> PENITENT;&mdash;his under&s;tanding was enlightened; the veil of ignorance and delu&s;ion was with|drawn from his eyes; his con&s;cience was alarmed; he felt

<P>Until that period, the viper of iniquity, if we may be in|dulged the &s;imilitude, lay in his brea&s;t, as in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;tate of DEATH;&mdash;but then it became <HI>animated;</HI> it pie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ced him to the heart with its &s;ting; which not only occa&s;ioned pain, but was productive of the pangs of death.</P>

<P>Then tho&s;e deeds of righteou&s;ne&s;s which he regarded as "<HI>gain</HI> to him, he counted," as he &s;ays, "<HI>lo&s;s,</HI> for CHRIST." <NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">Phil. iii. 7.</NOTE>&mdash;Then "he re&s;olved to be found <HI>in Chri&s;t,</HI> not having on his own righteou&s;ne&s;s which was of the law, but that which was <HI>through faith</HI> in the divine Saviour."<NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">ibid. ver&s;. 9.</NOTE>&mdash;And then it was, that "the commandment which was ordained unto LIFE, (to tho&s;e who &s;hould perfectly obey it) he "found," as he him&s;elf expre&s;&s;es it, "to be unto DEATH."<NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">Rom. vii. 10.</NOTE></P>
<P>Happy was it for Saint Paul, that he thus died, that he might live forever!&mdash;From that moment, he felt in him&s;elf the pul&s;e of a &s;piritual life;&mdash;he was delivered from the burthen of &s;in;&mdash;he enjoyed the &s;miles of Heaven;&mdash;he be|came mo&s;t &s;tudious to plea&s;e God;&mdash;he had a ju&s;t dete&s;tati|on of vice;&mdash;his &s;oul was enamoured with the love of vir|tue;&mdash; his affections were &s;upremely fixed on the Almighty, &mdash;he &s;erved him with chearfulne&s;s, and from principle;&mdash; the great object of his pur&s;uit was, the promotion of the glory of God, and the &s;alvation of men;&mdash;his plea&s;ures were holy, and his hopes of redemption, &s;criptural.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="021347_0019_0FB31BE8B7F68DA8">Then it was, indeed, that he "pa&s;&s;ed from death unto life;"<NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">John v. 24.</NOTE>&mdash;that he was "turned from darkne&s;s unto LIGHT; from the power of Satan unto God:"<NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">Acts xxvi. 18.</NOTE>&mdash;And then too it was, to &s;peak in his own language, that he "received the Spirit of adoption, whereby he could cry, Abba, Father;"<NOTE N="(v)" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 15.</NOTE> that "the Spirit it&s;elf bore witne&s;s with his &s;pirit, that he was a child of God; an heir of God, and a joint heir with Chri&s;t of immortal happine&s;s!"<NOTE N="(w)" PLACE="foot">ibid. ver&s;. 16, 17.</NOTE></P>

<P><PB N="21" REF="021347_0020_0FB31BEB8DB12850">From the <HI>religious experience</HI> of SAINT PAUL, that we have noticed; or the progre&s;s of grace in his heart, which he hath left upon record, and no doubt for our &s;piritual ad|vantage, we may make the following practical ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>FIRST: As Saint Paul, even while he was a zealous pro|fe&s;&s;or of religion, and a rigid ob&s;erver of its external duties, was indulging <HI>fallacious hopes</HI> of redemption,&mdash;we may no|tice the propen&s;ity mankind have to entertain <HI>unju&s;t con|ceptions</HI> of their title to &s;alvation; or the probability there is of their <HI>being deceived,</HI> with re&s;pect to their religious &s;tate.</P>
<P>Our apo&s;tle was far from being <HI>&s;ingular,</HI> in this in&s;tance. &mdash;The Jews in general vainly expected to attain &s;alvation by their <HI>imperfect ob&s;ervance</HI> of the precepts of the law; and this occa&s;ioned them to <HI>reject</HI> the RIGHTEOUSNESS of CHRIST.</P>
<P>"But I&s;rael," &s;aith Saint Paul, "which followed after the law of righteou&s;ne&s;s, hath not attained to the law of righte|ou&s;ne&s;s," (or to the righteou&s;ne&s;s that God accepteth.) Wherefore? Becau&s;e, they &s;ought it, <HI>not</HI> by <HI>faith;</HI> but, as it were, by the <HI>works</HI> of the <HI>law;</HI> for they &s;tumbled at that &s;tumbling &s;tone."<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Rom. ix. 31, 32.</NOTE></P>
<P>The law demands a <HI>perfect obedience</HI> of each of its injunc|tions; and as all men are &s;inful, "by the <HI>deeds</HI> of the <HI>law,</HI> therefore, we are a&s;&s;ured, <HI>no fle&s;h</HI> &s;hall be <HI>ju&s;tified</HI> before God;"<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 20.</NOTE> or obtain &s;alvation.</P>
<P>It was the unhappine&s;s of too many of the people of I&s;rael, previous to the promulgation of the go&s;pel, that, in like manner, they were deceiving them&s;elves; &s;aying in their hearts, in the words of the prophet Jeremiah, "Peace, peace, when there was no peace!"<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Jer. vi. 14.</NOTE></P>
<P>And is there not too much rea&s;on to apprehend, that <HI>great numbers,</HI> even of the <HI>profe&s;&s;ors</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> cheri&s;h the &s;ame &s;pirit of <HI>delu&s;ion;</HI> that &s;ome flatter them&s;elves they are the heirs of &s;alvation, by rea&s;on they have felt, perhaps, &s;ome compunction for &s;in; have experienced a partial re|formation of their lives; are ju&s;t in their dealings, and are

ob&s;ervant of the devotional parts of religion?&mdash;That others, willing to magnify the grace of God, promi&s;e them&s;elves immortal happine&s;s, by virtue of their faith only in Chri&s;t, while they are almo&s;t wholly regardle&s;s of his commands?</P>
<P>It cannot rea&s;onably be doubted, but that, in a variety of ways, many per&s;ons countenance erroneous hopes of &s;alva|tion; and, painful is the reflection, it is not improbable, but that great numbers, even leave the world in this &s;tate of <HI>deception!</HI></P>
<P>Our Lord a&s;&s;ures us, that in the day of judgment, many, in vain, will claim a title to &s;alvation. They will &s;ay to him, "Lord! Lord! have we not prophe&s;ied in thy name; in thy name ca&s;t out devils, and in thy name done many wonderful works?" But he will then &s;ay unto them; "I never knew you; depart from me, ye that work iniqui|ty!"<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">Matt. vii. 22, 23.</NOTE></P>
<P>Will it not, therefore, be wi&s;dom in us to regard the a|po&s;tolic council, to "<HI>examine our&s;elves</HI> whether we are in the faith?"<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. xiii. 5.</NOTE></P>
<P>"<HI>Try me,</HI> O God!" &s;aid the P&s;almi&s;t, "and &s;eek the ground of my heart! <HI>prove me,</HI> and <HI>examine</HI> my thoughts! <HI>Look well</HI> if there be any wickedne&s;s in me!"<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. cxxxix. 23, 24.</NOTE></P>
<P>How worthy is <HI>&s;uch conduct</HI> of our <HI>imitation!</HI>&mdash;And mo&s;t true it is, that if we indulge our&s;elves in "any wickedne&s;s," we are not entitled to &s;alvation. "For he," &s;aith St. John, "who is born of God, <HI>&s;inneth not;</HI> but he keepeth him&s;elf and the wicked one toucheth him not!"<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">1 John v. 18.</NOTE></P>
<P>SECONDLY: As "by the law, we are informed, is the <HI>knowledge</HI> of <HI>&s;in;</HI>"<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 20.</NOTE> as "the law, it is &s;aid, is a SCHOOL MASTER to bring us to Chri&s;t,"<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">Gal. iii. 24.</NOTE>&mdash;how grateful &s;hould we be to God, for di&s;pen&s;ing to us the law?</P>
<P>And that it may be in&s;trumental in giving us a proper &s;en&s;e of <HI>&s;in,</HI> we perceive the propriety of <HI>preaching</HI> the LAW, in ALL IT'S EXTENT, PURITY and TERROR.</P>
<P>Thus was it preached by the prophets, by our Lord and
<PB N="23" REF="021347_0022_0FB31BF1A6A99D10">
his apo&s;tles. And never will mankind be properly di&s;po&s;ed to li&s;ten to the invitation of MERCY, offered in the GOSPEL, until they &s;hall &s;uffer them&s;elves to pay due attention to the <HI>voice</HI> of the LAW.</P>
<P>Until Saint Paul did thus, he was <HI>"a live;"</HI> di&s;e&s;teemed the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t; but "when the <HI>commandment came,</HI>" he was &s;en&s;ible of his unhappine&s;s, and duly prized the &s;alvation of the go&s;pel.

<P>THIRDLY: As the law is thus &s;ub&s;ervient to our &s;alva|tion, it &s;hould, on this account, be <HI>highly reverenced</HI> by us.</P>
<P>And we &s;hould al&s;o greatly e&s;teem it, for its moral excel|lence.

<Q><BIBL><HI>2 CORINTHIANS v. 7.</HI></BIBL>
<P>We walk by faith, not by &s;ight.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is no incon&s;iderable recommendation of Chri&s;tianity, that it's benevolent intention is to advance the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> and <HI>future happine&s;s</HI> of mankind. In this life, it affords the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction our nature is capable of; and, at death, opens to our view, the plea&s;ing pro&s;pect of a ble&s;&s;ed im|mortality.</P>
<P>This future felicity, our holy apo&s;tle contemplates; re|flects on with plea&s;ure, and pants after; as we are informed in the beginning of the chapter we have named. "For we know," &s;ays he, "that if our earthly hou&s;e of this taber|nacle were di&s;&s;olved, we have a building of God; an hou&s;e not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. For in this we groan earne&s;tly, de&s;iring rather to be cloathed upon with our hou&s;e which is from heaven."</P>
<P>Saint Paul then a&s;cribes the a&s;pirations which Chri&s;tians have after immortal happine&s;s, and their capability to par|ticipate of cele&s;tial joys, to the <HI>influences</HI> of the divine SPI|RIT.&mdash;"Now he that hath wrought us for the &s;elf-&s;ame thing is God, who hath given us the <HI>earne&s;t</HI> of his SPI|RIT."</P>
<P>Our apo&s;tle next con&s;iders the profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity, while here, as in a &s;tate of pilgrimage, and, in the words be|fore us, mentions what it is that directs their &s;teps; <HI>governs,</HI> and <HI>influences them</HI> in this world. "We <HI>walk by</HI> FAITH: not by &s;ight."</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="021347_0025_0FB31BF62A3849E0">As, in the&s;e words, it is declared, that FAITH <HI>directs</HI> our <HI>conduct;</HI> and as <HI>great virtue</HI> is <HI>a&s;cribed</HI> to <HI>faith,</HI> in the &s;a|cred writings, we will beg leave to attend to it's <HI>nature,</HI> and to regard the truth, that it is <HI>"by faith,"</HI> the &s;incere profe&s;|&s;ors of the go&s;pel <HI>"walk,"</HI> and <HI>"not by &s;ight."</HI></P>
<P>Faith, <HI>in general,</HI> may be &s;aid to be a per&s;ua&s;ion of the truth of tho&s;e things, of which we are <HI>informed,</HI> but of which we have <HI>no ocular</HI> nor <HI>&s;en&s;ible demon&s;tration.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;uch is the nature of faith, it may pertain to the things which are of <HI>this world,</HI> as well as of the <HI>world above;</HI> or, it may be &s;aid, there is a faith which is <HI>earthly,</HI> and that which is <HI>heavenly,</HI> or <HI>religious.</HI></P>
<P>The objects of <HI>earthly faith,</HI> are <HI>innumerable:</HI> What men of di&s;tingui&s;hed character; what cities; what kingdoms; what empires have exi&s;ted, and do now exi&s;t, at a di&s;tance from us?&mdash;How many events have happened? What changes have there been in the natural and political world? How numerous, indeed, are the things, of which we are inform|ed, but which are not within the circle of our ob&s;ervation?</P>
<P>The objects of <HI>religious faith,</HI> are al&s;o <HI>many.</HI> They include the being of a God, and all his attributes, as revealed to us in the holy &s;criptures; the plurality of per&s;ons in the God|head, the Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t; the formation of the univer&s;e;&mdash;divine providence;&mdash;the economy of our redemption, as exhibited in the go&s;pel;&mdash;the immortality of our &s;ouls;&mdash;the re&s;urrection of our bodies;&mdash;the di&s;&s;olution of the world;&mdash;a day of judgment;&mdash;everla&s;ting rewards or puni&s;hments, according to our actions in the pre&s;ent &s;tate.</P>
<P>Or, in other words, the objects of this faith, are <HI>all</HI> the doctrines and precepts; promi&s;es and threatnings, and par|ticulars contained in the &s;acred writings.</P>
<P>In <HI>one &s;en&s;e,</HI> when we give our a&s;&s;ent to the truths of di|vine Revelation, it may be &s;aid, we are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of <HI>faith;</HI> but as the &s;criptures enumerate &s;everal kinds of faith, it will be proper to notice them, that we may have a ju&s;t appre|hen&s;ion of that faith, which is e&s;&s;ential to our &s;alvation.</P>
<P>Does a per&s;on <HI>believe</HI> the <HI>go&s;pel?</HI> Does he take upon him the Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion?</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="021347_0026_0FB31BF7E5990FA0">But does he <HI>continue in his &s;ins;</HI> a &s;lave of vice?&mdash;Is his faith <HI>uninfluential</HI> on his conduct; is it merely &s;peculative?</P>
<P>If thus, it is <HI>not</HI> the faith &s;pecified in the text;&mdash;but that which Saint James alludes to, when be &s;ays; "Shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will &s;hew thee my faith by my works; Thou believe&s;t there is one God; thou do&s;t well; the devils al&s;o believe and tremble. But wilt thou know, O vain man, the <HI>faith without works is dead?</HI>"<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">James ii. 19, 20.</NOTE>&mdash;Unavailable; in&s;ufficient to thy &s;alvation.</P>
<P>A &s;ect of <HI>libertine Chri&s;tians,</HI> (the di&s;ciples of Simon Magus, termed Gno&s;ticks) aro&s;e in the days of the apo&s;tles; they pretended to extraordinary illuminations from Heaven, and taught that nothing more was required of men to obtain &s;alvation, than <HI>faith only,</HI> in Chri&s;t; and thus they encour|aged the <HI>mo&s;t licentious practices.</HI></P>
<P>Saint James confutes their impious doctrine; evinces the nece&s;&s;ity of moral goodne&s;s, as the fruits of faith, and affirms, that "as the body without the &s;pirit is dead; &s;o faith, without works, is dead al&s;o.<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">ibid. ver&s;. 26.</NOTE></P>
<P>Our Lord, in the parable of the Sower, &s;peaks of a faith that is <HI>temporary.</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have it, "hear the word with joy; they receive the go&s;pel, even with rapture, and make a &s;plendid profe&s;&s;i|on of virtue; but not being e&s;tabli&s;hed in goodne&s;s, "they believe for <HI>a while</HI> and in time of temptation <HI>fall away;</HI>"<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Matt. viii. 13.</NOTE> &mdash;they are &s;uch as "put the hand to the plough and <HI>look back;</HI>"<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">Luke ix. 62.</NOTE> in the words of Saint Paul, they "make &s;hip|wreck of faith and a good con&s;cience;"<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. i. 19.</NOTE>&mdash;or "ca&s;t off their fir&s;t faith."<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. v. 12.</NOTE></P>
<P>This temporary faith, as well as that which is merely &s;pe|culative, we have too often <HI>exemplified</HI> among the profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity. It is a &s;erious truth, indeed, that va&s;t num|bers of tho&s;e who a&s;&s;ume the Chri&s;tian name, are, in no &s;ort, or, but very little influenced by their faith, to the re|proach of Chri&s;tianity, and to the great increa&s;e of their guilt!</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="021347_0027_0FB31BF9CD0822C8">The holy &s;criptures al&s;o mention a faith by which <HI>mira|cles were wrought.</HI></P>
<P>The apo&s;tles performed miracles, but, as they acknow|ledged, not by their own power, but by virtue of their faith in Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Saint Peter gave healing to an object of di&s;tre&s;s, a cripple from his infancy, "who was daily laid at the beautiful gate of the temple," to excite charity from the benevolent. When the multitude &s;aw the man "walking, leaping and prai&s;ing God, they were filled with wonder and amazement." And unto them, &s;aid the apo&s;tle, "Why marvel ye at this? Or why look ye &s;o earne&s;tly on us, as though, by our own pow|er, or holine&s;s, we had made this man to walk? The God of our Fathers hath glorified his Son Je&s;us, whom ye deli|vered up.

<P>Such faith &s;ome men may have had, who did not obtain &s;alvation; for our Lord a&s;&s;ures us, that many who &s;hall have "prophe&s;ied in his name; and in his name &s;hall have ca&s;t out Devils, and done many wonderful works," &s;hall, at la&s;t, be rejected by him, becau&s;e they were "workers of iniqui|ty."<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">Matt. vii. 22, 23.</NOTE> "And," &s;aith Saint Paul, "though I have the gift of prophecy, and under&s;tand all my&s;teries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith; &s;o that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing."<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xiii. 2.</NOTE></P>
<P>The &s;acred writings likewi&s;e mention tho&s;e who <HI>had faith</HI> to <HI>rely</HI> on the <HI>power</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to <HI>work miracles.</HI></P>
<P>"Speak the word only," &s;aid the Centurion to Chri&s;t, "and my &s;ervant &s;hall be healed." "As thou ha&s;t believ|ed," it was an&s;wered by our Saviour, "&s;o be it done unto thee."<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">Matt. viii. 8, 13.</NOTE></P>
<P>"A woman of Canaan," we are informed, &s;olicited Chri&s;t in behalf of her daughter, who was "grievou&s;ly vexed with a Devil." "O woman," &s;aid our Lord to her, "great is thy faith! Be it unto thee even as thou wilt."<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">Matt. xv. 22, 28.</NOTE></P>

<P>As it often happened that &s;uch per&s;ons died before the bi&s;hop could attend them for this purpo&s;e, to prevent this inconvenience, as far as po&s;&s;ible, the canons, in &s;ome places, required that bi&s;hops &s;hould vi&s;it their dioce&s;is annually; and if they were &s;o exten&s;ive that this could not be effected, their dioce&s;is were to be reduced into &s;maller di&s;tricts.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Se Bingham's Antiquities, Vol. I.

<P>It is required, by our church, that tho&s;e to <HI>be confirmed,</HI> &s;hall have arrived to years of di&s;cretion, and attained a know|ledge

of the e&s;&s;ential doctrines of Chri&s;tianity; under&s;tand the nature of this in&s;titution, and receive it with freedom and deliberation.</P>
<P>Our catechi&s;m is &s;tiled "An in&s;truction to be learned of every per&s;on, before he be brought to be confirmed by the bi&s;hop;"&mdash;which is appointed to be done, "&s;o &s;oon as he can &s;ay the Creed, the Lord's prayer, and the ten command|ments, in the vulgar tongue, and be farther in&s;tructed in the church catechi&s;m, &s;et forth for that purpo&s;e."</P>
<P>The preface to our office of confirmation, very clearly expre&s;&s;es the knowledge that is demanded of tho&s;e who &s;hall be confirmed, and declares al&s;o, the nature and end of confir|mation. After reading of which, the following very &s;erious and important que&s;tion is addre&s;&s;ed to tho&s;e who wi&s;h to be confirmed.</P>
<P>"Do ye here, in the pre&s;ence of God, and of this con|gregation, <HI>renew</HI> the &s;olemn promi&s;e and vow that was made in your name at your bapti&s;m; <HI>ratifying</HI> and <HI>confirming</HI> the &s;ame in your <HI>own per&s;ons,</HI> and acknowledging your&s;elves <HI>bound</HI> to believe, and do all tho&s;e things which your God-fathers and God-mothers then undertook for you?"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It cannot, we imagine, be <HI>improper</HI> for tho&s;e members of our churches to be <HI>confirmed</HI> who have arrived even to <HI>old age,</HI> and who have not had an opportunity to &s;ubmit to this holy rite.</P>
<P>Very probably, the greater number of &s;uch per&s;ons, were baptized in their <HI>infancy,</HI> and with re&s;pect to <HI>the&s;e,</HI> there are the <HI>&s;ame rea&s;ons</HI> to be offered why <HI>they</HI> &s;hould be <HI>confirmed,</HI> as <HI>tho&s;e</HI> in <HI>youth.</HI> Indeed, &s;uch per&s;ons who are advanced in life, &s;hould, we conceive, with <HI>alacrity,</HI> embrace the <HI>fir&s;t opportunity</HI> to partake of the benefits of confirmation.</P>
<P>And <HI>&s;uch too,</HI> we apprehend, &s;hould be the conduct of tho&s;e <HI>communicants</HI> among us, who have <HI>not</HI> been con|firmed.</P>
<P>The holy <HI>&s;acrament</HI> of the <HI>Lord's &s;upper,</HI> is entirely di&s;|tinct from the &s;acred rite of <HI>confirmation,</HI> and was in&s;tituted to an&s;wer a <HI>very different end,</HI> viz. to maintain in us a lively &s;en&s;e of <HI>gratitude</HI> for the death and pa&s;&s;ion of our Saviour. How different is <HI>this</HI> from the <HI>&s;olemn dedication</HI> of our&s;elves to GOD; the <HI>ratification</HI> of our <HI>bapti&s;mal vows</HI> and <HI>promi&s;es,</HI> in confirmation?</P>
<P>As it was not intended that the <HI>reception</HI> of the <HI>euchari&s;t</HI> &s;hould <HI>relea&s;e</HI> us from an <HI>ob&s;ervance</HI> of the <HI>&s;acrament</HI> of <HI>bap|ti&s;m,</HI> we can di&s;cern <HI>no rea&s;on</HI> why <HI>&s;uch</HI> an act &s;hould <HI>free</HI> us from a <HI>&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion</HI> to <HI>that rite</HI> which is a <HI>recognition</HI> and <HI>confir|mation</HI> of our <HI>bapti&s;m.</HI></P>
<P>He who <HI>communicates,</HI> performs an act of devotion; ex|pre&s;&s;es his thankfulne&s;s for the death of Chri&s;t; acknow|ledges his belief in him, and obligations to revere his precepts. And does not the <HI>non-communicant</HI> THUS, when he repeats the Creeds, and joins in the Liturgy of our church?</P>
<P>But as neither of the&s;e per&s;ons, by &s;uch conduct, <HI>for|mally</HI> takes on him&s;elf his <HI>bapti&s;mal obligations,</HI> no &s;ufficient rea&s;on, we pre&s;ume, can be rendered, why <HI>both</HI> of them &s;hould <HI>not be confirmed,</HI> if they have not received confirm|ation.</P>
<P>As <HI>this</HI> is an in&s;titution of our church; as it is, in it&s;elf, <HI>mo&s;t &s;olemn</HI> and <HI>edifying,</HI> and cannot, with the <HI>lea&s;t impro|priety,</HI> be regarded by any <HI>worthy communicant,</HI> for the &s;ake of EXAMPLE, if for <HI>no other end,</HI> communicants, we are of opinion, would act with <HI>piety</HI> and <HI>wi&s;dom,</HI> &s;hould they <HI>honor</HI> this <HI>&s;acred rite.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Such,</HI> we are happy to mention, hath been the conduct of communicants in general, of the CLERGY, as well as of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ragations, in the &s;tates of <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> (and we know not but in the other &s;tates.) wherein this rite <HI>hath been</HI> admini&s;tered; and <HI>hereby,</HI> they have <HI>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ed</HI> their <HI>di&s;po&s;ition</HI> to <HI>regard</HI> ALL the <HI>ordinances</HI> of their church; to be <HI>con&s;i&s;tent</HI> epi&s;copalians; to <HI>"fulfil all righteou&s;ne&s;s."</HI></P></NOTE></P>

<P><PB N="41" REF="021347_0039_0FB31C12A958F9E8">As in this ordinance we &s;o fully recognize our bapti&s;mal obligations, and &s;o &s;olemnly dedicate our&s;elves to the &s;ervice of God, we, therefore, perceive that <HI>confirmation</HI> obviates &s;everal of the objections made to <HI>infant bapti&s;m,</HI> and greatly enervates the plea of nece&s;&s;ity, of tho&s;e who deny it's validi|ty, for <HI>rebaptizing</HI> &s;uch as were baptized in their infancy.</P>
<P>It is worthy of ob&s;ervation, that, in the <HI>Jewi&s;h church,</HI> a practice prevailed, which, to the Jews, was &s;omething &s;imi|lar to confirmation, with us.</P>
<P>An author of eminence mentions, "That, in the Jewi&s;h church, when a child attained the age of thirteen years, the father, having taught him the principles of his religion, pre|&s;ented him, in a &s;acred a&s;&s;embly, to undertake, in his own per&s;on, to become a &s;on of the precept;&mdash;that is, one who takes upon him&s;elf, from that period, obedience to the law of God, and to an&s;wer for his &s;ins; and that, thereafter, prayer was made for his improvement in grace."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Buxtorf.

<P>It mu&s;t be acknowledged that <HI>this ceremony,</HI> with great propriety, followed the rite of <HI>circumci&s;ion;</HI> which was a fi|gure of <HI>bapti&s;m;</HI> as was the pa&s;chal-&s;upper, a &s;ymbol of the euchari&s;t.</P>
<P>The impo&s;ition of hands and prayer, by the bi&s;hop, always attended confirmation; and it was cu&s;tomary to anoint tho&s;e who were confirmed with oil, to denote that heavenly unction that was received by them from above;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Bingham's antiquities, Vol. I, Fol. 535, 536&punc;</NOTE> but this practice hath been di&s;continued by the church, &s;ince the mi|raculous gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t have cea&s;ed to be conferred in confirmation.</P>
<P>The &s;anctifying and more ordinary influences, however, of the divine Spirit, may rea&s;onably be expected to be com|municated, when this rite is duly admini&s;tered.

<P><HI>Saint Augu&s;tin</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This learned and pious Father was born in 355. Lives of the Fathers, Vol. II.

<P>It is ob&s;erved, by a celebrated author, "That though men have not in confirmation, the gift of tongues conferred on them, as in the days of the apo&s;tles, they may, notwith&s;tand|ing, have other gifts, &s;ufficient to te&s;tify the pre&s;ence of the divine Spirit; and al&s;o, to entitle the act of the impo&s;ition of hands to the dignity of an apo&s;tolic in&s;titution."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Bingham's Antiquities, Vol. I.

<P>As bapti&s;m, in the primitive church, <HI>preceded</HI> confirma|tion; &s;o this rite was admini&s;tered, <HI>previous</HI> to the reception of the Lord's &s;upper; and this practice is enjoined by our church.</P>
<P>It was the general cu&s;tom of the church, in the fir&s;t ages of chri&s;tianity, for tho&s;e who were <HI>confirmed, immediately</HI> to <HI>partake</HI> of the EUCHARIST. If, however, there were any who had received confirmation, but <HI>did not communicate,</HI> they were, on that account, expo&s;ed to the <HI>cen&s;ures</HI> of the church, which were &s;evere.</P>

<P>Without quoting any thing more from the ancients, on this &s;ubject, it may not be altogether &s;uperfluous to ob&s;erve, that in 1691, Sir PETER KING, afterwards LORD CHAN|CELLOR of England, publi&s;hed his celebrated book, entitled, "An Enquiry into the con&s;titution, di&s;cipline, unity and wor&s;hip of the primitive church, that flouri&s;hed within the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> 300 <HI>years</HI> after Chri&s;t, faithfully collected out of the extant writings of tho&s;e ages, by an impartial hand." And that, in this work, he more than once mentions, that the <HI>rite</HI> of <HI>confirmation</HI> was regarded by the <HI>primitive church;</HI> Page 83, 84, 88.</P>
<P>A church, or dioce&s;s, in the valies of <HI>Piedmont,</HI> from the days of the apo&s;tles, to the period of the reformation, pre|&s;erved a <HI>very con&s;iderable degree of purity,</HI> both in <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>manners.</HI> See <HI>Dr. Allix's</HI> remarks on the hi&s;tory of the <HI>ancient churches</HI> of <HI>Piedmont.</HI> And <HI>Mo&s;heim's</HI> Eccle&s;. Hi&s;t. Vol. II. Page 452. [Note g.] It appears from <HI>the&s;e remarks</HI> of <HI>Dr. Allix,</HI> page 8. that the church of Piedmont, in it's <HI>very early &s;tate,</HI> admini&s;tered <HI>confirmation</HI> to tho&s;e who were baptized.</P>
<P>The doctrines of that di&s;tingui&s;hed reformer, PETER WALDUS who lived in the twelfth century, with incredi|ble rapidity, though greatly oppo&s;ed, diffu&s;ed it&s;elf through Europe. In 1504, the <HI>WALDENSES,</HI> in their confe&s;&s;ion of faith exhibited to <HI>Uladi&s;laus,</HI> king of Hungary, &s;peak thus with re&s;pect to the rite of confirmation.</P>
<P>"We confe&s;s, with a <HI>faith</HI> taken out of the <HI>divine &s;crip|tures,</HI> that, in the times of the apo&s;tles, this was ob&s;erved. Tho&s;e, who being come to the ripene&s;s of years, and who had not received the promi&s;ed gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t, re|ceived them afterwards by prayer and <HI>impo&s;ition of hands,</HI> for the <HI>confirmation</HI> of the faith. The &s;ame we think al&s;o of <HI>infants.</HI>" Confe&s;&s;. Walden&s;. de Confirm.</P>
<P>In their apology to the <HI>Marque&s;s</HI> of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> in 1532, adverting to infants who have been baptized, they &s;ay: "That when they &s;hall have come to years of di&s;cre|tion, and under&s;tand the faith, and begin truly to love Chri&s;t, we bring them to the profe&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e things, even what|&s;oever they have attained to by the help of their parents, or godfathers, or by the mini&s;try of the church, that they may them&s;elves, of their own accord, mo&s;t freely own and profe&s;s all tho&s;e things before the whole church, to their own &s;al|vation, in the celebration of the <HI>rite</HI> of <HI>impo&s;ition of hands;</HI> which being done, they are <HI>confirmed.</HI> And there is forth|with given them full power and right to <HI>communicate</HI> of the body and blood of Chri&s;t, with the faithful." Apolog. Part IV.</P>
<P>The BOHEMIAN BRETHREN, (a remnant of the <HI>Sla|vonique church,</HI> and the di&s;ciples of <HI>Wickliffe, Hu&s;s</HI> and <HI>Je|rome</HI> of Prague) thus de&s;cribe their mode of admini&s;tering confirmation, by their <HI>bi&s;hop,</HI> COMENIUS.</P>
<P>"The young ones," &s;aith he, "having been taught the heads of religion at home, by their parents and &s;ureties; or at &s;chool, by their ma&s;ters, are publickly delivered to the care of their pa&s;tors in the church, before the reception of the Lord's &s;upper, mo&s;t u&s;ually at the time of pa&s;toral vi&s;i|tation, after this manner:</P>
<P N="1">I. The words of Chri&s;t, Matt. xi. 28. "Come unto me all that labour," &amp;c. are read, with a &s;hort explication of them.</P>
<P N="2">II. The youth of both &s;exes, appointed thereunto and pre|examined by the pa&s;tor, are placed in order in the middle of the church.</P>
<P N="3">III. Then they are a&s;ked, whether they will <HI>renew</HI> the covenant they entered into with God at bapti&s;m?</P>
<P N="4">IV. This being con&s;ented to by them, the heads of the covenant are explained, according to the form pre&s;cribed by the apo&s;tle to Titus, Chap. ii. 11, 12, 13. "Denying un|godline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts; to live righteou&s;ly, &s;oberly, and godly in this pre&s;ent world; looking for the ble&s;&s;ed hope," &amp;c. And they are required openly, before the church, to renounce the world, the devil and the fle&s;h, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="5">V. Next, a profe&s;&s;ion of faith is demanded of them, &s;o that they all repeat aloud the apo&s;tles creed.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Then, on their knees, &s;aying after the mini&s;ter, they pray unto God, to forgive the &s;ins of their youth, and &s;trengthen them by his holy &s;pirit, unto all the good purpo&s;e of his will; which al&s;o the whole a&s;&s;embly doth, praying for them. After the prayers,</P>
<P N="7">VII. There is a declaration, to the&s;e young di&s;ciples, of their right to participate of the Lord's &s;upper.</P>
<P>And, la&s;tly, there is added the <HI>apo&s;tolical rite of impo&s;ition of hands,</HI> with the invocation of the name of God upon them, to &s;trengthen, (or confirm) the hope of his heavenly grace."</P>
<P>The LEIDEN DIVINES, (in their &s;ynop&s;is pueroris the|ologiae, Di&s;. xlvii.) ob&s;erve, "That it is probable this doc|trine of <HI>impo&s;ition of hands,</HI> is referred to that care of the <HI>ancient church,</HI> whereby children, in&s;tructed in catechetical doctrine, before they were admitted to partake of the Lord's &s;upper, were pre&s;ented to the church, to an&s;wer concerning the faith, and commended by prayer unto God, the <HI>rite of impo&s;ition of hands</HI> being added thereunto; which was a ge&s;ture of tho&s;e who pray and ble&s;s, even from the time of the patriarchs."</P>
<P>CHEMNITIUS, a <HI>Lutheran</HI> clergyman of eminence, &s;ays; "Our divines have often &s;hewed, that the <HI>rite</HI> of <HI>confirma|tion</HI> (unprofitable, &s;uper&s;titious, and anti-&s;criptural traditions, being removed from it) might be piou&s;ly u&s;ed, and to the edi|fication of the church, according to the <HI>con&s;ent</HI> of <HI>&s;cripture,</HI> after this manner, viz. That tho&s;e who have been baptized in their infancy, when come to years of di&s;cretion, &s;hould be diligently in&s;tructed in a certain and plain catechi&s;m, of the doctrine of the church; and when they &s;eem competent|ly to have under&s;tood the principles of it, &s;hould afterwards be pre&s;ented to the bi&s;hop and church; and there the child that was baptized in infancy, &s;hould,</P>

<P N="4">IV. He &s;hould be put in mind, and declare by this pro|fe&s;&s;ion, how he differs from all heathen, heretical, fanatic, and profane opinions.</P>
<P N="5">V There &s;hould be added, a grave and &s;erious exhortation, out of the word of God; that he &s;hould per&s;evere in good|ne&s;s, and by going forward therein, be farther confirmed in the covenant of bapti&s;m, and in that doctrine and faith. And next.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Public prayer &s;hould be made for tho&s;e children, that God, by his holy &s;pirit, would vouch&s;afe to govern, pre&s;erve and confirm them, in this profe&s;&s;ion; Whereunto, without &s;uper&s;tition, may be added <HI>impo&s;ition of hands.</HI> Nor would that prayer be vain; for it is warranted by the promi&s;es con|cerning the gift of per&s;everance, and grace of confirmation."</P>
<P>"Such a <HI>rite</HI> of <HI>confirmation,</HI>" adds this author, "would very much profit youth, and the whole church; for it would be <HI>agreeable</HI> both to <HI>&s;cripture</HI> and <HI>pure antiquity.</HI>" Exam. Concil. Trident. part II. de Confirm.</P>

<P>THE &s;acraments of chri&s;tianity were ordained in com|pa&s;&s;ion to the weakne&s;s of our nature; they are but few in number, <HI>bapti&s;m,</HI> and the <HI>Lord's &s;upper;</HI> and, when duly regarded, are attended with very e&s;&s;ential advantages.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent permit us to pay a little attention to the la&s;t-mentioned of the&s;e ordinances now before us, which was in&s;tituted by our Saviour, but a &s;hort time before his pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In di&s;cour&s;ing on this &s;acrament, we will,</P>
<P>FIRST, Explain it's nature.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, Shew the obligations we are under to ob|&s;erve this in&s;titution.</P>

<P>LASTLY, We will pay attention to &s;ome of tho&s;e parti|culars which prevent many from receiving this ordinance.</P>
<P>FIRST, we are to explain the nature of the &s;acrament of the Lord's &s;upper.</P>
<P>Though &s;ome authors have greatly <HI>perplexed</HI> and <HI>embarra&s;&s;|ed</HI> this &s;ubject, we apprehend it is, in it&s;elf, <HI>extremely &s;imple;</HI> and that it may be fully, and clearly explained in a few words.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="021347_0061_0FB31C429261D750">Properly to under&s;tand this chri&s;tian rite, it will be nece&s;|&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that it was <HI>typified</HI> under the Jewi&s;h eco|nomy.</P>
<P>The <HI>pa&s;chal &s;upper</HI> was in&s;tituted to maintain in the minds of the Jews, a &s;en&s;e of the goodne&s;s of God in <HI>pre&s;erving</HI> them <HI>from death,</HI> when the de&s;troying angel flew the Fir&s;t-born, in every dwelling of the Egyptians.&mdash;That the Jewi&s;h pa&s;&s;over was ordained to <HI>effect this purpo&s;e,</HI> is very evident from the words of it's in&s;titution, which are contained in the twelfth chapter of the book of Exodus.</P>
<P>"Then Mo&s;es called for all the elders of I&s;rael, and &s;aid unto them; draw out and take unto you a lamb, according to your families, and kill the pa&s;&s;over. And ye &s;hall take a bunch of hy&s;op, and dip it into the blood that is in the ba&s;on, and &s;trike the lintel, and the two &s;ide-po&s;ts, with the blood that is in the ba&s;on; and none of you &s;hall go out at the door of his hou&s;e until the morning. For the Lord will pa&s;s through to &s;mite the Egyptians, and when he &s;eeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two &s;ide-po&s;ts, the Lord will pa&s;s over the door, and will not &s;uffer the de&s;troyer to come unto your hou&s;es to &s;mite you. And ye &s;hall ob&s;erve this thing for an ordinance to thee, and to thy &s;ons, for ever. And it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, when ye be come to the land which the Lord will give you, according as he hath promi&s;|ed, that ye &s;hall keep this &s;ervice. And it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, when your children &s;hall &s;ay unto you; what mean you by this &s;ervice? That ye &s;hall &s;ay, it is the &s;acrifice of the Lord's pa&s;&s;over, who pa&s;&s;ed over the hou&s;es of the children of I&s;rael in Egypt, when he <HI>&s;mote</HI> the Egyptians and <HI>deliver|ed our hou&s;es.</HI>"</P>
<P>That this event was typical of a much greater deliverance that mankind &s;hould receive, even a <HI>deliverance from eternal death,</HI> by virtue of the &s;acrifice of Chri&s;t; and that the pa&s;|chal lamb was a figure of our Saviour, is manife&s;t from di|vers pa&s;&s;ages of &s;acred writ.</P>

<P>It is worthy of ob&s;ervation, that our Saviour con&s;tantly celebrated the Jewi&s;h pa&s;&s;over at Jeru&s;alem, (and when only twelve years old, we are informed, he repaired to that city for this purpo&s;e<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Luke ii. 42.</NOTE> until he aboli&s;hed this rite, by in&s;tituting another ordinance in it's place.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t before his death, he &s;aid to his apo&s;tles; "With de|&s;ire I have de&s;ired to eat this pa&s;&s;over with you, before I &s;uf|fer. For I &s;ay unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until IT be <HI>fulfilled</HI> in the <HI>kingdom</HI> of GOD;"&mdash;or, as we conceive, the &s;en&s;e is: 'I will no more partake of this or|dinance; <HI>that</HI> which IT <HI>typified,</HI> will &s;oon be <HI>accompli&s;hed</HI> in the <HI>&s;piritual kingdom</HI> I have e&s;tabli&s;hed; and, after my re&s;urrection, I will, <HI>in &s;pirit,</HI> be <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> with &s;uch worthy members of my church, as &s;hall a&s;&s;emble to commemorate my pa&s;&s;ion, and rejoice, with them, in the happy fruits and effects of my &s;ufferings.'</P>
<P>That Saint Paul apprehended the pa&s;chal lamb, was an <HI>emblem</HI> of the &s;acrifice of Chri&s;t, is very evident from the en|&s;uing exhortation to the church at Corinth. "CHRIST our <HI>pa&s;&s;over</HI> is <HI>&s;acrificed for us;</HI> therefore, let us keep the

fea&s;t; not with old leaven; neither with the leaven of ma|lice and wickedne&s;s; but with the unleavened bread of &s;ince|rity and truth."</P>
<P>As the <HI>principal intention</HI> of the Jewi&s;h pa&s;&s;over, was, as hath been noticed, to occa&s;ion the I&s;raelites, ever to be <HI>grate|ful</HI> to God for that &s;ignal in&s;tance of his goodne&s;s, in pre|&s;erving them from <HI>death,</HI> when the fir&s;t born of the Egyp|tians were &s;lain;&mdash;&s;o the <HI>primary intention</HI> of the chri&s;tian pa&s;&s;over, or of the &s;acrament of the Lord's &s;upper, is, to pre|&s;erve in our minds a <HI>lively &s;en&s;e</HI> of <HI>gratitude</HI> for the &s;ufferings of our Saviour, to deliver us from <HI>death eternal.</HI></P>
<P>"This do, in <HI>remembrance</HI> of <HI>me.</HI>"</P>
<P>As if our Lord &s;hould have &s;aid, 'this bread, by me brok|en, and given to you, repre&s;ents my body, which I &s;hall now give to be broken on the Cro&s;s for your redemption; often thus break bread, and partake of it, that you may not be <HI>un|mindful</HI> of my &s;ufferings; but always <HI>retain &s;entiments</HI> of gra|titude for that te&s;timony I &s;hall give you of my affection;&mdash; the purcha&s;e of your &s;alvation, at the expence of my death and pa&s;&s;ion.'</P>
<P>Such, we pre&s;ume, is the <HI>nature</HI> of this &s;acrament. We proceed,</P>
<P>SECONDLY, to con&s;ider the <HI>obligations</HI> we are under to <HI>regard it.</HI></P>
<P>As the Jewi&s;h pa&s;&s;over was a type of this ordinance; the former, the &s;hadow, of which the latter, is the &s;ub&s;tance, we may rationally conclude, from <HI>this con&s;ideration,</HI> that this &s;a|crament is <HI>mo&s;t forcibly</HI> enjoined on us by divine authority; as the people of I&s;rael were po&s;itively commanded to ob&s;erve the pa&s;&s;over; and, indeed, upon their non-ob&s;ervance of it, without a ju&s;t rea&s;on, they were to be <HI>put to death.</HI> "The man," it is written, "that is clean; and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the pa&s;&s;over, even the &s;ame &s;oul &s;hall be <HI>cut off</HI> from his people."</P>
<P>The <HI>authority</HI> of our LORD to <HI>in&s;titute &s;acraments</HI> is <HI>un|que&s;tionable;</HI> for "all power was given to him in Heaven and in earth."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxviii. 18.</NOTE> And can any command be <HI>more explicit,</HI>
<PB N="67" REF="021347_0064_0FB31C48DE22C478">
than <HI>that</HI> which enjoins on us this &s;acrament? "THIS DO, in remembrance of me."</P>
<P>This &s;ervice, it may be remarked, is farther enjoined on us, not only by the <HI>example</HI> of the <HI>primitive church,</HI> but al&s;o, by the words of Saint Paul.</P>
<P>"For I have received of the Lord," &s;aid he, to the Corin|thians, "<HI>that</HI> which I al&s;o <HI>delivered unto you;</HI> that the Lord Je&s;us, the &s;ame night in which he was betrayed, took bread; and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and &s;aid; Take eat; this is my Body which is broken for you; <HI>this do</HI> in remembrance of me. After the &s;ame manner he took the cup, when he had &s;upped, &s;aying; This cup is the New-Te&s;tament in my blood; <HI>this do,</HI> as often as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. For as often as you eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do &s;hew the Lord's death until he comes."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xi. 23 to 26.</NOTE></P>
<P>To prevent our unworthy reception of this &s;acrament, we are entreated previou&s;ly to <HI>examine</HI> whether we have that preparation which it requires. "But let a man <HI>examine him&s;elf,</HI> and <HI>&s;o let him eat</HI> of that bread, and drink of that cup."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. ver. 28.</NOTE></P>
<P>The&s;e, and other expre&s;&s;ions of Saint Paul, clearly enforce on us this duty. And as it is al&s;o enjoined on us by the <HI>law</HI> of <HI>gratitude,</HI> it may mo&s;t ju&s;tly be affirmed, that there is not any precept of &s;acred writ <HI>more explicitly,</HI> nor <HI>more forcibly,</HI> enjoined on us, than is the <HI>injunction,</HI> in the text, that requires us to be partakers of this holy &s;acrament.</P>
<P>As this fact cannot, con&s;i&s;tent with our religious princi|ples, be que&s;tioned by any of us, we &s;hall now,</P>
<P>THIRDLY, attend to the <HI>qualifications</HI> requi&s;ite to our <HI>due ob&s;ervance</HI> of this ordinance.</P>
<P>We perceive, from what hath been &s;aid, that the <HI>princi|pal intention</HI> of this &s;acrament, is to <HI>pre&s;erve</HI> in <HI>our minds</HI> a <HI>&s;en&s;e of gratitude</HI> for the <HI>love of</HI> CHRIST in effecting our &s;alvation, by virtue of his death.</P>
<P>But is it po&s;&s;ible our hearts can be <HI>duly impre&s;&s;ed</HI> with a
<PB N="68" REF="021347_0065_0FB31C4ACE8339A8">
&s;en&s;e of thankfulne&s;s to Chri&s;t, while we are in a <HI>&s;tate</HI> of <HI>im|penitence;</HI> not entitled to the ble&s;&s;ings of the go&s;pel, and re|gardle&s;s of it's &s;acred precepts?</P>
<P>Impo&s;&s;ible is it for the per&s;on who is a &s;tranger to repen|tance; de&s;titute of faith in Chri&s;t, and inattentive to the di|vine commands, to be an heir of &s;alvation; to be <HI>truly thank|ful</HI> for the mercies of Chri&s;t; or to render him an acceptable &s;ervice.</P>
<P>But when we are chri&s;tians indeed, though our graces may be defective; our religious attainments imperfect, we <HI>are qualified</HI> to approach this ordinance; we have that pre|paration, which, in the judgment of our church, is requi&s;ite to our being <HI>worthy partakers</HI> of this &s;acrament; for then we "truly repent of our former &s;ins; &s;teadfa&s;tly purpo&s;e to lead a new life; have a lively faith in God's mercy, through Chri&s;t; a thankful remembrance of his death, and are in charity with all men."</P>
<P>A moment's reflection would be &s;ufficient to convince us, that it would be, mo&s;t ab&s;urd and criminal, for a profe&s;&s;ed INFIDEL to receive this &s;acrament. But the per&s;on who <HI>profe&s;&s;es</HI> to <HI>believe</HI> in the chri&s;tian faith, but <HI>demes it</HI> in <HI>prac|tice,</HI> is, perhaps, more guilty than &s;uch a character; and as &s;inful, at lea&s;t, would it be, for an impious chri&s;tian to par|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ake of this holy ordinance, as for one who does not pro|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s to believe in divine revelation.</P>
<P>The per&s;on, therefore, of impenitence; of practical in|fidelity; of impurity of heart and life; de&s;titute of righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, mu&s;t be <HI>unprepared</HI> to celebrate the pa&s;&s;ion of our Lord.</P>
<P>We ha&s;ten to the <HI>fourth</HI> propo&s;ition, which was to notice &s;ome of the <HI>advantages</HI> which <HI>attend</HI> the <HI>worthy reception</HI> of this &s;acrament.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid that it is beneficial to us, in &s;everal re|&s;pects.</P>
<P>It will occa&s;ion our ob&s;ervance of the divine precepts to be <HI>more perfect,</HI> and <HI>acceptable</HI> to the Almighty.</P>
<P>No obedience can be plea&s;ing to God, that <HI>proceeds not</HI> from LOVE. The obedience of SERVILITY and FEAR,

cannot be acceptable to the Deity; who requires the free-will offering of the heart.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxiii. 26.</NOTE> And impo&s;&s;ible is it, that we &s;hould love God, unle&s;s we &s;hall be convinced of the excel|lence of his nature; or be &s;en&s;ible of his love to us. As, in this &s;acrament, we commemorate the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t, we have the highe&s;t te&s;timony of the Almighty's affection for us, in giving the &s;on of his love to be a propitiatory &s;a|crifice for our &s;ins; our hearts, therefore, we may rea&s;ona|bly hope, will be impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of love to the God of beneficence. And thus, while we are rendering to God a <HI>mo&s;t rational tribute</HI> of <HI>gratitude,</HI> we are <HI>excited</HI> and <HI>enabled,</HI> with <HI>greater perfection,</HI> and <HI>more acceptably,</HI> to <HI>honor</HI> his <HI>laws.</HI></P>
<P>When we duly commemorate the pa&s;&s;ion of our Lord, and have a lively &s;en&s;e of the <HI>ignominy</HI> of his death; of his excruciating pangs, both of body and &s;oul, which he endur|ed to atone for our guilt, can we be <HI>in&s;en&s;ible</HI> of the <HI>demerits</HI> of <HI>&s;in;</HI> of the puni&s;hment due to the violation of the divine law? And, con&s;equently, mu&s;t not our hatred again&s;t &s;in be increa&s;ed; our re&s;olutions of virtue be &s;trengthened?</P>
<P>When, in this ordinance, we receive the &s;ymbols of our Saviour's pa&s;&s;ion, while our <HI>faith thereby</HI> &s;hall be increa&s;ed, will not our <HI>hearts</HI> be <HI>expanded</HI> with CHARITY to <HI>all men,</HI> even to our <HI>enemies.</HI></P>
<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible to have proper conceptions of the love of Chri&s;t, manife&s;ted in his death, to all men; to the mo&s;t guilty and unworthy; to his greate&s;t enemies, even his mur|therers, and not feel compa&s;&s;ion for our greate&s;t foes; not be de&s;irous of advancing the felicity of all mankind?</P>
<P>Among other benefits, we might enumerate, which will be derived to us, by our worthy reception of this &s;acrament, we &s;hall only mention, that thereby we &s;hall obtain <HI>ab&s;oluti|on</HI> for our <HI>&s;ins;</HI> and al&s;o, have our <HI>hearts repleni&s;hed</HI> with <HI>grace;</HI> or, in the language of our communion office, we &s;hall "&s;piritually eat the fle&s;h of Chri&s;t, and drink his blood;

<P>"We receive," &s;ays <HI>Saint Cyprian,</HI> "the Euchari&s;t <HI>every day,</HI> as the food that nouri&s;hes us to &s;alvation."</P>
<P><HI>Saint Ambro&s;e</HI> mentions that <HI>this cu&s;tom</HI> prevailed in the Dioce&s;s of Milan.</P>
<P><HI>Saint Jerome</HI> informs us, that <HI>this practice</HI> obtained al&s;o in the church of Rome.</P>
<P>And <HI>Saint Augu&s;tin</HI> intimates, that it was <HI>not uncommon</HI> in his time.</P>
<P>In the churches of the <HI>ea&s;t,</HI> this cu&s;tom began fir&s;t to de|cline. Saint <HI>Ba&s;il</HI> tells us, that, in his days, they communi|cated <HI>four times a week;</HI> on the Lord's day, Wedne&s;day, Fri|day and Saturday, and al&s;o upon other days, if the memory or fe&s;tival of any martyr fell upon them.</P>
<P>Afterwards, as the power of religion began more &s;en&s;ibly to <HI>decay,</HI> this &s;acrament was received by the church <HI>once</HI> or <HI>twice</HI> only a <HI>week;</HI> in &s;ome time thereafter, but <HI>once</HI> a <HI>month,</HI> and, in proce&s;s of time, in mo&s;t churches, but <HI>three times in a year,</HI> viz. at Chri&s;tmas, Ea&s;ter and Wit&s;untide. See <HI>Cave's</HI> Primitive Chri&s;tianity, Chap. XI. Page 339, 340.</P>
<P>Originally, ALL the members of the church <HI>communicat|ed;</HI> but as chri&s;tians increa&s;ed in number, a more <HI>exact di&s;|cipline,</HI> in this re&s;pect, became nece&s;&s;ary. None were ad|mitted to this ordinance until they had arrived to the degree of the <HI>faithful;</HI> for <HI>catechumens,</HI> and &s;uch as for &s;ome crime, were under the <HI>cen&s;ure</HI> and <HI>&s;u&s;pen&s;ion</HI> of the church, and had not pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;everal &s;tages of <HI>penitents,</HI> were not allowed to communicate, but commanded to <HI>depart</HI> from the church when this &s;acrament was admini&s;tered. Ibid. P. 333.</P>
<P>All tho&s;e, however, who were baptized, and again&s;t who&s;e conduct no exception was made, were not only <HI>permitted,</HI> but, by the rules of the church, <HI>obliged</HI> to communicate, un|der pain of eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t ancient canons are very expre&s;s to this purpo&s;e. Among tho&s;e &s;tiled the <HI>apo&s;tolical canons,</HI> there is one in the following words. "All &s;uch of the faithful as come to church, and hear the &s;criptures read, but <HI>&s;tay not</HI> to the prayers, <HI>nor partake</HI> of the <HI>holy communion,</HI> ought to be <HI>&s;u&s;|pended</HI> as authors of <HI>di&s;order</HI> in the church."</P>
<P>Which canon the <HI>council</HI> of <HI>Antioch</HI> repeats with a little enlargement. "All &s;uch as come into the church of God, and hear the holy &s;criptures read, but <HI>do not communicate</HI> with the people in prayer, and <HI>refu&s;e</HI> to <HI>partake</HI> of the <HI>Euchari&s;t,</HI> which is a <HI>di&s;orderly practice,</HI> ought to be <HI>ca&s;t out</HI> of the <HI>church,</HI> 'till they confe&s;s their fault, and bring forth fruit of repentance; when they do &s;o, if they a&s;k pardon, they may obtain it." See Bingham's Antiquities of the chri&s;tian church, Vol. I. Book XV. Chap. IV. Fol. 769.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t ages of chri&s;tianity, not only <HI>catechumens</HI> and tho&s;e <HI>under penance,</HI> but <HI>all</HI> the <HI>other</HI> members of the church, except communicants, were required to <HI>withdraw</HI> when this holy &s;acrament was di&s;pen&s;ed.</P>
<P>But in the days of <HI>Saint Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;o&s;tom,</HI> there were &s;ome who reque&s;ted the privilege to be <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> during the performance of the whole office of the communion, without being <HI>obliged</HI> to <HI>communicate.</HI> They were not willing to be accounted <HI>penitents,</HI> and to be <HI>&s;hut out</HI> of the church with them; nor yet, would they be <HI>communicants.</HI> Again&s;t <HI>&s;uch</HI> per&s;ons, this <HI>eloquent father</HI> inveighs with a con&s;iderable degree of ani|mation.</P>
<P>"Are you <HI>unworthy,</HI>" &s;aid he to them, "of the &s;acrifice, and unfit to partake of it? Neither then are you <HI>worthy</HI> of the <HI>prayers.</HI>"</P>
<P>Do you not hear the church's herald proclaiming, "All ye who are <HI>penitents withdraw!</HI>" All tho&s;e who do not cum|municate, are penitents. If thou art of the number of peni|tents, thou maye&s;t not partake. For he who is not a par|taker, is a penitent.</P>
<P>Why does he &s;ay; "All ye who cannot pray, depart?" And why do you impudently &s;tay?</P>
<P>I am not one of tho&s;e, will you &s;ay, but of &s;uch as may partake. Con&s;ider, I pray you, and &s;eriou&s;ly weigh the matter. The royal table is prepared; angels give their at|tendance; the Lord him&s;elf is pre&s;ent, and do you &s;tand yawning as an idle &s;pectator only?</P>
<P>Your <HI>garments</HI> are <HI>defiled,</HI> and are you under <HI>no concern?</HI> But will you &s;ay, they are clean. Then &s;it down and par|take!</P>
<P>The king comes daily to &s;ee the gue&s;ts, and di&s;cour&s;es with them all. And now he &s;ays in your con&s;ciences; friends, how came you to &s;tand here, not having on a wed|ding garment? He &s;aid not, why art thou &s;et down? But before he was &s;et down, he pronounced him unworthy. For he &s;aid not, Why art thou <HI>&s;et down?</HI> But, <HI>Why came&s;t thou in hither?</HI> The &s;ame now he &s;ays to every one who &s;tandeth here with an impudent boldne&s;s. For every one who doth not partake, is &s;hamele&s;s and impudent.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are in &s;in, are for that, fir&s;t ca&s;t out. As none of tho&s;e who are not initiated into the church by bap|ti&s;m, &s;hould be pre&s;ent; &s;o neither &s;hould any who are initi|ated, if they are defiled.</P>
<P>Tell me, if any one who is invited to a fea&s;t, wa&s;hes his hands, and &s;its down, and is prepared for the table, and yet <HI>eats not,</HI> does he not <HI>affront</HI> the per&s;on who invited him? Were it not better that &s;uch an one &s;hould not be pre&s;ent?</P>
<P>In like manner, thou art pre&s;ent; thou ha&s;t &s;ung the hymn, and made profe&s;&s;ion with the re&s;t, that thou art of tho&s;e who are worthy, ina&s;much as thou did&s;t not depart with the un|worthy. How is it that thou remaine&s;t, and yet do&s;t not partake at the table? Art thou unworthy? Thou art then unworthy al&s;o of the communion of prayers." Chry&s;. Hom. III. in Ephe&s;.

<P><PB N="74" REF="021347_0071_0FB31C586D6BCEC0">But if tho&s;e who make this objection, are <HI>not</HI> the <HI>aggre&s;|&s;ors;</HI> but have been injured, they have only to <HI>forgive</HI> the injury, and then, agreeable to the dictates of rea&s;on and re|ligion, they are at <HI>liberty</HI> to attend on this ordinance.</P>
<P>There are others, who ab&s;ent them&s;elves from the Lord's table, becau&s;e they apprehend it is approached by &s;ome per|&s;ons of <HI>immoral character.</HI></P>
<P>It may, indeed, &s;ome times, be thus. There may be tho&s;e, who, as <HI>Saint Augu&s;tin</HI> ob&s;erves, "pre&s;s the &s;acred elements with their teeth, when they do not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mbrace Chri&s;t with their hearts."</P>
<P>We &s;hould not, however, he <HI>ha&s;ty</HI> to <HI>cen&s;ure</HI> our chri&s;|tian brother; but rather be inclined, with an holy &s;everity, to judge our&s;elves.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t, notwith&s;tanding, be the <HI>duty</HI> of the governors of every church, upon <HI>proper information,</HI> to examine into the charge of immoral conduct again&s;t communicants; and, if convinced of their impiety, to &s;u&s;pend them the privilege of the communion, until they &s;hall offer &s;ufficient te&s;timony of their reformation.</P>
<P>Imperfect, indeed, mu&s;t be the di&s;cipline of that church, which <HI>knowingly</HI> admits unworthy characters to partake of this holy &s;acrament!</P>
<P>But it is mo&s;t true, that &s;uch per&s;ons, pollute the ordi|nance only to them&s;elves; for, in the language of an apo&s;tle, "to the pure, all thing are pure."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Titus i. 15.</NOTE> We cannot &s;uppo&s;e, that our Lord would have &s;uffered Judas to have received this &s;acrament, had his pre&s;ence polluted it to any but him&s;elf.</P>
<P>There are others, who, <HI>through</HI> FEAR, are prevented from commemorating the death of Chri&s;t. They imagine they are <HI>unworthy</HI> to approach the Lord's table; and that &s;hould they "eat and drink unworthily, they would eat and drink <HI>damnation</HI> to them&s;elves."</P>
<P>Such, are per&s;ons of vice, or virtue. If they are devoid of that religion the go&s;pel requires, "wherefore do they not repent, and amend? Why will they render that as <HI>an excu&s;e</HI>
<PB N="75" REF="021347_0072_0FB31C5AC146E780">
for not performing this duty, which reflects &s;o much <HI>di&s;grace</HI> on them&s;elves; and, from which through divine aid, they can obtain deliverance?</P>
<P>Or why will they incline to <HI>continue</HI> in that &s;tate, which occa&s;ions them to be unprepared for death; unfit indeed to offer the Almighty any act of devotion, either of prayer, or prai&s;e? For "the &s;acrifice of the <HI>wicked</HI> is an abomination to the Lord."</P>
<P>If tho&s;e who apprehend they are unworthy to commune, are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of penitence for &s;in; faith in Chri&s;t; hearts of &s;incerity, and purity, and unfeigned de&s;ires and re&s;olutions, to obey the divine commands, to the utmo&s;t of their ability, they will be acceptable gue&s;ts at this holy banquet; for we are a&s;&s;ured, that "God accepteth according to what a man <HI>hath;</HI> and not according to that which he <HI>hath not.</HI>"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. viii. 12.</NOTE></P>
<P>Such per&s;ons, therefore, <HI>&s;hould not</HI> be <HI>intimidated</HI> from di&s;charging their duty, in this in&s;tance. Practice, in all pro|bability, will render them <HI>more perfect</HI> in the performance of it; and, if in virtue, they have not arrived to the greate&s;t degree of perfection, the con&s;ideration, that the ob&s;ervance of <HI>this duty</HI> will have a tendency to <HI>promote</HI> their <HI>growth</HI> in GRACE, and <HI>e&s;tabli&s;h</HI> them in GOODNESS, &s;hould be a <HI>forcible incentive</HI> to <HI>engage</HI> them in the <HI>practice</HI> of this <HI>rea|&s;onable</HI> and advantageous &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who receive this &s;acrament, while in a &s;tate of im|penitence; or to accompli&s;h &s;ini&s;ter views; or through the prevalence of cu&s;tom; or with di&s;&s;imulation, or irreverance, unque&s;tionably, receive it in an <HI>unworthy manner,</HI> and with|out any benefit to them&s;elves. And though the <HI>&s;in</HI> of <HI>&s;uch</HI> is <HI>great,</HI> it is NOT <HI>unpardonable.</HI></P>
<P>Some members of the church of Corinth, even while in a <HI>&s;tate</HI> of <HI>intoxication,</HI> partook of this ordinance. This oc|ca&s;ioned them "not to <HI>di&s;cern</HI> the Lord's body." And &s;uch conduct, this gro&s;s profanation of this in&s;titution, was &s;o offen&s;ive to God, that he inflicted on them temporal judg|ments, that they might not again be chargeable with &s;uch impiety.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="021347_0073_0FB31C5CA8A82848">"He that eateth and drinketh unworthily," &s;aid St. Paul, "eateth and drinketh damnation to him&s;elf;" or provokes God to inflict &s;ome judgment upon him, that he may be re|claimed from this &s;in; for the word rendered <HI>damnation,</HI> in the original, &s;ignifies <HI>judgment.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The word, in this pa&s;&s;age of &s;acred writ, that is tran&s;|lated <HI>damnation,</HI> is <HI>krima,</HI> which imports <HI>temporal judgment.</HI> The <HI>&s;ame word</HI> is u&s;ed by Saint Peter, 1 Ep. iv. 17. "The time is come that <HI>judgment</HI> mu&s;t begin at the hou&s;e of God."</NOTE></P>
<P>"For this cau&s;e," added our apo&s;tle, "many are weakly and &s;ickly among you, and many &s;leep," or are dead. "If we would judge our&s;elves we &s;hould not be judged. But when we are judged, we are cha&s;tened of the Lord that we &s;hould not be condemned with the world."</P>
<P>We &s;hall mention but one particular more, which, we fear, prevents &s;ome from attending on this holy ordinance; though there are not any, perhaps, &s;o candid as to acknow|ledge it; and this is an apprehen&s;ion, that if, they &s;hall par|take of this &s;acrament, they will be <HI>obliged</HI> to be <HI>more cir|cum&s;pect</HI> and <HI>holy</HI> in their <HI>deportment;</HI> and that the &s;ame evil action would be more criminal in them, &s;hould they become communicants, than it is while they do not receive this &s;acra|ment.</P>
<P>Such conduct mu&s;t evince great <HI>depravity</HI> of heart, as well as <HI>ignorance</HI> of the nature of chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>What <HI>new</HI> obligation of virtue is enjoined upon us when we <HI>receive</HI> this &s;acrament?</P>
<P>When we &s;ubmit to the ordinance of bapti&s;m, are we not obligated to perform <HI>each duty</HI> of our religion, to the utmo&s;t of our ability?</P>
<P>We hope however, for the honor of chri&s;tianity, there are but <HI>few,</HI> who, from this <HI>mi&s;taken idea,</HI> decline the re|ception of this &s;acrament.</P>
<P>To conclude. Let &s;uch as <HI>are communicants,</HI> approach this holy ordinance with reverence; with hearts of humility, faith, &s;incerity, charity, purity and gratitude!</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="021347_0074_0FB31C5D98BA3340">That they may be duly thankful for the love of Chri&s;t, which they will recogni&s;e, let them reflect on the <HI>dignity</HI> of his character; upon "the length and breadth, depth and height" of his &s;ufferings; and upon the <HI>happy effects</HI> of his pa&s;&s;ion; that it will not only deliver them from everla&s;ting and inexpre&s;&s;ible infamy and woe, but exalt them to never ending and inconceivable honor, glory and happine&s;s!</P>
<P>And let &s;uch humbly a&s;&s;ure them&s;elves, that the divine Saviour will graciou&s;ly conde&s;cend to meet them at his table; to indulge them with his &s;miles; to repleni&s;h their hearts with grace; to favour them with his ble&s;&s;ing!</P>

<P>From an ardent de&s;ire to render obedience to the will of Heaven; from an humble reliance on the divine goodne&s;s to pity his infirmities, and from a de&s;ire to make advance|ment in the chri&s;tian life, let him re&s;olve, in as perfect a manner as po&s;&s;ible, to commemorate the love of the merciful Saviour!</P>
<P>Let <HI>tho&s;e</HI> who have been <HI>inattentive</HI> to this <HI>&s;acred in&s;ti|tution,</HI> who have not perhaps, be&s;towed on it <HI>one &s;erious thought,</HI> be intreated, without delay, to take it into their &s;e|rious con&s;ideration!</P>
